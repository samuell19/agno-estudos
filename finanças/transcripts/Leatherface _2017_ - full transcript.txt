[SCREAMS] [SIREN WAILING] [CAR APPROACHES, ENGINE SHUTS OFF] - [CAR DOOR SLAMS] - Where is she? [COP] Take it easy, Hal. - Let me through, goddamn it! - Hold it! Hold it! Get off me! Get the fuck off me! We'll figure out what happened. - Easy there, Hal. - That's my baby in there. [GRUNTS] Is she in there? Is my baby in there? Answer me, goddamn it! We got one of them. Ahh... [PANTING] [GROANS] [CRYING] I couldn't get to her on time. [SNIFFLES] I'm real sorry, sir. I swear to God. [HAL] Drayton Sawyer. This time it ain't the Gorman House. Nah. You're grown up now. That means the gas chamber for you. [CHUCKLES] For what? You arrestin' me for finding the body? That ain't no crime I heard of. How about I put a bullet right in your fuckin' skull, huh? - [COP 1] Hold on. - [COP 2] Put it away, Hal. - Come on, now. - He's right. We ain't got nothin' on him. [COP 1] Easy, Hal. Keep your head on. - [COP 2] Hal, he ain't worth it. - [COP 3] Come on, Hal. Put the gun down. Fuckin' trash. [CHATTER OVER POLICE RADIO] You let those boys go this instant. Don't count on it, Verna. You see them do something wrong? No. No. I didn't think so. You uncuff him! You let him out of the car! No. He's stayin' right there. What for? He's not under arrest. He's under protection. - From you. - What are you talkin' about? I can't count how many crime scenes I've been to where there just happened to be Sawyers there already. - Them kids ain't safe with you. - Horseshit. Send some units over to the Sawyer house. You round up all the minors. I want all of them. - You hear me? - You can't do that. You can't do that. Well, I'll have a warrant that says I can by the time we arrive. It's called child endangerment. You take one of mine... and I'll take all yours, Verna. All of 'em. [MAN] In 1935, the state of Texas instituted a endangered childcare program. The first year, nearly 50 children were taken from homes where criminal activity was the norm. Most of these children were given new names and entered into foster care. Others, the product of degenerate parentage, were remitted here to Gorman House. You'll take care of their psychological, physical needs. Yes, sir. I've been wanting to come on here for a long time. - I think I can help them. - Elizabeth. Oh, please, sir. Lizzy's... Lizzy's fine. Elizabeth. Most of these kids will end up in prison or mental institutions. Keeping them here is safer for everyone. Keep your guard up. [LOW CHATTER] - [DOOR CLOSES] - [LOCK CLICKS] [MAN SINGING ON RADIO, INDISTINCT] [HUMMING MELODY] [BOOKS BANGING] [WOMAN GIGGLING] [WOMAN 2] Can I get some water? I'm thirsty. Well, hello. My name is Lizzy. I'm new here, and I want to get to know y'all. [GRUNTS] Oh. That's Bud. You don't say all that much, do you, big guy? [MAN] Nuh-uh. Uh-uh. - Uh... You're in my seat. - Oh. Sorry. Thank you kindly. - Uh, I'm... - Lizzy. Yeah, I heard. I heard. Shit. Sorry. I'm Jackson. Jackson and Bud. And what meds we have you on, Jackson? Meds, huh? They give 'em to us and we take 'em, right? [LAUGHING] We figured you'd know more about all of that than us, Lizzy. You aren't gonna be trouble for me, are you? No, not me, Lizzy. Is there a reason you keep saying my name like that? No, uh... I reckon I might like how it sounds, is all. - [LOUD SLAM] - Fuck you, asshole! I'll pop your eyes right the fuck out of your head! - Let him go. - Mind your own business! Is it my business. What is the problem? He said some things I didn't care for. Something about a girl in a nurse uniform, what she might taste like. Hey! Hey! Get off me! Let go! Fuck you, Frankenstein! Break it up, pinheads! - Back to what you were doing. - I didn't do nothin'. [SOFTLY] I didn't do nothin'. Don't look at me. [SIGHS] [EXHALES] [SIGHS] - [WOMAN GROANS IN DISTANCE] - [SCUFFLING] [SCUFFLING CONTINUES] [CLATTERING] - [YELPS] - [GASPS] [WOMAN GRUNTING] [CHOKING] What-What are you doing? [COUGHING] Come here. [WHIMPERS, GRUNTS] [SCREAMING] What's the big deal? It was just a stupid mouse. [SQUEAKING] Got a light? You're not allowed to smoke in here. [CHUCKLES] I got me special permission. True story. You can ask Dr. Lang. - I will. - He'll tell you it helps me. On account of my anxiety. [CHUCKLES] Truth is... it's 'cause I'm his favorite. He told me so. - You just got yourself a warnin'. - For what? - I was takin' a bath. - Get out. Bitch. Everything all right? Uh, yes, Dr. Lang. I'm... I'm fine. [CLEARS THROAT] I'll have a word with Isaac and... Bud. No, Bud didn't do nothin'. Lookin' forward to our session tomorrow, Jackson? Um, sir, he's right, actually. Bud didn't do anything. He was just fighting? Well, he was protecting me. Remind me to tell you later what he did to his last foster family. They took away his dog. [LANG SIGHS] Yes? That's a perfectly good reason to bludgeon somebody into a coma? Yeah, well, I'm just sayin'. [GASPS] I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. You didn't. Thanks for helping Bud. I know you don't even know him, so that's, um... that's nice. Well, I'm here to help you all. So... You're the first nice one we've had around here. So I thought you should know. Know what? What goes on in the ECT chamber. Kids around here got to callin' that "Dr. Lang's Chamber of Horrors." Piece of shit. Why is that? You drop by tonight, you can find out for yourself. I think maybe you could even do something about it. Yeah. Jackson. You're gonna get out of here someday. And just cause you can't trust certain people... it doesn't mean you shouldn't trust others. Yeah, I'll think about that. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Barry Farnsworth. We've been here an hour. Uh, we? [LANG] Miss Sawyer. [FARNSWORTH] It's Mrs. Carson now. I want to see Jed. We've been through this before. Year after year. He's my son. And I can afford me a lawyer now. This changes nothin'. He was taken from you for a reason. Show him. It's an injunction. Court says Mrs. Carson has the right to visit. You have to let me see him. You bring me Jed. Well, that's a problem. Most of these kids are given a new name... so they can hide from their degenerate... criminal families. Jed probably wouldn't be able to recall you or even his real name. But you know who he is. You and that sideways ranger. You know 'em all. I have a lot of patients. We'll have to check the records to be certain. That's bullshit. [SCOFFS] And that requires an entirely different court order. The records are very sensitive. Get me the correct court order, I'll be happy to help you. Oh, that one took three months to get! Then I advise you to get on it quick! Jed is 18 soon. I'll recommend he be transferred to prison. You're a bastard. Even though you married into money and hired yourself a snot-nose shyster, you are still hillbilly trash. [DOOR SLAMS] [FARNSWORTH] I have a friend, a country clerk. Maybe he can push it through. - Don't matter! It's all bullshit! - Whoa. Whoa. Lavatory. That way. [LOUD GRUNTING] [MAN] I warned you, Bud, but you wouldn't listen. Come on. Man up, Bud. This is for your own good. [BUD GRUNTING] [SHOUTING IN DISTANCE] [SHOUTING CONTINUES] [MAN] Calm down. [CONTINUES, INDISTINCT] Go get her. Office hours are over. I can't go into the ladies' room. [KNOCKING] - Ma'am? - It's Mrs. Carson. [DOOR OPENS] Goddamn it. She's gone! [GRUNTS] Get... off me! Get out... [KEYS JINGLING] Jed, I'm coming! - [VERNA] Jed! Jed! - [MAN] What was that? [VERNA] I'm here for you! [ALL MURMURING] - You hear me? - [WOMAN] What is that? [BUD WHIMPERING] [LANG] You're next, Isaac. Are we ready?

[SHOUTING CONTINUES] [RINGING CONTINUES] [LAUGHING, SHOUTING] [MAN] Come on! [WOMAN] Lizzy. Come quick. Kids are loose in the halls. [VERNA] Jed, I'm coming! Jed? Jed. Get your hands off me! Hey! [GRUNTS] [INDISTINCT] [FARNSWORTH] My client was acting in self-defense. Get out. She was... [SHOUTING CONTINUES IN DISTANCE] [RINGING CONTINUES] That's it. Lock it down. [MAN] Whoo-hoo! [ALARM STOPS] [NURSE SCREAMING] [SHOUTING, SCREAMING] I can't believe you did that. [GASPING] [INMATES SHOUTING] [GLASS BREAKING] Want to give me a hand? [WOMAN] I saw you with him. And you know that Ike is my soulmate. [CHOKING] - [DOOR SLAMS OPEN] - [INMATES SHOUTING] There's an emergency exit in the basement. Come on, follow me! I told you a thousand times we're understaffed. Just get here before they... [BANGING] Uh... Just hurry. [HANGS UP PHONE] - [BANGING] - Who's there? [BANGING CONTINUES] [GRUNTING] [OBJECT CLATTERS] Don't be stupid, Bud. Bud? They'll never let you go. Think about it, Bud! Let's get the fuck out of here, y'all! Ike, where you at? Ike! [LAUGHS] [SHRIEKING] [MOANING] [MOANING] [CACKLING] [MOANING] [MOANING] - [INMATES SHOUTING] - [GLASS BREAKING] - Let's hide. - Let's hide! Right here. [WHIMPERING] [NURSE SCREAMING] [SCREAMING STOPS] [JACKSON ROARING] [SCREAMS] [WHIMPERING] Come on. [IKE] Jackson's got a hostage. Hey, what's up? Hey, Doc has a nice ride. - Don't touch him! - [LIZZY] Let go of me! Get going! - [IKE] Be quiet! - [LIZZY] Let go! - [GROANS] - You fuck! [LIZZY SCREAMS] [ROCK ON CAR RADIO] [IKE] They'll think twice about shooting us down with her along. [WOMAN] Yes, they will! [WHOOPING, TRILLING, HOOTING] [SCREAMING] [WOMAN CACKLING] [SONG CONTINUES] [IKE] Hey. Hop in, stupid. I owe you one. [FEMALE SINGER] # That's the day I walk away # # A-walk-a-walk-a-walk-a-ooh # [SONG CONTINUES, INDISTINCT] [WOMAN] Fuck you, Gorman! Well, don't you look nice? You just had to bring the prettiest nurse along with us, didn't you? Oh... I didn't pick her. No, Jackson did. You got no reason to be jealous. Why'd I be jealous of someone who's about to die? Everything at the proper time. [GRUNTS] Jackson! Oh, here we go. Hey, where do you think you're going, bitch? - [GRUNTS] - [GROANS] Put me down, put me down. Fuck you! [WHIMPERING] [SCREAMING] Let go of me! Let go of me! Do that again, I'll turn you into strawberry pie. I'm gonna kill him, I'm gonna kill him... right before your eyes. And that goes for you two, as well. Anyone bolts, and everyone dies. - You son of a bitch. - [LIZZY] Jackson, wait. We're all gonna look out for each other. It's okay. Change. No, you ain't makin' her get undressed. Oh, ain't I? You got clothes underneath? All right. Cut it out, you bastard... before I slit her throat. That ain't no way to talk about our new friend. She's going with us all the way. Where are you takin' us? Mexico. Perhaps you've heard of it? Gonna find us some money, find us some more wheels. Go past Austin, see my mom. Y'all be... all be welcome there. My mama loves company. And soon as we get to the Mexican border, we go our separate ways. Jackson, you got someplace you want to get to? You got family somewhere? No. No, Mexico sounds like a plan. - [HAL] You Sorells? - Yes, sir. Glad you could make it. - We know which one did this? - No. We know who's missing. They're pulling up the files for us right now. Bet I know who it was. This ain't the work of a confused child. This is evil. Needs puttin' down. They all mine? All but one were brought in by you, yeah. Roadblocks set? - Ten. Twenty miles out. - Push 'em out more. I want every local cop from here to New Mexico on the lookout. Yes, sir. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello. They're loose. Cops lookin'? Yeah, of course we'll pay ya. You just keep us updated. We're gonna find Jed. [CHATTER ON POLICE RADIO] [CAR MOVES PAST] - Lang's car was just spotted. - Where? South on 385. I'll meet you there. Sorells. Yes, sir. Knowing these kids the way I do... they ain't givin' up easy. - I understand. - I don't think you do. Just 'cause they're kids, I don't want your men going soft. If they gotta shoot first and let God sort it out... Well, that's permissible. You copy that? Copy. [ENGINE STARTS] [WOMAN] Fuck, I'm hungry. I thought the plan was not to be seen. People looking for a group with a mongoloid. We go in separate. - And you stays outside. - [GRUNTS] You... stays quiet. - We have no money. - Blah, blah, fuckin' blah. We improvise. There's food, there's money, and there's cars to grab. Get in there. [ROCK AND ROLL PLAYS ON JUKEBOX] [IKE LAUGHING] Wanna see if I can throw it in your mouth? - Yeah. - Okay. Oh, yeah. [LAUGHING] You all right, darlin'? Ma'am. You haven't touched your food. I'm just not hungry, I guess. I'll bag it up for you. Throw it in my mouth. - Aah! - [BOTH LAUGH] What the fuck you lookin' at? Yeah, that's right, nothin'. Everybody think they can look down on us. It's not funny. You know... Why don't you, um, check to see if he's got a gun? He's got a gun. - Let's start some shit up. - Okay. I wish this was just normal. I wish we were just two people... here at a diner, you know. I wish I was somebody else. Sorry, y'all. That was my fault. [LAUGHS] Think it's time y'all clear out. Pay up and go. # We ain't got no money # [SCREAMING] [MAN] Goddamn! Holy shit!

Then they started shootin'. You see which way they went? What car they took? Maybe they left in a wagon. - What color? - Blue, I reckon. Or gray. A Ford. [JACKSON] Hey. Could have at least stolen a car with a full tank of gas. [IKE] I don't look at the gas gauge when someone's shooting me, asshole. [SHOTGUN COCKS] Quiet, now. Clarice, get over here. Get the door.

Big arms like that and that's all you got? [LIZZY] That's good. We just gotta put some pressure on it. Okay? Jesus. Man, you're lucky I love you. Want some of this? All right.

You know she's seen our files. So? So, she knows where all those foster moms who gave you shit live now. No, I don't. I only saw your medical charts. I swear. She's lying, Jackson. She says she doesn't know. Who cares if she saw anything? You don't want to find your family? [JACKSON] Bud's the only family I got. A real family. That's all I want. [CHUCKLES] I thought you said your family were in Austin. They'd be thrilled to see you, you know. They keep fuckin' movin'. I swear, I don't know. Come on, man. Let's leave her be, huh? Oh, you sweet on her now? Fine, lover boy. Hey, uh... Good luck getting it up with all the junk they got you on. Sleep tight, asshole. [JACKSON] Bud, you're on first watch. Get your ass out of bed.
