We understand you're experimenting with a new product. Would you care to explain yourself? Respectfully, Uncles great things are born of experimentation and vision. You have served us well, Victor. But your new interest concerns us. This is not why we sent you to America. Yes, that's true. But I have achieved my purpose. I simply want to pay back more. As a token of gratitude. This new product threatens our existing business. Have you given thought to that? Yes, I have. The threat is temporary and manageable. You have acted without authority. Without order, there's chaos. Respectfully, chaos can be used to our advantage. You have a good position here. Be satisfied. And don't be impatient. How did they know? Unh, unh, please. I didn't say anything, man. Don't you ever go to anyone else. Come to me first. Just so you don't forget. No. Oh, please. No! No! It's okay. That's what we look like. And we were in the middle of... Well, you can guess. And she says that to me. Ouch. She said that to you, heh? That's cold. Tell me about it. Whoa. Yee-ha! Okay, before we do anything, let me just figure this out. She wants you to ask her out but she says she doesn't wanna marry you. She sounds incredibly neurotic. I say, dump her. Let's go! Yee-ha. Can you hear a cellular phone? Uh, yeah. That must be Dad's. Did your father ask you to bring the phone? No. It's for emergencies. What kind of emergencies are we talking about? From your girlfriend? No. Ahem. Do you think Josh'll be ready for this next year? Uh, okay. So, listen. Do you wanna recall the last 300 or ya wanna... I think it's time to get our rocks off, twinkle toes. Ah. Feels good to be down. You did good today. You did good, man. Yeah? Hey, what's wrong? Hold him. Boom, boom, boom. I got him. In the head. Get him down. Get down. Get down. Down, down, down. Hey did you see us up there? - Yeah, it's pretty cool. Yeah? How'd we look? - Good. Where's your mom? She's over there. Do me a favor. Bring that for me. Where's my hat? I wanna go up there. Yeah, I'm sure you do. What's wrong? I miss my husband, and I wanna spend some time with him. Yowl. Oh. Argh! What are you talking about? Don't tell me we're going to spend the weekend together and then bring this. It's not fair. Hey, Mom, check this out. Look, baby, I, you know I had no... I still love you. Now make the call. He told me he wasn't gonna call. I'm sorry. Stand still. Whoa! Can you do that? Ya! Yeah, Bob. It's me. Grogan. Aw, come on! We just got here. What's wrong? Practice. I want you to practice. Now? Practice that. Okay. GROGAN:... Seattle. I don't give a shit. Well, Mike... - Fuck them! ...it looks like you got my husband for another weekend. Six months. This is the first weekend in six months that I've been with my family. He loves you guys very much. He's been looking forward to this weekend for a long time. I know. Give him a break, huh? You talk to me about it when you get married. Me, get married? Don't hold your breath, okay? Heh. I won't. Oh. How many guys? Yeah, yeah, he's right here... Okay. In two and a half hours we gotta go to Seattle. This is bullshit. I just want you to know this is bullshit. Yeah, fuck you too! I'm gettin' too old for this shit. It's time for a promotion. Maybe you should start thinkin' about that. Pfft, why? Are you gettin' sick of me? No, but if you move up, we all move up. And besides, you gotta start thinkin' of your family. That's true. Hey, guys. Hey, John, how you doin'? Uh, we got a new development, guys. Um, don't worry, your operation's still a go. At least as of the moment. I don't have all the specifics yet, but our sources tell us Tang's gonna be there in person. There must be a lot of product. Who's the other player? We're still workin' on the other player. How much prep time we got? Not enough. I got the layout in the van. You can go over it on the way. - Bodies? There'll be ten of you on the first team. It's a pretty contained area so we gotta make sure we don't blow your cover. Which means I'll be off site, with a backup. Don't worry, if things start to go sideways, we gotcha backed. All right? Okay, this is where the meet's gonna happen. We got shooters up top. Here, here, here, and here. We're comin' in on the ground. Now, if the product is not on site, we do not go in. Remember that. We don't eyeball this shit. We sit tight. Okay, there's a chance we don't even go in on this. Remember to keep channel two open for the shooters. That's it. They ruined our weekend for a fuckin' maybe. Chill, ladies. Nice suit. Move it out. Look alive, pal. Move. Move. Uncle. Good to see you, Victor. Okay. It's been awhile. So, what exactly do you want me to do? Well, I think of it more as what we can do for each other. My suppliers are already in place. Respectfully, your suppliers have old product. You're looking at the future. Nothing abstract about the concept. New product, new markets. New suppliers. Come on, let's move! But the demand is untested. Make no mistake. We would design it for addiction. No side effects like the old product. And look at the pharmaceutical companies, we simply eliminate the middleman. Rabble team, holding and clear. Okay, all clear. It's showtime, partner. How're you doing out there? Moving into position. Rabble team in position. And you produce it yourself? - Mm-hmm. Where? Heh. What kind of quantities can you handle? No limit. Okay, this is Grogan. We're in position number one. I gotta send Wilson in, over. Roger. Send him in. There are risks? Take risk crossing the street. I think more about the rewards. We're here, John. Outside shed three. Well, look. I have a good position. I have no desire to upset the status quo. You know? You call a life on your knees a good position? What the fuck was that? Come on somebody talk to me. Captain. We have bikers on the scene. Oh, beautiful. Beautiful. I don't remember reading this in the program. Change has many enemies, Victor. You and I both know, change is the only constant in life. Watch out, guys. There are no short cuts, Victor. I can't help you. Who the fuck is shooting? It's coming from inside shed three. Captain, this is Alpha team, we're standing by orders. We gotta go in now or we're gonna loose them. Mike, do not go in! Mike, Mike. Do not go in. Do not go in. I want backup and I want fucking backup now! You know what I always liked about you, Uncle? Nothing. Bravo team, we got those bikers tied up. We got backup on the way. Fuck! This is Ryan. I'm in shed three. We got one agent down and Tang is dead. Okay, Mike. I'm at number one, I'm coming to you. I am following a suspect heading eastbound. Come on, let's move! We're outta here! This is Wilson. I'm approaching shed four. Our friends are headed east, John. Yeah, Mike. I'm in the tunnel approaching shed five. They're between us. There's no way out. We've got 'em. Don't stop. We're losing ground. Over. Okay, Mike. I'm in shed number five. It looks clear. Got a man down. It's Wilson. Okay, I'm entering the machine shop. Machine shop is clear. I'm on my way to you. Okay, I'm goin' in. John, this is Mike. You gotta get out the building. Back off. You gotta get off of Mike. Do you copy? John? John? John's a little tied up right now. Can I take a message? Move. Come on, take it easy, man. You don't wanna do this. Save it for summer, punk. Think, man. Think about what you're doing, okay? If you're gonna shoot me, what are you gonna get for fucking shooting me, huh? You never know, it might relieve a little stress. Murder one, okay, murder one. You're just a fuckin' drug dealer. What, do you wanna shoot fuckin' cops, man? I could shoot right now. Michael! Mike! He's got my gun! He's got my gun, man! He's got it! Let him go! - Go away, we're bonding. Let him go! Hold it right there, Mike. Drop the gun! Shoot the fuck! Hold on! I can't get a line, John. You're in the way. Drop the gun! Don't drop it, Mike. Don't drop it! Shoot the fuck! Shoot him! Good night, Dick. My ride's here. No! Tang has been murdered. Victor Chow. I don't know what happened. We were right there. Now we've got five dead cops. We checked all the records of the boat description. Zilch on ID's. Zilch on ownership. Zilch on the make. Two years of scrapin' down back alleys and this is all we got. You tell me. How are we doin' on background? Yeah, we know this guy. He runs a little protection racket. - Got a file on this guy? - Yep. We pick him up three years ago. Assault charge. The guy wouldn't testify. He walked. No drugs? No. Any connections with Hong Kong? Not that we know of. - Then why kill Tang? I guess he wanted to expand. Look at this. The guy's a Stanford graduate. Biochemistry, philosophy. Mr. Big Brain. Get his picture out there and find this prick. Let's get this shit down to the lab. See what it is. See you back at the office. Ryan, I want you to... Ryan. Let's get you on a plane and get you home. You can't leave me outta this one, Captain. Michael. I know this is tough, but you gotta let it go. You've done your job. You're goin' home. Now, there's gonna be a full investigation into this entire operation. My advice is go home and get on with your life. I'd like you to be a pallbearer. I've got, uh, John's body coming in. There's so many arrangements to make and I don't even have a ticket for him yet. It's gonna be a non-denominational funeral because uh, well, John sort of made up his own religion as he went along. So, um, and he didn't believe in funerals. Don't worry. I'll take care of her. Good boy, Josh. He always said just throw him a big party. So that's what I'm gonna do. Throw him a big party. Do you know what bad timing is? Oh, it's you... You call that protection? I get more protection from a rubber. Look, you wanna be out a job and out of a life, keep it up. What's wrong? Nothing. ZHOU: MAN: ZHOU: All right, let's speed up production. Twenty-four hours a day. We need five hundred keys in two weeks. Don't make any mistakes. You understand? Yo, bartender. Get me a beer. Wait a minute. Get me one of those. Hi. My name's Mike Ryan. Okay. I'm looking for an asshole by the name of Victor Chow. Seen him around? Guess not, huh? Give me some change on that, huh? You know, um, Mike, you don't look like you're really fitting in around here. You see, I'm tryin' to penetrate the Chinese underworld. Really? Maybe I can help you. Great. Who are you lookin' for? A guy by the name of Victor Chow. Heh. That's cute. Thank you. Good luck. What's my name? Do you know my name? - Yeah, Mike Ryan. - Don't you forget it. Did you find who you're lookin' for? Not quite. But I'm getting warmer. Well, these guys have a lot of friends. You might wanna move on outta here. Thanks for the advice. You should be careful who you look for down here. People don't like attention. So you know those guys back there in the alley? Small timers who do enforcement contracts. Friends of yours? Heh. This is Chinatown. Everybody knows everybody. So, you know Victor Chow? Are you a cop, Mike? Does it matter? Why are you looking for him? It's a long story. Ooh, I like long stories. Not me. Jade, can I, uh, ask you a few questions? No, I don't think so. Well, can I at least walk you home? You just did. Good night, Mike. I'd like to talk with Victor Chow... Oh, I think he'll wanna speak with me. Tell him it's Jade. Come on. I got it. Come on guys, let's get this done. Let's go. I want you to wrap this up real quick. It's the last of it. Cordero. Oh. Hello. I thought the union says you gotta rest them ten minutes every hour. That's amusing, heh. Look, we got a way to make you more money than this. You know, that sounds very tempting, but uh, I can't help you, man. I'm maxed out. You're maxed out? Maxed out. Why is that? Well, you know, uh, I got a big deal with the Italians. And the Koreans. Oh, smart guy, that's right. And the Koreans. And the Russians. Hey well, you know how it is. Fuckin' guy. You're makin' us Americans feel left out, Cordero. Look, Chow. I'm just trying to make a living. Okay? So why don't you come back if you have something more substantial to offer? Put 'em down. Put 'em down. - Fuck you! - Get in the fuckin' van! Now, go! Go on. - Fuck you, Chow. You be nasty to me once, I'll be nasty to you two times! Then I owe you one, Cordero. Ow! Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, hey. Hey. Let's not blow this thing out of proportion. Don't you think it's a little late for that? Hey! Happy birthday, Cordero. Sorry I couldn't wrap it. What the hell is this? Hey. Come on, Chow, Chow. Come on, Chow, open the door. Come on. What is the matter with... Open up. Open the door Chow! Police. Drop the gun! I'm a cop. Drop the fuckin' gun now! There's a badge that goes with this. Slowly. There's a badge-- Shut the fuck up! Down. Down. Down, asshole! All right. All right. Take it easy, will ya? Look, just chill out. I'm a cop. Easy, Bobby. I know this guy. He's DEA. Hi, Mike. Mike, I know how you feel. I know, but you just have to let it go. These kind of things happen in this place. Hi, Captain. George. What are you doing here, Ryan? Sightseeing. You want me to arrest you? On what charge? Carrying a concealed weapon. Resisting arrest. General annoyance. That's bullshit, and you know it. It's too personal, Mike. Now, Chow is a local problem, and I'm fully capable of dealing with it. Detective Fong will take you to the airport. And I suggest you get on that plane and go home. Quite finished? Give him back his gun. Get the hell outta here. Come on, let's go. Why don't you do yourself a favor, and let me help you on this? What are you gonna tell me that I don't already know? Tang was the number one heroin dealer on the coast? That Chow wanted his place in line, so he took him out? Your partner is dead, Mike. Hey, hey easy, easy! Do you really believe that Chow is interested in heroin? Take a look at your crime scene. Along with those bad guys he just torched two hundred keys of product. Come on. Let's go, Mike. Come on. How long do you need? Twenty minutes. Make it ten. What the... George, my uncle always told me the superior man must be patient. But you only have two problems. I never liked him, and I never listened to him. Yeah. Take him out. Hmm. Got Price on it? Good. Keep him under wraps. Yeah, yeah. Be right there. What's up? We just got a tip on the lab operation that might be Chow's. Price is on his way. He says you're on, if you want. What do we got, Bobby? Uh, Chow and three Asian guys went in while I was waitin'. And, uh, Cutler's watchin' the back entrance. Backup's on the way? Yeah. We'll go join up with Cutler. What if they get spooked? Ryan. We wait. Backup will be here in a few minutes. We can't wait. What if we lose him? Bobby, you stay out here and wait for backup. We'll go check it out. You just killed my partner. And now you're gonna die. Doesn't look good, Tom, am I right? I'm gonna need to bring in the media on this. - Let me talk to your guy. - Bobby, come here. Bobby, are you all right? Yeah. Ya sure? Yeah. This is Commander Clarke of the DEA. Bobby. So, what happened? What happened? I saw Jim's car parked outside. I go inside looking for him, and that's when your fuckin' DEA guy comes out and he starts blastin' all over the place. I return fire, and he bolts. That's when I found Fong and Cutler. They were both dead. Do whatever you think you should do. You don't get along with people very well, do you? Chow's a dangerous man. Why are you after him? It's personal. You don't wanna tell me? I said, it's personal. Private. Ouch. He's grown very powerful. A lot of people here are afraid. Are you? Heh. Eh, they come, they go. It doesn't affect me. What are you gonna do when you find him? That's up to Chow. Are you tryin' to settle some gambling debts? No. He murdered my partner. Who just happened to be my best friend. So, you are a cop. Kinda. DEA. Sorry about your partner. I'm havin' a hard time figurin' out who my friends are down here. I'd really like to help you, Mike. But I can't. Maybe you can. Does this mean anything to you? Yeah. It's Chow's seal. If you see it on a business, it means they pay for his protection. So, how would they feel if he didn't do his job? He'd lose face. I'm done. Thanks. Well, I guess I should be going. You wanna stay here? That would be great. Hi, guys. I'm, uh, looking for a little Mah Jong action. I'll try upstairs. Come on. Get up! Gentlemen. My name's Mike Ryan. I'm looking for Victor Chow. I understand he provides protection for this little establishment. I want you to give him a message. Tell him Mike Ryan says Neh Ho Me. Say what? Yeah. Tell him I'd love to dance. The fuck. Where are you? I'm not quite sure. Ah, let me guess. Standing on the street corner, surrounded by Asians trying to cover your light skin and fair hair. You must be in trouble. Tell me where you are. I'll come and get you. Across the street, there's a restaurant. It's called Ho Ho's. Ring a bell? Yeah. I'll be there in about ten minutes. Keep a low profile. Chow has a lot of influence in that area. Are you sure you wanna do this? Not at all. I saw you on the news. It was a set-up. I was defending myself. Let's go to your place, huh? What do you mean you were set up? You know, it just all seemed too easy from the very beginning. Fong was good. Ya know, he... he really worked this well. Who would have known that he was in league with Chow? Then I turned around, and that other cop was firing at me. Once we got there everything changed, ya know. Jesus! Jade. Christ! Get down! Are you okay? Let's get the car. Jade, we'll take the bike. You're gonna kill me. You're gonna fucking kill me! What's goin' on, Mike? What's goin' on? Why don't you tell me what's going on? What do you mean? Heh. I come and help you. I get shot at. I think my life is in a little bit of danger. I need a light. Who the hell were the guys in the car, Jade? I don't know. Mr. Chow has some powerful enemies. Maybe they're just fighting back. What is it with you? Why don't you just walk away? Have you ever been pushed so far that you have no choice? I can't just walk away. When my partner was killed, he left behind a wife and a son. It was my fault. I can't go on with this thing hangin' over my head. I've gotta take care of it. Captain Kirk. JADE: You men almost killed me. Shit happens. Just figured you were a big enough girl to take care of yourself, Jade. It was hard to think properly with your men shooting at me. Maybe, you just need more practice. He's there, isn't he? JADE: Waste him. JADE: I've heard that somewhere before. Tell me where he is and we'll send someone. JADE: Oh, yeah, he scares me. But you scare me more, Jade. Look, business first. Tomorrow night. Then we get back to pleasure. Who was it? Doesn't matter. A girlfriend of mine knows a girl who services him regularly. Men are such creatures of habit. So, are you telling me you know where he is? Are you gonna kill him? Why do you care? I can deliver you into the fire. But will the flames cleanse you or consume you? That's a risk I have to take. Hello, Victor. You've got a great house. You can just take the gun out. Nice and easy. What? I'm a little early? No, everybody's just a little late. Where's the rest of your gang? I'm a selfish man, Victor. I want all of your attention. I'm into one night stands. I don't have that much attention to give. I used to follow the same path. But you changed everything. Ya got cop blood, Mike. You guys are all the same. You wanna be big and bad like us, but you guys are just fuckin' wimps. You can't shoot me. You gotta abide by the code. You've gotta take me. You're under arrest, Victor Chow. For the murder of DEA agent, John Grogan. Why don't you just shoot him, Mike? Go on, kill him. Now's your chance. You can say he was shot resisting arrest. What are you doing? No, Jade. I don't wanna do this Mike, but I don't have any choice. You gotta kill him for me, Mike. Then it'll be over. We can just walk out of here. You think she's so pure? You think she sells flowers on the street? She's an assassin. Shut up! You're unredeemable, Chow. Mr. Ryan. I believe we have a common enemy. Chow's tactics are good. "Begin by seizing something your opponent holds dear." "Then he will be amenable to your will." He has the advantage. Do you know how you will counter? No. He uses the girl to bring you to anger and recklessness. And ultimately, destruction. You must forget her, until the battle is won. Have no misconceptions, Mr. Ryan. She was raised to do an unpleasant, but necessary job. Victor is producing a synthetic drug that will bring chaos to your streets. It is in both of our interests to see that his operation is destroyed by you. And what makes you think that I'll work with you? Two men can be enemies. Yet, if they were crossing a river in the same boat, and caught by a storm they would come to each other's assistance. Just like the left hand helps the right. And when they get to the other side? They, once again, are enemies. As long as that is clearly understood. I'll be waiting in the car, Mr. Ryan. Sleeping Beauty awakens. Your plan's worked well, Victor. I'm very impressed. I love making good impressions. A shame you won't be alive to enjoy it. You think you really could have killed me? You're already dead, Victor. It's not my decision. You were so young and beautiful when you came to our family. But, my father would never approve of me sleeping with you. I wonder if he'd change his mind. I guess I should have asked him, before I killed him. We treated you like family. Where do you think he was then? Night after night? I've been dying since I was eight years old. Well, you picked the right profession. Dying's an occupational hazard for an assassin. This hurts me more than it hurts you. Why did you leave me? I'm not gonna let you go. I'm not gonna let you go. Get that guy! Where are you going? I knew you'd be back. Where is he? Get him! Get him! Cut him off! Come on! Shh. It's just you and me. Hey, Mikey. Just put her down. You have to wait your turn, man. I said put her down. Okay. Your turn, Mike! Come on! Play! What the hell did he do to you? Get the bastard. How's the music, Mike? Come on down. I got something for ya. Karma time, Mike. I got one more. You fuckin' joke. You're not a killer, you're a cop. How do you think you got here? That makes you one of us, Mike. Come on. It's for you, Mike. You look like shit. Where are you going, Ryan? I fucked your partner! Come back here, Ryan! Fuck you, loser! Ryan! Don't leave me! Ryan! Ryan! Oh, Sukien. Let me see you. Oh. Come here. I missed you. Look at you. Such a big girl. Oh, I love you. So you think you can handle this? Yeah. Are you ready? You bet. Let's do it.
