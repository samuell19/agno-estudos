You needn't all look so miserable. You must be a pretty bad doctor to let a profitable patient slip away at the age of 55. I should lose neither patient nor friend, if you are only sensible and rest. You can't fool me Dr.Manetta. Once my eye is closed tonight, they'll never open again on any of you. That's why I've asked you all here to give you my final instructions. I've appointed Havelock, trustee of the estate. Silva will be the boy's guardian, also an executor. It's all in here, signed and witnessed yesterday. Everything except a few small legacies goes to the boy. In the event of John's death, everything goes to his cousin, June living somewhere in Canada. You'll find particulars of her amongst the family papers. There are some legacies for all of you, though I've probably been overgenerous, don't fiddle. Tell Havelock to see that the real Selford jewels go into the vault with me and not imitations. If he doesn't fasten all the seven locks of that tomb, I'll come out and haunt the lot of you. Give me that box. Open it doctor. Are the seven keys there, Dr.Manetta? Yes. Havelock will have full charge of them. He may be a bit of a fool but he's trustworthy. Don't you agree, Dr.Manetta? Absolutely. Now please, do me a favor and drink this. Where is the boy? He is with his tutor. I want to see him as soon as I've had a final word with you about the seven keys. I'm saying good bye, John. I'm going on a pretty long journey and it'll be sometime before we meet again, but I want no tears, no fuss, understand? Chin up and smile, come on. Good bye, father. That's right. Good bye, Silva. See that he makes a better job of his life than I have made of mine. Now, we'll let your father sleep, shall we? Miss Lansdowne? Yes? A man threw this out of a window. What do you mean? I was delivering near the Northgate Nursing Home and he threw it out of the window with a 10-pound note. It had your name and address on it, so I brought it here. Good day, Miss. Telegram or flowers, darling. Neither. If it's from that Dego band conductor, I have nothing to do with them. I saw him first. It's a note from Silva. Now don't tell me, let me guess. Who'd have a name like that? I know, the waiter, the dark one. Beware of the waiter, darling. You'd never get any change out of those guys. Now, you ought to remember Silva. He's the one that sent you back $1,500 for your share on the trip. You mean that crazy guy who wrote to you in Quebec? Listen. "Dear Miss Lansdowne, on receipt of this message, come immediately to the above address and demand to see me. They will not dare to refuse you if you say who you are. I must tell you that the secret of the door with seven locks before I die and I have little time to spare. Come without delay. Yours Louis Silva. Put the key in a safe place and on no account bring it with you." Do you think we ought to go to the police? I don't want to be mixed up with the police. My father is Mayor of Backwood County. There seems to be something very unusual about this key. There's nothing unusual about a guy sending you his latch key. Did he say he wants you to come up and see his etching? Give me that towel will you, please? Now, here's a man in fear of his life and you make jokes about him. They will not dare to refuse you, who can they be? Say, what is this, puzzle corner? Well, I'm going to find out for myself. Not without your Aunt Glenda. Listen, I'm an old etching viewer myself but I know all the tricks. He'll be wearing George rack pajamas and the etchings will be, in the bedroom. The Lansdowne's girl now may learn where the key is. Supposing Silva talks too much. I'd be listening in the... That killer, you're crazy. Do you want to... Shhh... I've had a terrible experience. My health has broken down. I'm losing my strength. Oh, I'm so glad you were able to come before it's too late. I feel if I can only tell you the truth, I don't care what happens. Of whom are you afraid? I'll tell you everything presently. They won't interfere while you're here. What have you done with the key I sent you? Someone is looking after it for me. Well, I hope it's someone you can trust. That key is worth a fortune to certain people. I kept it in that old Bible there. For 10 years Miss Lansdowne, something has haunted me, tortured my conscience. I was forced into a terrible crime, something concerning the door with the seven locks. The door with the seven locks? Just guard the key I sent you. They will try to get it from you. That door conceals the crime. But where are the other keys? They're with... Mr. Silva, Mr. Silva, Mr. Silva. Help! Mr. Silva. Oh my God! Oh please. I'm the matron. What it is you want? He's dead, Silva in there. He's been shot. Silva? I don't understand. May I ask how you got in here? In room number seven, just now he's been killed, here. This room you say? Yes. You are quite sure? Yeah. The picture, quite sure and the books. You must have a remarkable imagination, Miss... But I saw him. Do you realize what extraordinary things you're saying. Who are you? But it's the truth. He was lying dead in that bed. Who was lying dead? Mr. Silva, the man I came to see. You must be dreaming. Oh no. You see, I got a letter from him this morning. Oh, have you got it with you? Yes. Yes, this seems genuine enough, that only adds to the mystery. You see, there are no patients here. Unfortunately, this nursing home has been a failure. I'm closing it down today. There's no one here but myself. But this is preposterous... I quite agree. Look, a man showed me into this room. I'm beginning to think you must be a mental case. I think in your own interests, you ought to see a doctor. I should go to the police. Scotland Yard. And when that terrible woman suggested I was mad I just ran. What could I do? Or did I dream that all? Shall I stick a pin in you? Supposing the police don't believe me. Where do you say we were going? Scotland Yard. Well, let's see. What do I know about Scotsmen? Strong and silent, aren't they? Now, I like my men weak and talkative and if they talk they sometimes say things they're sorry for. So I got my diamond. I hope you'd reconsider your decision, Martin. I am sorry sir. Why don't you give your Aunt's legacy to the police orphanage and go back to your office? You see sir, I've decided to... Travel? Yes, sir. To improve my ideas. Oh, a tip, don't lecture and don't write reminiscences. Nobody wants to hear them or read them. Off you go. Good luck. Thank you, sir. Hey, wake up you dope. I was concentrating. You call me sir, be respectful to your superior. Superior, my foot. I've resigned. I'm a free man Andy, but you're just a small time copper with a large liver. Oh yes. You're plain lazy because you're too fat and you're too fat because you're plain lazy. It's a vicious circle. Well, never mind now on it won't worry me. You're going to buy a country house and be a gent, eh? Ride to hounds and take duchesses out to dinner, what a life for a grown man. Oh stop it, Andy. I'm beginning to weaken already don't make it any worse, otherwise I'll stay here and cheat you out of promotion. I can see the whole picture. A fool and his money, a blonde and her mother and another poor sap ends up broke, beaten and bewildered. No Andy. No woman is going to ruin my life until I'm too old to resist. Women are like tiger cats. They ought to be caged at 16 and shot at 20. Come in. Young lady to see you sir. She says it's urgent. Tell her the last property owner is over the river. She says its murder sir. Somebody has poisoned her cat. Bring her in. Oh well, before the old trump starts telling her boring story, I'll vamoose. Goodbye Andy. Remember me at Christmas. Miss June, sir. Inspector Sneed? Yes. No, no he is. I was told to ask for Inspector Sneed. I'm Inspector Sneed. What can I do for you ladies? Look, I've just seen how... I've had a terrible experience. A man has been murdered. Where? By whom? Mr. Martin, I'll take charge of this matter. Sure, but I'll help. Now ladies, tell me all about it. Well, about half an hour ago I went to a hospital here. Were you expecting the note from this man Silva, the one with a key? No. It was a complete surprise. I thought it was from a band conductor who's trying to get off with me the way they all do but... Do you mind leaving this matter to us? Sorry, I was only trying to help. Get me Morris. Yes. You're quite sure he was shot? He must have been. I saw him clutch at his chest when the bullet struck him. There was no report? No. Well, I heard a sort of a dull plop. Silencer. I want you to come up right away. Tell a squad car to standby. I'm glad I didn't go in. I just hate to see a man wasted like that. There aren't enough to go around as it is. Sorry. Go to the Northgate Nursing Home Earl's Court right away. Make a complete search. It looks like a murder job and you'd better be armed. Inspector, if you're not wanting Miss Lansdowne right now I'll go to the flat and inspect that key. You'll go, but you resigned? Yes, I know but I'd like to help unofficially. You see, I resigned my job this morning but we needn't worry about that. Now will you accept my services as advisor and friend? Well I'm... I might be useful, it's entirely free. Consider yourself engaged, with thanks. Andy, from now on I'm Miss Lansdowne's guide, philosopher and friend. To see that she gets a square deal from the double-crossing police. I may need a little advice too. My mother didn't tell me a thing. Yeah, bless you. That's what they told me. For Pete's sake, let's have some light. That's better. Gosh, these London fogs give you the heebie-jeebies, don't they? Shhh... Londoners love their fog. Say, that roommate of yours, what's his name? Andy Sneed. He doesn't seem to like women much does he? Was his mother ever frightened by one? Glenda likes them to fall easily. A burglar, in there. Is that a burglar? Let me go. Let me go. Help. Let me go. Help, help. Let me go. Quiet. Let me go. Burglar, burglar. Let me go. Help, help. Let me go. Quiet. Help. Listen. What is it now? Are you hurt? The key. The hall porter has it, I hope. It was the key that mattered. Why didn't you get it? Now, try to be brave my child. All right, do your worst. One man has already been killed for this and there may be more on the agenda. Now, there. Ouch. Glenda, have you got the brandy? Yes. I feel better for that. Well, you will survive, I'm afraid. Well, thanks for the good news. Have you got those letters Silva sent you? Oh I just remember. I showed the second letter to that matron, she never gave it back to me. But I've got the first one, in the bedroom. Hello? I'll keep the key meanwhile. There's your brandy. Good, that's one thing that's not going to hurt me. Yes, it's for you. Hello? Hello, Andy. Listen, the solicitor who looks after the Selford estate is Edward Havelock, Waterloo Place, W1. Perhaps your girlfriend would like to ask him a few questions, and let me have the answers. Yeah. I'll go and find out the answers myself. Good health. That burglar was the messiest guy. It's gone. The letter? I hid it this morning. It's certainly a conspiracy to wipe out all traces of Silva's existence. I'm afraid this adventure may land you in considerable danger. When I was 15, I spun a coin. Tails, home girl, cooking and knitting. Heads, adventure. Heads won. And so Mr. Havelock, I suggested Miss Lansdowne should come and see you. Miss Lansdowne, I've been trying to get in touch with you for years. But you see, my parents died when I was very young. I was brought up by French-Canadians in Quebec. I never knew I was connected with the Selford family. The last of the line is the present Lord Selford. He was 11 when his father died. I tried to become a father to him when my own son died some years ago. I hope that John Selford would take his place but... Oh he's the most elusive young man in the world, he never spends more than a few days together in one place. At present, I believe he's in Buenos Aires. I look after his latest communication. Bring me the Selford file for November. I suppose the Selford's have got a family place here. Yes. Selford Manor, a quiet old place in the heart of the country. The house is left now to an old friend of the late Lord Selford lived, should you wish to visit it, I'm sure that he would give you every assistance. Does this mean anything to you? Yes. Looks like one of the seven keys of the Selford tomb. Cross, bring the Selford keys. Keys sir? I haven't handled those twice in 10 years. Yes, yes Grayson will show you, now hurry up. When Lord Selford died, he was buried in the tomb with seven locks. I hold all the keys. Where did you get this? The man Silva gave it to me. Can't be a genuine Selford key. After what you've heard about Silva's murder, can you think of anyone who would want it so badly? A genuine or not. No. It baffles me. You sure it's the right one? Can't you read? Not by day, I went to a night school. I heard it over the radio last week. But in the mean time I'll do everything I can for you Miss Lansdowne. Everybody seems to be helping me. The box is empty sir. What? Look sir. Who's responsible for them? Well they were in the care of my chief clerk, Foster who retired two years ago. When he left, he handed them over to Grayson here. Did you check everything? Well... Or did you take Foster's word? Yes Mr. Havelock, you see we were very rushed. Now the estate will hold you personally responsible. This is a very serious matter I shall report it to the police. Was Foster trustworthy? Well absolutely. He came on the most excellent recommendations. You say you held all the keys. Yes seven, I thought they were in that box. This is a terrible matter, Mr. Martin. I, I have betrayed my trust. Do you think Foster could have taken them? I don't, why should he? Yes. Well, it depends on his moral character. Excuse me. Was there anything of value in the tomb? The Selford jewels. What's that rumbling noise? Have we got a flat tire? No, it's only Glenda snoring. So you better have a look at that map. Well, it says turn left beyond the three feathers. Then straight on, and then turn to the right and that should lead us straight to Selford Manor. Oh we're on the right road anyway. There's something in the middle there. Well, what do we do now? Better try this one. Righto. I feel a little sleepy. Do you mind if I just go ahead. That was close. Oh, it was hot. I wonder who thought that one up. Have I missed something? Welcome to the ancestral home. But no red carpet, no flowers. Yeah. What do they think we are? You're late. I was getting worried about you. Yeah. We took the wrong turning. Miss Baker, this is Mr. Havelock, the lawyer and trustee of the Selford Estate. I'm delighted to meet you, Miss Baker. I hope you didn't mind my crashing the party. I thought these two might need company. Isn't this a lovely old place, Glenda. Now what do you like best? The fire. Now I am in love with that. Our host will appreciate your love of flowers, Miss Lansdowne. Ah, here he is. Doctor Dr.Manetta, let me introduce Miss Lansdowne, Miss Baker and Mr. Martin. Welcome my friends. This is a great day for me. I cannot remember when last I entertained. I live here almost like a hermit. Well, I hope our cook has not forgotten how to prepare a good dinner. She has been so long without practice. Cawler... Yes sir? Take the bags upstairs. The house keeper will tell you where everything goes. Miss Lansdowne has been admiring your azaleas. So you like flowers? Adore them but don't all women? A beautiful women and beautiful flowers have much in common. Their purpose is to brighten an otherwise dreary world. Well, as soon as you have seen your rooms and changed, I will have cocktails ready for you. Well, if you're fixing them in the surgery doc, make mine an arsenic straight. You are an American, huh? No. I'm from Ontario. June is from Quebec. French-Canadian? Sort of, by adoption. I was in Canada once. There was a revolution in my country and my sympathies being anti-rebel, I repaired to a country where they would not worry about my politics. I'll take those. Just stick around. I want a private talk with you presently. I am more perturbed than ever. Dinner will be ready in half an hour, my cook is a stickler for punctuality. Tell me my man... Excuse me, please. Craig, I am afraid is dumb. Is there anything I can do for you? No thanks. Craig was the unfortunate victim of rebel atrocities. He lost his tongue. Is that so? What did you say? What was it you wanted to talk me about? I've been down to the tomb, and as far as I can tell nothing has been disturbed. But at any rate everything is still locked and Dr.Manetta says that he's sure that nobody has been near it in ages, but I'm very uneasy. Which room did you say? Oh. Do you think he was listening? I don't know. But you see, Foster the clerk, who had charge of the keys was recommended by Dr.Manetta. My main recreation, well, music upon what I would do with my spare time if I had any. My patients are poor but numerous but they are quite unique. They always pay their accounts promptly. Dr.Manetta has a great reputation which extends far beyond the county borders. It's lucky that his patients are honest, because he never send them any bills. No, no, there you are wrong my friend. Even a country doctor must live. Money means nothing to me but it seems to be an obsession with my trades' people. If I can manage a meal a day and two pairs of stockings, that's all I ask. Just as long as she's got a few fur coats on the side. Like myself you are a simple soul, I'm quite sure we are the happiest. Dr.Manetta has quite a number of visitors who are not patients. They come to see his weird collection. What do you collect doctor? Instruments of torture. Is Mr. Havelock joking? Oh no, no, no. I think I ought to explain that my interest is purely antiquarian, although perhaps I have a slight personal interest. Oh, what is that? I am Spanish by decent. My family claim as one of their ancestors, the famous or perhaps I should say the infamous Tomás de Torquemada. Now what do I know about him? Wasn't he the Grand Inquisitor? Correct. He reduced torture to a fine art. Barbarism. It served its purpose. You're surely not attempting to justify its use? Why not? Be careful Martin, it's a trap. He's only arguing for the sake of argument. Nevertheless, I'd like to hear the case for torture. It is based on the principle that only the guilty had anything to confess. Yes, but that's basically unsound. There is such a thing you know as a false confession. True, you have discovered the fall in the argument. Frequently, the innocent confess to sins of which they were not guilty, while many a true heretics suffered martyrdom in silence. Well I'm glad we're living in a more enlightened age. I wonder if we are. Tomorrow you must visit my little collection. It is a queer collection, both ancient and modern. Does it include a dentist drill? Shall we take coffee in the hall? Why doesn't your client ever come home to this lovely place? I'm afraid I can't answer that question, except by suggesting that he is a crazy young man with more money than sense. Tombs and torture chambers, don't they have any simple pastimes in this place? Maybe we can get the doctor to stage us a little public execution. Oh this is so peaceful. I could stay here for a hundred years, couldn't you June? Oh so that's the way it is huh? Well the storm is over and the moon is up. Oh bravo, you must be a genius to conjure music out of that old crock. Well if the moon is up, what about looking at the tomb? I couldn't think of a more romantic idea. I understood that you all wish to visit the tomb. Not me. If I go calling on corpses, I generally pick a sunny day for it. Oh please forgive me but I just remembered that I have to visit a patient. So I shall not be able to accompany you to the tomb. Havelock will show you the way, I'm overdue already. I shall be waiting to join you in a game of baccarat when you return. Excuse me. Oh eh Bepo. I don't like any of this business. I wish I was out of it. Well, they've arrived. We saw them. What do you want us for? The girl went to see Havelock. He discovered he had lost the Selford keys. Mr. Martin was interested. What about it? What does he know anyway? Oh nothing very much but he's an inquisitive young man. He may prove a nuisance to us. What do we got to worry about? He can't do anything about Silva until he has a body to prove it. And he can't open the tomb without the keys. Anyway, the girl isn't a beneficiary as long as young John is alive. Just the same for your own safety. You must get back the key. There's another matter to discuss. Our share also is overdue. Oh don't you worry about that, you'll get the money. Meanwhile we have six keys between us. And the girl has the seventh. And the girl has the seventh. But we must be gentle with her, she plays she plays Chopin divinely, eh Bepo. You've been there before, haven't you Mr. Havelock? Yes, I was there this afternoon. You sure you won't come to the tomb Miss Baker? No thanks. If want any jitters, I'll get them out of a bottle. I believe your old family buried themselves in grand style. Yes, when the death duties allow. Could I please have a gin and jitter... I mean a gin, oh I'm terribly sorry. Is it far? No, to the left of the mill house where the doctor keeps his torture gadgets. He's a queer chap Dr.Manetta. I think he's rather jolly. Yes, so was Briggs the poisoner. Here we are, cheerful place isn't it? Hello. It's open. That's strange. I'm sure it was closed when I was here this afternoon. Self-locking? Turn your torch down here a moment will you? - Where? - Here. Tire marks. Has any large car or van been around here recently? Well, I think it is very improbable. Cawler, the one could have come to the cottage. I'm going back to the house. Come on let's go inside. I don't understand those marks. Something queer is going on here. Well, I can think of nicer ways to spend the evening. Some nightclubs are not much better. There have been people here recently. A woman among them. But the gate is always kept locked. We found it opened. True, and I can't explain that. Where's this door with the seven locks? Down here at the end. Now there's one thing certain this door hasn't been open for several years. Lend me your stick a moment, Mr. Havelock. Was not Selford afraid, someone might wake him up? I have explained to you that he had the family jewels put in there with him. Don't ask me why, his will dictates that they're to be given to John's bride on her wedding day. If the keys hadn't been stolen, how many would we have had? Seven, with Miss Lansdowne's. Well, with your permission, I'd like to try this one. Certainly you can do. If your family heirlooms have been stolen then it's a matter for the police. Ah that's the one. It's a spring lock. Well, even if they haven't, I've no right to probe in there and as perspective heiress Miss Lansdowne, what are your wishes? Silva knew something about that tomb that caused his death. I'd hate to disturb the family ghosts but I should like to know what it was. I think it would be wise to dump your responsibilities on the public pristine. It's not too late to do it now? From what I've seen and heard, I actually advise it. Oh, it's locked? How did that happen? Perhaps it's the wind. No, it couldn't possibly have been that. I told you it is self-locking or only the lock's the other side. Well, try again. It's no good. It's locked alright. Here's the key. Well, if we're going to stay here all night, I need a toothbrush. You're not scared, are you? Frankly, I am. I feel sure that some malignant forces are working against us. A shot, wasn't it? I bet it was. I love frolicking in morgues. What are you doing? A man went through the trees, into the bushes. I wonder where his bullet went. I think it'll tell us who killed Silva and a lot of other things we want to know. Struck over here, I heard it. Look. Bepo, you're Bepo. You know, you're Dr.Manetta's little monkey, come on and fetch that key, oh come along. Come here Bepo. Come along. Come along, there's a good monkey, come along. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the fellow. Bepo, Bepo, Bepo, Bepo. I've looked all around sir. But he was on my shoulder until he jumped into the bushes? Well, don't stand and gape, go and find him. Bepo, Bepo. Well sweetie, I think we owe you quite a lot. Mr. Martin, murder has been attempted. What do you propose to do about it as a police officer? I am a private citizen Mr. Havelock and as such I prefer to do precisely nothing. What? The key is stolen and murder attempted and you propose to do nothing at all? Only for tonight, tomorrow I may do quite a lot. But we may never see tomorrow. No Mr. Havelock, don't spoil my lovely evening. Bepo. Bepo, Bepo, Bepo. Is he the deaf and dumb one? No, no, no, he is just my little monkey. A lonely man's only friend. But he is somewhere, he was on my shoulder and then he jumped into the bushes. Glenda, we got locked into the tomb. A mere accident. We lost the key and your little monkey found it for us. Yes, he's very clever. But he has his stupid moments. Yeah. Someday when my patients either desert me or die, I am thinking of opening my little collection to the public. After what happened last night, I can't help feeling that our presence here is far from welcome. Havelock seems to think that Dr.Manetta is in some scheme to rob the tomb. For the jewels? Yes. But you know, I'm beginning to believe, that there's more in this business than just a mere theft of a few family heirlooms. Do you suspect Dr.Manetta? On fact, no. On his looks, why not? Well, here we are. Will you get a load of this. Now, that is a collection of poisoned drinking cups. This one belonged to Lucrezia Borgia. You will have to take my word for it. Come here. Those leg shackles are 18th century. And what's that? This was called the Vagrant's mask. It was fitted over the victim's head. This part was pressed against the eye and it was screwed up tightly. I leave the rest to your imagination. Sweet little collection, isn't it? Yes. I think I'm going to stick to cigarette pictures. What's the stage show for? A page of history. Not Magna Carta? No. It is the Inquisition in session. It is reconstructed from an incident in which my own family took part, not as the victims. I also have a choice collection of branding irons. Yes. We could do with some of those at the yard. Some people are most reluctant to talk. For that, I recommend this. The iron maiden of Toledo, a great favorite of Ferdinand of Castile, she was the Queen of terrors in 1484, an original preserved for over 400 years. She looks quite charming. Yes. I always distrust charming women on principle. Oh, you are so right. Let me show you something. Would you like to play the part of the victim? All right, yeah. The iron maiden was no angel, I assure you. And if the victim hadn't confessed by the time the knives descended, he kept his secret for good. And there will be no collection. That'd be a swell thing for making backward guys propose. They showed great imagination. Don't you agree? I smell coffee. Glenda, aren't you going to join us? No, the Doctor is showing me. Oh. Craig looks like as he's been in the wars. What do you mean? Did you see the new bandage on his wrist? No. I've seen something odd in that place. Odd, I could think of a better word. No, no, I mean something that's struck me particularly as being odd. Did I ever tell about that picture in Silva's room, in the nursing home? No. I didn't realize at that time what it represented. But now I know what it was? It was the picture of a Spanish priest in Inquisitor and I've just seen it in that old mill or an exact copy. Well, that's funny because it certainly wasn't in the nursing home when Sneed searched the place. Dr.Manetta, must've been connected with that nursing home? And it was he that recommended the clerk Foster to Havelock. Do you think it's possible that Dr.Manetta murdered the heir? It's an idea. And Craig's bandage, did you mean it was he you shot at? It could have been but who's going to tell us, he can't? Hello, telegram, who for? Martin, all right, yes I'm ready. Yeah. Right, I'll read it back to you. Can you come here today? Discuss cases, friend have some news for you, regards Andy, received 11:15 AM, that's right, thank you. Havelock's coming to town with me. I'll be back in the morning. You know, I hate leaving you. No, we'll be all right. This isn't the Victorian age, you know. No, you get me wrong. I mean, I don't like leaving you. Oh, You'll be back in the morning. Yes, and when I do come back, I may have something to tell you. Can't you tell me now? No, time and place is all wrong. It can't be very important. Well, yes it is. It's the most important thing of all. Are you ready Martin? Yes, coming. You'll take care of yourself, won't you? I told you, I love adventure. Yes, I'm beginning to wish cooking had won, when you tossed that coin. Those letters of John Selford's, can I see them? Yes, I'll drop off at my office and bring them over. I hope you're right about Dr.Manetta. I'm sure, I am. If Dr.Manetta's in this he won't dare come out into the open, so we need not worry about Miss Lansdowne or her friend. June's all right, she can take care of herself. Well? Dr.Manetta, and the Cody's are in some racket together. They bumped Silva and disposed of the body. In a plain van. In a what? I was just coming to that, a woman who lives opposite the nursing home notices a plain van outside the place on the night the Lansdowne girl was there. Why the devil didn't you tell me that before? You didn't ask me. Listen Andy, I was down at the Selford vault last night and in the mud outside, there were tire marks of a large car, a van probably. The van your Mrs what's it saw. Andy, the solution of Silva's disappearance is in that tomb. Probably. Now listen, June and Havelock were with me. Somebody locked us in that tomb and started a shooting match. I found the slug, I've got it here. Let's see. I should say that it had been fired through a 38 auto. I'll get the expert to check out. Come in. Mr. Havelock sir. You've been very quick. Yes, I don't want to waste time. This affair is getting on my nerves. This is Inspector Sneed. How'd you do? You'll have to excuse him. He's never conscious till after launch. I have brought the Selford letters, but just a few of the more recent ones. Well, that's fine. You're certain the letters were from John Selford? Positive, though I've not seen him for some time. I know his handwriting. When did you last see him? About four years ago. He hasn't been home since? No, not to my knowledge. But doesn't that strike you as being a bit odd? Yes, but then I know his idiosyncrasies. I-D-I-O-S-Y-N-C-R-A-C-I-E-S. Yes, Mr. Havelock? You must realize Martin that I have no right to prevent a man of 21 from seeing the world on his own money. Besides as I've told you his health isn't at all good. He needs sunshine. What's wrong with him? Paralysis of the right hand. P-A-R-A... I know, I know, so he's left handed? Completely. Have you come to any conclusions? We have certain theories. I hope you'll get the matter straightened out. It's most worrying. If there's any way that I can help you, I... Well, if you will let us do the worrying. In the meantime, will you look after this key for me? Well I'd much rather not have the responsibility. I wish you would, sir. Inspector Sneed and I are returning to Selford in the morning and I think it will be safe in your keeping. Are you expecting trouble? Why you will never know. Well, I shall be at my office if you want me. Good morning, inspector. He's worn out. He's been awake all the morning. What's the matter with you, concentrating again? Selford's left-handed, that ought to help. What about these letters? I'll have them sent down to the handwriting expert. I'll take them down there myself. I suppose he is still at Dolphin street. Yes, D-O-L-F-I-N. The writer of this was a young man of 30 to 35. Anything else? Yes. The paper was manufactured in England, but a lot of it finds its way abroad. One thing more. Which hand were they written with? The right. The right. Listen Andy, I'm onto something big, those letters were written with a right hand and John Selford's right hand is paralyzed. You have to miss your beauty sleep, you're coming down to Selford with me tonight. Good night's sleep? I should say not, I've been working hard. Look. Miles too big, it'll never fit Harry. I've changed my mind. I'm making it for somebody else. Who? Cornelius, you know, that nice detective friend of Dick's. For Pete's sake, what's happening? Look, look Bepo has got it. Hey monk, come down here. Oh look at him now. Bepo, come down here at once. Bepo, come down here. Come on now Bepo, come to Auntie. Be careful. Talk about the bull in the China shop, Bepo, come down Bepo. Bepo, come down here at once. If he doesn't stop soon there won't be a jumper for Cornelius. Oh look at him now. Hey Monk, come down here. Or perhaps he doesn't understand English, be careful. Look. I've seen it before. No, not this one. Well, then let's get this straight, you had a key. I gave it to Dick. So what? This maybe one of those stolen from Havelock. You mean the doctor pinched them? Well, he may know who did. Why should he be mixed up in it? For half a million pound of the Selford jewels maybe. I'm going to telephone Dick. There's a phone. No, not from here. I'm suspicious of everybody now. But Dick said he'd be back in the morning. I want to tell him right away. I'm going to phone from the village. I guess I'll make him a pair of socks instead. Well, what did she find? Salt. What's up? Bepo unearthed one of the keys. The girl has it. Craig saw it in her hand. You must get it back, where is she? I saw her going towards the road. It looks as if she was off to the village. Let us too, we don't want any trouble here. You must get the car out and follow her. She mustn't reach the village. Take her to the Cody's you understand? My job's writing, not kidnapping. I advise you not to argue. It frays my nerves. Bring her in here. She had a knock on the head. I'll attend to her. The girl is here. Give me drink, will you? The matron. I'd rest if I were you. My head. I'll get you a sedative. Why am I here? You had an accident. You've been unfortunate again. Wait. How is she, all right? Yeah, she feel's thirsty, so do you evidently. I'm going to get her a sedative. Did you get the key? Yes. Well, let's have it. I got to get it back. The governor will be waiting. He's not getting it. But why not? What's the idea? Come on hand it over. Take it easy. Dr.Manetta owes us money, is that right Bevan? Yes. Our share is overdue. We should've had it three weeks ago. We'll hold this and the girl till he comes across. You can't do it. The girl will be reported missing and the cops'll cover this place like an epidemic. That is up to Dr.Manetta. If he moves fast, he can save us all a lot of unpleasantness. Call him up. Kidnapping, blackmail. What's going to happen next? Tell him to come over. With the money. Hello, is that you Doctor? Yes, this is Dr.Manetta speaking. How is the patient? Patient? Don't you understand Doctor? This is Cody, Dr.Manetta, we've got the key but we're keeping it till we get to our split. I will come and see the patient at once. One of my patients is very, very ill. I'm afraid I shall have to leave you. Oh, just as we were beginning to get acquainted too. That is one of the drawbacks of my profession. Excuse me please. It's my guess that John Selford has been murdered or he is being held captive by Dr.Manetta and company. Someone, probably Cody is cashing the checks abroad. Dr.Manetta is managing the forging business from this end and sending the letters to Cody, so that he can post them to Havelock, ...see. I heard you. Well, we'll see what the tomb uncovers. Well, how'd you like it? Well, not crazy about it. What, are you nervous? I'll let you know if I want you to hold my hand. Plenty of them. Yes, there's quite a few generations boxed up here. Say, this one looks interesting. Give me a hand, Andy. Finger marks, this thing has been tampered with recently. Here, hold the torch, Andy. Huh, they did the job in a hurry. Screws are loose. The torch, Andy. Silva. Yes. From the descriptions June gave me. Fits the one we've got at the yard too. Andy, we've got enough evidence to pin this on Dr.Manetta. I doubt it. Where's your motive? Silva had to be silenced. He sent for June to tell her what happened to John Selford but he was shot before he could speak, there's your motive. Right. Better question Dr.Manetta. No, Andy. I want you to hold your hand. There's still a lot in this business we know nothing about. Is that the door? Yes. That's where the real mystery lies. Come on let's go. I'll be glad too. This place will keep me awake tonight. Hello, Glenda. Where's everybody? Thanks heavens you're here at last. I'm scared stiff. Well, don't worry, here's Cornelius, to comfort you. Where's June? She went out to phone you. She found another one of those keys and she didn't want a phone from here so she went to the village. Is Dr.Manetta in? No, he went out awhile back to visit one of his patients. That dumb servant is gone too. Gee, am I glad to see you two. Does Dr.Manetta know that June's got that key? I don't know. There's your girlfriend. Don't get vulgar and take your hat off. Hello, who? Oh Mr. Havelock. Yes, Martin here. Well look here Martin. I'm at my office and a letter arrived this morning from Lord Selford. What? Another one? In the same handwriting? Yeah, and he's on his way to Selford Manor. He's back in England? He'll be there at about eight o'clock. Its 20 minutes. Uh-huh, and I'm coming down in the morning. But. Hello? Oh, nothing. Goodbye. Did he say Selford was turning up. Yes, about eight o'clock. Love after all, huh? Yeah, so it seems, gosh, I feel like a man who's been walking in one direction and, and suddenly finds himself going in the other. Ever experienced it? Walking? Not me. And I got everything you said. Forged letters, business of Cody abroad, changing of the checks, everything, and now Selford has got to turn up and explain it all. There's one thing you will never be able to explain. And what's that? The murder of Silva, that's one for Dr.Manetta. Yeah, well that's busted now because there's no motive. Can't we wrong? Can't be. Well, while you're arguing on the finer points of justice, how about June? I'm going to wait until Selford arrives and if he hasn't turned up by then, I'll go down to the village and look for her. Is she awake? No. She must have had a heavy blow. Concussion probably. What's the game? That will scare me. Dr.Manetta? Well go on, let him in. I am sorry to have kept you waiting but when I received your pressing invitation my car was not available, well, I hope you have decided to adopt to a more reasonable attitude? Where's the money? My dear Cody did you imagine I'd carry a sum like that in loose cash? When do we get it? Shall we say tomorrow? All right, but no later. That's better. I knew you would be sensible about it Ann. Cawler, open that window, it is like an oven in here and now may I trouble you for the key? Oh no, tomorrow, in return for the money. I must have it at once. What's the hurry? We are opening the tomb tonight. You'll what? And I shall also require the other two keys in your possession. We had the right to be consulted of any change of plan. There's no time, the police know too much already. Unless we move quickly, they will ferret out the whole story. You're bluffing. The police won't find out the truth unless they open the tomb and they'll need dynamite to do that. No Dr.Manetta, we'll keep the keys. Really Anne and you're being as stupid as your husband. Get out. Do you want to wake the girl? You refuse to give up the keys? Until we are paid? Yes, then we'll return yours. We're not parting with ours, they're too good a security. You're both being very unwise. No, stop. You'll never get away with this, Dr.Manetta. Pull yourself together you fool. Get the keys. I'll have yours too. Take the blasted thing. I'm through with the whole rotten business anyway. I'm getting out. That is where you are mistaken. Drive to the vaults. Craig knows what to do when you get there. I'll follow in Cody's car. What about the girl? I'll look after her. Good evening. May I introduce myself, I'm John Selford. Doctor Dr.Manetta is expecting me. Oh, yes, of course. My name is Martin. I'm a friend of the Doctor's. How do you do? I'm afraid the doctor is not expecting you here this evening. But I wrote to Havelock, my solicitor. Oh yes, I know. Unfortunately the doctor was out when Mr. Havelock called and I took the message myself. Then he'll be very surprised when he sees me here. It's many years since I have been home. Yes, I wonder you spent so much of your time abroad when you got such a lovely place as this? I'm afraid I have to, doctor's orders you know. Oh Glenda, this is Lord Selford. Hi there. Hi and how do you do? This is my friend Cornelius Sneed. How do you do? I travel a lot. You see, I'm debarred from most of the social activities of the country. My arm makes things a little difficult. Yes, you must find it a great handicap. Oh one gets used to it. We spend quite a time admiring your beautiful possessions. Yes, they must have cost a packet. Some very fine pieces of porcelain. That... that vase for instance. Well my father was a very ardent collector but that I imagine belongs to Dr.Manetta. I don't ever remember seeing it before. Exquisite piece, don't you think so Cornelius? Yes, Chinese I should think. Yes probably about Ming. No much earlier than that. No, no, no Ming. Now look at the markings. Yeah there's no proof, it was the design that matters. Design my foot. What do you say Lord Selford? Well I haven't seen it yet. Oh no of course not. Here catch. What the devil does this mean? Well caught Lord Selford. Why? If he's Lord Selford, I'm Mary Queen of Scots. Good work Martin. Take these things off. Not until you explain how that paralyzed arm of yours came to life so suddenly. The first time I meet a real lord, he turns out to be a phony. Don't you give me the horse laugh you ape? Hello, yeah hello, give me the nearest police station. Dick how about June? As soon as the police arrive, I'm going to organize a search. Do you think that... I don't want to think. Hi, stop. I say, please stop. Hi, please stop. Thank you, I want to go to Selford Manor but I'm not quite sure which way. I'm very grateful to you, I lost my way. I said I lost my way. But fortunately I found you. Where's Dr.Manetta? Where's Miss... well, if my eyes don't deceive me that's a 38 auto remember Andy? Boy oh boy, now we're getting somewhere. Sit down. Sleeping peacefully. Look what I found Tom Cawler. You know him? Sure, he's one of the best pen men in the business. Forger, eh. Yes. There's the answer to your Selford letters. Where's Miss Lansdowne? Get off Andy I'll make him talk. Hey, none of your backroom methods. All right, I'll tell you everything. It will help me, won't it? It depends on what you got to say. Dr.Manetta has got the girl. She was at Cody's. I took her there. Where's that? About two miles away but they'd have left by now. Answer it Glenda, that will be the police. Go on, I'll keep an eye on the one armed wonder. Where was Dr.Manetta going? To the tomb, that's where you'll find him inspector, at the tomb. The tomb. Go ahead Dr.Manetta, I got you covered. Look out. Don't shoot. Self-defense. Havelock? The lawyer. That's one for the book. So he was in it too. I wonder what he came here for. To get this out of the tomb. I think this is going to tell us all we want to know. Looks like a death certificate. It is. Who's? Young John Selford's. Andy, he died when he was 11 years of age. Its 10 years ago. So this is the secret of the door with the seven locks. So you were right. And all that time Havelock and co were milking the estate and sending that young stooge abroad to collect the money. Incidentally, I wonder who he is. If you give me the light a moment. Look the names are all here Havelock, Cody's, Silva, Cawler, it's made out by Dr.Manetta. That's funny. I wonder why they all signed this certificate. That's what Dr.Manetta is going to tell us. Help, help. Better go and get your police to look after the body. I'm going after Dr.Manetta. I think I know where I can find him. Richard, Richard help, help, help, Richard, Richard. Good evening, doctor. I can save you the trouble of going to the tomb. You were going there weren't you? You seem to know a great deal about my movements. You'll be surprised just how much I have learned since your partner, Mr.Havelock opened the tomb. I congratulate you. Where's Miss Lansdowne? Oh no, no please Mister Martin, surely as a detective it is your job to find that out. That's exactly what I'm going to do. Let me out. With your own medicine Doctor Dr.Manetta. Let me out, let me out let me out. Where's Miss Lansdowne? Let me out and I'll tell you. Not until you tell me where she is. Let me out, let me out. Release me. Now. Let me out for God's sake let me out. Let me, let me out of here, let me out of... What the devil's going on here? What's it look like? What have you been up to? A bit of the third degree or something? Well he asked for it. Would you get me some water please? There is a tap in the corner. You know very well the police can't use those methods. I'm not in the police I resigned. Well Manneta, where's Miss Lansdowne? We're charging you with murder so you might have. Wait a minute let's make this official. Doctor Dr.Manetta, I arrest you on a charge of having been concerned with the late Edward Havelock in the murder of Edward Silva on or about... Let us take the usual warnings for grantage. So Havelock is dead. He was shot resisting arrest. A week forward, our friend Havelock but we made good use of him. Where's Miss Lansdowne? Let us take the facts in the order of their importance. I quite understand your anxiety Mister Martin. Tell me first what you discovered in the tomb. This. What's it mean? Our joint confession of guilt. John was murdered. No. John Selford died from natural causes. The people that signed that document were the only ones that knew of his death. They were well paid to hold their tongues. Why, Havelock? Havelock as executer of the estate provided the money but the whole scheme was mine. Why was the certificate put there? As an insurance against double dealing, also each member of the syndicate was given one of the seven keys. Here they are. I got them back from Havelock when the tomb was opened. We found the Silva's body in the vault. Yes and you will find the Cody's there too. A suitable place for the dead, don't you agree? Who were the Cody's? Small fry that had to be liquidated. Triple murder, eh? Well, the penalty for three is no greater than for one. Craig did the killings. He had quite a flare for it. The so called heir, is missing? Havelock's son. But he told me he was dead years ago. It was John Selflord who died from then on Havelock took his place, an impersonation he carried out very successfully. Until tonight. I see. Anymore questions gentlemen? Yes, what about the Selford jewels? Intact, too difficult to dispose of. Miss Lansdowne will inherit them also the remainder of the estate. I think she will find we've have left her enough to satisfy her few simple tastes and keep it Mister Martin as a memento, it was a poison cup that once belonged to, to the Stewarts and thus the liquid I have released has lost some of its potency. My presence here is a matter of seconds. Where is Miss Lansdowne? Where is she? I gave you the answer. Dr.Manetta. Too late. What do you mean, Andy? You heard what he said? He gave me the answer? Right. Well I'll be glad to see the bright lights again. Well, I guess this is one car ride I won't have to walk home from. Hey, wake up. You know, if you were a poor girl and deserving I'd marry you. I think so much of that offer. I'll give the money away to Glenda. Oh that's different. Oh. Careful. I thought you like living dangerously? Can't a lady change her mind?
