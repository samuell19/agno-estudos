...Presents a film based on a book by Bohumil Hrabal Larks on a String After "Victorious February" the working class finally took power and became the ruling class in the state. The remnants of the defeated classes were put to work so that they could atone for belonging to the former bourgeoisie through honest labour. "Why shouldn't we be glad when we are working for ourselves?" AND O VERTAKE You wanted to see where the production of steel starts. This is the place, the scrap heap. All that you can see here well be smelted down into high-grave steel. We'll make tractors out of this steel to plough our fields. We'll make more washing machines so you can wash your dirty overalls. These are our voluntary workers. Mostly of bourgeois origin. We'll also smelt them down. Into a new kind of people. This is a professor of philosophy, a former librarian in the capital of Prague who was sent to work in industry, for he refused to shred decadent bourgeois western literature. How are you, professor? - Fine, thank you. It is getting better in the spiritual sphere. - Now I'll introduce the others to you. This is a public prosecutor who is here because he maintained that the defendant had a right to defend himself. Mr persecutor's lucky that comrade prosecutor didn't charge him. This is... Hey, hey! This is Tiny, a former joiner. Patented... Patented... - Patented manufacture of wash-tubs. - Patented manufacture of wash-tubs. He satisfied his bourgeois lust by employing four workers. This is Jack-knife, a former barber. He is here because out five barbers, three had to go. Well, men, what about hygiene? Tiny, don't eat bread with hairs on it! D'you want to get malaria or leprosy? This is a saxophonist who is here because we abolished saxophones as bourgeois instruments. And this one here, this is Dairyman. We're really proud of him. He himself decide to close his dairy and volunteered to work for socialism. This is Pavel Hvezdar, a cock thrown out of a hotel because he didn't want to work on Saturdays for religious reasons. Here he also doesn't work on Saturdays and I'm giving his now the third reprimand of the trade unions. This men will not die a natural death... So these are our workers. A former philosopher, public prosecutor, barber, cook and a saxophonist. I'm the only one here who's a worker by origin. Doctor, come and join us. - I can't, they took my ladder away. Ok then, you'll discuss the February events so that the cinema audiences know that not only them but all decent people must closely follow the imperialist plays of capitalism with revulsion and disgust. Americans, jump into the sea! The PUSAN fortress will soon fall. - Pusan. And you'll say doubtingly: I wouldn't be so sure! - No way, I'm in the dog-house as it is. All I'll say is: Ami go home! - Excellent! This is a dialectic approach. And you, as the people's tribune, will shout indignantly: Watch out, imperialists, we'll pour our peaceful steel down your war-mongers throats! Hands off Korea! - Watch out, imperialist, we'll pour... - Our... ...our peaceful steel down your war-mongers throats. - Hands off... - Hands off Korea! - Off Korea! - Is that so? ...opened by the chairman of the cultural commission, one-fifteen this afternoon... End of announcement. Hey, wait! You can't do that! She's a prisoner. - It's all right. Everything's my responsibility here. You two hold your hands and pretend to look joyfully into each other's eyes. That's it. And there will be the following commentary about the two of you. We're doing all this for our future, for the future of our young new people who love each other, who raise families to have levelly children who will never again know war, suffering, but ever-lasting peace. Bend forward a little bit, that's right. And take this newspaper, hold it like this as if you were reading it... That's it, that's it. That'll be wonderful. OK, let's roll! Smile! - Honour to work! - Why not, if it's well paid. - Yes, great. Great! Silence, please, we're rolling! - How come you haven't loaded up any scrap? There's no scrap to smelt in the furnaces! - Camera! - Americans, jump into the sea, the Pusan fortress will soon fall! - Ami go home! - I say, how come you haven't loaded up any scrap since the morning?! - We're on strike! - What? - What did you say, Vaclav? - Let's get out of here! - We're not working until they send the person who's supposed to discussed the increased norms with us according to the rules! - Vaclav, the imperialists are closing in on us. We can't wait, we have to pour our peaceful steel into their war-mongers throats! - We all read the Party daily's editorial - Who said the norms should be raised? Who did he discuss it with? - The ministry of heavy industry. - Whose suggestion was it? - Ours, the trade unions. - But you didn't ask the opinion of those who should've been asked first! Are we just figures for your statistic or what? - No, of course not, I only did what was approved by the trade unions. - Go are you going back to work? - Only if the original norms are maintained. - OK. In that case, I have to report it to the management and the Trade Union Council. - Why are you treating us like this? Why d'you want to take money from my pocket? - Vaclav, you, an old Party member, and you talk to me like that? - I'm fed up with you! - But, Vaclav, I'm one of you, I'm a worker too! - So you should be able to understand this. You should've filmed that, you window-dressers! - Hands off the strike! Hands off each other! I haven't had such a good laugh for ages. Come on, girls, cut it out! Work is a matter of honour for you! They're defectors. - Penal Code, the law which came into effect on July, 12, 195O, No. 86, paragraph 95 - deserting the republic. He who leaves the territory of the Czechoslovak Republic without permission will be punished by imprisonment of between one and five years. The court say withdraw his citizenship. Suspended sentence is out of the question! Well? Come on! Cut it out! Did you wash hands? Don't go overboard! Now hear this! We'll play Polka for Jarmilka in Honour of the smelting team lead by Vomacka for their record-braking number of melt-downs. Nothing but record melt-downs. The other day they broke the record for the open-hearth furnaces. Fourteen melt-downs in twenty-four hours. But one roller told me that he'd put all innovators before the court because the rolling-mill rolls the steel from these famous fourteen melt-downs and half of the material will have to go back into the furnace as scrap. So, it's true "Well Begun is Half Done". But it is even more true what our grandfathers, used to say: "Haste Makes Waste!" What might they give us for going on strike? - I'm just thinking about it. They could enforce the Act on Peace Protection, the sentences are more severe. - But we are in the right! We have to keep ourselves fit! - You maybe, but not me, nor the others. Of course, if I were comrade prosecutor, I'd charge us and the others with a nice anti-stats conspiracy. Then I'd charge myself as intellectual instigator of the whole strike, the exacerbating circumstances for me being that I, as former Mr Prosecutor, I should've known better... - But we're all equal here! The members of the defeated classes just like the communists. We're all working here to make everyone's life better! - Even violators enter the kingdom. So you're getting married, are you? Get married then! - There exist the double-slap theory. If a worker slaps me, they may lock me up because I provoked him, but if I slap a worker, it's classed as grievous bodily harm, even if it's only a hero less slap. - That's great! But that's not allowed here in Kladno! - So don't get married then! - Not here, anyway! Honour to work! - Honour to work. It looks like I'm going to have to. - Really? So go and get married then! - But I'm afraid... - So don't get married then! Get up! Get up, men! There's a delegate here form the Trade Union Council. - He's as busy, but he still found the time to come and see us. - So go and get married then! - Look, comrades, I was sorry to hear that you don't agree with the demand that we should be brought nearer socialism. What would the author of Red Fire Over Kladno think of that if he knew? Yeah, what would he think? If you impose norms on us which you haven't discussed with us according to the rules?! The former Union President was not against us, was he? I was still a boy when he played the harmonica with my Dad and in the evenings he taught workers to put a up a fight. - On a harmonica? - Yeah, an accordion. He used to go with my father for a drink to the Secky pub. He's never been a phoney, comrade. - Comrade, you can't say things like that You just play into the hands of the aggressors. - As for that, comrade, I'd leave it to comrades Krosnar and Zapotocky. They taught us that it was the duty of those at the top to listen to those at the bottom. - But this is playing into the hands of the reactionaries! - See to it that the norms are raised the way it should be done! Tell the planners to come and see us and to negotiate with us. If you don't know the Party line, at least I do. Let's go for a beer, boys! No use talking to a secretary like that! - So don't get married then! - Here you are, our comrades here in Kladno are really tough. - Who's that man? - That's our Dairyman. We call him that because he voluntarily closed his and how he works here. He's our best worker, a loyal Party member, but unfortunately a hard-boiled Kladno man. What strange people you've got here! So get married then! Here's my wedding present. Thank you. Carry on, carry on! Come, go to work! AT YOUR OWN RISK It was such a nice wedding, I'll have to get married too. The bride was almost as lovely as you, well, to put it more precisely, this gypsy was as lovel as if she were from our family. And Angel looked smart too! I'll tell you, when a gipsy started dancing with his bride, the fat was in the fire, just as it should've been! He trampled on his violin. - Watch out! - Angel trampled on the gypsy's violin... If it were my wedding and some lout danced with my bride in front of my eyes, I'd set the house on fire as well, out of jealousy. I'd like to have a wedding like that. What would you like? - Lenka needs some writing paper. - What else? - And Elsa wants some chocolate. - But what do you want? Just from me? I have to go. WE AREN'T AFRAID TO WORK. WE'LL EXCEED OUR PLAN. How are you, doctor? - Well! Since they threw me out of my job, made me move out of my flat and nearly locked me up, I've been getting better al the time. Would you believe I even lost my rheumatism? - Why not send them a letter of thanks then? - I'd better not, but somehow it simplified my mental make-up. I used to travel by taxi, now I take the tram. I used to drink Dubonnet, now I drink Popovice bear. I used to go to my club, now I just go to the warming-rooms. Mankind has hardly changed for thousand of years. Go away! What would you like? Just from me? - Never to set a house on fire. - What else? - Nothing. I'm just glad you're here. You know, nowadays, I am interested in Dreaiser, Picasso and Chaplin, but I have to compare them with my landlady who every morning has to dress her three sleepy children and drag them to a creche. She spends the whole day axing cement and sand. And in the evening, she collects her children and taken them home. My landlady is worth more to me than The American Tragedy. Monsieur Verdeux and the Doves of Peace put together. When a man goes walking on a quiet summer night and the flickering light of the stars twinkles in the sky, one gradually becomes absorbed in a feeling of friendship and scorn for the world and eternity descends on you. With this universal silence of nature and calmese of mind, the covert cognitive might of the immortal spirit speaks out in exclusive language and indescribable notions. That was Emmanuel Kant! So what is cleanliness? - Cleanliness. - So show me your little mugs! Come here! Come on! Come on! You too! Come on! Is the wash-tub ready? - Yes. It's much better now, doctor, that Christian Europe is consolidating. - What Europe? What Christian? It's more Jewish than over before! - Christian! - No way! At one end, a Jew genius, Christ, at the other another Jew of genius, Marx. Two specialists in gross. And for good measure, so apart from Christ and Marx... Apart from Christ and Marx, the Jews took over art and medicine with Freud and in physics with Einstein. A quadrille of Jewish: Geniuses makes the world turn, eh? - What discovery! So Leiblitz, lmmanuel Kant, even Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas are the products, or the refuse, of the Jewish spirit, eh? - No way! I'm only saying what I'm terrified of. Correct. So you saying God speaks Hebrew and the official language in heaven in Hebrew? - No. Neither Hebrew nor Latin. - So now does our good Lord speak? How? - How? You are the gods! Christ says! So here he speaks Czech. And where is your good Lord? - Here, you oaf! He who feels at home in all places is worthy of God, he who is identical with all time, he is with God. He who made all creatures silent, was God's first-born son, as put by Master Eckerhart. - A Jew? - No. - So it is Christian after all! But the world will not just look on. Take Iran, it is going at it hammer and nail. - What d'you mean, Iran? You meant Iraq, didn't you? - Are you going to the cinema tonight, boys? It's as I said. Iran! - Christ, you must've heard Iraq. You must've heard Iraq! - No, no. I listened to Radio Free Europe. They said Iran! Look, it's true that there's no difference between twit and twerp, but a huge difference between Iran and Iraq. A guy climbed in and got six months for it. What? Only six months? I'd do it. You'd get six months for your lust which would qualify as mitigating circumstances. But me, if I got in there, I'd get ten years, for just feigning lust. Because all I'd want was to instigate the female prisoners for subversion! Iran! But you heard Iraq! Iraq! For his masterpiece, the Lord made the female body. There's plenty to entice man's hands and eyes. Iran, I say! It doesn't cost you anything just to raise your head and you'll see the sky. Mr Kant used to take walks in K?nigsberg and he wrote: Two things never fail to imbue me with respect, again and again, with increasing admiration and esteem. The starry sky above me and the moral code in me. What happens above destroys my dignity so I see myself as some beast. But the moral code infinitely adds to my worth, making me absolutely independent of the world of the senses. Yeah, hear, hear! This is men's glory! His head full of ideal, his feet stuck in shit! Victory is one big shit-house! PATENT MANUFACTURER OF TUBS Don't wake up the children! You reek of booze. Did you have a meeting? Wait, Venousek, come to Daddy, that's right. The children will be surprised. Daddy will give you a surprise. Keep still, Venousek! Raise your hands, Venousek! And open your little eyes! - Do you know who bought it for you? - My Daddy. - And now close your eyes, Venousek! - Do you know who bought it for you? - My Daddy. I've got new clothes, look! I'll buy something for you too. And you... I'll buy you a sailor's suit too. And you... I'll buy you everything. Because I'm your Daddy. It's true I take steel instead of patented wash-tubs, but every good Daddy likes buying things for his kiddies. Terezka! One, two, three! Here's the chocolate, cigarettes... Thanks. Is there really nothing you want? D'you want to hear my poem "How a Miner's Daughter Forgot Her Proletarian Origin and Succumbed to the Temptations of Eros?" Brilliant! Victoria aeterna! Blast! Come on, boys, stop shitting about! Since we lost Dairyman, we have to do his stuff as well! I'm responsible around here. Warden, do they have to carry that material that far? We're finished, can we help them? - Little Angel. - Guardian Angel. Please, warden, have we ever left you in it? - Go then. But only three of you! We've come to help you, let's make a chain. Why are you so sad? - I warmed up my fish 'a water and fell asleep. And they got boiled alive. You sell fish? He's got fish which need air. Otherwise they drown. Really. Is there really nothing you want? Take off your gloves. So you don't know? I've got and aquarium with little fish, some drown, some get boiled alive. Now I have problems with my flying fish. They are getting a little too friendly with the sparrows. They are so mischievous in the evening that they won't go back into their aquarium, they sit on the chandelier and I can't catch them. - Really? - Really. He has to catch them with a butterfly net. Warden, he's got something in his eye. Can I help him get it out? But I haven't got anything in my eye. You've got lovely eyes. But he doesn't only breed fish, but he also plays the bugle a band. Last month, his band played in a pub and there was a fight. Tiny hid under a table and kept egging them on. He kept shouting: Get going! And they'd start off again. When they found out who was shouting, that it was someone under the table, they dragged him out, kicked him in the bum and rubbed in pepper and salt. Come on! That's enough! I'll do it myself! I'll do it myself! I hope you don't want to have any more children! What d'you know about it? You're both too foolish for it! Why shouldn't I have any more children? You could, but think how they'd ridicule me at school. Wash your feet before you go to bed! I like you. You didn't let them shred my Schopenhauer. I'll read you my poem on Jaroslav Vrchlicky, OK? Yeah. There's no place where your poetic spirit has not reached in the pilgrimage of your life so gigantic. Your poems have immortalised all manner of eras so profoundly and thus, with the light of your words you have raised the consciousness of your surprised brothers. Today, they follow you to eternal glory even though the constant bustle is the reason why the false sheen of the moment dazzles us. But with every spring, the orchard blooms anew, from chaos the spirit emerges to create order. Nice. No! No! That's another six months for you! The good old days are draining away and you don't even know that. The era has crushed you and what are you doing about it? You're feeding the furnace with your class attributes... - The world won't put up with that, Eisenhower will pursue a policy of force. - Yeah, America will go to war because of you lathes and saws...! Yes, indeed...! You know what will become of you? Ingots. This era will smelt you down too. I can't wait to see businessmen in Paris sweeping the roads while the workers kick them in the butt. Good morning. Here's the chocolate for girls. - Thanks. - Is there really nothing you want? What about cigarettes? What about chocolate? What about, what about marrying me? And what about all those legions of whorea of our youthful days? You couldn't help feeling sorry for them. They worked in some department store, they had little money, they had to make some extra. It's the same with shop-girls today. Don't they have to make some extra money? Just got to a night-club. There are secretaries making extra money to help pay their share of the rent. Look, these days you take a girl somewhere and you just want to cry. You have to drink plonk with some bimbo who can't tell one and from the other. She can't play the piano, she can't talk or hold an animated conversation. Yeah, back then... The era will sweep you all away. So these, children, are you workers. Show me your hands! OK. The situation has worsened due to the imperialists who are using our reactionaries to their base ends. Just take a look at them, at those repugnant, imperialism-soaked faces. The Fascist beast never sleeps. Their stick their uncuts into our blossoming garden again and since they can't use weapons directly, they abuse these freaks for subversion, whom we stopped from defecting to their benefactors. Keep them at a distance, not like the one who managed to get in end make one in-mate pregnant. To bring another decadent soul poisoned with capitalism into the world! We're too kind. It seems that work disciplines is fading and fading. And how could it not. But what's more important, it's that man's fading. Not just abstract but real people are disappearing. - Comrade... - Just let the children hear it. Dairyman disappeared because he told the truth, he said that we would not accept the increase norms which no-one had discussed with us. In other words, I'm asking, never mind the discipline, but where has Dairyman disappeared? You bear the consequences yourself! Who is it? Come on, children! Listen, Vaclav... You'll get two years for disrupting work discipline. Maybe you'll get an extra if they qualify it as peace violation. And maybe you'll get five years for abating the enemy. Well, if that's the way it has to be, I'll go for it! - Is the wash-tub ready? - Yeah. Gentlemen, there's nothing more wonderful in the world then family life! When my time comes, I'll get married. I'll marry a beautiful girl and we'll have children straight away because, gentlemen, food, drink, sleep, bathing and love-making are the noblest acts that exist. Your hands are shaking. - I slept badly. - I know the feeling. You're stuck here and all the time you think about what going on at home. It was just the same with me at first. - I have nothing to complain about. - Only I couldn't stand it any longer one day... I left a chap half-done and rushed home. - And what happened? - Of course, I caught her at it. My hands shook like the devil. I couldn't shave people for six months. Wilful desertion of your post is punishable by demotion and suspension for five years. That just takes the biscuit! Wait, I'm responsible for it! I'm the representative of the foreman! If they see us like this, talking with defectors, there'll be so much trouble! Kudlo, you're a typical Czech. You get a position and suddenly think the sun shines out your arse! Please, I would like to know... Yes, what? Oh no. Yes, we would like to know... - ...well... - What then? We would like to know how Mr Zatopek ran yesterday. - It was a great race! - Yeah! - A national disaster. - Oh, and we were urging him on... - It was a wonderful race! At the start Schade and Pirie were leading, Chataway... Weddings should be before Easter. Ideally around the solstice. Couldn't we wait? Maybe there'll be an amnesty in May. - No. Best at the solstice! On March 21 the earth and the sun marry and we'll have our wedding in their honour. - That's right. - But I'll still be locked up. - It's just not possible. - Oh yes it is. Why shouldn't it be possible? I'll sort it out. The impossible is possible in our country. But after the eight lap, it was nerve-cracking. Zatopek broke away as only he can, but Mimoun took the lead and the damage was done... - So Zatopek lost? - And we really wanted him to win! Dear ladies, then that devil Zatopek sped in front and broke a new record. It's a good job we crossed our fingers for him! Yeah, but we were sad in the bus because we knew that we'd have to put in extra work in honour of Zatopek's victory. What's going on? He'll be passing by here. Move along now! Our state provides the family with material and spiritual support so that it can contribute to the building of socialism in peace and happiness. I ask you, Pavel Hvezdar, do you take this woman by prosy, your bride Jitka Hlavackova, of your own free will and do you know of any impediment to this union? - I take her for my wife. - Mrs Thimingova, you are here by proxy of Jitka Hlavacova takes this man, Pavel Hvezdar, willingly? - Yes. - Thus I consider and declare this union closed. As proof of this act, Mrs Thimingova, as Aunt of the bridegroom, place the wedding ring on the bridegroom's finger by proxy. Congratulations. Congratulations. - Congratulations. Congratulations. - Honour to work. - Honour to work. Miss Hlavacova, I inform you that since half past eleven, that's the last three hours, you've been married and your name now is Jitka Hvezdarova. Congratulations. Have you got the ring? Out! So I got married, Mum. - That's nice. And where's your bride? In the nick. That's nice. Mum, I'll make something nice for dinner. - That's nice. Blest it! Mum, we're having soup and faggots. Just how you like it. That's nice. Then beef with dumplings and mushroom sauce. That's nice. And then... Look! I'm being original today! That's nice. Jitka! Obey your husband, be faithful to him, long live the newly-weds! Husband and wife should support each other! To stick together! To bear and bring up children! Welcome. Wait, you may find this handy. Where, are you off to? - Well, I'm going to... - He's here, he's arrived. We're going to welcome him! Home of that! We're going to welcome him! PLEASURE IN WORK, PLEASURE IN LIFE - Hurrah! Beautiful! Beautiful! So many flowers! Beautiful! If only Bozena Nemcova had lived to see this! Or Smetana... Can you hear? I can hear what's missing here. Music. Where's the music got to? But a man can't live through music alone, he needs bread. And there will be bread! And there will be butter! And cream! And Fibich and Dvorak. But where is the music, young man? - Yes. Music too, but... ...we really want to know what happened to Dairyman. And where's the professor of philosophy? And where are the good days... - Yes, yes, yes. - ...when people respected and loved each other? Yes. What a nice person! Who is he? A prematurely wise person... Is the wash-tub ready? - Yeah. Hey, starting a new life again? You bastards! There you are, llonka. Our government looks after your sanitary needs. Instead of playing cards, what do I do in my free time? I look after the new man. And who is this new man? - I am. - There you are. Yes. What d'you mean, a new life? You look after the young ones and you don't care a jot about the old! Just have a look! Who's going to wash our Granny? That's work for the police. Mum, go and watch in front of the building! Llona, the great thing about new people is that they don't worry about some heaven, where there are some kind of angels, but rather about people! For us it's enough, that the angels on the earth are you and us! That's a nice rule, my friend! Where did you pick it up? - Here. Friends, we are now going to walk together. Together we will preach the gospel on hygiene! Our rule is love your neighbour. I had such a lovely wedding. They were just dragging the Zehun pond. And when we came back from the church, my bridegroom Pepik had disappeared. He came back two days later. All soaked, he'd been fishing. What about yours? He's beautiful as if he were from our family. But I still haven't got him home. I've been married for six months, three weeks out of the nick and he's still not home. - Why? He got two years. But in eighteen months he'll be back home again. Line up! One day we'll see where the truth is! - I married truth. - And where is your truth? - Here. With me always. Like Antheus I grew weak, but recovered when I touched the ground. - My truth could rest on my knees, my truth is like bread on our table. But it's no longer on the table. Boys, they stole the truth from us, the bastards! Where is the truth now? Fate bids me to refine my philosophy. Oh, people, I'm so happy. I was born, all that sorrow, all that wrath, all was burst in the fire which cleansed me. I'm happy. I've found myself.
