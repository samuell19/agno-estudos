- So you're a real doctor? - Definitely. That's my car. - So where are we going? - Don't you trust me? No. I don't trust anyone. You still haven't told me where we're going. What's you name again? Betty. - Élizabeth, right? - Betty! - Where are we going? - To dinner. Aren't you hungry? I dunno. You can drink too. You're all gray. Yes... Yes, I love gray. Trust me, we're going to a very special place. It's near Versailles. - You smoke nonstop. - Nonstop. - Two, three packs a day? - What's it to you? I couldn't care less. But I'm a doctor, remember? Yes, that's twice you've told me. Do you like rabbit stew? That's all there is on the menu tonight. Wednesdays, they serve cassoulet. Cassoulet. Yes, just cassoulet. That's right. Wednesday is cassoulet night. Unfortunately, cassoulet isn't to everyone's taste. Here we are. Come on. - It doesn't look so hot. - Actually, it's quite charming. How strange. - "The Hole"? - Yes, The Hole. The Hole... The Hole! To think these people eat meat every day... How are you, doctor? You're not listening! Yes, I am. - What was I saying? - That people who eat meat... Please excuse me. Another one? Is this your first time here? Yes. Known the doctor long? No. - Can I get you anything to eat? - Thanks, I'm not hungry. Make yourself at home. Here, everybody does. Sorry to leave you alone. - They gave us another drink. - Good. I'm still thirsty. Of course. Joseph, she'll have another. You have an itch? Me? In this very spot, right? - Yes, I suppose. - Under the skin. - It's crawling. - What is? Is it superficial or deep? Well? It's important. - They're different in nature. - What are you talking about? Worms, sweetie. "Worms"? You didn't know, did you? You have worms under your skin. All kinds of worms, dear Betty. Tiny ones, huge ones, active ones, sluggish ones. Along with a host of more insidious creatures. I'll show them to you. You'll know their nature. No, don't move. Watch how I track them down. Filthy critters! They torture us like hell! It's OK, I've done this before. - Leave her alone, doctor. - I'm just removing a worm. No, leave her alone. Come, I need a word with you. - Later on. She wants me... - No! This is very important. Afraid I'll hurt her? You know that... - Waiter! - Yes, ma'am? Gimme a drink. Why are they against me? - Waiter. - Yes, ma'am? Another? - No. Got any smokes? - I'll check. Mario will drive him home. May I? Did he scare you? Don't worry, he's charming. - Cheers. - Cheers. He's a junkie. He got up to get his fix. - Have you known him long? - No. His name's Bernard. He was a doctor in Versailles. I'm thirsty. You caught Alan's eye. He keeps gawking at you. That's his eighth scotch. He can keep gawking. Mario's back. - It's pouring out there. - Did you get him in bed? - Yes, his wife gave me a hand. - He wasn't too upset? He's was counting rabbits as he dozed off. When he's like that, he sees animals everywhere. And feels critters crawling under his skin. He tries to kill them with his gold toothpick. Write, "I, the unqersigned, Élizabeth Étamble..." - She wrote "Betty." - No, not Betty! Élizabeth. "I, the undgrsigned, Élizabeth Étamble, "née Fayet, "28 years old, no profession, "residing at 6 Ruysdael Avenue, in Paris, "hereby state "that I accept without reservation "the following conditions..." - I sold them. - Sold what, dear? I gotta get drunk. Excuse me. Of course. - You live around here? Paris? - No. I don't live anywhere! - Another one? - No. Your Yankee admirer came over with NATO when he was about 20. He settled here when he retired. He comes here almost every night in his old uniform. "Élizabeth," not "Betty," just as they told me. And I took the check. Then I left. But you don't give a crap! Mario. - Any gauze? - I think so. In the drawer. - I'll take her home. - You? - Why not? - To the Trianon? - She needs medical attention. - What for? Take her to my car. Be careful. Joseph! My friend's sick. Is the room next to mine free? Of course, ma'am. - Did I wake you? - I don't know. Need anything? - How do you feel? - I'm fine. Even my headache's gone. I think I'm hungry. What would you like? Ham and eggs. - Have you eaten? - Of course. Is it late? 4 p.m. Eggs well done? - Tea or coffee? - Coffee, black. Henri, some ham and eggs, well done, and coffee, black. Good coffee, not this morning's swill! Thank you. Shall I open the curtains? Did you give me a shot? I feel... Yes, but don't worry. I was a nurse for 25 years. My husband was a doctor. And I washed you, because you threw up. Care for a relaxing bath before breakfast? Don't get up, I'll run it for you. - It's not too hot? - It's just right. Are you feeling dizzy? Yes, a little. I'm ashamed to inconvenience you. Not at all. I've seen it all. Don't fall asleep in there. - No. - I've lived here three years. It feels like home. I had your clothes dry-cleaned. The maid'll bring them up soon. Henri. - Thank you. - My pleasure. I've found you some slippers. - They're a bit big. - They'll do. - I wish I knew your name. - It's Laure. Laure Levaucher. My husband taught medicine in Lyons. He died four years ago. Not eating? - I'm not hungry. - Yes, you are. You have to eat. I couldn't stand to live alone. I came here for a couple of weeks, but ended up staying. - My name's Betty. - Bon appétit, Betty. - I was plastered, right? - Sick, mostly. I know I was sloshed. Did I do anything stupid? My poor child, you obviously don't know The Hole. - Won't you eat? - I can't swallow. Maybe I should leave you alone? Need to call or write? No. Do you have errands to run? - I'll be off, then. - No... - Are you OK? - Not really. Feeling nauseous? Do you want a drink? Works for me. That's better... I didn't think I'd make it in time. - Do you know where you are? - Yes, of course. The Trianon in Versailles. You should rest here for a few days. I don't know... I'm apathetic. Look, Betty... I'll call you Betty, you call me Laure. OK. You seemed lost last night. Did you have a place to sleep? Care to hear my story? I was happily married for 28 years. Happy and privileged. My husband and my home meant the world to me. If I'd had kids, I wouldn't be here. In short, I have no more reason to live. I'm sure you understand. I started drinking heavily even before I came here. Leaving saved my life. But what happens to me, what I do now... ...is irrelevant. People come to visit the park, tourists register and check out... They must think I'm part of the staff. I put you up next door, in case you needed help. - I did. - Now it's up to you. You can leave or you can stay... ...for one or two more days. - Or change rooms. - No... Tonight, like every night, I'll be at The Hole. - Was it your first time? - Yes. - Didn't you notice anything? - In my condition... Mario claims all his patrons are "twisted." Wanna hear about Mario and The Hole? - Sure. - Another? - Will it harm me? - I doubt it. Mario seems like a tough guy. Most patrons think he did time. It makes the ladies swoon. In fact, he used to be a bartender. And a cab driver in Toulon. He claims he was a sailor, however. In any case, one of his fares was a rich South American lady. Her husband had just died of an embolism... ...coming out of a Monte Carlo casino. He owned a cocoa plantation in Colombia. According to Mario, she was totally twisted. Anyhow, he became her chauffeur and her jack-of-all-trades. - Is this boring? - No, on the contrary. We know a few facts, but the rest is mostly conjecture. The woman's name was Maria Orutti. She came from one of the country's oldest families. After her husband died, they begged her to return. They sent her telegrams, threatening to cut off the money. She became despondent. She'd tell Mario, "They hate me, they wanna kill me. "They'll put me in an asylum." She told him, "Come with me. You'll be able to protect me." So they sailed back together. But Mario never stood a chance. Her family and the police were waiting to take her away... How's school? Fine. So Mario was alone and flat broke. He claims he did odd jobs, not all of them legit... Do you know Lyons, Élizabeth? No, I don't. I suspect the family bribed him to go away. He wandered through Venezuela and Panama, and upon his return, scrounged up enough to buy The Hole. Soon he had a cast of regulars, patrons he likes to call "the twisted." People like me. Can I have luggage picked up in Paris? Certainly. Just leave us instructions. Please, Charles. A few suitcases and maybe a trunk. All right. 6 Ruysdael Avenue. - Mr. Étamble? Like the general? - I'm his daughter-in-law. Do you know how many pieces in all? No. - Win one car be enough? - Yes, of course. Maybe you should write me a note. No. How about this evening? Will someone be home? PLEASE GIVE THE PORTER MY STUFF There's always someone. Storms always kill a few. - More storms heading this way. - How do you know? Betty, how's the lasagna? - It's excellent. - Unlike the cassoulet. I like the cassoulet. - Starting to like it here? - I feel like a regular. Glad to hear it. Where's the regular twisted crowd? - Afraid to get wet, I guess. - It's still early. - No stomachache? - Not now. See that guy, the dead ringer for Kojak? He's an English lord. His name's John. He won't utter a word for hours. Instinctively, he always leaves at exactly the same time. Then he'll stand up, solid as an oak. And the girl will follow him. A new one every week. You'll never guess... You'll never guess what I did today. No, Mother, what did you do? - Catch a movie? - How did you guess? Just a hunch. What movie? It dealt with abortion. I loathed it. Aren't you watching, Élizabeth? No, thank you, Mother. Is the TV too loud, Guy? Not at all, Mother. - But I can work in my study. - I'd rather have you around me. Aren't Frédéric and Odile coming down today? They'll be here shortly. They're going out tonight. - Where to? - You can ask them. She ate. We're off to bed. Beddy-bye time. Yes, you too. I'll take my night off after they're asleep. Can Charlotte stay with us for five minutes? Don't give in, Élizabeth. My husband used to say, "If you want a child to respect you, - "never give in." - What's going on? It's out of the question. You're going straight to bed. Daddy has work to do. Off you go! - Say good night to Grandmother. - Good night. Sweet dreams. We have a reception at the Ministry, Mother. - Imagine that! - Lucky you. - Ought to be fun. - It'll be dreary, actually. But we have to attend. - Some port? - I'll get it. Just a drop. We can't show up tipsy. What's the occasion? For the Minister of Defense of Burkina Faso. - "Negroes." - Port or something else? - No, port. - Yes, some port. - Here's the port. - Thanks, dear. Will you serve? - And for you, Élizabeth? - No, thank you. Pleased with the nanny? Yes. She's perfect. We feel like intruders. Either they're possessive or incompetent. Remember Antoine's German nanny? - How could I forget? - She was such a pain! I had to obtain permission to visit Antoine. - Don't exaggerate. - I'm serious! Remember, Guy? Before you were with us, Betty. Frédéric, what was her name again? - Big Bertha, no? - Stop kidding around! - Frédéric, what was her name? - Yes, it was Bertha. No! Mother, do you remember Antoine's German nanny? What was her name? Mother? She fell asleep? Good God! - What's wrong? - I don't know. She looks dead. He just watched her as she lay on the bed... ...for over an hour. Finally, she realized he was asleep, an empty glass in his hand. Twisted, no? What are you thinking about? My mother-in-law. I know her. We lived on the same street in Lyons. - Strange. I had a feeling. - Really? - She suffered a heart attack. - My God! When? Seven or eight months ago. And how is she doing? Trust me, she's fully recovered! She's been back in Paris for three days...no, four. She's staying with us. With my husband Guy, her younger son. He turned down an army career. The General was fuming. Frederic, the older one, is working in the Defense Ministry. He lives above our place. I mean, Guy's. He married Odile Fleury, right? I knew her sister well. Her family in Lyons are distant relatives. Your mother-in-law is a Gomieux. Her father owned a company run by his sons...but not Hector, who became an optician. I feel like I'm in Lyons. I'm reminded of social costs. I know the Étambles own a house in Chassagne Forest, near Chalamont, where my brother goes duck hunting. I went there each of our six married years. The family would spend August there: the General, his wife, the two brothers, their wives and children. It was a living nightmare. Frédéric and Guy played tennis all day. Hello. I hope you're all in the mood for lasagna. - What else do you have? - Lasagna. We made a mistake. So I figured. - OK, we'll have lasagna. - Great. I have two children, two girls: Charlotte, four, and Anne-Marie, 19 months. They're starting to sound like grown-ups. Good evening, Laure. Please excuse my hasty departure last night, but I trust Laure explained... Your aunt must've been surprised. Auntie was up in the attic. Remember the attic? Then we climbed up silently, when suddenly Laurence goes... - Laurence! - She really sounded like a cow! Auntie got so scared she dropped the books she was carrying. - It's not their fault. - What? Mind if we left? - Are you feeling ill? - I dunno, I just wanna go back. Mrs. Étamble. Your luggage is in your room. The driver left this for you. It's Elda's handwriting. The nanny packed my bags. I'd better go, since... - You're going back? - No, but... You'd rather unpack alone, no? Would you mind staying? No, but I don't want to inconvenience you. I love packing and unpacking. I used to spend hours packing for trips with my husband. My mink! It's an investment. Since you'll need one some day anyway, it's best to buy it now because prices will keep rising. Guy said it was an investment. I was afraid he'd keep it. I'll fix you a drink. You shell out for everything. I'll let you buy the next two bottles, OK? My daughters. This one looks like you. She has your eyes. Cheers! Here's to you and all you've done for me. They're no longer my children. I'm not sure they were ever mine, except when I was pregnant. Do you believe in motherly love? I forgot you don't have kids. You couldn't know. Maternal love, like in books or songs, like we're taught in school. I believed in it when I got married. One day I'd have kids. It was a good concept: a home, a family... But when I learned I was expecting, I was taken aback. It all happened so quickly. After two years of marriage, the focus was on the child. Suddenly I was a "mother." Maybe I was jealous. But I don't think so. It was too soon for a third person. How they looked after me! When my health deteriorated, they went off the deep end! They expected me to stay bedridden. My mother-in-law came up from Lyons. Remember not to strain yourself. Think of the baby. Follow the doctor's orders. Every night, Guy brought me flowers and stayed for an hour. But he had nothing to say. They actually drove me to the clinic 48 hours early. I was sure I'd pay for all the harm I'd done. Yet I rebelled. It was all very confusing. I understand. Do you really? I don't think you can. Yes, I do understand! In any case, the child was born. It was a girl. Everyone pretended to be happy, especially my husband. He seemed so thrilled. But his love wasn't for me, it was for the baby's mother. It was "his" child. Any woman would've done. Then they hired a Swiss nanny. Get some rest, honey. Elda will look after the child. What's maternal instinct? I never even held her right. Elda was always taking the baby from me. I'd go to the nursery several times a day. Either the baby was sleeping, or Elda was busy feeding it. I was allowed to watch Elda change Charlotte's diaper. Everything was clean and in order. That was four years ago. Charlotte grew up. Though she talked and walked, she's still not mine. What'll they tell her? That I'm dead? That I set off on a long trip? Won't you see her again? They don't want me to. I promised. It's no big deal. Where's my drink? Now maybe you're feeling blue too. Thanks. Wanna see my father? He died in Morocco. I was only eight. He'd been there for a few months. I never found out why he went there...neither did my mother. But I remember him well. He was always kidding around. Mom told him, "Comb your hair for the photo." "I am the way I am." - Do you see your mother? - No, not often. My father owned... ...not a factory, but a store. He made fertilizers. A chemist ran the place after Dad died. She recently sold the store and kept the upstairs apartment. Did she remarry? No. When I was 10, she sent me to her sister's. She claimed the country air would do wonders for my health. Do you know the Vendée? No. Just the beach resort. We were living in Deux-Sévres. My uncle and aunt owned an inn in a nearby village. I loved it there. The rooms were damp, but they had comfortable feather beds. I forgot I had a photo of Thérèse. Who's Thérèse? The maid at the inn. She'd been in a foster home. She was 15. Always clad in a black dress. Her only dress. It made her breasts conspicuous. I was jealous. Thérèse! Thérèse! Now what's she up to? - Thérése! - Yes, ma'am? - Are the rooms made? - Yes, ma'am. Give us a hand. She was too old to be my friend. So I tried to hang around her. Schwartz teased me about that. Have I mentioned him? - No, I don't think so. - Of course I have! He was a medical student. He washed dishes to pay for his studies. He lived in a maid's quarters near the Place des Ternes. I met him because he lived in the area. Charlotte was almost a year old. You could see hundreds of chimneys from his bed. The event involving Thérèse marked your childhood. Tell me more. What happened? It was a Saturday. My aunt drove to the St. Mathurin market. It was during vacation. Or maybe I skipped school. I forget. He kept pounding into her. It smelled like a stable. I couldn't move. It was like I was hypnotized. Their thighs mesmerized me. Tell your aunt and you're next! I wanted to stay till the end, see Thérèse's face afterwards, hear her voice... Schwartz told me plenty about my affection for Thérèse. She was still a girl, like me. In fact, she liked to play with my dolls. It's Lolita! Do you want the clinical and medical truth? You envied her. - Really? - Yes, really. You longed for it. It's true that I started following her around. Everywhere she went. Turns out she didn't just hump my uncle. He was jealous, so he spied on her. I caught her twice: once, in a field in winter, with a farm boy in red boots. Then at the inn... Hurry before he comes up! Wait... Stickel dealt with a similar case. You failed to see she liked it. You figured she had to suffer at the hands of a man. He was right. I thought women had to be victims. I was afraid. Terribly afraid... ...yet tempted. I was so tempted and afraid it made me ill. Is this boring? No, not at all. Quite the contrary. I'll get you a drink. My uncle never touched me. I lived there till I was 14. I wondered what I'd do if he dragged me down into the cellar. I would've been afraid, but not enough to scream. Or struggle. But he didn't try anything. No, he didn't. When I saw Thérèse in the cellar, I wanted to ask her... I wanted to tell her, "Show me your wound." I also wanted to have a wound. I've always been chasing that wound. Maybe I'm looking for pity. But I'm no victim. Why should I be pitied? No one's ever hurt me. My actions have caused others to hurt. I'm foolish. Say it. I screwed up my life big time. It's all my fault. It started at 15. I became a whore to be like Thérèse. I sold my children. My husband kicked me out. The document says... "I, Élizabeth Étamble, née Fayet, "declare that I am a whore, that I had lovers "before and during my marriage, whom I met in bars. "And that I made love next to my children's room." Here's proof I sold my children. 200,000 F! As a down payment. Anything less looks cheap. He said, "I don't want you to be destitute." I don't want you to be destitute. Send me your new address so my lawyer can get in touch with you. You'll never be in need. So that's my wound, all my wounds, all the men I've lusted after. I drank secretly for years... ...to cope, because I'm different. Anyway, I don't wanna be like them. But I quit drinking when I got pregnant. I gave him the kids he wanted, but I wanted them to be healthy. I took a bottle with me to the hospital, and after the delivery... I'm nothing but a drunk and a whore! Calm down. - Don't be an idiot! - You're just like them! Come on. Go to bed. Get undressed. You're as cold as ice. I'll prepare a hot water bottle. Mrs. Étamble? Can you hear me? - Who's this? - The switchboard. I have a call from Paris. I'll connect you. Hello, Betty? It's Florent. - Can you hear me? - Yes. I can hardly hear you. You OK? Yes. Are you sure? Yes. Are you in pain? - Are you still in bed? - Yes. Can I talk to you? Are you alone? Yes. Guy asked me to meet with you. The sooner the better. I could be there later today. Let's have dinner. No, not today. Tomorrow morning? I'll be in court tomorrow afternoon. - No, not tomorrow. - OK, when? You decide. I dunno. I'll call you. Are you all right? Need help? I'm fine, I don't need any help. Good-bye, Florent. You slept through Act II on my shoulder. On purpose. - How about a drink? - Sounds good. Taking my wife? I'll take yours. - Know where it is? - Yeah, no problem. Betty! Don't pick your nose! That's gross. Robert! Change your smock! You're all pigs! What can you do? We are the way we are. Not again! Write 50 times, "I'm a dirty little girl." It's true I'm dirty. But I wanted to be clean. I'm very sorry. Guy, isn't that your new suit? It was, you mean. Look! - Got a stain remover? - I'll check. - Are you a dry cleaner? - No, but my dad was a chemist. So you know about chemicals! - I'm sorry. - I know you are. To make amends, sit down and join us for coffee. I can't... I'm late. - No. - Yes! You can't very well refuse. All right, I accept. Good. Don't worry, his suit's two years old. Three, actually. - Here you go. - Thank you. Another coffee, please. So what do I do with this? - Shall I remove your stain? - Yes, please. - Seriously? - Yes. You're crazy! Yes, I'm crazy! Well? What do you say? I'm listening. - Guy... - You don't love me enough? You know that's not true. Well? We shouldn't get married. It's better. Really? Why? Because of everything. Me, my life... I wasn't born yesterday. Your past is none of my business. - I've done sordid things. - I don't care. You don't understand. I took pleasure in doing them. It's over. It's over. Do you love me? Yes. Then life starts here. With a new slate. For both of us. Saturday you'll meet my mother in Lyons. - I can't keep house. - Don't be silly! You won't have to. You're my wife. He's a sweet guy. And he's a good lay. That's why sometimes I figure I'm vile. He doesn't look after me. He tries, but he only looks after what I symbolize. If I'm sick, for example, he'll send me to the doctor. The family doctor, who's quite a character. He doesn't want his wife to be sick. Not me, the mother of his child! His upbringing is to blame. You can't help it, huh? You're still sublimating. You wanna fatten me up? How typical of you! Transposing the mental to the physical. What's worse, you accuse me! Truly typical. Careful. Dr. Freud, aren't you studying dermatology? So what? You can't dissociate the exterior from the interior, the material from the spiritual. Know why you're misled? No, why? In your jumbled little head, you see yourself as a heroine. You have some idea of what you want to be, or should be, and you're sinking faster as a result. I'm "sinking"? You keep lying, and not just to others. You lie to yourself to hide the truth. Whenever you're uneasy, you start telling yourself stories. Shut up! - I'm not your guinea pig. - Keep it up... ...and you'll end up in the morgue. Or the loony bin. Eat! I was wondering if you were asleep. You OK? Hungry? - Shall I order breakfast? - No, thank you. Not even a cup of coffee? Does your pulse ever drop steeply? You prefer the dark? I don't care. The darkness is depressing. You must've slept well. I didn't hear a peep. Are you in any pain? Migraine? I should call a doctor. I know a very good one here. Bernard? No. And I promise he won't pry. I don't care. Shall I wash your face? No. Blanche? Laure Levaucher. Is the doctor in? Hello, doctor. Sorry to disturb you. No, I'm calling on behalf of a friend of mine... I'd like you to come see her. Last night I gave her some phenobarbital. Now her pulse is 53. No, I doubt it's an allergic reaction. I'm guessing she's in her late 20s. Yes, I'll wait here. Come straight up to my room. Betty! Are you still asleep? It's 1 p.m. The doctor'll be here in 45 minutes. Care to wash up or eat? No, thanks, Laure. Please close the door behind you. As you wish. Sleep well. What are you thinking about? About you. - Well? - What? Well what do you think about me? It's complex. - You're like my sister. - What? When you lecture me. When you provoke me, I think of her. What if I didn't show up here? But you do. I'd look for you. - At my place? - Yeah. What about my husband? Dear, tonight I'm taking Mother to a play. - All right, Mother? - Great. I love Anouilh. I forgot it's Elda's day off. It doesn't matter, I don't want to see a play. I'll be off. See you tonight. - Gotta go. - Stay five minutes. - Write me a note? - What? I'm kidding. When will Elda be here? Not before midnight. The baby looks sick. We'll take ggod care of her. Right, Élizabeth? Of course, Mother. After my dentist appointment, I can pick up the kids - at school. - Fine. See you tonight. Betty! Can you go see? The baby is crying. Yes, Mother. Don't bother getting up. How'd it go? He made me wait an hour, then he found a problem. And he hurt me. But a visit to the dentist is much less painful today. I have to make a call! I'll take the kids so they don't bother Grandma. They don't bother me. Still, they should come with me. Dinner at our place tonight, Betty! I know! I can't talk now. But I'll call after dinner, at about nine. - So you won't be lonely? - Don't be silly. - Odile's upstairs. - Some company! Now hurry. - You have the tickets, dear? - Yes, Mother. - Go, I'm fine. - I can wait. No, get some rest. Thank you. Good night. Hello, is that you? Are you sad? No, not that! I had a hell of a day. - Same here. - Did you miss me? You know where I live. The kids are asleep. No nanny, no maid, and my husband's at the theater. So? Don't you understand? - Yes. - You don't seem thrilled. Listen... I've been longing for this, as you'll see. - Come. - Yes. Come. - Are you afraid? - No. Not happy to see where I live? - You don't like it? - Yes. But I hate it. Come! What's wrong? - What about the kids? - Their rooms's back there. Wait! If Charlotte wakes up, we'll know. Don't sulk. Let's enjoy this. Go fetch Frédéric. You lie down on the sofa. No! No, not there! My drops, hurry! In my purse. Twenty drops. Élizabeth! Guy wants to see you. In the living room. Come in. Have a seat. Our lawyer was kind enough to come over right away. I know Mother and I shouldn't have returned home unexpectedly. But she felt in. Please excuse us. Guy! I consider the statement you will hear to be fair. Generous, actually. It's quite simple: You recognize your mistakes, you give up custody of the children and the right to see them. In exchange, we guarantee your financial security. Either you accept to settle this quietly... ...or we'll fight a war you're sure to lose. What must I do? Write, "I, the undersigned, "Élizabeth Étamble..." - She wrote "Betty." - No, not Betty. Élizabeth. "I, the undgrsigned, Élizabeth Étamble, "née Fayet, "28 years old, no profession, "residing at 6 Ruysdeal Avenue, in Paris, "hereby state "that I accept without reservation "the following conditions..." A check for your urgent needs. Send me your new address so my lawyer can get in touch with you. No, Betty. Please. Let them sleep. They wouldn't understand. You're not well? What's ailing you? Let me have a look. I'll wash my hands. Did she eat breakfast? No, she wouldn't eat. - Not even coffee? - No. Are you in pain? Any kind of pain? Headaches, chest contractions? You can stay. - It's OK. - I have to make a call. Is that you? No, I'm at the hotel with Betty. The doctor's examining her. Have you ever been treated for low blood pressure? In two hours from now. I'll explain. See you then. I love you. On your stomach. - Dizzy spells? - I've had a few recently. But did you lose your balance? Not quite. - Any recent emotional trauma? - Doctor... We haven't helped matters. We've both been drinking. I gave her two phenobarbitals of 100 mg and she slept well. The phone woke her up. She's been like this since then. There's no organic disease. But you need plenty of rest. And hospital supervision. - I'd rather not. - I won't insist. You can recover just as well here. - Do you have guests? - No, no one. That's good. Don't go out for a few days. Eat in moderation. I recommend vegetable soup. Rest quietly. Understand? - Yes - Good. On your stomach again. I'll give you a shot. No, Betty. Please. Let them sleep. They wouldn't understand. - Ice? - Yes. Make it a double. - Soda water? - I don't care. No. Another one. - Don't bother, he's not there. - He's not back? He came back and left, with his bag and his sax. He was in a big hurry. He asked me to rent the studio. Where's Philippe? Philippe? The sax player? Sorry, I don't see him. Buy you a drink? - If you like. - I would. What'll it be? A whisky. A whisky. A double for the lovely lady. - Ice? - Yes. - Soda water? - I don't care. - What's your name, beautiful? - Betty. It's over there! Here we are. - Is Room 3 free, Maria? - Right away! Go ahead. Start peeling! Wake up! Your hour's up. - I wanna sleep. - But not here! You can't stay! So you don't wanna leave? I'll show you! I bet you're an illegal alien! Nothing but trouble! Scram! I need the room... ...but not the hassles! He's just a poor kid, you know? He was terrified, but now I gotta find him. He must be scared of Guy, but Guy couldn't care less. I bet he knew all along. Are you happy? Where are you taking me? - I'm following you. - Where would I take you? You have no place to go? You're not a thief, are you? Let's go to my place. My place, OK? Come! Keep quiet! I'm sure she's asleep. I'd better make sure. What else did she say? So much I forget... She's a lost soul. She doesn't know what she wants. At times, she has the scared look of a beaten dog. Yes... But at other times, her eyes are a complete blank. Expressionless. - Do you think she's aloof? - No, she's sweet! Let's hope she'll be taken in by some kind soul. Is she sleeping? Go take a look. Still, it's weird... She's always sleeping. - Is she sleeping? - Looks like it. See, what did I tell you? Give me another drink. No, I'll get it. Hello? Yes. No, this is Laure Levaucher. Yes... It's for you. A Mr. Étamble. Maybe it's Frédéric. - Ask his first name. - Easier said than done. Which Mr. Étamble? Your husband. - Can he come up? - No, certainly not! - I'll go down instead. - But the doctor said... I don't want him up here. Besides, I feel fine. Tell him I'll meet him in the lobby in 30 minutes. - Am I disturbing you? - No. Of course not. Florent said you didn't sound well on the phone. I was worried you were sick. No, I was tired. But I'm feeling better. - Have you seen a doctor? - Yes. - What'd he say? - I'll be fine in a few days. Shall we go for a walk? Is someone looking after you? A girlfriend. - How are the kids? - They're fine. But Charlotte has a cold, so she's housebound. Is your mother back in Lyons? Tomorrow. About that document you signed... I... ...don't intend to use it right away. Not having heard from you... I was very worried. That's what Florent told me. I asked him to set up a meeting with you, but... - You turned him down. - I had to get better. - Did you have a breakdown? - I dunno. It's no big deal. Look, given the situation, we can't be too hasty. We have to think things through. This isn't just about us... We discussed it at length, Mother, Frédéric and I... Maybe it isn't the best solution, but...please understand. It'd be difficult for you to come home right now, but you shouldn't stay alone here... Are you alone? - Didn't anyone tell you? - No, yes... I knew. We were thinking you could stay with Mother in Lyons. But you can stay here and recover a while longer. You'd be living with her... ...and later on... Was this your idea? We all came up with it. - And you figured I'd accept? - I don't know what to think. - Is that what you want? - I'm thinking of the kids. - And of you too. - Thank you, Guy. I'm really touched by your gesture. And your mother's. Please thank her for me. - So it's no? - It's better this way. Especially for all of you. I warned you, remember? You wouldn't listen. I'm glad you came. It's better to leave on good terms. Getting romantic? I'll call Florent in a few days. You'd better go. Remember to thank your mother. I may have hurt you, but I'm not to blame. But please forgive me anyway. Now go. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Do you need anything? - No, nothing. - Good luck, Betty. - Thanks. You too, Guy. Thanks. - How did it go? - Very well. - He wants me back. - Really? - What did you say? - I said no. - It's over. - You can handle it? Yes! Got a cigarette? Yes... Mind if I go out? - You're OK now! - Of course! Don't worry. You've nursed me long enough. - No problem. - Going to The Hole? No, Paris, to see my banker, my financial advisor and other people. I'll be off. Call Mario if you need help. See you tonight. - Get some rest. - Good-bye, Laure. Mario! You're here! I'm so happy! Afraid? No. - I have to go to The Hole. - I'll come with you. No way. Doctor's orders. He doesn't know what it's like to be a woman. - I've never been happier! You? - I'm happy. - Good night, ma'am. - Thank you, Julien. - Where do you live? - Above the club. It's an old farm. Beams galore. Tonight we drink champagne. OK? I promise I'll drink in moderation. Yes? That's all. Tell Mr. Raymond to send my bill to Lyons. - You have the address? - Yes, of course, ma'am. We hope to see you again soon. - Good-bye, François. - Good-bye, ma'am. Thank you. - Good-bye, Charles. Thank you. - Good-bye, ma'am. Thank you. - Good-bye, Joseph. Thank you. - Good-bye, ma'am. Safe journey, ma'am. Thank you. Remember Mrs. Levaucher? Laure Levaucher? - The professor's widow? - Yes. She's dead. Her maid found her dead in bed. It's in the paper. Didn't she leave Lyons ages ago? - Wasn't she living in Paris? - In Versailles. But she kept her apartment here. - The cause of death? - Not specified. She wasn't very old. 49. She was young. How are your children? They're fine. They're very happy. Guy's daughters are adorable. Poor Laure Levaucher... I used to run into her occasionally. She was beautiful. A little pale. But I never knew she was ill. She could never have known that Laure Levaucher had died because Betty had survived. It was one or the other, and Betty had won.
