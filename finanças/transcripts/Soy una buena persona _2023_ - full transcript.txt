You're cool, too, Sabrina. Sabina! Sabina! Besides... I love how thoughtful you are. And creative. -You write... -Yes. You act... You design your own clothes. You teach... You even have time to bartend. I've always been a rebel. And independent. Always. Because independence rocks, right? Independence... rocks. -A lot. -Yes. -It makes you free. -Yes. -It's everything. It's everything. By the way... You're buying, right? Well, I had a problem with my card. Bank stuff. No. What do you mean no? It's just that... I'm a bit... tight. I mean, I've been through a bad phase. That can't be. You're the most active person I know. There must be something. I'm self employed. Shit. But styling makes money. Well, the films... I make them for free. But because you know it's the way to make a name. So they call you. And how long have you been doing that? From 2009. And the clothing line? Well, that's just a notebook. A notebook where I draw my crazy ideas I have them all there. What about acting? Acting? Oh, yes. I did a gig last month. A producer came to see me one night. I'm on fire. -You also write, don't you? -Yes. Yes, I write on Facebook, on my blog. And for a friend's fanzine. No wonder you bartend. I don't exactly bartend. I go to a friend's bar to help. He's even more broke than me. But he does buy a drink every once in a while. This is weird, isn't it? I mean... Excuse me but we're almost 40. And here we are. In a posh bar. Drinking. We pay for all platforms, don't we? -And we attend many events. -It's the fucking recession. It's the recesion and the fucking capitalism. That's the problem. No, it's worse. We're on a recession but we don't behave accordingly. Well, then how do you get by? Wanna know the truth? My parents. Me too. -The worst part is they're retired. -Yeah, mine too. They have a shitty pension. -I'm super wet. -I can see that. From behind. -Come on, fuck my donut. -Donut? -Fucking Drill my donut. -Okay, okay. Already? Sorry, sorry... I'm sorry. Already. Shit, more than 20 hours on Whatsapp and you come in your pants? You rushed it. -I didn't expect... -For fuck sake. It was too fast. What did you want? A hotel? -Ten minutes. Give me... -I have things to do. Ok, shall we meet up some other time? There's no fucking some other time. Get out! What about the bill? Man, I promise I'm a good person. Fuck, mom! You're gonna kill me one day. Stop being lazy. Romulo and Remo will dry you. Get dressed. We're waiting for you. Don't do this to me. Here. (she sings) M for Mother. A for Friendship. Mom, what's that? A song I liked as a child. I heard it on the radio the other day. R for... R for Rose. -I for immaculate. -Fucking shut up. What now? You're so skinny. Not even yoga at the gym. Look how skinny you are. What are you doing? They were going bad. You sure you're alright? So gross, mom. Mari, make me a latte. For fuck sake. Again, Mari? You stopped taking your meds again? Fuck. First, good morning. Good morning. See? It's not so complicated. What example are you giving the kid? Sabina, you saw your mother. You talk as if it was my fault. No, I'm not saying it's yours nor mine. Nor hers. Sometimes I think she's dead. Can you believe it? I sleep with a dead woman every night. Dad, I'd prefer you not telling me that. You don't want to listen. But it'll also happen to you. You'll see. You'll be a dead woman too. With someone on top trying to move. Dad, please. What are you doing today? I have yoga. Yoga? Very well. Yoga and then gym. A completed day. I know what you're gonna say. Shit. I'm looking but there's nothing. I update LinkedIn daily. What? -A website. -Uh huh. A website to search for a job. What kind of job? At your age you won't be Penelope Cruz. Nor Vogue director either. Mari, you alright? Yes. Dad, I really am looking but... it's not easy to find any job. Yes, but... You need to realize you won't be more famous than you are now. Are you an oracle or what? I'm just saying Your mom and I dedicated our lives for you to fight for your dream. To be an actress, a writer, a singer. Whatever. And we did it happily. But... There comes a time it's too heavy. It's too much. How much do you have left? A couple of days. I mean money. 20,000€. It sounds good, sure. If this place was ours, but... One still have 5 years of mortgage. Well, and... There'll come a time when... You'll have to look after us. No. What you mean no? I mean no. When you start to dodder... You're going to the nursing home. You fucker. Dad, please. -What? -It's too early. You were leaving, right? Imagine we're not here tomorrow. What would you do with 20,000€ I'll hustle. Yeah, right. You. Hustle. -I'd invest. -Invest? You? I'd get a loan. -Where? -The bank. What bank? Don't stress me out. You'll keep with your yoga... and your videos until you've run out. Hilarious. I must remind you I'm going to Dani's bar this afternoon. That Dani is going to hire you? Yes, I'll tell him today. -You better. -No, he better... Alright. Sorry for the ambush but we must talk. Cristobal's not here. Yeah, but... -You done? -Yeah. Ok, Cristobal's not here. He's always late. We've been waiting 20 minutes -We can wait til half past. -No, no. There's no time. I wanna spend only an hour. So I'll tell you and you can tell him. Why don't you tell them all? Alright. I will. Come on, Dani. What's going on? We got work. As I said, it's imporant. Otherwise You wouldn't be here. -Can I have a beer? -Sure thing. Why don't you get it? It's there. Not on duty. Then hold on. This is also work. If this is work, you're gonna pay us, right? -It's overtime. -Just a few minutes. But we've been waiting for Cristobal. Not my fault. Well... Numbers don't add up lately. Last month 700€ overdraft. The one before 450€. Are you accusing us? Not accusing anybody. Just stating a fact. There's money missing and I'm not taking it. It does look like you're accusing us. How do we know it's not you? 'Cause it's my fucking bar. I'm not gonna steal from myself. You say things aren't going well. Right, because someone's stealing. Someone... from us? Maybe everyone. So you're accusing us. Not even my mother can do that, pig. -Pig? -Pig. Let's be more specific. More specific? This looks like a fucking questioning. Last Friday, when Coral closed... 200€ missing. Are you saying I stole it? This doesn't sound right. Are you gonna smoke? I rule here. I'll say if we can smoke. You do? Who am I? A customer or your fucking boss? No smoking. I can get fined. Don't change the subject. You're calling me thief to my fucking face. I'm not calling you anything. Just asking for an explanation. 200€ missing and I'd like to know where they are. You can't be so abusive to Coral. True, Dani. It's not nice. I don't like you not trusting us. I did as usual. I balanced the register and locked up. Well, you didn't lock properly. 200€ missing. Where are they? You don't have to answer, Coral. He already took our 20 minute break. This is a bar. You're a bartender. You want a coffee? Get one. We should have time for coffee and gin and tonic. And one hour for board games. Right. And to go to mass. Don't fuck with me. Where's the money? Look, Dani. I have no fucking idea what you're talking about. Shut up, Coral. Dani, let me tell you something. This isn't right. We work hard for you. And you don't trust us. -For me? -Yes. -I'm paying you. -You're calling us thieves. -Well said. -I want an hour for board games. In other bars, that's a right. An hour for board games? -Yes. -And it depends. It's not the same playing "Adventure on the train" than Rin Battel or Time's up. Or Bank. That's 2 hours. It's very addictive. Very addictive! Bank, Bank, Bank. You're creating a toxic atmosphere, Dani. Very toxic. Do you know anything about mental health? Do you know that for less than this people slit their wrists? Well, alright. We leave it here. Nobody took anything, OK? No, not OK. Apologize. OK, I'm sorry. I apologize. I get it, Dani. Really. It's OK. I get you're stressed, darling. -We all are. -OK, I apologize to everyone. Are you gonna pay for this hour? Alright. I will. But only if we open at 7. Easy, boy. Don't shout. It's enthusiasm. I'm not yelling. Are you gonna pay Cristobal? -Cristobal hasn't showed up. -He says he's coming. He's in a uber. -Sorry to be late. -Hi Sabi. Dani, I have to speak with you. I can't now. We're late and I want to open at 7. Go with Nando and we'll talk later. -Asshole. -You're an asshole. Can't stand Nando. He treats me like I'm an idiot. Everyone in the team thinks you are. -Excuse me? -Not an idiot. They think you're a bit slow. They don't have a good opinion of me and I don't give a fuck. Aren't you going to do something? Yes, I'm giving them half an hour so they can play parchisi And one hour overtime. Do you think it's easy to make this work? With this bunch of idiots, I guess not. They also steal from me. They're good bartenders. They've been bartending all their lives. They're not good people. -Dani. -What? -Are you listening? -Yeah, sure. Well, no. I'm doing inventory. I have to count and can't make mistakes. You're here like... -You want anything? -Yes, I do. Fire one of them and get me in. -What? Shit... -What's so funny? -You don't know how a bar works, Sabi. You've never bartended before and it shows. One thing is you coming to help. Which I thank you. And another one is hiring one. I can't do that. You understand? -Dani. -Yes? I'm desperate. I'm willing to do anything. The hell you're doing? -Do you need me to explain? -I gotta work. You have to relax. I'm trying but with you here trying to... I can't... I can't... Sabi, no. This means nothing because I can't hire you. Maybe not now, but later who knows? Let me see what's in here. Well, on the other hand... I could do with some relax. Been sleeping badly. You can tell from my dark eyes. -Not so hard. You're hurting me. -Softer? Yes, as if caressing me. Don't talk so loud. They might hear us upstairs. -OK, I can whisper to your ear. -Right. -Faster now? -No, you're going to rip it off. I mean, just caress. Just caress. Is it normal this is so tender? Well, I have to concentrate. Feels like an squid. 'Cause I'm very stressed. I told you. I also take meds and it's difficult to get it up. -What do you take? -100 of... Right. 100 of Pristiq in the morning. 100 more at night. -Hidro...hidrofebron. -Hidroferol. -That's for suicidal thoughts. -That's right. Autolytic, which isn't the same. Well, I take them, too. Also... 2 of I don't know what and Rayaldee. -And Ansium? -3 of Ansium. -I take them, too. Morning, afternoon and evening. But you don't have to get it up. It's an advantage. This is still soft. Can I do anything? It's going to be useless... And I don't like you doing this. -This? -Humiliate you to get a job. It's not right. Go fuck yourself. What's she doing here? Move. You're always in the way. What? Does it bother you? -Can't you tell? -Please, take it easy. Yes, alright. -Fuck. See what I told you? -Stop it. -You're creating a toxic atmosphere. Me? Didn't you say they're all idiots? Yes, but you're still clumsy. Well, I have to learn or they knew it from the start? Not everyone can do this. You're saying I can't work in a fucking bar? I knew you'd take it personal. -Listen... -Fuck you, Dani. You're a coward. See if you can throw some viagra to your meds. I got a bit wet though. When did you win four? You bitter assholes can rot in this shithole serving drinks I'm destined to better things. Don't laugh. You'll see me on TV, HBO, Movierama. You'll stay here. Serving drinks to people who don't look at your fucking face. You losers. A bunch of losers! Assholes! -Losers? What did she say? - I don't know. -Movierama. -Why do you have four? It's my turn. -Hey. -What do you want? -No, no. Are you OK? -You fucking horndog. I just wanted to help. -Just that. I thought you'd fallen. -I'm sorry. I'm not a rapist. Shit, I just wanted to help you. You're not that hot. You're not. Shit, fucking women. The shit we have to put up with. What a sad day. Just like my family. What do you want? To hear from you. Is it too much? Come in. Have you been smoking? No. Sabi, it smells. Why do you ask then? -Hey do you have a spliff? -Dad, please. Come on. Come on. -I'll roll one and you leave. -Alright. Shall we share it? Better. What are you doing? Mind your business. I know about my business. An article. About? What everyone's writing about: Veronica Forque. Shit. Poor woman. She killed herself, didn't she? It looks like that. I don't know if I told you. I have a gun in the nightstand. Your uncle Ivan gave to me in case things got ugly. Dad, please. Maybe you need it before I do. This is serious. Her assistant found her hanged in the bathroom. Did you know who she was? Of course. She did a couple of films with Amenabar. With Almodovar. That's not enough for the article, is it? I can find the rest online. Wikipedia, etc. Where you going to publish it? On Facebook. I might post it on my blog. I don't really care about the subject. The subject? This woman. I think it was your mom's age. Was she? Maybe a bit older but... I think she was older. Let me see. 1955. So you get things online to post them online later. You don't get it. How could I? It's absurd. The generational gap. What's that? Leave me alone to write, dad. Why writing about a woman you don't care about? I want to write something motivational and nice. Something that reaches people. When I die I want something nice written about me. Anything else? Just out of curiosity. Who asks you to do this? They're favors for friends. And no, I'm not getting paid. Then those people owe me a favor. That's how the world works. Right... 40 years working like a dog. And I didn't know how the world works. I guess you're right. Things have changed. This Dany guy, is he going to hire you? Don't talk to me about Dani. -He's a jerk. -What happened? Dad, please, let me write. You're giving me anxiety. -Anxiety? -Yes. Anxiety is what I got this morning cleaning your mom's shit. She shat herself again? Yes, she did. Sabina, I have cancer. What? When were you going to tell me? I got diagnosed a month ago. Now what? Nothing. I won't do any treatment. It's too advanced. -There's metastasis so... -But... Dad... and now? What do I do? (he mocks her) You son of a bitch! Fuck! -You should've seen your face. -Fuck, dad. I'm leaving you doing your thing. One more thing. The woman in the picture is not Veronica Forque. Go fuck yourself. Leave me... You know Sabi's coming? What? That bitch is coming? She's so extra. One day she's an actress. Another day a writer, a comedian... Always living off her parents. Well, you also live with your parents. Yes, but it's not that obvious. She's not discreet. Control your brother, alright? -Why? What did he do? -He looks at me and drools 'Cause he likes you. Look at his face. Am I supposed to be comfortable about that, Maika? Well, of course. Are Eva and Sabi going to coincide? They won't like each other. Who knows. They're just as annoying so it could be. What about this place? It's Robert's friend's. We are cat sitting. Where's the cat? Good question. What's up, bitches? Come here babe, give me a kiss. Say hello to Jaira, she's here. Here, babe. -Hi, Robert. -Suck my dick? -Fuck off. -Is that a proposal? I'm bringing the king. Stand to attention. That's my girl. That must be Sabi. Eva told me she was late 'cause of the train. The train? So cheap. Come on, Jaira. You suck my dick? Leave me alone, you jerk. Weren't you an ally and a columnist at El Publico? I'm not on duty. I'm trying an open relationship with my girl. You're such an asshole. Hey, this idiot touched my boob. Stop it or I'll lock you up in the dark room. Fucking go away. Everything under control. He's harmless. Cheers! Surprise! They're both here. We bumped into each other downstairs. Trying to find the gate. This thing of stair B top right is confusing. Well, have a sit, ladies and help yourselves. That's right, Robert. Behave yourself. Jaira, here we do what my missus says. Eva, we didn't ask for a dress code. What are you wearing? Weren't we going out? I think we feel more like ordering pizza. Pizza! They're like beggars. Ignore them. Hey, have some respect. We're educated. How's Madrid, Eva? How long have you been there? 10 days, but I just don't get used to it. My friend Hector is showing me around. -You know him? -Yes, Hector. -He's nice. -Good guy. He's got his stuff... -Like everybody else. -Not true. Maybe more. He's so false. And dodgy. Did you see his selfie before bed? It's so ridiculous. Better post a dick pic instead. You deserve better, Eva. With those cute boobs. It's like comparing God with a gypsy. Listen to the columnist at El Publico. -Come here with that mouth. -Hey. Hello, I'm here! Sabi, we said hello. Relax, girl. Fuck you. Is somebody calling to order pizza or do I call the Italians? What do you have against Italians? Italians can suck my dick. Sabi, how's the bar going? Got fired. Well, I quit. -So sad. -So bad. You know what really pisses me off? The fucking muslims. I'm with you, Robert. I can't stand the muslims. -Fucking communism. -Those fascist need to work. They come here to steal our jobs and our women. -You don't have a job, babe. -You know what I mean. I'm very progressive. I respect religion a lot, but... They smell bad. Nobody says it, but they smell. They all have a big dick. A big one. They hate everyone. They're all bisexual. How's your novel going? Go home, you fucking ignorant. Hey, we're not animals. It's OK. I got many books rejected. That doesn't make me a loser. Are you calling me a loser, bitch? I'll slap the shit out of you. Are you an idiot or what? Come here, girl. He's an idiot. Retarded. Handicapped. He's special abilities. Flying is not among them. He was about to jump off. He tries every day. Don't you, buddy? But he doesn't get it. It's what happens when you're retarded. I mean unadapted. Show's over. Go to the dark room. -You locking him up in the bathroom? -Well, yes. Just a moment. Yes, better. I was sick of him looking at my toochie. Word. Alone and drunk I wanna make it home. They're all pigs. Incels even more. All retarded are incels, right? -Wanks. -I knew it. I bet they're whorehounds, too. Here's a drink to push down those lines. Glasses? In the sink. Whorehounds are gross. How's your onlyfans going? Pretty well. Getting lots of followers. You should be more careful with the pics. It looks like your house stinks. What are you saying, asshole? Don't get offended. You can be a slut... With glamour. I'll give some advice... Get some waxing. Excuse me? What you got there looks it came from Mordor. I have no complaints so far. Your choice. My choice what, bitch? You're the one on onlyfans. Here comes the working class. I saw your pic on Instagram. With your boobs out and three green veins about to explode It was up for 3 minutes. Bad filter choice. -Look at the screenshot. -Delete that. Not to mention the anarchist tweets from this one I'm not an anarchist. I'm a communist. I thought we were lefties. -Same thing. -National socialism. That's like a nazi. -I'm lefty-ish. -I'm a nihilist. Everyone's a hedonist. Period. Right. Not marxism nor feminism. How about Japanese food? Asian. Have some respect. They suffer. -Yes, girl. -Sorry. Sorry, Asian. We're teasing you. So innocent. Sorry. Thank God you're pretty. Hi. Hi. You alright? Why? Nothing. Maica told me you're a writer. Well, I wrote the pilot of a TV show. Cool. So? What? What happened? Well, nothing. What was it about? I don't know. The perspective wasn't clear. I didn't finish it. I didn't... I didn't feel like it. It's very demanding. I'm a writer, too. -Right. -A writer, I mean. I'm in Madrid. Couldn't you write from your town? I have an interview. I wrote a bible and a pilot and sent it to Movierama. I have an interview on 25th at 12. -At Movierama? -Yes. They're dodgy. Who did you talk to? Carlos? -Jonas? Estela? -You know them? They're friends. With Joaquin Kibris. -No idea. -The boss. Oh, Joaquin! Yeah, be careful with him. He'll hit on you for sure. What are you doing? That's Jaira's jacket, right? Getting paid for some debt. She knows that? Yes, sure. It was at Tosca. -She told me to take it. -Alright. I'm so excited about this project. I'm nervous about the interview. Maika told me you're really good. I thought we could talk. You could help me. We're colleagues. Advice number one. Never help someone who's better than you. OK, I'll write it down. Hold on. When do you have the interview? On 25th at 12pm. At their Princesa offices. We only spoke by email. They don't what I look like. I don't know what to wear. He's an expert confusing people. Don't get too excited. You won't cry later. Got paid upfront. How much? Not nice to tell. -Tell me. How much? -Alright. We're colleagues. -Yeah. -10,000. For the show? The pilot. -They'll fool you. -We're shooting in September. The meeting is to talk about the cast. They want my opinion. They want to be... Don't know... Show business. Showrunner. Did Robert owe you money too? Mind your own business, smarty pants. So sorry. I didn't want to bother you. Artists are very sensitive. The yokel came dressed to accept a Goya. Gotta go. It's getting late. Wait. I'll go with you. I think it's that way. Hold on, I know this part. There's a taxi stop this way, OK? This area is creepy. People might think... Relax. I'm prepared. Look. If a guy comes near, I'll cut his balls and eat them. But... You alright? I don't... I don't usually drink. i'm a bit dizzy. Relax. I won't leave you. I'll walk you home. Wait. Where do you live? -I don't... -Relax. It's not necessary. Come on. Go on. Breathe. Swings! What's she doing? Swings! Stop! You're a bit crazy. It's fear. So many things happening lately. The show, coming here... Meeting your friends. They're a bunch of assholes. I've always been so childish. When I saw the swings, I ran. -My heart skipped a beat. -Really? I loved to swing as a child. I swung so hard it felt like flying. I don't know. My friends told me I could turn completely. They saw a girl who did it. We never did it. -I think it was a lie. -Sure. What's it name? What? Your show. It's embarrassing. Come on. Tell me. -You'll laugh. -Between colleagues? Smashing it. What? Smashing it. Well... It's alright. I wanted a one word title. Everything's like that now. It's like Homeland, Antiriot. -Poison. -Batman. Yes, that. -I don't know. -What is it about? Careful. You'll fall. Nah. We did this as children. -You'll fall. -You should try. No, thanks. The show was about freedom. The struggle of being a woman. The culture of success. The dictatorship of being better. Nice. The importance of the moment. The narcissism of postmodernism. And... Shit, I told you were gonna fall! Eva... Eva? Holy shit. On 25th at 12 pm. At the Princesa's offices. OK, I'm sorry. If I say nothing, you get mad. If I say something, you say I'm not empathic. What's empathy? You get mad for nothing. What can I do? Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Got confused. Can you take me to a bar? Now? -It's late. -So? I don't know you. Now you do. OK, hop in. Excuse me. Another one. You have... Here? It's weird, isn't it? I don't usually go drinking with random girls. Do you have a girlfriend? No. Boyfriend? No. What's your name? Manolo. It sounds old. Yes, I'm told that. You can call me Manu though. It's alright. Manolo's OK. And you are? Eva. What happened, Eva? I don't know. Anxiety. I'm new in Madrid. Everything looks new to me. I see. -No, you don't. -Yes, I do. In a few months I'm shooting a tv show. -Wow. -A tv show I wrote. -Cool. -Yes. Sounds good. It's about the narcissism of our time. And helplessness. And the negativity of female roles. I don't know. I don't know right not but I like it. I'm a programmer. IT Technician? -Yes. -Right. You're the only survivors of our generation. You must make a lot of money. I get by... Do you live alone? You ask a lot of questions. Sorry, still in shock. I'm only a lost girl from Palencia. Yes. You thought about it. No, well, I don't even know where I am anymore. You're fine though. I like it a lot, yes. Your job is far more interesting. -An artist. -Well, I wouldn't say that much. You get paid, right? Yes, they do now. That's all then. You're an artist. So that's what it was. -I didn't mean to be rude. -You weren't. I don't want to be a buzzkill but... I'm a bit dizzy. -Too bad. -Could you take me home? -Yes. -Really? -Sure. -Ok. The check, please. Can I get the check? Quickly, please. Bank card... I'm coming. Quickly, payment terminal. Eva... Eva... Eva. Eva? One moment. So... I just... Can I get your number? Very well. So chivalrous, Don Manolo. You can call me Manu. Nah, Manolo is fine. Write it down. Okay. 635... Shit, dad, you scared me. Your mom and I were awake. Sorry about the time. I started talking and... I got distracted. You're a big girl. What's wrong? Nothing. Why? You haven't had that glow in a while. You alright? Of course I am. You're shaking. Can I ask you a favor? -More money? -No. So let me be clear, as I like. One of these days... You'll get called. Just go with it. Who? The police. Holy shit. What have you done, Sabi? Did you kill anybody? Eva. -What? -Call me Eva from now on. You know what you're getting into? Are you with me on this? Do I have a choice? Let me tell you... -Hello, good morning. -Hello, good morning. I'm Eva Prieto. I had an appointment with Mr. Kibris at 12. May I see your ID? Sure. Here. OK, Eva. Mr. Kibris hasn't arrived yet. You may wait in the room. This way. -That way. -Yes. Mr. Kibris will see you in 5 minutes. -Coffee, juice, anything? -I'm fine. Sure, Ms Prieto? You know who I am? Sorry. You seem nervous. -Yes. -I can't see why. I loved "smashing it". From the content we chose is my favorite. Thanks very much. I'm a bit nervous. It's all new to me. I'm just a girl from Palencia. I thought you were from Puertollano. That's what I said. I don't know what I say anymore. You may come in. The office at the back. Don't worry. We won't eat you. I hope so. Courage, girl. She had great hair. Hair is important when writing a script. Yes. Look at me. Hello. Welcome to our little sanctuary. Please, have a seat. It's an honor. A pleasure. A pleasure and an honor. Did you change your hair? You look different from last meeting. -What meeting? -On Zoom. Well... I got coved twice. Three, actually. No, it's not that. Well, I wanted to talk about something. I don't know if it it's inconvenient but... I'd like to have the last version by email. I got a new laptop. I can't remember the last changes we made. I made. That's what Araceli's for. Our development manager and your right hand. In this process with "Smashing it". Nice to meet you. Introduce yourself, Araceli. Welcome, pal. Respect yourself a little bit. As I told you on Zoom. We really like your content. We want to start shooting. We want to start, Eva. September. What do you think? There's no time to lose so we must start the process. Adaptation... What process of adaptation? Relax, Eva. The usual. A marketing research. Work with algorithms. The subscribers. Their opinion is important. Let's admit it, Eva. Right now, some things don't work in "Smashing it". What doesn't work exactly? Dialogues, for example. The plot doesn't work. So everything. Everything. She got it. I like that... That spontaneity to admit it doesn't work. That's our job. To correct it. To adapt it. Hey, listen. Listen. An adaptation doesn't mean changes. Well, yes, it's a change. It's just that. A change, but anyway. It's our job and you're in good hands. Araceli's a pro. She'll help you. We'll become good friends. The tone. Araceli... The tone. As you say, Mr. Kibris. The first thing you need to know, Eva. We have the best advisors. Their reports are very important. Very important. And... careful. Careful. Don't get me wrong. We don't want to kill your creativity. No need to take every comment to the T. Just bear them in mind, alright? OK, what happens if I ignore them? We won't shoot it. That's that. To trash bin. Another one. Next. It's what it is. It's never happened to us, Eva. -Relax. -Why do you interrupt me? You cut the dynamic of the meeting. What do you intend? To be the new boss? Wanna sit here? Shall we vote? Araceli, new boss? Right? First thing is to introduce you to Morgan. The first advisor you'll listen to carefully. He's an expert in race's perspective. -Morgan, when you're ready. -Hi. Horrible. It makes no sense. Out of reality. Not even one racialized character. No Chinese in Spain? No blacks? No arabs? Does anyone know what I mean? -Anyone? -Clear, brother. -We get it. -Thanks. You know, Eva. Work, work. It's OK. You have to change the races. Half the characters are now black, Chinese... Hindu... another race. Portuguese... another race. Get it? That's your job. But it's fine because characters don't change. Only their race. Easy, Eva. We have an algorithm for that. Wow, nice. Let me introduce you to Amanda. Amanda is our expert in... in... In gender perspective. Feminism. What do you have to say, Amanda? I told you before, Mr. Quibris. Well, tell Eva. "Smashing it" has a negative assessment of 63%. 152 micro assaults in the bible. And 342 only in the pilot. Thanks, Amanda. Thank you. Well, you got some work there. Lots to do, Eva. A bit scary, to be honest. It's OK. Our content is not for cowards. Nor hypocrites. Let me introduce you to Denis. Our expert in disability and integration. And mental health. Alors... Welcoming... Welcumming... Wise words, Denis. You got lucky. It's a difficult minority. You save some work. If he hadn't liked, he would've jumped around... You would've noticed. He says there's nothing, there's nothing. That's what we understood. Well, this is Tato. -Hi. -Tato's homosexual. The LGT... LGTBIQ+ perspective. Isn't it? Any more letters added this week? Little jokes we have. Among minorities we respect. Your report, please. Sweetie, why? It was all very clear. 45% disagreement in the bible. And the pilot. Some representation is lacking. Exemplariness. And specially positive stereotypes. I didn't intend to make a show about the gay community. Excuse me. Sorry, we're all the gay community. Excuse me? I'm not. Not everyone. Everybody. Him, her, them. Their... Them. -Sometimes I... -It's OK. Tato, don't worry. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. -You're... -I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm... I'm fine. I'm fine. Moving on to the trans segment. Yurena. Where's she? She hasn't showed up. Again? I mean, Yurena... -She's hustling... -Poor girl. What you mean hustling? Do I have to explain it? Mmmm. No. So you're saying... Hang on. These stereotypes... -Transphobic! -Excuse me... We're not like that. What an impression you're giving. I'm not saying all trans hustle. I'm saying Yurena is hustling now. -You're one step out. -No, no. You're one step from being fired. We don't allow transphobia here. Careful, Eva. Listen. We don't allow transphobia and you have it deep in you. It can leak into our content. People can see it and imitate it. What do people do? Imitate fiction. That's what people do. You sure about that? No, we don't really have evidence. You might think I'm a jerk. But I have bosses who are bigger jerks. The microphones, Joaquin. I intended to do a show about my experience. I don't get why... what a gay, a disable, a feminist... and a racialized person think of my work is important. Excuse me, sweetie. I'm not gay. (unintelligible). I'm center right. Far right, for you. I am black though. See? We're not a charity. This is a business. We give people what they need. -So beautiful. -Yes. What you said, Araceli. That's what makes her being here worth it. These moments of reality. Sensitivity. This is our job. To make a better world. We're done here. Write it all down. I'd like to say something before finishing. Besides writer, I'm an actress. We'll talk about it. This is not paradise. You can't be an actress in a tv show like "Smashing it". Now, Araceli and you, get to work. Lots of work to do. Something great will come out. So let's get it. Alright, team? This is the beginning of something that... That will smash it. Smash it! Question. You mind saying you were a man? Never been a man. -Here comes the transphobia. -Hey, don't blame me. Bouncing, bouncing... and transphobia. Look... Well, it's OK. Relax, but at least in interviews say you're a vegan. Bisexual, a communist. You can say all that. An albino? Everything sounds good. I don't know why you don't look excited, babe. There's a lot to do. Right. We must plan everything. Sorry. Who's this? -I'll tell you later. -OK. Well, we're leaving. Come on. We have long week coding ahead. I want to stay. What did you say? Excuse Boris. Sometimes I don't know what's in his head. You were right, Manolo. Eva's great. I'm happy for her success. Well, success... Just got lucky. Whatever it was. Shut your mouth, idiot. You want another one? I think you're great, too. You're cool. Just some regular workers. What did you say? Workers in one of the most powerful companies in the world. Yes, that. One of the most powerful companies. I don't mean to brag but this one here... They want him bad in Mountain. I don't wanna go to Mountain. Again with that? Come on. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. -Bye, guys. -See you. Good luck. Damn, the IT technician. Such a temper. -Did you like these two? -Yes, a lot. They're funny. It's nice talking to people with a real job. Programmers are quite boring. Compared to the bohemians you deal with. Me a bohemian? Come on. I'm just a regular country girl from Puertollano. Wasn't it Palencia? I lied. Why? I don't know. I thought Puertollano was getting old around here. Palencia isn't? Maybe if you were from Murcia or Albacete. Well, I'm sorry. From now on, no more lies. -No. -Alright, Eva? Gotta go. Okay? I have a lot to do. I thought about dinner to celebrate about the show. Some other day, OK? Okay. Nice meeting you. I'm Araceli. Ooops. Nice to meet you. No, no. Get me a tequila or something. And later... (Babbling) Araceli, this is me. -Why? -Because it's my house. I don't get it. See you another day. Can't I go with you? No, it's late. -Eva, I promise... -Look, Araceli. Enough for today. Cool. I'll stay around here. Your choice. Shit, dad. Mom again? Relax, kid. It's just a couple of drinks I was... celebrating. Or in a funeral. What are you saying? Identifying your daughter's body is not something you do every day. Is that? They called you? Yes, I'm meeting up with them tomorrow morning. I'll stand before that poor girl's boday. And I'll say. Yes. She's my daughter. As if she was her. I just hope everything goes well. -But... -But? I told you, Sabi. Sooner or later... They'll find out. Or not. -It's my problem thought. -Yes. Well, let's have a toast to the old Sabina. Come on. She was... She was so pretty and so funny. If you don't mind... I'll spice things up a bit. I'll tell them you had an abusive boyfriend. They love that. No, no. Not a good idea. You kidding me? Aren't you a writer, actress and a bunch of other things? We need a believable story that touches people deeply. I don't like your dark tone. Don't you find all this dark and grotesque? Come on. Get a glass and let's have a toast. No, I'm going to bed. I'm tired. Fine. Eva. Dad. Thank you. Cheers, little star. In the end... You had it your way. I'll miss you, Sabina. Madwoman. Crazy head. Young woman found dead in Lucero has been identified. It's Sabina Marquez, 34 y.o. With less than 1,000 followers on Twitter. Sabina, you were my best friend. The best confidant you can have. You'll become an angel. Sabina. That's why... That's why these wings. These are your wings. These are your... -Wings. -Aww. "Sabina was like family." "I'll never forget how much she helped me". "How much I helped her". "The nights, the parties, the talks, the secrets. I love you, too. We never met. Amazing. What is she saying? This is amazing. So cute. I feel ashamed of people's stuff. Of people who do things. Of who doesn't do anything. I feel ashamed of anybody speaking. Of those staying quiet. For better or for worse. I feel ashamed of the banks. Of the ATMs. Of liquor stores. Of money. I feel ashamed of fences. I feel ashamed of walls. Of battles. Of medals. I feel ashamed of the future. I feel ashamed of the present. I feel ashamed of the past. Of the people. I feel ashamed of sports. Of transport. I feel ashamed of terrorism and the crusade against it. I feel ashamed of weapons. I feel ashamed of pacifism. I hate humans. I feel ashamed of myself. So Monolo and Yamil meet at the café. And they make out. Jamil with a J? With a Y, Araceli. With a Y, true. I spelled it wrong. Every time. Correct it. Alright. They meet at the cafe and make out. We have the racial storyline. And the homosexual one. That's half the show. Done. The they go home and make out. I don't know. A sex scene. Think about something. We're done for today. OK, I'll clean it up a bit later. And put it together. We're progressing a lot. Cool. I have to tell you something. I couldn't have done without you. So thank you. At the beginning... You thought I was lame, right? You read my mind. Not exactly lame. Well, a bit. I was very nervous that day. It happens to me often. Don't worry. I must confess something, too. Because I trust you. About me? No. I thought you were talented from the start. It's about Joaquin. I don't see him very confident about the project. I think he doesn't like you. You think so' Female intuition. No, I've seen weird things there. Projects being cancelled. Not due to lack of budget. The have money. Things you can't imagine. Excuse me. Are we interrupting? You've been there for 3 hours. Would like a cake with the beer? Cake and beer? My parents are peculiar. -We're leaving. -You're on my spot, bitch. -Sorry. -We're leaving. -I'm leaving. -Before you leave. Treat my girl well. She's excited and I like that. -Dad, please. -Well. Hey. Don't fuck with her. In my bedside table, I have... Not that story again. Let's go. Good evening. A pleasure as usual. Bye. Bye... What? You sure you don't wanna stay? Just remember the books you have to buy tomorrow. Yes, I got them. Hold on. Syd Field, McKee and Linda Shields. Right? -Save the cat, Blake Snyder. -Shit. -That's great. You always forget it. -I won't forget. -Shall I walk you home? -No, thanks. I'll stay here. Again? As many times it's needed. I appreciate you but you're a weirdo. I'm told that a lot. -See you tomorrow? -Yes. What's up, buddy? Long time no see! So bad, man. You might be confused. You're silly. I'm confused? You alright? Manolito, wake up. I wanted to see you. You know why? -Why? -'Cause you stood Xavi up. Xavi. True, yes. You know y on trial. So pay attention. The boss is on me. All the time. You know it. He won't take anything. I don't know why you do this. You call me and I take your shift. -I'll get on it. -Get on it. -OK? -I'll get on it. Who got you here? Papi did, right? Papi got you this. So don't fuck with me, man. -I won't. -Come on, man. -Gotta go. You seem busy. -Yes. -See you, princess. -Alright. -Bye. -Bye. -Get on it, man. -Yes, I will. He's such a good guy. Who's this fucking asshole? Someone from... I didn't know programmers had shifts. It's a new system from Norway. We don't get paid per project. It's per hour. They say productivity can multiply by 5 or 6. It's the latest in business marketing. You're not a programmer, are you? No. What are you, Manolo? Delivery man in Glovo. God. My name's not Manolo. -OK, Manu. Sorry. -No. Not Manu either. -What's your name? -John Snow. AS in Game of thrones? It's not even from your generation. Yes, I changed it. -You changed it voluntarily? -Yes. -I'm not Spanish. I'm Arab. -How are you Arab, Manolo? John Snow. I can be Arab if I want. Don't take my right to self-determination away. Sorry if I'm offending you. t's okay. -For God's sake. -There's something else. -I'm gay. -You can't be gay. You weren't gay with me. It's a matter of practice. Thanks. I'm not thanking you for anything. You're a fucking liar. Yes, yes. -Yes. -Lying to you was bad. -I'm sorry. -I need some time to take it all in. A few days. Weeks, months. I might need a couple of years. I understand. That's it? "I understand". -That's it? -I understand. I fucking trusted you. I trusted you, Manolo. John Snow. Bye. So cool. Look, it's the little liar. Let me go or I'll scream. Scream all you want. Nobody hears ghosts. Because you're dead. -Let me go. -Come on, let me see those boobs. Robert, I can see you. Stop. Shit! It was getting interesting. What's he doing? I'm gonna kill him. Let me go! Get inside. Leave me alone! Motherfucker. Motherfucker? Sorry, girl. We're broke. It's nothing personal. Nothing personal. You get it, right, love? Shut the fuck up and give me the tape. Don't be hard on her. Fucking shit. Hurry up. -Leave me alone! -Shut up! Fuck! Robert, what are you doing? -Hurry. -Give me the tape, please. Fucking shit! You didn't lock the doors! Can't you be faster? Come here, bitch. We can try some other time, babe. Don't be mad. Maica, we're not going to the movies, are we? Eva, you alright? Are you hurt? What are you doing here? I'm always here. It's my job. I don't usually have coffee. Me neither. It makes me nauseous. If I drink coffee, I vomit. Not that bad for me but my stomach feels funny. I'm a very active persona anyway. I'm not. I'd sleep all day if I could. I found other stimulant like working out. Sex... Cocaine. I heard a coffee is like 5 lines. It's worth it then. I like it black. It sounds racist though. Order a tea. It's relaxing. No, it's more stimulating than coffee. Sounds like an urban legend. No. They make it good here. Very hot. As if coming from Hell. I like it like that. Hot. I see. I can see you're going to tell me something important. For that reason, and for our friendship. I'll have a double coffee. I lied to you, Araceli. I lied everybody. Can't be that bad. My name's not Eva. -I'd better get a gin and tonic. -A vodka for me. So Maika and her stupid boyfriend are after me. -To sum up. -Son of a bitch. You didn't kill that girl? It's like I did. There's a big difference. Do you think I'm a bad person? -Am I a bad person? -No. You're not. You were just desperate. Thank you for being so understanding. Think about that girl. Her parents deserve to know the truth. They might be looking for her. I can't stop thinking about her. When we start the campaign for "Smashing it". You can use that name. You want to continue with the show? -Look. -Really? Listen, I look stupid but I'm not. I like looking like that. It's convenient. But I'm a professional. A professional knows when she's working with someone who says the script is hers. but is lying. You knew? I didn't know it. You couldn't know! I could imagined. -You knew nothing. -It's what I said about Joaquin Quibris. The way he looked. I saw things I didn't like. I didn't do anything. Maybe you couldn't. I stayed quiet and remained there. What did you see? Things. Tell me, what did you see? What's going there? Look... In this world everybody lies and trolls. True. People come with a script. We steal their idea. We give it to a famous face. Then we ruin that person or buy their silence. Shit. Sounds quiet dodgy. -Mafia. -So dodgy. Yes. If you wanna survive, you have to learn to shut up. And play dumb. You know what, Sabina? I'm tired of being naive. -Say it louder. -Yeah. You think being ambitious is bad? You get nowhere without ambition. You got lucky. -Well, I'm not sure. -You got lucky. -You're talented. I noticed. -Well... What do we do with Eva Prieto? -She's dead. There's no fixing that. -Nope. Don't be mean. You yourself said that... I can't use that name on the show. The show's gonna be aired. It's not your project or Eva's. 'Cause she's dead. It's our project. I'm on the tightrope. They'll get rid off me any time. What do you suggest? What do we do? -Easy. A pen name. -Another one? -Why not? -Where am I from now? -Puertollano? -Or Palencia? -Murcia. -No. What about Maika? Do we pay her? -A percentage or per episode? -No. I won't use my money for your crazy friends. If you give her money now, she'll ask for more. Don't do it. She'll get tired. Yes, easy. I'll pass. Chances come only once, my friend. Very well. Sure. That. Done then. -Easy. -Sure. Straightforward. You're not a writer, are you? It's funny you say that. Give me that. You've been a while... -It's out. -Give it to me. Light it up. Hey, you. Yes, you. Do you think all platforms are the same? No. In Movierama we work on our own content. For you to feel safe. Also, we're advocates for... carbon print, environmentalism, feminism, social inclusion. And... veganism. Careful. We're also anticapitalist. Everything at the best rate in the market. With our promotion Lurque. You can access all our catalogue. By paying only 10%. On the condition you can't access our movies or shows. We'll teach you to live. We'll teach you to think. Everything from a... LGT... LTG... LTG are hamburgers, right? How was it? We fight to make a better world. We reject any kind of... Stereotypes based on darker races. Sick people or women. I'm a woman and can't do anything. Can't do laundry. Ironing. I don't like sex. I don't like work. I'm not even a romantic. Don't want to be a mom. Don't want to be a wife or a daughter. What I like is doing nothing. Being as useless as any man. I'm a racialized person and don't smell bad. I don't smoke marihuana or crack. I have no guns at home. I don't have a disproportionate dick. Over 200 sponsors, brands and charities back Movierama's experience. Suscribe. You have nothing to lose. Well, yes. Your money. We got it! For fuck's sake! The whole fucking morning wasted with this shit. Mr. Quibris, we must talk. -Talk about what? -"Smashing it". -"Smashing it". -The show, Mr. Quibris. Oh, yes. I read what you sent me. -Crap. -Crap? Crap. It smells bad. I don't like it. No, it lost all originality. All intelligence and spontaneity it had. Rubbish. We were trying to give an honest touch. -Human. -Honest? We don't work with honesty. We work with lies. Humanity? We don't work with that either. Dreams. We work with lies and dreams here. Get it? Lies and dreams. You didn't get it so you'd better leave. We wasted our time with you. We gave you a chance and you wasted it. -Aren't you going to pay me? -Pay for what? -What you owe me. -What do I owe you? I owe you nothing. We gave you an advance. You deserve nothing for what you've done. In fact, we might shoot the show. But you won't be the writer. I'll hire Red Sky's writer. What do you think? He'll be better. 'Cause you didn't get it. Will we mention you in acknowledgements? Maybe If you wanna fight, we'll fight. We have the best lawyers. They had cases with Inditex. Telepizza, Victoria Abril. Go fuck yourself. I wish. Bye, bye, girl. - ...... -Asshole. You didn't like her, did you? What? Araceli, think about it. It seems... It seems it's not like that but I like you. As a person and as a professional. As a writer. I think you're good. Shit, Joaquin. I thought you were an idiot. An idiot? A dickhead. No. In this world there are two ways. Either you go with the trend or you listen to me. If you listen to me, you'll be on top. Think about it. This fucking glass generation. Sabi, wait. I'm coming with you. No. Don't be an idiot. Go back. Go. I can't do this anymore. You're a writer. This is your place. Araceli, I'm just a fraud. Don't say that, Sabina. What do you want me to say? You don't deserve this. Since when do we get what we deserve? I didn't want it to end like this. Thank you. Truly. That's it. I'm done. Wait, Sabina. What's wrong? You have a visitor. A visitor? I'm afraid it's not good news. -Babe. -What? -Do I have anything? -No. Behave yourself, Robert. Leave me. I know how coke affects you. Well, well. -Hey, darling. -What's up? I must admit you know how to get us begging. I was going to tell you. -But after... -Sabi, I don't care what you say. We know you killed Eva to get her contract with Movierama. -Shame. -No, I didn't kill her. She fell. I didn't do anything. Why don't you pretend you fall and suck my dick? -Just like that. -Robert, control yourself. We don't care if you killed that dumb bitch. We know you did it to get some money. We've been after you. You know there's no show then. Cancelled. There's no money. -Want to get your face fucked? -Robert! -Fuck. -Tell that to someone who cares. Better. Sit down. We don't believe some liar's fantasies. Eva told us she was getting paid a lot of money. Where's the money? Maica, there's no show. It's cancelled. I'm fired. Want a drawing? Sure. You did all this for nothing. -Don't believe you. -Listen. Listen. This is the thing. You're giving us half of what you got for the script. And the same for what you get from royalties or whatever. It's only fair. Think about poor Eva. SHe was our friend. You don't give a shit about Eva. You do, nun of charity? Don't forget you killed her and you're stealing from her now. -I care more than you do. -Even more important. My girl wants a part in the show. Instagram is getting small for her. _I want a writing position. -Noted. It doesn't have to be coordinating. Just important enough to leave my touch. Your touch. Sure, here you are. -With invisible ink because... -You laughing at me, clown? Give us the fucking money or we'll speak. Even if you didn't kill that pretty face. You can get charged for identity theft. I know the law. Got friends in the sewers. I'm a journalist. Not to mention all those nice messages you received online. Sweet Sabina turned into a psycho, a liar. There's no money, no show. It's cancelled. Why do you make it so difficult? I expected it from this idiot, but not from you. -Because we're friend. -Are we? I thought you were a good person but you're a pest. -You're not better, honey. -I don't care. Stop with the fucking theatre! Give us the fucking money! Tell your stupid boyfriend there's no money. Who are they? Why are they shouting? A bunch of idiots. You heard them or is it just me? Me too. But they're leaving. They're leaving. We know it from Eva. Do you get money for having retards in your family? Shit! Son of a bitch! Fucking old man. -Drop the fucking gun. -Alright, alright. Fucking shit! -Move! -Babe! Dad, dad, dad. Help me, please. Don't move. Come one, fucking bitch! Shoot me in the face. You want to! It's what you need to be the fucking prom queen! Fucking bitch. -Dad. -Honey, honey. Sabi... Please, please, please. Three months later. You're the last person I expected. I hope you're not mad at me. No. How can I be mad? Sorry about what happened. Specially about your father. I'll have to learn to live with it I guess. Don't blame yourself. I don't. Look, I don't know how the procedure goes. I know your friend's lawyers are complicating everything. Revealing what went with Eva wasn't nice. I just want to prove I didn't kill her. I did kill Robert. I'd do it again. But not Eva. Saying that is not good for you. Who cares... -Sorry if I harmed you in any way. -Me? You silly. No matter how ugly, news are free promotion. True. You alright, Sabina? Yes. As good as I can. I'm worried about my mom. You have a good lawyer? I got one but he's not good. What about this? We wanna help. What you mean "we"? He's an expert in shit like this. Call him. It's on us. Not sure I follow. It's the other thing I wanted to tell you. We're re-launching "Smashing it". It's the right time. -I'm not in the mood to write, Araceli. -I will. Look. They tripled the budget. Joaquin agrees. I have carte blanche. I'll tell your story, your way. Not sure it's a good idea. Listen. What happened to you represents many people. We just need your permission. What do you call when your plan goes backwards? Life. The best you can do is to sign. It's all clear. Specially the money. For you and your mom. -I didn't want it to end like this. -Listen, Sabina. You have to be ambitious. I'm here because of that. Look. If you could choose... How would you like to be remembered? As the director of Amy Winehouse's documentary or Amy herself? The director of Tiger King or the fucking Tiger King? Ok... As Michael Jackson's biographer or fucking Michael Jackson himself? OK. Clear, straightforward. The right words. Are you a troublemaker? It's funny you say that. Pen. The first episode of "Smashing it: Sabina Marquez' forbidden dream" was aired eight months later. Despite the platform refusing to show the actual figures, The premiere had a minimum repercussion and barely created a debate online. It was such a failure that Movierama cancelled it and no more episodes were aired. Weeks later, Movierama was bought by Disney and everyone got fired. Joaquin Kibris was taken to court, accused of encouraging toxic behavior in the company. Currently, Araceli is a cashier in Supermarkets Dia. She never work for the big (or small) screen again. Sabina Marquez was released without charges thanks to Movierama. She lives with her mother now. She also stopped writing.
