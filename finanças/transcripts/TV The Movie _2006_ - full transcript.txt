I think he probably feels powerful with you, 'cause you're Jesus. Hello, America, welcome to the new reality show... Okay, Max, pick your race card. - ( exhales ) - Come on, honey. Okay. Come on. Sweden. Oh, pigmy tribe. - Boy, are you in for a treat. - Man. At least you didn't get France. When they first told me I was going to Africa, I didn't-- I didn't know what to expect. I was kind of scared. You know, I-- I barely been out of Van Nuys. Don't cross the 405. You know? Ah, what's for dinner? Um... uh-- oh. Ah... Yum, yum, yum. Dinner. Mmm. I figured what the heck?

You know it's been a little difficult trying to, uh, adjust to Mabutoo's ways. ( groans ) But, you know I-- I-- he-- he's from Africa, and-- and Africa is, ya know, it-- it-- it-- it's not like it's Van Nuys or something. They just do stuff different. A lot of their customs were strange, but, uh... I just went with it, ya know, when in Rome. ( disco music playing ) Announcer: It's &quot;Girls Gone Bonkers.&quot; The most offensive footage ever illegally attained from mental institutions around the world.

And what did you bring me back? Nada. Nothing. What happened? Well, first of all, I let her drive. Which was a mistake. She can't parallel park for shit. - I fire you! - Me? I hate snitches, never snitch on your friend. Why me? I've got potential! She can't park! She can't park! ( mariachi music playing ) Uh, things are actually getting a lot easier. Mabutoo is actually really nice. He's a really nice pigmy. And-- and Teddy is really taking a liking to him. I-- I think that Mabutoo has made his school life a lot easier. ( period bell rings ) Hey, Gottlieb, you little bitch, give me your lunch. ( thud ) ( bongos playing ) ( Mabutoo chanting ) I-- I'm sorry. I am just been so upset since my little Mr. Whimpers went lost. Look, isn't he handsome? Things are kind getting a little strange. ( blabbering ) I think that he might want to have sex tonight.

In Russia, pussy's so cold, come frozen on stick. - ( cheerful music playing ) - ( flies buzzing ) What the fuck is that smell? Good God, that rotten meat could gag a maggot. Sometimes you can be so rude. You know I gave birth to 5,000 maggots this morning. ( husky buzzing noise ) I just found a huge pile of dog shit. Hey girl. What up, T-rex? - ( gas, burp, splat ) - ( loud slurp ) Wow, where's that pile of shit at? Hi, I'm Jimmy Gonzales, standing here live in front of Senator Webster's residence. Where we are waiting the arrival of Senator Webster and hopefully he'll be answering the questions concerning the allegations of his drinking and womanizing. ( brakes screech ) Ed, follow me.

Go on, Jose, get her! - ( screaming ) - ( Jose yelling in Spanish ) ( gunfire ) Announcer: John Boston. - Car salesman. - ( monitor beeping ) A man still barely alive. Gentlemen, we can't rebuild him. We don't have the technology. We don't have the capability to do a damn thing with him. John Boston is that man. We can't make him stronger, faster, for damn sure... younger. ( the &quot;Six Million Dollar Man&quot; theme playing ) Yes.

Hello, a camper, who was actually camping brought us this next doozy of a story that I found so compelling, I had to go down and investigate it further. All by myself. In the swamps of Florida, we found what looked like an ogre. A real live ogre. Or what appeared to be an ogre that looked like another ogre that's famous. We followed him, for several days. Through the swamps. This is the interview, raw and uncut. Hey! Hey! Hey! Cut! Cut! Sadly, our interview ended, and I had to leave, but we'll fondly remember our little friend in the swamp. I know I will. That was-- that was an amazing interview. I'm Jeffery Sutton, masturbation trainer. You may know me from my popular line of training tapes available only on the internet, television, and through some gentlemen's magazines. Well, now there's a new way to learn my time-tested techniques. Jeffery Sutton's masturbation training camp. That's right. Uh-huh! I'll run you through a rigorous course that will not only train your body, but most importantly, your precious hands. Act now, and the first 100 callers will receive this handsome Jeffery Sutton t-shirt. Well, kids, we have a very special treat for you. Today, a famous scientist is gonna come into the classroom and talk to us about alligators. Got you. Nobody here's afraid of alligators, are they? You are? Well, I'm not afraid of alligators. If I'm not afraid, you don't have to be afraid. You just have to be brave. So, not to worry, we're just gonna see some photographs. ( roaring, children screaming ) But you said you were gonna talk to it... Hands on is the best way to learn. What about safety? Safety's not an issue. I have it all under control. ( roars ) All right, kids, we're gonna have a little demonstration, and Manny has assured me that everything is perfectly safe. This is a handfeed. ( screaming ) Don't freak out. Calm down. You have a considerable flesh wound. ( screaming continues ) Today we've learned that the alligator is very impressive. When I launch this missile at the moon, I'll prove to the world that I'm king of the madmen. Sir, that's absolutely ridiculous. Why would you want to launch the missile at the moon? Einstein, you're an idiot. It's the middle of the day. The moon won't be out for hours. It's a slow missile, you ignorant moron. Just launch it. - Thirty seconds to launch. - Oh, man. - XXXL, you son of a bitch. - I got you, Lankin. You're own your own, puppy. Fifteen seconds to launch. Hey, hey, hey, what the hell do you want? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something, motherfucker? I don't know what to do. I'm in a jam. I've got fifteen seconds to stop this missile from being launched. I need a pass key to get into their system. Motherfucker, use the force. What is that, magic? No, motherfucker. Force something into the console. What are you, stupid, Fat Joe? What's wrong, is you dirty? Jeez. Go on and handle this, man. I gotta finish what I'm doing. God damn it. Shit! The suit! The suit! The suit! Damn, you're squashing me. You're squashing me. Yeah, dude, it's time, isn't it? Time for you to admit that your dick is so fucked up with herpes that you won't even show it to your own wife. Let alone cheat on her with it. You're not gonna go anywhere near a doctor's office, because they might tell you how fucked up your dick really is. Chill out, dude. It's mellow. I got the Extendo-Dong-brand penis concealer. And enhancer. Come in for a fitting, and enjoy your dick the way it used to look. Except longer, firmer, and girthier. Fuck your way back to the top of your relationship and all the side bitches. Sure, you gave your wife and a few bitches herpes. But now you can give back. Extendo Dong. Fuck 'em all. ( duck squeaks ) I can smell the great outdoors and the open range. It's great here. But there's been some development. Hey, stranger. Better watch for Indians and rattle snakes. Shut up, you old coot. We know you gotta save your money. Nobody knows that better than a cowboy. That's why we at the Black Angus cattle restaurant are bringing you the big beef burger sandwich. Oh, yes, it's raining beef. It's a fat-ass woman burger. And it's burger-licious. - Oh, your beef is so big. - Thank you, darling. What do they call a taco in France? Well, a taco is just a taco, but they call it &quot;le taco.&quot; - Le taco? - Le taco. Le taco, le taco. Le taco. What do they call a burrito in France, world traveler? ( speaks Spanish ) Le burrito, guey. Everything is &quot;le.&quot; Everything is &quot;le.&quot; Le burrito. ( both speak Spanish ) - I'm horny. - You horny? - I'm horny too. - You horny too? - Oh, look, a hooker. - Hey, mami. ( speaks Spanish ) My partner here-- ( speaks Spanish ) Get in the back. Oh, I'm gonna handcuff you inside, chica. - I can watch, no? - Oh, shit! She's a man. She's a man! She has a sausage, like Tommy Lee. Kick her out. Should I kick her out? Uh, she's kinda cute. Okay. Okay, you be with me. All right. ( dramatic music plays ) When my brother first started partying with children for a living, we were all very proud of him. But then, it was more about the party and less about the children. Kids are ready. They're outside. Ah. Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. He's a great clown, - At your service. - but a bad person. ( thud ) God damn it. These kids are gonna have the time of their fucking lives. We've had cameras following him around, and it's totally time to intervene, dude. I mean, I'll level with you. Some kids piss me off. ( carnival music plays, children scream ) That's a good-looking cake. Want some? ( children scream ) Yeah, smoking rules. That's my animal! I call it Mr. Cock And Balls. ( laughs ) Yeah. Whoo! ( children scream ) Hell, the occasional parents interfered with my performance. Do you believe that fucking clown? What the fuck are you doing? That's my wife! Oh, you don't you even think about cock-blocking me! Most of time, I just have a fucking blast. - Party! Party! - ( glass breaking ) Mommy. Can I offer anybody a cigarette? Ah, damn it. ( sniffs ) Plus I act as my own agent, so drug testing's no problem. Ah, much better. Oh, yeah. Yeah. All right. I'm back, kids. I'll tell ya, back when I was in clown college, I was at the top of my class. ( carnival music continues ) Yeah, there's some clowns that have problems. See that a lot in the circus community. I know exactly what I'm doing. ( fly buzzing ) Hey, hey. What kind of twisted party clown are you? I'm not paying for you. Get out of my house. ( glass breaks ) What are you-- ? What the-- ? ( children scream ) I just wanna make people happy! You ungrateful piece of shit. I'm gonna call the cops if I don't get my money. My brother thinks he's going to another kids' party. But it's actually an intervention. He probably won't know the difference, but it's time to stop, Steve-O. Enough is enough, dude. And hopefully this is the last party you'll ever go to. Yeah, dude. Thanks for being here. Thank you. I'd like to thank you all for being here. It's nice to see that Steve-O's got such supportive friends and family members. I'd say Steve-O is one lucky clown. Now, he thinks he's coming here for a birthday party. When he gets here, he might be in destructive mode, so nobody do anything to agitate him. Hmm? Remind him that we're here to help him. ( bike horn honks, thud ) I had that. Shit. I heard about a birthday party. Steve-O, it's me, your brother. Yeah, sweet. Let's get wasted. Not today, bro. Not today. I think you know why we're all here. Yeah, we're here to fucking party! No, that's not why we're here, Steve-O. What are you talking about? Just relax. Hey, good to see you. ( laughing ) Yeah. Oh. Oh. Haven't done ecstasy in days. Steve-O, I'm an interventionist. Yeah, I should probably only take three, right? You're family is worried about you. Oh, yeah? My family? Fuck my family. Fuck you! Fuck my family, and fuck you too! So where are the fucking kids, man? I'm ready to fucking party. Doesn't look like a fucking party to me. The kids aren't coming today, Steve-O. Kid-- I'm still getting fucking paid, right? Sure. Yeah, sweet. ( laughing ) Whoo! - Steve-O, dude. - What? - Please. - What? Enough is enough, dude. Oh, no. Fuck. Fuck! God damn it. Now I'm really fucking pissed. - Steve-O, you need help. - Fuck! Steve-O, I think that even you can see that you have a problem. Yeah, you're about to have a fucking problem, asshole. I'm gonna fucking light your face on fire. Oh, it's not safe carrying a candle that's lit and lighter fluid. Yeah, well, it's not safe telling me not to fucking party. ( heavy metal music plays ) Woman: Part of the job. Come on. Good day's work. Come on. Come on. Come on! - Be gentle with me. - Okay, okay. I said stop! In the name of the law. La, la, la, la, la, la, la. Cocaine and bitches! Yeah! Push the end of the booby so you can see them better. Extra bonus. Surprise, some tits. That's right. We'll, obviously, you daft cunt. Hey, I didn't say &quot;motherfucker&quot; yet, God damn it. My contract says I get to say &quot;motherfucker&quot; at least seven times. All you white motherfuckers, give me the chance to say &quot;motherfucker.&quot; That's a lot of shit-- I got to-- ( cheering ) Cut! It's underground, but many people enjoy masturbation time. That's all the water I got in me. ( belches ) Chimichanga, cabron. Yeah, it's gonna get a little bit snowy in hell tonight. Uh, um, it's not my fault... - ( laughing ) - That was terrible. That took me by surprise. ( laughs ) ( clears throat ) There's, like, a fly over here. Do it like Daddy. Swing to the left, swing to the right.
