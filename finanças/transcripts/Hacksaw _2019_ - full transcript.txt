We good. Hold up. Well take your sweet fucking time, honey. Today! Almost. How do my teeth look? You look good. Good? They're perfect. Well that's what I want to hear. If you take one more damn minute! Ready. Good. I'm Max Hart, here live to give you a first look at the building where everything took place. For years, this city has been trying to tear down this building. And now, finally, right before Christmas, folks, we're getting a little present early this year. With news that was just released today, the tear down to this building will begin the day after Christmas, finally, putting to rest the horrible past. But what really happened here? Is the legend true about this Ed Crow? The man who killed over 300 people in this building. Men, women, children, all killed by his hacksaw. Or was it all made up? This once former hospital has still yet to release any documents confirming whether or not this man, Ed Crow, in fact worked here. Or was it a game of copycat? Said people taking this thing a little too far, wackos who call themselves the followers of Ed Crow? When we come back, I'll be live with a man who believes the legend is true. A brother to one of the victims who was last seen near this building just last October. When we come back, I'll be live with Richard Hill on The Hart Show. Good. That look good? It was great. My teeth, they look good? Yeah, they're good. That's not what I want to hear, dick. They're perfect. My man. Are you recording? No, I'm not recording. Asshole! Ow, are you gonna help me pack or what? No, I'm taking a shower. Get over here, come and help me pack. Come on. This is how I need a shower to get on the road. Thank you. Hey babe, if you watch this or when you watch this, I just wanted to say thank you. What could've been an easy plane ride back home has turned into a two day road trip because someone thought it would be a good idea. So thank you. I love you. And thanks for helping me pack. Oh, one other thing I want to add, when we get married and have kids, you're helping out, okay? I'm not gonna be your fucking slave. Just wanted you to know that. Oh, and I get dibs on naming the first kid. Knowing you you're going to want to call him Sky or Friday or Apple or some stupid fucking celebrity kid name. So, uh-uh, first dibs and you're not smoking anymore, I've decided. What up, bee-otch? - What's wrong? - I'm engaged. Oh my god! Oh, I'm gonna get Mom. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Please don't get Mom. - Okay, why? Because we're headed there. It's a surprise. - Oh really? - Yes. What time are you guys flying out? Well, we're driving. - Who's stupid idea was that? - Mine. Please promise? Whatever, just don't take forever to get here, okay? Teryn, promise me you're not gonna tell Mom. Teryn? I promise, I promise, I won't say anything. Okay, well, we got to get on the road to head your way, okay? I'll see you soon. - Bye, bitch. - Love you. I'm driving. I'm driving. Come on. I'm driving. Whatever, man. Love you. Whatever. I told Teryn. You what? I told Teryn. Why would you do that? Why would you tell her? Why would you tell her? 'Cause she's my sister. She's gonna tell your Mom. She's gonna tell your Mom. No, she's not. Well, just don't be surprised when we get there and your Mom already knows. She won't. So we're taking the 26 to get there? Nope. Why? Because I thought we could take the scenic route for once. You know it's gonna take a lot longer to get there. No, it won't. - It will. - Not. - It will. - Not. - Mm-hm, it will. - Not. - It will. - Not. - It will. - Not. - Will. - Not. - Will. - Not. Stop it! Are we going, let's go! - Stop. - Come on! And we're off. Are you recording right now? Yes, Ash, yes, I am recording you right now. Well stop, I don't look good right now. I disagree, babe. I think you look pretty fucking foxy right now. Oh my god. So just own it, alright? Let me see it, come on. Let's see those beautiful lips of yours, come on. - I said no, stop. - Come on, let me get a close up. I'm gonna pinch your titty. Quit it dick, I'm driving. - Babe, I... - Don't. I really need to go to the bathroom right now. Well, hold it. Babe, I really, really need - to go to the bathroom right now. - Hold it! Okay, I really, really need to go to the bathroom right now. You want me to hold it? Are you serious right now? Okay, I'm gonna get a kidney stone, all right? There's a gas station coming up, all right, and I just really need to go to the bathroom! Well, if Christmas wasn't enough on your mind, it looks like winter is going to be a little off this year. Record high temperatures reaching well over in the mid-high one hundreds. Jesus fucking Christ. Guys, this is DJ Cassidy... Did you get me a drink? What, no. Did you get me a drink? You didn't say you wanted to drink. I want a soda. All right, thanks for telling me now, okay. And jalapeno chips. Soda and jalapeno chips. Yeah, since I'm here. Babe, I really don't wanna go back inside there. Please babe? You're really gonna make me go back in there, huh? For your fucking jalapeno chips? Jalapeno chips, my favorite. You're gonna make me do this? Yeah, yeah, I'm starving. Are you sure? Hurry up, gotta go! Now how long was she gone before you and your family noticed something was off? After we realized she hadn't contacted us for two days, we contacted the police. And did the police do anything? Yeah, they filed a police report and said they do their best to find her. Their best. Now, how do you feel now that this building is being torn down? Absolutely nothing. It feels great. But it's not gonna bring my sister back. How long has it been since your sister's disappearance? She didn't disappear. That fucker got her. We can't cuss live. I'm sorry. So what do you feel really happened? It's really obvious. The whole city knows he still lives there. Somewhere. He as in Ed Crow? Ed Hacksaw Crow. He killed my little sister. Do you feel that your little sister is still in this building? Fucking a, I do. Sorry, yes I do. I believe he fucking killed her and all these fucking followers that follow him like some fucking cult helped him fucking kidnap her. Now if you, Richard Hill, could do anything to this man, if you could say anything to this man in front of millions of watchers in this world, what would you say? The camera's right there, what would you say? I wouldn't say anything. You wouldn't? I would do to him what he did to my sister. Okay. I'd cut him up with his own fucking hacksaw! Okay, that's it. Okay, that's it. The people here need to know the truth. They think he's dead or never existed, but I know the truth. He's fucking real and all of his followers, they're all fucking in on it. - Stop recording, dumbass! - Sorry. There's a fucking kid out here. - They're all in on it. - Stop recording, dumbass. They help him take people and they fucking kill, don't touch me, you fucking prick! Hey, this is my show. I don't give a shit. People need to know, they need to know the truth. People are dying in here. They're tearing down this building after Christmas, - you know this! - That's not gonna stop him! That's not gonna, he's not going to go away. Okay, okay, that's it. This interview is over. You can't fucking kill him. You can't fucking kill evil! You can't... That is gonna get old really fast. Come on, babe. I just got the fucking camera. I'm experimenting with the settings. I'm just getting used to it. I'm trying to figure it out. Come on, just stop being a fucking Grinch, alright? Come on. I'm not a Grinch, I just don't like the way I look right now for you to be recording me. You know I love you stuffing in your mouth like that. You know how I love to see you stuffing your mouth. With chips, with chips, come on. Hey, I was listening to that. Not the best thing to hear before Christmas, guys, but the city's mayor has issued a statement today that the building on 21st and Grape will in fact be torn down right after Christmas. I know it doesn't bring back your loved ones, but it certainly eliminates that horrible place from ever standing tall in this fine city of ours. So finally the home to the most notorious murderer in history, Ed Crow, will be gone forever. Now back to something a little more cheerful, huh? I'm going to play one more song before I head out and Mandy comes in and covers the next round. That's right, your local favorite Mandy. I'm heading off on vacation for two weeks, but Mandy will be in to cover for me and make sure we pay the bills around here, 'cause somebody's got to do it. But first, this next song for all my first time couples out there, during the best time of the year. That's right, I'm your favorite, DJ Cassidy, and this is your favorite station to listen to on the road, while at work, live all day at HC Radio. We're so going. No, we are not going. Nope, we're going. It's fucking insane. It's fucking, it's gonna be fun. They're gonna tear it down soon. It's really fucking cool. Come on, I can get all the footage on my camera. It's gonna be sick. Are you deaf, I said no and they said the building was sealed off... No, they said they're tearing it down after Christmas. Okay, it's gonna be gone soon. - No. - Why? Why, why? - We're not going? - Why? Well, one, we have to get to my parents and tell them the big news. And two, I'm not running around in some building where some shit went down. - Ashley? - Don't. - Ashley? - It's not gonna work, Tommy. Heart crushed. That's what this supposed legend, Ed Crow, has done to folks in this glory sick. I'll just like, did you get that? Hurt, crushed, that's what this legend, Ed Crow, has done to folks in his glories. I would just like to take the time to thank Mr. Richard Hill for coming on The Hart Show. Your family will have justice. Your family will be happy once again. Thank you for coming on The Hart Show, Mr. Hill. This building that I'm standing next to will be torn down to absolutely nothing, down to the fucking ground. Excuse me. Pavement, it's flat pavement, turned into a parking lot. I'm sorry, just, it hurts me terribly when good, hardworking Americans like Mr. Hill have to suffer like this. Hey, come here. Now, if there is an Ed Crow, if there is the supposed followers of Ed Crow out there, you hear this, we're coming for you. And the light's about to shine on you, if you're still in there. And cockroaches run out when the light's on. So be ready. Cause we're coming in, we're going to tear this whole goddamn thing down on your faces. I'm Max Hart and this is The Hart Show. Till this time after Christmas, we'll be here, live, when we bring down this motherfucker to the ground. And who fucking is talking across the goddamn street during my video. 'Cause your dick is so small, little dick. He could see my dick all the way from here. What the fuck are you saying? It's over, done. Right now it's done? It's done when I say it's done, this is The Hart Show. Oh, we got to wrap up now, I'm Max Hart, we're going to see you this time after Christmas, when we tear this motherfucker to the ground. So are you gonna ignore me all night? What? Are you gonna ignore me all night? No, I'm not ignoring you at all. Okay, let's go. Go where? You know where. What, now? No idiot, tomorrow. But I thought you didn't wanna go to the building. Well, I mean the road trip was my idea so I feel bad. We really don't have to go if you don't wanna go. Really, it's fine. It's fine, it's okay. You really want to go, so let's go. Do you still want to go? Fuck yeah, I still wanna go. It's not that far from your Mom's anyway so it's probably about at least an hour out. I did like the road trip, it was fun. I did get to get some things on my camera, so, but would've got there a lot faster if we took a plane. That's just me, all right, I mean, hey, I'm not pointing any fingers at anybody, but you know, still love you, babe. Well, we wouldn't be able to do this anyways in the future, we're gonna be pretty busy. Busy. Yeah, when we have kids. Busy, uh-huh, as in, you do know that just because you have a kid doesn't mean you can't go anywhere. You can still do things. People go to a lot of places with their kids. But it's a lot harder. Yeah, it's a little harder, but we'll make it work. Kids as in more than one? That's usually what that means? Well let's just see how it goes with one, okay? If I can keep something alive for longer than a year, then we can talk. Nope. I'm not having five kids. Never said we're having five kids. Or four. One is good. One is good. So did you tell your Dad? What was that? Did you tell your Dad? What, about us? - Yeah. - I did. And how did it go? All right, that's all that matters, but yeah, I don't talk to him like you talked to your parents, okay? Doesn't really matter what he said or what he thought, okay? Guys, we don't really talk about our feelings. You two need to work out whatever it is that's going on. Me and Dad, we're really not the talking type. So you know this already, so, okay. I'll try. I really will, I'll try. Our kids are gonna know who their grandfather is. Okay. I'll try. I really will, I'll try. Are you gonna be on that camera all night or... Why? Because it's either going to be me or the camera. Yeah, is that a trick question? This is stupid. We look like a bunch of jackasses standing in front of this building. Looks like a full human bladder exploded all over the wall. It looks like the bathroom when you don't clean it, honey. Cute! Are you sure about this? It's probably all made up bullshit anyways. Hey honey, after we get married, do you think maybe we could move into a house like this one? Oh, that's lovely, look at those windows. Oh man, this is perfect. We don't even have to, yeah, it doesn't even need any touching up or anything. This is ready, babe, right? Hey, you can raise your five kids here. They each get a floor, look at that. Hey, you can raise your five kids here, honey. Isn't this nice? They can come out here and pee on the wall too, add a little art to the wall, you know, potty train them. Yeah, it'd be fun. Stairs, stairs, stairs, we got stairs, babe. Alright, just hop over there, climb up the stairs. Come on, babe, babe, babe, hop over the fence and climb up the stairs. Come on, hop over the fence, climb up the stairs. We're leaving. Leaving, we just got here. Well I'm not waiting forever and I wanna go. You wanted to drive back home. You said it wouldn't rain, it did. Who said it wouldn't rain? It wasn't that bad. Yeah, right. But it is pretty though, right? No, it's not pretty. It's fucking raining it's fucking ugly. Who are you, Robert Smith? The pictures of the raindrops are beautiful. Fucking girls. Oh, now you like to take the, oh yeah, now you like the camera, oh, now we're taking pictures, oh, now that it's raining outside. It's so beautiful. We stopped because you wanted to take pictures. Having fun getting your pictures? Yes. Very nice, very nice, honey. Very Texas Chainsaw. Maybe you can post that one on your Instagram or something. You would. There's so much junk everywhere. Are we gonna do something that I want to do yet? Well, yeah, and? Yeah, I get shit 'cause I wanna stop somewhere, but oh, Ashley wants to stop. Oh yeah, of course. There's a pizza parlor down the street around the corner. So I'm going to eat, you have fun. Eat, where are you going? Bye. This place is gonna be gone soon, all right, come on! Fuck, god damn it. It's right there. Right there, I can see it. That's the fucking way in. We just gotta just crawl the fuck under, go up that ladder, that that's the way in right there. Shit, fuck. Ah, shit, fuck, fuck, shit. Hey, can you order me something? Hey, did you get inside or? No, I did not find a way inside the building. Can you order me something, please? Yeah, I'm fine. If you could please order me something, I'm actually really hungry, please. Yeah, that's fine, you know me, - pepperoni, mushroom... - What are you doing? Holy fucking shit, what the fuck, man? What's your problem, man? Yeah, I know that. So what do you do? None of your fucking business, man. Yeah and stop following me. Fucking asshole. There's no coming out again. I know the way inside! Yeah, I'm listening. - 50! - What? - $50. - $50? I know a way in. Okay, that's great. Look, all I have is a 20, okay? I don't have a 50, so if you know a way. Sold! Oh, so we're going now? Look Ashley, Ashley, I got a way inside. Someone's gonna help me inside the building. I know you ordered the food, just hold onto it. I found a way inside the building. No, you can stay there and eat but I'm going inside the building. You coming? No, no, I'm not. No, I'm not. You eat the food, I know you got it for me. I'll eat it later, all right? There's a guy right now who's gonna take me in, okay? What do you know about this place? Just a guy named Ed Crow used to work in this hospital, killed a bunch of people. And that people, he had some, I dunno, he had some sort of a cult thing. I just heard about it on the radio. And you still want to go down in there? It's all just made up bullshit, dude. There's no such thing as Ed Crow. Okay, maybe someone got hurt a long time ago, but it's bullshit. What is this, man? I paid you, dude. You're just gonna stand there or you gonna show me in? This is as far as I go. Everything you want is through that door. I already tried that door already, man, and the other one and they're all fucking locked. Is there even? Hey man, what, this isn't cool. What the hell? Where the fuck did he go? Fucking asshole took my money. The door is locked. Where are you? Honey, down here. Tommy, I can barely see shit. Keep walking down, keep going. Tommy, I do not wanna be in here. Keep walking down, come on. Further, all the way down here. It's bullshit, man, there's nothing in here. There's nothing in here. Look, I know you don't want to be here. I'm just going to go through really, really fast, I promise, and then we're leaving. All right, I know you don't want to be here. It's a once in a lifetime thing, all right? Please just let me do this. Five minutes, five minutes, five minutes, tops. I promise five minutes. Tommy, I don't like this. Just come with me. Someone is going to notice a metal bar on the ground up there. Just come with me. In 10 minutes, I'm leaving. Babe, are you gonna come or what? Ash! - Nope. - Ash! I'm staying right here. Ash, are you coming? What the fuck! Hey asshole, get your fucking hands off her, man! What the, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop, stop, hey! Get the fuck away from her, man, get your fucking hands off my girl! Ash, fucking push him away! Get the fuck away from her! Hey, what the fuck are you doing, man? Hey, hey, get her the fuck out here, man! Hey, hey, hey, come on! Open this fucking door, get her out of here, man! What the fuck are you doing? Hey, come on, hey, what the fuck are you doing, man? Ash, hey, get her the fuck out here man! Hey, hey, hey! I'm coming, Ashley, I'm coming, baby, I'm coming to get you, don't worry, hold on, baby. I'm coming, I'm coming, Ash, I'm coming, I'll be there soon, alright! Ashley! Ashley, where are you? Ashley, what the fuck is that? What the fuck is that? What the fuck is this? What the fuck is this? Happy. Happy? Jesus fucking Christ, are you okay? Hey man, are you okay? Are you okay over there? Hey, oh fuck, God! Jesus fucking Christ! Why are you doing this to us? Please, don't hurt me. Fuck, no! I guess this wasn't such a good idea after all. Everything started here for me. My first kill, I was pretty close to your age. My hair was a little longer than yours though. For a long time, I always thought this place would be my tomb. Every time I tried get out, something kept calling me back. Tommy, Tommy, you still with me? And they think they're gonna tear this place down? I'd like to see them try! Because whatever soul sets foot inside this place will be trapped inside forever with us. Leave me alone! Let me out! Let me out! Ashley. Ashley. Go right up. Go right up. Be one of my children. Be one of my children. Tommy is with us. I wanna go home! Yes he is. I wanna go home! Why are you fighting me? Let me out of here! It can all be over. Let me out of here! Join us. Please, please, just let me out of here. Please, I just want to go home, please. Ashley, Ashley, it's okay. I feel a lot better now. They're really out here. They really are. Just say yes and you'll be with me. It's me, Ashley, Tommy. Are you gonna help me pack or what? No, I'm taking a shower. Get over here, come and help me pack. Soda and jalapeno chips. Babe, I really don't wanna go back inside. Please babe? You're really gonna make me go back in there? For your fucking jalapeno chips? My favorite.
