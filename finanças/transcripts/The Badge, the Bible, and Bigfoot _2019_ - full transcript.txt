Hopefully there shouldn't be too many files on your desk on Monday. - Any word on what's gonna be on the agenda coming up? - I'm not supposed to say anything, but I know they're gonna make budget cuts. - I have a few minutes, you wanna grab some coffee? - Sure. I wanted you to know so that you can be prepared. - I appreciate that. - I've already tried to talk to them. - Thank you for speaking with them. - But you know, mayor doesn't get a vote but I certainly did put my two cents in about it. - That's too bad, I won't be able to blame you if they fire me. - Thanks for the coffee, I'll see you Monday. - Enjoy your weekend. - The rain is likely to come down heavy at times, during overnight hours. And tomorrow it starts out very wet but I think we may see some sun for the afternoon this time. Radar satellite combines- - Well, something seems to be eating my grandfather's cattle. Some of them are just straight up missing. - Someone will come out later and check it out. Once I finish this case. Considering disbanding the police department. - That's a shame to hear. Maybe you should swallow humble pie. - I'm never swallowing humble pie. - Humble pie could be good for you Harrison. That's why I'm still in office. - While you're taking calls, I'm going home for the day. I hope I'm not late. - No, we still have a couple of minutes but you are the first up. - Okay, I'm ready. - Hopefully everything goes in your favor. - I hope so too. - You have my support. - Thank you. - I call this meeting to order. First item on the agenda is the police department. The council has requested an executive session. We've decided to disband the police department because the town needs to allocate funds to the fire department. There've been more fires every winter than there's need for police department. - No need for the police department, can I speak here? Who's gonna answer the calls. - The sheriff has decided to answer the calls. - The sheriff, oh, he wants to contract. Is that what this is about? So you can give the fire department a rise and a new fire engine but then you have to cut the police department. - But we just need the funds to help offset all these fires. - Well what about cutting my salary? I've made some good relationships here and I care about the town. I don't care about the money. Cut my salary, I'll take a pay cut, will that work? - Now, chief Harrison, you've done a wonderful, fine job with the people but we just need the funds to help offset all these fires. - Okay, well here, take my badge now, I'm leaving. - Harrison, I'm really sorry we have to let you go. - Yeah, I know you are, it's not your fault. - We just don't have it in the budget. - I gave it all I had, so. - Could you do one favor for me before you go? - One more favor. - Can you drop the car off? - All right, I'll drop the car off, where? - Over, out by the yard. - Okay, all right, I'll talk to you later. - I'll see you around. ♪ How can you love me ♪ ♪ How could you give your life for me ♪ ♪ Don't you know me ♪ ♪ But don't you see my insecurities ♪ ♪ I'm not worth your time. ♪ ♪ I'm too messed up for you ♪ ♪ What do you want from me ♪ ♪ I always hear you say that you love me ♪ ♪ Oh, you love me ♪ ♪ You take me as I am ♪ ♪ Every fault I have ♪ ♪ Oh you love me ♪ ♪ Oh you love me ♪ ♪ Every step of the way you show me your grace ♪ ♪ Oh you love me ♪ ♪ Oh you love me ♪ ♪ Your grace is amazing ♪ ♪ It's been sung about for years ♪ ♪ Every fear I had ♪ ♪ They've all seemed to disappear ♪ - He was grabbing some cameras and set up, hoping they recorded images of a longtime fascination, Bigfoot. As he was walking back to his truck. - Then a rock was threw, she chased him. I just kind of stopped, took the fall now, gazed the hill, kept looking. - He's still out there. - Not just one, he says three different Bigfoots stared at him from the hill. This is just a snippet of 10 minutes of video Teak says he recorded. - It was crazy. - He's a member of the Catawba Valley Bigfoot- - Sheriff, can I talk to you? - Yeah, you can talk to me, hold on. - A hunter came in this morning. He says he saw Bigfoot. - All this stuff in the news about Bigfoot, come on. - But can't you just check it out. - I don't have any extra men to go looking for a bigfoot. - What else have you got to do? - I got plenty to do in this county. - Hot spot for these sightings though the path leading to this larger than life creature often goes cold. Scientists say there's a logical reason for this. - Harrison. - I need to talk to you, where you at? - I'm down at the Rib Shack. - Can you meet me? - Okay, I'll meet you at the dock. - When? - In about a hour. - Okay, I'll see you then, thanks Harrison, bye. - Evidence Bigfoot exists, Teak disagrees. - They're real, they're there. - As does Vicki Cook. - Was there one in front of my camera. - Earlier this summer, she shared this grainy video taken outside her Cleveland county home. - Screamed, I didn't know what it was but that body was tall. - With big feet to boot both Cook and Teak took casts of the creature's feet. - There's probably a lot more evidence than people realize. - Some will scoff but others like Cook, Teak and even his granddaughter believe. - Harrison. - Mayor, what'd you want to talk to me about. - A hunter came in this morning. He saw something. - A hunter? - He swears it was Bigfoot. - I don't have time to play games. Won't you just give that to the sheriff? - He laughed at me. You're the only hope we have in this town. We all know what you were. - Good day, mayor. - I know you could look into this. - I don't work for the town anymore. - Does it matter that you're fired? I know the kind of guy you are. - Have a good day, mayor. - Okay, I'll see you around. - He reported to Cryptozoology News that the "strangest beast" terrorized him and his dog. WMTW News aids, Allie Miles headed to Litchfield to see what residents thought of this sighting. - These casts go from 1950 to 1967. - From skulls and figurines to a giant foot print, even some DNA testing Bigfoot hair- - Bigfoot. There's no such thing as a Bigfoot. - Portland Cryptozoology Museum has it all when it comes to creatures that may or may not exist. - Some people just don't wanna talk about when they've seeing something like that. - But that doesn't mean everyone wants to believe in Yetis. - Most likely it's just one of the big, hairy guys that live around here, roaming around. - The tiny town of Litchfield might not know it yet. - You guys want to go to the park after school and do your practice today? - Sure. - Sure, I would love to, I love going to the park on rainy days. - I'm still kind of sore from the class practice. - And that's what sort of creepy but that's totally fine. - I can't wait to go. - We better get going, come on. And I'll fall on top of you and crush you. - Cindy, where' your jacket? - My mom's washing it. - Oh, wow well we'll practice some more today. - You're so lucky, I heard Johnny wants to take you to the dance and Jesse's mega jealous. - Oh my gosh, that's really crazy. - I've always wanted someone to take me to the dance. - I suppose, if you don't mind sore toes and bad breath. Oh my gosh, what was that? - I'm sure it's nothing. Maybe we should move from the spot. - I think we should get out of here guys, come on. - Anywhere from here is good. Hurry up Coco. - Oh my gosh, what was that? - No, wait! - Guys, let's play hide and seek, Cindy you're first. - Okay, let's go, count to thirty. - One, two, three, four, five- - Do you know where Cindy is? She didn't find me, did she find you? - She didn't come and find me either. I don't know where she's at. - Cindy! Did you hear that? - Cindy? Cindy! - Cindy, where's Cindy? - It's getting dark, I think we should go tell your mom. - I know. - I can't find my daughter. - somebody took her. - Yeah, I'm on scene. - Are you looking into those missing girls? - I don't see anything out here. - Okay. - I'm wasting my time. - That's fine, just let me know what you find out. - Have you seen anything? - I haven't seen anything. - What, no clothing, shoes, no tracks at all? - Let me call you back, let me call you back. I think I just heard something. - Okay, call me back. - Social media is buzzing after a Hickory man says he captured something amazing on his cell phone camera, video of Bigfoot. - He recorded this video in McDowell county were several people- - Mayor, what are you doing here? Are you coming to bother me again? - Did you see the news? - Yeah, I've seen the news. What's the sheriff doing about it? - He went missing. - Missing, you're sure he didn't just take the day off. - You're all we have left. - I might check it out. - Cindy! God, please show us where she's at. Cindy! God please, please keep her safe. Cindy, Cindy. If you won't help me, I'll do it myself. Savanna, Cindy. Savanna, Cindy. Savanna, Cindy. - Lord, I know I haven't been the best man but I'm coming to you today and I'm just asking You for strength. I'm asking for guidance. Please lead me to these girls so I can save them. And please protect me while I'm out there. I'm too weak without You. And if there is a beast and he's hurt those little girls, I'm asking for Your forgiveness now but I'm gonna kill him. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. I will fear no evil You're lucky I didn't blow your face off. - Oh please, I'm here to help. - What are you doing here? - I can fight. - You can fight? - Yes. - Well, you're not needed to fight. You just stay behind me then. - I can help you. - You can't help me. - Here is no one else, Harrison. - I don't need to worry about you too. - I thought you weren't coming. - Well, I'm not here for anyone but the kids. So don't get in the way. - Harrison, you need backup. The sheriff went missing, he's gone. You have no one. - Well I'm here. - And I'm here too. - Why don't you just take yourself back to the house? I don't need to worry about you too. - You think I can't help you? - No, you can't help me. - This is my town. I'm not just gonna sit around the house. As mayor of this town, I'm gonna find these children and bring them home. I'm gonna do something about this with or without you. I'm staying. - Then you stay behind me and don't get in the way. - You're gonna need me. - Let's go, stay behind me. We're gonna find him and we're gonna kill him and we're gonna save those girls. You ready? - I'm ready. - Let's go. Take this, you're gonna need it. - What are you gonna use? - I don't need anything, stay close. - Harrison. - What? - I got to use the bathroom. - The bathroom? Hunters don't use the bathroom, hold it. That's what they do, they hold it. - I'll be back. - Okay, go to the bathroom, I'll wait. - I'm ready. - What'd you use for toilet paper? - Mind your business. - Let me see the shotgun. Where is the shotgun? - I sat it to you when I had to go to the bathroom. - Gotta be kidding me. See that's why I didn't wanna bring you. It's okay, we don't need it. We don't need it. All right, come on, keep up. I'm sorry I yelled at you about the shotgun. I wouldn't say I believe in Bigfoot yet but there was something out there. I was chasing it this morning. - Whatever this thing is, there's been too many reports around the world of something that matches the description of Bigfoot. God created this thing. And God gave us dominion over all the animals. We don't have to be afraid. We just look that thing right in the eyes and command it in Jesus' name. - And with God, we can do all things. And if he created it, then you're right. He's in control, so we should be okay. - Thank you for coming out here to check it out. I'm glad you got on board with me. As tuff as I want to be sometimes, it's nice to have a big guy like you around. So thank you. - Well, this might sound insane but I guess I'm glad you're out here too. That way I can use you as bait. - Harrison! - Let's get going before it gets too dark. - Is this a truce? - It's a truce. - How are you gonna find him? Look at all this, thousands of acres to go through. - Don't worry about finding him, he'll find us. - Is it true what they say about you? - What's true? What story are you talking about? - They say you saved a bunch of children. - God helped me save a bunch of children that day at the school, there was an active shooter. And when you show up on scene you're supposed to wait for the team before you can enter the school but there were children involved. And I didn't think we had time to wait for the team. So I was the first on scene. I rushed the school. There were two active shooters. I was taking fire. I went room the room till I got close enough. And then I ran out of ammo. So inside one of the classrooms, one of the shooters rushed me and I bluffed him. I didn't have any ammo but I got the drop on him. I made him think that I was still loaded. So I got him in custody and took his weapon. So when his buddy ran in, I use his buddy's gun against him. And I was able to take both of them in the custody and save the children. - Wow. - That's not much of a story, I guess when you're taking fire and in a dangerous situation and you put the children's lives before your own, I guess it means something. - That's amazing. I can see why everybody thinks you're a hero. Did you get hurt? - I would've got hurt but something told me to wear my vest that day and normally on patrol, I wouldn't wear my best because it made me look like I had a few extra pounds. - Harrison. - I know that's silly. - God was really with you that day. That's a beautiful story. - Enough of me and the stories, let's get going. These girls need us. And I plan on saving more children today. - You're certainly a hero to me. - What was that for? - I was very moved by your story. - Thank you. - We should keep moving. Harrison, I think I found his feet. - Let me see. It looks like we're on the right track but like I told you earlier, he'll find us. We don't have to find him. Now just keep looking for the girls. - Cindy. We're in a nest. - What kind of nest? - The monster that carried us away nest. - I don't hear him anymore. So you can relax a little bit. But from the looks of it, this looks like it's his favorite area. Look at all the trees down. Okay, now it's time to make our plan. You wanted to help, it's time to be bait. - Bait, are you serious? - We need to set this trap up. I need you to get his attention. Run this way past the big tree. I'm gonna be waiting on him. - I'm fast Harrison but I don't think I can outrun Bigfoot. - You can do it, I believe in you. - I'll do anything for those kids. - Well let's get this done then. Yelp for when you get close. - Okay. - Let's do it. Claire, one more thing. - We have to get out of here. What if he comes back? How do we get out of here? - I don't know. - I'm sure God will lead us on the right path. - Yeah, let's go before that monster comes then we get stuck - Be careful, I won't nothing happen to you. - Okay. - Cindy, are you okay? - It's bleeding pretty bad. - It's okay. - Lord, please guide us on the right path so that we can get out of this forest safely. And please send us help, please. In Jesus' name, amen. - Get ready, he's coming! - Watch out! - I can't believe I kicked and hurt him. - That's because you kick like a girl. I don't think he's chasing us anymore. I don't hear him. I think we're safe. - What are we gonna do? - We're gonna make a plan. I don't hear him. - Tell me the plan. - The plan is we're gonna find them. I got backup to help us. - A gun? - Yeah, always come prepared. - You think that little thing is gonna take down a bigfoot? - It's the man behind the gun that matters. - You're better off doing it with your bare hands. I just wanna find the girls. We don't have to kill him. - We're gonna have to kill him before he kills us. - I'm really afraid, Harrison. - The Bible tells us 365 times not to fear and we're not gonna start doing it today. Let's get going. I think I heard something over here, just stay there. - Claire, are you okay? - I'm okay. I just hurt my hand. - What happened? - I fell, stabbed my hand. - Let me see it. - Ouch. - You're okay, it's gonna be okay. - I'm not as tough as you. - It's not your job to be tough. It's my job to be tough. I'll take care of you. Just stay close. It's time to move locations but he's here with us. If somehow we could just get his attention. I know he'll see or hear us. - Do you think the girls are close by? - Let's keep moving. - What'd you do in the military? - I was airborne in [indistinct], infantry pretty much. - Did you go to war? - I did have to go to war a few times. - I'd say I'm in good hands. You don't talk about it much. - Well, ever since I read in the Bible that if you look back on the plow, you're not fit for the kingdom. I try not to look back in the past much. - That's not really looking back in the past. It's just telling war stories. - To me that's the past, so. - Is it hard for you to talk about? - No, I just prefer not to. - I get it. - And it just got me a shoe box full of certificates and medals and they sit under my bed. Oh, I got to go to the bathroom. - I thought hunters didn't use the bathroom. - I'm a cop and we use bathrooms. - Don't forget your gun. - I don't forget my gun, only beautiful women do. - Harrison, here he is. - Where is he? I see him, all right, here's our chance. Now it's time to set up the trap. - There he is! - Here he comes, get out of here. Bless be the Lord my strength, who teaches my hands the war and my fingers to fight. - Get up Harrison. Hey Bigfoot, leave him alone. Harrison! - Put her down! - Are you okay? - Yes. - Great, let's get out of here. Harrison, I found the girls. - Oh you found them. Girls, thank God. Let's get out of here. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Let's get you home, come on. - Sorry, did I wake you? - This dream I was having is what woke me. You know what I think you're right. - I'm right? About what? - I think it's time to throw away these violent movies and these monster films. There's gotta be some cleaner action movies I can be watching. And then it makes me think about that scripture from Sunday that Matthew 6:22, your eyes, the lamp to the body. You know, they're gonna let in light or darkness and that's gonna fill your body. - I'm so proud of you. - I'm gonna do that for you and the family. And for God, I'm gonna let more light into my body instead of darkness. - You know, honey, you spent so many years in the military and as a law enforcement officer. All you did was train to fight. It was kill or be killed. You've had this mentality for years and I think that you were turning to these movies as a way to cope with all this stress. It's not natural. - I guess when I was in the military and on the police force, I use these movies to take the stress away, but I guess it did more damage than it did good. - You need to turn to God. - Maybe I'll be less irritable and negative if I stop watching so many violent movies. - It's been hard but I'm glad that God is showing you what you need to do. - I want to be a better husband and father and Christian. - I was reading while you're asleep. "Be happy young man, while you're young and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth, follow the ways of your heart and whatever your eyes see. But know that for all these things, God will bring you to judgment. - For the family, I'm gonna be a better head of household. - I'm so glad. That means a lot to me, I'm really proud of you. ♪ Lord knows I not a perfect man ♪ ♪ But I think He knows that I'm doing the best that I can ♪ ♪ Is it enough ♪ ♪ Is it enough that I pray each day ♪ ♪ And love my wife and my family ♪ - Forget about it. ♪ Is that what ♪ ♪ Is it enough to while we feel His grace ♪ ♪ And see the sun shine on your face ♪ ♪ But all my sins are counted ♪ - Oh, cool what's that? - A sea monster.
