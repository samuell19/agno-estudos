SIDE STREET STORY 1940-1950 Neapolitan diary of events in the world, yesterday, today... tomorrow? This, perhaps, is not even a story... besides, if it were, it wouldn't be an original story. It's been a long time since we had new stories. Man always gets old stories. So old that they end up seeming new again. This one takes place in a big city, that everyone, more or less, has seen... but that few know in depth. A city that is not only made of streets and squares... like all the other cities in the world, but, above all, of side streets. Narrow, dark, foul smelling side streets... where nobody likes to go and stay. Like huge stone sponges soaked in... human beings afflicted by the same problems, needs and sufferings. You can take one as an example. When it comes down to it, they're all the same. At that time Don Gennaro Iovine was a tram driver. In his head there were only bills; electricity bills, gas bills, but when the time came he was fine. Donna Amalia, his wife, was cooking and complaining at the same time. But it was just a question of not listening to her. Even the noise of their daughter's washing was pleasant. Amedeo played boisterous games of escoba, in which only honor was at stake, with his colleague Federico, who was always a little distracted. The joyful shrieks of the youngest daughter, who was playing with the other little kids, spread high until they became one with those of the birds. At that time the accountant Spasiani left home with his wife and children... and walked to the main street to admire the beauty of the shop windows. Thinking that one day, surely, it would be possible to buy something. Upon returning from her part-time job as a maid, Donna Adelaide, the most distinct creature in the side street, would fix dinner... for her granddaughter Assunta and her boyfriend, who were waiting for darkness to do their thing. And also for two retirees. Peppe, cab driver, alias "Trickster" due to alleged cheating with the taxi meter. Get off! I already told you to stop annoying me. - Is the food ready? - It's ready. And Settebellize, the authorized guide. PROVINCIAL FASCIST FEDERATION It is strictly forbidden to cook, wash and keep poultry on the streets... and disturb or litter public spaces in any other way. A sense of dignity for all citizens is called upon so that... these types of activities unworthy of a civilized life cease. The Federal. The radio in the corner coffee shop was broadcasting music played... for the enjoyment of all. Excuse me, Donna Amalia, but do you have to do this right here? - Do what? - The oven, you see? My house is full of smoke. My granddaughter and friend are choking. You know we have a house without a proper kitchen. When you cook, don't I get smoke in my house? - Depends on the wind. - Now the wind is blowing that way. - Have a talk with the wind. - The wind, yes. You talk too much. Donna Amalia, your smoke is annoying. The wind has changed. A dirty trick, taking advantage of a woman! I'm calling my husband! - Call whomever you want. - He's coming. I don't swear and I don't want to swear. Excuse me, Countess. My husband is a railroad worker. Aren't you going to give your wife a hand? Me? Let her wear herself out so she'll have less energy to fight me tonight. You can buy coal, but the poor pensioners are left to starve! Me? I do what I can with the little I get! Don't give us your stories! We all make sacrifices. Too much shouting over here! - Mind your own business. - Leave me alone. Donna Amalia, you're arrogant. We all live here. Have a little consideration. My wife too. - Donna Carmela. - Just what we needed. Let's talk. If you have anything to say about the coal, say it to me, get it? Excuse me. You have an inheritance, my husband doesn't. It's good to have a good fight once in a while. You get information about other people without a sweat. It's like the movies or the newsreels. Listen, they're still at it. If I were in charge I would propose a law. A compulsory fight on the streets of Italy, three times a week. You could openly know what people think. Don Gennaro, we would all end up in jail. So, where are we now? Please! The day will come when we'll be able to shoot in the streets. - What happened? - Women... The guards are coming! Out, out. - Excuse me, one moment! - Orders are orders, sorry! Can't you read? It's forbidden to cook and hang clothes in the alley. - It's in the manifest. - Sure. This neighborhood needs some tidying up, it's indecent. The street's being used as a dining room or kitchen. So where would you like me to cook? Come see how we live in here! - Take it away. - No! - Take it away. - The chair too? The notice has been up for over a month. Perhaps now we're all rich and they raised the taxes? Do something! Can't you see they're taking all the stuff? - It's a theft. - What did you say? I said I think it's theft. Instead of taking things from houses... wouldn't it be better to make houses for the people? The neighborhood is impossible. Too many people. - Houses, huh? Come with me. - Where? Come and speak to the "Federal". Maybe he'll build you new houses. Follow me! Whose child is this? Whose is it? Where is the mother of this child? Can you tell me whose child this is? - What happened? - The whole store's on fire. - Well, call the fire department! - I already did, they're out of water. What are you waiting for? Pour water and put it out! You guys, come quick. It's done, unload the stuff. - Unload it now! - Unload what? There's nothing here Just look what they've done to me. - And what should I do? - Leave. Go away! Beat it! What are you waiting for? Pasquale, I want to know something and you have to tell me the truth. - Are you happy? - Yes, I am. I am. I am happy. I've wanted to do this since I was a kid, and thank God I succeeded. Why? Aren't you? Yes, but when I think about it I sense a contradiction. Why a contradiction? You work, you eat, you have children, you struggle. And life is beautiful; sometimes it's continuous and sometimes not. - Pasquale, you didn't understand. - No? When I talk to you I always find a lack of understanding. Because they're talking about war, get it? - It will break out. - No, why should it? Will war break out? Do you want to go to a war? Me? Go to war having a family? They talk, yes... they talk mostly abroad. War won't break out. - It's a bluff. - Bluff? They've had anti-aircraft drills, they've had blackouts. ?So? They're strong, if they say so, it's because they've thought of everything. Pasquale, today wars are brief; the blitzkriegs. Blitzkriegs cannot happen. - They advance by surprise. - Not possible. I'm betting my head on it. War won't break out. War's broken out. War's broken out. - Excuse me, has war broken out? - Yes. - But tell me, against whom? - I don't know, I'm going find out. - See? - I'm sorry. I was mistaken. - Patience. - I'm going home. - So am I. Take care. WE'RE AT WAR HUSH, THE ENEMY'S LISTENING WE WILL WIN NAPLES PREFECTURE. The civic and patriotic sense of all citizens... is called upon in order to prevent the illicit sale of rationed products. This crime will be considered an attack on the fatherland. Whoever profits... shall be punished in accordance to the current laws. The Prefect. This one's for the cavaliere. This one's for don Antonio. And this one for donna Amalia. - Where is Mama? - She's talking to Donna Vincenza. - Where's Papa? - He hasn't woken up yet. I'm awake, I'm awake. Awake since five o'clock. When was it possible to snooze a while in this house with your mother? Where are my macaroni? - Where are my macaroni? - How should I know! Dad, did you eat them? The macaroni? They weren't for me? We can't go on like this! I told everyone that my food is not to be touched! You ate yours last night. You didn't get enough? Yes, I ate them... I don't remember. Mine or yours... every man for himself. I don't understand. You eat at night. You wake up on purpose. I don't remember. But you remembered where I hid them. I don't mess with other people's stuff. If this goes on, it will end badly. You do it on purpose. I work, how do I make it to lunch now? Calm down, calm down. The truth is that I don't remember. I think you're exaggerating. Exaggerating? Exaggerating, Dad? And this is my bread. That too? Put a label on it. - Amedeo. - Yes? - Something wrong? - Don't even talk to me... - They won't even leave me some bread. - It's your fault too. - Mine? - Yes. If you wanted to make money there would be a way. - You're kidding. - Why? How much does a kilo of lead cost? Should I steal the pipes instead of fixing them? "Steal"... A little here a little there. There are buyers who would pay for it like gold. - Peppi...! - I didn't say anything. Just shooting the breeze... - It's dangerous to sell it. - I have a very safe system. - Did you get everything? - Tonight at 3:30. - 200 pounds. - How much do I owe you for my share? - Don't worry about it. - Will you give it to me as a gift? They're not gifts I can give, unfortunately. But I don't want money from your hands. Once sold, you cover my costs and the rest is yours. No, you get half. To please you is worth more than half to me. You confuse me Don Arrigo, I would like to please you too. I want to put my half in another business. - With the accountant? - You can advise me. If I don't get back the pawned pendant, will you take care of it? Don't worry, I'll take care of it. - Twelve thousand. - I'm lucky to be working with you. - I'll see you around. - I'll see you later. - Morning, Donna Amalia. - Good morning. I'm sorry, but I don't have time at the moment. No problem! Even if you don't have time... we can always find a way to fix it. The war means no tramway, but Pasquale Miele cannot stop. He has a wife, children and a mother-in-law to take care of. He's invented the dead man's job. His distinguished clients know where to find him... and hire him, when they're in danger. Very good, don Pasqualino, you've brought the bag. What bag? It's a loaf of bread. Donna Carmela from Forcella gave it to me. She kind of likes me. Listen up. This... is real coffee. Clean the filter well and bring it back later. Will do. Pasqualino! - Here we go. - What's going on? Your presence is required. - Where? - At my house, it's urgent. Amedeo, let's understand each other. I told your mother that when she needed me, I'd be at her complete disposal. But misfortune has struck me! First we have to agree on a price. If not, I'm staying put.. All right, then. How much do you want? Two thousand lire and a kiss on top. It seems too much. Extortion that I didn't expect from you. Extortion or not, life's expensive. And I'm the one sticking my head out. Okay, I can't say no right now. Two thousand lire. - And the kiss? - What kiss? The kiss on top means you have to put the money up front. My mother will give it to you, trust me. But up front. You know what the problem is? I've told you, it's happened to me before. Favors are soon forgotten. Once on shore, we pray no more. There's no danger, come. - Giovanni, keep my lunch for me. - It's in good hands. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hurry up, you have to get dressed. The clothes are there, I'll take care of it. Ah, finally! Come on, quick! Don Pasquale, there's no time to lose. Get ready. He wants to get paid first. - How much? - Two thousand lire. Now we see eye to eye. Pasqualino to the stage. Strength and courage. - Open up! - Who is it? - Good day. - Good day to you. What happened? A great man in excellent health. It must be an epidemic. We've found other similar dead men in other houses. We transport them ourselves, but not to the cemetery... but to jail. Enough! I don't want to hurt anyone, but I don't want to be taken for a fool. - You better not come in. - Why not? I can hear crying. - What's happened? - Who is it? - The dead man's brother. - Ah, the brother is here! Come in, there's room for you too. No bullshit. Else I'll have you in chains. No, no sergeant, my husband died at 2:35. Congratulations on the five minutes. Let's finish with this stage show. What kind of town is this? It's become indecent and I'll sort it out. - You, get out of bed and come with me. - No, you must believe us! My husband is really dead. There are people who want to destroy us. Are you heartless? Can't you see the whole family's in despair? What runs in your veins? All right, touch the dead man if you have the courage. Commit that sacrilege if you're not afraid of excommunication! All right, you say he's dead and I believe you. I even want to watch over him. Next to the nuns. I'll keep them company. When the dead man goes, I go. SHELTER # 56 Tell my husband I'm at the Via Cetta Shelter, number 56. Sergeant... we have a good shelter nearby. Lest out of spite... If it scares you, you can go. I feel bad about leaving a dead man alone. I'll take care of the dead man. Mr. Dead Man, would you be so kind as to rise so we can all go to the shelter? Because it's dangerous here. We really are going to die. They're getting closer. They're "flying fortresses". Anti-aircraft fire, those are machine guns. It's beginning to rain. The rain is starting! These are flimsy houses, if a bomb falls there'd be nothing left of us. For you, Mr. Dead, your trials and tribulations are over. Think, instead, how much your brother will have to suffer. Since you're really dead, bombs don't impress you. Fair enough. Let's see what's down here. You never know, dead bodies are often greedy too. Here it is. Here it is, here it is, I knew it. All the good stuff. Very good, really. You're not dead, I'm sure. The contraband is under the bed. But I won't arrest you. It's sacrilege to touch a dead man. But it's even more sacrilege to touch a wise guy like you. Do me a favor and move. If you move, I won't arrest you, upon my word. I won't even search the house, I promise! So if you arrest me you're a scoundrel. You gave your word of honor. A promise is a promise, I won't arrest you. - But remember, I'm no fool. - Neither am I, sergeant. Come on, bye-bye. One moment, you, come here. - He's my husband. - Come over here. - It's daddy. - You're the brother, follow me. I promised not to arrest the dead man, but I will arrest his brother. I'm not his brother. Good, now you'll have to answer for lying to a public official! They bombed shelter 56! There were so many people! Dona Carmela was there. Carmela. Carmela! - Come on, let's go. - Sergeant, what should I do? - Just go, go. - Thank you, sergeant. SHELTER #56 - Excuse me, excuse me. - Where are you going? My wife is there. - Can't do a thing till support arrives. ORDINANCE The Commander of the German Armed Forces... in the South, Marshal Kesselring orders the... evacuation of the coastal area. The limit of the... area is defined by a line starting from... Villamare, passing through Via Manzoni up to Via Belvedere. Therefore it is requested that in each building tenants... with a sense of understanding and solidarity... offer hospitality to the displaced people. The evicted kept in their hearts... the faint hope of finding their miserable belongings intact. Some worshipper in the alley remembered to refill the lamp to the Virgin. But the breath of war is not sufficiently religious. The insurgent cobbler is gone. - Excuse me, any Germans around here? - They're crawling all over the place. And partisans have killed a German, look over there. Holy Virgin! - And Americans over there.. - Where did you find them? In Torre del Greco, 12 km for 12 kg of apples. Tomorrow I'll go too. - Good-bye. - Go and protect yourself. My alley's down there. I'm going to see what my family is up to. If they've escaped or not, if they're alive or if they're dead... Go that way, it's full of Germans here. It's a little longer but it's better. - Are you sure? - If I say so, it's because it's true. Go that way, down the stairs, and to the left, you'll be fine. - Down the stairs and turn left? - Always to the left. - Much obliged. - Good luck to you. Buy cheap! Buy war trophies! See the weapons that the Fascists used against us. Take them home. Sabers, daggers... - Don Pasqualino. - What is it? - It's done. - Where? - At the checkpoint. Settebellizze was arrested and gave your name and address. Very kind of him, thank you. What crime? A few cartons of American cigarettes. The bulk of it has been taken to your house. - So when they search... - I understand. - What about compensation? - You tell us, Don Pasquale. What can I say? What will the sentence be like? It should be about a month or a month and a half in jail, at the most. - 45 days. - Yes. Considering I have a wife, daughters and mother-in-law in my care... So, three kids who need to eat. Mother in law and wife who have their expenses. It's 50 thousand lire or count me out. You know that Settebellizze won't pay expenses. Who's talking about Settebellizze? Settebellizze will crown my head. Let's go. - See you in two months. - Let's go. - So like we said? - Think of my family. They'll get the 50000 tonight. TRESPASSERS WILL BE SHOT it seems these people... take you to court... And if the sentence is longer than 45 days? We'll work out the difference and add to the amount. I hope so. I'm innocent! I know nothing! - Confess, let's not waste time. - One moment, please. - You sells cigarettes and whisky to he? - Yes, sir. - Where you get cigarettes and whisky? - In Naples. You don't know a thing. On any corner, you'll find... people selling cigarettes. "Yes all right", two black soldiers sold them to me. "Yes all right", the gentleman has nothing to do with it. - You what name? - Me? Pasquale Miele. - Where living? - Me? Via Scacia Conti 17, fifth floor. I'm going to order a search at your place. No need, I'll tell you what's in my house. I have a case of whisky and 70 packs of Camel. In Naples there is an infinite number of sellers like this one. I just made the mistake of buying a few cigarettes. Tell me what my fine is because I've already wasted a lot of time. I'll just seize the merchandise. - Good night. - Thank you, good night. - And how much do you think I'll get? - Get? Yes, what will become of me? No, you said truth, not like others: "me no fascist", "me no black shirt". You nice. I no book you, I let you free. No, not possible. Excuse me, I have committed a crime. I have to be in the slammer at least 45 days. Not important, you not rich, you earn to live. I know Italians. Very pleasure Naples, all songs, all music. - Bravo, you show a good heart. - I dream to stay in Italy. Yes, I want study singing. - Me have a good voice. - I can tell! What a nice delicate perfume! I like it when people take care of themselves. - Settebellizze gave it to you, right? - Why? I bought it myself. What does Settebellizze have to do with it? No, I was just saying that, naively. Listen, Donna Amalia. I have to ask your advice, for certain things, you understand much more than the law people. My husband worked for the streetcar company and he'd take good care of me. So I have a certain level. - This fur is beautiful! - Yes, it's pretty. Before the war I got by with half a day. But now I earn a salary and... Donna Amalia, I've bought a hat. - What do you think, should I wear it? - Does it look bad on you? No, it fits perfectly. What a nice bag! I even measured it by myself, when my nephew wasn't around. You know what it's like to go out onto the street with all those rude boys. - With all those mean people. - Let them all get stuffed! - You deserve the hat. - Yes, I do. After so many years, I deserve the hat, don't I? Excuse me. - Come in. - Excuse me. - Come in. - Good evening. Good evening. - Finally, I've been ready for a while. Sorry, I had some urgent things that delayed me. You're looking good, you look like a youngster. Goodbye, Donna Amalia. The shirt button's on the table. If you need anything, just call. - Have fun. - Thank you, good night. I've sent two trucks to Rome. If I'm not there when they load, things disappear. Then I passed by the jewelry store, look. These are worth 3 and a half million. They're very nice. Flawless and very white. So, these are mine? Everything's been split fairly and equitably. Since you find so much difficulty in joining yours with mine... What can I do? I'll accept things as they are and say no more. Don Enrico, you've shown your intentions in a thousand ways. Your looks, your care and attention. These are things that a woman doesn't miss. I have feelings of sympathy for you, too. An energetic, determined man, the man I would have married. But now I have three children, and Gennaro. It's been more than a year since we heard from Don Gennaro. You know I'm a fool for you, I'm ready to get married. - What are you saying? I am married. - A widow, maybe. If you wanted to, you could declare presumed death. Then we wait, we see... Donna Amalia, excuse me, but couldn't it be removed? Don Enrico... I mean move it, because it gives me the creeps a bit. - Excuse me, good evening. - Good evening. Donna Amalia, excuse me, tomorrow is the meeting with the notary. I'd like you to think carefully about what you're going to do. The agreement expired 20 days ago, what's there to think about? Will you really foreclose for just 40 thousand lire? Just? - To become owner of the property... you still have to put up 50 grand more. You know it. - So keep it, and buy another house. - Another house? Nowadays rents are not affordable for us. We don't know where to go. But what is it you want? Not this, not that... Let's go, Donna Amalia. Excuse me, we have here 10,700 lire from some suits he sold. The company has to pay me. We can give you this money up front for the 40,000, what do you say? Not up to me. If Donna Amalia wants... Donna Amalia, do it for my children who won't eat tomorrow. Wait, think about my situation. - Wait! - Excuse me. This is just empty talk. You were only too glad to ask for the money. When you had the shop and strutted around the shop windows... we used to go hungry without pestering anyone. Find the 50,000 lire! If you want to keep the house... remember when you had food and we didn't. Shut your mouth! And if not, out with you! - Want to buy cigarettes? - No. No. Remember me? - No. - You don't? When the Germans were around, I passed by with a basket of apples. You told me "don't turn right, turn left, always to the left". "Go down the stairs and always to the left". I just came back. - You just got back? - Yeah, I had a bit of a long ride. Russia, Germany, Poland... I've been around the world. Ah, yes... I remember! The Germans, the apples... Just talk for the sake of talk, to give you directions. I wanted to do you a favor. If I were in charge, I'd forbid giving advice to people who don't ask for it. - Goodbye. - Bye-bye. END OF THE FIRST PART SECOND PART Coming home at 9:00 a.m.? It seems your outings are a little long, as if you were married already. I'm not married and I'm not getting married. - Husband's gone and not coming back. - So what? You'll find another one. You mind your own business. - You're already used to the idea, huh? - My heart is. And you could have kept a better eye on me. Now, even if I scream, it's no use. Nothing to be done now. Nothing to be done? Nothing? Speak, what have you done? - And when? Where? - Here. I'd sneak him in here when you were out walking and dining with Don Enrico. In here? With Rituccia in the other room? Holy Virgin! In my house, you bitch! I'll beat the shit out of you! Go call Don Enrico to give you a hand. You've already given him the right. You're a bad woman! Bad woman! Just like you. I'll kill you! Shameless! Don Gennaro has arrived. Fix your hair, Dad's coming. Daddy's back. - He's here! - I've arrived! Donna Amalia, Don Gennaro, your husband, has arrived. Donna Amalia, your husband's back! Excuse me, madam. This is your house. That's your wife. - Gennaro. - Amalia, excuse me but... Amalia... - A century, it feels like a century. - Yes, right. Sit down now. Rest. And tell me, where have you been all this time? I'll say this: A whole year wouldn't be enough for me to... tell you everything that's happened to me. Let's talk about you. Amedeo, Maria, Rituccia. - Rituccia is at school. - My daughter. - Is Papa back? - There he is, come in. - Excuse me, excuse me. - Dad! Mar?, your Papa's here. Now I see. Have you renovated? New furniture... - What about my room? - The room... - Did you change it too? - You weren't here... It's natural, after all that's happened. Don't you want to rest for a while? Yes, I haven't slept for three nights. - Then let's go. - Yes. - Where have you been? - I'll tell you later. Come on, Dad. - Come, lie down. - You had flowers for me. You don't know what I feel right now. - Would you like something to eat? - Two eggs. I'll make Amedeo's bed for you. When I was captured, a German sergeant asked what my occupation was. I told him I was a laborer, I worked with the stones. What a job, under the bombs, without food... I ran away. And so villages and villages. By train or on foot. Or by wagon, villages destroyed. Abandoned children, shootings... And so many dead, my God, so many I've seen. The dead are all the same. It's not a war, it's something else. It's something we cannot understand. Yes, fine, but rest now. How many times have I avoided death, when face to face... If I had died I wouldn't have seen all this new furniture, the renovated house. We have settled in well, Amedeo works and earns well. I do a little trading. - What does this trade consist of? - In partnership with Settebellizze. Yes, we have a partnership, he comes and goes with the truck. - And what do you do? - I manage with the car. When I find a suitable vehicle, I buy it. Buying and selling. Maria Rosaria has surprised us: she's marrying an American soldier. - She's going to America. - No! Really? But come on... You should marry a man from your own country, right? You're leaving me? You're leaving us all. Dad won't let you go. A miracle, a miracle. I tell you, I've been halfway around the world... My home, my family. My bed, my children. I've walked so much, God knows. What do you want to know? Towns and towns and towns. I met up with a man, and we slept in an abandoned barn. In the morning I would go to work where I could. In the evening I'd go back to the barn. And the other guy never came out. - You had a hard time. - You don't know the half of it, Amedeo. That bastard would talk in his sleep at night... "Help, let me go, they're killing me, they're capturing me." He was Jewish, he confessed it to me after a month together. At one point he tells me "You're going to report me". "I won't report you." - "You're going to sell me out." But I'm a gentleman. Then we escaped from there, because of the heavy bombing. The Germans... We crossed the lines. There were soldiers... They're here, they're here! Welcome back! - Good work, right? - Underwear for the allies. - Come in, sit down. - Thank you kindly. Ivana, come and count them. Come here, come here for a second. Imagine that when I was arrested, a German soldier... - Real coffee. - Coffee. Well, as I was saying. At first, when I was captured, a German sergeant... wanted to know what my occupation was. I was scared to death. - I'll have some. - Wait a minute. So I told him: "I work, I'm a laborer... I lift stones". - Would you like some coffee? - Thank you, I just had some. I can't tell you the tragedies and atrocities that my eyes have seen, Forget it, Don Gennaro, now you're home. - It's all over now. - You're wrong. You haven't seen what I've seen in the countries where I've been. - The war isn't over. - But we're at peace. Underpants. Cheers, John! We're at peace, at peace. So many times I've avoided death. I've been so close. Imagine, hiding in a field as grenades and shells were raining down. Listen to this... A German soldier places a machine gun here and says "freeze" to me. - Don Gennaro, what size are you? - Which size? - Underpants. - I don't know, my wife handles that. Let's see, don Gennaro. Please. Put your hand here. An approximation. They're not bespoke shorts. They're all cut the same. We cut like we've always cut them. If they like them, they take them, and if not, they don't. - Donna Vincenza, good morning. - Hey, Don Gennaro! I heard you're back. I'm so glad! - Dry cleaner's, eh? - We manage. - What can you do? Don Antonio! - Don Gennaro, how are you? The kid has grown. I'm so glad. What a handsome boy. A miracle. It's a miracle I'm here. Imagine that once, seven people, two mangled corpses... Don Gennaro, we've had problems too. - All of us! - Here too! It's been a terrible war. Imagine that at a certain point... Don Gennaro, please. My niece is washing herself. - Excuse me. - Ask first, right? I'm sure Don Gennaro hadn't noticed. Come on, it's getting late. - They work for the Americans. - Ah, how nice. The suffering, Don Antonio, the suffering. Imagine that one day, a truck... Don't think about it, have an English cigarette. - Do you prefer Americans? - American. Thank you. How much are cigarettes over there? Where I've been? I don't know, I didn't have a cent. God knows how I lived. Give me a light. - Have something to eat. - No thanks, I'm not hungry. And Rituccia, how is she? She has some fever, but it's nothing. Her mother says that's how they grow... Good, then you'll be eating today. Sure, it's Settebellizze's birthday and he's alone. Since he's my wife's partner, we eat at my place. But when I think of the suffering, the danger of death... You mustn't think of anything except eating and drinking. You're thin enough now. Eat something! In the towns where I've been, you could hear the cannons close by... the shelling, the guns. They made me so nervous that... when I hear a door close... Thank you... my blood runs cold. You're children, there's things you can't understand. Don Gennaro, the dessert for lunch at your house was ordered here. Sfogliatelle and cannoli, quality products. - You do it very well. - Modestly. Then... hiding inside a pit, with grenades and shots in the background... when suddenly... How much is it? - It's paid. - By whom? It was me, don Gennaro, in honor of your return. - Well, let's go. - Good bye. Coffee's coming. Hot sfogliatelle! You must forgive me for being late. I had things to do. With my best wishes. Thank you, the party's not for me but for don Gennaro who's returned. Hello, don Gennaro. Hello Ern?, I'm back. - I'm back by a miracle. - Don't think about that. Don't think... In the villages where I've been, cannons can still be heard... You can't hear them here. Friends have come to have fun, don't talk about war. Let's not talk about war. - The war isn't over. Because we've suffered. Hunger was nothing, thirst was nothing... moral suffering was the worst. Imagine that once in the middle of a... Let me speak. hidden inside a well, because all around grenades and shots were flying. We were three days and three nights without food and water. Seven people and two mangled corpses. Then, a truck... Oh! Sorry, Don Gennaro, unless I forget. Don Enrico, there's a truck for sale. - Is it in good condition? - Very good. The vehicle is registered. Are you interested? - We'll talk tomorrow. - And the commission for me... As usual. What a great suit, I've admired it since you came in. - Thank you. - It's very nicely cut. As I was saying, hidden in a well because grenades were flying... Cannon shots, I know, please let us talk. Excuse me. I was saying... We want to have some peace. It's all over now. - What do you mean, it's over? - All right, we've all had a hard time. I'm going to keep my girl company, she has a fever. In case she needs anything, it's better to be close by. - I'll go. - No, I will. You stay with our friends. Don Gennaro, it's understandable that you're still shocked... but don't worry, it's all over. You're wrong, the war isn't over, it's not over at all. Steamed coffee! A modest tribute from me and my friend Federico. Thank you, very kind. What's wrong? Mar?! Papa! Mar?, what's wrong? - Turn down the music a little. - Don't you like it? - Donna Amalia's daughter is unwell. - Rituccia? The doctor says if she doesn't get her medicine, she won't make it to tomorrow. Oh, my God! Turn it down! - Doctor, nothing? - Nothing. - What if we can't get it? - If you had called the doctor sooner... But it's the habit around here. Always waiting till the last moment. Nothing, I went around Naples, spread the word in every alley. Nothing. If it shows up, they'll bring it here. Doctor, I found this bottle, but no indications. - See if you can manage with this. - Manage? If it's the right one... This is for scabies. I wanted to warn you, Amedeo is getting into big trouble... I thank you, sergeant. I'll see what I can do. It's my daughter, my wife. My wife who hasn't been a good mother. I understand that tonight Peppe "Cricco" and your son are planning a heist. If I catch them red-handed, I'll have to arrest them. If you catch them red-handed, arrest them. What about this one? - It's for laboring women. You've brought me useless stuff. If it isn't what I asked for, don't bring it. Doctor, don't get angry. You can't find everything like before the war. Goodwill is also needed from the doctors. - So, with your skill, you can get by... - "Get by"... you jerk. - Nothing, nothing. - Nothing? I was in Forcella, Pallonetto, Cavone... they'll let us know if it shows up. - I'm going out for another look. - Yes. Maybe Mom will find it and bring it herself. - I'm going to Torretta for a moment. - If you must. It's urgent, but I'll be right back. - Do you have a handkerchief? - Yes, dad. - And take your coat. - Why, dad? It gets cooler at night and it might get late, right? No, It won't get late. But if you insist... See you later, Dad. I'll be right back. Good night, don Gennaro, and good luck to the little girl. Good night, sergeant, and thank you. - Francesco, is he back? - Not until tomorrow morning. Besides, there's no medicine. It's hard to get, even on the black market. I beg you, do something. - The girl is in a very bad way. - Yes, we know. We do everything we can, rest assured. Poor child! Donna Amalia, I've sent the boy, I can't move. Let's hope he finds it. Donna Amalia, how's the girl? Donna Amalia, nothing yet, but I'm hopeful. It's been promised for later. Maria Rosaria has left. Yes, I know. I'm told she's working with a dressmaker. Come in, who is it? Come in. Donna Amalia. Eat with us. I've gone through Naples, side street by side street. The doctor says that with the medicine, she has a good chance of making it. That's good. But unfortunately it's very difficult. We can't find the medicine. Donna Vincenza, we're talking about a little girl. Do you think that I wouldn't give it to you if I had it? Don't you agree? We've been everywhere, haven't we? Nothing, dear Donna Amalia, it's very difficult. It's a problem. It's very difficult to find. - What's wrong with Donna Amalia? - Her little girl is about to die. She's been prescribed a medicine that can't be found. They should try the black market. Can't be found. And whoever has it, hides it so the price goes up. They have no feelings. - Holy Mother of God! - It's getting late. Doctor, there's a man who lives next door, he says he may have the medicine. - Do you want to see if it's the one? - Let's see. Let's be patient. - Is this it, doctor? - Yes, precisely. I have it by chance. Six months ago my daughter contracted this disease. - Can I have it? - No, I want to talk to Donna Amalia. Amalia, come talk to the accountant. How much do you want? Nothing. I just wanted to give it to you myself. Good luck to the girl. Good night. Good night. Don Gennaro, light a candle to the Madonna, it was a real miracle. Give it to me. Boil some water. Hands up! Move forward. Keep calm. Now the night and the crisis have to pass. Tomorrow I'll come early and I'm sure I'll get some good news. We hope so. Anyway, better not stay in this room. Too many people. Stay outside, it's the same thing. Good night. - Good night, Don Gennaro. - Good night. Did you see how happy the doctor was? Calm down. We're leaving, if you need us, just call us. Good night. I told Donna Amalia, no strings attached, call us if you need anything. - We're next door. - Thank you. Why are you looking at me? I've done what everyone else has done. So why don't you speak? Since this morning you're looking at me silently. Do you want me to leave? Am I no longer worthy to be your wife? Well, I'll leave like Maria Rosaria. But speak to me. Look, Amalia. The bills don't surprise you because you've seen them arrive one by one. And you haven't had the time to see what I feel when I see them all together now. If I had been here I might have lost my mind too. You say I have to talk, but what can I say, what can I do? We can't do anything, Amalia, we have to wait. As the doctor said, we have to wait till the morning. What's happened? What's happened? The war, Amalia. I don't know. What's happened? We have to wait, Amalia. Wait till the morning. This story doesn't have an ending. What ending could it have? The night passed, and with it 10 years. So many things have happened in 10 years. And this is all. Some died, others were born... others suffered. There's another cobbler. But don Gennaro's head is still full of electricity and gas bills. Donna Amalia is back to cooking and grumbling with Rituccia. Who is beginning to be of a worrying age. Settebellizze has not been seen again. They say he secretly went to America. Maria Rosaria is back. Now she takes care of other clothes, those of her husband, Federico... who has set up a mechanic's shop, where the inn, which closed down, used to be. Amedeo isn't here, he's still in jail, but he'll be out in a few days. The children have changed. Some of them are newly-born. Good morning, accountant. The Spasiani family... in spite of everything, has grown. And at a certain hour they go for a walk along the main street... to admire the shop windows. Donna Adelaide... is back working half a day. There are new pensioners... but their treatment is the same. Assunta's boyfriend has changed. Insignificant details, come to think of it... In general, nothing has changed. There is an improvement, there are now two ordinances, not one. So you can choose. The loudspeaker broadcasts new songs... but they're still songs. WORK FOR THE UNEMPLOYED DARK GOVERNMENT BLACK MARKET CHILDREN ARE MALNOURISHED Let me do the talking. Don Pasqualino is my business. Don Pasqualino, your presence is required. Where? - It's a delicate matter. Come in, please. There was a rally organized for tonight... but the opposition wants to prevent it at all costs... Also, they've said that as soon as the speaker talks, they'll bash his head in. And we call this democracy? They didn't say it was democracy. They said "call it what you want, we'll bash his head in anyway". - They're afraid of what we'll say. - Afraid of what? Afraid of what? We're not afraid of anyone! The party is not afraid! - Are you from our party? - No, I'm not from any party. Who cares? Pasquale you have to do us a favor, you have to talk. - Me? - Yes. Our speaker heard about the threats and he refuses to speak. You understand, a good person, burdened with responsibilities. - What will the party image be like? - But I have never spoken in public. They won't let you speak, you'll just say "friends, brothers" and that's it. - There'll be shouts and boos. - Just a moment. It's not so simple. I have a wife, kids, and a mother-in-law to take care of. Plus I've heard that they have iron clubs wrapped in newspapers... It's all hype. - It's all hype. What if it's not hype? I have four children, you know. But we will pay you well. Besides, what can they do? We'll be there. They won't touch a hair on your head, we'll all be there. Listen, I'm not bloodthirsty. Ask me anything, but I can't do this. He's right. We need a large figure here. He's taking a risk. 30 thousand, is that good? - It's not a question... - 40. Hey, don't fail me, first of all because I introduced you... and then because the dignity of the party is at stake. It would look like we're scared of those bastards. Excuse me, but why doesn't one of you speak? We have positions of responsibility. Let's make it 50,000 and no more talk. - Fifty thousand? - Yes. - Hospital separately? - What are you thinking? - What if my suit is torn? - We'll buy you a new one. Let's go, people are waiting. So I just have to say "friends, brothers"? "Friends, brothers." Brothers, friends! This is a democracy and you have to let me speak! Quiet, quiet. Let him speak. We're in a democracy, aren't we? He can say whatever nonsense he wants. - Speak up, we're listening. - Speak up. Speak, or else you'll end up in the hospital. Speak, what impression are we making? Speak or I'll smash your head in. I'll speak, but what will I say? I don't know how to talk. I was just supposed to say "friends, brothers". That was the agreement. If I tell you about my life I'll make you cry. I have four children to feed. I have become a rent-a-horse. God only knows how I live. This suit is not mine. This hat was given to me as a gift. I have children, wife and mother-in-law in my care. They wanted a poor bastard to get his head bashed in. You threatened our speaker! You scoundrels! It is unworthy to engage in such primitive expressions. And above all, it is a violation of national dignity. - Inspector. - Silence! When things have to be said, we speak, and we don't use our hands. Until I have the names of the provocateurs, none of you will leave. I have to go back home. Tomorrow morning I have to pick up my son, who I haven't seen for three years. Better still. Close the door. He'll realize what kind of a father he has. Good example. - Amedeo. - Papa. Don Gennaro. - Papa. - My child. - Good morning. - Dad, what did you do? Let's not talk about it. How are you doing? - I'm fine... - You're fine, huh? They throw you in jail and you say "let's not talk"? Do you think it was for fun? Come on, I'm late for work. I want to change. You're so thin... Let's go, let's go. He got involved in politics! That way he'll learn... who he really is. We'll make him head of state. - You shut up! - Politics, dad? You get involved in politics? Who's involved in politics? Who's talking this nonsense? I was told that you applauded that poor bastard Pasqualino... who spoke in favor of the reactionaries. - Me, when? - Isn't it true? - Dad, did you applaud the clergy? - Who did? I clapped because I could. That poor guy was doing it right. No, don't fail me. - Don't mess with the reactionaries. - Me? Amedeo, change your speech, this is going to end badly. No, this is a serious speech. In prison I learned many things. I had a hard time, Now I fight for social justice. - What's he saying? - He's right. - He's right about what? - I am right. Prisons are full of people who are victims of social injustice... and bourgeois conformism. This is the century of the workers' reorganization... and my father joins the reactionaries. Go home or I'll tear your head off. These are the methods of reactionaries. I'm not going home. Make me. Is this how you're going to treat your son after three years? - Amalia, shut up. - Everyone has to shut up with you! - Is Mussolini back? - Shut up and mind your own business. - Go back home. - No. - What are you going to do? - Stay out of it. Pasquale, tell me the truth, as if you were confessing. - Are you happy? - I am now. The war had ruined me. And who wasn't ruined by the war? But for some time now, I've been happy. I'm back to working on streetcars.. And if everything goes according to plan... I'll join the state railroad staff. - In conclusion, you're happy. - Very happy. That's the problem... ...that's what really is bad. - Why is that? We don't realize it, but we should be doing badly. - We're a mess, we can't live like this. - Really? Look, Pasquale... when you drive the streetcar all the day or clean the tracks like you... there are things you can't think about. Then there are other educated, good... intelligent people who think for us. They do nothing all day but think about us. For example, they say, Pasqualino cleans tracks, how much does he earn? He earns so much. It can't be, he has children, he must earn more. But have these good people always been around? And always will be. But if they were good, they wouldn't have left us in a war. That's the thing. They couldn't help it. Because what happens here happens everywhere. The good guys are in every country. So what happens? That when the good guy here does not agree with the good guy elsewhere... war breaks out. You remember the day we were here and from one moment to the next... - Of course. - A disaster, a catastrophe. A disaster, of course. And aren't they talking about war again? New weapons, atomic bombs. - It will break out. - Don Gennaro... I don't think so, war won't break out. - Or my convic... - I believe that... Noted and passed. The day must now pass. For the Iovine family, for the side street, for all the side streets. For the whole city. A city that in the end is no different from all the other cities in the world. Full of very busy people waiting for things that are yet to happen. subtitles: scalisto for the KG tracker
