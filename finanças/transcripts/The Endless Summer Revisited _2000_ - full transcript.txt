[music playing] MALE SPEAKER: OK, we're setting up we're about to see, and that's the prologue. So what are we about to see? DANA BROWN: Well, this is a movie that's taken from the outtakes of "Endless Summer" footage never before seen and some of my dad's old surf films and with interviews of people that were involved in "The Endless Summer" and "Endless Summer 2." It's basically a reason to try to rip off the public one more time-- that'd be you people. -Just all across America, everybody in all the landlocked states saw this movie. And it was as popular in those places as it was around the beaches, because it was so new-- so different from anything they'd ever thought of. -For the first time, people in surfing felt that they had a film which told the whole story of surfing. -Bruce's was the real deal. Some of the Hollywood movies, the theme basically was the chick in the bikini wringing her hands as the guy's risking his life at Waiamea Bay-- which was all basically bullshit. And Bruce's deal was about four or five guys that travel around the world chasing the sun. It'll continue to be the greatest theme probably of any surf movie ever made. -It was the most remarkable film I had ever seen in my life, because it was adventure. Here, people were living a lifestyle that was beyond the beyond. -I mean, you look at the contributions that people have made to the sport of surfing, and if you went down the line, Duke Kahanamoku, the father of modern-day surfing, but Bruce Brown basically brought the sport of surfing to more people than any other individual. GREG MACGILLIVRAY: I was just so in love with what Bruce had done with "The Endless Summer" that it affected all my thinking. You know, the Beatles, for example, affected all of the music industry kind of subconsciously in some ways. Well, Bruce Brown was our Beatle. He kind of affected all of us in a way that was subconscious and very profound. -When Bruce started, surfing was so much different. I mean, literally in the last 30 years, surfing has come so far. He's seen it from basically just this little seed, and now it's a full tree. So he has experiences and he knows people that literally you can only read about and are really the history of our sport. BRUCE BROWN: Well, we used to surf at the Huntington Pier. Before wetsuits, the local people would bring their old tires down and leave them under the pier. So we'd pile the tires up and light them on fire and have this huge bonfire going, where you'd get out of the water and stand about 50 feet away from the thing and about fry yourself. But you could tell when the surf was up at Huntington from Seal Beach because you could see this plume of black smoke rising by the pier. Wow, the surf must be good. -This was a guy that came from a time when you could count the number of surfer. You know, there was maybe 500 surfers in the world when he started surfing. -And if you're driving down the coast and you saw a car with a board, you were virtually guaranteed to know who it was. And if you didn't, you might stop, you know, and make sure board wasn't stolen or something. -And so his relationship to this sport was very individualistic. All the guys that surfed at that time were real distinct from each other, I think. They're all pretty eccentric. -I get accused of being a player, and Bruce was the original player of having toys. And he gets two motorcycles, so he's got one for his friends to chase him around with. And we do that. Pretty soon, we've all got motorcycles. No, he's been a big influence, I think, on my life. And I would've been a little influence on his. -Creative-- very creative. In order to be a surfer, you've got to live it, breathe it. And he did it. He surfed it. He filmed it. And he was one of us, you know? To a kook, they don't even know what we're talking about. -Generally people, when they think of Bruce Brown, they think of this genius with a 16 millimeter camera that did all this fabulous stuff. But I remember a different Bruce Brown. At that time, this was prior to the time he was making films. And I can tell you this, he was absolutely the worst camera hog that I've ever seen in my life. -I probably was. I remember, I conned Gordy out of a surfboard. I went, Gordy, I'm going to Hawaii. If you give me a free board, I'll paddle out at sunset and go over the falls backwards and unroll a sign that said Gordy's surfboards forever or something. So Gordy goes, oh that's cool. So I got this free board. And I probably went over the falls lots of times, but not with a banner. -He'd do anything to be on film. And that's the truth. I gotta tell you, that's the truth. It's a damn good thing he finally got his own camera. Had it not been for that, he would have been just sticking his head in every chance he got and every time a camera was picked up or they heard the buzz of a camera shutter. TIM DORSEY: And he just happened to show up one day at Blackie August's house. He had just got out of the service. He was in the submarine service in Hawaii. And God, he was a good-looking guy-- blond hair, thin, he had kind of that twinkle in his every time you talked to him. There was something there. But I didn't know what was there, but it was there. BRUCE BROWN: You know, Huntington Pier was, like, well, Blackie August and Jack Haley and Chuck Hasley, a bunch of guys who were older. You're thinking, wow, these are really gool guys, because they had girls and drank wine and all these things that we thought was really neat. It was when Robert was just a-- probably six or eight years old. -I remember Bruce and a whole bunch of the other guys that were, like, the better surfers, that were surfing the pier at Huntington mainly. We lived right on the beach in Seal Beach, so there was always surfing in front of the house. The parties were always at our house. -I mean, there was every surfer from up and down the coast would pile through that house. And nobody went away hungry. They were unbelievable people. -It was Dad's house at 13th Street on the beach. You know, that was mission control headquarters. And Blackie had a home for wayward boys there. It wasn't intended, but everyone kind of came there, because Blackie was real with kids and just kinda took care of what was going on there and a lifestylist. ROBERT AUGUST: So dad was kind of everybody's hero. He was a good surfer for an older guy. And his lifestyle-- he had the balanced life thing. Work like hell so you can make some money so you can go play like hell. And all those guys kind of gravitated toward that same lifestyle. If you really pay some dues and get it together and make some money, you could have a lot of fun. And if you just screw around, you can only have this much fun. -And so I adopted the kind of Blackie August way of looking at it-- let's go out and have fun. And we had a lot of fun. STEVE PEZMAN: And he kind of fell into that whole filmmaking thing, probably just as a way to go surfing and make a living-- I mean, industrious, bright. -When I was in the service in Hawaii in the mid '50s-- and I had a little 8 millimeter camera, and we just took movies to come back and show people. Wow, here I am at [inaudible] or Sunset or something. I cut the thing, made a little movie, you know, a half hour movie or whatever it was. We'd show it at Dale Velzy's shop, and he'd charge, like, a quarter. And God, we'd make, like, $10 or something. -It got better each week. I said, why don't we do something with you? He says, what can we do? I said, what do I need to make a movie? -So he went and bought a camera. I'll never forget it. He walked into the camera store. He's got his big cigar. And-- you like that one, kid? Oh, yeah. What about that lens? Oh, yeah. Really. -I didn't even want to look at the price. Let's buy it. Let's go for it. And I think we can do something with it. BRUCE BROWN: That was-- we bought the camera and then loaded myself and five surfers on a plane, Rubber Band Airlines to Hawaii. And I had a little book, "How to Make Movies," and that was it. NARRATOR: Surfing is generally a non-competitive sport. Once in a while, the surfers will get together and have some informal competition. Here's friendly surfer Kemp Aaberg, friendly surfer Dewey Weber. The official starter says to begin. And Dewey Weber takes off on the first wave at Velzyland. Your partial to judges on the beach. They're screaming at Dewey Weber. You dirty cheater! He's riding in slow motion, which is illegal in this contest. -The surfing was unbelievable for the era. The boards were proving themselves. The guys were proving themselves. And he named a beach after me. That's Velzyland. And I was proud of that and still proud of it. -He was there. He was part of the crew that actually developed that. He named those places, you know? And that's history right there, you know? And it's pretty amazing. -You know, I always wanted to, you know, get a new spot. So we went-- we shot the first time at the pipeline. Phil went out. And we looked at if for a ling-- you know, years and just figured you wouldn't survive it. So he went out and rode a couple small waves and then rode a big one that scared the crap out of him. What are we gonna name this place? And Mike Diffenderfer was sitting on the beach with me. And I think there was a sign there that said something about a pipeline. I went, well, how about Pipeline? Plus it looked like a pipeline. NARRATOR: You hang onto your board. You go over the falls with it every time, guaranteed. Any wipeout at the Pipeline in Hawaii is a bad one. -You gotta understand, the worse we jab guys, the more we like them. BRUCE BROWN: Well, first of all, Greg would always go surfing. He'd put Bev, his wife, on the camera, and he'd go out and try and be a hero. -And Bruce was always a lot better at all of that technical stuff than I was. -But one day I was shooting side by side with Greg. And I think we're at Waiamea or something. And it was a huge day, and we were taking pictures. And Bruce had just gotten this stuff. And he was a little unsure. And he's going, say, Greg, he said-- -What F-stop are you using? He goes-- what's an F-stop? -I didn't want to give him an inch. You know, I was hoping his god damn film would come out black. -I said, well, you know, that's the little hole in the lens that you change for the light. -And I said, I just bought the camera at the camera store a couple years back. And the guy just set the thing for me, and I've never changed it. Are you supposed to change something? -But he had no problem because he only shot when the sun was out anyway. So it was F8 every time. NARRATOR: Greg Noll rode Waiamea Bay with such aggressiveness, he earned himself the nickname of The Bull, hanging on through unbelievable masses of whitewater. Only a handful of surfers actually ride these big waves. Some of them are sportsmen. Some of them are nuts. GREG NOLL: And Bruce is like Cecil B. De-Brown, you know? He combed his hair a little bit. And he got himself a nice car and some clean clothes. And man, he looked like a Hollywood guy. We really get you! BRUCE BROWN: Bob and I went to high school together. And he was a photographer guy-- a good one. So he was the only guy that I knew that knew anything about cameras and stuff. So when I got to the point where I needed to hire somebody, I called up Bob and said, hey man, you want to go to work for me? And so he did. And that lasted for quite a few years. He handled a lot of the businesses. And he'd be nice to people. And he was a good cameraman, a real good organizer, kind of production manager. We didn't have those terms, but that's what he would do. And real good at it. In fact, he went on to continue to do that. Still does. I had a little office in Dana Point. Paul Allen walked in one day and said, I want to work for you. I went, I can't afford to hire anybody. -I told him, I said, Bruce, if I don't make enough for you to afford me, then you don't have to pay me. -And I'll just take a percentage of what I make. And I went, oh, OK. And it went from there. The guy was just fantastic. -And I didn't leave any stone unturned. I went to the newspapers and used whatever angle I could to get, honestly, some coverage for the opening of the movie. And Bruce's movies were good. They were great. And the people just needed to know about it. We became a pretty good team. I would collect the tickets and sell the tickets and collect the money. And I would introduce Bruce, you dad, to the audience. And Pat, your mother, would run the projector. -I was tense, man. The thing might break. I can remember going to the show saying, oh, please don't break. Because everybody would start booing. Here I'm trying to re-threat the thing. -Bruce would stand up there and narrate the movie. -Sit on the stage with the music on a little tape recorder and play the tape. Just watch the movie on the screen. I had a little table there and sit beside the screen and narrate it. -And I used to go to his early movies. And they were real important events in the life of a surfer then. -It was the cultural of surfing. -He would rent a place like-- wherever it was, a hall. And all these surfers would come. And it was the event of the year, basically. -It was an event. We'd all look forward to it all week long. You'd get there early. You'd wear all your new surf clothes. You're just going, wow, this is so bitching that all these guys are here. -It was just a cultural madhouse that was so much fun. It was contagious. -I mean, they were wild-ass situations in those days. Guys would drive motorcycles and Miki Dora would bring fireflies and let them out. And they'd all charge the screen. -Of course, a lot of guys would bring bottle caps. And there'd be bottle cap wars. -Bottle caps. And they would start flicking at the screen if they didn't like the films. -Everybody'd be flicking bottle caps until the movie started. And then-- -And then after a while, they just started flicking it at the screen just because they wanted to flick it at the screen. -In Australia, they'd throw coke bottles, and it was a little more serious, but-- -You know, you'd age 20 years, just going through one session. -Oh, yeah. Well, Greg's movies were no good, you know, so he got just pelted with bottle caps. Mine were a little better, so they were nicer to me. -The one everybody wanted to see was Bruce. They wanted to see Bruce, because he had a little twist to it. There was always just a little twist to his films that made it click. TIM DORSEY: Every night they were played, it was packed. Rain, it was packed. Wind, packed. Fog, packed. We're all going to be there. I mean, it's just-- it was that surf stoke. -All this money in my hands from the tickets, selling tickets and stuffing it in our pockets, and-- -And we'd get home. We had a whole bunch. We'd just throw it up in the air and roll it. -We were just kids playing and not knowing what we're doing, just kind of every day doing the best we could. BRUCE BROWN: But you really couldn't afford to do a whole lot. We'd go to Hawaii and spend, like, three months. But then you could rent a house for, like, $75 and share it with five guys. -That was pretty adventurous. I mean, people were living in vans and vacant lots. That was a frontier for, like, California surfers. -So I'd take off usually in November when the swells started hammering through. And we'd go to the islands, let's say, generally until it pretty well crapped out in January. TIM DORSEY: There was really quite a camaraderie. And the North Shore, to be honest with you, was the place that would humble you. It would make you a believer. And I think that people have to understand that you weren't competing with yourself. You were competing with yourself to compete with nature. -A little tough making the transition from six foot South Bay to 20-plus Waiamea. TIM DORSEY: The equipment we were riding was junk. We had no leashes. I mean, we were just going out there to test our mettle, so to speak. Awful-- I mean, you just swim all day. You get one wave and then just swim all day. You get back to the beaches and say, I'm never going to go out. BRUCE BROWN: We'd spend maybe three months shooting and a couple, three months editing, and six months showing it. -Every year, we had to within a six-month period of time make a movie. Well, that's really hard to do. You've got to go out and film it. You've got to have an idea what you're gonna film. You have to have the music. And Bruce has to make the narration and put everything together and shoot it and everything within a six-month time, because we have to show it in the other six months to make enough money to make another movie. So you're just chasing your tail. BRUCE BROWN: There was "Slippery When Wet," "Surf Crazy," "Barefoot Adventure," "Surfing Hollow Days," and then "Water-Logged," which was a compilation of the old films plus some new stuff. -And that was our movie in 1963 while we were shooting "The Endless Summer." -And the reason for that was to two years to make the next film. Just because I thought, well, if I have more time, I could do a better job. It'll be a better film, and they will come. But we spent more money making it than we'd ever grossed on the rest of them. So from that standpoint, it probably didn't seem like a good idea to a lot of people. But I've always been kind of a dreamer. Oh, let's make a good one. And they'll come and see it. What the heck? ROBERT AUGUST: He had asked me if I wanted to go on a surf trip. He's going to make a movie. And I said, well, when? He said, well, it's going to be in-- probably leave in October. And I went, well, I can't. I'm going to school. I was pretty serious about school. Anyway, I talked to my mom and dad about this trip, you know, and thinking that they'd be negative about it. -I look back sometimes thinking, how-- you know, if somebody came to me that was 24 or something and said I want to take your kid around the world who was, like, 18, I think I might have been a little skeptical. -My mom and dad were always real supportive. They liked Bruce and admired him. -But Blackie? Oh, yeah, no problem. -So I went, yeah, hey. I'll be there. -When we checked on the tickets to South Africa, to get LA, Cape Town, back to LA, it was $50 more than going around the world via Cape Town. -Fortunately for this travel agent suggesting that to Bruce and coming up with a better price even, that is what made the truly remarkable movie, "The Endless Summer." -So that's how it happened. We saved the $50. And then sort of the summer thing came to my little pea brain, like, gosh, you know, it's summer in the Southern Hemisphere and it's winter here. Wow, if you just went around the circle long enough, you could stay right in the middle of summer the rest of your life. So that turned out to be, you know, the theme of the film. NARRATOR: The winter evening before their departure, in front of a warm fire, reading up on a few last-minute books on Africa, which would be their first stop. Robert August, Mile Hynson. GREG MACGILLIVRAY: In a lot of way, Bruce had quite a bit of wisdom in casting these two dissimilar characters in "The Endless Summer." You know, you had the blonde and you had the dark-haired. And you had the character who had a lot of style with the surfing, Hynson, who, his style was almost his essence. And Robert was kind of hang-loose and kind of carefree with the way he surfed. Both excellent surfers, but a real contrast in the water, but also on land. ROBERT AUGUST: When I was six or seven, I started surfing. And I surfed every day-- before school, after school, all summer long. My sister's husband was in the Navy and was stationed in Hawaii. So I was going to Hawaii every summer and every Christmas and basically surfed a lot. GREG MACGILLIVRAY: Besides being one of the most brilliant guys in surfing, he's just a really genuine, straightforward, honest guy. -Robert, you want get in a car and take a 100-mile drive with him, and you enjoy every minute of it. -Robert August probably is-- for me, he's an example of how to live your life. -He's just sort of figured it out. He's fine-tuned his life to the way he likes it. And I guess I hope that I could pull it off in that same way. BRUCE BROWN: Robert was always-- he was a real good student and didn't ditch school, like most of the surfers of the day did, if the surf was good. He was, like, president of the student body or something. STEVE PEZMAN: Robert and Bruce, there was some thing-- I mean, they come from different generations. But there's some connection there, I think. They're both real genuine. They don't pretend to be something they aren't, comfortable with who they are. -You'd have Robert, who would give you his last dime or the shirt off his back. And you'd have Hynson, who just was different. I don't want to go any further, but he was a different kind of character. He was more involved with himself. And that's what made him interesting, is that he had this kind of regal flair to him. -He was one of the most melodramatic persons around at that time. He had the dress deal. He had the cologne. He had a whole group of followers behind him that followed, wanted to ride boards like him, comb his hair like him. -He was-- he was great. I mean, he is a real-- he used to call him Helmet Head because of the way he combed his hair. And he was real cocky, but not in an offensive way at all. And a real good surfer and a good guy to travel with. And he sort of marched to the beat of a different drummer slightly. But he was great. I just had a wind-up Bolex camera and a suitcase full of film and some lenses and a tripod. So we could basically carry everything. So we'd just go shoot. That's what we had always done. And I didn't really know any better. And you know, we're young and dumb and all that. But we had suits and ties and tried to make it look like we were respectable people. NARRATOR: On the plane heading for Africa, Robert wondered what was in store for them. Would they find surf? Would they catch malaria? Would they be speared by a native? He didn't have any idea. ROBERT AUGUST: Next thing I know, we're on a plane on the way to New York and then just stopped there and changed planes and blitzed straight for Senegal. I had no idea where Senegal was. That's some baseball player's name or something-- Joey Senegal, coming up to bat. Next thing I know, we're there. And it's a French place. And nobody speaks any English. They either speak some local language or French, you know? BRUCE BROWN: You know, in the movie it shows a fancy French place that they made us stay at. We went out and went surfing out in the point there. And the native kids and people were cheering. And we'd go back to the hotel, thinking, well, maybe now somebody will buy us a free meal or something. And all these French guys were sitting out in the patio in their little bikinis and drinking mineral water or something. And as we came up, they all turned their back. It's like-- like, we're not impressed with you idiots, you know? -God, it turned into this colossal adventure, you know, for an 18-year-old kid. BRUCE BROWN: That was before any high-tech. We were high-tech because we had a map. We'd go, there's a point. That might be a good place. NARRATOR: Can you imagine driving in a highway on the US like that? They'd put you in prison. They made it to a little hotel without the boards falling out, congratulating the driver for being such a good packer. He really liked Mike and Robert-- didn't even charge them for the ride and offered to spend a couple of days with them, showing them around his country of Ghana. -Well, we had no clue what we were getting into. And the cab, we just said, take us to the beach. And we probably had some still photos of surfing and pointed to them. So he took us there. We just got out-- and you know, just mobs of people. It was a little scary. We didn't quite know, you know, if they were going to like us or hate us or what the deal was. So they went out and went surfing. And I was just on the beach rolling the camera. And just the crush of the people, especially the kids-- you know, you'd go to pan and bonk somebody in the head. They were just leaning up against you. And they're looking at themselves in the lens, the reflection and stuff. I think they took that canoe out just to show off. I'm not really sure, because we didn't, you know, speak the language. But I think they saw them surfing, they were just going, hey man, check this out. They got out their salad forks and off they went. And we were totally dazzled, because they were water-oriented. And they knew the surf. And kids had their little belly boards and stuff. It was amazing. PAUL ALLEN: That scene at the West Africas, where Mike and Robert go down on the beach, to this day, is the most incredible, highly remembered scene of that movie. NARRATOR: There are surfers in South Africa. John Whitmore is the leader of the group in Cape Town. John makes surfboards and sells Volkswagens. There are about 100 surfers around Cape Town. And when Mike and Robert arrive, all 100 of them took the day off to go surfer. -John was like the Volkswagen dealer and surfed. So that was a contact. And I got a hold of John. Oh, come on down, man. It's cool. And so we did. And he had sort of organized some stuff for us to show us where the surf spots were on Cape Town, knew the guys up in Durban and all that. So if we went where we went, you know, we'd have some help, where we're not just wandering around, wondering where to go. Great guy. And then he's the one that introduced us to Terrence. And Terrence agreed to take us on a big long safari tour. So he took us around. And he didn't know anything about surfing or the surf spots. But he took us to the different places. John told us to go to this place. And they had these little rondavels that were, like, $4 a night. So that fit our-- it came with a horse. So they're out surfing at that place. And I'm shooting some pictures, going, you know, typical deal. You go all around, you never really get as good a surf as you can find at home. -I was just sitting on the beach, talking to Bruce and whatever and watching Mike surf. And he was shooting some pictures. And Mike came in and said, I'm going to go out. I want to check that wave out. And we're going, oh, Mike. He's-- you know. You look, it's just whitewater pounding on some rocks. -I look up at the beach, and you see these little peelers coming. -So we loaded up all the stuff and film and gear. And I was walking with Bruce, carrying stuff and my board. And Mike paddled. And the closer we got to the point there, we got a little angle where we could see these waves. And Bruce sets the tripod up. And Mike drops into a wave. And we just go, holy cow, look at this. NARRATOR: You can't tell how good a wave is till you actually ride it. On Mike's first ride, the first five seconds, he knew he'd finally found that perfect wave. The waves looked like they had been made by some kind of a machine. The rides were so long I couldn't get most of them on one piece of film. Here's Mike, further along, still riding the same wave at Cape St. Francis. ROBERT AUGUST: So all of a sudden, we're riding the best waves we'd ever ridden in our lives. And it was a total surprise. It wasn't like we're going to go to this place we heard about and check it out. It's like, nobody had ever surfed there before. We surfed till we were just dead. I can remember vomiting in the water, part being tired and part being excited. BRUCE BROWN: This was like the best way we'd ever found. That only lasted for, like, maybe an hour or two. And the tide came in or changed, and that was the end of it. -So then that afternoon, he made us climb up and down those sand dunes 20 times. BRUCE BROWN: You know, these dunes, I had to use them somehow. So the spur of the moment, I'm going, oh, OK. Well, it's Lawrence of Arabia coming over the dunes. And they didn't want to do it. They were tired, and it was hot. -Near mutiny, you know? Boiling. It looked hot in the movie. It was really hot. -This far dune. And oh, by the way, we can't have any footprints, so you gotta go all the way around. And they were really whining about that. Here, go over here and slide down again, where there's a fresh trail, no footprints. Climb back up and come down the other side. Oh, sure. Do you know how much my board weighs, Bruce? Do you know how tired I am? I just barfed in the water. I have no food. Water-- no water. That's OK. Just climb right up there. You're young. OK, that's fair. I'll claim back up there. -Well, I never said it was. It was kind of like, hey. NARRATOR: When you go looking for a surf, you don't look for a really big wave. If you found one, you'd never ride it in strange waters. It would be much too dangerous. What every surfer dreams of finding is a small wave with perfect shape, what we call a perfect wave. The odds against finding that are 10 million to 1. They finally got their first look at Cape St. Francis, South Africa. BRUCE BROWN: The actual thing was-- it doesn't make for a very good sound bite. And like I say, a lot of "The Endless Summer" is the feel of the thing. That's the emotion we had, was the discovery. Like I say, we had done that kind of stuff a million times. And most of the time, it's just disappointing. NARRATOR: A group of Australian blokes took Mike and Robert with them on a surfing trip. They drove over 1,000 miles in four days looking for surf. Everywhere they went, they were greeted with a familiar cry surfers have heard 1,000 times each. Quote, "You guys really missed it. You should have been here yesterday." -Here we are in Australia, and we're hanging around with these guys. And there was just no surf at all. We were there. It was the only surf we had which wasn't that great. But it was the stuff that Paul shot, with Rodney and Nat. He'd been showing my earlier films down there anyway, you know, in Australia. By then, we were getting big time and started putting soundtracks on the stuff. So he was like my Australian distributor. And I think he maybe just wrote and said he was going to get a camera and take some pictures, and would I be interested? Yeah, sure. NARRATOR: Rodney said the surf isn't the same either, and obviously it isn't. He told them of all the great days of surf he and Nat Young had had riding Bells Beach. Nat Young here, only 16 years old, and one of the very finest surfers in Australia. -I went on this tour with Paul Witzig. And I had never met Bruce Brown. So it was basically Paul taking me to Western Australia. What we'd do is we'd put on the show in, say, Perth. And then we'd put that on for a week. And then the money from that would finance the next part of the trip to go down south. And it was a great trip, because we loaded up a Commie wagon full of cameras, projectors, because we had to do the actual-- we were doing the show. We were the roadies. NARRATOR: Let's see what it looks like now when you're actually in the water riding, as we watch the amazing footwork of Mr. Phil Edwards in Hawaii. BRUCE BROWN: It was just sort of the early days of that water photography. There was nothing you could buy at the time. And so we had this guy make us a Plexiglas housing for a wind-up Bell & Howell. -With suction cups on the bottom and a little lever where you flicked it on. And then on the other side you could wind it. So we just suction cupped it on the nose of my board and rode some waves and clicked it on. It was pretty awkward with this camera thing up there. But it's so close, you can't really tell what's going on, whether I was surfing good or not. BRUCE BROWN: We had all kinds of things we tried to invent. We had, like, a football helmet with a camera on the top, which would about break your neck, trying to use that. We got a little magazine load, wind-up camera that takes 50-foot little-- which was real small. And we built a little plastic case for it that was, you know fairly small. And they could actually surf with the thing-- you know, shoot your feet or do this or do that, whatever. -Stupid little things that you'd go, well, that's never gonna work. But then you'd put it in on a surfing film, where people are in a good mood, and it's a carefree environment already, that they're ready for that kind of a thing. And "The Endless Summer" kind of carried that charming quality of humor further-- whether it's jumping quickly on the beach at Cape St. Francis or the guys in Africa, looking over at the gas station, where the sign says, "A gip." Riding in the rickshaw, where the guy goes up in the air, because they have so much weight in the back with their surfboards. -And your dad's basically pretty silly and corny at times. And little kids just think it's great. NARRATOR: They called this place El Stumpo. They named it El Stumpo after the famous Polynesian explorer, Leonardo El Stumpo. -You'd show surfing, and then you'd have comic relief. Or you'd have a little bit of travel. And then you'd get back to the surfing. -What makes-- what makes Bruce Bruce, I think, is his sense of humor and his storytelling. -We had little trout fishing stuff. And when you shoot it, you don't know if you're going to use it or how you're going to use it or whatever. But we got back and then, well, we frequently had a little fire and cooked out. But we didn't have any shots, so we just got some calico bass or something and put them on a stick and built a fire in the backyard at our house and shot that part there. NARRATOR: They had enough fish for weeks. They had trout for dinner, trout sandwiches for lunch, flaked trout on their mush in the morning, rotten trout. -Because Bruce can make something fun out of nothing. He's got a knack for it. -You know, and the surf would be down. And you'd just be sitting there, kind of-- gotta do something. -Yeah, basically I was the closest guy who didn't mind being made a fool of, so-- NARRATOR: You get off the path, you never find your way out. This was a full-on jungle, full of all kinds of creepy things-- snakes, spiders. They expected Tarzan to come swinging by on a vine. -We got Paul Allen and just painted him all up and had a shield I think I brought back from somewhere. PAUL ALLEN: Well, that was just-- Pat, your mom, put that on. That was just black shoe polish. And that was all done on location in Dana Point, California, at the third bush to the left from your house. -And what's the old saying? You can't make a fur coat out of a pig's ear? Well, I tell you, Bruce can do anything. I mean, I just think that he's brilliant. -Africa, Australia, Tahiti-- I mean, places that you could only dream of. I mean, it was such an imaginative trip for a lot of us that I don't think a lot of us have really recovered from that film, because we're all still looking for the endless summer today. GREG MACGILLIVRAY: It told all of the emotions and wonder of finding surf when you never expect to find it. And that's part of the joy of surfing, is going to the beach every day, never expecting it to be good but hoping that it's just great. And then one out of 30 days, you find it really good. And that's part of being a surfer. BRUCE BROWN: We'd try them out on people. And "The Endless Summer?" And it was like, what the-- -He tried a few other things, I'm sure, before he settled on that. -But you know, I liked it. And my wife liked it. -I didn't like it. I'm going, nobody says "endless." BRUCE BROWN: When Columbia Pictures did the worldwide distribution, they hated the poster. They're going, God, Brown, this poster just sucks. And we have all these genius people that do stuff, much more appealing than that. So they did their version of the poster. I mean, I'm looking at the thing going, holy mackerel. This is a joke. But they all wanted to do the same thing. They always wanted to throw a few girls on the poster or try and make it look more like "Beach Blanket Bingo" or something, which you're kind of going, don't you get it? The reason it's popular is it's not like that. It's its own little thing. -I remember the first we saw it, just in his cutting room there, the shots of "The Endless Summer," that we were going, this is not just a regular surf film. NARRATOR: With enough time and enough money, you could spend the rest of your life following the summer around the world. But for now, the endless summer must end. This is Bruce Brown. Thank you for watching. I hope you enjoyed my film. BRUCE BROWN: I remember the first time we showed it, when it was over, there was just total silence. And I thought, oh, crap. We've made a dog after all this work, and they hate it. And there was just about 30 seconds of silence, and then everybody started cheering and clapping and stuff. -The surfers basically saw it on the lecture circuit, and they saw it over and over and over. People would go to the auditoriums as long as your dad was showing the film. -And the next day, you could go down to the beach, and it just, like, unbelievable. Everybody would just communicate on the beach. Did you see that film last night? Yeah. Wasn't that awesome? And the guys would go out on the water, and the gals would go out on the water, and they'd surf until they dropped. -So it was a phenomenal draw, which is what sort of made us think that it might go on a national basis in theaters and stuff. Making a movie is real serious to me. But the business part of it, especially with Hollywood or New York or whatever, is like a joke. I mean, it's like monopoly. So they play the game. And being a surfer, I could play that game too. -Bruce is a great pumper-upper. If I didn't want to do it, somehow or another, he and Pat could pump me up to where I want to do it. -If someone says to me, you'll never work in Hollywood again, I mean, it makes me laugh. Because I never worked in Hollywood to begin with, and who gives a damn? I don't want to work there anyway. -Because I didn't want to go to New York, and he pumped me up to go. And I went. And the first time I went, these guys looked at the movie, about three or four Warner Brothers, United Artists, Paramount, and they looked at the movie. And the first words out of their mouth was, hm, well, it'll never go 10 minutes from the water. -We ended up renting a theater in Wichita, Kansas, in the middle of the winter. -A theater that had been closed down. The last show they had shown there, I think, was "My Fair Lady." The day of the opening of the movie, the worst thing in the world happened. The biggest snowstorm in the history of Wichita, Kansas, hit Wichita. I'll never forget it-- looking out and seeing nothing but white. And I'm going, oh my god. This is not going to work. I got there. You'd see the marquee. The icicles on the marquee, "The Endless Summer." What an irony that was. And here's a line of people around the block, waiting in snow up to their knees, to go in. We sold out every single night for the week. I held it over for a second week, sold it out the second week. The theater owners couldn't believe it. They wrote a letter, saying, hey, this movie is fantastic. The people came out of the woodwork for this, in the middle of the worst snowstorm in the history of Wichita, Kansas. -So we thought, that proves it. That's as far away from the ocean as you can get, Wichita, Kansas. -I went back to New York City armed with all this great stuff. Big guys in New York City knew everything, right? It was a fluke. -And New York is really provincial. If it doesn't happen in Manhattan, it never happened. -I'll never forget the guy riding down in the elevator with me, a big cigar in his mouth, saying, hey, listen kid, I got $3,000 I'll give you for that. I said, no thanks. We make that in one show, you know? -So we thought, aha. We'll go rent a theater in New York. -And do it ourselves. If you want to go to New York and promote it, Paul, you could do it. Pump, pump, pump. You know how to do this. Look what you did in Wichita. Pump, pump, pump. -So we blew it up to 35 millimeter, rented this theater in New York, Kips Bay Theater. -He borrowed the money. He borrowed the money from our local backers, [inaudible], probably the poor guy that owns the money, he was worried about it, but he had faith in us. -Everyone in the surf industry thought, oh yeah, yeah. It's just not going to work. They'll come back to town with their tail between their legs. -We're both thinking, boy, what have we done? And how are we going to pay this money back to the bank? And the movie opened-- opened to incredible reviews. -And then we started seeing the reviews in magazines and newspapers. Pauline Kael, who was the number one reviewer in the country, loved "The Endless Summer." -So we got all kinds of publicity from the press. And we were on the Johnny Carson show. And we were saying in some flea bag hotel. And we get a call from the distributor going, we'll send a limo for you. Where are you staying? And we'd go, oh, we're staying at the Hilton. What room? Oh, we'll just meet you out front. So we'd go stand out in front of the Hilton, get in the limo, go to the guy. Then we started finding out there were better hotels. So we started standing in front of really the high-didge hotels. Yeah, we're at the Sherry-Netherland. It's the top floor. We'll meet you out in front. -Of course, they're there to buy it. But none of them wanted to do it our way. We were now in the driver's seat. We said, well, yeah, you can have the movie to distribute, but you have to do it our way. Oh, no no no. We're going to put a couple of bikini girls on the poster, and we have some ideas of how we want to do this. -They go, well, Brown, first of all, you need to put more chicks in there. And we need a little love interest. And they were just going to change it to the point where they were gonna ruin it. -And then along came Don Rugoff of Cinema 5 who said, I want to know who did this promotion. And I won't buy the movie and/or distribution rights unless he does it and goes to every city and opens it. And that's my final offer. -He was a sharp guy. He figured out probably how much we were in debt. And here's a check, a $50,000 advance, which was how much we were in debt. -The Vietnam thing was just happening. And there was a lot of misery going on, a lot of doubt, a lot of negative stuff going on. And all of a sudden, here's this goofy, happy surf movie, just wandering the planet, having fun. What a break. GREG MACGILLIVRAY: It became a major motion picture and took not only the surfing world by storm but changed the way everyone in the world looked at surfing. And all of a sudden, surfing was a respectable thing to do. -After "The Endless Summer," they went, oh, you're a surfer. So it was an interesting thing. It was like a threshold that the sport went through. -Because that's the one thing that they hadn't seen. They hadn't seen a movie that was really a documentary that told you what real surfing was about. It wasn't Hollywood's version of surfing. -It epitomized what we were really doing, not the phony Hollywood part of surfing. It really got down to the core of what we were really doing. -I envisioned what happened happening. But had it not happened, I wouldn't have been surprised either. -That guy, every friend that I met from all over that I was skiing with, Bruce Brown, "Endless Summer," that's what it was like. Because other than that, all they ever saw was the "Beach Party Bingo" movies. And that was like, oh, this is what really surfing is about. -Even though he was only on camera once or twice in the film, he was the star. And that's what made that film work. -Most of the publicity would come out like I'm rich. Well, I hadn't seen any money yet, other than enough to pay the bank off. And I keep reading these articles in "Life" magazine and "Time" and Rich Dad, [inaudible] dad. And I didn't have any money. I'm saying, boy, I hope this is true, because-- -I know his favorite ones was, he'd say, guys say, you're really lucky. And he says, where were they at 4:00 in the morning when I was working and editing my films? ROBERT AUGUST: And I'll run into somebody somewhere that sees me for the first time. And it's like they think they know me because they've watched this thing over and over. Wow, I got to meet him. Yeah, aren't you thrilled? ROBERT WEAVER: I get a phone call. It was January 15, 1:15 in the afternoon. And the phone rings at my house. This is Bruce Brown. Is Wingnut there? Yeah. Well, we're thinking about doing a sequel to "The Endless Summer." We wanted to know if you wanted to be one of the two guys. Uh, yeah, well, I gotta do laundry and mow the lawn, but in about 45 minutes, I can be ready. -Well, I was working with my dad, putting together some of his old surf movies. -So after several months of that, maybe a couple of other little things we did, these people kept coming by, you know, what about making the sequel and this and that. -And he decided we should do "Endless Summer 2." -And collaborating with somebody that was on the same page-- which most people aren't, at least with me. -If he ever gets mad at me, he blames me for taking years off of his life, coming out of retirement. -Your fault. STEVE PEZMAN: No one chronicles surfing with quite the same spirit as the Brown family. I mean, you can look at surfing any way you want. It's like a Congressional Record. You can find anything you want in it. So I like what Bruce and Dana find in surfing, to point out, to be interested in, to look and be kinda stoked on who we are as surfers. -The time where I realized that wow, this is really happening is when I got to the airport for the first trip to Costa Rica. And they handed me my ticket. And it was all the boxes stacked, the luggage, and all the film stuff. And that's when I finally realized, wow, this is really happening. I looked on the ticket, saw my name. I'm like, that's right. That's right. -And then all of a sudden, it was like, deja vu. We're going somewhere on another surf trip, making a movie from 35 years before, when I was a little kid. We're doing the same thing, but just different. -Like I say, most of the stuff I'd done, my wind-up Bolex. Here there's other people working. And I'm going, this is cool, man. -I mean, it was so different. The first film was, jeez, you know, Mike and Bruce and I and a suitcase full of film. God, when we went to Costa Rica, it was like a full film crew. And every day, those guys had a plan to shoot. When the sun's out, we're working. -They were talented people. Their heart was behind the project. They never complained. I'd be going, god, maybe you ought to take a break. And they'd go, oh no, it's OK, man. I want to keep doing this. And with big heavy 35 millimeter stuff. -It was a cool thing to see it happen. BRUCE BROWN: Oh, they were great-- both of them. Just couldn't ask for two better guys. They would never say I'm cold or I'm scared and I don't want to drive the wrong way on the one way street or the crocodile's going to get me or anything like that. -Oh, my god. And I don't like creepy things like that. I don't like snakes. I don't like iguanas. Spiders-- I don't like that kind of stuff, man-- straight up. Standing on cliffs and pretending to look over the thing-- I'm sorry, I'm just not down with that. Airplanes crashing and stuff. -That was an easy flight. Let's go surfing. -Let's go. -Thanks a lot. -Hey, man. Thanks a lot. That was a radical flight. -I mean, this is a risky job here, dude. I didn't realize. I thought I was just going surfing, you know? -As a surfer, if you can go through your life and meet certain heroes, surf certain places, I got to do all that in a year and a half. I mean, it was just given to me. -Together, with yourself and Bruce, we decided what we were going to do. It sounded good. And then we were towing a bit of bloody plastic on the back of the car. Or we were going to ride away. It ended up being the smallest wave in the world. And I was given pretty much license in the Bruce Brown style, as you know, in Australia, to do anything I wanted. NARRATOR: When I made my last surf film in 1964, there were only four countries in the world where people surfed. Today, surfers are riding waves in virtually every country in the world that has a coastline. -It's always tough to make a sequel. And everybody's ready to criticize any sequel. Oh, I like the original one better. -So "The Endless Summer 1," had something it could do that would never happen again. -We thought that Bruce with "Endless Summer 1" had done the ultimate. It was the top. But then "Endless Summer 2" came along and surprised all of us. -I thought that it was the finest surf movie ever made. ROBERT AUGUST: The first time I ever saw it, like on the big screen, I got goosebumps. It's incredible, the way the guys surf. God, I love watching it. But it also showed that the sport's basically the same. It's goofy people having fun, riding a wave, no rules. You know, people can relate to that and think, oh god, wouldn't that be fun, if me and my friend could do that? And a lot of people are doing it these days, you know? They work like hell and save some money, get a couple friends, and they go do that. -I can't tell you how many letters that I've gotten where people are so excited about the movie that they learned to surf because of that movie. Or they moved to the coast and they love it, and stuff like that. And that's the stuff that really gets me stoked. And it's funny, because I think when the movie first came out, I didn't really notice anything like that. Now there's new generations of surfers coming up where "The Endless Summer 2" is the same as it was for people a long time ago, like "The Endless Summer 1." And so what's happened is kids watch that movie religiously. So many times, oh, I've watched it 100 times, or whatever. And it's like, people see that as-- it's the same thing. -People watch "The Endless Summer 2" over and over, like they did "The Endless Summer 1." So they get the same reaction with Wingnut. You know, wow, I've seen that movie 14 times. So when both of us are together, it's kind of a double whammy. They're just overwhelmed with nostalgia. -To get to be a part of something that is surf history, I mean, it's just become a part of the culture. And it's such a huge deal. And it's opened so many doors for me, which has given me a lot of opportunity. -I mean, WIngnut could have stepped up a little bit. But other than that, it was great, I think. -Oh, God. He's gonna love that. Wingnut, we really get him. NARRATOR: With enough time and enough money, you could spend the rest of your life following the summer around the world. This is Bruce Brown. Thank you for watching. I hope you all enjoyed our film. TIM DORSEY: You realize how far ahead of his time he was. I mean, they're treasures. He was recording a lifestyle that has changed dramatically. Now it's a sport. Now it's a profession. Now it's an industry. Whereas at the time, it was just a lifestyle. HOBIE ALTER: I don't know how to explain, because he's got this unbelievable sense of humor, a really loyal type of friend. He's a friend for life. -You know, we're still good friends. I still really look forward to seeing him. I wish I could see him more often. I'm trying to get him to go to Costa Rica with us, just to surf and golf and have some fun, not filming anything. -He's one of my best friends. I've never argued with him, except saying, how much money? -Oh, I love him. I mean, I love Bruce. With your mom, with Patty, it was-- they were just wonderful people. Always-- good spirit. ROBERT WEAVER: I mean, he just watches out for me now. And he's real honest about things with me, which I really appreciate. You know, my father passed away when I was really young, so I don't have that. So I really appreciate you and your brother and sister sharing dad with me. I really enjoy that. It means a lot to me. -A great filmmaker-- probably the most influential documentary filmmaker, one of the three or four, in the history of cinema. I'm not putting that in, Dad, by the way. TOY: I'll bomb Baghdad, I'll bomb France, if you'll remove my underpants. -I got it for Bill. TOY: Hey, baby. I got some AstroTurf in the back of my El Camino. -Your movie's a little-- do you know what I mean if that makes any sense. MALE SPEAKER: Well, if you had-- -Short, concise answers. -Like, if it was fun to drive, he got to drive and do the walkie talkie, you know? But the crappy stuff, I had to drive, and he got the walkie talkie. Like, he always had the fun stuff, you know? I'm still pissed off about that obviously. It's been 10 years, and I'm still that pissed. -I wanted to get good at it. God, the Japanese guys are loud! MALE SPEAKER: Sorry. -We're doing TV. -I think Bruce is like this really nice guy, and Dana's an [bleep].
