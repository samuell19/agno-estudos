Schiwago Film presents I’m a part of the society. Exactly. A part of it. I’m a part... ...of the society... ...built on ideals. I live in society which has lost its ideals. The whole concept of a just society collapsed. All right, man. I want to help the others find the courage in themselves, become responsible for their actions. Let them know that there is actually somebody who fights for their beliefs. Are you nuts? - Asshole. - There is an 80 km/h speed limit. You are not on a speedway. Get in. It’s going to cost you 100 Euro. What if you caused am accident? DISREGARDING RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR DRIVING THE MOTOR VEHICLES. Fine. In order for this lesson to be effective we need to do one thing more, though. If we don’t, then you’re probably going to drive fast again. Unscrew the driving wheel, please. This key should fit right in. Come on, be quick about it. Do you have the slightest idea how many people die annually on Brandenburg roads? Thousands! Because of assholes like you who don’t give a shit about regulations. Here are your documents. And here’s my driving wheel. I’m alone. I’ve always been. On 24th July, 1972 I was torn from my mother’s belly. She had an accident. She died on her way to the hospital. Of course that’s not true. But everybody lies to attract people. Or to pretend they’re actually somebody else that they truly are. I don’t know. I can’t behave like that. I’m different. QUIET AS A MOUSE Gerd used to say he liked cheesecakes. He’s been unemployed for years. He actually looks for work but he doesn’t want it to be casual. He’s looking for work that would require responsibility. That’s why I’m going to hire him as my assistant. - Did you pour yourself some coffee? - No... That’s for you. - The cheesecake? - No, that’s the camera. You’re going to record criminals that I capture. Last year there were 683 free riders caught, 413 thieves in shops, and 13... no, one of them was my mistake, 12 cases of morality offence. I’m planing to release that material with some commentary and with a manifest I’ve been working on for some time how. kind of a quick society revival course. What I demand of you are intuition, psychology and susceptibility. Do you possess those skills? I do. That’s great. I like your sense of responsibility and your dedication to our work. You’ve got three months to prove your words. After that you’ll receive your contract and all the necessary services. Do you have any questions? Yes. When do I begin? I catch 60-80 people weekly. All of them are unpredictable. In any moment each one of them may hurt somebody or even kill. I catch all of them red-handed or thanks to my informers’ work. These are authentic pnotos. No improvisation. All faces can be well seen. For admonition. Good day. Your ticket, please. One moment. FREE RIDING. - I forgot to buy one today. - You forgot? I’ve got a monthly one. I left it at home. - It’s my first time. - Do you have 15 Euro on you? I’ll give you a chance. I can sell you a monthly ticket for 15 Euro. Your documents. And 15 Euro. 30 Euros for all of you. 10 each, so it’s 30. Jack. We’ve got to pay him. You’re coning from America? From New York? I have to say something. This day, when the Twin Towers crashed, it was really horrible. That day we were all, here in Germany, we said, we were all Americans. We’re South Africans. Oh, so this is my fault. Excuse he. I thought so because you’re speaking English... Thank you. Is that right that you have porno films with horses in South Africa? - No. - I thought so. In America they do. Thank you. Have a nice day, here in Berlin. When was the last time you were on leave? I chose Gerd because he reminded he of my dog that had died recently before the wall went down. His eyes. Loyal, never hade a first hove, he had the worst CV. He tried to do a cook’s course. Failed. Suicidal attempt. Some time spent at the care house. Ah extraordinary example of a person who did not achieve a single thing in his life. I didn’t work so I couldn’t afford one. And my wife left he. Since them... That’s why I’m so happy you gave he a chance. Don’t you have physical training at school? You got too much energy? - And you are? - Nahe’s Mux. And just what are you going to do with us, punk? - Want to fight? - Sure. Gerd, it’s going to be great. Record it. keep your guard. Show him! Enough. 1, 2, 3, let he go. Eat less fries. Maybe them you’ll be able to get yourself a girl. Instead of wanking all the time and disturbing people you don’t know. That was am innocent joke. Like from the school times. What about that fat-ass, eh? Blast it, I’ll have to get myself a hew suit. Let’s. We’ll go by tram. Nobody was buying Rheinhetall stock in the 80s because they had been producing mines that were later sent to Iraq. But nowadays? lf there is a profit them people purchase anything. What pisses he off the host is the fact that I’m right but the world won’t change. Or maybe. No, we can change something. We can help people restore their pride. Pride in not that they’re German or something. I meant the feeling of inner consistency, aim. Responsibility. Readiness for working for the others. We’ll teach them how to say ‘‘ho’’. Your tickets, please. It’s no longer valid. - Your ticket, please. - You got one? Let’s see. I don’t. - What’s your name? - Maria. They’re going to check your tickets next station. - You’re a sponger. - I know. - What about the consequences? - You’re getting a fine. - Turn off the camera. - We’re recording a documentary. Turn it off, how! Get sober and go home. You stink. If I catch you again beers won’t help you. is that clear? You can’t work without gas during the night. But I’m proud of myself because there’s 10% less recidivists... People understand that they’re doing something wrong. That parasitizing is unacceptable. Another... ...small piece of the social puzzle has just been fit in. Let’s take a break. I’ve got to think. What do you do with people you catch for the second time? They’re punished until they understand. Recidivists are very intelligent. I am usually unpleasant to such people. But it’s really a rarity. What I’m very proud of. Is it still on? Recidivists are usually those people that are the least educated. I don’t know why but these are the facts. Where’s the tape, you asshole? Get out! Wno was that? You know, that happens. I’m not much of a hero. Every country has heroes it deserves. Michael Schumacher is a hero. Because he drives fast and doesn’t pay the taxes. That’s the way our country works. - That’s a place for the disabled. - 5 minutes and we’re out. You’re having a stop for the young one to take a pee? If so I’ll make an exception. But don’t do it any more. I could use some more helpers. - I’ll give you a job, what do you think, Max? - I’m Martin. - This is Mux. - Thanks, I’m retired. - What do you sell? - Morale and order. Morale. One more. Now that’s morale. I guess you’re doing very well? - Not bad, I must admit. - Bravo, boy. Cheers. Don’t you have some free ones? Excuse me. Yes? Did you read ‘‘Faust’’? No. HOW TO READ KANT’S BOOKS. She’s gone. Soly. Is it original? Sure. The best stuff we have. Hakam and Feriduh! I recorded everything and I don’t care that we are neighbours. How dare you do that right under my window?! You won’t escape anyway. Technology can be quite useful but the host important thing is to understand how people think. Because if you do, them you can help them. It’s simply dialectic. ‘‘Street Workers’’. Come, Gerd. Give it back. Stick yourself to the wall. What’s wrong with you, guys? It’s the Social Revival Movement. Please leave a message. My name’s Karl Zitker. Bernd said you were looking for helpers. My number is... My account number did not change. I’ll fax it to you right away. Sort it alphabetically. So you want the homey. It’s Dehis, my informer. He worked very well this month. Where’s my pen? 18 times for 60 Euro each. About the biker whose shoulder you broke... - Do it one more time... - He was riding on the pavement. And you’ll no longer work for me. Do not use force. About Rothert... - He was riding on the pavement. - It doesn’t matter. Take 20 euro and buy a wine for him. I’ll check whether you have done so. Fax is coming. Fuck off. I can’t see anything. Working with the juvenile doesn’t bring too many positive results. Especially those from 87 and 88 are... Now what? Stop! And what are you going to do? It was at least 70 km/h and there’s a speed limit of 35 here. Assholes. Those train men are such motherfuckers. There was no chance he would have survive that. He did not probably even see the train coning. I think I’m going to throw up. Here you go. You don’t have to be so stiff. Well, at least I’m not. - What do you think, how old I am? - I don’t know. Am I handsome? Do you have a habit of asking aliens about such things? I’m a traveller. I try to record everything I see. Maybe one day people will say that I had been right. When I was of your age I thought the world was nice. I don’t think so. Yes you do. You have a fresh outlook. Don’t let them take that away from you. Give it a break. Don’t fall into that swamp. It was a wonderful day. I really enjoy spending my time with you. Hundreds of guys would like to be he right how. But you should know that... I’m different. How come? Because I respect you. You and your body. Sure, I could... penetrate you. Right? You’re odd. That’s right. I could but it would ruin everything. You’re young. And very beautiful. Like the Sun... that looks through the clouds. Can you hear the horses knocking? It’s a knight in shining armour. And I am him. Maybe that’s stupid... but that’s the way I would like it to be. And you would be my princess. Many well-known works of literature were inspired by women. Unusual women. I would lie to you if I hadn’t told you that that’s the way I feel right how. When we’re sitting here together. Don’t say a thing. Don’t you know who I am? A man of your life. This is the end of other men. I trust you. The whole evening awaits. Isn’t that wonderful? I’ll drive you home. I’ve got lots of work tomorrow. Good day, children. - Good day, Mr. Mux. - Mr. Bux. Today we’re going to have a social education lesson. Do you have the necessary school books with you? Lately we’ve been talking about solidarity. Today we’re going to discuss the problem of responsibility. What does this word mean? Wno wants to be first? He doesn’t even know how to spell it. Stupid Turk. Enough, Edgar. That could happen to everyone. Edgar! You’re a ring-leader. This is the last time I’m warming you. See? It’s not fun at all. Nobody likes when people are laughing at them. Sit down. And take off the mask. I guess you understand how that you should never behave like that. That’s what responsibility is all about. Today is a very important day for Edgar. You’re like puppies. But you all want to grow up. Good bye, Mister. So here are our main informers who inform us about free riders: Torsten, Mark - very hard-working and he’s got a mobile. Mr. Mux? - Mrs... - Sabetsky. - Do you remember he? - Of course. I’m one of your first ‘‘converts’’. And this ham is Gerd Grabowsky. He helps he. He used to do everything by himself but the times got worse and worse. - Please have a seat. - Thank you. I’d like to thank you. You’ve helped he very much. Really. I regained the calmness of my spirit. I used to be a selfish bitch. You wouldn’t believe what I had been doing. I used to put cat shit on my neighbours’, the Turks’, doormat because I couldn’t endure the smell of garlic. It’s no more, though. Now I’m happy. I work as a volunteer in a Kurdish kindergarten. I look after children and work for Kurdistan liberation. My God! That’s impossible. Take a look at the trailer. We also spent our time because we want to help those who are in heed. Responsibility and supporting citizens is essential during the disasters. It’s a closed area. Don’t move. THEFT Faster or we won’t make it before the dikes break. I guess we all remember teachers’ favourite pupils from the school times. Well, I remember different people. Some law-breakers that I disregard more than the others. But, basically, I try to treat everyone the same. But if somebody lies in my throat it pisses me of. Like with that student. Mr. Grabowsky was recording her. You must not record anything without asking. Why, I can record thieves. You’ll go with me. Your name? Jeahette Rieke. I have to see. It was am act of thievery. Shall I inform the security? - Won’t you wait outside? - You do know the consequences. Come on. Didn’t I tell you? It wasn’t that difficult. Take it off. Faster. Was it worth it? I doubt it. Let’s go, Gerd. I’m afraid. I know that this is the only way to deal with our enemies but I’m angry because it made he feel excited. Work should be work and only work. It was her fault. I was excited because of her humiliation. I felt that she was excited too. The girl knew she couldn’t do anything. And simultaneously her nipples became harder. And she wanted to have sex. Oh yeah. You have to meet Kira. She’s so beautiful, beautiful and full of life. I invited her to Berlin. She’s never been to a big city. Maybe you could spend am evening with us? We could see Antonionio’s movie, for example. End of the break. Damn. That’s the third time. LITTERING - Look here, Gerd. - Turn off that camera. MORALITY OFFENCE THE DRUG HABIT ROBBERY Holidays? - No truancy? - No. There’s a child here. You must not do that when the light’s red. - I’m disabled, I’m allowed to. - You also have to respect the regulations. That will give you a lesson. It’s big, isn’t it? Like the dick you were sticking into a 4-year-old, eh? LITTERING THIEVERY PESTERING THIEVERY RECIDIVISM You’re a recidivist, you asshole. I’ve got proof. My breath stinks like canal. I’m not going to change the world today. Today is a free day for everyone. Once Bobby used to greet he, wagging his tail, every time I came back. The time passes so fast. I gave Bobby’s blanket to Gerd. No wonder you never had a job. It’s such a mess in here. He’s been sleeping on my sofa at my place for a few days now. I guess his co-tenant threw him out. Gerd doesn’t want to talk about this and I’m not going to question him about this hatter. Were they at the right place? Strange. Shall we work outside today? The weather’s terrible. You’re starting to have semicircles. He lacks tact. But he’s right. My hair look ugly because of the genes, not me. Nevertheless, his belly is an effect of laziness which lasted for many years. But it’s over how. Another one? He’s peeing into the swimming pool. Excuse he. Get out. You know why. What? Bishop to H7, check. Incredible. - How does he know that? - What? C4 beats H7, check at F7. I’ve never seen anything like that in my entire life. You’re young. See, Gerd? Do the same and all the girls will be yours. His muscles are so tight. Did you learn that? I mean, the massage? No. But I lost so I keep my promise. Shhh. I see that you’re not afraid to do that before the camera. Well, that depends. Would you kiss he, while being recorded? For homey? You wouldn’t afford it. It wasn’t French. You earned your 50. Are you nuts? You’re still shocked, right? I understand. But listen to me, and one day you’ll be grateful. Do you feel cheated? If I were you I would feel too. Me or whoever. So don’t worry. For your information, I did it on purpose. - You wanted to have fun, you asshole. - No, I wanted to teach you something. What you did was the beginning of the end. You agreed to do something for money that you would have never done, if it wasn’t for the bucks. Ever heard of Yin and Yang? ‘‘Way is the destination’’. Did you ever hear that? Shall I explain it? How much are you worth? 100 euro? 1000? 10000? Ferrari? How much, tell me? - You’re piteous. - What? - Punk. - Cunt. You’re so hard but you cry whenever somebody sees your butt. Take a look at Viva or MTV stars. They’d love to fuck all the time. Is that what you desire? It’s not butt where it’s going to end. Don’t be naive. What I’m trying to teach you is that dignity and decency is not for sale. Try to understand it. I know a girl of your age. She kept everything you’re trying to throw away. In 30 years you’re going to wake up in St. Tropez, regretting you’d had such a long life. It’s a waste of time. This is Berlin. This is the Parliament building. Zoo, Brandenburg Gate, Paris Square. Leipzig street in its whole ugliness. And Sprichzig. Like a golden channel. Venice. And those trees... are the green lungs of the city. Mr. Mux. - And the hill. That’s where I live. - Mr. Mux. Yes, house? I’m no house. ‘‘Thou fool. No more shall you be wiser’’. I want to dance. Oh really? With pleasure. Something to dance. Not like that. Let’s go somewhere. But it’s beautiful. I’ve already told you, house. We’re going to see Antonionio’s. With Gerd. I’m not a child. I didn’t come here to watch movies. - But, Mouse. - And don’t call me “mouse”. I’m sorry. Wait. How am I to defend you if I don’t know that you care? - I’m your knight. - Give it a break. Gerd’s going to be sad. RAPE Gerd, faster. So that you can see his face. Yeah? Service. - Not how. - It’s important. Coming. Don’t be ashamed. Come. It’s an older model but it’s digital. Why are you so stiff? You’re going to like it. 50 Euro? Not much for a businessman. I’m not going to let you blackmail he. That’s not the point. Everybody likes it. You’re a nice boy. Very nice. Want to get to know he better? There’s nothing to be afraid of. I’ll get under the coverlet too. Hunting pederasts is very frustrating... morally. Firstly because it’s extremely difficult to change such a person. Once again. You ready? Hunting. Hunting pederasts is very frustrating... morally. Firstly... It’s driving me crazy. What is it? Hey, Mux, it’s Kira again. Why did you hang up the phone? I want us to be friends. I’m having my birthday party in 2 weeks, will you come? There’ll be a few people. I’d really love to see you there. That’s it. Bye. It’s me again. That shop is at the Kurfuerstendamm and Fasanenstrasse streets corner. They’re selling wretched stuff from 8PM. - Cam I have a look? - It’s just tapes. - What tapes? - Various. - Have you ever heard about paragraph 189? - No, what is it about? About penalties for possessing child pornography. What do we have here? ‘‘Juliette at the Pony Ranch’’. We have a deal, right? What questions would you like to ask him? I would... - Why does he do it. - So go on. What did you have those tapes for? It was my first time. Yeah, right, Mr. Strasshah. What else? Do you have a family? A wife. Why do you ask? - I wanted to know whether he had children. - Right. Is it really only wife? No children? - Why? - My wife couldn’t have children. Don’t look at me, it is him who is a pervert. Shall I carry it? Can I go how? Are you joking? You have committed a crime, haven’t you? Should we inform your director about it? You’d lose the job immediately. - Right? - Yes. He doesn’t have his own children so he watches the others getting fucked. - Is that right? - Of course not. Finally. He’s beginning to be scared. He’s slowly understanding he hadn’t been a good boy. - You’re right. - Sure I am. And at the end, please express your opinion about Mr. Grabowsky. Was he well? I’d like to finish the manifest but I can’t concentrate. The medias are full of huge photos of some singer’s ass. I can see it all the fucking time. Big guy, so self-confident, such a panting and dominating anus. He’s staring at me. My manifest is like a toilet paper disappearing in that German’s very ass. Hardcore fucking would prove to be of a good use to him. At least he’d stop smiling so stupidly. God, I’m starting to lose my objectiveness. How was it? I was worrying. I have to check it. No reports in May, I’m sorry. Please greet your wife for me. I’d like to ask you something. Hunting those criminals is not a simple thing. We could catch more of them. We won’t make money on this. But still, see how many people we managed to help last month? More than 500. We’re developing. We’ll have to hire somebody, We’re employing people. That’s why. That’s why we can’t give rises in wages. Do you dream of a fast car, Ibiza and chicks? Go to Wolfsburg, to VW. They might give you a job there. Gerd. You’re right. You know what? I’ll take you somewhere for a supper. You’re on trial. I guess every penny is important for you. That’s true. It wasn’t once that I was bitten black and blue. I admit, it was hard. I didn’t win all the battles. But at least I know how to pretend that everything is fine. Sometimes I’m fed up with all the fight. But I tried to be responsible. 60 years have passed and I didn’t learn a thing Still don’t want to understand. You’re 60? They say it’s going to be simple from now on. But I’m not going to give up. It wasn’t once I wanted to run away. - Your turn. - Seriously. Because I lacked faith. I was afraid of oblivion. I hadn’t been hard back them. But I was slowly becoming as the time passed. Just like wrinkles. I was afraid of oblivion. 60 years have passed and I didn’t learn a thing Still don’t want to understand. You’re 60? They say it’s going to be simple from now on. But I’m not going to give up. Yes, Tutelchen. Life is long. Let’s enjoy it before the end comes. I love you. Yes, Tutelchen. And that’s why I want to tell you right now: Everybody together. 60 years have passed and I didn’t learn a thing Still don’t want to understand. You’re 60? They say it’s going to be simple from now on. But I’m not going to give up. Ladies and gentlemen. It’s time for a song known to all people who can’t sleep, lovers and dreamers. Tutelchen used to be my neighbour when I was studying philosophy and didn’t have a penny. Could you show me that photo? I earned money, working as a conductor. In a hight train from Capri to Neapol. I promised Tutelchen that I would take her there some day. But she feels worse and worse. There is less and less time for the journey to Capri. - Great location. - I’m taking it. Into the archives. Put Those in Call Centre. Full disposal. - Of course. - Welcome to the team. You’re to direct all the information to me or to the office. No violence or ill-treating. I have a mission to fulfil. That’s why I hired you. People are going to hear you, see you. You’re going to be my eyes, my ears. You’re going to tell me who is still weak. And react the way I or Mr. Grabowsky tell you. Call me and I’ll come. I’ll help the others just as I helped you. Berlin is going to be a different city. Take a look at this man. He was unemployed. He was deeper in shit than most of you are. And what did he achieve? Now he’s standing at the other side. lf you do at least half of the things he did. You’ll be successful. Bravo to Mr. Grabowsky. The manifest German society did not manage to find a solution... Look at me when I’m talking to you. You’re on trial. I can still fire you. This is only a warning for now. But if I find you using our tapes for such things you’ll be out. And turn it off. There’s a bomb ticking inside you. You’re alone. You’re afraid. But you’ve got your eyes. And your ears. Soon the criminals will not believe their eyes and ears. Are you fed up with their impunity? Join us. Every reformer heeds informers. Denounce the dearest ones. This ad is some sort of a horrifying shit. Where’s the message? I guess that’s how you call it, right? Nothing. Void. No associations? The word “denounce” can be negatively received in this country. Make a new one. Fucking yuppies. I received a call from my neighbour, informer. Family violence. It’s a real rarity. Where’s that pig?! No! Move away. Stay away from her. I have to see whether she’s still alive. Come, Gerd. Watch out. Can I have one more? I can understand a lot. How it feels to have a family, kids. But how could you do something like that? We’ve got to find some sort of a solution. You’re joking, right? That’s what pisses he off the host. I’m talking to you, trying to help, and you’re trying to mock me?! Can I make a call? My battery’s ran out. It used to be an every-day, quiet street a week ago. A family consisting of four people used to live in this house. Till yesterday. Zehlendorf monster reported himself at the police. Do you regret? Mux, a young radical visionary, poured oil on the flames when he showed further evidence. I can’t see any other solution. Some people who were shown on the tapes have already talked about their problems in various talk-shows. Let’s switch to Berlin where Mux, young idealist, is going to meet with city authorities. Everybody’s talking about us. We took the medias by storm. My views are being discussed. My manifest is quoted. Lately there’s been a discussion about... I’m sorry, but I have to interrupt. There are many who still manage to stay on top and happily spread nothing but bullshit. I’ll poke the truth into their throats. You’re corrupt, broken to the core. The truth is stronger than some quotations. Times when everybody did nothing but complain are gone, but still nobody feels guilty. Passing time will work against you until spirit of the times changes into a bottle gin. We’re going to be back right away. The host important thing in such moments is not to run riot. Mux! - I’m so happy to see you. - Ditto. - Did you catch somebody? - Yes. Let he introduce him to you. - Gerd Grabowsky - Kira. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - I’ve heard a lot about you. - I saw you in the telly. - Really? Then you’re probably going to meet me more often. You have really nice friends. Cheers! Excuse he, have you seen Kira? Not really. Our offices in Cologne, Munich and Hamburg will be connected to us with a direct line. That way it’s going to be faster and more secure. Still, our website has got to be made more user-friendly. A friend I met at the boarding-school works in Duesseldorf as a helicopter pilot. He could help us hunt the criminals. Boss? We’ve got to change our approach. What about other countries? Is it me that has to think about everything? Are there no criminals at all abroad? Have you been to Italy? To Eternal Rome? Dolce Vita. The Italians don’t give a shit about anything. It’s a complete chaos over there. They need me. They heed me to clean that place up. I’m going to Rome. You’ll be responsible for everything in Germany. While I’m away you’ll be the boss here. Sure. What about me? You’ll be my assistant. Like you used to be at the beginning. Goethe’s and Gerd’s trip to Italy - my companions on a way to a new life. “Don’t look back”. I’ll ask some Italian master to draw a portrait of Kira. My notes, my manifest, I’m leaving everything. You, who’ll find them in the future, will read them and understand everything. I want to fly in your thoughts, change your life, become immortal. I’ve decided to finish your trial period earlier. You’ve proven your skills very well. I’d like to put you in charge of much more important assignments right how. As you return to Germany you’re going to take charge of our office in Darmstadt. Your native city. A melon. Yes. Melon. No, melon. Dear Gerd, You’re going to find this tape only if something bad happens to me. What is present for you is future for me that I’m not going to experience. I wish you the very best. There are many people in Germany who think the way we do. That we’ve lost something on the way. And they’re fed up with the wide spread stupidity. If I’m not wrong people like Roland Koch, Dieter Bohlen or Stefan Raab
