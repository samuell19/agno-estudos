I hereby pronounce the divorce, and furthermore, I will be following the recommendations of Child Protection Services. I can see that you're upset, Mr. Houtveen. This court's priority is your children. They've been through a lot, and now they need normality. So she's won? No one's gonna take my children. No one! Can you please stay calm, Mr. Houtveen? Calm? Calm? That's easy for you to say. You're gonna pay for this. - Are you all right? - If I wasn't, I'd be in the wrong job. In a rush? I'm going away for the weekend. Bye, Roy. Hi, Mum. Hey, sweetie. - Bye. - Bye. - Hey! Hey there, boy. - Hi, Dad. Hey, babe. - Work meeting? - Yeah, something like that. Where are all the men? Well, in primary education, the courts, healthcare, men have been pushed out everywhere. I'm the last man standing. So brave. Do you two have any plans for tonight? No. 'Cause I have two tickets for Ajax-AZ. - Yeah! - You're joking. Yes! Awesome! - Hey. - Hey. - Hey! - Hi! Good. - Hey. - How are you? Hello. Okay? Bye. - Have a safe trip. Have fun. - You two have fun. - Bye, Mum. - Have a good trip. - Bye. - See you. Bye. - A pint? - Deadlines. Sorry. How about a pint? No? You sure? Is. Isa. Yeah, thank you. - Here's to us. - Cheers! All right. So you do the first half of the weekend program. I'll do the second half. Tonight, you're going to a lecture by Michael Samuels, that philosopher everyone's talking about. Oh, yeah, and make sure you send a text before and after. Sounds interesting. Tomorrow morning, you can chill out for a while, have lunch at home, do a little social media. In the afternoon, a historical walk to put on Instagram, and then I'll be taking over. A Hugo Claus play at the city theatre. Then a visit to the caf√©, drinks, where we send a few pictures, messages, and after that you're free to do your thing for the rest of the weekend. Oh, yeah. I'll do the Groeningemuseum on Sunday. What about later on? I'm going to a club called Veem in the harbour. Sounds fun! Oh, Bo, um, yeah. Here. I'll hand this over to you. Luuk's totally unaware that I know he installed a GPS tracker on my phone. He can see exactly where I am. I got myself a burner phone. This is my number. I'll pick up my iPhone when I see you at the theatre. Next time it's my turn. I'll make the plans. Mm. Cheers. - Oh, quick photo for the boys at home. - Yeah. Okay. Oh, it's my Uber. - Okay, you have fun, all right? - You too. - There you go, okay? - Thank you. DEACTIVATED Christ! You gave me a fright. Why are you here? I could ask you the same thing. Enjoying a cultural weekend? You know you're not supposed to come. Why? It's my house too. Has the court been notified? Yeah. Your friends in the court. Whatever. You're the one that started litigation. Just relax, will you? I'm leaving. Do you have to be here at all? - I'm just picking something up. - You know you're not allowed to come. "You know you're not allowed to come!" Yara, this stuff isn't yours any more. "Yara, this stuff isn't yours anymore!" You'll get what's yours, Princess! That's not fair. You're the one tampering with the will. Ah! I've made such a mess of my homework again. You're beginning to sound like Mum, you know. But don't worry. I won't bother you any more. You just caught me by surprise. I thought I'd be alone. Yeah, and now you are. Bye. - Hello. - Hi. Welcome back. - The usual room? - Yes, thanks. Thanks a lot. WE'RE READY OVER HERE. ENJOY THE MATCH! XXX SEND TO LUUK LUIJTEN WE'RE JUST IN TIME. GOOD LUCK WITH WORK! Thank you. TO LIE THE TRUTH Research has shown that socially minded people are more likely to lie than those with anti-social tendencies. Sometimes we lie because the reality is simply too hard to bear. Welcome to my lecture on lying. Mm. We love to fool ourselves. Play tricks on our own minds. Let me give you an example. Hey. And remember, the true price that the liar pays is not that no one believes him, but rather that he himself can never believe anyone else. Thank you for listening. That was so cool. Hey. Sorry. I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed that. - Thank you. Thanks. Hmm. - Yeah. I hope I didn't bore you. Far from it. That sounds a little bit like a white lie. Is it really so bad that we fool ourselves? What do you think? I think there's so much pressure on us to be honest these days. Airing our woes, cards on the table. I deal with it on a daily basis, and I don't think we're any very happier for it. So what would you suggest? Much more lying. Want to take a boat ride? Now? Now. Take your clothes off. Your turn. Do it for me. AJAX WAS AMAZING! EVERYTHING OKAY THERE? JUST GOT HOME. KISSES TO YOU BOTH! XXXX Hey, Luuk. This is Bodil speaking. Bodil, um, can I talk to Isabel for a moment? She's in the shower. Can I give her a message? I've broken my ankle. Oh, shit. What... what happened? Yeah, I fell down the stairs. I can't even know how to get to the bathroom. Oh, that's awful. Listen, I booked a train ticket for her. Departure at 10:30. And the train connects with the Thalys in Antwerp. Yeah, I'll certainly pass that on. Sorry, I've gotta deal with this. - Hello. - Hey, it's me. Luuk just called. What does he want? He fell and broke his ankle. Oh, no. Yeah, he's fallen down the stairs, and now he wants you to come home. He's bought you a ticket on the 10:30 train from Bruges and the Thalys in Antwerp. Uh, there's no way I'll make the 10:30. I'll catch a later train. Want me to go with you? No, definitely not. You stay and enjoy yourself. And I still have to get my phone, yeah? I'll drop by and get it on the way. I'll leave it in the hallway by the table. I won't be there, so, uh, the key will be under the mat. - Will be under the mat. No problem. - Good luck. Interesting? Yeah. Hmm. Has something happened? My friend has to leave the weekend early. So you're here with a friend? Hmm. Sorry. None of my business. And so are you going away too, or... Um, well... I've pulled out of the lecture this afternoon. What? It was for personal reason. You can't do that. Some things in life are important. Even so, I just wanna be clear. Hmm, last night was great, really good. But that doesn't mean we're gonna play boyfriend and girlfriend. In fact, if I ever see you on the street, I'll pretend I don't know you. The person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. POLICE Ann Van Passel, CID. This is about Isabel Luijten? - Yeah. - And you came to Ostend together? - Yes. - For business, pleasure? Um, just to get some sea air and a bit of culture. And, uh, is this house a rental? Uh, no, this house was part of my aunt's estate, - Mm-hmm. - But, uh, it's a long story. So you were out of the house when she disappeared? Uh, yeah. And when was the last time you and she were in contact? Uh, she told me she had to go back to the Netherlands. And then she started to pack. - I went swimming. - Alone? Yeah. Hmm. Have you, uh, informed her family yet? - Huh. - Or would you like us to? I'll call her husband. Here. If you could ask him perhaps to get in contact with us. I'm afraid that as this is now a crime scene, I'll have to ask you to stay clear until we give further notice. I'm a judge. I know the procedure. Okay, thank you. - Hey, darling. - Hey. Look, don't freak out, but Isabel's gone. What do you mean "gone"? She's not here. She disappeared. Disappeared? I... floor's covered in blood. I called emergency services and... The police have just left. Jesus! Uh, does, uh, does Luuk know yet? I'm gonna call him, but, uh, I just wanted to let you know. Darling, you... you have to call Luuk. Could you go over there and see him? When Luuk finds out that Isabel's missing, he's gonna lose his mind. But how did it happen? Weren't you with her? No, I went for a swim. And Isa was supposed to go home... What can I do? I can't go anywhere with my foot in a cast. - Milan is on his way to you. - Okay. Hey. Hmm? - Luuk, can you see if... - What? I was thinking, do you know her passwords, so maybe you'd be able to trace her phone. Well, her phone is switched off, so... How long until Milan gets here? Can he take me there? Uh, yeah. Of course. - Let's not assume the worst. - Call me soon as you hear anything. I'm looking for a good friend of mine. She stayed here last night. Isabel Luijten. Room 113. I'm afraid we can't share guests' private information. Well, can I go up and check her room in case she left a note? Room 113 has already been cleaned. If the housekeepers had found anything, they would have told me. - Where can I find the manager? - He's inside. Can I ask you something? The person you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please try again later or leave a message. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. I'm so glad you made it. Why didn't she just take that train? And she told you nothing? We've been through all this. Come on. - Ann Van Passel. - Milan Saber. - Ann Van Passel. Bodil. - Hi. I'm Sophie Verschueren. Sorry to inform you the blood samples taken in the hallway are consistent with the blood type of Isabel Luijten. Of course, we've sent out an alert with immediate effect. We're searching everywhere. - I'm sorry. - Hey. Come on. Come on, let's get you inside. Come on. There some place we can have a talk? We have a few more questions for you. The GPS data from the nearest phone mast show that, uh, you were both here in the house at the time Isabel disappeared. At two minutes past 12, her phone was switched off at this location. At that time, your phone was in the house as well. Yeah, like I told you, I'd gone out swimming. - Yeah. - And I didn't take my phone with me. And might anyone confirm that? Can I, uh, tell you something off the record? You're very welcome to. Of course, there's no way I can guarantee that it will stay off the record. At the time, I was with Michael Samuels. Samuels? I'm friendly with him. We were together on the beach. I went swimming. Then he left, and I came back home. And this Mr. Samuels can confirm this? How's Luuk? I gave him something to calm down. You were talking to them for a long time. What did they ask you? Can't I just get a drink? Hey, hey, come here. You know, on Friday night, Isabel wasn't here. Where was she? In a room at the Thermae Hotel. What, so you're saying, uh... So... so Isabel didn't go with you to that lecture? No. But the photo you sent me, that message. I'm so sorry. Hello. Mrs. Backer. Yeah, I've been trying to call Mr. Luijten, but unfortunately, he's not picking up. - Why? What's happened? - Mrs. Luijten's phone has been found. The device was dropped off this morning. When we examined the phone, we found there was some particularly disturbing material on it. I... I ought to warn you, you'll probably find this photo quite distressing. Is this your wife, Luuk? Yeah. We believe that she was killed with a garotte. Yes, an iron wire. In this case, presumably a piano string, with a handle on each end to apply force. Cheap, silent and extremely effective. Her carotid artery was most likely severed, which is why there was so much blood. As a judge, I'm sure you're aware that this changes the nature of the investigation. An anonymous hitman has informed the client Zadkin that the mission is accomplished. The message was sent to Zadkin 1337, an address on AmazonBay. This is on the dark web. The information on the dark web is anonymous, so it's impossible to trace the sender. Does the name Zadkin mean anything to you? Uh, not to me, no. Can you think of a possible motive? Did she have any problems? A jealous lover, for example? No. - There you go. - Thank you. NIGHT WATCHMAN - How's Luuk? - Not good. He needs to go back to the Netherlands and talk to a counsellor. What's the latest from the police? Anything new? They said the message was sent to someone called Zadkin, apparently. They're trying to find out who that is. And did you tell them what really happened? Jesus, Bo. This is a murder now. You know Isabel was somewhere else that night. With someone else. And you're acting like it doesn't matter. - It felt like a betrayal. - A betrayal? Of you or Isabel? You have to tell the police. And take a lawyer with you this time. Luuk. I'm afraid there's no easy way to tell you. Isabel wasn't here on Friday night. What? She was at the Thermae Hotel, as it happened. What do you mean? She sent me a picture on Friday night. It's from this living room. By the hearth. When I called you, she was in the shower. A few hours later she was... But why would you say something like that? I installed a tracker on her phone. I knew precisely where she was. Now she's been declared dead, you should leave everything to us. It's always slightly complicated when the body isn't found, but, yeah. The facts speak for themselves. I have a bit of a problem, 'cause my story doesn't add up. Hmm. And they haven't put it all together yet. I told the police that... that Isabel and I were together, but, uh, really, we hadn't seen each other since Friday at the station. Why wouldn't you tell that to the authorities? I was trying, I suppose, to spare her husband. And I was still hoping she'd come home. Then we can go to the police and clear this up. Two days ago, you said this. Yesterday, you said that. And now you're saying something else. Now you're telling me you didn't see each other the whole weekend. I hope you realise that we're no longer talking about a missing person, but a murder. It certainly casts your previous false statements in a new light. Luuk Luijten showed me the messages from his wife that she sent to his phone. Those pictures show that you went to a lecture together, drank some wine with each other at the beach house. I'd taken Isabel's phone with me. Those photos and messages were from me. I sent them to Luuk. I'm sorry. I was trying to salvage my friend's reputation, her name. From where I'm standing, you're the one whose reputation is in question. Well, according to Mr. Samuels, he didn't see you Saturday. What? He says he doesn't know you. I advise my client to invoke her right to remain silent. Right after our initial interrogation, you went straight to the Thermae Hotel. Were you trying to cover your tracks? - My client invokes her right... - Yeah, yeah, I know. I hope you're gonna make it clear to Mrs. Backer that withholding information may be a criminal offence. Until the investigation is over, your client is not allowed to leave Belgium. A garrote can be made out of different materials... ...like a cable, wire and a piano string. Mum. I'm sorry, sweetie. I, um, I know I haven't called you in a while, but... Something terrible has happened to Isabel. - She's, uh... - Grandpa already told me. Have the police found her yet? No, not yet. But there's nothing to worry about, sweetheart. Mummy and Daddy will be home soon. Having fun with Grandma and Grandpa? Mm-hmm. Good. But my school essay is still on Dad's computer. Wait a minute. Uh, well, Luuk, I couldn't care less. Luuk, listen. No, you don't get it. You just don't! - Mum. - Yeah. Yeah, I'll let him know. - Okay. - Hmm. - Bye. - Bye! How can you be so blind? Can't you see? Do you know what I think? You're the one who's cheating, Bodil. Yeah. Isabel did everything for you. Did it take a lot of effort to stop her? I have no idea what you're talking about. Well, you never told her she would be better off without me? I was about to start looking outside. Ah. Well, I was just looking in here. You act like there's nothing going on. - You need to get a night's sleep. - No, no. My eyes are wide open. Don't worry. He's not himself. Where were you? I couldn't sleep. What did he say to you? He says it's my fault. Luuk's in the middle of the denial phase. Give him some time. It's bound to sink in sooner or later. And then? He's gonna be angry. Hey, he'll get through this. Let's make sure we're there for him. Hey. Why did you tell the police that you don't know me? I thought that's what you wanted. - What? - You were pretty clear about that. Actually, I was kind of offended by it. Have I got you in trouble? That's awful. If I can help at all. But you'll call the police? I'll withdraw my statement. Sorry. - Mrs. Backer? - Hi. The police have a camera recording of your friend at the hotel. They're asking if you can come and take a look. Shall I see you there? - No. - Yeah. I'll be waiting at the front door. If you need to find me... We have several pieces of footage of Isabel Luijten, and these were captured late on Friday night, shortly after four in the morning. - Yeah, can you fast-forward a bit? - Yeah. Do you know this woman? That's my sister. Yara. - Now that is interesting. - The same surname as you? And what was her relationship to Isabel? My client invokes her right to remain silent. Okay, okay. Isabel was with Yara last Friday. Your sister? She was here on Friday when we arrived. You never mentioned that. Yeah, I didn't think it was important. Van Passel showed me the security footage from the Thermae Hotel of Isabel and Yara together. It's quite, um, intimate. Isabel and Yara. How could she do that? I don't get it. What don't you get? The lying? Or the cheating? LAWYER Hi. Mrs. Backer, your sister was arrested last night. She's being detained for further questioning. - I'll keep you updated. - Okay. Why don't you open the balcony door for a while? Yeah. All right. Are you okay? - Listen, Luuk, let's talk about... - I know exactly what you think of me. You turned Isabel against me. That's not true. I was a burden for her career. Why would she need a depressed writer? - I never said that. - Oh, please! You know... Isabel was... Isabel is everything to me. I just wanted to keep her close to me. At times, she was stifled by that. Ah, is that your verdict? I just wanted Isabel to be her old self again. The way she was when we met. The Isabel that you knew in the early days, she felt free, and... all she really needed was space to breathe, Luuk. But isn't that what you need? Leave me alone. Your wife's fucking someone else, and you're sticking your head in the sand. It's pathetic. He's telling the truth. I wanted her to break up with him. Doesn't matter any more. What's wrong? You've never done that before. How's the leg doing? It's taking a while to heal, but I'll get there. Jesus! I've been looking for you. They've taken my passport, so I can't go anywhere. If they find out you've been here, I'm gonna be in a lot of trouble. Yeah, 'cause that's all you're interested in. - Right? - I never said that. They saw you with Isabel on Friday. Then she went missing. How... how can I... - How can I be certain that... - You think I did something to her? We were gonna run away. And be together. Where? Where to? It doesn't matter any more. Didn't expect that from your friend, did you? - She never told me anything. - And why's that, do you think? I think it's because you can't bear it when things don't go the way you want them to. Every time she said she was going to tell you, and every time she came back to me and said it wasn't quite the right moment. Because people don't like arguing with you. - You're a tyrant. - Every time? Every time. Yeah, were together for quite a while. And so, as I was saying, my passport's gone. I thought maybe you could check with one of your colleagues to see if I'm on the investigation register. - That would be an abuse of my position. - Mm-hmm. Do you know what the real difference is between you and me? You lie better. Wait. I'll help you. I would appreciate it if this stayed between us. Exactly. And? You're listed. Okay. Well... thank you. Will you keep in touch? Okay, yeah. Hmm, I'll see you soon. For you. You can take someone out with that temporarily. - What? - It's a taser. Why? Well, your house, your weekend. Isabel wasn't even supposed to be here. What, you hadn't thought of that? That's funny. You're so self obsessed, but you never thought that just maybe this was all about you. Look after yourself. - Hey, little dragon. - Hey, Mum, my school essay? Oh, shit. I completely forgot. But I need it tomorrow. - So it's been put on dad's computer? - Yes. - I'll go find it now. - Okay. Bye. Ciao. Milan! Milan. Daddy's busy, darling. Yeah, but, Mum, I have to hand it in tomorrow. Let me see if I can do it. Um, let's see. Oh, shit, I don't know his password. 0609197. What? It's a date. September 6, 1972. Ajax's first World Cup. Yep, worked. - And it's in "documents"? - Yeah. Have you found it? Oh, wait, please, uh... Mum? Ben, I'll call you back in a minute. You called me. Would you like something to eat? I'll heat something up. LIVING ROOM - BEDROOM Bodil? Are you okay? Must have been something I ate. You hardly ate at all. Let me get you a sedative. I don't want one. You should see yourself. Have a bath. Try and relax. Stop! Stop! Hope you'll be able to help me. Mrs. Backer. I was the one supposed to be murdered. They killed the wrong person. I found a recording taken by my husband. Can we see this recording? I, uh, found this by accident. What? Fuck. I swear... it was there. Sophie, could you get us some water, please? Sure. And now it's disappeared? Accidentally deleted maybe? I don't know what's happened here. You've got to believe me. My husband has cameras in the living room, in the kitchen and all of the bedrooms. All of it, he filmed. Mrs. Backer, we're extremely busy at the moment. We don't have time for this. Arrest me then. You think I did it? So lock me up. I have no intention of locking you up. - This place isn't a hotel. - Didn't you hear what I said? Put me under arrest. Mrs. Backer, your sexual morality may not be the same as mine, and it's not my place to pass judgment on it, but you've already lied so much about everything, that I'm really not sure what's the truth any more. Now if you'll excuse us, we have work to do. Sophie, could you see Mrs. Backer to the door, please? Of course. Taxi! Hey, first floor. Door on the right. - Hi. - Hi. What is it? Here. Let me take your coat. Come in. I'm so glad you came tonight. Really. I'll get you a drink. You play piano? Sometimes, yeah. Tea? Come. How did you work it out? I don't mind the fact that you're seeing someone once in a while. Really. I get it. But don't run away from me. You're in love with him? What? No. Fine then. That's something, at least. Want a drink? Doctor's orders. When was the last time you slept? I mean, really slept. Lack of sleep can really screw you up. You saw what it did to Luuk. You just need a good rest. That's all. Luuk. Oh, fuck! Luuk! - Luuk! Luuk! - Luuk! Quick, turn him on his side. Luuk, hey! - Fuck, Luuk. What are you doing? - Calling an ambulance, Milan. No. Hey! If we'd called an ambulance, they'd have put him in a hospital for observation. - And we'd be stuck here for another week. - That's bullshit. I'm a fucking doctor, Bodil, all right? He's going to be fine. How did he get those pills? Did you give it to him? I am so sick of this. What the fuck are you doing? You must have had quite a shock when you heard I was still alive. What do you mean? What were you going to say to our son? "Your mother was cheating on me, so I had her murdered"? You could have just left me when you saw the recording. It's not about that. I don't mind if you do it with someone else. Oh, yeah? It turns me on. All I ever did was watch. Is that all? Tell me. So who else have you all been spying on? No one. I'm not interested in other women. I'm interested in you, Bodil. I'm interested in you. It's about watching you while you're... When you're turned on, it excites me. Oh. Now can you untie me, please? Please, Bodil, let me go. Cut these ties! I'll leave that to the police. I'm calling an ambulance for Luuk. No, no, don't. We can be home by tomorrow. Bodil. Bodil, don't do this. Please, just let me go. Bo! Bodil, where are you going? Ward Zadkin lives in a weird universe. Illusion and reality merge into an amalgam when he gets involved in a web of intrigue. You should have just let those pills do their job. You should have been here. If Isabel had taken that train, everything would have been fine. With you gone, our life would have been just like before. Luuk... you don't really think that. Yeah. Isabel and I were soulmates. She knew that too. Now I have to live without her. Look, I know everything seems dark right now. Luuk. - You sneaky bitch. - Luuk. Luuk! It's time for this judge to be punished. Luuk! Luuk. Hey. Luuk, please untie me. We can fix this. It's going to be okay. RESCUE SERVICE We've carried out a complete search of the files on his computer. And all of this means we can map out the whole course of events in detail. You were right. You were the target. And as for Zadkin, it turns out that it's the name of the main character in his novel Night Watchman. - Hmm. - Did that not occur to you? I've never read it. Me neither. Anyway, in light of all this, what happened this evening can be considered legitimate self-defence. We don't see any reason why we should investigate you any further. What about the hitman? Have you tracked him down? We suspect that he's already left the country. But we're looking into it. We tried to get in touch with your sister, but no luck so far. Perhaps you could return her passport? Of course. - Thank you. - Thanks. What now? - So is it nice to see Daddy again? - Yep. I'm just finishing up some paperwork here, but I'm coming home soon. KISS, ISA - Hello. - Is Yara there? Ah, you just missed her. Any idea where she went? She's going to the private airport in Ostend. Hey. I'm so sorry. - How could you? - I'm sorry. Look, I... I just couldn't see any other way out of this. How could you lie to me? Look who's talking. But... What the fuck. Hold on a minute. So, but how did... How? Whatever Luuk did, I could do too. I saw a huge withdrawal on one of his bank accounts. Then I came across a link to the dark web in one of his secret folders, and that's where I saw Luuk's assignment. That's where I saw Luuk's assignment to have you killed. So I used the same link to contact the hitman. Long story short, I told him I would pay him double if he agreed to do nothing at all. You have to understand, this was my only chance to get rid of Luuk. We faked the murder. We took a photo and made sure it got to the police. Then I sent you a copy of Luuk's book to let you know that he was Zadkin. So, when Luuk still hadn't been arrested, Yara went to the house to warn you. But Yara could have just told me the truth. You could have just told me what was... Why didn't you tell me what the two of you were planning? You're a judge. You never would have agreed to it. Or would you? Me, I'd say you were bloody lucky you weren't involved. No? Look, Bo, I knew your life was in danger because of me. I thought it would be better for everyone if I disappeared. You see? It's just things didn't go the way that we planned. Sorry. Everything's ready. Time to board the plane, please. I'm so glad I got to see you. I'm sorry, so sorry. Yara. Hmm. Take care of her, won't you? - Yeah. - Okay, I'll let you know where we end up. Yeah, make sure you call before you visit. Hi.
