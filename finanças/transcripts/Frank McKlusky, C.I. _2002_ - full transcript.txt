[ ROCK MUSIC PLAYS ] Man: THE YEAR WAS 1979. MY DAD WAS AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME. HE WAS A THRILL SEEKER, A DAREDEVIL, A MAN WHO, FOR 11 YEARS, WOULD KEEP THE FAMILY NAME SYNONYMOUS WITH SOME OF THE GREATEST STUNTS EVER ATTEMPTED. [ CROWD CHEERING ] MY DAD...WAS NOT THAT GUY. NOPE. WE WERE THE McKLUSKYS. MY DAD WAS THE GRANDSON OF ALBERT McKLUSKY, ONE OF THE GREAT PIONEERS OF -- WELL, STUFF LIKE THIS... AND THIS. OH, AND HERE'S MY FAVORITE. OOH! BAM! ALL THIS CULMINATED WITH MY DAD. HE WAS THE BEST OF THE BUNCH. YEP, WHEN IT CAME TO PERFORMING AT HALF-EMPTY FLEA MARKETS, MY FATHER HAD NO PEER. THERE'S ME, MY MOM, AND MY BABY BROTHER, DARRYL. [ HORN HONKING TUNE ] AND THAT GUY TEETERING DANGEROUSLY ON THE ROOF OF THE VAN... HE ALSO HAPPENED TO BE MY DAD. Announcer: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME A MAN THAT EVEL KNIEVEL HIMSELF ONCE CALLED A GODDAMNED CRAZY BASTARD... MADMAN McKLUSKY! WHOOOOAA! [ THUD ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HA HA! HA HA. [ FEEDBACK ] THAT WAS A STUNT! DONE TOTALLY ON PURPOSE! HONEY, WE HAVE TO TALK. HUH? LITTLE FRANK IS TOTALLY OBSESSED. ALL HE DOES IS TALK ABOUT YOU AND YOUR ACCIDENTS.

EXCEPT FOR GRANDPA ELMO McKLUSKY -- BLEW HIS EYEBALLS OUT SWALLOWING DYNAMITE AT A CARNIVAL. MAD, I THINK, UH, MAYBE WE SHOULD SCRAP THE JUMP. WHAT? YOU GIVE ME ONE GOOD GODDAMNED REASON WHY. THE BOYS AND I -- WE ASSEMBLED THE MOTORCYCLE AT -- AT LUNCHTIME, AND WE'VE BEEN DRUNK SINCE BREAKFAST. WE KIND OF RAN OUT OF GASOLINE, SO WE FILLED THE TANK WITH LIGHTER FLUID. JUST GIVE ME THE DAMN ODDS. [ SIGHS ] [ CLICKING ] THERE'S A 99.999% PROBABILITY YOU'RE GONNA EXPLODE. [ GASPS ] GIVE OR TAKE A BEER. [ BURPS ] LITTLE FRANK, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. THERE'S A COUPLE OF REASONS WHY I NEVER LIVE MY LIFE BY THE ODDS. NUMBER ONE, YOU CAN'T EVER ACHIEVE ANYTHING UNLESS YOU TAKE A RISK. AND "B," I AIN'T SO SMART WITH MATH. Madman: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, Crowd chanting: JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! ARE YOU READY FOR THE MADMAN TO...LAUGH AT SAFETY? HA HA! Chanting: JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! [ MOTORCYCLE REVS ] JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! JUMP! JUMP!

IT'S YOUR HUSBAND. HE'S IN AN UNCONSCIOUS COMA-TYPE DEAL, BUT WITH SOME OF OUR RADICAL, CUTTING-EDGE TREATMENTS AND, UH, A LITTLE HELP FROM THE MAN UPSTAIRS, I THINK WE CAN REVIVE HIM. THAT IS IF YOUR INSURANCE WERE ANY DAMN GOOD. I SEE IT EVERY WEEK -- SMALL INSURANCE COMPANY GETS HIT WITH SOME PHONY, MISGUIDED CLAIM. THEY DON'T HAVE THE MEANS TO FIGHT, SO THEY FOLD.

WE REPRESENT THE CROWD THAT WITNESSED YOUR HUSBAND'S EXPLOSION TODAY. AND WELL, WE'VE FILED A RATHER [LAUGHS] NASTY CLASS-ACTION SUIT AGAINST YOU. BUT FOR WHAT? YOU NEVER HEARD OF 'MOTIONAL STRESS AND SHIT? DO YOU REALIZE MY HUSBAND IS NOT RECEIVING PROPER MEDICAL TREATMENT BECAUSE OF YOUR FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT? MOVING ON... SINCE MADMAN TECHNICALLY WAS NEVER AIRBORNE, WE'RE ALSO SUING YOU FOR FALSE ADVERTISING. MM-HMM. UH-HUH. THAT'S RIGHT. BROTHERS DON'T PLAY. WE WANT THE MON-EY. YEAH.

THE MOST RECENT ONE -- ALL THE WAY OUT IN PENNSYLVANIA. BUT MY MAIN FOCUS WAS TO BRING DOWN THE ROSENGOLDS. HAVE A NICE DAY, SON. OKAY. OH, AND, FRANKIE, REMEMBER, BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY.
