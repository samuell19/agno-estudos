[instrumental music] [wind howling] [bird squawking] [instrumental music] [Albans] Morning, Anne. How are you? [Anne] Not bad. Um, I just got a job. I got hired to nanny this summer, for Natalia's kids. [Albans] Your thesis supervisor? [Anne] Yeah. [Albans] Do you think that's wise? [Anne] Natalia won't be there. She's in Europe, I think. [Albans] Are you worried about being alone with just the kids? [Anne] Well, Natalia's husband will be coming and going, so I won't be completely alone. I don't know him very well, but he seems nice. [Albans] And how are your symptoms? Any difficulty concentrating? Anything like that? Um, no. I'm fine, yeah. I'm trying to get out more. Trying to do more. [Anne] Really just be good to get back to composing. Maybe being in Natalia's space, being around her family might help me, uh, focus again. [Albans] Anymore blackouts? Uh, no. Uh, not since the accident. - [tires screeching] - [screams] You hesitated. Well, I, um, I may have been sleepwalking. That can happen with Zolpidem. We can try something different. No, it's fine. Um, it's not that bad. [Albans] Okay. Well, you know, sleepwalking can be dangerous. [Anne] You know what, uh, I don't know if it actually happened, I might have just dreamed it up or something. [instrumental music] All right. [music continues] [boat engine revving] Anne, can you grab that line? Uh... Yeah, sure. I thought you said you've been around boats. No, I said I was in a canoe at a Y day camp. - Oh. - [Emily] I'll do it. Oh, I can take that. Nobody's allowed up there but Natalia. When is she expected back? We don't know. [dramatic music] [Anne gasps] Who's this? Lucy. Does she live here? He. It's short for Lucifer. Oh. You can feed him, too, sometime, if you want. Okay. Thanks. [birds chirping] [dramatic music] [music continues] There's a bathroom across from your room. Oh. Um, I'm sorry. I just needed a Tylenol. Thought you were doing better. Uh, yeah, I just have a headache. [Dominic] Well, hope you're okay. Um... I sent Natalia an email. A few emails, actually. It's just she doesn't know that I'm here, so... I thought you withdrew from the program. Yeah, but temporarily. How did you know that? [Dominic] Brigitte from faculty admin. That's why she recommended you help us out. I, I had to take a pause 'cause I broke my arm. But, uh, I'm better now. - I'm committed to going back... - [Emily screaming] [Emily] Leon! Leon, stop! - I'm telling! - It's just a puzzle, idiot. [Emily] Dad, Leon's annoying me! How's your head now, hm? [Emily] Dad! It doesn't say how much time to spend on each subject. [scoffs] I vote zero. Hate to break it to you, buddy, but this is not a democracy. Shouldn't they have some say, though? - You're the teacher. - She's a babysitter. Don't be rude. [sighs] It's summer. None of my friends have to do this shit. - They take drugs. - Who asked you? Look, I need to finish my book in peace, you need to finish the tenth grade. That's all there is to it. Okay? [Leon sighs] [Dominic] Cool it with the attitude, Leon. [door slams] [Dominic sighs] Sorry about that in there. Leon has been a handful since his mum took off. Oh, that's okay. I'm sure I'll win him over eventually. [sighs] Might be a long summer, Anne. You should feel free to relax, you know, and have your boyfriend up, if you want. - Uh, no boyfriend. - Hm. There's no time for that really. You sound like Natalia. Except for the no-boyfriend part. Uh, so you haven't heard from her either? No, Anne. She walked out on us six months ago. Oh. I'm sorry. Yeah, well... It's been a long day. I'm headin' in. [boat engine revving] If you run out of anything, call the marina, okay? I'll try to be back next weekend. [Emily] Bye, dad! [Dominic] Take care. - [gunfire on video game] - [knocking on door] [Anne] Leon? Hey. What you workin' on? Homework. Um, what do you want for dinner? Whatever. Hm. You look happy in this photo. Put that back. Please. When's the last time you heard from your mum? She sent me some shit for Christmas. Do you mind? That's really good. Thanks. I think I like yours better, though. You should be more confident in yourself. My mum used to say that. Is your mom nice? She was nice, yeah. [Emily] Did she die? Yeah, when I was 15. - That's sad. - It's okay. Music helps. How about your mom? Is she nice? [Emily] Natalia's very talented. - At the piano? - Mm-hmm. That's why she left us to go to Europe so she could perform, 'cause that's the only place where people appreciate serious music. [sighs] [wind howling] [dramatic music] [sighs] [instrumental music] [Anne] Five, four, three... two... one! [chuckles] Emily? [bird squawking] Emily? [dramatic music] - [gasps] - [Emily chuckles] [Anne] Hah. [Laura] Hi there! - Hi. - Hey. Uh, Chris and I are here to pick up Leon. Oh. Well, was I supposed to know about this? Dominic didn't tell you? - No. - Typical. Hi, I'm Laura, this is Chris. We just live on shore. The kids stay with us all the time. Oh, cool. I'm Anne. I've seen you before. Have you? This is my first time here. [Leon sighs] - Hey. Hi. - [Leon chuckles] [Anne] What about the history essay you were doing, huh? - What about it? - Is this a bad time? [Leon] It's fine! [Anne] It's okay. He'll finish it tonight. Okay, I'll have him back by 5:00. See you later. - Bye. - [Laura] Let's go. [footsteps approaching] - [piano music] - [sighs] [dramatic music] [birds chirping] [dramatic music] [music continues] [door opens] [music continues] [Laura] Bye, Leon. See you soon, okay? [Leon] See you later. Leon, do you know where your mom mailed those Christmas presents from? No. Natalia got me a paint easel. Dad sent them, you idiot, so we wouldn't be upset. Hey, don't talk like that. It's not nice. You can't call her names. So what did you and Chris do today? Mom doesn't let people in the piano loft without permission. [piano music] [dramatic music] [music continues] [Leon] Anne? Were you playing the piano? No. Don't lie to me. I heard you. It wasn't me. If you're doing this to scare me, Leon... It wasn't me! Go back to bed. Go back to bed. [breathing heavily] [Laura] We moved to the lake full-time when Chris went to high school. Plus, Barney, he only has to go to the office a few times a week, so, perks of tenure. [chuckles] Hey, so have you read Dominic's book? - Literary Orgasms? - Yeah. No. Actually, that was a huge success for him. Yeah. There was a moment there when he was almost as big a star as Natalia. Hm. What happened? Why wasn't he? Oh, I don't know. Just had a hard time following up, I guess. And with Natalia always looming over his shoulder... that must've made things harder. Hm. So what's your story? Why did you leave your life to come up here? [Anne] Hm. Well, it's a good place to work on my music. - Hm. Just like Natalia. - Yeah. Well, Natalia is my supervisor. But her focus is on performance, and mine is composition, so... [Laura] She really is a talent. - Hm. - Mm. Are the kids okay? Yeah. I mean... they miss their mom. Look, I don't like gossip, but Natalia and I, we talked, for sure. She was due for a sabbatical, so when this visiting-professor guy who she was seeing, um, when he went home to Prague, she went with him. Why would she just leave her kids here? Well, technically, it's, it's kid. Leon's from, uh, Natalia's first marriage. - Emily's from Dominic's. - Hm. Anyway. I'm talking too much. [dramatic music] [instrumental music] [Emily gasps, screaming] Emily? [Emily screaming] Emily? What's wrong? - Emily? - [Emily breathing heavily] Sweetie, calm down, look at me now. [Emily] He killed Lucy! [Anne] Who did? [Emily] Leon! For no reason. Well, maybe it's not Lucy. - You think so? - Yeah. Sure, there are a lot of other bunnies around here. How about a hot chocolate? - He's the reason she left. - What? [Emily] He's the reason why Natalia left. She hates him. And so do I. [flies buzzing] [Anne] Leon? Leon! [intense music] [grunts] What the freak! You nearly killed me with that thing. Yeah, well, watch where you're going. Leon, Emily found the rabbit. You can't just hit me, psycho. Get back to the house. Screw you. [yells] Get back to the house! [sighs] [eerie music] [boat engine revving] Thanks for coming. Where is he? [Dominic] Why would you kill your sister's pet? - It was just some rabbit. - [Dominic] Okay. Why would you kill some rabbit? Leon? - It was an accident! Really! - Really? Oh, come on, man! I was just aiming at things with my crossbow when it slipped. Yeah, then you chose to leave it where your sister could find it. - Were you mad at her? - Were you mad at me? Why would I be mad at you? Well, you clearly don't want me here. That's why you were scaring me with the piano. - Leon doesn't play piano. - No, duh. I thought Leon was playing a trick on me. I'm telling you, she's psycho. [Dominic] Leon! - [Leon] Where's she even from? - Anne was your mother's student. Right. So she plays the piano. Dominic, this is ridiculous. He nearly killed me! [sighs] Leon, go get me the crossbow. - Now, please! - [sighs] I shouldn't have lost my temper with him. [Dominic sighs] Don't tell me you're actually reading that. - It's a little over my head. - [laughs] Right. So now there's a ghost in the boathouse? [laughs] [piano music] [sighs] That's what I heard the other night. Natalia was working on that piece. It was part of her next album. - It was my thesis project. - [Dominic] Really? - Mm-hmm. - I didn't know that. [Anne] Took two years to write. You know, I was so flattered when she told me she wanted to record it. Um... But then she started changing it around and making improvements. That sounds about right. I'm trying to work on a new piece right now. It's... It's total shit. [Dominic] Well, that's what she wants you to feel. See, Natalia doesn't really... I don't know, she doesn't really create a lot of room for other people, you know? She's... How can you compete with her? She's not just a professor, she's a performer. [Anne] A really great one. You know what, I think she doesn't even realize how small she makes us feel. Well, she's, she's gone. For now, at least. You should get her out of your head. [Dominic] Can we, uh, go and sit outside, maybe? I just never really liked it up here. - Sure. - [Dominic] Great. How can you stomach it? - What? - Being here. If she treated you so badly. Well, when Natalia left, I, uh, everything I was working on stopped. Had a grant that was tied to her being my supervisor. - And it got suspended. - Oh... So, that's the reason you took the job, huh? Grant money? Well, it wasn't just the grant money. No, she gave me a studio to work in. I... An apartment... a budget... And then she took your work? Huh. She didn't even need it. It was all I had. But even with all of that, I kind of feel like I'm out of my depth with the kids. Yeah. Yeah, they're both hurting. I... I don't know how to make it better, I... I don't know what to do. Hey. Can you just stay? - But why can't you stay? - Sorry, kiddo. I only have an hour to get into town. - For what? - Honey, for some meetings. That's why, that's why Anne's here, right? - She's great. - Mm-hmm. See you Friday. Oh, I think I might invite Barney and Laura over this weekend. Maybe Brigitte from faculty as well. Sure. See you, kiddo. [sighs] [bird chirping] [dramatic music] [door opens] Anne? [intense music] [piano music] [woman] Anne. [music continues] [Natalia on recorder] You're losing it, Anne. You're not fooling anyone. [woman] Anne. Anne. Anne? [dramatic music] [Dominic] Hey. You look nice. Oh, thanks. Are, uh, Laura and Barney bringing Chris over? Ah, Leon can entertain himself. It's the adults' night for some fun, right? Hm. Laura seemed worried. - [Dominic] About? - The kids. Ah. Yeah, watch out. Laura is fun, but she's a meddler. - [door opens] - [Laura] Hello, stranger. [Dominic] Hey! Hey. Come on in. The hermit emerges from his lair. So how goes the summer anyway? [chuckles] Hm. Slowly. - Yeah, slowly, hm. - [Barney] Well, you look good. - Thanks. Hm. - [Barney] Trim. [Barney] Anxiety's really workin' out for you. [both laughing] Ah, one good thing to come out of all this, I guess. Oh, yeah. Just one good thing, nothing else? - It's not like that. No. - [Barney] Yeah? Good. Because you know you shouldn't be jumping into anything else. - I'm not. - Good. [laughter] [indistinct chatter] [Barney] What is wrong with you? [Dominic] Nothing. [Barney] You-you driving a boat like that? [Dominic laughing] [indistinct chatter] [Barney] Yeah, I like to see that. - [intense music] - Seriously, look. If you need anything, anything at all... [glasses clinking] [Brigitte] You can have some, right? I mean, with the accident and all. Oh, yeah, yeah. A glass or two is fine. - Wow. - [both chuckling] - Thank you. Cheers. - Cheers. Um, so you know Dominic from before? - Before Natalia? Yes. - Yes. I introduced them. So then did you know Dominic's first wife? Yes. Well, then, uh, why did they split up? [Brigitte] Um, well, they didn't. Jemma died in a house fire. She was lovely. A doctor. Dominic likes his ambitious women, mm. [Anne] He doesn't talk about her. Well, it's a pretty sad memory. I think Dom will tell the kids when they're older. Anyway, tonight we're having fun. How's the new book coming along? - Mm, nearly done. - Great. - Really? - Well, don't sound so surprised. Well, it has been some time. I mean, you should really stop by the faculty club more often. There's plenty of people there who'd be interested in knowing what you're workin' on. Mm, it doesn't hurt to be a little bit political, either. Well, I'll take that under advisement. But admittedly, the kids have been taking my focus. Before, um, Anne, I mean. And how has that been working out? Well, um, Leon nearly killed me a couple of days ago. - What? - Well, it wasn't on purpose. He had just made this booby-trap thing. Well, needless to say, Leon is no longer in possession of said booby trap. - [Laura] Well, that's a start. - Mm-hmm. [Barney] Speaking of boys being stupid... Oh! Oh, my God, Barney, don't. - He's obsessed! Yes! - I am not obsessed. [Barney] I'm just annoyed, that's all! Anyway, so I have this student, and he's one of these kids who's never worked for anything... Something you would know anything about? And he hands in his story for my short fiction class, and I'm reading it, and as I'm readin' it, I realize this is goddamn Joyce! Barney wrote his dissertation on Ulysses... Yeah, I mean, if you're gonna rip someone off, you pick somebody obscure, right? Does anybody really read Joyce anymore, Barney? Really? - I read Joyce. - [Barney] Thank you, Brigitte. Anyway, so I called this kid in and I confront him, and he's all like, "Oh, professor, I didn't know, I didn't know," and I'm like, "Jesus Christ, man, you've been here for four years! I mean, how long have you been pulling this shit for?" You're a real joy, you know that? Anyway, so I go through all the proper channels, I call a tribunal, at the end of it all, doesn't it turn out that his parents are major donors, and can't I just look the other way. I mean, for fuck's sake! How the hell is anybody supposed to grow up and have an original thought anymore? But, Barney, okay, this is where we disagree. I mean, really, what is an original thought and who owns it? There's nothing new under the sun. All the greats knew that. Joyce knew that. It's called standing on the shoulders of giants. You, Dominic, do you steal for your books? - It's inspiration! - Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry. You, Dominic, are you inspired to steal to benefit your work? [Dominic] No. No. [Barney] No. But to Laura's point, every great artist has influences and they use pieces of their work and bring it into their own, right? [Anne] I don't know, I think Barney's right, I think that what's original is what really matters. You know, art can be subjective and open to interpretation, and when someone creates something that no one else ever has before, it's like it's part of their DNA that can't be owned by anybody Or else... What's the point of authoring anything at all, you know? If all you're gonna do is repurpose, repackage and recycle every idea that comes to you... I think it's dangerous. And I think that he should burn for it. Burn him? - [chuckles] - Burn him. Burn him. Burn him. - [Laura chuckles] - Burn him. - Oh, Jesus, here we go. - Burn him. - Burn him! Burn him! - Burn him. [Anne and Bradley chanting] Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! - Burn him! Burn him! - Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Fuck! [dramatic music] [singing in foreign language] [Dominic] That went well. Seriously. You charmed the pants off everybody. Especially Barney. [chuckles] Oh. Ugh! I don't need to think about Barney with his pants off, that's... [both chuckling] Hm. What were these nights like when Natalia was here? Hey. I wanna help you. Okay... No, really. I... I wanna make up for everything Natalia did to you. How? Well, I know that your grant's an issue, all right? I wanna pay for your tuition. - Dominic... - No, let me, okay? It'll, it'll do me some good, too. [Dominic exhales] Um, you know that this is the week that I have to go into the city, right? No. I told you... when you hired me that I needed the 18th off. - I don't remember. - [chuckles] Yeah? Listen, though, um... What if I don't want you to go? Then convince me. [instrumental music] [both moaning] [dramatic music] [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] [piano music] [Dominic] No, starboard, starboard. Anne, starboard. - Wait, what do I do? - Ah, there, starboard. Here. Cut the motor. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] Whoa, there. [indistinct chatter] - Anne! - Hey! - Hey. What are you doing here? - [Anne] Hi. Um, I'm actually going to the registrar's office. I'm re-enrolling in the fall. - [Brigitte] Oh, that's great. - Yeah. [Brigitte] You got in touch with Natalia? Uh, no, but I figured something else out. Oh. What's that? Um, Dominic is paying for my tuition. I just need to find a supervisor now and... S-s-sorry, Dominic's paying your tuition? Well, now I'm not tied to Natalia. But you will be tied to Dominic. Don't you think? - He's not like her. - I know. But Dominic likes to be in control. He's kind of all or nothing, and it's easy to get swept up. Anyway, it was good bumping into you. Just be careful. - Well, I'll see you soon. - Bye. [knocking on door] Hey. How you doin'? Fine. [gunfire on video games] So, how's home school going? - Okay. - [Dominic] Good. [exhales] I know it's been a bad couple of months and... maybe I haven't been around enough. Look, I know, I know it hurts like hell when someone you love leaves, but... but the important thing for you to know is that... it wasn't about you. You know? It's about the guy she was banging. Look, just, watch your mouth, all right? - Where did these cuts come from? - Nowhere. - Leon. - Nowhere. Let go of me. - Don't touch me. - Let me see. Jesus. Leon... You don't know what it's like. You're never around, and Anne, she's crazy. She goes into fits. What are you talking about? Hey. [Anne] Is something wrong? [engine turns off] Have you seen the cuts on Leon's arms? - What? - [Dominic] His arms. He's been cutting himself, Anne. He says you knew. Dominic, he's lying. He says that you're have seizures. - They're not seizures. - [Dominic] Then what? The meds I'm taking, they make me sleepwalk. What are you talking about? What meds? I have to take them for anxiety since the accident. [Anne] Uh, I'm sorry, I... Oh, God, I'm really feeling sick. [sobbing] [Dominic] Anne? Did you know this was happening? No. [shower running] [dramatic music] [knocking on door] Hey. Hey. When Leon said that you were playing piano in the middle of the night... was he telling the truth? I don't know. It's possible. Dominic, if you want me to go, I will. - I can get the money back. - No. [Dominic] No, no. I don't want that. Anne, come here. Please. What about Leon? Obviously, he's going through something. And I know him. He's a liar. [boat engine revving] [Emily] Go, Anne! [Dominic] Anne, not so go. [Emily] Faster! Faster! [Dominic] Okay, Anne, go, go, go! Watch the buoy. Keep to the left to the buoy up there. - [Anne] The what? - [Dominic chuckles] [Dominic] The buoy. It's like a lane, stay to the... [Anne] Hey there, uh, I was just wondering, do you have any mail for me? [woman] I have something for 88 A-Sharp. - Thanks. - What is it? It says it's for Natalia. Open it. It's from that producer Natalia was working with. It's an advance copy of her new album. With your sonata? It's not mine anymore. [crow cawing] [applause] [piano music] [car indicator ticking] [music stops] You're making me want to slit my bloody wrists. [instrumental music] [Natalia] Just stop, Anne. [Anne] I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment. [Natalia] Let it breathe. [exhales sharply] [piano music] You're rewriting it. [sobbing] [line ringing] [Anne] Hi, this is Anne Wilson. I'm a-a patient with you. Is the doctor in? I'm actually calling because I, I need to switch my meds. [laughter] Sleepwalking is getting worse and, um, I'm starting to hear things. I can't keep that matter to my head and, um, I have this feeling that I've been here before. [Emily] Who are you talking to? I was just talking to my school. - Laura's here. - Okay, I'm coming. - Want to go fishing? - How about after Laura goes? - When's Dominic coming back? - Um, Friday, I think. He's working with his editor this week. Is he almost done or is that just a line to keep us from worrying? I don't know. We don't really talk about it. That's surprising. You guys just seem so close. Is that a problem? What happens when Natalia comes home? Well, they're separated. Anne, those kids, they've, uh, they've been through a lot. And Dominic, I-I just, I really don't know if he's... seeing right. It's not like that. Not like what? Frivolous. Woman to woman, what do you think's gonna happen? I think that you're bored and I think that you're trying to meddle. Oh. I really care about this family, Anne. I've been around a lot longer than you have. Trust me, it's not gonna end well. Dominic's confused. You're confused. And you know what? I did see you here. I'm sure of it. I don't know what to tell you, Laura. I'm not going anywhere. Oh, do you really need the net if we're just fishing from the dock? [Emily] You never know. Last summer dad and I caught a trout. [Anne] Hey, Leon. Okay. Here you go, sweetie. - [Leon] Hey, that's mine! - I'm allowed to use it. [Anne] Maybe there's another net around here. - Give it. - Leon! - Kids, stop it. - [Emily] I need it! [Anne] Leon! Please. It's important to her. - [Emily] Leon, you idiot! - [sighs] - [Emily grunts] - Oh, Emily! Emily, let me do that. Careful, sweetie. - Losers. - Am not. - [Emily groans] - [Anne grunts] [dramatic music] Are you insane? [Natalia] Hey! You can't just take my music. - You're stealing it! - [Natalia] I'm not stealing it. Yes, you are! You put my song on your album. Did you think I was a freakin' idiot? It's called paying your dues. If you can't understand that, we can't continue. [panting] [coughing] [Anne breathing heavily] [indistinct chatter] [Monroe] So when's the last time you saw your wife? [Dominic] Uh, just before Thanksgiving. She brought the kids up for Leon's sailing regatta. [Monroe] So you weren't with the family? [Dominic] No, no, I stayed home. I had a deadline on my book. [Monroe] What about Ms. Wilson? [Dominic] Uh, Anne just started with us in-in June. So your kids were here alone? [Dominic] No, my friend Laura took Leon and Emily to a sailing regatta on Saturday, they stayed the night at her place on shore. Uh, the next day when they got back, Natalia was gone. I came up from the city as soon as Leon called. I was furious because, because I thought that she just walked out on them. - Without saying anything? - That's right, yeah. Was that unusual? Well... she'd been threatening to leave. She, uh... She had a lover. What do you think happened here? Well, Natalia liked to play piano late at night. If she slipped and hit her head or... [Monroe] So it was an accident? [Dominic] Mm, yeah, I assume it was an accident. Sorry, what is that supposed to mean? - How did you get to the island? - Sorry? If your wife never left, then your boat was here. Uh, right, yeah, I had to take a water-taxi over. So if your boat was here, what made you think your wife left? Well, after a few days, it, it became pretty clear. So not when Leon called, but a few days later? [Dominic] H-honestly, I don't exactly remember. Did you know Natalia? Yes. She was supervisor for my masters. [Monroe] So you have been here before, before June, I mean. - What? No. - [Dominic] Uh, sorry, detective. [Dominic] Uh, we just found out that my wife is dead. [Monroe] Of course. I'm gonna head back down. [door opens] [dramatic music] - Anne? - Dom? [Dominic] Yeah? What are your feelings for me? [exhales sharply] Anne... I'm safe with you here, right? [Dominic] Yeah. Of course. You're safe. So what are your feelings for me? Look, I'm tired. Well, here. Here. Come, sleep in my bed tonight. You're okay. [Dominic] Leon, try to eat something. [Leon] I'm not hungry. [Dominic] I know you feel horrible. We all do. Is that why you've been banging her? Leon... - [Anne] It's all right. - No, it's not. Apologize to Anne now. Now! You're so unfair! Stop telling me what to do! I know you wish you weren't my dad. You're just stuck with me. I've had enough of him. Hey. Why don't we go for a canoe ride later, hm? [Dominic] That's it. Way to go, Anne. You want to turn with me, right? [indistinct chatter] [dramatic music] Let's go. Why won't you listen to me? - You can't do this to me! - Hey. Hey! [Anne grunts] [gasps] [Anne breathing heavily] [tires screeching] [gasps] [intense music] [instrumental music] Emily's asleep. Good. Thank you. Can I tell you something? Sure, of course. I love you. Do you love me? Anne, I feel... I do, I, I have... very strong feelings for you. I just... I can't. Right now I can't. Well, that's not what you were saying all those other nights. I know. Anne... Anne. Stop. Anne! Stop. Stop. Please. I can't. I'm sorry. You are treating me just like she did. - No, no. Anne, I am not. - Yes. Anne, Laura told me you were here before. Were you? I told you I was in a car accident that night. [exhales sharply] Yeah. [dramatic music] [gasps] [sobbing] [piano music] You're ruining it. - [Leon] Ruining what? - [gasps] [sobbing] [sniffles] I can't get it out of my head. It's okay. [Anne] I'm so scared. Of what? Him. Him. - [breathing heavily] - [Leon] I hate him. I hate him. [dramatic music] [Dominic] Kids, let's go. This won't take more than a couple of hours. Hey. - I want a pink dress. - I'm not wearing a suit. Well, we'll have to see what they have, there isn't a lot of selection around here, all right? We'll be back soon. Let's go. [door opens, shuts] [cell phone vibrating] - Hello? - [Monroe on phone] Anne Wilson? - Speaking. - [Monroe] It's Detective Monroe. Do you have a minute? Of course. I wanted to speak to you about your whereabouts last Thanksgiving. - Why? - A neighbor said... They saw you and Natalia the day she died. Can you tell me where you were? Yes, um, you know, I was actually in a car accident. Um... It's affected my memory a little bit. [Monroe] I'm sorry to hear that, but we're trying to sort out the details, and we're gonna need to talk some more. How about you come down to the station first thing? Of course. Can I get back to you? Why don't we just say 9:30 a.m. tomorrow? We do wanna get to the bottom of things. Okay. I'll see you first thing tomorrow, Anne. [sniffles] [intense music] [music continues] [Emily] Anne, we're home! Come see my dress! - [Anne] Where's Leon? - I don't know. Uh, by his, uh, his camp, I guess. Are you wearing Natalia's lipstick? You don't like it? Leon? Can you talk right now? I know you wanna be left alone... but I just wanted to say that my mom died when I was your age. It was one of the hardest things I had to go through. You realize how powerless you are when stuff like that gets taken away from you. [sniffles] I don't want you to ever feel that way. I know Dominic hasn't been there for you, but I'm here, if you want. I'm sorry I accused you of lying. How did your mom die? [Anne] Car accident. That sucks. So does this. [Emily] That's the thing, dad, if I just had... - Where are you going? - We're going for a walk. Just me and Emily. I'll come. [Emily] So, Anne, if you imagine me on a scooter, what color would it be? It would be purple. Emily, how are the bites? Should we put some spray on? Hm? [Emily] Yeah, I did, but the bites still are itchy. [Dominic] Oh, yeah? Well, just don't scratch 'em, okay? [indistinct chatter] [intense music] [indistinct chatter] [laptop keys clacking] Okay. Ahem. - How's writing? - It's good. I'm actually getting something done for once, you know? You know, makes me think maybe I should clear this place out, turn it into my study. Fresh start, or something, hm? It's a good idea. You know, I haven't been able to get over my writer's block. Not since Natalia took my music. Mm-hmm? Do you want me to play something for you? Um, honestly, I kind of work better with silence. If that's okay. [Anne] Sure. [laptop keys clacking] I'm sorry for the other day. Hm. I don't want you to feel like you have to do anything you're not comfortable with. Do you mean that? You know, I really owe you and Natalia. I learnt so much from her, even though she was... challenging. And you've given me the gift of going back to school. I think it's time for me to leave. Look, Anne... it's not that I don't want you around and-and I don't neces... [Anne] I get it. Maybe we could pick things up again when everything calms down. Time apart is probably what we both need. After tonight, I'll be gone. Dom? [dramatic music] [breathing heavily] [line ringing] [Monroe on phone] Hello? [Anne on phone] Detective! [sobbing] I'm scared. [Monroe] Ms. Wilson? What's going on? Please help me. He's out of control. He's losing it. [dramatic music] [engine starts] [grunts] [Dominic] Anne? Hey, what's going on? Um... I was having a bad dream. Are you, are you bleeding? You okay? - Go back to sleep. - Oh... Go back to sleep, Dominic. Anne, did you drug me? You know, I think you're having one of your, one of your episodes. Anne... Anne, you're not thinking straight. - [Anne grunts] - Anne! Anne! Wait! S-stop! Just wa... - Wake up. - I am awake. I'm not gonna let what's mine be taken all over again. Anne, I'm not taking anything. Anne! Anne! Listen, please. Snap out of it. [Leon] Anne... [Dominic] Leon? W-what's going on? [Dominic] Leon, listen to me. Go back to the house and call the police. - He killed your mom. - What? No. No! [Anne] Did you know that he was married before? His first wife, she died in a house fire. - Did you know that? - [Dominic] Leon... [Anne] Do you think that's a coincidence? Listen, Leon, it was an, an accident, okay? No, no, it wasn't. He killed her and killed your mom, too. - Stop! - You killed her? [Dominic] No. [Anne] He's lying. Leon, listen to me. Anne is not well, okay? She needs help. Do you understand? No. Look what he did to my face. Um, I'd... He did this. [Anne] Leon, we're next. [Dominic] What the hell are you talking about? She's making all of this up, Leon. Just stop! Stop! - [grunts] - Hey! No, kiddo. Hey. - [Leon groans] - [Dominic] No! [Dominic] No! No, no! [Anne] Dominic? [Dominic] Anne! [Dominic groaning] [groaning] [Dominic breathing heavily] [Dominic breathing heavily] [instrumental music] [Anne] I didn't feel safe. He was being so erratic and... I tried to leave. Then he attacked me. Um, and then Leon came and distracted him. And, um... it all happened so quickly, I... I'm sorry, um... [Monroe] It's okay. You've all had a long night. Okay. Let's, uh, go over the timeline again. [applause] [piano music] [music continues] [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [instrumental music] [music continues]
