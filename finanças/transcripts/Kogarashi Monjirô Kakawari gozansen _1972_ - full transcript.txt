He died 6 months ago. We have another brother. Look, his name is Monjiro. My two other younger brothers died. But this one won't die. Because it's the day of the shrine festival and killing is forbidden. So Monjiro will grow up and won't die. ♪ Kanzaburo, the crow. ♪ ♪ Mama sells dried greens from dawn. ♪ ♪ Pop strikes iron at Kumano. ♪ ♪ One day's wages is 3 cups or rice. ♪ You can buy wild barley and some dried greens. Please take it. But I don't even know you. Ma'am, you mustn't kill your children. Think of the one to be killed. If the person killing you is your parent... the grudge will run even deeper. Excuse me. Wait... - What's the matter? - ...was already dead. She took the two older children with her. Why didn't she leave at least one? Oh, this will cost us. Just because she had a little money... looking at it she wanted to die. What do you want with me? We're with the Tobei family of Imaichi. Monjiro, you know why. I did kill Boss Tobei. But death in a fight is the yakuza way. Shut up. Draw. What? Scared now? No. I don't value my life. Damn you. Die. And I don't need others to help me die. When the time comes, I'll die quietly.

Even! Odds. The bet is made. Open. It's 2-6 even. Another bet, please. Bet please. - Even. - Odds. It's 4-5 odds. Please. You didn't win. If Kogarashi Monjiro can't win this betting parlor is on the way up. Oh, I almost forgot. Bukichi from Tenjinmachi was here a few days ago. - He left a message. - For me? Excuse me. Please. - You won a lot. - Yes, thanks. This happens maybe once a year. It's creeping me out so I'm getting out. You haven't been here for some time. I was in Osaka and further west. I see. I was afraid you were passing us by. You must be joking. No yakuza would pass by Boss Kunisada's joint. This is for the boss. - And this the family. - Thank you. Excuse me, then. And the message? Kinzo, from Boss Tobei's family insists on killing you. He's hunting you with 10 men. I heard he's hired some swordsmen, too. I know you're all right but please be careful. It's little but use it on your travels. Hey, let's go. You belong to the Imaichi family? Where's Kinzo? Kinzo! Come out. Thanks. You saved my life. - Thanks, I'm... - Don't talk. You saved my life. Those two planned to rob me and followed me from the gambling joint. They were after you? I was going to kill them if they attacked but as you see I had stomach pains... All I can do was hide. I was too lucky at gambling so I had a bad feeling. Monjiro, let me thank you again. You know my name? Yes, you don't know me but I've seen you in many gambling joints. I was born in Yahata. I'm a novice named Tsunehei. I was going to approach you when I was more experienced but as you can see... - Are you all right? - Yes. I won't forget this. I will repay you for this. It's not that I wanted to help you. Stop talking about paying me back. That's not possible. You killed those two. It was their fate to die at my hands today. If the pain returns take these. - I'll be going. - Monjiro! Monjiro! Who is it? Dear! Dear! Dear! Idiot. See if anything's missing. Your name, please? Boss, I know for a fact that Monjiro was here. If you asked your family they'll know which way he went. Why won't you tell us? You said your name was Kinzo? - Don't you understand? - No, I don't. He has no ties to the Kunisada family. Why do you protect him? Tell me. Monjiro is our customer. What? Even if for only a minute if he sat here and played... that makes him a valued customer. Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you where he is. - You... - You? Oh yeah? You don't know yakuza etiquette. I can imagine why you and he fought. Get out. I said get out. I'll come back one day and get satisfaction. Let's go. Good riddance. Hey, Okoma. Traveler, come in! Just for a minute. Damn. I found the traveler with the long toothpick. Come on out. How about it? Yes, it's him. Then the reward is mine. I'll give you one ryo. Hey bring some washing up water. Glad to see you again. Here you go. - Have some. - I don't drink. - But I heard... - I don't drink now. I see. Then. It's not cool drinking alone. - I'll drink with you. - Fool. Don't just sit there. Bring him something. I must say my hunch was good. I thought you'd be on the Nikko Road, the back road at that. I was right. As you know, I have some money and the local sake is good. So I've stayed. In addition to the money and the sake, could it be that she's another reason? You see everything. But I won't let you go this time. Don't say a thing and let me entertain you tonight. That would make me feel better. Please, I beg you. All right, if you insist. I'll be your guest. Great! Then... Oh, right. It feels like I made you keep me company. Oh, there's the room. This way. Please. Forgive me. Nothing to forgive. Then I'm glad. Have a nice rest. - Please. - Good night. Good night. Lady, you've got the wrong room. - It's okay. - But I didn't... Your friend already paid me. So don't worry about it. It's muggy tonight. He paid me a lot, so do whatever you want. My, it's hot. What's the matter? Come here. Can you please leave? Leave? I don't know what he thought but I don't want to. Don't be so cruel. I wanted to when I first saw you. See for yourself. Don't keep me waiting. Idiot. What do you take me for? I try to be nice and this is how you treat me? Maybe I'm a bit older but I have experience. They say ride a horse, take a woman. If you are not satisfied afterwards I'll return the money, with interest. What? What's so funny? I don't know how good you are in bed but you're not a good actor. Actor? I have no intention of asking for the money back if you leave. You still insist I sleep with you? You're a dear. You shouldn't be so blunt. I apologize. So won't you let me drink with you? Just a couple of bottles? Take pity on me. So now, it's sake? I see. You know what you're doing. Please? Please? If you want to drink that much, buy your own. Don't you think you've had enough? Please go. All right. Can you hear that? She's the daughter of the house. Only 15 but she's not bad. I taught her that. You won't last if you don't act. What's so good about men? I want to die. ♪ Kanzaburo, the crow. ♪ ♪ Mama sells dried greens from dawn. ♪ Where did you learn that song? I've known it since I was a kid. Where do you come from? What? Now you're interested? - Where? - Joshu. - Where in Joshu? - Nosey. I'm from Nitta, Mikazuki village. What's your name? I have lots. Which one shall I tell you? - When you were a kid? - Omitsu. If you want to know more give me some money. It's interesting. The parents curse upon the child. Omitsu was sold by them. I was sold at 13 to a Takasaki brothel. You thief! I'm sorry. Forgive him. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Forgive him. You stole again... I shouldn't have saved you. Ma and Pa should have killed you. You had a younger brother, didn't you? Skinny and always hungry. Hey, wake up. What? - You stink of sake. - Let me sleep a while longer. Hey, you're Omitsu? Hold out your hand. What is this? Your customer left it for you. I owe him. You must have been really good to him. Is this all mine? Yep, all yours. Wait! Where is he? He left. Left? Who is he? Monjiro. Kogarashi Monjiro. In the yakuza world, he's a junior champion. I'm getting lucky. Lady Luck's smiled on me. What did he say? Monjiro? Where is Monjiro from? Why so interested all of a sudden? Is he from Joshu? - How do you know? - Where was he born? Umm... village somewhere. I heard talk once. Let's see. - Tsukimi... - Mikazuki village. - Yes. - Out of my way. Something's strange with you two. What happened between you two? Hey, tell me. - Hey. - He's my younger brother. I saw you at the hut earlier. Are you a relative? No, just passing by. That's all right, then. I'm going to set the fire. Why are you burning the place? There was a death in that hut. A terrible tragedy. We don't want to be reminded of it. So the association decided to burn it. Like that. As you say, it's better to burn away an awful past. But there are some pasts that remain, no matter how much you burn them. Who's been saying bad things about me? What you did in your past life is important. Because I was good, I have a good brother. You should follow my example. Too envious to speak? Serves you right. For those in his world Kogarashi Monjiro is a man among men. He's not run of the mill. Let's do this. Those who don't want to work tonight come here circle 3 times and bark like a dog. I'll buy your time. How about it Owaka? - I'm done. - Well? Idiot. How about you, Okoma? - Sister... - What? Osen, Osato, Oshiba... Do as you please. Hope your customer is a leper. Oh, yuck! - Sorry. - You did it on purpose. - Say that again. - You did it on purpose. You drunk! Kill me. Go ahead. Ouch! Not again. Stop that. Don't cause trouble again. Kill me. I said kill me. You put a mark on me. Monjiro will come after you. So it's finally started. Fukudas against the Shibuntaki family. Shimotaki family have come to help. This way! Good work! Boss! No matter what, it's going to be a fight. Since you've been with Okoma since you've come it's no wonder you don't know. Could you please hand that over? You've been spitting on it. Thanks. Now where was I? Ever since I've come to stay, I've been with Okoma. So you can't be so relaxed from now on. That's true. This side of the river is the Shimotaki territory. But Rokubei is trying to muscle in. - Rokubei? - Hakoda Rokubei. Since you've been going to Okoma since you've arrived it's no wonder you don't know. Boss! Boss. We're counting on you when it happens. Of course. This is her. Boss Shimotaki wants to talk to you. Say hello. Come in. I hear you're Monjiro's sister. I want to see your brother. Where is he? I don't know. When will he come here next? You don't know that either? He didn't tell me. I told you it was a waste of time. They tell lies for a living. - If you believe them... - Wanna make a bet? - What? - 100, no 1,000 ryo? How about it. Will you bet? Omitsu? We can look for Monjiro. If we tell him you want to see him, will he come? Of course. We need his sword skills. I hear he's not for hire. I want you to ask him. Can you make him say yes? If I ask him, he'll say yes, but... But what? But you have to do what's right. How much is her paper worth? When she came it was 20 ryo. But she drinks and she kept borrowing. So now she owes about 30 ryo. All right. I'll buy up her paper. Not only that. I'll give you a small restaurant to run. Is that true? Yes, but in turn... I know. Don't worry about it. My brother has reason to listen to me. Monjiro. I finally found you. Who are you guys? I'm family of Boss Tobei whom you killed. I'm Kinzo. It's him. - After him. - Don't lose him. Monjiro! Where are you going? To Taiko then Maebashi and Takasaki. I'll take the west route of Nakasendo highway. You're homeless. Arrest him. Do you resist? Get in. - What did you do? - Nothing. I didn't do anything to be put in jail. Me, neither. All of us here. They just arrested us. They're sending us to island prison. Put us in a deep hole where the sun don't shine. Chest deep in water mining gold till we die. Damn them. Don't you care? Off course. But no matter where you are, you can't beat life. Life is hard. Is Monjiro from Joshu here? Wait here. The Shogun's emissary who passed this land on his way to the Nikko Shrine arrived there safely. So we will release you all. I hear Omitsu is your long lost sister. She has asked for us to look for you. Go to her. Mr. Kogarashi. Are you also going to Tamamura? I guess so. They would want to hire you. Which side are you going to help? Hakoda Rokubei wants me. I hope you're not siding with Shimotaki. Is something happening in Tamamura? Don't feign ignorance. - Hey, the boat is leaving. - I can see that. Tell me, which side? If you're siding with Shimotaki, I won't go. I wouldn't want to mix swords with you. I have private business in Tamamura. I see. That makes me feel better. - The boat! - Excuse me. Sister Omitsu. - Your brother. - Is he here? Why are you standing here? You don't have to worry about me. You're such a fool. A real fool. I'm different now. Come in. Come in. Look up and look at me. Show me your face. It's your fault. Why didn't you tell me who you were? You left. Did you write me off? But this is reality. I suffered a lot, too. But never mind. Now that we've met. How I missed you. You've changed. I never would have recognized you. I'm glad you're well. I'm glad you're alive. They said you all died in a mud slide. Were you the only survivor? - I'd left home before that. - Left? I wanted to see you. I was 13. I walked to Takasaki to see you. To see me? Wait, if you were 13, I must have been hiding in Fukaya. - That's right. - Oh, you mean... - When I finally went there. - I was gone? I see. I was involved with a bad man and I had to keep moving. But unlike me, you did well. They say you're famous around here. Can I come in? Sure. We'd be talking tor days. This is Boss Shimotaki. He wanted to see you. It's nice to meet you. I'm... Let's skip the formal greeting. I said I'm different now. Because of the Boss, I don't have to take johns. Of course. You're Monjiro's sister. As a fellow yakuza, I couldn't let that happen. There's something better. This is in the future but Boss is going to let me run a store. - I have a request to make. - Wait. If the request concerns the fight with the Hakoda family please don't say another word. What if I told you I've already agreed. I'm going to be honest. If you kill Rokubei, he'll burn all my debt papers. - How much? - 100 Ryo. It shouldn't be difficult with your skill. That's an easy task for Monjiro. It's been 20 years since we met. Say yes and make me happy. All right. - You'll agree? - Yes. I will get the 100 ryo. Excuse me. Monjiro, wait a minute. Monjiro. Wait, I say. Can't you take pity on me? If you don't kill Rokubei... That has nothing to do with me. - What? - I said I'd get the money. You can say anything you want. It's 100 ryo. You hear, 100 ryo. How are you going to get such a sum? I know, you're going to run. Leaving your only sister behind. Damn you. I won't let you do it. Damn you. I shouldn't have saved you. What? What are you going to do? My mind was made up the first time I saw you. I will get the money. Please wait a while longer. Welcome home. Is Monjiro staying at Tamaruya? He's no longer in town. Did he go to kill Rokubei? Guest? Why are you so interested in Monjiro? He's a fake. - Fake? - That's right. He didn't want to die, so he ignored his only sister's wishes. There must have been a good reason. Oh yeah? What? Even if there was a good reason he should have laid his life down for his sister. Monjiro? He's a laughing stock. - Are you Boss Hakoda? - Who are you? Boss! I'm Kogarashi Monjiro. Who wants to die next? Before morning, all the helpers for Hakoda were gone. The reason is... Because they were afraid of Kogarashi Monjiro. I'm tired of listening to this story. I'll say it again and again. But why did he leave without saying a word to me. - Why? - They're like that. Okoma. I've been meaning to tell you this. I'm not in the mood to hear it. I see. I guess. I'm a lowly kitchen help. I won't say a word. Let's drink. Watch it. You're no match for the likes of me. The only one I'd consent to sleep with is Boss Kunisaga or Boss Oomaeda. Boy, are you conceited. I'm not interested in anyone else. If you get tired of being a yakuza come to me. I'll be opening a shop soon. I'll let you heat the sake. - Thanks for the offer. - Come one come all. Don't talk big when you don't know a thing. Your brother didn't kill Rokubei. - It was someone else. - Who was it? That's none of your business. That's a lie. You're just envious. That's why you're making this up. - Stop it. - Boss. - Is what he's saying... - It's true. We're just pretending it was your brother for now because it's more convenient for appearance's sake. Why would I lie? You'd find out as soon as you talk to Monjiro. You told me you'd take care of it in this room. - I was a fool to believe you. - Boss! I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. I will do anything. Boss forgive me. Boss, I'm sorry. Damn! Beast! Twelve, thirteen, fourteen fifteen, sixteen... Since Boss Rokubei and I were family I shouldn't say this but I think Rokubei was wrong. But we can't let this go unsettled. So we think that if you give us Monjiro's head we'll forget everything. The Hakoda family agrees. Boss Shimotaki, do you agree? If you don't, I'll have to stand by Hakoda. Kinzo, when did I say I disagree? So you agree. No question. Monjiro is an outsider. It's no big deal if he died. Then it's settled. Thanks for letting me handle this. I thank you. Are you ready? Odds. Even. It's even. I lose. You win. Monjiro, I'm an experienced gambler. But I'm no professional. This was a good lesson for me. Thank you. Excuse me. That was a good match. I enjoyed watching you play. I finally made 100 ryo. Please. Monjiro. I was watching from the start. You are so good. I thought you had settled in Tamamura. I had to leave. I need to talk to you about that. I shouldn't say this but you shouldn't go near Tamamura. You are supposed to have killed Rokubei. I heard about that at Minobu. I don't know who used my name... That was me. Boss Shimotaki was bad-mouthing you. So I got really mad. Forgive me. What's done is done. It can't be helped. Tsunehei... I wonder if you'd do me a favor. Don't be so polite. Just order me to do it. I want you to deliver 100 ryo to that person in Tamaruya. 100 ryo? To Omitsu? Then you... Was that the reason you didn't kill Rokubei? Stupid me. I understand. I'd be happy to oblige. - Damn. I'm jealous. - You! I came at a bad time. I didn't want to wake the others. - I know my way around. - What is it? You disappear then you come back like a thief. Let's fight later. Is Omitsu here? - No. - She's not? It's strange. Boss Shimotaki's men took her away. What? Come on in. I'll be right back. So make the john go to sleep. Where are you going? Why won't you say yes? All you have to do is write a letter. What are you thinking? You know. If my brother reads it and comes here, what will happen to him? It'll be like you imagine. You are so concerned about him? Why him? Look at what he did to you the other day. It's no use protecting him and spending the rest of your life in misery. There's a lot of men after Monjiro. In any case, he doesn't have long to live. He was born under an unfortunate star. He shouldn't have been born at all. You're not going to be young forever. Why don't you find someone who'll take care of you? Boss... Oh Boss? - What is it? - Sorry but... What? He brought the money? How long are you going to keep me waiting? Go ask once again. - Hey... - Hello Boss. Omitsu will be right down. It's been a while. We've been pretty busy today. - Did something happen? - It's the Hakoda family. They came after Omitsu. Is that so? So that's why she's here? She'll work here for a while and then they'll give up. Oh, looks who's here. Damn. Seems to be some trouble. Not to worry. Omitsu! Omitsu... I'm sorry to have caused all that ruckus. Damn, he lied again. Tsunehei! Tsunehei? Monjiro's at the Akagi gambling joint. Tell him... The money... Minokichi stole it. Forgive me. - Monjiro, forgive me. - Tsunehei. Tsunehei! I saw if from the start. This is awful. This is too awful. - This just came. - For me? Who is it from? Tamamura, Tamaruya, Mitsu. Could you please read it for me? Are you sure? Don't blame me later. I write to you in haste. Because you killed Rokubei I was able to own my own eatery. I regret that we fought. You are my only brother. I am so sorry that we parted on a sour note. I cry every night. I want to see you again to apologize or I will never forgive myself. If you read this but won't come, I will hate you for the rest of my life. To Monjiro From Mitsu. Is that all? Nothing about the money? No, that's it. I see. I didn't know you had a sister. I'm glad it wasn't bad news. You're going? If she's happy, there's no need to meet. But she says she'll hate you if you don't come. Oh, she'll get over it. Please throw it away. I'll come around when I pass this way again. - Do you know her? - Yes. She had a high fever when she came but she insisted on seeing you. Poor thing. She was in a hurry to get here. Hello? Here's Monjiro. He's here. It's me. Recognize me? Tsunehei was killed by the Shimotaki men. They stole the money. He said to apologize. He asked for forgiveness before he died. Tell me the details. Tsunehei delivered the money to the shop? The shop that Omitsu started. There's no such thing. Why do you say that? She said so in a letter. So she wanted me to come. It's a trap. Don't go. It must be a trap. Who are you? I'm with Shimotaki... uh, I'm from Tamamura. I'm not lying to you. Right now Kinzo from the Imaichi family are there. Imaichi... Kinzo brokered a deal between Hakoda and Shimotaki. The deal is that they kill you. That's the reason for the letter. I don't want to say this but Omitsu was with Shimotaki last night. Your sister's in cahoots with them. I get the picture. I thank you. You intend to go to Tamamura? - Yes. - Don't you believe me? - I do. - Then why? If I don't, they'll kill the letter writer. Even if she's your sister she's not a good person. It's not just she's just my sister. That person made it possible for me to come into this world. He came. TAMAMURA VILLAGE LIMITS He's coming. So it's you. I thought it looked like you so I've been waiting here. I came because I read your letter. So you came. I'm glad. Come look at the shop. It's nearby. This is it. Isn't it big? There's a small room upstairs. This is the kitchen. There's a bamboo grove nearby so I can cook lots of bamboo shoots. The back leads to a mulberry field. Monjiro. I finally found you. Prepare to die. Don't be hasty. You'll get your chance. Throw down your sword. Are you blind? I said throw down your sword. Do as he says. Throw down your sword. Do you want them to kill me? Throw away your sword. Do it. I'll say this. You have spunk, Monjiro. Go. You stick close. Boss! Boss help me. Boss. Damn you. Even if I die there will be another. And if he dies there will be another. You won't have it easy. As long as you're alive you won't have it easy. Even if I die there will be another. And if he dies there will be another. You won't have it easy. As long as you're alive you won't have it easy. THE END
