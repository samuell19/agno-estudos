Rosia Montana, peak of the "auriferous triangle" at the beginning of the century. For many, gold - the symbol of richness - only means hard work, povery and despair. A past that must not be forgotten. THE STONE WEDDING The Stone Wedding, when you've got nothing to put on your stove. When you only have left a daughter and she leaves unwedded. When you act stone cold and leave your home. So you won't be bought at the stone wedding. Open the gate for the wedding, to see who's listening To listen who's watching, to ask him what he thinks. part one (Fefeleaga) Good day! Good day! Good day! Grow up big and strong, boys! Grow up big and strong! Yes... Mine weren't fated to... Under the dragon's sky, down in the world of the gold On the edge of the abyss, at the borough's edge With the devil's metal, agonized and laboured... ...Maria "Fefeleaga" On the hill's slope, I pull with the horse's harness By the mountain lake's dim light, dim as the horse's sight. Only the mountain's sister searches a place for the soul Crossing the bridge over the abyss. Mother, did you bring me... Don't worry, Paunita Mom will buy you a dress. What's up, Maria? Mister said to come for the money. So I came. Yes...he did say. Only he's not at home. -They're 14, Maria. -Yes. Have a good day! What's up, Maria? I came for the money. I'll give you the rest next time. How are you, Maria? You've only got the little girl left . Why don't you try to get married again? All your children are gone. The little one is ill, you're getting old. And no one will marry you any more. They can go marry the devil's mother. Come on, dear, and show us where's the pit buried. From the valley, from the abyss Four tallow candles are burning Neither rain nor snow could have them put out. Only my heart when it's weeping. Come on, dear, and show us where's the pit buried. I keep waiting for my husband to return from somewhere. I keep watching for them come, my sons wherever they are. Come on, dear, and show us where the pit is buried. Dear, my life, light up the candle! Withered as the leaf Because the mischief ones until the supper will make us candlestick for their light, will make earthen lamps out of us. Dear, my life, light up the candle! -Do you have anything else? -Yes. - Fourteen? - Fourteen. Under the dragon's sky, down in the world of the gold On the edge of the abyss... ...Maria "Fefeleaga" No husband, no relatives without anyone around only the horse hears her, the blind and nameless horse. At hardship ??hram?? cu hamul calului By the mountain lake's dim light, dim as the horse's sight. Only the mountain's sister crosses the bridge over the abyss. Maria "Fefeleaga" -Do you still need a horse? -Yes, I want one. -Where is it? -Outside. I'd like a dress, a veil and a wreath. A wreath... No husband, no relatives, no one in the world to hear her only the horse, who had a back able to climb the hill No husband, no relatives, no one in the world to hear her only the white horse... Keep well, our dear, For your little girl will go away. You will stay and she will go Over valleys and mountains, over waters, bridges. She has brothers brothers among firs And parents as flowers, and brothers just as the heavens They are calling her from heavens. At the mirror of the lake nearby Under the dark seal, at the lake's cradle There's a white house without a necklace Who's living there? There's a cemetery. You can see a mother. part two (At a Wedding) Where are you going? -I'm performing at a wedding. -Ah, yes... At a wedding? Wait, I'm coming too. I was a drummer in the army. I know how to play the drum too. What shall we do with these clothes? Don't worry, we'll find better ones. -Thats how you play it, see? -Yes, yes. -Leave him, he brings bad luck. -Wait... Don't hit it so softly! -How, then? -Stronger, faster. -Come on, try! -Watch! -Look, you need to keep the rythm. -Yes. Wait for my signal and hit it. Come on, try! -Did you see? -I've got it, yes. Have a good day, bride and go and get wedded. From brothers and sisters from the flower garden. From girls and boys, from the green grove. From boys in the alley... Good day to you! What brought you here, facing us? What made you start on an unknown path Did our young groom wake up in the morning Nicely combed his hair, a crowd he gatherd And at dawn he went hunting Through mountains with firs, dales with violas, villages with girls And there he stopped and a doe he found. What's up with that order? Is the brandy still coming? Good day! -Do you have musicians' clothing? -No but I have other kinds. -Do you want to see them? -Yes. A lot of people come to me. I used to have a large orchestra, now I only have some soloists. Here's a clothes tree if you want to pick something What are you waiting for? I'm not giving you any money today, go outside and play. I have some clothes in this closet too. -Who do you need them for? -For my friend there. -Here, do you like this? -Yes. This? What do you have in that sack? Nothing. This - not. Here, some shoes, if you want. She could have waited longer. -More wine is neded at the table. -Hold the bottle so I can poor some. Good thing he's marrying her. She was driving all boys crazy. He's marrying her with Ciuipitu's wuss. Wuss but his father has twelve oxen. And a lot of gold You have gold one day and the next is gone. From boys, from the moon, for I won't hold your hand any more Bride, your darlings... Tell us, tell us, maiden who will your mother marry you to? Will she give you to merchants, great land owners or fiddlers? Love for a musician: gold and jewels, the pocket is full of money. Go, go to the walnut's shade And wash your feet for your groom is like a flower and bride, good day. Have a good day, bride, and go and get married. From brothers and sisters, from the flower garden, from girls and boys, from the green grove. From boys in the alley, from the thick green grass. Do you want to eat? Have a good life! Cheers! Have them sing! Cheers! A good life to your youngsters. Bring the boys some food! Here, boys, refresh yourselves. -Good day! -How was the journey? Rather hard, we went over the large hill. It was hot, dusty. -Who's the boy? -A friend of mine, plays very well. He helps me. -What will you sing us? -Whatever you want. -Will a lot of people dance? -Well yes, everybody. -Take it away! -If only it won't rain. -You like it, eh? -I'll play the cithera if you want, with the pipe... We're looking for a deserter. Has he hidden here? Well...look around for him! The bride should be serious when she leaves the parents. ...Seriousness... Come on! Why don't you want to dance? Come on and dance! Want to taste? Good day, Lawyer! Will you play anything else? Come on! The bride is looking at you. Mind your own business! All the girls are going to the walnut's shade. I'm the only one not going to the walnut's shade. For my man at home won't let me. He's afraid I'll get lost in the green forest. Girls are going gladly to the beech's shade. But my man at home won't let me too. He's afraid a wolf will come out from the thick forrest. He's afraid of a bride gone lost. Girls are going at the fountain holding hands with boys. But my man at home won't let me too. But I'm going in the garden with another one, holding hands. And we're hiding behind the house, in the thick forrest. Girls are going at the fountain holding hands with boys. But my man at home won't let me too. But I'm going in the garden with another one, holding hands. And we're hiding behind the house, in the thick forrest. All the girls are going to the walnut's shade. I'm the only one not going to the walnut's shade. In our parts, in an old house a bride is weeping badly She's not crying 'cause she's guilty She is crying 'cause she's a stranger Mine wasn't a girl's wedding It was a stone wedding. I had nothing to lay on the stove, and I woke up fully clothed In silk, all white. And I saw myself wedded together with the ugly one. In our parts, in an old house a bride is weeping badly chosen against her will, servant in the rich man's house. I will run unwedded from the richness' uglyness. I will run unmarried from this cursed wedding. I will run when he will come... ..my man, wherever he is. For I loved you since a child...
