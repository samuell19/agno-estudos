- The discovery of this ancient painting in one of the most famous temples was of major importance. It was a signpost in the wilderness of clues. There can be no doubt that these white lines represent gaseous vapors. Further research reveals conclusively that the natives had a rudimentary but practical knowledge of what we know today as poison gas. With this difference, the gas which the natives evolved had a diabolical power. Its effect was more frightful than anything conceived by modern science. We have lethal gasses which are used for a definite purpose, to kill. The poison gas of the natives too had a definite purpose, but it did not bring death. It brought death in life, or, if you prof er, life in death, To appease their gods, they offered the heart taken from a living victim, or, when necessary, from one recently deceased, Ironically enough, to carry out this savage rite, our surgery students will detect a remarkably advanced cardiectomy technique in the incision. And although chemistry, not surgery, is my province, this picture combines both chemistry and surgery, a fact which opened up a new field of research, Now, while you students are enjoying your summer holidays# I shall explore that field further. When you return to this classroom for the next semester, you'll learn what I've discovered. Good afternoon, and a pleasant holiday to you all. Allison! How did you like my lecture, Ted? - I found it extremely interesting, Doctor. - I thought you would. Confidentially, I'm much further along in my research than I led the class to believe. - You mean that you? - Yes, I said that during the vacation I expected to recreate the native poison gas. that was a slight deviation from the truth. I've already done so. - that's wonderful, Doctor, - Of course, I must check and recheck before I can make my findings public. Until then, what I've told you is in confidence. - Naturally, Doctor. I'm highly flattered that you chose to confide in me. - Why not? The school of medicine expects you to do great things someday. I guess I have a knack with the knife, but it won't do me much good if I don't pass your chemistry course. - You could do with a little more work in the lab. that's what I want to talk to you about, - Is it that bad? - No, no, no, but I could use an assistant, How would you like to spend your vacation helping me with my experiments at home? - Would I? Say, there isn't a fella in the class who wouldn't give a leg to work with you in the lab. - Well, that's rather more than the privilege is worth. You needn't give me a leg, just lend me a hand. - When do I start? - Right now. - Fine. Only I just remembered... Yes. You're thinking of Isabel's broadcast. We can hear that from my place. - Well, that's all right, if you don't mind. - No, no, of course not. Next to science, music is my great love, and I've always been interested in Isabel's career. # Our love will live through the years # # Throughout our joy and our tears # # This dream we hold and cherish # # Cannot perish # # Things may come and go # # But we always will know # # Our love will live through the years # # Throughout our joy and our tears # # This dream we hold and cherish # # Cannot perish # # Things may come and go # # But we always will know # # Our love will live # You have just heard Miss Isabel Lewis, University City's own bright particular star in an all-request program. - Isn't she wonderful? Imagine me being engaged to a girl like that. - Yes, you're a very lucky young man. Don't I know it. - You think you could forget Isabel long enough to get back to science? - I'll try. - Let's go downstairs to the lab. This is my private universe, - Why, you've got everything here, - Yes, everything, the world in a test tube. And in hero, perhaps a secret from beyond the world. what do you see? - A dead monkey, Why, why, it's alive! - Yes. that's what I meant in my lecture by life in death, - How did you bring this state about, Doctor? - You know I told you that I had recreated the native formula. Here it is, - that's innocent-looking stuff. - I must warn you about that. These crystals and the gas they give off are colorless and odorless, therefore, the more deadly. If you have occasion to work with this innocent-looking stuff, at all times wear this mask. - Apparently, the little monkey here forgot his. - Yes, when I exposed Jocko to the gas, he too thought it was innocent-looking stuff, but it's affect on him was almost instantaneous. Physical changes took place within a few minutes. - what sort of changes, Doctor? - First there was an appearance of emaciation, followed by more marked physical changes and then by paralysis of the will. This condition, inevitably, will terminate in death. - Then you plan to conclude your experiments by allowing this animal to enter that terminal stage? - No, Ted, that's why you're here. - Me? - We together are going to reverse the action of the gas. You saw those slides this afternoon. One showed them cutting the hearts from living victims, supposedly one of their pagan rites. In my research, however, I deduced that this custom was not to appease their gods as they would have you believe, but to restore life to the gassed victims, Combined with certain herbs, the hearts taken from the newly dead served their purpose. I have the herbs. There is the heart. You mean, you want me to perform a cardiectomy? - You sound reluctant. You're not squeamish about the surgery? - I've performed too many dissections to be squeamish, Doctor. - Good, When you severed this heart, did you notice the dilatation of the ventricle that creates the largo bladder clot? Now, the extract from that clot combined with these herbs serves as the antidote. Now... - I can't help feeling a sense of evil in all this, - Moral concepts. I am a scientist, To me there is no good or evil, only true or false. I work with one, discard the other. Look, - Motion is returning. - We've done it. - Congratulations, Doctor. Your experiment is a complete success. - Yes, it's a success, but not quite complete, There's one element lacking. what's that, Doctor? - Human intelligence. Just think what it would mean if we could repeat this experiment in a human being. Now, just a minute, Doctor. You're not suggesting that I do this type of cardiectomy on a human? - No, no, no, of course not. I was carried away for a moment. Well, my boy, we've made history today. that calls for a celebration. Come along. Thanks, Doctor, but I'm afraid I... Another engagement? - Yes, it's Isabel. She promised to have dinner with me this evening, You see, she leaves on her tour in a few days. She's been so busy, I've hardly seen her for weeks. - Yes, of course, I'd forgotten all about the concert tour. I'd like to see her too and wish her godspeed before she leaves, Why don't you bring her over here after dinner, and we'll all celebrate together? - Fine, I know Isabel'd like that. - Good, then I'll be expecting you, - Till this evening then, Doctor. - Isabel, come in! It's good to see you again, - Thank you, Dr, Morris, It's good to see you, but, I've been so busy, - I know, but you've been near me in spite of yourself. I've heard you on the radio, and I have all your recordings. And I'm glad you asked for a personal appearance tonight. - She's not kidding, Doctor. She wasn't half as glad to see me. Ted. what an interesting room, Why, it's a miniature museum. - It's a modest enough collection, but it has the virtue of authenticity. - what's that? that's Jocko, the miracle monkey. - He was of great service to us in the lab today, so we thought he deserved to share in the celebration. - Absolutely. - If you two will make yourselves at home, I'll see about something to celebrate with, - Miracle monkey? - I can't tell you about it yet. Besides, I've had enough science for one day. Darling, is anything the matter? - No, of course not, I... I'm just tired. - We shouldn't have come. Besides, I'd hoped you'd say you wanted us to be alone this evening. - Well, you promised Dr. Morris, and... - Yes, I know, but I'd still like to hear you say it. - Aren't you being a little inconsistent? - I don't know. I don't know anything except that I'm terribly in love with you, and I have a strange feeling that you're drawing away from me. - Well, you see I'm still here. I haven't moved an inch. - Darling. Ted? - Yes, Dr. Morris? - I just remembered your reputation as an artist with a cup of cheers. Would you mind? - Not at all, Doctor. - You'll find everything you need on the sideboard, You're unhappy, Isabel. - Why do you say that? - You've given so much happiness to others with your golden voice, your loveliness, but tonight you're not the Isabel I know. - I'm sorry if I seem a little upset. - I understand perfectly, dear. You're no longer in love with Ted. - How did you guess? My dear. Don't you suppose that I know how a woman should look at a man when she loves him? - Yes, you're right. I'd give a great deal if it hadn't happened. - But it had to happen. In some ways, Ted is only a child. In his field, he's brilliant, but his field is narrow. For you, music has opened up a great new world. You've traveled. You've outgrown him. - Yes. Yes, you're right. - It's perfectly natural now that you should turn to a more sophisticated man, a man who could share your great joy in music, a man who knows the hook of life and could teach you how to read it, - what shall I do? I meant to toll him tonight. that's why I called him. I tried, but I couldn't. Now I'm afraid I never can. - Do you want me to help you? - How could you? - Sometimes destiny itself solves these problems, This may be one of the times, Isabel. Suppose something should happen that would make Ted himself break off the engagement? - But I can't imagine... - I can. I can see him... Whoa there, within! - Say nothing to Ted. Thank you, This is my masterpiece. - Thank you, - Better be good. - I hope you like it. It's my own concoction, - Well, to your success, Doctor. - And here's to a brilliantly successful tour, - To us. I'm sorry, Ted. How clumsy of me. - Now, you be a good boy, Jocko, Good morning, Doctor, I heard our little friend chattering away in the ball after I rang the hell, and I took it as an invitation to come in. - that's quite right, Ted. I want you to feel perfectly at home here now that we're working together. Thank you, Doctor, what's the program this morning? - Today, we start a new line of research, - Good. - I wish you'd get me the plans and charts from my laboratory desk. I want to go over our findings together. - Right. Dr. Morris? - Yes? - I wanted to thank you for having us over last night. Before we came, Isabel seemed nervous and upset, but Being here seemed to do her good. She was like a new person afterwards. - Well, I'm very glad if I helped in any way. - Helped? As a matter of fact, I'm going to call her this afternoon. I'm going to ask her to marry me, today, before she goes. I lay awake all night getting up my courage. Now I'm going to do it. - Well, good luck to both of you. - Thank you, Doctor. Dr, Morris? Dr, Morris? Doc... - Stand up. Sit down. Now listen carefully. You understand me? Answer me. - I understand you. - Good, I'm your friend, your only friend. You're ill. You need me, I alone can cure you. You'll do everything I say. - Everything you say. - You'll devote your life to science. I will make you well. I'll make you famous, but you will forget Isabel. - Forget Isabel. - Isabel doesn't want you. She doesn't love you. It's me she loves. Do you understand? Isabel loves me. - Isabel loves you. - Now, Ted, you stay here. Do you understand? Stay hero. - Stay here, Stay hero. - Hello. Dr. Morris. Much better since I talked to you last night. - I'm very glad to hear that, my dear. I'm calling to hid you au revoir and to deliver a message from Ted. No, I'm afraid ho won't be able to see you off. He collapsed suddenly while we were at work. No, it isn't serious, mostly overwork. But I've persuaded him to go to bed for a few days, both for his own sake and to save you the ordeal of his goodbye at the train, - But if he's ill, I hate to leave without seeing him. Couldn't I... - No, no, no, I know you have a concert. No, don't think of staying over. Ted will understand. Goodbye, dear. Ted, dig. Now, Ted, you must perform a cardiectomy. You understand? A cardiectomy so that I can make you well, - It's hard to make anything out of these footprints, They're all mixed up! - I know, but do the best you can, We've gotta have some measurements, - How could all this happen and me not see anything nor hear anything? - It'd take a Sherlock Holmes to figure that one out. Well, McClure, what's on your mind? - The thing to look for. The thing to look for in this case, Sarge, is the motive, - Yeah, I need a smart newspaper man to tell me that, Well, you got any ideas? - Nothing very hot. One thing is certain, you got a maniac to deal with, - Yeah, what kind of a maniac? - You got me there, but the body snatcher routine is out. They take the whole corpse for that. what would anybody want with just a guy's heart? - You know, Bailey was district attorney a while back. Maybe some guy he sent up did it. - No, why would they wait for revenge till Bailey's dead? Besides, this was no amateur operation, This was done by an export, Concentrate on exports, Sarge. - How does our department got along without you? - They don't. - Ted. Tod! - what happened? what am I doing in bed? - You had a sudden attack of vertigo, and I brought you in hero. Then you just passed out. - that's ridiculous, I've never passed out in my life. - Never before, perhaps. - I do remember feeling dizzy. - Is that all you remember? - Yeah, No, I had some crazy dreams, regular nightmares. - Nightmares? - Yes, there's something about Isabel and you. You seemed to be telling me that Isabel was in love with you. that's funny, isn't it? what else did you dream? - I guess that's all. I seemed to be walking and walking in the dark, and I was awfully tired. I still am, as a matter of fact. - You'd better rest, and I'll see about something to eat for you. - I am hungry. what time is it? - It's late afternoon. - Holy cats! I've got to get hold of Isabel! - Ted, you're too late. Isabel's gone. Gone? - Yes, she left last night. - How long have I been out, for Pete's sake? - Since yesterday morning. - Great Caesar's ghost, I've lost a whole day. I was supposed to see Isabel off. She'll think that I... - No, she won't. I explained to her, She was very sorry and concerned, but she had to go. Now, don't worry. I'm your physician now, and I order you to rest. - All right, Doctor. I could knock myself out all over again for cracking up at a time like this, - Well, that happens to the best of us when we've been overworking. - Your reporter's had a wide experience in the field of crime, but he's never encountered anything as shocking or so baffling as the work of this unknown ghoul, The police are, therefore, looking for a surgeon who, for some mysterious reason, wanted a dead man's heart. Your reporter will keep you informed of further - - Dr. Morris, I'd like to talk to you. - And I want to talk to you, Ted. We've got important work to do. - I'm sorry, Doctor, but I'll have to ask you to get along without me for a few days. - Why? - I've got to see Isabel. I'll go to the town where she's opening. - You can't go now. You can't walk out on me. Our little friend's had a relapse. - Little Jocko? - Don't you understand what this means? It means that the antidote is only effective temporarily, To keep him alive, we've got to keep on getting fresh heart substance. Ted, we've got to find a permanent cure. - I know how important this is to you, Doctor... - To me? I think you should be concerned too. - I am, but, well, seeing Isabel right now's important to me too, There are some things I've got to get settled. I want to be sure. - You're letting those nightmares upset you. - No! Maybe, I don't know. All I know is I've got to see her. - But you're not well enough to go to her now. I'm fit as a fiddle. - Suppose you have a relapse. - Like little Jocko here? After all, I haven't gone through what he did. Besides, you said yourself, I was only overworking. - that was a superficial diagnosis. But, in all fairness to Isabel, before you ask her to marry you, you must be sure of your health. - I'm all I right! I've never been sick in my life, I've got to see her, I'm sorry, Doctor, but I'm going. - All right, Ted, since you're determined, I'll go along with you, that'd be great. Only, if you're going just on my account. - Don't worry about me. I could use a holiday myself, - Good! Poor little Jocko. - Yes. # I dreamt, I dwelled in marble balls # # With vassals and serfs at my side # # And of all who assembled within those walls # # that I was the hope and the pride # # I had riches too great to count # # I had hopes of a high ancestral name # # But I also dreamt which pleased me most # # that you loved me still the same # # that you loved me # # You loved me still the same # - what happened, darling? You rushed off so suddenly. Ted, here in Camden City. Isabel, Isabel, let me handle this. You know this may be the time to tell him. - But if he's sick, Eric, - He can't be very sick if he traveled here. But you will be if this keeps up, you know. I'm going to talk to Ted myself. No, please don't do that, Eric. I'll tell him. I promise, I'll tell him tonight. - Hello, Ted, how are you? - Eric, good to see you, - Nice to see you. - Congratulations, my dear, - Thank you, Dr, Morris, - And here's Ted. - Darling, I just had to sec you, - How do you feel? Are you all right? - Of course I am. Dr, Morris keeps treating me like an invalid. - As a matter of fact, I didn't think he should make the trip, But he insisted, so I thought I'd come along and keep an eye on him, - that was nice of you, Dr. Morris. I forgot, you don't know Eric. This is Eric Iverson, Dr. Morris, - How do you do, sir? - Eric's my contribution to music. I introduced him to Isabel. - And a very important contribution too, - Well, thank you, Doctor, and for that very nice compliment, may I invite you for a drink? Would you like to join me in my dressing room? - I think that would be an excellent idea, - Excuse me. Gee, it's wonderful to see you again. - Are you sure you're well enough to be here? - Of course I am. Dr, Morris keeps tel ling me I shouldn't take any chances, but it's nothing serious. Too much plugging for mid-year exam, not enough sleep, hardly ever a chance to see you, so I blacked out. - I think Dr, Morris is right. You should do as he says. - Well, if you feel that way, I better tell you all he said. He says I should release you from our engagement until I'm sure about my health. There's nothing wrong with me that a little rest and being with you won't cure. I came to ask you to marry me, tomorrow. But if you're afraid to, if you're afraid. If you're... - Ted. what is it? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. Ted, what's the matter? Dr, Morris. Dr, Morris! Ted, why don't you answer me? Dr, Morris! Dr, Morris! Something's happened to Ted. - I expected this. Leave me alone with him. I know just what to do. Come along, Ted. You'll he all right. I'll take care of you, - Take care of me? - that's rig ht. Come along. - I tell you, Gavigan, the mutilation of that Bailey corpse and the murder and mutilation of that little guy in Camden City are the work of tho same fiend, - Okay, okay, we'll get complete coverage from the press association, - But if you send me down there you'll get better coverage. I've cracked, well, I mean, the Sun helped the police crack three out of the five most important cases in the last two years, Remember the Ambley murder case? Remember the... - Yes, I remember. what do you want me to do, give you a badge with detective on it? - No, just give me an expense account. - Okay, okay, if you're goin', go on! - Get out! - Thanks, Chief. Hey! - Watch who you're humping, McClure. - Whom, baby, not who. Remember, you represent culture on the Morning Sun. - From the smirk on your face, you're getting ready to represent the murder-solved-while-you-wait department again, - Right, little girl, Sleuth McClure rides again. - what's it this time? - The ghoul, baby. Last known to operate in Camden City. that one. You have my blessing, McClure, after the way he messed up Isabel Lewis's concert. - Look, sugar, I'm talkin' about murder, - Well, so am I. Isabel Lewis wowed them in Camden City. I won't up to cover the concert, and I know, But did she get a break in the papers? No, because everything was pulled to spread the story of your ghoul. I just happened to remember, I got an expense account. Come on, I'll take you to lunch, - that's why I asked you to meet me here this afternoon. - Isabel, in every town, I've tried to make Ted let me take him home, but. - I know. You're afraid he'll have another attack. that's why I wanted to talk to you alone. I've looked forward to this tour so much, and it's turned out to be a nightmare. - He feels obsessed. He's convinced that if he goes home or if he doesn't stay as close to you as possible, that something very terrible will happen, However, he has agreed that he's seriously ill, and that he can't think of marriage. - Yes, he told me that. He was so pathetic, so eager for me to say he was wrong, but I was so afraid he'd have another of those terrible attacks that, well, I... - Yes, I know, you encouraged him. that was neither wise nor fair to anyone concerned. - I know. that's what Eric said. that's why we're both, Eric and I, turning to you for help. - Eric and you? - Yes, I guess you've seen how we feel about each other, I can't understand Ted not seeing. - We see what we want to see most of the time, Isabel. Even I, a scientist, have such moments of weakness. - Then, then you will help us? - what is it you want me to do, you and Eric? - Well, Ted hasn't had an attack for several days now, He must be well enough to face the truth, and, well, we thought that you'd be better to tell him because, well I, you're a doctor, and you'd know best how to say it and when. Then, after he knows, he'll surely agree to go home. - When he knows, I think Ted will agree to anything. - Then you'll do it? You'll help us? - You'll let me choose my own time? Of course, of course. - Very well. - Well, men have died for less than holding hands, Professor. Don't mind him, Dr. Morris. It's his idea of humor. - I don't flatter myself that I've made him jealous. - Isabel told me you wore going to be hero, so I thought I might persuade you to have dinner with us. - No, I'm afraid not. I must go and look after Ted. - We're both very grateful to you, Dr, Morris, - It's been my pleasure. Ted, we are not going to the concert tonight, - Why not? - Because we're going home. I'm taking you home. - I'm going home when Isabel goes. - You're sick. This senseless obsession to follow Isabel is a phase of your illness. - Are you suggesting that I'm losing my mind? - I'm telling you that you're a sick man, a very sick man. - what's the matter with me? Why am I always having these awful nightmares? what happened to me, Dr. Morris? Tell me! I feel like I, I... what's? - Ted? Can you hear me? - I, I hear you, - I have important news for you. Listen carefully. I know why Isabel doesn't want to marry you, Eric is responsible. Do you understand? - Eric? - Yes, Eric, your friend, He's taken her away from you. Eric is treacherous. - Treacherous. - We must get rid of Eric. - Get rid of Eric. - Come hero, Ted. Sit hero. Now, write what I tell you. - Dear Eric, I must talk to you alone. I'll meet you at tho stage door at midnight, Ted. - I just received it. - But, but why all the secrecy? Why at mid night? Why alone? - I don't know, but I'll soon find out. Eric, I don't like it. Ted hasn't been himself lately, and, well, there's something strange about tho whole thing. Please don't go, - Nonsense, darling, Ted wouldn't hurt a fly. - Well then I want to be there too. - No, no, no, no. Ted said alone, and alone it is. - Yes? Five minutes, Miss Lewis. - All right, - Now, Ted, listen carefully, Eric is waiting at the end of the alley. Do you understand? - Eric is waiting, - Remember, Eric betrayed you, You must kill Eric. - Kill Eric. Kill Eric. Kill Eric. Eric! - Darling, why did you come here? I told you not to follow me. - I had to. I got more and more frightened, and just before midnight, I couldn't stand it any longer. - There, there, you see, you're just working yourself up into a lather over nothing. I'm perfectly safe. But tho shadows. - Nonsense, there are no shadows. - Hey, McClure. - Hi, sugar, what are you doin' here? - Checking out. I came up last night for Isabel Lewis's recital, building up her homecoming for her final concert Saturday night. what's with you? - With me it's ghoul trouble, baby. The devil was digging up the graveyard right here in this town last night while you were listening to the angel sing, I hopped a plane and came down here, but that's all the good it did me, - No clues? - Nothing. The only thing I'm sure of is that this guy, or whatever he is, is the same in every case. Let's get a drink. - Okay, - It's always the same routine. Each time, a fresh grave, except that time when he killed the caretaker. Then he had a fresh corpse. - Ooh. I'm glad I picked music. - Look, every place he operated the heart was removed by a skilled hand and with exactly the same technique. - Let me see that a minute. - Two Manhattans. - This is funny. - what's funny? - Well, Isabel Lewis was operating in these same towns, only she was tearing their hearts out with music. - You mean to say that your gal and my ghoul have been playin' the same circuit? - that's it. One of life's gruesome little coincidences. - Say, what sort of a gal is she? - Take it easy, McClure. You're not suggesting anything so fantastic... - Hey, look, nothing's too fantastic for this case. When did she play those towns? - This gets curiouser and curiouser. She sang in every one of these towns at the same time as the crime was committed. But I still say... - I don't care what you say. This is the closest thing to a hot tip I've had, and I'm gonna follow it. Where does she sing tomorrow? - Cranston then back home. - that's good enough for me. I'm goin' to Cranston with ya. Pay for the drinks, baby. I'm gonna pack my bag. - I have been the leading mortician of Cranston for 30 years, Mr. McClure, but such a strange request has never come to me before. - The reasons for such a strange request never existed before, Mr. Eagan. - Quite true, quite true. that's why I listened to you at all. But I cannot believe that this monster would dare to desecrate the sanctity of Cranston's honored dead. And yet... - And yet a monster wouldn't be expected to develop a sense of honor even in Cranston, would be, Mr. Eagan? - No, no, I suppose not, but even assuming that you are right in believing that he will strike here next, why should he choose this particular deceased? - For three good reasons. One, he always chooses the newly buried as his victim, Two, he must read the obituary news to find them, Three, this corpse... Deceased, - Deceased is more accessible than one already interred. True, true, This may be the means of saving the deceased from a horrible mutilation. Mr. McClure, I believe it is my duty to help you. - I knew you would. Now, I don't want you alone, I don't want anybody around takin' any chances. I'll handle this all I alone, Now, here's all you have to do. In the first place..., what kind of a corpse do I make, Mr. Eagan? - Very nice, very nice indeed considering you have the disadvantage of being alive. Now, if I were preparing you... - Never mind, that's one disadvantage I want to keep for a while, Everything all set? - I hope so. I told my chapel attendant that I would take charge of everything. I still think you should have brought the police. You can't get a cop interested unless you got evidence, and I'm doin' this on a hunch, Now, fix those lilies so they hide my gun. - I'm terribly worried about leaving you here alone, - Forget it. I don't think I'll be alone very long, and, tomorrow, you and I will be sensational, - Remember, for goodness sakes, whatever you do, don't mar this coffin. - Get 'em up, up, brother, up. - The reports of your death seem to have been greatly exaggerated. that's too bad. We counted on performing this cardiectomy with a minimum of effort. - Well, I'm delighted to disappoint you. Now, if you'll just turn around. - You don't seem to understand, This is important to me, and more so to my friend behind you. No you don't. - Al I right, Ted, we're ready. - Why don't you stop? Why, that gag's got whiskers. - Here's the route. It looks as though the ghoul's deliberately swinging around to come back where he started from. If he strikes here again, the vicious circle closes. - It closed in Cranston on Ken McClure. He played a hunch there and lost, but it was a good hunch all right, all right, too good. - Macklin, you've got to get the maniac that killed him, He'd done more toward crackin' this thing than any of you, now you've got to finish it. - We'll finish it. - Anyone in this town that gets into a cemetery tonight won't get out alive. - Miss Elliott, tel I me more about this man that travels with the Lewis girl, the accompanist. - Eric Iverson? - Yes. - He seems like a perfectly normal, nice person. He's a fine musician just as she is. It can't be possible that they could be involved, And yet... - Well, thanks very much, Miss Elliott. You've been swell. We'll take it from here. Miss Lewis? - Yes. - I'm Sergeant Macklin with the homicide division. This is Detective Garrity, - How do you do. - I'd appreciate a few moments of your time. - what could you possibly want to see me about? - Well, for one thing, I want to welcome you back to the home town, We're all very proud of you, you know. - Thank you. Come in. Won't you sit down? - Thank you. - Thank you. - Well, tonight's the big night, isn't it, Miss Lewis? - Yes. - You'll have all the home town people out to hear you. - It's nice of you to show so much interest, Sergeant Macklin, but I'm sure that's not what you came to talk about. - I notice the press gave you quite a big play. It's too bad you had to share the spotlight everywhere you went with a homicidal maniac. - You mean those dreadful grave robbings? - And murder. - Yes, it was horrible. Imagine it happening in almost every town I sang. - Yes, in every town you sang, that's what got us to thinking that maybe you could... - Why, why you can't think that? So that's what you're here for. It isn't possible that you, that anybody believes that I... - No, no, no, of course not. But you may be able to help us, - Well, how? I know nothing about it. It's just a horrible coincidence. - Well, yes, that's what it looked like until Ken McClure tried to heat this coincidence to the punch. You were giving a concert in Cranston. He had a theory the ghoul would be there too, and he was right. The only trouble is he didn't live to tell us what he discovered, Miss Lewis, I want you to tell me everything you know about your accompanist. - Eric? No, Eric couldn't be mixed up in this. Why, why, he's, well, we're engaged! - Suppose he's two people, the man you love and the ghoul? - The ghoul? - Yes, haven't you ever heard of schizophrenia? Split personality. No, not Eric. I don't believe it. - what are his interests aside from music? Does he care anything at all about science? Has he ever studied medicine or surgery? - No, never, I'm sure of it! - Well, these atrocities were committed by more than one man. Is it possible he has a scientific friend that may have connived with him? - Eric never had any interest but music, and most of his friends are.., - Yes? Most of his friends? - Are musicians and artists. - I see. Well, thank you very much, Miss Lewis. - Thank you. - Good luck tonight. - Thank you. Hello, Doctor. - Why, Isabel, aren't you due at the concert? - I just had to talk to you first. - By all means, come right in. what is it, Isabel? what's troubling you? - Doctor, have you ever known a schizophrenic? - Yes. - Could Ted be like that? - what gave you that idea? - Because he's in trouble, Doctor. Ted's in dreadful trouble. - what trouble am I in, dear? Ted, those horrible things that kept happening on the tour, the murders and the hearts, cutting out those hearts, - Isabel, Ted knows nothing of all that. He was far too ill to read anything so shocking. I kept the papers from him. - Tell me, Isabel, tell me. - The police, they think Eric is mixed up in it. They think he's a schizophrenic, and somebody else, they said, somebody that knows surgery, like you, Ted. But I didn't tell them you were there. I didn't tell them, and Eric couldn't be mixed up in it, could be? - No, dear. Eric couldn't be, not in 1,000 years. - My child, where did you get such a fantastic notion? I've been with Ted practically every minute. You're making yourself ill over the wild imaginings of an ambitious detective. - You're sure, Doctor? - Of course I am. I'm sorry, Ted, Please forgive me. - Well, there's nothing to forgive. You love Eric, don't you? It's all right. I'm glad, because I'm very ill. I didn't realize it before, but I know now. You're free, Isabel. She's right, isn't she, Doctor? - It was an accident, Ted, I swear it. - I remember, those nightmares. I must've been in the pit of hell. - But for me, you would've died. I risked my life. - Murder and mutilation of the dead. - When we killed, it was in self defense. Besides, they can't touch us, Nobody knows anything, not even our experiments, only you and I. - I remember. Isabel and Eric, Isabel and you. - that's something you pulled from your subconscious. - She'll be safe with Eric. - So long as Eric is safe from you. - From me? You... Yes, I remember again. Kill Eric. what am I, alive or dead? Man or beast? what have you done to me? - I saved your life, I tell you, and I'll find a way to make you well. It was an accident. You understand? An accident! You fool, you madman, what have you done? - I'm sending this evil back into the darkness, - Ted, you're mad. You can't do this, - You're wrong, Doctor. There's nothing left of it now but you and me and this. And now I'm glad, because my work here is finished. I've, I've... - But you haven't finished yet, you know. There's just one more task, Eric. Get up. Remember, you must first kill Eric then yourself, Understand? First Eric then yourself, - First Eric then myself. First Eric then myself. Ted! Tod! Tod! Tod! Tod! - Nothing ghoulish looking about that guy to me, - You can never tell about these musicians. A lot of 'em are pretty queer ducks. # All the lovely things of life are made all for love # # All for love # # Every bough casts refreshing shade # # So that lovers vows may be expressed # - First Eric, then myself. - Ted. Ted. # I wandered far and long to find # # The reason why # # The reason why there's a world # # And the thing we call our soul # Ted. Ted, Ted, listen to me, Ted, you've gotta come with me now. We need each other now. - First Eric, then myself. Ted, we can't think of Eric now, only ourselves. - First Eric, then myself. - Ted, you've gotta help me. Ted, you've got to, Tod! # My darling, my own # # Let your arms enfold me # # Let them hold me # # We were meant for this and this # - First Eric, then myself - Miss Isabel Lewis. Miss Lewis, do you know who this man is? - Why... - Yes, she does, Officer. - How long have you known him, and what's this all about? - I can't toll you anything now, I can't even think. - Please, if you don't mind, Maybe this note will I explain. - Dearest Isabel, what you surmised about me this evening is true. Forgive me. It was Dr, Morris who involved me in all of those unspeakable crimes. I shall pass on knowing you and Eric will be happy together. I pray you will I forgive me for everything. Do you know who Dr. Morris is? - He was Tod's professor at school. - Officer, do you mind if Miss Lewis goes to her dressing room? It's been quite a shock, you know. She'll be very happy to answer all your questions later. - All right, but both of you stay there. I'll ho there shortly, - Ted. Ted. It's no use, Dr. Morris. I'm sending this evil back into the darkness, There's nothing left of it now but you and me and death.
