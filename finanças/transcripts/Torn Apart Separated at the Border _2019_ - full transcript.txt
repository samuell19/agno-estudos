"No one leaves home unless home is the mouth of a shark." Warsan Shire, poet In 2018, nearly 3 000 families were separated while seeking asylum at the U.S. border. This is the story of two of these families. I have put in place a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry on our southwest border. If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. If you smuggle illegal aliens across our border, then we will prosecute you. Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you. And that child may be separated from you as required by law. Maria has just been released from an ICE detention center in Texas. She has been separated from her son for 70 days. When I got to immigration, I thought it was all over. I thought my suffering would end. The men in green treated us very badly. They apprehended us with other Hondurans. "Do you know your kids will be taken away and you'll be detained ?" "Is that true, Mommy ?" "No, sweetie, it's only for a few days" "until we leave for our destination, while they gather all our information." They put us in a very cold room. I was just wearing this blouse without a sweater or anything else. I was shivering and crying. My child wept night and day. The next day they called my child and they took him away.

I saw how two of my mother's brothers were killed. My son's father was killed. My son was threatened and he'd come back home crying. I knew if I got him out of there, he'd have a better future. That's what forced me to leave, to protect my son. My son was sleeping with his shoes on because I knew they'd call his name soon. And so they took him away. Thank God he didn't see me getting handcuffed. Hands, waist, ankles, everything. They took us out at 3 AM. Then these officers poured a disinfectant on us as if we had lice. They made us strip in front of them. They put us in the showers. It was awful. This was after 10 days on the road, barely eating or sleeping. We knew nothing about our kids. All the mothers were crying. Because they took our children away and didn't care to tell us where they were. Maria's 10-year-old son Alex was taken over 2 100 miles away, to the Cayuga migrant children's shelter in New York. After 12 days we finally spoke and he didn't sound well. To anything I'd ask he'd answer: "Yes, mommy, no, mommy." That made my soul ache, because I knew he wasn't well. Four days. That's how much time the Trump Administration has to meet the court ordered deadline to reunite 2 500 migrant children with their parents, after the same administration ripped them from their families at the border. As of Friday, the government has returned only 450 children between the ages of 5 and 17 to their families. 2 000 kids are still separated from their parents. Vilma was detained after fleeing domestic abuse in Guatemala. She has been separated from her daughter for nearly 8 months. On July 26, when, supposedly, they were going to return the children, they took me out of Irwin. They flew me to Port Isabel, Texas. I was with 10 other women. I was wondering if I'd be reunited with my daughter. I kept waiting while everyone else was running to meet their kids. They never called me. They never told me if I'd be reunited with my daughter. Vilma's daughter Yeisvi was placed in a foster home over 2 000 miles away from her mother. My mommy was trying to figure out how we could come here because my daddy hit my mommy and I watched. I had to watch everything my daddy was doing to my mommy. One Friday he stripped me. I was left in my blouse. He took my skirt off. I was running in my underwear. He would hit me here. He would punch and kick me. He would put something burning in my eyes. He even took me to a place in the mountains to kill me because I didn't give him 5 paychecks. I was looking and my mom was crying. He took away my house keys. I was left on the street. My daddy locked the door. I wanted something to eat. But there was nothing. In Guatemala my life was very difficult. Police doesn't exist over there. If the police arrive, it's just to pick up dead bodies. A lot of women are killed. I didn't have anywhere to go with my baby. I also didn't have money to pay rent and my neighbors were afraid to let me stay with them. We couldn't live with our neighbor, so we came here. I was told: "Your daughter is from the U.S." "You can go there with her. You know how to work." Yeisvi was born in the U.S. 11 years ago, when Vilma and her husband came here as temporary farm workers. I borrowed money to come here. I came with a special person, so that nothing would happen to my daughter in Mexico, because it's hard to cross through Mexico. Children are kidnapped. I don't know how many days it took, but we finally crossed the bridge and we met a border agent. Vilma and Yeisvi crossed the border and Vilma's intention was to seek protection under U.S. law because of the violence that she faced in her home country. As soon as they encountered U.S. authorities, within 15 minutes she was told, "your daughter can't be here, your daughter's a U.S. citizen". The government cannot detain in immigration detention a U.S. citizen child. So they contacted the state of Arizona and immediately brought in some folks from the Child Protective System to take Yeisvi into state custody and put her into foster care. They took away my mommy and I cried. So your agency will be separating children from their parents ? No. What we'll be doing is prosecuting parents who have broken the law. Just as we do every day in the United States of America. I can appreciate that. But if that parent has a 4-year-old child, what do you plan on doing with that child ? The child, under law, goes to HHS for care and custody. They will be separated from their parent. Just like what we do in the United States every day. It was Christmas and my birthday, too and I'm sad because my mommy isn't with me. I wanted to talk to my daughter, but the officers wouldn't lend me a phone. A calling card costs 21 dollars in Irwin. I asked for a job. So I worked for 21 days earning 1 dollar a day. After 21 days I bought a calling card and managed to talk to my daughter. I was happy when I spoke to her. My mom told me: "Don't be sad," "be well behaved. I love you so much, Yeisvi." "Okay," I said. When we got Vilma's case, she had already been denied asylum by an immigration judge in Atlanta, and I should mention that that's not very rare. Only 2% of asylum claims in Atlanta are granted where in other courts it's 70%, 80%. There's been no showing that the respondent was targeted for harm. It is hereby ordered the respondent's application for asylum be denied and the respondent be deported to Guatemala. The judge said: "You don't have proof, documents, nothing." "Go back to your country." After Maria's release from detention, she will fly across the country to reunite with her son. - Hello ! - Isaias, how are you ? Good, good. What are you up to ? I arrive tomorrow. - You arrive tomorrow ? - Yes, tomorrow. The lawyer is doing everything possible to bring my boy the same day. I can't believe I'm free and will be there soon. I need someone to pinch me to see if this is real. I didn't sleep much. Every 30 minutes I checked the clock. I got up at 2 AM to get ready. I can't wait to see my son again. This bag has everything I own. I only carry the documents given to me when I was released and a Bible. I don't have anything. They took it all away. Thank goodness tomorrow I'll see my son. I'll be with him and be able to hug him again. And be able to ask him for forgiveness for our separation because those weren't my plans. Maria is greeted by friends from her hometown in Honduras. Kenia ! Hi ! Dear Isaias. blessings ! Thank you. - Are you happy ? - Yes, but where is my son ? But you made it here. That's what matters. That's what matters. - Hello ? - Lawyer ? - Hi, Maria, how are you ? - Good and how are you ? - Did you arrive ? - Yes, but I'm still missing my son. Yesterday I spoke with them. It looks like it might not be until Monday. I'm pushing to get him out as soon as possible. I keep reaching out to them, so they're aware of the situation. Maria, are you still there ? Yes. Are you okay ? I thought I wouldn't have to wait any longer. I know. I've struggled dealing with the social worker because he doesn't have kids and he's a man. Can you ask if we can pick him up tomorrow ? Of course. I've told him you are willing to pick him up. He already knows. Just like you have done your part working so hard he should come through to give me my son back. I'm going to keep trying, okay ? Of course, lawyer. I thank you with all my heart. My lawyer told me: "They will take your daughter away." "They won't give her back." Vilma had been detained for about 6 months at that time and the state of Arizona was in legal proceedings to deprive Vilma, permanently, of her custody over her daughter. At those proceedings, the only reason why Vilma's custody of her daughter was even a question was because she was detained and therefore was unable to take care of her daughter. Vilma was granted a new asylum hearing, but ICE refused to release her from detention. And I told my lawyer: "I'm going to fight for my life with my daughter." "That's why I need to keep going." When we submitted a humanitarian parole petition to ICE, they denied that with no rationale other than "she is an extreme flight risk". She's not a flight risk because, first of all, she has an asylum claim that she wants to pursue in court here. She has a U.S. citizen daughter whom she wants to raise in the United States where she can be safe. So we filed litigation in multiple jurisdictions. We ultimately ended up pursuing a media strategy. Right now, there is a growing call for the U.S. government to reunite a mother and daughter who have not seen each other for more than 7 months. ICE is the organization that controls her detention center. We can call on our politicians and demand that Vilma be reunited with her daughter. My mind was all over the place. It was really sad. Since you arrived and you were separated, how have you felt ? This was my worst nightmare. Honestly I've blocked it out of my life. All I care about is getting my son back to know that my life is complete again. Maria had to wait 3 days before she could pick up her son, Alex. Mr. Diego. We're here, but can't find parking. Can you bring out my boy ? My love. Such joy to be with mommy again. Did you miss me ? Of course, me too ! I kept asking: "When will I see my son again ?" It felt like an eternity, my love. Every day felt like a year. Are you happy, my love ? Come here, baby ! I missed you so much ! I thought I'd never get to see you play again, my love. We are together again. They won't separate us. No more. When you are older, it'll be different. But while you are still a kid, I'll be with you. Even when I'm big, I want to be with you. We're not going to be separated again. I want to go to my new home. How many days were you in there ? I was there for 60 something days. Did you cry when your mom called ? But why ? I cried every time my mom called. What were you feeling, love ? That they were going to separate us forever. That's impossible. I would have gone to the ends of the world. No, son. Kenia, Kenneth, Ariana and I are your family. We don't see you as a burden. It's a blessing to be together. I believe it's a gift that you are with us. You are welcomed. Can I give you a hug ? - Welcome. - Thank you. You have to be good. And get up early to go to school. Look, darling. Smell it and see if you like it. - I'm going to put some on too. - Yes, you can also wear some. Spray it on your arm to see if you like it. I'd like a photo. It smells good. To send to Aunt Leidy. The guard said: "Vilma, you'll be released." "You are going to see your baby. " I said: "My baby ?" He said: "Yes !" They took me to the airport in Atlanta. After 246 days, Vilma was unexpectedly released from ICE detention in Georgia. She had to travel to Arizona, where her daughter was in foster care. - Welcome ! - Hello ! The custody case against Vilma was dropped when she was released. I couldn't believe the news when my lawyer told me yesterday. I said: "My God, is that true ?" Because I've been asking God to stay in the U.S. and save my daughter's life. Don't cry, my love, I'm with you now. I'm never going to leave you. You are safe now, my love. We're not going back to Guatemala. I swear, I won't let anything bad happen to you Yes, my love. Thank God we're alive and well. I'll never leave you. Are you going to be happy with me ? Can you forgive me ? I don't want you to go back to Guatemala. No, my love, don't worry. I won't go back to Guatemala. Look ! Santa Claus gave you earrings ! I got them because my ears are pierced now. You didn't have them pierced. You didn't speak very well back home. Now teach me English. You'll have to teach me, because you're the one going to school. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Just that for now. I'm finally happy with my mommy. You're happy with your mommy. A local family volunteers to host Vilma and Yeisvi temporarily. I can get down by myself, mommy. I still think you're little. - Welcome ! - Thank you for everything. - You're welcome. - Thank you, you saved me. - Welcome ! - Thank you. - Welcome ! - Come on in. - Thank you. - Welcome. Thank you. What a beautiful house. Don't cry, my love. Don't cry, don't cry, my love. I'm with you now. Don't cry. - Say thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you. I love only you, my Lord. I love only you, my Lord. I love only you, my Lord. And never look back. - Are you happy ? - Yes. - You want me here with you ? - Yes. - I love you very much. - Me too. - Tea for Princess Yeisvi. - Thank you. My daughter was very traumatized in Guatemala. Back there she didn't know how to speak well. - Hi ! - Hi ! How are you ? I'm good, my friend. I spoke, but only a little bit. Because I was seeing what was happening to my mommy, so my head hurt in Guatemala. Now my head doesn't hurt because I'm here. Vilma, my parents are immigrants too. My mom fled her country a long time ago. That's good. Thank you for helping us. Vilma, I could never imagine being away from Elika for 8 months. It was very difficult to be incarcerated. Many kids were left without their parents. You're a very strong woman. Very strong. Vilma, your spirit is of a warrior. You're an inspiration. Always. Thank you. Let's eat, love. It's time for breakfast. Mom, what will happen with the lawyers today ? I don't know, my love. We're just going to introduce ourselves so he can start working on the case. We'll see what happens. Anything he asks you know why we are here. Always answer with the truth. Let's go. It's so cold ! It's unbelievably cold. What worries me is how this has affected my son. I think he's been through a lot. Maybe it's not visible. But emotionally, in his heart, what effect did this experience have at his young age ? It was worth it to come here because here I'll be safe. Back home, no one does anything if two kids get into a fight. Some kids killed each other fighting. I'm proud that I was able to get him out at a young age. Look, this was the day we left. Do you remember ? I took this picture with your cousins. Look, my dad's party ! When we took a photo of him with all the kids. It was his birthday. And this one ? My dad ! You were so tiny. If Alex's dad hadn't been killed, I would've stayed there. I had no reason to flee. I don't know if I'll be able to return one day. Will I be granted asylum or not ? What if I don't get it ? Where will I go ? It's really hard. But my son is my hope and my strength. I've learned that life has good and bad things. And that life is different from what we imagine it to be. I've achieved my dreams by giving my son a better option. That compensates for all the pain and sadness. Now 24 times 18. Write your numbers clearly. My dream is to see him succeed here. I'm going to fight until I see this with my own eyes. Vilma moved to rural Georgia to stay with her brother's family. Georgia has one of the highest asylum denial rates in the country. They're all also getting ready. You have to be good in school. You have to pay attention so you learn. Be smart. All right. My brother will be like a father to my daughter. Because he loves my daughter and my daughter loves him too. - All set, kids ? - Yes. Let's pray. Dear Lord, thank you for this beautiful morning. Thank you for your love. Thank you for being kind. I entrust Sharon, Emanuel and Yeisvi in your hands. Help them, Lord, to stay on a good path. Amen. Okay, you can get out. I see that my daughter needs a psychologist, because she's always thinking about what we went through when I was imprisoned, when we were separated. I think she's going to be taken away and I don't want to be left alone here. Because my mommy is now with me and I'm always thinking she's going to be taken away. I feel a lot of pain for her. I tell her to be patient. It's how life is in this country. Mommy. Alright, I'll quiz you. How do you say lunes in English ? - Monday. - Martes ? Tuesday ? To be honest, I'm scared of returning to Guatemala. My husband is still after me. He threatened my mother. I hope God will touch ICE's heart, so I'm given permission to stay in this country. That's what worries me especially because of my next court date. I hope I can get a place just for me and my daughter so she doesn't suffer anymore, to keep my daughter away from harm. Because it's for the love of my daughter that I'm here. In 2018, the U.S. granted asylum in 35% of cases. This is a decrease from 58% in 2012. Vilma and Maria both await asylum hearings. Families detained at the border in 2018 were separated for an average of 3 months and some have yet to be reunited. Subtitles from . :: Register ::.
