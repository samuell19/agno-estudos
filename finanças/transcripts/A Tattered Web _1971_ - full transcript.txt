Would you believe it? It's dark already. I'm late. I'll see you, honey. Hey. Hey. I'm not gonna let you go. Let me go. I'm not gonna let you. See you tomorrow, then. [phone ringing] Hello. Louise Campbell? LOUISE [ON PHONE]: Yeah. Stay away from that young guy. What? Hey, who is this, anyway? Never mind. Just do what I say. Stay away from him, you understand? Stay away from him. Who is this? Hello? Hello? [SINGING]: For She's a jolly good fellow, for she's a jolly good fellow, that nobody can deny. Now, blow 'em out! Blow 'em out. OK, OK, I'll try. Make a wish. I didn't think I could do it. There were so many of them. Come on. You're only 23, Tina. Wait till you're 45. 46. Oh, if you weren't wearing that gun, Joe Marcus. Oh, but I am, sweetie. Hey, Steve, what kind of friends does your wife have? Oh, they're killers, every single one of them. Right ,honey? Right. Whoops, look and learn, sweetie. Married almost a year, and still smooching in public. Shut up. You live with father-in-law, you don't have much choice. Right? Selma, why don't you serve the coffee? I'll cut the cake when my dad comes. Sure, honey. Where's the old bear, anyway? Probably out on a job, you know what I mean? Oh, now come, on. Don't joke about it, please. Come on, funny man. All right, all right. I worry about him, Steve. I can't help it. Worry about me. You know what I wish for? I wish you and my dad would get along better. We will, soon as you and I move outta here. Steve, I don't see what difference it makes. Daddy! Oh. We've been waiting for you. Working later, huh, Ed? I'm sorry, baby. Been out. That's OK. You're here now. Well, let's cut the cake. Listen, everybody, we can cut the cake now. I've been wondering where you were, you big lug. OK, everybody, here we go. I can't wait. Mmm! Steve-O, you wanna go bowling tonight? No, I'm taking Tina to a movie. Oh yeah, her old man just called a few minutes ago. He wants you to stop by before you go home. Same old junk. You wouldn't have any of that birthday cake, would you? Hmm? You got any of that birthday cake? Here, you can have it. Oh, I don't want it all. I said you can have it! Sgt. Stagg around? Hi, Steve. He's inside. Is it important? Beats me. I guess I better hang around. Do you know Sgt. Stagg? Yeah, I know him. He arrested my son. Says he stole a car. I don't believe it. He's never been in trouble before. Well, he's in trouble now, Mister. -Joe. -Oh, Sergeant. Tell those other kids to be released, will you? I don't wanna hold 'em any longer than we have to. -Sure. -You get a lawyer? -Yes, I have a lawyer. -Get a hold of him. Your boy'll be arraigned in a couple of hours. Come on inside. Sergeant, you are making a mistake. Yeah, I wish I were. But he's only 17. He's-- he's on the honor school roll at school. And he snatched somebody's car, went for a joyride, and wrecked it. Now, look, Mr. Hamlin, if you want your kid to think that he can break the law and get away with it, that's your business. But don't ask me to hold your hand. Come on. Sergeant, don't you understand-- Call your lawyer. sit down. Pretty rough on that poor guy, weren't you? What are you talking about? It's not my fault he didn't teach his kid to respect the law. Now go ahead. Sit down. A guy doesn't know the difference between right and wrong, he might as well be living in a tree. You agree? What's this all about, huh? Tina. Do you love her? Huh? I asked you a question. Do you love her? Sure, I love her. She ever tell you about her mother? No. No, she ran out on us, both of us, when Tina was only 10. Tina is all I've got-- all. Don't I know it. How many times you been in that dame's apartment? What dame? You know what this would do to Tina if she found out about it. Found out about what, Sergeant? I don't know what you're talking about. You know damn well what I'm talking about. It's been in my gut for a week now. Louise Campbell, that's the one I'm talking about. Now, how many times? Once, twice, seven, 20-- how many times? [thud] How many? You think that I'm some punk you pulled in off the street? Don't smart with me. I know you've been seeing this Campbell dame, and I want it stopped-- now. I'll think about it, Sergeant. Damn right, you'll think about it. You will do it. That's what you'll do. You'll do it! I'm not gonna let my Tina be hurt. In my book, she comes ahead of everybody-- you, me, everybody. Then why don't you let her go? Everything, she still comes running to you for everything. We've been married for almost a year, and I still don't know whose wife she is, yours or mine. What kind of a question-- You know how many times I've pleaded with her to move out of that house of yours? She thinks we can't manage without Papa. Well, let me tell you something, Sergeant. I can manage without Papa. You stay away from that dame, you hear? You hear me? Stay away from her! Hi, Dad. Hello, baby. When you knit, remember. Picked up a couple of ticket for the doubleheader this Sunday. I thought you didn't like baseball. Well, Steve does. Figured you and he might wanna get away from your old man for a while. Daddy, you're sweet. Ah, not yet, but I'm working on it. Hey, I thought you two were going to the movies tonight. We didn't. If you're hungry, we have piles of cold chicken in the refrigerator. Sweetheart, you and Steve, you-- you having any trouble? What trouble? Am I keeping you from moving out of here? Huh? Sweetheart, because if I am-- Hey, how does this look so far? Do you think Steve'll like it? He better. Where is he? Home, isn't he? Nope. I'll go and fix you that chicken. Half to 10:00. Well, he had to work late again tonight. He phoned me. Some kind of emergency. Daddy, I wish you'd talk to him about working late so much. Do you want to hear something funny? Hmm? I worry about him all the time. Even at night, sometimes I wake up and I look at him, just to see if he's breathing. Isn't that weird? No. No, not if you love him that much. Don't you dare tell him about this. He'll think I'm crazy or something. OK? Cold chicken coming up. This is crazy. How do I get her out of there? Keep it cool. Yeah, thanks. Thanks for listening. Any time. [knocking on door] W-- oh. I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else. May I come in, Miss Campbell? What do you want? It won't take long. Hey, just a minute. Who do you think you are? You got no right coming in here. Look who's talking about right. What is this? What do you want? My name is Stagg, Sergeant Edward Stagg. Does that mean anything to you? Oh, are you gonna bust me, Sergeant? Well, look, if you don't have a warrant, I'd like you to leave. Steve Butler is my son-in-law. Oh. Oh, I see. Well, look, Sergeant, it's 10:30. It is a little late for a social call. I don't place social calls on tramps. Get outta here. Go on. Get. You want me outta here, you better listen. You and Steve have had it. It's finished. You-- you were the one on the telephone. Man, some cop. You're gonna have to get somebody else to pay your bills. That shouldn't be too hard. There's a guy on every street corner just dying to get someone like you. How much do you want? Click, click, right and wrong, nothing in between. Man, Steve sure had you pegged. I don't want anything, Sergeant. I just wanna turn around and get outta here. My daughter doesn't know anything about you and Steve, and she's not going to know. Now, how much. Go on home, Sergeant. I'm tired and going to bed. It's over, you understand? It's over. The next time he calls, you tell him you've had it. You never wanna see him again-- never. Look, Sergeant, don't try to run my life, not my life. Now, you listen to me, you no-good little-- Go on. Get outta here! My daughter! You are not going to hurt my daughter. Is that clear? You are not going to hurt her. There's only one person hurting that kid of yours, and it's not me. What do you mean? Well, who do you think's running Steve out of your house? Me? You shut up. You shut up. Oh, you think Steve's coming over here because he's crazy in love with me? Well, I'm not that lucky, Sergeant. I just happened to be-- Don't you point that finger at me! If anyone is lousing up their lives, it's you, man, you! I told you to shut up, didn't I? Sorry. Sorry, I-- I didn't mean to hurt you, but you-- Miss Campbell, hey, hey. Come on. Drink this now. Come on. Drink. Oh my god. My god. MAN [ON PHONE]: Police headquarters. I wanna report-- I wanna-- MAN [ON PHONE]: You'll have to speak up, Mister. I can't hear you. Hello? Hello? Hello? Last piece. I was saving it for Dad, but it's his loss. I wonder where he went. He's a big boy now, Tina. Hey, you know what I was thinking? What? The last time we were on a roller coaster was our first date. Why don't we go this Saturday? I saw him today. He told me about your mother. Why should he do that? He never talks about her. He did today. Steve, it was awful. I never heard a grown man cry before. I can still hear it some time. It was 13 years ago. He's not crying anymore. Steve. Steve, I love you. Tina. I love you so much. Tina, there's something I wanna tell you. Just tell me you love me. That's all I wanna hear. You know I do. Let's do it, Steve. Lets make me believe it's our first date all over again. We'll eat cotton candy, and throw baseballs, and buy popcorn. I can't catch up with you. You're like a little kid. Well, it's better than being serious and grumpy, like some people I know. You're a character. [doorknob turns] Daddy? Daddy? Daddy, guess what. Steve and I are going on a roller coaster this Saturday. What's wrong? I have that cold chicken, if you want it. I'm not hungry. Are you sure? It's only-- I said I'm not hungry! Take care of your husband. Leave me alone. Steve, what's the matter with him? Stay out of it. Hey. Sergeant, why take it out on her? You can be sore with me, OK, but-- listen, I'm trying to tell you something. You're right about one thing. I don't want Tina to be hurt, either. Why'd you have to mess around with that dame for, anyway, Steve? I said you were right, didn't I? It's all over. I'm not gonna see her anymore. I'm wrapping it up. I'm gonna level with Tina right now. I'm gonna tell her all about it. No, you're not. You're not gonna tell her anything, not one word, not one word about you and that tramp. Is that clear? -Now, wait a minute, Sergeant. -No,no. Don't argue with me. She couldn't take it. She'd fall apart. It's not the end of the world. But it would be for her! You don't know her like I do. We've got to protect her. We have to, you and me. We can't let anything tie you in with that tramp-- nothing! OK. If you say so. Yes, I do. I do. We have to protect her. We have to. It's all I try to do, just-- just trying to protect her, trying to protect her. [phone ringing] I got it. Police headquarters. Sergeant Marcus. What? Just a minute. Go ahead. Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. OK, I got it. We'll get right on it. Who was that? Hold up. Hey, Mike. Just write all this, will you? Grocery store on 5th Street. OK, Pop. Right here. Sit down. Now, he says he killed his best friend. Oh. When this happen, Pop? I-- I dunno. Two, three, four days. I-- I don't remember. MARTIN: How'd you kill him? I dunno. What's your friend's name, Pop? What's your name? Put him away. Let him sleep it off. We'll talk more later. OK, let's go, Pop. Hey, hey. All right. Easy now. Easy, you'll get a nice, long snooze. Easy now. Gonna be one of those days. Drunks looking for a place to sleep, a fight with my wife. Hey, Ed, you ever get married again, stay away from women who like to buy hats by the pound. Joe, check this out, will you? It's a cleaning woman on Williams Street. JOE: What's the pitch? She was a little hysterical. I didn't get very much. She said she'd found this girl that she works for stretched out on her couch. It might be a homicide. Getting right on it. Ed, you better go with him. In case it is a homicide, I'd like to have it cleaned up quick. Yes, sir. And then I-- I shook her, Sergeant. I-- I thought she was asleep or something. But she was cold. I mean, really cold. And then I thought the blood. And, well, I was so scared. I didn't know what to do. And that's when I called the police. Hey, Ed. Ed. Blood. Looks like an accident, huh? Maybe she got dizzy and fell down, hit her head. How did she get to the couch? Oh, I guess she got up somehow and managed to reach that before she passed out. What about it, Doc? Not a chance. She died a few seconds after she received the blow on the head. What about time? Oh, at least 10 hours, maybe more, I'll tell you after the autopsy. Oh, Sergeant, the only way she got on that couch was if someone put her there. Mrs. Simmons, did you move Miss Campbell's body? No, sir. I-- I-- I told the Sergeant. I came in here, and I found her lying on the couch. OK, OK, ma'am. OK You through with her, Red? ED: Yeah. You can go now, Mrs. Simmons. We'll call you again if we need you. Probably find her prints all over the place. The way I figure it, Ed, she could have had an argument with somebody. He knocked her down. She hit her head. He got scared. So he picked her up, carried her over to the couch. Probably didn't even know she was dead. Maybe even tried to pull her out of it. This might give us a nice set of prints. Well, what do you think? Sound logical? Yeah, yeah. It-- it makes sense. Sergeant, this guy outside lives upstairs. He said he saw someone hanging around the door last night. Check him out, will you, Ed? I wanna find out what's holding up fingerprint. I didn't see his face. It's always so dark out here at night you could break a leg, anyway. He was a man about, well, about your size, Sergeant. That's all I know. Then, you wouldn't recognize him if you saw him again, huh? No, but he wasn't a young fella. I mean, that much I can tell you. What young fella? Well, the one she went out with. I mean, him I saw lots of times. Do you know his name Uh, no. What's he look like? Well, a dame like that, she must have gone out with a trainload of guys. Maybe. But that's the only one we know about so far. What's he look like? Young, about 30 years old, tall, good-looking. Oh, he always looked mad, Sergeant. I'd give him a hello, and he never smiled, not once. Do you think he killed her? Well, that's what we're here to find out. Come on, Ed. You check the dresser. I'll tackle the desk. Maybe we'll come up lucky, something with his name on it, maybe even a picture. What about fingerprint. They haven't been here yet, have they? So? Be careful. Why don't we come back here later? Give fingerprint a chance to their job first. in the meantime, we can check out that place where she used to work on 10st, huh? Does that make more sense to you? OK. Go. -Yeah. I told her she was gonna get in trouble, going out with that guy. Those married men and all that. You know what I mean? You know his name? Uh-huh. Never met him. He was some kind of a working stiff. Docks, oil fields, something like that. What about other guys? She went out with other guys, didn't she? She only Went with one man at a time, Sergeant. This month, it was strictly him. You know if she saw him last night? Yeah, he called a little after 6:00. She said he was real sore at her. Wanted to see her right away. They were to meet at this restaurant, the Red War. You know it? Yeah. Poor kid. She was a sucker for a sad story. Any guy who was in trouble had it made. What kind of trouble was he in? Something with his father-in-law. Seems that the old man wanted everything is own way. Real character, Louise said. Maybe his way was the right way. Who knows? You show me a guy who's right all the time. There's no such animal. Well, thanks. We might as well check that restaurant. Yeah, you go ahead. I just thought of a couple more questions I'd like to ask that character. Waste of time, Ed. Take my car. I'll grab a car. You'd be better off coming with me. Listen, I've been on the force for over 25 years. I oughta know what I'm doing by now, shouldn't I? Good luck. Taxi! Sergeant. -How long you been on the force? -Three years. And you haven't heard about not smoking on duty? Sergeant, no one was here, and I thought-- You're here, aren't you? And you're in uniform. Now, put it out. Anybody here besides those ambulance guys? Only fingerprint, Sergeant. He left about five minutes ago. What'd you find, Jim? You don't say? Well, we gotta hit the jackpot sometime. Maybe we'll wrap this one up with a confession, huh? Right. Who was that? Remember that old bum walked in this morning? Said he killed his best friend? Yeah. He did. Now, you'd never think an old boozehound like that would have that much conscience, would you? You dig up anything? Uh, went back to her apartment, checked it out thoroughly. Didn't find a thing. Ed, did you kill her? What kind of a joke is that? Some hotshot detective. I've been on the force more than 25 years. I know what I'm doing. Hey, remember this? Know whose prints were on it? Yours, you clumsy jerk! What do you want? A confession? JOE: What I wanna know is when you put your big paws all over it. I dunno, when you were talking to the doctor, I guess. Handling evidence like a wet-nosed rookie. And I always thought you were the perfect cop. So I goofed up. It happens. What about that-- that so-called boyfriend of hers? You find anything? Sure did. He was with her last night. In her apartment? No, at the restaurant. A waiter there remembered. The description fits. We'll pick him up. But you don't know that he went to her apartment, do you? Well, it figures, doesn't it? he's married. The guy at the diner said he was sore when he called her. Chances are, his wife was making waves, so they had to break it up. So they had dinner, went back to her apartment, had a few choice words. She landed on her head. How can you be so sure that we'll be able to pick him up. We know where he works-- docks or oil fields. There could be a thousand guys. Only one looks like this. Steve, I'm in here. Hi. Hi. Is your father home yet? No. Rough day, huh? Yeah. I had a rough day. You know what I decided? I'm gonna start an organic vegetable garden in the backyard. We're going to have carrots, and radishes, and tomatoes. How does that sound? That sounds fine. Sounds fine? You're the only farmer I know, and all you can say is, "sounds fine." Hey, babe, I'm just not with it today. I'm counting on you for advice. Well, I'm no farmer. You were born on one. Yeah, and my parents lost it when I was five. So? You've got five years more experience than I do. You're too much, you know that? OK, just wait and see. We're going to have tomatoes. That big. Not if I get near 'em. Steve, I've-- I'm thinking. Maybe you were right. Maybe we should go away for a while, just you and me. What brought that on? Well, that's what you wanted, isn't it? They owe you a vacation. Maybe we can even leave tomorrow. Walk out on my job, just like that? Walk out on my job? Why not? It's been than being unhappy all the time. Oh, Steve, I just-- I just want us to love each other. And live happily ever after like in the story books. Yeah, I know. Well, it doesn't happen. Forget it. Why shouldn't it? Because I'm just a guy! That's all. Take a look at me. I'm just a guy. I-- I don't have a suit of armor. I don't have a white horse. I wouldn't know how to fight a dragon if I saw one. I'm just a guy. That's all! I do stupid things. I make mistakes. Sergeant I wanna talk to you. Outside. You say anything to Tina? I didn't kill her, Sergeant. Believe me. What about Tina? Did you say anything to her? No, not yet. Well, see that you keep it that way. What good'll it do? They have that sketch. Sooner or later, they'll pin it down and run me in. Not if you keep your mouth shut. Here. Found that in her apartment. Maybe you wanna put in your scrapbook. Look, Sergeant. I'm sorry you found out this. Just keep your mouth shut. That's all I ask. I didn't kill her. All right. I didn't see her that night. Believe me, that's the truth. Oh, that's the truth, huh? Sergeant, listen, I know you wouldn't cover for me if you thought I was guilty-- Can't you-- can't you just leave it alone! Sure I used to date her, but I haven't seen her in like two months. How about the night was killed? But I told you-- Tell me again. The movies. I went to the movies. I wasn't anywhere near her place. OK, you can go. Well, go on. Get outta here. Like fishing in a mudhole. Nothing. The Lieutenant just had a call, Ed. The girl's father. He got a letter from her the day before she died. She mentioned her boyfriend's name-- Steve. That's right, Ed. Narrows it down, doesn't it? How funny, Joe. Look, Ed. Y-- you and me, we've been friends a long time. I mean, I've known Tina since she was that high. So? How were she and Steve getting along? Fine, fine. They get along fine. Ed, I was here. I was right here when you and Steve-- he came tearing out of that room like he was chasing somebody. I heard you yell at him, Ed, stay away from that dame! I heard it. Look, Ed, he's married. He works in the oil fields. He coulda posed for that sketch! Yeah, and his father-in-law tries to run his life. Don't forget that. His father-in-law is an honest cop who once said he'd walk out the day he found himself trying to protect a guilty man. It wasn't him, Joe! I know it wasn't him. He was working that night. You're sure of that, Ed? Yes, I'm sure of it. I don't cover for murderers. OK. OK, Ed. One suspect. That's all, just one suspect, and you think you've got it made. Well, this town is full of people who might have killed her. Like who? -I can't do it. -You must. You've got to. I know Joe Marcus. He's gonna pull you in. -It's crazy. -You want him to pick you up? You want Tina to find out about you and that dame? Somebody killed Louise, not me. Let him run, not me. I know, I know. Take Tina with you. I'll talk to her. She'll listen to me. No! She won't be able to take it, I tell you. It'll destroy her. -Help her. Help me. That's what I'm trying to do. Not this way, not by running. How do you think our lie sounded to Louise in the first place? I couldn't lick a problem so I ran. How can I expect Tina to grow up if I won't? But it's the only chance you've got. You wanna help me? Really help me? Help me get your Marcus off my back? There's only one way. I didn't kill Louise. Find the man who did. Then, you won't leave? No. Winos, hopheads, bums. I mean, a hundred times I talked to the landlord about it. Someday, I'll break a leg just stepping over 'em. The man you saw hanging around this door that night, could he have been a wino? Maybe, why not? Could he have been about 65, 70 years old? Oh, did you find somebody, Sergeant? Could he have been that old? I suppose. Yeah, yeah, sure he could. Ah, thanks. Hello, Willard. I'm Sergeant Stagg. Yes, sir. Here, take a look at that. Take it out of the bag. Quick. That's it. You ever seen that before? Turn it all around. Get a good look at it. That's it. Hey, you ever drink that kind of wine? Yeah, if it was cheap enough. Hey, let's put it back now, huh? Put it in the bag. That's good. How old are you, Pop? I-- I dunno. 65, 67. I don't remember good no more. ED: You have any relatives, friends? No. No, relatives. Friends, friends. Len Blackguard. He's my best friend. Oh. No, he's dead, Pop. He's the man you killed. Oh yeah. Oh my god. I-- I forgot. Yeah, Len-- Len and me had-- had a fight. I-- I hit him with something. Piece of lead pipe. Yeah. Piece of lead pipe. What did you hit the girl with, Pop? Girl? I-- I-- I don't remember no good. Come on now. You've already admitted the one murder. Why not admit the other one? Why not get that girl off your conscience too, huh? You're gonna get the gas chamber, anyway. They can only gas you once, right, Pop? Ho-- honest. I don't remember no girl. The night before you turned yourself in, where were you? I-- I don't know. I-- I don't. I don't know. I-- I don't remember. ED: Why not? Why don't you remember? I-- I told-- I told it. Like, I told him already. I was drunk. You were drunk all right, but not too drunk to remember what you did. Now, what did you do? You didn't tell them everything, did you? I thought I did. You tell 'em that you forced your way into Louise Campbell's apartment? You tell 'em that? Hm? You tell 'em how you tried to take her money? [mumbling] Did you tell 'em how you knocked her down and killed her? I-- I didn't. I didn't. Come on now, Pop. You were so plastered you don't know what you did. Williams Street. You know Williams Street, don't you? -Yeah. -All right. That's better. 726 Williams Street, ground floor apartment. No, I-- I don't-- [mumbling] I'm sure I wasn't there. How come we're got a witness who saw you there, then, huh? How come I found this bottle In the hallway with your fingerprints all over it? Pop, Pop, I'm your friend. Huh? I wanna help you. I wanna help you remember, Pop. Now, come on. Pop. Why? Why would I kill her? For money. You needed money to buy wine. I-- I-- I wouldn't have killed her. Killed your friend, didn't you? Your best friend, only friend? Why wouldn't you kill her? You killed her, Pop. I don't know. I don't remember. I don't. Pop, you're gonna remember if I have to stay here all night. Oh, come on. Let me alone. Let me alone! No, no, Pop. No. I'm gonna help you, Pop. I'm gonna help you remember. Now, you were in the hallway, right? I-- yeah, I guess I was. Yes. Yes, you were. You were in the hallway, and it was 10:45 at night. You remember that now. 10:45. You knocked on the door, and when she opened it-- when she opened it, you pushed your way in. Please, Sergeant. You pushed your way in, and you asked her for some money. And when she didn't give it to you, you knocked her d-- you knocked her down, and you killed her. No, I-- I didn't You killed her, just like you killed your friend. I don't remember. And you killed her, Pop, and you know it! Then you-- then you dragged her body over to the couch, and you left her there. I was drunk. I wouldn't have done it if I wasn't drunk. It's all right, Pop. It's all right now. It's all right. All right. You don't have to remember everything now. Just remember that you killed her. I was drunk. You only die once. Do you understand that? You only die once! All right, Willard. How did you get into the apartment? The Lieutenant asked you a question. I-- I was drunk. How did you get into the apartment? I-- she-- she let me in, I guess. You guess? Aren't you sure? Told Sergeant Stagg that she opened the door and you pushed your way in. Is that what happened? Well, I-- I was drunk. Is that what happened, Pop? Yeah. What time was that? Time? Yeah, time? 9:30, 10:00, 10:30, 11:00? What time were you there? It was-- I-- I don't know. I-- maybe-- maybe 10 o'clock. 10 o'clock? You're answering the questions, Willard. 10 o'clock. All right, 10 o'clock. Why don't you tell us the rest of the story now? The rest of the story? Yeah, the rest of the story. You know you're gonna feel better if you get it off your mind. Didn't you feel better when you told us about killing your friend? Money. I must have asked her for money. I-- I don't remember. But you do know that you were there at 10 o'clock? Hey, I guess maybe I hit her. Probably. Please, I don't remember. Be right back. All right, Willard. Come on, sit up. Sit up. I want you to start again, right at the beginning, huh? What's your trouble, Ed? Are you bleeding for him? You? He's a murderer, isn't he? You think he did it? You're asking me? You're the one who found the bottle with his prints on it. You're the one who broke him down. You did a good job on him, Ed. Yeah. Yeah, it's great what you can do with 25 years of experience. Look, Ed, you've been pushing pretty hard. Why don't you take a couple of days sick leave? I'm OK. I'm OK. Go ahead. I'll square it with the Lieutenant. Hey, Steve. Steve-O baby, have you seen this guy who's the killer, huh? Looks just like enough to be your twin brother. Why don't you cool it. Oh now, come on, killer, I can't help it if you look like the mystery man. I told you to cool it! Well, you know, Killer, if you'd gone bowling with us last night, you'd have a perfect alibi. Of course, you now, you got relatives on the force. Now, don't worry. They'll take care of you. Hey! I got you off the hook. You looked just like your mother there, for a moment. Has anything happened? No. No, I was just tired. That's all. Just tired. Is it Steve? I almost killed my father once, did I ever tell you? He was drunk. He was beating up my mother. I was only 15. I ran away from home right after that. Didn't come back for three years. She was dead. I never saw him again, either. That's terrible. Funny. Haven't thought about him for years. Daddy, you're the best man that ever lived. Baby, promise me. Promise me that you'll never stop loving me. Daddy, don't-- Promise me. Look, everything I've done, it's been for you, everything. Promise me now, you'll always love me, always? Of course I will. Oh, baby. Thank you. Daddy, please tell me. Has anything happened to Steve? No. No, Steve-- Steve is fine. Yeah, he's fine. There was a hammer in the kitchen. I picked it up, and I hit him. I hit him. I hit him till he fell. And my mother screamed at me to get out of there. I was trying to help her. And she told me to get out. Yeah. Yes, I am tired. I think I'll-- I think I'll lie down for a while. Oh! Steve, are you crazy? Sure, I'm crazy. I'm flying, Tina! Steve, what happened to your face? Must have ran into a window. Oh, Steve, come on, be serious. Oh, Tina, that's for Steve, huh? That's for your father, who is absolutely the greatest, absolutely. Are you drunk? Have you been in a fight? Wait till you see the other guy. Go on. Change your clothes. We're going out. You gotta be kidding. No. It's a celebration. For freedom. Freedom. Celebration complete with hot dog, popcorn, cotton candy, the works. Go on. Change your clothes! Nothing. No. A little popcorn, a little cotton candy. Look at that guy. You see that guy back there? Look at him. Weak! Look at you. Hey, lady. You want some popcorn? No, I'd burst! Chicken, chicken. Get two. Hey, Mister, take good care of him. Two big ones. Lots of butter. Thanks. You see this? Did you see it? Sergeant, it says that old man was in Louise's apartment at 10 o'clock. That's a mistake, isn't it? You're off the hook, so forget about it. Did he say that? At 10 o'clock? He said that he killed her, that he was drunk, that he forced his way into her apartment. And that he killed her at 10 o'clock. Did he said that? What difference does it make? You got Joe Marcus off your back now! So do what I said. Forget about. It's wrong, Sergeant. What's wrong? He couldn't have been there at 10 o'clock, Sergeant. I lied to you, Sergeant. I wasn't working that night. I was with Louise. We had dinner. I went to her apartment. I stayed there until 10:30. 10:30, Sergeant. I was scared, If I wasn't, I wouldn't have lied! No, you didn't lie to me. You didn't see her that night. You were working that night. He couldn't have been there at 10 o'clock. I know! -You know. I'll tell you what you know! You were married to my daughter, and you messed around with the tramp! She got killed! That's what you know. But it's true, Sergeant. I was there! You gotta call headquarters and tell him! I don't have to tell 'em anything, and neither do you! I'll tell 'em myself. No! No, what about Tina? -Tina? That old man is sitting in a cell because of a story that isn't true, and you're worried about Tina. All right, all right. Forget about Tina. What about you? What about yourself? They'll say you killed her. -So they'll say I killed her. I didn't. And neither did that old man. Please, you don't realize what you're doing. One of us does, and I'm gonna call 'em. No, you won't have to. We're going out in the car. I'll drive you there myself. Where'd you find him? Blockhouse. He said he was with the old man that night. Passed out about 9 o'clock. Didn't wake up till 3:00 in the morning. 10th Street, a good 12 blocks from the girl's apartment. You buy it? Yeah. I buy it. OK. What about the bottle with his prints on it? They could've been there for a week, or it could have been planted. We've got a confession, Joe. No, no. Not us. We didn't get that confession. We didn't get anything. Sarge, headquarters is over there. I know. We'll get there. I wanna talk. We said it all. We said nothing! Nothing. Well, of course we have trouble. Oh, he stays up late every night, and runs around with wild women, and beats me every time he comes home. Tina, where's your father? Maybe with Steve drunk, rolling in the gutter. It happens every night of the week. Is your father with him? Hey, isn't he cute? We won him at a shooting gallery. Tina, where are they? I don't know. I don't- I don't know where anybody is. Well, where should I put you? Tina, did you ever hear of a girl named Louise Campbell? Should I? She was murdered. It's been in the papers for days. Oh. Oh. Yeah, I never read the papers. Your father's been working on the case. Here, now, then, this is where you belong. Tina, he's in trouble, serious trouble. I don't believe that. He's a good cop, too good to louse up an investigation by handling a piece of evidence. Tina, I bought it, but I can't buy it now. What evidence? What are you talking about? He knew about Steve. That woman was running around with a married man. It was Steve. That-- that's not true. Tina, we had his description. We have his name. Steve had been seeing her for weeks. That's a lie. That's a dirty, rotten, filthy lie! I'm sorry, Tina. Oh, Joe. Get out of here. JOE: Honey, I have to find him. Get out of here! JOE: Tina, I have to find him! Oh, Joe. Oh! Do you know where he is? Joe, it was a game. I was little, after my mother left, I used to have nightmares. And my Daddy would come into the room, and he would tell me not to worry. Because he would put up a wall, and it would keep all the bad things out. And it did. It really did. Joe, where did the wall go? Why did it go away? Tina, was Steve seeing that girl? I just-- I just wanted us to be happy. I-- I thought if I didn't say anything to him, the wall would still be there, and we'd be safe inside. And then she was killed. Give me police headquarters. It wasn't Steve. Joe, it couldn't have been Steve. I never said it was. Hello, this is Sergeant Marcus. I want to put out an APB on Ed Stagg. That's right, Sergeant Ed Stagg. What are we stopping here for? Something I wanna show you. Come on. It's where you used to meet her, isn't it? What's the point, Sergeant? She's dead. You ever almost drown? Go under, try to scream, but you can't. And there's nobody there to help you, nobody. No, you're on your own, nobody there to help you, nobody but yourself. I'm going back to the car. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. No, not yet. It's over, Sergeant. There's nothing here! I'm here. I'm here, and I'm drowning. Can't you get it through your head? He's a bum, a drunk! He's got no friends, no relatives, nothing. He-- he doesn't mean anything! Maybe he didn't kill her. What difference does it make? He killed somebody, didn't he? And he's gonna have to die, isn't he? If it get you off the hook, what difference does it make? What difference does it make? You lousy hypocrite. If a man doesn't know the difference between right and wrong, he might as well be living in a tree. Isn't that what you said, Sergeant? Go ahead. Climb that tree. Make me another speech. Go ahead, Sergeant. I'm waiting! Go ahead! -You thug! You immoral bum! Who do you think started this whole mess, anyway? Who? I don't know, Sergeant, but you better believe it's over. They book me, or they don't book me, I'm leveling with Tina, and I'm wrapping it up, telling her the whole bit. No. She's coming out of that box you kept her in if I have to drag her out. Maybe the air out here stinks, but she better learn to live in it. So I'm starting right now. No. Steve, no, please! No! Sergeant! It's not just Tina! It's not just her. It's you! It's me! You walk into headquarters, and-- and-- and we're all connected, all of us! I didn't do anything, Sergeant! Nothing, you gotta believe me! But I did! I killed her! God help me, I killed her. You? Yes. Oh, god help me, I killed her. It was you. All this time, all those speeches to me and Tina. I-- I just pushed her. I just pushed her, and she fell, and she hit her head. You killed her! I tell you, it was just an accident. And you'd sell the old man for it! No, I-- it was for Tina. I was trying to protect Tina. Come off it, Sergeant. Come way down off it. You weren't protecting anybody but yourself! No, no, no. That's not true. Who you covering for now? Me? Tina? The old man? Or is it you? Stop it, stop it. I listened to you all these years, and there was nothing inside those speeches-- nothing! Well, I've had it with you! Please, please! Please, Steve! No, don't! I can't help it. I'm sorry, but I can't help it. It was an accident! Like this one, Sarge? Agh! Oh, why didn't you go like I told you? Why didn't you go with Tina? Oh, ever since I killed her-- ever since I killed her, it's been like-- like something-- something inside my gut eating-- eating at me like-- like there was nothing left. Oh, Tina, Tina. Let's go. Sorry, Ed.
