Does Father know I'm going to die? Nina, please... Do you know what Julia said when she came to give me my injection? "I'm glad my father looks after you, I burn candles for you." She forgot her parasol. Let Delphine bring it back to her. Anyway, when it's the end, candles or doctors, nothing helps. Let Delphine bring it back to her. In the name of the Father... Oh! Miss Julia. Mr. Alexander. I was on my way to your place... To talk to your father. Is he here? I think so. It's not visiting hours yet. I'm concerned about Nina's health. This week, she's... How should I say this... ...faded, that's it. After the operation, we feared a relapse, but it didn't happen. My father will tell you more about it. She used to laugh so heartily. Mr. Guillermen is here. I'm busy, please forgive me. Best wishes to your sister. What can I do for you, dear sir? As I just told your daughter, I'm concerned about Nina's health. She's having a harder time sleeping. She's... like... Your daughter said so herself, she's... faded... You already told me that this morning. I know, but thinking back on it. What if we brought in a specialist? Please do, dear sir. Bring in several specialists. They'll confirm to you what you fear. That Doctor Poncenot is an idiot. A loser from the country who kills his patients. That he should be put in jail. Better yet, at the asylum. Is that what you wanted to hear? You heard it. Good evening. Dear Constantin, dear Pilou, my friends, my confidants, I have great news... I'm in love. Again? No! I can already hear Constantin shouting, "Again?" You already said that about Radinsky. - That's right! - Four years ago! And last year again with Mrs... Fa-Sol-La-Si! Yes, I know, but this time it's for real. Alexander, you're 34 years old. You're too old for love. 34 years old, yes... I'm already an old young man. If I don't love now, when will I? Her name is Julia. Hmm... She's... How can I put it... Her gaze, her voice... She's an angel. And she's so devout. She goes to church every day. A nun? Really? In her 40s? Red with whiskers! Waiter! A rosary! I lost mine. Just listen... - I enter the church behind her... - No? Yes, me, absolutely. I watch her from afar, I would like to know the words she says and say them too. To join her in her silence... I love her, that's all. "I love her, that's all." How can you say that? Love doesn't exist. Thank you. Love is an idea. An idea in your head. We've told you a hundred times. Sexual instinct exists, of course. Desire, the animal in you, it's the only thing that's real. But love, please... Can you tell us what it is? I could have... when I wasn't in love. Now, I don't know anymore. - You won't marry her, will you? - Marry her? Who knows? If you aren't afraid of loneliness, then get married. Happiness, Alexander, lasts only as long as it takes to wind up your watch. You weren't home, so I started... I'm here, everything is fine. This cancer is due to jealousy. The day I gave birth to Delphine, do you know where Grégoire was? With another woman. Now, I'm calm. But once... the night I caught him in a garden, I fell to my knees. Holy Virgin... Protect me. It was dark, I can still see the moon. Alex... You're not handsome, but you're so kind... Nina? So, did she eat dinner? Barely. She can't recover without eating. Force-feed her like a goose. By the way, my friend, you found a distraction. We are so bored in our blessed city. I'm happy for you. What do you mean? I saw you coming out of Doctor Poncenot's house. You're not going there for her father, I hope? Not really. Beware, Julia's heart is under lock and key. Under lock? Oh, my beautiful darlings! Are you coming to say goodnight to daddy? - Goodnight, Daddy. - Goodnight, my doves. Goodnight, my roses. Daddy, have you seen the mouse? What mouse, my kitten? The one that came out of mommy's shoe. - What? - Does that mean she's going to die? Did you hear that? - It's coming from you, you old witch! - I didn't say anything. Off you go! Give your uncle a kiss and go to bed. As soon as Nina is... I mean, when the time comes... I'm going to wipe it all clean, big time! I'm starving. Aren't you? Come and have dinner at my place. Give it to me. Thank you. What did you mean by "lock"? - Lock? - About Julia's heart. Oh, yes! Sergeant Filippo. He was engaged to Julia since she was 15 years old. Then the war came, he was made prisoner in Sedan, at the same time as the emperor. He tried to escape, the Prussians shot him. Farewell, Filippo. As for Julia, farewell men. She only cares for Jesus Christ. She prays a lot. As for the rest... it's under lock. Nini! We have a visitor. Set another plate, I invited my brother-in-law. Over there, Nina and two girls. Here, Nini and two boys. The townsfolk are shocked. At least I'm not hiding it. It puts love in its place. What is love? Right, Nini? Have a seat. Love... it's an electrical phenomenon. We have glands full of fluids in our skin. You just have to meet someone with matching fluids, and that's it, you're in love! You'll see that later, boys, and you'll say, "Daddy was right." So Nini, what's for diner? Milk soup, cold veal and chocolate mousse. Will that do? I don't want any. Yes, thank you. You'll love it. My poor Alexander... You'll suffer. You'll be cheated. All women cheat. You will cheat in your turn. And one day you'll find out that it was all for nothing. Nonsense. Trifles. I'm in love! I'm in love! I've come to see you. What energy! You can't play like that in the big cities. My sister sends you back this parasol that you had forgotten. Please give it to me. It's so wonderful. Wonderful? I would like to keep it as a reminder of you. As you wish, but there's nothing wonderful about it. Come in. - I'm not disturbing you? - I would like to be disturbed. It's the countryside here. Nothing ever happens. Besides, we're always worried. Every time the doorbell rings, you wonder what's going on. It's nerve-wracking. Come in. If you accept to be my wife, I would give everything. What are you saying? Everything! I would give everything I own if you would marry me. I can't! Please excuse me. Alexander Guillermen proposed to me. Nina's brother? I don't understand why... It just came out of nowhere. He never courted me. Well, I'm delighted. This is finally your chance to part with me. I understand you. Living with a widower at your age... A man who's no longer in his right mind. I can't wait to die, may the devil take me away. Everyone will be happy. Congratulations. I said no. I can't accept, can I? Red is yes, black is no. Forgive me for yesterday. Forgive me as well. "I'd give everything," I spoke to you like a shopkeeper. I was so unpleasant... I haven't slept all night. I slept very well, on the contrary. Like a dead man. Your refusal was like swallowing arsenic. The worst was said yesterday, today... I don't feel embarrassed anymore, I can speak frankly. I love you as I have never loved anyone. Not even my poor mother or my sister. I can live without my sister or my mother. But without you, life is meaningless. I've been thinking a lot since last night. I accept. You... Oh, Julia! You... Julia... Why did this happen? What's wrong? What's wrong, my darling? Speak, I beg you, tell me the truth. It's nothing. I'll be a faithful wife. My two daughters... Promise me. Promise you? When I die, take my daughters with you. I promise. I promise. Welcome to your home, Mrs. Guillermen. Pilou! The groom and his nun! Constantin's house is right next door. Here are my two damned souls, Constantin Biochon our neighbor, a lawyer. We were raised together. - Ma'am. - You can call me Julia. This one is our eternal student. He vowed to shave his beard the day he finished his studies. For now, judge for yourself. - Ouch! - It's tough! As for his name, it's unpronounceable. Call me Pilou, it will be easier. And this is Pierre. He's the most dedicated man I know. I was for it. I'm against it. Well, almost. I was talking about celibacy. Since you walked in, my convictions have been shifting. To your happiness. To your happiness! And to our benefactor! - What benefactor? - Oh... The emperor, of course! Didn't you tell her? - No, Julia is a little tired. - No, I want to know. It's a very simple story and also a fairy tale. In 1860, Napoleon III and Eugenie came to Aix and decided to enlarge the thermal baths. He allocated 1.6 million francs. And who got the piping contracts? - His father! - His father! Whose father was a small locksmith with a store in town. - He made pipes. - You drove over them. It gurgles in Aix. What we hear gurgling, is Guillermen's fortune. Today, his father is the director of two companies and 60 workers. That's why he can roll his thumbs and shower us with champagne! And why we drink to the emperor's health. Napoleon, wherever you are, thank you for Alexander and too bad for Sedan! Pilou! Would you like to see our... Our room. Never speak about Sedan again! Ever! Take this! Leave! I'm sleeping here tonight! Yes? - Are you ready? - Yes, come in. You don't like the flowers? Yes, but at night, that smell is... I warn you, my father is a monster. Above all, don't mention Nina to him. He forbade her to marry Grégoire, she did it anyway and he disowned her. And his granddaughters too. They're dead to him. I was lucky, I was able to escape. But my brother, Edgar, who works with him... Well, you'll see. Very well. He'll be jealous. Julia. Father! God has sent us great joy. Alexander returned with his wife. It's been a long time since we last saw you, dear sir. And you're married, I hear. I threw myself at my father's feet for his consent. And I was over 40 years old. You changed that, great. And you came with the lady? When the prophet Samuel arrived before Bethlehem, the elders asked him, "Is it peace that enters with you?" The prophet replied, "May the light of the Lord be upon you, that is peace." Julia, servant of God, is it also peace that enters with you? Bless you, my child. Edgar, you have to get married too! She smells so fresh! Nina? The operation? It was useless. Oh... It's God's will. And father? He's almost blind, but he's still working. He checks the accounts, but he confuses the figures. He thinks the accountant's stealing from him. He's really despicable. How can you stand him? I escape. I meditate. I reflect on things. On the soul of the people. On Europe. On what? You have to think big. Think outside the box. You have to push the boundaries. You have to... Edgar... She's very pretty, you know. I envy you. I've made a lot of money and my children use it. You should live here with me. You could make some. I would teach you. No. I thank you for being here. Why did you say he's a monster? I saw a very good and gentle man. Oh... When I was a child, do you know what was the first thought I had in the morning? It was, "Is he going to beat me today?" "It shapes you," he said. So, on the nose, on the neck, his foot in my kidneys. When I was a child... I didn't have a childhood. Nothing but terror and humiliation. But you're here now. You saved me. It was my mother who started this puzzle. She told me that there was a path in this forest. A small tunnel through which to escape. There are blue pieces. It's the sky, no doubt. - But where? On top? On the bottom? - There, outside. What was your life like before? You went out with Constantin and Pilou every night? Women, too? Why change your boyish habits? Because... we drank, we danced, we played. So? We gave it to me for people to see. Watch out! Alexander, join us! We're going to play baccarat. You'll teach me. No, not tonight. Another time, I promise. Tonight... Tonight, let's go home. No! Place your bets. The bets are made and you can't change them. That's my card! Nine wins. You win on the first board, you lose on the second. The bank loses. - Spend the evening with me. - No, Pauline. You can't refuse. I'm winning. I was sure to win with the ten of spades. Do you want to go all in? Tell Constantin to take care of Julia. I'll be back shortly, I ran into Mrs. Fa-Sol-La-Si. No? Nine, eight. Calm down. Pauline, please, calm down. Calm down, Pauline. Pauline! Ah! Could you... Pauline? Pauline? Five piano lessons today! They were all terrible! As soon as I have three pennies to spare, I'm leaving. Anywhere near the sea. I love the sea. No. Who did you marry, wretch? I loved you for your heart, for your brains. She loves your money. - It's not true! - I won't lose sleep over it. You're like all the others. Youth is what you're after. A body, beauty, youth! Are you happy at least? Does she love you? No... No. If you must know, I'm very unhappy. She married me without love. Maybe out of interest, but without thinking. It's been three months, three terrible months. At night, I feel like a monster. I force her. Every single time. But... She's afraid of me. Afraid and ashamed! She still takes your money. That's silly, Pauline! She married me to leave her father and probably to forget someone. If you were poor, are you sure she would have married you? "Sure"... I'm not sure of anything! Please, Pauline, let's not talk about this. Do you love her? Madly. Her body, her youth! You're an animal, you disgust me! Oh no, Pauline... I was detained. Nina? Everyone was expecting it. Nina more than anyone, but when it happens... Do you remember the day of the wedding? I promised to take care of them. Who? The two girls. But not here, we don't have the space. They're your nieces. What about our children, if we have any? Why not? Constantin's place is big. We'll work it out with him. Either way, I promised. Two... Three... Yes? Four... - Come and replace me. - Five... I'm teaching them the holy story, but they keep crying for their father. You know how to make them laugh. There. No, don't get up! We are going to take photographs while continuing the lesson. - So where were you? - At the flood. Know one thing, the flood didn't happen. When I raise my right hand, don't move, okay? Get ready... Is this what you wanted? To have the people between us? - As many people as possible! - So? So... why did you agree to marry me? Help, they're in tears! Tell them that their daddy telegraphed, he's coming tonight! - Come and take a trip around the world! - What's that? No, no trip today! Around the world, my darlings! You'll see, it's so fun! Beautiful children, the earth is round. Embark on a world tour. You're not coming? I can't sit, I have long legs. What if the boat sinks? It can't, miss, it's too pretty a boat. Your uncle Alexander will accompany you. That's right. Goodbye Europe, hello Asia. Beware of Asia, Alexander. It's full of belly dancers. Like in Arabian Nights. Why tell him about the Arabian Nights? He doesn't read. No novel, no book. The newspaper sometimes. - And even then... - I will send a postcard! He's right about the novels. Silly love stories, he loves her, she doesn't, with sighs and exclamations. A novel should raise problems. Social justice, rich's lowness. In Romeo and Juliet, what would be the point of talking about freedom of the press or the jail system? I'm not talking about Shakespeare, but novelists who should forget love. - We're going to Africa, Julia! - Have a nice trip, my darlings! I told you it was fun. I agree with you about romance novels. Always dates, betrayals, reconciliations. It's for rich people. There are many sick or poor people who must find this distasteful. Right? What are you talking about? Of love. And rich people. She says it's easier to love when you're rich. When you don't have to worry about being hungry, you can focus on it. Yes, I'm rich. So what? Does that make me happier than you? Look at Nina. Was her money useful when she got sick? No, she's dead. And if someone doesn't love me, no matter how much I spend, I can't force love. You can go. You can help others. Help? What help? Yesterday, I met a mathematician who's looking for a place. Of course, I could give him money. What about him? That's probably not what he's looking for. What has he got to do with it? Nothing is easier than helping a poor person! Julia! - Here I am! - Daddy! - I'm coming! - Daddy! My gazelles! My angels... So, brother-in-law? Does the electric fluid work? I'm here for you. For a great deal in real estate, if you know what I mean. Do you know who I chose as a partner? You, my friend! Partner? To forward the money. Do you trust me? Yes. The benefits will multiply like the bread of the Gospel. And it will change the everything... For them, dear friend. To give them a dowry. Your darling nieces. You can't refuse. How much? Good evening, Mr. Alexander. Did you see them? Not tonight, sir. I looked for them everywhere, I don't understand. Did you see them? No, sir. Electric love. Yeah right... The Russian way! I understand that you hate me and that I disgust you. But you could lie in front of others. You could spare me. I'm sorry. We've been married for six months. Not a glimmer, not a word. You only talk to God. What do you tell him in your prayers? Teach me the words! At least let me know! Why did you marry me? You didn't like me, you didn't love me! It was for the money, right? It's the money! Always the money! No, I swear to God! I have no need for money. I was afraid, that's all. Of ruining your life, by refusing. I hurt you, I'm sorry. It's because I love you. Like a madman. Don't say it was a mistake. Make me believe. Give me a glimpse of love. A glimpse... Try to lie. Make me believe. You don't mind if we travel together? No, I'm glad. When I heard you were leaving, I wanted to go see my Father. I thought, "Why not!" - Do you often get these urges? - Oh... When I have small problems with my husband. He's a strange one. All Guillermen are weird. Alexander is fine, but his brother, Edgar, is a complete idiot. Do you have a lover? You're talking nonsense. You're awfully charming though. Forgive me for this description, but you remind me of a fresh cucumber that has already taken on a little salt and is soaking up fennel. You're crazy. There, there... It's not scary at all. You're just not used to it. At my age, that's all I can give you. I'm... How should I put it... impotent. Catch. I don't like sweets. You act like a child. So you're having fun. You go dancing. You go to the theater. You spend your husband's money, that's fine. You forgot your old man. Don't worry, I'll die soon. You'll be rid of me. Would you like to be a grandfather? A child? Yes, from Alexander. That's why I came. For you to take care of us both until Easter. Lock me up before the birth so that he won't be ashamed of me! Father! A straitjacket for the old man who insists on staying alive! Must we share everything, Father? Even prayer? My husband is jealous when I pray. He wants to know what I'm saying. "Teach me the words." But I have no words. For me, prayer is... It is sometimes this blue, it's the smell of incense, it's silence. Am I guilty? Yes, Julia. Prayers are words given by God. You must say them out loud. Like our ancient martyrs, the first Christians, we return to the catacombs. In Paris, the government is questioning the budget for religions. - And abolishing... - Farewell, Father. Julia! You didn't listen to me. And I don't understand you. I tell you about my innermost secret, jealousy, prayer, and you respond with the catacombs. By coming here, I was hoping... I don't know what I was hoping for. Perhaps measure the distance between two Julias. But here, nobody knows me anymore. "Without you, no more champagne bubbles." "Constantin and Pilou." Bad news? Non, but... They're so silly! We said until Easter. What else can I do? They miss me. Meeting a dead person is good luck. This is my mother's house. She was born by the lake. She lived there until her marriage. Light, fresh air and rest. Everything that doctors advise until birth. You shouldn't stay up too long. Aix is close by, on the other side. Constantin and Pilou will come to see you. As soon as you need the doctor, he'll hop on a boat. There are houses all around anyway. And even a midwife in the next village. Where were you? There. Do you feel that calm? It could be the one we will reach, after so much crying and tears, thanks to our child. You mean you'll love me? Love is too complicated. No. I mean, being together, getting along. Looking at each other without being afraid. I'll take care of the luggage. Oh... I know, it's ridiculous, but my daughter is wonderful, I say it out loud. As soon as she's changed, call me, so I can feed her. Are you messing with me? I think of Alexander. Of him and her, who do you like best? Alexander... I never loved him deeply, if you want the truth. My daughter is my first love. I never would have said that a year ago. I thought I had loved. Really loved. Someone. They were passions of youth. Nonsense, basically. What good is love? We do without it. So, why do you live with Alexander? Whenever he is away for a long time, I miss him. Alexander is good, smart, I have esteem for him, that's enough for me. The rest is for romance novels. Nonsense. As I said. Alexander? No, Pilou with his harvest. So? - It's the best trout I've ever caught. - Oh, it's amazing! Not with your wet boots. Go around by the kitchen. Tell Peter to cook it for dinner. She's ready! Oh, my daughter's hungry. Come to dinner, too. - What about Marina? - She has a high fever tonight. When you go to say good night, don't enter her room. Blow her a kiss from afar. Come along. Aren't you waiting for my Alexander? He's been going away more. Sometimes he comes home in the morning. I think he plays cards with the neighbor. There are only women here. You should have a good watchdog. Listen... Hush, hush... Marina's coughing, I thought it was my daughter. If she still has a fever tomorrow, I'll call the doctor. Let's go home. The champagne is fine, but the cognac... I'll take care of it. Don't worry, it won't go to waste. Goodnight! It's so cold. Oh, Constantin! Yeah? - What are you doing? - I'm counting the stars. They look like brand new gold coins. Like Alexander's fortune. And mine, by proxy. I owe everything to this guy. When my father died, Luc Guillermen said, "We're keeping Constantin." "He's part of the family." Since that day, I'm Alexander's little brother. I sleep in his old sheets, I steal from his wallet. My prayer every morning is, "Saint Alexander, pay for me." If by proxy, I could replace him in Julia's bed... You drank too much, shut up. We think we're smart, Pilou? We shout out loud, "Love!" Bullshit... We find ourselves like a rat... dying in it's trap. A rat! But without squeaking! Don't let Alexander know that someone tried to nibble his cheese. - Nature, may the devil take you! - Calm down. Citizens, I arrested a socialist! Come along. You know what I'm jealous of? Of her old slippers that see her every day. It was diphtheria. - Marina? - Yes. She gave it to Julia who gave it to our daughter. Marina is cured, Julia too, our daughter... Died? Yes. No, no... She's... What a pain. I didn't know that was possible. She's growing up, it's crazy. What? Delphine, she's growing up so fast. I'm constantly lengthening her dresses. - Ouch! - What's the matter? I always forget my thimble. I'm so stupid. Just a moment, Pauline. I just want to listen to you work. I need it. I really do. Is marital bliss no longer enough for you? We lost our daughter. Julia is grieving terribly. She's been crying for weeks. Since I can't take it anymore, she goes to Constantin's house. She'll have dozens more, it doesn't take much wit to bring children into the world. All this work made me hungry. It's Pilou. No way... So what? You... You are housing him? He doesn't twiddle his thumbs. He's a smart guy. He works. We're from the same world. Stay if you like, you don't have to do anything. I have lessons to give. What's that? Who's there? Don't be afraid. - It's me, Alexander. - Oh. It's you. You found out. Yes. I figured it out. Are you... Are you jealous? Jealous? Of course not. I applaud you, on the contrary. She's harsh, poorly groomed, and frumpy, but she has great strength of spirit. You know what she said about my daughter? She said, "You'll make ten more." Then she added, "It doesn't take much wit to bring children into the world." Can you believe it? You, me, and Constantin said so many things like that in the past. It made me think back to the old days. I was still free. I still believed in promises. I was without love. Without a wife. With no memories of a child. How's your life? I know you always mock me. It's true, I'm eager to learn. It's in the books. Sometimes I want to leave everything. I was born to be king of Cochinchina, to smoke big pipes, have 6 000 wives and twice as many eunuchs! You never knew my dream. It was to discover the North Pole. Oh... White bears, Pilou. White bears on icebergs. I would leave. I've always told you, "One day, I will cut my beard and go far away." "Very far." Nothing is sure then. Nothing is permanent. Look how long your love for Julia lasted. "Love is an idea." "It doesn't exist." Do you remember telling me that? An idea in your head. Maybe you were right. I was jealous, worried, sad. I suffered. And now... Now I watch Julia suffer. I would like... I feel empty, Pilou. It's all black. I'm afraid. What if I become like my father... A monster. Come on, let's go out. Stop crying, let's go out. Otherwise, you're suffocating. Constantin, tell her that she needs to go out and have fun. You liked it before! That's all you liked. Come on. Nine. Second board loses, first board wins. See, you're winning. Just like before. Everything's like before. Place your bets. That's the game. - Please... - Nothing is right anymore. Stay with me, Alexander. I never pray anymore, why? Why did I lose my faith? Today... Today, I only have you. You again? You come every day now to read your newspaper. Do you think you're at the café? If I'm in the way, I won't come anymore. Good idea. Mr. Guillermen, my children are starving, save them! - Please. - Grégoire has disappeared. - I have no more money. - Get up. I spent what I had left to come see you. Please, calm down. I'll send you some money. Tomorrow I will give the order to my bank. Take this. - Where is he? - I don't know. He forbade you to say it, but you know! If you see him, tell him I love him. What? I love him. I'm waiting for him. Tell him to come back. He's my greatest joy. Oh, here comes Alexander. The factory is a mess. He's blind, but still in charge. We're losing money. Come help me. Work here with you? No way. You're forgetting your duty. We are a family of noblemen. That old man is obnoxious, I have nothing to do with him. His business is worth millions, you get the profits and you're happy. Oh really? Here we are, then. If I had a bit of willpower I would have earned my bread alone a long time ago. But I'm a prisoner. Like you. A prisoner! Edgar! This house is strange. I no longer recognize the layout of the rooms. Strange house, don't you think? Me, a nobleman? I would like a glass of water. Little sister. It's fine. My sister Nina... Every night, she enters my room. She sits against my bed. Me, a nobleman? - Look at me. - In a chair. Look at me. I'm afraid of everything! Police officers, gendarmes, janitors, Swiss people! - And for what? - We must take him home. Huh? All that for what? Call a doctor. Because my father has beaten me! Do you know what my mother died of? She was afraid of him. Who's there? Julia, your daughter-in-law. Oh, Julia... I can't see anymore. I see the window, the fire when it's lit... But objects and people... Julia... You've come to learn how to make money. I came with a doctor for Edgar. Edgar? What's wrong with him? A cold, maybe. Look how sick I am. I've never seen a doctor in my life. You need to be looked after. The balance sheet, the inventory, call it what you will, but I want to see it right now. And don't cheat, I'm watching. If you treat me like a child, I'll close this place down! I hate this job, but my father is blind, my brother is sick, there's just me. So tell me the truth. - Is that really what you want? - Yes. To sum it up, iron is finished, we are entering the age of steel. The age of steel... I went to the World's Fair in 1878 and saw an extraordinary tool on display at the Schneider's stand in Le Creusot. It's called a sledgehammer. It's our death warrant. Do you have a plan? We've had one for a while. Your father always refused to hear it. We'll see. I'll be back tomorrow. With your two granddaughters. Surely not. They're illegitimate. - Nina was legally married. - Without my consent. Does the word forgiveness not exist for you? In my business, when you forgive, in three years you are bankrupt. Father... You're old, you'll die soon. Mice are already coming out of your shoes. God won't ask you if the money was flowing in, he'll ask if you were not too hard on your employees, servants and children. "Hard," me? A benefactor. When I die, they'll pray for me. Poor Edgar... The doctor says he must be taken to the asylum. I won't allow it. Edgar is my brother, we'll care for him at home until the end. "Happiness lasts just long enough to wind up your watch." Who said that already? - It was Pilou. - Finally. I placed a blue piece. And yet, I've known happiness. You forgot your parasol at Nina's, do you remember? So I carried it to my room, opened it and slept under it. It was... a moment of bliss. I think it's over there. There it is. Another one. You were carrying it the day you proposed to me. You said, "It's so wonderful. Give it to me." - I said that, are you sure? - Absolutely. It made me want to laugh. I didn't see why. So, you kept it. There's a gentleman with a package. A package? It's for you. Pilou! There's no more Pilou, see? Well, I'll be damned! Oh! Why did you shave it? I'm going to war in Tonkin. What? The hostilities have resumed. Captain Rivière seized the citadel of Hanoi. I signed my commitment this morning. 6 000 women... And twice as many eunuchs! We'll put it on the horse. Madness! We're going to do the craziest things to celebrate. We'll celebrate your departure. Pierre, go get Monsieur Constantin! Come on. Let's all go. For my Pilou's final night. If you' re willing to be my Pilou for one more evening. I'll watch the kids. Ladies and gentlemen, I present you the first bearded horse in the history of the world! Bravo! Gentlemen! Cheers, to your distant war. To your secret love. It made them laugh. Did you see? I'm done. The tunnel your mother was talking about. There, at the bottom right. Tonkin, the North Pole... Why so far? Thanks to this small tunnel... We're together now. The memory of our daughter is part of my life. I like your mother's house. As soon as the weather is nice, I'll take the kids. You can join us as soon as you can. Three days. I've waited three days. I was worried. It's because of Quentin. We worked until midnight. - We'll start over. - That bad? If only you knew... It's strange how empty it is when you're away, I miss you. Whenever I see you, I'm happy. I love you. Alexander! Uncle Alexander. Hello. Your grandfather sends you his love, uncle Edgar can't say his name anymore and I'm starving. Off with you! From Tonkin, my friend, our Pilou. He didn't bother with writing. "Hot as hell." You're it! Let's go play in the yard! How did she catch up with me? Don't lose the balls, we already lost two. We'll be careful. They grew up so fast... How everything changes in three years... Your turn! - Julia? - Yes, I'm here. Why just me? Come. I want to capture this moment. Why this one? We'll have others, you know. Months, years. How many do you think? Thirteen, thirty... Who knows? Whoever lives will see. Exactly. Whoever lives will see. Julia, ready? We'll live to be very old, you'll see. And then one day we'll go up there. And if He asks you, "How was life?" Asks who? - Me? - Yes, you. So, how was life? Julia? What will you say? I don't know. Ready Julia? That you've been happy. Julia! Only for a moment. Under a parasol. I don't know what I would answer. How was life... It's like asking... How were the rocks and the trees? How were the carrots? A carrot, to me, is a carrot. I don't know more.
