Excuse me, ma'am. Your hairstylist has been waiting downstairs for over two hours. I already did my hair! Drive him home or invite him to the party. Do what you wish, Nico. Good evening. -Thanks. -It's okay. Let's go. - Are you ready? - Yeah. I'm nervous about meeting your friends. You'll like them. - I didn't think you'd invite me. - Why? - Lorena, Adriana, how are you? - Hi. Thanks. This is Marcela. They are sending us the dress from Spain. Wonderful! Spanish high couture. Do you agree? It's the best. Julia will look beautiful. -She's gorgeous. -Your grandkids will be gorgeous. Come on, yours too. I heard you got the Acapulco-Ixtapa highway. -Congratulations. -Thank you, sir. -We are very happy. - I'm sure. Excuse me. Sofi. Yes? Darling... I am very hurt, you have forgotten us, you never stop by. It's your husband's fault, he makes me work overtime. Excuse me! -Yes? -The mistress dismissed the hairstylist. God. Go get Diego, tell him everything is ready. It's time, sir. We'll go in a second, Nico. Thanks. -So? -Wow. What? You look gorgeous. You, too. -So, are you ready? -Yes. I love you. - I love you. - I love you more. Let's go. To the bride and groom! To the bride and groom! - Congratulations, man. - Thanks, mate. - Darling...! Excuse me! - What is it, mom? Come say hi to the Governor, because I think your dad already did. - Miss Julia Miramiel? -Jerónimo? Could you give us a minute, girls? Do a little spin... Well, it's not that bad. You look beautiful. -Thanks a lot! -Yes. Are you ready for New York? Let's not talk about that, okay? Come with me, darling. Excuse us. -Let's go with Diego. -You look gorgeous, mom. You, too. You look beautiful. -Welcome to the family. -Thank you. -Thanks a lot. -You look beautiful. Diego... -Thanks for everything. -No, thank you. We are really happy. Let me see the ring. -It's amazing. -Wonderful. I am very proud to ask for Julia's hand to marry my son. Marriage is man's best team. Well, only after "Real Madrid". Son... Julia shares your values. And through commitment, you will build a loving home. I am sure you will be very happy as a team. I am excited to witness this great story that begins today. -Cheers! Cheers! -To the future grandkids! - Cheers! Julia, from the first time I saw you, I knew you were a special woman. But when I got to meet you, I realized I'd never find someone like you. These ten years together have been wonderful. And I'd like to spend the rest of my life with you. Ma'am... I'd like to ask for your daughter's hand. It will be an honor to join our families. You have my blessing, Diego. Honey? -Of course, handsome! -A thousand times yes. - Bravo! - To the bride and groom! - Cheers! -Are you kidding, Maca? -It's medicinal. -Cancer must have its perks. - -Here. -No, no. -If Julia sees me, I'm dead. -No. Mrs. Perfect won't say a thing, she's your number one fan. Dieguito, please, join me for some pictures. -Sure. Let's go. -Excuse us, ma'am. Hurry up, Dieguito. AND THEN I MET YOU Chef... I love you. What's wrong? I don't want to go. Come on, honey! New York is far away. Honey... you'll be the first woman with that certification in Mexico. And they don’t accept just anybody. And not just anybody gets to marry the love of their life. That's why I love you. I love you. -I love you. I'll miss you a lot. -I'm being serious. I will, too. I am very proud of you. When you come back, we'll be together forever. -Forever? -Forever. -The Father was very kind. - Yes. -Come in, please. -You know him. We got the church. Yeah, well, through a small donation to Father Ignacio, you know. You know him. -When is the date? -October 10th. Yes. Like you wanted, darling. -October 10th. -Are you ready for your trip? -Well, yeah. -Is everything ready? - Be safe. - Yes. And you know, Juli, call me when you land. - I will. - Have a nice flight. - Thanks. - Goodbye. Take care. -You, too. -We will visit you. -Please do. -Yes. -Have a nice trip. -Thanks a lot. If you need anything, I've got contacts. -I'm coming. Jero! - Jerito. -Jerito, it's late. -Honey, let's go. -Take this, for good luck. -What is it? Hurry up, darling, you'll miss the flight. -Jul... -Thanks. I'm coming! -Let's go. -I'm coming. - How are you? -Fine. Thanks. Have a good flight. -Bye. - Be safe. Ma'am, you have arrived to your destination. Okay. Thank you. It's a big saving, the Governor will be very happy. I was thinking of some fauna areas. No, we share the savings with the Governor, the rest are bonuses. -But we can... -How is Julia by the way? -Will you visit her? -Yes. I'll surprise her next week. -Good. Please, give her our regards. -I will. Well, bye, Dad. - Laura, you look good today. - Hi, man. How are you? Much better now that I see you. Why? What's wrong? I thought I'd find you crying your eyes out and listening to heartbroken songs. No, I don't cry at work. Come in already. So, how is everything going? Not that bad, struggling with the permits for the swamp building complex. I suggested that you find another land. It's not up to me, talk with your dad, man. Check this out. We could celebrate your birthday there And your bachelor party, too. We'll see, okay? Let's do it next weekend, so you stop mourning. Listen. I know this really hot DJ, and besides, she is great. We'll do an open bar, and I'm thinking black suit dress code. To keep it elegant, mate. -Mate, what have I told you? -What? -You have to be social. -All right then. Hi, Maca. Hi, sweetheart. -How are you? -Fine. - Want some? You do, right? -Yes. Don't tell Hitler, okay? Your mom is really something. She even spies on me. Cheers! -Cheers, sweetheart. -How are you? -Splendid! -How did your lab results turn out? Terrible. I'm quitting western medicine. So, now you believe in vodka. Why not? You live righteously and one day you wake up to know you've got cancer. So, what's the point? God, you're boring. I can open you a Facebook account. Maca! -Maca! What are you doing? -You'll grab it later. So, how is the wedding going? You worry about getting better. No, you should be worried. It's worse to get married and regret it than talk and... -No, I won't regret it. -You won't? -You didn't regret it, did you? -More than you think. You knew me as an old woman. I used to be Mrs. Perfect, too. I was kind to everybody, even those who didn't deserve it. I would never speak my mind. I let somebody else make my own decisions. And it took me years to understand that my life was my own. Darling. Hi, mom. Pills and vodka don't go together. No, it's okay, my general. Hi. Darling, we need to listen to the chorus and see if we like it for the church. Yes. Any day next week. Except Tuesday. "Yes, any day". "Except Tuesday." Please. I understand... I understand you are upset. But if you yell... Don't do that to the bell. You'll break it, sir. Hold on a second. Hold on. Lu... Lu, I'm sorry to wake you up, but the clients are going crazy. Are you Diego Cuenca? You signed for 200 guests, these are over 300. 300? No way! Diego Cuenca, the birthday guy. Lu López, Hotel Manager. Well, join the party, so then we can be 301. -It's not funny. The hotel guests are furious, and your guests are trashing the facilities. Don't worry. Charge any expenses to my card. And tell your guests to join the party. You've got 30 minutes to take your guests out or I'll call the police. -Come on! -Please. Go, now. - Who was she? -The manager. She wants to call the police. Relax, have fun. Leave it all to me. Cheers! Come here, doll. - Hey, DJ! -Come on! No, no, no. Go back. The party is over. Come on, man. Hurry up. Come on. - Go. Mr. Cuenca! Wow! -Cuenca, stop it. -Enough. Damn it! You'd better have enough funds. I'm sorry, Dad. Did I wake you up? Over thirty and about to get married. I have put up with a lot. But to set fire to a hotel! Boss, the truth is, I... Stay out of it, Jerónimo. They are going to sue us, Diego. And we don't need nor deserve such a scandal. No, Dad. I'll deal with it. I can... Of course you will. You are old enough. And you, too, Jerónimo. You'll take care of all the legal matters. Yes, sir. I'm very disappointed, son. You'll go to the hotel immediately. But today is Sunday. You will go now because you start tomorrow. -But Dad... -That's it. Shut up! Dad... I am going to New York. Forget about your trip. I am sorry, man. But you will do a great job with the hotel. "I am very disappointed!" Happy birthday! -You look beautiful. -Thanks. Hey, how was your birthday party? -It was a total mess. -Why? Are you all right? I just needed to hear you. Tell me about it. We got to this place and there were around 300 people. -Are we closing? -I can't tell you. -Tell me. -We won't close. Hi, Lucía, I came with an offer. My name is not Lucía. -Luciana? -Lu. Lucrecia? Lucerito? Lulú? Luchadora? If you care, find out. Truth is, the hotel can use a little fixing... and my family... Well, that is my job. And I am planning a pro bono job. Pro bono? Rich people call it that way to avoid a lawsuit? No, no, we are respectable people. We have built highways, buildings, dams. -You are in luck. -"In luck"? With a burnt down hotel and no guests? Well, the hotel's owner already agreed. He is making me stay until you are done. I got a job offer abroad and I will lose it. You will have new offers. You aren’t used to get a no for an answer, right? And you aren’t used to be polite. Politeness is earned, Mr. Cuenca. You will be surprised when... Your daddy has forgiven you for a four-star hotel remodeling? I won't remodel it. It will become self-sustainable. A design space. People will want to travel here just to book a room in this hotel. Good afternoon, Mr. Cuenca. See you tomorrow. What is it? What are you doing home? God! What's wrong, Yuri Guadalupe? Hi, honey. How was your day? But you weren't fired? No. But the owner told me I have to stay until that idiot rich "Ken", a good-for-nothing citizen, who, evidently, didn't get enough oxygen at birth, finishes the construction. I can't do it. That woman is a nightmare. Of course you can do it. They will love you, like everybody. -Ken? -Barbie's boyfriend, mom. -The one I used to behead. She hates society. She thinks I am a spoilt kid, she won't even listen to me. If you are in his hands, make it work. Diego, you've always wanted a project like this. And you are very good at what you do, so enjoy it. That asshole is blowing my trip to China. Everything will be all right. It isn't that easy. It isn't that easy, mom. Had I known he would be this late, I’d had grabbed some breakfast, boss. Come on, Chatito, you aren't the only early bird. Good morning. Your people are waiting for you since 7 a.m., architect. Engineer. He is Chato, the hotel's maintenance manager. He can solve any doubts. Excuse me. -Hi. -Chatito, at your service. Well, where shall we start? You are the boss. So, let's clean all this mess. Very well, sir. Everybody, start cleaning! My name is, I am... I am Lu. I am Lu. So, Mandarin, Yuri Guadalupe! I need you to sign these designs. Well, if you approve them. I don't get this part, it's unnecessary. It's a priority. They are solar panels to save energy. But they get in the way of the view. So, what shall we change then, Yuri Guadalupe? I'll send you my annotations, engineer. What's the story behind "Yuri Guadalupe"? That's none of your business, Mr. Cuenca. Well, I'll leave them here, so you can make annotations. See you tomorrow, Yuri Guadalupe. So now, once you've taken the top off, you are gonna grab the nitrogen, and very carefully, you're gonna pour a bit. Happiness, Xingfu. Xingfu. Shrimps, Xia. Xia. Shrimps, Xia. Xia. No. Let's go home, man. I'm not done yet. See you tomorrow? Darling, be careful. -Out. -Sorry. Out. How is New York going, honey? Rob is making me work hard, I haven't seen much. They are very well. What do we do next, sir? Wait for your boss approval. You, too? Will you sell the hotel to the Chinese? -Don't be nosy, Chatito. -Were you looking for me? You can address me informally, Yuri Guadalupe. We will be working together for a long time. This is the new plan considering your annotations. What about the vine? I was thinking that from... All these windows are messing with the colonial space. No, I won't sign anything until I am happy with the project. The longer it takes you to sign, the longer we will be here. He's right, Yuri Guadalupe. Well, if you did your job well, everything will be different. Excuse me. - Would you like one? - No, Thanks. I quit. WHAT'S WRONG, DIEGO? WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER? - Are you OK? - Yeah. Sorry. You should know I'm engaged. Morning, Yuri Guadalupe. Lu! I am fine today, and you? Lu, I get your point on the panels, and trust me, I am trying hard to... -Did you bring the new plans? -Yes, here they are. You won't like them, I don't... So, why are you here? Well, all the workers are waiting. Please, sign so we can start. I promise when we set up the panels they will harmonize with the space. I thought my sign was a courtesy. It is our project. Why should I trust you? Because I am really interested in making this hotel stand out. Besides... I can help you with your Mandarin. Do you speak Mandarin? Let me buy you lunch. Let's bury the hatchet. You've got nothing to lose. Don't make me regret it... engineer. See you at 3 p.m. At the hotel entrance. Busy. Good news. Yuri Guadalupe will sign the contracts and we can start. -How did you convince her? -I've got my tricks. -What is this? -Heartbroken songs. Cutie! You miss her. Come, I'll give you a hug. -How is Julia? -Fine. She's is doing good. -I'll call her later. -Yeah. Let's have a celebration lunch. I can't, dinner tomorrow? -Tomorrow? Let me check. -Come on! The day after tomorrow? -Okay. -Fine. -Now, get to it. -Okay, see you. -Chatito. -Sir? Okay, we can start now. I never thought we'd come to a place like this. Me neither. - Do you want shrimps? - Yeah, sweet and sour? Welcome. Two plates of shrimps. Sweet and sour. For you, too? Sweet and sour, too? Yeah, yeah. Thanks. We don't usually use "sweet and sour" in business. -Not any other term, man. - HI, JU. DID DIEGO TELL YOU? HI. YEAH, HE SAID THE MANAGER IS A NIGHTMARE. YES, BUT TODAY SHE APPROVED THE PROJECT. CONGRATULATIONS. We are sorry. Your call didn't go through. Please try you call again. Thank you. Thank you. So, tell me something in Chinese. Are you happy? That is a very tough question. Why? It's the easiest. Are you happy? You think happiness is a state of being? Yeah, you don't? To me, happiness are moments. When you fulfill a dream, you feel really free. What is your name? Sorry? The answer was, "My name is Diego". As you can see, I am not very good at speaking Chinese. Here. So you never stop traveling. Hi, honey. Sorry I didn't answer. How are you? Fine. Fine. Jero told me the manager approved the project. Congratulations. Yeah, we have finally started. What about you? Fine, I am learning a lot. Listen, I am cooking, can we talk later? Could you let me know any other news? Yeah, I will. Sleep well. You, too.Bye. SO YOU START TRAVELING AROUND THE WORLD, D. - Next week, any time. - I won't get dirty. I'll call you later, I am very busy. Sorry. Okay, bye. Careful, Chatito. -Give it to me. -Hold on, man! Thank you, sir. -But Emeterio will listen to me. -All right. Be careful. Good morning, Yuri Guadalupe. Lu. Until you tell me the story behind your name... For me? Thanks. Hey, I was thinking about what we talked about the other day. We talked about a lot of things. I mean happiness. And you can... watch this with whoever you want. It is about that. Want to watch a movie about happiness? I have an extra ticket. Really? Shall I pick you up? No, it's okay, I'll meet you there. Bring a sweater, it is outdoors. -Outdoors? -Never watched a movie outdoors? Jero, I'm sorry. Don't kill me. My dad wants me to meet him for dinner today. Should we reschedule? -Hey! -Damn it! -Are you the messenger? -Not at all, sir. Hey! Where shall we meet? Camila, it was a pleasure to meet you. Call me any time. Okay? -Thanks. -Jero? Are you having dinner here? No, sir. At my house, to be more relaxed. But I suck at cooking. I see. Tell Diego to accept my invitations more often. -Right. -Let's go. -Good night, gentlemen. -Good night. WHERE ARE YOU, MAN? JERO, I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW, I'LL... No cell phones at the movies. Come. Is it a black and white film? No, no, they'll fix the projector right away. The one afraid of suffering, is already suffering... I hate you. What does this have to do with happiness? Patience. You'll get it at the end. Let's go. Where to? -See why I haven't come here? What now? - Hey, Julia. - Hey. I want to tell you that you did a great job today. Thanks. And a dear friend of mine invited me to his new place. It's supposed to be wonderful. Do you want to come? Come on, don't even think about it. Come on, let's go. -He's a great chef. You'll love him. - Really? -Oh, yes. -But I can't go like this? Have you never tried grasshoppers? No, is it wrong? Of course! You can't be from Mexico City and haven't tried grasshoppers. Come on, man! Listen... If you try one, I'll tell you the story behind my name. All right. Come on, eat both. Come on. -Yuck! -Don't exaggerate! You'll like them, you'll see. It must be a drag to travel with you. I'm sure you haven't used the subway. No way, you liar! -You haven't. -Yes. Man, you have to get in the subway for general knowledge. How can you live in a city and not be part of it? Part of the chaos. You remind me of my grandma. Excuse me, I'm not that old. I didn't mean it that way, you look really good. I already ate it. All right, now tell me about your name. I'd better tell you the ending of the movie. No, no. Tell me about your name. Unless you don't usually keep your word. In that case, tell me whatever you want. My mom, is very devout of Our Lady of Guadalupe, and since she chose to be a single mom, she told everybody with Our Lady's favor and with her favorite singer songs, Yuri... - -Stop it! It's not her fault, she is from Veracruz. With the favor of Our Lady and Yuri's songs, she'd move forward the struggle and she did. She did a great job. So, Lupita became Lupe, and eventually, Lu. -That way... -You won't be bullied. I don't have to explain it, man! Everything is so good. -Thanks for inviting me. - My pleasure, darling. All right. Let's see what this is all about. -Try this out. Thanks. -Thanks. DIEGO, YOU HAVEN'T CONTACTED ME AT ALL TODAY... I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU. Is everything OK? Yeah. Now Jules... Listen... You are about to be married in a few months. And I'm sure that everything is gonna be great. Meanwhile, you're in the greatest city in the world. So enjoy yourself. Be in the moment. Mmhmm? Just one quick call. OK? -Really. Quickly. -Oh, sweety... So? Shall we ask for the bill? No. Waiter... Oh, you liked them, sir! Why did you pick Engineering? What I really like is design and architecture, but my dad insisted, so I chose a better course. Your phone is buzzing. You're right. -Cheers! That's the spirit. He's probably sleeping anyway. -I'll take you to a place you'll like. -Okay. It has to do with architecture and design. Let's go. -Thanks Fede for your trust. -Thanks. No problem, see you. We have to wait for the sunrise, so you can see it fully. You will love it. Sunrise? Okay. Do you want... to have breakfast? No... I... I have a lot to do. Yeah, me too. What? -You found your brush. - -Table six, sweetheart. -Yeah. - Enjoy your meal, sir. -Thanks. Hi. -What's his name? -What do you mean? -You can't fool me, Yuri Guadalupe. -Mom! I cooked something for Chatito. You'll love it, sir! Pork chops with sauce. Address me informally, Chatito. Thanks. -Want some? -No. -I knew it. It's really good, who cooked it? Who? My girlfriend. -She even has a little diner. -I'll steal her from you! She is a great cook. That's impossible, sir! How are you and Lu doing? -Is it too spicy? -No. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon, boss. Could you give me a minute, sir? Sure. Enjoy. - -I'm sorry. Enjoy. I wanted to tell you that against all odds, you are a very good traveling companion. -I had a great time. -I did, too. Really. I leave you to your job. Hi, Maca. -How are you, sweetheart? -Fine. -Are you in love? -No, Maca, no way. Then, why are you getting married? How bad is it? I don't know. I want to do everything. Try everything. I am even studying Mandarin. Oh, just in time. Go with it, sweetheart. Enjoy it. Somebody powerful enough to make you study Mandarin, must be really worth it. Maca, I'm being serious. I don't know what to do. Don't do anything, just go with it. But be clear and honest. I'll be back. - Hi, Ju, how are you? -Hey, handsome. Fine and you? Fine. Can you talk or are you still busy? Ju, I'm sorry. Don't be like that. What is it? I want to talk to you, to know how everything is going. Everything is fine. Are you okay, Diego? Yes. Sorry. I'm with Maca. Can I call you later? Okay, give her my regards. Sure, I'll tell her. Very well, sir. I like it. Now sign this one, but don't look at it. I don't like surprises. Trust me. Here. Won't you ask me anything else? Where were you heading? To an exhibition, I was taking the subway. -Are you coming or are you scared? - That look doesn't suit you. -What's wrong with you? -Good morning. -Hi, Jero. -What's up? -How are you, Jero? -Fine. I'll sign the contracts, they are in the office. What are you doing, asshole? What do you mean? I bumped into your dad, you didn't have dinner with him. Right, I went out with Lu. I have to soften her. Right, I get it. That's why you are doing it on Sundays, too. No way, man. That's not it. Come on, man. Julia doesn't deserve it. All right... I'll ask your little friend to hand me the contracts. I'll be back, man. There? Yeah, there's a "subway" sign. Right. I now start seeing What I didn't see before No, no, I don't dance. The world chases me and I feel... Come on, dance. -I'd rather dance something else. -A place to feel -That everything was worth it -Danzón? -Maybe. -Really? Perfect. They play danzón on Thursdays here. What if we go to the mountains? And we get rid of the fear That makes us stop Feeling something now That time doesn't get You have to live it to remember it. -I am living it. -Sure? Thanks. Thanks. Is this the spiciest? Yes. Just a little. Enough. Enough. - Thanks, ma'am. - You're welcome. -Want some? - No, thanks. Come. When I was a kid, my mom used to say, "Always try to live outside your comfort zone". And every time I walk by this sculpture, it comes to my mind. Look... This is your comfort zone, but everything that’s worth in life, love, adventures, madness, challenges... are here. Is that the best chef in the world? Yes! Jero, I... I wanted to ask you something. Is everything okay with Diego? Yes. I mean, he is very stressed out by work. He really misses you. That's it. Just that? -When are you coming back? -What? Why? No, hold on. I'll call you back. Thank you. Yeah, bye. Thank you. Thanks. -Yuri Guadalupe! What's wrong? -Don't make that face. - Let's move those cement bags. -The storm is over now. - No, no. Shut up! You're so stupid! Where are you having lunch? I don't know, I was going to stay here with the guys. -What? -It's on me, my turn. No way! -Where are we going? You'll love it. Where are we going? I promise you'll love it, just go with it.

No way. -Come on. -Come on. -No way. -Come on, don't be a pussy. -No. -Come. -What? Here. Look... -How do you do it? -It's simple. One step back. I'M SORRY, JU. IT'S JUST THAT... Ju! Hi. What about your course? What about it? I'll finish it later. I missed you so much. I can't believe you are here. How were your teachers in New York? They are the best chefs in the world. I learned a lot. - It's the best school. -Yes. -Yes, molecular gastronomy is awesome. -You have to cook something. If it is awesome, why did you come back, sweetheart? Mrs. Macarena, the wedding will be held soon. And Juli still has arrangements to do for the most important day of her life. Yeah, sure. Excuse me, I have to take my pills. I'll be back. Careful. Excuse her, Amalia. You have to tell her the truth. -To whom? -Both. What do you mean, Maca? There is no truth. It isn't that easy. I never said it was. All that makes us grow is hard. Living is for the brave ones, sweetheart. The longer you wait, the more you'll hurt them. - Shall I serve you? -No. No, hold on. Stop there. I'll be back. - You'll love it. - I'll get them. Hey! Dessert is ready and we are discussing the wedding. -Want to join us? -Oh, yeah. The wedding. -How exciting! -Yeah. - I'll get inside. It's cold here. -Yeah. It's terrible to wear shoes for the first time to a wedding. You have to use them before. -What do you think? -She is hanging in there. I hope she doesn't die before the wedding. -Julia! -What? -I'm sorry. -She's my grandma. I'm sorry. I was an idiot. I am nervous. Can I cook you a meal so you'll forgive me? -But... -But what? Your apartment, tomorrow. Okay? I love you, let's go. -Sweetheart! -Hi, mom. You look beautiful. Is that man responsible for it? Mom... -Can I ask you something? -Sure. -Was it worth it? -What? -To risk everything with my dad? -Absolutely. Come. Good afternoon. Man! Julia came back from New York and she is cooking tonight. -Wanna join us? -I can't, I'm very busy. Man, we haven't spent time together in a while. Let's go. -I am busy, man. - Man! We have to be social, come on. -Come on. -All right. -But I can't arrive empty handed. -Please! -You never bring anything! -Who is this woman? -Jero. -How are you? -Fine. I wasn't expecting you. I can leave if you want. - No, I'm glad you are here. - Come in. -What can I get you to drink? -Mezcal. Mezcal. Sure. -Hi, Ju. -Hi. It was a romantic dinner, Diego, I am not wearing underwear. I'm sorry. -Here. -Is everything okay? Yeah. Thanks. You're welcome. How was New York? It was okay. I didn't go out that much. The school... - Cheers. Cheers. Man! This is delicious. - Really? -Uh-huh. It is a special recipe for Diego. It's good. It tastes... - molecular. How is the wedding going? Are you ready? Yes, everything is almost ready. But Diego has been very busy. -I am almost done. -Yes. Yes, you should take a look, it's great. Really? I'd love to. Any time. So, what is going on? I don't know. Man, you've got everything. Don't throw it away because you are infatuated. Julia is a wonderful woman. You don't even know Yuri Guadalupe. It is not infatuation. I don't know what it is. It's okay. This will happen to you many times. But your bond with Julia is unique. Thanks, man. -Thanks. -Count on me. -I love you, man. -I love you, too. Hi, sweetheart, where were you? Diego is acting very strange, mom. He must be nervous, sweetheart. Men find it harder to bear with marriage. No, he’s... I feel he doesn't want it anymore. Look... Diego knows what you are worth. And he won't find another woman like you. Don't let him forget it. Make all the wedding arrangements. Be supportive and kind. Loving as always. And give him his space. -Okay? -Okay. You'll see, when you are married it will be all right. Okay. -Sure? Very. I am not an engineer, but... these are very big, right? They won't fit. Put them away, Lu shouldn't see them. Put them in this room. - That everything is in order. - Yes. I think it's great. And the friends... I was thinking to put Julia-Diego in this area. -Right. -But I don't know... - Hey. -Hey, handsome! Hi, darling. -How are you? -Darling... Shall your high-school mates be in the same table as the ones from college? Julia and I were thinking... Sofía, we can figure it out. Meanwhile this handsome man can go to rest. -He looks tired. Hey... I'm sorry about yesterday. We both are stressed out. But here I am. And I am very proud of you. I'll go see my dad. Darling, don't forget about the tasting menu. It's the day after tomorrow at 9 a.m. So you and you father can make it. Perfect. Okay. Excuse me. Dany and Vic, move it a bit further. -There? - No, this way. -Okay. - Come on. That's it. Maca. What are you doing here? -Hi, Nico. -Hello. You shouldn't leave the house. I am sick of those four walls and I want to meet the manager. I'll die waiting for you to take her home. This is Maca, my grandma. -Nice to meet you, ma'am. -Call me Maca. My friends call me so. Nice to meet you, Maca. -Are you the one going to China? -Oh, yes. I've travelled all around México. I want to travel the world, see new countries. You will, you'll see. But promise me you will take him with you. She's here with me. He needs to see the world with new eyes. Maca, it was my Dad. You didn't tell him you were coming. -God! -It's okay. I told him you were having dinner with me, then you'll go home. -Good. -Cheers, Maca. -Cheers, sweetheart. Here. -Come on, Nico. -Sweetheart, drink from here. Sweetheart... -Goodbye. -Nice to meet you. -You, too. -See you, Maca. Your place is beautiful. Thanks, I'm glad you came. Yes, take care. She is sick, right? Terminal cancer. I'm surprised she is so lively. She has lived a full life. I wish to be like her when I am old. You already are. Just by having you near I feel I want to see the world through your eyes. I have a surprise for you. Meet me at 5 a.m. in the lobby? -At 5 a.m.? -Yes. -Okay. -Fine. It is what you blindly approved. The power of a building, is that it can last for centuries. Sit down. -It is nearly over, right? -What? -The construction. -Yes. I won't bother you anymore. Do you still think I hate you? Want to know my thoughts about you? That I am a crazy woman with messy hair. -And grumpy. -You keep surprising me. And reminding me how lucky I am. That there is no rush. And I love you. -Get out, Chato! Get out! - I'm sorry, boss. -Come on, get out! -Yeah, yeah. Shit! -Sorry, sir? -Get out already! Yes, boss. I’m running late. Diego. Hey! It's okay. There is no rush. -I'll call you later. Excellent. I'm sorry. - Son! - Where you were you? We are already tasting the dessert. -Are you okay? -Yes. Well, I think lobster is the best main course, right? I liked the T-Bone better. -Yeah? -We can serve both. -Yes. -What do you think, Julia? -Yes, I loved both. - Good. To start... crème brûlée. I have a surprise for you. Let me see. Juli! -They will be on stands tomorrow. - Awesome! - Congratulations. - By the way, your father and I have a surprise for you. Could you come with us after the tasting? Son? Did you hear what your mom said? -Sorry, what? - Son? .I said we have a surprise for you. Would you come with us after the tasting? -Yes. - The crème brûlée is excellent. - You have to try it. - This is wonderful, Juli! - What do you think? - Amazing. - Sit down, son. -Thanks. Everything all right. Darling... we are very proud of you. I am convinced you'll be a great husband and an amazing father. Mom... Your Dad wants to tell you something. Yes. We want to give you your wedding gift right now. It is very important for me that Julia and you have a great future ensured. So I will give you half of the company shares. Darling? I have to tell you something. Could you give us a minute? Sure. I can't get married. What? It is natural to be scared. I am not scared, it's... Please, let me talk. It is natural that you have doubts. But you can't call off the wedding. Besides, Julia is perfect for you. No, dad. She isn't. Don't do this to me. No, please, don't cry. We have given you everything, but above all, we taught you values. You chose that woman! Own your decisions! Come in. You are the most wonderful person I have ever met. And... Sit down. You changed my life. Before I met you... I love you, you are incredible. You drive me crazy. And this is my favorite movie. I want to share it with you. Shall we watch it? Lu! Lu! Emeterio. -Have you seen Lu? -Good morning, sir. -Morning, do you know where is Lu? -Yes. She went to buy coffee. I'm sure she's buying one for you. You are getting married this weekend! Did you think I wouldn't find out? I'm not an idiot! -I won't, I love you. -An asshole like you, doesn't know what love is. Why didn't you tell me? I was going to, I tried. You should have tried harder, asshole. Please, Lu. Let me explain. -Explain? -Come on! What about the bride? Listen to me, let me explain. Let me go. Help me, Chato! Get rid of this idiot. Let her go! Women become deaf when they get mad. What is it, Dad? We can only give her morphine for the pain. What happened? How is she, Dad? Calm down. -Can I see her? -Sure. I'm glad you are here, she was asking about you. Hi. When are we going to China? When you stop scaring us. Have you called off the wedding? Lu hates me. She found out about it in the magazine. She won't see me again. She's completely right. I told you so. Lu doesn't hate you, but you went over the top. Even though you are my favorite grandchild. I am your only grandchild. Do you need anything? Some tea... or vodka? Yes, vodka. -How do you feel, ma'am? -Fine. -Thanks. -I'm glad. Thanks. You know I'll always be there for you, right? Excuse me. I am sorry, your grandma needs to rest. Time for your morphine, ma'am. Yipee! Yipee! It's okay, darling. I hate to see you like this, sweetheart. Here he comes. Lu! Lu is not here. I need to talk with your daughter. -Do you know where I can find her? -Go, please. Please, ma'am. She has to listen to me. I am not like this. I didn't want to hurt anybody, especially not her. I fell in love with her. I did and... I don't want to lose her. -Please, go. -Please, let me talk to her. -I said go. -Please. -Please, go. -Ma'am. -She isn't here. Go! -Ma'am. It's okay, darling. LU, ANSWER, PLEASE. How handsome! I can tell you are very excited about the wedding. You aren't coming, right? Grandma. Go get dressed. You don't want to be late for your own wedding. See you later. Diego! The only person who has to live with the decision you are about to make, is you. Not your mom, nor your dad. Not anybody else, but you. It is never too late. Here you are. Julia is here and you aren't ready. Where is she? In the dining room. But get dressed first. It looks beautiful. See? You inspired the engineer. I'm sorry, boss. Lu, why do you have to go to China? There are no avocados there and nobody dances danzón. Stay, Lu. You’re by far the the most gorgeous boss we’ve ever had. Chatito! I meant as a person. THANKS A LOT, MY FRIEND! I KNOW IF YOU COULD... Why aren't you dressed? Go! Please, go! What is it? What's going on? Listen, Yuri Guadalupe, there are people worth fighting for. He may be one of them. Everybody deserves a second chance. You know that. I will miss you, mommy. Besides, Chinese food is awful. Lu! Lu! Please, Emeterio, tell me the truth. -She went to China. -Won't you help me out? All right. She went to China. Emeterio, please, help me. Hold on, sir. Hotel Azul, good night. -Thanks. -What a temper! I'm sorry. Diego! No! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, wrong wedding. I'm sorry! No, you aren't wrong. I'm sorry! It is our wedding. Hold on. Just a second. Thanks. Please, forgive me. Come on! Hey... Enough! This is our wedding! Hey! Over here! Hey! Enough already! It is our wedding. Enough! Stop it! Over here! It's enough! This is our wedding. I'm sorry, congratulations. - Congratulations. -Thank you. Go on! AND THEN I MET YOU -Be a good girl, sweetheart. -Yes, Mom. Yuri Guadalupe, why did you pack in separate suitcases? Because I like it that way. -Have you got the passport? -Don't you have it? No, I don't. Where did you put it? -Relax! -Well, let's go. I'll give you my blessing, too. -Take care of her. -Of course, ma'am. -I love you, mommy. -I love you, too. -See you, let's go. -Give me a kiss. -Bye, mommy. -Have fun! Look what I found. -Shall we light them up? -Yeah. Me first. No, you will mess up. I won't mess up! I'm not the engineer's blonde friend... Engineer, engineer... EXPLOSIVES Holy crap! -Damn it! -Damn it!
