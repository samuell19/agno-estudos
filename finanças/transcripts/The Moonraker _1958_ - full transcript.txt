(dramatic music) - Dawlish. - Sire? - The devil take it. My horse has cast a shoe. - There's a village over the brow. - You think it's wise? This part of the country's strong for Cromwell. - Well, we can't go on with a lame horse. - Hardly. (gentle music) Smithy? - Aye aye sir. - Smithy, my man's horse has cast a shoe. - Aye aye sir, I'll see to it. - As quick as you can. - You traveled far? - Far enough. When the horse is finished, bring her across to the inn. - I'll do that, sir. - By the Parliament a proclamation Charles Stuart, £1000. - By the Parliament a proclamation The Moonraker, £100. (chuckles) - Consider that a true estimation of your value, Dawlish? - On the whole, no Sire. - I see they've been a little more generous in my case. - No, sire. - My Lords. - Landlord! - Morning gentlemen. - Some wine, Landlord. And a jug of ale for the servant. - Much too good for him. - Aye aye, sir. - Sire. (ominous music) - Thank you. - One of my first acts after my restoration Dawlish, will be to order you to drink a whole barrel of this stuff. - It would be a pleasure, sire. - Landlord! - Yes? - Two troops of dragoons under Captain Macey will be here within the hour. We need stabling and shelter for 60 horses and men. - Sarah! - What are two troops of dragoons doing here, Corporal? - What business is that of yours? - None. Have some wine. - Thirsty work, hunting down the royalists. Praise the Lord, there're not many of them left now. And once we've caught Charles Stewart, there's only one of those likely to give us any trouble. - Oh, who's that? - The Moonraker. I'd give a month's pay to come face to face with him. - The Lord be with you if that day ever comes, Corporal. - £1000 for Charles Stewart's head. I wouldn't offer tuppence. Though mind you, I wouldn't say no to £1000 if it came my way. - Corporal? - Are you sure? - Aye, I'd stake me life on it. Yep, they've a way of setting a shoe in Worcester you wouldn't find anywhere else in the whole of England. And what's more, the other shoes were set in different counties. I tell you, this horse has traveled a long way in the past few weeks, and over some rough country. Any blacksmith'll tell you that by looking at its feet. Here, who do you think it might be? The King? - What was that you said? - Sorry Corporal, Charles Stewart I mean, slip of the tongue. - We must leave at once. - Four weeks since the Battle of Worcester. Plenty of time and more to get this far. And the description fits too. Pale skin, long nose, about two yards high. - Have you any food here? - Yes, sir. There's a roast already in the oven, if you'd like to wait a while. It'll be ready in under an hour. - We'll sharpen our appetites on some more wine. - The troops can't be far away now, I can get them here in half that time. - Here, the reward Corporal, the £1000 you won't forget? It was me that told you. - Walk. Ride straight to Sir Nigel's, I'll meet you there. - Come on! (dramatic music) (gun fires) - Miller and White, look after him. The rest, follow me! (dramatic music) (shouting) - General Cromwell wishes to see you, sir. (shouting) - [Man] Take fire! (guns firing) - Well, Colonel Beaumont. Have you read Macey's report on the killing of the trooper? - Yes sir. I imagine that it is once again the work of this man they call The Moonraker. - During the past two years, he's murdered over 20 of our best troops. And even worse, during the same period, has spirited away 33 royalists to France. Some of them from under our very noses. You realize that? - Only too well, sir. - What do you make of the blacksmith's statement? - That the servant was Charles Stewart. In the same week he was recognized in Carlisle, in Shrovesbury and in Winchester. - True, but in this case, there are circumstances to support the claim. Charles Stewart is the only man for whom The Moonraker would risk all. Why should he suddenly take such a chance in broad daylight, unless to prevent the trooper from passing on vital information? Major Greg is in no doubt that the servant was Charles Stewart. He's also convinced that it's The Moonraker who's been protecting him and planning his escape from the start. And Greg's opinion must be given due weight. - Major Greg is no true friend of ours, sir. - What do you mean by that? - We do not fight the devil with the devil's weapons. - His method's may be a trifle unorthodox, but he has never failed us yet. - No sir. - Colonel Beaumont, I'm strengthening the garrison at Bodiam and placing you in command. Take eight squadrons of horses and turn the southern counties upside down if need be to prevent the escape of Charles Stewart. - Very well, sir. - I prefer also to make use of Greg's services. He as usual, will work alone. - Thank you for that, sir. - At the moment he's in the West Country at Exeter. He will join you at Bodiam. (knocking) Enter. - This has just been delivered, sir. - Listen to this. It's from The Moonraker. "General Cromwell, "Whilst riding through a troop of your model army, "I had the leisure to read your proclamation. "I return it to you in the hope that the last days "have enhanced my reputation, "and that the weighty affairs of state "will leave you time enough to revise "your opinion of my worth." We've got to teach that man a lesson, Colonel. He and every other royalist in this country must be made to realize that they're not dealing with a pack of fools! - Indeed, sir. - Leave for Bodiam immediately. - Yes, sir. - And may the Lord of hosts go with you. (drumming) - This house doth declare that all persons, whether English or Scots, who have or shall adhere to, or assist the traitor known as The Moonraker. (murmuring) The penalty for aiding and abetting this enemy of the commonwealth is death. For information leading to his capture, the existing reward of £100 has been increased to one of £500. Signed, Oliver Cromwell, Lord General, Hampton Court. (dramatic music) - Captain Foster. - Sir. - This is your area of the coast. Concentrate mainly on the coast road and all isolated houses, farms and inns in particular. Flamborough Manor, Moor Farm, Windwhistle Inn, Spendrith Farm. We suspect that The Moonraker has friends in this area, who will give him shelter and food and fresh horses when necessary. - Yes, sir. - You wanted to see me, sir? - Yes. Tell the Quarter Master to leave a room free in the officer's building. - Very good, sir. - Say it's for Major Greg. - Yes, sir. - Captain Wilcox? - Yes, sir. - This is your area. Set up pickets at intervals of 10 miles. Keep them hidden as far as possible and move them every two days. Send out patrols. All travelers must be stopped, questioned and searched. - Yes, sir. - No-one is to move more than five miles from home without a permit. Now, gentlemen, may God go with you. - Let me have the man who built this coach within the length of his arm. To ask a civilized human being, a gentleman of quality to sit for 10 solid hours in this flea-ridden, bone rattling contraption, and then to be stopped every two miles by these wooly-brained misbegotten sniveling round heads! - Sir, must we have all that again? - I don't understand it, sire. In time of peace. - What of our names? Our political opinions? Have we got The Moonraker hidden under the seats! - Who is this Moonraker, sir? - The cavalier's arm, the last of 'em. - And what does the word Moonraker mean? - It's the Wiltshire name for a smuggler's arm. They hide their contraband in the village pond and rake it out by moonlight. A fitting name for someone who rakes cavaliers from the round head muck ponds. They say he stood beside the scaffold in White Hall the day King Charles was beheaded. He vowed there and then that every night when the moon was full, a round head should pay for the life of the King. - I have no politics, Mr. Parfitt, but I do object to murder. (bright music) (dramatic music) - Right, outside everybody. - Look here, we've had just about enough! - You'd be well advised to hold your tongue. - Oh I should, Mr. Parfitt. These men can get a little rough. - Your name, Madam. - Anne Wyndham, traveling to Bodiam. - Purpose? - To visit my future husband, Colonel Beaumont. - I'm sorry to have troubled you, Madam. Are you traveling alone? - With my maid. - Your name? - Tyler, Edmund. - Church? - Glastonbury. - Persuasion? - Anglican. - Destination? - Bodiam. - Purpose? - I have to report to the puritan commission there. - What the blazes do you think you're doing? - And what's your name? - Parfitt. - Occupation? - Gentleman. - Destination and purpose? - Bodiam, riotous living. - It may be as well to inform you Mr. Parfitt that disrespect to officers of the army-- - May I inform you, sir that I have no respect for officers of your army! Nor do I have any respect for the puritan commission, the round head party, Hampton Court, the houses of parliament or Oliver Cromwell! - Had we no other business in hand, Mr. Parfitt, I'd have you flogged and kept in the pilary. You run your mouth again, I will! Raise the barrier. Get moving. - The big house, Captain. - Well what about it? - Well I saw two gentlemen and a servant, they came out before us and crept up the house. I know wrongun's when I see 'em. - Sergeant. - Sir? - Corporal? - Sir? - Your men come with me, the rest stay here. (birds singing) - Have we much further to travel, Dawlish? - Not much further, Your Majesty. We're within a few hours of the sea. If you and Harcourt remain here, I will ride on and see if I can charter a ship. - Where shall we meet you then? - At Windwhistle Inn. It's on the coast road, three miles west of Shoreham. I'd like you to be there before daybreak, four o'clock. - Surely the inn's a dangerous place to meet? - The landlord was in service with my family. And he's loyal to your cause, sire. (dramatic music) - Hey, sir! You take the west wing, Corporal? - Sir? - You take the east wing. I'll take the north and south. Troop, forward! (dramatic music) - It's very good of you my Lord, to offer us your hospitality. And so much risk to yourself and your family. Such friends are few nowadays. - Sire, it is an honor which future generations of my family will cherish above all others. (dramatic music) - Round head troopers, surrounding the house my Lord! - I'll court the King. - Come, sire. - Is there another way out? - This way, through the posters. Here, Your Majesty. - Forgive me. My troubles make me forget myself. I thank you both. Till we meed again, Lord Dorset. - For God's sake sire, hurry! (dramatic music) (banging) Step on it. (gun fire) - Search the house! - To what, sir do we owe this unwarranted intrusion? - Where are your guests? - We have no guests. Unless my wife has invited someone without my knowledge. - No dearest, cousin Marion cannot come until next week, I thought I told you. - We have information that you received three men in here less than an hour ago. - Then I fear you have been misinformed. (tense music) - I'll be your sword, sire. (dramatic music) - Look out, sire! All right, I'll take this one. - Harcourt! Thank you, this way. (tense music) (grunting) - Come on, sire! - They fight well, Harcourt. Pity they're not on our side. - We'll take them. Come, sire! (gun fires) (dramatic music) (shouting) - All right! - Stay deep in the forest until nightfall. It's 12 miles to the inn, you've got to be there by four o'clock. When you come up to the gibbet, take a left fork. I'll see you there. I'm going to arrange the ship. (dramatic music) - Welcome, ladies. Welcome, gentlemen. - Thank you. - This way, ladies. This way, gentlemen. Welcome to Windwhistle Inn. - Landlord, please bring some madeira to warm us. - Certainly, Ma'am. Oh yes, sir. - Pray take the fella, pray take him I say! Why can't he draw up to the door? - It's more convenient for the baggage, sir. - Blast the baggage, who are you sir? - The landlord. - Oh, good. Now, bring me some brandy. - Directly, sir. (coughing) - Supper'll be ready shortly, Ma'am. - And about time too. - What made the coach so late, Ma'am? - Oh, we were stopped and questioned several times by troopers. - Oh, why? Do you know why? - They're looking for The Moonraker. - Judith. Our guests want their supper. - Landlord! Where's me brandy? - Just coming, sir. ♪ And I will cherish you ♪ ♪ All else above ♪ ♪ Oh come with me ♪ ♪ My turtledove ♪ - Martin, I've told you before not to sing that song. - Sorry Mother, I forgot. - The lad's doing no harm, Judith. - It's his song. I can't listen to it. - Judith, for two months we haven't seen or heard a thing. - Until tonight. And if he rides up to that door, you'll help him as you've always done, won't you Henry? A rebel, a man with a price on his head. I'll walk this kitchen till morning, knowing that a slip would send you to the scaffold. I can't go through it again, Henry. I can't I tell you. (dramatic music) - It's The Moonraker sir, I'm sure of it! - Well, get after him! Go on then! - Right. (gun fires) (tense music) - And where's Charles Stewart, eh? Tell me that! At large in the country since Worcester, and 10,000 of them can't find him! - Sir, as landlord-- - Who's that? - My son, Martin. - Hmm, I say, bit weedy. - Father, he's here, he's in the yard. - Tell him to come in. (whistling) - Good evening, Henry. - My Lord. - Martin, your Father and I have business to discuss. So off with you. - Must I? - Yes. Go on, off you go. - I've got company in the house, Lord. A Bodiam coach, four passengers. - Where are they? - In their rooms. - Henry, I have the most urgent need of a ship, to take two friends and myself to France. I've asked them to meet me here tomorrow at first light, at four o'clock. - You couldn't have come at a worse time, my Lord. - Oh? - Smith is at sea. And Marlow, Marlow is in irons at Shoreham jail. They caught him, putting to sea with two royalists aboard. - Then we must find somebody else, that's all. It is a matter of the greatest importance. I repeat Henry, the greatest importance. - Captain Lowry might do it. He's not above a bit of smuggling. And he knows the tides and the bay here as well as any man. This'll be a very different kettle of fish, though. I cannot be sure whether he would undertake it. - Then we must persuade him. - My Lord, you're wounded. - Yes. I had a skirmish with some round heads a mile or two back. - Well then they'll be here my Lord. They'll search every wood, barn and house within miles! - No doubt of it, Henry. No doubt at all. ♪ Oh come with me my turtledove ♪ ♪ Oh come with me and be my love ♪ ♪ You are my life my guiding star ♪ ♪ For me true paradise is where you are ♪ ♪ Oh come with me ♪ ♪ Be mine alone ♪ ♪ I give my heart to be your own ♪ ♪ And I will cherish you all else above ♪ ♪ Oh come with me my turtledove ♪ Ah, there we are Henry. A puritan from head to foot. And may God forgive their tailors. - Where the purple pig is this supper? Ready in ten minutes says half an hour ago. You country hovels are all the same, every one of them! Can't get a meal on the table when you want it. Not even if you're dying of hunger. - I'll see about your supper now. - Hmm, I have the patience of a saint. Well sir? I said, well sir! - Why, I beg your pardon. The weather continues, doesn't it? - Blast the weather, who are you sir? - My name is Rice. Thomas Rice. - How did you get here? - On a horse. - Ooh, you can ride, can you? - Just jog along. - And where have you just jogged from? - Trull. - And what pray sir do you do in Trull? - I do not do, sir. I reflect. I am a scholar. I lead a contemplative life. - And what pray sir do you contemplate? - Aristotle. - Unacquainted sir, and likely to remain so. - He draws distinctions between good and evil. - Ah, so do I sir, so do I. All cavaliers are good, all round heads are evil. - I cannot accept that proposition. - Then I'll offer you another sum. Petition to the parliament and damnation to their cause! - I really must ask you to moderate your language. - I would ask you sir to observe this sword. Specially designed to put an end to contemplation! - Landlord! - Have no fear sir, you and I are friends. We are in fact, about to drink a toast together. - But I don't drink! - I can assault you sir. A toast, repeated after me. To the future King of England, His Majesty, God bless him, King Charles the Second! - I must decline! - To your feet! You refuse do you? Then allow me to inform you that manners are on the fence, your clothes are an eyesore, and your outlook an abomination! - Harsh words, Mr. Parfitt. - An unmannerly costume, sir. - Won't you introduce me? - No. - Then allow me to introduce myself. The name is Tyler. - I am afraid that I have annoyed your friend. - He's had a trying day. Parfitt, we'll drink a brandy together and leave this gentleman to his book. - Oh, thank you. - Contemplation! - I'm glad to see you're a supporter of General Cromwell. We're in the minority here, you know. - I didn't know. Do you dislike cavaliers? - I hate them. - Pardon my saying so, Ma'am, but I cannot believe that someone as beautiful as you could hate anybody. - Five men gather the horses, the rest come with me. Search the place, men. You're Henry Strangeways, landlord of this inn? - I am. - These people are your guests? - They are. - Anything wrong, Madam? - You must forgive my wife, sir. She's not feeling very well. - When did they arrive? - Four of them arrived half an hour ago by coach from Exeter. - Miss Wyndham and maid? Mr. Parfitt, pastor Edmund Tyler? No other visitors? - Mr Rice of Trull, journeying to Bridport. - Show me a permit of travel. - Yes sir. - When'd you get here? - 10 minutes ago. - Has he complied with the regulations and signed his name? - Well, no sir-- - Well see that he does so straight away! You know the law. - Yes, sir. Come this way please, Mr. Rice. - How did he get here? - On a horse. Mangy looking creature too, I'll be bound. - Where is it? - In the stable, Captain. It's a bay mare. (horse neighs) (knocking) - Stand up. Turn round. Well, is this the man? - No. This man's like him, but The Moonraker was broader in build and taller. - Have your guests had their supper yet? - You hear that priest? The man's a humorous! - No sir, not yet. - Serve it at once, and after see they go to their rooms and stay there. No-one's to leave this inn, that's an order. - Very well, Captain. - May we ask why, Captain? - We have reason to believe The Moonraker's in this neighborhood. - Judith. - An unpleasant business. - Most. Do you think that we're in any danger? - Not me sir, do you hear? Not me. This Moonraker doesn't rail against royalists. His speciality is chicken livered, mealy mouthed, pig-headed puritan scum! - Mr. Parfitt, that will do. - That will do, sire, for the moment. - I think that that man has royalist sympathies. Do you think that we should have informed the Captain? - I think the Captain, Mr. Rice has already guessed. - Trooper Bell, hide yourself in the east trees and keep a watch on the inn. - You lied to me. - I did not. - You knew he was coming. - I swear not. And this will be the last time. - This time they will catch him. Have you thought what's gonna happen to Martin and me then? - How are you, Judith? - My Lord. - Our guests are waiting for their supper, Judith. - No, Henry. I'm going alone. Your place is with your wife. - Is there nothing I can do, my Lord? - Have a bottle of your best claret ready for my return. - God speed. - I waited till the troopers had gone, before bringing him to the stable like you told me. Then I fed him and brushed him. - You're a good lad, Martin. (dramatic music) (laughing and talking) - A jug of ale. Captain Lowry here tonight? - That will be a tuppence, sir. - Thank you. Captain Lowry? Your name was given to me by a Mr. Strangeways, landlord of the Windwhistle Inn. He said you could help me in a matter of some urgency. As it concerns my own personal safety, I'd like your assurance that you won't say anything about it. - You either trust me or you don't. - Very well. I want a passage to France, for myself, my friend and a servant, tomorrow at dawn. - You won't get it from me. - I'll pay you £50. That's more than you would earn in a dozen cargo trips. - Maybe, but if I put out tomorrow without a cargo, there'd be more than one around here be only too glad to drop a word in the right quarter. If that happened, I'd be lucky if all I lost was my ship. Suppose for instance, you and your friends turned out to be three royalists, friends of the King? I'd find myself hanging from a gibbet. - So that's it? Strangeways told me that you were a man of spirit. - I'll take a chance on the next man. But I'm not risking my neck for a miserable £50. If you said £100 now-- - All right. £100 it is. - It's a bargain, then. What time do you want to leave? - Anchor off Windwhistle Inn and come ashore one hour before dawn. Strangeways will be there to meet you. - See that he is. I don't want my ship lying in that bay any longer than need be. - You shan't have time to watch the sun rise. - Till tomorrow then. - And what brings you here, Mr. Rice? - I beg your pardon? Oh, Trooper. I just came in to find a relative of mine, an old aunt who lives in the town. - Well, you disobeyed Captain Foster's orders. - Oh, I didn't mean to be disrespectful to Captain Foster. I'll go back now. - That's what you think, you're coming with me! A night in the local jail'll teach you not to take our orders so lightly in future. - I think you ought to drink your ale first, Corporal. (screaming) (shouting) - [Henry] Judith, I've got to help. The Strangeways owe a lot to the Dawlish family. And well you know it. - All right, if you don't value your own neck, think of Martin. It's only natural for a boy of his age to worship a man like that! The stories that are spread about him, the very name, Moonraker! - Judith. For heaven's sake, will you keep your voice down! He'll be gone by morning. I promise. And for good this time. Now be a good lass. Stop worrying. You go and see to the warming pans. - Nothing I can do or say'll shake you from this loyalty will it, Henry? - Meg, come quickly, bring your cloak! I want you to take this to Colonel Beaumont immediately. You can take one of the horses from the stable. Oh, Mr. Rice! Mr. Rice, I must speak to you. It's all right, come in. I have information vital to our cause. - Oh, what is it? - The Moonraker is here. - He is? Where? - I only know the landlord is his accomplice, and that he's somewhere in this house. - Who is he? - I don't know yet. (knocking) - Oh, my Lord Dawlish, forgive me, I-- - That's all right, Judith. I am sorry you had to hear that. - That you are The Moonraker? - Yes. - I'm not afraid of you. I hate you for the murderer you are. If I could bring you one step nearer the scaffold, I would. - Unfortunately, you will never have the opportunity. Miss Wyndham, may I pour you some wine? The landlord is my accomplice. Mr. Parfitt is sympathetic to my cause. Pastor Tyler has no reason to interfere. The servants are asleep. This room is an island in the night, with me as your companion. (tense music) - Parfitt. Thomas Rice. - I always wondered what it must feel like to be a murderer. - Then you must ask one. - You deny you killed a trooper last week? - I had no choice, it was his life, or that of my friends. But not murder. - What about this vow of yours? To kill one of our soldiers at every full moon. - That yarn. I spread it about to keep the troopers scared. I prefer to save life, not take it. - Royalist lives. There are precious few left. - Quite. So I'm thinking of retiring. I dream of my lands, my dogs, a glowing fire, a glass of wine. - Dreams, Lord Dawlish. Face reality! Our army have sworn to hunt you down. You'll be caught, and you'll receive no mercy. - I expect none. I don't expect to be caught, either. This is an unwarranted intrusion, Pastor Tyler. - The name is Greg, not Pastor Tyler. Major Greg. A name that may not be unknown to you. - I have heard of it in some discreditable connection. - You will find my reputation is deserved. - May we come to the point? - You are charged with the wanton murder of Trooper Darcett. - The defense of another life, Greg. - A life of no consequence. Murder on the highway ranks you as a highway man. From here, you'll be taken to Newgate prison. In three days, you will be tried and executed the day following. - An agreeably short program of events, don't you think? I hate these long, drawn out affairs. May I know more about the entertainment? - It will be all you deserve. You may depend on us. - I hope I may. Made a mess of the late King's execution. The streets were impassable, the clergy were late, ladies couldn't see-- - The ladies will have every chance to feast their eyes when your body is cut down at tieman. - Cut down? - Naturally. - You cannot draw and quarter a man who is still swinging on the end of a rope. Very inconvenient. - Very. I hope you will find the spectacle amusing, Miss Wyndham. - I should not want anyone to die like that. - Not even me? - Not even you. - I wouldn't let it worry you. (dramatic music) - Move it on, Dawlish! And again. Why wait for tieman to see you die? No. It would be selfish to deprive so many people of their amusements. But I'm tempted. Sorely tempted. - You all right, my Lord? - Thank you, Henry. - Well, who is he, my Lord? - Someone we've known of for a long time. Major Greg. - Then we'd better finish him now then. - No, his day of reckoning will come. Put him in the cellar. - Let me help you, Lord Dawlish. - That's very kind of you. - I would do the same for anyone. (gentle music) - Do you live in Bodiam? - I'm going to visit my future husband, Colonel Beaumont. - Beaumont? The most feared man in Cromwell's army. - He's a good soldier. It's his duty to keep discipline. - And to hunt down his enemies as pitilessly as he did after Worcester. - By what right do you criticize a man for believing in his cause and fighting for it? - None. I do that myself. But I try and remember that my enemies are human. - How dare you insinuate Colonel Beaumont is capable of cruelty! You and all royalists have such a high regard for yourself. You think all the good in the world, all the right is on your side. Someone doesn't agree with you, you sneer at him and attack him with insults and lies. John Beaumont has qualities beyond the understanding of a man like you. Strength of purpose. Dignity. Humility. Have you humility, my Lord? - I'm rapidly acquiring it, Miss Wyndham. If I have offended you, please forgive me. I have the greatest respect for Colonel Beaumont as a soldier. - Hold up your arm. - How did you come to know him? - He and my Father were friends. They served in the same regiment. - You can't have seen much of him in the last months. - Half the battle of Worcester, I stayed with him and his sister in London for a while. He was very busy. - Naturally. - In the mornings, he worked in the study. In the afternoons, he went to Hampton Court for conference with General Cromwell. - Every afternoon? - No. He took me once to see a review of his regiment in White Hall. And we went several times to hear Mr. Milton speak at St Paul's Cross. - How did you spend the evenings? - He was usually rather busy, I tried not to disturb him. Though sometimes I played the spinet. - Oh, he's fond of music? - No. It sends him to sleep. Oh, you're amused at that? - No. Such virtues win civil wars. - How would you spend your day? - You mean, how are wars lost? Well, in the morning, I'd take my lady riding. Through the trees. I'd watch the wind caress her hair. I'd see her racing in front of me, laughing and happy. Then we'd hear the music and the noise of the fair. Pass a dancing bear on the road. Would you like that, Anne? - Oh yes. - I'll take you to see the tumblers. I'll watch you hold your breath as two jugglers run a race with clubs on their noses. Would you be very angry with me when you saw that I was laughing at you? - Yes, very. - Then with great skill, I'll win you a mirror. And when you look into it, your anger'll fade. And in the sun and smile of that crowd, in the jostle and the noise, I would tell you that I loved you. (romantic music) - I wish to see Colonel Beaumont at once. - I'm sorry Miss, he's just retired and left word that he's not to be disturbed. - But I have a message from his future wife, Miss Wyndham. There's not a moment to lose! - Dawlish's landmark. (dramatic music) (tense music) (dramatic music) - Will you answer a question? - If I can. - Why are you going to marry John Beaumont? - He needs me. To be needed means a great deal to a woman. - Not everything, Anne. Don't you ever long for a tender smile from somebody who doesn't care what creed you hold, what you are or what you've been? Who just knows that you exist and that you're beautiful? - To love only beauty is vanity and emptiness. - No, Anne. One day, when cavaliers and round heads are forgotten, your mind will come back to this room, and our last few hours together, will seem more real than a war that's won and lost. - I think they may. But there's something you've forgotten. Tonight that war is more real. And it's not just something outside these walls. It's here with us in this room. A year ago, my Father was killed by cavaliers. My brother too. In that hour I swore I would hate all of them until the last was destroyed. You are the last. Tell me you understand. - I understand. - That was very gallant. (romantic music) (knocking) - It's Henry, my Lord. - Yes, Henry? - Lowry's here and in a hurry to be gone. - What time is it? - It's 15 minutes to four my Lord. - Has anybody else arrived yet? - No, my Lord. - All right Henry, give me a minute. I must go. - Perhaps even now there's something I can do for you. Wherever you're going, go quickly. - Why? - There are troopers on their way from Bodiam to arrest you. - Troopers? But Greg and yourself are the only two people who know I'm here. - No, I sent my maid with a letter some hours ago. - Why are you trying to save my life? - Because I-- because you've taught me how to laugh again. Brought me happiness I didn't know existed. Now for pity's sake, go. (romantic music) Will I ever see you again? - I don't know. Between this room and the road are swords. Between the road and the sea, there may be death for me. - If you reach the sea? - If I reach the sea, we'll meet again. Captain Lowry, where are you going? - Well, I can wait no longer. The tide's on the turn! - But you can give us a few minutes grace? - No, I don't like the smell of this. I'll be off. That won't get you to France. - Oh, but your ship will. - Now, Dawlish, you set us a pretty puzzle to find this inn. - Thank God you're here. - A moment. This man is no servant. His bearing betrays him. I know well who it is. I served in his Father's navy. I've seen the lad before. - So, Captain Lowry, it is the King. Our bargain still holds. - But the risk I shall be taking! - You increase the risk every second you wait here. - Charles Stewart is worth £1000 to Cromwell. His passage to France must be worth at least as much. My ship worth £400 may be lost. And for extra cargo, say £500. - £1900? - We've nothing like that sum. - Your Majesty, I'm a poor man and you ask me to take a great risk. But I'm also a patient man. I'll wait for my money until the people of England come to their senses and welcome you back as their King! God speed the day. - Amen. - That day will surely come. And you shall have the sum you asked for with interest. (hooves clattering) - Sire, the ship! - Follow me, Your Majesty! - They've come for us, I shall cover your escape! (tense music) - Going somewhere, Mr. Rice? - Nowhere in particular. - Captain. Everyone in the house is under arrest. - Good. - Ask Miss Wyndham to come down here. - Find Miss Wyndham, bring her down here. - Open up these shutters, this place is like a tomb. Search the inn. (dramatic music) (knocking) - Houston, quick, in here! (dramatic music) - Anne. I'm so proud of you. Now, come on, where is he? - I-- - Well, where is he? - John, I'm afraid you're too late. The, he-- The man I suspected, he left about half an hour-- - Well, which way did he go? - I don't know, I just heard him gallop off. - Your ears must be playing you tricks this morning, Miss Wyndham. As well as your eyes. Good morning, Colonel Beaumont. - Greg. What the devil do you mean by letting this man slip through your fingers? - I haven't. Have I Miss Wyndham? - What do you mean? - It grieves me to rob you of it. But I think this moment belongs to me. Anthony, Earl of Dawlish. The Moonraker. Well Colonel, call your escort, I'm impatient to be gone. - Are you sure? The way through that door does not lead to the honorable and swift dispatch of the headman's ax. It leads to the gallows, to the death of a common highway man. Tell me where Charles Stewart is, and your life is spared. - Since when has my life been worth that of a King's? - Deliver him to me, man. Save your soul. - I cannot deliver him to you. But I can show you where he is. - You accept? - I accept. - Stand by, the main sail up! - Keep your blasted hands off me, what is this? It's one darn thing after another! What's going on here? Can't a man sleep in peace? - Who is this man? - Who the blazes are you, sir? And what's all this rabble? I paid for board and lodging, not to be routed out half the night by preggy ironside, where's the landlord? - The landlord and his wife are under arrest. - What for? - For sheltering a royalist. - Sir, I am honored. - Not you, you fool. Mr. Rice of Trull. - That nincompoop? - Lord Dawlish, The Moonraker. - Captain Foster, bring in the landlord and his wife. - Sir. - Colonel, you have a sense of the ridiculous. The landlord, my accomplice? - It's a lie! We're against The Moonraker and all he stands for. - Then perhaps you tell me who it was that knocked me senseless? Who else could it have been, if it wasn't your husband? Unless of course it was Miss Wyndham here. (laughing) - You find all this amusing? - Nothing in this company sir, would amuse me. But that this murrey minded, shuffling bumpkin would help him to do such a thing, man can't even draw a pint of beer properly. And as for Miss Wyndham, do you really think a woman's arm could crack so thick a skull as yours? If you're really anxious to know who the accomplice is, I can assist you. I am he. - Then no doubt you were the first to greet our friend here when he first arrived. - Oh, yes, yes, yes, a handing glove for the fella. - What was he wearing? - Same moth-eaten clobber all you puritan nincompoops wear. - Then perhaps you can tell us what happened to the cavalier dress he was known to be wearing before he got here? - Threw it over the cliff. - We've only your word for all this. - My words though was good enough for the late King, it'll more than do for someone who wasn't fit to be his subject! - Mr. Parfitt, you're under arrest. - It'll be a pleasure, sir. - You may also have the pleasure of joining your friend on the gallows. - And a damn handsome pair we'll make. - And the landlord and his wife? - The landlord and his wife can go. - Oh, thank you sir. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, sir. - Your wife is waiting for you. - Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye, landlord. - Captain Foster? - Sir. - Have your men ready to leave. - Very good, sir. - Anne, I want to talk to you. Anne. A few minutes ago, I was proud and happy, that you, my future wife should be responsible for delivering one of the greatest enemies of the commonwealth into our hands. And now you try to shield him. - I can't expect you to understand. - What have you done? - I gave him the chance to escape. I told him there was a squadron of troopers on their way here. - Why, Anne? Why? Did he threaten you into helping him to escape? Was that what happened? - No, it wasn't like that. He was very kind and gentle. He talked of things you never talk of. Things you haven't time for. - I see. - I know that sounds cruel and ungrateful. - No, it's the truth. I have thought about the great cause which we're fighting. And forgotten, that for a woman, that is not enough. - What are you going to do with me? - You have left me no alternative. - You mean, I'm your prisoner. - Yes. - I understand. - Lord Dawlish, you will come with me. I hold you to our bargain. Show me, where is Charles Stewart? - Colonel, there is the King. - You fool, Greg! Foster! (dramatic music) - Come on, down here! (knocking) (shouting) - Come on, Parfitt, come on! - All right, my Lord. (dramatic music) God save the King! (screaming) - Send down to Osman, ride to the galley. They can get down to the beach from there. - Aye aye, sir. Follow me, men! (dramatic music) Follow me, men! (water splashes) (gentle music) (bright music) (water splashes) (triumphant music) - I am ready to leave, John. - You are free to go, wherever you please. To join him if you will. - I don't understand. - Charles Stewart has escaped. Your arrest would serve no other purpose than revenge. - John. - Go, Anne. You will never see me again. Goodbye.
