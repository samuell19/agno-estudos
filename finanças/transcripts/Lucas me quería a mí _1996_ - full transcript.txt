I have a happy heart, I have a happy heart I have a happy heart since that moment you came to me... I thank life and ask God you never let me down. I'd like you to know. that I never loved him like that, my life began when I met you. You are like the morning sun shining through my window, shining through my window. Is a pleasure. Thank you Tutankhamen and friends. There is no need to applaud. I'm used to the undead, apathy towards this fascinating world of showbiz. Thanks. Estrella, please don't start. Shut up and put on Karaoke. It's all they understand. I hope they choke! Come on, honey, let's sing. Don't be like that, you're getting better. Getting better? I'm tired of my husband, the children and the Japanese who invented Karaoke. Really, Toni, I never liked japanese people even in the 70's "Empire of the senses", or now. And you know that the erotic universe excites me a lot. So where did you get that bike from, tell me! Careful, if it hears it will be unbearable. That damn karaoke invaded my profession. There is no audience. Everyone wants to be a singer thanks to that fucking machine. That kind of thing that destroys the balance between supply and demand. Everyone wants to be the star and that's not enough! Yes, what about the digital alarm clocks? - What about the futons? - What are you saying about me? I must have taken acid the day I married you. Honey, don't treat the audience rudely, you're a professional. Don't call it an audience, Miguel! we have done good Shows for pedestrians. - You are right. - I don't think you agree. I know you say that just so you don't argue. I'm going to check the organ. That's right! Check your organ! Hide behind your Yamaha. He is as closed as a vault. So are you going to tell me about last night? Oh, Toni! he had a dick like a bottle of Coke. You know I'm not a limb addict. But how he knew how to manage! It's not like this one... Don't be so hard on Miguel. Well, after so long, it's not the same. We become obsessed with having a stable relationship, but soon it all falls apart. Listen, you like Miguel, don't you? No way! He is your husband and I I play fair with my friends' husbands. It doesn't matter if he is married. If you like, you like and that's the end of it. "Cocoon", Senior Karaoke. Hello?! Do you have to say that every time you answer? No, but it's funny. Are you at the agency? No, I'm on the second round Listen, I called Carlos. Dani, the lady of the house called. She is kicking us out because we owe her. - She can't kick out for 2 months. - I warned you, but you never listen. She is homophobic and the contract lasts until next month... Don't get hysterical. After the laundry, come to my house and we'll find a solution. Yes, please, please find a solution. Hey, aren't you forgetting...? Let's meet at home after he leaves the laundromat and I told him to call you for the same reason. - I finish work at eleven. - Don't be late, then. Aren't you forgetting something? No, what do you mean? Nothing... See you at home. Is this the square that Ana Belén sings about? No, ma'am. This is the Toleto Portal. Ana Belén's is from Alcalá. All aboard! We have a lot to see! Hurry up! He's coming in. Surprise! What a surprise! Who said? fake! You've been running away from your birthday all week. Make a wish! Congratulations to you, on this date dear That's what we wish you, Dani ... Alright, we all will be. Now, your gift. - A gift? - Yes. - No! - Yes! Gift! - No! - Yes! Here it is! Look look! Best wishes. Is there a lot of music? Yes, I have a tape... from Estrella... Take it all! Take it all! How tasty! Hooker! He's taking everything! - Go! - Go! - Go... What it was? I don't want to take my clothes off. All right, please. Sorry, I guess I could, but... I can't, I can't. I want to go away. True, I'm an electrician. But since I became unemployed... and I just got married... I only did it once, but with girls, what is different... I think you want your money back... No, not for me. You may be missed. Thank you very much. The pie was to die for! And please don't tell your mom about this. Clear... Your mother? He is my mother's neighbor. Well, then... See you soon. Thank you very much indeed. You are welcome. Goodbye! What a hideous ass! And how much did he charge? 28 Pesos. 20, because 8 is the taxi! He could have at least changed the light bulb. Evil. Your mother's neighbor?! But for 20,000 we're going to get kicked out for not paying rent! Listen What did the lady tell you exactly? I can not talk to her. The phone is just a problem. That's why I never reply, so... - I can not talk to her. - Yes, but what then? The secretary answers it. Dani, it's me, Alberto. I really enjoyed last night. Call me, okay. Alberto? What Albert? How do you give the number to everyone? Oh balls! Monas, I know you're there! myself the I'll throw it out. Your check bounced and I have no other income. I had to support my family on my own. Nobody helped me, because nowadays nobody helps. - Yes, I know you don't care... - It's crazy... And they still hear a strange and devilish music. Your meditation tapes. You don't like your neighbors, you only harm. Next month the contract ends. You better pay or go out on the streets. I don't feel sorry, because in life I struggled. - At least you didn't insult us. - Wait, wait. - Faggots! - It saw?! I already know! We can rent the mess room to pay the rent! A stranger at home? It's not final, just a few months. - I'd rather that than change. - Clear. It scares me to have a stranger here. We can advertise in the newspaper and do interviews like: "Single White Women Seek" "Single White Women Seek"? Why would I be against it? "Beautiful room for rent" Isn't it "money"? "Excellent plan". No way. "Cheap". Not so much! - What is she laughing at? - "That they don't like football..." "or folk music lovers". Well, honey, not football. Definitely not! - We have other candidates, okay? - Great. Anyway, I will leave my card. It's a recycled card. I know you are ecologists, it is not? Why are you laughing? It's pathetic. I love ballet, jazz, flamenco, contemporary... I always wanted to be a dancer... the problem is in my house, with a military father, you imagine. All my friends are dancers, idealists. I'll find them soon. Want to see a step? We'll be on Channel 5, as a dancer. We're putting together a musical... wonderful. I can sing too. Want me to sing a little song? OK. Don't let him... I work in the public market and I wake up every day at 6 am. no problems and I don't mind bringing people home, because in a singles house, you know that "today you, tomorrow me". And as for homework, no problem. Since we men don't complicate cleaning, order and the motherfucker. That's a thing for women or with no bones. Boneless? Yeah, like... fagots. Yes, like wretched fagots. I make clothes to order, I mean, I'm a seamstress. And I need a space for my Singer, and... this salon fits perfectly, it's big. - Right, Jose? - Totally. It's an excellent house. All the details of this outfit were made by me, with the machine I bought for the TV. His clothes too. So you know, if you want something... I also make curtains with big hems. It's over. What did you say? We are renting for one person, not two. Okay, it's just me. But if my boyfriend visits me, he can, right? What's a boyfriend for? And if my relatives visit me, they don't stay in a hotel. What do you think, hey? I liked it, but you don't say anything. But with a dog... - Forget it. - Puppy? She is not a dog. She is a person. Don't talk to my girl like that, she's a model. I liked it here. For me I would stay. for a dog would have no problem. I think I know you! I? Yes. Are you not Dani? Yes, his name is Dani... There! I'm George! We met another day at the Refuge. You promised to call me. I've been waiting all afternoon. You are all the same. If we stand still as we are, We will arrive on New Year's Eve without a tenant. "Is his name Daniel?" Why don't you stick your tongue up your ass? You're cultured, Dani, your fault! You are promiscuous and do not respect the feelings of others. And I speak to you with advice, not to upset you. Yes, take a rest. Keep quiet because I don't want advice from you. Love is something you don't know. - Do you know what your problem is? - No, I don't want to hear it! I don't want to hear! You're just jealous because you never had anyone. Dani! What did he say? What did you tell me? Who plays the victim because otherwise nobody looks at you. Yes. And you? sorry but the door was open. - Don't worry. - Don't worry. I came about the room. But I think they must have already rented it. - No! - Nothing! It's my lucky day! Ours too! Want a toke? OK. Rent is 35,000 pesos per month. - But we can leave it for 30,000. - Yes, of course, 30,000. That's what I calculated. We charge 1 month in advance... as bail. Is that... we have to pay... She is like this... Good, Now I'm in a hurry. Can it wait for tomorrow? - Yes, it's yours. - Yes. Well, then... Thank you. Want to see the room? It should be like the rest. It certainly is perfect. - I'll come tomorrow. - Handsome, huh? I always say that good taste is not acquired, you are born with it. Well, then... Thank you very much. - What is your name? - Lucas. - How beautiful! - Perfect. I'm Dani. - Tony. - I'm Carlos, kind of clumsy. It's delicious. I saw something else. I saw something else. It is sensitive, distinct. - Distinct. - Distinct. He has something New Age, connected with the energy of the universe. It means you would catch him. He's big! As a father... What an ass! Stop! He will only stay here for 2 months, and we are friends. No advancing on it, right? Totally. Our friendship comes first. Three months later Did you make a date with him at karaoke? Scored? No... What happened then? He only took one turn. What did he want? I can not say. It's our business. I kill you! I kill you! Fag! Orange juice... So that you may be a man and not lack... a muffin, a donut, nothing else! The psychoanalysis is over, and anxiolytics. What a joy of summer... eat a cookie when you are... in love! - Faggot! - Go eat shit! Scum! Faggot! Lucas, can I come in? Breakfast! It's me, Charles! Lucas! It's Carlos! - What are you doing? - Do not talk to me! What a dead fly! He even put a flower! Give me that! Asshole! Luke is not here! Goes into! Where would he go so soon? What trauma! I see! Now you have something to say to your psychologist. What it was? This coffee I prepared for myself. It would just wake Lucas up. That was it! That was it! I have reservations for a weekend in Cuenca. Are we going or not? Because in this situation... no problem for me. Much less for me. Let's go to Cuenca. Hello? Lucas? Where are you going? Cuenca? Tomorrow! Tonight...of course. I'm off karaoke. They? Do not like a lot to go out... Lucas? All good! Yes yes... - Of course I can leave. - I'm going out too, Lucas. Yes yes... I will be there... Where do we score? We didn't, I scored! I'm going. I don't want to be late for the walk. I'm going to the laundry. Dani! - Please, where did you book? - Leave me alone! You yourself say I don't have a chance... Not one in a million! Tell me where to meet, which I say because Lucas went to see Toni at Karaoke. - You first. - Not you. - Until later! - Hang on! He is well! He went to see Toni because he wanted discounted drinks. Drink at a discount? Yes, for that. - Where will they go? - Goodbye! Dani, everything I said is a lie! - Is not true! - Shit! It's a lie! Carlos! Carlos, where are you? - Carlos! - What? Are you thinking about Lucas? Yes, but don't worry, I'm fine. I can stay if you go to the therapist. No, I'm not going. Look Charles... I'm not the best to talk about it because I fall in love and I go blind. But I see you need help... - Yes, Anna! - Forget about him and go to therapy! Well, I tell you that I feel good. Plus we have a date night. For what? Where they will go...? Look, Carlos. There comes a time when the head gives a "click"... - Yes, Anna - and you get real. No woman. He called to make an appointment with me, but Dani picked up the phone first. Carlos, look at something... Where could they have met? I will know?! Just one thing: the next time this guy comes here I won't ask you to stay. Yes, Anna. I'm warning you... Perhaps they were at Praça da Devoção! Charles, I don't want to know. Yes, Anna. Now, take a deep breath, and we feel how the air runs through our whole body. we focus in these statements: Love dissolves anger, Love frees us from guilt and casts down fear. Now we visualize the people who need to be forgiven. Imagine these people who have ever hurt you no longer have any power over you. Imagine everyone doing their best every moment. I don't need an apology, fagot. Repeat with me: I forgive you for not being the way I wanted you to be. I forgive you... for not being how I wanted. Now he will be free, you will see. I forgive you and set you free. I forgive you... and you... I forgive you, I approve of you. I accept you, I approve of you I love you, Crap! - 9:10 - Lucas! Are you not there? Good... I'll be gone all day. - I'll see you later. - Wait, wait, wait... But where? I'm leaving. - We will. - The three of us. I go and do not follow me. What time does he arrive? Close to 1 o'clock. It's almost 4! Take a turn, go! - When are you going to Cuenca? - Tomorrow morning. If Miguel asks, I'll be with you, okay? Don't get me into this... Emilio! Lucas would never do that to me, but he did to you. Did it with me? He wanted to go out with me, but he scored with you. And where did you score, it is a mistake. If he scored with me, what the fuck are you doing here? Jeez! The night is not yours, and the nightclub much less, so... Your problem is that you burn yourself. You take it out on others, because you need to compensate for your frustration to feel better. And that, dear, it doesn't get you anywhere. I will break your face. What do you think? Toni, have you seen Estrella? No, it must be dancing. Probably. Do you think I'm "closed"? A little you are. But I accept people as they are. We have to talk sometime, Toni. We have to talk... When you want. We have to talk. Poor guy, I love him more than my friend Estrella. Are you sure he comes here? Look! Look! Isn't that the one? No, it's not. Will not be long. Don't follow me. Don't tell me, damn it! Definitely, Lucas would never let me down. I don't want to argue with you, but Lucas would do that to you too and maybe worse. And you too. So much so that it's already in the shit. You're the one in the shit, fagot! - Where are you? - Around the club. - And you? - I am here. And you? Only here. Have you seen Lucas? No, and you? He was here but he left with someone. - With whom? - With whom? I don't know. He said he was accompanied today. And I thought it was one of you. And what did you ask him to say he was accompanied? I? Anything. What is it? Does Lucas belong to you? No, but almost... So nobody belongs to anybody! Drink something! No, I'm going home! I will go with you. I'm going too. You are hurting yourselves. No one is worth that much to lose their head. It is a very dangerous thing to know who you are. I could have been a volleyball star. And I'm here, serving drinks to men. you think i like it but only by the natural selection of species. Wanted to be picked all over the coast, and by the most basic animal instinct will end up as "Rosário da Aurora" You lose your mind and then it becomes dangerous. Very, very dangerous. - Why did you do that? - What? You disappeared from the club. You two are gone too. - And you're treating your nerves. - What are you implying? - I love him. - Shut up, Toni. He wanted to be with me. Excuse me, but Lucas wanted to stay with me. We should have left him where he was, or at least having taken the knife set out of the kitchen. The knives. Are you seeing alone? - What? - You bought them this week. But I also bought the therapeutic pillow, and half of Teleshop, and that doesn't make me the killer. If you weren't so addicted to Teleshop it would not be necessary to rent the room and then we wouldn't have left the house and Lucas wouldn't be there dead... He arrives! And does it matter now? What do we do? Still! There's someone at the door. Juliana! Juliana! Hello, my triplets! Are you not going to Cuenca? We didn't expect you here today. Fool! I spoke to the Carlos. I forgot to let them know. We didn't combine anything. But they can change their minds! Can't come another day? - It's just that today is difficult, isn't it? - Yes... Look, fagot... Do you know how long it took me from Alpedrete to get here? - What are those red spots? - They're blood, baby. I noticed, but I didn't want to talk. What happened? Anything! Like nothing? What did they do to this poor boy? It wasn't me they did... - Neither you nor anyone else. - Then... What the fuck is going on here? Lucas is dead! What did you say?! Where is he? In the bedroom. Please do not enter! See... I buried my father I buried my husband and buried my brother-in-law, who died in an accident with a broken head. Get out of the way. Why did you tell her? Look, Dani, First, I told you why I have a mouth, and second, I told you why Juliana is like a mother to me. But I wouldn't tell mine. Calm down, Juliana is a very strong woman, with cold blood. Juliana! in my village there are many crimes. there anyone has a weapon and an enemy. But what I saw, what I saw here today, there is no sense. Let's call the police! - Wait! - What? Wait for Lucas to rot and stink? Juliana, by God! First we have to know if they will accuse us of living in the same house. Clear. If you call, ask for the inspector. Pretend she's a screenwriter. What is a screenwriter? Who writes stories. Try impersonating a TV writer, who is writing a crime series and ask for the information. It saw? It's a good idea. And why the fuck should I call? You have the key to this house, right? Of course, you gave it to me. So you are among the suspects, a little involved. - I am going. - Wait, Julia. Keep calm. But please, call you who has more way. Of course not! I already have too many problems! What the fuck do I say? Ask the inspector. Say you're a screenwriter, working on an episode you need to know a few things... Like what happens to the partners from the house of someone who dies? Who dies, no. Who killed! Of course, he was murdered. A screenwriter? That! Hi, pass me to the person in charge, please!? With the Chief Inspector! Yes, with the inspector chief in charge. Thanks. It's an inspector! They will call you. Much better to be a woman. Yes. Good morning lady! Let me introduce myself. I'm a TV star... who writes screenplays... My name? - She asked my name! - Make some up! So... Barbara Tenalle González. Barbara Tenalle Gonzalez! What the hell! Yes... As I said, I'm writing... a TV series about murder... with the use of a knife, of those sharp ones they sell on TV, they cut very well. Don't hand us over! Yes. That. I want to know what happens to people who live with a dead body. Yes, with a person who killed. No, they didn't... he was already dead. Listen, the question is: What would happen to them and their day laborer who have the key to the house, who is already a retired lady, that she doesn't know anything about anything! What will the series be called? You know, we haven't thought about what it's going to be called yet... - "Crimes of Spain" - I think that.. will be called "Crimes of Spain". Yes Yes Yes... Rua Pontejo, nº 16, port A. Yes Yes Yes... As you wish. She didn't believe anything... - She's coming here! - I have therapy and I need to go. You will wait for the police to arrive. And how am I? Clean... or not clean? Please, Mari Carmen, please! What? I stumbled! - Did you bring the gun? - Yes, but please... ..let's not use it. They didn't do anything! - What about the badge? - I left it in my white bag. You change purses every single day! - Let me see, Juliana! - By God, Charles! Are two! - Look at you. - What? - Didn't like it? - Of course. She looks nothing like a Super Cop Woman. But if I go home and change, I'll be late for Rosi's wedding. Let me see their faces? Let me see if I know them. They are at home and do not open. Not my style, but if they don't open, I shoot down the door! Yes! What do you want? Police. I received a very absurd call from this residence, that make us suspect that a murder took place here. A murder! How silly! Yes. How silly! - Do you have a search warrant? - Well remembered! Get out of the way! - Mari Carmen, follow me. - Sorry. - Where is the body? - You're wrong. don't try to deceive me and tell me where the body is or we'll search the place. Knowing you would come, if there was a corpse... - don't you think we would have gotten rid of him? - That is true! In broad daylight, not being professionals, I highly doubt it. Listen! She's criminology in America. In the USA! Where is it? It's in the bedroom. What's his room? Shut up and learn I ask the questions. What "was" his room? The first door with color. He painted it. - I am innocent! - And me! And I do the cleaning and they don't pay the social security! It was not me! We don't pay because you came in here and didn't want to wait. now he is very destroyed, but he was Super cute. It still is for me. Now it has a morbid appearance, but when he was alive, he was a sweet person. It's Lucas! I'm sensing they knew him and that this can make things worse. Lucas was her boyfriend. He disappeared 3 months ago without a word. Since then she has not stopped vomiting... Shut up, Mari Carmen! She does facial exercises to help her relax. Learned that in America too. Of course, New Age therapy. I'm a big fan of rebirth, of magnetotherapy, self-healing... - Where are you going? - Call the IML... to come get poor Lucas's body. Sit down! Not a fly moves in here until I find out who killed my boyfriend. Boyfriend? How daring! Look, honey... We are innocent until that proves the opposite. Don't be hysterical. He called me hysterical? He called me hysterical? So this is what you want, smartass!? Take note that he insulted an officer of the law. Clara, he just said that because he's nervous. you will write, or do I write? I left my notebook in my white bag. I need to go to the bathroom. In the back. - Keep your eyes on them. - All right, have a nice puke. Her dress is very beautiful. Thank you very much! A friend of the police is getting married tonight. And I won't have time to get ready. Clear... I imagined it myself. - Very beautiful, isn't it? - Yes. Hey... Do you have a camera lying around? Yes. Mine. I thought about taking you to Cuenca. Less bad. I forgot mine and Clara goes to look for her... in her white bag? And those bags? We plan to stay a weekend in Cuenca. I am a tour guide for an agency and since we have a discount, We take advantage of the price that comes out much cheaper. But all this ruined our plans. Not that it's not important. How long had Lucas lived here? 3 months, since August. Interpol calling me and him in Madrid the whole time. What are you doing, Mari Carmen? You asked me to photograph everything. Not me, cutie. Excuse me. could you photograph me so I can send it to my village? They always ask for a photo. - Is my hair okay? - Yes. How did Lucas end up here? We advertised and he showed up. The most important things in life it happens like that, effortlessly. Still. I don't want to argue again. Give me the fucking camera, that's good. What is your relationship with Lucas? I don't know if I'm going to tell. I think it should unless you don't want another complaint for hiding data. Right, in this case, I'm sorry about all of this. Lucas and I had sex all the time. It was basically our relationship. And there are other things, you know. My Lucas with a guy? Like you? I was going to tell you today, but with this case... What... what do you have? Julia, help me! He's very sensitive. I got it. I can take care of it. - You studied psychology in America. - In the United States. - Listen...! - Clear! Get up now or I'll call your mom and tell you that you are dying. Not my mother, by God! I feel so much better much better, really. What? You really have to die! Toni, I'm already better! The mother's trick does not fail. These cases are 15% of true hysteria, the rest is pure deception. I always suspected, but I didn't know what to say. You really are a whore! And you're an actress project, darling. Continue with your version, please. Mari Carmen, release the pause. When Lucas got here became my great friend, and these two became envious. Especially Carlos who is... you can see how it is. Where did you say you are from? Well, by birth, really born, I was born in Australia. Australia! I love it, my God! And what else. Nonetheless, I lived in many places. You know, I traveled a lot. Serious? A bohemian with that body! Who would say? And what does that have to do with it? I fully agree. Are you with... - a little stain. - What? What do you work with? Sorry, I ask too much, right? No. I do not work. I travel, I live... I want new experiences. That's what I do. Work does not dignify anything, on the contrary. I have to go or I'll miss my first shift. Are you gay or not? Hi Lucas. Plants are very decorative. They pass energy, health and emotional stability... Hi Lucas. Plants are very decorative. They pass energy, health and emotional stability... Fuck the agency! What is that? Plants are decorative. They pass energy, health, and emotional stability... But I dropped them. Was it for me? No, no, it was mine... It was mine. If you want I can plant it again. No, no, not at all. It's better to turn it. Goodbye! Whoa, Carlos, don't be like that. You already got half of Madrid, and had to get him too, huh? You are a dog. True Carlos. Maybe this time it's serious. I have nobody, and you still steal it from me. I told you I liked him, and you, always selfish... Carlos, please, you didn't stand a chance. Why? Why am I fat? I did not say that. No? So why did you say? Come on, speak the truth! Because you are different from most. Come on, speak the truth now! Yes, it's because you're fat. Not fat, very fat! Without any chance. Even more so in the gay world where the physique is so important. Carlos, I warned you. Sorry, but you asked for the truth. Yes. In these years I had a lot of sex, and with faces I wouldn't recognize. But that doesn't make me insensitive and much less a murderer. With Lucas it started with sex, but we ended up falling in love. It was already suffocating. it was our secret out of respect for them. We even plan to travel together to his country, Australia. Was Lucas Australian? Yes, from Sydney. This made Carlos worse and worse. Every hour in therapy, took pills. Since he didn't talk to me, one day I asked Lucas to speak with him. - This is mine? - This is not mine. Yes, it's mine. Imagine my problem, having to put up with all this, unable to call him. Still, I'm glad it's nothing serious. Cornerstone, if you need anything, call me. Thank you, Ana, but you know I won't need it. No, I know you. Till next week, God willing, it will be another. Goodbye. And it will be, lass. How are you, Anna? - Carlos is here, yes? - Yeah, over there. Hello Carlos. - We can talk? - Quick, I'm working. Dani and I are very good. Not if it will last, because it happened too fast, and we want you to understand and be happy for us. You were very cruel to me. But why? I couldn't say why, but you deceived me and hurt me too much. Carlos! See, you made him cry. You better go. - You don't understand that I want... - Dude, get out! Go! Okay, see you later, sorry... What you need to do is go out, dress up and go out! The streets are crowded with men. No, not that. I know what I need to do. What face is this Carlos?! You scare me! Lucas... Lucas... - What are you doing, fagot? - Anything! Get out! - Carlos! - Get out! - Carlos! - Lucas... - Carlos, open up! - Lucas... Carlos! Open the door, Carlos! Open up, Carlos! Carlos! Daniel. What Daniel? Daniel, I live with Carlos... I was so desperate I called your analyst and I told everything tim tim by tim tim. He didn't like that I called, by the time, ms it said that in the next session, I would deal with him. It calmed me down. After a few days, I saw that Carlos was better and forgot about it. Now I blame myself that everything turned out like this. Liar son of a bitch! - He's crazy! Is he seeing? - Liar! He arrives! It doesn't cost me anything end up with a trio of fagots... Honey, I haven't said a word yet. Clara, it's not worth risking his career... Yes, there is a lot of unemployment and a lot of people working... without social security. I don't want one more scene, because I'm about to lose control. Reactionary! What did you say? - Can I make you some coffee? - Yes yes... - Do you have tea? - Chinese? - Yes, good Chinese tea. - Chinese... with lemon, please. Mari Carmen, search the room and see what you find. Second door. Everything that fagot said is a lie! We'll see. Sit down... and relax... Relax. Look, Madam Inspector, I don't know much about laws but I have the impression that your procedure not exactly cool. You arrive, without any warrant, interrogating us, photographing... We didn't even call a lawyer! Are you threatening me? We do not enter by force, we're here having a friendly chat. If you want, I'll call the patrol and we can take care of it legally at the police station. They'll take your fingerprints, put them in the file, you will sleep over there and the interrogation will be done by Inspector Martínez, from homicide. - He hates gays. - No, it's much better here.... not at the police station. Clear. Better tell at home, drinking coffee, chinese tea, with lemon. It's hard to get over everything that we have suffered for years. We are imperfect... - Some deserve medals. - We all have flaws. You too, Danny. We have to learn to live inside our own skin. My father taught me a lot with his education. It's true, I go to an analyst, and I have been taking anxiolytics for 1 year. But since Lucas walked through this door my life has changed for the better. But for Dani, all of this was disgusting. All this apparent confidence and control over things it went down the drain. The difference between me and others is that I don't like monotony at all. I'm ready for change go out and travel. I know all of Spain. Except Andalusia. I know all of Castile. Do you like to travel? I'm not that traveled, actually... Are you not from Australia? From Australia? I never said that. I'm from here. Sorry, you might find that - I'm a snoop with so many questions. - It's not that, it's that I'm very busy at the moment, you know. Well, sorry, I'm on my way... It was nothing. Are you gay or not? What you mean? - I'm going to explain to you. - Look, no... make no mistake, make no mistake because... Hello how are you? Carlos! And this orchid? I'm an environmental defender. and I dedicate myself entirely to nature It's a gift I bring you to decorate your room. It's a cymbidium! You are understood... in plants! Orchids especially! Well, I started growing them myself. What the hell, Dani! He's tough. I will replant. Thank you very much. Lucas, I don't know how to say... but long ago... that I expected someone like you to arrive in this house. Yes. You don't have to say anything. Fucking fat! Fucking fat! - Fat ass! - Dani... Fucking fat! Why is it like this? You had to show up and speak of the culture of your little plants!? Dani, I'll tell you something: you stay with everyone because he lives cultivating the body. But I'm sorry to say that there are people here... which has other values. I didn't know that obesity was a high value. Fuck Dani. You are so shallow. Shallow, me? Go to hell! Good. Lucas was not a rich idler. He was a professor of botany, and nothing Australian. He was from Chinchón. It's just that Dani loves Australia and so he fantasizes about land and wealth once you get there. An inner obsession. Don't argue with an unbalanced person. That land is rich yes! - I read! - "I read" Where, modern? Did you read it in "Revista Contigo"? I don't remember, but it's true! You are from Chinchón. Lucas was from Sydney! Even in the origins we coincided. We were nail and flesh. And Dani was embarrassed, because I wanted him at all costs. Dani always had a lot of inferiority complex, for your lack of studies, you know? And then he teases me a lot, because I... I have too much study. Clara, it's true about voodoo. Look what I found under his bed. Maria del Carmen. Hindus and Buddhists - How embarrassing! - What it was? Buddhism and voodoo are different things, honey. The sounds are the same, it's normal for her to be wrong. Still keep looking because he has one under his bed! I have voodoo books and many subjects under my bed. I read all kinds of literature and I have nowhere to put it. Clara, maybe this is not the best time, much less important, is that someone took one of the knives of poor Lucas... Who made this? I. Know that they will fall on you for having changed an evidence. Look... Don't make a fool of yourself, because I did it for you! For me? Good. How would I cut the lemon for your tea? If you keep vomiting, it will pierce your stomach. As Linda Blair in "The Exorcist" Outside! Outside! Outside! Outside! Look... can I light one? I actually don't know what to say. For drugs, there are some phrases that I didn't memorize... you can smoke, but not sell... or consume, but not in front of others. In fact, better wait Clara, I don't know if it's illegal or not. Already lit. It's better? Who lit a joint? It's to relax and get me hooked because it's my turn. Drug addict. I said what the law says but he ignored me. I don't want any more stories. Who killed Lucas? Don't be so direct with them. Clear! Clear! What, Maria del Carmen Benito, what? Can I start recording? Do I need to tell you everything? I was also in love with Lucas. But that doesn't matter now, why this story it was such a deep case that nothing hits me. They try to blame each other for the death, but my version doesn't blame anyone because I can't judge one or the other. To each his own conscience. Death is death any way it comes. What did he say? He's doing the "mystical" line. Initially I only think of one thing: Probably one of the three of us will spend the night in jail. And we are such good friends. We had a lot of fun before Lucas arrived. friendship and fun are important! So what the fuck happened last night? Be patient, Inspector. No fact is isolated. all events travel through time acquiring on this path its true meaning. Lucas' murder didn't start last night! I'm a bartender at a karaoke bar of the third age Karaoke for seniors? - Yes... - It was my idea. My agency works with pensioners. Amateurs will sing. It all started 1 month ago, when Estrella argued with her husband. Like always! Who is Estrella? A bitch they say she sings! Juliana we don't pay you to offend our friend. Estrella is a complete artist who works in karaoke. The thing is that Estrella argued with Miguel... for bullshit. It's time to start acting like a man! Fuck! Where is the dress? It wasn't the first argument. That fight touched my soul. that made me think in my own solitude. Estrella's words, that at first had nothing new, touched me deeply. ...that bitch mother of yours! I can't take it anymore, Toni! She doesn't understand me! I am aware of everything. She doesn't think so, but... I know many things. Dry the tears, she can't see you like this. Why not? Do you think she'll soften? On the contrary! In love we tend to play cat and mouse. If you love me, I don't want you if i love you, you don't want me. And you love her so much... and she ignores me. More or less. Let's go... Let's go to work. I think that... I shouldn't go out. See how you act thinking about her reaction? Be yourself, Miguel. Be yourself. I know that Estrella is now crying her eyes out. when she drinks, she becomes unbearable. And I feel incapable because she doesn't listen to me. Last night she hit me. She scares me. Don't let her hit you, Miguel. You understand me. It's easier for me than for Estrella. For you, love is easier than for most. It's not fair for you to be alone. You deserve someone who loves you very much, someone who makes you feel at home. The words of Miguel settled into the universe that very night. Estrella started with a romantic theme. I'm here. "Lonely City". I remember when he walked in. Who are you referring to? Lucas, of course. He went to find me. All streets are full of people. By air floats a song. But alone I am, I'll go alone without having your love. I came to get you. What time do you leave? Within 2 hours yet. I'm not bothered. I hope. Every night... I need to talk to you... You do not need to say anything. I already know what it is. He knows? I feel... I hope it's what I'm thinking. One beer? Wow, Toni! You are so intuitive! It's not intuition... it's something else. We fell in love. Wasn't going to mention how these two reacted to that, because it would practically be a murder charge. How truly loved this man! Did he declare himself to you? No, I did. There were a number of signs, you know? Why don't you stop being exoteric and not tell who bought the knives? Who bought? I i i... but so what? Like "so what"? It's the murder weapon. Received them this week. Why don't you tell me you hit me when did lucas come to see me? And why with all this spirituality don't you tell that you listen to tapes to get the envy and shit out of you? They are meditation tapes! You're bad, fagot! I look like it, but you are! Please don't argue anymore, the tape only supports 60 minutes. What was Lucas talking to you about that night? He just wanted to pay cost price, that's all. It was just an excuse to see me! this is starting to annoy me! Lucas was a drug addict, and of the worst kind! What are you saying? She doesn't understand that. It starts with cigars, and end up injecting marijuana with syringes! Juliana, you are foolish. I've told you a thousand times. Lucas took my daughter, innocent as it is, to this drug underworld and all that shit! Lucas and his daughter? Lucas and my daughter! What is her name? Katherine, 17 years old. Here from Madrid. How did they meet? One day I went to the spine doctor, you know? She came here to do the cleaning. Damn time! My daughter is very pretty, you know? She looks like a model. The problem is that she is naive and can be easily deceived. You know nothing about men, and Lucas... taught her. When you first saw her, he tried to seduce her. It wasn't easy for him, like I said, Katherine She's pretty naive about these things. But he did. He broke up with her. I was so obsessed, I started watching them all the time. No rest, desperate, because it doesn't exist... nothing more painful to a mother, than to see a daughter thrown in the street, completely helpless, weak and all fucked up! Shitty fagots! You only know how to give ass. I have no children, but I feel like I have. And why don't they? I don't know, but it's like he has. Where is your daughter now? I sent her to the village, to stay away from Lucas. Now it's fine... leading a healthy life... simple. How long has this been? 20 days. So she has an alibi. But the same cannot be said of you. From what he said, and having the keys to the house, you are as suspicious as they are. It's just because you want to! Remember I'm an inspector as well as a criminologist. Juliana, in these cases, no one is better than her. Don't be a sucker! The four have some reason to have killed Lucas. But everyone lies. Lucas wasn't a drug addict or a faggot, Not Australian or anything. Lucas was... my Lucky. Your Lucky, Lycky, Lucky!? If it was your Lucky, why did he leave you? Because they argued a lot. Clara tired him out with her manners and perfectionism. How do you cross shitty Mari Carmen? Sorry Claire, but... as you said, I didn't think it was a secret. We were very happy like two halves of the same piece. We were perfect. You can be a good cop, But that is not true. It's a lie, it wasn't perfect at all. He told me many things. For you? His clothes were a joke to him. What a surprise! Is not true! You were a disaster! And he leaned on me a lot! It was a disaster because you meddled and wanted to take it away from me. Or do you think I didn't notice that... did you want to have sex with him? Naughty! You want to sum it up in one fuck!? What are you saying? It's leaving me dead! It's me. I'm here at the club you said. I'm waiting for you. Are you there? Lucas, are you there? Well, I'll wait for you for another hour, okay? Goodbye! Rewind! It's me. I'm here at the club you said. I'm waiting for you. Are you there? Lucas, are you there? Well, I'll wait for you for another hour, okay? Goodbye! It's your voice! You knew where he was! What did you do? Don't go so fast because you knew too. - What you mean? - You have details of missing persons. 3 days ago you had his address and phone number. I got them from your notebook! What did you say? - You know you're accusing me? - How can you be so cynical? What will they say at the police station when they see you tricked them by saying who would take this new case, Do you already have the address and phone number? And that you didn't want to remove the body? You paid with your tongue. Are you accusing me of murder? It would come as no surprise to me. Paco, a neighbor of mine in the village, one day at your house, he ate, sat, got up and filled his wife with bullets. And he was a civil guard! Someone is opening the door! Behind the sofa! Lucas... Where are you? It's Star! Already in bed, pervert?! I'll suck you in the bath... I'll suck you in the kitchen... I'll suck you on the terrace... I'll suck you in the broom closet... I'll suck and suck and suck... Was the bastard screwing that slut? She always said Lucas was scum. With Estrella! My blind and difficult karma... What a disgrace! As far as I'm concerned, Lucas might as well be dead now. What a beautiful corset she was wearing! 10 and a half! The wedding is over. This afternoon. Shall I prepare something for us to eat? It's just unconscious. Lucas, not one more. Prepare whatever you want but no onion. Without onion. Empty! What a promiscuous fridge! I can't eat anything. How we were going to travel we didn't do any shopping. And Lucas didn't help with shopping, a shame. Neither shopping nor with housework. Since you said, I cleaned the room and got angry. - Yes - Then... Lucas was no example of kindness. And as a lover he was rather boring. But you took... or not? Lucas yes... Certain things happen. To appear in bed, You can't be on drugs 24 hours a day. But I fucked with Estrella. He even gave her the keys. Now we learn not to like the first asshole who makes fun of us. Now I am happy, because he is dead, he could become a myth like James Dean, or Che Guevara, what would be worse. If he wasn't dead, I swear that now I would kill. A bastard like that isn't going to ruin my career. Much less mine! Juliana, you don't have a career! - But I have a family book. - What are we going to do now? I need a big blanket, a bottle of alcohol and 2 tranquilizers. - My tranquilizers? - What do we do? Disappear with the body? If you prefer, we go to the police station, where we will all be suspects. - Or accomplices. - Or murderers. Lucas is not worth all that. What if the police show up? And I'm the police! - That makes me very calm. - Me too. And the others say what? I place myself in your hands, Clara. For me, police stations hide the truth. Help me, Mari Carmen. I'll suck you in... She won't wake up this morning. And the boys? What? Prepare Lucas. We can't do it all alone! Juliana, take the boys' luggage downstairs. And you, Mari Carmen, bring the car to the front of the entrance. Juliana, you're crushing my foot! What the fuck! Look at that delicate child! - Where will we go? - To the Police Academy. What? It's the perfect place. I know him well... Why do you look at me like that? You are so Beautiful. Serious? break the law it does you so much good. You're always so serious. You don't go home on Sunday like we planned. Estrella will wake up alone and won't remember anything what she saw or what she believed she saw. And what am I going to say in karaoke? Absolutely nothing! She won't say anything either, you will see. And about the suitcase with Lucas' things, I'll take it with me. Starting tomorrow, we never saw each other. Can't we keep anything from Lucas? Not even with the memories. Girls! - Clear! Mari Carmen! - It's calling you. Hey girls! Clara, it's Rosi! Javi, roll down the window! Congratulations Rosie! Cheers! The police lent them a car! Sometimes the police are considerate. Fuck, why didn't they go to the wedding? Is she from the drug division? What an ugly thing! Is that we are in service. And those back there? Are they delinquent? - No.. - Yes! So let's escort them, huh Paco? Woman, it's your wedding, forget it. Cute, we didn't leave Euro Disney this morning! -Let's escort and not another peep! Turn on the lights! No! Leave us alone! Hurry, Mari Carmen! She is upset because of her. Fuck, Paco, why didn't you talk to her? Dear... when you get mad, looks drop dead gorgeous! - Juliana! - What? These houses bring to mind a lot of men. I've already caught a lot... here. A question: you just fucked... just when i was... very passionate, right? I always did everything with love. DO NOT ENTER Put it there. - He'll get burned! - But he's dead! Quickly! One moment! Anyone want to plead guilty? My camera! Clear... What? Did he really laugh at my clothes? Yes and me too. And now, what do we do? Now let's go out and get something to eat. So late? To where? Close to my house there is one open 24 hours. - Pili, Pili, listen. - Shit, don't call me Pili. - But Pili... - Leave me alone! Someone wants? I live on this corner. I'll take a taxi, because from here to Alpedrete... Where are we all going to sleep? If you want to come with me, I have spare bunks. Do not let. I can stay at my mother's house. I'll drink something and see what comes up. Come with me? No no... I prefer to walk a little. Until Monday. The sun is tired of much walking, he goes that goes he goes that goes The shadows of the night pass slowly over me hey, how cold now... hey, how cold now... It would only suffice receive a caress to give you my heart! What is life if there is no affection? It's like a pain that never goes away. It's like the wind the icy wind that makes the city sad and lonely. What is life, what... if you're not. I feel like a bee that has run out of flowers that doesn't fly anymore, no longer flies. Who wanders through the fire of his immense love which is off. Oh, how cold now... Oh, how cold now... You erased the smile that bloomed on my lips And you know well that you won't come back. What is life? if there is no affection It is like a tree that without leaves has fallen It's like the wind, the icy wind, that makes the city sad and lonely. And what is life, what, if you're not. The cold wind, makes me sad...
