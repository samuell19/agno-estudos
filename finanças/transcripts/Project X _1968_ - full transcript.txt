Miss Dennis, please. Dr. Crowther, Intelligence wants you to begin at once. Colonel, you are asking the impossible. I'm not asking, doctor. I'm relaying an order. - Process has never been reversed. - Well, it's got to be done. And immediately. Hagen Arnold has been frozen for four days now. Yes, what have you been waiting for? I have been waiting for a decision. You don't realize high-level meetings on this have been held all over the Western world. Well, the orders have finally come through. Find out the meaning of Hagen Arnold's last message. Once the psycho-barrier has been activated, you cannot restore a memory. Have you ever tried? Yes, we have. Then try again. Let's close the capsule. Dr. Craig, Miss Dennis, will you excuse us, please? Will you please tell me what the head of Security is doing here? How much has Crowther told you? Only that Hagen Arnold was on a special mission in Sino-Asia. - Did he fail? - Oh, no. On the contrary, he was quite successful. He was sent to confirm a rumor that the Sinoese were mass-producing male babies. Only boys? Scientific breakthrough. Hagen Arnold sent back the information and then, apparently, he stumbled onto something bigger. What could be bigger than that? Stover. Dr. Crowther, I would like to see a much more positive attitude. Colonel Holt, whatever Hagen Arnold knew has been erased from his mind. - Are you sure? - Absolutely sure? No, I'm not. It could conceivably be lurking in the depths of his subconscious. But how on earth are we gonna dredge it up? - You're the scientist. - We have ten days. And the earth was created in six. Thank you, gentlemen. - This is serious. This is damn serious. - You Security boys, you come in here and you ask us to develop a serum that will obliterate the memory. Then you come back and you demand the impossible. All right, all right, Dr. Crowther. You're right, of course. But do we have a choice? No, I suppose not. We'll try. Good. I don't care what method you use, but the less people involved, the better. Well, there won't be any outsiders but I've gotta have my staff. All right. Colonel Cowen will remain here as liaison if there's anything you need. We must be getting back to the Capitol. Thank you, Dr. Crowther. I'll show you out. Excuse me, colonel. That's quite all right. Are you all right, colonel? Why, yes, I... I... Well, I'm not very comfortable here, doctor. I'm sorry, I... I know it's immature, but I have a feeling about death. I understand. But you see, we consider this just a sort of waiting period. All the men and women here served the country with great distinction in their various fields, and they all died of ailments for which we have as yet no cures. But some day we will. And then we'll be able to thaw them out and extend their lives. But Hagen Arnold? Well, Hagen Arnold is a kind of exception. He's really a temporary lodger. - How? I mean, well... - How do we do it? Well, when it's been decided that the person dying is to be preserved, we start freezing as close as possible to the actual moment of clinical death, so that the tissue remains in a nearly perfect state until the thaw. And after-effects? Are there any? Almost none if the process begins soon enough after death. This is our vital statistics room. All of our subjects in trial biology have had their lives minutely examined and, of course, recorded. I am Charles Bingham. This is a sample of my voice. I was born in Virginia and lived there most of my life with the exception of diplomatic service in various countries. Besides these voice reproductions, we have data on all the important incidents in their lives. We have their IQs, their school records, the results of the psychological tests. We know their preferences in reading, in friends, in dress. All the things that made up their total personalities during life. But why...? Why do you need so much detail? Well, suppose while we're extending a subject's life, we discover cellular damage or some unforeseen damage to the brain. We have to replace those cells, you see? So we keep a supply of cells and tissues on hand for just such contingencies. That's fascinating. I had... I had no idea. - You're not feeling quite so...? - Squeamish as I was? No, I'm not. Frankly, I'd like to know more about cryo-biology. It's an interesting subject. I think you're gonna learn a great deal about it before we're through with Hagen Arnold. Colonel Cowen, you've met Dr. Craig and Miss Dennis. I don't think you know Dr. George Tarvin, the radiologist, or Dr. Tony Verity, a behaviorist who doesn't always behave. Dr. Crowther, you have Hagen Arnold's voice print? Yes, we do have it. Thank you, doctor. His last words. West will be destroyed in 14 days. Repeat, 14 days! - What does it mean, sir? - We don't know. "West will be destroyed in 14 days." By whom? He was in Sino-Asia. I think we have to assume he meant the Sinoese. That's ridiculous. Well, Hagen Arnold was too responsible a man to make such a statement without fact to back it up. Gentlemen, Miss Dennis, you are involved in the single most important project in the world today. For the West, this may well mean a matter of survival. Dr. Crowther? Sino-Asia. Now, the Sinoese, like us, have been trying to solve the problem of overproduction of people. We're running out of space. Now, we knew that, sooner or later, the uneasy peace between East and West would end. But all are agreed that thermo-nuclear war is out of the question. It was... It was just a matter of time before some other weapon, a means to impose the will of one side upon the other, would one day be found and used. We have reason to believe the Sinoese have such a weapon. But unfortunately, only one man knows for certain what that weapon is. And he, Hagen Arnold, has that awesome secret locked in his mind. We have ten days. Ten days? If it was ten months and then I'd give odds. We've had difficult assignments before. This project has top priority with every government in the West. George, you probably know more about holograms than any other man alive. Do you intend using laser holograms? I'd like to discuss that later. When we thaw Hagen Arnold out, we've got to able to keep him in one place without restraint as long as necessary. Tony, any ideas? You mean available? Any time of the day or night you might need him? That's a tall order. - That's why I brought you in. - Thank you. Well, to keep a man in one given place for any length of time, you have to create a state of apprehension. Excuse me, doctor, but will fear alone do it? No, we need more than that. Ideal situation is to get Hagen Arnold to believe he committed a crime. Crime? Why, it's been, well, at least three generations since we eliminated crime and violence. I know. I said the ideal situation. I'm laboring under a handicap, Dr. Crowther. I read the brief biography of Hagen Arnold, but I know very little about him. We can remedy that. Hagen Arnold, in the year 2100 at the age of 13. He'd already shown enough brilliance to attract the attention of the academic world. At the age of 20, he received his master's degree in history. I thought he was a geneticist. He took his degree in biology at the age of 16. Then he became so interested in history, he went on and took a degree in that. Arnold was widely recognized not only as a geneticist but also as an historian. In fact, he wrote and lectured on two decades: The 1950s and the 1960s. He was quite a man. Is. I forgot he was in that high-status refrigerator of yours. Hagen Arnold's 31, unmarried. I wish I knew more about the period Hagen taught. Break it up! Come on! Break it up! Break it up, come on! - Come on! - All right! What violence. When was that? Between 1965 and '68. We'll need a new matrix for Hagen Arnold. Yes, we will. Question is, what sort of matrix? I wish I understood all this. Matrix? A new personality, colonel. You see, Hagen Arnold's mind is as blank as a brand-new slate. We can program anything we want into it. Wait a minute. - Yes, sir? - Send Stover up, please. Yes, sir. You're aware, colonel, that before he left for Sino-Asia, Arnold was injected with a serum. The purpose of which was to block out memory in the event of extreme pain - at the hands of the enemy. - Yes. We have no idea what activated the serum. - Yes, sir? - Will you check the liquid nitrogen in Hagen Arnold's capsule? Yes, sir. I sent for Stover deliberately, colonel. I wanted you to see him. Stover is not his original name. He was one of our ablest military observers, but his plane was forced down in Sino-Asia. He fell into enemy hands and the serum was activated. We got him back but his mind was completely blank. So we gave him a new matrix. A whole new personality. I never knew. He looks so normal. He is perfectly normal. In every respect but one. His memories are not his own. In that sense, he is an artificial man. With Hagen Arnold, we have an entirely different situation. We can't do what we did with Stover because we wanna reach down deep into his subconscious mind. We don't wanna clutter things up with a lot of new data. We don't want any connecting link between the old life and the new. We want a new past, a new present, a new place, even a new time. Dr. Crowther, this new matrix... This new matrix must have a minimum of data. Just barely enough to let him function as a normal human being. All right, let's recap what we have so far. Hagen A. Confinement, fear, crime, historian. - Anything else? - The '60s. Those are inter-related. You're not thinking of making him a historian again? No, sir. We wanna use it if we can. Do you have any newspapers of the period? You've just had a glimpse of what's known as "the good old days." Please, go back. Not that. The one before. Let's see the story. That could be our matrix. Fear, crime, 1960s. - Where was the holdup? - Oakland, California. No good. For our purposes, we need a remote spot. Good locale. "Valley View, California, 1968." That's the present site of one of the country's largest kineries. Surrounding area is now completely remote. What in the world is that? That is what was called a farm. Believe it or not, people lived there and grew their own food. Colonel, could you duplicate that down to the last detail? If we had to. You have to. In that case, yes. In a few weeks. Not weeks, colonel. Days. What about details? Artifacts, clothes, utensils? Everything? Remember, it was 150 years ago. No problem. We'll contact every museum in the country, they'll fly down whatever we need in a matter of hours. Colonel, we have to be constantly aware of one thing. Hagen Arnold knows the '60s better than any of us can ever hope to. That means that when memories begin to rise from his subconscious, as we hope they will, one mistake, one overlooked detail, one wrong word can wreck the matrix. We'll be walking a tightrope, colonel. Every minute. Thaw is complete. Dr. Crowther? - Oscillator? - Normal. Stover, better get him ready. Will you bring him out now, please? - You all set, Lee? - Oh, yes. Miss Dennis and I will be in the cottage. Alan! Alan, it's the cops, come on! Come on, will you? Let's get out of here! - Hey, doc? - Is that you, Lee? - Doc. - You made it. There it is, a quarter of a million. Is that beautiful? Any trouble? - Jim Landon was shot. - Oh, no. Jim? You two don't know each other, do you? - Doc Crowther, this is Alan Fraser. - Hi, son. He's a good man, doc. Yeah. You drink? You look like you need it. A little booze will fix you up. - Where's my wife? - In the back. Sibyl? Sibyl? Is that you, Lee? Lee. Alan, you've met my wife. I'll just take care of this, I think. Don't you start drinking again. Alan? Alan, I wanna show you to your room. This is Doc Crowther's place. Just a few neighbors who mind their own business. We'll be okay here until the heat's off. You bunk in here. Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt this program for a special bulletin. Although it was reported earlier that the slain bandit was Alan Fraser, fingerprints identified the dead man as James Landon. The two escaping bank robbers took an estimated quarter of a million dollars. The police have no definite leads, but Chief Murdoch promises a break by morning. Hear about Jim Landon? - Who? - Jim. He's dead. Trigger-happy jerk. Cops thought it was you at first. Isn't that a laugh? Poor Jimmy. Oh, sorry. I didn't know you had company. Come in. Did you bring the car? Sure did. Hope you got money. Have we got money. This is Lee and that's Alan. This is Tony and George. Old friends of mine. Shake hands. - Hi. - Hi. Hey, five makes for a good game of poker. Right. If you'll excuse me, I'm tired. Come on. Play some poker. No, no, let... Let him go. You go ahead, kid. You go in there and sleep it off. Yeah. Sorry. Is he sedated? We gave it to him in a drink. - Is he convinced? - Not quite. Stop worrying. Alan Fraser. Alan Fraser. Continuation of preliminary report, Hagen Arnold. Tarvin speaking. These holograms are images of pictures to be transmitted by laser beam instead of shortwave or microwave. We can send any image or we can record any image. These images appear to the eye to be in solid form, although they're not. Crowther continuing. Before he left on his Sino-Asian mission, Arnold took a crash course in the Oriental language. For several months, he was shown symbols as a method of instruction. Now we believe that this instruction has conditioned his mind to receive holograms. So we are going to transmit the facts we have in the hope that when we get to the episodes we don't know about, our action will reactivate his memory. The laser pictograph, as Dr. Tarvin has indicated, will be our means of input and it will also show us exactly what is going on in Hagen Arnold's mind. We have processed all the information we have, we have a complete delineation of Hagen Arnold, including his physical dimensions, his traits and habits as known before he left the country. That's enough for Security, isn't it? They won't understand one word of it anyway. There's something we must be careful of, gentlemen. We cannot, we dare not subject him to more than four minutes of this at one time. Any longer will almost certainly result in brain damage. All right, Miss Dennis. What about his heart rate and blood pressure? Normal. He's in a REM state. Good. What you are witnessing now, gentlemen, in that amorphous mass of brain tissue, is the formation of an image of Hagen Arnold. So here we see Hagen's own image of himself. Like all of us, his mind contains a visual impression of himself which may or may not coincide with the truth. The image a man sees in his mirror is one thing, and what the mind sees filtered through the mechanism of his ego is often quite another. What we see now is a combination of Hagen Arnold's own impressions, plus the data we have fed into his brain. Tony, let me have the hologram recording of Raymond Hicks' office. Thank you. He was interviewed by Raymond Hicks the day he had to make his decision. Hicks was in charge of the Sino-Asia Division of the State Department. He and Arnold had only met once before. Mr. Arnold, you've been chosen for this assignment because you are one of the world's leading geneticists. Thank you. Do you believe it's possible the Sinoese are mass-producing male children? Yes, I do. This can have serious consequences. Well, in a few years, we'll have the same capabilities. But it may be too late. Perhaps this is just propaganda. It's possible. But we should know beyond the shadow of a doubt. I agree. This is our new method of teaching Sinoese. It's a little confusing at first. But you'd be surprised how much of it sticks. Now I must tell you of the risks involved. A volunteer is injected with a serum which, in event of capture and extreme pain inflicted upon him, is rendered unconscious. When he awakens, he no longer remembers who he is or anything of his past. What happens to the men who...? If a man escapes, we give him a new life, a new personality, new skills. We call it creating a new matrix. What I mean is, what happens to those who lose their memory and don't escape? We don't know. For instance, one of our best men, Gregory Gallea, has been missing for two years. Perhaps you'll find the answer. Well, Mr. Arnold? I'll go. - Ashley? - Yes, sir. All right, George. Well, it wasn't culture, but they do say it was popular. How's our star boarder this morning? Oh, chipper. He made breakfast. Something called bacon and eggs. Greasy. Oh, you're not leaving, are you? Dr. Crowther and I have got work to do. You're not gonna leave me here alone with...? Come here. Now, you won't be alone. I'll be in the barn. "Potato. Potato." Hagen Arnold, I know you're there. This is Gregory Gallea. Who? Where you off to, Alan? Let me go! I just went out the barn to see Dr. Craig. I only wanted to find out what a potato looked like. Miss Dennis, did you leave before or after the phone call? - Phone call? - Yes. The communicator said the phone rang, a man asked to speak to Hagen Arnold and identified himself as Gregory Gallea. Well, isn't that the man that Hagen was told to look for in Sino-Asia? - The one who was missing? - Yes. Lee, if it really was Gallea, either Security is lying to us or... - There must be some mistake. - No. The communicator monitored the call himself. He's positive. Come on, George. Wouldn't it be best to wait for natural sleep? No, we've got to find out what's going on. His training completed, Hagen Arnold's mission began. He proceeded to Sino-Asia by submarine, traveling at incredible depths to evade Sinoese sonar detection devices. Finally reaching a remote coast on the Asian continent, the submarine surfaced and Hagen said his goodbyes to the officers and men of the craft. We can only guess what determination it must have taken for Arnold to lower himself into that raft and paddle alone to the Sino-Asian shore. We know that his mission was to learn whether the Sinoese had indeed broken the genetic barrier, or if these reports were based on propaganda or mere speculation. From the sea coast, Arnold made his way somehow into the crowded city. At this point, the problem of escape and return must have entered his mind. Nonetheless, he not only persevered, he actually succeeded into insinuating himself into laboratories and hospitals. How he accomplished that incredible feat, we don't know. But he did see... He must have seen the progress of the Sinoese with his own eyes. Tony, Miss Dennis, would you check Arnold, please? And induce normal sleep? That told us very little we didn't already know. Gentlemen, there are only five days left. Colonel Cowen, are you sure Security is being quite frank with us? About Gregory Gallea. Oh, that phone call. It couldn't have been Gregory Gallea. He's listed as missing, he's probably dead. - Then who was it? - We don't know. Has it occurred to you that someone might wanna sabotage this project? Are you questioning our security methods? We've been working under great pressure. Lee, that is a pretty wild idea. - Nevertheless, there was a phone call. - What are you suggesting? Only that the matrix is being threatened. Now, surely you don't deny that, Dr. Crowley, do you? No, I don't. - Hello. - It's Gregory Gallea. Listen, Hagen, you've got to get out of there. Your life is in danger. Hello? Hello! Who was that? Nobody answered. - Nobody answered? - Nobody answered! That was a foolish thing to do with every cop looking for you. I don't like being cooped up. Well, you took a chance at being cooped up for 20 years. Why don't you get off my back? Crowther speaking. Yes? I see. Communicator says the same man called, gave his name as Gallea and warned Arnold his life was in danger. - Why did Hagen lie? - Let's not jump to conclusions. It was a warning. His reaction's perfectly normal. Well, what's gonna happen now? We'll have to clear this up. Let's get Security to call off the patrol and set up an ordam scanner so we can follow his movements if he leaves again. Who are you? What's wrong? Haven't you ever seen a kinery worker? Kinery worker? You're very strange. Did you come to work here? You couldn't. Not dressed like that. What's wrong with the way I'm dressed? - What's that? - Cigarette. - Cigarette? - Yeah, here. It's a cigarette lighter. You light your cigarettes with it. - Lighter? - Yeah. Hey, my name's Alan Fraser. Alan Fraser. I'm Karen Summers. What are you doing here? Well, I'm resting. I'm leaving tomorrow or the next day. Are you a 3R or T? 3R or T? Retraining, retired, reserved or transferred? I'm between jobs. - I'm an A. - An A? - Absent. - Absent? The kinery is not really a bad job. Sometimes it does get a little bit boring. But when you're really being disciplined... Disciplined? I don't obey rules. Do you? Well, if I did, I... I wouldn't be here talking to you now. Are you absent too? In a way. I see. What is a kinery? We process dairy products and reduce them to pills. Dr. Crowther. The ordam shows Hagen's made contact with someone. That must be our man. But there's only the people at the kinery. And that's five miles away. Have Security check the kinery. See if there are any absentees. Yes, sir. What's wrong? These buildings are from ages ago. The place is old. Nobody denies that. They don't build any like that anymore. - It's a laser gun! - Karen! Let me go, Alan! Run! Don't make a move. All right, up against the tree. Come on, get in the house! Come on, I just blasted a cop! I'll get rid of him. All right, Tyrell. Thanks. That's just what we wanted. Attention, SQ4. SQ4, the Overseer is coming to talk to you. Attention, SQ4. SQ4, the Overseer is coming to talk to you. You're to go with him. - Why? - No questions. - If it's about this morning, I can... - No more. Go. Where? She is a curious one, isn't she? She's been nothing but trouble ever since she came. Your belongings will be sent to you. Well, wherever it is, it can't be worse than this. Good riddance. You know, you're the only one who really belongs in a kinery. HA-513. HA-513. HA-513. "Sinoese solved secret of chromatin in nucleus of cells." I told you, I don't know anyone by the name of Gregory Gallea! Or Hagen Arnold. That name means nothing to you too, I suppose. I've been at the kinery a month. I hardly know the people I work with. So you met Alan Fraser. You talked. What about? Casual things. His neighbors, the people he stayed with. - Where he stayed... - You said... You said that you asked to see his house. - Why? - I was curious. You saw the house? Then what? I was about to tell him that such houses are no longer built when someone fired a laser gun at us. The only personnel with weapons are my men. Miss Summers, I don't wanna punish you. Now, why don't you cooperate? What lies do you want me to tell you? - I want the truth. - I told you the truth! - Miss Dennis. - Yes, sir? - Would you come in here, please? - Yes, sir. And where am I being sent this time? Nowhere. For the time being. Take her to her room. Yes, sir. Put me through to Colonel Holt at the Capitol. Yes, sir. Is... Is Alan all right? You're not to worry about him. And please, you're not to ask any questions. What's happening here? No questions. You're very pretty. Are you a sterry? Nope. I'm permitted to have two children when I get married. Synthitine? Thank you. Good night. If you see Alan, tell him it would be nice if we could meet again someday. Don't try to leave your room. They've posted an armed guard with orders to shoot. - Here's the whole message. - Thank you. "Sinoese solved secret of chromatin in nucleus of cells." - That's all? - Yes. Tell me, Lee. Between the time that Arnold sent this message about the Sinoese and their male babies, and the time that his plane reached the northern radar belt. Hagen wasn't heard from for over two months. Oh, well, no wonder they gave him up for dead. And what about this fellow that identified himself as Gallea on the phone? I checked with Central Data. Now, when Hagen's plane reached the radar belt, he reported having a copilot. But when they found the plane, Hagen was alone. And Security still insists that Gallea's dead? They're hardly ever wrong. I'm not going to hurt you. I'll release you if you promise not to make a sound. Nod if you agree. All right. Now we can talk. They have micro-mics and scanners planted all over. This forms a protective shield. I need your help. My name is Gregory Gallea. You said you need my help. Yes. You must help me get Alan away from here. Why? What did Colonel Cowen say to you? He asked me if I know you. And you said you've never heard of me and he said... Cowen's a fool. Who is Hagen Arnold? Alan Fraser. They're one and the same. That's why you are in danger. Danger? I only met Alan once. Hagen Arnold was in Sino-Asia. While there, he learned something which will cost him his life if we don't get him away from Dr. Crowther. Who? You haven't met the esteemed Dr. Crowther? He's one of the leading scientists in the West. But Hagen learned that Crowther and Sen Chiu planned an alliance which will deliver the West to Sen Chiu without a shot being fired. That's why Crowther brought Hagen here. To keep him from revealing the truth. He'll destroy Hagen's mind. That's the reason for all of this. The house of 150 years ago. The clothes. You stumbled onto it accidentally. Will you help me? Oh, you've seen too much. You know, you... They'll have to get rid of you. A trained, skilled killer is loose on a top-security project. Well, every member of my staff has been accounted for, colonel. I can personally vouch for all of them. Colonel Holt should fly down here immediately. Meanwhile, I'll tighten security so that you can work without interruption. Lower the protective shield for cremation. I want my share of the money. What did that old drunk do with it? Easy, Alan, easy. Listen, I'm sick of this place and of you! And that old lush with his cronies sitting around playing penny ante poker. I want out. - Couple of days. - Now! Bank robbery's one thing. Killing a cop is another. Now, I killed that cop to save your hide. The least you can do is wait. All right. A couple of days. Right. We'll split, and you can spend your share any way you see fit. Three more days. That's all we have left. We've searched the entire area. There's no sign of anyone. A man is dead and no sign of his killer. Now, there's answer to all of this and we'll find it, I assure you, Colonel Holt. You'd better, Cowen. Dr. Crowther, before I leave for the Capitol, I'd like to ask a favor of you. I'd like to see this experiment of yours. Oh, I'm afraid we've reached a very critical moment, colonel. Tonight will decide whether we're going to succeed or fail. But you said things were going fine. Well, they have been. But so far, all we've been doing is feeding in information we already have. Tonight, if our theory's correct, we hope that Arnold's brain will begin to tell us the rest of the story. Well, if this is going to be a historic night, all the more reason I should be there. - Why, yes, but... - Thank you, Dr. Crowther. Is he drugged? He's been given a mild sedative in his food. George? - He isn't responding. - This is what I've been afraid of. Do you realize how much time we have left? How little time, colonel. Yes, I do. This may be it. - Well, now, this thing really works. - Quiet, quiet. He's signaling someone. Gregory Gallea, I presume. So Hagen did find Gallea. This happened only months ago. Doctor, you're to be congratulated. Welcome, Mr. Arnold. I am Sen Chiu. What's wrong? I can't see Sen Chiu's face. Adjust it. We can't see it because Arnold's having trouble remembering what he looks like. We only see what Arnold remembers. You are surprised, Mr. Arnold, that I know of you. You are as well known to us as in your own country. I myself have read your books and articles, and I have found your theories most useful. What have you done to Gallea? Why worry about him? You have been here for several months. Are you impressed by what you've seen? Yes. And no. A curious reply from an Occidental. I've seen progress and feudalism side by side. Feudalism. You Occidentals are so fond of that word. Well, we shall show you what a feudal people can do. We will conquer you. What do you say about us? Yes. We are inscrutable, indeed. I shall not disappoint you and will remain inscrutable and tell you, Mr. Arnold, that we shall conquer the West. You find that amusing? Frankly, I do. You will not provoke me into revealing what I have in store for your people. The age of secret weapons is long gone. Our scientists know as much as yours. And vice versa. I won't quarrel. Perhaps, perhaps not. I would only say that we in Sino-Asia will do as you did when you first harnessed nuclear energy. We shall use whatever we have, as you did. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Arnold. What is this plan Sen Chiu spoke about? - We'll soon see. - I'm afraid not. Time's up. No, let it continue. Sen Chiu never boasts. Let the hologram continue a little longer, doctor. Can't risk brain damage. - I insist. - I'm sorry, George. Let it continue. That's an order. - You'll destroy him! - You hear me? That's an order! Thanks. Put that on. - What is this place? - Underwater prison colony. They've had them for years. Land's too valuable to waste on convicts. Besides, they grow some of the food here for those above. All set. Let's go. Help! Help! Gallea was his copilot. If we can get through the Sino-Asia radiation defenses, we'll be home free. Higher. Higher, Hagen! It's our only chance. Alan. What happened? I... I think you must've had a nightmare. You all right? Something in my head. I've never had such pain. Lie down, Alan. Can you describe this pain? Something seemed to explode inside my head. As if... As if something locked inside wanted to break out. Well, you'll be asleep very soon. What went wrong? Was it the extension of time? There's no point in recriminations, colonel, or trying to place the blame. Oh, come on, doctor. I want straight answers, not evasions. All right, then, it could have been the extension of time, in which case, of course it was entirely your fault. In all fairness, I must say it could've been a hundred other factors. We still have a full day. I'm sorry, we don't. For us, time's run out. I refuse to admit defeat. Look at these, colonel. Look at them. These were taken the very moment the image of the brain appeared in the pictograph. Notice the spindles. They're different from anything we've recorded. They show violent discharges, delta rhythms that indicate changes in the cortical neurons. Would you please translate that into language I can understand? Obviously, the sensor in Hagen Arnold's brain's subconscious tried to prevent the conscious mind from revealing the truth. So the subconscious came into his room? Well, put in those words, it does sound fantastic. At least he admits it. Well, doctor, I appreciate this lecture, - but I see... - Look at these lines, colonel. Colonel, the lines on these EEGs are impulses, aren't they? Impulses which we measure electrically. - In other words, energy. - All right. Then you do admit the brain is capable of producing a form of energy? - Yes, I understand, but... - Why...? Why cannot this energy, under certain circumstances, become so strong it develops its own motive power? - To move at its own will? - Yes. Why not? There is still one-third of the brain that's an absolute mystery to us, colonel. I submit to you that the phenomenon we saw in that room is really a form of energy created by Hagen Arnold's brain. Next you'll be talking about the id and the superego. Call it anything you like. I believe our use of holograms released an energy and that that energy now stands between us and the truth. Thank you, doctor. But I still have a job to do. Why don't you stop behaving as though you're pushing tin soldiers around on a battle map, colonel? We have failed. It's over. Defeat is not in my vocabulary. - Colonel, what Dr. Crowther is... - You stay out of this. You listen to me, Dr. Crowther. You heard Hagen's warning. The fate of the West rests in our hands. Our very existence is at stake. Now, if you're not going to do the job, I'll get someone who will. - That's your prerogative. - I know your reputation. But you can be wrong too. I'm relieving you of duty, doctor. Dr. Craig, take over. - But, Colonel Holt... - Now, I don't want schoolboy loyalties. - I'm giving you an order. - Yes, sir. Colonel, what about the girl? From the kinery. She was to be taken... We'll worry about her later, after we're finished here. Dr. Crowther, I don't want this job. Well, you'll have to give it a try, Lee. Is there a chance? You heard the colonel. I could be wrong. We're wasting our time. It's no use, sir. Is there anything else we can do? Well, I've injected Hagen Arnold with neural hormones. That's the only thing we hadn't tried, beyond that... We've got to find out what that message meant. We've tried. As far as I can see, not hard enough. There's resistance, and that resistance is in Hagen Arnold's brain. Dr. Crowther was right. I'm not interested in who's right or wrong. I want results. There's nothing else we can do. You've got to reconcile yourself to that fact. It'll be a cold day in hell before I ever get involved with scientists again. We've got to keep Hagen Arnold under until the powers that be decide what to do. What will happen to him? Time will run out in a matter of minutes. What will happen to all of us? I have to get Hagen out tonight, while he's still alive. The head of Security's here. Crowther won't take the chance of his finding out what's really going on. Now, will you help? You've got to decide now. I... Are you convinced now, colonel? Why was he in your room? Do you know who he was? I asked you a question. - Colonel Holt... - I'll thank you not to interfere, doctor. All right, Miss Summers. He was Gregory Gallea. He's been identified. I wanna know your connection with him. He was trying to help Hagen escape. Why? He said Dr. Crowther was trying to destroy him. Dr. Crowther was trying to destroy Hagen Arnold? Because Hagen found out about the agreement Dr. Crowther made to deliver the West to Sino-Asia. So that's why you failed, because you had to. Ask her if Gallea told her what happened between the time he and Arnold left Sino-Asia and the time we found their plane. That's all he said. Doctor, you're under arrest. It's absurd. How could I make an agreement with Sino-Asia? I'm a scientist. And what would I gain? We'll let a board of inquiry determine that. - With you at the head of it? - All you've got is this girl's word. Under the present circumstances, that's enough. Cowen, take the girl to her room. All right, Dr. Tarvin, cremate the body. No, don't! Don't destroy the body. This may be our chance. Chance? For what? Gallea and Arnold were together. They share the secret. Doctor, this man is dead. He's stone-dead. - All right, Tarvin... - Wait. The body is clinically dead, that's correct, colonel, but the brain cells are alive. Lee. No, no, no. Wait a minute. If we oxygenate quickly, there's a chance, colonel. A slim chance. Look at it this way, colonel. You have nothing to lose. If necrosis hasn't set in, if the skull fracture hasn't destroyed too much tissue, we may succeed. In getting a dead man's brain to reveal information? Yes. By the same use of holograms. All right, doctor. As you say, I have nothing to lose. But consider what you have to lose. Laser. Power. Power on. Slow surge. Power off. Well, that's all the information we have to feed in. Now we'll see if the brain's going to respond. To Vector 7 aircraft, identify. Identify, please. Hagen Arnold. Request landing instructions. Yes, Hagen Arnold. Please give code. HA-513. Roger, 513. Congratulations. Gave you up as missing. - Are you alone? - No. Am with copilot. Identify copilot, please. To HA-513, please identify copilot. To HA-513, please identify copilot. Repeat. Please identify copilot. HA-513, are you reading me? Over. What's wrong? Do you recall your conversation with Sen Chiu? Yeah. The West expects some new secret weapon. A satellite bomb, perhaps. A new missile? The Sinoese have created the least expected weapon in this age. A bacterial culture combining all the plague diseases of the Middle Ages. The smallpox. Cholera. Bubonic. So, what can they do with it? Our scientists destroyed disease, all disease, decades ago. Exactly. Panic. Panic, Hagen! Because whole generations have not even known sickness, there will be panic such as this world has never seen. We still have the antitoxins. The vaccines. That's true, Hagen. That's true. But only if they knew to use them. In addition to the plague bacteria, the injection will also induce pain. You understand me, Hagen? Enough pain to destroy your memory. Good God, Gallea activated the serum. No one will suspect Hagen Arnold, the carrier triggered to destroy them. Millions will die before your scientists realize what's happened. Chaos, Hagen. The West will be paralyzed with fear. So that's what Sen Chiu meant. And the capture? The rescue, the escape, that was all part of it. We were waiting for you, Hagen. You're a living, breathing bomb of death. Set to go off in 14 days. You're a defector. A traitor. I was captured. Life, Hagen. Any life is better than having my mind destroyed. The West will be destroyed in 14 days. Repeat, 14 days... The 14 days were up hours ago. Every one of us has been in contact with Hagen Arnold. Cowen, let's go. - Where are you going, colonel? - The Capitol. Oh, to spread the diseases? You heard Dr. Verity. The 14 days have elapsed. We are all of us now infected. The West is saved, I'm happy to say, gentlemen, but we, personally, are lost, I'm afraid. Crowther speaking. I'm posting a quarantine on this entire complex. - If anyone tries to leave, shoot him. - Yes, sir. - By what authority? - Oh, shut up, Holt! You're forgetting yourself, Cowen. I'm in command here. Then have Dr. Crowther do something. Dr. Crowther, you can't just let us die. Oh, it can't be helped, unfortunately. But if we all keep our heads, I think we can confine these diseases to our own little group. Our own little group? We must remain absolutely calm. The fever will come on slowly. At first, it'll be hardly noticeable. Then there'll be physical signs. Swelling, sores, bone-crushing pain. Oh, my God. The dead must be cremated by their surviving companions who will, in turn, of course, be disposed of by their survivors, and so on. Clothing should be burned also. Ultimately, the buildings. Until finally, the last man dies in what will be, I'm afraid indescribable agony. I'd rather be shot. So would I. Wait. Colonel, I apologize. I... I... I'm terribly sorry. I... I apologize to you both. I... There is something I've overlooked. I... I'm really quite ashamed of myself. It's so obvious. Hagen Arnold was frozen. We know that, doctor. The virus was inactive. For seven days, including the time it took to build this farm. Now, wait a minute. We don't know if the Sinoese didn't infect another man and smuggle him in. It's unlikely, but, of course, they might try again. We have seven days to find the antitoxin. - That'll be easy. - What's not so easy, Lee, is to distribute it to every man, woman and child in the West. Can that be done in seven days? The Earth was created in six, colonel. We'll need a specimen of Hagen Arnold's blood. Tony, you must contact every laboratory in the country. Have them make their facilities available immediately. Thank you. Will he be the same? Except for a few minor details, exactly the same. We've given him a new mind, of course. And you'll have to get used to calling him David. David. Why? David Graham. He's an engineer now and he has a wife named Karen. That's his new matrix. It's perfectly legal. Your marriage was registered three days ago. Do you mind? No, not at all. Thank you. He's the one ought to be thanking me. Here he comes. Hello, you. Hi. - We haven't met before, have we? - I came to see you in the hospital, but you were in no condition to remember. I'm Dr. Crowther. Very nice meeting you. I imagine you two would like to get along home now. You remember the address? Oh, yes. My mind's absolutely clear now. Memory's perfect. I wish mine were. Well, if there's anything you've forgotten, Karen, I'm sure David will be more than happy to remind you. Thank you, doctor. Gallea was an incredible man. Incredible is an understatement. Strange. He'll reveal more to us dead than he would've dared alive.
