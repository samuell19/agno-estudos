Dear Cezinha, you son of a bitch, You know you're very important for us all, I want to tell you... that you don't deserve to be in this hell. We care very much for you. You can be sure we won't let you down. I've been trying hard to find your family but it hasn't been easy. I promise you I'll do my best to find someone. Let me know how you've been doing. I'm working hard and trying to change for the better. I'm doing some construction work with Jader. Remember when we used to work fixing pools? I'm still doing that. And I'm also doing tiling in Água Branca and Nova Lima. Oh! Mr. Foicinha came by and brought me the summons. So now I have to go and sign it at the district once a month... and that's why I can't come over to see you. I delivered your letters to the others... and Werlei said he would send you a kite, and Adilson said he would send the other stuff. And we're all worried about you. People are always asking about you. Chinai and Marlon are all good; and so are Marcelo and The Kid... and we're all hoping you'll get a provisional release or even parole. So that you can be free... and sign the black book every month, just like I've been doing. It's not all that bad but you can't miss a date... If you do they'll put you back inside. As for the hood, it's just the crackheads stealing to buy rocks and get high Other than that, it's the same old shit... And now it's all about fighting for better days for us all. Hang in there, right brother? We're in this together. I won't forget you. Remember the psalm: peace, justice and freedom. It's us. THE HIDDEN TIGER That's it. 13. - What's up, Junior? - What's up, man? They're hiring here. Yeah, right? - What's up, bro? - What's up, man! A guy asked me to give you this. Cool. Take care! Junior?

You lame ass! - Look, right in your head! - What kind of gun is that? It's my shotgun. Oh, no! You know what I'd really like, man? I'd like a shotgun to put against someone's head, like this and pow! Blow out someone's head, the brains spillin' out and the guy lying there... Better than that, it'd be a cop! He'd come at us and we'd shoot him in the head, blow his brains out, man! No, no, even better! I wanna have a gun with endless bullets, man. I'd hit the streets and kill everyone... Pow, pow, pow... And what if one of your relatives gets in the way and you kill him? I don't give a fuck! I don't give a shit, man! I'd kill 'em all. But then the shots would have to be low not to wake you up! Go fuck yourself, I'll shoot you in the head. - Quit that shit!? - I ain't messing around. Check it out! Hey man, can you check if my T-shirt is over there? It's a black Kiss one. Kiss? Kiss. Kiss.

Damn, it ain't funny no more, man. You don't know shit. That's ridiculous. You're pathetic, dude. Junior... is garbage. "I want to cut it off, I want to chop it up..." "Get the guillotine to Fernandinho chop him into pieces" "I spent my childhood in the Young Offenders Institutions," "messed around a lot" "Getting used to torture is always hard, and the snitch is always the same" "In my house there ain't no Plasma or LCD TV, the snitch fooling at the lan house, check it out".

Damn you wanna cut that, Junior? No, I'll cut it in half. Don't fuck with me, man. Remember when your hair was like that, man? It was so fucking ugly. My hair was the coolest in the hood, in Brazil, and in the world. You destroyed the orange. Fuck it. Asshole. You don't know shit. You're the one who don't know shit, asswipe. What do you know? What do you do? Who the fuck are you? Come on Nigga, I've never even seen your name on a matchbox. What about yours? Not even on the electricity bill. I've not even seen yours on a match. Not even on an ice pop. I've never seen "Nigga", never. - Chickenshit. - You're nothing but an asshole. You're the hole-ass, you know nothing. Listen Nigga, you think you know more than me? Of course I do. You don't know more than no one, man. I do. - Let's see, then. - Then let's see. What's up, Nigga? What's up, asshole? Didn't you say you were the gangsta? Didn't you say you knew it all? Ain't you the gangster from New Jersey? You said you were the best. I'm better than you, asshole. Better than who? Who do you think you are? How are you better than me? Here, look at this, the bullet got in here... went through here, and stopped here, they had to cut it open with a scalpel. This other one here, see? Take a look and see. It got in here and it left through here. Shit. - What about you? - I have this one, man. I got hurt at home. Did your sister stab you? Over here, man. - What's that? The Devil's fork? - No, man. Here, look. - That one is too lame, man. - Yeah, I know. - Too lame. - There's this one too. - Mine's much cooler. - Eek. You only got that one? And another one in the foot, and on my thigh I have a bullet lodged here... Fuck, man, you're full of holes, all shredded. What about you, what have you been through? I fucked some women. What? You hardly fucked that faggot down the street. You're messing with me. So let's see who's boss, which phone is cooler? - Mine's cooler than yours. - Mine is better than yours. You got songs in yours? No, 'cause I ain't got a memory card. - So it's worth shit. - Yours is worth shit. Yours is nothing but trash. Yours is trash, found at a hot dog stand. Let's see, then. "I'll mess with Nigga". You're shitting me. "I'll mess with Nigga". "And the worst is the clothes, Nigga only wears famous brands" "And Junior ain't got no clothes to buy and he walks around with his drugdealer shorts" "Listen Nigga, I'm gonna tell you, I know all your clothes were bought at the Flea Market" "And your clothes are so old, I know you found them on the streets" "I could only think about Nigga in the guillotine, I'll mess with you and your stinkass shorts" "And you're a shit-faced asshole, these shorts ain't worth shit" - "And Junior gets shot in the head" - "But Nigga has a kilo of dope" "And Junior's smoking a kilo of pot".

"I know Nigga's sister ain't no good" "And Junior got fucked in the ass by the drug dealer," "I found out and now I'm gonna tell everyone" "Got fucked, got fucked..." "...in the ass by the drug dealer" Fuck you, asshole. - Damn Nigga! Motherfucker! - Fuck you! Damn Nigga. You're the biggest motherfucker. - Not all over me, man. - Yeah, man. Yeah. Alright, squeeze as much as you can. Now it's really cool. Really cool... Now you'll see something, Nigga. Motherfucker. - No. No. No. - Now you'll see. Damn you, no!

Enough? - Just give up. - Never! - Give up! - Never! - Give up! - Never, motherfucker. You'll die. You're gonna die, then. - Drop it. - You're close to death! Surrender! No! Surrender! You're about to die. But you're gonna hit the lamp post head first. - Will you surrender? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I'll poke them both out. - Yeah! Let go of me. - Say you give up! - Deal! - Say you give up! - No! Give up! OK, I give up. So who died? I killed you, sucker. It's the devil's fork, you miserable fuck.

Follow the triumphant march, be brave" "Look to our beloved, Lord Jesus, who leads us on to victory" "Be brave" "Be brave, struggling for Jesus," "be brave, never rejecting the cross" "Always steady in your love, full of his spirit," "be brave" Hey Mauricio! - What's up bro? - What's up? Get over here, man. What are you up to? Man, I was looking for your house, but it was really hard to find. I asked a bunch of people, and they were like... "head over there, then over there, near the bar over that way", damn. Got tired, walked like a crazy fool. But I finally found you. - I brought something for you. - For me, bro? - Yeah, man. - Are you serious, dog? Yeah, I am, see if it's worth something. Damn, you bet. I really needed a skateboard, man. I heard your mom broke yours and set fire to it. Yeah... Now you can ride with the other guys. Damn straight, damn straight! I know you like rock, but I heard you're listening to rap now... - So I brought you some "Snoop". - Hey that's cool. That's cool, man. I sanded it down a little. You got the trucks from the other one, right? Yep. You did this? Yeah, man. - "Mix"? - Yeah. Mixtsubishi?

And another one over there? Yeah, and one in the corner. And the same thing on the other side. A pipe there and another one here, got it? The belt will hold it all down. There'll be a slab over there, for the bathroom. I need to fix the slab here so that I can get out of there. And then I'll fix everything together.

I was down at the bus point the other day, and one of them showed up saying I had to pay it back. I told him I was working hard to get him the money. I'd like you to head up there and hand him the money, man. Give him this. - Is everything here? - No, not yet. There's just some of it. - But dude, what if they get pissed? - No, that ain't gonna happen. I talked to him already. I said I was gonna send what I've got now. I'll send the rest later.
