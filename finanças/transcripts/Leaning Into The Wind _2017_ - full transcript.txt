I'm trying to understand the process of how something is made. It's eh... to know... more than just the technique. And then this is so strong and so ingrained with the presence of people who have been here. It is slightly... it is uncomfortable, it is a bit too personal in a way when you come in to a place... when you're looking into people's lives in a very profound way. So... This is the first time I have ever seen avocado in a tree, in my life. That she likes very much to have people here but she is sad because she cannot communicate. There is no way, I am polite. Yeah it's here. Ah. Uh-huh. Okay. Just a... Yeah, they use a lot of bullshit to... Really. Bullshit mixed with clay. Oh yeah. The bullshit because of the fibers. Yeah, I know, I understand. It's a very beautiful floor. I can imagine. - Would you like it? - Yeah. This is even more beautiful. Not quite. Did you guys have white finger? White finger? You know that tingly feeling in your fingers? - I, ah... - You never had that? You get it a little bit but either your brain just cancels it out after so many years or... Or ah... I got it from stone. I do a lot of stone cutting. Yeah. Countersink those bolts so that there... Something like that... I fell out of a tree when I was fourteen and I had my shoulder bolted back. - Can I feel it? - Yeah, you can! It's gross. Where my finger is. Oh yeah. So I kinda identify with the bolt in back. Oh look you got one too, yeah! - Look at that! Yay! - You do? - You really do? - Oh yeah. Wow. - Yours is bigger than mine! - Yeah. All right. ...this way. I can... lift it up from the ground from here, if you want. So he's gonna need to retract we are gonna move it that way. Can you grab the camera? Yep, do you want me to take it under it? But let's keep going, but if we hear cracking... It's gonna go. I don't think you are gonna hear much cracking. It is just gonna go bang. Alright should we try and... Should you guys be wearing safety glasses in the event that something... To see if it's possible or not. It's so close, isn't it? I'm gonna bring some buckets into the other room. Now the hair is done by someone else here, so... Like me? No, you do this, or you do the hair, or whatever. It feels strange but enjoyable. There's a lot of variation in texture. I think this one came from a beard. That's so weird. You got to figure out what salon it is from. Yeah I really want to know! I really think that that was my hair. It looked like it. That's amazing. That's amazing. You know, it's freezing for two weeks, and then... How much you've got? I don't know whose it is. It's gallery, you know. - It's very... - Yeah. It really feels like... There are a lot of contradictions in what I make in... in... in a sense, and I... I quite... ehhh... What I am trying to say is a really difficult thing to... to explain, but I think that when I was younger, it was... This is how I make my work, I work with nature, I do this and I make these sculptures, and I work with... And there is kind of a procedure... Now it's... You know, nature's everywhere! So what... you know, so why even mention it. You know, when I work in the city I work with nature. I work with myself, I'm working with nature. When I... you know... It... it isn't so clear anymore. And I am still just trying to make sense of the world. I come to this place time after time and I don't know how many years I've been working here now. And it's just a thin sliver of trees and a burn running through. I passed by it for a good number of years. Huge dramas occurring here. Elms are being killed by the Dutch elm disease. You know it's a complex place, so I continuously... And I feel that I am going deeper and deeper into the... into the place. And when the big elm tree fell, many years... several years ago. You think where will this end? When I first started working with the tree, it still bore all the evidence of the fall, and the violence of the fall, and the sharpness and... and cracks, and the tears. You know, you could feel that impact. These were the very first works I made, which... looking at the crack and... beginning to look inside the tree, look inside that event of the... of the fall... This was another incredible, this was an amazing day and the color was so intense. Thank goodness that the light was right on this day. That one was complicated. That one was so... I can almost still remember the irritation of having to make that, you know. That was the major break, that was... such... such an aggressive tear. Some are like cracks, some are like tears... And then in winter I filled the cracks with snow. This is with hogweed. If you split it open, it's white inside and it's a line that's... held with thorns to the tree, drawing... drawing the tree... These were yellow elm... elm leaves. The best yellow leaves that I get come from a tree that fell into a... into a kind of a swamp, a bog... and then grew back, drawing... nourishment from the bog or the water, you know, revived. There... There is a perception that yellow is... is... is a kind of a pretty color, and obviously for me it's bound up in the yellow of the elm, is bound up in the ability of that tree to survive. It is an expression of life. Gradually, the yellow has drained out of the landscape that I work with, through the trees dying. So I have got less yellow to work with now than when I came here thirty-odd years ago. It's a bit like a painter going to their studio every day and a little bit yellow... less yellow each day. Some years the yellow, it kind of... You can see it building up, this... this hum of color, getting richer and richer, and richer and richer and it... it... it sometimes reaches a peak in this incredible color and at other times... you can see it rising out of the tree, the color. And then... a wet night... followed by an intense frost and everything has gone black, on the tree, all the leaves are black on the tree, dark. And then as the... as the sun rises, they all drop off, and the death is instant. And the yellow is gone. That's it. And I can be left high and dry, with a whole heap of works I'm engaged in, and it's gone, the color's gone. So I can never take that for granted. I can never take the yellow for granted so it's a very intense relationship with the color. Which I love. I love, and even though it really is upsetting when the color is gone overnight. I still love the fact that it happens. I went to art school at Lancaster, so I stayed in Morecambe in '74, '75 I think. This is where I began working as an artist, outside, with the land. And I did a lot of work on this, this... this particular area. And I would pass this spot most days. These graves that are carved into the... into the bedrock. It is as if the storm has... absorbed the body. Well, they have. The stone has the absorbed the body. They... they're part of the rock and... and that human presence is very... very strong, obviously. It was a great place to learn. What I also like is that they are all so individually... This one is just square. Yeah, some of them have shoulders on them and they fit the head. You feel a human presence here and whether that's death or life, I think it's both. And I think that the chambers that I've made... for people to stand in, to lay in, are places to contain... memory, the human presence. And that will inevitably, umm... address the ideas of death and the absence. So that was really what those sculptures were about, a very personal... response to this area. An area which now I don't live anymore but I did feel a deep connection to. On Clougha Pike you can see Morecambe Bay where I've worked many times. You can see the Lake District, where I worked many times. You can see the church I got married in. I've left my presence in those places. I like to think of them in terms of... being containers for not my own memory, but the memory of time that is going to happen after I made the works and that they become richer over time... through time. The anticipation of working with this tree for the rest of my life, was... is... very strong. There is a strong sense of "Where will this lead?" "What will I make? What will happen?" As it... goes from being these cracks to soft shapes, as it melts into the... into the... into the place, and there is... there is no doubt that the remains of that tree would outlive me, you know. And... I came there, it was probably three... three years ago. I forget now... And the... the wood cutters had cut all the limbs on one side and taken them away. All those incredibly big limbs that were laying... splayed over there. Were gone. I... it was like such a shock. I mean, I don't tend to cry very often, but I did weep and it was not for the tree it was for me. And it's part of all of that... social nature of the place and the uses of the landscape that I have to come to terms with but none the less it was a great, great shock. And a huge sense of loss. And... The blacks... the absence of... where all these limbs were. I guess that's one of my classc 'in mourning' works. A memory of that, of those limbs. And... when it snowed again, I made a white snowball. And at that time I really didn't know how I would respond to the tree. Tina said, you have to think of it as phantom... phantom limbs, where you have this feeling in something that is no longer there because it did feel like that. It was as if my hand had gone and you are still looking there... I kept looking at the place where... where these trunks were, that I knew so well, and they were gone. We all have to deal with loss and... The work that I have made here has spanned some... fairly... difficult years of my life. And well, all years have their own difficulties and... And so when I walk up here I see the... I remember the works that I made, the particular times and the memory of that. Not just the making, but what was happening in my life at that time, are embedded in... in those works as well. I'm bound up in this place. It just makes sense of my life, what I make. It makes sense. You have... You have... I suppose, an idea of how your life will be when you set off when you're young and... it has a certain course that you feel it should take... and then... separation from... from... from Judith, and divorce and then her death, those were... emmm... major... major upheavals and... emmm... in life and... And then meeting Tina and having Joel. I have five children and the youngest is four. And the oldest is... twenty-seven, I think. So it doesn't have that same sort of... standard passage that I sort of expected. It's all been kind of mixed up a little bit and... I... I think that that possibly is also what occurred in my work. That it isn't so clear any more. You know the... that I am... And it just opened up this whole world of opportunities and way of looking at things. You know, you can walk on the path, or you can walk through the hedge. And there's two different ways of looking at the world, totally different. And I think that's the beauty of art. That it just makes you step aside off the normal way of walking or looking. My hands went so cold. And... I must have, I dunno if I cracked my rib or something, but I had this... it was quite painful. And the cold and the pain, and the... struggle. And then there was one really wonderful moment, where you know, I kept... I was caught and I couldn't get out and Holly said "Dad, it looks great, you can do it." And I managed to... When your child is actually telling you, encouraging you... That's a great, great, great moment. Then I got out of the hedge and I was just... I was just hypothermic almost. I was shivering and... and it took me about... half an hour to get my heat back. And then I went and did another one, you know. It really made everything much worse. I had such sore ribs for about three months afterwards. It was really... I didn't know what was... Anyway, it's fine now. It's heavy! Well, it's early days with Holly working with me. And there's something about someone you know very, very well, like your child. That there can be his state of telepathy which is beautiful. Also... because you are very close can have other problems because of that. But, so you never quite know if it's gonna be this thing that's... work or not. Am I easygoing now, Holly? With old age? I don't know! With old age! I'm not that old yet! But... yeah... I don't know. You think I am easier-going now than I was? - No - There you go. I'm not. I'm probably worse. - Probably worse. - Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna do... You'll need to get on my shoulders. Oh. My goodness, watch your neck. - I know. - Oh God! Ah, there we go. No problem. And where is it going? - On that branch up there. - This? Is it on? Okay. Oh. It's on. Right. Another one. There we go. Must we pull it down? Okay. Got it. Got it. Got it. Great! I love an overcast, grey calm day. It's like time just stops for a little while. And it's a relief. Okay. I want to clean it underneath too. Now the other way. No, don't drop it. Okay. Great. That I can feel this powerful sense of movement, change and... and nature there. And I feel it in the city too. Perhaps my... the way I've looked at the city has changed in that respect. I just see these people, walking, this movement, this life, this... people dying, getting older, the age range, the river of people as they walk over the pavement. And they're part of that change and... and... and... rhythm that... has... is ingrained in the city in some way. In the pavement. How are you doing? By working with the leaves, you understand the tree. By working with tree, you understand the earth that it's grown through and the space that it has grown in, and it's about that particular space, and it's come out of that space. The stone has a geological... story to tell, as you work with it and understand. Whereas a city, there isn't that kind of lineage in the same ways. So, that idea that, just below this concrete and the tarmac, and the gardens and the suburbs, lay... those places still. You know. And I think it is that kind of... wanting to... find the... the... go beneath the surface of the city to find the nature. Look at that! Wow! Oh! That's amazing, isn't it? Look at that. It's very human that, isn't it? Yeah. You can see the... the soldier ones, with the teeth, just watching, and there like centered. There is one here, there is one there. Like every so often, just to keep everybody in line, I guess. They're police. Everybody else is moving, apart from the... the ones with the teeth. Elephants and buffaloes. A stupid cow with sharp horns and not very good eyesight. So what he says is... In the olden days and indeed still today this tree serves as a refuge. If you are being chased by a buffalo or by an elephant, you can get in there and hide within the roots. Seems very generous in a way, doesn't it? So delicate. And that's how they start growing. This cage that it creates is quite wonderful. And that people hide in there for... It actually gives it this kind of human dimension. That's a protection of the person inside. You can kind of identify with that. Being in that... that space. You can feel that. Woah! Steady! You know it's not really for the faint hearted, this landscape, is it, you know? It's tough to make a living as a farmer, I imagine. One of the most important environments for me in my formative years as an artist, was farming. Working on farms. Working physically. That's how I learned to do this. I did not learn this in the art school. I learned this in farming. Where you'd have to pick stones out of the field all day long or... wild oats or stack bales, or whatever, you know. It was very, very physical stuff. And... and... that rhythm of gathering, cutting, building, cutting, building, taking, stacking, gathering, cutting, building, cutting, building... The work is called Sleeping Stone. And the proposal is to make five. And the idea of a person sleeping in stone is a very powerful one. And... it's like sleeping inside the landscape, entering the landscape, and finding sanctuary in it. It's a very intimate... state, sleeping. What... What I was thinking of doing was actually digging into the... cutting into the bedrock. And that's a big deal for me to do. I've never ever cut into the bedrock. When you take stone from the quarry or a boulder, or loose stone, it's on this journey. It's left the... the bedrock. It's a big step when you actually cut it, into itself. To be honest, I don't know if I can do it. I don't know. I just feel this... this... doesn't feel... doesn't feel right, to do it. It just doesn't feel right. To go against the place. Perhaps I am just thinking too much but... I don't... I don't know if I can do it. I really don't know if I can do it. And I came here this morning, and my saw is here and I'm on the site. And I'm ready to go and I can't do it. Sorry to have got you up so early. They've traveled, they've been... brought here by ice. The idea of stone taking this journey and arriving in places, is really quite interesting. Early farmers used to talk about the boulders being devil seeds in the field. And that each year no matter how often they plough them, more stones would come up. So it's like the ground was growing stones. Probably a little small one... And then the farmer pulling them out of the field and... placing them into walls, and then the walls take on this sense of passage and journey and lines through the landscape. The people who made walls have passed by and through. So you are left with this ghost of a previously farmed landscape that is now wooded. And there is an implicit threat in walls. Wanting to claim things, to have things, to keep people off, to prevent animals coming out. There is like a nerve, you touch on a nerve. And also, the most obvious thig to do with the wall is to enter it, as a person to say I am a part of this wall. I am this wall. - You want to give it a try? - Yeah Because I really shouldn't be doing this that often. No you should not. The things that I do. I think your mother would really tell you off. We should take a look at this. Okay. How that's holding, I have no idea. Was it a big village? Yes. Five hundred. Five hundred people lived in this place. Yes, yes. Oh there's a scorpion! - No. - Look there! Scorpion, no? It was! It was that big. Python. A snake. A big snake. It was a scorpion. Be careful. - You be careful too. - No, you too. Yeah! Ahhh. - Oh, yes! - Yes! - Yes! - Look at that! Look! You're right. Are you feeding the animals? There's a fire on the back. Yes. Yeah but it's always like this. You end up... you go to a building and you start looking at every... You know, things around and you try to read what was there and how people moved and walked and what was going on. It's quite big isn't it? Oh, it's raining. It really is. You know it's always been frustrating that I have only been able to do one hand because my other hand has to be the hand that puts the petals on. But now that Holly works with me, I... Eh... There couldn't be any closer than one of your own children to do... and it's a very odd sensation to let anybody do my work. Eh... and Holly is very good at it but there is also a feeling of being cared for or... Bandaged or the wound, you know, especially with something as red as this. It's eh, a very interesting... kind of role to be in. Yeah, you know, I am helpless. And a... which is difficult for someone like myself who doesn't delegate well the making of things. And I think what really... not makes it worse, because it's great, but Holly does a far better job than me. I mean, look at that thumb. Isn't it great? That's... that's my... That thumb is my... is red skin. That's a little more... You know... She's got an amazing touch and feel for materials. Plus she was saving all the good ones for when she was coming up! I didn't have those. They are really good big ones. When the wind picks up, that dries. Yeah... You are really showing me up here, aren't you? There's a wonderful addition to all the works that I've made. That sense of one work connecting to another, to another, to another. People think that... perhaps I should have... This, such a deep understanding of nature that I just somehow float and glide through it effortlessly. Well, it's not like that, and I fall, a lot. And trip over. Well, you know. And I think learning to fall is important. You know the work where I am leaning into the wind, is... is this wonderful sort o, tension with the wind. It's beautiful. It's a really... that moment... when you're held there suspended, is a very beautiful moment. And... And those are the moments that I strive for, struggle for. In everything that I do, in one way or another. Those moments where... it's just held there in this kind of, sense of balance. It's a... moment of understanding and clarity, in a very chaotic situation. Suddenly it becomes clear. I think a good work is a moment of clarity. It's not this kind of moment of mystery. It's like a shaft of light that just penetrates and for a moment it's very clear. And then it all become unclear again, but these kind of moments are just quite astonishing. And it's inexplicable. It's not something that you can put into words. But if you think back over your life, there will be certain moments in which... it felt very clear and very beautiful and made sense.
