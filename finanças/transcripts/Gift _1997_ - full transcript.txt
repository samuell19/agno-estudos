Here is the strawberries for her! - Strawberries? - Yeah, this is the King of Strawberries Are these delicious? Of course! How much do you think it cost? 8 million.

She?s in Primary 2 Where does she live? After the divorce, with her father Hmm ... the lawyer. That?s strange. She had custody. She?s supposed to be looking after the daughter, isn?t she? Ah, it?s written here... ?The main girl character here is Aikawa Natsumi. 8 years old. The lawyer husband had come to collect the daughter and brought her home to live with him. He said Aiso isn?t fit to be a mother. So he?s thinking of fighting for custody of Natsumi?. It was all hush-hush about the custody battle. He?s taken her and won?t be giving her back. The other party?s a lawyer, there?s a slim chance for her winning this case. This looks like a dangerous job... How much is she paying? Five what? Five billion Five billion??? A mother?s love ... Dream on.. She?s forever causing havoc with her flings. She was given custody because she?s the mother of the kid. If she lost her, she?ll just be a movie star. The daughter is valuable to her. I?ll accept this job! Natsumi?s schedules? Right. If you don?t tell us, we won?t know how to pick her up. For example, the time when she finishes school, or when she goes for tuition... ... or if you know her friend?s name, that?ll help too. I don?t know any of these things. Eh? Because I?ve always been busy with work... ... I left everything about Natsumi?s affairs to the nanny. Go and get the info from them. What's going on? She said she didn?t know. Nothing at all? ... about her own kid?s life? How can it be? She?s too much ... Well then, can you go to Tamura?s? Tamura? Maybe he can get info about the lawyer, girl's father Eh ... Whan can he do... 'Eavesdropping' is a crime... I don?t get it. ?A woman and a man in bed. What?s wrong with that?? - "She?ll say that every time!" - " She?ll say exactly what she feels, won?t she?" "But she has an innocent little daughter, hasn?t she?" But it?s getting to the really interesting part now? Natsumi... You?re home. There was a call from the lawyers? association What ?you?re home?? I told you not to let her watch those variety programs! Sorry, my hearing?s not so good Go and buy a hearing aid. The most expensive one. Dad.. What is it? Mum still looks beautiful, isn?t she? There?s piano lesson today? You better get ready. I want to be beautiful too.. How is it? His house is big. How about the other one? What? Don?t pretend ignorance. I left a message in your answering machine about something I?d like you to investigate. Ah, Mizoguchi Takehiro. Who is he? I don?t know! That?s why I?m asking you to investigate! Stop it, lemme go! Got anything? He has no records at all I see Does he has anything to do with the case? No. Alright, I?ll do more investigations Oh! Got it! He?s calling a taxi. ?Please take my daughter for her piano lessons like usual?. Piano? Can I chase after a car? This is troublesome. Be careful, ok? It?s alright, it?s alright Don?t talk like that OK! And another thing: never speak to strange men What about the taxi driver? Just tell him the destination I?m going!.. Please... We don?t have any customers Yeah My salary will still being paid, won?t it? Don?t talk like that. This is all we can do for now. I?m quietly thinking here. What are you thinking about? Is there a way we can get a lot of money in a jiffy. Ah, that?s just like me Nope, we?re not the same. I?m not worried about small salary, I?m thinking big money here. Welcome... What? Ah, it?s you. Go back! Just go back. I?m busy here. Wait! I was just kidding. Just kidding! Have a seat. Yuki-chan, get her some tea. What is it? Um? um? Nothing... Don?t you have something to tell me? No... Nothing It?s about Yukio. Something was strange at the club storeroom when we went to save him the other day. Was there? Really.. What is it? Who are you? Sleep with me? See you? I?d like to ask you something. If, and I mean IF, Yukio recovers his memory... ...and he remembers things from the past... ..what?s gonna happen to the present Yukio? Then things will change. Perhaps Yukio now and the past Yukio can merge and ?get along? without a problem. Or, the present Yukio with no memory of his past, when he recovers his memory... ...he?ll be back to the past Yukio and the present Yukio will vanish just like that. There?s a possibility of this happening also. The past Yukio and the present one ? they?re really different. There?ll be turmoil between the two. Maybe so... Poor... Poor Yukio... Yukio can vanish just like that? Excuse me... You?re Aikawa Natsumi-san aren?t you? You?re taking piano lessons? What time do you finish? I?m not a bad person, I?m doing this for your mother... Excuse me... My dad told me not to speak to strange men No, I mean, what time do you finish? Natsumi-chan.. The problem is, how do we deliver the kid into the hotel room? Lots of reporters are waiting around here. This will take guts from Yukio. - Good afternoon! - Good afternoon.. What are you doing here? You?re always greeting me with ?What?re you doing here?. We?re busy right now. We?ll talk next time. Sorry. What a pity. I have something interesting to tell you What is it? You?re busy, aren?t you? I?ll go. It?s alright! What?s the interesting thing you have to tell me? Chiaki... Chiaki? It seems, she knows something about Yukio and keeping it a secret. What? She is worried about it, but she still keeps it a secret. Don?t tell me this is just one of your intuitions again She said: "If Yukio gets his memory back, what?s gonna happen to the present Yukio?" While talking, she seemed to be lost in her thoughts and then she said, ?Poor Yukio?. She?s the innocent type, isn?t she? But she seemed serious and kept saying ?Poor Yukio?. I?m not sure what it is, but looking at her, I think she must know something. Hello... Ah, Yukio?.. Boss, it?s Yukio Hello, Yukio, what?s the matter? Ha? You need a woman? Yes. She said her dad told her not to speak to strange men. Yes... Yes. I can?t seem to get close to her. I understand. What time does the class finish? Yes.. Ok, I?ll send a woman over. Listen, can you go the piano class? Piano class? Someone?s asking us to deliver this 8 year old girl to her Won?t it be better for her to go? An older woman will be better Older..? Oy.. What?s with the get-up? I?m hiding my true self for the moment. Which one?s Aiso?s daughter? She hasn?t come out yet... Sorry to ask you this out of the blue... But have you remembered anything? Nope. Maybe I will never be able to recall everything Um.. it?s alright. No hurry. An idiot who can?t remember all and the one who doesn?t know anything, they may be similar, but not really the same. Not the same Yeah, not the same She?s coming out! The girl carrying the bag.. My clothes doesn?t seem to be suitable It?s suitable. Really suits you. Wait!.. Yukio! Great, I made it! You?re a cute girl. Sit quietly, OK?. Hello... Eh?! Where is Natsumi? Who are you? I?ll call you in 30 minutes. Please think it over ? how much you?re willing to pay. This is a new method of kidnapping. A mother makes her own decision.. ...on how much to pay to the kidnapper for her kid. It?s a good method, isn?t it? So, think about it. Great! Red light! We have to obey traffic rules, don?t we? What? This is bad, the oil?s leaking Oil?s leaking?! What are you doing? Let me go! Let me go! What the hell? It?s ok now. You still won?t speak to me? ... I see ... It?s great that you listen to your father. Great. I know you won?t speak to me, but please listen to what I have to say. The matter is... Your mother wants to see you. So she asked me to bring you over. I?m the delivery guy. So I hope you can follow me to your mother?s place. Can I say something? To trust you for that reason, that?s stupid, isn?t it? Stupid..? Hello? Quit the job. Something bad has happened. Natsumi?s been kidnapped. I already saved her What..? Already saved? I already told you, no matter what, I?ll deliver. Another thing, it?s difficult to get through to your daughter. I?m going to give her the phone. Please talk to her and tell her to trust me. Hello? I?m passing it to her It?s your mother Hello, mum? Hello, Natsumi? It?s really Natsumi? Thank goodness you?re safe! Did you worry about me? Of course..! It?s not just acting? I?ll be angry.. Sorry. But I?m ok. I see you on TV everyday... ...and not just in dramas, in other programs too. Thank you. Will you come and see me? OK. I can trust this guy? I?ll come over. I?ll be waiting for you. We?ll have dinner together. Ever since you went away to live with your dad, I haven?t had any appetite. I?ll be waiting for you. See you... Go home. My daughter?s coming. Eh?! Natsumi was driven away in a car? Yes. I haven?t called the police. I decided to tell you. Can?t be! It?s kidnapping. Kidnapping? And I know who?s the culprit. My mother? Hmm, what kind of person is she? I don?t know... You don?t know? Is she dead? Huh? Maybe the one who?s 'dead' is me. Eh? I have lost my memory... Do you understand? I understand. You?re a cool guy, but pitiful. Pitiful? Because you can?t remember anything from the past, can you? Yeah... But this is the first time someone say I?m pitiful. For adults, having lost my memory makes them envious. But things like what games you used to play... ...what you liked, you can?t remember any of them, right? Yeah... I don't... That?s why you?re pitiful. But some things are best forgotten. I want to remember everything. Living with my dad. Following you now to see my mum. I don?t want to forget any of these. Whatever I?ve seen, I?ll remember. Oh, they have a hard job... But there?s a possibility of this being aired on TV... Excuse me, which is the best stylish boutique in here? What? Don?t say ?what?? Is there a boutique where I can get something beautiful and suitable? Where?s the room of Aikawa Aiso? We can?t give out our clients? room numbers I?m Kurihara, her ex-husband. Tell me. Ex-husband is not considered related to her anymore. We can?t tell you. Alright, in that case, tell me which is the most expensive, beautiful suite room here? Yes, who is it? It?s me, Kurihara. Please give Natsumi back to me. Natsumi? Isn?t she with you? Stop pretending. After piano class today, she was snatched and driven away in a car. It?s your doing, isn?t it? I don?t know anything of this Open the door! Immediately! I don?t remember that I have to tell you anything What do we do now? What now? This is bad. I can?t get out of here! That?s because you wasted too much time. I heard you talking to someone in there! Open the door! Give Natsumi back to me! You know, I will get Natsumi back legally. I don?t care! You?re still pretending? OK! I?m going to report to the police now. If you still don?t know, Natsumi?s been kidnapped. Kidnapped? That?s bad! It?ll be bad if this gets on TV Kidnapped?! Eh?! How can it turn out like this? Payment for clothes? What are you talking about? Why do you need new clothes? Unnexpected things have happened. Listen, if Yukio was to come over to deliver the kid, he?ll get arrested. How can it be like this? The kid has agreed to come, that?s why he?s bringing her over But if I bring her there now, there are reporters and cameras all over.. She?ll be seen. That won?t be good. What are you doing here? Schoolwork Schoolwork? He?s my teacher... Teacher?.. Yes. Right now, we?re learning about ants. Let?s review everything back. In our Japan, the ants are all weak. In America, the ants can be as strong as Mohamad Ali. - It's great! - Hey, you can?t say that... Even in Japan, there are some strong ants. They?re called 'Haki'. The ants originally came from North Africa, then travel to South Africa, they are 200 types. Surprised, aren?t you? They are capable of building big anthills? He won?t follow us anymore, you don?t have to cycle so fast now. Your work is hard, isn?t it? Nope... Not at all. It?s the police... Police! Hello... Aikawa-san! Aikawa-san! Who is it? We?re from police. Sorry to bother you. I think you know why we are here. Mr. Kurihara wants us to find out if his daughter is here or not Can you let us in? Please. Whooah, such a luxurious room. Aikawa-san, you? It turns out the pro-wrestler Saiko-san was in Aiso?s room! Saiko-san, when did you start going out with her? What? The situation here?s chaotic. It?s really bad! Really?.. I understand. Let?s wait a while longer and see. Yes. What?s the matter? What is it? Tell me. It?s about your mother. There?s another person who likes her... ...and situation at the hotel has become chaotic now. Hey, I?m hungry. Let?s eat first. No! Why?.. Mum said she wants to eat dinner together with me. But it might take a while yet till we can get in I don?t mind. What do you mean? About being kidnapped I?ll tell them, I?m not being kidnapped. I follow you on my own free will to see my mum. Everything will be ok, won?t it? May be so.... But... You?ll also be on TV. And not only that. They?ll ask you how you feel about your mum?s boyfriend and other things. Even about the situation you?re in now. Some cruel person could even ask if you prefer your dad or your mum. It?s ok. Mum gets asked these all the time Even so... I?m used to it. I won?t be upset. I see... Let's go? It is really alright? As long as you can protect me. You will grow up a good woman Thank you. Let's go! I already asked for ransom! Let's go... Let's go... If I don?t have her with me, I won?t get the money..! LET HER GO!!! What's wrong?.. What's wrong with you? My heart. It hurts. It?s my heart.. Are you alright? Can you get up? Slowly.. slowly... that's fine. That's OK... You?re clever! He?ll be after us..! Hold on tightly.. Hello.. eh?! Now? Yes. We are here. She's fine. I?ll protect her as promised It?s a little girl! You?re Aikawa Natsumi, aren?t you? Where have you been? Natsumi-chan, we heard you?ve been kidnapped? Do you know everybody has been worried about you? I know. I wasn?t kidnapped. I?m here to see my mum. Who asked you to come over? The truth is you were forced to come, weren?t you? Natsumi-chan, what?s your blood type? Which subject are you really good at? What?s your favourite food? Natsumi! Natsumi! Mommy! Here you are! I?ve really missed you, Natsumi-chan. It hurts, mom... Please bear with it for the moment. This is the only way we can be together I know, but this is still embarrassing It?s part of growing up. Let?s cry. Show your emotions. It?s so touching. Finally, they can be together. I have to take pic of the recipient What? Can you take another? I blinked You should know better. Focus on the camera and smile when your pic is being taken. I understand. Please, once more Only because this is a special one. Nat-chan, I have something good. Look, your favourite strawberries. I get the feeling I?ll get to see you, so I prepared earlier. What?s the matter? You like strawberries, don?t you? Is it good? Do you like? Mum... I like not this type, but the ordinary strawberry. Ordinary? Ordinary, small ones, available in supermarkets Why? This one is the best and hard to get You still don?t get it. You can?t cut this type of strawberry into pieces. I really loved it back when I was in kindergarten, you cut the strawberries and added milk and sugar We were always together then. That was what I really liked - more than anything Aaah.. that one. You really like that? You haven?t changed. I can say you don?t understand my feelings, mom... ... but it?ll be better saying you don?t know strawberries. After dinner, I?ll be going home. I?ll live with dad. I?ll come and see you again. You?ll be kinder to me when we meet once in a while. Isn?t that true, delivery guy? I took one extra photo. I?ll give you the better one. It it ok? It's a gift. Mr Delivery... Thank you. Sugar and milk? I?ll try and see Mum, I?m giving you this. It?s been hard work. Who are you impersonating now? Impersonating? Nobody. ?Whatever I see... ...that I?ll always remember?. A little girl said that. When Mizoguchi Takehiro, the other 'me' resurfaces ... ... what will happen with present "me", Hayasaka Yukio? In my world right now, I?m the delivery guy. and there?s Naomi and Chiaki. Other than that, I?ve forgotten everything else. Yukio?s really late. What?s going on? What?s the matter? What are you doing here? I?m waiting for Yukio, of course Really? You?re still following my orders? Trying to get Yukio to remember his past? Of course. I need the money. I?m the hardworking type If you haven?t left out anything in your report, I don?t mind paying you. But you?ve forgotten to tell me something, haven?t you? Or, are you purposely hiding it from me? What a cute face? What is it. Tell me! I saw it... Just briefly. What did you see? It wasn?t Yukio. Wasn't Yukio at all. Because that Yukio was really scary. Who was that?? Amnesiac, are you there? I?ve got the info on Mizoguchi Takehiro. Call me back. I've found the truth and it will be expensive. Bye! Who is it? Mizoguchi? I don?t know, I?ve never heard of him. The voice in my head feels like it?s getting closer. Where will Hayasaka Yukio vanish to?
