That’s why I hit him Instead of filing defamation lawsuit It would be better to face police If it goes on like this After twenty years We will have to search Kannadigas Among other language people Why should our children learn Hindi, Tami Malayalam? There will be many successors of mine Someone else will raise voice for Kannada when I am gone We have law to handle such things The government is forming a committee Dear lawyer, you follow your way I will continue the agitation of my self respect Aarti Aarti Aarti You are always slow Okay?

We must travel to the nooks and corners of Karnataka And flame the fire of Kannada in each every person Who will support us in this? There are many people Along with poets, artists have expressed their support Recently Varanata Dr Rajkumar has written a letter expressing his support to Gokak movement He has also stated that whenever there is a threat to Kannada and its people he will fight till his last breath against it When Annavru stepped into the arena The arena is ours From where we are starting our journey? Shankar, what about DC’s permission? Hey get down First thing If you act as per law like a DC We will respond the same way Second thing We can’t improve a language But language excels us Our job is to protect it If we get provoked Do you think this is some UP or Bihar? Give respect and take respect here Last and final You can stop us being a DC You cant stop us as a person It will be an order if you grant It will be a war if we snatch it This is Kannada’s chariot Come join us As our land, our language and voice Lets march ahead as one for the language Demand justice shout that you are Karunada’s warrior O Kannadiga Learn and teach how ancient our language is Kannada language which taught us the word 'Mother' is our breath Let us mediate on it every moment We are indebted to mother and mother tongue Let may anyone stand against us Our decision will not change O Kannadiga Self esteem is our bloodline Kannada is our self respect Respect which we are enjoying by the language is the gift granted by Mother Bhuvaneshwari Yellow and red flag is the foundation to our Kannada Annavru is the leader to our movement People’s affection is our strength This victory will be historical O Kannadiga Geetanjali Dad I didn’t expect this from you Come here Do you the whereabouts of your neighbour?

Geetanjali where were you all these days? How are you? I tried so much... It is a long story Shankar The day you and my father fought On that night Dad took me to our native He boxed me in without letting me write a letter to you He tried a lot to get me married to someone else But I didn’t agree I told him I’ll not marry anyone else than Shankar He tried whatever he could Then he stopped I still long for you No one can separate Shankar and Geetanjali When you went away from me I was very much depressed The one who supported me during that time it was Aarti Shankar I want to see you happy forever Your friend was so happy That smile and celebration Wedding ambience feels superb This happiness will last only for two days Then the real character will surface Then we start doubting,if are they the same person whom we liked Why are you so pessimistic about marriage? Many people are successfully leading their married life Falling in love, getting married are not a big deal Keeping that love alive for years is a big deal When we are in love we like the person as they are When it comes to marriage You want the person to be the way you want After the marriage domination will start Even parents expect their children to look after them in old age That much of minor selfishness will be there I agree Prem wanting to change you was his selfishness You wanted to live the way you like was also your selfishness, right? If everybody thinks in the same way We couldn’t have survived Everything will be alright after marriage Don’t worry I told you everything will be alright Go answer the call Talk to him Hello Did you make up your mind? Regarding? About our marriage Change your decision Stop caring NGO’s kids You know about me If I’ve done anything wrong I’ll correct myself But I can’t give up on my dreams Prem Is this your final decision?

Many people won’t be having any idea Why they are getting married They say I am getting old I can manage for ten years They get married Few get married to have children Few get married because they are growing grey hair Few get married to fulfil their bed ridden granny’s wish Granny will survive But he will be dead Is your granny bed ridden or You want to get onto bed? You need not answer me Its enough if you know it Priya is a very good girl till you get married you can have friendship with anyone but can’t marry them Shouldn’t marry to please someone Due to that both lives will be ruined Marriage should become a holy knot Not a riddle I love you Akash Everyone is happy here Except me I am not happy with my own engagement Priya, you are my good friend But as a life partner? If we get married even after realising this Not only our married life even our friendship will be doomed You liked whatever I did when we were friends But not after becoming your fience If we get married even after realising this We both will become like them I’ll not commit the same mistake what my parents had committed Akash, what are you talking?
