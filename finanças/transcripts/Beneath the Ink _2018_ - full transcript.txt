The area here in Southeastern Ohio is what you want to call, like, Appalachia. If you're not familiar with the Appalachia region, we could pretty much sum it up by saying poor, uneducated people. Yeah, they're tearin' down factories, they're tearin' down houses. People are legit struggling. You see it every day. And socially speaking, when you're not helping society move forward you're bound and determined to see it crumble in front of you. My name is Billy White and I'm a tattoo artist in Zanesville Ohio. It's simple. I tell people all the time that like, I really feel like my community is 30 years behind. What about a Confederate butterfly tattoo? - Do you want me to give her...? - I don't know if I know what that is per se. - Jessica knows her. - I think she called in. I think it was a Facebook message. It's been overwhelming. I guess. It's been eye-opening, too... to find out, you know, that a lot of this stuff does exist and that it is, you know... I've even tattooed some of these guys and didn't know they had this kind of stuff on 'em. And then boom, here we are and we're covering it up. As long as I can remember, we're living in the most toxic time I've ever lived in. Society's belief systems are seemingly changing. We're reverting back into a time that I thought we had moved past. So I'm seeing this and I'm thinking to myself, like, "My God," you know, "This person died." People out there are willing to kill for their hate. I couldn't stand back anymore and think, like... ... as I often do... What can I do? We're drawing a cover-up today... making the design a little bit busy so we can hide the image in it. Laurette - have a seat up here. You can take both your shoes off if you want. Whatever's most comfortable for you. Put it up here for me. How long ago did you have this done? Um, it's probably been about 5 years. Was it done at a shop or...? Uh, yeah, but not by somebody that was licensee to shoot tattoos. Right. So I came in to get a swastika tattoo covered up on my foot. - All right, are we ready? - Yep. All right, here we go. I was in a bad relationship and the guy was a white supremist so he inspired it. And I got drunk enough on Wild Turkey that I decided to do it. He was abusive. It was definitely a mental thing as well, so... I just took on his beliefs, you know. And I mean I really did feel that way at some point in time but I mean don't now. I do interim daycare and both of the kids that I watch are biracial, so... It's embarrassing, you know. It is. Come on back, man. Because of my social media outreach, you know, a lot of people, once I say "share," it spreads like wildfire. Have you come around here for me on this side of the table. We'll get the stencil on you, my man. And we'll go from there. And it happens. You see it, both sides. You see people that are super stoked for the person, and they're really happy that the person's moving on. And then you have the people that are like, "Well, would they have done it if it wasn't for free?" kinda thing. I don't care that it's for free. Or I don't care why they got it. I just feel like I have to do something. [John] Right now I live in Thornville, Ohio. Originally from Newark, Ohio. Spent 15 years down in Malta, Ohio. I was born and raised here in Circleville, Ohio. [chuckles] My dad was an alcoholic, my mom was an alcoholic. Growing up, that's all Mom and Dad did, was drink. Dad was very racist. My rest of my family, my uncles and stuff, was very racist and negative toward everybody. And then when I was 16 years old, Dad went over the edge, committed suicide. At that point in time in my life, I absolutely hated everyone. I didn't care who it was white, black, I hated everybody. I ended up going down a path that most people never go down. And it took a really big change to pull me out of that. What's going on, man? Let me see your back. I want to get a tracing of it real quick... see what we're working with. You know, still to this day, I'll sit back and think what the hell was I thinking? I was like that all the way up until I was about 27 years old. Couple years later, me and the ex-wife was talking about adopting and ended up adopting a little boy out of Florida. That's my son. I don't want my son to know that his dad participated in that. My son now is 12 years old and one of the greatest kids you'll ever meet. I mean, he's loving... boy loves me to death, love him to death. A life of hate is just not what you want. You just don't want to live life like that. Big eagle sittin' on a branch, some clouds over top of that. - Works for me. - That'll do 'er. [music] [John] People get like that because they don't understand or want to understand. Or they're afraid to try to understand. I think I found myself now and I'm happy with who I am and the way my life and the path of my life has taken. All right, man. I'm going to start mixing up some colors I need to mix up right quick like. It's how I know tattoos are so powerful 'cause I mean, I'm sitting here and I'm getting all these tattoos lasered off my face. You know, I'm taking them off my face because I don't like the way it makes people perceive me. It's not because they don't mean anything to me. They actually mean more to me... [choking up, exhaling] They... They mean a lot to me 'cause I got them all for, like, my parents when they passed away. And, um... I'm on the cusp of my mom's birthday... ... makes me all emotional and shit. So, uh, I lost my parents 49 hours apart, 7 years ago in April. [music] You know they're not here, but that doesn't mean I can't make them proud. I want to make them proud, I want to make my kids proud. So when I'm gone they're not like, yeah, my dad was just a guy. He just did tattoos, you know. Maybe he did something. [music fades] Couple on there for you, John. - Yeah, I appreciate it, man. - Take a look - what you think, man? Definitely gives a new start to things, man. It really does. I'm going to keep doing these things. I'm going to keep covering up this stuff, forever as far as I'm concerned. - Glad I could do it for you. - Definitely makes me feel better, and it's definitely a great thing, man. - All right. - True. No shit... now you'll definitely feel it. Set it in. It's... I mean, it's really changed my life, dude. Good, man. So I think that's what we plan on doing. All righty. Thank you so much, man - you're awesome. You're welcome. I really appreciate that. I'm just going to keep trying to... you know, day by day, make the world just maybe a little bit better of a place... ... if it's possible. [music] subtitles: Iladi Elladi
