Among so many different jobs, teachers, as me, hear the bell ring more than other people do. Whenever I hear the bell ringing, I will... Oh, it's time to class. Can't you find another job? What? Many university graduates can't find ideal jobs, so they become teachers. Principal, in fact, my wish is to become a teacher. Mr. lam, this is a high standard college. So, we have had severe consideration in choosing teacher. Yes. I hope every teachers teaches at least three subjects, and takes care of one extracurricular activity. Yes. Except biology, what else can you teach? Science. And maths... If it's necessary, I can teach english too. It's not necessary, I'm teaching english. Yeah... we don't want copy books... Right? Drinking something? Coffee or tea? Lam siu-fung, not yet finished? What do you want to be in future? Teacher. Why? I can learn many things, teach many people, & have many holidays. Good morning class. Good morning class. Good morning class. Time flies, I've taught in this college for three years. Whenever I pass here, I have the same feeling. Boring. Let me introduce... This is Mr. yip, Superman in property field. Mr. chow, he is teaching arts, father of arts of hk behaviour. Mr. ngai attacks from the left to the right. And Mr. kuk attacks from the right to the left. You are too cunning, this is noodle, the most popular teacher in these days. Noodle. Mr. ting. The opposite is miss chan, the music teacher. Good morning, Mr. wong. Good morning. Except miss chan, there is another lady teacher, miss Kong. What does that mean? You just forget my homework. Come here. Come here. Don't you feel shame? I feel shame instead. Half year! You didn't hand in your homework punctually. You trash! Get lost. Go back to Mr. lam's place for punishment. It's ill-fated to have such kind of son. That's right, this is the teachers' room of our college. I've almost forgotten to introduce Mr. wong, the one who sits next to me, this is my best friend, Mr. wong. He doesn't feel well today. He always feels sick, the reason is simple... What's the matter? What's up? What's up? Something is inside. Something is inside? What's that? What are you looking for? Whistle. I see. Have you searched every inch? Did you put inside? I don't think it works. It's useless. Why not break it with an electric drill? Did you offend anyone? Maybe someone wants to trick you. Yeah, but don't let us be involved. Do you want the police? The teachers haven't come, I don't wish them to come either. You have to pay for it if you break something. Mr. chow, you ruined a book shelf some time ago. - How much did you pay? - Right. I paid the price of the book shelf. That's not you. The one who did it died long time ago. He sat here too. Right. - He taught geography. - Named cheung. We paid condolence money too. - That's right. - Poor him! I think, this room may be haunted. Sir, the bell rings! Stop messing up. What soup will you make tonight? Chicken legs. Is that good? Goodbye sir. Not here. One two... It's soundless, will there be any accident happened? Damn you! Bastard! Pay attention, I've got it. It's useless to attract attention by only one board. We should make one more board. Forget it, just let it be. By the way, I have to do the check-up, I am leaving. I leave these to you. Alright. Why didn't you mention it this morning? Bye bye. Bye bye. Your pager rings again. Shit! I've forgotten one thing. What? Mr. wong paged me, I've forgotten to buy vegetables. Vegetable? Yeah. But we haven't voted yet. If the market is closed, it'd be shit. Don't you want it? Why do you leave it here? Buy one pack of dried bean curd skin get free juice. When your wife was alive... She bough many. Really? Is that your question? No. I asked whether she came here with you or not. This is nice. Yeah! Is that right? This is much more worse than that. Try this. It's nice. Choose it yourself, anyway, that's for your home. One is missing. Unlimited times for lucky draw! Lucky draw tickets. Why isn't anybody around? Use your little finger, hurry up. Little finger, little finger. Haven't you got finger nail? No. Me too. Theft? Freeze! How dare you steal? Kid, where do you study? See whether he is our student. I think so! The uniform looks like the one of our school. Are you kidding me? Poor me! We have to beg the mercy from the manager and call his family. I wish I were the thief. Poor! I think we can't leave before 7, I have no time to cook. We have nothing to eat tonight. Which school? Tell me! Abc college. The music scared me. Luckily he isn't our student. What do you want? I want some water, excuse me. Water? Is outside crowded? Outside? Yes, it's crowded. It's spacious! It's crowded. How many times have I told you? When I cook, never come in. What do you want? Go out please. Don't you want to eat? What are you looking at? Why do you look at me? Why the books are put upside down? Kidding? Isn't it haunted? I'm back. So, what's the first thing you have to do? Bathing. Don't scratch that, go and take a bath. Alright. Dinner will be done soon. I saw you cleaning apple cucumber. Yes. That's right. Why can't I find any here? That's for tomorrow. How about these? Can't you recognise that? We ate that last night. Heat it, then it's ready for eating. Tasty. Dor, what have you learnt in school? Eating without talking about school. See, we have no appetite. Do you have correction pen? No. Any progressive report? One year ago, we planned to rebuild the outdoor playground... To an interior playground. The budget is 9.5 million. Until now, we have got a donation of $2,402. It's close to our target. What's the agenda of today's meeting? We have to discuss the price of the student's notebooks. Should we raise it from $2 to $2.1 or $2.2? How about $2.27? Ten cents can't catch up the inflation rate. 20 cents are too much, we can charge $2.1 if they buy 10 or more. If they buy only one, we charge $2.2. Principal, why not take the medium price? That is $2.15. We don't have 50 cents for change. Alright, let's vote for it. If you agree the new price be $2.2, say "agree". Agree. If you object, say "object". Object. I think more people agree, so, we would raise the price to $2.2. Who has suggestions about teaching or about administration? Please raise it and discuss it. About the extracurricular activities, anything we have to talk? Last time, we discussed that... Is it necessary to stop some activities which the students dislike? Say, astronomy club. I don't think they have many participants. No. Actually no participant. No student joined the club. I agree with Mr. kuk. But, may I say... Of course not. Alright, who agree the cancellation of astronomy club, say agree. Agree. Object, say "object". Only one objection. I have to give birth... It's all wet. Not big enough... much more is coming out. Mr. lam, you are a biology teacher. Come on. Please help her delivery. She has to deliver now. Bring me a cutter... Up there. Hurry up. Lie down. Run, run! Run faster... Run... Let's start practice. If you know swimming, swim two rounds. If you don't, practise right here. Ok? Swim slowly. Why don't you take the lesson? No swimming suit? Don't you like swimming? Truant? What's the matter? Mine... come. What? I am on my rag. Well, I won't bother you. Take your time. Haven't you eaten yet? Yes, Mr. lam. Mr. chuen, what is that? Ribs on rice. So many ribs! Come on! That's why the students fainted after eating your food. Difficult business, you know? How about that? Fried rice. It seems that someone has taken half of it. Be considerate. Mr. chuen, you are getting more and more perfunctory. I think nothing is good, except your tea. Your tea is really great, can you give me two glasses? You just want free tea? Alright, take it. Your tea is really nice. Really nice. - Take it... - It's really nice. Anyway, you won't buy anything. Do you know miss Kong has a baby boy or a baby girl? Mr. wong. What does this mean? Why didn't you say please? Please. This is... Which one? Show me. This one. It's time to eat, not time to ask, ask in the class. After asking question, why should you say? Goodbye sir. You look nice. What's wrong with you? Nothing. The water is getting worse and worse. Where is it from? The escalator, when you look up, you look the same. How is it? Everyone is the same. I watched you watching. I didn't. I've found the cartoon sticker for ages. Mr. wong, Mr. lam... - What a coincidence! - Mr. law. - Long time no see. - Yeah! How are you? Fine! How about you? Are you still a teacher? Nothing different. I didn't teach. You didn't? Still, I make a living by leading a small team. What a hard job. My office is just nearby, come and take a seat. Come on. No, I have to buy some stickers. Let's go, I'll go with you. No, Mr. wong said it's sold downstairs. Come on... Mr. wong, Mr. lam, tonight is the "students' night". It fits your mood most. They are all college girls. Young, and beautiful. Don't be shy, come on, enjoy yourself. Why not give them physical punishment? Hit their asses, anything you like. Mr. law, I want to go home. Why? I have to correct students' homework. I want to finish them as soon as possible. Let them help you! They are used to work. Come on, don't leave, isn't it a place for fun? Yes, it is. I'll treat you to drinks. Help me to teach that two naughty girls a good lesson. Enjoy yourself, hurry up! Enjoy yourself. Now, I want to inspect the other classrooms, enjoy yourselves. Sir, my name is siu-qgio. I am a form 4 student in chun-Kong college. My name is liu-shui, I am a f.5 student in sang-fat college. Sir, what's your name? Tell me please, come on. Let's have physical education. Why not few games in bed... I mean badminton. Come on, say something! Come on! The principal will blame me! Please teach me something. Maybe, you can do something. So? How about touching me? You go ahead. I am going to toilet. Let me go with you. No... Forget about him. What's this? No, don't touch. Don't stop me. It's for carrying books. I want to see what's inside. Nothing... Come on. What's the matter, granny? You'll get tired later, so I do the massage for you first. Thank you. Turn on the light, sit properly. Ask them to come out at once. What's the matter? Sudden inspection, the cops come frequently. Yes sir. What are you? People call me "sir". Police? No, I am a teacher. What's up? He is a teacher. So you come to the "students' night". You are a teacher. Do you know what shame is? You look decent! Have you ever thought of taking schoolgirls' advantages? What are you? I want to piss. I want to know your occupation. I serve in this toilet. Why are there two men serving such a small toilet? Sir, wash your hand please. No. How about drying your hand? I didn't wash my hand. Come on, comb your hair. No... It's alright... Tips, sir. Alright, I want to change some coins for feeding the meter. Please help yourself. Three more. Anymore? What's this? This is for drawing... For you to draw the area of the corpse... Sir, where are you going? Madam. It's shit! This time, I am in deep shit! You can't help me. They didn't take the picture and didn't say which school. It's of no fun! If their names are disclosed, they would lose their jobs. I think this guy looks like Mr. wong. Mind your words, it'll harm other's reputation. What proof do you have? Look carefully, this guy really looks like Mr. wong. I think so. Read carefully. Mr. wong, have you read the paper today? I read yesterday. How about last night? Last night? We went to Macau. We went there last night. Are you alright? Are you alright? It's fine. I've said, it really works! The fishes stop all the evil things. Some died! Time to eat, don't sleep. Why do you raise so many electronic pets? They are not mine, my students' pets. I don't want to watch them dying. So I just help them to raise it. This is nice! This is collected from chan yik-kin of f 3b. He wore a golden watch in class, so I took it from him. It's a trouble! I have to ask his parents to get it back later. What's wrong? In a man's life, at least he should possess a golden watch - a benz, right? - And... You've told me many times. But I've got any. Dear teachers, this is miss Lee, she is going to substitute miss Kong. Hi, I just came back from the states, and this is my first time teaching. Please give me a hand. Hello, my name is yip, I teach economics. My name is kuk, I teach Chinese history. My name is ngai, I teach maths. My name is chow. I am a teacher. Alright, it's time to work. Who is free in this section? Mr. lam, please show miss Lee around. Principal... I am free too. I think I have much more time than Mr. lam... Just go to work. Why do you fight for that? I don't think you have chance. It's your turn! It's your time to teach! Mr. lam, where are you taking me to? The principal asked me to show you around. How many years have you taught here? Three years, how about you? I am new. Yeah. You have strong American tongue. Really? Say once again, "I', "I'm new" I am new. Which state are you from? L.A. What did you teach in la? I study in la. What did you teach? I teach... That is Mr. chan, he teaches physical education. Let's go there for a walk. What's that place? That's the other part of the school. Which part? Miss Lee, let me show you this way. We just came up from that playground. Do you recognise that? Fresh air, convenient traffic, next to train station. We have swimming pool, basketball field, volleyball field... Interior gym room, everything. It's a nice place for investment. I am sorry. Never mind. The corridor is a bit narrow. Why don't you go first? Fine. If supply is bigger than demand... Then the damand may not be bigger than supply. Mr. lam, why do you walk so slowly? Nothing. Let me show you another place. Fine. Are you tired? Thirsty? Just a little bit. Why not drink something? It's great. Thank you. The water is a bit warm, since the tubes are heated by sunshine. Tasty? Yes. How about one more glass? This is our hall. Whenever I come in, I have a special feeling. Want some chocolate? I loved eating chocolate in class when I was small. It's not allowed to eat chocolate in class, we're not that open. So, eat it secretly. No, we have strict school regulations. Our discipline teams are divided into abcd... This way. Alright. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. - Let's eat. - Let's eat. Where did you take her to? We just walk around. And then? Then... Then? I see. Shit! She is staring at me! Oh no! Why not have lunch together? I can go now. Me too. It's alright. Sweat and sour pork... These male teachers seldom eat here. Why they have all come today? Miss Lee, what do you love eating? Anything. What should we order? Why don't you order for us? I eat anything. Mr. kuk, why don't you order for us? Anything will do, you just go ahead. Anything will do, Mr. wong, why don't you make the order? Well... How about fried beef with vegetable? Good! But I don't eat beef. So, you make the order? Try the goose intestine in pepper sauce? Sorry, I don't like pepper sauce. Why not the "minute steak in Chinese style"? No, I can't eat beef. How about ribs in pepper sauce? I love ribs, but I can't eat pepper sauce. Well, no pepper sauce, no beef. Mr, lam, why don't you take the order? Go ahead. How about "beef in pepper sauce"? He doesn't like beef, and he doesn't like pepper sauce. I suggest... How about chicken? Good idea. Let's vote for it, those agree with chicken, say agree. Agree. Those like vegetable, say agree. Agree. Do you want something to drink? Agree. Are you arranging a strike? Agree. You are not a fastidious person. Unlike some people, they are choosy. They cook nice dishes here. No special order here. Only set lunch. It's nice too. What do you want? You make your own order. Just chicken on rice is left. Order one please, it's alright! Fine. Let's eat. Let's eat. Drink! Drink. Do you like the food? It's great. You seldom eat here. What make you ask such question? I have just seen you eating your own lunch box. Well, we... We try to keep the teaching atmosphere. So, we eat there to keep our teaching mood. Miss Lee, do you play tennis? Let's book a court to play a game, ok? Let her eat please. Talking after eating, will you? It's lunch time. Miss Lee, do you like sports? Mr. lam, this is my treat. I love swimming in the morning. Really? Yes. What a coincidence! You swim too. Yes, you too? Me too. Why aren't you in swimming suit? I... I need more warm-ups. Lady first... You walk that fast! But you swim faster. Why don't you swim? First, I'd like to study your swimming gesture. Miss Lee, good morning. Good morning. Mr. lam, you're punctual. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. The food is nice here. A candle will be placed here at night, it's really romantic. But don't come on Sunday, it's noisy. It's not convenient for us to talk. If you have questions about your studies, you'd ask in school. It's not necessary to talk right here, right? I am happy today, I want to order many food. Aren't you happy? No... nothing. What do you want to eat? I've made up my mind. May, actually I don't like soy milk. What did you say? They don't sell soy milk here. May... Try the lobster soup. It... it seems to be tasty. Why not an onion soup... Mister, may I take your order? I have no appetite, I don't want anything. No, I don't want anything. Have you thought of changing your job? What kind of job can I choose? I've been teaching for years. Tell me, what job can I do? What can I help you? I would like to see the principal. Mr. shi, you look much more different from what I see on screen. You look very smart. Really? How do you think my look? - Good. - Very good looking! Mr. lam. Do you have... Blue shirt, orange tie, and yellow trousers, so and so? How about these, Mr. shi? It's out-dated. Well, do you have 500 students... Or 1000, whom you can make them join our tutorial lesson? So, I can make you be the king of tutors. Well... no! What do you have? I have sincerity. Come on, "to sir with love"?! It's despicable. We sell idols here. Well, now I am going to teach, come and take a reference. If you copy 30% from me, I will hire you. Fine... Mr. shi, you look pretty. Pretty? Well, Mr. lam, are you ready? I'm ready. What do you think? You're great. How great? Very great. 9a 9a Yes! Very good. Many TV programmes, newspaper and magazines interviewed me, they want me to introduce a good tutorial school for them. I said, "it's hard to choose". Some tutorial schools play many tricks. Say the one... I've forgotten. They claimed themselves the best. It's no use. And there is a very big one, not in name but in area, 7,000 ft. It's immediately closed by the police. How can you choose from these shit. You know what is shit? How to choose from shit? Remember, don't just rely on tips. You'd pay attention to record. What is record? My tips is my record. The last hkscc, 80% of my tips worked. You can check the record, no doubt. 9a 9a I am a low-profiled person. All of you know that. My tips are accurate, no other tutorial school can achieve this. Well, my lesson ends here. I believe that, you've got more than you paid. The coming time, I'll leave it to the rising star... Mr. lam, he will give you lesson. Everybody, 9a! 9a Yeah! Good morning, everybody. I am sorry. I think, all of you are cute and smart, how is the air-condition? Cool enough? My name is lam, you may call me Mr. lam. After this lesson, I hope you would... Feel easy, happy, and generous! All are happy. Wear the mic, how can I hear you? Testing, one two... Many reporters from magazines and TV interviewed me, they asked how to provide... revision... In fact, I think it's important to let them study... So what? Everybody... I have nine hundred dollars here. I'll ask question, if anyone answers correctly, I'll give him the money as present, what do you think? Bravo! Nine hundred! Mr. lam, you can't do like this. You are going against our professional discipline. But the students like it. No way, you can't do it like this. Go downstairs and take a cup of coffee, cool yourself down. - Alright. - You'd think over it. Well I... It's ok. - I would like to take mon... - I'll keep it for you. As soon as possible... Thank you, Mr. shi. Bye bye. Nine hundred is no big deal, it's not enough to buy a school bag. Nine hundred more, say a double, what do you think? Great! What's the next item? Last time, we discuss whether we'd cancel the astronomy club. No students join this club. That's right, I think we'd better cancel it. Principal, I would like to try more weeks. It won't change anything. That's right, no one will come. That's right, this club has been organized for three years! Principal. I am substituting miss Kong, I have to take part in her extracurricular, too. I hope you to give me a chance to help the promotion. So I can help Mr. ting to attract more students. In fact, it's good to watch stars and know the universe. Well, it's good if we have promotion. Let's vote for it. Those who agree with the cancellation, say "agree". Agree. Those object, say "object". Object. I think I heard more object voice. Let's give it 3 more months to see whether there is any improvement. Thank you, principal. Let's go on the meeting. About teaching, what would you suggest? Principal, we are using blackboard. But the chalk isn't good to the health of students and teachers. I suggest using white board. And, the light is yellow in all classrooms. For long term studying, it'll affect the eye-sights of the students. I suggest to change it to white. Principal, many students have poor studying environment. I suggest to lengthen the opening hours of the library. Those students in need may have their revision there. I've collected a golden watch from a student some days ago. In these nights, I've a severe struggle. May I have a bold suggestion, hope you'd accept, shall we work out a regulation... Stating that the students shouldn't wear precious things to school? Principal, may I have a suggestion too? Please go ahead. I suggest a parents' day. So the teachers and parents can communicate. There will be a parents' day at the end of the semester. We discuss the students' problem at the end of the semester... Will it be too late? It's late... Welcome, please sign your name here. There is something to drink. Welcome... Please help yourself... Mr. lai, are you siu-ming's father? Yes. His academic result is getting worse and worse. And he is more and more hypocritical. Why don't you beat him up? Let's work out how to make him... Just beat him up. Sir, is there anything wrong with my son? No, nothing important. So, why do you ask me here? This is the parents' day, we would like to communicate with you. Communicate? I am so busy! I have to work. I understand... Sir, why my son always fails in english test? Please pay more attention to him. Mr. lai, physical punishment isn't a good way. You know, he always takes away my toys. Why don't you beat him? You fought with him because of the toys? Mr. Eve, for language, other than learning in class, usual practice is important too, why don't you revise it with him? I don't know english, how can I help? Why do you ask the parents here? Right, I am sorry... Are you alright, sir? Let me undress and show you. It's alright... Remember to beat him. - Ok... - Beat him. Sorry... My watch is lost. Lost? Yeah. So, buy another one. No, the father of the student is waiting for me up there. The watch you collected last time? Yes, the one I've showed you, it's lost now. Have you checked? Check one more time. No, I've searched every inch, I can't find it. What'll we do? Sir, where is my watch? I've asked my colleagues to take it back to you. If you don't give it back, I'll call the police. Mr. yip, I can tell fortune from your face. What's that hair? Hair for money? This one? This is great. This is dragon's hair. I have this, so I have this. How about this one? This is great! This is the hair for food. - Hair for food? - Yes. You have four! Right, breakfast, lunch, dinner and midnight snack. You have luck. Of course. Where did you do your hair cut? Sir, where is the golden watch? Make it cheaper. It's rather cheap. Come on, give me a discount. It's small business, I don't make big profit. It's a bit light! Do you have a weight? It's 100% gold. Kidding? I know what it is just by touching it. - It's real and it's cheap. - Why don't you give me discount. It's ok, I'll buy it somewhere else. You'll come back later. Where were I up to? You talked about 10 years ago... Right, ten years ago, I was a poor guy. I had no money to take the tram. God is merciful to me. So, I gained money and fame. See, how smart I am! I think it's wise of me to follow you. That's perfect, with my guts, and your wisdom... We can gain the whole Hong Kong. Where is my watch. Pal, only you have got the watch I want. I've told you! Take it to me... I told you many things. I told you when I was born. When I got married, and when I became father. Why didn't you return my watch? Mr. yip, we are men. Your... Right, this is great! Here is your watch. Telephone... Fine. Where were we up to? Isn't it the one you want? Right. What's your name? Forget it, you're in a hurry, time is money, Mr. yip. Money first, thank you. - Thank you. - Bye bye. Thank you... - Why did you say so much? - How much is it? Thirty thousand and something, I've walked over ten shops for it. And I've got 50% discount. Thank you so much. You'd pay my money back. No problem... Cut the crap, it's time for me to go now, pal. It's right here. It's late, I am leaving now. Go to work. Thank you, Mr. wong. Mr. lam, I've met all the parents for you. Thank you. You're welcome. Among your students, I think lai yiu-fai has important problem. In this minute, I think of many things. But I don't know who is lai yiu-fai. It's youl! Who is lai yiu-fai? Mr. lam... Fai, how is it? He is short-sighted. So he can't read the words written on blackboard clearly. He dares not tell his father. Cause his father's lost his job for months. What can we do? Let's get a pair of spectacles for him, what do you think? It's the right thing we'd do, a teacher'd care about his students. Let's go together. Alright, let's go. Sit properly, don't move. Can you read this line? This way. How about this? This way. Up. Where is this? That way. How about this? I can't read this clearly. Not clear. It's rare to see teachers like you. You care about your students so much! It's lucky to be your students. Sure I have to do it. The head-master of my son is really bad. He can't even remember my son's name. Poor teacher! Your spectacles seems to be out-dated. How can you see that? Let me check your eyes. That are two different subjects. Come and check it. Don't be nervous, relax. Alright, I will check it. Give me a discount. - Alright... - Teacher's benefit. It's your turn. Fai. How is the checking? It's good. Of high technique? - Remove your glasses. - How many degrees? I don't know. Don't know? Can you see clearly? Close. How about this one? - Isn't this nice? - Very good. The right eye first. No, I want to see longer time, thank you. How about the right eye? Can you make it? Yes. How about left eye? How long have you stayed in this business? I've been working for about twenty years. Wow! Mister, look forward, look this way. No, it turns itself. Right, it's alright. Look forward, see the words clearly? I think the previous one is better. This is better, right? I can't see things I've just seen. Look forward, it's eye checking. Can you see clearly? No. No? What a trouble! So, you can read the blackboard after putting on your glasses. This is a busy street, what is this? The garden street. Garden street. Yeah. You're short-sighted, how can you see the name-plate of the street? I can. This is a shopping spot. Let's have a walk. Alright. Fai, what should a student do after school? Go home. So, why are you standing here? Mr. lam, miss Lee, bye bye. It's alright... Miss Lee, have you visited this garden street? No. Let me take you for a walk. Fine. What's up? It's fai, I think I've seen him. This department store is divided into two stories. This is for general goods, the upper, same. It's rather cheap. This fits you very much. Yeah. It's dangerous! I know this word. What? Luck. How about these? Panty-hose. Excuse me? So big! It's cheap, buy one get one fess. Buy one get one free. Miss Lee, let's go to see the clothes. This is table cloth. This is broken. So why do you buy it? Why did you buy so many people's letters? No, I just want the stamps. Cheung yi-mui, she lives in mongkok. The prize she's got is this, a robot plus a memorial name plate. Repluse bay. Bravo! Miss Lee, draw one please. Alright. The audiences are wise not to use your phone. Maybe, your letter may be drawn. The lucky guy is... Candice ng she joined this game many times. She lives in ching yee garden, nt. What prize has she got? This one, a chocolate bottle. I didn't see you buying it. I stole it. Theft? Just a joke! The boss gave me a special discount. I really love this bottle. Why? When I was small, I really want to buy it. But when I returned, it's sold. I think I am lucky to be with you. What's this? Cop's gun bag. Wear like this? Yes... Stand up. This is difficult to wear. Try. Press down. You seem to know it well. And the back, there is another one on the back. On the back? There is another one on the back? Can you make it? No! It's difficult! It's difficult to make it together. Yup, it's difficult to be together. It's really difficult to put together. I can't make it. Mister, have you seen my hat? Hat? No. That's shit! Mr. ting, can I keep this costume after the promotion? No problem, just donate few thousands to the club. The students sure will like this kind of promotion. Yeah... The students love reading signs. Yes. Mr. ting, mr, lam, how do you think? You look pretty! Really? You have to hold a symbol for your sign. Like this? Mr. ting, the trousers are tight. Never mind, just hold it for few minutes. Why do you make it so tight? The students are coming, let's do it! The students will like it. Join the astronomy club. You won't regret. Join the astronomy club. You won't regret. - No way. - Mr. ting. The stars are really pretty. Count the stars, it's bright and pretty. We are gemini, the twins. Why not read the signs? Join the astronomy club, you won't regret. Miss Lee, plan a is really good. Really? Yes... At least the students know our club. And I've discovered that the students have great reaction. Yeah... Mr. ting, let's carry out plan b. Plan b? Mr. lam. Revising? Yes. Sit straight. Young man. What's up? Am I good looking? - Yes. - Really? How good? You look really good. Really good? That's right. How about joining the astronomy club? No. Why not? I can't. The one who is holding a basketball, you've dropped something. Mr. ting, this isn't mine. Really? Let me see. There is a tea gathering about stars and myths on Friday. Well, tea and cake provided. Why don't you come and join it? I do want to join it. - So? - Alright... Take care, not to drop your belongings next time. You've dropped something. A tea gathering about stars and myths. Woo, this is a great party! Friday, remember to go. You've dropped something! This Friday, there is a tea gathering at the hall. Join the astronomy club. There will be a tea gathering about stars and myths. Join the astronomy club. Join the astronomy club. Miss Lee, the students seem to like our plan. I think so. Why not... Celebrate it? Right, let's come to my home. Have dinner with us, ok? Oki well, you'd better buy some food for us. Let's go. Alright. Where to buy food? To the pharmacy. Here. - One two three. - You're great. Hit his plane! Take it back. - Thank you. - Take it back. 123456 sorry. Serve you right. Sorry! I am really sorry. He is so ill-fated! You should stop now. It's the right time... To cook! Let's go on... Let's help Mr. lam to cook. No! Never. He loves cooking alone, don't bother him. He never behaves like that, he is so happy cause you've come. Come on, here comes the food. Let me introduce you the food. This one, fried with garlic, see that? It's not canned garlic. He minced that. So it's more tasty. Come on! Want some chicken? This is different from normal chicken. This is African chicken, it's tasty. - African chicken. - Good boy. Take more... Eat more. This is... He always eats much. By the way, you two look alike. Are you kidding? When dor was small, he exactly looked like you. Dor, come on, tell her a joke. A man was watching something, a dog bit him to death. Isn't it funny? Dor is too full! Have you been sitting here for a long time? Finished! Do the cleaning... Let me help you. No! Never! He loves washing dishes alone. - No... - Let me do it. It's alright, I'll help him to tidy up. What you cooked today isn't as tasty as you did yesterday. Maybe, I have to cook food for one more person. That's why I didn't cook well. Dor, do you like that lady be your mom? My teacher always wants to meet my parents. But daddy is always busy. Daddy has his own reasons! Dor... Go to sleep. Don't bother uncle lam to wash his dishes. Go. The rat went into the hole to look for its mom. But it couldn't find her, it was scared. So it cried for help... Go on, go on... I haven't heard of this part, go on... That was its mom! It jumped happily. He falls asleep. Miss Lee, after hearing your story, I am really touched. This story is really touching. I think that I am like the little white rat in the story. And you are the stupid big cat. Dor is that hole. I think the story can't end like this. It should be continued, it'd be perfect. Three of us are... Three in one! What do you think about dor? I think dor... He is smart and lovely. His skin is white, active, and always makes you happy. What do you think about me? Mr. wong, I don't know whether I am too sensitive or not. Maybe, I've mistaken. You are so straight forward, that's why... I think I'd better tell you frankly. I think if you find a person who is about your age... I think that person will fit you more. I think you've mistaken. Since you came back from states, I think you know many philippine maids. I would like you to introduce me one to take care of dor. Alright, I'll look one for you. Thank you. It's late, I want to leave now. Sorry, I won't see you to the door. Bye bye. See you. Mr. lam, there is a call from the supermarket, you won the 1st prize. How many do I get? What I get will be yours too, right? Congratulations... Refrigerator, condoms and TV sets are most important. For the rest, take it or leave it, just up to you. Then I turn right, is that right? Remember, you have one minute only. Remember to get the TV set. Sure... And hifi, the most expensive one. I'll try my best... Discman, that's most important. Discman, alright... - Abalone. - I see. Canned is ok. And, wine! The most expensive one. What kind of wine? The most expensive one, fra... Red wine from France. Get some candies for me. A dozen, alright. Just anything, no, I don't want anything. No? Well... Start... Run, run, take from the top shelf... Wine, TV, move the TV set... Hifi, move it, hurry up. Mr. lam has a beautiful start. But, can he get what he wants? Let's wait and see. Mr. lam is approaching a very important target. He runs that fast, beware of falling! No remote control. Stay calm, you can't get the red labelled goods. Take it first. Take the green labelled goods, hurry up. Take it please, thank you. TV... Why didn't you take it? TV! Stop looking, give me a hand. Air conditioner... We can tell Mr. lam is an indecisive man from his eyes. Ladies, have my advice, never marry such kind of person. Mr. lam... He seems to be a fool. Just 20 seconds are left. This kind of person is useless! Game over. To hell with you! Time's running short, boy, just admit your failure. If you got a TV set, it'd be great. I can't get the TV. Give it to her. You do it. You are no match for me, but now, I quit. Take it. Look at her, she doesn't fit me. This kind of girl fits you more. I mean it. Dor's teacher wants to meet me. What time is it now? Time's up. Miss, I am dor wong's daddy, I'm invited by miss ng. Miss ng is not around, would you please wait for a minute? Well... May I know where the toilet is? The toilet is right inside. Thank you. Hi! You... you take dor to piss? Yes. You should do it yourself, how can you bother miss ng? Can he make it? Yes, he does it himself at home. Really? Miss ng, is dor naughty? That's why you want to meet me. He isn't naughty, but he is too much depending. He wants teacher to feed him. He wants others to go to toilet with him. I don't know whether he does the same at home or not. No, he does everything himself. Sometimes, he cooks for me. Really? Yes. And he always greets me mom in school. I don't know... Doesn't your wife take care of him at home? My wife passed away for years. I am sorry. Never mind. Maybe I should spend more time with him. Maybe you should ask somebody to keep him company. Maybe, re-marry. Well, three weeks later, let's meet again, see any improvement has made, ok? Ok... - Is that good? - Good. You pissed! Is that alright? Wear your trousers. Let daddy carry you, ok? No, I want mom. Never mind, I'll carry him. Thank you, miss ng. You're welcome. Let's go. Once the students come, I am sure I can raise their interest. Miss Lee, may I be excused. Mr. lam. Are you interested? What? Right here? No, are you interested in joining the astronomy club? To watch stars? I am always weak. My health doesn't allow me to join extracurricular activities. I really wish you to join us. Mr. lam... What's the matter? Fai, can you give me a hand? Sure, I won't disappoint you. May I bring my friends along? Sure! That's perfect. Fai, it's deal. Thank you. You're welcome. Hurry up, it's time for the class, don't waste time. Alright. I am no match for you! You attract so many girls here. Mr. ting. So many students have come! Yes. Let's start now. Alright. Fatty, this way. It's so pretty! Now, we are watching the starry night in Autumn. We can find some fishes. Pisces, cetus with Mira. Try to figure these fishes out! The stars are so pretty. They are turning. These appear in day time too. But the sun is too bright, so we can't see them. What's so interesting to watch stars? Why not? When you see the stars at night, have you remembered me? Have you remembered my face? I smiled more than the stars did. I am like the star in the milky way, being loved by you silently. And the shine, has killed your pain. On next Friday night, there is a lunar eclipse which appears once ten years. I wish you all to come. Are you coming? What a coincidence! What's the matter? I have to leave on that day. Hormone makes male and female attract each other. For male, it clings to the left... So they are more rational in dealing with loving affairs. When you study english literature, Romeo and Juliet you should read except the beautiful sentences written by shakspeare, the braveness of the leads are worth studying. Miss Lee, I have something for you. Thank you. When you finish your studies in the states, come back to visit us. Sure. Thank you for taking care of me in these few weeks. You're welcome. I wish you would take care of us in return. When is your flight? Ten pm. That's the exact time to witness the lunar eclipse. I'll stay with the astronomy club till the last minute. I think they've got it. You're great! You didn't need my help. It's alright, let's go on. Mr. ting, I can't see anything. Of course. Since you didn't remove the cover. So, you see nothing. Open it, then tune it. Is that alright? It's going to be done. Mr. ting, do you know how to watch it? How to watch it? Mr. ting, what lunar eclipse is? Miss. Lee, I... I have something to tell you. I bought a pack of chocolate, I wish to give it to you. Miss Lee, listen to me... I have one thing to tell you... Miss Lee... Listen to me, that chocolate... Miss Lee, that chocolate is... If you are interested in watching stars, we'll come here oftenly. Now, we don't have many members. I wish you'd help our promotion. Mr. ting. What? Where is miss Lee? She has just left by the train. What? She's just left. Mr. lam, come up and watch the beautiful stars. I'm not interested in watching it. The stars are so pretty. Yeah, Mr. lam, look! It's pretty, it's really pretty! Right? Mr. lam, the moon is right up there. Down there! She is down there. You've missed the chance to see the lunar eclipse. You've missed your flight. This is for you. I can't stay. See, you, miss Lee. See you, Mr. lam. Take care, miss Lee. Take care, Mr. lam. This is "pin eye form". Anything else which you don't understand? How about the long style of the flower? This is a very good question. I've mentioned once about this flower. Time flies silently. I have taught in this school for four years. In these four years, I have seen many people coming and leaving. Who impressed me most? Miss Lee of course. Since she makes me understand one thing. I really understand the use of school bell. It's not to remind us when to teach, when to leave and when to rest. The bell rings, it reminds us that we are teachers. My duty is to teach my students to be a good guy. F 1d, chan chun ming. What else should be written? "Bastard". Good. - Bastard. - Hurry up. Hurry up. - Mr. lam. - Mr. lam. Are you sick? We dare not do that again. Are you sick? Who wrote it? I did it. Read it. F 1d, chan chun ming, bastard. Let me read it again. F 1d, chan chun ming... Pastard. This is pastard. This is wrongly written. Bastard, how to pronounce bastard? How? Pastard? No. Speak "bastard" once again. Come on. B, it should be letter b. That's right. What letter should be written first? B. What are you doing? You still want to correct it? Clean it at once. Study hard. Be a teacher when you grow up, got me? "Two years later, the day before the summer vacation..." This is your chair. Thank you. Where are you going to? This is yours too. Thank you. Play it, see whether it works or not. She sings to me. Good... No singing please. Miss chan, I borrowed it from you, take it back please. Don't put things on floor when they do the waxing. Otherwise, they will dirty it, put it on the desk. Yes. Remember. This isn't hers, it's mine. It's yours. This is mine. Miss chan, once I felt hungry, I took your noodle, but I dared not eat it, now, I want to return it to you. Mr. wong, Mr. lam, I am leaving. Take care. Can you get it? I am angry, I don't want to answer you. Please lend me your precious stuff, I am leaving now. I've dated miss ng. Mr. lam. What's the matter? Is that yours? You can't eat chocolate during class. So, punish me.
