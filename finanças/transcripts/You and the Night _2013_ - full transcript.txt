Matthias! Matthias! Wait another moment please, he promised me to come. Matthias! Matthias... Matthias! Who are you? Who are you? Matthias? Stronger! Kiss him like a she-wolf, like a fury. Help me, hurry up. Kiss me, masturbate him. He has a hard-on. - Did you regain consciousness? - Ali, Udo. - You frightened me. - What an idea to go out in this cold! - I already feel a bit better. - You'll feel much better soon. It's midnight, guests coming and both of you look awkward. A scandal! Come on, quick! Come on! This is the dress I saw in my dream. I recognised it when I saw it. We must follow the hints in our dreams. - Even if they're terrifying? - Especially if they're terrifying... In order to overcome our fear. I'm dying of heat, I'm always hot when I wait. I used to be cold, afraid, and imagine the worst but now I love waiting. Expectation is dreaming a coming pleasure. Afterwards I'm always disappointed. - Something is still missing, isn't it? - Maybe a little bit of make up. I would like to be white, even more pale... - So pale that I almost disappear. - Don't move! I'm suddenly overexcited. I need to pee to lose my hard-on or I'll come on the first guest. That would be too bad. - You are very handsome. - So there's hope. Ali, I was so afraid earlier in the park, I went so far. All the way to the realm of the dead. It was different this time. Darker than usual. It was just a nightmare. Everything was so real. The land of the dead was ruled by children. Dead and tyrannical children. Very young boys and girls, from 6 to 10 years old. All of them died a violent death... burnt alive in their bedroom, murdered by their parents. There was no sweetness left in them. Their faces were deformed, distorted by human hatred... and the anger of not having lived longer. A little girl came up to me. I still feel her hot breath on my skin. She told me these dead children were the ones... who caused our wars, cataclysm and our most horrible crimes. Their anger was so strong... it could cross the realm of the dead to reach us. Darling, I'm here. I don't want to die. - I'm afraid to leave you alone. - Everything will be fine. Tonight you will regain strength and get back some colour. For how long? I'm tired of these parties. Embrace all those people, as if you're one of them. Matthias, promise me you won't be jealous tonight. You always want to stay. - You don't have to. - It's a delight to see you so happy. You are the one I love, the one I will love forever. Forever bores me to death, I'm only interested in the present. Stop it, I will scare everyone. - Who's here? - The Bitch. Make an effort, let's have fun... - Let's enjoy the night. - I will try. Yes, coming. Is it really the right place? Is this a contest for the most snobbish orgy? Usually, people put a mask on. Dead proles with dangling dicks, awaiting the blow. Everybody's masturbating, sperm all over and I love it. So many dicks! People doing blowjobs and fuck their socks off. We've the time of our lives! Don't worry dear, you'll fuck and you'll be fucked to death... - Like a 20 years old slut. - 24. - What is it? - A sensual juke box. It plays music according to your mood. Try it, just put your hand on. Not bad! Two people arrive together. Two guys, like it, bitch? Two guys make a good start. They opened the door, took the lift. I can feel their presence with their hot dicks in cheap underpants. It's sublime, it makes me crazy. - Udo knows already all about you. - How boring! Who's there? - The Stallion. - The Teenager. Come in please, the door is open. We met downstairs, we realized we were going to the same place. Ali, nice to meet you. - Matthias, Ali's boyfriend. - I'm Udo. As a maid... He's too young. He's not too bad. I'm the Bitch, and you're the famous Stallion? Can you get your dick out? Cool down, we are in no hurry, we're waiting for the others. We can get acquainted. No need to be vulgar, heard of elegance? No, my parents just taught me about pleasure. A depraved education is full of surprises. - Bathroom? - This way. Those who wanna fuck me, knock at the door. Speed, poppers, coke, ecstasy, something to drink? - A glass of whiskey and an ecstasy. - A glass of grape juice please. You are lucky, I almost missed the party. Tell us about it. - From the beginning? - Well, as you wish... At the age of 6, I used to write like mad. Words were easily coming. On Sunday afternoons my parents had a family teatime. I read the poems I had written during the week. Of course, the verses were naive... but the style was promising and singular. At the age of 13, things started to complicate. - The puberty? - Yes. A delirious puberty. Everything started to change in a strange way. My libido, my face and my dick. Within a few weeks my child penis became a real monster. To that extent? In the beginning I tried to hide it. Rumours spread at school. I was ashamed. I wanted to be by myself. People looked at me in another way. Boys stopped talking to me girls smiled while blushing. I felt the whole town knew it. I was a freak. Worst is I loved it. I felt powerful, irresistible... I was so totally obsessed with my dick that I stopped writing. Today I feel it claims room like an autonomous creature. Demanding more and more pleasure. But are you happy? In a way I am because I love my dick. I can watch it, touch it for hours without getting bored. And I make my living with it. People photograph it. It's a movie star. But I feel this life has nothing to do with me. I'm a poet, an artist. So I curse this dick that changed my destiny. Besides, my dick made me almost missed this party 2 hours ago I sat in police custody. What did you do? Nothing, absolutely nothing... It's as usual... because of... my dick I wanna know why I'm here. You know very well. Stop nagging or you'll suffer. Time. Where do you go? Don't leave me alone. Step back! Undress! Undress! Someone whispered about a hidden treasure in your pants. Let me imagine it. It's what I thought, impressive. On all fours! C'mon, move! Stop boasting. You don't frighten me. You are so clumsy. Fuck, I'm trapped. Get up, take the whip! Whip me! Don't hurt me! I'll do whatever you want, I'll be nice, I promise. I imagine your huge cock in my mouth. You're taking advantage of it. I can't, it's too painful, I'm like a small animal. Fuck me with your huge cock, please fuck me! I know I shouldn't.... but I'm greedy. Filthy offender, bastard! How many women have you raped? How many cars have you burned? What you don't understand is You don't understand, I'm burning for you all over! Whip me, please whip me! Stop! What I told you? Mrs inspector always gets her way. Perfect, you will come back. Now you can leave. Forget to complain, no one will believe you. Take him! Remember wherever you go, I'll find you. Help me! Help me! Help me! I'll never forget this voice. Every time I close my eyes, I imagine her face. The most beautiful face. Anyway I'm happy to be here. Earlier I thought I'd spend the night in prison... my whole life, a live in fear... stay motionless like those who tried to resurrect the wind. You must still be in shock. I feel already better, thank you. I don't want to nag... But all your stories make us want to see it. It's a pleasure... when I'm in good company. - She's the one. - Who is she? The Star. - I can't see. - My finger's on the peephole. Switch off the light, I don't want to see your face. I don't wanna know anything about you. I just want to kiss you, one after the other. And make love with you all... slowly... violently, I'll tell you. I already want you. Then I'll leave, quietly. Once the orgy is finished I'll leave, still in the dark. And you'll never hear of me again. Is it OK? Your requirements are ours. I warn you, if someone switches the light on... I'll leave instantly. Slowly open the door, greet me with your mouths. Touch me, rape me. Don't be afraid. Like that. Everything is spoiled, let me go. No way, I'm too curious. I hate fucking in the dark. Stupid girl I'd like you to stay. I enjoyed your kisses. I'd swear I'd feel you... As if I was inside you... Or as if our souls were one. - Sorry, what I say is ridiculous. - Not at all. - Go on please. - I loved your mouth, your lips. I'd also love to see your face. I must look terrible with my red and deformed face. The other ones face the wall. I want the boy to look at me. No one moves! Listen, I'm ready to stay. But first I demand something. Again! I don't want any comments on my body. I hate vulgarities. So behave normally. Resume your conversations and your activities, as normal. It cut my tracks. I don't say it because of you. Anyone want a whiskey? Miss, just before you arrived, I was about to show my dick. It is beautiful and huge. - It could perhaps boost the party. - Indeed. I only like small dicks... and also tits and bums. Really, huge things make me sick. If it make you happy, go ahead... I warn you, it's flabby. I'll take care of it anyway but let's have a look first. I adore soft balls. - Well, do you like it? - It's splendid! Is there anything more beautiful, more exciting? It smells of sex already but making love is still an assumption. A nice sleeping painter. It is so elastic, so flexible... Stop it or I'll get a boner. I feel a little better. I find everyone nice and attractive. In love you are free, enjoy yourself, with or without me. I'll watch, give a kiss, don't need more. It's strange, I've a feeling of d?ja vu. It reminds me of something... A dream? It was a dream, indeed... I remember now, I dreamed of dicks. How surprising! I was a princess... Wearing a wonderful dress. And I had an army of dicks at my disposal. Come! Come closer! Don't go there! Stand up! You can walk now. This perfume... Mum. Mum, is it you? My dear I missed you so much. Mum, my dear mum. My mother had died exactly 2 years earlier. - You still expect someone? - No, nobody else. - Who is here? - Police! Shut up! Good evening, we're looking for a 16-year-old boy. He disappeared a week ago. He was seen in the neighbourhood, did you see him? How beautiful, how hot he is! No. I would have noticed him and besides I'm only the maid. I know nothing and my employers aren't home. So you care about young boys? Yes, everyone does... My cellar is full of children. I do their hair, I disguise them, they're happy... I made them sing in an abducted children choir but it didn't work, too avant-garde. You're a dirty one. I know this kind of dirt. Don't worry, we'll wash you. You'll be clean. - Clean as a little child. - That's enough! Let him go! Who are you? I think we met before. - A distant memory. - I don't think so. I'm the owner and I don't like to be disturbed at night. Aren't you ashamed? But we are afraid. All the work pressure and the stories people tell us I understand, the phantasmagoria of evil. And sometimes even its reality. There are traps and obstacles all over, but you've to face it... with your free will and your courage. You've got courage, right? - You are very elegant. - I am indeed. In fact it's the only thing we can't be blamed for: being elegant. When my husband's away... my maid entertains me. We go shopping, enjoy jewellery. We prance around in the apartment and in the stairs, like two creatures intoxicated by luxury and coquetry. It is our secret vice. An escape from the eternal and unfortunate class struggle. We won't be arrested for it? All right boss! We've to go, an emergency. Ladies. You are lucky. Someone owes us explanations. - I thought you knew all about us. - Shut up. Come out and show yourself. Thanks. Without you both I was lost. Speak up, we're listening. I dunno where to start. I decided to live my own life. For some time my parents had bothered me. This is quite normal. As a child I also felt I was different. I used to close my eyes... and tell myself my real family was elsewhere. On a friendly planet far away. I doubt I'm better than them. But it seems my destiny is to take a lonely path. As if I was supported by a mysterious being... a being composed of the night, its inhabitants and its meetings. I stopped studying 2 months ago. But I learn from the glasses of the drunkards... and from knife fights. I love sex... I love sex and its creations. I love people making love in the night. May I? In the lights of the parking lots. In shady clubs or outside. At 4 or 5 in the morning. When only vampires and fools are still awake. They're making love... I'm alone and I just watch them. Always hoping for a date or a kiss. These never sleepers... are my siblings. They're on my wave length. It sounds a little weird but it's not. Generally it's very beautiful and joyful. I meet my fellow men and we understand each other. All these passers-by I used to meet at daytime... in the cold indifference, at night we met again to fuck. Kneeling in the bushes... we licked our faces, caressed each other with hard and cold hands. Sometimes we cried together. Did we recognize each other? It was the same thing with you when I kissed you earlier. Your oral cavity revealed more than your whole life story... - What about your parents? - I'm done with them. I tried to explain but they didn't understand. Their fear of life disgusts me. This fear is passed on from generation to generation... like a global virus. So last week, I left for good. - And the money? - I cope somehow... At night, in the streets, in the clubs... Someone buys me a drink or food. When I feel it pleases some men or some women, I request money. I always find a place to sleep I'm not close to go home. I need to learn more. When I have an orgasm, I ejaculate like a man. And I wanna do it again right away. Who'd like to dance with me? Does anyone want to dance? Are you deaf? I need to dance. Cool down. Come dance! Nobody likes me? No one wants to fuck me? Just fuck me first, no problem. We've to be lovers? Fuck off! I don't wanna be nice. Fuck your little soul problems! How can you be so naive? We're born alone, we fuck alone. Everyone's looking for their petty pleasure. Just look around. There are just jaded bodies... and faded feelings. I'm so cold. Who are you exactly? Who are you all three? Who do you think you are with your classy look? Little Bitch. You really wanna know where we come from? We'll tell you. But it's a long story. As things stand... A long time ago... A very long time ago... I'm here I'm really here, right? Yes, don't worry. I also live in a kind of dream. For a long time, I felt I was looking for happiness... being unable to find it. If I was happy, I first realized it afterwards. I said to myself: Yes, I was happy. But it just made me more sad. Today, for the first time in my life... I can say, I can say to you: I am happy. My hands are trembling with joy. Normally... I never cry. But look at me... Unfortunately... my tears will dry. And this state of grace is likely to end with night. Promise... that we'll find it again... that one day you'll make me cry for joy. Elsewhere, tomorrow, in hundreds of years... I promise... I won't die without fulfilling my promise. We didn't know that a war would start. It's an easy war, they say. We'll win within a few weeks. I'll be back before you realize I left. Please don't go. Nothing can destroy our love, it will defeat hunger and death. And he won't die... Come quickly. Matthias was lying, both of us knew it. It was a war like any other: barbaric and foolish. For two months I received a few letters. And then, nothing anymore. Later I heard Matthias was killed in the fights. Be happy young girl... Matthias sends me. What are you saying... Matthias is dead. Yes, Matthias is dead but the dead are never really dead. They are everywhere. They hang around us. Matthias called me, he begged me. I've never heard such a scream, such a will to come back to life. And I have the power to fulfil your wish. Tomorrow I'll be at the same place at dusk. - Ali. - Matthias? Don't come closer. Don't worry, I don't suffer anymore. I can't stay with you any longer, but listen to the gipsy. You can trust her. In eternal darkness, he's dreaming of dead insects and silver tombs. Sometimes I see a reflection of our past kisses. - I've almost nothing to offer. - You've got more than you think. I often watched you and Matthias before the war. I've never met such a bright, appealing couple. Here's my offer. If I succeed to revive Matthias, I want to be part of your love. Be at my side as I will be at yours. I won't be very demanding but I want to watch you making love... join your love... stay at your side like an old cat, tenderly and sexually. What a strange deal! But it's OK. If Matthias comes back to life, we'll be yours. And you'll live eternally, like me... so we can enjoy our sultry youth. You are like Jesus. Yes, but evil. I call demons, witches, ogres and beggars... to listen to my prayer and join you: O Lucifer, break the divine laws so that debauchery can reign... I implore all the havoc of the world, ancient monsters and holy transvestites... to make Matthias come back to life... and be your devoted servant. Crap mouth filthy juice... I'm drowning in it. I'm melting, I'm absorbing and I shit thousand golden suns... the crimes of burglars and villains whose spirits rape me. Oh, endless bacchanalia... Oh, threshold of darkness... Oh, burning fate, I'm death's whore, I give birth to a resurrection, now! Matthias? Do you hear me? Yes, I think. He's alive, alive! My love. - What about his face? - Kiss it. - And his eye? - I can't do anything. Death always keeps a souvenir of its guests. Listen, both of you. Matthias' life depends on you Ali, on your desire. Matthias must feel your desire vibrating and trembling. No matter by whom this desire is stimulated. What matters is the vitality. Sadness must never take over. Matthias... I will love you and desire you forever. Say hello to your new love. At the beginning of the last century I decided to be a kind of maid for them. Especially for the uniform. I'm sure you cried of joy when Matthias came back. We're introduced now. But to answer your question, no... Surprisingly... I didn't cry. I'm still waiting. Well, don't tell me you swallow the whole story. We don't care about the truth, it's their story. Have you lost faith? What time is it? The heart of the night, isn't it? Now I understand why you're so weird... Me... I'm not weird. My mind tends to wander, that's different. Everything was fine, the three of us were happy. But as always time caught up with us... slowly... First we thought it had spared us. But lately the world catches up. A distant world. A frightening world sometimes. But we must learn to like it, to accept. If you really look at it, and stay open... this world gets peaceful. So gentle we could stay there forever... stop moving, just float... float and stop to think about anything. It's true, I'm elsewhere. I'm imagining this distant world... and yet I'm here with you... I listen to you, watch you. All of you are so beautiful. That's what I wanted to tell you. I feel comfortable here. I haven't felt that well, peaceful and strong for years. One hand in this distant life and the other on your shoulder. Close to you, loving you... I think I can say, at this very moment... that I love you... that I love all of you. Now we leave... far from this sadness. Yes, all together. In the streets, in the deserted city. On the roads near the forest. It's a dream. It's a trip, will you join? Yes. Is there is something in our glasses? I feel weird suddenly. Nothing left but the night. But we're all of us seven, hand in hand. We lost our fear, we cross oceans, continents. We are old castaways. Time stopped tonight. We are immortal... we... Ali, I desire you. Come, come closer, kiss me... undress me. Matthias, come... come to us... I want both of you... I kiss you too... I'm kissing both you and Ali, may this kiss last forever... You like him, right? Are you ready to love him too? He's very special. I know, I could feel it. Stay with me, you're my leading star... Ali... Matthias. - Is there a theatre here? - Yes. A deserted theater, abandoned. A new film is showing, isn't it? My most beautiful film. A film lost forever. - Who is he? - That's him. My heart, the love of my life. He's my son... I left everything for him. I'd like to be isolated, alone with you, far from everything. Mother, I will follow you anywhere. We'll have an island on our own, I'll make you happy. I'll nurture you with my mouth. Let me kiss you. Mother, my bitter love, it's too early. Maybe tomorrow. For months we sat like that, close to each other. We dreamed to caress each other but didn't dare doing it. At the day's end we heard the same prayer. Give me a kiss, just one. Mother, my bitter love, be patient... tomorrow. My desire became stronger and stronger. I was about to go mad. Our rooms were beside each other. I used to fall asleep listening to his breath. Then... Kiss me! Wait for me tonight, I'll come to your room. Switch off the light and wear your diamond robe. Mother, my bitter love. He disappeared in the early hours. I looked for him for a long time. I hired the best sleuths, in vain. In such places where people have secret affairs with strangers... I think he may be there, expecting me... that his caresses give me pleasure... I'm thinking about him all the time. During daytime, I stay at home. I stopped the filmmaking. I'm too scared. No reason to be scared. We are together. I like you. I lied to you before. I find your dick very attractive. There are friends around, I sense them. The dead. I sense them too, they're hidden in the trees. The forest is full of spirits. You just need to say their names. Three times. Three times in a row and they appear. - From the depth of the forest. - Only for a few seconds. - For the time of a word. - For the time of a kiss. For the time of a blowjob. For the time it takes to play a scene and project it... on this shining white screen. Then they disappear forever. They can come back only once. After, nothing left of them. Mom, do you hear me? Mom... mom... mom! No! Who are you? My name is Jeanne L?ran. I died at 43 in a car accident. Mom! My name is Erwan Mertens. I died at 8 in a wild fire. My name is Claude Renan. I died at 24 of tuberculosis. Stop it... it's enough. Matthias, Matthias? But what did you do? Not tonight, it's too early. Much too early. I can't do it a second time. What about your promise? Matthias... - We have to call for help. - Don't call anybody, please! I need to be alone with him. Please. Let's go I can't stay here, it's too awful. Don't leave me alone, I need you. There is this spirit, this scream... this terrible wound. It must have happened to me long ago. Night and darkness, take me. One thing I know for sure, someone ate my heart. I remember. It's you, isn't it? Your eyes... show me your eyes. - Thank you. - For what? We two are alike, don't be unhappy, never. Our appetite is a gift, the most joyful thing in the world. We have to honour it. Don't say anything. You are young, your whole life ahead. Where do you find all this strength? Is it him? He's still around. As if he also waited for the dawn to say good bye. He's still around. He'll never leave I think. I'll miss you. - And for us, is this really an adieu? - Yes. That's the rule, that's life. A talisman of lust. You'll be less cold. I've nothing with me. But I make a wish. Vigour and poetry. It's the best I can wish you, right? What about love? Right, she is watching you. Where will you go? I don't know yet. I'll find something... A path to follow, a place to sleep before sunrise. I'd wish this night won't end... Close my eyes with it. We can accompany you a bit. The sun is about to rise, time to go. Thank you. Thanks for everything. But wait! We don't even know your name. Sacha. My name is Sacha. Sacha. I... I think I like it. Listen, don't say anything yet. Let me finish first. Well... I want you to stay with us for a while. I think... the three of us could be happy together. I don't ask you to replace Matthias. Because... it's not possible. Don't think I say this just because I'm so emotional. I love you, really, much. So do I. We love you, really, much. Damn! Maybe you'll find me old-fashioned... but I want that... I want us to be a family. We'd learn to live together. And love each other longer than anyone else. Because we'd be a family. Do you get it? Because you won't leave a family on a whim. A family's for life. We could try, don't you think so? Don't you think that... it could be very beautiful? Original subtitles: Shang for KG 16/03/14 Timing & revisions: TheHugeAnimalFromTheNorth
