About two thousand years ago in the time of Cleopatra, queen of Egypt... The Egyptians talked like this: This language was rather difficult to understand. And so, the film you are about to see has been dubbed into English. However, owing to the fact that dubbing techniques had not been perfected in this period, you may notice that the movement of the lips is not always synchronised exactly... with the words being spoken. And now, after this interesting and instructive prologue, we are... privileged... to present... a great historic ethnic drama. Astérix and Cleopatra I imposed myself to this damned talking, and I say that we Egyptians, who are the descended from the great power... has built things proudly! Well, really disgraceful have one of this! It is a shame, ridiculous! It's absurd! It's just plain silly! Nothing else to add, unless it's to say that your stable is decimate! Oh, Caesar! But you really do have to face the facts, oh Queen, Egypt is decadent. My people have built the pyramids, the tower of Souls and the temples, the obelisks! - A long time ago, my Dear Cleopatra! - Enough! I Cleopatra, will prove my people aren't decadent! In exactly three months, I'll have a magnificent palace built for you, here, in Alexandria. Very well then. If you win your bet, I will admit to you... Egyptian people are still powerful. She's a nice girl, nice. But her nose is... good out of joint. It's a pretty nose, too. - Edephus! - Yes, my Queen! I have summoned you because you're the best architect in Alexandria, not that saying very much, your building crumble. They are the laughing stock for those that don't live in them. Well, you see, actually, what I like to build is pyramids. Silence! you have three months to make good. You are to build... a magnificent palace here in Alexandria for Julius Caesar. - What, three months? - If you succeed I'll cover you with gold. If not, I will have you thrown to the crocodiles. Go! Three months! Well, I need someone who can work magic to help me do that. A magician! Oh, I got it! I know the very man! I'm willing to train him to carry the menhirs In the meantime what about a boar? - Where do I find the Druid Getafix? - Up that tree there, picking mistletoes. Getafix! What a pleasant surprise! Meet my dear old friend Edephus. He's an Architect from Alexandria. Well, I've been told to build a palace for Caesar within three months. And if I don't, Cleopatra will throw me to the crocodiles. - Are crocodiles good to eat, Asterix? - Be quiet! And if you won't help me, I'll never get it done. Now you mustn't cry Edephus, I'm coming back to Egypt with you. - I'll go, too, by Toutatis! - I'll go, too, by Toutatis! By your tongue, do you mean it? - We're off on a long sea voyage, Dogmatix. - You're not going to take him along! Why not, mister Asterix? Because he's far too small for such a long journey, Mr. Obelix. So you go and pack. Oh sure, I'm just an extra to fill in. No one ever listens to me! My friends, the best of luck to you! And I hope the sky never falls on your heads. I will now sing a for you a little farewell tune. Oh! Philistine! That was me barking, woof, woof. Can't I even bark now? All right, you idiot, let Dogmatix out of the bag. - Weight anchor now, send the bags up! - Hoist the bags up! In Egypt we'll have to contend with a lot of difficulties. And there's always the danger of meeting pirates. We'll look after the pirates, won't we, Obelix? Oh, sure! Ship to starboard! The pirates! The pirates! Yoohoo, yoohoo! Wait for us! we are coming! Yoohoo! Right then, my hearties, don't loose your nerve! We'll board them! We'll cut their throats! We'll have their guts! We'll butcher them. We want to throw them in, sink the lot of them. Same old drill as usual, boys! Wait till a I give the word, then board them! - Come on, board them! - Did you say board us? I'll be right with you. I hope I didn't keep you waiting. That's not fair. Did... Did you say board us? Did you say board us? Obelix, come on! Come on, let's go! Right, Asterix! But there's still one pirate left up there! No, no! - You say board us? - Same old drill as usual, boy! And one fine night after a long calm voyage, unbroken by further incident, the ship approaches the end of its peaceful voyage. What's that light on the horizon? That's the tower of Pharaoh, it guides ships into the harbour... We'll be in Alexandria tomorrow. A tower for guiding ships in? They're crazy these Egyptians. - Cleopatra' s bath! - Queen Cleopatra's bath!

Show him in! Oh, my Queen! These are my friends from Gaul, a powerful magician, and two brave warriors, who have come to help me in my task. Well, keep going! You really don't have much time. If you succeed, there will be gold for everyone. If not you'll all be thrown to the crocodiles. And by the way, I warn you that your rival Ardefus isn't please... that I chose you and not him to build the palace. And he's jealous. If you want to know what I think, - he'd love to see you wind up inside... - A Crocodile? That is right! Now, go! She's bad tempered, but what a pretty nose! Yes, very pretty. I'll take you to my place. That's my work there. I designed that one, too. And that's another one of mine. That was one mine, too. - And this is my house. - I might have guessed it. This blessed door is jammed again. It's the dampness. I'll just give you a little help. No! Obelix! Oh, don't scold him! The wood is still too dry. Welcome to my home. Come this way, please! Coming, Obelix! And this is where I work. Master, the architect Ardefus demands to see you. - My rival, show him in. - I'll come straight to the point. Let us build Caesar's palace together. If we succeed, then we divide the gold between us. If not, you can be food for the crocodiles by yourself. After all, there wouldn't be any need to give them two when one will do nicely. I refuse, you're a cruel, two-faced schemer. That's what you are. - Now get out of my home! - You'll be sorry for this. You'll wait, and I'll see you later... in an alligator! Ahh! - I'll take you to the building site. - Yes do Edephus, It should be... interesting to see the way you work. Dogmatix! - Are they slaves? - Oh no, those are all free workers. They're crazy these Egyptians. This is lunch hour, come and see the plans for the palace. - Why aren't those two stopping? - They are getting a little overtime. Here are the plans. I designed them all by myself. I recognize your style. Good people, don't let that wretched architect Edephus exploit you. You'll be doing too much, and you are paid too little. Stop work now! Take action against such an exploiter, leave him in the lurch! Go on strike! Go back home! Master, the workers have just told me that they refuse to do any more work. - Someone's been stirring them up against me. - But who? - Yes, who? - Ardefus, your rival of course! All this worry makes me feel ill. When the sacred crocodiles get me, I'll be uneatable! You're eager to make them a good meal? Of course, they're sacred crocodiles, after all! They are crazy, these architects! Let's see what is going on. We refuse to go on working under this condition, the work is too hard. Right! They don't want to go on working. Ah, the work is too hard. Asterix, light me a good fire under that cauldron. Give them a little demonstration, Asterix. Oh! - It works like a charm. - Of course! Bring your men on it! A little portion of this magic potion will do the trick. No! No! No! No! How does he manage to recognize me? I must do something and fast. Crewcut! - Yes, oh Ardefus, my master - I know that Edephus's expecting stone... to come down the Nile from the south. That stone must never arrive! Here is gold, Crewcut, for you to settle this business. I hear you and obey you, Ardefus, my master. My mighty master sends you this gold... to control the stone that reach Egypt. Done by Osiris. Thrown those stones overboard! Up! Up! Up! Up! Up! Up! - Up! - Up! - Up! - Up! Up! Up! Up! Up! Up! - Up! - Up! - There's no stone left. - This is Ardefus's doing. No more stone, no palace! No palace, the crocodiles! Calm down, we'll get your stone for you. Don't worry, we'll get it back as soon as we can. I hope, but we've only a month's time left to finish the palace. They must never come back from their journey alive! I'm counting on you, Crewcut! They will not come back alive, master. This is slow, too slow! Move all the ships to the back and fasten them firmly together with rope. That's what I like, a little exercise. By Toutatis, the boy never fails to surprise me! There's not much in the whale of beer or boars here. Well, you just have to eat what put before you.

What do you think of that? Dogmatix, come here! Come here, Dogmatix! Dogmatix! You leave her alone, Dogmatix! There must be a great view from up there! Dogmatix, you wait here! - Obelix! - Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear! We'd better get out of here, come on. From the top of these pyramids here, twenty centuries look down on you. - There must be a great view from up there. - Obelix you stay here! - Ah! Pyramids, give me a menhir any day. - Can't you forget Stonehenge? I wonder if they would let us visit them. Hmm, of course, ..., of course! I'm a guide... and I can take you noble foreign tourists for a visit inside the pyramids. In that case we accept with pleasure. Follow the guide. This is no place for a nice little dog, Dogmatix! Wait for me here, and if you're good, you'll get a nice bone. Absolutely fascinating pyramids! Dark blue sky told me, noble strangers! Without me, you would never get out of this labyrinth alive. Come along in here, this room boasts some magnificent hieroglyphics. Ha, ha! You will never get out of here, noble strangers. This room will be you tomb. Hee - hee - hee!... Very interesting these old carvings. Yes, but our first concern is to find our way out of here. None of this would have happened inside a menhir. All things considered, Obelix. For the very first time, I'm going to give you some of the magic potion. Honest? I'm going to have some magic potion! I'm going to have some magic potion! La la la la! La la la la! Uh, yum, yum, yum, yum! I am glad I came inside this pyramid! Obelix, after you! Can I have a little bit more? Well, you're coming? Very interesting, these mazes. How about that door there? Can I have a little bit more? No, Obelix! No! It just isn't fair! I hardly had time to take it, now he won't give me any more! It's not fair! I'm afraid that guide was right. It's just possible we won't get out alive. I'm sorry for poor Edephus. Without us, he won't have his palace finished on time. Well, I'm sorry for poor little Dogmatix's satisfier! Dogmatix! Dogmatix has tracked us down here, thanks to his nose. So he can find his way back again and shows us the way out. You'll get two big bones. You'll get lots and lots of bones. Sometimes I think he understands everything I say to him. Follow the guide. It's magic! You're all wizards! It's magic! They're all magician! They managed to get out of the Great Pyramid. Those Gauls are really fantastic! But even so, they still haven't reached Alexandria. They still have to get back up the Nile, we must stop them somehow! I know just the men you need, Master. It's a bold gang of pirates who lost... their ship on the high seas when they got on the wrong tack. - Send them to me! - They are here, Master! I will give you a boat, and you'll sail this boat down the Nile. Somewhere or other, you'll meet a fleet of ships, carrying stone. If those ships fail to reach Alexandria, you will get gold, lots of gold! Now, look! You'll board them, cut their throats, have their guts, butcher the dog. You'll do them in, and then sink them! Same old drill as usual, boys! These cruises are such a bore. I'm bored, Asterix! I have the impression that there's going to be some fun soon, Obelix. I find a fleet of ships carrying stone right head. Right, then my hearties, don't loose your nerve. It's full of Gauls! Full of Gauls! Full of Gauls? Full speed astern! Let's get out of here! A-ab... About turn! Obelix, here's something to help you pass the time, there are pirates up ahead. Real pirates? Oh, goodies, goodiesm goodies! Yoohoo! Yoohoo! Wait for me! - Faster boys, faster! - Too late! Well, I think we can get on with our journey now, Obelix. Ah, a bite! Hah! I'm not eating that fish. Well, we're on the wrong tack again. You'll know! They are beginning to get me down a little, those Gauls. Very well, if that's how it is, I have an idea, a great idea! Ha ha ha... - You have an idea, Master? - Right, a piece of cake, follow me! This pestilential pastry, poisonous pancake. - Yes! - Murderous macaroons! - Uh! Not bad. - Viper venom topped with cream. - Hurrah! - Cyanide custard pie. - Great! - Ah! Special ice arsenic cake. Oh, yeah! ♪ Pick a big bowl of strychnine ♪ cream with hemlock 'til it's green! ♪ Take of log of paraffin ♪ Warm it up and tip it in ♪ No, I'll put in two for luck! ♪ Add a spot of opium ♪ Marinade made a leech in scum ♪ Sprinkle with some chopped frog spawn ♪ Now we add a pepper corn - No! - Ah, oh, well! ♪ Crumble up your alternate ♪ In a blob of narcotic ♪ Add two spoons of caster oil ♪ Put them on the stove to boil. ♪ No, I'll put in three for luck! ♪ Put some mixed blood in a bowl ♪ Then stir in a crushed tadpole ♪ Add a thimble full of glue ♪ Add a spot of sugar, too! - No! - No? Oh, well! ♪ Add rat poison to the brew ♪ Cover venom goes in, too ♪ Sweeten it with orange juce ♪ Three segments is what you use ♪ No, I think just one will do ♪ Make in now with with mandrake root ♪ Decorate with moldy brew ♪ Just before the funeral ♪ Add a spot of stick brio. - No! Oh, yes! - Aha, I know that it will be a good idea. ♪ Special iced arsenic cake ♪ Means that we can safely take ♪ Seats beside the River Nile ♪ To see a sacred crocodiles ♪ Eat ♪ The ♪ Gauls. ♪ ♪ Barber duty good, wan wow! ♪ Yeah! - Present for you, oh Queen! - Bring it in! The three Gauls sent this cake as a gift to the Queen of the Queens. How sweet of them, you may thank them in the name of Cleopatra. My taster! Send for my taster! Coming! Coming! Coming! - Hey, taster! - With pleasure, oh my Queen. Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear! Finally my friends, you're back at last. And we bought you plenty of stone enough for you to finish the palace. Gauls, I arrest you in the name of our Queen! - Shall I smash someone? - No, Obelix! Stay calm! Let us see what is going to happen next. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!... Gauls, you were trying to poison me with that cake, weren't you? - Cake? What cake, Queen? - Throw them into the dungeon... until I have decided on their fate. There's not a moment to loose, lets drink this antidote and get out. This potion will neutralise the effects of the poison. They're just giving the royal crocodiles their appetisers. Ha ha ha... Step aside, we are coming out! May we come in? Guards, guards! Seize those three men. Gauls from the far sworn to destroy my power! I shall show you how a queen can die. Now it's the fatal hour see how a queen can die! Here I come, Osiris! Gosh, she's a good actress! No, no, no, just calm down! We simply want to know what we're being charged with? What? You're charged with that! Looks like a very good cake. Obelix, will you find me a cake knife? - May I? - Now cut three pieces of this cake. Three pieces, I said! - That's right, three! - Greedy pig! I call that an excellent cake, my Queen! What was so special about it? - Just ask my taster. - Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!... Ah! Let's see. He's just got a little touch of indigestion. That's all. Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!... This is much better, I'm hungry! I've treated you unjustly, oh Gauls! I will set you all free, you may go! Someone must have wanted to harm us. - Yes, but who? - Ardefus. - You mean Edephus's rival? - Who else? - Suppose we pay him a little visit. - That's just what I was going to suggest. - Where does Ardefus live, please? - Ardefus? That way! - Here's for our victory, Crewcut. - Uh-uh-uh! The time has come for us to drink to success. Since you wanted to work on the palace with Edephus, we're going to give you your chance. The construction of the palace is going very well, indeed, Ediphus. You will have it finished in time. Our Cleopatra is going to be very pleased. Very pleased. The palace is nearly built, Caesar. And you know, I think am going to win that bet, Julius. Delighted to hear it. Oh, my Queen. Simply delighted! I shall loose face with Cleopatra. I was told that her architect, Edephus, was only a nit wit. Something odd is going on here. Go and find, my spy! - Here I am. Here I am. - Come nearer! Go and see what's going on in Edephus building site. I want to know just why the work is getting on so fast. Quite a job, huh! Three Gauls? An old druid, a cunning little one and a fat oaf? Asterix, Obelix and Getafix, those three men can perform any kind of miracles. I must act now! Send for my Egyptian mercenaries and quick! Hail Caesar! Those who are to serve you at reduced rates, salute you. You are to get onto Edephus's building site, without anyone seen. Then, you are to knock over the cauldron of magic potion, and you're to get hold of that Gaulish druid. A bag of gold if you are successful. Get moving, by Jupiter! We are moving, oh Caesar, by Osiris! I'll see about that cauldron. You two, take care of the druid! - We get it brother! - Okay brother! If this potion is all it's supposed to be, I won't be sharing that bag of gold with either of them. By Judea, I don't have that much friendly feelings! Hey, look at that! Who are you? And where is our druid Getafix gone? Julius Caesar sent us to capture your famous druid. But our big brother double-crossed us to get all the reward for himself. Without the magic potion, without Getafix, we are lost! - The sacred crocodiles will-- - Not yet! - Obelix, let's go and get our druids back. - All right, Asterix. Dogmatix I'm leaving you here to guard the building site, watch out! Here one of the mercenaries is back, oh Caesar! Send him in! Mission accomplished, oh Caesar! You have deserved well the Caesar mercenary. Here is the reward I promised you. Have this troublesome druid locked up! I want him thrown into the dungeon of the palace! I'm the fastest. I'm the richest. I'm the-- - Where's our druid? - Caesar has had him shut up in the... dungeon of the palace. Please don't beat me anymore. - Coming, Obelix. - I will, Asterix. Big brother! I't Big brother! - Junior and me want a word with you. - Yeah. I only hope we'll be able to find out poor old druid. Well, you know, all these old dungeons are the same. It's just as easy to get in as it is to get out. - Halt, you can't come in. - Sure, we can! May I, Obelix, if you don't mind? Asterix! Obelix! Step aside, we're coming out! Oh no, you're not coming out. Oh, yes we are. You meant, you're coming out. What you say? The druid have escaped from prison? Those Gauls will soon find out what it means to brave Caesar' anger, by Mercury! Tomorrow, when they are waken, I will have a little surprise waiting for them, and I think you will like it! Master! Master! The building site is deserted, none of the workers have returned here to work. What's going on? What happened now? In the name of Caesar, we hear some Gaulish troublemakers are hiding... on this building site. We order them to surrender, If they don't we shall attack, by Jupiter! We don't want to fight, but by Toutatis, if we have to, we've got the stones, we got the men and we got the Druid! You'll be sorry for this, by Mercury! What are we going to do, by our Osiris? We build our fortifications, by Belenus! You're quite right, by Belisama! Do you think we might go home now, by any chance? Do the attack! Return to the battle! Join the army, re-enlist, the man said! They are back again! La la la la! La la la la! Do the attack! See the world, the man said! Do the attack! He's nut! - You're up your head! - No kidding! If that's how it's going to be, we'll have to bombard them. Hey, look! They've got guided missiles. Huh! If they miss, I'll be surprised. Fire! My palace! They are breaking up my palace! We ought to let Cleopatra know. She is the only one who can get Caesar to stop this attack! Good idea! I'll write a letter and send it to the Queen. - And Dogmatix will deliver it for you. - Dogmatix? But he's much too small. - Dogmatix is not too small. - Obelix don't be pig headed... - Dogmatix can not deliver that message. - Yes, he can! Mr. Asterix does everything! Mr. Asterix has to be the boss! You know what Mr. Asterix has to say? No, just what does Mr. Asterix has to say? Here is the message, but how are we going to get it to Cleopatra? We are being besieged. Oh, you'd better ask Mr. Asterix. He's boss! Now, now Obelix, don't be cross! I was only teasing. My dog is no good! Dogmatix will deliver the message, and I'll deliver Dogmatix. Watch out, one of the Gauls is breaking out. - He went the same way he came. - He was only passing through. Oh Gauls from a far, who want to destroy my power! I will show you how a queen can die. - Now is the fate long-- - No, no, no! Look! My dog has brought a message for you. Oh, is he so sweet! Someone bring a bone for the dear little dog. This will never do, by Osiris. Julius Caesar isn't play fair. Right, oh Gaul! I will take care of this. Watch out! One of Gaul is breaking in. Here you are, Obelix, Dogmatix is back. He carried out his mission perfectly! Ah, you see, I was right? Let's hope Cleopatra acts quickly. Those Romans missles are demolishing the whole palace! You see, Caesar! Even if we don't manage to capture those three Gauls, it comes to the same thing. The whole palace will be destroyed. Good! Excellent! Hail Caesar, there is someone who wants a word with you, there. Oh, oh! My Queen, what a happy chance! Now we do! When I heard what was happening, I hurried out at my time. I didn't even stop to change my dress. When you make a bet, you're supposed to play it fair, and I had every right to call the Gauls, and I'll prove to you that my Egyptians can still build a beautiful palaces. And I insist that the Roman leave the builders alone, and that's all! Let me tell you that... - Yes, yes, all right, I apologise. - Ah, I should hope so, and now I'll be getting home. Well, what do we do now? Oh, Caesar! We lift the siege, foul idiot! Look at that, the Romans are lifting the siege, by Belonus! Victory by Toutatis! - Oh, Goodies, goodies! - And it's all thanks to Dogmatix! Now then, back to work. Sure enough the work gets going again, and at considerable speed. Since you will remember when architects did not finish the job on time, they were thrown to the crocodiles, a good old custom sadly neglected today. That one fine morning... Oh, my Queen! The palace is ready for you now! You have kept you words Edephus, I, Cleopatra, will keep mine. By Osiris, cover him with gold! Oh, my Queen! The loveliest of Queens! I have lost my bet, and now I yield the victory to you. Yours is the honour of cutting this ribbon, Cleopatra. I know how much I owe you Gauls, and you have earned my heart felt gratitude. I will have you sent home to Gaul on my own state galley. With the graceful thank from Cleopatra. It was nothing, Cleopatra. Goodbye now! Say, will there be any boars on this galley of yours? Obelix! You would wonder you have to keep telling me awful a tongue. This state galleys might be all very well, but if there aren't any boars, it's hardly worth making all fuss over! Everyone is eating, everyone is drinking, everyone is joyful, and celebrating the happy ending of this story. Everyone is drinking? Everyone is eating? Everyone? Well, nearly everyone. And when spring comes, Cleopatra's magnificent ship approaches the coast of Gaul, where the little village welcomes its heroes home... with its usual enthusiasm and feasting. I am a pomade to Dogmatix! Lots of ancients have nose, my dear fellows. What a nose! VictorR – 09/13/2013. Some song lyrics are hard to catch. So more precise corrections might be needed.
