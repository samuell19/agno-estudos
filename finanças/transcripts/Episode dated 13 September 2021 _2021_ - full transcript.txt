Scarlett! Ugh. Scarlett? FAINT: Scarlett? Scarlett! Mummy doesn't have time for this! Hey! Oh, lamb chop, please don't look so scared. It's me. What are you doing here? Look, look, I know that I haven't been brilliant in the past, OK? But I've changed. Really. And I am ready to look after you now. So we can just start again. She doesn't want to go. This has got nothing to do with you. You need to leave my sister alone. Sister?! Well, I'd take that with a pinch of salt. I mean, this is Kat Slater, there's probably 100 other men that could be your dad. Shut up! I'm looking after Scarlett now. Please take it from me, sweetheart, OK? Men will always let you down. You are far better off with me. OK? Hey, look, give me that key! Ugh. Well, that was clever. GLASS SHATTERS FIRE ALARM WAILS HE GROANS One of you needs to get your fingers down here. Come on, Scarlett, please. No. My mum's going to be home soon, then you'll be in trouble. I'm in trouble? You're the one holding me hostage. ALARM WAILS SOFTLY What is that noise? You're trying to kidnap her, that's what I'll tell people. Oh, you're a proper chip off the old block, aren't you? Just like your dad. You do know that he was a proper psychopath, right? I'd rather have Alfie as my dad, and that is saying something. Shut up. He was manipulative and controlling and abusive. And he tried to kill me! Is that true? Oh, darling, don't you get upset. You're nothing like him. You are an incredible and beautiful girl. And you make me so proud. You don't belong in this family. You belong in mine. ALARM CONTINUES Get away from the door. We need to get this key, now! And where's he been hiding all this time? He didn't say, but he's on his way back. Reckons he'll get here tomorrow. Tomorrow... SHE BREATHES HEAVILY Well, he's going to have a wasted trip, cos I'm going to tell him the same thing I'm telling you. The baby's not his. Now unless you want to deliver this baby yourself, you need to get out. Well, look, I ain't having that. I'm having contractions here! Look, I want answers! You had no right telling him anything! I don't want him in my life! I don't want to see him again! Look, even if there's the tiniest chance that that baby is his, he's got a right to know. Stop it, please. You can't change what happened nine months ago! All right? If Max is its dad then you can't run away from that, not forever. Right? The truth's going to come out eventually. So why don't you just save yourself a whole load of trouble? All right? Oh! Talk to me! Ah! SHE BREATHES HEAVILY ALARM WAILS HE BREATHES HEAVILY Still can't believe she's been gone a year. Longest, hardest year of my life. Thank you for these. Gray, I didn't get you them. I'm sorry, I didn't think. I did see Kheerat hanging round earlier. Kheerat? I can't be sure, though. Babe, you know what? What? It's our first Pride as a married couple. What's that mean? A few drinks and an early night? Absolutely not. It means that we stay out till the sun comes up. Call 999. Call 999! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad, Dad! Are you all right? Who else is in there? Where's Lola and Lexi? Ben, no! Ben, no! Don't, don't, don't! There's no-one in there! They're all out looking for Scarlett. Tommy's gone over the park. It was just me. Yeah, this is PC 260 from Walford Police Station. I need the Fire Service to a fire at 55 Victoria Road. This is my fault, I've handled it badly with Nancy, but she will come round, I promise you. Phil's house is on fire! Fire?! What, a real fire with flames and smoke? I can't get hold of Lola or Lexi. Oh, they've gone out shopping. Yeah, course they have, course they have. She's going to kick herself if she misses a bunch of hot firemen. What is going on? There's a fire. The last time I saw my mother she was storming over there telling me she's going to sort out Phil. Sh-She wouldn't. We need to find her now. Help! Help! SHE COUGHS Come on, come on, quickly! I'm scared. It's OK, honey. OK? I promise you, it's going to be OK. THEY COUGH Ugh. Here, here. Try this. Ow! Come on! I'm trying. Come on! Good boy. Got it. Good boy, good boy! Steady. Yes! That's it, steady. Give it to me, quickly. SHE COUGHS It's just a little bit of smoke. THEY COUGH We can't go out there. We have to. You can't just ignore this, all right? It's not going to go away. Oh... Come on, say something, anything. SHE BREATHES HEAVILY You want the truth? Oh! The truth is I really am in labour. Nah, I told you, I ain't buying this. Ooh! Oh! Ah! SHE GASPS I need Mick! SHE YELLS Oh! Ooh! Mick? Mick! FAINT SCREAMING You need to keep your mouths covered, all right? Hold your breath, stay down low, cos the smoke rises. We're going to go down the stairs and then out the front door. No! It's going to be OK, all right? It's going to be OK. Take my hand. Tommy, hold Scarlett's hand. We're going to form a chain. And don't let go, OK? THEY COUGH OK. Come on! OK, OK. Let's go. Ah! Tommy! Come on! You need to go back up! I told you not to let go! It wasn't my fault! Please, you have to go and save him! Promise me you're going to keep yourself safe, promise me. OK? OK. Go, go, go. SHE COUGHS Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! I'm not going to stand for this any more! Do you hear me? You have no respect for the sanctity of our marriage, no understanding of how much pain I am going through right now. She is not yours to grieve! Fire. What? Fire! Phil's is on fire, they must have gone out to help. Then call him! Oh! PHONE VIBRATES SHE GROANS Yeah, all right, it's going to be an ambulance, then. There's no time. Jack, I can feel it! I can feel its head or something is right down there. I might have to start pushing. No, no, no, no pushing. I don't exactly have a choice! No, listen, I'm going to go and get Mick. No, don't you leave me. It'll only take... Please, don't leave me on my own! What if something happens? Listen, I shouldn't be the one that's doing this! Yes, you should. You're its uncle, Jack. You're my baby's uncle. And it needs you. Please don't hate me. Mick knows everything. I just...I just wanted my baby to have a good life, you know, a family, and now, now he's coming back, and I-I know I can't hide forever, but I know Max. He's already taken Abi. He's going to ruin everything! Listen, he's not coming back. I didn't call him. I just wanted to know the truth, that's all. I think I need to push. Ah! Tommy! SHE COUGHS Yeah, the house is empty. As quick as you can, please, thank you. What the hell happened, Dad? Huh? I don't know. I was having an argument with Shirley and then... ..she whacked me over the head with something. So this was her? Janine! Tommy... We can't go back down that way. You need to go out the window. It's not opening. Ugh! Hey. Are you all right? You need to keep away from the house. But Mum told me to wait here. Is she inside? Looking for Tommy. Tommy? Are you sure he's inside too? They reckon Tommy's inside. Tommy? My Tommy? Nah, nah, he can't be. He went for a kickabout. Tommy's in there? SHE COUGHS Help us! I've got Tommy! FAINT: There's kids up there! Tommy! We need to move, now! I'm tired. Stay here and you die! And I can't breathe. Listen to me, Tommy. What do you want to be when you're older, huh? A footballer. A footballer, good! Good, well, footballers are brave, and they're strong, and they don't crack under pressure, OK? So I'm going to take your arms, and I'm going to lower you down. It's not far. OK? We can't go up there. Good boy, put your arms around my neck. Put your leg over. Good boy. That's it. Just don't look down there. OK? Don't worry, Tommy! You're going to be just fine! It's going to be all right, Tommy, mate! Help's on the way! I've got you, OK? I won't let you fall. OK? SIRENS APPROACH Hurry! Quick, quick, quick! Quick! Get the hose reel, get the hose reel! We'll get them, don't worry! Quick, quick! THEY SCREAM Tommy! Ugh! Ugh! Tommy! You want me to put my hand where? Another one's coming. Help me! Yes, yes, I'm trying, I'm trying! Jack! Put your hand between your legs, yeah? If you feel the head, you need to apply a bit of pressure. Because if it comes out too fast, you might...tear. You think I don't know that?! I'm just telling you what she's telling me, that's all. What? Slippy. The baby's going to be slippy! OK, yeah, yeah, I'm going to get a towel. Where are you going? Where are you going? I'll be no more than two seconds. I've just got to get a towel. Ah! When you say, "Guide the baby out..." Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, got it. Is that, uh, is that with a towel, or without a towel? Uh... Oh, yeah, right, of course. For the baby's face. Ah! Wipe the gunk off. Yeah, right, I've got it, I got it. Jack! Yes, I'm coming, coming! Sorry, mate. Yeah, I'm coming. I'm coming, babe, I'm coming. Oh, yeah. Sorry, mate, I don't usually panic. I totally got this. Yeah? Totally got... HE SIGHS BABY CRIES Don't worry, mate, I've got you. FAINT: Hey, Janine's still in there! Here you go, guys. He'll be OK. Kheerat! That window on the right. Is there anyone inside? Janine and Tommy. Oh, my God. Gray and Kheerat, they went in to try and get them out. Kheerat? COUGHING Are you OK? Are you hurt? I think I'm fine. THEY COUGH Don't worry, you're safe! Can you make your way to the window? Are you able to climb down the ladder? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. SHE COUGHS I want you to bring your hand round, put it on the ladder. We need to get out of here. I can't. Go. Stay with me. No, no, no, Kheerat. I've got a little baby girl. A beautiful baby girl. You did it. Please don't let Max take my baby. Let us be happy. Let me and Mick be a family. BABY COOS She's still not answering her phone. What has she done? This can't be Shirley. You keep my phone. I'll ask around, and I'll see what everyone says. # Shake it out, shake it out # Shake it out, shake it out # Oh, whoa-oh # Shake it out, shake it out # Shake it out, shake it out # Oh, whoa-oh # And it's hard to dance with the devil on your back # So shake him off... # Kheerat?! THEY COUGH # Shake it out, shake it out # Shake it out, shake it out # Oh, whoa-oh # Shake it out, shake it out # Shake it out, shake it out # Oh, whoa-oh # And it's hard to dance with the devil on your back # So shake him off. # Hey!

You want to hold her? Are you mad? Give her here. I love you. I love you too. How are you, Mum? Tommy, darling, I'm going to find your mum, so don't worry! Kat?! You in here? PHONE: Hi, it's Kat. Just leave a message. Thanks. Yeah, it's me again, you've got to get back here quickly, please! Tommy needs you. PHONE RINGS Oh! Kat! Crouch End?! No! Who gets a cab to Crouch End at a time like this?! DOOR SLAMS Oh, Kat! Have you seen Kat? No. No, Jean, what happened out there? Oh, it was terrible, the whole place was on fire. How? I was there. You? What do you mean, you were there? Why are you looking so guilty, Shirley? What on earth happened? Nothing. Me and Phil, we sort of had a ruck. I-I don't know. What? I don't know! I only went round there because of Tina. Tommy was in there! He's being rushed to hospital. People nearly died. What did you do? Tell them, tell them what you know. We're looking for Jean Slater. Oh, no, it's not me that you're looking for, it's... We'd like you to come down to the station and answer a few questions about a possible drug offence. RECORDING: It's me again, you've got to get back here quickly, please. Tommy needs you. No, Tommy. Where is he? Tommy! Tommy! No! What did you do to him?! I'm the one that saved him. No, Tommy...
