Munni, come out. It's enough. Shreya. Shreya, it's enough. Munni, remove those goggles. Raj... Get Shreya out of it. What is the problem? Microchip or software? The shipment from Chennai is full of damaged chips. Mom, I want ice cream. You just got out of the pool. You'll catch a cold if you have ice cream. -Have it tomorrow. -I want ice cream now. With these defective chips... How many units were manufactured with these defective chips? -Remove that costume and wear this dress. -I won't. I want ice cream. Get the microchips replaced in all the units. Change the Chinese supplier too. See to it that he bears the cost. I want ice cream now! Naidu... -Naidu. -Sir? -Check why the generator is not on. -Yes, sir. Shreya... Shreya... Shreya... Shreya! Shreya, dear. -Shreya... -Raj... Raj... Shreya... Shreya, my dear... -Shreya. -Shreya. -Shreya! -Shreya... -My dear... Shreya. -Shreya. -Raj. -Shreya, my darling. -Shreya, what happened to you? -What happened, Raj? -Shreya. What happened, my dear? -Shreya... -Shreya... -Come on, get up... Hey! Call an ambulance. -Shreya... -Shreya... -Shreya, what happened to you? -Shreya, get up. What happened to you? Open your eyes. -What happened? -I told you, to get her out of the water, Raj. Hey, Shreya... -Shreya... -I am sorry, dear. Get up, Shreya... Why did they let her swim when she has asthma? The doctor told them that swimming was good for the lungs. They are hushing it up, but the word is that they had forgotten to refill the inhaler. It's sad that even the younger one is suffering from asthma. Little one. Come here, dear. Jhanvi, Munni has removed the inhaler from her neck. Put it back. -What's your name? -Munni. Which school do you attend? -Johnson Grammar School. -Munni. Yes. You forgot this. The reports have come in. The chlorine pump in the swimming pool failed due to power fluctuation. A heavy amount of chlorine flowed into the water. That triggered Shreya's asthma attack. Anyway, they are treating it as an accident. There will be no post-mortem. No hurdles for the cremation. How many times have I told you not to touch your sister's phone? -Why shouldn't I? -Because Shreya wouldn't have liked it. -She said that I could have her phone. -Munni, you shouldn't lie. I want it. She said that she'd give it to me. When did she tell you? Well, come on. I've cooked noodles for you. I don't want any noodles. Munni... Munni, come back. Sister... Put both the legs on it, Munni. Come on, Munni. Put your legs on it. I can't live here. I am getting reminded of her all the time. Let's go somewhere far, please. I can't live here. I can't live here. A to Z Realtors... Hi. Are there any independent houses for sale? Hello. Yeah, right. The house is not bad, but I don't like the locality. I saw the house yesterday. It has to be demolished and rebuilt. We don't have much time. Rexton Property Consultants. Not in the outskirts. Show us a property within the city. Sorry. We don't want a property which is under litigation. I like the property, but there are no hospitals nearby. Sorry. I saw the house. I'm not particular about the house design, but there should be good hospitals nearby. -Is there such a big house there? -Yes. I'll check it out tomorrow. Please mail me a picture of the house. Okay, one last time. How many people have come from Japan? 12 of them, including those from administration and finance divisions. -Did their chairman like it at Falaknuma? -We put him in the Nizam suite. Others have been accommodated in high-end suites. Are these the agreement folders? I asked for leather folders. I want Montblanc, not Rollerballs. -What about the media coverage? -Yes, sir. The national and local media will be present. I'm talking to the channel heads. Instruct the protocol team to assign two people to each member of their delegation. I'll take care of their chairman. And by the way, regarding tomorrow's lunch... I hope you remember that their chairman is a vegetarian. Relax, Raj. This is the 14th meeting about this in the last three days. Everything will be fine. Yet, we don't have the right folders and pens that I have asked for. Sometimes, even the smallest mistake can result in humongous loss. You know how hard we have worked for this merger. The Japanese are very sensitive. They look at everything through a magnifying glass. -Jhanvi, please email me the speech. -Okay, sir. With the talks between both companies ending on a positive note, Rajkumar Rao's company, Technical, and Japan's Matsumoto Corporation have reached an agreement... Congrats. Are you done with it? Okay, I've sent you the location. Come quickly. So, this is your secret. But it looks like a very old one, Leena. It's been 90 years. But why such an old house? We can buy land in the suburbs and build a nice house. 6,000 square yards in the city. You won't believe how cheap we got it. They sold it as they needed money. But seriously, Leena, this house is too old. There are three hospitals within half a kilometer. With Munni's condition, we can't stay far away and take a chance. -Where's my office? -At HITEC city. There's no office here. By the way, there is no TV too. Come on. This is Munni's schoolroom. Munni, your schoolroom is very nice. See, I have a laptop too. Wow, Munni. Your laptop is much better than mine. Please, can I have it? -I want a phone too. -Why do you need a phone? You don't need a phone. You can have this. Take it. It's a walkie-talkie. Both of us will have this device. -We can talk to each other. -Wow. If you switch this on, we can hear each other. Okay, stay here. I'll go downstairs and talk to you. This is not a walkie-talkie. It's a baby monitor. If she makes a sound at night, we can hear her. Are you sure homeschooling her is a good idea? Think again, Leena. I need to be with Munni till her lungs get better. I have to keep myself busy. Otherwise I won't be able to forget Shreya. That's why I need no servants. I want to do everything myself. Thank you very much. You didn't say "no husband." Munni can have steam sessions here. The doctor says it will be good for her lungs. -There is little more work to be done. -Hello... Hi, Mommy, where are you? I'm downstairs. Come, let's set the table for dinner. You have forgotten something. Put the plate in the sink. Hey... You're breaking the rules. No using of gadgets before bedtime. Give it to me. This walkie-talkie should be here when you sleep. Get some sleep. Is she asleep? She's trying. -Why don't you tell her a story? -I'm too tired. Do you like the house? I like it. Did you really like it or are you trying to please me? I'm just trying to please you. Do you think Shreya would have liked it? Munni, keep that aside and sleep. Hi, Sister. How come you are here? You came to see me! Why? If we go out now, Mom will get angry. Mom doesn't sleep so soon. Wait, let me check. Munni, why are you out of bed? Will you come to play tomorrow? I'll keep it a secret. I won't let anyone know about you. Get in here. -What are you eating, dear? -Cereal, Dad. -What did you prepare? -Broken-wheat upma. Yuck! I'll eat cereal too. Leena, why did you buy this cereal? It contains almonds. Oh, God. It's not mentioned on the pack. You should be careful while buying. The packaging is wrong. -We should sue these guys. -Give it to me, Dad. You shouldn't eat this, dear. It contains nuts. Leena, make French toast for Munni. She likes it. I don't want French toast. I want cereal. -Is there any other cereal? -No. Okay, then make pancakes. Munni and I will eat pancakes. I don't want pancakes. I want only cereal. Stop it. You shouldn't eat this. I want only cereal. I want cereal... Then no breakfast for you today. What happened? She threw these things at me as I took her cereal away. -Munni... -I'll deal with you in the evening. Come, let's clean this mess. What you did is wrong, dear. Daddy could have been hurt. What made you so angry that you hurled plates and glasses? I didn't do it, Mom. -Hey, if it isn't you, then who was it? -I didn't do it. I'll slap you. Don't you dare lie to me. I didn't do it... Munni, come here.. You threw the stuff and they are blaming me. Why can't they see you? Where shall we go? No, Sis. Mommy will scold me again if we go out. Hey... I've told you to clean it up. Come on. What are you looking at? Come downstairs. -I won't go. -You won't go? I wasn't talking to you. Hey. Don't be stupid. Who else is here other than me? Let's go. You have to clean up your mess. That's your lesson for today. Dump it in the trash can and wash your hands. Then I'll teach you the alphabet. Mom always makes me do all the work. Run away from home? Where to? No one would scold me at this nice place? Dad sometimes hits me, Sister. Yes, you are right. Mom and Dad will learn to behave if I go missing. They'll stop hitting and yelling at me. When will we come back? If it's going to be that long, I need to pack my stuff. -Kid, where are you going? -Open the gate. -Why? Where's your mom? -Open the gate. Ma'am, Munni is asking me to open the gate to go out. -Let me go. -Listen to me. You shouldn't go out. -Let go. -She'll be angry. -Let go of me... -Munni, what's the matter? She wants me to open the gate, ma'am. Where are you going? I'm leaving home. I won't stay here. -Why, dear? -I'll leave... Make sure the delegates have a good time. Did you plan any sight-seeing? Yes, sir. Film City, Chowmahalla Palace... -Yes, Leena. -Are you busy? -No, what is it? -Munni tried to leave home today. What? Where to? I don't know. The guard stopped her when she was leaving with a suitcase. I think you need to spend some time with her, Raj. Come home if you aren't busy. These Japanese want the estimates for the advertising budgets. Jhanvi is on leave. We need the figures urgently, sir. Contact her wherever she is or do something else. -Where is she? -She's outside. I spoke to her. Don't bring up that topic. -Why did she try to leave home? -She is angry with us. Did you get her anything? You didn't tell me to. You are so dumb, Raj. Couldn't you think of it yourself? -Hi, dear. What are you doing? -We started with alphabet today. Wow. How many letters did you learn? Just one. "A." What is "A" for? Tell me, dear. Munni, "A" for? Munni, "A" for? Akka. Hey... Why do you say that? You named fruits starting with "A." Akka is a Telugu word, not an English word. Munni, I want to show you a funny alphabet song. You will laugh out loud. Watch. A for ANDAR-WARE B for BHEJI-TABLES C for CEE-SHORE D for DELE-PHONE E for EEDIOT -Eediot. -F for FOLICE G for GEEBRA -He says Geebra... -H for HOSTRALIA I for INGLAND J for JEROX COPY -Jerox copy. -K for KAMPUTAR L for L-E-PHANT M for MMMEDIAT-LY N for NIKKAR -Nikkar! -O for OS-PITAL P for PULL-STOP Q for Q-RIOSITY R for R-MEE S for S-KIMO T for TA-SHUN U for UMTABH BACHCHAN -He says Umtabh Bachchan. -V for VIFE W for WOMIT -Womit. Yuck! -X for X-AMPLE Y for Y-PER Z for ZOOPERMAN Zooperman! Play it again, Dad. I'll play it, but you have to promise me something. You shouldn't eat anything that has nuts. If Mommy and Daddy tell you not to eat cereals or chocolates you shouldn't eat it. Promise me. You're a good girl, sweetheart. Hello. I'm coming. -What's the progress? -We have installed steam nozzles. We've brought glass and acrylic for the door and windows. Which one do you want? Which one will prevent heat from escaping? Glass has higher heat reflectance. Whereas acrylic needs to be replaced. If we double panel this unbreakable glass, it will be stronger. A for ANDAR-WARE B for BHEJI-TABLES C for CEE-SHORE D for DELE-PHONE E for EEDIOT F for FOLICE Is that the alphabet song, dear? My daughter loves it too. When it goes U for Umtabh Bachchan, it'd leave her in splits. How long will it take to fit the glass? We are expecting guests. The glass is cut and ready. It takes a couple of hours to fix it. Bring the glass inside. Daddy... Daddy, see this. Which hotel has a Japanese restaurant? -No, that's a Chinese restaurant. -Dad... -Look at me! -Japanese food is different from Chinese. Daddy, look. Check if it's available at the ITC. Daddy... See this. Yes, for lunch. Their top management and our staff. Daddy, look at me. A single table for all. -Dad, I've got both my legs on it. -Japanese wine too. Japanese wine, not Indian wine. Daddy, I have got both my legs on it. We need not import it from Japan. We can get it locally. -Raj, Munni is trying to talk to you. -Daddy... One second. Stop it, Munni. I am on the phone. Be quiet, okay? If they don't have enough tables, book the whole restaurant for three hours. Raj... Have you gone mad? She knocked me down with her scooter. Leena, we need to take her to a child psychiatrist. I'll talk to her. You carry on. Why are you getting so angry these days, particularly with your dad? Did he scold you? Dad suffered a terrible fall. Why did you thrust the scooter on him? I didn't do it, Mommy. Then did the scooter hit your dad of its own accord? Munni, if we do bad things to other people, worse things will happen to us. We like Daddy a lot, don't we? Yes or no? Yes. Will you say sorry to him when he comes home? But I didn't push the scooter, Mom. Well, let's think it was an accident. You should apologize for the accident. Okay? Okay. Get dressed and come to the steam room. Come inside. Shall we switch on the steam? Breathe in through the nose, breathe out through the mouth. Breath in through the nose, breath out through the mouth. Your asthma will be cured if you do this every day. -Will you do it? -Yes, Mommy. If you want to talk to me when you are inside, press this button to talk. I can hear you from anywhere in the house. Okay? Go upstairs and learn the names of fruits beginning with A. I will finish up the work here and we will start with the letter B. Okay? Yes, let's leave. Mom is busy. -Munni is trying to get out, ma'am. -What? -Please come down, dear. -Hey, let go of me. Let go of my hand. Let go. Smells good. What's for dinner? -Prawns curry. -Oh. -Where's the little imp? -In her room. She's grounded. What did she do? She tried to leave the house again. She did it again? I tried to talk to her. She wouldn't tell me anything. Should we take her to a doctor, like a child psychologist, to find out the problem? Not yet. Let's hire a full-time babysitter. Let's wait for some time. The babysitter is confirmed. We got the details. Nutella. -There is no Nutella in the house. -I want Nutella. Dear, you shouldn't have Nutella. It is made with nuts. You have made a promise that you wouldn't eat anything that we don't approve of. You've forgotten your promise. Make a promise again. You're a good girl. -Vinod. -Your babysitter has been vetted. She is a widow from Vizag. She has a brother who lives there. Okay. Thanks, man. It's Vinod. He says the babysitter is good to hire. Well, where are we with the alphabet classes? We are still stuck at "A." She is very busy. We can go further if she gets free. I'm not busy. It's you who has been busy. Oh! You shouldn't talk like that to your mom. Ma'am, a woman named Kamala is here. Send her in. Come in, Ms. Kamala. Mommy made a dosa for me this morning. It was delicious. Do you want to eat a dosa? Raj, this is Ms. Kamala. -She's our little girl, Munni. -Hello, dear. Ms. Jyothi has told me everything. Ms. Kamala, you have to keep an eye on Munni all the time. Never leave her alone. -Leena, tell her about Munni's allergies. -Okay. -Bye, dear. -Bye, Leena. Munni shouldn't eat anything made with nuts like almonds, pistachios and peanuts. She is allergic to them and her lungs get blocked. It can be very dangerous. Be careful with her. She should always wear this inhaler. If she removes it, please put it back. If she makes a fuss, call me. You shouldn't annoy her. Show her your schoolroom. I'll call you once breakfast is ready. You can keep your bag in the room beside the stairs. This way. Wow! Your schoolroom is very nice, Munni. What shall we do now? We can do anything you want. What do you want to do? Let's play. You want to play. What kind of game? Hide and seek. -Hide and seek? -Yes. You role-play as a cop and I, a robber. Close your eyes and count to ten. I am going to hide. You shall come and catch me. Where are you going? Put it inside and come for breakfast. I don't want breakfast. Ms. Kamala, don't let her out of your sight even for a second. Take her inside. Give it to me. Hey, Munni, you have a lot of board games. Hey, Monopoly! I love Monopoly. Let's play. If I had so many board-games, I would never leave this room. Hey... I saw it. Oh, God! Oh, God! Ms. Kamala... Ms. Kamala... -Ms. Kamala... Wait. -Oh, no! I can't stay here. Munni, do you know what this is? Come, I'll show you. Munni, Mom and I want to ask you something. Can we ask? -Do you like Mommy and Daddy? -Yes. Do you like us a lot? If you like us so much, why are you trying to go away from us? I'm asking you, why are you trying to leave the house? Okay, leave it. -Why did you scare Ms. Kamala away? -I didn't do it, Daddy. Mom was downstairs, and I wasn't home. You were the only one with her. You must have done something. I didn't do it, Daddy. Who else could it have been if it weren't you? Sister did it. Your sister couldn't have done it. She is dead. -She wouldn't do such things. -Yes, it was her. Did she throw crockery at me and hit me with the scooter? She died because of you. That's why she attacked you. You'll kill me too. That's why I want to go away from you. The house is fully secure. Is it done, Kiran? Yes, sir. Even if Munni opens a window, the alarm will go off. If you don't enter the code within 30 seconds the police station would receive a signal. And they'll be here within five minutes. Enter a code that you can remember, Leena. Got you, little thief! Caught you! Munni, do you know what I do when I catch thieves? I put them in jail. -Shall I put you in jail too? -No, sir. You are very naughty. We have a jail for mischievous kids too. -I'll lock you up there. -I'm not mischievous. But your mom and dad say that you're full of mischief. They are lying. Then, we have a jail for liars too. -Shall we lock up your mom and dad there? -Yes. You're a good girl, sweetheart! Leena, don't worry if you forget the code. The alarm can be disabled from the police station. Thanks, buddy. I think I should resign from my job and become his personal security officer. -You guys always keep me busy. -Sorry, man. See you later. I need to get to the office. That's it. We can't go out now. How can we go out? The alarm will go off if we open any door. What's your idea? -Mommy. -What? -Where is Dad? -He went to work. I'm hungry. -Lunch is ready. -What did you cook? -Dal Rasam and potato fry. -I don't want it. I want a pizza. Place an order. -What kind of pizza? -Cheese pizza. The delivery guy is here, ma'am. Hey... -Ma'am. -Where's the delivery guy? -He is at the door. -I don't see him. -Hey, what are you doing? -The box just flew out of my hand. -Shut up! Is that our pizza? -No, I'll cancel the order. Hey, stop! Hey... Stop... Hey... Stop. Stop... Stop... Stop... Stop... Munni... -Munni... -Stop there. Stop there, man. Hold on... Stop... Why did you come out of the house? Why did you get on to that scooter? You won't listen to me, will you? You're going to continue with this. -I'll tell your Dad. -Please, Mom, don't tell Daddy. No, I'll tell him what you did. He'll know what to do with you. Please, Mom. Don't tell Daddy. He will beat me. If you don't want me to tell him, you should stop behaving like this. What do you say? Mommy, am I a bad girl? Not at all, sweetheart. Inhale this. Give it here. It's empty. The medicine is over. -Are you okay? -I'm okay, Mommy. Okay, go to sleep. I'll go and get the refills. Raj... Raj... Raj... -Raj. -What is it? -Munni is missing. -What! I put her to bed right here. She is not there now. Where might she be? Stop crying. She must be around here. Raj... Munni... Munni... Munni! Munni... Munni... Munni... Munni... Munni... Munni... Munni... Munni... Munni... -Come to the main door. -Okay, sir. I'm coming. -Who was on duty last night? -I was. -Did you see Munni go out? -No, sir. -Were you awake? -Yes, sir. Where is Munni? Where is Munni, Raj? What happened to her? She left this behind. What will she do if she suffers an asthma attack? I was planning to pay you a visit. What's the matter? Let's go inside. What happened? Yes. We put her to bed last night. She was missing in the morning. -Did you search the whole house? -We did, she is nowhere to be seen. Didn't the alarm go off? -No. -Did you check the CCTV footage? We did. There was nothing. It's like she just disappeared. Let me see the footage once. This is last night's footage. That's Leena coming back from the supermarket. She checked on Munni before going to bed. What's this? Play it again. Leena, see this. Let's go back a little more. Raj. What's happening here? She said that she didn't do it. I didn't believe her. This is no ordinary missing case. I hope you understand that. There is an unwanted guest in this house. Unwanted guest? What does that mean? What do we do now? Please help us. Where is Munni, Vinod? Leena, you both need to calm down. -Let me make a phone call first. -Please handle this delicately. First, it was Shreya, and now Munni. I have a merger going on. The media will make me their target. Don't you think I understand that? This guy isn't answering the call. Sit tight. I'll go and get him. -Who is he? -Spirits. There isn't much difference between spirits and animals. Take dogs for example. If you approach them with fear, they try to scare you more. But when you put up a brave face and ignore them, they leave you alone. It's the same with spirits. They scare only those who are already scared. They possess cowardly and psychologically weak people. Oh, God... This guy's name is Yadayya. He habitually slept outside his house. Wicked spirits used to trouble him every night. Oh, my God! Your seniors learned about this case and gave Yadayya an idea. Come on, you stupid spirits. I am going to burn all of you today. I dare you. That's it. The spirits stopped troubling Yadayya. Her name is Lalitha. Her husband was having an affair with her sister. She was devastated when she came to know about it. Moreover, her husband used to abuse and assault her. She became a mental wreck and attempted suicide. As Lalitha was psychologically disturbed, a spirit considered her a good host. The spirit possessed Lalitha. And she tried to kill her sister and husband. What happened to Lalitha after that? With that, the spirit left Lalitha's body. Scared of Lalitha, her husband mended his ways. They are happy now. There is one common factor in both these examples. Can you tell me what that is? Heat. When Yadayya threatened the spirits with fire, they left him alone. When I burnt Lalitha with a cigar, the spirit left her. Spirits are afraid of heat. You would have seen a lot of people with scars on their foreheads, about the size of a coin. This is an old technique passed down by our ancestors. In olden days, in order to drive out spirits, they used to burn people with cigars. So you say that if we smoke cigarettes and cigars regularly, the spirits would leave us alone. What brings Mr. Sherlock Holmes here? Sherlock Holmes needs Dr. Watson's help. A close friend of mine is in big trouble. This is not something the cops can handle. Hello. I am Pavan Sharma. I'm Raj. This is my wife, Leena. Vinod has briefed me. -When did you move in here? -About four to five days ago. Raj, I can't take it if something happens to Munni. Nothing will happen to Munni. She'll be safe. Where did you see the child last? Right here. I put her to sleep. Generally, kids like to hide themselves. Did she do stuff like that? No, sir. But after we moved here, she tried to get out of here many times. What do you mean? She tried to run away from home a few times. We were able to stop her luckily. There are cameras all over the house. Can I check the footage? This is definitely the work of a wicked spirit. Munni is with the evil entity. But, Mr. Sharma... why would a spirit want to take Munni away? And where would it take her? If we can find out why it took her, we can track where it took her. Anyway, I have to check something. I'll go upstairs and be back. Watch my movements. How did you get out? You evaded the camera. There are a lot of blind spots not covered by the cameras. If you follow them, you can avoid the cameras. How did you get past the security alarm? Through the exit at the rear of the house. Why is that door not connected to the alarm? Rear exit is not secured? We don't use that exit as we don't have servants. The security guys must have missed it. We didn't notice it too. The spirit took note of this mistake. This spirit has a purpose and plan, and the intelligence to execute it. Anyway, have you noticed any change in the kid's behavior after moving into this house? I mean, other than trying to run away from home. Other than that, anything strange in the child's behavior? Munni has always been a moody child. Thought she'd get better with time. But I felt her behavior had gotten worse after coming to this house and scolded her a few times. But now I know that it wasn't her fault at all. She thinks I'm responsible for the death of our elder daughter. -Maybe that's why she is angry with me. -How did she die? She suffered an asthma attack while swimming, and we lost her. Munni too suffers from asthma. Sugar clock. I have to eat something. Are there any biscuits or cookies at home? I'll check. Snicker bar. Nowadays these things come loaded with nuts. Can you eat chocolates if you're a diabetic? Borderline. Chocolates are fine sometimes if there's nothing else. Nuts in this provide a little energy. Munni should not eat nuts. If she does, it triggers an asthma attack. Then why do you have these? Is it for you? No, no. Leena and I don't eat chocolates. We don't even buy them. Then where did this come from? There is a whole box of them. We don't bring chocolates home, and definitely not the ones with nuts. Someone bought these yesterday. Leena went to the supermarket last night to buy inhaler refills. -Why would she buy chocolates? -Maybe she felt like eating one. Someone opened it and took a couple of chocolate bars. Let me check with her. She's not answering. Leena... Leena... Leena... Leena... Leena... Leena... Leena... Why did you buy those chocolates last night? I'm asking you. Leena... Leena! Leena... Leena... Leena... -Hey, Leena! -Hey... Raj... Raj... Raj... Raj... What is that? A woman possessed by a spirit or a spirit possessing a woman. I weigh 95 kilos. She easily lifted me into the air and threw me down. A spirit is like steam. Without boundaries to define it, it's powerless. The steam that's generated while cooking can only shake the lid of the vessel. But the steam inside a pressure cooker or a steam engine has tremendous power. She can do anything with such power. The human body is like a pressure chamber for a spirit. The pressure of the spirit inside the body can make a person do anything. A powerful spirit has possessed your wife. How can Leena be possessed by a spirit? What spirit? Whose spirit? I can't answer all your questions, Mr. Raj. But I'm sure that this spirit has done something to your child. It has taken her somewhere. When did your elder child pass away? Are you saying that Shreya's spirit possessed my wife and took Munni away? Our entire focus should be on finding Munni. After watching the CCTV footage, locating the blind spots and seeing Leena's condition now, I am able to connect some dots. This spirit failed to take Munni away on its own, so it possessed your wife and made her do it. You mean, Leena has taken Munni... Taking aid of the blind spots, your wife took Munni somewhere last night. Where could she have taken Munni? -Vinod. -Did you get any leads? It's Leena. She's possessed by a spirit. She took Munni out in her car last night. She told Raj that she was going to a supermarket to buy inhaler refills. Did you find anything on Munni's whereabouts? Yes. Soon we'll find out everything. Kiran, I've sent you a photo and an address on WhatsApp. Just visit the supermarkets near that address and check if the lady in the photo visited any of them recently. God knows where and how the poor girl is. I can't bear this. -What is this? -Don't ask me what this is. The spirit is not in her now. She doesn't remember what she did when she was possessed. So she doesn't remember where Munni is? I've told you that she doesn't remember what she did. -How can that be? -Why don't you try finding out? Go ask her why she bought the chocolates. No, I won't. You ask her. Why should I? She is your wife. You ask her. But you are the expert in these matters. I sure am the expert, but she's your wife. And you sport a huge physique. -Please. -Damn. Want to have a word with you. Can you tell me why you have chocolates in your house? Our daughter is missing. It's heart-rending. Please tell us what happened to our daughter. We can talk about chocolates and biscuits later. We want our daughter back. Please bring her back. What did I tell you? She doesn't remember anything. This is stupid. I'll ask her myself. Leena, where did you take Munni last night? Answer me. Mr. Sharma... Only the spirit can tell us where Munni is. The spirit must possess Leena to provide us answers. If the spirit leaves Leena, Leena won't remember anything. Leena, where did you take Munni last night? Please tell me, Leena. Rajkumar Rao! You coward! Where are you hiding? Show yourself. Leena, please tell us where Munni is. Does the lady in this photo come here to shop? Bring Leena to the steam room somehow. Yes, Kiran. That lady is a regular shopper at the store near her house. But she hasn't been there the last week. Rajkumar Rao! Where the hell are you? Today you are done for. Hey, show yourself! Leena... Where is Munni? I've sent you a mobile number. Track the number's locations during the last week. Coerce the mobile operator for details. If there is one thing spirits can't take, it's heat. -Yes? -I've tracked that number. I've sent you the final location. But there was another mobile number along with the one we have been tracking. -Whose number is it? -It's Rajkumar Rao's. Tell me. Where is Munni? What did you do to Munni? Ask him. Tell him to say what he did to me. Who the hell are you? He knows me very well. Tell him what you did to me. Please tell us where Munni is. Munni is all that we have. We can't afford to lose her. Do you feel it? Are you feeling the pain now? My parents too are searching for me. They are devastated not knowing what happened to me. I don't understand what you are saying. Munni is a little girl. Please tell us where she is. Munni is going to die. She will wake up from sleep. She will be hungry. She will find chocolates in her hand. She will eat them. She will die unable to breathe. She will die. Please don't talk like that, Leena. She is our kid, Leena. Where is Munni? Please tell me. Speak up! Where did you hide Munni? Raj... Leena... Leena is in pain. Temperature has hit danger levels. If we maintain this heat, her flesh will fall off her bones. If she doesn't tell us, we'll have to let her out. Or Leena would be in danger. What is this, sir? We have lost Shreya, Leena. We can't lose Munni too. Please tell me where she is. Where is Munni? My parents too have lost me. You made sure that they can't even find my body. What did you do to my dead body? What dead body? I don't understand. Tell me! Reveal the whereabouts of my dead body! Please answer her if you know. Leena is in grave danger. If the spirit leaves Leena, we would never know where Munni is. Come on, tell me! Who are you? What is your name? Tell me. Tell me! Will you reveal it or not? Tell me. Where did you hide Munni? What is your name? Tell me! Tell me! Tell me now! Jhanvi. My name is Jhanvi. Jhanvi, Munni has removed the inhaler. Put it back. -Johnson Grammar school. -Munni. Yes? Mommy, I'm hungry. Raj. What's the matter? Disable Rajkumar Rao's security system. Answer me. We can't keep Leena inside for long. Who is Jhanvi? Jhanvi has been missing since the night before the merger. Her parents have filed a complaint. You were the only person with her before she went missing, Raj. My executive assistant. My employee. She is dead... ...because of me. Because of you? How? She came to my office to join as a management trainee. Your professor has written in this recommendation letter that one must be totally stupid to not hire you. Do I look stupid to you? It would be really stupid not to hire you. The next day was the merger. My life's biggest achievement. All of you know how hard we worked for this merger. Sometimes, even the smallest mistake can result in humongous loss. Jhanvi, email me my speech before you go. Yes, Mom. Are you back home, dear? No, Mom. I'm still at work. Did you have dinner? Not yet. I'll get something from the supermarket on the way back. I'll call you once I reach home. Why are you ignoring me of late? Don't put on an act. Don't you know that I like you? Sir, please leave me alone. People in the office are gossiping about your special care towards me. I've emailed you your speech. Jhanvi. Jhanvi. What's the problem? Am I too old for you? Just feel this once, these youngsters are no match for me. Is it because I'm a married guy? This is different. Don't worry about what people say. I've planned something for us to be together after this merger. Once you hear my plan, you will know how much I like you. Are you listening to me? Jhanvi... Jhanvi... Jhanvi... Jhanvi... My world just collapsed around me. The next day was the multi-million dollar merger. I was scared that Leena, my family and my whole life would slip away from my hands. I didn't know what to do. Come on. Tell me! Where is my body? Tell her, Raj. St. Joseph's cemetery. It's at St. Joseph's cemetery. Now tell me where Munni is. Where is Munni? Leena... Leena. Leena. Leena... Leena. Where is Munni, Leena? Where is Munni, Leena? Please wake up, Leena. Where is Munni? Call an ambulance now. -Munni... -Daddy. Did you eat the chocolates? Did you? I promised you that I wouldn't eat anything with nuts. You are a good girl, sweetheart. You are a good girl. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I'm sorry, my darling. Why did Jhanvi's spirit possess Leena and torment Raj? After the life exhausted from her body, the spirit must have thought that it was still alive and would have escaped from the car. When it returned to the car, her body wasn't there. More than her death, Jhanvi couldn't bear the pain her parents went through not knowing her whereabouts. Where is our daughter, Jhanvi? Tell me. Besides wanting to let her parents know where her body was, she wanted Raj to feel the pain of missing his daughter. Only then would Raj admit to the truth. Only Raj knew the whereabouts of her body. As Raj naturally wouldn't admit his crime, she tortured him till he admitted it. With her parents finding her body, Jhanvi's spirit must have found peace. That's why I come to you for cases like this. Don't be so modest. You have just closed two cases. How did you learn that Raj was behind Jhanvi's disappearance? I came to see Raj as Jhanvi was his employee. But he said Munni was missing, so I couldn't ask him anything. Being the intelligent man that he is, he had hid the body at a place we would never look for a dead body. He deleted all the CCTV footage at his office that would incriminate him. He sent Jhanvi's leave application from her own phone. Are you listening to me? But... his phone was right next to Jhanvi's phone until it went dead. So we were able to nab him. -Leena? -You said you'd come for dinner? I am waiting for you. I am coming. Sometimes the smallest mistakes made by criminals help us solve some of the biggest cases. -Oh, no... -Look at my Jhanvi... -Oh, God! Look at my little girl... -Oh, God... -Oh, no... -My dear... But this is a case of a freak accident. It's not a murder case. What are you going to do? Court will decide that, Mr. Sharma. Are you going to leave the fate of your friend to court? I've done what I have to as a cop. Now I'll do what I need to do as a friend. Inspector...
