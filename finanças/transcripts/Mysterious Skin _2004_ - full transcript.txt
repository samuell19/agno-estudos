♪♪ (boy) The summer I was eight years old, five hours disappeared from my life. Five hours... lost. Gone without a trace. (rapid breathing) Last thing I remember, I was sitting on the bench of my little league game. It started to rain. What happened after that remains a pitch black void. (girl) Brian? Brian? (door creaks) You dork, what the heck are you doing in there? Hey... you're bleeding. (thunder rumbling) Whoo! It is terrible out there! Mom! Well, hello, sweetheart. What happened to you? Brian got a bloody nose hiding in the cellar. Whatever on earth were you doing down there? Are you okay, sweetheart? Ohh, oh, you poor little baby. They had me cooped up all night in that awful mail room. I didn't even know it was raining till I got off work. - Hold still. - Ow. Didn't one of the other moms give you a ride home? I'm going to bed. I hope you're happy. I knew he'd get hurt playing sports out there in the field. You know, when I was a kid, I wasn't exactly a star player, either, but at least I gave it my all... I wasn't a quitter. Sorry, Dad. (sighs) Good night. I told your father that little league thing was a stupid idea. Hold your nose. (water bubbling) Mom made me quit baseball the very next day. (thunder rumbling) (breathing hard) (gasps) This was when the nightmares began... ...and the nose bleeds. I wet the bed several times... ...and then there were the blackouts. I'd feel my eyes roll back in my head. I'd crumple to the floor like a dropped puppet. The darn thing's not even a year old yet. Maybe it's screwed up from all the lighting last week. Oh, your father's going to be overjoyed about this. (girl) What time's Dad getting home? Not for another hour, at least, honey. Mom, Deborah, come look! It's a UFO! Oh, please, it's just a weather balloon or something. No, look what it's doing to the TV. (static) It's flying over the house! Let's go up on the roof. No, wait! Children, be careful! (crickets chirping) (Brian) That summer, those were the two things I'd never forget. The cramped, stale darkness of the crawlspace and, equal in power and mystery... that UFO, out there somewhere, traveling across the universe. The summer I was eight years old, I came for the first time. I was watching my mom going at it with her boyfriend of the moment, Alfred, in my old swing set. Alfred was all Marlboro man, dumb as a fucking rock. What I would, years later, come to call "my type." (Alfred and mother laughing) And only the most boring, stupid things would ever come out of his mouth, but... seeing him like this, whimpering and grunting like a helpless animal, I couldn't take my eyes off of him. (Alfred grunting) (groans) (grunts) (sighs) I'd been masturbating for years, but it wasn't till that summer that jizz actually squirted out my dick when I came. Couldn't wait to show Coach. Oh, maybe I should start at the beginning. Back in June, my mom signed me up for Little League. Well, it was Alfred's idea... a way for them to fuck freely, without the expense of a sitter. Are you excited? (mother) Coach Heider? Desire sledgehammered me. He looked like the lifeguards, cowboys and firemen, I'd seen in the "Playgirls" that my mom kept stashed under her bed. Back then, I didn't know what to do with my feelings. They were like, a gift I had to open in front of a crowd. - Hello. - Hello. I'm Ellen McCormick. And this is my son, Neil. Hello, Neil. Honey, don't you want to say hello to your new coach? (laughs) Don't worry, it takes him a while to warm up to strangers. I quickly became the team's star player. Which wasn't saying much, considering the other kids were a bunch of hopeless spazzes. Our first game, bottom of the eighth, I whacked a triple with bases loaded. The crowd went fuckin' nuts. But I didn't care about that. All that mattered was it made Coach proud. After that first victory, the coach called my mom to tell her he was taking the team out to a movie to celebrate. (doorbell rings) Hey, big guy, ready to go? (Neil) Coach? Yeah. Where's everybody else? Well, it looks like it's just going to be you and me today, bud. Really? Yep. Cool. I picked "Blood Prom." It's an R-rated slasher flick... tons of cool gore and murders in it. When this one really annoying blonde chick got her head chopped off, I cheered. After the movie, we we picked up a pizza and headed back to Coach's. Coach's house was awesome! He had a giant TV, an Atari with Donkey Kong, Asteroids, Frogger. All my favorite games. (video game beeping) (laser blasts) - Ohh! - Ha, you exploded. My turn. (video game beeping) Sure your mom's not expecting you? Ah, she works. She's probably got a date with Alfred afterward. My guess is you spend a lot of time by yourself, huh? Yeah, but I kind of like it. I just ride my bike and watch TV. It's cool. (video game blooping) Oh, shit. You made me mess up! Sorry. Hold on. Come here for a sec. Oh, bring one of them bottles of Peach Nehi. (crickets chirping) Okay... this might seem a little weird at first, but I need to record my team's voices, especially my best players. Okay? Take this. Now just speak into it using your normal voice. Well, what should I say? (Coach) Whatever you like. Start with your name. Neil. Now take a big sip of pop... and belch. Uhh! Shit. (chuckles) Good. Say that again. Shit. Again. Shit, shit, shit. - Keep going. - (belches) Shit. (belches) Hell! Damn! Now, um, look up into the camera. Now stick your tongue out. (camera clicks and whirs) Make a... make a funny face. (laughing) Good, good. Yeah... yes, Neil, yes. Yes. (camera whirring) Open your mouth real wide. ♪♪ Neil, that's perfect. ♪♪ (Neil) July 2nd. We had a 7:30 game against Hutchinson Taco Hut. I know you're gonna kick their butts tonight. You gonna knock one out of the park for your poor, hard-working mom? So you're gonna get a ride home with Coach, right? - Yeah. - Mm-mwah. (zany cartoon noises on TV) (door opens and closes) (door opens) You're mine, and I love you, and don't you ever forget it. (grunts) (kiss) (door closes) Boy, were you on fire tonight. It's the best you ever played. Thanks, Coach. Hey, can we play some more of those game cartridges tonight? Sure, we can. But I gotta show you something first. ♪♪ (laughing) Ew... I look stupid in this one. No. You look perfect... your expression. Like you're having a wonderful dream. Neil... I've been thinking a lot about you this week. I'm hungry. Sure. You want a pizza? I might have something here you'd like. Whoa! What'll it be, little buddy? My mom never buys these things. She says they're a big waste of money. Let's eat then. (grunts) Which one do you want? I don't know, what are you having? Corn pops. Then I'll have, uh... Cocoa Krispies. (silverware clattering) Uhh! Shit. Sorry. (laughing) You do one. (laughing) Whoo, good one! Whoo! Here we go. (cereal crunching) I like you, Neil. I like you so much. When I really, really like someone... ...there's a way I show them how I feel. Shh. Angel. There's nothing wrong with kissing someone like this. Don't ever let anyone tell you that it's wrong. (Neil whimpering) (Neil) It happened. That's what I told myself. It just happened. And after it was over, I looked down at the mess on the floor. It was like a kaleidoscope had shattered. And when I swallowed, the taste of Coach's tongue seared my mouth. You liked it. It's okay that you liked it. Everything's gonna be okay. (wolf howling) (thunder sound effects) ♪♪ Do you know him or something? (Neil) I met Wendy Peterson when I was ten. She was 11, one grade ahead of me in school. What are you doing? Damn, no razor. You're insane. If I wasn't queer, we would have ended up having sloppy teenage sex and getting pregnant, contributing more fucked-up, unwanted kids to society. But instead, she became my soul mate. My... one true partner in crime. Let's kidnap him. His mom says we're supposed to take him home. (kids shouting indistinctly) Wh-where are you taking me? A house with lots and lots of candy. Goody. (haunted house sound effects) (woman) Beware... Beware... Bewaaaare. These are the eyes of the axe murderer's victims. Come on, Satan. Hurry up, chicken. Brian... (Brian) I never much cared for Halloween, but this particular year, I couldn't shake the feeling that something horrible was gonna happen. And there was nothing I could do to stop it. Wait outside for me. I'll be done in a minute. (indistinct chatter) All right, you hold him while I go get something. What are we gonna do? Have some fun.

Shut up... shut up, or we'll kill you. Point the beam over here. Open your mouth. I said open your mouth! Now, keep these in your fuckin' mouth.

Just lay still for a minute. You're my little green buddy, and there's this cool thing I wanna show you. When I was little, a man used to do this to me, and you're really gonna like it. There, that's it. That's my boy. Wendy never looked at me quite the same after that night. I mean... sharing this part of myself I'd never shown anyone else, ever before. And I knew we'd be bound together... forever. (Brian) I woke up... once again not knowing where I was or what had happened to me. By the time I made my way back, Deborah said I'd been missing for over an hour. But I couldn't remember a thing. All I knew was that it was somehow linked to the other time, the night I woke up in the cellar. And I also knew that, no matter how long it took, I had to find out what had happened to me. I had to find an answer to the mystery. When I was 15, I overheard some kids at school talking about a place. A place that you could find even in a dumbass hick town like Hutchinson. Bingo. Here we go. How's it going? Okay. I'm Charlie. Neil. Wanna go for a ride? Sure. You got cash? I'll pay 50, no higher. You gotta be careful out here. The cops patrol this whole entire area, and they got brains enough to know what's up. I'm in Hutchinson on business. I supply snack foods to the local markets. Go ahead. Take whatever you want. Hungry, huh? (door squeaks) (man) We've only got an hour. So we better get busy. Wait. Let me. Beautiful. So, uh, what do you like to do? Tell me what you want me to do. Whatever.

Plus... you're only a kid. (sighs) Boo. Maniac! You scared me. Thanks for meeting me. Yeah, well, this better be good. My mom will kill me if she finds out I snuck out this late. I have something I wanna show you. (door squeaks loudly) Ew. Look. Yeah, so? That's me. You're such a liar. I don't believe you. I'll prove it. (scoffs) Okay, how? Oh, my God, what are you...

Even Hutchinson has its share of freaks. You trick with the wrong guy, and I'd find pieces of you everywhere. Okay, "Mom." I wish there's a movie showing right now. Me too. A film about our lives.

The commercial showed this crazy old man claiming aliens beamed him right up out of his bathtub. (TV running indistinctly) If you're going to make fun, I'd just as soon watch it by myself. Shh, it's starting. (TV announcer) Tonight on "World Of Mystery," we investigate the terrifying world of UFOs. Is it mass hysteria or something all too real? They kept me prisoner for hours! They examined me like I was a... a frog in biology class. And then they stuck a probe in my stomach. I still got the scar here to prove it. Look at that. I always got scared anytime I watched movies about UFOs. Even "E.T." scared me. Poor thing. She looks so homely and sad. - Shh! - Avalyn Frisen lives in the tiny, ordinary town of Inman, Kansas. "Inman." That's only 30 miles away. 32 years old, she is unmarried, lives with her father, and works part-time as a secretary. But there is something unusual about Avalyn. For as long as she can remember, things have happened to her, things she cannot explain. I'd heard about people who've experienced missing time. Whole chunks of their lives they couldn't account for. Under hypnotic regression, I learned that I had been abducted more than 20 times. - Oh, please! - Quiet. The first time was when I was 6. I was on my way home from a picnic with my grandparents. It was dark, and we got lost driving down a dirt road. Grandpa lost control of the car, and we went into a ditch. There was this blinding white light. But the aliens weren't interested in my grandparents. They floated me up out of the car using some sort of gravitational ray. (shimmering sound effect) That's it... I've had enough. I'm gonna get some ice cream. - Want some? - No, thanks. I remember lying on a table. It was cold, smooth and shiny. The aliens surrounded me. They were bald, with huge, marshmallowy heads and tiny arms. But the worst part was their eyes. The only way I can describe them is big, black diamonds, all liquidy and jellyish.

Here, have a seat. Have you eaten? I was just in the middle of lunch, I hope you don't mind. No, go ahead. I ate earlier. So, you saw the show? Several times. I videotaped it.

You're at the point I was a few years ago, where you're just starting to remember things. There are many of us, and we all have this drive to know what happened. So... you think that's what happened to me? Just from what I told you about the missing time and... Oh, I'm sure of it. Feel like going on a walk? What's that you're carrying? It's a dream journal. I keep a log of all my dreams. Whatever bits and pieces I can recall, at least. I... I feel like it's slowly helping me remember. That's a really good idea.

Come here, I want to show you something they wouldn't allow on "World of Mystery." I've been tagged. Part of their experiments. Touch it. When I was taken, my leg was bleeding, but I didn't remember being cut, nothing. Then, under hypnosis is when I discovered that's where they implant the tracking device. Now everything I do, they know. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they were spying on us right now. When I was found that night, my nose was bleeding.

But, of course, I haven't told him much, i.e. about your "line of work." I did say you were queer like me, only because I figured you wouldn't care. But now, are you ready for the good part? He thinks that when you and him were little, you were both abducted and examined by space aliens. (laughing) How brilliant is that? But he was completely serious when he told me this.

When Eric wrote me about you, I... I could only get the vaguest, hazy picture in my head. Like a staticky TV. Same here. But seeing you here in this room... I feel like he's watching us right now. I have no idea what happened to him. After that summer, he just disappeared. I don't even know if he's alive or what. Maybe it's his ghost that's watching us. Tell me everything you can. (grunts) I was his favorite. Out of everyone, he picked me. I know that sounds kind of weird, but... when it first started happening... I felt honored. Go on. I don't know, well, this is where the big TV was, all the cool video games. That's the kitchen. Our first time happened there. It lasted that whole summer. Just me and him. I saw him one other time. On Halloween, a couple years later. I was lost. He said my name. (Coach) Brian? Brian? I thought that was you. The game had just started. I was sitting on the bench, as always. It started to rain. Sprinkles at first, then a downpour. The ump called the game. And no one came to pick you up. My mom was working and my Dad... Who knows? Everyone else drove off with their parents. I was left there all alone. And you were in the dugout with me, and you said... We'll take you home. And we got into Coach's station wagon, remember? (thunder rumbles) He brought us here. (door opens) It's all right, Brian. We're just going to have a little bit of fun. (Neil) And he didn't want you in the bedroom, because that was just for us. So it all happened here, in this room. Keep going. Don't stop until you've told me everything. Well, any time there was another boy involved, it was always the same. Coach used me as a prop to pull you in. (laughing) He'd take off my clothes, and it was up to me to make it seem like fun, like this was a really cool game we were playing. Go ahead, show him, Neil. All right, here are the rules. First I kiss you, then you kiss me back, and then it's his turn. Are you ready? Here we go. (whispers) My God. You want me to stop? So I put my tongue in your mouth, just getting it all wet and shiny. And then it was his turn. Watching his big lips sucking your face, I remember thinking, "Ah, he's going to swallow his head whole." So, um... we took off your clothes... and you made this... whimpering puppy sound Coach always loved. Coach and me had this thing... where he'd open up his mouth and... wrap it around my dick and balls and everything all at once. He did that to me and... then I tried to do it to you, but I couldn't 'cause my mouth was too small. And then... he went down on you. For what seemed like a really long time. Your eyes were closed mostly, but every now and then they'd flutter open, and... just have this glassy, faraway look. And then I leaned in and whispered... It's fun, right? Tell him you think it's fun. We're almost finished, you... You gonna be able to... (weakly) Yeah. Then we played the $5 game... when Coach would ask me to do things, crazy sex things, and... if I could do them, he'd give me a $5 bill. It's okay... go ahead, Neil. (grunting) He made us fist him. You know what that is? I went first, of course. And on that night, the $5 was mine... if I could... ram my little fist up his ass and wring it all the way to the elbow. And God damn it, I did it. I'll never forget how it felt. It felt like his whole body was trying to suck me into it. Devour me. And then I did it too. (sighs) And then, uh, we drove you back to Little River and left you in your driveway. The End. And my nose was bleeding. How did that happen? When it was over, and we were getting you dressed... your face looked like you'd been erased. Like you were just empty inside. And you just fell face first on the floor... bam. And when we pulled you up, your nose was bleeding. Like... like this? (panting) Like this?! Shh, shh, shh. Stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop. Shh, shh, shh. (sobbing) (shuddering) Shh... (boy) What are you doing? Nobody's even home. (second boy) No, someone's there. Shh... shh, shh. (boy) Look, I see them too. (woman) Children, what's going on? (boy) I think that someone's in there.

But that was a lie. Plus, I couldn't speak anyway. I wish there was some way for us to go back and undo the past. But there wasn't. There was nothing we could do. So I just stayed silent... and trying to telepathically communicate how sorry I was about what had happened. And I thought of all the grief and sadness and fucked-up suffering in the world, and... it made me want to escape. I wished with all my heart that we could just leave this world behind... rise like two angels in the night and magically... disappear. ♪♪
