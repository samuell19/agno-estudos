I’m going! Is everything all right? - Yes, thank you. - OK. Excuse me, could I have a glass of water? Sure. You didn’t want to come. I was just calling you to ask if you can take the night shift.

Everything is fine. - Are you sure? - Yes, I am sure. Always so mysterious. It’s been ringing for a while. Thank you. I'll be back. - Hello? - Hello. I’m Sonia. The wife of.. I mean.. The ex-wifr of Orlando. Yes. I know. How are you? There’s no need for the formality. Look, I talked to Gabo, and he told me that you’re living in Orlando’s apartment. Is that true? Yes, it’s true. Well, I’ll be needing his car. Of course. - You could have left the car with Gabo. - He didn't want to. Look ma'am... Look. Tell me when you need it, and I can drop it off. Let’s see.. Tomorrow. Could you drop it off at my office tomorrow? I’ll text you the address, and... You can leave it in the parking lot. You can ask there to know where to park it. OK. At 10:30? Is that time OK? I’ll work it out. Anything else of his that you might have? No. Just the intimate things. Well, we’ll have to work out what to do about the apartment. Of course. I’d like for you to handle all practical affairs with me, okay? All right. Could we talk about that when we meet? I'm working right now. - Will you bring us our check, or not? - Right now. .I'll come back. Marina, someone’s looking for you outside. - Who? - I Don’t know. - Where? - At the entrance. Good afternoon, Marina. Thank you for coming out, this is just going to take two minutes. - Hello. - Hello. I’m Detective Adriana Cortes, from the Investigations Police’s Sexual Offenses Unit. Good afternoon. Well, first of all, I wanted to offer you my condolences, They told me what happened, and I’m really sorry. The fact that you run away from the hospital, gave me some reason for concern. - Could we talk over there? - Sure. - If you please.. - Of course. I didn’t run away. Oh. There must have been some confusion, then. Could I see your identification, please? One question.. Mr. Orlando... Onetto. Exactly. Was he paying you? We were a couple. So you cared for each other. It wasn’t just sexual, right? It was a normal consensual relationship.. between two adults. Why do you want to know that? Because he was old enough to be your dad. Did you use drugs before his attack? No. Alcohol? Yes. Did you have sex? I don’t remember. I need to know if he suffered any kind of physical stress. Nothing unusual The thing is, Mr. Onetto’s body.. Arrived with injuries, with bruises. He had injuries on his arms, on his sides, on his neck. And a contusion to his head. These injuries are recent. I talked to the doctor about all of this. Did you talk to his family? Marina! Excuse me. We’re having problems with the check for table 15. I’m coming. I'm coming right now. Five minutes, please. - Can’t anyone fill in for you? - No! And I really need to get back to work. Because.. they’ll fire me. Look, I’ve been working on the streets for 23 years 14 years on the Sexual Offenses Unit. I have a Master’s degree on the subject. I know very well what happens with people, Sorry, with women like you. Because I’ve seen it all. All. I want you to know that I understand and support you. Did you have to defend yourself from him? - Am I being arrested? - No! - Then I’m leaving, because I really... - No, wait, let’s do something. Call me when you’re done here so we can talk properly. So that I can sleep tonight, okay? Talk about what? I’ll be waiting for your call. And it’s best if you don’t leave Santiago. - Okay, goodbye. - Goodbye, Marina. -Thank you, the place looks great! - Thanks. - Is every thing OK? - Yes. Everything is OK. - I tried to rescue you, did you notice? - Yes, I noticed, thank you. Are'nt you going to tell me what the fuck is going on? Can it be some another time? I've had a terrible day. No problem. Diabla! Hi to you. Marina. This is Detective Cortes speaking. I imagine you must have a good reason for standing up an Investigations officer. Now, I’m not going to ask, I’m going to DEMAND, that you come in and talk to me tomorrow. I’ll be at the Forensic Medical Service, Look for me when you get there I’ll see you at 12:30. Don’t call me. No excuses. I’m not interested. And please don’t make me send someone to pick you up. Diabla! Come here. Come here. Are you Marisa? Marina. I’m Bruno. I’m sorry. I thought there was no one here. What happened, Marisa? Your dad suddenly started feeling sick. Everything happened really fast. What were you doing? Sleeping. And that’s all? You were with him and, he died? Just like that? We ran to the hospital. His body was bruised. Why the fuck was his body bruised? An injury to his head. He felt down the stairs when we were going down. That’s why. What about those suitcases? I was moving in. Bitch! What are we going to do with you, Diabla? Orlando gave her to me. I’m sorry. He gave you Diabla? That really sucks. Look.. I slept with this dog.. for years. But I had to stop doing it. I didn’t like the smell. Did you know that there are two kinds of people with pets? Those who have mammals, and those who prefer birds or reptiles. Mammals, we have a neocortex. The most developed layer of neural tissue. Where emotions are generated. The same place which genertaed empathy, tenderness.. And love. I don’t see anyone with a lizard around here. I don't get you analysis. - Or are you trying to say something else? - I´m not trying to say anything. Have you gotten the operation? You can’t ask me that. And why not? I don`t understand what are you! I’m the same as you. Yeah, sure... Can we talk some other time? I really... Wait, wait... I just need to know when you’re moving out of this apartment. I’ll let you know as soon as I find something. - How much time are we talking about? - A few weeks. No, not a few weeks. No! Give me an exact date or I’ll kick you out. You know what? Go away from my house. This isn’t your house! Incredible! My dad was crazy! If you steal anything, I’ll know. Hey Bruno! My name is Marina. Bye. Miss? Hey, Miss? I need to pay for the wash. What you need is a cup of coffee. Ok, one expresso. How would you like it? Double. Fool! - Hi, good morning. - Hi, good morning. I’m bringing this car to Sonia... - I don`t know her last name. - Yes, Sonia Bunster. She told me to inform her about your arriving. Please park in the -4th floor, parking space number 5. She’ll come and pick up the car. She wants me to wait down there? Yes, that’s what she told me. - Thank you. - You’re welcome, go ahead. Hello. Hello, Sonia. I’m sorry. - Hello. - Hello. I've been wondering how is your face for about a year. It's different like this, face to face. Of course. As you can see... Bones and flesh. It’s just that... I can’t imagine Orlando being with you. That’s all. Sorry. Understood. OK.. Don't treat me so formal. - Here are the car keys. - Thank you. The documents are in the glove compartment. - Excuse me. - Yes. Complicated. Pure complicated. Pure quantum physics. I don’t want to talk about the apartment right now. Just move out as quickly as possible. OK? Okay. Thank you. Sonia, I’m so sorry about how things turned out. What are you sorry for? For the whole soap opera, or for this episode in particular? For the way in which things happened. Yes, clearly.. You know, when I married Orlando... I was 38 years old. We were a completely normal couple. Completely.. And we had a normal life... So when he came.. And explained to me... I.. So then I thought that.. I’m sorry if it sounds crude and direct of me to say this, but the thing is. I really think that this is... just perversion. I’m sorry, but... When I look you I don't know.. I don’t know what I’m looking at. A chimera, that’s what I see. A chimera? OK! I’m sorry. There’s no need to be sorry. You’re normal. You’re fine. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi Sonia. - Hi Pablo. How are you? Im fine, and you? Fine. Thanks. Good. Thank you. Do you know that my 7 year old daughter will be at the wake this afternoon? Yes. And I would love to know where it’s being held. I know how to be discreet. But don’t even think about going. I have the right to say goodbye to him, too. Look, it’s my problem now. You already went through a hard time. Now all the paperwork is up to me. And in fact, I’d like to compensate you for everything that you’ve done. So that you can be at ease. You don’t need to go anywhere, or do anything else And we’re going to handle this in a civilized way, so we can both be satisfied. I don’t need your money, ma’am. Did you call Investigations Police? No. Well, in any case, I apologize. I’m just looking out for my love ones. That’s all. Orlando was a loved one to me. Yes, but you aren't coming to the funeral, or even the wake. Do you understand? I don't know how to explain it to you. What you want me to say? Daniel! You are not going to the funeral.. Or any place. Please... Let us live this mourning as a family. As it’s supposed to be. Do not show up. I’m asking you as a mother. Just think that there’s an entire family, devastated. In shock. I would give a lung for my daughter, if this is needed. Adriana, I wanted to apologize for not calling... Detective Cortes. Detective. I wanted to apologize for not calling you last night, but I was overwhelmed. I took some sleeping pills... It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. - This way. - Yes. - This way, please. - Yes. Are we going to see Orlando’s body? No. I asked for a room and if I'm late, I'll be in trouble. What do you need? The thing is, since you didn't call me yesterday.. I went over our conversation. The toxicology exam came back with positive results for alcohol... and marihuana. Where are we going? We’re giving you a physical inspection. No. No way. Don’t worry, it's just 5 minutes. It’s all superficial. Go ahead. - Please. - But you never told me.. Look, Marina. I went to check on you yesterday, I was worried. I gave you an opportunity to tell the truth and call, but lied to me. Then, you failed to keep your promise and left me waiting like crazy. Again, I apologize for not calling you yesterday. That sleeping pill... I’m sorry. About that other thing... - But marihuana... - Look, what I need is, to confirm that you don't have any injures. - But I don’t have any injures. - Then there shouldn’t be a problem. What? Why are you doing this to me? Because it's what corresponds. It’s called a "Possible injuries observation". Well, I refuse. Fine! I’ll file for a formal request from the district attorney, and that implies opening a file on Mr. Onetto’s death. Look, if you don't have anything, this ends here. You go on with your life. You decide. I'm going to close this. So you'll be comfortable. Go on. Thank you for your help. You saved me. We’re even now, right? You told me her name was Daniel? What should I call her? Don’t call her Daniel. Treat her like a woman. - What should I say? - Call her by her woman's name. What did she do? I don't know, that's why we are here. But is she involved in something complicated? OK. This way, please. - What’s your name? - Marina. That’s a pretty name, Marina. Could you stand there, please? Thank you. let's start. Marina, right? Marina. Just, if you, please.. Could you... Could you uncover your chest? OK. This will be really quick, OK? Here I go. That’s it. Now please raise your right arm. A little higher. Yes. There. The same with the other arm, please. Like this, Marina. Very good. Have you received any kind of aggression... Blows, have you fallen, anything like that? No. Are you sure? Yes. OK. Well, now I’m going to ask you to uncover your lower part, please. Could you please leave us do that...? No! I’m sorry. Could you uncover your lower half? We’re almost done, Marina. Could you please raise your right leg, Marina? To the side? There. Hello, Marina. This is Gabo. I'm sorry to bother you. Look... We’re going to incinerate Orlando. It’s what he wanted And although Sonia doesn't know yet... To be clear, this is my own initiative. - I wanted to offer you... - OK? Some of his ashes. Thank you, but no. It's just that I feel that you deserve them. Really. In exchange for not showing up, Gabo? I’d love for you to come. - But... - I'm eating right now Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't want to interrupt you. Gabo, I’m hanging up. Hold on a second, we haven’t agreed on... Thank you for seeing me. Come in. Fucking gout. I can't believe that even your illnesses are corny. You look awful. You’re not wearing your glasses. You can't see me from there. You look... Awful! Did you come here to improve your technique, or.. To hide from the world for a while? Both. And vice-versa. Look, I have no problem with you coming here too little or too late.. Or whenever you need a little moral support. But I’m your coach.. For singing. Lyrical. Not salsa, or Merengue Lyrical singing. And you’re not my psychologist, And you’re not my father. No. What did I come for, you think? To sing, I hope. To look for some love, maybe? Love isn't something you search for. No. Not Saint Francis again, please. Saint Francis doesn’t say: “Give me love, give me peace, give me light, give me this, give me that.” Saint Francis says, “Make me an instrument of your love, make me a channel of your peace.” Won't you sing a little bit for me now? Diabla! Diabla? Diabla! Onetto Textiles. Good afternoon. I have a wreath for Orlando Onetto. Could you please tell me where the wake is being held? Take it easy, pretty. Is this all you’re stealing? If you had a bigger car, I could steal more. What? You two sisters are starting already? You’ll scare me to death. No. I’ll survive. I think we should call the police. right? What for? Because it’s a crime. Strictly speaking, it’s trespassing. No, I don't want any more police... no more hospital, no more gowns, no more uniforms. Nothing. It was Orlando’s son. He wants me out of there fast. That's all. That’s not the point. It’s no way to communicate, right? Oh please, Mr. Contradictions! “That's not the point”. Stay out of it! What do you mean, stay out of it? Why you call that Contradictions? I’m getting out of your house as soon as I can, OK? No, it’s not that. Our house is your house, always. Always, right? Yes, always. - Can I ask you for one last favor? - Another one? - Cut it out. - What? Stop it! - Could you drop me off here, please? - What do you want to do? - I want my dog. - What for? I don't think it’s a good idea for you to do anything by yourself. No. Let’s wait until we get home. There, we can smoke something. We can relax, and then you can make a more mature decision. OK. Marina! Marina! - Climb out! - Why don't you climb out?! - Because I'm driving. - Yes, sure... NO ONE HERE SAYS ANYTHING! Leave, please! Mom! Don't you have any respect for other people pain? Get out of here! Out! Marina! Marina! Marina, I apologize. Sorry, I beg your pardon. Everyone is a little upset. It’s nothing personal. Sorry. Saying goodbye to a loved one when he dies, is a basic human right. Right. Right. I think you’re completely right. It’s done, Gabo. Go back inside. Make sure you don’t fall. Why did you come to disturb the family?! You were told over and over again to leave us alone. What do you want? We want you to get out of here, you fucking faggot. - What are you looking at? - You’re looking at me. - Are you threatening me faggot? - No. Go destroy families somewhere else. You fucking monster! You Fucking faggot. Stop the car! Stop! Let go of me, you coward! Let go of me! What do you want? You drive. - What do you want?! - You're a piece of shit! Where are you taking me? - Where are you taking me? - Shut up! Where is my dog? Shut up! What did you do to my dog, you coward? That's not your house. If you liked my dress so much, take it, asshole. You use dresses, right? Did you cut off your dick and put it away? Close your snout, it smells like shit! - You think you’re Julia Roberts, you shit? - A dress with those football player legs? You have no right to touch me! Do you think your dad would be proud of what you’re doing to me? He would slap you if he saw you! You shouldn't have sent the police! Let go of me! Let go of me! What? I can't hear you! - Now talk, you motherfucker! - Talk! You faggot! Talk! You piece of shit! I hope it`s clear now! Hello, Marina. Hello, Gaston. Here it is. Orlando Onetto Pertier. What does it say?
