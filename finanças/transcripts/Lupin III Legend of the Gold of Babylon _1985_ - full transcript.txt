How many miles to Babylon? Three score miles and ten... Can I get there by candle-light? Yes... and back again. Oooh, wow! Wow, everyone's so good-looking! Wonderful! C... cut it out! Knock it off! C... calm down, chin. 0... 0k, Willy. Gentlemen, what are your favorite monsters? I hate monsters. But it's customary to wear monster masks at this club. How about these? I think they'd suit you, myself. What the hell are you talking about, you moron? We're already wearing masks! Oh? What are those monsters called? Jigen and goemon... one's a monster with a 0.3-second fast-draw. Where's lupin? Tell us! Gee, I dunno. Don't blow it, hear? Me kill lupin. Oh, if it isn't the boss man! Do you remember me? Hey, if it ain't old lady rosetta! I remember you, I remember you. Still clinging to life, I see. I'll worry about your funeral arrangements, so drink up! Oh, I'm so happy! Thank you, boss man! This is great! Well, this interpol bastard, zenigata, chases me all over the place. But you see, he's a bumbling, blockheaded nincompoop... And such a big bungler that even his intestinal bacteria are twisted! Excuse us! Mr. lupin, we have a special delivery from Tokyo! Ah! Over here, over here! L... it's lupin! Maybe it's a love present from fujiko... Heh heh! So sorry, lupin! It is, unexpectedly, zenigata, he of the twisted intestinal bacteria! Bungling, blockheaded nincompoop zenigata! Well? Are you impressed? Oh, did you hear that? Sorree! It just so happens I had my ears cleaned at the barbershop yesterday. I didn't know! I didn't know! Please! Please! More! More! More! Dammit! Hey, what're you doing? Knock it off! Knock it off or you're under arrest! Pops, those cymbals really suit you. Enough to make me want to give you a kiss. Oh! Then why don't you kiss me? I swear, I can't just keep hanging around here with you. Well, bye-bye! Hold it! Running away is cowardly! Huh?! Hold it, lupin! Damn! We're doomed! Run! Run! Hmm? Once again, you've cut worthless- don't say it. Peek-a-boo! Now then, on whom will the goddess of victory smile? The great thief lupin, or inspector zenigata of interpol? It's the start of the Broadway grand prix race! Betting odds are 100:1. Make that 1000:1! You bastard! Pardon me! Thank you, thank you, oh, thank you! Thank you, thank you, oh, thank you! Why is that long-armed ape still alive? Shouldn't he be long since dead, Kowalski? There was probably a hitch. Don't worry, junior. I'll see to it he's taken care of before the morning. How? Would you prefer that I float or sink him in the Hudson river? Float him... I think I'll drink a toast with my girlfriend as we look over the river. Ok, I'll float him right at noon. "I bet on lupin. If he loses, we're through!” "I bet on lupin. If he loses, we're through!” "I bet on lupin. If he loses, we're through!” I've never seen a longshot like this! "I bet on lupin. If he loses, we're through!” - naturally! Lupin's got it in the bag! - Nobody's gonna bet on zenigata! - Naturally! Lupin's got it in the bag! - Nobody's gonna bet on zenigata! That's right! Lupin, hang in there... please! Yo, fujicakes! I'll be right there! Gonna die, gonna die! Gonna die! Oh, I know! What? What the...? Stare...! Hey! Lupin, hold it! Hold it! Damn you, lupin! I'll get you! Next time we meet, for sure, for sure...! Oh, it was nothing, it was nothing! I hear you. Half of the take goes to marciano, right? Sam, let this thing handle the money-counting. Wow! I got that much-huh?! "So, sora, sora, sora, a dance of bills..." "Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, tra-la-la..." Why youl! You let him take it from you?! You see this, Mike? This is no ordinary flyswatter. Listen up, Willy. Uh, yes, sir! This goes for any man who is a member of the New York mafia: The first time he sees this, he'll turn a bashful red... The second time he sees this, he'll turn a terrified white... The third time he sees this, he'll turn purple...! And that will be his end. It's that kind of implement. That's right, it's a flyswatter of death! If you understand, then turn around! Ok! Close your eyes! Grit your teeth! Why you- idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Ro... ro... ro...! Ro... ro... rosetta's... huh?! It... it's a ghost! Nope, still got my human legs right 'ere where they belong. Look. Huh? I've been helping myself. Ok, rosetta, you can have that bourbon. Now beat it, beat it, beat it! No can do. I'm a firm believer in paying back today's debts today. Huh? Hey, old lady, what're you thinking? What do you think of my dance, lupin? I may not look it, but long ago I danced all over the world! That's ok! Stop it, rosetta! You've paid me back plenty. What a barbarian you are. It's not with my dancing that I thought to pay you back. What? Now, lupin, take me! How cute you are, lupin! Wh... who asked you?! I'll tell you something wonderful. Th... th... that's all right! Once upon a time, in the fifth century b.C, Babylon, the capital of the up-to-then thriving mesopotamian civilization is said to have been destroyed by the advancing great army of persia. However, it is also said that just before Babylon was destroyed, a god appeared, gathered up all the gold in Babylon, and hid it away. Oh? So? And? That god called the treasure "the wealth of Babylon," and in this candelabra- Huh? He's still there! So you came around, huh, you New York mafia cockroaches! Rosetta! Put me down! Put me down! = no! No! No! No! I'll do him in, chin. No. Me kill lupin. All right, move it, old lady! Lupin, we'll die together! No way! No way! Lead bullets don't get through to me. I accept balls of gold er, I mean, bullets of gold, or diamond bullets, maybe. Now stick 'em up. Finished? No, not yet. Can't just let 'em go, now can I? Right, old lady? How many miles to Babylon? Three score miles and ten. Can I get there by candle-light? Yes, and back again. If your heels are nimble and light, you may get there by candle-light. That old lady moves fast when she has to... okay, form a single line! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Stupid lupin! Stupid lupin! "We cannot stand losing! A coin for a flower!" What the hell's that? A souvenir left behind by old lady rosetta. This could be one hellacious item. That old woman seems to know that I'm trying to get close to marciano and the secret of Babylon. Who the hell is she? Hmmm... A "luxury beggar"! What're you painting, marciano? I thought of painting a long-armed ape, but I've moved on to something else. I had an incredible dream last night, you see. Oh, now it's a statue of a golden lion? The other day it was a golden coffin, right? You do a lot of dreaming, don't you? But I wonder if the wealth of Babylon is really there. It is. Do you not believe what I say? It's always just talk. Sooner or later I'd like you to show me some action. How's that for an engagement ring, fujiko? Don't misunderstand me, marciano. I thought I said I'd give you my love after you found the gold of Babylon. I'll find the gold of Babylon any time now. My organization is making an all-out search effort, after all. I'm not just doing this on a whim. It's an enterprise dating back to my father's time. I'm tired of hearing that. I think I'll go back to Tokyo soon. Fujiko... Come on out. I'll show you some action. Okay. But hang on a sec. Open sesame. My father gave control of his territory to lucky Luciano, but not because he got fed up with the family business. It was because the search for the gold of Babylon entranced him. It all started when Clay tablets were found at a subway construction site... Under Madison square garden. What were Clay tablets inscribed with babylonian cuneiforms doing buried deep under New York? To this day, it remains an unsolvable mystery, but from that moment... My father completely washed his hands of the business of organized crime... And threw himself into excavating the ruins of Babylon. Unfortunately, at the exact same time... Hitler sent a large archaeological investigation unit to Iraq. Hitler was searching for the same thing as my father. Gold! A golden object, said to have been created by order of... King nebuchadnezzar, out of the gold gathered from all over babylonia. An object?! I don't know what form it takes, but there is no doubt that it is gold. The Clay tablets that my father found were thus inscribed. And so I decided to carry on my father's enterprise... Leaving his organization in the hands of Kowalski, a young boss. Oh, it's wonderful! Close sesame. Well done, fujiko. You didn't even spare a glance for the rest of the trash. So these are the famous Manhattan inscriptions? Yeah, that's right. It's said that in all, 50 Clay tablets have been found in Manhattan... Of those, 40 are here. What?! Hey, this is odd. Aren't cuneiforms supposed to be gouged inward? These are projecting outward. I wonder if they could be inverse characters? Can you read them? Not hardly. Are all inverse characters. I knew it... just as lupin said it was. What? Lupin has gathered several tablets similar to these. Not as many as this, though. It can't be. So you're saying that he's after the same thing? Oh, didn't you know? He's thoroughly investigated the gold of Babylon plus your father, and knows all about them. And you too, of course. I'll kill him! I'll kill him! That long-armed ape! That petty thief! "Petty thief?" That's no way to talk. I wonder what lupin would say if he heard that. A concealed camera, huh?! Have you been sneaking photos?! Eek! Pervert! How nasty! What are you going to do to me?! L... lupin. You can't escape this place. Don't you worry. Just go to sleep. I've got your voice recorded right here. "Open sesame.” I'll take the treasure of Babylon. Nighty-night. This new job? I'll give it my all! What do you think of modern female university students? They're just sooo cute! What foods don't you like? Octopus... oh, yeah, I'm thinking of going to Paris for escargot. How about a word for inspector zenigata? Commissioner, please assign me a team for the sole purpose of arresting lupin! What foods don't you like? Octopus... oh, yeah, I'm thinking of going to Paris for escargot. How about a word for inspector zenigata? Neener-neener! Why, you, lupin! Neener-neener! - Neener-neener! Neener-neener! - How you dare you make fun of me! - Neener-neener! Neener-neener! - Why you! Why you! Zenigata! Yes, sir? As of today, I am removing you from the lupin detail. No! Commissioner, you can't do that! Y... your new orders... Non, non, non! Commissioner! I, zenigata, work only on the lupin case, nothing else! "Non, non, non!" If you complain about it, you'll be discharged! Ladies and gentlemen passing by, please pardon the disturbance. This is an icpo publicity balloon. From Alaska in the north to new Guinea in the south... Fifty policewomen, representing the police forces of all the world's nations... Will compete in the miss icpo international policewomen beauty contest. Don't miss it! Entry no. 9: From the U.S., miss caramel! I love you! Entry no. 11: From China, miss chinjao! Nihao. Nihao. Nihao. Nihao. Chinjao. Entry no. 35: From the u.S.S.R, , miss zakskayal! Harasho! Harasho! Harasho! Harasho! Harasho, now scram... Entry no. 41: From Kenya, miss saranda! Ha, hoo, hoo, Kenya, ha, Kenya, ha, hoo, Kenya, ha! And now, the winner. Entry no. 26: From Italy, miss lasagna! How did that ugly pig get chosen?! The judging process is extremely fishy! Suspicions remain! Hold the contest over again! Well? Come on, answer us! Man! What a situation! Why would the icpo, premier in the world, put on a time-waster like this?! Ha! Dammit! Zenigata! Commissioner, what's wrong? L... I... I'm reassigning you to the lupin detail! Wha? L... is that true, sir? Commissioner, I... live to arrest lupin...! Zenigata, in addition, I want you to take some things. As of today, I assign these subordinates to you. And lasagna too. Just you wait, lupin! This time I'll throw you in the slammer! And now, what you've all been waiting for. The translation of the Manhattan inscriptions is... "A god... ordered, gather all the gold of the country..." "Built a... its location is to the south of Babylon... cupid." A place with all the country's gold has me piqued. It'll probably mass tens of thousands of tons, huh? Sorry, lupin. I make it a point not to believe stories with gods in them. I don't believe that stuff either. This stuff about a "god" is definitely just something the king made up to mask his own activities. Even if I believe in the treasure of Babylon... I don't accept where the writings were found. Why are they in America now? What business do they have being in the earth of New York? That's the one discordant note of this whole story... The hidden treasure chest, wouldn't you agree? Count me out. Hey, wait, goemon! I'll open this box for sure, you'll see! Hey, jigen! This is a huge treasure, which Alexander the great is said to have searched for in antiquity! More recently, Napoleon, and Hitler! Men who plotted world conquest have been obsessed with this treasure. And you want me to just give it to those lowlife gangsters?! Chill out, lupin. You're chickening out, aren't you, jigen?! Nobody said I'm not in. We're just out of cognac. Cognac? You can go con a yak for all I care! The circumstances under which the Clay tablets were found... What the...? Lupin, I love you. E... excuse me, but what do you mean by "love?" Is it kissing? If so, then spare me! Oh, Alex kissed me 100 times in a single day. Huh? Who's "Alex?" Alexander! Leo was also in love with me. He was always getting fresh. Which is why he didn't get enough sleep, and kept falling off his horse. Huh? When was this, old lady? At the battle of Waterloo, of course! That was when it happened. What?! Then, "Leo" is napo... Napo... Napoleon?! Yes, yes. Napoleon. He was a cute one. This is hopeless. I can't make heads or tails of what she's on about. South of Babylon... Got it! Enough, enough! Stop it, please! Oh, there it is! I was wondering where it had got to. What a shock! Oopsie-Daisy! Every 76 years... Stand atop the tower of babel. Hey, old lady. What the hell connection does the comet on that candelabra have to the treasure of Babylon? God rides in a comet... To come see the gold of Babylon. So what about you? Are you supposed to be god's guide along the way? Lupin, you're going to Babylon, right? You should remember, dark holes await you... dark holes. Lupin... I love you! S... s... stop it, already! I mean it. I love you, lupin. All right, all right. Platonically, right? Oh! Stop being mean to me! How many miles to Babylon? Three score miles and ten. Can I get there by candle-light? Yes, and back again. How many miles to Babylon? Three score miles and ten... That old woman's lived 2,500 years? Her?! Ludicrous. Jigen, drop your gun! If you show me the way to lupin's hideout, I'll let you live. That you, Kowalski? How do you plan to get to Babylon? The way the song says. Heh! You mean by candle-light?! Precisely! After him! Hey you! Cockroaches! Can you get there by candle-light? Yes, and back again. All right, Kowalski! Light your candle! Jigen, I'll leave nothing of you but bones! What do you say we get going, jigen? Goemon! Are you coming or aren't you? Secret technique: The lightning cut! You two are really impressive. Ok, get in, goemon. There's work to do. Terrine of foie gras and veal steak-so extravagant. For the wine, a '59 Bordeaux, n'est-ce pas? Very good, sir. Terrine of foie gras, huh? That'll be plenty, what with the vegetable sauté! Me kill lupin. Always prepared, huh, chin? Me kill lupin! People's thoughts aren't all that different, huh? Somebody slap the cuffs on these two. Are you telling us to put them in handcuffs, inspector? Right. These handcuffs are for lupin! Four or five in the front cars. Same in the aft passenger cars. One of them is... Here is our wine list. "Independent actions are prohibited. Attract them. Fascinate them first!" I'll have this. Me too. Very good, ladies. My my my! Oh, oh, a pair of my kind of big-busted ladies! Might I join you? Yes, come on. "Come on!" Don't mind if I do! It's a special sleeping drug. Looks like they're here. Lupin, let's switch seats-huh?! Sleep, lupin. Deeply. Like a sea cucumber. What the?! What the hell?! This dress is ruined! Nyet harasho! Hands up, lupin! I'm officer saranda of icpo. You're under arrest! What's going on? You bastard! How dare you, a thief, lay hands on a policewoman! Huh? Oh, no no no, you've got it wrong! Shut up! Surrender quietly! Wouldn't it be better if you evacuate the passengers instead? - What?! - Later! Hold it, lupin! Huh? Imprudence. Um... I'm chinjao. My name is goemon. Excuse me! Okay, hold it lupin! Hey, pops! Now you won't get away! Lupin! - Whoopsie! - Come back here! Why youl! Hold it, lupin! I swear, they don't know when to quit! Huh?! Who the hell are you?! Lupin, you're under arrest! You really do hang in there, don't you? Damn you- until I catch you I'll- Coochie coochie coo! So long, pops! Damn! Lupin, don't think you've escaped me! What's wrong, goemon? I won't forget. You're like a large flower. You're in love, aren'tcha, goemon? Now I get it in the gut! There's an Italian archaeological team digging directly south of... The ruins of Babylon, right? The leader is Dr. tartini. Am I right? Yes you are. He worked for the marciano foundation until Iraq's sultanate was overthrown. Or, to put it simply, he's a graverobber. So? Has this tartini expedition dug anything up? Yeah, just ten days ago. The tower of babel. What! The tower of babel? Oh come on. The tower of babel was dug up a long time ago. In the babylonian temple remains, they found Clay tablets with inscriptions identical to those in the old testament... So it came to be accepted that that was the tower of babel, right? However, it seems that one was the second tower, and that this one is older and much more historic, or so tartini says. Hmm... could marciano have already dug up the treasure? Didn't you say it would be tens of thousands of tons? How would one move something that heavy? Knowing him, he'll take it even if he has to mobilize the army. Wow, that's really something! I had no idea it was as big as this. There ain't no second tower. You're right. That round area couldn't be the top of the tower, now, could it? Well, in any case, the treasure is buried in that area. Huh? Here he comes, here he comes! It's marciano's entrance! Marciano is footing the entire bill for this investigative team. Ah, welcome. Hey tartini. Ok then. We do it after it gets dark, yeah? By the way, goemon, how do I use this rucksack? Stop stop stop stop stop! This is a terrible welcome mat. Praise god! Praise god! I remember now, old lady rosetta. A "score," if memory serves, means a "gouge" or "pit," right? Which means there's only one more pit! Alright! Fast, delicious, liliightweight! How about that? Just like I figured! Rosetta? Are you in there? Auditory hallucinations. Lupin... I've been waiting for you. I'm rosetta. Long ago... I was dispatched by god... And descended to earth. If that god comes from the sky every 76 years... Is his vessel, by any chance, a comet? Yes, lupin. I've been sleeping here all this time. Every 76 years I awaken, wander the earth... And search for the gold of Babylon. That's strange. This thing you call god doesn't even know where the treasure is? He doesn't. He doesn't know! Don't cry, rosetta of old... Get a grip on yourself! Hiding the secret of the gold of Babylon in a mother goose rhyme... The babylonians did some stylish things. The gold of Babylon! This is it! Okay, come on! Hang on tight! Okay, let's go! Dead end! Dead end! Success! This is too much hard work. So you found it at last! This is the gold of Babylon?! I thank you on behalf of my late father. Your task is completely finished. Get away from there! This... this is it, the treasure of Babylon that I've seen in my dreams! You said you'd accept gold or diamond bullets, right, mister lupin? Look! I went to a lot of trouble to order this. Lupin die! Me kill! Well, I dunno about that. One side! Shoot! Shoot! It's a kite! He's riding a kite! After him! "It's a kite!" "We cannot stand losing! A coin for a flower!" Catch me if you can! Morons! For something built from all the gold in the country... It's a little on the small side, you know? But oh well, I guess. When I get over there, it'll be huge. Ladies and gentlemen, over there is the river tigris. And over here, the river euphrates. It was here that mankind's first civilization was born. Going back some 5000 years or more. Wow! Something strange is coming up at me! Who-who-who-who...?! Who's the jerk who'd do something so nasty?! It must be you, fujiko. How are you going to move it? Where do you plan to take it to? You leave that to me. Why don't we take it to this country's president? I'm sure he'd give us lots of money. And then I could buy lots of wine again. If we did that, we'd be arrested for sure! Oh? Why? Look, you just leave this to me. Don't you think we should move into action sometime soon? We're not gonna be able to catch lupin serving under a man this incompetent. Right! Whatever he does, he's a bumbling, block-headed nincompoop. And he farts every now and then, too. I can't stand it anymore. Vehicles coming up! Get them to share some oil and water with us! In a polite way, that is. Oh, we'll handle it. Harasho! Hey! What do you think you're doing? Uh, no, you mustn't think we're challenging the Kuwaiti army or anything like that. You can walk home! Hey! Just a passing fancy, I guess. Excuse us. Hey! Hey! Give me the lion statue! If you resist, you will die! You bastard! Eat that! What the?! Whoa. Hey, stop it! Stop it! Knock it off! Whoa. Watch out, lupin! Wh... what the?! Looks like the Kuwaiti army's joining in. Though I can't imagine why. I will make them settle up. Charge into them. Okay, you're on! Okay, go! You botched it, huh, goemon? No, not at all. Wow, that was too close, goemon. You're terrific. How'd you know she was in there? I cannot cut flowers with zantetsuken. I guess this is what they call "mysteries of the orient." Hey lupin! Give yourself up quietly! I won't shoot! I promise I won't shoot! So pull that Jeep over right-! Hey, officer zakskayal! Don't shoot! Don't, I said! Hey, wh... wh... What're you doing? Knock it off! Has his throat been torn out? Has his head been twisted off? Or have his ribs been broken? You be quiet! Come on! There there there! Out of my way! Sights aligned. Fire! Up 'n... over... So sorry, pops. This is amphibious! Oh yeah? So's this! Tanks in general are... Damn you, lupin! What an idiot... Oh, uh, I thought it might hit them by chance. What's this? We mustn't despair! Faith! We must have faith! Dammit! Sink! Sink, you hear? Sink! I'm sinking! Goemon, come back! Lupin! Grr! Hey, fujiko, get away from him! Don't you wrap yourself around him! She's hit on some big-time Kuwaiti millionaire. Looks like she plans to travel the world... On a cruise ship, and get the treasure off her hands. Well, something like that, I guess. Aren't you annoyed, lupin? Not in the least! Fujiko, I'm sure, will no doubt stick her nose into our next big job. Hm...? Our next big job? Yeah, the continuation of this affair. The treasure of Babylon couldn't be something so small as that! There's a much, much bigger one. What?! It finally came to me in a big flash where it is. Hmm... where? - New York. - What did you say?! Wh... what the?! Fujiko, how's about you fulfill your promise? Promise? What is it? The lupin gang's in New York again. What! What are they doing here? It's obvious. They're trying to take back the treasure! Yo, people! It's me. I've come back to Manhattan! But don't misunderstand me. I'm not going to lay a finger on your treasure. So you stay away from us too. Got that? Understand?! Hmph. Prattle while you can. Ha! You dumb-ass! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! I won't give it up! I won't give it up to anyone! Mama... Here we go again. Junior said it three times. "Kill him, kill him, kill him." Do as he says. W... w... we understand. Mike, you got anything to say? Pl... please, spare me. Is that all you have to say? I beg you! Pi-please, spare me. Twice you failed to kill lupin. Your third failure was daisuke jigen. You got right next to him and you couldn't finish him off, huh? Don't move! There's a fly on your ass! Dispose of him. There's one huge cavern down here too! Look, jigen! Real gold ingots! Huh? What the?! We've struck it rich! Are you saying this is the gold of Babylon?! Lupin, you all right? Uh-huh. So how'd you know this was it, anyway? Oh, that. I noticed that the Manhattan inscriptions... Were distributed in a circular manner. I simply thought that something might be found if we dug at the center. I tried the theory that the cuneiforms engraved on their faces went flying out like engraving plates. Ah, I see. So that solves the inverse characters mystery. The golden tower of babel was transported intact, from the ruins of Babylon to here. Who transported it? I dunno, I dunno. How in the hell could they possibly move it 2500 years ago? I dunno, I tell you! But, as I said earlier, whether it's aliens or gods... Those things you hate may well show up! Heh! Now I want a drink. Time's running out, jigen. Time? The aliens'll be coming to pick this up soon. What?! What did you say? Old lady rosetta said it: "Every 76 years, stand atop the shining tower of babel." Isn't there a comet that passes by here every 76 years? Halley's comet? Halley's comet comes closest to earth at 11:00 pm tomorrow night. 25 hours from now. Just thinking that these are all solid gold depresses me. You said it. It all seems stupid somehow. This should be enough. We've got plenty. Two boatsful, huh? Yeah. And I'd appreciate a glassful much more. You got a point there. Hey, Sam, long time no see. Have I once again cut something worthless? Oh, this is pathetic! Should you really be in a place like this? The 76th year is tomorrow. You know by now, don't you. Where is the shining tower? It's Madison square garden. I see! Thank you! Fujiko's been captured at marciano's place! What?! Take care of this! Fujiko! Fujiko! "Open sesame.” Fujiko! We've been waiting for you, lupin! Drop the piece. Don't you see this? This is a very powerful bomb. If I squeeze it just a bit, everything within 100 meters will go sky-high. Enough bluffing. I'm quite familiar with your tricks. When it comes to fujiko you won't do anything that will endanger her, now will you? Watch! This is the end of the marciano outfit! As of today, I run Manhattan. I designed this building together with his father, but I know of a much more interesting place. Let me show it to you... It'll be the last thing you in this world. I'm sorry. A jet black river runs through the lowest level of Manhattan's bedrock. Now you'll join, somewhere, all the other worms that have been executed here. Where is this? Inside the tower of babel. The golden tower of babel, that is. This is a view you don't get to see very often! Old lady rosetta's smart too. She's probably already there. I've got no idea at all what's going on. Hey, explain it to me, lupin. It is said that once upon a time, god collected all the gold in babylonia... And had humans make it into a tower. God came riding a comet, and took that tower high into the sky. However, for some reason, along the way god dropped the tower. It was an uninhabited land. 2000 years later, people lived and loved here... And it became a town called New York. And that's the story. This is the tower of babel? Why...? Why did god try to steal gold? He likes it. What would he use it for? He'd use it for money, don't you think? Huh? God uses money too? Indeed he does. What does he use it for? To buy the things he wants. What does he do when he buys the things he wants? He gobbles them up! Save me, lupin! Ouch! Sorry for going ahead of you! All out. Fujiko... are you all right? Hey, how do you think they'll move it? Move what? Huh? Why don't we think about it while we look up at the stars? The "god" is an alien, is that it? Uh-huh. The golden tower of babel is going to the sky... what a waste! What a magnificent sight! Are you just gonna suck your thumb and watch it, lupin? Stop, thief! Whaddya say, lupin? "Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's!" Yes! It belongs to humans! It belongs to me! Thank you, lupin. I am an alien. There are those who have also called me a goddess. I was sent to earth to search for the lost tower of babel. Only once every 76 years do I have a chance to go back. What a long time it's been. I get it, so you had me search for this thing, right? Yes. What neither Alexander the great, Napoleon... Nor even Hitler was able to do, you have done. Thank you. This belongs to me! I'm not giving it to you people! I love you. It would've been better if I didn't... It is my destiny to return to my planet. Good-bye, lupin. It would be amusing to try accompanying her to the ends of the universe. Pardon me! "Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's..." ¥...and unto the earth that which is the earth's..." I feel refreshed! Lupin. What is it, fujicakes? You dummy. Huh...? You've finally lost, huh, lupin? This time for sure, I'll lock you up, take you to Tokyo... So long, pops! Take care! Are you all waiting for lupin? No! That know-nothing zenigata! Come on, go-! Oh no, the tower of babel has fallen apart! Don't worry. We'll just have rosetta search for it again, right? I can't wait 76 years! Lupin, I'll just have to bet on you.
