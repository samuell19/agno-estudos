'It was a beautiful sunset here in Los Angeles, 'but don't let that one fool you. 'There's a storm coming later tonight. It'll be fast and fierce, 'so don't go out looking for things that go bump in the night. 'Stay home and connect with the bold and the beautiful. 'Get in a chat room at American love online and feel the heat. 'American love online is the only Internet singles bar with no holds barred. 'No rules, no regulations, no restrictions. 'Only people meeting people and having a good time. 'American love online, where a new adventure is born every split second.' it's a beautiful evening. - Yeah. - Don't spend it surfing the web. If you get bored, watch a movie. But I like those chat rooms. You like those chat rooms. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. Admit it. Ok, I admit it, yeah. I admit it, I admit it, I admit it. I admit it, sometimes I do. Who do you talk to? Hmm. You'd like to know. So, shall I wheel you to the screening room? What, am I an invalid now? Well, you're not exactly fleet of foot, are you? Well, skiing wasn't my idea. So, now I'm gonna pay the price, am I? You haven't begun to pay. Mm. For the rest, I feel most contented here. Solitude is precious balm to my heart in these paradisiac parts. And the abundance of this youthful season, gives warmth to a heart that is oft to tremble with horror. Cancel that. Start new page. 'Call my number. 'You're in heaven with me.' 'I'm kinky and hot. 'Call me.' 'I will do anything you tell me to. 'Just call me. 'I'm the one for you.' 'Oh, baby. I'm yours.

Is this absolutely necessary? I just want to make sure that you're safe and that my house is in one piece when I get back. All that so hal here can take care of me, huh? 'System is idle.' - you're pushing the wrong buttons. - No, I'm not. - You're pushing the wrong buttons. - I know how to push your buttons. Yeah, but you're pushing these buttons wrong. 'Welcome, Ben.' See? We're mates. We communicate. Macho male bonding. How come it didn't work for me? - Well, you don't care about electronics. - Yes, I do. Women don't care about electronics. That's why god created man. God created man to fill the void of the phallic smartass. And that, my love, you do to perfection. It's just one of the things I do to perfection. Alright. How do I enter hal's functions? Sondra, please do me a favor. Don't call him hal. Does he take offense? Not always, but when he does, he'll either shut down or completely reset himself. - And then you'll be in trouble. - Mm. Typical male behavior. Alright, after the password, do I hit enter? No, hit the code. And now enter. Good. - Cool. - Have fun. Thanks. 'Accessing master management system.' Ha, the online, baby. Let's see how good I am at this. So, what have you done now? What, do you think you're a rockstar? So, what did you type? "Insanity". Now listen, sondra. This is not a PlayStation. This is a sophisticated computer that controls and automates the house, ok? Mm. I thought it was the beginning of a beautiful relationship. You just treat hal with a bit of respect, and he'll keep you safe. Yeah, and utterly lonely in this cold, scary abortion of a house. Oh, thank you. Coming from an anachronistic female like you... Here go the $25 words again. It's a compliment, ok? What can I say? I'm a sucker for the human touch. Oh, my sister's staying over tonight. Good. Now I won't have to feel so guilty about leaving you all by yourself. The life of a celebrated architect. I hate weekends. Hate to break it up, lovebirds, but technically, we've already missed the plane. - Oh. - Ok. So, remember what the doctor said? No crutches, no standing whatsoever. I've got crutches. I can stand if I want to. You are so stubborn. And hardheaded. And opinionated. - Yeah. - And what else? Well, that's why I love you. - See you soon. - Ok. 'Door open. Goodbye, Ben.' Ah, yes. Thank you, francois. See you tomorrow? Alright. How do I do this? Yeah... you two behave. A pretty secretary's never good news. Alright. The wolf's away, and now we play.

'Away on business, but I never stopped thinking of you.' miss you, too, my love. Call me. 'Call me.' he's got your number? Jerk. Can't. Not alone yet. 'Can't. Not alone yet.' 'Let's grab a private room. I need sex.' god, I'm in trouble. Yeah, me too. 'Yeah, me too.' 'Leave her alone.' 'Hey, werth. How'd you do that?' 'Wow, werth. What was that?

'As you wish.' hey, moron! - Go jerk off on a porn site. - 'Hey, moron! 'Go jerk off on a porn site.' 'Don't yell.' I'll yell if I want to, zit face. 'Zit face, zit face, zit face...' 'Still want to yell?' that was a lesson, loverboy. Take it and avoid the next level. Apologize and leave. 'This isn't you're room, jerk.' every room is mine. I am master of the game. 'Then go to hell where you belong.' 'I am in hell, pal. 'As a matter of fact, for simplistic cretins like you, I am hell.' yeah, sure. Oh, Jesus. 'Visitor at front gate. 'Would you like to open gate?' 'The gate is now opening. 'Main door open. - 'Good evening, misty.' - Hi, hal. 'Main door closed. Visitor logged.' oh, buzz off, hal. Honey, I'm home! I'm here, misty! - Hey. - Hey. What's up? Nothing. I'm being flamed by an online psycho. Jesus, you really pissed him off. - Fighting again? - I wasn't fighting. I was just chatting when he slithered in like some snake from hell. Thank god I'm just a screen name. You're pretending to be loverboy. So, what's next, check into a virtual hotel and have cyber-sex? Yeah, right. So, who is this werther? Some zit-popping freak hacker. Hmm. A kid with a goethe screen name. Goethe? You know, Johann Wolfgang Von goethe? The German master of literature. Wrote faust. Wanna play? Not really. Let's whip his little educated ass. Come on. Hey, werther. My friend here says you're afraid of women. Is that true? Are you sexophobic? You both die! 'You both die.' this guy. He's getting too creepy for me. - Yeah, that's enough. Turn this thing off. - Jerk! Hey, hey, hey. You're my nurse, you're my sister, you're not my chaperone, ok? - Well, turn it off. - Nurse misty, by the way, I really have to go to the bathroom. My bladder's exploding. - Ok, here. - Please. Ok, after the bathroom, we're doing something else. Don't you think you're a little old for this? How very convenient. Two birds, one stone. "Your proposal to go private and make love accepted. "Shall we?" That'll be a first for you. "I wanna go to a place where every tree, every hedgerow "is a posy of blossoms "and one could wish to be a cockchafer floating in a sea of wonderful scents "and finding all one's nourishment there." Love to. Name it. "Follow me to the morgue." In a morbid mood, I see. "Only when kept waiting. "Let's go." Here we go. Wait a minute. What? He's using Ben's screen name to get creme brulée into a private room. So, he's just a kid. What if we're wrong? 'Access denied. Screen name in use by another subscriber.' I don't believe this. He blocked our screen name. He's a hacker. Send one of those instant messages. 'Werther took my screen name to get you in a private room. 'Avoid further contact. 'He maybe be dangerous.' "Werther took my screen name to get you in a private room." 'The member you im does not accept communications.' wonderful. Try to go in. He called it, uh... Scroll back a bit. There it is. "The morgue". 'Access granted. 'You are now entering the morgue.' This is really weird. Log off. I mean, I gotta know what he's doing with creme brulée. Having dessert. Turn it off. Shh. God! 'Game on!' jerk. Good. This isn't our business. What about that girl? I mean, what if that sicko asks her out as loverboy? Who's gonna go out with him? He's mental case. 'Connection has been terminated, Ben.' she chatted with Ben. What if she trusts him? Jesus! Shouldn't we report this to the service? And admit you've been using Ben's screen name? What if he finds out? What if they cancel it? He'll kill you. I guess nothing serious can happen, right? Are you totally out of your mind? You're drop-dead gorgeous and use the Internet to land a guy? Internet, sky bar, it's all the same. As long as the people you're meeting are interesting. And this one is. What if he's also a psycho? Oh, please, Sarah. I mean, he's told me all about himself. - He's in his thirties... - Mm-hmm? And an architect. - Mm-hmm. - And very rich. Sounds impressive. This one's mine, sweetie. So, my place or his? What do you say? - I say the lesser of two evils. - Ok, mine. Since it'll make you feel better. Now go. I don't need competition. - Be good. - Wouldn't count on it. Then be careful. Hey, I didn't spend all that money on self-defense for nothing. If something bad happens, just notify my next of kin. That's cute, Lynn. Very cute. Just call me and let me know that everything's ok. Get out of here. I'm out. Bye, Arthur. The town itself is disagreeable. But on the other hand, there is a natural, inexpressible beauty all around. 'You are now connected to American love online.' 'Hey, Ben. 'You there? 'Too bad you're not watching 'because I'm about to kill your girl.' Look at him. Probably a major asshole. Yeah. '...At the hospital for sick children. 'Tracy hooper was given the liver of a nine-year-old accident victim 'in a four-hour operation. 'Fighting broke out overnight between rival factions 'along the Israeli-Syrian border. 'Initial reports claimed Israeli jet fighters bombed a guerrilla base, 'killing at least 49 soldiers and 13 civilians.' - Hello? - The garden is a simple one. When the moment one enters, one feels that it was designed, not by some scientific gardener, 'but by a feeling heart intending to take pleasure here.' yeah, that's very romantic, but where are you? Watching you. Come on, Ben. You're scaring me. I'm just kidding. Um, something came up, and I won't be able to make it. Not tonight, at least. 'Sorry if I let you down. 'I promise I'll make it up to you next time.' well, I don't know if there's going to be a next time. I'll call you. Wait a minute. How did you get this phone number? Oh... the secrets we keep. - I gotta go. - You sound disappointed. I just learned a really valuable lesson. Never trust a man without a face. Chamomile tea will make you sleep like a baby. Hey, will you pass me those pills off the counter? - Killer meds, huh? - Mm. - From zero to zs in thirty seconds. - Can I have one? - No. - Come on. No. - There you go. It's hot. - Thanks. I'm tired. Yeah, it's time for bed. Careful. One, two. You're almost there. 'Ooh, you have email.' - hey. - 'Ooh, you have email.' come on, come on, come on. I just want to see what's on the screen. - No, not again. - Just one second. - Please? - Just one second, come on. 'Hey, Ben. - 'You there?' - That freaks me out. - He's just playing games. - No, he's not. He knows Ben's real name. 'Too bad you're not watching 'because I'm about to kill your girl.' Goodnight, drop-dead gorgeous. 'Live from werther.' This can't be for real. He is paying creme brulée a visit. Save it. Come on, these things don't happen. This is... Maybe he staged it. Maybe it's a prank. His version of the Blair witch project. - It's 11:06. - It's happening right now. He wired himself to the web on a live feed. - Misty, he's gonna kill her. - I'm calling 911. - Where is he? - What? Where is he? Well, think about it. Who is he? This is the Internet, misty. It's not some little neighborhood. I mean, what are you gonna tell them, that somewhere, in some city, an unknown man is killing an unknown woman? - They're gonna laugh at you. - Well, I can't just sit and watch this. Oh, god. Let this be a joke. Maybe he'll stop at that. Maybe he's just a copy cat trying to scare us. He's doing a hell of a job. 'Stand by for more.' shit! - I'm calling the police. - I'm calling Ben. You call Ben, then I'll call the police. Oh, my god. - This psycho's in town. - What do you mean? How do you know that? - The chat room. It's only for Los Angeles. - What? 'The cellular subscriber you are calling 'is temporarily out of the service area.' - oh, god. Not now. - 'Please try later.' shit, not now. - It's out of range. - Well, the police aren't. 'If you are trying to make a call, 'please hang up and try again.' Lynn_. You look so much like lotte. Who's he talking about? Who's lotte? Werther's eternal love. He died for her. Oh, my god. Do women have hearts? What? What I was meaning to tell you, she has a great soul which gazes at one straight through the blue eyes. Oh! The thunder was passing by. The wonderful rain was falling on the land. Filling the air with the most refreshing fragrance. Oh, my god! What is this? 'If you only had seen the adoration in those eyes. 'Yes, women do have hearts.' my heart's immense and ardent feeling for living nature... Which ovennhelmed me with so great a joy and made the world about me a very paradise... Has now become an unbearable torment. A demon that goes with me everywhere, torturing me. 'Hello, stranger. 'Tell me your name, and I may pick up the phone. 'Better yet, leave a message.' 'Lynn, pick up. 'Lynn? 'Lynn? 'Look, I... I know I shouldn't worry, but I do. 'You haven't called, you're not picking up. I... 'I hope you didn't leave your place or something. 'If I don't hear from you soon, I'm gonna come by the house.' no, officer. Nothing happened to us. Just listen to me. Some guy killed a girl in plain view. 'Whose view, ma'am?' ours, dammit. 'You witnessed a murder? Where? Well, I don't know exactly. Somewhere in la. It was on the Internet. 'I see. 'And you're not under the influence of an intoxicating substance, eh?' no, I am not. Some freak webcasted his crime and we've saved the file. 'Ma'am, I'm sure you did, but it might have been a prank. 'I'll tell you what. 'I'll give you the number of someone who might be able to help you.' who, a shrink? 'No, he's with the FBI.' hold on. Ok, what's the number? 'Call 555-2211.' - thank you. - 'Welcome.' I told you. - I hate it when you say that. - Well, they didn't believe us. - No one will believe us. - Look, I know what I saw. And we have it on the hard drive. Hey, come here. It's gonna be ok. 'You have reached a voicemail automatic system. 'Please leave your message at the tone.' Ugh... Calm down, misty. He'll call. - Told you. - Would you stop saying that? - Hello? - Yeah, hello, this is special agent Matheson with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Thank god you called. Ok. If you just click "send", I should get everything from your hard drive. Got it. 'Uploading information. 'System error.' what's this? Uh, ma'am, do you see what you're uploading? Yes, unfortunately. And this isn't a joke, is it? No, but somehow everything I save turns out like a cartoon. 'Yeah, not unusual.' if the guy you suspect wants to hide the evidence, - he may have encrypted the material. - "Encrypted"? What do you mean? Well, encryption's a way to keep material from being re-transmitted or read by an unauthorized person. Encryption is a way to keep material from being re-transmitted. You know, you need an access code. Can you break the code? 'Well frankly, we have a big backload of de-encryption tasks. 'With no proven crime, it could take weeks to get to your case.' I'll tell you what. A skilled technician might be able to take a look at it. Might even be able to crack it. Certainly would make my job a lot easier. I knew it. You had to have voice software. Thank you. Now, let's see who's on the other end. He said if we find our own tech, we'd actually stand a better chance of getting our file de-encrypted here. There's 66 in la alone. Just pick a cute one. Hackers aren't cute. They're nerds. Then find a nerd with insomnia. It's late. Try this. - 'Thanks for calling...' - Answering machine. Well, leave a message. And say what? "Two damsels in distress need a hacker"? "Hard drive preferred." No innuendos. Hello? Uh, hi, we're having problems with our PC and if you could possibly come tonight, that would be great. Give us a call at 555-1087. Thanks. Didn't mention the hard drive. Happy? Thrilled. Now... we wait. She looked to the heavens and at me. Brace yourself. It's going to be a long night. And all because I've been stupid. Well, that's your dumb blonde gene. Look who's talking. Here. - Hello? - 'Is this 555-0187?' - who's this? - 'You called PC brainiacs?' oh, yeah. Uh... Thank you for calling me. Are you still awake? 'I am now. What's the problem?' well, my hard disk, I need to copy it. 'Sure, no sweat. Tomorrow after five good for you?' no. Actually, it is an emergency. I was hoping you could still make it tonight. 'Ok, but it'll be 95 an hour. Two hours minimum.' yeah, that's fine. Uh, I'll give you my address and directions. - Is that him? - I think so. - Yes? - 'PC brainiacs.' just about time. That's very bram stoker. Be nice. He's doing us a favor. Yeah, for 95 an hour. Be nice. Go get him, tiger. You go get him. - We'll both go get him. - Ok. - Ouch. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Sorry. - It's ok, it's ok. Are you gonna open the door? I'm not sure. Jesus. - Hello? - _ 'hi, sorry to call so late, 'but you said it was urgent.' - I did? - 'Somebody from this number did. 'You called PC brainiacs?' oh, yeah, that's right. Your guy's already here. - 'My guy?' - Your tech, he just arrived. 'Lady, there's only one tech working for PC brainiacs, and that's me. 'And right now I happen to be on sunset and teague.' hey, lady. Come on. It's cold out here. Well, if you are who you say you are, then who is he? 'Beats me. You call another company?' no, I didn't. I called you. 'Then this guy hacked information from me, or you, or both of us.' alright, well, um... I'll deal with him. Just come as soon as you can. 'Ok.' that's not the real guy. Couldn't be. He hacked our computers, he lured a girl to her death, and he broadcasted the whole thing. Why wouldn't he tap a phone? Thank you, uh... We figured out the problem. - You can go home. - What? Leave the premises or I'm calling the cops! I just drove all over hell to find this place. - Thank you. - To hell with this. Just leave! Please. You women are crazy. You're gonna pay for this. He's leaving. Zoom in on his plates. Ok, 3-h-7-6-8-x—8. - X-8. - X-8. Got him. - Ok. - Alright, call Matheson. - Yello. - 'Agent Matheson? Glad you're still there.' 'Yeah, here till seven. What do you got?' 'I'm not sure. I think our guy was here.' in the house? How? 'I called a computer place to copy my hard disk, 'somehow he intercepted the call and showed up impersonating a tech. 'I managed to throw him out and get his license.' 'Good, give it to me.' '3-h-7-6-8-x—8.' right, look. If anything else comes up, call me. - It doesn't make sense. - Yeah, but the truth is out there. Spare me the Scully shit, will you, Martha? And sit down. Want a sugar rush, Matheson? Alright, you're the hotshot around here. I got one for ya. I got a woman calls me in the middle of the night says she witnessed a murder. - On the Internet. - Ok. What do you mean, "ok"? It doesn't sound like a prank to you? Yeah, it could be, but the Internet's a strange place. Anything can happen. I mean, the boys in the basement believe there exists this underbelly of the web. Yeah, like child porn, pedophilia. That shit, right? Goes much deeper. I'm talking snuff... Contracting a hit, voodoo and satanic ritual stuff. You know, the bowels of the beast. So, your woman gets her connections crossed, witnesses a murder. With computers, anything's possible. You know that. You know, sometimes I think fuck computers. It ain't like the old days. You know what the Internet is to guys like me? It's a house of fucking mirrors. Computers haven't made my life any fucking easier, I'll tell you that. You like fuck words, you know that? - Must come with age, huh? - Yeah, with age comes experience. - Promises, promises. - Watch it. I could report you for sexual harassment. - 'Hello, this is research.' - Hello, Julie? Yeah, Matheson. Listen, do me a favor and check these plates. 'Accessing mainframe security.' Hey, can some nut track her down and find out where she lives? Any 14-year-old hacker could do that. Am I taking this too lightly? Maybe I should send a couple guys over there and make sure she's ok. A woman in distress, and you're still sitting here debating it? Derek, that just doesn't sound like you. - It still doesn't make sense. - What needs to make sense? Come on, let's get some action. No, not yet. Oh! Ugh, jeez, I'll never get used to this house. Ooh, another gothic entrance. Check his ID. You got ID? 'Yes, ma'am. I do.' 'Gate opening. 'Closing gate.' he better be cute. Better be. 'Door opening.' - come on in. - Thanks. 'Authorized visitor.' - ooh, it's cold out there. - Yeah. I'm sorry that we had to get you out here in the middle of the night. I'm misty by the way. Albert. Oh, I hate that. - Static. - Yeah. There's gonna be a storm. Looks like it. Come on, I'll show you the computer. Thanks. This way. - Right around here. - Thank you. Sondra, Albert's here. - Hi. - Hi, we spoke on the phone. Yeah. Thanks for coming with such short notice. Oh, no problem. It's twice the regular rate, so I should probably be thanking you. - Uh, may I? - Yeah, please. Just turn around. So, what exactly am I looking for? - A murder. - A murder. Fine. - Encrypted? - Yeah, that's what they said. You got it, you genius. Lynn! Lynn, it's me! Lynn? Lynn. Lynn? Would you like some coffee? Uh... wind and rain have passed. The hour of noon is clear and the clouds are parting. Something I read. It means, you may not need me anymore, but there's many lost souls out there needing my help. - And I have to make a living. - I understand. I'm sorry you had to witness such a thing. Yeah. - Real or not. - Yeah. Well, how much do we owe you? I'd rather send an invoice. It looks as though you've got the collateral. - Thank you. - It was nice meeting you. - You too. - Thanks. 'Federal Bureau of Investigation. How may I help you?' Derek? Called you earlier, no answer. Here's the information that you wanted. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Alright. I'd better go and lock up behind him. Yes. - Misty? - Yeah? The gate's jammed again. Oh. Um... What's the code? Uh, 1-5-1-9. 1-5-1-9. Got it. 'Door open. 'Door closed. Authorized visitor exits.' 'Everything is so still around me and so calm within my soul.' What the hell? - Hello? - Sondra, it's agent Matheson. I don't know why, but I'm glad to hear your voice. 'Look, the license plate number you gave me is legit.' it belongs to a Joe montero. Owner of PC brainiacs. 'Five feet 10 inches tall, 185 pounds, dark hair.' what? But... That's the guy we threw out. If he was the real montero, then who's Albert? "Albert"? Somebody else is there? Misty! Sondra? - 'Sondra, can you hear me?' - Yeah. Sondra? Hello? 'Well, lotte remained in the darkness of obscure shadows. 'I saw the silhouette of a woman walking toward her destiny.' misty, get back into the house! 'I'm sorry, Ben. The intercom is mute.' 'Strange, isn't it? 'You're repulsed yet riveted to the monitor. 'Can't help but watch someone being killed so long as it's not you.' Albert. The gate's jammed. Ugh... Don't even draw a single breath. Because if you inhale, even slightly, cold steel will cut deeply into yourjugular. 'I'm sorry, Ben. 'Aii phone lines out of order.' just talked to LAPD. Look what they got. Right, this is for real. Get an address. And I want police backup. I'll reference her phone number from the computer. Got it. You sure? Don't you want to run a manual check on this? Yes, I'm sure. I don't need a manual check. Let's do this. Alright. Don't get trigger happy. 'Phone lines still out of order.' 'All units, federal agents requesting backup. 'All units respond.' your sister's in that house, viewing you, unable to help, while you'll be down here... Seeing just how pathetically helpless she is. - Hello! - 'Intercom still mute.' but firstly, lotte... Go to hell. 'Unit 14, eta five minutes.' alright, we got backup. Step on it. You got it. Love its silhouette. It does not make me shudder to grasp the cold and terrible cup from which I shall drink the transport of death. No, no. Please! Please, help the light. 'Bravo, Charlie, Sierra, it's time for holding on tight.' No, misty. You are now my precious hourglass. Your blood, the sands of time, draining into the fathomless abyss of eternity. An incision this deep will keep you alive for perhaps twenty minutes. By the twelfth minute, you'll get the urge to shut your eyes. You must resist. When I come back, I want you alive. The final curtain is always mine. Sondra! Oh, about those twenty minutes... It only applies to those who keep very still and breathe lightly. Struggle and you cut this time in half. 'An incision this deep will keep you alive 'for perhaps twenty minutes.' 'Electronic chronometer activated.' Is it just me or do you also have that sneaking suspicion you left the door unlocked? Sondra! Sondra! Secure door. Come on, secure door. 'System error.' Oh, my god. Close the system. Fucking hal! 'Override.' 'The front door is secured, Ben.' yes, misty. We can do this. Alright, let's go. Alright. A couple of you guys, both of you head up this way? You guys go this way. Let's go. - Put your hands up. - Now! Don't move. I hope you guys can explain yourselves. - What are you talking about? - I'll tell you what I'm talking about. Keep your hands up. This is my property. I live here. I mean, I hope you guys have a damn good reason for this shit. Hal, is that you? 'Hal fully reset and ready.' that's it. Keep the computer busy. It's exactly what I want. I am not going to die. I told you. The asshole hacked our computer, fed us the wrong address. I'll call and have a manual check run this time, ok? Yeah. So, the front door is secured. Let's see what's still on manual. Ok, support, we have a new destination. 'Dispatch confirming address. It's 2200 sunset Plaza drive.' Roger. Got it. Better floor it. It's way across town. Don't tell me, tell the cops. He's going for the pool door. 'Security system to camera eight.' Secure pool door. 'Unable to secure pool door.' shit! "Shit" not recognized. Attempt three to secure door has failed. Didn't work, hal. What are we doing now? 'Listing intruder elimination options.' 'Activate police communication. 'Activate security lights. 'Secure all doors electronically.' do it. 'To activate circuit, verbal warning is necessary. 'Burglary attempt detected. 'Pooldoon 'short circuit on metal parts. '22,000 volts. - 'Non-legal option.' - Do it! 'Illegal to electrocute without warning.' I am not going to die. 'You must give intruder proper warning.' - execute. - 'Negative. - 'Negative.' - shut up and do it. 'Negative. Negative. 'Illegal to electrocute without warning. 'You must give intruder warning. 'You must give intruder warning, Ben.' - hal? - 'Warning, keep off metal parts. 'Warning, keep off metal parts.' dammit. 'Intruder elimination completed. 'Hal now exiting defensive mode. 'A little over a minute remaining, Ben.' What? 'A little over thirty seconds remaining. Misty. Oh, my god. Misty. Oh, my god... Oh! You gotta stay awake for me, ok? Here you go. Oh, misty. Misty, stay awake. Misty. 'Emergency 911.' yes, I need someone to come to 2200 sunset Plaza drive. - 'What's your emergency?' - A woman's wrists have been slashed. 'Is this a suicide attempt?' no, no, no. It's not suicide. Just come as soon as you can, please. 'We're dispatching an ambulance. - 'Please stay on the line.' - What are you doing? Hey. - I need to sleep. - No, no, no, no, no, no. You need to stay awake, ok?

I should inform you. I'm wearing a passive light intensifier. Existing light is amplified 60,000 times. It also has infrared... And everything else my heart desires. See the cat retreating in the cradle while time starts to count itself again. Ah, auxiliary power to electronic locks. She locked me out of her affection... With silence as her only weapon. Tick... tack. The sounds of eternity boomed like thunder. And while eternity passed us, lotte drifted deeper into the darkness of doubt. So, you managed to hide upstairs. Oh, lotte, lotte. Why can't you see that the longer I wait, the sweeter the ending will be. For me, every room is transparent. But where's my little lotte gone? Here, asshole! What was that amplification again? 60,000? Oh, lotte. You've been watching too many movies. I've seen rear window, too. This little miracle of a unit has surge protection. It shuts down in brief flashes of light. It's gonna take much more than a tiny flashbulb to kill me. Really? Don't talk, blabbermouth. Just breathe. Maybe god is a woman. Yeah, maybe she is. Sorry. I'm so sorry to put you through all this. You're gonna be alright. You're incurable. 'Good morning, la. It's still raining over the city of angels, 'but the storm will be gone in a couple of hours.

When you recover, you come to the bureau. We'll give you the grand tour. Oh, I'm gonna post a couple officers here for a while. Really, why? Well, you know, I don't know much about this guy. And I don't want to worry you, but maybe he doesn't work alone, for instance, so... Until I do my homework, I'd just feel better if there's a couple men here. Just as a precaution. - Yeah, sure. - Ok. - Good job. - Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. My gosh. I love this house. 'Oh, how greedily I absorbed it all. 'Never thinking that the way would lead here. 'Be calm, the clock strikes midnight. 'So be it then, lotte. 'Farewell. 'Farewell.'
