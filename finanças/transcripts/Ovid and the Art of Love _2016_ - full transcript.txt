While I was at war, my wife got sick, I got injured... [Ovid] What war? - This is a time of peace. - Peaceful for the people living within this nation. But what about our fighting overseas with our barbarous neighbors up north? Where do you think all our Treasury money is going? - [coins jingle] - Um... After years of civil war, the newly anointed Emperor Augustus had finally brought peace to the Roman Empire... by silencing the opposition. [Senex] We are glad to have at our helm, a man, again, who is not only such a capable leader and general, but one who truly understands Roman values and our way of life: the Republic, the Senate, and the great establishments of this Empire. Senex... - May I call you "Senex?" - Of course. We are to be friends. I can't tell you how much it pains me not to have more noble families represented. In this Empire, we believe in electing our government. I would not be Roman if I didn't. I want to thank you for coming to see me. We shall see more of you, I suppose. [Augustus] But of course. Then you are really determined to restore the Republic? [Augustus] I have no choice. After all the bloodshed... civil wars... it's your firm leadership that finally brought us to peace. - Tiberius... - What, Mother? Cleary, if we are to maintain peace, we must appease the people and noble families. We have to restore the Republic. Then how do we consolidate power and keep control? We give them values. We give the people something to believe in. [chanting] [Ovid] So how did I, a nice boy from small-town Rome, end up in the big city, the capital itself, become the most popular poet of my day, and end up in trouble with the brutal Emperor? My story starts in the small town of Sulmo, where we lived a simple agrarian way of life. My parents' generation had known only war. but thanks to the Pax Augustus, the peace created by Emperor Augustus, - we had known only tranquility. - [Karina] Ovid! Ovid, the men are here for you! The Emperor's men are here for you! They came all the way from Rome, Ovid! [Ovid] Apparently, being from a small town and of equestrian rank gave me the [chuckling] "right values" that qualified me to be a Paul. [Karina] Ovid! Ovid! [Ovid] And just like that, they intruded on my life. Of course you'll go. It's not even a question. [Ovid] Is it a rhetorical question? - Don't be witty. - I'm not being witty... - I'm being rhetorical. - Stop being smart, Ovid. Isn't that what politicians are supposed to be? Not necessarily. [Karina] I don't understand your resistance to this. Here you've been hand-selected by the Emperor, by His Eminence, Ceasar Augustus, to receive the best education you could possibly receive, to work for the government, and you want to throw it all away... because you'll miss the babbling brook at the end of the property and the dirt road you played on as a child. - Uh... yeah. - Not to mention... Just a side-note: for any of you out there who though you were the first one to be completely misunderstood by your parents... this was 31 BCE. And you've been hand-selected to help the senate more fairly represent the outlying provinces, so that you could help this great Empire reach it's potential, so that you can make society a better and just place to live in. - My name is "nose." - Gods bless Rome! - My name is "nose." - I don't understand, Ovid. Are you listening to me? The boy is complaining about his name again, Karina. Our name is "Naso," that means "nose!" Let's just say I learned a lot and did really well. How far do you really think I'd get? All hail our great leader and national hero, Mister... or should I say Senator Nose. [Karina] What was that? He really knows... oops, pardon my pun... how to sniff out the bad and find the good. What did you say, Publius Ovidius Naso? I hated when they addressed me by my full name. [angrily speaking Latin] I hated when they used their formal Latin. [angrily speaking Latin] The Cicero quotes were the worst. This particular one was from when Catalin had stormed into the Roman Senate after he betrayed it. [angrily speaking Latin] [angrily speaking Latin] Look what you've done to your mother in this time of peace. Is this why your grandfather fought with the Roman Legions? Is this why... your uncle is fighting right now against Mark Antony in the Battle of Actium all the way in Egypt? Carpe Diem, Ovid. Seize the day. [Ovid] And just like that, it was settled. I would go to Rome. ♪ upbeat hip-hop ♪ [Max] Hey, man. Hey. Hi. You new here? [Ovid] Uh, yeah, I j... I just got here. Oh, Maximilius, by the way. But you can call me... "Max." I'm, uh... Ovid.

Well, you know how much blood ties and family values mean to us. Good evening, fine citizens of Rome! [applause] In honor of the 15th year of the Restoration of the Republic, through no democratic vote at all, we have appointed our Emperor Ceasar Augustus' daughter, Julia, to take his place at his almighty podium. And to see how she, through the barter of sexual favors... [laughter] might fix the current political situation. [laughter] [bangs gavel] First on the docket: world hunger. It has come to my attention that in the developed world, while those of us in the upper classes have plenty to eat, everyone else seems to be out of work and, at times, starving. My solution? Fellatio. [laughter] Yes, one lucky man, or woman, as the case may be, who can solve this problem of inequity, institutionalized by our governing order, will receive a blowjob from yours truly. [laughter and murmurs] And remember, this is no ordinary spit! The spit that will alight your dong is royal saliva... [laughter] passed down from the divine Emperor himself. [laughter] Okay! Second on the list: true restoration of the Roman Republic. - [applause] - At last! It has come to my attention, through my position as royal baby-maker and diaper-changer... that while we supposedly have a representative government, this representative government has no actual power. Furthermore... it appears that the Senators have nothing better to do than hang out with this divine baby-maker... since no senatorial work is being done at all. To solve this, I offer you... [soft laughter and whooping] I offer you the whole package... [laughter and whooping] cunnilingus and all. [laughter and applause] Stop, Julia! Stop. This is too much. Lepidus. Your father will be outraged. [indistinct shouting] So today, we will be looking at the Augustan Law Code, and in particular, updates since the Pax Augusta was established, along with the Restoration of the Republic. Okay. Can everyone flip to page two? [Max] Psst! Maximilius, what are you doing here? [Max] Shh. I go to school here. - What? - Today, we will be looking at new laws, such as the Lex Julia De Maritanis Ordinibos, and the Lex Julia De Adulteriis Coercendis. - Can anyone tell me... - You go to school here? I thought you were making fun of me for being a law student government type. [snorts] Yeah, I was. Well, that's my nighttime persona. - Your what? - My nighttime persona. For the uptown clubs and the art scene. I, like, play music and shit. Your "nighttime persona." Lex De Maritandis Ordinibos. Roman males who do not marry are to remain under the financial guardianship of their fathers. So this is your daytime persona? Uh, yeah. [Gaius] Does everyone have that? It should be fairly straight-forward. This law is clearly intended to promote marriage and family. Look, man, it's not that weird. A lot of poets do it. - Poets? - Poets. You know, the people that are speakin', the words that you're hearin'. Pow. Poetry! Okay, next, uh, Lex Julia De Adulteriis Coercendis. - What? - Gentleman in the first row seems to have something to say. Or perhaps your neighbor, the young lady in the glasses, can assist you. It's a law recently enacted to stamp out adultery. It states that both offenders will be exiled to two different islands, and the adulturous man will lose half his property. Very good. One indiscretion, two islands. Okay, great, moving on. Why would Augustus try to legislate and govern people's private lives? Roman values. How could you do this?! My own daughter! My own bloodline! Don't you know how hard I am... trying, trying to bring Rome back to its glorious state? All the people that I'm trying to satisfy? To... to encourage and promote good values, like family and marriage? And now this? This, holding public revels... and bartering sexual favors at... at my... my sanctified podium. I just figured... What? I figured... since I gave sexual favors to my husband, your step-son, Tiberius, for the advancement of your career... surely, I could help out by offering them to others, too. It gives me great pleasure to introduce you to the... penitentiary juris, otherwise known as "the prison of law." [Ovid] Is there any other kind?

Do you, Liviana Romanolus, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you gods? I do. The prosecution may now start. You okay, man? Rough night? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. So, how much did you owe the Treasury? 4,000 aureus. And how much did you pay back at the end of the year? Two... I'm sorry, can you speak up so everybody can hear? 200 aureus. 200 aureus. That's... 3,800 aureus less than you owed. And did you not sign a contract that said if you did not pay back the sum total of your loan by the end of this calendar year, you would give up all of your possessions, land, and house? [Liviana] I did. The defendant signed a contract with the Treasury that if she did not pay back her loan, - which she did not... - [sneezes] [man] She would have to give up all of her property. No further questions at this time, your honor. The prosecution rests its case. Thank you, prosecution. The defense may now take the stand. [woman] Yes, Your Honor, thank you. Why, Liviana Romanolus, did you agree to take the loan to begin with? I did not. [woman] You did not. Then who did? My husband. Ooh... The government, in an effort to encourage farmers, offered large loans to buy land and oxen. At the time, it seemed like a good idea. Our land was fertile... and my husband was healthy. And then the plagues hit. And all of our oxen and cattle were killed. My husband became ill, and he eventually died. I had no way to pay back the Treasury. And all of our savings... had gone to pay the doctor bills. And how did your name end up on the contract? Roman law states that when the husband dies, the wife inherits his wealth or his debt. So you were forced... - to sign the document? - Yes. By law, I was. [woman] And what will happen to you and your daughters if you lose your property? We will be forced... to the streets to fend for ourselves. [woman] The defense rests its case. We just ask that you act with compassion, Your Honor.

So where do we find these buxom beauties? [laughter] Walk slowly in the shade to Romans Colinade. Or the Portico, named after that vendor Empress Livia. Empress Livia's or Pompeii's Portico? Those are sacred spots of the Empire. - That's treasonous. - Yes, and what if I'm married? Ah, then the tiered theater would be most fruitful for you. There, you can find a lover who you can have a one-night-stand with, or who you can... play with for a long time. [laughter] What if she says no? Yeah, what if I say no? Even if she rejects you, rejoice! Why be discouraged when there's pleasure in new delights? Crops are more abundant in another's field. And the neighboring herd... [whispers] has richer milk.

You've rid the land of the Empire's worst adulterer. Why, yes. Perhaps now peace and stability can ensue. I struck the right tone with my speech? [Lepidus] Oh, yes. I thought the parts about commitment to the values of the Roman people and safeguarding the sanctity of marriage were particularly good. Well, you know I've always believed that a good moral backbone will make this nation great. And... [laughs] stability at home means stability in the world, doesn't it? I just hope that Julia the Younger does not turn out like her mother. What was that? I hope that Julia the Younger, your granddaughter, does not turn out to be like her mother. And why would you say that? Haven't we made an example of her mother, my only living daughter? Well, yes, but you know that most people who've committed treason have been sentenced to death.

Well, yes, love, my love... but I have heard things. Heard things? Well, yes, things. Heard what? Well, that perhaps Julia the Younger has inherited some of her mother's traits. She has been known to carry on in not the most savory manner. What a shame she wasn't born of your blood. Well, besides... there's a young poet of increasing popularity named... Ovid. Who's... Ovid?

Our armies... burning and pillaging villages out west. Our slaves and our farmers dying of plague and famine. But Augustus decides to reestablish Roman virtues and family values.

Can you define the word "everyone," please, Ovid? Wouldn't the word... "everyone" include married as well as unmarried women? Well, yes. - But... - Yes, but what? I think you've just admitted to the fact that when you have an interest in sexual relations with a woman, that they are sometimes, if not often, married. - Well, yes, but... - But what?
