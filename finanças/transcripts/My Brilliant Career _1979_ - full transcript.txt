[woman reading] "Possum Gully, Australia, 1897. Dear Fellow Countrymen, Just a few lines to let you know that this story is going to be all about me. So, in answer to many requests, here is the story of my career." [humming] Here is the story... of my career. My... brilliant career. I make... no apology... for being... egotistical... [wind gusting] because I am. - [cow lowing] - Hmm. [lowing continues] I have always known... - [chattering] - [lowing continues] that I belonged... to... the world... of art... Sybylla! - [man] Get up there! - and the world... - [dog barking] - of... - [wind gusting] - literature and music... [woman] Sybylla! and the world... of culture... and elegance. [woman] Sybylla! [dog barking] Go on, then. Take that in the house for Mother. Go on! Get in the house! Sybylla! [grunting] [woman] Secure the windows! [dog continues barking] [woman] Sybylla! [man] You, get out here! - [men, women shouting] - [wind continues gusting strongly] I'm coming! [piano playing] - [chattering, faint] - [piano continues playing] [piano continues playing] [humming along] Sybylla, I want to have a talk with you. Talk away. You're a young woman now, and... I have been thinking about this a great deal. We can't afford to keep you any longer. Do you think you could earn your own living? Of course. And how would you do that? - I'd like to be a pianist. - Oh, Sybylla. That takes years of practice, and you know we can't afford it. You've thought of something already, haven't you? I've arranged a position for you. A position? As a general servant. Servant? - I won't. - We have no choice. - You just want to get rid of me. - I must do what I feel is right. - Oh, I prayed to God for guidance. - And this is what he told you to do? God be damned! [door slams] It's a wonder God didn't strike her dead at my feet. Same as all your damned family. Delusions of grandeur. [sighs] To have such a daughter... useless, plain, and godless. What can I do? [dog barking] I want to do great things, Gertie, not be a servant. I hate this life. Should never have left the mountains. It's not Father's fault. You can't blame him for the drought. Gertie, don't you ever dream there's more to life than this? Don't you want to meet people who talk about books and words and have visions? Gertie, I can't settle for a new dress, a picnic now and then. Living out in the bush for the rest of my life, I might just as well be dead. Syb, don't say things like that. Well, why doesn't Mother understand? Why doesn't anyone? I think you're the nicest, cleverest girl in the whole entire world. I'm not. I'm mad. It'd be better if I didn't think at all. [liquid squirting] [thinking] It's no use for me. I've no training, no money. I haven't any time to study or practice. Just two states ofexistence... work and sleep. [mother] Sybylla! [sighs] Sybylla, why do you never answer when I call? I want you to fetch your father. [moos] It's all right. I'll do it. [men chattering, faint] [chattering continues] [bartender] Looking for your dad, are ya? Just missed him. Left with the schoolmaster. - [man] Blind leading the blind! - [men laughing] [man] As usual! Come on. [whistling] Hup! Hup! Come on. [chickens clucking] I've had a letter from your grandmother. You'd better read it! Says she's sorry to hear you're such a source of grief and annoyance... and thinks you might be in danger of forming ties beneath you here. Oh, Syb, you're to go to Gran at Caddagat! - [both laughing] - Gertie! Caddagat! [barking] - Good day! - Good day, Jack! How are ya? Fine! [chattering] [barking continues] - Go on. - Good day, Bill! Hello, Jack. Had a good trip? Fine, Bill, just fine. Not a bad run at all. - No layin' around, eh? - Nah. Nah. - Got anything for us? - Oh, not very much today. - Only about three... - [chattering] - I say, driver. - Yes, sir? I believe Mrs. Bossier's granddaughter was supposed to have been on the coach. Oh! That's me! That's me. Thank you, Jack. - Hello. - Miss Melvyn? Yes. Where's Uncle J.J.? Um, he's away. On business. I'm Frank Hawden. - What are you? - A jackeroo. [chuckles] That's poetry. - Yes. [clears throat] - Thank you. - [Jack] See you next week, then. - [woman] Bye. - Bye-bye, Jack! - Bye, missy. [chattering] - Go on. - [dogs barking] [woman] Bye! - You're a new chum, aren't you? - Certainly not. - I've been in the colony well over three months. - Oh. Still wet behind the ears. I was surprised back there at your being Mrs. Bossier's granddaughter. - Really? - Yes. I mean, you're not at all like them, Mrs. Bossier or your aunt, Mrs. Bell. They're so awfully good-looking. - Indeed! - Yes. But never mind. You seem like a good sort. We'll have some fun. Well, I'm glad I meet with your approval, Mr. Hawden, in even a small degree. Caddagat! [dog barking] [barking continues] [Frank] Hello! We're here! Sybylla! Welcome, my dear! - Welcome! - Oh, Grandma. Sybylla. [chuckles] [giggles] Oh! - I remember this! - [chuckles] Oh! [clears throat] For the gracious bounties we are about to receive, may the good Lord make us truly thankful. - Amen. - [all] Amen. [clears throat] Thank you. [Mrs. Bossier] Take some more, dear. - Will this be sufficient for you, Frank? - Yes, thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Bossier. Ah. [Mrs. Bossier] Helen, have you seen any patterns in the catalog you liked? Well, there were two, yes. Yes, I bought two lovely ones for Sybylla. That's a good idea. What color, do you think? Oh, sky blue. Or pretty pink? And what would you like, Sybylla? Lemon. [piano playing classical music] [classical music ends] Thank you, dear. [laughing] But, Helen, you look so beautiful. Don't you recognize your own mother? This was her room when she was young. We'll see you in the morning. - Sleep well. - Good night. [door closes] [dog barking] [crying quietly] [crying continues] Ohh. Now... what's all this about? [crying continues] Mother... [sniffles] Mother. [chuckles] And I'm so ugly. Nobody loves me. Oh, Sybylla. Stop all this and into bed with you. Come along. I don't understand you, Sybylla. There's... There's any amount of love and good in the world, you know. But it doesn't just come to you. You have to search for it. [sniffling] Being misunderstood... it's a trial we must all bear. You have a... a wildness of spirit which is going to get you into trouble all your life. Mm-hmm. So you must learn to control it. And try and cultivate a little more feminine vanity. Oh, I've given up. Plain looks never stopped anyone from being... intelligent or witty or... or making friends. Being beautiful is no guarantee of success in anything. But it does help a little. - I have a plan. - You'll never make me more than middling ugly. We'll see. But first of all, no more looking in mirrors. And no more thinking about yourself. Hmm? Oh! [growling] Seventy-eight, 79... 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87... [Sybylla, reading] "I had a dove, and the sweet dove died, and I could have thought it died of grieving. Oh, who could it grieve for?" [continues reading, faint] [thunder rumbling] Oh! Mr. Hawden! Frank. How terribly kind. Not at all! [chuckles] [humming] [splashes] [thunder rumbling] [Sybylla] Rain! Ohh! [laughing] [sighs] [laughing] [Sybylla sneezes] Now you see the consequences of wild and extravagant behavior. You'd have done the same if you hadn't seen decent rain for over a year. [chuckles] Well, a few days in bed will keep you out of mischief. Harry has brought you some apples all the way from Five Bob Downs. You remember Harry, dear? Oh, Podgy? [chuckles] Sybylla! Harry and Miss Augusta are the most important people in the district! Too good for me then. I'm only good for the local boy who has pimples and stinks. I shall make quite sure my granddaughter will never marry a man unworthy of her. - Don't worry. - I don't. I'm not marrying anyone. I'm going to have a career. A career. What in? Mmm, literature, music, art. Maybe the opera. I've not made up my mind yet. I fear, Helen, we underestimated her mother's problem. I wish Julius were here. She needs a man's hand. - Ethel. - Yes, ma'am? - [bird squawking] - Take this to the kitchen, please.

No, thank you. You're, uh, new here, aren't you? Do you work in the kitchen? [Irish accent] I'd be obliged to you, sir, if you'd take yourself out of the way, unless you want me foot in your big, fat face. [gasps] How about, um, a reward? Let me go. - [grunts] - You should be ashamed. A gentleman like yourself peepin' and pryin' on innocent girls. You'll have me sacked, you will. What's your name? Wouldn't you like to know! Ah. [chuckling] Hmm. Ah, it's a picture, you are! Can't I look now? What do you think, Biddy? Well, ma'am, I don't think the glass'll break. [all laughing] Biddy! I hope you can say something to your Uncle Julius. Uncle J.J.? He's not here! - Mm-hmm. - Oh! Thank you, Aunt Helen. It's beautiful. [Mrs. Bossier] Oh, Sybylla! [man] There she is! Uncle J.J.! [laughing] [laughing] Here. By George, you're a good-looking young lady! Ah. You've changed, no doubt about that. You haven't. Your kisses still smell of whiskey and cigars. That's what makes 'em irresistible. [both laughing] [Mrs. Bossier] Ah, come in, gentlemen! Hello, Harry. - Hello, Mrs. Bossier. - I'm delighted you could join us this evening. [Mrs. Bossier] Well, for goodness' sake, Frank, get him a drink. Sybylla, this is our dear friend, Harry Beecham. Harry, you remember my granddaughter. Uh, y-yes, Miss Melvyn, I... never would have recognized you. No, nor I, Mr. Beecham. I believe I have to thank you for the apples you sent to me when I was ill. And Frank's very good at giving me flowers. Aren't you, Frank? Y-Yes. [clears throat] Well, the drought up country's not broken yet, Harry. Saw a lot of unfortunate fellows on the road heading south. Yes, we've noticed more calling in here for food recently. Very bad. Very bad. Yes, I was approached by one of them today. A very ill-mannered sort. While I was picking blossom. - [Mrs. Bossier] Goodness, dear! - He was very forward. He wanted to kiss me. [Frank] You should have called me. I'd have taken care of him. [chuckles] I'm sure you would. But I can look after myself, Frank. [Julius] Good girl! That's the sort we want. Eh, Harry? Absolutely. [Mrs. Bossier] Thank you, Ethel. I fear Mrs. Hickey's decided that now is an appropriate time to have her baby. I promised to help. Excuse me. - Mother, can't I go? - No, no, dear. No. Enjoy yourselves. Good night. - Good night, Mother. - Good night. [door closes] - Sybylla. - Thank you. - [wine pouring] - [Frank] Are you finished? - Would you like some more, Helen? - Yes. Thanks, Julius. - [wine pouring] - There you are, Harry. Help yourself. [piano playing] ♪ Ta-rah-rah-boom-di-ay Ta-rah-rah-boom-di-ay ♪ [laughing] Ah, your turn for a song, Harry. Ah. Um...

The only trouble is, you don't know what she'll do next. I seem to recall she was always like this. [vocalizing] Ohh! [chuckling] Sorry, Frank. [applause] [sighs] From what I hear, Julius, last night was little short of a bacchanalian debauch. What? Oh, who told you that, Mother? Ask Helen. She has one of her sick headaches. - [footsteps] - Ah. - Sybylla. - Good morning, Grandma. - Good morning, Uncle J.J. - [Julius] Morning. - Harry? - He left early. I gather your behavior last night, young lady, left a lot to be desired. - [Julius] I'd have said Harry enjoyed himself. - That's not what I heard. [Frank] Excuse me. Anyway, Syb solved one problem last night. - Indeed. - Her future. She should be an actress. Are you suggesting my granddaughter should be an actress? Mmm, she has a talent for it. I could introduce her... Go on the stage? I'd rather see her with her hair shorn off and shut up in a convent. Don't ever mention the subject again. [sheep bleating] I enjoyed meself last night. I thought we got on jolly well together. Didn't you? Miss Melvyn... Ah. Sybylla. I've been thinking. While looks aren't everything, and, um... Would you come to the point, Frank? Well, now that this... this fellow Harry has gone, you should pay some heed to my attentions. Do you mean your attentions or your intentions? At the conclusion of the coming year I will be returning to England, and I expect you to return with me as my wife. [snickering] - Well, what do you say? - Oh, let me go. - Not until I have your answer. - [bleating continues] Well, there is this in your favor... You don't say you are sorry when you're not. Why should I pretend about a person like Frank Hawden? - But you are not prepared to apologize? - What for? - Your aunt and I thought that you liked him. - Liked him? - He appears to be extremely fond of you. - [snickers] Now listen to me, Sybylla. In a few years he'll come into quite a large fortune in England. He comes of a very good family and will make someone an excellent husband. Well, it won't be me. - Oh, do be realistic, child. - Well, I am. To begin with, I don't love him. - That is not the point. - Well, it is to me. Sybylla, do you want to be a burden on your family forever with no status in decent society or a home of your own? I will not be married off to someone I detest, by you or anybody! At times I fear for you, my girl. You are rude to your elders and betters and often lack all gentility. Very well. Though you may not be prepared to apologize to Frank, I expect you to apologize to me... when you have regained your humor and your manners. You must learn not to shout at your grandmother, Sybylla. I didn't mean to. It just surges up in me when she starts on about marriage. She just doesn't seem to understand. Sit down here next to me. Come on. Now, believe me, Sybylla, the best kind of marriage... is not love marriage but friendship marriage. - Friendship? - Yes. You see... your mother married for love. And... I too... married for love. My husband isn't dead. He... He left me for someone else. Left me to live the rest of my life with the... the shame of being neither wife, nor widow, nor maid. But why should you be ashamed? Marriage gives us respectability, dear, as you'll learn. No, that is just what men want us to believe. Stupid idiots like... like Frank Hawden. Well, I won't be caught up in it, not by him or anyone. [sighs] Aunt Helen, please. Please stop trying to marry me off. Well, I suppose I should... tear up this invitation, then, from Miss Augusta... for you to stay a few days at Five Bob. Hmm? - Shall I? - [giggles] No! [chuckles] I hear you've made a lot of changes at Five Bob, Mr. Beecham. Oh, yes, we have. Must have been hard for you when your father died. Can I drive? Whoa, boy, whoa. Dear Lucy's daughter. There's little resemblance. No. I'm sorry. A pity. Well, come in. Well, come along, child. I'm not going to eat you. [clears throat] Well, I think I'll turn in. Early start tomorrow. Good night, Aunt Gussie. Good night, dear. - Good night, Miss Melvyn. - Good night, Mr. Beecham. He always seems so quiet and composed. You don't have to live with him. This must be the most beautiful house in the world. Too big. Too many corners to dust. - Fancy living in it, do you? - [chuckles] No. I'd get lost. Wouldn't know what to do with all those servants. I wouldn't even know what groceries to order. I think another glass of port won't harm us. [birds chirping, squawking] [Gussie] Beautiful creatures. They're fortunate, aren't they? Every day they get their food. As long as I remember. [inhales, exhales] They never have to look for water in a dried-up creek... scratch for a living... like all our countrymen, forced on the road to beg. Perhaps they are meant to counterbalance the ugly things of life. [chirping, squawking continue] Do you read the Australian poets, Miss Augusta? [sighs] You know, I think ugly girls should be strangled at birth by their parents. It's bad enough being born a girl, but being born ugly and clever... [Gussie] Oh. Clever, are you? Well, I hope so. I'm done for if I'm not. Has to be something I'm good at. There's sure to be. [Sybylla] Cool breeze ripples at the river below as fleecy clouds float high and I mark how the dark green gum trees match the bright blue vault of the sky. We wouldn't be out of place on the Thames in England. I haven't done this for years. [gasping] - Oh! - Sybylla! [Sybylla gasping] [coughing] [gasping continues] [both panting] Race you home! You didn't stay long at the river. - [sighs] - You washed your hair. It'll never dry by dinner. - Perhaps I should cut it all off. - Well, no, dear. It'd be a pity to lose your finest asset. My only asset, more like. Oh, I wouldn't go quite as far as that. Hmm. Must be contagious. - What's that? - Washing one's hair. Or did you, by chance, have an accident at the river? No, no. I don't wish to hear the details. Well, as you both seem able to entertain yourselves, I'll see to dinner. I was worried when I couldn't see you when I came to the surface. I thought you might have drowned. What a terrible loss to the world. Yes, it would have been. [music ends] [clock chiming] Good night, Miss Melvyn. Good night, Mr. Beecham. [screams] [laughs] [gasps] [grunting, laughing] [Sybylla screams] [grunting, laughing continue] - Yaah! - [screams, laughs] [Sybylla shouts, gasps] [dog barking] [both panting] [laughing, grunting continue] Ohh! [panting] - Oh! - [laughing] [panting] Thank you. Coffee? Well? She was a precocious child. There's an improvement, but not much. Still skinny. She's very young, Harry, and spirited. Take care. Don't rush anything. - [Gussie] Very good. - [chuckles] Peddle a little faster. Yes, a little faster. - Very good. - [chuckles] How long will you be away? Oh, quite a few weeks. I've got to go to the Queensland property first and then up to the shearing at the Riverina. [Gussie] Wait a minute. [Julius speaking, faint] I'll come over and see you as soon as I get back. [Julius] There. There we are. - Well, safe home. - Thank you, Gussie. - Bye-bye, J.J. - Bye, Harry. - Good-bye, J.J. - Good-bye, my dear. - You be careful with that bicycle, do you hear? - I will.

[piano stops] Here you are. - [rooster crowing] - That should keep you going for a while. - Thank you. - Bye-bye. Good luck. Thank you. Ta-ta. We'll have to watch her, Helen. She'll give away half of Caddagat to those fellows. [laughing] - Can't something be done for them? - You see? She'd carve up the place among them and send me on the wallaby. Frank. And make sure Butler gives you the right gauge wire this time, hmm? - Of course, Mr. Bossier. - Mmm. There's our acceptance for the ball. And make sure you give it to Harry. Harry. Harry Beecham? He's back? [Frank] Oh, yes. Has been for a couple of weeks. [Grandmother] That's all the mail, unless you have anything to add. Um, can I take it? Well, I don't suppose Frank would mind a passenger. Oh, I'd like to go myself. Not on your life, Syb. Not with those horses. [chuckles] Strange that Harry's not been over. Can't have much time for you. Excuse me. Don't go through the gate. Hmm. Oh. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [chuckles] You'll soon realize you can't do better than me. I'd love to see the looks at home. You'd certainly surprise those English girls, you know. [chuckles] Yes, sir. Oh, damn it. [clicks tongue] Hey. Hey, wait. Wait! Damn it! Wait, damn you! Stop! [chattering] How have you been? I'm well. As I was two weeks ago. Pleased to hear that. You promised to come to Caddagat as soon as you got back. I've been busy. You promised. We haven't got that muslin Mrs. Bossier wanted. It'll be here next week. Yes, thanks, Mrs. Butler. I'll tell her. You're just the same as all men. And you're different from other girls. I've heard how you've been behaving, flirting with every man within miles. Who told you that? Who? Frank Hawden? - There. That's everything, Miss Melvyn. - And you believed him. - See you next time. - Thank you, Mrs. Butler. [dog barking] [Harry] Whoa. I'm sorry. So you should be. - I-I thought we were mates. - Aren't we? I'll see you at the ball. [shouts] [horse galloping] [chuckling] And do you mean to say that Frank had to walk four miles back here? [chuckling] In his tight boots? It's no joking matter, Julius. No, no, Mother. No, no, no. [chuckling] Serves him right though. That girl must learn to behave. I've sent her to her room. [footsteps approaching] Did, uh... Did you see Harry at Dogtrap? Yes. Oh. You know, I... [chuckles] I think you might be in love with Harry Beecham. [sighs] We're friends, that's all. Nothing else. Be careful how you treat him. What do you mean? Well, you know what they say: Heed the spark or you may dread the fire. - For heaven's sake. - Well, Sybylla, he is a man of the world. He has quite a reputation with the ladies in Melbourne. Yes, I'll bet he has. And it's always been taken for granted that he'd marry into one of the best families. Well, Aunt Gussie will make sure of that. Look, Aunt Helen, you don't have to worry. I know he can marry anyone. I know. And I know he wouldn't want to marry me. Even if I wanted to get married, which I don't, he'd never ask me in a million years. So... So long as you know. In the box, there's a surprise for you. A lovely new dress for the ball. - [man laughing] - [small orchestra playing classical music] Excuse me, ma'am. Dinner is served. Would you come in to dinner, everyone? - Ah, Gussie. Allow me, huh? - Thank you. What a charming evening it's turned out to be. [chattering] And this also. At that time it was in a terrible state. Really shocking. Anyway, I remember... [no audible dialogue] There were people. There were soldiers. They actually... Thank you. Oh, yes. All right. [Julius] I see that Furlow has bought himself a very fine bull. That should make a few cows happy. - [laughing] - [chattering quiets] [man clears throat] Arthur, tell me... [continues, faint] [chattering resumes] [piano, violin playing] [guests chuckling, chattering] [applauding] And on my mother's side, we're going to go to Rutherford's. The Duke of Rutherford, of course. - Really? - Almost family. [piano playing] Go in, girls, and dance with the grown-ups. - [laughs] - That was delightful. Thank you. [sighs] I'm afraid she's a bit of a handful. I do hope she behaved herself while she was with you. Why not? Charming girl. [no audible dialogue] [laughing] [small band playing folk music] [man whoops] [man whooping] [man shouts] Whoo-hoo! Yahoo! - How you doin', miss?

Didn't you like me dancing with the peasants? - I'm not going to make a big thing of this. - I disgraced you, didn't I? - I have to go away for a few days. - Oh, more shearing somewhere else? And I must be told... is it yes or no? - What's the question? - Bloody woman! I thought... I thought we should get married. Well, what a handsome proposal. How could anyone say no? How dare you. [grunts] [grabs riding crop] Harry, I... I'm sorry. It was my fault. It was stupid of me. I should really get back to my guests. [crying] [piano playing, faint] - Oh! - [crying] The boy's an idiot, but you did lead him on. I didn't mean to. I'm a misfit, a larrikin. - My nose is the wrong shape. - True. Then why me? 'Cause he loves you, and I think you love him. And you make all the other misses who've been through here look like so many pale, insipid nobodies, which they undoubtedly are. But why does it always have to come down to marriage? Don't be foolish, child. It's natural to want someone as part of you, part of your life. I don't want to be part of anyone. Do you imagine you're the only female on earth to have such notions? Loneliness is a terrible price to pay for independence. Sybylla, don't throw away reality for some impossible dream. It's not impossible. It's not. [small orchestra playing up-tempo song] [guests laughing] [people chattering in distance] - [engines starting] - [man] Good-bye! Good night, all. [people chattering, shouting] [dog barking] Hello, Podgy. Hello, silly Syb. [sighs] I've got to leave all this, Syb. We're closing the house. I'm going north to see to the other properties. Why? What's happened? [chuckles] The bank wants its money, and I haven't got it. They couldn't take everything. They could. How long have you known? Quite a while. Why didn't you tell me? I'm sorry. I should have. I was afraid of losing you as well. Oh, Harry. [sniffles] I'm sorry. Now you know. There's no need to feel tied. I mean, I shouldn't have asked you. I... I had no right. I'll be a poor man. But we'll be friends... and mates, won't we? Of course. Do you think I cared for you just because you were rich? No, Harry. There's something I must say. Um, I... I wish I could help you. Could you... Can you give me a bit of time? Maybe two years. You see, I'm just not ready yet. Last night... I don't know, I think I was trying to hurt you... make you let go, do something. Give me a chance to find out what's wrong with the world and with me, who I am, everything. Then I'll marry you, if you need me and I can help. You do understand, don't you? - Of course I do. - [sighs] I knew you would. I don't know what you've been up to now, but Mrs. Bossier wants to see you. - Oh, Biddy, I've just got to finish this pa... - She wants you now. They're all waiting. Mr. Julius and Mrs. Bell. Hurry. [sighs] Damn, damn, damn. Come in, dear, and sit down. I'll come straight to the point, Sybylla. It seems your father has got himself into difficulties again. Money, of course. He borrowed £500 from a chap called McSwat and put the farm up as security at four percent interest. That's £20 a year. Very fair. What's this got to do with me? Well, your mother says she's tried, but there is no way they can pay it. And this McSwat chap's made a very generous offer. - He'd be worth a few bob, I'd say. - Julius. So it's been arranged that instead of the interest, he will accept your services as governess to his children. Arranged? Don't I have a say? [sighs] I won't go! I won't. [groans] Life around here will certainly be uneventful when she's gone. Do her the world of good. Make her think of other people instead of herself. [chickens clucking] [animals snorting] Uh, this is my name... Miss Melvyn. - [boy] Old boozy Melvyn's daughter. - [children laughing] I'll have no more impertinence, thank you. Now, sit up straight and attend. - [laughing continues] - James, fetch the textbooks, please. - Ain't got none. - Rats got 'em. Pa says you can teach out of your head. Miss Killen couldn't. She was as mad as a tree full of galahs. And the one before her only stayed a week and ran off in the bush, and we never saw her again. - And the one before her. - Possum! - Possum! - Get down! - [children screaming] - Possum! Possum! Possum! - Come back! - [children screaming] Come back! [pigs squealing] [insects buzzing] Lizer, Sarah, come on. Here we go. Good girl. [child crying] Come on. Tea's ready! [children shouting, chattering] Watch it! [child squealing] - Save some for me, Jimmy. - Give me a bowl. Mine! Here you go. I don't want any. [crying] - Mom! - [pig snorting] [child crying] Jimmy, I've told you before. Would you use a fork to put the food into your mouth. - Didn't give me one. - Well, use your fingers. - Don't use your knife. - Why not? Pa does. I'm a richer man today than them that don't. - You're right there, Pa. - [Lizer] Yeah, you're right, Pa. [all laughing] Well, your pa doesn't talk with his mouth full. Ma does. [Mrs. McSwat laughing] You're gonna have your work cut out with this lot. [all laughing] [sighs] Oh. I see you've received another one of these too. Really, how can she expect us to believe all this nonsense? [Gertie] I won! [laughing] Of course you won. I didn't stand a chance. - Oh, yes, you did. - I did not. - You did. - I did not. [chuckles] Ah. Ah, Gertie, Frank. Just in time for tea. - Did you have a good game? - Yes. - Hmm. And who won? - I did. Oh. [laughs] I think Frank is being rather gallant. Ooh. Sandwiches. [chuckles] [Sybylla] Today I want to show you another very important letter... the letter "H." "H" follows the letter we learned yesterday... "G." "A"... [Helen] Sybylla, we cannot interfere with your mother's wishes. The time will soon pass. You would hardly recognize your little sister. She has blossomed into quite a young lady. Try and do good where you are, dear. We cannot always get what we would like in this world. As in "hot." Or h... - [Tommy] Good shot, Jimmy. - [children laughing] Whoa. Ma! Ma! Ma! - [shouting] - [stick hitting] [girl] Quick! Hurry, Ma! Ma! - [children shouting] - [pigs squealing] Mom! Mom, get her off me! [crying] Ma! Ma! [crying] [group] ♪ The day ♪ - ♪ Lulled by the moonlight ♪ - [piano playing] ♪ Have all passed away ♪ ♪ Beautiful dreamer ♪ "When stooping o'er a thirsty rose, she murmured, 'Frederick, fetch my hose.'" Page 25. [children chattering excitedly] - Twenty-four. - Look up here. Here. "The devil is dead. There is no hell. The devil is dead, and all is well." Hmm. "And I, the one that have loved him the best... have grown to be past caring. I've grown to be past caring... past... waiting, and past wearing." [Mother] I suppose I should thank God for one agreeable daughter. If Gertie marries Harry Beecham, it will be a blessing. Yourgrandmother says he's come back and has managed to regain possession of Five Bob Downs. He seems to spend most of his time with Gertie, who must enjoy his company. [rooster crows] [rooster crows] [inhales deeply] [crying quietly] - Who's that? - It's me. Gave me a start. - What are you doing out here? - Just thinking, really. Been over to see Susie again? - Yeah. - Third time this week. [Peter chattering, faint] [children chattering] We wanna have a serious talk with you, lovey. Now... Well, you see, we want you to know that we like you a-and that you're being a good girl. It'd be different if you had some property. You see, our Peter, he's almost as sure as made it with Susie Duffy. What are you talking about? Oh, we've seen you... going out at night. We can't say we blame you. He's a good-lookin' lad. But you don't have any property, you see, like I said. You don't think that... You can't. Oh, no. There, there, lovey. I told you it'd be too much of a shock for her. Come on. No one ever really died of a broken heart. You see, girl, things being as they are... we gotta send you home. [rooster crows] I've wrote a bit of a letter for you. Just to tell your ma. And they don't have to worry about the money, not until things look up. Come on. Don't take it so hard. There's plenty of other nice fellas in the world. Oh! [crying] [Sybylla laughs] Stanley? Could you see to Maisie when you've finished separating the milk? - [cow moos] - Come on. Oh! Oh, dear. - [fusses] - Come on. Let's see how that cake's doing. Will you bring that in, Aurora? - There we are. - [crying] There. [mooing] Hey, you poor, wee thing. You poor, wee thing. We can get you out. Come on. Oh, lift up those legs. [grunting] Now, come on. Out you get. Come on. Come on. Come on. [clicking tongue] Come on. [grunts] That's the way. Poor old thing. Feeling better? Let's see. Do you need a hand? [chuckles] [Irish accent] Peeping and prying again, are you? That's a boy. Go on. Back to your mother. Come on. It's good to see you again, Syb. We heard from Grandmother that you might be coming down. [chuckles] I must look a sight. I'm glad you saved Five Bob. Oh, I was lucky, that's all. Did... Did you find the answers to all those questions? - I mean, what was wrong with the world... - Oh, yes. - Partly me. - Oh. Well... here I am. Yes. I don't suppose you thought it would be like this. Aunt Gussie sends her love. She's very keen on me getting married. Yes, I think it's a good idea too. Oh, Syb, do you? Yes. Gertie's just right for you. She's everything I'm not. Look, I've got to change. Father's down in the paddock. Syb! It's not Gertie I... It's you. It's you I want to marry. Please, please understand. You promised if I needed you... I do, Syb. I love you. I want to marry you. Trust me, Syb. It's me I don't trust. Can't you see? [sighs] The last thing I want is... is to be a wife out in the bush... having a baby every year. You can have anything you want. We can go to the city as much as you like. Dear, dear Harry. Maybe I'm ambitious, selfish. But I can't lose myself in somebody else's life when I haven't lived my own yet. I want to be a writer. At least I'm going to try. But I've got to do it now. And I've got to do it alone. Please try and understand. I thought you loved me. [sighs] Harry. Don't you love me even a little? Oh, Harry. I'm so near loving you. But I'd destroy you. And I can't do that. [Sybylla] "So now I've written it all down. Why? To try and make sense of it. It may come out sounding like a couple of nails in a rusty tin pot. My ineffectual life may be trod in the same round of toil. But I want to tell everyone about my own people... how I love them and pity them... pity all of us. The sun is shining on another day, and hope is whispering in my ear. With love and good wishes to all, good night. Good-bye. Amen." [birds chirping, calling] [dog barking]
