Morning. What time is it? 6:15. Ugh. How do you do it every day? Early bird gets the worm. I don't think you've been late a day in your life. There was one time in grade school. I remember. There was a huge storm. Everyone was late. You were still earlier than all of us. I had to wake my mom up and drag her out of bed. Some things never change. Only now you're waking me up. Someone has to. Hmm. Can't keep falling asleep on the couch. There's a perfectly comfortable bed in your room. I know. But I can't sleep. I'm too lovesick. We need to get you over this guy. It's been two months. You need to get back out there. The world is in serious Ava withdrawal. I doubt that. It's true. You're such a fun and bubbly person. Who doesn't want that in their life? I don't feel very bubbly. I feel, what's the opposite of bubbly? Flat, I guess. Still. I feel still. That's just what it's like after a breakup. It'll get better. I have to run. Those beans won't grind themselves. Even if they would, you wouldn't let them. What can I say? I'm a control freak. See you at 8:00? Yeah. At 8:00. When normal people go to work. Very funny. Love you. Love you more. Hi, nice to see you. Oh! I am so sorry. I... No, it was my fault. No, cinnamon rolls today I guess. Can't you just make some more? The dough needs to be refrigerated overnight. They look good, though. Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry. It's all over your shirt. No, I am sorry. I spilled coffee all over your jacket. Definitely doesn't look as good and probably is a lot harder to get out. It's all right. I have another jacket in my shop. And I can take care of this, no problem. At least someone will be enjoying a taste of my cinnamon rolls today. Is there anything I can, I can help you with. Oh, it's fine. These can go right in the trash. So, where do you work? I'm just across the street at Kismet Cafe. I'd offer you a dessert on the house, but I'm going to have to rush to make more. I'd offer to help you make some more, but that would probably do more harm than good. I cannot bake to save my life. Don't worry about it. I'm Lena by the way. Maybe I'll see you around. Jonah. And yes. And again, I am so sorry about spilling all the coffee on your jacket, I... No problem. Just the universe reminding me to have my morning coffee. The electrical contractor called, he won't be in until tomorrow morning, and there's some question about whether the shipping doors should pull in, push out. My instinct with shipping doors is always to pull. Is there anything else? There's a question about what's on your shirt. Oh. I bumped into somebody on the street. She was carrying cinnamon rolls. That'll do it. So, are we still on schedule? Set to open tomorrow afternoon. That's great, you know. People are going to be really excited that we're here. This is Highland Park. The minute the neighborhood hears they'll be lining up to protest the big bad chain store that ruins the vibe. Ah, but that's just for show. People can't help but resist our large open spaces, speedy checkout lines and comfortable armchairs. And not to mention our internationally renowned pumpkin spice latte. You gotta play the long game. It's just the hating us at the beginning part that always gets to me. But you're right. We always get their business in the end. Come on. Morning sleepyhead. Morning. Mmm, smells so good. What is that? The scone of the day is coconut lavender. Where do you come up with this stuff. Flavor combinations just come to me. It's a gift. It seriously is. I can't even make pre-made cookie dough without setting the oven on fire. Oh. I perfected a new piece. For you. Why do you do this to me? Oh, I never want to drink it. It tastes as good as it looks. All right. Here goes. Sorry Mr. Swan. Mm. So good. Like, so, so good. It's our new homemade organic lavender syrup for our lattes to go with the scone of the day. You're the best. I do what I can. Now if only I could convince you to go on some dates. Then I'd really be super woman. I wouldn't know where to start. I never meet any eligible men. That's why you need to go on the apps. The last time I did that, the guy lived like an hour away. What's the point? The point is love. You're the romantic. You should know that better than anyone. Besides, I saw an ad for one that's based on proximity. You could join that. What about you? You know I'm too focused on the business right now. I want to sell my baked goods in stores, that's the real dream. Until I get to that, a man will have to wait. Just join the app. What's the worst that could happen? Good morning, guys. - Hey. - Hi. The usual? He's like my dad's age. Nope. Not your style. Is that anyone's style? My grandma used to say there's a lid for every pot. Well... that is certainly not my lid. OMG... You know, why am I doing this? The real question is why do guys post pictures like this? Gratuitous mirror selfies are basically the reason I don't date online. They're the reason I don't date, period. I think I'm done. Wait a second. This guy looks good. Oh, he's cute. I guess so. Keep scrolling. He has friends, that's a good sign. Aw, he's goofy. That's good for you. Too good. Keep going. He's an extrovert like you. Okay, so maybe he has a good personality. What if we have nothing in common? He had a picture at the beach. You love the beach. Who doesn't love the beach? I could take it or leave it to be honest. More of a pool girl. He had a picture of brunch. You love brunch. Again, who doesn't love brunch? Personally, I think it's the lesser of all meals. Dinner. That's where food can really shine. Just keep scrolling. Okay. You love this band. Weren't you at this exact concert? Give me that. I knew you were going to find someone on here. He's perfect for you. Whew. I just got nervous. Why? His profile is everything that I want. We have similar interests and hobbies, he's really handsome. Whew. Relax. It's okay. Just message him. You have to do it for me. What? No! Do you want me to find love or not? I'm not good at this stuff. Never have been, never will be. I don't want to screw it up. You just have to be yourself. There's no way you could ruin anything by doing that. Lena, please. Can't you just be me for me? Fine. But just for now. We'll start off with a like. See? That wasn't so hard. Thank you. Walk, hmm. Seems like everything's on track. Yeah, it's looking good. I think I'm in love. What? With who? I've never met her. I barely know anything about her and I basically only know her name. Sounds promising. Wow. She's cute. She's more than cute. And she's into all the same things I'm into. I never meet women like this in real life let alone on a dating site. What if you meet her and she's not who she says she is? I usually have good intuition about these things. Okay. So what are you going to do? The question is what are you going to do? Okay, you lost me. I just got out of a long-term relationship. I don't know what dating's like these days. I wouldn't even know where to start. Nah, you're a people person. You got this, you don't need me. Yes, I do. You're a wordsmith, you're charming. I have the in-person swagger but I'm not good at messaging, you know that. Your jokes don't translate well through text. See? But in person they're great. You know what I'm saying. You gotta do this for me. She could be the one. Okay. But only because you've been such a great friend to me. Thank you. Um, let's see. It's all about making a good first impression. Okay, okay. Let me think. You both like Midnight Park, right? What are some of their most popular songs? I'd say... Avenue of Dreams was one of my favorites but most people know Holidays. Okay. "Holidays or Avenue of Dreams? "There is a right answer, don't let me down." What's the right answer? There isn't one, I'm just messing around. See, this is what I mean. I would never have thought to use that as an icebreaker. I probably would've just said hey. You gotta put in some effort. Show them that you read their profile and that you're interested. You're a natural at this. You should put yourself out there. Ah, work is my love. I'll just live vicariously through you and these messages. Works for me. Take me to the finish line, coach. I'll get you a date. Perfect. I can take it from there. I know you can. Thank you. That was amazing. Walker has sent a message. Yay, what did he say? Hmm, something about my favorite band. Why aren't you more excited about this? I don't know. His message said "there is a right answer." Oh, he's just teasing. Don't take it so seriously. I like it when a guy just says hey. No bells and whistles, simple and to the point. I think you're the only woman in the world who likes that. That shows no effort and makes starting a conversation nearly impossible. This message is good. It's engaging. What are you going to say back? What are you going to say back? You said you'd help me, remember? Right. Of course. But just the initial messages. Otherwise it's weird. I know. I know. Now, what's your favorite? Holidays is the easy answer but that's also their most well-known song. I think Avenue of Dreams is underrated. Okay. What are you doing? Looking up a lyric from the song. Ooh, nice touch. Ah. "You're my dream girl, the only one in the world. "My north star, shining along the avenue." Romantic. And that's my favorite lyric. Perfect. You don't let me down. Winky face, send. I thought it was very clever. I think you were very clever with it. I wonder what he's going to respond. This is becoming a Vic? Looks like it. What a nightmare. It's fine. It has nothing to do with us. It's big, impersonal, their coffee's mass produced. But they're cheaper. They don't have the quality or the atmosphere that we do. But you can order ahead online and have your drink waiting for you. But we have the best customer service. Why would you want to order online when you can have a lovely chat with your friendly barista? I don't want to be a downer, but they could put us out of business. That's ridiculous. We're a staple in the neighborhood. We'll do a fun after-hours event if it'll make you feel better. Get all our regulars in, remind them how much they love us. How you doing buddy? I don't know why you made me do this. I prefer to get my exercise doing fun things. Yeah, but you're not going to get in shape playing beach volleyball. That only hits so many muscles. What's up? She responded. Oh. Let me see. Hey. Where do you think you're going? You said you'd get me to a date and then I'd take over. Yeah. But at least stay and give me your two cents. I have to rest. Well we're just warming up. I'm going to go try some yoga. Have fun Don Juan. Make me look good. Good choice. I know you're a true fan because you chose the lesser known song. - What else are you a fan of? - What else are you a fan of? I'm always a fan of the underdog. Not just with songs. In elementary school, I started a club with some friends. Our mission was to protect this one boy who got teased all the time. Glad to know you stop bullies in their tracks. Poor kid. I bet he's super successful now. The ones who were picked on usually make it out the other side stronger. I was one of those kids and I'd like to think I turned out pretty well. Would've been nice to have someone like you around though. I was one tough cookie. Speaking of which, I'm baking some right now. You bake? I have the biggest sweet tooth. Those look delicious. How's it going over here? Good. He seems great. Authentic. You're going to like him. Just one small thing though. I forgot I was talking for you and told him I was baking. That's not too big of a white lie, right? Lena! I can't cook. I can't bake. This guy's going to be very disappointed if he's expecting a chef like you and he gets me instead. I highly doubt he'd be disappointed. You're gorgeous. But you're right. No more slip-ups. Think like Ava, think like Ava. Won't happen again. - Hey. - Hey. Jonah, right? Yeah. Uh, Lena? Yeah. How's your shirt? Oh uh, nothing a sweater can't hide. How's your jacket? In the wash. What's with the hat? What? Oh, this? Uh, I just came from a costume party. This time of year? Yeah. Sounds fun. I need to get out more. We are having a latte workshop. Do you want to come in? There's room for one more. Sure. Here. Here you go. Okay. So just think of the espresso as a blank canvas. Okay. Start pouring in the center. Good. Now make sure you keep the pitcher and the cup at a right angle. Oh. Yikes. Don't worry about it. Happens to me all the time and I've been doing this for years. Let's try again. Sure. Okay. Pick it up. Can I show you? May I? By all means. So this. One, two, three. Wow. That is impressive. Thanks. Did you go to school for this or something? Why yes, I have my bachelor's degree in steamed milk with an emphasis on design. I just taught myself. Takes a lot of trial and error. Well, I know a lot about that. The error part. I'm sure that's not true. Uh, so. This is your place? It is. Had it almost five years now. Wow. But you're so young. I know what I want and I go after it. I love my shop. But it's more of a stepping stone. The end game is to have my own baking business. That's the real dream. Sounds like you've got it all figured out. Hopefully. But I know things can change in an instant. I should check on the others. Great. Okay, here we go. Hope you guys had fun. - Thanks, bye. - 'Night. Burning the midnight oil? Oh sorry, I know you're supposed to be closing soon but I think I was just getting the hang of it. Well done. Yeah, I thought I was hopeless but it helps to have a good teacher. Well thanks. You get a gold star. Do you, um... Yes? Do you sell coffee beans here? Of course. What kind would you like? Whatever you'd recommend. I'll take two bags. These ones are great. Internationally sourced. They're organic from family run farms all over the world. We also have a coffee club of the month if you're interested. Sample all the latest and greatest. You've really thought of everything. I try. They're opening a Vic around the corner. Uh... But I think I'm prepared. My coworker's worried. I tried telling her the world isn't driven by discounts. Kismet is about connecting with people. I connect through my food, my coffee. Bake all the pastries myself with love. We're a part of the community and the community's part of us. I'm sorry. I got a little carried away. No, it's... it's really... You know what, I'll take a few more bags. You can never have enough coffee. They make really good gifts too. Thanks. Thank you. Uh, see you around. 'Night. I think I'm going to take a quick walk. Get some fresh air. Okay. I'll be here. Oh. Hi. Hey. We keep bumping into each other. Yeah. How were the beans? They were fantastic. I'm going to have to come by and get some more. I have very thirsty roommates. Um, I'll see you around. Anything we should know about the opening of The Vic downtown? Uh, come for the discounts and stay for the quality. We have a great loyalty program but the, the product really speaks for itself. We look forward to serving you. You work for The Vic? I run this branch. I didn't realize. I didn't know who you... Were you spying on me? Why would I spy on you? I'm your competition. The only other competition is the other Vics nearby. We both sell coffee. We're competition. Pretty soon you'll be hosting latte art workshops. We don't need to do that. What about the whole bit with the hard hat? I thought you were charming. But you were lying. I didn't mean to lie to you. I came to your workshop because it seemed fun. There was no ulterior motive there. Do you care how your presence here might affect small businesses? Superstores tear communities apart. Besides, isn't there another one of your chains like 10 minutes away? There was a demand for a brand new Vic on this block. In this community, for this neighborhood. The line inside speaks for itself. Yup. You okay? I just met the owner of the new Vic. Jonah. He's heartless. What do you mean? He came into the workshop last night and bought beans from us. I'm confused, isn't that nice? No, it's not nice. It's smug. The nerve of that guy. You know he's like our age too. You'd think he'd have more integrity than to get into big business. He's our age and already runs his own branch? Ava! You sound impressed. Well... You were right the first time. He doesn't see how his store is going to destroy the charm of the neighborhood. All he sees are dollar signs. I can tell. If he thinks he's going to ruin us, he's got another thing coming. We are going to give him a run for his money. Just you wait and see. I love when you get like this. It's exciting and scary at the same time. Thank you. Walker: It's opening day. It was a huge success. It was. I thought you'd be more excited. All our hard work is paying off. I just can't get over my interaction with the owner of Kismet Cafe. Lena. Well, you gotta get over it. Yeah but this time it's different. This is a young woman with dreams. Oh, I see what's happening. You my friend, feel guilty. Is that what this is? Sounds like it. She was just not very nice. Pretty. Pretty mean. We are potentially destroying her livelihood. Yeah, but it's not personal. It's business. - Right. - Right. I had a bad day. I'm sorry if that's weird to tell you. I know this should be light and fun getting to know you type stuff, but I like talking to you. I'm so glad you messaged me. I also had a bad day. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm okay. Why was your day bad? I know this doesn't paint me in the best light, but I think I hurt someone's feelings today. Someone who didn't deserve it. We all have our moments. I never seem to know how to defend myself. All I can do is walk away and then I feel powerless afterwards. I wish I could help. Are you any good at business advice? That's actually the thing that I'm best at. I run a coffee shop. I'm at the risk of losing my business to a competitor. Well then you have to fight back. I know this sounds cheesy, but look at your reflection. Tell yourself you are in charge, you are the boss, and you are capable of anything. Jonah? Fancy seeing you here. Are you following me? What? No, of course not. Why are you in a toy store? Well, I could ask you the same question. I asked you first. It's my nephew's birthday. I'm buying him a present. Need a hand? Do you mind? What do we have here? Board game night at the shop. Oh, that's a great idea, but... Yeah, it's not my place. No. Tell me. I can take it. I just don't think it's best for business. And why not? Well, people will be excited to play games but that doesn't necessarily mean they're going to buy more food or drinks. I'm hoping to bring in more customers. Feeling a sense of community, coming together. That's what's important. People want that. Yeah, I get that. But you know what, it's your shop. You know best. Thanks. How old's your nephew? He'll be five. You want to see a picture? Sure. I love kids. He's cute. Yeah. We're buds. What are you going to get him? I don't know. You know when I was his age I was really into superheroes. I always wanted to catch the bad guy. And now you are the bad guy. No, I'm not. I know you think that, but I'm just doing my job. You're right. That wasn't fair, sorry. I just picture my hero saving the day, not ruining it. I don't want to ruin your day. You're not. I guess it's just an uncomfortable situation. It is. I'll just take these. Have a nice day. You too. Hi. Oh, um, you know what? Here, I... I got it. What? No. Don't run that card. No, it's the Vic company credit card, you know? Think of it as a neighborly gift. An amends of sorts. For what? Nothing's happened. Ah. Thanks. By the way. There's a boy that comes into the shop a lot with his parents. He has a superhero cape that he absolutely adores. He never takes it off. Just a thought. That's a great idea. Thank you. Bye. When did you write all this? Last night when you were asleep. I hope that's okay. I wanted to talk to someone and got kind of caught up in the moment. You know you can always talk to me about this stuff, right? I know. I didn't want to bother you. Besides, he was awake and didn't seem to mind. Well... I'm glad my future husband is so helpful. I approve of him for you, that's for sure. Are you sure you don't want to date him? It kind of seems like you two are hitting it off. I mean, he seems great... but no. It was just texting. Do you want to meet him? I don't know. I'm not really sure that we'd connect. I don't feel anything when I read the messages. You can't judge someone based on their texts alone. That's true. The whole point of this exercise was for me to get you on a date. Why are you so passionate about this? Everything with the shop has been all over the place. It'd just be nice to feel like something is working out. Do you think also it's maybe because you want love but are too afraid to go after it yourself? What? No. Of course not. I want you to be happy. I need to focus on the shop. You can have a little fun for the both of us. What do you say? I don't know. He seems like a great guy. You'll be happy you went. Hey, hey. I read the messages last night. You got real, fast. I know, I... Not really my style if I'm being honest. I don't talk about my feelings like that, you know that. You're the sensitive one. Yeah, I know you like to keep it light and breezy, but what I... It's her. "Do you want to meet tomorrow night?" Do you guys need anything else here? We're okay. Okay. Can I get you guys anything else? - No, we're good. - Okay. How's it going? Well, we've had a decent turnout. But? But most of the parties have been here for hours and only ordered like one coffee. I tried to see if they wanted anything else, but they just want to play and be with their friends. Well that's okay, right? We have the $5 rental fee for the games and the night's still young. Yeah. I'm going to go drop this off. All right. Woo! - Hi. - Hi. I love your cape. Thanks. My uncle got it for me for my birthday. Sounds like you have a good uncle. He's the best. Boom! What are you two doing here? Well I told him about games night and he got really excited. And this is where he wanted to spend his birthday. Happy birthday. Thanks. So sweet. Well... Guess games night was a good idea. Yeah. Well, have a seat wherever you'd like. How about I bring you a special dessert for your birthday? Nice. Thank you. Ryan, where do you want to sit? Should we go here? There. Who is that? Jonah. The branch owner at The Vic? - Okay. - Ah! You did not say that he was cute. Didn't notice. You didn't notice? Well, I didn't think it was relevant. He's our competition. If he's our competition, what is he doing here? And is his table full of desserts? I gave him one on the house for his nephew's birthday. And then he bought a bunch more. Hmm. Some competitor. Should we go catch that movie? - Yeah. - Alright, let's go. Oh, we should go say thank you. Thank you for tonight. You were right. Games night was a great idea. Thanks. And the desserts. They were incredible, right? Have a nice night. You too. - Bye. - Bye. This can't be right. We got significantly less than last week when we didn't have an event. You mean before The Vic? We lost sales from game night. I'm sorry, Lene. Everyone had a lot of fun. At this rate they won't be able to have fun here much longer. You still feeling guilty? What? No. No, we're doing great. It's a good thing, right? Right. A really good thing. Alright. Speaking of good things. It's almost your time. I don't know, man. I'm feeling nervous. You're not going to back out on me, are you? I re-read the messages. All that banter? It's just not me. You two are really connecting. Yeah, you two have so much in common. That's what I thought too, at least according to her profile. But the way that she talks, she seems more right for you. Aw, it's just text messages. People can be completely different in person. You're right. I'll go, order an appetizer, say hello, drink some wine, and then I'm out of there. Great. That's all you have to do. Walk with me? What if she's not what I expected? Where's the confident, self-assured guy that I know and love, huh? Just think about it as taking the next step. A baby step. If you guys meet and you click, great, take another step. And if you don't, well, at least you tried. Right? Why aren't you trying again? I will once the branch is stable. But for now, let's focus on you. I'll never know why you can't take your own advice. Will you go look? Look? Go to the window and see if you can see her there? I've never seen you like this before. You've never seen me single. That's a good point. Okay. Do you see her? I don't know, there's a girl sitting by herself. There's a waiter blocking her, I... Well? Oh, yep. That's her. Looks just like her pictures. So she's gorgeous. I knew it. What are you going to do? I'm going to cross the finish line. Atta boy. Go get her. Will you come in and wait at the bar? Ava? Walker. It's so nice to meet you. Please take a seat. You again. We have to stop running into each other like this. Mind if I sit down? No. I'm in the middle of something. I didn't think people still read those. My sister says the gossip's all online now. Do you mind? Just didn't take you for a celebrity gossip fan, that's all. I'm not. Just shh. Right. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb your reading. I'm not actually reading this. I figured. You know, when I'm dining alone I usually bring a book or something to keep me busy. It's not a big deal. No, it's not that. I'm... I'm spying on my friend. Oh. What? She asked me to come just in case. She's on a first date. First one in a while, so I'm here for moral support. The magazine's a disguise. I don't read these. Well, this night just got more interesting. I'm here for a friend too. The one with Ava? Yeah. This world is very, very small. It's tiny. So Walker is your friend? He seems really kind and funny. Like a standup guy. Yeah, he is. I've known Walker for years. Wait. How do you know so much about him? Ava told me. He seems great. You were right about games night by the way. What do you mean? We didn't even break even. I'm sorry to hear that. If it's any consolation my nephew and I, we had a great time. Anyway. Let's talk about better things. Like our friends. They seem to be hitting it off. I know. I'm really glad we're doing this. Me too. This is my first date from the app, so forgive me if I'm a bit rusty. Same here. What made you do something different this time? Your profile really stood out to me. Oh yeah? What did you like about it? We seem to like doing the same things, listening to the same music, maybe have similar personalities. I haven't been able to find that. I know, right? It's all about those common interests. Like going out and being with friends, enjoying life. Exactly. My favorite memories are listening to live music or sharing a meal with friends. Being outside, exploring the world. Traveling. I agree with you 1,000 percent. Thank you. So, where have you travelled to? They're really into their conversation. I'm not surprised. Ava is really easy to talk to. What do you mean? Uh, Walker showed me some of the messages. She has some really interesting things to say. Yeah. She does. Are you guys ready to order? Oh uh, you go ahead. I'll take the pure Asian kale salad to start, and the magical double cheeseburger. That's exactly what I was going to have. I'll have what she's having. Sounds good. Coming right up. How long you been a vegetarian for? About 10 years. I went to this sanctuary for rescued farm animals and fell in love with this pig named Bella. You mean Green Meadows on the outskirts of town? Yeah. How did... Oh, I go there every year around Thanksgiving. We rescue turkeys. I've always wanted to do that. You totally should, it is so fulfilling. One of these days I will. Right now it's just visiting Bella when I can. No, I know exactly what you mean about her. You know, every time that I look into her eyes it's just like she's staring into my soul. Totally. You know pigs are a lot like dogs? I wanted a pet pig when I was a kid and I did all this research and it turns out even if they say that they're going to be only 60 pounds, they can grow up to 300 pounds. What? You can't manage a 300-pound beast? Oh, I can. But I just don't think my roommates would like it very much. You know, besides I work more than 70 hours a week and I wouldn't want to be a neglectful pig pop. Oh, pig pop. Like dog dad. That's cute. I know. Are you guys ready to order? Oh sorry, we've been talking this whole time. Haven't had a chance to look at the menu. No problem. Take your time. So. What's good here. I've actually never been. My friend who's a foodie told me about it. So how long have you been a vegetarian for? Oh, no. I'm not vegetarian. No offense if you are, I'm just, where I'm from we eat a lot of meat. Oh, my gosh, I am so relieved to hear you say that. I'm not a vegetarian either. I totally respect people who are, but yeah, it's not for me. Okay. I'm really craving a burger now. They have one made of soy and mushrooms. Do you want to get out of here? What did you have in mind? I know this awesome street meat vendor down the block. He makes this amazing secret seasoning. You had me at street meat. Great. Let's go. Oh. Looks like they're getting ready to leave. Oh no. Oh no, they're both still smiling. I bet Ava wanted something else. I try to get her to step out of her comfort zone and taste different foods, but she's picky. Yeah, Walk's the same. He's more of a steak and potatoes kind of guy. Oh, you know, I bet you he's taking her to his favorite street vendor. Street meat. I swear he eats there like three times a week. I think she'll like that. It's more her style. I love this place, and I think it's delicious. Yeah. I think I'll stay here and enjoy it. I guess we did already order. Yeah, but our entertainment just walked out the door. Well, we have this. Oh. What do we have in there? Well apparently this woman was engaged to this man, who was also seeing this woman who happens to be the first woman's sister. Wow. I know. Uh, what else? Let me see. I have to admit something. What? This isn't that bad. What do you mean? The magazine... Oh, yeah, it's got lots of juicy stuff in it. Thanks for offering to walk me home. Yeah, don't mention it. This is me. It's a nice building. It's got good bones. It was built in the 1930s. I love a building with history. Yeah. But is it haunted? My neighbor says there's a ghost of a famous starlet who roams the hallways at night. Oh. I believe it. Well um, this was fun. Yeah. Turns out spying on our friends can be surprisingly fun. I imagine I'll be seeing even more of you now? Sorry about that. It's like you can't get rid of me. It's just ever since we moved our storefront in across from you, we keep running into each other. I'm starting to get used to it. Hopefully it's not such a bad thing? Um, I have to go. I have some work prep to do. Yeah, right. Of course. Goodnight. 'Night. You're home late, little lady. I don't even know what time it is. The night just flew by. Tell me everything. It was amazing. He was so great. I was really surprised. Surprised? Yeah. You and I just don't have the same taste, you know. And you seemed to be hitting it off with him in the messages. He was nothing like that in real life. What do you mean? He was confident and fun and loud. Not in an obnoxious way. We ended up going to this random street vendor for dinner then popped into this hole in the wall bar where we drank mezcal and danced to live Mexican music with some of his friends. You met his friends? On a first date? Yeah. It was spontaneous and fun. I always thought a good first date would be someplace quiet where you could talk one on one, get to know each other. That sounds so boring, Lena. Besides, you can really tell who someone is by their friends. I guess so. He does sound really different from the person I was texting with. But I guess people can have more than one side to them. The point is, it was great and we're going to go out again. But... But what? Only if it's okay with you. What do you mean? Of course it's okay with- it's more than okay with me. I know that you felt a connection with him. You had a rapport. Please, it was nothing. It was just some texts. I want what's best for you. That's what's going to make me happy. How did the rest of your night go? Well, it was going perfectly fine until someone came in and... Who? The Vic branch manager. Jonah? What? No way. Apparently, he's Walker's BFF. What? I know. Walker said he worked in corporate for Vic, but I didn't think he'd know Jonah. Hmm. Lena, do you like him? Jonah? What? No, of course not. That would be absurd. He's our competition. He's the reason I'm stressed, the reason Kismet might be going out of business. I mean no. I can't possibly like him. He can be partially responsible for all those things, and you can still have a crush on him. If he's friends with Walker I bet he's a great guy. Well, even so. We have nothing in common. He runs a chain, I work for a mom and pop shop that I started myself. You both work in coffee. That's something in common, even if your businesses are different sizes. I take it you're both vegetarians. Yeah, but who cares? You both have impeccable taste in friends, that much is obvious. Well, that's true. It's okay to like him. No. I don't think that it is. My man. This round's on me. Someone's in a good mood. I really like her. So, are you going to see her again? Yeah, definitely. We talked about doing something tomorrow night. Wow. That was fast. When you know, you know. It just feels right. So, what's she like? Look. I know you felt a spark with her. No, there was no spark. It was just online. It's not like people fall in love on the internet or anything. Jonah, people literally do that all the time. You know what I mean. It was just some messages. I'm happy for you, you know? This is what we wanted. You're a great guy. You deserve a great girl. Thanks. Don't tell me... The slightest difference? That doesn't make any sense. What am I going to do? - Green Meadows. - Green Meadows. I brought coffee. Oh, that's sweet of you. What are those? Scones. I like to play around with flavor profiles, so this one's strawberry lemonade, persimmon cinnamon and the last one's orange sage. Huh. Persimmon cinnamon. Say that 10 times fast. Do you want one? You know what, maybe we should let the other volunteers have them. They've been here all day. No, I insist. There's plenty to go around. Okay. They do look pretty tasty. Go on. Wow. These are insane. You made these? I take a lot of pride in my baking. It's my favorite thing to do. Did you get these from a recipe book? A book? It's my own recipe. Wow. Really, you should go on one of those competitive baking shows. I mean you'd definitely win. Lena! Hey, Eugene. Wanted to drop these off. That's so nice of you. Oh, they look delicious. I brought hot coffee. How thoughtful. Thank you. Have you met Bella? Are you kidding me? She's practically the main reason why I volunteer. Just like Lena. No wonder you two are together. - Oh no, we're not... - We're not... Together. We just know each other from the neighborhood. Oh, I see. Well, there's some chores that need doing if you two would like to do the honors. - Great. - Yeah. Uh. It's a nice day to feed some goats. It is. I love it here. Yeah. I love this time of year. Perfect day to volunteer. Yeah. Aww. Look at him. He's so cute. He likes you. Aww. Looks like he could just fall asleep in your arms. I know. Should we go visit the love of our lives? Yeah. Daffodils. So beautiful. They're my favorite. I don't know much about flowers, but they are beautiful. So how's the shop? We're going to have to close. I'm sorry to hear that. It's just the way things are. I'll be okay. The shop was mostly an avenue for my baked goods. That's where my heart really is. I just have to figure out next steps. You have to do something with your desserts. They're incredible. Hopefully. We'll see. There she is. The lady, the myth, the legend. Bella baby. Uh-oh. What? Walker wants us to join him on his date with Ava tonight. Why on earth would they want that? Well, they want us to "get to know each other and to squash the tension." Those meddlers. Well, in all fairness, we did spy on their date. Ava wanted me there. Yeah. So did Walker. What should I tell him? What do you think, Belly welly? Oh, that sounds like an affirmative to me. Yeah. Looks like we're going. Isn't this so much fun? Mm-hmm, so fun. It was Walker's idea. He's got the best date ideas. Well, when I found out that you loved horror movies like me, I knew we had to check this out. I'm so glad you guys could come with us. - Yeah. - Make it a family affair. The more the merrier. Oh, it's starting. What are you doing? I don't like horror movies. Well the gaps in your fingers kind of defeat the purpose. I want to see what happens. But I also don't want to get scared. Then why did you agree to do this? For Ava. She's done so much for me over the years. It's literally the least I could do. Oh! I do not understand the appeal of all this. Why do people want to see gore and guts? I don't get it either. You know, I prefer comedies or... Or what? Or musicals. I know most guys don't, but I like how they make me feel. And the songs are catchy. I love musicals. They're the best, right? Yeah. They really are the best. Why do you sound so annoyed? Because I don't want us to have anything in common. We can't be friends. We can't be... anything. Okay. Right. That makes perfect sense. Thank you. Sorry. It's okay. Just don't make a habit of it. You ladies need anything else? Hi. This has been one of my favorite places in the neighborhood. I'm going to miss your dessert the most. There's nothing like them around here or anywhere. Thank you. That means a lot. But you know, change can be a good thing sometimes. It's a new chapter. Very true. We're excited about what you're going to do next. Thanks. Me too. We'll take a couple of those. Thanks. I'm going to miss this place. I'm going to miss it too. What do you think you'll do next? I don't know. Maybe this is the push I needed to focus on my baking. What about you? I've always wanted to get my degree. I was talking to Walker about it and he thinks I might be good at sales. Maybe a degree in communications. We'll see. You talked to Walker about it. Yeah. He's been really helpful. I'm honestly smitten with him. I can tell. That's great. Hopefully we can hang out again. All four of us. Oh, I don't know. Things with Jonah are awkward. He's Walker's best friend, and I thought you guys had fun the other night. That was fun. But... I just can't reconcile with the fact that this guy who I enjoy spending time with is partially responsible for turning my life upside-down. Things are complicated, but try and look at this as a door opening and not a door closing. The world's your oyster. Jonah. Hey. Come on in. How is it going in here? We have a lot to do. We've got to clean and pack everything up. What are you doing here? Well I saw that it was closing night and I just wanted to come by and to see... Revel in your victory? What? No, I... I'll be fine. I know you will be. You're too skilled and talented not to be. I uh, I got you flowers. Oh. Thanks. Daffodils. I know. You told me. When we were at Green Meadows, you mentioned they were your favorite. Is there anything I can, I can do? Is that why you stopped by? No, I stopped by because... Well, I was hoping we could be friends. Oh... I know it might be impossible, but I figured it was worth a shot. Aww. What? Thank you for the flowers. That's a really sweet gesture. There's no need for you to stay and help, really. Please. It's the least I could do. Well, we do still need to clean the espresso machine before we pack it up. There's a bunch of trash to take out and coffee grinds to compost. Yeah, I can do all that. Where should I start? He is putting in work. He must feel really bad. Well, that's the last of it. What else? Not much, actually. Why don't you take off? Really? What? No. I'm not going to leave you on our last night. It's okay. I guess I could go register for classes before I meet up with Walker. Are you sure I can leave you alone with him? Yeah, I'll be fine. I'm not worried about you. I'll be nice. Good. But really. Are you okay? Because if you need me, I'll stay. I'm good. Okay. Go. Thanks Lene. Love you. Love you too. Bye Jonah. Thanks for helping out my girl here. Hope to see you soon. No problem. Likewise. Thank goodness. I thought she would never leave. Huh? I... I was just joking. Jokes usually make people laugh. Oh. And you're the authority on humor, I suppose? I've been known to make people laugh on occasion. Interesting. Because in the short time that we've known each other, you haven't made me laugh once. Well, you've made me cry a bunch, so there's that. I'm kidding. Good. Because I was starting to feel really bad. You haven't made me cry. I'm okay. Besides, kind of exciting to see where this new path takes me. Plus I'm not much of a crier. Never have been. Really? When was the last time you cried? This is kind of embarrassing. It was a commercial. Oh. Surprisingly those can be very emotional. I know. Which one? This little boy sends paper airplanes over his fence hoping to reach his military father who's overseas. Unbeknownst to the little boy, his neighbor collects the paper airplanes and sends them to his dad. His Dad opens them on the base and sends a big box of paper airplane responses. His neighbor sends them over the fence for the little boy to read. Wow. Wait. Are you crying? No. That is beautiful. You are totally tearing up. Let's just say I'm buying whatever they're selling. Which was what, by the way? I don't know. I was so hooked on the story and too bleary eyed that I couldn't see the screen when whatever it was they were selling came on. Huh. Huh. I love this song. Yeah. Every time it comes on I can't help but dance to it. Don't let me stop you. Woah, you ain't ready for these moves. Try me. Okay. Yeah? I needed that. Yeah. Me too. Oh, no. Um... May I have this dance? Uh... Sure. Why not? What the heck, right? Can't hurt. I think this is the first time I've ever danced in my shop. No kidding. Yeah, believe it or not this kind of thing doesn't happen very often. Well, I'm honored. First and the last time too. What do you mean? The first time I've danced in my shop and it'll also be the last time I'll dance in my shop. Well hopefully not the last time we dance together though. Um, we should get back to work. There's still a lot to do. Yeah. - Thanks. - Thanks. I want to make a toast. What are we toasting to? To us, obviously. To the times we've shared so far, to hopefully many more to come. I just can't wait to see what the future holds for us. Walker, that's so sweet. I know, sorry. Yikes. I don't know what's come over me. I love it. I wanted to ask you if, you know, we could make this official. Yes, of course. Oh, my gosh, yes! Yes! I'm so glad that silly app brought us together. Thanks, technology. There is one thing. What? It's not a big deal, I just figure we should start this relationship off with honesty. Of course. You can tell me anything. What is it? You never actually talked to me on the app. What? What I mean is, it wasn't me. I was in kind of a slump getting over a guy, and so I asked Lena to text for me. I almost didn't even show up on the date because I thought you two were hitting it off so much. Okay, well I'm glad you're not mad. Mad? Ava, I didn't write my messages either. What do you mean? I was gun shy from my last relationship. I hadn't dated for a while so I asked Jonah to write the messages for me. What? Wait a second. So Lena and Jonah did all the talking for us? Yeah. I was going to tell you when it came up, but you didn't reference our messages so I hadn't had a chance to tell you yet. Lena seemed really into the messages. So did Jonah. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? I don't know, but take me there. Mmm. I could smell those from the street. So good. Thanks. How was your date? Amazing. We made things official. Walker's my boyfriend now. That's great. I'm so happy for you. Also, I learned some very interesting information. What's that? Turns out one of Walker's friends was writing his messages for him on the app. Yeah right. I'm serious. We were both weary so our friends did it for us. Wait, really? You told Walker it was me? Yep. That's how it came out. Neither of us wrote a single message, can you believe that? His friend sounds great. Handsome, successful, really sweet. Would you be open to a blind date? Why blind? He's not on social media and Walker doesn't have any good pictures of him. I don't know. Come on. It'll be a great distraction. What have you got to lose? Walker and I will come. I'll make it a double date. Right here. You okay? I feel better. Look, I'm, I'm sorry. I... It's okay, really. When one door closes another opens. Hey, you know what really cheers me up? What cheers you up? I want to know. Milkshakes. So, what do you think you'll do next? I don't know. My passion is fostering a sense of community wherever I am so hopefully something with that. But baking full time has always been my dream. People seem to enjoy my desserts. Yeah. You gotta give the people what they want. I want to package and distribute them to other coffee shops and little local markets, you know? Spread the happiness. Well, that scone that you gave me, it was so good I'm still thinking about it. Stop. I'm serious. You're too talented just to let it go to waste. I have an idea. Now I would have to run it by the greater company at large, but what would you say to running games nights and talent nights and charitable community events down at The Vic? That way you could foster the sense of community that you love in the neighborhood that you love, and bring in that small business feel instead of that big corporate chain vibe that you dislike so much. We could start selling your desserts, you know? And if they did well then the other Vics could start selling them too. I don't know, work for the enemy? No, you'd be spreading happiness you know? Making us better. We would just be providing the platform. It could be a great business opportunity. It could be. I kind of love the idea. Really? Yeah. Can I sleep on it? Yeah, of course. Thank you for the incredible offer. It really is kind of you to take a chance on me like that. I believe in you. I saw what Kismet did for the neighborhood and well, I've tried your desserts. You're... they're perfect. I better get going. Oh, you have somewhere to be? I have a date. Oh. Yeah. That, that sounds fun. Hopefully. You know I wish we met through Ava and Walker, you know, instead of competing businesses. Thought I wasn't your competition. Yeah. I'm sorry about that. Oh gosh. Stop apologizing. You gave me advice on game night and I didn't listen. Brought me flowers, cleaned the shop, helped me pack up and move, and just offered me a business opportunity that could give me both that sense of community and possibly push my desserts mainstream. You've done so much for me at this point. I need you to know I... I appreciate it. Okay? Yeah. I just wish that... Wish what? I just wish that if we had met under different circumstances that it could be you and me going on that date tonight. Maybe. Not how the cards fell. Yeah. Just wasn't kismet. Right. It wasn't meant to be. See you. You excited? I don't know. Uh-uh. What's wrong? You really liked this guy. I know. I just... I know this is going to sound strange, but I think Jonah tried to ask me out and part of me wanted to say yes. What part of you said no? I think I was so dead set on the idea that he was responsible for all these things going wrong in my life that I couldn't see who he truly is. Just a funny smart and kind person. Hm? You could still give him a chance if you want. No. If it was meant to be it would be. That'll work. Jonah: Hey, man, what's up? Walker: Sorry about today with Lena. That's okay, man. I'm glad she has a date. I'm happy for her. Still on for dinner tonight? Yeah, you bet. Where you want to go? I was thinking we could try that new food truck. Veggie Voodoo? You'd do that for me? I would. You're the best. I know. Hey you. Hi. You look beautiful. Where's the lucky guy? Should be here soon. I haven't actually met him before. I get it. App date. Sort of. What about you? Oh, I'm just here checking out Veggie Voodoo. Oh. Okay. Do you want me to wait with you until he comes, or should I just go... Either is fine. I don't exactly know what he looks like. What do you mean? It's kind of complicated but, I was talking for Ava on her dating app, and apparently this mystery man was doing the same for Walker. We sort of hit it off. That was you. What was me? I'm... I'm that mystery man. Quit playing around. I'm serious. I was texting for Walker. He gave me his phone. It was you? It was me. Every... single... message. It was kismet after all.
