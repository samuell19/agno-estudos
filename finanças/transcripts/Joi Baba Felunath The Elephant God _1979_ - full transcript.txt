Then the Gods said that, truly, this Demon can't be fought with. Brahma had given him such a boon that... ...no God was able to defeat him. Then Vishnu... Then Vishnu flew into a rage. An aura emerged from his face, an aura emerged from... ...the face of Shiva as well. And auras emerged... ...from the faces of the various Gods. All those auras converged together and created this... ...Goddess, Durga! This Durga has 10 hands. And with 10 kinds of weapons in the 10 hands... ...astride a vehicle... - What's her vehicle? Vehicle? Her vehicle is a lion. Durga's vehicle is a lion, Ganesha's, a mouse. Karthik's, a peacock. Lakshmi's, an owl. And Saraswati's vehicle is a swan. The Goddess fought with Mahishasura, on this lion. Is this all true? - How do I falsify it, dear? The sages have written about it. Everything is true. Mahishasura is true... ...Hanuman is true, Digpal is true, Varunadev is true... Uncle! The dacoits have come. Is Ghoshal there? - Who are you? - Is he there? - Yes. Tell him that Maganlal Meghraj has come to meet him. You tell me what you want, I'm there. Your introduction? - I'm Bikas Singh. Are you related to him? - No. I stay in this house. What's the matter? You've come suddenly after so many days? Sit. How many days has it been since we met? I had passed out in 1950. And you, in '51. You'd failed one year. Tell me, what's the matter? I had last seen you at the temple... ...so I thought, why not come and meet you? We come here every year for the Pujas. Father is here, uncle is here... - And your Ganesh? - Ganesh? You still remember that!? It's there. Why won't it be? It has become divine due to our worship and care. Will you show it to me? - It's kept in father's trunk. And the key of that trunk is in father's garage. Doesn't your father show it to anybody? Showing it to anybody and showing... ...it to you, aren't the same thing. You're very popular in the market. You tend to get defamed if you have money. You earn money like me, you, too, will get defamed. But you also have to see how you earn that money. I heard that you're selling off the... ...sculptures of the country to the foreigners. And the Americans are giving you fat money for that. I'm offering you Rs. 20000, I've brought it along with me. What? - You haven't seen that thing yet. Without seeing it, you're offering such a high price! Gold figurine, a diamond in the crown... ...rubies and emeralds at the base... ...it's of Nepali origin. - How did you know so much about it? I haven't told you anything. This has been written by Father. I haven't seen it yet. Rs. 25000, cash. I know about your business. I also know how much money you owe in the market. If I have to sell that Ganesha to you... ...then I've to learn the art of stealing. The question of selling it doesn't arise. Rs. 30000. I don't ask for things from everyone. If needed, I just snatch it. It saves my money, too. I'm openly transacting with you. No, brother. Sorry. Is this your final verdict? Yes. Who is it? Rest your head on your arms, else it'll ache. Do you know how many temples are there? - How many? How many temples are there? - 33 crores. Just sign here. Is there a bathroom facility in your house? - Yes. Look, I'm very particular about bathrooms. Everything in my house... Are you Mr. Chakraborty? - Yes. I'm Lal Mohan. - Welcome! This is Paras Mitra. - Ok. - And this is Tapas Pal. My assistant had given me a detailed introduction about you. Do we have to sign? - It's just a negligible formality. You're the eldest, you've to do it. You just write your names and sign here. I'll take care of the rest. Your assistant is related to me. That's what I was thinking that... You're the one with the synonym Jatadhar... Not 'Dhar', but 'Yu'. I'm writing a new novel, Kaalgombhir. O really!? Send the luggage to room no. 3. I'm giving you a 4-bedded room. Please sit for a while, I'll be back. - Ok. What arrangements do you have for water? - What? You'll get running water all throughout the day. Hot water will be given to you whenever you want it. Wow! Quite good. - It's good, even... ...though it is not like the Jodhpur circuit house, but will do. Decide where all of you are going to sleep. Do you want the window-side bed? Is it facing the road? - Yes. No. This one is good for a writer. You will get a healthy person besides you. - Healthy? Yes. - See what's hanging there. Seems to be a person with taste. It seems that this has also come with that person. You mean he has brought this big mirror with him. Must have a use. Mere shaving is not the only purpose. You mean he shaves the hair on his chest. - Bodybuilder. Very good! Did you see how my assistant is being prepared? This place goes straight to Dasharsadan. Dasharsadan!? That's a great place. The name's place creates devotion in our hearts. Will that help you in your job? You would not... ...be writing a novel on devotion. It's all because of the thrill of that place. In my hotel, a 26 year old one, this is the first time that... ...3 famous people are staying together. 3 people!? Famous historian, popular novelist and in room no. 4... ...Bishosri. - Bishosri? That famous body builder? Have you seen him? - Yes. On TV. You won't believe, I saw him eating... ...he bend his hands like this... ...and his wrist was bulging like this. 17 inches - 17 inches? That's what he said. What about you? - My shirt collar size is 12 inches. Come, sit. I've ordered tea for you. And yes! Do you know inspector Tiwari? The one at Mahamayatala? - Yes. He's at the station. Yes, I think he has helped me with some case. I met him on the road, today. I told him about you... ...he has asked you to visit him. Isn't there anything exciting in your hotel? I don't know whether it's exciting or not. But there's a powerful sage here, he's said to possess... ...magical powers, his name is Machlibaba! Machlibaba!? - Yes. He has swam from Kashi to here. What're you saying?! From Kashi!? I'm not saying so, that person claims to have done so. This is ridiculous! He gives sermons at the banks of the river... ...there's a devotional gathering, then there's a... ...session of devotional songs. And if the Baba shows mercy... ...on someone, then he gives him a Shalka talisman that day. What's a Shalka!? - You're so vague. Shalka is a fish's gill. Do you want, sir? - What? - A Shalka talisman? That sage has a radiance on his face... ...you've to accept it, whatever you say. Is there any member of the public among these devotees? Or are all of them his paid devotees? What're you saying, sir!? They're all the cream of Kashi. There. The one on the front, wearing a black coat... ...he's an agent of the Allahabad Bank. He's a learned man. A great scholar. And the one with the bald head, he's the professor... ...of Benaras University. And the greatest devotee... there he comes. Give me your binoculars. Madanlal Midraj. Haven't you heard his name? The one whose house was raided a few days back in Kolkata. He visits this place regularly. - Does he have a house here? What're you saying, sir! He has a house, farm... ...charity home, everything! This place is Baba's favorite resting place. Nothing unexpected! Thieves tend to like such places. It seems he's taking a gift. The Baba doesn't ask for all this. The Baba doesn't stay at one place for a long time. Then is his next stop at Patna? - I don't know, sir. Will the Baba dive into the Ganges from here? One Brahma, one sun, one moon. He's amazing. I don't know whether he's a great saint... ...but he's a great personality for sure. Two hands. Two legs. Two eyes. Two ears. Three generations. Three periods. Four seasons. Four senses. Five elements. Five fingers. Five limbs. Five Pandav. One, two, three, four and five. The Baba has a Vimano Ulki in his hands. You've amazing eyesight, sir. I've come here before, but I couldn't figure it out. See for yourself. He seems similar. I've seen such a ulki with Keshto... ...in our colony. - Let me see! Just a minute! Shall I introduce you? He's a great detective. He's the most popular writer. Do you stay in Benaras? - My father stays here. We come here for the Pujas. He's been here for 60 years. Are you staying in Calcutta lodge? Yes. In my place. Is it about some case? - No. Just a holiday. I was asking you, because I may need you. I mean, the problem is that there's been a theft in my house. My father is a bit upset. - Didn't you inform the police? My father doesn't have much faith in the police. But he's here. - That's why I was thinking that I shall ask... ...Father about it, if he agrees, then I shall call you up. Alright. - Ok. Then we shall leave now. As we've to go that side for... I've heard of you. But I haven't seen you till now. There's a program on Saptami day. You can attend. Are those bubbles on your arms, truly 17 inches? See. Touch it. Oh God! I don't get the feeling that I'm touching a human body. It's just as I had told you. These are the triceps, feel it. Those were the biceps and these are the triceps? Is there anything above triceps? Yes, quadriceps. What a great thing. A total build up of muscles. - 400 here... ...400 here. When you stretch like this, that is also a muscle. You open your mouth. That is a muscle. You chew that's a muscle. For every movement there is a muscle coordination. Does every muscle have a separate name? Write it down. It'll help you in future. Really. We know so little. No! I wouldn't have believed it, hadn't I seen it. What a practice! - It needs discipline. - That's true. What're you seeing? I shall change your body in just 2 months. What? Do you want to change? - No. I don't need it. Do you bend rods? Yes. We've to do it. Do you lift people? - No. I don't do that. Whom do you want me to lift? You? - No! You've got a telephone call. - What's this? So soon? Did you see? Do something. They're killing those birds. They won't listen to us. Let's go inside. Welcome! Are you Produshocho? - Yes. Mr. Ghoshal is expecting you. Come. Sit. I shall come. What a painting! How do you feel? Brother, they're modeling the idols of Gods. Wow! This God is like the one in Kolkata. Kashi is the second home for Bengalis. 1.5 lakh Bengalis stay here, in Kashi. - 1.5 lakh! Sarojda is coming by Doon express. Sister is also coming same day by Amritsar mail. Receive both of them. Greetings. - We were looking at the idols here. Come on. Come inside. Father is a great follower of detective stories. That's why he agreed when I told him about you. Does he read a lot? - All the time. Only English or also Bengali? He leaves nothing. I wanted to know something. Was that boy, your son? Who? Nopu? He's just another boy in the family. He was standing at the edge of the terrace wall. And was also killing the birds! Bikash! Send for him. He's on the terrace. Tell him that Father is calling him immediately. Leave it. Let me come to the point. The thing that has been stolen, is an idol of Lord Ganesha. It's quite tall, made of gold. It's embellished with rubies, emeralds, diamonds, etc. Its price... must be around a lakh. To which place does it belong? - It belongs to Nepal. It was brought from there. That picture is that of my grandfather. He was the housekeeper of the Rana. Once, he rescues Rana from one of the attacks of his enemies. Then the Rana gets pleased and gives it to him. Since he got the Ganesha, Grandpa sees small incidents... ...and creates a belief in the family... ...that the Ganesha is very lucky. Did all these incidents take place in Nepal? No. Radhanath came down to Kashi within a few days. He has his practice here, and earns a lot of money and fame. In fact, this house too, belongs to him. A few days before this idol is stolen, a man offers to buy it. And offers up to Rs. 30000. - What's the name of that person? Maganlal. Maganlal Meghraj. Did you know him? Yes. We studied in the same college. Did you refuse to sell it to him? That thing doesn't belong to me. It was brought by Radhanath. It's with my father, in his trunk, now. And I stay in Kolkata. - And what was Maganlal's reaction? I obviously can't say that he felt happy about it. When did the theft take place? It took place, exactly the next night of his visit. Father came back the next day and saw... ...that the key was hanging on the trunk... ...and the idol isn't there. Is there any reason to doubt anyone in the house? The servants, who're there, are all old and reliable. And there's just Grandpa, Father, me, my wife and Bikash. Here's your son. Did you climb the terrace walls? Why? What if you had fallen? Don't you know that you shouldn't do so? Captain Park climbs the walls, too. Who!? He's a character in a mystery series. He climbs upside down. - Yes. His head at the bottom... ...and his legs on top. Isn't it? Who's giving him such books? You? These days, all the boys... You won't do any such thing. He'll read all such weird books... ...and get clouded with such ridiculously dangerous ideas. If I hear again that you've done any such thing... ...then I shall lock you up in your room. Go! Who's Bikash? - Bikash just stays in our house. He's the son of one of the employees of my father. He lost his parents while he was young. Since then, my father brings him up himself. What does he do? - He takes care of the household chores. And does some ordinary job in a Hindi publication company. If we could meet your father... Yes. He's waiting for you. One thing. Father is a little short tempered. And yes! Father doesn't know about Magalal's visit. Take care. - Ok. Take care. It seems that a gramophone is playing. It's my grandfather. He's 84. Once upon a time, he was very fond of music. Now, the only thing that he does is key the gramophone... ...and change the records. Father, they've come. - Let me see. How great a detective are you? Are you 6 feet tall? - Yes. And he? - I'm 5.5. I've no interest in your height. Detectives in novels have a person with them. Like Holmes had Watson. The other one had Hastings. Our Byomkesh had Ajit. Are you like that? This is my friend. You can call him my assistant... ...my cousin brother, Tapesh. Looking at your appearance, it doesn't seem that you're dumb. That too, when the three of you won't be working together. Come. Let's sit in my room and discuss. I've kept records of everything. This is my family's photo. Beautiful! - Not only beautiful, it's a work of art. It isn't a small thing. That's the reason I don't believe that... ...small things can't change a man's life. Now see, detective sir. Watch carefully. This is the key of my trunk. Here, I'm opening it. Here's the key. Come. Come. Here's my trunk, I'm opening it. Here, I twisted my wrist. Here's the drawer. Here's where my Ganesha was kept. The Ganesha isn't there. - How was the trunk, when opened? The drawer was open, the trunk... ...was open, and the key was hanging. This is my bed. I slept at 10.30 that night. Do you sleep soundly? - Not quite soundly. I have a habit of consuming opium. When I sleep, I don't have much awareness. But that night, while sleeping, I heard a noise. I thought that it was just another noise, and dozed off. Look at all this. Can you say what all these are, assistant sir? Detective novels. I've swallowed every book. So, cunningness won't work with me. If you're able to catch the thief, then you'll be well rewarded. Or else, chili powder. I've 2 questions. - What? Why did you call me? You could've done this yourself. Had I been of your age, and possessed your strength... ...then I wouldn't have called you. Then second question is, do you doubt anybody? No one from the viewpoint of a father. I won't say anything more than that. The rest is your job. I had warned you earlier. Can I go to the terrace? - Of course. You can tour the house. I'll send Bikash with you. You can tell him if you need anything. Ok. C'mon. Is this the house of Captain Spark? If there's Spark, then there must surely be an assistant. He's there. - Raxit? - Yes. Khudiram Rakkhito. That Rakkhito is Raxit. The Ganesha was stolen despite... ...the presence of Captain Spark, in the house? How did this happen? Did this happen for good? It's with a king. Which king? An African king. How did you know? - Captain Spark knows it. Can't it be taken back from that king? Spark will do it. - Will he? Else it'll go back to Atlantis. The secret city under the ocean? - Yes. It seems this boy has swallowed all detective novels. Atlantis has been mentioned in one of the detective books. Can I see Captain Spark's house? Here! Are you a detective? Do you have a harpoon? An extra gun? Then what do you have? What I have, isn't with me now. The revolver that shoots? How many bullets? Six. I can show it to you, only if you promise me that you... ...won't climb the terrace walls, again. I've another weapon. It can't be seen. What? - Intelligence. It's kept over here. Sometimes, it suddenly enters a person's mind, and learns... ...all that is stored there. It's saying that Captain Spark likes to talk in Hiyali. Do you know Hiyali? 'It is a strange thing. You chew it and it tastes good'. Do you know Hiyali? 'Five brothers are together, eating rice with fish'. 'There are five more. How do you do? ' 'Five brothers are together, eating rice with fish'. 'There are five more. How do you do? ' Ok. I shall leave now. Your grandfather has given us a job. If we aren't able to do it, then we'll be defamed. What's your name? - My good name is Captain Famous. And real name is Pradosh Mitra. Come. Tea has been ordered for you. Come. What's Rukku's good name? - Rukmini Kumar. Are you Raxit? - What? Captain Spark's assistant. I'm won't be surprised if I'm made one. Because last year, he was Tintin, and I was Captain Haddock. Since when did the painting start? Since when did the painting start, sir? - Since Saturday. Does he stay here? - No. He comes from Ganeshmohalla. It's Shashti, the day after. Will your job be over by then? Yes. It'll be over. Come. Let's go to your room. Were you there when Maganlal came? Yes. I was in my room. - How long was he here? Around a half hour. Were you at home? - Yes. What where you doing? I was listening to music. Radio? - Yes, classical. Which station? - Lucknow. Since when are you here? - Since years. From '57. Do you like it? - I've got used to it. I think you're aware of your weak position. There's nothing to be aware of. I'm no one here. Just seeking shelter in Ghosh's house. Had I had any interest in the Ganesha... ...then I could've done so, a long time back. I've had no recent developments requiring any money as such. Has that happened to anybody else? Forgive me. I won't be able to comment on this matter. If commenting on that improves your position... ...then refusing to comment, would be foolish. Don't forget. You had both the reason... ...and the opportunity to steal. Reason? - Freedom from staying here. If you have anything to say, then say it. Deciding whether it's true or false is my duty. Mr. Ghoshal's business isn't going well. You'll come to know of it, if you investigate. And you also have that opportunity. Bikash! Tea! C'mon. Is everything alright? - Yes. Everything's fine. The salt, spice, etc... - I didn't know that... ...you could get such a huge fish in Kashi! I've arranged for it with great difficulty, sir. Don't give up, at least as long as we are here. And yes! Don't worry if your job doesn't end... ...within 10 days. I've already booked 3 beds for you. Thank you. But the job will end in 10 days... ...else it never will. No! Don't say such a thing, in Kashi, that too, in my... ...Calcutta lodge, one of your adventures should be remembered. Let's see. He isn't saying anything. Despite the presence of Jatayu... ...Captain Spark took away his attention. How can he refuse that? - You're right. It means that you aren't the only... ...popular detective novelist in the country. You've a rival. Yesterday's brat! The one that stays in Darjipada. He writes under a synonym. I wrote an edition in 3 days... ...and he hasn't finished one in 3 months. Is he the creator of the character Spark... If he gets an idea, then a spark flashes from his forehead. Understood? You've got a phone call, shall I ask him... ...to call back after 10 minutes? - No. I shall attend to it. Is this Mitra? - Yes. - I'm Maganlal Meghraj. Oh! Greetings! I saw you at the ashram of Machlibaba yesterday. How did you recognize me? I have my own methods. There're people to show me. I can understand that. What are you doing this afternoon? - Why? Come over to my place. I've something to talk to you about. But I don't know your house. Do you know Gyanvapi? - Yes. I know. My man will be at Gyanvapi. Blue shirt, his name's Manohar. He'll bring you along. But there'll be two more people with me. Your own people? - Yes, my own people. Then bring them along, too. I'm waiting. - Ok. Have you done the right thing? I haven't compelled you to come. No. I mean that meeting such a person, will it be suitable? That's why we've come. If he talks nonsense, then I shan't remain quiet. Why? - Who knows, what kind of a person he is. Oh God! Where are you? - I'm here. I'm in front of you. No. It's just that... - Sit. Sit on the mattress... ...or if you want, then on the sofa. I had a wish to meet you. I've heard of your job. Even I've heard of your fame. Why are you saying fame? Say defame, tell the truth. Is that boy your brother? - No. A cousin. My uncle's son. - And him? Uncle? - He's my friend. All are Lal! Bring cold drinks. We ate before we came. Lunch. So what if you've eaten? You've walked from that... ...Calcutta lodge to our house. That food must've gotten digested. What're you saying? - It's your wish. What shall I say? Have you come to Benaras for a holiday? That was my intention. - If that was your intention... ...then why did you change your mind? It's my mind, after all. Where's the restriction of changing it? There's no restriction, but why are you wasting your time? Go and visit the various temples. I've my own boat, you can visit all the 80 banks... ...and it won't cost you even a single penny. Your mind will be refreshed breathing... ...the air of the Ganges... ...instead of doing all this, why are you... ...wasting your time at the Ghoshal's house? You're forgetting that I'm a professional detective. Mr. Ghoshal has given me a job. The question of refusing it doesn't arise. What's your fee? - It depends on the job. It's Rs. 2000. Take the money and stop your job. I don't charge any money, without working for it. Work? What'll you achieve by working? You won't be able to do anything after catching the thief. Why? - The thief is your client, himself. What are you saying? Do you know that Mana Ghoshal has stolen the... ...Ganesha from his father's trunk... ...and sold it to me for Rs. 30000? Do you know how weak he is, financially? Do you know how much he has to repay? Will you go and tell his father that his son has stolen the... ...Ganesha from his trunk? He had refused you. He changed his mind, after refusing. After changing his mind, the next day... ...he gave me the idol at the ashram of Machlibaba. And I had given him 300 Rs. 100 notes. We visited the ashram, as well as did our job. That's it. You're an intelligent man, Mitra. Not ordinary intelligence, but extraordinary intelligence. If you come to know the truth... ...then it'll be a problem for both of us. So you take that money, and give up this job. This is my request. Then the Ganesha must be with you. - Yes. Can I see it? What are you saying, Mitra? My house in Calcutta was raided... ...why would I keep the idol in my house? To know whether you're telling the truth or not... I've to have a look at the idol first. Am I lying? The opposite of true is false, Maganlal. You do not believe my words? There's Rs. 2000 there. Take and enjoy your holidays. Take a tour with your uncle. I don't accept bribes, Maganlal. Then you'll continue with your work? Send for Arjun. Bring box no. 13. What, Halwamohan? Didn't you like the juice? Don't worry, Mohan. That juice isn't poisoned. I feel that poison is a very bad thing. Yes. Poison is useful for other things. A collection of knives! Are you feeling well? - Just a little fever. It's alright. - Will you perform today? Have you seen knife throwing, sir? The king of Harbanspur had a private circus. The knife thrower of his circus now performs in mine. Ok then, shall we go? - Where will you go? It's already 2.30... - So what? You've to rest a bit. - No! First, Arjun... ...will perform, only then will we go. Are you ready? - Oh yes! - Then start. Come, Uncle. - What is your intention? Uncle stand in front of the board, and Arjun will perform. What do you think of yourself? Hey fool! I shall break your bones! I had told you to shoot, only when he pulled out his pistol... ...who told you to shoot now? Forgive me, sir. - Is this your aim? I'll penalize you for this mistake. - Forgive me, sir. I made a mistake. Two pistols, two bullets have been pointed at you. Don't dare to disobey me! By not believing me, you've insulted me. If you be obedient today, then nothing will happen. Not even to Uncle. But if you investigate Ghoshal's house again... ...then I won't be able to guarantee your safety. I'm clearly warning you. Get up, Mohan! Get up! What happened? Just a minute. Let me drink the juice. What have you added to the juice? I'm feeling amazingly strong. Arjun, are you ready? - Yes. Where do I have to stand? Here? - Yes. There. Means, here? - Yes. Just a minute. Here, take my watch. My wallet. Ready Arjun? - Yes. Just a minute. Just a minute. Hail Baba Vishwanath! Wow! That's great! You're a lion! Amazing! Good! Your salary will be increased! Great! Wow! Look at it! I had told you, Mitra. Arjun is excellent! Uncle! Come out. The game's up! Come out! Lalan Uncle! Get some milk and nuts for Uncle. How much? - What's it normally, for you? 72. - Then it has to reduce by 25 more. It'll reduce now. Immediately reduce. I'm feeling relived now. Understood? A lot! I'm so relieved now! My head was bursting. You hadn't seen it. It was like living 5 lives in one. They don't say it for no reason... ...that truth is stronger than fiction. Go ahead with the case, I'm with you. What happened? Hello? Are you planning to give up? I'm responsible for what happened to you, today. No! What are you saying! This is just my fate. It's written in my fate. But I'm still alive! Hale and healthy! Forget what happened, today. Either I'll take revenge for this... ...or I'll give up my profession. What happened? Are you leaving? You've a show, the day after. What happened? This is dangerous, sir. I can't stay here any longer. What happened? - Don't ask. See. Beware! From where did you get this? It was near the window. Someone must've left it. Are you afraid of such threats!? You would've known, had you been in my place. This is a police case. Who wants to get involved in it? You've a 17.5 inch tricep... - Bicep! And you're afraid of this ordinary threat? You aren't able to understand the matter. I'm not a coward. - Then why are you leaving? Have you seen Angelo's David? That one? That's something great. Our body is a work of art. A temple. And the muscles on that are the designs. Did you hear that? - Amazing. Did you understand? - Means you've to take care of your temple. Isn't that so? - I can tell you one thing. You aren't the one who has been threatened. I've been threatened. Your introduction? His is about this. About mind and intelligence. He isn't into building muscles here and there. Am I right? I guarantee on thing to you. Even if something happens here. Your body will be safe. - What are you saying? 100% true. Don't feel afraid. - But don't let the Bengali club sink. Everyone sees the Bishwanath temple in Kashi. But how many see the Bishosri temple? A bowl full of blood. Did you think of mother Durga as an ordinary woman? She hurls the trident into his chest, and blood spurts out. Yes. Did you call for me? Sit. I hadn't told you something. As it can't be said. But I'm telling it to you. That day, even if I hadn't seen someone entering the house... ...I had seen one leaving. He was a gentleman. There just two gentlemen in this house, me and Bikash, Father. You have hidden your conversation with Maganlal from me. Maganlal had offered you money... ...I came to know about it through someone else. I didn't feel that it was important for you to know that. Maganlal had asked for the Ganesha, but I had refused him. However if it gets proved that... ...you had opened my trunk... ...then the appropriate punishment for that... ...you have to face it. Maganlal hasn't got the Ganesha yet. He hasn't!? Had he got it, then he wouldn't have offered me so much... ...money to stop my work. - Then where's the Ganesha? I believe... the Ganesha is still in Ghoshal's house. That means Umanath hasn't sold it? Umanath, had he stolen it, wouldn't... ...have recommended us to his father. And Raxit? - Had Bikash stolen it... ...then he wouldn't have stayed here. That's right. But where did the Ganesha go? Who opened the trunk, why did he do so... ...and why is Maganlal interested in that idol... ...only mother Ganga knows about it, till now. Mr. Mitra! How are you? - Fine. How are you? Fine. I heard that you've started... ...working, even after coming here? - What to do? There's no one... ...to pay us a salary. We've to keep doing something. Will you drink tea? - Yes. Tell me. - Will you take my advice? First, let me hear what the advice is. Have you heard of Maganlal? Not only have I heard of him... ...I spent an hour with him yesterday. What? You didn't tell me about it. He showed me the performance of his private circus. Offered me a drink. What's your opinion? - An extraordinary scorpion. Do you know? There was a theft in Benaras, a few days back... ...in Mr. Badrinarayars house. A Nataraj idol. And Maganlal had been to that house, 4 days before the theft. Then what? Search his house, you'll get the idol Maganlal isn't such a foolish person. Is it your intention to promote his cunningness? Forget about the threat to my life, just tell me... ...will I get your help, when I need it? You know that. You've seen it before in Allahabad. Lakhan! Take this. It's 10:30. - Were you thinking of eating out? No. It's the bylanes of Kashi. A historical feeling. Moreover, I just wanted to feel the cold atmosphere. C'mon. Is there any African king in any of your stories? - Yes. Gorillar Gograj. In it, King Mahanto. - What? Have you brought a gorrilla from there? That's nothing. Read my latest book... ...you won't get a chance to look up. What? How is the story? Excellent! Especially, the part where he hides the diamond. He steals a huge diamond, and hides it in the front... ...I mean, the front portion of his robe, with cellotape. Can't it be seen, even when he moves? That's the technique, sir. Even people are shocked on seeing him. And this man sees the stone, and as soon as he does... Excellent! I would've been happy, had there been any noise. This is too lonely. Has your stock of courage lessened? No! Do you know what the problem is? I have the courage. But not the muscle. Bagchi's biceps. He has a lot of it, but doesn't have courage. Courage is a very special quality. Are you going home? I'm going because you're here. Otherwise, in this street at night? Have a look at those courtyards, every house is haunted. Go inside, and you can see bats hanging from the ceiling. I won't be surprised if I see a vampire. The bat says that you'll see something amazing tonight. Tonight, bats and vampires shall come, and everyone will die. Sir! The Ghoshal house has no connection with the death of Shashi. He has been murdered by his son. It's such that the son had gone for a movie at late hours. There was a cold war going on between the father and the son. In fact, it's being said that the son had... ...even threatened his father. I feel that if I pressure a bit, then the truth will come out. Don't mistake me. But after your arrival... ...the crime rate in Kashi has increased. There has been a murder in Chaukammatha, yesterday. What's needed now, is just a brain wave. You don't believe in all this, sir. Just take a dip in the river... ...tomorrow morning, you'll see that your brain has been cleared. I didn't believe in it for 30 years. I was troubled by gastritis. Allopath, homeopath, jinxes... ...ayurveda, I didn't miss anything. Then I thought one day, what's the harm in trying it? Then I woke up at 5, and had a dip. That's it. Faith has an effect to some extent, not in everything. Is there any program? - Yes. Akhtar's music show. Is it today? - No. It was supposed to be on Saturday... ...singers were supposed to come from Lucknow. Don't you change the towels? What happened? You're looking tense. Won't you have your breakfast? I'm being drawn towards one thing. Drawn!? Africa's king, Shashi's and Akhtar's song. Huh! The dot, the cat's hobby, and Gopal's mother. Is that 'Singh', a Punjabi surname, or a Bihari surname? Or is it the horn of a cow, goat, deer, or anything else? What's the first thing that hits your mind on hearing of Africa? Jungle. - And jungle? - Animal. And king of animals? Where's Rukku? He isn't to be seen. He has been sitting in the room on the terrace, since morning. Why? - The idol was being established, and he tripped over it. And naturally it was... I've brought a revolver, won't you see? Where's the revolver? - Open the door, and I'll show it to you. Here, see it. This is a real revolver. Its name is Colt. It has 6 bullets. The king of Africa is the vehicle of Goddess Durga, the lion. And you have hidden the Ganesha in the lion's mouth... ...with chewing gum. Isn't it so? - Else, Gondariya would've taken it away. He had told father that he would take it way. Gondariya is Captain Spark's enemy. You had heard it. - Yes. - What happened after that? After that, I went to Raxit. Raxit, a man has come, downstairs. He's saying that he'll buy your Ganesha. He's saying that he'll buy it? - Yes. Who is that? - Dacoit Gandariya alias Maganlal. He's talking to Father. He'll give him a lot of money. He's saying that he'll give a lot of money? It isn't sounding good, Captain Spark. C'mon. Let's hide the Ganesha. Where do we hide it? That day, you told me a story that a man had hidden a... ...diamond, within his crocodile skin dress. Similarly, we, too, will hide it in the mouth of the lion. Lion!? - The vehicle of Goddess Durga. - Ok. And if he asks you, then tell him... ...that it's with the king of Africa. Ok. - And we shall remove it on the day of the immersion. Else, it'll sink along with the idol, into the deep waters. Did you hear the old man's antics? - Yes. I did. But the one who is acting behind your back... - What? Let me introduce him to you. Know him. No one's imagination can match that of his. He's the writer of 'Kamal Kanya', Jatayu. Jatayu! Are you Jatayu? He's just exaggerating things. I'm nothing of that kind. Then, my Ganesha was saved because of you. But the Ganesha isn't there. - What? There's nothing in the lion's mouth. Only the chewing gum is there. You had called for me, to catch the thief, isn't it? That's true. There was nothing in the trunk... ...when the thief came. But we've to see who fiddled with my trunk. The one who has the wrong intentions. Not only wrong intentions, but he has also taken wrong actions. I had sent Bikash to buy sweets. - Where? You can find him, if you go, now. What do you think? - About what? About Bikash's status. - Bikash is a lion. Tell me, Mitra. Where? Ram temple? Ok. Alright. Good morning. I was searching for you. Me? - I had to talk to you about something. - Now? It's important. It can't be told here. Let's find a lonely place. But, I was... - You can buy the sweets later. C'mon now. We shall come back. - Ok. The thing tickling your hips, is a fire weapon. Don't try to escape! Sit. The one whose lie has been caught, he can't be trusted anymore. You weren't listening to the radio that day. You were listening to Maganlal's conversation. Isn't it so? Tell me. Tell me what happened next. If you lie, you'll get trapped further. Speak up. Maganlal saw that I was listening to him, secretly. After that? - He sends for me the next day. He gives me an advance of Rs. 500. Says that he'll give me another Rs. 500 if I steal the Ganesha. And a job in Kolkata. I don't have any future here. Believe me! - After that? What happened after that? I opened the trunk, but the Ganesha wasn't there. Then, last evening, I was in my room at that time, suddenly... I haven't committed any sin, sir. I swear on God. Believe me! - Where did you get it? It was... it was in front of the idol. On the floor. I don't know who kept it there. This... give this to Mr. Ghoshal. I went to Maganlal with the Ganesha, that very night. Sit. Where did you get this? It was in front of the idol, in our house. I didn't find it. - You didn't find it? Shashi Babu. - Shashi Babu? Our sculptor, he gave it to me. He won't tell anyone. He's a very good person. Moreover, he isn't that kind of a person. Where is he now? He is a very good man. I mean, coolheaded. He is about 70 years old. Where is he now? In his house? Do you know his house? I won't be able to... I know what you can do and what you can't. You just show it to us, the rest will... ...be taken care of by someone else. I haven't committed the murder. Believe me, Mitra. I haven't committed the crime. It would've been alright hadn't you told about that. You wouldn't have been able to do that thing. Come, Tiwari. As of now, he's your guest. He's just a part of the plot. There're many more to come. Come. Come with me. Is this that thing? - Yes. Tell me the spelling. Now write, deltoid. Wow! Is it deltoir? - No. Deltoid. Its 'd' not 'r' ? - No. Call for you? - For me? Listen, you've some work to do. Listen carefully. This evening at 5, you and Jatayu... ...will come to Machlibaba's ashram. Exactly at 5. - And you? - I'll meet you. It's something serious. - I've understood. And at around 3, a member of the Bengali club, Shushanto Ghosh... ...will visit your place with makeup and dresses. - Ok. And take care that Lal Mohan doesn't act over smart. It's something serious. And bring something to eat. I haven't eaten anything all day. I understand, but... Hail Shiva! What's this? - Eatable. He'll come on time. Keep quiet. Look back. You've just seen a bullet, Maganlal. But you haven't seen a noose. Arrested! - You've been caught red-handed! Now, you've to see the performance of my private circus. How much money do you want? How much? Tell me. Those who kill innocent people, with the help of thugs. Those who eat out of the treasures of the country. They won't be freed, by coughing up money. Come, Mr. Tiwari. - Come, Mr. Meghraj. Here, I've given my autograph. - Ok. I shall send two more books after reaching Kolkata. Do you know him, dear? - Who? He's Captain Falu's assistant. What's the name? - Captain Taxit. I understood all that. But why hasn't Captain Falu arrived yet? He'll come. He'll come within an hour or two. He has to change his dress, and remove the makeup. But he doesn't go back on his word. But I haven't come to know whether... ...I got back the Ganesha or not. - Are you still unsure? Don't misunderstand. I got delayed... ...as I had to attend to another job. Here, take your Ganesha. - Ganesha! Thanks God! What you showed, can only be read in books. Will you let me see it? - Here, have a look. You're incomparable. Let me put it back in its place. - Yes. It's an old treasure of mine. Go back to your house. Go back to your house, O Lord! Let us have some sweets to celebrate. I've work. You'll refuse if I give you anything more than your fees. Before you write the check, I would... ...like to show you something else. You can. Why do you need permission for that? Then see. See carefully. Here, I opened the garage. This is the key. Now, I open the trunk. Here's the result of my action. What was your action? You may be reading a lot of detective novels... ...but I'm a detective myself. It isn't easy to fool me. I've investigated. The price of this can't be more than Rs. 1000. Had this been the real Ganesha, then you wouldn't... ...have hidden it in the lion's mouth, along with your grandson. Am I right? - You're a genius. Your actual Ganesha is in the bank, isn't it? Yes. Of course. Everyone wants to see it. And I've to open the trunk for that, every time. It's such a costly thing. A work of art. Did you hear it, Captain Spark? Your grandfather had hidden the actual Ganesha. That's why, I'm taking this fake Ganesha. Ok? Is this the fruit of your actions? - Yes. My fruit. What do you say? You're a genius. The one who's so intelligent... ...he can't be fooled easily. But how did you get it? - I know. By his intelligence. Synchronisation by Subransu
