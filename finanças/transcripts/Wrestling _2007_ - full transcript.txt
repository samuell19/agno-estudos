Wrestling Einar... I can't do this anymore. We're booked for wrestling next weekend. You have to find someone else. You must choose Einar. Either it's me or her. Denni? BIoody nonsense. Denni... Denni boy? - How was it? - Good. Will you empty the bottle for me? She's finished. How is the drilling going? Good. Someone on the radio said that more tunnels are coming. Up North, in the West... I guess in the end we'II have a tunnel all the way to Reykjavik. It makes it easier for people to get around. It makes it easier for them to Ieave!. Well, well, Grettir... How are you doing, big boy? I ordered a truck today. Huh? For Grettir. - Without telling me? - I am telling you. You don't do this without talking to me first! He is four years old. He should have been slaughtered a Iong time ago. That's up to me! If you want a pet, get a dog or something... - Fucking nonsense! - Watch your mouth, Einar! I curse whenever I want! Denni? The retirement home wrote to us. It's overcrowded. No room for you until next year. AII right then. Guys! We broke through! We made it, guys! We broke through! Mum! We broke through. Mum? Ashes to ashes, dust to dust... The National Wrestling Championship is coming up? Yes. It will be quite a match? Yes. You will fight, won't you? Excuse me, Peter, I need to... AII right, buddy. Can I sit? Yes. - My condolences, Denni. - Thanks. - You want to wrestle next week? - I quit wrestling. What? I sold the Iand. I'm moving to the city. What are you going to do there? I don't know. Get a job. And you? Are you just staying here? Yes. That's just how it is. Don't Ieave me alone. - Come with me then. - I can't. - Don't you Iove me? - Yes, I Iove you! Dad. I spilled on my dress. Sigtryggur won. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm delighted to announce that the national champion Denni has decided to join us. His first fight will be against... Einar Bergp?rsson. You can do it, Einar! Throw him down! Take your positions. Begin!
