So, what now? This is it? What happened to being together forever? We never imagined that "forever" would be like this. FINDING TOGETHER What's gonna happen? I don't know. Several countries are already under lockdown. Well, everything remains the same here. They detected the first case today. What a way to celebrate our first month. Eddie, what if they lock us up? How long do you think it will be? I do not know. As far as I know, only a couple of weeks. Well, the advertising agency where I work They bought us all laptops to work from home. They see it for long. With my partner in the gym we're deciding if we do video classes. But we are far from the capital, so I don't think it's going to affect us. Don't say that. Why? Because I don't want you to go. I know. And I don't want to go. Well, don't go. Seriously? You better go. You obviously want to go. Do you think it's easy for me to drop everything and come live with you here, Byron? I lost my gym, I'm paying debts I am helping my family and still being here with you. Well I just see you on the phone all day, laughing and chatting while I'm literally breaking my back working. Not only did they cut my salary in half, they doubled my workload. Do you understand that? I know! And I see you working there until dawn and I don't know how to help you. But the few virtual clients I have are not enough. This was all a bad idea. What do you mean? Say it. Eddie, just... these five months have been complicated. And I... Say it. What do you want me to say? I love you. What did you say? Sorry! Is it too early? No, no, no. I've wanted to tell you since March, but I didn't want to scare you. It was also when they put us in lockdown and I didn't know if this was going to work at a distance. Say it. I love you. I love you. I want us to be together forever. Forever is impossible. Apparently. How's the new job? Boring. Stupid. But at least it helps me pay the bills. At least you have a job. There are many people who can't find one. Byron, I have a bachelor's and master's degree in exercise physiology, 10 years of experience and I am selling appliances. I mean… Sorry. I'm frustrated. That's all. Sorry. Sorry. And how about the move? Well. They've already come to take the boxes and the big furniture. In a couple of hours I hand over keys and I go out for a run one last time. Like old times. Yes. Are you okay? Well, yeah. What they charge for rent here is it's absurd. It's very pretty. It was prettier when you were here. Now it's just Empty. What happened? The apartment feels empty. Byron doesn't want to be alone. No. Besides all the lockdown has me scared me. I don't know when I'll see you again. Every day. I'm going to call you day and night. I know. But I want a kisses. And other things. You're naughty. I have to go. They don't let cars circulate after 6. Call me when you get there? Don't open it now. I open it when I arrive. Welcome home! I was dying to see you. 5 months' too long for me. Well, let's not waste any more time. But I left some things in the car. Let's go. C'mon c'mon! I want to see that energy. Almost there. I want to see you sweat. That's right! That's the attitude. Let's go. Up, up. Down. Up. With a smile. That's right. Let's go. With everything, everything. What we are? What are we? Champions. That's it. Let's do it. Good Morning. I'm sweaty. How did it go? Bad. I only have three clients left and with that I can't even pay the phone. And what happened? People are tired of being locked up, they no longer want to pay for virtual classes and I don't blame them. It's not the same to do dumbbell weights to a bag full of books. What else can be done? I don't know. And I don't want to continue being a burden to you than I already am. But, we agreed to be together forever. ¿No? And what if "this" is forever? I love you. The distance is sometimes very cruel but it never will be for those brave dreamers who are sure of their passion. The day means nothing without you by my side But when night falls I will dream that I am next to you. Until I can finally hold you in my arms my dreams will have to take me. It doesn't matter that we are far away we will find how to be together.
