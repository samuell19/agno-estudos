Reality interests me less than truth. That's why I take pictures. I took this picture inside a dream. My body was gone. All my organs were one. I had become the underlying reality. I was made of stars. My body was made of stars. Oh, my God. Are you Ava Gastpunkt? I am. And who are you? Me? Me? I'm nobody. Um, pleased to meet you, Miriam Annabelle. Got my hands full. Um, you know, I wrote my senior thesis on you at McGill, I think you're one of the most interesting female photographers since Diane Arbus or-- or Nan Goldin or-- I don't know why I just said that. Do you think of Diane Arbus? I don't particularly enjoy it when people call me "female photographer." You know, for the same reason Chantal Akerman refused to be labeled a "queer filmmaker." Intersectionality. It's like somebody hand the anarchist a cigarette. I'm just a photographer, man. Can I photograph your vulva? N-- no, wait. I mean-- I mean, what? This is on tape. The tape-- The Pentagon is gonna rise into the air. When it gets about 300 feet in the air, it's gonna start to vibrate. Slowly at first, and then a little quicker. ...LSD. The water filtration... Uh, not even in movies, it's human behavior. It's human behavior. Landon. This is a Ava. Ava, Landon. - Is he your boyfriend? - Sort of. He doesn't like being called it. -It's too institutional. -Hi. Landon hasn't been able to sleep for three weeks. It's a medical condition, but he refuses to see a doctor. Even though his rich parents would pay for it. His father is always on TV. Wait. What? Mm-hmm. That's right. Always on TV. My brain is made of rainbows. Curiouser and curiouser it gets. Instead of sleeping, Landon watches tapes of the '68 DNC. He's trying to find VHS evidence of the phantom. Isn't that right, you fuck? What phantom? The phantom who runs America. Conjured by the Founding Fathers. His large black cape surrounds us. Blocks out the true sun. His illusion, fabric of media... beyond the simulacra. Oh, my! Look! Right there. What's that? What do you see? Um, money? It's an eye. Yeah. But whose eye? What eye? Where? Where's that eye? I see an eye... inside my dreams. You see an eye in your dreams? I see one eye. This eye. Watching me. I see space in my dreams. That means you're really aliens. Have you seen my cat? What? Los Angeles cryptozoologist. He's a sasquatch. That one he is. I felt that his heart was full of sasquatch. Like, I hear his little heart. I just saw that... little heart full of sasquatch. LA crypto-Z is not a real job. That is because I don't have a job. I thought that's what we were working on here, Emma. What does social integration means in a disintegrating society? Why do you come here? D-- don't touch that. - Sorry. - It's okay. Thanks. So, next Wednesday, my wife's having minor surgery. Can we do Thursday at... seven? Hello! I am Sir Reginald St. Clair. Officer of the most excellent order of the British Empire, and I will be your host on this most magical journey. We'll go here and there and everywhere! LA! Land of a million magic tricks, dreams, and illusions. Mirrors, castles, chandeliers! Habitats wherein we can find the most curious of life forms. Shh! Make not a sound. What creature have we here? Why it's Principal√≠a Cordyceps, otherwise known as the young and important regular female. Unknown is her source of income and vast potential. Oh, my, where was I? What made you decide to learn Japanese? I want some. - It's fun. - You like it? It looks toxic. Isn't that a good thing? What are these? I don't know. Mm! My heart was turned away as well. Mm. It's bone marrow. What flavor did you just say? It is... -it's... -Bone marrow? ...bone marrow, and, like, something. Smoked cherries. Uh... Fuck! Shh! Hello, Mom. Merry Christmas. What do you mean it's not Christmas? - Mr. Max! - Mr. Max! Richard Max. It's him! Richard Max! Sign my book! Yeah, I'm Richard Max. Yeah. Know what's going on right now? Richard Max. Tell us, what is the secret? The secret is now. Oh, my word. Women? God created women. And then? She slept. The rest is history. Cryptique. Richard Max. Richard Max. What does it feel like to be the biggest celebrity? What? What the fuck? You see, what people don't know about me, but I know about me, is I'm real. Real dumb? The real thing. Maybe dumb, but better than non-real. Most people, most famous people, are really non-real. Or really think they are. Same thing. I'm not. But you're just a novelist. But listen... I-- I... oh, well, uh, don't-- don't-- don't fake it, just be real. Lay the real thing on me, okay? Don't fake it. Books are, well, what was I saying? Mm, books-- well, what was I saying anyways, um, books are movies anyway. Or movies are real life anyways. Before real life happens. Next comes books. So, I, uh, I've read a lot of '80s thrillers, and I watched a lot of '80s thrillers. Most of my books are '80s thrillers. I'm-- I'm a meme. What are you? I don't know. Name? Molly Bianca. Pleased to meet you. Unattainable career goals? To be a flower. The shape of the universe. That tickles. Three, two, one. Hold on. How did this happen? Is this another Molly Bianca mythology? More tall tales and holiday superhero antics from the heart of-- and mind of the city's most beloved bizarro. What's a bizarro? It's, like, you're a superhero, who walked into a radioactivity tank, and you came back out totally insane. Like, more insane than you. Like... you died, and you couldn't get out. And way more insane than me? No, you're-- you're way more insane than LA. Your heart is an exact replica copy of LA. Upside down. Adjusting focus. Fresh. Rolling. Action. Science has confirmed the quantum mechanics of Molly Bianca's heart. An exact particle of Los Angeles. Identical in every attribute, a perfect simulacrum of the desert of the real. Her organism, a formation of the hyper real, vestiges of no origin. The fiction is Los Angeles. A procession of imaginations transformed. As they hear the substance of dreams and ghosts, known only as Hollywood. Look! There she is now. No! Put it out or I shall dissolve. Who are you? Who am I, indeed. I was Hollywood once. Champagne and chandeliers, tears and tiaras... moonshine all gone like poof. I was a star once. I was. I was going to do the talkies. Are you a poltergeist or something? Or something? More like nothing. Not even a has-been. More like a once-was. Dead. Dead. The dormouse said. I thought it said, "Feed your head?" It did? Oh, fuck! What's the matter, babe? More dreams? What are you doing? What is that? Babe? Babe? I was a star. I became a symbol. That sounds like a dream come true. Not. I could feel myself s-- slowly tearing to shreds. Internally. From the inside. A vast furnace of atoms churning. I was a storm. This isn't a track off Tusk, babe. I met a very interesting guy the other day. He said it means something, dreams. But, like, I feel like a person when I dream. Not a person, but a phantasm, who used to be a person, transformed to light. Lost in galaxies. A memory of a person. Hmm, couldn't follow up to the transformativality. Do you think it's possible that our souls... augment with other souls when we dream? So, a brief discourse on rent, babe. Behold, Anastasia Valeriax. Somewhat of a reclusive rock star with consistent ratings, a laptop recording studio, and an income less than subprecariate, despite a substantial following in Europe and the Pacific Northwest. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, fire! She'd been forced to take a second job. Situated here as a forest ranger, stationed in Griffith Park. Curious destiny. Left to hang out in nature and think about music. There it was. Inside the outside. A noise escaped in the insect kingdom. Crystal ringing, logic of the Moon. The telekinesis of a leaf. High vibes of the rainbow. Anastasia understood the twisted logic of the spinsters named "fate." And she found her own music in every place. No, no, no. Too sentimental. That's not what you're supposed to say, this is a televised nature program, Reginald. Think TV. -Oh, hi. -Hi. Uh, I'm just peeling this orange. I know. Is something the matter? No, I'm just walking around. It's my job to walk around and make sure everything's okay. In nature, with the people, everything. Want a piece of fruit? Um, well, okay. Are you Anastasia Valeriax? Wait, you know who I am? When you were five did you ever think you'd be where you are right now? - No, dude. - Come on, man. I mean, I guess we couldn't have predicted, like, the Internet and all that. - Right. I mean-- - It's just... I wasn't thinking about the Internet when I was five except for to play, like, - video games or something. - Yeah, but... I don't know, man. I don't understand, I mean, look at it. Yeah, I know. We were at Wesleyan, and I was like, "I'm gonna do this," you know? Like, really commit. I'm gonna do it cool, you know? Like, make it neat. -Yeah. The music. -Music. I mean, I know musicians don't always make a ton of money, except for licensing, if that, -but... -Right. - ...I was committed. - Right. Look where it got me. -Put it on. -Fuck you, no. You put it on. That looks good, man. -Thanks. -One more thing. Oh, yeah get that. Get that hair out of there. -That looks good. -What do you think? Yeah? Yeah, you look like you can prevent forest fires. Let's go freaking... - save the forest. - Okay. Infinity, are you still there? Witch-speak, James, my boy. It's witch-speak. Gee. Witch-speak. The language is from the lower Ural Mountains, but it's a particularly Los Angeles dialect. I recognize that voice. Ah-ha! Here it is. Wait a minute. You recognize the voice on that tape? 1979. Outside the haunted village of , Prefect A29B. Soviets were inflicting damage on the mud fortifications of the local witch armies. But wait. I thought history erased the witch wars. Oh, here it is. That's when I met her. 792 years old. She never-- she never told me her name. But she told me this. Wait. I recognize that voice. Infinity. She can be the greatest discovery of the 21st century. And then I ate its soul. Gave him a little-- a little face. Three, tango, zero, one, three to bravo, Zulu, eight, eight, over. It's Mike! How'd he get here? Code name, Nova Waves. Hello, Infinity, can you hear me? This moral decay weakened... Can you hear me, Infinity? I'll be coming in loud and clear. Leave me alone! ...the significance of the extreme... Nova Waves leaves. As anyone here can see-- Dry cat food! Here everything is regulated by machines. You'll find that things are very different here. Leave me alone! I was in love with her. Continue, please. In a full moon... she would behave in a very strange way. Professionally I wonder... ...that after a certain time-- I didn't have a place to think-- ...can cause a cycle of a physical transformation-- My colleagues-- I was successful with the-- The pituitary gland and our psychocontrols-- ...transformation, a girl who-- There's not a vaccine in the world that can stop it. Code name, Nova Waves. That's why it is imperative for you to develop a vaccine against it immediately. Mr. President... There's a virus... Might've been in a better position to develop... ...observatories as far away as Siberia and Beijing. - Todd! - Vicky! Are you all right? Stop it! Shut up! Get out of my head! Things like that scare me. That's enough. Look at that. - Oh, wow! - Wake up. Did I say something wrong? No, but you just reminded me I'm supposed to go into town tomorrow. There's a NASA exhibit at the university-- But you can't speak German... I can't, that's why I have to ask you. Do you hear them too? Infinity. Can you hear me, Infinity? Where are you? How did you find me? Leave me alone, it's not working! Stop! Stop! I have someone here who very much wants to meet you. It-- it's Mr. World Leader Man! I have your instructions. I first started hearing voices in my head last week. Mainly guys talking. Dirty talking about their wives. Sometimes they'd stop playing cards and they'd talk to me. Or about me. They're using microwaves to put their voices inside of my head. They-- they have a secret lair... in the Santa Monica mountains. I can't. I can't. My doctor says I'm fine. I looked it up on the Internet. I'm not alone. You are not alone. Who's next? Halifax Kryptek. KX1000 for short. From the year 2257. You are not alone. This is my beast years. H-- he follows me, he does. Here and there. Th-- through a portal I formed. He-- he looks at me through the window and... and then I wake up and he's... he's... You are not alone. You are not alone. You are not alone. You are not alone. Bat people. Bat people and children. They see me. They have huge, green laser eyes, their eyes don't see in the dark... they see through the dark. Bat children raised in labs, made of soy... fly through the sky... look through my roof... see me in bed. After the helicopters, they go... Like that. Behold, exhibit A. Time machine contraption. I found this one washed up on the cave on the beach outside a house in Carmel near where the dirigible went down in '83. I restored it. You can see clear straight through to this location in 1945. The first time myself from 1873 tried to kill me in Dresden with a musket out a hotel room window. This spot in space and time was Dresden, due to the earth's rotation. Orgasm laser. Massive orgasm technology, transmitted via ham radio from MK High. It's where they program olympiads using dolphin telepathy in-- in Brentwood. Do you know that school? Yeah. Class of '89. Go Dolphins! Yeah, I, uh, I'm pretty sure they work for the school paper, like, special forces, IOPS, or something. They're giving me, uh, pretty bad orgasms. Um, usually when I'm in traffic, or commuting from work. They're huge, and I don't know how they find me. It's like-- like... What? Who, me? Yes, you. Take it. Come on. Go on, little one. Go on. Find your way. Can you hear my voice inside your mind? Magic vitamins. Take me on a magical journey. Take me on a magical journey. Can you feel psychic, LA? Can you feel psychic now, LA? So, you're okay? Even though the pills don't help anymore? She used to experience mass reflex taxonomia, parasomnia, somnambulation. Higher knowledge, differentiated behaviors. Modulated in moon patterns. Gigasmic non-corporeal contact with illuminated beings of a higher exoplanetary order. Subscript. Subject's eyes are nearly always totally closed. Went into thematic spasmic patterns. Corporeal organization materializes. Totally suppressed by the meds, by the way. But the meds don't seem to be working so great anymore, eh, doc? We're up the river with Brando. Personal aside from me to you, strictly liminal. I saw a cloud shaped like the future today. And a... princess. How heteronormatively monogamous of you. Look. Have you found your cat? This one. That's my favorite scene. This one. Oh, my God, that face. Beyond goddess. You're totally my favorite Hollywood star ever. Arcadia Harlowe, an exotic species of deceased silent film movie stars, who yet haunt Los Angeles. As can be seen... she's a real girl now. Magic. Oh, my God. That's Arcadia Harlowe. -Who? -Star of silent film in cinema. We have to go and put flowers on her star now. Is that a superstition or something? When you see a dead movie star in Los Angeles, you have to go and put flowers on her star. S-- see, it looks like her, but that's impossible. Holly. Holly. This is really happening. Happy New Year. At last, their arrival was complete. The bringers of the sun. She heard aliens talking in her guitar amp. She would never tell a soul. She knew magic. Aliens are coming, dummy. Can you hear me? This isn't a voice in your head. I'm you. Wake up. Wake up. They're here. What about that? Where did you get that? This one I got in a thrift store. It was just, like, sitting in the counter. The only thing is that, like, it turns my... -like, finger that green color. -Oh, like, green. Yeah, if you, like, paint the inside with nail polish. -Clear nail polish? -Yeah. I've heard that, I should do that. I'm gonna call you Little Claw. It didn't last long. They found her. All of it. All the horses, helicopters. I want to give you everything. You don't understand. Everything I've ever written... everything I've ever done, you'll tell them I did it. That I'm dead. That's it. Tell everyone. Tell the-- the papers. Tell America. Richard Max is dead. And then we'll run away together. That noise you just made. I just want to give you everything. What? Fake my death. You have to tell them. The Pope, America, the Internet, the trees, the leaves. Tell them I'm dead. We'll fake my net-- my death and be on the headlines. Richard Max is dead. And then, we'll run away together. Everything I've ever done... everything I've ever written... all the bestsellers I've topped, all the royalty checks in the mail... all the helicopters, the horses. All of it was nothing compared to you. Mm-hmm. And that sound you just made. I want to give you everything. What? They are here. Aliens are coming. The pituitary gland and our psychocontrols-- , he'll follow her. There's not a vaccine in the world that can stop it. Code name, Nova Waves. Targets acquired. Another day in paradise. Looks like we have a live one. A doctor! A doctor! What's that on her wrist? What, where? Here? A doctor! A doctor! Here? Curious. "Give me the pills in my pocket"? Oh, yes. The pills in my pocket. Give me the pills in my pocket. The pills in my pocket. Aliens are coming. Help! I feel like... Wait, I've been here before. -What is that? -It's my diamond. So magnificent. I can't believe it. Uh, wait. Wow. What is that? It's beautiful. It's cool. - I can see you. - I see myself. I feel like we're meant to be here. Fellow humans, get together. Did you know? Your eye! What are you? They left us a piece of their sky machine. Only we could see it. Reality interests me less than life. But is life no more than what's not there? And is what's not there really there? Because I'm not here. I'm not here. I'm not here. I'm not here.
