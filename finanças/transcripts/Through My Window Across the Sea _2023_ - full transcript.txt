[plane flying overhead] [light twinkly music playing] [door opens] [door shuts] I MISS YOU, WITCH. I MISS YOU TOO [locks phone] [boat horn honks] WHEN LOVE SETS SAIL ["When Love Sets Sail" by Amaia playing] - WANT TO TALK LATER? - SORRY. I HAVE PLANS PLANS? SO MYSTERIOUS YOU'LL SEE... [doorbell rings] - Raquel Mendoza? - Uh, yep. - Thank you. - You got it. ["When Love Sets Sail" by Amaia playing] [Ares in English] Can you hear me? We can study together if you want. WANT TO STUDY TOGETHER? IS THAT IT? You're going to have to imagine the rest yourself. Close your eyes. Pretend I'm right there. I'm walking into your literature class. And nobody else in the room can see us. ["When Love Sets Sail" by Amaia continues] [heavy breathing] [kissing] [Raquel breaking up] Ares? Are you still there? Ares? [phone beeps] [sighs] [exhales] [calm music playing] [church bells ringing] THROUGH MY WINDOW: ACROSS THE SEA [phone vibrating] [teacher] Many critics classify Cervantes as staunchly anti-establishment. And there's lots of evidence in Cervantes' work to support this claim. He's openly critical of politicians, companies, and established social structures. - MORNING - I'M IN CLASS The inclusion of a character like Marcela... WHAT ABOUT LATER? ...and insists that she was born free. I HAVE A SHIFT AT THE FAST FOOD PLACE! ...for the 16th century, we can agree he was well ahead of his time. Miss Mendoza, - unless you're texting Cervantes himself... - [laughter] ...I suggest you put down your cell phone. So you get your hand like this and you put the other one here. And you press. Does anybody know how many pressings are done before mouth-to-mouth? [phone locks] Ares? Can you answer my question, please? [Ares] It's easy to go with the flow when things are working out. [woman] Is it, um... [Ares] But then when things get tough... Excellent, thank you. [Ares] ...you just start to question everything. Thank you. Now, I suppose you don't remember the group B. [Ares] Is this where I want to be? Who I want to be? Am I good enough? Sometimes I wonder, who decided to study medicine? Was it me? Or was it the Ares I wished I was? Cheers! - [cheering] - Chug it! Chug, chug, chug! - Let's go, let's go, let's go! - [phone vibrates] YOUR BATTERY IS RUNNING LOW - 1% [woman] Hey, Ares! [sighs] AR3S - MISSED CALL [phone vibrating] [exhales] [locks phone] [Ares] These days, all I can think about is the distance between us. [indistinct chatting] [phone vibrates] [Ares] There's 1,200 miles between me and Barcelona... WITCH - CAN YOU TALK? ...between me and you. I can't stop asking myself if I'm on the right path or if I'm just going through the motions. I don't know. [breathes deeply] I can't tell you why I'm here or if I'll be able to keep going. I only know I need to see you. HEY - I MISS YOU - [shower running] - [woman humming] [breathes deeply] Literature is always an expedition to the truth. [phone vibrates] And the truth is exhausting. AR3S: ANY PLANS FOR SAN JUAN? [laughter] Anyway, that's the reason you all deserve a vacation. [cheering] Hey, hey, hey! But do me a favor, okay? Don't forget everything over the summer. Raquel Mendoza. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. It's a shame you spent the whole year looking at your phone in class. I'm sorry. It's a shame because you see, I would really prefer that the best students in my class were also my best writers. It's unfortunate that's not the case here. [sighs] Your manuscript, Through my Window, it's brilliant. Wish it wasn't. But it's brilliant. Here. This is the email of a publisher friend of mine. Send her your manuscript when you get home. Got it? Ah! And when you do meet with her, I wouldn't recommend taking your cell phone with you. [sighs] [Raquel] That's not very convincing, you know. I figured as much when they kicked me out of class. Hey, something really cool just happened. [gasps] At last, I can't believe it! You told Ares you want an open relationship? That's not actually what I want. If I burn all my notes on Dante at the San Juan party, you think there might be a circle of hell for that? You tell me. You're the one who's top of our class, right? But you're the better writer. You got plans for San Juan? I'm staying home. Wow. Straight to the final circle. I promised my mother I was going to stay with her and so, I'm staying with her. Yeah. Well, let me know if you change your mind or your excuses. See you in hell! So, about that guy, uh? What's going on with all that? There's nothing to know, Dani. That was like librarian porn. My God, Raquel. - You were flirting. - No. Your face is turning all red. Hey, Daniela. He's, um, a friend from class and that's it. He asked you to a party and you're acting like the boy proposed to you. Okay, but I don't want to go. You don't want to or the Raquel who's in love with her snobby neighbor doesn't want to? - Daniela. - I don't know what you see in Ares. - And who knows what he's been doing. - I just don't want to go, okay? - This Raquel. Me. - Hm. Whatever. This whole finding the man of your dreams for the first time and only being with him your whole life thing... Sorry, but it sounds crappy. You've been living your life through your phone. Going to one party with someone is not going to kill you. [calm music playing] [exhales] [exhales] - Aren't you gonna say hi? - [squeals] I... [upbeat romantic music playing] [chuckles] [Daniela] Yoshua! Come here! It's an emergency, I swear. I've been looking for you for half an hour. - Where's your phone? - What's up? Guess who's here. I don't know, the Spice Girls? Ares Hidalgo. What do we do, Yoshi? We have to just be there. - Like always. - There? Where? Daniela, wherever she needs. Okay? Okay. I can find where she's going to be. I have insider info. - Let's go. - No. - Get on, Daniela. Please. - The bike? - I thought you were in a hurry. - Okay, okay. Just be careful with me, okay? Oh, the handlebar is digging into my pussy. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Mm, I'll let you know in a minute. [laughs] [joyful upbeat music playing] [Raquel] Where are we going? [Ares] On a trip. [Raquel] I have work on Monday. [Ares] I start a summer intensive in Stockholm on Monday. [Raquel] Okay, so what then? I needed to see you. Even if just for a bit. I went by your place and I got you some clothes. [Raquel] Oh, was my mom home? Mm, nope. How'd you get in the house? Well, I'm pretty familiar with the windows at your place. [inhales] Alright. Leave your stuff here, okay? I'll open up downstairs. [strains] [latches opening] [Raquel] I don't think I've seen this girl before. Who is she? [Ares] Oh, that's Claudia. Her mom worked for us so we basically grew up together. [Raquel] She has red hair? [window rolls open] You coming? [seagulls caw] [calm music playing] The local San Juan festival's on Sunday. We can go if you want. The village is close by. Is this all an attempt to impress me? No. I didn't mean to. Mm. Do you have the Wi-Fi password? [whispering] We could take a swim. Mhm. First I have to send an email. Okay. Well, uh... Hm. [door slams shut] Hello? - I'm gonna see who else is here. - Okay. Hello? [exhales] [metal clinks] Hello. What um... [Ares] What are you doing here? [Artemis] I could ask the same of you. [knocking] - Hey! - Hey! My boyfriend invited us. [funky R&B music playing] Like this? [sighs] Hold on. Wait. [groans] Better? [exhales] Are you okay? [exhales] Yeah. Yeah, you? Yeah. I just think I'm tired. Yeah. Yeah, me too. I suppose it's normal when it's been a super long time. Yeah. Yeah. [seagulls cawing] What? You taste like me. - Yeah? - Yeah. Really? I really missed you. So much. Yeah. I think we drifted apart a bit these past few months so let's try and find each other again. Alright? Alright. It's hard for me to go on like this. - Like what? - You're hiding our relationship, Artemis. - [sighs] - I'm... [sighs] - It's absurd. - I'm not hiding anything. [knocking on door] [Apolo] Artemis? - [knocking on door] - Artemis? Artemis? [sighs] Your brother destroyed his room once again. Do you know where he is? No. No idea. Can I help you? [Apolo] I wanted to ask him for a condom. [sighs] Is one enough? You better take two or three. Okay. [Artemis sighs] [Claudia sighs] Do you think your brothers are stupid? - They obviously know about us. - Well, okay. Then what about it? [Claudia] Hiding our relationship is ridiculous. You know what my parents are like. You know how they raised us. I have a good idea of your childhood. I was there. Well... Well, maybe that's the problem. I work for your family. At night, I'm taking classes. I help my mom and I still find time to be with you. But if all I am to you is the help then it's clearly not worth being tired 24 hours a day. Wait, wait, wait. Hey. What can I do? Quit acting like a Hidalgo and be my boyfriend for once. If what we have is real then do something about it. This is real. It is. Is it? Are you sure? Yeah. I'm gonna do it, okay? [groans] [grunts] [calm music playing] How's school going? Didn't go to class. [Daniela] I've got pizza! And you? Get swim lessons yet? [Daniela] The half with the extra pepperoni's all mine. You could've drowned me. [Apolo] I'll eat whatever. One small scare for the Hidalgos but a giant leap for mankind. - [Apolo] It's so good. - [Daniela] Yeah. Pizza tastes better by the beach, don't you think? I'n so glad you came. [Daniela] Veggie, please. - Thank you. - Someone had to keep an eye on you. - Artemis has something to tell you. - Hm? [sighs] I, uh... [man] Somebody call the police! [laughs] A bunch of deadbeats are hanging around my property. [Ares] I thought you were flying out this morning. [Mrs. Hidalgo] The hotel in Greece is flooded so we came up. We saw you were here because of Apolo's social media feed. Hm. Oh. Bringing the help with you was a good idea. Claudia, a couple of glasses of cava to celebrate that we're together. - Hey, honey. - You want to have one? - That'd be great. - [Mr. Hidalgo] Ares? Ah, you know what, Claudia? Bring glasses for everyone. - [Daniela] Want water? - [Raquel] Yes, please. Who are you? The third wheel. TMW MANUSCRIPT SEND THIS EMAIL [phone vibrates] [sighs] [unlocks phone] I WOULD SEND IT IF I WERE YOU. IT'S AWESOME YOU READ IT? [phone beeps] OF COURSE. THE DAY YOU SENT IT. I'M YOUR AGENT Hm. IS THAT RIGHT? I HAD NO IDEA [phone vibrates] YES. AND I ADVISE YOU TO SEND IT. EXPECT TO SEE ME IN THE FRONT ROW FOR YOUR BOOK PRESENTATION THANKS FOR READING IT. NOT EVEN ARES HAS READ IT YET [calm music playing] [Yoshua] Boyfriends are temporary, but your friends will be there forever. You want some? Are we five years old now? Do you want some? Will it help me sleep? It'll help you think. [sighs] I'd forgotten the taste. How are things in Stockholm? [exhales] I don't know. I don't know. There's always a place for you at Alpha 3. You know that, right? Think about it. Hm? [upbeat joyful pop music playing] [Raquel] Hello? Anna. - Hello? - [rock music playing] [man] Sorry, we're not open yet. I just want to buy two bottles of water. Did you find a better excuse? How's your mom? You promised you'd spend the weekend with her, remember? Ah, yep. Staying nearby? Mhm. This weekend. [Gregory] Alright. This is my parents' restaurant. I'm usually working but if you give me a call we could do something with or without your mom. [Ares] This place hasn't changed. Ares. Gregory. - [Gregory] Been a while, huh? - [Ares] Two years, yeah. - You missed last summer. - Yeah, I was away. [Gregory] Ah. The future winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, Raquel Mendoza. We're in the same class. How are you? I'm Ares. [Gregory] I'd ask for an autograph before she gets famous. Really? Well, she's the best student in our year and the reason I'm enjoying the classes. You get the best grades on your own. Just to impress you, although it hasn't worked yet. [inhales] Her mom keeps getting in my way after a year of trying. Your mother, why's that? Good to see you, I'm gonna go now. - So close. - Stop it, Ares. We know what transpires when someone's flirting and you just happen to drop in. I won't be in your way, man. You forgot the water. Seriously, Ares? [laughs] [upbeat playful music playing] [laughter] Wanna go for a swim? - [Claudia] Whiskey? - Yeah. Hey, Sofia. Do you want to eat here? I could go either way. - [Raquel giggling] - [splash] [Ares] This way. [Raquel] Wait for me! [Ares breathing heavily] Don't look at me like that, witch. [calm music playing] I've been thinking all day about um, what we said. About searching until we find each other again. Well, and what did you decide? I was thinking you [inhales] maybe could start by searching here. [woman] Ares! Hey! Ares! Hey! Over here! [in French] Towel, sir. [in English] Thanks. [woman] Oh my God! How are you? - [Ares] How are you? - [woman] It's so good to see you. - What's up? - [Ares] Having fun? Great. Everything's so great. And you are Raquel, right? This is so great. I'm Vera. It's so nice to meet you. Ares couldn't stop talking about you all year. This is my mom, Camila. Remember I told you about him, mom? Yeah! Oh! I've been dying to get to know you. I hear so much about Alpha 3. All good things. Well, my dad and brother run the company, so they deserve the credit. Just as rebellious as Vera. - That's why you're a good pair, huh? - [Vera] Mom! Don't listen to her. She says whatever comes to her head and you can see, she lost her manners. I don't have manners - but I do have eyes. - [Vera] Oh my God. [Camila laughs] Mm. Go ahead, excuse me. Hello? [Mr. Hidalgo] Yes. Yes, yes. Please. No, no, no. More. More. Come on! I'm on vacation. [Mrs. Hidalgo] Don't overdo it, Juan. - So what are you doing here? - On my yacht? [laughs] No, it's just, uh, my mother loves to do this whole Mediterranean tour every year. Did I tell you that? I remember you said you had a boat over here so I was like, "I'll pop in!" [laughs] But it was more to check on her because the last time in Venice, I mean, it was crazy. She almost fell overboard. Oh my God, you should have seen it. My mom also took a trip to Venice once. Oh. Man, the tourists. I'm like ugh. - Vera. - What? No. I'm joking. I love it. I love Venice. Really. Tourists and all. Your mother has really good taste, huh? And well, if you're her daughter, she must be pretty. Thanks. Lucky man right there. - [chef in French] Want a drink? - [in English] Stay for dinner! Dominique's a great chef. He's incredible. [laughs] - Cuisine française. - Française. - Française. - [Dominique in French] Fine. Française. [laughs] [in English] What do you think? Sure. [Vera] So art then, huh? Of course. I love it. [laughs] What do you do? [Yoshua] My parents, uh, they think that I study law. And what do you really do? Sit and think. - [Vera] I love it. - You love it all, don't you? Well Raquel hasn't said what she does yet. [Raquel] I study literature. [Vera] Ooh. A humanist. [laughs] Let me guess Vera, you also love it? Alright, but tell me what it's like being with a scientific boy. Actually, Raquel was the one who convinced him to study medicine. - Really? - Yeah, because you know, he wanted to. Oh, that is so sweet. That's kind. It says a lot about you. - And what would you have done? - With Ares? Hmm. I think I would have just kept him all to myself. [laughs] Sure. No, I'm joking. He actually made a really good choice with Stockholm. The parties there are as demanding as the studying. Oh. Yeah, I get that. [Ares] Anyway, Vera's more of a party animal than I am. Mm mm! Whose idea was it to dance in the snow totally butt naked? - Wait, what? - [Ares] Well, I was super drunk and I... Exactly, dude. Or when we stayed out all night and the bromide exploded. - So you guys have been naked together? - Okay, well the bromide wasn't me either. [Vera] Okay, okay, well. But you know what the real truth was? You looked like you were a good boy. Or so we thought. But you're not really a good boy. Not at all. Oh, he isn't? So, tell us then. No, well actually, he's super good. It's so boring. You're very lucky Raquel. Raquel's about to publish her first novel soon. - [Daniela] Yeah. - Yeah. She's been working on it all year. You haven't said anything. Uh, it's just, um... [Yoshua] The publisher is just waiting to be emailed the manuscript. [Vera] That's such good news. Congratulations! [Yoshua] You should read it. It's called Through My Window. And what's it about? - Well it's the story of Raquel and your... - Yoshi, please. Well. I'm sorry. - [Yoshua] It's so good. - Wait. I'll go. [Apolo] When's it coming out? [distant laughter] [Vera] Hey. It's pretty, right? - Sorry about that. - Why? I took over the whole conversation. You're publishing a book and we're just talking about parties. Tsk. I'm not publishing anything. I haven't even sent the book out yet, you know? So, who do you write for? They say there's always someone, right? So then, who is yours? My father. He was a writer. Was? He died when I was pretty young. My dad abandoned us. Me and my mom. Then my mom met Carlos. And she was good after that but growing up it was just us two. Alright look, I know we just met each other and all but believe me, I know how you feel about the novel. I've been studying medicine for almost a year now and I still don't know if I do it because I like it or well, because my dad would've liked it. It's like the ones who are gone influence us more than who's here. But you take your time, okay? You know with the email and all that. You'll be okay. [playful upbeat music playing] [cheering] Daniela, that's my drink! - What? - [Apolo] That's my drink! Not anymore! Sorry sweetie, it's gone. [man] Hello, hello. - Having fun? - [woman] You, get out. [man] Every bird to its nest. I'd leave if I were you. Let's get out of here, man. - He's totally a tourist. - [woman] He's got no fucking clue. - [man] Maybe he feels like playing. - Yeah. Hey, you. Looking for trouble, baby? [laughter] Leave him alone, Borja. - He's my friend. - [scoffs] So what about it? Stay out of this, Anna. [sinister laughter] I said leave him alone! - [woman] What the hell? - Stay out of this. - My arm! - [woman] You'll break his arm. [man] Stop! Stop! Stop! Fuck that hurts my wrist! - Help me for fuck's sake! - Let him go. You better watch yourself little girl. Let's go. [scoffs] [door slams shut] [Anna] They think they own this place. Cool, uh... Dope ring. - Where'd you get it? - It was the prize in a bag of chips. Ah. Interesting. [door opens] What do you think of Vera? She's cool. She's super nice. She had a lot of fun with Ares this year. Much more than you did. Daniela, stop stirring up shit right now. - I'm sorry. I don't trust her. - Then trust Ares. - I'll be the one to doubt him for you. - They're just friends. [shower running] - You were talking to Vera a while, huh? - What? [Ares] You and Vera talked a lot. Oh, yeah. I guess. What'd she tell you? [Raquel] Nothing. [sighs] [phone vibrates] [unlocks phone] ISN'T THIS ARES' SHIRT? [somber music playing] [breathes deeply] He's only been her friend. He's only been her friend. Only friends. Only friends. What is it? Uh, what are you doing? I'm driving. Thank you. [engine starts] - So, are you ready? - Let's go! Come on! - Hey can you drive this? - Let's go! - It's just like a motorcycle, Yoshi. - Yeah, which you've never driven before. [upbeat indie rock music playing] [laughs] [cheers] [cheering] - [Yoshua] Are you sure it's this way? - [Raquel] I don't know. I've never been here before. [Gregory] I pictured your mom as more of a woman. This is Anna, my sister. Raquel, Yoshi. - Hello. - Hello. I'm meeting Ares at the beach. - He said he's with his girlfriend. - Come on! - [Raquel] His girlfriend. - [Gregory] Yeah. Who'd have thought? Ares Hidalgo in a relationship. Hm. - [Daniela] Go on, I'm waiting on Raquel. - [Apolo] You sure? [Daniela] Yeah. Go ahead. - The Hidalgo secret beach is pretty rad. - It's warm! Hello. [Anna] History repeats itself. It's kind of funny this time though, right? [Daniela] Hey! Please stop. That's it. It's freezing. Don't splash me. Like this? [screams] - Already? - [screams] Hey. Wanna go for a swim? [grunts] I was about to fall asleep so, uh... Go if you want. [Gregory] I thought we were friends. Who? You and Ares? [Gregory] You and me. I'm a little confused. Why can't we be friends anymore? Because I know nothing about you. Sorry, Gregory, about the restaurant. He didn't give me a way out. You know how Ares is. [Gregory] A few years ago I dated a girl named Bea who went to our high school. We were deeply in love with each other until... - Until Ares took an interest in her. - Gregory, you don't need to... [Gregory] They went out for two weeks, Raquel. And on the third week, Ares hooked up with someone else. Are we still friends? [Gregory] Still friends. You're just gonna sit staring at the ocean, lost in thought? Bit of a cliché. Right? So, I was stalking you online. Couldn't find anything. Is that a compliment? [inhales] So you wanna hook up or what? - No. - Not into me? - We just met each other. - Yeah, so what? And besides, it's not like I don't know you at all. I know a lot of things about you. - Oh, really? Like what? - Well, like that, um, you... That you like to sit lost in thought watching the waves come in. I also know you like potato chips. So, you wanna hook up or not? Do you normally hit on guys this way? Well, I like you. And you like me too. And what makes you think that? 'Cause you're still here. [Mrs. Hidalgo] Claudia, I can't find the email with tonight's reservation. - Can you forward it to me? - [phone beeps] About Greece, talk to the agency and call me if they give you any trouble. [phone beeps] Claudia, where are you? Can you call me please? [phone beeps] Do you know where my cream-colored blouse is? [Claudia humming] [exhales] [tires screech] [church bells ringing] - Hello. - Hello. [guitar music playing] Claudia, uh, I've been looking for you and I can't find you. I wanna talk to you and... [Claudia singing in Spanish] - [in English] Give it up for Claudia. - [laughs] - Wow, look at that. - Thank you. [laughs] Thank you very much. [ominous music playing] [tires screech] What do you think? [Ares] Not bad. [Vera] Oh, is it too strong? [Ares] No, I'm just not a fan of mint. It's a good drink, just not my kind of drink, you know? - You okay? - [Vera] You want something sweeter right? Or no? Like your little fancy daiquiri thing. I believe it's time for a game. Spin the bottle. You know the rules. You choose between truth or kiss. You get to choose if you're spinning it. - [Vera] That sounds like fun. - Those aren't the rules. Well, it's my bottle, my rules. - Ah, okay then. - [Gregory] Spin the bottle. [Daniela] Go on, Raquel. Okay, okay, okay. [sighs] Ares. - [Apolo] So... - What'll it be then? Well, truth. [Apolo] Oh, okay. I get it now. At any point in the last year, did you wish you weren't with Ares? [Daniela] You, shut up. The bottle pointed to Ares. You're the one who's asking. - [Apolo] Wait, I'm confused. - Why are we playing this right now? Because it's fun! That's why. - [Apolo] Okay, well, I'll go. - [Daniela] Go for it. [Anna] Wow. [Apolo] Now what? [Anna] Ooh la la. - Spin again. - Hey. No, no. It's very clear who it's pointing at. - So then what do you choose? - Oh, he really only speaks one language. - En français. - Ah! I bet he has time for a little kiss. [in French] Dominique, are you playing? [in French] That depends, am I? - [in English] Well, he says he does. - [laughs] [Dominique in French] I didn't actually say that. [in English] The bottle decides. [in French] Well, if it's about kissing, I'm in the game. [Vera in English] Oh my God! - What did he say? - [Anna] Alright, that's enough. I move. [whispering] Better be ready. [Apolo] No. [Daniela] Alright, let's see. [Apolo] Boy. You just cheated. You rigged it, so... - Get it, girl. - Go, go, go. [Gregory] Yeah. [Apolo] Wow. I'm gonna get another mojito. Anyone else want one? I could just, uh... I'll just bring a little bit of everything. [Raquel] Come back, Yoshi! Come back. [Yoshua] Shit. Oh my God. Come on, not now. Raquel needs me. Don't do this to me now. I'm begging you. You walk into the only place on the boat that has a lock and you don't lock it? That's proof you like me. [alternative reggaeton music playing] Do you need some more proof? N... No. Great. I brought condoms. [breathing heavily] [moaning] Raquel! [groaning] [giggles] [gentle music playing] So, how's your new friend? Claudia. I would like a whiskey. Well, the whiskey's over there. You still work in this house regardless of what you want people to think. [Claudia sighs] Well, shit. [exhales] [somber music playing] [woman clears throat] We can't both be redheads. I told you that before. People might think you're family. Yeah. But you dye your hair. [inhales] That's it, you're fired. - No, son. Don't... - No. Get your things and get out. Careful. Don't slip. [Ares] Guess it's my turn. [Apolo] It's you, Dani. Truth. - You wanna ask, Raquel? - [Apolo] That's cheating. You said so earlier. I'll do it then. - Tell me what to ask. - [Apolo] Unbelievable. Ask him if anyone else has worn the shirt he's wearing. [Gregory] Wow. This is getting interesting now, huh? The shirt you're wearing. Has anybody worn it besides you? I don't know. [Raquel] You have to tell the truth. I really don't know. Well, okay... Truth. - Have you had sex with him? - [sighs] This is crazy, Raquel. There's a photo of you wearing the same shirt. Have you had sex with him? [grunts] Crap. Hey. [Raquel crying] Hey. I feel like such an idiot. I think tears may do wonders for your skin. You're gonna look amazing. You're the best. Do you know that? [Daniela] He's here. Can we talk? [sighs] What for? Do you want to tell me all the details? [sighs] So I can explain things. [clicks fingers] [whispering] Come here. The night of the shirt I got super wasted. I drank so much. And I don't remember anything. [inhales] All I remember is Vera in bed next to me the morning after. Wearing the shirt. The rest is blank. [Raquel sniffs] So you came to visit me because you felt guilty about it? No. I came here because I wanted to see you. I wanted to be with you. Okay. Great. So... [exhales] So, I guess you had sex with Vera to realize you want to be with me, is that it? You know it's more complicated than that. Why would I know that? Well, you didn't tell Gregory you had a boyfriend, apparently. Did you? - I didn't hide anything from him. - Not trying to keep score. Oh, really? Because it sounds like you are. - I'm just trying to explain. - Explain then! This year's just been shitty, Raquel! Alright? Getting this degree has been harder than I expected and I felt like an idiot. Every day I wonder what the fuck I'm even doing studying in Stockholm. And if I really want to do medicine or not. [somber music playing] Then I met Vera. Vera could see I wasn't doing well. She helped me. She was a good friend. [exhales] I made a lot of friends through her. We'd go out and get drunk at parties and stuff. Sometimes, I overdid it. Then the thing with the shirt happened. [Raquel sighs] I know I screwed up. I really do. But please try to understand. I would love to say that the problem is whatever happened with Vera. But what hurts me more is that you didn't talk to me about any of the issues you were dealing with. [sighs] It's just I was afraid that I was gonna look stupid. Stupid for having doubts? Stupid for having feelings? Why? Because I was afraid that you were moving on while I was just waiting for your call. [gasps] It's Yoshi's fault. - Let's go to the party. - Mhm. - Let's see. Um... - Oof. Oh my God. - Imagine if your parents saw this. - No one's going to see this. - [doorbell rings] - Oh, Mr. Hidalgo. - Please sir, your son is so hot. - No one will see this. - You're crazy. Hey. - I mean, look. [doorbell rings] Your son is so... Ooh! [laughs] [doorbell rings] [playful music playing] Is Yoshi here? Ugh. [inhales] Get out. I think that you look super sexy. - Yeah? - Mhm. - They're not a bit too much? - No. Not at all. The bolder, the sexier. [laughs] We should live up to these nails tonight, what do you think? Hmm? What if we had sex with someone else? [sighs] - Daniela, I'm okay as we are. - Are you sure? Because tonight's party would be so easy. Daniela, I wasn't going to go to that. I think it's more of a friends thing and I don't want to impose. [Daniela sighs] You wouldn't be intruding. No. And besides, I want to stay here at the house. But you go and have fun. [Daniela] Fine. If that's what you want. I'll go have fun while you can be lame at home. [door slides open] Guess where we can go. Um... Come on, just guess. Anywhere. I got the lighthouse keys. I always watch the fireworks from there. Mhm. If you want, you can come with me and we'll watch them together. It seems far but only takes a few minutes. It's just a few turns and we're there. It... It's just that, you know, I had plans with my friends to go to the party on the beach. Yeah. I thought the bathroom thing had meant you'd changed. But I guess not. I... How many lovers have you rejected 'cause of Raquel? Anna, how are you? Wait. What's up with her? Mm. Nothing. - Hey, so are you ready to party? - Yep. [exhales] - I'm coming. - Alright, let's go. - Yep. - [Raquel] Let's head down. [ominous music playing] [motorbike engine starts] [motorbike fades into distance] [upbeat indie pop music playing] [shouting and laughter] [fireworks sound] We should go, shouldn't we? [fireworks continue to sound] [takes a deep breath] Let's go together. - Ares? - Not a chance. Artemis? [upbeat Brazilian funk music playing] - I want to make a toast to us three! - [laughing] I love you guys so much. - Are you crying? - No. [gasps] - I'm gonna bring us some drinks. - He's crying. Oh. [laughs] He's already drunk. [fireworks sound] [motorbike engine sounds] What now? - I'll be right back. - But... Is this why you wanted me to come? Seriously? Stay away from the bar, okay? I know what you're like. - I'VE BEEN HORNY ALL DAY - LOL. WE'LL FIX THAT. DON'T WORRY - [locks phone] - [Vera] I thought you might be down here. [upbeat indie pop music playing] You're here. [laughs] [man] Artemis? Artemis Hidalgo? That's you, right? Hey, baby. They don't have any non-alcoholic beer. - Yeah, oh. - Here, I got this for you. Whatever, I just won't drink anything. Oh! Artemis. I'm María. María Codina. The Master's program with Claudia. - Ah. - And this is my husband, Eduard. [laughs] Hey, it's really nice to meet you. - Yeah. - I'm so glad we ran into you. We've both heard so much about you. So much. Yep. [upbeat indie pop music playing] [breathes heavily] It feels amazing. Well, a bit salty, if you ask me, but ahh, still nice. You're not coming in? Don't make me push you in with your clothes on. Can I tell you a secret? The truth is... All we did was sleep the night I wore the shirt. But we're free to explore now. But how come you lied? In the game. [scoffs] Why? What? I didn't say anything, Ares. Your reaction is what made her think that and that's on you. It's your bar, you don't even know where they are? - I know where they are, I ensure... - Raquel. I got the drinks for us. Yoshi. How are you? Where did Daniela go? I don't know. Um... I... I'm gonna be gone for a little bit. But why? I thought the three of us were hanging out. I'm gonna be right back. Alright? - But what about the drinks? - Drink 'em. [Raquel] Yoshi! I love you. [laughs] [girls screaming and laughing] [grunts] [cheering and whistling] [drumbeats sound] - Jesus, what the fuck, dude? - [man] Is that the guy from last night? [woman] Where's your bodyguard now, you fucking piece of shit? [chilled jazz music playing] [knocks on door] Claudia? María told me you'd be here, I... I want to stop acting like an Hidalgo. And I want to start acting like the boyfriend you deserve. [sighs] [waves crashing] [kissing] [heavy breathing] [calm music playing] [Dominique in French] Incredible. Don't stop. Keep going. [fireworks sound] - [in English] Cheers. - [Raquel] Ooh! Cheers. [giggles] Why'd you do it? Are you gonna tell me this was somehow all my fault? And still, it's nothing to be proud of, Vera. [Vera] Well, proud or not, you can't deny what happened last year. I was lost. I know that. I also know exactly how you feel. Doubts about your career, the pressure. All your family's demands. [sighs] [Claudia] It's easy to stop being an Hidalgo. Becoming the boyfriend I deserve is gonna be more complicated. Much more. I deserve a lot, Artemis. - Uh Clau... - [Claudia] Good night. I... [giggling] Ares, you and I get each other because we're from the same world. [inhales] Is something wrong? This isn't what I want. I thought I did, but I realize I actually don't. [Vera] But... [playful music playing] [car alarm sounds] Fuck! Shit! He stole my fucking keys! Fuck! You son of a bitch! [motorbike engine sounds] [dramatic music playing] [horn honks] [shouting] Everything on this vacation has gone perfectly. [laughs] - Oh. - Oh. [motorbike engine sounds] [Borja] Hey! That's my fucking bike! [woman] We'll catch him! Faster! [man] Fucking thief! Hey! - Go faster! - Pull over, asshole! [Borja] I told you to stop! Fucking stop! Stop, fucker! We've almost got this, come on! Pull over! Hey! [woman] Stop the bike! [Borja] That's mine! Stop the fucking bike! Hey, hey! Asshole! [ethereal music playing] [car horn honks] [tires screech] [crash sounds] [fireworks sound] [breathes heavily] What's wrong? [motorbike engine sounds] Shit! Shit! Call an ambulance! Call a fucking ambulance! [engine sounds] [fireworks sound] [Raquel] Ares? [Daniela] Raquel! It's Yoshi! Yoshi? Yoshi! Yoshi! Yoshi! Yoshi! Yoshi! Fuck. [grunts] Yoshi, come on. Yoshi, please. Please! [breathes heavily] Yoshi! Yoshi, come on! Yoshi, wake up! [dramatic music playing] Someone, help! Wake up, God damn it. Yoshi! Yoshi, please! Help! What happened? Holy shit, Borja. Fuck! Where's Yoshi? Yoshi? - [Daniela] What happened? - [Borja] We called an ambulance. [Daniela] That doesn't answer my question. What happened? [girl] It was an accident. Yoshi? [Daniela] What do you mean, accident? - Yoshi? - [Daniela] What did you do? Yoshi? Yoshi! [crying] Yoshi! Yoshi! - Yoshi! Yoshi! - [Daniela] Raquel, no. Yoshi! - [Anna] Raquel! - Are you okay? Hey! What happened? What happened? Anna. - Yoshua. - Yoshi? He took off on a motorcycle. [Ares] Someone, help! - What about you? - Hey! You should... - Calm down! - Okay, Anna, call an ambulance. - Do something. - What did you do to him? Stop. Yoshi! Yoshi. Yoshi, please don't leave me. Yoshi. I... I couldn't... How are you? Yoshi's parents are over here. I'm so sorry, Raquel. It's crushing news for all of us. Yeah. He was so young. [Yoshi's father] Raquel. [clears throat] His best friend and future wife. He was always such a special boy. And he dared to be himself because you were by his side. Thank you, Raquel. Thank you for taking care of him all these years. [sighs] Do you remember Raquel? [undertaker] You can come in now. See you inside. [sighs] [Daniela] Raquel! Why is he dressed like that? Yoshi is wearing black? Y... Yoshi hates black suits. Yoshi hates black suits. No. No. He... He... He can't be dressed like this. Yoshi hates that color. He hates it. Ares, you see this? Who dressed him like this? - Calm down. - What? No. - Yoshi cannot be dressed like that. - Raquel, please. Calm down. That's my friend in a damn coffin over there. Who the hell do you think you are? Let's get some air. [crying] I don't want to get any air. I don't want to! Does my crying bother you? Is it bothering you? [somber music playing] I know it bothers you because you're bothered by anything involving feelings. - You put your armor on and that's it. - Just stop, Raquel. No, that's what you do. You put on armor. You put on armor so you don't have to feel anything. So, what should I do? You should've saved him! Why couldn't you save him? Fuck! Of all people in the world, he's the one you should've saved! What is it, Ares? Say something! Let's hear it. Say what you're thinking! Maybe I could have saved him if I hadn't spent the year distracted by my phone. [exhales] Yeah, okay. So, I guess you're saying it's my fault that this happened. You're the one who just dumped him to go with Gregory. On behalf of my family, I want to thank you very much for being here tonight. I was three months and four days older than you. So I always believed that you'd be the one who would be speaking at my funeral. I imagined you standing over my coffin and I kind of enjoyed it. I guess I liked the thought because I was never able to imagine even a second of my life without you in it. I don't know how it happened, but... But that second has turned into hours, days, and someday, probably into years. You left us so much sooner than any of us would have wanted, Yoshi. You and I had so much more to do. Like after this, for example, I wish we could both go watch a movie or I wish, um, I wish we could huddle up together in the library to study one more time. I wish I could just have one more single second with you to tell you that I'm sorry. You, um, you told me once that... That friends will last forever but boyfriends are temporary and I believed you. I assumed you'd always be there. And I made a mistake in choosing who to spend my time with. I became blinded by what was temporary and I don't know what to do... without what was going to be my forever. Because even though you always stood by my side, friends do leave you, like you just did. [crying] I will learn how to love... I'm going to be the boyfriend you deserve. [Raquel] ...without excuses. Without... Without conditions. You taught us how to love each other. You were the most loyal friend. The strongest and the best. I think that's what you were trying to say when you said we'd be together forever. It'd be impossible to forget you. [crying] [thud] [somber music playing] [metal clangs] [metal clangs] [rumbling sound] Come on. [Ares] Nobody questions you when things are going well. It's when things go wrong that everyone starts to question you. This year... This year, I've questioned myself a lot. Every night, I search for the reason that I came to Stockholm. And I swear, sometimes I wish that I'd forget why I came. But I can't. Not anymore. Because things aren't as easy now. They're broken. HI RAQUEL. HOW ARE YOU? I'M SORRY [phone vibrates] And now, I know why I'm here. ARE YOU IN STOCKHOLM? TEXT ME BACK, PLEASE So I don't make the same mistakes again. I can't let things go wrong again. I won't. [church bells ringing] RE: THROUGH MY WINDOW [Daniela] "Hello, Raquel." "We read your manuscript that is entitled Through My Window." "We liked it very much." "We believe it would be a great fit in our young adult collection." "And we want to publish the novel." "Your agent Yoshua García gave us your info so we'd be able to contact you directly." [Raquel and Yoshua] "Hello. I'm Yoshua García." "I'm Raquel Mendoza's literary agent." "My amazing client has written a novel but she's worried about sending it to you and having you say you're not interested." "That's why I'm sending it." "Because I'm her agent and I'm sure you'll love it." "The novel is incredible. It's in the attachment." "I love the main character." "When you've finished reading the book, then please just send Raquel an email." [Yoshi] "If you don't happen to hear back from her, you can contact Daniela Fernandez, my assistant." "This is her email address." "Warm greetings." [Raquel and Yoshi] "Yoshi" - [knock on door] - [Raquel's mom] Honey. There's a boy downstairs who wants to see you. His name is Gregory. Should I let him up? Um, you want me to leave? No. I'd rather not. I'll, um... I'll call him another day. [upbeat indie pop music playing] THROUGH MY WINDOW: ACROSS THE SEA T0 B3 C0N71NU3D...
