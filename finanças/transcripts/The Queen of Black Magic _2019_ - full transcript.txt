There is no signal here. - Do you have a signal? - No. Calm down. We'll be there in half an hour. Why didn't we go to Bali? The place is not even on the map. At least we will take advantage of what we have. Haqi. If you speak like an old man, will never have friends at school. You probably say that from experience. How is it? I have a lot of followers on Instagram How many do you have? You only have 200. I have a billion. I already spoke once. The man who raised me at the orphanage is very sick now. That is why we are going to visit you. You should know that not everyone has parents. Look at your father, even without his parents, he had a lot of willpower. You should be like that too. So, why didn't you adopt us? I think it's time. They are old enough to know. Know what? We are not your true parents. We adopted you when you were little. Oh no, so are you taking us back to the orphanage? Just kidding, Haqi! - We're playing. - It was just a joke. I don't care if it's adopted. Ah, you are our little Haqi. But it makes sense because Haqi doesn't look like any of us. Look, Haqi is my most beautiful son. Dina, don't say that. Your grandmother once told me that I was not pretty, and so far I don't feel pretty. But mom, if you keep telling someone that he’s beautiful, she will find herself like Dina! Shut up! You think so too! - I think you are beautiful. - I am! You... What was this? Are you okay? - Haqi. - I want to take a look. Stay in the car. Daddy. Nif, what was that? Any animal? Yes. A deer. We will. Come on. Go get the boxes Okay. Maman. How are you? Good. How are you? Are you okay? Thank God, yes. This is my wife. Nadya. Maman. - Haqi. - Maman. These are Sandi and Dina. It's been years. Yes, it's been a long time. I haven't been here in a while. - This is Siti. - Siti? - My wife. - Ah yes. Hanif, Siti. How are you? Nadya. Haqi. What happened to your face? Behave yourself. These are Dina and Sandi. We brought some presents from Jakarta. This is for children, Maman. Thank you sir. I'll take you inside. We will. We will. Thank God. - Nife! - Not that. Nadya. How are you? Are you okay? Fine. - Hanif! - Imão. Hi, Nad. Nice to see you, man. - Did you keep growing? - You too. How are you? Hi how are you? - Haqi. - Hi! Hi gorgeous. Hello. Hi. Hi. So, let's go inside. Come on. Honey? Dear. Aunt, are you sick? Play here. - There's no signal. - Drop the phone. So, here we are again. This time with friends. Maman. - Anton. - How are you? Good. - Maman. - Jef. Maman. Where are all the kids? Two of them are still here, sir. The rest went on a bus tour. They'll be back at night. Why do you keep calling me "sir"? Sorry, Nif. Hasbi, Rani, this is Uncle Hanif. Hello. Hasbi. Rani. Sandi, Dina, Haqi, come here! These are my children. - Touch here. - Okay. - Sandi. - Rani. - Sandi. - Hasbi. - Dina. - Hasbi. Where's Mister Bandi at? He keeps talking about the three of you. - I'll take you to him. - Very well. Mister Bandi? It's me, Hanif. Anton is here and so is Jefri. We came to visit you. Have you ever been here? No, never. But Hanif told me a lot about the orphanage. Weird. I had never heard of Mr. Bandi until we were on our way here. Why will it be? Maybe Jefri was too busy to talk about childhood. But you're fine, aren't you? I mean... Sorry, I didn't want to bring it up. Okay. You are still just married. Anton usually does that, too. - Please help yourself. - Thank you, Siti. Honey. Shall we go in too? This is Mr. Bandi. He created us all here. If it weren't for him... we probably would never have met. Maybe Jefri, Anton and me... we would have died, abandoned. This is the children's part. This is the living room. Here we watch television. I cleaned the room for you. Thanks. I don't want to disturb anyone. How long have you lived here? I've been here since baby. Rani... since 10. The mother left her here. She didn't leave me here. She will be back. She abandoned you, Rani. She never came to visit. Maybe she will come soon. In dreams? Why did she leave you? The pregnancy was an accident. An accident? How did this happen? Is this your room? No. It has not been opened for a long time. We will. I cleaned the bed, and I guarantee it doesn't smell. Very well. - Haqi! - This is my bed! Sit here. Sorry, I'm giving you a lot of work. Nothing. I had nothing to do. Where are you going to sleep? In another room. Not here. This hasn't been open for 20 years. What's in it? Nothing. There was a woman who worked here. Her name was Mrs. Mirah. One day she went for a walk with another girl named Murni. Suddenly, she came back screaming that Murni had been kidnapped by a demon. What? A demon? She kept screaming like crazy. So they locked her here. Everyone at the orphanage went to look for Murni. Mrs. Mirah kept knocking on the door. But nobody opened it for her. They say that when they finally opened the door... they found her dead. Because she kept banging her head against the door until her head broke. In the end, everyone started to think that Murni had killed her. Some even say... that she is still there inside. In this room? Where is Murni? They haven't found her yet. They say that Mrs. Mirah was buried in the forest, but no one knows where. Enough of that. I will help Maman and Siti. Look. Photos from our childhood. Guess who is? - Uncle Anton. - No, it's not him. This is your father. When he was still poor. But always the most beautiful of all. Many families wanted to adopt him. But your father decided to stay here and look after the others. He was finally adopted by grandma and grandpa, right? Fortunately. And luckily, after adoption, he became a good man. That is true happiness. Many people have a different destination. That's why they prefer to stay here, until they grow up. Who for example? Were Uncle Maman and Aunt Siti from this orphanage too? We still are. They are soul mates! Perfect soulmates! It's that? Don't you know who it is? No? This is Uncle Jefri. He was completely different! He was a little chubby when he was a boy... but now it's only a century... Good for him. Look, this is your dad. Why are all the photos turned? Let me see. Who is this? - Uncle, who is it? - Good... This is mrs. Mirah. She took care of us when we were little. The one who went crazy and locked her in a room... and she banged her head on the door until her head broke? - Bullshit! - That's what Rani said. Do not repeat everything that others say, Haqi. Mrs. Mirah fell ill. And she died. In fact, she loved us all. Who's on her side? It's Murni. One of our friends. And where is she now? She disappeared. She is the one that Mrs. Mirah killed... and buried in the forest? Haqi! Okay, who's hungry? - Come on. - We will. We will. - are you? - The most beautiful. Mrs. Mirah and Murni... What is their story? Mirah was stressed. She went crazy. One of her favorite girls, Murni, ran away from the orphanage. To where? We don't know. Every year there was a child who ran away. What's it? What animal bit you? Nothing, honey. I was thinking about the accident. Do you think children will be traumatized by that? No, not for that. So for what? Nothing, honey. Everything is fine. It will help in the kitchen. Now you are ordering me like other husbands. That is not what I meant, dear. You still have that bread in the car. Okay, I'll get it. I think, Mr. Bandi doesn't have much time. He's getting worse. What will happen to this place when it is gone? From what his kids said... they will sell everything. Or turn into a resort. They don't need money. They are rich. - They're not going to sell. - That's right. But who will take care of this? We will help. You know that they can't sell this place, do you? We don't know what they can find out here if they sell the orphanage. They are not going to sell. What are you doing, Nif? Come with me, brother. Where are we going? I ran over something when I came here. What? I thought it was just a deer. You found? It can only be a deer. I don't know. I need to be sure. Here you are, brother. What I ran over. Nif. Nif, come here! Shit. What the fuck. Damn it! - She's dead, Nif. She's dead. - And I hit her. I think I ran over. Shit, man. Damn it! Nif, what are we going to do? Nif, we have to take her. Hanif! Hanif! Nif! Nif! Nif! Wait for me, Nif! Hanif! Nif! Wait for me, Nif! Hanif! Shit. Shit! Shit! Shit! Hanif! Nif! - What happened to them? - There's no signal. We can't just leave them there. Okay. So, let's go to the police station. It's two hours until then! Then we'll go back to the orphanage and call from there. Are you okay? Maman? Doesn't this telegone work? No. It's been a few days. We don't pay the bill. The signal here is very bad. Please help yourself. Thank you, Siti. Maman, Siti, come and eat with us. Okay. Yes. We already ate. - Please. - Thanks. Thank you, Maman. Dina, Haqi, finish your food. Okay, mom. Do you only have food? Never mind. Everything is fine. Lina, aren't you going to eat? No, I'm trying to skip dinner. Are you on a diet? You don't need this. Honey, why do you say that? - What's it? - You are rude. You have a beautiful body. But seriously, you are not fat. Lin? On here. No, thanks. As a child, I hated fruit. Is it really? But, why do you keep spraying it? - Well, that's... - So... A few months ago... she had a skin rash. She was paranoid that it was a carnivorous bacterium. Carnivorous bacteria? It turns out it's just dry skin. It can't be just dry skin, honey. You saw it yourself, it became a bubble of pus. Sorry. I didn't want to bring that up at dinner. The doctor said you have dry skin, honey. I don't. You didn't understand. Sorry, what did you say? Where are Jefri and Hanif? Really, where are they? It is an old custom, from when they were boys. The two always disappeared and left me alone. They were sure to leave. You can never have a normal conversation. So you are the oldest here? I am. Some families wanted to adopt me, but... I never had the courage to leave the younger children here. That was cool. You are very responsible. Rani. I saw mrs. Mirah. Where? In the photo album. It shouldn't be opened. That's why Mr. Bandi hid it. But if you want, there's a video - that I can show you. - Are you serious? After dinner, yes? Don't envy them just because they live a better life. We don't know if they are really happy. I do not envy them. Only one thought occurred to me. Did you stay here just because you felt sorry for me? How can you think of such a thing? I married you... because no one else would marry any of us. Can I help, uncle and aunt? You don't have to. I am very happy that you are all here. Can I drink something? Just a second. Here it is. Many people don't like it when I ask questions. What do you want to ask? Sorry, aunt. But what happened to your face? When I was little, I was carrying boiling water. As I walked, I slipped. I fell and the hot water spilled on my face. Got it. I was just curious. You are beautiful. And you are beautiful. Not bad. How long have you been getting a kiss. Here we all have time to sleep. But sometimes I come here to watch TV while others are asleep. Why don't you subscribe to a streaming service? Streaming? Through the Internet. Internet? Wi-fi, you know. - Wi-fi? - On the cellphone? - Cell phones don't work here. - Yes. What is it? - See the cassette. - Is it big? Do you have a hard drive? Cool, it's automatic. It's my father! - Speak quietly. - It's my father. He looked like you when he was little. Is it good to have parents? They have a good side and a bad side. What would be bad? When you're scolded. I wouldn't mind being scolded. Especially if you have parents. Jefri! Hanif! Anton! Oh, my God, boys! This is Mrs. Mirah. What do her feet have? You messers! Get out of here! When she was a baby, she cried a lot. Then the father broke her leg. And you still want to have parents? Wait, I want to keep watching! Enough is enough. You will have nightmares and you will not be able to sleep. I am not afraid. Enough of that. - And now? - We need to call the police. What are you two doing? Look back. My God! Shit! Shit! Shit! Very well. Explain that to me. Hanif! Explain. I ran over the girl coming here. It was an accident. How did this happen? I didn't want to run over it. Okay. Panic. Calm down. I also saw the bus. Inside it were all the children at the orphanage. - They're all dead. - The bus from this orphanage? - What are you saying, Nif? - I saw it with my own eyes. If you don't believe in us, you will see for yourself. Okay, calm down. So let's call the police. I wanted to call from here. - Use the phone here. - It won't. It hasn't worked in a few days. Let's talk to the others. Are you crazy? One of us should go to the police station. But I'm not going, okay? If I go, my wife would panic. I also can't leave my wife here. We all leave here and on the way we stop at the police. - What about the orphans? - Okay, okay. Calm down. I'll. Where did this happen? At kilometer 81. Take that car. No. This is not my problem. It's your problem. How are you? I'm going to the place, and then I go to the police. That's it. Hey, Ton. Wow! Not bad that here. It is not so. It stays here. Wait for me. Look, not like that. You are wrong! Do you always play? Yes... What was this place originally? Why do you have so many rooms? It was a hospice. This is not true. This room was used... as a prospective dormitory. But they stopped using after... After? After we started to hear footsteps around the room. Do you think that... are the steps of mrs. Mirah? Yes. You can hear them from here. Doesn't that scare you? Is that true? - No. This is a lie. - It's true. Ran. Okay. - You can put that over there. - Okay. Where? What's my problem? Going to the forest in the middle of the night. Why did we have to come here on a weekday? If it was the weekend, we could have come in the morning and be home at night. KIL METRO 81 We will. We will. Hello? Hello? Hi? Hey! Open the door! Open the door! Hey! Honey, when are we leaving? What happened? Was the room this size when you lived here? No. It is not bad. Good... It was very tight here, when we were four here. When you four were here... they couldn't do much, could they? But if we're just two... Lina, Lina, Lina... Not here. It's a lack of respect. Mr. Bandi is sick. And this is the children's room. I'm going to do a hormonal treatment. What? Hormonal treatment. I told you. I'm gaining weight, but it's not because of food, but because my hormonal system is in disarray. Lina. You are already thinner. And it doesn't matter, I will always love you. - You never listen to me. - What's your problem? All this negativism, are they also hormones? Lina? Lina? So I'm thinner now, aren't I? Isn't that enough? Put that knife down, Lina. Lina! Lina! Lina! What happened, baby? Hanif! Hanif! Hanif! Jef? Jef? Lina! What happened? To the hospital! Now! Eva, drink this before. Eva, drink water. - Maman, we're going to the hospital! - Nif! Nif! - Eva doesn't stop coughing. - Eva, what's wrong? What is it? Eve? Eve? Eve! Hanif, we have to get out of here now! Eve! Maman, get a towel. FAST. - Eva? - Eva. - Here, Nif. - Okay, let's go. Come on! Jef! Jef! - Jef! - Wait, wait a minute. - Help me! - Here, quick! Okay, okay. OK let's go. - OK let's go. - Go! Go! Go! - Come on, Nadya. - We will. Hold on to. And the kids? Everything is fine. Maman and Siti are there. We will. And I won again. I thought you were good at that. Give up? What's that for? Come here. Where did that mouse come from? Why did you turn off the lights? What's the problem? I am afraid of dark. Do you really have to shoot him? They are plagues. They eat our food. You can put the food in the pantry. They have holes in the pantry. We are not rich like you. I go to the living room. You know the way. Turn off the light. Go. Go! You are not as nice as I thought. - You are weird. - And you're a whore, you know. Whatever. We should already be on the main road, dear. I went straight through. There is only one path to the main road. We cannot be lost. We are driving in circles. How asism? We've been on this road before! It's the same signal. Nif. Nif! Nif! It's happening again, Hanif! What are you talking about, Jef? Nif, what's going on? So well, so well. Twenty-five years ago... there was a fire in one of the orphanage rooms. Three girls died. Soon after... we found out that Mrs. Mirah... practiced black magic. She... burned those girls. As a sacrifice. We try to run, because we're going scared. But every time we ran... we... we always go back to the orphanage. We ran in a circle. Finally, Mr. Bandi captured Ms. Mirah. With the help of Jefri, Anton and me. FAST! FAST! Lock it up inside! And we arrest her. She kept knocking on the door. With your head. When we open the door... she was already dead. She broke her head at the door. We don't know what to do. So what did you do? We buried it. In the same room. And we throw concrete on the floor. Quickly! Is the body still there? Hasbi! Hasbi? Hasbi, where are you? I saw something. Hasbi? Hasbi? Hasbi, what's wrong? Hasbi, what happened? That hurts... It hurts! NO! MOTHER! Dad! Where's Anton? We need the car! Damn! He's taking too long. Sandi? Dina? Haqi? Sandi? Dina! Haqi! - What's it? - Where are my children? They were here. Haqi! Sandi! What's it? What happened? - Where's Haqi? - Haqi? Go find Haqi! - Wasn't he with you? - No! Haqi! Haqi! Haqi! - Where are the kids? - Sandi and Dina are looking for Haqi. There's a lot of space in the car. Nif! The kids are supposed to come home tonight. Let's use their bus. There was an accident. - All the kids are dead. - What? Jefri and I found the bus. All the children are dead inside it. Haqi. - We need to find Haqi. - Mother! - Where's Haqi at? - I don't know. We need to find him. - Haqi is not here. - Okay. - We should start looking for him. - Okay, okay. - You stay here, we'll find you. - I want to go look for him. We're going to look for him. You here. Are you okay? Come on. Rani, will you help us look for Haqi? Look for him in the house. Haqi... Jef! Jef, Haqi is missing. We're going to look for him. Take care of Eva and Lina, okay? But Hanif, my wife! We are going here, father. Haqi too. Haqi! - Haqi! - Haqi! Haqi! He is not here. Haqi! Haqi! Haqi? Haqi! I looked all over the place, dad. He is not here. - He was here? - Was. - Are you sure? - Have. Lina? Lina ?! Lina, what are you doing? Lina! This is so good. You are eating caterpillars, Lina! They are poisonous! Jef! What happened with me? Jef! Lina! Wake up! Haqi! Haqi! Honey? What's it? What was it dear? What happened? What the hell is going on, Nife? Who are these girls in these pictures? They... they were my colleagues. And that man is mr. Bandi? Did you know that? Mrs. Mirah was protecting these girls. That's why she was killed! And you and mr. Bandi tried to hide it all! Looks like... someone is trying to get revenge. Who? Who would do that, Nif? M. Siti. Who invited us to come here? Maman and Siti. Hanif! Hanif! Jef? Jef! Please, I have to take my wife to the hospital or she will die, Hanif. We cannot leave this place. You know it! What was our mistake? Nadya found this in mr. Bandi. I didn't know that... Who invited you to come here? Who invited you? Nif, Nadya, we look for Haqi all over the house but we can't find it. You bastard! Jef, Jef, Jef! Where is my son? Where's Haqi? Why did you invite us? We don't know. He... threatened us all. So, why didn't you say anything? We were afraid. Three girls... were taken... and locked in a room. He poisoned them. It was a warning that we shouldn't say anything. Me... I threw boiling water on my face on purpose, so that he never touched me again. Mrs. Mirah tried to protect these girls. But then Mr. Bandi falsely accused her. Until finally it was locked by Anton, Jefri and Hanif. Mrs. Mirah resorted to black magic s just to protect girls. She wanted to kill Mr. Bandi. But we don't know anything about it today. Maman and I have nothing to do with it. So why are you the only ones who are still alive? I wanted to protect the children. But honestly, lady... - I don't know anything. - Enough, Nif, enough. Help me! Maman? Siti? Maman. Siti. Help! Help! Mustika! Maman! Mustika... Mustika! Mustika! What we ran over was not a deer, dear. We have to go. Where are the others? Where are they? We are coming home... I don't know how... but the bus lost control. Then he stopped and a woman entered. And then... all the children seemed to be possessed by something. I didn't know what to do. I ran away immediately and ran. Nif, we have to find Haqi. Nif! I'd rather die alone and abandoned than meeting someone like you! Hanif! Enough! We have to find Haqi. We have to get out of here. Murni August 11, 1989 Go on! Go on! Yes sir. Yes sir. Hurry up. We will! We will! I know who did this. Murni. This is Murni, one of our colleagues. - Where is she now? - She disappeared. Help! Help... Help... - Help! - Haqi! - What happened? - It was an accident! Hurry, we have to go now. We will! We have to go! Dina, Sandi, come on! Jefri, we're leaving! Let's go! Get out! Haqi, what happened to you? Let's go home. We're going home. Oha, all the people you love. So when you lose them! Nif? Nadya... What happened with me? - Eva... - What do I have? Eva. Eva! Eve! Hey! Enough... Enough! Stop! Murni, stop! Hasbi, come in! Jef! Go inside! Hanif! Stop! Hanif... Hanif! Dina! Sandi! Hanif. Hanif! Hanif! Eve... Eve? Eve? Lina! Eve! Lina! Jef! Jefri! Eve! Open that door! Open that door! Maman! Maman! Siti! Leave them alone! Maman! Maman! Siti! Dina! Dina! Sandi! Dina! MOTHER! Sandi! MOTHER! Dina! Sandi! Dina! Sandi! Dina... Sandi! Stop it, you bitch! Hanif. Hanif... Hanif. Hanif! Hanif! Hanif! Hanif... Haqi! Nadya! My mother called me Murni. She wanted me to stay clean, away from Mr. Bandi. Unlike other girls in this orphanage. But she failed. You are all going to die here tonight. It's all your fault. We don't know that. That... it is also a sin, dear. Why did you kill all those kids on the bus? They had nothing to do with it. They are better dead than living in that place. I'm not here just to punish you. I'm here to create hell. You know why? Why... I'm not sure... if there is a hell after death. So, I want to make sure... that all of you are going to hell Leave my family out of this! What did my children do to you? Their father killed my mother. Don't be that way. Kill him. Kill your husband. And I release your children. NO! If you take too long... there won't be much left of your children for you to take home. Save them. Save the children. Save our children. Haqi... Haqi... How dare you! "Nobody's leaving! You are all going to die" Hanif! - Bye, Haqi! - Goodbye! Auntie Siti, where's Uncle Maman? He's at home, cooking. - To the car. We will. - Goodbye! - Hi, mom. - Hi son. - How was the school? - Nice. What we will eat today? Uncle Maman is making pizza. Yes. Javanese pizza. It's hot. Isn't it martabak? Uncle Jefri and Aunt Lina are coming. It's Aunt Lina's favorite. If it's just martabak, you could have ordered it. What is it, mother? Nothing. Yes. Yes, sir. Some minor changes to the construction will be necessary. We're going. Yes. Yes sir. Okay. We're done for today. We'll have to fix the road too. To facilitate access. Yes, it must be done by the end of the year. We can use ي for the New Year. - Back to the office, brother. - Okay. Can we stop by while we get back? - I think we can. - Cool.
