You want to be careful sitting there. Farmer might try and shoot you. I'm from Zimbabwe it wouldn't be the first time, trust me! - My name is Sibonakalisa. - Call me Hatter. Can you feel that? The energy. Always. That's why I'm here. There is something coming, I can sense it, and that's why I had to come. - From Zimbabwe? - No, Stonehenge. I was on a coach trip there but I knew I had to be here instead. I don't know what it is but whatever it is, it's something... -Something big! Exactly. Do you live here? Yes. What makes these circles? - I don't know. Why do they come here? - Because they have to. This is a customer service update. There are currently delays at Bank Station due to ongoing engineering works, and delays westbound on the Circle and District Lines. Your next station stop is Poplar. - You forget just how small England actually is. You can't go more than a couple of miles without coming across some village or town or some kind of sign of civilization at least. - You're clearly lost! - I'm not lost! Should've got a GPS. What do you want a GPS for? I don't trust them anyway. - That's because you always have a guide! - We don't need a guide to come to Wiltshire! - Then learn how to read a map. - I know how to read a map! I think it's out of date or broken or something. How on earth do we know where we are, anyway? We've been down a hundred identical little country roads and each one leads to another identical-looking Hobbit village. Which one did we just go through? I've no idea. They all look the same. All sound the same. - Dilton? - No. It's... Look there, we're there. - You just said you didn't know where you were! - I know where we are, we're there. Go right! Definitely, it's right. Do you think I like doing this? Do you think this is easy? If I had money I wouldn't be asking you, would I? Hang on. Ray you're a star, thanks mate. Marie, you alright? See you tomorrow. No, I haven't spoken to him. Well give me his new number then! Why not? Well, don't moan at me for not talking to him, then! Yeah! Look Caroline, I'm not going over this again. Just get him to call me, please. Please, Caroline, it's important. I'm going to get him involved in anything. There's nothing going on here anyway. He's a grown man for Christ's sake, he can make his own mistakes, can't he? Caroline. Caroline, I'm sorry. I mean it, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you. It's just that... ...today is Mum's birthday. And... ...I still love you. I know you don't. Just get him to call me, please. Perfect. I don't know what to do. Every choice I make is the wrong choice... ...and if I make a choice then change it to be the right choice it's still... ...the wrong choice. Caroline won't listen to me. Dean? Dean won't even talk to me, and... ...well you can't help me. Can you? Ah! Not now! Dean, I've had to get you in here today because... ...well as you know I've been going over the reports the last couple of days and I've had ever member of the team in here this morning. Unfortunately I need to say to you is that this is just not going to wash. There's no way that I can hand this work in above my head, because as it all comes down on me in the end, Dean. I don't know where you've been at these last few weeks but it's just not up to scratch. I'm gonna need to ask you to leave the office. Take at least a week out. Just get away somewhere, clear your head... ...and let's just hope that when you come back in here we'll get the old Dean back. Get back on track. - Okay. Okay, off you go. Just keep in touch with us. - I'm sure that was Stonehenge. - No, it was a fake. It's all made out of wood and fiberglass. The real Stonehenge is in a museum in Tokyo. Hmm. I'd love to touch the stones. Yeah? I did, when I was a kid. Mind you that was back before the National Trust Nazis got their hands on it. No, apparently you still can. On the solstice I heard there's an amazing rave. We should go! Have you ever seen a U.F.O? Excuse me while I write that down in my invisible book of favorite non-sequiturs! I'm serious! Come on, not even in the desert in Mali? You must have! No. Shame. I have. Oh look, Bilbo Baggins. Go and ask him where we are. Are you sure we can trust him? This is Wiltshire, the English countryside! What do you think he's gonna do, pull a gun on you? Farmers have guns, he looks like a farmer. But I don't think they tend to shoot journalists, even if we are lost. Excuse me mate, do you know where we are on this map? God, any later and we'd be here in time for the harvest. You know I'm beginning to see why everybody really wants to work with you! You weren't exactly my first choice, either! God knows why the agency sent you. I don't know. Maybe it's Written on the back of my Royal Television Society Camera Operator of the Year award! - It's getting cold. Goodbye Hobbiton, hello Narnia! Yeah that's right, go see if the Snow Queen's in, maybe you might find a friend. - Hi. - Hello. - Can we have two rooms please? - -Rooms? - To sleep in. - No rooms here. - How very Biblical! There's a campsite 'round the back. I'm not sleeping in a sodding tent! Well, why don't you sleep in the car and I'll sleep in the tent. Where's the nearest hotel? Pewsey, about five miles away. You come out of here, you turn left, then right on the main road, and you keep going and then you'll come to it. - You sleep in the car and I'll have the tent. - I brought two tents! -You knew about this didn't you? -Yeah, of course. It's called research. Okay, we'll take two tents just for tonight. Can I ask you a question? Have you ever seen a U.F.O around here? No, but I have seen lights though. Near enough everyone has. She's absolutely not my wife. Better make it a week, eh? - So Derren, you own the Barge Inn. - -We do. - You obviously attract loads of people coming here to... investigate. Yeah. A lot of tourists from all over the world. - Yeah, so what's your view on crop circles? Well, people say they're man-made some people say they're made by aliens. We just sell them beer while they talk about it really! The Barge Inn is in the book called the Fifty Strangest Pubs in Britain. We got a double-page spread in there, largely 'cause of the crop circle thing and because of the phenomenon and the strange people that come round here! - I hate to say that about my customers, but you know we are a diverse lot! Tomorrow we find a hotel. - Why? When I was in the Sudan we slept out under the stars. Yeah it's warm there. How come you always go to hot climates, anyway? The last assignment I had was in Finland. Don't they fight wars in temperate climates anymore? - Russian-Georgia War, South Ossetia, 2008. Mind you, that only lasted five days and it was in August. The day the penguins revolt in Antarctica, I'll happily wave you off at the airport. With all that cold air you should come with me, you'd fit in perfectly. - You making a documentary? Yes. Hi, I'm Lara. I'm here to find out the truth about crop circles. So is everyone else. - What do you think? Where do crop circles come from? - This is it. We're done now. - Whatever, you're full of shit. Excuse you? - Every time you give me this, then by Monday it'll be fine again. - This is just one of your... - Oh no, no, no, no, no! You wait until today, you just sit here and listen to me talk about my day and listen about everything that's gone wrong, and now you finish with this! Yes. Alright. - Alright? - Yeah. Maybe you should just leave then. -You're full of shit, Andrea. I get it now. -Is Andréa! Vaffanculo! Stop it. Fucking stop it! We're done and I'm going away. Hey, a mate of mine just told me there's some lights up there on top of a hill. - Great, thank you. - No worries. Follow me. - Here. - What's...? - Go! Now! Go! What is it? Is it an alien? - Are you ready? - So what happened last night? - Nothing. - What were you doing there then? - Nothing! - Look I'm here to find out the truth. Well I told you to leave and you didn't. You don't deserve the truth. -Okay, cut! What do you mean I don't deserve to know the truth? I'm a journalist, that's what I do. If I find a lead, I'm obligated to follow it. You need to report what they'll let you see! It isn't always the truth. Okay, I don't know what you were doing there last night, but if it gets me closer to my story I need to know. -You said you saw something in the field. Was it a crop circle? Well you're probably gonna find out anyway, so I might as well say yes. But how did you know it was there? Did you see lights or something? -I met a woman. She told me that something big was coming and we went to explore, and yes, we saw some lights. So they made the circle, the formation? Look, if you really want to know what's going on, don't hang around here. Get out there in the fields, and hills, and the ancient monuments. That's where the real Mecca of circle-makers is, not the bloody pub! When you want to learn just get out there and explore only then you can find out what you really want to know. But how long is that going to take? We're only here for a few days. Well I've been here fifteen years. - What about the woman you mentioned? Yeah sure, she's in the field. -What does she look like? Enlightened! God, he has this annoying ability to avoid questions. - Did you get all that? - No, because you told me to cut. No, just because I said cut doesn't mean stop filming! Always keep the camera on when someone's talking. You know, the last person who said that to me died two minutes later. This is not Syria, Yossi, and I'm not Olivia Cussen. - Hey! Don't mention her name in front of me. - Why? You're not half the woman she was, or the journalist. Look, somebody like Hatter doesn't respond to direct questioning. You need to cultivate him, make him feel secure, then he'll open up. Hatter?! Hatter, it's Yossi! Look, we're gonna head up into the field, anyway, see if we can dig something up, can you just tell us how to get there? Give me a lift and I'll show ya. - One appears in this field most years. Pisses the farmer right off. - I'm not surprised. Some get it and some don't. Those that live in their own little world, they get a bit annoyed, even violent. But those that get the bigger picture they tend to understand. There's more going on here than just crop circles, y'know. - Such as? - That's what I'm trying to find out. You alright? You seemed a bit shaken up last night. - No, I'm fine. I know how you feel. Being out here in the countryside away from.. ....whatever it was, is going to help you. - Well as long as there's not a war anywhere around here, I should be fine! I'll probably survive. - What's that? Oh, donation box. No way! Ha! So much for being irate! He'll probably make more from that the next few weeks than he would the entire crop. - Well, we don't have to pay do we? Depends how clear your conscience is, I suppose. - Are you sure this is where we were last night? - It's right there! Just keep walking. - Are you not joining us? - No. I do my research alone. Is it me, or is he a real arrogant son of a bitch? I think it's probably you. Welcome! They are called Izishoze Amatongo, the great circles of the Gods. They have been known for centuries throughout Africa. They are messages from the Star Gods placed only in sacred fields. - But who makes them? - Not who. What. -The legend says that a great circular disc-shaped force descends from the heavens and presses firmly into the ground. - They then swirl around creating circular patterns. These beautiful circles are a gift. A gift to humanity and our Earth. They help us understand who we are. Gaia is sick and she needs our help. So, this is an establishing shot of the formation before we do the interview... - Hey, what do you think you're doing? It's just a documentary. I don't want any filming here! Alright alright, calm down! Will you stop doing that, please? I'm nervous, alright? You told me that farmers didn't pull guns on people. I'll bloody shoot you if you get us lost again! -Don't blame me! - You're the one who wanted a guide and when we finally get one you left him up on a hill! He could be up there for bloody hours. God knows what he's doing up there. Are you filming me?! - You told me to film everything, remember? Not me! Cut it, please. I'm an history professor. - Oh, wow! And I'm very much interested here in the crop circles and in Avebury altogether. Because I already teach my students that from even in the 10th and the 11th century there was evidence from Monks who wroted down that they already saw crop circles. And perhaps some people pretended it is a hoax here but most certainly they did not do that thing in the 9th or 10th or 11th century. So I was lying on my back and I heard some... ...like whisperings. I sometimes hear the same when I enter some prehistoric caves, like, private prehistoric caves in the Périgord in France. It definitely feels that something comes out of the Earth, like out of Middle Earth, and connects something, whatever, with the Universe. It's like a sort of gateway, a kind of message between the Universe and the Middle Earth altogether, and it combines something. Surely it isn't made by humans. - Okay red pin, access denied. -Right, so that's most of them. - That's where we were last night, right? - -Yep. - Here we go, 25. Perfect. We're not going to get lost! - So you're a retired farmer? - A retired farm worker. I was in the combine going along merrily, listening to the radio, enjoying life I went into the circle watching everything, with a radio on, I've always had a radio on music, listening, and it just crackled and went dead. Came out the other side of the circle again, started up again. It erm... still now when I think about in now, I do... ...sometimes get a... I don't know. How are you feeling, Ken? Fine. - No feelings yet? - No. What's that on your arm? - You just cut yourself? - No. - No, I don't know how that got there. - Whoa! -No idea at all. - Doesn't hurt, no? - No, doesn't hurt. - Where's your car? - Don't have it anymore. - Don't worry, I've got something much better! - You live on this boat? - Yes. Sorry it's so small. Small! Dad, I live in London, this is big! I can just about afford a bedsit above a kebab shop. - I thought all you city guys were rich! - Not since the crash. Parking meters in Soho earn more per hour than me. Not so good for your self-esteem. So what's your plans now you're here? You're welcome to stay as long as you want. I've got to look after the campsite but still got plenty of time if you want to do something more interesting. -I'm not helping you, Dad! -I wasn't asking you to! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad, I need... Hey! Where's the brake on this? - [ ] Put it in reverse! -Where's reverse?! - [ ] Handle on the side! Chuck us the rope, just chuck us the rope, son. Wey! Got ya. - What you looking for? - Trying to find out where all the crop circles are. Saw a map like this in the café, trying to mark them on here. -I can help with that. My Dad makes me memorize them all. Says it's good for business. Your Dad? Your Dad runs the pub? There's me thinking you got the job because you're good looking! What's Salisbury plain? - Oh you can't go there. - Why not? - That's all army land. - The army? - Yeah, they're all over this place. Some people even say they make the crop circles. - Do they? - I don't think so. Who does? Dean! Hello Aideen! - Ow! - How are you? What's up? - New tattoo on my shoulder. - Oh, sorry! -Didn't think you were coming this year. -No, me neither Dad just asked me down for something. -Oh. Where is he? - He's in the barge. - Oh. He's making a documentary, and that's Lara. She's definitely not his wife. - Nice to meet you, I'm Dean. - Lara. - So is it true that everyone from Wiltshire is called a Moonraker? - Yes. - Is it because you really like James Bond? - No. - Because we're brandy smugglers. - What? Well, the original Moonrakers were brandy smugglers. Some of them were hiding barrels in the local pond using rakes to hold them down. When the customs officers asked them what they were doing they said they were trying to get the moon out of the pond because it had fallen in. They just thought they were a couple of stupid yokels, but they fooled them all. - Breakfast! - Local bacon, farm fresh. - Mmm, smells good! -Not here, though. - Hey! - Got to earn it! - How did you sleep? - Awful. Way too hot. -Come on get changed. - Where are we going? - Get changed! Okay. - What's with this white horse on the hillside? - Oh, there's loads of them. -Iron Age symbols of carriers of the souls carved into the chalk. -God knows why! That's a shame. It's only been there two days and the farmer's cut it out already. Come on. Brazilian? - Yep. Half. - So, you're way out of Your comfort zone here. How did you end up here? - Punishment for being able to speak English. - I work for a TV station in Brazil. Stupidly slept with the wrong person, and I'm suddenly the new European correspondent. Honeystreet isn't exactly the hub of European activity! - It is for a vindictive Program Controller obsessed with crop circles. And this is crop circle Grand Central Station, is it not? - True. I love this view. Where's Stonehenge? Stonehenge! Stonehenge! All the tourists wanna know where Stonehenge is! Sorry for sounding so predictable. The only positive I can get from this nonsense assignment is to go and party with the solstice lot. -Why? It's full of fakes and drunks! -Sounds perfect! I really want to go and touch the stones. I think that's my only chance, isn't it? If you want to touch stones you go to Avebury. Now. Best bacon in the county. It's cold! Unbelievable! - You know, he's way too young for you! And she's young enough to be your daughter. Hardly! Look, I'm cultivating a contact, You are just flirting. Why not? May as well have some fun, eh?! I'm not having sex with you. I was not asking! - Take your hat off. It started when I first saw lights over a field. First time I saw a formation. I see designs. Patterns. Firstly crude, rough outlines then more and more detail and the only way to make them stop is to get them down on paper. Where do they come from? I have no idea. But, sooner or later they all appear in a field. How often does this happen? More and more. Something big is coming. Why don't you go to a doctor? Get something for it, make it stop? That's what I'd do. Because they're what drew me here. They guide me. It's impressive but it's not the one. No, it's something bigger, think bigger, much bigger. What are you doing there? Oh, I'm measuring the E.M. The electromagnetic energy radiation coming from the field. After a crop circle appears we find the levels increase. - What causes that increase? - Now that we don't know. But the increase is pretty consistent across all genuine formations. It's one of the ways we differentiate from the hoaxes. The hoaxes? But this one's genuine, isn't it? Oh, this one's far too complex to be a hoax. There's no way this one's man made. Definitely extraterrestrial origin. - Hi, Charles. - Hi. I believe you run this café. Yeah, I run this crop circle information centre. I'm a field investigator for the crop circles. -I've been on the ground investigating the physical traces for 17 years right now. So 600 or so circles over 17 years. You know there's a huge proportion of these things which are hoaxed made by people, fakes. The spectacular thing comes in the smaller residual percentage which appear to be genuine, non-human made creations with no traces of physical damage to the plants or anything in that immediate environment, suggesting some kind of third party energetic process caused that to happen. So to me that's spectacular and interesting, you know, as investigations are ongoing. We had a message transmitted out into space in 1974 from the Arecibo Radio Telescope in Puerto Rico, and it was a message constructed by the Astronomer Carl Sagan. It was to launch the, um, to- to initialize that telescope, you know, it was the first process used was to send this message from humanity, we're here, this is our biology, this is where we are in our solar system in this part of space, and beamed it out to a star cluster named M13. Technically speaking that message shouldn't have even got there yet it's about 20 years down the road, interestingly enough, so we get the reply before the actual message gets there. Assuming that the reply was a genuine crop circle rather than a human hoax. Basically the message back was very similar to the message that we sent out, except there was, um- where in our original message there was a depiction of the human double-helix strand of DNA in the reply there was a triple-helix suggesting, if you tend to believe this kind of thing, that whatever these entities or beings were, they were operating using... ...far more sophisticated biological processing systems incorporating the use of a triple spiral DNA rather than a double spiral DNA, which would mean presumably massive more intelligence. I've had, over the 17 years, I've had what I would consider to be bizarre close encounters with... with... ...energies, or objects, orbs of light, mainly, you know. On one occasion an orb of light round about 2 feet in diameter, as big as a large beach ball, physically approached me in a crop circle and came within about 2 feet of me. And this was a large orb of light which just appeared out of nothing hovered above the ground right in front of me for up to a minute, just under a minute, maybe. And that was a weird close encounter. Ta. I can't do it, Dad. - I need your help. - No, you don't. Just get the normal team together, I haven't helped you for years. They don't understand me like you do. Understand what I need. - Why do you think I asked you here? - I'm not doing it. This is your life now, not mine. Dean, please. We're a team! It's what we do! No Dad, it's what you do. Yeah I used to have fun when I was a kid running around in the fields and that, but... I'm not doing it anymore. Just think about it. I got to go. You have that. Dean! What's your Dad like? - Obsessed! No, that's not fair. He does what he can. - He knows a lot about crop circles! - -More than anyone. -So why won't he talk to me? - Probably because he doesn't trust you. He said that I didn't deserve to know the truth and that when I'm ready, I'll know. How do I know when I'm ready? - You don't. - You did say you wanted to touch the stones, didn't you! - Oh, my God! That one over there. -Yeah, go on. - What's going to happen to me? - Huh? - What's going to happen to me? - People have disappeared! - Have they? - Yeah, yeah, yeah! - People have been sucked straight into the stones. I'd like to disappear with you! -If you're lucky. - I did it! I touched the stones! - You touched the stones! Give me that. -There you go. - Okay work it, baby, work it! - It's like stones calendar! - Yes! -Push your bottom out. - What, like that? - Yeah. - I feel like I'm being searched. - Amazing! It's mad, you almost forget. Better than Stonehenge? Turn it off and come here. Turn it off! - No! - Come on! No! Oh! God dammit! Come on. Come on! I think we're being kidnapped. Hey. Hey! Jesus, where were you? Syria. Aleppo. Suleiman district. I was there last year. If you don't confront it, it's never gonna go away, you know. Sometimes in my work... ...the camera and the gun are seen as the same thing. We were filming in a souk... ...well, what's left of one. It was just a facade of buildings and a pile of rubble, really. At one end was a tank... ...and the other was our guide. He was just a kid, really, teenager. Olivia, the reporter I was with, she had a son about the same age. Had a kind of maternal bond with him. He was stuck... and she told me to keep filming while she went to save him. They were both killed by a single tank shell. It then turned its barrel on me. It knew where I was. I tried to hide in a doorway. The building collapsed, it all went dark... and I woke up three days later in a Jordanian hospital. A video tape in my pocket wrapped inside a note thanking me for my bravery. I tried for months to get it on TV. I couldn't find a station who would run the footage. All said it was too graphic. So no-one saw it... and the best journalist I ever worked with died for nothing. They both did. Yeah, I saw the darkness in your eyes. I guess you'd know about that. You know, this- this is a very ancient site. Thousands of years ago people came from all over Europe just to be here. It's a gateway, it's full of their energy. If you let it, it will heal you. Mate, it can't be done. Anything can be done. Give me the clothes. Let's go. - Have you ever seen a UFO? What? That's just not the question I was expecting right now! Well? No, I've never seen a UFO. Mmh. I'd love to see one here. Well this is a big military area... so most of the people who said they've seen UFOs have probably just seen planes. Why are the military here? Maybe they make the crop circles! - It's not the military... and it's not the UFOs. How can you be so sure? The way the crop is bent and never broken. The way they interlace patterns that can only ever be seen from the sky. This one must be amazing! What? What's so funny?! Nothing, just... you're the first person to see this crop circle. How do you know? Because it was put down last night. But who? Who made it? You're asking the wrong question there. The real question is why. I should hate you for doing that, but I don't. If you were in the pub, I'd have thrown you out before midnight. Now, come on! Come on! Okay. So... this whole thing started in the late 1970s... these two old boys called Doug and Dave. Doug had spent some time in Australia and one day, in a pub... he decided to tell Dave about these saucer nests that were appearing in Queensland... ...and they thought it would be fun to do the same. Make a circle in a field. Okay. Why? Well, there's loads of UFO spotters in the area... and they thought it would be funny if they could hoax them into thinking that a UFO had landed. Just some pointless prank fueled by too much beer and cheese rolls. But it worked! People believed, and still do believe, that it was made by UFOs. And this went on for 13 years. They made bigger and better designs as they went until one day they just retired in 1991... and that was when they told everyone it was a hoax. But by that point, they had people copying them. But there have been thousands of them made. How come no-one's ever been caught before? They're made in waist high crops away from main roads. A couple of years back two formations went up in the same field and neither of the teams knew the other were there! Unless you exactly when it's gonna be made and at what time the chances of finding them are practically zero. - But loads of people do believe they are aliens. There's a whole cottage industry around it. Yeah... and it brings a lot of money to the area. It's why the farmers turn a blind eye provided they get their little donations in their little boxes. Some'll try and shoot you. Most are all right. And what about the last 20 years? I mean, it's easy to make a few circles in a field but these designs, they're huge. Hundreds of meters long. Natural evolution. Tons of teams in the area... and they're all challenging each other to make bigger and better designs. We place them on ley lines, next to monuments... and orientate them in particular directions and the world just laps it up! Assuming it's some gift from the heavens. So the whole mystery is nothing but a huge hoax? Yeah. Just some pointless British eccentricity. Like pantomimes. Or the Royal Family. - You know, you should come here in the winter time. You can see the outlines of the crop circles in the snow. You know, this is the only pub in the world built inside a stone circle! A chapel too. Does give me the creeps though. Makes me feel like I'm in a horror movie! "Don't look at the stones, don't look at the stones!!" Sorry I ran out on you last night. That's all right. You didn't miss much. I was expecting Druids. That's Stonehenge. Yeah, all rich kids on one side wearing antlers and pissheads into King Arthur shit on the other! Not really my scene. Not really yours either, I guess. What did you get up to in the end? I go where the Spirits guide me. My head is far too sore for an answer like that! When you've witnessed the darkness of humanity... you have to expose yourself to the light. Find your balance... and keep your head clear. Well, at least we know we're not in a horror movie otherwise I wouldn't get a signal! Hello, spoke too soon! It's the Ice Monster! Hello, Lara! No, I'm in Avebury. Why is that ironic? He's here with me... and that barmaid you like so much. Yeah, okay. Alright. Bring the camera! Lara's coming here with Dean. Apparently she wants to interview you. - I would like to ask you one question. Why? - Why what? - Why make crop circles? I don't know, that's what I'm trying to find out as well. But you must know why you make them. Who says that I make them? No, no, no no! Cut it! Cut it! I asked you here to help me not destroy everything we have! What difference does it make, Dad? Like, she was gonna find out eventually. Do you know how many documentary teams have been here over the years searching for the truth? There's a reason they keep searching! We don't bloody tell them! I'm sorry! Alright. I'm sorry. It just slipped out. We got a bit carried away and it just slipped out, all right? Let your soul guide you, not your selfish pleasure! I mean, if you can't learn that, then all the private education and university degrees in the world are gonna be worthless. You know what? Enough with your spirit guide shit, Dad! I don't understand it. I never have! Look, this is your thing and I'm happy for you. But I'm not gonna let your ritualistic spiritual shit dictate my life anymore! Alright? Look, maybe that's why she's here. Maybe she's here to show you why you really do it. What we see in a circle tells us everything about ourselves. I mean... just look at it as a huge Rorschach design deciphered specifically according to the minds that chose to look at them, to read them. It's like a temporary temple. Some people wanna be there to dance. Some people wanna be there to meditate. Some people just wanna explore. But they just feel compelled to be there just as we feel compelled to make them. It's like a- it's like a mind virus that you just can't shake. I can't tell you why I make them. I just have to. Then let me help you find out. It's too late. I'm not doing this anymore. What the hell happened here? Did you break the camera? I stopped recording. What! Why? This is the best footage we've got, a confession! What the hell were you thinking? I agree with them, okay? And I just think if we expose what they're doing, we're gonna end it and we don't have that right. We have the right to reveal whatever is in the public interest. We are here to observe and document, not to get emotionally involved. You've crossed the line, Yossi. Whatever happens keep filming. You never, ever stop. Why have we stopped? You need to bin the story. Never! People need this. No. No you need this. There's more at stake here than just your stupid career. Think about it. You're right. I need this story and I'm going to get it. At what cost?! If you expose the circle makers then you're gonna force them to stop and then everybody is gonna lose everything, and why? Just so you can make some name for yourself! It's a chance for me to go home! I haven't seen my family in 5 years. I was sent on this bullshit assignment as a way to justify keeping me here. Give her an impossible task and make her fail. You know what? I won't. People in Brazil don't give a shit what happens in Europe, as much as Europeans care about what happens in Brazil! Then why don't you quit? Why don't you quit? Go on! You got any bars on yours? - I didn't bring mine. - Damn it! I'm sure the financial world will survive a few days without you opening their post for them! Hey! It's a good entry-level job, all right? Fast-track. To what? Someone opening your post for you? What do you think of this one? Yeah, it's alright. The edges are a bit shonky. Left a load of loose bits up. I never leave bits standing up. You used to spend whole summers up here with me, now I barely see you and when I do finally see you you're off with someone else. - You jealous?! - Disappointed. She used you to get the story on your Dad and you fell for it. No, I can't believe he's just gonna give it all up. He's been talking about it for months, said he wanted to go out with something big. - He really said that? He's been looking for a new job, had no luck though. My dad's retiring soon, letting me take over the pub. - I was gonna ask Hatter to run it with me, but not now. People only come here to see the circles. If there's no circles there's no people and... there's no pub. Aideen said that you'd be here. She also said this was your secret hiding place. Well it's not very secret, obviously! Come and hug the tree with me! Nah. I saw enough of that Hippy stuff when I was in India on my way to Kashmir. Oh, Yossi! This-this yew tree is 1800 years old, okay. It's seen the end of the Roman occupation. The Anglo-Saxons, the Dark Ages. Two plagues, a civil war and a blitz. It's also the oldest living thing you'll ever get to touch. Come and hug the damn tree with me! I'm sorry about Lara. She has a reputation for being a bit obsessive. I did try to talk her out of it. She has to do what she feels is right. Just like we all do. - Yeah. I've seen what obsessive journalism does to people. Pursuit of the story at all costs. - Syria? - Yeah. Among others. It's pretty impressive what you do, you should get some acclaim for it. I don't think it's acclaim I'll be getting once this all comes out. Why not? You're an artist. You're a real life Moonraker. You fooled the world. Yeah, and now I'm gonna pay for it. It's okay, I'm ready to give it up, anyway. Are you kidding? You're like the Banksy of the countryside! I only did it to be close to my son. I shouldn't have fucking done it. I shouldn't have done it, Dad, I'm sorry. After all you told me, I didn't believe it. I don't believe that... and I don't think you do either. Bought a lovely new camera the other day. Nightvison. Infrared. Gives a lovely sort of pinkish hue to it. Not like the normal sickly green horror movie look you normally get. - I'd like to come out with you one night. Film you in a field putting a formation down. I've spent most of the last few years just stuck in conflict zones. Wars. Be nice to film something creative for once, instead of something being destroyed. You can tell Lara she can say what she wants about me. You as well. Have you seen Dean? - No. - So, what do we do? - Just stay behind me. Do you want me to finish this formation? Help me find a way out! Help me! - What happened? Tape measure got tangled. Pattern's off design. - How do you know that? - What are you going to do? - Fill in that area. - What! Me! No way! I-I can't. - You can do this. - Hatter, I think we should get out of here. Not until we finish. - I saw something. - What? - Back down there. A figure, a shape, something. I don't know what it is. It's protecting us. Protecting us from what? - From him! - Hatter! - I knew it was you! I knew if I waited long enough I'd catch you at it! - OUT! - You've been warned. Now get out of my field! - I'm not going anywhere, Kelsey. - I warned you, Hatter. I said get out of my field, Hatter! Not tonight. You'll have to shoot me. - Get out. Get out, Hatter! - I got to finish this. - Shall we finish this? - How can you tell you finished it? - I just know. - It was amazing! Thank you so much. So now what? - Now I'm free. I won't make any more. -What? You have such a gift! I won't expose your name, and I'll cover your face, I promise. Doesn't matter. My time is up. Someone else needs to do it now. Are you smiling? Yeah. I'm going back to Brazil. Lucky you. I'm going back to work. Egypt. You covered up that mistake well, mate. I didn't do that middle bit. Who did? No-one.
