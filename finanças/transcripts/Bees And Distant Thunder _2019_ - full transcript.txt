I don't know when I remember... but... What is certain is... that was when I was just a toddler, the light poured down. Bright and powerful sound... trembled the world. The 10th Yoshigae International Piano Competition Stage 1: November 9-13 She is Eiden Aya The child who used to rely heavily on her mother. Everyone calls her a girl prodigy... She also played a concerto in Carnegie Hall. She disappeared for a while. In other words, she will never come back. honestly She won't go on strike again. After 20 years old, she is an ordinary person. Is she Eiden Aya? Yes How many years have passed? It's been a long time, for seven or eight years? Are you Ms. Eiden? Yes. Please wait here. Ms. Eiden is here. No. 44: Eiden Aya (Japan) Honeybees and Distant Thunder Stage 1 of the Yoshigae International Piano Competition Hello Hello Did anyone impress you today after stage 1 of reviews is over? Some Compared with previous years, the level of contestants this year is quite high. Our ears are also much satisfied. Lee from this competition... Later won the championship in the Chopin Piano Competition. The Yoshigae Piano Competition is therefore regarded as a springboard for young pianists. Will the second Lee be born in this competition? The review has just begun and I'm inconvenient to express personal opinions but... compared with previous years, there are many talented players. Anyway, I think for them,.. It is crucial to winning in this competition. Thank you. Then, see you. Thank you. We are coming to you from the 10th Yoshigae Piano Competition. In a period of two weeks and after pre-selections Only 6 will proceed to the finals This year, there were a record-breaking 512 applicants from 53 countries and one region. The 24 contestants that were selected for stage 2 will be announced after the jury meeting today. Well well Isn't this the jury chairperson, herself? Recently, I've read an article that even a pianist can lose stamina by excessive smoking. You are the one that needs to give the alimony. Be careful By the way Your favorite disciple He is quite a charm. Pure perfection. Just like your pianism. What more can we expect that perfection? In the end, Masaru is going to win. Thank you He is very popular like an idol. Prince of Juilliard School. He is a popular contestant in this competition. but This is just a small place in Japan. Isn't the competition too big? Don't you know? Among the previous winners in this competition... someone became a star. So, this CD may be appreciated in the future too. Masaru Oh yeah Don't you think the high notes fall flatten the piano? Oh really? Sorry I didn't notice it. Yesterday was better, definitely. You know the tuner, right? Oh yeah, I know him. Tell him I'm not happy. I cannot afford to sound like the rest of these amateurs. Ok Thanks Who was that just now? Jennifer Chen Enrolled at the Julia School as Masaru Carlos Also a highly anticipated new star. But our interviewee is not her. Sorry, I'm late. You are 2 minutes and 30 seconds late. You waited too much. What happened? I brought a photographer today. Take it for now. Will this be broadcasted nationwide? Yeah everyone will see. No, no, you have to tell me in advance. My family might watch. Really, you always worry about that. How should i answer these questions? I will ask you questions so you will be fine. No, even if you say there's no problem... -How is it? -Wait for a while Will this picture be put on TV? The participant who barely meet the age limit, Takashima Akashi... Prepares for the final contest while working in the Iwate Musical Instrument Store. Most of the participants he is facing are college students of the Conservatory of Music. We are taking into account the disadvantages of the work and family. How far can "ordinary people's music" go? It's embarrassing. It feels like "Rocky" although I don't hate it. It's not easy to tell the truth. Mr. Takashima, we are ready, please. Wait, there is another Japanese. The one that abandoned her concert 7 years ago. The girl prodigy who disappeared, Eiden Aya. She is already 20 years old. For her, it's her comeback as well as her last chance to shine. I'm sure she will pass stage 1. But her glory days are over. Attention all contestants.. Results of Stage 1 of pre-selection Will be announced in the lobby at 18:00. All contestants are invited to gather in the lobby. Ms. Eiden It's time to play. Aya Are you Masaru? I am a Masaru. Masaru, why are you here? You are really Aya! Yes. I saw the list of contestants and I can't believe it. More than ten years have passed since then. Masaru Aya After that, you should keep practising the piano as you promised, right? Of course How is the teacher? That Mom died 7 years ago. Sorry. I'm so sorry. It's ok, really. Do you remember that we used to play with four hands? Of course, I remember. Aya's mother is the teacher who taught me the fun of playing the piano. Thank you I was really happy back then. Masaru was so small and also a crybaby, right? I'm not a crybaby now. Really? Masaru I have been looking for you. That tuner is making a joke out of me. You need to come with me. -Okay -Come Sorry, Aya. Wait for a while. I'm surprised. Hello, I am a reporter for "Classical Trend". Ms. Eiden, can you say something? Sorry Okay, everyone. Now, for the final contestant, Kazama Jin. Him? I don't believe it. Horrible You think so? Truly horrible. Does he think Beethoven belong to romantics? His performance was almost blasphemy. I think he has enormous talent. At least, I want to listen to his performance in the next stage. That's out of the question. He is still 16. So what? What more could you hope for? He should get a better teacher. What is this? Letter of recommendation From Yuji von Hoffman. Is the letter authentic? Yes, it's definitely his handwriting. Dear Jury, I give you Kazama Jin. He's literally a "gift" most likely from heaven to us. However, make no mistake. He's not the one who is tested. It is I and every one of you. When you experience him, you will understand what I mean. He is not a sweet grace. He is poison. To accept him as a true "gift" or to conclude him as a "disaster", it is after you... or rather all of us. Yuji von Hoffman The tone has changed completely. Listen It become like this. Yeah The sound will indeed change with different pianists. But will there be such a big change? Is there a list of contestants? It's here The last one to play Yamaha is... Sorry. Kazama Jin Stage 1 of pre-selection review results announced Looking for someone? No, nothing. Why are you so nervous? It seems so? Indeed. Contestants and related staff have really worked hard in Stage 1. The level of this competition is quite high. Contestants have no difference in playing skills and left a deep impression on us. So, even if you are lost in this competition, It does not mean that we deny your musical talents. Please understand that. Then The list of Stage 1 of pre-selection will now be announced. The first one is A little bit further. Down? Right is better. Ok? Return This, is it? Ok Ok Thank you This must be sent to Machiko Yeah, since it's the most troublesome for my family. No, everyone is proud of you. Come on, dad. Don't call me dad. See you tomorrow Goodbye Congratulations Is this your comeback competition? But for Ms. Eiden, we take it for granted. Actually, I I've been listening to your performance since before. My favourite is "Prokofiev Piano Concerto No. 3" Thank you No I finally passed Stage 1 of pre-selection. I'm almost over the age so this is the last time for the competition. If I lose this time, I should give up the path of music. Me too what? If I fail this time, I will stop playing the piano. I want to give it a try in the competition. I always felt that I was happier playing the piano before and happier. I am super happy. I enjoy it a lot. Being able to come back here... By the way, the Japanese girl you were with today... She was the child prodigy that was famous years ago, right? Yep You know her? Yeah, a little bit. When we were kids, she lived nearby. You better watch yourself, tho. What? If I were you, I would not hang out with such an unlucky girl. She might steal your luck away. Just meeting her, I remember something I forgot about. In the past, There is something beyond perfection. Stage 2 of qualifiers November 14-16. "Spring and Asura" A new song created from the inspiration of Miyazawa's poems. Composed tracks for Stage 2 Qualifiers. The second half of cadenza, please compose and play based on your personal understanding. (Cadenza: a moment devised by the composer for the soloist to show off.) Are you ready for Cadenza, Masaru? My cadenza With reference to teacher Nathanielâ€™s suggestion I took the score very seriously. Is it my proud work? Aya, how about you? I'm not ready yet. What a surprise. You should be very good at this. Aren't you used to improvise with the teacher's accompaniment? That's not counted, that one is... The feeling of playing together with my mother. Although it's just for fun, it's also very powerful. If the teacher is still alive, It feels like Aya, you might just go on stage and improvise. For me, the piano I played with Aya and teacher is... like a toy box that can make any sound. Toybox Where did that sound go? But you are really disgusting. Obviously, you don't have such a difficult problem. Isn't this a problem? Because this time the contestants are very high. It's better to sift out those who can't. -right? -Um... this is marvellous We can only test the true calibre of the contestants. I would love to play it myself. In short, this piece of music was meticulously composed to remember Huffman. But I can't guarantee it. Anytime Ok Stage 2 of qualifiers "Spring and Asura". No 55: Masaru Carlos Revy Anatoru (19 years old USA) Cadenza He played the octave movement with subtlety. But in this case Does this piece only highlight cadenza? no problem He is deliberately controlling Hi, brother Hi, sir What was that? What was what? I told you it would be too risky to take the octave passages in stage 2. Oh yeah sure but I was able to pull it off, right? Do you think you can become Horowitz or Richter? Noâ€¦ Throwing away the naive, narcissistic ego that you have. And make it perfect performance. That is what demanded of pianist, here and always. Will you really be ok? Only two months left before the competition. I still ask you to pick up Akihito from school. Of course, your work is also busy, right? Even if I say to you, "Sometimes don't practise the piano". You don't listen at all. I can notice after a day of rest. The critics will notice after two days of rest. If three days off,.. The audience will notice. Isn't there a proverb? My competitors are music college students practising in the piano room all day long. So, I can't rest. "Spring and Asura" There seems to be a famous sentence in it. Ah found it. What does this sentence mean? "Ameyuju" is "Snow". "Totechi" is "Take" "Kenja" is "Reward" Before Miyazawa's sister died, Because she doesn't want her brother to see her dying.. she finally ask him to take a bowl of snow from the courtyard. Does that mean like that? "Give me a bowl of snow". Give me a bowl of snow Why? Give me a bowl Slightly wrong, Lord Akihito Snow Give me a bowl Wrong That's wrong Music is something from life So, the players should be ordinary people, right? Although this sounds like an excuse for someone with a broken dream.. But, this is the so-called "ordinary people's music". It definitely contains the movements that people who simply live by music can't reach. What do you think of this cadenza? Although my mind frequently think of the scene of searching But I still feel a bit heavy. Ok Still feel a bit heavy. But I don't know much about music. You see, after all, it's just a layman's opinion. If you can't hear, I don't have the qualifications of a pianist. No problem, I heard Akashi's performance is the same as Argerich. That is completely different. I am more rooted in life. I want to excite a layman like Machiko. Make music that kids like Akihito can understand. Sorry I am a little upset as the competition approaches. It's ok. I'll change it later by myself. Thank you It's okay. Let's go. Come on, Akashi. Stage 2 of qualifiers "Spring and Asura" No. 74: Akashi Takashima (28 years old Japan) I'm always thinking what exactly is "ordinary people's music". That's the music that only I can create. I integrated this element into it. So the finalized cadenza is.. Snow Give me a bowl Give me a bowl Cadenza Sticker: Do a good job! Give me a bowl of snow Excuse me Is there a free piano room now? Let me see... Everyone is using it now. How long shall I wait? There is a free time room B. What time is it? But it was immediately booked by the next contestant. I can't make a booking today. If it's convenient for you tomorrow morning... I want to book now. It must be today. I'm sorry, it really doesn't work today. Excuse me. Ms. Eiden, what's wrong with you? You have worked hard. You too I am looking for a usable practice room. But it doesn't seem to be empty. It's embarrassing, sorry. No If you donâ€™t mind... If you don't mind the manufacturer I know there is a place where you can play the piano. Can I introduce it to you? Ah, that... Ah, you were introduced by Akashi? Yes Akashi's performance I watched online is really good. How to say? It is commendable "cut off the corners". Although it is slightly inferior to the piano used for competition... But the sound is very soft and good, right? It feels like the sound immersed in the piano all year round. Just like old furniture Then I'll go back to the studio and work. Ok, thank you very much. My cadenza My "Spring and Asura" -Excuse me -eh? I think you must follow wherever you can play the piano. Can I play with you? This melody always echoed in your mind, right? Uncontrollably want to play it, right? Me too You really like piano. I like it very much How about you? I like it too How much do you like it? Why? Don't I look like I like piano? Well But every time you get off the stage.. You always look very confused. I like piano very much. How much do you like it? Well.. "Even if I am the only one in the world, As long as there is a piano in the wilderness.. I can bounce to the end", I like that much. Even if there is no listener? Yes Isn't this how music exists? If it's you, Even if you are the only one in the world You will certainly sit in front of the piano. Like this? Ah sure it is It's pretty. Debussy's "Clair de Lune" My dad is a beekeeper Because of dad's work, I moved to France with dad when I was four. Dad works around in Europe, I follow along. Huffman gave me a wooden silent keyboard. I always use that to practice. But if you win the competition, Dad promised that he would buy me a piano. So I have to work hard. Is this why you entered? No, there is another reason. Other reasons? The last day of stage 2 of preliminaries. Hello First, let me tell you your performance was amazing. Really? Did you like it? It was great. Thank you. Thank you so much. You must have felt it. Here Excuse me. Stage 2 of the preliminaries "Spring and Asura". No. 20: Jin Kazama (16 years old, Japan) Is this why you entered? There are other reasons. Other reasons? I have a promise with Mr. Hoffman. Promise? Mr. Hoffman often said Listen Jin, listen It means music is hidden in every corner of the world. Listen to it. Mr. Huffman said let me play such music. Let me find someone who plays such music. Do you mind if we just...? Oh yeah, sure. Look at his fingers Really amazing I just played very cool. It's so enjoyable to play the piano in the concert hall. Yes. Are you ready, Ms. Eiden? Yes Good luck Thank you I will listen in the auditorium Stage 2 of the preliminaries "Spring and Asura". No 44: Aya Eiden (20 years old, Japan) She's about to reach cadenza This is really wonderful. Liszt - Mephisto Waltz No. 1 Next, it will be the review stage. The results of Stage 2 of preliminaries Will be announced in the lobby at 6 pm Hello Hello Let's start the interview if you are ready I'm okay, really. Is that ok? What is my mood now? How to say I lost Ordinary people's music..... Failed that Just for now.. My music life.... Chapter One... ended. Ended. I just need to focus on my next performance, probably. At Queen Elizabeth Competition. I will improve myself. Why you? I practised so hard while you are gone for 7 fucking years. This is unfair. Why? Think of a small number that will make it as pianists. Those who don't make it.. become teachers. Just play for fun or... just quit. So where are the true geniuses then? What is this obsession with trying to prodigies? Where does this guilty feeling come from? It's easy. It's the inferiority complex. We are not geniuses that made history, that's it. indeed That's a harsh one. Yes So cold I told you that the beach is very cold. Who told you to come here? If I remember right it's him Mozart Mozart? Is it "Serenade"? Yes Next is me! let me do it what is this Can't see at all lying It's really great what? The world of pianists. Laymen like me really do not understand. Chopin from childhood... They have dedicated most of their time to the piano. Only determined to be a pianist. and lived like this, didn't they? Yes That is.. Although I don't want to admit it, I don't really understand too. Their world. Jin I seem to hear something. What? I seem to hear something. Here The world is making a sound. Finals Orchestra: New East City Philharmonic Conductor: Masayuki Onodera 6 finalists play their chosen concerto Rachmaninoff: Piano Concerto No. 3 by Masaru C.L.Anato (US) Prokofiev: Piano Concerto No. 2 by Stephano Angeretty (Italy) Rachmaninoff: Piano Concerto No. 2 by Kim Soo Jung (Korea) Bartok: Piano Concerto No. 3 by Jin Kazama (Japan) Prokofiev: Piano Concerto No. 3 by Aya Eiden (Japan) Chopin': Piano Concerto No.1 by Frederick Demy (France) Good morning master. Good morning Mr. Onodera Mr. Takubo long time no see Welcome to Yoshigae I am not interested in Yoshigae But this concert hall is very good No wonder you have to work here I feel really sorry for the contestants this time. With that Masayuki Onodera conducting Good morning, everybody Good morning Although this is a piano competition,.... We only focus on making "real music". There must be some unrealistic pianists in this competition. But whether our accompaniment and their performance are in sync... Depends on what level they are. This is not something our band should consider. We don't need to cater to them. To lower our playing level. Then, we start from the beginning. He is too good, very good. Not to me, that elegant prick. Why did he decide to take this competition offer? Because of Mr. Hoffman. Rumor has it that it was Mr. Hoffman brought him from the Berlin Philharmonic. What means Mr. Onodera is the second assistant from the piano god. Final rehearsal Mr. Onodera This is Masaru Carlos Levy Anatoru Please Nice to meet you. It is a great honour to cooperate with the world's top conductors. So, where do you plan to enter the accompaniment? Prokofiev Piano Concerto No. 2 is I heard you used to get along well. No. 102 of the fourth movement starts here. I want to invite you to conduct the orchestra to match my timing and come in at free speed Can we try it once together now? Then, let's go. Thank you all Thank you I feel the flute doesn't seem to fit well with me. Can I do it again? Ok, starting with No. 102. Thank you all Thank you Can i do it again? Thank you all thank you, thanks Stop thanks Here, I want to hear the flute. Is it ok? There is no problem here. Ah no problem, no problem. I can hear clearly here. First of all, how do you cooperate with the orchestra conductor? Yes By the way, how does the key feel? no problem It was totally fine to listen in the auditorium just now It's just an error, don't worry too much. Excuse me I still think the beginning of the fourth movement... Your time is over Sorry, the next rehearsal is about to start What are you doing? What? What? Is the rehearsal fun? Ah.. It's more difficult than solo. Why did I choose Prokofiev Piano Concerto No. 2? Umm. I... I like all the songs of Prokofiev very much. I always feel that his music makes people want to dance. Dance? Yes If I were a dancer, I would definitely like to dance his music I heard Piano Concerto No. 2 ... The evaluation was particularly low when it was first debuted. After Diaghilev listened to this song, he immediately asked Prokofiev for his ballet. Wisdom is really insightful. Dance with Prokofiev's tune? Why? No, I just never thought about it. Masaru Why did you choose Prokofiev's song? Because Prokofiev is... Not only a well-known composer As a pianist, his performance is superb. I have an idea. I seldom told anyone but In the future I want to be a... pianist who can compose independently. Pianist who can compose independently Nowadays, It's hard to find a pianist who can compose independently. Young people like us... just like listening to popular new songs.. Let's enjoy Rachmaninoff's new song, like this, right? I always feel that classical music is like being bound sealed in an enchantment. I want to break the shackles and rush out of this barrier again. To create neo-classical music. I have always had such a dream. I feel particularly good. What about Aya? Why did you choose Piano Concerto No.3? This is myâ€¦ This is my homework. Great to find you Ms. Eiden. Mr. Kazama's rehearsal ended early. Is it convenient for you to start 20 minutes in advance? no problem Thank you Then please start to prepare to play. He just confirmed the place and left without playing. Kazama Jin, that kid, will he really be ok? This is his first time playing a concerto, right? Move a little over here and there. Are we chess pieces? He dares to point fingers in the face of Onodera Masayuki. He has guts. Do you have any requests? Like the speed of the tempo... Or to confirm the coordination details of a certain movement? Ok... Actually, I have no special requests. Ok. Please. (Prokofiev: Piano Concerto No. 3) No. 18 Sorry I can't here the piano sound Ready to do it again, 18 Last 5 minutes Finale Chapter 131 Should i congratulate? Thank you This is my last chance Next I will continue to work hard too. If you want to quit This is also the last chance what? If you are not conscious about why you want to be a concerto pianist. Really, it is a tragedy. Can I say honestly? Your performance just now.. It seems like how my piano sounds were young. how to say Lack of a sense of life This is just a missed opportunity to stop. A small suggestion from the former girl prodigy. Yoshigae International Piano Competition will reach the finals tomorrow. This 10th Memorial Concert.. Only the last song left. The significance of this year's concert is.. Not only the 10th anniversary. It is also a sad farewell for our industry. Since then, there is one less treasured master in the world. Needless to say, everyone should also know that I am referring to Yuji von Hoffman. His music makes people listen. I can't help but sigh to the beauty and incredibleness of music. Its player is a little person sitting on the piano stool. Born from the fingertips of the player.. is a fleeting note. But at the same time... There are still invisible things that will last forever. Through the limited, fleeting music. We can touch "eternity". Only the true players can express such emotions. It is no doubt that Yuji von Hoffman can be called such a piano master. It's said that we can catch up with the vigil before the spirit that starts at 8 pm. it's ok, no problem The concert will end at 6pm Hey guys She is still a child The mother just died Ms. Eiden, it's time to play. Finals: November 23 Contest is about to start Finals: November 23 Finals: November 23 The judges are invited to gather in the meeting room. Aya Is there a problem? Piano Concerto No. 2 I can play. Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No.2 I played before. But this is not good, Aya, you will be playing soon. It won't take long. Just concentrate on the fourth movement. See, it pops out! It is! So it is like that... It turned out to be like this. The rhythm here is slightly... Crybaby Masaru ....can play so grand now. Music like the sea I'm just constantly catching up with Aya's pace. Masaru It will be okay. Ok Aya Yes? You are finally back. What do you mean? I will listen carefully. Ok Do you best. No. 55: Masaru Carlos Levi Anatoru (19 years old, USA) Prokofiev Piano Concerto No.2 Op.16 It's amazing It's like he can intoxicate the whole auditorium. Not just the auditorium Seems to make the whole world fall for it. Thank you It's nothing Seeing talented people like you... I think there is a voice telling me that you can continue. Although the chance to play in front of so many people may no longer exist. Sure enough, I Can't live without a piano. Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ Iâ€¦ This time, the contestants are too good. Yeah, it's hard to say whether the first place last time could make it to the final. Mr. Takubo Kim Soo Jung applied to withdraw from the competition because of physical discomfort. When did this happen? Just now. Then, bring the next contestant in advance. So next is... We have informed Mr. Kazama that he should come over soon. Then, advance the order of the following players in this way. butâ€¦ but? We went to Ms. Eiden's lounge but... No. 20: Kazama Jin (Japan) Um? What's happening? Yeah... why? This is the first time I have seen this arrangement of seats. Did Kazama Jin ask for it himself? Yes The floor in that place is uneven. When renovating last year, plywood was just pasted below. The sound quality from there will be affected. Kazama noticed this. Bartok's Piano Concerto No. 3 Sz.119 No. 20: Jin Kazama (16 years old, Japan) The sound is very good The world is making a sound Did you hear, Aya? Sound of the clock. Sound of the bird. Sound of the bird. Sound of the kettle. Sound of the kettle. Sound of the rain. Sound of the rain. How does the rain sound like? You found a good temperament from nature. Aya This world There is a variety of music echoing. Wow music is really awesome. Ok The world is making a sound. You made this world make a sound. Ok No. 44: Eiden Aya Anyway, take it down first No. 44: Eiden Aya What's wrong? Excuse me, sorry. Has Eiden not come yet? How to do? Bring ahead. Welcome back. Next, Ms. Eiden. Teacher I finally found it. Ms. Eiden It's time to play. No. 44: Aya Eiden (20 years old, Japan) Prokofiev Piano Concerto No.3 Op.26 I I think I understand now. What? What Mr. Hoffman's letter meant. It's up to all of us. Whether he's a gift or disaster? He's given us so many wonderful gifts, hasn't he?
