[jazz music] [waitress] Sir, would you like to order an appetizer? I'm expecting a friend. She'll be here any minute. If you need anything else, let me know. Thank you so much. [phone ringing] Where are you? Are you stuck in traffic? [Phoebe] Albert, I'm sorry, but I'm not coming. Well... I got us a bottle of Merlot, you said it was your favorite. [Phoebe] Look, you're very sweet, and I know the website says we're perfect for each other, but I just don't think it's a good match. Well, when we had coffee, I thought we had a really good time. [Phoebe] I don't want to have this conversation, and please don't write on my wall, I'm gonna block you. Bye. [ominous music] [muttering furiously] [Beck] Stupid bitch! [screaming] [rock music] [shouting] [cheering] [Sophie] All right! All right, nice pass, baby! - Hey. - Check this out. - I got accepted! - I'm not surprised. You had better grades than anybody, congratulations. Oh, thank you! How about you, did you hear back? What did they say? I haven't opened it yet. - Why not? - Because she's afraid to. I keep telling her just open it, and she won't do it. I was hoping you would do it. What? What does it say? [Kaitlyn] Dear Ms. Sophie Green. Thank you for your recent application to Whittendale College. Unfortunately, we regret to inform you... that you're going to spend the next four years of your life at the most awesome college with me as your roommate! [screaming] All right, let's eat, man, I'm starving. You're buying, you're buying. Guess I'm buying, I don't know. [lively music] [male singing] ♪ Oh, got to get to you, now ♪ Need you somehow, someway [cell phone beeps] Somebody's texting me. [Sophie] Be careful. It's that recruiter guy from USC. Give it to me. I'll read it. I got it. [Sophie] Ryan, you shouldn't be texting. [Ryan] They want to talk to me about a scholarship! Come on, you know I don't like when you do that. [screeching tires] [screaming] [nurse] It's gonna be all right, it's okay, it's okay. What kind of pain? Sharp like a knife? Or dull, like something is pressing down? Like... something is pressing down. On my left side... It's all tingly. [ominous music] [knocking] I'm working. We need you in ER. [Beck] Hey Sophie, I'm Dr. Beck. I need to take a look at your chest. Okay. Are you having trouble breathing? [Taylor] Heart tones are muffled, and we've got big changes on her EKG. [grunting] Okay, get me a cardiac workup and serial EKGs at 30, 60 and 90. Repeating troponins and a full CBC chem panel. I want a PT, PTTs, and INR. And be sure to give me a chest x-ray, okay? Sophie, I know it's tough for you to talk right now, so just nod your head yes or no, okay? At any time after the accident, did you pass out? You did, more than once? Have you ever had any heart trouble before? Okay, baby, one last question, and this is important. Do you like sushi? - Mm-hm. - Me too. When you're well, we'll have some sushi, okay? It's okay. [Taylor] She has a few broken ribs. Her forearm is fractured, and she sustained a whiplash. She's having some trouble breathing. It's better if she doesn't talk too much. Sophie, we're here, baby. How's... how's Ryan? [Taylor] Breathe easy, honey. He's going to recover. What happened? Were you guys drinking? He was texting again, wasn't he? - I knew it. - It was an accident. No, the first time, the fender bender, that was an accident. This time he nearly got my daughter killed. Jim, please, not now. [Beck] You must be Sophie's parents. I'm Dr. Beck, head of cardiology. Jim Green. This is my wife Adrienne. [Beck] Nice to meet you. May I speak to you over here? We'll be right back, honey. Well, she broke a couple ribs. We did a ct scan, and one of those ribs is cutting in to the left ventricle of her heart. Oh dear God. We have to operate immediately. Otherwise, she will die. [somber music] - Okay, hold up, come here. - I'm scared. [Adrienne] Your dad and I are gonna be right nearby. Hey, hey, this is a great hospital. I talked to the nurse, the doctor knows what he's doing, okay? Please, check on Ryan. Okay. You'll be fine, sweetheart. [ominous music] Hey, she's gonna be fine. Hey, fine. Okay. [Ryan's mother] Dad and I are on our way, we love you. I love you, too. Okay, I'll see you in a few hours, bye. - That your parents? - Yeah. They're flying in from a business trip in Seattle. How's Sophie? She just went into surgery. They're operating on her heart. Mr. Green, I am so sorry, I... Give me that. [Beck] Okay, pericardial sac is... sealed up. And we... are... looking good. [Taylor] Nice work. You ever done this before, doctor? [Beck] Eh, just a few hundred times. - Good job everybody. - All right, we got this. [heart monitor beeping] [blaring warning beeping] - Something's wrong. - Heart rate increasing to 130. Blood pressure dropping; have we got a rupture? - No, we don't. - Are you sure? [Beck] It's just an arterial spasm. [Taylor] Heart rate at 160 and climbing. Blood pressure's still going down! [Beck] It'll pass, hold on, just wait. [rapid beeping] Doctor, I think we should... [Beck] I said hold on! [beeping speeding up] Babe, come on, let's go. She's going to be fine. Oh, thank you. - When can we see her? - Well, we're going to move her to a private room, so... It shouldn't be long. Excuse me, I need to be somewhere. [melancholic music] [ominous music] Tell the parents they can come in now. How long until the anesthetic wears off? Well, in her case it'll be a while. She was heavily sedated, give her a few hours. She'll be her old self in the morning, just wait and see. Doc, I don't know what to say. [chortling] [Adrienne] I know if Sophie was awake right now I know that she'd want to give you a really big kiss. So, I'm gonna do it for her. Thank you. [ringing] It's okay, it's okay. Hey, kiddo. Hey, Dad. [Taylor] What's up, sleepy head? How're you feeling? Like a semi truck just rolled over my boobs. [Taylor] All right, well, I'm going to check your blood pressure. And you'll need to stay prone all day today, okay? Mm-hm. You scared the hell out of everybody. Where's Ryan? His parents picked him up about an hour ago. He has a broken leg, but he's gonna be just fine. Okay, Mom, I want to call him. - Where's my phone? - I'll get it. - He's not going to answer. - Why not? 'Cause I kind of threw his phone in the hazardous waste container thing. - You did what? - He's lucky I'm not pressing charges. [Sophie] Dad, I can't believe you! [Jim] Look, people are dying every day because idiots like your boyfriend don't have enough common sense to pull over to the side of the road. I'm sick of it. Okay, okay. [Sophie] Mom, did Ryan stop by while I was out? [Adrienne] No, honey. Are you sure, I could have sworn he that he kissed me. You must've been dreaming. [Kaitlyn] Oh my God, that is so cute! [slow rock music] [male singing] ♪ They're looking to find you ♪ You're out there somewhere - Oh, is it really 7:30? - Why, do you need to go? [Barbara] No, I've just been having so much fun this afternoon, I lost track of time. I'm really glad that you responded to my post. Me too. You know, if this works out between us, I've got this... [low key romantic music] Let me show you. Here's my place in the Cabo San Lucas. The master bedroom overlooks the Pacific Ocean. I'd love to take you there. [Barbara] That's beautiful. All that must have cost a fortune. [Beck] Well, I've worked all my life, and there's just me, so... I can afford it. Well, I've never been to Mexico. I've been to Japan. Barbara, part of the reason that I got on the website was so I could meet somebody exciting. Somebody like you. And just spoil her rotten. [Barbara] You don't hear that every day. I mean, you wouldn't have to work anymore. You could quit your job. Are you saying what I think you're saying? I've thought this through. I know what I want, and when I meet somebody I like, I know it. - But we just met. - I know. And that's the beauty of it, because I'm ready. I mean, I could retire right now, but... I want to share my life with someone. Well, I like my teaching job. [Beck] You wouldn't have time for a teaching job, not with kids. Kids. [Beck] That's a lot to lay on you on a first date, isn't it? But hey, little known fact: there are incredible international private schools in Baja, California. Great place to raise a family. You know what, I'm gonna go. Why? What? Did I say something wrong? [Barbara] Are you serious? Please don't go. Please don't go. Please. Before you run away, do me one favor. Just tell me what I'm doing wrong? Because I'm obviously doing something terribly wrong. Okay. We met four hours ago, we had coffee. We spent the afternoon together. But now you want me to bear your children and raise them in a foreign country? You're the doctor, not me, but I think you need to see a therapist. You're right. Thank you. Thank you for that enlightened analysis, you fat-ass bitch! I'll tell you what: I'll go to Bellevue and you can go straight to hell! I offer you a future, a life of paradise! And what do you do? You throw it back in my face! Who do you think you are? Get away from me. [Beck] Oh, I'll stay away from you. Women your age, you think you know everything, don't you? Touch me and I'll call the cops! I don't need to touch you! I don't need you! There's a girl at my work! She's young, she's beautiful, I take care of her... - Great. - She needs me! I take care of her! I saved her life and she has the common decency to appreciate what I've done for her! She listens to me! So go ahead, run, I don't care! Good luck getting a boyfriend, because I'm not interested! I am un-friending you! [Sophie] I do not understand guys. Why doesn't Ryan call me? He's been through a lot, honey. You'll see him soon enough. It's because of what dad did. [Adrienne] Would you rather your dad didn't care? [ominous music] I'm going to get some lunch at the cafeteria. I'll be right back. You want anything? No, thank you. Hi, Sophie. Hi, Dr. Beck. How are you feeling today? Better. Still sore, but mostly better. I'm going to change that bandage for you. Um, Nurse Taylor changed it this morning. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Well, I have some new ointment. It's a miracle ointment, to prevent scarring. So lift up your pajamas for me. I've got good news for you. The latest ct scan shows your heart is healing up just fine. I thought that would put a smile on your face. [Sophie] Oh, I'm sorry. I just... haven't heard from my boyfriend and I'm kinda worried about him. You know, boys that age, sometimes... Sometimes they just don't know what to say. You know? Yeah. Is this going to hurt? A little. How's that? That doesn't hurt at all. Nurse Taylor said I almost died on the operating table. Nurse Taylor talks too much. [Sophie] She also said you're the most amazing heart surgeon she's ever worked with. I'm going to have a scar, won't I? It'll heal. You'll barely notice it. [Sophie] You're just saying that. I'm gonna look hideous. I think you're beautiful. And if your boyfriend has a problem with a little mark around your heart... you need a new boyfriend. [Sophie] Thank you. For saving my life. Is everything all right? Oh, yeah. Her latest ct scan looks really good. She'll be able to go home today. Oh... good. Well, I'll give you ladies some privacy. [Sophie] Bye, Doctor Beck! Bye-bye. - What was he doing? - Just now? He was just changing my bandage. Was there a female nurse present when he was doing that? No, should there be? Yeah. [Sophie] Mom... it's fine; it's fine. [Taylor] No more hospital food for you. I'll need to see Sophie in a week for another EKG. You should be real proud of her, in a couple of weeks, she'll be right back to normal. Hey, I'll be better than normal. I've got a new heart, I'm gonna live forever. - There you go. - Thank you, doctor. Of course. I just love you, Dr. Beck. Bye. Bye bye. [Sophie] Bye, Nurse Taylor. Take care of yourself. Thank you. You want to do an echo next week? Isn't that a little soon? No, it's not. Set it up. [Sophie] You're the most amazing heart surgeon she's ever worked with. Thank you for saving my life. For saving my life. I just love you, Dr. Beck. [video game sounds] [knocking] Leave me alone. [knocking] Mom, could you stop bothering me, please? Hi. Hey. [Sophie] I emailed you. I called your parents' land line a dozen times. Why won't you talk to me? What am I supposed to say? Sorry? Of course I am. Look at you. It was an accident. That's not what your dad thinks. And he's right too, you know. I could have killed you. You must hate me. I don't. How could you not? I don't, okay? I don't. You always gotta blame somebody, that's such a guy thing. We're gonna get through this. You, and me, okay? How's your leg? Oh, my leg. My leg's perfect, except for they told me I'm never gonna run full speed again. I'm so sorry, I didn't know. [Ryan] Can you please just go? [melancholic music] [video game noises] I mean, you think you know someone. We've been together for three years. It was like I was talking to a total stranger. Look at it from his perspective: Soccer was his whole life, and now he can't do that anymore. Give him some time. Besides, I never met any man that could talk about his feelings. [doorbell ringing] [ominous music] Sophie. I'm sorry, I know it's late, I just really needed to talk to you. I know that I should have called first. No, really, it's okay, please, come in. Wow, you have a really nice house. [Beck] Thank you. I've just been really confused the past few weeks. Well, that would be normal. You've been through a lot. I know this sounds crazy, but... I can't stop thinking about you. I feel the same way. You do? We were meant to be together. My parents think I'm asleep in my room. I snuck out. I won't tell. If you have any more heart palpitations you let me know, okay? Have a good day. Doctor, Sophie's ready, she's in room three. [Sophie] I got you something. Oh. Oh my goodness, that is adorable. I wrote you a note too, but don't read it right now. Why can't I read it right now? Because it's, you know. No, please don't read it. Okay, I'll wait until I get home tonight. Okay. Thank you. So where are you going to college? Whittendale. She just got accepted. Impressive. What're you gonna study? Physiology. You know, pre-med. So, you want to be a doctor? Yeah, I think so. Well, if you have any questions about what it's like to be a doctor, surrounded by sick people, just ask me. I can tell you everything you don't want to know. That sounds awesome. Well, uh, we'll see you at her next appointment? Bye. He is so cool. What's the matter? I don't know. It's just... You know, sometimes I get the feeling he's, like, hitting on you or something. What? He's older than dad! It doesn't matter. God, honey, you're so naive. Look, the next time you see him, just... don't dress like this. Like this? Oh, because a broken arm is a real turn-on, mom. I'm naive, hello. "Dear Doctor Beck, Up until this moment, I had no idea how precious and fragile life can be. You have given me the most wonderful gift of all. Thanks to you and your staff, I am alive. With no pun intended, my heart truly belongs to you. Love, Sophie." Sophie. [rock music] [Kaitlyn] Bye! Oh my God, I am so hungry. Oh, me too. [Kaitlyn] So did your teachers give you a ton of makeup assignments or did they just let you slide? They let me slide. You liar, they definitely did not just let you slide. God, you should see all the homework I gotta do! [Kaitlyn] Hey, isn't that your doctor? Oh. Hey, Dr. Beck! Over here! Hi, Sophie. And, um, Kaitlyn, right? Yeah, you guys live around here? No, we're just addicted to the carrot cake at this place. [Sophie] It's so nice to have real food again. [Beck] I know, I practically live in the hospital cafeteria and I swear they're trying to kill me. Do you guys mind if I join you? Go ahead. [Beck] Our emergency room gets so many car accidents caused by texting, we've lost count. It's worse than drunk driving. [Kaitlyn] I'm gonna go get some of that carrot cake. You guys want some? Are you kidding, yes. Here, wait, wait, wait, here we go. Wow. I'll be right back. [low key music] Thanks again for the bear. And the note. You're welcome. [Beck] It meant a lot to me. [ominous music] So, are you and Kaitlyn going to eat after you get through here? She has to work really early, so we'll probably just head home. [Beck] Well, if you're free I was gonna take in a movie, and I was wondering if you'd like to come with me? I mean, just you, not Kaitlyn. Oh. I can't. I have homework that I have to make up. But thanks. No problem. [Kaitlyn] Thank you, Dr. Beck. Here's your change. Keep it. And you can also have my cake. I think I'm gonna catch an early show. It was good seeing you both, really. All right, bye. That was weird. Yeah, no kidding. Little bitch. Bitch. [rattling] [yelling] I am a doctor! I am a doctor! I am a doctor! I'm a doctor. [sobbing] [Jim] I think you guys are over-reacting. [Sophie] Dad, he was looking at me like he had a crush on me. Mom, you were right. We should get a new doctor. Do either of you guys realize who we're dealing with? He is the chairman of the president's Task Force on Heart Disease. He practically rewrote the book on cardiovascular surgery. Sophie is gonna need a cardiologist to look after her for the rest of her life, and getting a doctor as good as Albert Beck, we'd have to fly Sophie to New York. Look. I love you. More than anything. And I don't want to settle, I want the very best doctor on the West Coast looking after my baby girl, and lucky for us, he's it. [Adrienne] So the next time she's in his office for a follow-up exam and he totally hits on her, what is she supposed to do? [Jim] Sophie is a very beautiful young woman, guys will be guys. Occasionally, those guys are going to cross the line. It sucks, the world's awful. She is just going to have to get used to it. [Adrienne] I understand that, but what I don't understand is why women are expected to tolerate it, and men get a free pass. "Oh, they're men, they can't help themselves." - I'm not saying that... - You're saying exactly that! No, I'm not saying that! Yes, you are! Okay! Fine. I'll talk to him. Thank you. [Jim] So, Sophie said you asked her to go to the movies with you. What? Oh, right, no. What happened was, I told her I was gonna go see that new German film, and I heard it was really good. That's not what she told me. [Beck] Jim, I'm a doctor. I can't socialize with my patients. If I do, I could lose my license. And by the way, you should know that what she's doing right now is extremely common. - How so? - It's natural for patients to idolize their doctors. We save their lives, we are their heroes, and they make up fantastic scenarios about us, fantasies... No, no, Sophie... doesn't really do that kind of thing. Jim, let me show you something. She gave me this. Harmless enough. But, then she gave me this. I can't tell you how many times I've seen this kind of behavior. My colleagues have seen it. I know it's her word against mine, but I'm hoping you'll believe me. [Jim] Adrienne thinks we should go to another cardiologist. [Beck] That is not a good idea. It's not likely, but if her hearts grows in size, I will have to go back in there; Jim... I'm the best surgeon money can buy, you need me. [Adrienne] She's fantasizing about all this? Apparently patients do this all the time. I'm not buying it. [Jim] And she may need surgery again. - What? Why? - There's a slim chance. They don't know yet. But if it does happen, we don't want a new cardiologist at that point. We want someone who understands what's going on with her heart. Don't you agree? All right, we'll stay with him for now. But Jim, if he does anything inappropriate, I swear... [Jim] We'll switch. I promise. Okay. [Sophie] So, Whittendale is having a student orientation on the fifth. [Adrienne] Great, are parents invited? [Sophie] Yeah, but... I was kind of wanting to go by myself. Oh, really? No, of course I want you to go with me! Okay, so we'll talk in the car. I'm so glad you came over. The way you take care of me makes me feel so safe. [moaning] [doorbell] They're home! [knocking] Who's that at this hour? I don't know. Hi. Hi... Can I talk to you? Are you going to be nice this time? Oh no. [Sophie] Oh my God, my room's a mess. [Ryan] You look good. [Sophie] Thanks, you too. Thanks. Do you want to sit down? [Ryan] Yeah. I have a confession. While you were in surgery, they were working on my leg. And for, like, five hours I kept bugging the nurses, making them go check if you were okay. I was thinking I was going to lose you. And I don't really, you know, talk to God on a regular basis, but while you were in there I was striking up one hell of a conversation with the man upstairs. Well, what did she say? Well, I told her that I'd give up everything just to know that you'd be okay. And I've been acting real stupid lately. Yes, you have. And I'm about to get more stupid. It was my grandmother's. [Sophie] What does this mean? It can mean whatever you want it to mean. It's like, if I accept this, you're gonna think that life is all fixed. And if I don't, then just... Look, you've got to find the strength in yourself... Okay, Oprah, yeah... forget about that. I just love you and I want to hang out with you. Can I say something like that without you freaking out? Yes. Okay, then. [grunting] Yup, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - It's okay. - I'm sorry. Mom, look what Ryan got me! [Ryan] I thought you didn't even want it! - Excuse me. - Yes? Can you tell me when Ryan Chambers has his next appointment with Dr. Zamora, please? Sure. Thanks. - How've you been? - Good. Do you want to help me out with this pocket here? - Yeah. - I've been good. - How've you been? - Good. Just keeping you guys up and running. All right, she'll be in in a minute. Okay, thank you very much. No problem. [Beck] Hello, Ryan! How are ya doing? Remember me? [Ryan] Yeah, you're the guy who asked my girlfriend to the movies. Well, that's not why I'm here, I just thought I'd check on you. See how the leg's doing. How is that leg? [Dr. Zamora] Dr. Beck, hi. Did you need something? Oh, just came by to say hi to this young man. I was here the night of his accident, so I just thought I would come in, see how he was doing. [Dr. Zamora] Oh, that's nice. All right, how are you? How's your leg? [Ryan] You know, it's getting better. Well, let's check your knee out, and show me what you're doing. [Ryan] Okay. That's about where it stops, right there. Okay, try to get a little more. [cell phone ring] What's wrong? Read this. That's good, okay, I want you to ice... Excuse me, did I leave my...? - Oh, there it is. - Oh, no problem. All right, I want you to ice your knee after you do all your exercises. Hope you feel better. [Dr. Zamora] Try to bear a little bit more weight. [Ryan] Okay, thank you very much. - Bride of Frankenstein? - I did not send that text. Eddie showed me the text, and it was from you. Okay, some douchebag at school hacked my phone. You know what, I bet it was that Kevin Mathews kid. He's in my chemistry class and he hates me, I bet... Do I gross you out? I gross you out, don't I? No, no. Look at me. Look at it. I knew it. You should see your face right now. I just... I feel bad, because I know that I caused that... No, you feel bad because you think I'm ugly and you don't want to admit it. You understand that you sound crazy right now? - Oh, I'm acting crazy? - Yeah. You know what, maybe we should cool it for a little while. I don't want you to go out with me because you feel sorry for me. Look, I did not send that text. Okay? So come here. What is this? - Mercy sex? - Oh my God. [melancholic music] [Eddie] All right, all right, so check it out. So I got like this... see, you ain't even paying attention. I don't know, bro, I'll check you later, all right? Peace. [buzzing] Hey. [Ryan] Hey, I need a favor. Okay, look, I know you're pissed at me, but Kaitlyn made me show Sophie that text. [Ryan] I'm not mad at you. I just need to know the exact time you received it. Can you check your phone? Yeah, yeah. [ominous music] Oh, Ryan. Dr. Beck. What are you doing here? How did you get my address? [Ryan] Internet, it was easy. So, what are you trying to do? You trying to make Sophie hate me? What? You sent the text. While I was in the exam room with Dr. Zamora. While you were in the what? [Ryan] Well, congratulations; you know what? It worked; she broke up with me. I'm sorry, son, I do not know what you're talking about. Why'd you do it, huh? You in love with her? Or do you just want to get in her pants? [Beck] Wow, Ryan. Wow. Did it ever occur to you that your girlfriend probably broke up with you because... you almost killed her? Oh, whoa, kid, come on! Not cool! Stop it! - Not cool? - This is not smart. Gotta stop this right now before you get yourself into real trouble. Are you all right? Did you hurt yourself? How's this feel? [yelling] Yeah, you should have that looked at. You son of a bitch... [Beck] You know what this is called? Assault with a deadly weapon. On my property, too. Yeah, you want me to call the cops? - No. - Are you sure? I can. [Ryan] No, please, Dr. Beck, please. I'm sorry. [Beck] Just for the record. I didn't send any text. Can you help me up? Yeah, right. [Ryan] You can't just leave me here, you're a doctor! [Beck] Yes, I can. I'm off the clock. Dr. Beck. [door slamming] [cell phone ringing] What the. [Kaitlyn] He just got through torturing me. He's in love with you. What is he talking about? I don't know. [Beck] Hi, Sophie. Can I talk to you? What are you doing here? Are you following me? No. I was doing some shopping, and I saw you walk in. Do you have a minute? No, actually, I don't. Please? Ryan said that you tortured him. He's upset at me for some reason. He came by my house. He swung his cane at me in my front yard. - Tried to kill me. - Are you serious? [Beck] He fell, and when I checked on him, he experienced a lot of pain. True story. Look, Sophie, I realize your ex-boyfriend is going through a tough time, so I'm not going to report him to the police. But if he does anything like this ever again, I'm going to have to. I know I made you feel uncomfortable earlier, and I wanted to apologize. Whoa. How did you know I liked this kind of doll? [Beck] I didn't. I just saw it and I thought you'd like it. I'm pretty intuitive about this kind of thing. I can't accept this. Hey, we're going to be late, so we should go. Bye. [angry grunting] Nobody cares! Nobody cares! [sobbing] [Adrienne] Did you tell Dr. Beck that Sophie collects dolls? No, why would I do that? [Sophie] Because I never told him. The only way he would know is if he's looking in my bedroom window in the middle of the night! Dad, you should see the way he looks at me. It's like he's a middle schooler and he wants me to help him lose his virginity. [Jim] Okay, what do you want me to do; Report him to the AMA? Yeah, and I think we should get a restraining order. [Jim] And ruin this guy's career? He is following her in the mall. What are we gonna wait until he rapes her? [Sophie] I don't want him to be my doctor anymore, dad. I refuse to let that man touch me again! [Jim] Okay, okay, I'm sorry, honey. I'll talk to him tomorrow and find out what's going on. No, no more discussion. We are getting her a new doctor and that's it. Hi, Phyllis, I'm here to pick up the CD-ROM of Sophie's ct scans. Yes, um, Dr. Beck would like to speak with you first. If you could take a seat he'll be right with you... [Adrienne] I'd just like the CD, please. And you needed Sophie's signature, right? [Beck] Hi, Adrienne. Why don't you come back to my office and we'll talk about this. There's nothing to discuss. Can I have that? Hold on. Hi, Sophie. Please; I don't think you understand the seriousness of her condition. [Adrienne] Oh, I understand just fine. Is Jim okay with this? I don't want you as her doctor. I don't want you talking to her. I don't want you giving her any gifts. I don't want you coincidentally bumping into her at the mall. Thank you for operating on her heart, but you need to stay away from her. Now give me that! Son of a bitch! Okay. Adrienne Green. There we go. Hm. Pre-Menopausal. All right. Allergic reaction to penicillin. Perfect. I'm sorry. My mother made me come to the hospital with her. I didn't want to have anything to do with it. It was all her idea... [Beck] No need to apologize. I know how mothers are. [Sophie] I can't wait to be away from her. Don't worry, you'll be free soon enough. By the way, you look beautiful. Mom? Mom, are you in the bathroom? Oh my God. What happened? Mom, what happened?! Mom! [dramatic music] It's okay, I'm right here, it's gonna be okay. [phone ringing] [male operator] 911, what's your emergency? I need an ambulance; my mom is on the floor and she's barely breathing. [male operator] Did she ingest anything poisonous? - I don't know. - An ambulance is on the way. Okay, when will it be here? - Ten to fifteen minutes. - I can't wait for that long! I'm gonna drive her to the hospital myself. All right, mom, put your arms around my neck, okay, now lift! Come on! Come on! [wheezing] Guess who's in ER? Florence Nightingale. Close. Sophie Green, with her mom. How are you doing, Mark? Hey, what's going on with Mrs. Green, there? Not sure. Some kind of allergic reaction. She went into anaphylactic shock and total vascular collapse. [Beck] Wow, brain damage? [Wilson] Nah, we got an amp of epi and steroids on board. She seems to be stabilizing. - I think she'll be okay. - Okay. Lucky her daughter found her when she did, otherwise we'd be having a different conversation. Ah, good for her. I'll talk to you. [Beck] Lucky girl. [Wilson] So I'm gonna take you to your mom. She's resting, she's doing much better. You did a great job, you got her here just in time, so. Everything's okay, all right? Sophie, congratulations. The doctor told me you saved your mother's life. Your first patient. You're going to do really well in medical school. I need to get back to my mom. [Beck] I won't keep you. - Hey! - How'd it go? Good, I've already met a bunch of cool teachers. [Adrienne] Oh, honey, that's great. I'm sorry I couldn't go with you. [Sophie] It's not like you don't have a valid excuse. She's not sorry. She's got me waiting on her, hand and foot. [Adrienne] I can't believe you're going away to college. Hey, you guys? [Adrienne] Yeah? I just want to thank you for making this possible for me. [Adrienne] You earned it. - We love you. - Love you, honey. [Sophie] Love you too, bye. [grunting] Oh, baby, come on, come on. Come on! Come on! [engine starting] [engine starting] [crashing, glass breaking] [engine cranking] [glass breaking] [cell phone ringing] [Sophie] Hi, this is Sophie. You've reached my voice mail, so please leave a message. Hi, honey, it's me. I've left you three messages and it's getting really late and you haven't called me back, so... call me. [doorbell ringing] That better not be her boyfriend. Can I help you? [female reporter] Tragic news tonight, a young woman is dead after crashing her vehicle into a lamp post where it burst into flames here at the corner of Elsinore Drive and 22nd street. Firefighters found the young woman's body, burned beyond recognition, but they were able to trace the car back to her family, and have now identified her as 18-year-old Sophie Green of Los Angeles. Ms. Green was a senior and an honor student at Lexington High School. Investigators have not determined if alcohol or drug use was a factor in the crash. Other women, they don't listen to me, but you do. You trust me. You do what I say, not because it's what I want but because you know in your heart that I'm right. I give you... life. Why? Love. My love. Fierce, and forever, and only for you. [crying] You probably think I'm going to force myself on you, don't you? I'm not. I want it to be something that you want to do. But we can't stay here. Won't be long before somebody comes looking for us. But don't you worry. I have been ready to retire for some time now. I've got some things I need to take care of. And then after a few days, I'm gonna take you to a wonderful new place. Look what I got you. Nice, huh? I'll drive, and you'll sleep the whole way. It's near the ocean. It'll be so beautiful. And then no one will bother us. [shrieking] Scream all you want. Nobody can hear you. Shh. It's okay. [whimpering] [screaming] Baby, look at me. Calm down, calm down, calm down. [dramatic music] Nope, you won't do, fella. Sorry. Oh baby, not today. Bingo. Everything's going to be fine. [crashing] Absolutely fine. What're you doing, moving out? Just cleaning up. See you tomorrow. [melancholic music] [Adrienne] I know she'd want you to have that. I need to... The funeral is on Saturday. And there's gonna be a lot of guests. So I'm thinking I should cook. This isn't my grandma's ring. - What? - I know what it looked like. And this isn't the ring that I gave to Sophie. The hospital must've made a mistake? Yeah. [female #2] This should have been given to the parents the night they came in to identify the body. This belongs to somebody else. It didn't belong to my girlfriend. Apparently it was removed from her body when she came into the morgue. Look, I know the ring that I gave to her, this is not it. I'm sorry. I don't know what to tell you. [ominous music] [female reporter] Firefighters found the young woman's body, burned beyond recognition, Excuse me. How do I get a copy of the coroner's report? They won't give it to me, but they will give it to family. I need you to come meet me at the medical examiner's office. [Adrienne] I'm sorry, Ryan, I'm not going down there. Look, they probably just made a clerical error. [Ryan] And what if they didn't? What if that body wasn't Sophie? Mrs. Green, please. We need to get to the bottom of this. [Jim] This is crazy. [Adrienne] Would you just look at this? I was just as skeptical as you, but Ryan has a point, here. The coroner logged in at 12:55 and then Dr. Beck logged in a half hour later. [Jim] So? Who cares? [Ryan] So, why would a cardiologist be logging in to a coroner's report at 1:25 A.M.? Did you ask the guy at the lab? Yeah, he didn't know. Well, maybe he wanted Dr. Beck to double-check something? Mr. Green, if anyone could fake someone's death, it's gonna be a doctor... Ryan, enough with the conspiracy theories! My God, the funeral is tomorrow, and you're... I can't do this. I can't understand why my baby girl isn't with us anymore. I can't... I can't think straight. I can't function at my job, I can't... I know, I know... No, you don't know, because you're encouraging this! Look, son, all you're doing is making it harder for us to get past this. She's not coming back. Listen, I know where Dr. Beck lives, and I'm going over there. Ryan, don't. - He's probably right. - And what if I'm right? I mean, she's burned so badly that no one can recognize her? The ring? Now this? Come with me. [Beck] We're gonna get you all cleaned up here, baby. Yeah. It's gonna be nice. Let me pull this down for you. There you go. Doesn't that feel better? We should have called. I didn't want to tip him off. I got to see inside that house. [dramatic music] I'm sorry, darling, gotta do it, gotta do it, gotta do it, relax, relax, relax. - What is this? - We need to talk to you. Yeah, can we come in? No, what are you doing here? Where's Sophie? - What? - You faked her death. She's somewhere in here, isn't she? Is he serious? Excuse me. Ryan. Sophie, say something! Ryan, what are you doing? Sophie, Sophie! Sophie... Sophie, are you in here? Sophie! [Beck] Are you satisfied? Why don't you want to check in the garage while you're at it? Okay, this was a huge mistake. We're really sorry, Dr. Beck. [Beck] Look, son, I know you're upset, but you have no right to barge into my house like that. [Adrienne] We're leaving. This was a big misunderstanding. [Beck] Oh, a misunderstanding. Is that what you call it? Adrienne, what the hell's the matter with you? [Adrienne] What's the matter with me? My daughter is dead! And you know, forgive me if I'm acting just a little irrational. Have you ever lost a child, Dr. Beck? Have you? No. But I've lost patients I've cared about very much. Sophie was one of them. Dr. Beck, I'm really sorry. I'm sorry for you too, darling. [Adrienne] Ryan, let's go. [thumping] Let me out! Let me out! [thumping] Calm down! Good grief! No, no, no, no, no. [dramatic music] Got a long drive today. You need to eat. Oh, that's a relief, huh? And a little mashed potatoes. Help it go down a little better. There we go. Don't worry, I'm not going to poison you. You need to eat. Delicious. Thank you. Well, the least I can do is feed you properly. I'm not talking about the food. What? I'm thanking you for being so good to me. The way you touched me last night. I liked it. [Beck] You did? Really? I don't believe you. I'm ready, now. You've changed your mind all of a sudden. Why? I've done it, but, I've never had a real... You know. I want to know what that feels like. You're an expert on the human body. You know what to do, don't you? Well I did take a full semester of gynecological studies, so I am quite... skilled. Untie me? I know what you're trying to do. [Sophie] I'm not trying to do anything... - Yes you are! - No, I'm not! I just want to touch you. Just my hands. Please. How's your wrist, is it sore? I'm so sorry. Let me grab your other one. Why would you do that? I love you! You don't love me! You don't know anything about it! [Beck] The way you kissed me! I know you care about me! I hate you! You hate me? You hate me? You hate me? You hate me? You hate me? I just want someone to be with me! I just want someone to be with me. [sobbing] Is that too much to ask? I mean, why can't I get the girl? [Sophie] Because you're insane! No woman is ever going to love you! Why would you say that? Why would you say that? After everything I've done for you? I gave you your life! I gave you your life. And I can just as easily take it away. [Sophie] Then do it. Kill me. Let me tell you something. I can reach in that chest of yours and make that heart do anything I want it to! You want to stab me? You want to stab me? I'll take your arms. You want to run from me? I'll take your legs. You want to scream at me ever again? I'll take your voice. And then, Sophie Green, you will need me to take care for you for the rest of your life. You say nobody wants me? Well who's gonna want a armless, legless mute like you? Get ready for surgery. Allow me to take care of you. Please! [groaning in pain] Sophie, I love you! Let me take care of you, let me take... I love you. [melancholic music] [chatter] [distant speaking] [Kaitlyn] I don't understand this. I believe in a higher spiritual power. And most of the time I think that this life makes sense. But today... I'm not so sure. I can't imagine the world without Sophie. And I can't believe I'm never gonna see her... [gasping] [dramatic music] He's not here. [Latin music] [speaking in Spanish] She'll be here any minute. [transcendent music] [jazz music]
