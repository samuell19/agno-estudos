Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. (pen scratching) - [Henry] It's not funny to me. - [Tyra] It's not funny? See, he always counters what I have to say. That's the problem. - Listen, she thinks everything's a big joke, because all she wants to do is take my money. - How does it make me feel that he put a baby inside me and that he walks off, and then he talks about how I'm a lowlife, but he can't give me any money to do anything with his son. - First of all, I don't walk off, all right? - I really can't stand him. Try to keep your mouth quiet for a minute. - Can you talk to her? 'Cause I damn sure don't wanna hear you. - Henry! He's either happy, one extreme, or he's pissed. I should've never named - Do you see what I'm sayin'? - my son after him. - She's fuckin' crazy. - Poor excuse for a man. - You would've left, okay? - I have little anger issue. - She got a big anger issue. - Shu-ju-ju-ju. - Yeah, look at you. - See? You just wanna hear yourself talk all the time. - Let me hear you talk. - I damn sure don't wanna hear you talk. I don't have to do this. Right. - You can take the man out the ghetto, you can't take the ghetto out the man. Projects. - You already know I been sayin' that to her ass, all right? - Anger issues. - Yes, I got anger issues! - That's-- - You takin' my fuckin' money. It's hard-earned money. - There's no fine line with this man. I just got a job. - What the hell am I doin' here? - You run your mouth so much. Let me tell you, let me talk to her. - She just got a job. McDonald's is far from a motherfuckin' job. - See. I told you this wouldn't help. You always have to be right. About everything. Make sense out of everything. Everything is not supposed to make sense. That was something my grandma Pam used to say. Everything is not supposed to make sense. My grandma was a wise woman. She lived to be 92 before we laid her to rest. She was smiling and kind. She told me to remember one thing. A man will treat you exactly the way you allow him to. And that the road to self-respect was not an easy one, and that you may not like what you find along the way. * Another day * I'm feelin' stuck * Don't wanna move, baby * I just wanna lose ya * I'm bound to lose * But I don't want the new stuff * * Confused, I always choose us * Call me crazy 'cause it's true * * I can't tell if I'm still in love with you * * 'Cause my thoughts are far away * * You know my mind is goin', babe * * Comfort is a killer * But I'd rather be complacent * I don't wanna move * 'Cause it might be a mistake * If I go, if I stay (phone ringing) * Round and round we go I know * Our love's a circle we never seem to know * - Hello. - Henry. I need to talk to you. - What? I'm busy. - Yeah, yeah, okay. I'm on my way to work, but can I ask you for a quick favor? - Tyra, come on. I'm workin' out, what do you need? - I need about $100. - Listen, I told you not to put him in them expensive-ass schools, didn't I? - Yeah, it's not that much money. - Listen, I went to public schools. That's all I needed, right? - What do you want? I don't want him hangin' out on the streetcorner. He has to have a good education. - Call me back later. - Hello? Hello. (phone ringing) - [Henry] What? - Henry, don't hang up the phone on me. I wanna finish this conversation. - [Henry] Why, again, are you asking me for money? - Why am I asking you for money? Because it's your son. - [Henry] And I turned out fine. - Yeah, look how you turned out. Mm-hm. If I didn't hide that gun, you woulda got three more years in prison. - Tyra, that's a low blow. Now, you know I changed my life. - Well, change your son's life. Why don't you give him a chance to make something of his life? Maybe with this head start, he can go to Ivy League school. You know, get some opportunities, see what the world has to offer. Or what, you want him to grab a beer and hang out with you and your boys on the corner? - I resent you for sayin' that. You know nine outta 10 businesses fail? - Yeah? Well, failure is a chance to learn, not an excuse to quit, Henry. - You know, you so damn dramatic. You know, you missed your callin'. You coulda had three Oscars by now. - Mm-hm. And you coulda got three more years in the pen if I didn't hide that gun for you. You owe me. I mean, all I'm askin' for is $100 for your son's school trip. - No, I'm not gonna give you $100! Listen, when I was in school, field trips cost $10. - Henry, it's for your son's science trip. They gotta ride in a bus for two hours. - Look, why don't you just get the money from your new man? - Yeah. Well, that man? He bought sneakers for your son, and I felt terrible, but he needed them. So how does that make you feel, another man buyin' sneakers for your son, huh? You should feel like a piece of shit. - You know what? If you have any of them dumbass morons around my motherfuckin' son! You know what you are? A lowdown, vindictive-ass bitch. That's what you are! - I'm the mother of your child, you fuckin' loser. How could you talk to me like that? - Answer the phone. Shit. - I'm done talkin' to you, Henry. Don't call me back anymore. I'm on my way to work. - Listen, don't hang up. Look, I know we don't get along. And we haven't gotten along in a long time. But for the sake of our son, please. I'm gonna have dinner with Kara at 6:00 at Garino's. - Well, hooray for you. - Come at 5:15, 5:30. Please, just be on time. I will give you the money. Don't be late, I don't want you to run into her, because the last time that you came up there, you almost wired her jaw shut. - Well, I don't give a shit about that buck-tooth ho. I just care about my child. - All right, for me. Just be on time? - Okay. Okay. Look, I'll be there. - All right, thank you. Damn. - Please, breathe in. Inhale deeply. Let your head touch the sky. Hold it. And exhale. Into your meditation stance and hold. - Girl, I don't know why you're always doin' for dude. He got you pregnant and left you, and now he gives you money whenever he feels like it. - Geez, you make it seem like it's some kind of science experiment. Impregnation sequence begin. - You was. Seriously. Listen, you need to get a backbone. Ty, you need to toughen up. My motto is if he ain't puttin' food in my mouth, he goin' to the courthouse. - No, he's trying. Besides, I don't wanna alienate him. He's a good dad. And Little Henry, he worships the ground he walks on. - Well, sounds like he's not the only one worshiping the ground. - Excuse me? - Does my friend have a case of the starry eyes herself? - Girl, no! - Shh! - Girl, I do not want him. Mm-mm. I moved on to better and way bigger things. - Yeah, well, it sounds like you gonna have a second better and bigger science experiment coming soon. - Uh-uh. Don't wish that on me. I am Strapped-Up Sally. - Ah, well, you actin' like Knocked-Up Nancy. (laughs) - You just hatin' 'cause you not gettin' none. - Uh-uh. Celibacy is my choice, honey, okay? I chose that. These men are drivin' me crazy, so I put them on an official timeout. - Timeout? Girl, timeout? Your timeout has been like six months. You're on official coochie hibernation vagina vacation. - Hibernation? Girl, this is a Duracell stimulation. - Shh! - And speaking of Mr. Bigger Things, where's he at, on the road? - Yeah, I told you he's a pharmaceutical rep, so he's always on the road. - Oh God, pharmaceutical rep. Okay, so he's a pharmaceutical rep, out on the road makin' tons of money, but me and him both drive a Honda. I work at 7-Eleven, and we drive the same car. - Stop, stop, leave him alone! You are just hatin'. It's fine. Look, I gotta get ready and go to work. - Okay, I'll see you tonight. You and Little Henry better be over for the Real Housewives marathon, then the reunion show. - Oh, I gotta take a raincheck, because I gotta go to the restaurant to get the money from Henry. (sighs) - You goin' to see Henry? Tyra. Tyra. - What? - I forbid you to see him. I don't wanna be with you for four hours while you cryin'. You look like Shabba Ranks when you cry. Have you ever seen yourself? (laughs) I'm not jokin'. You are emotionally scarring. Don't go. I forbid you. - Don't worry. I'm-a be outta the restaurant before she even gets there. - Okay. But girl, you need me to come with you? I got Vaseline, razor blades, whatever I need, and a rolled-up newspaper. You know how I get down. - Girl, no, no, no. I am not worried. I told you, I'm-a leave, get the money from big Henry, and I'm gone. - Mm, mm, mm. Okay. Well, you know the code to text me if you need backup. 'Cause you know I'm about that action. - I know you are. I know. Bye, Lindsay, I love you. - You leavin'? - I'm leavin' yoga. - That's cool, because when I'm in Miami, turnin' necks, snappin' heads, then you gonna be lookin' like that. - All right, lemme finish this class. - Yes. - No, I gotta go. I'll see you. - Oh, that's what you think? That's what you think? Lookin' very flabby. I'm supposed to be Serena and you Nicki Minaj, girl. Real booties matter. Oh, I'm-a leave too. (phone ringing) - You can answer that if you need to. - Oh no, that's okay, Mr. Owens. It's just Henry. He's called me six times already. Geez. - Well, I understand. - What do you mean you understand? - A fine woman like you, working late with a rich man like me. I'd be worried too. - Oh really? - Brother's just feeling the heat. - Oh, he's not the jealous type. - Why not? Or has he got somethin' else goin' on to distract him? - Um, the Jones case. We were discussing the Jones case, right? - Yeah, the Jones case. We'll need sworn testimony over to the judge by morning along with that brief. - [Man] Yeah, yeah, then I'll follow up with her. - Mm. - Hi. - Good evening, welcome. - Good evening. Can I have a table for two, please? Preferably in the back. - Oh, hot date. - Excuse me? - I mean, I just assumed, since you wanted to sit in the back, that, you know, maybe you had a little hanky-panky for dessert. (laughs) - That's a little bit inappropriate. Could you just see me to my table? - Look, relax. I don't mind watching. You know, back at my apartment I got binoculars. I like to watch all the time. And you never know, I just might jump off the sidelines and join the game. - Are you crazy? (laughs) - Put me in, coach. - Yeah, you crazy. - You ain't seen crazy yet. - Dr. Garcia'll be with you in a second. - Great. Lookin' forward to doin' business with her again. - Yeah, right. (phone ringing) - Yeah, gettin' out but can you hold on a second? - Okay. Well, I was just tryin' to see what time we're going. - I'm gonna have to call you back. I'll call you back. Yeah, yeah, I'll talk to you later. Definitely, definitely, definitely. - May I help you? - Yeah, I'm here to see Henry Fairway. - Oh, you mean that sexy chocolate drop at table 24. - Excuse me? - Girl, let me know if you need help with that. I got you. - Excuse me? - You know they say bad things come in threes? Very, very bad things. - Okay, this is gettin' awkward. Just please take me to his table. - All right, this way. - Your water. - Thank you. - No problem. - [Tyra] Goodness, I didn't come here to be sexually assaulted. - I was a victim too. - What kind of seedy place is this? You know what? I'm not surprised, considerin' you picked this spot. - You go with the jabs, honey. - Come on, let's just get this over with, 'cause I don't even wanna start with you. - Okay, let's get it over with, 'cause Kara will be here soon. - Well, please, okay, well, let's hurry up then. - What is your problem? Look, Kara's gonna be in my life, so you need to just learn to get along with her. - I don't need to learn to get along with her. I don't need to learn nothing. She needs to learn how to control her mouth and keep her damn hands off her iPhone. Or do I need to remind her, Henry-- - Why are so-- - Because I'm-- - Why the hell do you have to be so ghetto? - Please, I am not ghetto. I'm from Burbank. I learned all this foolishness from you and WorldStar. - You said $100, right? - That's right. - And what's up with you and all these over-the-top field trips? - Over the top? - [Henry] Yes. - You know what's over the top is you goin' to strip clubs and sports-betting places. You know what? What's wrong with being over the top for your son? - Oh God, here it comes. - You know what? I shoulda kept my legs closed for you. Shoulda used them same damn legs to run away from you. - What is your problem? Huh? What's wrong with you? Everything's an insult. You can't just sit down, have a nice meal, have a great conversation, can you? No, you can't. - You know what? Just gimme the money so I can get the fuck outta here. - Yes, please get the fuck outta here. (phone ringing) - Henry. - You on your way? - No, no, I'm sorry. This project is taking forever. - Listen, I don't understand. Why you not over here? Why are you still there? - Henry, I told you about asking questions when it comes to my work. - I'm sorry, baby. All right. - Oh, right there. - What? Kara, what are you doin'? - Um, no, nothing. Sir, the files can go right there. Listen, you go ahead and eat without me. I can't talk right now. I'll talk to you tomorrow. I'll be home in the morning. - What do you mean, in the morning? Kara. Kara! (sighs) - He's so clingy sometimes. I can't take it. - That's why you need a grown-ass man in your life. I wouldn't ask you no questions. - Is that so? - Yeah, I don't play no games, baby. - Interesting. (sighs) - Well, you might as well stay. Have a drink. She's not coming. - Mm-mm. I'm not a consolation prize. Just gimme my money so I can get back on the bus. - I cannot believe she's not comin'. - Well, what did she say? - Can I get you anything, sir, ma'am? - Yeah, uh, Jack and Coke for me, and get her a vodka cranberry. - [Tyra] I'll have the chardonnay. - [Waitress] Okay, right away. - She says she has work to do. - Mm, I hope it's very productive. - And what are you supposed to mean by that? (laughs) - I don't know. It feels like it's a little sweet revenge for me, you know? Seeing you go through the same thing that you put me through. - Look, I don't know what you talkin' about, all right? And ain't nobody gonna cheat on Big Hen. (laughs) 'Cause I know what I bring to the table. (laughs) - Big Hen? - Yes. - Oh, okay. I'll give you B plus at best. - B plus? - B plus. - Ooh, Henry, spike that ass. Oh my God, Henry, you knockin' my hip up outta place. Baby you 'bout to, ouch, ooh. - Really? Shh. - Henry. - Wow, come on. Okay, okay, okay. You have some A plus moments. But you not Mr. Consistency. - Mm. Now, Michael Jordan had a couple days off too, but he was still Michael Jordan. - Henry, Michael Jordan? No. I say you're like Scottie Pippen at best. But you not a Michael Jordan. - Whatever. (laughing) Thank you. - [Waitress] No problem. Enjoy. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - So, um, what's your next move? What you got goin' on in your life? - Well, I'm starting a new business. Some marketing internet play. (laughs) - I hope this is not another one of your get-rich-quick schemes, because the only person gettin' rich is the person sellin' to idiots like you. - Mm-hm. - Life is about hard work. Ain't no shortcuts. - Now, I don't take advice, especially business advice, from people who ride the bus. - Oh, come on, that is by choice. I'm on the bus because I'm tryin' to stack my money, okay? Unlike you, I have a financial plan. - Right, right. - Right. - Your financial plan is saving your money and spending mine. - Mm, well, I like that plan. - I don't. (laughing) Oh man, can I ask you something? - What? - No, it's fine. - No, what? - If all that stuff didn't happen with Chernise, do you think we would have been broken up? - Here we go. Chernise. You mean my coworker who you slept in our bed with? - She was giving me a massage. - See, Henry, come on, now. You know what? I'm about to go. - Look, come on, okay, wait. - Waiter! - Listen, wait, wait, listen. I shouldn't have brought that up. You forgave me for that. I mean, we went to the pastor and everything, and he prayed, and all of that. - Yeah, well, forgiveness is an operational word. I didn't forget. - Listen, I know you think I'm selfish. - Selfish? - Yes. - Yeah. - Well, I'm an only child, what do you expect? - Yeah, your mama still treat you like you're an only child. - Now, why you gotta bring my mama into this? - Well, I mean, you brought up Chernise, so I thought everything was fair game. - All right, speaking of games, let's play one. Ask me anything. Anything, and I promise I'll tell you the truth. - Anything? - [Henry] Mm-hm, mm. Anything. - Okay. Is she better than me? - Come on, why would you ask me that? Why would you ask me that? - Is she? Is she better than me? - All right, no. But her mic game, when she rockin' that mic, man. I can't lie. When she rockin' that mic, she-- - Really? - Okay, but when it comes to, you know, gettin' married and all of that stuff and settling down, I give that to you. - Then what does she do different than I did? - Well, she just, well, she had a couple different angles. She would just, she knew how to move her head a certain way, and it's just like, it works. - Oh, okay. Well, you know what? Stop, stop, stop, stop. Okay, that's enough. You know what, I didn't want to hear all of this. - Okay, well, you shouldn't have asked if you didn't wanna know. Now, you asked, and I tried to tell you. - Yeah, well, you have a lot to learn too about yourself, young man. About pressure points. - Oh, you don't even need to go there. - Yes, I do. - 'Cause we already done established I am the man. - You're the man? Okay, well, I need to hear that from somebody else besides yourself, then it might be true, Henry. - Ask her. Wanna ask? - Oh really? The man. The man, huh? Hold on, I think I gotta answer this phone call. I'll be right back. - Be my guest. - The man. - The man. (phone ringing) - What? - You on your way? You got the money? - Yeah, I'm-a leave in a second. I think he wants to talk with me. Girl, obviously he's been stood up. - Oh gosh, I woulda stood his lame, deadbeat ass up too. - All right, now, stop it. You know that's my baby daddy. - Girl, there you go, protectin' him again. - So Lindsay, I'm gonna need a quick favor. - Story of my life, Ty, what's up? - I had a drink, and I don't drink that much. Is it all right if you pick up little man for me? - Uh, okay, um, hold on. Okay, I can rearrange some things and make that happen. - Thank you. I owe you my life. - We've established that you owe me your life. Come up with somethin' better. - I appreciate you, I do. - Oh, you appreciate me, right? Okay, well, if you in Cartier, come out with the red box. (laughs) Okay, girl, take your time, do what you have to do. Just get your money, get out of there, and call me as soon as you're on your way. I got little man. - All right, bye, love you. - Oh, you know I love the kids. - Oh. Okay. - All right? So. You got the $100 for Little Henry's lavish trip. - Okay. Thank you. - You're welcome. You take care of yourself. Tyra. Tyra. Hey, come on. Come on, look, do you really need to go? Come on. Can't you just eat a little bit? - I really do need to go. - Why don't you just have a few bites and then you can go? I know you can eat real fast. - Shut up. - Look, I ordered your favorite. - You ordered for me? You know how much I hate when you do that. - No. You love when I do that. That's a woman's code for that turns me on. - All right. - [Henry] So? - All right, I'll... Well, it isn't safe out here. And I am hungry. Come on. - Come on. - All right. No, I do remember the time when you were, like, on that boat and you fell off, and then you were screaming like a little girl, like help me, save me. - I was not screamin' like a little girl. - Yes, you was. - That was a manly scream. - Mm-hm. - Besides that, black people and water don't mix really well. - You can't say that, because I'm black and I can swim. - Well, you didn't jump in to help me. - No, because at the time I had that life insurance policy, and I was thinkin' about that mansion in Miami. - You know you can't leave without me, and especially not down in Miami. - Yeah, well, I don't know about that. Why don't you try me? Let's go rent a boat or a canoe and see what happens. - You would jump in to save me. - I don't know. I mean, you know what, that park ranger did a good enough job. He was... - You would jump in to save me. - Okay. I would save you. - Can I ask you somethin'? - [Tyra] What? - Personal question. - No. - Do you ever think about me? Do you ever think about us? - No, because I have Lamont now. - Fuckin' Lamont. Lamont? You know you don't even love Lamont. That bastard. Look at him. Look at Lamont, and look at me, huh? There is no comparison. Now, back to what I asked you. Do you ever think about us? - I can't answer that. - Figures. You know. - Oh my gosh. - Why do you keep lookin' at the girl over there? - What is that girl lookin' at? Why does she keep starin' over here? Somethin's going on or somethin'. I'm gonna come over there and tell her about herself in a second. - Well, why are you... Please. Why are you so ghetto? You can take the girl outta the ghetto, but you cannot take the ghetto outta the girl. - Don't say it. You know I hate when you call me ghetto. Besides, you the one who grew up in the projects. I wouldn't even step foot over in your neighborhood after 5:30 p.m. - Ain't nothin' wrong with being raised in the projects. Jay-Z came from the projects. - Well, my dad was a high school principal. Oh, and you aren't no Jay-Z. - And you damn sure ain't Beyonce. - That's why I can't stand you. You just have a smart mouth. - Yeah, well, I mean, you tryin' to make everybody think that I'm from the ghetto. You know I'm sensitive about that. - Why are you sensitive? Why don't you embrace being from the hood? - I do embrace being from the hood. Nothing wrong with being from the hood. It's how I got my street smarts. And I wouldn't get played by nobody like Lamont 'cause I got street smarts. - Oh, what is that supposed to mean? - What do you mean, what is it supposed to mean? I'm on the road, I'm a salesman. I'm gone all the time. Hell, you know what he doin'. - You know, why don't you focus on your own relationship and get outta mine? - I do focus on my relationship. She makes good money, and she has a job, unlike you. - Oh yeah? - Yes. - Well, where is this good woman of yours? - [Henry] Takin' care of business. (laughs) - Oh, and you believe that yourself? - Yeah, I believe it. Why wouldn't I? - Oh. Mm. - I'm done here. You know what? I'm gonna go pay this bill, and when I get back, you be gone. How about that? - Yeah, go ahead, pay this bill. It's the least you can do. - The least I can do. - I'm-a be right here drinkin' my drink. - [Henry] Right. - Excuse me, ma'am. I'm sorry, I don't mean to be nosy. - Then why are you being nosy? What do you want? I saw you over there, sticking your nose all in my business. What, you wanna knuckle up? - Listen, again, I'm very, very sorry. I just couldn't help to overhear about you and your boyfriend? - No. Ex-husband. - Well, I couldn't help to hear you and your ex-husband arguing. Seems like you guys have a lot of pent-up anger against each other. - Excuse me, but how is that any of your business? - Well, to be honest, I can't help it. My ear is kinda tuned to these type of things. I'm a professional counselor. I specialize in broken relationships. - Yeah, well, this relationship, it can't use any of your help. - You'd be surprised. I've helped a lot of couples come back from the brink. - We are well beyond the brink. - Mm, I don't think so. I mean, just like anything else in life, it all depends on how much work you're willing to put in, but-- - Listen, I know you're the expert and all, but I disagree. - Well, look, here's my card. If you can convince him to come, you never know. You guys might be able to work things out, get back together. - Yeah. I know you're an optimist and all, but I don't have any money. - If you can convince him to come, it'll be on me. - Okay, whatever. - You have a great day, ma'am. - You too. Hm. - My God, you get on my nerves. I should never have let you sit down with me. - Oh, you let me sit down? - You know what? I'm gonna call you Uber, so you can take your ass home. (laughs) - You only let me sit down because you were lonely. - I was not lonely. I let you sit down because I... Whatever. I shouldn't have let you sit down. Now my damn phone, I got a surge because of that damn Uber. - Cheap. Cheap phone. - What do you mean, I'm cheap? I shoulda put your ass back on the bus. - Look at you. I'm supposed to be the mother of your child, and that's how you talk to me? - Yeah, you're the mother of my child, but sometimes you just get on my nerves. It's always like this. You know what? I'll stand out here, wait on the bus, whatever I gotta do, 10 more minutes, but I gotta get up for work in the morning. - Aw, you don't have to get up for no work. What does your work consist of, thumbing through, like, ads? - You know what, whatever. - Oh, whatever. - Yes, whatever. Why you always gotta bother me, anyway? I would leave your ass out here, but I know a homeless guy's gonna drag you in the back of the alley, so I'll wait with you. I'm a big girl, I could take care of myself. - Your daddy is a principal. And I'm from the ghetto, remember? So I'll say out here, and I'll wait with you. As I always do. - Oh, and that's the least you can do, you know? - [Henry] Look, my hotel is right up there. I'll go and get my car, and we can just drive you home like that. How about that? - Wait a minute. Let me answer it. (phone buzzes) - Well, whoever it is, maybe they can come pick your ass up. What's wrong with you? Who the hell is that? - Hold up, my phone. - What? - My phone. - Oh, you and that damn cell phone. Don't answer it. - Hey, baby, I'm on call. It could be a client. Sorry, just gimme a second. - You pharmaceutical guys are so strange. - [Henry] Listen, let's just go down here, and I can just go get my car-- - Hold on. - Who was on the phone? You never said nothin'. How the hell are you-- - I'm-a need a stiff one. - Tyra, come on, look. I don't have all night. I gotta get up for work in the morning. - He loves me. - Please, just stop. Can you stop? - He loves me not. - Will you quit, please? You know what, this is what I'm talkin' about. I'm not looking at her, and she crosses her legs. Just stop it. - What? - Stay here with me. Got a view for it. - Oh, stop it. - Get your hands off. Come on, come on. - All right, I'm bein' serious. Therapist. Give us therapy. - [Therapist] I think that you guys need to let each other talk one at a time. - I think this starts getting shorter and shorter. (laughing) - [Therapist] And. - All right, go ahead. Every time I say something to you, - Babe. you're writing something in that book. She's writing in the book. - [Therapist] So, how do you feel that he has someone else? - How do I feel that he has someone else? Don't do that to me. See, I hate that. - What do you mean, you hate that? Just, can you figure something out? Just talk to her. Talk to her. - [Therapist] You guys obviously love each other. - Please get off of me. - [Therapist] Or else you guys wouldn't be here. - I'm here because of my son, all right? It's the only reason I'm here, because I wanna get along with his mother. That's all she is to me, my son's mother. Shit. - Shut up. - Look, you know what? That's what I'm talkin' about. - Okay, so. As I was saying. - [Henry] What do you want us to tell you? - How does PDA make you feel? - PDA? PDA, you know what that acronym stands for? - Yes. - From the projects. - No, see, you see how nice, I'm tryin' to be nice to her. But every time I be nice to her, then she always has to say something that I don't like. - Well, you know I have a sarcastic mouth. - You just, you have more than that. Your mouth is not the problem. - [Therapist] Okay, Tyra. What is the reason for your sarcasm? - I feel like whatever you're writing in that book, I want to make sure that it doesn't go anywhere else. - [Therapist] Oh, no. This is strictly confidential. - She's lying. I seen something she wrote about something else. She's been writing about people forever. - The reason for my sarcasm-- - Sarcasm. - I know. Okay, I'm pickin' up your tendencies. You the one that's ghetto. - Yeah, yeah. You are ghetto. - No, I'm not, I'm from Burbank. You from the projects. - Why the hell do you keep saying that like you-- - And you always make these references. - Burbank got ghetto parts. Obviously. - I'm done. - Let's just get outta here. - This has got to be the worst case ever. It's so complicated. I feel like every time I know what I'm doing, three more things pop up. - Well, that's what we get paid to do, deal with the headaches. - My whole life is a headache right now. - How so? Life should be great. You're young, beautiful, smart. You should, you should have no worries. - If only that was the case. All I do is worry. - You're gonna have to let that go. You're gonna start seeing gray hairs pop up. Look at me, 20 years of worry, 20 years of gray. - Well, it makes you look very distinguished. - Then I must look very distinguished. - Well, it just so happens I like older men. - Oh. Well, what do you say we get outta here and have a drink? - Why don't we go have a drink and go over the case? - The Jones case. - The Jones case. - The Jones. - The Jones case. (laughs) (Tyra laughs) - So crazy. I'm so glad you told them off the way you did. I been meanin' to say somethin', but I didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable. - Please. You know, you always had an issue with that. I ain't never had no problems tellin' people how I feel. - No, you haven't, not at all. - You like it. You always liked me bein' your protector. - Okay, I'll give you that, I'll give you that. You always defended me. Sometimes you were a little too aggressive, but for the most part you made me feel safe. - What are you talkin' about, aggressive? My right hook is a monster, like Lennox Lewis, baby. - Okay, I don't know who Lennox Lewis is, but you probably aren't as half as tough as he is. - See, there you go again, tryin' to tear me down. You better be glad I'm a mama's boy. I lack confidence. - Henry, that's part of the problem. You're a mama's boy. Maybe if you wasn't a mama's boy, our relationship coulda lasted a little bit longer. - What are you talkin' about? I'm an only child. I'm supposed to be a mama's boy. - Oh. Can I give you some advice? - Yeah. - It's time for you to take your mouth off your mama's nipple slowly. - Okay, wait a minute. What about you? Shoppin' at Amazon, wearin' it one time, and then sendin' it back. - What? - Yeah, that's ghetto as hell. - Baby, you know it relaxes me. - And then what? What's gonna happen when Amazon sends the FBI to your house and have your ass somewhere else, then what? - FBI? Come on. All I do is buy stuff and then I send it back in the mail. I adhere to the return policy. - No, what you adhere to is being ghetto as hell. (laughs) - You know, sometimes I think about all the nights I spent alone, building this practice, all the hours of solitude, of worry, and sometimes I I wonder if everything I missed out on was worth it. I mean, it was my dream, and I'm here now, but... You know, I think to myself, is this it? Does that make sense? - I think you did exactly what you had to do to achieve your goals, and, I mean, isn't that what life is all about? Achieving, right? - That's what I thought. Yeah, that's what I thought. - I think you're getting a little tipsy. I mean, who wouldn't want to be rich and well respected in their field? I mean, what more can you ask for in a man? I love ambition. - Oh, do you, now? - I just like a go-getter. I mean, I try to get Henry to get off his behind and do something, but it seems like every time he gets up, he falls right back on his face. And I want to support him, but I just don't have the patience for it, you know? - Everybody doesn't have it in them. It's a long, tough road to success. - Yeah, well, I don't want to wait around while he's trying to figure it out. - Do you love him? (laughing) - You know what? Let's do a toast. To finally gettin' along. - You're right. - And to even maybe being friends. - I like how that sounds. - For Little Henry's sake. - I'll toast to that. - For Little Henry. - Again, let's toast. - For Little Henry. Jesus, what am I gettin' myself into? (laughing) - Hey, this my drink. - So damn ghetto. - You love it. Mm. - [Henry] Oh my God. (laughing) - Go get me another drink. - Be right back. - All right. (phone ringing) Hello? - Hey. - Lindsay. How's everything goin' with Little Henry? - Da da doo! Woo! - Is that him in the background that I hear? He should be in the bed. - You shoulda told me that a long time ago. Or 10 Twinkies ago. - 10 Twinkies? Girl, I'm gonna kill you. - I want him to love me. - You want me to hate you, that's what you want. Girl, put him to bed. (laughs) - Okay, well, we're gonna have to practice Zumba, and then we're gonna go to bed. - Girl, I'm gonna kill you. Seriously? - Sound like your meeting is productive. Might let him dust them cobwebs off that thing for you. - Shut up, Lindsay. Girl, nothin's gonna happen. - Well, hopefully somethin' happens, and you can loosen up a little bit, always on my case. - Look, let me call you back in about a hour. And put Henry back to bed. - That's good, I gotta go anyway. Uh-huh. Okay. Ready? Go. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Come on, let's do the video. - Do you love him? - I thought I did for a minute. But now I'm not so sure. - Well, after three divorces, take it from me, there is nothing unsure about love. If you're not sure, you're not in love. - You're probably right. - What is it that irks you about him the most? I mean, what is it, is it one thing, is it a lot of things? - I don't know, I guess it's just he can't get his act together. I mean, he starts these businesses, and he doesn't follow through, and I mean, I guess he tries hard, but trying just isn't good enough for me. I want him to win. - Failure is part of success. I started some businesses before this one. Didn't work out, but I stuck to it, 'cause, hell, you never know. - Yeah, well, I don't know if I want to stick around to figure out what's going on with him. I mean, I want to live my life, and I want to live it right now. - I hear that, baby. - And plus, he does this really weird thing with my feet where he likes to kiss my toes, and-- - Uh-uh, uh-uh. - I think he thinks it's turning me on, and I really don't like it. - Tea about that. Tea about a little toe jam between the teeth. - Hey, there's no toe jam over here. - I don't know, I might have to do a little inspection myself. - Hey, check 'em out. - Right up here. Put 'em up here, lemme see. - Check 'em out, check 'em out. - Let me see. Put it right there. Mm-hm. You know, you a funny girl. Amazing sense of humor, you know, for a girl with a face like... And that body. - Are you flirting with me, Mr. Owens? - Well, you can take it however you want. You said you liked a go-get-her. - Ready? Five, six, seven, eight. - You know you love me. I love everybody. I love everybody! - Shh! - Woo! - Okay, okay. - Uh, what? - You can love everybody. * I love everybody, baby. - Come on. - Woman, you acting like old school. - Oh, no, that's for your girlfriend. - Why you always gotta bring up Kara? You always do that, though, right? - Come on. (car door closing) (clears throat) - Oh, shit. Oh my God, the phone was on the whole time. Oh, shit. Shit! - So about that promotion. - Oh, anything you want, baby. Anything you want. * I need your help, babe. - Isaac and Lowell. Will you help me sing this? - Come on, we gotta sit down. I need a break from carrying your big ass all night. - All right. - [Tyra] Sit down. Take a break. - I can't sit down here. Oh. Oh, shit. Oh. - Out late at night, messin' around with your ass. You know what I'm sayin'? - [Kara] So about that promotion. - [Owens] Anything you want. - Company car? - You pick the color. - Corner office? - Right across from mine. - Expense account? - Well, now, you gonna have to work a little harder for that. Ooh, yippee yi yi ay. Ha ha! - [Henry] Don't act like you don't know what I'm talkin' about. - Man, you got me out here all late at night like I'm 18 years old. - 18? - [Tyra] Yes, late at night. - I remember when you was 18 year old, baby. Let me tell you somethin', you looked so sexy as one of the best cheerleaders, cheerin' over there. Ooh, you was so sexy. I saw you do that split, look right at me. You was like... (laughs) - Yeah, I know you was lookin' at me, actin' all super-thirsty. - What do you think we went wrong at, then? - Well, you was lookin' at all those gold-lookin' women when you had this diamond-lookin' woman in your pocket. - Baby, that's the story of my life. - Yeah, well, it's no need in rehashin' over, you know, the past. What's done is what's done. - Right. 'Cause you, you can't, like, press the rewind button when it comes to life. - No, but you gotta take life serious. You know, what you have, you can't take it for granted, what you have, because when it's gone, it might just be gone forever. - Baby, listen, I understand that. But at the end of the day, I made wrong turns. You don't think I know that you're a good woman? And sometimes I regret it. - Yeah. - But I don't doubt one thing. - What? I'm a good woman? - You're a good woman. - Thank you. - You ain't stupid. - Thank you. I like how you talkin'. - But I'm cute. - You're cute, yeah. I like how you talkin'. You know what? - What? - [Tyra] You need to drink Crown more often, 'cause I like this conversation. - Yeah, I drink Clo--Cro--Crown. Crown make you clown. - You still so corny. - But you like that, don't you? Come here. - Mm-mm, mm-mm. Let me call your girlfriend. - Aw, no, no, no, no, don't call her. - What's her number? - I'm-a give you my phone. Here's the hotel key. I'm in room * 112 * Ooh * Whoa, woo - I don't know if I'm comin'. I don't know if I'm comin' to your hotel room. I gotta go. - Come to room 112, baby. - Uh-uh. - That's where all the magic happens, baby. - Look, I'm not comin' to your room. I need to check on my son. - Put your hands lower down here. - Stop. - Make me feel good in my special parts. - Henry. - What do you mean, you gonna check on your son? It's my son too. - Henry. - Henry's fine. - [Tyra] Ugh. * I know you love * I know you love me, baby (snores) (Henry laughs) - Ugh, stop. - You gonna come back to my hotel room and let me bang them back out for you again? - No. You better save that for your girlfriend. (coughs) - What? Oh, that's nasty. - Oh, it ain't nasty. C'mere, let me suck your toes. - Stop! - C'mere. - Don't touch me. - Let me breathe on you. * Baby - Gettin' on the table? Yeah, um... - Is there a problem? Do we have an issue here, Lamont? - Yeah, I'm in the, literally in the middle of somethin'. - Okay. I'll call you later. (snores) - [Henry] I don't want this to change anything. - [Charise] It won't. God, you're so tense. - Maybe because I'm just not ready. - Me neither. - [Henry] Okay, now, listen-- - Don't. - I know what it looks like. Look, look, Tyra, I just-- - [Tyra] Stop. - No, no, no, listen. I just told her that it-- - Stop. Henry, don't say anything to me right now. - Wait-- - How could you stoop this low? What the fuck? - No, no, no, it's not what you think. Listen-- - No, it is what I think. - Listen. I just, I just, I just told her-- - Henry. I been standin' here the whole time, watchin' you with this skank. - Then you should know that I was gonna stop this. - You know what? You're full of fuckin' lies, Henry. I just can't be with you anymore. Look what you doin'. In our bed? Our bed? Why? - [Henry] I have no excuse. - You know what, I hate you so much right now. I hate you so much. - Now, come on, Tyra, look. I just, I just stopped it. - I wanna beat her ass so bad. - [Henry] I know you do, but Tyra, listen to me. It's not what you think. I stopped it. You know we haven't been-- - You know what, I hate you so much. You hurt me over and over and over again. - [Henry] Because we, we-- - Infidelity? Really? That's what you wanna do? I mean fuck you, Henry! - [Henry] Tyra, we've hurt each other. - No. - [Henry] And you know that. - You don't love me. You don't love me. I hate you! - Listen, Tyra! Tyra, listen. Fuck, fuck. Tyra! Fuck! Goddammit! Shit! - You know what? One thing that I always hated about you? You used to always leave your dirty sock on the bathroom floor. - [Henry] What? - It was a small thing, but you used to always do it consistently, and I wanted to inflict so much pain on you. And then I realized it wasn't the socks. - Then what was it? - It was the fact that you took me for granted. I used to always try to keep a clean home and keep you together, but then I realized you was just takin' me for granted. - What, baby, because of the laundry? - No. No! - Tyra, Tyra! Come on! What are you doin'? All right, look, look-- - [Tyra] You're all of you fuckin' neanderthals. - What's wrong with me? C'mere. Oh. - What's wrong with me? - Nothin', baby, nothin', nothin'. - Why don't you love me? - I love you. I love you. I love you. I just don't care how she feels. You know why? Because when somebody bangs it into you for two years, that they don't care, they do everything they can to get under your skin, everything they can to show you that you're not appreciated, then what am I supposed to do, huh? Tears don't mean shit to me. Cry. - [Therapist] And what's making you cry, hon'? What exactly is hitting it? - He just doesn't listen. - [Therapist] There's obviously a reason, Henry, why you came here. You still obviously care about her. - Of course I care about her. - [Therapist] And this is why you get upset, correct? - Of course I care about her. - [Therapist] Okay. Tell me three nice things about her. - I would bend over backwards to make her feel special, and she would always outdo me, makin' me feel even more special. And I hate the fact that I can't communicate with her. I hate the fact that we can't, we can't fight. I didn't just say you. Do you see what I'm sayin'? I said us, that we can't communicate. That we can't just get along. We have to get along for our son. That's just not what I wanna do. And she should be able to respect that. I can respect us bein' together. Listen, I'll tell you, I can respect, listen, listen, no, I can respect us bein' together as parents. - You know what, it is what it is at this point. - [Therapist] But how does that make you feel? - It's nothin' I can say more or do. - Do I wanna be in a relationship with her right now? Absolutely not. - [Therapist] You're using the keyword right now. Why is that? - I'm using the keyword right now because we're sitting here with you right now. I don't, tomorrow's not promised to any of us. But what I can say is this. As of right now, I need my space emotionally from her. I don't wanna be in a relationship. I want a partnership to raise our son together. That's what I'm lookin' for. - I don't know anymore. You know, you try to make things right, and sometimes it just goes wrong. So what's the point of figuring things out anymore, huh? - Hey. - Hm? - Did we? - Yeah. - What? Please. No, we didn't. - Only if you were dreaming. - You just better be glad I was drunk. - Hm, whatever. - If I was on that Jack, baby, I'd have been blowin' that back out. - Mm. - This is funny. - Yeah. - Here we are, divorced, and cheatin' with each other. - Yeah. - Life is crazy, baby. - This show has to be over. I know Lindsay is gonna kill me. - No, Kara's gonna kill me. - Oh. She's gonna go hysterical. - Oh my God, what am I thinkin'? - We gotta get goin'. Okay. You use the bathroom first. (snores) - Did I promise that ho a corner office? Oh shit, I know I ain't promised that no corner office. It was good, but not that good. Oh shit, let me check my wallet. - So I'm gonna go and head over and catch the bus. - Don't catch the bus. I can take you home. - Eh, I only have two bus stops. I'm good. - You sure? - No, no, no, it's fine. I'm good. Okay? - Tyra! - What? - [Kara] Henry, what the fuck is this? I knew you were still fuckin' with that bitch. - Excuse me? - [Henry] No, wait. Tyra, just wait-- - Uh-uh, uh-uh. - Calm down. - No way! I'll show you exactly what a bitch can do. - Listen, just think positive thoughts. - You know what? It's okay. You can have him. I was all set last night anyway. - Kara, where were you last night? - I was laid up with a rich man, givin' me everything you could never give me, you broke, worthless piece of shit. - Who are you talkin' to? You skank! What? - Just like I thought. Bunch of ghetto lowlifes. Y'all are meant for each other. - You know what? I can't believe she did this. This is exactly what I expected. I knew she was cheatin'. - You know you deserve way better than that. - Yeah, I know that. I know, but I pushed 'em all away, Tyra, you know that. - Why? - Because they ain't you. - That's the nicest thing you said to me in, like, two years. Look, if you're serious about us, let's try one more time. You know, for our son. - I'm willing to try again too. C'mere. - Oh, you know what, I forgot my comb. It's back at the hotel room. You still have the key? - How'd I know you was gonna try to get back up in that hotel room, sniffin' all on the sheets? You forgot that comb on purpose. - It's my favorite comb. - Right. - I'll be right back. - All right. Hey, I'm gonna need you to pick up Little Henry today when you get off, all right? Did you hear what I said? Hello? - Yeah, I heard what you said. - Okay, why didn't you answer me, then? - Because I already told you I have a doctor's appointment today. I told you that once before. - Didn't we talk about this last week? I told you I had to work late every day this week. Why should I have to tell you to pick up your son? The fuck is the problem? Do somethin' in this fuckin' relationship. Do somethin' productive for once. Make the fuckin' bed or somethin'. You don't do shit right around here anymore. You know, I gotta pick up our son. I have to make up the bed. I have to cook dinner. I mean, what do you do? - I clean the house, I cook, and I have to take care of my son because sometimes you nowhere to be found. But you know what, that's okay. I'll get Little Henry today, don't you worry about it. Get my keys and go to work. - Good. Did you cheat on me? - No, I didn't cheat on you. But why did you cheat on me, hm? - You know why I cheat. Listen, I cheated on you, and I take full responsibility for it. I cheated on you because I did that. Simple. I could sit here and tell you that we were growing far apart. You knew that. You could see every day. We argued every day, like... Either way, whoever cheated, it doesn't matter. It's a person. - It does matter. It always matters. I don't know what you talkin' about. - So explain to me why it matters, then. Explain why it matters. - Cheatin' matters. Whoever does the cheatin'. - Yes, but explain if it's you, you just don't wanna be the one that's cheat, is that what you're sayin'? 'Cause explain to me how it's different if it's you or me. Doesn't matter. We're the ones in the marriage. - You only cheated, and I didn't cheat. How would you feel? - I'm not sayin' that. That's the question. - No, answer the question. - No. - Answer the question. - If both of us have cheated, no matter who cheated first. - Answer the question. Answer that question. - No. - Answer that question. - If, if, it doesn't matter-- - See? No! Stop, I won't. - Of course. How do you think? No, you're not listenin'. It doesn't matter. - I'm not listenin'? Tit for tat. I might cheat on you. - Okay, okay, so but what I'm sayin' is-- - So don't let me catch you. - If I cheated-- - I'll cheat on you. - I'm sayin' this, if I cheated, then-- - Oh my God. At least he admitted to somethin'. Thanks for bein' honest. - If one person cheated, - I didn't cheat. - It doesn't matter. - I didn't cheat. I didn't cheat. - You just don't wanna be the one that cheated. - Oh my gosh. - I don't care. But it doesn't make a difference if you cheated or if I cheated. - Henry. - Separately. It doesn't matter. - Henry. - What? - Why you talkin' over me? - Because it's the same shit every time with you. You just, listen, you see how it is with her. She, there is no answer but her answer. And we're goin' around and around for no reason. I'm human, and I want to be loved, I want to be touched, I want to be hugged, and someone came along and said some of the things I wish you were sayin', you know? But I still take full responsibility that I cheated on you. That's why I'm sittin' here. I cheated on you, and it was wrong. - I'm trying to fight for us. - Yeah, but which, what makes it different-- - Then why would I fight for us, then, if I cheated? - I'm tryin' to fight for us too! - Then I would be backpedaling. - That's not necessarily true. - Like, fuck it, let's try to save the relationship. - So. I take responsibility for that. And at this point, I just... I want to know if you can forgive me. - Yeah. Yeah, I could forgive you. Ugh. You fell asleep on the couch. All right. Hope you said your prayers. Love you. - Mommy. - Yeah. - If I have a nightmare, would Daddy come back home and protect me? - Why do you keep lickin' me like that? (laughing) - 'Cause you like it. - Uh-huh. Get me all frisky, and then you're mm-hmm. - You're supposed to cook for me tonight. I don't know if I should be frisky with you. - Come on, I'll cook for you all the time. Little Henry's not here. - What? - Well, Little Henry's not here, so-- - Babe, you heat up food for me all the time. You don't make food from scratch. But that's okay. - What the fuck is wrong with hot dogs and tater tots? - That is so nasty. - But baby, I'm cookin', though. (laughing) - Mm. - Oh, baby. - Mm. - What? - Gimme a real kiss. - Of course. - I love you. - I love you too, baby. A whole lot. - You know, it's just us living here now. But you got your mommmy. I like the new office space. - Yeah. - It's nice. - You're movin' up. Guess we're payin' her good. - Yeah. You want me to tell him the three things that I hate about him? Oh. Okay, it's more than three. No, I'm just jokin', it's not more than three. The three things that I hate about you is that sometimes you don't listen to me, and I keep telling you that, and I'll tell you I have a doctor's appointment, and you'll forget. Or I'll tell you can you pick up Henry from school, Henry Junior... (clears throat) See? - I'm listening to you. I don't forget. But I'm listening. Oh boy. Three things that I don't like about you. Well, I don't like your stubbornness. I think that when we have disagreements or anything it's just so hard gettin' past the way you feel. If you think you're right, then there's no listening to anything else but the way you feel. - Yeah, I'm stubborn. At times. But, I mean, it's somethin' that I can work on for you. You know? - Yeah. - The second thing that I hate about him is that, I mean, I have to push him to flirt with me and be affectionate. Sometimes you just don't do it automatically, and it's like hey, hello, cuddle or somethin' like that. - You know what it is? - What is it? - It's the difficulties that we have, we're having, and it pushes me away. Like it's hard to want to cuddle with you after you've just cursed me out. I don't like that you don't like my friends. - I mean, I don't like his friends, but... - None of 'em. - None of 'em. I mean, he just makes friends easily, with everybody. - No, I'm just talkin' about the friends I've had for a long time. - Oh, those. The ones that he always goes on a guys' trips with. - You know, these are people that were in my life for years. It puts me in a weird position, because I love them, but I love you, you know, and I wanna honor that vow that I made to you, but I have people that I think are still really wonderful people. And if they disrespected you or anything like that, then it would be different, but just to kinda not like 'em because I'm not spending that time with you, that's just, that kinda hurts me, because I just feel like it's a constant fight. - Okay, okay, okay, look. I will be more open minded about your friends. - Good. And I will cut the trips in half. I won't go on as many guy trips. - Thank you. - And the third thing. I don't like the fact that you, you weave your mother's opinion in our marriage so much. I didn't marry your mother, I married you. And I love your mother. I'm gonna be honest with you. I can't say that when I see you're doing somethin' like we talked about before that I'm gonna hug you and put you in my arms after you made me feel a certain way. I'm not ready for that yet. - That's the third thing that I hate about him is that he always says can't, won't, don't. I'm not. I mean, if he would just change his language up some, then we would have-- - But I always say that? You said I always? Always. Like, it's just, it's never a time that I say anything else but that. - Yes. A lot, well, a lot of times, majority of the time, you know what I'm talkin' about. Most of the time he knows what I'm talkin' about. I mean, he hates the fact that I'm close with my mom? Who says that? - I never said that. - Who does that? Who thinks that? - I love the fact that you love your mom. 'Cause it shows-- - Thank you. - Your mom's a wonderful person. I mean, what else do you want me to say when it's somethin' that we can't do? - Can't. - Right, but we can't do everything. I can't say yes to everything. When I say no, I should be able to say no without any explanation. - Babe. You could say I'm gonna work on that. I'll try to do that. - But what are we talkin' about here? You just said you don't like when I say the words can't and don't. I mean, that's kinda just out there. - No, every time we get into a disagreement, instead of saying I can't do that, I won't do that, I shouldn't, you should just say I'm-a work on that. Maybe that's possible. - I just want us to be able to make decisions for us, by us. You know? I want us to be the first team when it comes to making our decisions. And all the other outside influences, let 'em be outside influences and not, you know, be a part of what we're doin'. I'll look at things and try to say that I can try somethin' different. Even if it's outside of my comfort zone. I'll try to say that I can or I will or, you know? Listen, for you, I'll say, I'm here to say whatever I need to say and do what I need to do. - Babe. I can work on that for us. I can. - And I have a great relationship with her. I love her. It's my mother-in-law. - I'll work on that. - Listen, hearin' you say this, it just means the world to me. And I wanna work on this as hard or even harder. - Oh. - Ugh. All right, c'mere. Talk to me. What's goin' on? - Babe, I think we should go to couples therapy. - Oh, come on. Couples therapy, Tyra? - Yeah. - Shit. Okay. - Really? - Yeah, let's do it. I'm in. - My grandma was a wise woman. Everything is not supposed to make sense. That was something my grandma Pam used to say. She lived to be 92 before we laid her to rest. She was smiling and kind. She told me to remember one thing. A man will treat you exactly the way you allow him to. And that the road to self-respect was not an easy one and that you may not like what you find along the way. But the last part, the most important part, came from the wisdom of being married for over 70 years. She would always say that sometimes a real love is worth fighting for. Okay, the three things that I like. - I'd say her sense of humor. I love it. (laughs) - I like his smile, right? Oof, see? - Now I'm blushin'. You just can't tell 'cause I'm black. - Okay, okay, okay, okay, wait, you got some... See? I love his smile. The three things I like about Henry, I love his smile. He just glows. And it just warms my heart and makes me feel a certain way. - Well, I love your eyes. I've always loved your eyes. It seems like you can look right through me. - And then I like the fact that he works out. I mean, he got a body. He got a body. Uh... - I love your sense of humor. I think your sense of humor is just like mine. That's always been great. - I know I'm a lot to deal with, but uh... Just the fact that he sticks it out. A lot of men don't stick it out. And, um, he stuck it out with me. Longevity, commitment. I like that. - It's not puttin' up with you. - Yeah, well, you know what? He gets me and understands me like nobody else. - Everybody has their ways. I mean, we were all made differently on purpose. So that's why I love you. - I love you too. I do. Oh, oh! I want to add a fourth thing that I like about Henry. I like how he serenades me. I mean, he can sing. Go ahead. * You are * The most beautiful girl * In the world to me * To me - See? - You are.
