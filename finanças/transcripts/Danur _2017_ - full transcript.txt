My name is Risa. And I can see what many of you call... ...ghosts. What are you going to do today, Risa? I promise I'll be home early today. So, we can celebrate your birthday together. Hey. Do you know what present you want for your birthday? Hey. Okay. I got to go now. I need to visit grandma at the hospital. Hey, sweetheart. Please behave. Don't forget to eat and pray. If you need anything, ask for Sum or Ujang. Okay, sweetheart? Okay, sweetheart? Your phone. Yes. Don't forget to call Dad. I'm sure he has a gift for you. Bye, sweetheart. Since my childhood, I have always been left home alone. My father works overseas. He's back once every six months. Me and my Mom live at my grandmother's home. Mom is always busy. Not to mention visiting grandma at the hospital. So, I was mostly alone. Happy birthday, Risa. This year, I just want to have a friend. So, I will not be alone anymore. Did you see our friend? Janshen. Can I play too? Risa? Risa? Risa! Risa? Risa, why have you scribbled on the floor? And please clean up your toys. Risa? Risa, are you asleep? Did you guys scribble on the floor? Hello. Yes. Oh, yes, I'll call you back. Morning, sweetheart. Hi. Happy birthday. May you always be well, smart and beautiful as always. Sorry, I came home very late last night. I got a present for you. I wanted to give it to you last night but you were asleep. You’re a grown up. So, you need to clean up your toys. And do not scribble on the floor, sweetheart. It wasn't me. Come here, come. Come. What scribble, Mom? Where did you guys learn that song ? That's a Sundanese song. Peter doesn't looks like a Sundanese. My nanny taught me, Risa. Of course I'm not a Sundanese. Risa, stop. Let's get out of here, Risa. Let's go home. Don't ever play here again. Why? Did you learn a new song? Who taught you? Some friends. What friends? You don't know them. They are my new friends. Ujang. Risa played with whom today? She was alone. I did not see any kids other than Risa. Are you sure? I saw she was laughing alone. There were no other children. I'm worried she's possessed. That's nonsense, Ujang. What do you think if we discuss this with Mr. Asep? -He is my grandfather's friend, right? -Yes. -The psychic? -Yes. I'm going to see a psychiatrist. They are the experts. Let's call Mr. Asep first. I fear there's a demon here. You lose, Peter. It's William's turn now. Risa, you're not asleep yet? Just another minute, Mom. Don't stay up too late, dear. Next week the school will start. You need to get used to waking up early. Okay, Mom. Your turn, William. Hello, Sinta. It's me, Eli. Thank you for coming, Sin. It's been a long time, El. It's been how long? Since Risa was born. And now she's going to have a little sister. -How many months now? -Five. -Congratulations. -Thank you. So, yesterday you saw her playing alone? Playing by herself, laughing by herself. As if she was talking to someone. I heard her mention two names but it was not clear. So, Risa was talking to more than one person? She was just having breakfast here. Risa? Risa, come here. I want you to meet Aunt Sinta. Risa? Come here, I need to talk to you. Risa? Come out. Come on. Risa! -What are you doing there? -I'm playing hide and seek. Playing with whom? With my friends. Don't lie to me. I don't see anyone here. Janshen, William, come out. Peter, I'm not hiding anymore. Where are your friends? There they are. Janshen, William, wait! El. Sorry but I'm not sure I can help you. -I'm sorry. -Sinta? Sin! Sinta! Sin! Sin! I'm sorry. I don't think this is a psychological problem, El. I'm sorry. Why can't my mother see you guys? Because we only want to play with you. So my mother can't meet you guys? Not everyone can see us, Risa. Are you not my neighbors? Who are you guys? I was born and raised in Indonesia. I never lived in the Netherlands. Thats why I speak like a native. My parents were shot when the Japanese invaded. That night, after my father died, the Japanese came to this house. They killed me that night. Since then, I live with the others. They also died in this house. The others? William, Janshen, you too? Yes. We all died in this house. Are you afraid of us, Risa? Risa? Risa? Risa? Risa? Risa? Do you still want to play with us? I want to be with you guys all the time. Forever. Come with us. Ma'am, quickly find Risa. Risa? Risa? Risa? Risa? Risa? Risa! Risa! Risa, don't! Let go, Risa. Don't! Risa, come here. Go inside, sweetheart. Risa? Pray. I don't want to be with you. I want to be with Peter. Pray. Pray, Risa. Pray. -Risa. -I'm not lying. -My friends are real. -Risa? Risa, I know, but they are not human. But they're not evil. I want to be with them. Yes. You have a gift. I've touched your ribs. Ma'am, she has loose ribs. Such a child cannot be left alone and daydreaming. Risa, try to smell this. It's fishy. This is called Danur. You must have smelled this ever since you met them. It's the smell of a dead body. Do you want to see what your real friends look like? Now, open your eyes. Open your eyes. Open your eyes, Risa. I wish I had never opened my eyes that day. Because after that, I never saw them again. Are you sure it's okay to come back here again? No one is taking care of grandma. Andri cannot take care of grandma. Until Aunt Tina can find a new nurse. Alright. But remember, don't let those things happen again. Don't be silly, okay? You have to take care of grandma. You need to watch Riri, too. Okay, Mom. I understand, I promise. Mom, let's go inside. Aunt Eli? Dri, sorry for being late. It's okay. As a matter of fact, you're on time. Brother Andri! Good morning, princess. You are so pretty. You can go now, Dri. Let Risa take care of grandma. Until your mother finds another nurse. Yes, Aunty. I have to go to campus, anyway. Okay. Risa, please take care of grandma. Bye. -Thank you, Aunty. -Yes. Take care, Dri. Where is my room? Risa, come. I need to show you grandma's medications. Bye, Mom. -Bye, sweetheart. -Bye, Mom. Bye. Risa. Did you remind mom to call Aunt Tina? Of course. Alright. Be nice until the new nurse is here, okay? Okay! Risa, can I go ride my bicycle? Okay. But don't go of the compound. And be home before dawn. Okay! Let's play. What is that? Wait here. Let me comb your hair so you will be prettier. Time to eat, Grandma. She'll be home any minute, Grandma. Next time, you need to be home before dark, okay? Yes. It's okay now, Grandma. Ri... ...go and see who has come. Riri? What is your name, Ms.? I'm Riri. I'm Asih. Little child. Risa, this is Ms. Asih. Are you the new nurse? Great! I got a new friend. Come on, Ms. Asih. Ms. Asih, would you sleep with me? So I will not be afraid anymore. Ms. Asih? Ms. Asih? Ms. Asih? Ms. Asih? Ms. Risa. Risa, lets have breakfast. Did grandma have breakfast, yet? After you finish with Riri, please prepare porridge for grandma. Grandma. Grandma, this is Ms. Asih. If you need anything, just call her, okay? This is her schedule for medication. The medication needs to be taken in the morning, noon and night. Please try to make her take the medicines. One, two, three, four, five... ...six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Ms. Asih, are you hiding now? Riri? -Ms. Asih? -She's playing with Ms. Asih. Who is that? The new nurse from Aunty Tina. She did not tell me about that. Mom, I got to go. Grandma is calling. Grandma? What is it, grandma? What's wrong? What is it, grandma? Ms. Asih? What is it, grandma? Ms. Asih! What is it, grandma? What do you want? It's okay, grandma. It's okay. I'm here, okay? There, there. It's okay. It's okay, grandma. I'm here. Ri? Riri? Riri? Riri? Ms. Asih? Ms. Asih? Riri? Riri? Riri? What are you doing? Nothing. Ms. Asih, please sing that song again. What are you doing? You scared me! Why are you back? You don't need me here? Alright. I'll just go away. -Bye. -Seriously. Your mother called me. She asked me to look after you. She said not to let you do weird things. Shut up. I'm not weird. Ms. Asih, I'm sure that... ...you used to sing this song to your children. Riri? Riri... ...I'll take you to your room. Early in the morning on your laptop, just like a blogger, huh? People who can see ghosts? You're always obsessed with ghosts. Don't you like normal people? Humans irritate me. Like you. No way. I once read on the internet. In that article... ...said something on how to see ghosts. You just squat. Bend down, and look from between your legs. It doesn't make any sense, right? I've tried it, nothing happens. Where is Riri? Playing outside. Cool. You rarely play with her, don't you? She doesn't want to play with me either. Besides, she’s got Ms. Asih. Who? The new nurse from Aunty Tina, right? My Mom never told me about a new nurse. Go play with Riri. She's alone. Go on. Risa, Riri. You guys want some meatballs? Grandma? What's wrong, grandma? Grandma? Risa! Help me, Risa! Stop it, grandma. Get up. Oh my God! Grandma! What's the matter? Grab her. Come on, grab her. What is it, grandma? Calm down, grandma! What's wrong, Grandma? -Grandma? -Tell me, grandma! Grandma. What's the matter? -Please, calm down. -Calm down, grandma. What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? Risa said that we should not go out of the house. I am going back. Calm down, grandma. Riri? -Riri? -Riri? Riri! Riri? You search the house. I'll go look for her outside. Riri? Riri? Riri? Riri? Riri? Riri? Riri? Riri? Riri? Andri? Andri? Andri? Andri? Oh my God! Andri? Andri? Andri? Riri? Riri! Riri? Riri. Riri? Riri. Riri! -Hello. -Hello, Mom. She took Riri, mom. -I can't find her. -Taken? Taken by whom? Asih, mom. She's not human. Riri can see Asih, too. -What do you mean? -Help me, Mom. Oh, my God! I'll be right over. Wait for me. Listen to me, Risa, don't do anything. -Wait for me. -Please hurry, Mom. Peter. William. Janshen. I need you guys. Risa, you've grown up. Peter. William. Janshen. I missed you guys. You need to find Riri now. She's evil, Risa. She wants your sister. Your sister is not the first. Help me find Riri. Riri is not here. She has been taken to our world. You need to go there. How? Don't be afraid, Risa. We'll be with you. But, there you will see our true form. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Risa? Riri? Risa? Riri? Risa? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Ma'am? -Come with me. -Mother? -Ma'am? -Mother? Ma'am. Come with me. Riri? Riri! Riri! Riri, it's me, Risa. Wake up! Riri, please wake up. Riri, wake up. Let's go home. Riri, please wake up. This is Risa. Riri, wake up! Let's go home! Sweetheart. Come with me. Riri? No! No! Riri! Riri! Riri! Riri! Riri! Riri! Riri! Riri! Riri? Riri? Riri? Riri? You're a slut! Your child is a bastard. Ma'am... The big tree near the house. That's where she committed suicide. Put this comb into the ground. Ouch! Ouch! Riri! Riri. Riri. Riri. Riri? Risa? Riri? Risa? Mom? Mom! Risa. Riri. My kids. Riri? Riri? Risa. Riri. Riri? As I promised when I was a kid. Until this day, I still play with them. Risa. Mom is looking for you. We need to go now. Okay. Come on. Peter. William. Janshen. You guys are my friends forever. Done, Risa? Let's go, sweetheart. Let me comb your hair so you will be prettier.
