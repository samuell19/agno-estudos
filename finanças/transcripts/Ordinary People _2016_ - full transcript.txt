--== McEphie ==-- Call my mother. Mother. Le'ts go. Come on. Quickly. Carry the kid. Faster. Come on. Come on. Wait. Hold on. Jane! You won't stop crying. But when I feed you, -you don't suckle. -Jane. I don't know what to do with you. Jane. Aries asked me to find you. He's crazy. Tell him we're over. What are you fighting about? He's fucking crazy. He is bringing me back to my mom's. That's not my problem. You guys should talk. I'll tell Aries about you. Stop crying. I said, shut up. Should I throw you here? Stop crying. Please stop. Stop, that's it. Keep still. I said, stop it. Jane. There's an officer. Let's get going. Jane, I'm sorry. Jane. Aries, I'm not talking to you. I said I'm sorry. Where did you sleep? At Alma's, why are you even asking? I already said I'm sorry. I have a plan but you're still mad. How is that a plan? You're taking me back to my mom's. Nothing is wrong with it. I will visit you anyway. You don't have to. Just forgive me. Fuck off. -I'm really sorry. -You're smothering the baby. What are we calling him? Just as we agreed. Your name and mine combined. Let me hold him. Be careful. Be gentle. He looks like me. Come home with me. Look at how horny these two are. Hey, you horny asses. Why? Fuck you. Stop staring. Cut it out. I ruined their sweet moment. Envious bastards. Stop it, Aries. You keep fondling me. Your child will run out of milk. Stop. You're so horny. You're being fucking difficult. Son of a bitch. It stinks because you keep on pissing. Hey Aries, shut up. The baby's sleeping. That bastard was pissing around. Just lie down. Here, beside me. -You missed me? -I miss fucking you. -Wanna fuck? -Yes. Hold on. Faster. Make sure that's gonna hold. Baby Arjan might fall. Make sure it's evened out. Alma sent a message. They're handing out donations at the clinic. We're going to go there. Just go. -Oh no. -Oh no. Your kid is not fond of strangers. -What's his name? -John Derrick. Hi, John Derrick. -Okay, stop crying. -Don't get sick. I need to run, see you around. I'll be back. Bye. Jane, come over here. I texted you earlier. What took you so long? We had to walk quite a distance. Did you forgive Aries? We are good again. -Can I cut the line? -Stay here. You heard there's a wake for May's child? Where did they get money for a wake? From a city councilor. They even gave her more money. Hey, why did you let her cut in line? We got here first. Excuse me, no one cut in line. -You let her cut. -I did not. -We've been here all afternoon. -Thank you. What a fucker. -You think we didn't notice? -How annoying. Thank you. Stay here, Jane. That woman's full of crap. Shut up and just stay in line. Fuck you. You shut up. You're the one who cut in line. Can I just trade the rice and noodles for soap and shampoo? -Can't you cook where you're staying? -No, they'll send us away if we do. That's why I told you to move into our place instead. Alright, I'll see you later. -Bye. -Take care. This is my child, Baby Arjan. -Please give him your blessing. -How old is your kid? He's almost thirty days old, Father. Will you get him baptized soon? But my baby hasn't been registered yet. Not yet registered? Raising a child is not a business. He still has no birth certificate. We weren't able to get one from the city hall. Is that so? When you get one, bring him here so we can baptize him. Okay, Father. Aries. Here's our food. I waited in line for this. Wow. Hey, let us eat the food too. You wish. -Fucking greedy. -Bathe with us. -You stink. -Yeah. You fuck more often that you take baths. Shut up you piece of shit. Yoli, hold him while I bathe. Come on, Jane. You've got a stench already. Take a bath, Stinky. You need one badly. Aries. Aries. -Motherfucker. -Shit, you'll pay for that. Here, take a bath. Stop. You won't stop fooling around? That's my faucet. My water. Why are you mad again? That hurts. -You are getting me wet. -Come on, we rarely get to take a bath. -Fine, be quick. Then get out of here. -Okay. Come on, Jane. This doesn't happen often. Can I use a sponge? Just this once. Don't mind me. I still smell good. Let me use the sponge. Take a bath now. -Come on, Jane. -I'll scrub you myself. I don't want to. We'll have some coffee. Coffee please. And porridge too. Here's your coffee. Are you the mother? My condolences. -My condolences. -Thank you. -Have a seat. -Thank you. Why should the wake last for a month? Nida, that's how you'll earn money. Gambling is legal during the wake. Just think about it. I'll just be with my friends. How did the kid die? She was playing. Then she got hit by a car. -She lost a lot of blood. -Poor kid. Miss. Your bag's open. Oh no. -Are you missing anything? -Nope. But thank you. I have a question. Why do you have baby clothes? That's for my child. Kidding. No, I'm selling these. Wanna place an order? I have clothes in your baby's size. -By the way, I'm Ertha. -Jane. Hi Jane. Your baby's so cute. Are you going to buy anything from me? We don't have cash. I can give it on loan, Jane. You wanna do a loan? We won't be able to pay you. Jane, that's why you loan. So you'll have money. We can do it on our own terms. Unlike others. I won't harass you to pay. So? No, thank you. What's your husband's job? Here and there. He sidelines. You know what? I can also loan him a bike. You wanna get one for extra income? No thank you, ma'am. He might want a bike. Think about it, okay? Give it some thought. I'm usually just around here anyway. You might regret it. How about I just buy your baby? -For ten thousand pesos. -What? Just kidding. Well then. I need to get going. Take care, Jane. Coffee and porridge, please. Hello. This is my very ugly husband. He smells really bad. But I love him very much. Piece of shit, won't you please smile? This is our child, Arjan. So cute. Just like his mom. His name's Arjan. From our names. Jane and Aries. Stop it already. One more minute. What's the fucking rush? You can't even wait. Piece of shit. Let's take a photo. Take a bath first. -What an idiot. -Look at the camera. Why don't you hold the baby? Come on. Hurry up. Just one photo. Come on, it will be quick. -Here. -That's it. Smile. Show me some teeth. Just take it. -You have to smile first. -Hurry up, I'm tired. Enough. One more. Just one more shot. Aris, you piece of shit. -Fuck it. -Come on. One more please. -Just one more. -You're so perky. -Fine then. -Just the two of us. Ouch, shit. Come on, it's just a picture. Your baby's so cute. Of course. -How much is it? -Thirty pesos. So expensive. That's already at cost. Miss, please make an invitation -for a wedding or a debut? -A debut. -Here's my payment. -Pick a color that you want. Oh, it fell. This one is nice. Is this purple or violet? Alright. That one. -Where's my change, Miss? -Oh sorry, I forgot. -Pay attention. -How much? Look at what I've got bro. How much? 2,500. Cool phone. Hey, I'm selling a cell phone. -Let me see, Jane. -How much? -That's an old model. -Just buy it. How much are you selling this for? 1,500. I'm only paying a thousand, Jane. Come on, don't be a cheapskate on me. This one's new. -How about you? -1,500? Too steep. That's an old model. 1,000 and I'll take it. Don't fuck with me. Aren't we friends? Jane, I'll take it at 1,000. How about you? 1,500. Too expensive. Why so high? -Won't you sell it at 1,000? -But you're fucking loaded. I'll be okay with a thousand. Make it 1,500. Maybe with another phone. Come on, it's for my child. So we can buy milk, please. There are a lot of scratches. Fine, I'll take it. Just because I feel sorry for the kid. One thousand. I'll but it for one thousand. Come back again. Okay. Thanks. That's too expensive. Here. -I already set aside our share. -Dumped. -Hold on to this. -Rejected. -The fucker's here. -Get out. Just say yes. The fucker... -got rejected by a girl. -Shut up, piece of shit. -Rejected. -Just now baldy got rejected. -Fuck you, not my loss. -Because you don't have eyebrows. As if you're so handsome. -Baldy. -The girl's a prostitute. -Prostitute? -But you liked her? -I'll beat you up. -Hey. Cut that crap. This is 1,500. How is this? -I'll keep all of it? -Of course not. You wish. Three something. 375 each. Sounds good. I should get a bigger share. Fucking midget, are you crazy? Come down. -Keep still. -Messing with me? Can you handle me? What do you want? I'll take you down. You split this yourselves. Some swag you have. I'm getting 375 or I'll beat up your mother. Your mother? -Okay then. -Give me my 375. -No. -Come on. Maybe a hundred. Cut this crap. Here it is. -I won. -Piece of shit. -Fucking assholes. -Shut up, my baby's about to sleep. Stop running. You have ten pesos? -How much is this? -600 pesos. -Give me a discount. -Alright, 500. -Make it 300. -Lowest I can go is 500. -Fine, never mind. -The cradle over there's just 200. Check it out. Okay, I'll check it out. Aries, is it pretty on me? No, it's hideous. Buy it for me. We don't have more money. Is this it, miss? Here he comes. Let's go. -What took you so long? -Here. -Thanks. -Wow. Oh, how pretty. -Your baby's so pretty. -Thank you. How old is she? -A month old. -Just a month? Hello baby. What's her name? -Althea Nicole. -How posh. Althea Nicole. Are you always here? You live around here? Alright. -Miss, what should I call you? -I'm Joanna. -Joanna. -This is for Althea. -Thank you. -Be sure you remember me. Okay. I am Ertha. Bye then. Goodbye. Stay healthy little one. I'll be on my way. Jane. I didn't know you lived here. How are you? -Just fine. -Your husband? -Out at work. -Have you decided? You want to do a loan? I'm quite loaded. Oh no, I really can't. Do the loan, Jane. Don't worry about paying me back for now. Okay? If you're uneasy loaning cash, how about clothes for the baby? Diapers? Come on. You know somewhere near here? There's a supermarket nearby. But wait. No one's watching over my kid. Let's take him with us. Come on, let's go. Go ahead and choose, Jane. -Can we buy this? -Of course. -But it's expensive. -That's okay. Hey, Jane. Be careful. Let me hold the baby. Come, let me hold him. Slowly. Baby. At least nothing hit you. -Be careful, Jane. -Can we buy three? Buy a lot. Hi. Let's go. What else? Food supplies. Baby. Jane. Open the zipper on the side of my bag. Get the cash. Jane, we might run short of cash. I'll just withdraw money outside. I'll be quick. It's 259.60 pesos. Miss, my payment. I'll just look for my companion. -Do you remember what she's wearing? -Yes. She's wearing a red top. And pants. Go look around. She's around somewhere. Miss, did you notice a transsexual? She's tall and wearing a red shirt and pants. A transsexual. Mister, did you notice a transsexual holding a baby? I did not see anyone. Miss, did you see a transsexual carrying a baby around? Miss, did you see a transsexual carrying a baby around? Look. Miss, I didn't see one. Sorry, excuse me. Miss, did you see a transsexual? She's carrying around this baby. No. Why? Where? Who's this transsexual? She stole my baby. I didn't see one, while I was selling. I haven't sold anything today. And they're getting rid of me. You'd better just pray. Stop worrying. -Thank you then. -You take care. Miss, excuse me. -You know where Felix Street is? -I have no idea. We've been lost for a while now. You might know. I have no idea. Miss, are you alright? I said I have no idea. Thank you then. Mister, let's just go. Hello, Aries. I'm at the supermarket. I went with this transsexual. I got distracted. Then the transsexual took him. He was taken from me. Yes. The transsexual stole Baby Arjan. Hurry. Come here. Let's look for him. Yes, come here now. Hurry up. Okay. What happened? Why are you even here? -The transsexual took him. -Where's Arjan? Who's this transsexual? Ertha, I really don't know. I was hypnotized. -Fuck, what happened? -Hey, look for a transsexual in red. -What happened? -Arjan got stolen. Just look for them. Shit, hurry. Let's go. -You're fucking stupid. -I'm sorry. My baby. Can I ask something? Did you see a transsexual carrying a baby? -I didn't see one. -You did not. Jane. Come on. Bro, did you see a transsexual carrying a baby? Miss, did you see a transsexual carrying a baby? This is his photo. Miss, did you notice a transsexual? -A baby. -No. Did you notice a transsexual with a baby? -A transsexual? -This is the baby. Wearing red? Did you see him? Thank you. Did you find her? -You saw her? -No. Still nothing. We already roamed around. Okay. This time you go there -while we go here. -Find her. -Let's find her. -See you later. Ma'am, you might have seen a baby. -A transsexual carrying a baby around. -Why? Our baby is missing. She lost him. -Yes. He was stolen. -At the supermarket. -Here? -Yes. -Oh my God. -Please help us, ma'am. -Maybe you can help us out. -Please help us. Okay, I'll file a complaint with you. Come on. -Where was he stolen? -Inside. Oh God, we'd better hurry. -You're sure you lost him inside? -Yes. Sir, I really couldn't find them. We can't do anything. We're not liable for that. Why not do something? The baby was stolen on your premises. It's your responsibility. Okay, ma'am. If you want, we can file a report at the office. Okay. Please don't ignore them just because of how they look. I'm just in a hurry. But you should go with that guard. Here little girl. A little help. Guard, please assist them. -Cordero. -Thank you. I'll just take them to the office. Is he with you? Yes, he's my husband. Why did you let a stranger hold your kid? I thought you actually knew that guy. Just because he's gay doesn't mean he's a good man. Rewind it a bit further. Is that her, Miss? Yes, that's her. Sir, do you know this guy? No, sir. But your girlfriend knows her. Look, she bought you groceries. Because she promised to buy diapers for the baby. I see. She left and you didn't stop her. She said we were short of cash. She had to withdraw some. I told you to follow her. Did you run after her? Yes, but I couldn't find her. Sir, here's what they purchased. There you go. Seems like all diapers. How old is the baby? Almost thirty days. Wow, the wound on his navel's still fresh. It's still open. I have another question. Where did you give birth? At the clinic. Jane. Let's just go home. Jane, we're so far from home. They're just around here. I'm tired. Let's try again tomorrow. Come, let's rest. I don't want to, Aries. I'm not going home without Baby Arjan. Aren't you tired? Jane. Let's try tomorrow, Jane. This is where the transsexual went. Shit. Where the hell are you going? -She's got to be here Aries. -Where can we find her? They came here, I'm sure. -Jane. -They're just around here. Come on, it's late. Fuck you! Why aren't you helping me? This is your fault. If you weren't so fucking stupid. Shit, we should be sleeping by now. I said stop. Ouch. Aren't you exhausted? Dumbass. Look, you're lactating. Aries, where's Baby Arjan? He's probably crying. Are they even feeding him? Do they have milk? This is all your fault. You're so stupid. -Fuck you. -Such a fool. Are you crazy? You're blaming me? We just lost our baby. If you didn't go with her we'd still have our baby. Fuck you. I'm so tired of you being an idiot. That's what you get. Fucking midget. Don't let him go. Then we went to the fucking supermarket. We were there to buy some stupid diapers. She left to withdraw money but never returned. That's it, you were scammed. Shit, it was like I was hypnotized. That's why you'd do whatever she said. I don't think so. Maybe you just sold your child, Jane. Fuck, you're such a prick. Shut the fuck up. So where's the cash? You idiot! Look at these groceries. Fuck you, I would never sell my child. -Fucking assholes. -Fuck you. It's probably true. Hey, stop it. Even my mom sold one of my siblings. Son of a bitch. Motherfuckers. You're a son of a bitch. Fuck you. Bunch of assholes. Fuck off. Don't mind them. This is perfect, we have food. Jane, I'll wait for you here. The police might recognize me. They might just arrest me when they see me. Fine, I'll just do it myself. Be quick. It's Jane Ordinaryo. What's your complaint? My baby was stolen this morning. Follow me. Jane. Did you get arrested? No. You're still in jail? My happy days are over. I'm 18 now. What's worse is, they arrested me for murder. I'll probably rot here. So I have advice for you and Aries. While you're still young, be stupid and foolish. Miss. What's her case? Her baby was snatched, Chief. Is that so? Miss, have a seat. Check these photos of people suspected of baby snatching. You're so young. You already have a baby? When did you lose your virginity? I'm sorry? When was your first fuck? Hey. When you're asked, answer. Bear in mind, we're helping you. When was your first fuck? When I was fourteen. Was your husband your first? No. You were a prostitute? No, sir. I don't believe you. Who was your first fuck? Answer me. Who was your first fuck? My mom's boyfriend at the time. What a flirt. Was it good? You seduced him? No. The culprit's not in the file. How old is your baby? Almost thirty days. Do you breastfeed your baby? Let me see. Show me how you breastfeed your baby. What? Sir, the culprit isn't here either. I'll be on my way. How will we find the infant if you don't cooperate? Sit down. Now what? How do you do it? Come on. Do it. Lift your shirt. Show me. Whenever he cries, I sing to him. Like this. Then, I shove my nipple into his mouth. Then I sing a lullaby. -What did they say? -They'll help us. Let's go home. Why are you fucking clumsy? Put it back on. I'll fix it later. -Jennifer, is your mother home? -Yes. Tell her we're here. -Mom. -Come inside. -Mom. -Over here. Madam Captain, we need your help. What's wrong? By the way, this is Aries and Jane. Asking if we could help. They look familiar. How can I help? Their baby was stolen. You have a kid? Are your parents aware of this? Whose children are these? Madam Captain, they're from... Shit, Jerry. That's why they look familiar. Look at them, don't you feel sorry for them? Jennifer, look at these kids. They're just about your age. -Jerry, call Social Welfare tomorrow. -Yes, ma'am. For temporary shelter. Madam Captain, we'd rather not. The people are like prisoners there. It will be temporary. Think of it as assistance. Don't worry, we'll help you. Tomorrow, we'll take you to the radio station. Ask for help from the public. Be grateful for Madam Captain's kindness. You're getting temporary shelter. We'll get going now. That's all for now, thank you. Alright then. -Thank you, Madam Captain. -It's nothing. Be careful. Yes ma'am. -Thank you. -Take care. Do that tomorrow. I'll take care of it. Hello? Hello Sarah, yes. I'm with two street children. Madam Captain's asking for your help. They're married. Their child got stolen. I'll bring them to the radio station. Hey. -Mister, we're hitching. -We'll just hitch. Is the radio station open? Just come back tomorrow. Public announcements are only until 9pm. Can't we do it now, mister? Sorry, it's midnight. -Thank you. -Alright. Le't try early tomorrow. Let's go home. Let's stay here until the morning. Get some cardboard from over there. Hurry. Let's get some rest. Gosh, partner. I feel really sorry for our guests today. So depressing. Partner, when you told me they were married, I couldn't believe it. At a very young age, Jane and Aries are already parents. -Yeah. -Dear listeners, if you could only see how young our guests in the studio are. How old are you? I'm 17, Jane is 16. Jane, how old is your child? Almost thirty days old. My God! -That's shocking. -Really. For those who just tuned in: We have Jane and Aries Ordinaryo with a public announcement. Yesterday, while Jane was at the grocery store, her friend took her child. Jane, you really had no idea that she was taking your child away? How was your baby stolen? When she first approached me, she convinced me to do a loan. I knew I couldn't pay her back. But she insisted so I eventually agreed. -Agreed to what? -Partner, I'll explain for Jane. We had a quick chat a while ago. And she told me about Ertha, her so-called friend. They've met twice. And on both occasions, she tried to persuade her to do a loan. Knowing that Jane had no means, being a street child. Of course, she needs money. Children are the targets. Exactly. The scheme is to feign a loan. -I just had that thought, partner. -What? Jane said her child's just about thirty days old. Right. Don't all infants look alike at that age? But it's possible, Partner. You see, I'm a mother as well. And some things are just instinctive. These instincts, how reliable are they, partner? It's maternal instinct. You just know! Jane, what if 20 infants were lined up in front of you, would you recognize your child? Yes. Of course, I have an attachment to my baby. Does he have a mole or a birthmark? No. But if I saw him, I'd know it was him. It seems to me, partner, that these two are searching for a needle in a haystack. Right. And while they search for a needle in a haystack, let's go find ourselves some work. Partners will be back. -Partners. -Partners. Oh, she's here. Ma'am, Nica's here. -Hello. -Hi! How are you? -Hello. -Wow, so sexy. Looks like the rumors about you aren't true. -Yeah. -Of course not. Come, have a seat. Let's talk about those rumors. I'm excited. We're done with them. You can leave now. -It's over. -Please step out with me. So Nica, I heard you were on vacation. Where did you go? I went around and it was beautiful. Wow Paris. Did you get us anything? For how long? Fucking shit. Jane, Aries. Ms. Abby Castañeda wants to interview you. I gave her your contact number and address. The hosts want to give a little something. -Please sign for formality? -What? Sign your name. -Where? -Over here. Not there. Here. Please sign this one too. Over here. That should be fine. Thanks. I hope you find your child soon. -Thank you. -I'd better go. Jane, a lot of strangers have sent messages claiming they know where our baby is. Who are we gonna believe? What happened, sir? We don't know where it came from. -Why did it explode? -We don't know yet. Hello? Yes. Seriously? For real? Okay, we'll meet you there. Where are you? Okay. Who was that? Ertha's mom. -Really? -Yeah. What did she say? She'll help us get our baby back. -Let's go meet her. -Come on. Let's go. Hello, where exactly are you? There she is. Are you Jane and Aries? I'm Jane, he's Aries. Jane, I'm really sorry. When I heard you mentioned Ertha, I knew you meant my child. Hold on. Here's a photo. Look. -Isn't that her? -Yes, this is her. Jane, I apologize on behalf of my child. I'm sure she's just in Surigao. I know my child. I'll help you get your child back. But don't file any police reports. Of course. As long as we get our baby back, we won't say a word to the police. Deep inside, Bong's a good person. Who's Bong? Ertha. I meant Ertha. Ertha listens to me. I understand how you feel because I'm a mother myself. Thank you. What if she's already sold our kid? Then I'll find out the address and inform you immediately. But we have a problem— I need money for the fare. Around... 10,000 pesos. -For fare and food. -We don't have the means for that much. How are we gonna retrieve your child then? Alright, we'll find a way. Okay then. Jane, I'd better get going. Send me a message when you've got the cash. -Okay. -The cash is important too. I need it for my fare and food. Okay then, I will not fail you. We'll get your child back. Just make sure about the cash. We need 10,000. 10,000? -That's a lot. -Where can we get 10,000? Do you believe her? I do, Aries. She has Ertha's photo. She's the mother. Stupid. She's just like her child. She's scamming us. What if she's not, Aries? What if she's telling the truth? You figure it out then. How can we make 10,000? You steal it. Do you know how much that is? Steal from everyone who crosses your path. Fuck you, it's not that easy. But I wanna see our baby again. Shit! Do I look like a thief? Macmac. You're heavy. You're doing errands now? Remember me? Let's go to mom. Give that to mom. Shit, what took you so long? For just one stick. Cess! Why are you here? Bert, tell Iking to hold his sessions here. We're safe again. -No more raids. -I'll tell him. -Mom. -What? Why are you here? My child was stolen from me. Just yesterday, at the supermarket. That son of a bitch was a fucking baby snatcher. Just today, the snatcher's mother contacted us. She's asking for 10,000. Where can we get that amount? Hey Jane, you know that I'm also broke. Don't they know we're dirt poor? What's your husband doing? He's finding a way. Looking for cash. He should've done that when you were giving birth. Did he look for cash when his baby was coming out? Didn't you end up asking for my help? I don't know. The only thing he spent on you was his cum. Stop nagging. If you can give me some money. Your baby's gone. Sold somewhere. And I'm sure your baby's with some rich dude. Only rich people get to buy other people. If I were you, I'd just imagine my child living the good life. Just make another baby. Fuck off. Piece of shit. You're pathetic. Annoying motherfucker. What a useless mother. Bullshit. Don't you come back just to ask for money. Bitch. Worthless piece of shit. Fuck this life. Thief. -This guy's a thief. -You thief. Take him to the station. Fuck you, I can't go to jail. -Not going to jail? -This is for you. Bastard. You're not going anywhere. Son of a bitch. Let's go to the police. To the precinct. -To the police station. -Let's go. Fuck. Piece of shit. You took my phone. Beat that bastard. -Miss. -Where's my money? Where's my purse? Fuck you. Dumbass. What an idiot. What now? Give me my phone. Everything I have is in there. -I'm sorry, miss. -I worked hard for that, motherfucker. You're saying sorry? Sorry is not accepted from thieves. Don't touch me. Motherfucker. Wait, where are you going? Run after him. Come on. Do you realize that this isn't enough? This is just 3,000 pesos. Fuck you. I almost got caught earlier. Go to hell. You're such a selfish prick. -Shit. How's our baby? -Go steal yourself. Okay then. Piece of shit. Asshole. Hey handsome! Handsome! Hey. Any plans tonight? -What? -What are you doing tonight? You tell me. How much? -Your call. -Get inside. I can only afford 200 pesos. Aries! Hurry up. Faster. Such a slowpoke. This won't suffice. Anyway, I'll just make do. I'd better go. I'll purchase a ferry ticket. I'll keep you updated. Do you want us to come along? I'm taking a ferry. Can you pay for your fare? What you gave me isn't even enough. I'll just make do. If I knew... hold on. Do you doubt me? Gosh, if only I knew then I wouldn't have come here. I spent my own money. If you don't trust me, take your money. I'm the one giving a helping hand and you're thinking ill of me. Shut up, Aries. Miss. Please take this. Please update us. Okay. -Just wait for my message. -Okay. What do we do now? Miss Abby, this is the place. We're here. Jane. Where's Aries? He's over here. Hi Aries! This is Miss Abby. This is Jane and Aries. Jane, can we interview you? A feature on your life. Fine with me. Will we get paid for it? We'll feed you. Okay then. Fine. Later. Jane, before we begin, do you have photos of Baby Arjan? Yes. Aries, get the photos. Take care of these. We only have three. Our only photos of Baby Arjan. No problem, he's so cute! Of course, he got that from me. He looks more like me! Please set these aside. Marc, wire them up. Ma'am, I'll just put the mic on. Where are my questions? -What is this? -A microphone. Where do I place it? On your shirt. Oh no! Put it under your shirt. Just stick it on. Please speak to test the mic. -What should I say? -Oh, that's fine. How about you, sir? -It's here. -Good. -Miss Abby, we're ready. -Alright. Let's begin with your love story. Where did you meet? On the streets. You were also very excited. Aries, did you like Jane immediately? Not at first. But now, I do. Then they had a child. How was your child snatched? A gay man approached me. Asked me if I wanted a loan. I was stupid, I tagged along. -I really don't know. -Who's that transsexual? Why'd you let him hold the baby? You're so gullible. Show some sympathy. Help us find our child. If you know Arjan's whereabouts, you may call this number. Why aren't we part of your story? Aren't friends part of the story? -Hey, support me on this! -He's right. Damn, you have really miserable lives. But... you look so different from those actors. Dumbass! Hit me again and I'll beat you up. -Who else would play them? -Aries, we got messages. A lot. You're damn popular now, Jane. -Stupid! -They say: "You shouldn't have kids! Useless parents. Good thing the kid's with someone else." Bullshit. Asshole. "Quit looking for the kid!" Here's another. They even said: "If you weren't so stupid, you wouldn't have lost him. Unfit parents!" Let's beat up her kid. Stop reading. Let's just go. I'll kill them for you. You're brave now? Hello, Miss Abby. We're fine. Oh, Miss Abby. Can we have our baby's photos? Got lost? What? -Stupid reporters! -Okay then. Thanks. -She said what? -So stupid. We also lost Arjan's photos? Motherfucker! Bad luck strikes again. Aries! Jane! They're beating up a transsexual on the corner. Shit, that might be the one who got your kid. -Let's go. Let's check it out. -Hurry. Jane, that's not Ertha! I saw you took her child! -Fuck you! -Jane, that's not Ertha! I saw you! You can't escape. I'm sure it was you. You're evil! Fuck you! I saw you! -What are you doing? -Give that to me. Why do you care? -Why do you care! -You're killing the baby! What's going on here? Get off of my turf. -You want some? -It's not your problem! -We're sorry, boss. -You want some? Got a problem? -Get out of here. -The baby will die! I'm gonna hit you. -You? -Motherfuckers! Asshole, you're killing the child! It's so fucking good fucking you. Jane, let's just replace Baby Arjan. Piece of shit. You're really useless! Aries, someone sent a message. I know where they took Baby Arjan. He was sold to Elsa Duque, who lives at this address. Look. Don't believe it, Jane. Must be a scam just like Helen. What if it's not? What if they really want to help us? Up to you. Let's go to them. Jane, are you sure this is the way? -Gosh, their place is so far. -Yes. You sure they're not duping us? No. How about you? Are you sure this is not just a prank? Hey, are you coming? Baby Arjan was sold too far away. If no one had told us he was here maybe we'd never see him again. Jane, what if the baby's doing fine? In a nice house with lots of diapers, with milk, and all the things we couldn't give him. Will we still take him back? Of course, we're his parents. Don't you want a better life for our child? Even if they feed him expensive milk. Even if they wrap him in golden diapers. My baby won't be their baby. The houses here are huge. Look at those houses. Will we ever get to live in a place like this? We're here. This is it. Saint Alexandra. Let's go! Very beautiful. I want that house. That black and white one. Miss, where are you headed? We're going to one of the houses. Aries, hand me the phone. Here it is. Yes, that's here. You need to get a gate pass. Ben. -You have an ID? -No, sir. We don't have IDs. We can't let you in. -Are you guests of Ms. Duque? -Yes. Just a moment. Hello, ma'am. Are you expecting visitors? -What are your names? -Jane and Aries, sir. Jane and Aries, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Alright. Ms. Duque didn't mention any visitors. How's that? Sir, that's what the message said. We're supposed to be here. We can't let you in. I'm sorry. Please, sir. -We really can't. -We're very tired. If we weren't advised, we can't let you in. -We traveled so far. -Please, sir. It's been a long way. We'll be reprimanded if we let you in. -Come on, sir. -We really can't. -Thank you anyway. -Alright. Sir, please. Let it go. So mean and strict. Why is that? -Do you know them? -No. Maybe we can... I don't know anymore. There must be another way in. Be on the lookout for a way in. -Here. -That's what I'm talking about. -Let's go. -Hold on. Why? Just wait. Go ahead. Just wait for me here, Jane. -What? -Just wait here. -Be quick, okay! -I will. Duque Residence. Hello? Yes, ma'am. Done with his milk, he's asleep. There's beef, pork, and veggies in the fridge. Should I cook? Alright. -I watched AlDub Nation live. -Really? At Araneta. Araneta? Thought it was at Philippine Arena. Oh yeah, I forgot. -It's like you didn't watch. -So much fun. Alden is so handsome. Wish you'd been with me. Look, it's Peter. Let's join them? -Let's join him? -Come on. -They're having snacks. -They're not working. The house is almost done. Hello, Peter. Hey, you're almost done with the house. That's true. You might stop visiting. Jane, the baby's here. -Is it Baby Arjan? -Yes. -Let me see. -Hold on. -Don't rush. -Be gentle with the head. Hold on, down this side. Now, move faster. Come on, hurry up. What? Aries, this is not my child. That's Arjan. It's not our baby. This is not my child. I know what my son looks like. Would they've told us if this weren't our kid? Look, they just duped us. We were fooled. I know my child's face, Aries. -Let's just go. -Asshole, you better return him. -Are you stupid? -If I give him back, I'll be caught, moron. I don't care, just take the kid home. Son of a bitch! Please return him, Aries. Have mercy. Think of the child. Take him back. Let's stop searching, we won't find Arjan. Let's just take care of him. Give him to me, I'll return him myself. Well fuck you, take him. Get lost. Fuck off. -Don't return the kid. -Asshole. -Heartless prick. -You're stupid. Sorry, baby. -I'll take you home, stop crying. -Fuck you, Jane. Hey, let's just not. Sure? Make up your mind. You might fall. Give me the baby. Careful, it might fall. Go ahead. I'll hold on to it. Here. Hey. Aries, where is the house? -Over there. -Where? There. I'll return him myself. No, I'll do it. -Let me. -I'm sorry, baby. You're almost home. Sorry. I'll return the baby myself. They know that the baby's gone. What about the other houses? We need to double the security. Such a big village. There aren't enough security guards. -Stay at the exits. -The baby. The baby's there. -Baby. -Don't move. Thieves! Hurry up, let's go.
