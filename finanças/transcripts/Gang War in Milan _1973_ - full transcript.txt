GANGWAR IN MILAN Good morning, Mr. Cangemi! Always up first thing, eh? And you're always late, aren't you, Patrizio? But my watch is one minute to seven! Come on. Open up. I want to take a nice long swim. Bring me coffee and a croissant. It will be ready in 5 minutes! I'll see to it, Mr. Cangemi! Marisa! You're smart as ever! Good morning. Mr. Cangemi! Mr. Cangemi... With that little body of yours you could have jewelry, furs and a more luxurious apartment than Liz Taylor. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Oh, sure you do! You always like to kid around! Where would you like your breakfast, at the pool or in the locker room? Bring it to me in the locker room, OK? Marisa! Patrizio! What's happened? Oh, my God. Call Dr. Vannone, quick! Easy now, lay her down. Do you know her? Me? No, but she must have died a horrible death! She was murdered. Are you sure? No doubt about it. You can see on her neck the marks of the hands that held her underwater. Poor girl! She was so pretty! - What's that, doctor? - Seaweed. Seaweed? Saltwater algae. This girl was drowned in the sea and not more than 2 hours ago. Rigor mortis has not even begun to set in yet. Call the police. Lino? This is Totò. Listen, someone whacked Francesca! They fxed it so I found her drowned in the pool at the Skorpion! Yes. Tell our 'friends'. She was the top girl in my organization! My star! She brought in more than half a million lire a day! Not even the Queen of Holland makes that much! - Who could have done it? - I don't know, Ricciolino. But one thing I do know: that murder was intended as some kind of snub to me! Are you sure? Do you have your head up your ass? How can you not see it? Think about it! Francesca was my top girl. Why should they throw her into the pool at the Skorpion after having drowned her God knows where? Because they know I am the first one in at that pool every morning! And she will be waiting for me blonde and lovely! - That's what they wanted! - Exactly! But whoever did it is going to pay! I'm going to suck the blood out of this worm one drop at a time! I swear as God's my witness! I don't know who would have done a thing like this to you. A thousand guys would have wanted to! Like that bastard Mimmo Pelagonia or Turiddu Colosimo... ...or that American I cleaned out at chemin de fer. But instead of talking our heads off, we have to take action! Take actions like cops! Actually, better than cops because we can use any means to reach our aim! There's still one thing I don't get. The club's doctor said that Francesca was drowned in the sea - about two hours before 7 o'clock. - Right. But even if they had killed her at 5 o'clock, how did they manage to get her from Genoa to Milan in less than 2 hours? Genoa! Nobody's ever mentioned Genoa! Genoa is the nearest town on the sea to Milan... ...or maybe you prefer Venice, which is farther away? - Caruso is right! - Maybe the doctor is wrong. No, he isn't wrong! Last night Francesca called me at 3.30 to ask me if she could go out for a glass of champagne with a client. And I said that she could. That means she was still in Milan at 3.30. It seems a real mystery to me. - Which apartment is Miss Vannaccina's? - It's on 5th floor. - Good morning. - Good morning. I'm commissioner Contalvi. I have a search warrant. Holy Mary! Come in! Make yourselves comfortable. - What's your name? - Carmela. Carmela Crescimbene. I'm the housekeeper. Poor girl! Poor girl! So you already know of Miss Vannaccina's death? Yes, sir. How did you come to hear the news? Just a short while ago, two men arrived... ...and they told me that Miss Francesca was dead. I had never seen them before... ...but they barged right in and started searching everywhere! - You don't know who they were? - No, sir. You see what a mess they made. Did they tell you what they were looking for? - No. - How can that be? They just appeared out of nowhere! They scared me half to death! The front door was open? No! The door was locked, but they must have had the key! PRODUCE MARKET Come on! Let's get to work! Or are you on strike? - Good morning. - Hello. Hey! What are you doing? Get to work! You have to keep them always on their toes! Good morning. - Good morning, Mr. Cangemi. - Thank you! Mr. Balsamo and his cousin are waiting to see you. Fine. Show them in. Excuse me, just one quick signature. Fine. - There we are! - Thank you. Oh, my darling... To hell with your enemies! Cheers, Lino! Totò, my dear friend! Lino Caruso! Nice to see you both! - Hi, Balsamo! - Hello. - This is my cousin. - What's your name? - Take that thing off. - Virginia, sir. Let's drop formalities! We're in Milan, not in Sicily anymore! We're democratic here! Listen, sweetheart... ...your name is Virginia, but you aren't a virgin, are you? I have a six-year-old daughter. A policeman stole my virginity when I was 16. Listen, do you want to work? And you know what it's all about, don't you? Sure, I have to be a whore, at 10,000 lire a shot. Lift up your skirt. Let's see what you've got. Come on! Up, up, come on. She's crazy! You really go around like that? Why? I bathed this morning... - But you dress like an old lady! - She's a quick learner, Totò! Her tits. Let me see her tits. Your boobs! Come on! - Here? In front of everyone? - Get on with it! - Get that bit of rag off her! - Come on! Here, put this on. But... ...it's torn. There are two big holes in it. Those aren't holes, stupid. This is high quality French lingerie! The holes are supposed to show off the nipples. Get it? You'll see, my little Virginia, I'll make you a star. Salvatore Cangemi. What the hell is this? Good evening, my friend. Are you fine? I regret having to entry your house in this strange way but I had no other choice. Who are you? He's ok, Captain. Would you mind telling me who you are and what the hell you want? My name is Daverty... ...Roger Daverty, but I'm known as "The Captain". I assume you've already heard of me. And you broke in on my house just to tell me this? No. I thought we could do business: work together as partners. You have a vast network of prostitutes on the streets and in apartments. And I could provide you with 'snow'. What could you provide me with? Snow. Pure heroin. I can bring in as much as I want from France. It's very rewarding. - Is it a deal? - I get it. You want to use my girls to peddle your drugs. Is that it, Frenchy? Yes, 30% for you and 70% for me. I think it's a generous proposal. Oh, sure! Very generous! It makes one go "cazzicatummoli"! Pardon me? Oh yeah, you aren't Sicilian. That must be why you're playing with fire. Listen to me, captain or general. I'll give you a little advice as a friend. If you leave quietly, I'll forget everything that just happened. Are you suggesting that my proposal doesn't interest you? That's it! You're making a mistake, my friend. After all, some of your girls have already worked for me... ...for example, the blond. What was her name? Francesca. You are kidding! I don't joke about business affairs. So it was you who whacked Francesca! She didn't want to stick to the deal. Pity, because she had many qualities. You'll soon see that I did you a big favor. You have three days to consider my proposal. If you want to find me, come to the Tortue Rouge. Recorded in this tape machine is a declaration of Francesca against you. Of course, I have the original. Oh, I almost forgot... I've hidden a sizable dose of drugs in your apartment. Don't bother to look for it. In case you refuse, you'll go to jail for peddling narcotics. Bye bye, my friend. Now I'll have my little joke! "Cornuto"! Ah, you mean 'cuckold'. But I'm not married. My name is Francesca Vannaccina. I'm 26 and I'm a photographic model. I was forced onto the streets by a certain Salvatore Cangemi. He is the boss of all the prostitution in Milan. The past few years I turned over to him about 50 million lire in that he forced me to go to bed with the most disgusting men... Look, it's Clelia, Francesca's best friend! She's trying to pull one over on us too! Taxi! Are you sure it's really necessary? Don't make trouble, darling. Piazza del Duomo! Fast! Where is he taking her? Into the subway? Let's go! It's open! Everything's ready. You have an idea what's going on? Lino! That's sea water! You're right! So this must be where Francesca was drowned! Before dumping her into the pool at the Skorpion. I don't want to go on with it, Martin. I'm scared. Scared of what? Everything's gone fine up until now. That's what I mean! I want us to part on good terms. Clelia, it's too late to turn back now. You get me? Why? Is it my fault if I'm afraid? OK, darling. I don't want anyone to think I've been forced. Let's go. Goodbye, Giorgio. Don't shoot, Lino! Hey! Wake up! You were almost a goner! You bitch! I should have let you die! What does the French gang use the aquarium for? They drop a load of drugs off here each night... - ...and we come here to get it. - Where? Under that water tank there. Flush it down the john! Hurry up! POLICE HEADQUARTERS Good morning. I'll be right with you, Mr. Cangemi. He used to be a fine lawyer our President! I have the utmost respect for true legal eagles. You wanted to talk to me, commissioner? You're a wholesale dealer, right? Yes. "Verziere Siculo, Ltd". And without boasting, we supply half of Milan with the best vegetables and fruit from Sicily. Were you well acquainted with a certain Francesca Vannaccina? Poor girl! It was a terrible shock to me. Commissioner, speaking from man to man, I have no problem in confessing that to you: for a while I was crazy about Francesca. Mr. Cangemi, we are perfectly well aware of your real activity! Miss Vannaccina worked for your network of prostitutes. You exploited her and, according to the law, this is... No, commissioner, now you're beginning to get insulting. - I'd better call my lawyer. - That won't be necessary. Until such time as we are able to lay our hands on proof positive, you'll remain an honest dealer. I'd be careful though. Do you have any more questions to ask me? Nothing else for the moment. Oh, I almost forgot... If you should happen to hear anything about drugs, give me a call. Drugs? Who knows anything about drugs, commissioner? I'll take note of what you say, Mr. Cangemi. Goodbye. Go ahead! Eat up! You're worse than that half-starved cop! Maybe those French pigs were just having a little joke. Those guys are not the type, Lupo! Keep looking! Hey, boys! I found it! Pretty smart, that French guy! Good work! GANG WAR IN MILAN. SHOWDOWN IN THE SUBWAY. - Any news on the Sicilians? - No, Captain. - Tell Takis that he can get started. - OK. Come on, warm yourself up! You need it! - How about a pizza? - I'd love one! Well, what are you waiting for? Let's go! - I need to go get my hair fixed. - Me too, but who has the time? Hey, girls! The cops! You guys are always busting our balls! Just drop dead! You're all crazy, that's what you are! Let me go! Come on! Let's go! You lout, who do you think you are? Come on, gorgeous, move it! Get in there! I have kids at home! Are you kidding? It's not against the law! Keep your hands off me! Never seen such a thing! I can go there myself! What do you want from me, jerk? Listen to me, officer, please! I have two kids waiting for me at home! What about me? I have a baby who needs to be nursed every 3 hours. - What's going on? - The cops! - Come on! Get a move on! - Hey! Hands off! Alright, come on! Everyone in! They passed a law in the Italian Parliament, so they should treat us ladies with a little more respect! Yeah, they really stuck it to us this time! Right up the ass! - Shut the hell up! - Where did they find this guy? In the circus? There's a lawyer called Samperi to see you, sir. Show him in. Good evening, commissioner. I am Mr. Samperi. I represent some the humble working women who a short while ago were arrested by the police while entertaining some acquaintances... who just came along. Are you talking about whores? Come to the point! I wish to protest against this prosecution on the part of the police which so obviously goes against the spirit of the Merlin Law! What are you talking about? The police have made no arrest of prostitutes tonight! Where the hell are we? We don't have all day! Come on! Let's go, sweetheart! Move it! Come on! Come on! Get out! Let's go! - Where are you taking us now? - Get going, lady! - You too! - Fuck you, son of a bitch! - I have two kids, I told you! - Shut up and get moving! Whoever planned that roundup organized it very well. I've heard enough from you! Yes? Hello? Was it you, Frenchy? Just a little joke, my friend. A joke that will cost you, according to my calculations, about 8 million lire. You want to ruin me, don't you? I can keep those girls of yours for a week or a month. Just think how much you'd lose. I might even ship them off to the brothels of Saudi Arabia. Is it really worth it, my friend? What do you want? To make you richer. That's all. Well, your three days are over. Alright, I'm willing to make a deal with you. Oh, good! I'm really happy for you. I find you are very nice after all. I'll expect you tomorrow night at the Tortue Rouge. Be sure to come! Hi, darling. There he is. Good evening, my friend. Did the girls arrive in good shape? They were treated very well. They almost thought they were on vacation. You kept your promise alright. Well then? Well, what's your offer? 30% for you and 70% for me, and I'm the boss. A fair deal is always fifty-fifty. You're an ambitious guy. You mean I'm not a sucker. 50%, think about it. Don't worry. We'll come to an agreement. What about eating together in a quiet little place one of these days? Very well, my friend. But not more than 30%. This is not how you treat a beautiful woman. Hold it. Thank you. Believe me, I really couldn't stand that guy any longer. That's what I figured. Hey, waiter! Champagne for everyone, but make sure it's the best! Can you give me a light? It's true. Violence is what I hate above all. I wouldn't say so by the way you treated my friend. Yes, but he spoke English and the English language gets on my nerves. Listen, why don't we go someplace else? There are too many people here. I hope you're not going to offer me a drink at your place. No. I just want to ask you a favor: I'd like to leave this place with you. Do you mind? An alibi? It could be. Shall I call you a taxi, sir? No, there's no need. I have my "600" parked outside. Here. Mercedes 600. Go get the car. Get going, boys! That lout wants war, I'll give him war. She is very peaceful. She spends most of her time in prayer. - How is her health? - It's pretty good. All our doctors keep an eye on her all the time. - Don't worry, Mr. Cangemi. - My son! Momma! - Momma! - Totò! My son! Wait there! Don't move! - I brought you some chocolates. - Thank you. What is it, Totò? You look pale and worn out. What you're talking about? You're crazy. What about you though? The director was telling me that... Yes, I have everything I need. This place is better than a palace. Then why do you say it so sadly? I miss Sicily. I'd like to go back to my village! Back to your village, with those peasants! This is where you should stay, where they treat you like a queen! But what about that friend you said you'd made here? Yes, Mrs. Vitale. She's such a dear. But she's going away. Her son can't afford to keep her here anymore. - How come? - Because his business is going very badly. He sells television sets. Where? Quite near Milan. Oh, yes. In Gallarate. Don't worry, momma. Your friend will not have to go away from here. You dirty Sicilian whore! You rat! Look out! Here are the French guys! Stop! You're beautiful! You're Vicky the student, aren't you? Now I'm going to give you a lesson! No! Stop it! No! Stop it, please! Look out, girls! Stop! Maria Antonia! Those bitches are listening to music instead of working! Holy shit! The boss has got to know about this right away! Go find him! - A little more dessert, sir? - No, thanks. Try Mr. Zuff here who doesn't have to worry about dieting. - Sir? - No, thanks. As I was saying about those import licenses, my friend Cangemi and I thought that... Don't worry! You'll have those licenses, provided that your friend Cangemi keeps his promise. Cangemi always keeps his promises, sir! We've obtained building permission. Your competitors have withdrawn. Happy? Good evening. I took it upon myself to make a few arrangements for your weekend ...as you can see. That's Vanessa... ...a real English purebred. Hilda Bormann is from Hamburg. And here we have my dear little Virginia. Good evening, sir. You quit that 'sir' crap. Well, it's getting late, but I'll be leaving you in good company. Have fun! Be good! - Goodbye, Cangemi! See you soon! - Goodbye. Come on over here, darling. - Hello. - How about a little kiss? I'll get out here. I want to take a little walk. Alone? What are you worried about? I can take care of myself. Good night. Hello? Hello, Jasmine? It's me, Salvatore Cangemi. How are you making out? I didn't realize we were close friends. We are now. Happy? Hello? Are you there? Can you hear me? It's almost 2 a. m. You must have something very importan t on your mind to call me at this hour. You bet your life. Thanks. Good night. How much is the Frenchman paying you? You bastards! Enough to teach you a lesson! - We're four against one! - You're in trouble, Sicilian scum! Let's get the hell out of here! The cops! Hey, you! Just a minute. Where are you going? He's my husband! - What happened? - He was attacked! A gang of thugs mugged me at knife point! They took off that way in a grey Mercedes. Thank you, sir. Don't mention it. We're just doing our job. Do you want to bring a charge? No. It's not worth the trouble. My briefcase had nothing of value in it. - Good night and thanks again. - Good night. Come on. Well, violence again in spite of your aversion. You're right. But what can I do about it? Anyhow, this time it was you who got me out of trouble. So now... we're quits. So now, what's your problem? I'm all ears. Don't worry. I'm not a lesbian or frigid, but I'm not one of your boulevard whores either! Who told you that? Do you think I come from Mars? Everyone in Milan knows who you are. They even talk about you over dinner at Biffi's. Listen up, sweetheart! You don't expect me to believe that you bought all this stuff on a department store clerk's salary... ...earning 70,000 lire a month. As for Mars, you see I don't live there either. What are you talking about? Jasmine Sanders. Born in London. Now aged 24. Married to a well-known homosexual peer who divorced her. Later companion to the famous 80 year-old oil tycoon Grant who mysteriously died 7 months ago while vacationing in Las Vegas. You were there together, weren't you? He had a weak heart, if you want to know. So do I. There's one difference though: his was 50 years older than mine. Alright, Sicily. Anyhow, I'm leaving for London tomorrow afternoon... ...and by the time I get back you are sure to be in jail. PRODUCE MARKET We can't go on like this, Totò. You were almost killed... ...and the girls are too terrified to work. - And what's worse is... - What's worse? Come on! Spit it out, Lino! I didn't want to tell you, but five of the girls left. Which ones? Definitely Vicky the student; Nympha; Stella and Venice... ...but probably Virginia too. Virginia? Are you out of your mind? Yeah, last night Nino Balsamo did some pretty strange talking. What did he say? Well, I ran into him by a chance and he asks "Are you satisfied with Virginia?" And I say, "We can't complain." And he says, "She's a goldmine..." "...too bad she's started getting these stupid ideas on her head." He explains to me that Virginia made plans to set up on her own, unless she gets double that we've been paying her. What are you hitting me for? What have I done? I just discovered you're intending to leave me and planning to start up on your own! Leave you? Why would I want to leave you? I'm well paid, get a nice house, I go around dressed like a princess. Who told you a thing like that? - Nino Balsamo! Your cousin! - Nino? Nino! That bastard! It's a lie! To begin with, he isn't my cousin! He is the one who stole my virginity! He is the father of my daughter! That bastard made me become a whore! How could you think that I would...? - He's a slenderer! - Of course! That son of a bitch! I give him 10,000 lire a day, and in return he beats me up! Look! He did that to me because he wanted more! And now he's convincing some of the girls to play along with the others! What others? He even proposed that to me. He says that the French gang pays better. And Vicky is one of these girls that have been told? Yes, her too. Nino said... What did he say? That Vicky is a smart girl... ...and that she's already working with the French guys. So Vicky's a smart girl, is she? Good girl, Vicky! You're phenomenal! Now let's see what you can do! Balsamo! You're out of luck today, eh? Hello, Lino. Get out of here. We'll send for you later. Your hand seems to be a bit shaky. By the way... the boss wants to see you. He's expecting you this evening about 11 at the old Trecento. See you. It was the 'caponata' or maybe the eggplants. Pour the wine. But next time at least say 'excuse me'! We're in Milan now, not in your backward village! Play it, buddy! Good evening everyone. My dear Balsamo! We've all been waiting for you! Come on, sit down! Thank you, Totò. Luigi! Bring something for my friend Balsamo! Hurry up! Would you like some pâté de foie gras? I know that French cuisine is your passion, Balsamo. No, thank you. I don't feel like eating. Well, then have a drink at least. Listen, Lino, I... There you are. It's Sicilian bitters, not poison. Music, maestro! No, please! What are you going to do? It's finished. Things are as they were before, but they are not going to stay like that for long. We lost a ton of money! You didn't lose a goddamn cent! If anyone lost money, it's me! But those bastards are going to pay! Word of Cangemi! Totò, we can't get out the machine guns. We aren't in New York. And what are you proposing? We need someone from the outside to take care of the Frenchman. Why don't we apply to Billy Barone? He's my godfather, but besides that, he's honest and reliable. They sent him back to Sicily from America, but he is still a big wheel. And who is this Billy Barone? Is this big boss performing miracles or something, Lino? Sometimes. And what's more, he won't ask much. And how much will he ask? 10%. And we won't have any more trouble. The others agree we ought to try. - Where is he now? - Not far from Catania. Bravo, Caruso. Offer that kid who brought him here something to drink. Thank you. He's a good kid. Alright, Carmela. Leave us alone. She's my sister's daughter, but it's as if she were my own after her father had been locked up in jail. As I was saying, you should come to Milan because... Milan! Wait a minute, my boy! First of all, who is this Salvatore Cangemi? Don't worry, you can trust him. How can I help you anyhow? I just got back from America. I'm out of the loop. Besides, I have the sunshine here, the oranges... Don't talk like that! You still have blood in your veins and business is more important than oranges. Well now, what message might I take Cangemi? He's itching with impatience! He has ants in his pants! OK, my boy. I feel like breathing a little smog. I'll come to Milan... ...and solve out the situation. Your Honor, there's nothing coincidental about these acts of violence. So you think they're all connected with the murder of Vannaccina? Vannaccina was involved in a vast drug smuggling ring, which we haven't as yet been able to trace to the top. I believe that what is happening now is just the beginning. The beginning of what? Of a kind of war between pimps and drug dealers. Do you have any definite suspects? I could give you a few names... maybe ask you to sign a warrant for the arrest of Salvatore Cangemi... but you wouldn't sign it... ...due to lack of real evidence. It's better if we wait for the other players to surface. For someone to make a mistake. Or for someone to tip us off. A little Chicago! Don't worry, Totò. It will all be fixed in a few days. Anything you want just ask for. Money is no problem, Billy Barone. OK. How about a shot of whiskey to start with? - To your health. - To yours. - Keep the change. - Thank you, sir. - Shall we go? Excuse me. You're the Captain, Roger Daverty, right? Totò Cangemi asked me to say hello. This is better than drugs, isn't it? I was sent one in Chicago stuffed with dynamite... ...but here I am, alive and bursting with health. Oh, by the way... My name is Barone. Billy Barone. Give me 3 packs. Son of a bitch! Hurry up! Hurry up! - What's going on here? - Fuck you! Hide it. Two hits. Give me your bag! Passport, please. Alright, you can go. Freeze! What have you done?! Bastard! Bastard! No! Come on! Let's go! There's nothing in here. They tricked us. Bunch of idiots! The drugs were in her tits! It says so in the paper! Maybe it's better like this. What do you mean "better like this", Barone? These Sicilians! They treat their women so badly! They were bringing a consignment of heroin from Switzerland. The woman who was killed was a prostitute and the man is a Greek named Takis. - And you think he'll talk? - I'm sure of it. I threatened to extradite him to Greece where he was sentenced to death for political crimes. It's likely that you will have to sign some arrest warrants today. - Hello. - Hello. - They asked if you can move your car. - Right away. - You won't leave? - No, I'll be here. Quick! Hurry up! He'll be back any minute! Get out of here. So you want to rat on us, eh Takis? Taxi! You don't need one. You can put the lady's bags on the Mercedes. Let's get moving. I'm in a hurry. Who told you I was arriving today? The FBI. Satisfed? You guys go on the Mercedes. I'll take the Fiat 125. - Totò, what are you doing? - It's not wise. I'm sick and tired of being wise! Just do as I say, boys! You seem a little down, Sicily. I missed you. I had a wonderful time in London! My ex-husband is a darling! He knows so many fabulous people! I'm out of cigarettes. Do you mind stopping at that gas station? Hey, what's the boss up to? He's not behind us anymore. Goddamn! We'd better go back! Would you look at this guy! Everyone, freeze! Hands on your head! Come on! Quick! They could have killed us! Those sons of bitches! That was a close one, Totò! What happened? The guys from the French gang got across our path. They probably thought that you were in the car. Obviously. But what I don't get is why they only fired at the tires. Have they really gone mad? We won! What did I tell you! Mind if I have some more chips with a check? Of course, sir. Drop the 'sir'. Stay where you are! Police! Stay where you are! Documents, please. Documents? Documents? This is my house. We were doing no harm here. We are gambling just for pleasure. I hope it's a question of charging you with running an illegal casino. My men are searching your house. I don't understand. He must have friends in high places. I was counting on his being expelled for the illegal gambling charge. So this is the way things are done in America? The Al Capone method was a long time ago. This is the age of diplomacy. Look at America and Russia. It seems like any minute they're really going to be at each other's throat... ...but neither one has the guts to let go the atomic bomb. And you and the French guy are like America and Russia. My tactics could be called 'diplomatic violence' or something of that kind. We have to push them to the edge, understand? For your sake I hope you're right, Billy Barone. Lino... And they claim that English girls are frigid! Hold on! Let me at least catch my breath! I like it when you speak Sicilian. I like everything about you, Lino. Yes, he's here. - It's for you, darling. - Who is it? - Pino Scàlia. Scalìa, not Scàlia. When are you going to learn Italian? When you come to visit me more often. What is it, Pino? Can't we ever be left to work in peace? Fine. I'm on my way. I'll be there in a half an hour. Get out! Thank you, Fernando. What time is it? It's 7.45, Captain. They're late. Come on! Get moving! How are you, Mr. Caruso? And how's your friend Cangemi? - What do you want from me? - I want to talk to you as a friend. We're not friends. We will be soon. It's in our common interest, believe me. Won't you sit down? Champagne for my friend Caruso! If you want to kill me, hurry up! And why should I kill you? You're a smart guy. You're Cangemi's right-hand man. You know all the details of his organization. - The girls obey you. - So what? You could become the boss. Is he invisible or something? He was supposed to be here at 9 and it's already past 10! Find him! Lino's never late. What's that supposed to mean? I don't like it. I don't like it either. Could you sign this for me, please? - Caruso hasn't called, has he? - No. Not yet, Mr. Cangemi. Hello? Hello, my friend. How are you? Listen, Frenchy. I already have enough shit as it is! Go fuck yourself! No, my friend. You mustn't talk like that. I was just talking about you with a friend of ours. Your right-hand man is here with me now. You picked up Caruso? You could put it that way. We were just having a little chat. Would you like to hear his voice? What are they doing to him? Bastards! Sons of bitches! Why don't you just kill me?! What do you say, my friend? What do you want me to do to leave him alone? You know what I want: to work along with me on my conditions. Payment on delivery at a price that's fixed by me. Which is still far below what you'd pay on the market. Don't give in, Totò! Don't do it! You have a faithful friend, Cangemi. I'm sure that you want him returned to you alive and well. If not... If not? Alas, I will be forced to ruin such a fine Sicilian specimen. Bastard! Don't give in to this scumbag! For the moment no guns, OK? So what should I do? Do I have to just stand by and let them kill Lino? He's like a brother for me! Don't forget he's also my godson, Totò... ...which is why we must move with caution. And what do you suggest then? That we pretend to go along with the French guy and double-cross him at the last moment? No! He won't fall for it! Once, in Chicago, I knew a killer... ...they used to call him "Mosquito"... ...and do you know why? Because he always found a way to get to his prey. He never gave up! Leave it all to Billy, Totò... ...and everything will end up ok. Let's go, Orso. "Bye-bye, boys!" What does that mean, anyway? Do you understand? It all depends on you, Virginia. There's no time to lose! Go on! A whiskey. Straight. Give me another. I'm Nino Balsamo's girlfriend... ...the Sicilian that was killed two weeks ago by Cangemi's gang. I want revenge! Even if I have to die for it! Tell your boss that Cangemi will be at my house tonight at 10 o'clock... ...alone! - This is it, Fernando. - Good. It looks as if they are going away. What the hell are you doing with that cigarette? Go back near the door! What's the use, Totò? We've been waiting two hours! And we'll wait right up to dawn if necessary! Totò! They're coming back again! Open it. Totò! Look! They beat it! Hey! That looks like... ...Lino's tie! They murdered him. He's run away! As you like. I don't feel like waiting! Let's get all our boys together and finish that French guy for good! Yeah, but if Lino's still alive, they'll kill him before we get to the villa. Listen, Totò. That American, Billy Barone, may be a pain in the ass... And? Well, the guy knows where he's at. What do you want me to do? Drop on my knees and pray?! No. I didn't say that... It's one of ours. - Lino! But... - Ciao. Lino! Come here! Are you OK? Come on, sit down. - He let you go free? - Go free? I got out of the place! I escaped by a hair's breadth. You're fantastic, Lino! That French bastard figured he was up against amateurs! Now I'll show him who Salvatore Cangemi really is! It's not worth it. And for many of reasons. The future lies in drugs! Today, even priests, when they're saying Mass, use it! And the Frenchman controls the market. What's got into you? You're starting to preach like that Billy Barone now? Billy Barone is no fool. He's proven it. We should listen to him. So what should I do? Give in? That's not what I said. That's not what I said... That's not what I meant... Can't you people say anything else? God damn it! My friends! Lino! Lino, my godson! I bet you escaped, right? Bravo, Caruso! Give me a shot of whiskey! Totò! I know how to set up the Frenchy! He's in a motel in Lambrate... with his sweetie-pie. Good evening, sir. Would you like a bungalow? You don't need to be scared. Just tell me where I can find the owner of that Jaguar outside and then stay here nice and quiet. - Sure, but there's no need to... - Cut the crap! Now. Where is that bungalow? Number 17. Over there on the right. It must be true that 17 is an unlucky number. My darling. Takes that off. I hope we're not intruding... Don't try any funny business! My men are waiting outside! Freeze! What do you think you're doing? Do you want to destroy our goldmine? You lousy bastard! This fuck almost fried my balls off! Well, then at least I'm going to have a little fun with her! The Sicilian way! Help yourself! You bitch! You only go with the French, eh? Christ! You pulled her mane off! I don't know anything! I haven't done anything wrong! She's a man! Holy shit! The Frenchman is a fag! You disgusting pig! Son of a bitch! Dickhead! I didn't do anything! Degenerate! Let him go! Alright then. What are your conditions to working together? Just 50%! Payment of the goods half on delivery and half in 12 weekly installments. The price to be fixed by an impartial expert. Fine. I see you are a reasonable man. Do you have anything available now? About 200 kilos of hashish and 20 kilos of pure heroin. Does it seem enough? It's not too bad for a beginning. And where do you keep this stuff stashed? Now you're asking too much, my friend. Frenchy! My friend Cangemi could ask you for the moon, and you have to hand it to him on a silver platter! We use a medicine factory as a cover-up. We stash the goods in their warehouse in Segrate. Good! Now we can go pick up the first load! And the cash? Hey! No problem, Frenchy! The money is all set to go! Health and happiness to all our friends! Cheers. Cheers. Where are you from? Paris? No, madam. I was born in Corsica. Would you like to dance? I'm sorry. Some other time. She is busy now. It hasn't been easy, believe me. Up to 6 years ago I didn't have a cent and anyone could kick me around. I came to Milan along with Lino Caruso. We didn't know how to do anything. We had no skills. So we took whatever work we could get... ...dishwasher... valet... night watchman. There was no way out. We Sicilians have "peasant" written all over our faces! Keep going. I want to know everything about you. We started stealing small stuff, but we weren't so good at it... ...so it was back to skid row. But fortunately I ran into Teresina, a nice Sicilian girl. She worked in a snack bar... ...and at night she used to bring us leftovers and a few bucks. All three of us slept on a cot together. It was a shitty life! Then one day she got fired and we all decided to go back to Sicily... ...and it was then we got the idea. We were waiting at the station for the night train south... ...when Lino suddenly realized that Teresina had disappeared. Two hours later she came back with a chicken, some bread and a bottle of wine... ...and she also had 25,000 lire. A present from Santa Claus? On her way to the john she ran into this guy who wanted to make her, and she said yes for 30,000 lire/50 bucks, but it's what gave us the idea! - Then what happened? - We stayed in Milan... ...and started bringing some girls up from Sicily. And that's how I became the boss of the whole organization and today I am Salvatore Cangemi, the industrialist! Or "commendatore", as they call me here in Milan! I own 11 apartments, a billion lire in the bank, half in Swiss bank accounts... ...and I'm also crazy about you! That makes two of us, Sicily! - 141,600,000 lire! - How about that! Better than Las Vegas! And all that in just four weeks! Totò, you've got to admit that I was right. OK. We give you 20%. What do you mean? I thought we agreed on 10%! Totò! It was 10% before the war... ...but now that things are going nice and easy... ...I ran up a lot of expenses, you know. OK. Give the Frenchman just half of the sum he's expecting, OK? Half? But... Don't worry about it. I'm always the one who covers the expenses. If that's what you want. Come on, Giorgino. It's not so desperate. You're not the first one who couldn't get it up. It's finished! All I seem fit for now is the garbage... ...and just think, up until a little while ago I... What about trying some drugs? Just a simple shot and you'll be a gorilla! - Do you have it here? - Of course! It'll cost you a bit more. 100,000 lire, OK? Who is it? It's me. Open up. Just what we needed! How did it happen? After he shot up he started to feel sick and gasp and... My God, what are we going to do? We need to get rid of him and lose him someplace. Once he's dead, right? Right! He could stay in a coma like this for three days. Let's help him out a bit. Ok, here we go! Come on! - At your command, commissioner. - Good morning. Sartori! Have the car towed away at the police car park! You can leave the car registration with me. Here it is. A fucking prick! That's what you are! - But Totò, I figured... - What did you figured, eh? You should have figured that he wouldn't arrive there on foot... ...and that would leave his car parked outside the house! And that sooner or later the police would found it! Ok, I made a goof... ...but I sent Vanessa back home and the apartment isn't under our name, so relax. Relax?! How can I relax?! Did they fry your brain instead of your balls? Listen up, Lino! I'm going to be frank with you. You made one bad mistake last night! Even worse than yesterday when you took Barone's side about his share! You're wrong, Totò! You shouldn't talk to me like that. You've been drinking too much lately. Lino, I'm sorry! I don't know what got into me! Jasmine? Yes, sure. Fine. See you later. Ciao. Get on with it! That man over there is losing a fortune! Totò, what are you doing? Are you nuts? You've already lost more than 30 million lire/50,000 bucks. Mind your own fucking business! It's my money, I'll do what I want with it! Not all of it, some of it is mine! Just don't forget my 20%! Get out of here! Roger! Give me another 20! There's no logic this evening at all. Good morning. Shall I put the car away in the garage? - Yes. - Thank you, Mr. Barone. Harry, my boy! Hi, Billy! You look younger than ever! Don't give me that crap! Time passes for everyone! So what's new in Rome? Everything's fine, Billy. Who's the Frenchman's supplier? You managed to find out? Yeah, but it certainly wasn't easy. Who is he? A rich Lebanese based in Rome. He makes out he's a rug importer. He tried to make a fool out of me, but he didn't succeed. What's his name? Here. It's all written down there. Thanks. What peace! It's true. If you think about how they live in the city... ...the traffic... the smog... and all the rest. You made me discover what life has to offer, Jasmine. Mr. Cangemi! I'm going to the village. I could pick up anything you want. I'll be back in a couple of hours. - Yes, Giulio, my cigarettes, thanks. - Yes, miss. Will you get that, Sicily? Goddamn it. Yes? Oh, it's you. What is it? It's like that, eh? Fine. I'll get to Milan in about an hour. Who was it? Lino Caruso. I've got to go to Milan, but I should be back by this afternoon. Oh! I don't feel like being left alone! Here. Put this in your beauty case, in the false bottom like last time. It's 25 million lire. Tomorrow we'll go to Switzerland. Totò, what kind of game are you trying to play? What the hell are you talking about? And what's the reason for this meeting of blockheads? The Frenchman is threatening to not supply us anymore if you don't pay up on the past installment! It's come to that point, has it? You owe me almost 200 million lire. I have to pay my supplier who of course has to pay others. And you called me all the way here because of that? Does it seem like a small thing to you? The Frenchman wants to get paid and we need more supplies. In two days you'll have your money, OK? But I see that you have money for villas on the French Riviera. You just spent a quarter of a billion lire and registered the villa in Jasmine's name. Mind your own business! You've always been paid, right? And in two days you'll get paid again, OK? Goodbye. Two days and no more. Here's your ticket and boarding pass. Have a good journey. There won't be any delay, will it? No. Don't worry. The flight will be right on schedule. - My God! For a moment I thought... - That I might be your Sicilian. No, he hasn't received his little surprise yet. You did a good job, my dear. He's on his knees. I should congratulate myself, but... ...perhaps I should congratulate you first. You earned 200 million lire. 250 million. Oh, my dear. I almost forgot. You are a rich woman now... ...and you can spend your money with whoever you like. Good luck, Roger. And look out for the Sicilian. Don't worry. He's finished, thanks to you. Jasmine! Jasmine! Jasmine! Giulio! Giulio! Coming, Mr. Cangemi! - Yes, Mr. Cangemi? - Where's Miss Jasmine? I took her to the airport. To Malpensa. You did what? Yes. She told me that you'd be meeting her there. - Get out of here! - OK. Fucking bitch! Whore! Commissioner Contalvi. I have some interesting news for you, commissioner. Who's speaking? My name doesn't matter. Just listen to what I have to say. Hello? Who's there? - Good evening. - Good evening, Mr. Cangemi. I have a search warrant here. What do you have against me, commissioner? I guess I'm just stubborn. Come on, let's go. Lead the way. Please. And just what do you think you're going to find in my house? Oh, right. Drugs! Then start searching! The sooner you finish, the better it is for both of us! You guys start searching the living room and the bedrooms! You come with me. Carry on, men. Let's see. Where do you think you're going to find these drugs? Perhaps here, in the refrigerator... ...or in the oven... ...or maybe in this cupboard stuck into the bread. I told you we'd find something. Don't make a sound or I'll kill you! Think of an excuse to get out of here! Quick! I'll go on a check up on the garage. Cangemi is with me. In the meantime, keep searching. - Alright, commissioner. - Get moving! It's no use, Cangemi. You're finished. Shut the hell up, commissioner! This is pure heroin. Officer! Go down to the garage and fetch Commissioner Contalvi! Yes, sir! Open up, Virginia! It's me! Quick! What's wrong? Here's the bag you left here, Totò. Stop crying, stupid. Go to Switzerland! Save yourself! You've got to think of yourself now! Here. Take your baby and go back to your village. Get out of this shit before it's too late. Calling all cars! Keep on the lookout for a certain Salvatore Cangemi. Age 33. Physical description. Height: 5'11"... Color of hair and moustache: dark brown. Cangemi is armed and is driving a Mercedes coupé. License nr. MI L09115. Momma! My son! So I see you once again! What are you talking about, mom? Soon you'll be better and I'll take you back to Sicily. No, son. I won't get to see my village again. But you will. You've got to promise me that you'll go back there. This is no life for you. Promise me. You two come with me! You stay here! - Commissioner Sartori, Flying Squad. - Can I help you? We're looking for the owner of that Mercedes coupé parked outside. I don't know anything. You have to ask the permission of the administrator. - I've no authorization to give any information. - Call the administrator! - I don't know if at this hour... - Do what I say! Don't move, Frenchman! You shouldn't have played that dirty! Your trip in Italy is finished! Stay right where you are, Cangemi! Your trip in Italy is finished too! This organization thinks it's time for a new boss and I'm taking over command! Your men agreed to it! Lino. We came to Milan together... ...and we are about to go together. Why did you do it? We'll do great things together, boys! There it is! Just look at it! It really is just a little Chicago!
