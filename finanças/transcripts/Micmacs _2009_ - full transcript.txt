Hello? Good morning, is your mother in? Are you ready? I must go now. Jesus, the son of God ... ...descended on earth and suffered ... ...to pay for our sins. You're in danger. I do not care, As long as I am near you. I never thanked you for your help. It was brave, very courageous. I've never seen you so beautiful. I think I am in love with you. You'll come with me to the police? No. Why? I killed Charles Ringan. Would you tell the Commissioner? Yes, if you ask it I don't want to. Listen, I'm very tired. I feel quite stiff. I killed a man and I witnessed the murder of a poor soul. It's all because Geiger sang Carmen. If I told, your home would be invaded by police ... ... before you'd have time to flee. Perhaps she'll recover. I've seen it in the past. We'll let your father know about Ringan. You forgot something. Me? What do you have? Nothing you can't heal If I extract the bullet, he'll be a vegetable. If I don't, he'll be living on the knife's edge. Better to be alive at the risk of dying ... ...then to be dead. This is closer to philosophy than medicine. Heads or Tails? Heads! OK, I'll leave it. It'll ring the alarms at airports! They changed the lock. What happened, did you comb hair with a can opener? Where's my stuff? It was in the cellar. But you know people... After 3 days, there was not more than odd socks left That's my hat. Hey ... My little Bazil ...

I hope they took the lead from your head. I'm back, faithful to the position. But the position was not faithful to you. I had to replace you. This is Lola. Three-month trial. We just signed a permanent contract. Ah ... Well, we haven't kissed. Mr. Bazil! Don't listen to him. In fact, I have a boyfriend. His name is Ricardo. He picks me up every night on his motorcycle. He always parks there. Where you were shot. One day, while riding... We heard a small noise, like a pebble stuck in the tire. Mr. Bazil, it was not a pebble. Which hand? Make an effort. She puts her head under her feet and her toes in the nose And then does the splits. She spins and coils like a caterpillar. Suddenly, her legs around his neck She spins, like a ball and nibbles his knees. The rubber woman. With her, what fun they can have. Ah, it's crazy. It's enough to make you go funny in the head. They search below and they find it underneath. The rubber woman. Thank you ... You got five minutes? I spent my life in jail. So they call me "Closet". I'm Bazil. I know. You're a sweet in a jar.
