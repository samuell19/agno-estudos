MILLY: We missed you, Dad. I missed you, too. Ivan and Catherine, thank you both... for looking out for them. Captain Farrier, of course. Oh, it's Holt, come on now. It's just Holt. Don't you worry.

Hey, Miss Atlantis. Pramesh! The very best journey, dear friend. The road that leads home. Welcome home. (LAUGHING) (SNAKE HISSING) (GRUNTING) No hugs! Pramesh, I missed you, too. What's going on? The camp's half the size it used to be. Hard times, my friend. For everyone. - (CLATTERING) - (MAN EXCLAIMING) - (GRUNTING) - (MONKEY CHITTERING) MAX: Attention, everybody! Why is Rule Number One called Rule Number One? Because "keep the cages locked" is the most important rule of all! When I catch that fugitive scalawag who interrupted my dream... Rongo! Where is Rongo? (GASPS) Who's heading camp management? I'm the strongman. Yes, but we're all wearing multiple hats! You're in charge of budgets, and accounting, and inventory. Which means animal whereabouts! Now, go find that monkey! I'll have a look around. (CHITTERING) (GASPS) MAX: All right, everybody. Back to work. Holt! This winter, the influenza hit us like a hurricane. Natalya, Vincenzo... the Vanderjees, and then... your wife. Poor Annie. How she fought. She was the best of us. I know it. So, uh, you know, for her, let's have our best season yet! Now where's my horses? Ah... Funny story about that. Funny how? BOTH: He sold them. But our act is the soul of this show! And first, we lost you, and then Annie, to ride 'em! If only Milly would have learned the trade. I don't wanna be a show-off in your circus. - "Show-off"? - You see? I wanna make scientific discoveries. I wanna be noticed for my mind. Okay. Then learn clairvoyance. Telepathy! Something! I can do a handstand for almost ten seconds. - MAX: Oh. - (JOE GRUNTS) "Child does handstand." We'll be broke by July. Hang on now. Without horses, what the hell's my act? The crowds come to see me! Max, please. I need to work. Good news. One job, I have. Okay, then. Give me a showstopper. You know that old rascal Itchy McPhee? He finally ran off with the bearded lady. I've been filling in with roustabouts ever since. I need somebody good to tend the elephants. No, you're not serious. I am on occasion. This is a big job and you know it. No, it's a big shovel for a big pile of... KIDS: Dad. So you sold my horses and kept your elephants. Your scrawny, mangy, cut-rate elephants. They're important. Especially this season. Why's that? I know it goes against my nature... but for once, I made an investment. (GRUNTING) Bellissima! There she is! Our brand-new Asian female. I bought her off a Brugelbecker in Biloxi. I had to get him way down on the price. But I swear to you, Holt, I saw something special in her eyes. HOLT: This is your investment? An old, sick elephant. Oh, no. She's not sick. Any day now... she's having a baby. (ELEPHANT BREATHING LABORIOUSLY) Dad, watch! Dad! I'm getting better! Hang on now, this is our tent? What happened to our things? We had nice furniture, we had rooms. Max, what didn't you sell? You son of a gun. JOE: Dad, look! Toys? They're not toys. They're for my science experiments. Well, we're a circus, darlin', a circus. We need to be practical if we want to survive. You couldn't just take up one act? Tumblin' or tightrope? Maybe I don't need the world staring at me. Maybe I'm just not you and Mom. Well, who makes the rules in this family? Mom did. HOLT: Yeah, well, I make them now. So just, uh... Go to your room! This is my room. This is all our rooms. HOLT: See this? You know what this is? It's your inheritance. JOE: Dad! Don't worry, he's not going anywhere. He's stuck here. Like you and me. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (GRUNTING) JOE: Come on, come on, you're missing it! Look, I can do it!

But he just ain't on the marquee no more. Time to see what he's been missing. Do you ever get that feeling? Like there's something you're missing? Imagine my surprise, you didn't enlist. - Weak ticker. Doc's advice. - Uh-huh. - Dad? Something's wrong. - (MEN GRUNTING) She doesn't wanna leave. Come on!

Never do anything I tell ya without checking with me first! (SIGHS) Why me? Why me? A face only a mother could love. MISS ATLANTIS: Sir? Many of us find you handsome. I was talking about the elephant! Look, she's drawing him a bath. (SQUEALING) Need a vet to come to look at him, Max. No, no witnesses! We are going to be in Joplin for two weeks. We promised them a beautiful baby! You have until tomorrow night to fix that! - HOLT: Me? - Yes, you! This is my problem? Yes. You tend the elephants. Make those ears disappear! Don't look at me. JOE: Look at him, those giant ears weigh him down. Hi, Baby Jumbo. - Welcome to the circus. - (SQUEAKING) We're all family here. No matter how small. Aren't elephants afraid of mice? Says who? That's why we experiment. Someone needs to keep him company. when he's not with his momma. (SQUEAKING) (SNIFFING) Look. Give him one. If he can lift his ears out of the way. No. You have to blow your ears out of the way. Like this. (BLOWING) (SNIFFING) Good luck with that. Maybe you can teach him to juggle, too. Baby Jumbo, look at me. Do what I do. Blow. (BLOWS) (HUFFING) (BLOWS) No, not the feather. Your ears. Blow! He thinks it's a game. - Oh, Max, come here. - What? Watch this. I ride out, I do some jumps, then all of a sudden...

What in gosh... You really broke the bank with this, Max. A lot of kids come to the show. You don't want me to scare anyone, I get it. Dad, Dad! It's Baby Jumbo. Come see. He jumped in the air. With his ears. Guys, I said leave him be. But he was this far off the ground! Yeah, I bet he was. He'll be tripping all over with ears like that. Dad, really. We tried an experiment. Just leave the poor guy alone. First rule of science, you have to have interest. Otherwise, you don't deserve to know. MAX: It's been a rough year for both of them. Annie knew how to talk to 'em.

This is what they're reading from the Great Lakes to the Gulf! You have a moral responsibility to buy your killer elephant back. What about the baby? (SCOFFS) Well, at least he got a few laughs. I'll put him in the clown act, see if I can salvage something. I'll buy her back half price. You will buy her back full price. Quarter price. Half price it is! - (TRUMPETS) - (MAN EXCLAIMING) Up!

And said whenever I have that feeling, imagine that door... and just turn the key. So, I keep trying. (DOOR OPENS) Not supposed to be in here alone. I'm not. You're here. What's that? JOE: I just thought he might be hungry. He's sad. You don't eat when you're sad. The mermaid does. Come on. Have one, Dumbo. We're calling him Dumbo now? If we call him Jumbo Junior... it might make him miss his mom. Here you go... Dumbo. Come on, and flap those ears again. To show us we didn't imagine it. Your momma, she didn't mean to hurt anyone. She was just protecting you. And we think your ears are great. Maybe he wants to be alone. Like Dad. Nobody wants to be alone. Well... if you change your mind... Night-night, Dumbo.

Just show them all what you can do. Come on. We gotta tell Dad. No. He'll just tell us to be practical. Shows got canceled for a week, right? We can research and study and test.

MAX: Hello, Jo! The Medici Brothers' circus. Where true love and mystery abound! Now where's my star? - (TRUMPETS) - Ah, Dumbo! How's your bath? Too warm? Too cold? Ladies, make sure his wrinkles don't get wrinkles. In our country, legend tells us the gods can take animal forms. Champagne for Dumbo! No booze near the baby! (TRUMPETING IN DISTANCE) (DUMBO TRUMPETS) (HORN HONKING) Sorry, Dumbo. It's not your momma. Take Dumbo back inside. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Ladies and gentlemen, please make way for the emperor of enchantment. For the architect of dreams. For the Columbus of Coney Island. Mr. V.A. Vandevere! (PEOPLE GASP) (APPLAUSE) And traveling with him, his bright shining star. Colette Marchant, the Queen of the Heavens! MAN: Miss Marchant! Miss Marchant! (APPLAUSE) Ah. Signore Medici! He knows who I am. We were just passing through Missouri... and we heard you were putting on a little show. Mr. Vandevere. It's an honor. No, sir. The honor is mine. MAX: I would like to offer you a drink. But I'm all out of bourbon. - (GRUNTING) - (RATTLING) And cognac and scotch. - (CHITTERING) - (MAX YELPS) - Not now! - (MUFFLED CHITTERING) (FAINT RATTLING) Is that a monkey in your desk? Just for emergencies. Look, Mr. Vandevere... I probably should tell you... the elephant is not for sale. Dumbo will only fly for the Medici circus. That's assuming he is real. See for yourself. And all due respect, I don't got all day. - Pleasure to meet you... - Excuse me. Hello there. So this, uh, creature of yours... is supposed to fly? Trade secrets. (CHUCKLES) Ugh. (SNIFFING) VANDEVERE: Uh, Max, if you don't mind my asking... where did you come upon the animal? He hails from the far east. How far? Far. He doesn't look like "magic" to me. Well, what the heck can you tell by appearances, right? And you train flying elephants, too? Yeah, it's a little hobby on the side. It's the kids taught Dumbo. Ah, yes. Yeah? And how on earth did you do that? With the scientific method. (EXCLAIMS) One picture, one picture! Max. You possess something that's very rare in life. And the tragedy of it is, is you don't even know that you have it. Do you know what it is that you have, Max? No. It's mystique. VANDEVERE: Max, I know your type. Charlatan, con man, opportunist... New York is that way, in case you need directions. And I know it comes from a deep desire to build something authentic and true. I know your game. It's not a game. Some men cheat the rules, others change them. It's up your sleeve. It's in your pocket. The secret to show business is always keep a rabbit in your hat. Or a monkey in your desk, I guess. MAX: Ownership shares? Max, look around you. Your entire way of life is dying. The future of the entertainment business is to bring the audience to you. And I've built that destination. What I'm lacking... is a protege. I know there's no Medici Brothers. You probably always wanted one. You're offering me a partnership? Yes. And a home. For you and the entire troupe. A home? For all of us? Yes. Join me. Join me and my family. Let me take us all into the future. Let me take us all... to Dreamland! (BAND PLAYING) I wish Momma could've seen this. Well, somehow, I think she knows we're here. (CROWD CHEERING) Way to work your magic, Max. (DUMBO TRUMPETS) We hear you, Dumbo! Why won't you let him see outside? Remember, young lady... mystique. (BAND CONTINUES PLAYING) Now this is why I joined the circus. Dad. Wonders of Science! All right, sugar plum. Remember, we got a job to do here. My daughter, she fancies herself the next Marie Curie. Don't ever let anybody tell you what you can't do. Hang on, I wasn't saying she can't. What is it exactly that we do here, ma cherie? We make the impossible possible. SOTHEBY: And that's where you'll perform. The Colosseum! Dumbo will stay in the training tent behind. JOE: Dumbo! (TRUMPETS) Why aren't we going with him? Because that is your new home. JOE: Wow! Look at this place! A library... "And the children shall lead them." We're grateful for the opportunity, Mr. Vandevere. Oh, your family's mine. - (HORSE NEIGHS) - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) You know, I've been brushing up on your story, Mr. Farrier. Kentucky's top trick rider. Well, there's no reason you can't be again... only here, you'd be Captain Farrier... war hero. (FANFARE PLAYS) One-armed wonder. National treasure. HOLT: Wow! (STAMMERS) Well, I still can ride. VANDEVERE: Oh, I know you can. And you're going to. Right after you get that little elephant off the ground for me. You mean once his act's working? You're back in the saddle. We're still working on the schedule for the rest of your troupe... but on Friday... we premiere our little Dumbo. I get goose bumps. Why are you looking at me? Well, because the only thing more amazing than a flying elephant... is the goddess who can fly it. Have you lost your mind? (SCOFFS) Let's not forget from whence we came, darling. So, we fly Friday! Uh, Dumbo's never flown with anyone. That's why it's become abundantly clear why we need you. MILLY AND JOE: Dumbo! (TRUMPETS) Hey, buddy. We missed you. You all right? Hey. Captain Farrier is in charge. No one sees the animal without his approval. Holt. Just call me Holt. I thought you were a military man. Nice boots you bagged there. What are they, shark skin? (CHUCKLES) No. So you better keep your elephant friend on my good side. Hiya, Dumbo. Dumbo, you mind? Can I get my arm? And these are the hands I'll be putting my life in? Welcome. For the record, this was not my idea. Dumbo works alone. So do I. Bonjour, Milly, Joe... And you... (HUFFS) Hmm, charming. Well, maybe he doesn't recognize you without your makeup. So I gotta teach you to fly? I know how to fly, ever since I was a child. They taught Dumbo to fly, no? So I don't need your expertise. HOLT: All right. Well, just so you know, I've been to France. It wasn't a good experience. COLETTE: Show me your secret! How on earth does your elephant fly? Well, first, he needs a feather. He won't fly without a feather. Well then, neither will I. (SNIFFING) (SPEAKS FRENCH) (SPEAKS FRENCH) (SHRIEKS) (TRUMPETS) Whoa, slow down, princess. Safety first. Guys, nets. Come on, hurry. All right, guys, good. - See, Dumbo? - (DUMBO TRUMPETS) I fly! See if you can catch me! Here, Dumbo! (SNIFFING) (DUMBO TRUMPETS) (GASPS) (SCREAMS) (DUMBO TRUMPETING) (SNIFFING) Oh, we got some work to do. - (MACHINERY WHIRRING) - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Friends and colleagues... let's give a warm Dreamland welcome to our new executive vice president... Mr. Max Medici. Anything he needs, anything at all... make it happen as you always do. This is Miss Verna. She will handle your schedule, correspondence, and all your calls. When you're needed in meetings, she'll let you know. Are there meetings today? I'll let you know! (TYPEWRITER DINGS) MAX: Uh, Mr. Vandevere, one question. Exactly what do I do? (MUMBLES) HOLT: So where'd Vandevere find you? I was a street performer in Paris. He discovered me. And here I am. A millionaire's girlfriend. That's a tough break. It's all for show. So you and he, you're not, uh... I'm one of many gems he wears to reflect the light back onto him. Huh. Good boy, Dumbo. - MILLY: Good job. - Yeah! They're gonna love him. I think you are the lucky one. - JOE: Well done, Dumbo. - MILLY: Good boy. (SINGSONGY) Who's been dreaming like I've been dreaming? So, how's everything? - Good? - Oh, we're making progress. But he ain't quite ready yet. What's the problem? Doesn't the animal trust you? - It's not that simple. - Ma cherie... we've already sold all the tickets. Maybe our little scientist here can show us that it's going to work. (DUMBO TRUMPETS) MILLY: Prepare for takeoff. - Right wing? - Check! Left wing? Check! Take her up, Dumbo. Let's go. - JOE: Come on, buddy. Come on. - MILLY: Come on, Dumbo. That's it. Come on. (TRUMPETING) MILLY: Let's try it again. (TRUMPETS) You got this. Here you go. (DUMBO TRUMPETS) You beautiful one-armed cowboy. You've made me a child again. (FANFARE PLAYING) ANNOUNCER: Welcome to the Colosseum... where the impossible is possible. (ORCHESTRA PLAYING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC) Buonasera. Max Medici. I discovered the elephant, my elephant. And basically I said no. I walked out and that was the end of that. MAX: The flying elephant's mine. VANDEVERE: Yeah. You're the guy! You're the guy that's made out of magic dust! VANDEVERE: Max. J. Griffin Remington. Atlas Forge Bank. He's the money man. The J? Whoa! It's a pleasure to meet you. How are you? You know, they say the moon is made out of magic dust. That's why they're going to send a man up there one of these days. And my bank is going to be the bank that finances the expedition. What do you think of that? Uh-huh. VANDEVERE: Needless to say, Max... we all have high hopes for tonight. Oh, yeah. High hopes. High hopes. Well, you know, hopes, and dreams, that's one thing. That's words. But what we're talking about here is facts! Plans! Plans! That takes a lot of money. Which he hasn't got! So, we are hoping that your pachyderm comes through with the goods. Now let's get this show on the road! (MUSIC CONTINUES) - (MUSIC STOPS) - (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) MAN: We are looking good! HOLT: Don't worry, Big D. There's just more room to fly out there, that's all. Round and round, just like we practiced. JOE: And then Dad can talk to Vandevere about the deal! HOLT: About the what? We made a deal with Dumbo. We promised we'd buy his mom back with all the money he makes for the circus. That's why he flies. - Joe, not now! - Are we ready? Yeah. (SPEAKS FRENCH) HOLT: Okay, let's go. Okay, Dumbo, let's do this. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) (SQUEALS) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Pink elephants?

But you haven't seen anything... until you see an elephant fly. Let's get ready for Dumbo! (AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) (ORCHESTRA PLAYING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC) Coming through. Come on. He can do it. I know he can. And here to welcome him... our own Queen of the Heavens! (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (ORCHESTRA PLAYING ETHEREAL MUSIC) (WHISPERS) Dumbo. Five times around the ring. That's all we have to do. Nice and easy, like we practiced. - Dad? - HOLT: Mmm-hmm. Why aren't they putting up the nets? Hey, guys? Guys, what's going on? Your men are supposed to be out there! Change of plan. From the top. (GASPS) I can't see the nets. - They're invisible. - REMINGTON: Hmm. What's wrong with you? They need nets! Colette! Wait, don't take off! COLETTE: Dumbo... Oh, boy! ...Prince of the Elephants. I command you to fly with me. (TRUMPETS) - (GRUNTS) - (AUDIENCE GASPS) - (YELPS) - (TRUMPETS) (ALL GASP) (TRUMPETING) - (FABRIC RIPS) - (GRUNTS) (TRUMPETING) Colette! - (SCREAMS) - (TRUMPETS) (AUDIENCE GASPS) - (AUDIENCE GASPS) - (TRUMPETING) Lower the platform! (TRUMPETING) - (DUMBO TRUMPETS IN DISTANCE) - (HOWLING) (ROARS) (TRUMPETING) (TRUMPETING IN DISTANCE) - (AUDIENCE GASPS) - Fly, little one! (ALL CHEERING) Magic dust! (MEN SHOUT) (ALL MURMURING) Where's my show? (TRUMPETING IN DISTANCE) The elephant's headed to Nightmare Island. - (DUMBO TRUMPETS) - (WOMAN YELPS) (PEOPLE CLAMORING) (ROARS) - WOMAN: Come on, sweetie. Let's go. - (GROWLING) (SNARLING) (TRUMPETING) (DUMBO TRUMPETS) (CHAIN CLANKING) Dumbo, it's okay. - We're here. - (ELEPHANT HUFFS) VANDEVERE: Good evening. MAN: It's Mr. Vandevere. - Hello, hi. - Hey, that's V.A. Vandevere! VANDEVERE: Everyone having fun? Good. - Having a good time? - MAN 2: Yes, sir. - (GROWLS AND TRUMPETS) - VANDEVERE: Fantastic. Get him outta here. - Yes. - WOMAN: Over here! - GUARD: Folks, please. - Hello. GUARD: Folks, I need you to leave the exhibit. - (DUMBO SQUEALING) - Come on. Guys, guys, go easy, he's just a baby. Soldier, I give the orders here. - (DUMBO SQUEALING) - (TRUMPETING) It's his bedtime. (PEOPLE MURMURING) ANNOUNCER: (ON SPEAKER) This attraction is now closed. (TRUMPETING CONTINUES) Dad? Uh-huh. It's Mrs. Jumbo. BOY 1: Come on, I want to see Dumbo! BOY 2: I want to see Dumbo! - MAN: I want my money back! - (ALL GRUMBLING) I don't understand. The elephant flies. You saw it. I saw a vanishing act. I'm not investing one cent until I can see this works. You can't control your animal. You give me a little time, I can fix this. Whatever! Till then, the bank is closed. What happened up there? You lost control of the animal. COLETTE: You're the animal. Where was my net? Nets are for rehearsal. This is the show. (DOOR OPENS) Training? You call that training? Now, hold on, Mr. Vandevere, we know why he flew away. He recognized that other elephant's call. The one on Nightmare Island. It's his momma! HOLT: It's true. It's her. She was sold from our circus two months ago. MILLY: Every child knows its mother. And they say elephants never forget. They can be together now. Why are there children in my office? Mr. Vandevere, please, all Dumbo wants is his momma. Just reunite them, and he'll do whatever you want. No, he'll do whatever she wants. You think I'd have bought her if I thought she was related to him? Hmm? (SCOFFS) Doesn't help me at all. (EXHALES SHARPLY) You wanna know the most important thing about growing up? You've got to learn to go it alone. Get rid of the mother. You know where to take her. And treat yourself to some new boots. But, sir, you can't just kill her. Why not? HOLT: Mr. Vandevere. Wait! Don't separate 'em, please. Don't do that to my kids. You know, Holt, when my father left us, it was a blessing really. Because I had to learn how to fend for myself. Maybe that's what your children need. Don't tell me what my children need. Best take a step back, Elephant Man. Darling... Dumbo and his mom need a little alone time. So, Mommy's going to take a little trip... so that Dumbo won't be distracted. Milly! Milly! Colette? I have rehearsal. Max. ANNOUNCER: (ON SPEAKER) Nightmare Island. Milly? Home of the most dangerous beasts in the world. GUARD: Sir, park's closing. HOLT: Milly! Milly! Did you find her? No. (HOLT SIGHS) Well, her momma always knew what to say. No matter what. She always knew. Your children don't need you to be perfect. They just need you to believe in them. That simple, huh? All right, well, I'm gonna keep looking. (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) (SIGHS) That's my daughter all right. The only girl I know who runs away to go to school. It's our fault. Bet Dumbo wishes he never met us. HOLT: Ah, you showed him he could fly. You think he'd ever trade that? He would to have his mom back. (HOLT SIGHS) I miss Momma. Yeah, so do I. There's something I want to show you. MAN: (ON SPEAKERS) With advances in both engineering and medicine... the human and the mechanical will soon be combined... to assist ordinary families, workers and veterans. All kinds of technological marvels await us in the 20th century. HOLT: You're gonna do great things. I know it. Whoa, whoa. What's this? Oh, give me a break. I gotta teach you how to read English, too? (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) Oh, Max, hello! Good, you brought the paperwork. Max... I was reviewing your troupe... and to be honest with you... they're really pale imitations from the acts we already have. So I was thinking, I don't know, a month's severance? Seems fair. Capisce? I thought you promised to... Max, the contract says that I'd hire them. It never stipulated for how long. So, get your little band of low-rent freaks out of here. But they're my troupe. They're countin' on me. Okay, let's have a heart. Why don't you tell them? (MUFFLED CHATTER AND LAUGHTER) 'Bout time, boss. So, when do we start? HOLT: What's going on, guys? Vandevere's fired them all. They're to leave by tomorrow. (DUMBO BREATHING HEAVILY) (WHIMPERS) PRAMESH: Goodbye, little friend. Goodbye. We wanted to see him one last time. One last time to see him fly. I don't think he wants to anymore. Oh, no. But he must. He cannot lose Mrs. Jumbo again! SOTHEBY: Uh, I'm afraid it's rather worse than that. Mr. Sotheby? I've come to clear my conscience. I resigned my position as soon as I heard him give the order. What order? Mrs. Jumbo will be gone by tomorrow night. And she's not meant to survive. (DUMBO WHIMPERING) This "Dreamland" doesn't deserve him. No circus does. Well, who's gonna be willing to help me? Set Dumbo and his momma free. (TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING) (EXCITED CHATTER) ANNOUNCER: (ON SPEAKER) Welcome to the Colosseum, where the impossible is possible. Okay. Second time's the charm. Let's see if Dream Daddy's worked out the kinks. TRUCK DRIVER: (ON PHONE) Here to pick up the elephant - from Nightmare Island? - Confirmed. Unlock the back gates. - Dumbo in position! - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Soon as he flies, you run back to his tent and I'll find you there. All right, Big D. (SQUEALING) HOLT: It's all up to you now. (EXHALES DEEPLY) Come on, Holt! (OBJECT THUDS) - To hell with it. - (CLATTERS) MAN: Ready for positions. We could have used a little rehearsal. Rehearsal? Think we got a rehearsal at the Battle of the Argonne? You sure you can do this? I fly elephants all the time. Are you sure you can do this? With one hand tied behind my back. (EXHALES SHARPLY) GUARD: Wait. What's that? Ma'am? Ma'am? Sorry, ma'am, attraction's closed. My dream... to be a mermaid... and now they've taken it away. And yet I hear the water singing. I hear them beckoning me home. Lady, just be careful, okay? MISS ATLANTIS: Return me to the vast abyss! Let's go. - My destiny, the sea! - Okay. (GUARD YELPS) (GRUNTS) (BARS CREAKING) (GAS HISSING) (BARKING) We've lost power! Even the cages? - GUARD 1: But the animals... - (GROWLING) Find the breakers. Get the lights back on!

Where is your circus of freaks? What's going on? The elephant's mother is gone! His troupe's behind it! Alert the tower and secure the gates. Don't let them get out. But why would they only take the one? Keep your eye on Farrier and those kids. You! Come with us. (MUSIC CONTINUES) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) There they are! SKELLIG: Hey! (MUFFLED THUMPING) (GRUNTING) GUARD 1: Hey, you! What are you doing up there? GUARD 2: That's private property. Come on! Get down here! Now! Hey, I'm Max Medici, Vandevere's partner. He's just a maintenance man fixing a light! Get back to your posts! Yes, sir, Mr. Medici. (TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING) (WHISPERING) Let's try this again. You and me. (GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Hey, the kids? Where are the kids? Hey, have you seen the kids? COLETTE: Dumbo, Prince of the Elephants! I command you to fly with me. (WHISPERING) Dumbo, please fly. Do it for your momma.

Electricity's failing! There's no elevators! When I last checked, they invented stairs. ANNOUNCER: (ON SPEAKERS) We seem to be experiencing some technical difficulties. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) What happened to my power? - (TRUMPETS) - What power, mon cheri? You ungrateful... You were nothing before I made you my... Uh... I believe the word is "queen." I need lights! (ALARM BLARING) Mr. Vandevere, wait! We have to reset the mains, or you could cause a surge! Right now it's impossible! Nothing's impossible! (GRUNTS) Mr. Vandevere! Mr. Vandevere, stop!

JOE: Dad, they're coming! - (BELL DINGING) - Stand back! Stand back! GUARD: Out of my way! Dumbo, remember this? From my momma? I can unlock any door. And you can, too.
