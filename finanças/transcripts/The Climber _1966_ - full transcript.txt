THE CLIMBER Why does it bother you? - No one needs it anymore. If it's like that, let it die as soon as possible. What sort of man are you? Imagine, I still don't know that. I don't know what you wanted to be like. Really, what did you want to be like? What is your name? - Ivan Stojanovic. Where do you come from? - Why does it matter? - I have to write it down. From periphery. I want to see general executive. General executive? - Yes. - Where do you work? Please inform the executive that Ivan Stojanovic has come. I'm in hurry. I don't have time. You can go. First floor. Room 10. Leave the suitcase here. Hello. What are we going to do with you? You say that collection is here? - Yes. I sent it almost a year ago. Actually, you should chase our redactors. They are informed better. - I wrote several times. They didn't respond. Here, it's not lost, of course. A birch among the winds, right? How come? There's your name. - It's not my name. It's similar. No, I won't go to the game. No, they are not in shape. There's no point losing nerves. Yes, but I can't right now. I have one... young man. Yes, call me a bit later. A minute or two. What are we going to do? Maybe you should come back in 10 days? I would... - You know... I care about that very much. I wrote collection for years. I came here right off the train. You did that good. Of course. But don't hurry young man. That isn't going fast. You said you're studying? - I'll sign in philosophy. Nice. They got their journal there. A student one. - Why? - For a young man... Hello! Hello, old friend. Where are you? At whose? I have to come even if everything goes... When did you come? Really? Train, yes... You're alone, folks are still in Paris, nice. I'm really glad, I'm really looking forward to it. I can't wait to see you. I believe. A tear of mine road that makes itself or train without tracks. Does he carry a bomb instead of the head? Does he strangle the words or they strangle him? Does he have a hole in his heart or is he fighting for air as a drowning? Or is he a torn off block of ice or a beast howling on it? Is he a thunder chained as a puppy or a cold fire in heart of stone? Does he carry frozen lightning in his arms? Is he going to be a tortured weakling? Does he have courge to stand and cry while worlds in him all their anger pour over him? He doesn't care. It's eays for him. Everything he touched came to life. Who wrote that? A good guy. You'll meet him one day. Perhaps. Once you make it as a poet. What are you studying? But of the world. I like domestic, but studying of the world. And you? Mistress! How much this lousy room costs? Who lives here and what are the rules? I want to know before I pay up front. House rules? Just came from periphery and asking right away about house rules. Room is wet, overcrowded, there's no running water. Are you spoiled, really... You've got water in backyard. If you're cold wash up here. Put your laundry in order. It doesn't have to be sprayed. What else do you want? It's wet. That's dangerous for health. Who says it's wet. I've been living here for years. Him too. What's wrong with us? He came to Belgrade yesterday. Student. Nobody wants to tile the land. Whatever. I certainly won't rent it. Why? It's not so bad here. You're different, Janketa. I don't have so much time. I am...a poet. You're not a good man. Why? - Because you're bad. Most of them are good. You think? I hate lazy ones, ignorants and cowards. That's why many say I'm not good. Even you. Now I know what you are. You're a clown. You're an acrobat. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Then you must be crazy. That's it. How come I didn't see that right away? What do you want? Nothing. - Why are you following me then? Just because. Then follow me when you're nuts. There, we have met. Are you pleased? What would you want? To sit here and entertain you, what? Whatever. You must be really bored. Do you have friends? Mostly. What mostly? Like that. Wait. Turn around. Wait, I cut my hair few days ago. You know nothing, it should be shorter. A bit from here... Now a bit from front... That's good now. Look at yourself. You look better now. Isn't it a bit short? Your jacket is short. And worn. Better throw it away or sell it. To throw it in Sava? - Sell it to peasants. Then apply to zadruga for work and buy another one. I undestand. When are we going to see each other? - We'll see. You're not as crazy as it looks. You'll find me. - Where? If you really want, somewhere in park. I'm off for a walk. Books forbbiden for older than 20 years. Books forbbiden for older than 20 years. Books forbbiden for older than 20 years. That one is 650. Let me see. That one is 680. I apologize. I see you're doing well. - Why? You're cheating them well. - Let them read poetry. It's useful. That's not job for you. Besides, why not ask for scholarship? I don't know how to do it. I don't like to beg. I'll see in Students' Alliance. If you're interested at all, of course. - Better don't. And I'll attack those comrades from Alliance soon. I don't think they work properly. When will I speak? - Wait when I finish. You're speak half an hour already. Okay, I'm done. Continue Gajic, let him speak. No, I won't. - Let him tell what he wants... Speak now, but tell us your name. My name's Ivan Stojanovic. I'm angry cause you're beating around bush like cats around hot porridge. We ask how to learn. We can't cause it chaos in our group. Professors know it's... Programs are changed whenever, and they are surrouned by poltrons who don't know anything. What did the Students' Alliance do? Nothing. What do comrades from Secretariat do? Nothing. I think that comrade went ahead a bit but there's a little truth. Don't beat around bush. Quiet, please. - Don't... Guy's right. Comrades, on the other hand, we're not working enoug. There are colleagues here who receive huge scholarships for years and take place for nothing. Who? Say exactly. If we can't remove them from university why don't we suggest to take away scholarships? And give to other better ones. You were fantastic. People went crazy. Why lie to ourselves? Just don't think comrades from Comitee will be pleased. You were too sharp. People aren't used to that. I didn't speak to them but to colleagues. You know, when one outside party speaks they ask from which point of view. Bravo, brother. You stopped at right moment. I was afraid you'd start listing names. Good you reminded me, I'll write an article in vers on them. They offered me a better place. To sell scripts at faculty. But I refused. - Why? Cause I found out you intervened for me. I didn't, honestly. I just said you're such and such. You praised me. - Not much. They asked me and I said what I thought. They say 'That guy of yours isn't all that bad'. Sharp. Lets go from here. No, I won't. Are you crazy? What about landlady? Lets go anywhere then. I want to love you a little. I'll show you a game. Stand next to me. Look around, pick a target, like that corner then close your eyes and walk. Neither left nor right. As many steps as you can the better. Lets try it. How many you can? - It depends. Sometimes 30. Besides, hold on to me. Lets go! As long as you hold on, you love me more. He writes for the newspapers. Screws up with peaceful folk. You'll get more beatings here. I tell you. Take a walk, auntie. And so you say, hired guys... Without witnesses. Please, is that the way? I'll revenge. But to who and how? Please don't write for newspapers anymore. What should I do? Keep quiet? You did good. Just, people who love justice always got beaten up. I read about much worse stuff in newspapers and nothing. But who wrote them? Those who are believed. Easy. They'll believe me too. I was born on 1944 in Smederevska Palanka. My father is civil servant and mother a houselady. During school, I went to work actions. In highschool, I was a leader of literary section and sports group. In belief, always close to the Party, but as I'm impatient in nature unsatisfied with work of local forums I fell outside of organization. Nevertheless, I feel a need to become active to direct all my strength into the most positive way, so I could become... Aren't you afraid? - What'd you say? Aren't you afraid of speed? No! Just keep straight! Why should I study? There's no place for us. There's in periphery. Do you want to go there? Why not? I know, you'll do anything as long as you stay on Kalemegdan-Slavija relation. Perhaps I won't. - Don't play dumb. While we're idle here, other people in Pais or Munchen are doing the right thing. You're not as naive as you look. Read that article. What does he want? - He drank a little so he complains. It's modern to complain. But he won't for long. Cheers. Have you ever thought about journalism? Why? - It's a nice job. I met Kaca Radak, a poet. She told me about her job. I know Kaca. I introduced you two. So then? What do you say about idea? What idea? To silently move onto television. And studies? I study to special program. I'm fed up with selling books. I want a decent life. Comrade Kaca. Comrade Kaca? - Yes? I'm here. I thought you didn't notice me. - Yes, Ivan. I saw you came late. Here's a topic for the first part of exam. A firm built 10 apartments from their housing fund. The firms had 37 people who were in need of housing. All cases were studied by the firm board, and a syndicate comission. Why do you say that? - To teach you, fristly. And secondly, journalists are on first name basis. Oh, hello. How are you? We can sit here. Alright, Kaca. Would I be accepted if I didn't know you? Maybe. That's not important anymore. Why wasn't Mali accepted, my friend? I like to do it myself. Do you like this one in the middle? - Not especially. You'll have to. If you come to us. I'll adjust then. Thank you. I apologize. - It's nothing. Look there. She's Milena Dravic, actress. She's beautiful, isn't she? Look with who she sits. You know Djordje Marjanovic? - Of course. Those there are writers. To the right is Scepanovic Brana. And Kis, he wrote excellent novel. I know 'Garden, Ashes". Arsen Dedic, I know him from TV. Who? No, that's Matija Beckovic. No, the one across him. Ah, yes, that's Dedic. Just lower your voice, they heard us. Who's she? - I've no idea, but she's handsome. She's not bad. Do you go to opera? Look there. Milka Stojanovic, she sings good. She sits with Sekularac. Seki, he's worth the money. Do you know that one there? Ah, Vojin! Of course. He was my first publisher. I'd like to meet him. People say he's great. No, thanks. I never drink. What's with the persistence? Why never? If I drank, I'd do it always. It's better this way for now. That's the young generation, Vojin. They seem to know what they are doing. I was once at yours but you don't remember. It was long time ago. No, it wasn't important. The talk was about...football. It's important we met again. To your health. Thank you. I drink even though I shouldn't. I see you're afraid of alcohol as well. No, we're a generation that isn't afraid. You too? We thought it was our specialty. Who's 'we'? I mean... Kaca, me, the ones you call war generation. I wish I was grownup when you were. The things were clearer. I don't think so. We can't make revolution every 10 years to make things clearer for you. Revolution is still taking place, right? We're making a new man. - Of course. It goes without mention. It was my pleasure, comrade Vojin. Goodbye comrade. I'm Ivan, student, TV journalist, perhaps we'll work together. Go for it, big guy. We need a new face. Boy got angry. - A little? He's courting more and skillfully at that. Whom? I guess you. Besides, guy is sympathetic. Ivan, no! For god's sake, it's stupid! Do you hear me? It's enough. It was a misunderstanding. Thank you. I read your poems again. They are beautiful, you know. Full of ecstasy. Why don't you write anymore? Too bad. Say it's beautiful! We could die. I love travelling. You? Good. To which city? How could it happen? It happened. I went suddenly. What does editor say? He says to write it for next show. I almost went to foreign affairs but I didn't know language good enough. Of course. You have to know at least one langauge perfectly. Right, Ivan? Don't submit your paper late, they don't forgive easily. They scorned me a few days ago, for nothing, they say sensationalistic. I saw it, I liked it. What does it matter when the boss doesn't like it. He knows his stuff. - He won't lose time with guys. - I know, I know. He's a bit jerks though. You're talking behing back? Give me a smile. That's right. It's nicer now. You're leaving behind the poor? I stayed far too long. Longer than I thought. We'll see each other. I'm in hurry, Janketa. You're in such a hurry. In general. You know how much I work. Television is hell. And poems? You see, poetry is planned as well. In which plan? Third? Tenth? - The first. You just don't undestand. Alright. Push while you can. And you? Why do you suffer here? Everyone's got their own taste and their own reasons. Besides, I'm studying. Easy. He's gone? - He's gone. I follow. - I follow as well. Three times. Mr Sreto say did they try something? They are trying of course, even with socialist sector. But it's not working. I respect deadlines. I give quality. I got sand three days ago. I made such auto parts better than all Fiat. What? What's going on? I want a card. Tell me Tomica if socialism is possible without private iniciative? - It isn't. - Of course it isn't. It's not my fault. I'm giving bother cheaper and better goods. Shut up mr Sveta and don't talk badly about socialism. Cause if I throw out at you a full of aces I'll take you your house and car and workshop. Who's talking badly? Me? God forbid. I live better than before the war. Honestly. 20. Easy, mister. Power is still in our hands. Three times. - Not in. - In. My daugther. I'm in. It's not good. I thought so. Why did you bring it? Come back. What's going on with you? What's going on? I asked you not to phone. Especially not during night. Except that... How are your studies going? What's with your girlfriend? She phones very often. When did she phone? Day before yesterday, yesterday, today. I saw Vojin. Your friend from faculty or from youth organization were looking for you. They ask if you're alive. Tell them I'm alive and that I pay membership regularly. What's that you won't tell me? You could see for youself. Do you want me to stop? Yes. You don't need me anymore. Nonsense. I'll phone you these days. Say you love me. Just me and nobody else. I have to believe while waiting. So nothing confuses me of what you're doing, of what's going on. Where am I in it, but really? Look how many are around us. I'm working like ass so nothing. Why should I wait? All those people around you. They work and ear. Is it a sin? They love you. I don't hate them. Everyone takes care of their own thing. That's all. Lets run away. Lets. If father found out, he'd stop playing with you. He's really protective? - He hates journalists. Except, you took him way too much money on cards. Alright, I'll return him the money. But I'll take something he cares about even more! To solve by political struggle issues that come about as a result of... I fell asleep, sorry. ...our material development in general. To follow what's going on in their own ranks and what's going on with their ideas. Who is Bozica? To lead a struggle for correct ideo-political... Vojin says his father is loaded. I don't care. What do you want from her? To sleep with daugther of a rich man. Just out of...spite. There comrades. Now you've heard how your basic authority is to be formed. If someone has something to say... - Here, me. Please. I'd like a few words. I looked over new rule book earlier and I've to say I'm not pleased on personal and principal basis. I'm interested if it's in defining the criteria our real achievement or something else important. Explain your thoughts! For example, I have 20 contrubutions a month, Taskalovic not even 10. But we have the same start basis. Did I write? - I apologize, comrade. I, actually we, shouldn't be interested in someone making good coverages in 1955. We're interested if he's making them today. That's the essence of new criteria. Petty interests or careers don't interest me. There's no place for sentimentality. Imagine, I found out. What? Kaca likes you. Who told you that? - She did. From the first day. How is she not ashamed? Why? She's older than you. Besides, she knows about the two of us. I can't believe, I thought she just respects me. Why did you sleep with her then? So? I'm thinking... she must be crazy. Why did you sleep with her? Stop talking nonsense. So you won't admit? Whatever, I'll admit it to you. You made up everything? - No. I cheated on you as well. I did, honestly. To hell with the laughter! Can't you see I'm talking? This isn't televesion but mental hospital. You don't know what you're doing anymore. You're behaving like some journalistic world-power. Go to hell with them. Comrade chef go to hell. - Yes. Then be kind, and come. You see, I've been following beginners generations for 17 years. And believe me I know paths of success and paths of failure. You were writing good from beginning, all the better, now you're writting badly, all the worse! You think it doesn't notice? You think redaction doesn't know I corrected your texts several times? That I let through unchecked data, constructed reportages? And protected you, finally? And when I have to say - pushed you! I neglected others because of you. Why did you do it? Did I ask you to? You know... there has to be a minimum of respect. That minimum exists. I beg you to stop abusing my afinity towards you. I beg you not to abuse my youth. If I heard well please, if you think, You're tired, lonley and boring. You're oldfashioned and bad journalist. Follower of the straight line and opportunist. Thanks to biography that starts with NOB and poetry, you exist like a ghost. People don't know what to do with you. You'd be driven to hinterland if you didn't have people to defend you. Whom you climbed into... - Stop you bastard, son of a bitch! You're taking place for some younger and better! Go, get out! I checked you. You can't fool me. Do you know all those reportages about floods? You said they are good, nothing special, and that reportage is my revenge. Whole text is a translation of old reportage by Reymond Cartier. A poet, an editor should know. But comrade Kaca has no idea. Perhaps she's heard of him but she has no idea. She can refuse Cartier cause that's her criterion for millions of viewers! It's better not to talk about respect too much. We'll see each other more Ivan. Our talk is not over. You're clear you have to write remaining part today. It's more simple that way. Alright if it's more simple. We've nothing to talk about then. I wanted to explain something. - I'm not interested. I wanted to prove how in redaction they claim I bring bad texts because of my private life. Undestand that this institution is not for personal fun. And if Kaca didn't know for Reymond Cartier that's different. But neither you or anybody else should behave like that. In whose name do you attack? Against who are you fighting? You want to solve generation problems? Should she go to make room for you? No way. If nothing else, she's got the same rights as you. She won't move as long as she's capable to work and fight. I know that this question is painful but But you'll see when you end up on street without pay of 100.000 without sinecura given here to study, write poems and work whatever and however you want. That poor 100.000... Every painter earns that for 2 days. My signature would worth more if there were cirteria. - Enough already! Here. Apply for scholarship as other students. Put me through with cabinet of comrade... - Get out! To public booth. We had enough of your calls and contacts. We're not afraid of them. Alright. Perhaps we won't see each other anymore. But we will hear. Besides, there's Communist Alliance. My organization should solve it. Yes, but it's not yours. How come it's not mine? - Not the way you think. I'd like to help you but I can't. I think you screwed it up. So find your own way... For now. We'll see later. I'll fix something. I'll fix myself. When I have to. I won't be neither the first nor the last. You're sleeping? No, I'm counting trees by the road. It seems Belgrade runs in front of us. I've no patience. It means you love it. - Yes. Sometimes. I love to return to it. Then drive faster. A person has been waiting for me for exactly 20 days. Are you pleased? I've got impression nobody's doing anything. Cause of silence. You're coming from television. You'll be editing our new edition 'The first steps'. You need to discover new talents. I hope you have will and sense. - Certainly. Of course, you won't decided alone. There's publishing council, collaborators. We'll consult each other. If it doesn't bother you. - My idea is... - You can occasionally ask me for advice. I, of couse, do not demand that. But I can help. I know something. Of course. Let me ask you for advice right away. I'm thinking about setting up a yearly award for the best young poet. I mean, beginner. You know, people like rewards and the house gets publicity. The thing is not new but it works. The work isn't done properly at all. Everything was done in hurry. Nothing works. Thin walls, crooked windows, bad furniture. I'm not pleased with accomodation at all. - Sleep. I'll keep an eye on watch. It's me. I read it. Much better. What? Separated? Of course. Faster! They are carefully spearated and lined. Listen to the names. Some Macura, from high school, so and so, two peasants from Svrljig peasants' surrealism What? I'm too tough? God forbid, I'm just being objective. You know, we can't print anything. Perhaps we can find something more. Two or three. Peasants are interesting. To get some sleep? On the contrary, I'm coming right away. Alright. Good bye. General director is on the trip, text might be with him. It not here as you can see yourself. I read it... I seem to remember... I don't come often, I live far... In a couple of days we'll see... - I beg of you. To be honest, I came here straight from the station. I brought excusion. Pupils are waiting for me. What can I do. What did you say? I brought children to museum and such. To see the capital city. You said straight from the station? - Yes. I couldn't hold on. Where do you actually come from? - From Zmijanje, I'm a teacher there. Wait a moment. Listen Stipetic I remembered in the meantime. I read your poems and I like them. I can say you'll become a great poet some day. I'll do everything for that. Comrades, let me inform you about decision of jury for honest lyricism tied to preoccupations of our contemporary lives we give this year's prize of 500.000 dinars to a young poet, teacher from village Zmijanje, Jakov Stipetic. Good evening. Lets go. I'm bored. Alright, leave. I'll stay. I've bussiness to attend to. May I know what more do you lack? A lot. You know I'm no editor and I'm just slacking it off. What are you then? I really don't know. I've got strength for 5 Ivans like this in me, undestand? I'm neither old nor tired. And the future we're all talking about is me, after all. Oh, hello. All is bollocks. I don't know really. You wanted to be a poet, but you're everything but that now. Why? You should go back to writing. I think so too. And I know what I wanted very good. I didn't forget it. Isn't it wet here? It should be aired. - It crammed comrade Stojanovic. We've no better rooms. Who managed to read all this? I don't know, believe me, but it comes every day. Over there is 1947. When the company was founded. Where is 1959, please? Behind the corner. Thank you. You can go now. I'll search myself. - Want some help? It's hard. No thanks, I'll search myself. Alright. Read it. These are the most beautiful verses you have ever heard. Are they? Who wrote them? Me. Old ambitions are coming back? That's good. I like that. - You know... I hope no publisher would dare to refuse Ivan Stojanovic. Not even you. Why not even me? Just because. I was joking. Where do you think to print it? Here. Why would I take it to other? I'm afraid we can't. Even if we could, I'm afraid it's not convenient. Whatever you want. I'll print it at the neighbours'. You'll be sorry when I win the prize this autumn. But we give the prize. - So what? If I earn it I'll get it. It's the only justice. May I ask something? Why did you marry? You don't know? I thought so. What are you doing whole day? I noticed you drink and gamble. Like your father. Why are you like that? You're saying what I could say to you. Okay, I checked. Council read it and gave a positive. I like your text very much. You know I honestly supported it. With a clear conscience. But... Yes, say... Why? Who says that? Dear colleague, I think it's the best thing I wrote. I'm amazed you prolong decision. I can give it to other, but I hope you... You can influnece them, try it, I'm keeping you on your word. Your novel over here is getting to the printers. You can count on me. Of course. Who's in your council? Give me their names. Even him? Give me next. You made it good. But nevertheless. I know a key for that lock. It'll soften up. Let me live! Honestly or dishonestly but my life! You won't let me grow up! You won't let me sleep. You won't let me work. I'm neither showman nor model. I've got my ambitions! You're the most boring man I met. I yearn for my friends. I'm different from them. I'm a man and they are drunks and slackers! They are human and you're monster. Then go to them. Go back where you came from. Go to hell! You go there. Besides... Where were you yesterday? It's my right to know. And where were you? - I was working. Unfortunately, I called you... You lie as usual. Alright. I'm turning different page starting tomorrow. We won't see each other. Great idea. You'll have enough time to run after presidents of quarts directors, and eventually state secretaries. You can court them and enjoy when they put their hand on your shoulder. Enough! YOUNG POET AWARDED NEW LITERARY NAME And wife? You forgot her? She lives with her father in another apartment. It's important I'm good. I'm not complaining. - You're a fool if you suffer that. That'd the deal. He doesn't ask me what I do. Yes, I know. He wants to make whore out of you. That's not marriage. But I'll fix it with him as I know it. I talked with mine. What are we going to do? It's almost gone. Continue while you have it! We'll get more! I made a mistake only once. I created him, I won't let him to make me a fool, do you understand? It's you. Did you wait long? We need to talk. Here. Father pushes for our divorce. He attacked me yesterday. - We're no longer married. Not only that. He's angry. He decided to destroy you. Imagine. I'm really interested in seeing how. He says he created you, raised you, invested too much in you. He's become unbearable. He keeps mentioning apartment, cars. One day he talked long about you. With Vojin. He's not happy either. He says you're not honest. That he made mistake. I'll return him the car, I'm getting a new one. He can't throw me out of apartment. What does he want then? He says you're the youngest jerk he knows. And that you're social problem. Tell him that he's pre-war devious turnaround with artificial jaw. And that I'm not afraid of him. It'd be good for Vojin to look his own bussiness and not cross my path cause... I'm sorry. I've got work. Anyhow, how do you live? So-so. And you? So-so. Then all's right. I've information that serious criticism's going to befall our house. We're being criticised for overspending. For wrong cultural politics, commercialism, etc. Unnecessary travels abroad are mentioned. Comrades, it's unfortunate that these attacks came about when comrade director is on a trip. But my obligation is to warn you. I'm ready to personally deny it all point by point. Especially if we see comrade Vojin as a whole. If we set aside small imperfections. Finally, everybody who work have right to make mistakes. Could it be more concretely? Concretely, they talk about qualified people coming to the head of our company. Writers, cultural workers and similar. You know that this workers' council set comrade Vojin for director, and that only he can replace it. I think it's our duty to talk about it. It's not about it, Vojin. - What is about then? You're just intriguing. I don't know what is it for. Whether we want it or not, there is a natural process. This time it's not either about me or you. What natural process? What are you talking about? I'm tired and old and you should replace me just because you're young? No. But cause I'm more productive. Productivity is a basis everthything else is measured by. Not everything, Ivan. Even it were so, you'd lose again. Besides, there's workers' council and collective and have them have their say. They are afraid of you. - Not true, I know those people for years. They are afraid of your success, respect and, if you want, your connections. You're lying! I was criticised countless times! They can replace me whenever they want and bring whoever they want. But watch out, I'm here just because so they don't bring someone like you. I know you if they don't. From the first day. And not only you. But whole little army of such bastards. I lie, rebels. Revolutionaries that can be bought for handful of thousands. I'll be the watch that won't let revolution fail for suckups and thieves. Nice excuse. I'm not against you being the watch. But I'm against you being director of publishing company. Simply, you're not qualified. I'm not even 50 years old. What'd you want? I wasn't fighting only for you but for me as well. I want the right to work too! You want to keep your armchair. Say it openly so we could part ways like people. To hell with the armchair, sit in it if you want to! I will personally suggest you for director, But watch out I'll stay in company. Even as a simple worker. And I'll cut you down. I'll fight against you. I'll criticise you on every step. I'll turn everything, all forums, the whole publich against you. You'll see who's who then. I didn't want to be damned watch but I'll use my right and be one. I will, you know. What is it? Do you accept fight or not? Aren't you scared? No, Vojin. I was never scared of you. Shut up. It funny. I'm allowed to laugh? That over there is graveyard. So stop it. Look. I don't know how it happened. I really don't. Why this crazy... I think about whether she was brave or coward. What made her do it? Would she do it if I that night... What is it again? Emergency talk. - You're coming only with bad news. Come on, talk. Father is arrested. You're lying. Why? He's accused for tax evasion. That's true. He earned millions. We have to save him Ivan. I don't know how, where to begin. How to save him when he's guilty? We have to help him. At least, try to. Where are his friends? Find them, perhaps they can do something. I don't know. - Me even less. I can only spoil it. Come on. Don't lose time. But I don't know, you have to help me. - I can't, I won't compromise myself. You had benefits Ivan, how can you? It's of no use to try to talk me into it. Listen to me, I've nothing to do with you or him! Somebody could come, it'll look like I'm involved in that vulgar theft. I won't! You can't leave me, you're still my husband! Good evening. Good evening. Misery! I forbade you to call upon my name now or ever! I'm nobody's husband! I've no idea! Go away! Get lost when I tell you! Get lost! Get lost! Did you inform her parents? You're her husband as far as I know? Comrade Stojanovic, I'm sorry but I'll have to disturb you with a few questions. Tell me, what do you think what are the reasons for suicide? Or you think it's not suicide? No. Actually yes, I think it's suicide. You see, I'm very busy. At the moment, I'm replacing director of large publishing company... - We know about you, we're interested in your wife. I know little about her. Unfortunately, less then I should. We haven't been living together for months, almost a year. Last time, last night, she came to me. Arrest of her father disturbed her greatly. Alright, how long am I going to wait? You promised to support me. I...wait... wait... I've no longer have patience. False roads they put under my feet false words they put into my mouth my life is full of lies ears are full Up to throat in horrible lie suffocating me. All which is mine has false sound All which is mine is like made of smoke lie is supported by false witnesses no one nowhere is interested in truth. So... Now say why you came. For a little favor. Very little. What? To find Dragana. I know you're seeing her. I hear they're cutting you down in newspapers. For what you're guilty and for what you aren't. As it usually goes. You have to ask her to see me again. I have to tell her some more things. I don't know, Ivan. I don't like to mix in that. Please. It's really important. Besides, I'm leaving. I think it's high time to get lost out of Belgrade. Old lady died, you know? My mother is calling me. She says 'Son, there's no money', 'You know yourself it's not easy', 'We barely make the ends meet'. So you don't want. I don't know. Keep up, old guy. At least you always knew what you wanted. Say it shortly and surely am I guilty? If you say...then... What then? Then I'll do something. Tell me, what? You know I'm among those who can. Suddenly. Alright. Then you're guilty. And not only for her. So then you agree with others? I don't know. I think so. Repeat. You have to be sure. You want to soften me up. I want you to be sure. I sure, then? Alright. Then watch. What's with the comedy? Once more, am I guilty or not? You're guilty, don't bother me. It's going rather slow, isn't it? I think you should put the noose around your neck first. It's not going to work otherwise. When you leave bring your sweater. It's on the rock over there.
