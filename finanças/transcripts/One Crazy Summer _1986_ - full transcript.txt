Hi. ♪ Saturday night ♪ ♪ At the corner cafe... ♪ Once upon a time, there was a lonely kind of a guy who'd resigned himself to the fact that love was blind. Now, if love is blind he thought to himself. How will it find me? It honestly seems such a crime. For how many times has love knocked on the door... ...when it should have been knocking on mine? And so one day, he went off in search of the aloof creature. He soon happened upon the cute and fuzzy bunny gang. Perhaps, they could help him. Uh, pardon me, cute and fuzzy bunnies. He said. I wonder if you could help me find love. Love would have nothing to do with such a stupid looking creature. Said the first cute and fuzzy bunny. With that nose and those shoes. And that stomach. And those eyes. And those ears. Roses are red, violets are blue but love will have nothing to do with you! They chanted and danced around him. Naturally, our hero was very saddened by this so... um... he... Actually, uh, he... He reached into his suitcase and pulled out a Israeli submachine gun and he, he sawed those cute, fuzzy bastards in half with hot lead! Oh-ho! It was beautiful! Wait, stop! No, no. It's supposed to be a love story not a "Rambo" bloodbath. Forget it. It's not your fault. It's me. Hey, Morty, how am I gonna get this done? What do you know? You're not a man. You're a cat. Go back to your feline world. Get outta here. You better get a move on, Hoops. You'll miss graduation. Okay, mom. Here's your cap and gown. All clean. What do you mean, "All clean?" Hoops, these are rented. Do you know how many people wear them? I washed them. Rita Segal. Solomon Shapiro. Frank Stephens. Shirley Storm. I gotta get out of Generic this summer or I'm gonna lose my mind. Hoops, come to Nantucket with me. We'll have a blast. We'll scale mermaids. No, I can't be goin' to bein' a party monkey, George. I gotta buckle down. I've got two weeks to submit my scholarship assignment. It's the only chance I'm gonna get to get into Rhode Island School of Design. Come on, Hoops, it's the summer. We're high school graduates now. I mean, it's time to reap the rewards of four years of hard, grueling, mind-expanding work. What's this word? Your last name. Oh, yeah. Georgina Williams. The scholarship assignment is supposed to be an illustrated love story. What do I know about love? How am I supposed to write a good love story? I've never been in love. I would like to congratulate the 1986 graduating class of Generic New York High School! - Honey, you like it? - Oh, daddy, it's great. It's just what I wanted. I think what you really need is a break from your mom. I mean, what, you're gonna end up bein' a... ...a street cleaner because you didn't get your basketball scholarship? Yeah, I guess she's just takin' it hard, right? Of course she is. I mean, it's like my mom saying I'm an irresponsible louse. I mean, I know that she knows I'm not irresponsible. I mean, your mother still has faith in you, Hoops. I mean, just because you can't play basketball worth of shit, doesn't mean you got no other option in life. I guess you're right. There you go. And nothin' proves that more than bein' surprised with your brand new graduation wheels. That final, parental confirmation that you're going somewhere in life. And this is just the vehicle to take you there. Nantucket, huh? When can we leave? Just gotta pick up my sister. And, Hoops, uh, remember never say anything about her dog. ♪ Be cruel to your school ♪ ♪ 'Cause you may never get another ♪ ♪ Be cruel to your school ♪ ♪ In the name of rock 'n' roll ♪ ♪ Be cruel to your school... ♪ Okay, you've gotta go.

It's mine! - Who are your friends? - Maniacs! Get us out of here! Go, go, go! Hurry up! They're gaining on us! - Hi. - Hi. - Who are you? - I'm Cassandra. - Good. - George. Pleasure's all mine. Watch where you're going! We're heading for the docks! We gotta make the boat. - Boat? What boat? - What? You think we're driving to Nantucket? Come on, it's an island! You never mentioned any boat. I hate boats. I'm not gettin' on any boat. I beg to differ. What are you doing? It's already left! We'll make it. - We'll make it? - We'll make it.

Now! ♪ You're history and this is why ♪ ♪ You're just a dog ♪ This is gonna be a great summer. I want you to die! Once upon a time, there was a lonely kind of a guy on a quest for love. The cute and fuzzy bunnies were quick to cooperate this time. The path they sent him on landed him on an ocean-going vessel. Now, our hero hated boats but he was desperate in his quest. And once again he fell victim to the heinous cute and fuzzy bunnies. And he was sucked into the cold, dark sea and he never found love. Are you alright? Me? Yeah, great. Really good. Why? I don't know, you look pretty uncomfortable. What, a-are you afraid of water? No. No, not really. No. Well, yeah. Yeah, actually, I am afraid of the water. But, uh, this is a big boat. A lot of safety equipment. And I can see the land. Clean, fresh air. Chili dog. Go away. You live on the island? Just for the summer, I'm going over to help my grandfather out. What kinda help? Well, he's got a houseful of friends he's taking care of, and... He's having money problems. I was working in some dive tryin' to help him out but I got ripped off. Is that what that was about, the big scene back there? - Yeah. - Hm. I wish I could've helped out more. Oh, come on, you were great. You sure? Last bite. Will you get out of here with this? Hey, you kids! Come on! This gonna be, this is gonna be fun. All the eggs, they're broken! Argh! Clay, I-if you're not gonna stand on the right side you're like defeating the entire purpose of even buying them, you big mess! Mess! Argh! There they are. The Stork twins. Those guys? They're twins? Yeah, Clay's a couple minutes older. Yo! The Stork twins! This is Hoops. Aloha! Hi, Hoops! I'm gonna go get the car. Hey, Squidly! Hey, this is gonna be a great shot. I'm out. Maybe we'll see each other. - Hope so. - Alright. - Take it easy. - Yeah, you too. Hey, Stork guys! - Hi, Hoops. - What's happening? - How do you do? - Hi. I-it's very, it's very... - Nice to meet you. - Yeah. Me too. What's going on here? What's with the big fish? Oh, they're shooting the sequel to that movie "Foam" here. Yeah, about, about the giant dolphin with rabies that terrorizes a small New England town. Wow. We're gonna work part-time as security guards on the set. - Stork twins! - Argh! - Clay! - O-ow. So, what, you guys got the day off from the garage? - W-w-we're doing a job. - Doing a job. - We're pickin' up a boat. - Pickin' up a boat. Whose boat is it? - His. - His. You touched my car. What? You touched my car! Right! Well, let me just get it clean, then! You touched it again! Don't ever touch my car again, ever, ever! Don't touch my car ever, ever again! Teddy, honey... ...can we go pick up your boat? Ever! Remember? Your new boat? Ty, bring in the Stork twins! Come here. Ow! Boy, I wouldn't have come, anyways. - Ow. Ow, ow. - Now, move that tow truck! Let's go! Hustle! Uh, my shoe! That is some tuna. Grammy, the high school graduates are here. Oh! Look who it is. Grammy! My pride and joy. There's my little girl. Look what grammy bought for you. Would you like some nice milk and cookies? Come on, your grammy will show you where you go... Nice meeting you too. She's nuts about me. Oh, yeah. Come on, you gotta meet my Uncle Frank. One million dollars. This is it. We guarantee it. This is your summer to win! Keep it here and listen for this jingle. 95.5 FM. Music money time. If you, yes, you are our fiftieth caller... One million dollars is all yours! That's right. Hey, Uncle Frank. Georgie? Georgie! - What are you doin' in here? - Still at it, huh? My God, Would you get out of here? What do you think? I'm playing games? I need to be left alone! Why don't you just leave me alone? Every summer he sits there trying to win that radio show. Every summer he loses a little bit more of his mind. Why don't they just leave me alone with my dream? Okay. There. Now, Billy, take this to the back room. Field strip it. Careful with that thing! Boys, tourniquet! - Calamari. - Mr. Raymond. Thought you'd be in prison by now. What can I do for you? We're looking for Acky. Uh, this is my friend, Hoops McCann. Quit monkeying with that thing! Sorry. Well, another wasted summer, huh, boys? Why don't you go in with Acky? Just think of it. Death from above! Airborne! Excuse me if I'm wrong, sir but, uh, Acky throws up on the Ferris wheel at the children's park. You've got no college acceptance, George. You've got no direction with your lives. No, no plan. When there's no plan, there's no attack. And no attack, there's no victory. This! This is what makes men, men. I'll have to pick one up. Anyway, where's Acky? Oh, he's out on a mission for his old man. - A mission, sir? - Yeah. He's on the beach, collecting shells. Well, that's a little bit more like Acky's speed. Acky, what are you doing? George, take cover! Your dad said you were collecting shells. Shells. Fifty seven millimeter. My dad gets 12 bucks a piece for them. They make great paperweights. Hi, I'm Ack Ack. Let's get outta here. Come on, over the top, boys! Nobody lives forever! Oh, my God! You could've waited till they were done bombing the beach, I mean, come on. When the man says go, you go. You could have been killed. Oh, my God! Do you realize for every lost, mangled doll there's a little girl with a broken heart? Sure you wanna be a marine, Acky? I mean, I just don't see you having the killer instinct. "He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death..." What's going on? "Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life." Oh, for God's sake! Excuse me for just one... Uh... Leave me. So, old man Eldridge finally kicked, eh, Ted? Doin' my laps, dad. Ted, I would like to have a word with you. In a minute, dad. Ow! I'll try not to take up too much of your time. Okay, okay. Are you ready for the regatta, Ted? Yeah, sure, I'm ready. The new sloop's a beauty. I can't lose. If you screw it up this year you and I are out... Hi, daddy. - Hi, grandpa. - How are you? Good. If you screw it up this year, Ted that decaying old man your grandfather takes everything away. Do you understand, Ted? If you don't come home with that trophy we lose it all. No more pools. No more Ferrari. And do you know what happens then, Ted? Don't say it, dad. That's right, Ted. You'll have to go to... - No! No, dad. Don't say it. - Work, Teddy, work! Don't say that word, please! I'll win. Just don't say that word! That's why I need this Eldridge land. With this land, I can finally start building Beckerstead Estates. And that crazy old man can't... - Hi, daddy. - Hi, grandpa. Have a wonderful day. That crazy old man can't hold that race over my head every year. Now, Ted... ...what did you find out about this place? Oh, Chong says he left it to his granddaughter. She's got one week to pay the back mortgage. And, dad, I've seen this girl. She's a... She's a real hippie type. She wears, like, these braids. What do they call them, cornhusks? If she don't get the money you get the house. They're already doing the paperwork. Wonderful. Wonderful. This will be my most beautiful restaurant yet. I used to come down here with him all the time. Your grandfather sounded like he was a really nice man. I'm really sorry. Old Mr. Peckerhead's been trying to... - Who? - Beckerstead. He's been trying to drive grandpa out of that house since I was a baby. I guess he finally got him. So what's gonna happen, I mean, to the house and all his friends, what are they gonna do? The bank's given me one week to come up with the back mortgage of three thousand dollars. It might as well be a million. You know I just can't let those people be thrown out on the streets. I just wish I had more time. I wish I could help. I'm not gonna give up. I figure that I can sell some of the furniture and I'm, I'm gonna do some clubs. You sing? Yeah, I try. Cool. I bet you're really great. Thanks. I guess basketball is your thing with a name like Hoops. Yeah, it's kinda in the family blood, you know? My dad was really great. But I wanna do something a little more challenging. A little different. So I figure I'm gonna try to get a scholarship to art school. What do you draw? Nothing, lately. I'm in kind of a rut. Draw me something? Okay. What can I get for you? I don't know. Um... How about a gorilla? Or me, or, um... No, how about a gorilla and me? You and a gorilla. Okay, so... Okay. boing boing Uh, lose the nose. Fix that, and... change the feet. Best I could do with short notice. It's great. If this is what you do second best I'd love to see you play basketball. It's quite a sight, let me tell you. Thanks for cheerin' me up. My pleasure. Well, I better go. Yeah, me too. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Maybe you can come by later. Okay. Bye. Cassandra! Cassandra, can you help me a minute?' Could you help me out? I-I'm stuck. One million dollars. It could happen at any time, any day any hour, any minute, any second! We're giving away one million dollars and it could happen now, right now! But it's not going to happen yet. So keep listening for this jingle 95.5... To win one million dollars! Whoa, whoa! Hey, Egg! Really smart. What if that went in my eye? Argh! Hey, where's Hoops? Uh, he went over, he went over there. You guys better look after him, man. He's got a tendency to wallow in his artistic miseries, if you know what I mean. Yeah. Hey, Egg, uh, cut me a little shade, will you? Okay, thank you. Excuse me, excuse me. Hey, little boy, will you hold on to this for me? Thank you very much. - Argh! - Mommy? - Sorry. - Mommy! Jimmy? Jimmy! Mommy! - Hi, Hoops. - Hi. Hoops, how about a brew? Thanks, guys. That's good. Oh, please, Mr. Dog, don't. What are you doing? Nothing much, guys. H-Hoops, if you run out of things to draw you can draw us, you know, heh. Yeah, like, you could draw us nude. Yeah, yeah, bare naked with no clothes on! No, no, button up! Button up! Thank you. I appreciate that. But I'll come up with something. Oh, look, I-I offer you my body a-a-and... And now I'm the jerk of the world or something. It was a nice gesture. Hi. I met you at the docks yesterday. Hello. Hi, I'm Hoops. Cookie. - How's it going? - Great. Alright, uh... These are the Stork twins. - Hi, Cookie. - She's Cookie. Hi, Cookie. I'm Egg. Gemini! I know them. They work for my boyfriend. What can I do for you? My friends and I are gonna go sailing and we were wondering if you and your friends could help us get our boat in the water? Ah, well, what do you say, fellas? Can we help these lovely ladies get their boats in the water? No, no, I'll tell you what, I-it sounds like work. Hoops, Hoops, boats are heavy. I'll get a hernia. Guys, come on, come on, let's do it. - Would you guys get up? - Argh! Sure. Love to. - Great. - What kinda boat you have? Well, you got anything else we can do for you like, maybe, shovel your driveway or somethin'? You guys! Hey! Hey, you guys! Do you have anything, like, heavier we could carry? - Like a car? - Guys! Oh, yeah, sure, like, forsake me for eight chicks. Come on, hey! Sir? Wait, no! Mister, please! Please, sir! No, y-y-you don't understand. I've had a bad day. Do you want to come sailing? There's room for one more. No. Really, I can't. I, I don't like boats. You're not afraid, are you? No, of course not. I just got a lot to do, you know, on the beach. How about a movie, then? - What about your boyfriend? - He's going to a reception. I'll pick you up at 8:00. ♪ Down on the corner ♪ ♪ I'll be in the street ♪ ♪ Willy and the poor boys are playin' ♪ ♪ Bring a nickel tap your feet ♪ ♪ Rooster hits the washboard ♪ ♪ And people just gotta smile ♪ Oh, come on, have a heart, dude. Oh, no, not those. Oh, no! Oh! Please, Your Enormousness, anything, but chili! She really likes you! Too bad George wasn't here to see that, huh, Hoops? - George! - George! - He ain't far out. - Dead man on the beach! Chili? Phil, do the CPR. - You do it. - No. I have seniority. I want you to give him CPR. Phil, give him CPR! George was alive, just barely. Nobody wanted to perform CPR on him so it was a complete nightmare. But enough about old George. So, how's the dollar count comin'? You get any more money? So far so good. I sold some of the furniture. And I have a gig tonight at a club called the Dew Drop Inn. Maybe you can come by. Yeah, sure. I-I mean I'll try. I-I might have something to do tonight maybe. Oh, well, if you can. Be nice to have a friend there. I'll be there. I'll be at the first table. You can count on it. I got to go. George's grandma is makin' us supper. You know how grandmas are about that kind of thing. This kinda means the world to 'em. Are you sure you don't want just a little bit more? No, thank you. I'm stuffed. It was delicious, though. Well, alright, then. I got it. - Keep it. - Thank you very much. - Thank God. - It was really good. So, uh, what do you mean you're not goin' out with Cookie tonight? You're here to write a love story, Hoops. Cookie is a love story. George, have you seen her boyfriend? He's like Cro-Magnon teen. No way. Besides, I said I was gonna help Cassandra. I promised I'd go to her show. Yeah, but like-like Cookie asked you out first. W-we were there. Y-you know, Teddy's not even gonna be around tonight, Hoops. You know where Teddy's gonna be? He's gonna be at a little reception celebrating the rape of the land that Cassandra's house now stands on. - The Stork brothers told me. - That's true! You know, Cookie seems like a real nice person. Maybe she'd like to help Cassandra out. I don't think that's what she's interested in. You know what I mean? Ha, come on, Hoops. Quit thinkin' about yourself all the time. I mean, go out with Cookie... ...and, uh, get her on your side. And then go see Cassandra. Mm, think I'd rather keep all the original bone structure of my face, okay? - Do you want to help Cassandra? - Of course. Well, listen, the Stork twins are going to the reception after work. If Teddy, say, does anything... ...they'll call me at the drive-in and, uh... ...the big guy will be watchin' your back. Trust me. Once upon a time there was a happening kind of a guy who'd stumbled onto a girl who embodied all that love should be. All seemed well. Maybe, those cute and fuzzy bunnies weren't so bad after all. Until... Her boyfriend showed up and pounded him into something that resembled a wet prune. Ouch. Never! Never! Never! Never! Never! Never! Never! I am going to die. Forget about it. - Where're you goin'? - I'm going to see Cassandra. Baby. Are you ready for me, Hoops? Hey, wait a minute. Pull over. I know her. Hey, you need a ride? - That was a friend of mine. - I don't pick up hitchhikers. Ha! Oh, the humanity! Thank you very much for the ride. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Hey, Clay! Clay! Clay! Hi. Hi. I didn't hear you come in. Uh-uh, I have to come here and then relieve you 'cause dad needs you right now, pronto at the gas station! Okay, b-but, Egg, don't forget a-at 9:00 you have to be at the Beckersteads. Watch Teddy, if anything weird is goin' on call George at the drive-in right away. We can't let Hoops down. Okay.

The shock and the horror of-of what just happened will surely impair their judgment. You must do the thinking in order to save them. In this case, a plane has just crash-landed on this point.

Here you go. - Hi. - Hi, Hoops. - How're you doing? - Fine. - Look, Cassandra... - Ah, here you go. I wanted to apologize. I... I never should've said I was a basketball player.

Nantucket's big news tonight is Cassandra Eldridge live at the Dew Drop Inn. Come on, come on, come one, come on. Well, good luck to her and good luck to you in our $1 million summer. It could happen at any minute. - You could win $1 million. - Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on. Stand still, Teddy. Come on, dad, I gotta do my laps. I have not yet mastered this contraption. When I have, then you may continue your laps. Damn it. Do you know who this is, Ted? - No. - That... is trouble. That is the girl that just might ruin my restaurant on the bluff. She's singing or something tomorrow night. If people do actually show up to hear her she might make some money. She might make enough to pay back the bank. What are we going to do about it, Ted? Hm? Uh, stop her from singing? Good, Teddy. Good. Get it. W-we're here to pick up your father's Jag. H-he called us. We will need the keys. Ha! Ow. - Get rid of this. - Okay. Come on. In sports, we've got the Nantucket Regatta coming up. and Cape Cod's own Mr. Congeniality... - Hi, guys. - Hi, Ack Ack. - How you doin'? - Well... that's the last of it. I'm history. I just wish I could make my father understand. Hey, Ack... ...I understand. - You do? - Uh-huh. Let me tell you a story... ...about a little fat boy... that nobody loved and then all the other kids, they used to make fun of him... ...and they would pick on him. And they, and they, and then they used to say that he talked funny and stuff. And he had a, and he had a twin brother and everybody, a-a-and everybody said that he didn't look anything like his twin brother. B-but he wanted to. Egg... Were you the little fat boy? No. No. B-but I used to like to beat him up, you know? I'd grab him and go, "Why are you so fat?" "Why are you so fat?" and I'd beat the shit out of him. Isn't that a great story? Yeah. Thanks. - Are you a little nervous? - Uh-unh. - No? - Nobody's gonna show up. Come on, everybody's gonna show up. It's the greatest media blitz in the history of Nantucket. It's gonna be great and I don't wanna hear another word. What about Beckerstead? Do you think he's gonna pull something? It's covered, okay? I promise you. You just relax and have a good time 'cause you're gonna be great. I know you are. Okay? trust me. Hoops... I just, um, want to tell you... I guess I know what you mean. - Hoops? - Yeah. Got to run. See you at the club. This one's for Cassandra. Go! Go! Go! Hey! Ha! Ha! Teddy! Don't forget about tonight! Dad, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go. I'll go after I do my laps! Thank you, Teddy! Ah!

What? I'm sorry, miss. But I'm afraid all the money in the world isn't going to get you that house. But it's my house and that's the money that I owe you. I understand, miss. The problem is Mr. Beckersted has bought the mortgage from the bank and he can foreclose anytime he wants. - You gave me until today. - I am sorry. But the bank was as lenient as it could be for as long as it could be. What about those people? That's their home! How could you sell it to him? Mr. Beckersted is a lot wealthier than you. What's goin' on? What happened? What does it matter? The house is theirs. That's right. And get this ugly mutt off my property. Boscoe! Dr. Bolson to ER. Dr. Bolson Squid, it's okay. Boscoe's gonna be just fine. I don't know, they've been in there a while. I think I smell gas too. Cassandra, are you really gonna leave? Why should I stay? There's nothing left here for me. How can you say that? I mean, come on! How can you say that? What about the house? What about all those people? We're just gonna give them to the Beckersteds? I mean we can't let those people walk away with everything. I mean, if we give in to those people we're giving in to all the cute and fuzzy bunnies in the world. Yeah, yeah, that's just what I was thinking. Wh-what I mean is, we-we can't give up. Gotta think of a plan. Plan, plan... Without a plan, there's no attack. Without attack, no victory. Where have I heard that before? A plan... Oh, boy, I've got a plan. Acky's got a plan. What is it? - The regatta. - The regatta? You know, the, the regatta. The, the-the sailing boat race. The one boat rowing, sailing, motoring regatta around Nantucket. Your planning involves a boat? But Teddy's gonna win it. He wins every year. Everybody knows that. Exactly, but what happens if he doesn't win? Well, his grandfather takes away everything he and his father own. Basically making his life as dreary as ours. Poor guys. - And? - So, we win the race. He can't live without the trophy. We can't live without the house. We make a trade. Great, Ack Ack. There's just one thing missing. The boat. The boat! Sh-she's in really good shape. Mind you, she could use a little help. George? I'd like to welcome you all to the christening of the boat. And for this gala occasion I got a little somethin' that my parents brought me back from their trip to France. I've been saving it for a special occasion. I think this is it. - Ohh! - Whoa! Ooh. Oh! That's really nice! Cassandra, would you do the honors? - Hey! - Yeah. To the boat? To the boat! We'll just patch that up. We'll fix that later. Well, listen, Hoops here's a little something from all of us to-to all of you. What? For me? What is it? Oh, man! Thank you! What is this for? What do you... Well, a captain has to have his captain hat. Ah, I can't accept this. Acky, why don't you be captain? This was your idea. This has been decided, Hoops. You're the man for the job. I can't be captain. I'm not even gonna be on the boat. I'm gonna be on the land. I'm sorry, fellas. Uh, Hoops? Uh, what do you guys say we have a look at the engine, huh? - Yeah. - Sure, that'll be great. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I just don't like boats. I hate boats! Since I was a kid I don't like boats. Maybe you just haven't had the right kind of experience on a boat. Maybe you're right. Well, then, I mean, that's it, boys. I don't know, guys, we gotta have an engine for part of this race. I'll get it. I mean most of those guys are gonna have you know like Evinrudes and Mercuries. Heavy stuff. I don't think this puppy's gonna cut the mustard. Well, that's like the best my dad had, you know? Hey! What happened? T-Teddy brought his car in for a tune up. Did he hit you? A-a-h!

How you doin'? McCann... Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Nantucket Regatta. Part of the regatta will test your strength and stamina. On this line, you will... You... You will not... Get down! Come here. Go! Go! Go! Go! Come on, save it for the race. - Acky! - Save it for the race! There, you will drop your sails and start your engines for the final stretch back into Nantucket Harbor. Now... if everyone is ready. Go! Don't stop, come on! Go! Go! Go, go, go, go! - Hey, Egg! - What? Tito Ramirez is wrestling Mr. Congeniality in a half hour. Teddy says Mr. Congeniality doesn't have a chance. Go! Come on! Go! Go! Come on, guys! They're gaining on us. We'll take care of this right now! Dad? Oh, shit! You just steer the boat, you stupid, imbecilic retard! You're not my son! I knew I couldn't trust you to do this without me. What are you doin'? First, we just take out that halyard. This race is yours! Aw, come on, dad. I can win. Shut your mouth, Teddy! That's an order. Shit, what happened? Now... you may proceed. The halyard snapped. Aye! It cou-couldn't have just snapped. Look... You bastards! Fix that Australian boat. Well, there-there goes Cassandra's house. Well, that's that. Come on, we can't quit! We gotta do somethin'. Think! But we gotta get the halyard back up there through the halyard holder. We can't do that out here! We're not dead yet! Man, we're gettin', we're gettin' smoked! What are you doin', Hoops? Desperation move! - Wow! - Two points! - Ty! Take out the main sheet! - Yeah! Come on! Yeah, go, go! Fly! Man overboard! Jesus! Drop the sail, fellas. Acky! - God! - Ack! Hold on, buddy. We'll be there in a minute. Alright! Acky! Go on! I got him! Are you sure? I got him. Beat it. Go! Let's do it. Go get those scum, mates! Come to me. Help me, boys! Check this out. I don't believe it! Aloha! We're back! How are ya? Ha-ha! Teddy, get this thing going faster. Aw, come on, dad. The wind's dying down. We're almost to the engine buoy. I'm not taking any chances. Dad, damn it. Why don't you ever listen to me? I can win! The only way to win, Theodore, is to cheat. Remember. A little hole in their hull will slow them down just enough. Oh my God, he's lost his mind. Get down! Oh! What the hell is that? Teddy! Come back here! Come back here, right now, boy! - Teddy! - Oh my God. - Teddy... - A giant dolphin with rabies. Come back here! Teddy! Theodore! Teddy! Come back here! Help me! No! Teddy! Uh, come on, guys, the wind's coming up. Let's set sail, let's get outta here. Oh, boy, if I ever get outta this. I'm gonna make you into a stew. Help me... ...somebody! Somebody help me! Alright! There's the engine buoy! There's the bouy! There's the bouy! Ahh! Yeah! - Come on, let's go! - Alright! Come on, let's get outta here. Hustle it down! Come on. Move it, move it, move it! Come on, ladies! Let's go! Alright! Let's get out of here. Alright, start up the engine! Good luck trying to beat a Merc with a lawnmower engine. Alright, come on! Gentlemen! Prepare to blow the hatch! Whoo! Gentlemen, I am blowing the hatch! Come on, Teddy! Step on it, man. I got her at full throttle, she doesn't have anymore. What the hell have they got in that thing? My car. Thank you very much. Bye bye. Bye-bye. See you later! Woo-hoo! I'd like to thank everyone that made this possible! Hey, Cookie. Why don't we quit playing all these games? Yes! Ah, look what I caught! How you doing? Are you hurt? Squid, Squid, look at that. Boscoe! - Thanks again, mate. - You're welcome. I heard what you did, Ack Ack. It's all over the island. You're a hero. And I'm proud of ya, son! Damn proud! I want you to... come home. Does this mean I have to give back the bazooka? Well... let's talk about it over a hot chocolate. Hey, Teddy! What do you say me and you, we make a little deal? You need the trophy and we need the house. And everybody's happy. Come on, Ted. Okay. You're only half right, McCann. That house isn't gonna do you or your father any good. I'm not gonna put a dime in the Beckersted Estates. This is the real investment, Teddy. Friendship! Here's your house back! Thank you so much! The little lady has quite a voice. Come on, Teddy. Ow! Once upon a time, there was a happy guy that love finally found. And this time, love didn't pass him by. Old boy finally caught a break! This love story lasted all summer long. And there was nothing even the cute and fuzzy bunnies could do about it. Thank you. There's a bomb, there's a bomb! Come on, get up, get up, come on. 95.5 FM... Music-money time. This is it, we're looking for caller number 50! Good luck! You're on the air! - Hello? - Hello! Hello. This is the contest at the radio station? I hope you're sitting down because you won $1 million dollars! Jesus Christ, I won! - Oh, thank you so much! - It's all yours! This changes everything for me. Look. You don't know anything!
