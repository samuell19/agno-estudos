WOMAN: Don't be disgusting. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Kishka? Thanks. So, this guy goes to the doctor, and he says, "Doc." What kind of doctor? What? What kind of doctor? A specialist or what? Oh, David. He's a urologist. Now are you happy? It makes it more realistic. Detail, Kenny. Okay? Grandma, what are pickles made of? Dad, I write comedy. I know what makes things funny. So show us. I was trying to. Will you let him talk? Pickles come from cucumbers, sweetheart. KEN: So this guy goes to his urologist and he says, "Doc, I'm having a little trouble. "I'm not functioning the way I used to. You know, it's my..." Not in front of the children. Penis. Right. Right you are, honey. MOLLY: Is that Hope's face? Look at it. Does that face belong to Hope or what? So the doctor says, "No problem. We can fix you right up. You have a choice. "There's this little device with a hand pump. Cost you about $400. "Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. There's no guarantee. "But we also have a second choice. "It's this incredible, state-of-the-art..." Can you pass the mustard, please? MOLLY: Oh, here. Have some fries, honey. You look thin. Have some coleslaw. No, no thanks, Grandma. I'm fine. Leave him alone, Molly. He's an adult. He can take care of himself. Sue me. I care about Alan's health. Can somebody help me light this? Not indoors, sweetheart. Grandma, where do cucumbers come from? KEN: Excuse me. From the ground. Excuse me, am I in the middle of a story here or am I on some kind of an acid flashback? Just tell the story, honey. Please, Uncle Kenny. I'm limp with suspense. KEN: Have a pickle. It may help. So the doctor says, "We also have "this incredible, state-of-the-art, museum-quality gizmo "that we install internally, and all you have to do is press a button. "And bingo, satisfaction guaranteed." Is this a joke? Nothing's funny. You say this is the urologist talking? Yeah. Sparkler, please. Molly, it's the Fourth of July. Come on. Is it all right with you, Annie? Just be careful, Audrey. Okay? Come on, sweetie. You hold it up. There you go. So the guy says, "How much is this going to set me back?" And the doctor says, "$75,000." And the guy says, "Wow. I gotta go home and discuss this with the wife." So he does, and he comes back the next day and he says, "the wife and I have discussed it, and we've decided..." We'd rather renovate the kitchen. I heard it already. (CHUCKLES) Look, magic fire. Okay, all eyes here. Who wrote this? William Shakespeare? Good, Shawna. And the form is? Danny? I don't know. It doesn't make any sense to me. Take a closer look. Well, I like each of the lines and they seem to make sense, but the whole thing doesn't add up. Excellent! (MIMICS BUZZER) You win the all-expense-paid trip to Atlantic City! Danny hit it right on the nose. I took seven couplets from seven different sonnets and put them all together. They're all Shakespeare, they're all beautiful, but all together they make no sense. So, what does this tell us? Never trust Shakespeare. (LAUGHING) Yeah, sort of. Never trust a brand name just because it's in the "great books" section. And? "To thine own self be true." Exactly. Trust your own judgment. Trust your own instincts. Use your own eyes and ears. That's what they're there for. And never end a sentence in a preposition, which is what I just did. (CHUCKLING) (BELL RINGING) He's kind of rugged looking. He's got a full head of hair. That's always a bonus. But is he married? No. This one is divorced. I think you'll really, really like him. Oh, I already have one blind date this week. Well, it's perfect. You can wear the same outfit. ALAN: Lobster Thermidor again? You want lobster Thermidor? You make it yourself. I've got a million recipe books from my good little wifey days. Maybe I don't wanna be a good little wife. I don't blame you. I didn't either. So, you got a date for the prom? Do you? Don't deflect. You ask anyone? Maybe. Not yet, huh? I'm narrowing my prospects. (TELEPHONE RINGING) Yeah, well, better narrow fast. You've got exactly... 24 days. Yeah, I know. Hi, mom. What's up? No, it's okay. We're not dining formally this evening. I'm not talking with my mouth full. It's only half full. I'm great. I'm doing great. How's my social life? What can I say? I'm doing a lot of field work. I am not picky, mom. I am moderately discriminating. A brain and a body. Is that too much to ask? I really don't think that's fair. You can't possibly know how I behave with men. No, I am not too critical or aggressive. You know, this is the reason why I live 2,500 miles away from you. Would you like to talk to Alan? He's right here. He's dying to talk to you. Hi, Grandma. No, I haven't asked anybody specific yet. There are a couple of prospects. (PIANO PLAYING) I would like herbal tea, chamomile if you have it, and the fresh berries but no cream. No cream. I'm fine. So, Jennifer tells me you're divorced. Well, not exactly. I mean, actually, my wife and I are still living together. But we have an arrangement, you see. We both date other people. (VIOLIN PLAYING) Um, Nina tells me that you're divorced. Yeah. It's been about a year and a half. Oh. But, uh... I miss Janice. I think about her... All the time. It was all my fault. I wasn't... I wasn't a very good husband. But I was an even worse father. (CRYING) We had five kids. I miss those kids so damn much. I almost brought the youngest one along tonight. (SOBBING) He's two and a half. And then I'll have the salmon. But could you ask him to cook it in just the tiniest bit of oil? WAITER: Absolutely. Thank you. You're welcome. WAITER: Sir? I'll have the goose liver pate, the baby lamb chops, rare, French fries, well done. Let's skip the vegetable all together, shall we? And a diet soda. MAN: I keep looking... But I just can't seem to find the right woman. It's not a communication thing. I mean, I think of myself as a very sensitive guy. It's, uh, of a more intimate nature than that. See, I have a real problem because... Well, I have an enormous... My theory of women is whatever they say, do the opposite. If they say they're not hungry, order a dinner. They'll eat it. They say they don't wanna go out, get courtside seats to the Sixers. They'll show up. They say be gentle, I say rough them up a little. They say they don't wanna have sex... I did. I had a great time. So, can I see you tonight? Oh, you know, I'm going to Atlantic City today with a girlfriend, and, um, I don't think we'll be back until late. Well, I'll call you. (CHUCKLING) Oh, God. Hi. Hi. What are you doing up so early? I was awakened by a strange male voice. Yes, well... Don't worry. You won't be hearing that again. So, what was wrong with that one? He exaggerates. Uh, Mom, don't take this the wrong way, but I really don't like it when you have men stay over. You know what? I don't like it that much either. Try and be serious here. Why do you have to turn everything into a joke? Because life is funny, Alan, or haven't you noticed? I'd just appreciate it if you wait until I'm outta here, before you start bringing men over. You make it sound like I'm some kind of a slut. I know you're not promiscuous. I know you're discriminating. Maybe to the point of being picky. Don't drag Grandma into this, shall we? I... I just don't feel it's appropriate for a son to participate in his mother's love life. Who said anything about love? You see? That's exactly what I mean. We shouldn't be having this conversation. It's really inappropriate. Alan, honey, please. Just try and understand. I want to meet somebody nice. That's all. Look, maybe you could just, uh, refrain from having anyone stay over until I graduate and move out of here. Oh, I see. We're gonna have the California discussion again. No, we're not. It's not under debate. I'm going to U.C.L.A. I'm gonna try for a scholarship. Uncle Kenny said I could stay with him for a while. Grandma thinks it's a good idea too. Anything I'm against, Grandma thinks is a good idea. And I do too. Doesn't that count for anything? Frankly, no. Not as long as I have to pay for it. Well, I'm not staying here. I'm sick of this place. Alan... No, don't "Alan" me! I don't wanna live here anymore. I'm not the little man of the house. I want my own life! That is inappropriate. (BELLS CHIMING) JENNIFER: He's 17, for God's sake. He's gonna change his mind eight times before he decides where he wants to go to college. If you believe that, you don't know Alan. This is my worst nightmare, that he ends up in college with my mother. I can't believe you still care what she thinks of you. You can't? No. As a matter of fact, I myself have come to terms with the whole mother issue. Oh, really? I envy you. Mmm-hmm. (SNIFFS) Hey, are you okay? Yeah, I just feel weird and... I'm fine. (SIGHS) I've got to sit down. What? Do you feel faint? No, I just... I'm achy, and my hands are weird. They're swollen. Well, maybe you're coming down with something. Oh, God. Do you think you have a fever? I can't get sick. Not now. I've got Alan's graduation. I got term papers. Whoa. Can you walk? I want to go home. Okay. (ALARM BUZZING) (BUZZING STOPS) (SIGHS) (EXHALES) Yes, this is Hope Altman. I need a substitute for today. I'm sorry, I can't talk. I have to hang up. Feeling a little better now? No. I can barely move my fingers. Well, I'll give you some cortisone to relieve the swelling, but I think it's a contact dermatitis. BOY: Okay, Alan, get out. ALAN: All right. Take care, you guys. See you later. GIRL: See you, Alan. BOY: Good night, Al. I'll miss you, Beth. I had a great time. Oh, me too. Would you like to get together again next weekend? I... Yeah, yeah, that would be great. Okay. Okay. (ENGINE STARTING) BOY: Okay, who's next? BETH: I am. I am. I gotta get home. BOY: See you later. BETH: Bye, Alan. (CAR HORN HONKING) (KEYS CLINKING) (SHUSHING) (HUMMING) HOPE: Alan? Alan, I need you. Alan? Mom? Mom, are you okay? I can't be absolutely certain. I suspect rheumatoid arthritis. We need to run some other tests. Your sed rate is high. I want some more blood work. Lupus is a real possibility. Extreme fatigue. Lethargy, depression. Mrs. Altman, have you considered talking to a psychiatrist? I'm sick and I can't deal with it myself. Can I... Can I come out there and stay with you, Mom? Come on, girls. Let's go. You first. Come on. Hey! What's that thing on the side of your head? Laura. It's okay. It's a scar. Why do you have it? I got in a car accident a long time ago. I got a bad cut there. AUDREY: Will it ever go away? ALAN: No. She reminds me of you. Thanks. Strange mixture of curious, obsessive and self-involved. Yeah. If you weren't so disease-ridden, I'd punch you hard in the arm like I used to. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Oh, my God. You didn't tell me there were already here. Yeah. Oh, please, help me. Don't let them kill me with love. Are you okay, honey? I'm fine, Mom. That's why I flew out here. Is there anything you need? Can I get you anything? Daddy. Annie? ANNIE: We're in the kitchen. Not bad, huh? Jeez. What do you think? Well, you've done it. Perfect wife, perfect kids, perfect house. Oh, yeah. I'm so glad I get to stay at the trailer park with mom and dad. Now, now, let's not be snide. I'm not. Really. Just because you make six times as much as the average school teacher. It's more like 12, actually. Well, whatever it is, you deserve it. You do. You've worked really hard for your success. In fact, I think they should be paying you more. Really? You think so? Oh, yeah. Absolutely. You make America laugh. All I do is teach them to think. (CHUCKLING) Look, Auntie Hope. My fish. Oh, neato. Okay, that's it. We're flushing Goldie down the toilet. No. Daddy's joking, sweetheart. I knew that. (CHUCKLING) Isn't she smart? Candy? This man is lying on the bench there, practically in rags. So, I walk over and I give him what's left of my lunch. Oh, Dad, maitre d' to the planet. Oh, no thanks. You know, I always give leftovers from the deli to the street people. I say, why waste? It's all wrapped up and everything. No, no, not for me. So, this guy, he opens it and he says, "Corned beef? I don't want it. I don't eat meat." That's not what happened. Yes, it is. That's exactly what happened. Your mother thinks I'm an idiot. Well? Hey, it's been a long day. Hope is sleepy. Yeah, I'm a little tired myself. What do you say we head for home, huh? Yep. Come on, honey. I can't believe I'm gonna live with those people again. Yeah, they're exhausting, aren't they? Oh, I am tired. Well, look at the bright side. You won't be up until at least 6:30. Oh, great. Hey, never should have graduated and left me alone with them like you did. I didn't leave you alone. Ha. I cleared the way for you. I... I cut through the thorns and the brambles so you could just skip along the path free as a bird. (SCOFFS) It's a mixed metaphor, by the way. I knew that. God, it's amazing. Everything went by in a second and a half. Do you believe how old we are? Some days. (CAR DOOR CLOSING) It's amazing, Uncle Ken. What? Such a minor talent like yourself should help himself to such a huge slice of the American pie. (CHUCKLING) You're intensely jealous. Yeah. Yeah, I am. I'll never have anything like this. Never say never. If I can do it, someone as mediocre as yourself can really soar. Really. (CHUCKLING) I know what you're thinking. And the answer is yes. I have a number of hot steaming babes lined up for you. That's not what I was thinking. (SIGHS) You're gonna think I'm a horrible person for even saying this, but... What if this was mom's way of trying to get me to stay with her? Oh, gee, Alan. I don't think... She knew I was planning to come out here to college. What if she got sick of some sort of psychosomatic thing? I mean, what if metaphysically she brought it on herself, and it worked, and it kept us together? You think I'm a crazy person for even thinking this? No, I don't. But I don't think that that's what happened. (WHISPERING) Want a beer? Yeah. Go get us two. Oh. Oh, there you are. You and Kenny. You were always so close. No, we weren't. I left home before he went to high school. Oh. Look at this one. This is the three of you. Andrea would be what? Forty-five. Forty-five? Yeah. Oh. Oh, here are you and Kenny at the beach. Tell me, how much cuter could he have been? You always liked him best. That isn't so. I loved all three of you equally. Each one... Mom, I'm kidding. Oh. Hope, here's one of you as a little girl. (CHUCKLING) Look at that adorable face. It's Andrea. No, no, it's you. Andrea? No, it's not. I know because you're carrying that godforsaken teddy bear. You had to take it everywhere. You were such a stubborn child. Oh, I was pliable. I just didn't do everything your way like everybody else did. Oh, what a complete exaggeration. I am not a willful person. (HUMMING SARCASTICALLY) What are you laughing at? (HOPE LAUGHING) I... Let's not argue. Hopey just got here. Oh, I'm sorry, darling. Oh, he's right. I--I--I only want you to be comfortable, you know? Can I get you anything? Mom, not too comfortable. I'm not an invalid. I'm gonna get better and get out of here as soon as possible. Understood? Oh, absolutely. Hey, in all honesty... I mean, I have to say you already look a whole lot better than you did last night. Really. I mean, the swelling's going down. Right, David? Absolutely. What is that? Oh, my God. Oh! Oh, look at this. (CHUCKLING) You hated my hair. I did. How could you put streaks in your hair? I was 16. She was a kid. You don't put streaks in your hair when you're a kid. (CHUCKLING) I was 16. That's what they did then. DOCTOR: Yeah, they sent me your records and the reports of your lab work from Philadelphia. Yeah, the doctors there thought it was either lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. Yeah, well, I don't agree. I think it's scleroderma. What's that? A deli entree? Kenneth, please. In English, Dr. Mossman. Scleroderma, it's Greek for hardening of the skin. (LAUGHS) Oh, God. Is it as awful as it sounds? Well, it can cover a whole range of symptoms. In its simplest form, it severely affects the skin. It can affect a part of the body, a finger, or an arm or all over. It's crippling, debilitating, but you can live with it. On the other end of the spectrum, we have what we call progressive or systemic scleroderma, and it affects the vital organs. The lungs, the kidneys, the heart, as well as the skin. Well, Hope has the first kind, right? DOCTOR: No. No, I'm afraid she has the second type. Systemic scleroderma. Wait a minute. How can you be so sure? Are you absolutely positive? MOLLY: In Philadelphia, the doctors ran all kinds of tests and they couldn't figure it out. What causes it? DOCTOR: We don't know. It's only been recently that we can even diagnose it so accurately. Is there a cure? Not yet. But we're working on it. (SIGHS) Is it fatal? Some people live for a long time. How long? Well, the prognosis is not as good when the internal organs are severely affected, but you could survive for as long as 10 years. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) To tell you the truth, I'm relieved. I mean, I'm glad to finally know what it is I have. And I'll tell you something right now. I'm going to beat it. I'm going to overcome these odds. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) You know, I've always wanted to make it with a mother and a daughter. WOMAN: Try the Judds. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) WOMAN: As you can see, Vincent has only one thing on his mind. I don't have a mind. I have a thing. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) MAN: And we're clear. He took far too long with that line. Let's just speed it up. It's not funny. So? Having fun? Did you write that "thing" joke? Yeah, I had a hand in it. So, what do you think? You can do so much better than this. You're always the teacher, aren't you? So when do I get an A, teach? Oh, you got one. You are an "A." Big "A." Thanks. I like that. I got a line change. Hey, you're already dressed. Yup. Running a marathon today. (CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY) (EXHALES DEEPLY) Kenny's driving me to Santa Barbara to meet Sharon Monsky. Do you think that's a good idea? I--I mean... Maybe you should stay home and rest. (GROANING) I'm not a cripple, mom. (EXHALES) I'm not. I'm not... I am not going to think that way. I'm going to lead a normal life. You look a little pale. You sure you should be making this trip? I have to make this trip. I'm a teacher. I do homework. Sure, it looks innocent enough from the outside, but inside they're doing experiments. Kenny, do I need this? No, but I think I do. I'm a little nervous. How do I look? Is my hair okay? Let's go. Come on. SHARON: So, you're a TV writer? Yeah, sometimes. Do you know Gary Shandling or Jerry Seinfeld by any chance? No, I don't. Bummer. (CHUCKLING) Anyway, when I get to know you a little better, I'll exploit your connections for one of our benefits. How about that? Well, I look forward to it. That's not what today's about, though. So, what would you like to know? How long do I have to live? SHARON: Nobody can answer that. Ten years ago, doctors told me I had two years. I'm still here. Well, for what it's worth, I'm perfectly healthy and I feel guilty as hell about it. Kenny, shut up. (MIMICKING HOPE) Shut up. (CHUCKLING) Why don't I know about this disease? Why doesn't anybody? Maybe because it's a woman's disease. So many more people have this disease than have been diagnosed, and the majority are women of your age. Scleroderma is not rare or obscure. It's just not visible. It's difficult going out in public looking like this, having people stare at me. Scleroderma is a painful, ugly killer. It's a struggle just to survive, to take care of one's family. That's really all you can do. Is there any chance of a cure? There's more than a chance. This is a solvable problem. Maybe not in my lifetime. Maybe in yours. I, um... I may not make it to the finish line, but I'm in a race here, and I'm on a mission to solve this puzzle. There is hoke. (LAUGHS) Hoke? So, what's gonna be the most difficult thing for me to deal with? For me, the thought of leaving my three children and my husband before I'm ready is the hardest part, and I'll never be ready. (SCOFFS) You think you got problems? I got a bad case of athlete's foot. Didn't sleep a wink last night. Annie was all over me... Kenny, stop. Stop. I'm not depressed. You're not? No. Sharon's made it for 10 years. I'm gonna beat her record. I'm very competitive. Tell me about it. I thought of a way that you could help me. I want to document this. The way it feels. I want a living history. I may not look this way forever, and... I want Alan and Alan's children to... I want your children to know who I was. What do you want me to do? You look great, Mom. Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Okay, now, I don't talk until I'm talked to. Okay. Okay, I can talk. The most emotional moment... Is that on? Yeah, it's on, Dad. Go ahead. Go ahead. Oh, all right. The most emotional moment of Hope's birth... Daddy, daddy, daddy. I think that's going back a little far. Yeah, she's right. Maybe you could describe Hope growing up. Oh, God. I feel like I'm at my own funeral. All right, growing up. Well, she was a very happy child, huh? Hey, a lot of spunk. She was a leader. Also, she was very cute, like a little doll. She loved to be hugged and kissed. What? Am I boring you? No. You're boring everybody. KEN: Okay, Mom, let's get your point of view. What was Hope like as a teenager, as a young woman? I don't think I should be hearing this. Hope--Hope was always very easy with people. I mean, you know how she talks. She was like that. Very friendly, loved people. So you had no, um, conflicts with her growing up? No. Oh, I had a lot of disagreements with her, mainly because of the guys she went out with. Uh-huh. Her taste was different. She picked the wrong husband. Okay, cut, cut. This is not the documentary I had in mind. KEN: You want to be the network censor here? Come on. Uh, Dad? Well, hey, hey. The truth is, between Hope and Mother, there was some bickering. He is so full of it. Come on. She wanted her independence. All right, let's put it that way. She wanted her independence. That is not it, David. She didn't have good taste in men. There are some women who don't. DAVID: Mol, she wanted her independence. Kenny? She needed to get away from us. Hey, she got married at 20. She left home and went to Philadelphia. She wasn't 20. What? Oh, so what year? Another year? What are you splitting hairs for? Am I talking here? She left home when she was 22. That is... That is not unusual. I think we got enough right here. When a child leaves at 22, you don't exactly call that running away from home, do you? It's okay, Mom. It's good. Hey, how about if I play something on the piano? No, I think we got enough right here for a CableACE Award. Really, it's very good. Well, come on, it's not that bad. David, call the doctor. Honey? Honey, are you okay? Uh-uh. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) KEN: Ooh, look, flowers. Look. Oh, pretty girl. Can I get a double cheeseburger, fries and... I'm so sorry. Look. People. Lots of people. Ah, strange cryptic message. Staff in there. Here we are. (EXCLAIMS) (EXHALING DEEPLY) Her flesh is very rigid. I can't insert the needle. Let me try. (LAUGHING IN PAIN) MALE NURSE: There, that wasn't so bad now, was it? Yeah, not for you. (EXHALING) Kenneth, out. Now. I just wanna know what's going on. What's with all the blood work? Her blood sugar's way up. It could be from the cortisone. I think the scleroderma may be affecting her kidneys. We need to run some more tests. You guys run more tests than the D.M.V. Kenneth. Okay. I'm going. Hope, baby. I hate this disease more than anything else in the world. I swear to you, I'm going to kill it! Sweetheart, I know you will. I wanna talk to Alan, alone. Of course. We'll wait out in the corridor. I don't know what to do. Just be here for me. Come here. Do you know how proud I am of you? You're a wonderful boy. So, Alan, how did it go in there? Tell us your innermost thoughts. I really don't feel like talking. KEN: But all your fans out here are interested. Please, Uncle Kenny, not now. KEN: But what better time than now to capture the drama, the tension, the pain. All right. You want a statement? I'll give you a statement. I'm tired of watching my mother get sicker and sicker. I can't stand to see her like that. I feel helpless. I want to run away. You know what the worst part is? All I can do is think about myself. I put off starting to go to college. I spend all my nights and days here in the hospital. The only people I see are my family. When do I get a life? (SNORING) Kenny. I've been waiting for you. Let's go outside and talk. You can see it, can't you? What? Well, she's better. She'll be out of here in a few days. Uh, Dad, trust me. She may be out of here, but she's not better. You don't think so? Well, she's got a lot more color. She's probably running a fever. Why do you have to be so negative? Negative? Dad, she has scleroderma. She's on dialysis for kidney disease. Her esophagus is deteriorating. You think she's getting better? No. She's a fighter. She's a human being, Pop. She's a very sick human being. Oh... You don't know her. You don't spend the time with her that we do. I mean, Molly and I, we can see improvements. Look. She's better. I guarantee it. Sure, Pop. Okay. Oh, hey. Shawniqua. I want you to meet my son, Kenny. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Shawniqua's little boy, Rakeem, plays second base for the Inglewood Blue Jays, and her daughter, Nicole, teaches school. (INTERMITTENT BEEPING) Can I get some help here? Right away. I'm right behind ya. Oh, please, God, don't do this. I'll do anything. I'll, um... I'll write jokes for Tom Snyder. Just come on, let her get better. Let her get better. It's all right. The drug reaction. She's gonna be fine. (SNIFFLES) Sure she is. Thanks. Yeah, her daughter teaches first grade. MOLLY: Whose daughter? Shawniqua, the nurse. Her daughter, Nicole, teaches first grade. So, one of her students raises his hand and says, "I have to go to the little boys' room." So he's gone for about five minutes, and then he comes back... What's the point of lean corn beef? Either way, it clogs your arteries. Mom, dad's telling his story. I know. I heard it already. Well, I'd like to hear it. Well, he comes back, and he says, "I can't find it." So she draws him a little diagram and sends him on his way again. I thought she sent another child with him. No, no, no, no. That's not the way it goes. The kid comes back again, and he says, "I still can't find it." Then she sends another little boy, Mikey... Yeah. ...to help him find the lavatory. So, both boys come back after a few minutes, and she says, "Well, did you find it?" And Mikey says, "Yeah, he had his undershorts on backwards." (GIGGLING) Underpants. Yay! That's so cute. What a sweet story. You think so? He's told it better. Oh, and be careful, honey. Don't draw on the table. But it's for Aunt Hope. It's very beautiful, honey. We'll take it to her tomorrow, okay? She's coming home. KEN: I'd like to propose a toast. (MIMICKING ED SULLIVAN) To my lovely but immobilized sister who couldn't be here tonight. She is not immobilized. Not yet, but there is hope. (CHUCKLING) Kenny, knock it off. Finish your chopped liver, will ya? No, I wanna sing a song. Uh, it's for Hope. I'd like to dedicate this number to my sister. * Scleroderma Scleroderma * Scleroderma, Scleroderma, Scleroderma * (GIRLS GIGGLING) That's enough. We don't need this. And to continue with my medley of hit. * Scleroderma Scleroderma * Scleroderma, Scleroderma * Okay, guys, let's go. That's it. Come on, take your coat. LAURA: But we're having fun, aren't we? * Scleroderma * Get your coat. Way to go, Daddy. LAURA: Mommy! Shame on you. I made your favorite. Cranberry juice Jell-O. I'm not hungry. Well, be that as it may, you have to eat. Here. Okay. Here you are, hon. Here. (GRUNTS) I can't! It's okay. It's okay. I can't do it. We'll try it later. It's all right, honey. It's all right. Honest. I cannot stand this. I know. I know, honey. It's terrible to be sick. Is there anything I can get you? Will you stop saying that? The only thing you can get me is better. And you can't do that. Nobody can. All right? You understand? I hate this! I hate this disease. (SOBBING) I never wanted you to take care of me. I'm... I'm embarrassed. Shh. I should be taking care of you. No. (SHUSHING) Mommy. Mommy, I'm so ashamed. (SOBBING CONTINUES) I'm 40 years old, and I'm still living with my parents. Hey. You think you've got problems? Your mother and I were waiting for you kids to grow up and move out before we got a divorce. (LAUGHING) Come on, get well and get out of here, will you? (LAUGHING) I'm trying. I'm trying. Thanks a lot. No, I got it. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO) (TIRES SQUEALING) What are you doing, sitting here in the dark? I was meditating. You were sleeping. I saw you drool. Drooling is part of my mantra. Did you visit your mother today? No. No, I didn't feel like it. Well, let me tell you. It looks like spin art in the room. She can't keep anything down. I'm sorry I missed that. Well, it's been a few days. You gonna check up on her tomorrow? I don't know. I'm getting tired of the "good little boy" routine. Oh? Yeah. I got accepted at U.C.L.A. I wanna start going to school. I wanna start meeting girls. I want more of a normal life. Gee, I don't know, Alan. You may just have to settle for unique. Don't drool on the remote. Good night. (SIGHS) Hard day? (STIFLED GIGGLING) Have you been drinking? (SIGHS) We had to work late. One of the guys brought back a six-pack. I shared a malt beer with a co-executive producer. Is that okay? Hey, it was just an innocent question. (HOPE SCREAMING) HOPE: The dog! The dog! Hope? Hope? Get him off of me! I'm here! HOPE: Don't come near me. Hope, Mommy's coming! HOPE: He's coming! Can't you see him? Help! They're killing me! (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hello? Uh, yeah. I'm on my way. What is it? Hope's going nuts. I'll get Alan. You're killing me! This isn't her. It's got to be the medication. Oh, my God! MAN: Just relax. Easy. (CRACKLING) KEN: Hey, wait. KEN: Her arms are very brittle. You bastard! You're hurting me. Hold her down. You're hurting me. You're hurting me. (GROANING) Easy. Easy. (ANNIE GROANING) That's it. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Out through the nose, in through the mouth. Or is it the other way around? I can't remember. You're not helping, Kenny. You're not helping, Kenny. DOCTOR: Push into it. Good. Oh, that was a good one. Okay, it's crowning. Very good, very good. Okay, it looks like a little brunette. (BABY CRYING) Is it a boy or a girl? We'll know in a moment. (ANNIE GRUNTING) Good, Annie. Okay. It's a girl. ANNIE: Oh, it's a girl. Ten fingers, ten toes. Okay. She's looking healthy. Oh, my God. Oh, baby. (BABY COOING) (GASPS) Hey. Oh! You just missed Kenny and the girls. They just went upstairs to see you. Oh, Annie. Oh, baby Penny. She's beautiful. Thank you. Oh. Oh, honey, here. Take a picture. Oh. Okay. You hold her, Hope. Can I? Can I? Yeah. Oh, yeah. (LAUGHING) ALAN: Smile, Mom. Look at that arm. ANNIE: I know. You know, I think it's crazy, but... ALAN: No, she does. She looks like you. Like I used to. Just like I used to. It's so nice the baby was born here. There's a yin-yang thing going on. You know, young, old, healthy, sick. Yeah, it's nice for the family. When they visit, they get a twofer. (CLATTERING) Mom? (BEEPING) KEN: Hi. Hey, you. Hi. HOPE: Come here. Come here. We just saw the baby. Oh, she's so beautiful. Another one that looks like Annie, huh? I think she looks like me. Oh, yeah? (CHUCKLING) LAURA: Aunt Hope. Uh, you have visitors. I've been waiting for you. Can you please get in here right away and get in bed? Oh, yes, ma'am. Mmm. Excuse me. KEN: Yeah. (LAURA HUMMING) What are you doing, honey? I have some magic to make her better. (HUMMING) I could use some help over here. Audrey, come and stand next to me. Okay. Here, Dad. Thanks. Now, put your hands over her like I do. Abracadabra. Abracadabra. E-I-E-I-O. AUDREY: You know what, Laura? This is silly. No, no, it's not. Dear Lord, we thank you for the food that we are about to eat. Amen. (CHUCKLING) (HUMMING) (HUMMING) (CHUCKLING) (HUMMING) Focus on the writing. We have exactly two hours. How about that Ethel Merman bit? No one knows who Ethel Merman is anymore. Well, they should. She was a landmark. Spare me a history of the American musical theater. You see? He's doing it again. You know, if you guys got paid for bickering, you'd all be rich. Just knock it off! Yeah. Maybe I'll just do that. (SOBBING) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Hello, sailor. Thanks again. So you're not the chatty type? Okay. Oh, no. Things just aren't going too great for me right now. Oh, yeah. You think you got problems? My boyfriend just dumped me for my half-sister. Really? Yeah. I got about half a sister. She's in and out of the hospital, but she's dying slowly and painfully. Oh. Bummer. Oh, that's nothing. My other sister, Andrea, she died about 10 years ago. She was in her thirties... Of an aneurysm. Very unusual for someone of that age. Wow. Really? I'm not finished. These events have made my parents' life a living hell, and they are really nice people who didn't and don't deserve to lose both of their daughters who were and are really caring and sensitive people. I bet... Did I tell you about my nephew? He's this really terrific kid who, you know, should be carefree, and having the time of his life, but you know, he almost died in a car accident when he was nine years old. So he's worried all the time, and he's suffering from a severely broken heart 'cause he's losing his mom. Oh, that's so... And on top of all that, my wife and I just had this really terrific, beautiful, healthy baby girl. And instead of being at home with her, I'm sitting here in this godforsaken place drinking myself silly and feeling sorry for myself. Mister, I think you're a little too chatty. I think you should go home to your wife and take a taxi. Get him a taxi. BARTENDER: Gotcha. Good luck. Good night. What the hell do you think you're doing? Look, I had a couple of beers. Maybe three. Does that make me a drunk? Yes, actually, I think you're beginning to qualify. Annie, give me a break. There's a lot happening right now. You're damn right. But it is happening to Hope, not to you. You have to be... Look at me. You have to be strong right now. For your parents, and for Alan and for our kids. We have a new baby, you know. I'm sorry, Annie. (SOBBING) I just don't know what to do with these feelings. Sweetheart, it's okay. It's okay. You don't have to be strong for me. Who here knows the story of the pig with the wooden leg? Keep it clean, Dave. Does it have underpants in it? DAVID: Underpants? (LAUGHING) No. Laura, eat your vegetables. This guy's walking along a country road, and he sees this beautiful farm. Why are these people always walking? Don't they have cars? And in the barnyard... * E-I-E-I-O * DAVID: That's right. He sees this big, fat pig with a wooden leg. Well, just then, the farmer comes out. So this guy says to the farmer, "Gee, that's a beautiful pig, but why has he got a wooden leg?" And the farmer says, "Oh, him? Oh, that's some terrific pig. "Saved my boy's life, you know. Yeah. "Once, when we were all out at night, the house caught on fire, "and that pig ran inside and dragged my boy out to safety." Dave, hurry it up. The rye bread is growing mould here. All right, all right. It's... So the visitor says, "That is absolutely incredible, but tell me, "why does the pig have a wooden leg?" And the farmer says, "Well, "for a pig that special, you don't eat it all at once." (ALL LAUGHING) That's bad. (COUGHING) MOLLY: Honestly. I mean, that was in such bad taste, and the children sitting right here. What's so awful? You're eating corned beef, for God's sake. Hopey, do you have a problem with that story? (CLEARS THROAT) Uh-uh. To tell you the truth, I think I know exactly what that pig is going through. AUDREY: I didn't get it really. LAURA: Me neither. LAURA: We were just laughing because everybody else was. (GROANS) It hurts. I'm sorry, honey. (WINCES) You tired? Mmm. You sleep now. Rest. It's the best thing for you. Thanks, Mom. (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR CLOSING) DAVID: Hey, how's she doing? (SIGHING) She's had better days. How about you? Oh. When she breathes, I breathe. When she doesn't, I'm suffocating. Hey, hey, hey, come here. Listen, Hope is a very courageous girl. If anybody can beat this disease, she can. (CRYING) She can't. Molly, don't talk that way. Oh, face it, David. Her body is turning to stone bit by bit. A little more every day. She can fight it. A lot of people survive for years. (SNIFFLING) (SIGHING) I don't think I could do this. To live... Through the death of my daughter. I... I... I always assumed I would go first. And now... (SNIFFLING) To face the loss of another one of my children... Look, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, come on. Come on, come on. Molly, shh. (CRYING) Oh, David. Oh, David. It's all right. It's all right. Okay. You have to be part of the archive like everybody else. ANNIE: Who, me? So, Annie, tell me. What? What do you think is Hope's most outstanding quality? You can be absolutely candid, good or bad. Uh... Sometime this week, Annie. I know, I know. I-I'm just trying to decide between her-- her courage... Yeah. And her-- her humor. That's a good answer. I--I think I'd have to go with her courage. That's what my parents said. Hope's courage would be the thing that heals her. Well, they would say that. The exaggeration machine known as Molly and Dave. (LAUGHING) Hello. We're talking about my parents here. You said I could be completely candid, so... Kenny, you know I love your parents, but they are incurable optimists. (STAMMERING) Uh, what's wrong with that? You should maybe put the camera away. Really? Really. There's nothing at all wrong with that. It's just that, sometimes, optimism spills over into denial. Uh-huh. Are we there yet? Kenny, listen to me, okay? Your parents... Your parents are incredible people. They are... Oh, they are so strong. They're fighting the good fight, and they have never lost faith, and that's a good thing. But Hope is very, very sick, and she's not going to get better. And nobody is helping her deal with that. Nobody is preparing her for death. (CHILDREN LAUGHING) Can I get a hug? Oh, I love you. I love you too. No, no! The baby! Nobody's watching the baby! That is such a low tactic. Oh, no, please. Hold on! (SCREAMING) Oh, I can't believe you did that. (SCREAMING) (PHONE RINGING) That was really bad. (RINGING CONTINUES) Hello? She's back in the hospital. Damn it! (BEEPING) (LAUGHING) Hey. I planned a trip to come and see you. I thought you were gonna be at your parents. What happened? I don't know. I had trouble breathing. My mother had a problem with that. (CHUCKLING) Come on in. Look at this. It's signed by all of your ninth graders. You should've seen them. Each one of them took such a long time. Oh, Jen, it's okay. I know what I look like. The good news is, I save a fortune on lipstick. (LAUGHING) What do the doctors say? Oh, well, that's the bad news. Uh, the doctors say they don't know what to do, so why don't we give her a new drug? I'm on $50,000 worth of drugs right now. Yeah, just make sure your teacher's insurance is paid up. If mine wasn't, Alan would be selling cookies door to door. What's gonna happen to you? What's gonna happen to me? I'm gonna get better. I just have to stay alive till they find a cure, and I'm determined to do that. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) What, every time I see you, it has to be in the I.C.U.? HOPE: Hey, you guys! Come here. This is my friend Jennifer, who is my co-teacher in Philadelphia, and she spent her entire life savings to come visit me on summer vacation. Sure, I know you. You were the one who was nabbed in the McMartin thing, right? Funny. My brother writes sitcoms. Don't worry. It's not contagious. I brang more pictures. (GASPING) Wonderful! One can never have too many pictures. LAURA: Ooh! (HUMMING) Where's Alan? He couldn't make it. He's got a cold. He does not! He does from the swimming pool. He was in too long. Then why don't I have a cold? Forget it, Laura. HOPE: You are such a liar. (LAUGHING) You are the worst liar, Kenny. You always were. Your ears turn red. They do! Oh, fine, now everybody knows. ALL: * Daddy has red ears Daddy has red ears * Daddy has red ears, Daddy has red ears * Daddy * (COUGHING) Quick, get a doctor. Let's go. Hello, ladies. BOTH: Hi. So, what's up, doc? So, it doesn't look good. Her lungs are deteriorating, and I think... I think this is a good time for you to get everybody together, and you're gonna need to prepare yourselves for a difficult time. I'll be on the floor. If you need anything, have me paged. ANNIE: So who wants dessert? Laura, honey, you listening? I said your favorite word, "dessert." I'm not hungry. I think I may be sleepy. I'll go. Excuse me. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Who is it? Ho, ho, ho, Santa Claus. Hi, Daddy. You okay? Yes. Oh. (SIGHS) No. You got a tummy ache? No. Got a headache? No. A sore throat? No. Runny nose? Daddy. Well, what then? (SIGHS) I have a sore heart. Oh, honey, why? What is it? Tell me. Hope is very sick, isn't she? Yes, she is. My magic didn't work. Laura, sweetheart, that's not true. Your magic did work. It made Hope happy. It gave her strength. She got much better because of you. Maybe it just wore out? Yeah, maybe that's it, but it didn't mean nothing. It meant a whole lot, baby. I'm not a baby. No. You're most certainly not a baby. But you are my baby. (GIGGLING) Aren't you, huh? Uh-huh. Bye. Bye-bye. KEN: It's a beautiful shot, huh? Yeah, the baby's not bad either. (COUGHING) KEN: So you had no conflict with her growing up? MOLLY: No. Oh, I had a lot of disagreements with her because of the guys she went out with. Her taste was different. (SIGHING) These people. Our parents, they're just too... Real. Have you ever thought about a sitcom? Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Freeze that. Oh. Kenny, look how I've changed. Yeah, your hair is a little longer. No. No, I mean it. Look at me. Look at me. The person inside of me doesn't look like this. Ooh, isn't she beautiful, Hope? And bright as a penny, too, aren't you? Sit in your stroller. Annie, help me. What is it? Water? (SLURPING) (COUGHING) She may be thirsty, but she shouldn't have fluids. I didn't know. Her esophagus. She can't handle it. I didn't know. Hope, can you listen to me? There's nothing to be afraid of. Whether you are in this body or not, there is nothing to be afraid of. You could just let it go. You can go where you won't have any more pain. Andrea. Your sister. I can't do it to them again. (SNIFFLING) Hi, Annie. Hello, honey. How's my girl today? Feeling better? You look better, sweetheart. Oh, who's this little... Oh, honey, your lips are completely dry. Are you thirsty? She's not supposed to have any water. Well, I mean, she's clearly not comfortable. I--I think we should talk to somebody. All right, I'll go. She's tired. Let's let her rest. She's doing this for you. What? Hope is fighting so hard to stay alive because she doesn't want to put you and David through another death. (GASPS) That's not it. Hope--Hope's a fighter. I mean, she's determined to get better, and she can. Hope is not going to get better. That's not absolutely certain. Your beautiful daughter is trapped in that body. She is trapped in that body with so much pain. She needs something from you. You know that. You do. She needs your permission to die. (GASPS) Hope never got the breaks. She had to work so hard for everything, you know? She always wanted so much to be liked. You know, she raised Alan all by herself? I know. She nursed him through the car accident. I know. Yeah. Do you know how many letters and cards I got from the students, the people she worked with? They always say the same thing. What a wonderful, wonderful teacher she was. And a lovable person. She still is. Maybe she needs a rest. (SOBBING) Oh, Ken, have you met Nurse Stark? Hi, pleasure to meet you. She's taking night courses in psychology at Northridge. Ken's a comedy writer. Really? Say something funny. Uh, what were Adam's first words to Eve? "Stand back, sweetheart. I don't know how big this thing gets." He is funny. (BEEPING) East 2A. You're looking very natty today. Oh, you think so? We should pick up some jeans, show off that butt of yours. It is one of my best features. All the girls say so. Which girls, exactly? All right, your mother says so. I mean, she doesn't exactly say it out loud, but I know she thinks so. Really? Uh-huh. Very possessive woman, your mother. On the other hand, I'm an insanely jealous man, so we mesh very nicely. Can you keep a secret? Since we married, I have never been with another woman. I... I never wanted to, Ken. (CRYING) Oh, Kenny, Hope is dying. We mustn't let your mother know. I mean, we have to be positive. You understand? Yeah, Pop, come on. Come on. Kenny. Look what I had to do to get a little attention in this family. Yeah, but look at the quality time we got to spend together. (CHUCKLING) (COUGHING) I'm so sorry I'm sick. (SHUSHING) I love you, Hope. You okay? Mmm-hmm. You signed up for your classes yet? Asian History, Beginning French, Film Comedies of the '40s and American Literature. Uh... Mom, can I get you anything? A U.C.L.A. T-shirt. Alan, I am so proud of you. You're a good man. (PHONE RINGING) Yes. We'll be right there. It's time. I'm here, darling. Mommy's here. I would give anything... Anything to be able to hold you, sweetie, to take you in my arms and rock you like I did when you were a little girl. Do you remember? I would cradle you and sing to you. * My funny valentine * Sweet comic valentine * You make me smile * With my heart * Your looks are laughable * Still, you're my favorite * David, you have to say something to her. You have to tell her she can let go. No, I can't do that. What's happening? They're cleaning her up. We can go in, in a minute. What do the doctors say? Well, it's not good, but... She refused the respirator and the feeding tube. So she can talk? MOLLY: No, but she's conscious. She was very clear about it. She shook her head. Uh, can she hear us? You can go back in now. I don't know what to do. What am I supposed to do? Just stay here with her, with us. Mom, I want to talk to her. Is that okay? Hey, Hope. Don't worry about Alan. It looks like he's going to be a wonderful person. You brought him up right. He's a great class project. Um... Uh, Audrey sent over some more of her pictures. This morning, Laura asked me to call General Electric because they bring good things to life. Kids, huh? (CRYING) So, Hope, looks like this body doesn't want you anymore, so kiss it goodbye. You've got better things to do with that rare soul of yours. Okay? Oh, God. I'm gonna miss you so much. Do you want to say something? I don't know what to say. Maybe if you just stand closer. You don't have to say anything. She just wants to feel you there. Mom. Mom, can you hear me? I love you, Mom. And you know what else? I like you. You're a wonderful friend. (SIGHS) I... Alan, it's okay. Maybe you just need to be alone right now, okay? Wait a minute. She moved. She's sitting up. She's getting dressed. (GASPS) It's not funny, huh? Poor taste. Shame on you. Why does it take an illness to make us say the things we don't say unless they're sick? Could you run that by me again? You know what I mean. The only good thing that's come out of this disease is that it's brought the family closer. So you're saying it would have been better to do it without the disease, right? Not funny? Nothing's not funny. If I've given you that, my man, I consider my job complete. My mom gave me that. That's a good point. Boys, you better come back in. Hope, you want a sandwich? Some chicken soup? Sweetheart, do you know what a treasure you are, hmm? My loving, wonderful girl. I h-- I have such admiration for you. Oh, sweetheart, you fought like a champion, but now, now it's-- It's over. Now you-- You have to... You... You have to let go, sweetheart. We'll all see each other again. I know it. (INHALES DEEPLY) (EXHALES) Boy, does this not feel right. (SIGHS) Maybe we should bring her over here. What, the body? No, the head too. This is in very poor taste. Hey, anybody heard about Saul and Ida Stein? I hope this isn't the story I think you're going to tell. Saul isn't feeling well, so he and Ida go to the doctor. This is totally inappropriate for the children. It's too late, Mom. Does it have underpants? Anyway, the doctor says, "I'm gonna need a urine sample, "stool sample and semen sample." What's se-semen? Never mind. What's stool? A little chair. Are you happy now, David? Does everybody understand what urine is? No, tell me. Pee-pee. That's right, sweetheart. Semen, stool and urine. Are we all clear on this? Right. Now, Saul's got a hearing problem. He turns to his wife and says, "Ida, what did the doctor say?" Ida says, "He wants to see your underpants." (GIRLS GIGGLING) That's terrible. Underpants! DAVID: Underpants. (LAUGHING) I got two underwear jokes, and you heard them. All right, it wasn't so good. ANNIE: Was that funny?
