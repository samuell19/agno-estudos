M. Gorky Central Film Studio for Children and Youth Oh, why can't I sleep at nighttime... Why, I dunno it myself, my girl... Alyona! Alyona! I've got no time to play hide-and- seek with you, daughter. No one here, either. Alyona! Don't you want to say goodbye to me, daughter? Or did anyone hurt you? Take me along, father, will you? You're so strange, Alyona. Why are you hiding? What would you like me to bring you? What present? A Persian shawl? Or a cat from overseas? Or maybe you want a talking parrot, or a monkey? Father, will you please bring me the scarlet flower? The scarlet flower? The scarlet flower. I saw it in my dream. But don't tell anyone about it, and don't ask anyone. It will show up itself... the scarlet flower. It will be the most beautiful flower in the whole world! Alyona!

POKROVSKY - I think he would never leave. - And won't bring us any presents. - We must go, we must hurry. - Yes, yes... We must go, we must hurry. Yes, you must. - Goodbye, dear father! - Farewell, father! - Goodbye, goodbye, father! - Come back soon! Why are you crying? I'm not gone yet. What are you waiting for, then? I forgot something, and can't remember what it is. - Try to remember, father. - It's about the presents. Well, what do you want me to bring you? For me, a crown of precious stones to match the colour of my eyes. And for me, a hand-glass to look into and never get old. Made of crystal, with scrolls at the sides. You mean, the mirror. We haven't started the stove today, yet the chimney's smoking. Where's Alyona? Come on, go! - Will he ever leave? - Let's move the clock's hands. Alyona's disappeared again! Yegorka! Take it to the cart. Who's playing jokes here? - Where's the master? - Go and hurry up the master! - It's noon already! - He has to go! - Where's Alyona? - We haven't seen her. - Is that Alyona's piglet? - Where did it run to? Listen, Alyona wants to go with father. That's the last straw! Father! - We have found Alyona! - Alyona is in the cart. - She's hiding in the cart! - She wants to go with father! Let go, I'm going to tell father, and he will take me with him! Leave me alone! Father, take me with you! I'll be useful to you. If a horse gets lame, I'll cure him. Why should he be lame? We've got fine horses, with strong shoes. Fish are swimming to me, birds are flying to me, father! I can keep wolves away. Take me along! Have you ever seen a live wolf? Alyona! There she ran again! Alyona! Goodbye, Yerofei Yerofeich! Have a nice trip! Farewell! Bring us the presents! - Goodbye, father! - Come back soon! Goodbye, father! Don't forget the presents! - Bring us gifts! - Goodbye, father! Look what I can do! Yerofeich, you jump three times and you get so hot! We haven't even noticed how you came, gramps. May I sit by your fire? - You're welcome. - Will you join us for our supper? Where are you going? I've come such a long way that I forgot where I was going. - Aren't you afraid of getting lost? - My feet will lead me home. What's your name? You may call me whatever you wish. You're not so simple an old man. You've got a heavy sack. What's in it, gramps? Look for yourself. My eyes are in the front, and the sack's at the back. Isn't it a miracle! I promised my eldest daughter to bring her a crown just like this one. Old man! Where is he? Where have you disappeared, gramps? Old man! I said he was not a simple old man. Where are you going? Perhaps there's nothing like that flower in our land? One can only see it in dreams. Yerofeich, we got to go, we must hurry! Alyona dear, where's your scarlet flower? How can I find it? Yerofei Yerofeich, are you sleeping or what? You're sitting in the water. All our goods are lost. The goods got wet, Yerofeich! They're not precious goods, just boots and samovars! Yerofeich! Yerofeich... Yegorka, fish are swimming to us! Look, Yerofeich, a miracle! The old man of yesterday's coming. - Hey, gramps! - Old man! - Good day. - Good afternoon. - Does it bite? - You're scaring the fish off. Look, fisherman, can you show me the way? I've been riding all day, looking for a certain man. What else do you want? I'm wondering, are you the same man or not? No, you're not. That man was very old, about a hundred years old. You think I'm not yet a hundred? You? No. Let me look in the mirror, maybe I got younger. I've got a dressing mirror somewhere, with scrolls. Where did you get that mirror? I walked, and I found it. I decided to pick it, it might come handy. No, I'm not younger, that's me. - Let me look in it, too. - You may have it, I don't need it. But it might be useful to you, merchant. You are not a simple old man. You've helped me once again. My other daughter told me to bring her a dressing mirror with scrolls. You're not so simple either. You want to ask me something, but you won't. I'm looking for... My youngest, and dearest, daughter asked me to bring... She said not to tell anyone about it. I see. Then we are going the same way. Come on. Row straight ahead, do not take any turns. What about you? Anyone here? Just look at that! Is there anyone alive here? Good evening! Thank you very much. I'm not used to feasting alone, but I just have to try it. Isn't it something! - Tell the court hangman to come here! - I will! O, our formidable ruler, what would be your ruling? My unruly son is to be put to death! When I was free, I had lots of friends. When in trouble, I have none. Farewell, North, South, West and East! Farewell, czars, czarinas, maidens! Farewell thee, too, murderous father! I love you as ever, I put you to death forever! Farewell, my angel. Farewell, the joy of my heart. Am I dreaming, or am I awake? - Did anyone drop in? - Yes. Who?! Where on earth is everybody? Are they all dead? Am I all alone here? Did you like the treat? Ah, that's you, the old man not so simple. How did you get here? Why don't you stay here, merchant? Be our guest for a year or two. I have no time to visit with you. I like you. I wanted to get myself a comrade. I must hurry, they wait for me at home, and my trade calls me up. Old man?! He disappeared again. Old man, where are you? Where can he be? Old man! Come on, let me out, I've lost my way! Old man, why did you lure me in here? That old man... He got me all confused. I beg your pardon, ma'am. Why are you coughing all the time? Come here, I'll cure you. Thank you, ma'am. I've lost my way, I don't know the way out. Come on, take a sniff, you'll be all right in a jiffy. Madam... This is a wonderful remedy, believe me. Sir! Let me go, ma'am. I need to go home. Everyone's in a hurry, everyone's running, everyone wants something. It makes one crazy. I don't agree with you, everything is quite interesting here. And I like that solitude. But, please, let me go, I'd better come some other time. Why some other time, why not now? Come on, you wanted to make a present to your daughter. But remember, the scarlet flower has never made anyone happy. Go now. Thank you, Madam. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye... Thief! Thief! You've taken my flower! You came to me as a guest, I was expecting a guest, and you made fun of me. Have mercy, my fair master, you forest beast, you deep-sea monster, forgive my innocent impertinence. You picked the flower, you're my prisoner. I repent, I'm guilty before you. You see, my youngest daughter asked me to bring her the scarlet flower. How could I deny her that? She's my most loved daughter. Let me go and bid farewell to my daughters. I'll be back, you have my word of a merchant. Let me go. All right, go. But I won't find the way back to you. Here's my ring, put it on your small finger. You are to be back in three days. Father! Oh, father, I have been waiting for you all day and all night. Forgive me, father! Why, you're not happy, daughter? Why don't you take the flower you so longed for? There's nothing more beautiful in the whole world. I'm stepping on the grass... I'm stepping on the grass... I'm walking in the field... I'm walking in the field... Oh, upon that green grass... I'll be walking on and on... It's the third day now. Let's not let our father go to the beast. - How can we live without father? - We can't live without father. Why don't you cheat the beast? Drop his ring in a well, as if you have lost it. Or we can move back the clock's hands. No, daughters, I gave him my word of a merchant. Father! How can you leave us alone?! No, we won't let you go, father! Come, come, stop it. How are you going to get there? I'll put this ring on my finger, and I'll be there. That's all my fault. Goodbye! Where are you? Forest beast! I brought you the scarlet flower. You must forgive my father, but I came instead of him. Where are you? Here, take back your magic ring. Keep it. Don't be scared of me! Don't be afraid. Wait. Wait, don't run away! You will never see me. What is your name? - What is your name? - Alyona. And what is yours? I've got no name. I'm not a human being. Don't be afraid. Did you get lost in our forest? She's not bad. Pale complexion, pink cheeks, a swan's neck. Not bad, but not to my taste. Oh God, I'm sick and tired of him and his guests! Nobody is asking you, Madam. - Old fool! - Old witch! Aren't you ashamed of enticing an innocent creature? - She came here by herself. - And she will leave by herself. You can't sleep, can you? I feel scared here, at your place. I'm seeing dreams. I wonder, is it a shaggy beast you're dreaming of? At our place you will see even worse things in your dreams. Well, go on seeing your dreams at night. But don't peek into windows. In old time guests were received differently here. With balls, masquerades, fireworks! It's you again! Who else can it be here? You won't solve your problem with a quill, nor will you start a fire. Warm or cold, what difference does it make? I don't care. You don't care! That is your pride speaking, Madam. What can you know, stupid lackey? You just feel like chatting. It's so dull here, so desolate. And it's all your doing. You may go wherever you wish, if you're bored. Nobody keeps you here. I would, but I can't. What will happen to them then? You care about everything. Why did you put our poor prince under a spell? I think it's because you loved him. What do you know about love, old fool? Come to the window. Where are you? Show up. I feel scared in this palace. I want out. Talk to me. Put on the ring, and you'll be back home. Where are you? I will teach you how to tell fortunes and prophesy. Then whatever you wish will come true. I want to see the one I've come to. You will see him, if you wish it so much. As soon as he finishes knitting that robe for the beast, you'll see him. She will see him. - Is that she? - Yes, that's her. She used to be a beauty. In those times everything was different here. And what do we have now? She stamps her foot, she shouts. And at whom? Just torturing herself. Come with me, I'll tell you about her. Madam, do you love him? Who? The beast? - You're not asleep, aren't you? - No. Come to the window, talk to me. I would love to talk to you, but you're hiding all the time. Stop hiding. I need to see you. Show to me what you look like. No, no, I'm ugly, and you're beautiful. I want to see you. You've got a kind voice. I scare everyone. I won't be scared. Hello! Hello! Is that you? Show me your eyes. I promise I won't be scared. Forgive me. Where are you? Answer me. Where are you hiding? Where are you? I'll find you anyway. Why are you hiding from me? I'm not afraid of you. I was only a little scared the first time. Believe me, I'm not afraid of you at all. Are you hiding again? I'm not hiding, I'm looking at you. I remember a young man singing a song about love. He was singing about a happy butterfly. The butterfly was so carefree that it didn't notice how it died. It died and said, "I'm leaving grief to the others." He finished his song, and everybody laughed. Why? In old time, they used to laugh on any occasion. Everybody laughed and ran off in different directions. Don't you want to run away, too? Everybody ran away, some from fear, some from horror. Who would want to be a friend of a beast. A beast, a monster. - But the grandfather stayed. - He's ready to serve anyone. And what about you? Me? Me! This is a long story. Anyway, I like peace and quiet. I've solved many a mystery in my solitude. If you wish, I'll tell you about it some day... About how all the happy stories end. Where are you? And I was wondering why this terrible draught. You should go to bed, old geezer. You're troubling yourself all in vain. One has to pay for evil doing. You forgot how to do witchcraft anyway. You grew skinny and vicious, but you still watch and do your witchery. - It's you? - Yes, it's me. I dozed off, too. Do you see nice dreams? I was dreaming of my father. He misses me. Your father! I know what you, young girls, have on your mind. What you're waiting for, what you would go to the end of the world for. - No, you don't know. - I don't? It's love! Love! Take my advice: run from here. What do you need him for? He's a beast, a monster! I can give you a book with cabalistic signs. Or I can teach you fortune-telling. Or I can show you a lucky star that will always direct you. But you must run away from here. Tell me, what do you need him for? I can't leave, I feel so sorry for him. She pities a beast! A beast! Love! Love! Where is it, your love? There's no love here, because he has no heart. Didn't you know it? It's so dull here, so lonesome. You know, sometimes I feel sorry for him, too. He had no heart before, either. That's why he's so ugly. Tell me, will you remember me sometimes? Remember you? I'll die without you! What? Are you going... to leave? You're free to go. You've got the ring. I'll just see my father and be back. - He won't let you go back. - I won't tell him I'm going. I'll be back before the day is out. Tomorrow at midnight. Tomorrow at midnight. I'll be back. As my darling came back from the field... He did tether his horse at the door... He did tether his horse at the door, And he was all in tears himself... Are you awake, daughter? He's missing me over there. You mean the beast? Of course, he's kind, he let you go, we thank him for that. But he's a beast anyway. From now on we'll live happily! You got so beautiful! There will be no end of suitors, we'll marry you off. All right, go to bed. Go and lie down. Go to sleep. Things will look better in the morning. - What a shame to cheat father! - She's hiding her ring. - Something's stirring. - Where? I'm scared! Can it be Alyona's beast? - There it goes again. - No, that's the dough rising. No, it's not. Devil, he scared me out of my wits! It's almost midnight, and we're not sleeping yet. We must not let Alyona go to the beast. Let's stop the clock. - While they're sleeping? - Yes. Come on, hurry. Quiet! You'll wake them up. That's it. Quiet. Let's sleep. Maybe he's not a beast? I'll die without you... Where are you? Answer me! I'm back! Why couldn't you wait for me? Why did I ask my father to bring me the scarlet flower? Why did he go about his wanderings? Why did I meet you, and why did I lose you? Why should I live without you? Why? I love you! I love you as my most desired prince! Where are you going? Why? Tonight we'll have a ball, a masquerade, fireworks! The master asked you to attend his wedding. He didn't understand anything! Don't tell him I was crying. The master has forgiven you. I'm not crying, I'm just happy about leaving that hole. Madam, it's wonderful that you're crying! It means you might get back your kind heart. On a day like that we must not bear grudges. Shut up! Ask him if he remembers a girl with a red flower in her hair? Does he remember how she gave it to him and he just laughed? Big deal! Laughed! Love forgives even worse things. - It means there was no love. - What can you know about love? No one knows anything about love. But it must bring happiness. Here's your peacock and your turtle. Go! To think that without me, this wedding would've never happened. It all began with me. How can I let her go? She will do something crazy again, she'll catch a cold, she'll cough. I can't let her go until she gets back her kind heart. Madam, wait! I'm going with you. They will be fine without me here. Why are you hiding? I'm not hiding, I'm looking at you. And I'm looking at you. The End
