Jim Till. October 27th. I feel I better start recording what's been going on around here because I fear I'm losing my mind but I'm not crazy. There are orbs here. I seen like, three of 'em. They're like those transparent balls you see on TV and in photographs. I'm not going crazy, but like on the precipice. Something's going on in my head. January 27th. It's three AM. I followed a little girl into the warehouse here. Where is she? I need to talk to her. Little girl? Where are you? Where are you... Little girl! They make you see things that you don't wanna see. They make you do things that you don't wanna do. They like to make you afraid. Whatever scares you the most... they know what it is. I think I pissed them off. June seventh. Something's up. They're coming back. They're coming again. They're, like, inside my head. I gotta get into this tank. I'll be safe in this tank. Ah! No! Ah! Ah, aah! Come on, come on, come on! My name is Jim Till. I'm an assistant professor of theoretical physics at Stanford and I've encountered a phenomenon that I can't explain. I came through this door and I looked to my left and sitting right around there, by those boxes at the very end, was aa woman dressed in black. Babe, we gotta go. Come on, pack it up. See this guy. - He's Ashen's brother. -Wow? - Ashen has an older brother. - Okay? - Ashen, from the winery? -I know who Ashen is. Why are you treating it like it's some conspiracy that he has an older brother? Dax, he talked to us for an hour about his family and not once did he mention he had a brother, let alone one that's a theoretical physicist. I mean, don't you think that's a little strange? No, I don't. Self-centered little rich pricks don't like to gloat about their more accomplished siblings. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm just so excited about this. This is an amazing, amazing opportunity. Out of all the paranormal investigators, we were the first to be chosen to investigate one of the most haunted places in the United States. Do you know why? Because Ashen has a hard on for you. Yes, and because I'm a kick ass producer. And you're very humble. Drink this. I don't think you need it but This is coffee. Yes, it is. Very good coffee. I can't have coffee. It's not good for the baby. Shit. I'm sorry. I know. I keep forgetting. You keep forgetting? Wow. That makes me feel all fuzzy inside. Stop. Can you have tea? - Can I get you tea? -Yes, I can have tea. Decaf? Organic? Baby friendly? Anything else? Come on. Let's go! Little bit of eye candy for the network execs, because they tend to like that kinda thing. Yeah. Actually, I think this is Mike's first and last day with us, right? All right, and that's my loving girlfriend. - Okay. -Mike. - I got you a coffee. -Oh, nice. Thank you, brother. And you are... Hi, I'm Jason Meeks and this is a digital voice recorder for capturing EVPs. Or... recording ghosty ghosts. And have you ever recorded one? I believe I have. On several occasions. With all the cell phones polluting our airwaves, you're still convinced that what you're hearing are ghosts? Sarah's a little bit of a skeptic and also a little bit of a ho-bag. Jason still believes in the tooth fairy. For the record, I stopped believing in the tooth fairy months ago. And what do you do here? I'm Maya Peterson. I'm the sound dude. Mike. Mike. Mike? Could you not do that, please? Use the fish eye lens. Mike! Stop! Tilt/shift that ass! Theresa! Hi, I'm Sarah Hall and I'm standing in front of the King's Ransom Winery, located in Guerneville, California. King's Ransom is widely considered as one of the most haunted places in the United States, and not until now has any paranormal investigations been allowed. No. You know what? Since we're stopped, I need to check the white balance. Maya? Awesome. Thanks, baby. Should I take from the top, or just where I stopped? - Keep going. We're gonna cut in. -No, no, no. Take it from the top, you're doing great. We're gonna take it from the top. Okay, ow. Hi, I'm Sarah Hall and I'm standing in front of the King's Ransom Winery, located in Guerneville, California. King's Ransom is widely considered as one of the most haunted places in the United States. This is the only weekend out of the entire year that the winery is closed down, and the owner, Ashen Till, has given us full access. So for the next 48 hours, we have this entire place to ourselves. It actually used to be a logging company before it became a winery. That's my great-grandfather. And this was his wife, Rachel. So that's the famous Rachel Till. She's beautiful. She was the first suicide. When was that? 1932. They said that she heard voices. She stabbed herself to death... Thirteen times. How does somebody stab themselves 13 times? You think after the first one, they'd be like "ow," you know, and stop. You'd think. And who else committed suicide? Rory Devink, my grandfather's second wife. And how did she kill herself? She also stabbed herself to death. The same way. Thirteen times? I'm not sure how many. And what about the third girl? Beatrice Blaine. But she was murdered. Tell me about that. It was 1972. Her father Joe Blaine, he was a machinist working here. They say that he raped her. And evidently he got her pregnant, and to cover it up, he killed her. How? He threw her down on these blades. Pretty gruesome. You think there may be a demonic presence here? I mean, that's a really evil thing to do. I don't know about that. I mean, I definitely think Joe Blaine was a disturbed individual. And what's the auger for? It's how we crush the grapes. Okay, so, so far we have the two suicides and a murder, so we're missing the third suicide. Supposedly after Joe murdered his daughter, he went into his office and shot himself in the head... 13 times. It was a joke. So the house was built in the 1800s. The late 1800s. When we were kids, my brother Jim dared us to spend the night here. That's a beautiful piano over there. What year is that? It's 1870s. Square grand. Made out of rosewood. I wouldn't touch it. And this, uh... this was Rory Devink's bedroom. Your grandfather's... - ...second wife. -Second wife. Yeah. But she hardly stayed here. She was paranoid that the world was coming to an end and she built a bomb shelter and literally lived in it. I guess she went a little nuts because she started dining on rats. Ew... And where is this bomb shelter? The entrance is in the garden behind the house. So this is the room that you and Rebi stayed in? I did, but Rebi, sheshe stayed in a room across the hall. Rachel Till's old room. It was the middle of the night. I heard her screaming and I got up and I ran through here... ...and I saw her standing on the bed looking at me like she was possessed. Maybe she was messing with you? No. Did you ever ask her what that was about? She died not long after the incident. I'm so sorry. Can I ask how? Car crash. Maya, rig a light. What are you guys doing? You unscrew the flashlight just enough for a ghost to be able to turn it on. Yeah, so if the flashlight comes on it means that you're probably going to die. Hey! Upstairs is off limits. What? My sister's stuff's up there and my dad would freak. Besides it's locked and I don't have a key. We're paranormal investigators that can't go into the attic... Yeah. Sorry. Dax, we don't need to get up there. Yes, we do. We specifically asked to go into the attic and now all of a sudden we can't. Sorry. Thank you. So how many acres is it? Three thousand, three hundred sixty of it vineyard land. About eight square miles, with two miles surrounding us. So Ashen, when are we getting married? Sarah's a little bit of a gold digger, I should warn you. So how long have you two been friends? - Since we were kids. -We grew up on the same street. So, in this stomach is a baby boy or a baby girl. You really don't know? I want it to be a surprise. What are you hoping for? A lesbian. - Just like her mom. -Yeah, you know, thanks to you, I'm seriously considering going there. Wouldn't be the first time. Well, I think Theresa is gonna make a rockin' mom. Thank you. So what is Dax's problem? We've just been having a stupid argument. We've been having it ever since I became pregnant. Dax thinks that the baby was conceived in LA, and Theresa thinks that the baby was conceived here. - At this winery? -Yep. We came up here a few of months ago just to scout locations and get permission to ghost hunt. Grabbed a couple of bottles of wine. Went for a hike along the property line. Got totally drunk. Don't remember making love but we were completely trashed, so... Got it. This place is awesome, right? Compared to that ratted out asylum we investigated? - That asylum was gross. -And dormant. How many investigations have you guys done so far? This'll be our fourth but the other three were lame. - Very lame. -How does it work? I mean, do you sell it to a network or something? Well, right now just the internet but we're stepping up our game. We invested some more money in gear and we just hired Mike, our newest ghost hunter. You're awesome by the way. I like to think so. If you need to make a call, you're better off using a land line. Yeah, the service here sucks. I told my old man to put in his own cell tower, but he thinks that the microwaves contaminate the grapes. - Boo! -There you are. Just wanted to see how these new EMFs were working. Any spikes? Ah, no. Nothing. Maybe I'll sneak around by myself and try to get some footage away from the... Do what you gotta do. Just be discreet, okay? I promised Ashen we wouldn't run amok. Got it. One of our employees thought the place was demon possessed. Tried to burn it down when I was a kid. Barely got out of here with my life. My dad drank himself to sleep with a cigarette in his mouth. Ran out of the house, forgot about me. Solid year in the hospital on a morphine diet getting skin grafts. Pain was so much fun I left my body. Is that why you ghost hunt? I've seen the other side. I know it's real. You ready? You can put your gear in the museum. Just don't scratch anything. What the hell is this? What do you think it is? You know how I feel about guns. Mike. We're up here all by ourselves. You don't want a little bit of protection? Okay, but you can't shoot a ghost and there's nobody here. Yeah, that's a perfect time to rob the place. Maya. Mike... So we've just finished the tour and everyone's getting prepped for our first investigation. We're gonna start with the original winery, the part that's over a hundred years old. If there's something here, we're gonna find it. I've been looking through these videos. They're uploaded by Jim Till, Ashen Till's older brother. He talks about these balls of light. Now, they're pretty common in photographs. They're usually just specks of dust on the lens. But if he's seen these in person... Gotta make a note to ask Ashen about his brother. Maybe I can get an interview. Maybe he can help us. I've got a really, really good feeling about this place. I mean, there is so much dark history here. There's an abundance of violent deaths and all sorts of unexplainable phenomena. Why are these candles lit? Uh, Theresa? Was someone else down here? 'Cause these candles are lit. Maybe Jason. I'll check with him. Jason, did you light any candles? Why would I light candles? Copy that. That's a negative from Jason. Great. Yeah, I just walked into a cold spot right here. Okay. Well, check your TG. Fifty-nine... Fifty-four... Forty-nine... Are you joking? Yeah. Ha ha. We're not gonna find anything down here. What makes you so sure about that? They all killed themselves. Suicide's a straight shot to hell. It's pretty black and white in your Catholic world, huh? Uh huh. Unfinished business is unfinished business. Rachel, I hope we're not intruding. We just want to understand you. - What's on the EVP? -Huh? Are you running an EVP? Oh, that's probably a good idea. I just hate hearing my voice recorded. Rachel, why did you stab yourself 13 times? And why in the stomach? Why such a painful and slow death? Were you trying to get someone's attention? Sweetheart, you have our attention, so go ahead and tell us. I like to flirt with my ghosts. If you're here, give us a sign. Come on, ya crazy bitch. Run an EVP. Rachel, if you have anything to say, I can hear you with this device. Tell us why you killed yourself. We want to know. We want to know your story. We want to know. We want to know your story. That sounded like something, right? Uh, guys? I'm getting, um... EMF readings in this dining room. He's in the old boardroom. On the basement floor. Jason? You're in the old boardroom. What kind of readings are you getting? Pretty consistent at 2.5 with... spikes all the way up to 7. Seven? Yeah. All right, is somebody fucking with me? No, no. What's going on? The door just moved. And it just got really fucking cold in here. Okay, 68... 65... 62... 50... That's like a 10 degree drop. That, that's for real. Are you guys picking that up? Do you hear that? No. What are you hearing? I hear scratching. Hold on a second. Play that back. So how long have you and Dax been together? Um, three to three and a half years, I guess. He's kind of a short fuse. Yeah, I guess. Maya. To the left of you? That's where they found Rachel's corpse. Hey, what's goin' on? Shh. We got a positive EVP. Theresa, is anybody else in the winery? Is there anyone else here? I'm gonna go check it out. I saw somebody walk past here. Are you sure it couldn't have been something else? No, I saw it too. If you've got a message for me, tell me what it is. ...message for me, tell me what it is. Okay, I got something. Are you sure? Fuck yeah. I'm gonna listen to it again. ...message for me, tell me what it is. Jesus! What's going on? A lot of shit, man. Oh God. Hey. Sorry. Oh God. What'd you see? Right through here. We saw a shadow of somebody walk past, Mike. - You scared? -Well, if it's a ghost, then no, but if it's an intruder with a knife that's gonna tie me up and murder me, then yes. I don't think it was an intruder. This place is the real deal, isn't it? Sounds like "fuck you." Yeah, I was gonna say the same thing. That's what I heard. No, I'm hearing "they." "They fuck you." That's lovely. Play my EVP. I hear "go" and "idge." Play it again. Grids? Go to the ridge? Go to the fridge? Fridge? She's hungry? Maybe we should go make her a sandwich. So what do you think? I think we might sell our first show to a network. I just felt a kick. - Let me feel! -I just felt a kick! That's so exciting! Yeah. Hey. You got another one of those? I thought you quit. Live dangerously. You all right? I'm not cut out for this shit, man. I'm... I don't know how to deal with it. It's "like father, like son," no matter how much I resist. You and Maya are good though, huh? Yeah, she thinks so. You don't? It's perfect, like, we don't argue. No problems. That's the problem. We don't fight. We don't laugh. You don't fuck. Yeah, man, I've been in that relationship. You guys are more like brother and sister. Exactly. Brother and sister? Hi... Prick. Ask and you shall receive. Go get her, man. This is video surveillance footage from inside the bottle factory. Oh shit, that's spooky. Pay attention to the courtyard shot. Wait. Can you pause it a second? What year was this taken? '93. And that's not your sister? She died a year before. It could have been a visitor, right? You said the winery does tours? I think that girl is Beatrice Blaine. The girl from the auger? Yeah. Creepy. Have you posted any of this on the net? Jim might have. All he does is tweak out and post videos on YouTube. He's a tweaker? He's a total loser. My dad, he lets him park his trailer on our land. I don't know why. He should cut him off, but now that he's sick, he won't. He thinks he's gonna run this place with me. It's not gonna happen. Would you like to join us, Dax? What are you doing back there? I'm just watching the footage. What is your problem? Why do I have to have a problem? We have 48 hours to do this, right? Whoa. Definite overanalyzing. I'm just sitting back. I don't like to sit close to the screen. - I'm sorry. -Should we do this another time? - No, please. -No, please give us a second. - Let's just watch. No. -You don't direct everything, Theresa, thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you. You wanna see something disgusting? I think that's a three-week-old cookie. - Want some? -No. No? You're full? How long have those cookies even been in there? I don't know. A really long time. Do you think that, um, Ashen likes me? I don't think that you want to know what I think about that. Why don't you try dating someone that gets you? Someone that gets me? You know, instead of these jerks that just use you and then spit you out? Come on, we have been friends for so long. I don't wanna ruin that. Yeah... Look me in the eyes and tell me right now that you've not been with anybody else. I never cheated on you, Dax, all right? - I didn't. -Why? Because we were broken up? I swear on this baby's life that you're the father. - Here we go again. -What do you want? You want a relationship like Dax and Theresa? You're venting to somebody about our problems. Because you don't talk to me. Is it so wrong that I don't wanna fight? You respond to fights. We don't have to fight. You just keep on dating your rich father, who abused you. Excuse me? Do you remember that night when you were walking down the street with this crazed look on your face? How dare you bring that up? How dare you? Do you remember what we said to each other that night? You can't just talk about that shit. You can't just bring that shit up. You're always looking to someone else. You want that negative attention, and I'm catching you. That's what this is about? You catching me? Things would be a little more cut and dry... Tell me the truth. You don't know how I would react. Dax, we came up here to location scout. That's the only time it could've happened. - Stop. -Don't fucking ask me that. Stop it right now. I'm not trying to fucking hurt you. I'm not the one tr Don't you ever talk about that again. You promised you would never. Out of the seven people that are here out of the seven people that are here, who have you told about your cousin blowing his head off with your gun? Because I guarantee you told someone. No! But the fact that we don't fight and the fact that we don't talk about our messed up past bothers you. I tried, I said I'd come to you, I say, but "No, I'm too busy, I have to focus on work." Dax, I know, I know I tend to get consumed with my job and with my goals and the things I want to accomplish in life but I'm not gonna stop doing the things I want to do in life because you feel threatened. Fuck you, Jason, you know? Fuck you. Why the fuck are you even talking to me? Don't fucking talk to me. Are you fucking kidding me? Maya. Maya! Get your ass back here! The baby is yours Dax, okay? We need to calm down. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure you stay calm this weekend. Just breathe. Wine, wine, everywhere, nor any drop to drink. Ah. Not bad. Don't get us in trouble, okay? I doubt they're gonna miss one little bottle of wine. I'm gonna go check out the bomb shelter. You go back to the old Till house. Okay? You read my mind. Rory Devink. "This much time underground..." Oh my God. Who's there? "Rachel knows how to make..." "They know..." "Go away..." "Rachel knows how to make them go away." So I just found something really, really cool. I had a good feeling about this place and King's Ransom does not disappoint. We've had positive EVPs, dramatic temperature swings, EMFs that are all over the place... There is something here. I looked around in Rory Devink's bomb shelter and I found this. It's her diary. It's mostly just incoherent, but look at this. "Rachel... knows how to make them go away." What does that mean? Who are "they," you know? Maybe there's something that Ashen isn't telling us. Maybe there's something else hidden in these videos. So this is the old Till house. It's off-limits to the family for whatever reason. It's my belief that ghosts are shy. And they like it when it's dark. And they like it when you're alone. And they like it when you're scared. We definitely have all three of those things happening right now. This place definitely... gives me the creeps. There's the old piano. Rachel? If you're here, play something on the piano. I'll start you off. Okay, what was that? Okay, I definitely heard a noise. Could have been a pinecone coming off the roof... Or not. Okay, something just rolled down the stairs. What is that? What's... Oh my God, it's an eye. Okay, that's fucked up. That fucking door is unlocked. Hello? You all right? Yeah. Is it me, or do you get the sense that there's something up with Ashen? - Like what? -I dunno. It's like every time he talks about his dead sister or his brother, he gets this this weird look on his face. - I haven't really noticed it. - I mean, think about it. What's this winery worth? I can't count that high. With his sister dead, his brother is the only thing standing in the way of him inheriting this whole place. I mean, he hates his brother. You can hear it all over him. Well his brother's a drug addict. Yeah, he's probably hoping he ODs. You don't know that. He said his sister died in a car accident. I wonder who was driving. These fucking dolls. Who makes this shit? There's writing all over this wall. Not nice things. It's definitely not... a good feeling in here. What is this here? Not a bad artist. Vineyards... the Till house... Don't like that one. Whoa, what is this? This is your notebook? What the hell was that? Rebi? You've got to be kidding me. Looks like someone decapitated a bunch of dolls and put them in a bathtub. Let's check out this room. It's so cold in here. There's dust everywhere. What the fuck... Okay, that's a leg. What is this? Peek-a-boo... Okay. The door just moved. Did you do that? Did you do that? Okay, who's screwing with me? Oh shit. Oh, shit! What happened? Stop it! Oh, shit! It's out there in the woods. It's an entity. I can't really explain. It picked me up, literally picked me up off the ground. It's strong, it's like Do you really think I killed my sister? You know the next time you want to have a private conversation, try turning your headset off. I'm sorry, Ashen. I can get paranoid I didn't kill Rebi. I loved my sister. I love my brother, too. I have nightmares to this day about that crash. That's the truth. Do you know why you're here, Theresa? To hunt for ghosts. To prove their existence. Not to me. So please... stay focused on what's important. Okay. Maybe we can fight a little. Whoa. You all right? You okay? What happened? - Baby? -No, I'm good. I'm just tired, I guess. Whoa. That's substantial. Check this out. Check the meter. See where it is? - Mm-hm. -Watch this. It's weird. It's like this room just, like, feels creepy. Somebody's becoming a believer. No, I'm not saying that. It just feels weird. Look at these pictures. They're of the Till family. People always look funny from these times. You two look rosy. - We went for a walk. -A walk? I don't want to see you after a run then. What do you got? We got fluctuations up to five. It's spiking. Dax. Go back for a second to that other picture. Which one? This one? No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, the other one. The one of the room? Look at this. This is the room we're in, right? - Yeah. -Look. There's a door where that armoire is. No, that's the door we just walked through. No, no, no. Look. If you look at the layout of the furniture, it would put this door... right here. This is where I'm getting the strongest reading. Is it okay if we move this? Let's do it. Wonder why it was covered up. I have no idea. It's been like that since I was a kid. I know that. That's super creepy. Oh wow. Oh my God. Mike, do you have enough light to get this? Careful what you touch. I'm not sure you should be touching things. Smells like dead rats in here. Guys, this paint is still wet. Look at these paintings, you guys. Check out all this writing. It comes all the way over here too. Bridge... "Now I go to the summer bridge..." to meet the devil? God. Shit. Hello? Dad? Dad, I'm gonna call you later from a land line, okay? Summer bridge... Are you getting service? Yeah, like one bar. Guys. You guys, you guys. The bridge. That's what the EVP was saying. "Now I go to the bridge." He shouldn't just be wandering around, especially now with us not having any cell service. - I'm sure he's close by. -I'm sure he's close, but we don't have time for this. We've got a tight schedule. Speak of the devil. Hey. Hey! Where the hell you been? I went for a little walk to clear my head. What's goin' on? Okay, well, nice of you to join us. Come on, we got a big lead. Let's go. This way. Why doesn't Ashen ever have to carry anything? So what's the deal with this bridge? Rebi and I used to play here when we were kids. And this is where she died. Careful, guys. Can I ask you what exactly happened? When I found Rebi, she was convulsing and speaking in a language that I didn't understand, and... I couldn't find anyone to help me. So I tried to drive her to the hospital but she forced us to crash. She wasn't belted in and she went face first through the windshield. You were driving? Yeah. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. -Don't do that. - That's not funny. -Chill out. I was joking. Jason's scared of the water. Oh my God. Oh my God, guys, look down there. There's someone down there. There's a woman down there. All right, guys, stay here. Mike, come on. Let's go, let's go. - Hello? -Getting anything, Mike? I can't see anything down here. Where did she see her? Somewhere around here. This is the spot right here. Anyone there? Anything? Maya? Maya! Sarah? Sarah? Sarah? Sarah! Sarah! - Hey hey, what do we got? - Sarah's down there? - How? -He pushed her. He pushed her in! What the hell is wrong with you, man? She was gonna jump. I tried to grab her. Bullshit. I saw you. I did not! She was gonna jump! You're such a fucking liar. You pushed her in. The current is strong. We've got to get down there. Let's go. She should be here. It seems shallow. Somebody needs to go back to the winery and call the fucking police. I'll go. Take the girls. Grab the equipment. Let's keep looking. Come on, come on, come on! What? I can't get an outside line. All right, we'll go to town. Come on. Fuck. Go inside. I'll fix it. Wait, why? Go inside. I really think that tire was slashed. No! What's wrong? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. All this stress isn't good for the baby, that's all. I don't like this. I'm checking on Mike. Mike? Mike! Nobody gets out of here. Pull the trigger. - We're all gonna die. -Pull the trigger. Do it! - Mike! -Oh my God. Mike, Mike! I get reception in the cellar. We can go down there. Mike, look at me. Mike. Mike. Maya? Maya? Maya? Maya? Maya? They genetically bred out fear. Who are you talking to? Theresa. I'm talking to you. Sarah? Sarah? This is impossible. Sarah! I didn't push her in. Why would I fucking push her in? - Why would I do that? -Why would she jump? I don't know, man. - Why would she jump? -I don't know! Let's not lose our heads, okay? I swear to God, man. I swear to fucking God I didn't push her in. Let's find Sarah. We'll ask her what happened. Can anyone hear me? You getting that? Sarah. Can you hear me? Hello? Can you hear me? Is anyone there? I can hear you. Can you hear me? Barely. I'm at this road and I see wooden shacks. Wooden shacks? She must be back at the winery. Sarah, listen. Stay where you are. We're coming for you. Sarah, can you hear me? Why aren't we getting reception? Because her radio's wet. We're lucky we're getting anything at all. I'm gonna go look for her. Go. I'm coming with you. Listen, you stay here in case she comes around, all right? You stay in contact. You stay in contact. Do you understand me? Yeah. There's definitely something evil here. The phone lines were cut and our tires were slashed. Maya's missing... Mike... There's only one person who knows what's going on here. I'm gonna find Jim Till. Hello? Hello? Is anybody here? Hello? Jim? Hello? Oh my God. That's disgusting. Orbs... They bred out fear. Man's been enslaved by these demonic forces. They're able to navigate between the physical and the astral plane. They're technologically and physically superior to us. Religion calls them demons. Ufologists call them multidimensional beings. What's relevant is they're trying to assimilate us into their fascist empire run! And parasitically deplete us of our physical and biological resources. They've been exploiting mankind for thousands of years you listen to me! Carefully manifesting this abduction hybrid breeding program. And they want to be portrayed as saviors while mankind goes mad... Listen to me! Listen. To. Me. You're not fucking listening to me. Listen to me! Hey Dax? Mike? Can you guys hear me? I can't stay here by myself. I'm going insane. I'm gonna go back to the winery and look for her. Sarah? Sarah? Sarah? Oh my God. Oh my God. Are you okay? Where have you been? Here. Put this on. Put this on. You're freezing. What happened? What happened? Look at me. - Sarah. -They're beautiful. Sarah, look at me. Look at me. Okay, we gotta go this way, all right? - We're gonna go this way. -No. Come with me. Sarah? - Come. -No! Sarah, come on! Sarah! Sarah. Sarah. Sarah. Sarah, we're at the shack. Come outside. Sarah, do you read me? Where is she? Is there any other place she could be? I don't know. - These the only wooden shacks? - Shh, shh, shh, shh. What? Did you just hear that? Sarah? Now what? Where? It's nothing. Let's go. All right. Sarah? Sarah? Sarah. We've been looking all over for you. Sarah. You pushed me. Sarah. No. You pushed me off the bridge. You fell. I tried to save you. No, you tried to kill me! You tried to kill me! Sarah, I would never hurt you. Sarah, I... Why would I ever want to hurt you? I'm in love with you. Jason? Hello? Who's there? - Beatrice? -They are too real. Hello? Fine. Don't believe me. They make you see things you don't wanna see. They make you do things that you don't wanna do. Beatrice? What'd I say about your imaginary friend? She's real. What the hell did you do? What I had to. What the hell did you do?! Talk to Rachel. She knows how to make them go away. Jesus Christ! Daddy! Beatrice? Ashen! Yeah, yeah? We gotta get her to the hospital right now. We gotta go right now. Get the door. Stay calm, Theresa. Just be careful. I want you to stay calm and relax and focus on the baby right now. I need you to be quiet because she needs to stay calm. Just stay calm. Just breathe. Stay warm. All right, go, go, go. - I need you to breathe. -We need to find Rachel. - Are you having contractions? - We have to go find Rachel. There's something else here. Okay, just relax, all right? It's okay. Hey. Kill her. How far are we from the hospital? No, no, no, no. - Dax. -Yeah? - In the glove box. -Yeah? I need you to get me something. Look at me. You're gonna be fine. I'm here, okay? I love you. Hang on! Dax. Dax! Come on, come on, come on. Please, Dax. Come on. Oh my God. Ah, my legs! Come on! Come on. Go! No! No! Don't let me burn. Don't let me burn. Please! Please! Please! Get up! Get on your fucking feet! Get out of my head. Please let me go. Kill her. I'm sorry. 911. What's the nature of your emergency? I need help. Miss, what is your emergency? My best friend is dead. Dead? Are you sure? What is your location? Miss, I need you to remain calm. What is your location? I'm at the King's Ransom Winery. I don't know what happened. Are you sure your friend is dead? Can you tell me what happened? Hello? I think I killed him. You think you killed him? Miss, did I hear you correctly? Miss? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me, miss? Are you there? Miss? I'm dispatching emergency crews right away. I need you to stay on the line, okay? Hello? Are you there? Miss? I can help you. Come this way. Theresa. Theresa, come over here. Step in there. It's safe in there. They like to make you afraid. Whatever scares you the most, they know what it is. What do they want? Rachel can tell you. You have to talk to her. It's the only way. Yeah. Have you seen them? No. What do they look like? They're beautiful. Are you afraid? That's what they like. I'm scared too. But they can't hurt you, can they? Yeah. But in a different way. I'm gonna go see where they are. You stay. Okay? Run! Ma'am, were you are you taking something? What's going on? Calm down. We need an 11-41. What are you doing? What are you doing? Don't go in there! Don't let him go in there. It's okay. He'll be okay. He'll be okay. I'll be right back. In case I don't make it out alive, I want everyone to know what's going on. There's something here. It's not human. It's not a ghost. It's a beautiful light but there's something sinister at its core. And there's only one person that knows how to make it go away. That's Rachel Till. And I'm gonna find her. Rachel? Rachel?! I'm here. Why are they trying to kill me? I used to be beautiful like you. If they wanted me dead, I'd be dead by now, wouldn't I? What do they want? They bred out fear, which is the foundation of all emotion. Without emotion there's no desire to breed, to explore, no will to live. They are dying. So they come here on occasion to study it and... extract it. Extract it... how? What is living inside you is not human, and if it is born... God help us. They're gonna take my baby. Aren't they? I stopped them. Rory and Beatrice stopped them. Now you must... stop them. Take it. Theresa! Theresa? Are you here? I don't think she's here. Help. Help me. Please. Is that her? I dunno. Why'd you stab yourself? What? I need a doctor. Please. Help me. What happened to your friends? They're all fucking dead. They're all fucking dead. Holy shit. Did you hear that? Yeah. That's crazy. No, wait. Wait, please. Hey, what the fuck was that? I dunno. And I don't wanna find out. Let's get out of here.
