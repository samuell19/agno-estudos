I hope you all have a merry Christmas, and I'm sending you the last song. Minhee, let's hold this togeth- Minhee! Hello. Give it to me. I'll hold it for you No, it's okay. Give it to me. It's not that difficult. I'll hold it until the elevator, Yeongwoo noona. Sorry? [Seo Yeongwoo] Right. You don't mind if I call you noona right? Yeah, well.. I usually call every older women by noona. Also because I'm an only child, I always thought "I wish I had an older sister". If I call you noona we can get along easily, and isn't the word noona sounds very friendly? It's sounds somewhat warm and friendly. Thank you for saying that. You're even helping me with my stuffs. No. It's not a big deal. I talked a lot today, right? That's because I'm always alone. I watch movies alone, and I eat alone. I'll hold it... At home and here. So when someone's next to me, I just want to talk to them. So please understand. Sometimes I can't say a word all day. But these days I... Thank you. I was more grateful to you for talking with me, Yeongwoo noona. Minhee, you remember the stuff that I told you the other day? Are you done? No...not yet. The due is tomorrow morning, send it to my e-mail. Yes, Ma'am. One more thing... Can you not use earphones and Kakao Talk at work? Okay. [That witch is acting up again. What's wrong with her????] Finish it by the end of the week. It's possible right? Chief Choi... Yeah? This is the plan that we're going to do next year. I don't think we need to do it now. Do I have to report to my subordinate about the work? Why? You can't do this work? No. That's not what I meant. I have another work to finish by this week, and.. Ah...this week? Christmas? What about it? You want to enjoy the Christmas, too? But you don't have no one to enjoy it with. I told you that's not what I meant. The problem is if you got something to say, you talk a lot. Don't you think so? If I tell you to do something just do it. Finish it even if it means you have to pull an all nighter. [What is this?] [This is a rabbit and this is the rabbit's house.] What are you so surprised about? You haven't left yet? I was about to leave and then I saw the light is still on so... Let's see... Oh My Gosh...You've worked hard. It's all thanks to you, Chief Choi. I'm sorry. Sorry. Take a break and do it later. How about a cup of coffee? You should get your work done earlier next time. Sorry, Sir. Yeongwoo noona! I guess you're going home now. Yes, I am. Do you know? that you're the most hardworking person in this building? You're the most hardworking. But you always leave at 11 PM to 12 PM... Excuse me, can I see the recording of the CCTV in our office's pantry? What's wrong? What happened? Nothing. I was just wondering. I'll show you as much as you want. There are procedures. But it doesn't matter, -Because your request is the most important thing. -You must be so tired. Have some of these at least. You're giving it to me? It's nothing much. Goodbye. What do you mean "It's nothing"? Thank you. Ouch! What's wrong with this thing? Of course! You can play with auntie until I'm home. Do you want something? I have one in my mind, but I'm not telling you. Tell me! It's for christmas gift. A rabbit? A real rabbit? No. I told you we can't have pets. That's why I said I'm not telling you... You don't want anything else? I'll buy you something else. [reserved] You don't have another rabbit cake? We're in the middle of making it now. Can I make a reservation for the cake? Of course. I want to make a reservation. Wrap these separately, please. Yes, Ma'am. [You know what I mean, right?] When people are busy, it shouldn't be a problem to park in the disabled parking space. Don't you think so? You misunderstood. I'm reporting you. Report me? a security? Wow. Security these days act like they're the owner of the building. I bought you something because I feel bad for finishing my work until late everyday. We can't take this- And please give this to the man who works in night shift. I think he already went home. -I just saw him in the basement parking lot. -You did? He said he was going home... Okay. I'll give it to him later. Team Leader Cha, finish the report that I gave you yesterday by today. Yes, Sir. By the way, you have to apologize to me for what you did yesterday. But I don't want to. Then I'll take it as a serious matter. Do as you wish. But I don't know if you'll be able to do that. Team Leader Seo, don't you think Christmas this time will be so fun? Strangely, I have that hunch? By the way, don't you think you use too much perfume? Minhee, did you finish what I asked you to do yesterday? Ah...I think I need to work more on some parts... I told you to do it by this morning. Don't you want to go home today? Yes, Ma'am. I'm sorry. Why did she suddenly become so serious? You need to cut it out too. Don't sulk all the time. We're lucky to be working under the most competent team leader in our company What competent? she's working like a crazy dog... It's her job to do, Why is she blaming me for not getting off work? Is it because she's a widow? she's more evil now... Misook, did you know? Shinhye saw Chief Choi went to our office late last night. Who would be in the office at that time? Isn't it obvious? I'm sure it's just something about work. She said Chief Choi looked drunk. If you keep doing this..ah...you're so mean. Okay,okay. I promise I won't do it again. You happy now? [Phone rings] Hello? I can't go. Yeah, you guys have fun. Send me your work and you can go home. Really?Okay. Enjoy your Christmas. Yes. You too, Ma'am. Yes, auntie. Is Jaein is doing fine? Yes, I'll be late. I'm Sorry. I'll be home soon. I think you can go home. Hi, My love. Okay, I know. I bought you a rabbit cake. I'll be home in a minute so wait for me a little bit. Youngwoo noona, are you okay? What happened? You would've been in big trouble if I hadn't been watching you. You got electrocuted because of the cable that fell from the ceiling in the parking lot. Suddenly, the power went out. I went to check it out, and I saw you were laying on the ground. I was so scared for you. Are you okay? Did you get hurt? What is this dress? It looks good on you. You look so pretty. No, I mean why am I wearing this? There was some water on the floor when you fell, so your clothes got all wet. You could die if you're wearing wet clothes on this cold winter. Don't Worry. My eyes was closed. And even with gloves on. Where are my clothes? In there. You look very pretty right now. It suits you very well. I knew this was gonna happen. Are you looking for this? Could you give that to me? It's not gonna work. I'll bring you these clothes later. I'll get going. What are you going to do if you get electrocuted again? But that's not gonna happen. I've cleaned up all the wet floor. Youngwoo noona, Are you going with barefoot? What did I say? I told you it's no use. The car broke down because of the electric shock earlier. Let's go to the office first. I called the tow truck. Okay. Oh, Wait. Put these on. Your feet are wet. When will the tow truck come? They say it will take time because it's Christmas Eve. But they say they'll be here in a minute. I'm not going to give my jacket to you. You look very pretty right now. But if I take off this jacket, it will cover that pretty form. So I'm not taking it off. Would you be okay? Yeah, I'm okay. That's a relief. If you asked me to take it off, I would have taken it off. You look very beautiful right now. We have to wait anyway, so make yourself at home. Please have some of this. Isn't someone supposed to come? No. Why? I usually eat while thinking there's someone in front of me. It makes me think I'm less lonely. Am I really weird? When it comes to Christmas, we need to eat cake, right? Hold on. We have a cake. Have a drink. It'll make you feel better. Here. Merry Christmas! Cheers! Noona. I'm sorry. I'll drink it later. I get it. I understand. What's the best thing about being with a guy like me on Christmas eve that only come once a year? By the way, what about these clothes and shoes? Those are my girlfriend's. Ah, your girlfriend's? My soon to be girlfriend's. I'm good at preparing. What if it doesn't fit her? That's not gonna happen. If it doesn't fit her, she's not my girlfriend. Excuse me, the tow truck should be- Lee Junho. Sorry? It's Junho. That's my name. Okay. Fuck. Noona. Can we take a picture to commemorate this day? That's a little bit.. Please. Think of it as a Christmas present. Okay? Please? Sure... Okay, look here. 1, 2, 3! Noona, your expression.. Please smile a little more. Here we go!1...2...3! What are you doing? I'm sorry, I didn't- But still, you can't do that. I didn't mean to do that. Hello? I'm calling from Yeouido Industrial Complex Building. Please call a taxi for me. 5 Minutes? Okay. It's too late, so I think I'll just take a taxi. Thank you for everything today. Are you mad at me? I was being ignorant so- I'm not mad, I'm just shocked... Right? That's a relief. The tow truck will be here soon. Let's just wait- I'm sorry. I have to go home now because my daughter is waiting... Enjoy your Christmas, Junho. Alright. Merry Christmas to you too. Yeoungwoo noona. If you don't mind, at least wear this and then you can go. You'll catch a cold. Thank you. I'll return it to you when I get to work. -Okay. -I'll get going. Why isn't it working? Youngwoo noona, you're still here? All the doors are locked. The entrance to the parking lot is locked too Is that so? Excuse me. Please open the door quickly. My taxi is waiting. I don't want to, Youngwoo noona. Junho, I have to get home now. Aren't u going a bit too far? You're too much. Are you mad at me? Do you hate having a meal with me? Now that's not the problem here. And also, we're not even that close enough to eat together. Then we can get to know each other from now on. Why are you doing this to me? You've seen it all. It's embarrassing. It's all because I like you. You can't do this if you like me. I'm doing this because I like you. If I don't like you, why would I be with you? Why are you doing this? If I hadn't been like this, would you have dealt with me? What's wrong with you? I'm older than you, I even have a daughter. It doesn't matter. Because I only focus on you. It matters to me. So please open the door. I said I don't want to. Where are you going? All the doors are locked. Get out of my way. I'll take care of myself about that. Step aside. I said get out of my way. Who are you to keep me from leaving? Do you think you'll be okay with this? Move! Get out of my way! What are you doing?! Let go of me! I said let go of me! Why are you doing this to me? You're being too excited. You're not going to let me go? Uncuff me! I said uncuff me! I'm doing this because I'm afraid you'll get hurt. If you keep moving around, you'll get bruises on your hands. Don't cry. Please open the door. Please open the door. Please, I'm begging you. Let me out of here. I have to get out of here because I have a daughter. I have to go home now. If you're worried because of Jaein, I'll go get her. What did you say? I want to meet Jaein too. The yellow bag looks very cute on her. No. You'll stay with her, right? Please, don't. You'll stay with her, right? No. Why the hell are you doing this to me? Sould I go get her? No, Don't! Alright. Okay. I'll do as you wish. Noona, don't cry. I just need you to stay with me for a minute. Instead, please enjoy yourself while staying with me. You can do that, right? Let's get out of here. Let's start the party. Where are we going? You can look forward to my gift this time. Youngwoo noona, do you like movies? I like melodramatic movies. A man who's willing to do anything to protect his woman. The story of a woman who misunderstood a man at first, but later found out his true feelings and fell in love with him. Where are we going? The male and female characters really love each other. I want to be the main character of that kind of movie. You do too, don't you? Are you ready? Where are we? Where are we going now? Junho. Junho. What are you doing? No! Junho what are you doing?! Don't do this! No! Please, don't do this. I'm begging you. Oh My God! What are you doing? Please stop it, Junho. Please. No! Don't do this! This is an event for you, but you can't interrupt this. Noona... I've been thinking a lot. 'What would be the best thing to do for you?' I hate it when I see you having a hard time. That's why I'm planning to get rid of everyone who tormented you. The only thing I've been watching all this time is these two people who bullied you. What the hell is wrong with you? I've seen it all. I know it. I know what this guy did to you. Look this way. Cheese! Damn it. When I said look at the camera, you should've done it. Let's smile. Okay? 1, 2, 3! Nice! Let's do better. Okay. 1, 2, 3! Nice! Noona, what should we do with them? Should we just kill them now? No. Don't kill them. I knew you'd say that. But if you commit a crime, you have to be punished. They didn't commit a crime. No, even if they did, I forgive them. So, please don't kill them. I'm begging you. Don't kill them. This isn't what I expected. Okay. Let's save one of them. Who should we save? You decide. Please save them both. If you don't make up your mind, they'll both die. If you don't want them both to be killed, you choose one person to save. No! Please save them both. I'm begging you. Please! Should I kill them both? I can't decide. I can't do that. Alright. In that case, I'll decide it. No! Why are you doing this? Junho! If I see you one more time, you'd better run. What are you doing? You don't wanna go? Was it okay? What's wrong? You're going to kill me too, aren't you? Why would I kill you? That guy was the one who commited a crime, not you. Maybe we shouldn't have gone to the party first. We almost missed our first Christmas Eve. Wait. Youngwoo noona. Where are you going? It's dangerous so don't go too far. Okay? Team leader Seo. Are you okay? Did you get hurt? -The thing is.. -What's wrong? All the exits are locked. What should we do? I'm so scared. It's okay. We can get out. Let's get out of here. Somebody help us. Team Leader Seo, is that the key? I'll open the door. No! Wait! What should we do? Oh My God... Can't you reach it? Help me with this. Let's do this together. I didn't do it. Wait. What are you doing? I asked for your help. Snap out of it. Team Leader Seo, are we going to die? You. Listen to me now. We'll never die. Okay? Help! Is anyone there? Help! Wait! -We are going to die. -Snap out of it! Wake up! Okay? We can hide here. But I don't think we two can get in here. Just stay here for now. I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere. Noona where are you? Where are you? Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Hello? May I help you? Please help me. Pardon? Could you say that again? I'm inside an elevator in Yeouido Industrial Complex Building... Are you trapped in an elevator? Yes. I was kidnapped. Kidnapped? by who? The security guard of the underground parking lot. And also, he killed a man. Please help me! Please! Hello? Hello? Noona. He deserved to die. I did it for you. Don't you think so, Youngwoo noona? What should I do to make you understand my feelings? Take your shoe. Don't- I'll never get out of here. It shouldn't be like this. Youngwoo noona, are you still not going to come out? You're gonna hold on until people come? There's nothing I can do about that, then. Wait. Team Leader Seo. Help me. I promised her I'd let her live. But since you won't come out... No. Just let her go. I'm begging you. Then you'll come out? What do you really want from me? I'm just asking you to have a meal with me. That's all. What do you want to do? Okay then. You can say goodbye to her. Wait. Okay. I'll come out. Okay, noona. I'll wait! Where is Minhee? I let her go. I've already told you. I keep all my promises to you. Uncuff me. You said you liked me, right? Who spends time with the person they liked tied up like this? Okay. But you have to enjoy the Christmas Eve. Okay? Can I also have my bag, please? Sure. Here you go. You know I have to go home early because of my daughter. So let's set a time. In the meantime, I'll be hanging out with you. Stop saying you want to leave, or else I'm gonna change my mind because I'm upset. -Ouch. -What's wrong? Did you get hurt? I have a lot of scars, too. So please be nice to me, too. And I'll be very happy. This is what happens when you don't wear these beautiful shoes. Junho. Son of a bitch. Minhee! Minhee! Minhee! Minhee! -Shit! Is he dead? -Maybe he just fainted. -Turn on the alarm to wake him up! -Where is she? He woke up. The crisis has passed. I'm trying to shoot a melodrama, but you're trying to shoot a horror film. Then let's shoot a horror film. [911, How may I help you?] I'm in Yeouido Industrial Complex Building. Please save me. I'm trapped here. [I can't hear you. Could you speak up, please?] Yeouido Industrial Complex Building... [Sorry? I didn't hear you well. Please say it again.] [Are you still there?] [Police Station] [Drunk stranger: who's there?] Hello?

Hello? -Help me! -Shut up! You startled me! Hello? The battery's dead. Please report to a police station for me. I'm being kidnapped- -Report? -Yes. -Report for what? -Ah, are you trapped in here? -Please help me! Then, hold on- -Please report to a police station. Please do it now. -Where's my phone? I left my phone at the bar. I Have to go get- There's a guy over there. Ask him to help you. Please don't go! Please! Don't go! Noona. Should I just kill you? I don't want to kill you. Fuck! You don't like me because I'm young? You don't like me because I'm a parking lot guard? -No. -Then, what's the problem? You know how I feel. Then shouldn't you like me, too? Please don't let me down. Because when I'm angry, I can't help myself. Help! [EXIT] What took you so long? We've been waiting for you to open the gate. I'm on a patrol. We're here because someone made a report call earlier, is everything alright? -Of course. -Right? It must be just another prank call. -Officer Park, let's go. -How can we just leave when we got a report call? The security guard says everything is okay. Don't you know that there are the most number of prank reports on a day like today? The solos don't like to be alone on a day like this so they make this kind of prank call. Let's just go. But we still have to check. There are a lot of murders going on. Are you going to take responsibility if something happens? Let's look around and then we can go. It's okay, right? -Then I'll ride with you and show you around. -Will you? Thanks, Junho. But why is the music so loud? Help! Over here! Help! [Urgent. An emergency has occured.] -Help! I'm in here! Is there anyone out there? This is 7-8. -The patrol team need to check the reported area. -Okay. We're on it. I'm turning the car around. Help! Over here! I'm in here! Help! I'm in here! I'm sorry to bother you. You understand why we're doing this, right? Of course. Thank you for your hard work. Hey! Wait! Hey! Wait! Don't go! Hey! Hey! Don't go! Wait! Don't go! Don't go! Wow. You're so unbelievable, Youngwoo noona. How did you get out of there? It's getting more and more interesting. Noona. I think you can't be my girlfriend. It'll hurt a little. Hang in there. You won't be able to see it, so don't worry. You'll get more hurt if you keep moving. Hold still. I'll make it quick. Hold still. You bastard, what the hell are you doing? huh? Ah! Damn it! I've got a lot of people disturbing me today. You should've just stayed at home. Why are you here? Are you crazy? He even killed a man Take this key and get out. -Stay back. -It's not the time to worry about others. I've been watching you for a while. Who the hell are you? Take the key and call the police! Hi, Team Leader Seo. What's wrong? It's me, Chief Choi. -Are you really Chief Choi? -Yes, it's me. -But I saw... -What? ah... Are you dissapointed because the dead man comes back to life? I'm terribly sad right now. Do you know? What? Is something weird? This? wait a minute. Keep your eyes on me. Isn't it looks so real? How was my acting? -I don't know what you're talking about. -Ah, you didn't know right? What should I say to make you understand? A fun game? I told you this Christmas was gonna be fun. -A game? So you're saying all of this is just a joke? -What? No, this is not a joke. -It's not a joke. -Please, just let me get out of here. I ran from there to stop you from getting out of here. Of course I can't let you do that. Oh My Gosh, you startled me. Youngwoo, where are you going? I have the key with me, you have to take it with you. Youngwoo, you still don't get it? You can't get out of here! Youngwoo! It's much better to be caught by me than by him! Youngwoo, where are you? Where is my baby? Youngwoo. Youngwoo? Youngwoo, you should've accepted my heart. Don't you agree? Well, maybe we could have had a more interesting story. Yeah. But the results are still the same. But- What if... If you really hate Junho that much, what do you think about me? Ah, so annoying. There she is. It's Chritmas. Play with me. Where are you going? What is this? I thought you were gone. You scared me. Stop playing! Give me the key. What? This key? Take it. Your Christmas gift. I said give me the key! Where is she? huh? Where did that bitch go? I'll kill that bitch! Give me that knife. Have you ever killed someone? Wait. What's wrong with you? Is it because of her? Wake up. You can't shoot a melodrama with her. Don't mess up my scenario. Okay. Let's make this simple. Let's kill that bitch and finish this game. I don't care about that. And also, do you think I'll let you live? Do you even know how to kill people? You son of a bitch. Why did you touch her? You think I did it on purpose? I did that to help you. And I have to make it look like it's a real melodrama or something. I've done you a favor but look at what you're doing to me now. Wait. Let's be human. It's not like I've never done this before. And also this spot is always empty. When people are busy, it shouldn't be a problem to park in the disabled parking space. Don't you think so? I parked my car in here because I'm busy. Now we can park all the cars in disabled parking areas. Can't we? Noona. Noona. Don't hide for too long. I'm not like him. But if you keep denying my feelings, I'll be so mad. If I'm angry, I can't control myself. Noona. You're going to stab me with that knife? Do it. Do it! So you really wanted to kill me. Fuck! You can't do this to me. Not after all of what I've done for you. I don't want to do this to you, but you'll end up like that bitch. Let's see each other's faces properly for the last time. The main character doesn't want a melodrama, so we'll do horror. It wouldn't be like this if you liked me back. Look how excited and nervous I am. It's my first time killing the person I like. Get out of my way! I said get out of my way! I said get out of my way! As expected, you're different. That's why I like you. But at least now is The End. We should end the movie. Don't you think so? Goodbye, noona! I'll make sure to send Jaein to you. So you won't be lonely. Crazy son of a bitch. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you! I'll never die. And also, You can't kill anyone anymore. Do you understand? Just because you said that, doesn't mean I can't kill people anymore. Cut! The End! -Wow! -Wow! That was so freaking cool! -She made it out alive. -What if she calls the police? Don't get too excited. Since we're done, now let's clean it out in order. Right. Let's start from the cell phone. -Chairman Jo, shouldn't we at least catch her now? -It's too late. She must've already called the police. [PAUSE TO READ] [I already got rid off of the phone.] [Is this real?] [That was so fucking cool] [Don't you think things went too far? 4 people died] [What are we going to do with the girl?] [We don't have the time to clean up] [Thankfully we can control it from the remote] [You guys believe the chairman right?] [I believe him. I think this movie worth a lot of money] They're all dead anyway, and she doesn't know anything. All she know is it was only between them. What about the Hard Disk there? I said don't worry. -Did you download it all? -Yes, Sir. We only need this one program. -We got at least 4 people died. It will be so hectic for a while. -That idiot even picked our side. - I think he really liked her. - I knew it when he said he wanted to do melodrama. At least the movie is going to be so good. -I feel sorry for Choi Chief. -Where did Junho find him? They looked good together. If you're done with the title, show me. [Underground Parking Lot] Remember the shocking murder last Christmas Eve at Yeouido Underground Parking Lot?
