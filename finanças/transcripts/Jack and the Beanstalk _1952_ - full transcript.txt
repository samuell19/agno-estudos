(crashing) Oh, it's you! I'm sorry Arthur. I thought it was the babysitter. - Just what do you have against babysitters? - Why nothing. - Nothing? - It's a psychological stumbling block. The juvenile mind resents the restraint of adult authority. - You ever have the feeling you're too old for your age? - Physically, I'm only eight. Mentally, the doctors refuse to believe it. Why do you bring my sister flowers? Because you want to marry her? - It's all part of the racket. Where is Eloise? - Putting on her lipstick so you can kiss it off. - Come on, young fellow, I'll put you to bed. Or your sister and I are gonna be late for dress rehearsal. - Why do I have to go to bed? Only children go to bed this early. - Arthur, I didn't hear you come in. - You should have. I made quite an entrance, thanks to junior. - Donald, didn't you promise mother and dad you'd be a good boy? - I am being good. It just happens that their standards are much higher than mine. - Where's his babysitter? - His sitter? Well, Don, go in and wash your teeth and go to bed. And don't wake your baby sister. - What's the matter? - No babysitter. - There are dozens of babysitters in the neighborhood. - Well, not for my dear brother. He's been declared us. - Have you tried the employment agencies? - They don't have babysitters. Well, it looks like my understudy will have to go on tonight. - Start calling every employment agency 'til you find one that's open. Get somebody, anybody. - Sounds like a bad idea, but I'll do it. - And I'll handle my pal Donald. (car honking) (tires screeching) (engine revving) (car banging) - That's pretty reckless driving. - I'll say it is. You ought to watch where you're going, big boy. - Ah. - What are you trying to do, get away? - Out of my way. Out of my way, shorty. (grunting) (car rumbling) I ought to run you in for this. - You're big enough to carry me in. - Officer, we're terribly sorry. - Well alright, but don't let this happen again. And get off my car! (smacking) - What are you gonna do with that? - Put it away. - Well keep it there. - Yes? Uh huh. I'd better hang up. We've been talking for 10 minutes. Here comes my heavy date for tonight. Bye. - Who were you calling a heavy date? - You. Can you wait outside for five minutes? What a way to get a ticket. - Well if I do, I can get it fixed. I have influence. - Don't do that! - Why don't you look where you're going? See you outside, baby. - What do you see in a tall, dark, handsome fella? - Plenty. - Girls never say that to me. - What do they say to you? - Shush, nothing exciting. (phone ringing) - Cosman Employment Agency. Yes I have been on the phone for quite a while. I'm sorry, we don't list babysitters. - Just a minute, lady. You are looking at the world's greatest babysitter. - That's right miss, sure. - Him? - He is the best. - Where do you fit in to this? - Oh I'm his agent. - Yes, he lets me keep 10% of everything I earn. - I'm sorry I took so long, but fortunately, a professional babysitter just came in. May I have your address, please? Thank you, he'll be right out. Goodbye. - Oh thank you miss. Gee, you're wonderful. I like girls like you. Eyes of blue, and five feet two. Timber! - Sorry to be late. - It's okay. Shall we go? - You mean you and I are going out together? - You see dink, I have a way with girls. Please. - Now listen! - Yes daddy. He's so big! - Come on, we've got babysitting. Get with it. (engine rumbling) (thudding) (thudding) Why, why are you so clumsy? - I'm excited. - Why? - This is my first job. Gee I hope he's a sweet child. I love children! - Come on. (doorbell ringing) - It's about time they got here. - Are you the-- - Babysitter? He sure is. - You're kinda big for a baby. - You're not for me. - Oh, rejected again. I guess it isn't my night. - Won't you come in? - Sure. - Surely. - Well, we'll be plenty comfortable here. - Well it's too late to get anyone else. Have you had much experience with babies? - Why yes sir, I've been a baby all my life. - Don't you worry about Jack. The kids just love him. He makes 'em feel so superior. - In which they are. - Sure. - Well they're both sound asleep, and I'm sure you won't hear a sound out of them all night. But if you need anything... - Oh no, Madame. I don't need a thing. I'm prepared for everything. - No one's prepared for Donald. - Well, good luck, and we'll be home after 11:00. - Oh, you're going out right now? Oh, costumes. Going to a masquerade ball? - No, a play. - A play, kids are gonna play. May I see you out the door? Excuse me, I'll help you. Oh miss, in case I want to see the children, just where are they? - Oh they're in the bedroom down the hall. - Thank you. - High class, huh? (baby crying) - Music to my ears. My first victim. Duty calls! See you, Mr. Dinkel! (baby crying) This calls for action. (thudding) Shush, quiet. You want to wake up your sweet little brother? Now what seems to be the trouble? (baby crying) Have a nice nap. This is my real business, I know kids. Goodnight. - Get me a glass of milk. - What'd you say? - I said get me a glass of milk. - This is unbelievable. This kid talks better than me. - You're not very bright. - I'm sorry, kid. What school did you go to? - The baby isn't talking, I am. - I know you're talking, but who? - I'm talking over here. - This kid ain't even moving her lips. This is a baby ventriloquist! - I'm talking over here. - I know it's you. I mean, I'm, your, ah. You? What's your name? - Donald. - Are you a good boy? - No, it's not my nature. I'm a problem child. - Get a load of the kid, he's a problem child. Just like me, I think. Would you like to have me read you a story before you fall asleep? - That's been tried, too. (thudding) (grunting) - Oh this kid, been tried too. Breath, out, you, I ought to, I ought to, I ought to... "Jack and the Beanstalk." That's my favorite novel! Donald, can I read this to you? - Well, I want to keep you happy. Let's hear how it goes. - Thank you, Donald. Once upon a time, that's pretty exciting, isn't it? Once upon a time, a whole village was tur-- A whole village was terr-- - Terrorized. - Yeah. Yeah, the whole village was terrorized by a ferr-- A furr-- - Ferocious. - Yeah. Donald, do me a favor. This is a very exciting book about the giant and everything. Will you read it to me, please? I can't get over the big words. - Only because I'm fascinated by you. Here, hold my club. - Yes, fascinated. - Once upon a time, a whole village was terrorized by a ferocious giant. - Yeah. - Who lived in a castle in the sky. In this village lived a simple peasant boy named Jack. And his widowed mother. They had come up on hard times because of the giant. One day, Jack was told to bring their only cow to the market and sell him for food. Jack, being very stupid-- (voice drowned out by music) - Hey! Wee! Ooh, ooh! (humming) (exciting music) Princess Eloise. (steady music) (cow mooing) Your Highness. - I wonder if I could have a glass of water. - Yes, your Highness. Hey Billy, can you imagine me getting water for the Princess? (sighing) (fabric tearing) Uh oh. (goat baaing) See anything, Billy? (baaing) Oh Princess, I would've brung you the water. - I'm a little tired of people waiting on me. It must be wonderful to be allowed to do everything you want to, whenever you want to. - Oh, you don't get around much, do you? - What do you mean? - You mean you haven't heard? There's no food in the village. The giant, he's taken everything. He's even taken your father's crown jewels, didn't he? - That's why I have to marry Prince Arthur. - Well, isn't it a love match? - I've never even seen him. But his people have money. Did you ever have to marry a man you've never seen? - They tell me I'm a boy. - So you are. And a very nice boy. - Thank you, your Highness. Why don't you run away? - Princesses can't do that. - Oh, but maybe he'll be young and handsome, and you'll fall madly in love with him. - That only happens in fairy tales. Thank you for the water. - Thank you, your Highness. And Princess, remember. Have courage, fear nothing when you're in the right! That's my motto! - Jack. - Yes, mother? - Jack, you must stop talking to yourself. - I wasn't talking to myself, mother. I was talking to the Princess Eloise. - Princesses don't talk to peasant boys. Oh Jack, when are you going to grow up and get some sense? - Does one go with the other? - Jack, I've come to a very important decision. - You're not gonna give me away. - No. If we're not to starve, I'll have to sell our last valuable possession. - No, you're not gonna sell the cow. - She has to go. - You can't sell Henry. - Jack, how many times have I told you, Henry isn't a proper name for a cow. - Alright, from now on, I'll call her Halbert. But you still can't sell Henry. - Take her to the market this morning, but be sure to get a good price. - Yes mother. You can depend on me. Whatever they bid, I'll bid higher. - Jack, you'll be selling, not buying. - There's a difference? - Fetch me a pale of water, and then be on your way. - Yes, mother. (gentle suspenseful music) Now look, Henry. This is the last time I'm gonna let you look. You look beautiful. You and I are gonna part very soon. You were the only thing I loved. Now this is the last look you're gonna get, Henry. Take a look. Don't you look pretty? Oh, parting is such sorrow. We gotta go, Henry. Uh oh. (trumpets blaring) - Whoa, boy. Tell me, young fellow, will this road take me to the royal palace? - No sir, but your horse will. Say, you're Prince Arthur. - So they tell me. - Oh boy, will the Princess be surprised. - Princess Eloise? - Mm-hmm, you should've heard what she said about you this morning. - No worse than I said about her. Any girl who will marry a man for his father's money-- (rumbling thunder) - Uh oh, the giant. It's the giant, Henry. But you're safe with me. I won't let him take you. See? What did I tell you, Henry? I protected you. Now look, Henry, I gotta go tell the Prince about the bad giant, stay here. Hey Prince, where did you go? Oh come on, this is no time to play games. Oh Prince. Oh Prince! Hey Prince, hey Prince! (dogs barking) Get off me! Help, help me! (dogs barking) (mooing) He's a rough one, Henry. Cut it out, no! (dogs barking) - But why don't you have any cloth? - My good woman, for cloth you need wool, and for wool you need sheep, and someone stole all our sheep. - Oh I don't believe that silly story about the giant. - Oh, there's a giant alright, Mrs. Mergatroyd, because I saw him. - You see a lot of things that other people don't. - Did you really see him Jack? - I saw his shadow. - How do you know it was the giant's shadow? - That's a very good question, goodbye. - Where are you taking that cow? - I'm gonna take my cow to Mr. Dinkelpuss the butcher. (people chattering) - What's all the excitement? - You have a whole cow. - And don't you try to deceive us! - You're not gonna hold this one for the black market. The idea of selling those less sirloin steaks for seven cents a pound. There ought to be a law. - Now ladies, ladies, ladies. I haven't seen a cow around here for months. But you bring somebody to me with such an animal, I'll reward him like he's never been rewarded in his life. I'll make him rich, richer beyond his dreams! I'll pour gold into his pocket. I'll pour gold so deep, that-- Wait a minute, not that scrawny animals. Huh, you're not trying to pawn him off to me as first grade beef? Why I wouldn't let my worst customer use him for stew. - Her. And I love Henry. - Well, everybody to their taste, but come inside, Jack, and I'll give you the best deal I can afford. - Come on, Henry. (cow mooing) - Imagine that. I mean, all beef, we haven't had any, and look at this cow. I'd like to get some of that. - I certainly would, too. - What you doing? Hey, what's the idea of that? - Well I don't want everyone to know how generous I am. - Oh, how much are you gonna give me for the cow? - What, you're asking money for that wonderful animal? I was gonna give you beans. - What do I want with beans? - What do you want with my magic beans? I should have my head examined. Trying to make you rich. Money you're asking for, eh? I'll give you money, worthless money. How much do you want? Any price at all, how much? - Now wait a minute, Mr. Dinkelpuss. I don't want that worthless money. Either I get the magic beans or I take Henry home. - Well, you strike a hard bargain, boy. - No beans, no cow. - Well I know when I'm licked. Come on out in the garden. I keep my beans hidden out there. Come on. - Magic beans. You gotta get up awfully early in the morning to put anything over on me. Come on, Henry. Let's go, Henry. Henry. - One, two, three, four. Now, they must be around here someplace. You've gotta keep 'em buried, you know. You can't let the village know where these magic beans are. They're priceless. There they are. My magic beans. Don't tell anybody that I gave them to you, will you? - Yes sir. - Shush, it's a secret. But I'll never realize, I'll never know how you ever talked me out of them. - Mr. Dinkelpuss. - What? - Can I say goodbye to Henry? - Well surely, go ahead. - Alone. - Alone? Right ahead. - I gotta say goodbye now. (melancholy music) Be a good boy for Mr. Dinkelpuss. Do you mind if I kiss you goodbye, Henry? You's such a good pal. - The Princess! - The giant has stolen the Princess. - Henry, you hear what they're yelling? The giant has kidnapped the Princess. (people chattering) Goodbye, Henry. (melancholy music) (rumbling thunder) (cow mooing) - Now don't worry. I've been robbed! - Mother! Mother. A terrible thing has happened. - Oh, somebody swindled you out of our cow. - Oh no, I made a nice deal for Henry. But the giant kidnapped the Princess, and is holding her for ransom. - Oh the poor girl. I'll gladly contribute the money you got for the cow. - Money. Only a fool would take worthless money for such a valuable animal. I got five magic beans. - Oh Jack, why is it whenever I send you on an errand, you always do the wrong thing? - One, two, three, four, five magic beans. Ain't I a smart boy for out-smarting the butcher? - You were indeed. Plant the beans, my boy. Maybe they'll grow something that we can eat. - Mother. - Plant the beans, Jack. - I'll plant the beans. I'll plant them. (humming) Oh, you're not ordinary beans, are you? Please, beans. Will you grow like magic beans? So I can prove to my mother and everybody else that I'm not addle-brained like they think I am? Or am I? Oh magic beans. One, two, three, four, five. Grow, please grow. (gentle music) - Jack, will you please go to bed? - Yes mother. Please grow for me, magic beans, please. (bright mystical music) (lively music) (suspenseful music) (gasping) Mother, mother! Mother! (upbeat music) Mother! - Jack, what do you want? - Will you please get my mother? - I am your mother. - Mom, mother, look! Look, the beanstalk! (people chattering) (horse whinnying) - Huge beanstalk! Look at it! It goes way up in the sky! - I tell you all. (people chattering) I grew this beanstalk last night. With five beans that I planted. Five magic beans. - Jack dear, please stop repeating that nonsense. - Mother, this isn't nonsense. This is the truth. - Hey, are those the beans that I gave you for that cow that disappeared? - You mean Henry ran away? - Yes, and I want my beans back. - Don't you dare disturb that beanstalk. It might lead up to the giant's castle. - So what? - So what? Maybe a brave boy will climb that beanstalk and kill the giant and save the Princess, and live happily ever after. - Oh no, Jack. The giant will kill you like he did your poor father. - Have no fear, mother. I'm gonna climb that beanstalk, and I'm gonna kill the giant, and avenge my father. And then I'm gonna save the Princess. And while I'm up there, I'll look for our little Nelly. - You mean this boy had a sister? You poor unfortunate woman. - Oh no, Nelly was our hen who laid the golden eggs. - A hen that lays a golden egg? - 14 carat. - Up there? - Oh sure! - Well, let me help you, my boy. - Goodbye, mother. - I'll go along with you. - Goodbye, mother. - That's a boy. Take your time now. There we go. - Goodbye mother. (people chattering) - Don't worry, Mrs. Strong. He won't be back. - You don't understand. He wasn't much. But he was all I had.

The only thing I do wish I knew why the master keeps a wench like you around. - He likes my cooking. And I don't want to hear another word out of you. - Oh cuckoo. Can you make an Irish stew? Can you boil a potato like my poor mother used to boil them? - I can put you back in the cupboard if you don't shut up. - I know you can tell 'em that you never put the Princess in her cell like he told you to. - You win this time. - Patrick always wins. Come back to Urden, my violin, my violin. Oh just in fine voice I am today. - I still can't believe that harp talks. - He talks too much. - How do I look? - Ready to be locked up. - Well do I have to be? - Orders, me dainty beauty, orders. - Unfortunately, he's right. - I meant to ask you, are you the giant's wife? - Heavens no, I'm his housekeeper. He stole me last year from another kingdom. - Well what will he do with me? - Release you for ransom money, perhaps. - And if there is no ransom money? - You'd make a lovely Sunday dinner. (gentle strumming) - Music in a dungeon like this? - Thank you for calling it music, whoever you may be. - Who is he? - A troubadour the giant picked up yesterday. - Who are you? - I'm just a girl from the village below. - What's your name? - Darlene. - Are you as pretty as your name? My guess is yes. (gently strumming) - That's a nice melody. Are there words to it? - Not yet, but there can be by tonight. What will you be doing? - What did you have in mind? - A rendezvous in the garden. I'll speak to the giant about it. - Fee fie foe fum. I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive or be he dead. I'll grind his bones to make my bread. - Mister, if I'm too heavy for you, I'd justly walk. - Me too. (laughing) (weeping) (banging on door) - Open the door! - Take me with you. (giant laughing) - Open the door! (banging) - Open the door! Open it! - Here's some extra help for the kitchen. - You're a little one, aren't you? - Well I grow on people. (sneezing) - Bless you, me boy, bless you. - Who said that? - What do you know, a talking harp. - You said that? - I said bless you. And I'm sorry now that I see your silly little face a bit closer. - Oh! - Thank you, master. 'Tis a sight for sore eyes, it is, yeah. - Thank you, Patrick. - Well, I'm off to hunt in the forest. - Will you want any supper? - Just a midnight snack. - Anyone we know? - Could be. (laughing) What's the matter with you? - Did you hear that? - Yeah, I hope it's not me. (weeping) - Then what's the matter with you? - You're standing on my foot! - Ah. - Come with me. I'll show you what you're supposed to do. - Yeah, you show me, and I'll show him. - Make the little fat one work 'til his back breaks. Oh I love the sound of cracking bones. - You're a bad harp, and you're gonna have a bad end. - Sticks and stones, sticks and stones! - Alright blabber mouth. Into the cupboard you go. - Don't you dare put me in that dark cupboard again! Don't you dare! A thousand curses on you.

Would you like a glass of milk before supper's ready? - Thanks. - Thank you miss. Or is it Mrs? - It's miss, why? - Well, when I look at you-- - Now now wait now now. You're too young to go out with girls. - Yeah, but this might age me fast. Here's to us. - No, leave that alone. - I don't want to lose any of it. - Well don't get hoggish. - To us! - To us! Why you sweep me off my feet. - I'd need a little help for that. Well, here. It's Henry's, she's here! - How do you know? - No other milk ever tasted this pleasant. Where is she? - There's plenty of time for that, but I have an idea how we can escape, if you're interested. - We're interested. - Not me. Not unless I can take along the Princess. - Does she mean that much to you? - Oh no, you jealous? You needn't be. I promised my mother that I would return home with the Princess. And after all, a boy's best mother is his friend. Huh, is that right? - No! (gasping) - Your song's finished. - My song? - Listen.

There's a young man in the next cell, and I don't want him to know who I am. - Why not? - All my life I've wanted someone to know me as me. Not as Princess Eloise. - You have but to command, your Highness. Here, eat this. That will make you good and strong so we can sail you over the wall. - Sail me over the wall? - Yes, we're gonna build catapults out in the garden. And the housekeeper, she thought of it. She's on our side. - Oh, you don't supposed she'd let us out tonight for a rendezvous in the garden? - Princess, I didn't think that you cared for me. - Not you. I meant the young man I told you about. - Oh. Well, if I approve. After all, I am one of your royal subjects. And I do so want to see our Princess go out with the right fellow. Goodbye, your Highness. (banging) Prince Arthur. I wondered what happened to you. - Hey, aren't you the young fellow with the cow? - I'm alone now. Here's your supper. - I guess the Princess was disappointed when I didn't show up at the wedding. - I never saw a girl cry so much in her life. What are you whispering for? - I don't want the girl in the other cell to know I'm a Prince. - You don't? - No. Look, you seem to have some influence around here. You don't suppose you could-- - Let you out tonight so you could have a rendezvous in the garden? - How did you know? - It's a secret. But first of all, I'll have to get you some other clothes, because the clothes you have on make you look too much like a Prince, Prince. Or, your Highness, excuse me. (banging) I'm sorry. (squealing) - What have you decided? - Well, his parents don't have the background of yours, but he's a wonderful fellow. And your loyal subject approves. - Thank you, Jack. - I just got through telling the housekeeper, and now I'm gonna tell you. - What's on your mind? - The Prince is not the Prince, and the Princess is not the Princess. - Then who are they? - Just a boy and girl in love.
