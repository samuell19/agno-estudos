They say she's buried under a tree. That her killer planted a sapling to mark the place where he buried her as a sign of his love and remorse. But that's just a story and no one really knows. Hello Louis. My name is Detective Cardenas. This is my partner, Detective Oslo. You know what this is about, Louis? Not really. Kaleem Roberts. What about him? He's dead. No shit. Where were you about 9:30 last night, Louis? My house. Watching porn. Why don't you just tell us what happened? In the porno? He's funny. You a comedian? Come on, Louis, this is serious. If you say so. Did Gabriella know Kaleem? Who? Your mother? She's dead. Oh. What happened to her? Car crash. Is she buried in Guatemala or here in the US? Here. Gabriella seems like a good woman. Yo, why you doing that? Doing what? You know, just you're talking like you know her. Take a look at something here. Kaleem. It took five bullets to take him down. He was really strong. Gunpowder all over his skin. Shooter got right next to Kaleem. So close they coulda hugged. Hey, how did you cut your knuckle? Mailman on your block saw you and Kaleem throwing punches yesterday. You guys got in a fight. No. Then how did you cut your hand? I was helping my tio. Fixing the car. What's your tio's name? Oscar. Oscar what? Suarez. Tell us about Donna. I dumped her last year. This is bullshit, Hank. It's a waste of time. Donna's on her way over. Everybody knows. She dumped you for Kaleem. Fuck you. I'm just saying, I mean, 10 people on the block said so, it's not a secret. Fuck that, man. That must've really hurt. Kaleem, your best friend. Donna, your girlfriend. Together. Man, they played you. Frank, come on. We don't need him. He deserves a chance. To what? To tell his story. He deserves shit. Frank. Listen, Donna's gonna be coming in a little while, mijo. The DA's gonna take over and you and me, we're done. This is our time together. There's not gonna be any other. It's just you and me, here and now. I know you're a good kid. I can see that. You were tight with Kaleem. He lived on my block. No, no, no, no, no, he was over to your house all the time when you were kids. That was before. Before what? Before. My mother died when I was just about your age. It changes everything. Hey, you think I'm stupid? My mother died when I was your age, what do you think I am, man? Her name was Lorita. You wanna hear something crazy? Sometimes, I feel her. It's like she's watching me, like she's... Are you thirsty? You ever feel like that, huh? Like Gabriella's around you? Sometimes. Maybe. Do it for her, Louis. Do what? Tell the truth. I am. Do you feel her here? No. She knows that you didn't mean to kill Kaleem. I didn't kill him. Look at me Louis. Look at me! Gabriella is here. She's watching us. You and me, right now. She saw you. You can lie to me but not to her. You didn't mean to kill Kaleem. He laughed. He laughed when I pulled a gun. And then what happened? He said "Quit frontin'. "You're not gonna pull the trigger." And then you shot him. No. Yes. - You shot him. - No! The gun shot itself, it wasn't me. I didn't mean to, the gun shot itself. Louis, where's the gun? I'm sorry, Kaleem. Fuck. My god. Where is it? Where's the gun? Laura Valdez Maldonado disappeared on July 23rd, 1979. Her apartment was the scene of apparent violence and was strewn liberally with blood. But her body was never found. In death, she was given the nickname, the Brown Dahlia, in morbid tribute to the greatest unsolved killing in Los Angeles history. The Black Dahlia, AKA Elizabeth Short. Short was killed in 1947, her body found cut in sections with surgical precision and completely drained of her blood. Laura's killing inverted Elizabeth's. All blood but no body. Holy shit. What? 74 murder confessions, that ties the LAPD record, Henry. You didn't know? Yeah, I knew. Thanks a lot, guys. Come on, let's go get some drinks for this Mexican bandito. Amen, let's get a drink. - Yeah. - Oh, no can do, hermanos, no. Oh, come on, Hank. Appreciate it, guys. Well, seriously, it was very nicely done, Cardenas. Well, Rollins, coming from you, that don't mean shit. Hey, hey, I'm a heart patient, alright? When you do break that record, we're all taking you out. Deal? James, you are on. Alright. Enjoy your hike. Hey. What's up? Wow. I mean, you really just sliced and diced that kid, didn't you? He's just a kid, he's an open book. Still. Remember that reporter I was telling you about, the one who wants to do a story about you? Yeah, and I told you that I wanted to think about it. Yes. Well, it turns out that she works at the bar that we're all gonna go to. Not tonight, okay? She really wants to talk to you. I think you should go. Last chance. - Next time, alright? - Alright, Jesus. 911, what's your emergency? There's someone in my house. What's your name? Olivia Renowitz. What's your address, Olivia? 734 Montague Street. Oh my god. Okay. What's he doing? He's walking around, he's talking, what the fuck? Do you know this person? - Frank. - Henry. What's up, Frank? Did you get a call about that stabbing? Yeah, yeah, I heard something about it. Bro, they find this guy two blocks away, covered in blood. He's all ours if we want. I'm going on my hike. Henry, think. You got a guilty, young punk covered in blood. We rope him in an hour, and bam, two confessions in one day. And not only that, my friend, you also break that record. You're really an asshole, you know that? So, that's a yes? Okay, yeah. Oh, there he is. I'll introduce you. Hey, hey. Hey. Henry, this is Regina Parker. This is the reporter I was telling you about. Of course, hi. Nice to meet you, Detective Cardenas. Henry, please. I asked her to come along, let her see what we really do. I really appreciate the opportunity. Yeah, well, it's not like on TV. Let's take a look. Oh, congratulations by the way. I told her you tied the confession thing. Yeah, well, he talks a lot. Yeah, he doesn't talk enough. Alright. Olivia Renowitz, age 33, was renting the house. Junior professor at Occidental College, expert on Sumerian civilizations, whatever that is. It's Mesopotamia before the Babylonians. Mesopo-what? Iraq. Oh, my brother-in-law was over there for two tours... What happened? We don't know yet. Something bad? Yeah. Oh. What's your name? Tracy DeLeon. Oh, my name is Henry Cardenas. How do you do? Very well, thank you. You live around here, Tracy? There, we just got home. Oh. Tell me, were your mom and dad here earlier? I don't have a dad but my mom was at my concert; I'm in the choir. Oh really? What song did you sing? We sang Somewhere Over the Rainbow. Oh, I love that song. Me too, wanna hear it? You know, I don't have any time right now but maybe later. Okay, later. Okay. Hey, would you do me a favor? Would you go back in the house with your mom now, please? Okay. Thanks. Come on, Tracy.

Hermano, when I say reporter, you say cocktail waitress. Come on, reporter. Reporter. Shut up, it's fine. Ah, I'm sorry that took so long. It's okay. - You alright? - Yeah. Hey, can Regina ride with you, you know, for the article? Why not? Thanks. - We'll see you there. - See you. Good night. Frank said you don't like reporters. Well, some of them have distorted things that I've said. Well, I'll quote you a lot. I like to let my subject tell their own story. That works. I started off in uniform patrol in Boyle Heights. Did that for four years. Before long, they moved me up to narcotics and I was promoted into Robbery-Homicide in 1993. And you had a heart attack two years ago? Yeah, I had a double bypass. How did that affect you? Hurt like hell. No, but no, I... I take a dozen pills a day. I finally quit smoking. And I hike five times a week. And your family? If you know I had a heart attack, then you know I had a divorce too. Touche. Don't be shy, just treat this thing like a, like an interrogation, okay? Oh god. Come on. Okay. What's the key to an interrogation? Rule one, keep 'em talking. Keep 'em talking. Oh yeah. Just, just keep words coming out of their mouth. It doesn't matter if it's babble, you know, the weather, football, their favorite film, doesn't matter, just keep 'em talking. So, keep 'em talking. Keep 'em talking. What's rule number two? Patience. You see, 'cause keep 'em talking means that you go off topic a lot, so patience is key. But it all pays off when you get that feeling from them. What feeling? Remorse. Oh my god. Olivia, where are you in the house? I'm in the bedroom, I'm under the bed. Alright, we're sending a car over, stay calm. Oh my god. Please just, please help me. - Hey. - Hi. Did you guys make some headway? It's so interesting what you guys do. Yeah, well, the ladies love Hank. What do we got on our boy here? Uh, no priors. Fingerprints brought in nothing in California. We got three fake IDs though in his wallet. Here, have a seat. He seems calm. Yeah, well, they start out that way. Until they meet the master. So, you are a killer writer, seriously. I mean, I'm very impressed. Shall we? Why don't you start out first, solo? And I'll hang here, we can kinda watch you. Excuse me. So, I really wanna hear more about your process. I'm Detective Cardenas. How long will I be here? Are you in a hurry? Well, as a matter of fact, I was on my way to... Yes? A meeting. Well, we'll go as quickly as we can. You've been read your rights, correct? Yeah, seriously Detective, I'm just curious why I'm here. You were caught about four blocks away from a stabbing murder and you were drenched in blood. Have we met? And inside your wallet, Kevin Polsworth, Marty McGuire, - Vince Marins. - Vincent Marins. Vincent Marins, is your real name? Correct. Seriously Detective, why am I here? To tell you the truth, angry young men covered with blood are a real reason for concern. You and I are here, so be it. No two way mirror, eh? In the movies, there's always a two way mirror. So, your real name is Vince Marins. Vincent, from the Latin. Vincere To conquer. I'll tell you what, Vincent. We ran all of these IDs and they all came up fake, even Vince Marins. Where'd you get your IDs? I know a guy. Did you know Olivia too? Olivia? Olivia Renowitz? Were you at the Roman Antiquities Show at The Getty? Olivia Renowitz. You knew her, didn't you? No. But I was hoping to meet her. You think I killed her, right? I know you did. You speak Spanish. The language of Cervantes is a favorite. How many languages do you speak? I don't remember. You don't remember? Well, some of them are dead languages like, oh, Aramaic? You speak Aramaic. It's quite seductive, eh? You're a Tower of Babel. I know, I know, it sounds pretentious but my entire life, I just absorb a language. Then I speak it and once I do, I can never forget it. Words stay in my skull like some intricate beehive, buzzing and buzzing and sometimes they rise up and swarm like locusts. Once in Syria, I saw a swarm of locusts. You feel them first. Static on the hair of your forearms. And then the sound, strange buzz that grows and grows. And you stare when you should run. The daylight fades and in two minutes, it's midnight. And suddenly it hits you. It stings. And you're swimming in the locusts and then drowning in them. And after? They're gone. You've traveled to Syria. Not recently, before. Before what? Before tonight. Listen, Vince. When the lab results come back on the blood on your clothes, the DA's gonna step in and you and me, we're done. This is our time together. A moment in infinity. I want them back, by the way. - Want what back? - My clothes. And please, don't wash the blood off, I want them as they are. Why is that? As souvenirs. Usually keep souvenirs, Vince? No, but Caesar did. The daggers at the show were inaccurate, FYI. Daggers? At the Roman Antiquities Show. The ones they used to kill poor Julius, those were actually carved from elephant tusks. Those pompous politicians loved ivory. The ones at The Getty were actually made of iron. No, I did not go to the Roman Antiquities Show at The Getty. But I did think about going. It was excellent, Detective. They did a solid job of recreating Caesar's day to day life. It looked fascinating. It was a good time. It's too bad you missed it. You see how I answered your question right now? I'm asking you to reciprocate. I'd like to, I would, but it's just that things get so, I don't know. - Complicated? - Complicated. Life is more than complicated, Vince. It's, it's confusing. We can all feel lost, can't we? And alone. I do. Vince, let's try to, to walk you back. How? By telling me, how you ended up in that house tonight, covered with some woman's blood. Where do I start? How about the beginning? Can I call you Henry? Of course. Remember I told you I speak a few languages earlier? It's from lack of sleep. You have insomnia? God, yes, my mind churns all the time, who could sleep? We can get you some help for that after this is all over. Swear to you. How much sleep do you get on average? I have never slept. You'd die if you never slept. You'd die. Not me. You're immune to the laws of physics? Physics, no. Human biology. How does that work? You wouldn't believe me. Try me. I'm... I'm not human. Well, if you're not human then, what are you? A fallen angel. - You think I'm crazy. - No. You think I'm playing crazy. I hear your mind, Detective, playing word association. You hear fallen angel and you think what? Satan, right? Tell the truth. Well, Satan was a fallen angel. I knew it! His name is Lucifer. Meaning, bearer of light. The Morning Star is something he was also called. Yes. That's right. He's my older brother. Right. They call me Lucifer's kid brother. I'll be back in a minute. I tried to warn you. - Henry. - Hm? You've been in a swarm of locusts, haven't you? I have a good imagination. Of course. Can you get out of the house? Oh god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, he sees me, he sees me, he's coming. The car's coming, stay calm Olivia, - stay with me, okay? - Hank, what was that guy, remember like two months ago, there was that guy with the two shotguns and he was, I mean, oh, did you just see that? Did you just see the hair thing? What a pretentious fuck. Roman Antiquities at The Getty? Did anyone else pick up the ehs that he had in his speech? The eh? Yeah, when I was in Toronto four years ago. Hey, look at this. It's filming him? - Look at this. - See that circle there? - Mm-hmm. - It's a lens. I'm a techno doofus. You are. So, we got three different IDs, three different states. I mean, we don't know where this guy's from. Should I try the FBI? Yeah, but don't hold your breath. You might wanna give the RCMP a call, see if any of the Mounties have insomnia. Canadian, yeah. Don't go anywhere. Sure. So what do you think of him? Detective Oslo? No, the suspect. Vince. He's vain. Actually, he's posing. He knows we're watching him. So, why does a good looking young man from Canada travel all the way to Los Angeles? He came to Hollywood. This guy's an actor. And you have a detective lurking inside you. Come on. ♪ Outside the club saw you standing in line ♪ In 1979, Laura was a young punk rocker on the cusp of crossing over. Her underground following was growing and no longer staying underground. Laura's star was rising. She told people she signed a contract with Capital Records based on some new songs she'd written. Laura was a talented songwriter as well as performer and people around her sensed looming greatness. The police classified the killing as unsolved. A cold case. ♪ Standing in line ♪ I need a favor. I'm working that stabbing murder out of Echo Park. You'll have it by end of day tomorrow. Look, I've got a live one here, Loretta. You taking your pills? Oh yeah, yeah, hell yeah, dozens of 'em. It was so scary that day. You know what, I don't remember. No fucking shit, asshole, you were dead. I called 911. Is that a yes? I'll call you. Thanks a lot, hon. Does the water taste different in Canada? You are Canadian, aren't you? What gave it away? I don't know, eh. I still do that? Tell me, is that an issue at auditions? Because you are an actor, right? Well done. Thank you. Well done. Do you have an arrest record up north? I'm getting it expunged. You ever kill anybody up in Canada? You got a nice voice. Vince, come on now. Round, warm, bit of bass underneath. Some very practiced modulations. It's a friend of yours in a situation like this, I bet. Did you know Charles Manson wanted to be a rock star? In the 60s, he and Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys were friends. Wilson let him stay in his big, fancy house. He encouraged Charlie to write songs and even recorded one of them. Wilson changed the lyrics and Manson was furious. You like Charles Manson? Last week, I was up for an episode of that New York police show, Criminal Intentions. I read for the role of the Nice Guy Killer. It was the title of the episode, The Nice Guy Killer. And in it, I was crazy but calm and cool, you know? Yeah, so how'd it go? I fuckin' killed it! I was crazy good. Very De Niro, the guy said. I scared them. So what happened? Fucking casting directors! You didn't get the part Again, fucking idiots. And that really pissed you off. Exquisitely. Is that why you killed Olivia? I'm sorry, Olivia, who's that? Vince, really? And scene. Scene? I was acting. I didn't get any auditions last week. You were lying? Improvising. I made it up. There's no improvising in here. We say improv and you're doing one right now. Oh really, how? Where you pretend to be the wise, calm detective, I pretend to be the unstable but possibly brilliant murder suspect, and we run with it. So, you're an actor and a fallen angel. Well, these days you have to do everything. Act, sing, write your own material. The skateboard tours help. Skateboard tours? My skateboard tours. Hey, hey, hey. You are in for a treat. Charlie Manson's still the most popular but I prefer some of the more niche tours like the Black Dahlia. The layers around her death, beyond intriguing. It's all on my website. I just put up a new skateboard tour on Monday. The death of Dorothy Stratten, Star 80, remember her? Yeah, yeah, vaguely. When they found her and her ex-husband's bodies, they were covered completely in a pile of ants. And I've got some previously unseen police photos of those bodies, exclusive. You said you have a website? Okay. You ever done any acting, Detective? No. You've got presence. Daytime, Hollywood Boulevard. I never sleep so day or night, this is where I come. Hollywood! Hollywood. Here we are, folks, in the world famous Hollywood, right next to the star of Groucho Marx. You know what Groucho wanted on his tombstone? Excuse me, but I can't stand up. He loved a good joke. You know, I'm Vince, your host of Hollywood Skateboard Tours. We're gonna explore some amazing things today. The star of Natalie Wood. Follow me. Because I told you, I'm working. I'm working. Okay, I said okay. Goodbye. What's up? I got a situation at home. You know the couple's counseling thing that's been... - You know? - Mm-hmm. I gotta go. I'll deal with her. Okay, thanks. She's harmless. Yeah, right. - Small newspaper. - Right. Bunch of dipshit hipsters. Right. You needn't be concerned. Oh, she needs a ride back to her car. I mean, I've heard it all before. Go on. Satan. The devil. Evil. Hitler. You name it, I've got a thick, thick skin. I call him by his name, Lucifer. Bearer of light. And what never gets told nowadays about Lucifer was that the most amazing thing about him was his voice. I mean, that boy could sing. You cannot imagine a voice like his. Your hearing cannot reach the range. Subtlety, the power. When Lucifer sang, the universe would just stop expanding and listen. And sometimes God himself was moved to tears by his singing. I know you're all thinking, what happened up there, right? Right? One day, Lucifer sang and everything in creation stopped as it did when he sang. God beamed happily. But somehow, Lucifer outdid himself, I mean, it was in fact, perfection. And you know what? A little creature was created out of his singing. A little wide-eyed creature, like a kinda cosmic pet dog. And it ran up to Lucifer and it jumped on him. You see, that's when the trouble started. You see, creating things was really God's line of work up until then. But, bam, there was this little fella and he came out of my brother's singing. It was a problem. But God made the creature disappear. I was shocked, to be honest. My brother, who had been very loyal up until then, was furious. Things got pretty fucking hot up there, as you can imagine. Friendships were tested and the next part of the story, you know. He got kicked out of heaven. And it happened, it happened fast, I... I didn't even get a goodbye. He was just over the edge and falling. And he sang as he fell, mocking God with that voice of his. I stood there looking over. I loved God. He was everything. But really almost everything, I also loved my brother. So, I jumped after him. If you've ever skydived, you'd get an inkling, the tiniest of inklings of that, that plummet. That descent. But I hit something hard, very hard. It was here, this planet Earth, while my brother fell further and further into Hell and I never saw him face to face again. I've been here ever since and it's been a fucking slog, let me tell you. You wanna eat Greek tonight? I've been through Greek civilization. Roman as mentioned. Chinese, Assyrian, all looking for my brother. It wasn't until Babylon that he finally got word to me. I was in a pickle. I wasn't good enough for heaven and I, I wasn't evil enough for hell. He said I'd have to take a test. He set a date and named a place and if I met him at that exact time and place and was able to murder someone, I could join him. And if I failed, I'd get another date, another location, a few centuries later. I failed on four continents. My last test was in the late 1700s, murdering this little half-Sioux, half-white child in what we now call North Dakota. Such a cute child. My next meeting is coming up very soon. Tell people my brother isn't all bad. And God isn't all good. It's a bit more complicated than that, okay? I love my brother and I'd follow him into Hell. And folks, if you could just hear him sing, you'd understand. Fucking actors. Not your favorite group? He reminds me of someone. An ex. Ah. Detective Oslo. Hm? He's married, right? Yeah. Living up to the stereotype. What's that? Sleazy detective. Oh, wow. So, what's my stereotype? Work junky, Zen. Zen Master homicide detective. - Zen Master, huh? - Yeah. Fooled you. No, you think before you act. Everything's deliberate. You don't like me asking questions. You like to do the asking. What's your stereotype? Cheesy Midwestern girl, stars in her eyes. Fails as a singer in LA. Falls back to the hobby of millions, writing. You know, I used to sing. Really? Like in a band? I played electric guitar and everything. What kind of stuff? Crap. Oh. When was the last time you sang? Oh, um. At my cousin's wedding. One too many Chardonnays. And what was the song? Danny Boy. Her side's Irish. ♪ Oh, Danny boy, ♪ ♪ The pipes, the pipes are calling ♪ ♪ From glen to glen, and down the mountain side ♪ ♪ The summer's gone, ♪ ♪ And all the flowers are dying ♪ ♪ Tis you, tis you ♪ ♪ Must go and I must bide ♪ You got pipes. Stay calm, are you hidden? Are you safe? Oh god, oh god, he sees he sees me, he's coming. Can you get to another room? No, get out, please! Please leave me alone. Olivia, get out. Get out of the house. Oh my, oh my god, he's got a knife. Olivia, fight if you can, fight. No, no, please no, please, please! Car 76, you've got an apparent stabbing in progress at 746 Montague. Hey, you got a cigarette? Let me get one, please, please, please. Thank you man. Thank you, thank you, thank you. How do you know so much about Hollywood? I've been here since the beginning, since the inception. You look very young though. I know, but I'm an old soul, man. I'm an old soul, I've been around. You know. You were born and raised here? I was not born here but yes, I was raised here. I was born somewhere very far away, so. But yes, I was raised here. In Hollywood, in this land, in the culture we live in. What do you think about it? How do you think it's going? - Alright. - It's alright, right? There's a lot of stuff about Hollywood that people don't know yet. People don't know that's why I'm here to tell the truth, you know? It's a cold place. It's a terrible, terrible, frightening cold place and it's a cold world we live in. Sometimes I feel like I'm getting a little frosty myself. This website, if I could just... You wanna use my laptop? You don't mind? Take it. Well, that would help. You've been gone a while, Detective. I was looking at your site. You watched my one man show. I did. You're very talented. You're too kind. Of course, it's just ammo for the prosecution. But the press is gonna love it. I hadn't considered. Damn fly. You've got an opportunity here, Vince. Did I hear singing earlier? I thought I heard Danny Boy. I could've sworn. You ever listen to the words of Danny Boy, I mean really listen? Morbid. For if you come when all the leaves are fallen and I am dead, for dead I well may be, then you will come to the place where I am lying and you will kneel and say an Ave there for me. Imagine the singer stretched out in his grave, dead, talking to the living. It's usually the other way around, let me tell you. Stop with the noise, Vince. It's not me, it's that damn fly. Knock it off! Tell me what happened. Tonight, with Olivia. Stop the game. Don't you see it? Vince. Corpses and flies are just fucking. Shakespeare said that. I told him it would make a great sonnet. Gotcha. Should I kill him? Your hand is empty. You heard the buzzing. - You through your voice. - You wanna make a bet? You woulda won. You just can't stop, can you? Stop what? Performing. Improv-ing. We don't improv here. We. You did it, Vince. You were drenched in blood, admit it. I knew her address. Alright. That's a start. So, why did you know her address? My meeting with my brother. Your test. Exactly. He gave you her address? A time and a date. You were gonna go to her house tonight? Let's do it as an improv, Henry. No, no, Vince, we're making progress now. I'll tell you everything but as an improv. Please don't. Where the fuck is that car to Montague Street? I have a victim being stabbed right now. Stop, stop! Oh my god, oh my god, there's so much blood. There's so much blood. How in the hell did he hear us? I don't know. Tell me something. Why do actors do improv? I paid $500 for an improv workshop with my ex's acting guru, Leland Saunders. He was very intense about improvisation. He said it was foundational to his acting technique. And? And. I was acting in this improv with my ex, Adam, in front of the class. He told me something true it just, it just kinda came out. He was sleeping with our neighbor. Something I suspected. Why did he do that? Because he's an actor and he fucking got caught in the moment. You know, everyone tells him he's the next De Niro, that's what they teach them. I guess he just ran out of shit to make up and blurted out the truth. Is it like musical improvisation? In a sense, it taps inside. Will you tell me about Olivia? I need to hear everything. That's what a confession is. No holding back. I understand. Okay. How do we begin? Who am I? You are a fallen angel. Lucifer's kid brother. Let's go somewhere, in our minds. I mean a mental voyage. Okay, where? Relax. Inhale. Hold it for seven and feel gravity pulling you down into the chair. Keep breathing, relaxing, okay? Okay. Remember when you were a kid? Well... Relax. A boy with a vivid imagination, right, Enrique? Maybe. You used to dream you could fly? Sometimes. That imagination is now turned officially on. Okay. What if this were an elevator? This what? This room. It's an elevator. It's a little big for an elevator, isn't it? Not really, just relax. But imagine it, there's a strong, steel cable overhead and the room we're in is attached to it. Feel the weight. Feel the steel cable holding that weight. I don't know. Relax. Now, imagine it goes down. That's it. Easy. Gravity pulling us down. Feel it descending. I kinda feel it. You're doing good. Damn, I can feel it. Two floors. Three floors. Four. Down to where? Five. Six floors. Seven. Eight. Nine. Down to where? Eyes closed, senor, we're going to that confession. Confession, okay. A bit faster now, feel it? 10 floors. 15. 16. 18. We've gone down a half a mile. Okay, yeah, I get it. 22. Isn't that enough? 23, relax. Henry, the cable has us. Okay, okay enough. One mile. Stop. Easy, buddy. Okay, okay, that's it. Two miles. I, really, stop. Three. Seriously, seriously, I can't! Stop. Stop! Stop! Okay. Very funny. Okay. Vince, sit. Shh. Sit down. Sit. It's me! Sit down, Vince. I need you to be quiet. You can't. You can't. Come here. - No. - Come open this door. Open it yourself. I can't. Why not? Stop playing dumb. Where are we? Hell. Answer the phone, Henry. Loretta? Enrique. I got some weird news. What's that? The blood on his clothes, it's not from your victim. Not even close. What? The blood on the shirt you gave me is placental blood. It's from a human birth. Placental. I told you. Listen to the 911 call. I did. Which 911 call? 911, what's your emergency? Please, it's happening early. I was just doing my laundry. And my water broke. I can't understand you. Please speak slowly. I said I'm pregnant! What's your name, please? Stephanie. Galliard. Okay, hang on, Stephanie. What's your address? Hey, are you okay? I'm just trying to help. Hello? Who's this? My name it Vince, I was riding past I heard a women screaming. This woman is going into labor. Do you have someone coming because I've got a meeting and I can't stay. Okay, Vince, nice to meet you. Stay right where you are. We have an ambulance on the way. Goddammit! It's alright, I, what's your name? - Stephanie. - Stephanie, - just breathe, okay? - Okay. That's it. Okay. Excellent, you guys are doing great. Breathe. Okay, yeah. That's good, good, just keep breathing. Look at me! Look at me. Open the door. Push it open! Do it! Open the door! You tricked me. You've always been just tricking me. Your rendezvous? Every fucking couple of centuries. I jumped after you. I love you so much. Hey. Make it stop. I... I wanna go back up. The elevator's too heavy. We'd need to lighten the load. How do we do that? How do we do that? Was it under a tree like they say? What? It was rumored, Laura was buried under a tree. Sit. Please. Everyone is listening. I don't understand. We came here for a confession. Yours. You motherfucking little piece of shit, who the fuck... Sit down! Sit down. Talk to me about Laura. I can wait here forever, Henry. What about her? Where'd you meet? A party. She didn't look like anybody else. She was older than you. I was 16. She said she was 22 but no one knew for sure. What happened after that night? You formed a band, right? You, a couple of guys. Laura was the singer, no? Yeah. Tell me about the band. It was wild. She was wild. The band wasn't very good. No. But Laura was. Can we go now? Laura was good, right? The crowd, they liked her. - Yeah. - But not you. Not you. Not me. She kept you on a string, didn't she? I'm tired. Didn't she, because she knew that you had one unique talent. Not on stage, not with her, but writing songs. She'd go out and sing with other bands, right? Suddenly, bam, Laura got a record contract for a pop song, a pretty, sugary pop song about love. And what's the kicker, kid? The kicker is, you wrote that song. You wrote that song, that sweet, sappy teenaged romantic love song. You fucking wrote it, not her, right? - Yes. - For her? - You wrote it for her? - Yes. Because you were in love with her? Who wasn't? And Laura just took it. Then one night, she told you to get lost, didn't she? Get the fuck lost, right? Yeah. The night Laura died, she went to a club in West Hollywood. You followed her there, right? Yeah. Punk club? No. College kids. White kids. And she sang the song? The song you wrote for her? You followed her after the show? They went to his car. They had sex. You must have felt jealous, betrayed. I felt like I was outside myself. Like I... Like I was watching myself, like I was somebody else. Then? Then I followed her home to East LA. I... I broke in, I... You what? You found a knife. My tio had a farm up in the north, up near Ukiah. He used to raise pigs there. Sometimes he would slaughter one for food and he showed me how. And then afterwards, it was my job to, to bury the guts. Deep, so that the wild animals wouldn't get 'em. You cut her up. I, uh, I took a shower. And I, I knelt down there in the blood and the water. I wanted to be forgiven. And so I, right there, I talked to God. I told him that I wanted to make a deal with him. God makes deals like that? There was this, I could hear this cop show playing on the TV like down the alley through a window. It was cops and they were, they were chasing the bad guys with sirens. And I had an idea and I said to God, I said, if you just let me, let me get away, I, I'll become a cop and I'll get justice for all those people that were killed and I will never, never kill anybody again. And I offered that up to God. To atone? To atone. God took your deal. I've solved so many murders. So many. So, you stepped out of the shower? I put Laura into a, some black plastic bags. I took her out and I buried her. Deep. Was that so hard? Solve Olivia's murder. Close this case, you can do that. How? He'll help you. Go to her house, there are clues. But if I can't... Do this and you're done. - Done? - Clean. Atoned. Really? But quickly, it has to be now. Before the sun rises. Then, take us up. They're holding us down. - Why? - They like you. We need help.
