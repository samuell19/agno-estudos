Only two little gardens? You there isn't some other man then you aren't jealous. Not at all, darling. Last night, a gentleman bought a for five Franks and a minute later he came back and looked at me in the strangest way. Then he dropped 100 frank note on my tray. Eugenie. Are you trying to make me believe a man gave you all that money for a few Guineas? You've been out with him? Yeah, you don't either. Leah. I usually eat. Jealousy is a terrible thing. I like you to be jealous. I had to be ashamed of myself. Will you forgive me? Never. You seen it? I sit down old man have a bit. I told you to keep away from my daughter. Please come with me.

I'm gonna stay right here until in front of the upper at 11, a glass of Sharif and then row eight and hurry. I have to get straight. I have no one else in the world. I haven't seen you for days. Come home tonight, won't you? I will. I promise. I'll see you at home comedian. Yes, there she is. No of the I think. Yeah, on the alarm, Mr Duran, I took the liberty of waiting for you. Who are you? What do you want here? I've come here to find out about a girl you claim is your daughter feel is my daughter don't try lying to me. I know your record. I know your record. Where did you find this girl? She couldn't even walk when I got her. I brought her up. I couldn't love my own flesh and blood more. But what is it to you? Who is you genie? We see free a war orphan from Moscow. We can prove that only my poor friend George. He was an officer and put the child in my arms. He was murdered a few days ago. Only Downton and yourself. Yes. The light hurts my eyes. You don't mind? Wow. What time is Eugenie getting? She isn't here. She hasn't been home at all. Not tonight. It's funny what family I regret madam Danton to have had to trouble you at this time. But the identification of Doan as a friend of your husband's was of extreme importance. I understand. Thank you. Crime of passion is never a mystery. Leon Ronald's head is practically in the guillotine now, a natural conclusion. But I don't agree. Have you noticed the overdevelopment of the left hand? A left handed man doesn't dip his finger in blood and right with his right hand. Yeah. Careful. The windpipe is completely severed. Death was instantaneous. Someone wanted to kill two birds with one stone. Whoever murdered Anton Dove wanted to get rid of Leon Reynold. However, that's only a theory. Bring Reynolds in here. Wait a minute, a couple of cops. What is it? What is that? You'll find out soon enough, Reynold. I want to warn you that anything you may say will be used against you. I understand all that. But suppose we get to the point you're accused of the murder of Anton Doran, Doran. Where's Eugenie? Her disappearance makes it look bad for her too. Don't be absurd. Absurd. Why that girl wouldn't harm a fly. Why she's a saint? A saint is a sweetheart. I'll finish it for you. The saint is a sweetheart of a thief but not a murderer. Take him to Sante Prison and hold him until further orders. I'm not lying. I didn't do it just a minute. Suppose we give you a chance to prove your innocence as a thief. You have access to die is not exactly hospitable to the police. I'm not a stupid. I know I'm merely asking you to clear yourself if you're innocent and also your sweetheart. Well, it's a pleasure under the circumstances. You may go. When will I have the honor of meeting my coworkers again? You'll be surprised before you leave. I'd like to ask you one thing, why does a fellow like you go in for Thievery? Well, my father's body is part of the fortifications of Verone. My brother's body is lie at the mine. I have a few scratches myself. The world owes me a living the world but not France, meaning precisely. I'm very patriotic. I never love Frenchmen cheekbone. Classification A one R I'll find type chin 11 4 A Arian type I, right? Classification R 10 knows aquiline nordic 17, 8 lip, lower Slavic type 15 A but there are no pictures of Eugenie. How did you? This is a spoken portrait in a case where no photograph exists. We make one up from carefully checked descriptions. A girl. That's all the day. Come on. I want you to criticize it. Not be quite a bit like her. Well, that's fine. Wait for me in my office. I want you to note these features carefully. Find Eugenie do. She's the key to the Doan murder. Transmit spoke important to all undercover operatives, check all hospitals, institutions, morgues and borders. You'll be supplied with a facsimile on your way out. That'll do. Well, how's everything going? Oh, everything's practically done except for finding the murderer. Rees Princess Anastasia, open your eyes. It's all coming back to you. It's all coming back to you. Your memory today is much clearer than it was yesterday. Remember the day your father and mother were killed, the guards didn't even let you dress they ordered due to the seller. Remember princess who was there? My father. Well, my mother, well, my sister, well, and they draw all of you into a corner. You can see them raising their guns firing. Your father went down first. Then your mother. Please don't make me say it again. Your eldest sister fell over you. What did you see? Rest our princess. I believe her to be the lawful claimant to the throne of Russia. She has all the facial characteristics of Romanov. She knows secrets which only a member of the royal family could know found the missing daughter of the late Sir. Away Rosy. You don't believe princess is stay. Yeah. Oh yeah, I understand. There's another claimant in Berlin. Yes. But the Minister of Foreign Affairs is getting anxious about this one. This sort of thing is a to become political and financial. It isn't such a bad business being the Prince of Anastasia. Look at this. There is a lot of money involved and here's another little nest egg in London B 12 and K 31. Work on the anesthesia case. A 16 reports, no progress on the Eugenie Dorene case. A 21 reports. Leon Reynolds sincerely cooperating with police to find girl and wants instructions whether to arrest said Reynold while hardly cooperating with the police. Reynold has been collecting other people's jewelry. We'll deal with that later on. Well, the Schelberg bank case has been solved. So praise confessed. Here's something interesting. The court has been petitioned to appoint a guardian for Princess Anastasia General Molo guardian for the princess and a little over a million pounds in the London Bank. You don't think by any chance that a million pounds might be of interest to general molo come in wars. Confidential dossier contains this information concerning general molo extremely magnetic personality lives, extravagantly source of wealth. Unknown mother Manchu, princess, father Russian nobleman, trace of insanity on father's side, incidentally a charming fellow. This molo Paris gowns won't change that street gon to a royal princess. I have royal blood. I shouldn't put it on the stage. Not that flower girl. You are becoming tired. I've studied hundreds of faces and I found only one who is a perfect hypnotic subject and who also looks like a Romanov. But that girl can't stand the strain. Why she'll lose her mind. Well, if she does, then her guardian will rule Russia as. But you must realize too many people know her. Not as many as you think. If you have died, identification is going to be difficult. The way your space is passed in the corpse can't be identified, but there's very little doubt that it's Lonzo. Oh, by the way, I have Reynold outside. He knew the band too. Here's a little souvenir of their acquaintance. Chinese rare ancient Jade Renault seems to be quite a collector. Oh, there's no doubt about that K 31 reporting. K 31 reports she tried to get in Molo chateau, but the place was so heavily guarded. It was impossible. She caught a glimpse of the princess whose profile cheekbone and chin line resemble the classifications of Eugenie doin. I'd like to know what's going on in that chateau. I don't suppose we have any right to go in that place. On the other hand, a burglar has, shall we say poetic license come in? Won't you sit down Reynold? How would you like to, you forget, I never up Frenchman. It's just a matter of form. How would you like to exercise those rare talents of yours poetically at your service? We want to find out what's going on in a certain chateau at this address, in particular. We want you to look for a girl. You may find that she bears a slight resemblance to someone very dear to you. You mean Eugenie? I must warn you that the place is heavily guarded. Pardon me? I wouldn't advise you are trying to enter before midnight. I won't insult your intelligence by suggesting how to enter a house. Good afternoon. Come here. Yes, you'll lose up the valley princes, Princess Anastasia, my uncle Maxim, Uncle Maxim, Uncle Maxine, uncle Maxine, his imperial highness, the Grand Duke Maxim his excellency. The Count the Moet, your imperial heights. General Mola allow me to present count to Marseille. Delighted. I am honored. I shall inform the princess of your arrival. Your highness, a royal highness, the princess Anastasia. Yes, I go. Maxine were a mere child when I went off to the war and you still remember me. Yeah, older and you look tired. Ok, first your father, your mother and then your sister and soldiers. And what happened? Then please don't make me see that terrible thing again. You understand my dear child, why I oppress you with personal questions? Are these the flowers you want? What you come here here. Leave it off the ballet. God rents Princess Anastasia. Yeah, your highness come with me. Our highness is nervous. I am yet your highness must acknowledge that she has all the features of her. Romanov General Mola. That girl is not the Princess Anastasia. She's clearly a mental case. I should advise you to discontinue this idea or I shall be forced to notify the proper authorities. I respect your opinion and admire your judgment, your highness, but my faith in her is not shaken. I shall have experts test our mind. The moment I met General Mullah, I had to present him of danger was no, probably. Yeah. And the girl on the bed, well, I don't know whether she was asleep or dead. You see they were right on my heels and besides, I didn't want to be in bad taste. So I just took two quick looks. Are you always in such good taste? Oh, no, only when I'm in a hurry. Yes. The grand, the grand duke is killed cray embankment third accident in this spot in exactly the same way we'll investigate it once get the cars who's in charge, Cressie Lucian. Lucian rope off the place, hold the witnesses. No communications, get the search lights and the baby tests. Come on, Reynold. Strange coincidence. The Grand Duke just left Moloch. They all dead for any witnesses. We're the buddy down man. Come on. Is this the man you saw at the chateau? Yes, I'm pretty sure it is. Come to my say this was found on the chauffeur, this on the older gentleman and these on the man in uniform. It's a lot of money for a French Officer Marseille. It's a wealthy family. Go right up and talk to General Mola. Find a way to see that girl but be very careful. You don't make the general suspicious and what made them swerve off at this point. The other car didn't skid. This is not a signboard, it looks like a moving picture screen, get some keys and I miss, how do you help with those keys? Could I be of any assistance? What do you mean? I think maybe I could open it for you. Thanks. Why? That's a projection machine? A knock there sound equipment. Mm. Yeah, I'm worried. Get muon. What, what it there are to be no more cut flowers? Is that clear? I am not a man that tolerates what you have allowed to happen here. Money and jewelry are missing. That means there has been an intruder in my house. That is not to happen again. Is that clear General Mueller. I want to see General Molo. No, come in at night. Yeah, this is my card. You wait here, Justin Ma be wise to call a doctor. I'm afraid her reason is going. The are my father you needn't worry. I've seen this happen before. Every reminder of that tragic day upsets her. All she needs is a rest. I shall stay with her. Don't make me see it again. You must be very tired. My good night. Flowers, please. Leon. The opera 11. Leon lay on. Yeah. General stay here. General Molo. I am honored by a visit from the sit down, please. I regretted my visitors occasioned by very sad news. The Grand duke or his highness. He was here early in the evening, his automobile met with an accident. I'm sorry to say he was killed. Oh, this is a terrible shock. I hardly know what to say on the body of the grand duke was a communication for the princess, Anastasia that I am compelled to deliver to her. Personally. I dislike disturbing her highness at this hour. I understand perfectly. If you'll excuse me for a moment, I will prepare the princess for this dreadful news and arrange for her to see you. Thank you. I tried to break the news as quietly as I could, but the princess fainted. I'm afraid any more excitement at this moment would be dangerous under the circumstances. I'd better come back tomorrow morning. Get the motor boat ready. We are leaving by the secret passage. Have the car meet us at high Bridge, telephone the airport immediately hurry. Yes, general should ask her. You're ready for an emergency. Keep your eyes open. Stay close by go. You should you shame me? Mhm. Leon. Leon, darling. It was near this saw that Lazos body was found. Yes, this must lead directly into the chateau. Why don't we go in the front way? I want to surprise Muller. So he won't have a chance to destroy any evidence up here. Break it down, still get the assembly to guard all entrances. So you wanted to be more of it will take more than the police of pace to catch me. What a beautiful statue you would make the most beautiful statue I have ever made with a keen blade after the thirst. It is very peaceful. It will not be like this for you. However, you see how quiet she is now, how much like Mar, I think we're just in time. Don't touch him. You'll be electrocuted. We don't doubt you when you say that you're going straight, but we prefer that you do it outside of France. You have just two hours to catch your boat. Good luck madam Reynold. Thank you. By the way, all the time that you were helping us, we noticed that various pieces of jewelry disappeared. We have a vague idea where they went. But would you mind telling me one thing, why were the counter Marseille's valuables left untouched? I'm sure he was a Frenchman. So about that, I never robbed Frenchman, but I had to have a souvenir of our acquaintance. Come on down, overtake that car and be sure Reynold doesn't miss the boat. Yes, Mr.
