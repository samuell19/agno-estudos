- There he is! Get him! Quickly! What are you hiding? Show me it! Help me! Momo! Peace. - Let's go! Come On. Remember this, huh. We'll be around. Thank you! Thank you. Don't mention it... I'm not afraid of anybody. Perhaps I'll give this to you... As appreciation. What is it? A time machine. Well...thank you. You don't want to try it? You're the scientist. Like this. Push, push, push... I'm not afraid of anything. It's, it's, it's...coming! Kai! Momo...! ADVENTURES OF ELECTRIC ROD BOY Stinks! Who is it? You are alive, Dr. Sariba. I got it! I don't know what's going on... But let me apologize anyway. An apparition. What the hell are you with an electric rod! May I ask where I'am? Ochita! Huh? Hey. Please fight them for me. Fight back, but how? That stink! That stink. I've decided it's time for the Adam stink... Agree? Agree?? An interesting idea. Good bye now...! - I've bee waiting for...truly. - Huh? I knew you were coming... With the power of the rod. Pardon me...But where am'I? Where did I come to? - This is twenty five years from where you were. - Huh? Twenty five years later? About fifteen years ago, a vampire group called Shinsen-gumi emerged from the dark world, deploying a being called Adam Jr. I caused the world to be covered in a black cloud. Humans were hunted by vampires, captured for food and experiments. But the cloud of Adam Jr. is limited... Both in time and space. They are desperate to improve the bomb with a huge amplifier. The amplifier is generated and nurtured by a female captive. - Do you understand why you're here? - Huh? - You... - What about me? - ...You will soon. - What? You're here to annihilate their operation. Good bye. I know you need me for guidance. I also know that the rod will help us... As long as we're working together. Yes...you're rod. Actually, you're rod just helped me. I wonder if...that was really help. Thank you very much for your help. I will give you a special medal. Kai...It looks very good on you. Not yet...are you sure it will be completed? Of course. My machine needs energy from a human being for it to grow and mature. My machine is growing before your very eyes. But when this girl reaches maturity, my machine will also reach it. But what kind of time are you talking about? Usually a girl reaches maturity at about fourteen or fifteen... Perhaps the girl is defective! So you want to try it from a baby again? We must hurry, the sky looks dangerous! Another Adam Jr! I understand... I understand our problem. We're running out of Adam Jr. and our project is behind schedule. No matter what... Trust me and wait for me. When we finish the Adam special, we will cover the sky forever ...with a huge black cloud. It'll be a beautiful world without light. Eternal darkness...ha, ha. As long as darkness prevails, we will be immortal. Immortal life and beauty... is our destiny...soon. Then, I will bite you girl; you will know immortality, too. So continue to produce the darkness. Your name is Eve. Girl, you must menstruate, quickly! We must destroy... Their secret weapon... Before it's complete! Kai...you are the only person. You are the hope. Work hard...Become strong... Bear it with me... You are the one! Beat Shinsen-gumi! Assure, darling, the power of this boys rod will help us. Assure me...I can't believe it. There's an evil presence here... What is it? She's a sacrifice... We should help her. I'm ready to...Fight somebody! Don't waste your life. Hello... You deserve this. Deserve it! If you severe the tube to Adam special, Eve will die. If you want to do it... Go ahead and do it. Here... Teacher! Teacher! This seemed to be so important to you... Caviar...Do you want some? - I love you. - Come on. Let's go! Out of the way! Kai. Now it's time for you to use the power of the rod! Kai. Show me your power. I'am...I'am...Sorry! What the hell? Well... The same old technique doesn't work! Fuck you!! Stop, an old woman and a kid... They don't taste so good. Let's go home. Eve... I've already sucked her blood. She will live forever...Beautiful forever. Eve... This is her photo album. Teacher used to be very beautiful. And cute. And cool. Twenty five years old...Twenty two... Twenty... Eighteen years old... I became an old woman didn't I? My husband often said... The world would be covered in darkness. Ever since I was very young. But we had to wait patiently, until you came to help us. I'am very sorry for being useless. I'm sorry too... It was a lot of trouble for you, too. I'm very sorry, too. Tell me, where is your husband? He flew away... Flew? The day Shinsen-gumi detonated Adam Jr. for the first time He said he had something he needed to do. He flew into the swirl of the black cloud... Looking down at me... As I screamed, covered in ash. Is...There something wrong with me face? You... Somehow...The setting suns rays pierce the black cloud... What a pleasant reminiscence. But...This is the last sunset we'll be experiencing. Good bye, sunshine. Good bye...forever. There's no more Adam Jr. We don't want to see morning... We must use Adam special during the night. You are... Are you all right? Who is it? I'am the one who brought you here, beyond the time barrier. Then...Then, you must be the servant of the time machine. You could call me that... - But honestly, I'am an electric rod boy, too. - What? Whenever the world has a crisis... An electric rod boy is born. An electric rod boy is a messiah who sheds light on the era... Paving the way for the next coming. We are the heroes who rescue humans throughout history! Hero? When I traveled from the Edo period, I didn't find you here. Then I looked for you everywhere thoughout time. I finally find you goofing off in the world, twenty five years ago. What a dim wit, I thought. I was ashamed and I wondered... How could this rod boy help to rescue the world? Hey! Get up... If you don't wake up now... The world will be swallowed into darkness...forever. It's coming closer to dawn. Are you ready yet? Something's wrong with the machine. Are you certain she had her fist period? I showed you the blood! But maybe you raped her... And it's the blood from the hymen? How can you say that? Did you do it? Do it quickly! Start Adam special! No way...Adam isn't mature yet. We can't wait... Well' be destroyed before sunrise. Eve is dying! We can't wait any longer! Okita...Okita!! Alright...Alright! So that's the secret cave. I'll shoot Adam special. Now you're name is also Eve. You'll bring darkness to this world again! Teacher, careful! Teacher...Teacher! Momo. Fifteen years old...That's Momo. Sariba...That's Momo's name. Teacher. You are Momo! Healthy, strong Momo. Disappeared from this world so easily. I couldn't do anything to help Momo. Teacher... I'am sorry...! No way! Like I thought. I was too early! You did a great job. You are a strong link between the eras. You are the hero... Rod Boy... If you hadn't brought light to this world... Dark would've moved through the time tunnel everywhere! My light will fail soon... I'am only strong enough to bring light to my era. The tower of the light is only strong enough for your own time. Now it's your turn to look for the next Rod Boy... Through the time tunnel. When you have a link with him, he will light up... Your mission will be accomplished. Even though one light is extinguished... As long you've made the link, the light will continue. History repeats itself... That's a fact. History repeats itself... That's a fact. I knew about you... I was fighting in B-Region. Against a vampire, too... Your mother was correct. You rescued the world. Momo. I'am the daughter of you and Momo Sariba...Understand? Huh? What's going on here? - That's my question. - Huh? You disappeared all of a sudden and now you're back with something new on your rod. Huh, what? Are you Momo?? What's wrong? Are you Momo? You're weird... You are very weird. The future will be ugly... There will be a crisis. As teacher Sariba and the other Rod Boy said: I must jump into the time tunnel when the moment comes. Otherwise, the world will be destroyed. But, if you are patient... Rod Boy will come and help you... That is my promise... I will help Momo in the future. The destiny of the world... Depends...on...me. Do you have a fever? I will cherish the image of you in the album forever. I will take care of you very well. Teacher Sariba's album will stay like new and she won't die. - Let's go home. - Yes. Charge... What? It turned off... I'll get it back on...
