Yes, you are such a big boy. You are sweet. Yes ... We can only get money for the two. There is not enough. Just let them stand. Come on. Oh ... Oh. Do you know where mom is gone, what? Do You Know? Come over here. Have you missed us? We have been in school. He should be called something. I run a finger down the page - - Then you say stop. Do not peek. - Are you going to say stop? - Stop ... What does it say? Ulla. He can't be named that. No, you wouldn't be named that, would you? Jette Stick. Heide. Mette Helming. - But he is a boy. - We will try again. - Say now stop, damn. - Okay, stop. It's a good name. Try looking here. - It is very good. - We take that. In The fathers - - And the Holy Spirits ... spirit - You say that? - Yes, keep your mouth shut now. We do it right. Like in a church. Where is ... Where is my vermouth? You have taken it, no? You also took my cigarettes, right? Nick, give me my vermouth. You have been drinking it yourself. - What? - You drank it. See, she has pissed on the floor again. She is so creepy. Nick? - Do you think he is sick? - No, he should just sleep. Want some food? I've made something for you. Do you sleep? Wake up ... Wake up. Wake up now. Wake up now, damned. Wake up now. Wake up now! No! No. ...! No! Hi, Nick. Nick, it's Sophie. I made some coffee. Nick... What the hell is happening? - What is it? - Come in. He had something spiky hair. He was so sweet. I want a lot of children. You can't even look after him you have. - Relax. I can as well. - Do you ever see him? Relax. You don't nedd to be so pissed all the time. - Do you need a haircut? - Don't. Shall I get you to relax? Will you lie down? You may lie here. - You may sleep here. - Otherwise, thank you. - You never bother to sleep here. - See you. - Hello. - Hide and seek! - Hello ... - Who is it? Hello? - No, not you again. What are you doing? - You make a noise. You've stayed at this hostel for five months, right? - And then what? - Here we are talking nicely to each other. - I ask you something very simple. - Don't ask me anything. Goodbye. Huttelihut. I have asked you to turn down, so I can sleep. - No? - Yes. Turn off the radio, and don't stomp around like you own the place. It's Sophie. - What have you done with your hand? - Out. Leave me in peace. Do you understand? Hey... Hey, Nick. Come here. - Ivan? - Can't you help me up? Damn, man. What happened? I just looked at their car. And got to touch a little about it. And then they freaked out completely. Fuck, it hurts, man. Shall I come and look at your car again, what? Are you idiot or what? You can get some more, if you will, man! Listen here ... Want more beatings? - No thanks. - So shut up. What's happened to you, man? Are you being such a, you go and beat on, or what? - Do you go and collect bottles? - It's my bag. What the hell are you doing, man? Come here, we beat them! Ivan, they are run. What the hell are you doing? We beat them. Come on Nick, we beat them. I beat them! Stop them! I arrived at a hospital out in Hvidovre. They did not understand a damn thing, man. - They just gave me pills. - Why should you have pills? It was something, I haven't seen my father for ten years. He is still in Serbia. I've been waiting for him. So I tell them: "Do not talk about my father." Then pass it all, man. And then they threw me out. - What about your mother? - My mother? My mother died of drinking. We buried her three weeks ago. Ohh ... Was your brother there? Yes, of course. I thought you were sitting in jail. - Were you released, or ...? - Of course I was released. - Okay. - I came out three months ago. Have you seen my sister? No. Why were you in jail? What happened? - I can't remember. - You will not remember it. My sister threw you out, and the whole week after you went berserk. You beat one. - Eat, I'm going. - Relax, Nick. Want to hear something weird? I couldn't taste anything in a whole week. No matter what. I drank a lot. Then there was this guy. A completely random. I knocked him down. Hard. Do you still have the A? Ana. She will not see me anymore. My own sister. - Why not? - It's a little strange ... Sometimes I get such ... What do you mean that it is strange? She was sleeping at home with my mother. So I'd put myself beside of her. Like when we were kids, right? And then I came to do ... You know, kind of ... - Fuck it. - Did you paw her? No ... It was not meant, right? - It's sick, Ivan. - I know. I think about it all the time. - Have you ever had sex with a girl? - I have fucked many. Not really. I get sad, when you talk about it. I'm sorry. I try to think of something else. So don't start it. I try to think of cars. I'm looking at cars to think about anything else. To some big, wet tits - - And a butt that rubs my belly. - And sperm over her head. - Okay, fine. I get mad. I am also thinking at things, that are not normal. Ivan, calm. I understand. - Now, you don't begin to cry, right? - Well I do not. - In hell, man. - I've missed you crazy, Nick. You were like a brother to me. - How long has it been? Two years? - I have no idea. - I think it's two years ago. - Is it? Come here, Nick. I've missed you. You should sit in my kitchen with my sister, and eating crackers. - Can you remember? - Yes, lovely ... I know what we need. - Good evening. Welcome. - Thanks. My friend Ivan must have a suck'n fuck. Sorry. Sorry ... I bought a sweater for you. Hello. Take it on. I have also followed a girl. I wouldn't do something to her, Nick. Ivan. What then? I just followed behind her. So she went into a staircase, and I slipped in before the door closed. I would just walk past her. Past her hair. Just smell her, you know. Just when I shall pass by her, she turns around and looks at me. Then she begins just to scream and scream - - And I can't handle it. So she got one on the head man. And then I run down the stairs. Away. I wouldn't do something to her, Nick. I just wanted ... ... sense her. - What then? - He's staring at my lady's ass. - You drool over her. - If you don't have to look ... - What then? - So she shouldn't be that way. - Do yourself, your fucking cheese! - She's bursting with bum ... Do you play smart? No, stop! - Now we go. - What are you doing? Idiots! What the hell is happening, man? - What happens? - It's not me. It is with Sophie. For according to child psychologist the municipality - - It is important that children have contact with their biological mother. Bent! Take, however, your shoes on, dammit. You may well have shoes on, you just not to stomp around. - Hey, what's going on here? - Hey, Nick. This is my son. It's Nick. - Say what you called. - I have no desire to say something. Well, his name is Tobias. How did you get hold of him? Mom, I'm hungry. We go a little bit. You get some food, once you've played a little more. - Comes Dad soon? - No, he comes only a little later. I'm leaving. See you. Hi. - Who is it? - It's me. - What? - Can you help us in two minutes? - With what? - Can he be with you for two minutes? There has been a misunderstanding. The police are here. - And? - I come. It's just two minutes. Sit overthere. Here is a little messy but you may submit to. Did she just picked you up? No, he's not. Just take it easy. It stops soon. I do not know. He is in kindergarten, I assume. Do you want to go home to your father? I can go by myself. Hello. This is Tobias. I think it's him, I'm looking for. Come, we go in to me, darling. You know what ...? Don't! Ouch... damned! Release him. Now! Do you hear? Release him! You called to - - 23 52 01 44. Leave a message. Hi, this is your big brother. I would like to get hold of you. Hi, Nick. Are you stoned? Haven't you slept yet? Do you sleep here? Yes. - Explain to me again what we are doing here. - You must see her, Nick. Who's car is that? - If you follow a girl again ... - Calm down. Wait and see. It's Ana. It's her birthday. Ana took such a pregnancy test - - Which was positive. I said, I thought, we should have it. But it was evident the wrong thing to say - - Because she went from me. She got an abortion. That was it. Fuck, it's a long time ago. Would you like to have children? With her I wanted it all, man. I also think that you would be good to take car of a small child. Go ahead. Thank you. Then she was bathing and began beating her. - Then she ran out. - It's too crazy. She did not come out again, so ... She was still a little fat one. - So you were perhaps glad to escape? - Yes. Do you think I'm cute? Just say if there is something I shall do. - Want to touch my breasts? - Yes. Should I just ...? Yes. I can help you. Shall I help you? Have you never tried it before, Ivan? It's okay. It's pretty cute. You may well move further down. - Can you feel that I'm wet? - Yes. I go out in ten minutes. Hello. I want my brother's address. I have a phone number. Who are you? I'm looking for my brother. He lives there. There are no home. He hasn't been home the last few weeks. Just that nothing has happened. He was so sweet, your brother. And so to him the sweet little Martin. - Is there something wrong? - No, no, I ... I've never seen how he lives. I've removed the ads. So nobody can not see, that he is not home. If you see him, say, that he shall call me. - If he shows up, right? - Okay. Thank you. Hey! Ivan! Hi, Nick. - What are you doing? - Nick? You must be out here. It is not so good in there. What the hell are you talking about? Stop ... No, stop, Nick! What happens? - Ivan! - It was just because ... Suddenly she began to scream. I wanted her to stop. Ivan! Stop it. I can't take it anymore. - Hello, darling. - Hi, Dad. What do you draw? Me and mom. And then I'm Zorro costume. - Are you ready to go home? - Just about two seconds. Really. Hello, darling. - Had we forgotten lunch again? - Yes. Sorry. - Do we just buy some food then? - Jes. Dad, I want toast. Okay, toast. But also something healthy, right? - Should you drive the car? - Yes.

It don't looks like a space rocket. - It took a while. - Yes, okay. Want some food? No thanks. I'm going. - Thanks for the help, V?rle. - Okay. They write that you get him late, and he seems tired and aggressive. He sleeps badly at the moment. He thinks much of her mother. Martin's mother was in a car accident two years ago. Both you and Martin's mother were junkies? - Have you started taking drugs again? - No, not at all. - You don't seem to feel good. - Well ... Okay. - I think it's flu ... - I don't think you understand the seriousness. We have started a process - - which can end a placement of your boy. It will be assessed if you are able to take care of him. Okay. - Shall we say it, in the first place? - Yes. And regarding cash assistance ... Just forget it. We'll find out. You can get three days' advance. Just one more thing. I don't care about anything else than my boy, okay? - Dad, I'm hungry. - Okay. Sit straight and look a little television, right?
