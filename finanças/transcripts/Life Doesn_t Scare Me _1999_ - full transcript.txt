- I want to see - You want to? You're my little apple... And that's my big apple. I have a gift for you. It's so small, your eyes can't see it. It's so small. Make your mommy happy, huh? Please. Good job! You'll get your dress all dirty! Life is hard, huh? Your mom loves you so much. You shouldn't cry. You shouldn't cry. You shouldn't cry. Come inside, Jacqueline. Come inside. Hello, Mr. Nuc-nuc, how are you? Very well, Mrs. Pouët-Pouët, I've worked a lot today. I made rice pudding. And I'm mad because my daughter won't come out of her shell. What do you mean, she doesn't want to come out of her shell? - Get out, girl, or you'll get a spanking! -She doesn't want to hear it What is the name of your daughter, Madame Pouët-Pouët? - Jacqueline. - Come on, get out, Jacqueline! "LIFE DOESN'T SCARE ME" Subtitles by: HAUTBASFRAGILE She sucks. - Hi. - Hi. It's only true stories. Here, for example, is the story of a woman who gave birth... when doctor arrived, the baby had snuck an arm out, and suddenly it's stuck. The doctor tries to put the arm back inside but it's impossible. So he is forced to cut off the arm, to put the baby back the right way. - It's horrible, isn't it? - And the baby? He died. Probably because he lost too much blood. But the doctor had no choice, otherwise the baby and the mother both die. It must be horrible to have your arm cut off like that. He must've wondered what was happening to him. Maybe he passed out, and didn't feel anything. But I don't think so. There you go. A real big girl hairstyle. Christian Renucci was found guilty of murdering Maria Dolores on June 3, 74. Guilty of kidnapping her, then cutting her throat and disfiguring her. Jurors of the Assize Court, stood behind the AG, who's demanding the death penalty "I want the death penalty," he declared, "because the abduction and murder of a child is..." Enough, eh? Marion Belanger? Where is she, Marion Belanger? Here. You seem to know the answers. Are you interested in archaeology? Have you done any internships? No, I didn't do an internship. Well, hats off! - I think she has a brother in high school. - Yes, he's the guy with brown hair. But this will not be the case with all your teachers. So be careful, huh? Good night. Excuse me, I forgot to turn the light off. Did I say "good night"? I didn't say "good night". Good night! The lights. Damn it! - Excuse me, have you seen my scotch tape? - No, No! Ah no, it's not here. Sorry! Piss off! What about my scissors, have you seen them? Stop, you're stupid. You're so stupid! There's absolutely no point in what you're doing. You know why ? No, please. No! What the hell is this mess? Do you see the condition of your room? You see what time it is? You better put everything in its place, quickly! I'll come check. - Decency, do you know it? - What? You've been stepping on my foot for an hour. - I stepped on your foot? - You forgot to evolve! If man evolved from apes, you forgot to evolve! Action! No no. We said you'd call him first. Hello. It's me, John. I'm at the airport. I'll be there right away. - I missed you, you know? - OK, I'll wait for you. - Who was that, mom? - It's none of your business, dear. And now you have to go to bed. - Oh no! - Oh yes! And you're going to obey nicely, otherwise you know how it's gonna end? - Yes mom. - So, quick! Oh, my dear. I finally found you. I need to talk to you, John. - It's over between us. - No, not now! John needs to find you with the other guy. And then they fight. You say nothing for now. Oh my love! I so want to touch you. Come to bed right now. - Fuck off! - What? You keep groping me! -Don't get mad. We'll do something else. - It's true, It's annoying! - We'll do something else. - Yeah, what? I had five husbands, and my favorite was the first. His name was Gary. He had blue eyes. He died in the war. I had seven husbands, because I liked to change. I was very popular. As soon as I went out, men came from everywhere They gave me presents. They would say "Stella, I love you" "I can't live without you, you are the woman of my life." But I couldn't choose all of them, so sometimes they fought, and I watched I lived ten years in a caravan. I had three horses, five dogs, three cats, a baby panther and hummingbirds flying above the trailer all the time. And then I had a monkey, called Fifi. He was with me all the time... He understood everything I said. He was super smart. During the war, a bomb fell on my house. I had three children who died instantly. And another child who lost two arms and two legs. I did everything to treat him but he ended up dying anyway. I went looking for big blocks of ice in the mountains. Then I brought them back to Africa. I had invented a special packaging so that it wouldn't melt. A bomb exploded right in front of my eyes and for a month I was blind Because he cried so much, he wanted to give me his own eyes - But I said I didn't want to. - So I had to sell the ranch... to my worst enemy. Come on, come on, let's go! Come on, let's step it up! It's your fault! - What happened? - She pissed me off. - It's okay, I don't care. It's happened before. - What ? - I beat a girl before. - Why? - I argued with her. - Why? I don't remember, it's been a long time. I went to her house, I kicked her I beat her up and then I said "Bye". Make a wish and touch your cheek. The fifth ballerina was completely naked. The sixth ballerina was completely naked.

It's good. -But it looks like it tightens the eyes. - Not if you don't go around corners. Otherwise, not only does it tighten, but it also gives you fish-eye. - You're here ? - She's gone. Are you happy? You got what you wanted, huh? No, you're not going to cry now. Stop! Stop! Stop immediately! She abandoned you. - Well, I have to go. - One more! - No, I have to go. - Two minutes, I'll put it back. - You're so annoying. Come on! Come here! Come on. Come on you're not doing it well.

Dominique is a boy's and girl's name. - I don't really like "Dominique". - "Claude" too, it goes for both. - That's my father's name. - It wouldn't suit him at all. - I think he looks like a boy. - It's a boy. - It's so soft, it's amazing. - You are my love! - Leave it to me a bit. - Wait. Hey, I can never take it home because of my mom. Let me watch it for a bit. - It's really as if it's someone. - It is someone. Not like that! The rope above the foot. Come on, Emily.

Jerome, would you like to have a coffee with me? - Have a coffee? - Yes, now, it's very important. - OK? - OK. Just there - You good? - Yeah. - I have something intimate and important to ask you. - Go ahead. - Don't laugh. It's not funny. - Nobody said it was funny. I wanted to ask you if you would like to sleep with me once? - Well then! - I told you it wasn't funny. It's okay, it's not the end of the world. - It is - It's not. - Do you want to? - Hold on.

Lemonade for me, and some toast would be nice too I'll bring the toasts later - You sure you haven't forgotten anything? - Stop! Emilie. I'm not sure I understand what you did. On your tray, there must be five cups, a teapot. I see nothing. Alright, we're gonna fix this. Somebody give me books, a pen, anything. Here It's fragile. Now try again. Isn't it too heavy? Wait, I'll help you a little. Good God, Emily. I saw nothing there. Your tray got smashed. It made noise. I saw nothing! The mugs are shattered! You probably got burned from the hot tea But there's nothing there! You're here picking it up quietly - I have to go join the others. - What do you give a fuck about the others? You're in this situation here, right now. Come on! - Do I have to mop the floor, then? - Figure it out! My poor girl, You really are the Goose Girl. They're worth a fortune, those mugs. Come on, react right away! That's too bad. You didn't hurt yourself, I hope? Stop. Emilie There's little that's good. The rest is really rubbish. Well, we'll resume on Wednesday. It's a good sign when he says that. I'm parked outside. She's looking at us. - She's really turned on. - Calm down... Tonight, you do it. Hi, little French one, wanna hang out? Get off, I'll take care of it. Hold this, you'll see She'll be following me like a little puppy Hey, wait! You speak Italian? Like your mother! Wait, wait. Stay, we'll talk. Why would I talk to you? Because you are beautiful like Catherine Deneuve. Wait, come sit. I don't feel like it. Let's get out of here, then? In the Vespa? No, that's my friend's. Come on, stop it. Will you come for a walk? Where is the restroom? - The restroom? - Over there. - Do you want to stay with me afterwards? - Yeah. It's not in Yes, it is. It's not. I know better than you! I'm sorry. But you agreed! It's done! ♪ ♪ Get in the car! We'll take you home No! Let go of her! It's some guys from the club. Fine, but you won't separate us. We're staying together. One of you comes with me!

I find it silly. In 15 minutes, I'll do my back. - I'm not too red, here? - It's not bad. - I'm too hot. I don't feel good. We don't even have water. - Go swimming! I'd rather go back. I'll wait for you at the camp. - What do you want to drink ? - I already have a drink. Do you mind if I sit here? As long as you don't stop me from written this letter. - Who are you writing to? - My parents. Oh yeah? Are you going to talk about me? - Nope. - But you should! - I have to finish my letter, okay? - Okay. You're so beautiful. Too beautiful! - Thanks. - We're getting married, you and I. - Yes that's it. - I'm glad you agree. - Leave me alone! - But I love you. I love you. - What's your name? - Marion. I'm Chesere. - Come take a ride with me. - No. - No. - I won't hurt you. You know I love you. I am very serious. - Come with me. - No. Don't touch me. I hate it! Alright, I won't touch you. It's hard, but I'll wait a bit. OK? A bit. Listen, I wish to be alone. OK? So leave me alone. But I can't leave you alone, Marion. We're getting married. Don't leave. If you leave, I'll go home and kill myself. - I don't care about life. - I don't give a shit about life either. Maybe I'm lying, but maybe I'm telling the truth. Farewell, then! Bitch. A woman will always prefer an unhappy man, because... a young girl is always tempted by an active love. You know what that means? Men are too busy. Love, for them, is not a priority. Chatting with their wife... Walking with her in the park, shedding a few tears on her grave, that's all. And for us, love is life itself. I love you. And that means I want to dispel your sadness. That I want to follow you to the end of the world. The more effort there is, the more beautiful love is. That's to say... You understand, we feel it. "Active love"? - Rubbish. Girlish philosophy. - Good. She is ridiculous. Why ? I'd say we didn't believe it. Maybe she didn't put enough conviction into it. I think she didn't believe it. And she doesn't have the physicality. No, I think she has problems in life preventing her from being in her role. She was too tense there. I don't know. I feel like she had no fun on set. It's because she's a bad actor. It's true. She was just bad. It's a shame because she has abilities. - Because she's fake. - We didn't believe it for a second. She is ridiculous because she loves without return. Because a woman in this situation is always ridiculous. People who insist on wearing white pants on rainy days are beyond me. So I'm Ms. Petit, which didn't influence me much, as you can see. And for those of you who don't know yet, I'm your philosophy teacher. There's one thing that I can't tolerate. It is to see people get up at once as soon as the bell rings, without worrying if I have finished my sentence or if one of their colleagues has a question. I don't intend to be too strict, but as the dean once said... when I was at the faculty, you have to know one thing: The bell here is me. So what is philosophy? You know that your bag is like a uterus? So, are you coming? No, we can't. We have to study. Soon enough you'll all be put away in little boxes. You make me sick. Everyone is so stupid. If you don't give a shit about getting your degree, we don't care. Stop freaking out, You'll get your degree. It's inevitable. You, shut up! Fuck, shut up! Shit! - What's going on? - Nothing, sir. She's got a headache. I'm not sure you really had time to work on it. Have you worked on it? - Yes. - You are sure ? Yes, I assure you. Not every day, but almost. What piano do you have at home? Is it an electric piano by any chance? I don't have a piano at home. You don't have a piano? But how do you do it? -Do you play on someone else's? - Nope. I work like this, on a table. But it's not the same thing at all! Do you know someone who has a piano? - A friend, I don't know... - No. Well, yes, I know someone, but he lives in Rouen. I'm so sorry, Stella. But if you don't have a piano, There's no point in taking lessons. - Really? - It's impossible. - You won't make any progress. - Oh okay. I'm sorry. - You really wanted to play the piano? - Yes. - Why ? Because it's important to know how to play an instrument. When we get old, we become different. - If you find a piano, come back to me. - OK. Couldn't she lend it to me for an hour from time to time, her piano? Would it have killed this bitch to ask me to play on her piano? Won't you have some cake? Would you go get us a cupcake? I'm the only one making an effort here. - There's a man in the pool. - Stop messing around! - But there's a man in the pool. - Stop! - We have to save him. - Go ahead. Dive.

What is this stuff? What did she drink? Chocolate. It must be chocolate, yeah. There's no more Mrs. Peel!? No, there are three now: there's Steed, Purdey and Gambit. No Mrs. Peel. If they are three, it's less good. Maybe it'll be good anyway. I liked Mrs. Peel. Yeah me too. And who did you prefer? Mrs. Peel or Tara King? I liked Tara King but I think I prefer Mrs. Peel. - It's less good that they are three. - You'll get used to it. "What is a normal man?"

I'll be fed up after a year. - You have the right to change your mind. - But you have to register somewhere. For me there is no problem. You tell me "I want to learn painting", I say "OK". You tell me "I want to go to theater school", I say "OK". You tell me "I want to become a social worker", I say "OK". Just tell me what you want to do. - I don't know. - There's many things that interest you! That's true, I see that you're interested in many things. In addition, you're gifted for many things: to write, to draw. And you love taking care of children. You remember, you told me you wanted to become a speech therapist. Not a speech therapist. What interests you the most? There are things I want to do. But they're jobs that don't exist. - What jobs? What do you mean, "Don't exist"? Tell us, you can explain to us. It's not worth it. I know it doesn't exist. Hey, you're very good at writing. Do you remember when you made up lots of stories? Would you like to become a writer? You don't realize. You know, not long ago, I reread all the letters from when you were in camp. It was amazing how you wrote. It's true. During the whole year, I was angry at them, calling them bitches. But when I didn't get my degree on first round, It woke me up I said to myself "what a nightmare I'm going to repeat, and be all alone". "What is happiness?" Does it exist? Maybe yes, maybe not. Besides, we don't care. Is it an ideal? Yeah, an ideal. A projection? Yeah. “A projection of what?”, he'll ask. A projection of my hand in your ugly face. - You didn't get it? - I did. Go tell your dad! - What do you want? - I got my degree. - Huh? You got it? how did you do it? - I don't know. I'm paying for the round. She got her baccalaureate! When I came back from vacation, my parents were getting a divorce. My father took off with the cash register. My mother attempted suicide. So I found my mom with no money, no heating at home. It was divorce. I didn't think that would happen. I thought if I had my diploma, I would never be a waitress. What is my sweetheart thinking today? What is she doing again? Is she in love? - Straight ahead? - Yes, go on. Go right ahead, not like the last time. Oh she put the gear right to my knee! Well done! I told you to go right ahead and you did. Well done. What did we do over the weekend? - I wrote a poem. - I didn't know you wrote. I really like poetry. Often it comes to me. I write a poem. - Would you like to hear my poem? - Oh yes, yes! It's called "Solitude". "Solitude". I really like this title. So: The night has already fallen like an autumn leaf I feel my heart tighten and its beat resounds I am alone in the dark streets, you are long gone. I forgot the word "hope" and my heart aphyxiates without you. Can you read the last line again? I didn't quite hear. "and my heart aphyxiates without you." It's beautiful, isn't it? It's very beautiful, but I wonder if it shouldn't be "asphyxiates". - "Asphyxiates". - Yes. - I think it's the verb "asphyxiate". - You think ? I'm not quite sure, but I think so. Either way, it's very pretty. - What do I do now? - Behind the blue car. Parallel. - It's my boyfriend's car. - What is his name ? - Phillip. He's 29 years old, almost 30. - And what does he do? - He's doing three licenses at once. She's nailing her parallel parking when her Phillip is here. If she applied herself like that more often, it would be better. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, sweetheart. We couldn't get married, because he's not Jewish When you grandmother saw him, she said: "Not bad, shame he's not Jewish" So I left the house like I was going to work. And never came back. We sent telegrams to my parents to inform them we were married. And we took a boat to France. When we passed Ecuador, we had a party. We'd throw flour on girls and throw them in the water - But I wasn't part of it, because I was pregnant. - With me ? Of course with you! We resume, right away. Come on, everyone in place, please. - Damn, I'm going to faint. - Are you hypoglycemic? Thank you all. We're done for the day. - Alright, shall we go out? - Yeah, yeah. You know you're going to be punished for this? You must be punished for this. - I think I'm going to rape you. - Then go ahead. - Provocation? - Would you like to do it? - Why do you say that? - Would you like to do it? - And you? - Would you like to try? - Would you like to try? - If you want. Yeah. - You're sure? - Yeah. Stop! Stop Stop. Stop. Stop. Bastard! Jennifer Sollers, your album came out three weeks ago and has already sold over a million copies. Rumors says you're burying Madonna. Do you feel like you've hit your goals? No, the goal is always far. It's like the plane trees on the road. There's always another one after. But the roads always lead somewhere! To death. That's a nice answer. Jennifer, your album is called "pure sex". But listening to it, I found it very romantic. It touches me that you say that. How far do you want to go in your philosophy studies? I don't know. At least until I get my license. And what would you do with this license? Drug trafficking. It was a joke. Philip was telling us you weren't sure you'd pass the year No,no. I'm not worried at all. I had said that at a time when I had missed important classes and was sick. But I caught up very well, and I scored good notes. Excuse me, I'm going to the bathroom. You do what you want. I don't think you'll be happy with this girl. I decided to leave her and I haven't told her yet. Here, your monthly. - Hi. - Hi. - You had no trouble coming? - No no. Because they said there might be strikes, so we wondered. - No, I got the subway right away. - Yeah, it went quickly? - How are you? - Good. I feel stupid but it's okay. Oh, Emilie, Stella. It's been a long time since we saw you. Émilie, Inès told me you work a lot. That you're in cinema. - Yeah. - And you, Stella, what do you do? - Well, I do radio. I'm just starting. That's good too.
