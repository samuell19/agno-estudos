SUBTITLES ARRANGED BY:- SAMAKSH ~ VARSHA ~ PANKAJ JAIN It was mom. How come you're feeling all low suddenly? Nothing. She only wants to know what's the status of my job hunt. I'm fed up of saying that it will be all right. Don't you have two elder brothers in the U.S. and Sydney? No point. Even if they do something, I'd have to hear their taunts about helping me, for my whole life. Didn't you say that your mom went to London? She called from there. - At Kunjumol's place? Yes. She's the only one who wants to help me out in some way. Didn't I tell you that she had sent a UK Visa for me? If nothing is working out here, I'll go there. Don't be so desperate. Something will work out. It's not that. Mom said something unusual today... 'If something happens to me here, you should get me buried back in our hometown'. Ever since I heard that, I feel weird.. That's a usual statement from old people. She's quite healthy, rig ht? She has no health problems as such. Enough. Come. Let's go to some pub. So stylish, right? What is it? Are you feeling tempted? Hey! I have told you something. If God calls me while I am here, you should get me buried in our hometown, okay? It's a promise that you gave me. Stop it, mom! When I made a joke, you're hanging on to that? Com e. It's not yet time for you to go. Trust me! Don't talk too much with your big mouth. I have told the same thing to Jomon as well. Us children will do whatever necessary when it's time. I have two elder sons, right? I don't trust them. They are both multi-millionaires. You know, right? Oh Christ! (chanting prayers) Hey Mercy, I'm getting late. Where's my lunchbox? It's on the table. - It's here. My sweetie... Come on, hurry up. You're already late. Good morning. How come you're quite well dressed today? EM; a Elegant. Okay. See you later. You're getting really late. You need to hurry up, okay? Mom, should I get you coffee now, or afterl come back? You go and come back. Lara, Milan" We're getting late. Hurry up! (Kisses) See yo u. Come on! Bye. - Com e. Come on, fast. Com e, com e. Go! Go! Fast. Get inside. Come on. Okay. Bye, mom. Mom! Mom! Mom! Look at you! Is this the time to sleep? You need to have breakfast & take your medicines. Get up, mom. Mom, get UP- Mom! Mom! Mom! Jesus! Don't extinguish this flame! When she heard that you're coming, she had told me... 'Hey! This time she's coming... to take me also along with her.' She's not really fond of travelling. I know, Mathukkutty. Still, leaving mom alone here like this, how can we stay relaxed over there? But. We are all here for her. But still, if she has to be taken to the hospital suddenly... you know how far it is, rig ht? Hey! If you're done saying bye to dad, shall we leave? What is this? Are you planning to sleep early? I was lying down just like that. I haven't packed my bags yet. Don't pack a lot of stuff. Take only what's absolutely necessary. Rest we can buy from there. But still, I need to carry the necessary stuff, right? Mathukkutty, keep it there. I've packed all the necessary stuff. Open it. Let me see. I know what you're looking for. The Bible, dad's photo, the rosary blessed from Rome, it's all in there. Mom! Mom! Anto! Anto, get up. Get up! Anto! - What is it? Kunjumol called from London. - What happened now? Mom. - She's gone? Yes. Ammini... Ammini, where is the funeral? Gammy]? Then? How can I not go? You should also come. What will I do after coming there? - What will you do? No decision has been made about our ancestral house. It's a chance to get together and take a decision. Go and book the tickets, man! We'll leave the children at Sally's house. Such unwanted trouble. But it's good that we just have to go till London. At least we don't have to go to Kattappana! Such a bad hangover! Hey! If you touch the bottle, I'll chop your hands off. Get lost. Okay. I'll reach. Kids are not here. Let me check the tickets. Mollykkutty? - I'm not coming. Molly is not feeling well. She won't be able to travel now. Okay. Mom didn't find any other time to leave or what? When I called last week, she didn't mention any health problems. I left to the school after seeing mom all dressed up after her bath. What's the point in saying all that now? She's gone, rig ht? You hang up. Let me check tickets. I had a London trip scheduled for next month. If this had happened then... Hey Susan. - Yes. What is it? Well... Mom... Oh no! And yeah.. I have day duty for the whole of next week. I can't come along. What happened? - Your granny is gone. Oh! Poor thing. We will also come to London for granny's funeral. It's my mom who died. I'll take you when your mom dies. I know that you're waiting for it, Benny. Joe... It's Kunjumol, from London. Kunjumol... Moji... What is it? Joe's mother... At London? Yes. Com e. You have the Visa, right? Yes. Don't worry about the ticket. Hey! Just call Nasser lkka. Are you all right? I got through to Jomon. He would be reaching first. Mtmfixtmmamtmmmflnn a There would be good funeral directors and such companies in London, right? Yes, of course. Contact one of them. Anyway, let things be quite grand. All right. Don't worry about the budget. Let us share it. Isn't that how it should be? Yeah. Okay. Oh God! Don't think that I'm praising them! I haven't seen anyone as stingy as your elder brothers! He wants me to share the funeral expense, it seems. Jessie... - Yes. Ask them to keep 2 rolls of paper inside. - Okay. Hey Unni. - Tell me, mom. When is the funeral? All of them should reach here, right? From Canada, U.S. and Australia... It would take 3-4 days. What about the body until then? It's supposed to be kept in the mortuary. But Ammini... Mercy's elder sister... Ammini has an emotional problem. That's the problem now. You stopped going for work after marrying a cardiac surgeon. Out of my desperation, I'm still working as a nurse. Don't us nurses know how bad the methods in mortuaries are? I can't come and see my mother in a mortuary. All frozen up... So, you should keep her in your house itself. And bring the Father from the Church you go to, and offer her final prayers. Even though she's dead, we should take care of her, rig ht? That's the issue, mom. That would bring about harms to you. No doubt about it. We're not like Christians. Once dead, the funeral should be done on time. That's our tradition. It's a house where I set up a Pooja room (Hindu Prayer room) when I came last time. You cannot keep the corpse at home for three days. If you are disobedient, it will be you and your children who will be harmed. My dear Valsamma. I said I'll call you! That doctor is waiting there. Where the hell is Raju, when we have a meeting here? He's about to reach. He just called. - Is his issue with his wife over? No way! Ask him to cry and fall at her feet. He is ready to cry, fall at her feet, and grind coconuts for her. But she should also allow that, rig ht? Morning! Oh! He's here. My dear Raw, where were you'? Cardiac surgeon, Dr. Mukundanunni. He's dead? - Get lost. He's waiting outside. Did anyone die from his family? Em a They're loaded with cash. Her children are in Canada & New York. We can definitely get above 10,000 Pounds. How much? - 10,000 Pounds, dude. What is this, Manoharan? Shouldn't we show some decency? This is the only death that has happened in the past 2-3 months. Let me make a living somehow. Jessie... What are their requirements? Airport pick up and drop for 5 persons. Funeral costume: Male - 10, Female - 5... Just a minute. Kunjachayan is calling. Whenever we're discussing something, he always gets a call. Kunjachayan! Tell me! Hey Raju! What's happening? Going on... It's Kunjachayan. Kunjachayan? Who's that? The ex-MLA of Kerala Congress, Thomas Jacob. His political connection. That party itself is hanging in uncertainty. But Podiyan... There's nothing that Kunjachayan can't do in Kottayam. My dear, I called you... for a boy close to me, from Mannanam. He came to London for some job, and called me saying that he's in some kind of trouble. Will you be able to help him out and get him a job somewhere? Is he really close to you? Yes. He's a distant relative, as well. Othen/vise, why would I call you? Okay! Give him my number, and ask him to call me. Okay. Thank you so much. Okay. Sir... Ybs? - Shall we start, sir? Okay mom. I'll call you. - Okay. Okay. - Okay, fight. Please come. I had told him several times not to get married to that Christian girl. He didn't listen! What to do now? Podiya, get up and sit there. Don't let this go. Hi Doctor. Hello! - Hello! Raju. - Hello Doctor. Please sit down. Doctor, we went through your entire requirements. The entire cost of the funeral will come around... That's okay. Money is not the issue. Okay. - The issue is something else. Aren't they burying the corpse? - Shut up, man. Sorry. Tell me. - That is... Keeping the body at home for two days... it's a slightly delicate problem. Hey! Don't worry, doctor. Once you sign this agreement with us, the first thing we'll do is that... we'll take the body and take it directly to the mortuary. That's the law here. Hey, come on! He knows everything. - Yes! Yes! No! No! It's not that! The problem is... Some family members have an objection in keeping the body in a mortuary. That is the problem. So, what I suggest is... If we can find a space, for two or three days, if we can find a building or a house, we can shift the body there, in a freezing unit. Such a space? To find such a space... Such a space... Well, doctor... Firstly, to find a house to store a dead body is... Neighbours might create a lot of trouble. And, since it is your case... You think about it. Please think about something. Such a space... There is such a space. Your house? - My house? There are other people there. Okay. There is such a space. But the thing is that... See, even if we say that it's for 3 days, they will charge one month rent and... But that doesn't matter. - Okay. You know, we just have to shift it from my house somehow. Okay. We'll do it quickly. - Yes. Thank you very much. - So should we bury her today itself? How? - Not to bury“ Shift! Shift! We have to shift her. We'll do it. What's this, man? Isn't this an office? Awesome! Sandra, is that the key for the Croydon property? Yes. - Okay. Thank you. The property is ready. One month rent would be almost... around 1,600". - One slap I'll give you. One month's rent? What is this, dude? Hey Joy! This is not to settle down as a family. A dead body has to lie there alone forjust 3 days. Dead body is the problem. - What? It doesn't need current or water... Doesn't it need current? Where do we plug in the freezer? - Oh yes. We need a little bit of electricity. Bro, I'm just a caretaker. If the owner knows this... Hey! Don't brag too much. As if the Sheikh sitting in Qatar is going to know this. Okay. We'll give you rent for 10 days. M gem Come, Podiyan. Let's go. - Don't go. Sit there. Let's talk. Tell me. Something more... We won't give. He has reached. He doesn't come anywhere on time. Hey Podiyan... Did you take the body out? We thought we needn't take the body out from the front. We'll take it out from the back. From the back? - That means, from the backside. It's easier to take it out from there too. It's going to get late. - Harry! Yes. - Come. - Let's go. Rest in peace. Careful, careful. What? Mercy... Mercy ! Baby, what are you doing? Mercy... Come on, look at me. Listen... We had no other option. We've done the best we can. Moreover, in this atmosphere where the kids are around, how do we... Please try to understand and come back. Let's go there. Yes. Sorry. It's hardly 2 miles from here. That's all. One of us would always be there. You can come any time. You have our number, right? Just give us a call. Okay. Thank you. Hey! I will call you back, okay? Okay. Is this the Sheikh's place? Bro, has it been long since you reached? Talk softly. Don't shout and let the neighbours know. A rascal stays next door. Adifficult bugger. Hey! Take it inside. Go, Manoharan! Come on! - Me? Come on. - Just hanging around. I'll give you work. Can you please pick up? Please pick up, Rekha! Don't hang up! She hung up! Hey Podiyan! She's not at all heavy. - Look over there. Careful. Come on. What did this aunty eat? Don't step on those plants. Careful. Come on, walk. - I'm walking! What is this? They are carrying a huge box! I think someone has come to stay there on rent. Why are you so shy? I'll drop this, okay? Get inside. Slowly. Why do they need such a big box for that? Must be the furniture for the house. That's all. It would have been great if they were from our place. Why? Loo k! Why from our place? That won't be right. You go inside. Why are you getting angry for that? Look in the corner for a socket to plug this in. -Yes. Harry, is there supply? Yes. There is supply. Come! Hold this. Aunty, we've switched on the AC. Sleep happily, okay? Com e. Don't hang up! Don't hang up! Hey Manoharan... You should go to the airport early in the morning. The youngest son is coming in the Dubai flight. Pick him up. You know the flight number, rig ht? Yes. So who will be here? Podiyan will stay here. Won't you? Why not? I'll take care. I'm the son of a policeman who stood guard for so many dead bodies! That's all right. Don't get drunk, leave the door open & go. There are foxes here. Aunty won't be here in the morning then. I'll sit next to aunty. - See you. And yeah... Don't go. Buy a bottle and come. If you can, you also come and sit with me. - Let's see. Are you leaving? "My mommy's dangling earrings" (film song) "My mommy's dangling earrings" (film song) "Earrings" - Hey! Come here. 2 diamond earrings. One gold necklace. A golden rosary and a watch. 3 bangles. Not 3 bangles. There's just one. - Just one? All those should be there on her body even whenl come back. What is this, bro? Don't you trust me? No, Podiyan. I don't trust you. "His mommy's dangling earrings", it seems. This is so bad. If something like this happens once... then no one would trust us. Do you want see your mom, or go to your sister's place? I want to go see mom first. Over there. Jomon? - Yes. Com e. This way. Hey! Come on. Mom! Looks like I'm being fooled. Hey Dixon Lopez! If my salary isn't credited to my account tomorrow, I'll get another company to bury your body! You heard me? What is it? I can hear someone crying from the house? What is happening? Oops! You heard it here? It's nothing, sister. Aunty's son has come from Dubai. When he saw the body, he cried. That's all. Body? Whose body? Aunty's body is inside. Her youngest son came from Dubai. He cried seeing the body. Natural. - How can you keep a body here? Then? Can I keep it there instead? Shall I keep it there? Oh no! Hey Shiva! This hag thinks that she won't die. Hey man! What's happening? Who is he? What's happening? - What? Have you kept a body inside the house? Well.. I didn't murder anyone and bring the body here. I brought her here upon her children's request. - How can we believe that? Let me tell you one thing. It's against the law. You can't keep a dead body here. Take it to a mortuary. {mm}? a Who are you? - I'm your bloody neighbour, man! Neighbour? That's fine. - Hey Podiyan! Huh? - Come here. Come here. - Come here, I say. Why? What's the problem? Him & his mother are creating a huge scene because we've kept the body here. Him? - Yes. Where is he from? - India. -Wait. Hey! How does he know that we've kept a body in here? -I don't know. I told him, bro. - What is this, man? Hey man! This is a unique situation. Because, that lady passed away... Her children are all in different pans of the world. We can take her out, only after they come. So what? I don't give a f### a IE Hey man! After all, it's a dead body. She won't trouble anyone. She's sleeping peacefully. Please! - No way! Take it away. - Didn't I tell you? He's a rascal. Go! Okay! Okay, relax. Owner of the dead body is coming. Okay? We'll talk. Okay? Bro, there's a huge problem here. There's a problem here. - What problem? Saying that we've kept a body here.. I think it's that Tamilian's son... He's creating a big fuss! I wanted to punch him in his gut, but I let it go thinking about you. How did they know that there's a body here? How did they know that? My dear Sindhukumar, didn't I tell you that those Tamilians are troublemakers? So? People can't die here or what? Owner! Owner? - Owner of the body. Hi. Rajuchetta, you leave. I'll deal this. What, Sharavanan? Hey! I'm not Sharavanan. I'm Shiva. - Shiva, then! Come. Come here. You idiot! - Yes. Why did you tell them that there's a body inside? Bro... When they asked me why someone is crying here, I told them about aunty! What else can I say? - What? What else can I say? Why do you have to slap me for such a small thing? Hey! I shouldn't have told them, right? Yo u... - Raj u Chettaa... Nothing will work out. That rascal is furious. What do we do now? - How do I know? Bro, don't you know any other house? - Me? For this? Go ask someone else! There's one place. Where? - Which place? There's only one place. Hey! What happened, man? The immediate neighbour of that house... A Tamilian rascal... He said that he'll complain to the council & police. So? We're searching for another place. But it will take time till the night to get it ready. Until then, you should adjust this here. Please. Shall we take it inside? Please. Hey! Take it inside. Take it inside, Podiyan. Harry, come on! Don't tell the neighbours. Lift the box! Tell me. Dude... Did you know? Emmy I'll deal with the Tamilian. That's better. Or else, I'll take this box to your house in the night. That won't be necessary. Good for you then! This is nothing! I don't even have a house to keep my own dead body. That's my situation now! Go inside, Jomon. I'll bring the luggage. Billy of Croydon? Have you heard of him? No, sir. Harry from Briston? No, sir. Sang karane of East Ham? Or even our Malayali boy, Kattappana Bobby? Who are these people, sir? They are the underworld princes who rule London. When they are all in my pocket, this bloody Tamilian... I'm going to rip him apart! What? What, man? I am Dixon Lopez. So what? Just for 2 days... Give us permission to keep that body in that house. No way! Don't say no! - No way! Is that so? Please. Please! Please, please! My sweet-heart! Come on! Come on! - Yes boss. I thought you would turn violent, sir. During certain special circumstances, we have to change our style. Why did you settle it by paying Pounds to him, sir? Only both of us need to know that I paid him money, okay? Raju.. - What's the status? Bring the item back to this house. How did you deal with him? How did I deal with him? Bring back the stuff, man! He must have paid money! And he claims to have dealt with him! Hello! Philip sir? - Yes. We're about to reach Terminal 3. Hello sir. Welcome. - Thank you. I've just landed. No. I'm staying at my sister's place. What do I say? We're constructing a shopping mall at Kottayam, right? I've been pumping all my money there. It's a 100 Crore project! His family hasn't come. This is aunty's eldest son. Philip. Astingy fellow! More than you? "As death approaches, please sit by my side for a while" Benny... Hey! You!! Who takes salary for the driver's post from the company? You or me? His flight was today? I thought it was tomorrow. Go get his luggage and keep it in here. You're becoming quite violent. How do I open this? I'll show you how to open.. - No. I've opened it. Careful. Brother" - Yes? How many children does this aunty have, altogether? Six.. No.. Five! Come here, man! - Coming. He doesn't know even that. - Counting her, five. Lara, be a nice girl, okay? Chechi... Mom! You left without saying even a word to me, mom! Ammini... She has been crying from Canada. Take me also along. I'll also come with you! Someone open it. Let me see her. - Chechi, come here. Chechi, come. If you go on like this, I'll also break down. We don't normally deal with Malayali families. They are always stingy when it comes to billing. It's very difficult to handle, you know? Difficult, it seems. Negotiation! But anyone would try out a negotiation, right? My dear sir, all of us want to make it grand. It shouldn't lack anything! Everyone compares Pounds with Indian currency. That's where the problem lies. He'll tap on to their sentiments. This will be intense. They are your only parents. Just the only ones? You're spending a little money for them, for the last time. No one remembers that. He's looking at you! Okay. What's our final bill now? Jessie, what's the total figure? Sir, final amount is 15,967. Is it too less? Just 15,967 Pounds. Wow'! If you quote such a huge amount, anyone would question it. My dear sir, since this is a case that came from Doctor, we arrived at this rate, after applying the maximum discount. Decision is yours. Okay. Do you need some advance now? 10,000 Pounds. Oh. That's all? Rest, you can pay on the funeral day morning. Is that so? Ammini... That's Ammini. That short one's wife. Me and Anto are so broke that we can't even contribute to it, mom! She's crying for that? Don't be upset. Mom can understand all that. Poor thing, right? Mukundan, give him a cheque. Me and Benny will transfer the amount to your account. He passed it on to his brother in law. Of course! Okay. - Jessie, give me the agreement. Doctor, you should sign this agreement yourself. Yeah. 10,000 Pounds, right? Yeah. - Sure. We need at least 5 priests. Mom was really fond of priests and brass band sets. Pm? Sign this one as well. - Okay. Monichaya... - Yes. This is not right. We should bury mom at our home town. At our home town? That won't be possible. - We should. That was her last wish. Next to dad's grave. She had told me. Just because mom said so. Are you the one who decides this all alone? You don't need to take any trouble. I'll take her myself. For that, what the hell do you have with you? He had to beg someone even for the ticket money from Dubai. Jomon, us elder sons are here to take decisions. Ammini and Kunjumol also. You don't have to be all hyper! I'm telling you what mom's wish was. Kunjumol knows it. She had promised mom. We make many promises to kids and old people. That doesn't matter. Is this like the lousy Church in Kattappana? Mom is going to get a royal funeral here in London. She will only be happy about it. Jomon, we've already signed the agreement. And we've paid the advance as well. How can we rethink now? What rethinking? We've paid 10,000 Pounds already. Who paid? - Well... Whoever paid it, money is money! You're all bothered only about money. Yes. We made that money by studying well, and working hard on our jobs. We didn't waste our time to end up penniless like you. We got it because of God's blessings. Will there be a fight? And he wants to take the body to Kattappana! You better stay quiet! Or else, I'll knock your teeth out! No. Everyone has reached. It will take 2-3 days. No. The funeral service guys are doing everything. Yeah. I'll call you back. No. It's okay. - Nice, rig ht? Who? - She is the doctor's wife. What is this, man? Being culture less in a house where a death has happened. I didn't know that you became decent. I had given it onthe newspaper. Didn't you read it? That's why I didn't know. That's why. Podiyan, boss is calling you. Jessie, I've told you several times not to call me Podiyan. My name is Sindhukumar. Sheesh! Chindukumar! Jessie, you can call him Podiyan. Or he has a nickname from Aalthara junction. Shall I tell her that? Please don't say that alone. - Get lost, Podiyan! He wants to call my nickname! Yeah. It's all right. I'll call you. Okay. Sure. Hi. Hello. Did aunty have such a wish? To get buried in her home town, as Jomon said? What's the point now? That's not going to happen. Did she say so to you as well? Yes. Excuse me. Ram. - Kunchayan... What's happening? - Where are you? I've come to our Maringattupalli party office. A small issue. I've come to compromise that. Where are you? I've come for a funeral discussion. A Malayali family. They are from your mother's home town. Where? From Kattappana? Yes. Who is the one who died? Is it someone I know? It's an aunty. Rosamma. Her children are all abroad. The youngest boy wants to get her buried back home, and the elder ones are against it. Do you know their family name? I don't know all that. The aunty's name is Rosamma John Chacko. Is her eldest son's name Philip? The one in America? Yes. The second son is in Australia. Oh! It's Rosamma Chedathi. I heard from someone that she had gone to her younger daughter's place in London. A mm? John Achayan was such a great man. Even Chedathi... The first two sons are building a shopping complex in Kottayam now. I heard that it's a 100 crore project. Jomon! Jomon! Stop there. Listen to me, dear. Kunjumol, you keep quiet. I can't stay with those two in the same house. Kunjachaya, the younger one and his sister are fighting. Shall I hang up? I'll call you later. Okay. So sad. What is happening here, man? It's my house, right? Shall you do me a favour? - Yes. Can I get a room in some hotel here? Just for 2-3 days. I need a cheap room. Jomon! Can you do it? You can get a room. In this situation, should you fight and leave? If you can help me, say that. I don't know anyone here. Okay. I'll arrange it. Such difference of opinions would be there in every house. You must close your eyes to some of them. I didn't say that they should accept my opinion, right? This was mom's last wish. Even after knowing that, they are... They have money. So it's only their decision that would happen, right? I know that. But I also can do certain things. There's some land that dad had written in my name, at Kattappana town. I get calls daily asking if I'm selling it. If I make one call to Kerala, money will come to any account I tell them. If you help me, I can go to our home town with my mom. Money is not the only issue, Jomon. Now, your mom is under our company's protection. We can't give her to anyone other than the person who signed the agreement. What if things happen as you and your mom wished? Let's try. Don't sell off your property in haste. M mm But he won't give it. Thank you so much, bro. I have to get some money from a chit fund. Once I get that, I'll return this 2000, along with the earlier 1.5. I just need the time to get there from here. I am standing guard for a dead body here. What do I say! It's a long story. Don't leave, okay? I'll reach soon, okay? Hey! Where are you going? Bro, I need to go to Maidstone. I have arranged some cash there. I need to collect it. There are people left in London who still lend money to you? Bro, I do return all that, right? Maximum 3 hours. Until then if you could stay here, I'd be really grateful. Don't take longer than 3 hours. - No. My bag is in the car. Bring it. Couldn't you bring it when you came? - Podiyan! I just have to bring the bag, right? I'll bring it. "There's water" "Where's the glass?" I've kept your bag here. Keep it and get lost. Don't drink the whole thing. I'll be back soon. Okay. Don't drink the whole thing? Who does he think he's talking to? Oops. Sorry! Hello! Cheers! It's so cold! So cold! Hello! I'm Raj u. Rajagopal. My full name is Rajagopalan Narayanan. I'm from Changanassery. Okay? I know your name, aunty. Rosamma. Rosamma John Chacko. You should have been lying in the drawing room of your house in Kattappana, receiving the prayers for the dead, and the divine mercy prayer. And you're lying in this filthy room, in this lousy house in Croydon? This is called 'Yogam' (luck), aunty! Didn't get me? In the language of Nairs of my town, it's 'Karayogam'. So what? Your children are throwing money to give you a grand funeral here. You need to be lucky enough for that too! Look here. Hello! I can't see you while sitting. Au nty ! Au nty ! Hey! I had metJomon. He really wants to get your funeral done at your home town. But poor thing... He doesn't have any money. And his elder brothers... He doesn't have the power to stand against them, as well. Once you're dead, how does it matter where you're buried? I am... lam going to call my wife. There might be some shouting and cursing. Please bear with it. "Oh God, I'm praying before you. Please bless me" Pick up! Pick up! It's ringing... It's ringing... Pick up! Where are my munchies? Pick up! She hung up! She has WhatsApp, right? Let me try WhatsApp. Yeah right! Sweet-heart, it seems! You idiot! What you're doing now, is a Himalayan blunder! I'll give you one last chance. You better let me back inside the house. Othen/vise, you will have to pay a huge price for this. Hey! I'm not so adamant about this. I can even come back home today evening if you want. Hello? A reply... I'm expecting a reply! Chocolate! The reply is here! Don't expect a reply. Oh! Don't expect a reply? Shouldn't I expect a reply? Okay. I'll try a different route. I'll see you soon. Asmall urination break. (singing an old song) Silence! Sound recording! Take 1. Rekha... Cut! Cut! Cut! My dear Rekha... Take 2. My dear Rekha... don't be such a stiff and rigid straight line... Shouldn't you bend and curve at times? Othen/vise, life would be so monotonous. We have only one life. And in that, who knows how long we're going to live. Have you read Kundera's book 'Unbearable lightness of being'? In that, he says... That means, 'When death comes...' Hey Podiyan! You idiot! No! Hey Podiyan! You idiot! No! No! Oh Christ! It's so damn cold in there. Hey Raw'.! What is it? Hey Raw'.! Why are you hiding behind the door? Come here. No! Come here, I say! A coat? Nice! Chocolate! Hey! I am calling you! Why are you staring like that? I got out of that box to sit and talk to you. What are you drinking? What is it? Whiskey! Whiskey! When it used to get really cold in Kattappana, my husband used to give me a little. It felt really good! Fix a drink for me. Hey kiddo! Fix a drink for me, man! Hey! The bottle is over there. Do you need water? It's Scotch, right? Don't pour water. Bring it here. Give it. Cheers! There's no one here. There's no one here. There's no one here!! Why does your face have a horrified expression, as if you've seen the devil? So you didn't die? I am dead. Then how are you walking around like this? I'll tell you. Hey! Death becomes complete... only after the Vigil for the deceased is received, the body is buried, and the grave is covered with sand. This resting posture before that... That's not in vain... I'm telling this since I'm fond of you. Don't tell anyone else. Even if you tell them, no one would believe you. That lying posture... ...is to understand! That posture is to understand everything that's happening around us. Truth and righteousness... Tears and false tears... The real and the fake... When I go to the Lord's court, he will ask me a question! 'Rosam ma' 'How was the world to you?' 'Family, husband, children' And depending upon the report that I give Him up there, the people down here would get punished or rewarded. Yeah right! I won't believe all this. Yeah right! I won't believe all this. For that, you haven't died yet, right? No. No dead person has spoken to you yet, right? Speak to me? I'll tell you something to make you believe me. What did your wife say? 'Don't expect a reply' Oh no! How did you hear that? Hey kiddo! - Yes. I was lying in that box, listening to everything! Your Milan Kundera is not necessary! For situations like this, Muttathu Varkey (Malayalam writer) is the best! Let that be. What was the problem? Well, aunty... Us men, for some comedy... Why? Women aren't allowed any comedy, or what? They are! Don't interrupt, aunty! Don't interrupt. I don't like that. No. You tell me. Well... That... How do I... Can I have a drink, please? Go ahead. What is this, man? This? The boys who come for work at Elakkanam are the ones who drink like this. Like how the cow drinks its gruel. It's for a confidence, aunty! Well... I'm not saying this because she's my wife. She is quite okay. When I failed in many businesses and went bankrupt, it was her, and her salary, that protected me. And that's when... I took something that was lying on a fence in East Ham, and kept it in an unwanted place, aunty! If you ask me why I did that... It's because of my loose character! Hey sweet-heart! Why are you sitting here like this? Aren't you going to the office? No. What happened? Do you have fever? I don't have fever. Come on! What happened? Nothing. I'm not going anywhere. That's all. Okay. Then take rest. [aim Raju.. - Yes. Thank you. Pen drive? What's in this? Listen to it in the car, on the way. Oh! Love songs? You'll know when you hear it. The scene is totally different today! I'll listen to it and call you. - Don't call. And never come back here. Hey! Rekha! Rekha? Rekha! Rekha? How long will we... How long will I romance this voice alone? When are you going to appear before this poor man's eyes? Let it be the right time. Well... What if you don't like me when you see me? Isn't it enough if we romance like this without seeing each other? My darling, I will die. You know how long it has been since I slept? I didn't sleep a wink last night. - Sheesh. You should close both the eyes. Isn't that how you should sleep, darling? It's all a joke for you, dear. And, what were you doing without sleeping last night? I read. Pablo Neruda's poem. I've read it several times. But yesterday, those lines acquired a new beauty. Have you heard them? - No. I'm not a litterateur or anything. Still, I made an attempt. I translated it into Malayalam. Really? - Yes. Do you want to hear it? - Yes. 'I will bring you happy flowers from the mountains, bluebells, dark hazels, and rustic baskets of kisses'. 'I want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees'. - It's very nice, Sachi. A Em its a - I was going to hang up. - Don't hang up. Give me a kiss before Rekha comes. - My husband is here. - Then shall I give you a kiss? Oh God! Rekha, this is a betrayal! Awell-planned betrayal! In Kerala, it's a called a honey-trap. Even a poor minister had been trapped in this. If she is your friend, she should have told that to me first. Should that cheat encourage me? Rekha! Open the door, please. Give me a chance to talk and apologize, falling at your feet, dear. I feel really weird. I need to go to the toilet. Open the door, please. Okay. I need to take my clothes. I need to take my clothes. I've packed it in a suitcase & kept it in your car's boot. Well planned! She trapped you nicely, huh? Laugh softly! Neighbours will hear you. The Tamilian there would be fast asleep now. He must be dreaming about the Pulisadam, that his mom used to make during his childhood. Whatever his dream might be! You're laughing hysterically hearing the story of a guy's life going for a toss? Whom were you flirting with, over the phone? Is she your wife's friend? Yes. - Is she good looking? I fell for her voice. If I had known that this was the case initially, I'd have escaped immediately. If a woman makes up her mind to ruin a man's life, it will happen. Even Rekha knows thatl already have quite a bad reputation in this. People say that you're rich in bad reputation! Aunty, are you with me, or the people? With you! - Then what is this? Hey! A mind that is ready to forgive, matters the most. If that's there... Family life is a business that can be run only if both of you have that. Hey! Do you know? A blunder that my husband made. It was when I had just delivered my youngest boy, Jomon. A distant relative of mine came for domestic help. Kochurani. She looks great! She came home and stayed with us. And that stay wasn't so simple. She pinned the edge of her dress to her hip, and started ruling the place. One day, when my husband went to the bathroom to take bath... she went behind him, with a handful of oil. Asking him, 'Pappachaya, don't you want to apply oil on your head?' What is it? What? 'It' must have happened! My husband came crying and told me everything that happened. I asked him only one thing. 'Would you carry her in your heart?' When he said no... I trusted him. And he never broke that trust. That's what I was saying... That there should be forgiveness. It's because you are in this form... Otherwise, I'd have put you in my car and taken you home, and made you narrate this Kochurani story to my wife. Aunty, can you talk to her on the phone? Hey Raw'.! If an old hag calls her and talks to her at this midnight hour, wouldn't that be an even bigger problem? Everything will be all rig ht, son. Just that it will take a few days. I really hope so. You should listen to my complaint. Complaint of the dead! Tell me! At the cemetery of our Church in Kattappana, right next to the grave where my husband rests" My only desire was to rest there. And my children are plotting against it now. Have you seen the cemeteries here? You know how awesome they are? If you see them, anyone would feel like dying once. They are so beautiful. Hey! Receiving the Vigil for the deceased in Malayalam, That too, should be done by Father Kanavasshery... Where my husband rests... In the soil that he became a pan of... To rest there is like... Isn't that the only place where I would be at peace? Au nty ! If I lie here amidst these foreign Sahebs and Madams... I will only be crying in pain. How do we do it, aunty? It will happen only according to your children's decisions, right? That decision should change. I want to go to Kattappana. Well... If you were alive, I'd have bought a ticket for you. There are tickets for the dead too, right? You will be able to buy it. My dear son... To take someone who forgot their way home, back to their house... Won't you be kind-hearted enough to do that? Consider that I am your mother. Whom do I tell this to, aunty? To Lopez, who's happy that he got a great business offer? Or to your children, who want to make this function grand? My dear Rajagopalan... Away would open up before you. I'm sure. Aunty, you're asking help to an orphan, who was chased away from his own house, by his wife and Pablo Neruda? If you support me to get this done... I swear on Pareppalli Church! There will be a solution to your issue as well. How? Tell me a way! Tell me a way! You should go there somehow, and kneel down before her, with folded hands. I've knelt down, with folded hands. Then you should cry really loudly! What is this? This sounds like a fox howling. Cry sincerely. I'll cry over there. I'll cry really loudly. She should accept whateverl say. Then she would kick you with her knee! Like this! Rekha! No! No! Who is it? Bro! What are you doing? Podiyan? When did you come? - I just came. Hey! Who all are here now? You, me and this aunty. What's the matter? Aunty was here all this while. I was talking to her. What? You finished the whole bottle? If you drink one full bottle, not just this aunty, you'd feel like you've talked to the aunty's mom as well. Stop it. Just get up. Get up! Hey! Go to sleep. Here's your key. Hold it. I swear! Aunty was talking to me. With aunty? -Yes. You talked? I believed it. So as we said, okay? Young girls don't talk to us! And you're saying that aunty spoke to you! What is all this, aunty? If you support me to get this done... I swear on Pareppalli Church! There will be a solution to your issue as well. Rekha! Good morning! Hey! That aunty's husband, Mr. John Chacko... He wasn't just speaking on the phone with another woman. He got the full action done! Look at me. Realizing that it was Kochurani's initiative, that aunty understood that the poor man made a mistake, and forgave him. Rekha! Rekha! Please! Please! Rekha, please! Please! A mind to forgive each other. A business that can be run only if both the parties have that. That's family life. This was said by experienced people. Please, dear. Open the door, please. Please, dear. Open the door. Come on! Let us talk! Come on! You traitor, who got your own husband into a honey trap! You know what should be done with you? Even in the international court of Feminists, this case of mine would get a bail. Later they will acquit me as well. Domestic violence. One phone call is enough. The police will reach here. Want to go to jail? You want to go to jail? No. Then get going- I'm going. Just one thing. Soon, my dead body will reach here. So, take it back to my Kerala... I don't need the 'Aivar Madham' cremation services and all that. You should have the heart to cremate me somewhere back in my home town. Okay. I'll do that. Pablo Neruda's bloody @%@% Hey! I went to meet Rekha and made an attempt. That didn't work out. Now I'm going for your matter. I need to catch hold of Kunjumol's husband, that Nair from Palakkad. You should stand with me, okay? Doctor? - Yes. Oh my God! Shall I sit here? Yeah. Please sit. - Thank you. I don't think you recognized me. I am Raju. Rajagopalan Nair. From Dixon Lopez funeral service? - Yes! Yes! I couldn't identify suddenly.. What's happening with the funeral preparations? We're planning it all very well. We're trying for day after tomorrow We need to get a couple of permissions. - That's good. Your home town is in Palakkad, right? Yes. A small village. It's called Nenmara. Nenmara. I've come there. Vall... Vallangy Vela" - Yes. I have some friends in Palakkad. - Oh Okay. Doctor" Or leave it... Well, doctor, do you... What is it? Tell me. Doctor, do you believe in spirits? Swim? Spirit. Our soul. Do you believe in it? - Of course, yes. Definitely. Well, us people from the Nair community have certain beliefs and traditions. I asked that because you needn't believe in all that. No. I believe them. I am a believer. In my ancestral house, Wu Em My maternal house is in.. This Pazhoor Padippura? Yes. - Have you heard of it? Of course. - It's a little to the south from there. You know, even our family has a lot of faith in astrology. We consult them regularly. So what I was about to say... I can say that confidently. - Yes. Tell me. My uncle... Em E So I just randomly discussed this death that happened at your house, and the present situation there, with my uncle. Don't feel bad when I ask this. - Ybs? Are you from the Ezhava caste, doctor? Sheesh. I am a Nair. My uncle told me. That's the only possibility. So I'll confidently say what my uncle told me. Tell me, please. One thing that he told was that... What is it? Tell me. Elm Did she have any last wish? Had she told anyone to take her body to her home town to get it buried there? Yes! She had a last wish. She had actually told that to my wife, Mrs. Mercy. Then I'll tell you the rest of what my uncle told me. Tell me, Rajagopal. This is a belief among us Hindus. I don't know if it would be acceptable to Christians. If this wish of hers doesn't happen, that soul wouldn't attain salvation. That soul will constantly create different kinds of troubles in that house. I see. It will specially affect the husband and kids. You know... What we can do... Its logic or its scientific basis... Or even it's applicability... I don't know all that. -Yeah. MERE mm Fortunately, it might be God's wish, that I saw you in here. You know, Mr. Rajagopal, the problem is... I'm not the one who should decide that. I am only the son in law. Apart from supporting what her children say... All that's correct. But why do you have to deliberately do something, that would bring harm to you and your children, doctor? Right you are. - Why don't you talk to your mom? Mom had actually told me this. That this should be handled very carefully. Mothers are like that. They will speak only for the well being of their children. Anyway, I was able to say this to you, right? Okay, Docmr. I'm getting down at the next station. I'm also getting down there. You're getting down here? Okay. If you need anything, just call me, Doctor. I'll get down and call my mother. I'll give you my number. Whatever you need, just call me. There's a talk in Kerala that us Nairs don't care for each other. - Oh no! We should change that. - Of course. Oh Lord Vigneshwara! Bless us. It's the moon sign. It can be harmful. Look. Unni is calling. Doctor! - Mr. Raj u! My car is over there. You know what's a coincidence? Whenl called home, our family astrologer was there. So he also said the same things that you said, Raju. He will, sir. Astrology is a science! It's a secret pride for us Hindus. Go straight home and tell your Christian brothers in law, to take their mom to Kattappana and bury here there. I'm going to say it right away. Call me once you tell them. - Sure. My number is 778739532. - 778739532. M! mum E No. 5321. - 5321. Okay. Okay. Thank you. - Okay. Thanks. Bye! Bye! Bye! - Bye! Move, you baldy! Where is this Jomon? No news from him. Elm This is why he's not doing well in life. Ammini, is the pork ready? Yes. Here. Don't shout, man! Your Cholesterol is so high, and you're thinking about pork all the time. Don't say that, Ammini. I think about pork only when I'm not thinking about you. Give it here. Well, brother... Do you get good buffalo meat in Sydney? Not as much as Canada. Oh! How come you're late today, Doctor? Shall I get you a drink? No! I don't drink during the day. If you're drinking, you should drink during the day. It keeps you going for the whole day, right bro? Hey Philip! I wanted to say something. What is it? Hey! It's a matter of belief. Matter of beef? No! It's a matter of belief. - Belief! Well, mom wanted to be buried at her home town, in case something happens to her while she's here, right? So if she departs without fulfilling that wish, I doubt whether her soul would attain salvation! Salvation? That's your Hindu concept, Mukundan. We don't follow that. It's not that. The death happened in my house, rig ht? So our family might have a bad effect, is what... ma; a Doctor, according to our belief, if we bury her at a Church cemetery after all the prayers, it's over. That's all. Even othen/vise, your Hindu set-up is quite bad! Burning a corpse, and immersing its ashes into a river? Sheesh! And if there's any harm, it would affect us children only, right? Us sons-in-law are safe, doctor! Well, I just said my opinion. Fix another drink. What Olavakkodan Nair is he? Not Olavakkodu. Isn't he from Nenmara? Right? I wanted to say something to you, Monichayan. Mattam Chackochayan's son Jijo had asked, if he could get somejob, in the shopping complex that you're building in Kottayam. Ammini, Benny and I had already decided, not to give jobs to relatives and family friends there. A professional group is going to manage it. We won't interfere in anything. Even in matters of the staff. Many people are calling me for this. I needn't accept their calls, right bro? No. - We've spent so much money, right? Moreover, who's worthy of being trusted, in our family? We also made a mistake like that. - Is that so? When? - Don't grin. He's talking about you. Well, Pork... - Huh? I mean, Ammini.. The pork hasn't been cooked fully. It will be cooked properly in your tummy! Oh! Digestion! Doctor Mukundanunni. Aunty, your Nair son-in-law. Oh my Gods of Perunna, I hope the Nair has won over all the Christians. Hello Doctor! No way, Rajagopal. They are not agreeing in any way. Its Eta And total ignorance about our Hinduism. What can we do? I can't fight against it. Okay. Thank you. It flopped! I played the caste card, knowing that it's a dirty game. In front the Central Travancore Achayans (Christians), the Palakkadan Nair is nothing! Why did you get her married to him? What's the point in blaming your son in law? Your children are the trouble makers. Mocking with your smile? Au nty ! It's my imagination, right? Had you smiled? "O. right? Yes, Raju Chetta. I'm outside. I'll come. That's okay. I'll reach. Okay. Jomon, nothing is going to work through straight channels. And your brother-in-law? Anto? From Canada? I'm going to meet him. After I meet him, he will call you. I'll tell you what you should tell him then. - Okay. Where are you in Changanasshery, Rajuchayan? I am from Mudukkummoodu. It's a place where you get great beef. I don't eat beef. What kind of a Catholic doesn't eat beef? Com e. My house is near Pareppalli. My uncle was the driver to the Archbishop of Perumthottam. The Archbishop is my mother's father's... No! No! Her first cousin! Its I didn't say what I came to say. Tell me. Along with that, order a beer as well. - That will come. Your wife's ancestral property in Kattappana... Whom does it belong to, in the will? My dear Rajuchaya, we were hoping that it will be written in Ammini's name. Did any of us think that the lady would die so soon? Though she said that she will get the will written, it's not officially on paper. Then it's officially on paper. IE E I had met Jomon. I got an indication that aunty had written in a will, that the house & property will go to him. How is that possible? Didn't I tell you? I just got a clue while talking to that boy. If that is correct, it will be trouble for you, dearAnto! Even though the person is dead, if it's written on a will, it's equal to a registration. What kind of a Catholic are you? Take me home as soon as possible. I need to tell this to my Ammini. Sit down. What are you going to do by running there? That won't solve this. Decide to go back to Kerala with aunty's body. Jomon is ready for it. Kunjumol will also come along. You go there, and search aunty's room or the attic or somewhere for such a paper... If you find it, just tear it off. Since they have decided that the funeral is here, how can we go to Kerala now? Dear Anto, what if Jomon goes to Kerala without waiting for the funeral? If he goes? - If he goes? What if he goes and this will reaches his hand? That will be trouble. - Yes. That will be trouble. My dearAnto, I'm saying this because we're from the same Parish. We already have a bad name that one Catholic cannot stand another one. We should change that. Shall I tell you a truth? As far as I've noticed, you're the only one with some honour and pedigree, in that family. Do it only if you want to. Drink! One more beer, please. What is this, man? If that's the case, we should go to Kerala, find that will that mom wrote &tear it off. So should we go to Kattappana? We should. You don't open your mouth. I'll deal this. Come. Hi lqbal.. That one acre of land behind our site... You should get it somehow. In future, if there are parking problems, that's the only way out. I'll pass the phone to Monichayan. It's Iqbal. What's happening there, man? Okay. No one else should know this. If they hear this, they will increase the price. Yes. We'll get it done, man. I'll call you later. Hey! Monichayan & Bennychayan shouldn't become upset when I say this. Why don't you say something that won't upset us? Bennychaya, it's not a joke. We should conduct mom's funeral at Kattappana. No one took it seriously when Jomon said that. I feel it should be done like that. Kunjumol, don't you have the same opinion? How come suddenly? We've made all the arrangements here, right? I'm feeling sad, ever since I came to know that mom had such a wish. Enough of this fake sentiments, Ammini. Anto, what's the problem? Say the truth. That's better, Am mini. Let's say the truth. They are not strangers, rig ht? You both had promised that... you'd give the house & property in Kattappana to me, right? Kunjumol doesn't have any objection in that as well. Who raised an objection now? No one said so. That's true. But a betrayal has happened. Mom wrote a will without informing anyone. Saying that the ancestral property belongs to Jomon. Who said that to you? There's a guy called Raju from the funeral company, right? Who's that? I know him. He spoke to Jomon and got to know about it slyly. This Raju is a Catholic from Changanasshery. He's a close relative of the Archbishop. If Jomon finds that will that mom wrote... Anto, just call him. The Father? - No. The son. Jomon! - What for? Call him. I'll tell you what you have to ask him. Hey baby. What the F is happening? - I have no idea. Jomon.. - Yes. It's Antochayan. - What is it, Achaya? You're doing good, right? Get to the point, man! Jomon, our ancestral property in Kattappana" -Yes. Do you have any idea about mom writing it in someone's name? She hasn't told me anything. - Is that so? Did you hear anything about mom writing a will, or writing that property in anyone's name? No. - No? Has she given any indication about giving that ancestral property to someone? The only thing that she told me, related to the property was that... Yes. Yes? Yes. Tell me. What did she say? When I went home last time, mom had said that she would like to see me married, and staying in our ancestral home with kids. Did she say that? - Yes. She did. What is it, Achaya? - You hang up then, dear. I'll call you later. I am sure. If mom had said that, consider it gone! Dad had written 2 acres of land in Kattappana town, in his name, right? Then why does he need this as well? If mom has written such a will... It's equal to a registration. Kunjumol, get the suitcase that mom brought from home. If this is true, the stamp paper would be in there. Yes. Let's check that. Move, Kunjumol. Open it. Shucks! Dad! In between all this! There's nothing in here. Then it will definitely be there at our Kattappana house. Ammini &I are going to Kattappana today itself. You needn't go there. If it's there, we can find out. Why don't we call Mathukkutty? Care-taker Mathukkutty? If he finds it... You keep quiet. - You come with me. Did mom come here with only one suitcase? Yes. - Hey'. Come. Why are they conducting aunty's funeral in London? For their convenience. That's really sad. It is because of that Philip's stubbornness. It's not stubbornness. It's his arrogance. It's Philip. That scoundrel will live a 100 years. Hello Philip Achaya... Math ukkutty... Where are you? I am at the plantation. I'm spraying pesticides on the cardamom plants. - Go home immediately. Give it to me. Call Advocate Sabu from Vazhakkala, when you go. And what should I do? You go there. Rest I'll call Sabu and tell him. Okay then. - Okay. Get me that box. What are you searching for, Sabu? You can ask that to Philip Achayan. Why? For him to swear at my mom? There's no other box? No. Aunty had only this cupboard. There are no other boxes. Shall I keep these back? - Yes. Shall I close it? Yes. Achaya, it's me, Sabu. There's no such document or will in aunty's box or cupboard. Not in her suitcase or her cupboard? No! Okay, Sabu. I'll call you. There's nothing there. What's the name of that funeral service guy? Dixon Lopez. - Not that. The guy with the slant. Slanted one is Raju. He was just playing a trick. He was the one who took Jomon from here, right? Yes. - It's a trick to get the funeral done at Kerala. What's his interest in this? He must have fallen for Jomon's sentiments. Why should he have the sentiments that her children don't have? There's another thing. I had called Jaison in Changanasshery. He said that there's no such Raju, related to the Archbishop. Benny... I think we must meet him then. Let everything happen as per the plan. {mm} Mm What is it, sir? - This guy? Your staff, Raju? Raju is not my staff. He's my partner. Partnership is between you. We needn't know all that. What a partner! He's indirectly trying to spoil a business that your agency received. What happened? He's doing some fraud operations along with our younger brother. See! We will decide where to conduct our mother's funeral. Yes, of course. Our younger brother Jomon said something foolish. And this guy is behind him, to help him out. We don't understand what the hell his interest in this matter is! He's spreading lies about a fake will, to make us fight between ourselves. He even lied that he's a Catholic. This Nair! I don't understand what you're trying to say. But just tell me what you want. I'll arrange that. Nothing. He shouldn't interfere in anything, until this funeral ceremony is over. Othen/vise, we will have to approach another agency. We'll forget about the money we paid! W? Emits No. Nothing of that son would be necessary. Raju won't be pan of the scene hereafter. I can promise that. That's good. Forus" And your firm, as well. Harry" Yes, sir. Last one. Thank you. - You're welcome. Okay, Philip sir. - Bye. It's not your mom who died, right? Then what the hell... Didn't a mother give birth to you? - I won't be born othenwise, right? When I see people like you, I wonder whether you sprouted out yourself! Are you leaving? I'll come back, when it's time! Don't You do realize the struggles I'm going through, right? I tried out all the fraud games I know. But nothing is working out, aunty. I'm scared whetherl would fail. Please forgive me, if that's how this is going to end. When the death is not your own... By own, I mean when it's not your near and dear ones who have died... I've always felt that there's a cenainjoy generated in humans. A relief that the loss is not for himself. Isn't that true, aunty? Haven't you seen people rushing to houses where a death has occurred? You know how excited they are to fake grief, and start their philosophy? But no one really goes to a house where a wedding happens, where everyone is happy. No one takes initiative to go there. They didn't come home and invite.. They left the invitation at the door-step... There are a hundred complaints! This how people are, aunty! But why aren't your own children able to understand what their mother wants? Don't they realize that they also have to lie like this one day, and their bodies which were the proof of being alive, should be part of the earth someday? My mother left this earth, when she was almost as old as you. She had many desires. Many sights she wished to see! Many words she was waiting to hear! That poor thing didn't get any of that. That debt which I couldn't repay... I thought I would repay it, through you, Rosamma aunty! But... Well.. Kunjachayan is calling. Let me attend it and come. Yeah! Au nty ! You made Kunjachayan call me, right? Wait & watch! This will work! This will work! Hey! Drive to the municipal office. I have to go there. Namaste sir. Sit down. Soman, is Balachandran inside? - Yes, sir. Come with me. Balachandran! Thomas sir? Then what? - Please sit, sir. You also sit. How have you been? Going on like that... And Balachand ran, I need a favour from you. From me? Yes. - Tell me. That is.. Hey Philip! Both of you step outside and close that door. Make it fast. Isn't all that okay? - Yes sir. How come people from the municipality are coming in the morning? They had come for an inspection even last week. Why have they come again? Biju... What is it, sir? Suddenly? What's the matter, sir? - I don't know. You didn't say what the matter is, sir. - Hey! This damn thing was built up on a marsh land, by paying bribes to Sp many people, right? If this building falls down tomorrow, you know who would end up with sand in their mouth? This is to avoid that. And, the piling is not at all proper. - Piling is proper, sir. It had gone through many inspections. The officers before you had checked. Don't narrate those stories to me. Philip, who's in America, owns this, right? - Yes sir. Philip sir, and his brother who's in Australia. Ask them both to come. I'll submit this report to the municipality in 2 days. If he comes, it will be good for Philip. He knows me. Tell him that I'm MR Ramachand ran, who studied in Kothamangalam MA Engineering college with him. He would know me. Sir, Philip sir & his brothers are in London. Their mom died over there. All that's correct. If they don't come here immediately, around a 100 crore Rupees would drown in this marsh. Got it? - Sir, that... Bring it here. Pen... What is this, sir? - Stop memo. Sir.. - It's a stop memo, to stop the construction work. Sir, that.. - All of you, get into the car. Susheelan, start the car. Sir! Sir! Let me talk.. - Move away. Shall we leave? It's Iqbal. Monichayan, put it on speaker mode. I need to say something to Iqbal. What's happening? The funds must have reached the account, right? It's not that, sir. There was another problem. You always have some problem. What is it, now? Tell me. Benny is with me. Sir, an engineer had come from the municipality to inspect the site. He was really furious. He gave us a stop memo. We will have to stop the work. Stop the work? - But what's the problem there? Sir, he said that there's some problem in the piling. The building is slanted, it seems. He'll submit the report to the municipality in 2 days. He said we might have to demolish it mostly. Sir, you should find some solution. What solution can we find while we're in London? Stuff whatever he needs, into his mouth. It's his trick to get money. No, sir. He won't take a single penny. He's really strict. He said that he knows you, Philip sir. He said that he was with you while you studied at Kothamangalam Engineering college. What's his name? - Balachandran. He was in the civil branch. Do you remember him? Oh! That guy from Thrisshur! Is it him? Yes. - He was troublesome even then. Sir, it would be better if you both could come down quickly. He said that as well. What if we come? - If you come here, we can meet him in person... That's not necessary. That's all his ego. Wait, Iqbal. Let me see what I can operate without coming there. Okay sir. - Then what! See how easily he's asking us to demolish the building! His damn piling! We should be trying to make him stop saying that. What do we do now, Monichaya? Let me try calling the MP, Jose. If you have to convince engineer Balachandran, you must come here with Benny, Philip Chettan. I'll arrange a meeting. What say? Jose, it's our mother's funeral day after tomorrow. The necessity is ours. And we don't have time as well. Things would depend upon the report that he's preparing. So you're saying that we must definitely come there? Yes. If you come, it would take hardly two hours. I'll talk to him and arrive at a compromise. These Government officers have this... You know, right? Let's just show him some respect, and get our things done. Okay. Let me consult with Benny. - Okay. Isn't that enough, Kunjachaya? More than enough! Monichaya, there are 2 tickets available to Kochi, at 12.30 PM day after. Shall I buy them? - Buy it! So if you both are going to Kerala day after, why don't we conduct the funeral there? Now you'll be in Kerala, and the funeral will be here. If someone asks where her elder sons are? Will you return the money we paid as advance here? I didn't pay it. Those who paid should get it back. Then what? - Will he return it? Let's try asking him. - We should ask him. Yes! Dixon Lopez! Dixon Lopez, this is me, Benny. Benny! What a girl, man! Benny! Benny! Our mother's funeral case... Hello... Sir.. Benny... Benny sir! Tell me. - There has been a slight change in our programme. Oh no! What? Everything is set for day after. I'll pass the phone to my elder brother. Okay. Dixon... We've arrived at a decision to take mom's body to Kerala and bury it there. Oh no! Why such a change in plan? There's an emergency situation, for which we have to reach Kerala immediately. That's why. We called you... I'll pass the phone to Benny. Okay. Well, the 10,000 Pounds we paid as advance... Come here, girl! Yes. The advance? - You will return it, right? When can we expect it? To return it? I'll release the body only if you hand over the balance amount as well, to me. What nonsense are you saying? My dear sir, my words and actions are all like that. Or else, your Doctor brother-in-law... The one who signed an agreement with my company! He will be trapped! He has a good reputation, right? Why do you want to send the poor man to the court? So you won't return it? - Not like that. I'll return the body. After I get the entire balance amount that I'm supposed to receive. Then you can take the body, bury it or play with it, or do whatever you want! Okay then! He is trying to teach prayers to the Pope. Who is it? - You don't have to know that. Come here. Come on, dance! That rascal is not going to return the money he has taken. He won't return the body unless we pay the balance too. What do we do? The stuff is with him, right? This is all because of your wife was adamant. 'Don't keep it in a mortuary. Keep it somewhere else!' Did you realize how difficult it is to tolerate your sister now? - Shut up! When I'm going crazy here... Benny, shall we bury it here itself? That's what. We spent a lot of money here. And if we have to bury her in Kerala, it will cost that much more. Hey! You're leaving by noon day after, right? Let's have the funeral in the morning. So you can attend it and go. Right, bro? - Do one thing. You call him. - Yes. Call him. Call him. Not like that. Like this" Like this! One second, honey. Yes, Dixon Lopez. It's Philip. Tell me, sir. We should conduct the funeral here itself, as per the plan. Okay. - That too, day after morning between 9 & 9.30 AM. Me and my brother have a flight to Kerala at 12.30 PM. Day after tomorrow morning. Okay. When I come there tomorrow morning, keep the cheque for the balance amount ready. I need to make a lot of payments. What is it? What happened? A mp? Boss, Manoharan was on duty there. He went out somewhere for a couple of hours. When he went back, our freezer with the aunty was missing. It was worth 15,000 Pounds. Do you guys have any responsibility, you donkeys? Raju bro had a spare key with him. Then it must be him. Are you able to reach his phone? - No. It's switched off. We should find him. That item is supposed to be buried tomorrow morning. Wherever it is, go find it, man! This is such a cruel play of fate, oh God! What's happening? - It's a dead body, Ma'am. Dead body? Whose? - Rajagopal sir... What? - It's nof mine. It's nof mine. What is this, Raju? I'll tell you. Tell me what this is! I'll tell you! - Raju! Raj u! Raju, stop there. I'll explain everything in detail. Before that, we need to keep that freezer inside our house. It's a dead body. Whose is it? I'll tell you. Whatever the problems between us might be, I need a space inside this house now. To preserve the mother who's in that box. - What nonsense are you saying, Raju? Jomon! It's his mother. He is going to take her to Kerala and give her a funeral. I am helping him. You need to understand only that much now, Rekha. Jomon, you can go. Rest we'll do as we planned. Okay? Reach there and call me. Guna, keep the box inside. Rekha! If that boy's brothers know this, won't there be legal issues? Will Dixon stay calm if he knows this? There would be many problems. I'm not thinking about all that now. I took a decision. I have a belief that it would happen. Rig ht, aunty? That's all I know. You'll be with me, rig ht? Or? Will you fight with me for Pablo Neruda's poem and Paulo Coelho's novel? You should be killed. Bloody rascal! Aunty is watching! Who is it? It's Dixon. - Dixon Lopez? Rekha, you should deal this. Anyway, I've been wanting to deal with him. He's a scoundrel who's spreading rumours all over the world that we've divorced. I'll show you now. What is it, Dixon? - Where is Raju? Don't you know that Raju doesn't stay here now? I know that. It's not that... Did Raju bring some box" I mean a big box... There are no boxes here. Well, a box is missing from the office. I was wondering if it would be here... You and your box! If you come here ever again asking all this, I'll call the police. - Oh no! Sister! Sister, while I was just passing by... Didn't I tell you that it won't be here? Good night. - Get lost! Boss, what do we do now? Let the sun rise. We will go and meet those idiots. Follow me. - Yes boss. That funeral director... Monichaya... He has come with some bad news. What happened? It's not our mistake. The problem is because you said you can't keep the body in the mortuary. We need a legal paper from the authority. Saying that the body was kept in the mortuary since the time of death. We need to give that paper to the Church. Well.. But now? We'll get the paper. Talks are on, for that. But time is the problem. It won't happen today morning anyway. Then? Our flight is at 12.30 PM. Considering the present condition, however much we try, the programme will happen only by 4 - 4.30 PM. Let's leave. Let them conduct the funeral. What else can we do? We can't miss the flight. Okay. Doctor sir, what about the rest of the payment? Well, the rest of the payment... mg M! ERA ERA Yes. Okay. Raju, what you did was really shady. I did what had to be done to a shady guy. That's true! Where is the body? We have to bury it today evening. - Dixon! Once a person is dead, people would even forget the person's name. After that it's just a corpse, a dead body. In your language - item, stuff! Did you recognize him? Its Didn't you call it a body? For him, it's his dead mother who passed away. She had a wish that her body should be buried in her home town. That wish is going to happen. or, I'm going to make it happen. You don't have a difference of opinion in it, right? My dear Raju, we've taken the full payment. Since you've taken the full payment, you don't have anything to lose, right? If you ask so... That means, you don't have any objection to take her body to Kerala, right? But what do we tell the people who paid the money? - Leave that. They both will leave in the morning flight itself. In an available afternoon flight, Jomon will leave with aunty. Let him go. - You should bear the expenses for it. Me? Why? You should bear that expense from the 15,000 Pounds you got for free. That's such rubbish! Dixon, no more dialogues. I will talk. You should listen. Leave my hand, Raw. It's paining. Leave my hand. I agree! L agree! Okay, Kunjumol. Bye. Bye. Leave happily. I'm here for everything. That's our only tension. Poor guys are leaving, just because I'm here to support. Monichayan and Bennychan just left. You just missed them. I was waiting for them to leave. No! Wait up for me! Jomon... What's the status of the funeral? Everything is set. We will bury her at 4 PM, at the Church here. If it's about burying our mom, that won't happen. Huh? - Jomon... What are you saying? Mom is not in Dixon Lopez's rented house anymore. Then? - Mom is at a place I know. I'll go home in an afternoon flight with mom. What are you saying, boy? Rajuchetta" Here. Come here. Jomon is not lying. It's him. That Nair. You can see your mom resting behind me, right? According to your mom's wish... According to Jomon's wish... They are leaving today. Mother and son. Doctor Mukundanunni, if you and your wife don't have any objection, you can join them on that journey. At her birth-place, in a land that she knows... near the grave where her husband became part of the soil, a poor soul's wish or a desire to rest there... That is going to happen now. Jomon... You should talk to Anto and Ammini. Okay? Give it. Okay Chetta. This is the will that Antochayan &Ammini Chechi are looking for. A will in which mom wrote the ancestral property in my name. Read it and see. Last time when I went home, I accepted this only because mom forced me a lot. I never wished for this. But I know that Ammini Chechi has been longing for it. I'm only happy to give it to you, Ammini Chechi. I have only one question now. Are you coming with me? To attend our mother's funeral at our Church cemetery? We're also coming, Jomon. Me and Anto are also coming. Then what! The funeral will be in Kattappana! Enough with all the nonsense in London. Finally, it has happened! I can see a smile blooming inside. Did you smile? Or, is it just my thought or imagination? You're the one who made me think all this, right? I knowthatl can't say 'See you later'. We will be coming to Kattappana. To see you sleeping next to your Chachan (husband). Gosh! What happened? Is it because aunty has left? No. Well, what did the spring do with the cherry trees? I hope it doesn't do anything. Ku njachayan. - I'll kill you if you pick up. You and your Kunjachayan. Calling only at the wrong times. Hang up! What is this? - Just a minute. Hello Kunjachayan. - Yes. They have just left to the airport now. They will reach Nedumbasshery airport, day after morning. All arrangements have been made there. And I'm also going to Kattappana. I'll go back to Kottayam, only after the funeral. And yeah... Shall I ask you something? How in the world did you come up with that lie? Which lie? Since I lie quite a lot... That there's a problem in the piling of that building? What happened? - My dear, it actually has a problem. Engineer Balachandran told me. Problematic things shouldn't be built upon this earth, Kunjachayan. What has to be demolished, should be demolished. And, the fate of the money that her children have pumped in, would depend upon the report that aunty gives up there. Who has pumped in? Whoever has pumped it in, money is money right, Kunjachayan?
