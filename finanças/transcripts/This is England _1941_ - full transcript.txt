This is England, the very heart of England, where the winds of war blow across the hills and moorlands of Yorkshire and Derbyshire. They stir the grass in the sheep valleys of Cumberland and ruffle the clear surface of Ullswater. They sing in the cathedral towers of Durham, in the unfinished tower of Liverpool, in the spires of Coventry. In the shadow of the hills, lives a great industrial people. This is their land, these are their cities, England's Pittsburgh and Detroit. Here live the lusty people of England. In peacetime, they worked hard and played hard, enjoyed life in their own way and in their own time. A people of strong, able hands and warm hearts. And today, their hearts and their hands also are being put to the test as never before. In black Sheffield, the flames of the steel furnaces scorch the men's faces night and day. When the day's work is done, the men who make steel go out to protect their home from the fire that comes down out of the night sky. Here is George Goode, steelworker by day, air-raid warden at night. Well, Albert, I've had a rough shift today, but never mind, I've got a good dinner to go home to. After that, I'm going on ARP duty. From steel to cotton, from Yorkshire to Lancashire, all day long the looms are weaving cloth for export to pay for arms and food from over the Atlantic. But all night, men must stand on rooftops looking out over their homes and their factories, watching for fire bombs. Yes, there's two of us on every night, fire-watch party. Immediately the siren calls, we go on top. Of course, we keep our eyes scattered around, don't we? The man at the fire station has been training the youngsters to put out these incendiary bombs. They seem quite good at it. In fact, I've seen one about...that size, and she was very good at the job, too. This was once the playground of a school. Now it's one of the places where Liverpool trains her rescue squads. Behind this grim work, lie an infinite number of patient, everyday tasks for the women. Dull jobs, like typing lists of addresses. Unending jobs, like sorting clothes for the homeless. Voluntary work, no pay. And done by women, done with love and devotion. And the simplest, most difficult task of all, just staying put with the war around the corner. And when they were over the coast, we could hear the guns firing, and eventually one was hit and caught fire. It just seemed as though it was at the end of this street. And what a cheer went up, here, over at South Moor on our left, at Blackhouse on our right. But there were women who fainted, too. On a hazy day, Jerry comes droning over about three miles up. When the roof spotters think he means trouble, they send the mill girls down to shelters. You can see how these Lancashire girls cower before the mighty Luftwaffe These are the folk who were to be bombed into capitulation, terrorised into begging for peace. But in Manchester today, they still respect the genius of Germany, the Germany that was. These people you're meeting are just ordinary English folk, fighting for their homes. Listen to Mrs Hyde of Coventry... You know, you feel such fools, standing there in a crater, the pitch darkness of night and holding mugs of tea, you see the men bringing out bodies. You feel useless, until you know that there's someone there actually in that bombed house who's alive and you can give that tea to. And then to hear the praises of the men themselves, saying, "That tea's jolly good. "I've just washed the blood and dust out of my mouth." We feel that we really have clone the job, and a useful job. And even now in Yorkshire, the people find the time to sing. ♪ Hallelujah! Hallelujah! ♪ Hallelujah! Hallelujah! ♪ Hallelujah! ♪ For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth ♪ Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! ♪ For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth ♪ Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! ♪♪ People who sing like that in times like these cannot be beaten. Anger comes slowly to these people, but now, they and their mates, their wives and children are being subjected to a terrible ordeal. As they look at their battered and blasted homes and cities, they may remember the words of Wellington at Waterloo. "Heavy pounding, this, gentlemen. "We shall try who can pound the longest." For these people have the power to hit back. And they're going to hit back, with all the skill of their hands, the proud traditions of their craft and the fire in their hearts. These are the people who will answer the German challenge. And the Nazis will learn, once and for all, that no one with impunity troubles the heart of England. ♪ King of kings ♪ For ever and ever ♪ And lord of lords ♪ Hallelujah!
