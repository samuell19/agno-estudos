- You're the best at what you do. People respect and admire you. There's nothing that you're afraid of. Tough as nails. Tough as they come. You're invincible. And you're gonna die. Fuck you! Morning Nicole. - Morning. Any messages? - No, but there is a man waiting in your office. - And why is there a man waiting in my office? Didn't I say I didn't want to be disturbed today? - I know Felix, but this man showed up and he said he wasn't leaving without seeing you. Who is it? - Said he's your brother. - My brother? - That's what he said. - What the fuck?! Next time, if you could schedule a meeting with my receptionist instead of storming into my office, we can discuss whatever it is you need to discuss at that time. - This won't take long. - I'm trying to be as polite as possible. I don't see anybody without an appointment. - Max Kale sent me here personally. - I'm off that case. You tell him there's nothing more I can do. Now please go. - Well it seems that there is something you can do. Your old partner now DA Reese has come across some incriminating evidence that if it found it's way into court could put Mr. Kale away for a long time. - And? We'd like for you to get those documents before that happens. - What, so you're asking me to sabotage this case? - No, we're asking you to do a favor for an old client who's gone out of his way for you many times. - I can't do that. That's not what I'm about. - If you perform this service for Mr. Kale, then you'll be generously compensated. - Generously? And what do you consider generous? - You name it. Within reason of course. - 150,000. Cash. That's what I need. - Let's call it 100 and we're done. - It's 150 or I go across the street and share this conversation with Judge Cackston. - No you don't wanna do that. Besides, I thought we were just negotiating here? - No, there's nothing to negotiate. You want me to save his life, then you're gonna save mine. - Seems like I detect a little desperation in that voice of yours, but fine, 150 it is. The trial starts on Friday. That gives you two days to get these documents. Two days is your window. - That's a little short notice isn't it? - It's what you've gotta work with. Besides, it's not like we're asking you to kill Reese. - Hmmph, well that's a relief. Because for a moment there I thought maybe you mistook me for a fucking hit man. - Just get those documents and make sure they don't make it into that courtroom. - You said that, I'll handle it. - I'm sure you will. Because this is gonna save your life as you put it. Payment will be made when the documents are delivered. And you need to remember something Felix. We know everything about you down to the car that you drive. It's a one shot deal, no second chances friend. - Don't start barking threats at me whatever your name is. Not if you want my help. - My name's not important 'cause we're never gonna see each other again. I'm just a middle man here. Just don't, don't disappoint us. Yeah, give me Reese. Alright nevermind, I'll call him back. Hello. Ferris? You're where? Oh for Christ fucking sakes! - Wait no. Tell me why. - Look, this isn't for me. Okay I can't do it anymore. Let's not make this harder than it has to be alright? - I love you, does that not count for something? Hey, you called me and you told me that you're leaving. Now I'm here, talk to me. - Okay, we've had this conversation 20 different ways already. This is what I want, okay?! - This is not a one sided relationship Ayla. - Val, can you not see the writing on the wall? You and I, we are just not what we used to be okay?! I am through! I'm through! - So you just throw it all away and to hell with me?! - This has been a long time coming Val. - No, this is a complete fucking surprise actually! - You know what I got the rest of my stuff, your keys are by the TV! Wow, it's about time. I might've been dead if you took any longer. - You in need of a bond? Why else would I be here? Give me one second. Hey listen man, I ain't got a second. - Pal I've had a very rough morning and I don't need you pouring gasoline on the fire. Now give me one second. - You don't know what rough is. Uh, can we get this rolling? - Sure thing, what do ya need? - A bond for 10,000. - Who, what, and where? - It's my son Ferris, DUI county. - First offense? - Second. - 10 grand huh? Kinda high. - Yeah well, they wanna make an example out of him because of who I am. - Yeah I thought that was you. Aren't you that TV attorney who does those really horrible cheesy commercials? Ain't got it, those can be any worse. - Huh, yeah well those cheesy commercials bring in more in a month than you make in a year. Now should I take my business elsewhere? - Are you sure you don't want to bail your son out yourself? As you say, you make more money in a month than I do in a year. - Listen, I don't have to explain myself to you, but just to put it out there, this is a total embarrassment for me. And I'd rather not show my face down there for something like this. - Hey you walked into my office okay? I didn't walk into yours, just asking. - Well I'm not here to be interrogated. Alright, now I need him out today. - We can do that. Are you gonna show up for his court appearance or will he become a problem for me? - Nope, no problem at all. - Hey baby. Yeah, I just got home like five minutes ago. Zed picked me up. Mmm hmm, yeah my dad's on his way over right now but I want you to come over afterwards. Yeah. Oh shit, he's already here, I gotta go. Yeah I can't wait to see you. Hey listen, I gotta call you back in a bit okay? Okay, bye. Oh Jesus, I hear you! - Last time I clean your mess up Ferris. Last time we go through this shit! Never again! - Dad it was dumb-- - Say it, never again. - Never again. - I got enough on my fucking plate right now to be dealing with your juvenile bullshit! Now are we fucking clear?! - Yes. - Jesus Christ. - Dad, tell me what I can do to make this up to you. There is something, let me do it. - Oh what, you wanna return the favor? - Yes I do. - Okay sit down. Alright, tell me that you're paying attention. - I'm paying attention. - Well what I need is to get some documents from an old colleague of mine, Reese. You remember him? - Yeah. Okay I can do that. - Okay well there's a catch. You're gonna have to kind of take them from him. - Take. - You still with me Ferris? Focus here Ferris, I'm not just wasting my breath am I? - No I'm listening. - Okay, well Reese is expecting me to meet him tomorrow at the Whitney at three. And he's gonna have these documents with him. Instead you go, and when you see him, you just kind of snatch 'em from him. - Am I just supposed to mug this guy? - Well in an off-color sort of way. I mean get the documents without putting the guy in the hospital is the general idea. But it's gotta be clean. - Dad, why not just ask this guy for the documents? - Ferris if I could do that we wouldn't be having this conversation. This is how it's gotta go. Now are you up for it? - Yes. - Okay tell me what you're gonna do. - Get the documents from Reese, as clean as possible. I got a court appearance tomorrow at three dad. - Well nevermind that, I'll straighten it out. But you cannot fuck this up Ferris. I can't emphasize that enough. - Dad, if you're doubting me this much, why not just do it yourself? - Because A I have to be in court myself at that time, and B I'd like to see you come through for your old man for once. - Dad, it'd just be nice if you had a little more faith in me, that's all. - I do Ferris, I do. Today's just been a very grim day. - Well can you at least tell me why you have to steal these documents from this friend to begin with? - Well first of all he's not my friend. And what I've told you is all you need to know. Now I'm not putting you in harms way. This will be a cinch, promise. Alright? Hey, everything will be better tomorrow. - Dad, what about a ride? You know they impounded my car remember? - Borrow someone's car Ferris. You're resourceful. But make sure you go alone. Got it? - Yeah. I got it. - Open up Ferris, time for court! - Man you didn't need to come with me. Okay this isn't gonna take more than a minute. I don't know why you couldn't just let me borrow the car. - You kidding? Nobody drives Sweet Lucy but me. Besides man this is gonna so much fucking fun I'm excited, are you excited? - Nervous is more like it. - Dude, don't be such a fucking pussy man. - Hey, I'm not a pussy dude. This is important to my dad and I don't wanna fuck it up. - Yo, it'll be smooth man. I'm gonna smack that bitch around like a cheap puppet. - Just control yourself out there Zed. - Yo where is he? - It's not three yet is it? - Oh yeah. Ooh shit, I got a little something while we wait. Yeah. - Yeah man. Wow, where'd you get this? - Yo my boy down in Miami, pure kush. - Yo it feels like we've been sitting here a week. - Hey no more man, we can't miss this guy. - Shit I miss him already. - Hey you back with Ayla right? - Yeah what about her? - Yo she got any friends you can hook your boy up with? Big, small, black, white, candy striped? Shit, you know me, I'm not picky. - Zed, I don't think the girls she hangs out with would come within like 10 feet of you. - Shit please, yo I hit ass like nobody's business. - Whatever. - Speaking of hitting, one more? - No shit, I'm straight. - Come on, one more. I'm good. - Come on. It's calling your name. Ferris. Ferris please smoke me, please. Don't neglect the kush. - Okay. Jesus. Dude I just need one more hit and I'm like fucking cross eyed over here. Give me that lighter. Oh shit dude, wake up wake up Zed! Fuck! How long have we been out? - Dude how the fuck should I know man? - Jesus Christ, did we miss this guy? - I don't even know where the fuck I am man. - Dude there he is, that's him. That's him right there man. Come on come on. - Yo I'm hungry man. - Dude, start the fucking car, let's go. - Alright alright. - He's right there. Whatever daddy wants. Hey! You're gonna be sucking on hospital food bitch! Fuck you! - Jesus, what the fuck was that back there? - Yo, we had to get that briefcase didn't we?! - Piece of cake dad. These have got to be the heaviest fucking documents in the world. It went like clockwork. I thought we were gonna lose him there for a second but he just-- - Who's this? - Zed. You remember Zed? - No, I don't. Did he go with you? - Well he was my ride. - Would of been nice if you had informed about this earlier Ferris. - You knew I had to get there somehow. I needed a ride. - Yo it went smooth sir. - Dad, it's all good, there's nothing to worry about. - Tell your friend here not to speak to me again. Now, do you have any other surprises for me? I'm telling you dad, Reese didn't even see us coming. It was so clean, just like you said, easy. - Tell your friend to get out of my office right now. Have you seen this? - Seen what? - This! This shit! Does this look like the documents I needed? - Dad I... - Save it Ferris. Not a fucking word. Did I not make my instructions clear? Were they not simple enough? They were pretty fucking cut and dry I thought. - I know and I did what you asked. - Obviously Ferris you fucking didn't! Because if you did I wouldn't have a suitcase full of coke laying on my desk. Did he put you up to this? - Who Zed? - Yeah, that jack off who you made an accomplice and now who in the fuck knows who he's gonna tell. Jesus Christ Ferris, what were you thinking? - I was trying to do the right thing. - You don't know what that is Ferris. Hard to believe we got the same blood running through our veins. Now just go! - This was your idea. Okay remember that. - Yo your dad's a straight up dick face man. I'm sorry to say it but, not even a thank you? - Dude this is all your fucking fault! If you hadn't brought your precious fucking weed with you-- - Hey I didn't put that joint in your mouth! Hey! Do you think your dad will let us take that smack off his hands? Make some serious money with it. - Goodbye Zed. - Holy fuck! Always could sneak up on you. - What are you doing dad? Listen, come on inside, we need to talk. - Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I feel like somebody was in my place today. - Listen-- - Dad, I can't apologize enough for what happened today. - Be quiet for a second, listen. Now I can't sugar coat this so I'm just gonna come out and say it. I'm dying. Very soon. - What? I went to my doctor the other day and he told me that my hearts slowly giving out. I got a month, maybe less. - What the fuck are you talking about? - Ferris listen to me son. If you were ever gonna listen to me, listen to me now. What happened to me was a colossal fuck up beyond belief. Okay, on top of you bringing some fucking half wit into this. Icing on the cake there. But anyway, what's done is done. Now did anybody see you there? Did anybody see anything that happened? - No, we knocked Reese out, grabbed the case, and got the hell out of there. - What do you mean you knocked Reese out? - Zed did that part. - Jesus Christ. Well before that, was there anything that distracted you? Anything that maybe complicated the objective? - No. Are you sure? - Yes. - Alright well you realize it wasn't Reese who you knocked out? Reese isn't a fucking drug smuggler. You got that right? - Yeah. - Alright, well I don't know what the next move is yet but I just wanna make sure nothing happens to you. That's my only concern. - I just don't see how anyone could connect us to that case. I mean no one saw anything. You think it's being tracked? - No, the case is clean. But you don't just make off with something like this Scott free and get away with it. Now, I don't know what the next move is yet but I just want you to lay low until all this blows over, alright? - Okay. - I'm just so glad your mother's not here to see any of this. Oh, and another thing, that idiot friend of yours. You stay away from him until all this rolls over. He says a word to anyone and it goes bad for all of us. - He won't say anything dad, he's gonna be fine. - From what I saw, he was too dumb to wipe his own ass. - He won't be a problem. What about my court thing, did you take care of that? - Oh yeah court. That should be the least of your problems right now. Jesus, I swear I must be dreaming this shit. Alright Ferris I gotta go. - Dad. Are you really dying? - Yeah. - What do we do? - There's nothing we can do. It's just the hand I've been dealt. Hey, everything happens for a reason right? Hello this is Felix. It appears certain documents made it into the courtroom this morning that weren't supposed to but, you already knew that didn't you? - No, I didn't. Really, that's the road you wanna go down? Alright, well you're on borrowed time from here on out pal. Who is it? - For Christ sake. Fuck you think it is? - Hurry up, whatever took you so long? - I shouldn't be here at all. Open up the door and step back. What's with the piece? - I've had on me ever since. Don't know what the fuck happened next. - You had it on you ever since, but not when they made off with my coke. - Yeah. They were gone before I ever had the chance to get to it. - There were two of them right? I heard two voices on the phone. - Two. Yeah. - Yeah, you didn't see what they look like? Didn't see their faces? - No, they blindsided me. I swear I would of popped them right then and there if I could of. - Yeah. Oh yeah. How do you think we should dissolve this? - I'd start with the security cameras in the parking lot. You said they were wearing masks so, I don't think that's gonna help too much. - One was. I think. They were both, I can't remember. - Maybe both. Maybe I should just go door to door like I'm selling god damn vacuums and ask around. Well how would you go about it? Fucking enlighten me. - May seem impossible but, we will get our coke back. - My coke. I'm the one that's out their product here. I'm the one who has people to answer to if the situation isn't fixed right quick, not you. So again, what are your ideas for retrieving my coke? - Security cameras-- - Already mentioned that. Step off your little fucking amnesia trip and give me something I can use. - Honestly, that's all I can think of. I mean, realistically your options are pretty limited at the moment. My options? - I mean our options. - Answer this for me, was this an inside job? - A what? - Did you steal my coke from me? - You can't be serious. - Oh I'm serious as a heart attack. Be sharp with your response. Now what was it? - No it was not. - Well alright. Get your shit and let's go home. But why don't you let me hold onto that. You ain't gonna need it now. I always told you actions have consequences. Dad? Dad. - Felix here? - Do you have an appointment? - I don't make appointments, where is he? - He's out to lunch? - Where is that? I honestly-- - Nicole can you file this for me? Sure. - She'll set you up with an appointment. Okay I'll be out to lunch, I'll see you in about an hour. Okay, sounds good. - Nice try hooch. You lie to me again and I'll fist fuck your ass til you're talking like a sock puppet. Think I'm kidding? Where is your son? - I know you? - Bet your ass you know me, where is he? - Ahh, the bail bondsman right? - Look I'm in no mood to be fucked around today. Your son missed a court date, are you aware of this? - What's your name again? - Val, burn into your memory because I got a feeling this won't be our last conversation. - Mmm, everything's been settled. I spoke to Judge Cackston this morning. Him and I are old friends and everything's squared away. So your job is done here. - You took it upon yourself to do my job? Saved you the headache. - It's not how this works. - Well you can take that up with Judge Cackston. - Tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna pay a visit to Judge Cackston and if you're still feeding me shit I'm gonna come right the fuck back here and arrest your ass on the god damn spot. Now do you have anything you wanna tell me before I go? - Nope. - As far as I'm concerned your son's a fugitive, no matter what, I'm bringing him in. Bank on it. - Jesus. - Got you bitch! What the fuck. Hey! Come back! Keep on running coward! No matter what I'll get your bitch ass and it'll be payback when I do! Fuck! Really? Really?! After everything that we've been through?! That's what you leave me for?! Huh?! Don't! Don't you go! Hey! You fucking bitch! - You're that guy on TV. - The one and only sweetheart. Call me. - Yo the bitch probably sucking on hospital food right now. You're gonna be sucking on hospital food, bitch! - I'm gonna need you to come with me. - Yo you say something Tex? - I said you need to come with me. - I don't think so pal. - This isn't an option. Might ask. Why don't you fuck off cowboy? And that's all you know? Yes. Felix and Ferris huh? Look man it was a mistake. It was supposed to be somebody else. Man talk to me! Why are you doing this?! Because you took what's mine Zed. If I took something from you you'd want it back wouldn't you? Yeah I suppose. Suppose. You strike me as the type of person that isn't aware that actions have consequences. You ever been to Texas Zed? - No. - Well down along the Mexican border it's plenty different than any old god forsaken Midwest. You make the wrong moves down there, for example, you get caught doing what you did to me, you get your body chopped up and have your limbs dumped all along the street. Or if they didn't wanna take the trouble to go through all that they just block your head off and stick on a park in town square for all the spectators to see while they wait. Yeah actions have consequences. - Please don't kill me. I'm begging you man, please. It was Ferris's idea, not mine. - But you're still an accomplice here Zed! It never ceases to amaze me that when people get caught they want a free pass. They're not sorry for what they did, they're just sorry they got caught. One big fucked up dysfunctional family. It's as if none of you ever learned a lesson in your whole fucking life. Well, this ain't my first rodeo kid. - Look dude I'm sorry. It was a mistake man, I'm sorry for what I, what we did to you. Just tell me how I can fix it man, please tell me how I can fix it. - You can't do nothing Zed. You're in the abyss boy and there's no getting out. When I rolled in from Texas I had a nice long ride to decide what I was gonna do to whoever was responsible for this. Oh I'll find your friends. You can bet the farm on it. Everyone's gonna get what's coming to them. Please don't. Oh my god please. No one's listening to your pleas Zed! - No, no, no, no, no, no please! Please don't hurt me! - Listen to me! If God himself came down here right fucking now, he couldn't save you. You know why? 'Cause I'm the Grim Reaper motherfucker! Yeah that's it. You're such a fucking stallion. Should we switch positions honey? Talk about ruining a mood. - Tonight's just not the night sweetie that's all. Okay well you have to pay either way, you know that hun. - If you knew you had days to live, what would you do? - That's kind of a morbid question isn't it? - What, you never thought about it? - No baby, only thing I worry about is holding onto these looks for as long as I can. - Well I'm asking you now. What would you do? - I don't know. Float around the Bahamas, soak up some sun. Shit, I don't know. - Come on, your whole life there's nothing you wanted to do before your chips were cashed in? - Everybody wants to do something. It's just that some of us run out of time before we ever get that chance. - Wow, now that's pretty deep for a hooker. - Deeper than you were a minute ago shit head. I hope your days are fucking numbered! - Don't worry, they are. - Will you at least talk to me? You owe me an explanation god damn it! Ayla say something! - What?! - I need to talk to you! - This conversation has run it's course Val! - We never finished it Ayla! And what are you doing in bed with a piece of shit huh?! - What I do anymore is none of your god damn business do you understand that?! - So you can just go from me to him like that? - Whatever. - I miss you Ayla! - Val, those are just words okay? You and I, we're not good together, we're not the same and you need to get that! Just understand that! - Wait a minute! I'm sorry I scared you with the proposal. Had I known it would turn out like this I wouldn't of ever done it. But sometimes you gotta throw caution to the fucking wind and let the chips fall where they may. I took a chance. My timing may have been off but that alone, you can't just erase what we had. Can it? - I'm not ready to go down this road. Not with you, not with anyone. - I'm not asking that. All I'm asking for is a clean slate. How bad can that be? - Did you catch up with him? - Your ex, no. When I do, he's gonna be in a world of hurt, that's a guaran-damn-tee. Why him? - He's just the one guy that I knew I wouldn't get attached to. - Well the next time you talk to him it's gonna be behind a thick pane of glass. Look, I won't keep you. Sorry for showing up at your work like this but there's some things a man just can't run away from. As the Duke would say. - The Duke. You know, I miss our conversations and our John Wayne Marathons so, it could be something that we could do again sometime. I gotta get going. - Okay. I may just take you up on that. - Yeah, hey Richard. Yeah good good. Listen, I'm gonna come down and close my account. Yeah I know but this is an emergency. I'm gonna need all cash. I'll be down later today okay? Alright great thanks, bye. - Hello there little lady. I'm looking for Felix, he in? - I'm sorry, he called in sick today. Would you like to leave a message for him? - No. I'd like for you to tell me where he lives and I'll just visit him at his house. - I can't give you that kind of information. - Why I think you can. It's extremely important I find out where he is. - No I can't. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a lot of work to do. You don't wanna leave a message. - Is that his office over there? - You can't just walk in-- - Bitch I'm not leaving until I find what I'm looking for! So sit the fuck down and stay out of my way. Where is your fucking boss?! He's not in. - Where is the cocksucker? - I'm not gonna tell you anything with that kind of language. Obviously he's some place he doesn't want you to know. - This, that's cute. This is an emergency and I need to speak to him right this minute! He's not answering his cell like the bitch he is! You got a different number for him? - No I don't. Now you can leave a message with me, otherwise, best of luck. - Don't try this shit with me again. Remember what I warned you about last time. Start talking or bend over and I'll make you start talking. Otherwise, give me his home address. - I'm not allowed to give out personal information! And if I could I sure wouldn't give it to you. Now you can leave a message, otherwise there's the door. - This is a legal matter! And I'm not leaving here until you give me a different number or home address for this idiot! Do not try my patience lady, 'cause I have run clean out. - Like I said-- - Give me one of the other right fucking now! - A bit jumpy aren't we? - Who are you? - Well I'm just a leprechaun looking for his pot of gold. Speaking of which, I believe you have something that belongs to me. - You're kidding right? - Do I look like a joker? - Look here partner, why don't you show some ID and we can straighten this on out real quick. - I got one better. How about you show me my coke and I won't make 'em have to use dental records to identify your body house. - Who the fuck do you think you are threatening me in my town? I think you got lost. Found yourself in the wrong place there cowboy. - You know, for someone staring death in the face, you're awful ballsy. I like that. Sound like you charge hell with a bucket of ice water. I didn't peg you for that kind of guy. - I'm the kind of guy you don't want to fuck with. - Is that a fact? Funny, I always thought that with me. - One way to find out. Let me escort you out. I'm taking. Bail bondsman? Are you shitting me? I did walk in the wrong fucking room. - Pick up, pick up, pick up Ferris. Come on. Jesus Christ! Answer the fucking phone! Fuck! Ferris. Ferris open up! Ferris it's your father! Fuck. - Well this has been one cluster fuck situation, wouldn't you say partner? - Get the fuck off my car redneck. - Well I never knew the Midwest was loaded with so many dumb fucks. I said get off the fucking car. - Your kind must be a dime a dozen here. You're just some kind of cowboy aren't ya? Just all over the place, doing whatever you please. Making a fucking mess of everything. Anyone ever tell you actions have consequences? - Seems to me you're the cowboy. - Touche. - Max sent you didn't he? - I don't know no jack off named Max. Nah, matter fact you sent me when you decided to make off with my narcotics. And I'm not leaving until I get what's mine. And I tell you something else partner, you about worn my patience right to the fucking end. Now here's how this is gonna go. You give me back my coke, I give you back your son, even trade. How's that sound? - You don't have Ferris. - You sure as shit can't find him, so where else could he be? Look here partner, any other time I'd slit your fucking throat as sure as I'm standing here without missing a beat. You dug this hole and I am the only way out of it. So what's it gonna be? How do I know he's okay? - You don't. Just like I don't yet know if you got every last ounce of my coke. I guess we have to inject a little trust between us. I'll be at your office at midnight. You know what to bring if you want to see your son. Don't disappoint me now. - This motherfucker! Damn cowboy. Fuck. Hi, you're the last person I wanna ask for a favor right now. But I need a favor. - Answer Ferris. Answer the phone Ferris! Jesus Christ where is this kid? - Are you feeling better Felix? - No! I'm up to my neck in shit! - Oh. - Go home. - So early? - Yes! I want you gone! So, twice in one day? Sorry for calling. You were the first person I thought of and I just-- - You know what, it's fine. It's fine. - Jesus I feel like I've been put through the fucking grinder these past few days. Just one thing after another after another, and you say no to marrying me, you go and move out of the apartment-- - I know I know. But, what happened after you left me? I thought you left me. - I meant earlier today. Look at you. You look like hell. - Oh I happen to go toe to toe with a fucking cowboy of all people. - A cowboy? - Man I catch up with that cocksucker he's gonna wish he never set foot in this fucking town again. Let me tell you, ever since we split, nothing has gone right. Nothing. - You know what that means? I'm your good luck charm. - Maybe. As soon as you showed up, truck started working. - True. You know I'm not gonna see him again. It's none of my business what you do remember? - Look, I don't wanna be that girl who doesn't know what they want okay? I know that we had a good thing, I know that. I'm not stupid. What I felt with you it was real and there's no denying that. I just, I felt too good to be true and I couldn't imagine myself deserving something like that. And then out of the blue you say that you want to spend the rest of your life with me. I didn't know how to handle that. It's not something that you run away from or hide. I'm so sorry Val. I'm so sorry. I wanted to play it safe. I didn't wanna take the risk I guess. But I wanna be with you. I wanna try the clean slate. - I'll be by tonight, we'll talk. - Okay. - Maybe catch up on the Duke some. - Duke, yeah that would be good. Oh. Val look. Yeah. Ferris are you okay, where are you? I'm fine. Alright never mind that. The bag you took from my house, I know you have it. Now get to my office right away and bring it with you. I think I may have a way out of this. - Sure, sure, fine, yeah whatever. Ah man, I missed you babe. - Oh I missed you too. - Hey, you and I from here on are gonna be fucking awesome okay? I promise. - That sounds nice and all, but how many promises have you made and broke with me Ferris? What?! - So this time's gonna be different? - Oh it will. Come on, I'm new and improved okay? You don't have anything to worry about. Hey I'm the man. Little fucking man. - Oh yeah. - Alright, this will just take a second, so just wait here. I might need to work on that. Dad. Hey dad you here? - Gotcha! - Oh my god. - Always could sneak up on ya. - Getting a little old for that aren't ya dad? - Hey, one day you're miss me doing that. Alright, come on in. I'm pass the point of no return Ferris. My hearts a ticking time bomb. I mean Reese was supposed to be the opportunity to get the money for a heart transplant but, that didn't pan out. And everything just kinda spiraled out of control. There's no light at the end of the tunnel for me. But there can be for you. What's this? - It's all my savings. And a ticket to Venezuela. Now you go there and don't ever come back. Now where's the bag? - Wait dad, what are you talking about? - I'm saying I'm not gonna be around for much longer. And that's your ticket our of here. Now where's the bag Ferris. - Dad I can't go. - Excuse me? - Listen, I've put a lot of thought into this and Zed said there's a way we can turn all that coke into a ton of cash. That's what I'm gonna do when I get a hold of him. He's been dodging my calls lately but-- - Are you fucking kidding me?! You're gonna do what?! - Dad, I have a girlfriend I'm trying to start a life with. I mean what about that? You just want me to flee the country and leave her behind? - Ferris I'm trying to save your life here. And you go and get greedy?! Now where's the fucking bag Ferris?! - We get that money we can see about getting you a heart transplant. That's why I'm doing this! To save you dad. I have a chance to turn this whole thing around. What? - You undeserving little shit! You're not doing this for me. You're doing this for your own fucking benefit! When I'm the one with one foot in the grave. After everything I've done for you, you go and bury me like this? - Listen, this is my decision okay?! We already did it your way! It's my turn. And that's it. This will work dad. - You're just gonna fuck it up Ferris, you always do. - How would you feel about having enough money to leave KC for good huh? - Yeah, I'd be all for it. Yeah? - Yup. Did your daddy raise your allowance? - What the hell is that supposed to mean? - You take everything so personally. - God, Ayla I'm just trying to talk to you okay? Just meet me halfway. - Okay, it's kind of annoying sometimes. - What? - Felix, this is Dr. Widmark. You might wanna be sitting down for this. I was about to end my shift when I was going over some of your blood work, and you're not gonna believe this. But it appears that you're in the clear. I checked everything four times and it came back negative. - Negative? What are you talking about negative? - Well I'm showing that your heart is just as fine as it was last year. I'm as astonished as you are. - Four days ago you said I had less than a month. Now you're telling me I'm fine? What kind of fucking doctor are you? - Well from what I'm looking at, it was brought on by stress. Try reducing anything stress related and I'm sure you'll notice a difference. - Stress? Are you fucking kidding me?! Well I thought you'd be relieved by this Felix. I can't imagine any of my patients being unhappy about this type of news. - Relieved? You just killed me. - Not yet counselor. Mind me calling you counselor? Felix just sounds fucking dumb. Anyhow here I am, a man of my word. - You mind if I ask you a question? Shoot counsel. - How did you even find out about me? - I happen to run into a nice enough fella willing to give me you and your boys name. Which reminds me, I'm gonna need your car when we're through here. Mine's got a body in the back. Starting to stink something awful. - And who was this fella that did the squealing? - I believe his name was Zed. Zed. Felix Ferris. Where the fuck you people get your names from around here? Anyhow, he's the varmint stinking up your parking lot as we speak. I tell you counselor, you really gotta be more careful the company you keep. That boy folded like a cheap suit. Not to worry though, I took care of him for you Texas style. Actions have consequences as I like to say. Now enough small talk. Where's my fucking coke? - Do you wanna tell me where this condescending attitude is coming from? - You know what, just forget I even said anything okay. - No, tell me okay. I don't understand why you're talking to me the way you are when I'm about to do what I'm about to do. - What are you about to do Ferris? Ugh. - Speaking of my son, you gonna tell me where he is? - He's in a real safe place. - Well that's comforting. - Well counselor, you know why I've been as calm as I've been with you? - It's because you have no idea where your fucking blow is, and you don't have my son. So you've got nothing to bargain with. - That's why they pay you the big bucks isn't it? Sharp as a wit. Got me all figured out don't ya? I like that. Makes it more fun. You having fun? - I would just appreciate it if you would show me a little more respect Ayla. I'm about to make your dreams come true. I mean how many guys can say that to you, come on. Alright, I just gotta roll inside for just a second. We're gonna head over to Zed's. Just try to think of something sweet to say okay? I'll be back. - Jesus, you're supposed to be up there waiting for him. - Change of plan. - He's coming right back! - I know. I've come to realize that what you want and what you need, they aren't the same thing. You and I just can't make it like this. We got a real mess on our hands right now and I thought I could just look past it and make it work but I can't. - Val look, I said I want to be with you. I want to be with you. There's no one else in the picture. It's just you and I. - That's how I wanted it. It's how we had it. To get that back I just don't see it happening. - I love you-- - Don't, don't. Look my car is parked down the street. You're gonna drive on out of here and I'm gonna take care of him. - Maybe we could like-- - Look, go. Alright Ferris, let's go. - Awe baby you're-- - You've been a bad boy Ferris. First skipping bail on me and now all this nose candy. Talk about going from bad to worse. Don't think daddy can bail you out of this one. - She fucking sell me out? - Nah. Well maybe a little. What the fuck is this? Appreciate the offer but I'm still taking your ass in. Whoa. What a waste. Told you I'd get your bitch ass. - I don't know, maybe I'm just whistling Dixie but if I don't hear from you in the next three seconds where the fuck my coke is, they're gonna be carrying you out of here feet first. What'll it be counselor? Answer it. Answer it, put it on speaker. Hey Felix, this is your son's tenacious bail bondsman with some good news! I finally found the prick along with some very large amount of cocaine in his possession. So I'm pretty sure you can guess where he's headed. Best of luck saving him from this one. Asshole! - Guess you know where your coke is now. - Motherfucker! Dirty motherfucker! I'm through fucking with you people. Get your keys, you and I are going to find this bastard bondsman and my coke. Don't open your mouth. - Hey. - Come here and deal with this bullshit. Fucking people think you can just take whatever the fuck you want and burn me like this? You ought to get. You're driving. I'll tell you something else, after we're through with this bondsman and I catch up with your son, I'm taking my god damn time. Get in. Get in! Fucking go. - She wouldn't have said yes to the proposal. Look at it like I kinda did you a favor. Fuck you! - Oh by the way, remember when we were at your apartment a few days ago and you shoved me onto the bed needlessly and I told you I'd get my payback? Woo! Yeah! Life is good. - Was it worth it counselor? Hmm? All this, was it worth it? Ferris. - That damn sack of shit! There he goes. Turn this car around and get after him. - The hell with this. - The fuck you doing? - I'm fucking through. - The fuck you are! - You wanna kill me than kill me. But I ain't giving up my son. - Remember something counselor, actions have consequences and I'll be back for you. - That's his car. Got the gun ready? Yeah. - Fuck. Felix! It's checkout time! - Ayla hey. Hey. - I know this is what you're here for. - Thanks. So, did you end up catching him or? - You know I did. He won't be enjoying freedom anytime soon. - Good. So, it's not gonna work between us is it? - No. - Another time, another place, who knows. - Yeah who knows. - So, what's next for you Val? - Sleep. Lots of sleep. Then I'm gonna track down that cowboy and finish where we left off. And you? - I guess, I guess I'm gonna go on to the next chapter. Hey. You know if you need someone to watch the Duke with, just let me know alright? - Felix in? Arrested last night? Lady, that is the best fucking news you've told me all week.
