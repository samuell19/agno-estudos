it's you, Joe? Yes. I wanted to write, but ... Well? I did not know I was going to come here until I'm here. You are hungry? Do not worry about me. No problem. Chrystal! Where are you? Chrystal! It's your mother. sweetheart. Preciosa. And to say that I chose this name. dear, come down from this tree. This dog was beautiful, but he now seems broken. I think he has brain damage. Joe threw beaver poison into the garden ... and the dog was poisoned. Because he slept for three days ... and when he wakes up, he was crazy like a beaver. Have you lost your mind? you should not leave this man put his feet here. it's his mother's house. Come back with us. Boys can organize the old house of your grandfather. he sleeps on the porch. Lord, have mercy. First of all ... you should not have married with him .. He has kindness in him, mom. remember.... Under all the suffering and misery there is light. You did not know I was listening? I blame the books he was reading all the time. Tennessee Wilson and all those people. I saw him once, drunk. In the show of Johnny Carson. Johnny had fun with her. This man will never be another drink. Truman Capote was, mom. That too. With his glassy eyes, Johnny was embarrassed. Then I screamed ... Damn, you ruined the life of my daughter! The words came out of my mouth. I am pretty angry. He cleaned the garden and was employed. We will see how much it will take a long time. Honey, make sure that your grandfather is fine. He is fine. He fled several times. What? To go where? Gelda Hanson there seen in his garden. He stole all his clothes .. How is he? He would kill if they knew certain things they do. - A bad day? - Yes. I have to go sit down. For 20 years, you have endured this pain ... and it seems as if nothing had happened. God, I hate that! Anyway ... I made an appointment. To be able to leave this place. We will sell our field if necessary. Broken neck, broken spine, my ribs are broken inside. I have a lot of nerves affected. Let's try. Come on, little one. Yes. go my daughter. My kiss will take away the pain .. You spent too much time with ours Chrystal. Go home to pass a little time ... with someone else. He said we can not miss. So Joe came back. Relax, I did not talk with the spirits or with your mother. Please log in. Last year, I did not have a good time. his fundamentalists assholes trying to shut me up, dear. They said it's the house of Satan, but I do not work with the devil. I am like everybody else. I thank the tourists because they make me laugh. until they start to talk about their mothers. What brings you here, Chrystal? I do not know. Let's see. My God, you are so worried. We need to clean your inner self, Chrystal To keep you safe. Outside, outside, outside! Close your eyes. Prepare your broom. Tell Mrs. Gladys to leave us. Go away-Mom .. Well. Joe now. Go away Joe. Now, all your sorrow. Stay with me, Chrystal. Go away, shame. It's time to stop, man. Hey, man. I never saw anyone working as much as you, man. Damn it, man. You could have burned. I hate to have someone behind me. Very well. it's official, we're lost. Return on the main road and try again. We could make a lot of money with all these boxes. Do you want a beer? Very well. I do not know how you managed to drink this thing. Must have been in hell to get there. He can not believe NIM Finally I did with me. The last time I escaped from prison ... I knew I could do it, friend. Where are they found? Inside, in the ventilation. About 50 meters from my cell. damned. I was hungry. Why? This child is in your neck. You can take it metaphorically or literally, it does not really matter. I saw it with my mind. You must let the child go. How? If I had all the answers, I would have a more beautiful house. They said that if you are not enthusiastic when you are sure it will be when you go out. I know junk food, Mexican gangs and others. They say that if you are white and if you behave well That's what I heard. Do you have marijuana? No, man. The prosecutor followed the region. I know where he is. Or? Near Brown Creek. I can not cross the city. If I am taken once, I will be a recidivist. However, it is probably damaged. Have you thought about cultivating? Everyone says that you always had the best grass. They said she was legendary. I have a talent for that. I'll tell you what you can do ... We could make a good profit. We? I would receive a small fee for my relationships. Things have changed. Now he has a big deal. Said my father ... Hey, it's Larry, right? Yes. Maybe you have some grass. - Hola, Hog. - Hola, Larry. Come on, guys come on. - Back. - Why? Because I'm saying it, fool - I thought you wanted some grass. - I changed my mind. What are you doing? Wait, Hog! Fuck, man. Damn it. - What was that? - I do not know. I thought you were someone else. It's your lucky day. - How is your friend? - He is done. - You are stoned all the time. - We should celebrate. guy. Surely, who is with you? - Joe. - Who is Joe? - You know Chrystal, right? - the broken neck. Be careful what you say about my cousin. sorry, I did not want to offend you. Chrystal is Joe's wife. - Do you know Chrystal, Shorty? - I saw here. Let's talk with a joint. do you have marijuana? Perhaps. How much bobbin is left, hog? - Only one. - We will use the box. What is your real name? Everyone calls me Hog. His real name is Hubert. And you? Lies. Do you know Joe's wife, Stanley? Yes, I already saw it. Rarely out of the house. I have never seen it, Joe. Do you work far? No, Hubert. Go further. What will we do? We are waiting for a good Samaritan. What are you trying to do, Larry? Relax. What you do with someone else's wife, it's none of my business. - What are they talking about? - Are you working away from here, Joe? - He was in prison ... - Since twenty years. That's why you have not seen it. Really? Yes seriously. - What did he do? - drug trafficking first. He was caught trying to escape the prison. they lost a child in the accident. It took an hour to find him. Chrystal was lying almost dead with the broken neck. Today, by a miracle she is walking again. What happened to Joe? They found him 76 meters from the car. He was unconscious. he had slight cuts, the it was fine. You know what they say ... " if he had been drunk, he would be dead. - And their baby? They have never been found. I imagine someone has found his blood. something there. But they found nothing, not a bone, not a shoe. While they looked? A few weeks. We were young people. We used to go through prison ... and you could hear Joe screaming. "Let me out of here to find my baby. He never left it. Maybe the baby is still alive. - Maybe he was raised by wolves. - Shut up, fool. Or beavers. Maybe he was adopted by a beautiful family of beavers. Hubert? Yes, Joe? Do you have cigarette paper? Guard, guard. Do not let go or hit my face, fat bacon. hold, hold. It was hard. do you want Stanley? No, man. I am so fucked. When she was grown by Joe, I was not born yet. It's impressive, man. She has a special flavor. Larry, you catch me. Do you want a beer, Joe? I do not drink, Hubert. You have to go, Hog. I must go home. - Why? - Because I work silly tomorrow. You do not have to sleep. - To hell with work, we'll have a good time. - Yes. I think someone is coming. Are you stuck. Yes. You think you can help us? No I can not. What? I do not have tools. Excuse me? Anyway, I think that you must be towed. I understand. Where are you going? We ... We're looking for the house of Mr. Jasper Roads, you know? - Yes Look who we have here. To be damned. Professor. - Good. - Nice to see you. - And his partner ... - My name is Barry. My name is Pa Yes, it's a variation of "daddy" made by my niece. They come from the University of Chicago ... to record our music. Well, let's start. Okay. Two steps. Listen to these guitars. Southern rock n roll. You know what I mean? - Hubert. - volume? We have company. - I think it's the police. - shit! Accelerate, Hog. close the window. - We have to find a place to throw. - What? Grass, idiot. Accelerate, man! Now, Joe. Leave it, man. Hubert, stop the car. I doubt he has a search warrant. What should I do, Larry? Anything here? Why not throw. we can have others. Hubert, I told you to slow down and stop the car. Prepare your papers. Damn it. Hog, are you in a hurry? No, Charlie, just a little. You have not seen the lights? Not immediately. You know how these roads are dangerous? Yes sir. - Hello, Shorty. - Charlie. Larry, are you hanging out with the kids nowadays? You know how he is, Charlie. In fact, no, I do not know. It has been a long time, Joe. Who drank tonight? - Just a few beers. - Identification Save. - And you, Shorty? - I do not drink a lot. - I suggest you do not go through the city. - Yes sir. - Go slowly. - Yes sir. - Will you go with them? - What? Yes, sir, I will do it. what's in the trunk, Joe? You did not intend to throw away thing, no? There are only tools. I hear you, you work on these barns. Yes. - They are difficult to do. - Yes indeed. Welcome home, Joe. What are you laughing about? I do not know, I can laugh. You're gone, man. What are you laughing about? I do not know. You're an idiot. I'm going to smash you, man. - Excuse me, Larry. - They look like two girls. Joe? It was bullshit, man. Yes, it was really bad. It was shit, Joe. Peggy is here? I asked myself the same thing. Who is Peggy? - I know this place. - Few people know it. Damn it. fried fish. Do you know anyone here? Yes. Can I eat your cabbage? Yes. Can not find the girls, Larry? No, Snake, only that. We are the pilots. Your tongue is fat like your face. This is Joe. I did not think you would be alive. It's life. life changes. Joe, are you still angry? You still blame me for what happened few years ago. Joe? Let me say something clear, you've never seen me drugged. Anyone who says otherwise will be eliminated. And if you want to join our "Farming community" ... You need my approval. No grass is grown without the authorization of the Snake. Okay? It's true that Joe ... you should know that ... while you were gone, your wife ... How can I say? I did not want to have sex with her. I found ... You must know. Snake always says shit. Can you order more fish? Charlie is a good cop. He was sad about his wife. she died of cancer. Here all die of cancer. Cancer, cancer. I had more time to read in recent years. I read Darwin. You are the missing link, Snake. You need help. To do what? We have unfinished business. You can leave your sister here. Come on, brother. We will fight! Come on, asshole. Come on. Come on. The reason I thought that this girl is your sister .. it's because she's too young to be your mother. I know it's easy ... You do not have to leave the house to have a date. It's funny, man. Funny. Diablos. Come on, man. Come on. - Strike snake! - Very good, man. Which way am I going, man? Do you know why your penis is so small? Because your mother is your father's sister. What makes you nephew and son. Do you call your Uncle Papa? Uncle Papa? Come on, Snake! Come on, man. - Joe is hard, right? - He is angry. Ok, let's take a break. what are the recordings for? I will use them for my book on American popular music. It will be a big book. It will be complete. Society is really about interaction with the music in the community. The music takes children away from television, this is a good thing. For sure. I bet that tonight Chrystal will act for us. - Are you singing something? - No. Sing us something. It was a long time ago. I do not want to put pressure on you ... But I bet your grandmother will smile in the sky if she hears you singing. rocking chair? Well. Is this the note, right? I think. well? What do you want? Do you want me to hit? Hell, man. Well. I understood it well. Do you want more? Yes! Yes! Fuck you, man. Tell your mother that I greet you. Are you sure there is no problem if we spend the night here? No, the recording will end tomorrow. Thanks my God! What is happening? Preciosa. Enter the house. They spend the night here. Make yourselves at home. What is it? How can I know? I will be happy to return to the United States. Barry? You can not defend equality ... and not respect diversity. You are right. Listening... I will shoot the dog. I have it, man. (white trash, is brilliant.) What do you want? I come not to remain resentful after last night. It's better than having relationships sexual intercourse with my sister. With young people. The fact is that ... You can not grow grass without my permission. So I came to give you a chance. I can not hear you, Larry. Let me talk to him, okay? Hazlet. I know you want to grow grass. We will face. There are many who cultivate these days, Joe. This is the only way for a poor man to be able to keep this earth. It can be sold at a price twice. snake has contacts. important relationships. If you stay away from federal lands ... and you use your own land, the risk is minimal. What are you doing with him? Snake worked hard on this. That's the way things are. If we go ... Did you grow grass or consume? He is not to blame. It's your problem. - He's out of control. - Someone should help him. More marijuana grow. Really? Can you offer something else? If heap something to say, say it. The things I said about Chrystal were true. Get out of my land, Larry. I'm not saying it's a whore ... I'm just saying that this girl is not doing well. Preciosa! Hey, I'm telling you all this because you're my cousin. Very good, man. How did he go? You better look behind your back. I can enter? You have already returned. Chrystal, Am I still your husband? No divorce papers yet. But I'm still your husband? Come on Joe, do you want my pussy? Because I do not care, you can use it. She is no longer special. For 20 years, I've been told what has to be done. I used it to meditate each step ... ... then after a certain time I gave up. I have resigned myself. I could not stand anymore to look back. And I dare not look to the future. I know what you're feeling. I was told to get up, and I did it. They tell me to eat, and I obey. They tell me to go to the hall of bath, and I obeyed. And one day, I was told to leave and I left. Now my mind is empty. I'm sorry, Joe. I do not even know what the director looks like. God will fill this void. Chrystal? Why did I come back here? I wonder why. I can not tell you what to do. I'm not your keeper, Joe. If you want me to leave, I'll leave. - I do not know. - You want me to stay? - I do not know, Joe. - Do you want me to sit on the porch? What do you want, Chrystal? May my pain go away. that's all. Just for a few minutes. You can do it for me? Yes. Yes that's it. This pleases me. You have beautiful hands. When I came back and you were here. I began to feel things that I had not felt for a long time. I began to feel hope. I am happy. But let's hope it gives you want other things ... .. crazy things like forgiveness. - That sort of thing. - Yes, It must not be for now. I can wait. Yes. Yes. Yes. We could start again. it may not be too late for that. Yes. - Maybe we could ... - Yes. - Refound a family. - Yes Yes. What? We could have another baby. Oh my God. Oh my God. Chrystal? I can not... no... What? I can not have children anymore. Forward. Have you already started to pack? Who is here? Me. Chrystal. Herself. Was it Simkens Perm? How? Yes it's me. I brought some poetry. How? My grandmother wrote poetry and I thought that you could possibly use it. This is not the subject of my book. I did not know. I would like to hear it though. I was walking on the sand of the beach ... looking for souvenirs for my friends ... seashells, coral, pieces of lobster ... thanks to the pink sea and clean the ocean. We can only ask ourselves, what are we looking for ... As the world is big and we are small. These thoughts come to me while I walk alone ... looking for memories on the beach. Beautiful. That's all? No. What is that? Feel the fragrance, please. What is this smell? Eucalyptus. it was my child's blanket. Your child? Sometimes I do not remember his smell anymore. Thank you. Why? to have come, and to have listened to me. Sometimes I think it's easier .. Quiet, calm. Sorry, I do not know why I did that. - Everything is fine, Chrystal. - Not at all . I ... the days are difficult. You destroy everything you touch. I think it's in your nature. I do not kill, Chrystal. I thought you could change. He was very proud. I thought that I could change. God took all my pride. There is no pride in the pain. There's no. And now... I know why you are here. Why? You do not seek my forgiveness. You want your redemption. You can have it, Joe. We can have it. Do you want to have it, Joe? Redemption. redeem himself. You love Me? Yes. You have to get him out of me. What are you talking about? The baby. He is inside my neck. I have to cut it. I think he's rotten. We have to make a big hole. You enter and ... Chrystal, no! no fear, Joe. take that damn thing out of me! What you say does not make sense. Please, Joe. go there, please. Please... do it for me, if you love me ... do it I will do it then. - Not that, Chrystal. - Do not touch me. stop now. it's you who should have died ... you know! you! you! Not him. you. you, no, no. you! Not him. Police! Do not move! Hands in the air! I'm not moving! Where is Joe? - The house is clean. - That the other site. Were they bored? Let's go. We knew they were coming. Joe was burying Preciosa when they arrived. Someone killed my dog. it's probably the same Who called the police. How's your daughter, Charlie? She is fine. I think she is your pride. You know it Chrystal ... Charlie. Are you missing your wife? it's sometimes difficult. Enjoy your life Charlie, it will not always be the case. Have you had luck? We found plantations, but they had been destroyed. I am sorry. We will put them in prison when we find them. I do not think Joe planted marijuana. It feels like a shot. Joe has always been unlucky. Joe! Joe! Joe! One year later I did not find the cake. No cake, mom. I wanted to bring Joe back, but I will not go to that search. Charlie ... I sometimes feel that he is watching over me. You are thinking of starting all over again. We must take with a coffee. It is very good. Well. Now ... Tell me how is your pretty girl. Ophelia, no? Yes that's right. I'm glad you chose an old name. It was my grandmother's first name. That's right, it's true. Do not you take him on a hunt with you, Charlie? No. We go fishing. Well, but a girl needs a woman next to her. Chrystal, have you seen Ophelia lately? please, Mom. What? Spend time with her grandmothers. That's good, any woman can teach. Subtlety has never been one of my mother's strengths. I speak from experience. it may not be my business ... but Ophelia needs someone next to her like a grandmother. My God! Take off that dress now, sir! Why? Because men do not wear dresses. It's pretty. Now, no more coffee for you. Grandpa runs, runs! I can not believe it. I have never met anyone who wrote a book. Look at page 304. History of folk music. My God, it's me! Read the title. Chrystal Catchum sang "rocking chair" ... at Jasper Podogro's house, in the Ozarks. You are also in the acknowledgments. Look at that, I'm in a book. It's a beautiful picture. You never thought of leaving here, Chrystal? Yes. After the accident, when Joe was in prison ... and that my baby is dead. Why did not you do it? I do not know. Probably you think you do not deserve to live. Looking back, I'll have to be. I'm on it. Colleen? Yes? My turn. What? I will show you something. There is a beautiful valley there, Colleen. When I was little, my grandmother took me there every spring. Picking herbs for tea, Wild mushrooms for canning ... and wildflowers to beautify. She told me how to find all these things ... just as an old Indian has him learned when she was little. Then at the end of the days I was with these nets full ... She tells me schutttt, Chrystal ... Listen, listen attentively. I focused to hear well. Do you hear that? you can hear more and more flowers and the growing grass. I did not hear anything, but I said: "Oh, yes, grandmother. I hear ... I can hear the flowers more and more. She squeezed my hand firmly and said ... I know you'll get there one day, Chrystal. And now, I can hear the flowers growing. I also hear ... the sadness of their song. That's what fascinates me. Have you always been blind? Since the age of three. I fell off a chair. Life is funny. Very funny. Quiet, Snake. Are you the one driving, Larry? No. So shut up there. Will you give me that? I do not want to participate in that. You are already participating, so do not move! Come. - blind as a bat! What happened, man? Fate, luck, bad luck? I have to go home, Snake. Damn it. Ok, everyone is calm. I just want to know why ... Chrystal opens her legs ... for all young people or black ... who request it. It hurts me to know that ... you do not want a mature white man. Am I wrong? She never looked at me. Hog? It was "no" Larry! Yes, he is family. We are three, Hog you go first. Hog? I can not. You can not? - Are you gay or something? - No no. I do not want to do that. Why, for ethical reasons? I do not want to do it. Man! Look, it's a pretty girl ... you can have it for free, friend. Well, if you do not want it, everything is fine. Dry your tears, man, shit! Ned. Shoot. On which? On Hog. On Hog? Pull him in the skull. I do not want to kill Hog. Give me the gun. No, Snake. What did you say, Larry? It's time to jump, Larry. Let's do as he says, okay? In the car? - Wait, darling. - Or on the floor. Yes. In the car, darling. Okay, let's go. I was shot in the ass! I was shot in the ass! I was shot in the back! Drop your weapon, Snake. I'll kill you for that! I am already dead. I'm not involved in that, Joe. I have nothing to do with that. I swear, we are cousins. Snake has an agreement with the three others to accept to testify. However, you will not need to go through a trial. I received a letter from Colleen. Devil. I regret what happened to him. He says there are many people who are dangerous. Have you seen Joe? No, Charlie. Snake is convinced he is a ghost. When we took the testimony of these three ... there was no trace of him. No footprints, no bullets, nothing. Some guys said they saw him walking in the fog when they were hunting. But he disappeared. Some even think they saw him at the bar. It must be hard not to know. Not knowing if you want to continue living. I wish things are different. Joe has always been unlucky. I'm talking about us, Chrystal. I would like things to be different between us. Charlie ... Charlie ... you are a good man. But I waited for Joe all my life. I waited but I did not know you were waiting. And something tells me that I do not can not stop now. Thank you for your honesty, Chrystal. Joe. What happened to you? A little baby. Ho, it's nice. It's so cute. Take him to the house. Can I see it? Yes. You brought me a little boy. Yes. You're a little hungry, little one. Yes. I think he has enough. I watched you from the forest. I know. I could not... I know. But as I spent a lot of time in the woods ... I thought I could find ... our child for you. I know this will sound strange, but sometimes I saw it from the corner of my eye ... and when I turned to him, he disappeared. I stopped eating and sleeping ... to find him ... but he always has a length ahead of me. Through the mountains, in the caves .. Then one day I went ... where he could be. I went to the accident site. I had been there several times, but this time it was different. This time there was peace at this place. true peace. So I waited ... and he was there. We have searched for a long time. He did not look happy, sad or angry. He seemed just at peace. Then he turned and left. I saw it too, Joe. After the accident. I remember that I I said goodbye. he waited all this time for you also say goodbye. I know he's fine. I think your mom is very worried. Tell him I'm sorry. I will do it. I did not have clear ideas. You made a gesture, Joe. It's a very nice gesture. I can not go back. Can you say his name, Joe? I am too tired to go back. Said his name, Joe. Joseph Catchum Jr. It's over, Joe. Leave the baby inside and come here now. Joe! Take the baby and go to the back of the house. I'll wait for you, darling. I know you, Chrystal. I know. Joe! Joe, I promise you that if you go out ... I have to stop you, Joe. Okay, Charlie. I'll do what I can for you, Joe. Take care of her. I'll take care of her, Joe. You promise? I promise you, Joe. No!
