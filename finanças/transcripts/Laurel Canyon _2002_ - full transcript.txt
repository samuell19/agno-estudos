You want me to stop? No, don't stop. Why did you stop? I don't know, you moved your leg or something. You want me to keep going? Yeah. Keep going. Don't stop. Like that. Yeah. Okay. Don't move. Don't stop. Oh, God! Oh, lord! Oh, Jesus! Fuck me! Fuck me! Ah, fuck you. Sam, hi, it's me. You don't need to pick up. I know you're busy, like, packing or something. Just calling to say "yea!" And, listen... I'm kind of in a situation. What? I finished. You did? Yeah. That was really good. What about you? Uh... Yeah, I'm fine. You sure? Yeah, yeah, I'm good. Oh, my mother asked about April again. Why is she so fixated on April? I'm sure it's economic. I can't leave then. I know. She's probably just trying to get a deal on rentals. Beat the June rush or something ludicrous. You wanna change the plan? No, I don't. Do you? No. I don't know why people get married in June anyway. I mean, what's wrong with January? I just never saw the reason to go out there. It's disruptive, in my opinion. Alex should be here to finish her dissertation and you should stay in Cambridge if you'll be practicing here. Well, I'd rather be in Cambridge, absolutely. But the Hausman institute is the best program in the country. I think you should reconsider psychiatry, Sam. It's a feeble discipline. If you're interested in brains, get to the thick of it. The gray matter. That's honest medicine. Why waste yourself on the hopeless? It's so impressive, Alex. The MD alone. It's a tremendous achievement. Then a PhD. Well, I haven't finished it yet. Genetics, my God! Genomics. Right, of course. Genomics. How long are you staying with your mother? We're not staying with her. Oh, I thought you were. No, no, no, we're staying at her house, but she's not living there now. She's an executive, isn't she? Uh, not exactly. She's, uh, in the entertainment industry. She's a record producer. That's right. Alex mentioned that once. Well, it seems you have everything under control. Definitely. We've covered everything. Think about my suggestion. Oh, and take care of Alex, please. We don't want her joining the scientologists or the vegetarians. You ready? Yeah. You can't leave now. We haven't had the cake! - "Q." - Beautiful. Thank you. You're behind by 40. You have to focus. I am focusing. No, you're not. You're distracted. No, I just don't read the dictionary, smarty-pants. Could I get another juice? Can I get another scotch, please? I don't think you should worry about it anymore, honey. I didn't plan on worrying about it at all. It's not that much time. Theoretically, yeah. Oh, God, I wish I had a Xanax. What did she say, a week? She wasn't specific. Thanks. Thank you. I don't know why you didn't call her back earlier. Neither do I. We could've made other arrangements, you know. I know. I don't know why I didn't call her back. I should have. Forty seven. * On a summer day * You can't hear her call * But in a funny way * She reminds you of the fall * On a summer day * You can't hear her call * But in a funny way * She reminds you of the fall * Through the fields and the streets * And the lakes and the trees * And the grass and the logs and all my dogs * And I am * Home again * In the autumn air * You can't see her smile * But in a funny way * She reminds you of a child * In the autumn air * Feel her soul unfold * And in a funny way * You feel your romance slow * Through the fields and the streets * And the lakes and the trees * And the grass and the logs and all my dogs * And I am * Home again * On a winter day * You can't hear her call * But in a funny way * The snow begins to fall * On a winter day * You can't hear her call * In a funny way * You love her even more Whose cars? I don't know. She's really weird, Al. I know, honey. You told me that before. I just wanna re-emphasize. Okay. It's probably a developmental disorder or something. Sam. Rarefied strain. Why are you telling me this again? I just don't want you to be surprised. It's temporary. I don't want you getting upset. Anyone's tolerable for a few weeks. Even the developmentally disabled. Come on. I need to pee. Hey! Hey! What time is it? God, look at you! Oh, man, you look great! Thanks. Really. So do you. Sorry. Alex, this is Jane, my mother. Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too, finally. It's a pleasure. Thanks. Likewise. Hello. I'm Ian. One of the crew. Ian, Dean, Rowan, Fripp. Hi. Hi. This is my son, Sam. And... Oh, Alex. Alex. God, I'm sorry. It's lovely to meet you, Alex. As well you, Sam. Yeah. Let's go outside for a second. Come on. * When you know she's no high climber it's this shit I hate, you know. I give them a gorgeous record and they come back with, "There's no single." No superlatives, no thank you's, no congratulations. Just "go back in and find it." Otherwise... I would not be behind like this. I'm never behind like this. Jane, you're always behind like this. No, I've changed. Truly, I have. Just take your time and finish the record. And we'll stay in Malibu, all right? No, you can't stay in Malibu. It's ok, it's for a couple of weeks. It's Bobby's. What do you mean, "It's Bobby's"? I gave the house to Bobby. You gave the house to Bobby. Just for a little while. Till he gets back up on his feet. He doesn't have feet. Bobby's a basket case. No, I gave him a deadline. Oh, I'm sure that'll motivate him. Look... It's complicated, okay. I feel a little guilty about this one. Yeah, what? I left him. So you gave him the house? It was the right thing to do. Why did you break up with Bobby? I thought Bobby was the real thing. Well, then I got to know him. What do you want to eat? Curry. We're going for a bite. Care to join us? No, thanks. We're exhausted. No? Our loss. Another time. See you, Jane. See you, baby. Bye. See you later. See you. See you in the morning. All right. Unless you wanna... See you in the morning. Nice to meet you. They don't have a single. I'm sorry. I thought Sam would've explained how things get. No. He just thought you'd be gone. I mean finished. Happens a lot in this business. Things shift, plans change, people get fired. Sure. Of course. Yeah, what are you gonna do? Things shift, plans change, people get fired. Yeah, we just hadn't planned on a change of plan. So... Well, who plans on a change of plan? I mean, that would be sort of paranoid, don't you think? Do you want something to drink? No, thanks. Look, I think you guys should stay as long as you want. Really, I want you to be comfortable. This has nothing to do with you. I'm really happy to have you here. Want some? No, thanks. I'm okay. Sam? She is so embarrassing. She's fine. She's amusing. Oh, yeah. Like a minstrel show. Come on. She's a little odd. Her presentation's a little odd. But I think she means well. I don't know what she means. In fact, I never have. You made it sound like she was autistic or something. She is, in a way. I mean, she makes the Same mistakes over and over. Well, she's obviously very accomplished. Yeah. The irony of all time. I'm sorry, Al. What are you sorry about? Bringing you here. I should've taken that spot at Mass General. Your dad was right. We should've stayed in Cambridge. I fucked up. Stop it. You didn't fuck up. Why didn't you tell me she was so successful? I told you. No. You've hardly told me anything about her. You hardly asked. That's not true. Sleep tight. All right. Do you think Sam likes me? No. Why would he? There's nothing to like about you. You're totally unlikable. Ow! You bitch! Wait. Come here, come here. Shit! I'm sorry. Did I wake you? No, not at all. I can't sleep lately. My clock is fucked. You don't have to do that. Carmella's coming on Friday. It's not a problem. Well, don't cut yourself. Hey, come on. I got it, really. You're barefoot. Hmm, why are you up? I got to be at the hospital. It's so early. Yeah, it's a real job. That's too bad. No, I don't feel bad about it. We should spend some time together. Yeah. With Alex. Yeah. She's sweet. I think so. Hey, I've got box seats at the Bowl. Maybe we could do that. The four of us? Get some wine, some weed, some chicken. The weather's been fabulous. Yeah. I probably won't have time for a while, but I'll let you know. Okay. But thanks for the offer. That sounds nice. Sure. That's your new guy? Uh-huh. How's it going? Great. Yeah? He's a beautiful man. I'm really happy. Yeah? We have a really deep connection. Probably deeper than I've had with anyone. Even Bobby. Wow! Didn't you have a deep connection with that guy... Randy? Randy? Yeah, Randy. The guy, the roadie with the limp. Lived here when I was 12? Ronny. Ronny. Yeah, I had a connection with Ronny. It wasn't particularly deep. What about Veronica? You got deep with her, didn't you? Veronica and I stopped having sex after the 3rd month. Anyway, Ian gets me. This is completely different. Well, that's great. That's great, Jane. Listen. Alex is, uh, working hard on her dissertation. And, um, I'd appreciate it if you could keep it low key while we're staying here. You know. Just keeping doors shut and stuff. Uh, I think she'd appreciate it. I want her to feel comfortable here. Yeah. So do I. You know, the situation's kind of foreign to her. She's used to working in a lab, or an office alone. She's not used to being around people. Well, she must get lonely. Okay. Okay. Come on, Claudia. I'm not gonna slap some bullshit together for radio. I don't work that way. You know that. I hear you, babe. It's all good. But there's a slot open now, and we need to jump, yo. I got to have all my elements in place for the holidays. We need to move units... Christmas? Fuck that. Oh, Claudia, please don't take me there. Please, don't depress me. I couldn't give a shit about Christmas. Fuck Christmas. This isn't Nat King Cole. You know that. You know what you got. Why are you up my ass? See, this is why we get into trouble with you, Jane. And this is why you always end up coming back to me, Claudia. God, I love that woman. Where are we? Two minutes. Okay. This is the locked ward, obviously. And these are the patients in the locked ward. Some of whom you'll be getting to know intimately very, very soon. How are you doing, buddy? I'm not stealing them! I took my medication. You're stealing my pieces. No, it's down your sleeve. It's in her sleeve. I appreciate it. I'll just... Sara Golan, 2nd-year resident extraordinaire. Meet the new recruits. Hello. - Hi. I think I'm bringing them down. Tell them it's not so bad. It's not so bed. You see? It's not so "bed." All right. Onward. Christmas. Slots and units. A limited universe. It's depressing, really. So up your Wellbutrin. I'd rather up my Vicodin. Move that unit, lady in the track suit. You know what I think? I don't, but I'm dying to. I think we made a beautiful record, and cowards notice last. You're very deep. You think so? I do. When you're not talking. Fuck off. I'm sorry. Here, let me turn it down. No, it's fine, really. So, what are you working on upstairs? Excuse me? You seem exceedingly absorbed. Oh, I'm writing. What, a novel? No, my dissertation. Oh, brilliant. What's it on? What's it on? You have a subject? Specifically? Yeah. We went to university. We can handle it. The genomic determinants of sexual behavior in the drosophila fruit fly and its implications for homo sapiens. Really? The sex life of flies. No, the reproductive behavior of the fruit fly. Excuse me. He didn't mean it, Alex. Honestly, he's got low self-esteem. He had acne as a child. You cunts. Hey. Hey. Yeah. There's not much in here. We've been doing takeout lately. Oh, that's okay. Is there a store nearby? Why don't you join us? Oh, no. Come on, seriously. Alex, you don't have to be polite with me. Polite isn't my thing. I'm sure Sam told you that. No, well, I wasn't being polite. I just, I should just get some air. Air's good. Always better than a cocktail at this hour. You're welcome to listen to the record sometime if you want. Oh. Sure. Yeah, I'd like to. I'd like that. Thanks. Hmm, well, you'd be helping us out. It's like a psychic sauna in there at this point. We're wasted. Well, I'd love to listen, but I don't think I'd be much help. I don't really know anything about popular music. Sure you do. Anyone with instinct knows about popular music. That's why it's popular. You strike me as someone with strong instincts. I guess so. Well, you know when you're repulsed, and when you're turned on, right? Um... I suppose so. In general, I guess. That's all it is. Either it pulls you in, or it leaves you cold. Sorry, you want some? It's great for the colon. Oh, no, thanks. They're definitely taking it. Okay, thank you. Hi. Yeah, I'm calling about the apartment. You did? Okay. All right, thanks. Everything all right? Yeah. Yeah. Oi! What'd you get? Uh, food. Good timing. I'm famished. Get on. No, I'm fine. I need the exercise. You'll have a heart attack dragging that load up the mountain. No, it's fine. Really. Jane asked me to get you, sweetheart. Get on. I promise I won't tell your parents. You really didn't have to get me, you know. I'm fine. Hold on to me. Tighter. So, where are you staying now? Up in Laurel Canyon. It's just that the house that we're in was supposed to be empty, but my mother is producing a record there. And she moved in because she left her boyfriend and she gave him her beach house because... Anyway, it's convoluted, and not very interesting. No, it's definitely interesting. It'll work out, really. It's more a logistics issue at the moment. Uh... That was you in the car, right? Yeah. You almost killed me. Well, yeah. I'm sorry. You should be. It was unbelievable. Every call I made, someone had just nabbed it. I'm fine staying here, honey. I don't mind. Really, I don't. She's in your way, Al, you know? I mean, she has no boundaries. You need your privacy. She's not in my way. I'm working in private. It's not a problem. What about the noise? They're respectful when the door's closed. What about when the door's not closed? Well, then it's open. Can you hear them? No, not really. "Not really," what is that? That's "yes," right? No. That means no, not really. Look, Al, don't get technical. I'm just trying to work it out. I'm just trying to help. You are? Yeah, I am. Ok, can she pick you up tomorrow? Yeah, she said she could. Okay, then I'll start looking. Well, good. That'll be good. Maybe we should look in the valley. It's cheaper and quieter. North Hollywood or something. * I love the girls and the money * And the shame of life Yeah, Mickey's here. Everybody's fucking here. Come over. I'm not talking about work, I've got a band with me. How you doing, Rowan? Hey. Hey! You didn't have to go out. We made tofu steaks. Oh, yeah? Sorry we missed that. What do you got there? Pizza. You want some? Lovely. Mmm, delicious. Real meat. Whose kid is that? That's Rowan's baby, China. Come here, you little heart breaker. You look cold. Meet my friend, Alex. Say hello. Hello. You want your dad? Yeah. Your dreadful dad. Can I get you two a drink? Sure. Hello? Hi, is Sam there? Sugar? Please, thank you. I'm really sorry I woke you up. No. I'm usually up before 6:00. I overslept. Morning. Sorry. Should we go? Well, Alex made coffee. Do we have time? I think so. I drive fast. Okay. Thanks for picking him up. I wasn't expecting to be apartment hunting. I mean, we weren't. It's not a problem. Really. I'm happy to. It's right on my way. That's convenient. Where do you live? In the valley. Oh. North Hollywood. Oh. Why can't you stay up here? It's a little tight with everyone. That's too bad. It's really nice. I'd sacrifice space to be up here any day. Are you a resident? 2nd year. Oh. What do you do? I'm writing my dissertation. What on? Drosophila genomics. She's an MD as well. Wow, that's very impressive. Not really. Oh, it impresses me. Thank you. You must have a lot of patience. I don't know, I couldn't imagine analyzing data all day. It seems so... Tedious. Well, it's not meaningless at all. No, no, I didn't say meaningless. Did I? My English is terrible. I'm sorry. I said tedious, I think. Well, same difference. But I didn't mean that. I meant... I don't know the word. Serious, that's all. It's fine. Sorry. I didn't mean to... No. No. I'm sorry. Really. I didn't mean the assault. Insult. We should probably go. Well, it was nice meeting you. You, too. Bye. Your girlfriend seems nice. Yeah. She was tired. She's usually more... She's usually different. A double degree. She must love school. Yeah. She got through fast. She's really smart. Yeah, she must be. Ambitious. Well, yeah. Top in our class, actually. Really? Yeah. How can you compete with that? Methamphetamines. Ecstasy. Generic. Ice. We're not sure what he took. Vital signs still haven't stabilized. I'll be around. Page me if you have any questions. Uh, you wanna start? No, he's yours. Okay. How you doing, Wyatt? I'm fucked up, okay. I've got these fucking Nazis in the parking lot waiting to fucking bang me, and I'm fucking trapped in here! Okay, how old are you? 18. You have any family around? No, I don't have any family around, you fucking asshole. Leave my fucking family out of it, you fucking paranoid Nazi freak in a fucking white coat! Leave my family out of it, okay? I need IM meds, 511 stat. Wyatt, sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Okay. What the fuck is 511, huh? What the fuck is that, huh? Is that a fucking code, huh? Is that a fucking code? Is that a fucking prison code? Is that a fucking prison code? Don't fucking take me out. Please, God, don't. Don't fucking take me out. Please don't. Please don't take me out. It's okay. I'm not feeling that. What's with the gallop? The tempo's shit. Yeah. I'm right. Right? Yeah. * I could not crawl back if I tried No. No. no. Let us get into it. It's got to have texture like, you know, like ooze. Sonic ooze. Sonic ooze. Okay, baby. How about a horn section? A little Tijuana brass maybe? I heard Herb's in town. Now, now. Let's not get patronizing. That's not patronizing. That was accommodating. I was accommodating you. Against my better judgment, even. * There's something going on around here * I could not crawl back if I tried * I couldn't wait around * I couldn't wait another second * There's something going on around here * I left my baby on the side of the highway * She just couldn't see things my way * So tell me why * The beautiful ones are always crazy * She's whisperin' like a mortician now * I left my baby on the side of the road * I left her with a heavy load * Someday * Someday * I will treat you good * You know I should Sweet. That's it. That's the direction. I've overplayed it. No, it's not the bass line. We got to straighten out the beat. It should be faster. No, I know what she's doing, sultry. She's going for romantic. Is that what you're going for, Jane? A love song? Come on! Let him go. No, let me at them! Oi, those are mine. - What are? - Your tits. You're such a brute. Hello. Hi! Am I interrupting? Absolutely not. It's an unexpected pleasure, really. We were just discussing romance. Come on in. Sit down. Come on. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. Have a good night. I'm really starting to love this. It's dated, you know? It's not dated. We just wrote it. It doesn't have a date on it yet. Why are you so contrary? 'Cause you wouldn't respect me otherwise. You think so? Babe, I know so. Good. I love a man who speaks his mind. Even when it's bullshit. Hey, stranger. Hey, you. Hey. What time did you come to bed last night? I tried to wake you. Really? You didn't move. I didn't even feel it. How'd it go yesterday? Hmm? With the apartments? Good. What's the status? I saw a few things. Most of them were pretty disgusting. Yeah. I think it's gonna take some time. I was sure there was something perfect in here just ready to rent. So how was work yesterday? Uh, strange. I had to deal with a 16-year-old having an ecstasy-induced psychotic episode and he thought I was a Nazi. How ironic. And upsetting. Yeah, he was pretty upset. This one looks good. Which one? This house, in the valley on Greenleaf. Right there. Okay. Were you, uh, in the studio for a long time? No, not too long. Just taking a break? Yeah. Did you get much work done? Yeah, I think they're pretty close to finishing. No. On your dissertation. Oh, yeah. It's going really well. Did you enjoy yourself? Where? In the studio. Yeah, I did actually. It was stimulating. Good. Jesus. I don't know how you two stand getting up so early. That would totally burn me out. Hello. Hi. You're right on time. Oh, he's very friendly. He's a pussycat. You see that? He likes you already. Come on in. I'll show you the house. I want you to take the gown out of your bag, Gloria, and put it on. This isn't appropriate for public. You don't understand naked. Naked is inner. I am here with you. There is no shame. There is no separation. And... I'm not ill. Yes, you are ill, Gloria. And I have no need for a green synthetic nightie, used to conceal the essence of my supple skin and my aching soul in the barren desert that is this land. I'm moving in with my son in Costa Mesa. He thinks I'm lonely. Truth is, he's lonely. Sweet kid. Just can't seem to connect. Me and my wife lived here 40 years. It's lovely. Really. It's really lovely. You seem like a very nice person. I hope you take the place. * Been 40 days since I don't know when Come on. * I just saw her with my best friend * Do you know what I mean Come on, baby! Pussy! * I just saw her yesterday I don't know about trust. Maybe she just needed a nap or something. Believe me, she's been belligerent with everybody else. I dealt with her last year. I just listened to her, really. Yeah. Well, listening it's better than medicating, no matter what they tell you. Can I tell you something? Yeah. Sure. Hi. Hi. Hi, how are you? Fine thanks, you? Fine. Thanks. Did I leave you enough room? Oh, yeah. Yeah. See you in the morning. * Do you know what I mean Another day at the office. * Do you know what I mean All right. Hey. How's it going? Good. You? Okay. Hey, come on in the water. It's delicious. Uh, maybe later. Thanks. Well, you're always welcome. In fact, more than welcome. Obviously you're welcome. Bloody hell, it's your house. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. Just someone else got there first. The house was gone. You know, it wouldn't be the worst thing to stay here a little longer. It's comfortable. Well, depends on your definition of comfort. I mean, Al, I'm hardly ever here. It's not for me, it's for you. Is it? Can you give me some lemonade? I'll see if there's some around. How did you sleep? I don't know. Whatever you hit me with took me down, man. I feel fucking drugged. Yeah? Well, you were drugged. I don't like downers. Well, you weren't liking the uppers either. Yeah. I told you not to call my house. Look, I had to contact your family, Wyatt. You're underage and that's the law. My mom's gonna kick my ass. I mean, she's freaking now, but she's gonna torch my fucking ass when I get out of here. Why are things so wrong with your mom? I don't know. You seem like you do. She just doesn't get me, all right? She's in my face about my grades, my hair, my friends, tattoos, and all this other shit, you know? I can't do nothing right, so... Why should I care? * I left my baby on the side of a highway * She just couldn't see things my way * Someday Fuck! What? I missed the punch. I fucked up. Mickey, sweetheart, would you just keep that to yourself next time, huh? Let him play it through? Let me talk to him. Sorry. Yeah, it's not quite there, but that's the direction. Was that okay? Yeah, oh, we'll finesse it in the mix. We'll make it work. What do you think? Truthfully? No, lie to me. Yeah, truthfully. I'm not feeling it. You're not feeling it. I'm sorry. No, it's okay, don't apologize. Just tell me what you mean. Well, I don't know what I mean exactly. I just, I mean I... I guess it's just not pulling me in. Or it feels like it's not pulling them in... Exactly... Or enough. I don't know. Um... They don't seem inspired. Inspired? Hmm. Yeah? - Progress report. Excuse me? "Progress report"? No "hello, how are you?" Jesus, Claudia. You're really warming me up. What? I love capitalism as much as the next guy, Claudia, but this is off the charts. Your commerce is so far up my ass, I can't even sit up straight. Listen, Jane. The age of Aquarius never happened, okay? Get real. This is commerce. I'll tell you something, Claudia, for the good of your own soul. Pushing for Christmas and radio play will never amount to anything but a lot of shit in wrapping paper. I promise. I don't know what happened, Jane, you know. We really used to be on the same page. I don't know what happened either, Claudia. I guess you started exercising. Got to go. Bitch. Cunt. Can we just say how lovely Jane looks today? Can we just have a moment of appreciation for our sweet, lovely Jane. Jane rocks. Get the fuck out of my chair. I had a math teacher in high school who was sort of my mentor. You know, I was one of those science geeks, and my mother wasn't really around, so, he took me under his wing, and he convinced me that I should be a doctor. Which seemed like the right idea at the time. So, I guess I needed to, uh, prove myself. To who? Who are you trying to prove yourself to? I don't know. My math teacher. Your math teacher? You got through Harvard medical school for your math teacher? Yeah. No. I guess I was trying to prove myself to myself. You know, I needed to prove that I wasn't a loser. A loser? Why would you think you were a loser? I was around a lot of losers growing up and, uh, not... The worthless type loser, or, uh, you know, a bad person, just... Just lost. People at loose ends. And I didn't want to be that. I wanted to be anything but that. You're everything but that. I set up a meeting with his mom. It's not protocol, but I think it'll help. Is he still violent? No. No, he was never violent. Oh, I thought you had to restrain him. No, I sedated him. Oh, I thought he was psychotic. Huh? No. He had a psychotic episode. He OD'd on methamphetamines but, he's not psychotic in general. Oh. When did you start reading Spin Magazine? I'm not really reading it. What, are you just looking at it? Oh, skimming it. Is it helping? Yeah, it's, uh, it's informative. A different overview. Like a primer? Yeah, something like that. Getting the basics. A light survey of popular culture. Are you teasing me? No. What, should I be reading the Journal of Medicine or the Harvard Review? No. Would that be more appropriate? Or something more scholarly. No, come on, Al, I was... I was teasing. 'Cause, you know, I could harass you about those porno magazines, but I didn't even bring it up. What... Come on. I don't care about the porno magazines. I just didn't know you liked jugs. Oh, God. Sorry I don't have enormous breasts. Please, stop it. Your breasts are fine. Your breasts are perfect. Really. Yeah, but who's had 72 lovers? Where did you come up with that fucking number? I'm guessing from what you said. Well, I'm 16 years older than you. That's a lifetime of fucking. And I am not apologizing. My past isn't about you. Oh, that is cold. No, it's not. It's clear. You're gonna keep me in my place, are you? I'm not gonna keep you anywhere. You are free to move around. Well, I'm not moving, for your information. You can keep working your tough girl thing, Jane, but I know you're madly in love with me. That's irrelevant. * Do I ever wonder * More than words can say * Heaven knows it's hard enough to pray * Let me tell you something * There's a change in me * Even now you're gone, you'll always be I'm kind of... Tired, baby. You know. * My only love You're up early. I know. I'm not happy about it. You need some valium? No. I don't wanna get back into that shit again. Yeah, that wouldn't be good. Try swimming. It helps. So, how are you? How's work going? Good. Just not sleeping enough myself. Yeah, I'm sure. Hospital's been busy. A lot of psychos, huh? No, just a lot of... Pained souls. Listen, I appreciate your interest in Alex. I meant to tell you that. I really like Alex. I like her a lot. She's smart. Yeah. I know I was a little protective of her when we first got here. I just, wasn't sure how she was gonna deal with... Your scene. I think she's dealing just fine with my scene. Yeah. I think she likes it. I mean, obviously! She's getting stoned with you and she's reading Spin. I don't read Spin. I've never read Spin. Anyway. Look, she found her own way into the studio. It had nothing to do with me. Yeah. It's always like that with you, isn't it? They... They always just happen to, uh, find their way in. What's that supposed to mean? It means you're charmed, that's all, just... Someone's looking out for you. Nobody's looking out for you? I'm sorry. Come on. Your life looks pretty good from my perspective. Well, I've worked for what I have. And I haven't? You are so stuck on the negative. I'm not stuck on the negative. Yes, you are. It's like you've completely blocked out all the fun we used to have. I haven't blocked it out. It's all filed. Oh, what about the trip to Vera Cruz? Yeah. When Ronny went to jail? No, no, before that. When we were out on his boat. In the storm? Yeah. That was fun? That sucked! No, it didn't. It was exciting. Even you thought it was exciting at the time. I wasn't excited. I was hysterical. There's a huge difference between hysteria and excitement. Are we ever gonna have a relationship? We're having a relationship. Here we are, having it. Look, Ian's got a room at the chateau. We'll go stay there for a while, and you can have the place to yourself. No. You should just stay. I mean, Alex is still looking for an apartment, and... We need something permanent anyway. So you should just stay. Why don't you ask her? Maybe she wants to be alone in the interim. I'm sure Alex wants you to stay. I mean, she can't stay away from you as it is. Oh! He's gonna give her a frontal lobe. No, he'll just give her thorazine and lock her up. I think she wants to be locked up. Yeah, exactly. Make your analysis at first with three general patterns of emotional response. Rage is the response to the primary stimulus of thwarting. Should I be embarrassed for us? I am. You gonna have another? You know, I should probably go. Oh, come on, Golan. How often do you get a night and a morning off? ...experiences. They respond with various emotions. I'd stay for another. Okay. And the emotional response to love, is usually the result of a show of affection or favor. Tom, can I use your phone? Yeah. It's, uh, it's right in there. ...the emotions with which we start... I think we'd do really well together. Absolutely. For a while. Oh. Will you get past the cynicism? I just broke up with somebody, baby. Oh. I thought you forgot all about him. Hello? Al? Who are you with? Just some of the residents. Oh. I'd like to leave, but, um, Sara's driving, and I don't wanna be rude. Later Cassandra was found in a back alley... You wanna come down? No, I'll see you when you get home. All right. ...adequate facilities for handling addiction cases. Cassandra was here committed to the ward assigned for the mentally ill. You're ageist. That's what it is. Oh, please. Then what are you afraid of? Breaking your heart. Running your ass into the ground, buddy! Bollocks. Then why do you wanna ruin this with domesticity? Because I've never met a braver woman. And I'm deeply, deeply attached to you. Looks like we've got company, you know. Hmm. How you doing, Alex? Okay, I think. Getting some work done? No. Not tonight. Where's Sam? Out. What, without you? Well, I didn't want to go. So, pour yourself a drink. Spend some time with us. Yeah, go up, get a drink, and come back out. Are you sure? She's sure. I'm positive. I'll have another whisky sour while you're at the bar. So will Jane. Cheers! Ah! Tasty, eh? It's a good combination. Ah, you made it perfectly. You should be a bartender. You wanna come in? No, that's okay. You sure? Yeah, I'm okay. Oh, have you just washed your hair? No, I haven't. So? So, I just don't wanna get wet. Really? You seem like you do. Cut it out. What? She wants to swim. She's afraid to get wet. I'm not afraid. Oh! Ow! You little tart! Come on. You've had it. Oh, shit! God, what... I can't believe you! See what I have to put up with? It's not so bad, is it? Yeah, it's freezing. That's 'cause your clothes are wet, silly. You really are a jackass, God. Oh, no name-calling, now. We're all adults here. * Ain't got nothing at all * Sweet nothing That's better, isn't it? Well, it's definitely warmer. I'm sure. I'd much rather be in here than out there in that cold world. You're so polite, Alex. It's okay to leave the ivory tower and live a little. Fight back! Ow! * He will let you up * But he'll let you down * Sweet nothing * You ain't got nothing at all Yes, I can drive. Well, you shouldn't. You're drunk. I'm not drunk. I drank less than you. No, you did not. Well, you wanna kill me again? I didn't kill you the first time, did I? Oh, shit. God damn it, you're flustering me. Turn it to the right. I know how to open a door. Apparently you don't. Give me a break, I'm drunk. You should let me drive. Get in. Sara. Yeah? I think we should take the high road. What would that be? Sublimation. Oh. Is that okay? It's intellectual. I know. Not very honest. Well... Not very satisfactory. Satisfying. I think you know what I mean. Al? Hey. Al? You up? Huh? You up? I am now. Can we talk? Okay. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm just, uh... Wondering about something. Okay. Why does your father hate psychiatrists? He doesn't hate psychiatrists. Okay, so... Why does he hate me? He doesn't hate you. What are you talking about? He thinks you're great. Why are you so concerned about what my father thinks suddenly? You know, he's a puritan. He quotes Proust and wears tweed. He doesn't know anything about us. Do you think that we should've gotten married before? Before when? Before coming out here? He runs around with low-class people. He spends all my money on drugs. And ends up in a mental hospital! Well, I'm so close to letting go on him. I'm at the end of my rope here. I think that what's going on with Wyatt is complicated. And I don't think that your anger is helping him with his problems. My anger? I'm not angry. I'm furious! Because this is all about me, you see. It's all about me. And I will not tolerate this disgusting, degenerate behavior and disrespect for me and my values and what I stand for. Mrs. Jones, listen. Give your values a rest for a second. Your kid's in trouble. * May your shade be sweet * And float upon the lakes * May your shade be sweet Yeah. Oh, Jesus, Claudia. Give me a fucking break. No, my relationship with Ian has nothing to do with this. It's none of your business anyway. No, it is not slowing anything down. These conversations are slowing us down. I can't believe I'm listening to this. That was totally patronizing. Claudia. It's Ian McKnight. Lovely, thanks. Listen, I don't know why you're so fascinated with our sex life, but for the record, Jane's an amazing shag. Right, well, more to the point, we're just about done with your single. And I'm sure you'll be orgasmic when you hear it. So let's give the telephone a little rest till then, shall we? Cheers. Great. You're a fucking diplomat. This is it. It's going to hell. Oh, fuck her. Who the fuck cares? We'll take it somewhere else. Okay. You hire a lawyer. That's how I wanna finish. What, with a lawsuit? No. With that song. Which song? The song I just played you. It's a ballad. So what? You want me to hand them a ballad? That's right. You're kidding, right? Tell me you're fucking kidding. No, I'm not fucking kidding. Alex was right. Alex was right? The other song doesn't pull you in. It pulled me, it pulled me right across the room. I'm serious. Is this about Alex? No. Alex doesn't know anything about this. She's into flies and domination. Determinism. Ian. Jane. Ian! Do you like it? Jane? What? Did you? Yeah. Yeah? I said I did. Well, all right then. Let's just finish the record, darling. I can't stand to watch Claudia wank you off any longer. It's starting to make me jealous. * I could look in your face * For a thousand years * It's like a civil war * Of pain and of cheer * If you was a horse * I could help you with your chains * I could ride you through the fields * By your fiery mane * May your shade be sweet * And float upon the lakes * Where the sun could be * Made of honey * I'd cry diamonds while you burn * 'Cause no one here can save you Oh, God, sorry. Excuse me. Hello, Sam? Hold on one second. I'm just gonna... Hey. Hello. Huh, where? No, I can't hear you. Oh. There are a lot of people there? Yeah. I guess like 15, 20 or so. Uh, shrimp cocktail and something else. No, I didn't see any crab cakes. Do you wanna come up? No, I probably won't. No, no, stay. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. Okay. I will. I promise. Were you trailing me? Maybe. Why didn't you catch up to me? Sara. I was sublimating you. You're not meant to be in a band, you know? You're meant to work in a bank. Everything else is happening. I'm not usually so aggressive. I don't believe that. I'm not. I just, um... I don't really know you, uh, I... I just feel connected to you. I feel... I feel safe with you. Like it's okay to be honest. It's just one of those things. I'm just attracted to you. And it's not just because I think you're incredibly sexy. I think that you're incredibly attractive, too, Sara. I do. You do? Yeah, I think about you. Trust me. A lot. How do you think about me? How? Yeah. Do you think about having sex with me? Yeah. How? How do I think about having sex with you? Yeah. Do you think about me going down on you? Yeah. That's... That's part of it. Yeah, me too. I think about how you'd taste. I'm sure you'd taste sweeter. Do you resist me? No. Do you give yourself over? Yeah. Completely? Completely. Mmm. That gets me off. You're easy. No. With you I am. So, do I get to... Do I get to work on you for a while or... Or do we just fall asleep? You can work on me all night long. I mean, you're with someone. Why would I let myself fall in love with you? Oh, what, like I'm... I'm just an object to you? I'm just like a piece of ass? You just looking to get laid? Yeah. Right. God! You're like a girl. Oh, thanks. That's... That's really flattering. Yeah, it is. Maybe that's why I like you. Are you having a sexuality crisis? No. I'm not having any kind of crisis. You're lucky, you know that? No. I don't know that. Why am I lucky? You can control your heart. Hey, thanks for coming up, Darla. Good night. Thank you. It sounds amazing. Thanks. I'll get the rest this week. Yeah, no problem. Good night. Hello? Yeah, it's Ian in the penthouse. We need another bottle of Chateau Marmont. Oh, sorry, uh, Dom Perignon. Cheers, thanks. I think it's more comfortable inside. I think it's one of the best records I've done. I think it's the best record you've done, too. I didn't say, "the best." She said "the best," didn't she? I thought she said the last. You see? You save the best for last. I know it's not the last. No, don't go. Don't go. You should get some sleep. No, we never sleep. Why have you got your clothes on? What are you talking about? You look so much better with them off. Come here. We've been entertaining you for a while. So why don't you entertain us? What do you want me to do? Finish it. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, look. You give her an inch, she takes a mile. I think we should stop. Oh, babe. Come on. Not now. Hey, I'm sorry. No, you're right, I, uh... I did... I didn't, uh... Oh, God. Sorry. Can I talk to you for a second? You should be with her if you want to. I don't want to be with her. I want to be with you. I want you to be with her. I can't be with her. But why not? She's Sam's girlfriend. So what? They're about to break up. I mean, it's obvious. She's throwing herself at us. Well, I don't know where she's throwing herself, but I can't do it. Oh, Jane! Look, I've done some weird shit in my life, and I'm glad I have. Because I have enjoyed 99 percent of it. But I'm not gonna screw my son's girlfriend. And I'm not gonna lay there and watch you do it either. Oh, who's gonna know? I'll know. Hey, what took you so long? Sorry. Still crushing the grapes. Back here. Is everything all right? Yeah. Sort of. Put it right there. No worries. Oh. Is this the party? What are you doing here? You're a sick pig, you know that? Nothing, nothing... You're a fucking greedy punk. Okay, mate, slow down. Who the fuck do you think you are? Sam, stop it! Get the fuck off me, you nutso! Stop it! You cunt! Jesus Christ. Sam, stop it. Oh! What are you doing? What am I doing? What the fuck were you doing? Are you all right, darling? Oh. Oh, shit! It's not what you think it is. You have so lost your shit! It's not her fault. It's my fault. No, it is my fault. It's not my fucking fault! You're not getting away with this. What am I not getting away with? Shutting me out! Oh, for Christ's sake, you're gonna reduce it to that? Jesus! Get some therapy finally, please! Get some help! You get some therapy. I'm not the one who needs it. Oh, that's exactly your problem. My problem? You're unbelievable! This is why I'll never come back here again. Something always spins out of control with you. You're like a two-year-old. Like a fucking infant! How did you get to be so rigid? At least I'm living in reality. At least I have some fucking dignity! Dignity? Jesus! Why are you so afraid? Afraid? What are you talking about? You're insane! Jane? I'm sorry, can I ask you to step outside? Fuck you, Phillip! I'm sorry. Can I get you some ice? Yes! I know, I know. It was my fault. It just happened. Things like this don't just happen, Alex. You got out of bed with my... I didn't sleep with her. I just kissed her. Oh, no details! Not one fucking detail. I don't know what happened. I got caught up. I got confused. Confused? Psychotic is more like it! I didn't think, I... I didn't think, I... I never learned... Learned what? This! "This"? What is "this"? How to fuck up! Oh, you fucking mastered it out of the gate! It didn't mean anything to me! I don't want... I don't want them! I don't feel anything for them. And I don't want them. I don't want either of them. I want you! I want to be with you, you fucking asshole. You fucking stupid, fucking asshole! Stupid asshole? I'm fucking keeping this together. I'm fucking trying to keep this together. I wanna make it right. How're you doing? You all right? Yeah, okay. I, uh... I wanted to apologize. Oh, no. We finished with that sorry business already. I'm sorry for getting you into this situation. No, you didn't get me into anything. I got myself into what we got into. I was just curious about you. And I you. You're the least likely person in the world for me. Are you insulting me now? No. No. Not at all. Oh, a compliment. I think you helped me. Okay. A little positivity. Yeah, you helped to open me up. Yeah, I would've opened you up further if I had my way. That's disgusting. No, not really. It's honest. You should work on your manners. I know. I'm trying. Believe me. I want to tell you something. All right. It doesn't matter who's right or wrong. I made mistakes. A lot of them, I know that. I live with them every day. But I think the hardest thing I live with really is knowing how much I've disappointed you. I haven't been a very good parent. I know that. I fucked up. But I've always loved you. You're my baby, man. Hello? Uh, yeah. May I say who's calling? You've got a lovely accent, Sara. Very compelling. Where are you from? Oh. What a coincidence. I'm eating a bagel right now. Hang on. It's Sara from Israel for you. Hey. Hi. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just taking a mental health day. Oh. How is your mental health? Haven't quite gotten to mine yet, I'm... I'm still dealing with everyone else's. It's not true, that thing you said last night. What thing I said last night? That thing about my heart. It's not true at all. I can't control my heart. I mean, I wouldn't want to, even if I could. Sara? Yeah. Can I call you right back? Yes. * I could look in your face * For a thousand years * It's like a civil war * Of pain and of cheer * If you was a horse * I could help you with your chains * I could ride you through the fields * By your fiery mane * May your shade be sweet * And float upon the lakes * Where the sun could be * Made of honey * I'd cry diamonds while you burn * 'Cause no one here can save you * She's returning to the earth * But one day she'll be silver * Scars are dying in my chest * Till I see you again * She was born with the wings of a hawk * Now she combs her hair with its blood * May your shade be sweet * And float upon the lakes * Where the sun could be * Made of honey * May your shade be sweet * And float upon the lakes * Where the sun could be * Made of honey * May your shade be sweet * May your shade be sweet * And float upon the lakes * May your shade be sweet
