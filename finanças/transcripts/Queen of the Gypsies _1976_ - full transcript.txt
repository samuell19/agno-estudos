You can feel in the air a moisture like in the grave. Smells like this from six months. Ciudra! Why did you left the family? Gipsies are not like they used to be... Now they trade their horses for gold. And their soul... Who knows more?? The dumb or the wise? The dumb. The wise is not suer about anything. It's better to be dumb. Too much thinking brings lots of trouble. What advice can you give me if we won't meet again? Don't love money. Money dissapoint you. Don't love women too. They will trade you. From all the drinks, freedom is the sweetest. Wake up in the morning and don't forget: life ends when you don't expect. I wish you a long life. And die when the right time comes.

And I will share all with you. I am very rich... Why are you quiet? Answer, girl! What do you have to say? Welcome, rich man! Come to your sense, rich man! Is there place for me in your nest for doves? I thought a lot before I came here for the third time. You shouldn't come. Farewell and goodbye! - Where are you going? - To the end of the world. - Why? - To have a place from where to come back. What kind of people are you? What do you need? Nothing. Except roads... Let's go! Don't be upset! Time will heal you. Curse you! Until the end of your days, curse you, with your blood! Forgive him, Lord! Where are the drummers? I assisted to an execution in Magdeburg. An unforgiven show. Like a crown-ation. Here at us everything is so bad and cheap. Nothing can amaze these places. This happens in the country. Even places' names are written with grammar mistakes. Town's beauties put grease of the goose in their hair. Mr mayor, are we reading the sentence? Why? We're not executing Copernic, but a bastard! Leave me alone! Mr mayor, forgive him! Take her away! No! Show mercy! Forgive him! - Stop sneezing! - Yes, siri! I won't sneeze anymore. Bastards! To stop annoying you with his sneeze, let me hang myself. Ok! Step aside! - What is your command? - Finish this faster! Come on, sweetie! Do you want soap? It will be easyer! Keep it for you! Mr mayor! - What is this? - I don't know! - Who brought him? - I don't know! - Take him away! - Yes, sir! Take the ugly horse away! Shooti! Come on, Bubulea! You stuffed and lickers! Vegetarians! Good Lord! Forgive my sinful soul! Bubulea! Zobar! Crush him, Ciudra! I brought you the white mare! Zobar! Look at this, Zobar! Kako su se slozile! We were four. The whole world belonged to us. Two were killed. Looks like Talimon was swollowed by the earth. It's my turn... Look! It's just me in your way. There's the road! This is you. And everywhere is me. What an expensive pipe! It's from a Polish rich man who said I'm a girl made of gold. In your family you give your eyes for gold. - Two of you came to us. - Two bastards. And what if I'm made from gold? You love yourself so much... Who do you want me to love? Will be there someone to love me until I will forget myself? - Stop smoking! - Why? In front of the holy saints, it's not good. Why are they holy? They suffered, as long as they lived. I suffer much. You know how much... Am I a saint too? Light the fire, to dry ourselves. DOn't look at me! I am getting dizzy. I never loved anybody, never... But I love you! I also love freedom, I love it more than I love you. Ne mozes ti bez mene da zivis kao sto...I can't live without you... You will be mine with body and soul. I will fall in the trap of your words. It's hopeless to resist. I just get deeper. Only by ripping it I can escape. What should I do then? Are you blind, Zobar? In the world, everywhere, everibody, spreads his trap as they can. SOme, with talent, others, sneakyer. You can't avoid the one which is set for you. My touch is waiting for you. My touch for you will be like the fire. My whispers will make you to forgive it all. ANd tomorrow, you will be in your knees in front of me And, in the front of the family, you will kiss my right hand. And then I will be your wife. a onda ce doci nasa noc when I will come to you and we will born again, Luicu. Come closer! The fire from my love will remain in your mind and your heart... Drink! DOn't be afraid of me! Some time ago I was prouder than Rada. Where is Rada? Rada left. In the sunrise, the family hit the road. And you, why are you here? I stay until the first snow falls To grab herbs for cures. Which way did they left? TO the pass. Will settle in front of the oak. Lost! Everything is lost! Your suffering is in vain! I will give you to drink a potion to forget Rada. Zobar! You're going to your death! - What do you want? - Nothing. I will rest and leave. Darn! Today everybody rests without drinking! What's wrong with you, Zobar? Are you upset? Wash your face! Wake up! Inn-keeper! Rope four barrels with the saddle! - Right away, Zobar! - Today we have a party! Drink, my gipsies! Be my (caller for bride)! Did you forgot my words? I told you to lock your heart and mouth and pride with three seals. The seals are broken. Take me to her! You're good in driving horses. You make them obey you loke little lambs. That's right. Danilo! Give me the girl to be my wife! Take her! If you can... What is written for you it's on your forehead! It's not a horse to help you to run from your fate. I swear to take you as my bride, Rada, In front of your father, your brothers and our sisters. You caught her... We will see who cought who! Be careful, Rada. I'm a free man! And from now I will live how I like. Let's see how strong you are. Zobar! Stop it! What's wrong with you? You're strong on the saddle, and weak on the ground. He's my best friend. Why are you doing this? Get lost! Last night I looked deep in my soul And I understood that's it's over with free life that lasted until now. In my heart it's room just for Rada. I will fall in my knees, just like she wanted. Let everibody see how Zobar was enslaved by her beauty. Don't leave! Stay and see how I bow before her. - You talk too much, Zobar! - Don't hurry! This is how it is, brothers. Give me your hand! Your hand! Not like that, Zobar! In your knees and kiss my right hand! - GIve me your hand! - I don't want to! I knew this... Danilo! No! I'm sorry... I didn't want...
