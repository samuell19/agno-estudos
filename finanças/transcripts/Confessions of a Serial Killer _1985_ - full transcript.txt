My car just died on me and I don't know what to do. - I'll be glad to have a look at it for ya. - Oh gosh, would you? I'd be so grateful. I just don't know what's wrong with it. Well let me show you what it does. - [Daniel] All right. [engine revs] [woman scoffs] - I can't get over it. I mean, it sounds all right now. Well, thanks. I guess I'll go on while it's runnin'. - Don't bother, I'll get it for ya. [ominous music] - Oh damn. There it goes again. [engine turning over] - Sounds like you got carburetor trouble. No, there's nothin' I can do to fix that. Be glad to give ya a ride to the nearest gas station. - Well, I don't know. - Suit yourself. It's late, ya know. Could be out here all night. I could just make a phone call for ya. - Well, if it won't cause you too much trouble, I'll go ahead and catch a ride to the first open gas station or whatever. [ominous music] It looks like you've been on the road for quite a while. - Yes, ma'am, I have. - So have I. I left Chicago yesterday morning. Been driving ever since. I'm moving to San Antonio. I start a new job there next Wednesday. Look, if you'll just let me out here I can walk over to that place. Look, my boyfriend and I are planning to be married in three months. Please. I'll give you money. I'll give you anything and I promise I won't say a word to anyone. Please. Just let me go. [crying] - Okay. Sorry I took ya so far outta your way. It's just that I was kinda hopin' maybe, you know. I'll take you back to that place. - No, just let me out here. - All right. [handle rattling] [woman whimpering] - I promise, I won't say anything. [woman cries out] [woman grunting] [Daniel grunting] - Listen, Hawkins. I've been patient so far. Now I'd hate like hell to get tough with you, but the only way this is going to work is if you cooperate with us. And one way or another you will cooperate. Who was she? Did ya know her? Okay look, if ya don't wanna talk about her, why don't you tell me about some of the others. Look, I am sick of playing around with you. I wanna know about the girl, Hawkins, now. I want an answer from you, Hawkins. Ya know I could rough up a sorry asshole like you in a big hurry. Maybe then you'd have somethin' to tell me. - What do ya think, Will? - [Detective Barnes] You think you're a real tough guy, don't ya? - Not gonna get anything out of him that way. [door clicks] Why don't you boys get yourselves a cup of coffee. You can take those things off of him. And get us a couple cheeseburgers and fries. You like chocolate shakes? - Yes, sir. - Get us a couple large. - [Detective] Okay. - Go ahead and have one, that's what they're there for. My name's Gaines. What do you go by? Daniel? Daniel Ray? - Don't make no difference. - Well, Daniel, I thought you wanted to talk to us. Isn't that what you told the judge during your arraignment? Well, you gonna talk to me or not? - I'll talk to ya, but not the rest of 'em. I ain't talkin' to nobody that's gonna treat me bad. - Fair enough. So, Daniel, let's start over again. They read you the rights didn't they? - Yes, sir. - [Will] You want me to get you a lawyer? - Don't need one. - Okay. So, what's this you told the judge about killin' all these other people? - It's true, I did. - [Will] You said there were 50, I think. Did you really mean that? - Yes, sir. Gonna be more probably. Maybe 100. - Well Daniel, that's a whole lotta people. Just when'd you do all that? - Just all the time. - Do you remember the first person you ever killed? - [Daniel] Yes, sir. - Who was it? - I don't know. [chuckles] Never asked their name or nothin'. - [Will] When did it happen? - 20 some odd years ago. - [Will] How old were ya? - About 15. [upbeat honky-tonk music] [women chattering] - Yeah. I'm checkin' [mumbles]. - [Daniel] Went down to where the whores was 'cause I wanted to have sexual relations. Never had done anything like that before, but I knew where they was 'cause I'd seen 'em. - Hey, daddy. - Come on, daddy. - [Daniel] Somethin' about all of 'em together the way they was I didn't like, so I kept goin'. Then I saw this one looked real good start to leave. [upbeat honky-tonk music] [bell ringing] I got outta the car and followed her. [train whistle blowing] She stopped when she heard me followin' her and asked me what I want. I couldn't say nothin' to her. It was kinda like I was scared. She knows the whole time what I want. She just laughs and called me a creep she didn't wanna touch. - Tell 'em I [mumbles]. Now get lost. - Next thing I know I pick up this stick and start for her. It's like somethin' inside just pushin' me. [dramatic music] [wood thuds] [woman screams] And then she stopped movin' and I knew she was ready. But she made so much noise I was scared so I ran. [soft ominous music] Got back to my car and left. It was real excitin' to me. Had to pull over and do sex with myself just from thinkin' about it and all. - Do you know for a fact you killed her? - Yeah, pretty sure. - Where? - [Daniel] Scranton. - Scranton, Pennsylvania? - [Daniel] Yeah. - Remember when, the date? - It'd be 1960. July I think it was. - That's all right, we'll check it out. Did you tell anybody else about this? - No, I just went home and never said anything about it. - [Will] Who lived with ya at home? - Mother and sister. - [Will] No father? - Well... - What? - I was just thinkin' back about all that. - [Will] Why don't you tell me about it? [soft eerie music] [men chattering] [mother laughing] - [Daniel] Daddy was hurt in the war so he'd be with us all the time. - Go sit down. Go on down there. Gonna make us some drinks. - I can remember Mom bringin' in roughnecks - Hi, how ya doin'? - [Daniel] from the oil fields. I could tell Daddy was different when they was there. [mother mumbling] I didn't like 'em. [men chattering] - Look out, woohoo, baby! - [Daniel] She'd do the same thing each time. Start 'em drinkin' then do sex with 'em right there in front of us. [men chattering] Lots of times they'd treat her rough, but she didn't care, she liked it. [gun fires] I remember the blood and all, but I didn't really know what it was all about until I was older. - And you figure that's why you kill, huh? - Somethin' like that. Anyways, I don't wanna talk about it. - What do you wanna talk about? - Well I was thinkin' about this little gal, picked up about six years ago? Right around here. - [Will] Who was she? - I don't know, just some hitchhiker. ♪ Lyin' on the road - [Daniel] I had this favorite cruisin' spot. Them college girls would get out hitchhikin' at night and get stuck a lot of times. - Hey, how ya doin'? - [Daniel] I'm headin' towards Corpus. - Oh great. - I'll have to get that for ya. - [Girl] Okay. [soft ominous music] - Sometimes this old door is kinda stubborn. There it is. - Um, thanks anyway, but I have changed my mind. It's so late, I'm really tired. I think I'm just gonna go on back and spend the night in Waco. Oh God, no! [girl whimpering] No. [breathing raggedly] No, no, no. [girl grunting] [stick snapping] [girl gasps] [girl whimpering] [Daniel mumbling] [screams] No! No. Oh my God, help! Stop, stop, help me. Help! Please stop, help please! Help, stop it! Help! Help me, please help me! [screams] He'll kill me. - Get on the other side! - [Girl] Help, help me. - Honey, what is it? - Go, let's go! Let's go. [screams] [flashlight thuds] Go! Go, go! God, go, he's coming! Hurry! Go! - Yeah, never had no trouble with any hitchhiker 'cept that one time. Once they was in my car they was mine. [knuckles tapping] - Yeah, come in. - Sheriff, I've got your hamburgers. - Yeah, just sit 'em down. I'll be back in just a minute. Get on the horn and get Doc Spivey over here. I want him to see some of this. - Ya think he's certifiable? - I don't know about this one. You've told me now about several women you picked up, but so far only one of 'em's gotten away. - [Daniel] There were others. - Then I'm curious about somethin'. How come you never caught for any of 'em? - [chuckles] Well that's easy. I stuck to the highways. Hell, one year I put nearly 60,000 miles on one car. Sure, they mighta got away, but I was long gone by the time they got to any policeman. That reminds me of this one time, now somewhere, Louisiana I think. I remember I was drinkin' pretty good that night. [upbeat honky-tonk music] - Look, well I can dance with who I want to, when I want to. - Listen to me.

[woman screams] Was a good thing old Moon was with me. No tellin' what mighta happened. [woman screaming] [bones crunching] Anyway, Moon busted her neck and we each did her once. Then we threw her out in a field real close by. [soft ominous music] Don't know what her name was. - Daniel, what's Moon's last name? - Lewton. - What? - Lewton. Moon Lewton. Won't do ya no good, though, he was already captured in Louisiana. - [Will] Whereabouts? - I don't know. It's just somethin' I heard. Maybe Baton Rouge. - So, where do you know this Moon Lewton from? - I met Moon maybe five, six years ago. We was workin' for a movin' company. - [Will] Furniture movin'? - Yeah. Me and him started workin' off the same truck. He wasn't much of a talker, but he said enough so I knows he's queer. We just started runnin' together when we wasn't workin'. - Now, let me get this straight. You had relations with Moon? - Yes, sir. - Homosexual relations? - Yeah, that's right. - It checks out. Baton Rouge P.D. is holding one Moon Lewton. Charged with grand theft auto and involuntary manslaughter. They're interested in what we've got. - Tell 'em we'll get back to 'em. So, tell me some more about you and this Moon Lewton. - You wanna hear about when we first started runnin' through this area? - [Will] Yeah, that'll be fine. [lift whirring] - [Daniel] It started one mornin' during a job. We was movin' this old woman in Rockdale up north of here. Easy. - All right, all right, goddamn it. Oh, I don't like this shit. - [Daniel] He was tryin' pretty hard to get on my good side, ya know. I knew what he was after. Then I saw this good lookin' hide nextdoor, alone. Right away I start thinkin' about payin' her a visit later on. [ominous music] [jazzy piano music] [knuckles tapping] - Yes? - Hello, ma'am. We was movin' your neighbor here today, Ms. Rogers? I think you mighta seen us. - Oh yes, I remember you. - Well, Ms. Rogers just happened to mention that your air conditioner was broke. Well anyways, we thought we'd be glad to have a look at it for ya. Only charge ya $20, and that's if we get it runnin'. - Well, I don't know. It's awful late and all. - Well, yes ma'am. We just got through, but I figured it bein' so hot and all you'd probably want it fixed. Tell ya what, we'll only charge ya $10. It won't take Moon here but a few minutes to get it goin'. Guaranteed ya can't get it fixed nowhere cheaper. - Well, okay. I sure wouldn't mind some AC for a change. It's a window unit back there in my bedroom. - [Moon] Un-huh. [somber piano music] - [Karen] Down at the end of the hall. Would you like something to drink? - No, thank ya, ma'am. - My name is Karen Grimes, by the way. - Oh. Yeah. - Ya know, I've actually been meanin' to get that thing fixed for some time now. I really do appreciate this. - Yeah. Sure look good today. - What? - I like the way you look. Ya know, when you was out there trimmin' them bushes. [ominous music] - Thank you. [chuckles] I think I'll go check on your friend. - [Daniel] I'm sure he'll have it fixed in a minute. [Karen screams] [Karen grunting] [Karen crying] [Karen grunting] - [Karen] No, no, no. No! [Karen crying out] - She's all ready for you, Daniel, eh? [Karen crying out] This bitch is ready. [Karen grunting] - [Karen] No. [grunting] No, stop. No! [Karen sobbing] No! Oh no. [grunting] [dramatic music] - Oh boy, how ya likin' that ride? - Get me the case file on Grimes, will you? She was a missing person, 1979. - [Daniel] '78. - Go ahead. So, what did you do with the body? - Dumped it south of town. - [Will] Whereabouts? - I don't know exactly. - Do you remember the address of where any of this taken place? - No, sir. It's my first trip here into town. - All of a sudden your memory for details isn't as sharp. How come? - Well ya see, we was pretty messed up most of the time. We'd get up and start drinkin'. There'd be pills. Ya know, I have a hard time handlin' some of that stuff. I could probably find her if I looked for her. [knuckles tapping] - Oh, here it is. [somber music] - Now, which one of these is Karen Grimes? - I don't recognize her. - Well Daniel, I'm havin' one big problem with this. Everything you've been tellin' us, for the most part, has been in the newspaper. Now, I wanna believe you, but I've gotta have more. - I ain't lyin'. It's the truth. - What else did you do in Karen Grimes' home that night? Somethin' was done in the house that wasn't in the newspaper and whoever was there would know. - You wouldn't be talkin' about that thing Moon does, would ya? He's got this thing that now and then he just shits on the floor right when we're finished. - So that was Moon that defecated in the floor then? - Yeah, that was him. - All right, I wanna hear exactly what ya did with the body. - Well like I said, we went south on 35. And some-- - Wait a minute, Dan. Why don't you draw us a map? - Okay. [ominous music] So we was goin' south on 35. Guess we went about 10 miles or so, saw this sign for some creek. Thought that'd be a good place. Roll on around to the other side. Be east, I'm pretty sure. Drove back that direction a little ways and then turned in this gravel road right before the bridge. Went back a ways 'til we couldn't be seen from the road. Stopped there. Drove her over these bushes right near the creek. That's where we left her. [switch clicks] - One last thing. Do you think you could ever change? - I just don't know. Seems like killin' for me is just like breathin' for everybody else. Just can't live without doin' it all the time. - All right, Daniel. I think that about does it for now, thank you. [doctor sighs] - Well, Doc? - I just don't know. You and I and every other normal person say he's a lunatic, but in the eyes of the law... - We've cleared six murder cases in this area so far. Nine more around the state, 27 others from outside, and now the Canadians wanna talk to him and his sidekick. - Well he's pretty much of a textbook example. No father to speak of. The mother you already know about. Third grade education. He has violent hostilities for women. In fact, the only way he can perform sex is when it's humiliating to his partner, man or a woman, or when it's a corpse. - Look, Doc. I know the guy is crazy. I'm gonna leave that crap up to the court. What I wanna know at this point is can we believe this nut? Hell, he's sayin' he's killed over 200 people. - Well, I just don't know. He's a consummate liar. He mixes lies with the truth. Maybe he has, but then again... [doctor sighs] [soft ominous music] I've gotta have more time with him. - He's been in jail twice before, and I'll be damned, they turned him loose both times. Thanks, Doc. Daniel, how'd you like to take a little ride with me tomorrow? Might help you to remember a few things. - Yes, sir, I'd like to. Think it'll help this investigation. - This is it, huh? - No sir, this isn't it. - This is what you drew on your map. - Yeah, but it ain't right. For one thing, there weren't no fence over there. It's further on up the road back yonder. - Okay. Now, you think it's down this way, right? - [Daniel] Yeah, right up there. - [Will] Okay. - [Daniel] There it is, right up there. - [Will] Where? - [Daniel] Right there. [eerie music] - [Clerk] Okay, a number four made with mustard, large order of fries, and a large iced tea. - We gonna go out again tomorrow? - I don't know. That kinda depends on you, Daniel, and how much help you are to us. - I'll do everything I can to help y'all. All I wanna do is see these cases cleared up so the families of my victims can rest easy. If I can keep them young girls from hitchhikin', I'll know my life has important meanin' after all. [straw slurping] - Come on. - Baby doll, if it wasn't for these policemen here, you'd be mine. [Daniel cackles] - You fellas ready to go? - Sure. - There used to be a store. - What are you talkin' about? - Right there. Used to be a 7-Eleven or somethin'. - He's right. We got a call there one night. [engine rumbling] [Moon grunting] - I'm gonna get us some of them magazines, too. - Just don't depend on me for nothin'. - I'll mostly look at the pictures, but you could read some of that stuff out loud to me. You know, them letters and all? - Why don't you just get the kind that's just got the pictures? - They don't sell them at this kind of store. - Hell, I don't like wastin' my time on them that don't show nothin'. - Yeah, them others are better. Yeah, I wish we could make our own X-rated magazines. - Yeah, I bet that would look pretty good. Hey. We could call it somethin' like Cunt Killer. - [laughs] Cunt Killer. That sounds real good. Hey. - How you boys doin' tonight? - Fine, just real fine. - [Clerk] Anything else? [cash register beeping] [ominous music] Is that gonna be all? - Yeah. Ya got any money, Moon? Left my wallet out in the car. - No, I ain't got none. - That'll be $52.19. - Don't worry about it none, now. I'll take care of it. - Oh no! No! [gun fires] [Moon laughs] - What the? - Hey, how about we make some pictures for our magazine. - [Woman] No, God, please! [gun firing] - Come on, Moon, we gotta get a move on. Come on, get some of this other stuff. - Daniel, it's important you tell us about anything else like this. - Yes, sir. I just didn't think about 'em in that last deal. Ya think these'll help ya a whole lot? - I think they'll be very helpful to us. Why did you leave 'em in a bus station? - We just ended up bein' there a whole bunch, mainly it'd be Molly's idea. One time we was real low on money so Moon got a hold of his sister. She was pretty young, really just a kid. She was real experienced and smart. - [Moon] All right, girl, where'd you get all this? - With workin'. - Where? - You know. - Yeah, you gonna catch a disease in that place. - Yeah, well even if I do and it rots my brain, I'll never be as stupid as you are. - You better watch your tongue, girl, or you're gonna be headed right back to that whorehouse. - It's not a whorehouse, it's a massage parlor. - What are you talkin' about? I thought she was headin' back. - Moon said I could stay with y'all. - Yeah? - Yeah. Look, I'm the one who bailed y'all out. [scoffs] Don't give me any of this little girl shit. - [Moon] What do ya think? - Well, guess it don't bother me none. Course we ain't makin' no money or nothin'. - What have ya'll been up to, huh? [chuckles] I know what ya been up to. [Molly chuckles] I'll show ya how to make some real money at it. Come on, let's go down to the bus station. - How come? - You'll see. - [Daniel] Molly really knew them bus stations. She showed us how to use lockers for keepin' stuff in. It only cost a quarter for as long as you want. That way we didn't have to carry so much in the car. - Well, what do ya think? [siren blaring] Shit. Man, I thought they was comin' for us. Well looky here. - This here's Jasmin. She just split up with her sugar daddy. All right, Jasmin. There ya go. I told her she could ride with us a ways. - Hey honey. - Jasmin says she'll be glad to pay for the ride. She says she knows how to please. - Any way you want it. [twangy country music] ♪ I found love [mumbles] ♪ I nailed it on the wall - [Molly] Wait, wait, wait, wait. [dramatic music] [ominous music] - [Will] How many killings was Molly involved in? - I don't know exactly. Be a bunch over the last couple of years. - [Will] It didn't bother Moon to have his sister involved in all these killings? - No, he liked it. We got her to makin' meals when they needed makin'. Besides, she was a lot better than us at pickups. - How did you get along with her? - Real good. We was married, ya know. - When did this happen? - About a year ago. We just did it ourselves, didn't have no preacher or nothin'. - I see. So, what effect did this have on the relation you had with Moon? - We was fine. Kinda funny thinkin' about bein' related and all. Besides, me and Molly had a normal relationship. Weren't no sex involved. [knuckles tapping] - Ah thanks, Goosenberry. That's okay, I got it. - Now Daniel, what we have here are unsolved murder and missing persons cases, dating as far back as nine years ago. And they're not all just in Texas. They're from all over the country. - You want me to show you mine? - Yes. I'd like for you to very carefully look at these. If you see anything you recognize, let me know. - Okay. - I don't like doin' niggers, neither does Moon. Mm-mm. No. [Daniel grunts] Mm-mm. Mm-mm. This one we did. We saw this guy standin' by the side of the road. Moon says, "You wanna pick up that hitchhiker "and have sex with him and kill him?" So I said, sure, why not. He told us he was goin' to Florida, so I said we was, too. Moon tried to do sex with him but it didn't work so he broke his neck. Then when was through, he woulda been cut up into a bunch of pieces that we'd throw out about every 50 miles. I remember somethin' kinda funny. We got $50 off this guy and we got breakfast, and after the first bite Moon says, "Thanks, Steve, wherever you are." [chuckles] This one we did. Yep, in Illinois, a lake somewhere. Used one of my favorite tricks on her. I'd go someplace real crowded, find the best lookin' hide I could, tell 'em I needed help 'cause of a broken arm. I had this thing I'd wear on my arm, ya know, a sling. Just about always they'd fall for it. Once they got in the car to go with me, had to move kinda fast 'cause they'd figure things out pretty quick, and it was too late by then. Already know about this one. - Which one? - Ya know, the one up in Utah. Yeah, I told ya about carryin' her body with me to South Carolina. - Oh, wait a minute. I'm sorry, I'm [sighs] I'm gettin' kinda confused here. Is this the school teacher that you abducted in the shoppin' mall? - Yeah. - All right. - I know this one. [ominous music] This is one of mine. [engine rumbling] Hey, wake up. We gotta get movin'. - What? - Come on, we slept late. All the cars are gone. - So what are we gonna do? - Same thing, it's just harder in the daylight. - We shouldn't have let Moon take the car. - That ain't no problem. We just act like hitchhikers. - And then what? - We kill 'em and take their car. It's real simple. [Daniel grunts] - Hey. You want I should get us the ride while you hide out? - Yeah. Here, use this as soon as you get in the car. Make sure nobody's around. [flat tire rumbling] Shit, this is gonna be perfect. You wait over there 'til I call ya. [soft suspenseful music] [air pump hissing] [man groans] Need some help, mister? - Well, if you're askin', I'll take it. - You a preacher? - No, doctor. Krivics is my name. - I'll get that. - Well, thanks very much. - Uh, Doc. When we get through here, can I get a ride, me and my wife? We'll go any direction. - Absolutely. You got yourself a deal. Hi there, young lady. - Hi. How are ya? - Fine, how are you today? - Just fine, thank ya. - Ya know when somethin' like this happens usually there's nobody around. I guess the good Lord was watchin' over me today, knew I needed you people to give me a hand. - Doc, you got somethin' drippin' under here. - [Dr. Krivics] Let me take a look at it. - Right down there. [ominous music] - [Dr. Krivics] Ah, my old eyes aren't as good as they used to be. I don't see a thing. - Oh, I'm sure it's all right. Sure it's nothin' important. You can go on the way it is now and look at it later. - Where you all headed? - Well, anywhere we can find an honest day's work. - How long ya been on the road, young lady? - I don't know, for awhile now. - Well, ya know I might have an idea. Ya know along with my practice I've got this kind of appliance repair business. When I started out I did all the work myself, and now I hire a man to do the work. I don't know if it's anything you might be interested in or not, but my handyman quit the other day. I need somebody that works real well with tools. - Yeah? - And there's plenty of work in the office, somethin' you could help with. So ya think that's somethin' ya might be interested in? - Maybe. Just kinda depends. - Well, it doesn't pay much, but there's a real nice apartment goes with it. It's all part of the deal. [siren blaring] - Is this how this goes in here? - No, not exactly. You gotta get it all the way up here. If ya don't, you'll never get the trunk lid down. Goes right on up in there and then it fastens on the bottom there. There ya go, that's the way it is.
