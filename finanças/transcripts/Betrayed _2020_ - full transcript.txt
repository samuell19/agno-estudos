BASED ON REAL EVENTS BETRAYED NORWAY HAS BEEN OCCUPIED BY GERMANY FOR OVER TWO YEARS. IN EUROPE, THE NAZI REGIME HAS BEGUN DEPORTING AND EXTERMINATING THE JEWS. Dear everyone. The clock is ticking and we have a monumental task ahead of us. Before I get to the instructions, let me emphasize that we must execute this mission in a quick and coordinated manner. That will limit the risk of a panic and other unforeseen incidents. This is a matter of great prestige for the State Police. And our success lies squarely on your shoulders. All female members of Jewish families are to be arrested. As well as all males who were not arrested last month. This also applies to Jews in hospital. There are to be no exceptions. I will now read down the list of teams that will operate together. I'll read the leader's name first, and then who will ride with him. Meltzer... will bring Sørsdal. Frivik will bring Lageråen. Strenge Næss... will go with Berg. Zwilgmeyer will bring Schumann. Schiøtz will bring Øverby. Arneberg will bring Refshall... THREE YEARS EARLIER Now you look relaxed. Remember, he has a longer reach. Move in close, or keep your distance. And then strike. No point in holding back. You're in good shape now. Light and quick. It's all up to you now, okay? Relax. Thanks. - Ready? - Yeah, this will be great. I'll be rooting for you. Okay. One more time. Concentrate. Yes! One more time! One, two, three! Keep going! Excellent, Charles! Keep going! Don't back down! Good, Charles! - Yes, Charles! - Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine, ten! Sweet! Norway! Norway, Norway! And at the end, my brother took his gloves off. Before the Swede had hit the floor. - Stop exaggerating! - I'm not. It was totally... Want anything? An aquavit? Two aquavits. - That's too strong for you. - No, it isn't. Fine, get me a beer. Two beers, please. What do you think you're doing? What? Telling people we're getting married? - Who said that? - He did. - I'm going to be in a movie. - A real movie? - Harry? - Yes. He's my brother. Don't listen to him. So he's lying? - Hm? - You didn't say it? - No, I mean... - Charles! It's just, don't... I had to say something to get him to come. I wanted him to meet you. Cheers! Cheers. Cheers! - Dance? - May I? Hi, there. - Isak, this is Ragnhild. - Hi. Isak. I'm his brother. - How did the fight go? - Great. I won. - Charles, do you know what time it is? - No. Where are you supposed to be right now? He won the fight. We were just going to have a beer. But I'll get my coat. - Sorry. - Nice to meet you. You're just jealous. You thief! Give me that. - He can't hold his booze. - Charles! You aren't bringing that glass home with you. Finally! - Where have you been? - Boxing. We've been waiting. Is mom mad? Disappointed and a little sad. - Don't tell me what to do! - Put that down. - What's with him? - He had a drink. It looks like he had more than one. Harry? Hi. Come on. Pull yourself together. - Get a grip! - I'm fine. Spit that candy out. They're here. - Hi, mom. - Good Sabbath. Hi. Good Sabbath. - Sorry we're late. - Good Sabbath. How did it go? - I won. - No way! - You won the fight? - We beat Sweden. - We beat them. - Incredible! So... So it was a little hard to leave right away. We had to... There were speeches. And trophies. So it took a little longer than expected. - We had to celebrate him. - Harry was so nervous! So I'm glad it went well. You always do as you please. You have no respect for your family or your background. The fight is one thing, but not coming home? And bringing Harry? - How was shul? - Please! Let's just eat. Charles. You recite the Kiddush. You want me to recite it? - You want him to recite the Kiddush? - Sure, why not? Very good. - Have some more. - It's delicious, mom. Cheers and congratulations, Charles. - Here's to Norway. - Yes, to Norway. Mind your own business. And use your own napkin! - Look, I'm perfectly clean. - Fine, you wash it. - How can he fall asleep like that? - What's he dreaming about? - Does it hurt? - No. It's fine. It looks better now. Hey. You have something on your mind. What is it? I have... met a girl. That's nice. But... she isn't Jewish. Her name is Ragnhild, and... I know you're going to love her. Yes... I just want you to be happy. I know, mom. Look what I got! Two eggs. - Great. - From the neighbors. What? We haven't heard from Lithuania in ages. There's a war going on. Things take time. I refuse to flee again. We won't have to. The war will never come here. You have your sewing, my shop is hobbling along, and... I'm sorry. Sorry. Boys? Your father has learned a new expression. Could you say that again, Benzel? "My shop..." My shop is hobbling along! What did you say? My shop is hobbling along! Your shop is hobbling along? Can you bring those sausages to Andersen? Sure. - Mrs. Andersen? - No, Andersen upstairs. They can't walk the stairs anymore. It's a small parting gift. So their apartment will be available? Apartment? It's one room. Hi. Is your father here? Charles! What is it? What is it? Charles. What... Charles, say something. Will you marry me? - Are you serious? - Yes. Don't forget that package, Charles. I just proposed to Ragnhild. This is Ragnhild. Hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. Has she answered? Say yes. You'll have a good life with Charles. - Yes. - Yes? Yes, I'll marry you. - Bye, dad. - Bye! - Ragnhild Braude? - Not bad, huh? We used to dance all the time. Why did we stop? Can four kids in a two-bedroom apartment have something to do with it? Dear everyone. Dear Ragnhild. I remember the first time I met you. Fortunately it was me, and not one of my brothers. It was my turn to help dad pick up meat in Sweden. So I was on the train. And into my car comes Ragnhild. I've never seen anything so beautiful. I managed to steal a private moment with you. And here we are. So, everyone, allow me to propose a toast... to Mrs. Braude! - I love you. - I love you, too. My god, you're beautiful! We'll be happy here. Yeah. Two more beds in that corner, a kitchen over there. A hall there, where we can serve welcome drinks... Imagine a bunch of kids running around. One more layer of wallpaper... and there won't even be room for us. There's room for plenty of kids here. I'm starting to think you're serious. Charles, down in the basement! The Commanding Admiral reports: Tonight, German warships have passed the fortress in the Oslo fjord and continued inward. At 04:30, there were reports of a battle between warships and Oscarsborg fortress. At 05:00, the Foreign Minister received a German envoy, who said Norway should not resist, as the Germans have landed troops. He advised Norway to submit to the German military administration. Promise to take care of mom. - Why don't you join me to Sweden? - Our lives are here. Tell the boys to be careful. Goodbye. Hi. The Brits will have kicked them out within two weeks. - Two weeks? - Fine, three. Keep moving. Keep your distance. Do some shadowboxing. Hi. Let's go into my office. Gather around, boys. We have to close the club. We're done. Why? The only way we can continue, is if we join Quisling's NS party. No way! QUESTIONNAIRE FOR JEWS IN NORWAY - I don't want to fill this out. - What are you saying? I don't want to do it. They'll send it around to the theaters. No one's hiring Jews anymore. No one's going to send that around. They're pigeonholing us. Asking what my faith is. I have no faith. Charles, you're a Jew! Not anymore, mom. I'm Norwegian. This isn't about faith, or whether or not we feel Norwegian. - What, then? - To the Nazis, we're a race. The Jews are a race, not a religion. That's why you fled Lithuania. - Enough! - But he's right! Being Jewish has caused us nothing but trouble! Sit down! And do as your mother says! What if I don't? Fill out the form. You brat. I'm not doing it. Three months in jail if we refuse. I'll take that chance. This is crazy. Just get the stamp. Come on. Let's leave. Isak Braude. Harry Braude. Charles Braude. Happy now? GERMANY VICTORIOUS ON ALL FRONTS Who are these boxes for? I just got an address on the west side of town. Listen. What? Someone from the resistance asked if I can drive to the border next week. Drive what? People. Escaping. Didn't you hear about Trondheim? No, what happened there? They arrested Jewish men from the synagogue. Not just Jews. Resistance fighters. Resistance fighters have been shot. - So we're going to Sweden? - Not we. I am. I have the truck. You can't do it alone. Of course I can. It's too dangerous. Shouldn't we go, too? - What if you get caught? - You aren't coming. I'm bringing fugitives. I don't have room. - Have you talked to dad? - Of course not. You stay here, look out for them. Hi, girls. What are you doing here? Mommy's gone. "As they jumped from ice floe to ice floe, "their flippers slapped against the ice. "The seals clapped with their flippers and laughed. "When snow fell on the ice, Snorre swept it away..." Maja. Good to see you. Mommy! Hi! Hi! - Is everything okay? - Yes. - Want to read some more? - Yes! Let's find out what happens to Snorre the Seal. - What happened? - They brought me to the police station. What did they want? They know Jakob has escaped. Everyone has been registered. If I don't tell them where he is, they'll arrest me, too. And take the kids. - Do you know where he is? - He wouldn't tell me. I knew I'd end up in a situation like this. You should have seen them. They shook me, shouted, grabbed... Do you want the girls to stay here? No, they need to come with me. Just put it there. There you are! - Hi. - Hi. Can you bring those inside? We're behind schedule. Now I know why you took this job. Just put it here. They're recruiting for the Eastern Front. Everyone line up! Let's get out of here. ♪ Yes, we love this land... ♪ - What are you doing? - Nothing. Just unload the truck. Come on. Charles, jump in. Stop that. Just start the car! - Come on, Charles! - Let's get out of here. Aren't you going to work? Ten more minutes. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning! My mother knows about an apartment. An apartment? A bigger one. - With a kitchen and two bedrooms. - Two bedrooms? One for each of us? Maybe it's time. I agree. Who is it? Police. My god! What have you done, Charles? - I just... - Police! Open the door! I scraped up a Nazi's car. - Coming! - Why? You know what they're like. They can't prove it was me. I don't understand why you'd do that. Yeah, I know. And I'm supposed to have your baby? Open the door now! - Charles Braude? - Yes. We have a warrant for your arrest. - What's the charge? - Put your pants on. Why are you arresting him? Pack warm clothes. Why does he have to pack?! - Tell us what this is about! - Get dressed and come with us. - Where is he going?! - Just pack something. I'll be back before you know it, okay? Put that on. - There. Come on. - Give me two minutes with my wife! - We'll let you say your goodbyes. - Good. Listen. I love you. Don't worry. I'll be back soon. - I don't know where you're going. - Don't worry. Everything will be fine. I'll be back soon. I love you. - Come on. - I'll be back before you know it. Charles! Charles! Charles, take it easy! - What are they doing here? - Get in the car. - What are you doing here? - Don't give them an excuse. BERG INTERNMENT CAMP BERG INTERNMENT CAMP OUTSIDE TØNSBERG Jews! Jews! History demands that you are here. And as long as you are here at Berg, we in the State Police will give you the treatment you deserve. But let one thing be clear: If you try to escape, you will be shot! Without warning. Down! Lie down! Get down! Everyone down! Lie down! Down! Get into your rooms and lie down! Get in and lie down! Come on! Keep moving. Keep moving. What's going on? There are Jews from all over the country here. Officer? This can't be right. None of us know why we are here. I'm an attorney. We have rights. We have a right to know why we are here. We haven't done anything wrong. It's a simple question. Question? Yes. You don't have the right to ask questions, Jew. Back to work! Are you okay? Yeah. How long do you think it would take... to make it over there? How far is it? 200-300 meters? And this. This here. It isn't... It isn't exactly reliable. It isn't. Not like a nice, German Luger. So there's a chance I might... I might miss. But though I might miss someone... who made it across there... I'd definitely hit one of those left behind. - Hi, Sara. - My god! - Want me to help you? - No, these are the last ones. Have you heard anything? No. Have you? No. I don't understand where they could be. Why were they arrested? Good question. Next. Name? Sara Bertha Braude. Report here in person every day. Do you know anything else about our men? I heard there's a place outside Tønsberg. Is it a prison? - I don't know. - Or a work camp? Sara Bertha Braude. Can't you please answer me? Next. Do you have children? Imagine if they were yours. Next! - Next! - Did you find out anything? Get up! Up! Everyone get up! Get up! Up! Get up! Faster! Hurry! Run! Hey! Run all the way to the end! Run! I want you to run! When I say run, you run! Get moving! Up! Down! Okay, run! Keep up the pace! And now I want you to crawl! Get down! Lie down and crawl along here! Crawl! Crawl! I said crawl! Come on! Do it right! Listen to me! Crawl! Hurry! We can do this. Get your butt down. Come on, Harry. Come on. Crawl. Stay away from him! - Almost there, Harry. - Down! Hey, come here! Line up here! Bring shovels and line up here. Bury him. Bury him! Hey! Start shoveling! Do it! Keep shoveling! Come on, Harry. Leave him alone! If you help him, I'll punish everyone! Come on, Harry. Keep shoveling! Hey! We can do this. Hey! Help me! Hey, you! Hey! Come here. Come on. Feel free to warm yourself. See that picture? See that? Autographed. Porat. He was one sly dog. Olympic gold medal. Not bad. Four international wins against Sweden. Never lost. Eventually, he was so superior that no Norwegian wanted to fight him. In '26, his masseur had to fight him, so he could win the title. Did you know that? No. Sit down. Have a seat. I must say, I think you're... you're an incredible boxer. That match against Sweden. How was that? - Sweden? - Yeah. I was there. I've seen you fight. Hey. Relax. We're just talking. Want one? Come on. Here. To be honest, I've been a little envious of Porat's masseur. He was probably terrified, but still, to have a chance to... To get a shot against the best. I've always wanted that. Experience that level. Know what I mean? So... So I had a little idea. You don't want to be here. I don't want to be here. All the officers here came from the Eastern Front. They're bored sick. So what if you and I... What if we went a few rounds? As an escape from all this. We could have our own little Berg Championship. Think about it. - What did he want? - He wanted to fight. He wanted to box. Don't even think about it. Why not? Don't you think I can beat him? He may be a weight class above me, but I can crush him. No, that's exactly what we can't do. Why not? You can't fight your way out of everything. This isn't about boxing. You're a clown to them, Charles. A clown? Me? - Harry is about to break! - You don't understand. How long should we take this?! That registration may have seemed like a formality. Making separate rules for us. Putting us in prison camps. But that's how it started back home, too. I've seen people chased from villages, their shops burned – for being Jewish. You can never beat them! You will never gain their respect. Never! No matter how good a fighter you are. Understand? To them... you are nothing. So don't give them anything. Not even your little finger. Nothing. I'm terrified. Of what might happen. To you. Harry. Isak. To your mother. I fear the worst. Hey, you two! Get inside! - Did you... - I registered everything of value. We'll take Braude next. - Are they the last ones? - I think so. Mrs. Sara Braude? Haakon Høst. Receiver. Your assets and property have been seized by the government. We need to go through your apartment. Kitchen sundries. Dining room. 150 kroner. Please. I work as a seamstress. - This is nice. - 50 kroner. Writing desk. 70 kroner. Ceiling lamp. Wrought iron. 50 kroner. Yeah. We're pretty much done here. Were you about to fire up the oven, Mrs. Braude? It is cold here. I'm trying to save firewood. It is very cold. I'm used to it. It's nice with a fire on days like this. Why don't you help Mrs. Braude light a fire? No, please. Thank you. That's my engagement ring. We aren't completely heartless. There, we have registered everything of value. Yes. JEW (CLOSED) When I say "run!", I want you to run! It isn't so cold today. That's nice. - Want one? - No, thanks. We need to do something with the latrine. It's... It's hopeless. Have you thought about my proposal? A fight. Me and you. No. - What? - I... The answer is no. Do you think you can say no to me?! You think you're allowed to say no to me?! Come on! Come on! Crawl! Crawl! Jew cunt! Crawl! Get up! Crawl like a pig. Crawl like a pig! Crawl around. Let me hear you! Pig! Kiss the pig, you fucking pig. Kiss the pig, dammit! Are you a pig? Huh, are you? Kiss the pig in the ass! Thanks. Charles. You did the right thing. Eat. We can't eat this. We eat what they give us. You say that about mom's cooking, too. I heard that they... I'm trying to think of something funny to say, but I can't. My boys! Want to box, dad? Huh? Town hall. - I can see the palace. - The palace? - Can't you? - Sure. - Where? - Can't you see the palace? - Over there. - Behind the National Theater, nitwit. There it is! State Police. Rød speaking. I see. Please wait here, Mr. Rød. I knew I'd find you at your office. The ship arrived this afternoon. That's an overview of cargo space and capacity. How much time do we have? 48 hours. Is that a problem? No, that... No, of course not. Good. Rød? We're taking all of them. All of them. No exceptions. Yes. - Hi! - Hello. Are you here? It's happening. Have you been working all night? Summon everyone. Even those not on duty. And we need every last taxi in Oslo. Understood? Yes. - There's plenty more to do here. - I'll make coffee and give you a hand. We're finally getting rid of them. Please? No. Are you just going to stay here? You can't sit here and wait. That isn't an option. You have to do something. I know, but where can I go? I have nowhere to escape to! There's a kiosk in Fagerborg. The people there are good. They help Jews. How can I trust someone... - They're good people. - How do you know? Either that, or take a car over to Sweden. I've heard that costs 500 kroner. - I don't have that much. They took everything. - I'll give you the money. You'll be safe in Sweden. Helene is there. It will work out... It will work out fine. Yes? Yes. You have to get ready. I'll go make the deal, and then come back to you. You'll be fine. - Hi. - Hi. Sorry to disturb you so late. I live next door. How can I help you? I've been hearing rumors. People are saying... What? That something is happening with us Jews tonight. My baby is sick and my husband is at Berg. So I wondered if you knew anything. No. I can't remember having heard anything like that. Could you... call? And check? If anything is going to happen to us? Just to make sure. As a good neighbor. Give me a minute. Good evening, this is Assistant Police Chief Knut Rød. A quick question. Is anything going on regarding the Jews? Any planned operations or anything like that? Yes. Yes, I see. No, I understand. Yes. Thank you. Yes. Goodbye. No, there don't seem to be any police orders regarding that. I see. Then that settles that. That settles that. Thank you. Let's go for a little walk. Everyone up! Everyone up! Get out! Come on! Assembly! Out! He said assembly! Get out! - Is that everyone? - Yes. Good. Now listen up! Everyone, listen! We are dividing you into two groups. Group 1 goes to the gate. Bring all your possessions. Group 2 remains standing. I'll only read your name once. So pay close attention. "Nils Behak. To the gate." "Bernard Israel Berenhaut. To the gate." "Phillip Moses Bild. To the gate." "Moritz Nachtstern. To the gate." "Leo Løgård. To the gate." "Rolle Dickman. Remain standing." "Benjamin Fritjof Friedmann. To the gate." "Benjamin Lewenstein..." - What's going on? - I don't know.

"Isak Braude. To the gate." "Charles Braude." "Remain standing." "Abraham Marcus Aboch. To the gate." "Georg Emil Koklin. To the gate." "Kai Feinberg. To the gate." Aren't we going to wait for Charles? You can return to your barracks. Get back in line! Dad. Harry. - Charles! - Harry. - Charles! - Dad. Harry. - Harry. - Leave us! - You have to stay here. - No. - I want to be with you. - Charles. - Dad... - You'll be fine. I can't... I can't stay here alone. - I can't be here without you. - You have to stay. Stay, if it's the last thing I ask of you. He isn't staying! Come on, Charles. Come, Charles. Hey! Dad... Charles, come with us. Hey! - Do as I ask. - You're coming with us! It's better if he stays. Charles! - Charles! - Harry! Harry! It's better if he stays here. Where are they going? You know what? You're lucky you married an Aryan. Hey! It's okay. Hold him there! Hold him there! You want to box? Let's see how good you are! Too quick! Should we put on boxing gloves? You son of a bitch. Yes! Yes! Let him go! One, two, three... Hey, don't stop this now! We aren't done here! Get up, you Jewish pig! Get up! Are you done? Yes! Come on! Don't you dare give up now! Don't you dare give up! One more! And again! Enough! I'll read the teams that will operate together. I'll read the leader's name first, and then who will ride with him. Meltzer... will bring Sørsdal. Frivik will bring Lageråen. Strenge Næss... will go with Berg... Sara! Grab your things. You have to hide. Come on. Get into the car. Hurry. - All right. - Come on. Get in the car. Come! Open this door now! Quickly, quickly! There's one more here. Police! Open the door! Sara Bertha Braude? She isn't here. Wait here with him. Come on. Search the entire building. - Where are we going? - We're going for a drive. Hi, girls. Don't worry. There. Let's go. Hurry, we have a boat to catch. Hurry up! I have more people to pick up. Damn engine. It could be the carburetor. Or the spark plugs. If you're tricking me, you'll end up in jail. I'm just as eager as you to get these damn Jews out of here. - Engine trouble? - Yes. I have room for one more here. Go to the kiosk in Fagerborg. - Okay. - The kiosk. - Come on! - No, no! Mommy! Can't you see she's sitting with her kids? Let go of her! Let go. You don't separate a mother from her children. Have you no shame? Come here. Come on. Over to the reception. Everyone is to register. Over to the reception. Everyone needs to register. Keep moving! Come on! Everyone to the reception. Everyone must register. Everyone must register! Everyone go to the reception! Line up! Stay in your line! Keep moving! Line up! Stay in line! Line up! Thank you. Thank you. Look straight ahead and stay in line! Thank you. Next. Where are we going? Next. Faster! Faster! Get out! Keep moving! Continue through the building and out the other side. Rød? Rød, Knut! Rød. Is Amalie here? It's your neighbor. Håkon Laksov. Is Amalie here? Is Amalie here? And little Dan? I haven't seen her. Are you sure? She wasn't there when they came for her. Keep moving! All the men this way! Faster! Is she there? Keep moving. Mom! - Mom! - Mom! Sara! Mom! Mom! Sara! - Mom! - Sara! Mom! - Mom! - Sara! - I'm leaving. - Yes. Knut Rød is here. Good to see you. Heil Hitler. - Are those the lists? - Yes. Excellent work, Knut. Thank you. Go get some sleep. Women, children, and men over 45 – to the left! Women, children, and men over 45 – to the left! Men under 45, to the right. Faster! No speaking! Hi, Sara. You're being separated for showers, then you'll see each other again. Women, children, and men over 45 – to the left! Men under 45 – that way! Benzel! - Where are the boys? - Here. Mom! Harry! Isak! Where is Charles? - Come on! - No, no! Let go of each other! Move! Harry! Move! No speaking! Faster! Keep moving! Where are they going now? Where are they going? Everyone out. - Mommy, what's happening? - No speaking! Remember your number. Come on. Over to the door! 529 JEWS WERE DEPORTED FROM NORWAY TO AUSCHWITZ ON THE CARGO SHIP SS DONAU ON NOVEMBER 26, 1942. A TOTAL OF 773 JEWS WERE DEPORTED FROM NORWAY TO GERMAN DEATH CAMPS DURING WWII. 38 SURVIVED. 735 LIVES WERE LOST. SARA AND BENZEL WERE GASSED THE NIGHT THEY ARRIVED AT AUSCHWITZ. HARRY AND ISAK WERE BOTH KILLED AT THE CONCENTRATION CAMP. HELENE BRAUDE REMAINED SAFE IN SWEDEN THE ENTIRE WAR. JEWISH PRISONERS WERE HELD AT BERG THROUGHOUT THE WAR. THEY WEREN'T LIBERATED UNTIL MAY OF 1945. CHARLES AND RAGNHILD MET AFTER THE WAR, BUT NEVER FOUND THEIR WAY BACK TO EACH OTHER. HÅKON LAKSOV WAS KILLED AT AUSCHWITZ. AMALIE LAKSOV MADE IT TO SWEDEN WITH THEIR SON DAN. MAJA MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO SWEDEN WITH HER CHILDREN. CHARLES CONTINUED HIS BOXING CAREER FOR SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE WAR.
