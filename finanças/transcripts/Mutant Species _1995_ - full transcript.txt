I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS CRAP ALL DAY, AND I HAVEN'T GOT A STRAIGHT ANSWER YET, AND NOW I'M GONNA GET ONE, BY GOD. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WE LOST OUT THERE. GO AHEAD, FROST, TELL HIM. IT'S YOUR TOY. WE DEVELOPED A MUTATING STRAIN OF DNA, ONE THAT CAN BE INTRODUCED INTO LIVING ORGANISMS BY WAY OF VIRAL INFECTION. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT SOME KIND OF DISEASE HERE? HEH!

JUST WHAT'S THAT GONNA DO TO THE ENEMY? THAT'S THE HOOK RIGHT THERE, GENERAL. IT'S NOT DESIGNED FOR THE ENEMY. IT'S DESIGNED TO USE ON OUR BOYS, MAKE THEM FORGET ABOUT PEGGY SUE AND MOM'S APPLE PIE, TURN THEM INTO NON-THINKING KILLING MACHINES. THAT RIGHT, MR. FROST? IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING. IT IS EXACTLY RIGHT, GENERAL! THEY TRIED IT WITH LABORATORY ANIMALS. THEY TORE EACH OTHER APART. BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP THEM. THEY WENT RIGHT ON WITH THEIR RESEARCH, OBSESSED WITH PLAYING GOD.

QUITE THE CONTRARY, SENATOR. I'M VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT ELIMINATING MY ENEMIES, WHOEVER THEY MAY BE. IS THAT A THREAT? ARE YOU THREATENING ME? DO YOU FEEL THREATENED? ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN, THAT'S ABOUT ENOUGH OF THAT. I WANT TO KNOW, MR. FROST, WHY WASN'T THIS AREA SECURED BY THE BIOHAZARD UNIT BEFORE THE SPECIAL FORCES GROUP WAS SENT IN THERE TO RETRIEVE THIS CARGO? GRAVE TACTICAL ERROR ON MY PART, GENERAL. ERROR, MY ASS.
