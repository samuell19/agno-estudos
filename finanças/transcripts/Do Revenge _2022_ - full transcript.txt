In high school, they say the best measure of success is, like, the clique you run with or the accolades you receive. But my metric is a little different. You wanna you know how you can tell when you've really reached the top? When someone wants to destroy you. Who wants a bite of me? Trick question. Everyone wanted a bite of me. I know. So ominous. You're probably like, "Why is she talking in riddles when her life looks perfect?" Listen, babe, in this story, nothing is as it seems. Bitch! What's up, Teen Vogue? I'd give my left and right tit to be Drea Torres. Of course she's the Rose hill student that made it onto the Teen Vogue Next Gen list. And she's only a junior. God, Arianna, you sound like you wanna wear her skin. She has amazing skin. She think we don't know Tara paid for this party? I bet she only got on that list because she goes to Rose hill on scholarship. Sage. You're not trying to diminish the hard work of a fellow woman of color, are you? Cupcake? - My girls and I are all about positivity… - Ooh! Oh my God. You are at peak powers tonight. I love you. I'm gagged. I love you, and I love this party. Do you think I did too much? No. It's all really understated. You're right. We have a slight problem. Allegra the Instagram witch is saying she saw you buy your dress at Salvation Army. - What? - She knows you can't afford anything else. And listen, we love you, and we think it's chic and eco that you thrift. - We don't care that your mom is a... - Stop talking. Yep. All right. Do you want me to push her in the pool, light her hair on fire? Oh my God, Meghan! Why is it always your first instinct to light someone's hair on fire? - Why isn't it yours? - No. Okay? No, Meghan. We're gonna deal with this elegantly and tell her to pack up her Ouija board and go. Okay? We need Elliot. Elliot! Who summons me? Tell Allegra to leave. Why do I always gotta be the vibe killer? Let Meghan do it. - She likes choosing violence. - No. No one is choosing violence. I think it's time I make a toast. - Yeah. Tara, gather everyone. - Mm-hmm. I'm gonna freshen up. Come on, ladies. You're getting crumbs all over me. Damn it! If you haven't already gleaned, my friends were born into this life, but I was more DIY. And before you judge me for caring about status, everyone cares about status. I just knew how to turn the dream into reality. In this moment, I finally felt like I belonged. I spent 17 years meticulously curating the perfect life. And now that I had it, no one was going to take it away from me. Clap more. Clap more. Stop! Thank you so much to everyone for being here. And thank you to Tara for throwing me this gorgeous party. - You're welcome. - Yes, yes. And Meghan, Miss Editor Extraordinaire, this Thorn piece means so much to me. Really. So, I actually wanted to take this opportunity to, um… Actually, Allegra? Where's Allegra? Over here. Hey, babe. You look incredible tonight, really. I love your little spider hat thing. It's so… big. So, Allegra and I have been working on this really cool project. Oh my God. No. Wait. Don't film me. Film Allegra. So, after telling her about my church's clothing drive, she generously pledged to donate her entire wardrobe to low-income women in need. Tomorrow, at the Salvation Army. But everybody give it up for Allegra. Right? - Yeah! - Mmm. Oh, stop. Love you, boo. So proud to know you. I love you, Drea! So do I. Hey, Dre. Apologies for my lateness, everybody. I was just putting the finishing touches on my surprise. We good, Elliot? - Oh, absolutely, man. - Oh? In three, two… Everybody… …let's all raise our glasses to Drea Torres and to her bright future. Yeah, Drea! Thank you. Thank you, guys. Tonight was fun. Yeah. I'm just bummed we're gonna be apart all summer. Who am I gonna play with? You could play with yourself. Oh. Teen Vogue's got some jokes, huh? You've got some jokes. - Babe. - Hmm? Tonight was really cute and everything, but you know I think that Teen Vogue video is stupid, right? Like, I'm just trying to get into Yale, and I need all the help I can get. Yeah, of course. Yeah, those lists are definitely bullshit, but you looked very, very hot in that video. - Yeah? - Oh my God. - You think so? - Yes. You were so hot. You know, maybe you could send me something to keep me company this summer. What do you mean? Well, just like a little something. - Yeah? - A little video. - A little video? - Yeah. - You really want me to? - Yeah. I love you. I love you too. Can you kiss me? Yeah. I'm Drea Torres, and I am so stoked to be part of the Next Gen 100, a list that celebrates the brightest... I don't believe that Montana's actually celiac. I won't choose some random restaurant for my birthday dinner just because another restaurant has a better gluten-free menu. Makes no sense. Like, she's so selfish sometimes. I'm sorry. Am I being paranoid, or is everyone staring at me right now? And, like, not in a good way. She has to be like… Loved your video, Drea. Drea. What? What? - Max. - Drea the cam girl. Oh my God. Max. I'm already on the phone talking to my dad's lawyer. Um, I gotta go. Thank you, Derek. Hey. How could you do this to me? What? I didn't do this. I got hacked. Baby, come on. I would never do this. I love you. Easy, Mayweather. This is bullshit. I'm sorry you feel that way. - Will your mother be joining us? - No. She works nights, so she's asleep. Drea, I want you to know this brings me absolutely no pleasure. If you had just come to me when you saw the video, we... Oh, so this is my fault? The video? Of course not. The way you handled it, that leaves much to be desired. Drea, we all have hard truths to contend with. Yours is that your peers have the luxury of operating on impulse. You don't. The only way for you to get ahead is to be smarter. And I thought you were a girl who was smarter. I am smarter. That being said… …you did sucker punch Rosehill's golden boy. Impressive, by the way. So, I am putting you on behavioral probation, along with mandatory community service. And if you have any altercations with Max, as your headmaster, I will have no choice but to revoke your scholarship. Today, you let your anger control you. From now on, I want you to control it. Channel that anger into getting what you want. So obviously, that video's fucked, but Max didn't leak it. He wouldn't do that, Drea. Punching him has really put us all in a weird spot. He's like our family. I think we all just need the summer to process. See you next year. So much for believing women. That day, my life went up in flames, and there was nothing I could do If I went after Max and lost my scholarship, I'd have to kiss my future goodbye. I kept asking myself the same question. Why would he do this to me? Looking back, it was a classic Icarus story. I flew too close to the sun, so my boyfriend leaked my sex tape. I hated Max, but even more than that, I hated myself for letting my guard down. The headmaster was right. I needed to channel my anger, and that is exactly what I did. Peaking in high school is cringe anyway. Eleanor, I am so delighted you wanted to go to tennis camp this summer. Dare I say you might finally make some real friends? Oh, Mama, that's very rude. What about Oscar Winner Olivia Colman? Your pet lizard is not a friend. Remember what Dr. Gratch said. - To move forward… - Mom... I can't... - …you must open up to new experiences. - Bridge... - Hear... - Eleanor? Eleanor, can you hear me? Well, it took me all of 45 minutes to realize this was a huge mistake. I was a Billie Jean King in a sea of Maria Sharapovas, but my pilgrimage wasn't for nothing. My entire life was about to change, and it all started with her. - Is that Drea the tennis pro? - No, not her. Her. Sorry. Drea Torres. She doesn't know it yet, but we're about to become besties. Are you okay? How did you even get the video? I'm not revealing my sources. Just feels kind of messed-up. It's embarrassing enough that she's our age and works here, but now everyone has seen her sex tape. Are you listening to us? No. You just have, like, a really… …weird energy. - I don't quite know what to do with it. - We don't know what to do with it. My therapist, the beloved Dr. Gratch, says that hurt people hurt people, but I just don't think that applies to teenage girls. I think sometimes they're just evil. It was Erica. The one who showed everyone that video of you. Erica Norman. She sucks. She's mean in a way I didn't know existed anymore. She's like a Bitchasaurus rex. I'm sorry. Who are you? Eleanor. I don't need your pity, Eleanor. This is insane! I don't even do cocaine! Don't you think I would know if she was doing cocaine? Just awful. - Drea! - What's up? You insufferable cunt, I know you did this. - You fra... She framed me! - You framed her! Oh, sweetie. Are you listening to yourself right now? You think I framed you? You framed her. Babe… Are you on drugs right now? I don't do cocaine! - She doesn't even know what it looks like. - I don't know what it looks like! I swear to God. I don't even do coke! I'm telling you, she's innocent! Take care, hon. We'll miss you. Jessica! Do something! So sad. I really hope she gets the help she needs. Pray for Erica. - Pray for Erica. - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. See you next summer. - Bye. - Bye. Come on. Hey. I know that sound. You're bricked. My dad restores classic cars. Do you want a ride, or… Do you still not want my pity? I didn't watch the video, by the way. Congrats. You're the only one. Is that your ex who leaked it? - Is that why you punched him? - Are you gonna talk this entire ride? How do you even know about that? I'm actually transferring to Rose hill. I, um… I saw a post about it. Moving before senior year? Ooph. Brutal. What happened to him? Your ex? Oh, you know, what happens to every guy. Nothing. I'm the slut on probation, and he and his tiny little dick get away scot-free. They always get away scot-free. Mm-hmm. I know what it's like to get screwed over by someone you thought you could trust. When I was 13, uh, I went to day camp with this girl, and she existed on this like… Untouchable plane. She glowed. I pretty much already knew that I liked girls, but I hadn't told anyone yet. But this girl, I guess I thought that if she liked me, it would validate my entire existence or something, and I finally talked to her, and… it was great. Like, she made me feel so free and confident and safe. And before I knew it, I told her that I was queer. And it felt… amazing. I mean, like, it was the single greatest moment of my life. But I guess I wasn't as safe as I thought because she told everyone that I tried to hold her down and kiss her. What? Uh… Damn. Yeah. Um… It wasn't that she outed me. I… I don't care. Everybody's fucking gay. I just… She turned me into this predator. No one would come near me. She destroyed me. No consequences for her, I assume. Nope. She actually goes to Rose hill. Really? Who? It's Carissa Jones. Carissa… Wait. That crunchy granola lesbi... Yeah. I've seen her. Damn. Outed by your own team? What the fuck was that? Sorry. - Oh my God. - Um… It just really helps sometimes. You should try it. It… it'll really help with the Max stuff. I'm fine. I don't even think about Max anymore. - Just do it. - No. Absolutely not. Thank you, no. It's recommended by medical professionals. It's called a primal scream. It helps you access parts... Fuck. You really had that pent-up, huh? You look like you want a grilled cheese. That sounds nice. Let's get you a grilled cheese. Why don't you transfer? Transfer where? - Anywhere. - I'm not like you, Eleanor. My mom is a nurse who spent her whole life working to ensure I can have a better future. I can't mess this up, and Rose hill is my only path to Yale, so… What about your friends? You mean Max's friends? I didn't realize how much power he wielded. You know, he makes you feel so safe and protected, but it's all conditional on you playing the role he wants you to play, which I thought I was doing, but I guess not. We all love an emotional terrorist. Yeah, they're so fun. What about you? Why would you wanna go to school with some bitch who ruined your life? I don't. I begged go to Dalton or Spence, but as much as I like to believe I'm the arbiter of my own social calendar, my parents still call the shots, and they think that Rose hill is the best path into an Ivy. They're not wrong. I'm dreading it. Same. Climate change is not a lie! Please don't let our planet die! Climate change is not a lie! Please don't let our planet die! Climate change is not a lie! Please don't let our planet die! Yeah. The Greta Thunberg brigade can be pretty intense. It's all smoke and mirrors. I've seen all of them use a plastic straw. - Fuck you, Gabbi! - The horror. I'm Gabbi. Are you new? I'm Eleanor. And kinda. You want a tour? I mean, as a disciple of the '90s teen movie, I would be offended if I didn't get one. If you get offended, Rose hill does have a designated safe space for that. All right, so over here, we have our Instagram witches. Allegra, their leader, apparently made a girl levitate at a sleepover playing Light as a Feather. Now she's queen of the zodiac thots, and she's a Scorpio. Hot. The horny theater kids. Last year, they tried to mount a mostly white production of Hamilton. Lin-Manuel Miranda sent a cease and desist. Um, coming up, we have our farm kids. They run the school farm led by Carissa. When her request to make Rose hill go vegan was denied, she left her DivaCup in the middle of the cafeteria in protest. It was full. Um… Who are they? Uh, Rosehill's royal court, the cream of the incredibly entitled crop. Be careful with them. They're all as calculated as they are beautiful. Oh shit. Drea Torres, their fallen queen. Stop. Stop. - Drea. - Hey. Hey, ladies. I meant to text you. Obviously, the way last year ended was so… Pretty sticky, you know, with Max's dad funding my dad's reelection campaign. - I know, yeah. - It's just so complicated. - I know. I know. - Good. Oh my God. I thought you were gonna put out a hit on me or something. No, why would I do that? Hey, Max. - How was your summer? - Restorative. I'm glad to see you. I wasn't sure you'd be back after, you know, last year. Oh, no, no. I'm not gonna let a silly video stand between me and Yale. I just wanna say I hope we can move on and be civil this year. Especially now that Tara and I are dating. Oh. You didn't know? No. No, I knew. Yeah. Good. Yeah, our families summered together in Capri. That's great. I mean, what a couple, right? Your fathers must be elated. Oh. Stop, you two. Seriously, stop. All right, guys, so fun catching up. Um… Nice to see you ladies. Montana, you have grapes in your teeth, babe. All right. - Enjoy senior year! - Why didn't you tell me? Feeling alone is a specific type of pain, with distinct recognizable signs to the trained eye. Drea and I, we were two wounded soldiers on the battlefield of adolescence. Hello, hello. Uh, if everyone can please take their seats. Do you guys know, are the seats assigned, or do we just sit anywhere? Cell phones away. Okay, I'll just go fuck myself. Nora. It's Eleanor now. - Wow. I… I almost didn't recognize you. - Yeah. - I didn't know that you go here now. - I do. I, um… I'm gonna find my seat. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. Hello, hello, hello. If everyone can please take their seats. - Who was that? - Uh, some girl I used to go to camp with. You guys, I can't believe she actually came back. I know. She looks really cute, though. Montana, shut up. - She does. Sorry. - What's wrong with you? I think it's pretty sick. I had no idea she was that twisted. We have an announcement from your senior class president, Max Broussard. Rose hill! Yeah! Thank you! Thank you! Oh, it feels so good to be back. We love you, Max! Oh come on. Stop, stop. Thank you, though. Thank you. I appreciate you. Um… Now, this… this year, uh, this is gonna be such a great year. But before we get started, I was hoping maybe I could get personal for a minute. Get personal, man. Last year, my intimate exchanges made their way into the world. It was a violation of my privacy. To be honest, I'm still recovering, but it really made me get in touch with myself, and I realized that… Actually… Actually, Drea Torres, could you stand, please? Please. Could you stand? Please? What? Where are you? Dre? Dre, I just want to say how sorry I am for what happened to you last year. And to anyone of you who watched, or you shared that video, I sincerely hope you take the time to examine why you did that. So, Dre, it's in your honor that I'm founding a new club, the Cis Hetero Men Championing Female-Identifying Students League. Now, it is for all the men at Rose hill who want to do better. Be allies. Thank you. I want to be an ally! Fuck! Drea? Hi. Just checking on you. Are you all right? He's, like, way worse than you described. I don't know how I'm gonna spend an entire year at this school. I feel you. I talked to Carissa for, like, one minute, and it felt like dipping my toe in Dante's eighth circle of hell. It was… awful. This sucks shit! Yeah. I wish that we could, like, hire people to take them down. What? Like a fucked-up TaskRabbit? Yeah. Someone completely unconnected to us. A high school hit man… or woman or NB. Oh my God. You're right. You're absolutely right. They deserve to go down for what they did to us, but we can't go after them ourselves. We should team up and do each other's revenge. Oh, you're serious. Absolutely not. Why? Uh, because I'm not capable? I can't do revenge. I mean, is "do revenge" even, like, correct grammar? Oh, I'm sorry, Schoolhouse Rock! Are you dragging my sentence structure right now? Uh, we could get caught. We could not graduate. We could get expelled. We won't get caught. That's the whole point. No one knows we know each other, right? So no one will connect us to them, to each other. It's literally perfect. With my brains and your… blank slate, we can get away with this. Don't you wanna make her pay? I don't want to make her pay. I want to burn her to the ground. Whoa. That gave me chills. Do you see this? My arm hair's up. Look at that. You're giving off some serious, like, Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction energy. Glennergy. Yes. You're radiating Glennergy right now. But if we're gonna make this work… We have to fix… No. …this. I really don't want to. We have to do… Oh, please don't say a makeover. …a makeover! - Yay! - It feels so problematic. It is, but it's fun! Let's start with Carissa. She'll be a cinch. I can ruin her in my sleep. - Moving on to Max. - Wait, go back. Why will Carissa be easy? Oh, honey, it is much easier to destroy a girl. Take your pick. Slut-shame her, turn her friends against her, prey on her vanity, turn her into a troll, exploit her darkest secrets. Make her radioactive, and no one will help her. Um, I actually really like this. Absolutely not. Ooh. It just so happens that I have to do mandatory community service this year as penance for punching Max. I already emailed the headmaster and requested the school farm, which is run by Carissa. Now, dudes, that's another story. For girls, our bodies, our choices, our thoughts are all policed by shame. Our weaknesses are their strengths. If they have a lot of sex, they're crushing it. If we do it, we're sluts. If they're angry, they're powerful, but if we show any emotion… …we're hysterical! Ladies! Indoor voices please. Wait. How much are we cutting? If men in general are hard to take down, Max is patriarchy incarnate. The ultimate manic pixie dream boy, Max has a meticulously curated persona. Rose hill is an orchestra, and Max is its conductor. Everyone loves him, which means he can get away with anything. I want to expose him. And to do that, we need undeniable proof that he's a hypocrite, a fake-woke, misogynist motherfucker. If we can accomplish that, he's done. Blot. You are now and for evermore the coolest, most mysterious student at Rose hill Country Day. I'm Frankenstein, and you're Frankenstein's bad bitch. Your new vibe is high-status cunt. You ready to be my woman on the inside? - No. For sure no. - Eleanor. It's gonna be fine. My entire life I've been a chameleon. Sometimes you have to pretend to be someone else to get what you want. Do you ever worry that you'll lose yourself? Oh my God! Don't be so dramatic. All I'm asking you to do is disassociate from your body and be someone you're not so these popular kids will invite you to be in their group. - Are you in therapy? - God, no. Why? Cool. And we're not concerned that Max is gonna realize we're manipulating him? Narcissists are too busy thinking about themselves to realize they're being played. Getting a girl's attention requires weeks if not months of work. But according to Drea, getting a guy's attention requires you walking past them once looking vaguely slutty. Who's that? Is she new? I don't know, but she is making that uniform work. Yeesh. Oh shit. Dodos. Working at the farm was certainly not on my senior year bucket list but neither was being a social pariah. Carissa was an easy target. I'm incredible with new people. Carissa, right? Yeah, we've met before. You called me a human Birkenstock. Cool. I just want to say, I'm so excited to be working at the farm. I've always been very intrigued by what you do here. You should talk to Russ. He's in charge of the, uh, volunteers. Oh. Um, actually, I was hoping I could learn from you, you know, farm queen. Yeah, I'm busy planning the menu for the ring ceremony. And, you know, for the record, ass-kissing is not gonna get you anywhere on this farm. It's honest work. Hey, Russ? Show Drea the ropes? Shoe-faced veggie fucker. I love Saunders. - Cool. - I studied him at Yale. I just did their literary arts summer program. Cool. Do you say anything other than "cool"? So cool. So, Carissa's cooking the ring ceremony dinner? Yeah. It's gonna be her big break in the culinary world. What's that? That's a greenhouse, clearly. It's where Carissa grows her special crops. Flies them in from all over the world. My ex-girlfriend is mad that I hooked up with my ex-boyfriend. Can I see your hand, please? - This okay? - Mm-hmm. I'm having a, um… party this weekend. It's a little pre-homecoming celebration. You should come. Make your exes jealous. I'll think about it. Cool. Just, uh, don't think too hard. Bring your swimsuit, floaty. It's gonna be lit. Yes! Your little dress I made you looks great. Do you love it? You love it. So, what's the deal with this little dinosaur thing? Oscar Winner Olivia Colman is my emotional support bearded dragon. My therapist told me to get a puppy, but I prefer to keep my companions thick-skinned and cold-blooded. Oh my fucking God. Do I really have to wear this? Yes. You have to look impossibly hot but also like you spent exactly one minute putting yourself together. It's important that the girls covet your look. Why are you wiggling around like your tampon's sliding out? I haven't worn a bathing suit in public, like, ever. Carissa really did a number on you, huh? Forget her. You are so much cooler than any of those dodos going to Max's party. I just want to eat my lunch on her shattered ego. I love that for you. We're gonna take care of her soon. There's a greenhouse with this massive padlock on it that only she can access, and my Spidey senses tell me she's not just growing sunchokes in there. I need to get her keys. - Perfect. - Hmm. Now, go get the dirt on Max and make revenge mommy proud. I know I looked confident, but I was profusely sweating everywhere. There she is. I tried to bring my emotional support lizard, but Drea said no. - Champagne? - Uh, yes. Over here! I'll introduce you to some friends, all right? These are good people. Yo. Kids, this is Eleanor. - Hey. Hey. - Eleanor, this is my family. - Hi. - Hello. Hi, cutie. - Yo, you made it. - Hi. And you brought a bathing suit. Sit down, Elliot. Appreciate you. Hi. I'm Tara. This is Meghan, Montana. I love your hat. - Oh. - Where did you get it? Can I have it? Meghan, don't scare her. Eleanor, come join us. Come on. Shit. Get cozy. This is so cute. - Yeah. - Thanks. Why don't I know you? She's new. But Ellie's one of us now. Aw, I love it. Look who it is. Are you stalking me? Yes. And later I was gonna murder you. Cute. I like your shirt. Did it come with a bag of granola and a matching pair of Tevas? Wow. I didn't realize that you also did the Peace Corps summer program. I should've guessed it because your vibe is definitely all about helping others. Ooh. Solid burn. Are you catching a lot of waves in Miami? It's, uh… it's actually Carissa's board. Oh. I didn't know she was over there. Hey, girl. She hates me. No. She thinks you just don't actually care about the farm. What? How could she think that, Russ? I love the farm. Okay? Those root veggies are like my children now. Shit, um… - I ate some of your kids yesterday. - No. But they were delicious. - Even the carrots? - Every last one of them. How dare you? Heartbreaking. So nice seeing you outside the farm. Bye, Drea. Our chemistry was kind of incredible. Thank God I was sitting on a towel. But I had a job to do. Hey. Bingo. - What are you doing here? - Oh no. I live here. So, Max is… My brother. Unfortunately. You neglected to mention that on your tour. Oh, I prefer "playfully omitted." Hmm. Three weeks at Rose hill, and you got a whole new look now, huh? Yeah. You not a fan? No, I think it's hot. As long as you did it for you and not them. Do I seem like that? I don't know. That's the exciting part of getting to know someone. You're a mystery until you're not. Hmm. I was gonna hole up in the screening room and catch a Godard flick if you want to… ditch the suck-fest. Maybe? I do. But I… shouldn't. Suit yourself. Oh. The orgy usually starts around sundown. Really? No. What? My brother is not that fun. Good to know you're down, though. Enjoy the cool kids. Fuck. Nice view, Max. Oh my God. He's hooking up with the Instagram witch. Hey. Do you think it's weird how we're having this party without her? Who? Drea. What do you mean, "who"? No. Hey. Max. Can we talk about it, please? Just feels weird, you know? To me, it feels weird that you're talking about my ex right now. She was my best friend too. But we're about to have sex, and you're talking about Drea. Feels, like… very weird. Well, we're not having sex. You can go fuck yourself. Have fun. That's fine. Hello? Hello? Eleanor. - Hey. - Hey. Hi. Sorry. Were you watching us? No. Um, I was in here, and then you guys came in here, so I went in there. I know what you were doing. I'd hide from my party too if I could. It's all right. Come on. I got a cool spot. You'll like this. Tell me something nobody knows about you. Why would I do that? Because… I'm interesting, and you wanna impress me. You wanna know my deepest, darkest secret? Yes. I don't want any of this. I would love to backpack across Europe with my camera. Just blow up my whole life. I would. 'Cause all this shit, it's so performative. And for what? So I can be the most popular guy in high school? Yikes. Then what do you wanna be? The real answer is I don't know. Which is about the worst answer I could give. Yeah. But it's true. You're right. We're all just performing. This feels illegal. It's not illegal. We go here. On weekdays. Whoops. So, how was Max's party? You know what? It was actually really fun. They got this hilarious boomerang of me jumping into the pool. Oh my God. A boomerang of you jumping in the pool. Can I see it? Sure. You weren't there to bank social content. You were there to get dirt on Max. Max is cheating on Tara with Allegra. I saw his texts. The Instagram witch? Yeah. Oh my God. Eleanor, this is amazing. Girl, you crushed it. Great work. Two seconds ago, you threw my phone in the dirt. Yeah, and now I'm happy with you again. Keep up. Wait. Did you get screen shots of the texts? Not yet. Mad at you. Do you really think Carissa's growing drugs? Because I want to get her, but I don't want to send her to jail. First of all, Carissa's rich, white ass is never going to jail. Second of all, the headmaster would rather Rose hill burned to the ground than have a public drug scandal on her hands. She is truly that bitch. I want her to hit me with her Tesla and then reverse back over me. I want her to stuff me like a taxidermy doll and then mount me on her wall like a prize. I want her to hide my body in the woods and then start the search party trying to find me. Ooh. Good one. Oh my fucking God. Carissa, you bad girl. So, um, what now? I think it's pretty obvious. We put these mushrooms in whatever bougie foodie bullshit Carissa's cooking for the senior class ring dinner, dosing the entire class and exposing her for the fraud that she is. Then, while everyone's tripping balls, you steal Max's phone and get us those texts. That was not obvious. Really? It's fine. I'm sure it's fine. All right, guys… Smile! Eleanor! Let's take a picture! You better be smiling. We have an announcement from your senior class president, Max Broussard. Hey! We love you, Max! There we go! Thank you. Welcome. Welcome, seniors. You one handsome-looking son of a bitch, Broussard! Elliot Tanners, ladies and gentlemen. Love you, buddy! More than friends. Now, when you wear these rings, I want you to remember all the lessons that you learned here. I want you to remember the friendships that you made, your memories of this place. When you wear these rings, I want you to remember that you are, and you always will be… A Rose hill Tiger. Let's go, Tigers! Hope you have a sick winter break. Wonderful, wonderful holidays. Happy New Year's. But first, I'm gonna turn the stage over to our resident Ina Garten. Carissa Jones, everyone. Hi, everyone. Uh, I am so honored to have made this feast for you all tonight. I really hope you enjoy it. And, uh, with that, let me take you on a journey of umami. Ooh. - Hey. - Hey. You look great. Thanks. You, uh, clean up well yourself. Oh. I know. I am so proud of you. This is gonna be the best night ever. - Who wants dessert? - I'm ready for dessert. Hmm. Is everything okay? Yeah, no. I'm fine. - Uh, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. - Mm-hmm. Eleanor? It's not working! It'll be fine, okay? Everyone devoured their cassoulet. It's gonna work. Shit. Shit. Shit. Oh my God! Bitch, get up. What is wrong with you? Get off the floor. It's so gross. Is anyone else feeling weird? I feel floaty. I feel like a… like a little butterfly. Oh no. - Please! - My pupils are fucking massive. - Please! - My pupils are huge. Can someone open up, please? Uh, I'm sorry. Someone's in here. I don't feel well either. Something's happening. Ew. Do you go to school with us? Oh my God. We're at school. Oh my God. Let's get in the water. Yeah! It's levitating! Light as a feather, stiff as a board. Light as a feather, stiff as a board. Light as a feather, stiff as a board. Light as a feather, stiff as a board. Russ, I think we've been drugged. - Nah. - No, we vibin', 'Rissa. Why can't you just come get me? Mom, please just come get me! I don't want to be here! No, no, no, they can't get Max. They can't. Don't. - Max? - No. You're a beautiful boy. Hey, Max. No. No, no, no. Don't let in the spiders. Oh my God. There are spiders all over your phone. Hello there, my little tech whiz. I see you have Max's phone. Is the download complete? It's processing, revenge mommy. Very good. There she is. My hero. Oh my God. Is the headmaster going to the greenhouse? I anonymously tipped her off. It's called double assurance, sweetie. Look it up. Are you on mushrooms? Maybe. Are you? Yeah. One down. One to go. Do you feel amazing? Incredible. I know it's bad, but watching them escort Carissa away was, like, one of the best moments of my life. Yeah, the Glennergy really leapt out. Thank you. Your house is, like… …really cozy. "Cozy" is just a nice way of saying "small." No, I… I really didn't mean it like that. No, I know. I'm sorry. I know you didn't. I just used to be so afraid of Tara and them finding out this is where I lived. Isn't that twisted? They were my best friends. Yeah, but your instincts were right. I guess. Speaking of, I'm ready to see those texts. You sure? Okay. Let's go. All right. Come over here. Oh my God. He's cheating with half the girls at Rose hill. There are messages here from a girl in every clique. Goes back years. Sorry. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean… …Max is a lying garbage rat, so no surprise he was a cheater too. If we expose those texts, everyone will know he did this to you. Good. He'll look even worse. We should do it on Valentine's Day. Really go for the drama. You know you don't have to be brave with me. This sucks. It's allowed to suck. Yeah. Fine. It sucks. It really sucks. Do you think I'll feel better? What do you mean? I'm just so angry all the time. There's this knot in my chest… And the Max stuff made it worse, but… it's always been there. And every day, I feel it getting tighter and stronger. And I feel like it's choking me. Sometimes it just hurts to exist, you know? I just wanna feel normal again. Yeah. I know exactly what you mean. Come here. I like you, Eleanor. You're just like me. Yeah. I am. Move. Further. Further. - Thank you. - Okay, ready? Go, go. Good morning, Rose hill students. Love is certainly in the air with Valentine's Day right around the corner. Today, I'm joined by Meghan Perez, two-time National Scholastic Press Association Award winner and editor of The Thorn. Thank you so much, Meghan, for joining us today. The pleasure is all mine, Tara. I am so happy we get to talk about the profile you're running in today's Thorn. Last year's public assault sent a shock wave through the campus. And as a journalist, it felt like such a ripe space for closer exploration. When I approached Max about this piece, I wasn't sure how he would feel about it. But he was so game to get his side of the story out there. I am constantly blown away by his strength. I know. He was so vulnerable, so honest. Well, I can't wait for everyone to read this thought-provoking piece. Hey. Hey, hey. What's up? You okay? No, not really. Uh, look, I'm having a pretty shit morning myself, and I was contemplating ditching. Would be a lot more fun if I had a mate. A mate? Yeah. Was gonna go for a joyride. Let's roll. What? Russ. What is this place? My dad bought this warehouse a couple of years ago and then decided he didn't want it, so he just left it with me. Wait. So, this entire warehouse belongs to you? It's an artist collective. Artist? I didn't know you were an artist. Sure, well, you don't tend to ask many people questions about themselves. Okay, rude. But fair. So, what are we doing here? So a couple of years ago, when my parents were getting divorced, I… felt like I was caught in between the whole thing, and… I was just really angry. But I found that throwing paint at these canvases really helped me channel my rage. I've been coming here a lot since… Carissa got expelled. It's been really tough for me without her. And I thought, with everything you've been through, maybe it could help you too. I know this year hasn't been easy for you either. Oh, you're dead. - Oh! Murder you! - No, no, no. Russ! Okay, okay. Let's make… How're you feeling? Much better. Thank you. High school is stupid, and I look forward to being done with it. Yeah, I feel you. So, what are your plans? Yale then Harvard Law. That's a rough combo. Oh, so you're a socialist? All I'm saying is, don't equate your worth to some archaic idea of what the best means. Hey, um, can I say something that might make you very uncomfortable? I guess you have to now. I just want to say I'm sorry. About what happened with Max. Thank you. It really means a lot. You good? Yeah. And now, the founder of the Cis Hetero Men Championing Female-Identifying Students League, Max Broussard. Thank you. Thank you. - Love you! - Yeah, baby. Thank you, guys. So, we in the League, we've been trying to put our heads together to figure out a way to show all of you ladies at the school how much you mean to us and, more importantly, how much we respect you. Come on. Let's give it for respecting women! Sorry. Now, as we all know, Valentine's Day is inherently patriarchal. It is heteronormative, and, honestly, it's kind of isolating, because you shouldn't have to have a special someone in your life to feel included. In fact, the most special someone in your life is you. Aw. - Gag me! - So… We thought, "Why not take back this day and make it all about loving ourselves?" And… and, uh… So, we have… And, uh… Oh my God, his texts! Are you kidding me? What's going on? You're terrible. Did you see this? I'm shocked! This is shocking news! What's going on? What an asshole, right? Oh my God. Oh my God. Cover me. Shocking! I'm shocked! Cover me now. Feminist, my ass, you know? - Higher. - Let's go. Higher. It's gonna be okay. Cover me. Go! Go faster! We're casting spells tonight, bitches. Here's what I heard went down. One of his side pieces blasted him. She found out he wasn't just keeping her a secret. Mm-mm. He's banging a girl in every clique. Guess Max's allyship was an act. Ban men! Hey, rip 'em up, ladies. Get out of the way! No, we're in the library. This is bad for us both. How do we spin this? No, no, no, no. Max is in his safe space. Yeah. Please make this go away. Baby, I'm on with my dad's strategist. Maximus, you okay? Fix it, please. Oh my God. Yes, that's genius. Thank you so much. Okay, guys, here's the plan. Tara and Max are ethically non monogamous. They're poly. Honestly, y'all, it's kind of wack to bind yourself to some old-school ideas of what we think relationships should look like. Y'all, we're young. We're fluid. - We should be out there eating ass, dawg. - Yeah. It's actually super progressive of them to transcend heteronormative structures, you know? This is America. We finna eat any ass we want, y'all. Get in there and eat that ass is what I'm saying. Also, if they're open, then that means… …I have a shot with Max! - I have a shot with Max! - I have a shot with Max? I have a shot with Max. I have a shot with Max. Bitch. I have a shot with Max! He's actually more progressive than I thought. I never doubted him, not for a second. Drea. The headmaster wants to see you in her office. Okay, I'll be right there. Fuck. It's been quite an interesting day. You know, I pride myself on having this uncanny ability to spot and nurture talent. Well, maybe not directly nurture, but you know, I can see it, and then I delegate the nurturing. When I read your application essay, I thought, "This girl is the future." "This girl is special." I hate being wrong. You weren't wrong. I only trim my bonsai when I'm especially vexed. Poor thing has seen a lot of action this year due, in large part, to you. She's gonna be bald soon. I just got off a rather distressing call with Jessica Cron, head of admissions for Yale. Oh, this is about Yale? What else would it be about? Nothing. I… Wait. Did Yale reject me? I tried to turn her. But your grades have slipped, your extracurricular is nonexistent, and the icing on this unsavory cake, someone sent her the Thorn piece detailing your assault on Mr. Broussard. It's quite the trifecta. No, no, no. It's not even April yet. Like, I… I can turn this around. I just… This year is… I've been distracted... Whatever you've been distracted with, I hope it's worth your future. Because that's what it cost you. Can I please be excused? Yup. I felt violated all over again. There was only one person sadistic enough to send that article. It was clear. Max was hunting me for sport. Yale was the only thing keeping me from going for his throat, but it was open season now. I had nothing holding me back, and I was prepared to burn it all to the ground. Oh my God. I'm so sorry. We can try again. Yale rejected me. No, no, no. Don't do that. Don't pity me. And definitely don't touch me. God. It's not just Max. It's all of them, Tara, Meghan, Montana, Elliot. Every one of those trust-fund fucks who I used to be friends with, they just stood by while Max ruined my life. I've lost everything, Eleanor. Fucking everything! What are you saying? You want to go after all of them? Yes. Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying. They need to feel the consequences of what they did to me. Taking away my social status, that's one thing. But taking away Yale? Oh. They have to pay. All of them. - Fuck. - So, um… What do you wanna do? Please tell me you got into at least one Ivy. Brown and Columbia, bitches. Should we tell her? Tell me what? Every year, there's this epic party. It's called the Admissions Party. A night of pure debauchery. No social media. No phones. Cell phones are surrendered at the entrance from sundown to sunup. It's all-out madness. It's a Rose hill senior tradition. And the only way in is your Ivy acceptance letter. You're going to expose each one of those duplicitous assholes and destroy their futures. What about Max? We're gonna kill him. You're not serious? No, I'm not fucking serious. But Max is mine. I'm gonna get him to admit once and for all that he leaked that video. Something he can't spin his way out of. What do you say, pal? Hmm? Ready to take them down? I'm in. Spoiler alert, Drea snapped. When she lost Yale, a dark cloud settled over our friendship. She only cared about one thing, revenge. Where's the party happening? Max rented a house. - I don't have the address yet. - Bro. My birthday is tomorrow. Do you wanna maybe do something together? Yeah, sure. Get the address. I'm really glad you were down to hang. - You have quite the social calendar. - Yeah, it's been a weird year. Hey, are you okay? What's going on? I feel like I'm being eaten alive from the inside, actually. You ever look around and just think, "How did I get here?" Yeah. All the time. You run with a pretty intense crowd these days. It's as surprising to me as it is to you. You've also had quite the change this year. - The new fits, blond hair. - Hmm. It's rad. Don't get me wrong. But I'm still here for the Eleanor I met on the first day of school. I think she's really something. I'm sorry. The old Eleanor can't come to the phone right now. Why? Nah, but all this shit, it's just armor. You know? Like, here, mine is seeming incredibly secure of myself, when, in reality, my whole I-don't-give-a-shit thing is just a front so no one can tell I actually care so much. Seriously. I really like you. I wanna tell you everything. I really like you too. Shh. Drea? Is there someone there? Surprise! - Oh my fucking God! - Hey! - Happy birthday! - Happy birthday! - You scared me. - You all right? - You gonna shank us? - Oh no. I wouldn't... This is my birthday party? Happy birthday. - Here you go. - I can't believe you did this. - You did this for me? - Of course. You're our friend. In a shocking twist of events, it turns out everything I thought I hated was exactly what I always wanted. Sure, this started as me infiltrating Max's group to help Drea. But at this moment, I just felt like I was surrounded by my friends, and all it took to get them was me trying to ruin their lives. - Oh! Okay. - Show what you got. Pose it up! - Yeah! - Come on. Eleanor was really pissing me off. We made this plan. I helped her get what she wanted, and now when it was my turn, she ghosted me? - What's going on in that head of yours? - Hmm? - Hmm? - Nothing. Come here. I just need a little distraction from all the stress. Okay. I can do that. Fuck. So good. It's the birthday girl. We all having a good time. I came. Let's go to a party. Happy birthday, Eleanor. Drea's here. Oh my God. What is she doing here? I didn't know you knew Drea. We have a couple classes together. - What are you doing here? - What do you mean? I saw the party on Montana's Story. She still has me on Close Friends. Well, I'm sure that's by mistake. So hostile. I'm waving the white flag, Max. Look, can't we just put all this ugliness aside? I mean, you said you didn't leak the video, and I believe it. So, why are we still fighting, right? Yeah. - Yeah, you're right. - Great. I'm glad you're here, Dre. Have a good time. Max. Russ. Hmm. Okay. Ooh. Such a fun vibe. Um, can I just steal the birthday girl for a sec? - Mm-hmm. - Your house is so cute. Come on. Show me around. I feel like I don't even know you. Well, I think you handled that very well. How does she even have this address? Good question. Nice entrance. Yeah? Nice jacket. It was a gift. I can't believe you. What do you think you're doing? You don't answer my texts. What do you think you're doing? You come to my house. Are you okay? Are you? Because it's you I'm worried about, Eleanor. Those people do not care about you. They're not your friends. Oh, is that what this is about? You're jealous I'm with your old friends? Did you even remember that it was my birthday? No. Okay? I didn't. But, fuck, why would I know that? Because I told you yesterday. Because we spent an entire year together. Oh my God, you're pathetic. Can't you see what he's doing? None of this is real. This party? He's controlling you, dude. Every person in there will drop you the minute you do not serve them anymore. Are you any different? At least with Max, I got a birthday party out of it. Wait, wait, wait. You don't like him, do you? Because he leaked that video, Eleanor. He leaked that video. Are you sure? There's never been any evidence. Take that back. No. I mean this from the bottom of my heart. Fuck you, Eleanor! Go home, Drea. Gabbi. Did you overhear that? I'm sorry. Drea is... Yeah, I know Drea. And… I love my brother. But… you know he leaked that video. You said some pretty messed-up stuff out there. It's complicated. Hey, I guess we solved the mystery of Eleanor, though, right? This isn't your armor anymore. It's just you. Fuck, I can't believe I was wrong. Happy birthday, though. I'll see you around. Paul's Auto. Hi. Oh my God. I'm so happy you're still open. Um, this is Drea Torres. You fixed my teal Mitsubishi earlier this year. I'm late to pick up my mom from work, and my car is not starting up, and I'm worried it's the same issue. Yeah, last time, someone removed your spark plug. That's why it wouldn't start. Wait. What? Why would someone do that? Are they worth something? They're worth about 20 bucks. Someone was probably messing with you. You got a jealous ex-boyfriend who can fix cars? Something like that. There was only one way to get to the bottom of this. I needed information only one girl would have. And it wasn't Erica Norman, the girl I allegedly framed at tennis camp. This was just a fun surprise. Drea. I hate surprises. Erica. Wow, hi. How are you, girl? You know, got kicked out of tennis camp. Yeah. Lost my scholarship to Stanford, and I developed an actual coke problem. Oh no. - So what are you doing here? - I came to see a friend. You know, I'm really glad that I get to see you, 'cause… …one of the steps in my recovery program is to make amends with the people who I've hurt. So… …Drea… Yeah. Okay. Drea, Drea, Drea. Yep. From the bottom of my heart… I wish you nothing but the worst for the rest of your miserable fucking existence. And… I love your ear balls. I love them. Thank you. She's waiting for you on the lower level. Great. Erica… So good to see you. - Hmm. - Hang in there, okay? Sleep with one eye open, bitch. - Erica, return to craft time. - I'm fucking coming! Drea. I wanna talk to you about Eleanor Levetan. She's been ignoring me all year. I almost didn't recognize her. She certainly remembers you. It's kind of hard to forget your first crush. She was sort of my first girlfriend back when she went by Nora. Nora? Yeah, Nora. She had the nose job and the name change, but hey, I think they're both working for her. Nose job? Wait. She told me that you started some fucked-up rumor about her that she kissed you and that you literally destroyed her life. - She told you that I did that? - Mm-hmm. That is so weird. First, that she told you it was me, and second, that you didn't immediately call bullshit. Why would I call bullshit? You seriously don't remember? Drea, you were the one who started that rumor. What? Yeah, Eleanor is Nora Cutler, from day camp. Nosy Nora Cutler. Oh my God! Nosy Nora. Yeah, she came out to me, and I… I… She told everyone that I tried to hold her down and kiss her. She turned me into this predator. I don't wanna make her pay. I wanna burn her to the ground. Oh fuck. You can't sit around like this all summer. Not again. Mom? What about tennis camp? In Palm Beach? Next up. I'll go. I wish we could, like, hire people to take them down. What, like a fucked-up TaskRabbit? Exactly. Listen, was all this a little crazy? Sure. But I'm a teenage girl. We're psychopaths. After the ring dinner, I decided to call it all off. Drea really seemed like she'd changed, and I didn't wanna hurt her. She was becoming my friend. But after she kamikazed into my birthday party, I realized Drea hadn't changed. She was the same mean girl I met when I was 13, and she deserved everything that was coming for her. Mom. Hi, friend. Oh. I'm sorry. Did you have a tough day? Your mom had an emergency shift, and she told me you were gonna be alone for dinner. And that felt sad, so I made you dinner. You probably poisoned it, Nora. Hmm. So, do you remember Erica Norman? Of course you do. Well, I follow her on Instagram, and she posted the funniest story from rehab today. I know that Erica is in rehab with Carissa, and you're calling me Nora. So, is the cat out of the bag? Get out of my house. Thought so! Oh, sorry. Burned one's for you. So, I have some really exciting news. This whole thing, everything that we've been doing, I've had the upper hand the entire time. You made this pretty easy, I gotta say. But that's the thing. Narcissists are too focused on themselves… …to realize they're being played. You'll never get away with this. Nora. Coming after me, the optics of that aren't great. Rich white girl ruins life of scholarship student of color. Oh, you're so dramatic. Sit down. I'm in charge now. You had me destroy Carissa for no reason. And she said you guys actually liked each other. I did like Carissa. She was so freaked out when you turned me into a lesbian leper that she jumped back into the closet when I needed her most. As you well know, rumors are not harmless little comments. Somebody says something in person, someone repeats it online, and then it just grows and grows and grows until it follows you wherever you are. I didn't eat. I didn't sleep anymore. My parents had to send me to a treatment center. It was embarrassing. And the worst part is you don't even remember doing this to me. I told you the entire story, and you didn't know I was talking about you. What if I had remembered? "What if? What if? What if? What if?" I wish more than anything that you had, but you didn't. And I knew you wouldn't. Where does this game end, Nora? I lost Yale. There's literally nothing else you could take away from me. I mean, that's simply not true. I'm sure you'll get into a perfectly good college. I'm gonna make sure that you are stuck with your pain forever because I know that I'm stuck with mine. It'll be like our very own version of friendship tattoos. Except, you know, with trauma. Okay. So, here's the plan. You're gonna get back in with your little friends, and you're gonna go to the Admissions Party, and you are gonna push them to do the craziest shit they have ever done. And when it all gets leaked, it'll be traced back to an IP address on your computer. They go down. You go down. So simple, so fun. Except I can't go to the Admissions Party because I didn't get into Yale, remember? Give me a break, Drea. I mean, I just executed an elaborate revenge plan. You think that I can't doctor an admissions email? If you want to ruin me, Nora, go ahead. I'm not helping you. I was worried that you might be stubborn about this, and got me thinking about your mom. I've recently learned that it's incredibly easy to frame people for having drugs on them. Thanks for that, by the way. So, what do you think? Aside from the fact that this is all, like, targeting you, did I make revenge mommy proud? Oh, by the way, I, uh, told Russ what you did to Carissa. Bye. Russ? Look, I don't know what Eleanor told you, but I promise I can explain. Okay? I had no choice. The only reason I put drugs in Carissa's dinner is because I genuinely thought... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Drea, slow down. What are you talking about? I haven't talked to Eleanor. What? Drea? Drea! Hello? Hi. Hi. How are you feeling? Uh… I'm okay. Did you talk to Eleanor? Look, I don't know what she told you, but the revenge thing was just as much her as it was me. And I'm sorry about Carissa. I… I thought she hurt Eleanor. Turn yourself in. Right. You don't understand. Do you know what would happen to me if I turn myself in? I'm not Carissa, Russ. I'm not just gonna get sent to some glorified spa. I am very aware of the differences between you and Carissa, but you decided to drug the entire class. And those texts on Max's phone… You more than anyone should know how violating it is to have your information leaked like that. - He deserved it. - No, not him. All those poor girls you exposed that ended up collateral damage. Do you ever think about anyone other than yourself? I really wanted this to work, but it just doesn't. Did he just break up with you? I'm sorry. That's sad. Do you like this balloon? I was deciding between this and Elsa, but I kind of thought you weren't an Elsa person. Although, you are a frigid bitch. You're a psycho. It takes one to know one. I'm sorry that I hit you with my car. I was barely going 20 miles per hour. It was a love tap. It was just the last piece of the puzzle. Max and them, they were never just gonna let you back into their group. I needed to give them a reason to. And you know… …there's nothing vapid people love more than making other people's tragedies about them. Oh, don't cry. It's all right. Sorry. I wish it could have been different. Truly. I did it. Soon, Drea would be annihilated. What should have felt exhilarating just felt rotten. I… I was so lost. I barely recognized myself. I mean, look at me. I did a costume change after I hit Drea with my car, but it was just too late now. The only way out was through. Shut up. How did you know I'd be here? This was our spot. I just figured that you should have it this year. You needed it more. Thank you for that. How are you doing? I'm great. Yeah, I'm having a blast. I miss you. I made some really bad choices this year. I let social politics overcomplicate things that should have been extremely simple. It shouldn't have taken an accident for me to realize that, and I'm sorry. I know you're gonna tell me to get lost when I say this, but… I think you're lucky. What? You got out. You're free, Drea. I don't feel free. I feel like I got hit by a car. Oh, wait. I did. I give up. I'm done. I'm sorry, but no. Nope. You're Drea fucking Torres. You're the girl who taught me what it means to be an indomitable force. I refuse to believe that girl's dead! She's not dead. Come to the Admissions Party and show everybody at Rose hill what a bad bitch looks like. I have a present for you. Is there a camera on that brooch? Yeah. But it matches your dress, so… You're welcome. Don't forget, Nora. I created you, and I can just as easily destroy you. Yeah! Yo, we got Mayweather… Yo, we got Mayweather-Logan part 2.0. I'd be very mad if this ends like that. Does anybody want to do some K? - Oh yes. - Gimme. Please. Gimme, gimme. - Drea? - I'm good. - Come on. Have some. - No, I'm good. Come on, Dre. Do some K. Don't be a narc. You guys, can we all just look at Eleanor right now? You are so pretty. Isn't Eleanor so pretty? - Yes. - So pretty. I love Eleanor. You're so pretty. So do I. - Eleanor, you're so bad. - Yeah. You're gonna hook up with both Broussards? I thought you were into Gabbi. What? Do you like my sister? No. I… - Yeah. - Yes! - Oh my God! - Classic Eleanor. So full of surprises. Did you guys know that Eleanor used to go by Nora, and she went to Big Beach Day Camp with Tara and I? - Do you remember? - What? No? You don't remember? Well, I guess she looked a little different. Here. How about now? Look familiar? Oh my God! - Oh my God. - We used to call her Nosy Nora? - Yes! - Oh my God! Yes! Yes! Nosy Nora! - Fuck! That's Nosy Nora? - That's Nosy Nora. Guys, we shouldn't... No, we're not... - Eleanor, come back! - Nosy fucking Nora. No way! I wanna touch it! Oh man. Nosy fucking Nora. I got a boob job. It's fine, babe. It's all good. Eleanor. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I really thought I was different than them. Every time I did something mean, I told myself, "This isn't me." "This is just who I have to be to survive." But that was a fucking lie. It was just a story I told myself to make myself feel better about the fact that I was just a toxic bitch. Does any of this make you feel better? Because I'm fucking miserable. No, of course I don't feel better. I feel like shit. So do I! Fuck. What are you doing? No, no. Stop it, Drea. Drea, don't! None of this is gonna make us feel better, okay? We can't erase what we did to each other, but I don't wanna hurt you anymore, and I don't think you wanna hurt me either. The only times I ever felt happy this year… Were when I was with you. You might be the only real friend I've ever had. And I know this probably means nothing now, but… If I could go back in time to when we were kids… I would tell you, "You're the coolest person I've ever met." Because you are. And I will regret what I did to you forever. So, I'm sorry, Eleanor… For everything. Whoo! Wow. What a heartwarming display of female friendship. I'm kvelling. Did you just enter doing a slow clap, you cliché piece of shit? Oh, I'm a piece of shit? Okay. I think you should look in the mirror, Dre. 'Cause you ladies have been very, very busy this year, haven't you? How did you get that? You put your phone in a locked bag at my party. You didn't think I was gonna look through it? You really are the devil. Mean. It's upsetting that my entrepreneurial spirit has to be reduced to such petty name-calling. But back to you two. The texts. They're a great read. That was compelling shit. So, you two meet, and then Drea hatches this plan, but then you come to find out that Eleanor's been playing you the entire time? Like… …I did not see that coming at all. Also, I gotta... Eleanor, I thought we had a whole will-they-won't-they thing going on. Now I find out you were pretending? Sad. Where are you going with this, Max? What's your plan? Well… I put you through enough. I was just gonna let it all go. Really? No, not really. Why would I do that? I hate you. No, I know all your secrets now, so I'm gonna use all the resources at my discretion to absolutely annihilate the both of you. You know how Drea and I met? It was on the first day of freshman year. I was in the library, and I overheard someone just verbally eviscerating a teacher, and I just thought, "Who is that?" You were no one. You were just some transplant scholarship girl who looked completely out of place, and I welcomed you into my world. And then what did you do? You used me. Because no one would've given a shit about you if it wasn't for me, and there was no gratitude from you. There was no, "Thank you, Max, for making me matter." Honestly, that Teen Vogue video was my breaking point. Drea, you're a conniving, selfish sociopath who just uses everyone around you to get exactly what you want. And so am I. Which is the source of the problem, because… most people, if they met a clone of themselves, they would just be elated. But you and I, we would bury it alive. Which is what I had to do to you. So I told you I loved you. I got you to make that video. And then I sent it to the entire school. Was any of it real? I don't know. Was it? Okay. I'm gonna go back to my party now and do fucking coke off a girl's butthole… or her belly or something. I don't know. All right. Well, bye, Dre. I really will miss you. Why the fuck are you laughing? It's called double assurance, sweetie. Look it up. We got him. Goddamn, do I love you right now. Oh my God. Oh. So, we're okay? Yeah. I think so. Drea, I'm so sorry. No. It's okay. I think we might be fucked-up soul mates. I know I said taking him down wouldn't make us feel better, but… Oh. Let's do revenge. - Let's do revenge. - Yeah. Ooh, baby. Lay down, baby. It's been a long night, but you know what? You are a very lucky girl. - Who touched the aux? - What happened to the music? Stay here, baby. I'll be back, okay? You stay there. You lay down, all right? You can have some of that special stuff. Yo, Max! Hey, you guys stay there, okay? I'll be back. Elliot, you better not be putting on your goddamn music again, man. Do you know how Drea and I first met? Are you seeing this? - The first day of freshman year. - What is this? - I was in the library. - What is that? Anyone know what this is? …eviscerating a teacher. - What's happening? - …A conniving, selfish sociopath… What's going on? …uses everyone around you to get exactly what you want. Hey, guys, this is… this is a joke. I don't know what this is. But, hey, come on. Get the party going, huh? Get a drink, man. Get a drink. Get the music back up. - Elliot, where's the remote, man? - I don't know. Fucking help me find it! Max, baby! Babe, hey, hey! You looking for this? Oh my God, baby. Thank you so much. Oh my God. I love you so much. - You love me? - Oh my God. Yes, I love you so much. - Fuck you, Max. We're over. - Goddamn it. Fuck! Fuck! Say goodbye to your daddy's Senate career. - Are you threatening her? - Fucker! - Aw! - What are you doing, you stupid bitch? Ooh, I'm just enjoying the show. Guys, this isn't real. This is a joke. You guys, you know me. Elliot, tell them. Tell them. I think you should leave, man. Oh, wow. Fuck you, dude! - Step the fuck back. - Fuck you. You're fucking nothing without me. You'd all be fucking nothing! Guys, you're turning on the wrong person. You know, this was Drea and Eleanor. They did this. And they also drugged us all at the ring ceremony. It was them. They also leaked all my texts on Valentine's Day! It was them! It was fucking... They're psychos! You know, I'm fucking glad I leaked that video. Careful, Max. - Bye, loser. - Move. Don't let the patriarchy hit you on the way out. I thought you might like to know that Max Broussard has been expelled from Rose hill effective immediately. How thrilling. Thank you. As a result, unsurprisingly, there is a spot open at Yale. I can't promise anything, but I'd love to make a call on your behalf. Wow. Huh. You know, all I ever wanted for as long as I can remember was to get into Yale. But right now, in this moment, all I can think is… Who cares? I don't wanna be that person anymore. May I let you in on a little secret? Your whole life, you've been cocooned. Everything you've done, everything that's happened to you, it's brought you to this moment. And now you're a butterfly… …a beautiful kaleidoscope of trauma and resilience. I know it feels like hell, but… …you are never more alive than when you're 17 years old. Fuck figuring out who you're meant to be. Stay lost as long as you can. Let's go! Let's get out of here. Do you think it's, like, totally bonkers that we're missing graduation? If by "bonkers," you mean "amazing." That is what I mean. Also, who says "bonkers" these days? Hmm. Cool kids. Oh my God. Turn this shit up. Hey, spot thief. What's going on here? Um, I wanted to do something cute, like a grand gesture. But, um, I was waiting for you to walk by, and you… you didn't. So, I guess I fell asleep. So, I told Vice Principal Norris what I did to Carissa. Unfortunately, she's still expelled, as she was, you know, growing drugs. But I did tell him the truth. I talked to Drea. You did? Yeah, she told me everything. She did? Yeah. And… I dig it. What are you gonna do now? I think… I'm gonna join the Peace Corps. - Really? - Yeah. Wow. What do they do? - Um, you know, they… restore peace. - Mm-hmm. And lots of core work, you know, Pilates, yoga. Awful. Wait. How did you get in... Shh. Don't worry about it. And before I start my share, I just wanna thank everyone for this safe space. After all I've been through, it feels so nice to be part of a community that… really sees me. I love you guys.
