- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes No! No! No! No! No! Aha! Thou shalt die who sullied the name of a woman. Ta-da! - You're dead, Currie. - Yes, sir. - Then get me my breakfast. - Yes, sir. I must say, Mr. Vance, since you've gone into exercise, you're a changed man. - For the better, I hope. - Oh, yes, sir, yes, much better. - In fact, you've become quite human. - Thank you. - I return the compliment. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. What do you make of that letter, Currie? From my experience, I can say it emanates from some hysterical female. I had a wife one, my second... No, my fourth, who was always writing letters to frighten the king of Siam. Well, get the New York telephone book and see if Lynn Llewellyn's number is in it. Yes, sir. Is that the Llewellyn residence? Is Mr. Lynn Llewellyn at home? Any of the family? I see. If they are all out, ask where they can be reached. Where? Oh, thank you. Goodbye. The butler said that Mrs. Llewellyn senior frequently goes... ...to Branch's auction rooms about this hour. - Branch's. - Yes, sir. Get my hat and coat. Ladies and gentlemen, have you ever seen anything so exquisite? The sensitive contour of the lips. Note the delicacy of the coloring. You might even say it's the god of love in person. Quiet, please, quiet. Do you realize that this magnificent figurine... ...was ceated by an artist in the reign of Louis Quatorze? A genuine French piece. Adolph, tell the ladies and the gentleman what's stamped on the bottom? Made in Japan. That's right! This glorious piece of Oriental art was created in Japan for Louis Quatorze. I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, I have never put up an object I was more anxious to sell. Thank you. Do you happen to know if a Mrs. Llewellyn is here? Sorry, sir, I'm a new man. Regard these lines, these lovely curves. It might almost be a lovely piece of Limoges. Just picture that exquisite masterpiece in the corner of an elegant salon... ...supporting in it's arms a bunch of pussy willows. I have a bid of four. Four fifty. Look out or you'll get it. Four fifty, going at four fifty. Five. - Six. - Ah, six dollars. That gentleman knows what this glorious specimen of art is worth. Going, going for six, I said going, going, going... Let it go! Six fifty! - Eight. - Nine. Ten and a half. - I won't bid another cent! - Do I hear eleven? No, I don't. Going, going... Sold for ten dollars and fifty cents. Adolph! And I've just lost my heart to that Cupid. That's good hard cement, Adolph, huh? Yes, sir, I'll be careful. But I don't want you to be careful. When I count three, drop it. One, two, three. Three. Thank you, Adolph. Ooh! Ooh! But if you didn't want it, why did you keep her from getting it? Um... Because the man who destroys a monstrosity like this... ...does more for art than the man who creates a masterpiece. Doris! Oh, please, let me carry it. I wouldn't trust you. Going... gone! Sold for twenty to the lady in blue. - Uh, those ladies who just went out. - Mrs. Anthony Llewellyn and her secretary. Llewellyn? Ladies and gentlemen, I have a great surprise in store for you. An error has been made. My apologies. The gorgeous figurine just sold was listed as a single... ...when it was really one of a pair. The only pair of this design in the whole world. Now, what am I bid for this wonderful masterpiece of ceramics? Oh, Miss Doris, such excite... Mercy, she's been junking again. I'm afraid so, Becky. - Where's the family? - Where ain't they. What a morning. - Fighting as usual? - Worser, I'm all in pieces. Bring them all in, now, put them wherever you are, and be careful. I'm going to put them down somewhere and don't drop them. Be very careful. Bring them in now, here... I think I'll hang this deer head in the hall. We need a hatrack. Oscar! Where did that man go? Smith! Smith! Smith! There are five servants in this house... ...and there is never one here when I need him. Well, Smith's upstairs bringing down young Mrs. Llewellyn's trunk. Trunk? What trunk? Just leave it at the foot of the stairs. What are you doing with that trunk? Sending it to Chicago. I'm opening there Wednesday night. Singing and dancing lead in Havana Rose. You'll do nothing of the sort. Smith, you take that trunk back upstairs! Yes, Mrs. Llewellyn. Lynn! Lynn, you come down here at once! Yes, Mother, I'm coming. Here, help me off with this thing. She's trying to stop me. I tell you it's no use... When you married Lynn, it was understood that you were to leave the stage. - Well, I've changed my mind. - Mother... Oh, a can't stand this madhouse any longer. Smith, bring that trunk down! Yes, Mrs. Llewellyn. If I hadn't given up my career to marry your precious son, - I'd be a star by now. - Oh, must we go through that again? I told Virginia it would make me ridiculous, but she doesn't care. She's determined to leave in the morning. Oh, I'm sorry, Lynn, it's not all your fault. It's your mother, she runs everyone ragged. I do nothing of the sort. Smith, you take that trunk back upstairs. - Yes, Mrs. Llewellyn. - Smith, don't you do it. Yes, Mrs. Llewellyn. - Do you have to make such a racket? - What's the matter? Can't you hear yourself dream? Hey, Smith, go easy with that trunk! - What's the idea anyway? - I'm clearing out. Lucky dog, I wish to heaven I could. Amelia, you don't want to leave your mother... ...and your beautiful, beautiful home. Doris, Doris, what did I do with my deer head? - It's right there, Mrs. Llewellyn. - Mother, you haven't been to another auction? Yes, dear, the Bertie estate. I used to go there as a girl in '86. No... '87, or was it '89? Oh, beautiful things. Virginia, dear, you come and look after this one. Here, dear. Hurry, come on, child. Come on, dear. There you are. Now, take over the... The doctor... oh, it's the doctor. There. If you're good, I'll give it to you and Amelia for a wedding present. Smith! Smith! Where is that man? Here I am, mum. Put that down and bring the steps. - The steps? - The ladder, stupid. Come, children, let's find places for the things. Come on, come on, dears. Come along, come along, - - - Oh, Richard, I didn't know you were here. - I knew you were here. - And look at what we've got. - More rubbish. - You've no soul for art. Smith! Smi... oh, there you are. Smith, uh... take that box off the table. And Amelia, dear, try the lamp there. What's this I've been reading about your going back on the stage? If you've any objections, you can keep them to yourself. I've heard about all I can stand from your sister. Now, there, hm? No, not there. Beg your pardon, a gentleman to see you, Mrs. Llewellyn. Put the vase back, I'll try to find a place for the statue. Where will I put it? The table's too low. Smith, put it on the mantle. A gentleman to see you, Mrs. Llewellyn. Oh, no, no, we can't have that half-nude woman next to Father. Oh, he wouldn't mind. A gentleman to see you! Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? - Mr. Philo Vance. - Vance? - Vance? Why, that's the detective. - Hm? Well, tell him we don't want any. But, Mother, he isn't an ordinary detective, he's a gentleman. Huh? Oh, well... um... Show him in. But tell him to leave his gun outside. You look perfect fools holding those things like that. For goodness' sake, put them down somewhere. My Cupid! - Permit me, Mrs. Llewellyn. - Oh, how ever did you get it mended? There is no effort I'd spare for an art lover like you. Oh, thank you. Smith. Smith, come and take this. Doris, the flowers. Now, where shall I put it? Where shall we put it? Where would you put it, Richard? In the ashcan! Excuse me, Vance... Oh, Kinkaid, how are you? - How is the casino? - Fine, we haven't seen you there lately. I've been out of town. Thanks for the invitation. Invitation? Yes, didn't you write me a letter asking me to be there tonight? No. Perhaps my advertising man. Oh... undoubtedly. - How do you do, Mr. Llewellyn? - How do you do? We haven't met, but I've seen you at the casino. I hope I haven't walked in at an inopportune time. - No, no, no indeed. - It's all my fault, Mr. Vance. - Do you remember... - Well, bless my soul! Virginia Lake. I'd forgotten you married a Llewellyn. She seems to be forgetting it herself. I'm sorry, Mr. Vance, we're a little upset. Upset? Why the poor dears are crazy, that's what's the matter with them. Crazy as bedlam. Ask Dr. Kane here. Excuse me, Mr. Vance. Dr. Kane, our family physician. - How do you do? - How do you do? He's my daughter's fianc?, and has done wonders for my sciatica. This is my daughter Amelia. - How do you do? - And my secretary, Miss Reed. - We've met before. - Yes, I remember. You were having a smahing good time. Oh, Mrs. Llewellyn, are you going to need me any more? - Not until teatime. - Then I'll do those errands. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye, dear. - I must run along too. - See you soon at the casino? Very soon. Are you still playing the Labouch?re system at roulette? Yes, but I'm trying something new tonight. Well, good luck to you both. We can't both have it, when he wins, I lose. Anyway, it's all in the family. Yes, it's all in the family. Well, goodbye. Nice to have met you. - Goodbye. - Charming young man. May I drop you somewhere? Well, um... would the Astor Library be out of your way? Oh, not at all. Delightful weather we are having. - Delightful. - I trifle cool in the morning, though. Yes, and at night. Also it rained last week and the week before and it might rain tomorrow. That settles the weather now, doesn't it? Suppose we get down to business. You're not fooling me a bit. You didn't come just to bring that figurine. No? No. And you're not taking me to the Astor Library. - No? - No. Something of a detective, aren't you? That used to be my ambition in school. To be a lady detective. That's why I always read the books about your cases. - Did you like them? - Loved them. Of course they're a trifle long-winded in spots. Oh... thank you. You're welcome. Mind telling me what you're doing? I'm kidnapping you. You must have a pretty good reason for this. I have. Miss Reed, through no fault of our own, you and I have become involved in a situation as incalculable... ...as a performance of the Commedia Dell'Arte. One might call it a macabre symphony of cacophonous discords. Debussy. No, no... more like Stravinsky. - Do you follow me? - At a little distance. You know, that's how I always thought you talked. You do in your books. Of course I always skipped those parts. Well, we'll do the same. In plain English, I am taking you to my apartment to meet the district attorney. Is it as serious as that? It's as serious as murder. Oh! Oh, you're getting smart, eh, you bully. You great big bully, I'll show you! Take that, and that. See how you like this. You big stiff! And now, how would you like this, you great big stiff! Ouch! You got me that time. I'm sorry, Mr. Vance, I wasn't expecting you so early. You may serve us some tea. Yes, sir. Scotch or rye? Orange pekoe. - You heard the lady? - Yes, sir. Mr. Markham is coming at three, sir. Oh, thank you. Nice little hut you have here. Yes, I built it myself out of palm leaves. Any trouble with the natives? Oh, yes, at first they attacked me with bows and arrows. But I drove them off. - Cigarette, or candy? - Oh, both, thanks. Well, you'd better start justifying yourself for bringing me here. - Aren't you having a good time? - Hm-hmm. Lovely. But you promised me a district attorney. - Ah, for dessert. - Oh. Sit down. First tell me about the Llewellyns. Well, you've just had a glimpse of them. Oh, I mean when they are not running temperatures. Their temperatures always run around 105. Oh. Hello, Markham, got my message, hm? Surely you're not taking that letter seriously. - Why, aren't you? - Certainly not. Why, it's absurd, ridiculous. Only dropped in for a glass of your Napol?on 1811. Miss Reed, this is District Attorney Markham. - How do you do? - How do you do? Miss Reed is a friend of the Llewellyn family. He's being tactful, I'm Mrs. Llewellyn's secretary companion. But I grew up with Lynn and Amelia. And what does Miss Reed think of your letter? That's why I brought her here, to find out. - Sit down. - Why, it's from Closter. The family has a farmhouse out there. - Oh, really? - Hm-hmm. Well, read the letter. I can see you don't believe it's a joke. A joke? To think someone who knows as well as I know Lynn may be murdered any minute? It doesn't say murder. - It says to prevent an awful tragedy. - The usual bombast. We get letters like that every day at headquarters. Yes, the epistolary complex. A mixture of pure egomania, cowardice and... - Ah-ah... there you go. - Oh, I'll skip it. - Will you pour, please? - Surely. But this letter doesn't fall into that category. What do you see in it that I don't? - Sugar? - One lump, please. Well, the envelope is smeared, the typing... Is bad, even I can see that. Exactly. Which means it is intentionally bad, to lead us astray. - How will you have yours? - Straight, please. Oh, Currie, the Napol?on. Excuse me. But, do you notice that the As and Is are worn and M is out of line?. Hm-hmm, yes... Why... why, that was typed on my machine. - I thought it might have been. - Who uses your machine? Oh... Amelia for her letters, Lynn for his business. Almost everyone in the family. Except Mr. Kinkaid, he's told me he can't type. Now, Miss Reed, do you remember seeing anyone use your machine yesterday? No. No, I don't. I used it myself to type a legal paper for Mrs. Llewellyn. Was it by any chance a will? Well, yes. How did you... Someone on the wire wants to know whether you're going to be... ...at the casino tonight, Mr. Vance. - Man or woman? - I can't tell, sir, the voice is so faint. All I could get was that it is a matter of life and death. Stall him while I get downstairs to the desk. I'll have the call traced. Hello, Vance speak... Hello. Hello! - Hello. - Rang off, eh? Yes. Currie, if they call again, tell them I'll be at the casino tonight. - Yes, sir. - And, um... Currie. You might mention that Miss Reed will be with me. Yes, sir. That's the twirler around. Want to try it? No, not just now, I'm a bit out of practice. - Hello, Vance. Good evening, Doris. - Good evening. Did you send for me? - Yes, I have something to show you. - A wine for Mr. Kinkaid. - No, thank you, I need my head tonight. What do you say to this? I say whoever wrote this knows a devilish lot about our family. - It was written on our machine. - I'm not surprised. Nothing would be too crazy for a Llewellyn. Not even murder? Not even murder. Do you think anything's likely to happen to Lynn tonight? - You're hopeful. - It's not a bad idea. At times I've been tempted to bump him off myself. See you later. You'll have to admit he's frank about it. I wonder. Oh, shall we twirler around a bit? Yes, let's. Only not over your head to start with. - Let's sort of ease into it. - Coward. Heath, what are you doing here? - Mr. Markham sent me. - Miss Reed, this is Sergeant Heath. - How do you do? - Hi. Is there more to him than his head? Oh, yes. Come on out in the open. Well, Mr. Markham told me to come here looking classy. - Hm, very smart. Imported? - No, rented. - Did you get a banjo with it? - Are you kidding me, old timer? Say, Mr. Markham'll be here later. Tell me, what do you know about the murder? - Oh, a lot. - What? It hasn't happened yet. What kind of a murder is this? Well, the victim hasn't even arrived. Okay, boss, I'll take charge, but you keep your eyes open. You know, he's been a help to me in many of my cases. - You don't say! - He's got a great brain. - Thanks, sergeant. Thank you. - None of that, shorty. Excuse, please. Mr. Llewellyn he come. Take off hat. Oh, thank you. Pick him up, Heath, and tail him in. - Watch him every minute. - Okay, boss. You and I can always go through the bar. - Hello, Lynn. - Hello, Doris. - Hello. - Hello. Say, listen, be a good kid and do something for me. Oh, you don't have to tell me. Virginia, and your mother in each other's hair again. Angel. I'm afraid Mother will have another one of her attacks, will you? I'm practically there now. You don't mind, do you? I'm the only one that can stop them when they get started. You'd better go then. - Leaving so soon? - Stormy weather at home. The car will drive you back. I'm a brute to spoil your evening. You are a nice brute. Excuse me. You will watch over him, won't you? Nothing's going to happen. I wish I were as sure of it as you are. I have a feeling that there is a malignant conjunction of diabolic forces afoot. Skip it. - I'll see you out. - Good night. Good night. - Who's that? - Oh, Smith. You frightened me. Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Doris. I was just checking up. - Everything quiet? - I hope so, miss. But it's been awful. Madam and young Mrs. Llewellyn had it hot and heavy for an hour. - Then Miss Amelia mixed in... - I don't hear anything now. The ladies wore each other out. It's all right, Smith. You may go to bed. Thank you. I was just phoning my mother. - I've got the heebie-jeebies. - Nonsense, Becky. Run along and go to bed, I want to use the phone. Yes, ma'am. But honest, this house gives me the cold chills. Oh, dear. Hello, is this the casino? Yes, you want Mr. Vance? Who is name, thank you? Miss Reed? You bet you my life. I get him, please. It's number two black. - Boy! - Yes, sir? You brought me soda. You know I only use plain water. - Rotten service you've got here. - He's alive and kicking. - Go on, snap into it. - I'll get some from my office. Twenty-seven red. Place your bets. Number nine red. The luckiest guy in the joint. Mr. Vance. Miss Reed want you on telephone, thank you please. - Where? - He can take the call in my office, Taki. This way, excuse me. I'll play red again. Place your bets, place your bets. Seventeen black. Yes, General, everything's under control at this end. Same here. I've been all through the house. No, not a soul stirring, not even a mouse. All right, I won't worry. - What's that? - There seems to be something wrong. Hold a while. Water! My head! Vance! Doctor! - What's the matter with him? - Taki, quick, get Dr. Rogers in the bar. Let's take him in there. Mr. Vance! Mr. Vance! Oh... what is it? Eyes staring, pupils dilated, muttering delirium. And that looks like the beginning of a pinpoint rash. - Solanaceae? - One of that group. - Possibly mandragorin. - Enough to be fatal? I can't tell yet. - Let us send for an ambulance. - It's on it's way, doc. Good. I'll give him a stimulant. May I have some water? Yes, I'll get some. - Heath, get some water. - Okay. Never mind. You'd better take him into the lobby for the ambulance. Mr. Vance, excuse, please, but you leave lady hanging on telephone. Thank you. - Hello. - What happened? Poisoned? But... not dead. Wh-When will they know? Yes, yes, I'll tell them. Virginia! Mother! - What is it? - No, wait! Wait, don't hang up! Something's happening here. Hello, Miss Reed? Hello! Hello, what's that? What? Virginia? Get the doctor at once. Is it true what he tells me about Lynn Llewellyn? Worse, much worse, we must go to the house at once. - What happened? - It's Lynn's wife, she's been poisoned too. What? - Come on, fellas! - That's fine now. Hold it right there, that's it. - Hey, what's this? - Wait right there. - Mr. Markham, will you... - No, I won't. - Mr. Vance, will you then... - No. I'd like you gentlemen on the stairs. Take the sergeant. The public is entitled to see him in that suit and hat. Why, certainly. Wait a second now, fellas, don't get excited now. - Here we go. Shoot the works. - Alright, hold it, sergeant. Thanks, Sgt. Heath. - Oh, I'm so glad you came. - How is she? She... She's dead. Take it easy. Get a hold of yourself. Yes... I'm all right. Oh, Allan, Allan. Mrs. Llewellyn, here's Mr. Vance and Mr. Markham, the district attorney. Where is my son? What have you done with him? He was at the casino, why isn't he with you? Oh, where, where is Lynn? Now, Mrs. Llewellyn, you must calm yourself. - Your son is ill. - His... his heart? No... poison. But not serious, we hope. He's been taken to the Lenox hospital. - Where are you going? - To my son. I must see him at once! I'm sorry, Mrs. Llewellyn, but you can't leave the house. - He's getting the best of care. - And we need you here, dear. Come, dear, I'll get her some coffee. Did you call, ma'am? Come along, now. Down here. Come on, dear, we'd better go too. Just a minute, who found young Mrs. Llewellyn? I did. I was reading in my room and... ...when I heard a sound as though someone were choking, I hurried in here and saw her. - Oh, darling. - Come on, dear. Oh, Dr. Kane. When you arrived, was Mrs. Llewellyn still alive? No, she was dead, her eyes were staring. The pupils were so dilated I could hardly see the retina. You see, same as young Llewellyn. Undoubtedly some poison of the Solanaceae group. Duboisine, mandragorin, or perhaps daturine. Hey, Mr. Markham, here's Dr. Doremus. Come on, Doc. How are you? Say, when I'm not called to examine cases at mealtime, I'm dragged out of a sound sleep. - Well, I didn't kill her. - How do I know? Ah, why don't you stop? Why is it that people always wait until all hours of the night... ...to get themselves bumped off? No feeling, no consideration. And you. Couldn't you wait till morning to find her? Then you would say we had spoiled your breakfast. - Dr. Doremus, this is Dr. Kane. - Glad to meet you. - Well, well, where is it, where is it? - There. Oh, Heath! Dress it as it was, Sergeant. Round up the servants and see what you can find out. I'll take the family. Okay, boss. Mrs. Llewellyn, I'm sorry to trouble you at such a time, but would you mind telling me exactly what happened after Miss Reed... ...left for the casino tonight? That was about nine o'clock, wasn't it? Nine thirty. Yes... I was tired... ...and decided to read in bed. So I started to undress with Becky helping me. That... must have taken about fifteen minutes or... ...perhaps a little longer. I was worried about my son. So I decided to have it out with my daughter-in-law before I went to bed. The room she occupied with Lynn was next to mine. I could hear that they were quarreling. My last night in town and you're running out on me. Throwing away your money in that rotten casino. Come in. Oh, it's you. Come to kiss your darling boy good night? Oh, be quiet, grudgy. I bought the candy for you, Mother, but she got it first. - Aren't I smart? - Virginia, I've come to have a little talk. Nuts cedars, I adore them. Nice big box at the train tomorrow, sweetie pie. Now, we've got to settle this thing once and for all. - Ugh, pistachio. - Oh, where, I like them. Will you stop eating candy when I'm talking to you? You're not going back on the stage and humiliate my son. Oh, aren't I? Just watch me. I wouldn't give up this part for the mint. Did I tell you? I'm a girl in Havana. In one of those dives. You know, I do a kind of a fan dance. Wait till you see, I'll knock them cold. - If you do this to us, Virginia, I'll... - You'll what? Lynn can't divorce me for going back on the stage. And besides... he doesn't want to. Do you, honey? How can you let that woman make such a fool of you and insult your mother? Ever since she came to this house there's been nothing but trouble. Oh, yeah? And why, because you've made it. You've come between Lynn and me ever since we were married. And if you don't stop, I'll spill what I found out about you. Oh, so you didn't think I knew, did you? But I do. Why, twenty-fice years ago you were... You wretched little spy! - You've been going through my letters. - Now, Mother, don't. Now look out, she's working herself into one of her spells. No, no, I'm all right. You go to the casino. I want to speak to Virginia alone. But I don't want to leave you. There won't be any more fighting, she's got it all out of her system. Run along, the casino's calling. All right, but take it easy, won't you, darling? Sure she will. Have a pistachio, darling. - Goodbye, dear, I'll be back early. - You're a liar. Did you call, ma'am? I returned to my own room with Virginia. And a little later, my daughter Amelia came upstairs. Where did you come from? From the library. I had spent the evening alone writing letters and I... Oh, no, Miss Amelia, you were in the bar with Dr. Kane. I know because I heard you... Excuse me, I'm all in pieces. Yes, Dr, Kane did drop in. I'd called him because I knew Mother and Virginia were arguing. I was afraid Mother might have one of her attacks. What sort of attacks? Hysteria. I've had them ever since I was a child. - And do you become violent? - Oh, no... I can tell you that because... Let me answer, Doris. She's trying to shield me. Yes, at times I do become violent. When I came upstairs, she was perfectly calm. Becky told me there was trouble and I went to Virginia's room. She wasn't there, but the door to Mother's room was open. Oh, thanks for the donation. It'll buy me a swell mink coat. If you keep out of my hair, I'll keep out of yours. Nighty night, sweet dreams. - Virginia. - Oh, now don't you start anything. Everything's hunky-dory. We had a row, we kissed and made up, and we'll go right on hating each other. - Have you got a drink around? - Sure, on the bureau. But save me a snifter. Look here, if you and Lynn can't hit it off, why don't you call it a day? - Do you want yours straight? - No, a little water. - Why don't you take a trip to Reno? - Reno? Not much. Say, when your mother joins the angels, Lynn can give me my share, go his way and I'll go mine. Until then if you don't mind, I'll take my monthly allowance... ...and sing I'll String Along With You. Yes? Well there won't be any shares left... ...if you don't keep Lynn out of Uncle Dick's casino. Don't worry, I can handle Uncle Dick. What I know about that guy. And I know a few things about your sweet little doctor too. What do you know? I know why he and Uncle Dick are getting so palsy-walsy. And what's more, I know what they were doing in Closter the day before yesterday. - And they know I know it too. - They weren't in Closter. Oh, weren't they? It must have been two other guys. Oh, take that bottle and get the heck out. Then she jumped into bed and put out the light. And she told me to get out of her room. And that's the last time I saw her. - Before I went in and found her... - Hush, hush, dear. They don't want you to go over that again. No. But you're quite sure you've told us everything, Miss Llewellyn? Oh, of course it's everything. Don't you see? I've even told you things that make it look bad for other people. For Mother, Uncle Dick and Dr. Kane. Because I know they're innocent. I know it! And I want to help you find out who killed Virginia. And tried to kill Lynn. - Mr. Markham, I've finished. - Oh, good. What did you find? Well, she didn't die of old age if that's what you mean. Dr. Kane has suggested that she might have died from a poison in the solanaceae group. Oh, any third-year medical student would know that. Hm, when's the soonest we can have the autopsy report? Eleven o'clock tomorrow if you let me go now so I can get some sleep. And nothing'll get me up again tonight, Mr. Vance. - Unless you get bumped off. - Thank you. Hey, hey, here's your order to remove the body. - Oh, doctor. - Yes? Do you happen to have any solanaceae in your bag? No, but I have some mandragorin. But it's empty. That's strange, I'm sure it was full yesterday. Was your bag in this house yesterday? Why, yes, I was prescribing for young Mrs. Llewellyn. - Oh, anything serious? - No, a little too much candy. Have you prescribed anything else for her? Yes, tablets for cold, eye wash, gargle. Did you prescribe this for Lynn Llewellyn? Yes, they're nitrites for the heart. Why are you questioning me like this? You're not inferring that... Mr. Vance! Mr. Vance! Mr. Vance, come here. There you are. I, uh... I solved the whole mystery for you. - You? - Yes, I got the guilty party downstairs. And you'll be surprised. Come on. You think I'm kidding or something? Right down here. I was passing the library and I looked in and somebody was robbing the safe. Certainly I was nervous. And there she was, stealing the other lady's will. Nothing like a hairpin for picking locks. I picked hundreds of them in my time. Was this your bright idea? No, give credit to the honorable Sgt. Heath. - Where is the key? - Oh, no, I caught her robbing the safe. - My orders. - Old fool. - The key! - Okay. - Who are you calling old fool? - Them the shoe fits can put it on. Give her the key... It's not here... it's not here. I'm sure I got it... there it is. It's been in my hand all the time. - What about them handcuffs? - Well, what about them? Well, anyway, I'm lucky the steam wasn't on. - Now get out, get out both of you. - With him? Come on, give me them keys, they're not for kids, come on. When I called you an old fool, I left out a word and if I wasn't a lady, I'd say it now. And leave the door open, Becky so no one can listen. Yes, sir, thank you, sir. I came down to get you this. I thought it might be of interest to you. Smart girl. "To my beloved son Lynn my house in Park Avenue" Bequests to charity. "The remainder to be divided between my son and daughter." But it's not signed. Oh, no. No, she wanted her lawyer to look it over first. She's going to see him in the morning. And the only ones who'd benefit by this when it's signed would be Lynn and Amelia. Hm-hmm. How does this differ from her former will? Oh, that split her fortune three ways. Between Lynn, Amelia and Mr. Kinkaid. - Kinkaid? - Yes. Oh, but that was before he started the casino. She's been furious at him ever since. - Surely that has nothing to do with... - I'm not so sure. If old Mrs. Llewellyn should happen to die tonight, Oh! Hello. What's this? Chemistry and toxicology. Poisons of the Orient. Webster's Legal Medicine and Toxicology. - Famous poison trials. - Oh, but they've always been there. History of Poison in Crime, by John Llewellyn. Mrs. Llewellyn's husband. Are you looking at Father's little love stories? Oh, yes. He was a chemist, wasn't he? And how. He taught me how to make cocktails. Come on, Doris, let's have one. - Oh, no, dear. - Aw, come on. All right. We've had plenty of trouble tonight, we're entitled to a few little drinks. - Cocktails or scotch? - Scotch, please. - You, Doris? - Nothing, thanks. Oh, Amelia, please, you've had enough to drink. I want to get drunk, so I won't think about Virginia. Do you realize that any one of us might have killed her? How do you figure that? Well... Well, there's Mother, see? And here's Uncle Dick. See how crooked he is? And there's Lynn and me. And here's you, Allan. Now, Mother might have killed her because she hated her. Jealous of Lynn. Darling baby Lynn. - Oh, dry up, Amelia. - Oh, I'm too dry already. And she has something on Uncle Dick, and on you too. Something she thought they wouldn't want known. Oh, why'd you let me make them so strong, I'm talking too much. Altogether too much. - Are you afraid? - He's afraid for me. He thinks maybe I did it and maybe I did. I never liked her! No one in the house ever liked her. Even Smith and Becky. - Did you call, ma'am? - Did you like her? No, ma'am... of course, I don't know who you mean. Now you see? And I'll tell you something else. Lynn didn't like her either. You didn't know that either, did you, Mr. Sherlock Vance? He was sick and tired of her nagging. Perhaps he did it. And then tried to commit suicide? Oh, no... No, I'd forgotten. Lynn wouldn't kill himself. Oh, I'm tired. - I'm frightened. - You'd better take her upstairs. Come on, dear. I'm all right. What am I doing here? I live here! Oh, Vance. What are the police doing out there? Mrs. Llewellyn has been poisoned. Poisoned, eh? Same as Lynn? Yes, but in her case it was fatal. They are bringing down the body. How long ago did my sister die? What makes you think it was your sister? You said Mrs. Llewell... You mean Virginia? Yes. - Do you know who did it? - Not yet. Mind answering a few questions in there? No. No, not at all. I'd like to know about those chemistry books over there. - Are they yours? - Some of them. I used to be interested in chemistry. Studied in Germany. But the war came and I gave it up. But how do some of these books happen to be published this year? I can't imagine. Is that all? I'd like to get to my sister. She'll want to hear about Lynn. Oh, yes, your sister. How long ago was she in the asylum? Never mind how I found out, just answer. Was it when her children were young? Yes. Babies. She was cured. Except for a change in her hysteria. - Oh, yes, I know that. - You know a lot. Yes, I do, don't I? Well, thank you, that will be all for the present. You get on my nerves. You talk too much. The whole family have talked too much. May I come in? It's Doris. Come in. I tell you there's a maniac loose in this house. And what ever happens, you're to blame. - How can you talk to me like that? - You should never have had children. You passed on tainted blood. I can't stand it any longer. I feel as though I were losing my mind. Becky? I'm afraid I've caught you in flagrante delicto. Oh, no, sir. It's a cape. She promised it to me. And besides, she won't be needing it anymore. Oh, ain't it grand? I've always loved feathers. Are you sure you haven't touched anything in here, Becky? Me? No, sir, I wouldn't think of it. Disinfectant, tooth powder, cold cream. The best I ever used. Gargle prescription, Dr. Kane. Eye wash, Dr. Kane. Yes, sir, she was always making eyes at him. It was here Miss Llewellyn found her. Yes, sir. I seen her too. She looked awful. Did you fill this tonight? Yes, sir, I fill them in all the bedrooms. Hello. What's this? Oh, that's just Mr. Lynn's firearm. Did he always keep it here? Yes, sir. Hm. It's loaded. What's that? Oh, just some candy she got this evening. This evening, eh? It's empty. Becky, you didn't take them? Well... I'm sorry, sir, but I've got a sweet tooth. - Come on, quick! - Where? Come on! But I didn't think there was anything wrong. Mr. Vance, it ain't a crime to take four little candies. Don't argue. Please, doctor, I want you to give her an ematic. Not until I see my lawyer. She's eaten candy which may be loaded with poison. We won't wait for an ematic, we'll pump her right out. - But, doctor, I didn't, honest I didn't! - I said not to argue! - Stop arguing and get pumped. - I told you to have that candy analyzed. How did I know she was going to eat it? - Ready, Becky? - No, no, no, wait! Here, take 'em. - I don't want them. - Are you sure you didn't eat any? - Honest, not a one. - Rush them down and have them analyzed. Mr. Vance! Stop her, stop her, she'll fall! Help me! Help me, I... Doris! Doris! I beg your pardon, sir, but you see, I've been practicing and I seem to have got the hang of it. You seem to have hung one on me. - I beg your pardon? - That was a joke, Currie. J-O-K-E. Well, never mind, just forget I said it. - Thank you, sir. - You may draw my bath... ...and tell Max to prepare my breakfast. Yes, sir. If that's Mr. Markham, I'm home, for anyone else, I'm in Afghanistan shooting rhinocerous. Yes, sir, Afghanistan, rhinoceros Afghanistan, rhinoceros. Afghanistan, hippopotamus. - Afghanistan... I beg your pardon, sir. - Good morning, Currie, is Mr. Van... - Oh, hello, Vance. - Hello, Markham. I've just come from the hospital. They wouldn't let me see Miss Reed, but she's out of danger. I thought that... Uh, Currie, hang that wrap in the closet. Yes, sir. Shall I serve the lady's breakfast in bed, sir? - Uh... - No, Currie. I'll eat with Mr. Vance. You should have called me when you got up. Oh, good morning, Mr. Markham. Good morning, I've just been down to the hospital to find out how you were. - Do tell me, how was I? - Oh, out of danger. Oh, good. It really wasn't so bad. Dr. Kane gave me some stimulants... ...and I began to recover as soon as I got into the air. Oh, Miss Doris. I beg your pardon, but do pack or do we go on living with Mr. Vance? - Oh, we'll decide it later. - Yes, sir. I left orders at the hospital to let everyone think she was there... ...and then brought here. Besides, I felt so nice and safe with him. - Oh, I resent that. - Oh, I did too, Mr. Vance. Never mind, Becky, go help Currie. Yes, miss. Mr. Vance, I hope I didn't snore. But when I sleep on my back, it's my adenoids. - Now, about last night. - Oh, yes, yes, about last night. I understand Mrs. Llewellyn was quarreling with Mr. Kinkaid. She collapsed and you brought her a glass of water. No, no, Mr. Kinkaid brought the water. Oh, Kinkaid, water. Please, tell me, would you rather have eggs au beurre noir... ...for breakfast or eggs chinois? Oh, eggs chinois. I used to make them with mushrooms and bacon. - Bacon? - Hm. Ham! Did Mrs. Llewellyn drink the water? No, no, I drank the water later with some aspirin. Pardon me, please. I always use bacon, it's crunchier. - It's crunchier? - Yes. - How is that? - Hm, lovely. - Say Uncle. - Uncle Vance. Oh, it's a strange thing, before I left the office, Doremus called. He said they could find no trace of poison either in the stomach or in the blood. But she was obviously poisoned. Mr. Markham, Llewellyn insisted upon stopping here on his way home from the hospital. Oh! Oh, Lynn, Lynn, you shouldn't have come. I would have come to you. Come on over there, sit down. I... I wanted to talk away from the house. Oh, poor Virginia. - Oh, it's his heart. Oh, Lynn, dear. - There's medicine in my bag. Oh... perhaps one of these. - How did you get those? - From your pocket last night. Do you mind telling me, did you take any of them before you collapsed? Yes, I took two just before Uncle Dick brought me that water. Hm. And who had access to this bottle? Well, my wife and my sister. Your mother? Well, everyone in the house, I often left it around. That's a big help. Three people almost bumped off and... - Three? - Yes, count them, three. And they almost got her. Yes, she collapsed right after your mother gave her aspirin. My mother? Hey, Vance, what are you trying to infer? - A call for you, Mr. Markham. - Thanks. Excuse me. Hello? When? How did it happen? Was there anyone in the room? You're sure? Yes, at once. Quick, Heath, get the car. Phone Doremus to meet us at Llewellyn's. - Doremus? - What is it? I'm sorry to have to tell you like this, but your mother just died. Died? - Someone killed her. - No. She wrote a confession, then shot herself. Well, we must get over there, come on. How did you happen to go out of the room? - I left orders... - Yes, sir, I know. But she asked me to get you on the phone, said she had something very important to tell you. While I was in the phone booth, I heard the shot and I... - Were you the first one in? - No, sir. Dr. Kane. I was calling to see how she felt. I was just outside the door when the gun went off, so I rushed into the room... - Did she say anything? - No, she was dead. The gun was lying here on the floor right under her hand. - Oh... where did she get the gun? - It's Mr. Kinkaid's. Yes, it's an old one. Oh, I haven't seen it in a long time. - I used to keep it in the library. - I see. Oh, Doremus! Yes, yes, I know what you want. Could she have shot herself? Yes, she could. Gun under her hand, powder burn on right side of forehead... ...showing muzzle was held close to head. - But... - But could anyone else have shot her? Yes, anyone in New York could have shot her, except me. - I was at home trying to get... - Trying to eat your breakfast. Nothing of the sort! I was shaving! Now, if you're through with me, I'll go back. I'll run along with you and close up the case at headquarters. Wait, Markham, make him take that note to a handwriting expert. Isn't it your mother's writing? Handwriting can be forged. And you accept the note as final evidence. You're going to let the one who did this go scot free and... and make people think that my mother... My mother was the murderess. What, she tells us so herself, Llewellyn. Take that to Rosencrans, tell him I want a report at once. Yes, sir, I'll try and do it sooner than that. - Come on, skinny. - Flatfoot. If that confession proves to be in her own handwriting, it may mean nothing. Absolutely nothing. - What's that? - I... I didn't say anything. Here. Thank you... I'm sorry. I can't help it. She was so good to me. Even when I was a child. Have you ever eaten... volleysugar? I think so. Isn't it like a stick of twisted white glass? Hers was twisted pink. She used to keep it in jars. Come on, let me put this here. Another time I shot the Minister. - What? - Hm-hmm. With Lynn's bean-shooter. He would pull my hair. Everyone else scolded me, but she gave me a nickel for taffee. You don't think a woman like that could murder anyone, do you? No. Honestly, do you mean that? Honest. Your breakfast, sir. We've been keeping it hot. Oh, I couldn't think of eating. But that smells kind of good... Well, I guess I'll just have a cup of coffee, please. Try the eggs, miss, they're not half bad. Just a taste. This whole affair puzzles me. - I'm sure you'll like this, Miss Reed. - Thank you. This shooting in the middle of a poison mystery, it's out of drawing. Just like a few brush strokes by Picasso in the center of a... ...of an Andrea Del Sarto Piet?. - All right, let's skip it. - Did I say anything? You know, you're right, ham is better than bacon. Please go on, that is, if you know where you're going. Oh, yes, I'm beginning to see a few signposts. Not many, but enough to see where they are pointing. - Where? - That's the trouble. They may have been put up deliberately to lead us in the wrong direction. These tomatoes weren't ripe enough. - You wouldn't listen to me. - Becky! Yes, ma'am. Yes, we must find the wrong direction in order to discover the right. Tell me, what would you call a signpost? - Sausages? - No, thanks. Well, that letter which came before the murder. Mailed at Closter. Is anyone living in the old Llewellyn house? No, no. But Mr. Kinkaid and Dr. Kane use it as sort of hunting lodge. That is, they keep the electricity and the water turned on. Well, that's another signpost, water. Yes, sir. Water. Water runs through every act of this devilish drama. Lynn drinks water at the casino from Kinkaid's caraffe. Virginia empties her water bottle before she dies. I drink water from Mrs. Llewellyn's thermos and I'm poisoned. Yes, water, water everywhere. H2O. By Jove! I wonder. It might be worth investigating. - Currie! - Yes, sir. - Order the car and get me my coat. - Yes, sir. - Where are we going? - I didn't say anything about you. No, it's a long drive and it looks like rain. - I brought along her raincoat. - Aha! I'll be dressed in a jiffy. - Come on, Becky. - Oh, no, now... - The car is on its way now, sir. - Good. Get me the address of Dr. Kane's office. Physicians and Surgeons' Building. Thank you. Oh, speaking of chemistry, doctor, I'll tell you what brought me here. Happen to know any drug... ...which might have an effect similar to one of the solanaceae group, but wouldn't be detected in the stomach or in blood in a post-mortem? - Something like mandragorin or henbane? - Yes. I'll take a look in the pharmacopeia. How about heavy water? What do you mean? I've been reading about that new chemical, heavy water. You know, that won the Nobel prize for his discoverer, Dr. Urey. I believe they are doing a lot of research work on it at the Princeton laboratory. Do you know anything about it? No, nothing. But it's not poison. At least nobody knows, it's never been tried on human beings. Just experiments on fish and animals and things like that. Sorry you know nothing about it. Well, I won't take any more of your time. Oh, it's going to rain. It's too bad, I'm starting for the country. - A long trip? - Oh, no, just up to Closter. - Doctor, Mr. Kinkaid is on the phone. - Just a minute. - Well, I'm sorry I couldn't tell you more. - Oh, you've told me a lot. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hello. Hello, Kinkaid? Listen, Vance has just left. - I took a taxi. - Well, of all the impudence... Now, I know everything you're going to say, so skip it. Uh, delightful weather we're having. Oh, yes, delightful. Oh, there's the house. - I'll take a look. - I'll look too. Oh, no, you stay here and listen to a little music. I don't want any music. You lucky girl. It's Les Pr?ludes by Liszt. - I'd rather hear Ted Lewis. - Oh, Ted Lewis. Oh, how magnificent. Ah, that dythrambic stridency... that... That pouring rain, ah! You're hopeless. Vance! Vance! Where are you? Oh! What's the matter? Oh, n-nothing, I... I just got a little tired of your pal Liszt. All the windows are boarded and the doors padlocked. - Oh. - But I found this entrance to the basement. Entrance? That's the coal shute. You mustn't call names. Now go back to the car. - I'll investigate. - Oh, yes, indeedy. You don't know what you're sliding into. I will in a minute. I'm coming too. Catch me now. Alley-oop! - Thanks. - Shh! I heard something. You haven't heard half you're going to hear too. Oh, look! - Now we're locked in. - Shhh! Oh, I don't like this. Let's not stay in here. It's all right. It's just what I expected to find. - What's it all about? - It's heavy water. C2O 90% of the molecules are oxygen combined with deuterium or hydrogen. Which is twice as heavy as in ordinary water. But what's it good for? That's what the scientists are trying to discover. And there is such demand for it in the experimental laboratories... ...that a quart is worth about a hundred thousand dollars. Oh, there must be a fortune tied up in this room. Oh, yes. Undoubtedly Kinkaid and the doctor... have worked out a secret process... ...and they've hidden the laboratory so no one would stumble on it. I suppose you expected this too. Something like it. Hello! Hello out there! Get out, or I'll shoot through the door. Listen, I'm Philo Vance. The district attorney knows where I am. If I don't appear in a half an hour, he'll send the police to search this house. - Is that true? - I wish it were. I advise you to let us out at once. - Quick, in there! - Oh, no, I won't go. If there's going to be any danger, Mr. Vance, I want get out, I won't stay here. Oh, Kinkaid. Would you mind pointing that the other way? My watchman thought you were a burglar. He has orders to shoot first and ask questions afterward. - Very wise precaution. - Give me that. Wait outside. Now, what brought you here? Signposts. I'm on the trail of water. Three people collapse and one dies after drinking it. And now I find you manufacturing heavy water. I still don't get what you're driving at. With the Llewellyns out of the way, you'd inherit a fortune. You weren't any too fond of your sister... ...and she was making a new will disinheriting you. All the signposts point in your direction. Oh, is that so? Well, my advice to you, Vance, is to accept my sister's confession as genuine... ...and forget the whole thing. What business is it of yours anyhow? The police have dropped the case, Virginia's dead, my sister's dead, you can't bring her back to life. And yet, you're planning to drag the family through the dirt. You have police running all over the house here. Broadcasting our secret process. I won't let you get away with it. So help me, I'll... Doris! Doris, where are you? Oh, thank heaven, I was just going for the police. - We won't need them. - Well, I hope you got what you wanted. You've got your hope. Those signposts pointing towards heavy water... ...were set up purposely to lead us in the wrong direction. - Oh, well, where are we going now? - In the right direction. The sooner we clear out of here, the better. That one leaves Wednesday. You might have the common decency to wait until Mother's buried... ...before you start planning a honeymoon. Wait, why should I wait? Mother never cared a hang about me. Everything was for you. Uncle Dick will take his share and ride out, ...why should I stick around this old mausoleum? Yes, why should we? We'll wait for the funeral, then we'll take a boat to the Mediterranean... ...or perhaps around the world. We? We will? Well, I certainly like the way you're spending my money. Look here, I'm about fed up with this. If you want to call it off... Stop it, both of you! It's mad. It's horrible to wrangle at a time like this. If you can't behave decently, you can get out of my house. Your house? That's right, it is yours. Mother left it to you. You're the master. I'll get out. I'll be glad to. I'm afraid to stay in the same house with you, do you hear, I'm afraid! Because you... You're the murderer... Pardon me, Miss Amelia, but we've already considered that possibility... ...in the servants' hall. And we find that Mr. Llewellyn was not at home when any of the fatalities occurred. Quite right, Smith. Mr. Llewellyn was at the casino when his wife was murdered. At the hospital when Miss Reed collapsed... ...and he was in my apartment when his mother died. If you know so much, why don't you find out who did do it? You come here peeking and prying and dragging out all the family secrets... ...and you don't do anything. You let us all be murdered. There will be no more murders, I can promise that. You can't mean you found the murderer. Who is it? Tell me, tell me! Not quite yet. I have here a brief summary of the case ready for the district attorney. It tells exactly who committed these crimes. Psst. Why they were committed and how. - Except in the case of your wife. - Psst! Then I find out the method used for poisoning her... Psst! Beg your pardon, Mr. Vance, but might I speak with you before you go? I will have the last bit of the puzzle ready to put in the prosecutor's hands. And I expect to have it before midnight. Mr. Vance... Before midnight. - Yes. - Before midnight. You asked me to tell you if I caught anyone a-smooching around the medicine chest. About an hour ago, I just happened to be passing in the hall, but I heard someone slam a door in here. Did you see who it was, Becky? No, miss, they'd hung a towel over the keyhole. And by the time I ran down to get the key, they'd snuck off. Hm, looks just the same. - Oh, no, hold on. - What is it? Something's changed, something's missing. Ah, this label... was out before, like this. I've got it! - I've got it! - Got what? The solution! Hello? Dr. Doremus? How is the post-mortem coming? Hm. You didn't find anything in the liver or kidneys? Oh, never mind about them, it's a... Wait. What's the matter? Someone listening on the extension down there. Shh! They'll hear you. I found the receiver off the hook, sir. I'll take it. Hello, doctor. Take a look at the eye tissues. Yes, and the brain. And the membranes of the nose and throat. I think you will find something interesting. - Well, I was right, eh? - There can be no doubt about it, Mr. Vance. Three tests I have made and all are positive. I tell you, Mr. Markham, the brain it was practically saturated. - With mandragorin. - Yes. Which must have been substituted for the eye wash prescribed by Dr. Kane. Well, that's all very interesting, but it's of no real importance... ...because we have old Mrs. Llewellyn's confession. But you've missed the most interesting part of it. She couldn't have murdered Virginia... because somebody poured out the mandragorin solution... and put the correct prescription back into that eye wash bottle... ...after old Mrs. Llewellyn was dead. But Mr. Vance, here's a report from the chirographer. He said this confession is written in Mrs. Llewellyn's own handwriting. Well, perhaps she was forced to write it at the point of a gun. I thought of that. Two great minds. Mr. Vance! Oh Mr. Vance! Been trying to locate you. Important message. He-He said very important. And I m-m-must get you at once. - Who said? - Oh.. I can't think of the name. But he said very important for you to meet him. All right now, Currie, now come on, sit down and relax. Yes, sir. And I can't think where. It'll come to me in a minute. Wait till I get my breath. And the name. It all begins with a C. Could it have been Kinkaid? That's it, sir. Closter, casino. Kinkaid. He wants you... he wants you to meet him at the casino at 8 o'clock. Well, why not at my office? Call him and ask him. I'm afraid I can't do that, sir. The call came from Closter. - He was just starting to drive in. - Was Kinkaid himself calling? I don't know Mr. Kinkaid, sir. But I'm positive it was the same voice that called yesterday... ...to ask if Mr. Vance was going to be at the casino. The same, are you sure? - Yes, sir. - Then I've got him. - What? - My fish, Mr. Markham. I was angling with a letter. This simple little letter. I didn't know when he's rise to the bait, but I knew it would come before midnight. Well, I'll leave that fishing to you. So far as I'm concerned, the case is closed. If you want to listen to your friend Kinkaid at the casino tonight, you can do it alone. - The whole idea is crazy. - Certainly it is, the casino's closed. - The servants are laid off. - That's right. - Did you say 8 o'clock? - Yes, sir, 8 o'clock. Good. - For me? - Yes, it came by special messenger. Excuse me. Oh! What is it? Nothing. Nothing at all. Hello? Yes. Yes. Yes. Wouldn't it be better if I went in with you? There might be danger, sir. You're an old woman, Currie. Remind me in the morning to knock you out. Yes, sir, thank you, sir. - Oh, hello. - Hello. I didn't expect to find you here. Uncle phoned me to come down. He's in his office with Kane. Oh. - What does he want of us, do you know? - No more than you. Oh, that reminds me, did you get that 18,000 you won last night? No, but he promised me a check before I leave. Uncle Dick, Mr. Vance is here. - Do you have a gun? - No. Sit down. - Surprised? - No, not particularly. It's all in this letter to Markham. Keep your hands down. I'll take that. I'm going to burn this before I drill you. Without seeing how near I came to guessing right? It's very short really, read it. You read it. I'll let you live until you've finished. I wish it were longer. For the sake of brevity, I put it in synopsis form. "Lynn Llewellyn, a rich weakling, is utterly selfish, without moral restraint, and suffers from egomania." - Hm? - Egomania. "Frequently a symptom of incipient paranoia." Oh, skip it. "Tired of his wife, he plans a perfect crime to poison her... ...and throw the blame on his uncle, whom he hates. He substitutes a saturate solution of mandragorin for his wife's eyewash... ...and prepares smaller doses for his mother and himself." You knew the same poison taken by mouth wouldn't be fatal. You figured on its knocking you both out just enough to free you from suspicion. Am I right? You're dead right. "For the same purpose he put up signposts, all pointing to his uncle's direction. First he chose the night before his mother made a new will disinheriting her brother. Second, he put tablets containing a very small quantity of mandragorin... ...on top of the nitrites in the bottle and swallowed them at the casino. And third, he played on water." - You caught that, eh? - Yes. You sold the whole affair with fake water clues. "He mailed his first letter from Closter, where his uncle has his laboratory, hoping that when no poison was found in his wife's stomach, they might suspect heavy water. He trapped his uncle into bringing him water from his own caraffe. Gave the mandragorin to his mother in her water bottle..." - But she never got it. - No. Doris got it by mistake. Oh, Doris. Yes... She's a bit late. Due at 8:15. Is that in your letter? - No. - No, I thought not. This is going to be the perfect crime after all. The only two people who know too much are you and Doris. I sent her a note in your name with a key to this place. And when the two of you are found here dead, your butler will testify that my uncle phoned you from Closter... ...and made a date to meet you here. And even if Uncle has an alibi, they'll think he had a gunman to do the dirty work. Now, burn that letter. Mr. Vance, are you there? Doris, don't... Keep still. This is the craziest idea I ever heard of meeting you here... What's the matter? Smudge on my nose? Lynn... You? Oh! - Against the wall, both of you. Before I bump you off, mind telling me when you first began to suspect? From the moment your mother killed herself. Her confession was obviously intended to shield someone else. You were the only one she cared about. - Heaven knows why. - Why, he's mad. Can't you see, he's completely mad! Step aside, I'm going to shoot him first. Vance! Darling, darling, you can't die, I won't let you. Well, that's all I wanted to know. - Thanks, Heath. - Yeah, but what's the idea? Easier on the family. And then I knew you wouldn't shoot unless you'd thought he'd polished me off. - And you're not even hurt? - No. Oh, I could kill you myself. - Did you get that confession? - Certainly I did, you know me. So did I, every word. Why, Becky. That's for putting the blanks in Lynn's gun. Fifty dollars! Why, that's the biggest surprise I've had in my life! Come on, I'll show you another one. Ha...
