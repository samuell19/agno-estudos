Marie for Memory Who are you? Hieronymus Bosch, clairvoyant I represent antics of the formless and bleeding world. And who are you? I belong to the one and only movement that tries to explain the place of the human being in the contemporary world. And who are you? Jacques Lacan, an orthodox psychoanalyst who builds his theory on the basis of Freud's ideas. And who are you? I work. Cinema as a perfect mean of communication. and the way to prove you exist It has deserved salvation And who are you? I am an immoralist, all ideologies are alien for me. I don't need any tricks. I am bored. Marie, can't you see, I'm bored. Do you have cards? This is really beautiful. I saw you with him. This is Gabriel. No, no! You don't know him. It's impossible. We don't understand each other.??? She just tries you out. I beg you, let's not continue. We'll have to suffer a lot. I'm 20 years old. I live with my parents. I am waiting for my coming of age. I am 20 years old. I live with my mother who has been taking care of me since my father committed suicide on the day I was born. I do social and economic research, Division of Criticism, Department of Immorality and Comparative Bickering. I am in my 7th year at the Department of Philosophy. I wanted to commit suicide a couple of times. You shouldn't hasten your absence in this world, it's a ridiculous collective crime that you add to your own crimes. Nevertheless it all encourages it. All the excuses are not valid anymore. And isn't the despair itself feigned? The only menace is the boredom. In this case I prefer to be killed immediately. Marie, please, stay, I implore you. Marie, please, stay, I implore you. Marie, please, stay, I implore you. I have to break away from this. I am sure that rational reasoning isn't inherent to women. Why this at all? To satisfy my needs? This will not help. Wait, I have an idea. Why are you silent? What's wrong with you? Are you sad? Say something! Are you bored? I am bored. Talk! This comedy has lasted long enough. I am confused. But my mind is clear again. This heat is unbearable. Cold and film. A woman is a woman and I can't change anything. I can't calm you down in any other way. From now on I'll treat your words as accusations. Why should I make love to you? If these accusations turn out to be true in the nexy 7 years, I will be able to free myself quickly. You are the only one who knows about my illness. So it is only you who can hurt me with your reproaches. It is necessary that the dialog that is bringing us closer, doesn't stop. Starting tomorrow we'll part to take a dive into work. So how can we preserve the integrity of the dialog? How will you be able to talk to me, if you are not next to me? It is necessary for every word, every movement to engender excitement in me, as if it were you who is talking or moving, so that the signs of your presence were everywhere. It is necessary to find the explanation of my mental illness. You can go, I'm bored with you. Talk. Talk. I saw them together often. This nice girl is confused. Marie. Marie could try to save herself. Yes, I am sure, but Communicate, pronounce words. I don't think so. Maybe. These are just fantasies. Yes, just fantasies. Yes, it's a question of tact. When a girl is obsessed with you you have to deal with it with tact. And so you begin to believe in mysticism, to believe that it is possible to gain, to believe that it is possible to attain, to believe that it happens due to the external forces. I think this will lead to almost complete ignorance. And then the search for the other person starts. This is the goal of life. But is not like that. You spin and spin in all directions. One has to reconcile with it One has to come to terms with this illusion, whose essence is that one has to fall in love all the time, to be able to respond to the one who turns to you. We have to break up. I've stopped being objective, you command my unconsciousness. There is nothing I can hide from you I am the only one to be fooled, because I believed in the most flattering image of myself I could have conjured up. You depend on me and every single one of your phrases copies mine. I'd like our consciousnesses to be symmetrical. Wake up! It's time! I'm afraid. I know. I hate it. I go to cover and feed you. All my other activities are turned away from their initial goal At least when I look for the food and cover for you I treat the others from the point of view of the survival of the fittest. How can I support those who are ready to succumb to my despotic will? Wear this, it's cold outside. - Good luck! - Bye, Mom! "Maidens of Golgotha" This is amazing! Amazing! In short, we are thinking together that this is amazing. And so we begin to understand each other a little bit. We can't understand everything at once, but we'll understand the necessary things. That is, just a part of it. A small part. Nevertheless I realize that it is necessary to come to it as close as possible. So one comes closer and closer. But once we get there we have not been able to advance So we tell ourselves: maybe we have to step back and as a result, one way or another we make 1 step forward and 2 steps back we won't achieve anything in this manner and yet we have to understand it. Maybe I'm just sleeping. in the end, it's possible that I'm just sleeping It is like like that philosopher, Chinese philosopher who dreams that he is a butterfly and after he wakes up, he asks himself if he's not perhaps a butterfly that dreams to be a Chinese philosopher. I just wanted to say, it is important to start to learn how to understand now, but when I say 'now' the moment I say 'now' is not a present moment anymore, it is a past one. What we need is ahead of us, and I will reach it. The only thing I have to say is that we haven't reached it yet. And sometimes really good ideas come into my head. I think about it and one can say that etymologically I understand, but this is too quick. It is right in front of you. All of it passes by. I think we've arrived. This makes 5 francs, including heating. Here you go, 5 francs. Tell me. No, no. I've charged one stupid guy. Yes, yes, that's why I laughed. No, no, I'm all good, thanks. I am perfectly fine. It's picking my eyes! Hello! I'd like to tell you a good news over the phone About the crimes happening in France especially in Versailles and Saint-Denis. I was shocked by one thing: before the guilty one is found, the people's anger becomes stronger, and from every side to begin with the press and radio there aren't expressions strong enough to describe the indignation Then the search came to an end, thanks to the police. and the criminals are found. Starting from this precise moment the tone changes... Explanations that diminish the guilt of the prosecuted appear. For instance, that he was sick or was a victim of difficult family situation, society's influence, that he rebelled. When he was young he was troubled Of course, one has to be merciful, but I ask myself, where will it lead us this kind of deculpabilision of society and individual? This does not help to protect security of the regular citizens. And for the believers the rising number of the crimes committed becomes a sign that the world has entered the final and decisive stage of its history and we are awaiting Christ, because we don't expect from the state officials police, economists, moralists or scientists to facilitate the establishment of peace, love and absolute equality of all the people. We expect it from Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who will be shortly among us again. This was a good news over the phone. Do you have the New Testament? Hello, is this SOS-friendship? Please, send someone over to me as soon as possible. You've called us. What is bothering you? You don't want to talk? I am know how you feel, you want to smash your head against the wall. You have to say at least something to start talking. You don't want to talk. I'm worried about you. Don't move. I took measures to detox. I won't be doing anything. I don't want you helping me. Are you still here? I'd like to stay. I am busy. - And? - What 'and'? Talk. He is successful with his intrigues. What are we to do then? Well, at least tell me about yourself. You're jealous. Yes, I'm jealous. Well, tell me about him at least. Jesus is possessed. When he left me, I lost everything. Malicious, depressed. - It was right, what you did. - I am not sure now. I didn't want to take pills. I don't understand you. You don't understand me anymore. Andrien doesn't understand me anymore either. No one listens to me. No one understands me. Yes. No, don't tell the things I haven't said. Well, no. Wait a second. You've forgotten to shave yourself. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Just a second! No, no, no, I'll be with you in a second. We've read your report. It is good, very good. We like your violence a lot. Your opinions are extreme. It is possible to say that you express extreme opinions on the extreme issues and this is extremely interesting for us. Do you follow? Hello! Hello! Please, don't hang up! Don't hang up! I'll be right back! Yes, exactly! But be careful, very careful! You have to be a little bit cruel, but only theoretically, not to darken your research. Do you understand? This is a socio-economic organization, not a... Well, you understand what I mean. Hello! Yes, yes, yes! Very calm. A lot calmer than usually I don't know, I don't know. Yes, yes, I'll tell you as soon as I find out. Please, don't hang up, I'll be with you in a second. And one more thing: I have an impression that you are not aware that you are full of contradictions, for instance, between the essence and the form, the means and the structure, the development of the idea. Do you understand? But dialectics will forgive you this mistake of the young age. Hello! Still nothing. Yes, he is standing with his arms crossed. Yes, I'll keep this in mind. I'll be with you in a moment. You are basing this on the concrete data, which is very good, but don't be stuck in the statistics. Numbers. Numbers can express almost everything one would wish to express. But please don't forget about the human factor. Human... I'll dare a quote: "Absorb all the human" Spencer, the philosopher, has said this, you've probably heard about him. Human Because, well, you understand not only the observer or the observed object are important, but also the distance between the observer and the observed object. The right distances are the basis of the good relations and good report. You understand me for sure. In short, you should think in a more abstract way despite the concrete data, and make concrete conclusions based on the blurry data. Hello. I'll call you back in a moment. Yes. I'll call you back. I am giving you a new case. Here it is. Yes, yes, he's gone. It's me who decides here. The others speak on my behalf. I am worried about my reputation. It is difficult to go away and to return. And now I will... Careful! You annoy me. I have never talked about the family. Why don't you want us to leave? You don't even want to look at me. Yes, I know. I want everything to be clean. I don't have time. This girl brings me a lot of troubles. I have a lot of things to do and I don't have time. It's my fault, I know. this girl, she's very complicated. Do I really love my daughter? Do I really love my daughter? Sebastian. I know this. It is very difficult to bring up this girl. I have a lot of things to do. This is too much. Get out! Get out! The life isn't a spectacle. Damn! -You won't even help me now? Tell if I'm wrong That which inspires me is my vision which preceeds reason. I've came to Earth again to tell you: from now on, already, time and space no longer please me My soul is an open sky The human being has created the God to his own likeness man's repressive conduct worsens his state of regression To break free, regain our memory! Depend extensively on all these metaphors! It brings nothing apart from the excessive anxiety. And the last thing: the state full of affectation, feeling responsible for the order of my life, this state is called madness. Nevertheless, at any moment the research may stop serving the purpose to turn into a deception in it's own turn. In front of this phenomenon of revelation Jesus was sometimes telling prophetic things. And his atheism hangs on by a hair, but this hair is very strong. Because only the rapture of the revelation may allow a human being to loose control of oneself. The risk of culture. The communication turns into ideology and ideology is a feeling of security that makes us blind. It is also illogical to think that someone, who knows really feels a genuine need to share this knowledge. It is the same as talking to an animal, who can talk only in a metaphorical sense. But let's go back to our fantasy. For those who decided to put off things that can be done today for tomorrow this is the end of the news. Why are you so beautiful today? Is this day an important one for you? Look, what Jesus gave me as a present. I have something for you. Drink more. More. That's enough. Aren't you afraid? You'll be in a lot of pain soon. The pain will come in waves, each time stronger and stronger. You have to surrender to them, help them, work together with them. This work will be very hard, the one that starts. It'll be against you and with you. You'll have a baby, but it'll cease to be a part of you. It'll leave you. It'll distance itself from you and it won't be with you anymore. I won't be by you. I'll sort the guy who invented a tie! Careful, careful. Careful. Careful. Careful. And now this eternal comedy will start again, I'm sick of it. Such a presentation, that's not alright! Well, there's no alright alright... It's part of the job You know me. You look ridiculous. Don't pour gasoline on the fire because I've had enough I ask ya not to smoke So what? No, you always have it your way I don't care. I'll be on dole pretty soon. You'll see how much money I'll get for the boy. I'm not joking. I don't care. Damn, this is shit. You can't even drive. Learn how to drive. Get out! Shut up! Get out! He's very handsome. I'll call him... I'll call him... I'll call him Jesus. Hurry up! I feel sick. I feel sick. Hurry up! I don't know, I don't know. Help! I feel sick! Help! Help! I feel sick! Now there are two of you. You are filled, closed. You have to open up. I feel sick. My baby, My baby! My baby, my baby!.. Leave me alone! My baby! No, leave me alone! There. My baby Be quiet. I can't watch, how people suffer. I want my baby. Tell me please, how did your pregnancy start? I want my baby. When did you understand that you were pregnant? What about your belly? Was it big? We don't know, we don't know. I want my baby Probably, you were thinking, you believed... I want my baby. Sure. Then in subway you've been offered a seat because... No, the last time I... But it all turned out ok. I tell this every year. Quiet, like this. Good. She reminds me of her We'll give you a good dressing down. I want a baby because Because I love my children and because if you love someone, you want to have his child But I have always wanted to have a child anyway. But it was always related to many problems. It is very difficult to have a baby and someone who would love you. I think I was the same, but I don't remember exactly. But it had happened, that's why I understand you. Solitude is an eternal state. It relates to everyone to a bigger or lesser extent. No one feels solitary. I don't know. I don't understand anything And I don't see any I don't know what to do with myself. No. No, I fell in love not a long time ago. I don't remember how it all started. It starts when you meet someone. And you either fall in love or you don't fall in love. Something either happens or doesn't happen. It is possible to meet the same person but under different circumstances and nothing will happen. I don't know. It all has started like this in my case. But I have no idea how it will end. I can't understand what have I done wrong. It is always one and the same. No, I don't think so. I don't think so. To have a life, to have a baby... Am I afraid to lose someone I love I believe, in any case it is very probable that one day I will loose him. Yes, it is like that. I don't know. I've forgotten everything, I don't know anything anymore. Please, sit down. I have to tell you, I saw Marie. She told us about her fears that are connected with you. Sure, sure. Please, do not treat everything so tragically. It is not so important. Of course, reality has ceased to exist for you. But believe me, there's a teaching it is based on the experience. Besides, you can tell yourself that this has happened to you and no one else. Every cloud has a silver lining, as they say. Please, make a report about this. It is for your own good. Do that! We believe in you. I'll go and shave myself. Some girl has come to see you. Talk to me, Marie. Talk to me. Your name is Blondine? I've heard about you. Marie, please, recall! Talk to me! Marie!
