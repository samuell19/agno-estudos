Why put Jessica Ann through this? - This is Jessie's mother we're talking about. And your sister. - She tried to kill that little girl. - I know, I know, she's a sick woman. Still, if I had my way they wouldn't be doing this. - It's what they do to rabid dogs. - Beth, your sister dies this afternoon. She wants to say "Goodbye" to her daughter and you. Are you going to deny her that? Beth, look at me. The woman I married wasn't cruel. In fact, the woman I married is a sucker for sad movies. Now, think about where we are. - You're right, you're always right. - Ooh, think about where we are. - Here we have some cookies on the table for you downstairs. (pensive music) Hey, slow down all of you, be careful. - If you wanna stay. - Well, no, I'm not hungry. I don't have to watch them kill her do I? - No, of course not. - Good. I'm not up for that. - Well, it won't hurt honey. They just give her a shot. - Nothing is worse than a shot. (alarm buzzing) (door slamming) - I appreciate your efforts on my client's behave Dr. Price. (door buzzing) With this new antipsychotic drug, Mrs. Sterling could lead a normal productive life. - Look, we're dealing with a reactionary, lame duck governor. He doesn't want to be remembered as a guy who reprieved a killer mommy. - A month from now we could be dealing with a whole new administration. Ekhardt, if we could just buy some time. - Time for her runs out in about one hour. (door buzzing) Got to hand it to her, not a crack in that mask of hers even now. - Don't kid yourself. You know her sister hasn't let her see that little girl in months. Her daughter means everything to Mrs. Sterling. - Why blame her sister? That child's mother saw her kill a man right in front of her. - Oh oh, is this the way you tried to turn the governor around? - Don't kid yourself. Without Jessica Ann's testimony, mommy would've walked. They didn't even charge her for the other murders. - Hmm. (pensive music) Do you think she killed them? Two husbands. A teacher the, the one who denied her daughter the outstanding award, and a, and a janitor. - Don't ask me to betray my client, and I won't ask you to betray yours. - Ekhardt, if she's the monster everybody says she is, then why do we both care about what happens to her. - Because she's the damnedest case either one of us ever had. - Well, looks like the governor didn't name Mrs. Sterling "Mother of the Year." - Nobody likes a sore winner, March. You really relish seeing a woman die? - Yes. This one I do. - She, she in the chamber. - No no no, she's in visitation. Saying "Goodbye" to her daughter. Very touching scene, right Lieutenant? Between a mother and a child she tried to strangle. - Oh, stop by my office, Anderson. You two, March. I'll get both you guys in group therapy. There's no charge. (tense music) - I know there's nothing I can say to make it up to either of you, but I've had a lot of time to think, and when I look back on my life I see two people that mean a lot to me. (sighing) Beth, you were always there. Thank-you. (sighing) Jessica Ann, I, I know you think I was gonna hurt you. - You didn't hurt me, much. - When I saw your face in the moonlight, I couldn't hurt you, I could never hurt you. You're a part of me. - I know mommy. - And I'm a part of you. And I still will be, even if I'm gone. - I know mommy, I know. - It's time, I'm sorry. - Who's your best friend? - You are mommy. - Who loves you more than anything on god's green earth? - You mommy. - That's right, that's right. Don't ever forget it. - I won't mommy. - Let's go. - Paul. - Yes? - I er, I know I haven't been very warm to you. - Oh, why should you be. I make a small fortune writing your story, then steal your sister from you. - This was your doing today, wasn't it? Talking Beth into letting me say, "Goodbye." - Yes. - Thank-you for that. - Oh hell, it'll make a great scene if I write the sequel. - Looks like a short sequel. (chattering) - Come on. (typewriter clattering) - What did she say to you? - Goodbye. - Are they gonna kill her in there? - Oh no honey. They take her to another room called the er, the lethal injection chamber. Different states do it different ways. Do you know what a drip is? - Yeah, him. - Right, you have a point. Anyway, in er, in some states they put an IV in the person's arm and then in the hanging plastic bag they put er... - Poison? Well, what do they do in this state? - Well, it's like you said, er, they give her a shot, and you're right, I'm sure it hurts like all shots hurt, and then she goes to sleep. - And never wakes up. - Yes. (sad music) - I know she did bad things. Oh I know she did bad things, but I don't want her to die. - I know you don't honey. - I prayed and prayed they wouldn't kill her. I prayed and prayed. Do you think god heard? - I'm sure he heard. - But did he listen? (trolley rattling) - Neal. - Anything I can do for you? - The envelope. - Yeah. - I gave you. - Hmm. - It's a list of safe deposit boxes. Put everything into a trust fund for Jessica Ann. - Done. (sighing) - Well, in this state you have the right to have your personal physician present. You want me to-- - Ah, no, no John. I don't want you to see this. Thank-you for what you attempted to do, both of you. (somber music) (heart beating) (door clicking) - I understand you declined the chaplain. - I'm at peace with myself. - It's more than I can say. - I'm a baptist, but thanks. - The warden has to read something, officially. - Mrs. Sterling. (coughing) "In the name of the people, and the governor of this state, "we carry out sentence on this day "of May 17th for the capital crime of murder." May god have mercy on your soul. - And yours. (door clattering) (ominous music) (bag creaking) (plastic gloves snapping) (tense music) (bottles clattering) if you don't mind my saying so, you seem a little bit nervous. - This will be over quickly. Don't make it any harder on yourself than it has to be. - This is your first time. - Please. - Mine too. Afraid of infection? - Please, I prefer we not talk. (liquid squelching) (tense music) - Don't, doctor, erm, I moment please, please. I erm, I need to pray. (choir music) I have to pray. - All right. - Just, unstrap my hands so I can fold my hands. And bow my head and pray properly. - I can't, that's, it's impossible. - Oh please, please doctor, I, I have to pray. I really, I need to pray. Don't send me into darkness without the word of god to guide me. - I just can't. - Oh please. (crying) Doctor, tonight when you try and go to sleep, remember me, doctor. Remember the woman you murdered, whose pitiful last request, you refuse. (door buzzing) (dramatic music) I'm going to need a chauffeur. Any volunteers. - You're not walking out of here, you stop right now. - The boys at med school are going to have a familiar cadaver. - Don't do this. - Neal, I think from here on out I'll handle my own defense. Dr. Price, are you up for driving? - I I-- - Mrs. Sterling. Mrs. Sterling. (gun firing) - Ow, ah. - Don't just stand there, she need immediate attention. - What's wrong, you okay. (prison alarm wailing) - Now, na, never better. What, looks like your client bought herself a reprieve after all, Mr. Ekhardt. - You know the law lieutenant. - Yeah, can't execute a prisoner until and unless they're perfectly healthy. It wouldn't be civilized. (Mrs. Sterling sighing) (birds twittering) (tannoy sounding) (voice inaudible) - [Doctor] This is just a local to make the insertion of the implant itself painless. - Will there be a scar, doctor? - Hmm, a tiny one, and a bit of a bump on your forearm where the flexible silicone rod is tucked under the skin. Now you understand, your medication will be released continuously in a small, measured douse. It's kind of like a time-release cold capsule. - Will I still be me? - Hmm, you're still you. - New and improved, like a laundry detergent. - You're violent behavior has a biochemical basis. The anti-psychotic drug short-circuits your aggressive impulses. - Oh, I've always liked designer clothing. Now, I'll have a designer brain. My wardrobe will be complete. - You had a choice, lethal injection or that implant in your arm. And you're still very much a trial case, a a social experiment. - A guineapig. - A live one. Look, if this doesn't work, or if you get cute and remove that implant, your next shot will be back at state prison, or from that police sergeant's gun. - Is it my fault his friend, Lieutenant March had a stroke? - After the stress of your attempted jailbreaks, Sergeant Anderson certainly thinks so yes. - John, don't think I'm ungrateful. (pensive music) I know what you've done for me. You saved my life. - Now, do you have any questions about how the implant's going to work? - Well, I'm gonna have a better sense of right and wrong. Hmm, you know, no man's ever thought I needed implants before. - I can believe that. But you will have more normal emotional responses. - Like you? - Yes. Now you have the address of that halfway house. - Hmm. What about my daughter? How often can I see my daughter? - You er, you can't. - What? - I was hoping with the implant would have more time to mellow you out. - What do you mean, I can't see my daughter? She's my daughter. - Your sister got a court order. It's a restraining order. You're not to see Jessica Ann. (chair squeaking) Look I'm sorry darling. Maybe in time we can turn this around. I don't know, talk to your attorney. Are you all right. - I, (sighing) I think so. - Are you crying? (upbeat music) (audience clapping) - Paula Sands live, where your opinions count. And here's the first lady of daytime talk, Paula Sands. (audience applauding) - Thank-you Brad, studio audience. Today on the show we have a serious, even troubling topic. I'm sure you all remember the so-called killer mommy case that captured so much attention not long ago. Well yesterday, the woman convicted of murdering her lover when she discovered he was an insurance investigator looking into the mysterious death of her husband, the woman who murdered her lover in front of her 11 year old daughter, a woman who police claim, though it was never proven, tried to murder her own little girl to silence her as a witness. That woman, that mother was released yesterday. And we have with us today, as our guest, Jolene Jones, the sister of one of Mrs. Sterling's alleged victims, a janitor at McKinley School who died of electrocution. Along with Ms. Jones, Paul Conway is also here. He is the author of numerous successful true crime books including "Conversations with Killers, "True Stories of Murder for Hire." And of course, his bestseller, this one right here, 16 weeks on the bestseller list, "The Mommy Murders." Mr. Conway, it's nice to have you here today. - Thank-you, it's my pleasure. - You are here not so much as an expert on this case today, but as a representative of Mrs. Sterling's family, you are indeed married to the sister of this convicted killer. - Yes, that's correct. I met the entire family while I was doing research on this case, and erm, my book erm, which just came out in paperback by the way. It tries to deal compassionately with this tragedy. - (laughing) I'll tell you about tragedy, you (beeping) What's tragic is my sister getting her (beeping) fried. - Thank god for seven second delay. - Thank the FCC. This is great television. - Excuse me Mrs. Sterling was never charged for that offense. - Oh, but your book indicates her probable guilt. - Probably my (beeping) that psycho bitch is walking the streets and my sister is six feet (beeping) under. - Now wait a second, wait a second, if your sister was indeed murdered, and not killed in an unfortunate accident, as the coroner ruled, well then she was a blackmailer who was-- - Oh wait a second. What, what are you saying, that she got what was coming to her? Lousy piece of New York (beeping) You're making piles of money off my poor dead sister. You're getting rich off other people's tragedies. (television clicking) - I told you we weren't going to watch that. - Maybe you're not interested but I wanted to see Paul. - He didn't want you watching either did he? You heard him say things might get out of hand. - That's why I wanted to watch it. - I won't have you talking to me in that tone. - You're not my mother. - No but I never tried to kill you either. (Jessica Ann sighing) I'm sorry. - It's okay, but I'm not a little kid. I have a right to know what people are saying about me and mommy. - And there's something else you have a right to know. It's what the court thinks about you and your mommy. - What do you mean? - The court has decided that you and your mother shouldn't have any contact for awhile, at least not until they're sure she's better. - I can't even see my own mother? - Do you want to? - I don't know. - That's a healthy attitude, Jessie. - Huh, it should be up to me not some judge. - I'm your guardian now, Jessie, your legal parent, and frankly it's up to me. - If I wanted to see mommy or talk to her, you'd stop me? - When you're 18 you can decide for yourself if you want a relationship with the woman who killed your father and stepfather. As long as you're my responsibility, I can't allow you near her. - Great, two psycho moms. (jingling music) (birds twittering) (people chattering) (Mrs. Sterling sighing) - Getting settled? - (gasping) Yes. - Who checked you in, Mary? - Why yes. - I look familiar to you, don't I? - Actually you do. I'm sorry, it's this medication, I'm not quite myself. - I'm Mrs. Evans, I used to be your daughter's principal over at McKinley. - Oh. - A lovely child. - Of course, Mrs. Evans, how silly of me. - I retired at the end of last school year and now I'm helping out here at the halfway house. - Good for you. - Yes isn't it. I wanted to welcome you and to let you know that I'll be watching you. - Watching? - Mrs. Withers, the teacher, she was a wonderful woman, and one of my best friends. - Okay, that was an accident. - I know dear, you're innocent, like OJ. (ominous music) I just wanted you to know that it would give me the greatest satisfaction to see you back on death row where you belong. Good afternoon. (lively music) ♪ Look so pretty in your lace and dress ♪ - I think you're dead wrong about this Beth. - I won't have Jessie anywhere near that woman. - Personally I think it would be good for both of them. They both have a lot of healing to do. - You're not the one who walked away from that little girl and left her in the care of a sociopath. - Well honey, there was nothing you could do. You had no legal right to intervene. - I had a moral responsibility. I knew my sister was potentially dangerous, and yet I left that child in harm's way because I was too afraid to stand up to her. Well, I'm not afraid now. - I don't wanna argue about this. I'm just expressing an opinion. You know, I'm Jessica Ann's legal guardian too. - I know, I'm sorry. - [Paul] I tell you for a beginner she's really very good. She's got a lot of poise. - [Beth] I don't know if this is so good for her. - [Paul] Why, are you crazy? - Every day she comes here to practice. She's obsessed. - Hmm, some obsessions can be healthy. I, for example, am obsessed with you. (chattering) - Oops. - Are you about ready to go? - Can't I stay awhile? Lessons don't start 'til six. - Sure, we'll pick you up then. - Aren't you going to watch me some more? - Too cold for us non-Eskimos. We'll see you at six honey. (chattering) (ominous music) (suspenseful music) - [John] You didn't talk to her? - I just watched from afar. - Well, I can't encourage you to talk to her. Much as I, I personally think that's a healthy thing, but to do so would be jeopardizing your outpatient status. - You mean, they'll throw me back on death row. - Yes. There are a lot of people out there who want to see you fail. - Really? I hadn't noticed. - You want me to have you transferred to another halfway house? - Does a change of venue really matter in a case this notorious? No thank-you. - You know, I would do anything within my power to do for you. - Well then, help me get my daughter back. - Oh custody is out of the question. - No no, not custody, I just wanna see her. And I wanna talk to her. I want Jessica Ann not to hate me and I know Beth is saying terrible, hurtful things. - Now look, just keep that pretty little nose clean, and how knows in six months, or a year. - Please. - Something wrong? - I, I I just don't er, (sighing) I just don't feel that way about you anymore doctor. Is that going to be a problem? - No. Not at all. (frogs chirping) (door knocking) - Got a sec, pal? - Er, sure, come on in. (light music) I saw you on TV today, until Beth shut it off. - Oh, I heard. She's a little er, uptight. - You think. - Do me a favor, cut her some slack will you. - Huh, she told me I can't see mommy or to talk to her or anything ever. - Ever? - Tsk, well same as, 'til I'm 18. - I think you're right wanting to understand and forgive your mommy. - Really? Well, why can't we just invite her over sometime, and just see how she's doing? - You miss her. - Well, she is my mother. - Hmm, someday I'll get you two back together, I promise. But until then you have to do me a favor. - What Paul? - Well, you have to put up with your Aunt Beth's commandment about seeing your mother. You do that for now and I'll work on later, okay? - Okay. - Aunt Beth knows that you love her, but she needs more from you Jessica. She needs your respect. - Why? - Because she hasn't really learned to respect herself yet. Okay, we got a deal. Goodnight pal. (rink noise crackling) - Goodnight. (chattering) (ominous music) - You look so beautiful out there, so graceful. - I asked you once if I could take lessons, but you said it was too dangerous. - I know, your mother's made some mistakes dear. - Huh, we're not supposed to talk. - Do you think that should be anyone's decision but ours? - No, but I don't want to get either one of us in trouble. - (sighing) How are you doing in school? - Okay I guess. - What about your last report card? Any Bs? - No, just As. - Did they give an outstanding student award? - No, they stopped doing that. I have to go. I have a private lesson. - I'm proud of you. - Excuse me, you're Mrs. Sterling aren't you, Jessica Ann's mother? - Er, yes. - Do me a favor, Jessica Ann, go practice our axels for awhile. - Practice hard dear. - [Instructor] Parental interest is something I encourage. - Well, I'm glad to hear that. - Normally, but I know all about you Mrs. Sterling. I know about the restraining order. - I, I just wanted to watch my little girl skate. - Jessica Ann is in training, Mrs. Sterling, for her first competition. She doesn't need this kind of pressure. - I wasn't hurting anything. - I don't want to see you in here again. If I do, I'll report you, understood? - She's my daughter, daughter, daughter, daughter, daughter. (pensive music) (horn honking) (traffic rumbling) (skates rumbling) (ominous music) - How long are you gonna work out in here tonight anyway? - About an hour or so. - Turn the lights out yourself then. (dramatic music) (ice crinkling) - What the hell are you doing here? Get off the ice. (dramatic music) (blade smashing) - (sighing) Oh you had nothing to do with this. - Why would I harm a person I barely knew? - (sighing) When it comes to shopping for murder, you're something of an impulse buyer. - I hope this doesn't impede Jessica Ann's progress with her skating. She has a competition coming up, you know. - You were seen talking with her. - I was there in the afternoon, just watching. - I have witness statements Mrs. Sterling. - I merely told Jessica Ann that we shouldn't talk, that the court didn't want us to have contact. - But you did have contact! - There was an inch of plexiglass separating us Sergeant. - It's gonna have to be reported to the court. - Don't you report all murders to the court? - I am talking about seeing your daughter. - Sergeant, a man is dead. And you're concerned about keeping a mother from her daughter. Where are your values? - And where were you at the time of the murder? Let's cut the chitchat here lady. - Haven't you heard? I have an implant that makes me behave. - You got an implant? I tell you what I think. I think you implanted that hockey skate into that instructor's back 37 times, that's what I think. And I think that you could use a better placed 38 caliber implant. That is what I think. - How is Lieutenant March? - He's paralyzed, he's a damned vegetable. He's keeping company with the drool cup. - Pity, such a lovely man. Close the door on your way out will you sergeant. I treasure what little privacy I have in this place. (people chattering) - Sure. - Jessie, I have some very troubling news. - What is it? - Your skating instructor, last night-- (tense music) - What? - Sergeant Anderson was here and he wanted to talk to you, but I put him off. - What? Why, I'm not a baby. - I know, but you've been through so much. - Is mommy all right? - Oh, she's all right, all right physically. - Did something happen to my skating instructor? - Yes. - An accident? - Not an accident, murder. - Oh no. - Ah, Jessie, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. - What happened? - It's too horrible. - What happened? - Multiple stab wounds with, with a skate. - You think mommy did this? - You spoke to her yesterday didn't you, at the rink. - Yeah, she was there watching. I wasn't gonna pretend she didn't exist. - [Beth] Your mother had words with your skating instructor. - Not really. He just told mommy not to come around, 'cause of the court order. - Jessie, there are witnesses. - To the murder? - No, to you two talking. Your mother screaming at you. - She didn't do this. - How can you be so certain? - I just am. - She's probably going to be back in prison very soon. But in the meantime, under no circumstances are you to have any contact with her. - But Aunt Beth! - If she walks up to you, walk away, do you understand? Walk away. - Woo woo woo, detective, it's a physiological impossibility that Mrs. Sterling committed that murder with that antipsychotic implant in her arm. - How do you know it is in her arm? - Because I saw her this morning. Look, this is a rod underneath the flesh. It's surgically implanted and replaced on a yearly basis. It doesn't come with a zipper. - Oh, that's cute. Why are you standing up for this woman? - Ah. - Huh? Ever stopped to consider that er, maybe this isn't a matter of science or medicine? Maybe little mommy here doesn't have a chemical deficiency in her brain but she has got a blackness in her heart. - Are you looking for a vampire to drive a stake through? This is a woman with an illness. - Yeah yeah, and I've got the cure. - Well, you'd make a fine frontier marshal there Max, just not a very good detective. - Nah, what are you talking about? - The viciousness of this crime doesn't begin to match Mrs. Sterling's psychological profile. - Look, John she commits two kinds of murders. Her calculated black widow style sendoffs of her wealthy husbands, and her spur of the moment murders of people standing between her and what she wants. - And a skating instructor stood between her and her precious daughter? - Bingo. - You're forgetting one thing detective, Mrs. Sterling is not sadistic. She takes no pleasure in killing. She simply removes obstacles as cleanly as possible. And you blame her for your partner's misfortune. - You bet your ass, you stop right there. He had a stroke. - And did Mrs. Sterling force-feed him four packs of cigarettes a day for 40 years? Or are you just a little bit more interested in putting mommy away than you are in finding out who's really responsible for this killing? - You think? (school belling ringing) (chattering) (doors banging) - Are you okay? - Sure. - Are you ready for the history test? - I guess. - You shouldn't listen to what kids say. - Who says I listen? - Nobody, I just thought at lunch you might have heard this kid-- - What? - Just don't pay any attention to them, that's all. - (sighing) Whatever. - Jessica Ann, I, I'm sorry I didn't meant to scare you, honey. - You're not supposed to be here. - I had to see you. - I'm not supposed to see you. You're gonna go back to jail. - That's why we have to talk. You know, your skating instructor, that terrible accident. - It wasn't an accident. You don't accidentally get stabbed a hundred times. - I didn't do. I didn't do it, you have to believe me. - I do. - You do? Do you really? - You'd have stabbed him once, and maybe choked him. - Oh my god. You hate me, don't you? - No, I don't hate you. - Jessica Ann, who's your next class? - Er, first floor west wing. - Then you better move along. You're Mrs. Sterling aren't you? You're not supposed to be seeing your daughter. - I wouldn't do that if I were you. - So, that's your old lady, huh? What'd they do, let her out of the nuthouse for the afternoon. (kids laughing) Must be pretty cool having a serial mom. - Yeah, maybe it runs in the family. Maybe I'll kill you, in your sleep. - Jessica Ann. Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I just, I want to talk to you for a second. Ha ha, I tell you, you really got in that kid's fact. That was good. They sport you today, huh? Hey, do you want a piece of gum? - No, my mother didn't get my teeth straightened so I could ruin them. - No no, don't chew gum, no not with braces and stuff. (laughing) Hey listen, do you remember me? - You work with Lieutenant March. - Yeah well, I did 'til he got sick. Your mom had a hand in that one. - I'm sorry he's sick but my mother had nothing to do with it. Excuse me I have to-- - no, no wait a minute, wait up, now wait a minute, I just want to talk to you, just want to talk to you for a couple of seconds. A couple of questions here. Number one have you talked to your mother lately? - You mean you didn't see us just now? Aren't you following us around hiding behind the bushes and stuff? - (laughing) Well, as a matter of fact I am. Talked to her yesterday too didn't you? - You know I did, at the skating rink. Mommy and my instructor got in a little tiff, but nothing mommy would kill over. - You sure about that, Jessica Ann? - Well, I'm sure of one thing. - You are, what's that? - They ought to stick one of those things in your arm, you're the nut. (feet thumping) (Anderson laughing) - Smart kid, smart kid. (school bell ringing) - Thank-you for giving me this opportunity to tell my side. - Well, we think you've gotten a raw deal in the media, and we're here to balance that out. - And er, I won't have to answer any questions from er, from them. - No no, this is just a simple one-on-one interview with Paula. She's on your side, we're all on your side. - And er, no surprises. - The only surprise is how it's gonna feel to be vindicated. Let's go, have a seat. - Mrs. Sterling. - Hello. - Hello, so nice to have you here. - Very nice to meet you. - Please have a seat, please. - Thank-you. (jingling music) (audience applauding) - It's Paula Sands Live, where your opinions count, and here's the first lady of daytime talk, Paula Sands. - Thanks as always Brad, welcome studio audience. We do have a remarkable guest on the show today. And I still don't know how my producer pulled this one off but sitting right next to me is, forgive me, the killer mommy you've heard so much about. (audience mumbling) Mrs. Sterling, it must be painful to be characterized by such a cruel phrase. Tell us what it's like to be inside this media storm? - Well I'm, I'm living a very quiet life. I'm er, in a halfway house. - You're in an experimental program, some kind of new medication. - Yes, yes. - I don't know if you're free to speak about this, I don't know what your attorney has advised you. - Oh, he advised me not to appear. - But there's been another murder. And we know that you are once again under investigation. - That's partly why I'm here. I am absolutely positively 100% innocent of that crime. (audience groaning) - No way! - Get real! - Boo! - Please, please audience, you can see the kind of er, strong feelings you engender here, and maybe you're not convincing our studio audience Mrs. Sterling. - There's really only one person I want to convince, and it's a person who's being kept away from me. It's my daughter. - Well, I know that our audience is just dying to ask some questions of you, so Brad, you have our first question from the studio audience. - You say you want your daughter's attention. Is that why maybe you tried to strangle her? - I was told there wouldn't be any questions from the audience. - Oh Mrs. Sterling, I don't know where you got that impression but if you watch this show, this is our format. - No, but I'm-- - Brad another question from the audience. - Not comfortable with this. - Now, you say you love your daughter. Well girlfriend, you better get your stuff together before you start laying your own personal trip on her head, you hear what I'm saying, girlfriend. - I would never hurt my daughter. I, I love my daughter, more than life itself. - People like you don't deserve to live. Lethal injection is too damn good for you. They ought to hang your snooty ass. - Er that really isn't a question. Mrs. Sterling, you can see the strong feelings that you bring up in our audience. - I was promised that there would not be any questions from the audience. - Let's bring out our second guest for today. In fact, you've seen her before on this program. She has her own strong feelings about this subject. Jolene Jones, the sister of one of Mrs. Sterling's alleged victims. - [Mrs. Sterling] I will not be part of this. - Hey, don't you try to crawl away, you murdering (beeping) You are gonna sit here and face the (beeping) music this time. Ah, come on, look at me, huh, what are you, afraid? Look at me. You killed my sister. Some day you are gonna pay for it. You are gonna (beeping) pay. - We'll be right back after this word from our sponsor. Happy Family Dairy. Jerry. - Yes Paula. - Jerry, did Mrs. Sterling know that she was going to take those questions from the audience, and that she was appearing with Miss. Jones? - Our guests don't get to dictate the terms of their appearance, Paula. - Yes, I know but-- - You are a liar, and a heal. - Well, you are a murdering bitch. - Stay away from me. - Ah what, are you gonna fry me too. - It shut your sister up. - Listen to me you psycho bitch, ow, god! - Yeah, how would ladies feel about repeating this one on camera? - You're lucky I'm mellowed out. - Stand by. - On in three. (chattering) - Welcome back, and a reminder that on tomorrow's show born again, full-bodied tattooed bikers. - You need me Jerry? - Yeah, can you see if Phil's got that memo ready. Rating book came in today. - You got it. - Oh, and while you're at it, can you get rid of some of this garbage. Film, noir theater, who's idea was this? (heels clanking) - What was the idea today, Jerry? - Ratings. I just sent Chris after the latest. You'll see. - I thought we had an understanding, no more ambushing the guests. - That woman is not a guest. She is an ambush. - You got her on the show under false pretenses. Nevermind the right or wrong of that. Word gets out I can't be trusted, we're finished. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? You want to wait for the ratings memo? - You are a heal Jerry. Which must come in handy the way you walk all over people. I'll be in my office. (heels clanking) (pensive music) - Paula? (scaffolding clanking) (suspenseful music) (equipment scraping) (dramatic music) (light crashing) Oh. Oh. Hmm. (heel scraping) (heels clicking) - Everyone thinks you're a heal Jerry, a heel for a heal. (ominous music) (flesh squelching) (pensive music) - Jerry, here's your-- Oh woo, woo woo.

Yeah, that would be me. Listen, it's erm, it's vital that I see you. No, I don't think we should discuss this on the phone but er, trust me, this is a potentially lucrative venture.

For someone who supposedly getting the violence medicated out of her. (dramatic music) - A sudden impulse can get the best of any of us sergeant. Do you know what they did to me on that television program? - Yeah, yeah, I know. - Are you gonna arrest me? - No. I don't have enough, and anyway. - Some of the bite has gone out of your bark, sergeant. - Look, your shrink thinks that these murders aren't your style. - What do you think? - I think that if you decided to kill this sleazeball, you erm, wouldn't have tipped your hand in front of a studio audience, and you wouldn't have gouged his eyes out with that spiked heel either. Too messy. - If I were the person you think I am. And of course I'm not. I'm completely innocent. Never have and never would intentionally kill anyone. - Never? - I'd have made it look like an accident. I'd have made sure the falling light put his lights out. If I were the person you think I am. - Well, you, me and your head doctor know that this M.O. is all wrong for you. But it doesn't mean that you're not gonna wind up taking the fall. - But I, I didn't do these murders. (pensive music) - No no no no no, you never killed anybody remember. You're just a poor, innocent mom. Though somebody is trying to put in a very very fancy frame. (radio crackling) (keyboard clanking) - [Jolene] Thank-you Mrs. Conway. You have a lovely home. - Thank-you. Let me know if you need anything. - [Paul] Please, sit down, Miss. Jones. - Oh no, don't be so formal. Call me Jolene hmm. Listen, do you mind if I smoke? - Actually yes. My wife doesn't allow smoking in this house. - Well, I would've thought maybe you were in charge around here. I mean it was your mommy book that paid for all this, hmm. - Miss Jones, er Jolene, I'm on a deadline. Out of curtesy to your and your late sister-- - Oh oh, my late sister was trash. I mean I think she was a les or something. Now me, well I have more conventional tastes. - Hmm, please, lets get to the point. - Well the point is, reality don't count for nothing. Appearance is all. You know, doesn't matter if me and my late sister ain't spoke since high school. - Well why don't you tell me what does matter. (phone clicking) - Come on mommy, please. Mommy, mommy, I just saw that terrible woman. - Yes, she could be the one doing this to mommy. Dear, it means so much to me you calling me like this. Bye sweetheart. (phone clattering) - [Jolene] I'm an author too, you know. - [Paul] Really? - I wasn't lying about your publisher. Him and five others. They all want me. - For what? - Well, as soon as they nail your loony sister-in-law for these new murders, there's going to be room for a new mommy book on the bestseller list. - And you're going to write it? - Why don't we write it, together? - Ooh, I get it. With your charisma, the talk show circuit, my name next to yours on the cover. - Sequel to a bestseller. You know, I bet we'd work really well together. - You know, I just thought of something. - What's that? - My wife doesn't allow animals in this house either. You better go. - I don't need you to do this. This was just professional curtesy. (radio squawking) Listen, do we really need that jerk? Good, I didn't think so. A ghostwriter? What do you mean, like Stephen King? Oh, oh, all I do is talk into a tape, okay. How much do we have to pay? Really? Huh, no I hadn't thought of that. You know, I guess Conway would've taken a pretty big bite. You know, and that bestseller and all. Ah, so we're better off. Well all right, when do we start? Ah, baby I was born ready. Okay, okay, bye-bye. Ah, who needs you, you stuck up jerk. "My wife don't allow no smoking in the house." Yeah, I bet that ain't the only thing. Money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money money. (rings scraping) (water gushing) (tense music) (pensive music) (suspenseful music) (lively cassette music) (sparks zapping) (water gushing) (light music) - [Mrs. Sterling] Jessica Ann, wake up dear, wake up. - Mommy? - I'm, I'm leaving. - Leaving? - We both know that somebody's making this look like mommy. So I erm, I have some money hidden under a new name, and I'm gonna leave the country. - Will I ever see you? - No no no, I want you to come with me. - Oh mommy. - Please, Jessica Ann, we can start over. Clean, fresh, a second chance. - Mommy. (switch clicking) (Jessica gasping) - I want you out of here. Now. - But Beth, she's my baby. - Do you want me to call the police myself? - Beth, Beth, I don't think you better. Ladies, let's talk, come on. With all that's been going on, I've been listening to the police scanner in my office. - What's happened now? - Jolene Jones has been murdered. - It's my fault, I shouldn't have called you. I'm so sorry. - Oh no, no, baby, I didn't do this. You, you've got to believe me. - There's a warrant out for your arrest. - What happened? - [Paul] She was electrocuted. - Oh, no I didn't do this. I swear to god, I didn't do this. I haven't been committing these murders. I'm innocent. Please, please you have to believe me. - Well, I think it's time we talked to your attorney. (phone clicking) You remember his home telephone number? - Yeah. (phone beeping) (phone ringing) Ah, oh. - This is Neal Ekhardt. - It's his machine. - I'm out of town, but I will be checking my messages. (machine beeping) - Should I er, should I leave a message? Can I have him call me here? Ah Neal, this, you know who this is. I'm, I'm, it's urgent that we talk. I'm at my sister's. Okay. (phone beeping) (puffing) Thank-you. Can I erm, can I use the spare bedroom? (sobbing) (ominous music) (dramatic music) (door thumping) (engine revving) (pensive music) (dramatic music) - What? - They're gone. - Gone? - No no, no I don't think the girl's in any danger at all. No, listen Mrs. Conway, shh, listen, shh please. Now we both know she loves this little girl. She's not going to do anything to her. I'm gonna put an APB out on both of them. Yeah, I. I know, I know that! Last time she tried to leave the country, I know. No look please, listen to me. I need you to do something for me. Are you listening? - Yes. Yes. A photo. Yes sergeant, I'll be right down. He needs a photo of Jessica Ann to distribute. He already has one of my sister. - Hmm, here, you go, I'll watch the phone. Bye honey. (Paul sighing) (cup clinking) (Paul sighing) (phone ringing) (keys jingling) (door clattering) - I know. - [Woman] I've got the brat. - You know what you've got to do. - I want more. - More what? - [Woman] More, what do you think. Money dick weed. You want the kid dead, I want a percentage. - A percentage. - You're gonna make a bundle off of this little sequel you got. I'm the one doing stunt work. I want it in writing, a piece of the book, the movie, who knows, maybe they'll do a CD-ROM, mommy chasing baby around with a butcher knife. - You want a murder contract in writing? Are you completely out of your mind? - I'm a consulted, I want it in writing, and I want it now. - Where are you? - Where we made the first money drop, remember. Won't take you half an hour. At least it better not. (phone clanking) (phone clicking) (phone clanking) (dramatic music) (drawer handles clattering) (gun clicking) (chain clattering) - Oh. (tense music) - What are you doing here? Beth's out looking for you. We thought you took Jessica Ann. The police are looking for you. - I heard you on the phone. I know you've been framing me. I'd have known a lot sooner if it hadn't been for this. - You don't understand. I'm involved in a sting operation. Let me explain. - Oh, I wish I had time to listen. You really are an imaginative writer. But I have to help my daughter. - Oh, this isn't the ending I had in mind. (ominous music) But it'll work. - You know you may find it harder to actually kill someone, than to just write about it or hire a killer. It takes a special kind of person to take a life. (grunting) (gasping) Don't you know the sequel is never as good as the original. (crashing) (computer sparking) (electricity zapping) (glass exploding) (pensive music) (tense music) (ominous music) (exciting music) (water rushing) - Ah! - Thanks for running. I wondered if killing a kid would kind of get to me. But you causing me this much trouble helps. Your uncle said I should strangle you, to make it look more like your mommy did it. It's just not my style. - Oh please. - Why don't you pick on somebody your own size. - Help, mommy! (feet thumping) Ow. (tense music) - You know, imitation is the sincerest form of plagiarism. - I'm walking out of here. You keep your distance, maybe the kid keeps breathing. - You let her go and I'll you go. I have nothing against you. - Nothing against me. - Mommy! - I know you're just a working whore. By the way, you're out of a job. I'm afraid I just punched your meal ticket. (dramatic music) - Agh! (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (grunting) (knife whipping) - Ow. - Mommy. (gun firing) (wood splintering) (water gushing) (dramatic music) - Oh. (somber music) (Jessica sniffling) - Who is your best friend? - You are. - Who loves you more than anything on god's green earth? - You do. (Mrs. Sterling sighing) (sirens wailing) - [Anderson] Yeah, her name was Glenna Cole. Conway interviewed her for his contract killer book. - That's nice. - (laughing) Nice? - Well, I'm happy for your sergeant, tying up these loose ends. - How's your sister doing? - Hmm, she's home, but under sedation. Such an awful shock. I'm going to be moving in shortly. And she thinks she's well enough to attend Jessica Ann's staking competition. - Is your new implant in place? - Yes. No need to worry. - I guess I owe you an apology. Huh, but I should tell you though, that even your doctor admitted something to me. - Really? - Oh yeah. That last killing. Jolene Jones. That one really did fit your M.O. - But now, I thought you had cleared all those murders off the books? - Yeah we did. So I guess only Jolene Jones herself can identify her killer huh? - It's a pity you can't ask her.
