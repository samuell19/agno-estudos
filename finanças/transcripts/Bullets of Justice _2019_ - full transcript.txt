It's him, do it! Shoot him in the fucking muzzle. Rob, what's the matter with you? Now do it! Shoot him in the fucking muzzle. Come on, shoot the fuckin' pig. What happened with you? You had visions, again? Cut his ears. We got him first, Taraz. This is war. Do you want to know how it all started? I'll tell you. It was during the third world war. There wasn't much left. 70% of humans died. I don't remember my real father, but I remember him. Rob, come I want to show you something. The man who made me what I am. See, they don't go nowhere. They just turn into dirty old bones. God is a human mistake. We die 'cause of some shit. And we die full of shit. A good man with his own issues with God. There's no God. Don't be fooled. This is my sister, Raksha. She never loses a fight. Rats, let's go get some candy. Nastja, where are you you fat bitch? Hey wait, wait, wait. That was the day I saw Muzzle for the first time. This creature attacked my father. Then militarists came. But not for help. Prepare to execute code 666. Hey, this monster killed my friend. Prepare to execute code 666. No, wait, wait there's some mistake! They killed my father, burned the bodies, destroying every evidence. We escaped. There's no God. Don't be fooled. You want to pray to something, pray to yourselves. No one knew who created the first Muzzle, the hybrid between human and pig. Americans blamed Russians and Russians blamed Americans. Someone finished Hitler's Uber-sold-at-an project. But then something went wrong and Muzzles got out of control and enslaved humans. They started farming us like animals. We became their favorite meal. The remains of Russian and American armies collaborated in a desperate attempt to fix the situation. They've deployed a biological weapon which was supposed to kill Muzzles. But all it did was making every species sterile except the holy mother. She was their biggest advantage as she could still produce Muzzles. It's a giant human pig. But nobody have seen her. They say she eats half ton of human meat every day. So me and Raksha intercepted every delivery truck in order to find her. But they never betray her, no matter how much we torture them. We have to go. His gang will come looking for us. No, not before I take my medal of honor. My assistant. The girl with ass like hell. But mine, I think mine is better. The best in the world. But except one. Rob. Rob, are you here? Even when you're fucking me, you're thinking about this asshole Rafael. You're obsessed with this contest. Just a dream, Rob. It's not even real. I'm sorry. I cannot control it. They just appear in my head. Bullshit. But what is real. I have a feeling this time it's gonna happen. Come on baby, no way. I can feel it inside me, a new life. You know it's impossible. I can feel it. Rob. Astana. Lyudmila, it was a trap. My assistant Nina, she's dead. Cry for pussy? Don't cry for pussy. Life is shit. But this is what you deserve. That was a teen muzzle you tricked me to kill. Who was the real target? Oh Robbie, don't start again my boy. This thing killed three of our best informers. He deserved to die, don't suffer. I'm not, but my assistant did, and someone has to pay. Now tell me the truth. Vydra, leave us. Was a secret meeting between this Muzzle called Yuri and Asshole. Asshole, Benedict Asshole? Mm-hmm. We executed the special operation to catch Asshole - before they met. - Benedict Asshole? Yes, Benedict Asshole. We were afraid that if Asshole wouldn't show up, Yuri would start to be suspicious. That's why we sent you to identify him. Taraz-Bulba wasn't planned, so don't judge us. Only God can. - Benedict Asshole, finally. - Yes. What's on the plate? Asshole knows the location of secret human farm, called "The Liver", which is somewhere in New York. Every Monday, a special truck delivers fresh human meat for the mother. Can I get a payment for this one? You must get into the farm, trace the truck and kill the mother. This is not my war, Lyudmila. It's not about you. It's about humanity. I think humanity does not deserve to be saved. We had our chance. I will give you a big reward. This is not about money, Lyudmila. This is our last chance to win. My father told me that God... Is a human mistake. But I think humanity is God's mistake. And I've seen so much pain. Look into my car, Lyudmila. It's full of pictures of dead girls. You are the best. Where is the location of "The Liver"? Where is "The Liver"? I'll count to three. One. Two. Three. Put him back in the cage. They'd never betray their own kind. They're not like humans. Rob, I need you. Go to the bar and get some drink. And please, don't reject this operation. Your father would be proud of you. Not yet, you'll be fine. I don't want to die. Girls, the one who survives gonna be riding Rob's dick all night. Come on! Rendezvous in two minutes. I need a few minutes more. I know how you feel. How can you know? You're just a machine. I understand human emotions. But I don't understand their actions. But I have a question. Why do you have a mustache? You don't want to know. Don't be sad, Rob. I deserve to be the best model. You're just a poor boy. I'm sorry, I can't stay here and look at you how lonely you are. Let me introduce you to some chicks. May I introduce you to the second place of this contest, Rob Justice. Nice to meet you, Rob. You look just like my sister, except she has a mustache. You bastard. You motherfucker, where have you been? Why did you leave me for so long? It wasn't my fault. I was in some deep pork shit. Askar sent me with the recruits, but they are dead. I know, it's impossible to get through the forest. Shh, kiss me. - But I knocked them out. - I know. - I never lose a fight. - I know. - I knocked them out. - I know. I never lose a fight. You never lose a fight. Let's go to my place. Rob, don't you think you owe us some answers? Tell us what the hell happened over there in Astana. And where the fuck did you disappear to? Heard you dancin' with the pigs while we're dyin' here. You couldn't do it if you wanted to. Not here, not now. You're already a dead man. I'm coming with you. No, it's too dangerous. Do I have anything to lose except you? I can't be a mother. I can't have family and kids. Why should I be scared? You still get visions like before? Yeah, sometimes. Don't worry, I want you to know to me you're my Mr. Universe. So what's the plan? I'm gonna help Asshole to escape. What? Don't worry, I'm on your side. I'll help you. Tomorrow. Are you gonna put a tracker on him? I need the location of "The Liver". Yes, I will. God bless you. You are a genius. But don't lose him. Now he knows where our base is. God might lose him, but I won't. We must land and leave the chopper. They're fast as hell, you know that. He entered the central park. We can trace him on the ground. No, it's too dangerous. What? We're landing. Let's get inside and kill them all. We must hurry. This is not our war. The truck is ready to depart. We must hurry. I've changed my mind. We should spend some time here. Never trust humans. But this is not Benedict Asshole. This is Robert Asshole. - Benedict Asshole? - Yes, Benedict Asshole. I ran out of bullets. Me either. What about these? Just decoration. Don't worry, you know I never lose a fight. Askar! Come on, bro, let's go. I have a plan. I hate that I love you. Raksha, Raksha. Rob, I cannot breathe, here. Raksha. Oh my God, we're gonna die here. There is no God. Agent Rafael, report. Is everything going according to the plan? Tell the mother they've swallowed the bait. Why did you leave me for so long? I'm sorry. Why did you leave me for so long? I was in some deep pork shit. - That's not me. - No! - Get away from her. - Put the gun down. - Get away from her. - Put the gun down! - Protect our baby. - Put the gun down. - That's not me. - Baby, save the three of us. - Raksha. - Save our child. - Raksha, put the gun down. - Get away from her. Raksha, put the gun down now. - Protect our baby. - Put the gun down. - Get away from her. - Don't listen to her. No, no. I swear I'll shoot you. - She's not me, Rob. - Now put your gun down now. - Please. - You're not real. - She's not me. - She's real. Cuckoo. Don't cry for pussy. Life is shit, but this is what you deserve. Vydra, can you hear me? Which year is it? Where am I? Rob Justice? Do you remember how she looks like? Krasnajq Pizda. I remember her. She was my assistant. I trained her. Tell the mother, they've swallowed the bait. They tried to play us. There was a betrayer among us. - Raksha. - Oh my God. We're gonna die here. Tell me about this long-haired warrior. Was he beautiful and eye catching? Yeah, I know. I want to meet him in a battle. To a safe place. - Raksha. - Rob? Raksha, it's me. You in a Muzzler tracer? I cannot believe. How can you be so? I know, we promised to kill every truck that we meet. The coordinates you gave me were 50 miles away. Fuck, Cristiano. Cristiano, Rob. I know how you feel. How can you know, fucking machine? Come on bro, when it's raining you always get wet. Come on. Are we safe here? You know they're afraid of water. Yes, but they're learning fast, evolving. I think we're losing the war. What happened? You dream the time this time? Did you save my father? This time I was late. But at least I was in the correct year. We must steal a gun from guard. And then what? Then kill everybody in the base, everybody. Can't wait. They're all guilty. I miss my dad so much. Shh, shh, shh. I'm on your side, I'm on your side. Who are you? I'm you, Rob, and you are me, but 25 years later. I'm here to help. So help me, take me out of here. No, I can't take you with me. You must go along through all the adventures to become me. You are very beautiful. Can I wake up Raksha to show her how brave and strong one day I'll become? No, don't tell her anything. Can you promise me something? Yes. Tomorrow, don't attack the military base. Your sister will get hurt and she'll suffer till the end of her life, carrying metal braces just to walk. I must revenge for my father. You will, but later. Are you sure? Of course. You're living my life. Okay, I promise. Give me your hand. This is just to remind you that it wasn't a dream. Rob, Rob, we are late. Calm down, Raksha. Let's wait couple of days. How can you change your mind so fast, fucking coward? No, I'm not. I just had a prophet dream. Oh my God, Rob, I'm walking alone. There is no God. We call it teleport. What I have to tell the mother now? That you're an idiot? How can you let them to escape? I thought Rob and his sister are dead. They will. Commander, please, give me a chance. I promise they'll die faster than you can predict. Agent Rafael, this is your last chance. If you fail again, I will send you where you belong to. You will spend your whole miserable life at the catwalk. Two humans are approaching. - Should I exterminate them? - No. It smells like a trap. But what if it's not? We cannot hide it forever. You two supposed to be dead. Ester, is that you? You left me. But you know, bullets always fair. What is this? - Benedict Asshole. - Benedict Asshole? Benedict Asshole. It's not Benedict Asshole. This is Massimo Zardi. I want to be your assistant. That's why I'm here. That's why I went through the forest. You know the protocol. - I do, master. - Let's go. Krasnaq Pizda. Vydra! Where is Rafael? Where is the crypt? Who are you? I have questions. But I don't have answers. Where is the mother? Why do I have visions? Oh Robbie, poor boy. You really think everything is so simple? So what if I tell you everything? That I'm this. That you're having visions because of that. That the mother is there. Then I would have answers. What if you're having the wrong questions? What if you're wrong? Then what? Open your eyes, Rob. People are dying. They can't reproduce anymore. Humanity is dead. Muzzles won. They're the future. Even if you manage to kill the mother, what will you win? Several years of pathetic human existence? And then what? We had our chance. Actually hold on, didn't you say, humanity doesn't need... How'd you know? Let me tell you. You see, Rob, white implies black, light implies death. Actually when I think about it, death implies life. For one to exist, there has to be another one. For every hero, there has to be a villain. Have you ever wondered why even with a teleport at your disposal, - you couldn't catch the mother? - Why? Because deep inside you know you're nothing without your revenge. You need the mother. You need the suffering of humanity. You need the constant state of war in order for Rob Justice, the legendary warrior, to exist. What if I told you that war has ended many times in the future and you're the one that keeps coming back to relive it over, and over, and over again? You're just a filthy liar. You okay Rob? Hey dude, are you trippin' again? Are you okay, Rob? Come on guys, we are late for the show. This is Massimo Zardi. It's not a joke. Come on man, get back from apocalypse. It's Rafael, we have to hurry. I'm okay, Uve, I'm okay. You better be on point, bitches. Hey, please wait, Rob is coming. He can use his damn teleport. Don't think about it. Sorry babe, we're full. That one belongs to the mother.
