Grab a beer and plant yourselves in a chair. Thank you. Okay, so, first of all, I want to thank our client for coming all the way out to Portland today. I know this is not New York, but we are pretty sure that after today's presentation, that is not going to matter. I would like to bring up our creative director, Lawrence Shaw. Come on up. Lawrence Shaw, everyone. - Thanks Martin. Yeah, hi there. I am Lawrence Shaw, creative director here at White and Kennerby, and today I'm gonna ask you to step outside your comfort zone, and join me on a journey, a journey of the imagination. Yours, to be exact. So, sit back, relax, let's just ease our way into this. What do you say? All right, let's begin with the breakdown of your client. Let's begin to imagine for a second that your client sounds a little somethin' like this. Let's imagine he drives an all American four wheel pickup truck, with gun racks. Throw in a couple of political bumper stickers and some young hotties in camo bikinis, of course. Heck, while we're at it, let's throw in some jet skies, maybe a dog or two, and turn up that music. I mean, whatever's chartin' in Nashville will do, or something a bit edgier. Can be like '90s rap rock. How about your client's faded old ball cap? Can you tell me what team's logo's on it? I didn't think so. That's okay, that's why we're here. Just sit back, relax, and join me on a journey, a journey of the imagination. Yours, to be exact. - Tell you what, boys, when I heard we were coming to Portland, all I could think about was micro brews and granola, and all kinds of gay shit. And that stuff is just suicide for our brand. - And we can't have that. - No, no, we've been around for over a hundred years, and there's good reason. Yes, indeed, yes we have. But Lawrence, you, you just seem to get our client. It's uncanny how you're... - It's like he's inside his head or something. - That's it. - Well, Lawrence here is our brightest young star at the agency, so... - Ah, well, bright young star, what's your secret? We need to know. - Well, let's just say that I have some very vivid and real examples in my personal life. - Okay. Okay. I think we can buy that. - Yeah, I think we might be persuaded to take that. Congratulations, gentlemen, you just got yourself a new account. (laughs) - We don't wait for someone to come in and deliver big ideas, and you boys did that like gangbusters. - Yeah, I can honestly say I haven't been this excited about a campaign in a long time. - Oh well, that is great. That is great news, guys. - Thank you, thank you so much. - No, it's our pleasure. Can't wait to get started. - Yeah, the sooner the better. - And look what time it's coming to be. - Whoa. - Wow, yeah, look at that. - Gentlemen, we've gotta get back to Colorado, kiss the little misses and the babies goodnight. The old balls and chains. - Yeah, I hear that. - Got kids, Lawrence? - Me, no no, not yet, but, you know, we're definitely tryin' for it. - Well, good man. Next trip out here we'll get all the little ladies together, huh? - Oh yeah, and maybe we'll play a game or two of golf. Oh, we love to golf. - That sounds, yeah. - Fantastic, gentlemen. Thank you much. - Later to you, amigos. Adios. - Talent, I know talent. - Yes, you are. Don't forget to buckle up on the airplane. - Hey. - Yeah. - That was a great save on the whole wife thing. I know that they are, these guys are really into traditional family values, so it's, that's... I appreciate it. - Yeah, you got it. - Hey. - Good job. - No, you. That was fantastic. - To me. - Hey, to you. I'm taking this to go. - [Lawrence] Okay. - Don't drink too much. - I won't, I'll try and stop me. (gentle music) I don't know. I just feel like I can't be myself. - [Man] Yeah, and you got the accounting. - Yeah, of course. - Okay, so, what's the problem. - If I act like who I really am, then I don't. You're not taking this seriously. - I am taking it seriously. I just think it's funny to hear that coming from you, of all people. You are literally like the least gay, gay man that I've ever met. - That's not true. - Seriously? You don't like going to clubs, you don't work out, this place looks like hell. - Okay. - We barely have sex. - I've been really busy, and I don't particularly care for all that other stuff. - Yeah, okay, but, well, I do. - All right, we're supposed to be celebrating my big account. - Baby, that's what I'm talking about. I hate to break this to you, but I think this isn't much of a celebration. - So, what, are you breaking up? (phone vibrating) (gentle music) Yes, this is him. What? Okay. Okay. Thank you. ♪ La, la la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la, la, ♪ La, la la la la, la la la la, la - We shall all miss Elijah Shaw's generous and civic minded nature. His wry sense of humor and wit, his penchant for no BS and straight shooting. And we shall always look up to him and appreciation the tenacity with which he tackled his roles as a father, a husband, and philanthropist. Ladies and gentlemen, Elijah Shaw was a real and tangible example of God's will, and a pillar of strength in our community. He will be missed, folks. He will truly be missed. God bless Elijah, and may he rest in peace for all eternity. Let us pray. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Blessed be the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ. - Wow, he looks dead. - I was gonna say the same. - Yeah, but dead. - What happened to your mouth? - Oh. (laughs) This lively bridge down at the old country club. Nice glasses, by the way. They make you look gay. - Well, that's good, 'cause I am. - Do you see how his mouth is open, like just enough. Does that make ya think about dicks, Lawrence? - [Parishioner] Are you boys about done? - I gotta abort a turd baby. - [Lawrence] We're done. - Thank you. - Mr. Shaw, so nice of you to join us, even if you're a bit tardy. - Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, flights, you know. - Understandable. I just wanted to give you my condolences, that my heart goes out to your family. - Thank you so much. - It's my pleasure. You know, Elijah was a great man. - Well, that's what I'm told. - Anyway, if I could get the balance. - I'm sorry. - We tried your mom's credit card this morning, and it didn't go through, and your brother Kevin's... - Half brother. - Apologies. Kevin said you gonna take care of it, so if we could get just a... - Of course he did. - Just a payment. - Right now? - That would be wonderful. It was a lovely service. - You know what, could we do this not here? - Oh, my office. - Yeah. - Wonderful, yes, of course. - That's great, okay. - Oh, Lawrence. - Oh hey. - Hey, I'm glad I caught ya. I just wanted to give you my condolences, et cetera. - Thanks for comin'. - Oh, I wouldn't have missed it for the world. Elijah was a terrible poker player, but one hell of a man nonetheless. Anyway, I also wanted to just apologize again for what happened with Kevin the other night. Oh, you two haven't talked? - No, it's been a while. - I see. Well, he kind of drove up on us right after the incident. - Incident? I thought my father hit a tree. - Oh, he did. But, there was a couple of things that we need to clear up. Really haven't had a chance to talk with June or Kevin about this yet, but we're investigating a few things that seemed a little bit odd. - Okay. - So, you mind doing this now, or? - Yeah, why not? I mean, I'm not sentimental, so... - Okay, so, for one, really didn't find any evidence of braking or stopping at the scene. - Okay. - And there's some eyewitness reports of Elijah being pretty drunk at a charity event for a children's hospital. It was right before. - Yeah, well, I mean, my father enjoyed his scotch. - Oh, that he did, but, apparently he gave a disturbing speech about the frailties of life and whatnot. - What? - That was my first reaction too. - Yeah, that's a little... - [Sheriff] Bit odd, considering the man, to be sure. - Yeah, I would say so. - So, tell me, when was the last time you actually spoke with Elijah? - I would say it's been a few months. - Were you aware that he had cancer? - No, I was not. - [Sheriff] He had stage four prostate, according to his doctor anyway. I guess he wanted to keep his condition private. I guess he didn't wanna burden anyone. - So, June and Kevin? - [Sheriff] Not as far as I know. - You don't think that he... - Well, you know, we're gonna put a comb through it, and we're gonna look at it some more, but it is a possibility. ♪ La, la la la la (gentle music) - What the hell happened to you? - I was talking to the sheriff. - Oh. - You okay? - Not gonna cry about it, if that's what you're askin'. - No, I'm just wondering if he'd heard anything. - If you really wanna do something for me, Lawrence, you can give me a ride back to the house. My feet are killin' me. - What happened to your truck? - Oh, you know, fascists holding it hostage down at the impound lot again. - Another DUI. - I like to call them special awards from the fun police, but no one's askin' me. Hey, you think you coulda found yourself a smaller or brighter car to rent? - You want a ride or not? - I'm forgettin' you guys like these small, tight, confined spaces.

Go ahead. Don't you wanna watch? (bottle cap clanking) - [Lawrence] I thought you were off the sauce. - I'm dry as a bone. (deep exhaling) How's Portland treatin' ya? Banging lots of dudes? - I'd rather not talk about that... (glass shattering) - Mother's home. (dramatic music) - [Lawrence] Is she drunk? - It's hard to say. I mean, I fed her a bunch of Klonopin before the funeral, but... - You can't just drug my mother, Kevin. - She was being really annoying. Nice job, June. Love you too. - June, let me help you. - Don't touch me. - Mother. - [June] No, don't you touch me. - Mother, it's Lawrence. - Oh, Lawrence. My baby. I thought that was you, but I wasn't sure. I've been seeing things. - She's hallucinating. This is awesome. - Can you please help me here? - Here you go, June. Up and at 'em. - All right, you okay? - I'm just fine. Fine and dandy. Now, listen to me, Lawrence. I need you to go inside the house and entertain that lawyer when he gets here. I need to go freshen up. - Okay. You got it. - Can you imagine what she is gonna do when she finds out he punched his own ticket? - We don't know that yet. - The hell we don't. I was there, Lawrence. I saw the whole thing. He killed himself. - Hey. - He fucking killed himself. - Stop. - Please make yourself at home. June will be down in a minute. - Well, I charge by the hour, so... - Nice one. That's good. June. Bloodsucker's here. Sorry, she's probably curling her pubes or something. - That's okay, it'll give me a chance to get set up and settled. - Something to drink, Mr. Bartlett? - Please, call me Tom. - Okay, Tom, can I get you anything? - No, I'm fine. - All right, well, you just let me know. - I will definitely do that. Oh, before I forget. Here's my card. Feel free to call me anytime. Day or night. - I may just do that. - Why don't you guys just suck each other's dicks while you're at it? - I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. Don't start without me. You must be Mr. Bartlett. - Oh, please, call me Tom. - Yeah, him and Lawrence are goin' on a date later, June. - Shut up. - It's nice to meet you, Tom. Would you like a soft drink or a cocktail? - No, I'm good. Thanks. - Well, how about some cookies? I just put some cookies in the oven, they're peanut butter. Would you like some of those? - For the love of God, June, the man doesn't want anything. Just leave him alone. - I'm just trying to be polite. - Yeah, well, don't bother. Elijah is dead. Let's just read this will, and get this whole goddamn thing over with. - Oh, you are a vile, vile person, Kevin Shaw. - Oh yeah? Well, the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree now, does it? (sobbing) - Good job. (sobbing) - I, Elijah Sampson Shaw, being of sound mind and disposing memory do hereby make publish and declare this to be my last will and testament. I direct my executer, Mr. Thomas Bartlett, attorney at law, to pay all of my debts and funeral expenses as well as the expenses of the administration of my estate within 72 hours of my passing, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. - God. - Well, it's pretty straight forward, actually. We have the house, the life insurance, the debt, and a couple of other issues. So, why don't we start with the house? Okay. It looks like Elijah has left the house to the two of you. You two, the sons, in equal halves. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, to me and Lawrence? - That is correct. - No, that can't be right. - Yeah, yeah, Lawrence hasn't been around in years. - [Lawrence] So what? - [Kevin] So you weren't exactly the model son now, were you? - And you were? - Yeah, at least I was here. Can you read that again? - Yes, would you? I would really like to hear that part again, please, Tom. - Yes, of course, of course. A split between Kevin and Lawrence Shaw in equal halves. - Man, I need a drink. - Oh God! Oh. ♪ La, la la la la, la la la la I would appreciate it if you wouldn't smoke inside of my house, Kevin. - I guess we got a problem then, June, because this ain't your house anymore. - I'm actually allergic to cigarette smoke, so, if you wouldn't mind Kevin. - Can you put it out, please? - Thank you. Okay, so regarding the life insurance settlement, it looks like all remaining proceeds go to June Upland Shaw. - What? - Oh, thank God. - Let me explain. There's a couple of things... - This is complete horse shit. - Listen, let me say, he bought this in 1978, so it's not worth very much. - Ha! - Just get away from me, you evil person! - Kevin, sit down. Sit down. - Now, I did say remaining, as there are years of unpaid property taxes, and the house is dangerously close to foreclosure. So... (gentle music) Look, Elijah set this up specifically, so the insurance would keep the debtors at bay, and in the meantime, you all could sell the house and split the proceeds. Of course, this does assume that the criteria for the payout are properly matter. - Criteria, Mr. Bartlett? - Yes, there needs to be verification of exactly how the deceased passed before the determination. - Well, that's easy. Elijah ran into a tree. - That's how it would appear to all parties involved, but the sheriff's department is still investigating the incident, so... - Incident? Don't you mean accident? - Actually, they're calling it an incident for now, because... - Elijah killed himself, June. - [Lawrence] Great job. - [June] What? - What, why beat around the bush? - I'm sorry, what did he just... What did, I don't understand. - The sheriff thinks that he may have forgotten to apply his brakes. - Or just killed himself, you know, like punched his own ticket, cashed in his chips, checked himself out. You know, like killed himself. - [June] Oh my God! - Mother, they don't know that for sure. - That is not true. I was there, I saw it with my own eyes, Lawrence. - They're still investigating, June, and as of right now it could go either way at this point. - Yeah, kind of like these guys, June. They just flip a coin and stick their penis into something. - Kevin, that is so inappropriate. - Not to mention completely untrue. - All of you please just shut up! Kevin, do you happen to have anymore of those... - [Kevin] Happy pills? - Yes, the happy pills. - Medicine cabinet in the bathroom. Help yourself. - I shall. - Let the party begin. - You're not funny. (gentle music) - Hey, can we wrap this up? It's ladies night not down at O'Malligans and I need to get my sport fuck on. What? It's two dollar tequila shots, can be like shootin' fish in a barrel. If fish had vaginas. - I'm sorry, Tom. Can we start without June? - I'm afraid we can't. - June! Get out of my stash! Let's go. - My apologies. I'm feeling much, much, much better now. - Hell yeah. - [Lawrence] If we could... - Yes, let's talk about the burial. - That would be nice. - That'd be great. - So is Elijah being cremated, or... - He's being torched as we speak. - I was told that I could pick him up tomorrow. - Perfect. That will make transporting him much easier. - I'm sorry, did you say transport? - Ah, yes. It is Elijah's final wish to be buried at the Carpinteria Cemetery in Carpinteria, California, next to his first wife, Summer Shaw. - [June] What? - His mother? - That sneaky son of a bitch. - [June] There must be some kind of mistake. - I'm afraid that the insurance settlement and the transfer of the deed to the house are all contingent on Elijah's ashes being buried in the manner that he requested. Otherwise, all of it, everything, goes to County Children's Cancer Hospital. It's all right here. (screaming) (glass shattering) - Well, it's official. The cuckoo bird has finally landed. - I'm real sorry, Tom. - I just hope she doesn't hurt herself. - Oh, this is nothin'. I'm just so happy she hasn't found... (gun firing) Guns. - Jesus Christ. Is my mother discharging firearms? - No, she's eatin' bonbons. What do you think? Of course she is. Elijah's got guns all over the house. - Boys, if I were you, I would bury your father the way he requested or you're going to lose everything. Remember, call me with any questions. Or, just call me. - Really? At a time like this? Come on. Maybe she, you know, shot herself in the mouth or somethin'. - Don't even joke about that. - I'm not joking. It would make things so much easier. So much for easy. All right, O'Malligans. Let's go, he's gonna be my wing man. It's gonna be raging. (glass shattering) - Fine. - Can I get a beer? - [Bartender] Sure. - You were right about this place. It's definitely raging. - Yeah, well, I still got me one option to take to pound town, so... - I wish I could drink with you. - [Kevin] So, bein' pretty busy tonight? - [Bartender] Ah, just that jackass over there. - You think I can't take her boyfriend? - That's not her boyfriend, trust me. - Did you just do gay stuff with that guy in the bathroom? - Maybe, maybe not. - Not cool, Lawrence. Not cool. This is my local watering hole, and I would really appreciate it if you do not sully it with your perverted lifestyle, okay? Here she comes. I can't wait to make her squirt all over your mom's couch later. You can watch if you want. - [Bartender] Last call. Do you guys want anything? - Yeah, a couple shots of tequila and two more beers, and your number. - I'm not giving you my number, Kevin. - Come on, Jess. - No, I said no, and I meant it. Anything for you? - [Lawrence] No, thanks, I'm driving. - [Bartender] That'll be 12 dollars. - Can you spot me? I'm strapped. - I thought you were working as a farm handler or laborer. - I was, as ranch foreman, actually, but I kind of ran over the owner's dog, Reginald, with a tractor. - Well, that sounds awful. - Here we go. To dear old Dad. May he burn in the eternal hellfires of damnation for all eternity and forever. Rest in peace, you horny old bastard. All right, here is the plan, o half brother of mine. You and me are gonna go liberate you know who from you know where, and we are gonna drive him up to you know where and bury his you know what next to my mother. - You mean steal his ashes? - Yeah, however you wanna slice it, Lawrence. And I'm broke. These are desperate times for me. I mean, I'm literally this close to living in a cardboard box under the highways. - But we do know the will names both of us. - Yeah, I know, and your mother is messin' that all up. Messin' it up! - No, I don't know about that. I think she's just a little upset. - She's needs this more than I do, okay. I mean, unless you're plannin' on taking care of her for the rest of her life until she dies or kicks off or whatever. - Well, I wasn't. - Me either. Unless she puts out. Just kidding. (dramatic music) - I don't know about this, Kevin. - I don't see what the problem with parking in the handicap spot is. I mean, nobody's here, it's not a problem. - I'm not talking about that, and you know it. - Oh, okay, well, let's go back and pack up all of June's stuff and move her in with you then, and see what kind of cramp that puts in your carefree, gay lifestyle. - Yeah, we're definitely not doing that. - Yeah, good, 'cause you sure as hell ain't living with me under the freeway over highway pass. That is where I draw the line, my friend. Oh God. I gotta yak. Oh God. - Outside. Go, hurry, hurry, hurry, I don't have insurance. Hurry. (belching) - Oh God. It's gotta be in here somewhere. - I think we should wait, because we don't have a legal claim on his ashes. - [Kevin] Legal claim. Like, can we? God, you're such a pussy sometimes. - Okay, but what if we get arrested? This will be like an average Saturday night for me, Lawrence. - [Lawrence] It will not for me. - I mean, it'd be like a vacation for you. Free food, all the man sex you could ever want for. I mean, come on. - [Lawrence] Kevin, it's illegal. - Ah, there it is. Lawrence, that is our father in there, and for some God forsaken reason, he wants to be buried next to my witch of a mother. Now, it's not our place to judge the stupidity of those last wishes or his horrendous taste in women, but it is our obligation as his sons to carry them out. - I don't know. - You know what, I'm gonna go anyway, and you drove me here, so technically you're already my accomplice. Watch your puss. All right, let's fuckin' do this. - [Lawrence] Where are you goin'? - [Kevin] Oh yeah, yeah. What the fuck is goin' on? Holy crap. Relax. - [Lawrence] Is he dead? - No, he's sleeping. Come on, let's go. I don't know, they're all numbered. I mean, does it even matter? They're just ashes. - Yeah, it matters, Kevin. 2127? - There's no 2127, Lawrence. - 2124. That's it. - [Kevin] Hey Dad, all right. - Let's go. (banging) What was that? - Turn that off.

It really, really sucks. - Well, if it makes you feel any better, I don't think he told anybody. - It doesn't. Guess he went out with a bang, right? - Oh yeah. - Lawrence, I say for our final act of paternal defiance, we take that urn, and we piss in it until the cup runneth over. - Kevin, as much as I'd like to do that, I think that's something that Elijah would expect us to do, and so nope. I am not gonna give him the satisfaction. - That's pretty impressive. I don't think I've seen you show that much character since I walked in on you and the neighbor's dad. - Uncle. - Whatever. You're right, as always. We can't give him that. No way. Fuck you, Elijah. Fuck you. We're gonna bury you the way that you wanted. Take that, you old prick.

Don't mind if I do. - What are those for? - Your my last living male relative, Lawrence, and I don't want ya to happen dying of AIDS on me. - I don't think people die of AIDS anymore. - Well, that depends on what kind of AIDS. I mean, there's a butt load of AIDS out there these days. - [Lawrence] I'm pretty sure there's only one kind. - Well, just wrap your dong in it when you're doin' your thing, whatever you're puttin' your thing in. Just wrap your dong. - [Lawrence] All right, thanks, I'll try to remember that. - Good. - [Jeanette] Okay, here you go. - I may have to marry this one, Lawrence. - So, what can I get for you guys? - I will have a poached egg, raw tomato, no butter on my wheat toast. - Okay, and for you? - Well, I'll take the hash, whatever way you like it best, Jeanette. - Anything else? - Yeah, tell me, how come such a beautiful thing as yourself is not married yet? - You know, I'm sorry, but does this usually work for you? - I'll have you know that in some circles I'm considered quite a catch. Possibly even an Adonis. What are you laughing about? - Those must be some pretty interesting circles. Anything else? - I'll get your phone number later, Jeanette, but nothin' else for now. - Please stop saying my name. - That went really well. - Yeah, I think she's just playing hard to get. - Nice face. Call me. - Man, life for you is just one giant, gay sex buffet, isn't it? All I'm sayin' is, it's not the worst idea in the world. - [Lawrence] No, you're right, there are worse ideas out there. - Just think about it. We'll be out on the lake. Me in my captain's hat, you in your speedos or whatever you guys where. - It's not gonna happen, Kevin. - Okay, besides all your man whores, what do you really have to go back to in Portland? - My life, my job, my friends, my apartment. - Who the hell needs all that garbage? - I do. Why are you so keen on us being best buds again anyway? - Okay, first of all, I don't remember us ever being best buds, and secondly, I'm just tryin' to connect with you, on like a bro level, man. - Well, I think you should just give it a rest. I'm sorry. - Fine. You don't wanna get a boat, we'll get a dune buggy. They're bitchin'. Hey, can I get your... - No, you cannot have my number. - But I would really... - I'm not gonna go out with you either. Thank you. - What is it with women in these states, Lawrence? - Don't think it's the women, Kevin. - Let me have a couple bucks so I can leave you know who an extra tip. - Please leave her alone. - Hey man, we can't all get BJs on demand like you. Some of us gotta, you know. - Pay for it. - No, of course not. Well, yeah, sometimes. Thanks. Hey, it was great mettin' you, Jeanette. Maybe we can... - Not in a million years. - But maybe I could just leave my... - Don't even bother. - She wants me. - I'm really sorry about that, Tom. I don't why she called you either. - I mean, do you boys understand the size of the shit storm that you've gotten yourselves into? You can't do this sort of thing. It's not legal. - I'm really sorry, Tom, but what's done is done. So, any word yet from the sheriff? - Yeah, and he's not too happy with you two. But he did say that it's difficult to prove suicide with someone as drunk as Elijah was. Look, I gotta go. Call me, we'll spa. - [Kevin] So dude already knows? - [Lawrence] And the Sheriff. - [Kevin] Wow, that was amazing. That one can really hold her narcotics. - [Lawrence] You know, I'd really appreciate it if you wouldn't give my mother anymore drugs, Kevin. - [Kevin] Take it up with her, Lawrence, she's the one with the problem. - Oh no. - No way. (laughs) - This isn't happening. - I mean who the hell would steal that little yellow butt plug of a car? That is amazing. - Doo, I should have gotten the insurance. - Hold on a second, buddy. Don't get you panties in a bunch just yet. Look. It's been held by the fascists. Goddamn epidemic, Lawrence. I'm tellin' ya. - I understand that, but my father did die. No, I was not close to him. That doesn't matter, does it? Yeah, we'll get on in a few days. All right. Bye. - Was that one of your man whores? - No, work. - How about a piggy back ride? - Yeah, if you give me one first. - Hell no, I don't want you gettin' all excited on my back or somethin'. - [Lawrence] Yeah, 'cause that'll definitely happen. - [Kevin] You never know. I mean, you might get excited. - [Lawrence] Yeah. - [Kevin] If I gave you a piggy back ride. - [Lawrence] You might get a freakin' college degree one day. - [Kevin] I know you secretly just wanted to mount me. - [Lawrence] What? - [Kevin] This while time growin' up. I just know you did. It's fine, Lawrence. I mean, if you're attracted to me, it's fine, I just, you know, just accept it. I mean, I'm kind of an Adonis. I'm like an attractive guy, you know. - [Lawrence] I also don't think you know what Adonis means. - Maybe they'll give us a ride or somethin'. - What, no? That's a prison bus. - I don't care. I'm sweatin' my balls off, and my head really hurts. - Well, maybe you shouldn't have drank so much tequila last night. - Okay, that is so unfair. - Oh, okay, Kevin. - No, I'm serious, Lawrence, and I'd really appreciate it if you'd stop belittling my grieving process. It hurts my feelings. - Yeah, you're right. I shouldn't do that. I'm sorry. - Oh my God, you're the biggest gaping vagina sometimes. I'm just messing with you. Lawrence, come here. You're never gonna believe this. - I'm not doing this, Kevin. - It'll be worth it, I swear. - Kevin, I'm not doing this. - Don't be such a fucking baby, and come over here. (gentle music) We been walking for hours, trying to get our car. - [Samantha] Hey Lawrence. - [Lawrence] Hey. - He has no idea who you are. - No, he doesn't. - [Lawrence] Yeah, no, I do, I do. - Okay, who is she then? I'll give you a clue, dumb ass. You went to prom with her sister. - That's right. Oh my gosh, so great to see you. - Still, no clue. - I'm Samantha Zubec. I go by Sam. - [Lawrence] Oh hey. Yeah, Sam, I remember. Wow, it's been a while. - Yeah, like 12 years. - Has it been that long? - Yeah, yeah it has. - [Lawrence] Yeah. - So, Kevin tells me you guys need a ride. - Yeah, I mean only if it's okay. It's not, you know, no pressure. - It's fine. Are you okay with a bunch of child murderers and rapists? I'm kidding. It's minimum security. They'll embezzle you to death, maybe. Hop on. I'll take you on our way to yoga. - [Kevin] Great. - Hey, pretty teeth. I like that tie. - Thank you. - Oh, you're welcome. (gentle music) - So, Kevin tells me you guys are here burying your Dad. - Yeah, that's the idea. So far it's just been an attempt. - This might sound like a dumb question, but where is he? - He's in the back of my rental car. - Like a weekend at Bernie's style thing, or... - No, no. He's in an urn. - Otherwise he would have been much harder to steal. - It's a long story. So what brought you to Elijah's funeral? - Oh, my daughter Sarah and I were down there to visit her Dad. - She had a kid with that mongoloid retard, Nelly. - Ah, he doesn't go by Nelly anymore. - Yeah, but he's still a mongoloid retard. I mean... - Okay, one more time and then it's off my bus. All right, sound good? Anyways, Elijah and my Dad were good poker buddies, so I thought I would pay my respects. - That's cool. So, how is... - Tanya? - [Samantha] Tanya. - Tanya. - She's good, she's Mormon now, she lives in Utah, has 10 beautiful kids running around, but you're married, right, or were married, or... - Yeah, to a bunch of dicks. (gentle music) - Hey, so I never had sex with a prison guard before, so we should totally hang next time you're in town. - Sure, just get another DUI Kevin. - Okay, so I'll take that as a maybe? - Get off the bus. - Are you sure? - Get off the bus, Kevin. - Okay, thanks for the ride. - Get off the bus. Pull up your pants, put on some deodorant, get off the bus. Read a book. - Okay. - I'll give you my number, Lawrence. - [Lawrence] Oh. - But I'm not easy. - Yeah I know, terrific. - Good. - Praise baby Jesus. - Let's not celebrate just yet. Of course. - Wow. - Don't touch it, it's not... - I bet this belonged to some little girl, and he murdered her whole family. - Yeah, that's... - Serial kill much? - Well, it just looks like we're not the only ones to have that sign gag pulled on us. - Yeah, I'll bet there's a whole bunch of 'em chopped up in barrels back there somewhere. - That's really terrible, Kevin. - Well, it depends. I mean, some of 'em could have been bleeding heart liberals and democrats. He could have been doin' the world a huge favor. - [Man] Can I help you? - [Lawrence] Yeah, we're here for a car. - Yeah, well, which one? - [Kevin] It's real small and faggy. - [Lawrence] It's the rental car outside. - Yep. I'll get the paperwork. - Also, there was something in the back seat, it's not there anymore. An urn. - What'd you say it was? - An urn. It holds dead people's ashes. - [Man] I know what it is. Who was in it? - [Lawrence] Our father. - Yeah, and we're gonna bury him, and I'm an Aries, and this is my Taurus, gay half brother Lawrence who likes truckers. Is anything else you need to know while we're at it? - No. No, that's plenty, but man, if I was your father, I wouldn't wanna be buried like this. - Yeah, well, you're not, so, you know. - Gettin' carried around in some tiny, un American rental car lost by his two rude sons. Kind of a bad omen. - He's dead. He doesn't know the goddamn difference. - You know, the more I think about it, the more it seems like a sign. A bad sign. - You mean like that sign that was in the bushes? That some guy threw in there, probably a guy who owns a tow yard, who stands to profit from such things. - I don't like what you're implyin'. - [Lawrence] Please excuse my half brother. He just got off a short prison bus. - That was a good one. - Thanks. - Well, fellas, usually it's 150, but for your guys, I'm gonna make an exception. - Well, halle-fucking-lujah. - 250, for puttin' up with this guy's BS. - This is extortion. - That's the price. - But surely there's gotta be something we can do. - Yeah, you can reach into those fancy pants of yours and pull out your check book. - Goddamn fascist, I'm telling you, Lawrence. - Okay, well, the spot was not clearly marked. - It was a sign. - Which was thrown in the bushes, and we both know it. So how about 100 with the urn? - 200, and a hern. - Do not give this man one penny, Lawrence. This is a rip off. - 125 with the urn, and my number. - Sold. - What? Are you serious? - I don't know how you deal with one's homophobia. - You are welcome, by the way. - For what? - For paying your half of Dad's ransom. - You know you don't always have to rub your money in my face, right? - Kevin, I paid for everything so far, including Dad's funeral. - Yeah, well, consider it a disappointment tax. - What'd you say? - You heard me. (gentle music) Do I look all right? (gentle music) - Hey, take that. (car horn beeping) Where are you goin'? (bell dinging) - Can I help you? - Yes, we'd like to bury our father. - Dear old Dad. He killed himself. - Do you have an appointment? - No, we do not. - Do you have a plot? - [Lawrence] Yes, next to... - My mother, Summer Shaw. She didn't kill herself though. - Could you please stop saying that. We don't know that for sure. - The hell we don't. - Do you have a plot number? - You know, we don't... Do we have a plot number? - How the hell should I know? - You know, we don't have that offhand, but maybe if you looked it up in your files, we could get the paperwork started. - You wanted to do this all today. - Yeah, that's the idea, lady. (laughing) - You can't just show up without an appointment or a plot number and expect to bury someone the same day. We'd need at least three days notice to have someone here to dig the grave. - Oh, well, Kevin here is very adept shoveler and he's used to hard labor. He's a ranch hand. - Ranch manager. Was. - Whatever. - Well, it does need to be a cemetery employee. - Ma'am, we're really in a bind here. We really do need to get our father buried today. - His name is, was, Elijah. - [Lawrence] Is there anything you could do to help? - Please. - Well, let me see if there's something that I can do. - We really appreciate it. - Thank you. Thank you very much. - Ooh, looks like you guys are in a little bit of luck. We had a cancellation tomorrow. - Not tomorrow, today. - No no, please, continue. - As I was saying, we had a cancellation tomorrow, so if you show up at eight o'clock sharp, we'll get goin'. - No, no no no. We need today. Let me see that. - What do you think you're doing? - Kevin, what the hell are you doing? - What the hell does it look like? I'm helping her out. Two sets of eyes are always better than one. - Have you gone completely insane? Give it back to her this minute. - No, I wanna see if there's an appointment that we could get today that she's not telling us about. I want to bury Dad today! - Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, let go, let... I am so sorry about that, I... - You need to learn some manners, young man. - [Lawrence] He has not been the same since our father died. - That is not true, I am exactly the same. - There's no excuse for this kind of behavior. You can't just be grabbing things whenever you want. - [Lawrence] You're absolutely, he's sorry. You're sorry, aren't you, Kevin? - Oh yeah, yeah, I'm real sorry, Lawrence. - I should hope so. - Oh yeah. - I do, yeah. - Okay, great. So, eight o'clock bright and early. See you then. - Well, I'm not sure that appointment's still available at this point. - Thank you so much, thank you. - Don't touch anything in my office. Thank you. Goodbye. - I swear to God, Kevin. I am this close to running you over with my faggy little car. That woman was trying to help us. - Yeah, eight in the goddamn morning tomorrow. We should just sneak back there and bury him right now, Lawrence. There can't be that many empty plots with a Summer Shaw next to 'em. - Are you seriously proposing that? - Yes, hell yes. We go back there, find a shovel, dig a hole, throw his ass in there, throw some dirt on there, and get the heck out of here. - And you don't think there needs to be some sort of legal documents, like a lawyer, to prove all this? - How the shell should I know? I'm not some shyster lawyer. - Exactly. This isn't some ranch where you can just prance around and do whatever you want. This is the real world where people are held accountable for their actions. - That's great. I finally open up to you about how I ran over my boss' dog Reginald, and this is how you use it against me? At a time like this? This is a low blow, Lawrence, even for you. - What are you talking about? - Can you take Dad? Can I see the keys for a second? Just the keys, let me see 'em. - Nice, that was real mature. - Enjoy your safari, Lawrence. ♪ La, la la la la, la la la la ♪ La, la la la la, la la la la ♪ La, la la la la, la la la la ♪ La, la la la la, la la la la ♪ La, la la - Fuck!

Do you understand? - What the hell is all over your face? - What do you think? - No way. - Get in the car! In. I'll be in the shower. - So what, should I just get ice or somethin'? (gentle music) (gentle music) (phone vibrating) - [Lawrence] Hello? - [Kevin] Lawrence, it's Kevin. Did I catch you in the middle of some gay sex or something? - Where are you? - [Kevin] I've been down at Silver Dollars, this great little hole in the wall. I mean, not the kind you're used to, but... - What do you want, Kevin? - [Kevin] I want you to get your girl ass down here and have some dinner with me, brother. - I don't think so. - [Kevin] Oh, come on. Be good old fashioned, Shaw brother bonding. And Jeanette just got here. I'm about to go over there and lay me some pipe, partner. - All right, well, I've had enough brother bonding for one day. - [Kevin] What? - I said I'm good. - [Kevin] What? - I said I'm good, I'm gonna call it a night. - [Kevin] Where are you? It sounds like you're underwater. - I'm in the motel room, where do you think? - [Kevin] Listen, I don't wanna walk in on you jerkin' off later, okay? - Well, you can't, you don't have a key. - [Kevin] Well, that's what I'm saying. Just leave one outside for me, under a rock or something. - There aren't any rocks, Kevin. - [Kevin] Leave it under a mat then. - There's no mat either. - [Kevin] Look, I don't wanna argue with you, Lawrence. Just leave them under some goddamn thing, okay. (phone beeping) - Hello, Kevin. (moaning) (gentle music) Hi Sam. It's Lawrence. Lawrence Shaw from the short bus, the short prison bus. Anyway, I wanted to know if maybe you wanted to come to dinner tonight. I'm gonna go have some dinner, and maybe you wanted to have some dinner with me. If not, that's cool, but you can, and you can give me a call at... Well, the number should be on your phone, that's my number. So, Lawrence Shaw, again, and anyway, yeah, so, I hope you're great. Bye. - [Clerk] Hello? - [Kevin] Oh hi, I'm staying in room 113. - [Clerk] What can I do for ya? - [Kevin] I was hoping you could tell me where I... - [Clerk] Titty bar? - [Kevin] No. - [Clerk] Cat house. - [Kevin] No, I just... - [Clerk] Drugs. - [Kevin] No, I just... - [Clerk] Well, what the hell you want then? - [Kevin] Can you tell me a place to eat? - [Clerk] Well, why the heck didn't you just say so? - Well, you're not exactly the... - [Clerk] Yeah, yeah, three blocks out past by the titty bar, hang a left at the cat house, see it up there on the right by the drug dealers. And buddy, yeah, that's you, I'm talkin' to you, buddy. - Oh, yeah. - [Clerk] Make sure you get them dirty whores out of the room by the morning. This here's a family establishment. - I'll be sure to do that. (phone vibrating) Hello? - [Samantha] I didn't have time to go home and change, so... - Oh, that's okay. I kind of like your prison outfit. - Oh. Thank you. Uniform. - Uniform. - You know, when I give guys my number I usually don't see or hear from them again, so... - What, like they don't call you back? - No, well, I mean, depending on how the first date goes, I usually bump 'em off, or bury them alive, or use them for target practice. - Damn, I knew I should have worn my vest. - I'm more of a headshot gal myself, so... - I see. - [Samantha] Nice shirt. - Thanks, it kind of howled at me. - What did it howl? I was a bad idea in the '80s and now, but where me anyways? - Well, actually, it was the only clean t-shirt I had. - [Samantha] Oh, you tried. - Yeah, to not get my father's ashes on you. - What? - Hi, how many? - Two, I think. - Yeah, Kevin's not coming, right? - Oh, no no. God no. He's probably off doing something. - [Samantha] Or someone. - [Lawrence] Yeah. - [Lawrence] Sorry. - No, no, that's okay. Are you guys on a first date or something? - [Lawrence] No, we're old friends. - Yeah, exactly. Wow, gross. (laughs) - I don't know, you don't really strike me as the prison bus driving type. - Oh yeah? I'll take that as a compliment? - I meant it as a compliment. I mean, I was trying to... - I'm kidding. Of course I took it as a compliment. Relax. Jesus, Lawrence. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Yeah, I drive the bus so I can go to school part time, and it gives me benefits, which when you kid's father's an oxygen thief, it really comes in handy. - [Lawrence] Well, how old's your daughter? - [Samantha] Sarah's four. - And where is she? - She's with the sitter. I don't usually bring her on dates. She kind of cramps my style. So tell me about you. I haven't heard about you in forever. - Let's see. Well, I live in Portland, I work for an ad agency, and we mainly do beer campaigns. - Oh, that sounds exciting. - It's really not. We specialize in marketing too. Well, to Kevin, really. It's pretty stupid. - It'd have to be. - Yep, hairy guys in trucker hats. I just shut my brain off and imagine that I'm Kevin. - Impressive. Exploiting and impersonating your brother for money. I like it. - Thank you. - You just don't strike me as the exploiting and impersonating somebody for money type. - Well, someone's gotta do it. I mean, how else are these guys with mullets gonna know what beer to drink? - I'd just still rather drive a prison bus. - [Lawrence] Short bus at that. - Okay, all right, yeah, short bus. There's nothing wrong with that. - I think it's a great job. - [Samantha] Why? - 'Cause you do it. - That's really sweet. That has gotta be the smallest rental car I have ever seen. - It was definitely the cheapest, and they only had yellow, so... - Listen, I like you Lawrence. I mean, even if you do encourage gun toting hicks to drink more beer, and thus more rapings in the world, but... - Rapings? Jesus. - Yeah, no, I mean statistically I bet there's a write up on it that we could read somewhere. - Yeah, no, I get it. I just never really thought about that. - I have a lot of time to think while driving. - Well, thankfully I contribute more than just sexual battery statistics to the world. - Well, like what? Bad men? - Yeah, I've done that sometimes. (gentle music) No. No, I can't, I can't. - [Samantha] No what? - [Lawrence] I can't, I'm sorry. - [Samantha] What's wrong? - I... - What happened? - This has been really nice. - Yeah, agreed. It has been nice. - It's kind of also, it's not nice. Okay, well, first off, you're geographically undesirable. - Oh, come on. - You come on. Because you're like seven area codes away, and you're seven area codes away. - Yeah, okay, sure. - And you've got a daughter, and probably like a mortgage or something. You, this is your home. I'm just passing through. I'm a lone wolf, you know? - Okay, even if I don't see you again. I mean, who cares? - Yeah, and I'm gay, so... You didn't know that? - No. I did, I did. I knew. - [Lawrence] You knew that? - Yes, and then there wasn't any question about it. Kevin's comment about married to a bunch of dicks kind of cleared it up. So, I was like... But you seemed so into it, and you were into it, so I went for it. - Okay, you're right. No, I was, and I'm sorry, but I feel like maybe it was the prison guard uniform. - Like a man in uniform type of deal? - I'm sorry, yeah. - Do you want me to go? (gentle music) ♪ La, la la la la, la la la la ♪ La la la la, la, la ♪ La, la la la la, la la la, la, la ♪ La, la la la la - Goodnight. ♪ La, la la la la ♪ La, la la la la, la la la la ♪ La la la la, la la ♪ La, la la la (moaning) - [Kevin] So fuckin' hot. - Are you kidding me? - What the hell, man? - This is beyond words, Kevin. - What are you doin'? Turn off the light. My brother's become a stick in the mud. - [Woman] He can watch if he wants to. - You wanna watch, Lawrence? - I don't wanna watch! - [Woman] Oh, c'mere. - Wait a second. Hold on. - [Woman] What? - Is that a dick? Oh God. Ugh. Oh my God. Remind me never to challenge... - Challenge a tranny to a fight outside her motel room at 4:00 a.m., getting us kicked out? - Yeah. - Or challenge a tranny named after a Japanese sport's car. - [Kevin] Yes, that too. - How the hell did you not know this person was a tranny? - I don't know. I was drunk, and I was having a great time, and then I blacked out, and when I woke up I was inside her, him, it. - Inside the tranny named Lexis. - Can you please just stop saying the word tranny? Jesus Christ. My God, Lawrence. I'm gay. I'm gay. - No, no you're not. - [Kevin] No, I am. - No. - I had sex with a tranny, and it beat me up. - You're not gay, Kevin, you're an idiot. That's what you are. - I had sex with something that had a penis, Lawrence. Wait, is this how you turned gay? - What? No no no, no. Do not denigrate my sexual identity because of your alcoholic, moronic, sexual misgivings. Do you understand me? Do you understand? That's offensive! - I thought at the least I would get a little sympathy from my gay half brother. Now that we play for the same team. I mean, come on. - I'm not falling for this trick again, okay. It's not gonna work. - This isn't a trick, Lawrence. I finally understand what you went through all those years. - Just please stop. - Lawrence, I'm saying I accept you in all of your full fledged and flamboyant gayness. - Shut the fuck up, Kevin. Okay? Just stop. I'm gonna go wash my hands because I don't know what diseases that Lexis had on it. FYI, you should get an AIDS test when we get back. - Now that we're in the same boat, maybe we should get tested together. - Please, just stop. - Is everything okay? Jesus, what happened to your face? - Don't even start with me, Jeanette. I'm not interested. - What are you talking about? - Just take my number, rip it up. I'm a homosexual now. Just, just, just... I'm officially off the market. - Do you want something else to drink? - I really do. I'm really thirsty, but I don't know what my people drink. - Well, your brother likes green tea. - Okay, I may be gay, but I'm not a pussy, all right. - Come on, it has a lot of antioxidants in it. You'll like it, you should really try it. - Really? - [Jeanette] Yes. - I guess I am gonna be trying a lot more new stuff now that I'm gay. Maybe I should start with green tea. - Do you want some ice for your face? - Do you think it would be all right? - Yes, Kevin, gay people can use ice too. - Yes, there are pictures on my Facebook page. It's a Facebook page. Yeah, well there are gonna be pictures of my boyfriend, my ex boyfriend on there. They do know that gay people drink beer as well, right? There has to be something I can do. Is there anything I can do? Okay. Okay. I'm sorry, Martin. Okay, bye. (grunting) Damn. I don't wanna hear it. - [Lexi] That's him right there, baby. - [Man] That's him, this Larry the cable guy lookin' motherfucker? - [Lexi] Mm-hmm, that's the one. - Hold on, hold on. Say, deliverance, I wanna talk to you man. - Yeah, where you runnin' off to so fast? - I just gotta go inside and pay my bill real fast. - Funny, that's why we're here. So you can pay your bill. - You think you can just get all this and not even pay up. - Look, look, I can explain. I can. - [Lexis] This should be good. - Yeah, I wanna hear this white bread. Go ahead. - Look Lexis, about earlier, I'm really sorry. I'm so sorry about that. - You think that just makes it better then? - Oh, no no. What I'm saying is, is I'm gay now too, I think, and I totally, you know, like get your struggle. - That practically makes us brother and sister then, doesn't it? - [Kevin] That's exactly what I'm sayin'. Ow. - Man, could you just shut your ignorant ass up and pay up before we both kick your ass. - I am not done with you. - Have you seen my brother Kevin? - I'm sorry? - My idiot half brother. Where is he? - Oh, I think he just stepped outside for a smoke. - [Man] Yeah, hillbilly cracker ass cracker. - [Jeanette] Is everything okay with you guys? - No, not even a little bit. Do me a favor, call the cops. - [Jeanette] What? - Just call the police, thank you. I appreciate it. - Nobody talks to my lady like that. - She's not a lady, but it's okay. - Shut your inbred mouth, bitch. - Banjo playin', hillbilly ass cracker. - I don't play the banjo. - Oh, don't stop on my account. You're doin' a fantastic job. - That's his brother, baby. - What, you want some of this? - [Kevin] Help me Lawrence, help. - I'd like to remain an observer, if that's okay. - I just want my money. - Yeah, we want some money. - Don't do it, Lawrence. It's a scam. It's a bait and switch. - Bait? You knew exactly what you was gettin' into. - I did not. - Yeah, the only scam here is you trying to get the milk without paying for the cow. - [Kevin] I don't like cow. - Look, Lexis, is it? - Yes, that's my name. - I like it. It's classy, like the car. - Yeah, my lady's a classy lady. - So how much does my half brother owe you? - 200 dollars. - Plus a little extra. I broke some nails when I was fighting him. - Yeah, yeah. - I'll pay you that amount that you're owed, and a hefty bonus. - [Kevin] Thank you, Lawrence. - If you finish the job. By that, I mean, kick the living daylights out of him. - What? What are you talking about? - We got this. - You can't do this to me. This is a hate crime. You are a traitor and a Judas, Lawrence. - Okay, Kevin. - No, I'm serious. I mean, what kind of man let's his own half brother get gay bashed? - You're not gay, and the only reason you got bashed is 'cause you're an idiot, and you lie a reckless lifestyle. - Yeah, you're one to talk. What, with all your broke back canyon sex that you're havin'. - It's mountain, and I use protection, so, doesn't work. - All right. So let me get this straight. All this is from a fight with a transsexual prostitute? - Two, actually. - [Officer] Two transsexual prostitutes. - No, no. Fights. I only had sex with one of 'em. - What my brother's trying to say is he had sex with one individual who he claims he didn't know was a transsexual prostitute. - At the time I thought she might be my soul mate or somethin'. - Anyway, this transsexual prostitute beat him up once by his or herself, and then again with his or her pimp and/or boyfriend. - That's correct. His or her name was Lexis, and these were and are hate crimes. - I see. Lexis. Classy name, like the car. - [Lawrence] Yeah, she was really classy. - He/she was pretty classy when I first ran into her. Him/her at the silver dollar bar. - Thursday night's are transgender night at the Silver Dollar. You boys obviously didn't realize that. Now, why do you believe these were, are hate crimes? - 'Cause at the time I was gay. - [Officer] At the time? - Yeah, but I really do think it was more of a temporary gayness though, like a temporary insanity or somethin'. - I see. Well, we can't find this Lexis, or his/her pimp, so we're gonna go ahead and put that one on the back burner for now. - I think you're makin' a real big mistake here, sir, and I think this could lead to far more victims such as myself. - Victims of what? Temporary gay passion? - [Lawrence] That's a good one. - Let's talk about the ashes, shall we? Your mother's really angry with you boys. Sheriff MacDonald's none too thrilled either. - [Lawrence] We're really sorry about that, sir. - No, we're not. Our backs were up against the wall. - What my brother's trying to say is that we let the situation get the better of us. - No, screw that. We were gonna lose the house. - Kevin, yeah, I know. - We were gonna lose everything, Lawrence. We had no choice. We had to do it, just tell him the truth. - All right, all right, settle down, both of you, or we're gonna have a problem here. What I was gonna say was, lucky for you, your mother has decided not to press charges. Clifton Geddes won't as well. He's the funeral home proprietor. - [Kevin] Coincidentally. - [Lawrence] Yeah, magically. - Now, as far as the transsexual prostitute fighting's concerned, looks like you pretty much got your ass handed to you on a plate. So, you're free to go. But please, no more trouble while you're here. - Thank you, Detective. Kevin, thank him. - Why? He's makin' fun of me? - [Lawrence] Because he's letting us go and he doesn't have to. - Fine. Thank you. But just so you know, he/she, her/him, could really fight. I mean, like, cage match, muay thai, like just fuckin' animal. - Sure, he/she could, son. - All right. Come on, grab Dad, let's go. - Stop telling me what to do, Lawrence. - I'm not telling, I'm asking. - Sounds a lot like telling, and like you gargled 12 gallon of semen last night. What the hell happened to your voice? - Well, I'm stressed, and my voice... Can you please grab our dearly departed father's urn from the backseat, so that we are not late for his hopefully amazing burial. Please, thank you, sir, brother, just please. - Fine. I mean, all those times you gave me crap about accepting you. Now I finally have my own gay moment, and who discriminates against me? My own gay half brother. - There's nothing to discriminate against, Kevin, other than your stupidity. (woman clearing throat) - Is that your father? - Dear old Dad. - Rusty, these are the ones I was telling you about. - You two. - [Shaw Brothers] We don't wanna hear it. - [Kevin] Yeah, but you paid sexual derelicts to rough me up, Lawrence. - [Lawrence] What the hell did you expect? - [Kevin] Well, I didn't expect you to take out all your gay rage on me, that's for sure. - Well, you deserved it, and I would do it again, except with more bashing and different kinds. - Such a faggot sometimes. - What'd you call me? - I called you a faggot. What are you gonna do about it? Hit me? It's not like this trip could be any worse. I mean, Dad killed himself, and we're probably gonna lose the house because of it, which means this whole trip was for nothing. We discovered a necrophiliac who most likely had sex with his body. You hit me with a car. Oh, and before I forget, I also had sex with a tranny named Lexis, who beat me up twice, and probably gave me AIDS. So, go ahead Lawrence. Give it your best shot. - No, you're right. This day couldn't get any worse, but you left out some things. Like, how about you drugging my mother? Or, throwing my keys in the bushes? Like, me spilling Elijah's urn all over my rental car, and filling the rest up with dirt? Like, me trying to sleep with a woman because I can't accept that I am gay. Like me losing the biggest account of my life because they found out that I was gay, like me going back to Portland with no job most likely, because I lost the biggest account of my life, because they found out I was gay. No, you're right. This day possibly couldn't get any worse. - Did you get your dick wet with Sam? - No. - Gentleman, if I may, I've got other graves to dig here, so if you wanna say something. - I mean, I don't know what the hell for. He already had a funeral, right. Go ahead. - [Rusty] All right. - No no, wait. Can you just wait a second. - Yeah, I can wait. - Thank you. I really don't know what to say, but I do forgive you, Elijah, even though you called me a faggot most of my life and never accepted me. I forgive you. I wish we could have had a man to man talk before you drove your stupidly expensive, over compensating, all American truck into a tree, because you're too homophobic to get a prostate exam. Maybe you're just too afraid to admit defeat, or maybe you were just plain too drunk to drive either way. I want you to know that Kevin and I did this not for you, but on own accord in spite of you, because, let's face it, we both know how little you thought of us. You probably thought we'd screw this up, but we didn't. So... I hope this plot of land suits you for your eternal resting place. Farewell. Happy travels. - That was really nice, Lawrence. - Thank you. And I will take you up on your offer. - What? Oh God, Jesus. You just hit me in the neck. What the hell was that? - I don't know, I've never been in a fight before. - You hit like such a faggot. At least give me some warning. - I told you not to call me that anymore. I'm sick of it. You don't accept me, Dad never accepted me, my work doesn't accept me. My own boyfriend doesn't accept me. I'm tired of it. - Now, what the hell was that for? - [Lawrence] I don't know, emphasis. - You didn't have to do that. He's just trying to help us. - You people. You wanna act that way, you can bury your own dog gone father. - We're sorry, Rusty. It's all right, buddy. See you in hell, you old bastard. Sorry Mom. - Don't even start. That's great news, Tom. Thank you, I appreciate it. Okay, bye. Kevin. Kevin. - [Kevin] What? - That was Tom. Investigation's over. They're calling it an accident. - Great, let's all have a circle jerk about it. (gentle music) - [Elijah] To my dearest June, and my two sons, Kevin and Lawrence Shaw. I went to the doctor again today, and it seems it's official. They've given me eight to 12 weeks to live. Now, at this point, I feel I'm faced with a choice. Upon finding this note, you'll understand that I have made it. Rather than withering away like some half ass sand castle on some no good beach somewhere, just waiting for fate to deal me my hand, I have decided to do the courageous thing and go out at the top of my game. June, I want you to know that despite all our differences and all our issues, I have, and I will always love you 'til the end of time. And to my sons, Lawrence and Kevin, I know I didn't say it enough, but I'm extremely proud of you both for the men that you have become. You both have chosen your own paths in life, and I respect you for that. I love you both. Heck, I love you all. And everyone else, well, shit fuck 'em if they can't take a joke. All the best, Elijah Shaw. (gentle music) ♪ Ooh ♪ Ooh ooh ♪ Ooh ooh ♪ Ooh ♪ Ooh (upbeat music) ♪ Ooh ooh ♪ Ooh ooh ♪ Ooh ooh ♪ Ooh
