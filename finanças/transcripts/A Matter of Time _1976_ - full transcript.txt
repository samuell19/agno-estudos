(REPORTERS CLAMORING) Listen, I'll call you back. Please, please gentlemen, may I have your attention. Ladies and gentlemen, Nina will be here in 15 minutes. The first time I met her was in a restaurant. As a matter of fact, she was working as a maid in a hotel. It sounds like a publicity story, but I can assure you it is quite true. You have an exclusive contract? No, she no longer signs exclusive contracts with anyone. Almost 2:00. Will she be on time? One thing I can assure you, the young lady is a professional. (LAUGHTER) MAN: Oh, Nina, you are marvelous. Roberto, would you please take the Baron to his hotel after you drop me off? Thank you. I have the Princess Maria docked at Monte Carlo. Could you join me for a few days? Oh, darling, I'd love to, but I can't, right now, it's impossible. Oh, could you hand me the mirror? But I will see you tonight? Well, call me, we'll see. Thank you. What is the story behind that mirror? It's a long story. Someday I'll tell you. (QUACKING) Roberto, come here! What are you doing? (CLAMORING) Papa! Papa! Papa, papa! I have to go! -Come here. -Goodbye. (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) Come on. Wait till I get you home. Excuse me. Excuse me. My name is Nina. My cousin, Valentina, she works here and I thought perhaps you could tell me where I might find her. -Nina! -Valentina! -Oh, I'm so happy to see you! -Oh, I'm so happy to see you! Oh, my goodness, you look so different. I could hardly recognize you. Of course, I'm a Roman. A Roman. Oh, come on, let me help you. No, no, I can manage. I can manage. So, how was your trip? Oh, my trip was wonderful. I thought you'd never arrive. Neither did I. You talked it over with your Papa? -Yes. -And he told you to come? No, he told me not to come, but I said if my cousin Valentina can do it for three years now and earned lots of money, I'll go anyway. Good. The Hotel is a bit shabby, but it was once the most beautiful, luxurious hotel in Rome. The job is good except... Oh, God, am I happy to see you. One more week on the fifth floor and I'd be jumping out of the window. You have had experience, haven't you? Oh, yes. Last summer in Fregene. Is this safe? (VALENTINA LAUGHS) You can leave your suitcase here for a minute. This way you have all the transients, and here are the regulars. (COUGHING) This is Mr. DePerma, our traveling salesman. And there there's an American girl. She wants to be a movie star. She likes girls. Watch her. Here's the Contessa Sanziani. Valentina, a real Contessa? Yes. You'll have to be prepared for anything with her. Why? You'll see. Coming? This is the pantry. The pass-key is over here on the wall. The linen is here. There's plenty of uniforms in the bottom drawer. And this is our room. You're on the side by the window. I can't stand the morning sun. This is my side of the room. You can put your clothes in here. And we also have the bathroom. It took me eight months before I could get this place. Lucky. That's about all. Aren't you happy I wrote to you? -Aren't you glad you came? -Yes. Oh! You'll love Rome, I promise. Well, see you later. Where are you going? To the second floor. They have suites there, sitting-rooms, between bedrooms. Wish me luck. Good luck! Excuse me, signor. Listen to me, the world is a pigsty and you are nothing but a wart on a pig's behind. -I beg your pardon, signor? -No, no, no, no. Excuse me, signor. No, no, no. That's not good. The world... The world is a latrine and you are nothing but a flyspeck on the filthy wall. Can I make up your bed? (SIGHS) I am Nina, I am the new maid, and I was just wondering if you'd like me to... The world, my friend, is a piss pot, and you... I won't be a minute. Okay, okay, get on with it. -But don't you make a sound, understand? -Yes. -(TYPEWRITER CLACKING) -The world... What are you doing there? Nothing, I was... Put them down, down. Don't you ever touch my work, ever. Yes, signor. I was only, I was only picking them up because I wanted to do the bed, but now that I know not to touch them, I... You disturbed me. Oh? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm leaving. (DOOR SLAMS) Goodbye. I would like those tuberoses in the window, please. -How many, signora? -All of them. To be delivered to La Contessa Sanziani, Imperial Hotel. Yes, and if I may ask, what about the bill? The porter will pay you of course. Excuse me, Signora Contessa? (HUMMING) Yes. I'm prepared to offer you 60,000 lire. Is that satisfactory? Quite. Here you are, Signora Contessa. And should you have any other jewelry to sell, I'm always at your disposal. No, it's finished. There's nothing more. Nothing more. (HUMMING) "Reproduction of painting of Contessa Sanziani, "by Boldini." Klimt. Van Dongen. Zuloaga. Boldini. Bakst. (ELEVATOR DOOR CLOSES) (HUMMING) My key, Aldo. One moment, please. I'm expecting some flowers. You'll settle the bill, please, when they arrive? In that case, Signora Contessa, you'll have to give me the money. Put it on my bill, as usual, Aldo. I cannot do that, and please, I am not Aldo, I am Renato. Where's Aldo? He died. Ten years ago. Don't try to be funny. Signora Contessa. If you please, signora. It is necessary, you see, for us to have some money immediately. We cannot wait any longer, Signora. Eleven weeks you owe us to occupy a room. The room must be paid for. Of course I'll pay. What do you mean by pointing your finger that way and shouting at me? Really, most impolite. There! Signora Contessa. If you please, signora. Please try to understand, you see, I am responsible. There are spots on your tie and I'll wager your haven't pressed that suit in a month. Signora, please. Signora. From the 17th to the 21st? Oh, no, no, that's quite impossible. I wish to see the Countess Sanziani. I'll call you back. May I ask who is calling? Her husband. Count Sanziani. Oh, oh, yes, indeed, sir. The Contessa is on the fifth floor. Room 57. Allow me, please, to escort you. Please. Our service here isn't all that it used to be, of course. Still, we try to do all we can for the Contessa. Sometimes she forgets to close it. Signora Contessa? I believe she's on the balcony. Thank you. You can go now. Oh. Of course. Lucrexia? Of course. I knew you'd come. Someone told me at the club, I forget who it was, that you were staying here. That you were not well or very happy. Oh, I know, 40 years ago I swore never to see you again. But now, now that we have lived so long... I was expecting you. Well, well I must say I find that surprising, but then your reactions always surprised me. There is nothing you can say that's going to alter anything. Nothing. I will not come back to live with you. Naturally. There can be no question of that. I only came here because... It's d'Orazio, of course. It's no secret, I intend to live with him. D'Orazio? You, you mean he's still alive? Oh, I thought he was dead. But then I live so quietly, in the country, you see. So, that still goes on. It must indeed, have been a great love. My only true love. It's d'Orazio who keeps me alive. Well, surely he could find you a better place to live. Money means nothing to me. It never has. But you insist upon treating me as if I was an irresponsible child. Indeed, you take far greater interest in your horses. I have no horses anymore. When I tell you that I am miserable, you take me to the theatre. When I tell you that I intend to be unfaithful, you stroke my cheek and smile. Never a moment of passion, never... Never an outburst of jealousy. All the same, I never forgave you for betraying me with a man older than myself. For walking out of our life when... Oh, God, this is impossible. Here we are still quarrelling when it's all so unimportant anymore. Oh, I thank God for Gabriel d'Orazio. He's given me strength. He's given me life. He's unveiled the sun to me. And when we make love, it's never dark, but it is open and free to the sound of the sea and the wind. Really, Lucrexia, how can you speak of such things now? Because I'm alive. I'm alive. Very well, I'm delighted he's made your life so beautiful. I wish that I could have inspired a feeling so great and so lasting. But you needn't worry. I'm well over it. I just never believed that I could find you so, so little changed inside. Age has taught you nothing. Well, perhaps, for you, it's marvelous after all. I do hope everything was satisfactory, sir. The Contessa must have been so happy to see you. If anything should happen I do not wish to be informed. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Excuse me, my name is Nina. I am the new maid. Would you like me to turn your bed down? My poor Carlotta. I shall have to part with you. I shan't be able to pay you any longer. Oh, no, it's all right, the hotel pays me, Signora Contessa. At the sunset hour... What? These starlings fly over Rome. Thousands of them. It is one of the mysteries of nature. And did you know the noise of the rain so often heard in the music of Berlioz. That's the chirping of these little birds, these starlings. You're pretty. Oh, no, signora. I know what I'm saying, yes, pretty. How old are you? I'm 19. Oh, I should like that, to be 19 again and in your place. In my place. You mean, making up beds? You're only what you wish to be. But you must take the risk. Never turn away from either joy or suffering. Take it all. Take everything you can from life. It never gives anything back. Tell me, do you have a lover yet? Well, there's Gino. Gino. He's a chemist. He is from Milan. Well, actually, he's not really a chemist yet. He is an apprentice to one. I met him last summer in a resort and we seemed to get along very well. But he hasn't written to me since then. Forget him. You think so? He has forgotten you already. Do you really want to be the wife of a chemist? I never thought about it. A chemist shop, a chemist house, chemist children. (CHUCKLES) Is this really your dream? I don't know. Here. I want you to look at yourself. Yes, go on and look at yourself in this mirror and try to understand. Signora, I don't... Do as I say. It isn't enough to look at oneself. The mirror must be beautiful, too. The mirror? Yes, the two, you and the mirror. If only. What? Oh, that. Not even a beautiful mirror can take away an ugly birthmark. You have my sacred promise, one day there will be men, important men who will go to their damnation for the sake of pressing their lips to it. Jeremiah. Sit down, sit down. You look terrible, my friend, eh, what's the matter? It's the rape scene. I can't get it right. Mario, the rape is the very nucleus of the picture and you must take your time with it. You understand? Let me introduce you to Vasco Politi. Hi. A gentleman of the press. Watch out, he puts everything you say down on paper. Who is that woman? VICARI: You've never seen the Contessa Sanziani? That old woman, my young friend, was, by any definition the greatest love goddess in all Europe. The absolute ravishing masterpiece of a feminine animal. The inspiration to countless artists of renown, not to mention, of course, her many lovers, including the Kaiser Leopoldo and Gabriel d'Orazio. Hmm. As a matter of fact, she lives in my hotel. She must be a gold mine of memories. I can tell you, she gave me my start. She started this place years ago. She stopped outside one day in a huge car, yellow as the sun, then she came in dragged by these greyhounds along with some very thin gentleman. Later on I found out he was an Egyptian prince. She asked me what my specialty was, and I said, "beans cooked in oil." She burst out laughing and told me to roast a pheasant. I did, and from then on she kept coming and brought all of Rome. If you gentlemen will please excuse me. Yes, yes. -One of her greyhounds... -What, what, what, what? One of her greyhounds was called Falstaff and he was taller than the table. Would you forgive me, Contessa. I'm a reporter for Figaro and I would like to interview you. Hmm, nice looking. Thank you. As I understand it, you knew Kaiser Wilhelm and Gabriel D'Orazio. Could you perhaps tell me something about your life at that time. My life belongs to me alone. I tell it only to myself. Have you thought, however, of writing your memoir, of all that you've seen, Contessa? It isn't what I've seen that matters. My life has not been that of a spectator. Oh, yes, I don't doubt it, but then you need speak only of those who are dead. No one is dead. No one dies unless we wish them to. That is the secret that I will share with you. You see, time, you see, doesn't exist. It is terrible I admit, not to be able to suffer anymore, the suffering of others. I would so passionately like to but it's impossible for me any longer. That is the meaning of solitude. Any further questions then, you may come to my house tomorrow. Hamilton House at Hyde Park corner. Contessa. Of course, Mario, in the final scene we must feel the underlying tragedy. Well. What did she say? I'm not sure. What do you mean? Either she's completely mad, or she made a complete fool of me. It's exasperating not to know which. Are you coming out with me tonight? Sometimes two can make out better than one. Oh, I forgot, I have some more beds to turn down. I'll never get to the park on time. Oh. (BIRDS TWITTERING) Jeanne! Jeanne! Oh! Jeanne! Signora? Oh, there you are, Jeanne, what time is it? Oh, well, it's about 6:00. Oh, it seems so late already. Well, never mind. He'll just have to wait for us. Oh, they always do, you know, and it is quite right, you see, that important men should wait. It gives them the illusion that there is still something worth waiting for. I want you to be very beautiful this evening and very strange. Oh, in that cupboard, on the shelf. Yes, in there, on the left, bring me the sari. The sari. Yes, have you found it? Ah, yes, I have it right here. But you haven't got a thing. I told you to look on the left. But there's only a cardboard... Yes, yes, go on. Is this it? Yes, thank you, my dear. Oh, this was given to me by an Indian Ambassador. I've only worn it once. (GASPS) Oh, signora! Oh! It's like a sunset. Yes, indeed. Oh, take off that shabby dress. It makes you look like a servant. Go on, take it off. Oh, Jeanne, do as I tell you or I shan't bother with you anymore! Don't be afraid of showing yourself naked. Modesty is only a sense of imperfection. A virtue taught by ugly women. One gets rid of it directly, one knows one is beautiful. Be proud of your belly. Be proud of your breasts. Be proud of your skin. Never deny these precious gifts. It's an insult to God. Oh, signora! If only I could be like you. Oh, never, never. You must never wish to be like anyone else in this world. Unless you want to be a copy. Copies, of course, yes, they only produce mediocrity. Now, come and sit down here. If you are not an original, you are nothing. The world, you see, worships the original. Oh, your hair. Oh! I'm afraid I must cut it. Oh, no, signora! Don't worry, I shan't hurt you. And you will look wonderful. There. There. It's your turn, little one, to be desired and to conquer. Tonight I choose between hating you and directing your steps. Now, be yourself, if you can. That is the important thing. And, if you can't, be silent. He will imagine what he wants to imagine. For this, of course, he has to pay a high price. Oh, not for the money itself, never, but for what he thinks of you. For the value he places on you. Now, tonight as you move along the hotel corridor, you will notice the jeweler's windows, and as you pass the one on the right, you will point out a large diamond necklace, open your mouth, and you will say, as a child might say, "Oh, how pretty that is." That's all. He'll understand, I promise you. Is that clear? I think so. Good. There. There. Look at yourself. Now you look as you should. You may go now. Oh, Contessa, thank you! Do not thank me. I am merely teaching myself to grow old in the right way. I wish you as much happiness, as much suffering in your life, as I have had in mine. Go along now. Oh, Contessa, your sari, I can't take your sari. I shall never wear it again. It's yours. No, I can't. I can't accept it. It's yours. I give it to you, Nina. ♪ I know, there's a me I haven't met yet ♪ In the winter night when I was small ♪ I could see a face and hear a call ♪ From the wonderful me I haven't met yet ♪ With the sweetest voice I've ever known ♪ Saying, "Come to me, myself, my own" ♪ How she'd whisper to me at night ♪ How I waited till the time was right ♪ Now I go to the me I haven't met yet ♪ Though the road is filled with turns and bends ♪ In my heart I know that when my journey ends ♪ In the best of worlds ♪ We'll be the best ♪ Of friends La-la!

To my dear Lydia. We are leaving tomorrow for... To my dear Lydia, we are leaving tomorrow for Cannes. I planned to stay on a few weeks in Venice, but I simply can't stand it here anymore. I am staying with Tewfik again. We seem to spend hours without saying a word to each other. No, not roulette, not tonight. Let's go to the Baccarat table. And so I spend my time with Tewfik, often staying up all night at the casino. Of course, Tewfik never plays. No, he watches me play, hoping I'll lose, but he always pays up. Poor Tewfik, he doesn't seem to want anything anymore. And I feel the same. No, that isn't true, I still want everything. Cruelly. But I'm approaching an age when one must pay for love, I shall never resign myself to that. Oh, dear God, it's the Marchesa de Lasante. She's my age. Is it possible? Do I look as old as that? Years ago, a fortuneteller told that there would be hardships at the end of my life. "At what age?" I asked her. "Tell me. At what age?" And she said, "At 72." Seventy! I am. I am 72. -No, no! -(SCREAMS) Signora! No, no! Where? Where? What is this place? Oh, God, where am I? (SOBBING) Oh, this wretched room, it's horrible. Oh, God, what is happening to me? Oh, help me, help me. Oh, this wretched horrible room. It's all right. I'm here, you're all right. I won't leave you. I promise you. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) MANAGER: Open up, what's going on in there? Nothing, signore, it's only a bad dream. I'll take care of her. I promise you. MANAGER: And I can promise you that she is leaving. -No, signore! -She has my word for it. Monday next. It's all right, they've gone now. It's all right, Contessa. You don't have to be afraid, you never have to be afraid, all right? Contessa? Contessa, I know I can't understand everything. I haven't got the education, but I'm learning. And... What you are and what you've lived, that's something magical, please don't give up your memories. I mean, for your sake as well as for mine. Oh, Contessa, I feel like I am a part of them now. Contessa, do you know what you have done for me? You've made me think of myself as really being someone, as really being somebody. Banco. (MAN SPEAKING ITALIAN) What? Tewfik arrested? I just lost a banco of 400,000 francs. He certainly has chosen his moment well. I believe that this should more than cover it. Oh, I almost forgot. For the staff. (KNOCKING) (HUMMING) Oh, God, you little bitch. Shut up, you slut. Don't pretend with me. You think I don't know what you want? I haven't had a woman for months. Not a sound, you bitch. Or I will kill you first, understand? You will like it, yes? Why, you'll want it as much as I do. Craving to have me next to you, your skin, your body, inside of you. By force. Abused, ravaged. I will take you. I will take you. No. It's a terrible scene. It's not there. Goddammit, it's not there. Stupid. Trite. Cliches. If only I could get it right! The right approach, something to capture them both. Something urgent. Shocking and yet, it has to be force. Ugly, cruel force. And how do you transcend that? I hate to bother you, but this is really important. -How? -I found these certificates. I got them from the Contessa's room. Company of Congo. I think it may be a goldmine company. What? Well, they're stock certificates and I thought they might be worth some money to her, you know. You see, if you could just look at them for a minute, they've all got a number. (SCOFFS) 1903. It says 1903, for Christ sake. That's 46 years ago. You mean you think the company might be gone? Gone. Dead. I don't know, maybe they could have moved. You can stuff a mattress with them. But she's got to have something to pay for her room, she needs the money. I have to find a way to help her, or they'll kick her out. Let them kick. Oh, no, you... Don't you understand? You see they might, they might just put her in an asylum, you know. Good. It's exactly where she belongs. Do you want to wake up here some morning with your throat cut, eh? Oh, the old bag is out of her mind. No, she is not. Listen, I've got my own work to think about here and I can't be bothered with all of this. If she can't pay the room, let them kick her out, okay, no problem. That old lady has more life left in her right this minute than you got left between your legs. Tell me something. Do you have any idea what it's like for a woman to grow old? Oh, a man, that's a different story. A man can live to be 90, and they still come to honor him. Like a general strutting all over the place, they hold parades for him and keep on saluting him. They pin medals on him until he drops dead. But a woman, oh, just let a woman get past 50 and she is nothing. Gone. Finished. Get rid of her. Kick her out. Send her off to an asylum where they can starve her to death and beat her up every day. (SOBBING) And it's people like you. You and your goddamn stupid rape scene. Well, I don't need you. I really don't need you. You can take your rape and you can rot with it. You can just rot with it. (SLAMS DOOR) (SOBBING) Here, signorina, these stock certificates are worthless. But these Bank of Congo, 1903. Yes? Yes? -Four hundred shares. -Yes. That would be 150,000 lire. Do you wish to have cash? A hundred and fifty? 150,000 lire? That's right. Ah, come here for a minute. I love you. Cash! -Thank you. -You're welcome. Cash is wonderful. I love cash. Oh, you do that so well. (LAUGHS) (LAUGHING) Where is the manager? Excuse me, I would like to know how much it is? How much what is? The Contessa's room. Two weeks in advance, no, make that three. Three weeks would be 17,500 lire. (SNEEZES) Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen... and 500 lire. You? No, hers. The money is hers. Thank you. You did it, you did it, Mario. What you've done is to go beyond the rape itself. What we have now will give the ending a new hope and a new vision. My dear friend, I believe we have found it. Thank you, Vittorio. The Contessa asked me to pick up her dinner. Oh, the Contessa. You wait here. I know exactly what she requires. And no charge. Not from me. Never a charge. Who is that girl, hmm? I've never seen her here before. I would like to meet her. Mmm? I can promise you the girl is cold, impossible. It won't do you any good, eh. Oh, please, Mario, I'm not thinking of going to bed with her. I am thinking of Angelica. Angelica? Her? Vittorio, you amaze me. I see that girl four times a day and never, never once did the idea occur to me. Hmm. Ask her to come over. Mmm-hmm. Tell her I wish to give her a screen test. Well? Are you still angry with me? Of course not. Then let me tell you. For two weeks now I have been working on Vicari. Who? The film director. I have begged him to give you a screen test and there's a part I've written especially for you. -For me? -Mmm-hmm. -With my compliments. -Thank you. Come along. I persuaded him to talk to you. Come on. Well, here she is, Vittorio. Her name is Nina. Oh, my pleasure, signorina. I was telling her there might be a possibility that you would give her a screen test. Would you consider it, Vittorio? Could you come to the studio tomorrow? It's not my day off. I'll talk to the, to the hotel Manager. No, no, come on your day off. Just as you are. No make-up. Nothing, huh? Thursday. Till Thursday, then. Thank you. I, uh... Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Thank you. Card, please. Oh, yes. I wonder. I know he said to come exactly as I am but I don't know, Contessa, do you think I should go to the hairdressers or something, maybe? Hmm? What did you say, dear? For my screen test, remember the film? Yes. Film. Film? Yes. Something new. Something American, no doubt. They're so terribly clever. Another card, please. All right. Um... Important changes in my life. (CHUCKLES) A beautiful house surrounded by water. Oh, how fascinating. I wonder. Look. Could it be Lake Como or Maggiore? Venice, perhaps? Huh? Oh, what's this? Oh! (LAUGHS) The Duke of Milan. I noticed him at dinner. Oh, completely bald. Shaved it all off. Lydia tells me he shaved his entire body. It must be a striking figure. I wonder how she knows. Oh, what a lovely evening. Oh, I'm so tired and yet devastated that it's almost over. Not too many, of course. Only 100 of my dearest friends. Venice, you know, is considered the city of art and love. (BIDDING FAREWELL) Goodnight, goodnight. Oh, what a triumph, eh? -Oh, goodnight. -Goodnight. I saw you but once all evening. I missed you. Gabriel. Goodnight. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Oh, your Highness. Please, you will call me Wilhelm. Oh, thank you, your Highness. I would hate to call you "the Kaiser." You are so adorable. Could we, could we perhaps, have dinner tomorrow night? I am afraid that's not possible, but call on me next week. I shall be waiting, impatiently. Goodnight. Goodnight! Goodnight, everyone.

You know, Gabriel d'Orazio once told me that someday I would have the world's richest man. And now... (LAUGHS) A very wise man, d'Orazio. Is it possible you love him only for his money? But of course I do. Why shouldn't I? Oh, dear, I wouldn't dream of telling an artist that didn't love him for his talent, or a poet for his poetry, or a composer for his music. No, men should be loved for what sets them apart. And with me it happens to be my fortune. -Mmm. -Mmm? It allows me to possess you against all others. So you see? We are allies, you and I. We each add something invaluable to the existence of one another. You listen to me. A screen test doesn't cost them anything. All they want to do is get into your pants. For nothing. You make them pay for it. Hmm? I'll just take my money. I won't take my purse. Well, wish me luck. Good luck. I'm scared! Oh, angel! Good luck. Thank you. I have to go. I'm leaving. I shan't be coming back. Ever again. I'm finished. You may send all my luggage to Hotel Minerva, in care of Gabriel d'Orazio. Goodbye. Signora Contessa? Hotel Minerva? I don't know it, Signora. Of course you do. On Piazza Minerva. Ah, there used to be Hotel Gran Minerva, but it was destroyed during the war. -Take me there. -I'm trying to tell you... Take me there. What do you mean she has checked out? I mean she's gone. Checked out. She is gone. Forever. She is never coming back. But where did she go? Hotel Minerva. Where is that? There is no Hotel Minerva. Gone. No more. I've got to find her! Stop here! That's the Forum Hotel, the Minerva was on the opposite side of the Piazzi. Thank you, there. -You. You, there. -Yes? You will tell Signor d'Orazio that the Contessa Sanziani is here. Uh, d'Orazio... -At once. -Who? Gabriel d'Orazio, can't you read? No, Madam, but here we have no one by that name. Oh, nonsense. He's been staying here for the last three weeks. No, signora. I'm sorry. But how dare you. Let me pass. Call the manager at once. What's the matter here? She slapped my face. May I ask who you are, signora? I am Contessa Sanziani and I am here to see Signor d'Orazio. We are leaving for Paris within the hour. Pardon, pardon. Ah! But there are his suitcases. And you pretend that he's not here? Gabriel! Gabriel! (CAR SCREECHING) (SCREAMING) (CLAMORING) MAN: Don't anyone touch her until the ambulance gets here! Are you sure? Well, if she comes back, will you please call me here? What are you doing back here? They're waiting for you. They're ready for you. Come along. Watch out. Watch it, watch it! The action's out here, not in the back? Be careful, be careful! We're gonna walk over here. That's it. MAN 1: All right. Bring over 32. Hurry up with that curtain. Come on, come on. For God's sake! Hurry up, hurry up. We won't need that one. (INDISTINCT) Bring up the light. Hurry up. Okay, Toni. Now the filter on 504. Bring it up. Listen, okay. Now high with that 32. Is the spot on the mark? MAN 2: Yes, sir. All right now, Toni, bring up the backdrop. -Bring it out. -Yeah. -MAN 1: A little bit higher. -Where the hell's that filter? What am I supposed to do? MAN 3: We're running. MAN 4: That's good. You on the end... By the stool. get over by the stool. That's good. That's good. Bring it down now. Sit down. -My feet don't... -Bring the blocks, the blocks. Okay. Stand up. Raise and lower with her for God's sake. That's good, that's good. Bring it down now. And take that boom out. Now walk down to the front mark. Got it? Move back. You, Nina. -MAN: Move back by the stool. -Yes. Sorry. Now, you've got a marker on the floor. See it? Yes. MAN 1: Don't look at it. Stay by it. MAN 2: Now sit down. Take one! MAN 2: All right now let's settle down. Now turn your head to the right. And now to the left. And now straight into the camera, good. For God's sakes, bring up number three! Come on. Now look straight out there, at the camera. Now tell us about yourself. Well, I... Cut. Hold it. Remo. Where the hell is that goddamned filter? Is the key spot on the mark? Yes, sir. It's about time! Okay then, let's go. Let's go! Rolling. Take two! Settle down! Nina! Yes? At the camera. How do you feel? Uh... Hot. MAN: Are you happy? Are you sad? Which one do you want? Now, turn to the camera. The camera's over here. Talk now. Well? How can I possibly tell? She won't talk. I think I can get her to talk. Mario. You mind if I try? Go. Go ahead. George, keep the camera on her and push in, okay? Got you, got you. Okay. Keep rolling and go in slowly. Camera reloading. Oh, Mario, I tell you, I didn't know you were there, I couldn't see anything. I wasn't very good, was I? It's all right. Relax. Now, they're reloading the camera, hmm? Yeah. You're hot. Nervous, eh? It's been a terrible day. I know. The Contessa's gone. God knows where. Do you know what I was thinking? All the time lived in that hotel and I never got to know her. She could have told me so many stories. Oh, no, Mario, she doesn't tell stories to anyone. She lives them... She's living through all of the great moments of her life. And what a fantastic life. Having sold herself to all the great men of the world. Sanziani never sold herself to anyone. Anyone. She never cared about money. She still, she doesn't even know what money is now. What she did care about, what she worshipped, was genius. All kinds of genius. Men who accomplished great things in this world. Statesmen and poets, and painters and composers. She gave herself to them in return for their genius. She gave them the greatest gift of all. She made them feel like gods. No wonder men wanted, no wonder they'd give up everything they had for her, and not just money, they gave everything. I couldn't live... I couldn't live without her. Don't say that. You've got to be realistic. What if she's dead? Why? You've heard something, haven't you? No, it's okay. You just have to tell me though. Please, you must tell me. MARIO: I only know what you know. (SOBBING) People die because we let them, because we wish to get rid of them. Nobody dies. Nobody dies unless we let them. Those are her words. She said people only die because we let them. She thought that nobody cared about her. Well, I care about her. I don't want you to die. Please. Live, for me. Please... (GROANING) (SOBBING) Please! Well? She is fantastic. Where's Nina? She just ran out. -Did you see Nina? -No, I haven't seen her. -Where is she? -She went out that way. Didn't say a thing, kept right on going. MARIO: Come on. You put on your prettiest dress. Hmm? Let's see what you have here. Now, which one shall we choose? Which one for the new movie star? Nina, she'll be back. Maybe she just went out to visit a friend for the day. I'm sorry. The manager told me when I came in here, he said she's checked out. She's gone, but all of her clothes are still in her room. I just know something's happened to her. I know it. Nothing's happened to her, nothing at all. Anyway we're gonna find her. We will find her. If we have to, to take Rome all apart, stone by stone. Every street, every alley, every piazza. Believe me, we will find her. Thank you. The Contessa, she is in the hospital. They called from the hospital, the Santo Spirito, at the Vatican. What happened? What happened? An accident, automobile accident. They asked for someone to bring her things. A nightgown and slippers. I'm afraid she's nearly gone. (PRAYING IN LATIN) NUN: Are you a relative? Eh, no, I'm a friend. Sister Cecilia, I can hardly feel it anymore. Are you a relative? No, I'm just a friend. There isn't much time left, you mustn't expect her to recognize you. Come with me. I'll be right back. -Contessa... -I'm sorry. You've come too late. God is with her. This is la Contessa Sanziani, isn't it? Did you bring this for her? What? You brought her this? Yes, I brought her... Perhaps you may consider leaving it for another patient. They are so terribly poor. Yes. God bless you. And could you tell me who will take care of the funeral? We or you? If you leave it to us, we shall have to send her to a common grave. No. No. That won't be necessary. You see, she has plenty of money. No. You can deposit the money at the office on your way out. We'll do all that is necessary. All right. How old... -What? -How... Did you say something? How old was she when... I mean, how old did she think she was when she died? I don't know. But she did say something to me at the very end. I believe she must have regained consciousness. She said, "Is life over already?" Thank you. Do you know what you've done for me? You've made me think of myself as really being someone. Don't give up your memories, Contessa, please. I mean, for your sake as well as for mine. I feel like am a part of them now. Oh, Contessa, if only I could be like you. CONTESSA: You should never wish to be like anyone else in this world unless you want to be a copy. If you are not an original you are nothing. Be yourself. That's the important thing. The world worships the original. It's yours. I give it to you, Nina. -Please? -How did you get here? Come along, don't bother Nina, do you hear me? -No, no, that's all right. -Yes, ma'am. May I have an autograph? Yes, of course you can. Someday I want to be exactly like you. Oh, never. Be yourself. That's the important thing. The world, you see, worships the original.
