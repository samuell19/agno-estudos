One...two...three...four. Total four holes! The air is getting blocked. The air is getting blocked. Don't block the air, don't block the air. Move! Oh, sorry. Sorry, sorry! -Idiot! -Extremely sorry. My mind doesn't work properly unless I take in the London air. Anyway, tell me what you were saying. I was saying that there are four holes in this man's body. Bullet. I can see that. Why did you call me for a case like this? Actually sir, we can't understand through which hole... the bullet entered and caused his death. Of course. Who better than a Bengali to find loopholes? Hmm. What about the letter I sent to the Queen, asking her to cook pumpkin curry? Oh yes, sir. Yes, yes, yes. Queen Victoria is cooking pumpkin... what do you call...curry for you herself. That's good. So, did you find any blackmail letter? Blackmail? Letter? No. What about a cryptic riddle? No. Finger print? No, sir. What the hell! No blackmail letters, no cryptic riddles... No finger print either. How is a detective supposed to investigate? I'm forced to say that... -this is a conspiracy against detectives. -Hmm. It is acceptable in a backward country like India. But this is not expected from an advanced country like yours! We are extremely sorry, sir. Actually, going forward we'll circulate a notice in the city. -Especially for potential murderers. -Damn it! Yes, please circulate a notice. Make sure it clearly states... That there can be no murder without threats, riddles or finger prints. Or else, the murder shall be considered illegal! Right. If there's a murder with no clue left behind... it will be not be recognised in the eyes of the law. Absolutely right, sir. -Any traces poison in the body? -Poison in the food? But the death is because of gun shots. Okay, maybe there was no poison in food but it could be food poisoning. -Oh. -Do you know if he had diarrhea? No. -Was the urine yellow? -No, sir. What the hell were you doing, then? Whiling your time away? He has been shot dead. -Four holes! -Shut up! My God! "Four holes!" Idiot! If there was excessive gas formation in the stomach... How would it escape? Wouldn't it burst out of these holes? Just cares about the holes. Thinks he's a know-it-all! Here it is! But you said there were no clues. What does it signify, sir? Four spots on this card. And four holes in the body. I see. See how I put two and two together? This card is a clue to finding the murderer. Then what about food poisoning? Food poisoning canceled. Detective Mahimchandra will catch the murderer with just this card. Just wait and watch. Watson? Watson? Watson! Watson! Watson. Watson? -Hey! Bloody Watson! -Huh? -One moment, sir. -Watson! -Watson! -It's Hutashon, sir. A four of clubs in the victim's pocket and four holes in the body. We must get going, Watson. Let's go! Sir, I'm Hutashon. How many times do I need to repeat myself? -Sir! -Hey! Don't you dare run away... Huh? Sign here. -When did I return from London? -London? When did you go to London? You've been rotting away at this detective agency for ages. -Damn it! -London! You wouldn't believe what an interesting case I'd found, Watson. Wake up from your daydream, sir. The commissioner called you a long time ago. I didn't wake you up. -Okay, it'll be done. -Let's go. Come on. Mahim, this is going beyond all limit. Why aren't you paying attention to your work? What's your problem? What to do, sir? What can I do? I never find a case interesting enough to nourish my mind. -No nutrition in mind. -Shut up! You've done a great job in arresting those Swadeshi terrorists. Thank you. I want you to keep up the same performance. Now, take this up. His name is Raktambar Dhar. We have been keeping an eye on him. Every day, the boy stands on the road in the darkness... when the District Mmagistrate's carriage passes. We suspect that the boy is planning to kill the District Magistrate. Track him down. I want you to catch him red-handed. Understand? Hey! We went a few days back. Damn it! I'm sick of this job. Absolutely right, sir. It's such an absurd job. I can't even tell my wife what exactly I do. Even my wife has tried to ask me in a lot of ways. -You know what I do then? -What? I tactfully avoid it. Oh. But beware, sir. Your wife isn't a simpleton like mine. She's an educated woman. -Someday she'll catch you. -Huh! It's not that easy. If you don't mind can I say something? -Can I? -Tell me! You got married recently, sir. Instead of reading detective novels all day spend some time with your wife. And focus on your work. Take it. Hmmph! What's wrong, Sudhamukhi? It's getting dark, why haven't you turned on the lights yet? I was just about to. Sudhamukhi, how about a round of cards? Sure, you get the deck out. I'll be right there. Okay-- Tell me something... Why do you light a lantern every evening? -Well, the other day I saw a scorpion... -Oh. That's why I keep an eye out every evening. -Sneha? -Yes? Did your brother say when he'll be back? That crackpot is very unpredictable. -You come. -Hmm. Sir, this is the street. And here is that lamppost... where Raktambar waits every day to assassinate the Magistrate. Raktambar is a hardened criminal, you know. Huh! He's giving the British sleepless nights. If we can catch him-- I mean, if you can catch him... then your promotion will be guaranteed. GENERAL STRIKE ON OCTOBER 16 I'll know what's on his mind as soon as I see him. (humming) -Sneha? -Hmm? Why does your brother come home so late at night? What does he do? Do you know? How would I know? You're his wife. Doesn't he tell you anything? He tells me he's a tax recovery agent for the government. Who does he collect tax from so late at night? -Sir, look at him. That's-- -Say no more. -I recognise him. -Ah. The unibrow means he's a violent criminal. Criminals often have a beard to hide the scars on their face. -But sir, he's the post-- -Hush! Don't waste time on relative matters like the past, present and future, Watson. -Let's follow him. -Follow who? Raktambar Dhar, of course. He looks like a very talented murderer. Hey! Turn away. Hide yourself! -But this is Chidam. -Who? The post office peon, Chidam. That letter the commissioner posted never reached ma'am. Please let us ask him where the letter is? Are you mocking me? Huh? Chidam! -Sneha? -Yes? Has your brother always been like this? Like what? Crazy? Tell me, you mean girl! Tell me, when your father fixed your marriage... why didn't he get my brother's brain tested? -Oh God! -These mosquitoes! Uff! -Sir? -Yes? Look. -Where? -There. -Who's this? -Raktambar Dhar. I recognised him the moment I saw him. His clean-shaven face proves that he has a scheming mind. But you just said that criminals have unibrows and beards. Who's the detective here, Watson? It's you, sir. So who will decide if criminals are bearded or clean-shaven? You, sir. -Then follow me. -Who will you follow? The man is just standing there. Follow me means... -Follow my orders. -Oh. I've told you so many times to sharpen that thick brain of yours. Look, look, look! -I'm sure he's carrying a bomb. -To kill whom? Well, the District Magistrate will pass this area soon. -So let's go stop him! -Uff! You're working at a detective agency with an empty brain? If we catch him now will you be able to prove that he intended to commit murder? The moment he's about to throw the bomb... Oh my God! But by then, the Magistrate will be dead! So what can I do about it? How strange! I have simply been asked to prove that he intends to murder. I haven't received any orders to prevent the murder. Watson, I just got married. I don't want to risk losing my job now. I don't feel like playing anymore. Tell me something, what kind of parents do you have? They married you to a man only because he's wealthy and has a government job? Why? Your brother is no less than any other man. How sweet! Sudhamukhi, do you make love at night? You're becoming cheeky by the day, Sneha. -Why? Come on, please tell me. -Sneha. -Please tell me? -Sneha! -Tell me, come on! -Don't do this. -Tell me, tell me! -Sneha, stop-- -Please tell me! -Don't, Sneha. Stop it! -Why are you doing this? -Why are you feeling so shy? Just tell me! Sudhamukhi? I'd tell you if there was something to say. -Sir. -Hmm? Sir! That's the Magistrate's carriage. Hmm. GENERAL STRIKE ON OCTOBER 16 Raktambar, bring out the bomb. Throw it! Come on, Raktambar, do it! Take out the bomb! Throw it at the carriage! Throw it! -Watson? -Yes? -What just happened? -He didn't kill today, sir. -There you are, Doctor. -Raktambar? -Yes. -I got a little delayed. Oh. I couldn't make it the last two days. How can I leave all my patients at the dispensary and come here? And why do you feel embarrassed to go to the dispensary, Raktambar? How can I help it, Doctor? Your dispensary and my in-laws' place are in the same neighbourhood. If I go there... everyone will get to know about my hemorrhoids. Oh, that's true. Doctor, this has my stool sample. Please conduct a test and see what's wrong. I spend six hours of my day in the toilet! -Yuck! -It's such a pain. -Disgusting! -I don't know what to do. Disgusting! Disgusting! -Disgusting! -Where are you going? Fool! Imbecile! Nincompoop! You have the potential to be an ideal criminal. And you're spending a quarter of your day on the toilet? You jackass! When will we have a real criminal in this damned country of ours, doctor? -Who are you, huh? -Hey! -Are you here to lecture me, huh? -Keep that away from me. -Can you feel my pain? -Remove that. -Want to see? -Keep it away! No, no, no! -Don't you dare! -Hey! Run! -Want to see how bad it hurts? -Sir, watch your step! -Sir! Get up! -Oh God! -Hurry, or he'll throw his s**t at us! -Lets go! -What a failure this investigation was. -All because of that haemorrhoid patient. -Will he still throw it at us? -No need to look back. Let's go. Oh no! What a deep gash! What kind of a job is this? Why do you have to recover money at this hour? You don't know how cunning this client is. Even the British government is scared of recovering money from him. -Mahim? -Hmm? You don't lie to me, right? Why should I lie to you? We hardly spend time with each other. Don't you ever feel suspicious of me? Sudhamukhi, it's my job to be suspicious of people. Tracking who paid up, how much is owed. I'd rather not bring it home. But it's not my job. It's my nature to be suspicious. If you give me any opportunity to suspect you... I won't let it go. (song playing) Uff! GENERAL STRIKE ON OCTOBER 16 -How many are we done with? -About ten. Sudha...here? -Where's the Professor? -Just a minute. BENGAL IS FOR HINDUS AND MUSLIMS NO ONE CAN DIVIDE US What's the matter? Don't come here unannounced, Sudhamukhi. This can get the entire group into trouble. I'm sorry, Professor. Actually, I couldn't help it when I heard the news. -Is it true, Professor? -Hmm. Lord Curzon wants to divide our beloved Bengal to pieces. The British government wants to create a divide between Hindus and Muslims here. But we aren't taking it lying down. We're getting ready to give them a befitting reply. The group is growing in strength, right? Hmm. It is. And it'll grow even bigger. Boys and girls from every household in Bengal are joining hands with us to bring this conspiracy to a halt. Professor... Can't you take me back into the group? No. A revolution calls for a monk's mind... and a warrior's promptness. Women and gold weakens a revolutionary's heart. So a revolutionary can't have any feelings? I don't want to argue with you, Sudhamukhi. We are engaged in something very significant. It calls for strict restraint. I have seen great potential go to waste. I can't let that happen again. (indistinct chatter) Very well. When you've already decided not to let a woman into the group... Then don't refuse the gold, at least, Professor. If my cursed beauty is in the way of our country's service... then let me reduce my sorrow by providing some money. I have a husband who works for the government. Let me be of some use to my country. Please don't turn me away, Professor. What are you doing? Ruining my own and my country's future. You know, my father said he won't let me study anymore. What? What do you mean? He says that it's not good for girls to get an education. He can't stand Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar. But then... But then, how will we meet? Mother found your letter under my pillow. Since then, Father has been looking for a suitor. And... And you'll agree to it? Don't you get a say? You need independence to express your own opinion. So first, we must make a firm demand for it. Sudhamukhi, Abani had come here. He just spoke me. My father? What did he say? He doesn't want you to continue with your studies. So, he told me to forbid you from coming here. What should I do, Professor? Until the country becomes independent... you should accept your family's wishes like an obedient daughter. How can you say this? You may go now, Sudhamukhi. Wait, Manmatha. I need to talk to you alone. I have been informed that... you didn't attend the Swaraj Samiti meeting day before yesterday. Why? -I had some personal work. -Don't lie, Manmatha. Service to the country is above all other work. It was a mistake to involve you in this with your weak resolve. Weak? -I'm weak, Professor? -Certainly. Jatin told me that instead of attending the meeting day before yesterday... you had taken Sudhamukhi to the theatre in the evening. Wow! The boys are spying on me instead of serving the nation. That too is a service to the nation. The reason for you to agree to discontinue Sudhamukhi studies... is now clear to me. But stifling the heart and turning people into machines... can't bring about a revolution. I learnt this from you, Professor. Goodbye. -Mahim? -Who's there? Oh. Won't you go to sleep? Yes. Sudhamukhi. You read the papers. Can you tell me why the criminals in our country are so stupid and cowardly? And just look at their crimes. They're harmless, straightforward. Let's hope it stays this way. -It's not nice if crimes are on the rise. -What's wrong with you, Sudhamukhi! Read these books. They commit such beautifully twisted psychological murders abroad. They probe into the dark recesses of the human mind. And here? Rubbish! Why do even need to probe into the dark recesses? Are you serious? Sudhamukhi, bloodshed involves a... terrible, monstrous madness which you can't even imagine. When will the wretched people of country get a taste of it? Look at the frauds here. They commit crimes and ineptly get caught in their own traps. I caught one of them at Burrabazar the other day. What do you mean by "caught"? I mean, I read about it. I mean, I read it in the papers. Let's go in. Something looks suspicious about this death, Chhaganlal. Who told you that, Detective? There's no scope for suspicion. The terrible heat! My goodness! My younger brother couldn't tolerate it. He suffered a heart attack and he left us all. But your servants said that a few days ago, you and your brother... fought over the partition of your iron business. -Who's the detective here? -You, sir. -Then who will interrogate? -You. Hmm. As I was saying... Is it true, what Watson just said? Apparently, he said that he wouldn't give his brother... any share of the business. I'll shut up now. I swear on God. It's a lie, Detective. I told him that after returning from Haridwar... I'll divide the business into two parts. Huh. -You're saying the truth, aren't you? -I swear on God! I swear it's a hundred percent true. Where have you gone, Maganlal... -Chhaganlal. -Yes? You turned out to be a true devotee. Your gods are here to bear witness for your statement. -Huh? -Come take a look. -Come take a look. -Really? -Huh? Let me see. -Here it is. Huh? What the hell? What the hell! -Do you wear your rings the wrong side in? -Yes, it's comfortable that way. Otherwise, it hurts. -Damn it! -Huh? -And you're admitting it too! -Yes. -Oh no! -Who named you Chhaganlal? Your should be called "Chhagallal"! What does that mean? It means you're as dumb as sheep! Sir, he's vegetarian. A goat, then. -Right. -What? You murdered someone with an empty brain like that, huh? -Rubbish! -No, wait a minute. Tell me frankly. Did you do it or was it someone else? You did it? Damn it! Just see, he's admitting it to me! Ridiculous! Has your brain stopped working? What do you think of me? -I don't want to hear another word. -You dare to threaten Chhaganlal? -Let go, brother! Let go of me! -I'll strangle you. I'll finish you off. -Shame on you! -Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! He was a very dishonest man, Detective. He had ruined my business. Detective, please forgive me just this one time. I'll never murder with my rings on again. -Never again. -Chhaganlal, listen to me. Try to understand my disappointment here. It's great that you murdered your brother. It's great that you killed that cheat. -But-- -Chhaganlal, don't you know about gloves? You could have worn gloves before killing him! Hey! Why didn't you buy gloves? Why didn't you buy them, huh? Were you saving up for an offering to God after death? Couldn't you wear the ring the right way up, you idiot? Exactly. I'm sorry. I made a huge mistake. I'll never make these mistakes again. It's alright. Don't cry, Chhaganlal. God knows when this cursed country will see a shrewd criminal. -Watson. -Yes, sir? Take him away. Go, Chhaganlal. What's taking you so long? Get up! Come! Out! Sure your master was the one who killed him? Yes, sir. Sudhamukhi. Won't you go to bed? Call him. What... Hurry up. Hmm. Mahim? -Mahim? -Hmm? Are you going to continue reading? It's very late. Let's go to bed. Yes. -Sudhamukhi? -Hmm? When will people write novels on Bengali detectives too? And housewives like you won't have to waste time sleeping at night. Instead, you can sharpen your wit by reading them. Bengal is about to see worse days. Lord Curzon has ordered the Partition of Bengal. Are you even aware of it? Why should I? These are political issues. My job to is to deal with criminals. I mean, tax frauds. Do you like being subjugated by the British? Why? What's wrong with the British? They've educated the people of our country. Abolished horrible traditions like "Sati", burning the widow. They've allowed women to study, introduced the railways... And most importantly, they've produced a detective like Sherlock Holmes. And that's done us a load of good. What about occupying and exploiting our nation? What about the merciless torture of those wanting freedom? Oh dear! It's fine that you're saying this to me behind closed doors. But don't say it to anyone else. Look, Sudhamukhi. We have recently got married. We have just started our family life. I can't lose my job now. Go to sleep. Where are you off to? I'm reading a very interesting detective novel. I won't be able to sleep until I finish it. Read it on the bed. But won't it disturb your sleep? You sleep. I'll go over there. Sudhamukhi. Oh shoot! Who is it? Sudhamukhi. I'm not at home most of the time. Always keep the front door locked. Huh. You do worry about me, then? Oh please! Are you serious? How can I not worry about you? You're my... ...better half. Actually... I've been noticing something strange for the last few days. Tea, please. Sir, your tea. What's wrong? What have you been noticing? A genius. Maybe Bengal's cursed days are finally coming to an end, Sudhamukhi. Sudhamukhi, your clothes are in that room. Hmm. -Don't be too late. -Okay. Sudha. What! You? Sudhamukhi? Are you done? Manmatha, you... With me dressed like this... It's not the first time I'm seeing you like this, Sudha. You're forgetting, Manmatha... that I'm married to someone else now. You shouldn't have come to meet me like this. Sudhamukhi? We wasted all our lives thinking about what we should or shouldn't do. Why are you ruining your life like this? Come with me. You're not sticking to what we had decided, Manmatha. Sudhamukhi? Sudhamukhi? Where did you go? Sudha! Come with me, Sudha. Don't kill yourself like this, Sudha. Come with me. -Sudhamukhi? -No, Manmatha. -That's not possible. You go. -Sudhamukhi? No, I won't. You come with me. -Come with me, Sudha. -Go away, Manmatha! Sudhamukhi? Sudhamukhi? Sudha-- What are you doing here? My sari... Don't know who kept it here. Let's go. This is the sketch of Arunabha Chattopadhyay. He is the main culprit behind the murder... of His Excellency, Charles Robertson. Whoever can catch him... He will be promoted to the post of head of this detective department. And the government... has announced a prize of Rs. 1000 to catch him. We want him dead or alive. Do you love your country like you used to, Manmatha? It's simply what you think, Professor... That if you love someone, your love towards another decreases. Is that so? Then prove it. That's the unfortunate part, Professor. You have to prove your love for your country... by blowing your own trumpet. Even Sita had to go through the most severe test, Manmatha. To prove her love for her husband. Killing the people of your own country... -What kind of freedom would that bring? -Really? Have you, the student of Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Surendranath Banerjee... taken the middle path? Let me make it clear. Your non-violent approach... can never win us independence. Never! Enemies of the country have to be killed! I can't do it. You... Ask someone else to do it, Professor. Bravo! Bravo! Where did it go, Manmatha... the burning Vesuvius within your heart? How could you forget... your brother... whom the British police tortured to death in jail? Did you simply forget? Why do you always remind me about the same thing? No. Looks like love really does weaken a person. -Love for your country is also love. -Correct. Love. The greatest kind of love. And for that, you need... a tough heart. And if you have to make some sacrifices to prove your love... ...you do it. Hmm? Come. Come with me. The Goddess... is a symbol of undivided Bengal. She embodies destruction on the one hand... and creation on the other. Anyone who wants to divide Bengal... She will rip off their heads and drink their blood. So, light the fire within your heart, Manmatha. Sudhamukhi has left you and married someone else. Don't become weak thinking about her. And the responsibility of slaying the demon... the Goddess wants to bestow upon you. And that you must do yourself. Take it. Hold it. Go on. Take it. Hail to thee, Mother! Hail to thee, Mother! Hail to thee, Mother! -Sir? -Yes. -Sign this file and send it upstairs soon. -Okay. Don't delay-- -Don't delay, okay? -Okay. What's going on, sir? While the entire office is trying to catch Arunabha Chattopadhyay... you're just sitting here and snacking away? I'm not interested in arresting any more freedom fighters. That won't do, sir. How will you get promoted unless you arrest them? You did a great job of arresting some of them a few days ago. For cases like that, you need to run about more than rack your brains. You keep waiting for days and then they suddenly get caught. And the motive? Same old freedom for the country. There's no... There's nothing new about it. I don't like all this. I really don't get you. What kind of a case do you want? One that has twist after twist. Layer after layer. Like? -You want to know? -Yes! Let me give you an example. Last night, Krishnamohan was murdered on the terrace of his house. There's a poisoned fish bone in his left butt cheek. That's why his wife, Khentimoni is wailing. When we reached... the fish bone was still stuck in his butt cheek. This is the first time I saw a fish bone like that, Watson. Come back to me... But. But upon investigation, it was found... -That it wasn't Krishnamohan... -Then? but his wife, Khentimoni, who was the target. -Oh. -Or...Or let's say... Before Krishnamohan, six more-- No, not six, three. Three more people were killed similarly with a fish bone in the buttocks! Well sir, given how expensive fish is... wouldn't it be cheaper to get him bitten by a snake? But that would make it convenient, easier. Where are the twists and turns in the plot? The most significant thing is... The fact that a fish bone is used as a weapon... What do we understand from that, Watson? What do we understand? We understand that the murderer... ...sells fish. KHEMANKARI FISH MARKET DEEP WATER FISH SELLER That's how we reach murderer Khemankari's fish market. A maze-like fish market. It's pitch dark and various kinds of fish are found all over the place. We have to look through all of them, Watson. But we won't find the fish we're looking for soon. Then, suddenly... We'll find a secret tunnel. And right there... At last... in the fish's belly we found... a ring with Khentimoni's name on it! Khentimoni's ring was found... inside the belly of a fish? Just like King Dushyant had given a ring to Shakuntala as a symbol of his love. I've got it! I've got it, sir. Khemankari was secretly in love with Krishnamohan. But Krishnamohan was married to Khentimoni. That's why Khemankari takes revenge by killing Krishnamohan... so that she can steal the ring he had given to his wife. My foot! Actually, it was the other way round. Khemankari was in love with... -...Khentimoni. -What! "Shed not the band of love I tied with your soul." But it is illegal. And Khentimoni's father forces her to marry Krishnamohan. To punish her for this injustice... Khemankari brought a fish bone from her own shop... and committed the murder. Khemankari stuck the fish bone in Krishnamohan's buttocks? Do you think about this gibberish all day, sir? Gibberish, huh? Gibberish? One day, this will be published and readers will lap it up. Published? Rubbish! Then why were three other people killed with fish bones? That's...that's important to thicken the plot. -Come on, let's go. -Go where? Office time isn't over yet. Have you ever seen a player of the big leagues? What, sir? A player of the big leagues. Come, I'll show you. Sir! Sir, wait! Office time isn't over yet. What a hassle! Sir! Sir! MAKE TAGORE'S UNITY FESTIVAL A SUCCESS MAKE TAGORE'S UNITY FESTIVAL A SUCCESS OBSERVE NO COOKING DAY ON OCTOBER 16 What's going on here, Watson? -Haven't you heard, sir? -No. On October 16, the Partition of Bengal is coming into effect. That's why there's a strike all over Kolkata. Apparently, no food will be cooked at anyone's house that day. And to maintain unity in the country, that day... everyone will heed Tagore's call to tie knot of unity on each other. God knows how all this absurdity will help. Really! Such energetic youth in our society. They should be sharpening their wit by reading detective novels but no. They just want to free the country! This is why our country is hopeless. Just hopeless. -Two teas, please. -Celebrating unity like this. Sudhamukhi? There's a letter for you. -Letter from who? -I'm not educated enough to know. Must be from my brother. I've offered to give you lessons so many times. Times are changing. Spare me, Sudhamukhi. I've heard that educated girls have a life of suffering. And you know, Sudhamukhi... Sudhamukhi? What's wrong? Nothing. Check if the rice is cooked. Go! Okay. Sudhamukhi. I came face-to-face with your husband. What a man he is! I'm writing to warn you about an imminent danger to him. Danger? If something happens to him... I should not be held responsible. Yours, Manmathanath Majumdar. He's here... -That man? -Yes, do you see him, Watson? Yes. Looks ordinary. Two arms, two legs, two eyes. And a razor-sharp mind, which others don't have. Razor-sharp mind? How? -Then let me tell you. -Yes. -It happened a few days ago. -Oh. I'm sorry. What happened, Bhupati? Wait, sit down. A perfectly healthy man suddenly died of heart failure. Okay. So what? Really? Can't you tell that it's a very shrewd murder? A shrewd murder? What are you saying, sir? I'm right, Watson. I'm telling you, the moment he bumped into Bhupati... Bhupati's heart gave way and he died. Do you know what actually happened? Bhupati and that man were crossing ways. He bumped into Bhupati on purpose. In that brief moment, he pulled a jujitsu punch on him! And that killed Bhupati immediately. Sir, please go home immediately. Live a happy married life with your wife. You're completely losing your mind. Exceptional people have always been called crazy. Nothing new about it. It's a natural death, he died of a heart attack. And you say it's a jujitsu punch! -What rubbish are you saying? -It's the truth! Don't argue with me now. I'm telling you, Watson. This man will change Bengal's dismal criminal world. I must know why and how he killed Bhupati. -Hold this. -Huh? You stay here. Hey, there. How are you? Uh... Sorry, I thought you were someone else. Did you see that, Watson? He has the potential to be a great criminal in future. Why was he shocked to see you? Good observation. Criminals must have greater control over their nerves. He has to pursue this more seriously. If criminals become too smart, sir... -...detectives like us won't have a job. -Yes. -Why are you still waiting? Follow him! -Yes, come on! -Watson, who's the detective? -You, sir. -Then who will give the orders to follow? -You. Whatever! Why do you forget? Let's go! -Yes, let's go. KOLKATA STUDENT LODGE Let's go. Excuse me. Sir. -What? -Yes? This man who just went in, does he stay here? -Who, Manmatha? -Yes. What's his full name again? Manmathanath Majumdar. -Right, Manmathanath Majumdar. -He stays here. But why are you looking for him? Me? I... I am his friend. -Friend? -Hmm. All his friends have gone home for the vacations. He's here alone. But I've never seen you here before. Hmm? How would you? I'm his childhood friend. Oh. Goodbye. Suddenly his childhood friend turns up now! -Sir? -Yes? What are we going to do now? I didn't pay attention to my studies when I was younger, Watson. I'm planning to start again. Where are you going? I have to leave town for a few days on some important work. You aren't going anywhere. I won't let you go. What a hassle! I often have to go out for work. This time you won't go. Please listen to me. Why are you behaving like this? Why aren't you listening to me? -I'm scared. -Scared? Why? For me? Please! I repel Death! Nothing will happen to me. Don't worry, I'll... I'll write to you. What work is this? That someone else can't do? Someone else? No one else is good enough for it. I have to do it and I must be successful too, Sudhamukhi. Someone else! Bye, Sudhamukhi. You didn't listen to a word I said. Goodbye. Who is it? May I come in? Who are you? Hello. I'm Nishipadma Poddar. My goodness! -Nishipadma? -Yes. My mother used to say my face looks just like a lotus. -But the lotus is hidden in the mud. -Yes, and I'm here to clean it. What do you mean? -You'll be staying here? -Yes. -This is a student lodge. -I'm also a student. -You're a student? -Yes. Don't even ask, Manmatha. It's really sad. I didn't pay attention to my studies when I was young. That's why, in this old age, I'm prey to such embarrassment. My son has brought home a dog of a foreign breed. And he understands nothing but English. That's why I took admission in college so I don't lose face in front of the dog. I'm in the room next to yours. So why are you here? I just plonked myself here! Please don't mind, I'm a little clingy. Where are you from, Manmatha? Hooghly. Why? Hooghly? Very nice. You're related to Bhupati, aren't you? Bhupati who? You know, Bhupati Sen from Kumortuli. The man who died of heart attack the other day in front of my house. Bhupati... Bhupati Sen? I don't know any Bhupati Sen. Oh. Thought I saw you in the neighbourhood that day. You're mistaken. Maybe your eyes are growing weak. Quite possible. Sir, your milk. Give it here, son. I take opium. That's why I drink a lot of milk. I love the cream of the milk. I hope you drink milk every day too? You look like you work out. Do you know jujitsu? Why should I tell you? Of course. Alright. We'll become friends gradually. I'll come and bother you at times. Please don't mind. Goodbye. -Nishipadma. -Yes? Did you lose something? Me? No. Everything is intact. What could I lose? What do I even have to lose? Bye. Oh! Thank you. You know, Watson. I think he has guessed what's on my mind. But I must say. Manmatha is a worthy prey for a hunter like me. Jujitsu! So you haven't been able to make friends with him yet? -How will I? I can't get close to him. -Why? -Actually, there's a problem, Watson. -What? I've lost my moustache. I have the beard... -...but can't find the moustache. -What! How will you be a detective if you're so distracted? I had to beg for the beard and moustache from a theatre troupe. -Hmmph! -Watson, Watson, Watson. Please get me another moustache. I have the beard, just need the moustache. Damn it! That means you've made no progress at all? Hey! Mahimchandra is no amateur. If Manmatha is cunning, I'm no less. I have already searched his room. Eh? He has put down all his thoughts in this notebook. Well done, sir! Really! You're so good at your job. With your perseverance, you'll prove that he murdered Bhupati. But how do you plan to go about it? Hmm? What's your next move? To know what's going on in this genuis' mind, we need... a woman. A woman? -Who? -Harimati. There she is! Welcome, Harimati, welcome. Come in, come in. Watson, have you given her all the instructions properly? -Have you told her what to do? -Yes, yes. Harimati, he has told you what do, right? Look, sir. I want the daily fees at the beginning of each day. I'm making that clear right from the start. Okay? I'll work for you till eight pm. If you want me to work till later, you have to pay me extra. -Let me make that clear too. -Oh gosh! You fleece us here at the detective agency. -And at night, you fleece your clients! -Watson. -You still want more money, you whore? -Watson! Mind your tongue! I'm earning off my beauty. -What's your problem, huh? -Harimati, Harimati, Harimati. -Don't get angry. -If you're going to insult me... -I'm leaving. -No, no, no! -Get lost! -No, Harimati! Why are you getting angry? Did I say I won't pay you? -We're about to begin something-- -To hell with your work! Oh. You have to first pay me two days' advance. Only then will I leave from your office. What's this? How will she be of any help to you, sir? Watson! Talk properly! -Talk to Harimati with respect. -Huh? From now on, she's my... ...lover. Hmmph! Are you serious? -You are... -In love with her. You see, my heart feels restless at this age. -Don't you have a wife? -Oh, please! That hardly makes a difference. She has no charm. Moreover, we've been together for so long that it has become stale. And I just can't do without young, hot girls. Manmatha, do me a favour. Harimati just won't return my love. -What's surprising about that? -No, no, no. Manmatha, please do something. I can't live without Harimati. What can I do? I have some work. I've to leave. What work? Jujitsu training? Again? Jujitsu again, huh? Why have you been obsessed with jujitsu since that day? No, no. Let me tell you about it in detail. Remember your relative-- My relative, Bhupati, who passed away? Later, I heard that he didn't die of a heart attack. Someone used jujitsu to murder him. What are you trying to say, huh? -That I murdered him? -Oh, no. Not at all. Why should you murder him? But you know what, Manmatha? There's a strange pleasure in committing murder. It's not for everyone. Why not try it once, huh? Goodbye. What! You discarded this one too? Uff! My brother has no sense. It's been so long. But he hasn't asked about his wife. And Sudhamukhi, why are you playing if you don't feel like it? Sneha. Why is your brother so interested in detective novels? Do you know? How would I know? And why are you asking this all of a sudden? He isn't a detective himself, right? My brother? A detective? My brother, a detective? Oh, Sudhamukhi! -No, I can't do all that. -Manmatha, Manmatha. Harimati goes to the park every day. I've decided to propose to her there. -What a hassle! -Please help me out. -Please help me. -But how-- -How can I help? -Just be there with me. Be there with me. Give me moral support, that's it. -I really need your help. -What the hell are you doing? -Promise you'll help me, Manmatha? -Okay-- -Fine. Now let go of my hand. -Thank you! -What are you...let go! -Thank you! -What a hassle-- -Thank you. -Again! Let go! -Thank you so much. It's okay. Let go. Okay then, goodbye. Don't-- Uff! (humming) Look, Manmatha. There she is. Come, come with me. -Harimati? -Hmm? Here he is. Remember I told you about Manmatha? How handsome! Hmm. "O why must the moon rise again tonight And fill with tears these forlorn eyes? Why every night should she fill the skies?" Go to him. And take this. Go! Go close to him. "And though I know he cannot be attained This fiery 'burning', how can I quench?" Yearning, not burning. What? Hmm? "...This fiery yearning, how can I quench? Why again? -Oh why tonight must the moon rise again?" -"...must the moon rise again?" Who are you, handsome? At first sight, I give my heart to you. Huh? To me? -Give me a hug. -Hey! What the hell are you doing? Let go of me! What the hell is happening, Nishipadma? What's... Rubbish! Hmmph! Go after him! You must get him to talk about Bhupati's murder and jujitsu. -Don't wait, go-- -Money, first. What for? I've already paid you. You made me mug up a poem. You think that's for free? I need extra money for that. All you care about is money! Damn it! He has gone so far. Here. Take it. Go, go, go! (humming) Hurry up! Uff! I don't believe it. Whatever he might be, I'll never believe he's a cheat. How long will you go on with false consolation, Sudha? You want proof? Very well. I will prove it to you. And I'll also show you what his job really is. -No, he can't cheat me-- -He is! He has been cheating you since day one. By hiding his real identity. You just refuse to understand. I'll send you a letter about when I can give you proof. Come see it if you have the guts. It repels me to even kill a person like him. Who was that man? Harimati failed to get any information too, then? Damn it! He isn't letting Harimati anywhere near him. Such a difficult man he is! -Didn't you find anything in the notebook? -No, Watson. It's full of rubbish. That sneaky man hasn't written anything about jujitsu and Bhupati. So none of your assumptions turned out to be true? Who's the detective? You, sir. Who will decide what's right or wrong? You. That bastard is the murderer! God cannot be so unjust to me. -No, I must find clues. Watson? -Yes? -I will find clues. -Where are you going? Gone case... (indistinct chatter) Uff! I'll look into it. What's wrong with Mahim, Hutashon? He isn't spending much time at office. Has he heard that the commissioner is angry with him? Even if his ears have heard it, his head hasn't registered it. There's a short circuit in his brain. And his head might just explode if the wires aren't fixed soon. He still can't stop running after that man, huh? No. Why don't you all try to make him understand? What is he looking for in this notebook? Jujitsu moves! This is that man's notebook. He has completely lost it. "Sincerely, your Professor... Arunabho Chattopadhyay." Hutashon. -Hutashon! -Coming, sir. Yes, sir? What's more dear to you, Hutashon? Mahim? Or your job? What's the matter? I want an answer. Why, just why? Why is it taking you so much time to do this simple task? At the hostel... With so many people around... it's not possible. I know that the students are away on vacation. Actually, you can't. You won't be able to do it. A government detective... is so close at hand, right under your nose. And your hands tremble to shoot him? Really? It disgusts me to call you a student of Arunabha Chattopadhyay. That's right. You didn't have to come here, Professor. I was compelled to come. I don't want to listen to anything else, Manmatha. I want the news of detective Mahimchandra shot dead. And from you. Keep that in mind. Do whatever it takes to prepare your mind for it. Manmatha wants to kill me. Bravo, you true blue Bengali! Hail to thee, Mother! -Hail to thee, Mother! -Hail to thee, Mother! Hail to thee, Mother! -Hail to thee, Mother! -Hail to thee, Mother! Hail to thee, Mother! -Hail to thee, Mother! -Hail to thee, Mother! I can't do it! I can't do it. I just can't. Professor... Give me any other task and I'll do it but... But I can't kill anyone. -What's the problem? -Morality. The problem lies in morality, Professor. Morality. Morality is a childish notion. Whatever you do to fulfill your goal is morally right. And if you talk about morality... Was making Sudhamukhi suspicious of her husband's character... ...morally right in any way? You know very well, Manmatha. It is only to get closer to you... that Mahimchandra is using Harimati as a bait. He is not at all attracted to Harimati. Using him as a bait... Or poisoning Sudhamukhi's mind to break up her family... Where's the morality here? Even morality has to be moulded to suit circumstances, Manmatha. Does Sudhamukhi believed it? Not yet. She will. Once the seeds of suspicion are sown in a woman's mind... it's only a matter of time before the cracks start to appear. No. In order to awaken dormant volcanoes like you... Sudhamukhi should be asked to join the group back. Why this sudden change of heart? The fire of her youth... used to weaken our group. This blow will subdue the fire. And it will be replaced... by a fire of vengeance. What exactly are you trying to say, Professor? Hmm. I'm thinking about something else. If Sudhamukhi... leaves her family... breaks her marriage... and joins our group... I'll get the old Manmatha back, right? Is this even possible... Professor? It's possible. Everything is possible for the country. Listen carefully to what I say. Manmatha? -Oh, Nishipadma. Tell me. -I need a word with you. After a lot of trouble, I managed to shift Harimati's interest from you to me. We were planning to go for a picnic this Saturday. -Great! -Please come along with us. -Me? -Yes. -Very well. -Great! -Excuse me. -Yes? I was thinking if I take my lover along too. Oh, wonderful! Why should one journey have different goals? Let us both meet there with our beloveds. Then let's see what happens. -Then it's decided. -Absolutely. I offered the bait myself, Watson. Can you imagine? Can you imagine... that a talented criminal like Manmatha and a freedom fighter like Arunabha Chattopadhyay... are planning to murder me. They're planning to murder detective Mahimchandra. I'm... I'm feeling so proud right now. Sir, please let the commissioner know. -Don't risk your life like this. -Don't you dare tell him. Don't say a word to anyone. Watson, I won't get an opportunity like this again. A duel between a skilled criminal and a detective by the Ganges. This Saturday. Please be there, Watson. I don't like unraveling mysteries without you. You'll be there, won't you? Be there, my friend. Don't say a word to anyone. Where are you going? -Sir? -"Be patient in faith." -Sir? -"Be courageous in action." -Where are you going, sir? -"Hold you head high." -Have you lost your mind? -"Have no fear." Sudhamukhi. Letter for you. That man dropped it in the letter box this afternoon. I'm not educated. But the contents of the letter... is quite clear to me. I heard everything, Sudhamukhi. What did you get by stifling your feelings like this? You know... Before my marriage... I was in love with someone too. But my father forced me to marry someone else. And this is my condition now. Sudhamukhi, I couldn't do it. But you can do it. Go, Sudhamukhi. Go! -What are you saying, Sneha? -I'm saying what's right. Don't stifle your feelings like this. It's a sin to stifle your feelings! Go, Sudhamukhi. You should go. Please go away, Sneha. Leave me alone. Come, get off. Come. There you go! I need double payment today. -Let me make that clear. -Why are you always after money? Have you done what I asked you to? I'm trying my best. Look, if you don't like it, tell me. -I refuse to work and be insulted too. -Hey, wait! Why do you get angry? Look. Manmatha is here. Manmatha has reached. You come this side. Look who's here. It's Manmatha! There you are, Manmatha. Where were you? We've been waiting for so long. -So, where's your beloved? -Oh gosh! Why are you so concerned about his beloved? I'm simply a worshipper of beauty. If I must die, might as well be at the hands of a beautiful woman. What say, Manmatha? (carriage pullers humming) Shall I ask her to get off? Of course, why delay? Please do it. Come out. Why are you feeling shy? We are all worshippers of beauty. Remove the veil and show us your face. Hmm? Huh? Hey! Give that back. Your character and makeup are equally ridiculous. Give that back to me. Don't-- Don't tear these off. -Oh no! -I have to return them. Sudhamukhi, this is my disguise so I can catch Manmatha red-handed. And Harimati works at my office, I have no... I have nothing going on with her. Come on, tell her. I'm not in this anymore. I'm leaving. Where are you going? Wait! -But you took so much money. -I'll return it to you in office. -Trust me, this isn't true, Sudhamukhi. -But Manmatha is my real lover. From before my marriage. He couldn't forget me even after I got married. And I? I can tolerate my husband's neglect, I can tolerate his lies... But adultery? Wait, you can't say it all. I'm the detective, let me say it. So let me start. Tell me, Sudhamukhi. Manmatha used to hover around our house to see you, isn't it? Mahim. You are lucky that you've got a wife like her. Yes. Yes. It's true that... I tried to contact Sudhamukhi after her marriage. Come with me, Sudhamukhi. I'll deal with whatever happens. That's not possible, Manmatha. My husband has committed no crime. I can't deceive him. Then you won't listen to anything I say? Why are you worried about what people will say, Sudha? Why do you tell me the same thing, Manmatha? Then promise me something. I will stand in front of your house every evening. Light a lantern and... come to your south-facing balcony once. I want to see you once every day, Sudhamukhi. Don't deny me this little bit of joy. Brilliant! From what I understand, this is a very complex case. Exactly the kind I've always wanted. Superb! Very nice. Bravo, Manmatha! Bravo! You really are talented. You set up a crime scene at a detective's house. Extremely complex case. And I was worried about jujitsu and Bhupati. Brilliant! An exceedingly complex case. Sudhamukhi... You're right. I'm not worthy of you. You should go with Manmatha. Yes, she will. She will. Who is this? I won't let Sudha waste all her life with a sexless person like you. But before she leaves... she will kill the enemy of the country herself. Arunabha Chattopadhyay! -Gopal? -Don't you dare try to run away. Police? How did the police get here? You are under arrest. -Mahim, did you inform the police? -Me? No, I mean... I can't really understand what's going on. I didn't call the police-- Wait, wait. I'll look into it. Gopal? Watson? What are you doing here? -What's the matter? -Mahim, it's the commissioner's order. Arrest each of them. Arrest? How strange, Gopal. I'm busy with a personal case here. I'm trying to solve a very complex case and you're jumping in the middle of it! Rubbish! Watson. Take Gopal away. Go away! -Hail to thee, Mother! -What the hell are you doing? Sudha! Hutashon! We have to catch them. We must come back with the force. Mr. Detective. Get up. I know. I know that this is all a part of your plan. But no matter how much you plan... It's not so simple to catch Arunabha Chattopadhyay. -Me? -Shame on you! You've been hiding this from me all this while? The thing that I hate most in life... You do that for a living? You're a police detective? You conspire against and arrest freedom fighters like this? Ridiculous! All of you are blaming me... I am a detective. I only know criminals. I don't care who's a freedom fighter and who isn't. I do my work with integrity. I have not deceived anyone. -Don't you have any sense of morality? -No, I don't. -Have you no duty towards your country? -No, I don't. I have no sense of morality, nor any duty! My only duty is towards my detective work. I am a detective and that's my sole identity. Huh? What's this? Hutashon? Sudhamukhi. Take it. Finish the enemy of your country, Sudha. How can you say that, Professor? Do what I tell you. What's the matter? Take it. Drop the gun, Hutashon. You're making a mistake. You'll kill your senior officer? I will not kill you, Gopal. You'll be shot dead by Arunabha Chattopadhyay. That's what everyone will know. Prepare your mind. Take it. Sudha... -Professor, what are you doing? -Step aside, Manmatha. Shoot him, Sudhamukhi. Sudha! Listen to me, Sudha. Don't make this mistake. You can never achieve anything by killing someone. Sudha. -Professor? Professor! -Shoot him, Sudhamukhi. -Professor. -Keep quiet, Manmatha. -Shoot him! -No, Sudha, don't. So many innocent, non-violent young people... have been framed by you and handed over to the police as terrorists, Gopal. You have murdered so many of them in jail. Only for your personal grudge. And then you spread rumours among the rebels... That Mahim was the one at fault? Shame on you, Gopal! You call yourself human? Why are you thinking so much? Shoot him, Sudhamukhi. Sudha! Sudha! Sudha! Don't do this, Sudha. Give the gun to me. This is like a live detective novel, Sudhamukhi. If this is a dream, please don't wake me up. Go on, shoot me. -Shoot him, Sudhamukhi! -Yes, go on. -Professor! Don't let her shoot him. -Shoot me. Give me the gun. I'll shoot him. -Shoot him, Sudhamukhi. -Sudha, don't do it. -Don't shoot him, Sudha. -Shoot him! Wait, Hutashon. You're forgetting what our job is all about. We are spies, Gopal. It's our job to betray. But even spies have mutual trust in each other. You have broken that trust. A person like you has no right to live. No! Forgive me, Hutashon. -Shoot him, Sudhamukhi! -Let go! Shoot me. -Professor! You are forcing her. -Shut up! Sudhamukhi. Think about all those who have been martyred... They, whom you called your brothers. This man is responsible for each hanging. You can't have any weakness for him. You'll have his blood on you all your life, Sudha. "Never be motivated by the results of your actions. Nor be attached to not performing your duties". -Do your duty. Shoot me. -No... What's wrong? You're not holding the gun right. Let me... What's the problem? Should I show you how? Sudha! Hail to thee, Mother! Hail to thee, Mother! Hail to thee, Mother! -Hail to thee, Mother! -Sudha... I killed him. -Hail to thee, Mother! -Sudha. Manmatha, I killed him. -Sudha. -Hail to thee, Mother! I killed him, Manmatha. Sudha. We have to get away from here. We can't stay here. The police is here, let's go. Come Sudha, get up. Stand up. Get up. Let's go. -I killed him... -Let's leave, Sudha. How did I kill him, Manmatha? Sir? What happened to you? What a disaster! Sir? Sir? Sir? Oh God. Must get him to the hospital. Is anyone there? He has to be take to the hos-- Huh? Sir, you're alive? -Who's the detective, Watson? -You, sir. Then? Look at this. I had made this with great hopes. Finally, it came to good use. -Did you always wear it when you went out? -No! Why would I wear it all the time? -Manmatha wanted to kill me, remember? -Hmm. I always wanted this, you know. A criminal would shoot at me and I'd survive because of this vest. -Exactly like in detective novels. -Yes. Finally, my dream was fulfilled by my wife. Oh, it's a day of great joy, Watson! -But that man escaped with your wife, sir. -Huh? -Let them go. -What? For once at least, I did the right thing, in my wife's opinion. Say what you will but... Constantly investigating the twisted minds of criminals... has made me quite a skilled criminal too. Isn't it, Watson? Didn't you love your wife, sir? -Sir? -Hmm? It's for the best, Watson. She'll be happy and... I will be fine too. The more I see you, the more I am amazed. Isn't it? I am amazed too! Oh, wait. Hold this. There you go. -Return these. -Yes, sir. -Let's go. -Where? Don't we have a new case to solve? Let's go! -But really, Watson. -Yes? -There's no fear if I have this on me. -It's brilliant! -Do you want one? -I wouldn't mind it, sir. -Hey! Wait. -What now? Careful. Is anyone there, sir? -Softly. -No, no one there. -All clear. Come on. -Phew! Let's go.
