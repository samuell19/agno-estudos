(INDISTINCT CHATTER) (GIGGLING) GIRL: Great! I'll bring you some. Come on. Before it gets cold. April. April. EMMA: I was fourteen in the year of that long summer of 1942. The summer of a war that had scarcely touched us. We didn't feel threatened in any way. And the land itself... Lazy and slow under the dry and seductive sun... Was indifferent to conflict. My father had been away for many months. But except for his absence, the world he'd left behind remained unchanged. Do you recall any-- Remember. It's "Do you remember an inn, Miranda?" "Do you remember an inn, Miranda? "Do you remember an inn? "And the tedding and the spreading of the straw for the bedding, "and the fleas that tease in the... "High... "High... "Pyrenees. "High Pyrenees." ANNE: Emma, Laurel, come on, we have to go. Come on, girls. If you don't come now it will get dark by the time we get back. Come on now, just quiet down. You are getting over excited. ANNE: Come on, in you get. Did we leave it as we found it? BOTH: Yes. (TURNS RADIO ON) (SONG PLAYS IN BACKGROUND) GIRLS: April! Come on. GIRL: I spy with my little eye something beginning with 'F'. Fingers... flowers... No. (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) I'm having another go. No. ANNE: Hush, now I want to listen to the news. RADIO: We have suffered some attacks on Rabaul. and other bases at which Australian airmen and crews are stationed... Be quiet, I am trying to listen to this. Such attacks must be regarded as inevitable, as war operations develop. Mr. Drakeford announced that Rabaul had an air raid alert at midday on Saturday... But no attack developed. RAAF activities in the Pacific since the war with Japan... (CAR ENGINE REVVING) Bombing and machine gun attacks on enemy attacks on enemy aircraft, transports, cruisers and submarines... (BIRDS CHIRPING) LAUREL: Mummy? Um-hmm... Why do the Japanese eat babies? (CHUCKLES) Who in the world told you that? One of the girls at school. Well, she was making it up. Of course they don't eat babies. Anyway... Ordinary people don't start the wars, they just get... sucked in. Why? Well... They don't have much choice, most of them. Why did daddy go to New Guinea? Oh well, they made him go. LAUREL: Who did? Um... The men in charge. What men though? Not now darling, I have to concentrate here. (DOG BARKING) (SHIP HORN BLOWS) Be a good girl. Don't forget to give the flowers to Miss Arnott. Off you go. If I can get more petrol coupons, we'll have another picnic on Sunday. EMMA: Now, don't be silly. Of course mummy didn't want to send us away. LAUREL: Then why did she? Most of kids are here because their mum's are doing war work and their dad's are away. You know that. I suppose. Anyway, this is not like most boarding schools, is it. At least there are boys here. You didn't brush your hair, did you? No. I'll do it for you. (SHIP SIREN SOUNDS) Come on, Ethel, come on. (DOG BARKING) (SHIP SIREN SOUNDS) (TURNS RADIO ON) Now, generally speaking, do you find the women engaged in war production, enjoy the work? I'm sure, in certain cases they do. Everybody has some one in the forces and they're doing war work, you know. And they are helping him in his task to win this war. And feels she is doing something really worthwhile. (SONG PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND) EMMA: I never thought about my mother's world or her life apart from us? And she never complained. If she had, I probably wouldn't have listened or understood. Because I was too caught up in my own world and she didn't enter into it. She was lonely of course. But I never realized quite how lonely. (SONG PLAYING IN BACKGROUND) Hi Jane, hi its me. Yeah, how are you? Oh, yeah, well... I just wondered if you... and Phil would like to come over for a meal tonight. Yeah, tonight. (RADIO PLAYING IN BACKGROUND) Okay, no, no, no... Another night, it's okay. Bye. (CAT MEOWING) Who is it? Anne Grange. (TV PLAYING) The usual, dear? Yes, please. A bottle. MRS. MORTIMER: I told you I didn't want to see you again. Can I have a bottle of port, Mrs. M. MRS. MORTIMER: Who let you in? I can pay you, Mrs. Mortimer. Well, you can pay what you owe me. 26 bobs, all right? MRS. MORTIMER: No singing, I don't tolerate singing, OLD WOMAN: Thanks, love, you are a good sport. MRS. MORTIMER: And don't spill on my floor. On your own dear? Yeah. I married him, I married him, as soon as my parents decided to go to the states. I was 20, he was 21. OLD WOMAN: Ah, a real love match, eh? ANNE: He was always on the beach. He was so brown, so handsome Then he came home from that bloody recruiting office and he said, "They have classified me A one-fit." And I thought I'm not gonna let them have him, I'm not gonna let them have him. I know what I'll do, I'll cut off one of his toes. They would never take him with a gammy foot. Wouldn't take a cripple. Of course we couldn't do it. Wish we had it, it's been ages since we have seen him. He did the right thing though, dear. I know. ...fighting for his country. No, no, no, Frank's not fighting. He is an artist, they've made him official war artist. At least, he didn't have to kill anybody, thank god. What if the Japs come and rape you, huh? And butchered your kiddies? But why would they do that? I mean... They have got kids of their own. They are probably, you know-- No, no, no, they are savages. It's all that raw fish. It's no wonder. (ANNE LAUGHS) HANK: Can we buy you two ladies a drink? Oh! No, thank you. I'm going to go home. A port would be lovely, dear. One for the road? RADIO COMMENTATOR: And now, ladies and gentleman, your favourite radio personality, Mr. Keith Walsh. * I'll never dance again * What good it would do? * For tears would fill my eyes * My heart would feel barren * That our romance is through * I will never love again * I'm so in love with you * I'll never thrill again * To somebody new * Within my heart * I know I will never start * To smile again * Until I smile at you * (ANNE MOANS AND WEEPS) We complained about the school, but compared to most in Sydney, Ballantyne was a paradise. eccentric, exotic, cocooned, the perfect setting for my own world of day dreams and fantasies. The appeal of reason is more to the head But the penetration of the heart comes from suffering It opens up the inner understanding in man. Suffering is the badge of the human race not the sword. Emma. Emma! Ah, could you please pick up this speech, where I have left of, Emma? May I see your note? "As I stare into the bush, my heart is filled with love. "The sun, the tree, the singing birds, in joyous flocks above." Yeah. That is very good, Emma. Perhaps you might change "flock" to "flight". "In joyous flights, above", hm? Would you please read from page 122? We studied today Gandhi's speech, not English. To see the universal and all pervading spirit of truth face to face... one must be able to love the meanest of creations as oneself..." (MRIDANGAM PLAYS) (CHILDREN GIGGLE AND CHATTER) We are very honoured to have with us today, from India, Doctor Raj Shah and his daughter Sahdra Shar-da... Sharda who is going to dance for us in a moment. Unless, perhaps, first Doctor Shaw would like to say a few words? No, thank you very much, thank you. No? Well then we await the story of Vishnu and the lady who loved him (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Gosh, my bosom hurts. I'll have to get a bra soon. Anyway you are not quite flat as Emma. She hasn't even got her period yet. I'm 32 inches. My nipples are quite big. Anyway, Rita Hayworth is only 36. Come now, children, hurry, You're wasting all the hot water. One, two, wash all the sand out, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That's good. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. "How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank "Here we will sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ear. "Soft stillness and nights become the touches of sweet harmony" Sit, Jessica. "Look how the floor of heaven "is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold "there's not the smallest orb thou behold'st "but in it's motion like an angel sings "still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins "such a harmony is in immortal souls "but while this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in" (MISS ARNOTT SIGHS) We cannot hear it. How on earth could a village bumpkin like Shakespeare write that? It doesn't seem likely or even remotely possible. I have a book on the subject. I must lend it to your father. He is away at the war, Mrs. Arnott. Your father you know has the light. I think you have the light, too, Emma. Oh, no, Miss Arnott. Why ever not, child? Don't you want to become a Knight? Sir Lancelot? I suppose so, if I could. And you, David, you shall be Sir Galahad. It's Brian, Miss Arnott. MISS ARNOTT: Of course, dear boy. Such dear children All doing your best for the war effort. War effort! Slave labour is more like it. God, I'm sick of vegetables, We'll probably all die of carrot disease or celeryitis. Do you like me? No. Not even a bit? I don't know. Well, look under the bell, before assembly. (BELL TOLLS) (EMMA PANTS) I think he loves me. Do you love him? Of course, not. He does look bit like Tyrone power, though, doesn't he? A bit. He's quite good looking, too short for you, though. Good morning, girls. (TENOR SINGS OPERA ON GRAMOPHONE) (EVERYONE RECITES IN UNISON) I am a link in the golden chain of love. which stretches around the world. (GIRLS GIGGLING) I must keep my link right and strong for use in the master's service. It smells like pine soap. Yeah. It'll be good when it rains won't it? Hey, are we going to sneak up here after midnight and sleep here? Are you game to come? I hope Brian doesn't ask me to dance. Maybe he will ask you? No, he won't do that, he hasn't spoken to me. (CHILDREN CHATTER AND GIGGLE) Quiet please. Do be quiet. I'm now going to demonstrate the waltz with, ah, let me see. Yes. David. David? It's Brian, Miss Arnott Just so. Advance, dear boy. And straighten your tie. That's right. Yes now, ready? One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. Lead, David, lead. Come of the others of you, Don't be shy. (CHILDREN GIGGLE) One, two, three. One, two, three. You are doing very well, David. Would you care to dance, Emma? One, two, three. One, two, three. You dance very well, Emma, You have... You have a natural feeling for the music. My father says I have two left feet. You know something? I miss my father too. Emma, would you... would you keep a secret do you think. Yes, all right. Good. Miss Gunz and I are engaged. We wish... we wish you alone should know this, because you are very special friend. * When a boy from Alabama * Meets a girl from Gundagai * Winter turn in to spring and the birds start to sing * A sweet lullaby * When a boy from Alabama * I... I love you. I love you. (CHILDREN GIGGLE) (GIGGLES) Hey, look its a Frenchie. A contraceptive. It's a balloon. (CHILDREN LAUGH IN DISGUST) Disgusting. He's been doing it all his life. Will you give me a kiss. No. Just one. I don't want to. It's a bit uncomfortable, I think I will go back. Well, all right. Will you give me a kiss at the end of the term. EMMA: On one of our Sunday outings. we happened to go to the war memorial. It only reminded me of my dead grandfather. And I couldn't associate it, with my living father in any way. All I wanted was to escape from it's chill, back in to the warmth of the sun. (BELL TOLLS) (BELL TOLLS) Don't stare. All the American men look like film stars. EMMA: Oh, they look so nice in their uniforms. I hope I grow up before the war's over. Come on, darling, don't dawdle, I've got to get you back to school. Pages, enter the chamber. Link the companions with ceremonial cord. To the glory of the god and the service of the king. To the glory of the god and the service of the king. The following children are now to be made squires of the Order of the Knights of the round table They are... Louise Cudlipp Helen Quick and Emma Grange. Through the determined development of character you have followed the path to enlightenment and the ultimate goal, nirvana. May you continue in the master's service. I dub thee squire of the Knights of the round table, with this sword. Excalibur. Rise squire and remember, Emma, If you continue to improve you shall become a knight What will you have? Oh, I wouldn't mind a beer. Sure? Got one here. Sure. There you go. HANK: What do I owe you? MISS MORTIMER: Ten bob, I'll be fine. MISS MORTIMER: Ta. HANK: Thank you. Ah, mind if I join you? No. Thank you. Where's your friend tonight? Oh, he is confined to the ship. Hey, you know, Sydney is a real nice town. It's a lot like home. Where's home? San Francisco. This is the first furlough, I've had in months, you know that? I was born in San Francisco. My parents came over here when I was 15. ANNE: What did you do there? HANK: Oh, I am a... I am a violinist. You are not. second violinist in the symphony orchestra. Well I was you know, now I am just one of god's own boys. ANNE: Really? Yeah, really. You like music? Yeah. There's a concert in the park tonight. Hey, why don't we go? I think I would really enjoy it. All right. All right. We'd have to hurry... Okay. All right, then. RADIO COMMENTATOR: That was moonlight serenade played by Joe loss and his orchestra. War work? What kind of war work? Oh, learning to be a fitter and a turner and painting camouflage on A,P,C's God, I hate all that ugly brown and green, the din of the machines, It's enough to drive you nuts, to say nothing of the chatter of woman's voices. I swear, I think woman without men are worse than the other way around. Oh, I doubt it. Well I'm sorry you don't want to listen to me complaining about life on shore. Are you married? No, no, but I have got a steady girl back home. Well, I have been married for nearly 18 years. You're kidding. You are not. (CHUCKLES) Frank, my husband, is an artist. Quite a well thought of one, really, although you wouldn't have heard of him yet in the states. But you will. Is he away? Oh, yeah. In the army? Uh-huh, yeah. He was a Gunner, but then they offered him a commission as an official war artist. (SIGHS) Miss him a lot. My two girls, two girls in Theosophist Boarding School. Theosophist? Hey, why that? Yeah. Well, because Frank and I are both atheist, you see. So, we decided that we would just let them study all the religions and they could decide what they wanted to be. Emma wants to be a Catholic one week, Hindu the next-- Yeah, I went through a Buddhist phase when I was 19. (CHUCKLES) Boarding school's all... If it weren't for the war never have them there, but... (BREATHES DEEP) Hey, you know, war is tough on everybody. Yeah. That's the truth. Say, Anne, uh, it's still pretty early. Why don't we get a few more drinks? Oh, yes, let's. Let's go ahead. (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) (BOTH LAUGHING) Oh! (GIGGLES) Hey, I am so tired, I'll just go to sleep. (PANTS) Just go to sleep. Hey. Hey, come on now. What? You can't lie down here. Why not? I got to see you to your door, like a gentleman. Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES) Oh, yeah. Okay, wait a minute. (GRUNTING) Hey, you... Do you really play the violin? (LAUGHS) You bet I do. Oh, wait a minute. Come on, you're doing fine. Just a second. Here you go. Okay. Here you go. (GIGGLES) What? You mind if I stay for a while? No. 'Cause I like you. Nothing else, okay? Okay. Okay. Oh! Oh, my bed! (GRUNTS) (PANTS) (EXCLAIMS) My shoes... (BOTH LAUGH) Oh. Could you take my jacket? Oh, God. (SIGHS) Uh-huh. (MOANS) Oh, no, no. No, no. You promised. I love my husband. I'm faithful to my husband. Don't do that. Sure I know. Are my kids all right? Did they go back to school? You were alone when I met you, Anne. I... Where? We went to the concert. Don't you remember? Oh, yes. Yes. (SIGHS) I better go, I guess. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Stay. Just stay, so nothing happens. (SIGHS) I just want to be close. I haven't been close to anyone in so long. It's nice. (WATER SPLASHING) (SIREN BLARING) What's that? What's... (GUNS FIRING) (GASPS) (DISTANT EXPLOSION) (EXCLAIMS) Dear, God. Okay, listen. I got to get back to my ship. (GUNS FIRING) MAN ON RADIO: Three Japanese midget... Yes, I know it is, and I'm really really sorry to be willing you at this hour, but, I've made up my mind. I wanna pick them up in an hour. MAN ON RADIO: All have been destroyed... Sorry. No I really don't think I'm over reacting. I mean, no place in the harbour will be safe. Yeah. Thank you very much. MAN ON RADIO: ...crack of machine gun fire could be heard. The din was added to by the dropping of the depth charges. The detonation shook houses, and broke windows. I don't understand your worries, my dear. Death comes to us all, you know. We can't avoid it, no matter what we do. Yes, well, I'm sure that's true, Ms. Arnott, but, uh, all the same, I'd just like to put it off as long as possible. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye, my dears. Good-bye, Ms. Arnott. Good-bye, Ms. Arnott. Come on. (FROG CROAKING) I didn't even get a chance to say good-bye to my friends. I might never see them again. Ever. And I didn't get to tell anyone in the factory, but... We had to get out of Sydney, we might have all been killed. Being killed is like going to sleep. (CHUCKLES) It's all very well for Ms. Arnott, she's an old woman. And she believes in reincarnation. Only wish I did. EMMA: I resented our flight to the mountains, because I knew that it was an end to our long and private peace. War had finally disrupted our lives. (FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING) And I rebelled against mine being dictated to by events over which I had no control. (SLOW GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING) Come on, April. Come on. (APRIL PANTING) Come on, April. (BARKING) Well, it was really nice of aunt Helen to give it to us in the first place. And it's only for a little while, just till it's safe to go back to Sydney. Come on. (WIND BLOWING) EMMA: Bye, mum. LAUREL: Bye, mum. Come on. (SLOW MUSIC PLAYING) God! (SIGHS) Attention. Salute. Stand at ease. Now, Miss Clewes has something to say to you all. Pay attention. Good morning, children. CHILDREN: Good morning, Miss Clewes This week we have a number of new pupils up from Sydney, because of the Japanese raid. Try to settle in as quickly as possible without disturbing the rest of the school. Welcome. Now, we have to move onto something serious. Gas mask drill... (CHILDREN GIGGLE) ...which isn't an excuse for chatter. Kevin McDonald, did you hear what I said? Ready? Masks on. (GIGGLES) I know you haven't got a mask, child, but there's no excuse to stand there gawking. You can cover your face with your hands. Well, go on. MALE TEACHER: You, boy. Yes. You without the mask. Cain. (APRIL BARKING) It's horrible. Well, first day is bound to be bit difficult after Ballantyne, but... But they hate us. Nonsense. Who does? The teachers. Oh. Everybody. And they use the cane. They do? One girl got the cane just for talking. She got six cuts. I want to go back to Ballantyne. Well, you can't, you know. You just can't. Then I'm gonna kill myself. Emma, for gods sake. I'd soon as swallow arsenic and die of agony than go back there everyday. Will you stop that nonsense. Now, this isn't easy for any of us. Make yourself useful. Set the table. Do as you're told. This on the sink please. Thank you. Nicely, please. Please. Are you game? Game to what? To argot. Where'd we go? Exploring. Where though? Down there. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Come on. Why are you so slow? I don't like the steep parts. It's slippery. It's perfectly safe, Laurel. The track goes all the way down-- (EXCLAIMS) LAUREL: Are you all right, Emma? I slipped. That's all. (BIRDS CHIRPING) LAUREL: I hope there's no snakes. Oh, look. Maple ponds and tadpoles. (SINGING FRERE JACQUES) (HUMMING FRERE JACQUES) (EMMA HOWLING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) * Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall * Humpty Dumpty had a great fall * All the kings horses and all the kings man * Couldn't fix Humpty together again * Emma, wait for me. I'm not as fast as you. There's no hurry. Anyway, we're lost. Ssh. Come on. (CRACKLES) Uh... You alone? No, no. Our father's just behind us. How far behind? Just back up the track. And he's got a big stick. (SCOFFS) Always someone with a big stick or a gun. Would you do us a favour? What? You haven't seen me, all right? But we have seen you. Yeah, that's right. EMMA: Are the police looking for you? I reckon. Next. Others. Did you run away? Yeah, sort of. EMMA: Is it something to do with the war? It is something to do with the war, isn't it? LAUREL: Did you rob a bank? Look, I... think it'd be better if you went back now. I'd be grateful if you didn't say anything. Are you sick? I'm all right. Are you a spy? Not even a spy. Would you like us to help you? We could bring you back some food this afternoon, if you'd show us the way back to Katoomba. There's a short-cut... That way. You, uh, you didn't tell anybody about me, did you? EMMA: No. But we had to be careful taking the food. LAUREL: It's all right. I can manage. That school. Won't they miss you? EMMA: We'll say we were sick. Sure your mum won't miss her rations? She might mention it. No she won't. Anyway, thanks. And thanks for the grub. (CHUCKLES) I'll bring some more tomorrow. Would you? Now, will you tell us why you're hiding? Laurel. I'm what they call a... Conscious objective. Consi for short. What's a consi? I wouldn't go into the army. Does that mean you're a traitor? Some people think so. But I think they're wrong. What do you think, Emma? But my dad had to go in. He didn't wanna go, but they made him. So he went. Were you afraid? (LAUGHS) Rather been blind to pieces here, any sane person would be. That's not the reason. I don't think it's very funny. Don't you love Australia? Don't you love your country? Yes, I do. Very much. I think it is very beautiful. So are lots of countries. I love the world, I'm part of the world. The world won't be worth living in it if we keep having wars. But Australia won't be worth living if we don't stop Hitler and the Japanese. Listen... Please, listen to me. The world is only beautiful as long as there are people here to see that it is beautiful. If you fight to the last man, to the last drop of blood, all that's left is a big pile of bodies. And all this... is just wasted. But the enemy doesn't feel like that. I can't, and I won't take up arms against another human being. That's all the enemy needs. Just ordinary human beings like you and me despite their propaganda. I believe I have the right not to kill people, and not to be turned into a murderer, and no one can take that right away from me. Does it make sense? I suppose. (GRUNTS) Hello. Taking the long way from school? No, we-- Yes. Where do you live? Over this street. Oh, I've got to go that way. Hop in. Oh, the last ones in. Hi. Hello. Hi. Hello. Hello. Would you like a little drink before you go? No, thank, Mrs. Got to finish my round. Oh, money. Hubby away, is it? Yes. In the army. Uh. They wouldn't take me. Deaf in one ear. Oh... But I wanted to go, like... But... Are you a consi? I know a consi. Liar. No fear. (WHISPERING) Don't tell. No, no. I don't go with all that bull. In-fact was my hearing. They wouldn't take me. I reckon they should string all them consis up. Uh-hmm. Cowards. I wanted to go. My oath. Take care of yourselves, girls. Bye. So... How was school today? Good. Aren't you a little late getting back? We saved a man who-- We went exploring. I was playing games and looking for a mantis. Can we listen to the wireless? Yes. (MUSIC PLAYING) (CHUCKLES) Em? What? Do you think he'll get cold? Who? John Doe in the cove. I really haven't thought about it. Are you really going down there tomorrow? Probably. Why? What if they ask where you were at school then? You go. Then they won't get suspicious. What will I say? Tell them I've had a hysterectomy. What's that? It's a terribly serious operation. What kind of operation? Something to do with the lungs. Go to sleep. (BIRDS CHIRPING) I've brought you some breakfast. Thanks. You're very kind. It's good. Do you like poetry? Hm. Read me that one. Out loud? Not if you don't want. "Now let the draughtsman Of my eyes be done "Marking the line of petal and of hill. "Let the long commentary of the brain be silent. "Evening and the earth are one, "and bird and tree are simple and stand still." Will you read them for me? "Tunnelling through the night the trains pass in a splendour of power, "with a sound like thunder shaking the orchards, "waking the young from a dream, "scattering like glass the old men's' sleep, "laying a black trail over the still bloom of the orchards, "the trains go north with guns. "Strange primitive piece of flesh, the heart laid quiet "hearing their cry pierce through its thin-walled cave "recalls the forgotten tiger. "Tiger, you walk through all our past and future, "troubling the children's sleep', "laying a reeking trail across our dreams of orchards." LAUREL: They asked me where you were at school today. I said you were sick, they said you'd have to bring a note. I'll forge one. You can't. Of course I can. Blue cattle. Who ever heard of blue cattle? He must be colour blind. ( EASY TO LOVE PLAYING) * You'd be * So easy to love * So easy to idolize * All others above * So worth the yearning for * So swell to keep every home fire burning for * (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) ANNE: And the city could probably get me some meat for the weekend if I come in early with the coupons. So if you like, we could have lamb. Would you like roast lamb? And roast potatoes. Think I'll make a move pretty soon. Today? Na, not today. but soon. Can't keep you out of school like this, or they'll be after you too. I don't care. I like to be with you. Where will you go? I don't know. Probably North. It happened at the divide, I'll have to see. But what would happen if they caught you? They'd put me back in jail. Been there twice already. It was, uh... I don't think I can take another stretch in jail. They wear you down, they guide you so you'll hit out. When you don't, they make your life... I don't know, I might, uh, join the ambulance core. At least I'd be saving lives, kind of. The whole things so bloody insane. You mustn't give up, John. You mustn't. I won't. What are you doing out of school? Wagging it, are you? Oh, no. I've been visiting a friend. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (GRUNTING) Country bastard, bloody poofter. (GRUNTS) Come on, that's enough, John. Get up and fight, you bloody coward. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING) (RAIN PATTERING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) ANNE: Emma, come on, get up. You'll be late for school. Do you have a pain? No, I just don't feel well. Well, you must be. You looked awfully pale when you came home from school yesterday. I'll have the doctor look after you, huh. I don't need a doctor. I'll be all right if I just stay in bed for a while. Are you sure you're not doing this just to stay home from school? Mum. You're not in trouble at school? Mum. All right. Laurel, hurry up, honey. Don't forget your raincoat. (SIGHS) (THUNDER RUMBLING) Oh! What's that you're reading? Poetry? Feeling better? I don't know. Hm. Then, what are you doing up? Don't pick on me. I'm not picking on you. I mean, if you're up... you must be feeling better. So, why don't you make yourself... Oops. Useful. Do these dishes. Washing up? But why? I don't want any arguments, Emma. But it's not my turn, it's Laurels turn. I decide who's turn it is. Not gonna ask you again. Why always pick on me? I'm not picking on you! You just mourn around this house in a dream all day, and expect me to wait on you hand and foot, and I'm sick of it! I'm sick of it! You just get up. Get over here to the sink right away and do what you're told. It's not my fault we have to live in this horrible place. I hate it, and I hate you. You're a drinking cow. How dare you speak to me like that! (CRYING) (SOBBING) (SIGHS) Jesus. (SIGHS) (BELL RINGS) Huh? (DOG BARKING) (GRUNTS) (BELL RINGS) God. (PANTING) Yes. Mrs. Grange? Uh-huh. I'm Miss Clewes. I'd like a word with you about your daughter Emma. Oh... Yes, all right. Yes, come in. Thank you. Can I have your coat. Thank you. Thank you. (CLEARS THROAT) This way. I'm afraid I had no idea, Miss Clewes. Is the child here now? Yes. Yes, she is. Then, perhaps we should confront her with it. Confront? Tell her to come in. I'll question her about where she's been. Oh, I'm afraid I can't do that, Miss Clewes. Can't? Or won't, Mrs. Grange? Well, Emma's sick in bed, I couldn't possibly disturb her. Sick? Hm. I see. I'm sure you are aware that the matter doesn't end here, Mrs. Grange. Thank you very much for coming, Miss Clewes. That was, uh... Miss Clewes. She said you've been missing school. Is that true? Emma? What is it? Have you been missing school? Tell me. Oh, God, how could you. I... I know you don't like living here, and I know you don't like that school, but... We all have to put up with things that we don't like when the war's on and... I know. I don't... I don't like being away from home either. And I don't like living without daddy. (SLOW GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING) We have each other, haven't we? You and... Laurel and I, I mean, we can cheer each other up, eh? So, no... So, no more missing school, okay? Promise? Promise. (SIGHS) I'm sorry, mum. Really I am. (CRYING) I know. I already know. (BLOWS WHISTLE) (COCK CROWING) Oh. Letter from daddy. Girls! Letter from daddy. LAUREL: Let me see it. I wanna read it. Let me look. He's coming home! How long for? When is he coming? How long for? Oh, no! He's... He's been hurt. His Jeep was blown up. Uh, uh... Oh, but he thinks he'll be home by the 15th! Oh, he's coming home! Oh... It's so hot. I'm dizzy. Would you like a glass of Sherry, mum? No. No thank you, darling. But I would love a cup of tea. Just top that up, would you. Let's see. Read a little louder. Uh-hm. This bits private. You look lovely, mum. (CHUCKLES) Oh, darling, could you hand me those stocking in there. In that box. Stockings, mum? Yes. (CHUCKLES) My last pair. I've been saving them. (DOG BARKING) LAUREL: Infantry here, mum. It's here. Oh! LAUREL: Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Oh, daddy. (CHUCKLES) Oh! Oh, it's so good to see you. (MUSIC PLAYING ON THE RADIO) EMMA: For the first and only time since we've been up the mountains, we went into the town for dinner to its one glamorous restaurant. WOMEN: Your table's ready, sir. EMMA: It wasn't what we'd hoped for. We were all nervous. So anxious to celebrate my fathers return that perhaps we expected too much of the occasion. I felt sorry for him. And now, for my mother. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) Thank you. Has the wine waiter come yet? FRANK: Not yet. ANNE: They'll starve. WAITER: Some wine with your meal, sir? Oh, good. That-- Champagne. Yes. Yes. Champagne. Champagne. I'll see if we have some chilled. Look, they've got your favourite, Hams filled with beef. Or shouldn't we try Fun Jelly? A drop for each of the children. Welcome home, darling. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (GASPS) It's all right. It doesn't hurt. Doesn't any more. (SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING) Yes, you do. Would you like a... (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) LAUREL: Are we going shopping today? Aren't we? Uh, yes. I, I think so. (SCREAMS) (MUSIC PLAYING ON THE RADIO) There. And one more thing. What's this? Claret. You could start, girls. Used up all my, my coupons for the lamb. It's all right. FRANK: It's wonderful. (MOUTHING) FRANK: (MOANS) Oh, darling. (ANNE MOANING) (FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING) (CHUCKLES) Must have gone off. Thanks, Em. Aren't you supposed to be at school today? It's Saturday. Is it? Hm. (GROANS) That sun's lovely. Would you like me to bring you your drawing box? Um, no thanks, Em. Em? Yes. It'll be all right. I know that, daddy. (DOG BARKING) (BOTH GRUNT) That's a bear. That is very good. Will you draw me a cow? A cow? What colour? You choose. Well, browns a little bit dull, isn't it? What about a blue cow with pink spots? EMMA: My father seemed relaxed and happy enough. But I sensed that perhaps the tensions was still there. Beneath the surface. It's no good. I can't work here. The lights all wrong. There's just not enough room! Well, why don't you just... take a rest for now and try again later. Yeah. What do you say to us moving back to Sydney? Japs, or no Japs, I need to get back to my studio. I'll be able to work there. I know I will. It'd be better for all of us, I know it would. We're all unhappy here. Our flat is free, isn't it? Uh-huh. Yeah, it's free. I had a friend staying there before, but, she's gone now. Oh, yes! Do let's go. Wait till I tell the girls, they'll be so excited. EMMA: Our return to Sydney began a long slow process of healing. At first my father shunned the outside world and withdrew to the emotional safety of his studio, where he protected himself with work. I was his willing model. And over the next year I saw his confidence gradually return. In this way he recorded with tenderness and approval the fact of my growing up. The war in Europe ended, but that was miles away. At home we longed for our own peace. I passed my entrance to art school on the day we heard that the Japanese were about to surrender. (HORN TOOTING) It was a wonderful way to start a new life. (HORN TOOTING) (BELLS DINGING) (HORN TOOTING) (PEOPLE CHEERING) (WHISTLING) (DRUMS AND BASS MUSIC PLAYING) (BAND MUSIC PLAYING) John! John? John? (FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING) (SOFT GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING)
