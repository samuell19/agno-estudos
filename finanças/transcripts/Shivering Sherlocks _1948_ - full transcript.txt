And we'll see that you get a nice send-off. Shut up. That's a lie detector. STOOGES: Oh, not that. Oh, no. There's one thing... Here, hold that. If you tell the truth, that pen'll travel in a straight line, but, if ya tell a lie, we'll know it. Have you ever been in jail before? LARRY: Why, of course not. (MACHINE BEEPING) CAPTAIN: That's a lie. Just as I thought. Have you any visible means of support? Sure. I got suspenders. (CHUCKLING) So you have. - (THWACK) - Oh! I mean, have you guys got a job? Why, certainly, Captain. We work in the, er... At the Elite Cafe on Main Street. - Check on that, Jackson. - Yes, sir. - (CRUNCHING) - Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Hold that. Now, then. I got a couple of questions I wanna ask you. - Me? - Yes, and so have I. Did you or did you not take that quarter out of my shoe last night? On my honour, Moe, I didn't do it. (BEEPING) Oh, whoa! Oh, a chisel, eh? That's enough. Break it up. Now, then. What were you doing at eleven o'clock last night? I dunno. What were you doin' at eleven o'clock? Er... I was at a Lodge meeting. (MACHINE BEEPING LOUDLY) The last question seems to have broken the machine, Captain. What's that? We didn't do it, Captain. - You're wastin' our time. - (SQUELCH) - (STOOGES GASPING) - Come back here! MOE: Gee, it was swell of ya to tell the cops we worked here, Miss Harmon. Yeah. If it wasn't for you, we'd be sent up for life. You sure got us out of a jam. Oh, that's all right, boys. I'm sort of in a jam, myself. Yeah? What's the trouble? Oh, tryin' to make a go of this restaurant. I can't afford any help, and most of my customers sign their cheques instead of paying. You mean, they sign all these? - Mm-hmm. - Why, the dirty chisellers. Who are they? "Larry Fine, Larry Fine, La..." - (THWACK) - Why, you nitwit! You got a lot of crust, you have. I wonder whose this is. "Shemp Howard, Shemp Howard, Shemp..." - (HARD SLAP) - What's the matter with you? I'm comin' right back. Hey, this guy must've had a tapeworm. Who? "Moe Howard, Moe Howard, Moe How..." (GASPING) What are you guys lookin' at? - (HARD SLAPS) - Get outta here. Miss Harmon, you got yourself three new helpers. Yeah, and for free, too. Oh, boys, I couldn't let you do anything like that. Oh, forget it. Spread out. You go into the kitchen. - You get behind that counter. - Oh, really, you shouldn't. That's all right, Miss Harmon. They're gonna go to work and like it. And, if it's absolutely necessary, I'll go to work, too. We're out of almost everything. Then, you run along to the market and stock up. We're in business! What'll it be, sir? I'll take the short ribs. I think we got some delicious chicken soup. Just short ribs. I know, but you haven't tried our chicken soup. I know, because... Short ribs! Short ribs. Chicken soup, comin' up! One chicken soup, comin' up. Mmph! (CRASHING) Nice, fresh chicken, too. Fresh cackle soup, comin' up. (YELLING) (HISSING) Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! LARRY: Fry two, over easy.

Why, you... - (CLATTERING) - Cut it out, now, Moe. - No, no, no! - (THUD) - (THUD) - Oh! - Why, you... - Shut up. Don't... Whoa, whoa! I'm sorry, sir. Why, Captain Mullins, how are ya? (GIGGLING) Funny thing, I was just thinkin' about you. Yeah, and I'm thinkin' about you right now. And it could be murder! - Now, don't get excited, Cap. - Yes, sit right down. - Have somethin' on the house. - Yeah, yeah, have somethin' on the house! Right back here. Sit down. Out of the draught. Now, how about some nice vittles? Chicken soup? Cereals? Here you are, Cap'n. Nice cup of hot java. What's on your mind? D'you ever see that guy before? Hey, that's one of the guys was in on the car robbery. SHEMP: Yeah, I'd know him anywhere. I had a hunch it was a Lefty Loomis job. Thanks for the tip, boys. Oh, anything to accommodate the police department. Hey, Cap, don't let your coffee get cold. I'll get you a piece of pie. This is on the house. Thanks. (SPITTING) Oh, you like it, eh? That tastes like paint. Paint? What are you talkin' about? It is paint. That's the coffee. (HICCUPPING) (CHIRRUPING) This is better. Oh, boy, twelve o'clock. - See ya later, fellas. - Wait a minute. - Where do you think you're goin'? - Out to lunch. A wise guy, huh? - (HARD SLAP) - Listen, if the customers can stand to eat your cookin', so can you. - Sit down. - GLADYS: Boys? - Boys, some wonderful news. - Yeah, what is it? A letter from the lawyer who is handling my father's estate. Someone wants to buy our old homestead in the country for $1,000. Did you say $1,000? Yes. Oh, I'm so excited. Now I can pay all my bills. I'd better call Mr Scott right away. Can't be much of a joint for a thousand bucks. - Oh, it must be a rat trap. - Yeah, that's what I think. Hey, do you think maybe she's bein' gypped? Yeah. Why don't we go out there and look the joint over before we let her sell it? I think you got somethin' there. Now you're showin' intelligence. Am I? - This... - Go on! Oh, boy. Fresh clams. Boy! Clam chowder! (SLURPING) Oh, a cracker swiper, huh? - (HARD SLAP) - What's the matter with you? Knock your teeth out. You, too? - (HARD SLAP) - What's the matter with you?

Yeah, but how are we gonna find 'em? Don't expect them to walk right into our hands, do ya? MOE: Well, here we are. - SHEMP: Don't look like much. - MOE: No. - Have you got a key? - Yes, here it is. Okay. (TURNING KEY) It won't open. Must be bolted from the inside. Oh, that can't be. Well, it is. Spread out, you guys. Find somethin' to pry this door open with. It's them. Let 'em have it. I don't see nothin'. Oh, a hunk of pipe. This oughta do it. (SPITTING) Hey, Moe! Hey, Moe! What do you want? - Moe! - What is it? SHEMP: I had a piece of pipe in my hand.
