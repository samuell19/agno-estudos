MAN: The revolution in Cuba had gone on for five years. All that time, I read about it in the Miami papers. Never paid too much attention. And suddenly the whole island had exploded. The radio was filled with it. Batista and his government was on the run, and a guy named Castro who had parleyed a handful of Cuban rebels into a victorious army was a new hero. He'd won the revolution and taken Havana. As soon as the plane companies resumed their schedules to Cuba, I got a ticket in one of the first flights out of Miami. The newspaper said there was still some trouble in Havana. But I had trouble on my own and that was more important to me. And, oh, there was Havana itself and somewhere down there, my best friend, Hank Miller had disappeared. With all the shooting that had gone on during the revolution, I didn't know if Hank was alive or dead, but I had to find out. I owed it to him and I owed it to my conscience. I hadn't been in Havana in many years, but everything seemed the same. Quiet. Peaceful. The place didn't look as if something like the revolution had ever happened. You're Se?or Daggett? Yeah. How did you know my name? - [MAN SPEAKING SPANISH] - [GUNSHOT] STEVE: It looks like there was one guy who didn't believe the revolution was over. A minor incident. I must ask you to come with me to police headquarters, se?or. What for? The lieutenant will explain everything. Suppose I don't wanna? Then you will be considered an uncooperative visitor and flown right back to Miami in the next plane. Well, in that case, let's go. STEVE: Maybe it was a bad beginning in my search for Hank, but at least I was off to a fast start. A guy had been shot dead right in front of my eyes and now, I'd been grabbed by the police. You are the same Steve Daggett who made two telephone calls from Miami to the American Consul here in Havana concerning the disappearance of a Mr. Miller. Naturally, the American Consul got in touch with us here. Unfortunately, we've had little success. You've had little success. That's why I'm here. Kindly listen to me, se?or. No, you listen to me. To you boys, Hank Miller is just another name on the missing persons list. So, you play it slow and official like. Well, I want to find Hank fast. I appreciate your concern, se?or. Just a few questions, be patient. Se?or Miller's last job was as a mechanic in a small boat factory near the Waterfront. Se?or Miller had several such jobs in the city. He was fired three times. Yes. I know all about that. You own a small airfield outside of Miami. Is that correct? [SNIGGERING] You've been checking up on me, huh? And you offered Se?or Miller employment and he agreed. Well, he said he'd arrive the next morning. So, I waited all that day and I phoned him. No contact. Never heard from him again. Waited one week, two weeks... Why did your friend come to Havana in the first place? [SIGHING] Well... He had an itch that, uh, sort of kept him on the move. Was the itch alcoholic? Is that your business too? It might be. [EXHALING SHARPLY] Okay. Yeah, he had a problem. Hank had a drinking problem. And that kept him moving from job to job. I see. We understand each other, se?or. There is someone here in Havana whom I would like you to meet. Oh, who? This meeting could help find your friend. It's quite important that you come with me. Oh, then you're not asking me to meet this guy, you're telling me. Mmm-hmm? Let us say I'm inviting you, se?or, huh? Just one small phone call and we'll be on our way. [SIGHING] STEVE: For some reason, the lieutenant was clamming up about the guy we were going to see. But whoever he was, he lived well. This was no flop joint. Yes. Se?ora will see you in a moment. Gracias. Se?ora? I didn't know it was a lady. And a most interesting one. An expensive one. Hank never knew that kind. Oh? Se?orita Gray, so very kind of you. Se?or Daggett, I would like you to meet Hank Miller's wife. Well, what do you know? Hank mustn't have been as broke as he said he was. I'm very glad to know you. Any friend of Hank's is a friend of mine. Se?orita, last week, I told you that an old friend of Se?or Miller from Miami had called the consul here. Yes. With Se?or Daggett here, I thought perhaps you might recollect something you didn't remember to tell me when I first questioned you. Why should you think that? Well, since both you and Se?or Daggett were so close to Se?or Miller, it seemed natural for me to presume that you two might have met in the past. Well, you're wrong, Lieutenant. Seeing Mr. Daggett doesn't make me remember anything. GARCIA: Well, that's too bad. After all, as I told you, Lieutenant, I hadn't seen Hank for weeks and weeks before he disappeared. Therefore, I can't help you at all. Why did you come to Havana, Mr. Daggett? Oh, I have a job to do. See, Se?or Daggett is cooperating with us in trying to find Se?or Miller. And why did you come to Havana? I have a job singing at the Mirador. - [DOORBELL BUZZING] - Wow! It must pay good money. Se?or. Buenos dias! [SPEAKING SPANISH] If I had known you had visitors... Se?or Daggett, may I present one of the most eminent citizens in all of Cuba, Se?or Fernando Ricardo. Hello. Eminent before Castro or after? Se?or Ricardo does not mix in politics. He owns many plantations and he's one of the most charitable man in all of Cuba to our people. Looks like charity begins at home. Doesn't it in your country, se?or? Se?or Daggett, I think we had better go now. Yeah. Bye. Adios, se?orita, se?or. - Gracias. - [DOOR OPENING] Uh, se?orita... Please, Lieutenant, no more questions. Of course, se?or, but since Se?orita Gray apparently didn't recognize Se?or Daggett as someone she knew... Such an interesting photo of her with her missing husband and Se?or Daggett. My men found it when they went through Se?or Miller's belongings in his room. Adios. [DOOR CLOSING] Fernando. [SPEAKING SPANISH] I just didn't want to get us involved in Hank's disappearance. After all we had nothing to do with it. The police know that. [SIGHING] Well, I didn't want them to know... That you knew this man Daggett? Why? Do you think lieutenant Garcia is a fool or that I'm a fool? Steve and I were friends, yes, a long time ago. It meant nothing then and it means nothing now. Please believe me. Very well. Since it pleases me to believe you. What is done is done. You knew about Monica and me before you ever took me up there. Before that. I knew that long before her marriage to Se?or Miller, you and Se?orita Gray were very close friends. Well, if you knew that, why did you want to bring us together? To see if you were still very close friends. Oh, no. Wait a minute. You... You thought that Monica and I... That... That we had poor Hank put out of the way. It was a possibility. Well, look. If you thought I might have gotten rid of Hank wouldn't Ricardo have a better reason since Hank was married to Monica? No. Se?or Ricardo never met Hank Miller in his entire life. To tell the truth, he didn't even meet Se?orita Gray until long after she and her husband had separated. So, let us simply forget Se?or Ricardo in this case. [PHONE RINGING] [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Si, this is lieutenant Garcia. Okay. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Pardon me, se?or, but I must go now. Ah, Lieutenant, wait a minute. I'm sorry, se?or, but there are far more urgent problems than the disappearance of your friend. - Lieutenant... - Far more urgent. My poor country is still troubled by some of Batista's men who are in hiding and manage to smuggle arms into Havana. They think they might have a chance of getting Cuba back. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] STEVE: What was happening in Cuba wasn't my business, only that Hank had been here during the revolution. When I got back to my hotel, I was still burned about Garcia throwing me into Monica's lap. How did you know where to find me? The lieutenant didn't mind telling me. Oh, that's nice of him. What is he trying to do? Rub us together like a couple of sticks to see if he can start a fire? Steve, I came to explain why I acted as I did this afternoon. I know why. You didn't want Ricardo to guess you'd ever had anything to do with me. Perhaps. It's not his concern. Okay. You've explained. Get out. I'm not finished. I want to tell you about Hank and me. About Hank and you? It's simple. Hank was a pushover. He was always crazy about you. You were on your uppers and you found out Hank had a couple of bucks. Did I guess it? I never thought you'd hate me this much. Did you ever give me any reason not to? I walked out on you, Steve, because I couldn't see any future for us. I admit it. You and your little airfield, no money coming in, no chance. It wasn't much to look forward to. Does Ricardo know that if he didn't have a bank account you'd walk away? Money can make up for a lot of things, Steve. Don't knock it. Ricardo is like me. He knows what he wants and he goes after it. He's good to me. I'm happy for the first time. Don't spoil it, Steve. Congratulations. Please. Do you need money? I have money now. I can help you. - [SCOFFING] - Just leave Havana. That's really something to be bribed by you. Steve, I'm not trying to bribe you. You're forgetting a very important reason why I'm here. You've got a missing husband. What do you know about it? Nothing. I swear. We'd been separated long before Hank disappeared. I hadn't even seen him in weeks. I don't believe you. No. I think you'd get rid of a poor drunk like Hank just so you can latch on to Ricardo. That's not true. Steve, please leave Havana. You'd like that, wouldn't you? [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Yeah, this is Daggett. Who? Yeah, sure. When? A half hour? Where? The pier at the end of Avenida De Las Palmas. Bottom level. Okay. Ever heard of a man called Schluss? - Gustave Schluss? - Yeah. He's the man who owns the boat shop where Hank worked. Schluss says he knows something about Hank. I'm going to meet him. Maybe he'll tell me a few things you're trying to forget. Then you won't leave Havana? No. That's the answer. Get out and let me alone. This was the pier at the end of Avenida De Las Palmas, Pier 5. All the way over I kept wondering. How did a guy named Schluss know where to phone me, and why hadn't he told what he knew to the police? A few hours before I'd come here to get answers, instead, I found myself with more questions. What was I doing here? What could I do to find Hank that Garcia and his cops weren't doing already? Why should a poor drunken mechanic who never did anyone any harm in his life, who once upon a time had the guts to save my life in Korea... Why should he vanish in thin air? Could Monica have had anything to do with it? Maybe I should have paid more attention to that sign but my head was so filled with other things that I didn't think about the fact that Schluss had asked me to come to this deserted end of the pier instead of to his main office. It was too quiet. All I could see was a bunch of fishing boats. Something about the set up began to smell bad to me, and it wasn't the fish. Schluss? Schluss? Se?or Daggett? Oh, are you, uh, Gustave Schluss? We have a message for you, se?or. You have an hour and 15 minutes to catch the next plane to Miami. It's a funny thing about this country, everyone wants me to leave. Now get out of my... [DAGGET GASPING] You have an hour and 12 minutes left, se?or. Perhaps now you're willing to take the plane. This time I took a good look at that sign. I let it sink in. Schluss's voice had caught up with me. Now I was going to catch up with Schluss. There were two places of business in Schluss's name but so far there didn't seem to be a guy name Schluss. Schluss! What a name. Besides from the amount of dust on the hall, this boat hadn't been worked on in days. Maybe longer. Maybe even since Hank disappeared. Hank's ring. I'd seen it a lot of times. He couldn't have just lost it, because if I could find it, he could have too. Maybe he never got the chance to look. It was a long shot. But maybe that ring was telling me Hank was hidden on the other side of that trap door. Hank? Hank? Hank? You, what are you doing? Daggett. Yes, he's locked in the store room. Send me a couple of men immediately. Hurry. This was beginning to drive me nuts. Hank was gone, I was being held a prisoner. And none of it seemed to add up to anything that made sense. That frontage would give me something else to think about. It didn't look as though guys just used it to play Gin Rummy on. The map didn't seem too important to me. Just a circle somebody had put on it because they were around a lot of important buildings. I wanted out. I wanted way out. That lieutenant and I needed a heart to heart talk. Here. Come on, boys. He escaped through the air vent. [GUNSHOT] So Se?or Daggett, we meet again. [DAGGETT COUGHS] The sergeant tells me you've been sightseeing under rather trying circumstances. Yeah. I just had a 40 cent scenic tour through an air vent. I think my guide was a character named Schluss. The man who makes boats? Yeah. He phoned me not more than ten minutes ago to report that a thief had broken into his place of business. Our friend is a smart boy. He gets an alibi and the police working for him before I even have a chance to open my mouth. What would you have the police believe? I'm not sure. Please come. On the way to see Se?or Schluss you will tell me in detail exactly what happened. [MACHINES WHIRRING] STEVE: All of a sudden, the place was a beehive. And I had just told Garcia nobody had been working here for a long time. - Uh, Gentlemen? - Lieutenant Garcia, police. Of course, the man I talked to on the phone. I am Mr. Schluss. Se?or Daggett here tells me you talked to him on the phone also. Daggett? I talked to him? I know of no one with such a name, Lieutenant. Skip it. You don't expect him to tell the truth. I do not like being called a liar, Mr... Mr. Daggett. I never talked to you before. Lieutenant, the cellar is over here. Down there. Less than an hour ago, there was a map of Cuba, Havana on that wall. There was furniture. There's a table, some chairs and some crates here. All the crates were marked chocolate. Well, you certainly move fast. What happened to all the crates marked chocolate and all the other stuff that was down here? Chocolate? Me? Mr. Daggett, I'm on a very strict diet. My doctor can tell you that. Well, Se?or Daggett... Okay. So there was no chocolate. I didn't get a phone call. I wasn't locked in this cellar. And I didn't get slugged on that pier by a couple of goons. All right? Got it. We will do what we can to help find the thief who broke into... - Are you cracked? - That's enough, Se?or Daggett. [SIGHING] I insist you return to your hotel and leave further investigation to the proper authorities. Sure. Mmm-hmm. Thanks for nothing. STEVE: Now even Garcia looked suspicious to me. But maybe I couldn't blame him too much. Everything that could be done had been done to make me look like an idiot. Schluss hadn't missed the bet or was it Monica who hadn't missed the bet. I decided to find out. - Is Se?orita home? - Si, se?or, but... Good. She'll see me. Cute kid, ain't you? You'd do anything to get me out of Havana. Well, you're sorry those hoods didn't kill me? Hoods? I don't know what you're talking about. No? You're the only one who knew where I was going. You're the only one who could have set me up as a clay pigeon. Steve, I don't know anything about this. - That's the truth. - Keep lying but get one thing in your head. I ain't leaving Havana until I find out what's happened to Hank. Don't you think I want to know? I've been worried about him too. I haven't even seen Hank since we separated. Won't you believe me? No. There was a time you would have. That's the time I learned my lesson. Do you think I wanted to marry Hank? That's what throws me. What did he do? Come up with an oil well or something? I had more to offer you than Hank ever did, and that wasn't enough. I married Hank because I was sorry for him. Because I was sorry for myself. The music gets me here, but I don't like the lyrics. All right. You won't believe me. But I'll tell you once more. If there's anything I can do to help find Hank, I'll do it. - Sure. Sure. - Remember that. All right. If you won't leave Havana, what are you going to do? Maybe I'll find a way to dump those hoods right on your doorstep. STEVE: Well, this was really something. Schluss coming into the same building, the same floor. I'd taken it for granted Monica was involved in this mess and now there was the proof. I told you never to come here. I didn't want to trust the phone. For all we know the whole city is tapped. I don't like it. I'm afraid. You blundering idiot. It was your fault he got into the cellar. How could I know he would come into my shop after the beating he got? I guess those police are turning the whole city inside out. One mistake could cost us our lives. We may lose them anyhow before us succeeding getting our good friend Batista back to power. We can't afford failure, Schluss. That new shipment arrives within the hour. You take care of it. I will report what has happened. STEVE: Juan Lopez.. This was a new name to me. But that was okay. Maybe he was the fresh angle I needed to put some of these pieces together. "Chocolate shipment arrives your warehouse Tuesday night, 9:30. Stop. "Payment on receipt. Stop. "Believe quality should be satisfactory to Miller." And the Miller mentioned in this cable could be Hank. [DOORBELL BUZZING] I didn't expect you back this soon. I bet you didn't. Who is Juan Lopez? - Juan? The man who lives down the hall? - Yeah. He owns the Mirador where I work. Why? - Just that, huh? - Mmm-hmm. Nothing else? And you're the wide eyed little kid who's going to help me find Hank. - Why you... - Steve, I've had just about enough of you. Now get out. Do you know who was just in Lopez's apartment? Schluss, the guy Hank used to work for. Only Schluss is a phony and he's tied in with your pal, Lopez. I've got a cable in my pocket to prove it. And here, baby. Take a... Take a good look at that. That maybe all that's left of poor Hank. MONICA: Hank's ring. Where did you get it? In Schluss's shop, where maybe Hank got worked over worse than I did. You expect explanations from me? I don't have any. I don't know what's gotten into you, kid. In Miami, I thought you were human. Boy, the guy can be a real sucker! Come on. You're coming with me. - Where? - We're going to do a little checking. You're going to be my insurance. STEVE: If Monica and Schluss were tied up together, I stood a better chance of saving my neck if trouble came up. And Monica was with me. A cable in Lopez's place mentioned Hank and a chocolate shipment due here tonight. Maybe this time I'll get a look inside those crates and see what they really hold. Why don't you let the police do you're looking for you? That's what they're paid for. Sure. Depends on who's paying them and how much. You were different in Miami too, Steve. You used to trust people. [VEHICLE APPROACHING] Over here. Schluss. Now keep your mouth shut. STEVE: More chocolate. It began to look like Schluss was cornering a candy market. Only it wasn't chocolate at all. Those things were fuses for aerial bombs. I'd seen plenty of them in Korea. And people don't mess with bombs unless they want to drop them on somebody's head. Retreat. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Daggett. We're walking out of here, Schluss. If you try to stop us then your friend here won't like it. You're making a very big mistake, Mr. Daggett. You see, baby, he don't want you to get hurt. Out of the way, Schluss. You'll never get out of here alive. [GUNSHOT] Take them down to headquarters. And ambulance for this one. Come on. [SIGHING] Now, you know who pays the police. Sure. Thanks, Lieutenant. Schluss would have killed me for sure. Just you? The Se?orita will have to answer for herself. There are moments, se?or, like now but I'm not sure you didn't have it coming to you. You almost ruined everything. For days we've had Schluss watched. You've known about Schluss? You'll both please come with me to headquarters. Buenas noches, Se?or Ricardo. - Lieutenant. - Se?or. I came as quick as I could. Monica, what has happened? Se?or Ricardo, you're a very fortunate man. Se?orita Gray came within a few seconds of being killed tonight. The police tell me you put Ms. Gray's life in great danger. Why? Lieutenant, tell me. What is this all about? And how can it possibly involve Se?orita Gray? I am not sure that it does involve her. The man we arrested, Schluss, was one of the lower echelon of a group trying to put Batista back into power. STEVE: Batista? Well, how would Hank Miller fit into that? A very puzzling question. I would have thought he had nothing to do with it but then you found the ring and the cable. Se?orita, is there anything you can tell us? You've questioned me before. I've told you all I know. But then I thought you might remember something else like in the instance of the photograph. Lieutenant, Se?orita Gray's personal life has nothing to do with this. The donations made by Se?or Ricardo to our cause when we were fighting the revolution placed him and his friend far above reproach. Thank you. And now may we leave? Si, my apology, se?or, se?orita. Buenas noches. STEVE: Sleep tight, baby. Don't let your conscience keep you awake. You are making a very dangerous enemy, Se?or Daggett. [DOOR CLOSING] He'll have to stand in line. Send in Schluss. Again? He's a very clever and a very stubborn little man. He tells nothing. But sometimes there are ways of seeing things rather than hearing them if the conditions are right. Now, bring in Se?or Lopez. What is the meaning of this outrage? Please sit down. May I introduce Se?or Daggett, an American. I insist on knowing why I was brought here as though I am a common criminal. You are the one presuming what you are, Se?or. The police merely wish your cooperation. Have you ever seen this before? No, why should I? It is not addressed to me. It was found in your apartment by Se?or Daggett. I've never seen it before. And if this man got into my apartment, he broke the law. There are worse ways of breaking the law. This man is a dangerous supporter of Batista. What was he doing in your apartment tonight? [LAUGHING] Schluss is a dangerous man? This is not a laughing matter, se?or. Oh, I'm sorry but it seems preposterous. Oh, Lieutenant Garcia, I never thought I could get a gentleman like Se?or Lopez into such trouble. A million apologies, se?or. You mean it is true about you? Yes, se?or. They arrested me tonight. But since I visited you and Se?or Daggett saw us together... The cable about the shipment of chocolate was addressed to Schluss. Why was it found in your apartment? It must have fallen from my pocket. And then it crawled up Lopez's desk and hid under his blotter. Se?ores, Schluss built my boat. I'm a speed boat enthusiast. I race for prices and that's all I know about the whole situation. But I assure you, if I had known he was conspiring against the new government, I would have had him arrested myself. Very well, se?or. I am sorry to have inconvenienced you. You may go now. And in the future, you will please remember that I do not like having my patriotism questioned. I am in the cafe business. My interest is not in politics. And as for you, Se?or Americano, since nothing is missing from my apartment, I will not press for charges, but I would advise you to go home to your own country before you do get into trouble. Adios. - [DOOR CLOSING] - Take him back to his cell. It is amazing how many enemies you can make in one night, se?or. [DOOR CLOSING] In my job, se?or, one learns to be patient as well as vigilant. I have often found that if you give a man enough rope, he will hang himself. Lopez won't hang easy. Make sure that rope is strong. See you. Adios, se?or. STEVE: The next morning, I felt there was something wrong. Call it a hunch or premonition, anything. All I know is I had it. - Who is it? - MAN: The police, se?or. You will please come with me, se?or. Oh, something came up? Yes, sir. The lieutenant is very concerned. Se?orita Gray has been called also, se?or. Let's go. And you definitely identified these as belonging to Hank Miller? STEVE: Yeah. These things are Hank's. I was afraid something like this would happen. I tried to stop his drinking. I honestly tried, Steve. I do not think there is anything to gain by you're trying to identify the body, Se?orita Gray or you, Se?or Daggett. There is little enough for anyone to recognize. Lieutenant, how did it happen? Over exposure. He must have gotten very drunk and fallen in the rain. Where? Where was he found? In the remote area about eight miles from his home. [SIGHING] Well, I guess that washes up the matter for both of us. Thanks very much, Lieutenant. Good luck, se?or. Se?orita. I never saw Hank's place. Where did he live? A little house in the beach outside of town. I didn't know he could afford anything like that. When we were first married, I hoped Hank would change, forget his drinking. If we had a nice place to live in... I bought this little house for us. You bought it? I liked Hank. I didn't love him but I liked him. He was my friend as well as yours. I remember those days. I didn't think you did. Now, you know. STEVE: It was pretty along the beachfront. Peaceful. I could understand why Monica had thought living here might give Hank a solid reason for laying off the bottle. Too bad Hank hadn't seen it that way. Oh, this is fine. Fine. But I guess it didn't mean too much to Hank without you in it. I don't know, Steve. I'm not so sure I was good for him. I thought I'd be, maybe I was wrong. You're blaming yourself for what happened? I wish I could cry about this. Maybe I did my share when I had to leave Hank. It's hard to believe he's dead, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. He was the kind of guy that got a boot just out of breathing. Monica, I'm sorry about some of the things I said to you. I'm sorry. I guess I deserve some of them. You want to look through Hank's things? I hope there's time. So, I gather Hank was still carrying the torch for you when we were going together in Miami, hmm? But he didn't say anything about it until after you and I had broken up. No. No, he never would. After that, he begged me to marry him. At that time nothing seemed to make sense. I was still in love with you. - [SIGHING] - But I wasn't satisfied. I had to keep singing to get places. I thought if I went to Havana with Hank... You know the rest. Do I? Let's see. You married Hank, you were in love with me. And now there's Ricardo. I never stopped loving you. [EXHALING SHARPLY] Huh! It took Hank's death to make us realize. Oh, why, what a mess we made of things. Well, how do we straighten 'em out? It looks like Miami again. You bringing me coffee like nothing ever changed. It seems right this way more than all the other things that have happened. Including Ricardo? - Including Ricardo. - [CHUCKLING] - Well, he won't like it. - I know. I think we'd better be getting back. What's that? [MONICA GASPING] Hank? Hello pal. Monica! Give me a hand. STEVE: Hank was alive. His death had been strictly a plant. A phony. But who was responsible? And why had they gone to so much trouble? I got to get out of here. Lie down, Hank. You're in no condition to move around. I got to get out. They'll find me. Who? Schluss? Schluss is a flunky. It goes higher, much higher. How did you know about Schluss? Never mind, Hank. What's the deal? Why are they after you? I need to drink. Brother, do I need a drink! - Hank, it might not be a good idea. - Please. No lectures. I think there's still some rum in the kitchen. Help me up, Steve. Yeah. Easy, boy. There we go. - There we go. - [BOTTLE OPENING] What are you doing here? I came to Havana looking for you. I remember now. I had a job in Miami. Yeah. I couldn't do it, Pal. [CHUCKLING] They made me a proposition, Schluss and his men. What kind? Hank Miller, a mechanical genius, that's me. Batista's diehards have been buying up a bunch of old transport planes. I was supposed to convert them over into bombers. You let yourself be talked into something like that? Not myself. They didn't give me any choice. I told them to go take a fly and jump and they clobbered me. Give me another drink somebody. I don't feel so hot. When I woke up, I was on a tobacco plantation a hundred miles from here. Those guys will stop at nothing. Well, they got their bombers now. Well, if I didn't do what they wanted they'd have killed me. Early this morning, they got careless and I was able to swipe a Jeep. That's how I cut this. Is that Jeep around here now? No. I drove all day with them chasing after me. But finally the Jeep ran out of gas four or five miles from here. I walked the rest of the way. But when they find that Jeep... [VEHICLE STOPPING] - They're coming. - [CAR DOORS CLOSING] Hank, do these characters know you live here? No. The house is in Monica's name. - [DOOR KNOCKING] - Okay. Just sit tight. They've gone, Hank. It must be your boys, all right. - How many of them were there? - Two. Oh, there are dozens of them all around. They'll turn this whole area upside down. They can't afford to stop looking. Hank, if you did what they wanted on those planes, why should they worry about you now? I know what they're up to. At 5:00 tomorrow morning they're going to bomb Havana. [STEVE WHISTLING] Why, they're really playing it big. Besides the planes, they got hundreds of ex-army men hiding out in the hills and spies all over Havana. Garcia can warn the right people. Dead. I'm sorry, hon. I meant to pay that bill but I always seemed to get too thirsty around bill time. Steve, we've got to notify the authorities somehow. We can't let this happen. Those Batista guys will be watching the roads. Hank, you stay and rest for awhile then we'll make a run for it. Maybe we can reach town. Okay. How do you like that, the three of us back together? It's just like old times. Pablo, your bomber will lead the apex of the triangle. You will concentrate in this area. Point out your objectives. Castro's headquarters, PresidenteZone, - Administrator Justice, State Airport. - Ah! The second bomber will concentrate on Fort Gustav. And the third will finish of the job. The government buildings. - [COUNTING IN SPANISH] - [DOOR BANGING] - Captain Emilio reporting, se?or. - What is it? - [SPEAKING SPANISH] - Which one? Miller, the mechanic, he's escaped from the plantation. - [GRUNTS] - He stole a Jeep. We followed him but he got away. I think he must be wounded. We found the Jeep with blood on the seat. Find him, you fool. Radio headquarters. I want every one of our men in Havana in on this. Find him. How about it, Hank? You feel rested enough? Nothing like finding out. [EXHALING SHARPLY] No dice. We can't wait any longer. Leave me hear. I'll be okay. Do you think you can find a doctor for him, one who can be trusted? Fernando will know one. Does it have to be Fernando? He's influential, Steve. He'll know the right thing to do. Sure. He always knows the right thing to do. He got Monica, didn't he? All right. You get to Fernando. I'll try to reach Garcia. We'll drive to the edge of town and split up. Both of you know as much as I do now. If Lopez and the others find it out, your lives won't be worth a dime. We'll be careful. You just lie there, Papi. Take it easy. Sure, pal. Fernando. There will be no doctor. Fernando. You were not alone at that beach house, were you? Were you? Daggett was with you, wasn't he? Yes. Yes, he was. You love him. You're still in love with him. Fernando, you're hurting me. Answer me. All right. If that's what you want to hear. I am in love with Steve. You have made a bad choice, Monica. You have left me no reason at all to protect you. What are you talking about? Protect me from what? My plans for Cuba did not include Mr. Daggett. They no longer include you. MONICA: Your plans? [FERNANDO SPEAKING SPANISH] Get men to the Miller's beach house. Hank Miller is alive. Don't fail this time. I want him killed. [SPEAKING SPANISH] - WOMAN: Se?or? - [SPEAKING SPANISH] - You buy flowers? - No, thank you. You're selling more than flowers. I would not see Lieutenant Garcia if you want Se?orita Gray to stay alive. Don't try anything, se?or. You know I'm an old woman and I have a long time to practice with this. Come with me. Come with me. [SPEAKING SPANISH] All the orders have been given but the Major wants to know if there's anything else. No, all is set. - You can return to your post now, se?ores. - Yes, sir. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] It seems to me you had a better selection of friends before. I could buy their loyalty. Apparently I couldn't buy yours. MONICA: Steve. Ricardo. Well, what do you know. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [PHONE RINGING] Si? Lopez. Well, keep looking. Miller must be found. [KEEPING RECEIVER] I have no time for tricks. Miller is not at the beach house. Where is he? We left him there. That's the truth. You, what do you know? Well, there's a good show at the Bijou but I don't think I can make it. We are determined men, se?or. And Miller stands in our way. We must know where he is. Very well. There is a legend that Americans are less romantic than we Latins but far more sentimental. We shall see Mr. Daggett how real your love for Monica is. Look, Ricardo... You will have adequate time to change your mind. Capitan. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. Once, I would have killed any man who touched her. [MONICA YELLING] You have changed it for me, Se?or Daggett. Since she prefers you now, you will do the protecting by telling me where Miller is. He's at the beach house. MONICA: Let me go. [GRUNTING] Let me go. [SPEAKING SPANISH] He's no good to us if he can't talk. Take him in there and bring him too. One of you will tell me what I want to know before we're through. He's dead. There will be one more score to settle this, Se?or Daggett. [PHONE RINGING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Si, this is Lieutenant Garcia. Who? Who did you say this is? I'm leveling with you, Lieutenant. I'm Hank Miller. No. No. The funeral was a phony. Look, Lieutenant, I've been hurt. Will you let me do the talking before I pass out? Si, se?or. Go ahead quickly. No. Se?or Daggett never got here. They intend to bomb this morning? It is almost at now. Ricardo. Fernando Ricardo? He's got to be in on it. Monica went to his place. He's the only one that could have known to send those guys to get me at the beach house. Lieutenant, you got to send your cops to Ricardo's pronto before those... [GRUNTING] Hey, Miller. Se?or? Answer me. Se?or Miller? STEVE: I'd stalled hoping for a break. Monica was still in the other room. I know she'd be safe so long as they thought I was still unconscious. But now it was getting light. Time was running out. Soon those planes would come over. [PHONE RINGING] Si, this is Se?or Ricardo. How did they? The police are on their way now? Si.Have my yacht ready to sail immediately. Hurry. Radio all posts. The police have been alerted. Have the men go into the hills until further notice and destroy all the planes so Castro cannot get them. [DOOR CLOSING] [DOOR CLOSING] [GUNSHOT] No communications, no orders. Now, how do I get to Ricardo's boat? - The pier to Avenida San Juan. - AvenidaSan Juan. - Is your car down stairs? - Yes. Okay. When the police come, you tell them where I've gone. If our friend outside comes to, shoot him. You saved my life, baby. You better know what to do with it from here on in. [TIRES SCREECHING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Shoot. Go ahead, shoot. What are you waiting for? You're the only one who knows the names the police will want, Ricardo. No. You're not going to die this easy. [SIREN WAILING] - Steve. - It's all right, hon. There's nothing a couple of aspirin won't fix. We have a great deal to thank you for. What about Hank? Is he okay? Steve, the police got to Hank too late. I think your friend has finally found peace. Let's go home, baby.
