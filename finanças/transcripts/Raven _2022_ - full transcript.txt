[wind whistles] [surf crashes] I don't miss those condoms. I'm sure. You weren't lying to me when you said you got that vasectomy, were you? - Really? - Mm hmm. After six months, you feel the need to ask me that? It's not the only thing I wanna ask. [Man] 'Kay. Okay. What is this? It's more than just sex. - Really? - Mm hmm. [woman sighs] Sure you're okay? Yeah, yeah. If you want, I can just leave some money on the dresser and just leave. [chuckles] Well, I mean, considering this is your house, shouldn't I be the one leaving? Not if your face is the first thing I wanna see when I get back. [phone rings] Hello? Yes, it is, who is this? Yes, I am. Did something happen, is he okay? What do you mean, accident? Is he okay? Okay, I'll be there as soon as I can. What's wrong? My husband was in an accident. [somber, droning ambient music] [machinery beeps] [somber, pulsing music] [woman sniffles] [somber, pulsing music] [Man] Raven. [Raven] I'm not giving you another opportunity to put your hands on me again, Ephrem. - I deserve better. - Wait, wait, Raven, Raven. [sighs] Sit down, please, baby. Talk to me, come on, sit down. [somber, pulsing music] Don't do this, Raven. I just, you know. [Raven] Is that all you have to say? [Ephrem] No, just give me a second. [Raven] A second, is that all? Okay. It's the least I can do is give you a second to say whatever it is that you need to say to try to make up for nearly two years of physical abuse. [somber, pulsing music] [Ephrem] I just need some time. I wanna make this right for you. Listen, baby, I don't wanna lose our family, okay? I deserve that, but just let me make this right, please? [Raven] Take all the time you need to make things right. [Ephrem] Raven. Just do it for yourself, but not for us. Kenya! Let's talk about this later, don't do this. June Bug! Hey, hey, what's up, baby girl? How you doing, how you doing? Listen, it's okay, all right? I'm your father. Don't you forget that, all right? [shimmering music] Raven, slow down, just let me talk. [shimmering music] [gull cries] [Woman] So, what's been going on? [Kenya] Well, my dad got in a car accident last night. [Woman] Oh my God, what happened? He was drunk driving. Please, tell me he's okay. He's in a coma. I didn't appreciate it before. What do you mean? Well, when Mom and Dad were together, I just wish I was little again. So, what's up with Ephrem? You guys still talking? Oh my God, almost forgot to tell you. Tell me what? He's in a coma. He got into a really bad car accident last night. Apparently, he got drunk, ran right into a pole. Fortunately, no one else was involved. Sorry, God, oh my God. I went to see him last night. Figured it was the right thing to do. Yeah, I definitely wish I was 13 again. Why do you say that? Well, you know, I'm grown, I'm living on my own, you know, and I have a full-time job, which is great and all. It's just now I have a lot more responsibilities, like a car note, student loans, groceries, rent. If I didn't have a roommate, I don't know where I'd be. All I'm saying is when I was 13, I definitely didn't have to worry about any of that. How's Kenya's counseling working out? I love her. She's closer to Kenya's age. They have an amazing connection, and they have something in common. Meaning her parents were divorced? [Raven] Mm hmm. All right, okay, so how long's it been since you left Ephrem again? Oh, it's almost a year now. How is the placeholder working out? Hmm, well, the placeholder's trying to make himself a permanent fixture. Things are really heating up, huh? Yeah. What about him? The feeling's mutual. Look, it doesn't matter what's going on in your life, Kenya. There's always a different perspective you could choose to see. So, just pick the best one for you, and hold onto it. Well, what would you say the best perspective is in my case? Well, not to diminish anything you're going through, but both of your parents are still alive. They may not be together, but they're both very involved in your life. What, do you think it's too soon? Of course, I do, Rae. It's my job to think it's too soon. You're not even divorced yet. See, that's why I keep you around. You know how to keep me in check. I really like him! That's cool. Do you think my dad's gonna die? I don't have the answers to that, but you know what I'd do if I were you? [Kenya] What? I'd go talk to him. But he can't hear me. Of course he can hear you, Kenya. Can we go now? Yeah, absolutely. No. What? Sometimes it's just hard for me to wrap my mind around how much things changed for you. You guys have been such a great family. Yeah, well, you and me both. [pulsing, percussive music] ♪ Hey, yeah ♪ [pulsing, percussive music] ♪ I like where you touch me, babe ♪ ♪ You drive me crazy ♪ ♪ Sign it on the dotted line ♪ [Raven knocks] Hey, baby. Hey, Mom. How are you? I'm good. Mind if I sit down? No. So, how was your day? It was pretty good. Yeah? How was your session with Falani? - It was fun. - Really? What'd you do? She took me to visit Dad. Really? We talked. You know, that's good. I can tell that she really cares about you. No, I mean me and Dad. At least, I talked to him. [dog barks] Do you still love Dad? Of course I do. That's not what I mean. Baby, it's complicated. It's very complicated. I know about your boyfriend. Kinda figured that. [chuckles] Are you in love with him? No, no, no, it's too early. I know you still love Dad, Mom. Love just doesn't leave like that. It's just buried under all that stuff, and you gotta dig it out. Whatever you do, don't give up on Dad. Please, don't give up on him. [soft, gentle music] [fire crackles] I got you your favorite. - Thank you! - You're welcome. That's sweet. [mugs clink] [man laughs] So, how's your husband? He's the same. How's Kenya? She loves her dad. Right. Look, Quinn, I know this is not easy for you. I'm not insensitive to the way you must be feeling. Hey, look, it's okay. If the tables were turned, I'd probably be doing the same thing. I just wanna make sure you know that. Look, I gotta go, okay? I'll call you later, all right? All right. [traffic hums] [fire crackles] [soft, somber music] Is it okay for us to be here? [soft, somber music] Here, baby, have a seat. [percussive, lush music] [chuckles] Hey, Mom, you remember that time Dad came out with no clothes on? [chuckles] What, you remember that? [chuckles] Yeah, remember, he thought I thought I was in bed, sleep. But I stayed up late watching a movie. [laughs] I didn't do anything wrong. I was just watching TV. [laughs] He was just embarrassed. That was your dad. I swear, he grew up on a nudist beach somewhere in another life. Couldn't stand to wear clothes. [laughs] Couldn't? Couldn't? [somber music] You talk like he's dead. He's still here, Mom. He's right there. I know, I'm sorry. That's not what I meant. It's just- - Can you step out for a moment, Mrs. Hall? [somber, ticking music] [Raven] I'll be back. [somber, ticking music] So, how are you doing? Good. Look, Mrs. Hall, I wish I had something more concrete to tell you, but, the truth is, this could go either way. He's holding on, to what, I don't know. [somber, lush music] But I presume it's to his family. Now, I have no hard core facts for what I'm about to say to you. This is strictly my opinion, but the more love and compassion he receives from those closest to him, the better his chances are to recover. [somber, lush music] We're all flawed human beings. Flawed, but human. [somber, lush music] [Kenya pants] [somber music] So, the plot thickens. Really, do tell. I had coffee with Quinn yesterday. And? It was awkward, you know? I wanted so bad to reassure him that we'd be okay. I just couldn't. I had to feel his emotions, his thoughts, his fears, his anxiety. It's like I knew what he wanted me to say. I just couldn't say it, you know what I mean? No, not exactly. So, he just got up, kissed me, and then walked away. You didn't try to stop him? No. I wanted to. I think. You still love Ephrem. Ariana, how can I love a man that used to treat me as his punching bag? And all the bruises, black eyes. And Kenya, Kenya, she knew what was going on. She could hear the arguments. But I still lied and made up a bunch of stupid excuses for every bruise. Why'd you stay so long? That wasn't the Ephrem I fell in love with. He changed. I was hoping and praying that the old Ephrem would come back. I couldn't wait any longer. I had to leave. I didn't want Kenya to think that that was what love looked like. You know, after all of that, you know what she said to me the other day? That I should hold on. That somewhere deep inside of me, I still loved him, and that I should not give up. Amazing. Well, Rae, I just, I don't know. It's okay. Hey, Miss Ariana. Hey, Kenya. Falani's out front, Mom. Okay. Bye. Bye. I love you. [chuckles] I love you, too. [car revs] [low radio music] So, what's on your mind? How old were you when your parents got divorced? I was about 10, why? [low radio music] Do you remember how that made you feel? Most definitely. [Kenya] Please, tell me. Well, I was mostly scared. I think I knew things would be changing, I just didn't know how. I think what I feared the most is that I would miss how my dad would tuck me in at night and wake me up to breakfast every morning. I used to love that. Is he still alive? Yeah, both of my parents are, and they both remarried, and they're happy. [low radio music] How'd it make you feel when your parents remarried? Well, again, looking at it from a different perspective, I got more gifts during the holidays. [Kenya laughs] See? Why'd you ask me about the divorce? [low radio music] I think if my dad wakes back up, my mom's gonna divorce him. Don't you think you're getting a little ahead of yourself? I heard my mom talking to her friend. I don't think she loves my dad anymore. Did you hear her say that? No. Do you know that for sure? [Kenya] No. So why are you creating all these scenarios in your mind? Don't you think your plate is full enough already? Yeah, I guess. [low radio music] Well, how about this? How about we get your dad back up on his feet, first, and then we'll cross that bridge when we get there? Okay. [low radio music] [traffic hums] [phone rings] [Raven] Hello? - Mrs. Hall? - Yes, speaking. [Woman Over Phone] Can you get to the hospital right away? He's awake. Okay. I'm on my way, thank you. [car revs] [machinery beeps] You look beautiful. Thank you. Wish I could say the same about you. [Ephrem laughs] [Ephrem] [groans] I deserve that. Do you remember what happened? Yeah, every detail. So, what happened? Things got hard when you left. I tried to replace the loneliness with women, drugs, and other things. None of it could check the emptiness. [machinery beeps] So, I decided it was time to take my life. [machinery beeps] You and Kenya were the only ones I was living for, and, with you being gone, I felt as though I had no reason to live. [machinery beeps] So I got drunk and drove straight into a pole as fast as I could. [machinery beeps] So you're saying that all of this is my fault? [Ephrem] No. - Because we left. - No, not at all. I take full responsibility for my actions. [machinery beeps] Where's June Bug? She's on her way. Ariana is bringing her. [machinery beeps] She know? - Yes. - Okay. I need to gather myself. It's taken a lot for me to hold it all together, especially with you being here. - Ephrem. - Yeah? What is it? [machinery beeps] Look, I know that you started a new life. I get it. This past year has been hard on Kenya, not seeing you. She's in counseling. How's that going? Pretty good. It's a young lady from the YMCA Big Sister's program. Her name's Falani. Kenya loves her. [machinery beeps] And you? What about you, are you in counseling? Yeah, Ariana. [Ephrem chuckles] How is Ariana? Oh, you know, she loves her cocktails. [soft music] [machinery beeps] Look, I'm gonna be honest, I want my family back, and I'm willing to use every bit of strength I have left to make that happen. You really wanna talk about this right now? Kenya's gonna be walking through that door any second. Yeah. [machinery beeps] [soft music] What do you want from me, Ephrem? Just because you almost died, I'm supposed to just open my heart and let you back in just like that? No, I'm not expecting that. [Ephrem sighs] Whatever you're willing to give, I'll take it. I understand the risk of not being able to win you back, but I love you, and I'm willing to fight for us. [soft music] [machinery beeps] - Daddy! - June Bug! [soft, emotional music] [Kenya cries] Jesus Christ, Rae, talk about drama. And that's not all of it. All right, give me a second. Let me get another one. All right, hit me. Ephrem said he was gonna fight for our marriage. How you feel about that? Bittersweet. How's the BF? Bittersweet. Bittersweet, huh? Sounds like a great name for a cocktail. [laughs] Yeah. [Raven and Quinn laugh] What? [Quinn] Beautiful. Thank you. Yeah, Kenya's father woke up from his coma yesterday. Wow. That's good, that's good. It is. I'm not telling you that for the reason you might assume. - Look, Raven- - No. Let me finish. Ephrem and I were high school sweethearts, so our ties, they run deep. Outside of him, you are the only other relationship I've ever had. I need you to know that. I don't know what the future holds for us, but if we decide to move forward- - [Quinn] If we decide to move- - It's important for you to know that Ephrem will always be a part of my life, especially since we have a daughter together. Yeah. You know, not too long ago, not too long ago, we decided that this was more than just sex. Now it's it. I wish you'd stop doing that. Doing what? - You know- - Forcing my hand. Forcing your hand? Forcing your hand? I'm just stating facts. You know what I mean. [Quinn] No, I don't. - Yes, you do. - No, I don't. Yes, you do! You know, we started here, right? Now we're here. What changed? You know what changed. No, I don't. He's alive. Thank God, he's alive. I don't understand why things can't go back to the way they were. We had something, we have something. You're right. Everything you said, you're right, okay? I just need you to get out of your own head space, and step into mine, just for a second. Everything for you, everything for you is black and white. For me, there's a lot of gray, a lot of gray, and I need to try and make sense of it all. I mean, the consequences for the decisions that I have to make are far-reaching, not just for myself, but for everyone. I just need more time to figure things out. I'm sorry if you can't understand that. I'm trying. I'm trying to understand. So am I. So am I. [soft music] [Ephrem groans] [soft music] You haven't changed a thing. [soft, droning music] Really, Ephrem? [soft, droning music] Kenya, come help me clean this kitchen. [soft, droning music] [family chattering softly] [soft, droning music] Let's not even talk about UNO. I had to draw 20. [Raven] I remember that day. [soft, droning music] [Ephrem] Just like old times, huh? Yeah. [soft, shimmering music] Ephrem, what are you gonna do about your drinking? [soft, shimmering music] Since I got out of the coma, I haven't had the urge to drink. Can't explain it. What about when it comes back. If it comes back. Okay, if it comes back. I don't know, I haven't thought that far yet. I'm just happy to be alive and spend time with my family again. [Ephrem chuckles] [soft, shimmering music] What's funny? [soft, shimmering music] You remember that time when I walked into the room and I walked into the room naked while you and Kenya were watching a movie? Of course, how could I forget? You know how mad I was at her? Yeah. I was so embarrassed, I just sent her to bed. She didn't do anything wrong. I love that girl. Yeah. What made you think about that? Oh, it just popped in my head. [soft music] I'm sorry for everything I put you through, everything I put y'all through. [soft music] I better be going. I'm gonna let Kenya sleep. [soft music] Raven. Thank you. Mm hmm, good night. [door slams] [birds tweet] [traffic hums] [Raven knocks] Hi, baby. [Kenya] You just missed breakfast. Oh, really, what did I miss? [Kenya] I made turkey bacon and pancakes. Oh, how was it? It was good, it was good. Great. There's some leftovers if you want some. No, thank you, sweetheart, but I can help you clean up the kitchen. [Kenya] No, I think I got that. Okay. Can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Hey, Kenya, can you give your Dad and I a moment alone, please? What's up, Raven? Do you remember that starting a new life comment you made back at the hospital? Yeah. Oh. How long have you been seeing him? Six months. Oh. Is it serious? Yeah. How serious? Unprotected sex serious. You're kidding me, right? No. You're not gonna make this easy, are you? Apparently not. Wow, Raven. What? Don't worry, it's not like I'm gonna get pregnant or anything. We're being safe. Oh, really, that's good to know. Good to know. So, that's it, that's my new life. Well, you got a decision to make. I'll flip a coin. Heads, me, tails, your boyfriend. Whatever. [chuckles] [Ephrem sighs] You're not upset? Of course I am. What happened to you? I don't know. I guess I bumped my head. Where are you going, Mom? [Raven] I have to meet with someone. I'll be back later to pick you up. [gentle, bittersweet music] [traffic hums] [phone rings] [Kenya On Phone] Hi, Mom. Hey, I'm here. - Come outside. - Okay. Kenya, what's wrong? K-K, did something happen at your father's? No. Then what is it? You, Mom! You're the problem. Whoa, what are you talking about? You see that Dad needs you. Why would you continue dating that man? Look, you are starting to cross the line. No, Mom, you're crossing the line. We never should've left. We never should... [Raven sighs] Kenya, things happened between your father and I that I do not expect you to understand, but us leaving at that time, that was the best decision. I'm sorry I wasn't honest with you about what was going on. Your father did things to me that no one should have to go through. I know what's going on. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. I just want us to be back together so bad. Oh, Kenya. Truth is, I do still love your father. To be honest, I'm still in love with him. I'm just scared. To be honest, I'm terrified. We'll be okay. Everything will work out the way it's supposed to. [low music] I've been going through a lot lately, and I'm just... You're the only one on my side right now, other than June Bug. I just need somebody to pick me up. Jada, look, when I got out of the hospital, I came out of that coma, I was different, changed. I haven't had a drink since. Truth is, my priority right now is just getting my wife and my daughter back. I look at you, I watch you, and you're not the same Jada from 10 years ago, you know? But you just glow. You don't drink, you don't smoke. Nothing phases you. That strength, you know, you just have it all figured out. You're on top of your game. Maybe what I'm saying is I just wanna be more like my baby sis. While I might look like I have it all together, right, I appreciate that compliment, this is a practice, you know? I gotta get up every day and start over again, you know? I have my own affirmation recordings. You know, you being in that accident was a huge trigger for me. It brought back all the things that we experienced as kids, and things that I thought I had gotten rid of a long time ago. This what I want you to do. Write down everything that you don't like about yourself, everything you wanna change, and I mean everything. [Ephrem Voiceover] I believe I'm a failure. I don't feel worthy. I'm an alcoholic. I don't take full responsibility for my actions. I blame everyone for my circumstances. I resent my mother for not protecting me. I resent my father for abusing my mother. I lose focus easy. I give up easy. [melancholic music] [fire crackles] Burn the things that you don't like, right? So that the whole idea is to just get rid of the things that you don't like. [melancholic music] So after you write down all the things that you don't like about yourself. You're gonna take those things and write an affirmation for each one. So, for instance, "I'm an alcoholic." You're gonna transform that into a word or a phrase that makes you feel empowered. Most people will be tempted to say something like, "I don't drink alcohol anymore," or "I don't have the desire to." But you actually wanna write something like "I only drink things that make me feel healthy." Does that make sense? [Ephrem Voiceover] I accept people for who they are. I accept the things I cannot change. I only eat food that will nourish my body. I'm accepting of the mistakes that others have made that may have affected my life. I appreciate my family, friends, and loved ones. I'm successful in all that I do. I am a loving husband. I am a loving father. I'm focused on accomplishing my goals. [soft music] So, how you been, Rae? Maintaining. Maintaining? Well, maintaining is good. What about you? I'm good. So, any new developments? I guess you can say that. Kenya and I had a little spat. [chuckles] - Really? - Mm hmm. She really wants her dad and I to get back together. Can't say that I blame her. She's only 13, still innocent. I guess. You know, when Ephrem and I dated back in high school, those were the days of innocence. I miss those days. Still love him, don't you? Yeah. I've tried shielding Kenya from pain her whole life. You know, protect her innocence. But it's impossible. 'Cause at some point, you know, pain and innocence, they will cross paths. When they do, it just feels like, feels like you're tainted for life. Nah, you did good, Rae. Some kids get tainted way younger than 13. Hey, what happened? Good ole uncle. Everybody has one. You stayed with your husband two years too long. The minute he put his hands on you, you should've left. Don't ever regret your decision for leaving. Now, whether you should take him back. You know what I love about my relationship with Quinn? What? The innocence. [chuckles] Innocence, I don't know about that. I mean, he's never hurt me. [Ariana] Hmm. What? Just a matter of time. I mean, he's gonna hurt you, you're gonna hurt him. We're human, it's what we do. [birds tweet] So, Dad's back home. Yes, congratulations! I'm so happy to hear that. Thank you. So, how's everything been since he's been back? It's been great. I spend a lot of time with him. That's good, and your mom? Well, she comes around, but I think she's still seeing her boyfriend, though. I see, and how does this make you feel? Angry, but I understand he put her through a lot. [Falani] Right. But why can't she just forgive him? Well, how do you know she hasn't? If she would have forgave him, she would've taken him back. He's not the same, I can tell. Well, just because she's forgiven him doesn't mean she necessarily wants him back. You know, she remembers the pain he caused her, and memory can be good. It's a sign of protection. Just like, you wouldn't go put your hands on a hot stove, would you? No. And why, because you remember the first time you did that, you burnt yourself, right? Yeah, I guess. [birds tweet] So, how ya been? It's been difficult. How's your husband? [Raven] He's improving. [Quinn] That's good. Kenya's been spending a lot of time with him. How have you been? It's been difficult. I'm sure. So where do you stand, you know, regarding us? Hmm? I don't know. I'm thinking that I'm gonna spend some time to myself. - Okay, right. - And raise Kenya - as a single mother. - So you're just gonna take the easy way out? - Easy? - Yeah. - Wow. - By not making a decision. Look, you, you are something else. I need time. - I need time. - Look, Raven, - look, Raven- - You keep pressing - me for answers. - Raven. - I need time. - Raven. What? I have a new opportunity. My company's expanding. We're opening a new office in Florida, which I'm gonna have to go and oversee, all right? I'm hoping that you, Kenya, will come with me. We can start a new family, all right? We can get married. I love you. I love you. I couldn't take Kenya away from her father. I was afraid you'd say that. I guess I just made your decision much easier, huh? Why are you doing this? Don't look at me like that. [Raven sighs] Just... God. I never thought that. What'd you think was happening, huh? It's like you told me, life's difficult. It's not just black and white. There's a lot of gray areas, all right? Divorces, car accidents. You know, that's life. You just gotta deal with it. I'm sorry. Where you going? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right, go back to your abusive husband. [Raven] Ephrem, I'm afraid of you. I know. I still love you. Yeah? I just don't know what to do. Who says we have to make a decision right now? There's time. We have a beautiful daughter that loves us. Let's just focus on her and let the rest work itself out. Quinn's moving. His company is opening a new office in Florida. He wants me and Kenya to go with him. And? I think you know the answer to that. [low ambient music] [Ephrem Voiceover] I only eat food that will nourish my body. I appreciate my family, friends, and loved ones. I accept people for who they are. I accept the things I cannot change. I'm successful in all that I do. I'm accepting of mistakes others have made that may have affected my life. ♪ Open your eyes ♪ I'm focused on accomplishing my goals.

Did you get a test yet? Yes! And? I'm pregnant. What? I thought you said he had a vasectomy? He did! I mean, at least, almost five months into our relationship. And did he ever get a final sperm count test? What, what is that? I don't know, he never mentioned anything about that. Well, that explains it. He was supposed to go back to the surgeon and make sure the sperm count was zero before having unprotected sex again. Wow. Wow is right. [Quinn On Phone] Hello? [Raven] Hey, are you busy? [Quinn On Phone] No, what's up? [Raven] Can you meet me at our spot? [Quinn] Okay, sure, what time? [Raven] In about an hour. Okay, see you soon. What's wrong? I'm pregnant. What? How, how? How's this happening? I had the vasectomy. Did you get the final sperm count report? The doctor said I should be clear in 30 days. Yeah, but did he tell you to come back and get the final sperm count report before having unprotected sex? Yes. What, you don't believe me? So what do you wanna do? What do I wanna do? What do you want me to do? It's not like I'm gonna be around to help you with it. - What? - I can't do this right now. So you're just gonna leave, huh, just gonna leave? You walk back into my life, you tell me you're pregnant, and then you leave without a plan? Do you even care what I'm going through right now? Of course I care! I wouldn't have come back to tell you that I was pregnant if I didn't care. It's not like I planned any of this to happen. I'm not a psychic, I didn't know that any of this was going to happen. I have a daughter. I have a daughter that adores her father. Why she adores him, I will never understand, after everything that he has done to me. But if I turn my back on him right now, she'll never forgive me. Do you understand that? She will never forgive me! As for this baby. [laughs ruefully] As for this baby, it took you, what, a matter of seconds to decide what should be done, so, as far as I'm concerned, I am on my own. I'm sorry, Raven. I'm sorry. Yeah, so am I! [car revs] Ephrem, I've figured out what I'm going to do. [Ephrem] Okay. I'm going to raise my kids as a single parent. Kids? I'm pregnant. What? I just found out. Wow. Oh, Quinn, he had a vasectomy, and we didn't wait for the final sperm count report before having sex. Raven, you're smarter than that. I thought so, too. What does he have to say about this? He doesn't want me to have it. Look, Ephrem, I'm going to have this baby. I've already been raising Kenya on my own this past year, anyway, so, that's what I'm going to do. I'm not looking for your opinion, not your help, not even your sympathy. It's my decision. I will figure this out. I'll figure it out. Raven. Sit down, please. [soft, gentle music] I don't want you to keep walking out on me. This is all my fault. You were my family, and I pushed you away, pushed you into the arms of another man, and that would have never happened if I loved you the way you deserve to be loved. [soft, gentle music] You're a phenomenal, phenomenal woman, with a lot of love to give her man, and if the price for my sins is to raise another man's child, with my wife, then so be it. You're worth it. And I love you. I love you. [soft, gentle music] [dramatic, shimmering music]
