Nice! What a smooth landing. All right, sorry, Brett. Look at the camera? Just look at me, if you can see me. -Yeah, yeah, I can see you... -Uh, Sorry. So, um, what's going on right now, Brett? What an amazing privilege to be here. What day is this of her pregnancy? This would be 652 today. Hopefully it's tonight. Get it over with. It will come when it comes. It's soon, though. Maybe tonight. C'mon, c'mon. Contractions have finally started. So yeah, hopefully it's the last day. It's enough now, we need a baby. We keep on waiting. We wish the baby could just come. What we have here on the board are the suggested names for Kiti's baby. I think the most pertinent one is Lobaka, "a long time," because we've been hanging out here waiting for her to give birth for nearly two weeks. Because Mr. Brett Mitchell here got the dates wrong! Uh-uh, uh-uh... I did not get the dates wrong! Those are beautiful names with beautiful meanings. I'll go for Naledi! A star! 13 days in, I think we have enough footage of a calf not being born. Pregnant elephant not giving birth is covered! Day number 661. About to have a baby. It's been a long wait, so... We're about to have a baby, so looking forward to it. Come on, come on. Here we go. Here we go, here we go. Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet. Quiet. Oh, my god, it's trying to stand. Did you see the baby? Baby was waiting for Liz and AK to come. -Very excited. -Very happy. I've been working with elephants for almost 20 years. When I see Naledi, it's like seeing a new member of the family. She's like the same as my daughter. So I'm very proud of her. I love to see our elephant family growing up. So we have achieved what we've been long waiting for. Ha, beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Abu Camp is now a halfway house, I suppose. Taking on elephants that have had a bad background. Some of these elephants we've got here, they are orphans. The other ones, they are from the zoo or circus environment. The rest, they were born in captivity. Abu Camp is a safari camp. The guests, they come here, they get a chance to walk with the elephants. We take them out to a different location each and every day and then give them a chance to be as natural as possible. You know, it's part of being an elephant. I'm an African, born and raised here in Botswana, and the bush is just a part of me, it's in my blood. I've been part of this herd for the last four years. I've been tasked with looking after them. I mean, it's a remarkable privilege and one that has taught me so much that being an elephant biologist out in the field I could never have learnt. There is just no other program like it anywhere in the world. And our philosophy at Abu is to eventually reintroduce these amazing animals back into the wild. They're free-ranging during the day, feeding, drinking, mud-wallowing... being wild elephants. I'm very happy, to be honest with you, with what is happening with Naledi, the way she is being accepted by the herd. Everything seems to be working well. Kiti was an orphan. She was separated from her herd and now she's been here ever since. She's a great mum. Good girl. She's got a little calf, Lorato, who is now 5. And then Paseka came in as a little orphan and they accepted her in beautifully. I don't think she's got a bad bone in her body. She's one of the sweetest elephants I've ever met. All right, Kiti, hey. I just look at her and she's just perfect. I would like to see Naledi live out a natural life as wild as possible, and that's the decision that she will ultimately have to make. But having said that, the challenges that elephants face across Africa are so complex. Loss of habitat. There's increasing human-elephant conflict, retaliatory killings, exacerbated by the demand for ivory. We are losing elephants every 15 minutes, 96 elephants a day. And a year, it's estimated that we may be losing between 25,000 and 30,000 elephants. We know how fast we're losing elephants, but how many elephants currently exist on the African continent is guesswork. How can you conserve something which you don't know anything about? So our mission over the next year, put in a nutshell, is essentially to count Africa's elephants. Up, up and away. We'll take to the skies. We'll be starting here in Botswana, and then we'll extend to include Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa. Oh, he's beautiful. One bull shaking his head at us big-time. Then on to Tanzania, Kenya, South Sudan through to Chad. Oh, my goodness, look at all these elephants coming up. This is a daunting project of massive proportions, which has never been attempted. One bull, big one, beautiful. But, besides the challenges, I'm hopeful. How many elephants have survived the onslaught of poaching? Are there isolated pockets of elephants that are thriving? God, look at these bulls, Mike. -Nice! Beautiful tuskers. There's so many unknowns, and this survey will provide us with some of the most important information ever to ensuring the long term survival of elephants. And I've devoted my life to conserving these majestic creatures. Got the phone call on Sunday, and immediately I phoned our veterinarian. By the time the vet arrived here, her main intestine came out. I consulted with as many people as I possibly could, and that's when I learnt that there was very little chance of hope. Then, she lied down because she was in big stress, and also in very heavy pain. I didn't go there when the vet was putting her down. He had to inject her to put her to rest, and that was the end of Kiti. She died from a prolapse of the large intestine. We did what we felt was right, and that was to bury her. You know, Kiti wasn't just any elephant. You know, it caught us, all of us, by surprise, and we still not believe that Kiti is gone. We think maybe she's gone for a, you know, she went out for a journey for a visit somewhere, maybe one day she will come back. I think that's enough. You know, this little girl has been through such a tragic experience, and I'm confident that she will... she'll pull through this difficult time. It seems like she's going over it. I have the feeling that she is going through hard times, and it will stay within her mind for the rest of her life. Good girl, Cathy. Good girl, OK. In the Abu herd, we've got Cathy. And all the babies, they treat her as the grandmother. Cathy has never had her own baby in her lifetime. Cathy, wait. She was taken as a baby at the age of one, and she has been in zoos and circuses for more than 20 years. Cathy, let's go! Naledi went to Cathy. Although she's the oldest, she can be sometimes unpredictable. But she let Naledi to suckle from her. She managed to get a little bit of milk then. What's really incredible is how Cathy has been able to produce milk when she's never had a calf of her own, that's just phenomenal. Now, is Cathy producing enough milk? Is there enough nutrition in it? We just take each day as it comes. She's thin. It's amazing how much weight she's lost. Do you think she got enough milk today? No, she's not getting enough. So what can we do to make sure that we give her more chances? After Kiti's death, the biggest challenge is to feed Naledi. I'm gonna try and put artificial milk next to Cathy's nipple. Then she might take it. I'll keep on trying. Each and every day... Naledi is losing weight and she's becoming skinny and weak. You could see that the jaws were sticking out. Showing that she wasn't getting enough food. Cathy actually doesn't know how to take care of the baby... and doesn't have enough milk. She's living off body fats, essentially, that's what's keeping her going, and when those reserves have run out, it's a very quick deterioration. Come on. I tried to rub it around her lower lips. I've tried to rub the milk formula around Cathy's breasts. You know, we're all feeling helpless. The solution to saving her life is for her to take the milk formula. She's reached such a low ebb now. This is the weakest we have seen her. She looks drained, she's lethargic. Her little eyes are weeping, she holds her head low. Signs that I've seen out in the wild of young calves that have been abandoned and are on their way out. At the rate she's going, Wellie... we will lose her. OK? In this situation. All we're doing is buying her more time. But the rate we're going now... you know, I don't give her more than two, three days. We have to try and do something. The best way is to separate her from all the rest of the herd. The two sisters will be stressed, but it won't help at all if we try and keep them together. This is the last option now. -OK, take Cathy. We need to open. Open, open. Open the side. Open. Easy, Naledi. Mike, get inside. It's our last... ...option to make sure she pulls through this. You know, we were watching her die and this is the only chance that we have of saving her. We're asking ourselves, you know, did we do the right thing? Easy, easy, easy. You know, there is no manual for this work. It's unpredictable. And it's very conflicting for all of us because we are really trying to do the best we can to save Naledi's life. Here you go, Wellie. Just feed it to her. -Right temperature? -Much better, thank you. Hi girl, hi! -Hi! -Take this bottle. Please don't let me down! We have to be like their mothers. We have to be with her 24/7. That's how she'll end up accepting you as her mother. 'Cause she knows that you are the provider. That's a good girl. You know, she's still clearly a little nervous. Come on, girl. We're offering her powdered milk. You know, we've just got to take it one step at a time. She wants it all! That gets her trunk up. Come here. OK, all right. All right, shh, shh. Come. Come, Naledi. Tell me, what's wrong with you? You want to suck my finger? Oh, no, my ear. I can't get inside her heart or inside her mind and tell exactly what she's going through. What they need is love. Feel good? This is her first night away from the rest of the herd. She's had a very stressful day and she's just drained. She just needs a good night's sleep as close to Wellington as possible. Come, let's sleep. Come on. Sleep with Wellie. There you go. We mustn't leave her by herself. The minute you leave her by herself and she can be stressed from that and then she can die from that stress. So we have to make sure that she has got someone 24/7. I guess it's been nearly eight hours and she hasn't suckled from the bottle. If she, if she gives up fighting... we'll lose her. It's amazing how these animals quickly adapt. -I think she's got used to us. -Yes. Come, let's go for a walk. Come on. Good Mikey. Cup of coffee. It's the most important day in Naledi's life. If she doesn't build a relationship and a bond with us, then we're faced with some pretty bleak situation. Steady. Steady. Stay. Good girl. Good girl, Naledi. You have to be very close to her trunk and she has to feel your face, your nose. That's how you build your bond with her. Mix the powder to a nice consistency. Come on, girl, hey. Hey, girl. Come on. I was worried about Naledi, that she wasn't going to make it... but now she has got us. We are there to look after her, to protect her. Come on. Let's go say hello to everybody. Here's dad! Had us worried all day! -What have you done? -Baby. We thought that she wasn't going to survive. Six veterinarians told me she wasn't going to make it, but she's well on the road to recovery. They will keep a watchful eye on her. She's still too small. And Naledi's situation reminds me of how many other orphaned calves are possibly roaming the continent now, when there could be hundreds, thousands who have lost their mothers to poaching and are looking for help. I've got to return to the task at hand. -Ready. -Ready. Right. I love it, it's started! -All right. Well done! I like this, I like this. We are flying to the famous Babile Elephant Sanctuary. It's known to have the largest elephant population in the country. Oh, it's a beautiful river, wow. The scenery is lush and green. I'm astounded by the beauty of it. Beautiful day for this. Yeah, it's beautiful. Are we in the national park now? Just about. I think the boundary's here. It's an epic landscape, but I look forward to seeing the elephants. I don't know what those buildings are. Are we in Babile National Park? - Yeah. - This is the place? No. I mean, this is a massive town. There are just people everywhere. I told the pilot, "You've got the wrong coordinates. This can't be the elephant sanctuary." I'm expecting a wild, pristine habitat where you would expect to see elephants. You don't expect to see people in national parks. Ethiopia is home to 93 million people, who need to rely on our natural environment to survive, and I empathize. But I don't know if policy makers and decision makers are really aware what's at stake. Where are most of the elephants seen? Usually they are using this valley. -It's worth going to have a look, yeah? -Do they know where it is? 50 cattle. Big village. Surrounding farms. -Where are the elephants, guys? -I don't know. Over the last three days, we've spent 20 hours flying in a fixed wing. 60 cattle. We've spent nearly 15 hours in a helicopter. Unfortunately, we didn't see any elephants. Land that used to belong to the elephants has been eroded away and settled by people. So I don't hold out much hope for the rest of the elephant range or national parks in Ethiopia. But we can't give up. Elephants! There they are! -Where, where? -Three o'clock. Wow! Wow. -Wow! -Bloody hell! Whoo! Wow! -You see them? -Yeah, I see them. When I first saw them, my initial reaction was one of just great surprise and shock that indeed there are elephants left. What luck, eh? -Oh, yeah. -Pure luck. But there was only one bull. Forty elephant cows and one bull. He's the only sexually mature bull left in that herd to cover those cows. He's a target for poachers. That whole herd is... ...teetering on the brink of local extinction. If he gets shot... ...that's the end of it. It takes quite a lot of work to look after a baby elephant. We got all the handlers to rotate on the Naledi shift. Not even a minute had passed without being with Naledi. Naledi, come, come on, girl. Hello, my girl. As you can see, she's very strong and healthy. Before, you could see her jaws sticking out... but now she's doing great. Kenya has always been at the top of our list for the pan-Africa aerial survey. The country has always been at the helm of elephant conservation. This is one of the last strongholds for African elephants. I hope you're finding some elephants now, I hope. Nice numbers. Along a dry riverbed. -How are you doing, mate? -Are you well, mate? -Very good. -Good. Well, we've found a pretty special one just up the road here, so you might just see your big elephant. Wonderful, look forward to that. We saw some beautiful tuskers today, actually. Beautiful. They were thick in there. Nice numbers. Do you find that poachers are specifically targeting bigger tusked animals or anything? Anything. One thing is for sure: if they're not looked after, they ain't gonna be here for tomorrow, as plain and simple as that. He's a really special guy. He's called Satao. His tusks are touching the ground! It's certainly the biggest boy I've seen. It is one of those things that you think are a forgotten thing of the past, but, in fact, he's right there. I'm just wondering why he would be a little skittish and shy. We noticed two horrible wounds on his left side. One was oozing pus and the other dripping blood. He's clearly been targeted. A rare treasure, eh? Imagine what he could be just to be given another five years. Last time I was at Abu was four and a half months ago. The last I heard was that Naledi was doing exceptionally well. She's gained weight, she's very playful. She puts a smile on my face, so that's enough for now. There's an element of great excitement to see Naledi. I doubt whether she'll remember me, but... just seeing her is going to be thrilling. Hello, my girl. Naledi, hi. Hello, my girl. Hello. -Hey, hello! I missed you, man, hey? Hello. Yes. I missed you too, hey? Hey, my girl, yes, I missed you too, eh? The guys have taken such good care of her while I've been flying the aerial survey. She doesn't have that sunken look and that glazed look over the eyes. You can see she's strong. She's certainly healthy. She's chubby and strong and there's a sparkle in her eye, which is really encouraging. Well done, Onx. I'm very proud of you guys. You've done well. Do you think she's ready to go back, Onx? I think we always spoke about Naledi's reintroduction. Do we think that perhaps now is the time for her to go back and join the rest of the family and her sisters? I think this is the time, Mike. You know, she needs to start learning from the herd. So what's the plan, then? Naledi's ready, and the rest of the herd, especially Lorato, are looking forward to meet her sister again, already. She's been away from the herd for four months, so I think it's the time for her to come and join up with the herd. It's not as simple as opening the door and saying, "Naledi, here's Lorato." We don't want the moment to be marred by a bad response by the rest of the herd. Brett, Brett, Brett, do you copy? Lorato and them are going to come from the other side now. It needs to be a gradual reintroduction. A little bit closer. It's about equal distance where Mike and Naledi are. So they can start walking in together, it's fine. Hey, Mike. Is Lorato coming over first? Yeah, Lorato's in front here. She'll pick up her scent just now, I'm sure. -Yeah, her trunk's already up. -Yeah. Lorato is Naledi's big sister. So hopefully she is accepted within the herd. They can walk her. -Let it happen. OK. Easy, easy. -Good girl. -Lorato, easy, girl. All right, Lorato. Come, girl. Come, Lorato. Come, Lorato, yeah, good girl. It's your sister, Lorato. Good girl. Lorato, easy, girl. All right, Lorato. Come, Lorato, it's your little sister. Lorato, come. Come, Lorato. Lorato's very confused at the moment. What's going through her head is, "This is not right." Potentially saying, "Hang on, this is not right. I know this smell, but she's been gone. Where's she been gone?" She hasn't seen her for 4 1/2 months. Can you come with Sherini and Warona? Just ask Chris to hang back there. Just give them a bit of space because none of us want to get knocked over. Come, Paseka! Come, Paseka, good girl. Paseka is the adopted sister of Naledi. All right. Easy, easy. She's always been there for Naledi. Good girl. Come, Paseka, come, Paseka. Easy, easy. Come, Paseka. Come see here. Come, Paseka. Just let it happen. Let it happen, let it happen, let it happen. Let it happen. -Come, Lorato. Come, Lorato. -Let it happen. Just a nice big circle. Just keep circling her, Sonny. Come this way. -All right. Easy girl, all right, all right. It's your sister. Good girl. That's your sister. Yes. These animals have incredible bonds. Clearly Naledi remembered Paseka and Lorato, and they just picked up where they left off. We all thought she was going to come directly to us, but look at her. She's quite comfortable with her two sisters. Where she belongs, eh? In and amongst those legs. See the ears? The whole family is celebrating, and I think that's exactly what is happening here, you know. You can't take away that bond. You're not going to take that away. She'll come back. She wants...she will have it. She'll come back to the milk. You must remember when you have your own baby, you mustn't mix a 2-liter coke bottle, eh? Naledi, now she's becoming an elephant. She's eating a lot of grass and leaves. She's growing each and every day. Her two sisters, they've got a very big role to play. They're going to teach her which grass to pick or which plant to eat and make sure that she doesn't roam far away from the herd. She has to know who to be scared of, who to be comfortable around with. There's just a lot that she has to learn. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪♪ It makes me very happy now she's grown, and we are very good mothers. Not fathers, no, but mothers. Come and eat your cake. It shows that we've made it. ♪ Naledi, Naledi... ♪ Naledi has not been well. She's always energetic and playing around, running, picking grass, leaves... but she didn't want to eat, she didn't want to drink. She's definitely weak. She's clearly not feeling well. We don't know what it is, but she's just not full of energy. I'd rather just be on the safe side and have Rob come and look at her. She's dribbling. I'm just scared she's eaten something stupid. I would like to maybe give her something to make her feel a bit more comfortable. OK, you guys good? We are good. Very good. Well done, OK. OK. Well done. She's suffering from severe constipation. But unfortunately, it just got worse and worse. She had been poked and prodded and given enemas and tubing via her mouth in hope that she was going to be able to pass this blockage, but it just got worse. I didn't know how long she could sustain this for. I asked the vet what her chances of survival were, he said 30%. Swabs before we do anything. Surgery was the only alternative to try and remove this blockage. We want a vein. It was like watching your child being operated. You could see most of us were worried about, is she going to make it? Maybe this is the end of it. We gave her general anaesthetic, which is quite dangerous. It's always a risk putting any animal or human being under anaesthetic, always. She's not breathing. Down on the table right here. We can wash with... -Rob, she's not breathing! -OK. -Got my hand in here. -Check the breathing and the pulse. Where's the heartbeat? There's some adrenaline on the left-hand side. Let's get the oxygen onto her. -Is she going? -No, nope. Give her that. Shall I give her some Antisedan? Dopamine and Antisedan. Luck. That's the polite version. You can give her... Let's see if she does it again. -That's the heartbeat. -Yeah. -You need to be not touching her. They started opening her up... and all of a sudden... for sure we saw the problem. Then he opened a small space. Then he started pulling all the palm leaves out. How's Naledi? She's doing better, thank you. She's still clearly in a lot of pain, and she's not drinking as much milk as I would like her to be. How much did she have today? Well, from 6:00 this morning up to now, she's only had five litres, which is -- That's bad. Yeah. Compared to 60 litres a day, yeah, it's worrying. She needs that milk, obviously, to build up her strength. OK, then, I'll talk to you in the morning again, eh? Yes, I'll let you know when I get in, Dad, thanks. OK, bye. All right, check you later, bye. Here in the delta, a lot of elephants, they eat palm leaves. A baby elephant eats too many, or too much of it, it will cause problems. We have to keep her away from the palm leaves until she's three to four years... which means she will have to stay within this enclosure all day long, while her family, they are out in the bush feeding. It's very difficult for her. She is still a baby, you know? She is missing her two sisters. Elephant bones. Between three and four, Mike. They're scattered, but you can really see an elephant. Elephant bones, Mike. Uh... Got, I would say, four, and three giraffes. I've seen a lot of elephant carcasses that have been poached and had their faces hacked off and their ivory pulled out. Elephant carcass. Doesn't look good, eh? 2012 was the worst year for us. 2012 we lost a lot of elephants. This elephant was shot on Tuesday. That's a bullet wound. It's a female, that's a female. Can you believe it that people are killing these animals, chop out the tusks so people can adorn their houses as a status symbol and decorate their homes, leaving us in Africa with a landscape strewn with rotting carcasses? How can you possibly display ivory in your house and be proud of this? I can't tell you. It's just too sad. Twelve elephants have been slaughtered in the single worst recorded ivory poaching in Kenya. It's happening on our watch. The rate of killing is unsustainable. Ivory poachers killed more than 80 elephants in Zimbabwe. More than 20,000 African elephants were killed. The State Department called on world leaders to stop the epic slaughter of African elephants. If we cannot save the world's largest land mammal, the African elephant... you know, then the prognosis for wildlife conservation in Africa is bleak. Poachers have killed one of Kenya's most famous elephants. Tsavo Trust confirmed that Satao was shot dead by poisoned arrows... The giant elephant had tusks that nearly reached the ground and is believed to have been one of the world's largest living elephants. Satao was killed by an ivory poacher's poisoned arrow to feed a seemingly insatiable demand for ivory in far-off countries. Naledi's struggle is really emblematic of the crisis that we find ourselves in. Her story has been told. There are many anonymous elephants that are orphaned by poaching and this insatiable demand for ivory. The death of one is a tragedy. The death of tens of thousands becomes a statistic. Her journey is really emblematic of the journey we are embarking to save her wild cousins... ...if we are able to act now... because we don't have a lot of time. So I'm extremely pleased to bring our next presenter on, Dr Mike Chase from Elephants Without Borders. Conservationist George Schaller once said, "We have a moral responsibility to help protect the species we study." -Look at these bulls, Mike! -Nice! I've had the privilege to study one of the most remarkable creatures on our planet... Beautiful tuskers! ..,the African elephant. Imagine what he could be just to be given another five years. I wish I could tell you here today that our elephants are still thriving. The family of elephants was shot multiple times. But they are not. Satao was shot dead. We need the government to do something. I've documented with regret the retreat of elephants from habitats that were rapidly recolonizing. It's almost impossible. It's just wall to wall people. I don't think I brought enough data sheets to record all the human settlement. The present ivory war has hampered growth in elephant numbers that took place between 1990 and 2010. They died after water holes were poisoned with cyanide at... Last month, our team flew an aerial survey in one of the parks, which, in 2003, had 2,000 elephants. There's an elephant carcass. That's a carcass? We counted just 33 elephants and 55 elephant carcasses. Every year, 25,000 elephants are being killed by poachers. Guns are sold in streets, like vegetables. We are determined to count each savannah elephant on the continent... OK, one more. ...the live ones that offer us hope... Wow! Do you see them? ...and the dead ones that remind us of the fate of these animals if we don't stop these unsustainable rates of killing. If I constantly think about it, I wouldn't be able to do this work. Eventually, we'll win this war. We'll need a bit of help, yes, but we will win this war. A strong momentum from all over the world... ...is developing to turn this tide. We have to act rather than talking. The United States and China have made a commitment to stop ivory trade. When they buy ivory, there's a gun shot happening in Africa. No tradition or fashion is worth the extinction of an entire species. That we're not only crushing ivory, we're crushing the bloody ivory market. I humbly request your support in our quest to save the African elephant. Thank you. I hope that the future of the rest of Africa's elephants are as bright as I think Naledi's will be. Hello, Baba, how are you? -Are you well? -Yeah, just an update regarding Naledi. How is she doing? Yeah, she's better. And yesterday she had 26 litres of milk. Yeah, sure. Yeah, so sometimes it's only good news, not bad news all the time, man. C'mon. Come on. Are you teaching me how to swim, Naledi? She is getting better each and every day. She seems to be strong enough to go out to join the herd for a few hours. Where are you going? She's a free Mandela. Naledi. They are here. All the ladies are here. Come, come here. Come. I don't know what is going to happen. If she should like to live with us for the rest of her life, that would be all right. And if she's happy to go and live in the wild, it's also OK. You cannot tame a wild animal. So if it is happy to be with you, so be it. If it is not happy to be with you, let it be wild. And rolling. You've got no control of that trunk, my dear. You've got no control over that trunk. Naledi! What do you want? Have you got an itchy nose? ♪ Naledi, Naledi... ♪ Naledi! Maybe she can play the guitar.
