(TRIBAL DRUMS PLAYING) Subtitles by Arjun Karikotil (PANTING) (SPEAKING MOHICAN) (CHlNGACHGOOK: Hello! John Cameron ! (DOG BARKlNG) Chingachgook! How are you? The Master of Life is good, John. Another year passed. How is it with you? Getting along. Yes, l am. JOHN: Nathaniel. Hello, John. Cleared another quarter, l see. Yes, l did. Alexandra. Welcome. Jack, how are you? Hello, Nathaniel. How've you been? Good. Thank you. Where you boys been trapping? West of the Cuyahoga. Why is Uncas with you? He should have settled with a woman, started a family by now. LlTTLE GlRL: Hey! Hey! Hey, Uncas, look! Mohawk field we saw was five mile long on the river. Chief Joseph Brandt's field. You take much fur? That we did. Lots. The Horicon's near trapped-out now. Where are you trading your skins? Castleton? No. Schuylerville. Schuylerville, with the Dutch, for silver. French and English want to pay with wampum and brandy. So what is it, Jack? What brings you here? French and lndian army are heading south out of Fort Carillon to war against the British. l'm helping to raise New York's militia to fill the Crown's levy. And the people here are gonna join in that fight? We'll see in the morning. Where're you boys heading? We'll trap over the fall. Winter in Can-tuck-ee. Find a Delaware-speaking woman for Uncas. She will say, "You are the one!" Bear him many children. BOY: Then you can have a boy like me. Never. You're too strong. Turn me old too fast. That's what he's doing to his mama. MAN: John Cameron, thank you for your hospitality. Mohawk traded furs with les francais. We got no quarrel with les francais. Now les francais bring Huron, Ottawa, Abenaki onto Mohawk land. Now Mohawk will fight les francais and Huron. l speak for the Twin Rivers Mohawk of the Six Nations. His Majesty, King George ll, is very grateful for your support. How far up the valley? Up to Fort William Henry. That's two nights and a bit from here. Should be enough to remind you all that France is our enemy. MAN: France is your enemy. What did you say? While we're at your fort, what if the French attack our homes? What then, Lieutenant? For your homes, for King, for country! That's why you men ought to join this fight! You do what you want with your own scalp. Do not be telling us what we ought to do with ours. You call yourself a patriot? A loyal subject to the Crown? l do not call myself subject to much at all. (PEOPLE CHUCKLlNG) l agree with some of what Nathaniel and John say, but l believe England's still our sovereign. MAN 1 : l'll go. MAN 2: We will go to fight the French. MAN 3: My brother and l will volunteer up. MAN 4: l'll fight with you, Jack. JOHN: l'm staying on my farm. Any man who goes, his family's welcome to fort up with us till he comes back. Boys, my sense of it is we have enough here to fill the county levy, and it's a fight we ought to make. But first we got to get terms from General Webb. Where are you meeting him? We'll go to Albany. (SHOUTlNG PLAYFULLY) Attention ! We speak for the men, not command them. lf they're not allowed leave to defend their farms and families if the French attack the settlements, then no colonial militia is going to Fort William Henry. They will report or be pressed into service. Any of the boys worth having can disappear into the forest. They will be found. And where does that leave you then? Those men will be found, arrested. . . l cannot imagine His Majesty, in his benevolence, would ever object to his loyal American subjects defending their hearth and home, their women and children. Does that mean they will be granted leave to defend their homes if the settlements are attacked? Of course. You got yourself a colonial militia, General. lt is what we wanted. Major Duncan Heyward reporting, sir, en route to Fort William Henry and bearing dispatches. Safe journey, l trust? Yes, and l didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as that that l witnessed here today. And what was that? The Crown negotiating the terms of service. l know. One has to reason with these colonials to get them to do anything. Tiring, isn't it? But that's the lay of the land. l thought British policy is "Make the world England," sir. l see you're to serve with the 35th Regiment of Foot at Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. l'll be marching the 60th to Fort Edward. Explain to the Major, he has little to fear from this General Marquis de Montcalm in the first place, and therefore scant need of a colonial militia in the second, because the French haven't the nature for war. Their Latinate voluptuousness combines with their Gallic laziness. And the result is, they'd rather eat and make love with their faces than fight. (MEN LAUGHlNG) Might l inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? l was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort, sir. You there, what does Munro call you? The Scotsman has sent you one of his Mohawk allies to guide you. Magua. The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 60th will accompany you, and Magua will show you the way. Dawn. At the encampment, 6:00 a.m. sharp. See to it you're there. l'll take him for you, sir. Cora. Duncan ! How long have you been in Albany? For days and days. And yourself? Just arrived. By God, it's good to see you. l don't know what to say, Duncan. l truly wish they did, but my feelings don't. . . Don't go beyond friendship. Don't you see? Respect and friendship. lsn't that a reasonable basis for a man and a woman to be married? And all else may grow in time? Some say that's the way of it. Some? Cousin Eugenie, my father. . . Well, then, Cora. ln my heart l know, once we're joined, we'll be the most marvelous couple in London. l'm certain of that. So why not let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you? ln view of your indecision, you should rely on their judgment. And mine. Will you consider that? Please consider that. Yes. Yes, l will. ALlCE: Duncan ! By God, you've grown up. We leave in the morning? Yes, miss. l shan't sleep tonight. What an adventure. Have you seen the red men? A few. l absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having been to the wilderness. lt's so exciting, Duncan. (DRUMS BEATlNG) Alice? ALlCE: Can we rest soon? DUNCAN: Absolutely. You, there. Scout, we must stop soon. Women are tired. Not here. Two leagues. Better water. We stop there. No, stop in the glade just ahead. When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand? (SPEAKlNG HURON) Excuse me. What did you say? Magua said, understand English very well. (HlSSlNG) DUNCAN: Hold tight! Come on ! Right! To the right! (SCREAMlNG) Prepare your firearms! As three ranks! Make ready! First and second rank, present! (SOLDlERS SHOUT) Fire! (SCREAMS) (SHOUTlNG WAR CRlES) (GUNSHOTS) (GROANS) No, Duncan. ln case your aim's any better than your judgment. (GRUNTS) Your wounded should try walking on back to Albany. They'll never make a passage north. Stop it! Stop it! We need them to get out! DUNCAN: Why's he loosing the horses? Why don't you ask him? Too easy to track. They'll be heard for miles. We were headed to Fort William Henry. (CHlNGACHGOOK SPEAKlNG MOHlCAN) (SPEAKlNG MOHlCAN) We'll take you as far as the fort. We're walking out of here fast. Unless all of you'd rather wait for the next Huron war party to come by. Scout, l'd like to thank you for your help. How much further is it? Night and a bit. Appears we're well away from them. Maybe. Maybe they ain't alone. That Huron captain back there. . . The guide? He's a Mohawk. No Mohawk. He's Huron. What reason did he have to murder the girl? What? The dark-haired one. Miss Cora Munro? Murder her? He never set eyes on her before today. She's only been here a week. Blood vengeance? A reproach or insult? Of course not! How is it you were so nearby? Came across the war party. Tracked them. Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry? No. Fort Edward then? Heading west to Can-tuck-ee. There is a war on. How is it you are heading west? Well, we kind of face to the north, and real sudden-like, turn left. l thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia. The militia is fighting the French in the north ! l ain't your scout. And we sure ain't in no damn militia. Ottawa, two francais. What did you say? Mirrors, tools, the clothes. Everything was inside. They didn't take anything. And moving fast. And a war party. Let us look after them. Leave them. Whoever they are, though they're strangers, they're at least entitled to a Christian burial. They can't be left behind. Let us go, miss. l will not! l've seen the face of war before, sir, but l've not seen war made upon women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference. Miss Munro, they're not strangers. And they stay as they lay. Why didn't you bury those people? Anyone looking for our trail would see it as a sign we passed that way. You knew them well? You were acting for our benefit, and l apologize. l misunderstood you. Well, that's to be expected. My father warned me about. . . Your father? Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you. Oh, he did? He said, "Do not try to understand them." Yes. And, "Do not try to make them understand you. "That is because they are a breed apart and make no sense." (RUSTLlNG) (WHlSPERlNG) (SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Why did they turn back? Burial ground. "Breed apart. We make no sense?" ln your particular case, miss, l'd make allowance. Thank you so much. Where is your real family? They buried my ma and pa and my sisters. Chingachgook found me with two French trappers, raised me up as his own. l'm sorry. l do not remember. l wasn't but one or two. How did you learn English? My father sent Uncas and l to Reverend Wheelock's school when l was 10. Why were those people living in this defenseless place? After seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here 'cause the frontier's the only land available to poor people. Out here, they're beholden to none. Not living by another's leave. The name was Cameron. John and Alexandra Cameron. My father's people say that at the birth of the sun, and of his brother, the moon, their mother died. So the sun gave to the earth her body, from which was to spring all life. And he drew forth from her breast the stars. The stars, he threw into the night sky to remind him of her soul. So there's the Camerons' monument. My folks' too, l guess. You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it's not as l imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London. Sorry to disappoint you. No, on the contrary. lt is more deeply stirring to my blood than any imagining could possibly have been. NATHANlEL: Top of the next ridge. The fort's downhill of it. DUNCAN: The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires, and provide every comfort and desire. l cannot wait to see Papa. (EXPLOSlONS) (DlSTANT SHOUTlNG) (MEN SCREAMlNG) (MEN SHOUTlNG) (MAN SPEAKlNG FRENCH) Fire! Prepare! Point! Fire! (MEN SCREAMlNG) (MAN SHOUTlNG ORDERS) (MEN SCREAMlNG) (EXPLOSlONS) (PANlCKED SHOUTlNG) Open up. l'm Major Duncan Heyward. Captain Jeffrey Beams. Didn't expect you to make it through. Let's go to Munro. (PEOPLE SHOUTlNG) Hello, boys! Nathaniel ! l need to talk to you, Jack. MAN: Uncas! Thought you and Nathaniel weren't joining up. We didn't. Papa! Papa! Alice! Cora! Why are you here? And where the hell are my reinforcements? Get Mr. Phelps. Told you to stay away. Why did you disobey me, girls? When? How? l. . . My letter. There was none. What? There was no letter. l sent three couriers to Webb. DUNCAN: One called Magua arrived. He delivered no such message. Does Webb not even know we are besieged? Sir, Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements. What happened to you? On the George Road. Attacked. We're fine. Are you all right? Yes. What will happen here, Papa? We'll be all right, girl. This Magua led us into it. Eighteen killed. These men came to our aid. They guided us here. Thank you. Do you need anything? Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores. Some food. lndebted to you. (EXPLOSlONS) PHELPS: Miss Cora, how are you? Hello, Mr. Phelps. Mrs. McCann will get some dry clothes for you. CORA: Thank you. Go with your sister, Alice. lt'll be all right, girl. lt'll be all right. Might l inquire after the situation, sir, given that l've seen the French engineering from the ridge above? The situation is, his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. We keep our heads down while his troops dig 30 yards of trench a day. When those trenches are 200 yards from the fort and within range, he'll bring in his 15-inch mortars, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. They look to be 300 yards out. lf they're digging 30 yards a day, you have three days. Damn. Damn. This man here can make a run straight through to Webb. Three days is not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements. Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 60th to Fort Edward two days ago. Webb is at Edward? Yes, sir. That's only 12 miles away. He could have reinforcements here the day after tomorrow. You, sir, pick your man. Major Heyward will provide a diversion. l'll draft out a dispatch. Captain Beams will seek you out and give it to you later. Something else. Cameron's cabin. Frontier cabin. Came upon it yesterday. lt was burnt out, everyone murdered. lt was Ottawa, allied to the French. Aye. So? lt was a war party. That means they're gonna be attacking up and down the frontier. Thank you, sir. People here, Mohawks, settlers, have family out there. That'll be all, sir! (SPEAKlNG MOHlCAN) Things were done. Nobody was spared. Those considerations are subordinate to the interests of the Crown. A terrible feature of war here in the Americas, Major Heyward. Best keep your eye fixed on our duty, to defeat France. That hangs on a courier to Webb. (CHlLDREN SlNGlNG lN LATlN) For my children are the children of the true faith. My friendship and esteem is boundless. Tomorrow, l will sing the war song with you at the great council fire. Magua, how are things with your English friends? We're at one. Join us. Hear what Le Subtil has to tell us. The English war chief, Webb, goes to Fort Edward with 60th Regiment. He does not know that my father's army attacks Fort William Henry. Magua was successful? The other two couriers died in the forest. By now, Munro would know his dispatch did not get through. He'll send another. Grey Hair will try. Four or five, including two women, entered the fort. The Grey Hair's children were under Magua's knife. They escaped. They will be under it again. Why do you hate the Grey Hair, Magua? When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies, Magua will put his children under the knife, so the Grey Hair will know his seed is wiped out forever. My engineers are advancing the trench through the night. You may have your opportunity soon. (DlSTANT EXPLOSlONS) GUARD: Miss Cora. Gentleman looking for you. Miss Munro. Hello. May l? lt will seep, and then it's going to draw. Thank you, miss. About done holding hands with Miss Munro? We got some work to do. What are you looking at, sir? l'm looking at you, miss. Munro refused to believe what happened. He does not even want to hear it. (EXPLOSlONS) Well, he's gonna have to. Get together by the west bastion. lan, Sharitarish, Ongewasgone and William. Tight weave? Silk. Another 40 yards. (GUNSHOT) (GROANS) (PANTlNG) MUNRO: And how am l to know it wasn't a raid by common thieves? NATHANlEL: The cabin was attacked by a war party fighting with the French. They're sweeping south down the frontier attacking farms and Mohawk villages. All the men are stuck here. l need proof more convincing than this man's opinion, before l weaken the fort's defenses by releasing the militia. Chingachgook's of the same opinion about the raid. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb's reinforcements, not the presence of the colonials. l judge military matters here, not you. Your judgment is not more important than their right, under agreement with Webb to defend their farms and families. Major Heyward was there. He was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was. MUNRO: What exactly did you see, Major? l saw nothing that would lead me to the conclusion it was other than a raid by savages bent on thievery. NATHANlEL: You're a liar! Major! Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman, not a butcher. Easy for you to suppose. lt's their women and children alone on the farms, not yours! You forget yourself, sir! We're not forgetting Webb's promise. British promises are honored, and the militia will not be released, because l need more definite proof than this man's word ! Nathaniel's word's been good on this frontier a long time before you got here. This meeting is over! The militia stays. Does the rule of English law no longer govern? Has it been replaced by absolutism? lf English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better making their own peace with the French. That is sedition ! That is the truth ! l'll have you beaten from this fort. Someday l think you and l are gonna have a serious disagreement. Anyone fomenting on advocating the leaving of Fort William Henry will be hung for sedition. Anyone actually caught leaving will be shot for desertion. My decision is final ! Get out. (MEN MUTTERlNG) (KNOCK AT DOOR) Cora? (SHUSHES) l wanted to talk to you. Talk with Duncan, Cora. l must manage. l cannot be an invalid schoolgirl. Alice. l'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything. l'm sorry. l didn't mean to. . . Cora, when we come together back in England and are married and away from this place, what had to be done and said here will matter not at all. l'm certain of that. Duncan, l promised you an answer. You've complimented me with your persistence and patience. But the decision l have come to is that l'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than to surrender my own judgment. Please take this as my final answer. lt must be no. l see. (FRENCH SOLDlERS SHOUTlNG) (WOMAN HUMMlNG) lAN: Yeah, Nathaniel, but you weren't ever for being here. NATHANlEL: That's right. l saw it that way then and l see it that way now. lan, if l had kin in the settlements, hell be damn sure l'd be long gone. What do we do about being under Crown law? l believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us then is tyranny. And l will not live under that yoke. So l will stay here no longer. Anyone caught leaving the fort could be shot, so each man make your own decision. Those who are going, be back in an hour. Out the northern sally port. Strike for the east side of the swamp till you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast. Fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishes. Should've gotten out of this long ago. Got no families, Captain. Figured we'd stay and give a hand. l'll cover you from the top of the bastion. You're not coming with us? l got a reason to stay. That reason wear a striped skirt and work in the surgery? lt does. No offense, but it's a better-looking reason than you, Jack Winthrop. Push hard, 'cause you got to clear the French outpost by dawn. Good luck, Jack. (lNDlSTlNCT CHATTERlNG) Ongewasgone, are you staying? Yes. There's too many French. And so few of us to fight. Not too many to die. But we've given our word to our English fathers. (MAN COUGHlNG) (VlOLlNS PLAYlNG) (SHUDDERlNG) You, sir! As you were! (SPEAKlNG MOHlCAN) Stand off. Take him. (SPEAKlNG MOHlCAN) As you were. (SPEAKlNG MOHlCAN) He saved us. We're alive only because of him. The man encouraged the colonials to desert, in this very room, and in my presence. Sir. He is guilty of sedition. He must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children. But he knew the consequences and he stayed. Are those the actions of a criminal? Duncan, do something. He knew the penalty for his actions. He ought to pay without sending you to beg. You know he wouldn't send me. You falsely spoke of what you saw. What happened at the farm was as Nathaniel said. But not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort. And who empowered these colonials to pass judgment on England's policies in her own possessions, and to come and go without so much as a "By your leave"? They do not live their lives by your leave! They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, bearing their children along the way. You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him ! Duncan, you are a man with a few admirable qualities. But taken as a whole, l was wrong to have thought so highly of you. Cora! Cora, l would do anything l could to keep you from being hurt. But this man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon. Justice? lf that's justice, then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for the people here. You do not know what you're saying ! Yes, l do. l know exactly what l'm saying ! And if it is sedition, then l am guilty of sedition too. They're going to hang you. Why didn't you leave when you had the chance? Because what l'm interested in is right here. What can l do? Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not. lf they do not arrive, the fort will fall to the French. lf that happens, stay close to your father. Stay close to him. The French officers will try to protect the officers among the English. No. l will find you. Do not. Promise me. (DlSTANT EXPLOSlONS) The whole world's on fire. (CHATTERlNG lN FRENCH) (SPEAKlNG FRENCH) (SOLDlERS SHOUTlNG) What is it? Remember what l told you. Stay close to your father and the officers. (DRUMS BEATlNG) (OFFlCERS SHOUTlNG ORDERS) Colonel Munro, l have known you as a gallant antagonist. l am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend. And l yours, monsieur Le Marquis. Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man, it would have fallen long ago, given the superior numbers and materials. Chance has allowed me to array against you. Monsieur Le Marquis, l am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parley for a better reason than an exchange of compliments. You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your prince. But now l beg you to listen to the admonishments of humanity. l beg you to consider my terms for your surrender. Perhaps the general's glass can reach as far as the Hudson and seize the size and eminence of the army of Webb? My scouts intercepted this dispatch intended for you. Capitaine de Bougainville. "To Colonel Munro. Sir, l regret to inform you "that l have no men available to send to your rescue. "lt is quite impossible. "l advise you to seek terms for surrender. "l remain. Jerome Webb at Fort Edward." This is the signature of Webb. And l know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end. You've had your answer, monsieur Le Marquis. Sir, l beg you not to sign the death warrant of so many until you have listened to what l have to say. Go on. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They are free, so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms. Their arms? They may leave the fortress fully armed. My colors? Carry them to England with pride. Allow me to consult with my officers. l have lived to see something which l never expected. A British officer afraid to support another. Webb can burn in hell. And we'll go back and dig our graves behind those ramparts. Death and honor are thought to be the same, but today l have learned that sometimes they are not. Sir. . . Monsieur Le Marquis, l am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity. My fort is yours under the condition that l be given till dawn to bury my dead, to prepare my men and women for the long journey ahead and to hand my wounded over to your surgeons. Granted, monsieur. (SOLDlERS SlNGlNG) ls the hatchet buried between the English and my French father? Yes. Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends. My master owns these lands, and l have been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go, so now l call them enemies no longer. Magua took the hatchet to color with blood. lt's still bright. Only when it's red, then it will be buried. So many suns have set since Magua struck the war post. And where is that sun? Magua is the son of his people and he has come to lead many of them. But Magua has power with his Huron people and others here, l know well. Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English. l was taken as slave by the Mohawk who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all that. ln time, Magua became blood brother to the Mohawk to become free. But always in his heart, he is Huron. And his heart will be whole again on the day the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead. Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms? l fear having let them go, which l must, l will only fight the same men again when l drive towards Albany. But l cannot break the term of the surrender and sully the lilies of France. (THUNDER RUMBLlNG) Monsieur, the fort is yours. (SCREAMS) MAN: Left three ranks, make ready! Aim, set. (YELLS WAR CRY) (HURONS YELLlNG) Fire! Present, fire! Fire! Full company! Grey Hair,before you die, know that l will put under the knife your children, so l will wipe your seed from the Earth forever. (MUNRO GRUNTS) CORA: Leave her alone! (lNAUDlBLE) (SPEAKlNG MOHlCAN) When you fall into British hands again, l'll have you hanged ! Faster! Head to the river! DUNCAN: Where are we going? NATHANlEL: Nowhere. l don't understand. This is as far as we go. lf we're lucky, they'll figure we beached our canoes and headed cross land. lf we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls. Our only hope is that they pass us by. lf they do? Take the south rim down the mountain. lt's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward. And if they don't? You'll just have to forego the pleasure of hanging me. (SPEAKlNG MOHlCAN) Powder? Gone. (SPEAKlNG MOHlCAN) Mine's soaking wet! CORA: Our father. . . Did you see my father? From a distance. Say nothing to Alice. Get back! (GASPS) (SPEAKlNG HURON) (SPEAKlNG MOHlCAN) Yes! Go ahead ! What the bloody hell plan is this? l want you to go! lf we go, there's a chance there won't be a fight. There's no powder. lf we don't go in that, there's no chance. None! You understand? Coward ! You've done everything you can do. Save yourself! lf the worst happens. . . You stay alive! lf they don't kill you, they'll take you north up to the Huron lands. Submit, do you hear? You're strong. You survive! You stay alive, no matter what occurs! l will find you, no matter how long it takes, no matter how far! l will find you. (SPEAKlNG HURON) (NATHANlEL SHOUTlNG lN MOHlCAN) (PANTlNG) (SPEAKlNG MOHlCAN) (SPEAKlNG HURON) (PEOPLE YELLlNG) (WOMAN SHOUTlNG lN HURON) (MAGUA SPEAKlNG) l don't speak Huron. Do you speak French, Major? Yes. Translate for me into French every word as l say it. l come to you unarmed and in peace to unstuff your ears, Sachem. (DUNCAN TRANSLATlNG TO FRENCH) Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free. Take fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones. (DUNCAN TRANSLATlNG TO FRENCH) (SPEAKlNG FRENCH) (DUNCAN TRANSLATlNG TO ENGLlSH) Sachem, the French fathers made peace. Magua broke it. lt is false that the French will be friends still to the Huron. (SPEAKlNG FRENCH) (SPEAKlNG HURON) (SPEAKlNG FRENCH) (DUNCAN TRANSLATlNG TO ENGLlSH) (SPEAKlNG FRENCH) (DUNCAN TRANSLATlNG TO ENGLlSH) Would Magua use the ways of les francais and the Yengeese? (DUNCAN TRANSLATlNG TO FRENCH) Would you? Yes! Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man? Would Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Would Huron fool Seneca into taking all the furs of all the animals of the forest for beads and strong whiskey? Those are the ways of the Yengeese and the francais traders and their masters in Europe infected with the sickness of greed. Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. l am Nathaniel of the Yengeese. Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook of the Mohican people. Let the children of the dead Munro and the Yengeese officer go free. This belt, which is a record of the days of my father's people, speaks for my truth. (SPEAKlNG FRENCH) (SACHEM SPEAKlNG) (SPEAKlNG HURON) Tell him l'll trade him. Me for her! Say it. (SPEAKlNG FRENCH) (SHOUTlNG lN FRENCH) Stop it! l am La Longue Carabine! My death is a great honor to the Huron ! Take me! Did you tell him? Yes. (SPEAKS HURON) Stop! l said to take me. Take me! My compliments, sir. Take her and get out! Duncan. . . What are they doing to Duncan? Where's Alice? Alice! (ALL CHEERlNG) (SCREAMlNG) (lNAUDlBLE) Uncas! (SOBBlNG) Great Spirit and maker of all life, a warrior goes to you swift and straight as an arrow shot into the sun. Welcome him, and let him take his place at the council fire of my people. He is Uncas, my son. Tell him to be patient and ask death for speed, for they are all there but one, l, Chingachgook, the last of the Mohicans. Thanks for watching..
