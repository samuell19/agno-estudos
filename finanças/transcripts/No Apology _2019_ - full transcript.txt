Hey. How are you? Good, how are you? Good. Alex. It's so good to see you. How are you doing? I'm fine. Thanks. Alex! I thought that was you. How long has it been? Six, seven months? Yeah, about that. Well you look good, considering. Gwen. What? It's fine. Oh, there's Dawn! Dawn, Alex is here! Alex! It's so good to see you. You too. Have any of you seen Robin? Is she here? Yeah, she's up in Jessica's room. Thanks. Well, she looks better than I was expecting her to. - Hey. - Hey. - She's in a better place, okay? - Yeah. - If there's anything you need. - Thanks. Robin? Remember when we were kids? Jessica stole that bottle of whiskey from my dad? We came up here and got piss-ass drunk for the first time. Jessica threw up in the hamper. Mom was so pissed the next day when she did the laundry. When Mom and Dad died... Jessica took it pretty hard. I didn't stick around to help her. That wasn't your fault, Robin. She always had you, though. I'm sorry you had to find her like that. Now, to honour Jessica the way she would want us to. Has anyone ever told you how inappropriate you are, Gwen? People keep telling me, and I keep ignoring them. I am good with my wine, thank you. And can you guys please use coasters? Don't leave any rings. Better? I'll do a shot, for Jessica. Yeah. Robin, Alex, shots. How long are you guys staying for again? Well, we all took the week off to be here for you. And is Brian gonna be able to handle the kids for that long by himself? I don't know, I guess I'll find out when I get home. So, did you and Brian figure your shit out, then? It was a little touch-and-go, but we worked things out. What exactly happened between you two, anyways? Well, we went through a rough patch financially. I thought it would be a good idea to go back to work, but Brian didn't think so. With me working full-time, he's had no choice but to do more around the house, and take care of the kids. And let's just say he wasn't happy about it. Typical guy. Yeah, the fighting got so bad that, well, I had to take the kids to my parents' house. Guess he realized that life without me and the kids sucks. He promised to smarten up, so I gave him a second chance. Well, at least your husband's trying to work it out. Has Jason signed the papers yet? No, he's being an ass about it. He's going on about how I was unfaithful, but I know he's been slutting it up all over town. What a pig. I can kick his ass for you, if you want me to. Okay, that I would like to see. Hey, I've done it before. Remember Jessica's old college boyfriend? The one he cheated on with Sandra Reed. Kevin? Carl. That's it, Carl. What a sleaze ball. When Alex told me what he did to her, I went straight to his dorm room and kneed him in the nuts! Jess always had terrible taste in men. Mm-hmm. To my sister, Jessica. ♪ Sleep, my love now, till the sun comes up ♪ ♪ Oh it's too late to worry right now ♪ ♪ Sleep, my love, till the morning comes ♪ ♪ Let the shadows guide you through the storm ♪ Ah, shit. ♪ Elijah ♪ ♪ Always stuck inside my head. ♪ ♪ Baby won't you come to bed ♪ ♪ I know I'll see you ♪ ♪ Elijah ♪ ♪ Love's impossible to me ♪ Are you okay? Fuck, I think I twisted my ankle. Can you stand? Okay. - Oh, oh, oh, oh! - I got you. I got you. Oh my gosh. Oh, thanks... Samuel. - Sam, thanks Sam, I'm Dawn. - It's a pleasure. Do you live around here, Samuel? Yeah, I do. You? No, I'm in town for a funeral, I'm crashing at my friend's place. Well here, let me get you inside. Thanks. Look at this one. Our first camping trip we took together after high school. Thank God Robin showed up to help us make a fire. Still trying to figure out why you guys go camping without knowing how to start a fire. You'd think after what we went through as kids, you guys would know better. And I'm still trying to figure out how you can drink as much as you do and still manage to get up this early. It's called practice. You want some coffee, Robin. Fuck yes. Hey Gwen, is this a picture of your band's first gig? Look, there's your ex-boyfriend. Oh, yes. Damon. Man, I forgot how sexy he was. Him and his sick tattoo of Rick Allen. The guy from Harry Potter? What? You're thinking of the actor, Alan Rickman. No, guys, Rick Allen. The drummer from Def Leppard? Wow, you guys really need to listen to better music. No, you just haven't matured yet. You still act and dress like a rebellious teenager. Well, you guys can go fuck yourselves, because at least I know how to have fun. Hey. I know how to have fun. If being in a drunken haze is what you call fun. Oh my god, Dawn! What happened? I slipped and twisted my ankle. I told you jogging in this weather was such a bad idea. Just get me some ice, please? And who's the man candy? Oh, sorry guys, this is Samuel, he's a neighbor. He saw me fall and came to my rescue. And Samuel, these are my friends, this is Maggie, this is Gwen, that is Robin, and Alex. It's nice to meet you, Samuel. Please, make yourself at home. Thanks. It's nice to meet you ladies as well. So you live around here, Samuel? Yeah, I just moved here. Oh, thank you. It's nice to know there's a strong, heroic man just around the corner. Heel, girl. So Samuel, what do you do? I'm a- writer. Like poems and stuff? Yeah, I've written some poetry before. But at the moment, I'm working on a novel. Do you like Edgar Allen Poe? He's my favourite. You like the dark stuff, eh? It's one of my favourite writing styles. So what are you working on right now? Working on this novel, I'm just working through the plot. Let's just say- it's a tragic love story. I love a good love story. If you want, I could read it, give you some notes. I read a lot of romantic novels. Maggie, your lameness is showing. Screw you, Robin. At least I know how to read. Oh, burn. Well ladies, I would love to stay and chat, but unfortunately there's somewhere I need to be. What are you doing for dinner tonight? Maggie's cooking us homemade pasta, if you'd like to join. That sounds delicious. Shall we say 8:00? Sounds like a plan. See you ladies later tonight. - You gonna be okay? - Yeah, thanks. Hey Gwen, you have a little bit of drool right there. You okay, Alex? I'm fine, just didn't sleep well. Must be weird sleeping in Jessica's room. I'll be fine. I just need some time to process. Yeah. Me too. Remember when you and Jessica threw that house party when my parents went out of town? Yeah, that was a crazy night. I walked in here to see Jessica dancing on the table. Yeah, I remember that. That was the night she tripped and fell and broke the living room TV. And I got blamed for it, too. Mom and Dad said since I was her big sister, that I should be looking out for her. Like every bad choice she's made is somehow my fault. Do you guys think Samuel would want white wine with dinner? We only have red left from the other night. Fuck, I should've run out to get more. Gwen, take a breath. There's enough wine. I'll be drinking whiskey anyways. Oh good. Show Samuel that you're basically a guy right off the bat. That'll make me look even better. 'Cause you need all the help you can get, right? Our special guest is here. I'll get it! Hey Samuel, come on in. Hi Gwen, I brought this wine for the house. Oh, thank you. Oh, smells so good in here. Let me take your coat. Great, thank you. You're welcome. It's right over here. Oh, hey Samuel. So glad you could make it. How's your ankle? It's not too bad, it's a bit swollen, but I'll survive. It just takes me a while to get from point A to point B. Well let me help you. Oh, okay. This is so good. Thank you. It's actually my husband's favourite meal. Hard to get my kids to eat it, though, they're so picky. Well they are very lucky to have a mom like you. And don't worry, I'm sure they'll love your cooking when they get older. Do any of you ladies have kids? Oh, hell no. I ain't ready for that shit yet. Gwen is just scared of the idea of becoming an adult. I am not. No responsibilities gives me all the freedom that I need. Aha, free spirit. Exactly. Take Dawn, for example. She chose a career so demanding that we never see her anymore. And what is it that you do? I'm a registered nurse. Seems a cruel irony for the one that's a nurse to get injured. Right? This is how the universe thanks me? Awesome. So Dawn mentioned earlier that you ladies are here for a funeral. I'm sure it's a touchy subject, but I'm just curious. What happened? Our friend Jessica passed away. She was Robin's younger sister. I'm so sorry. What happened, if you don't mind me asking? She had an accident, with some razor blades in the bathtub. Robin! I think I'm gonna go to bed. Thanks for dinner, Maggie. I'm sorry I brought it up. That's okay. It's just that Alex was the one that found her. And she's having a really hard time with it. So maybe we should just be more sensitive about it. I mean, it's totally understandable. If I saw something like that, it would really mess me up. She'll find her own way to cope. Robin's in the Army. She was. She was discharged for alcohol and drug abuse. Jessica's standing next to her? Yeah, that's her. Sorry I brought that up earlier. Don't worry about it. Robin can be a bit insensitive when she drinks. Robin's always turned to alcohol when she's hurting. Doesn't really deal with pain all that well. Well, we all have our own way of coping with painful situations. Yeah, it just gets me thinking, you know? About how to deal with my own problems. What kind of problems? Mostly my divorce. What happened? Can you keep a secret? Of course. With spending all that time at the hospital, Jason and I barely saw each other, and let's just say during med school, I realized how attracted I am to doctors. And your husband? Well, when he found out, I thought he was going to be heartbroken. But he didn't really care. He'd been sleeping with others on the side, and I don't even know who cheated first. I kinda know what you're going through. You do? The last girlfriend I had cheated on me. What did you do? Well, I went out and slept with someone else. Really? Yeah, it was like, payback or something. Exactly. Yeah. Well, I should probably get going. Before you go, could you help me up to my room? With my ankle, the stairs are kinda hard. Oh, of course. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Hmm. Are you gonna help us clean up, Robin, or just stand there drinking? What's your problem, Maggie? You are my problem, Robin. How could you be so insensitive at dinner tonight? He didn't mean any harm. I just told him the truth. Quit being so sensitive about it. You were being pretty harsh, Robin. Can't you see how much you bothered Alex at dinner? Don't lecture me on what's right or wrong to say, Gwen. You can be more ignorant than me sometimes. That's so not true. Fuck both of you guys, I am not ignorant. I had your back, Maggie. It would've been nice to know you had mine. I'm sorry, Gwen. You are not as much of an ass as Robin can be. Thank you. Now was that so hard? So Samuel seems pretty cool, hey? He's really nice. Totally not your type, though. Hey, I'm not picky. I like all kinds of guys. Yes, I tend to go for the bad boys, but I like the sexy creative types too. I just hope Alex is okay. You know, just the mention of Jessica's name makes her so uncomfortable. Do you think she knows the reason why Jessica killed herself? I don't know, maybe. I mean, they were closer than any of us. Should we just ask her what she knows? Poor girl's already been through so much. She doesn't need us pestering her. But what if the reason she killed herself had to do with the incident? That was so long ago. We were just kids. Besides, we agreed not to talk about it. We put it behind us and moved on. What if Jessica didn't? Almost there, almost there. Thanks. Oh, my pleasure. Oh, what the hell. All right, Dawn. Dear Heavenly Father, please help us all get through this troubled time. I fear that Robin is slipping down another dark path, and needs your guidance now, more than ever. And comfort Alex. Help her stay strong. Help us all stay strong. Amen. ♪ Amazing grace, how sweet the sound ♪ ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪ ♪ I once was lost ♪ ♪ But now I'm found ♪ ♪ Was blind but now I see ♪ Pass that joint. Okay, you know what would be good right about now? What? Food. Chips. Ice cream. Cake. No, I want chips. We had cake the other day. Oh, hey, I think I saw some earlier, actually. - Hold up, hold up. - It's dark. Guys, guys, guys, I think I hear someone coming. You're being paranoid. Busted. Check out what I snuck in. What the hell's that stuff? Shut up and take a swig. Share that joint. Come on Jess, just drink it. Shut up, Robin. Drink it, drink it! Drink it! Drink it! Drink it! Drink it! Drink it! Oh my god, that's nasty shit! But it makes church less boring. I'll be home in just a few days. Love you, Mommy. Love you guys. I miss you so much. - Bye Mommy. - I love you, Mommy. Bye. What the fuck, Robin? You can't sit over there? Nope. I like the couch. Whatever. There she is. And how was your night? Why are you looking at me like that? Don't play dumb. Is he still here? What are you talking about? Dawn and Samuel had sex last night. What? You guys had sex? Guess you missed your chance, Gwen. So how was he? I don't really wanna talk about it right now. That bad, huh? No, he was awesome. Though I did wake up by myself this morning, but- She he banged ya and ditched ya. That's gotta be rough. Shut up, Gwen. He probably just had somewhere to be. Don't be jealous. I'm not jealous. Maybe it's Samuel, coming to apologize for walking out on you this morning. Can I help you? Good morning. I'm Detective Miles Lancaster. Is Robin Hayward here? Yeah. She's in the living room. May I speak with her? Of course. Please, come on in. I'm Detective Miles Lancaster. May I speak with you in private, please? Sure. Well, I've been looking closer into your sister's death, and I've come across some things that just don't quite add up. Like what? Well, we found high levels of Adavan in Jessica's system. Yeah. She was taking it to help her with her anxiety. Well, on the night she died, we found a dose that was five times her recommended amount. So what? Maybe she tried to kill herself with the pills, and when that didn't work, she decided to slit her wrists. With the amount she took, it would've put her in an almost comatose state. I don't believe she would've been capable of cutting her own wrists. Are you saying someone else cut her wrists? It's a possibility. Do you know anyone who'd want to... No. I don't know anyone that would want Jess dead. Everyone loved her. Robin, what's going on? Robin, slow down. What's the matter? It's Jessica. They think she's been murdered. Jess. Murder? Nothing is for sure yet. I'm just wanting to explore every possibility. Do you ladies have any information that might help us in our investigation? Like what? Any of you know anyone who'd want to hurt Jessica. Did she have any enemies? No one comes to mind. How long did you ladies know Jessica? We grew up together. Same school, same church. Thank you, Ms.-? Alex Palmer. Palmer? Your father wouldn't happen to be George Palmer? He is. I attend your father's church. He's a good man. I don't think I've ever seen you at the church before. I don't go anymore. I see. I was there when your father's old church burned down. What a terrible night. Well. If you ladies think of anything, please give me a call. And give your father my best. Thank you, Detective. Oh my god. I can't believe that he was there at the church. Relax, Maggie. Everyone thinks the fire started because of the lightning storm, so that's what happened. Yeah. Besides, he's looking into Jessica's death, not what happened at the church 16 years ago. Yeah. You're right. Do you guys really think Jessica could've been murdered, though? I mean, who would want to kill Jessica? She was like, the nicest person ever. Was she, though? What do you mean? Well, not only was she constantly screwing over Robin when they were growing up, but she was getting really close with my husband these last couple months. You think Jessica was interested in Jason? I couldn't see her doing something like that, though. Guys, the detective's just being paranoid. Jess couldn't deal with what happened when we were kids, it fucked her up so much, and when her parents died, it just pushed her over the edge. She opened up to me about it a couple times. She wasn't handling it very well. You're probably right. Just wonder how Robin's taking all of this. She stormed out of here pretty upset. Well, I'm gonna go look for her. All this time I've been blaming myself. If I would've just took the time to see her, to listen to what she was going through, maybe she'd still be here. You can't live your life wondering what if. But what if the detective is on to something? Things are getting pretty tense in there. How's it going out here? Better, I guess. Samuel managed to calm me down. Samuel to the rescue again. I'm just doing what anyone would. I appreciate it. Hey Robin, did you know Jessica was really close with Dawn's husband? She was? Yeah, Dawn just told us. Yeah, Dawn mentioned it to me the other night that her husband was cheating on her. Maybe Jessica was one of Jason's mistresses? Hey, Robin. You okay? Did you kill Jessica? What? You heard me. Did you murder my sister because she's sleeping with your husband? Are you seriously asking me this? Just answer the question. I think you've had a bit too much to drink, again. Just answer the fucking question. Of course not. And fuck you for even asking me that. Samuel, what are you doing here? Well, I was worried about you. I wanted to see how you were doing. You know what I need. What? A distraction. God, I hate church. So depressing. At least your family only makes you come here on special occasions. My dad's the reverend. I have to come here every Sunday, whether I want to or not. Yeah, that sucks. My parents were pissed when I quit coming every Sunday. At least they still have their golden child, though. Don't call me that. I hate church just as much as you do. In fact, I probably hate it even more than you do. All right, little badass, prove it. Do something to prove how rebellious you are against this place. Fine. I will. Prove it, then, mmm. Nice try, but that's not good enough. Hey, that's my whiskey you're wasting there. What are you doing? Holy shit, Jessica. You're crazy. I'm impressed, sis. Now give me back my whiskey. Crazy. You're insane. Thank you so much for seeing me, Dr. Zimmerman. It's not a problem, Detective Lancaster. I just hope I can be of some assistance. Now, you had some questions about Jessica Hayward? Yes. How long was Jessica your patient? About 15 years. - Long time. - Yes. I thought we were making progress. Suicide. We have reason to believe her death may not have been a suicide. Fuck's sakes. A little help would be nice. Hello? Everything all right? Oh. Yeah, everything's fine. Just a little spill. Let me help you. Thanks. What did you bring? I brought you my homemade vegetarian casserole. How did you know I was vegetarian? Dawn must've said something. Oh. Well, that is so sweet of you. What is with you always coming to the rescue? Just my thing, I guess. Well you are so much more considerate than my husband. I get about the same amount of respect from him as I do from my friends. You know, I'm just trying to be here to support Alex and Robin, and they're not making it very easy. Well maybe I can help. How? I have my ways. I was hoping you could share her files with us. There's a good chance they contain important information that could lead us to the truth about what happened to Jessica. I see. Unfortunately, doctor-patient confidentiality prevents me from sharing that kind of information. I'll get a warrant, then. Do you mind if I ask you one more question before I go? Of course. How long had you been prescribing Jessica Adavan? Oh, I've been prescribing it to her since her parents brought her to me. She suffered from serious depression as a teenager. What caused her depression? We rooted it back to a church fire she witnessed where several people died. I believe she suffered from survivor's guilt. Survivor's guilt? You know, when others died, but you were the one who was spared. Did she lose someone that day? No one close to her. Her family and friends made it out safely. I think the thing that got to her was the death of a seven-year-old boy who never made it out of the fire. I believe his name was Lucas King, or Kingly. Kingsley. Yes. And he was only five. Did you know the boy? Lucas- was my son. Oh. He kept his mother's name after he was born. We never married. I'm so sorry for your loss. It was almost 20 years ago. Still. Those tragedies stay with us. Yes. They do. I heard the music and I had to come check it out. Thank you. What are you doing here? I brought over an apple pie for Maggie, which I baked this morning. That was nice of you. I didn't know you baked. Every now and then. I guess I'll have to find out if you're any good at it. I'm not the only one with a hidden talent. That song you were playing, did you write that? You're really good. Do you play in a band? Yeah. Well, I used to. Used to. What happened? Oh, I don't know. It feels good to get things off your chest when things are bothering you. I've kinda been dealing with a serious gambling addiction. Really? Yeah. Got really outta control there for a while. You got one week to bring me the money you owe us. One week. I hurt a lot of people. My band got tired of dealing with me, so they kicked me out. I'm sorry. I'm just scared people are gonna judge me when I tell them this kinda shit, you know? Don't worry, Gwen. Your secret's safe with me. Oh hey, Samuel. What are you doing here? Just thought I'd pop in and say hi. Can I talk to you for a minute, alone? Of course. Oh my god. Isn't he such a sweetheart? I know. I don't know about that. You didn't say anything to anybody, did you? About us? No. I don't kiss and tell. I believe in discretion. Well I appreciate it. But why did it happen? What do you mean? You kinda threw yourself at me. I wasn't really expecting it. I was really drunk, and upset at Dawn. I guess I wanted to get back at her. About what happened with your sister? That's the thing, I don't know what happened. I just have this hole in the pit of my stomach. I can't shake the feeling. You know, you should talk to this detective. Maybe he can dig up some dirt for you. This is Detective Miles Lancaster. Sorry I missed your call, but if you leave your name and number, I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Hi, Detective Lancaster. This is Robin Hayward. I needed to talk to you, in regards to Jessica's death. I may have some information that could help with the investigation. If you could give me a call back, that'd be great. She severed both the Ulnar artery and the radial artery in each of her wrists. Which caused her to bleed out. I'm so sorry for your loss, Miss Hayward. What's the rush, Alex? It's nothing. Alex, what's going on? You've been avoiding me all day. Have I? It's not really my place to say. What is? I'm just worried about Robin. I overheard her leaving a voicemail for the detective. What did she say? That she had some information about Jessica's death. What kind of information? I'm not sure exactly. I bet it's about Jason and Jessica's relationship. She got drunk last night and accused me of killing Jessica out of jealousy. But that's crazy. I could get arrested for those kind of accusations. We need to talk to her before she says or does something that she's gonna regret. Dr. Zimmerman? Detective Lancaster is here to see you. Send him in. Come in, Detective, come in. A warrant, for Jessica Hayward's personal files. Very well. These are her files from the past year. I'll have to get the rest from storage. I hope these help. Thank you, Doctor. Detective, before you leave, I'd like to ask you a question. Yes? Given your personal history with Jessica Hayward... Personal history? The fire. You lost a son that day. I wouldn't want your grief interfering with the integrity of Miss Hayward's case. Only reason that would happen is if Miss Hayward caused the fire. The church burned down due to a lightning storm. They found no proof of arson. Of course. Good luck, Detective. Hi, Detective Lancaster, this is Robin Hayward. I needed to talk to in regards to Jessica's death. What do we even say to her? How about "mind your own fucking business and don't say something that could get us all arrested?" How was your affair gonna get us all arrested? You best believe if I'm going down, I'm taking all of you guys with me. What the hell is wrong with you, Dawn? It's not like you to be so - Sadistic. - Yeah. What's the matter with you? What, I'm not allowed to be pissed when someone accuses me of murder? That is not what we're saying. Well hear what I'm saying. Any one of you speaks out against me with the detective, and you're all gonna regret it. So what do we do about Robin? How do we get her to keep her mouth shut about Jessica and Jason? We can't let the cops find out about the affair. We can't let the cops find out about the church. Why would she say anything about that? Because Robin's really angry, and clearly not thinking right. She doesn't even know that the detective was there when it happened. She clearly wants someone to blame for what happened to Jessica. What if she does say something? Would she really do that, though? Do what? Tell the detective how we burned down the church when we were kids? Or how Dawn murdered my sister because her husband couldn't keep it in his pants? I didn't fucking murder your sister, so you'd better not bring any of this shit up with the detective, or else. Or else what? Or else I'll tell them that you killed Jessica and tried to put this all on me. Why would I want to kill Jessica? Oh, come on, Robin. We all know you resented Jessica. She was the golden child who could do no wrong, and that pissed you off, so you left, and when you couldn't even hack it in the military, your parents disowned you. And when they died, they left everything to Jessica. They didn't leave you anything, because you're a waste of skin. You don't know shit. So shut your fuckin' mouth. You had nothing, and when Jessica died, you inherited everything. You've got just as much a motive to want her dead as I do, so you better not say anything to the detective. Miss Hayward, it's Detective Lancaster. Is everything all right in there? Shit, what if he heard us? Relax, we don't know if he heard exactly what we were talking about, so just calm down. Detective. I heard yelling. Is everything all right? It's great. Just having a little argument. Nothing to concern yourself with. Is Robin Hayward here? I need to speak with her. Of course. Come on in. Ms. Hayward. I got your message. If you like, I can take you down to the station, and you can make a statement on the record. Ehm- I'm sorry to waste your time. I made a mistake. I was just about to call you to clear things up. What is it you were gonna tell me? It's nothing. I thought I remembered Jessica get into a fight with someone before she died, and then I remembered I was really drunk and can never get my story straight. I see. And this person you thought Jessica was fighting with. Was this a friend of hers? I don't know. When I drink, things get jumbled. I know you women are hiding something, and if you're not willing to tell me, I assure you, I will uncover the truth. Good job, Robin, now the detective is suspicious of us. I know. I fucked up. I don't know what I was thinking. Maybe you should learn to keep your mouth shut. I got it, Dawn, but maybe you should learn to shut your fucking mouth before I shut it for you. Okay, okay guys, let's just take it down a notch. We can't turn on each other. Especially with the cops watching us now. She's right. We need to have each other's backs right now. Oh, who the fuck is that now? It's okay, guys. It's just Samuel. Hey ladies. Why does it feel so tense in here? What's going on. It's just the detective drilling us about Jessica's death. Does he still think that it wasn't a suicide? Yeah. Well I'm sure the truth will come out eventually, right? Anyways, the reason that I came over was I wanted to talk to... Oh, Samuel, now is not a good time, can we talk later? Actually, I wanted to talk to Gwen. Me? Why? Well, I wanted to interview you, for my book. I want one of the characters to be a musician, so- Wow, really? That would be so cool. Ehmm- Now is not the best time for this. Hey, I could use a distraction from all of our drama. I just don't think we should be talking to anyone right now. We don't even know this guy. Relax, Maggie, it'll be fine. You should quit worrying so much. Is there a private place we can talk? Yeah, there's a great spot upstairs we can talk in. Oh, great. So how long have you been a musician? Well, I've been playing guitar since I was nine. I joined a band when I was 16, bounced around a little bit. And you performed with your last band for how long? About seven years? We toured for a while before they kicked me out. Again. Sorry about that. But if it's all right with you, I'd like to talk about your gambling problems. Is this gonna go in your book? No. I'm just brainstorming. Well, I guess it all started when we did a tour through Vegas. I gambled every night that we were there. I stole all the band's money and gambled it away. I lost almost five grand that week. And it got a lot worse. A few times a month, Jessica would come down and join me, and we would gamble away more money. Jessica gambled too? I actually got her into it. But don't tell the others though, okay? I don't mean to pry. I'm just interested in you. That's okay. I feel oddly comfortable around you. It's weird, I don't talk about this kinda stuff with anyone. Maybe we just understand each other. Man. Gwen and Samuel have been talking for a while. Are you jealous? Of course not. What Samuel and I had was nothing more than a fling. Yeah, right. Who are you trying to convince, us or yourself? Shut up, Robin. Oh, guys get a lot accomplished? Oh, our time was very productive. In fact, I'm gonna head home right now, work on my story. Sure you don't want to stay for supper? No, I should probably get home. But thanks for talking to me, Gwen. Ladies, enjoy your night. So, what did you two talk about? Just my life as a musician. And that's it? Yeah. Don't lie to me, Gwen. We been friends for a long time. You don't think that I know what your sex hair looks like? You guys had sex?! A little bit. What the fuck, Gwen?! I thought we were friends. How could you do that to me? I thought you and Samuel were nothing more than a fling. Okay, stay out of this, Robin. This has nothing to do with you. Well, it kinda does. What do you mean? Well I didn't think I was gonna have to say anything, but the other night I came downstairs to get some water and I saw Robin and Samuel on the couch. Doing it? What the fuck, Robin? You saw us? Why didn't you say anything, Alex? Why does it have to be my place to say anything? It's not my fault you guys are just throwing yourselves at this guy. Oh, screw you, Alex. You think you're so much better than all of us. Always trying to make us feel sorry for you. Wait, how did I become the bad guy? Where is this coming from? You're always playing the sympathy card. Ever since you found Jessica dead in the tub. Maybe you should just get over yourself. Dawn, what the hell is wrong with you? Alex! Alex! Alex, where are you? What's going on? Dawn said something that really upset Alex, and now I can't find her. I'll help you look for her. Okay. Alex! Alex! I can't believe you guys both slept with him. You're such a bunch of backstabbing bitches. Fuck you, Dawn. You're the biggest slut here. Almost as much as your trampy-ass husband. Screw you, Robin. You act like you're so innocent, Dawn, but you are just as bad as Jason. Oh, and you're so perfect, Gwen? You pretend like you're so cool and chill, but you're actually so insecure. I am not! God. You two are so whiny and dramatic. I can't handle it anymore. Alex! Alex! Where could she have gone? I'm sure she can take care of herself. I just worry about her. You know, Jessica's death really messed her up. They were best friends, they did everything together. I think she blames herself for Jessica's suicide. So you still think it was a suicide? Of course. The fact that Jessica was going through all of that and none of us even noticed. Well, the unexamined life is not worth living. You know, you're actually very wise. I can see why the others like you so much. Come on, Alex, answer your phone. I hope your husband knows how lucky he is to have you. Stop. Come on, Maggie. Not only are you beautiful, you're nice, you're nurturing, you're generous. I think that you're the glue that holds your group of friends together. You really think that? I really do. We shouldn't. We should. Maggie, what the hell are you doing? Sorry, I should really go. Honestly, I don't even know what came over me, I mean, one minute, we were talking, and the next, I don't even know how this happened! It's like I wasn't even in control of my body. You won't say anything, will you Robin? You know, I thought you were more responsible than this. But it turns out, you're just as fucked up as the rest of us. Hey Alex, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Do you wanna talk about it? Not really. Robin said Dawn upset you. Is this about Jessica? Look, just because everybody else comes to you with all of their problems, doesn't mean I'm going to. Why don't you just leave me alone? I just wanna help. Well I don't need your help. You know, it's okay to feel angry. Dealing with suicide can be challenging. When people fall to such a low place in their lives, it's unfortunate to know that they think suicide is the only way out. There's but one philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Did you just quote Albert Camus to me? Very good, you know your philosophers. And here I thought you were only into poetry. Why is Edgar Allen Poe your favourite poet? Well, I just love how dark and unique his writing is. All of his stories are so- mysterious, full of emotion, drama. He does have a recurring theme of death and lost love to his writing, doesn't he? Yeah. Maybe that's something you can relate to? You know, he was Jessica's favourite poet as well. When we were younger, we used to hide pages of his poems in our bibles at church, so we'd have something interesting to read. My father found out, burned all of my copies, hit me with his own Bible. Hit me so hard he broke two of my fingers. Why did I just tell you that? I've never told anyone that. Because it feels good to tell the truth. Secrets and lies poison the soul, but- you know that. Dr. Zimmerman. It's Detective Lancaster. Hello, Detective. I know it's late, but I found something in Jessica's files that may lead somewhere. You've written down here that one of the therapeutic techniques you used that has been helping with Ms. Hayward is writing down thoughts and dreams in journals. Would you happen to know where these journals might be? Yes. She would give them to me to store. Didn't trust her family and friends not to snoop and read her personal thoughts and feelings. I believe they're with the rest of her files. Did you happen to read any of these journals? Usually I'd want to read what a patient would write down. But she wanted them to remain private, and I respected her wishes. When was the last time she gave you one of these journals? Around the time her parents passed away. Doctor, I need to see these journals, immediately. Jessica? Alex. Alex. Alex. Alex. Are you okay? We've been looking everywhere for you. We've been worried sick. Yeah right. Don't be like that, Alex. You have no idea what I'm going through. None of you do. I see Jessica everywhere. I can't sleep, I can't even use the upstairs bathroom without seeing her dead body in the tub. Alex, I'm sorry about what I said earlier. Dawn, don't bother apologizing, I don't need it. You all have your issues you need to deal with, so just leave me and my problems alone. What problems are you talking about, Alex? You don't honestly believe that Jessica didn't tell me everything. What do you mean? Don't play dumb, Gwen. You think I don't know about the gambling problem you and Jessica got into? What gambling problem? You knew about that? Of course I did! Jessica told me everything! We were best friends. You got my sister into gambling? Is this what caused Jessica to get into such bad debt? Yeah, Gwen got her into so much debt, she had to borrow 10 grand from Maggie. She borrowed money from you? Yeah, and she never paid me back. When Brian found out, it almost ruined our marriage. At least she didn't steal it from you. Jessica stole money from you? The last time we were in Vegas, she stole $10,000 of my winnings and gambled it away. I needed that money to pay back my own debt. That sounds like something you'd kill someone over. Are you fucking kidding me, Robin? Are you seriously accusing me of murdering Jessica because she stole some money from me? Some money? Try ten thousand, Gwen. What's your point, Dawn? I'd be pretty pissed if someone stole 10 grand from me. Almost as angry as you were when you found out that Jessica was sleeping with your husband? Haven't we moved past this? Of course we haven't. First I find out Jessica's death might not be a suicide, and now I'm finding out all of you have reason to have wanted her dead? What, like you didn't have a reason to want her dead? Don't you dare bring up that whole inheritance thing. I loved my sister. But did you really? Come on. All this is proving is how little you actually knew your sister. You weren't there for her. And if this was a suicide, you're most likely the reason as to why she killed herself in the first place. I don't think Jessica killed herself. I can feel it. You really believe we're capable of murder? We are murderers, Maggie. Just admit it to yourself. That wasn't murder, Robin. That was an accident. We're all going to hell. Might as well own it, right? You've lost your goddamn mind, Robin. Have I? Because you've yet to deny killing Jessica. You really need to hear me say it? Fine, I didn't kill Jessica. Why would I? She borrowed money from me and didn't pay me back? Come on, Robin, get your head out of your ass! Oh, fuck you, Maggie. Maybe your marriage almost ended because you're just as much of a slut as the rest of us. What? Yeah. Maggie and Samuel would've fucked earlier if I hadn't interrupted them. Oh my god, really Maggie? It was just a kiss, just one, and it meant nothing. You try to pretend to be Miss Perfect. But you're not. Well at least I don't run from my problems like a coward. You asking for another shot, bitch? Guys. Calm down. Jessica wouldn't want us to fight like this. But she would want us to be honest with each other. You know what? You guys aren't worth my time. I want you all out of the house first thing in the morning. Robin, don't be like that. No. Fuck you guys. None of you were true friends to my sister. She would've been better off without all of you. Oh, and you're so much better than we are, Robin? You wanna know the truth? The truth is your sister deserved what she got. What the fuck did you just say? I said Jessica deserved to die. She fucked over her friends. She ruined my marriage. She almost ruined mine too. She stole all my money. You're all terrible people! You selfish assholes. Take responsibility for your own mistakes instead of blaming someone else. Dawn, Jessica never slept with Jason. Jason cheated on you because of your selfish attitude. And Maggie, maybe you should've asked your husband before loaning Jessica $10,000, instead of just giving it to her. Your marriage didn't suffer because Jessica took that money. It suffered because you and Brian don't know how to communicate. Gwen, you were the one who got Jessica into gambling in the first place. She stole that money to give it back to Maggie, only to lose it to the thugs that you owed it to. Robin, you knew how long Jessica was suffering for. That incident at the church messed her up so much. What did you do? You left the first chance you got. None of you were there for her. I was the only one who tried to help her. I was the only one who knew exactly what she was going through. Jessica killed herself because of all of you. Put the gun down, Robin. Why didn't you stop her? Robin, just calm down and give me the gun. Not until I find out what happened. I just told you! - Alex! - Just let her go. Damn, Robin hit you pretty good. Can you believe her? She coulda killed us! What was she thinking, bringing out a gun like that? Yeah, freaked us all out. First thing tomorrow morning, I'm heading home. I don't feel safe around here anymore. I don't blame you. Do you think Alex was right about Jessica stealing my winnings to give back to you? I don't know. Could you believe Alex, though? She just snapped on us. Maybe she's right, though. Well maybe we aren't taking responsibility for our actions. We just pretend like it never happened. I just blame others for my mistakes. What, like kissing Samuel? At least I didn't have sex with him. Unlike you guys who just threw yourselves at him without any hesitation whatsoever. I don't even know what came over me. It's like I wasn't in control of my thoughts and actions. I felt the same way. He took advantage of us. How can somebody do that and still manage to sleep at night? All the terrible stuff we've done? How is that we can manage to sleep at night? I just thought he was cool, you know? The assholes always manage to disguise themselves as the nice guy. It's hard to pick the angels from the demons. Where are you? I know you're out here! Watching us, playing with us. I know who you are! Why are you doing this to us? You know why. The journals should be in here somewhere. Thanks for doing this so early in the morning. It's fine, Detective. I wanna know what happened to my patient just as much as you do. I appreciate the help, regardless. This should be it. Could you? Thank you. Take a look. Thank you. Jessica? Hello Alex. I'm so sorry. I did everything I could. I did everything you asked me to. I don't understand why this is happening. Yes you do. Deep down you know exactly why. The church? ♪ Amazing grace, how sweet the sound ♪ ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪ God, I hate this place. I am so tired of my parents trying to turn me into something I'm not. I just wish that they would accept me for who I am, but they won't, and it's all that stupid religion's fault. Hey, I feel the same way. They'll never accept us. Robin and Jessica, where are you? Shit. It's Dad. Put the fire out! It's Dad, come on! Robin. Alex. Lucas! Lucas, where are you? Lucas! Miles, we have to go. All the kids are outside, let's go. Ow. Dad! Mommy, where are you? Detective? What is it? It was them. Who? Jessica, and her friends, they burned it down. The church? My son. They're the reason my son is dead. Detective. Wait. You killed those people, Alex. A child died because of you. And you led me to believe that it was all my fault. I never meant for anyone to get hurt. I just wanted to see that building burn. Like you wanted. It's not the building that we hated. It's what the building represented. It was the people that would sit there and judge us. They never would've accepted us, Jessica, not ever. I accepted you, Alex. Is that not enough? You never loved me like I loved you. You? You're the one punishing me? Yes. I'm punishing all of you. Which one of you took it? Took what? Don't play dumb. My gun. I put it in my bag and the next thing you know it's gone. How do you lose a gun? I didn't lose a gun, Maggie. Someone stole it. Now who was it? We didn't take your gun, Robin. We've been here the whole time. Well if you didn't take it, then who did? You are all sinners, so easily corrupted. Even poor sweet Maggie. But none of them compares to you. Everything I did, I did for Jessica. Even when she was pretending to be someone else, no matter how bad it got. I was the only one who was truly there for her. We have to take all of them. Read it to me again. Just the ending. I want the ending. But our love was stronger by far than the love of those who were older than we, of the many far wiser than we. Neither the angels in Heaven above, or the demons down under the sea, could ever dissever my soul from the soul of the beautiful Annabel Lee. And so all the nighttide, I lie down by the side of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride, in the sepulcher down by the sea, in her tomb by the sounding sea. I gave her a way out. A chance to be at peace. But you haven't found peace yet, have you? The boundaries which divide life from death are at best shadowy and vague. Who shall say where the one ends and the other begins? We loved with a love that was more than love, I and my Annabel Lee. With a love that the winged seraphs of Heaven coveted her and me. And neither the angels in heaven above or the demons down under the sea shall never dissever my soul from the soul of the beautiful Annabel Lee. You said you know who I am. The angel of destruction. You know what you need to do. Detective. What are you doing here? I need you and your friends to answer some more questions. Why are there so many police officers here? Wait, what the hell's going on here? Spread out. Check everything. Stay sharp, boys. Detective, what's going on? Bring them into the living room. What's this all about? Where's Alex Palmer? We don't know. Search the house. Don't know where she is. Sit down. One of you is responsible for Jessica's death. For all I know, you could've all conspired to kill her. You fuckin' serious? Does this look serious enough for you? All of you had motive to kill Jessica Hayward, whether it was for an inheritance, a large debt to pay back, a score to settle, or even out of jealousy. I wasn't jealous of Jessica. What, so she was sleeping with my husband. So what? She could have the jerk for all I cared. Jessica wasn't sleeping with your husband. Jessica Hayward was a homosexual. Jess was gay? None of you knew? Now according to Jessica's files I recovered from her therapist, your husband tried to sleep with Jessica, many times, until she finally had to come clean to him about her sexual preference. I also read about Jessica's financial problems with you two. You stole $5,000 from your band. Jessica tells them, they kick you out, and then she steals double that from you, to deal with her debt to your friend Maggie over here. Did you know any of this was happening to your own sister when you abandoned her when you were 21? I didn't abandon her. I was forced to leave. Yes, it must've made you angry when your parents blamed you for Jessica losing so much of their money to support her gambling addiction. She said it was you, and they believed her over you because you were a struggling alcoholic who needed money for her booze. Why wouldn't they believe Jessica over you? They kicked you out. Sent you to the military to finally learn some discipline. You get discharged, they disown you entirely, and they leave everything to your lying sister. Yes, that must have made you very angry indeed. I might've not loved my sister as much as I said I did, but I didn't kill her. I think you did. I think all of you did. Kind of like how you killed my son in that church fire. All of you attended the same church that burnt down to the ground, killing half a dozen people, including my five-year-old son! None of you came forward. Jessica even threatened some of you with your little secret to get what she wanted from you. Like money. Hard to trust a group of people who could keep a secret like that. We all had issues with Jessica, yes, but... We didn't kill her! Whether you held the blade or not, you're all responsible for her death. Even if you didn't kill her, you pushed her- towards suicide. I may not be able to charge you yet for the murder of Jessica Hayward, but you are all under arrest for the burning of Smithsgrove Community Church, and will each be charged with arson and manslaughter. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you do say can be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to consult a lawyer, and have that lawyer present during questioning. We'll find her. She left her cell phone and other belongings behind. She can't have gone far. Hey Lancaster, we found her. Excellent. Where is she? Follow me. What the hell? Found this as well. "And now I join my Annabel Lee." What does that even mean? Not sure. I can only assume. Why you think she did it?
