Two trout, one wife, that's all a man can reasonably ask of his maker. (chuckles) (phone beeping) Anything for me? Nope, nothing work related. A message from Cassie. Oh, where is she now? "East godforsaken Minnesota" was how she put it. (chuckles) She loves to tease you. Well, I don't mind the teasing. A little bit more geographically specific wouldn't hurt. Oh, you need to know more than the fact that she lives in a van with three guys you've never met? Singing songs you can't understand. Yeah, yeah. You know, you take everything in your stride. Me? I... I hit every hurdle. I did my hard time between 13 and 18. Those five years when she was daddy's darling? Not that she wasn't mine, you understand. She was tough on you. Tough? She was brutal! The girl did not want to be my daughter. She would have loved it if she had been found outside your church wrapped in brown paper. Except she still wanted you to be her father.

(dog whining) Oh, Cassie. We should've been sisters. Then you could hate me without the hard feelings. (crickets, bird chirping) (dog barking) (footsteps approaching) Mm, hi. Hi. Real bad? Well, pre-real bad. The family was glad she was home. You know Daniel, um... something funny happened on the river in the boat. What? Well, I was lying there. And, um... I wasn't asleep. I was conscious, actually. And, I don't know... I was just thinking about where life takes us, on its current. Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Anyway, I was inside and outside at the same time. I was in and outside of my life. Life is but a dream. It was like a dream. But then all of a sudden I found myself... I just... I think I went out of my body, and I was way above the river, and I looked down, and I could see the boat, and you in it, but I wasn't there. (water running) I wasn't in the boat. Don't you think that's weird? It was hot. You were daydreaming. It happens. But, you know, it seemed like... it was some kind of a premonition. A premonition? Of what? I don't know. Well, maybe you were thinking about death. And maybe the boat you were in was your life, or marriage, or... No, it was more like we had never met, and I had taken a different path. I'm glad you didn't. Me too. Why didn't you tell me this at the time? Because it was scary, looking down and not seeing myself in the boat. Well, honey, we're both in the same boat. Wow. Where did that come from? Honey, I'm sorry, I can't match it tonight. I'm just... It's all right. There'll be other nights. Mmm. Oh. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Cassie used to like that too... once upon a time. (dog yipping) Take your temp... (meows) Oh, it's normal. You get to go home. Call Mrs. Truscott and tell her to pick him up. Mm-hmm. Come on, sugar. Well, I can't believe you got Evelyn Truscott to cut off that cat's marbles. (both chuckling) Yep, no more unwanted kittens. Don Juan is officially retired. The preacher's wife performs yet another miracle. Yeah, hardly. What have you got for me? We got a new patient. His name is Arthur. His back legs won't work. Can you have Jordan bring him back? Mmm-hmm. Sure. (Jordan) Right in here, sir. Okay, thanks. On the table's fine. The doctor will be right with you. Thanks. I'm Dr. Beckett. Joanne. And this is... Arthur? Hello, Arthur. What seems to be the problem with Arthur? Well, he... he seems to be paralyzed. I was traveling for quite a while, and I finally came home and found him like this. My wi... My wife wasn't paying much attention, I'm afraid. Excuse me, Mr. Mayhew. Is that Eli Mayhew? Yes. Alicia Stead. Oh, my goodness. Of course you are. Um... Well, you've changed. Yeah, well it's been almost 30 years, hasn't it? Yeah. But, your name's... your name is Joanne? Well, it... I just wasn't quite who I seemed to be in those days. So, do you live here now? We just moved here. I mean, I work in Boston, but we live here now. Well, while we get over our astonishment, let's concentrate on Arthur here. Yeah. He's on cortisone. He's had arthritis for a number of years, which is probably why my wife didn't think much of him not moving around. When I came back and saw him... I mean, he can't move his back legs. He has no feeling in them at all as far as I can tell. When they've lost motor response like this, it's very serious. I should've brought him in sooner. You know I looked at the X-Rays, and when there's this much neurological damage, we have to consider surgery, but I need to tell you that that is serious, and invasive, and... we can never guarantee the success of it. What are the odds? It's a long shot. Given Arthur's age, the anesthetic could even prove too much. And if we don't do anything? If we do nothing, then you have an invalid dog, which is similar to an invalid human. You just have to take care of them, keep them clean, make sure they get a lot of exercise. How can he exercise if he can't walk? Oh, well we have prosthetics now. These little carts that support the hind quarters of the animal. No, that's not possible. Well the only other option is, um... to put him down. Put him down? I know, pick the word. None of them are very pleasant. You know, I can tell you this though... You don't have to make a rush decision. Arthur is in no pain. Could I... Could I be alone with him just for a minute? Of course you can. I'll just be in the other room. Thanks. You could do this now? Yes, if that's what you've decided, but like I said, he's not in pain. Um, just push this buzzer when you're ready and I'll come back. Okay. Hey, buddy... Oh, my goodness. (indistinct chatter) So what happened to the big guy? Did he go out the back door? No, he's still here. What? He could be back there snapping up stuff, for all you know. I don't think so. I've known him for a long time, well before I was Mrs. Beckett. Oh. So... he's an old flame, then? No. We just lived in the same house in Boston in the 70's. So you were hippies together? Yeah! (both chuckling) I can't imagine anyone calling Eli Mayhew a "hippie." Hippie. (laughing) Hey, Beatty. Uh-huh. You believe in premonitions? Girl, please. No. I believe that some things happen 'cause they were meant to happen, but premonitions? No. That's just superstition. Or voodoo? (buzzing) Don't let me work no roots on you. Gotta go. Watch it. Does it take long? No, it's quick. I should warn you, it's shockingly quick. But it'll be painless. Okay. You sure? Yeah. As sure as I'm ever gonna be. All right, so you just... What? Just hold his head. Come here, buddy. Come here, buddy. That's perfect. You know, I was telling him that at any given time... There are only seven great dogs in the world, and he's one of 'em. And I've been really lucky to know him... Did you know that, about the seven great dogs? Yes, I'd heard that. Oh, God... that was quick. Yeah, it is. Thank you. Okay. Would you like me to make arrangements... No, that's okay. Is there... Is there a back way out? Yes, just turn left there. Okay. Let me get him. I got him. There you go. Thanks Alicia... I mean, Jo.

You have different partners for different dances. Some like to waltz, and some like to do the tango, and some like to foxtrot. (laughing) Let me guess... Duncan tangos? Yeah. And the dance of narcissism. And Larry, he does rock and roll? Yeah that's just like... "Cut to the chase, let's get it on." (both laughing) Well, that leaves... Waltzing Mayhew.

(women chuckling) What's...? Nothing. (both laughing) Thanks. (Daniel) ...it has been said in the face of this awful mystery that God is the answer for which there is no question. And while that paradox may embody the very heart of Christian faith, it is a bleak response to souls suffering, and souls grieving. (officer) We got a forced entry over here. (Daniel) It would be presumptuous of me, and futile, to explain such a vast puzzle. (indistinct chatter, helicopter hovering) (officer) Looks like a random killing, Captain. Indeed, our capacity to love while suffering is perhaps more important than at any other time in our lives. It's good to see you again, Helen. Yes, thank you. Thank you. See you at home. Bye. Good sermon. Thank you, darling. Tom. Thank you. Eli! Hi. Hey. I didn't... I didn't, uh... Uh, Sylvia, this is... this is Joanne, uh... Beckett. Beckett. Oh, hi! Eli told me about running across you. Small world, huh? Well, to me it feels pretty large right now. We haven't seen each other in what, over 25 years? Well, small Adams Mills. So, how long have you lived here? Oh, a long time. My husband has been the minister here for 15 years. Your husband is Reverend Beckett? That's right. Wow. We're here because we heard he was the star of the township. He's very handsome up there on the pulpit. And very impressive. Well, I think Daniel's found his calling. How about you Eli, are you still a chemist? You were always so good at that. Eli's in medical research. Yes, well I guess I found my calling too: to end human suffering through pharmaceuticals. Not quite as comprehensive as your husband's solution. Well, I'm sure there are different kinds of suffering. So, did Eli tell you I neglected Arthur? No, not at all. Well, I did. I didn't notice he hadn't moved. You know, I don't think noticing sooner would've made much difference. You know what? You guys should come to our house for dinner. Well, you should come have dinner with us. Eli's a fabulous cook. Still? Yeah. Still. So you and the reverend must come. I'd love to meet him up close and personal. All right, then we'll do that. Great! It's a date. I'll call you. You'll have to tell me all about him when he was young. Okay. See you later. Bye. Cassie? Hi. Mrs. Beckett. I'm your daughter's guitar player. Oh, so nice to meet you. Hi.

We laid it down. The whole set. And when we finished, we all took a bow. (laughter) That's right, we did! And then, we did an encore. (laughter) Hey Cass, do you still sing that Britney song? What was it called? Um... "Baby, Baby Give Me Another Chance," what is it? Mom, please. Oh, come on, honey. You sing that so pretty. (Malky) Cass could sing "The Lord's Prayer" in Braille.

You're famous with me already, honey. Thanks, Daddy. (imitates gagging) Blah! (band members groaning) Hey, hey, I'm allowed. Boomer likes it. Boomer likes the love. Daddy does too. You don't really think she's sleeping with, uh... With the Black Sheep? No, I don't. But I think they're all in love with her. Hey, who can blame them? I just see her searching, looking for a path. I see myself in her so clearly it makes me want to wave and go "Hey! Remember me when I was your age?" You mean when you ran off to your commune? (chuckles) It was a co-operative. Oh. Oh, by the way, I saw Eli Mayhew in church today. Yeah, I thought I saw two new faces. His wife's pretty glamorous. She's a looker. Was that his type back then in the, uh, co-operative?

It's that we haven't devised an efficient delivery system to get the medicines past the blood-brain barrier. And this is the field you specialize in? Yep, that's me. Delivery man. (Sylvia) I mean, they think that death is such a high, these guys. (Joanne) Oh, dear. I picked up this piece in the artisans' village in Manzanillo, Mexico. It's interesting. Oh, is this Arthur? Oh, yeah, when he was younger, I guess. I certainly never saw him jump like that. Really? Well... how long have you and Eli been married? About a year. Little longer I guess. (chuckling) Yeah. When I first came along, the dog was on his last legs. But, Eli refused to accept it. He used to talk to him at night. I mean, really talk to him. To tell you the truth, I thought he was a little weird. Oh? I've never thought of Eli as weird. Yeah, well, when I first met him, he was. Living on his own, talking to his dog, working all those long hours. You know, at first I thought he was gay. But he wasn't. That works out better for you. Yeah. (laughing) (Eli) Come and get it! Shall we? Sure. (laughter) (Daniel) Well, I'm stuffed. I've never had better shrimp. Well, it helps that they were recently alive. Mmm, that's right. That's the secret: fresh out of the water. Yes, you're right. Thank you. You're welcome. You're a fine cook. Thank you. (Joanne) He always was. (chuckles) You were, you were. We used to take turns cooking every night, and yet the only night anyone would show up was the night Eli cooked. Only because I couldn't convince them that cooking was a matter of literacy. If you can read a cookbook, you can cook. Very erudite of you. Yeah, yeah. But then you were dealing with Larry, whose specialty was tuna casserole. Ugh! Ugh, yeah, that was... Nasty. That was nasty. And mine was meatloaf. I hate meatloaf. (laughter) And then Duncan was good at... Duncan, Duncan... Duncan. Duncan, Mr. Pizza Man. Yeah. He was a master at ordering. Well done, that is. And then Dana... Dana. Dana was into leftovers. She was a reheater. A reheater. Wow, it's amazing that the two of you should meet up again. Have you ever run into any of the others? No. No, no. Um, to tell you the truth, Alicia's the only one I would've wanted to run into again. I used to call myself Alicia, then. You know. Don't ask. (Sylvia) So... Alicia? (Eli) Alicia. So, what? Were you two an item? No. (Joanne) Oh, God no. Oh, I'm sorry, honey. Don't say it like that. Thanks a lot. I didn't mean "God, no, ick." I... "No," I just meant "no." Thank you, I appreciate it. Right, okay I remember now. It was, um, it was the other one, Donna? Don... Dana. Dana! Dana. The femme fatale. Well, changing the subject... Your research, Eli, it's primarily concerned with getting the body to accept the cures that you have developed. Yeah, that's right, the blood-brain barrier. (chuckles) It's the new frontier. Eli is going where no man has gone before. (Daniel) Mm. (Daniel) You know, I sometimes wonder, if in our pursuit of longer lives, that we're not projecting the idea of transcending mortality itself. You afraid that's gonna cut into your market? Well, I wouldn't quite put it that way, but... You know, I've always wanted to know this: Why is it that every major religion forbids suicide? Now what, are they afraid that if it's okay to off yourself, that a lot of people living disease-ridden, miserable lives will opt for heaven direct and miss out on the painful part? Oh, I can't believe that if, uh, the injunction against suicide was removed that a great many of us would take the plunge. The survival instinct is pretty core... Oh, don't be so sure. I mean, especially if you could get someone like Jo here to deliver the sympathetic needle. (awkward chuckles) (Sylvia) Eli... That's awful. What? It's true. What? No, no, no. Jo has a similar opinion. But the bottom line is, our lives are not ours to end. God gave us life. And we have a responsibility to Him to honor that gift. But what if in the end, it is just suddenly dark? Oh, thee of little faith. (Eli chuckling) Oh, you have no doubts on that score? I have some uncertainties, but no doubts. And the difference between uncertainty and doubt? Uncertainties have to do with comprehension. Doubt has to do with faith. I'm just as confused as the next guy as to what the Kingdom of Heaven consists of, but I have no doubt that it will be revealed to me. That's what I want to hear from my minister. There you go, Daniel. Another worshipper. Well my cup runneth over. (distant dog barking) (owl hooting) You didn't tell me you used another name back then. Alicia's dead. Changed my life, changed my name. I told you when I left my first husband that I dropped out of sight. Ah, yes, the first husband. I always forget I'm number two. (chuckles) Always number one in my heart. How's that? (chuckles) (distant dogs barking) (Joanne) All right, the retriever is good for another 50,000 miles. Well I'll alert all the ducks in the area. You should be home. Come on, leave. Are you sure? Yes, I can take it from here. You know, you have a home, too. I know, but Daniel's with the Hallorans. Oh, that poor woman wasting away like that. It's draining. Yeah, hard on everyone. Those were fine words the reverend spoke on Sunday. Went right to my heart. Daniel's a great speaker. He is much more than that. He's a man of God, more than any man that I've ever known, and believe me, I have known plenty. I believe you. (chuckles) (telephone ringing) I'll get that. You go. Don't even think about getting it. Vet clinic. (Eli) Uh, Jo? It's, uh, it's me. Eli? Oh, I was just leaving. Um, okay. Do you... do you have a couple of minutes? Yeah, sure. What is it? Well, if you were just leaving, I'm outside in your lot. I'm at the far end, by the tree. Um, okay. Well, it's gonna take me a few minutes. Can you wait? Yeah. Yeah, sure. I can wait. Okay, good. Bye. Hi. Hey. Nice car. Better be for the price. Look, I just wanted to say I hope I wasn't... offensive last night. Offensive? No, you weren't offensive. Or confrontational. I know Sylvia thought maybe I went too far. No, no, no. Daniel likes to spar with the best of them. I got the impression he was... a little surprised by you being called Alicia. Oh, yeah, I sort of, um, forgot to mention that. Who does... (chuckles) Yeah. Why did you change your name? Because I married my high school sweetheart when I was 19. I don't know, one day I had this, sort of... I don't... I don't know what you call it, anyway... Saw my life, sort of like this forward road straight out in front, going on, and on, and on, and I could see what he would become and what I would be and what our children, all 2.5 of them, would be and I don't know, I just got scared and I ran. You had a premonition. Yeah. You know, I wouldn't have thought that you were the kind of guy who believed in premonitions. I mean, the scientist that you are. I'm a scientist by day. But at night... Yeah, by night? Look, um... could we meet sometime? I mean some other time when we could talk? Yeah, sure. Um, I have to be in Boston all this week. I could do Boston. Okay.

I think this was supposed to happen. Yeah. And even if it wasn't, it did. Listen, Alicia... I like Alicia. That's who I was around you and Dana. You know, I haven't been able to talk to anybody about Dana or those times. Dana once said that I should tell you. Tell me what? That I was attracted to you. Yeah, she told me the same thing. Now, of course I didn't because I... didn't know if you, you know, felt that way about me, but you were always so wonderful to talk to, that... Oh, I was so crazy about her. About Dana. Crazy about her? You know, I couldn't understand why she would say something like that to me when she knew how I felt. I mean, I knew she'd had relationships with Duncan and Larry at some point. Even... I thought maybe she had something going on with you. (scoffs) Nothing like that. I mean, I loved her, but... But it didn't matter. I couldn't see past how I felt. Have you ever had that? Where somebody else just becomes your whole world? Everything? I think it's the one thing I missed. Or avoided. You don't even see the world through your own eyes, but through theirs. I had no idea that you were that obsessed with Dana. Well, Dana warned me, said I couldn't go around brooding. Alicia, she was... (clock chiming) She was my first. For everything. For sex. For love. She gave me that, you know, she gave both of those. Together. She was incredible. I mean, I know I didn't have much to compare it to then, but... Losing that was like being... kicked out of Eden. Hmm. I didn't know scientists believed in Eden. Oh, I believed in a lot of things before I killed Dana. ♪♪ What is that, a bad joke? It wasn't funny Eli. Why would you say something like that?

That was that night. That night, the ninth of September! It was a Tuesday. God! Okay, fine, I had been at the lab all day. I came back so we could be alone. I thought when she saw, you know, that six months hadn't made any difference... But Dana had forgotten all about it. I had to wake her up. What's this all about, Eli? This is the day. What day? The day we talked about. (Eli) You promised, and nothing has changed for me. Well, things have kind of changed for me. Are you hungry? I've waited six months for you. She just put her hand on my face. Poor, sweet Eli. And then, sympathetic... You are so sweet and faithful. The way she had with things, dogs, cats, people. You know. Do you wanna go upstairs, and we can be sweet to one another? Poor Eli. You deserve a medal for fidelity. "You wanna come upstairs? Be sweet with one another?" It's like you said about being outside yourself. I could see me... (screaming) No! No! Aah! (screaming) Hitting her. (screaming) Again and again, and I had a knife in my hand. I mean, I don't even know where I got it. I guess off the counter. And I was... No! No! (screaming) No! (grunting) Why are you telling me this crazy story? Because you're the only person I can tell. Listen, I've... I've thought about this terrible, terrible thing I did every day of my life. Every single day. Then why didn't you tell the police when... Because I didn't mean to kill her. I told you that. I thought you'd understand. No, no, no. Come on, wait a second. No, just stop it! Why would you think I would understand? You had no right to tell me something like this. You hear me, no right. Not something like this. ♪♪ (valet) Thank you, ma'am. (distant dog barking) Hey, you got your hair cut. Oh, God! Daniel. What? What, honey? Oh, God. What? Oh, God, Daniel. What, honey? Jo. Tell me. Please, tell me. Oh God, Daniel. I made a terrible mistake. I went to see Eli Mayhew in Boston and he told me that... What did he tell you? That he killed Dana. Your friend, Dana? Why did you go see him in Boston? Just to have lunch. You know, talk about old times. But I thought you said you were going in to shop? Nothing happened. I didn't say it did. But you should know I didn't do anything wrong. Except go into Boston to see Eli Mayhew. For what reason, Jo? For the reason of being... unfaithful in your marriage? Am I wrong, Jo? But nothing happened. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I kissed him. Just once. I just got caught up in the moment. I'm so sorry, but that's all that happened, I promise you. Because he confessed to a murder before you could commit adultery? Oh my God, Daniel. You make that seem like that was beside the point. Well, my wife just tried to sleep with another man. Forgive me if I have trouble staying on point. God, Daniel, you know what? Sometimes you can be such a self-righteous ass! I may be, Jo. I get that way when my wife decides something on the side is worth throwing away our marriage. Don't you walk away from me! Think of me as one of your damn flock, Reverend Beckett! Tell me what I should do! Under the circumstances, I don't think I can. Consult your own conscience. I'd say it could use the exercise. Daniel, I'm sorry! I'm sorry. (crying) (birds chirping) I need your help. No, I think this is something you need to help yourself with. This was your doing, not mine. What, about a crime he committed? A crime that he confessed to committing? Why would he do that? Because he loved her and she rejected him. No, no. Why would he admit it to you? After all these years? I don't know. I don't know. Maybe he thought that I would understand. Maybe he thought I was the only person who could understand. Maybe he had been tormented all those years and he just wanted to get it out. I don't know. Tell me, was this, uh, intended affair mutual? What does that mean? Eli Mayhew invited you to Boston to some motel, I assume. The Ambassador. Oh, upmarket adultery. Did he invite you there with the intention of having sex? Or was it you who had that intention? I've told you... Oh, I know, I know. "Nothing happened." And what if Mr. Mayhew's confession was a way of extricating himself from a very embarrassing situation? (sighs) That's crazy. Not any crazier than a man telling someone he hardly knows he's committed murder. What did he think you would do once he told? I don't know. I don't know Daniel. I don't know what he thinks, or what he thought. I know that what I did was wrong, and I can't change it. I did want to sleep with him, and let myself believe he wanted to sleep with me. And he wanted to confess, and I guess he convinced himself that I wanted to hear it. Too bad. You were both delusional. Daniel...

Could've told you that. Could've saved you the drive. I need to talk to you. Do you have just a few minutes? Yeah. Hey, Cass. Ten minutes tops. Gotta keep the vibe going. She's great, huh? Oh, yeah, she's great. Well, what's going on? I know something's wrong. Mm. Yeah, something's wrong. You and Dad breaking up? We're just having some problems. I'm... I'm having problems. So? Come on, out with it. I mean, what could be so bad that you're on the outs with Reverend Beckett? I almost had an affair and your father found out. You almost had an affair? What kind of crisis is that? Oh, God Cassie, you try so hard not to give a damn. Yeah, well I'm just not used to being your confidante. Yeah, well, I wouldn't be here if you weren't the only one I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let's just... let's not go there. Why don't you just tell me what happened? This man came into my clinic a couple of weeks back. He had been my roommate in a co-op in Cambridge like a million years ago. Anyway, one of the other roommates, her name was Dana, got murdered in that house. Right. I remember you telling me about that once. And this guy, his name was Eli Mayhew, he was her lover. What'd he do, kill her? Yeah. Oh, my God! I just said that. I... How do you know? He told me. He told me when I went to his hotel room to be unfaithful to your father. This is just all so weird! Yes, it is... weird. Anyway, I ran out of there and I went home and I immediately told your father what I had done. It seems that the thing that upset him most is that his wife almost cheated on him. Poor Dad. Poor Mom. And Eli? I mean... Eli? What... Well, think about it. 30 years is a long time to want to confess. I mean, he must've really thought that you weren't gonna turn him in. I haven't. You haven't? Why not? Because he'll deny it. He will. He'll deny it. And your dad thinks that he made up the whole story anyway just so he could get rid of me. Dad said that? Yeah. Well, Dad's nuts, because that's exactly what you have to do, Mom. Why? Because if you don't, then it sucks from every direction. I mean, Daddy gets betrayed, you get humiliated, and Eli gets away with murder. Oh, my God, it's such a small town. Everyone will know about it. So you go to the cops in Cambridge. I mean, that's where it happened, right? Yeah. Well, then, they'll listen. It's not like you're some weirdo. I mean, hell, you're the... you're the preacher's wife. (knocking on door) Cassie, it's showtime. Yeah, in a minute! Come on, we gotta rock. And don't call me Cassie! Only my mother gets to call me Cassie. Sorry. And not often. ♪♪ And Mr. Mayhew volunteered this information to you? Without any prompting? Completely, and I never would have suspected him. Well, what about at the time of the murder? Oh, not for a second. We were all great friends. You never wondered, ever? I mean, the crime being unsolved. Well, I believed what the police believed. You know, that somebody had come in, and... Off the street for drugs or something, and then they murdered her. Mm-hmm. But now you're convinced it was Mr. Mayhew? Well, I'm convinced because he confessed to me that he did it, and he told me why he did it. So, you go by his hotel to schmooze about old times, and he just up and says "By the way, I killed Dana Jablonski"? Yes. You have to wonder why he would say a thing like that. Did he think his secret was safe with you? I would have to assume that he did. Did he say "What I'm gonna tell you, you have to promise not to..." No, no, no. He didn't say anything like that. He... In fact, when he told me, I thought he was kidding and I commented that that wasn't funny. Sure. He didn't threaten you afterwards or ask you not to say anything? No, he didn't. So this visit to Mr. Mayhew's hotel room, it took place, what, three, four days ago? Friday. Friday. Three days ago. Friday. Did your husband know you were going to see Mr. Mayhew at his hotel? I mean, before the fact. Before you actually went. Of course he did. All right. Well, thanks for coming in. ♪♪ (door closes) You've been to see Cass? How'd you know? She called, to see how you were. She told me she advised you to go to the police. I took her advice. You've been already? You don't think you should've talked to me first? Why? Would you have advised against it? No, but I would've liked to have known. And I certainly would have liked to have known you were going to talk to Cass before you went. Why? Would you have advised against that too? I don't think she deserved to hear such a story from her mother. Frankly, I didn't think your relationship was up to those kinds of revelations. Oh, right. Unlike yours. Well, there you go. Just shows you how desperate I was. But you know what? It was the first time I felt as close to Cass as she's always been to you. Does that bother you, Daniel? Daniel, I have apologized. I know what I did was wrong, and it was hurtful, and it caused you pain... Yes! Yes, it was, Jo. And why? That's what I can't answer. What was wrong between us that caused such betrayal? You know what, sometimes it isn't about "us," or "we." Sometimes it's actually about "me." Me. I'm a separate person. And that day in the rowboat when I had that premonition... Oh, come on, you're just trying to justify... I am not trying to justify anything! If you could just stop judging me just long enough so you could hear what I have to say before you make up your mind. Daniel... When I had that premonition or daydream or whatever you call it, it was real. It happened. The next day, Eli Mayhew walks into my office with his dog. He loved that dog and I do know about things like that. He loved that dog and he had to kill it, and that touched something in me. And along with all those good feelings that I had from the past, there was a connection to the rowboat. Can you not see there was a connection? You know what? You're always saying that God works in mysterious ways. Maybe this was God's way of bringing this murder to light. You don't believe in God, Jo. Well maybe with a little luck, he'll believe in me! God, it's just... Hi. Hi. Listen, I wanted to ask your advice about something. Sure. Eli's been really, I don't know, down. I mean, he has his moods, but... well, this is more like depression. And I thought, maybe he's brooding over Arthur. Oh, Arthur. Yes. Yeah, and I wondered about getting him a puppy. You know, Arthur the Second, and... and I wanted to ask you what you thought about that. I mean, do I get him a look-alike? What kind of dog was Arthur again? A Smooth Fox Terrier. Oh, right. Yeah, I knew it was a dumb name. Or do I go the other way? Do I get a Rottweiler? Or maybe a Great Dane? These things are pretty hard to know. Yeah, but do you think it's a good idea? I mean, another dog. Yeah, yeah. I think it is a good idea. Maybe it isn't Arthur, though, you know, that he's worried about. What else could it be? I mean, he's successful, he loves his job. He lives in a nice house in a beautiful town. He's married to me and he has his health. Yeah, you're right. He has a lot going for him. You're right. Well, maybe you should talk to him. Me? Yeah. He likes you. He told me he did, the night you came over for dinner with the reverend. He said he was really glad he ran into you again. You know, if you were ten years younger, I might be jealous. Oh. There's no need to ever be jealous of me. Yeah, well I know. But I think maybe you should talk to him. You know, I don't want to be rude, but could you excuse me, because I need to get ready for work and I think I'm running late. Sure. No problem. Um, listen, thanks for the advice. Okay. Okay. Bye. (car engine starting) (knocking on door) Reverend Beckett? Mm-hmm. I'm Detective Geary. This is Sergeant Eberhart. We've come to talk to Mrs. Beckett. Come in. Can I get you anything? Coffee or soda? We're fine, thank you. I'll be in my den, if I can be of any help. Sure. Please, have a seat. (distant dog barking) We've spoken to Mr. Mayhew about your allegation. You mean about his confession? Mr. Mayhew denies having made any such confession. Well, then, he's lying to you. You see Mrs. Beckett, what you say Mr. Mayhew told you doesn't fill in any of the blanks. We knew he was doing a number with the victim. It seems like you all were. But his alibi was checked back then and it held up. There was no murder weapon found and the feeling was at the time that some drug addict came in off the street looking to steal something. Your friend surprised him and got killed. Now nothing you've told us casts any particular doubt on that story. But if he didn't admit it, why would I make that up? You tell us. Do you think I'm the kind of person who would make up something like that? We don't know what kind of person you are, Mrs. Beckett. She would never make up a story like that. That's not my wife. You sound pretty sure about that, Reverend. I am. It's all right, Daniel. If they don't believe me... Mr. Mayhew says that your wife was pursuing him. He thinks she made all this up because he wouldn't play along. Then he's a liar. As well as a murderer. Is that because she wasn't chasing him, or because he's denying what she said? Both. You'd be willing to make a statement to that effect? Yes. Stop it. I was at Mr. Mayhew's hotel because I was attracted... interested, whatever the hell you want to call it, in him. He mistook that for something else. Sympathy, maybe. I don't know. He was not focused on me. He was intent on confessing something that had been on his conscience for all those years. My husband did not know I went to see him. He found out about that afterwards at home when I told him about it. And that's when he learned that I had... intended to betray him. Us. I lied to you, Detective, when I said Daniel knew otherwise, but I am not lying to you now about what Eli Mayhew said to me in that hotel room. That how it was, Reverend Beckett? Absolutely. That's how I know she's been telling the truth. Because she's being more than honest about her reasons for going to that hotel. All right, Mrs. Beckett. You're gonna have to make a statement. We'll set it up at the prosecutor's office. It will be under oath, you understand? I do. You don't remember me, do you? I was on that case, just a patrolman then. You folks were asking for trouble. Didn't even lock your doors, as I recall. Actually, I do remember you. As I recall, you thought Dana had it coming to her. I wouldn't go that far. But you all lived a very risky lifestyle back then. You remember? I remember a girl who was full of life, and had that brutally taken from her. That's what I remember. (Geary) We'll be in touch about the statement. Thank you. Thank you, Reverend. ♪♪ I'm sorry, Daniel. (car engine starting) I am so very sorry. Don't be sorry for telling the truth, Jo. I had to tell you. I couldn't not have told you. Maybe he couldn't not tell you. He's gonna get away with it, isn't he? You've done all you can do, Jo. Have I? ♪♪ (birds chirping) (doorbell rings) Alicia? You know, Sylvia and I were just about to go for a jog. You saved me. Uh, come on in. Please. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have involved you. That is the least of it. I know. I know what I did was a terrible, terrible thing. And it was a long time ago. And I've tried to live a life that counts. Eli, you loved her. Of course I did. You loved her. Of course I did, but I... And I loved her. I... You need to do this, for her. I can't... I can't... I can't undo the past. But you can take responsibility for it right now. I do. I do. I do.

Do you want to spend the rest of your life in hell? Just tell them, Eli. No, I won't. I won't do it. I don't deserve that. You don't deserve it? And by the way, by the way, look around you. Hell's pretty well decorated, wouldn't you say? Oh... (Sylvia) What is this? (dog whimpering) Nothing, sweetheart. I wouldn't say that. Not at all. What the hell is going on here? Eli, is there something going on between you two? There was. What does that mean? What does that mean? I don't know. What is she talking about? I don't know. Don't walk away! I don't know what she's talking about. What's this about "tell them"? I don't know! Amy Halloran was a wonderful mother, wife, and friend who died too young. And we are left to ponder why. Why are the good among us taken before their time? Whatever the circumstance, we are left with an abiding sense of injustice, of anger. How can this have happened, this tragedy, for so many? And God has no ready answer for us, but he does have a profound sense of compassion, and a path to light. If we grasp all that was good and noble about Amy, and we hold onto that, and open our hearts to God's love, it is there. A peace that will conquer rage, hope that will eclipse the emptiness. And most of all, to wash our wounded soul, the tender mercy of forgiveness. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪
