THE BURGLAR Goddamn Split! How long have I been in the business, Bonk? For years I've been pinching stones from old richies. For years. No fooling around. I pick out an old buzzard... and... Jack-pot! Eighty thousand a year, tax-free. How much? This time? Nothing! Goddammit, not a sparkle! The one time I don't check the tip. But it was dead on! They're holidaying in Majorca. We'll soon be unemployed. Hey Glimmy! What's up? There's a gent looking for you, right in the open. What sort of gent? Real classy. Look, there he goes. What did he say? Where is Mister Burg? Who calls me MISTER Burg? Mister Burg? That's a laugh! O.K. Bonk, we're gonna have a word with ol' brass-balls. An orange juice please. Could you tell me where I might find Mister Burg? Here! Mister Burg? That table there. Patty, the usual. A beer for me. It's strictly private. Bonk stays. My name is Van Borsen. President Director Financial Union. Not bad! I obtained your name from my lawyer. My step-daughter, Fanny, has disappeared. I am her guardian. I want you to find her. Why me? The police... I have great respect for the police, but... well, she is a difficult girl... ...she's caused me a great deal of trouble... ...and I don't want my reputation jeopardised. My lawyer, Mr. Van Sprangen mentioned your name... He once stood up for me in a little tiff with the law. This is her. Nope, never seen her before. Fanny is addicted to drugs... ...so you might, through a dealer... That's what YOU thought. In this box you'll find three thousand guilders... ...your fee and expenses. That's no chicken-shit. Not bad for a little week-day. I'll do it. And when I find her? Just let me know. I'll do the rest. What rest? I can always resort to the police of course. Good evening. Three thousand bingo! ...just like that. Bonk, this stinks like hell. I don't smell nothing. That guy's screwy A beer Patty! Coming up Holly. May I? Nope! Glimmy, don't pull those tricks on me. Mind your own business, Cop! Be good now! Listen Glimmy, you know I like you... Bonk, play a sweet tune on the juke-box. What're you up to? Can't I have a talk without the police nosing around? That Van Borsen is big game. It could cost you your head. Hee-haw yer mother-in-law. I'm not bluffing. It's too dangerous for that. What does he want from you? Tell him. O.K. If it's life or death... He wanted me to take him to some fancy joints. Yeah, I'll bet... I warned you... Thanks for the beer. Why should that girl cost y' yer head? I dunno. But we'd better keep an eye open. Hallo, Minnie. That swanky dude ain't worth a penny. He thinks we're some crooks... who're gonna spend the dough and never go after that bird. But we're gonna find that Fanny... ...and keep our hands right off the money. Here it says: "The capitalistic class undermines itself." Is that so? Glimmy is a burglar and that's it. A professional! So he's no blackmailer. He was suspected of a series of robberies and convicted only once! A wily bastard. He scares off everyone with his knife... ...but he'll never bump off anyone. How does he fit into Van Borsen's scheme? If you could only tell me something about Van Borsen? Sorry, Van Holl, I can't. How can I work on a case without any facts? Van Borsen is my case, Glimmy is yours. Report all his moves. Good luck! Ever seen her around? Who is she? My girlfriend. Looks real classy. Rich daddy! Lucky guy. Stocking up for the weekend? No, just for tonight. Ever seen this chick? Hash. Go rub it in your hair. Don't be so nervous. Glimmy, am I your buddy or not? I'm gonna nail that cap to the wall. Then use me instead of grandpa. Outta the way! You're drunk. Who's drunk here! Scram! Ready Uncle Willy? Nobody in the world can beat that. Patty, free drinks for everybody. ...Goddamm... Something happened. What? You ain't been outta my sight! Later! Troubles again? No, the police is my best friend. Are you the lawyer of a certain Van Borsen? No! You know him? I met him at parties. Did you perhaps drop my name? I mentioned you once in connection with your knife. Was Van Borsen there? I don't remember. How much do I owe you? Aw, forget it... Show me your knife collection. Come this way. I feel uneasy. Me too. I thought it over. If Fanny's around here, we'd have met her by now. Tired? What do you mean? Well, all the brainwork... We'll tackle the Leidseplein. Police? Private Detective. Bureau "Eye and Ear!" Now, is that dame ever in demand! Another detective asked about her yesterday. Looking for Fanny? Forget it! Drugs and boozing like hell... Always pissed and stoned. We were fed up with her. She's a bit strange, just like the rest here. She was a sweet kid. When did you see her last? Some weeks ago. She must've run away. Run away? From an old man. You know him? No, but she had blue marks on her neck. Have a drink. We're nowhere if we don't find Fanny soon. Van Borsen must have tried to kill her. Then he hired a detective to find her. He didn't expect us to go after her. When he finds her, he'll try again... ...and we'll get the axe for that murder. Are you serious? What's this all about? You're gonna be sorry for this. What´s your connection with Van Borsen? Now listen real good to me... ...I am not going to tell you anything. Two thousand? It's not a question of money. Why so rough Bonk? Some day you're gonna clobber some guy stone dead. He's still breathing. Nice bump. Get'm outside and put the gun in his hand. Inspector van Holl, please. Ah Holly, got a minute? There's a drunk lying on the street. A disgrace for the neighbourhood. He had a gun in his hand... funny eh? Naw, too dangerous for me. You're welcome. So long! We'll never find her. We've got to. She's terrified of her step daddy. Good morning Holly... ...Now? ...I'm not dressed yet. Jesus Christ, Fanny! Holly wants to show me something in the hospital. One thing. We don't know Fanny! Here's your "drunken bum". He still held the gun. What did he want? What're you talking about? Come on, or I'll arrest you. With what proof? That's not my style. I am no murderer. I can make it bloody messy for you. What did he want to know? What I talked about with Van Borsen What'd you tell him? That Van Borsen wanted a tour around the red-light district. I'm careful with a gun aimed at me. We didn't know if this was the guy you phoned us about. You want a lift? I'd rather walk... Can I have my knife? He has nothing to do with the murder. We identified the body. It is... ...Von Hellberg. Who told you? German Embassy. He asked them to warn us in case something happened. He was after Van Borsen... ...and some big economical swindle. The types involved have a shady past and these are their methods. We got ourselves in a mess. They really butchered that German. What we're doing is playing dumb. Showing that photo around. It's just what Van Borsen wants. He'll tell the police I'm playing around with his daughter... and that he gave me money to break up with her. So what? Soon they'll find her with my knife in her body. It was pinched, when we were drunk. Who could've pinched it? I dunno. And when? I dunno Where then? I dunno!! You don't know nothing. Someone's gonna pay for this. What're you gonna do? Find that chick. And when you find her? Then I take her to my mother's. Good afternoon. I said good afternoon! I can hear you, it is been two months! For two months not peep from him. You'd think he might ring his mother... ...but no, to him I'm as good as dead. Then suddenly, there he is... ...if it suits the gentleman. I won't be treated like that! Why don't you drop dead? Finished? No mother can take that. You only come to me when you're in trouble. When you're riding high, nothing! I'm not just anybody! Where can I go if I really need help? To me. My baby. Sure you come to mamma. They just went in. We'll wait What a joint! Take small sips Bonk, it's an expensive place. What a clip joint. If we find Fanny, it's worth it. Ask Miss Hispanita to have a drink with us. Have a seat. Miss Van Borsen. How d'you know my name? We're private detectives. My stepfather sent you here. Would you like a drink? A gin and tonic, please. A gin and tonic, vodka and a beer! Is this a party? Not exactly, but we're glad you're here. This is my mother. She'll show you to your room. You think I'm gonna work here? Too crazy! Come on, you'd better do what we say. Shouldn't we ask her some questions? No, we'll let her cool off a bit. No drink, no hash. Come on duckie. Your father wants to kill you. Why should he? Because you know something about him. What? He wants you murdered and me in jail for it. Your kidding. And I don't buy that. I know you're scared stiff. He tried to strangle you. That's why I gotta stay here? Yeah, if you want to stay alive. You don't wanna go back to daddy. Why not? Because I love you! How's life without... She won't squeal on that step-father. I can't stand this any longer. This ain't no hotel. Shall I take her food upstairs? Remember, food only. Then she'll soften up. Look here... ...the best grass I could find... ...that's a surprise eh? Groovy! What's wrong? I can't stay here for ever. Can I trust you? Sure! I was thirteen when my mother died. After that I lived with my step-father. A year later he raped me. Then I took revenge. I played his dirty games with others... and told him everything... in details. The more I got his goat... ...the better I liked it. One day he hit back, literally. He gave me a black eye. In spite of everything I stayed with him. Then he started to write me filthy threatening letters. He's up to something, there's an European crime syndicate. When I asked him about it... ...he went white as a sheet. Then in a back alley, he tried to strangle me. It is tunny Bonk, but I'm not afraid of dying... ...but I'm afraid of him... Why not tell Glimmy? Don't say a word to him, please. Why not? He's no match for my father. You're sweet... You want to go to bed with me? Goddammit all, Bonk. Where is she? I don't know. She's killed with my knife. Get a screw-driver! Lie down on the sofa. Pretend you´re sick. I am finished anyway. Come right away. Mother had an attack. What´re you doing. Nothing. Lie down. I called the doctor in a phone booth. Where´ve you been? What's it to you? Fanny is dead. That's not my concern. She was staying here. Where've you been? Mother's sick. I just phoned the doctor from a phone booth. Your knife! You think that I..?! Knife! Fanny is dead. Murdered. He's dying in front of my eyes! Murderer! Call the doctor! I thought the phone went dead, didn't it? He did that himself! He's going to die! It's rather late, isn't it. Fanny was murdered, probably by a Willem Burg. That doesn't surprise me. She knew that criminal. Next! Yes doctor, where can I undress? Name? Leni Schepers. Born? 20 November 1940. Occupation? Come off it, Holly! Occupation? Social worker. Tell me, do you know this girl? Sure, she stayed in the attic. Glimmy's girl. But Bonk had a bit of fun with her too. Went up to her twice a day! Bonk playing around with Glimmy's girl? How'd you know? These babes aren't blind. Both, Bonk and Glimmy, sleep with her. One by one of course. Glimmy gets jealous, and he kills her. The Bonk knocks Glimmy with one blow into hospital. And all for that little slut! Short of money again? Off you go ducky... ...and put on the beans straight away. What a pity, those two buddies. You're telling me. We've been neighbours... for years. Keep your powder dry, girls. Now, tell me the truth. How's Glimmy? Still unconscious. How did you know that Fanny danced in that club? We didn't! Pure coincidence. Why were you looking for her? I can... but on the other hand, I can't tell you. Bullshit! What can you tell me? Well, it's like this... It's all so strange... Was it premeditated murder perhaps? No. I should keep my trap shut! Why were you looking for her? I dunno... Why did you hit Glimmy? I dunno... Starting that I-dunno business again? Why did you hit him? I dunno! I had to hit someone. Glimmy or you... anyone. Like that. Just, like that. You were jealous? There was nothing between them. Why was she living there? Because... I won't say another word. Lock me up. You can go. Are you still at Glimmy's place? I can't go there. Arrest me. How many knives has Glimmy? One. Thanks. And the knife? We only found three thousand guilders at his mother's, so... ...he must have had two knives. And the motive? Jealousy. They both loved Fanny. "Crime passionel". Probably. Bonk and Glimmy's mother didn't tell me anything. I'm curious about Glimmy's story. Van Borsen plays a key-role in a fascist organisation. We know the big "economy-boys" whom he visits regularly... ...but we don't have evidence. This murder is most inconvenient for Van Borsen. So, you dirty murderer. Where've you been? Fine buddy you are. First knocks my son down, then forgets me! Brandy? I saw the lawyer. He'll do the best he can. I'll visit Glimmy tomorrow. Tell him I'm sorry. Lot of God that'll do! It'll never be the same. Stop fretting. What's done is done. What're you doing? I went through a lot... but this... The old girl is in love! You'll have to face it. Who goes first? Well, Sherlock Holmes, did he confess? He said you did it. Don't close the door. I'm his mother. I'm sorry. Poppycock. What a sight! No kiss? Aw, my baby... Take this; it says what you and Bonk must do at the trail. Very kind, that they let me visit you. Bonk is so sorry, he wanted to give you something. He feels very guilty. Best wishes from the girls. I got some news for you. Remember my niece? She stayed with me... Fanny.. She had an affair with her uncle. He wrote her some weird letters, which she saved for later! A friend of mine told me. You know him, that big fellow, a real fighter. I'll be damned! He's gone crazy from that blow. If I were Glimmy... But you're the Bonk and that's good enough for me. And we do exactly what he has written. Being reminded of this event must be very painful. But please, answer the court, as carefully as possible. You said there was a relationship... ...between Willem Burg and the victim. I knew, because Fanny told me about her escapades... ...in order to humiliate me. I worried a great deal about her. I felt sorry for her. I went so see the rascal. He admitted his relationship... ...and described her erotic talents. He even showed me a picture of her. I gave him three thousand guilders to finish the affair... ...but he kept the picture. What happened after that? He abducted her. She was held against her will. I know how it happened. She provoked him and he stabbed her to death. Mister Councillor? You accuse my client of murdering your step-daughter... ...because they had an affair? Have you ever asked Fanny about this? She kept me informed without my asking. So your daughter... Don't you think that enough has been said... ...about her immoral behaviour? No more questions. Where you on intimate terms with Miss Van Borsen? Yes, Your Honour. He's confessing! You met Mr. Van Borsen on July 15. That's right. What did you talk about? Well it started just as he said now. He said that I had an affair with his step-daughter... ...and he wanted to buy me off. But our affair had already come to an end... ...she had given me a photo with inscription... "Thanks for everything". So when he offered me money... ...I knew that Fanny had pulled a trick... ...and I showed him her picture. Mr. Van Borsen please? Was there anything written on that photo? I'm sure there wasn't. He's lying! He didn't see the back! Mr. Van Borsen, you are still under oath. I know Your Honour. You were bribed off a non-existing affair? Yes, but I had a plan. He thought that Fanny was living with me. With that money, I saw my chance... ...of playing this rich gent a nasty trick... ...because I remembered Fanny's stories about him. Giving her a black eye now and then. Silence please! Is that correct? Yes, it is. I once lost my temper. According to the suspect the affair was already over. She didn't say so. Maybe she was only pretending. She did badger him as much as she could. Let's stick to the facts. Could you explain your "playing him a nasty trick"? Fanny had disappeared two weeks before... ...and I wanted Van Borsen to finance her disappearance. So you were going to give the money to her? That's right, but first I had to find her. Bonk and I passed ourselves off as private detectives. A bit like colleagues of Holly. You found her in a nightclub? Yes, then we drove to my mother's... ...and I gave her the money and the photo. Too bad she's addicted... She took some stuff and a brandy or two... got hysterical and tore up the photo. We put her to the guest-room. Next day she was scared to death... ...thinking her father had her traced again. Again. He did so before. Fanny was unbalanced. I can explain her behaviour myself. I'm asking for facts! Fanny wanted to stay... ...but after a while, mother wanted her to fo. I tried to talk to her, but she had been smoking. I couldn't get through to her. Suddenly she ran away. She vanished in thin air. Shortly after I heard the sirens. I know what Van Holl thinks, but I didn't murder her. Did you see Miss Van Borsen tearing up the photo? Yes, and what about the pieces... ...they got lost, of course. I think so. No. You know about this? I picked them up and stuck them together. You still have it? Yes, Your Honour. Could this be regarded as evidence? Request granted. Did you erase the inscription? I did. Why? Well... eh... you see... Because it was meant for someone else? That's right. I see. You may sit down. I propose suspension. I don't understand. Wait for the verdict. The court has come to the conclusion... ...that the charge cannot be sustained... ...so the suspect will be acquitted. We can use him to get Van Borsen. Congratulations. What for? You're free! Be careful, otherwise you'll be the third corpse. There'll be a third one, but not mine! I'll keep an eye on you. Safe feeling. "Welcome Newly Weds" Alice and Bonk, congratulations on this special day. For me it's rather sad... ...because I'll miss my fishing pal. Alice, you got a fine husband, he can handle his rod... ...but let me tell you... Go on, have fun. A party for me? We got married and we didn't... ...want a murdered. I did! Shut up. My jewels are for you. You shouldn't have done it... Don't you dare wear one of those! I wanted to invite you... ...but they all think you did it! We've got to keep things happy like! You lost me? I need your help. What with? Mending socks? I'll explain. I'll prepare the funeral! Sit down. Just tap on the glass, as usual and count. Ready. Tap on the glass! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... That's enough. Once more. This is useless... Come back tomorrow. I'll never go there again! O.K. I'll go. You. Tomorrow we go on our honeymoon... ...you wanna help that knife-thrower? Out of my house! My lovely hunk of man! Come on up! Who are you anyway? Auntie sent me. Who's that? Minnie. Was she too scared to come herself? Yes, but I ain't. How old are you? Sev... sixteen. You're just a little squirt. What's your name? Scuffy... Scuffy? It's Angela really. What did you come for? Auntie said I had to help you. There's the kitchen. Take a shower. Cut your nails. Hurry up! Where do you live? At Auntie Minnie's. Never saw you before. When I came, you were in jail. Don't you have any parents? They drove into a ravine when they were on holiday. Don't come any closer! What's your job? Cleaning, shopping and cooking and so on. What do you earn? Board and ten guilders. Per day? No, per week. Come on, let's go shopping. Dress up that kid. She looks like a scare crow. Three dresses, two coats, as long as you stay under five hundred. Five hundred what? Bananas. What's the matter? What's going on? I'm employing you. Board and sixty a week. And Auntie Minnie? I'll fix that. Auntie says you killed the girl... I don't believe it. Pass me the gravy. We were tailed today. I didn't kill the girl. Wait... I won't say another word. Dinner O.K.? I was a bit hasty in employing you. Why? You know what I do for my keep? Sure, those rich types just hog their jewels... Well you swipe and sell them. Short and sweet, without Marx. Without what? Can I sit there? You noticed we were followed. That's smart. Are you gonna kill Van Borsen with that knife? Go back to Auntie Minnie. Back again? I never went away. You've got a swell attic, Uncle Glimmy. Coffee. How do you know about those letters? Fanny told Bonk about them. Are you gonna sell those letters? I'm a burglar. I profit from people's riches... a blackmailer from their misery. Don't ask such stupid things. After him again? But he's going to the airport again! I must make sure. Van Borsen on the go, Jack and Jill to the show. I GOT THEM! I'll open the door. First look. A guy with a package. Shall I open? For such a guy we never open. Why not? Use your brains. In his left hand a package, in the right a gun. You open up... "Good afternoon"... Boom! I'm not going into the street anymore. Auntie Minnie put her peep-mirror on the other side. She watches our door for Holly. If she doesn't put it back, I'll smash it. That detective spoke to me. I told him that he was ridiculous... ...spying when there's nothing to spy on. If he doesn't stop, I'll tell Holly... ...that guy says dirty things to me. I'm only sixteen. There he is again! One, two three, four... Holly is at Auntie Minnie's. It's mean and dirty of her. Glimmy!!!! Glimmy!!!! Help!!!! Go inside and stay! My peep-mirror saved them! My peep-mirror! Nice letters to a step-daughter. That was about it. What's it matter to you? And you're the kind of cop who'd never bother with our kind. That something else can cost me my life. Don't worry anymore. What's going on? I don't see what you mean. One evening I talk with some banker... then... ...everyone wants to know about it. First Van Holl who warns me. The a guy who almost kills me, who's killed afterwards. After my acquittal Van Holl warns me again. Then there's Van Borsen's weekly flight to God-knows-where. I'm almost killed again. Van Holl's just in time, so he's in the picture. What is this mystery? I can't tell you, but you're right. There's more to all this... When you stole the letters, was there anything else? Something like a testament. Bakker is very clever... but who's pulling who's leg? You Bakker's. He gave me the hint to get the papers out of that safe. And then, "O.K., thanks for the papers, bye-bye". I help them, but in my way. Let's go on holiday. It's so ever super here! It gives me the creeps! You wanna go rowing? I don't know how. Me neither. This ain't no fun. You just sit fretting. Let's start. Drink some milk before bed! He comes in a taxi! Hasn't got the girl with him. That's guts! Robbery by taxi. Attention. The devil! Glimmy's in top form. Van Holl speaking. Everything is quiet on the canal. The whole area is sealed off. How will he get away? He won't. Nothing to report. In the street, nothing. Still nothing. I wonder what he'll come up with. A burglar should crack a safe in a hour. Nothing, dammit. There's still a light on. Van Borsen can come any minute. We're being fooled. Let's go to his house. You can keep the money. The papers! Come and get them. One move and I'll shoot. Charming. Dead... May I Inspector? These are the papers. What about Glimmy? Self-defence. Are you O.K.? Not a scratch. It's all over. Is he dead? Good for him! You stay here. I have to talk to Van Holl. It's super, Uncle Glimmy. Cut that "uncle", it's giving me the creeps. THE END
