Subtitles by OnDemandKorea Our Sunny Days Hey! You just stood and took a counterpunch like an idiot. Why did you even bother going in the ring? You're so frustrating. You were KO'd twice. You can't go after the champion title at this rate! You're still here? How are you feeling? You should consider yourself lucky today. Did you just laugh at me? I wasn't laughing. Hey. Do I look funny to you? You lost. Big deal. Yes, I lost. So what? Damn it. Why you little! - Hey! - Stop! (Do-chul: Jung Woo-sung Who is it? Is your mom home? My mom's not here. You shouldn't lie, brat. She answered her phone earlier when I called. Hey! You brat! You nearly broke my fingers! Open this door right now. Then just give me money. I'll leave right away! Then she shouldn't have given birth! She should take responsibility since she gave birth! I refuse to leave! I'm going to stay here until I get the money! Don't ever come here again. That's the last time. I won't come. I won't. I did everything I can for you. We're struggling to get by too. I don't want to come here too. I won't come even if you beg me to. Let him out. Please just give me one more month. I'll really... I'll really... give you the money. I swear it on my life. Your life? Do you really bet you life on it? Yes. I really mean it, sir. I told you not to call me that. I warned you not to call me that. I'm sorry, sir. You never listen to what I say, do you? Right? Come here. Come here. Come. Get back to where you were. Get back to where you were! Hong-ki. Do you know what kind of people I hate the most in the world? People who borrow money and don't pay me back. People who don't have the guts to deal with the consequences. That's... you. I'm sorry. Jeez, why did he have to hit my face? (Hong-ki: Lee Jung-jae) Hello? Follow me. (Errand Services) (Horse Racing) You can start working tomorrow. I'm giving you the job because Mr. Shin introduced you. Thank you. I heard you've been living at the gym. Do you have a place to stay? I don't. Hong-ki. (Milk) How old are you? I was born in 1974. So you're two years younger than me. You're supposed to call me "Director." But you can just call me by my name. Tell me if you need anything. Okay? My gosh. Are you laughing at me? Are you? So we're like a PI's office. But... you shouldn't say you work at a PI's office. Laws don't approve of that. How much do they pay you? It depends on the job. Are you going to keep talking without honorifics? Then show me. What? Show me your ID. I can show you right now. You were born later than '74, right? Were you born in '75? I'll show you my ID. Yes, go ahead. - I will. - Jeez. I'll show you. - I said go ahead. - I will. - Show me. - I mean it. - I'm going to show you. - Yes, go ahead. - Show me. - I'll show you. Okay, wait a second. I told you not to follow me around! Don't ever trust that guy. He's the boss's spy. He told me that you're a swindler. Hey. You trust the word of a guy like him? Don't ever try to con me. It's boring to dig up people's dirty little secrets. Let's be honest. Everything we're doing is illegal. You saw the movie, "Two Cops," right? Park Joong-hoon plays by the book. But Ahn Sung-ki doesn't. Who do you think is smarter? Ahn Sung-ki's house comes out in the movie. Didn't it look amazing? That's why people need money. These days, if you own a building, you're someone of power. Why? Because it means you have money. These days, if you rent, you're a loser and... Hey, hey. You pay monthly rent. And you are living off of me. I pay ten dollars every day. That's money too. Here. Last year, this building was worth over 6 million dollars. But it dropped to around 3 million dollars this year. Just you wait. Six years! The maximum time it will take me to buy this building is six years. I say the minimum is 60 years. Hey. You idiot! Guard! - Go, go! - You should punch and fall back! Hong-ki. It's been a while. I heard you're working now. Are you having fun? It's okay. You were a boxer for five years. You can do anything. Work hard. Mi-mi! Next time, make sure you bring photos... I will. Do-chul, say hello. She's Mi-mi. She's a friend of mine. Hello. I should get going. Contact me later. Doesn't she have a great body? No, she's too skinny. Is she your girlfriend? Hey, I know plenty of girls like her. But she's someone I'm paying special attention to. I want to help her become an actress. You work as a celebrity agent too? You know I do everything. Hey, in recession... You must've had a headache from all this. Do you know what kind of people I hate the most? They're people who don't get a clue. You know Hulk, right? You know he always warns people. "Don't make me angry." "Please." But people never get a clue. And then he becomes a monster right away. You know the green monster. They're ripped apart. You know? Please don't make me angry. - I don't have the money to pay you back! - Hey! Hey! You shouldn't be so shameless. You're putting me in a tight spot. He's a boxer. I wasn't going to use violence to solve this but... Hey, do you think you scare me? Kid. I had my share of fun in the past too. Do-chul. Hey, hurry up and let's go. How dare you kids threaten me? You all claim you're boxers when you're collecting debt. Are you guys thugs? Go ahead and throw a punch! What are you glaring at? Do-chul! Hey, Do-chul! Go ahead! Punch me! Hey! Hey, stop! Hey! Come on! Do-chul! Come on! Hey, hey! Jeez! Do-chul, that's enough! That's enough. Stop! Hey, that's enough! Stop! You're driving me crazy! That's enough! I'll pay you back right now... Please... You did the job perfectly. These are bonuses for you. Thank you. Good job. I put in a little extra for you, Do-chul. Buy yourself some clothes. Thank you. What about me? Hey. If you went alone, you would've never gotten the money. Whenever you have money, you use it all to buy clothes. Stop doing that. Honey. Do you have a car? A car? I don't. Then how do you get around? The subway. Then what do you ride after midnight? I walk. Last week, I walked from Sinseol to Moraenae. What? What did I do? Girls don't like boxing these days! You should've talked about something funny! Hey! I'm not a comedian! I helped you get a girl and you messed that up! Hurry up and find another girl. Hong-ki! Mi-mi! Why aren't you bringing your photos? I have so many people I need to introduce you to! Hong-ki, I met the real deal this time! You see him there, right? The man in the brown suit. His name is Mr. Cha. You're going to ruin your life in the blink of an eye if you hang out with a jerk like him! - I told you to always... - Hello! You're a boxer, right? Not anymore. So you're saying... my wife hired you to follow me? That's why I filmed you. Then why are you showing this to me? Just because. Why don't you just think of this as... giving away a diamond for free? (Personal Check: $1,000) Do-chul! Come here! I saw everything. Chang-min! Why are you here? - I was passing by. - Why are you here? There's no way you were just passing by. You're being used by Mr. Moon right now. I get paid a salary! - Hey, hey. Come on! - I get paid. You're driving me insane! You get paid so little! Mr. Moon is taking advantage of you! Hey, do you even know what that means? I don't! Hey, stop right there! It's good to see you again. (Coca-Cola Independence Day 815) (Korea Racing Authority, TV Racetrack) Why are you trying to become an actress? I just want to. People often ask me that. Do you really want to know? Of course. I don't want to answer. Everybody laughs whenever they hear my response. I won't laugh. Tell me. I don't want to. But wait and see. I'm confident I will become one. You have a nosebleed. Thanks. It's okay. This happens sometimes. After a game, you're so tired that you want to sleep. But they tell you to never fall asleep. Because your mind needs to be busy to prevent any blood hemorrhaging in your head from coagulating. What do you think about? Women? It's usually food. Because I can barely eat since I have to lose weight. I don't get it. Why would you do something like that when it's taking a toll on your body? I should get going now. I have plans. Wait here for a minute. Next time I see you, I'll call you by your name. You're home early. Hey, I met Mi-mi earlier. Hong-ki. Hong-ki. Come on. Hey, what's wrong? You don't want to look at my face? Hong-ki. - Hey! - Let go. What happened to your face? - Leave me alone. - Hey! Who did this? Who did this? Which scumbag did this to you? Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Just leave me alone! How dare you stab me in the back? I provided you food and shelter! I helped you make a living! How dare you swindle money from me? You bastard. Hand over your cellphone, the office key, and the car key. And get out. Now! I never told you to leave. You have a lot to do. There are only people asking us to collect debt on their behalf these days. I want to quit too. Hey. You quit because I quit? Don't be ridiculous. It has nothing to do with you. When I debuted as a pro at 19 years old, I won the title of "Best Newcomer." Everybody was raving that I was a rising star. Back then, everybody lost to this. It seemed like I was going to become a champion right away. Hey, becoming a champion must make you lots of money. How can you think of everything in terms of money? Hey, money is everything. If we have money, we could buy a building. And your champion belt? We can buy that with money too! Hey. What do you know about boxing? What do you know? Why are you angry all of a sudden? I didn't go to college. No, I chose not to go. Why? You learn life on the streets. Not from school. And people don't get rich based on their grades. Absolutely not! You couldn't go to college too, right? I did. You did? I attended on a sports scholarship but I quit. I guess everybody gets into college these days. That's why I don't like it. It makes you like everybody else. When I get money, I'm going to make my own college! You know people donate and get admitted into schools, right? I'll accept 90 percent of the students based on donations. Doesn't that sound great? People who have money can get into my college by buying their way in! - Really? - Yes! Hey, hey! You said you have no plans. - You said you don't know what to do. - Hey. I don't want to work with you anymore. So mind your own business. Do what you want on your own. Hey. You know the drama series, "Korea Ghost Stories," right? A mountain spirit says this to the main character. "No matter what happens behind you," "don't ever look back." Yes, yes. "Don't ever look back." But those idiots always look back and becomes statues! Why? It's because of their damn curiosity. You know what is important to people? Trust! - Trust. - Yes. You just need to trust me and follow my lead! Hey, hey. Hey, you always say something ridiculous. in a difficult way to confuse people. You know who Hong Soo-hwan is, right? I do. Older brother of Hong Soo-chul who sang "Immature Love." - Yes. - Yes. He nearly lost the game to that man, Carrasquilla. But he kept looking back and... - What are you talking about? - Hey, hey. He kept going over his mistakes. And... He made the miraculous comeback in the following round. So you know people should... People should... - They... - Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Be quiet. - People... - Hey. Damn it! You made me forget what I was going to say! Hey! I'll take you somewhere fun tomorrow. I'm not going. I'm going with Mi-mi though. Hello. I'm Cho Hong-ki from Star Production. You know our Mi-mi, right? Since when did you have a manager? Come with me. There are many people I have to introduce you to. So let's go say hello. My office is near here. You have a great vibe and a great body. She does, right? - She's very... - Hey, hey. - Talented. - You stay out of it. Go drink over there. Okay. I will. Mi-mi. See you later. You said your name is Mi-mi, right? Yes... You know...how this industry works, right? It's no joke. Mi-mi, let's dance together. Do-chul, I'll be right back. I'll be back soon. Director Lee wants to audition you. You're okay with it, right? Of course. But nothing good will come out from you hanging out with them. Let's play together, Mi-mi. - Party with us. - Do-chul. - Hey. - We're going to talk first. - Play with us. - Guys like you don't belong here. - Do you understand? - I don't understand!

You're embarrassing me! Stop. Are you embarrassed of me? You're embarrassed because of me? You're embarrassed? Come here! - Hey. - That's enough. - That's enough. Stop. - Do I embarrass you too? Why are you drunk and making a scene? It's embarrassing. What? What did I do? Damn it! Hey! What did I do? What did I do? Hey, you guys are full of it! Why am I embarrassing to you? Don't be ridiculous! Why am I embarrassing? You guys are no better than me! Hey, call the police. Now! Yes, report me. Call the police. - Sure, call the police! - Get him out of here! Hey, don't be ridiculous. You're not funny at all. Hey, call the police! Go ahead! Hey. Did you guys just laugh? Did you laugh at me? Did you laugh? What are you glaring at? Why? Are you going to punch me? Do you want to go at it? Hey, that's enough! Talking to people like them will just annoy us even more. - Let's go. - Watch your back. Let's go. Did you try contacting her? Who? Who do you think? Mi-mi, of course. Why would I contact her? You said you took the settlement. Aren't you going to tell me how much? Right, right. I'm sorry. This is all I got out of him. I couldn't ask for more because of Mi-mi. - What is this? - I couldn't ask for a lot. A thousand dollars? What was I supposed to do? What is this? - What? - This. I'm talking about this. It's my cellphone. I bought a new one earlier. What are you doing? Take off your jacket. Hey. Take off your jacket. Hey, don't you trust me? Don't you? Fine, I'll take it off. - Yes. - I will. Hey. I spent the whole day getting the settlement for you. How can you do this to me? So take off your jacket. Jeez! I got two thousand. I figured you and I were going to split it evenly. Show me everything. What? Have you lost your mind? Fine, you keep everything! Four thousand dollars? You can have it all! Here. Half of it is yours. You're the one who got it from them. I'm not that badly hurt anyway. Hey. You know me, right? I was so worried about you. Hey, can you deposit this into my bank account? The check book is in my bag. Don't lose it, okay? Okay. Hey. When you're discharged, let's go on a vacation! To the East Sea! Hong-ki. Hong-ki! Who is it? Oh, yeah! Who is it? Oh, yeah! This is the 15th time I'm leaving you a message. I don't even have the energy to get mad at you now. So you better call me back. I'm willing to forgive you if you just show up with my money. I mean it. Cho Hong-ki. Please... I never thought you would do this to me. I'm going to kill you when I catch you. You think I'm joking, right? Message deleted. You have no more new messages. It's me, Do-chul. I'm sorry about last time. I guess I drank too much. I... I called you because I was wondering if you were in contact with Hong-ki. Please call me back when you get this message. It's important. Turn your head. Pardon? Let me see your profile. Soo-kyung. Not anyone can become an actress. You're not good at acting, right? I don't have enough experience... I'm sure you don't. Because it's your first time. You know the drama, "Korea Ghost Stories," right? People should do what they love to do. You should still not to do it. Why? Why are you telling me not to do it? Weren't you ever like me? How could you not understand how I feel too? Kid. Do I look happy to you right now? I don't have a house or a car! Let me be honest with you. You don't have the talent to become a champion now. I'm sorry to tell you that. Hey. I'm not doing this to become a champion. I can't believe you're doing this. I'm going to get mad. I'm just letting you borrow it. Please don't feel pressured. Hurry up and take this back. You can use my car too. I can use my mom's car. I'll use it for a few days and I'll return it with a little extra on top of it. I'm building a production building in Apgujeong right now. But I'm having a little difficulty with cash right now. What a load of crap. I'm going to have a business talk over there for a little. Soo-kyung. Why don't you go over there and I'll... Hey, take this and go. You nearly got conned by the worst of con artists. Who are you to say that? Who are you calling a con artist? Hurry up and put that away. Leave! Soo-kyung! - Come with me! - Hey! Soo-kyung! Let go of me! - No. - Do you how much she has in her account? You asshole! You bastard! I can't believe you're doing this to me! What do you mean? What did I do to you? What did you do with my money? What did you do with my money, you asshole? - Give me my money. - Let go. - No. Give me my money back. - Let go. - Give it back. - I will. - I will give it back. - Give it to me. - I said give it to me! - Let go! Jeez. I'll give it to you. You asshole! You...asshole! What? What, asshole? Damn it! Jeez! Give me my money. Give me back my money! I don't have it. I used it all. (Police) (Kansan Gym) (Police Who Help People When They Seek Help) I'm sorry. Do-chul! Come on. Hey. Ow! Damn it! Hey, your punch got stronger. I told you I'm sorry. Hey, aren't we even with that punch now? I'm hungry. Buy me a meal. Let go. You have a lot of money. Jeez, let go. Who are they? Let's just go. What's going on? Let's just keep walking. Why are they following us? Hey, just... - Why are you following us? - Hey, hey. - Stay out of this. - Let's go. Hong-ki! Come here. Let go. - Let's go. - Let go for a second. - Do-chul. - I said come here! You asshole. I told you I won't fight. Damn it! Then do whatever you want to do! Damn it! 1, 2. 1, 2. Go. Are you okay? Are you really okay? You improved a lot. I think you can compete now. Really? Hey. Do you want to do a game? Not yet. You said I can. Let's put him in the ring. He can't do it. I'll do it. It will be a match before Sung-hoon's Eastern Championship match. You get what I'm saying, right? You just need to last until the fourth round. It will be too boring if you lose the match too early. Make it short. Go. 1, 2. Am I that bad compared to Sung-hoon? He's not the old Sung-hoon now. It will be a miracle if you even last until the third round. It's a very important part. And I got through to the final round. Nothing has been decided yet. But I think I'll get the part. This game is very important to me too. If I win... the director of the gym may give me a chance to compete in the championship. What are you doing? I'm going to sleep first. Hey, if people hear you listening to this kind of music these days, they'll call you a Neanderthal. Hurry up and back that back on. Hey, isn't it amazing? Hey, especially this part. You know I usually don't accept cars that aren't paid off, right? I'm accepting it because it's you. Thank you, sir. Hey. Byung-kook is going crazy, looking for you. I think the interest is ten times more than the principal now. Go give him this first. Tell him you borrowed it from me. And that you'll pay him back the rest as soon as possible. He's human too. I'm sure he won't kill you. I'll put in a good word for you when I meet him. You still... don't want to work with me? Sir. I'm really sorry to say this. But I really don't think selling porno is my line of work. I'm 25 years old now. I refuse to do any business unless it's a proper business now! I know people think I'm full of air. I know all that. It's because they don't understand my business ideas. Just you wait. All I need is one idea to make it big! When I make it, everybody will say that I'm brilliant! Contact me if you ever want to work, kid. Oh, my. I left my wallet. I left it at the store earlier. I'll be right back. No, I should go. Go stay in the car. I'll be right back. There is a job you could do. But you need Do-chul. Without Do-chul, you're useless. I bought you a gift. Aren't you grateful? You said you would never work for Mr. Moon again. And why would you bring me up? You know I would never do it. Don't you need money? What? Can you live without money? And let's be honest. There's no chance of you winning this game. You think I'm going to lose all the time, right? Yes, everybody does. No one thinks I will win. But do you think I'll really lose? - Hey. - Hey, tell them to piss off. Let's see who wins. Just wait. I feel confident. That's why I'm competing. I will win. And if you win? What will you do if you win? How much do you get if you do win? And in order to become a champion, you need to fight many more guys stronger than you... Do you know the real reason I'm trying to get on the ring? Do you know why I'm trying to box? It's because of the disease that's giving you nosebleeds. You're being stubborn. No. Absolutely not. I... I can't tell you everything I'm feeling. Because I'm never good with words. But... I'm not doing this because of money. Do-chul. Hey, I'm really trying to... I'm really... trying to prove that... the way I've been boxing for a long time... is not wrong. Got it? If you're going to keep asking me to do useless things, stop coming here. Hey. I'm not coming here because I want to. Do you think I have nowhere else to go? If I stay a week at every girl's place I know... the 20th century will just fly by. Then you should go there. What? I said go there. Hey. You do that when you hit rock bottom. Am I at rock bottom right now? Hey, move back! Get out of the way! Turn! Put your head down! Stop! That's enough! Hey! Hey! Stop! That's enough! Stop! What's wrong? Are you sick? Hey, I'm okay. Let me do it again. Do-chul! Do-chul! Why are you just taking his punches? Get out of the way! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop. Do-chul, get a hold of yourself. Do-chul, are you okay? Are you okay? Why? Go down. Go down and take a break. Do-chul. What are your symptoms? Do-chul. Tell me. Are you really okay? - Hey! - I'm fine! Let go! Please! I told you I'm fine! Damn it! I told you I'm fine! How did you know I was here? I heard you're going to leave the gym. Where are you going to stay now? Did you think over what I mentioned yesterday night? We will be doing Mr. Moon a favor. So let's just help him out once. Stop. What? I said get lost. How can you tell a friend to get lost? You're hurting my feelings. I said get lost! Fine. Why don't you reconsider... Hey! Do-chul, come out for a second. I'm sorry. Something important came up. You don't even have a little time? I don't. I need to go to an audition. Do you want to meet tomorrow? I'll call you at the gym tomorrow. I quit. I won't go there now. You did? I should go. Go back inside. Do-chul, get in! I said get in! He's crazy. Hey, the rain's bad for you. You're going to lose all your hair! Hey, I get it! We won't do it! I won't do the job either! You're going to catch a cold from being in the rain so stop! Hey, I said you don't have to do the job! Mr. Lee Do-chul! Left! Right! Wow, his punches are strong! Another hook! Upper! Tyson is stumbling! 1, 2. Right and left combination blow! Tyson is groggy now! It looks like Mr. Lee Do-chul will win the match! My goodness! What is happening? Tyson bit Mr. Lee's nose! My goodness, what a shame, Mr. Lee! Get in. I won't bring up the job again. Let's do it. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. (Fresh Fruits) - Goodbye. - Bye. - Say bye to Dad. - Bye. They left. After I ran away from home when I was 17 years old... I did everything. Who sent you guys? He borrowed money to start a distribution business but he went bankrupt. The creditors want their money back. But he's refusing to pay them. People who think lightly of taking other people's money... need to learn a lesson. I feel like if I have just 10,000 dollars, I can start something... But for some reason, the opportunity never comes to me... Listen up, Do-chul. When opportunity comes knocking at your door, you need to seize it. You can't just do what you like in life. I realize that now. From now on... I'm really going to quit boxing. Don't lie. How dare you refuse to pay back what you owe? Hong-ki. Byung-kook was asking me where you lived. So I told him I don't know. Don't worry and just get this job done. Just wait and see. It will take me six years. In six years, I'm going to win this game. I'll give it to you right away when it's over. You know I keep my promises, right? There's nobody around. Sweety. Mom, close the door! You need money to be treated like a human. And people don't look down on you. No! - No! - Move! Do you know the odds of last year's horse racing bets were 1 to 3,600? If I had bet just a thousand dollars, I would've made 3.6 million dollars! I would've money left over after buying this 3-million dollar building! Do-chul, what are you waiting for? Hey, get a hold of yourself! - Hey. - Go in! Is money really the best thing in the world? If you rent this building out, your monthly income alone will be a hundred thousand dollars! Then with that money... you can go to a hostess bar all week! You can drink liquor every day! And you can have fun with those ladies who look as pretty as actresses and... Then what do you think is the best? Let's go. Come on! Hey, we need to get him to pay first! I said let's go! Damn it! Mom. My mom. She died last year. Let's just go sleep at the gym today. I have somewhere I need to go. See you tomorrow. I'm sorry about earlier. Did your audition go well? No. Why am I always like this? Do you think my dream of becoming an actress is an impossible one? Is that what you think? Something happened, right? Today... I auditioned for a cosmetic product commercial. But I didn't get the job again. But I'm not sad at all. Because... Because I'm confident I'll make it. Hey, mister! How much is this? I only have five dollars. Just let me have it for five. Hey. If you exchange this, it costs ten dollars. So how can you ask for it for just five dollars? You're so stingy. What? How old are you? I'm old enough. Why? Do your parents tell you to buy and watch these kinds of things? Do your parents tell you to sell these kinds of things to kids? You're not old enough watch things like this. You're too young for this. Yeah, right. Hey, you wench! Why that little! My goodness! That bitch. Cho Hong-ki! Make sure you stay hidden. If I catch you now, you're dead meat. Make sure you stay silent, Hong-ki. I hear everything. Yes. Stay still like that. Hong-ki. You're a man! Be brave! You're no better than a bug, you bastard. I'll give you three days. Three days! If you don't come to me by then... then you'll be gone forever. Don't forget it, Hong-ki. You're a good cook. By the way, my uncle is a managing director at a department store. I asked him to give you a job. Why? You don't want it? No. I'll think about it. What is there to think about? You need to work. Hello? Yes, sir. Yes, yes. When? The film studio? Yes, I have time right now. I'll be back. I might come home late. Cho Hong-ki. It's been over three days. Do you think you can escape me? Let's end this now. I prepared something for you. You can look forward to it. Do-chul, it's me. Can you call me back right away? Do-chul! Whose car is this? I stole it. Get in the driver's seat. Please hurry! I beg you! Tell me what's going on. Please just trust me and help me once. Keep the engine running. Five minutes. Four minutes. - Stop! Let's go! - Let go! - Let go! - You bastard! - Let's go! - Let go before I kill you! Let go! Let go! Let go! You asshole, do you really want to go to jail? Yes, I would rather go there! You bastard! If you're scared, you can go! You asshole. I'm not done yet! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Hong-ki, we need to leave. - I need to take these. - They're coming! Do-chul, I need to take these! Hey, hey! We need to leave now! Let go! I need to take those! Do-chul! Damn it. I can't see anything. Did you have a fight with Mi-mi? I think she's too good for me. You two seem to get along well. Be good to her. How much is your debt? Don't ask. It's too painful to think about. Cho Hong-ki! You'll be fine from now on! Byung-kook, that son of a bitch! I'm not scared of you, you asshole! Hong-ki! You bastard... I never said I was going to die! You were trying to die! Hey! Why are you crying? Do you think... I'm a coward too? No. I'm the coward. I'm too afraid to even go on the ring now. Damn it. This is nice. I never saw sunrise at the beach. I knew it. You're a city bumpkin. You're right... There's no sun like that in the city. I wish I could live somewhere like this forever. Hey. Don't be ridiculous. You wouldn't even last a month here. You're right. Let's go back to the city. Mi-mi. Where were you? If you disappear without a word like that, I won't ever see you again. I'm sorry. This is really the last time, Mom! I won't ever ask you a favor again! I'm really struggling right now too. My husband had a stroke a month ago. My life depends on this! Then at least lend me any amount that you have right now. I'll really pay you back. I don't have money! Until now, the only income we had was from the store rent! Come to your senses, you fool! You're young! You can do anything! Why would you come to your mom and throw a tantrum? That's enough. I understand. Whatever. I should go. Hong-ki. Do you know tomorrow is your birthday? You should at least buy yourself some seaweed soup. It's fine. Ta-da! I got the deposit! 50 percent of my pay! - Really? - Yes! My practice starts tomorrow! I think I'm going to start being busy! What do you want, Do-chul? I'll buy everything you want! I'm so happy for you. What should we eat? Let's eat something good! Open up! It's me, Hong-ki. Hey, what's all this? Hey, don't you even know your friend's birthday? - Today's my birthday. - Oh, my! Today's your birthday? Hey, Mi-mi! It's been a while! - Come in! - Okay! Is it really your birthday today? I'm hurt. I really am. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you, Hong-ki! Make a wish! Hey, blow out the candles. - What are you waiting for? - Make a wish. I went all the way over there. You went after it? Hey. Did you have a talk with Byung-kook? I don't pay any attention to him. Good. What can he do to me? You're right. - What can he do? - He cut his hair like an old lady's. We're out of alcohol. We're out of alcohol. I'll go buy some more. Hey, should I give you money? No, it's okay. Do you need anything else? No. Mi-mi, I'll go with you. - I'll be right back. - Okay. Okay. You're unbelievable! How dare you try to steal her money? I told you I wasn't going to steal it. You weren't? I would never steal Mi-mi's money. Don't deny it! I saw you! Hey, I just saw it and I was wondering where the money came from. Shut up, you asshole! How can you call yourself my friend? Yes. You're perfect, aren't you? I was always an asshole. Didn't you know that? Punch me! Go ahead! A coward like you deserves to learn a lesson from that bastard, Byung-kook! Damn it! Ever since I met you... nothing has gone my way, you bastard! No matter how much I think about it... I think you bring bad luck. I don't ever want to see you again. Don't ever show up in front of Mi-mi too. Hey. Hey, how could you say that? Stop right there! Hey, take this. Don't follow me! I'm going to kill you if you do! Where is that jerk? He left. Don't ever see him again. No good will come out from staying friends with a jerk like him! Don't talk about him like that. - He really cares about you. - Are you taking his side? How can you say that even after all this? - He must've been desperate to... - Don't you remember? He took your money too! When will you ever learn? Are you an idiot? He always lies and now he's even stealing... I said that's enough! Why are you yelling at me? I'm sorry. Let's stop, okay? Please stop talking bad about him. Why should I stop? Is that jerk more important to you than me? Hey. You have no right to say that either. What do you mean? Why not? I hate that you changed right away now that your situation is different! You think I changed? Do you think I'm acting like this because I got that part? Did you do anything to help me become successful? Yes. You're right. We're too different. Did you just realize that now? A boxer from Kangsan Gym. Lee Do-chul! And on the opposite side, Sung-hoon! Do like you did in practice. Be light on your feet. Don't go overboard. Take it easy. What is this? That's all I could bring. I sold everything I could. Everything I owned. Please give me a little more time. This is the last favor I ask of you, sir. I told you not to call me that. Even if you brought all the money, I wouldn't have forgiven you. Do you know why? I'm sorry, sir. I don't like you. When I look at you, I get so annoyed. You don't need to pay me back now. What's your blood type? Making that face won't make a difference. You didn't sell your organs yet. You should sell the rest. Don't you agree? Think of it as doing one last good deed before you die. Hello? Is that you? Please stop calling me about things like that. I'm having a hard time too these days. My profits are a third of what they were. Even if you keep calling me like this... Go! Go for it. Good. That's it. Do you understand? Turn in that direction, okay? Make the punches short. Make short, consecutive punches. - What the hell? - Hey! Hey, mister! I know a great place! I'm telling you I'll make sure you have a great night! Win! Win! Win! Start! Damn it! Don't be too disappointed. You'll get another chance. Trust me. Come at me. Why did you come? You're really shameless. I don't have money. I don't have money for you. It's hard enough paying the hospital bills! Don't stay up all night taking care of him. You're going to get sick too. I'll get going now. One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Sung-hoon, go slowly! Start! Give it to her. Take it. Do you know it's your mom's birthday the day after tomorrow? You're going to be really pretty when you grow up. Get a hold of yourself! Nice! Nice! Hey. Don't ever throw in the towel, okay? Don't, okay? Go for it! Yes, that's right! Good! Stretch your arms! Right! Right! Yes, that's it! Sung-hoon, hurry! Three! Four! Eight! Hey, Sung-hoon! Three! Three! Four! Five! Eight! Start! Come at me. Punch me. Here. It's nice to get punched! Damn it! Punch me! Come on! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey! Hey! Get a hold of yourself! Hey, get a hold of yourself! Eight! Out! Do-chul! It's over! It's done. It's over. It's over. What are you doing? I can do it. Let me go again! Let me go again! - It's over! - I can keep going! I can keep going! Damn it! You bastards! How can you say it's over? Hey! You bastards! Damn it! Hey! I can keep going! I can keep going! Did you see the match? It was incredible. I didn't know you were so good. Hong-ki. I could've really won. Damn it. I could've really won. Hey, we should've called before we came here. Is there something bothering you? What would I worry about? Damn it. Mi-mi will throw a fit when she sees me again. You said you had a fight with her too. Let's just go. Let's wait a little longer. We have nowhere to go anyway. When Mi-mi comes, you apologize first. I should. Hey. Ow... I thought of a great business idea. Do you want to join me? How much money do you have? Do you always need money to start a business? Jeez. Why are you laughing? You crazy fool. Are you an idiot? Jeez! Why did you hit me? It's too early for that. Damn it. Subtitles by OnDemandKorea
