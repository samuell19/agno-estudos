Are we starting now? I'm nervous. It's okay. This will be fun. It must've been around the end of September. - 1:30PM on September 21st. - You're so detailed! I had a meeting out of the office that day. I usually take the subway, but the weather was so nice. - I just felt like taking the bus. - Me too. But the bus suddenly screeched to a stop. I woke up two hours later at the emergency room, and she was standing there on the verge of tears. And that's how it all started. It was fate. COUPLES MADAGASCAR WE DON'T SERVE COFFEE - I'm gonna be a good housewife. - You are? What will you do for me if I do? Whatever you want, of course. Really? - I just have to ask? - Sure. What do you want? Well... Money. - I like money. - Money? Yes. Money to buy a big house for us to grow old in. - Really? - Uh-huh. Yeah, Mom? Didn't you say we sold that land? Hey, Kyu-taek. Could I borrow some cash? Hey, it's me. I know this is out of the blue, but can you be my guarantor? Hello? This is the bank, right? I'm calling about a loan... One! - Two! Three! - Ta-da! Ta-da! This is our home now, Na-ri! You said you'd find her in a week. Is it that you're lazy, or just bad? I'm close to finding her. - I'll have good news soon. - Come on. You've been saying that for two months, Bok-nam. Is your detective agency really legit? I'm having doubts. - Just wait a little more. - Seriously, Bok-nam... I'm worried sick about her. I'm sort of busy right now. Just give it some time, okay? Fine. Just call me soon. - I'm going to the restroom. - Okay. - Have a wonderful night, sir. - So it's all set? Good. That was the last I saw of her. Just one minute. She'll be back. She went to the bathroom and has been gone for two months. Leaving me a single text message. ''I'LL SEND SOMEONE FOR MY THINGS.'' Does that make any sense? It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense at all! I'm so sorry. - Gosh... - Sheesh. I'm so sorry, sir. - A ball came out of nowhere. - Are you hurt at all? No, I'm fine. - Are you okay? - I'm just... Hang on. - Is this 91 1? - But I'm fine, sir. I was just in a car accident. I swear, I think my spine popped out of my back and... Oh my god, I think I'm dying... - Come to the intersection on... - What are you doing? - Please, come quick! - Why are you doing this? What a bad day... - Hello. - Yes, hello. - I'll be with you soon. - Sure. Pardon? What? Oh. Nothing. Excuse me... Everybody freeze! Move, and you die! Don't look up! We're busy people here! - I said, don't move! - Freeze! - What is with today, goddamn it! - Keep your head down! Hurry up! Move! Get all the money! Excuse me. Shouldn't you do something? You're a cop. I'm just traffic police. Don't traffic police get any training? This wasn't in our training program. Be quiet! Don't try to be a hero! Excuse me... Don't worry so much. They'll leave as soon as they get the money. What are you doing? You seemed so frightened, so I wanted to help you feel better. I'm sorry. Mister! What are you staring at? No... I didn't! I didn't stare! - You pervert! - What? - I'm disgusted! - Quiet down! So she was sexually harassed during the robbery... - It's a misunderstanding! - A misunderstanding? You were exploiting me and blowing into my ear! - Like this! - No, I didn't! I was just breathing because I was talking to you! - I was just breathing! - No one breathes that heavily! You blew into my ear and stared at my breasts! Her breasts? Detective! This is all wrong, sir! We'll see what the evidence says. - Why were you at the bank? - Huh? Well... I got a loan for a house to live in after I get married. You're even engaged? Fine, then. Give me your fiance's number. - I can't reach her right now. - Why not? She just suddenly disappeared. Of course she ran away from this pervert. - That's not what happened, lady! - You called me lady? I'm not some old lady! I wasn't gonna say this because it was too humiliating, but this man even grabbed my breasts! What? I would've let you off easy, - but this is ridiculous! - I didn't touch her! This is unbelievable! Excuse me, Detective Kim. Yes? - The way I see it... - Go on and tell me. - Did he grab the lady's butt, too? - Don't call me lady! Well, after seeing everything that happened, I don't think it was sexual harassment. You see? She says I didn't do it! - Are you sure? - Yes, the way I see it, he was actually trying to protect this woman. My goodness! What are you talking about? Excuse me! Thank you so much for earlier. You stopped them from making me a pervert. I just said what I saw. Still, thank you so much. Right. Okay. - All right, then. - Okay. Bye. - Ae-yeon! - You scared me! Who's Prince Charming? - It's a long story. - Huh? Wanna get a drink after work? You're buying. I'm broke these days. No problem. You go ahead. I have to stop by home first. What about your husband? - I've got him on a leash. - Lucky bitch. I keep telling you. Get over that bastard and find someone new. - I'm already working on it. - You are? Is it that Prince Charming? Ae-yeon! It's been one heck of a day. Yeah. I don't think I should go. Would you look at that? I even left the bathroom lights on. I'm just gonna lay low at home. Give me a call when you close up. All right. Thanks a lot. The culprits raided the bank at approximately 2PM. They threatened people with handguns. They got it on tape. ...escaped with over 500 thousand dollars. The robbery lasted only five minutes. Hello? Yes. Oh, the taxi driver! Yes, sir. I'm very sorry about earlier... Excuse me? Why did you get an MRI done, sir? You're not even that hurt. Please, why don't I... I'll give you 300 dollars, so let's... What? You're suing me? Look here, sir! Hello? Hello? What kind of a man... This is the worst day ever. A thousand dollars? Goddamn it. Let's settle for 500, sir. - Yoo-seok. - Bok-nam? What's up? - Did you find her? - Yeah. Are you serious? Where was she? - Can you meet me now? - Speak up. I can't hear you! I'm with Na-ri right now. My wallet... Just trust me, sweetie. Oh! I'm sorry. - It's okay. - Sorry. They just can't stay apart... I should've just cuffed them together. Diamonds last forever, and so will our love. I'm not hung up on him. So long. Wow. - It's worth two or three, at least. - What? - Really? - Outstanding cut and sparkle. Never seen such a well-made cubic. Cubic? Then it's two or three... - Dollars! - Dollars... That asshole. He said it was real! - You made me wait for an hour! - I'm sorry, okay? Where's Na-ri? Huh? - You said you were with her. - She didn't want to see you. You should've brought her anyway. - Yoo-seok. - Yeah? - Damn it. - Goddamn it. - Just forget about her. - What's that supposed to mean? She's getting married. - She's moving overseas soon. - What? You know ''street smart'' is my middle name, right? I'm telling you, she's gone. Just forget about her. Okay? - Excuse me. - Yes. Drink up. Their rice wine is amazing. - Can we get a tofu plate, please? - Sure. - What was her reason? - She just doesn't like you. - But shouldn't I at least meet her? - You idiot. I told you she wasn't good from the very start. Come on. Let's find you a better woman, okay? You've been looking in the wrong places. Let's look for one now. There's plenty of good women. Look around you. So many beautiful... We'll look somewhere else. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. What's going on today? He's gonna think I'm pathetic. What's taking her so long? Oh! I'm sorry. - It's okay. - Sorry. They stole a cop's wallet? Crap. Where are you? At home. Where else? - Oh, right! Drinks! - Get over here, right now. But I can't exactly go out right now. It's just that something came up. (Hang up the phone.) Yeah. You're going out, eh? I'm so sorry, Ae-yeon. The in-laws suddenly came over. I'm coming, Mother! Enjoy your passionate night with the in-laws. Thank you. What's taking him so long? Hello? Are you taking a number two? - Hey, something just came up. -You left? - How could you just leave? - It's not like that. I don't have any money! - I left my wallet at home! - Then put it on a tab. - Are you kidding me? Get over here! - Talk up a girl into paying for you! - I have to go. - What? Hello? That bastard... Goddamn it. What do I do? One... One fifty... I can't believe this. What should I do? - Yes, hello. - Hi... What do I do... What do I do? - Bok-nam, that bastard. - Think, Ae-yeon. Think. Use your head. Screw it. Hello. - We meet again. - Right. - Is this seat taken? - Go ahead. Sorry to bother you. - You're here by yourself... - Oh, no. - My friend suddenly couldn't make it. - Oh. I see. - Would you like a drink? - Yes. Thank you. Stop right there. Boink! - Cheers. - Right. Yes... So... You look much better out of uniform. Not that you look bad in uniform or anything. You're very pretty in uniform and in regular clothes. That's what I meant to say. - The thing is... - Yes? - Something's come up at home. - Oh. - Why don't we call it a night? - Shall we? - Yes. - Sure. Should I combine your bills? Yes, please. That'll be seventy-three dollars. Who will be paying? - She will. - He will. Excuse us. Hey... I never do this. I swear. But couldn't I treat you next time? You can treat me now. Now? The truth is... I didn't bring my wallet. I'm really sorry. What? But I lost my wallet. What? What is this? He'll be back tomorrow for it with the money, right? Yes, of course. I'm so sorry. - I'll be back for it tomorrow. - Is this real? Hey! You think it's some kind of two, three dollar cubic? My mother gave me that. - I'm a cop. You don't trust cops? - That's right. - She's really a cop. - All right. Fine. Hey... I'm really sorry. No, I'm sorry too. Which way is your house? - I'm over by Yeonsinnae. - Oh, that's pretty far. So... How should I get you back that ring? Should we meet here tomorrow? - Or should I wire the money? - No, that's... Then... Let's meet here around this time tomorrow. - Good night, then. - Okay. Excuse me. Yes? - My goodness! Are you okay? - Aw, crap. It's so cold. - Are you all right? - Yes... I'm fine. Gosh, it's cold. - You didn't have to do that. - No, it's okay. - Are you sure? - Yes. Gosh... Are you okay? I don't think I'm okay. Hey! Excuse me! Sheesh. Would you like to wash up at my place? Huh? You're soaking wet. And you don't have any cab fare. You said you lost your wallet. So she left you with just a text message... - And you've been looking for her since? - Yes. And you even got a loan to buy a house in this economy, when everyone's dying to sell? That's right. Real estate prices keep dropping now. I was out of my mind. I didn't know there were still nice guys like you, Mister. Mister? I'm not that old... What do you do? I have a small teashop. Herbal teas and such. - I love herbal teas. - Oh. - What kind of tea? - I like lemongrass. - I love the aroma. - I see. You know your teas. I drink lots of tea because I don't like coffee. - You don't like coffee? - No. Neither do I. That's why we don't sell coffee at our shop. - Really? - Yes. - You're left-handed? - Yes. Supposedly, I was a very stubborn child. My mother kept telling me to use my right hand, but I always used my left. Being left-handed doesn't mean you're stubborn. I'm left-handed too. - You are? - Yes. I see. - What's in that big bag of yours? - Oh, this? - I have to dry clean my uniform. - Oh. - Isn't it heavy? Put it on here. - No, no. It's not heavy. It's comfortable this way. I see. Sorry. What's your name, Mister? Oh. I'm KIM Yoo-seok. And don't call me ''Mister''. - You're not gonna ask me my name? - Oh! What's your name? I'm CHOI Ae-yeon. Officer CHOI. I see. Nice to meet you. Come in. Wow! A vegetable garden! Lettuce. Chili peppers. Chicory. And cherry tomatoes! That soil, it's really good organic fertilizer from worm compost. I see. - Come on in. - Right. I was in such a hurry, I forgot the lights. It's a bit of a mess. I'm not done organizing. No, it's really nice. Wow. Huh? You take pictures, too? - I majored in photography originally. - Oh. - Where was this? - That's Africa. I used to go there every year to take pictures. But with the cafe, I haven't been for a few years. Wow. So this is her? - The woman who let luck get away? - Yes... The floor is pretty cold. I'll get you some slippers. Slippers... You sure are lucky. They're not here. Maybe inside the room... - Here they are. - Right. - Here. - Thank you. - Put them on. - I'll do it. Thank you. Your clothes... Something in here should fit you. You may as well just change. - Sorry for all the trouble. - Don't mention it. - What are all these boxes? - Those are Na-ri's... She said she'd send someone for her things. A woman that ran away won't come back for this. Just sell what you can and throw away the rest. Those cheating assholes don't care about the ones they hurt, so... - I'm sorry. That was out of line. - It's okay. You're right. She's getting married to another man. I'm a fool, aren't I? You know... You're pretty cute, Mister. I keep telling you I'm not that old. You should wash up. I'll turn on the hot water for you. - Get changed. - Okay. Yes? There's no need to hurry. Take your time. Okay. - Would you like some lemongrass tea? - Later... - After I take a shower. - Sure. Who is it? Na-ri... How have you been? You haven't changed a bit. Can I come in? I just need to get something. Hey, wait... - Can't you come back tomorrow? - What? - Don't kid around, honey. - No, it's just... Now is not a good time. Come back tomorrow, okay? I'll explain everything inside, honey. - I'm sort of busy today. - Come on. It's okay. - You have a visitor. - Yeah... I think I should go. No, you don't... You can't do whatever you want. Showing up here without even saying sorry... It doesn't concern you. Or does it? No, it doesn't. I was out of line. Oh. Sorry for the trouble. I'll just get some things and go. - Na-ri. - Yeah? You show up after two months and this is it? What? I was with another woman. Don't you even care? Should I congratulate you? Do you... Do you know how worried I was? I couldn't sleep, and you just show up now... Doesn't... Doesn't anything matter to you? I'm sorry, Yoo-seok. I know I can't apologize enough, but I'm sorry. This isn't working out. I can't do it anymore. Take what you need. I'm throwing the rest out. Take care of yourself. Ae-yeon! Ae-yeon! Wait! What is it? Well... You don't have any money. - Oh, right. - Yes. Good thing I caught up to you. - Thank you. - Sure. We're still meeting tomorrow? Wait! Stop! What the hell is wrong with you? It's you again! You're dead. - A lousy 300 bucks, eh? - Wait... I got a diagnosis printed out, asshole. You're out on your ass. - Hold on. - What the heck? I'll pay you as much as you want. Let me talk to your customer first. You're serious? - If this is a joke, you're dead! - Of course not. Fine. Oh no. - He's coming. He's coming. Excuse me. Could I maybe get your number? Your fiance is back. Yes. I know. I know none of this makes sense. I wouldn't believe it either. But it sort of does make sense... I know I might sound crazy, but I just ended things with her. I'm not trying to cheat on one woman with another. But still... Seeing her made me realize that I was only hanging on. Gosh, I feel sick. I know we've been through some bad things today. Maybe fate... Okay, let's forget about all that fate and destiny crap. I just know that if I let you go like this, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. That's why I'm here. Okay? - Sir. - Huh? - Give me a pen and paper. - What? - Pen and some paper! - Right. Okay. Please call me. We can meet again and if you don't think it'll work, you can turn me down then. Take the paper already. It's just a phone number. It's not like it'll cost you. Thank you. Please give me a call tomorrow. - Thank you, sir. - Yeah. - Keep your promise. - All right. This is so embarrassing. Why? I think this is great. That's because it didn't happen to you. My aunt forced me to go on the blind date. I'm sorry, but... - You're not my type - Excuse me? I get that you're rich and all, but that's what I should be saying! - Still, you're just not my type - Neither are you. The nerve... My goodness My hands are trembling - But I'll still pay for these. - How rude! Don't worry so much. Okay. I got it Oh my god! He's been after me since, saying he'll take responsibility. - I'm your knight in shining armor. - Sure. Knight... You don't want to marry me? Come on, honey. I'm just kidding. - You are, right? - Sure. The back alleys of this city reek with a foul stench. I should be used to it by now. But the merciless violence of the night... Sometimes it's too much for me to bear. Ah If only I could have turned him down. I shouldn't have agreed to do this. Be honest. Why are you looking for her? - Does she owe you money? - It's not like that. She disappeared Aren't you even curious? I would've said no, if we weren't childhood friends. If he weren't the last pure soul left in this filthy city I would've said no. HWANG Na-ri. It's just like Hansel and Gretel. I see all the crumbs she leaves behind. None other than... Her cell phone. Women don't change hair salons easily. HWANG Na-ri comes here regularly. Ow! Gotcha. I told you so. I soon discovered her shocking identity. She was a gold digger. It was just shocking that she always used her real name. I should've seen it back then The first time saw her. But I let myself down. Say hello. Bok-nam is my best friend and Na-ri is my girlfriend. Nice to meet you. And... This man... - Hello? - You said a week. - Are you lazy, or just bad? - I know. I'm close to finding her. I'll have good news soon. Come on. You've been saying that for two months, Bok-nam. - Is your detective agency legit? - I'm lying to my friend right now. I don't really know why. Sorry I'm late. - What's with you? - Nothing. Let's eat. What is this that I'm feeling? Maybe... Never mind. I need to investigate this further. Like I told you, I almost found her. I'm sort of busy right now, so... Give it some time, okay? I'll take care of... Oh my god! I'm sorry. You might want to cover the back. Shit. Shit. Ow! - Ma'am. - Huh? Is something the matter? No, it's just... - Do you have the car keys? - Yes, ma'am. Right here. Silly me. I left something back at the office. I'll drive you there, ma'am. Here. You really don't have to. You're working so hard. - It's nothing, ma'am. - Wait! All this work is ruining your skin tone! Here. It's a health drink. Thank you, ma'am. It's an honor. Drink up. You're so adorable. So, where should I take... He even put his belt on! What the... What is she doing Holy shit! You stole money from LEE Byung-chan? That's his money? Huh? Bok-nam? I'm asking you if that's LEE's money! Why are you in my house? Yoo-seok might kill himself if I don't find you! You're really a private eye? That's not the problem right now, woman! Of all the money out there, you stole from LEE Byung-chan? Don't you know who he is? What kind of gold digger steals without doing research Who says? Who says I'm a gold digger? I do. You wanna know all the dirt I have on you? Forget it. Do you know how scary he is? No one betrayed him and lived to tell about it! He buries bodies for breakfast! Last week, he tore down a restaurant just for the heck of it! He's a filthy bastard! I'll hide out for a few months. How would they find me? Do you know how I found you? Fucking easily. Shit! - What are you waiting for? - I'm sorry, sir! Oh my god... It's me, sir. Piece of cake, eh? We would've been buried alive if we were a minute late! I think I'm gonna wet my pants. Oh my god... What do I do? Just give back the money and beg for your life! I'm too scared. - This is so scary! - Should've thought of that before. Hey... Couldn't you take it to them for me, Bok-nam? Me? Are you nuts? Why should I? What am I, nuts? I didn't do this because I wanted to. I'm an orphan. But I have to live too. I can't just kill myself. That's why I did it. Your father seemed well. You should call him. That's right But my mother is sick. She needs money for surgery and... Your mom said you're dead if she ever catches you. One grand, okay? A thousand dollars for one little delivery is a lot. - What is this, Chinese delivery? - Two thousand, then. Deal? You wanna play hardball, eh? Then how much? I don't want to seem easy. And I'm more afraid she'll realize how I feel. - Five thousand. - Five thousand? For a one-minute errand? Wow. That's just unethical. I'm putting my life on the line. Forget it, then. Fine. Five thousand it is. Deal! Shit. - We have to stop by somewhere first. - Where? - Yoo-seok's place. - What for? To get my passport. I need a way out if this plan busts, don't I? Moron. Goddamn it. Is it really that urgent? Just unzip yourself and let it out. It's about to burst... He didn't change the password. You idiot! What's wrong with you? I was just trying to calm your nerves. Hurry up. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Huh? It's been one heck of a day. Yeah. I don't think I should go. - Shit. - Would you look at that? I even left the bathroom lights on. I'm just gonna lay low at home. Give me a call when you close up. All right. Thanks a lot. The culprits raided the bank at approximately 2PM. - They threatened people... - They got it on tape. The robbers escaped with over 500 thousand dollars. The robbery lasted only five minutes. They pointed guns at us... - Hello? - Everyone was tied up and... - They seemed to have planned it... - Yes, the taxi driver! I'm very sorry about earlier... Excuse me? Why did you get an MRI done, sir? - You're not even that hurt. - It hurts. It hurts so bad. I'll give you 300 dollars, so let's... What? You're suing me Look here, sir! Hello? Hello? What kind of a man... This is the worst day ever! A thousand dollars? Never mind that. Just pick up. - Let's settle for 500, sir. - Yoo-seok. - Bok-nam? - Yeah. - What's up? Did you find her? - Yeah. Are you serious? Where was she? Can you meet me now? Let's meet now. - Speak up. I can't hear you! - I'm with Na-ri right now. Five thousand. Okay. The money is all there. Give me your passport. - What for? - Because I don't trust you. - I'll give it back once we're done. - Cheap bastard. Fine. Take it. Be back in five minutes. Or else I'm gonna bail without my passport. Moron. My heart is actually at ease. Even though I'm walking into the fiery depths of hell. Being able to be this relaxed, even in grave danger... That is who I am. PARK Bok-nam! What's this? Hey... You. Curly. What are you doing here? Package delivery, sir. Sheesh. - De... Delivery, eh? - Delivery, sir! - How... How much is it? - About ten dollars. About ten dollars? One moment, please. - You're so nervous. - No, I'm not. Woah... Wait.Here... Ten dollars? We're not expecting anything. Hey, you! Who the hell are you? You little bastard! Stop right there! Shit! Come back here! I'll give you ten dollars! Curly! What? What's wrong? They almost stabbed me! Sheesh. Curly! Drive! I guess it's all over now. I guess so. Yoo-seok is waiting at a bar we often went to. Want to stop by and see him? Seeing me will make it harder for him. - I'll just go. - Okay. Can I ask you something? Was there even a moment when you really liked him? Of course I liked him. - What about LEE Byung-chan? - I was crazy about him. I would've married him if he weren't a mobster. I feel a migraine coming on. You're one strange woman. Can I ask you something too? Uh-huh. You said you found me a long time ago. Then why haven't you told Yoo-seok? I didn't want him to get hurt. Imagine him realizing you're a gold digger. - He thinks you have a heart of gold. - I see. You didn't have any other motives? I just thought... Maybe you liked me. I'm very picky about women. Hilarious. Never mind, then. - I'm going. - Okay. Where is this? Bye. Take care of yourself. Farewell, my femme fatale. - You made me wait for an hour! - I'm sorry, okay? - But shouldn't I at least meet her? - Just end it, nice and clean. I told you she wasn't good from the very start. Let's find you a better woman, okay? I'm gonna go to the bathroom. - You little rat. - Here, kitty. - There you are. - What are you doing here? Lose the glasses, asshole. Strip. - What? - Take off your clothes, bitch! Right now. Should we do it? Did you get the package all right? - I didn't touch it. I swear. - Kneel. Answer it. - Huh? - Answer the damn phone! Say anything funny and I'll bury you alive. Just one minute. - Hello? - Are you taking a number two? - Hey, something just came up... - You left? - It's not like that, man. - How could you leave? I don't have any money. - I left my wallet at home! - Then put it on a tab. Are you kidding me? Get over here! - Talk some girl into paying for you! - Huh? I have to go! Good boy. Huh? - Is this him? - Yes, sir. - You delivered this? - Yes, I did... Open it. It's true that I wanted to keep it for myself. But I was sure this package was more suitable for you, sir... Explain this situation to me. There's a girl named HWANG Na-ri... HWANG Na-ri, that little bitch! Can't you go any faster, sir? Did we really have to wear these matching shirts? - A carrot! What am I, a horse? - I paid for it all. We used to be just friends, but she made a move on me. - Hey. - What is it? - Let's start dating. - Are you drunk? You can't tell what's what? Life is short and love takes time. So just go out with me. I had no intention of dating her, you hear? - But then... - A miracle happened! What's wrong? Are you choking? Dang it. What did I tell you? I told you to stop stuffing your damn face! Huh? I saw an angel that day. - A real live angel. - Honey. - There's people here. - Who cares? - What do you want more than anything? - I don't know! Let me see! Okay. One! - Two! Three! - Ta-da! Ta-da! What do you think? I put in all my money to buy this house for us! Huh? - All your money? - That's right. I surprised you, didn't I! Na-ri! This is our home! Wow! - I'm going to the restroom. - Okay. There's no reason, really. Yoo-seok is a great guy, but he's just not for me. I really wanted to make it work this time... People call me a gold digger, but... I'm just looking for a man I can love. A man I can love who can love me back. But why do I feel bad? It's not like I sinned... That's right. - Are you all right? - Yes, thank you. This must be fate. I can feel it. You're not hurt? He's the one. He's the man I've been waiting for. And he's even left-handed! He's kind. Polite. And even romantic! My dreams are finally coming true! Then, I found out what he did for a living. Welcome back, boss! My dream shattered to pieces. - Ma'am! - Na-ri! - I was sure that one day, - Na-ri! Wake up! I told you not to bow! this man would surely kill me. Shit. Come on, Sang-du. Can't you wrap it up nicely? - Yes, sir. - Come, now. Don't call me ''sir''. - But that would be absurd, sir. - We're practically brothers. Still... Then I guess... Bro. Let's make it Mr. LEE. Yes, sir. Mr. LEE. I was thinking about how bad the economy is these days. Why don't we look into a different business? What? It better not be collecting art again. Real estate, funds, stocks, and bonds. There are other options for capital now. Market prices are always decided by the owner, and they can't be taxed on the sale of the artwork. That's why I've prepared this for you, sir. What is that? The universe. And Earth. - Says who? - The art dealer. And you paid 100 grand for this. - And now you want me to buy it? - Huh? Then what's that? The moon? A full moon. You fucking idiot! Sheesh. No, no. Definitely not art. You're here! And you're early. - Hello, ma'am. - There was no traffic. Oh, right. I'm sorry, Na-ri. I don't usually do this myself, but I had to take care of some things today. You look busy, honey. Should I wait outside? No, no. I'm all done. Should we go eat something nice? Sure. I'm telling you. He just ripped the wig right off of my head. In front of all those people? Yeah, because of some goddamn inspection. Oh my! My goodness! - So what happened next? - I was completely humiliated. Dang it. Lookee here. Be a bit more careful, you hear? What? What are you staring at me for, eh? - Let it go. - Honey, just let it go. Hold on. - I apologize. - Damn right. Goddamn... - Where was I? - Humiliated... Right. Humiliated. I got humiliated and made a damn fool. Boss. I told you not to call me that. How did it go? Holy mother fuck! That goddamn little cunt! And you let that prick say that? Go tell him to stop barking up the wrong tree! Or I'll go and snap him in two, you hear? - I don't understand you, sir. - Come here. Yes, sir. Ask Mr. KIM for ten percent off on the floor tiles. - You hear? - Yes, sir! Save the black suits for funerals, kid. - Hello? - You said a week. Is it that you're lazy, or just bad? I'm close to finding her. - I'll have good news soon. - You've said that for two months. I'm okay. What's wrong? Are you choking? Dang it. What did I tell you? - Stop stuffing your darn face! - Just wait a little more. Huh? Are you okay? Snap out of it! Give it some time, okay? Oh my god! You might want to cover the back. Why is it so crazy in here? Holy! Yay! Vitamin C! You look tired. - I'm really, really tired. - Oh. Vitamin cocktail! Cheers. Vitamin C? Wow. Vitamin C. - I'm gonna go to the restroom. - Sure. Go ahead. It's me, sir. - Did you find her? - I'm sorry, sir. The car is still here, but she's... All right. - Please kill me, sir. - Right now? Forget it. I was just as stupid, letting her drug me... Did you get diarrhea too? I went eight times... I'm fine, sir! My asshole is on fire. - Good afternoon. - Yes, you too. Why are you so loud? You'd think there was a war in here! My neighbor called the cops after seeing you thugs. - Keep it down! - We're not thugs. You're making a mess! This is what demolishing is. Relieves stress that way. You're giving me a half off deal, okay? Oh my, my... Half off leaves us with nothing, ma'am. - Don't just buy us drinks like last time! - Whatever! I can't hear you! LEE Byung-chan is my name. I, too, had my golden days. I was what the world calls ''a thug''. I was once as successful as anyone. I used to enjoy life more than anyone. I once did more terrible things than anyone. But there was never a time when I did any good. It all meant nothing. Nothing could fill the hole in my heart. Not until I met her. Could this be happiness? I wanted to change my life. Live a decent life. For this one woman, more than anything. But that hope was destroyed. Shattered to pieces in a single moment. I have to stay calm. Where could she be hiding? Ow... Where? You have to find that briefcase. You know what happens if you don't, right? I know, sir. - We got a package, sir. - A package? Where is it, moron? Hey, you! Who the hell are you? - Shit! - Stop right there! Curly! Put your seatbelt on! Hey! Farewell, my femme fatale. - Hello? - Yes, hello? I know where your thief is. Na-ri? It's you! How did he know? - I'm not Na-ri. - You're Na-ri! Let's meet and talk this over. I told you, I'm not Na-ri! Fine. You're not. Let's still meet. Explain this situation to me. HWANG Na-ri, that little bitch! Can't you go any faster, sir? Mister! - Shit! - Mister? Why am I getting all this shit today? So you're saying, Na-ri stashed the money at your friend's house, and she's probably on her way to get it now? - And she's framing you for it? - That's right, sir. How much longer? You said five minutes! - Mister! - Let me concentrate. - I'm asking you how long! - Goddamn it! It'll take as long as it's gonna take! It won't go up with you weighing it down. Either get out and wait, or just go! Now you tell me? Fine. Fine, then! I'm leaving and I'm not paying for the ride! Couldn't you pay me a little? She only left you a text message, but you've been waiting for her? - Yes. - And you got a loan, - What do I do? - to buy a house in this economy, - when everyone's dying to sell? - Prices keep dropping now. - I was out of my mind. - Wow. I didn't know there were still nice guys like you, Mister. Mister? I'm not that old... It's that room over there. Go park the car somewhere else. Yes, sir. I guess you don't need me anymore. Strip this idiot down and stick him in the back. Yes, sir. Not the clothes again... I'm useless to you now, sir... - Come on in. - Right. I was in such a hurry, I forgot the lights. It's a mess. I'm not done organizing. No, it's really nice. - You take pictures, too? - Yes. - I majored in photography originally. - Oh. The floor is pretty cold. I'll get you some slippers. Here they are! - Put them on. - I'll do it. Thank you. Something here should fit you. You may as well just change. - What are all these boxes? - Those are Na-ri's... She's getting married to another man. You should wash up. I'll turn on the hot water. - Get changed. - Thank you. Yes? There's no need to hurry. Take your time. Okay. Would you like some lemongrass tea? Later... After I take a shower. Sure. You can't suddenly raise the deposit... Thirty thousand dollars doesn't grow on trees! Who is it? Na-ri... Can't you come back tomorrow? I'll explain everything inside, honey. I'm sort of busy today. Come back tomorrow. Come on. - I'm sorry, Yoo-seok. - Take what you need. I'm throwing the rest out tomorrow. Take care of yourself. Ae-yeon! - Yoo-seok! - Shut up! Huh? What the... It was right here... Holy shit! Honey... Honey, listen... Listen to me, okay? He planned all of it. He made me do it. I had no other choice. Seriously! I had no other choice, honey. You believe me, don't you? Na-ri. It wasn't me, honey! I swear! You have to believe me! - Let's go. - Huh? Let's go home. What are you saying, honey? I'll give you back the money! That's why I came here! You think I came here for the lousy money? I came to find you. HWANG Na-ri. Why? Do I have to have a reason to find you? Because everyone calls you a gold digger? I already knew. Long ago. So what? Like I'm anything special? Me? I used to be a thug. I'm no different from... But the most important thing is... I can't live without you. Let's go, Na-ri. We'll go home and... Let's start again from the beginning. But you're just so scary... Come on. I'm not a thug anymore. I knew you hated it, so I quit. I'm not a thug anymore. I was so scared. I thought you'd kill me. I was so scared that you'd kill me! How could I do something like that to you? I really liked you too... Come here. Okay, now it's getting annoying. Stop crying. Please. Give me a call. Give me a call tomorrow. Are you gonna call him? He's got some spunk for a nerd. Oh, right! What about the money? Did you get the money, honey? Of course. It's safe in the trunk. Are you having regrets? Of course not. Sang-du. Do we really have to put on this show for the boys? Loyalty isn't what it used to be, sir. They only follow the smell of money. We'll make these, then just let them get a whiff. - It'll be a done deal. - I never thought I'd be doing this. Holy shit! Is that you, Bok-nam? Yoo-seok... So many horrible things happened to me today. I thought I was gonna die! What's gotten into you? What the... What are you doing? Checking for any text messages. No woman would text a man this early. Don't you know anything about the female mind? They'll turn you down, then once more for good measure. But she'll call once, right? She even met Na-ri? That's one hell of a mess you're in. Why would she call? What are you doing? I'm not gonna keep getting bullied around. I'm hungry. How about breakfast? That was short. Go cook it yourself. I'm throwing out Na-ri's things. - Really? - Yeah, I'm throwing it all out. Ae-yeon. Hello. Yes, hello. I don't know where to begin. So many things happened that day. A car accident. A bank robbery. Ae-yeon lost her wallet. - And there was the fake money... - You're mentioning that, too? - Why not? It's all in the past. - Still... I'm embarrassed. You are? Then... What should I talk about? Should I do it? Well... Yoo-seok thinks the bank was where we first met. But... The truth is... I'm sorry. Take care. I was so sad, I wanted to die... Until he walked over to me. This is lemongrass tea. It has a nice aroma. Enjoy it. It's on the house. I only saw his back the first time. Then I saw him from the side. And I saw him hurting, too. Look over there, Ae-eyon. That guy was ditched. I've been watching for a while. The woman won't come back. I know him... Thirty thousand doesn't grow on trees! Anyway, I'm at work right now. I'll call you later. Okay. - He wants thirty thousand more? - Yeah. He's being so greedy! What will you do? I have to move out otherwise. I'll go to the bank and ask about some loans. Everybody freeze! Move, and you die! What is with today? Excuse me. You stole my money! It was just a dream. What should I do? I'm nuts! How could a cop steal from someone? I'm hopeless! How do I give it back? Package delivery? Ae-yeon. Hello. Yes, hello. - What brings you here? - I... I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to, but I just... - What do you mean? - Huh? Is there something wrong? You should've called. Was it the wrong number? It won't go through? No, that's not it. I made a mistake and I... I have something to give back to you. - Are you talking about the cab fare? - No, that's not it... - Why don't you come in for some tea? - Pardon? Come on in. My friend is over. Bok-nam! Hey. Put your clothes on! - You should've given me a head's up! - I'm so sorry, Ae-yeon. You idiot! - That hurts! - Hurry up! - Sorry. - I'm so sorry. - I'll be right back with the tea. - Sure. - Get out here! - All right! Sorry again. I'm really into exercising these days. Hey, who is she? The woman I met yesterday. Ae-yeon. - Seriously? - Look. Wow. - Isn't she pretty? - She's pretty. We're really happy together. Go to church often. We're getting married soon. She's a little late. That's her one fault, if any. My sweet Na-ri. She's not picking up again. Maybe she's driving. You shouldn't answer when you're driving. My sweet Na-ri... We're gonna have to reschedule this interview. She's disappeared again. She's a free spirit. Likes to travel... Let's do this next time. What are you waiting for? Send the boys after her! What do I have to do to keep her in one place? Put her in a straight-jacket? Should I call an exorcist? Goddamn it, HWANG Na-ri! ''Translated by Stefanie Y. Hong''
