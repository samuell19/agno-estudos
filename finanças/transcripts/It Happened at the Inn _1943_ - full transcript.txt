This film was restored by PATH? in 2015 and was awarded the Grand Prix Du Cin?ma Fran?ais in 1944 by the Soci?t? des Auteurs Dramatiques GOUPI RED HANDS Evening, Ma. Thanks, Marie. Your chicory and your paper. - And my shoes? - Next week. - Your son-in-law comes tonight? - 8:50. - Husband didn't fetch him? - The Mouth! - What? - Change for 100. Moneybags... you should have fetched Monsieur. - Who'd run the inn? - Me. You? You're a chatterbox! We'd have closed. Not during a parade rehearsal. They'd have gone elsewhere. Moneybags, the lights! Better. You don't pay the bills, Eus?be. Evening, Moneybags. 9 francs, 10 sous. 5, 15. And 2 sous, 2 more... and 1 more. And 90. A debt paid is a friend kept, your brother says. Give us a bottle. - Not to kick you out... - But you are. Monsieur is coming from Paris. - Monsieur? - His son. Excuse me. How old is he now? 27. Got a good job in Paris. - When did you see him last? - 25 years ago. Red Hands is picking him up. Tell me... Have you seen anyone? No one waiting for me? We never see a soul here. Excuse me... Sir, I was expecting someone to take me to the Goupis. They're my family. Are they far? No, just 8 miles. Have your ticket? 8 miles? Wonderful... Paris? What's going on in Paris? See for yourself. It's only 385 miles. No one. Unbelievable... Monsieur? Eug?ne Goupi, yes. Are you the houseboy? Your uncle L?opold. And I don't like the looks of you. Let's get going. We're not going to walk there. It would do you good but I brought Alberte. Alberte? Yes, your father's mare. Your suitcase. Are you getting on? ?mile, take your money. Right amount? Not a cent more. Or less. It's what you're owed. Now Louis. Six days... 25 francs a day... 146 francs. I'd love a sip of red with a biscuit. No is no. So we said 146 francs. Here you go... Excuse me, boss, but 6 times 25 is 150. And the wine you owe Moneybags? Short memory. Don't be late tomorrow. Goodnight, everyone. Bellyache, Tincture? If not my belly, my kidneys. If not my kidneys... Emperor! No spitting on the floor! Where then? When I was a kid, we spat where we wanted. Germs hadn't been invented yet. - And the calf? - I left Jean. - It's like leaving no one. - Of course. I speak my mind. I'm fed up with you and your lazy son! Lily of the Valley... the calf and Monsieur will arrive together. Odd outfit, Monsieur. In Paris, they'd say the same of you. Why "Monsieur", Uncle L?opold? Because you're a gentleman living in Paris. I'm Red Hands. Get used to it if you're staying. Staying? Why did my father even send for me? After 25 years! I'm not the messenger boy. They won't be long. - What time is it? - 9. - Emperor should be in bed. - And you? - Waiting for your great-grandson. - Who? He's doing it on purpose. - Evening... - Hello, Minain. I brought you the 10,000 for the poplars. No rush. A rich man pays his debts, says Dictum. You can check. I trust you. A real bargain. We have fine poplars. Well, they're not made of oak. Are your banknotes gold? Here's your receipt. No need with the Goupis. Still going strong. Bit weaker. At 106, that can be forgiven. Good evening. Goodbye, Minain. Take care, Emperor! Give that to me! Money is not a game! No fun not having any. Hello, Grandfather. Good job, Lawman! Don't mention it. - Why? - My gun isn't adjusted right. Shoot a hare and a partridge falls down. The carpenter brought the 10,000. In the armoire. Did he now? Not nice for others. Afraid I'll give you germs? You have them all. Has Monsieur arrived? - Not yet. - And the calf? Nope. Strange that he's not here. I mean my son. It's only normal. We sent Red Hands. You should have gone, Moneybags. Just to be polite. But your customers... Blabber on! Why did I remarry? - What's that for? - Suicide. To think my father skipped my mother's funeral. She wasn't a Goupi. Not right for Moneybags. Moneybags? Your father. He married my sister The Mouth. A real one. - A real what? - A real Goupi. You like nicknames. "Monsieur" suits you! And does "Red Hands" suit you? You be the judge. Giddy up, Alberte! Still much further? Not much. 4 more miles. Like the scenery? Pretty gloomy. What's got into her? Giddy up! This is all I needed! What is it now? What is it? - The axle is stuck. - What do we do? I have a shack. We'll spend the night. - They'll worry. - Why? They know you're safe. What do you mean? You're with me. Yes, of course. Get your suitcase and follow me. My private property. A bit remote. That's why I chose it. Come... Coming in? Leave that there. Strange place. I've had enough of being with others. Some prefer working in fields. I prefer woods, rivers. Have a seat. I hope you're hungry. Trips do that. Mine cut my appetite. What's that? This? Alfred Bonnaud, our Justice of the Peace. What? His right eye has closed. No big deal. Only if the left follows suite. Going blind is bothersome. The clear-sighted aren't spared. Do you cast spells? Spells are for old wives' tales. I'm a sculptor. The artist of the family. - And who is that? - This? The butcher. The butcher's tooth. Nice guy, but can't hold his tongue. So he has a sore throat, of late. If he talked less, it might improve. What does all of this mean, Uncle? My dog. He must smell that ghost again. What ghost? Hers. She died? Pretty, isn't she? I'll show you. What? The ghost? No, the well she jumped into. Coming? The well she died in. Louison. So beautiful we called her Goupi La Belle. She was 19. I was 22. Some girls kill themselves for a hopeless love. Careful, Monsieur! 75 feet deep. Accidents happen. Go back. Drink, eat, sleep. I have to go in the woods. This late at night? To meet the Devil. It's you! - He left? - Ran off like a zebra. Good old Monsieur. - Scared as hell. - I'll say! He had me laughing the whole way! He'll end up hating his birthplace. He still may stay and marry Lily. I doubt it. If her father gave me her hand, I'd do anything, even become serious. Relax, Tonkin. I'd even work the Goupi land for her. And yet... I breathe more freely in the colonies. You love Lily or the colonies? So I'll tend to it. Follow Monsieur. Fear may make him act foolishly. I'll bring the cart back. - See you on the road? - Right. The colonies. He's late. I hope the train didn't derail. And my mare is all right. It's getting worrisome. I'd love a drop of red wine with a biscuit. - No red wine, Father. - No, surely not. I remember once after the revolution, in Aubeterre... It had a different name then... L?on-Le-Franc. L?on-Le-Franc. That's right. How do you know? You weren't born. You tell us over and over. These old stories bore everyone! You won't go to sleep, Emperor? I will when I want to. So, Jean... the calf? - No calf. - Lazybones! I can't force it to be born! I'm going to the inn. Wine to bottle. Coming, The Mouth? Lily of the Valley... Tell me when Monsieur arrives. Yes, Uncle. Let me see, Jean. What is it? This is a lizard and that will be a butterfly. It's pretty. Lily, come listen... You'll like meeting Monsieur. A nice marriage. A smart one too. Dictum's land, Moneybag's fortune... Plus what Monsieur put aside. - Leave that alone! - It's dusty. I'm old enough to dust it. Lily, answer your father. - Father... - Yes, child. I won't marry Monsieur. You won't marry him? I don't love him! Idiot, you've never seen him. Exactly. You don't marry a stranger! Father... not for money! Money can't buy happiness, but... - Come now, Tincture... - Dictum! All right, you're right. She wants you happy too. Girls should not be asked. I won't marry him. You don't love someone else? You love someone else. But who? It can't be Tonkin. Unbelievable! Tonkin! That good-for-nothing! Disease-ridden! Chinese diseases! - She loves him! - What? - What if she loves Tonkin? - Butt out! Heartless! Listen, Marie... I've had enough of you and your lazy son! I want you out! Tincture! You're going too far. Father, it's me or her. You choose! Tell me, Ma... We're not leaving? Slaving away for others... It's time! For Monsieur? The calf. Marie, get everything. Here, Emperor. Have your wine. - Not coming? - I don't care about the calf. Poor Jean... I'll go take a walk. Why didn't Marie give me my biscuit? Long live the Emperor! You, there! What a place! - Hungering to be born. - Beautiful! Instead of blabbering, change the litter! Stop, bastard! I saw you! Tonkin! Are you here? Don't hide! I saw you! It was you? Where's Tonkin? This is on purpose! So I won't catch him. You'll still keep us, Mistress, won't you? You and your mother will leave tomorrow! No, Mistress! At crack of dawn! - I don't want to! - Don't want to? You don't want to? - No, Mistress! - You want things now? Don't! You don't want to! Anyone home? No one here? No one here? Unbelievable. It never ends. My God. What about Monsieur? He made it to the farm. Finally! Look at you... What's the problem? He'll tell everyone. They'll see he's a coward. We went overboard. Not at all. We own up to our black sheep reputation. Put your bike behind. This really is terrible. And Tincture has disappeared. Poor Emperor. His heart gave out. We weren't always patient. Patience? He was 106! We deprived him of wine, his sole pleasure. Say that we killed him! Was someone killed here? Evening. What's going on? Emperor is dead. Dead? Heart attack. He died all alone, without anyone. We found him on the floor by the table. Heart attack? Look, Lawman. He could have fallen... or been hit. My God! That's impossible. Leave us alone. Who could have done this? And why? Wait. - The money is gone. - What money? None of your business. The carpenter brought us 10,000. Gone! - Call the gendarmes. - Are you out of your mind? - Spare the deceased money talk. - True. The gendarmes... The whole region would talk! They'll never set foot here! I was a gendarme. Goupi business concern only the Goupis. Especially if by misfortune the killer's a Goupi. Why are you looking at me? Do you mean me? Careful, Moneybags. I am being careful. - Goupis don't attack Goupis. - Relax. - Take it back! - I wasn't talking to you! You looked at me! Why not? It's my home! - Man's home is his castle! - Right! - Stop! - I didn't start. - Me? - Yes, you! Enough! Let's make a plan. He's resuscitated! Who hit you? See the thief? Tell us... Did you see him? So, Grandfather? He can't talk. He never had much to say. I'm such an idiot! If he can't talk, it's a disaster! How will we find the loot? That irks you. You never mentioned loot. Not suitable for women, especially one with your mouth. Explain! It's from Emperor's father. He worked the rails and found a treasure. But rolling stones gather no moss. The loot is here and only Emperor knows where. We won't forget today. I'm thirsty. Any wine here? - Sure. - Pour us a drink! Coming? What a story! Bad timing for Monsieur. Monsieur? I forgot all about him. - Where is he? - He's not here? You didn't bring him here? No, just to my shack. Your shack? I guess he prefered to come by foot. I thought he'd be here. I don't understand a thing. That's no surprise. All of this is strange. Tincture vanished, Monsieur vanished, the money vanished... and the old man got belted. Tomorrow is another day. Let's sleep on it. Come here! I found Monsieur! Moneybags found Monsieur? Let's tell Red Hands! Red Hands! Come, Moneybags found Monsieur! I found something else! - What could he have found? - A fox maybe. Come here. Moneybags, bring Monsieur! Red Hands is calling! We're on our way! Come, Monsieur. She was a harmful creature. - No. - Yes, a viper. It's no good. I'm going back to gunpowder. Here is Monsieur. Lawman, your grandfather. A former gendarme. Good to meet you. Your uncle Dictum. My pleasure. Your cousin Tonkin. My pleasure, Monsieur. So, what on earth did you find? What does this mean? I have no idea. She's dead. Belted in the head like Emperor. But it killed her. Poor child. Why was she in the woods? Tell me... It happened very close to you. Hear anything? You know I was asleep. What will we do now? She ran the whole house. She was so brave. Oh my God! I found something too. - What? - Come see! The money. It's all here. A little more, Grandfather. He drank his milk. He's not paralyzed. Old folk are stronger than us. Especially him. - Where were you? - With the rabbits. - Not eating? - I'm not hungry. I ate. - Just a drop? - No thanks. I doubt we'll ever see Tincture or Monsieur. - Why not? - Wait and see. Someone came in the back. - We found them. - Both of them? But... Tincture is dead. Impossible! - Her nastiness killed her. - Impossible! We found her in the woods. Murdered. How awful! Where are the workers? Louis is tilling the field. - And the others? - Not here yet. That's good news... We brought Tincture to my shack. I'll bring her here in the cart so no one sees. I'll come too. I won't go. I'm afraid of the dead. Let's not stay here. No, let's not. Strange place. Sit. All we need is a Negro maid. The gendarmes will see this... and judge. How so? No gendarmes! I'll find the killer. - By yourself? - Exactly. Fine with me. Hiding a crime makes us accomplices. Hard labor! Goupis settle Goupi problems! He's right. Fine, then we'll all go to prison! And no one will be jealous. - Where is she? - Outside, hidden. What happened? We'd like to find out. Toinette, this is Monsieur. My daughter. - Monsieur. - Miss. We call her Lily. Not now. We're taking Tincture to the farm. What do we tell everyone? We'll say that... she fell off a ladder in the barn. You stay here. Meet us later, Tonkin. With Monsieur. See you. Stay. You're too young to groom a corpse. Stay too, so we can meet, cousin. Sit. Like my hut? I built it myself. I had one in Tonkin. It's not France here. You've traveled? No, I don't think so. I was in the infantry. 5 years in the jungle. Nothing better than traveling. That and love. - Excuse me... - You're no bother. I see, but I need to see my room. Yeah, go see your room. - See you soon. - That's right. Are you angry? - Yes. - Why? People mustn't get things wrong. It'll turn out right. Let go. Let me go! Here it is. I'll open the curtains. It's dark. Best room. Tincture prepared it for you. Who's he? My son. Unsocial. Don't mind him. Why are you here? I wouldn't go. Afraid of the dead. This misfortune is no fun for you. You got that right. And lots of expenses. Expenses? Goodness! The funeral... Closed due to funeral Let's hurry. But we're early. He's right. Hurry before they get back. Come on! If he could talk. Just one word. The 200,000-franc word. Who knows? 300,000? A million maybe? Where did you hide the loot? Hear me? Nothing doing. Emperor, we'll walk you through the house. When we're near the spot, make a sign. We'll understand. That's not right. We won't hurt him. A million is a lot. We'll put him here. We'll start in the attic. Poor Tincture. It was a nice ceremony. Nothing like a native rite with Buddhist monks and tam-tams. I don't find that funny. Listen to him... Monsieur is right. My poor Aunt... Already ganging up? - What nonsense! - I always talk nonsense. Careful, don't drop him. Lift him up. What happened? I don't get it. Who saw him last? It was me... but I left him in his bed. I should have stayed. No end in sight. - Meaning? - Emperor has vanished. - That way, maybe. - You're wasting your time. Maybe we'll have more luck in the basement. The others. House of miracles! The crippled walking by themselves. Maybe not by themselves. Careful! I knew you were up to something. You're mad. We took him for a walk, change of scenery. - You're the madman. - Keep quiet! Jean, unhitch the mare. Put Emperor back to bed. What nerve! You tend to him. I'm getting undressed What fun. - You need treatment. - Spare me! Find the loot? Nothing at all. If someone found it before, it would explain. Explain what? Tincture's murder. Don't you think, Tonkin? Not again! - Not Tonkin! - No one said that. You're frank as a scorpion! Good-for-nothings can do anything! I'd like to rest up in my room. Go rest up, cutie. What were you doing alone in the woods? I took a shortcut and got lost. A shortcut? First time here. And I went astray. Who are you, Monsieur? Who am I? A stranger. We know nothing about you. This is nonsense! My son runs a Paris department store! You can't suspect me. I had no idea the loot existed. Recognize this? My comb. I found it on the floor. So you came here that night. Why not tell anyone? It's not true! It's true. I came. My God! Why did you do this? I did nothing! You lied to us! Why? Talk! I'm fed up with this! I come at night to a strange land. A family of strangers beckons me for no reason. A crazy man picks me up, a Bluebeard. Thanks! Everyone wants to scare me silly. Empty house, half-dead man. Wasn't it normal to leave? But why did you lie? Embarrassed to admit I lost my head! Since I'm a stranger, take my papers. Maybe the loot is in there. An envelope from his store. Nouvelles Galeries de l'Op?ra. Money. Pay slip. Forget to pay an employee? Yes, uh... I mean... "Name: "Goupi, Eug?ne. "Post: sales. Department: ties." Well, well... "Salary: 1,400 francs." Paris store owners don't make much. "Com: 423 francs." What's "com"? A commission on sales. What are you? Manager or employee? An employee. I sell ties. So what? I thought you drove your car by the Op?ra! Goupi Monsieur? Goupi Bowtie! Murderer! Thief! My God! Enough already! I never stole, never killed! This is nonsense. It may not be him! Get outside! You too, The Mouth! Outside, Marie! Where is the loot? I swear you'll talk! You took the loot! Leave him alone now. You women, get out! Where's the loot? - I didn't take it. - Crook. I'm innocent! Don't you understand? This loot thing is pathetic. I see you hoarding centimes. "A centime is a centime. "And 5 make a sou. And a sou is a sou." No, a sou is zero. A sou is nothing. How sad. I'm off. Me too. Better to say he's insane. He is. Claiming that a sou is nothing... I'd like to believe you... I don't care what you think. Get out, all of you! He's my son! He has to answer to me! Only me! Beat it! Why don't you tell him why you brought him here? Get lost! We're going. Don't do anything foolish. I'm warning you. Father or not... Put that down, idiot. Put it down. Sit down. Sit. Thirsty? Tell me about your mother. My mother? She left me. I didn't kick her out. She had no ill will. - She mentioned me? - Yes, sometimes. To say what? "The good man didn't understand me." Exactly! A bird with a birdbrain who thought money was for spending. So what? Fine at first, then you end up in hospital. And you opted for jail. Father, I swear you're wrong. I'll tell the others you're innocent, but where's the loot? What is it? The loot, the loot. It's all you can say! Thief! Will you talk or not? She clutched onto life, with all this poison. Marie! Move away. Moneybags may see you. Jean, you get out too. Bread and water. - Why? - Don't ask, obey. Stand up. - Why? - To lock you in the stable. - I'm going to Paris. - Not like that! - What a strange father. - Strange son. You can't sequester me! Such big words! Prefer the guillotine? Move forward. And don't falter. It's better. The guillotine... Go inside. Make a bed with the straw. No smoking. - I'll help you. - No, thank you. - Uncle... - What? I know he's innocent. You said the same for me. Mind your own business! - It didn't take long. - What? You love him. It's obvious you do. That's not true. - But... - But what? Nothing. So are you having fun? A real blast. Your dinner. How kind of you. - All you have to say? - Yes... Still innocent. As you wish. Goodnight. Monsieur? Lily? Here. I have to go. Wait, stay a little. Ham for a thief, a murderer? It's not you. You may be wrong. I'm a stranger. You're suffering. At home we all are. - Not my father. - Unhappiest of all. I told him he's wrong. You're sweet, Lily. I'd like to help you. Someone's coming! You'll be back? Take this. - What for? - What are razors for? Why must I shave? The schoolmaster is coming. He wants to meet you. How kind of him. Even a thief and murderer can honor his family. I've never murdered, and not with these. Let me. You'd cut yourself. Sit down. Good morning, Schoolmaster. Are you well? Thanks for coming to the funeral. My condolences. Have a seat, Schoolmaster. We miss poor Tincture. She ran the house. That's true. It's a great loss. What if I told the schoolmaster? I'm just Goupi Bowtie? You won't. I know it. - Why not? - You're a Goupi. You're clean... Come. How is Emperor? Excuse me, I mean your father. - Still paralyzed. - What's worn is worn. Your grandson's presence must be comforting. No doubt about it. Here he is. My son Eug?ne. He has a big job in Paris. Monsieur, you live in the brain of France. Obviously... in the brain! Do you have a cigarette? Of course I do, Monsieur. I was in Paris once myself in 1931. During the Colonial Exposition. How marvelous! - The Exposition? - No, Paris. Ah, Paris! The Op?ra, the boulevards, our museums... Ah, the Paris museums. - Hello, sir. - Hello, my dear... Say something. Do you know what Paris is? Goodness, yes and no. Paris is a symphony. What do you mean by that? It's you, sir. It's Dictum. Paris is Moneybags... Lawman. Paris is the provinces. Do you understand? Perfectly. You meet people from Provence, Charente, Normandy. All these different people make Paris... Paris. A bouquet in which each province is a flower. How pretty. Such eloquence... Eloquence isn't hard. Listen to me. Indochina is surrounded by the Irrawaddy, the Salween, the Menam, the Mekong and the Red River. I know. It includes Burma, Malacca, Siam, Cambodia, French Vietnam, Annam, Laos... and Tonkin. This is eloquence! This isn't an exam! What is Paris, France, Europe? Sad people, gray skies. There we have sun, light, every color! Orange, red, green, yellow, powder blue, navy blue! There, they have navy blue! - There, there... - In the Orient. Monsieur is talking about the capital. Who cares about the capital? The capital! Malaria. A minor flare-up. Pay no attention. Not at all a problem. I won't bother you any longer. Goodbye, Schoolmaster. - Thrilled to have met you. - Me too. - See you soon. - I hope. Goodbye, Lily. I'll see you out. Don't bother. I know the way. - Very polite man. - Very. I'll say, Monsieur, you're a good speaker. A good memorizer. That was the dictation for my final exam. With that good memory, remember where you hid the loot? Where are you going? The stable. Stubborn as a mule! Here. - Cigarettes... - I bought them in town. Why are you looking at me like that? - This region of yours is pretty. - It's yours too. Barely. So inhospitable. I hope they find who did it, so you'll be free. But... But? But you'll leave. - You don't smoke? - I do. - Tonkin wouldn't be happy to see us. - Why? He'd get the wrong idea. - What idea? - He's not jealous? He has no reason to be. - He seemed... - Tonkin is my cousin. - You seem very close. - Only normal for cousins. Well, I too am your cousin. I brought you an apple. Want to share? Why are you laughing? Eating apples does that. It's true. I don't even know why my father sent for me. Do you? Do you know? Don't lie. Yes, I do. Is it that complicated? But sort of funny. They sent for you... to marry me off. With who? With you. I'll be damned. Us, married? But... you don't love me. Of course not. Nor do you. Staring at the scenery? My dear Lily, you know... What now, lazybones? Careful. You'll interrupt a nice love scene. I said to butt out! - Beat it! - Uncle... Go! Haven't you caused enough harm? Move it! Move! - Move! - If you insist. I don't care anymore. - Is Dictum here? - Next door. I need to talk. - Busy. - It's important! It would blow a quail to smithereens! - Much ado about nothing. - I need to talk. Yes, I'm lazy. Good-for-nothing. - We know. - What is it? I really love Lily. Understand? Give her to me. I'll work here. Empty promises! You can't leave her to that tie salesman! - No... - Give her to me. I'm a Goupi. Neither of you will marry Lily. - Unreliable! - I'd rather see her a spinster. Your last word? Ties... Would you like to buy a tie, ma'am? For your husband, a little tie. Pure silk. Don't like it in blue? Take it in red. It makes a nice bowtie. A little tie... Bastard! Poor Tonkin. Unhappy wretch. I'm going to see Moneybags. Ties! - Lawman... - What will you have? - Thanks but I'm on duty. - On duty? I'm here to see Marcelin Goupi, aka Moneybags. Here I am. What is it? Is your son Eug?ne from Paris staying here with you? - Yes. - Where? I don't know. He comes and goes. Out hunting with Red Hands. Not in your stable? - My God! - What? Sorry, I've always liked the Goupis, but I've heard some bad things. - Nonsense. - We'll soon see. - Do you have a search warrant? - I do. Prove it. What? You, Lawman? A former gendarme? I'm a Goupi. All in order? - Perfectly. - Now get moving. Now we're in for it. Red Hands, come! I'm coming! Spare yourself. I don't like you in this state. - Then go see them. - Who? Our charming family. They wanted a party. Party's over. More foolishness? Go look. I'll see you after. I won't see the Goupis today. To start with, 10,000 francs was stolen. From who? What do you mean? From you! Us? News to me. Missing 10,000 francs? Not me. Maybe Moneybags. I didn't notice. You, The Mouth? - God, no. And you, Marie? - Never. So it'll be like this? Fine. You'll see. Your loot vanished. Not a laughing matter. To reiterate: your loot vanished. There was loot in the house! Gift from Santa Claus! - Who knew? - Did you, Emperor? How much was this loot worth? Don't push it! Contempt of an officer, hindering justice. Punishable by a fine of 16 to 200 francs. Article 224! Be my guest! Enough! What is this? Tincture was murdered 5 days ago and you dare poke fun? Tincture fell off a ladder. Prove it! You can't deny sequestering your son. - I was punishing him. - Punishing? He was rude to Emperor. Right? It's true. I was rude to my great-grandfather. And I'm sorry. You make fun of me, but don't badmouth Emperor. He was beaten badly and is now mute. I'd like some red wine, with a biscuit. Hello, Eus?be. You see? I'll write the prefect and get you fired. We'll see. Now I'll question you separately. Get to it! Him first. Take him next door. - No one else moves. - Why him. I feel like it. Where was he? - With the animals. - Make him stay put. - This way? - In there. - Eus?be is an idiot. - I'll say! You must be thrilled that they're here! Tincture would have saved us. The gendarmes wouldn't be here. True. I'm talking nonsense. What is it now? The gendarmes are here. We'll have to sell our land and leave. Now that's odd... The Emperor's clock stopped. How strange. Listen, Red Hands. Listen. - I am. - Only you can save us. I'm neither God nor Devil. You're the smart one. Really? Since when? Just now? You're a Goupi too. Lawman... you didn't always say that. Ever think of Goupi La Belle? You forbade us to marry and she died. Says you. Now all that is history. Bastard. Grandfather! Uncle... What is it? Why are you so glum? - They took Monsieur. - What's it to you? What? But this is awful! I thought you liked Tonkin. Well... Tonkin said he wanted to marry me, that he needed me. Poor Tonkin. He missed out on everything. So you love Monsieur? We'll help Monsieur. - Save him? - Try to. - How? - I don't know. What really happened here that night? - Can't remember. - Me neither. I bottled some wine. And the calf was born. The calf wasn't all. How did Tincture seem? She was in a lousy mood, as usual. That's all. That's not true! She kicked us out of here! Don't listen to this idiot! Tell me about it upstairs. What does he want from the boy? Have a seat. Let's talk a little. She wanted to kick you out? Then what? Everyone was with the calf. And you? I went for a walk. And Tincture? She ran after me with a whip. I went to the woods. And then? She came into the woods. She shouted: "I know you're here, Tonkin!" So I came out and she whipped me. She said "I saw you, Tonkin"? Jean, you know what happened. Tell the truth. It was Tonkin. Go away, I can't remember. It was Tonkin! Not Tonkin. It was me. My little Jean... You're trying to scare me. It's not true. It wasn't him. I know! - It was me. - He's lying and I know why. I'll see to this. What will you do? Don't tell the gendarmes I came. 1400 a month. Barely puts food on the table in Paris. - Plus coms... - Be polite! I said plus coms, commission on sales. All right. That's better. So tell me... They say you own a store. They also say I'm a killer. - Maybe they're right. - A match? Who in the family saw you first? Uncle L?opold picked me up at the station. L?opold? Who is he? - Red Hands. - Oh, him! By the way... where is he? Lawman... In prison. You too, Dictum. In prison. As for you, Moneybags... nothing to discuss... The guillotine. You messed things up. Serves them right. For denying me Lily. - She didn't love you. - She did. Before Monsieur got here. Why? What's going on over there? Jean admitted to killing Tincture. Jean did? You were wrong. The gendarmes won't let up. Meaning? They'll find who stole the 10,000. You! Me? Yeah, right... I saw you leave it by Tincture. Yes, it was me. I thought the money would help me leave. I was sick of the Goupis, this place. Sick of everything! I thought I'd go to Bordeaux! But when I saw the corpse... I chickened out. Why didn't you say Jean killed Tincture, if you knew? How could I know? I was on the road. I never went inside. What is it? Liar. You went inside for the 10,000 francs. I guess I did go inside. So what? You ran, Tincture followed. Tincture? Nonsense... Jean told me so. She followed me. So? So you came back knowing she'd never speak again. Poor Tonkin. You did that for 10,000 francs. You killed her. Yes, I killed her. But it wasn't for money. She was whipping Jean. I'd never seen such meanness. Bitch! Looking for me? Snake! What do we do? Nothing matters to me. Nothing. Run away. First confess to it on paper. Then run. Surrender. Officer! - Where is he? - There, in the tree. Peekaboo! Down or I'll fire! - You can't! - It's to scare him. I'll shoot you! Come on up! - Who's he kidding? - Nowhere to go! - Come down, idiot! - I can't see him now. He's on the branch. Come! Come and get me! - Don't make it worse! - Come. Come down! Tonkin, come down! Never! I'll never come down! What's going on up there? It's Tonkin! Madman. Stop talking or he'll jump. No way. I'm going to shoot! Look how small they are! They're like ants! Ugly little ants! I'll jump and squash you all! Tonkin! Listen, it's Red Hands! No more Red Hands! Go screw off now, you hear? Screw off! Tonkin is history! I see distant lands! If I could fly away, I would! Do something. You dirty moles! Poor Tonkin. I can see the light! The light, the sun! I can see the sun! I can see it. Yes! I can see it! I am the sun! Poor Tonkin. Why are you here? I just came. - It's not right. - What? Why do you have this? I'm in pain too. His pain was worse. It wasn't my fault. Of course not. What Tonkin did was for me alone. Understand? I can't explain it. I can come here. You can't. But, Jean... Don't stay. It's not right. Jean is right. Come... We're waiting for you for lunch. Come... Don't be a baby. I know where the loot is. I know when you found it. When you wound up my clock. It's there... Everyone saw it without realizing. Perfect hiding place. We thought it was brass, but it's gold. The weights are gold too. You painted over them. Pretty penny's worth. You must tell them. I'll act stupid. It's you who must tell them. If ever you die... I don't intend to. It's life. I'll tell them for Epiphany when we eat our galette. I don't want to offend you, but... you won't make it. I'll tell them for Christmas. You won't be with us. Is it that bad? It's strange. Better, but not strong enough. Red Hands is with Emperor. What could they be saying? So, you'll tell them... Yes, you will... Come closer. - Grandfather. - Sweetie. - Grandfather. - Hello, my boy... What could they be saying? A hungry belly has no ears. Soup? Wait. He'll end up leaving. Why not invite him? Why not? He won't leave. Maybe they're discussing the wedding. Emperor would like to be around for it. If that's what you want. Here he comes. You're not eating, Uncle? - If you all insist... - Good to hear it. Have a seat, Uncle. What about our soup? I know where the loot is. - What? - I saw the loot myself. - Where? - I won't say. Thief! I don't care about money. Emperor forbade me to say where. Unbelievable! His wish is that it stays where it is. No one touches it. Except to keep the land, if need be. It's money found, not money earned. Listen to me, Monsieur. You don't know about farmers. They respect money because money is work. The land is low, as we say. For them, 5 centimes is a sou. Understand? Yes, Red Hands, I do. When my time comes, I'll tell you what Emperor told me, just as his father showed him way back when. You'll get married, have kids. When your time comes, you'll tell the eldest Goupi, whoever that may be, And so on, as long as there are Goupis.
