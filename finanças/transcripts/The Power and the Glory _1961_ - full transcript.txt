Remember, God is dead, God is dead. - You and your painless revolutions. (dentist drill whirring) (man grunting) Oh, I know, I know, I mustn't say anything disrespectful. Well, I obey the law, I don't get drunk anymore, I don't drug anymore, women, I don't even play billiards. - You shouldn't have given up billiards, even my lieutenant has nothing against billiards. - Oh your lieutenant, he sees the worst of everything, it's a habit strong men have, you won't retire yet, will you? - Why? - Because he'll replace you, and at my age, I can't stomach strong men, rinse. (door knocking) Come in. - [Announcer] Remember, God is dead, God is dead. - Are you the dentist? - Isn't it obvious? - I have an old filling which has worked loose, it needs attention. - Can't you see I'm busy attending the chief of police, all right, you can wait. (man grunting) - No more for today. - But I haven't finished. - I'll come back tomorrow. I should've shot you with the others. Billiards tonight? - Hmm? - I wanna play billiards tonight. - Oh, wow. - I haven't broke 10 since this tooth started aching. - Come, sit over here, I can't give you much time. - Didn't I get the words right? - Well, best say them over again. - I have an old filling which has worked loose, it needs attention. - Where? - Oh, the upper incisor. - You're late. - I'm sorry. - Gonzales told me to expect you last night. - I was busy. - Your teeth are terrible, too. - I know, have you got the papers? - Yes, everything is in order, ticket, embarkation permit, you name's Micha Lopez. - Thank you. (boat whistle blaring) - Oh, don't worry about the boat, it always leaves late, you wait for the third whistle, - that's the next one... - Oh. - Get on board with the last rush. - Thank you, would you care for some brandy? - Where'd you get that? - Brandy is a good dentist. Forgive me, in my profession I have to make little jokes sometimes to make people laugh, sometimes they do laugh. - Not at that one. What is your profession? - Oh, I'm a doctor. - Qualified? - No. - I don't like quacks. - Well, I'm not a quack, exactly, I'm what you might call a traveler in medicine. - (gasps), that's ghastly stuff. - That window must've been quite beautiful. - Yes, I got it when they sacked the church. Well, it didn't seem right somehow, a dentists office without a piece of stained glass. You know, 10 years ago, I could've got out, I could've paid my passage home, started a practice, then along comes your revolution, down falls the place, and here I am, stuck in this godforsaken socialist heaven. - You remember before the red shirts came, this was a happy place then. - I didn't notice. - They had at least God. Why, don't you believe in him? - Oh, I used to believe in something somewhere, now I believe in nothing, nowhere. Why, and why do you ask? - What? - About God? Latin. A prayer book. Damn you! Do you think I do this out of charity or conviction? I'd get any crook out of the country if it helped to pay my passage home, but a priest. All right, give me your money and get the hell out of this, father, or senior, eminence. - Are you going to give me up? - Do you think I wouldn't like to? What are you doing here anyway? Don't you know what they do to priests in this state? - Yes. - Why're you here then? - I never went away. When the others left, I stayed. At first, it wasn't so bad, I had the friends, but then it got bad, now... - You're not just a drunk, you're a sickness, people die of contact with you. (boat whistle blaring) - Forgive me, you have been very kind, God keep you. - Let him keep you, you're his property, not mine. (door knocking) Hello? - Are you the doctor? - No, I'm the dentist, why? - They said you were a doctor. - Why, got a pain or something? - [Child] No, my mother, she's very sick with fever. - Well, everyone has fever this time of the year. - [Child] She's dying. - Where do you come from? - [Child] El Catrin, please come. - Well, I told you, look, I only fix teeth, if you wanna see a doctor, you'll have... - Are you the doctor? She's dying, I know she's dying. - Always they say, they're dying. - Well, that puts her under your jurisdiction, doesn't it, doctor? - When she looks at me, she doesn't even know who I am. - [Dentist] Hey, just a minute, you know you missed that boat, don't you? - Perhaps I was meant to. (calm guitar music) (upbeat orchestral music) - You wanted me? - [Chief] Oh yes, there's the letter from the governor. - And what does he want? - [Chief] Two things, first, the gringo murderer, got a policeman in Veracruz, and seems to be coming our way. - Well, if he's within our borders, I'll catch him. - Excellent, he's also wanted in the States for killing two seaman. - G-men, what else does the governor want? - [Chief] That priest. - There's no priest! - He thinks there is! - In other states there's still priests because the police are corrupt, 'cause they're sentimental and don't shoot them like the vermin they are, but not here. - Your passion is commendable, nevertheless, he says there's a priest. - Suppose this were true, how would I find him? There's not even a photograph. - There's now a photograph, from the governor. - Oh, he looks like any other priest, well fed, well shaved, soft hands, we've shot him half a dozen times. - Well, the picture's very old. - You know what this reminds me of? The stink of incense, candles, white lace, old peasants kneeling making of their buddies a crucifix, while their pockets are being plundered of their last centavo, and what do these gentlemen offer in return? Sacrifice of a little sexual indulgence. - I think that's something. - It's nothing, I too am dedicated, I too have little need of women. What are my orders? - Catch him before the rains begin. - Can I do it my own way? - Something in mind? - Well, it's a small state, mountains on the north side sea to the south, I would beat it, it should be the street, house by house. - [Chief] You make it sound easy. - If he's in this area, he's being protected by the peasants, I would take a hostage from each village, and if I found that the priest had been there, I would kill the hostage and take another, and I would go on killing until he had no place to go. - Great many would die, of course. - It would be worth it. (calm guitar music) - She is not dying. - [Peasant] Thank you, father. - Can you let me have a hammock for the night? - [Peasant] We have none, father. - A little spirit, perhaps? - Tea, coffee, father. - Some food? - We have no food. - Then I will rest here for the night. - [Peasant] Father, it's not safe. - You want me to go? - [Peasant] It would be better, father. It's been five years since we have seen a priest, baby boy has not been baptized. - I will do it for two pesos. - I don't have two pesos. - One, then. - Father, we have nothing. - Then give me some clothes. - We have only what we wear. - Take mine in exchange. - Why? - It'll make me harder to recognize. - Very well, father, and confession, will you hear my confession before you go? - Do you mind if I finish my coffee? - Well, it would be a pity if the soldiers came before we had time... - Very well, very well. - Such a burden on poor souls. - Yes, yes, very well. - (speaks in foreign language). - (speaks in foreign language). - Oh bless me, father, for I have sinned, it has been five years since my last confession, and in that time, I have stolen, I have borne false witness, I have denied my God and my church. (dramatic music) - Padre Jose, get your fat carcass out of bed, it's the police! - What have I done? I've done nothing. - Jose, I want some information, you know the man I seek. - The gringo? - No, this one. - No, I don't know him. - Well, perhaps you did once? Where was his parish? Where was his parish? - I believe in Carmen. - So close, and his home? - I'm not sure. - It would be better if you were sure. - He was born in Concepcion. - Carmen and Concepcion. - Yes. - Thank you, Jose. Is it not good to obey the law? (door creaking) (curious music) - Where are you? It's all right. - Psst, I'm here. Hope you don't mind. - Oh, help yourself. I brought something to sustain you. - To sustain me? - Two chicken legs and a bottle of beer. - Oh. - But if you're very hungry, you must eat slowly, or you'll just throw it all up. - I think I'll risk it. I don't suppose you have any brandy? - I'm afraid not, you see, we're Americans and my father is very careful about obeying the law, this is government beer, it's still legal. Are you a criminal? - Well, not exactly, I'm a priest. - Oh, that's too bad. - Thank you. - My name is Coral. - Thank you, Coral. - Why don't you give yourself up? - Well, it is my duty not to, you see? - Why? - Because I'm the last priest left alive in this state, you see? - It's a problem, but maybe you could renounce. - Do what? - [Coral] Renounce your faith. - Oh, that's impossible. - I guess it's something like a birthmark. Maybe I could find my father's brandy... - No, no, no, no, no, you mustn't, Coral dear, won't he be looking for you? - Oh no, I always come out here to memorize. - [Priest] Memorize? - Poems, see? Come back, come back, he cried in grief, across the stormy water, and I'll forgive your highland chief, my daughter, oh my daughter. Correct? - Perfect, you get 100%. - I always do. - You know, I have a daughter too. - [Coral] How can a priest have a daughter? - If he is a bad one. - Is she pretty? - I don't know, I've never seen her. - What? - I would like very much to see her. - Then you ought to. You could make your way to her stealthily, and if you were ambushed, you could always come back here, you would just tap at my window. Perhaps it would be better to have a code, you must tap three times, two long taps and a short. - How do you tap a long tap? - Like this, long, long, short. - Ah, you mean a loud one. - Oh, I call them long because of Morse code. (sweet music) - Well, you have been very kind, Coral, I do thank you so very, very much. - [Coral] That's all right. - Will you pray for me? - Oh, I don't believe in that. - Not in praying? - I don't believe in God. You see, I lost my faith when I was 10. - Dear, dear, then I will just have to pray for you. - All right, if you like, you don't sound afraid anymore. - No. - Wait, I'll go first. (suspenseful music) All right. Goodbye, I hope you escape. If they kill you, I shan't forgive them, ever. - Where did you get those clothes? I'll ask you again, where did you get those clothes? - Halt there. Now, I know the priest has been here, if you tell me where he is, you will save this man's life. (gunshot booming) (woman screaming) - Is it you, father? - You didn't recognize me? - You've changed. - [Priest] Well, you have not. - Where did you get those clothes? - From a peasant. - What did you do with yours? - Gave them to him in exchange. - Why? - They were very conspicuous out of the city. - I would have hidden them for you, I don't like it, father, now you look like any other man. - That was the idea. How is our daughter? - She's as well as rest of us, what did you expect? - I would like to see her. - [Brigida] No, no! - Brigida, Brigida, Brigida, what are you doing? - Mama! (sweet music) - Brigida, this is your father. - Brigida, my dear. - Are you the gringo? - Well, what gringo? - You silly, the soldiers have been looking for a man. - I never considered they're looking for another man, what has he done? - He murdered some people up north. - Are you the gringo? - Do I look like a murderer? - I don't know. - Brigida, do you know your catechism, who made you? - [Maria] She knows, she knows her catechism, but she never says it. - Why won't you to say it, Brigida, God wants you to. - (sneers). - Ooh, you little devil! - Stop it! - Hang on, Maria, now don't be afraid, Brigida, you're not afraid, are you? - Go on, say something! - Now, let her be, Maria, hmm? - I'll get you some food. - Yeah, yeah. What games do you like to play, Brigida? If only we had some cards, I could show you some conjuring tricks, and then you could teach the other children. Do you know how to send messages with taps? Long, long, short. Oh yes, of course, that's a game children play, I know. Brigida, my father used to have a proverb, he used to say, The best smell was bread, the best taste salt, and the best love, love of children. How can I make you love me, Brigida? - (sneers). - Brigida, Brigida come back here! - No! - Brigida! - Let her go, Maria. - Ah, you see what that child is like, she's wicked. - A child cannot be wicked. - The child of a priest? You know, there's a curse on the child of a priest. - Not on the child. - Yes, on the child, on me, on you, there's nothing we can do. - You've got to try. - It does no good. - That is what everybody says all the time, it does no good. Well, my children, I'm glad to see you... - Are you going to be here long, father? - I thought I might rest a few days. - Couldn't you move a bit farther north? They say that churches are still open beyond the border. - But this is my parish, I want to rest, and I will say mass for you in the morning. What's wrong, you know me here, you know the sort of priest I am, whiskey priest? All the same, I'm the only one who can give you his body and his blood. If you tell me to go, I will, but he will go with me. Are we to go, he and I? - The soldiers are taking hostages from each village, if the people don't tell where you are, they're killed. - You were at El Catrin, father. - Who did they... - Old Montez. - Oh! Why don't they catch me? The fools, why don't they catch me? I am a man in moral sin with no one to who hear my confession, but all the same, I'm all you have. - Of course you will stay here tonight, it's the least we can do. - It is not what I want or what you want, but what must be. I was asleep now, and in the morning, an hour before dawn, I will say mass. (dramatic music) There was no love in her conception, nothing but fear, despair and half a bottle of brandy. - Drink, father. - Five minutes of lust. - I was proud of being a priests woman. - Why do I feel for her this appalling love? - Drink, father. Now, sleep. - If I were to go, the people would be safe, and in all the space between the mountains and the sea, God would cease to exist. - Sleep, father. - Even though they despise me, even though they are corrupted by my ways or murdered for my sake, isn't it still my duty to stay, huh? - Sleep, father. - I alone can put God in a man's mouth. - Sleep, father, sleep, sleep. - [Advertiser] There, your hair looks lovely, just lovely, and to keep it that way, of course, Breck hair set mist, the gentle spray that keeps your hair softly in place for hours.

Never get tired then of suffering the police who beat you, the soldiers gathering taxes, smallpox, the fever, the hunger, these are that preparation, the preparation for heaven, and without them, heaven could not be. - The soldiers are coming here. - Heaven is where there are no unjust laws, no taxes, no soldiers, no hunger, you will never be afraid there or unsafe, there are no red shirts, no one ever grows old, the crops never fail. Oh, it is easy to say all the things that are not in heaven, but what there is there is God, what there is here in this place, at this moment, is God, and there are no words to describe his love. Princes have their power and great men their glory, but of the love of God, they have no more than the least, no more than you, no more than I, and in all of living, this is the loveliest thing. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, amen. - Soldiers are coming. - How far? - About a mile. - [Man] Father, quickly they're here. - Wait, wait. - Give me the cloth! (dramatic music) Inside, inside. - I must leave at once. - Oh, you fool, they are all around the village, quick. Quick, onto the bed. Let me smell your breath. Oh my God, anyone can tell, wine, what would we be doing with wine. Eat this onion. - The cakes, Maria. - Oh, nevermind your cakes, lie down quick. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - Out, everybody out! Bring the child. (gunshot booming) (crowd chattering) Come on, out, everybody out! Everybody over there. They're all here, lieutenant. - All right, all right. - [Officer] All right, come on, come on, move. Closer! - Now, listen to me, I'm looking for two men, one is a gringo murder and I can see very well he's not here, but I want you to keep your eyes open, there's a reward of 500 pesos for his capture. The other is a priest, you all know what that means, a traitor to the republic, and anyone who shelters him is a traitor too. He's the last priest in the state and I have sworn to take him before the rains, and there's a reward of 700 pesos for his capture. Well, has a priest ever owed you 700 pesos, huh? What has God ever done for you? Look here, your children got enough to eat? Instead of food, they talk to you about heaven, Everything's gonna be fine after you're dead. They say. Well, I tell you, everything's gonna be fine after they're dead, you think me a hard man, but this child means more to me than the Pope in Rome. Now, you don't have to speak, if he's here among you, all you have to do is look at him and I will know. All right, I'm going to take a hostage from this village, and if I find the priest has been here, I'm going to kill the hostage. Why don't you trust me? I don't want any of you to die, in my eyes, can't you understand, you're with far more than he is? You're my people, I want to give you everything, all you have to do is look at him. You, I take you. - No, he's my son, you can't take my son! - Every man is somebody's husband or somebody's son. - Lieutenant. - Yes? - Take me. - Why? - I'm sick, I'm not good for much. - Then you're no good for a hostage. Hey, come here. What's your name? - Lopez. - [Lieutenant] What do you do? - I have a little land. - [Lieutenant] You married? - Yes. - [Lieutenant] Which is your wife? - I'm his wife, why do you ask so many questions? Do you think he looks like a priest? - Let me see your hands, let me smell your breath, come on. All right, you can go. Wait a minute, you know everybody in this village, don't you? Who is this man, what is his name? - I don't know. - [Lieutenant] You mean he's a stranger. - The child doesn't know her own name. - [Lieutenant] Be quiet. - Just ask her who her father is. - Who's your father? - Him. - All right, you can go. All right, go on. (dramatic music) - [Maria] They took the best man in the village. - Is it my fault if they won't betray me? - You think God wants you to be a martyr, a whiskey priest like you? That's why people laugh at the church. - [Priest] Give me the wine, Maria, there is enough for 12 more mass. - No, you've said your last mass, no one else will die, even if it brings a curse on me. (bottle smashing) (dramatic music) - You should not have done that. - You won't need this either! Or this (grunts)! - You should not have done that. (woman sobbing) It is up to you to give me up, not up to me to be caught. - I fear they've gone north, father, toward the border. - I must go where I can purchase wine, I'm no use to the people without it. Goodbye, Maria. Brigida, listen to me, I'm your father and I love you, you're so important. The governor up in the city goes guarded by men with guns, but you have all the angels. - (spits).

The soldiers, they passed by this way earlier. - Oh yes, I heard they were looking for a gringo. - Yeah, a real pistolero. Yeah, they say he come up to you, and for no reason, bang. Ah, but perhaps you carry a gun. - [Priest] No. - Ah, that is good, senor. - Why do you call me senor? - Anyone can tell you are an educated man, what an important looking bag. Oh look, stay here with me, I guide you to the city in the morning. - I don't need a guide. - You don't trust me, just 'cause I'm a poor man who likes to do a good for a stranger, you don't trust me. The police, they look for another man too, 700 pesos reward. Ah, stay here, huh? You can say a prayer before we go to sleep. - Prayer? Do you think I'm a priest? - Oh, I'm a good Christian, father, I would not betray you. - You're wrong. - I could easily find out, couldn't I? All I have to say is, father hear my confession. You couldn't refuse. - In God's name, what do you want? Are you my Judas? - Is that what you think? You think I want the reward? You think a poor man like me cannot afford to tell the police? - I wish to go on into the city. - All right, father, if you insist, and I come too, I know the city, you need me there. - No. - Okay, but I follow, you cannot get rid of me. (dramatic music) (guitar music) Didn't I tell you, you could not get rid of me? Hey, you sold the mule. - Yes. - And you bought new clothes, how much they cost? - Not much. - Not much, all my life, I have to slave just for a bare crust, sometimes I think I'd do anything, do anything just for a few pesos, can you blame me? - Why should I? - You eat too, didn't you? - No, I've not eaten in 24 hours. - (speaks in foreign language) why you lie to me? Lying is a sin! - I'm not lying. - How much you got left? - 29 pesos. - Then why haven't you eaten? - I wanna spend it on drink. - You mean spirits? - Yes. - That is against the law. - And wine. - How much would you pay? - I will give 15 pesos for a bottle of genuine grape wine. - I know where I can get it. Didn't I tell you I'd be of help to you in the city? Come on. (upbeat music) We wait for him upstairs. - You sure he can get it? - Oh, of corse, he can get anything, you know why? He's the cousin of the governor, he gets it legal, from the customs. - I wrote a letter back to England last night. - Planning to leave us? - Yes, if I can locate my relatives, if they'll have me. - Oh, you'll never leave us. - Well, I keep trying. - The trouble with you, my friend, is you worry too much, now take me... - [Dentist] Yes, I've noticed don't worry, you don't work either. - I don't have to, my lieutenant is so efficient, right now he's off chasing some priest. - Well, I hope he doesn't catch him. - Oh, he will. Since we've started taking hostages, the villagers turn the priest away, poor man has no place to go, no place at all. - Look, I will give you the money, and then you can buy the wine and keep the change, huh? - Hey. - You're so fond of money. - Oh, everyone is when they haven't got any. Now, look, don't worry, you'll get your drink. - I said wine. - Okay, wine. - Not homemade wine, French wine. - Californian? - Will do. - Hey, that sounds like him, although, if you got your wine, you won't forget to offer him a drink? - I wasn't going to open it here, I was going to take it away. - To where? - [Priest] Home. - You know where home is? Any place there's a bottle and two glasses. - Oh, it's you. Who's this? - He's a friend of mine, he wanna talk to you. - What about? - [Mestizo] He want to buy spirits. - Oh, you want some brandy, do you? You know it's against the law? - No, not brandy, excellency... - Government beer isn't good enough for you? I could have you arrested. - Well, of course, excellency... - Whoa now, I'm not a hard man, I like to oblige my fellows if it's within my power and does no harm. You understand these drinks come to me quite legally. - Of course. - And I have to charge you what they cost me? - Of course. - Otherwise I would be a ruined man. Are you a talker? - I know how to keep a secret. - Oh, I don't mind you telling the right people. There we are, I can spare you that, it's good stuff. - I wasn't really looking for a brandy, excellency. - You must take what comes. - Then, in that case, I would rather have my 15 pesos back. - 15 pesos? Why you... - Okay, I'll give it to you, but he's got 14 pesos more. - Well now, wine is difficult to get, we have to keep it out of the hands of the priests, you know? - I know, excellency. Perhaps I could have one bottle of brandy, and then one bottle of wine? - Well, wine costs more. - How much? - That will be another 14 pesos, 29 pesos for the two. - Real wine. - Oh, I always give my customers satisfaction. - Oh, thank you, excellency, thank you very much. - [Mestizo] Hey. - [Merchant] (whistles), aren't you tasting? - If your excellency will do me the honor... - Well, why not? That damn government beer downstairs, it gives me the gripe. - A glass of brandy, excellency? - No, I can't stand the stuff, but now wine, that's good for the blood. - But I was keeping that for a present. - Oh, come on. - All the better, don't you wanna try it first? Hm-mm. - No, I'd prefer brandy, actually. - Oh, prefer brandy. - Oh. - Hey, salut. - Salut. - Salut. - Salut. - You know, if I say so myself, that's not bad. - So is your brandy, very good, won't you... - Oh yes, brandy's fine if you like it, but I prefer the wine. Here, won't you try a little? - No, I told you, I was keeping it for a present. - Oh, it's a present for a girl? - No, my mother. - Ah, well you see, she knows what's good for her, you drink wine, you never get boils, you know that? - No, excellency. - That's true, this morning I was shaving, and I noticed one coming out right around here, so I think I will just have a little more medicine. Where your mother live? - Yucatan. - Oh, mine lives in Mexico City, so I don't see her so much, but all the same, it's good to have someone, you know what I mean? - Yes, it is good to have someone. - And a mother means more than a father. - Wait a minute, this is not your wine, where are your manners? My friend, I insist. - No, no, your brandy is so good. - Wait, what was I saying? Ah, mother, yes, mothers mean more than fathers, you can't deny that, and I can honestly say without fear of contradiction, my mother is an angel. Of course, nowadays angels are illegal, but you know what I mean. - I had a mother once. - Who in the hell asked you? - Nobody. - Then shut up, you're drunk. (door knocking) - [Chief] Anyone in? - That's the chief of police. No, no, no, it's all right, it's all right. Come in, come in. Well, how's the toothache? - Damn dentist, he's the...

(thunder booming) - Ah, there go those lights again. - That's bad news for my men. - What is? - The rain's coming so early, they're chasing some damn priest, oh, he might get away. - Oh, with decent luck, he'll starve or die of fever. - I hope so, poor man, this is all you've got? - Well, beer's getting scarce, - Mustn't waste it, then. - Ah. - Same for you? - I prefer brandy. - Salut. - Salut. - Now, what were you talking about? - Mothers, I was saying mine's an angel. - Mine's underneath one. - Underneath what? - An angel, Italian marble, cost me 4,000 pesos, every anniversary I take a wreath, I miss her. Say what you like, a mother's a necessity. - Doctors would agree. - I can remember my grandmother. - How would you know where she was? - I remember my first communion, I still have a photograph of it, my communion, me all dressed up, my sister in her veil, standing in the garden, surrounded by my parents. - How many did you have? - Two. What? - Well, you said surrounded, you'd have to have at least four or five. (group laughing) (thunder booming) - Oh, sorry, it' your beer, isn't it? - It doesn't matter, excellency. - What are you crying for? - Nothing, nothing, it's the brandy, it always does this to me. - Well, I offered you some of this. - I was keeping it for you, excellency. Forgive me, I get drunk very easily, and then when I do, I see... - See what? - All the hope of the world draining away. - My friend, you're a poet. (thunder booming) All the hope of the world draining away, I like that. A poet is the soul of his country, a poet is the real excellency, the excellency of excellencies, the god of all gods, a poet is... (suspenseful music) Where in the hell is he? - Oh my... - [Merchant] Where do you think you're going? - Well, I've got to find him. - Why? - Well, I don't trust him. - [Chief] I don't trust you. - [Merchant] You'd sell your grandmother for a peso. - I wouldn't. Really, I would not. Oh, you just don't understand. - [Officer] Hey, hey, (speaks in foreign language). What's that you got there, huh?

Lemonade. - Lemonade. (suspenseful music) Hey, hey... - Hey. - [Officer] Stop!

All right, follow me. - Please, could I have a drink of water? - [Officer] Tomorrow morning, you've had enough to drink for tonight. - Hey, look out, can't you? Get away from the bucket, you wanna drown us? - Imagine, even in here, like animals. - What's the matter, your highness? Jealous? - Is that you, Katarina? - No, not Katarina. - She will never come. - Is she your wife? - I have no wife. - Oh, why ask him questions? The old man is crazy. - Daughter? - Yes, but she will never come. - She loves you? - It is a priest, the priest that did it. - Priest? - They took the child away from him. - Why? - It was a bastard, they acted quite correctly. - Bastard. - [Prisoner] They said he was no fit father. - They were bad priests to do a thing like that. - [Prisoner] They know what's right. - No, the sin was over, they should preach love. - You don't know what's right, the priests know. - I'm a priest. - What did you say? - [Together] He's a priest. - You shouldn't have told them, there're all sorts here, thieves, murderers. - That doesn't make us informers. - There's no need for anyone to inform on me, when it is daylight, they will find out by themselves. - They'll shoot you. - Yes. - Well then, you're a martyr. - Martyrs are good men, I'm a bad man and a bad priest, I'm what you call a whiskey priest, you know why I'm here? I had a bottle of brandy. - Well, a little drink, father, it's not so important. - Little drink. Once I was so drunk I baptized a boy child with the name Carlota. (group laughing) And I have a daughter. - A daughter? - A bastard. - There was Barabbas, the good thief. - My child, he repented, I haven't repented, I'm not sorry. There is a reward for me, 700 pesos. - Nobody here wants blood money. - That was stupid to tell them, they're all thieves and murderers here. - Why are you here? - I had holy books in my house. (prisoner laughing) Will you hear my confession? - Not here, my child, there is no silence, no secrets. - It's been such a long time. - No, make an act of contrition and trust in God to make allowances. - Dear God, I am sorry for having offended thee. - We're all sinners here, all. I, right now, I want a drink, I want a drink more than anything, more than God, that is a sin. - Now I see what kind of a priest you are, if your bishop knew. - My bishop is a long way off. - He's the only priest we have, so let him alone. - When I get out of here, I shall write to him. - Try not to be angry, try to pray for me instead. - Pray for you? The sooner you're dead, the better. - 700 pesos, don't you want money? You rob for it, you kill for it, and here it is with no trouble at all. 700 pesos, you could divide it amongst you, will no one be my Judas? - You better try to get some sleep, father, soon it will be morning. (calm orchestral music) Let's go, everybody out! Come on, come on, come on, wake up, get up. Come on, come on, what are you waiting around for? Come on, get out in the yard! Go on, move, move, come on! - Yeah, did you have a nice sleep, smuggler? - Not really. - Good, that'll teach you not to like brandy too much. Wait a minute, wait a minute, you have to work for your night's lodging, you know? Take this and the pales from the other cells and empty them out into the yard. And don't spell any, this place thinks enough as it is. Come on, what are you waiting for? Over there, over there! Come on, get moving! (suspenseful music) - Hey, wait a minute. Hey, what are you doing here? They know who you are? - They caught me with the brandy, did they arrest you too? - Me? Oh, no, no, no, I am a guest here, a very important guest. - Why? - Because I have information they need. - Oh, I see, you made a deal with them. - Oh no, no, no, no, not like this. Everything go wrong now, why you let them catch you? It looks crooked to me. - I'm sorry? - I am the one who's supposed to find you, who's gonna get the reward if they already catch you? The chief of police, I suppose, or that filthy sergeant. - There is also the red shirts. - What red shirts? - The ones who caught me. - Oh Santa Maria, not one centavo for me. - I expect they will give you something. - Something, oh no, why should I not have it all? No, they don't know who you are yet. - Not yet. - Well, don't you tell them, not until the right moment, do it for my sake, father. - For your sake? - You wanna get caught, don't you? And I am a poor man who has never had a chance. - Not for you. - Do it for me, father. - For anyone, but you. - A poor man who's never had a chance? You are a priest, aren't you? I implore you... - What's the trouble here? - Please, I wish to see whoever is in charge. - Very well, that can be arranged, follow me. Sir, prisoner requesting an interview. - [Lieutenant] All right. - If you please, sir, I am... - Yes. Now, what is it, what do you want to tell me? Have I seen you before? - You took a hostage from my village. - You had a daughter, huh? What are you doing in the city? - I came to buy tools. - And you spent all the money on drink, and now you have now you have no money to pay your fine, what are you going to do? - God knows. - God knows, God knows, you people are all alike, when are you going to learn that God knows nothing? Back home, you planted your crops yet? - The soil is very bad between the mountains and the marshes. - Well, go across the mountains, the soil in the next state is very good. - Everybody's always telling me to go away. - Well, take their advice. Now, how will you get food on the way home? - I have begged before. - Well, we will have no beggars in this state. Here, you take this, if there's any leftover, you buy a bit of chocolate for your daughter. - You mean I can go? - Now, get out of here, tramp! Don't let me see your face again. - I think I will try the other side of the frontier. Lieutenant, you are a good man. (suspenseful music) - Hey, hey wait a minute, you forgot this. (guitar music) (suspenseful music) (peaceful music) (suspenseful music) (curious music) - The child, the little girl, where is she? - Fever, muerte. (peaceful music) - Come back, come back, in grief he cried, across the stormy water. (dramatic music) (gunshots booming) (suspenseful music) (woman whimpering) (curious music) No, don't be afraid, I'm a priest. Tell me what happened. - The soldiers come, fight with gringo. - I heard the shots, but the child. - Gringo, like this. - He used her as a shield? I'm sorry, she's dead. (woman wailing) There's nowhere to bury her, give her to me. (dramatic music) Rest eternal grant unto her, oh Lord, let light perpetual shine on her, may she rest in peace, amen. (dramatic music) - Who are you? - Kill me, kill me now if you want, or a soldier, tell a soldier I'm a priest. - Priest? But father. - No, leave me, I can give myself up, I don't want to trouble anybody. So is this a barracks? Where are the soldiers? - Father, you are the first priest who has come here in...

I mean, considering we're out of practice. - (spits). - Oh, come Senor School Master, enjoy yourself, it's a holiday you weren't expecting. - Oh, you think it's a holiday for me to see the children go back 1,000 years? Now that we have a priest here, there won't be a week where the school isn't closed for some ascension of something something. Have you done your lessons? Recite the theorem of Pythagoras. - I don't know, master. - [School Master] I want you to know it by tomorrow. - Yes, I will. - I'll watch you. - You're too hard on him. - Maybe you'd rather have a priest teach them, hmm? Peter and Paul instead of Pythagoras, they'll be able to recite the Credo but not able to measure their fields. - My children, are you happy to come to church? - [Crowd] Yes, father. - The procession went well, didn't it? - [Crowd] Yes, very well. - How wonderful to see a mass without fear in church, with candles, bells, a real alter, and vestment such as these, how fortunate you preserved them. - Oh, father, we knew someday a priest would come. - [Delgado] It was a miracle you got across the frontier. - Yes, yes, I think it was a miracle. - You were the only priest in the state? - Yes. - Then why didn't you stay? - It's easy enough to talk. - [School Master] Wasn't it your duty to stay? - You forget that a priest's first duty sometimes must be to remain alive. - Yes. - That's right. - You think I crossed the frontier for no reason? You know nothing of what goes on over there, even the bishop is uninformed, I must report to him and we must sit down together and organize, organize for the future. - Yes, father. - These plans must be made, you understand what I'm saying? - You mustn't blame him, father. - Of course, I mustn't expect wisdom from the cynical. (crowd laughing) So you see, my children, I must leave. - No. - But, father... - It's been pleasant here, but I must now continue my journey to las Casas. - But, father... - Of course he must leave, in las Casas the church is still rich, cathedral with gold leaf. - It's only paint. - [Delgado] When, father? - I have till tomorrow. - [Crowd] Tomorrow? - But father, I two children to be baptized. - I have three. - And there are others. - I will do them in the morning, pass the word around, and it will be two pesos each. - Two? We are very poor, father. - So is the church, my friend. - [School Master] We charge them nothing for school. - I have to travel to las Casas, payment for the horse, payment for board and lodging, payment, payment, payment. - [School Master] Payments (spits). (crowd chattering) - How many baptisms will there be? - In the whole town, there will be nearly 100. - 100, how lovely, 200 pesos, now, let me see. 1.50 each. - One peso, father. - Nope. - 1.50. - Tell everyone to bring their children in the morning. - All right. - Yes, father. - And the money. - I'll tell them, father. - When you get through with the baptisms, father, come and have breakfast at my cantina? - Why not? - And we'll have a little something for the road, hey (laughs)? - Why not? (peaceful music) - You're gonna like las Casas, father, that's a real town, electric lights, street cars, two hotels, and the cathedral is so big, you could put this whole village inside it. - After 10 years of my kind of life, I must say, I'm looking forward to it. - Will you try some of this, father? It's good stuff. - Salut. - Salut. It's very good. - Why don't you take a few bottles with you on your journey, say, a dozen bottles for 60 pesos? - You forget how poor I am. - Oh, father, you've just done 100 baptisms at two pesos each. - 1.50. - Well, even so. - Anyway, I don't need a dozen bottles. - Well, let's say six bottles at 5 pesos each, that's 40 pesos. - 30. - Oh, I tell you what, six bottles for 25, 25 pesos, it's a sacrifice, I'd be losing money on the deal. - Then why do you sell? - Because between you and me, father, that isn't strictly true. (both laughing) - Your horses are ready, father. - Oh, Victorio, bring a saddlebag, we have something to pack. - Let's see, here is 10, 15, 25. - [Delgado] Right, I go get them ready. - Father, I've brought you a gift, a little farewell present from all of us. - Oh, you should not have spent your money on me. - Open it, open it now. - Oh, playing cards. - Oh, not for gaming, father, for tricks, when you get to las Casas, you can do the wonderful tricks for the people there, like you did for us, and they will love you as we love you. - God bless you, my child. - Goodbye, father. - Goodbye. (suspenseful music) Somehow I'm not surprised. I had a feeling I should see you again. Well, did you bring the soldiers with you? - Oh, what a thing to say, father. - [Priest] What trick are you playing now? - Well, you shouldn't say things like that. - [Priest] No. - No, I am here on an errand of mercy. - Of what? - Oh, father, you see, you are the only priest this side of las Casas, and a man is dying. - What man? - Well, the gringo, the murderer the soldiers are looking for. - He wouldn't need me. - Oh yes, father, he's a good Catholic and he is dying, and you and I would not like to have on our conscience what that man must have on his. - We shall be lucky if we have not worse. - What do you mean? - He has only robbed and killed, he has not betrayed his friends. - Goodbye, father. - Safe journey. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, good people. - Where're you going? - Las Casas. - Yeah, fine priest you are, your bishop should hear of this, a man is dying and wants to confess, and just because you are anxious to get to the city... - Why do you think me such a fool? You think I don't know why you're here? You are the only man who can recognize me and they can't follow me into this state, and now if I ask you where this American is, you will tell me he's just the other side of the frontier. - Oh no, father, he is just this side. - You're lying. - Oh, father, I admit a lot, but I am a good Catholic, father look, hey, he sent a message. - For Christ's sake, father, come. - [Mestizo] There's blood on it. You don't trust me. - No. - You gonna tell your bishop? - Tell him what? - When you get to las Casas, you're gonna tell your bishop you refused to give confession to a man dying in moral sin. - Lies, all lies. - No, father, no, look, I was with him when the police find him, look, he pick up a little girl, he hold her in front of him. - What happened to the little girl? - [Mestizo] He's killed, father, oh, but he's only an Indian. - If I were to go back, would the man still be alive? - I think so, father. (dramatic music) - Senor School Master, if I leave a gift, will you spend it on things that do no harm? I mean, food, blankets, not books, hey? - They need food more than they need books. - There should be more than 100 pesos there. - Hey, what are you doing? - And you can sell those back to Delgado. - Go along, run along now. - Conscience money? - Yes. - All the same, I thank you, it's good to see a priest to the conscience, it's a stage in evolution. - Oh, what did you do that for? - I won't be needing money anymore, will I? (dramatic music) Here? - He was there when I left. - Well, he could not move, could he? My son. - Beat it, father. - So you are alive, are you? We better hurry, we haven't much time. - Beat it, father. - You sent for me, you are a Catholic. - Get the hell out of here. - How long since your last confession? - Not 10 years, I guess, look father, you better get out of here. - Not now, the sooner your confession is done, the sooner I will be gone. - No, don't bother about me, I'm through. - You mean damned? - Yeah, damned. - Now, you listen to me, I've come to hear your confession, do you not want to confess? - No. - Did you when you wrote that note? - Maybe, now... - I know what you're trying to warn me of, I know, I do understand, now you let that be, just remember, you're dying, don't depend too much on God's mercy, he has given you this one chance, he may not give you another. - Father, take my gun, and clear out of here. - No, I haven't any use for any gun. - You will have, here. - Now, now, you lie still, it isn't there. - Oh... - No, no, try to remember, you believed once, now you have murdered many people, that may not be so important, it only belongs to this life after all, a few years and it is over, now you can drop all of that here, now, and you can go on forever. - You don't worry about me, you look after yourself, father. - No, no, no, no quick, no, (speaks in foreign language). Oh merciful God, after all he was thinking of me, it was for my sake he didn't confess. - You finish? - I wanna thank you. - For what? - For leaving me alone with him. - I'm not a barbarian. - [Officer] Lieutenant. - [Lieutenant] Yeah? - It's starting to rain. - Well, take shelter, we'll wait till it's over. I must ask you not to try to escape. - I've had enough of escaping. Are you going to shoot me now? - No, you'll be tried first. - For what? - Treason. - You mean I have to go all the way back? - All the way back. You know, I would swear somewhere... - Oh yes, you have seen me twice, the first time you came to take a hostage from my village, you asked my daughter, Who is your father? She pointed at me and said Him. - Sit down over here, away from the door. So you have a daughter, huh? - Yes. - You, a priest? - There are good priests and bad priests, it's just that I am a bad one. - Perhaps we'll be doing your church a service. You said I've seen you twice? - I came to your jail, you gave me money. - What an appalling mockery to have had you and let you go, keep your hands in sight. - Oh, it's only... May I? - You're afraid, huh? Now what? - Oh, just a few playing cards to pass the time. - Hey, why did you come back across the frontier, wasn't the trap obvious? - Oh yes, it was, but it was not you that sent it. - [Lieutenant] Who then? - I have dreamed for a long time of being at peace with God and with myself, now I am, except for this appalling fear. - You have the satisfaction of becoming a martyr. - Mm-mm, martyrs are strong men, were it not for this, I would be on my knees right now, begging for life. - You know I had five men shot because of you? My own people, I wanted to give them the whole world. - Perhaps that is what you did. - That's priest talk. What has your church ever done for the people of this country, huh? You ever excommunicate a landlord for whipping his peasant? Oh yeah, in the confession room, you would probably say to him, Oh, you must repent, my son. So then he invites you to dinner and it's your duty not to know he's just kicked a man to death, and we have ideas too, no more money for saying prayers, and no more money for building places to say prayers in. - Now, listen to me, I'm not as dishonest as you think, when I tell people they are in danger of damnation, I'm not telling them any fairy story I don't believe in myself. I have served God worse than any man in this state, and if there is one man to be condemned, then I must be standing beside him on that final day, I don't wanna be different, I want justice, that is all. - And I want justice too, but I want it here and now. We teach people to read, we give them food, we see that they don't suffer. - And yet you suffer all the time. - For what? - At this moment, I believe, for me. (suspenseful music) - Now you listen to me, I don't like to kill people, not even priests. Pain now, what's it gonna matter in 100 years? - Yeah. - Aren't you gonna argue? - I agree. - It's odd that you and I should agree. - Lieutenant, lieutenant. - What do you want? - [Officer] The rain has stopped. - Dig a hole for that, saddle a horse for the prisoner. - Lieutenant. - Yes. - You have seen many people shot, people like me, does it hurt for a long time? - Only a second. - A second, how long is a second? - [Advertiser] Selecting the right electronic impulses from the sky and transforming them into sound and pictures, requires many sensitive tubes and parts working perfectly. When you turn on an ordinary TV set, cold tubes are hit with hot blasts of power, they suffer from shock, eventually weaken and burn out, you call a service man. But Motorola cuts service calls by protecting its tubes with the exclusive golden tube sentry unit, it holds back sudden jolts, eliminates the major cause of tube failure by letting tubes warm up gradually, this gives tubes longer life, ends three out of four service calls. Motorola and only Motorola gives a full year written guarantee on tubes and parts in every set. Instead of the usual 90 days. This reliability is built into many different consoles, table models and portables, in many different finishes and styles, many with remote control. Here's a portable with full Motorola reliability that sells for less than $170, and this console, believe it or not, sells for less than $230, there are beautiful TV sets with matching stereo Hi-Fi, in a choice of authentic period cabinets by Drexel. From out of the sky come complicated electronic impulses, most reliably transformed into the clearest of pictures and sound by Motorola TV. (singing in foreign language) - [Lieutenant] I suppose you're praying for a miracle. - Excuse me, what did you say? - I said, I suppose you're praying for a miracle. - Oh, no. - You believe in them, don't you? - Yes, but it would not be very wise of God to keep me alive. - I brought you something. - Isn't it against the law? - We make allowances for the dying. Better? - Thank you. - There's something I don't understand. Years ago, why did you of all people stay when the others ran away? Was it love of God? - I would like to think so, but I am afraid it was a sort of pride. - Your God doesn't seem very grateful, the man's served me as well as you served him, I seem to have got a promotion, I'll get my reward. - Yeah, I'm sure you would, lieutenant, you're a good man. All your comrades, for instance, your chief of police, is he like you? - We have our bad men, just as you have yours. - Yes, but there is this difference, you have to have good men, you can't do without them, you will never achieve your ends unless you have them, but there will not always be good men in your party, what happens then? All the old crookedness and cruelties, the starving, beating, get rich quick, anyway, anyhow, just as before. Whereas, it doesn't matter that I am a cowered and a drunkard and all that, I can put God in a man's mouth, just the same, I can give him God's pardon, it wouldn't matter to that man if every priest in the church were as bad as me. - You might as well know, you've been tried and found guilty. - When? - Tomorrow morning. (dramatic music) But listen, you're not such a bad fellow, is there anything I can do for you? - Please give me permission to confess. - There's no priest. - Padre Jose. - He's no good to you. - Is it likely I will find anyone better? (dramatic music) - This man, this priest, he's been working secretly for years for your church, he's suffered, he's been haunted, and now he's gonna be shot. - It's my duty. - But you are not a priest anymore, taking care of me, that's your duty. - I swear to you no one will know. - It's impossible. - [Woman] Come to bed, Jose. - Tell him I will pray. - He won't come. - You mean not tonight? - I mean he won't come at all. - He was afraid, I suppose. Poor man. - You want some more brandy? - No, thank you, I'm quite drunk already. - Listen father, everybody got to die sometime, doesn't matter so much when. - You are a good man, you have nothing to be afraid of. - You have such odd ideas. - God, will you be offended if I speak into your ear directly? There is no one to absolve me now, no one to hear the words that give the spirit rest. I have served you badly, I've been a very mockery of service, the people in this state deserved a saint, you did not send them one, for some reason, which I cannot understand, you sent them me. Oh God, I am very sorry, I beg pardon for my sins, I've been useless, and I just as well never have been born, but if my life has had no meaning, let my death not be the same, let it be an atonement, so that when your torch shall be rekindled in more worthy men, may it burn a little for me too. I thank you, God, for your grace and love, be with me at the end (dramatic music) - Father. - Get out of here, you're done with God. - Father. - What do you want? - Your blessing. - What's the good of that? You can't sell a blessing. - Oh all right, it's just that you and I will not see each other again, father, and I do not want you going out there. - You go home and pray, and then if you have the grace to feel sorry, you give away the money. - Money, what money? There you go again. (men grunting) - [Officer] Attention! - Put this over your eyes. - If you please. All right. Are you able to stand? - I think so. - Good. - Lieutenant, are your men, do they shoot well, hm? - I'm afraid not always. - Will you, personally... - I promise. (gunshots booming) (gunshot booming) (dramatic music) - [Officer] (shouts commands). - What's the matter? - I had a dream last night, I dreamed I was walking in a long corridor, there's the sound of laughter. The corridor went on forever, there were no doors. - Cheer up, my friend, after all, you just shot the last priest. - The priest has more lives than I have bullets in my gun. I shot him a year ago, I shot him again last June, I killed him twice in the winter, and again today.
