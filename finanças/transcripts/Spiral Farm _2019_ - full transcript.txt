Breathing in through the nose, hold for four. And release through the mouth. Let's do that again. Breathing in. Hold. One last time. I just want to express gratitude to all those who work so hard to make this community what it is. It's no secret that our neighbors aren't happy with our way of life. They say that it brings their property values down, that we invite bad people into the space. This is an attack on our way of life. It's not easy to live this way. And I just want to acknowledge all of us that have made this choice to live intentionally. Aho. Aho. Let's be grateful. This present day is a gift. So, let us receive it. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty. And when you use it, you break it open and it's all soft inside. ..Most from one another essentially calls for boundaries that exist only in our mind. As we know, all supportable structures are rigged and they lost a large amount... You haven't been to morning meeting all week. I can't find those Oreimos pieces. You know, the one from Symbiosis. People seem to like those. Di, this is serious. We need cohesion above all else. Oh what, are you accusing me of not being cohesive? What? Never mind. Thought you didn't sell on Fridays. It's just by the road... They're planning a ceremony tonight. That'll be nice. I was just gone a week. Come on, did you miss me? Oh come on, like this much? I missed you this much. You're so tiny. What are we playing? I like golf. Oh. Oh, yes. Hey. Hey. Um, I got you something from the city. Really? Yeah, it's in my bag over there. Oh. It's a fossil. A CD? Yeah. You're going to like it. My friend burned it for you on his computer, old computer Old computer thing? Yeah, so you have to listen to it because it's rare. I will, thanks. Hi, Di. Help me set up at the end of the road, girls. Why are you doing a whole thing if you're just going to the end of the road? Hello? I just don't think it makes any sense. Hita, come on. I have to prepare for ceremony tonight. Oh, how many people does it take to shut up Akiva. Calm down, I'm going to help you. We could bring Ocean. Ocean! ¶GRACEFUL DRUM BEAT¶ ¶HIP HOP MUSIC¶ Oh my god. Hita, Hita. That's my daughter. Ah, hita. Hello, welcome. So nice to meet you. Come on down. This is Theo, my son. Hello. This is it. Oh, so show them where to put their offering for the ceremony. Oh. Follow me. So we can pack, then? Mm-hmm. It's just kids. And she just invited them to ceremony without consulting anyone. I mean, we are supposed to practice generosity... She just always has to be inappropriate, that's her thing. She knows that she can't just invite people to this and especially with everything that's going on. I mean, you're supposed to seek counsel for things like this. How does he know Di anyway? They used to date before I was born. And that's his son? Yeah. Hi. Hey. Where's my bowl? Over there. Oh. How old is he? I don't know. Our age, I guess. Is he doing ceremony? Ocean. No. Come on. You have to. I don't know. So you don't like him? No. Yeah, right, her panties have been soaking wet since he got here. Jesus, Sasha! So sorry you don't wear panties. I don't know. I really don't. Well, I'm just going to have to see if I have a connection with him. Yeah, I thought you mostly liked women. Sexual energy's complicated. No, I know. Di, are you coming? I think she left. Can I have pistachio? Yeah. Are you coming? No. ¶RHYTHMIC DRUMMING¶ Miracle. Are you having any tonight? Are you? I might. Mm-hmm. How can you not think he's cute? When Soleil and I opened our doors 22 years ago, we didn't know what Spiral Farm was. We wanted to create a space that was different from the world outside. Place of understanding, place of acceptance. We wanted to change the world and we started in our own back yard. And as we get ready to dive into this incredible journey, this mystical adventure, set an intention for what you would like to get out of tonight. What would you love to receive from this amazing, beautiful ritual? My intention tonight and every day is to just get in touch with my true self, my core, true being, who is love. To facilitate the best in each one of you. To present me with new possibilities so that I may continue down a divine path. To gain the strength to follow my passions and to grow with all of you. ¶SPIRITUAL CHANTING¶ ¶BOHEMIAN VOCALS¶ ¶Earth my body, water my blood¶ ¶air my breath and fire my spirit¶ ¶Earth my body, water my blood¶ ¶air my breath and fire my spirit¶ ¶Earth my body, water my blood¶ ¶air my breath and fire my spirit¶ ¶Earth my body, water my blood¶ ¶air my breath and fire my spirit¶ ¶Earth my body, water my blood¶ ¶air my breath and fire my spirit¶ ¶Earth my body, water my blood¶ ¶air my breath and fire my spirit¶ ¶Earth my body, water my blood¶ ¶air my breath and fire my spirit¶ ¶Earth my body, water my blood¶ ¶air my breath¶ ¶and fire my spirit¶ ¶Earth my body, water my blood¶ ¶air my breath¶ ¶and fire my spirit¶ Hey. Hey. Is Ocean asleep? Yeah. Good. I did do Di's food duty this morning, that was cool. Why am I not surprised? Yeah, she just didn't show but she was probably getting her brains screwed out last night. Yup. We all understand once you start to need it. Sex, that is. What makes you think I haven't had sex? You're still a virgin. I'm not. I'm not talking about this with you. My god, Hita, you're so annoying. I'm not annoying. You're annoying. Yes, you are. Don't be so closed off. So did you set an intention for ceremony yesterday? Yes. For you to fucking show up. Sweetie, you have to see intentions for yourself, not for other people. That's why it didn't work. Mm, That smells good. But don't smoke it all, okay? Please? You smell good. You smell like dick. And I covered your shift this morning, so you owe me. Okay. Oh, Di. Can I just put this down over here? Oh, I got it. Thanks. Do you know if you've been added to the chore wheel? No, I don't think so. Well how long are you guys staying for? My dad said we'll be here until through the end of the week. Mm-hmm, I will speak to Pete about that, I'm sure we can find, we can find some ways for you. Right on. There's a piece of hay in your hair. Maybe you can dry. Cool. Oh. Di? Mm-hmm Is everything okay? You know Sash. What happened? Same thing always happens. She's just upset. You barely know them. And now they're staying here? The second anything goes wrong for Sash, she runs. Not you. You like Mau.. Right? Sure. I like his hands. And his uh what, his smile and drugs. Okay. Hita. Will you please do the stables for me? I traded with Sash, but she's done a runner. Hey. I'm supposed to show you how to clean the stables. For sure. Give me a second. My dad really likes your mom. Di's relationships usually don't last longer than a week. You should be on your way soon. You need help? No, I got it. You know, I just met my dad like last year. I don't know my dad, so... Yeah. Dads kind of suck. Yeah. Can you get that wheel barrel? Where do you want it? Right here. Now this is the fun part. You get to scoop up their shit. Yee-haw! What are you doing? What do you mean? You lean. Come on. And then. What did I do wrong? You got to kick it. Oh. Like this? Yep. I saw you with Miracle last night. She's basically a lesbian. You know that, right? Miracle? Yeah. I guess she likes you because you've got feminine features. I wouldn't expect much of it. How do you know that? She's my best friend, tells me everything. ¶HIP HOP MUSIC¶ ¶ GUESS WHAT HAPPENED?

Oh my god, you would've loved Studio 54. Did you see Studio 54? Oh, sure did. You were there? Oh yeah. It was pretty crazy because you'd take Quaaludes and things and listen to music. Have you ever done a Quaalude? Well... no. I know people who have, but... I'm sorry you missed that. He's 18, you know? I was a heavy, heavy addict and very destructive. But now, I'm a pacifist, just like your dad. Yeah. Oh Theo, my god, you have you have an aura that is emanating from you. Yeah, he's the gentle kind, you know? I've told him as men, we have to teach the young generation how to be more gentle with women that would, you know... You know, if men stopped thinking about the thought of how we must treat women, I think it would be much better. Because basically, no one can imagine what another human being let alone a woman desires. Really, Sasha? What? Okay, now you can't do it. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, don't do that. You're so cute whenever anyone sexualizes anything in front of you. No, I'm not. Yes, you are, you just... Do you remember that guy that used to live here on Spiral Farm, the one that went and watched all the girls in the showers. Oh god... - Randy? Yes, yes. What do you mean, it was his job to watch? No, no, no, he would just creep in and watch little girls in the showers, he was harmless, truly harmless but it was weird a little. And it was, I think, at that moment, that our Hita developed this bashfulness. That's not true at all. Is that what happened? My brother was molested by a neighbor. Why are you laughing? I'm not laughing. Hey hey hey, lets be serious, you know this is- I'm not laughing, its just weird that I said that. Hi, Ocean! Hi. Do you like your dinner? You don't. Take the tomato off of his plate. She's the funny one. You sure look good, Hita. Ow! I like them. I'm just kidding. I think that that. Is going to charm your man one day. Thank you. Everybody is insane. You're just noticing that now? I have to go to the city tomorrow for a couple days, I have a gig. You just got here, Sasha. Well, I have work. And I'm not comfortable here. What do you mean? There's nowhere for me to sleep or to put my stuff, or to have space. Well, sleep in my room and put your stuff there. That's not the point. What's the point then? I just don't, I don't fit here. We're hanging, living at a farm. Yeah, living on the farm? Yes. At a miracle farm. Indeed. So our parents are fucking. Is it cool if I sleep here tonight? Yeah, you could sleep on the couch, I guess. I'm going to take Di's bed. That's perfect, that's perfect. What's that, what are you packing for?

I don't like to see her like that, you know? She just cares about her jewelry, nothing else. And Hita, what are you into? She's a dancer. Really? - No, I'm not. Yeah, you are. What kind of dance? You know, like hip-hop- Shut up. The stuff that goes like That's cool. Hey Hita, you dropped this. Figured you might want it back. Give this back to me... What's it, a flyer? Hey, why so secretive? What is that? Can I see it? No. It's mine. Come on. Oh, dance auditions tomorrow. Let me tell you something, Hita, I wish somebody had told me. When you have a passion in life, you got to follow it, all right? It's just something I do for myself- No no no. You can make this happen if you want to. Theo, didn't you have to drop off those forms at school? Yeah. It's supposed to be a couple days ago, but we can go tomorrow. That's settled, all right? You guys, will leave town tomorrow. I know you're mad at her, but at least say goodbye. No. Hi, Ocean. What's up? Come on, don't be sad, you always do this when I leave and you're fine as soon as I'm gone, you know that. You know what? I'm doing this for you. I promise. Even if it doesn't seem like it.

Okay. Be good, okay? Ocean, I got to go, I have an appointment, and I'm going to be late. Ocean, come on, please don't do this right now This isn't funny, I can't really... come on, please. Ocean. Ocean. God your strong. Ocean, come on. Let go. Ocean. Ocean, I got to go. Ocean, let go. Come on. Ocean, let go! ¶HIP HOP MUSIC¶ Did you brush your teeth? Yeah. Really? Mm-hmm Show me. Let me smell your breath. Oh god, go brush your teeth. And be quick. Can you tell me a story? I don't want to tell stories. Why not? Now go to sleep, okay? No. You said if I came down here, you'd go to sleep. No. What happens when you die? Why do you want to know that? Because I just want to know. Well, everything is made of energy, including our bodies. And energy can't be created and it can't be destroyed so even when we die, we go to another place. How do you know that? I just know. I promise you. Do you believe me? Hi. Hey. It's freezing. Yeah. What's the audition for? It's for her dancing. I got to go drop off some stuff at the college I'm going to, so I figured I'd- I just don't know how I'm supposed to feel about this. Just bring her back before dark, okay? Because I got to work and Ocean... Sure. I will. Ocean needs her by him a lot. He doesn't like being without her. It's a body. Are you going? Yup. Here, take this so I can reach you. Hey, Di. You notice anything different? You shaved under your armpits. Yeah. I figure everyone else there would've. You used to not care what other people thought. You're an independent soul. I still am. No. It's sad to see you like this. Like what? I thought you'd be the type of woman that I wasn't. The type to use her brains instead of her... body. Should've instilled that a bit in you. Yeah. I guess you should've. Check on the oil, to make sure the will be fine, you know? You check all the time. All good. All right? Yeah. Hey! Hey. What wrong? I'm just a little nervous. Hey, don't mention it. Your mother's a little sour with me, it's all good. I'm sorry. Tell Ocean I'm going to be back tonight, okay? Don't worry about Ocean. He'll hang out with me. Alright, be safe kids. Yes, sir. I love you, son. Look after your sis, all right? Yeah. All right. Shall we get the fuck out of here? Yes, we shall. Wait, wait! Oh, shit. This is for protection. Thanks, Di. ¶UPBEAT AMBIENT MUSIC¶ Okay. Ten jumping jacks, let's go. What? Oh, shoot. Two, three, four. I'm going to sweat. Let me.

I'm going to need you to sign a few papers and we can just sign that and get you going. What's going on, bro? Can we get two tostadas? Good looks. Thanks, man. I can't believe your school's in the city. Yeah, I'm pretty fucking stoked. I was actually just going to go to um... community college in my hometown, but my new-found father said that he wanted me to have the full college experience. Mm-hmm, it's nice of him You know, if you applied, you could totally get in. It's expensive. To be honest, Maurizio would probably pay for your tuition. You're like family now, practically. Any who... um. Oh my god. You ready to go? No. I don't want to go home. I don't want to go home, either. Do we have to? Come jump. This is our bed for the night. Shoot. Oh! Happy birthday! How can a young man keep his way pure? I wonder how many people had sex in this bed. Probably like 68. You know, after tonight, it's probably going to be 69 you know what I'm saying? Because, I mean, let's face it, you and I, we're not so different, after all. And you know, we get this hotel room all to ourselves, so... no Di, no Sasha... No. Oh, baby, oh baby. Ew, I don't want it. Put your hands all over me. No. No. Get that away from me. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Do you think Maurizio's actually going to help me? What do you mean? Like, if I'd want to go to college and be in the city and... like is that... Don't mess with me, okay? I'm serious, I'm trying to ask you a question. Yeah, I think so. Really? I'm moving to the city, I'm moving to the city, I'm moving to the city, I'm moving to the city, I'm moving to the city, I'm moving to the city, I'm moving to the city, I'm moving to the city. Let's go swimming. You said we'd be out early. The fuck? Get up! I'm back. They're saying by category. I don't think he's owned by the power to be. I don't think that the director controls... I'm sorry. Was Ocean okay? He was with me. Di, I was gone for one day. Sasha goes away all the time. Hita, you know what? I'm going to have you, um rather start off over there and, uh... we'll probably get to that another time, yeah? Theo was saying you're interested in going to college. I thought I wanted to. Let's talk about it. Your mother was mad at me about the audition, but I'd like to help. Are you leaving? I'm not going anywhere. Then why are you packing a suitcase? This is Sasha's stuff, I'm packing Sasha's suitcase. Well then why are you grabbing stuff out of your drawer? Your mom wanted to borrow my clothes. But those aren't even her size. Well, what can I tell you? She wanted my clothes. No she didn't. Yeah, she did. Tickle. You're annoying. Come here. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, ho, ho, ho. Don't, give it. Got you. Ow. Ow. That really hurts, stop! Stop! Jesus... Think you hit my eye. No. And let it out through the mouth. Thank you so much. Thank you. Aho! Now, I'd like to give the floor up to Peace. We'll make some fan material collages, we can even make our own glue if someone found materials here. We can build our own frames, make some artwork. Leaves from the garden. I wouldn't mind doing some painting with them. That would be great. You get the paint the frames after you're done. I read how to make some natural paints out of the plants in the neighborhood. That's great, I could do this mostly online And Hita, do you think you could... with the kids? Yes, no, of course, I could make something. Yeah. Okay, great. She's very gifted- ¶HIP HOP MUSIC¶ Oh, I hear you, Sash! Yes, Di! I'm hungry, is there food? Yeah, we did some salad. Salad... I'm going to go to Vegas next week for a convention. Oh great! Great. Everyone's leaving and going. Oh, God. What's wrong? Well, I feel so bad. How could he? Maurizio's going away for good. Oh, you got dumped by your boyfriend? Yeah. Oh, that sucks. Your sister's leaving, too. What are you talking about? She is. She's going to live in the city with Theo. Or so she thinks. That's ridiculous. Not to her. She hates Theo. Yeah, well... She's not going to make it in the city. She changed her mind. She is in for a world of hurt. Very dramatic. So, Hita moves to the city... and where are you going to live if she leaves? What do you mean? You don't think they'll let you stay here, do you? What is it with this negativity, man? I'm just saying, you think everybody's going to let you stay here if Hita's gone? Think about it. Hey. I'm going to put you to bed. I want HITA to put me to bed. What? She's not fun like me. Don't forget to brush your teeth. We don't brush our teeth, we stay up all night long, yeah! Here we go. It's going to burn. Yeah, it's really strong. Yeah. Okay. You just felt it through all the negative energy, all the things that no longer serve you, that you no longer need in your life, filtered your chakras. Mm-hmm Here, pure soul. Breathe it in, breathe it in, deep breaths. Release. Release, release, release, release, release. Hita says she wants to leave. She needs to be here. I don't trust any of them. I do hear you. Please don't talk to him about death and stuff. Why? He was curious. Because I don't like it. And I'm his mom. It's not easy, you know? What? Life in the city. You might not be at Spiral Farm anymore, Sash. Aren't you concerned about that? Please. Don't be so blasé about it. There's always been something around here, some drama, some threat of extinction, some bad people in the outside world that take away our community. This place fucking loves drama. They need drama to give their life meaning, to give this community a sense of purpose. All the more reason to leave. Hita, as a woman, there will always be men offering to pay for all your shit and to support you and to buy you stuff. And it's your job to recognize when an offer's legit and when it's not legit. And when it's not legit, you fucking walk away. Thank you, Sasha. You really think a perfect stranger that mom manipulated into coming over here and fucking for a few days is going to pay for your college education? And your rent? What are you going to do when Theo starts college? There's going to be a million girls throwing themselves at him. And you're just going to be there playing house? Just let me take you into the city one day and I'll show you what really goes down because it's not some fantasy. I couldn't do what you do. I know you... you wouldn't allow... Hi. Rise and shine. Um, I just need some kerosene. Um... Do you have any? Yeah, probably in the cabinet above the stove. Thank you. So... did you have fun in the city the other day? Yeah. I did, it was nice. It was nice to get out of here for a bit. Yeah, it was nice that you took her. What's that? That's a scar I got skating, bombed the hill and fucking fell really hard. It's a pretty gnarly scar. Very gnarly. Kinda of hot, though. Huh? I said it's kind of hot, though. My first boyfriend used to skateboard. Was he good? Yeah, he was good. I guess he wasn't really my boyfriend, he was the first guy I slept with. I was in middle school and he was in high school. How old were you when you guys had sex? Fourteen. How old were you? I was sixteen. Just turned sixteen. Was she your girlfriend? No. It was a one night stand I met at this party. I had a girlfriend at the time then. Your girlfriend didn't want to sleep with you? No. You didn't pressure her? No. Well I... You're a rare breed. I bet she gave you head a lot, though. Yeah. She gave me head a lot. Girls are weird, man, they think that giving head is less intimate than having sex. No, foreplay is the best part. It's about taking things really slow. And they're going to pain for it. And their toes are curling. You can give them head. Stop. Why? Stop, just... Why? Why not? You're just not who you think you are. Yet. Are you sure? Why not? You leave anyway and then I'm never going to see you again. ¶SOFT PIANO¶ ¶DRUMS AND SINGING¶ ¶POP MUSIC¶
