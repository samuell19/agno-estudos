Well. Hey, man. Are these all your things? Yeah. I'm ready. Checkered shirt. What did you do with the uniform? Careful, I still need to talk to the doctor. I haven't gone to see mom in a while. Can we stop by? So have you quit for good? Well yeah. I need to work on the boat. And you could do with a fix-up too, huh? Huh, huh, huh, huh? Super Mario Brothers back in action? - Huh? - Shut up. And what are you dressed up for? Vacation. Hey, Petya is coming with us too. Get the dog in the house, put all of your essentials here into this bag. You have five minutes. - Go on. - Wait, Maxim. Maxim. A new one? Released in 1994. You change them pretty quick. I'm looking for the best one. I'm so happy to meet you, Petya! Polina. Petya. It's been a while since I've touched, a real girl. Thank you. Petya. Sit in the back, ok? You didn't tell me that she looks so much like mom. You have such an interesting brother. Are you sure that you want to come with us? It's not too late. Yeah. Will you be friends with me? Do you like gum? I'm ecstatic about it. You took a while to arrive. We stopped by the cemetery to see mom. What, did something, happen to her? We have different moms. We're not full brothers. We're step-brothers. Not step-brothers, half-brothers. So you have the same father, right? The same father. Pops and I were born in March. We're seducers. I'm one myself, you know? He's an October boy. Gloomy. I can tell. I'm the merriest one here. Let me sleep on your knees. I'll take a nap too then. Look, I'm driving, with my eyes closed. Look. No, no, no, no. Com on, old boy, let's make it fair. Let me, let me. I'm letting go. No, let me in. Oh, look at those ruins. They're ancient. Like from the Soviet period. What do you know about the Soviet period? Well, it was a really bad time. People were constantly afraid of everything. They went around with suitcases, afraid that everything would be taken from them. You couldn't travel anywhere for vacation. They couldn't even eat decently, Because there was nothing to eat. They had to stand in those lines. My mom used to tell me all about it. In the soviet period, people lived, And people believed. With their own hands, people were building a future for the sake of their children. For the general good, rather than just for the sake of their own skin. What about churches? They destroyed all of them. In the place of those ruins, there were once kindergartens, Sports halls, discotheques. Everything was great! What discotheques? They were called dance halls. Whoa, look at that grandpa. Hey. Could you please direct us to the backwater? To the backwater? - Hello. - Yeah. Hi. What for? We have a boat waiting there, but we got lost a little. We can't seem to get there. Who sold it to you? Are you from the local administration or something? - What's the issue? - No, no, no. You're asking so many questions. I'm just a normal pensioner, What administration? There's only around 20 people left in the village, we all know each other here. Well, the old owner passed away, and everything was inherited by his daughter, But it turned out the daughter didn't need a boat, So she decided to sell it. Something like that. I have all the documents. Want to see them? What for? You don't believe me. Don't worry. We'll get the whole boat fixed up, put it on the water, and we'll let everyone ride in it. You too! Come have tea with us. No, no, no. I'm not going anywhere. It's my sanctuary. Alright, that's fine, but how do we get to the backwater? Oh, the backwater? Drive straight, take a left at the first house, and you'll reach it. Maybe, we should exchange numbers to get in touch. I'm Maxim. Nikolai. Pleased to meet you. But as for phones, none of us have them here. There's no signal. What will I do without signal? I already don't have signal. That sucks. What about Instagram? And how am I supposed to check into anything? Alright, then I guess we won't be in touch. Right. Have a nice trip. Is this it? Huh? An aircraft carrier! How old is it? We'll resurrect it. It'll look brand new. Petya, what's up? Just looking. I say we roll up our will power into a ball, Put some work in, and then rest. Well? It's so dirty. So you can clean it all then. - Me? - Yeah. With what exactly? With your hands. Why don't you give me something - so that it's easier? - I'll give you a scraper. I don't know how to use a scraper. I'll teach you. Petya! You hear? You and I will work on the wiring. I'm going outside, just for a minute. Listen, how about this. Grab the dinghy and go and check the boat for corrosion. What's that? Grab a hammer and tap away around the whole boat. When you hear a hollow sound... - All right, I got it. - Just make a mark. What's with him? What do you mean? Well, he's kind of weird. He's claustrophobic. His mom would lock him into his room when he was little, dad left them and then she went nuts. Other than that, he's a normal guy. Why'd you freeze? I thought I saw something. Why are you scaring him? I was kidding. Don't kid like that. Have you finished everything? Yeah. Why is the porthole dirty? Well it doesn't open. You don't need to open it. Then how will I clean it? Come on, hop on the chair. Now. Stretch out your arm. Can you reach it? Yeah, I can. Now grab the washrag. And go ahead. What's with the face? Nothing, everything is fine. Well. Soldier. Am I not allowed to whine a little? No. Why not? We had an agreement. Okay. I warned you that you weren't fit for this, but you asked to come yourself. Everything is fine, I feel comfortable, Everything is a-OK. You're sure, right? When you're done with the washrag, I'll show you how to use this machine. So I could have used It to wash from the beginning? You see, first you have to become a master of the washrag. To understand the full beauty of working with this wonderful device. I see. I guess my head Isn't working correctly, I need to get some air. I was just kidding, you would have flooded the place. I'm going to take a dip. Where are you gonna do that? Petya! Petya, will you teach me how to swim? Have you finished already? No, I haven't, but I can't continue. What about Maxim? Maxim doesn't wanna swim. Maxim wants to work. Alright then, come down here. Don't be mad at him. He's really demanding on himself too. I remember how at grandpa's wake, when we were small, he was terrified, but he still walked up to the body and kissed his forehead in front of everyone, Not because he loved him that much, But to test himself. Don't be upset. Well? It's not working, is it? Wait. Don't jerk like that, come on, take it easy. Alright, I think you're swimming, I'm letting go. Is it working? Is it working? Well yeah, you're swimming. She's drowning, drowning! Where are you from? From the city? Yeah, from the city. Where else? That's what I thought. You're so pretty. Your legs are so slim and you have such nice arms. Thanks. I've never seen hair like this. Are you planning to sleep on the boat? Well yeah. Where else would we sleep? Aren't you afraid? What's there to be afraid about? Well there was a fire there. So what? There weren't victims though, right? There were. Who? Children that were my friends. Did they die? They're all there now, beyond the horizon. Alright, I'll go now. Or mom will be angry. What's your name? Julia. I'm Polina, that's Petya. It's all nonsense. She's probably crazy. No, really. Ask Petya if you want, I wouldn't make something like this up. It's best not to mix Petya up with such weird people. You look after Petya so well. Like after a son. I wonder, for you to look after me like that, Do I have to become a drug addict? Do you want children? I would bear you a son. For you to take care of. Do you want to conceive him right now? That's not what I meant. What do you have there? A happiness bracelet. What's a happiness bracelet? How does it work? It's easy. Just put it on, make a wish, and then wait for it to come true. Does it work? Dummy. When it comes true, you'll know right away, because I'll take it off. Hmm-hmm. Hey. How can I turn this thing on without electricity? Why did you drag it here anyway? Can't you see I'm working on it? Why don't you throw the junk out from the cabins, just don't wake up Petya. Who's knocking? I thought that you were checking out the hull. Stupid. Meow, meow! It's just the buoy. Petya, fasten it, so that it stops clanging. Petya. Petya. There was a fire here. We're all going to die. Petya. Petya, did you have a good night's sleep? Look at me. Petya. Listen, don't you wanna do something useful? Why don't you make dinner? Give me electricity. We'll have it in the evening. Great! You're such a real man. - What else you want me to do? - Anything, I don't know. Go read a book or something, If you can't find one then look in my bag. What, like a manual on how to scrape walls? What did you say? Come on. Okay, what did you mean by that? Listen, you're a great man of course, if one is looking for self-improvement. Why don't you make a cook out of me, A dishwasher, or a pushover. Do you tame all of your girlfriends like this? No, only those in whom I see potential. But I guess I was wrong about you. Would you like to eat? Not now. Don't be upset, who cares that it's not working out. I love you. Well. There won't be power today. I'll need to try again tomorrow with a clear head. We'll have to do without light. - Maxim? - Hmm? Why don't you love me? Am I really that abhorrent? What do you even need me for? It's just that, I, just want for you to be self-sufficient. A person must work to better themselves constantly. That's all. Where did that come from? A wedding? Maybe we should have some fun? Who invited us? You think someone will be against it? I will. There's no light here, but there is there, why not? Listen, buzz off to your damn wedding if you wan to! No one is holding you here. Alright. I hope you and Petya have a good time. The fire thing is nonsense. I checked today, they had hundreds of ways of getting out of there. If all of them weren't handicapped at the same time. Do you see them too, or have I completely lost it? Who? Them. No, you haven't lost it. I see them too. They look like corpses. Demons. Right, demons. Just some locals. May I warm up at your fire? - Sure. - Of course, join us. Yeah, please. Catching crawfish? Yeah, a little bit. It's better not to catch crawfish here. And not to eat them. Why not? Our backwater attracts dead bodies. And crawfish, love them. What dead bodies? When they were building the reservoir, three villages went under water. So they brought the dead bodies from the whole county here. Now they're here, below. And in the summer, when the water washes away the silt, the crawfish feast on the corpses. And the pike eat the crawfish. And you eat the pike? No. We don't eat the pike. I'd recommend for you to stay away from the water too. Whose barge is that? When they closed the lock, they left it here, on the way, there to the hydroelectric station. People come, party, and leave. We don't have no idea who they are. They don't invite us, and we're not interested anyway. Not interested? What about them, who's there? They seem interested. I think they're watching us. They are guarding their lives, their peace. Guarding. Guarding. Guarding the secret about the dead children? Who told you that? Julia. A girl, you know her? Tell us how it happened. Natalia, Julia's mother, was working as a teacher then, she lost track of the children, And they ran out onto the boat. They were playing there. Perhaps by accident, they started a fire. To roast potatoes. Or maybe they were smoking. A tragic event. I looked over the place where the fire was and it doesn't look anyone was trying to get out. There aren't any signs of that. They didn't have time. Maybe the door was jammed. I looked at the door, it isn't even that burned. In fact, I think that the door was open. Maybe they suffocated. Or there was a short circuit. Carbon monoxide, after all. Short circuit? I found a nail in the panelboard. But it's obvious that it was put there after the fire. Why are you hounding me? You think we didn't rack our brains trying? You think that we took that tragic accident lightly? What about Natalia? What happened to her? She went to jail, as was right. When she was released, the parents really harassed her, they broke her windows, lit her house on fire a few times. Poor thing, she really got it. When they realized that she lost her mind, they stopped. Time passed and everything was forgotten. Why didn't you tell us that the children burned to death? Would you have left? No. That's what I thought. Petya, come on, let's get up. Did Polina come? No. What are we gonna do? Come on, get ready. We'll go see what's over there. Yo! Anyone here? Did they just leave everything here like this? Polina! Anyone here? Oh, look. Attention, battle stations! All hands on deck! What's that? It's her bracelet, of happiness. Polina's? Look, Maxim. I love you, Polina. And now I understand why. Come here. What's this? Explosives? Under the sofa. What for? I think I know what we should do with the dynamite. And what's that? If we don't find Polina, we'll blow everything to hell. What if she's in the city already. To hell with her! I'll dump her. I'm getting so sick of her whims. Is that a child shouting? I think it's coming from there. Hi, guys. Have you seen a girl, from the city, she was at the wedding? No, I haven't. Oh, alright. What is it, meat? Real fresh. Will you sell some for a barbecue? Around five kilograms or 10? Ask Natalia if you want. Where's Natalia? In the house. In that house, right? Let's go, I'll show you. She's my mom. Go on, go. So long. Mom? Momma! Mom, we have guests. What did you come out for? Go in the room, or I'll lock you in. Hi. What do you want? We wanted to buy some pork from you. Around five kilo. For a barbecue. Will you sell it? No. Why not? Meat isn't for eating. Is that all? No, you see, we... We lost a girl, we're looking for her. We wanted to ask, maybe you know where she is? Do you love her? It's his girlfriend, not mine. His? That's a shame. That one doesn't feel anything. You're perceptive. You understand. You know what it's like to lose. Don't be afraid of me, I'm just like you are. We're all like you are, waiting. Everything dies, but love remains. Those who love, will inevitably find each other. Alright, I see. Is there a grocery store around here? Petya. There hasn't been a store around here in years, but I'll give you food. I'll give it to you. She'll give it to you, but not me. Look, there used to be a factory here. There are the children. What're you doing? Stop it. Don't touch! They closed the factory because of a accident. Here, take this. - Thank you. - Now go. Thank you. - Let me pay for it. - No, money isn't necessary. Go now, even better, leave, leave these parts. Petya. Take this, please, Natalia gave us some food. I'll put it here, as your hands are bloody. Could you tell us where we can find Nikolai? Nikolai? Yeah. He's at the cemetery in the evenings. Alright, where's the cemetery? You jumped all over them asking for meat. What happened? I don't know, I lost my bearings. It's just that those people. The guy with the knife, did you see the look in his eyes? He's capable of anything. It's all related somehow. The black backwater, the children, the barge, The vanished wedding, the abandoned factory. At least they gave us vodka. What was that? A cow. - A bull. - Who's here? Demons. Oh, there's demons here too? What did you think, boy? Let's have a drink? Pour it out. What are you doing here? Taking Boris for a walk. At night? At the cemetery? Why not? It's nice here, calm, quiet. Boris likes it. I don't think Boris really cares. Why aren't you pouring him a drink? No, I can't. What's this vodka? Well, you bought a boat. You think that you've filled, the emptiness that's developed, but through your deeds. And your actions, you can't destroy the people that are all around you. Are you saying that I should abandon everything, leave the boat here and go? Life is a very complex equation. You're responsible for more than just yourself and your actions. Nikolai, the whole wedding party vanished. Where did they go? Maybe they drowned. And the lake swallowed them. So that's just how you explain everything? I did warn you, that this place is mysterious. - Mysterious. - Yes. The water is cursed. Nikolai, stop trying to cloud our heads with supernatural nonsense. You don't believe? I don't. University professors believe, doctors of science believe, but you don't. How can I explain it to you? Can you see magnetic waves? No. But you won't start denying that they exist. You believe in them, don't you not? Of course, yeah, how could I not believe in them? The sun crossed the horizon, does that mean that it's gone forever? The sun? What are you getting at? The horizon is too low here. Your girl will come back soon. Just wait. Here! Here you go! Dasha, stand up please, I'll wash the rock. Just like that. Hey what's that? Look. Let's run back to mom, come on. Come on, let's go. Come on, come on. C'mon. Hi. You? Where are the children? What children? I was following the children. There aren't any children here. Why were you so scared? It's as if they were demons, not children. So what's the plan? Back to the boat, or just dilly-dally? I asked if you'd take me to the boat? Or did you have a different plan? - No. - Then let's go. Clouds are a strange thing. You never know when they'll become overfilled with moisture, and release rain. So they carry water above you. Overhanging, scary-like, and then you think: That's it, I'm done. But no, they just flow past you, and turn into rain at the house nearby. Let's swim away from here, Petya. The locals were tossing meat out in the morning. Come out. Someone's here to see you. The vodka was fake. I can't even make a smile. Where are you coming form that's so glamorous? From the other world. I fixed the wiring yesterday. I hope that you fixed it well, and we don't burn like the children. The children didn't burn, at least not on the boat. How do you know? I'm conducting my own investigation. Where were you anyway? You drank so much that you don't even remember? At a wedding. The wedding dragged on for a bit. It's a shame you didn't come. It was a good wedding. The bride's name was Polina too. We became friends and talked all night. Then we went to Yuryevets on jetskis, With Valera, the owner of the barge. Pretty cool. I know. I gathered some apples for you. Try some. I'm okay. Come here, Maxim. They're sweet. To be frank, I don't think your drunkenness benefits your Petya, your drug addict brother. How did you get here? I took a taxi from Yuryevets. A taxi. Valera paid for it? What do you care about Valera? He's a good guy. We had a fun time. Listen, everyone here knows that you're a slut already, you don't need to flaunt it. You're as gracious as ever, Maxim. I'll go elsewhere then. Where to now? Someone's funeral? Someone who you also don't actually know? I'll go to the beach to tan, The atmosphere here is just a bit stuffy, Like in a mausoleum. Ciao. Alright, say hi to Valera. She can go wherever she wants, for all I care. I don't need that kind of responsibility. We'll fix the engine and then take the boat out. - Hey there! - Hi! She's lying. About Valera? I found her on the complete other side. In the reeds. She was playing with some children. She scared the hell out of me. Hi. What're you doing here? Just sitting here, playing. Why aren't you swimming? My mom doesn't let me, it's dangerous. Why don't you come onto the boat with us? We cleaned everything. It's gonna be beautiful soon. I'm not allowed on the boat either. Mom says that people who go there turn into mist. Listen, how come you're not allowed anything? I don't know. How old are you? I'm 20. Here. So you're an adult already, you're free, You can do whatever you want. I think that mom knows best anyway. Let's play. Sit down. We'll make an adult woman out of you yet. Cool. You know, I used to follow fashion too. I had a magazine. But, Uncle Kolya says that everything foreign Is from the devil, you see? Don't believe those men. He says we need to be closer to nature. To feel the earth. To hear the rustling of the leaves. That's nonsense, Julia. Why? Come to our boat today, I'll find you something from my clothes. Look at what eyes you have. What eyes? Each has its own color. No one has eyes like that. They're not different colors, silly. They're just have different shapes. One is human, and the other is cat-like. Like a witch. I'm not a witch. Every woman has a little bit of witch in them. - Wait, stop, Julia! - Wait, mom, stop! - What're you doing? - Momma. You shut up, evil witch. Have you no shame? Put on a skirt at least. Shame! Let's go! Where's the dipstick? Did you check it? We need more. You didn't like it? What? What? What just happened. It was alright, I've had worse. So that's it then, huh, love is gone? What love? You only care about your boat and your brother. We were actually talking. I need to go, get ready. For what? We're going to have guests today. Guests? Yeah, guests. My friend is gonna have dinner with us, a local girl. I'll introduce you. Is it that crazy one? The crazy one, is Petya the drug-addict. Julia is totally okay. People don't become drug-addicts for no reason, Polina. Yeah, I know. Claustrophobia, they locked him up as a kid. Yeah, they did lock him up. One time his mom locked him in, and then hung herself in the other room. He sat in the room and listened to how his mom was croaking on the rope and he couldn't do anything. So sorry, that I have to pull him up. And you know, I think I'm doing well he's getting better. Well then, great, a little celebration won't do him harm then, just like the rest of us. ♪ Been such a long time What shall we drink to? ♪ Started up with a death I'd seen ♪ Strong women? - Sure. - Okay. ♪ I feel that I'm in a fantasy of things you say ♪ Do you have a boyfriend? Well, I have someone. But I don't like him. So get rid of him then. It's the woman that gets to choose, you see? Because women are the ones who accept. Look, the music has changed. It's a slow dance. What's that? It's when ladies can invite guys to dance. Mm-mm. Let's go. Yeah, yeah. Gentlemen, we invite you to a slow dance. Actually, cool guys don't dance. Yeah, except I don't see any cool guys here. Maxim? Be a gentleman. Petya, come on, I'll invite you to a dance. But I don't want to dance. Didn't you dance at summer camp when you were a kid? Do you keep a safe distance? I, don't remember there being dances there. Are you afraid of me? I won't send you to time-out. - I won't bite you. - I'm not afraid. And even if I was afraid, it doesn't have anything to do with dancing. Relax. I am relaxed, I just don't wanna dance. What happened that day here in the hold? I don't know. No one knows. Give in to your emotions. If I give in to my emotions, I won't be able to control myself. Did you play on the boat a lot? Mm-mm. We never played here. The captain here was a mean drunk, He'd drive us away. Where did you play then? At the factory. You know, hide-and-seek, tag. The older kids played with all kinds of smelly things. Smelly things? Uncle Nikolai would catch them. Uncle Nikolai? - Yeah. - Where did he work? At the factory, he was Uncle Tolya's boss. I won't bite you. What did the factory produce? Hey look, there's a bird over there. Some kind of chemicals. Someone's down there. You're hallucinating again. No, quiet. - Polina. - Quiet. Don't shout in my ear. It's a dog, guys. Well, come here. Good boy. Come here. Uncle Tolya. - Shut up! - What did I do? Hey, what're you doing? If you don't leave by tomorrow, you'll regret it. Polina. I thought you couldn't swim? What are you doing? I'm taking a water sample. Why? Remember that guy, who showed us the way, the old man. When we were coming here? Nikolai. He told me that the children would always be playing on the boat. - Uh-huh. - But Julia told me last night that they would only ever went to the factory to her uncle. So? He lied to me. Maybe he didn't lie, maybe he was just assuming. - Why do you think he lied? - He worked at the factory, He was her uncle's boss. When I was at their house, I found evidence that her uncle was utilizing waste products. When were you at her house? When we were looking for you. Who's that? It's time to go. Petya, come out. Alright, it's going. She's not here, calm down. Bring Julia back, stop! Stop. Give me back my daughter! Let's just go our own ways, this is private property... Give back my daughter! Quit hiding on that boat. Come back, stop running away! - Show me, show me! - It's okay. - Julia. - Julia! - Petya, show me, please. - I said go! Where's Julia? Julia! - Come back! - Julia. Leave her alone, you witch! There's no witch on this boat, we just finished talking to the police. There's no service, give us back the girl. We'll just leave, and that's all. We'll leave and... Come over here. - Julia. - Julia! We shouldn't have provoked them. It's kind of quiet. Did they leave? They're still there. What are they doing. Nothing, they're just standing there. Julia! Another, quick! On my way. Julia! Take this. Polina! Polina, Polina. Oh my God. - Everything is fine! - What are you doing? Let me go, it's fine. What were you doing! I almost put it all out. It doesn't matter you almost put it out. Look at your feet, what's that? Damn. Sit here and don't move! - Got it? - Alright. Good. That's the ambulance, right? Simonov? Simonov, come here. What do you want? I'm not asking you, I want the elder. What do I have to do with it? Julia told us everything. That's fine. We'll find a bandage after and we'll re-do it. Thank you. Wait, so you're just gonna leave like that? What else is there to do? I mean, we, we were almost burned alive. So what do you want me to do, go around and get everyone's fingerprints here? My brother got hit in the head. Petya, show him. Who hit you? I don't know, no one. See, he doesn't know. What don't you know! Tell him who did it! We didn't come here to sift through this shit, But for a completely different reason, Based on a girl's testimony. - Which girl? - That one. Julia, the local girl, she finally decided to run away from home and get to the city. She appealed to us. Her uncle was raping her. We sent her for a full examination, And everything was proven to be true. We looked him up in the database. And it turned out that he had already served also for rape. No, no, let's go, let's go, let's go. I'm getting so sick of all this. Ever since they closed all these enterprises in the 1990s, the factories fell apart, and everyone became unemployed alcoholics. Did you hear anything about the tragedy on this boat? When the children burned? Yeah, I did. Who was in charge of that, I mean, who led the investigation? I did. - You? - Mm-hmm. I wanted to be careful. But the prosecutor's office took up the case and they dragged it on, so all the traces evaporated. It was impossible to trace anything. But don't worry, I'll talk to Nikolai. He won't bother you anymore. You know, she's not that bad. Who? Polina. Maybe I should quit searching? Maybe she's the one? Or maybe she's actually the witch that'll end up eating your heart out. The car's not starting. What? I said the car's not starting. That's cause they ripped everything out of here. - What? - The battery, the distributor. There's no way we'll start it. Where are you going? To the boat. Why? What do you mean? We almost fixed it, right? We can take the boat back. Even if we do, the farthest we'll get is to the dam. How will we get around it? What other options are there? To walk? Have you forgotten about the locals already? You want us to fight through them in the village? What do you propose? I propose we finish the boat. To hell with the boat! Forget about the boat! There's no point in staying here any longer. What are you bitching out or something? Are you even my brother? Or are you some pushover now? I'll be waiting for you on the boat! We need to walk. Maxim, I won't be able to go with you. What? I won't make it with my injured foot. How about this. You go to the city by yourself and catch a car. I'll stay here with Petya and wait for you with him. You'll watch over my brother, soldier? Everything will be fine. Well, let's say goodbye. Why goodbye? We'll see each other soon. Here. I found it on the barge. My happiness bracelet. I was sure that I had lost it. Thank you. You know? Maybe it's better that you keep it. Why? If you look at it, you'll know where to find me right away. Where? In your memory. Well, I have many memories. Try to only remember the best ones. When we were happy. All-seeing Nikolai. Salute. Why weren't you at the boat today, huh? I feel a bit ill. Just don't drink from the backwater and you'll be okay. We've also started falling ill, we're having hallucinations that someone wants to set our boat on fire. That's terrible. Oh, uh, well maybe you should go out and get some medicine? That's what I'm going to the city for: medicine and samples. The city's in the other direction. All-seeing eye, huh. Why are you traveling so light? Well the car is out, it's not going anymore. Then take my bicycle. I don't know. - Go on. - Alright then. I just want to help. Indeed. I didn't throw stones at you. How do you know about the stones. The police told me. The police. Did they tell you about Julia too? And how she's already outside of your reach? Are you suggesting that I was an accomplice? Accomplice? No, covering up. What actually happened on that day when the children died. How can you speak about what you don't know, huh? Thanks for the bike! Alright, bye, thanks. I need to return today. Can you do it right now? Right now? How long will it take? Around four to five, hours. Alright. In four hours. What are you gonna wait around here? You should go home and eat something, wash up. Yeah, I probably should eat, huh? Are you still working? What happened to claustrophobia? Go to sleep. What are you doing here? Listen, leave me alone, all right? Let me finish. Petya. Petya, what's our car battery doing here? I just wanted to help Maxim out. Well, did you? - Yeah. - By breaking our car? That was our plan, we were supposed to leave here on this boat! Are you completely out of your mind? Just leave me alone and let me work here! You're a damn loony! Stay here! What are you doing? Open the door, open it! Let me out of here! Polina! Open the door! You can't do this to me! Please, Polina, stop! Polina! Open the door! You misbehaved, Petya. Don't. You didn't listen to me again. Mom, forgive me! I won't anymore! Mom, let me out, please! Mom! Forgive me, mom. I'm here. Calm down. It's cold here, mom. I want to be with you. Then swim to me. I'm waiting for you. Swim? The door is open. Yeah. Hey. Hey. So I found this substance in the water, it's called aldrin. It used to be used as an insecticide. It's extremely toxic. Overall there's not that much of that left in silt, but I wouldn't recommend taking mud baths, because it triggers hallucinations and affects the nervous system. What fresh air, Petya. It's so tough. As if the air disappeared. Do you feel it? I can't get enough of it. Tell me, where's home? There? Is that where we came from? That means the city is there, And Maxim is there too. I wonder what he's doing. My house isn't there. Where is it? Beyond the horizon. Really, behind it? Will you take me with you? No. Am I to remain here cold and all alone? What are you getting at? You think that since you've returned a witch, that everyone will be seduced by your charms? Petya, wake up. I can see right through you. Don not touch me. It's just a touch. I told you: do not touch me. Actually you should step back. Why are you like this. I'm trying to be nice. It's just a touch. That's a touch too. Shall I repeat it? Do you like it? Did your mom beat you or something? What? Don't talk about my mother, you wretch! Get away from me, YOU psycho! Are you out of your mind? It's all your fault! Witch! Maxim will find out, I'll tell him everything. What will he find out? This? How about this? This? Or this? Maybe you should tell him that you're a witch instead? And that you poison everyone's life, huh? Why don't you say anything, huh? Swim, you know how to swim! You know how to swim. Huh? Come on! Come on! How could I have overlooked? How could I even see? I did everything you told me to. I listened to nature, and to the wind, and to the leaves, But I couldn't hear my own daughter. Why can't you understand, that she slandered her own uncle's name. Do you really think that your own brother, That Anatoliy could do what they said? What about all the tests? The samples determined it, they made tests, and they said right away that it was him. They're lies. No, they aren't lies. They're lies. Tell me, how could they determine it so quickly? It's the strangers' fault, from the boat. They corrupted your innocent little girl. You'll tell me yourself! I don't know! Damn you! I don't know where your brother is. You know everything, you scum! And you don't go telling me stories about the other world. How about you, blessed one, what are you hiding there for? He killed your children! Don't touch her. The children died in that accident! At this factory! He thought that no one would find out! What are you lying for? Don't listen to him, Natalia. No, you listen to me. The children died from a poison gas leakage. And to conceal it, he came up with this fairy tale about the boat. He faked a fire, but in fact, the backwater, is still poisoned with that shit from the factory. And this psycho convinced you with the stories about the water being cursed. Well, am I wrong? It's nonsense. It's all lies, you see. - All lies. - Did you burn the children? You burned the children, right? Why are you so fixated on the children, huh? Children, children! Why aren't you thinking about your friends? Where did they run off? You keep searching, looking! Maybe we should get the funeral service ready? What did you say? What happened to them? With who? The children, or your missing friends? I'm going to kill you, you scum. Then you won't find out anything. So who do you wanna know about? Hey! Hey, hey! Listen man! Did you see a boat here? Passing by? What kind of boat? It's called Outpour. It's pretty big, and it's burned. No, I didn't see it. But I only just woke up, so maybe it already passed by here. Wait, what happened anyway? Maybe I can help you? Whose barge is that? Mine. Are you Valera by any chance? Yeah, Valera. So you've heard of me? Were you in the city? And celebrating a wedding on it? You picked apples there, right? Well actually I organized the wedding. And I went to the city. But I didn't go picking any apples. There was a girl that picked them. Though I don't remember her name. Polina. Exactly. Polina. She was kind of strange. She kept talking about her boyfriend. She stood on the side, and didn't react to anyone. Listen friend, you don't look all that good. Did you get in a fight with the locals or something? I'm sick of them. They stole my dynamite. It's a real catastrophe. I wanted to do business here, And widen the waterway. The authorities told me that I'd have to do that with my own money, alright, I thought, no problem. I'm not even sore about the dynamite, I just hope they don't blow anything up. You understand. I hope they don't blow anything up. Maxim. Maxim. I'm glad you got here in time! Look, I think we're gonna have enough power to blow through the dam. So we can finally pass through on the boat. You're coming with me, aren't you? Or did you come down here so you can say goodbye? Petya, Polina's dead. Just get in the car, we're going home. Come on. It's not her. The actual Polina, she disappeared when she left for the wedding, remember? She's waiting, she's waiting for the time when you learn to cherish her. Polina, the real one, died. She drowned. That wasn't the real Polina, that was a witch, A witch who need you. To enter the other world. The real Polina wouldn't have tried to come on to me and try to come between us. That was a witch. Don't you remember how merry she was? Yeah. Well? We killed her. We turned her into dust. What do you mean we? We're guilty. If you die that kind of a death, it just means that God doesn't want you to continue living. - Petya. - Accept it. Petya, I pulled you out of your treatments early, it's time for you to go back. Petya. I won't go back... Listen to me, listen to me. Leave the dynamite. We're going home. You're the most important thing that I have left, that remains in my life. No, Maxim. Mom is waiting for me. Sorry, brother. Your bracelet is just like mine. Here, look. But if you want all your wishes to come true, you have to put it on your arm and wear it, just like this. There. Good? - I love you. - I know. Forgive me. For what? Forgive me for not understanding, in time. Hush, hush, hush. Because I love you. You think too much, when you should be feeling instead. With your whole heart. You understand? There's no borders here. You can be whoever you want here. You can rest here, you can have fun, you can play, you can be free here. I'll come back soon. But when? When the sun comes down and you can't see the horizon anymore, I'll come down to you. But shh, don't tell anybody.
