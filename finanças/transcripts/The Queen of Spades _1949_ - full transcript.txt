Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes For heaven's sake, don't play the Queen of spades. She's unlucky. What's the matter? They're all unlucky for me tonight. But you can back any spade. My win. Your win. My win. Your win. My win. Your win. Mine. The unlucky card! What a fool to risk the Queen. You win. Good night, Andrei Andreiovich. Thank you. Don't go, Petrov. Don't leave us. I think I'll be getting to bed. Have a glass of wine first. All my year's pay is gone. Oh, never mind. You'll have another year's pay in another year's time. Petrov, I challenge you. I challenge you to one more hand. Fyodor, no, no. It's getting too late. Gentlemen, let's drink. There's food on the side tables. Help yourselves. I want to go on playing. I don't care if I lose every kopek. Who'll play for double stakes? Sit down. We'll have another hand later. No need to scare. Leave me alone. Hey, why doesn't he play? Yes, you , sir. Standing here every night like a French spy watching us. Haven't the engineers quarters of their own? Don't listen to him, German. It's only the wine talking. I want an answer to my question. Stop it, Fyodor ! Captain Suvorin is here as my guest. He has every right not to play, if he doesn't care to. Well, I beg your pardon. But tell me this, sir. If you're so interested as to come here night after night, Why do you never touch a card? Tell us ! Yes, I've often wondered how he can resist playing. Are you trying to work out a system ? Pray, it interests me very much. But I cannot afford to risk unnecessarily the hopes of winning the Super Cross. Marshenka! Bravo ! Bravo ! I'll show them all one day. Why does German Suvarin come here every night ? Yes, why ? He never plays cards. He's the sort of man who'd be afraid to stake anything unless he was sure of winning. Can anyone be sure of winning ? No. What was that you were telling us about your old grandmother, Fyodor ? The Countess Ravenskaya? She's a wonderful old woman. Is it true she's over a hundred ? Are you speaking of old Countess Ravenskaya ? Why? Do you know her? No, but I soon shall. My aunt is going to persuade her to ask General Volkoninov to make me his aide-de-camp. Oh, really? My aunt swears she's the most grotesque creature you ever saw. With a high powdered wig like they used to wear fifty years ago. And a quilling to match. I believe she's a witch. Nonsense! That's absolute rubbish. But it is true that the old countess had the secret of how to win at cards. It's certainly true though that on one occasion she won an immense amount of money. By selling her soul to the devil. For a secret like that I'd sell mine. The secret of how to win at cards? Get to bed! Drunkard! Yes, sir. Shut the stove. Good night, sir. Get out ! Good night, your honor. I'm sorry about Fyodor Pavelvich's behavior tonight. I... I came to apologize. Thank you. You seemed less put out by it than I was. Perhaps you prefer me not to come to your card parties. Oh, no, of course not. Why should I? I mean... I may embarrass you. You see, I'm only a poor captain in engineers. You are rich aristocrats. Guard officers. I think you're exaggerating things a bit. You see, poor old Fyodor was.. Well, he was well in his cups and... German, why not come back? Don't you like listening to the gypsies? Gypsies. Why not call them what they are? Don't be quite so hard on them, German. What chance have they born in such circumstances? You never blame anyone, do you? No, not if I can help it. I believe all human beings are fundamentally good. I'm convinced of it. Oh, yes? Yes, and I believe also... that evil is a force, a mighty force that is abroad in the world to take possession of men's souls, if they will allow it to. I'm not interested in problems as good and evil. To me they're beside the point. Why don't you come back, German? No. But, aren't you fascinated by that gypsy dancer, Marchenka? Yes, I've seen her. Don't you agree? I've told you. I'm not interested in that sort of woman. Then perhaps you'll come as my guest. You're very kind. But no, thank you. Look here, German, I know I have to be careful about money. But, after all, we have been paid today. And you needn't spend much. I cannot afford to spend anything. You're always too proud to accept anything from anyone, aren't you? Well, deuce, you're quite right. It's senseless to go back there. I could do with some sleep. Good night. Good night. So they have paid you at last, have they? It must be almost a year. Ten months. Don't you want to keep one of these things? I've taken enough for my needs. I've never saved a kopek in my life. I've spent it all on food, and drink, and women. So here I am. Fifty-four and a wretched notary. Vodka? But I'm content. If I was to be put under the ground tomorrow.... I wouldn't grumble. I've got everything I want out of life. God's been very good to me. Everything a man could want. Well, I haven't. You've done very well. You're a captain. Yes, in engineers at my age. Over here no one can win promotion unless he's rich. Or unless he has some important and powerful relatives to use their influence on his behalf. Exceptional men have stifled and never had the chance to succeed. Look at France. Napoleon Bonaparte, he was a general at 26. My advice to you is to be content. As I am. Take life as you find it. I'd rather take it by the throat and force it to give me what I want. You've forgotten your receipt. I deducted five rubles for my fee, if that's agreeable. As you wish. This is a very rare book. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. It tells of strange things that some say are better left alone. How much is it? Three rubles. That's a lot, I know. But there are plenty of people who believe in things neither looked for nor heard of. What mean these premonitions, these hauntings, these apparitions? These tales of horror in a far site in time and space. Believe me, there are things to be seen the eye has not seen. And things to be heard the ear has not heard. Who knows what you may learn from it? Why, you might end up by gaining a fortune. Or losing your precious soul. Containing the true stories of people who sold their souls in return for wealth, power or influence. Chapter 4. The Secret of the Cards. Countess R*** Countess Ranevskaya. In the year 1746, sixty years ago... The Count of Saint Germain arrived in St. Petersburg. He chose for his residence a deserted palace on the outskirts of the city and soon there were strange rumors about the weird dwelling and its mysterious occupant. It was certainly true that in the vaults of the palace he had a curious collection of wax figures... which... so it was whispered... contained the souls of those who had fallen under his evil influence. He would derive intense pleasure from modeling the wax figures of his intended victims. Each one of whom was chosen with deliberate appreciation. Thus the Countess Ranevskaya, acknowledged the most beautiful woman in Russia, came to excite his attention. He had learned that in spite of a jealous husband all the men of fashion vied with each other for her favors. Go now. Later. Countess. Who is it? What do you want? I think you will need my master's help. I need no one's help. You will, Countess. You will need it tomorrow. Tomorrow? Can he see into the future then? He can see a long way. Who is he? He is known as Saint Germain. You will find him at the Dolgoruki Palace. When the last of the guests had left, the countess went down the secret stairway. to admit the young stranger she had promised to meet. She alone had the key to the hidden door. But in the early hours of the morning... What are you doing? Where's the money? I beg you. I beseech you. The money's not mine. My husband will find out. Do you wish to ruin me? I have no wish but to save myself from ruin, Countess. Give me the key. Why, you pray? A common thief parading as a gentleman? You should take more care, madame... with your amorous escapades. My husband. Anna, is anything the matter? Give me the key. Anna! Why don't you answer me? She was haunted by the fear of scandal. The money belonged to her husband's regiment, Somehow she must replace it without delay. In her despair she remembered the strange message from Saint Germain. She had no alternative but to answer the mysterious summons. Nothing else could save her. She would sell her soul... anything... to save herself. She went to the Dolgoruki Palace. Go! Saint Germain gave her the secret of the three winning cards. In return she made the solemn vow that no one else would ever know the secret. Holy Virgin, have mercy. Have mercy on me. One hour later she was on the way to the gaming rooms. Accept this pledge. She played the three cards in succession. She won a fortune. But the horrors of her visit to Saint Germain... left a mark on her soul for the rest of her life. Please, sir, spare a kopek. Please, please, sir. Spare a kopek. Please, sir, spare a kopek. Please, please. Who owns that house? Countess Ranevskaya. Not often she gives a ball. Countess Ranevskaya. She's still alive? Oh! Will you do me a favor? I like the army. Oh, that's very good for me. What is it? Well, you see... A secret of the heart. Yes, yes... Do you know the young woman in the house? Lizaveta Ivanovna? Of course I know her. This is her dress I've got here now. Wants to make it look new, poor thing. As if we could work miracles. Is there a chance of meeting Lizaveta Ivanovna? Oh, I don't know. The old countess never lets her out of her sight. It's come here, do this, do that, all day long. This coat of mine needs seaming. Look, the seam here... could you? Lizaveta! Ana Fyodorovna. Why do you come creeping into the room? You're like the rest of them in this house. The sudden shock might bring on a heart attack, you'd hope. If you think me capable of such wicked thoughts, Anna Fyodorovna, would it not be better for me to go? Go? And where could you go, pray? Is that the gratitude you give your benefactress... for taking you, a poor orphan, into her care? You cannot want me here if you think I wish for your death. Why are you dressed up like that, pray? Whom are you intending to captivate? The prince my grandson was announced just now. You said we were going for a drive, Anna Fyodorovna. Drive in this weather? It's calm out. There's not a breath of... What's that you said? It's calm out, and quite mild. Nothing of the sort. It's windy and bitterly cold. You don't wish to go, then? I should think not. Sit down and read to me. But Anna Fyodorovna... But, but! Always objections. I was about to remind you that Prince Fyodor is here. Hm, well... Now get the book. What were we reading? Don Juan, Countess. I think it's on the shelf here. Love stories, love stories. Always reading love stories. What are you doing there? Not there, not there! Close it! Close it, I said! Close it! How dare you! You're a wicked, wicked girl. I'm sorry, Anna Fyodorovna. I had no idea there was anything there. I'm... Where is the key to that door? Give it to me. I have no key, Anna Fyodorovna, I tell you... Have you used that staircase to admit others to your room? How could you say such... Lies and duplicity! No one in this house speaks the truth, not anyone. I will see, Lizaveta Ivanovna. We shall find the key missing. Oh... There it is... after all. Prince Krykulin and Prince Narumov. Quick! Give me my stick! Give me my stick. How do you do, grandmother? Allow me to present my friend, Andrei Andeievich, Prince Narumov. Be seated. And you too, Fyodor. No, no, no! Oh, my poor little one. Narumov... Narumov... yes. I remember your dear mother quite well. Princess Darya Petrovna. That was my grandmother, Countess. Your grandmother? Oh, yes, yes.. Of course. I was forgetting. What have you been reading lately, Fyodor? You must bring me some of the latest French novels. Not one where the heroine drowns herself for love. Varvaruschka! What is it, my little one. Oh, there. Tell old Varvaruschka all about it. I know I oughtn't to mind anymore. But she's so cruel Varvaruschka, darling. Why should she be so cruel? She's old. She's near the grave and she hasn't found peace, poor soul. I was so happy once. A home, my mother, my father. So happy. You will be again, poor lonely heart. Will I? Sometimes I feel I'll never leave this house. I know. Little caged bird. But you'll see. Be patient. And someday soon, perhaps, you will meet someone who will love you very much. He will help you to be free and happy again. Where is that dog taking us? This is not the way to the bird market. It's the way we always come, Anna Fyodorovna. Well, it looks quite different to me. Lizaveta Ivanovna? Orderly Narumov. I came with Fyodor Pavlovitch the other day I hoped to be presented to you but you ran away. Yes, of course, Prince Narumov. May I accompany you? Yes, if you wish. I have to buy some more little birds for the countess's aviary. Your honor. Buy a nice fat duck, sir. Buy a duck, sir. A duck, buy a nice fat duck. Yes, your honor? I hate to see caged birds. How can one enjoy their singing? If I ever come into a fortune I shall buy all little birds. Every one of them. And I shall set them free and watch them fly away into the clouds. Go tell Lizaveta Ivanovna to come at once! I cannot be kept here waiting all day. Yes, Excellency. Will you be at the Opera next week? Yes, I will. Do you think I might see you there? Please do, if you wish. Perhaps we might continue our conversation. Do you think, Lizaveta Ivanovna, I might come to your box in the theater? Oh, I do. Yes, indeed I do. Please excuse me now, I daren't keep the countess waiting. Come on, Andrei, drink up. What's the matter with you? Oh, nothing, nothing at all. You've got all the symptoms of a man in love. Have I? Do I know her? In a sense, yes. Do you remember your grandmother's young companion? Lizaveta Ivanovna? Why she's a pathetic little creature. Is she? I'm sorry. I didn't know you knew her. Where on earth did you manage to see her? I met her accidentally one day at the bird market. She was buying some canaries for your grandmother. My dear old fellow, you're not really serious about this, are you? Yes. I've never been more serious in my life. Come on, have a drink. Come in. Oh, so you're in. I wonder why you stopped coming to our card parties. Why don't you come tonight? No, thank you. I'm not interested in cards at the moment. Forget hard work for once. Oh, I'm not working, I'm... writing a love letter. You writing a love letter? But you've never written one in your life, have you? Why, have you? Well, not properly, no, but I know now what it's like to be in love. Then tell me how you would compose a letter of this sort. I mean, what burning phrases would you use? I should say, "I love you to distraction." "Your dark eyes have driven away my rest and peace. Oh, if you could but love me." I have got a letter for you. This can't be for me. But it is. It couldn't be. I don't know this person. German Suvorin. I've never heard of him in my life. Well, it's addressed to you. No. There must be some mistake. Of course it's for you. You read it through properly and see. Why have you torn it up if it isn't for you? You must go now. What shall I say? Haven't you got a message for him? Tell him please not to write to me again. I love you to distraction. Your dark eyes have driven away my rest and peace. Your dark eyes have driven away my rest and peace. Lisaveta, if you could but love me. To Lisaveta Ivanovna. I revere you... I esteem and admire you. You are dearer to me than language has the power of telling. You are dearer to me than language has the power of telling. Don't touch my arm like that or I shall be black and blue. That will do. That's enough. Don't fidget me, my dear. I'm quite capable of walking by myself. I will be waiting for you at the entrance of the Opera House. Who's there? Who's there? It's I, grandmama. Pray don't disturb yourself. I cannot withstand people creeping about me like this. How are you, my dear boy? Liza, make room for the prince. No, please. I can see well enough from here. If you don't meet me tonight, I shall kill myself. And you will be responsible for my death. Fyodor Pavlovitch, you're making fun of me. No, I assure you. You've made a conquest. Who is it, then? A very charming friend of mine. Is he in the army? Yes. In the engineers? No, he's in the horse guards with me. Don't you recall the occasion I brought him to the countess' house and we heard you crying on the staircase? Yes, of course... Oh, so that's who it is. But why the engineers, Lizaveta Ivanovna? Oh, no particular reason. Come now. You're blushing. I've just discovered your little secret. Nothing of the sort. There's no secret at all. What are you whispering about? The music, Grandmama. Well, pull up your chair. You can't see from there. I do not like that dress, Lizaveta. A girl of your age should not expose herself like that. especially when we are together. Now remember, you must make yourself as agreeable as possible for the countess. Flatter her a little. What, Aunt Katya? Flatter! Flatter her a little. Oh, yes, I see. What sort of thing should I say? Why, any odd words, my dear boy. What would you say to some charming young girl? I don't know, Aunt Katya. Pay her some compliments. Be gay and amusing. Countess Ranevskaya. Yes. I have my nephew with me. He's the grandson of your old friend, Count Dobrinski. He's been pleading me to present him to you. Where is he? Nicky... Nicky! So you're Dobrinski's grandson. I should never have known it. He was the handsomest man in the Imperial Guard. And I dare say he still is. I didn't really know my grandpapa, Countess. I can just remember a great fat man with a purple face who was always hitting the servants with his stick and making us all laugh. It must be fifteen years since he died but I can still remember his coffin being carried out. What is the boy saying? Yes, it was most unfortunate. Most unfortunate. Why unfortunate, Aunt Katya. After all, he was nearly eighty. What else could you expect at that age? We shall be seeing you at the ball tomorrow. Young lout. Oh, Andrei. Who's that? Oh, make room for Prince Narumov. What's the matter with you tonight? It's quite all right. I can see quite well from here. How hot it is in here. Quite stifling. Are you feeling unwell? It's my head. I feel faint. I think I'll go and sit in the foyer for a little while. Yes, of course. May I escort you? No, I assure you it's only the heat. I shall have recovered in a few moments. I don't think that... No, I insist, I insist! That probably accounts for the young baron's insistence. He's reputed to be uncommonly fond of... Lizaveta! Odd to meet you here. Where else can we meet? Someone is bound to see us. I must speak to you. They'll be looking for me. I have only a moment. Please. Listen, Lizaveta. That was no idle threat in my letter. If I cannot go on seeing you there is only one solution for me: death. Death? Yes, I'd rather die here at your feet than live without you. Death is nothing to me. You frighten me when you talk like that. Oh, then I'll be silent. Only I beg, don't send away the man to whom the sight of you is all the consolation he has left. I don't make any demands upon you, but I must, unless I carry out my threats, have leave to see you. When and where? I can never leave the house alone. Promotion? And how can you get a promotion? My coat. How can you get promotion... unless you win the favor of some general? You stupid boy! I was only trying to be gay and amusing, Aunt Katya. Gay and amusing? Don't talk to me about gay and amusing. You must get away from this life. You must do as I say. When do you go out with the countess again? Tomorrow night to the ball. Tomorrow? And what time do you return? At three. I'll slip into the house at midnight and wait. Will there be any servants about? No. They all retire to sleep awaiting our return. Help me, Lizaveta. Where can I wait? Where can I conceal myself? No. Please forget what I said. I must be out of my senses. Lizaveta! Please let me go now. I love you. Do you believe me? Yes. Then do as I say. I intend to find my way inside the house. I think I'll go and see how she is, Fyodor. I feel uneasy. You'll only anger her. Don't worry, she'll be back before long. I cross the hall and come right to the servant's staircase. Yes. The sewing room is at the top. Wait for me there. And the countess' bed chamber, you say, is on the first floor beyond the drawing room. Yes. But be quite sure you don't go that way. I must go back now. I'm frightened. Please let us wait. There's nothing to be frightened of. And please put a candle on your bedroom window That way I can know if something has gone wrong. Where's Captain Suvorin? His Honor will be back in a minute, Your Excellency. Andrei! What a surprise. I want an explanation from you. What are your relations with Lizaveta Ivanovna Leodovski? Come now, no play acting, please. I saw you together at the Opera House last night. And since when do I have to explain my actions to you? What are your intentions towards Lizaveta Ivanovna? I insist on knowing! Now what's the reason for this sudden outburst? Just because you see me with a girl in the foyer of the Opera House? You're planning a cold-blooded seduction. Why else should you meet Lizaveta Ivanovna so secretly? Don't interfere with my plans, you... insolent young puppy. I'm warning you, Suvorin. I shall hold you responsible for any ill that may befall her. What is Lizaveta doing? Go and find out! Oh, not both of you! Oh, go away, go away, go away! Who is mother's girl? Yes. Now take care of Ang?le... and see that she doesn't get near Vodka. Where is Vodka? Where is the dog? Fedya! I could be set on my heels on my own door for all my servants care. Skiovka doesn't like the dog, Your Excellency, It's always crowding her. Skiovska is a servant! Lizaveta Ivanovna! How much longer am I to be kept waiting? Have you taken leave of your senses, Liza? Don't stand there! What have you been doing? I'm sorry, Ana Fyodorovna. I forgot my reticule. I wonder. Do you think I might be excused from coming to the ball? Oh, what is it now? Another of those swooning fits you had at the opera last night? And what are those flowers in your hair? Modesty of demeanor is all that is required of you. Come now. They've been waiting for me at the ball this half hour. Hurry up! Don't leave us here all night. Excuse me, Countess! I don't want to disturb her. General Volkoninov, Countess. What's that? General Volkoninov. I know perfectly well who it is, thank you. There's no occasion to shout at me. Well, General, I trust you're enjoying good health. Splendid! Splendid! And you? Excellent! Excellent! Capital. Prince Narumov, Countess. Hm? Oh, Narumov. And how is my old friend your mother? She's in excellent health, Countess. She sends you her regards. Capital, capital. I've come to beg the honor of a dance with Lizaveta Ivanovna, Countess. That's unfortunate. She's not in very good health. She's not feeling very well tonight. Oh, yes I am, Countess. Will you excuse me? No, no. That's impossible. I cannot be left sitting by myself. I expect Princess Ivashin to join me later. Perhaps then Lizaveta will be well enough to dance. Lizaveta Ivanovna, are you doing everything in your power deliberately to try and provoke me? All this evening you've been complaining of feeling ill and faint and begging me to let you go home. Next instant you're ready to dance about with the first person who chooses to ask you. Why did you call me here tonight? I knew it. You knew what? You wouldn't get to dance. Why? You don't know my grandmother. She hates being left alone. She always gets her own way. Yes, and she's the most exasperating... Andrei, she's an old woman and she's afraid of death. Mind you, she's got far too much courage ever to show it to anybody. Lizaveta, is it cold in here? Cold? No, I don't think so. Put my shawl around me. I feel cold. Vodka! Come back! Ladies and gentlemen. Please take your partners for the mazurka. Lizaveta Ivanovna, I must speak to you after the dance. Yes, of course. What about? It's most important. It's about German Suvorin. But Lizaveta! I don't wish to discuss it. I know nothing of your relations with Suvorin. Please, I beg you. Do not trust him. He's dangerous. You presume too much on a slight acquaintance with me, Prince. Please, Liza... Liza, if anything should happen to you, I'd never forgive myself for failing to warn you. I'm truly amazed that one officer should try to defame another as you have done to me. Good night, Prince. Vassili, are you there? The countess is back. Good night, Countess. German. There now. Now you'll sleep tonight. You must go to bed. I cannot sleep. I cannot sleep. Good night, Ana Fyodorovna. God be with you. May the power of the Holy Cross protect you. Holy Virgin, have mercy on me. Have mercy on me. Holy Virgin, have mercy on me. Have mercy on me. Holy Virgin Don't cry out! Don't be alarmed! Please, don't be alarmed I don't mean to do you any harm. I've come to ask a favor of you. That's all. A favor. It will cost you nothing. But to me it will bring happiness... for the rest of my life. I want the secret of the cards. That's all. Come. What is it? The three cards. The names of the three cards. Please. It's no use pretending you don't know anything about it. I know you've been given the secret. And I know who gave it to you. Please. Just think those three words aloud. And I trouble you no more. I go. What good is the secret to you? For whom are you keeping it? For your grandson? He's rich enough. What would another fortune mean to him? A waster and a spendthrift. But I'm not a man of that sort. I know the value of money. I could do great things, I tell you. Great things. If only I had money. For the love of God. If you have any human feeling in your breast you can't refuse me. I beg... I beseech you. I know why you won't speak. The secret is connected with some kind of a sin. That's it, isn't it? But I make a bargain with you. Tell me your secret and I'll take your sin upon my soul. Do you hear me? I mean it! A bargain. I'll take your sin upon my own soul. Speak! Speak to me, you old thing! Or by God I will make you. I ask you for the last time. Aren't you going to tell me the secret of the cards? Or are you... No! German. Where have you been? What is it? Are you ill? German, what has happened? I... I've been to the countess's room. Did she see you? Hm-hmm. She's dead. What did you say? She's dead. I must go to her. Do you want us to be discovered? What are we going to do? German... what are we going to do? If only you hadn't taken the passage to the left. I did it deliberately. Deliberately? Share a secret. I wanted that secret. I don't understand. But she died... and took the secret with her. You wanted her secret? That was the reason for your rituals... outside my window. She cheated me. Your letters... your wonderful letters... A fortune was within my grasp. All lies then. All lies. And she refused to speak. Oh, what have I done? Holy Mother. What have I done? She deserved... to die. Murderer! No... No, I never meant to kill her. It isn't... It's not loaded. Don't, German. Get out of here. If you have any sense of decency... spare me your sight. But it's nearly dawn. The servants will be up. How will I leave the house? I don't know. Use the secret staircase from the countess's room It leads down to the street. How do I find it? It's part of the bookcase. Press the carving on the sixth shelf. The key is on the dressing table. Murderer? The sixth bookshelf. The dead shall give up all their secrets. I am commanded to grant your request. Three, seven, ace. I forgive you my death on condition that you marry my ward, Lizaveta Ivanovna. Three. Seven. Ace. Three. Seven. Ace. The cards. The secret. Your health. Now would you just mind signing that, please? Thank you. Forty-seven thousand rubles. There you are. And that's quite a fortune. Yes, and what about a little something for myself? Oh, and I deserved it. It wasn't easy realizing all the money on such short a notice. What are you going to do with it? Something foolish, I'll be bound. I know you quiet ones when you decide to break out. Vodka and gypsy girls. Here's luck. I wish I were in your shoes. Careful, now. Goodbye, my little one. My darling. Think about Varvaruschka sometimes. Of course I shall think of you, my darling. We shall never see each other in this life again. May God bless and keep you and the power of the Holy Cross protect you. Goodbye. Bye. Lizaveta. Lizaveta Ivanovna. I have something to tell you. Please let me pass. But it's of the utmost importance to you. Why have you come back to torment me like this? Not to torment you, Lizaveta. I've come back to ask your forgiveness. Forgive me, Lizaveta. For what you've done to me I forgive you. But as for the countess's death I can never forgive either you or myself. Lizaveta... I don't want to listen to you. I'm going away. No, you can't. You can't. Lizaveta, listen to me. Please, please listen to me. I admit when I first saw you at the window I made my plans... you were nothing to me, a stranger. My love was faint. But it all has changed now. Don't you see, Lizaveta? I love you. Yes. I love you. And I'm asking you to be my wife. You're nothing but a murderer to me. Think of me what you like. Only marry me. Oh, I see. You don't want to be the wife of German Suvorin because I'm only a humble captain in engineers. Don't you make a mistake. It will all be different tomorrow.
