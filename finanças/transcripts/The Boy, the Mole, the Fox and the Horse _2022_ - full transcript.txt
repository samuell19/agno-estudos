Hello. Hello. What are you doing here? I'm lost. Oh, dear. Well, that's no good. So, how did you get here? Well, hello. Hello, who? Hello, cake. What cake? That cake. It looks delicious. Spectacular. I mean it's magnificent. I can't see a cake. It's… It's a tree. It is a lovely tree. And it did look a bit like a cake. So... Yes. Well, no cake. And you're lost. Yes. An old mole once told me, "When you're lost, follow the river, and it will take you home." But I can't see a river. Perhaps you could see one from that branch. And if you happen to see a cake while you're up the... I'm so sorry. Oh, no. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Completely my fault. I'm really sorry. Well, no. Thank you. I was feeling a bit warm actually. What can you see? Nothing, really. What do you want to be when you grow up? Kind. Nothing beats kindness. It sits quietly beyond all things. So much beauty we need to look after. Yes. So much. Are you all right? Sorry. Yes, totally fine. No, just thought we should start looking for that river. Lemon drizzle. This is quite a hill. Is this better? Well, I don't want to be too much trouble. - It's okay. - Well, thank you. What's that over there? It's the wild. Don't fear it. Look. I can see a river. Wait. What? I said don't fear it, not charge straight at it. I mean, really. Good grief. Do you have a favorite saying? Yes. What is it? If at first you don't succeed, have some cake. I see. Does it work? Every time. Did the old mole say which way we should follow? I didn't ask her that. Isn't it odd, we can only see our outsides, but nearly everything happens on the inside? Is there something there? It's getting dark. Shall we… Good idea. We can set off properly tomorrow. What was that? Imagine how we'd be if we were less afraid. Most of the old moles I know wish they'd listened less to their fears and more to their dreams. What do you dream about? Home. What's that like? I don't know. I'm… not sure. But I know I need one. Oh, golly. He looks hungry. He does. It's okay. The fox is gone. What was that? I'm not sure. Do you think someone's hurt? Maybe. Should we go and check? Good idea. I'll stay in here to keep you warm. Okay. Thank you. It's the fox. He's trapped. Oh, dear. Please, be careful. I am not afraid. If I wasn't caught in this snare, I'd kill you. If you stay in that snare, you'll die. You did so well. One of our greatest freedoms is how we react to things. Lovely morning. Shall we get go... Whoops. You're rolling. You look like a snowball. No, a mole ball. A snow mole. Stop rolling. Goodness me. Oh, gosh, no. The river. Look out! Take my hand. Oh, no. The fox. No! No. Thank you. Thank you. The fox is back. Do you think he's coming with us? I do hope so. Maybe he's lost too. Well, I think everyone feels a bit lost sometimes. I know I do. I know what a home looks like. - Do you? - Yes. It has walls, a roof, a bell above the door and cakes in every window. I think that's a cake shop. Is that not a type of home? You can't live in a cake shop. Well, why ever not? I think home is somewhere warm and kind, with lights. Hello. Hello. Hello. Have you been here a while? It feels that way. Are you lost? No. We are, but we have a plan. The snow on the trees, it really does look just like icing. You're obsessed. Doing nothing with friends is never doing nothing, is it? No. Look at that. I am so small. Yes, but you make a huge difference. So, what are we doing? Well, we're on a quest for cake. Are you now? No, not really. We're following the river to find a home. How far is it? We don't know. Well, let's get going then. How fast can you run? Well, I wouldn't say I was a natural athlete, but I did once win a digging competition. I don't mean you. I see. Well, I... Golly. You fell. But I've got you. Sorry. It was an accident. It's my fault. I let go. Oh, gosh. Sorry. No. Tears fall for a reason. And they're your strength, not weakness. I think you believe in me more than I do. You'll catch up. Life is difficult… but you are loved. Look. Lights. That looks like a home. Yes, it does, doesn't it? The fox never really speaks. No. And it's lovely he's with us. To be honest… I often feel I've got nothing interesting to say. Being honest is always interesting. What's the bravest thing you've ever said? "Help." Asking for help isn't giving up. It's refusing to give up. Sometimes, I want to say, "I love you, all." But I find it difficult. Do you? Yes, so I say something like, "I'm glad we're all here." Okay. I'm glad we're all here. We're so glad we're here too. What should we do? That didn't sound good. Good grief, I don't like this. When the big things feel out of control, focus on what you love right under your nose. I like that. This storm will pass. Oh, no. Where are the lights? I can't see them anymore. It feels like we have such a long way to go. I know. But look how far we've come. I just don't think I can do this. I'm never going to find a home. You know, sometimes your mind plays tricks on you. It can tell you you're no good, that it's all hopeless. But I've discovered this: You are loved and important, and you bring to this world things that no one else can. So hold on. Are you all right? There's something I haven't told you. What? I can fly. You can fly? Yes. But I stopped because it made the other horses jealous. Well, we love you whether you can fly or not. Come and join us. I think I'll stay here. Thank you. Please. Look. There it is. You found it. It looks like a home, doesn't it? Well, here we are then. Yes. Thank you. Goodbye. Always remember… you're enough. Just as you are. I'm glad we're all here. I'm so glad you're here too. Goodbye. I'm really going to miss you. No. Home isn't always a place, is it? Well, this is warm. And very kind. And look at the stars. So, you know all about me? Yes. And you still love me? We love you all the more. That's why we're here, isn't it? For cake? To love. And be loved.
