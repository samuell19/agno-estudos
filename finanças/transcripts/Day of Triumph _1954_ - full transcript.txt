beyond the Jordan the nations vowed in helpless submission to the legions of the Empire yet in every vassal state there were men who clung to the dream of freedom struck back at their oppressors planned unceasingly to cast off the yoke of slavery in the Land of Israel those who dared were known as the zealots this was Jerusalem in the 18th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar you that shop is

King gay even Herod Antipas who we call Tetrarch revels in sin and debauchery Francie's false marriage with the woman he took from his brother he may have leadership but a certain lacks judgment boy a

spark that King Guzman open their hearts to repentance grant them Redemption from thy wrath grant them the gift of thy forgiveness now who aren't all-powerful all-knowing Almighty come come step forward in the name of the lord my god come on the rock where no joke Harrison get the wrath of the Lord Jehovah are you hurt Oh shall I have a very hard head I'm a stout heart deeply grateful to you and your friend I don't even know your name he is a doctor spice merchant of Jerusalem diam and revoir Jonah's fisherman from Galilee and you my name is Judas Judas Iscariot with no hope of using the Baptist to our advantage I sent Judas westward on mana matters concerning the Brotherhood and I traveled south to Jerusalem you Andrew you returned to Galilee yes back to my brother and our fishing boat and this became weeks and weeks a month then one day while we were hanging our nets by the Sea of Galilee you the day Andrew hello you know my name I saw you brother Jordan you're the Nazarene Simon James John come here well this is Jesus Bart Joseph the man from Nazareth oh my brother simon barjona s' sermon and our friends James and John bars evident you know the carpenter no more no longer will I labor with wood now my workers with mankind this new task you've undertaken this work with men I bring them hope new hope but the kingdom of God is close at hand his forgiveness ready for all who repent and truly believe just the Baptist predicted if there's anything I can do that we can do to help you nothing where teachers or preachers were just fishermen follow me I will make you fishers of men from that day on we followed him not asking why we did knowing only that we wanted to more than any other thing we aren't him preach in our own synagogue in Capernaum reading the Torah as expertly as a scribe interpreting the laws so clearly that all men marveled at his knowledge authority we followed him along the roads of Galilee to the villages towns and cities learn that the gift Healing lay in his hands the gentleness and compassion for all men build his heart wherever he spoke the people listened many followed him from village to village among them the man Judas never entering into the discussions but always studying a master intently as a masters Fame increased so did his followers in certain Pharisees who considered themselves authorities on a religious law presented him bitterly why did you let them break the traditions of the elders would you destroy all it is holy all it is sacred well that Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites as it is written this people honors me with their lips but their heart is far from me in vain do they worship Me teaching as doctrines the precepts of men gimme hear me all of you would understand there is nothing outside a man which by going into him can defile but the things that come out of a man are what defile him you Oh Oh you a message to say dr. Adnan virtutis spices with humble respect it is possible our search for a leader of the downtrodden is ended business yes master I promise to take you along on my next visit to the leaders of the northern bands next month you said it'll be sooner than that much sooner it's urgent that I inspect a certain Galilean who may be useful so you can quit posing as a gardener and start acting as a spice merchant servant good anything is better than garden Simon in the name of the Brotherhood welcome is one friend to another What's Wrong Simon my dagger carrying days are over your friends waiting on the roof you'll sleep cooler up there wait when you took the zealot oath you took it for life I swore to love my country to work for her freedom I still will in the way I think best and that is each night I pray that Judea may be freed pray a hundred years of prayers haven't loosened our chains there's seven centuries of hate and plots and bloodshed perhaps our hope lies in forgiveness and not in revenge you sound like a follower of the Nazarene because I've become one Oh some rumors about and reached Jerusalem but you know city dwellers anything that happens outside the wall can't possibly be important but the farther north we came the more we heard about him the wildest tales of Curie's of healings driving out of demons half of Galilee is convinced he can do incredible things he can i witnessed several witnessed the wonder your message said he draws men like a lodestone the humble the weak the all but hopeless they talk on our searches ending the Nazarene is everything we need for a figurehead if a man who preaches love your enemy can be persuaded to join the Brotherhood give me time to gain his confidence and I'll have him thinking that revolt against Caesar is his own idea why has no more sense of intrigue than a child have you heard of the aides he's chosen for fishermen untold exactly for Calais handed scholars in the art of gutting fish now what a man with a slightest knowledge of politics surround himself with a retinue like that when I first heard of it they added a new one a tax collector he dines with him tonight at the home of Matthew been helped by the Levi's the ex carpenter with his ex fishermen something with an ex publican and half of the other tax collectors of Capernaum tell me we're not people were conquered before in centuries past what kept them together by their loyalty pride and their faith in God and who led them to freedom the Lord the great leaders he sent today they have neither they look to the throne for Hezekiah Solomon they find Herod Antipas we clean libertine pocket they turned to the temple and say another Roman porn kfs high priest by order of seasoned high priest high traitor to Israel making a mockery of his robes to enrich his press know other people have despaired of help from the temple all the throne leaving only their faith in the Lord faith but little hope of ever being part of his kingdom not with chaos demanding temple Taksin that only a few can pay another Nazarene appears offering redemption to all who repent salvation to all simply believe Rome recruits her armies by offering mere earthly loot how much more this carpenter of and they believe him and believe what they want to believe actually there's only one thing that might make the people hesitate to follow him one thing the humility born of a hundred years of slavery the humbleness that might make them say the kingdom is for others not for me I'm too lowly I'm unworthy but the Nazarene whose cleverness you derive proves that all men are worthy by the example of his chosen companions for fishermen and the publican it's possible I underestimated him it's also conceivable that you might have read too deep a meanie into a thoughtless act perhaps perhaps in either case you agree you can still be useful if he can be guided and control he can t he will be it must have been about that time when we cross to the far side of Galilee wrong followed him on foot along the northern shore in the early morning the master went up the mountain to pray I waited farther down the Mount with the others and when his prayers were ended he came to us and from among us he chose 12 James Barr's epi' T and his brother John my brother Simon called Peter and myself Matthew the publican young Philip Bartholomew Thomas the doubter James son of Alphaeus that is the man Simon who had been a zealot and Judas of Kiriath Judas and you I have chosen not alone that you may be with me but that you may go forth and preach of the kingdom of heaven you will be given authority over the spirits of evil the power to cure disease and heal all manner of sickness you are the light of the world blessed are the poor in spirit what theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are those who mourn but they shall be comforted blessed are the meek but they shall inherit the earth blessed are the merciful or they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart what they shall see God blessed are the peacemakers what they shall be called sons of God blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account rejoice and be glad or your reward is great in heaven or so man persecuted the prophets who were before you master this gentleman Simon a thousand breathing your kindness overwhelms me what good fortune brings you to Jerusalem I came with Jesus of Nazareth he's here in the city since last week just you and the Nazarene and the other followers there are 12 of us every day we're here Jesus speaks in the temple court I I wish that you would go to him listen to him I yes why's that I could tell the Brotherhood how to free Israel by learning to love our conquerors it's written that whoever sheds the blood of man by man shall his blood be I know the scriptures I know also that of all Judea followed your rabbis preachment of peace our future would be doomed or saved Simon you've chosen your way I am dedicated to mine even though we travel different paths the road that leads to the top of me bow first times the foothills heel so high that men mistake them for the pinnacle itself you ascend the hill toward a goal of earthly political freedom for our people it hides the greater gold beyond the spiritual salvation of all mankind taught which he strives you may find we travel the same Road Simon why are you so sure of him do you think he's the Messiah come to earth a year ago he was a village carpenter yet he has such knowledge power beyond any earthly explanation that all men who hear him trust and believe him all men all men who really know him he's at the temple now will you go there with me not today yes master Rooney I have an errand boy are you angry with me because on the Sabbath 5k demands all the spice merchants candles Greenland's file tell him I'll visit him soon as I can right judge he's waiting for you now hear o Israel the Lord our God the more thank you here my friend welcome my home is your hospitality honors me the boy said you wanted me at once something wrong the very question I was about to ask you I heard you arrived in Bethany a week ago I expected you to seek me out at once or I plan to come tonight it isn't too easy to slip away from the others without arousing their suspicions do they suspect you on the contrary they're just selecting the guardian of our purse keeper the funds excellent and the Nazarene what progress have you made with him he chose me one of the twelve yes you wrote me about that some months ago have you won him over to our cause persuaded him to take the zealot old I haven't so much as tried hmm no speaking too soon might have ruined everything that's the only reason what other could they do I've heard incredible things about him that he has supernatural gifts that he can persuade all men to his way of thinking and you thought that that I possibility occurred to me how do you explain his abilities by his own words but all powers and wonders come from God can we explain the Sun for the stars for the miracle of a sea becoming a flower no we accept so I accept the abilities of Jesus bar Joseph and if the credulous choose to think him touched by divinity and I suppose when the time comes and when it does we'll make some things off we'll have the Brotherhood spread the word that he's divine that he's a messiah a messiah why not once a revolt its excite forbid it he will be useful to us as a mortal leader only if he can be won over to our cause he will be when I have been wasted my time first I had to win his confidence now I begin to offer casual suggestions on an important later I advise our more vital Affairs by the time we actually need you're sure you can succeed all I need is enough time I met with the High Council of the Brotherhood two nights ago they sent orders to every zealot leader to lie low no raise no forest until Tiberius believes all Israel is subdued then if revolt strikes at Gore gothic I'm arrived it rose troops from these Garrison's here and I need a leader who teaches love and peace can increase his falling without suspicions if anyone first let him come to me and drink he who believes in me as the scripture has said out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water if you continue in my word you are my disciple and you will know the truth and the truth will make you free this is really the product you might even be the Christ the Christ to come from Galilee it is written that the Christ will be descended from David David comes from Bethlehem all you are is taxes and height he offers eternal life you don't care we stop you Roman yes Lord honest arrest this troublemaker take him to care for us yes follow mutro said rabbi from Nazareth tried to stir up the crowd again one who's caused so much trouble in Galilee there's always traveling Galilee but now he's starting it here you can end it Laura clip where's your prisoner we couldn't arrest him Courtney arrest him but no man has ever spoken like this man so now he's like Jew astray also go go well at least the Nazarene is gone and more importance than ever thanks to you important panelists wandering teacher wherever he wanders the people listen we follow people yes the people the ones we must control as Rome wants them controlled or be destroyed ourselves if you are so fearful of the Nazarene send out a stronger God have him dragged back lashed locked in a dungeon no he must be silenced more cleverly than that and in his own Galilee if he returns there who do we know in Capernaum that we can trust tell me rabbi this heaven you praise will it be the same for all of us truly I say to you unless you turn in become like children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven whoever humbles himself like this child he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven whoever receives one such child in my name receives me and whoever causes one of these little on the way never mind another room never fire Thanks keep going I'll be late woman of macula now the Galileans audience is complete they all open the way mistress ever read in the scriptures temptations to sin are sure to come but woe to him by whom they come and yet I tell you if a man has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray does he not leave the ninety and nine on the hills and go in search of the one that went astray and if he finds truly he rejoices more over it at over the ninety and nine that never went astray hi rabbi I've been listening to you with interest great interest I want to seek your advice privately if you and your friends here with honor me by dining tonight if you can that will do that will do you were in the market square this morning yes mistress so that's how you waste your time gaping and handsome young artists that one seemed quite a Spellbinder who is he Jesus by Joseph of Nazareth oh yes I've heard tales about him what is he a teacher a physician a mystic or a madman who thinks himself a prophet not a madman mistress some call him rabbi others term him master I've heard it whispered that he he might be the Messiah but he speaks of himself as the son of man like anyone else and you learned all of that from listening to him once I've heard him several times he seemed to have some great appeal for silly girls and stupid old women what can it be he he brings us hope hope that if we truly repent our sins and have faith we may be part of God's kingdom easy promise to me he means it and he knows if you could look into his eyes everyone someone to him not just a another face in a crowd and he has such kindness such understanding such sympathy for us all for everyone oh yes mistress for the rich and the poor for the powerful in the weak for the good and the name you almost said the wicked didn't you where everyone is just such a good girl art dutiful devout innocent high as they slave in your life away to support your crippled lover well I could have been a mealy-mouthed sit by the fire too but I chose to live my life and enjoy it how many of these is your purity bought for you hi Eddie

bit and then tell me you're wiser is smarter than I am over Lois I'm I'm sorry here take them keep them they're yours you must i order you to you don't have to keep them sell them if you what i won't mind use the money to hire the egyptian physician to cure your mother my mother's no longer crippled not since the day a Nazarene touched her with his hand you may go now I can agree with all that you say about love your enemies as well as your neighbors our only form what do you mean love or our enemies evil Roman tyrants who have enslaved us if all men love their fellow man there would be no tyrants and no slaves Oh Putin not but until that day come what it does there'll be no problem about loving Romans they're all be dead take the procurator's that rooms and to rule us Capponi as he wasn't too bad nor markers but honestly now can you say one good word about Pontius Pilate the sword rattling course soldier promoted ah who are you do you want how dare you come here get out well a woman of Magdala and another in stock market or he wouldn't let her touch him Simon I have something to say to you what is it rabbi a certain creditor had two daggers one owed him 500 in area the other 15 when they could not pay him he forgave them both now which of them will love him more the one I supposed to whom he forgave more you have judged rightly do you see this woman I entered your house you gave me no water for my feet but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair you did not anoint my head with oil but she has anointed my feet with ointment therefore her sins which are many are forgiven what she loved much but he who is forgiven little loves left last your sins are forgiven your faith has saved you good piece from that day on Mary of Magdala became one of us for the master letters she followed devoted tireless eager disturbed and the summer turned to fall we journey southward to Jerusalem we remained welcome at home in Bethany the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which a man found and covered up then in his joy then he goes and sells all that he has and buys that feat but how are we to find that King how Lazarus a scan it will be given you seek and you will find knock and it will be open to you or everyone who asks receives and he who seeks finds and to him who knocks it will be opened Mary all things are possible to God if you truly believe Mary oh your pardon master but there's so much to be done more than I can see to alone the Rhine to be poured and the meat to be cut and the servants are all master don't you care if my sister has left me to serve alone Martha Martha you're anxious and troubled about many things only one thing is needful mary has chosen the good portion which shall not be taken from master you say ask and will receive how shall we ask will you teach us to pray as John taught his disciples when you pray say our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name by kingdom come I will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil I'll bet Oh but that stay was short the time of the Passover was drawing near and a master plan to join the throngs they traveled to the temple in Jerusalem I passed through Capernaum before you left I was headed north you were all instructed to cease harassing the Romans but one man brought himself more important than the Brotherhood Barabbas camp from the hills had changed since I saw it last what once had been a refuge for the persecuted had now become a layer of bandits his men had captured a Roman supply Caravan the loot included a half dozen skins of strong wine in of Israel Patriots pledged to free Judea turn to brigands and swine under your leadership perhaps they'll be fit again tomorrow as soon as their heads clear in the Qatar but um have their fun they fought who bled and killed enough Roman not some freedom a gold and jewels stolen tents some portion masters a dock master spice merchant a toast a salute to the Brotherhood judge sweat didn't mean to spill no I just one to drink with an old friend you were ordered to avoid conflict with the Romans I built a following by giving orders not taking them men have come from all of Palestine to join me because they know the named Barabbas means courage and not appeasement appeasement you were told to lie low as part of a plan to take the Romans off guard when when everything was ready not until then not until then that's what they told my father in his youth and his father before him it's easy to sit in your fine house in Jerusalem and cry wait wait but when you've seen your village burned as I've done seen your wife and children cut down by Roman swords the decision of the High Council is a command suppose I choose to ignore the command of the timid Greybeards suppose I decide to attack the Roman outpost tomorrow and then sweep southward gathering an army as I go I forbid it you and your men have regained your senses return to your homes those are your orders I command of the council prepare the donkeys were starting back it's our guide our guests back to the caravan road I don't be mad at Mesmer Zadok he's a good man there's a beautiful garden I was just gardener once when I was hiding from can this be the famous Barabbas a great leader who so graciously accepted my gift what gift the last loot you'll ever steal six skins of drugged wine you take my advice you'll stay away from Jerusalem the BRABUS is executed and forgotten we don't want your counsel just your hell up with what three Barabbas with all the two of them oh it may be possible you know the procurator's customer freeing a prisoner on feast days yes but hardly Barrabas it may be Barabbas up for people demand it I've sent messengers to assemble the Brotherhood but some might not get there in time we'll have to fill the courtyard round the judgment-seat and that'll be your job mine yours with the army of pilgrims who follow your Galilean you can't convince him to add their voices to ours can't you I doubt it but you will try his powers aren't an army they're just people who want to be here well they would obey Him wouldn't they at all and if you wanted to persuade him is Jeb I not go give the boy his supper he hasn't eaten yet surely brute arts wrong Judas nothing you can't persuade him to help her now can't you and then any matter worth the effort two years ago you thought he'd be easy to control a year ago you wanted to use him as a false messiah now you hesitate to so much as ask a favor of him why you admit the BRABUS flats orders and jeers at Authority now he's a worth the free even we could be done he is thanks to Roman stupidity they paraded him the length of Palestine made a captive hero of a symbol to the people for the man I spent weary hours to cultivate does it become secondary to a cutthroat bandit from the hills never mind we'll have need of him the urgent task now is to free Barabbas and your duty is to help I'll do what I can the time will come toward the end of the Passover week Thursday perhaps Friday get in touch with me as soon as you reach Jerusalem I will good fortune there's a man I'd never count on and you'd be wrong men take those evidence for the score of reasons adventure revenge and ideal the hope of gain but Judas is bound closest of all he's possessed by a demon demon the devil of ambition the lust of power and authority he wants to be a leader he'd sell his soul for it but he knows he hasn't the spark now his aim is to be the power behind the throne Judis what have you been why just outside the village to visit a friend why the master and the others have gone I waited to tell you gone where to Bethany come on if we hurry we can overtake the messenger came from Mary and Martha Lazarus is ill Mary it was good of you to come master but we could not

mind what I it is written my house shall be called a house of prayer but you have made it a den of robbers Lizzy the guards where the guns no an ort but you could have in jail for such a jail he must be ignored or destroyed completely and only pilot can sentence Amanda death we could trick them into making a treasonous state neared west try what in colonial you think that true der man might I would suggest if you retain a teacher we know that you speak and teach rightly and show no partiality and truly teach the way of God but tell us is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not if he says don't give those sword swingers will arrest him for treason he says give he'll have the whole crowd against him come teacher what's your answer and that question show me your calling whose likeness and inscription are on it why Cetus then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that are gods greetings have you heard what happened today ah the Nazarene make fools of canvases pet toady's in the argument about the corn yes well he really seems their bids the story is being told all over the city yesterday he proved his courage by driving out the courtyard parasite single-handed now the masses although he is brilliant as well couldn't get here to help with the preparation still not how are they coming some of the men have arrived but not enough to fill the courtyard the courtyard oh no I didn't mean that I meant to arouse the people again Judas in a way it might be best to wait for as many of the Brotherhood as we can on the other hand we mustn't lose the people's excitement perhaps the last of the feast days would be right or do you think it should be done sooner not for a year at the earliest a year be tuned maybe never but that's ridiculous insane you heard how they cheered him they followed the very gate of the temple and I saw him weep and turn away well they remember that you did this you insisted upon me Barabbas the head of a master I didn't but I would have Judas now you listen to me all of you you're throwing away a kingdom we can't stir them up again or more easily than before no risk no risk at all well a blind man can see the care of his fears a Nazarene he doesn't dare order his arrest if k of us were fool enough to arrest him we could rouse the people then it'd have a cause to fight for a hero to free his enemies to destroy now they have neither and K if it's a shrewd enough to know that dangerous past a wise man faces facts only a fool denies them and only the cowardly stop one step short of victory alright give up hope all of you but I won't not now if games were fool enough to arrest him we could rouse the people and it'd have a cause to fight for a hero to free his enemies to destroy now them neither gave us a shrewd enough to know the dangerous past a wise man faces facts only a four denies them and only the Carly stop one step short of victory the first day when crowds Hilding King his courage failed he was afraid that you and the procurator laid a trap and now now a maneuvers tool of your fears when he's certain you're off guard you'll order his followers to strike at the temple that you do well as elet's assassinate Herod then as high priest and King he'll be in a position to bargain with Pilate if you've been as close to him as you say why are you betraying him I trusted him I thought it was Messiah now I see him for what he is will you repeat all this to the procurator no why not if it's the truth because you'll seize Jesus Pilate would put slaughter him and his followers to the last

Gentiles dwelling during their Passover they rouse me at dawn and expect me to come to them report Rickson our apologies what are you discussing see this man who brought what is he accused why he claims to be the Son of God he's a false messiah he even claims to be the Christ yes he calls himself a head without an evildoer we would not have handed him over Rome has no interest in your Christ's or messiahs take him to yourself judging by your law but it is not lawful for us to sentence a man to death if your excellency will merely endorse this rid of our judgment wait here what is slays if I say this is the man who caused that clamor four or five days ago yes excellency but nothing Carolyn something did not for care this to want him executed or to want me to execute him are you the King

from Galilee to this very city from Galilee see a Galilean yes known as Jesus of Nazareth and he comes under Herod's jurisdiction not mine head on excellent gene and Terry yes excellency take the prisoner to the temple any move of care versus maybe a chap I love them detest it he knows it hates me plots night and day to discredit me with wrong he knows time to resorted me to keep the peace at any cost yet he asked me to execute a man whose followers may revolt why didn't you release the man so campus could send what a decision that I'd freed the man who had set himself up as king in defiance of Rome oh I see housing the problem under Herod with a clever move a statesman smoove divided a free hand in order to keep the peace I'd order the Galilee and beheaded all his followers with him then I turned the courts loose on the temple I'm Caiaphas when all the fat cats is around him well did Herod find the man guilty no excellency the prisoner refused to answer the tetrarch's questions so Herod mocked him draped him in a torn purple robe and sent him back back but he's a Galilean so I told him excellency but Herod claims the crimes were committed in Judea in your jurisdiction so headed plots against me to please my lord it may be the carrot fears the same thing to you Tom's more more good news only the campuses join the delegation awaiting your Excellencies

may know I find no crime in him right they own the man I got here we brought the man the fear we could if you release this man you are not Caesars friend everyone who makes himself King sets himself against Caesar it is the custom every Passover for one prisoner to be released shall I pre this one whom you hailed is your king or this rather murderer known as Barabbas Barabbas free Bharata what should I do with Jesus who is called Christ crucified what evil has he done I am innocent of this man's blood see to it yourselves release Barabbas it is better far better but one man should die and the Peace of Israel be maintained I have said that betraying innocent blood see to it yourself you if you can perform miracles do one he claims he can save others let's see if he can save himself save yourself now if you go other forgive well they know not what they do least you breath forgiving them truth Christ save yourself save us don't you fear God you and I were dust ly condemned we are receiving the dew rewards for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong Jesus remember me when you come in to your kingdom Fuli i stated today with me in paradise as Judas been found what is the sign say since Jesus of Nazareth King of Lagoon no pilot had it put there as a JIRA cams you never know how close to the truth that just came out loud here go back this is a Nazarenes mother hope behold bye son my father my god my god by this alpha city I thirst you but into thy hands I commit my spirit it is finished and so he died and proved himself a mortal man not a divine messenger not the Messiah that but some people thought he might have been and for these two days since his death pilots cohorts have combed the city seeking the leaders of a revolt that never took place and a Roman guard stands watch over a sealed tomb that contains the body of the man who might have been our King the guard has been removed Nazarenes body was stolen when the woman went to the tomb this morning for the ritual anointment the stone was rolled aside the body gone they came back to tellus trying to convince themselves that he had risen like Lazarus talking about some vision they saw or thought they saw my brother went to the tomb there was nothing there but the grave cloths that's the story now you know why you were summoned why we failed I understand I must be getting back to my companions and I to my men my thanks for your help my friend and mine for the shelter you go towards the Damascus Gate in that direction some of us will go with you this is where I must leave you may we meet again someday under better circumstances for all of us I'm sorry I didn't know the Nazarene as you did he was a brilliant man and a brave one we may never find another to regrow I am some of the others believed he was the Messiah once I thought so too what if he had been the Messiah he wasn't he died was suppose he had been what then then Simon would have been right when he said we both travelled the same road you and I to the foothills and he to the great of pinic or beyond there well my friend may the Lord watch between me and thee while we are absent one from the other Oh I sent Thomas to find you where have you been hiding from the Romans it's all right now have you decided what we will do not yet we'll talk about that later I'm safe we'll all go back to Galilee together Galilee won't be easy telling knows who stay behind just a week ago we came into the city with all the people hailing him is king peace be with you Master can't be master no it's a spirit why are you troubled why do questionings rise in your hearts master is it really you see my hands and my feet that it is I myself handle me and see or a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have Messiah the Messiah thus it is written that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the be and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations Oh
