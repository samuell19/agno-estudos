[drum roll] [rousing fanfare] - People of the city of Gubbio! Hear ye, hear ye! On the orders of His Excellency Lorenzo Landi, founder and benefactor of our city, on this 13th day of April in the year of our Grace fifteen hundred and twenty-one, will begin the trial and judgment of the following named defendants: Sister Angelica of the Sisters of Charity; Madonna Violetta de' Bardi; Lisa Martini; and Bettina Rimondi; all of them having been involved in certain disgraceful scandals that are a vicious assault on public morality. At the express wish of the prosecuting magistrate and defense counsel, for reasons of safeguarding public decency, this trial will be conducted in complete secrecy. No visitors are allowed. [crosier clanks] - This court is now in session. [scribe groans] [scribe grunts] - As you already know, gentlemen, my esteemed friend and colleague was unfortunately taken to jail, so I have taken his place for this trial. And I admit, because I had very little prior notice, I was not able to make a complete and detailed examination of the briefs. I would therefore ask prosecuting counsel to give us a summary of the facts in question so that everybody here is brought up to date. File in the prisoners. Prisoners, be seated. May I ask why so many defendants are being tried at once? Are their cases in some way all connected? - Well, Your Honor, it's like this. Knowing the facts as well as I do, it's... Well, in this case I would advise Your Honor to look under the table for the answer- - You mock the course of justice and the position I hold? - I'm sorry, Your Honor. - Excuse me, Your Honor, but I think maybe he's got a point. - I do not want to hear your opinion. Ask if you wish to talk and wait till I give permission. - I apologize, Your Honor. It won't happen again. - Your Honor, I'm afraid that the cases presented here today are somewhat confusing to explain clearly. In certain basic aspects, they are identical. But if Your Honor agrees, I would prefer to take each one separately. It'll make the matter of passing judgment easier. I feel greatly confident that the truth that Your Honor's conclusions will surely reveal in its entirety shall support all the facts. Do I make myself clear? - Clear as an Irish bog. So now that I've heard your sermon, you may proceed with the case. - The charges in this case were initiated by Enrico Baldazzi, whose statement I have here, Your Honor. They're against Sister Angelica, a novice at the convent of Santa Cunegonda in Foligno. She... - That is not in the least amusing. - I always get corny when I can't see. I can't find my glasses. - There they are! - Thank you. - Proceed with the case, please. - This statement by Mr. Enrico Baldazzi starts with a full accounting of what occurred the last night before Sister Angelica took her vows, Your Honor. [tranquil music] - Enrico. Rico, my darling. Rico? Riccetto! - Huh? Where's the fire? - This is the last night we can be together and you sleep and ignore me! - I wasn't sleeping. I just wanted a little rest. Anyway, what do you expect of me? We've made it at least 80. - 61, I've been counting. - 80. - 61. - 80. - 61! - 80! - 61! - 80! - 61! - All right, dammit. 63. You know what, Tessa? You are, without any doubt at all, the most bitchy, demanding, pigheaded, presumptuous, know-it-all woman that I ever had the terrible misfortune to lay eyes on. - You really love me, Riccetto? Do you swear it? - Oh, darling! Please stay with me. - It is impossible, a vow is a vow. And besides, my parents would kill me. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - It's not important. I'll die if you me. - Oh, please don't die. You won't be able to make love to me anymore, Rico. - You're right. I'm so dumb-assed. I never thought about that. Eh. Well, then I'll live on. But I swear to God, nothing will come in between us, darling. No matter where you are, I'll find you. I'll search to the very ends of the Earth. - It's dawn. - It is? - You'd better leave now, Rico. Goodbye, darling Rico. Don't catch cold. - I won't, sweetheart. And away! [water splashes] - [Tessa] You forgot your shoes! [solemn organ music] [singing in Italian] - She's like a beautiful angel. A vision of holiness. [bell chiming] [choir harmonizing] [bells ring] [bishop speaking Italian] [bishop speaking Italian] - Welcome to the Sisters of Charity. In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, amen. - [Woman] She looks as pure as a driven virgin, doesn't she? - Hey, Marco! - Give it here! - [Boy] Oh, give me it! [laughs] Come on. Take that, fella. [boy laughs] - Hey, come on. Join us, Rico. - No, there's more to life then playing. One does not live by ball alone. - [Boy] Hey! Come on! Over here, over here! - [Boy] Go get it. - Are you Riccetto Baldazzi? - Why? - I have a message from one who is in your heart. - Tessa? - No, the good Sister Angelica. That is her name now. - You've seen her? Please tell me, is she suffering very much? - If you want an answer out of me, you must calm yourself. - I'm all right now. Go on. - She's crazy about you. - Yes? Yes? - And she wants to see you. - Oh my god! When though? - This very night, at the convent. - [sighs] At the convent. How do I get into the convent? - In the dark it's easy. And the wall around isn't very high. And, well, we'll arrange everything. - Huh? How do you mean? - You'll find some big nails in the wall so you can climb up to her window. It's the second on the right when you stand facing the convent. - Hmm. But the window has bars. - Do you mean I have to spell it out for you? - Naturally. Else how will I know? - I'm very shy. - Close your eyes then. Does it feel better that way? - Hmm. Well... Yes, I think it does. There's a bar that runs along, over the window. That's for you to hold on with your hands. Hold on tightly and put your... Body against the window, the full length of the bars, then- - Then put it inside. You must mix them until they're blended well, [nuns giggle] the way one mixes pastry, folding it layer over layer. This, I admit, is very good, but with cinnamon it's much better. - As usual, you're late, Sister Angelica. - I felt faint all day. I apologize. - Nothing serious, I hope. - A spiritual strain, that's all. Of meeting you. It affected me emotionally. - You are very sensitive, Sister. Sit over here, next to me. [Tessa gasps] Sit down. You'll soon feel all right. - I'll try. - As we were saying, Your Excellency? - About what? - That corruption and sin are a terrible menace these days. Discipline and order are simply empty words that are heeded no longer. If the world is allowed to go on the way it is, then very soon it will be on the brink of disaster. It is our duty as messengers of the lord to lead the people off the road to hell and onto the path of righteousness. Your Excellency? - Yes? - We really have to leave you. It is time for prayer. - Go with the grace of God. - The same to you, Father. [lively music] [Enrico whistles merrily] [water splashes] - Are you scared or something? - Scared? No. You ever know me scared? - No. All right, come on, Dodo. - Listen, Riccetto. Maybe you'd rather I wasn't here, huh? - What the hell makes you think that? - You'd be better off alone. - I need someone to warn me of danger. - But who's gonna warn me, huh? - Let's go, dumbbell. - I'm Dodo. [lively music] - Careful! - [yelps] There's someone coming! - She's here to help us, you asshole! - This way, come on. - Yeah! Dipshit! - Dodo. - Quiet! That's the window, up there. She's waiting for you. - Yeah! I could break a leg. - Hey! You want me to do it, Rico? - Don't even joke about it or I'll break your leg! And besides, it's not very difficult. [hums heroically] And keep your eyes open. [Enrico yelps] [Dodo nickers] I was only fooling. - I didn't say a thing. [suspenseful music] [Dodo whimpers] Tessa! [yelps] [Dodo gulps] It's me, my darling. - We don't have much time, so let's not waste a second. Did Cielo explain to you how? - Yeah, sure. [gulps] - Think of me while you're hanging out there. - I will. [Tessa moans softly] Am I hanging right? - Come on in. And be quiet! [nuns gasp] He'll hear you! Cut the noise down or you're going to ruin everything! Get in line. Settle down. [nuns giggling] Riccetto? - Yes? - Are you ready? - Doesn't it look like it? - Yeah. You first. Come on. - Here I am, my darling. [nun sighs] - Answer me! [nuns gasp] All right! All of you, out of here. I shall speak to you about this later. - Tessa! Can you hear me? I want to get down! - [sighs] God has been kind to you. - Please, Tessa. - Just what I wanted! [Enrico yelps] - Let me pray. Yea, though I walk through the valley, uh... Uh, uh... [Abbess sighs] - I thank you for opening my eyes to this, Sister. Sometimes man is prevented from seeing the naked truth. He can't see the woods for all the trees. He is blinded. - The truth is naked, Your Excellency. [soft music] - The truth is that you're a great piece of ass, Sister. - The lord is with me, I shall fear no evil. For his... His... His... Rod and staff, they comfort me. [gasping] And... [Enrico screams] [Dodo whimpers] - Rico Baldazzi? - Yes, Your Honor? - Do you recognize this woman known as Sister Angelica of the Sisters of Charity? - I do, Your Honor. And I'll kill the bitch. I'll kill the conniving bitch! Let me at her! I'll kill her! Let me go. Let me go! I want to kill the lying bitch! Let me go! - There appear to be no doubts in this case. - Wait a moment, Your Honor. I prefer to complete the rest of my exposition first. It'll be much easier for you to make your decision then. I guarantee that if you will grant me this, Your Honor, then the problems you face here will be resolved much more easily. - That all makes sense. All right, go ahead. - The accusation is extortion against two persons. That's what's written here, anyhow. The defendant is Lisa Martini, present in court. The story that resulted in this charge is as follows, Your Honor. - [Eugenia] Lisa! Lisa! Where the devil are you, girl? Lisa! [Lisa sighs] - Bitching old bag, she is. - Lisa! Why aren't you ever where you should be, Lisa? I might just as well be on my own. - I was putting the washing out to dry. - Why, just at the moment I need you, you're always doing something, dear girl? Now help me, Lisa. - I really must go and get- - To hell with that! - Please forgive me, dearest one. I ordered Lisa to prepare lunch. I have a most important meeting at the bank this afternoon and I don't want to keep my colleagues waiting. In that case, then, I'll have to come to lunch completely nude. [bright music] What is it, darling? Aren't you satisfied? - No, I'm sick and tired of having to meet you like this. Eight times a month is hardly satisfying. - Aw, so that's what the matter is. - Is it enough for you? - Hmm. - What's this about? - It's your letter of presentation, darling, certifying that you're a top-rate butler. - Who wrote it? - It isn't important. A friend of mine. The important thing is you got the letter. - You did this especially for me? - Not quite. I did it for us both, my darling. - I think I will retire early. Today has really been... [yawns] Very tiring, you know, dear. - Lisa? Did you prepare my room, yet? - Yes, my lady. - And my husband's, Lisa? - No. Bitto did, my lady. - Oh, by the way, Lisa, tell me, what do you think of our new acquisition? - Well, sire, if you really do need to hear my poor, humble opinion, I get the impression that he's as queer as a clam. - [gasps] My dear girl, where did you get that idea? - Well, sire, a woman can tell. The proof is that since he arrived in the house, he hasn't given me more than a single cursory glance. - What do you mean, Lisa? Are you trying to turn my house into a- - "Whorehouse" is the word, dear. - Oh, woman! You're disgusting! I forbid you to say such things in my house! - Oh, your language is monstrous! - Thank you, Lisa. I find your opinion of Bitto very interesting. Goodnight. - Goodnight, my lady. [suspenseful music] [Estoffo snoring] - Eugenia? [suspenseful music] - Appearances are misleading, sire. Or so the philosophers say. - I know, but why do you? - Because I have a good pair of eyes to see with, sire. And I often see more than others. - Oh? What are you trying to say, Lisa? Do you know something about my wife that I don't? - Oh, sire, I have never been one for vicious idle chatter. Words don't mean anything on their own. They are not the proof that seeing with your own eyes is, are they? - Tell me how you can prove it. - By showing you. For 20 scudo. - Are you sure you have something to show me? - Certainly, sire. You will see. [knock at door] - Yes? - Open the door, Lisa. It is I. [suspenseful music] - Come on. Now you'll see. They're already there. - I go in the cupboard too? - There's a hole in the wall. Here, I'll show you. - That's my wife, I know it! That's her bottom all right! - I'm glad you recognize it. - What about him? How did he manage to get into the house? - The door behind the stable. It's never locked. - But who is he? - I don't know. It's not really important, is it? - Important? Of course it is! No, it's not. Not at all! Whoever it is I'll kill when I get... [shouts] [Lisa yelps] [Estoffo grunting] - Excuse me for intruding, sire. I didn't realize you'd be here. I apologize. [Lisa gasps] - Don't leave. No, wait a minute, come back here. I wasn't, uh... I wasn't doing anything. I was, uh... I was simply taking a walk around the house. - That's obvious, sire. The cupboards too? - Oh, what have the cupboards got to do with it? You wouldn't be thinking that maybe Lisa and I- - No! No, nothing like that. Others would, I think. But I, no. - What do they know, these others? - Nothing as yet, sire. But you know how, uh, word spreads. - I can prevent is spreading, can't I? It can be stopped can't it? - It takes money to do that. - Hmm. How much? - Five scudos a word. - And how many words could spread? - Oh, about six. "Estoffo Demarto is screwing his servant." - Hmm. 30 scudos. It's all for a good cause. - And how much would you pay for, uh... What shall we do with that bastard who screws your wife? - I'm going to kill the bastard, understand? It'll be a pleasure and I'll do it! - Wait, sire. You have a good reputation. You're a very important citizen of this town. So why not allow me to do it instead? Let me eliminate this intruder. - You mean you'll do this for... For me? - With pleasure, sire. And you know I wield a pretty good sword. And such an incident can be explained quite easily. I caught a robber in the house and we fought. That way your wife won't be included in the matter. Everything will be normal, just as it was. I await, sire, only your permission. - Oh. That'll earn you... Um, 30 scudos. [Bitto laughs] [husband grunts] 50 scudos. - Thank you. - But I want to watch you when you do it. Through that hole. - I don't see anything against it, sire. Tomorrow night. - Hmm. - [gasps] Are you quite mad? What if anyone should come in? - Don't put on that act of modesty with me, Eugenia. I have good reason to be here. And your husband is out at least until midday. - Couldn't you have waited? I'll be seeing you tonight. - Sure I could. But you couldn't, my sweet. - What does that mean exactly? - Your husband knows all about your nightlife. - Are you certain? - As certain as I'm here with you, Eugenia. - Oh, dear god. How did he find out about it? - Cut out the histrionics. There is one way we can save the situation. - What's that? - I'm going to need 50 scudos. And your full cooperation. - I'd like to know why you want the scudos. - To buy a sword for myself. And to organize a special show. - All right. What's your plan? - The scudos. Hmm. - All right, now then? - Tonight you come to my room. [Estoffo growling] - [Eugenia] Who is it? [Estoffo laughs] Bitto! What are you doing here? Get out at once! - You'll pay the price for this! Pay with your life! [Estoffo cackles] You scoundrel! Prepare to die! - No! Leave him alone. He's not a fighter. - Kill the bastard. That's it. Lovely. Run him through. Go on! - It'll be a pleasure to kill you. Take that! [Bitto whimpering] [Estoffo laughs] Run, coward! Run! And remember this: if you make the mistake of ever returning again, I shall show no mercy! Ah! - Well, you mark my words, that's done the trick. If he has an ounce of brains in his head, he won't come back. - [Lisa] Wait, sire. - Huh? - Give her enough time to return to her room. - Oh. Well, what shall I say to her? - Nothing, and be assured that I will see that Bitto stays silent about it. - All right. Huh? - Treat her gently, I beg of you. After all, she is your wife. And you love her still. - Very well. I will do as you suggest. Lovely. [hiccups] [tranquil music] Eugenia. I've been thinking... That in fact it wouldn't be immoral to sleep in the same bed together. If you would like to, that is. [sentimental music] [Lisa and Bitto laughing] - 130 scudos! Know what? I'm beginning to think that we're pretty much on the ball! [both laugh] - I agree I am, yes. Why don't prove that you are too? [laughs] - Huh? [Bitto howls] [Lisa laughs] [Bitto growling] [ominous music] - Oh yes, certainly, Your Honor. I know her, all right. That's her, Lisa Martini. She's one of our servants. A disgraceful girl with morals like a donkey! - Who's brought charges of complicity against her colleague, Bitto Ragnelli. - Then she's lying, Your Honor! She's lying. Bitto is an honest, worthy boy. I guarantee his character myself personally. - Then in that case the charges of complicity are found invalid, sir. - [Magistrate] The accused is free to leave. - I don't know how to thank Your Honor. - Prosecutor, will you please proceed? - In this case the defendant is charged by her husband, a Francesco de' Bardi. He accuses Violetta, his wife, of multiple adultery, Your Honor. - Multiple? - Well, that's how it's written here. Maybe the evidence will explain it better, Your Honor. - [Francesco] Five and five, I get a point. - Shit! - I told you. - It's a jinx, that's all. - It ain't that. At dice you're as stupid as a cockroach's toe. [dice rattle] Not again! - Too bad, huh? Next time you'll get a double. - Ah! Eh. Hey. Come on, hurry up. - Wait a minute. [dice rattle] Ah! These two wooden witches' warts, they hate me! - What the hell does it matter? We're all getting rewarded. - What are you saying, goat head? You're not to say anything about that. - What are you worried about? - She listens to everything we say. She doesn't miss anything. - There's nothing to worry about out, as long as the barn door isn't left open. - Quiet, you fool! - You, ooh, ooh... Oh. Yeah. Well. - You drink the wine like sponges. Now you four busters have had enough. - Go to bed, dammit, or just keep still. Besides, it's getting very late. - I'm sick of going to bed and waiting there for you. And that's the truth! - She's just joking! - And it's your fault, you and your friends. I'm tired of going to bed alone! - Aren't there any letters you could write? What about your mother? - What I go through isn't fair! The four of you get to do this night after night. You love to play dice and get bloated from your drinking. It can't go on any longer. I'm sick of it. I want to make love. I want to feel like a woman again. - Go do bed! - I will not! Maybe you don't know it, but it gets a little boring. What have these three idiots got that I haven't? - [Francesco] These three idiots are our guests. And this is not a subject to discuss in front of them! - And don't you imagine their wives are complaining as much as I am? They treat them the same way. Maybe you don't think that our feelings are very important, except that we're totally sick to death of it. - That's quite enough! - Now then, you'll go to bed without further discussion. That's an order. - An order? - You heard me. Go to your room now. - An order, huh? [chuckles] Then goodnight! - It's madness, I think. - My wife's exactly the same. - I don't suppose that- - Quite the same. - And mine. - Although... She'll calm down. - Hmm, she's bound to calm down. - Yeah. No point in worrying. - Another drink? - Thank you. Well. - Right. - What? - Yes. - Whose turn? - Filippo. - I gotta win. Or at least this time. A little luck for your papa. [soft music] - That's enough. Now it's time for some action. - Right. - Who gets first crack? - Francesco won the most. He's the first to go. Next one to go is Marco, then Filippo, then me. - You're the last man? Well, don't worry. We'll all grease the waves for you. - You go to the devil. - I'll be along shortly. Don't start anything before I get there. [Marco sighs] [lively music] [suspenseful music] - Right, left, right, left. Left, right, left, right. Left, right, left. Right, and... Halt. - Hey, what are you shouting cadence for? You want everyone to know we're here? - She's deaf and dumb. Who the hell else is there? Where you going? - Where's he going? - Keep quiet. Shh. - Where's Francesco? [Marco whistles] - Ah. Look as those deaf and dumb dimples. Hey, she's tall. You know, I never saw her standing. - [Marco] Let me in there. - Let you in where? - There. - Where? - There! - No, not there. - The window, stupid. I wanna see. Ooh! - Nice frock. - Valentina, I think. - No, Valentina's are usually fitted at the waist. - It's a pleated bodice and that means a Valentina. - You're wrong! If it was a Valentina, the drape would be cut at the bodice! - Hey! - There he is! - Francesco! What the world have you been doing? - Certain body functions are private. Just a minute. Just a minute now! What the devil is the question, huh? - Hurry up, otherwise I'm gonna lose my whole interest by the time you get yours started. [Francesco singing nonsense] [Francesco groans] [Francesco singing nonsense] - When's it my turn? I'm not made of marble, so hurry! - I am. - It's about time. - All right, friends. You all know what to do. - We all know what to do. The problem is you guys take too much time doing it. Now get in there and don't be long! - That's what I'm famous for. I've never been long. - Hey, you know, with that one, you suppose she'll even know he's in there? [laughs] - Good evening. It's just little, short me. [bright music] - Have you girls finished blah-blah-blah'ing? It's all just talk, it doesn't do any good. Talk does none of us any good. To try to reason with them is pointless. As if they cared how we feel. Then you tell us, how do we fight this? Just go and join a convent, huh? - First let's try a monastery. - I've already decided what to do. - What are you saying? - It's right to the point and simple, I think. And though I know they'll get angry, it might be fun in the end. This plan's a beauty. - I won! I'll precede you all, yup! - Oh, you see that? Now you're afraid I'll beat you. You know I'm gonna beat you. [suspenseful music] - You. Hmm? You understand? Huh? [lively music] Here. - Come on! God dammit, you manage to score every time those things are in your hand. - Remember that no one loses in the end. - Mm-hmm! - Shh! - [Marco] Well, let's go. - I said no. We gotta wait. [lively music] - I go first. - I don't know. - Wait till tomorrow night. It'll be your turn then, okay? - I guess. - If you spoil it by one bit of noise- - [Wives] Mm-mm. [Francesco hiccups] - Sleeping already. - Well, I guess I'll have to wake her up in my usual manner. Hey, fellas, you know something? I've decided I've been much to soft on my wife lately. What do you think? - Oh. - Oh! [Francesco singing nonsense] - Little Miss Muffet. [chuckles] I've come to share your tuffet. - Claro. - Hmm? - You know? This may astound you, yet tonight was really extraordinary. - That so? - Yeah. - Hey! [men grunt] - Huh. [bright music] [Violetta singing merrily] - And there. [Violetta laughs softly] - What's the matter with her? Hmm. Seems like she's gotten a lot younger. - All women are strange. My wife suddenly spends her time singing all day long. - When I got up today, my wife right away said, "Good morning, dear." I mean, after four years, why would she do that? - What's so very strange in all this? A woman is happy when she's loved. It's time you knew it. - Oh? - What is it that you're trying to tell us, dear? That you have a lover in the house? - I might. The question is who? - Who? - Right here there are four good men. But it couldn't be one of us. Who has the opportunity? - Yeah. - That depends. Have yourselves another drink. - Yes! - I'll bet your all really good at dice. And of course you are, Francesco. You're probably the best of all. Goodnight, everyone. Oh, I meant to tell you. If I'm not awake and you need anything when you come up, please don't stand on ceremony. Well, goodnight. - [yelps] Hey! - [Claro] She's getting better every night. It's hard to explain. - Yeah, isn't it? It's so hard. I agree, yet... It... I mean, uh- - Yeah, that's probably the only way to put it. - I mean it's really hard! - Very hard! - Very hard. - Hard! - Yeah, that's for sure. I mean, boy, if we stop playing dice, we could spend more time with her. - Quiet! - Gentlemen, I must admit tonight I've had it and I've loved it. All right, Number Two, it's all cleared for you. - Go to the devil. [bright music] Hey. [grunts] Why don't we try changing positions? - I don't mind. [Violetta chuckles] - You! - Me. But, you mean you and- - Now, there are only six positions that we are offering tonight. You gotta obey the rules. - You've been taking positions? What exactly do you do? - Well, on Tuesday I'll be prone. - But you said that... You're admitting this. My god, you mean you freely admit you've been prone to us every Tuesday? - And the pleasure for us is the pleasure of seeing the client served well. You know, you ought to come on Friday. I'll be back again. - Back again. Back again? And tomorrow? - Saturday is Maria's turn. - You hussy! - That's not gonna work. You realize it's no trouble at all to scream. [screams] - Shit! Wait. Let us not get angry. Now you tell me the truth. Is this your doing? - Certainly. Mine and Antonia's and Maria's- - This is incredible. I should... I should... You... This is blatant debauchery! - Oh, I know. I'll bet you enjoyed it. And your friends. Let's call them. Do I call? - Hold your tongue! I need to think. - [Violetta] Is there any solution? - Hmm. Leave it to me, child. - Ah! I'm very hopeful. You'll find it, dear. [Violetta sighs] - All right, it's time to climb into the saddle. - Whoa, whoa, wait. What's the hurry? Wait. Maybe another drink or two, eh? - You crazy? I don't understand you. I can't wait any longer. I'm thinking of a better position. - Eh, no. - What do you mean, "Eh, no"? - We can't have that. She's got the right to choose. I mean, it's not necessary to bother her. She might not feel like changing. - Huh? - Huh? Why not? - It's a sin. Really, don't you see? Are you blind? - Listen, my friend, you're about the last person who should start worrying about my sins, I can tell you. You worry about you. - I do. For what I've done. - Listen. You know what's the matter with you? You've had too much wine. You're acting crazy. Let's go, come on. She's waiting. - Who the hell are you supposed to be then? The last Puritan? [ladies giggling] - There we are. They're coming! Hurry. Remember, the same old position. [men singing merrily] - Sir! - Sir, you? [Marco laughs] ♪ Position number six they say is just as good as nine ♪ ♪ But if you want some licks, to combine them is divine ♪ - To hell with propriety. Now for some variety! [Claro screams] [Francesco gasps] - Huh. Maybe she bit him. Or better! [Francesco sighs] Antonia! Vicious vixen. Vengeance is mine, foul, filthy swine! - [Claro] Come off it, Marco! - [Marco] Double trouble-dealing devil! - Come off it, Marco! - [Marco] Insidious, perfidious, invidious! - [Claro] Come off it, Marco! - Hey, who invited you here? [ladies laugh] - I'm not double-double trouble-dealing! You are! - Oh yeah? Yeah? [ladies laughing] - [Filippo] Put me down! Put me down! - [Claro] You mindless beast! You slimy, grimy, two-timing rogue! [Antonia screams] - [Filippo] You missed! [Filippo screams] - You knew about this, didn't you? That's why you didn't want to go along! - Marco, don't be too hasty. There's a logical explanation. [Marco grunts] [Francesco groans] [ladies laugh] [Francesco growls] [ladies laughing] - Watch this. - Yeah? - Watch this! - Yeah? - Watch this! - Yeah? [ladies laugh] [Francesco groans] - Is that all? - No, there is still another case to go, Your Honor. The charge was brought by Salvatore Anselme against his wife Betta for stimulating a miracle. - [Magistrate] Stimulating what exactly? - I mean simulating a miracle, Your Honor. And I will now tell you all the facts. [brooding music] - Ha! Where is she? - In the house, sire. She's been there all morning. - All morning, huh? - Yes, sire. If I should find out that one of you has been lying, I'll stamp his face into the mud of Earth! Is that clear? - Yes, sire. - Get back to work. Betta! Betta? - What do you want? [Salvatore laughs] - You're all alone? - Who do you think would be here? - Well, I don't know. But I ever discover anyone... - How, when I spend each and all day closed in this house like a prisoner, if I'm not even allowed any friends, if I'm not even permitted to put my head out of the window to breathe, tell me, how could I possibly do anything wrong? - The smell of men around here is really very strong. - That's easy to explain. You stink. - Oof. Well? - The saintly one, Master Salvatore. It's Friar Lucci who's coming and he'll want the usual. - All right, I'll come down. Now that is a real man. Actually... [laughs] He's not really a real man. He's a monk who thinks of God and miraculous miracles. Move, girl. Bring him some bread and nuts. - Brothers of this life, peace be yours forever, friends. - Father Lucci, please say a prayer for me. My olives have been dying. - Everything must die in this world, my son, even your olives. It is the will of our lord. - All of our crops are failing, Father. Can you not somehow dispel this curse that is on us? - It will dispel itself when you no longer sin. At least that's the general idea. On our day of judgment we shall all receive a key that will open one of two doors. Each of us will receive the key he merits: the one to heaven, or the one to heaven. [angelic choir harmonizes] - I trust that God accompanies you, Friar Lucci. My wife is bringing bread and nuts, as is our tradition. - Thank you, Brother Salvatore. The good lord will take note of it. - You're a ray of light, Father Lucci. Here is the food. I would offer you a great deal more if I could. - I understand, sister. I shall come back and whistle for more in the very near future. - I shall bake another loaf for you tonight. - Thank you, sister. God be with you. Peace be upon you. God be with you, my brothers. - Whoa! - Oh, thank you. - Wait a moment, you. Listen here. Why did you lay hands on her? - I caught her as she was about to fall, sire. That's why. - Don't give me any of that lying shit. Let's hear it. What's the truth, huh? How often have laid- - Sire, I swear! - No! - What's the matter, Betta? - What's the matter? What's the matter, you ask me? My god, maybe you'd understand if you heard the way you talk. I cannot take another of your miserable accusations. I cannot live another day being treated like a whore! It isn't jealousy! It's the sick, sordid working of a brain that's beyond all help! - Ah. Then what are your intentions? - As yet I don't know. I'll decide. Maybe I'll just go and commit suicide. Then at least I won't be near you! - Aw, fiddlesticks. What are you staring at? Go on now. Get back to work. You heard! Back to work. [sheep bleats] [Lucci whistles] [Salvatore snoring] [Lucci whistles] - There you are. Oh! Have you worked out a plan yet? - Yes. Put this on quickly and give me your nightdress. - Oh, thank you. - Hurry, come on. Give it to me. - Oh, and the ring. - All right, let's go. [suspenseful music] - Hello, dear. Betta! Huh? She's with a man! [growls] I'll kill him! Where's my sword? Ah. Hmm, needs sharpening. A knife will do as well. Maria! Carlo! Alberto! - What is it, sire? - What's happened? - Betta's gone! - Jesus! - Mother of God! - Well, what have they got to do with it? Find Betta! - We will, sire, don't worry. Betta! Betta! [Maria shouts] - What's wrong? Where are you? - The well! - I want Betta, I don't want a drink! - Over there, sire. Her ring. And her nightdress! - She committed suicide. - She warned us she was going to do it, Master Salvatore. It's just what she said she'd do! - Shut your face, you stupid girl. She committed suicide. [whimpers] Betta, my poor Betta. Please don't leave me alone like this. Poor me, I don't have anyone to be jealous about now. - I suppose I'd better go down and pull up the poor girl's body. - There's a spell on the well, you'd be crazy to go. Not even your soul could survive. They say it's the devil's home. - This well is to be abandoned until the day that I go to heaven. It'll stand as a monument to my dear sainted lady. Betta... [bright music] - Is it much further to the monastery? I'm beginning to droop a little. - We're nearly there. It's just over the top of that hill. But if you want to take a breather- - I think maybe I should. Oh! Ah! - What is it? - I sat on a padlock is what it is. - Ah, let's have a look. - Tell me something. Why do you always say that both keys open doors to heaven and not one to hell and damnation? - Because this one opens the one in front. [Betta laughs] And this one the one in the rear. - You're a dirty old man. - You insult me after I've liberated you? - Don't give me that story. - You're not showing respect for my cloth. - I respect what's underneath it though. [Betta laughs] [bright music] [soft music] [Lucci groans] - Are you aware of what you've done, Brother? - You betrayed the sacred vow of chastity. - You have offended your creator and judge. - Brother, we could excommunicate you. - She's a great lady. - She is, is she? You wouldn't want- - Oh no, I wasn't suggesting- - To worsen your position by adding the sin of greed, would you? - Oh, no, no, no, no, I wouldn't, only I'll have to have a few words with her, ask her. - Oh, naturally, Brother. Off you go. He can't afford to fire all of us. Spread it around. - Are you sure? - [laughs] Yes. - You're sure? - Absolutely, Brother. - She's, uh, agreeable. But there's one condition. - What? - She wants us to give her a room, Brother, at the convent. - A room for her? - Yes! - At the convent. At the convent! But of course! [gasps] Why, she could live with us! At the convent! What a wonderful idea! No, wait! Just a minute! Elders and superiors go first, by God... By golly, where are your manners? [brooding music] - Hello, Father. - Hello there, daughter. [Betta chuckles] This reminds me of my incestuous days. [cackles] - Oh no, you get to the end of the line. - Why should I? Is sinning a white monopoly as well, hmm? - Get back. - Oh well. He who sins last sins longest. - Friday... It's Friar Savio. Saturday will be yours, Brother. And Sunday will be mine. - And me? - You? - Yeah. - Well, when nobody's there. [friars snicker] - Ah! Ah. [friars chanting in Italian] - Friar Monday, your turn. - Hello, Friar Friday. - I'm Friar Monday, daughter, not Friday. - My god, time is really flying. [friars chanting] - Friar Wednesday, your turn. Hey! Where are you going? Today is Wednesday. - But I thought... When do I? - When nobody else is around. [friars chanting] Today is Sunday! It's our day, my darling. - Oh! Already? [Betta laughs] I'm enjoying every day, but for me Sunday is the best of all. - That's it, go on. Cry your hardest for her. [wistful music] [Salvatore sobs] You! Take of your hat when you pass by the well. There's a saint buried down there. - Guess who's a daddy? - A daddy? - I knew I was going to be a mother, but the father- - Is? That's a stupid question. Are you certain? - Sure. I've been here more than a month. And now that you know, you must try and find a solution. - She's pregnant, fellas. - D'oh! - Uh-huh. - Don't look at me! There's always somebody there! - Well. - Ah, maybe it's wind. - Or indigestion? - We really can't have a baby in the convent, you know. - You're right. They wouldn't understand. The people wouldn't. - No, they certainly wouldn't. - How can we keep it a secret? - Shh. Let me think. I've got an idea. [cows moo] My lord, please help us. - Lord, give us your help. - I beg you, lord, exalt me. - Exalt us all, lord. - I beg you to pardon me. Don't let me down. - Pardon us our sins. - Swing this over the well three times, my son. - But Father, listen. Do you really think Betta will arise from the dead? - Do you question the power of God? - Oh no, Brother, I didn't mean that. I... I was only asking because it would be a miracle. - If the lord has been heeding our prayers, Betta will return to you as she left you. - Do you mean that, Brother? - Yes. - Not maybe a little older? - [Lucci] Only a little, Brother. - Huh. I ain't got nothing to lose. - And now return to your position. Pray. Draw it up. [chain clanking] [suspenseful music] [wondrous music] - Betta! Betta! Betta, I swear to you, as soon as I can find the keys I'll take the belt off. Here, darling, put this around you. Brother, anything I own is yours for the asking. Anything at all. - There is nothing that we need materially. Your happiness is ours. [Salvatore laughs] [solemn music] - Father! - Bless us, Father, bless us. - Bless you. Bless you. - Silence in court! Silence, or I'll have the court cleared. Salvatore Anselme, considering your wife was returned to life by a great miracle, would you explain your motives for bringing this charge of adultery against her? - Because... Because eight months afterwards, Your Excellency, this dirty, lying whore of my wife gave me a son. Negro! [magistrate chuckles] - That's a pity, isn't it? - You've heard all the relevant evidence, Your Honor. It is now the jury's job to decide and evaluate and pass out their verdict. - Would the defense counsel like to add something to that? - Your Honor, the jury, the four cases that we've heard were all grouped together into one hearing for a very specific reason. In each the woman in question is accused of tricking a member of, let's say, the opposite sex in a manner which led in some way to breaking the law. But I would ask all of you to consider these so-called crimes from another point of view: that of the accused. These men who were tricked are in fact responsible for the way these women acted and are all guilty of crimes more serious than the ones committed by the accused, Your Honor. Profanation of God's sacred house, the crimes of adultery, pederasty, and- - I object to that, Your Honor! - Overruled! Defense counsel, continue, please. - And, finally, jealousy of the morbid kind. It produced reactions. Reactions that for these four women are totally natural. Reactions that are essentially characteristic, Your Honor, to their femininity! - I must object again, Your Honor! - Overruled! - Yes, their femininity. That gift that men young and old so appreciate in them. That amazing attribute that men cannot resist, that sends us flying! - Control yourself, Counsel! - Sorry, Your Honor. I guess I did lose control. - Gentlemen of the jury, your decision? - Your Honor, listen. Have a look at them. I think the prisoners would rather rely on your integrity, Your Honor. - In accordance with my position and the power that has been invested in me, and having been made aware of the evidence that is relative to this case, I hereby decree that every one of the prisoners...
