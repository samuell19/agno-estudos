Hey, that's me! Dean. Dropping in on the wave of my dreams! The most perfect thing I've ever seen. Sa-weet! I'm even better than I really am! I could go pro! Wait, my sister? What gives Jan? This is my dream! Look out, goofy foot! Whoa! Focus, focus! No! COUGHING Wiped out. Why can't I just be a great surfer? What am I missing? Why can't I just... Why can't I just... SNORES Why can't you just stop snoring, goofy foot! Ah! Hey, Jan. Are we there yet? Duh. That's why I woke you up. Get my board! I'm not your slave. And don't flick my lobe! COUGHING Look, That must be the way to the beach! "Beach closed. Dangerous undertow. Treacherous riptide. High waves. Stinging jellyfish. No swimming, no surfing, no fun. Get lost." SIGHS Really, Dean? This is where you wanna spend our Summer Vacation? I think I'd rather be stuck at work with Mum. Why didn't you choose to go to Fiji with our cousins? Because Uncle Woody is fun. And it was my turn to pick! Besides, it's gotta be fake. You know Uncle Woody, and the locals put that there to keep the non-surfers out. And where's Uncle Woody, Dean? He was supposed to meet us. Relax Jan. You know what Woody's like. He's probably waiting for us on the other side anyway. See? It's safe. Don't be such a chicken, Janny. I bet you wouldn't be such a chicken if Ritchie O'Donnell was here! SQUAWKING Oh! You're dead meat! SCREAMING See? I told you it was safe. CRASHES Ow! Hey, Check it out. DOOR OPENING Hello? Anybody home? I think it's the maid's decade off. It's creepy. This whole place is creepy. Argh! SCREAMS Keep that ugly thing away from me! Relax, Jan. It's just a tiki souvenir. I found a whole stack of them back there. Put it back, Dean! Sheesh, you need to lighten up, sis. GRUNTS DOOR OPENING PANTING Welcome to Butterfield's Surf City!

MUNCHING Sit on the beach and wax your board in air-conditioned comfort! Learn to speak "surf-cool" with our founder, Francis B Butterfield, the third! "Hit the beach!" "Bo-dacious, dude." "I'm the Big Kahuna!" CRYING Well, Mr. Butterfield, sir, it looks like another record-breaking day... at Surf Cit... I'm bored. Er, excuse me, sir? This is all boring. I'm bored. You're bored and most importantly, Hodad, They're bored. I'm bored, sir? Boring, Hodad. You're boring. How many resorts have I now built, Hodad? Er, with the grand opening of Surf City Kyrgyzstan next month, Sir, I believe that makes forty-three! CHUCKLES And what would one find different about those forty-three parks? Well, we do find we need a higher lifeguard to patron ratio... at Surf City Tibet, Sir. You're not hearing me, Hodad. Do you know who they have minding the playground at Wonderland Beijing? Bears. ROARS SCREAMING Look, this whole Bogus surfer thing is a license to print money, but they are getting bored, Hodad. Market expectations are changing, people want... Bears? What? No! Something different. And you are gonna go find it for me. GASPS I am, sir? Because I don't do well in warm weather climes, I'm very susceptible to heat rash and my allergies. Something different. Somewhere different! GASPS Ever heard of Iki-Iki island, Hodad? Er... Neither have I, Hodad, neither have I. RIBBITS Uncle Woody'll be here. You said that two hours ago. And an hour ago.

CHUCKLES No way! How could I forget my favorite little gromms, man? I just had to er.... What was I saying? Oh, yeah. Dudes, it's just I live on island time. Let's roll out to the ol' surf shack. TIRES SCREECHING Local point of interest, over to the left, you'll see... Uh, I've never seen that before. Okay, over to the right, the local campground. Where people camp, uh, on the ground. GASPS This island is trashed! Who would live in a place like this? HOWLING What was that? Ah, it's just some of the locals, man, they like to burn a bit of rubber now and again. Don't worry about that. CHUCKLE You live in a shack. It's an actual shack. Sa-weet! I've always wanted to live in a cubby! Hey, this ain't ya ordinary shack, little lady. It's totally pimped! I mean its got ummm... tennis courts. Private gymnasium. I don't really have time to get in there as much as I'd like to these days. Oh, and over there the pool moi amigos... GROANS Yeh yah, probably time for its spring clean, dudes. And this, this is the "Pièce de résistance." CHUCKLES That's Spanish for awesome. DOOR OPENING Super sweet! But don't put the boards away! Let's go down and surf the break! Actually I was wondering if you could give me a few pointers. It's been a while. Uh, well, grommets, the beach, is, uh, it's dangerous. Bad surf. Ha! You're nuts! I can see the break from here. Yeah, looks really great! No! Stay off that beach! But the beach is the whole reason we came here. LAUGHING I'm sorry, gromms. Monster, I mean "Mondo" Beach, is bogus. It's a bad break. CHUCKLES Enough with my angry face. There's a great beach on the other side of the island. I'll take you there tomorrow. Who needs grindage? How 'bout some of my classic surfer burritos? Oh! The ones with fresh pineapple and mango salsa? Bring it on! Monster Beach? HOOTING SNORING CHUCKLES SNORES Jan? You awake? GRUNTS What gives, goofy foot? Shhhh! I think Uncle Woody just snuck out. HOOTING This place sucks. I've been bitten by every bug on the island. Why couldn't you have chosen FIJI! Check out the break! Huh? Wow. Why wouldn't he let us surf here? It's the best I've ever seen. Let's find him and ask. HUMMING LICKING GROWLS SCREAMING Hey kid, so nice to meet ya Hey kid you're as white as a sheep You got to look at your face says you never see the place like this LAUGHING Hey, kids Don't go where he said Come here Ain't you the sweetest The moon is bright It's a beautiful night I'll take you down to the sand if you take my hand LAUGHING Never gets old, that one. Monster beach We got some out-of-towners Monster beach Mighty glad you're here It's been a while since we did our welcome speech CHUCKLES Monster beach # Where the living's easy Monster beach Even though it's queezy Monster beach Say you need a place to unwind If you got a lot on your mind It's great therapy You should have seen me before GROWL If you are chasing advice # Come on, go surfing with us And if you come for a dip It's a monster's rip You better know how to swim You don't want to be savedby him LAUGHING Monster beach It's a hidden treasure Monster beach We got lots of leisure Come have some mouth-watering treats Eat! Monster beach Monster beach What he said Welcome to our Monster Pacific Even the plank is monster-ific Please come hang here We're terrific and free Monster beach LAUGHING That was awesome. DOOR OPENS Rommets? You here? RUMBLING Stay back, Surf Monster! You won't eat me! Here, eat my sister. Chillax. Nobody's getting eaten. I don't think. No, no eating. Anyway, we need to talk. GRUNTS This vacation just gets better and better. So, let me get this straight. You own a beach full of monsters who like to surf? You know, "monster" has such a negative connotation. Yeah, cuz they're monsters! They eat people! Fiji doesn't have any monsters! Yeah, look man, I was hoping you'd sorta warm-up to the whole monsters... at the beach thing. It's pretty cool, actually. Really it's more hot. Tropical and all. But hey, you should get to know them! They're good people. Well, they're not really people. Anyone who surfs can't be all bad. Unless they want to eat your brain! CHUCKLES They don't eat brains. Mutt was scared to death of you guys. Folks see monsters and form mobs chase 'em out of town. They're usually not treated very well by, you know, normal dudes. That's okay. We're not normal. And not everyone normal is a dude, man. Look, I wanted a nice, relaxed vacation at a resort that has room service. Like normal people. Is that too much to ask? Okay, okay so none of this is totally normal, right. But normal is boring, man. Monster Beach wasn't always like this. Goin' way back, I came here to Icki-Icki Island chasing my endless summer. But as soon as I saw that break, man, it was the best in the world. The beach belonged to King Aina Haina, The last of a long line of proud rulers of Icki-Icki Island. He was a pretty cool man, man. I taught him how to surf and he taught me how to find my... "subconscious dude." Anyway, The King had a son, Knuttamutta. His subconscious dude, well it was pretty bogus. He wasn't interested in the island ways, man, all he ever thought about was how much... he couldn't wait to be the big kahuna himself. This worried King Aina Haina, so he sent him away to larn the meaning of "responsibility" Did it work? Uncle woody: Nah man, Knutt studied law... sued his father for everything. But he never did give up the island. And when the time came for King Aina to go to that big break in the sky, well, he handed the beach to the only guy left here on the island. Yours truly dude. Years later an enraged Knutt came back. Found the place populated with me and mah surf'n buddies here. He tried to use magic to curse me and take ownership of the island but instead he accidently cursed the beach and everybody on it except me. But how come you weren't cursed too? Because of this. This Idol, it's the tiki deed to the beach. As rightful owner it protects me from Knutt's magic. Where's Knutt now? CHUCKLES You don't have to worry, lil' dude. See, even Knutt himself wasn't immune from the effects of his curse. GRUNTS Self-imposed exile, man. It's a downer. CHATTERING SCREAMING GRUNTS See, now what you've gone and done is spoil the best part and I really do hate it when things get spoilt! COUGH GRUNTS GIBBERISH Little people? Arrived on Monster Beach? I think Woody's brought in reinforcements! If it wasn't already bad enough with that current stock of cursed beach bums... now he's inviting more! I never understood what Daddy saw in that loafer. This Island should be mine. Mine, mine, mine! LAUGHING If I only knew where he hid that idol! Then my magic would work a charm. I could reverse this wretched curse, and rid this island of that Soggy bottomed dunderhead! LAUGHING Shhhhh! Wait a moment. Describe these little people. GIBBERISH Children. They're children! They must be relatives. Oh. Oh! This is too good! Just as all those years ago, Woody tricked my poor Daddy into turning against me, I'm going to trick his family into turning on him! GIBBERISH I shall drive them all off this island and force them to accept me as the rightful King of Icki-Icki island! What's that, poppa? Yes, yes, of course. I plan to make you very proud. LAUGHING Daddy, I want you to be proud of me I'm gonna be the son that you wanted me To be but Daddy I got to do things my own way Let me off the leash To carve my own knees Into the faces of my enemies Cast them to the bottom of the Seven Seas And I will crush them and defeat them I will mash them and let's meet them, you'll see Daddy, understand this is a different time TIRES SCREECHING The problem you faced back then are not like mine Not today but Daddy This whole island has gone apart And before you say that's because I cursed it It's definitely not So let's bury the hatchet Into the helmets of my enemies And I will chop them till they fall like trees Those kids, my key to glory I will use them to restore me I'll speak my children morely I'm a cheat Yes. CLEARS THROAT Finally You'll be proud of me Or I will sink this silent into the sea Now bring me those kids. Okay, beached whales! Monster Beach is now open! Is he like suggesting we get in that like, what do you call it? Like water. IN UNISON Like ew! So, I've kept my word to the Big Kahuna and taken care of Monster Beach. Monsters on a monster break. Sa-weet. Monsters? Oh, yeah, it's, it's monstery but cool. I was kinda hoping you two would learn to love it the way that I do. I'm a looong way from loving any of this. C'mon, gromms, stop watchin' and start carvin'! Surf's up! GRUNTS YELLING COUGHS If I were a better surfer, I'd be liking this more. Hey lil' man, it's cool. My monstery buddies can give you some pointers. LAUGHS Why don't you get outta the sun before you melt? LAUGHING Never mind her man. That's widget! Shaka-nar-nar, brah! Whoa dude! Who are your little buddies? GASPS He's riding backwards! Yeah, that's why he's called Brain Freeze. Oh, and that's Amphibia! Hola, Woody! Nice hat. Uh, that's her hair. Does it always get this crowded? Not if order is Main-Tained! Uh, thanks, Lost Patrol, for taking charge. Good-to-go, commander! LAUGHS Aroow! The Mutt! Whoa, hey, watch it, wave dog! SNIFFING SNARLING GRUNTS CHUCKLES Hey, take a chill pill, Mutt. This is my nephew. I was kinda hoping you'd show the little guy the... "way of the monster style." Monster style? GRUNTS PANTING GRUNTS This place is like something out of an old horror movie. SIGHS Well, at least the bugs aren't so bad. Argh! SCREAMING ROARS CHIRPING GROWLS Widget, I know you're a monster, but why do you live here? Oh! I can't hear you. CHUCKLES Must have water in my ears. SPLASHES DRIPPING Aaaaah! Whoa, I'm losing it! You've got potential, little crusher. But you've got to unleash the inner monster, little Kahuna. Fine. But how am I supposed to do that? It's easy, watch. HOWLING Monster Style! But I can't do that! You only think you can't do that. The answer, therefore, is not to think. SCREAMING I've got night watch. Aloha! Later, LP. What does he "watch" for? Night, I guess. I dig this place, cool break, monster dudes, sunset beach party. You're mental, goofy foot. Monster Beach? Really? This rotting, awful place is just a freakshow! You're such a pain all the time! It's our vacation! We're here! Deal with it! You ruined my whole summer! I'm stuck here because of you! SPLASHES GRUNTS Whoa, gromms, chill! You're scarin' me. And I'm a monster. She okay? Sometimes Jan just doesn't get it. A good joke might cheer her up. What's gray and white and can't surf? Dunno. A parking garage. LAUGHS I thought you said a good joke. Harsh. Look, the vibe here can mess with your head. Give her time. But you, crusher, you get it. With a little training, some of my tutoring, you could really bring it. You mean you can teach me about unlocking my inner surf monster? He totally can! Brain Freeze taught me to be fierce with that water! To go Monster style! GROWLS LAUGHING GROWL SCREAMING Who was that? GASPS Tourists. LAUGH PANTING I can't understand a thing you're saying. Stop babbling, Hodad! You're not coming home until you tell me about that island. But, sir, you don't want this island. Why? Well, sir, if you could see this place for yourself. SCREAMS I have and I love it! You, you do? Wait, how did you get here? My luxury yacht. CHATERRING HORN HONKING I asked you to find me something different, Hodad. Something unique. This is a beach populated with real living surfing monsters. It's perfect! Twilight fall Night bird caw Sing your song of mystery Soon you secret will be... known to everybody And the whole moon flock will come to see Bag that up for me, would you, Hodad? GRUNTS It's an island with the smile and groove of ghouls greeting guests in the gate But they won't be eating brains, they'll be trained Wait a minute, they'll behave A mysterious invention into mystey Do it with professional consistency And I wouldn't need to change a thing at all See, it's a mighty nice slice of paradise but it ain't weather-proof It will be even more prestine with a little lick of paint and a roof There ain't no problem that a little bit of mini golf And a tiny unbrella in a drink can't solve And I wouldn't need to change a thing at all What could be better than a Monster Beach A Monster Beach themed Monster Beach I put the creatures in the people's beach Folks can only dream But I have seen it I just have to theme it So get every bit of frills and fun in me Once we got all that money We will scare them away And I wouldn't need to change a thing I wouldn't rearrange a thing And I wouldn't need to change a thing at all LAUGHING You ain't changing at all # Except for that. Tomorrow Hodad, we find out who owns this island... and we buy it! That's it, Grommit! You're improving. GROANS So, what's the secret to Monster Style? The secret is nothing. Nothing? Yeah, I mean you gotta totally let go to let it out. Stop holding back and out comes the inner monster. So practice doing nothing. Do nothing. Woah, woah, woah! COUGHING That wasn't nothing, crusher. That was "wiping out." CHUCKLES It's hard being a monster. Uh, tell me about it. I can't even see through my hair most of the time. ELECTRICAL CRACKLE Uh, hello? Excuse me? We were wondering if you have any rooms available? STOMPING Oh, ah... a roo, how did you get in there? Game, Teddles want to play game. I'm loosing patience, Hodad.

I go again, I spy... something starting with "T". Trailer. Teddles get nother turn. FLIES BUZZING So, as you can see despite being cursed everyone has sort of adjusted to life here. They're safe in the sun. Which is more than I can say for the food. GASPS What is that? SPLUTTER Ahhh... "Hey Madgey? What flavour is this"! Wha, I dunno let me see. Chicken and Fish balls with gravy circa 199... What? You don't like it? Mummy's boy, fix da Mutt something else, wouldya honey? He don like his breakfast. GROWLS STOMPING Pro tip, Gromms.

Er, no, nothing, just mild scoliosis likely... due to fanning you last night as you slept, sir. The air con was out, Hodad. Yes sir... Argh! Er, excuse me, madam, it appears someone has misplaced their eyeball in my tea. THUDDING DOOR CLOSING You okay, Jan? As okay as I can be. I get why goofy foot likes this place. But maybe it's not for me. Jan-O, do you remember when you were little? You were more of a monster than your bro. I was? Totally. You were a handful. But you were fun and "in the moment." You need more of that in your life. Besides, these monsters are people, too. Or they used to be. And you used to be a monster. You know what I'm trying to say? No. Bummer. I was hopin' you could tell me. I think you're saying to just chill... and give these "people" a chance. Wow. I'm really deep sometimes. I thought this place would be... a sun-soaked wonderland Teenagers frolick to the sounds of a surfing land But as soon as I arrived I started fearing for my life This holiday's a nightmare that won't end CRYING I think they build this place out of all of my bad dreams You put your ear to a shell and you just hear horrible screams SCREAMING And the cook should get the sack Even the seagulls send food back I hate this place I hate this place I hate this place GASP That guy's molding # And that guy's starting to smell She really hates it She really hates it GRUNTS She's revolting and he just looks unwell She really hates it She really, really hates it She's half girl half trout I guess I'm the odd one out I hate this place I can't believe it I hate this place I hate this place How could you hate a place like this It's easy The friendliness And queezy Whatever you be questioning Just leave me be Just leave her be When the moon comes out at night SOBBING You know it's not gonna be alright HOWLING I hate this place!

True King of Icki-Icki Is... Awww. King? Gragh! Fantastic. Just fantastic. Isn't that special, Hodad? CLAPPING Really special, sir. My head of entertainment can never manage to put together a tropical show this amusing. And I love your workspace. Always intimidate others with your presentation, I say. That is the idea. See now, King Knutt, you may just be the man I've been looking for... You know that derelict, monster infested mud flat down there... well ah, I was thinking of making you an offer for it. We have a guest. Refreshments! You mean the place they call Monster, Beach? Beach. Sure, whatever you whimsical natives call it. See being a "King", would it be correct to assume that this particular beach belongs to you and that, should that indeed be the case, you, as the proprietor could indeed sell it to me? Why, yes. I can sell you that beach. But what is in the deal for me? Well, the money and... I'll uh, make you the official chief of Surf City! Hold on. Did you say you'd officially make me the "Chief" of a... GASPS city? And I was going to settle for being king of a deadbeat island. Not just any city. Surf city! You just have to sign this contract bestowing a few things to me, approving some permits, it's all very technical boring stuff and of course, er, protecting your interests. You surely, don't think I'm that stupid. I'll get my legal team give this the once-over. HUMMING MUNCHING That's it, sign away all your rights. Very well... Now, we dance! Big Chief! Big Chief Finally I'm the Big Chief Excellent, now as you would've noted in section 235A... I'm going to need some form of formal deed to seal the deal. You er, will provide that, I am sure... Excuse me, the deed? You do have the deed? Uh, yes, yes, yes, yes of course. I have it in a very secret place. CHUCKLING Might just take me a couple of days to "retrieve it". I like secrets. So long as only I know them. FINGER SNAPS Hodad! I'll give you 7 days, Knutt. I'll be back then to collect my deed or the deal is off. SIGHS Daddy always said.

We are right on schedule for phase 2, sir. You really should come down here and see it for yourself... SCREAMS I have... Yes, sir! Well, I think this calls for a little celebration. Look, I even got your favourite little umbrella! Celebrate? GLASS BREAKING Just make sure everything is ready for the big day tomorrow, Hodad. It's time to turn Monster Beach into Monster Beach TM! You trademarked the beach, sir? Of course I did. Now. Lets go pick up my deed. CHUCKLING I'm so glad we came here, Uncle Woody. Best-vacation-ever. Alright, my fellow Compadres, surfers, monsters and uh... SCOFFS Whatever it is you're classified as Boogie. I like to say something. It has been most "privalegous"... to have been the caretaker of Monster Beach... since the passing of my buddy, the great king aina haina. But as you some of you may or may not know, something happened to me some months back. Something really deep and profound man... But I forgot what it was... Oh, yeah! My parakeet died, man! I loved that parakeet! One day he just dropped straight off his perch for no reason. Or maybe there was that little dude used to party pretty hard... but the point was man, "what would happen... if without warning, I fell off my "metaphorical perch", man? I'm glad you like it here, Jan Because, well, my plan is to give you kids Monster Beach. Give us the beach? That's right. This place is special and it needs a guardian. Someone to act on behalf of the these guys with the rest of the world. But, Uncle Woody, you're not leaving, are you? Nah. I don't think so. Uh, nope. Not for a long time, I hope. But it's time for me to let a new generation take care of this place. SIGHS Nah, forget it, dudes. I'm happy to announce that my little gromms... Jan and Dean are now official members... of the Monster Beach Beach Club! SNORE CHUCKLING GASPS Goofy foot. BLAAGH MURMURING Yes. I will bring the deed to King Knut.

SNARLING Chill, guys, he can't do anything. Look, I own this beach and I have the deed to prove it. CHUCKLING Oh! You mean, this deed? The deed sold to me by the king of Iki-Iki island? But Janny, how did he...? I, I, thought I was dreaming. There was a man, with a flaming head. He tricked me! Knutt! Knutt: It's true. The girl speaks the truth... What? It was him! He put a spell on me and made me give him the deed, Uncle Woody. I'm sorry. What? Yes, look, it is possible that I did do that. But it's hardly my fault, being practically orphaned. I never learned right from wrong... Society is to blame really when you think about it. You went to Oxford, dude! And didn't that just mess me up! SOBBING Wait a second. Is any of this even legal? I have all the notarized paperwork. Monster Beach TM now belongs entirely to me! Oh, on that topic. You all thus collectively owe me... $235,000 and 40 cents. In backpayed rent. GASP We don't have that kinda money, man! Technically, I don't even have a job. Ah ha! You do now, big guy. Just make sure he does something about that hair. Hope you have a permit for that. GLASS BREAKING Ew! Embalming. Call an embalmer. RETCHES Get him wormed, de-flead, and Rabies shots. Actually, Rabies shots for everyone. Anyway's, looking forward to working with you all. The kids are just gonna love ya! He can't really do this, can he, Uncle Woody? Can he? SIREN WHOOPS AND BLARES SIREN WHOOPS I never would have thought my last night on Monster Beach... would be like this. No way! I can't believe there's nothing we can do. Well, troops, it looks like tonight will be our... last patrol. What is wrong with all of you? I can't believe, I'm hearing this! Look, I hated this place at first, but I can't imagine just giving up! Just throwing in the beach towel! We have to fight them! We can't just go to pieces! Totally with you, but what do we do? I say the Deed was stolen from us, so we issue an order to steal it back! Uh, Lost Patrol, I don't think... No, no. LP is right. He is? We have to fight. Listen up, surf-rats, we could fight them with legal battles and court actions, but that might take hundreds of years and cost millions of dollars. No, we have to do something... Totally monster style! Right. A monster plan so raggin', so bodacious, so aggro they'll never see it coming! Sounds like we'll need some crazy magic to pull it off. Oh, we will. And I know someone who can help with that. GROANS GRUNTING SCREAMS LAUGHING Aye! GROANS SCREAMS WHISTLES GLASS BREAKING MOANING Poppa, it's time to make some magic! Lights!

That's the plan. Or at least, I'm pretty sure that's the plan? Be careful. Oh, and please don't tell your mum I let you do this. STRUGGLING This surf's totally huge. Can, can we do this? Just remember what Brain Freeze taught you! You'll be fine! Surf's up! GASPING SNORES Shhh. Wait right there! There is a half a percent missing from this quarterly earning statement!

I am not letting this thing out of my sight again. Well, that's about it. That's the end of the story. Oooh. This is really quite fun. Oh, and if you ever wondered what happened to Butterfield, turns out he didn't have a building permit. Apparently the Judge was really tough. IN UNISON Guilty, guilty, guilty. Last I heard Butterfield was living in a trailer park somewhere. I spy something start with "T". GROANS As for me, I found the wave of my dreams on a beach full of monsters. How sa-weet is that?
