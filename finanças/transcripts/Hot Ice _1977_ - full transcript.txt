(upbeat music) - Oh, the eternal city. I always wanted to see Rome. Art, wine, romance, exciting nights. - Hold it, business is business, fun time comes later. Good thing I have enough of these stock certificates left. - You are a bit of a rogue, darling but one hell of a security salesman. - Who am I to turn down a greedy looking for a fast buck. - Why, darling, you'd be out of your mind. - Certainly, if suckers wanna part with a couple of grand, I'm willing to accommodate them. - Speaking of accommodations, we've got a plane to catch, Rome, remember? (man knocks) - Ah, that must be the bellman for the luggage. Oh, come in, please! - Inspector Giroux of INTERPOL. (climactic music) You are under arrest for selling worthless stock certificates. Madame, would you please get your coat? - Do what he says, darling. - You two have given me quite a chase. I have been tracking you all over Europe. Ah, I see you're getting ready to leave again, Mr. And Mrs. Farthington III. You were not satisfied to take the man's money, oh no, you had to take his name too, Mr. Farthington III. - For our lifestyle and specter, it fits so well, don't you agree? - Ah, allow me, madame. (climactic music) - Now what? - Let's get out of here fast and I don't mean Rome, home. (Mr. Giroux knocks on closet door) (plane drones) (exciting music) (people chatter) (upbeat music) - Oh, this coffee's so good, makes me feel warm all over. - Feels good. (people chatter) - The snow is just really great. - I know, I almost took a bad spill on seven this morning. - Oh, but I see you saved yourself? - Yeah. - Yeah, (indistinct) (woman laughs) (people chatter) (upbeat music) - It's really nice to be back here at the Mattahorn Ski Lodge. - Yes, darling, it really is nice. (man laughs) (people chatter) (upbeat music) - Got some fine-looking chicks up here. - Yeah, Mattahorn Ski Club, always got good-looking broads around the day after the race. (people chatter) (upbeat music) - Hello, Allen. Victor, you should be ashamed of yourself. - Well, I, you know you're the only one in my life, sweetheart. - Oh, sweetheart mm. - If there were more married couples like you, this world wouldn't be so screwed up. (Victor and Danielle laugh) - Thank you, Allen. - Vic, I almost forgot, could you put this in the house safe. Being Diamond Jim's manager, I always have to take care of his valuables. - Valuable stuff, hey? - Valuable, quarter of a million in ice. And I don't mean the kind that melts. - Oh. - You've got nothing to worry about, Allen, we haven't lost so much as a postage stamp out of that safe. - Ah. - You mean this is real? - Yeah. - I thought most movie stars wore fake diamonds as a rule. - Nah, not Diamond Jim, he wears the real thing. It's a thing with him. - There, locked up and (indistinct). - Ah, any chance of a girl trying some on for size? (Allen and Danielle laugh) - I don't think the insurance company would like that. - Oh, well, better luck next time. - See you later. - Okay. Bye, Allen. - Take it easy, Allen. - Take care. A quarter of a million dollars. I oughta trade you in for a guitar player. I didn't know they were so rich. - Speaking about rich, darling, get a load at what's coming in. Those must be the Farthington's. - Mm. - Mr. And Mrs. Farthington. - Yeah, that's right. - We've been expecting you sir. - Very good. - Would you like to sign the register, Mr. Farthington. - Certainly. - Fine. My wife, Danielle. - Hello. - Charmed. - Mrs. Farthington. - How do you do? - How do you do, ma'am? Please to meet you. - I see the famous Diamond Jim is appearing here. We've been in Europe for so long, we haven't had a chance to catch any of his performances. We're really excited about seeing him. - Diamond Jim opens tomorrow night. You'll love the show. Great, great show. - Yes, and he wears a quarter of a million dollars wroth of real diamonds. He's not phony like some of the others. - You don't say. - Oh, yes, and we keep them right here in our safe. - Uh, uh, suite 171, Charlotte, 171. We're just very flattered to have you here, sir. - Well, I'm sure we'll enjoy our stay. It was nice meeting both of you, good day. - Bye-bye. That's what I call rich, real class. I can tell it a mile away. - Well, I'm off, darling. - Where are you going? - To my ski lesson with my instructor, Erik. He says my form is improving. (Victor chuckles) Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. (upbeat music) (smooth romantic music) (Erik and Danielle moan) - You know your form's really improving. (Danielle laughs) - Thanks for the compliment. You know, as a ski instructor, Erik, you're good. But as a lover, you're great. Oh, but I have to go. (Danielle moans) (smooth romantic music) Come on, Erik, I can't make love to you all the time. Besides, there are plenty of other girls around here. Don't worry, see you tomorrow at the usual time? - Oh, it feels so good to be home, doesn't it, darling? - Yes, dear. - You know, I was really terrified. - Forget it, we got away, didn't we? Nobody knows we're here. We're safe. - Darling, speaking of safe, what do you think about the diamonds in the safe below us? You know what it just gives me the shivers to think about all that loot stashed down there. - Hey, forget it, we're con artists, not safe crackers. Besides, don't forget we came here to cool off for awhile. Now you be a good girl and relax. - Well, I was just thinking, that's all. After all you can't blame me for trying. Diamonds are a girl's best friend. (smooth jazz music) (pleasant music) - What a set of g'shorks on this thing. - Victor, darling, what's the matter? Are you all right, are you sick? - I'm okay, sweetheart, it's just been one of those days, one of those hectic days, it's like a three ring circus down there. And that crazy rock group and this nut, Diamond Jim. Oh, wait till you meet this guy. Do this, do that, get me this, get me that. He talks to me like I'm one of his personal whatever you call it. I just told Charlie to take over, I've had it up to here. I've had it, had it. I'm sorry, sweetheart. How was your day? - Same as yours. Hectic, oh that village makes me so mad. They didn't have anything I wanted. The whole trip leaves me totally exhausted. And I'm freezing to death. (Victor moans and laughs) - Victor, what are you doing? - I'm warming your feet, sweetheart. (Danielle laughs) - Oh, stop. (dramatic music) Oh, that feels good. Victor. Victor, darling, I thought you weren't feeling very well. (Victor laughs) - I'm feeling a little better now. You wanna play don't you? (Danielle laughs) I can tell when you wanna play. I can feel it. I know that feeling, I know that look. (Danielle laughs and moans) (Victor laughs) - You just wanna play a little. Play hard to get. - Darling, I think I- - I know you want to, I can feel it. (Danielle laughs) - All right, Victor, I better get myself together. (indistinct) darling. (Danielle laughs) - Sweetheart, I thought we were. (quirky music) A little shot of Konyak might warm you up, sweetheart. - [Danielle] That sounds like a good idea, darling. - I thought it would. ♪ Victor's gonna get it tonight tonight ♪ ♪ Victor's gonna get it tonight tonight ♪ (upbeat band music) Ready, sweetheart! Sip of Konyak (indistinct). (upbeat band music) (Victor mumbles) - [Danielle] Is everything all right, Victor? - Anytime you're ready, baby. (slow romantic music) (Victor hums) Swirl it around a little sweetheart, it'll warm the conkles of your heart. Ah. - Mm. - Do you feel better now? - Well, I'm still just a little cold. - A little what? - A little cold. - A little cold. Hmm-mm, I have just the thing for that. Gonna warm you up. (head thumps) (Spanish music) (Victor sings in foreign language) (upbeat band music) - Oh, Victor, are you all right, darling? Be careful, darling. - Gonna do a little crash dive now. (speaks in foreign language) (Victor crashes) (dramatic music) (Danielle laughs) - Oh, Victor, now look what you've done. (dramatic music) Calm down and go to sleep, all right?

I mean, we don't know her, right? - What she can do, I can do better. - I don't know. Ah, okay. (man laughs) (upbeat music) (people laugh) Oh, my gosh, hey, you guys, it's getting late. Don't you think we oughta get back to the lodge? - No, we can't forget those two though. - Well, I can forget them.

You're gonna be all right, we'll take care of you. - Oh, thank you. - Come on, come on. - Thank you for rescuing me. I was so frightened, so afraid. - We couldn't let a pretty girl like you lay out here and freeze to death, could we? - Oh, oh, oh, I thought I would freeze to death.

You know it, I'm a con man not a safe cracker. - Well, if we're going to pull it off, we have to come up with something. - I'm thinking, I'm thinking. The question is what's the first step? - Well, that's easy, the first step, get the combination. - Oh funny, funny girl. Clancy, Clancy with his electrical gadgets. He'd be perfect. - Darling, I knew you'd come up with something. But isn't it too late to get him? - Clancy never sleeps. Besides I know where to get him day or night. Switchboard's closed this time of night, so I'll be able to get a direct line out without being overheard. - Good. - Operator, yes, area code 213 390-5855, thank you. (dramatic music) Clancy, hey you old son of a gun. Yeah, it's me. Well, we've been out of the states for awhile. Listen, pal I need a favor and it's right up your alley. There's a safe that needs your expert touch. That's right, I need the combination. You got anything in your bag of tricks that can give me the numbers? (man laughs) That's great. Two grand is fine. All right, listen, I'm staying at the Matterhorn Ski Lodge in Fallbrook. Right, right, okay, Clance, okay, all right, thanks, Clancy, goodbye. (man laughs) I don't believe it. It's a device that we put into the safe, when the tumblers are turned, it records the numbers. - Oh, fantastic, oh. (man laughs) (upbeat music) - Yes, Mr. Bradford, yes, sir, don't worry about a thing. Your reservations are confirmed for a late arrival. I understand, sir, don't worry, take care of everything. I've got everybody on the staff working on it, Mr. Bradford, don't you worry, I promise you, everything will be just the way it's always been. Don't worry. Oh, Mr. Farthington, one moment please. Yes, sir, we know you'll be coming by car. We know you'll be a little late. Yes, sir, yep. Don't worry about a thing sir. Last minute arrivals, J.P. Bradford, multi-million dollar oil man. Everything at a moment's notice with this guy. - Ah, there was something you wanted, Mr. Flemming? I'm in a bit of a hurry. - Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Farthington, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. This just arrived by special messenger. It's addressed to Mrs. Farthington. - Mrs. Farthington. This would have ruined the whole surprise if she would have gotten it. For our anniversary. - Wow. Hey, (man laughs and whistles) that is some gift. Congratulations, sir. - Thank you. You know how women are, sort of curious and that sort of thing. I don't want Mrs. Farthington to find this until the anniversary. But I don't know where to hide it. - Hide it, it will be perfectly safe in there sir. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. You see that wire, it's an extra precaution. It's hooked up to an alarm system which goes off in my suite upstairs. If anybody tries to tamper with this safe, one side security. You've got nothing to worry about. - Okay, if you say so. - And once again, sir, let me congratulate you on your anniversary. - Thank you. Not a word about our little secret to Mrs. Farthington. And remember, this is gonna be a surprise. - Oh, my lips are sealed. (dramatic music) - Hi, Mr. Flemming, can I have my present please? - Sure, Mr. Farthington. Here you are. - Thank you very much. - Mr. Farthington, let me say one thing, it's a pleasure having people like you and your wife staying at the hotel. - I'll tell my wife that. I think she'll appreciate it very much. (people laugh) - Oh wait. - Ah-ha. - Look, 36-32-36. - (man laughs) Clancy came through again. - Now what? - Now we wait till we put the diamonds in the safe and then we take them. - But aren't you forgetting about the alarm system, the wire that goes down through the safe that goes bang bang in the manager's ear? - No, no, I have a plan.

We'll have somebody down there in a minute. Don't you worry, sir. - Hurry up, Flemming, I'm freezing out here. - Yes, sir, we'll have somebody down there right away.

Hop in the station wagon and go pick him up. - [Charlie] I can't do it, Mr. Flemming. - [Victor] What do you mean, you can't do it, Charlie? - [Charlie] I can't drive with this thing. - You know, you young guys are all the same. I mean it, you come here for one reason and one reason only, bumming around boos and broads. Nevermind, I'll pick him up myself, moron. (phone rings) - Hello? Victor, darling. - Hello, sweetheart. - Yeah, listen, I've got a stranded guest, broken down in a car and that creep Charlie's got a broken leg, I'd like to break his head. - Charlie broke his leg, what again? - I won't be long, I'll just be a little while. Yeah, I love you babe. - All right, darling, drive carefully. - Charlie. - Yes, Mr. Flemming? - I want you to listen to what I have to say. What are you doing, I can get it on, just listen to what I have to say. - Yes, sir. - Now, you turn off the lights, you close the switchboard, and you turn out the nightlights. Why are you shaking your head, Charlie, can you hear me? - Oh, yes, sir, yes, sir. - And you close up in about a half and hour and do me one favor, Charlie, just one favor. Come in tomorrow morning on time, a change of pace or something, huh? And don't go down to Kelly's and get yourself all zapped out. - Yes, sir, Mr. Flemming. Yes sir. (dramatic music) Remember to turn the lights off, close the switchboard, be on time in the morning, lock up in half an hour. The hell I will, I'll lock up right now. Kelly, here I come. (dramatic music) (man and woman laugh) (romantic music) - Erik, really? - Let's go out for a nightcap. You're so warm, so soft. - I know. (woman and man moan) - Think of my condition. - What condition? - You know. - I know your condition, come on, do it or forget it. This condition of yours if gonna blow my whole caper. - There's always tomorrow. - Erik, you're a great lover. Wrong. (upbeat music) - Oh, why Mrs. Flemming, I must have the wrong suite, no wonder the key wouldn't work. - Why, Mr. Farthington, this is really a surprise. I thought it was my husband. - My wife and I had a little fight. Every anniversary it's the same thing, fight, fight, she practically threw me out of the room. I took a little walk and. - You poor thing. What an awful thing to happen to a nice man like you. Come in, this is no time for you to be alone. (dramatic music) I was just about to fix myself a drink, won't you join me? - Well, that sounds like a good idea, Mrs. Flemming, I could use one. - Is Scotch all right? - On the rocks, it's fine. - You know, Victor and I often have our little problems ourselves and we just have to let these things work themselves out. I always say time heals all. Here. - Thank you. - Well, just put it out of your mind. Cheers. - Cheers. (dramatic music) - I always feel that when two people are having a friendly drink, they should become more familiar. Please, call me Danielle. - Danielle, that's such a lovely name to go with such a beautiful face. (Danielle chuckles) You have such a kind, warm heart. Call me Win. - Win. Oh, Win, please excuse me, I really wasn't expecting company. - Oh, of course. - I'll just be am moment. (Danielle laughs) (dramatic music) - Come on Winford, you dummy, go, one wire's he's gotta cut. (dramatic music) Please. Oh, god, no. Okay, calm down, just.

(dramatic music) (climactic music) - That's it, oh yes. (dramatic music) Oh, I can't believe it, we did it, we did it! Oh, god so beautiful. (woman moans and man moans) (car engine revs) (dramatic music) - What kind of a joker would send me out on a night like this on a wild goose chase? (dramatic music) - Yes, this gets me out of all kinds of work. Like tonight, I got out of picking up some old goat stuck in the cold outside. (man laughs) Mr. Flemming had to go. And I went straight to Kelly's and had a few. (men laugh) - Hey, did Mrs. Flemming go? - No, she's in her room. - Thanks. - Hey, Erik, look, be a pal and don't tell anybody about this. No, really, I mean, if they find out then I'll really have to start working. (Erik laughs) Work, it's the curse of the drinking class. - Don't worry, guy, your secret's mine, okay? - Thanks, pal. - Right. - Take care. - Yeah. (dramatic music) (man knocks) - Your husband? - I don't know. - Well, what are we gonna do? - The closet. (dramatic music) (Erik knocks) Who is it? - Your Nordic god's here. Hi. (Danielle chuckles) I heard your husband's out. That should give us a little time for love. - Erik, (Danielle laughs) I didn't expect you. What a surprise. Actually this isn't a good time. You see, I was just about to lie down and get a little- - Exactly, hey, that's what I had in mind. (Erik laughs) - No, that's not what I had in mind, Erik, stop, Erik. Erik, please stop. Erik, I mean it, Erik if you don't stop now, if you ever wanna see me again, Erik. Erik, listen, it's too late, we don't have time, it's too late. - Hey, honey, it's never too late. (door rattles) It's too late. The closet. - No. Under the bed. Erik, don't argue with me, get under the bed. (dramatic music) Darling, you look exhausted. - Exhausted, huh, you wanna know what happened out there? I'll tell you what happened out there. Some son of a bitch pulled a prank on me. There's no broken car out there. - Oh, you poor thing. Ooh, and you're cold. Darling, why don't I fix you a nice drink. - Why don't you make it a double. Make it a triple. I can't figure out who would do something like this. Maybe it's those creeps from the Matterhorn Ski Club. - Oh, they're always doing things like that. - Yeah, well, I'll tell you something, it was about 30 degrees below zero and I wasn't too happy about it. - Here, this will make you feel much better. - Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, you ready for this, after that creep lays that break down crap on me, you ready for this, I had a flat tire. - Oh, you poor darling. I have an idea. - What's your idea? - Why don't you take a nice, hot bath. - Nah, uh-uh, I'm not ready for a bath tonight. - Oh, yes, you listen to me, I don't want a sick husband on my hands. - All right, all right. - Come on, you'll feel much better. - Okay, okay. - Come on, darling, you'll feel relaxed and ready for bed. - Okay. Maybe later I'll get a little something to warm me up. (Danielle laughs) - Aren't you cute. - The more I think about this the angrier I get. If I ever catch the moron that pulled this on me, he's gonna be sorry, I tell you right now, sorry. (dramatic music) Sweetheart, I'm just not up to a bath tonight, noway. Oh. Hey, come here, come here, love. (Danielle laughs) Come here. This has been one heck of a day. (Danielle laughs) - You can say that again. (woman and man moan) Whoa, whoa, let me get my pants off. I'll be right back. - I'll make up the bed. - Good idea. - Erik, Erik, come out. - [Erik] I can't. - What do you mean you can't? - I am stuck. - Oh, Erik this is no time for jokes. (Danielle grunts) Hurry. The window, the window, don't ask any questions, just hurry. - Please. - Go, go. (wind howls) - I thought you were gonna make the bed? - I was just about to do that sweetheart. - I'll help. - Oh, I think that's wonderful. (Victor chuckles) (upbeat music) - Come in, come in and warm me. Oh, finally, finally. (man and woman moan) (quirky music) (loud rattling) Did you just hear the front door close? - Doors close, no, you must be hearing things. - Well, maybe I'm hearing things but I know one thing for sure, I'm feeling things. (man and woman moan) (quirky music) Oh Danielle. (Danielle laughs) (man and woman moan) Are you cold? Don't you feel a little cold, it's not cold in here? (wind howls) (man laughs) No wonder it's cold, the patio doors are open. Don't you go away. 'Cause I'm gonna come and get you. Let's go back to play, here comes your flying tiger. (dramatic music) (Danielle laughs) (Victor chuckles) - Victor, not again. (quirky music) (man knocks) (dramatic music) - Oh no. (wind howls) (man shivers) - Ta-da! - Ah, ah! (upbeat music) To be perfectly frank with you, my dear, I didn't think we could pull this off. - Oh, you've gotta be kidding, the genius that you're married to. Oh, fantastic. They're so lovely, darling, oh, I'm so happy, I knew you could do it, I knew you could do it, darling. Here, I want you to have them. I want you to see them, I want you to feel them, I want you to try them on. Aren't they fantastic? Do you love them? - I love you. - Do you love me? Look at this, look at this. Wait, wait, wait, there's more. - More, there's more. - Wait, one minute. - Oh, there's more. - There's more. - There's more. Ta-da. - What? - Let's see, what have we here. - What? - Oh goodness, this looks like a little bag of tricks. We have right there and we have, oh gully, (indistinct). - What? - Darling, now wait a minute, just wait a minute. We've got. - You're kidding. - No! (woman and man holler) Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Oh. (woman laughs) Oh, no. - Wait there's more. - Honey. - Look at this. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, oh you're not so cold now huh, huh, huh? Look at this, look at this, look at the ring! (woman hollers and laughs) (man laughs) Oh, I love you, I love you. - Oh, look, look, oh yes. - I can't believe it. - This is a yacht, this is a trip too. - This one, this is my mink, this is the fur I always wanted. - Oh. - Do you love it? - Here's a penthouse in New York. (woman laughs) Room service forever. - Oh, darling, you look a little weird in this, it looks much better on me. What do you think? - I think you'd look better on me. (woman hollers) Wait, wait a minute. Ooh, ah, these diamonds feel so good. - Uh-huh. - Why don't we just take them right now and get out of here tonight? - Oh, no, noway. No, once they find that these diamonds are missing, everyone in this lodge comes under suspicion. If we're gone, it'll put the finger right on us. The cops start checking, they might find out who we really are. No, no, I think we shall make our graceful exit the night before the snow mobile race. Everyone will be there and we won't be missed. - Darling, I have another little surprise for you. Nothing too fantastic just. - What? - Just a little. I found them in the safe when I went in there. (woman laughs) Do you believe it? - By the way, what did you do with the attache case? - Oh, I threw it out the window. I mean, they're never gonna find it until the snow melts and that'll be months from now. (man and woman laugh) - Ooh, I love to see the look on his face when he finds the diamonds missing. (man laughs) - Ah, I did the caper of the year. - They're gone. The diamonds are gone. - My diamonds, we've been ripped off. - But I don't understand how, I- - How is right! You and your fool-proof safe. Well, just don't stand there man, get on the horn! Get the fuzz, call the FBI, cable the CIA. Get the fire department, for god's sakes do something. - Hey, you don't panic in a situation like this, you don't panic, Allen. - Don't panic, he said. - Whoever took these diamonds cannot be far away. Now just give me some time to think, Allen, I'm gonna get them back for you, I promise. - What the hell am I gonna tell that temperamental star of mine? He's going to fall apart. The insurance company, oh god, the insurance company, what will I tell them? - You tell them absolutely nothing, Allen. If this publicity gets out, it could be bad for Diamond Jim. Not to mention the lodge. - What do I care about the lodge! - Hey, hey, hey, just cool it and don't do anything stupid, Allen. The publicity could be bad for you. Negligence on your part. - Huh? - Huh, I've been through this thing a couple of times before, Allen, I know the score, let me handle everything. Why don't you go to your room, get a little rest. - Yes, yes, my room. Rest awhile. - I'll call you if anything comes up, Allen, just take it easy. - Oh, why me, why me? I've always been a good man, a good husband, a good manager, why me? - Anything wrong, Mr. Flemming? - Oh, no, what could be wrong, Mr. Farthington? - Seems to me when you have the wrong end of a ballpoint pen in your mouth, that something must be bothering you. - Oh, well. (man laughs) (quirky music) (pleasant music) I want the truth, Charlie, where did you go after you closed up last night? - Look, Mr. Flemming, I already told you once, I went to my room, now where else could I go with my leg in a cast? - Charlie. - Okay, okay, I might as well tell you. - Tell me what? Uh-huh? - I stopped at Kelly's last night but just for a short time, I only had one drink, I swear. - Charlie, I'm not interested, I'm not interested in Kelly's, I wanna know did you hear, did you see anything suspicious while you working? - Not only no, Mr. Flemming but hell no. - Okay, relax, no offense, Charlie. I'm just trying to get at the facts. I mean, the reputation, my reputation, the reputation of the lodge is at stake. - Everybody's under suspicion until those diamonds are found. - Allen, please, let me handle this. Why don't you just go to your room, hmm? - Hello, Allen. What's the matter, Sweetheart, you look 1,000 miles away? - I got a catastrophe on my hands, that's what's wrong. Somebody broke into the safe last night and stole all the diamonds. I checked the apartment, the wires to the alarm system were cut. I can't figure out how they got cut and unless somebody came in while I was on that wild goose chase. Did anybody come in or what? - No, no, absolutely not, I never left the place. - They can't cut themselves. - Wait a minute. - What? - Remember how you found our balcony doors open last night? - The window, the window. You're, wait a minute, if you didn't leave the room, how- - I never said that sweetheart, I said I never left the place. I went to the bathroom to get a bath. - Bath, which would give somebody plenty of time to get in, cut the wires and then get out. And that accounts for that phony phone call I got to get me out of the lodge. - Well that solves that. - Yeah, that solves that all right, now all we have to do is find out who, when, how, why and where. ♪ Call me anytime you think that you need me ♪ ♪ Call me anytime ♪ ♪ Call me anytime you think that you need me ♪ ♪ Day or night ♪ ♪ Call me when you need to cry and don't know why ♪ ♪ Call me when you're higher than a crowbird's eyes ♪ ♪ Call me when you're stuck in the middle can't get by ♪ ♪ Call me anytime you think that you need me ♪ ♪ Call me anytime ♪ ♪ Call me anytime you think that you need me ♪ ♪ Day or night ♪ ♪ Call me anytime you think that you need me ♪ ♪ Call me anytime ♪ ♪ Call me anytime you think that you need me ♪ ♪ Day or night ♪ ♪ You can call me when you need to cry and don't know why ♪ ♪ Call me when you're higher than a crowbird's eyes ♪ ♪ Yeah call me when you're stuck in the middle ♪ ♪ And can't get by ♪ (audience claps and cheers) Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to apologize for Diamond Jim's not being here tonight, he's got laryngitis, so let's hope he gets better, thank you. (audience claps) (dramatic music) - I can't believe it, a quarter of a million dollars in my arms. - Don't breathe too easy, we're not out of the woods yet. We've got a long ways to go to the main highway. - Oh, and then out of this snowy mess. Ooh, let's get some heat in here. (dramatic music) - Heat. Please don't mention that word. - Ah, I feel so much better. (dramatic music) (engine revs) - Oh, hell of a time to get stuck. - Well, what are we gonna do now just sit here and freeze? Come on, what are we gonna do? - Come on, what are we gonna do? We're gonna wait here, we've got plenty of gas, the heater's working. Look, we'll just wait till daylight. - Oh, fine. (wind howls) (wolf howls) (slow music) - We must have had a blizzard while we were sleeping. - Oh, I guess we have. Well, we either die here or we walk. I'm freezing to death. - Well, we walk. - In these clothes? - No, listen, we have something in the trunk. We've got plenty of warm clothes in there. - [Announcer] Snow mobile racers, get on your mark, get set. (engines rev) (climactic music) (crowd cheer) - Hey, look at that! - The diamonds are right here in the lodge, I know it, I can feel it in my bones. I know they're gonna show up, it's an inside job. Diamonds are here, I know they'll show up. (crowd laughs and chatters) - [Charlotte] If I never see another snowfall the rest of my life, it'll be too soon for me. - [Winford] Oh, chin up, darling, we're bound to see sort of civilization sooner or later. - [Charlotte] Yeah, well the way I see it that means later. (engines rev) - That's strange, one of the contestants is going off the course. He's going in the wrong direction over the hill towards the village. - Hey, let me see that, let me see that. Let me see it! You're right. That's the, I knew that guy would show himself. I knew it, I knew it, I was right, I was right! Here hold onto this. (dramatic music) - Hey, you can't do that, that's my snowmobile, come back here! Hey, stop, come back here, hey, stay off of that, come back here! (engine revs) Come back! Get off! Come back, get off of here! (climactic music) (man hollers) (engine revs) (engines rev) (man and woman breathe heavy) (wind howls) - Winford, wait, I think I hear something. - You're right, you're right, baby, it's a sound of engines. - Oh, oh. - I told you we'd be saved. (engines rev) (dramatic music) (man laughs) Hallelujah baby, I told you we'd find something to get out of here with. - I'd rather see a St. Bernard with a keg around his neck. I'm frozen stiff. - Now all I could do is just get this thing started. If we could just. Oh come on, baby, come on baby, turn over. (engine revs) Ah! (man laughs) Come on! Let's get out of here! (engine revs) (climactic music) (dramatic music) (man whistles) - Hey come back here, hey come back, you can't take my snowmobile! Hey you, stop, come back here! (quirky music) (quirky music) (dramatic music) (engine revs) - What the, where'd the guy go? (engine revs) (engines rev) (upbeat music) (dramatic music) (man hollers) - Mrs. Farthington, you found them, I don't believe it, you found them. - Found them, found what? - Oh, thanks, I love you, the missing diamonds of course. - Oh yeah, the missing diamonds. You know what I just found them laying right here in the snow. - I love you. - Isn't that unbelievable. I just, you know, it's such a shock, I couldn't believe it. - Quick thinking darling. - There's pain right here, a lot of pain. - Oh, gee. - Don't move, don't move, just stand still. - Just lay still. - I think it's busted. - Oh, it probably is. - Just lie down. - Just take it easy. - What do you mean it probably is, the pain. - Mr. Flemming. - Right here, lots of pain, right there. - Okay, okay. - Pain here too. - Just relax. - We'll get you back. - [Man] Yeah, put your legs down, put your legs down. (upbeat music) - And now to our fearless and dedicated manager who risked his life to retrieve the lost diamonds, who relentlessly pursued his self-appointed task of investigation without arousing suspicion, our deepest appreciation to Mr. Victor Flemming! (crowd cheers and claps) - It was nothing. - Oh, my hero. - And our first award goes to Tom for his outstanding efforts on the slopes. (audience claps and cheers) And our second award goes to Barbie Sinclair for her fantastic efforts on the slopes and losing her way. (audience claps and cheers) And now it is my distinct pleasure to award this check for $25,000 as a reward from the insurance company to Mr. and Mrs. Farthington III for their outstanding and stalwart efforts to retrieving the lost diamonds. (audience claps and cheers) Again, I'd like to thank all the participants in this week's races who so generously contributed their time and effort and a reminder that all the proceeds are donated to our winter camp for young skiers, our future champions. (audience claps and cheers) - Charity begins at home. - Huh, what? - We know don't we? Like we'd like some gold-plated wire cutters. I mean, after all a girl deserves something for all her trouble. - You wouldn't dare, your husband. - Oh, wouldn't I? Can you be sure? - Easy come, easy go. - Ladies and gentlemen, my wife and I couldn't possibly accept this check, instead, we'd like to donate it in Mr. and Mrs. Flemming's name to the winter camp for young skiers. - Great! (audience claps and cheers) - Class, real class. - I don't know what to say, that's fabulous. - And once again, let me thank them both for a most accommodating vacation. - Again, we'd like to thank you all for coming here this evening and please come back to the Matterhorn Ski Club. (audience claps and cheers) (pleasant music) (sings in foreign language) - Hey. - Hey. 25 grand right in the palm of my hand. I can't believe it went to her favorite charity. - Oh, don't worry, darling, at least we had a good time here, compliments of the management. Wasn't that a great party they had last night? - Oh, great party my foot. - Listen, we couldn't pull it off here, we'll pull it off somewhere else. We've got plenty of stock certificates left, don't worry about it. Come on, we're going to Acapulco remember? Land of sunshine, mariachis, Tequilla, whew! (upbeat music) (plane drones) - [Announcer] Welcome aboard flight 795, nonstop to Mexico City. (upbeat music)
