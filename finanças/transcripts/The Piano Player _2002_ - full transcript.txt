♪♪ [ Woman Singing In French ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] ♪♪ [ Continues ] ♪♪ [ Ends ] [ Man Over P.A. Speaking Indistinctly ] [ Man ] Good afternoon, sir. Sergeant Tyler. [ Race Bell Ringing ] This is Christo's gang. I think you knew the victim, Sam Latham. Three 18-year-old prostitutes mutilated to send him a message. Here I got two prosecutors... burned to death for refusing to accept bribes, hmm. Look at these pictures, Mr. Nile. Look at them. Tell me you don't feel embarrassed to count Christo among your clients. Now, we picked up a guy last night. We can't identify him. But we believe he's Christo. We have nothing to connect him to any crime. There's no legal way we can hold him. Mr. Nile, the word on the street is that you're laundering money for him. You're the only person we know who can identify him. [ Nile ] Captain Tyler, my relationship with my clients... is bound by strict confidentiality, and if you think that I'm gonna break that confidentiality for you, you can shove it up your fuckin' ass! Oh! Alex. What's happening, baby?How are ya? How are you, my friend? Good. Fine. So? So you can tell your client it's done. Good job, my friend. Good job. Don't blow it all at once.Don't worry. Well, I've gotta go. Wait. I've gotta talk to you. It's important. Annette! Give me two pastis, ma cherie. I have a big client. I mean, serious. A black guy. He's called Mlambo. He wants his accountant to testify against some motherfucker called Christo. Last week, the cop picked up the cunt while busting some other fucker. The money man has the evidence to get him banged up for life. Mlambo wants you to protect this guy. You go and you take care of him. How much?Fifty thousand dollars now, and 150,000 when he goes to court. Good money. Just one thing. It's in Cape Town. You're kidding. You're fucking with me, right? Fuck, Alex, all right, all right. That whole thing was 30 years ago. Thirty years. Wanna sleep on it? Yeah, but... I can't promise anything. [ Man ] I don't think it's a good idea for you to stay here in town... until after the trial is over. Christo will hit us with everything he's got when he finds out. I love Cape Town. I'm not running like a rat. [ Sighs ] For 30 years, I only made one rule for all my customers-- I never ask a question I didn't want the answer to. I managed their cash. No books, no paper trail. All based on trust. Christo does not belong to my world. You're right, Robert, but when show time happens, none of our partners are gonna back you on this. As long as you understand you'll be alone. I sure do, my friend. Robert, I'll be back in my office if you need me. Give my best to Marge. I'll double the security around the outside. That's a good idea. [ Car Alarms Blaring ] [ Horns Honking ] ♪♪ [ Piano: Classical ] ♪♪ [ Continues ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] [ Plane Engines Roaring ] Just so you know, I'm head of security for Mr. Nile. I have no problem with that, Mr. Farrel. [ Horn Honking ] Now you get out of here. I don't know why you're here, Mr. Laney. But dealing with Christo is something else, huh? Something you Europeans wouldn't understand. You know, the kaffirs say he's sangoma. He just has to think about killing you and you're dead. You don't know Africa, man. We have different rules here. He's a legend-- a ghost. Up until a few days ago, the police weren't even sure he existed. [ Footsteps Approaching ] - I'm Robert Nile. - Sir. Come on. According to some people, you have a reputation. While you're here, you run your job. You make sure that I run mine. I run the show. Mr. Laney, I don't believe you've met my assistant, Helena. Alex, is it? Alex Laney, sir. Hmm, Alex Laney. Helena Taylor. What is it? Hello, Mr. Laney. She said no. Get Farrel. That'll be all, Mr. Laney. Thank you, sir. [ Children Shouting Indistinctly ] This is a family matter. You stay in the car. Here. Stop here. [ Doorbell Buzzing ] [ Woman Panting ] Miss Nile, I'm Alex Laney. I work for your father. - Pack up. We're leaving. - I'm not! Get out of my house! Get the fuck out of here, otherwise I'll-- Come on. Let's go. You're a sick man.Try to find a safe place. - What are you talking about? - Just do it. Trust me. Your dad is waiting for you. This is for your own good, darling. [ Man On Walkie-Talkie, Indistinct ] Will someone explain to me what this is all about? Am I your prisoner or something? Erika. I've had to make some very important decisions about my life. And about mine as well, it seems.I want you to understand. Bringing you here was for your own safety, not to invade your privacy. - I mean, we are in danger. - No, you are in danger. You're my daughter.Since when? Erika, don't make things so difficult. I may not be a perfect father, but I-- I believe in my own way... that I did my best to raise you. Sending your child to a boarding school in Switzerland doesn't make you a respectable man. I don't want my life to look like yours. Look who you've become and who you are. You're an embarrassment. You're a crook. [ Sniffles ] Just go. I'm sorry. You're not even capable of sorry! Who the fuck do you think you are? ♪♪ [ Piano: Classical ] ♪♪ [ Continues ] - ♪♪ [ Stops ] - We have to take Mr. Nile into the city tomorrow. For his deposition at the prosecutor's office. He has to show up in person. I've mapped a route for you. Study it. [ Door Closes ] [ Laney ] What the fuck-- [ Gunshots ] Let's go! Come on! Let's go! Move, move! The judge called several times. He wants you to call him back. I will. Are you all right? Obviously, I'm fine. Mr. Laney. A friend of mine wants to meet you.

You are here to protect him. Mr. Mlambo. We were set up.I don't want to hear about it. You're here to protect him from Christo. South Africa doesn't play by any rules-- [ Continues Indistinctly ] It's very horrible how your parents were killed. Sad indeed how it happened so suddenly. The police never did find the killer, did they? I've enjoyed our little chat, Mr. Laney. We'll have to do it again sometime. [ Grunts ] [ Man Speaking Indistinctly ] [ Shouting ] Eat it! [ Shouting Continues ] [ Nile ] Give me the remote. [ Chuckles ] What is this? They're feeding the guy spaghetti? Some stranger? Then they beat him to death. Come on. Christo's lost it.
