Appreciate that. Yeah. You guys hear about the kid that went missing this morning. What I don't understand is the parents. How does a mother take a baby boy to the park - and let this happen? - Someone who can just take a child. If you have any information please contact your local authorities hotline. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and loved ones at this very difficult time. Sorry I'm late. Hi! It's okay! We're always welcoming new faces around here. Hi. I'm Nelson. Hi, have a seat.

I'm an alcoholic. Hey Russel. Welcome. This can't be good for people with sugar addiction. Oh, there, there's no such thing. You did, really, really well tonight, really well. So, how, how are you feeling about it? You know it was uhm, it was fine. Good, good. So on the, the first night. What we usually do is, link you up with a sponsor. And that's just, uh, you know, someone that you can talk to, you know, if the need arises. And, and you're lucky, because you're getting one of our veterans. Chip. Hey Chip! Come over and meet Russel. So Chip's been with us now for, Chip, four or five years? - Give or take. Yeah. - Yeah. We encourage the new sponsors to uh, go out for a cup of coffee, or even for dinner, on the first night, just to, just to get to know each other. That's of course if you've got the time. Well, as long as it's not a bar. - Uh? - I'm good. My whole body will explode. Can't get enough of this shit. I can see that. I have this, small collection of bottles at home from all over the world. Cool. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, every fucking meal you know. I'm gonna start putting this on my... fucking Cocoa Puffs. Maybe that's what you need AA for. Hot sauce. Funny. Seriously though, uh, as your sponsor I should tell you to stop. It's getting out of hand. Okay. That's a lot of sauce. You, uh, you married? No. You got kids? Nah. Christ. No wonder I'm an alcoholic. No, I mean I'm, I'm married with a kid, I uh, I knocked up a girl. Way too young and now, uh. I have a wife who won't even look at me so... Hmmm. Grass is always greener, I guess. So what do you do? Detective. - Oh yeah? Yeah. You seem surprised, dude, what you don't believe me? Nah, you look like a, you look like every, detective ever. Oh yeah, is that... - How? - You just got the greasy hair and the uh, the earring, looks good, you look good. What about you? What? - What do you do? Computers. When's the last time you had a drink? Really just gonna jump into it like that? It's part of the thing, part of the job. I have to ask questions. I just got to let you know that I ain't gonna suck your dick on the first date alright. What like two weeks, three weeks? It's been a few days. Oh. - Wow. - Yeah. What's the poison of choice? Tom Collins! - That's a classic. - Yeah. Bet you don't miss the hangovers that's good. Well you know, as fucked up as this might sound, I do. I miss everything about it. I miss the smell. Yeah. I miss that crisp sound it makes when you pour it over ice. And you swirl it around in your glass. It's like hearing fucking Christmas bells. Things immediately begin to look different, feel different, you know. It's all about that warmth. It starts from your head, and it moves right down to your feet. And you feel warmer, and warmer until you're numb. and in one fucking second, all your problems are just. Gone. Uhm. Well, anyway it's getting late, I got a work thing, uhm. Just, uh, I gotta get out of here, uhm. Let me know when we're gonna have our second date huh. It's good to meet you. Yeah, likewise. Chip? Dad, it's your turn! Sorry. Move backwards four. Bummer. Okay, let's see what we got here. Oh, move forward twelve. - Not bad, huh buddy! - Lucky! - Oh you're so close! - So close huh? Hi you've reached the Gutchells! We're not in right now. But leave a message at the tone and we'll get back to you as soon as we can, thanks. Everyone listen hey! Family meeting everybody, just listen up family meeting! So some of you heard and some of you haven't uh... but the perseverance plaque, from last year has gone missing. Yeah. So we checked all the CCTVs, Unfortunately, there were no cameras inside of the break room. What? What? Who the fuck would do that? Look, great question. I have no idea who would do a thing like this, needless to say an investigation is being done. And we will get, get to the bottom of this. and uh, persevere on. Right. Because, as the plaque says, said. That's what RTM does best. And that is what RTM is all about. On a lighter note this Thursday is bring your kids to work day. Got it, good. So, uhm, it's one week Russel. And everybody gets one of these. So, congratulations. Thank you. Hey, uhm, actually have you heard from Chip at all. Actually I haven't, uhm. It felt kind of empty without him tonight didn't it. - Yeah. - Yeah, well. I don't want to complain or - sound like a snitch or nothing but uh, - Okay. guy he just hasn't been answering any of my calls. Oh. I'll try to get a hold of him for you. I'm sure it's, probably just family stuff. Hi you've reached the Gutchells! We're not in right now. But leave a message at the tone and we'll get back to you as so- Hey get over here come on! So you just put it and it calculates it for you. Pretty cool huh? I already learned that? This is so boring. Okay, I... I'm trying, I just. This is what I do for a living so. Hey, who wants to play hide and go seek? Go ahead. Where's the chaser at? Alright there we go, we got a new one. Alright 30 seconds. Starting now! Fox! Yeah, decent work on the Torres case. - Well thank you. - I'm throwing you on something else. Fucking kidding me, I've been doing everything that you've asked me to do. - You did! And now I'm throwing you on to something else. With all due respect, I've been working the shit out of this case for eight fucking months now- - We got a missing kid in the business district! Just came in about an hour ago. Where? The RTM building. Officers already on site. Go! Okay, so apparently it's bring your kid to work day. They're saying the kid was there on second and then gone the next. They were playing a game of hide and seek. Surveillance? The only two people we have on video leaving the building in our time frame is a janitor who's been there ten years. And a delivery guy with a package. Both of their stories check out. And the interior? Every camera in that office has been wiped. Huh. That assholes a sly little cat huh. - Yeah that's what I'm saying. - What about the parents? We have the dad detained in a small room. He's, uh, he's not happy. Who's in charge? A Rick Mitchum. Apparently, he's the guy that was playing games with the kids. Alright, well uh... Let's go ahead and check him out along with every other employee that was here today. Alright. Make it thorough. If they have late or unpaid parking tickets I wanna know about it. Sir, for the love of God, please sit in your chair. I'm done sit in your chair. We will get to you later, all of you. So Mr. Mitchum. Have you had any employees that have been laid off in the past year or two, with any screws loose, criminal history anything like that? Last person laid off here is going around three years back. And you know that's still when my dad ran the place. Since I've been running it nobodies been fired- uhm that guy ended up, uh He moved up uh, Mil-Milwaukee uh with his family They're doing well we chat online. By the way I do a-a-a thorough a thorough uh background check before anyone even gets you know an interview here so that should weed out. Alright listen up. I'm gonna have to uhm, - talk to everybody that was here today. - Yeah sure. They can arrange to have them picked up, but no adults are leaving this office until I'm done. Super. So no kids huh? No I'm afraid not. Is that by choice? No I... I've just been really focused on my career. I don't think I really had time for them. But you want them don't you. I'm not really sure what you're trying to get at here. Do you want fucking kids or not? No. Not really. Can we keep the area clear please? Sauna. Well. Now I know how to get a hold of you. Yeah look I'm sorry, uh... It's been, a crazy couple of weeks at my place. - It's... - Oh yeah? - It's just been- - What's been going on? Uh. My wife's, my wife's been sick. Oh. What she got? Ce-uh, cerebral palsy. Your wife has cerebral palsy? We th-no. We thought she did. Turns out she was just feeling a little bit stiff. She's fine now it was a false alarm so. Oh, okay. Well that's uh good. Yeah, don't worry about it. So you're really a cop huh. A detective, yes. You really are a uhm, how? How did you word your occupation again what was it, uh? - Computers. - Computers, yeah. I'm the IT guy around here. That, that's interesting. Cause, as soon as I was briefed on what was going on down here the, first person that I wanted to talk to, was, the man or woman who runs all the tech. - Here I am. - Yeah here you are. I mean just who would have thought that the, the person that I wanted to talk to most was in fact my AA sponsor. Small world. Person I should trust. Person I should be able to look to if I'm having a problem. Guess what Chip? What? I've got a problem. I've got a big fucking problem. Okay, well, - I'm willing to help in any way that I can. - Yeah! You keep saying that but I have yet to witness it. But maybe now that your wife doesn't have the uh cerebral palsy. All of that can change. See I've got a missing kid, in an office. It's your office in fact and uh, Whoever took this kid was able to erase him or herself doing it. Now, everyone I've talked to here today is, pretty good with computers. You know they could draft up an invoice, make a powerpoint and all that bullshit. But, none of them, are the computer guy. The information technology man himself. But now here he is, it's you. Chip Gutchell. My mentor. My buddy. My pal. So, maybe, if you don't mind. You can dig deep down inside that tech wizard mind of yours and finally help me out. Huh? - I'm not sure I understand are you presuming I had something to do with this, - or? - No. No no I'm just, asking for your support. Chip. You know how to operate the CCTV do you not? Yeah. Did you alter the security footage here today in anyway? Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen and Twenty. Ten more seconds. Andrew! Andrew? Listen, I think it's all going to be fine. Just keep looking guys, we're RTM aren't we? Did you hide him, find him please. Look I think it's, for everybody here, uh. I mean God forbid something happened to this kid. I can assure you Mr. Gutchel something bad has happened to this kid. He is missing. Right, and like I said I'm, willing to help out in anyway that I can but right now I just uhm I gotta get my kid home to his mom, cause I know that it could have been my own so. Sure. Yeah. Yeah, well. I guess that wraps this up huh? See your way out. Okay. We're good? Hope I see you at next weeks meeting. Oh, and Chip. If I uhm, try to get ahold of you for anymore questions or, guidance. Pick up your fucking phone, okay. - Of course. - Alright. Come on, you son of a bitch. Hi baby, hi. Hey honey how is it going? You okay? Yeah. I missed you. He's alright. Are you sure? Yeah. Ok baby. Can you go ahead and get ready for bed? Okay. What are you doing? Looking for your little secret. I got a call from a Nelson Guerrera today. How long has this been going on? - Chip! - It's not going on this was years ago. - Then why did you go for a drink right when you walked in. I don't want to do this right now. I really don't want to do this, this is, It's stupid that we're even talking about this. - Okay, you know what Chip? - Just drop it. I'm uhm, I'm really fucking trying here, Okay, and I don't know. How I'm supposed to move forward, if you just keep lying to me. - No. - Chip? I don't know what you want me to do, I uh I-I-I really, I really don't because this isn't about me at the end of the day, this is about you! You lied to me for the past five years! This is ridiculous, this was years ago I don't even know why we're still talking about this. Oh yeah years ago, okay. Yeah as in the time I found you in the shed with a hose around your neck, like I don't know around that time? Yeah. Right around that time. So you're asking me to go off this theory that you got about a white married male. Who happens to be a father, living in the suburbs of Kritika county who also happens to be your AA sponsor. Which I might add, has been secretly running around cramming objects, animals and children, up his asshole. Then he somehow digests them, and he does this in sprees. Almost in serial killer fashion. Is that about it? Uh huh. I'm not entirely sure about the whole uh, digestive system part. But yeah. And it seems the more, objects this guy's putting up his ass, the stronger he's getting. That's my theory anyway. Well uh, I should ask. Has anyone else here had that experience? Thank you, thank you, so, there you are you see, it's much more common then most of us would think. So, uhm. All of us here wan to thank you, for sharing that. So Chip! We missed you last week. Would you like to share something with the group. Yeah, uhm, I apologize for my absence guys. I uh, it was a hell of a week for me so. We had a situation at my job. Missing kid, I'm sure some of you guys have heard about it. Coincidentally, Russel here is assigned to the case so I, he came into my work and I uh, got to talk to him and see him work. He's great. It's really interesting. And at home, I'm having trouble with my marriage. In what way? My wife just found out about, all this, the AA, - my addiction, everything. - You never told her about it? No. It's always easier to just, keep her out of it. Well, that's normal. That's normal. But you know... Guys! Listen. It's important, that you know, who your support system is. I mean this is one of the first things that we teach you. I know. I know that too. And I apologize again to everyone for uh, for not being upfront with you. And I take full responsibility for it. - Well with the additional stress of, have you been tempted at all to have a drink? - No. - Good. Good. Well that's a relief. I uh... I am sure, that you are gonna work through these problems. Thank you. So, Russel. That seems to be an excellent segue to you. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, my wife, wants to have you over for dinner. She's trying to get more involved with everything so. Right now? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It's probably not gonna be that great. Just kind of act like you like the food alright? Follow me. How are you liking the meetings? Do you feel like it's working for you? Well you know, uhm, I haven't had a drink. Oh. Yeah, I mean I've wanted to. On several occasions like right now for example, but I haven't so. I'd have to say the meetings I guess are working for me. For now at least. That's good. Good. Good yeah, uhm, Chip, seems to say the same thing. - Is that right? - Yeah! - He does it you know just works. - I love it. Works wonders for him. Well you know I gotta tell you this guy he's uh, hell of a sponsor for me. It's a hell of a man you got yourself right here. You should see the way they treat him at the meetings, it's like he' an old war vet or a movie star. - I don't know about that. - Oh! - Come on! - Is that right? Absolutely right, he's like our own Tom Cruise. Oh my god, wow. Okay, okay, yeah, no wonder he still goes. Yeah I know, no - no fucking wonder. - To Tom. - To Tom. - To Tom. You know. Russel's the real talk of the town. He's the real hero. I mean I can't imagine what the uh, the Lee family's going through but, it's gotta be hell on Earth. Gosh your line of work must be so intense. How's it all coming? Uhm. Well, it's a process. But it's coming. Good. Do you have any leads or anything? As a matter of fact, I think we're getting pretty close. Well that's good! That's good right? - Yeah. - So uh, how are you feeling? What do you mean? Chip told me about the health scare. She's good. You look fine. I'm fine. - You're fine. - Thank you. Oh, you're sweet. What about you no girlfriend? Huh? No lucky lady? Well you know, job keeps me busy, it's my first love. You never wanted kids? Uhm. Maybe someday. - You know what? - Hmm? I have a very cute friend. Well there we go. Tiffany? Okay, I'm sorry can't you see it Chip, Russel here and Tiffany? Yeah. I can see it, yeah. We'll have to do a double date or something. - I'm gonna talk to her. - Okay. Then I'm gonna have Chip let you know. - Alright that'd be fine. - Okay. Okay. We could go, bowling or something. Do you bowl Russ? No. Well you know what she will actually be at Marty's birthday party. - Oh. - Yeah. So uhm, I mean I don't know if uh, - laser tag is your thing but, - Well. she'll be there. So. I'll go ahead and check my schedule see what I can do. Okay, yeah. It'll be fun. Well, uhm, I'm so sorry but I better put that little asshole to bed. - Yeah. - Thanks babe. Absolutely. Anytime. Thanks for the dinner. - It' delicious. - You are so welcome. Take the bottle away. You boys better not dig into my wine okay! That was fun. Yup. Yup. Actually, you know what? Hmm. I got this real long drive ahead of me. I really gotta take a shit. You mind? - You gotta shit right now? - Yeah. Alright. You sure, cause- Yeah, it's fine. Thank you. Hey I probably should have told you but that bathroom can act a little bit funny. I'll figure it out. Yeah, I should have had you use the other bathroom. I'm already, halfway in. So. I think maybe we should try to, speed it up if we can. I really gotta get to bed. I gotta be up tomorrow. Okay. Can you please walk away from the door? Sure. What the fuck are you doing? - I think you need to come out. - Just step, the fuck, hey, Chip. Just step away from the door alright? Alright just open the door. Chip! Back up from the door right fucking now! Is everything okay? Yeah, uh, door got jammed here. Sorry, to wake you. I get claustrophobic. Oh. - Thanks again for the dinner. - Of course. Come on. Come on. Stupid fucking detective. I'm down at the power plan- ah! The fuck! Everything that I'm telling you is backed up on that disc. Get the fuck out of my precinct. Okay honey, just wait right here okay. Alright. Well they said you can get out of here in a couple of hours if you're feeling up for it. I just don't know why you had to leave the house last night. I- Look I want everything to get better. I want us to get better. I want you to know that I'm done, for good. And I'm sorry for everything. Yeah me too. You shouldn't be here Russel. Do you need me to call someone? Okay. Happy Birthday dear Marty. Happy birthday to you. Happy Birthday. Happy birthday. You never wanted kids? Happy Birthday. You never wanted kids? - You got kids? - Nah. You never wanted kids? Maybe someday. Everybody shut up, everybody shut up! When I'm talking, thank you so much. We have a golden rule here, that is no running. Okay. On the count of three I want to hear you say it: One, two, three! No running! Lovely. Second rule very important: no cursing, no yelling. On the count of three I want to hear you say it again: One, two, Three. No cursing! No yelling! Good. Now onto gameplay. This is your gun. And this is your vest. Okay, you're gonna have sensors on the chest, and on the back. That's what you're aiming for on the opposing team. Oh, one more thing you guys. Have fun out there. Have fun. Who are you? That fucking smell. You'll get used to it. You're Andrew Lee I presume. - How do you know that? - Everyone's looking for you kid. So you're gonna answer me? Huh? Who are you? I'm the guy who's gonna get you out of here kid. It's a fart! Run. Do you know who I am? Is that your son? What is all this? This was all the stuff he shoved up his ass. Would you say it's better than last week? - Oh yeah, yeah, uh. The physical therapist has been a miracle worker. - Significantly better. - Good. Okay so on a scale of one to ten, one being the least amount of pain and ten the most what would you say? - Probably around a three. Great! Glad to hear it. - Okay. - We good. Right now I'd like to do a thorough examination. - So. - What does that mean? Take off your pants, turn around and face the wall. Just checking for any internal bleeding. Dear father, thank you for this meal we are about to eat. Thank you for keeping us safe. Alive. In this crappy situation. No pun intended. We hope one day soon you can get us out of here.

When all this went down I was, uhm, I was out of control. I would have one drink, and that would lead to another. And another and you just fall into that spiral again. I know all of you guy know what I'm talking about. I apologize for not being honest with you. I was ashamed, I was scared, I was so many things. And now I look across and see this empty seat, and I realize how minimal my problems really were. How much worse off it could have been for me. It's weird cause, the irony of it all is... I have no desire to drink. At any time, you know, a very sick, sick man could come back to get me and my family It's strange you know, I'm not, I'm no longer scared. Thank you.
