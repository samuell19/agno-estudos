To Your Imperial and Royal Apostolic Majesty, Maria Theresa, Archduchess of the Austrian hereditary lands etc., Queen of Hungary, ditto of Bohemia and Moravia, Duchess of Lorraine, Royal Margravine of etc. - All the titles, then? - Well, of course, you idiot! Heading: Detailed report by Count Carnero, senior representative of the Imperial Viennese secret moral police, also Royal Commissioner for the repatriation of exiled Hungarians and amnestied collaborators with the regime of the Turkish pashas in Buda. Paragraph. My special mission was to trace the old Lord of Barinkay from Banat, that is, his only son and heir S?ndor Barinkay, later known by the name of "The Gypsy Baron". The high order took your Majesty's obedient servant on fearsome adventures through the newly acquired voivodship of Hungary, deep into the Bosnian and Macedonian provinces of the Ottoman arch-enemy. I managed to identify him in the suspect location of a Turkish bazaar, where he was earning his keep with distinctly suspect artistic practices. A bright spark, though orphaned early, I roamed all over the world, I was the factotum of a big circus. I ruled the whole animal kingdom from whale to golden pheasant, the rattlesnake petted me, the rhinoceros stroked my cheek. The lion crawled on the ground before me, the tiger fed from my hand. I was on the best of terms with the hyena, I showed my teeth to the crocodile. The elephant used his trunk to dress my salad in the bowl. Indeed! Indeed, I give you my word I can do all that and even more! If it can be done somehow or other it really isn't difficult. Word of honour, he can do all that and still more! If it can be done somehow or other it really isn't difficult. Then I travelled with rare specimens as an acrobat and medicine man and at the end I was assistant to a sorcerer! I called ghosts by the dozen into my black magic circle, I was an ardent fire-eater and swallowed knives to aid my digestion. A high-wire artist like the Japanese, an incomparable quick-change artist, I can perform splendid card tricks and am even better as a card sharp. I'm a magician of importance and all without any training. Indeed! Indeed, I give you my word I can do all that and even more! If it can be done somehow or other it really isn't difficult. Word of honour, he can do all that and still more! If it can be done somehow or other it really isn't difficult. In accordance with the order I arranged for the return of said Barinkay to his ancestral estates, graciously made possible by your Majesty. As far as the eye can see this is your land. No proper boatman is ever afraid of the water; therefore boldly trust your boat without fear, though it may rock. Come, travel with me, my pet, we'll steer towards married bliss. Don't be afraid. Now we are two, if things go wrong I'll be with you. I also told him about the overflowing war chest that was supposed to have been buried around here when Mehmet Kuli Pasha fled and which had never yet been found. Day after day, working like dogs with pick and shovel, the place where the treasure is hidden, I've missed it again! The more you search the more I mock you. Oh, curse it, curse it! So where exactly are my lands? Two fathoms deep. There is your family castle and a village full of gypsies, musicians, tinkers, blacksmiths and terrible thieves. Come! After I had again explained to young Barinkay that his father was suspected of collusion with the Turkish enemy and his amnesty and return home were possible only because of your supreme Majesty's mercy and the recommendation of Count Homonay, I proceeded to official restitution of the confiscated property in front of two resident witnesses. Full stop. Since all the adults in the gypsy village had gone to market and wouldn't be back till night I first contented myself with the old gypsy woman Czipra. Hey, old woman, come and look at this man. Is it possible! This is your new lord, S?ndor Barinkay. I knew you would come home. - You knew it? - What are you saying? My presentiment did not deceive me. I knew it all along. What is she talking about? What the hell! Who told you? I consulted the cards. If you can read the future tell me what fate has in store for me. Give me your hand. Soon you will be much sought after; you will inherit a great treasure. When you have married a woman who loves you and is worthy of you a dream will reveal to her where the treasure is to be found. As soon as the wedding night is past you must ask her where and how to search. Bear this in mind and don't forget: question her after the wedding night! My congratulations on your fortune. Now tell me mine, quickly. Certainly, certainly! You lost a loved one, as skinny as a rabbit. It won't be long and you will find someone as large as a ten-gallon drum! Ajewel which you had misplaced, no bigger than your hand, soon you will find it, as slim and slender and as tall as a bean pole! Yes indeed, you'll find it this very day... ...as stout as a ten-gallon drum, what fun! A second one, too, mark well, as slim and slender and as tall as a bean pole! Old woman, take note that I have never lost a loved one. Enough of this fortune telling. Come closer, old woman, and sign as witness this piece of paper. Then we will haste to Zsup?n, my second witness. Oh, dear, I'm not much good at writing. Well, then quickly draw a cross on this document to witness it. Get on, it's no pact with the devil! - Go on, do it! - If you command I must obey. Look at this cross: it's a pentagram! A pentagram, ha ha ha! That is the only thing I can write. This sudden disappearance, and later events, hardened my suspicions that the aforementioned Czipra was a dangerous witch. The rich pig-breeder Zsup?n came forward as the second witness, a crafty character, who had appropriated vast amounts of the Barinkay lands. His only real property was his beautiful daughter Arsena. He refused to recognize the official return of the land on the grounds that he could neither read nor write. Reading and writing was never my strong point. Even when I was just a boy I only concerned myself with pigs. I've never been a poet, drat, confound it, always just a pig breeder, poetry hasn't been my thing! Indeed, my ideal purpose in life is pig farming and ham curing. What I know best is fattening up pigs. There's not a skinny one in my whole herd. I've five thousand, fit as fiddles and round as balls. Search high and low, you'll not find finer. Far and wide, across the land, everyone knows me, the Lord of the Pigs is my name. Indeed, reading and writing was never my strong point. Even when I was just a boy I only concerned myself with pigs. I've never been a poet, drat, confound it, always just a pig breeder, poetry hasn't been my thing! Indeed, my ideal purpose in life is pig farming and ham curing. So, Lord of the Pigs, by virtue of this document, Lord Barinkay is once again the rightful owner of his ancestral lands, which you must confirm as his neighbour. Barinkay? Back? Lord of the manor? Holy Virgin of Debrecen, the devil take him! Hey, greetings, neighbour! A curse on him! Since you cannot write make a cross here. See that? A little piglet. So everyone knows it's me. So, that's all done now. - On the contrary, it's just beginning. - What do you mean? Let's speak openly. The property you've stolen from me, border disputes, hearings... I'll have to pursue you for that. Disputes? Hearings? Holy Virgin of Debrecen! Wouldn't it be better to get on together? Don't you have a beautiful daughter? To avoid unpleasant discussions your Majesty's servant Count Carnero managed to make palatable a marriage between Zsup?n's daughter Arsena and the new lord. As Zsup?n finally agreed with my suggestion, as in the Austrian motto " Tu, felix Austria, nube", the village custom of the presentation of the bride could go ahead and my difficult mission seemed to have reached a happy conclusion. Janos, go and tell my daughter Arsena to put on the best dress she has and come out immediately with her governess, and tell her there's a fine chap for her here, a suitor. Off you go now. But an unexpected blow of fate was waiting for your Majesty's most humble servant, which he would not like to keep from your Majesty. Really? A suitor? I have to see that. - I have to see that, too. - This is the Imperial Commissioner. Make sure you're nice to him, you oaf! Imperial Commissioner? By my husband's skeleton, that shape! - Ludoviko! - My God, that voice! - Heaven! - Hell! - Carnero! - Mirabella! - My husband! - My wife! What a reunion! I had lost her in 1718 at the Battle of Belgrade, twenty-four years previously. The gypsy woman was right! This was the treasure I had lost. Mirabella, my angel, did we not have children, too? Yes, a son. Here he is. - Ottokar, embrace your father! - My father! So that was right, too! Ajewel I had misplaced, no bigger than my hand, and when found again as tall as a bean pole! Did you never try to find us? I thought the Great Turk had carried you off to his harem. Yes, thank God - Thank God gracious fate saved us from worse. To find her again at that very moment! Now it's serious, my friend. Here comes my gracious daughter. The bride approaches her suitor, most beautiful to behold. Come hither, come hither! Marrying young has never been rued. Come hither, come hither! Another suitor, oh, what a misfortune! The veil still conceals me from his gaze but sunlight is warm and bright, a pretty face can quickly enchant. She is enveloped in a veil but her figure is interesting. You are not the first man who has wanted to marry me, nor will you be the last to benefit from my words. Caution speaks: have a care, my friend, a pretty face can quickly enchant! In truth, if he liked me that would be most unfortunate. Yes, most unfortunate! No, no! I shall never be his! What a splendid figure! May I? Come, do him a favour and drop that silly veil. Stop! Stop! The regulations of the Commission for Morals must not be contravened. First bring on the wedding cake! And then it is your turn, young man! - We stick to the old custom; - Oh, very well then, - yes, the cake must be brought. - bring it in. - Bring in the cake! - Yes, we will fetch it. Please taste a piece! Wedding cake, please take a piece. Come and have a look, this is the bride! Wedding cake, please take a piece. It is delicious, take a bite. When young people plight their troth that is life's finest hour; if they enter into marriage in good faith they will find much sweetness. Ah! Wedding cake, please take a piece. Come and have a look at the bride. Let me introduce myself, a suitor! This is S?ndor Barinkay, the owner of these estates, who has returned from abroad. What? Did I hear right? Barinkay? Returned? Ah! Since in accordance with tradition the cake has already been eaten let the bride remove her veil before the marriage is celebrated. If I please him, crying is of no avail; I shall have to give up Ottokar! The veil must fall so that beauty may triumph in everyone's presence. My word, what a lovely woman she is, she fills me with amazement! It is an enchanting sight, perfect from head to toe! Her face could not be lovelier, her eyes sparkle like jewels, her tiny mouth is enticing, how sweet her kiss must be! The sight which fills you with amazement is my exact replica. That is precisely how I looked when I was somewhat younger. Before I spread around the middle I was as slim as any lieutenant. For twenty miles around there was no one, civilian or soldier, no one was as handsome as me! As beautiful and charming as Apollo, indeed, every inch an Adonis! There was no one like me! - As long as he merely admires me - The figure is stunning as well, - I am not at all involved. - neither too short nor too tall, neither too slim nor too fat, in a word, just the thing for me! - But if he has come to marry me - I have travelled far and wide - I swear he will not subdue me. - but never have I seen a woman so fair! Permit me to press my suit, then I shall be happy! I shall never be his wife. I shall say No ten times over! - Whoever beholds her falls in love. - Lord, keep him from falling in love with me - Whoever sees her is enchanted by her. - and succeeding in what he hopes for. - The poor, poor fellow, - The man who captures her - one would not want to congratulate him. - is to be congratulated. - Do you like my daughter then? - Very much! - If you marry him I'll kill myself! - Don't worry, I'll get rid of him. Embrace, you have my blessing! - Stop, papa! Not so fast! - What? I can marry only a nobleman. - Noble? - Yes, if you want to marry me - you must be a baron at least. - Baron? Till then you may consider me your bride but there will be no marriage, and that's an end to it! Your servant, dear bridegroom. - Tonight on the balcony. - I'll be there! But unfortunately my clever plan was thwarted by the obstinate Arsena, who was in love with my son Ottokar and secretly betrothed to him. And, a most moral betrothal, which as Royal Commissioner on morals I could not object to. Arsena's crafty demand to marry only a baron and K?lm?n Zsup?n's refusal, understandable from a moral standpoint, to allow Barinkay into his house led to scandalous nightly occurrences, which I permit myself to describe below and in which a gypsy girl called Saffi, whom I have not yet mentioned, apparently Czipra's daughter, began to play a major part. No one an earth is as wretched and faithful as a gypsy. O beware, beware the children of night! If you so much as hear a gypsy, wherever there are gypsy women, man, watch your horse, women, watch your child! The gypsies are here! Flee as best you may and fear the gypsy! Wherever he turns up he is a fierce enemy! Beware, beware and fear the gypsy! Wherever he turns up, hey ho, he comes as an enemy! I know that song! My mother often sang it. Czipra, who is this lovely girl? My daughter. Saffi, this is your new lord. Lord! I've already heard. Who will show me to my old house? My daughter will take you. Come, sir. What's that? Come! Arsena! Arsena! Yes, yes! Your faithful swain is waiting for you on the balcony! Here I am! What the devil! This is getting interesting. It's that popinjay Ottokar! There's whispering in the trees; let your heart speak! The night invites us to enjoy love; heart presses to heart in delight. I hold you in my arms, whatjoy! Let me embrace you! I can hardly believe my eyes! O tender night... Gently, gently! - ... love keeps watch. - Don't laugh too soon! - That ridiculous suitor... - ... is making a fool of himself. - Beware, beware, - Oh, what delight... revenge keeps watch! ...O tender night! - Are you going to marry him? - I shall be yours as long as I live. - You flirt, you shall tremble! - Beware! - We shall laugh him to scorn. - Revenge keeps watch. As a token of my love let me give you this brooch. Its golden clasp contains my portrait, true to life. How courteous, truly charming! Did you see the golden token of his love? A betrayal without equal! - I'm bursting with rage. - Oh, do take care. The golden clasp contains his portrait, true to life. - Let me in! - No, that cannot be. The gypsies are here! - I must go in. - And you will remain mine? - Yours as long as I live. - Beware, beware... Good night! - ... revenge keeps watch. - Love keeps watch. Oh, what's this sound? Listen, do you recognize these songs? - Those shouts, that singing! - Our people are returning. O beware, beware the children of night! If you hear gypsies, wherever there are gypsy women, man, watch your horse, woman, watch your child! The gypsies are here! This song fills my whole spirit. It sparkles and burns, faithful and clear, bright and true. That's how it shall always be. This song, oh, how it sparkles and burns! Fate deals me pain and honour in turn. - You are their lord. - She will explain. I can hardly understand it, I am a stranger to you. I myself do not yet know this country or you. You may safely trust the gypsies, you can rely upon them as on rocks, and if your weary head you wish to place here you may feel secure, you are their lord. Brothers and sisters, draw near and listen: our commander has returned to us. He is restored to us. Come quickly to swear your fealty, everyone. Come quickly! How great is ourjoy! The commander has returned! Yes, the commander has returned! I bless the hour at which I arrived here. A faithful people and a faithful man are once again united. They are quite entranced and none can resist. I'm their commander. Well, well, that really suits me very well. - I accept your homage! - He accepts our homage! Come quickly! Then let him remain our master. Our goods, our lives are his to command. As he will always be true to us so let our lives be devoted to him. Now let us go to the neighbour's house. Knock at the door, fetch the pot belly! What's up? Have my pigs escaped? No, Lord of the Pigs, just me. What important message has he got at this late hour? - You wanted your son-in-law to be... - ... a baron. A baron. That's what I am! Yes, it's amazing! - A baron, a baron! - He's a baron! - Yes, he's a baron! Come and have a look at these people; they are all subject to me. I am their commander, their Baron, and the gypsies' throne is mine. At last I have returned to my ancestral home. Please take note of my words: I am their Baron, yes, their Baron, that is who I am. This is where your cradle stood. Ah, you only knew it as a child but Hungarians, faithful in heart and deed, are faithful in the first place to their country. See, his face is aflame, see, his eyes are sparkling! Resound, my familiar song that pierces your very soul. Blindly do we trust in you because we are your people. Her song is tender and sweet... Lord, faithfully repay our trust! ...tenderly does its sound engulf me. Let me stay with you. I am your trusty servant. A wild passion draws me to her... Though I am only a poor gypsy child. ...holding my heart and mind captive! Commander of the gypsies? - Now will you accept me? - That is too presumptuous! Ennobled by grace of the gypsies! Adding insult to injury! My friend, you are too impetuous. That was not what we had in mind! I'll show you what I had in mind. This girl shall be my wife! Sir, that is a cruel jest! I know you have a faithful heart; it will protect me from that woman! He's chosen the gypsy, ha! Proud beauty, I'll have no more to do with you! The girl cannot go with you. It contravenes morality. She must stay here. - She's coming with me! - How dare you? If the commander is in danger his troops will protect him. Hold on! You can't do that. I'm furious, I'm choking, I'd like to wring his neck! Has this fellow returned to cause a pack of trouble? I've really had enough! I'll not be made a fool of! In order to show off you have humiliated the proud beauty. You dare to mock us all; we'll put a stop to that! In order to show off you have humiliated the proud beauty. You dare to mock us all; we'll put a stop to that! Sometimes these fine folk have to be taught a lesson, even if they would like to put up some resistance! I'm afraid, as much as it irks you, you'll have to leave her here. To carry off a girl just like that, I think you ought to be ashamed. Just let them shout and scream. I can hardly believe it: you want to forsake her to marry me? He has chosen Saffi, how honest he is. He has chosen a gypsy girl to be his wife. - Your dirty tricks have been exposed. - Oh, what language! - Never shall she be my wife! - This calls for vengeance! Sweet confusion holds me enthralled. Oh, whatjoy! I'll pay him back for his insolence. - You'll pay for that! - Be not afraid, lord. - Haul them before the court! - Away with you, coward! - Don't you dare come near us! - Oh, what agony! - Be on your guard, everyone! - Oh, what a scandal! Oh, what a terrible slanging match! Let me be on my way with my love. Are you challenging us, you tinkers and horse copers? Now we've seen through you we'll all depart before there's a fight. Ha, the gypsy army has resisted you all. Only to him who merits it - shall I give my hand. - will he give his hand. Once again accept our oath of fealty. Our goods, our lives are yours to command. We shall certainly be avenged; the insolent fellow will not escape. This is my throne because I am the Baron of the gypsies! - Beware, beware! - Faith will keep watch. He's quite a fellow, this S?ndor Barinkay... What else does Carnero write? As guardian of propriety and morals I was able to reconstruct the indecent goings-on on Barinkay's first night in his father's house down to the most intimate and scandalous detail. The aforementioned Czipra not only agreed to Saffi spending the night with the new master but even watched over them and acted as procurer. Well, I never! My eyes keep watch by day and night over this sweet young thing and my master's property. Was it a dream? I hardly know what brought me here and made me so happy. - No, it is no dream. - If it might come to pass - There she sleeps, so gentle and calm. - that love's warm rays - Awake, my darling wife, awake! - should conquer him - My wife, awake! - then grief is at an end. The sun will soon be here. Your wife? Are you still mocking me? God forbid! You are the only one for me. - Dare I really think this is true? - Yes, I have chosen you to be my wife! In this night of starlit beauty I beheld you, my dearest. The moonlight, so pure and silver, surrounded your image with tender charm. I was completely enchanted; it seemed a fairy tale, yet true! Your angelic face, your abundant hair, these bright eyes, this pair of lips, your kissable mouth, your sensuous body, the most wonderful woman in all the world! Be mine, be mine for evermore! I shall love you truly and sincerely! I shall love you sincerely! Oh, speak these words again that fill my innocent heart! They trickle over me like morning dew which refreshes the parched meadows. Oh, joy that I can hardly comprehend, you wonderful, beloved man! Say it once again! Eye to eye and mouth to mouth, oh, what bliss, what a happy hour! Arm in arm, so tender and warm, what heavenly joy pierces my heart! Mine, mine, mine for evermore! Just like a fairy tale, yet it is true! Obviously Czipra knew the location of the war chest left behind by the last pasha fleeing from His Apostolic Majesty Leopold VI's Christian armies under his commander Prince Eugenio de Savoie. Under the flimsy pretence of a dream she encouraged the chosen man to take his spade to the old walls. An old man appeared to me in a dream, his face and bearing were just like yours. When I saw him it seemed to me that he was bound to be your father. He approached me, then he said: Where the young lord of the manor rests with his beloved for the first time there lies, hidden from prying eyes, rich treasure. Let the young lover raise a marble slab in the wall of the old tower and he shall be another Croesus! That's the sort of dream I like. And here's the ruined tower! The dream is true! The treasure is mine already, that's as clear as daylight. Do what your duty bids you! My dear, do have some sense. Why not try, what is the risk? Why not try, what is the risk? That's a puzzle for the devil: one stone is just like another. Look, he's laughing, he doesn't believe me. Indeed, he looks quite incredulous. But what a lovely dream promises in the night must be followed up, I insist on it! Before the crowd of gypsies has woken up, yes, step by step everything shall be revealed. And that which now he will not believe shall all come true! - Therefore tap, tap, tap every slab, - If you insist, I'll do it, - it's bound to be one of them. - I'll tap every slab. - Therefore tap, you won't be sorry, - I'll tap, tap, tap, what can it matter, - until the hammer finds the marble slab! - until I find the marble slab. This sounds hollow. I do believe that I can shift it! My, what a sight! The treasure, the treasure! Just look at that sparkle! Oh, what splendour! Oh, who would have thought it! See how it sparkles and glitters and sings! What a delight for our eyes! Look at the gold, how sweetly it rolls. Let us listen to its sound, full ofjoy, since what we wanted has come to pass. Now I shall enjoy life! We'll keep horses and grooms! We'll entertain as much as we like! - Invite guests! - Give parties! - Fancy-dress balls! - Cotillions! We'll drink champagne and wine, we'll have a lovely time. But don't forget the most important thing: so that everyone may call you fortunate you must make wise use of your riches in order that later on in life you can still say, full of contentment: See how it sparkles and glitters and rings! What a delight for our eyes! Look at the gold, how sweetly it rolls. This is the treasure for which we longed! But love and fidelity are stronger bonds than gold and cash; the greatest happiness will lead us into the loveliest world. Therefore, if there's a heart that truly beats for you, you must praise the hour that brings it to you! See how it sparkles and glitters and sings! What a delight for our eyes! Look at the gold, how sweetly it rolls. This is the treasure for which we longed! When we visited the den of vice the following morning we were met by the deceptive sight of industry, which, however, we were not taken in by. Wake up, wake up! The night is over, the day has broken! Get to work, it is day! Wake up, get to work! Ah, the iron is growing malleable: cauldrons, scythes, ploughshares, hey, forge keys, knives, sickles, hangers, nails, padlocks! But if enemies threaten the country then the valiant slogan is: No more hangers, no more knives, no more ploughshares, no more padlocks! Forge the iron ever stronger, make them praise our swords! Blow upon blow, every day. Ding, dong, the iron is singing, ding, dong, for everything in life! We draw the iron and make strings of steel. Let them praise the sun, the valley. The joyous tunes dispel care, yes, they dispel care. Be they happy or sad. I intended to avenge the offended authorities by punishing the arrogant gypsy pasha and his easy going lass. What is the reason for your early visit? Against my orders, you have not sent the gypsy girl away - and have made an unlawful union! - Choose your words carefully or...! - Are you threatening me? - She is my wife! - Your wife? Who has joined you in sacrament and law? Who married you? And I received an astounding answer that seemed to me sacrilege and blasphemy. - Who married us? Go on, tell them! - You tell them! The cardinal bird married us. The cardinal bird married them. The blue sky was our cathedral. Just look how lovely it is, full of splendour and majesty! Studded with golden stars as far as the eye can see! The gentle nightingale sang her song all night. Love, love is a blessing from heaven. Finch, nightingale and stork. It must be said that such matrimonial authorities stand in blatant contravention of the rules of the morals commission. He's right, old Carnero. Just, when I think about it: if we were to explain that love is no heavenly power we wouldn't go down well with the Viennese and certainly not with her Majesty! Carry on. I was unable to pursue the punishment of this contravention because the treasure had meanwhile been found, something my rediscovered son Ottokar had long endeavoured to do, and its value could now be seen by all. There's the treasure! - The gold! - Hands off! - Stop! Let go! What are you thinking of! I tried to stop the fight that broke out because there was no doubt that the trove rightly belonged to the Imperial Treasury. But the gypsies were opposed to your Majesty's official. Then we heard that Count Homonay had come to nearby Peterwardein to recruit, to gather troops in anticipation of war in Spain. Naturally we all went to him at once. Give me your hand, it's got to be, say farewell to your darling, quaff the recruiting wine with us, come and join the hussars! Take the shako, forget your hat, come and join our ranks! Let the enemy find out that your sabre works wonders! Take the shako, forget your hat, come and join our ranks! Let the enemy find out that your sabre works wonders! Shake on it, shake on it! Brother, join the army, let us recruit you, come, the Hungarian army must be victorious or die! It would be better for our blood to dye its country's soil than that any hand should falter while fighting the enemy! It would be better for our blood to dye its country's soil than that any hand should falter while fighting the enemy! Shake on it, shake on it! We all want the cheer of a full glass of wine, fiery wine so bright and clear, how the hussar loves it! Hey! And where there's wine there's pleasure and all the girls look lovely, how the hussar loves them! Hey! Don't be shy, kissing is a duty to the hussar. You and your lad make a smart pair! Love is like wine so sweet, as sweet as your kiss! Come here, that the hussar understands! Love and wine should be the spice of life! Both sweet and clear and true, just as the hussar loves them! Now drink the recruiting wine and take up arms! Fool! - What's happening to the poor devil? - He was recruited. - Does he have to join the army now? - Clink glasses! Holy Virgin of Debrecen, this wine is excellent! - Give me another gulp. - Me, too! As you wish. You can drink as much as you want of this but once you've drunk you come along! You swap your hat for a shako, you shake hands and it's all done. So, that would be the handshake! The fool, did you see? The fool gave him his hand. This handshake is done, too! Father! Ottokar! - I want my son back! - I want my father! They've assented to recruitment and that's an end to it. - Oh, Zsup?n! - Hey! Leave me! - Ottokar! - My Arsena! Till now I had modestly held back. Although he had enlisted my son in the army I asked him, in all respect, to interrupt recruitment for a few moments. In connection with important official duties against Barinkay, who had the count's recommendation to thank for his royal pardon and failed that trust on his return home, which seemed to me to show immense ingratitude. Your Lordship is making a bold assertion! The proof is here! If your Excellency would like to see for himself? I led the count to the treasure. My goodness, congratulations! Barinkay found this treasure during the night. - Found on his land! - It belongs to the state! - The money is his! - Higher authorities must decide! I shall end the argument. Since my country is in need, - please, take it all! - You are a true patriot! Have you finished with your accusations? No! Despite my objections and contrary to official authorities Barinkay took this gypsy girl home! I would have done the same! I will not have authority treated with disrespect! - Lord Barinkay and his easy going gypsy bride - Careful! will have to answer to the moral tribunal in Vienna! Sir, your mission was to take Barinkay back to his lands. What your comedy with the moral commission has to do with it... - Comedy? - That's what I say! You seem to forget we're on Hungarian soil! I myself will present a report and that's an end to it! And with that conclusion it only remains for your Majesty's maltreated servant Count Carnero to summarize the following events. I was wreathed in the glory of dignity and now I stand here like a silly ass. Please bear in mind that authority, - you must understand... - ... has gone to hell! And all on account of this rabble! - These vagabonds! - Sluts, villains, thieves! This infamous lot must be taken to court! That's enough, I can keep silent no longer. You who insult us, draw near! Learn that she, whom you have dared to offend, is of nobler birth than all of you. I make a solemn declaration that this is not my child. - Not her child? - Not her child? I watched by day and night over her life. Count, you are a cavalier. I entrust this document to you. Faithfully have I preserved it many a year and now all shall be revealed. A document unknown to all. Hear what it says! Before you there stands a prince's child! A prince's child? - What do I hear? - Is it possible? - Speak! - Take note, all of you! Her father was the last Pasha of Temesv?r! A prince's child, what a miracle! Indeed, she deserves our pleas for mercy. - A moment ago she was a gypsy girl; - A moment ago I was a gypsy girl, - in her full glory she stands before us, - exposed to these people's mockery; - how marvellous! - now good fortune attends me! The child of the last Pasha of Temesv?r! Oh, what good fortune! It's a misfortune for me! What do you mean? Alas, I must leave you! My heart belonged to the poor gypsy maid. I dare not ask you to marry me. I must renounce the prince's child! - Alas, you do not love me! - Oh, if only it were true I could depart without grief! What? You wish to depart? I cannot understand! Because I love you - I must leave you! - Leave me? Brother, join the army, let us recruit you. Come, the Hungarian army must be victorious or die! It would be better for our blood to dye its country's soil than that any hand should falter while fighting the enemy. After the sweet bliss that I enjoyed now fate has nothing in store for me but night! Shake on it! Right, I'll be a hussar! Give me the recruiting wine! - Oh, do not speak like that! - Fill the cup! - Oh, stay at home! - Fill the cup, fill the cup! I long to plunge myself into battle. Here, comrades, take my hand! I'll sacrifice my life for love, I'll sacrifice my love for my country! Three cheers for our country! Oh, do not leave me! Oh, stay here! I neither can nor wish to. His handshake binds him, so let him go. Farewell! Farewell! Then let him go! Heaven bless your weapons! - Into battle! - Into battle! Yes! Give me your hand, it's got to be, say farewell to your darling. Victory and honour will be yours, come and join the hussars. The hussar will always protect our homeland! He never bows to the dangers of war! Though terrible death may threaten the homeland is his command! And if this duty orders it so he gives up his life and all he holds most dear! Give me your hand, it's got to be, long live our homeland! Now go with courage, off with the hussars, the enemy will see what wonders your sabre can do! Together we'll beat the enemy for all think it right! The battle trumpet sounds! Farewell, into battle, victory or death! Farewell, into battle, if the foe dares to fight us they'll discover our might! Let every man do what he can! Into battle! Hurrah! Vienna, two years later Full of the joys of life after dispute and argument they enter the Emperor's fine city where cheerful tunes resound full of vigour, where you're filled with longing for wine, women and song, where in the bright lights, singing and dancing, we shall pass the night in pleasure and rejoicing, where the vine blooms and love burns brightly, where all people know how to live! Man's heart knows nothing of grief; unending sunshine lights up his heart and passionate love. Yes, there, there we all must go where joy and delight are ever green, where life's splendour inspires every joy, where love smiles by day and night. Ah, you're in Vienna, too! I see you've taken the trouble to come and welcome our brave Hungarian troops, whose recruitment you contributed to. Madam! Your Highness will not have forgotten that my contribution... Not at all! Your report revealed to me exceptional literary gifts that you should foster and so I have this document for you. - A decoration? - A step up? This will be the end of me! - What's happened? - The commission is dissolved! - What about you? - Me, too! My well-deserved retirement! You look very pretty in Turkish costume, Princess! The Empress insisted on this dress. Her Majesty would like to see you married. Do you still feel you must be true - to this, what's his name? - Barinkay. - Barinkay, yes. - I do. Will you still turn down all the fine suitors in the land? Yes. Even if this Barinkay were a dishonourable ruffian? That could not be! I have a letter here from Count Homonay in which he writes: I have nothing good to say about him. He shirked every battle but was first to plunder and steal. - What do you say to that? - He's lying! - Count Homonay does not lie! - Forgive me, Highness. But he's not talking about S?ndor, who has shown himself worthy of you, but of this wicked K?lm?n Zsup?n. From the shores of the Tagus, where with mighty strength we brought the foe to heel, by Jove, we have returned full of glory and bearing whatever was worth taking! War is a dreadful thing. Thank heaven it's over and I've come home in one piece. Not a single blow frightened me, not a shot, not a stab wound, but my complexion is a bit tanned. Now quickly, how-de-do, friend and child, how-de-do, they're all here in the best of health, yes, yes! " Watch out, I'm shooting," a Spaniard shouted at me. " Go ahead, shoot. I'll just duck out of the way!" His rifle was empty. I snatched it from him, hit him with it and split him wide open! Smash-bang, there he lay, as dead as a doornail. Quickly I looked for his small change. " Hey, my good fellow, a pity to waste it," and I searched him down to his skin. I did that maybe twelve times, with an enemy it didn't matter. Greetings, enemy hero, greetings, watch and cash, when you fall they mean nothing! Once - scandalous! - a Spanish woman tempted me! " No chance," I say, "three steps away!" But she promised tender love, then I showed my wits again. Quick as a flash I wooed her; she gave me her snow-white hand with a diamond on it that I whisked away. Now I wear it as a token of love! Everywhere I showed my cunning, with the enemy, too! And I was as hard as steel, no soldier was my equal! Thanks to the sun, those women have lava in their veins. So many lovely women but my heart stood firm and to all I was a heartbreaker but known as just a flirt. A kiss, how-de-do, my pet, how-de-do, love has no business in enemy country, no, no! The soldiers are coming! Hurrah! Hurrah, we've fought the battle in a country far away, we've experienced the smell of gunpowder in action! Stand up straight, comrade, strike out with might and main. On your way, every man, anyone who can bear arms. Wherever the enemy shows his face we'll go for him for all we're worth! Cheerfully and full of hope, that has always been our way. You'll find us wherever there's a fight. Our motto is: Short and sweet! When the cannon thunder all around in battle we're not disheartened. Indeed it would be unfortunate if soldiers felt otherwise! Hurrah! Full of the joys of life after dispute and argument they enter the Emperor's fine city where cheerful tunes resound full of vigour, where you're filled with longing for wine, women and song... My son! Ottokar! An officer! My son, decorated! Our country can pride itself on such sons! You have all done your duty. Now you shall have your reward. Excellent. I was only defending our country! Your chest is already so covered in watches and chains there's no room left for further decorations. - What about behind? - No decorations, either! Neither front nor back! Our country is very ungrateful towards my person. But you, Lord Barinkay, will be rewarded. This document recognizes your right to the treasure and this is your letter of nobility - that makes you a baron. - Baron? Arsena, my love! Arsena, I fought for you. Is another man to...? My heart is yours, come what may! - I ask for your daughter's hand. - Baron Barinkay, son-in-law! Not for myself. This is your son-in-law. The golden clasp contains his portrait, true to life. Curses! Holy Virgin of Debrecen! But I must say, very true to life. Are you not curious about the third part of your reward? You've honoured me too much already. - The Baron must marry. - Marry? My heart belongs to the Queen. The queen of your heart? Give him your hand, trust the gypsy. Wherever he turns up he comes as your friend. - Saffi! - My lord! - S?ndor! Indeed, I give you my word I can do all that and even more! If it can be done somehow or other it really isn't difficult. Word of honour, he can do all that and still more! If it can be done somehow or other it really isn't difficult. Hurrah! Hurrah!
