- All right, Jimenes, Would you rather wake up every morning - - Already? You wanna start with that already? - It's just a way to get to know you. See what type of man you are. So would you rather wake up with cabbage, two big things of cabbage on your hands every morning and you have to eat 'em all before you can even start your day? Or would you rather have a little midget that follows you around but fucks with you, like turns out the lights when you're taking a shower or mismatches your socks, locks your keys in your car when you're not paying attention. Which one? - I will say I fucking hate cabbage. I don't like cabbage. It's gross. Little Midget, I feel like I already had that shit, 'cause that shit always happens to me, man. So think I'll do the midget. - All right. - Yeah, I'll settle with that. - That was an easy one, that was an easy one. All right, all right. Would you rather be at San Quentin with the craziest serial raper of all time? - But what's San Quentin? - San Quentin? - What is that? - Really? Like one of the worst fricking jail or prisons on earth. - Oh, okay, I was testing you, I was testing you to see if you knew what that was. - Boy. Oh boy. Okay, would you rather be in there with like this craziest rapist guy and like once a month he's gonna have his way with you and there's nothing you can do at all, like - but it's only once a month. - Okay, what's the other option? - Or would you rather go viral on TikTok, everybody in the world's gonna see it, there's gonna be memes after this, you walk outside and somebody pranks you by throwing shit at your door and it's filled with dildos and while you're trying to smash the shit out, dildos are just falling from the sky and hitting you in the face everywhere. And it goes viral. Everybody's gonna see it. - Where do you get this shit? Is this what you're always thinking about? - Yeah. - This is what you're always thinking about, wow, okay. - Well, do you see a lot going on? - I'll go with the - Fuck, man, I don't know, go with dildos. - Viral, dildos and shit - Viral, I'll be known - just smacking you. - For the dildo guy. - Okay. - Yeah. Why not? Fuck it. Fuck it. So, being on the force for two weeks now, what do you guys normally do? - This is it, drive around, parking tickets, pulling people over. I mean, it's not a glamorous job. It's not like what you see on Cops. There's not a bunch of shit going on. Nobody's really chasing us. We're not really chasing anybody. I mean. We'll probably pull somebody over tonight for something boring. Who knows what that is. I hope we don't pull anybody over 'cause I don't feel like doing paperwork. I'm just saying. - I, I agree. But I'm kind of excited though, you know? First, well, first stop. Tired of all the fucking office work. All that desk work, it's just, killer man. Have you ever fallen asleep? - Oh yeah, I take naps all the time. I mean, if you weren't here, I'd probably pull down one of these streets and take a nap right now. No big deal. Now that you're here I can take a nap all day and you can just drive around. - That's kinda strange, don't you think? - Text the wife. You married? Kids, anything? - No. No, no kids, no kids. Married once though, yeah, married once. - Really? - Yeah. - How did that go? - Huh? Not married anymore. - Yeah, I've been married for about five years now. - Kids? - Yeah, I got two kids, but I mean, it's a bunch of babies. - I bet that's awesome, though, man, to have kids? - It's cool, I mean, the wife hates me being a cop. She wants me to do a safer job, I'm like, This seems pretty safe, right? - Pretty safe, yeah. She's just asking like, "How's your partner?" - So have you had a partner before or? - Yeah, I mean, they usually choose me to do on-the-job training. - Got you. - Apparently I have a knack for walking the new guys through. Not too bad. - So this is it, huh? - Nobody's speeding, you can't make 'em speed. You hungry? - I am hungry, actually. - All right, where are we? No speedsters today. Lunchtime. Even though we've only been on duty for two hours. But I am hungry. Jimmy's, how can I get you started? - Can, let me ask you, does the number one come with onions? You said a number one combo with medium fries? - No, I said does the number one come with onions? Oh, a number one with a slushie? - No, does it come with onions? Oh, number one with no onions, I'm so sorry sir. - Oh my god. - Hold on one second. - I'm sorry, can you hear me? Kinda, can you speak up a little bit louder? I'm so sorry. - Does the number, sorry, does the number one come with onions? Does the number one come with onions? - Yes. Yeah, do you want me to take it off? - Yeah, let's take off the onions. - Okay. - Does it come with lettuce? - What, are you kidding me? What are you talking about? - I don't know, I - - Hey man, just give us two number ones with Sprites. With everything on, just two number ones with Sprites. Did you lose your mind? I don't like onions, so. You want them to spit in our food? Did you catch that, boss? Except for these pictures, go slide. - Fucking hate these things, man. You, you comfortable with these things on? - No, 'cause they can see everything I'm doing. The only cool thing is if I prop my head up like this, you don't know if I'm awake or asleep. - Oh, that's true, yeah. They're just gonna look at me. Don't look at me, puppet. - So, what, it's live feed going directly to like Headquarters or what? - That's what I've heard. I've never actually seen where the footage goes. - Oh. - I don't actually care, because I don't really do anything. - I mean, our - - I guess if you're doing something wrong, then worry about it. - Yeah, I mean, our job is to control the situation. Don't lose your head. When I was in the Marines, that's all it is, muscle memory. Everything is muscle memory. You're still new, but you'll pick it up. You'll learn when and when not to draw your gun, when to use your taser. Have you used a taser before? - I have, yeah, yeah, I did at the Academy. I had to get my ass tased before I could grab it. So yeah. - That shit hurts, huh? - Yeah. I think I pissed myself. Okay. Would you rather have the worst explosive diarrhea any time anybody sneezes around you? - Like the sneeze triggers - Yeah. You hear, - Diarrhea? - you hear somebody sneezing, you're just like. - You know what I, okay, or? - Or would you rather get attacked by a hundred hornets once a month? - Oh, fuck no. Diarrhea. - You like the diarrhea? - Yeah. I wasn't gonna - I'm all over the ass play, man. From dildos to this. Let's light this dude up. Where's he going? - I don't know.

If I cough, you might shoot me. - So. - No, we're not gonna shoot you, but yeah, we did catch you on the camera. - I could have sworn it was green. - Oh shit, hold on. You know, the funny thing is your opinion doesn't matter. Can I see your driver's license and registration, please. - See, my opinion does matter.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, Sarge, Sarge, we are at the old homeless shelter on Fifth and Carter. We need backup right away. Where are you guys at? I think we're in the northeast side of the building. - We're in the northeast side of the building. Backup is five minutes out. - Backup is five minutes out? Hey, Sarge, we ain't got five minutes. We need backup now. There's some weird shit going on here. We need you now. We're on our way. Just hold on. Hold on to what? - So we're supposed to sit here and wait? Oh, no, no, no, no, I don't know. No. Think. - Man, this makes no fucking sense. How do we not have signal in here? We're in the middle of the city and we have no fucking signal. Yeah, something's cutting off our fucking signal in here. Wait, wait wait. Don't think it's kind of weird that there's no fucking windows in here, man? There's no windows on the outside, there's nothing that can connect anyone from in here out there, It's almost like - it's almost like they're trying to keep something in here, something to control whatever's in here. It's fucking weird, man. We can't just sit here, man. We can't just be sitting here. There has to - We have to do something. God knows how far out they are. Five minutes is long time. - You know, let's just keep moving. Sarge will get back to us sooner or later. Your guess is as good as mine, man. I mean, this whole place looks like it's - We're in a fucking maze, we're going in the same circle over and over. Man, this is fucked. This is a fucked up place. This is a shelter home? - This is not a shelter, man. There's supposed to be beds. There's supposed to be things to help the people. - All right, Pete, would you rather have sex with a zombie or would you rather have sex with a 102-year-old woman who's on her deathbed? - We're doing this again? Until you pick one. And you can't kill yourself. Pick one. The the woman man, the woman. The old lady, fuck. - Disgusting. - You fucking asked. - Gross. You have a thing for old ladies. You usually do that for money, right? I think I might take the zombie, because you know it's already dead, she's not gonna say no. Dude, is there three of them? - Wait, wait, wait. - You hear something? Dude, what is that? - Is that coming from in here? Or is that ups- Hello? Hello? Jimenes! Jimenes! What? - Hey. Hey, how are you guys doing? We're Metro PD, we're here to help you, okay? Are you guys hurt? Any pain? - Can you guys walk? - Hey. Hey!

It- Whoa, shit, what happened to your arm, man? - Well, I was coming home last night, - if you could call this home. - God. - And a dude jumped out from behind a wall and started like rambling something at me and, I don't know. He just fucking bit me. Well, we'll get someone to take a look at that for you. Do you guys know of an exit? Another exit from here? - Well, there should be one up front, nearby. No, we tried that one, it was locked. Do you guys know of another one? - There's one in the back on the lower level. - Okay. - What do we have to lose? Let's go. - Let's do it. - All right guys. - Cool. - You guys ready, you guys good? You wanna get outta here? We have EMS and paramedics waiting for us on the outside to look at you guys, so. Okay? Come with us, buddy. We'll get some help for you, okay? - I'm not going to jail, am I? No, no, no, no, no. We're just gonna get you guys outta here. Doesn't look safe in here. You good? You okay? - Yes. Gonna have some breakfast, might as well. Pulled it out of the dumpster myself. Stay close, you guys, stay close. Stay nice and close. Jimenes, bringing up the rear? - Yeah. - You good? Yeah. Hey, check it out, check it out. Some cameras probably has to be a control around here, we could contact someone from here. - No, not a chance. They're monitored off-site. You sure? - Mm hmm, positive. I volunteer here. It's my job to know those things. Shit. Jimenes, we got a tent in here, man. I think this is where the smell is coming from. - We're good, keep on moving, guys. Just watch your step. Okay. So what kind of homeless shelter is this? I mean, this place is empty. Do you usually have more people? - Yeah, people come in and out all the time. - There's never an exact amount of people here. What? What do you mean, what kind of homeless shelter is this? Oh, fuck, are you okay? Oh shit! You okay? Yep. I need a second. Come on, man, we don't have time for this shit. We gotta keep moving, okay? We've got movement back here. What the fuck? - Have you guys seen anything crazy or anything outta the ordinary lately? - Just a few sick people and just some fights and that's it. - Why are you guys here? - Fights? We got called for an assault. You know, the security guard said there might be an injury here, or a possible body. We found one guy and then he attacked us. We kept moving and found another guy. He attacked us and he had this fucking crazy rage in his eyes. - Wait. We noticed there were some people who get sick and they just go to the hospital. - Yeah, we realize everyone that left sick, they never came back. Thank you guys. - We thought it was another strain of COVID or something. - COVID? Oh, no, no, no. This is something different. Oh, shit.
