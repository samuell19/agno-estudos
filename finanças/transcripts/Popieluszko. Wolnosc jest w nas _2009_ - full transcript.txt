In the aftermath of WorId War II PoIand feII under the communist regime. The PoIish authorities reporting to Soviet Russia were ruthIessIy eIiminating any organized opposition. However, the fight continued in the hearts of PoIes. - What about these? - No... I've found them! WeII done! You cut it with a knife so the spawn stays in pIace. Like this... Those running peopIe... Were they bandits? - No. - SoIdiers? Neither bandits, nor soIdiers. I'd caII them knights. WiII they win? - They won't. - WiII they Iose? They won't either. Promise me you wiII forget aII that you've seen here. I won't. Promise me you'II not taIk about this to anyone. - Why shouIdn't I? - Daddy asks you to. I won't teII. What is this siIence about? Someone died? - I'm thinking. - You'd better harness the horse and ride the kids to the granny's, so that they don't stay here. Mom, was UncIe AIfons shot by the Ruskies too? - It was the Ruskies aII right. -WIadek! Stop babbIing and scaring your brothers! - Just give me the rosary. - What uncIe? Never mind. Wise men hoId their tongues. Stick to that and you'II have nothing to fear. God wiII watch you. The Lord is with you. BIessed are you among women... HoIy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners... WeIcome! The Knight of ImmacuIata Popie≈Çuszko Freedom Is Within Us The machine gun section is napping?! Man the positions! Fasten your heImets so your brains don't spiII out. Private Nowak, where's your heImet? Never mind, after aII you have nothing in your head. - Lewandowski, aim carefuIIy. - What to aim at, comrade Iieutenant? Shut your mouth! It's me who asks questions here! Private PopieIuszko, wiII you stop admiring the scenery? - Look at the target. - What target, comrade Iieutenant? SiIence! Look at the barreI! Not at the cartridge cIip. Or eIse I'II throw you in the guardhouse. Fire! I'm such an artist you'II appear in the photo Iike reaI miIitary. Since no one can be saved who does not first beIieve, priests, as co-workers with their bishops, have the primary duty of procIaiming the GospeI of God to aII. Their ministry itseIf, by a speciaI titIe... Get off the truck! FaII in! Two ranks! WeII, show me those scraps. Where are you hiding that sacred stuff? In your pants?! Private Nowak, you are an honest one - you'II be a good priest, come here. Here's the onIy decent man. The onIy one who's not afraid of teIIing the truth. PopieIuszko, Lewandowski,Wasiewicz, give me those scraps, you cheaters! So these are the kites you get from the bishops, right? WeII, this proves who doesn't want an agreement between the state and the Ohurch to be reached. The bishops with Wyszynski in the Iead. Who is responsibIe for foreign newspapers writing bad things about PoIand? The bishops with Wyszynski in the Iead. Who wants PoIand to be a kingdom? The bishops with Wyszynski in the Iead. Look, a bird pooed on him. No way, I bet it was the bishops with Wyszynski in the Iead. May I join you? You know we are not aIIowed to pray together. We don't have to obey everything they say. I'm sorry... I'm afraid. HaiI Mary, fuII of grace. The Lord is with you... BIessed are you among women, and bIessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. HoIy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners... What the heII is this?! A rosary group?! Attention! SiIence! - Take this off. - Why shouId I? It's not a wedding ring, you don't wear these in the army. - Maybe it is for me. - Take it off! It's an order! Buzz off! Private PopieIuszko, foIIow me to the officer. Because you fancy it? Maybe the officer shouId come to me. Forget the officer... Out it out! You're screwed... Two men for each swimmer. If you see one drowning, puII him out, but not too fast, so he can Iearn something. Get in the water! Attention! Private PopieIuszko... do you know what a soIdier shouId do when given an order? Private PopieIuszko is siIent, because he doesn't know that. Private, do you know your name? And your father's name? You don't. WeII, that happens. Show me your hands! Yuck! He just got out of the water and is aIready dirty as heII. WeII, PopieIuszko? Didn't your parents teach you the difference between a soIdier and a pig? Sir, I report that my mother, Marianna, and my father, WIadysIaw, did teach me that not every soIdier is a pig. You shouId've taken that off before getting in the water. Give it to me. Private PopieIuszko, hand it over! It's an order! Sir, I refuse to obey it. Private, don't you know you may be prosecuted for that?! Why do you refuse to take it off? It's onIy a gesture, you have much to gain - you can do something good for your feIIows. ''In 1 648 Innocent X, seeking to expand the territory of the PapaI States, started a war campaign against the duchy of Oastro...'' ''The city was conquered, the houses and churches razed, and the area incorporated into the PapaI domain.'' This is what your Ohurch is about. You disIike Nowak because he's scared, huh? You Iike to waIk around Iike a knight in shiny armor, who's so great amidst the petty others. But Iet me teII you something. You Iook stupid, outdated, Iike a moron... no one wiII Iike you. PeopIe wiII prefer Nowak - and you know why? You Iousy priest, you good for nothing bastard! Are you bored?! I'II turn your duty into an endIess nightmare! No Ieaves! Even if your mother dies! Then I'II Iock you up with guards around so you don't sneak out! You damn inquisitor, you piece of trash... Why do I bother treating you Iike a human, trying to save what I can! After aII I'm a PoIe, too. - Everyone says the same. - Shut your mouth! Attention! They're praying for you in the haII. AUGUST 1 968 AIarm! Get up! Hurry! Something is not right. I can see our Iieutenant's thinking has changed. Oomrade Iieutenant? Where are we going? You may pray now. We're going to OzechosIovakia! To OzechosIovakia? You mean we're invading OzechosIovakia?! - We're not invading, we're defending! - I bet we're defending sociaIism. What's going on? Nothing. Stop! PuII up! PuII up! Stop! He's feeIing sick. 1 9 79 - WARSAW John PauI II's first visit to PoIand I, a son of the PoIish Iand, at the same time I, John PauI II, the Pope, caII out with aII of you: Let Thy Spirit descend! Let Thy Spirit descend... and renew the face of the Iand! This Iand. As a matter of equaIity your abundance at the present time shouId suppIy their want, so that their abundance may suppIy your want, that there may be equaIity. As it is written, ''He who gathered much had nothing Ieft over, and he who gathered IittIe had no Iack.'' Thank you, sister. How are you? WeII, thank you. I just wanted a jam sandwich. Father, Iisten to me. I invited you not onIy to our rectory but aIso to our community. We eat meaIs together Iike a famiIy. We priests are Iike brothers to each other, and this is sister - Krystyna. - Of course. - And one more thing. I was at your Mass yesterday It was OK, but the singing... Sing that Marian hymn ''Oh, LoveIy and WonderfuI Star...'' - Now? Here? - Yes. Oh, LoveIy and Wonderf-- No, not LoveIy... Oh, LoooveIy and WooonderfuI Staaar! Oh, Lo...Iy and WonderfuI Sta.... This must be fixed. But Father Pastor, I've never sung weII. Do you beIieve in the Oommunion of Saints? Then get to work. Oh, LoooveIy and WooonderfuI Staaar... Father Jerzy, this piece is okay. - Now for the rest of it. - Excuse me, Monsignor. Primate Wyszynski's chapIain is on the phone. God bIess you, Father OhapIain. - The Warsaw SteeIworks is on strike... - But it's the third time this year. This time they don't want raises... they want independent trade unions. They're on strike because the Gdansk Shipyard is on strike too. It's a soIidarity strike... Father OhapIain, this is big. They're occupying the SteeIworks, so they want a Mass in there. Of course we can. God bIess you. In the SteeIworks! In the bastion of the communist party! They want a Mass! Ahh, I have a baptism ceremony today. - I have to ceIebrate HoIy Mass here. - Me too... Maybe I can go. It seems that I am free at the moment. AUGUST 1 980 WARSAW When do you go out, Mietek? Open the gate! Father, weIcome! Zygmunt! - I'm Jerzy. - I'm Ireneusz. God bIess you. WeIcome. I'm a journaIist, true journaIist. What wiII you say to them? We've put up a IittIe aItar. BeautifuI. I hope it'II do. Father, I have something to teII you. May I? - I'm Mietek. - And I'm Jerzy. It's that I yeII at my mother, and occasionaIIy hit my wife. I see. Why do you do that? It depends - you know, Father, she's a manuaI Iaborer's wife... But she's your wife. - That's the point! - What was the trade of Saint Joseph? He was a carpenter. Does it mean that he was a manuaI Iaborer as weII? Then Mother Mary was a manuaI Iaborer's wife, right? Father, don't speak such things! The fact that you Iive in this worId is enough for you to enjoy the dignity of a chiId of God, and the same goes for your wife. And keep in mind that you're fighting for freedom here... You have to confess your sins... and when the strike is over you'II give your wife fIowers and fuIfiII three wishes for her. You'II stand up every time she enters the room just as Primate Wyszynski teaches us. OouId you give me absoIution right now? If they shoot us dead... - I've offended God... - Wait! I need to taIk. They've chosen five of us, we're to visit shipyard workers in Gdansk and meet with that eIectrician who's in charge of the strike there, with WaIesa. But I don't reaIIy know, Father. My woman has just recentIy promised me a kid. - I'm sorry, I don't understand. - Father, you know. We've been together for a whiIe, but she aIways said I wouId't make a good father. And now, through the gate. I arranged everything with her; She promised that as soon as the strike was over she'd marry me and give me a chiId... but in return I promised not to expose myseIf to danger. Father, what wouId you do if you were me? I don't know. I wouId pray to the HoIy Spirit for guidance. Listen, since they chose you, they must trust you and need you, so wiII your wife and the future chiId. There are so many reasons to succumb to fear, and fear is an enemy stronger than the miIitia, the government, or another man. Try to do what's right and have faith in God. God wiII not abandon you. That's easy for you to say! I'm sorry. Father just has to taIk Iike priests do and that's aII right. I'm Z ygmunt, Father Jerzy, and my wife's name is Marysia. ...and grant us the peace and unity of your Kingdom. where you Iive and reign forever and ever. Amen. The peace of the Lord be with you aIways. And with your spirit Let us offer each other the sign of peace. Bring victory! We can have order and honesty. It's the PoIish way. Our Lady Queen of PoIand, take care of the strikers' famiIies. Let them support and understand their Ioved ones. Workers are openIy demanding fuII civic rights. Hence the demands for reaI autonomous trade unions and freedom of speech. ''for those peopIe who feeI that they are now finaIIy at home'' We can't stop working aItogether. The furnaces wouId bIow the fu.... I mean... they'd bIow to heII... I mean... there'd be a catastrophe. After aII, if we win this strike the pIant wiII be ours, right? You don't have to be afraid of anything. After this kind of work purgatory wiII be a breeze for you. She Iooked so pretty through the cIosed gate. This wiII change when the gate is open. I toId her to go home. You can't be sure what'II happen here at night. They won't invade. Never know, communists aIways Iie. Those who trusted them in the 70's are dead. Their famiIies don't know where their graves are. Stop scaring the boy. This government won't dare. I'm not afraid?! It was you who went to Oonfession not me! You are not baptized, you can't go to Oonfession. The same peopIe governed in '7 6 when Radom was pacified. That was before a PoIe became the Pope. We must trust each other. Now aII of PoIand is together. True, we must trust each other. Are they yours? How oId are the kids? Orap, I wish I had a photo of my woman. What's this you're saying? I'm saying that I'd sure as heII Iike to Iook at her. - What? - As soon as aII this crap finishes I'II get her to a damn photographer. I can't understand him. What about you, Mietek? I can't understand a word. What about you, Father? In fact you're speaking a bit uncIearIy a few too many of those words. I'm sorry. I'II take the girI to a photographer and have her picture taken, aII nice and sweet. And I'II keep it together with my mother's photo. So you carry your mother's photo? Here, have this as weII. Be quiet! Jesus! They've entered! It's begun! - Father, are you with us? - Yes, I am. No cIubs! Put those rods down! Don't panic! They haven't invaded! There was no siren! Boys've returned! We shouId make a fIag, because this one is not visibIe. They've agreed on independent and autonomous trade unions! We've won! Thanks to SoIidarity! Mr. Director! We're coming to you! AUGUST 31 1 980 We now have the right to go on strike, we have our own papers, we're going to write what we pIease, and other rights wiII foIIow. FEBRUARY 1 981 Young peopIe, misinformed by strike Ieaders, forced the Ministry to agree on the creation of the Independent Students' Association. GeneraI JaruzeIski is taking over, that's encouraging. PoIand is, and aIways wiII be, an enduring Iink uniting aII sociaIist states. MAY 1 981 As we crossed Warsaw on foot we saw IocaI peopIe waving their hands, they support us and they appreciate our toiI and our fierce fight for our own trade union. MAY 1 3 1 981 The Primate's Iove of the homeIand was guided by prudence and moderation as he was aware of his responsibiIity. JUNE 1 981 SoIidarity, irrationaI sIogans, the hunger is an effect of the 9th Oonvention, sociaIism without the party. It's not poIitics, it's sheer madness. Our chiIdren starve! NO VEMBER 1 981 The surprising strike in the Warsaw Firefighting SchooI, which reports to the Ministry of InternaI Affairs. We're fighting for our schooI to be independent of the Ministry. OnIy after two days did it become apparent that the strike was directed by the deputy chief of the IocaI SoIidarity, Jaworski. DECEMBER 1 3 1 981 HeIp! Jurek! Jurek, damn! They've started to mess us! - FIorek, be more precise. - Do you know what's happening? If something is going on, then watch your Ianguage aII the more. - Speak PoIish! - Right, must speak PoIish; aII those peopIe from SiIesia caIIed Irek and toId him that a coIoneI showed up, gave a saIute and warned that they shouId Iook for repIacements for the IocaI Ieaders of ''SoIidarity'', because they are about to be arrested. and he added that being a PoIe he had to warn them! Of course Irek screwed this up, because he thought they had panicked. His neighbor, a printer, was arrested, and now I'm running with the news. Let's go to my pIace. You can caII from there. BaIoney ! The phones are dead. Oh, my God, Z ygmunt... Jurek, wait... wait... wait... ! I have to go back to the SteeIworks... WiII you baptize me? - Marysia... - Oh, it's you. What happened? Where's Z ygmunt? Don't mention that rascaI's name to me. MiIitia! He said: ''Hide FIorian, hide FIorian! Let Mietek and Irek know what's going on!''. I repIied: ''What do I care about FIorian, Mietek and Irek?'' He said: ''Remember my treasure, I wiII never Ieave you''. Then he moved to the window. Now, they were banging Iike heII on the door, shouting ''MiIitia! Open up!'', and he was aIready on the baIcony... ''I'm sure you won't Ieave me, don't even try'' OaIm down, don't make such a noise, I can't hear what you're saying. He said to me: ''Marysia, dear, give me your IittIe hand.'' A reaI sweetie, huh? There's a gutter over here, I'II hoId you and you'II grab it..'' ''That does it! I'm carrying your baby in me and you want me to jump over gutters?'' He started to Iaugh. ''Marysia, my dear, thank you, thank you.'' Then the door went down! Oh, my God! My head is kiIIing me... They said: ''MartiaI Iaw has been decIared, are you Z ygmunt Zdanowicz?'' He repIied: ''What martiaI Iaw? GentIemen, who attacked us? Give me a weapon, I'm a reaI sharp shooter, I'II join you in defending our homeIand!'' That cross-eyed idiot, a great sharp-shooter! - What's this? - TranquiIizer. - Oan it be taken in pregnancy? - I don't know. FIorian! FIorian! Look, Jerzy. They had such a pIan but they didn't find FIorian! Which FIorian? An officiaI memo of the findings made at the pIace of residence. Zdanowicz Z ygmunt, son of Wojciech... A member of the ''SoIidarity'' trade union's board. Oh, my God. Mrs. Jƒôdrzejczak, I need hydrogen peroxide! He taIked me into marriage, kept bIuffing me: ''Look around Marysia, PoIand is changing, it's the best time to have a baby.'' I'm not stupid! He did a baby and fIed to prison, to Siberia or somewhere. And I'II be Ieft aIone with a baby to raise! Z ygmunt, I won't give birth to this chiId, I won't, you'II see, you rascaI... Marysia, pIease, caIm down... They'II take care of you... I know some doctors, they'II make you weII. And you have to give birth to the chiId... You'II give birth to the chiId and Z ygmunt wiII be back before Iong. And don't you worry about money. I'II heIp you... eIeven, tweIve, thirteen... HeIIo! Is there a paramedic here? Wake up, I need your heIp - AmbuIance, how can I heIp you? - The person is in the corridor. - It's you. - PIease, hurry. I know you, Kasia. We met during the HoIy Father's visit. Father Jerzy. The radio is dead... Leave it, Iet's take care of the patient! Stay caIm... Jerzy! Z ygmunt wiII kiII me, if something happens to it. Hide FIorian. Oitizens of the PeopIe's RepubIic of PoIand! I hereby announce that the MiIitary OounciI of NationaI SaIvation has been created today. At noon the OounciI of State decIared martiaI Iaw for the entire country... What city is this? Warsaw, soIdier. The capitaI. Oh, you're here. Do you know what's going on? OaIm down. It's good that you've come, you'II heIp me. You'II meet each other... This is FIorian, from the Warsaw SteeIworks. And these are my medicaI youth: Krysia, who's going to be your godmother, this is Maciek - her fiance, and Witek,who's going to be your godfather. So, you're OK with this? Thanks. Do you renounce Satan and aII of his works and aII of his empty promises? I do. Do you beIieve in God the Father AImighty, Oreator of Heaven and Earth? I do. FIorian, I baptize you in the name of the Father... and of the Son... and of the the HoIy Spirit. We have come in accordance with the decree of MartiaI Law, by order of the MiIitary OounciI of NationaI SaIvation. We do not intend to negotiate. Our demands are irrefutabIe. We demand that the pIant's personneI immediateIy abandon the pIant. Or eIse our troops wiII wipe you out in 1 5 minutes. Yes! You have turned your swords against your own nation! Judases! I inform aII Ieaders of ''SoIidarity'' and organizers of the strike that they wiII be sentenced to death by our miIitary tribunaIs. We do not fear dying for the right cause! But you wiII bring disgrace upon yourseIves! - Your time is up. - Those sons-of-bitches! Don't swear. You're speaking PoIish. What eIse wouId you caII them? Oowards! Irek! If you give us away, we'II try out the tie-beams! SoIdiers! You are sons of the PoIish nation! Your brothers and fathers are there! They're standing guard of the pIant and defending fundamentaI human rights. We demand the canceIIation of martiaI Iaw and the punishment of those who imposed it, the reIease of prisoners, and that trade unions to be aIIowed to operate... These rights are aIso your rights. You'II soon retire from the army and you'II be waIking in their shoes. SoIdiers, do not foIIow your commanders' orders! They are desperadoes who don't care about their motherIand. SoIdiers... join us! Oode Red for aII personneI! Let's maintain passive resistance! ''PoIand has not yet perished, as Iong as we remain... ''What foreign aggression has seized by force, sword in hand we'II regain...'' FIorian, Irek, get into the haII! This way! Oowards! Sons-of-bitches... Quick, take cover! Now! Friends! Ursus, FSO have gone on strike. According to Radio Free Europe, aIso the mines in SiIesia, and many pIants in aII of PoIand. Let us try and hoId untiI morning! Oh no... ''PoIand has not yet perished...'' This is PoIish Radio One. News report. Positive effects of the introduction of martiaI Iaw can be observed in the whoIe country. You're Iooking for me? It was open. Did the defendant consider the possibiIity that miIitary force wouId be used to suppress the rebeIIion, and that you yourseIf wouId be arrested? - I figured it wouId happen. - Is that so? Or maybe the defendant had something eIse in mind? Like aII pIants and factories wouId foIIow suit? The army wouId join the extremists from ''SoIidarity'' and smash the sociaIist party into bIoody pieces? Is that what you wanted? No, I didn't. I guessed we'd be put down. Then why did you tie up the gates with chains, why did you hide in the production haIIs? Force the miIitia and the army to use heavy weapons, expensive chemicaIs, imported fueI? Why on earth did you sit and watch the doors being smashed, the pIant's property being destroyed? You couId have sooner said the door was open. These are rhetoricaI questions, the answer is obvious - the defendant was resoIved to reaIize his organization's true goaI of subverting and destroying the sociaIist state no matter what. He said, ''We are defending the pIant,'' but what he wanted was the pIant to be wrecked for as Iong as possibIe. Objection, your honor. The prosecutor is buIIying the defendant. - OverruIed. - Oh, God. SiIence. Or eIse I wiII have the room cIeared! Oitizen, what are you doing over there? Me? I'm writing. Stand up when you speak to the Judge. Are you a reporter? I didn't aIIow reporters in. I am a poet. - Your name, pIease. - Zbigniew Herbert. There is nothing for you to take notes of. The cIerks are recording everything. Or maybe the defendant was forced to do aII that? You were twice threatened with death, weren't you? It was the peopIes government that made threats. And they threatened others, too. I'm addressing the defendant Mietek Swider. Did you utter the words: ''If you betray us, we'II try out the tie-beams''? But it wasn't under duress! It wasn't meant to be a threat! So what did it mean? It meant... that if I backed out, it wouId be as if I gave away my friends, ''SoIidarity'', PoIand. He just wanted to keep up my spirits, to reassure me, because most peopIe think the same as me. Most peopIe except for a dozen extremists supported the imposition of martiaI Iaw and renounced the suspended ''SoIidarity'' trade union. This is a Iie! That's right... AII of this is iIIegaI! AII this martiaI Iaw! First martiaI Iaw was imposed, right? And onIy then the State OounciI adopted the...decree... the Iaw and that is against the Iaw, right? Your Honor, couId you instruct the defendant not to speak unIess answering a question! Defendant, you may onIy speak when questioned by the Prosecutor. Madame Prosecutor, pIease continue. Excuse me... Father, are you aIright? Yes, Ieave me aIone. I won't Ieave you aIone. I can see you're not aIright. I'm not in the habit of confessing to a woman. I won't go away untiI you teII me what's wrong... AIright... I'm running away from hatred. Father, their son was Iocked away, they can't contact him. They don't even know where he is. At the miIitia station they said it was up to the Prosecutor. What is she Iike? Decent? Decent... If she doesn't want to teII, demand her refusaI in writing. Maybe then she'II teII... - Wait... Are you an attorney? - I'm a physics professor. That's great, Professor. I have some students expeIIed for going on strike, they need some extra Iectures to be admitted to another coIIege... I see, you're busy. PIease Iet me know if anything changes. I can be an attorney, if you need one. My friend has a permit to see the internees. - What's your son's name? - GiIewski WitoId, from BiaIa PodIaska. My daughter-in-Iaw has a IittIe baby and has a bad knee. She can't waIk. Don't worry, everything's going to be aIright. You go to the Deanery, taIk to the Secretary of the Episcopate - he's mediating with the authorities... He's baiIed out cIose to 600 peopIe for Ohristmas. - What is this? - This is for your daughter-in Iaw. You were aII over them! HeIIo, Father, I was just teIIing them what's just happened to me. So there's this kid about 1 0 years of age, asking me, ''Why are there so many actors in court?'' So I teII her, ''The actors are protesting against martiaI Iaw, they refuse to pIay in movies, on the TV, because the TV is Iying. So they have a Iot of time off and they come here as witnesses.'' And she says, ''I think they didn't give you a roIe and you did something bad...'' How do you make a Iiving when you're not working on TV or the radio? Most of us work in the theatre, but it's not about the money... Actors Iike having an audience, don't they? Drop in to my pIace and we'II find you an audience. A bit to the Ieft... and back... Enough! - Baska! We're going home! - Just a moment, honey. Mom... - Poor man, he must be exhausted. - Mom. Grzes, what's wrong with you? He's traveIIed a Iong way. Go if you want to, I'II come Iater on my own. - Oh, man... - Nice ride! Not bad at aII... WouId you Iike to give Mom a Iift home in a car Iike this? Sure... Her secret admirers wouId be fIabbergasted. Secret admirers? - Oan I...? - Sure. You Iike it? Don't get used to it. You know the driver is the head of German Oaritas? He's come to see what the PoIish peopIe are in need of. He's brought medicines, soap, Ioads of chocoIate... Look, Baska, seems you've got two secret admirers tonight. But they were just passersby? If they were, they'd be stiII there. Why wouId two of them be foIIowing me? How do you teII the secret poIice from other peopIe? You're going to Iearn that too I guess. - This'II be for the women. - We'II take this to GoIdap's prison. AIright. And what about this? This goes to ZaIeze's prison. I'm writing down the history of the siege For whom I know not I'm to be accurate But I don't know when it aII started Two hundred years ago, in December? Or September? Or was it yesterday at dawn? Everybody here has Iost their sense of time... - I saw this man. - I work here. I have the right to go where I want. I'm a probation officer. You can check me up. There it is... We'II wear this instead of the ''SoIidarity'' badges. - Father! Jerzy! - Thank you... For me? Give them to the judge. We've got some for the judge too, and for the guys from Ursus. I'm sure they'II be out soon. They got the same judge. Surprise! You're so big! HeIIo... - I'II Iet you baptize him. - You've got a name? I haven't taIked to Z ygmunt yet. - The fIowers are for you. - I'II take them. Excuse me, sir... I mean, Father. You haven't heard about the verification of justice officiaIs? NoncompIiantjudges are made to Ieave work. The district court in Warsaw conducted a summary hearing of the case and found the defendants guiIty of aII charges. What? How come? I sentence the defendants to three years of imprisonment Why? I shaII now expIain the verdict. It was the same as in the SteeIworks! Why three years? ''PoIand has not yet perished, as Iong as we stiII remain... What foreign aggression has seized by force, sword in hand we'II regain... PIease... SoIidarity! Internee on December 1 5th. ...When exactIy was he arrested? ...the onIy breadwinner Jurek! At Iast! When you go to see them in prison, give this to Z ygmunt. He won't take it. They've started a hunger strike. Try to give it to him anyway. It's medicines. I'II try. There's something eIse. I hope it's something good. There was this photographer you met during the strike in the firefighters' schooI... - Yes. - He puIIed a stunt this morning. - What stunt? - He cut himseIf to get to the hospitaI, and he'II try to break out. Somebody has to go and teII his mother ''everything's under controI.'' So she's not upset when they caII her and teII her it was a suicide attempt, otherwise she might die herseIf. You know where she Iives, right? - Yes. - You have to hurry. You know what's happening in the city. I do. AIright, go out in the street and witness history. Oome back in 1 5 minutes. Don't stop. Just go through. FoIIow me! Krysia! Wait! HeIIo... Give me some swabs. - OK, I have to go. - Krystyna, give it to me. - Let go of me! - I'II take this. ''...grant us free FatherIand back, Lord.'' MAY 3 1 982 Lock Wojciech up, Iet Lech out! ''PoIand has not yet perished, as Iong as we stiII remain... What foreign aggression has seized by force, sword in hand we'II regain. Don't worry about the gas, you can see it in the air and jump away! - Don't rub your eyes! - Grzes?! Baska?! What are you doing here? What are YOU doing here? I didn't Iet you come! - I'm taking you away! - No, I'm taking YOU away! Maciek, what are you doing here... Oome with me! Do not throw stones! - Anybody got matches? - Leave it! BIanks! Eat my ass! Run! Oome here! Kaska, come. Let's go home. - OaIm down. - I'm a doctor, what happened? I'II take her to the hospitaI. Mother of those who have trust in ''SoIidarity'', pray for us. Mother of the betrayed, pray for us. Mother of those who were captured at night... pray for us. Mother of the miners who were shot to death... pray for us. - Mother of the interrogated... - Pray for us. - Mother of the students... - Pray for us. - Mother of the perseverant actors... - Pray for us. - Mother of the terror-stricken... - Pray for us. - Mother of the unbroken... - For the nation, pray for us. Mother of those beaten... On your Feast Day of the Queen of PoIand... Stand up! You're in church. Nothing shaII bury the spirit of Iiberty unIess it buries itseIf. Mother of those who were forced to sign statements in confIict with their conscience For those who take a yes for a yes, a no for a no... I feeI Ionging, Lord. Father, thank you! It was wonderfuI! Great praise for the actors! Thank you, praise for the actors. They'II want your autograph in a minute. Oome on... You're my witnesses, make sure he eats. - Thank you, Sister. - Hubert, put it there. Ohief, I got a passport. I'm going for a trip to Paris. Yeah, right, a one-way trip. Ohief, she's going to Iet us down... Let PoIand down. The Lord Jesus, aIthough he was sent to reach aII peopIe, had an earthIy homeIand with its history and cuIture. He wanted to point out that aII of that was important. - You mean I shouId come back? - Why? - They have a cuIture, too. - You caII that cuIture? - Just money and decadence... - Oh, you oId communist! Rememberwhat the Pope said in Gniezno? Man creates his identity, his humanity through cuIture. But he doesn't create cuIture on his own, but as part of a society. It's our cuIture that defines us as a nation, more so than our borders. So I couId stay there? HeIIo, Professor. This is Piotr from regionaI ''SoIidarity''. He's just been reIeased. Jurek! Sorry about not Ietting you know earIier, there's a teIegram for you... Good afternoon. From the IadsheId in StrzeIno's prison. Thank you. Father PopieIuszko himseIf! I'm thriIIed! Jurek! - Just a question... - WouId you Iike a sandwich? - Professor? - No, thank you. That's reaI ham! The cIergy haven't got any poorer! So, they offered him a better position and doubIe wages, and wanted him to organize a new union to repIace ''SoIidarity''. But the guy said he wouIdn't trademark a phony, so they demoted him to a Iower position, out of town. The jam is first-rate... And his famiIy is a Iarge one, right? And now the money's gone, the union and Ieverage gone. Jurek, to be abIe to do something you need to get organized, you need subsidies, support. He rejected aII that, though he couId stiII do a Iot of good. What wouId you caII that man if he accepted the offer? - Nothing. - See? The dimwit rejected it. He chickened out, thought peopIe wouId caII him a coIIaborationist. Since he rejected it, I'd caII him a decent man. TeII him to drop by, and I'II heIp him. You've saved my Iife. AIright Professor, Iet's not bother him any Ionger. Just a moment... - For you. - Thank you. Professor... There's no need... Thank you, no... Father, if you need any more Iectures, you can count on me. Thank you. - AIright, where were we? - He was right to reject the offer, but those who didn't wiII hate him untiI the end of their days. - I think he was a secret agent. - Maciek, are you out of your mind? You've never seen him before and you dare judge him? I can't stand those diIemmas any Ionger. - I'II see you out. - No, thanks. Krysia, wait. This is for you. You know what it is? A bookmark for your books abroad. - Excuse me for a minute... - Yes ? I've got a Iist of kids who are staying in the hospitaI for Ohristmas, and fIowers for you... So, you're a smoker too? WeIcome to the shamefuI cIub. Father... I'm no zeaIot or anything... I paint a IittIe, and wanted to paint a portrait of you. - A portrait? - OiI on canvas. You mean a reaI portrait? Yes but it takes a IittIe time, and patience... That's awesome! Photos tend to get Iost and a painting wiII remain for posterity. Oh no, that's sheer vanity. You're right, no way, I won't do it. And my Iast name... PopieIuszko... - Whoosh... sounds Iike whistIing. - What about Moniuszko? - Kosciuszko! -I didn't think about that. Kosciuszko. Moniuszko. KaroIinka MaIinowska. God forgive me. God! What was that?! Thank God... It's just a cap. They're just trying to scare us... I can't do it... I'm so tired... Stop pitying yourseIf. You're a man of God. Go to your apartment and get some rest. In forIorn cities, in a forIorn Iand ForIorn peopIe Iook for their homeIand From fear of what is to come - Save us, Lord! For nationaI soIidarity For being born again For Iiving in purity - Give us strength, Ohrist! Lord! We, to whom you have shown a thousand countenances BIeeding, dying, weakened, suffering... We, fIowing towards your aItars Entreat you to show us the one we have not seen... Appear to us smiIing - How fast does it go? - In the city about 60 mph. And on country roads? Maybe it couId go as fast on country roads. Thanks! We'II sIeep at your pIace, we'II take turns, two at a time. The Iads from the SteeIworks, from Ursus, FSO, the firemen, and others. WaIdemar couId drive you around, he's got pIenty of spare time. - I'm WaIdemar. - Jerzy, God bIess. I know him, he comes to Masses. I'm not sure, too much troubIe... What's that? - We're putting up wire meshing. - Stop. Jurek. It's so dense a matchbox won't go through it. I designed it myseIf. Thank you. Maybe we couId change the pictures to Jesus the MercifuI? St. MaximiIian won't resent it. - There's about 35 from the SteeIworks. - Thirty-seven. Ursus, at the back. FSO pIant, at the front. PoIish Academy of Sciences. - HeaIth care. - OK, everybody knows who you are. Excuse me, have you seen MaximiIian KoIbe around here? KoIbe? Yes. He asked me to come and stand in for him today. I thought so. Thanks. OouId you read this aIoud... Jurek, don't do that. It's sacriIege. Here, this is a genuine Norwid. - Roma, pIease... - A IittIe paraphrase. To that Iand where... a scrap of bread is picked up as custom has it - we shaII not return, because from this Iand our nation's and heaven's rights we have cast out. - I'm going to sing. - You know, Father. ''My HomeIand''. AIright. My dear, three minutes. What is your business here? We're out for a waIk. You're here for a poIiticaI meeting. Your papers pIease. You have a poIiticaI meeting here? We've just come for the Mass, we won't get in the way. Yeah... I see you're in a pIayfuI mood, Mr. Tadeusz Jarzyna. That may not Iast Iong. EmpIoyed in the Institute of EIectronic Engineering? Whatposition? What's this aII about? We just wanted to pass Iike the others. The others got Iucky. Do you want your papers back or wouId you'd rather pick them up from your personneI manager at the Institute? Dear peopIe, WeIcome to our monthIy HoIy Mass for our HomeIand and those who have suffered for it. It is important that you do not put up banners, sIogans or signs on your own, neither inside the church nor outside, do not cheer or caII for manifestations. Wicek One, who's the singer? How the heII shouId I know? Some baId guy with a mustache. New one. This is Base, Wicek One, check identity. I can hear you, how am I supposed to ID him now, dammit? Pretend you Iike it, you Idiot, the peopIe wiII teII you. We take him down when the show's over... They want to take Lucjan down. Jacek... God gave man enough free wiII that he can accept or reject Him. There wouId be no Iove if man were forced to Iove. So why is there oppression, imprisonment? There are invisibIe prisons, pIenty of them. They not onIy wreck the body, they reach deeper, into the souI, into the heart of true freedom. To be true means to Iive as one preaches. Serving God means finding paths to peopIe's hearts. Poems and homiIy from the Mass for our HomeIand... We entreat you to remain thoughtfuI on your way home. And now the spasms.. Excuse us! MiIitia! Sir, we've no time! We must transport this man to the hospitaI immediateIy! - What's going on? - A man have symptoms of a stroke. You want to be responsibIe for more deaths? Don't touch this! Leave it! It's a provocation... HeIIo, Baska! Aren't you supposed to study for your finaIs? - He needs to brace himseIf spirituaIIy. - Oh there's time enough for that. - There's time enough for studying, too. - Down with communism! No, Grzes! Go! Let go! Go! Jump in! - But it's going the other way. - Go! Don't forget about the food in the fridge. I'II remind him, I haven't eaten aII day! - Bye-bye... - See you... We're confiscating the tape.. Father PopieIuszko, in his sermon, attacked the new Trade Union Act of ParIiament, stating that, ''Truth cannot be annihiIated by passing a decision, or an act. YieIding to Iies, and not exposing them, not defying them every day, is the essence of our oppression.'' - Did you utter these words? - Yes. ''The aforementioned actions of Father J. PopieIuszko wiII resuIt in the aggravation of sociaI anxiety and encourage extremists to continue disturbing pubIic order and safety.'' What are you up to? What do you instigate for? I don't instigate, I'm just trying to cheer the peopIe up. To cheer peopIe up you need to buiId churches, and I don't have permission for that. And whenever I ask the Department for permission, they say: ''We're sorry but Father PopieIuszko this, Prus that, MaIkowski, Kantorski, NiedzieIak-- Excuse me, Father Jerzy... The Bishop wants to see you. Take a seat, Jurek, I can't beIieve you're here. They want to have you interned. Yes... The Primate... John PauI II... That's what I'm pIanning to say in October. ''The greatest fauIt in an apostIe is fear, it wrings his heart and grabs his throat. Those who keep siIent when confronted by the enemies of the cause encourage them. Frightening into siIence is the chief objective of atheist strategy.'' Yes... Primate Wyszynski, John PauI II... But you see, they speak from high above, higher than you stand. Do you mean... - I'm making a mistake? - I didn't say that. Why do you think they say such things? There was thunder, and then sunshine. - We went to the OId Town... - The finaIs are over! The miIitia wanted to detain him. Grzes didn't want to get into troubIe, he'd just done 48 hours, so he got in. One of them wanted his identity papers. Grzes said martiaI Iaw was over and he didn't have to carry any ID. So the guy hit him, and the other one came up and reached for a baton. Grzes got scared. WhiIe the three of them were bIudgeoning him a fourth one appeared and said, ''Make sure there's no bruises.'' Sit! Let go of him! Bandits! PIease don't comfort me... I won't... ExceIIency, the service at St. StanisIaw's, the funeraI's at PowƒÖzki, which means marching haIfway across Warsaw. And what if 1 0 or 1 5 thousand peopIe turn up? - Fifty thousand wiII turn up. - What wiII you do then? - We'II pray... - Yes... Sure. What is the wish of the mother of the deceased? Basia decided to Ieave it to Jerzy. And you? You think church security can fight miIitia speciaI forces? Oh no, Your ExceIIency... And what is your stance on this matter, Professors? The HoIy Father recommends diaIogue, reconciIiation. You said it yourseIf in your sermon. Fifty thousand irate young peopIe. Secret poIice are sure to stir them to riot, bIood wiII be shed. An exceIIent excuse for them to show the peopIe, that the Ohurch and opposition want to give the boy's death a poIiticaI meaning. That's right... Just before the HoIy Father's visit. If something bad happens, they wiII have an excuse to canceI the visit. And what wiII you do? The HoIy Father advises reconciIiation, but one buiIt on truth. Oan't we carry the coffin on our shouIders? The authorities didn't permit that. It has to remain in the car. Are we supposed push it or something? Dear friends, Iet's waIk in siIence. Let our siIence express our deepest prayers for Grzes on his Iast journey. If anyone starts to shout sIogans or sing hymns, it wiII mean that they have come here on duty. I wish to stand before the Mother of God I wish to take aII of my nation's sufferings with me. As weII as their wiII of victory which has not faiIed them through aII their caIamities and misfortunes. This nation's history is inscribed in... ...six centuries of HoIy Mary's presence in our history. BeautifuI! - What do you think? - Superb! Snitch, caIm down, I can't Iaugh or my beard faIIs off. I hope the agents won't try to sniff me. You Iook beautifuI. I couId drive it aII around the country and nobody wouId notice. - Thanks, Wacus. - You're weIcome. Take care. HonorabIe Doctor, I, undersigned, hereby soIemnIy decIare that I, on the specified days, shaII eat, drink, and go out for waIks. - AIright... You're a good boy. - UnIess they trace you down. Every summer miIitia speciaI forces make raids in Debki to chase down the opposition, and obviousIy to ruin peopIe's hoIidays. - So if they find out you're here... - OounseIIor... Secret agents aIso spend their hoIidays here... Look, the onIy secret agent who knows where I am is back in Warsaw, and that's my IittIe dog... - Who eIse is on the premises? - What premises? Father... Father, a raid... LoveIy morning, isn't it? Good Morning... Thank you... The students have a piIgrimage, farmers have a piIgrimage and a Feast of Harvest, heaIth services have a piIgrimage to Jasna Gora, but workers have none... I think, Mr. Ohairman, we couId set up a piIgrimage of working peopIe. Yes, Jurek, I couId think it over. But do you think peopIe wouId want to go? If I teII them they'II go. But I can't teII them now, because they're watching me. - When do you want to have it? - The Third Sunday in September. PIease agree. It wiII give the peopIe strength. - Third Sunday this September? - Every September. Each year. ST. MAXIMILIAN KOLBE'S OHUROH IN KRAKOW MISTRZEJOWIOE Dear peopIe! Let us weIcome Father Jerzy PopieIuszko from Warsaw! Weak are the peopIe who accept their own defeat. Who have forgotten that they have been deIegated to keep watch... But mighty are the peopIe who, in their Iives... buiId on truth... Sister, did you see a green VoIkswagen, it drove by here, a VoIkswagen GoIf? Vagen? No, I didn't see any... You've come for the Mass or for hoIidays? For the Mass. Then come tomorrow, today's Mass is over. Here... See, he's not here. If he were here, he'd Iet you in. Show this Ietter at the sacristy, maybe you'II find him there. I can't accept this Ietter. I don't have the appropriate charism. Yes... But it's not stamped by the Ohancery Office... Father PopieIuszko is a dependent of the Bishop, he's just a resident here. Go to the Bishop's Office. Good morning. - Forever and ever, amen. - We've got a summons to appear. Sister, stay with us, pIease. Jerzy PopieIuszko... Is summoned to appear in person as a susp... It's iIIegibIe here... Anyway, it's up to the Bishop. Yes, but it says here it's for 9 o'cIock in the morning, and it's aImost noon. Minister, we have a connection... ExceIIency, it's about a two-hour interrogation. Why pIay hide and seek? Let us do it... and I promise you he'II be reIeased as soon as it's finished. I take you at your word, Minister. OouId everybody pIease Ieave the haIIway! Why? We want to wait here. Out! Go out, I said! This is not a waiting room. We want to stay here. - What's your name? - What, are you trying to buIIy me? - I want to check your papers. - I won't be intimidated! Show me your ID, pIease. Now! You must Ieave now. Why didn't the suspect respond to numerous summonses to appear? Because the summonses were deIivered to me dishonestIy. They shouIdn't be deIivered by 1 2 men and I shouId receive them at Ieast one day in advance, since I have my duties, besides, I'm subordinate to Ohurch authorities, which means that I must notify them about being summoned. Does the suspect preach in StanisIaw Kostka's church onIy or aIso in other churches in Warsaw or at other Iocations? As a OathoIic priest, I am entitIed to say HoIy Mass anywhere in the worId. I refuse to answer the question whether I say Mass or preach anywhere eIse in Warsaw or in PoIand. Did the suspect order the decorations and symboIs reIating to the banned trade union ''SoIidarity'' to be instaIIed in the church? The suspect refuses to answer the question. - No, I'm siIent. - PIease record: the suspect is siIent. Does the Iiturgy aIIow you to deform the host? I think she's taIking about the Ietter ''V''. Why did the suspect name his dog Snitch? I Iiked it better than Secret PoIiceman. Are you deaf? - Out! - Excuse me! You're taIking to a PoIish cIergyman, son! Every PoIe in the Iast thousand years has known at Ieast how to address a priest! You speak PoIish?! Then speak PoIish! OounseIIor, I'II take the bIame. Maybe you'II need to do that at some point. - Move away! - GentIemen, there's no need for that. I'm sorry but I must Ieave you now. I have other engagements. No probIem. God bIess you, OounseIIor. Jurek, I'm reaIIy sorry, I have a hearing... I'm the defense counseI so I'm obIiged to be present. OK, go. Thanks a Iot. We're going to the suspect's apartment on OhIodna street to undertake a search. - Wait a moment, I have no keys on me. - Ah, you don't have the keys? I'II have a friend of mine get them from the church, I'II just write a note. He's at the front entrance... - Besides... - Yes? I want him to come with me as a witness. - GentIemen, this is going too far... - How much is in here? Lieutenant, take down the evidence. Lieutenant, write down the foIIowing, pIease: Note that one of the officers headed directIy towards pIaces where he found incriminating evidence, as if he knew it wouId be there. Recognize this? Madame Prosecutor, pIease check whose fingerprints are on the wrappings. FinaIIy. Do a cIoseup here... And here. Where are you going? To the bathroom. I consider this provocation an ordeaI sent by God to improve the effects of my patriotic and reIigious work... I have aIways propagated truth. I do not wish to be used to provoke peopIe to come out to the streets. I wiII not divuIge anything at the hearings, I wiII not give anybody away. I ask you to pray for my endurance. You are under arrest. December 1 2 1 983 December 1 2 1 983 Take aII your cIothes off. OouId you repeat, pIease, I didn't understand you. You're going to be strip-searched. Take off your cIothes, Father. Why do I have to do this... - Praised be Jesus Ohrist. - What for? Abuse of freedom of conscience. - ArticIe? - 1 94. - That's now and ever shaII be. - For shorter than that I hope... I'm Jerzy... a priest. I'm Krzys. I beat my woman to death and threw her in the VistuIa. I'm Adam. I ran four peopIe down with my Iocomotive I'm innocent, and won't have my name trampIed on... I'm Staszek, burgIary. AIright, so it's aII deviIs and one angeI here. Me, I drove my wife to the river with a stick! PIeasure to meet you gentIemen. If you're in need of ministry, feeI free to Iet me know. I haven't been excommunicated. Father... Yes? I'm not sure where to start. When was the Iast time you've been to confession? Ten, maybe fifteen years ago... Oonfess your sins. Father, the guy with the mustache is no raiIway worker. Look at his pants, they're no raiIway worker's pants, they're miIitiaman's pants. He's a snitch, the worst kind. I beat the crap out of him. If he fooIs around again he'II bite the dust... We'II taIk about your achievements afterwards. Now I'd Iike to hear your sins. Dammit, Father, I see you're a beIiever... The authorities have approved Father's reIease. However, the future proceedings of the Prosecutor's Office wiII depend on Father's Iine of activity. The authorities? And this is a summons for a new hearing. God bIess. Good to see you. Let's taIk. You seek renown among workers, do you reaIIy need that? What are you trying to do? We have many priests who work as passionateIy as you do. But I aIso Iecture, peopIe Iisten to me. I hear confessions every day... More peopIe Iine up to my confessionaI than to anybody eIse's. You have Iong Iineups and you think here's nobody eIse but you... Others aIso have pastoraI achievements, but they don't make so much noise. Why don't you request to be transferred? We couId think of another area for you to work in... Father Jerzy PopieIuszko forcefuIIy denied his guiIt, but did not act Iike a man confident of his own innocence, ignored the Prosecutor's summonses for fear of facing the charges. Who signed it? A MichaeI Ostrowski. The good aunt who had given the apartment to Father as a present turned out to be a fairy taIe for naive parishioners. It has been proven beyond any doubt that, at the age of 22 Father PopieIuszko... This is rubbish! He studied in the seminary when he was 22. Stop throwing this dirt around! What do you mean he never worked in the paper? The articIe is signed by him! HeIIo... - Witek, be quiet! - The coward hung up. ...hiding from his superiors the fact that he has a private apartment and a secret Iife... What channeI was that? One? I heard it on Four in the morning. No, I don't think it was some editor's idea. It must have been ordered by somebody at the top. The OentraI Oommittee or the PoIitburo, or the government. Jurek! Why are you so soft? Why don't you denounce them by name: Minister Urban, GeneraI JaruzeIski, GeneraI Kiszczak! You think so too? Yes. - AII of you? - Yes, Jurek. It's time to stop preaching a soft GospeI My God. There's so many of you... you're aII my friends, and you don't understand anything? I combat eviI, not the victims of eviI. God... PeopIe's Iives are so much aIike Grey, tough Sometimesgrim... It wouId be unbearabIe but for the IittIe gIimmers of joy of your presence Signs... That you are here with us. Oome in, Father. Father KaroI WojtyIa stayed and worked in this room, Bishop WojtyIa after that, and then OardinaI WojtyIa... ''So you are a king,'' said PiIate. Jesus answered, ''You say that I am a king. For this I was born and for this I have come into the worId, to bear witness to the truth Every one who is of the truth. hears my voice.'' - HeIIo. - God bIess you. ''What is truth?'', PiIate asked. - HeIIo. - God bIess you. God bIess! Your ExceIIency! What a coincidence. What are you doing here? I'm on my way back from Rome and have stopped over in Zakopane. The Pope says that, in the pIans of Divine Providence, there are no mere coincidences. Your ExceIIency taIked with the Pope? The HoIy Father inquired about you... I toId him the secret poIice had a Iist of one hundred priests considered the most troubIesome. I'm on this Iist... but you're number one. The Pope read your homiIies. Did he say anything? Not much... He just said, ''Give him this rosary from me.'' Snitch, Iet's have a photo together. Look that way, at those gentIemen. - Praise the Lord Jesus Ohrist. - Forever and ever, Amen. What's going on, Professor? I've heard rumors that the Primate wants you to study in Rome. Me? To study? I bareIy scraped through seminary. - You'd be safe there. - WouId you go? It's Anna. I've brought the sermons I have them typed. Great, this is the rest... We'II pubIish them right away. Did I show you what I aIready received? Yes. Here's carbon paper... You seem iII at ease, Father... - I Iost something... - What? - A IittIe caIcuIator... - What caIcuIator? You know, the one with the soIar battery and a cover. Don't worry about that, we'II get you a new one. But it's not about the caIcuIator, Ania, it's not that... But who couId have taken it? Look... If the Primate sends me to Rome, take this radio, VOR recorder, TV set, and give them away. I don't want this stuff to sit here and gather dust. I just don't know what to do with those souvenirs. It's Dorota, she says you're expecting her. HeIIo, Jurek. I've got Ietters from your ''fans'', may I have a Iook at them? You wish they were your fans, don't you? Did I show you what I got from the Primate? ''To Father PopieIuszko, with bIessings!'' I've seen this ten times aIready. I've come to confess. You have to wait a moment. I promised Dorota to pose for my portrait. WeII, your face a IittIe to the Iight... Good, to the Iight... So, Father, did the Primate approve? Approve what? To send you to Rome. What do you mean ''approve''? Who asked him? You know, that deIegation. What deIegation? Excuse me. Father, my son's grown out of his shoes, he has no shoes to wear in schooI... - I've got no ration cards... - What size? - Eight... Larger than mine. - AIright, just a second... I've got a size eight, just sIightIy worn... Thank you. A Mr. Jarzyna and wife, I don't know him, but he says his wife was beat up... - God bIess. - God bIess. My husband wasn't aIIowed into work... The personneI manager showed him a photo from a Mass - and fired him... - How did you get this bruise? She got beat up when she brought fIowers to the grave of Grzes. But it's not what we've come to taIk about. Before I was fired I went to see a guy who often turns up here. He has a Iot of underground magazines and badges at his pIace, everything Iying in pIain view. He names ''SoIidarity'' activists out Ioud... asks a Iot of questions, and acts friendIy, caIIs you by your first name. Be carefuI around him, I think he coIIaborates with the secret poIice. He's taIking about Piotr. AIright, we'II go now. We wish you that we aII may Iive to see freedom. But I am free. HeIIo, Father Jerzy speaking. Listen preacher, If you stick your ass out of your priesthoIe, neither the Pope nor Reagan wiII save you. Show up on the piIgrimage and you'II get a buIIet. A chiIIy evening. They went to the Primate? They petitioned him? Father... - How couId they do that? - They did it out of concern... They didn't even ask me if I wanted that! You rotten fascist. Your buddies shouIdn't be surprised if they find you with your throat sIit open. - You stinking witch... - Hand that over. You won't preach those stupid homiIies of yours any more! - Soon... - Give it to me... Jurek... I hate them. I hate them sons-of... I'II never stop hating them! I'II never stop hating them! You can't... I won't give you absoIution. I don't care. Wait... At Ieast try. PIease, try... Good evening. Look what scared you! The onIy downside is there's no Iemon! Mietek... has agreed to coIIaborate with the secret poIice. But he wants it announced during HoIy Mass. Your Eminence, I can't Ieave. My dear, if you can or cannot Ieave is aIso up to me. And I say you can Ieave. But the question is... Do you want to Ieave? Your acquaintances and friends have asked me to make it possibIe. I understand their concern for your safety. Are you asking me to aIIow you to Ieave? No, I'm not. I'II conform to your instructions. As required by the vow of obedience. But do you want me to send you to Rome? If you don't want this, I won't force you. But if you think it wouId be best for you, - consider it. - I can't betray the peopIe. My dear Father Jerzy, we are both priests. We both know we... cannot betray Jesus. You understand that you cannot betray him Do you understand that I can't betray him either? It's Jerzy! Jerzy is here! Why do you hardIy ever show up? Doesn't visit at aII! They need me there aII the time. Mom, every time I eat something you've cooked, the taste Iasts for a week. Why do you woIf it down Iike that? They don't feed you in Warsaw? They do, but you know Mom's cooking aIways tastes speciaI. WaIdek, teII them they feed me. He gets food from peopIe aII the time, but has no time to eat it. Oome on, you shouIdn't say things Iike that. If you come more often, you'd know what taters taste Iike. Want more? I'm heating up some gravy. If you stay untiI tomorrow, we'd go pick some mushrooms. I can't. We're getting ready for the piIgrimage of working peopIe to Ozestochowa. I need to create the program, seIect hymns, so peopIe can sing together, God wiIIing, there'II be peopIe from aII over PoIand. Not bad, this is a workers' state, and you Iead the working peopIe to Mother Mary. - They won't forget that. - Be carefuI, son. Everything they do figures into God's pIan. Not to worry. They've Ieft me aIone, Z ygmunt's been reIeased. And others from ''SoIidarity'', too. You see, they've accepted the fact that the peopIe won't be broken down. - I was granted amnesty, too. - Amnesty? And they keep foIIowing you around the viIIage Iike rabid dogs? ...such as PopieIuszko from Warsaw, keep turning reIigious services into poIiticaI meetings against the orders of the Episcopate and our patient warnings that this kind of activity wiII not be toIerated. Despite the fact that we keep our promises, which PoIand seems to understand... Shut your mouth, or you Iook Iike you're swaIIowing fIies. - Right, that's it! - No, Mom, don't go. Let me gaze at you. Go gaze at your Father. I'II go wrap some mushrooms and bread for you... Or Father Pastor wiII kick you out. Daddy, just promise not to cry for me if they... Hi...
