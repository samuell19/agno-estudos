- What are you saying? In Jimmy's Rockhouse? That's a joke. Yes, Sophie, the only one good girl, she is a regular guest. - Did you get a trick? - Yeah very good. Listen! I have to pass mom's room door, if I want to go outside. I will say that I must go to the toilet, it's right besides the entry. If she is there, I just went to the toilet. While sleeping, do you understand? I put clothes up on the flusher box. And i can leave without her notice. - How do you get back? - With the same trick. I must pay a lot, because my sister is blackmailing me. How is it going? - Not a single guy. Not even a Ski-Teacher! Just women. I'm coming. No, I meant Sophie. Mathieu? he is not calling. - I think that all is just a single big proof of his love. His plastered leg, Etiennes crushed car and the humor that's in there. - At least he makes you laugh! - Ah, just look at everyone! Rich, soft and rough. But one you can laugh about, you must search long. Now she is selling the perfume Plaster d'amour. Anyway we have to do something. - Should I smash her face? - Romance, with a touch of exotism fresh and good. Oh,no problem. - If you allow? - Go ahead. - Hm...very sensual! Oh God, what's up with me? - You are a clumsy one, Madame. - I'm so sorry! Do you have "Imprinte" from Courege? - This is some fine powder, transparent and causes no allergies. - Smells kinda cheap. Don't you think? Oh, please excuse. Smells kinda tarty, hm? Please wait! I'm a bit confused today. - What are you think you are doing? Stop! Stop I say! Are you demented? Stop it! Are you completely insane? I'm calling the police! HeIIo? Is this the police? - Ah, before i forget... That's yours, isn't it? - She is insane! Hysteric! Hello, Madame. Did you see that? That broad is crazy! Would you be so kind, Madame, to be awitness for me? You saw, how she destroyed my boutique! - Here they come. - Goodbye! - HeIIo, Papa! - HeIIo. You look great. - This is Sophie, my parents. - Did someone called? - Yes, Mathieu, yesterday. - Yesterday! And what did he say? Oh, mom! Mathieu called! Will we see you tomorrow? We are calling. - Your plaster is gone! - It's over. - Ah, Vic... we decided... - Excuse me, you decided. - No, we, me and you! We both think that, in the future... we need some change of air. - Are you also going to the mountains? No. Your father and I, we want a bit ... - Can I make a party for my birthday? - Listen! - Your father will live somewhere else for some time. - Where? - At a friends house. - Etienne? - No way! In that wasteland. A sheperd killed himself there, because he couldn't stand that wasteland. - I'm trying to tell it to Vic! At Antoine place. - Not for long. One month? - Two! - One or two... We will see each other at weekends. - Why? - Because I... - Because sometimes, if you love someone for a long time, it's sometimes good to get... It becomes a habit... - You want to live separate? - Yes kinda. - Only on weekends... - What is with weekends? - There are always partys on saturdays. - Are you going to get divorced? I was so excited to see him again. I just felt it in my stomach. It was just like in a movie, a slow floating, like in slowmotion. - (PeneIope) Slowmotion is often forced. Hello, here is Francois Beretton. Antoine is not at home. I'm from 1 to 2 at Betty, between 5 and 7 at Francine. About tomorrow if Angele is calling: Angele, my dear, I would like you to come to a candlelight dinner. Claudine, my dear, I'm sorry, I don't have anymore time. If it's Francoise , is it you? When can i come home again? - HeIIo? - HeIIo? Ah, it is you Poupette. - PeneIope saw them together yesterday. at Jimmy's Rockhouse. She is 16 and her name is Lydia. He looked he had a crush. She is not stopping. You know she is one of those, she goes, if it is necessary... - Very interesting for others. Is she really one of those? - Oh! Bronze-Teint, mascara! - The daughter from AIain DeIon and Mona Lisa. - We have to stop it. What do you think? Strangers can often help. - Outrageous! - Does your mother knows it? - Why should I tell her? - Make him jealous. - Those tricks are too old. - How do you do it nowdays? - Madame Beretton! - Are you there? - What did you say? - She's just arrived! With Raoul! What? Yes, Lydia too. They skate today. I met an incredible guy! Dustin Hoffman but blond! - Yes? - Is Vic with you? - No, why? - I've just arrived home and she's not here. - Where were you? - That's not important. I'm really concerned! - HeIIo! - Mom's not here. PeneIope's neither. - Who is there? - Francois Beretton, Vic's father. - Ah, ok! - Where is she? - She is out with Penelope. - But where? - Ok, she is in Jimmy's Rockhouse. I have chickenpox, or else I would be there too. If mom asks Penelope was at your place! - Ok, Thank you. - No problem. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - I want to dance so much. I let him to you. How you like him? - Well a nice DonaId Duck. Ok! - Are you dancing with my firend? - Ok. - A pair of skates. - Your dad is here! - That is Vic's father! What does he want here? Vic's dad? - Do you want to dance? Are you coming? - Dad please listen to me! - Stop! You are going home now! - One second! One second, please! - I'll explain it to you. - Are you insane? - Are you totaly crazy? - Who is dancing with Vic? - Don't know. - Vic needs a father. A man, who is making the rules, you understand? It's important in her age. Really smooth, yes? Respect and discipIine are very important! But, a family is needed. Yes! What is that? - My Angora puIIover. This way it won't get hard. - Well after what has happened today... What's happened today... I should... Hopefully it is smooth enogh. Hopefully. And its raining! And my wipers are broken. - Done! Good night... - Good Night. - Shit. - Francois... Francois, wake up! - What... what time is it? - It's past 6. - I don't want Vic to see you here. - You mean... she will be shocked? - If she sees you in the bed, she'll think that you came back. - And didn't i come back? - No, Francois. - One month no party, 14 days no cinema and meetings with your grandparents. About the birthday... I don't want to talk. - Just don't get busted. Like 1918, when i went with Fujita... on weekends... Old japanese painter, a semi-god! I told at home, "I'm doing a pilgrimage to Lourdes". About the meetings I know something. I will play in BrusseI infront of Queen FabioIa. Do you want to come with me? - Yes, but they won't let me. - Leave that to me. - And what do I do with Mathieu? - Don't mind him! - Don't you have anything better? - That is your only choice. - HeIIo, dad. Oh, thank you. - Kids, today we will go eat fancy! - But mom is not here. - Oh. Then we go alone. - As lovers. What? Right now? - Yes, go change! Yes! - And here it was. Here she told me that you are on the way. We sat over there. - Were you surpised? And how did she told it to you? - With a drawing. You know her. One morning I'm going to the clinic, I was just before the examination, and there was a caricature of me with a huge belly. Very funny. And in the evening we went to eat here. I still know what she ordered a double portion spaghetti and strawberries. - Did you eat from it? - Oh yeah I munched like hell. - I won't have kids. - Hm, when the right one comes... - If one day one will come, who will love me, you know, and he doesn't love me back, he will suffer, I'm telling you. - Is it that bad? Because of... Mathieu? - It is like a pain in the stomach. It hurts! - Yeah. Same for me. Dumb. It is really stupid. - Too stupid. - It's not easy. - It is really not easy. - No, please no! - Hey, go away! Move on, kid! - Hurry, hold on! Common hurry! - Thank you! - You are bleeding. - Yes. Without you I would be... Not often that someone... Can I... Invite you for a drink? - No thanks. - I beg you! How can I show my thankfulness? - You know what would make me happy? - No, what? Tell me. - If you could leave my wife alone! - Already back? - Our dance teacher is sick. Can you tell me about the spanish succession-war? - What? The spanish suc... Let me think. Louis XIV... The austrians... germans... In one hour someone will come to get the drawings. Let's do it later! - If it's about my problems you never have time! - At school you are alive and friendly, and what about here? - Who said that? - Here, you never smile, you never tell me a thing. I can't give you a kiss. You just get alive when it's about party. Ah, I'm already acting like an oldschool mother. And the thing with your father, I will explain it. We can talk about everything. I didn't tell you because I thought it was better not to, I feel that you are slowly going out of my control... - Is that a cage here? - Yes. But the door is open. If you don't need me, you can go away. But it's to early for that, don't you think? - And when is dad coming back? - HeIIo? Ah, Hello. Very good, thanks. - Listen, your ex-husband... - He is not my ex-husband. We just live separated for now. He is not up to date. - I met him yesterday at a fight. - Is he injured? - Who is it? - What do you say? How many were they? - He gave me a black eye. - What now? He struck you down or did he save you? - Both. - Ok. We'll speak later again. - Ok, see you. - Who was that? - A friend. A college from the workshop. - Do I know him? - No. - That is Penelopes friend's dad. Isn't he sexy? I have to go. See you. - See you. - (Samantha) Hello. - Hello. - I spoke with you some time ago. I'm Penelope's sister. - Oh yes... - Yes. - Are you waiting for Vic? - Today at 5. No women! - Ok. - Jean-Pierre is coming too. at 5o'clock, ok? - Wait a sec. - The chickenpox are gone. - First your hitting teenagers, now that! Are you crazy? - Could you repeat that? - In the dark you look like a playboy, but in the light, you are just an old maniac. - Give me that helmet! Will you... - Take your fingers off! Will you... Take your fingers off! - Stop it! be resonable! I said stop! - What are you doing? Aren't you ashamed? - Mathieu, stop it! I'm telling you to stop, Mathieu! Stop it! What is that for? What happened? - Are you looking for this? - Dad what is going on? Here. - Nothing. - Thanks, Vic. - What? Are you two know each oher? - He's my german teacher. - Come! Hey! - Was that Vic's father? - And you knew it? Yeah... - He wanted to beat you? Great! that's great! - Yeah great. - If you knew what that whistle means to me! That's him! And his lips were on it. Did you see the heart he attached on it? - Nice idea. - When I saw the bundle, I wanted to cry. I did! No, he went to Cabour. - Well, we can't go there. But Amsterdam. Rembrandts "Night Watch"! Bruges with his buildings! And then Brussel, the concert! - Julia and Romeo were just 15. - Sure. But you see where did it go. What about Vermeer? - We love each other like the adults. Why can't we do it like them? I don't want to wait, till the age of 18. - Where would you be in this moment? - In Cabour. We would have a rendezvous at the beach, I would jump in his arms, we would forgive everything and then sleep together. Why not? There is "the Pill"! - Ah, I forgot that. But the pill helps to not get pregnant but do not protect against the pain of the heart. - I hate when you speak to me like I'm just a 3 year old child. - I never did. - Where are you going? - To Cabour! - HeIIo? Could I speak to Mathieu ? - Yes. - He's there! What should I tell him? - You are in Deauville visiting a friend! - HeIIo, Mathieu, here is Vic. - Where are you? - Cabour - Ah! And with who? - Nobody. I ran away. - Are you stupid? - What? How did you get here? - Hitchiking. - Can we see each other? - I think so. - Where are you sleeping? - What should i say now? - I dont know. Where you want. - I have a cold. In 1 hour in front of the casino, ok? - What were you thinking? And your friend in DeauviIIe? Yes, your grandmother is'nt so good, ok but your "friend" was ideal! Let him decide. DO not spoil his holidays! Your arriving like: Hello here I am, now be happy! But a women, that gives herself has to be a present and not a hindering factor. - If he loves me, he will forgive me. - No, that's just silly! Give yourself to him, without throwing yourself away. That's how you stay independent. - You are scared that I will sleep with him. - Be careful! There are kids, who already have kids at the age of 14. - So, what should I do? You won't leave me, will you? - You did not answer me! Did you left her here? - It wasn't like that! Lydia, she was just... - How far did you get with her? - Shouldn't you call home? - Now I can guess. - Do you dance? - No, she's not dancing! Come! - Where? - MademoiseIIe, I would like to pay. - Here we are at peace. - What are you saying? - Sch! There are always people hanging around here. Come in. - Is it a duck? - That was just my brothers duck. - What are you doing? - I'm inflating the air mattress. - If you are cold, there a some clothes. Here, take that. - Thanks, I'm not cold. - You did not say anything, about what happened at home. - Why do you ask? - Yeah, I think you are... - Mathieu, I did not ran away because of her, but to be with you. - 5.000 FFF. Good. Pull your card Sir. - You are risking a lot, Madame. - Much more than you think. - What is it? - I can't breathe trough the nose. - Ow! Something hit me. That was the rake. - Were you together the entire night? You and Lydia. - No. - That's good that you are here. - In your arms it's like you know, like... that was worth the detour. I mean the way here. - What's that? - The mattrass. - I fill it up. It's 3o'clock already! - You wanna leave? - I have to work early. I begin at 6, my mother... - Is your mother that important to you now? - You should call yours. - Great! I get here trough hitchhiking, I find a guy with an air mattrass at the beach and both are empty! If you just drop here. - The cops will look for you. - I hope you will protect me! - I did not ask you to come! - Then go! I can get trough this alone. - You hitchhiked until here but don't think you are the best! - Go! Your mother is surely worried! - Me too! - Vic, it's me. Please open it! - Not sleeping? - Your mom is. - And don't you ask what happened? - No, but I will listen. - I can reassure you, there was nothing. And what did you do? - I lost at bakara. - But I won at Poker. - Come in! - Where can i put this, Madame? - Here on the table. - Madame. - Oh, I'm starving! (inaudible) - (Etienne) Friday you are coming with us. We start at 3 because of the traffic jam! Ok? And if we go eat something? - Pardon. - Good evening. - Oh, thanks. - What is that? - You are surely hungry. For two. - Ah, they are cute! - I miss... Monsieur Thomson. - Eric? Why? - I thought we'll eat the three of us. You surely sent him one of your cartoon copies as well. Otherwise you would just waste your thoughts for one. 2 dads are better for a child. That happens often. Think about Jesus. - I was thinking about you. - Please dont say anything now. - I'm pregnant. - What, already? - 2 months now. - Agadir, the beach, the sun and the two of us, so nice, but... - I just wanted to take vacation. Nothing else. - (Teacher) So there are multiple families. You can differ them with simple tests - Did you get him? - No it was his mother on the phone, again. - I said I was you. He's still sick. He had a bad cold in Cabour. I'm not feeling so well neither. - Let me see. Ah, nothing. - A party without Mathieu is like a wedding without the groom. - But the others are coming! - I only want Mathieu! - Do you have a lot? I have to go. - No, no, now I... just the neonlights and a compressor. - Ah, there you are! - But... what is all that? - A clinic. - And what about my party tomorrow? - With all that stuff around? - I have to go to the publisher, - I will be back in an hour, we will find uot something. Promise! And lock up, when they are finished! - HeIIo? Ah, Penelope. A disaster? Here too. Have you got the chickenpox? - The fists thing I got for free by my sister! - Sorry, Francoise, I just wanted to tell you that today... That LeasingmateriaI. We have to talk! - I have nothing to tell you! - Please listen! So yesterday... - Doesn't matters, today is different. - Sure, I know that... What? What is different today? - (Worker) One moment. - What is different? - I did not have a lover yesterday, today I have one, that is different! - You have nothing else to tell me? - Yes, your daughter... wants to give a party! And she's thinking about that party for weeks! But your stuff... you spoiled it! - Gratulation! Here is the echo-image! It will be a boy! - Please sign. - So much stuff for a room. - My God! Isn't that a bit too much? Look his chin, just like yours! - Not convincing. Sorry. - You can be happy. You have a beautiful wife, she has talent, you are having a child she is making the best scrambled eggs in Paris and she loves you. - And she has a lover! - No! God, that is so exciting! - You are standing on her side. - She's is the best for you! - I will sent her flowers and a card. - I'm telling you for years that you are an idiot, but you didn't believe me. - Keep your wise talk for yourself! Could you ever hold a guy on your side? Sorry. - No, it makes me younger. You don't get... yelled at, at my age. Can I still tell you something? That child is your only chance, to get your wife back. Use that chance! It's almost to late. - Almost. - Whos baby? Who is getting a baby? - Us. - How is your sister? - Awesome! Red dots everywhere. Even on the nose. And at the eyes, on her forehead, like freckles! - Where are the chairs going? Up there! Tell everyone, ok? - We don't have enough ham! - No, that is enough. Main thing, we have enough cola. - Did GeraIdine bring the cake? - She still has to come! Are you leaving? - I still have some time. But they will come soon. He will surely come too. Have fun! Bye! - Will you write me? - Of course! As soon as I arrive. - You know now that I am 14, I maybe could have a moped... - Why not? - After... - After what? - After the baby. I don't want you to get excited about it. - I called a moment ago to reserve 2 tickets to Venice. - Monsieur and Madame Beretton? - Yes! - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - Thanks. - Ah, will you be travelling? - Yes. - Yes. - Where? - Afrika. - AIone? - No, with Eric. And you? - What do you mean? - Are you going on a trip too? - Yes. I just wanted to get my rubber boots. - Will you help me? I'm late. Can you get me a taxi? I have to be at 8 at Roissy. (note: airport in Paris) - Listen,...I... My plane... starts at 9. If you want I take you there. - Where are you flying? - Venice. - Should I open? - Hi! - What is that? - I have to wear it for 6 months. - Thanks. Hi. - Poupette! - Happy Birthday! - Oh, Thank you.
