THE BACHELOR AND LOVE Is that all you have to say? Could you do it better. What do you want, a statement? That would be fine. I've been wanting to tell you something for months. What? You are the cutest girl in the world. Oh, thank you. That's what all the girls want to hear. Not seriously. You're not flabby or anything like that. You are pretty and cute. And you know what I mean. Yes, I see what you mean. Who will it be? Let them kill me if I know. But whoever it is, I don't want to open. - You better ... - Yes. Only be a moment. Do not go too far. - ¡Joe! - ¡Charlie! How are you? How are you, Joe? How is Ethel? Gosh, good to see you, Joe! How's everything going in Indianapolis? Do you want a drink Do you still drink martini? - The same drink, the same woman. - Right now. Why didn't you tell me you were coming ? - Didn't my telegram reach you? - No. It's funny, I sent you one. Anyway, I'm going to stay with you. Voucher. Welcome aboard, Joe. - What a mansion! -Yes. It doesn't look like the tree house you used to fall from as a child. Do all the theater representatives in New York live like this? How much money do you earn? Almost as much as I spend. How is everything in the old factory? The Indiana Pharmaceutical Company appears to continue to float. Good. Drink with me, old friend. - Joe. - Charlie. I'm glad to see that success hasn't changed you. Your martinis are still lousy. - Get out of there. - Have I already asked about Ethel? Ethel? It's okay. And what about Charlie? How is it going? Well, I don't know. Last week we thought we shouldn't have put your name on it. He fell out of the tree house. OMG. - Was he hurt? - No, it fell on his sister. OMG. It's okay, Charlie. It was a small tree. Good. What brings you to New York? Business? Not really. I have left Ethel. What? Have you left Ethel? - You can not be serious. - Hello. - Have you abandoned her? - Hello. To the mother of your children? The woman who gave you the best years of her life? Honey, I'm sorry to interrupt, but it's almost six now. Yes? Wow, that's a shame. Poppy Matson, Joe McCall. - How are you? - How are you? Thanks for the visit. - You must be kidding. - I'll collect all this. - You don't have to, honey. - You have not...? I take care of that. I'll call you soon. - Morning? - Not tomorrow. - You call me. -Yes. - By phone. - By phone. - Soon? - Yes very soon. Goodbye. Charlie, did I tell you? - My uncle has white fish. - What? You do not remember? You told me you loved it. He's going to send me one. Yes very good. - I'll call you when I get there. - Clear. And we will have a wonderful dinner with Burgundy by candlelight ... ... a tablecloth of damask and lemons. I am wishing it. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Where the hell did it come from? Does not matter. What about this thing about you leaving Ethel? Ethel? I have left her. That girl is beautiful, is there more like her? Forget the beautiful girl. Let's calm down and talk about this. Why have you left Ethel? It was his idea. It has not been as you think. Really? How was it then, Joe? How has it been? Well, it has been like this: Last week, we celebrated our 11th anniversary. Did you get my silver tray? We already have seven silver trays , but thank you. After everyone left, Ethel and I looked at each other ... ... and Ethel said, "Joe, I love you so much. Why don't we rest from each other? " And I said, "I could go to New York to take care of something." And she said, "Do it. Go see some shows, live off Charlie. Then run back here ... ... and chase me around the house like you used to. "And so ... Devils! I told you that Ethel was a smart woman . Let's toast to her. - Charlie. - Joe. - Ethel. - Ethel. Hello Darling. Hi Jessica. Now I'm a little busy. Nothing happens. It turns out that I went to the market today ... ... and I ran into this wonderful Wisconsin Colby ... ... and I know it's the cheese you like the most . That's why I brought it to you. I have a friend in the market ... ... that he will let me know as soon as the first apples appear I'm counting on you for a great ... How can you live in a place like this? Te presento a Joe McCall. Jessica Collins. - How are you, Mr. McCall? - Miss Collins. Do you know someone who lives with such a mess? Well, I don't know what Mr. McCall will think . Go on with your business and pay no attention to me. I'll make this place look a little neater. My God, here's a telegram you haven't opened yet. Someone could have died or something. What this house needs is an old-fashioned thorough cleaning. A clean above is not enough. No sir. Thank you. Have you seen those curtains? Those curtains need a good old-fashioned shaking ... ... and I'm going to do it. And that sofa too. What have you been doing on that couch? I appreciate what you're doing, but not now. On another occasion. - You always say the same thing. - Actually no. I will call you. - Well, don't forget, did you hear it? - I heard it. - You promise? - I promise. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Mr. McCall. Tiger. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Where I am? Where do all those banners come from? Banners? - Why do you call them banners? - Okay... For your information, Mr. McCall, Poppy is a senior editor at Doubleday. And Jessica turns out to be the owner ... ... of the largest chain of women's clothing stores in the country. Authentic banners. - Charlie, I'd like to ask you something. - How about this? My friend is coming to spend a couple of weeks with me. I have to shave, I have an appointment. Whether they are banners or not, tell me one thing. How can you be with so many women? Because I am big, strong and tough. Don't think you will control me like you did before. Charlie... ... you are already 35 years old. Aren't you still upset about the college dance? You are right, yes. Three hundred girls in a queue. And in front of that tail is that lovely, sweet girl ... ... a real doll, smiling at me. All I have to do is take three steps and say: "May I have this dance?" But I do not do it. At the end of the queue, I see this tall girl ... ... the goofy with glowing eyes. Even from where I am, I know it will give me trouble. And what do i do? Clear. I made my way through half a kilometer of organdy ... ... while you took the three steps forward. You get Ethel and I a paternity suit. At least they absolved you. Why shouldn't they? - I didn't put a hand on him. - It's what Ethel said. From the beginning, Ethel said, "Charlie couldn't do it. - So is. - You don't have the necessary experience. " Say it? Hi dear. No, I can't tonight. No, tomorrow night either. No, no, no, the house is clean. Thanks for calling. Yes. Okay, I'll call you. Goodbye. Boy what you got It's not about what I have, Joe, it's about what I don't have. A wife. A wife? When I came to New York, I imagined it would be like home. Meet a girl, take her to the movies ... ... send her candy and flowers, woo her a bit. AND? It doesn't work that way in New York. They are more cheeky. As soon as a bachelor steps foot in this city, they jump on it. Even before unpacking, you already have three girls around. It is wonderful. A simple guy like me has women without looking for them. - And is it always like this? - All the time. Do you just have to be single? Dude, you got it under control. I do not. It's New York, Joe. The city is full of girls. Truth be told, every once in a while I get bored. I'm sorry for you, friend. You know what I mean. It's fun, but let's get something clear. You are the one who has it under control. Me? I would trade this hustle for your situation without thinking. You come home in the afternoon, to a nice house ... ... with three kids running up to you saying "daddy". You walk in and there is Ethel with a nice apron ... ... surrounds you with his arms, gives you a sound kiss and says: "Joe, we have to carpet the house." - Don't criticize Ethel in front of me. - I won't criticize Ethel. If it weren't for Ethel, we wouldn't have a carpeted house today . Can you imagine that? People could see the floor by the edge of the carpet. And the children don't come running to see me ... ...when I arrive home. They are very tired. They are all day giving dance classes, fencing classes ... ... diction classes, rhythmic gymnastics classes ... ... drama classes, finger painting classes. Truth be told, Ethel is never home either. You have to take the dog to obedience classes. Come on, Joe. It cannot always be like this. Nerd. Is not always that way. Sometimes after the kids fall asleep ... ... all is quiet, the two of us at last. I light the fire in the fireplace ... ... Ethel takes out the brandy good ... ... we put together a couple of chairs ... I take her hand, she squeezes mine. "Honey," I tell him. "Darling," she says. "Don't you think it's time to put a dental appliance on Peter?" She can't stand having a child in the house without gadgets. I can't keep listening. I can't believe Ethel, innocent Ethel ... ... with that angel smile and the most beautiful body in the Midwest ... Still the same? Yes. Don't tell me you don't like it anymore. I love it. After eleven years married, I have never looked at another woman. - Do you think about looking at them now? - Of course not. Why? When guys start telling me how many years they haven't done it ... ... I think they are about to. No matter what you say, I bet you were fully happy with your life ... ... until you got here and saw mine. You may be right, friend. After all, it's eleven years. Yes, eleven wonderful years. Do not forget. What's up, now it's the night shift? Nerd. She is not one of those girls. This is something special. What do you have, your own vacuum cleaner? No, it is barely clean. Although it does order a little. I see. What do you have with her? It is very special. Do you know he used to play with Stokowski? When, as a child? How old are you? Shut up. You'll see Sylvia in a ... Here we have her. Which of the gentlemen is Sylvia? Now comes the surprise. Sylvia, Mr. Joe McCall. Joe, Miss Crewes. It's an honor, Miss Crewes. Poor thing, she's looking forward to coming here. I will hurry. Sylvia doesn't take long to get here from the NBC set. What did you do? Shoot it with the cannon? - Hello. - Hello. Is in the kitchen. I know. ¡Eh, eh! - Who? - Sorry, I can't introduce you. I have forgotten your last name. It's Helen ... something. I'll take care of Joe. Come on, handsome. Thank you. You gave the dog my name. It has touched me. She comes and takes him for walks twice a day. One of these nights, I'll have to take her to dinner. It would be very kind of you, Sultan. - Good evening, Miss Crewes. - Hello George. - Everything installed, Mr. Loughran? -Yes. Everything except the piano and a couple of side tables. I am going. Hello Darling. Is that the tuxedo? - We were unpacking ... - Bye. This is different. To return to. Did he tell you he would return? Yes. What is your name? McCall. Do you have a tux, Mr. McCall? To tell the truth, no. Go and change. Five minutes, I swear. Can I get you a drink, Mr. McCall? Please, I'll put it on. I have never heard such courtesy in this apartment. - ¿ Whisky? - Vale. Don't have a tux? Tell me, do you have a blue suit? Yes, at the top, see? - I see. - Water? Please. That is my wife and children. You are Joe McCall! I am Sylvia Crewes. Hi. Thank you. The robe Charlie sent Ethel for Christmas, did it fit her? Did you buy it? I knew Charlie couldn't have that much taste. Who is Peter? The one without gadgets. That photo was taken six months ago. Charlie uses your family a lot in courtship. And I use the term loosely. What does it mean? When you don't know what to say ... ... starts lying saying that he would like to have a nice house ... ... a wife and children like his old friend Joe. Has it not occurred to you that it might be true? Mr. McCall, if it had n't occurred to me , you wouldn't be here. Forty-five seconds. I am coming right away. You better. I saw her on television just now. Yes? It is very kind of you... ... considering they cast Range Rider on the rival chain. I do not get it. Are you a musician in an NBC orchestra? How did you end up with "Tin Ear" Charlie? It doesn't have a tin ear. I have been working with him and he has made quite a bit of progress. ¿Charlie? He loves Peter and the wolf. I listened. Go? That was not easy for him. Charlie told me you've known each other since fourth grade. Yes, even before. Since kindergarten. What was it like then? Little. - What did you do as a child? - How old? From five to ten. To play the violin. - From ten to 20? - To play the violin. And of the 20 ... - Say it. ... at 28? Thanks a lot. To play the violin. And I'll keep playing the violin until I die or get married ... ... whichever comes first. Here I am. You are very handsome. I'd ask you to come with us, but no. I do not blame you. If you get tired, that becomes a bed. If you can't sleep, I have Seconal in the medicine cabinet. If you have a hard time staying awake, I also have Benzedrine. If you don't clear up, take one of each. If you get hungry, there is a whole cheese in the fridge. That's for fixing yourself so fast. Who is more fortunate than me? I do not. Don't wait for me awake. Goodbye. Goodnight. - Thank you. - Hi, Helen. Excuse me, I don't know your last name. Charlie forgot to introduce us, but I'm his best friend. Truth be told , he named it for me. My name is Joe McCall. Hello, namesake. To your bed, Joe. Why are you in such a hurry? Let's have a drink. No thanks. I left dinner on the fire. - Leave her there and let's have dinner outside. - No thanks. Why not? Mr. McCall, you are a married man. Charlie told you, huh? Well, to tell the truth, no. Do you mean you knew just by looking at me? Of course. Goodnight. AUDITION OF SINGERS AND DANCERS FOR "SUMMER SKY" I don't understand about this. It's good? It cannot be. He is not our client. Thanks a lot. Who is the next one? A certain Miss Gillis. Miss Gillis, please. Take a look at this girl, Charlie. They signed her last week. Okay, Miss Gillis. Would you mind telling us about yourself? You know, your training, your theater experience and all that. Don't be nervous, Miss Gillis. I am not nervous at all. My name is Julie Gillis and I was born here in New York City. I'm 22 years old. I mean, I was 21 and a half a week ago. But six months after my birthday, I get a year older. Everyone waits until the last minute to add another year, but I ... Well, maybe I'm a little nervous. Go ahead, Miss Gillis. Tell us what you want. Well, there isn't much to tell. My only theatrical experience was last June ... ... at a college play in Briarwood. We did The Pirates of Penzance. There was a representative there who made me sign something ... ...and here I am. Still there? We're still here, Miss Gillis. Sing or dance or just keep talking. You better sing. I talk too much. And I'd better take off my glasses. I see her too pretty with her glasses on. Easy, man. I think this girl has something, Eddie. - Bring her to the Bergie. I want to talk to her. - Voucher. You don't care, do you? Because I should? We will be there with you. ¿Ciavelli? How about? They have hired Ciavelli as conductor of the Summer Symphony. Ciavelli? How about? It is shameful. I'm not saying I'm bad as a violinist, but director? It's ridiculous. That bum hasn't scored a goal in his entire life. He's a ball boy. He's good with the classics ... ... but what are they going to do when they pass Brahms? They will take out a reserve player. They would not give the job to a woman. Of course not. It would be very hard in the locker room. Very funny. What things did you do to laugh before I arrived? I'm sorry I asked. Julie, Charlie Reader, a talented man . Miss Gillis. - Hello. - How are you? Miss Crewes, Mr. McCall. Sylvia and Joe. - Hello. - Two talented friends of mine. - See you later. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - He wants to drink something? - Coffee. - We have a lot of that. - Sugar and milk? - Yes please. I can only stay a few minutes. I just wanted to tell you that we were impressed. - It was great. - Great. I have spoken with the producer, Sammy Sayers. He says he will surely give you the role. Good. Thank you. It's your first professional work, right? Yes. Not a little nervous about acting for the first time? The theater is fine, but it's only temporary. Do you plan to do something else? Yes. Get married, I hope. Do you already have a young person in mind? There are many young people, but I have not found mine yet. A pretty girl like you won't have much trouble. I hope not. That is, having a profession is fine, but not to replace marriage. "Don't you agree, Miss Crewes?" - Yes, Miss Gillis, I am. I completely agree. Seriously, don't you think marriage is the most important thing in the world? A woman is not a woman until she is married and has children. And because? Because it feels fulfilled. It is not like this? So is. You're in agreement? Of course. What true American would n't be? This true American is not. Why not? To feel fulfilled you must have a man. And it is possible that what you like he will not like. My man will like it. Should it have minimum requirements? Yes, I know everything except his blood type. Tell us about him. Seriously? Because it could take me all day talking about this. Go ahead, Miss Gillis. Well, the first thing I want in a man is for him to like children. - How many would you like to have? - Three. That is the magic number. But not right away. The first two years we will live in New York. We will be young and want to have fun. There is no better place than New York to have fun, right? The children will come later. - But not in New York? - No, we will move to the country. Maybe the first child is born in New York. In what hospital? At the hospital... He's making fun of me. Ignore him. Tell us more. We are very interested. Fascinated. Look, I know this sounds weird if you don't know me ... ... but people who know me think it's pretty normal. Sure you do, Miss Gillis. He has a house in the country and a baby, what does he do then? Have two more children. I haven't said anything. Yes? When the kids get out of Scarsdale Institute ... ¿Scarsdale? Of course. Everyone knows that they have the best educational system in the country. - Sure, everyone knows. - Come on, Joe ... Seriously. Everybody in Indianapolis sends their kids to Scarsdale. I've been teased before, but I know what I want. That's fine. Follow. Tell us more. As I was saying, when children leave high school to go to university ... Miss Gillis, don't you think you're getting too anticipated? Well, a person cannot improvise their way through life. Some do. Some have to. Sure, but that's because they make their plans too late. I would like you to respond to that. Since I have told you all my childhood dreams ... - Do you really have to go? - Really. - Miss Crewes. - Goodbye. - I'll order a taxi for you. - Do not bother. Mr. McCall. I couldn't leave the mother of three children ... ... walking alone down the street in sinful New York City. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Goodbye. She is the scariest girl I have ever met in my life. Even I am shaking. Tell me, Miss Gillis, what are your plans for the next 400 years? Well I'll have some kids first ... How do you plan to have them? In the usual way. No, in what order? Well, first a boy, then a girl, then another boy ... ... and then a chocolate cream. What typical North American community do you plan to live in? In Las Vegas. Where else? You know what contracts are like. For a week or two you won't be ready. How about you and I go to dinner tomorrow? - Together? - Of course. Why? Why? I mean, for what reason? Must there be a reason for a man and a woman ... ... sit and eat together? That is, tomorrow night, you will be hungry and want to eat. But why with you? It's a simple question, right? Yes, I wish I had a simple answer. I wish I had an answer. I will put it another way. Tomorrow night, you will be hungry and want to eat. But why with me? Miss Gillis ... ... over the years, I have discovered that eating with a beautiful woman ... ... not only a pleasure, but great for digestion. I've known him for a few minutes, but he seems like a good person. He's even attractive with that sloppy, unconventional look. Thanks a lot. But I can't have dinner with all the attractive men I know. It is not part of my plan. What plan is that? My marriage plan. When I meet someone ... ... and I don't feel an immediate chemistry between us ... ... I am educated and nothing more. You mean you don't feel any chemistry between us? Exactly. Thank you very much for the coffee. Do you understand why I can't go to dinner with you? - It's crystal clear, Miss Gillis. - Good. Goodnight. You arrive just in time. Were you kidding with what you told me? No. There she is. Talk with her. Ethel Barrymore signed a contract like this. Helen Hayes, Sarah Bernhardt. Leave me alone with Miss Gillis. - Sure, it's all yours. - Hello Julie. Are you going to yell at me too, Mr. Reader? I'm not going to do it, Julie. I will speak calmly. I want to get to the point. You don't have to tell me it's a theater tradition ... ... have everyone sign a binding contract. Good. So we can skip that. Do you think it's fair to Mr. Sayers and investors ... ... that you leave four and a half months after the premiere of the play? I'm sorry. If I postpone my marriage once, I may have to postpone it again. I can't take that risk. I'm afraid I can only sign until March 12. What is special about March 12? It's the day my parents got married . March 12. And in my plan, that's the deadline. It doesn't make sense, Julie. Because the other day you told me that you hadn't met your man yet. But I'll do it. If you have a plan and you really believe in it ... ... will work. Why don't we go to the Bergie and discuss this? No thanks, I've already eaten. - We could have dinner today ... - Mr. Reader, I've already explained ... ... what I think about having dinner with you. Julie... ... it's not about chemistry, it's about business. He promised me he wouldn't scream. I need to get some fresh air. - How has it been...? - What happened? Did you get me to sign? Sam, it is best if you sign until March ... ... and by then I can make him change his mind. - Where are you going? - To the nearest bar. Wait, I'm going with you. Tell me. I'm not sorry. No this. Yes. Yes, I will tell you. Thank you. Tell me. I'm not sorry. No this. Miss Snr? Could you spell it out, please? ¿S-N-R? Yes, Miss Snr, United Nations, Thursday night, curry dinner. I will tell. Goodbye. Miss Snr? ¿What kind of name is that Tell me what you want, ma'am. Hi Jessica. How are you? No, sorry, it hasn't arrived yet. Really? Yes, I'll tell you as soon as I get there. - Hello Joe. - Hello, sheik. What does Jessica want? What all. Feed you, take care of yourself, pat yourself to burp. Sew monograms on your stupid shirts. Did Carol buy the thread for the monograms? - Yes. - Good girl. And Jessica has found a new cheese. ¿S-N-R? Yes, Miss Snr. He wants to meet on Thursday and have a curry for dinner. You're a good boy, Joe. You'll find something special in the pay envelope, Saturday. I hope you do not mind. I held your phone for three minutes this morning ... ... with a personal call. Ethel called on the phone. How is it going? She says that she is restless and bored and is going to carpet the bathroom. You answer. My ear is deforming. Say it? Hi Sayers. No. I don't know where it is. Haven't been to rehearsal? All I can suggest is that you call the police ... ... or the nearest hospital. Or try the morgue. I know it's not silly, Sayers. Are you sorry to have met her? What about me? He didn't even want to have dinner with me. Yes, if I know anything about her, I'll call you. Goodbye. Gillis has not appeared in the trial. How about? I try not to think about her and I am succeeding. And now nBC is taking you to the Knightsbridge Armory ... ... to the American Home Fair. Before showing you the cool decorating innovations ... ... we will turn our cameras towards the enthusiasts ... ... who have gathered here. Charlie, come here. What happens? Check it out. Now we come to the display of the Decorator's Refuge ... ... with the kitchen of tomorrow, appliances that will make your life easier. - Is that what you called me for? - Wait for them to approach the public. If anyone has any questions, I'm here for that. I have a question. Sorry. Heavens, it's Gillis. For how many people is this kitchen designed? It is designed for what, according to experts ... ... will be the average American family in a few years. Husband, wife and three children. That's perfect. I have to go there and take her to rehearsal. - Because you? - It is my duty. I am your representative. Come now. Don't give me the tale of duty. That girl has you captivated because she doesn't want anything with you. You don't know what you're talking about. Get away from that girl. It is a trap prepared to hunt. And that? Do you think I'll blurt out a plan like this? I do not know. Why don't you keep falling out of the tree house? I haven't fallen out of the tree house in years. Don't worry about old Charlie. It sounds familiar. "Don't worry about Charlie." Isn't that what you were screaming as you fell? Very funny. Wait. You have a date with Sylvia. You must pick it up at the NBC studio. You have a career. You will come up with something. No, Mr. Wilson. It is not... Do I have to tell you again ... ... that this house was designed by the best modern architect in the world? Well, I'm not going to point, but I know that ... Hello, Mr. Reader. What is he doing here? It is funny. I was going to ask you the same question. I have the naive feeling that they have been waiting for you at rehearsal for a long time. OMG. I only went in for a few minutes. - I must have been here hours. - In that case, let's go. Wait. I'll ask you a question and then we'll go. Does the combination of this room and this furniture ... ... and Mr. Wilson in that chair says something to you? I dont know. Should? Okay, yes. I love this style of home and I love the decor ... ... but when a man sits in that chair, he doesn't seem to fit. It seems out of tune. It's not your fault, Mr. Wilson. Four other men agreed to sit in that chair, but ... You have no idea what I 'm talking about, do you? You have it? Could you let Mr. Reader sit down ? - You're two hours late. - You will understand. Believe me sir. Blind obedience works best. What have I done? Is awesome. Suddenly the room looks different. See, Mr. Wilson? Ok, class is over. Come on Julie. Mr. Wilson, visit us sometime. - Yes, but what about the chair? - Thanks a lot. - Awesome. - Okay, Julie. - Awesome. - Here. NBC ARTISTS INPUT - Hi, Sylvia. - Joe! What brings you to this stormy place? Does it have to do with Charlie not coming? Well, truth be told ... OK bro. Let it go. Well, it's about Charlie being called ... To do military service? No no no. Your boss has called an urgent staff meeting and ... Would you like to look me in the eye, Mr. McCall? Not especially. I don't mind being lied to ... ... if I see that it is an elaborate lie. A little imagination. It occurred to Charlie that maybe I could stand in for him. That is, if it's okay with you. Let's take a look at you. A slow turn. You will serve. Do you want to be my partner today? I don't see the way to avoid it. I will be your partner. These... ... angry at Charlie and me, right? No, not really. Why not? You should be. I have a high IQ and a low boiling point. Would you like to buy me a milk shake ... ... and a tuna sandwich at the corner store? I will be happy to do it. And could we go have a drink later? Who knows? The night is young and we are adults, anything can happen. Will we dance? Not bad for the first try. I liked it. He had a lot of sentimentality. - Thank you. - That's it. We are done. Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock. Including Miss Gillis. What did you think, Mr. Reader? You heard the director. You said you had a lot of sentimentality. It's superficial maudlin, Julie. Of the worst. You can't spoil a song like that. It should have more warmth. Look, I'll show you what I mean. See what I mean? You should make it a little smoother. Wow, you sing very well. Well, I'm starving. Let's have dinner. - Together? - Sure, let's go. Tell me? Hi, Poppy. No, it hasn't arrived yet. Sure, I'll tell you. I will not forget. Goodbye. Hello Joe. - Your whole harem has called. - Good girls. The last was Poppy. Your uncle's fish is in town. How? Yes, yes, I already remember. - Julie called? - No. Well, it'll be here in no time. - Can I make you a drink, Joe? - No thanks. Why do you have to woo that young lady? Why don't you calm down? First, it is made of cast iron. Second, he is too young for you. Third, you have so many women that you don't know what to do with them. And fourth, you do have a little problem, boy. I have seen how it developed. The symptoms are the classics. Irascibility, nervous alteration ... ... and even rude to your friends and loved ones. What you need, son, is female company. Thank you very much doctor. You're welcome. Joe, don't ever stay here alone all night, okay? In fact, I'm not staying. You have a date. Who? Anyone I know? Yes, Sylvia. - Again? - Again. That's great, Joe. Just great. - Did she call you? - No, I called her. The tables have been turned. In fact, I'm going to pick it up right now. Forgive me for setting a precedent. Another fact is that I have two dates with Sylvia tonight. One for dinner and one after the concert. Good evening, Sultan. - Hi dear. - Hi, Charlie. ¡Eh! Wait. Could you do it better. Yes I can. - Hi, Helen. - Hi, Charlie. How has Joe been today? - Like an angel. - As a... Are you going to tell me who that girl is? Be nice, Joe. - Bye, Charlie. See you tomorrow. -Yes. Yes, bye, Helen. Thanks a lot. Who is Miss Expressionless? She is a professional dog walker . If that is. Take the dog for a walk every day. I have never heard of professional dog walkers. And why does it have to be so attractive? Okay... I had never noticed that she was so attractive. What's up Julie? Dammit! You came here resentful about something. Okay... I'm getting a little tired. Charlie, I hadn't complained before, but do you think I like it? Like what? I know we are in the atomic age and we are two civilized adults. You have already made that clear. But we girls don't like to pick up a man from his house ... ... or stay in a bar. Especially when they plan the whole evening without consulting. - Consult? - So is. All the dates we have had have been planned by you. You have never asked me, not once, what I wanted to do. Well, honey, I'm sorry. Seriously sorry, babe. You should have mentioned it. From now on this is going to change. What do you want to do tonight? Well I do not know. We have the whole city to ourselves. Say something. Wow, I don't know. - What do you want? - No. No I do not. This is your night. Okay... Take your time. Think about it. Sure, I could ... I could make a little suggestion. Yes? There's a wonderful restaurant on Bank Street ... ... where they serve the best Valencian paella. Yes? Then we could go a few meters higher ... ... where there is a Mexican joint that I have not been to in a long time. They have a crazy band that plays the best rumba you've ever danced. Then we could go to the other side of the street ... That if you want. ... to a lovely cafe where they have the best coffee ... ... and the best guitar music in the whole city. ¿Charlie? Next time I tell you that I want to plan the afternoon ... ...Do not hear me. Okay, I won't. Because you know more about how to please a lady ... ... than any other man on the East Coast. Thank you. And there is no other lady that I want to please. Thank you. Thank you. If you give me a few seconds, I 'll go change. And we'll be leaving right away. Fantastic. - Meanwhile, I'll read your mail. - Fantastic. Julie. - Julie. - What happens? Nothing, you're very pretty, that's all. Well, you too. I'm glad you think so. We go to a Spanish joint. Let's dance tango to the door. I'm with you. Don't you like this joint? I find it boring. We could go out and go somewhere else. No thanks. I've had enough fun in just one afternoon. I can't take you home anymore. What would your mother say? I do not know. Mom is in Boston visiting my aunt. Will it stay long? I don't think I'll be back until tomorrow night. And your father? I guess it will be home, right? Daddy goes where Mommy goes and he won't be here until tomorrow night. Whoops. This joint is a bit boring. How could you suggest it? - Me? - Watch out. Get back, friend. Stand back. Thank you. Sorry. Goodbye. I like this idea. I don't know who I love more. If you or your aunt from Boston. Charlie, I think you should go. Why? I am a decent girl. It's a comment my parents hope I will make. Although you could prolong this if you had a drink before going to sleep. Miss Gillis, can I have a whiskey? Clear. But it will take a while. Because mom is a teetotaler and dad hides the bottles among my things. - Do you like it with water? - If it is okay. Tell me, are these your parents? Are very similar. Although I think Mom weighs 18 kilos more than him. I know what you're thinking. - Let me ask you something. Taking. - What? Does your father still have hair? A lock here and there. Okay, we'll make a pact. You don't go bald and I won't get fat. I'll toast to that. What do we have on the agenda? Let's take a break. Good idea. I've been wanting to tell you something for days. You are the cutest girl in the world. Tell me more things. Charmed. One second. Why did you do that? Because some words take on a different meaning ... ...in the dark. Charlie. You're not talking, you're nibbling on me. I'm afraid your idea and mine of laying down for a while are different. AND? Meanwhile, we will sit quietly and ... And that? And we will watch television. How good! And then we can go to the kitchen and make cupcakes. Remember, this six-cylinder, four-door convertible ... ... scratched and thermodynamic tires , only 1790. One thousand seven hundred and ninety? Was it a good year for cars? And now, we continue with the movie. We will meet again in a few minutes with another fantastic offer. Watching TV was not a good idea. - Not a good idea at all. - We better forget ... ... of this whole thing. You are interested in art? Well, I can pretend I do. It's okay. Because dad bought me a wonderful book for Christmas. It is full of fantastic reproductions of Renaissance masterpieces. This is more than I expected. Before teasing you, take a look at this. A Corot. Is the detail not impressive? The Jeremiah of Michelangelo. How are you, Meyer? You are impossible. Tell me, do you think her parents are out of town? Please! Wait a second. I want to drink in this impressive detail. - Charlie. - Julie. Julie. No, no, Charlie. Honey, there's no use fighting this. Everything is conspiring against us. Science, the arts and the animal kingdom. - Don't let them give you ideas. - I swear, the idea was mine. But it is the happiest couple in the neighborhood. They are entitled to it. What did i say I haven't said anything. Charlie. How many girls are there in your life? What? I said: How many girls are there in your life? Carol... ...Jayne... ... and that's it. "Poppy, Jessica, Miss Snr, Helen." What about them? Well, they are substitutes. They hardly ever enter the game. You are not funny at all. How many are there? You shouldn't ask those kinds of questions. I'm sorry. This is a new game for me. I don't know the rules. Julie, relax. How many? My life. It's a beautiful night and your parents are in Boston ... ... and there is no one in the whole world apart from you and me. And tomorrow? Tomorrow, the same. We can ride a horse or ... And the Monday? What do you want, a contract? No. I just want a clear answer to a clear question. How many girls are there in your life? Four hundred and ninety six. Before they were 497. Until one of them started asking impertinent questions. Thank you. You're welcome. Why don't you start crying? Isn't that what it is now? First the silly questions, then the silly answers ... ... and then the tears. Let's go. Do the whole number. Listen to me. Will you listen to me? Listen, divine gift for women. And listen well. From now on, you will come to pick me up at my house. You will ask me how I want to spend the afternoon. You will meet my parents and be polite to them. And you will bring me candy and flowers. - Sweets? - And you will leave all ... ... those girls. At 496. Why would you want to do something like that? Because I love you. Because you ... what? That's. Because I love you. Do you think it's something wonderful ... ... be in love with you? I never wanted to fall in love. Nor do I want to now. You are selfish, arrogant, spoiled ... ... and you're too old for me. - I see that ... - Too old. Too old. Too selfish, too arrogant, too spoiled. Only God will know why I love you, but I love you. And so from now on there will be some changes. - Listens. - Listen you. You think you are very important with your terrace, your luxurious nightclubs ... ... and your professional dog walker. But let me tell you something. You have to learn about women. - Me? - If you. And I'm going to try to straighten you out, if it's not too late. I will try to make a man out of you. Because I want to marry a man. Get married? Who asked you? So... ...What is all this? If you don't intend to marry me, tell me now. Because that's what I want. Not a terrace ... ... nor a Valencian "palela", or whatever you want to call it. Just a traditional marriage, a house and children ... ... and a life that has some meaning. You already finished? Yes. Okay, I take this as an ultimatum. - Yes. - And you want me to marry you. But first you want me to reform and change my habits. Yes. Agree. Now, this selfish, arrogant, spoiled , old man ... ... will tell you a thing or two. Before proposing to a man ... ... wait for me to show you a hint ... ... that you are interested. Also, don't start off by telling him he's a decrepit scoundrel. That in terms of generalities. Now let's go to the specific case. I never said that I wanted to marry you ... ... don't even want to do it right now. Assuming I wanted to get married ... ... I know a girl who is closer to my idea ... ... ideal wife than you. In fact, there are many, many girls. Whoops! This is my apartment. Get out of here. "This is my apartment. Get out of here." What happened? If you think I'll wait for you to call me and ask for forgiveness ... ... you are very wrong, boy. Have you and Miss Stone Wall Jackson argued? You're still standing, it must have been a Technical KO. Shut up. Open up, okay? It's still early, anyway. Sweets and flowers. There are many girls who will want to be with me. And I will want to be with them. It's Helen. But what happened? ¿Helen? Helen. Helen. - Hi, Charlie. - I wanted to tell you... ... that I appreciate you taking Joe. Is nothing. I thought it would be nice if you and I went out to dinner today. Sorry Charlie. I can not. Why not? Okay... It's actually Joey's fault. - What? - Well, two weeks ago ... ... Joey met a poodle on the corner ... ... from 57 to Second Avenue ... ...Ilamada Florence. Florence has a charming owner named Peter Carruthers. And while Joey knew Florence better , I knew Peter better. And well, last night we decided to get married. Get married? - When? - On Wednesday. On Wednesday? You can still go out with me tonight. Sorry, Charlie, I can't. But I'll be eternally grateful to you and Joey. And of course, as of Wednesday, you will have to take it out for a walk yourself. Goodbye. What is so funny to you? Can't you see that this poor girl is going to marry the owner of a poodle? Poodle owners are terrible husbands. You won't see me sitting here alone tonight. Not this boy. No sir. There are many girls who ... ¿ Western Union? I'd like to send a telegram. Saks Fifth Avenue. Nueva York. When a man pays fifteen dollars for a tie ... ... is it too much to wait for the knot to be properly tied? Fifteen dollars for this tie. Before I bought a suit for fifteen dollars. You do not. You are in no condition to speak to anyone. I don't know why I don't wear a bow tie. - Hi, Poppy. - Joe. Poppy. Poppy, precious. How did you know that the only person I wanted to see was you, precious? Honey, watch out. Watch out. A present for me? You didn't have to. - I had to do it. - Silly stuff. I had enough of your lovely presence. What the hell is this? Charlie, you know my fridge is small. I can't freeze it there. Look at your fridge, 254 liters capacity for four onions. This is your uncle's white fish. No, Charlie, it's your fish. I am delighted to have it. You have been very kind to bring it and I will take good care of you. There's something I want to ask you, Poppy. Are you or are you not the girl ... ... who likes Valencian paella more than anything in the world? It's me. I am that girl. And are you or are you not the girl ... ... who always yells "olé" when he hears guitar music? I'm the girl who does it. Olé. So, you must be the girl who will come with me ... ... to listen to Spanish music and eat Spanish food, right? No. ¿No? Why not? Because I have a date with someone else. He's waiting downstairs. Will he go downtown to buy you espadrilles ... ... and invite you to the Valencian paella? No, he's taking me to Radio City Music Hall ... ... and then, if it's not too late, to the Schrafft. What's wrong? Get rid of that float and let's go. He's going to call me tomorrow. Does that make him a hero? He's polite, Charlie. He's chivalrous. Are you calling me a scoundrel? Of course not. I would never call you a scoundrel. - Scoundrel? - Scoundrel. That's. Thanks a lot. So I guess this is goodbye. Why? - After what did you call me? - Scoundrel? But, my life, I never thought you were something else. Take care of the fish. Goodbye. What are you doing tonight? Where is grace? In just punishment, Charlie. In receiving what you deserve. In which they have returned it to you. For all the calls you promised to return and didn't make. For all the cheeses you didn't eat. For all the girls you caressed and then forgot. You are getting what you deserve. And all in one day. That is the most beautiful thing. What bug bit you, Joe? I am your best friend and I tell you that you are a scoundrel. You are one of the few indecent men I have ever met. Ahead. Give me a punch in the nose. Because I should? Would you punch me back. Also, if I'm so indecent, why does a girl like Sylvia think ...? - Sylvia! - You don't have to call Sylvia. It will arrive in a few minutes. He's coming to pick me up. He said he was homesick. Look, Joe. I am a liberal person. - Not to say worse. - And I'm not at all retrograde. But I don't want you to see Sylvia again. - Why not? - Because you are a married man. Therefore. And Sylvia is a girl who ... Well, he has marriage in mind. You have it? - You have it? - No, but I could think about that. You do not. You have a wife and three children. So stay away from Sylvia. Listen, stupid. Do you want me to get away from Sylvia? So do one thing. Marry her - Marry her? - Yes. She is quite a lady. An incomparable lady, triple distilled, first class. It is not an award to hang in your trophy room. She is a woman to marry. ¿Why do not you leave me alone? All married people are the same. How are you tied ... ... you want everyone else to be. That is your problem, friend. Hi. - Hello. - I'm sorry. I know we don't know each other, but I've seen her somewhere. It's because of my face. It's the one that everyone wears this season. Hi. Hi. - What happens? - Nothing. Look. I haven't known you long, but I know you well. What happens? Charlie and I have argued. Why? For you. - Really? I feel flattered. - He thinks I shouldn't go out with you. It is said by a man who has not called you for two weeks. This is Charlie. I do not get it. For you, everything he does is fine. Why do you allow me to abuse you? You are a beautiful woman, you have talent, you are intelligent ... ... you have everything a man would want. Why do you put up with it? Joe. Dear Joe. As I tell you? We came to this city from Springfield, Des Moines ... ...Fort Worth o Salt Lake City. We are young, beautiful and talented. All we have to do to get married is stay in town. But the guys there don't have what we want. We want something more. A profession, glamor, fun ... ... and this is the ideal place to find it. So we come to New York and we are doing very well. Not great, but pretty good. We forge a profession. We find fun and glamor. Let's go to the premieres. We bought mink stoles. Waiters call us by name. It's fun. It is wonderful. Until one day we realize that we are 33 years old ... ... and we haven't found a man. You can... Joe, do you have any idea what's available for a 33-year-old woman? Married men... ... drunk. Handsome twinks looking for someone to support them. Crazy going for their fifth divorce. What a list, don't you think? That's why we lasso Charlie. He's single, he's attractive ... ... has a job and is reasonably sane. But you don't want it, do you? Has anyone mentioned the word love in this conversation? Sylvia, there are worse things for a girl than not getting married. Name three. Darling, I can't let you throw it all away. Any suggestions, Joe? Sylvia. This is what we have. Salaam, sultan. Sylvia, dear. What happens? I am blind and I am stupid. Joe, you were absolutely right. You have opened my eyes. I know what I have to do. Charlie, what's wrong with you? Here you are, an incomparable lady, triple distilled, first class. What better thing could happen to me in life? What better favor could I do myself? What is this? Sylvia. Marry me. Well you... You will accept, right? Yes. Good. It's already decided. Why are you crying? Do not be alarmed. It is a normal operating procedure. Yes. It's the smartest thing I've ever done. And you know it very well. What kind of celebration is this? She mired in bitter tears and you with that face. Where are the rice and the fireworks? Charlie, I wish you all the luck in the world. Of course. It was your idea. You're good? Won't you cry again? If you think that was crying, wait until you see me at the wedding. Yes, it could happen to me too. Well, this is a joyous event. Yes, there is too much melancholy here. Let's go blind. You have missed me a lot, don't you think? Enjoy a little. How many times have you promised yourself in your life? This is not my party. I'll take it off. A party. That is what we need. It will be the funniest party anyone has ever seen. - A party? -Yes. And we'll start by calling the Dunstocks. Wonderful people, the Dunstocks. She's a little stale, but he's ... Well, he's a little stale too Hello Harry, how are you old pirate? Soy Charlie Reader. Yes, I know, but I've been busy. Take your wife, dress her seductively and come here. Yes. It will be the best party you've ever seen. Who? Sure, bring it. We will feed him. I don't care how many come. Eight? Bring them, great. Goodbye. Well, these are the first. - You will have to buy more onions. - Let's see, who else do we invite? And Danny Fitzpatrick? Is it inside or outside the teal? - Inside. - It's a shame. - She is a great pianist. - You don't have a piano. That wouldn't stop Danny. We have to find some musicians. They are more fun than normal people. - Sol Steiner? - You are a genious. The best thing about Sol is that you know how to locate it. And if he's not there, he's out of town. Is it Curley's bar? Is Sol Steiner there? Yes, I will wait. Sol is in treatment, he 's trying to drink again. Sol, viejo amigo, ¿what are you doing? Would you like to come have a few drinks? To my house. I'm going to get married, that's why. With Sylvia, who else? Listen, can you get in touch with Eddie and Louise? I know they are with you, but can you get in touch with them? Yes, bring them. What? Honey, Fitzpatrick is out. Goodbye to the rental agreement. Yes, bring it too. Great. Goodbye. What? "Who you are?" I'm Charlie Reader, you idiot. Hurry up. If I know the Curley, everyone who is in that joint will come with Sol. Pass me a glass, Joe. Hello dear. I wanted to bring you this little cheese. I called you to tell you. Jessica, this is my fiancee. - Miss Collins, Miss Crewes. - How are you? - What about you? - My fiancee. - You mean you're engaged? -Yes. - To marry? -Yes. - A wedding present. - Thank you. We have a tremendous party tonight and you are invited. Thanks Charlie. But I'm meeting the girls for dinner. - Why don't you bring them with you? - No. We will laugh a lot and go blind. Well, on second thought, yes. Tiger. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. A friend of yours, darling? We will have to go for food since we are going to have a party. With 34 people for dinner? For what? - I'll go buy some things. - Yes, okay. Go buy the appetizers and Joe and I will be opening the bottles. Buy fancy things like caviar, sturgeon, turkey and all that stuff. Taking. Will you have enough with a dollar ? - I'll be back in an hour. - I'll count the minutes. Tiger. There is not enough material for all those gorillas. I will have to buy something. Are you coming with me, Joe? - No. - Okay, okay, Cupid. I'll go alone. - Love you very much. - I love you too. Now I was going to see you to tell you that I love you. And I came to see you to tell you the same thing, darling. Baby, you were right. I need to change. I need to reform. Nerd. I like you just the way you are, more or less. I am the one who has to change. I'm too stubborn and stubborn and ... And why does the meter keep counting? I have already reached my destination. Too stubborn, too inflexible. From now on, we will make concessions. Charlie, honey. Pay the taxi driver and let's go upstairs. We have a lot to talk. Voucher. I will do it. No no no. You have a rehearsal early tomorrow morning. And I'm tired and I'm going to go to bed right away ... ...you do not? I'll call you tomorrow as soon as I get up. Pero, Charlie... ... I love you. I love you too. - Goodbye. Sweet Dreams. - Voucher. Let's go. ¡Eh, eh, Charlie! Oh my God! Charlie, the boyfriend. Congratulations, Mr. Reader. He is engaged to a lovely girl. With two lovely girls. With two. Where did you get the idea that Sue Dunstock was stale? I don't know many girls who let Danny Fitzpatrick ... ... shaved their heads. Who was the girl in the clogs? Because I think I was engaged to her. Sol Steiner. Wow, I thought you weren't even here. You're good? What madness! A crazy party. Crazy. Where's Sylvia? - At home. - What do you mean by "home"? HOME. About home. I do not clarify. She's engaged to Charlie, right? - Yes. - And you keep going home? Without cleaning? He must be crazy if he lets that girl go home. And I don't mean crazy as cool. I'm with you. She is the best. The most. What band do you play in? I play with the Indiana Pharmaceutical Company . What's up friend? Have you lost something? Have you really let Sylvia go home? Hello, Sol. Yes. You shouldn't have allowed it. That girl is nuts. How did you get to be so successful with that Beethoven? I do not know. Didn't you have a rehearsal this morning? Yes, with the Longine Symphonette, with them you must be punctual. They all have watches. - Do you want a drink for the road? - Yes thanks. ¿Joe? Me... There is something I want to tell you. Yes, I also have something to tell you. - Hello Joe. - Hello. Hello Julie. What's wrong? I've been calling you on the phone. Yes? It didn't ring, did it, Joe? - Nerd. - I called you twenty times. Something must happen to the phone. Danny Fitzpatrick. What happened here? Shouldn't you be at rehearsal, honey? What happened here last night? Yeah Charlie, what happened here last night? Nothing. Nothing. Would you like a cup of coffee? You want? - Hi dear. - Hi, Sylvia. ¡Eh! How are you? - Hello Joe. - Hello. What happens to the phone? I tried to call you. Danny Fitzpatrick. - I already remember. - Sylvia, you know Julie, right? Yes, hello. - Honey ... - What brings you here so early? Did you happen to find a diamond earring around here? - Please say yes. - An earring? - Yes. - No. That's terrible. Sue Dunstock has lost her mind. He couldn't contact you and started calling me at seven. And Harry was yelling at him all the time: "Wasn't it enough for you to let that idiot shave your head? Did you also let him remove your earring? " Looks like there was a party here last night. The best of all. He hadn't played hide and seek in years. Was it some kind of celebration? Of course. What kind of celebration? A happy event. Yes. We have to find the earring. What do you mean by a happy event? What is this, Miss Gillis? An interrogation? I have the right to know. - What right? - The right of the bride. Charlie and I got engaged last night. - What? - What? I can't find the earring down here. Shortly after Charlie got engaged to you last night ... ... threw a big party here to announce their engagement. His commitment to Sylvia, that is, not to you. I may be planning to throw another party to announce your engagement. Charlie. That's true? Yes. It is true. Are you engaged? When you kissed me and told me that you loved me? - Were you engaged to another? -Yes. No. I mean, it was and it wasn't. Yes or no. You were or you weren't. You are the most despicable being that ... You are the worst ... I never want to see you again. - You are an evil man. - Julie. I found your shoes. Where were you? In the fridge. Yes... This has been, nevertheless, a memorable day. If I continue with this luck, I will surely be hit by a truck on the way home. I haven't slept at all tonight. Really? I kept thinking that ... I thought that... Well, I was struggling with myself. Who won? Three things kept me awake. First, I couldn't let you marry Charlie. That has already been fixed. The second? Remember when I told you not to marry Charlie? And you asked me what you could do? - Yes. - Well, I know. I love you, Sylvia. I love you from the first moment I saw you. I want you to marry me. What was the third thing that kept you awake? How to tell Ethel. I will have to write you a long letter. Wouldn't it be more manly to tell her face to face? That would be too manly. Well, there is always the phone. Right now? Is there a better time? It's Sunday. There is a reduced rate all day. You are laughing at me? No. Absolutely. Agree. Agree. I'll call her now. We had forgotten. Danny Fitzpatrick cut the cord. What if you go to the corner store? There are many phones. And if you don't have enough coins, you can call collect. Yes, but ... What's up, Joe? Do you want to marry me, but not enough to go to the store? Is not that. But something like this, out of nowhere ... I don't want to startle Ethel. Understand me... ... Ethel thinks I love her. And you want it. Joe, dear. I tell you something? You think you love me because I'm so much like Ethel. Are you like Ethel? I want a carpeted house and French Provencal furniture ... ... and a house full of children, all with straight teeth. What did you think I wanted? Moonbeams? Dinner by candlelight? The seventh heaven? Joe, do you know what you've got? You have the dream of any married man. You want a girl. That's all you want, a girl. And that you can never have because ... ... the only way to have a girl is not to marry her. Because then she becomes your wife. And it is already completely different. No, Sylvia, with you it would be different. Joe. Ask me another question. Ask me if I love you. I like you, Joe. I like you a lot. But I don't love you On behalf of this Indiana guest , thank you. He has closed the door of the taxi in my hand. I guess it's your turn now, Sylvia. Charlie. Some girls might think ... ... that ours was not the most romantic request for a hand in history. Some girls might even say ... ... that our entire relationship left a lot to be desired. To tell the truth, I am one of those girls. What can I say, Sylvia? Saying "I'm sorry" would only add insult to injury. What can I say? That I am the most rogue in history? You might be glad to know ... ... that, right now, I'm the most unhappy scoundrel ever I know you are, Charlie. And I'm sorry. I'm not happy. Perhaps, you are the most wonderful woman in this world ... ... or from any other world. I agree. It was bad luck not to have fallen in love with you and marry you ... ... and let you make me happy. I had to fall in love with Julie. I love her. She's crazy, but I love her. So don't settle for someone other than Julie. Don't be content with the second best. I know one thing. There will be no second best for me ever again. I'm going to find a really good man ... ... looking for a really good woman . Somewhere in this great city, there has to be one. Thank you for a beautiful proposal. Sorry to interrupt, but I think this belongs to you. Someone threw it on my deck last night. Whoever it is, I have enough problems. I'm not angry. I just wanted to say that when you have a party, invite me. I love revelry. Hi. You no longer have to go out for dinner. Goodbye Charlie. Goodbye, guest. Bye, Sylvia. Thank you. Where the hell were you twelve years ago? Sorry. I guess you can't expect good service on Sundays. Don't you play on NBC? Yes. That's what he remembered her about. I never miss a show. You mean you recognized me from the show? Violin section. But we only went out three or four times during the show. Forget that you are the only woman in that section. Besides being the most striking, if I may say so. Thank you. I don't see any reason why it shouldn't. Tell me, the next concert is Wednesday, right? - Yes. - I think I'll buy a ticket. Do you know the question about people with beards? That is, do they sleep with their beards under or over the blanket? I also wonder about the musicians. Do you eat before or after a concert? Because I was wondering if, after the concert on Wednesday ... Where are you going? At home. Indianapolis. The gateway to the West. And you leave me here alone? ¿Solo? In the morning you will have the phone fixed. And in the afternoon you will be buried ... ... in white fish and strange Wisconsin cheeses. I don't want white fish. I don't want strange cheeses from Wisconsin. And I don't want Poppy, Jessica, or Miss Snr. I just want Julie. - You already know my idea of ​​paradise, Joe? - What? To be so in love with a girl and that she loves you so much ... ... that you don't think about resting from her for eleven years. Eleven years. I have a dog there that has straight teeth. You don't need gadgets. You don't even have to brush them. Would you trade it for your kids, Joe? No, unless you include some gold bars in the change. And you know what I mean. Sorry Charlie. Okay. I must hurry if I want to catch the one at three. Couldn't you at least stay for dinner with me? I would like. But then it wouldn't be until one. And I don't want Ethel to drive to the airport at that time. He wouldn't have to. You could take a taxi. Yes, but she likes to pick me up. And now that I remember, I also like him to pick me up. Yeah, you better take the one at three. Goodbye friend. Thanks for everything. Goodbye, Joe. Give best regards to the family. Voucher. Write to us. How long will it take me to see you again, Joe? About eleven years. Goodbye friend. I was forgetting Ethel and the children. VARIETIES FILMS PRAISED BY THE PUBLIC CHARLIE READER IS BACK New York, March 12.
