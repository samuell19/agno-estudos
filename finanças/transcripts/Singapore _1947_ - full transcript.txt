Please fasten your seatbelts. We're landing in three minutes. Well, there is your Singapore. The crossroads of the world. The star of the orient. Will you please fasten your seatbelts. The romance and adventure of far-flung places. That's a lot of press agent's .. What's the word they use over here for a lot of talk? Walla walla. That's it. Thank you, Mr Gordon. A lot of press agent's Walla walla. I love that word. [ Tannoy: ] "All passengers just arriving on Flight 22 from Manilla." "Please report to the incoming desk." "And have your passports ready to be checked." Your passport, please. Thank you. "Far East Airways Flight 9 from Calcutta and Rangoon." "Will arrive at Gate 2 in fifteen minutes." The touring car will take you to your hotel. Couldn't we take a rickshaw? I can't wait to ride in one. You will have the opportunity. Tomorrow we visit the Palace of Johore and the botanical garden. Walla walla. Bellows, we pick you up at 8 sharp. - In the morning? - Yes, sir. The cool of the day. Excuse me. Mr Gordon? That's right. - Can you please step this way. "Netherlands East Indies Flight 1." "For Batavia and Surabaya." "Ready at Gate 1." Mr Gordon must have influential friends. Can he get us out of this line? - No. I'm sorry. Well. A reception committee. I thought these old eyes were failing me seeing your name on the passenger list. I can't quite say "welcome" Gordon. You know, I hoped you would have forgotten my existence, Mr Hewitt. How could I? I was always sorry the war interrupted our relationship. It promised to be delightful. That's the trouble with history. It does not leave any time for sentiments. You don't mind if I sit down? - No, of course not. How is the pearl business? Same little misunderstandings. My cargoes are nothing but copra. The pearls were just, one might call it, a super-cargo, eh? Pipe dreams, Mr Hewitt? No, but .. It doe smell its way about. Why did you come back? Leave something behind? Well, I wanted to see Singapore again. Find out what had happened to it. I always loved it. A one-sided love? Passport? "Flight Number 7 arriving at Gate 2." "Matthew Gordon. Lieutenant, United States Naval Reserve." "Commander motor torpedo boat 921, Solomon Islands, New Guinea." "Silver Star batter of Surabaya Straights." Very good. "Certificate of Satisfactory Service 1946." Excellent. You should have been very useful. You know those waters like a native. Where did you find those oyster beds? Off Labuan, North Borneo? Copra. Are you going to buy another schooner? No. Well, anyway. "Summary of regulations, Malay States." "Section 211." Here it is. "Any person or persons convicted of removing pearls at sea." "And disposing of shell or taking such pearls into or out of a British colony." "Shall be subject to a minimum of ten years imprisonment." Well, before the war, it was only eight. But I guess everything has gone up, huh. Anything else? - No. Have a good visit. Thanks. "Flight Number 10 now loading." Oh. If you should happen to want me for anything, I'm staying at the same hotel. Have a pleasant visit. Mr Gordon. Cadum. It's good to see you again. - It's good to see you, Cadum. You had a rocky time? I was in a concentration camp but that's passed. A suite? - You haven't forgotten have you. I'd like my old one if I can have it. Oh yes. 202. I am sorry. That was already reserved for Mr and Mrs Bellows. Well, I'm afraid I haven't another suite but I can put you next door. At 200. Let's go. That will be fine, Cadum. Thanks. Boy, will you take my things up to the room. Leave the key at the desk. "It was five long years since I'd been here." "But nothing was changed." "From every corner memories came back to me." "Things I hoped I'd forgotten." "It almost seemed that I'd returned to Singapore just to see this bar again." Table near the window, sir? No, thanks. This one will do. You wish something, sir? Yeah. Two gin slings. Two? Yes, sir. "This had been our table. Linda's and mine." "She called it 'the hideout' as it was by itself and just big enough for two." "It felt strange to be sitting here alone now." "Linda Grahame." "We'd known each other only a short time. Then the war came." [ Ship's horn! ] My boat. I must go now. - They give three warnings. I always loved that sound. Today I hate it. I hate it too. Oh, why can't I stay with you? Darling, we've been through that. There's a war on. It's the last ship. We may never see each other again. Don't forget me. How could I? There's so many things to remember. All crowded into this one short week. Unforgettable things. Your hands. And the way you hold me. And your eyes. The way I have to stand on my toes to kiss you. I'll remember you. Just as you are. All of you. Please, let's say goodbye here. No. I want to be with you as long as I can. Watch you go up the gangplank. Watch the ship sail. Watching. Until there is nothing. [ Ship's horn! ] Waiter. "All passengers please be sure to have your tickets to board the ship." Your baggage is in cabin, Missy. And many flowers. All from Tuan Gordon. I wish I could take you with me, Ming Ling. Missy is so kind. Perhaps I'll come back after the war and visit you. Here. Take this just to remind you of me. Goodbye, Ming Ling. - Goodbye, Missy. Goodbye, Matt. Come soon. As soon as you can. - I will, darling. Goodbye. [ Ship's horn! ] "The moment she had gone I felt alone." "More alone than I'd ever been in my life." "And I wanted her back." "I wanted her desperately." This way, madam. Give me the desk, please. Cadum? This is Matt Gordon. I'd like a room for a lady. Yes. Miss Linda Grahame. But only for a day or so and then we'll be moving in together. I know, Cadum. It's alright now. No, it's alright. We're .. We're getting married. Yes. Thanks, Cadum. He says he hopes we'll be happy. He should know how happy. Is that the way you propose? Yep. I accept. Hold it. Light out, remember. Doesn't it seem strange seeing her out there? All alone. - Yeah. Regrets? - Uhuh. There is someone on board I miss terribly. Who? The steward who has my baggage. All my alluring clothes. - I'm glad they've gone. They knew you longer than I did. And much more intimately. Tomorrow you can buy anything you want. Oh, are you a rich man? - I'm a pirate. There is a treasure buried in that room. Under the floor? - That's too easy. It's in the ceiling. If nobody else finds it we'll have a fortune. Oh, that's bad. Why? I've a friend at home. A girlfriend, darling. She is two weeks older than I am and consequently much more experienced. She once told me that if I ever met man that tells me he loves me. That I should make him spend all his money. Ruin him. Just to make sure he means it. So let me ruin you fast. How will I be ruined? - You're my last victim, darling. [ Singing: ] "Onward Christian soldiers." "Marching as to war." There was a little chapel like this behind our house. I used to go there after my mother and father died. It was high upon a hill and I could see for miles. I used to search the horizon and .. Wonder what was ahead for me. The roads below were like white, winding threads. People and cars seemed like black dots. Each one separate and alone. Just as I was. But not anymore. "With the cross of Jesus." "Going on before." There now, that's all for today, children. Run along, put on your vestments. It will time soon, for services. I'm sorry to bother you on a Sunday sir, but we'd .. Did you wish to make arrangements for a wedding? How could you tell? - That wasn't difficult to guess. Emily, you had better help the children. These young people seem to be in a hurry. Will you come and sit down. Now. Your names, date and place of birth. Matthew Gordon. April 26 1910. Brooklyn. Linda Grahame. September 11 1919. Rochester, New York. I was once in Brooklyn. Why didn't I see you? I was probably in Rochester trying to find you. Linda Gra .. - Grahame. G-r-a-h-a-m. G-r-a-h-a-m-e. There is an E on the end. - There is? Yes, darling. - What do you know. You've both been baptised, I suppose? Have you ever been married before? No, sir. - No. Same. You two haven't known each other very long, have you? It's our ninth day. Oh, I see. Now will you please sign. Here. And here. You understand you are just signing the notice of intention to marry? You have to wait three weeks for the banns to be posted. Three weeks? Well. It will give you time to get better acquainted. Thomas. Thomas! They just said over the radio that an important announcement is coming. Everyone should stand by. [ Radio: ] "Attention! Attention!" "News has just been released .." "That Penang has been bombed by two flights of Japanese aircraft." "Japanese ground forces have invaded the northern part of the peninsula." "All military personnel .." "And local defence corps are requested to report to stations at once." "This announcement will be repeated every five minutes." "We knew it was coming." Thomas, what are we going to do? When it comes, make the best of it. Under the circumstances sir, would it be possible for us to be married sooner? Please, couldn't you forget the regulations? Just for once? I feel so far as the church is concerned it might be arranged. Be here a week from Friday. In the evening. And don't forget the ring and two witnesses. God bless you. - Thank you. [ Singing: ] "Silent night." "Holy night." "All is calm." "All is bright." "Round yon virgin, mother and child." "Holy infant, so tender and mild." "Even under the threat of a Japanese attack we celebrated Christmas." "The following evening we were going to be married." Shall we get our presents and open them under the tree? Would you rather? - No. Too many people. I think so too. We'll have our own. Well darling, where ..? Has nobody ever told you, Sascha? You wear too much perfume. - Please. Don't tear my shirt. The material is irreplaceable. The balcony has an amazing view. You will be able to watch the Japs when they attack. I'll try not to be here. They may be here sooner than you think. They are not so very far away. What a pity. The government can't turn those large naval guns to shoot inland. That would make such a remarkable noise. Sascha here is an expert on everything. Especially other people's belongings. Don't say that. I just came here to tell you that .. Mr Mauribus still expects your visit. I haven't got time but give him my regards, will you. He'll be very disappointed. I must apologise for having interrupted such a charming .. T?te-?-t?te. Sascha. Haven't you forgotten something? Did I? Oh yes. Merry Christmas. It might burn that irreplaceable shirt. You are very thoughtful. Mr Gordon. Goodnight. A charming fellow. Merry Christmas, darling. - Matt, what did he mean? Who is Mr Mauribus? - Oh .. Santa Claus. Alright. Keep your secrets. Here. You open your present first. Do you know what it is? - Yes, it's Burmese. A Myanmar talisman. One life. One love. Thanks, darling. Hey come on. Now open yours. Do you like them? They must have cost a fortune. - No, I got them for nothing. One day I was hungry so I ordered some oysters. A hundred oysters. I was pretty hungry. When I opened them, what did I find? In each one there was a little pearl. Wasn't that lucky? You fished for each one of these from your schooner. You're learning, darling. You used to say "boat". May I? I am experienced in opening locks. Beautiful. Perfectly matched. You know we always think of you Gordon in connection with pearls. And then Miss Grahame .. Who has spent every moment with you since her arrival in Singapore. Appears with this remarkable necklace. It's, how shall I say it? An arresting coincidence. Very arresting. Are you trying to imply that he stole it? Not exactly. The correct term would be "smuggled". For your information, I bought that necklace in America. In New York. May I ask where? - You May. Brett & Langworts. It has a clasp of Malayan manufacture. Brett & Langworts import jewellery from all over the world. Undoubtedly .. you'll forgive me if I check with them by cable? No, I won't. But don't let that stop you. I admire your frankness, Miss Grahame. Thank you. Now may I have my necklace back? It's yours. For the moment. It will be a pity to lock it in a vault. It looked beautiful on you last night. Yes, I know. It is very becoming. May we go now? Of course. Sorry to have inconvenienced you. But we have to clean things up, with the Japanese nearly knocking on our gates. Besides .. I've had an affectionate interest in Mr Gordon for too long to give up now. You will find that my interest in Mr Gordon is just as affectionate as yours. Merry Christmas. You were perfect. - Matt. Yes, I smuggled them. Now that it's mine, can I do what I want with it? Sure. And I'll give it to Hewitt, so he won't bother us anymore. That won't stop him. What else can he want? A little bag of loose pearls worth a quarter of a million dollars. Where are they hidden? In you room? That's what Hewitt would like to know. Can't you sell them without smuggling them? For a fourth as much. Does that make it worth the danger? - Maybe that's what I like about it. Have you planned to do that all your life? Well, plans change. Kind of a plan to get married. But I'll be married in half an hour. Will he arrest us? - No. Anyway, not you. You see, you don't know where they are. Well, where is my best man? Come on! The military just occupied your hotel. "I told Linda to wait for me." "I knew I shouldn't have left the pearls." "I'd run so much risk to get them and .." "To keep them." "I had to get back to my hotel." I'll hurry, darling. "When I reached the hotel enemy planes were already over the city." "But I didn't turn back." "The pearls had become an obsession. I had to have them." Sorry, sir. [ Radio: ] "The second Japanese force is landing at Ubin Island." "Defence lines are being formed at Seletar Aerodrome." "Calling local defence force." Zeros. One .. two .. "They were still there." "Near .. but there was nothing I could do." Your room, old chap? - Yes, but .. It's alright, I'll come back later and get my things. It will probably be much later. If there is anything left of it. Ming Ling. Where is she? Where is she? "When I came to we searched for hours everywhere." "Until there was no hope left." "When we finally went back to my schooner, I .." "I knew Linda was dead." Are you Mr Gordon? Yes. Would you take my wife and children with you? If you haven't room for me, it doesn't matter. Yes, I'll take them. Get aboard, all of you. "I never meant to see Singapore again, but now five years later, I'm back." "But not for memories." "A quarter of a million dollars' worth of pearls would bring anyone back." I hate to disturb your reverie. It is nice to have you back in Singapore again. Oh Mr Gordon, isn't this a lovely hotel. The view from our balcony is simply enchanting. But those sawed-down dink-pots they call bathtubs have bumps on the bottom. I'd like to join you. Mrs Bellows wants to see the town. I just can't wait to meet the orient. Come along, Gerald. Tourists. The Japs were here four years and didn't kill you off, huh? Oh, they were very pleased with me. I knew where all the hidden wealth was. And told them - Oh no. I just gave them a few second-grade trinkets from time to time. To keep them happy. Won't you join me? - No thanks. Before I forget. Mr Mauribus wants to see you. Oh, is he still around too? - Oh yes. He has something that belongs to you. What? How should I know? Good afternoon. - Hello. One moment, please. It's alright. Mauribus is expecting me. Ah, Mr Gordon. Come in. Come in my friend. Sit here by my desk. This is indeed an honour. Your boy Sergeant tells me you're holding something for me. What is it? - Don't be so impatient. Have you an American cigarette? Thank you. Well, I see you haven't forgotten. You are looking very well. How was your war? Very absorbing. How was yours? - Oh, not too bad. I like troubled times. They keep the police occupied. Looks like they're back in business. But I'm not. I'm just a tourist now, Mauribus. I came back to Singapore for sentimental reasons. No, Gordon. You came back to get a quarter million dollars worth of pearls you left behind. You have quite an imagination. No. Just a logical mind. You were at sea in 1941 for five months from August to December. Your harvest must have been good. But strangely, you took no pearls with you when you left here. You figured that all out, huh? You were kind enough to evacuate a group of refugees. Among them was an acquaintance of mine. He found nothing. There was no fishing during the war. Pearls are very scarce. I am willing to buy yours, at a price. But I do mean to have them. There aren't any. I brought back nothing but copra. Copra? Here is a sample of your "copra". You remember this necklace? Where did you get it? - From a burnt-out mission. A friend of mine found it the night you left Singapore. You remember that mission, don't you? There was much confusion that night. Some people died during the bombing. I know. Unfortunately the wrong ones. I would gladly give you this as a souvenir. When you sell me the other pearls, the ones I know you have hidden. No deal. And stop bothering me. I'm not going to be here long and I've quit being sociable. Mr Gordon. Singapore is a very interesting city. You will be here longer than you think. Sascha. Mr Gordon doesn't want to be sociable. - Ah .. We do. Watch him closely. Did you use my bottle of perfume? The one I bought at the bazaar. Did I what? My bottle of perfume. I left it here in this drawer. Were you using it? I haven't used perfume since the day I proposed to you. Sometimes I wish I hadn't. I remember. You were so romantic. Perhaps the maid moved it. Why don't you ask her? I don't care if something is missing. We're insured. Ahh! I did again! Of all the .. Didn't they ever hear of using a pipe to take the water from there to over here. Going all over the floor. Look at that mess. Darling, it's the little inconveniences that make the orient so interesting. Hurry up and get dressed. I don't want to be late. Where you dragging me to tonight? To the Chinese Theatre. Mr Gordon says it?s a must. They are giving Hamlet. - Hamlet. In Chinese. Are your rooms comfortable? Outside of the bathtub I mean. Oh perfect. We have a lovely suite. The reason I ask is that I lived in it for some time before the war. It .. holds a lot of memories for me. I imagine it is pretty much the same as it was, isn't it? That is, it could still use a few coats of paint. And how. Our plaster is about to fall off. Maybe they leave it that way to please the women. Mrs Bellows calls it "quaint". I think I agree with Mrs Bellows. You wouldn't if you had to sit in one of her antique chairs. I've fallen through four times. - Oh, Gerald. Mr Gordon, are you familiar with the temple in South Bridge Road? Oh yes. And it is a must for every tourist. There, Gerald. What did I tell you. I don't care if it is far. We're going there tomorrow. They say, once you hear the local people put on a wonderful religious ceremony. They walk on a heaving bed of fire. That's a quaint thing to do. Linda. Linda. Oh, were you speaking to me? You don't know me? I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't. I think you are confusing my wife with someone else. I guess so. I beg your pardon. That's quite alright. So sorry. Pardon me. What is the name of the gentleman with the lady in the white dress? They are just sitting down at the second table. Yes, sir. Mr and Mrs Van Leyden. He owns a plantation in Medan. They are guests of Mr Lew Chin. Head of the Empire Bank. Thanks. Good morning, sir. - Is Mrs Van Leyden home? Your name, sir? - Matt Gordon. I'm an old friend of hers. Step in, please. Wait in there. I will announce you. Pardon me, madam. A Mr Gordon to see you. - Gordon? I don't know anyone .. - He said he's an old friend. Oh. I didn't think I recognised the name. You spoke to me last night. Look, Linda. There is no-one around now. What's the matter? What's happened to you? My name isn't Linda. What kind of a game is this? Why don't you want to know me? You must be mistaken. I've never heard of Linda. Linda Grahame. With an "E" on the end. Doesn't that sound familiar? I'm sorry, I'm afraid it doesn't. Maybe I can refresh your memory. We met here in Singapore five years ago. You had servant named Ming Ling. Ming Ling? You've forgotten her too, huh? And I suppose you don't remember Commissioner Hewitt either? I've met Commissioner Hewitt but he never called me Linda. Ann! Yes, Michael? Come along, my darling. We're waiting for you to play doubles. Oh, I beg your pardon. This is Mr Gordon. My husband Michael Van Leyden. How do you do. - Hello. We sort of met last night. - That's right. Michael. Mr Gordon insists that I'm someone else. A "Miss Grahame". Or is "Mrs"? It is "Miss". Obviously a case of mistaken identity. But Mr Gordon says .. - Ann, can I speak to you a moment? Yes of course. - Will you excuse us? Certainly. Well darling, we knew something like this might happen one day, didn't we. Yes. We talked about it so often. I thought I'd be prepared but .. Now that it has happened, it's quite a shock. To see someone who says he knows me. Mentions names, people. And not to be able to remember. It's like hearing about a stranger. Linda Grahame. She is a stranger, Ann. But he may be able to help us, Michael. He seems to be sincere. Perhaps he is. The point is, do we want to find out? I don't know. I'm so mixed up. Darling. Have you been happy with me? Yes. You know that. Well there is your answer. We don't have to know about the past. Would it make any difference to you? Perhaps. It might make a lot of difference to both of us. I rather expected this visit. So I thought I'd try and find out who Mr Gordon was. I did. From the police. They are very interested in him. Do you trust me? More than myself. Thank you, darling. Now let me handle this alone will you. Sorry to keep you waiting. Mrs Van Leyden sends her apologies. That's understandable. - You knew my wife before the war? Yes, I knew her. And you're still concerned about her? - Sure, I'm concerned about her. What's wrong with her? Why can't she remember me? Mr Gordon, she remembers none of her past. She only recalls her life from the time she woke in hospital after an air-raid. So that's what happened. - Hmm. We met in that hospital. We were three years in a prison camp. We were married. We built a whole new life. She is happy and I want her to remain that way. But how can she be happy if she doesn't remember the greater part of her life? Maybe the best part. What kind of happiness is that? I don't think I made myself clear, Mr Gordon. I don't care to know about my wife's past. Well maybe you don't, but I do. I think it is up to her to decide what part of her life she wants to remember. And what part she wants to forget. Anything else, Mr Gordon? No. Not for the moment. If she's the best you can find, I'll take her. I don't think you will regret your choice, Mr Gordon. When can you have the papers ready? It won't take long. Get me a good crew and supplies for three months. Are you going into trading again? No. The sea is a good place to get your health back. You don't look sick. I'm not. [ Telephone ] Police Headquarters. Desk. Yes. That's what we're here for. Who? Mrs Van Leyden. I am trying to locate the address of a woman named "Ming Ling". Well, I'm not sure. Chinese I suppose. Can you give us a description? You can't. Well, that makes it a little difficult. Do you know at least who she works for? Linda. Grahame. Oh .. before the war. Well, we'll do our best, Mrs Van Leyden. Your telephone number? If we learn anything, we'll call you. Thank you very much. [ Chinese language ] Ming Ling? You know Rock Canal? [ Chinese language ] You know Ming Ling? Mrs Grahame! Mrs Grahame! Mrs Grahame! I thought you dead. Ming Ling? Ming Ling. Yes. So happy. Remember? You give to me. Always wear it. Always. [ Chinese language ] Come in house. My house. I'm married, Missy Grahame. Have beautiful babies. It is boy. A son. He's beautiful. Beautiful, yes. There are two things I can rely on, my appetite and my instinct. Gordon came back for the pearls. They must be hidden in his old room in the hotel. Then why hasn't he made the slightest effort to find if they are still there? Because somebody else has that room now .. And he's smart enough to know he's being watched. By us and by Hewitt. As far as I can see. His only interest is in that lady. Who now calls herself Van Leyden. Ah, that's sentiment. The pearls are business. Maybe the two are connected? Come in, Pepe. Pepe and I used to work together. Before I joined you in big business. Pepe's had a conference with Mr Gordon. Oh? What about? I'm a loyal man, Mr Mauribus. What's in it for me if I talk? Twice as much as if you don't. - That's two hundred. First. Be disloyal. I'm in the business of manufacturing official papers. Unofficially, of course. Mr Gordon wants an American passport for a lady. The name is "Grahame". He wants to take her on a voyage. With or without her consent. And when does this "voyage" take place? Mr Gordon has to make certain arrangements. That's all he told me. Could I .. And if you want anything else .. Sascha knows where to find me. With or without her consent? Interesting. Very. Call Mr Gordon. He is in the writing room. You will find her at the bar. We'll .. take care of this later. Hello. I wasn't sure I'd find you here at this hour. Won't you sit down. How did you happen to pick this table? I don't know. It's quiet. Why? I just wondered. Your favourite drink? Gin Sling, yes. We always have them at home. At the plantation. Nothing for me. I saw Ming Ling. - You did? It was difficult finding her, but the police helped me. She too says I'm Linda Grahame. What else did she tell you? Not very much. You see .. I didn't go to find out about me. I wanted to find out .. about us. Now I know. - And you remember? It was like .. Like hearing a story about someone I didn't know. Someone who is dead. - Alright. If Linda is dead, do you let her be dead? We're alive, you and I. We're sitting here. It's the same table, the same drink. Just as it was five years ago. Can't you see it doesn't make any difference if you remember or not? If I'd never known you. If I'd seen you today for the first time. I'd love you just as I did before. Can't you see that? And it's got to be the same with you. Isn't it? Answer me. Oh, I wish I could, but .. There is no answer. There can't be. Because you're married? - Yes. There is no happiness if it means hurting someone else. Didn't my husband tell you how we met? He said you .. were both interned. During the whole war. I was lonelier than anyone else. You see, I didn't even have any memories. The present was completely empty. Cut off from everything. Without Michael, there would have been no future. You want me to keep out of it? Is that what you want to say? You can only be someone I met .. Two days ago. I must go now. I won't see you again. We are returning to the plantation. What are your plans? They are .. They changed in the last five minutes. Whatever they are. I wish you good luck. Thanks. Goodbye. Please let me go alone. - Just one thing more. I want to give this back to you. One life .. one .. Can we send your bags to the airport? - We'll finish packing in a few hours. Mr Gordon. What luck. We were hoping to see you to say goodbye. When are you leaving? - In the morning. In the midst of the dawn, so to speak. - 5am. I'd like to meet the maniac who thinks up tourist schedules. Look, whenever you come to Minneapolis look us up. Bellows and Sons. Plumbing fixtures. Well, if we don't see you again .. You'll be seeing me. I'm leaving on the same plane. - Oh, really? Gerald, what a wonderful coincidence. Yes, isn't it. Mr Bellows? Excuse me. The tour is leaving in two hours. Thank you. We have one last temple to see. It's got a gold plated roof. Gold leaf, Gerald. I still say asbestos shingles are cheaper and better. Come along, Gerald. We have to finish our packing. I'm so tired I can't stand on my feet. All this packing and now you drag me to another temple. If only you hadn't broken that Chinese vase. I'm not a packer, I'm just a plumber. The service department. Hello. This is Mr Bellows in 202. The ceiling fan in my room has stopped working and it's unbearably hot. Send a boy up to fix it and make it quick. Just a minute. There's somebody at the door. Come in. Go ahead, Mrs Thorne. What was that? Yeah. Wait just a minute. I can't hear what you're saying. Boy. I'm talking to New York. You're making so much noise I can't hear a thing. Will you get out and come back in half an hour? Just leave the ladder where it is. Yeah. Go ahead Mrs Thorne. Is Mr Gordon in? Yes, Commissioner. Should I ..? - No, no. I want to make it a surprise. His room is 200? - That's right. Gordon? [ Telephone ] Hello Commissioner. - Homesick for your old room? No, I was .. Saying goodbye to some American friends of mine. Just a social call. In your shirt sleeves? You and your British formalities. Your friends must have left by the window. Come on, Gordon. Let's have the pearls. - Pearls? I don't know what you're talking about, Hewitt. It fits. - May we take your luggage, sir? Sure. Alright with me. Just a minute. Let's go to your room. Why don't you look for the pearls in here? They might be under the mattress. - Forget them for the moment, Gordon. I have a few questions. Go ahead. You'll find me as talkative as an oyster. I hear you've met the Van Leydens? That's right. She was here in the bar with earlier this afternoon. Yeah. Did she seem alright when she left? Certainly. Why? Because she never got home. What do you mean, she never got home? She was expected at two o'clock. It's now five and still no trace of her. I thought you might know something about it. No, I don't. Perhaps not. How did she leave here? In a taxi? I don't know. I was in the bar. Any ideas? I don't like this, Gordon. If you find out anything, call my office. Deputy Commissioner Hewitt's office. Thank you. Tilson back from the docks? - No, sir. Any word on Mrs Van Leyden? - Not yes, sir. Did you find him? - Yes. He was at the hotel. Well, why didn't you bring him in? - He had nothing to do with it. Anyway, that's what he said. And you take his word? When you tell me he's a criminal and a smuggler? He's a gambler, like most Americans. He smuggled because he loves the risk. And trying to make a fool out of me is an added pleasure. You make him sound very romantic. - Where are you going? If you can't get the truth out of him, I'm going to. You won't find him at the hotel. If I judge Gordon rightly, he is just as anxious to find your wife as we are. Did he tell you why Ann went to see him? No. But I can guess. Mrs Van Leyden enquired at headquarters yesterday about Ming Ling's address. Ming Ling was Linda Grahame's servant. Well, they didn't give it to her? - Why not? That's their job. Come in. Hello, Johnston - Mr Hussein. How do you do. Mr Hussein tells me that Gordon commissioned him to buy a schooner. Really? Did he give any reason? No, sir. I asked him if he was going into trading again. He said no. Nothing else said? He did make a joke. He said the sea was a good place to get one's health back. I said he didn't look sick. He said he wasn't. There. You have it. Ann's health. Her mental health. That's all he could have meant. And you say he wasn't planning to take her away. That's all, Mr Hussein. Thank you. Goodnight, Commissioner. Now are you convinced? You've got to stop him. Bring Gordon in. - Yes, sir. If he is not at the hotel, send out a general order. Yes, sir. Hello Khan. - Good evening, Tuan Gordon. You would like drink? - No. I've been looking for you, Pepe. Why do you think I'm paying you? Where is she? I don't know what you're talking about, Mr Gordon. You told me to wait. Who did you tell about the passport? I pay you to keep your mouth shut. Who paid you more? Was it Mauribus? Come on, was it? Where have they taken her? I don't know. They didn't tell me. I swear I don't know. You've got to tell the truth! Where did he hide those pearls? I don't know. I can't remember. I can't remember anything. What do you say, Jimmy? - Mr Gordon. Long-time not have the pleasure. - I've been away. Give me a pipe. Has Sascha Barda been around? He does not come here anymore. - No? He used to like the place. Now he is part owner of the Macau Cabaret. The Macau, huh? Coming up in the world. That's alright. - Thank you. But I told you I've not seen it before. - You're lying! You were in his room the night I tried to steal it. Monsieur? You're new here aren't you? - Oui, Monsieur. My name is Gordon. I have an appointment with Mr Barda. - Monsieur Barda is not in. But he may be here later? Monsieur Barda might not come at all tonight. I'll take a chance. Do you have a quiet place where I could wait? What do you wish, Monsieur? I want to talk to Barda. Send him up as soon as he gets here. Come in. Don't you recognise this necklace? It belongs to you. I saw you wear it. You'd better remember soon. Or you won't be able to remember anything. Ever again! What did he do with those pearls? Sascha. - Hmm? The young lady is loyal to her friend. Let her see if her friend will be loyal to her. I am sorry dear lady. But as they say in your country. Business is business. Where did he hide those pearls? Why, Mr Gordon. I never expected this honour. Skip the preliminaries, Sascha. You know why I'm here. To bring the pearls, perhaps? Mr Mauribus will be so pleased. He always said you'd listen to reason. You smell good, Sascha, but you're not very bright. Not very bright and not very fast. Now come on, I want my share. - What share? Of the pearls you stole. Now don't tell me you didn't. I didn't. I didn't Mr Gordon. Really I didn't. Don't lose your temper, Mr Gordon. I'm sure we can settle this peacefully. Okay, Mauribus. I see your point. Take his gun. You shouldn't have hit me. What makes you think we have the pearls? Alright. You want to play games? You got them from the fan in my room where I hid them. You can keep them. All I want is my cut. - I would gladly pay you, Mr Gordon. Unfortunately, through the inefficiency of my associate. I am unable to do so. We have no pearls. Somebody else .. - Nobody else knew where they were! Except one person and she .. Hey, wait a minute. Many gentlemen make the mistake of trusting the lady of the moment. That's why she disappeared. That's why she was so scared when I met her again. Only this afternoon, she came to find out if I was suspicious of anything. Sascha, you're not the only fool in this room. Thanks for the tip. I'll get her. I'll show her who is the .. I can save you the trip. The lady is here. She is here? I don't believe it. A difficult man to convince. Well, you're better than I thought. They asked me about pearls. This man showed me a necklace. What do they want of me? What do they want of you? How long has she given you this? - 2 hours. I won't take that long to find out. Just let me alone with her. I prefer to watch the proceedings. Alright. Come on honey, spill it. So you wanted the pearls for yourself, huh? Or did you promise your husband to keep quiet? Is he in on the deal? Come on. I don't want to beat it out of you but you're asking for it. Come on, talk! [ Buzzer ] Get Mr Van Leyden. What happened? She's had a bad fall. Better call a doctor. - I'll take her. Call Dr Craig. - Yes, sir. Gordon, I owe you an apology. For a moment I thought that she was .. - Forget it. Where was she? - You'll get a police report. I'll just wait around and find out what the doctor has to say. She's had rather a nasty fall. But no real damage. She shouldn't have been unconscious all this time though. Has she been under any emotional strain? Shock? Yes, I'm afraid she has. In a kind of a coma. Nothing to worry about though. It will pass. Well, that's all I can do now. Well, stop in tomorrow. You keep that arm of yours in a sling for a couple of weeks, Mr Gordon. Well, that's that. I guess I won't see you again, Hewitt. I leave Singapore on the 5 o'clock plane. Good hunting. Goodbye, Van Leyden. Gordon, I would like to say that .. - No speeches if you don't mind. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Matt. Ming Ling, look outside. Matt. There, my darling. Don't be frightened. Oh, it's you, Michael. There is no fire? No bombs? No. Everything is quiet. Where is Matt? Matt Gordon. I saw him again, didn't I? Yes. I knew someday he would come back. I'd like to see him, Michael. Just for a moment. - He's leaving. But I must see him. I'll phone the airport. No. Don't. Perhaps it's better this way. You love him, don't you. I know you do. Michael. Don't ask me now. It's all so sudden. Things I remember now. Are all the things that have happened in the past few days. Oh, give me time. I have so much to think about. Sorry to see you leave so soon, Mr Gordon. So am I. The car is waiting, sir. Michael. - Darling. Let's go back to the plantation today. Everything will be just as it was before. Will it, Linda? I'll try, Michael. I am so grateful to you. You've been wonderful all these years. The best friend I've ever had. You know you can count on me. Gratitude, friendship. Everything but the one word I want to hear. That is reserved for Matt. You won't admit it because you're my wife and you don't want to hurt me. I wish I deserved it. But you do. No. For three years I've known all about you. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to lose you. I knew all about Matt Gordon too. What happened to me. It's not your fault. But I could have helped you, but I didn't. That young doctor that was on the plantation. He said he could have cured you. But I sent him away. Do you still think I'm your best friend? Yes. I'll try and prove it to you. Come along. We bought nothing but antiques. At least that's what they've charged us for it. We're lucky. Look at poor Mr Gordon. Why that is an absolute outrage. I'm glad they are my bags and not yours. Why, he didn't even touch ours. Where are they going with those? Gerald! If they mess up those things of mine, I'll go straight to the American Consul. They won't, Mrs Bellows. I'll take care of it. A perfect gentleman, Mr Gordon. They are in the that one, Hewitt. In a shoe bag. And .. Just to make it worth your while. Is this a confession or a declaration? That's up to you to decide. [ Tannoy: ] "Final call, Flight 5." "For Manilla, Honolulu and San Francisco." Your plane? That's still up to you. Have a good trip. You know, Hewitt. I'm sorry I'm leaving so soon. When I'm just beginning to like you. "All aboard, please." Mr Gordon? - Yes. Fasten your seatbelts, please. "Now taking off. Fight 5." "For Manilla, Honolulu and San Fran?isco." No. No reason for nervousness, lad?es and gentlemen. We've been ordered back. Please fasten your seatbelts again. T-G ??
