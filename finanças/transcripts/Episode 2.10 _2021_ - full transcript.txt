A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES THE CHARACTERS AND SITUATIONS PRESENTED HERE, AND THE NAMES USED IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS. ANY SIMILARITIES TO NAMES, CHARACTERS, STORIES OR OTHER EVENTS RESEMBLING ACTUAL PERSONS OR SITUATIONS ARE PURELY COINCIDENTAL. Like a bright star In front of your eyes Grey Shark's event was like opening Pandora's box. Many believe that Charly Flow was last night's star, but there are still some unanswered questions. For instance, his alleged involvement in the abduction of Juan Camilo Mesa's son. Mesa, a celebrated producer at Surround Vibes, is currently dating famous songwriter Yeimy Montoya. The war, as coined by the media, between Yeimy Montoya and Charly Flow is a long-standing family feud. And it apparently remains an open wound. Hey, I don't know what you're talking about, but any allegations should be taken seriously and reported to the authorities. I have a clear conscience. Don't screw with me. A clear conscience? Don't be so cynical. You're unethical, immoral, shameless! -Baby. -What's up? I'm going with you to Surround, okay? Give me a minute, I'll get ready. -Are you okay? -I have an idea. I told everyone we are having a meeting. We're leaving together. -But why? -Come on. What is it? Are you in love with me or something? Are you happy? Are you? Hey, man. Get her out of here. She's-- Why didn't you tell me anything? Oh, it doesn't matter, Mom. How can you say it doesn't matter? It's on national television. Yes, but it's the same old story. Yeimy claiming that everything that goes wrong in this city is my fault. -I don't care. -This has to stop. We have to do something, son. We have to do something. She can't keep screwing up your life. Hey. Take it easy, Mrs. Ligia. You should talk to me. What have you been up to? I'm just here, bored. Worried about you all the time. And José, he went to that farm to work, and we barely see each other. Oh, really? Did he say that? Yes, why? Forget it. It's all good. See you later. Seemingly decent people Rich bankers and even the homeless Emi, I found his dinosaur pajamas! In spite of the scandal, and Yeimy Montoya and Juan Camilo Mesa's baseless allegations, we can say that last night's undeniable winner was Charly Flow, who came back to dominate the music scene and to leave the skeptical speechless. There were more surprises at Grey Shark's event in Medellín. One of them was Cris Vega's performance. -He's an artist who... -Coming. was working with Surround Vibes, but shocked everyone -because he got bit by the shark. -I'll get it. This is bad news for Surround. -Come in. -How are you? -Fine. -I'm picking up Emi. Is he ready? Yes. Yes, he's ready. Give me a second. Emi, Mom's here! Come here. Okay. Will you be good? Yes? Will you have a good time? And then you'll tell me all about it. Oh. I will miss you so much, love. Give me a hug. Bye, honey. Come on, we have to go. -The car is outside. -Bye, honey. Okay, come on. Hold on, don't hurry. Come here. Careful, you might slip. Okay, good job. -Come here. -So cute. Oh, honey. Be good and take care, okay? I love you so much, dinosaur. Don't let go of Mom's hand. -Okay? -Everything is under control. -Danilo will watch out for him, okay? -Yes, I know. Bodyguard and all. Everything is under control. -So don't worry. Come on. -Hold on to Mom's hand. Come on, then. Here. Bye. -Hey, baby. -Bye. It's just for a couple of days. Everything will be fine. Come on. They are waiting for us. -Okay, I'll wait for you. -I'll get my purse. I'll wait for you. Now, together and united. Earlier, it was pure ecstasy because that event was like a Hollywood film. It had everything. Production, action. Excitement, suspense. Yes, but unfortunately everything revolved around Charly. Why unfortunately? Because I signed with you to be a star. Listen, Mr. Mike. My son is no one's second choice. You give him what he deserves or we-- Listen, this is Grey Shark. A multinational company. It's not a small company that works with one artist. Okay? And you have a very specific target audience, and so does Charly Flow, see? Yes. But everyone is talking about Charly now. He's on the news, the media, everywhere. And we are the only ones talking about me. Because it was a clipping service strategy with Charly. Listen, you don't have to be angry at Charly. Be angry at yourself. Because here, at Grey Shark, your best self will come out. So focus on working hard to be more polished, and to improve. My son doesn't have to work on anything. He's already a star. And his talent will be appreciated anywhere. Listen, lady. You are here right now only out of the kindness of my heart. But your opinion doesn't matter here. Out there, there is a continuous, endless line of super talented singers without overprotective mothers. And they are willing to sign without taking a look at the contract. You're right, ma'am. You can keep him. We don't want him here. -Bye. -No, Mike. Come back. Don't be like that. We were just talking. Oh, why would you say that to him? Well, whatever. -Oh, no. -What happened? I want one like this, please. Can you do that? Like this, yes. We can do that. Who is that? What? -Then what, man? -What's up, guys? -So? -So what? -Fine or what? -I'll see you later. Detective? How are you? -How are you? I was waiting for you. -Detective, how are you? We made some progress on the investigation. -Oh, great. -Yes, let's go to my office. -Guzmán, how are you? -We have established that alias Dina and alias Alergia are a couple. Who is Alergia? A hitman connected to the bomb placed at Ligia Cruz's restaurant. He was seen on surveillance cameras the day of the explosion and on previous days too. Did you tell Ligia? About the explosion being intentional? Yes, why? Because, if Charly is involved, I don't want him to find out and get rid of evidence that leads to him. Oh, why would he organize an attack on his own mother's restaurant, baby? Oh, honey, I don't know. But we're missing something. I am sure that Charly was involved in Emilio's attempted kidnapping. -Well-- -Now, what is his relationship with Charly Cruz? We can't focus on Charly Cruz. We need to uncover the truth. Okay, but we can keep investigating his people, right? Silvia Duarte, his lawyer. I don't know. No, I can't. I can't keep wasting my resources on investigating whoever you want. To do that, we need proof, a trace. What do you have against Mr. Charly Cruz's lawyer? -She knew Dina. -How do you know that? It's a hunch. A hunch. That's not enough. No, I have to keep looking for these criminals. And, honestly, I'm sorry, but I can't do anything about that. Excuse me. Okay, Detective. Can I get you some coffee? No. No, thank you. -See you. -See you. Here. Let me ask you something. Did Juancho and Yeimy ever cook for you? Anything yummy? The little princess doesn't know how to cook. She told me she had a bad time in prison. Well, I know how to cook. And what are we making? Cupcakes! -Yes. -Super cupcakes. -No. -Yes, they're yummy. Look. -Put chocolate there. Delicious. -But-- -I need to get more because-- -But we have to do this. That's right. -We have to do this. -Hey. Do you know that Juancho and Yeimy are in trouble because of Charly? Oh, yes. It's getting ugly. -I saw it on the news. -Yes. But I never thought Charly would make this happen. What do you mean? Why? Because the more problems she has, the better it is for me. And I'll get him back, Mom. I will. What about you? Let's see. How is this going? Oh, you're eating it, aren't you? Is everybody here? Is anyone in the kitchen or the toilet? No? Everyone ready? -Hey, man. Move. -Okay. Come on. So we're all here. Okay. Hi. Okay. -Well, I-- -Come on, I get nervous. Axl, hurry. Okay, then. Listen, guys. I guess you all saw what happened last night. -What happened? -Okay. Well, based on that, I made a decision, and I think it will benefit everyone here in our home, Surround. Because I think a war is coming, guys. A war in which, I hope, we all become soldiers. -Okay? -Of course. And our best weapon? Music, of course. -Our music and style. -Our style, that's right. Okay, well... Listen, guys. For a very long time... I've been avoiding something, since I was a little girl. Because I was afraid... I thought I didn't want to do it. But we need to overcome our fears to achieve our dreams. Right? You, more than anyone else, know how much I love producing stories, creating them. Turning my feelings and experiences into song lyrics and music. But, well, I've... I've been hiding behind this role of a songwriter to, well, avoid doing something else. Facing people. Oh, man. So, that's it. You guys are my family. We've built this together. Every brick is a contribution made by each of you. And you're the first ones who should know that I'm officially starting my singing career. -Great. -Yes. That's amazing! Hey, let's open a bottle of champagne! -Long live the Queen of Flow! -No champagne. Let's get back to work. Come on. Let's get back to work, honey. You, back to recording. You were recording. Oh, look who is here. Congratulations. -What's up, Juancho? -Congratulations. Vane, let's finish. Thank you. Thank you. It went well, right? Good. Well, I think everyone is on board. Oh, I can't believe it. It's really happening. Okay, then. We need to work on the announcement to the media. We have to think about-- -What's wrong, Juan? -Oh, baby. You didn't tell me about it. Why? I don't know. I was so excited, I got carried away. I didn't think it would bother you. -No. -I'm sorry. It doesn't bother me. You know I support you. But what really bothers me... is the reason behind this decision. The reason? What? That I've wanted to be a singer since I was a kid? No, that's not it. You know I've always supported you. You know I've been trying to get you to do this for a long time. But you didn't want to. And then, suddenly Charly Flow comes back, signs with Grey Shark, and boom! Yeimy, the Queen of Flow. Yes. Yes, so what? It's one of the reasons. But I don't get why it surprises you, Juan. I already told you. I won't let Charly Flow become the most successful one. No way. -Oh, baby. -He doesn't deserve it. Honey, please. You're so much better than that. Listen. Do you really think you're doing this for the right reasons? What if you are wrong? -Oh, wrong? -Yes. For making things right? For keeping Charly from being number one? What do you mean by "making things right," babe? And how can he become number one when everybody knows that's you? Huh? You need to shine bright, but for yourself, not anyone else, especially not that jerk. Or are you going to start a war with him? Huh? This is weird coming from you, Juan. Because you know what he did to us. And he keeps doing it. I'm sorry to interrupt. Guys? Can you be on my side? Is that too much to ask? Guys, Grey Shark just announced that Charly will give a press conference. Let's see. "Change of Skin" is a special song to me because back then, I was going through the worst moment of my life. And it turned into a song that ended up giving me hope, you know? It kept me going, you know? -What inspired it? -Love. As the song goes, love transforms. Unfortunately, sometimes, into hatred. But in the end, it goes back to its original form, love. 100% pure love. Is it based on your personal experience? Princess, when you pour your heart and soul into a song, obviously, there is a part of you in that song. That is true, really true. Is there a special woman who inspired "Change of Skin"? There are some rumors. Oh, really? What do they say? Come on, tell me. Well, based on the history between you and Yeimy Montoya, -people think it's about her. -What history? Princess, that's very imaginative. And that's my job. People can interpret the song as they please. I want them to like the song. To enjoy it, dance to it. That's what matters to me. But those lyrics are too real, you talk about asking the one you hurt to forgive you. And we all know that, well... Princess, well. No. As I said, I work with emotions. My thing is to move people. That's my thing, moving people. You also talked about someone you lost, a love you may get back. Hey, that's mere gossip. Too much gossip and too little music. Another question, please. Are you sure no one will come out and say this song is about them? It's happened before. Princess, I understand your curiosity. But the question... In this specific case, there is not even a remote chance. I poured my heart and soul into that song, with my own handwriting. So... No, no. Okay, um... From now on, only Charly Flow's work alone shows that, despite incessant false accusations, his talent remains strong. Are you referring to what Yeimy Montoya said -about Charly? -Yes, miss. Of course. -At the event? -About her-- Yes, miss. I'm talking about her and those who believed that Charly Flow's career was over. It is not over. You know what? They will be left speechless. And I really appreciate this interview. Good afternoon. -Thank you. -No. Thank you, princess. Listen. We will have to... in your case... I don't know if you heard, but you will have to react strongly whenever they bring up Yeimy Montoya. -Hey. -No. We need to fight back all the time because of what she said. I will not add fuel to the fire with Yeimy. I don't care. It's over. Oh, what? What... What... Zaf, I can't see Charly, can you? No, I can't. Hey, what do you mean, man? I'm right here. She attacked me that day, I stood up for myself. It's over. -A war? Don't screw with me. -No. She started a war by saying that you don't write your own songs and that you are talentless. And I won't play along, I will not respond to her accusations. That's what she wants. But she wants to crush you with those accusations. She says it all the time, you became famous with her songs. See? That you are talentless. And now, she says you tried to kidnap her son. -Hey, listen to me. -Don't you think that's serious? I didn't get out of prison to do this all over again. This vicious circle where Yeimy attacks me and I strike back. No, to hell with that. I want to become number one. -Of course. -To be on the top. -To do concerts. -Sure. And you said we would make it happen, didn't you? Exactly, but you need to know that you will do what I say -to achieve that. -Let's calm down. -How? -She will not stop. -Can't you see? -Can we calm down? -You can't let her do that. -Calm down! -Thank you. -I'm sick of this. -Charly, listen. -What? Your song is doing great. That's all that matters right now. And Charly should be rehearsing. -Oh, of course. -A new album is coming -and a lot of shows, too. -That's right. -That's right. -That's right. -I should do that. -Okay. That's right. Get to work. I have so many questions about him. Among them... Is he an idiot? What's wrong with him? He says prison changed him, and that's what's going on. -But relax, breathe. -I don't give a damn about his time in prison. That drama with Yeimy Montoya is working to keep him relevant. And we will exploit it. Whether he likes it or not. It has nothing to do with that. -That's true. -Understood? -Okay. -Absolutely. -What do you think? -Huh? I don't know, doll. That's not me. Oh, Yeimicita. But you would look amazing. Thank you, honey. Especially for believing that I am 16. Let's keep working on it to get a look that reflects who I am. -Okay? -Okay. Got it. We need to fight for our way. Listen to her. Are we going to war or something? Well, yes. Right? Because this has a lot to do with Charly, doesn't it? Oh, honey. Don't think about that. But that is how I can get inspiration for an amazing look so you can take his place at the top. Because you are the only one who can do it. Well, the other thing I want to do is... well, announce my singing career on Mero Power. Why? Because Mero Power is the biggest urban station. It is a radio station from the commune. And, I don't know, I feel it's connected to everything. Can you help me with that? Of course, honey. And have you thought about the song you will choose to leave him speechless? -Already have it. -Really? Can you play it for us, then? Okay, then. Go. Oh, these are so good. You can't have them. -Come on. -There's few of them, but they are yummy. -Marinito. -Hi. Folder one. -Yes. -Track one. Okay. "Phoenix," do you remember? Nice. Okay. Come on. Every wound I carry from the past Is a new weapon that I'm preparing I'm the candle that burns Bird of fire, born out of pain I'm new and filled with strength I come from nothing to touch the stars -And I fly... -Oh, so cool. And I fly, and today I'm made stronger And I fly... And today I'm made stronger By what killed me yesterday And I fly, bathed in fire Flying through the skies like a star Today the mermaid of fire was reborn Strong warrior woman I come renewed to keep a promise I pity the guy Who doesn't remember me anymore I come seeking the opportunity To get justice and make him pay I come softly So he doesn't hear my steps Below the water So they don't see what I'm carrying My flame is eternal No one will extinguish it Only my justice will calm my fury And I fly... Like a phoenix That emerged from the fire And I fly... And today I'm made stronger By what killed me yesterday And I fly, bathed in fire Flying through the skies like a star Today the mermaid of fire was reborn Strong warrior woman I feel in my body a complete woman I feel in my veins The blood that burns I feel again that I have the strength Nobody knows that I've returned I feel in my body a complete woman I feel in my veins The blood that burns I feel again that I have the strength Nobody knows that I've returned Nobody knows That I'm coming to the war And I fly... Like a phoenix That emerged from the fire And I fly... And today I'm made stronger By what killed me yesterday And I fly, bathed in fire Flying through the skies like a star Today the mermaid of fire was reborn Strong warrior woman Let's get back to work. What is it, baby? I loved it. I thought we were talking about another song. No, we were talking about this one, "Phoenix." I finished it long ago, I performed it in Puerto Rico. And then nothing. Well, I really loved the song, Juancho. Yes, I really liked it, too. The song is amazing. You sound absolutely amazing, honey. But there's another song that would be a better first single. It's this one, Juan. Okay? It's about empowerment. It's about me. Well, I love that, empowerment. And you are also telling Charly that you will win. And what's more important? Releasing a powerful song in every sense or sending a message to that jerk? Listen, Juan. I'll go with this one. -This is the one. -Wait, I'm lost. Which one is the other song? We're talking about this one, Pite. Okay, then. Give us five minutes, please. Thanks. Things are heating up between Juancho and Yeimy. And not in a good way. No. Well, it's normal. This is what Charly does. He comes between people. Right? Like you and your brother. Yes or no? I don't get why you're not considering the song you've been working on to be your first single. What is it called? It doesn't have a title. Look how confident I am. Well, if you're not confident and you think it's bad, then why did you spend so much time and put so much effort into it? Because that's how the creative process works. How many songs end up sounding bad the next day? It happens. It happened with this song. Wait. Honey. If I'm doing this, I need you by my side, supporting me, like always. Well... I'm here. Let's do this. Together. -Like we always do. -Yes. Yes, honey. Okay? But I'm begging you. Let's put Charly aside. -Please, I'm begging you. -Okay. Trust me. "Phoenix" is the one. I know what I'm doing, okay? We'll see what we do with the other song, okay? Okay, it was weird. But I have to agree just for one reason. What? Because the entire world needs to hear the Queen of Flow. That's it. Oh, don't pout. Why are you pouting? How are we doing, people? I have an amazing surprise for you. Urban music was born here, in Medellín. And a star is shining in Mero Power, none other than urban music royalty, Yeimy Montoya is in the house, people! What's up, Yeimy? How are you? What's up, man? It's such a pleasure to be here, everyone. You know how much love I have for you and the station, what it means to me. Well, I have some news. I have news. You all know me as a songwriter, a producer. But we all have dreams, right? -What? -Yes, do you know what I want? -Wait, wait. -I want it to sound like a high-mix. Stop what you are doing. You have to see this, now. Our dreams since we were kids. And my dream was to be a singer. And I think it's my time, so, everybody, I'm starting my singing career. -Boom! -Wow! Did you hear, people? Yeimy Montoya, a singer. And you heard it first on Mero Power Stereo. Yeimy, I have a question for you. What is driving you to take the stage? Well, Búho, it's time. Time. You know, you all know my story. I was isolated from the world for many years. And for something I didn't do. So my career was stuck for many years, but that dream remains, you know? I have a lot to say with my songs, and I can feel the stage right there, waiting for me. You becoming a singer is the best -that could happen to urban music. -Yes, sir. Oh, thank you. Amen to that! Amen. Yes. My songs have been performed by others for a very long time. It is time to pursue my dream and to show, through my art, that my music and what I have to say come from here, my heart. Because we all came from the same place, putting in a lot of effort and sharing the same pride, Búho. -That's right. -Not like some who run their mouths about the hood but can't wait to leave it behind them. You know who I'm talking about. Yes, ma'am. This is Yeimy Montoya. -Listen to her. -But I came -to talk about music. -This crap-- -I have a surprise for you. -Okay. An exclusive, because of how much love I have for you. Oh, no. Our expectations are going through the roof. Come on. Well, I wrote this song, an exclusive for Mero Power, "Phoenix," some years ago, but I won't say what it's about. Listen and you'll understand. Every wound I carry from the past Is a new weapon that I'm preparing I'm the candle that burns Bird of fire, born out of pain I'm new and filled with strength I come from nothing to touch the stars -Hey, man. Did you say this wasn't a war? Then, what is this? Because the song is good. No. No. I mean, this song is amazing. And I fly, bathed in fire Flying through the skies like a star Today the mermaid of fire was reborn That's what I wanted. Thanks, Yeimy. -Here, sweetheart. Yes, ma'am. -We did it. Good. Can you tell me what the hell is going on with you and that woman? I'm not interested in her, man. Leave that alone already. Well, she definitely thinks this is not over yet. Look. You know? I hired a charismatic Charly Flow. Who is strong. The Charly Flow who knows how this works. Are you that Charly? Or are you a dumbass who turns the other cheek and keeps getting beaten up? Tell me. Because, if that's the case, you're not useful to me, man. No, you're not useful to me. Listen. Make up your mind. And we'll see if we keep going. I'll try to persuade Manín not to launder money through Charly's foundation. Because I don't want to get him involved. Okay, but there will be legal implications against Charly. Okay, I'll follow your orders. Who was that? Why? Because you know the boss doesn't want cell phones around here. It looks new. I haven't seen it before. You know what, Caronte? The rule about cell phones around here applies to workers, not to me. Sir. I need to move some money around. And I need to do it through Charly's foundation. Well, that's in the works. How long does it take? It depends on how long the-- Lately, you seem slower. I need you to be committed. Do whatever it takes. Let my nephew know I'm the one in charge. Okay, sir. A drink? Not today, thanks. -How are you? How did it go? -What's up, Mom? How are you? Fine. Did you hear Yeimy's announcement? What do you think? What do I think? I think that song is absolutely amazing. What a goddamn hit. And she sounds unbelievably good, right? Did you hear it? And where is this admiration coming from? What? I admire her. But you know what, Mom? I feel something else for her. -What? -I don't know. -I don't know. -What? I don't know, Mom. When she made the announcement, for instance, I went back in time. When I was a kid, when I walked around the hood singing, dancing. When I met her. When I realized she was much more talented than I was, for instance. More talented than you? You've always been talented, son. Yes, I know. But she is, too. That girl is talented. Well, the music industry is huge. I think you can coexist and end this. Yes, I wish she would think that way. All she wants to do is screw up my life, and the worst part is, she thinks we're on the same page. No, you do your thing. Do your thing. You signed with a good company. Let her drown in her own poison. Let's hope so, Mom. Nobody can benefit from a war. But what war are you talking about? What war? -It's good. -No. If she wants to fight, let her fight alone. I don't see anyone trying to fight Yeimy Montoya, right? Right? It's all good. It's fine, Mom. Pite, I believe this color palette is the one. -Which one? Do you think so? -Sure. -But this one is cooler, look-- -What's up, guys? Hey, how are you? Oh, fine. Have you seen Juancho? I have a session with him. No. He's busy with the queen's first single. Yes. But once we're done with this, I'm sure he will pick up where you left off. -Cool. See you, okay? -Okay. -Say hi to Eric for me. -Sure. Okay. Are you sure you don't want coffee? Yes, Dad. Water is fine. Thank you. What's up with my talented daughter? Not much, Dad. I'm a bit worried, you know? Why is that? What happened? My music career, Dad. But I see how successful you are and how much everybody loves you. Well, yes. But in Surround, not that much anymore. They treat me like dirt. Since Yeimy announced her music career, I don't know, I feel like I've been set aside. And everybody thinks that I'm like Eric's shadow. No, honey. We are not what people think of us. We are who we are. That's true. Look at you, huh? Leaving everyone speechless. Nobody thought you would change. And now look at you. There you go, honey. Here I am. I am so proud of you. Dad, thank you for hearing me out. -I love you so much. -I love you, too. -Be good. -Okay. -See you. -And cheer up, okay? Hold your head up high. UNTITLED I can't sleep I dream of you You own me When you kiss me I'm crazy for you You've become my crazy fixation I dreamt of you You stole my attention I close my eyes I'll die over this obsession I can't get you out of my mind I don't know what to do now I don't want to picture You touching me like that I'm just waiting for the sun to rise Because you're my obsession... FROM MANÍN: TOMORROW THEY'LL PICK YOU UP AT 8 AM. I NEED TO TALK TO YOU FACE TO FACE. ...Will be my downfall Because you're my obsession You're my fixation To feel your body on mine Will be my downfall The unconscious betrays me so much I think of you all the time I know I'm crazy, hon But I want you to be mine It's like I'm afraid you're gonna run But I'm no saint myself, sweetheart Talk to me like that, softly Talk in my ear, slowly In my dreams I visit you Say you wanna see me too I can't get you out of my mind... -Does it hurt a lot? -It hurts a lot. A lot. ...I don't know what to do now Because you're my obsession You're my fixation To feel your body on mine Will be my downfall Because you're my obsession You're my fixation To feel your body on mine Will be my downfall FIXATION Hey, Mom. This is good, thank you. No, you're going to work. You should eat well. -Finish that. -It's okay. No, it's yummy. Eat some. Oh, here he is. It wasn't that long, ma'am. -Well, then. I'll get going. -Okay, honey. -I love you. -No, Charly. Don't go. Don't go. I want to tell you something. I know you don't like me, right? You think I'm insignificant, right? What? I do. I think José is a worthless alcoholic. -Shut up. -A recovering alcoholic, Charly. Listen to him. There is no such thing, man. And I'm sorry, Mom. But he is not good enough for you. No. Wait a minute. He's such a brave man. And you don't know how much he struggles every day to stay sober. He is the only man who respects me. He gives me what I deserve. Not even your father was like that. Manín is even worse. -Don't talk about my dad. -Oh, really? I won't lie. And, even if it hurts, your dear and loving father was a sexist who kept me locked up at home. Oh, what's-- This is not the problem. Exactly. You are the problem. Get out, I don't want to see you here. Who do you think you are to meddle in my relationship and my life? No, sir. I am your son. And I thought this was between men. But you seem to be a coward, huh? I can say to your face that I will change your mind about how you think of me. Listen to him. I know losers like you. You'll fail on your own. Oh, no. I am so sorry, José. Don't worry, Ligia. Nothing can keep us apart. Don't worry. Oh, God. This is Charly, who he has always been. I thought he could change. Man. Listen to me, this is the last time you pick me up here. I don't want to be seen with you, let alone Uncle Manín. Man, chill. I just do what the boss says. Besides, you don't know where we are going. And where is that? Oh, hop in already. I'll treat you like a princess, man. There is something. Something that doesn't let me sleep at night. Why am I doing this? Because I want to do it? Or to screw with Charly? Well, I don't know the answer. You do. Right? You are an artist, honey. That's what makes you different. But people, sometimes, are scared of someone different. And they do dumb stuff like that girl at your school. No, Dad. I am just an ordinary person. No, honey. You will eventually realize that you're not. And you can't let people who don't understand you ruin your dreams. And I didn't raise you to cry all day in your bedroom. Did I? No. No, I am doing this for me. Do you still want it? Yes. Yes, for my parents and my grandma. I wish they were still here. Okay, then. It is your time. Let's show the world that you are much more than a woman who has wanted revenge for 17 years. Moreover, let's say that you were thinking about what to do for 17 years. -The queen. -The Queen of Flow. Deal with it. Yeimy, honestly, if you do on stage what I've seen you do in this office, you'll knock it out of the park. Okay, then. Now listen to me. You will let everything out. Everything inside your heart and your mind. Everything in your unconscious. And everything means everything. Subtitle translation by: Karen Vera
