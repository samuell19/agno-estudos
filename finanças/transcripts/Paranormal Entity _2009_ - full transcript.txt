[Thomas crying] [chattering] [Man] This is my wonderful family. My wonderful mom Ellen. Mom, say hi to the camera. Hi. Smile. Look at her. And my beautiful sister Samantha. Samantha, smile at the camera. Smile. Look at her. Isn't she pretty? You being sarcastic? Gor... Hey, did you guys, uh... Did you guys coordinate... color coordinate tonight? I must've missed the memo. Yes, we did, as a matter of fact. You did miss the memo. We left you out 'cause we hate you. Mom, he's being weird. Is this to get out of helping us with cleaning up, Thomas? Uh, no. Put the camera down and help us clean up. Of course not. Mom, thank you for dinner. You're very welcome. It was a wonderful dinner. Um, Thomas, I just... I wanna ask you... I understand... I know Dr. Marr wants us to do this whole thing. But how come we have cameras just in our rooms and not in your room? Because you guys don't wanna see what's going on in my room. Does anybody care to say anything, um, about our little experiment here? About how you're gonna capitalize on the fact that... I'm not capitalizing on anything. Mr. Psychic Dude told us to document everything, so what better way to do that than with a video camera? I think he meant, like, write it down. I don't write good. We are rolling. Testing, testing, one, two, three. Coming into focus. And there we are. Thomas Finley. This is my bedroom. This is where I sleep. Today is the maid's day off. So we go down the hallway here, into the living room. We have a camera in the corner. Again, it'll be on night vision, filming. Eight-hour battery pack to film all night long so we can capture whatever happens in this room. This is Samantha's room. We have a camera on the tripod recording and night vision. It has an eight-hour battery pack to film whatever is or is not happening. And then, if we cross the hall... Sorry. Thomas! [door slams] Shit. Um, and then in Mom's room, we have a camera in the corner. Mom? Mom? Is that Dad's? [phone ringing] [ringing continues] [Man on answering machine] Hi. You've reached the Finleys. We can't take your call right now, but if you leave a message, we'll get back to you. Thank you. [Beeps] [static] [line disconnects, beeps] Good morning. Somebody looks wonderful this morning. Nice. What are we making here for breakfast? I'm having oatmeal. What are you making me? I'm not making you anything. I'm making myself oatmeal. Looks like vomit. Yeah, well, make yourself something. I see somebody's in a good mood this morning. Uh-huh. Especially when you call my food vomit. That makes me really happy. Makes me great. Dude, don't you have, like, a job or something you can go to? Today I'm officially unemployed. Oh, that's shocking. Really shocking. See, this is my surprised face. Oh, that's good.Yeah. You getting this? This is how surprised I am you're unemployed. I think you're gonna get an award for this. Yeah. You're a loser. So, um, any visits from Dad last night? That's not funny. Leave your sister alone, Tommy, okay? Just stop. What about you, Mom? Anything happen last night? You want some coffee, Sam? Huh? No. Mom? Yes, Tommy? Did something happen? I don't wanna talk about it. I think we should talk about it. I think it's important to discuss what's going on in this house. Turn the camera off. And why it's happening. Turn the camera off. I think the fact that you thought you were talking to Dad is... Turn the goddamn camera off! About a year ago, my husband David was tragically killed in a car accident. And I miss him a lot. A day doesn't go by that I don't think about him, you know? So, a couple of months ago, I just... I just started talking to him, you know? I just... just started to talk, pretending that he could talk back to me, you know? And then, one day...[stammering] We were at this really kind of weird, wacky store. There was just, uh, this lady there, and she was saying to us that you can actually... you can talk to the dead by writing to them. And so, I was, like, "All right." So I went home and I... I just... I pulled out a pen and a pad of paper, and I just started writing one night. I just wrote and just... I wrote, and... I just felt like something was with me. You know, something was taking over me. And I just... I... I just... I felt like I was really talking to David. Like he was really talking back to me, you know? I mean, with every... with every... stroke of the pen, it was like he was there with me. And so, every night, I would go into my bedroom and I would write to him, and he would write back to me. I really thought that I was talking to David. But then, these just... Then, just kind of, like... Then weird things started happening, and... I don't know. Just, like, really, um... I don't know. Bad stuff. Bad stuff happening... happening to Samantha. [sighs] Really bad stuff. And I just... [stammering] No, that is not David, okay? David would... would not... Would not do this stuff. Who do you think it is? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what the hell this thing is. But whatever it is, it is not your father. [glass shatters] What was that? [mutters] It's all over the floor. Oh, shit! Came right out of there. Jesus Christ. And camera is... [beeps] on. You okay? Mm-hmm. I'm next door. [rumbling] [static] [rumbling stops] [rumbling] [rumbling stops] [Samantha] Thomas! What? I found it on the floor. [sighs] Give it to me. All I'm saying to Sam is that it's possible the cross fell off the wall. And into the corner? Things don't fall off walls and hit the ground and move into the corner? No, they don't, like, fly diagonally. They don't... Who says it flew diagonally? Square things don't roll. I didn't say it rolled, but who said it flew diagonally off the wall? It was several feet away. So? You could've kicked it. What if she didn't? If it fell on my feet? What if she didn't kick it? All I'm saying is just 'cause the cross fell off a wall, that doesn't mean the ghost did it. That's all I'm saying. I don't like the fact that you're implying that your sister is lying. I'm not implying she's lying. You are. I didn't say she was lying at all. Well, these things could be happening. The cross falling off the wall doesn't mean the ghost knocked it off. No, you're right. Every time something falls off a wall doesn't mean that a ghost did it. You're right. It doesn't. I am right, Sam. Yeah, you're totally right. It doesn't. I'm not saying there's nothing going on here, Mom. I'm just saying that the cross doesn't mean that. All he's saying is that it makes a good scene for his fucking movie that's gonna make him famous. Shut the fuck up. Seriously, I'm getting a little tired... All right, you guys. I don't give a shit what you're tired of. Stop all this swearing, okay? Then shut the fuck up... Stop. I want you to stop this. [phone ringing] Stop it. [ringing continues] Christ. Hello? Did he leave that fucking camera on? Um, yeah. He actually doesn't live here anymore. No. No, that's okay. Bye. [Ellen sighs] Nice. Nice, dude. You're a fucking jackass. Mom? Mom! [phone ringing] Hello. Hello? Hello! [hangs up phone] Sam? Hey. Hi. Sorry I yelled. Why are you shooting me right now while I'm getting ready for bed? 'Cause I'm apologizing. I thought I'd get it on the record. I don't want you to think l don't believe you. You don't believe me. I do believe you. Everything's just a little crazy, you know? So I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. We cool? Yeah. It's cool. Cool. I'll see you tomorrow. [buzzing] [buzzing] David? David? Thomas! [footsteps thudding] Tom! What? Did you do this? Do what? That writing on the table. What the fuck? No. That's not funny, dude. Sam, I didn't do it. Mom! What the fuck does it mean? Mom! Yeah? U-C... Come here.[footsteps] You see? Mom, did you do this? That doesn't make any sense. No. No. I didn't write that. Well, somebody did it. What does it mean? You don't remember doing it? No. I don't remember any of this. Well, you did it. I don't remember getting out of bed. Well, 3:30 a.m. You think you're sleepwalking? I mean, I never heard of anybody sleepwalking... I don't know. And then starts writing on a table. I don't know, Thomas. I have no idea. And you don't know what you wrote? You don't know what it means? I don't remember getting up. So you have no idea what the letters on the table mean? No. And you took the paper somewhere. You got a paper in your hand. Oh, God. And that's it. [sighs] It's pretty freaky, Mom. Thomas, what is wrong with me? There is something wrong with me. I don't remember any of this. What the hell is going on? I don't kn... I'm losing my fucking mind. Mom, I think there's something going on in this house. I don't know that there's anything wrong with you. There's something in this house. And where is this doctor? Where's the... Dr. Loren. I've called him so many times, and he's still on vacation. And he keeps saying when he gets back he's gonna come over as soon as he can. Well, does he know what's going on here? Does he know what's going on with Samantha? I've told him. I've... 'Cause, Mom... I know, I know. I think she's freaked out. And I think more and more that this all has something to do with her. I know. For some... I... I know. I think you're right. Well, let's... Tomorrow... I think it has something to do with her. Then let's call this Dr. Loren again tomorrow and tell him he needs to get over here ASAP. I'll call him tomorrow morning again. All right. Or we'll get somebody else. Here you go. [sighs] Oh, God. You okay? No. I don't know what's happening. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. I don't know why this is happening. [sighs] Okay. So, um... a while ago, I started feeling like... something was in the room with me when I was asleep. When I was trying to sleep. And then... like, a week ago, um... I woke up to something. I don't know what it... I don't know what woke me up. But, um, I couldn't... get out of the bed. I just was laying there, like, and I couldn't sit up, and I couldn't turn my head to figure out what woke me up. I... I just... [sighs] And then it was like something just came and... pressed on my chest really hard. Like it was just, like, holding me down. Like it didn't want me to move. It was just really weird, and it took, like, everything that I... could... All the energy that I could get to sit up and look around the room and to fight it... it was like somebody was pushing me down. Just, like, with one hand. But it... There was... I mean, I got up and I turned the light on and there was... I mean, there was nothing... there. I don't know. I thought... I mean, at the time, I thought l was just crazy. And then all this other stuff starts happening, and... I just don't get why it's happening to me. So that was the first time it happened? Yeah. Do you think it's gonna happen again? I don't know. I don't know. It's like every time I go to sleep, I'm just laying there... wanting to sleep, but if I fall asleep, then I'm afraid l'm gonna wake up and it's gonna happen, and if I stay up all night and it doesn't, then I just didn't sleep at all, and... I don't know. There's... there's no way to win. There's no way to win. [door creaks open] [floorboards creak] [creaking continues] [breathing] [clatter] [Sam screams] [screaming] Stop it! Stop it! [banging] Help! [Thomas] I can't open the door! Thomas, help! Open the door! No! No! It's okay. I'm here. It's okay, it's okay. [crying] I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. I'm okay. You okay? Uh, yes, hi, Dr. Loren. This is Ellen Finley and, um, again. I'm calling you again, and you must... You're probably still on vacation, but I really need to speak with you. So can you call me as soon as you get this message? I... It's very important that I talk to you. Okay? So... I think you've got all my numbers. If you don't, it's 323-791-9157. Thank you, Dr. Fin... Loren. I gotta talk with you. Okay. [knocking] Honey? Yeah. I'm taking your sister out. Do you need anything? No, I'm okay. [door closes] [knocking] What? [Sam] Thomas! Yeah? What? What is it? Sam? Sam? [Sam] Thomas! "Maron." [phone rings] [phone rings] Hi. You've reached the Finleys. We can't take your call right now, but if you'll leave a message, we'll get back to you. Thank you. [Beep] [whispering, indistinct] [banging] [screams] [banging, screaming] [thudding] What is that? It sounds like somebody's... [door creaks] I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. I don't know what it is. Come here, come here, come here. It's okay. What is... I don't know. Listen, listen. Shh. [banging] [all scream] [Thomas]Come on, come on, come on. Stay behind me. [banging] Here we are, here we are. [screaming] Oh my God, fuck! Listen. There's something in the room with us. [Sam] Oh my God. I can feel it. I can feel it fucking standing next to me. Stop. Listen, listen. [feedback] [screaming] Fuck. What the fuck? Shh. Listen, listen. You guys, what is that? You guys hearing this? What the hell is that? Look at that. Hold on, hold on, hold on. What the... Oh my God. Look at that, you guys. It's a footprint. Fucking footprints. I want to see where they go. No. Come on. Thomas, no. Thomas, don't. It's okay. Don't. Just stay here. I want to see where they go. Mom, make him stay. No, stop. Don't go. Let me go, let me go. Come on, I just want to see where they go. Shh. Just stay with me, it's okay. Come on, it's all right. Take my hand. Come here, I have your hand. Come on. All over the place. All over the place. Go on. What's going on? What the fuck? Why is he... What the fuck? [all scream] Fuck! [phone ringing] [crying] Are you okay? It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Come here, come here.[crying] Sam, come here. It's okay. Come here. It's okay. It's all right. Come here. It's ash. Oh, Christ. Where did you come from? Oh, shit. Oh, no. Fuck. [footsteps going up stairs] [door creaks, closes] [door closes, footsteps] [beeps] [static] [whispering, indistinct] [static, beep] What the fuck? [beep, static] [whispering, indistinct] [static, beep] [Sam] Who was that? Nobody. [beeps] [whoosh] Mom? Yeah? Here you guys are. You guys all right? Sam, you okay? All right, look. I think it's time to think about getting out of here. And where are we gonna go? I don't know, go to a motel for a couple nights? This is our house. I know, Mom, but I don't think it... Where are we gonna go? It's starting... This thing is gonna just push us out of our house? Mom, I'm... I don't know, but I think... I just... I can't... I mean, damn it. Mom, I know, but... Why hasn't Dr. Loren called us back yet? I don't know. I don't know where he is. But until he calls, until we figure this out, I think you guys should probably go to a motel for a few nights. And then what? Is this gonna just... This all gonna just poof, go away if we go away? No, I'm not saying that, Mom, but until Dr. Loren comes, you guys go. I'll stay here, I'll take care of... I'll see what happens. You're gonna see what happens? Well, I'm gonna record what happens. I'm gonna keep filming and see if I can... You know, if anything happens once you guys are gone. Okay, and you're gonna be alone here with this thing. I want you to be very careful, Thomas. Do you know what you're getting yourself into? I know, Mom, but it doesn't... Whatever this thing is doesn't seem to be interested in me. Oh. And it seems more and more to be interested in her, which is even more the reason to get the hell out of here. I know. I'm gonna take her. We're gonna go. Sam? Sam? I mean, Sam, don't you want to get out of here? Okay? All right. Okay. Well, pack some stuff. I'll take your sister and we're gonna go right now. But I want you to promise us that if something really bad happens, if this thing starts to... Mom, believe me, I promise. Trust me. I don't want you to just sit here and film it. I want you to leave. I will. I will. All right? Come on. Pack some stuff. Let's go. And I want you to call us if anything happens. Are you gonna be okay? Are you sure? I'll be fine. Just go. Call me when you get there. Okay, we will. Come here. I love you. I love you too. Call when you guys get there. Careful, honey. Please. You too. [jangles] [jingles] Camera's on. [jingles] All right, you fucker. Show yourself. [bell jingles] [footsteps] [rumbling] Jesus. [jangling] Holy shit. [jangling continues] Christ. [panting] [knocking] Jesus! Holy shit! [phone rings] Oh, shit. [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] [rings] Hello? Mom? Mom. Whoa, Mom, calm down. What... What do you mean, it followed you? Wait, Mom, listen to me. Just come home, all right? Just come here as fast as you can. Just come home. [knocking] [knocking] Jesus. What the hell happened? What happened? Christ. Are you guys okay? What happened, you guys? It followed us to the motel. Come on, get inside. What do you mean, it followed you? Sam? [door closes] It followed us to the motel, Thomas. How could it follow you? I don't know. I don't know how it could. But it was in the room with us and it attacked your sister. What do you mean it was in the room with you? It was in the bed with us, Thomas. How did it attack... You guys, somebody talk to me. You're freaking me out. What do you mean it attacked her? Mom? You guys, what happened? I don't know what happened, Thomas. We were just... We were sleeping and... I thought everything was just... Everything felt okay. And then, suddenly l felt like... something was breathing into my ear. And I woke up, and I looked over at your sister, and she was still asleep. But then I looked down, and it looked like something was... Was-was-was holding... Was pressing into her arms. And then... it just dragged her off the bed. This thing just dragged her right off the bed. And... she screamed, and-and-and I... I couldn't do anything. I... There was nothing l could do. This is... We have to make this thing go away, all right? We have got to stop this. I couldn't do anything. It's gonna be okay. There's nothing I could do. [crying] I'm sorry, honey. So sorry. [knocking] You gonna be all right in here alone? You all right? Let me know if you need anything. Okay. [rumbling] [creaking] [Sam] Thomas! Sam? [banging] [door closes] Sam? Sam! Samantha. Whew. [door closes] What the... Sam? Sam? [gasps] Sam. Samantha. Sam. Sam. Samantha. Jesus Christ, Samantha. Samantha! Sam. Can you hear me? What? I like it up here. What do you me... Come on, Sam. It's freezing up here. We're going downstairs. Watch your step. Come on, it's okay, we're gonna go downstairs. Take it... Watch your step. Come on, Sam, it's freezing. We're going downstairs. You okay? Sam? Sam? You okay? Can you hear me? It's gonna be okay. Yeah, hi. I'm calling for a Mrs. McKenzie. Mrs. McKenzie, hi. This is Thomas Finley. My parents bought the house from you a few years back. Right. Um, listen. I'm sorry to take your time, but I was wondering if you could help me. Do you know by any chance if anybody, um, anybody ever died in this house by the name of Maron? Or Maronne? Nobody? M... Spelled M-A-R-O-N. Nobody by that name? Um, no, never mind. Thank you. Sorry to take your time. Bye. [exhales] [Sam screams] Sam? [screaming continues] Sam! [screaming continues] Sam! Jesus, Sam! Come here, come here, come here. Get away! Come here! Sam, it's okay. [screaming continues] Sam, it's me. Jesus Christ! [crying] It's all right, Sam. What the fuck? Come here. It's okay, it's me. It's okay. Come on, come on. [crying] Sam, I got you. I got you. It's okay. It's okay, I got you. It's okay. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Well, she's in bed right now. Yes. No, I'm positive, no. This is... This has never happened before. No. I have no idea. He just found her. He found her like that. Yeah. Well, I mean, is there anything that I can do? I mean, should I... Can you give me... Is... Can you write a med... I mean, can you find out what's going on? Can you just write me a medication when I see you tomorrow? [sighs] All right. Okay. All right, just... I'll just wait, then. Okay. Thank you. [sighs] Sam? Oh, Jesus Christ. [crying] Mom? [crying] Oh, Jesus. Jesus, Mom. [crying] Mom, come here. Jesus Christ. What the fuck? Mom, come on. Come on, Mom, get up. Come on. [crying] Mom, get up. Come on, we got to get up. Let's go, come on. It's my fault. Nothing's your fault, Mom. Come here, come here, it's okay. I've killed her. No, you didn't kill anybody. It's gonna kill her. Mom, nothing is gonna kill her, Mom. [crying] [banging] [clinking] [clank] Jesus Christ! What did you do, Mom? Oh my God, what did you do to yourself? Samantha! Oh, shit. Mom, what did you do? Oh my God, you... Jesus, Mom! Samantha, get... Help me, somebody, help me! Oh, Mom, what did you do? [crying] Oh my God! [crying] Uh, Mom... um... if you see this, uh... they said you're gonna be okay. They just need to, um, keep an eye on you for a few days. But... I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. I, uh... I should've listened to you. And... I should've been there for you. And for Samantha. And I wasn't. So I just wanted to say I'm sorry, Mom. And, uh... I want us to be a family again. [knocking] [buzzing] It's him. Dr. Loren, hi. Thomas. Come on in. This is my sister Samantha. Hello, Samantha, nice to meet you. Pleased to meet you. Thank you for coming. Oh, if I could've been here sooner, I would've. Um, I want to say how sorry I am to hear about your mother. How is she doing? She's, uh, she's okay. They're keeping an eye on her, but she's going to be all right. Well, if I could've, I would've been here sooner. Can you make it stop? Um, I'm gonna try. Samantha, I understand that all the occurrences are happening in your room? Yeah. Take me there. This way. Okay. First, I want to say l think you were both right for not leaving. Because it would have followed you. And probably would have made it more, uh, infuriated. So I think you were both right in calling me. We just want it to stop. I understand that, Sam. I do. But I want to assure you that there is an incredible presence in this house. And it's a very negative presence. Mm-hmm. And it's very attracted to you, Sam. Now, as I understand it, your mother was trying to make contact or she believed she had made contact with your father. Is that true? Yeah. Okay. Now, what made her think that she had made contact? I don't know. She was... She... writing to him. She would write to him and then... Okay...she thought that he was writing back. She thought he was writing back to her. Okay, well, that's all very common, because when someone loses a loved one, and they're trying to make contact with that loved one, they sometimes unknowingly invite in a dark entity. Mm-hmm. It's-it's like an open door, let's say. Right. Um, a free pass. And more often than not, what happens is that entity personifies and takes over the presence of that loved one. Mm-hmm. Okay? In order to come into our world. For whatever purpose. Okay? And in this case, I believe. Sam's the purpose. Okay? So, before we start, I just want to know... I want both of you to think. Is there anything you might have forgotten? Anything at all that you could tell me? Well, I actually wanted to show you this. [paper rustles] We don't know what it means. [clears throat] Okay. Maron. It's Germanic for nightmare. Okay? In Germanic folklore, a nightmare is an evil spirit that attacks women as they sleep. Very, very similar to the Christian incubi that rapes women. Okay? Now, before we get started, I just want to make sure that both of your minds are extremely, extremely clear. And that I have 100 percent of your attention. And your concentration. Yeah. I mean... [clears throat] Sam? Okay. [Sam screams] [Thomas] Samantha! [footsteps pound] Samantha! Oh my fucking God! Samantha! [panting] Samantha! Samantha! Samantha! [Sam screams] Samantha! [screaming continues] Oh my God! Oh my God! [screaming continues] Samantha! [screaming] Samantha! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! [screaming] [chocking] [thud] [thud] [thud]
