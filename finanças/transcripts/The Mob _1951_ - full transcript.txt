Well, what do you think? These look like they were mined with a toothpick. You said you wanted something for around $150, Johnny. Yeah, but these look like samples. Would you like something for around two-fifty? I'll tell ya, I'd like something for around five hundred, but | only wanna pay a hundred and fifty for it. These, they look more like it. Six hundred and eighty-five. How much off for the police force? Why should | knock off anything just because you're a policeman? Thought you might wanna try and bribe me. I'm always readin' about cops being bribed. I've got more influential friends than you in the Boy Scouts. Ah, come on, Fred, make me a deal. You know Mary, you oughta cut the price in half. I've known Mary since she was eight years old, and the price is still six hundred and eighty-five bucks. -How do you sleep at night, Fred? -Just fine, thanks. How much, cash? How much you got? -About three hundred. -It's yours. Wrap it up. Stay back! All right, drop it. Don't turn, just drop it. I'm Lieutenant Henderson, 21st Precinct. My badge is in my right pocket. Get it out. Toss it back here. Okay, Lieutenant. I'm Johnny Damico, detective third, from the 6th Precinct. Who's the pigeon? Tony Rogers. He shot up one of my men about two hours ago. -Hey, what's happening? -You got a phone? - Yeah. - I'll call in, Damico. All right, get outta here. Go on, get out. What happened? -All right. Get back, get back. -What is it? You, too, nosy. Or did you shoot this guy? No. Lieutenant Henderson shot him. He's callin' in. I'm Johnny Damico, 6th Precinct. -Gerrity, Bill Gerrity. Is he...? -Yeah, he sure is. -Hey, you made good time. -What's up? Just a small killing. Funny nothing came over the radio on this. What do you mean, nothing came over? How'd you get here? We were just cruising. Call it in. I'll be right back. Hey, what's goin' on out there? Where's the man that just came in here to make the phone call? -Phone call? -Yeah. -Big fella, trench coat, black hair. -Oh, him. He just walked in the front door and went out the back. Lieutenant Banks. -Lieutenant Banks. -Lieutenant, this is Damico. -Yeah? -I'm at a shooting on West 63rd. It just came in over the radio. What are you doing there? | saw the whole thing. Big fella shot a little fella, and | pulled a gun on him. -In the best tradition. -Well, he flashed a badge, said he was Lieutenant Henderson, 21st Precinct. Little fella was Tony Rogers, and he'd just killed a cop. | searched the dead guy. He was carrying identification. Edward Jensen, 1911 Inland Avenue. -What's that name again? -Edward Jensen. Where is this Lieutenant Henderson? He jumped into a lunch room to phone. | find out he went out the back door. Johnny, you're kidding! | know it sounds like a bonehead play, Lieutenant, but the badge he flashed was the McCoy, and he was carrying a police revolver. Get down here right away, Johnny. Is it bad? Right away, Johnny. Okay. And you even hand him back his gun. Why didn't you give him train fare? But I'm tellin' you that badge was real! You couldn't fool me with a tin job. Sure, it was real. It was taken off the body of Lieutenant Meary by the guy who murdered him three hours before. | didn't hear about any killin'. | was off duty. You know who Edward Jensen was? -No. -You should. Jensen was a principal witness in the Grand Jury investigation of the waterfront rackets. Lieutenant Meary was a special investigator assigned on that case. The guy with the badge? Your description is the same as Meary gave us, just before he died. | shoulda gone fishing. | called the Commissioner and the District Attorney while you were on your way down. They wanna see you tomorrow morning. Pretty upset? Don't count on your pension. Well, the Army's always waiting. I'll do what I can, Johnny. Thanks. -Where are you going? -1 got a date with Mary. Not any more. I've got an artist waiting to work with you. See if you can't get something that looks like your pal. Well, that won't take long. I'll phone her. And | don't want you to leave here tonight. -But why hang around? -That's an order. We'll go to the Commissioner's office together in the morning. Okay. Weight, approximately 160 pounds. Height, approximately five feet eleven. This is gonna be a big help! I'm sorry, Commissioner, it was the best | could do. It was dark, and raining, and after he showed me the badge, | didn't pay too much attention to him. You should be back patrolling vacant lots. A man commits a murder right in front of your own eyes. You tip your hat, shine his shoes, and send him off with his hot little gun still in his hands! -You're suspended for sixty days. -Yes, sir. That's only for publication, however. Instead of actually suspending you, we're gonna give you a chance to get yourself killed. We want this man awfully bad. And I'm stuck with you, because you're the only one who knows anything about what he looks like. No record? No record, no pictures, no prints, no anything. Meary gave us the name Blackie Clegg. Our boys have been hearing the name around the waterfront the last couple of weeks. Sit down, Damico. Yes, sir. What do you know about this waterfront setup? Very little, sir. I'm not surprised at that. But, anyway, your job is to bring in Blackie Clegg. | think we should brief him, just for background, but Radford can handle the racket end. About three months ago, the union came to us, and asked our help in getting rid of the racketeers who worked their way into the waterfront. Meary, who was killed last night, and Radford here, were assigned to the case. - How do the rackets work? - They got a hundred angles. Kickbacks from everybody workin' on the docks. Highly organised thefts from loadings and unloadings that bring 'em in about fifty million a year. Contributions. | could go on for hours. We began getting withesses from the truckmen, the steamship lines, and the longshoremen. Enough to convene a Grand Jury and start presenting evidence. Then they evidently sent out some new boy to take over. Things began to tighten up, but we still had enough to go ahead. -Jensen was our prize witness. -And Meary was one of our best men. How far had Meary gotten? | don't know for sure. We were working separately. But pretty near the top, | guess. He scared somebody. This Blackie Clegg, he's the new boss? That's what Meary said. You don't have anything on him? We know someone who might be able to identify him. -Who's that? -You. -How do | work? -We'll get everything set up for you. You will be Tim Flynn, a middle-sized crook from New Orleans. We'll have the New Orleans Police phoney up a record for you in case anybody checks. What have | done? A few misdemeanours, and a manslaughter rap. We'll arrange for you to fly to New Orleans tonight. Get aboard a boat, work your way back up here. It'll take about a week. Make sure you're noticed plenty on that boat. These boys probably check on anything they think looks suspicious. Yell for all the help you need, and keep reporting in. Another man can pick up, in case you're knocked off. That's a cheery thought. It's no stroll in the park. And don't forget, Damico, Clegg saw as much of you last night as you did of him. Already thought of that, Commissioner. Also thought of somethin' else. There's another guy got a better look at him last night than | did. -Who's that? -The lunchroom proprietor. He won't be much help. We picked him up dead in an alley at four o'clock this morning. Clegg's a little gun happy, isn't he? Remember that when you're prowling around late at night. Yes, sir. Whose picture is that? That? Oh, that's old Heathcliffe Damico, he's an uncle of mine. He operates a string of girdle factories at Pompton Lakes. -Look, I'm not really suspended. -Well, then why the story? Detective mumbo jumbo. Your friends'll know that isn't your picture. I'm not expecting any trouble from my friends. -It's late, I've gotta get back. -Wait a minute. It's beautiful, Johnny. The budget must've groaned and cracked a little. | just sold some of my oil interests, and there it was. -Oh, | love it! -Good. Do | see you later tonight? No, Mary. As a matter of fact, maybe not for a couple of weeks. Why? Well, | have to go underground. You know, like gophers and Communists. Something to do with the story in the paper? Yeah. Can't you tell me anything? I'd rather not. Don't worry. | won't. If you loved me, you would. This is almost as nice as the ring you promised me when we were first engaged. And remember, lady, that's not just a present. That means that $685 of you belongs to me from here on in. -Really? -Mm-hmm. Fred told me he gave it to you for $300. Mary... a successful marriage is based on a wife letting her husband lie a little. Now, let's not get started on the wrong foot. Yeah? This John Damico, 6th Precinct? -Yeah, that's right. -Ted Karpel of the Herald. | thought if you were going to be around for a while I'd come over to have a talk with you -What about? -I'd like to get a story. You gonna be there? -Yeah, sure, I'll be here. -Okay, I'll be right over. - Evening Herald. - City desk, please. - City desk. - Let me speak to Ted Karpel. -Who? -Ted Karpel, he's a reporter. Well not on this newspaper, he isn't. -Are you sure? -Sure, I'm sure. Who's this? Thanks. -Lieutenant Banks. -Lieutenant Banks. Lieutenant, | just got a phoney call. There'll be a couple of guys with guns at my place in a few minutes. Probably from Blackie Clegg. Get a car over here right away, and see if you can't squeeze some information out of them. Hold it, Johnny. Get a car out in front, right away. Okay, Johnny. I'll stick around till they get here, then I'm off to the airport. -You'll here from me next week. -Right, Johnny. | don't know who signed you aboard, Flynn, but if you ever try to get back again... Me try to get back on this turtle? I'd rather have typhoid. You've been a troublemaker the whole trip. | should have kept you in the brig. | wouldn'ta had to see so much of you. Get this straight, I'm puttin' the word out about you. -I'll remember your face. -I'll try to forget yours. Get off! Hey, you guys. You'd better drop that work and lay down a red carpet! You got a tough boy from New Orleans invadin' your town. -Hey, who are these guys? -Longshoremen, stupid. No kiddin'! | thought they were a bunch of stranded chorus boys. Wanna room? Nah, | just came in to admire the decorations. Three bucks a day. What's that include? Sheets on the bed. You got a register? Don't be funny. Here, take my stuff upstairs. This ain't the Waldorf, friend. How long d'ya work here before you found that out? Keep an eye on this, I'm gonna have a drink. Any more orders, Princess? Yeah, my name is Tim Flynn. When the mayor comes with my key to the city, ask him to join me in the Orchid Room. Creep. What'll it be? White wine and beer. -Come again? -White wine and beer. -Mixed together?! -No, a glass of each. That beats me! | had a nut ask me once for a glass of gin and a candy bar. This is a new one. | knew guys who used to drink white wine and beer. Down in New Orleans. I've spent some time there. Have a drink? Thanks. Beer, Smoothie. My name's Clancy. -Tim Flynn. -How are ya? Yeah, that's a great town, New Orleans. | had a girl there once, used to lay the piano with her teeth. With her teeth?! Yeah. Well, she had kinda long, brown teeth. Sounds like some of the dogs I've run into. How long you been away? Just got in twenty minutes ago. Yeah, | was there when you got off the boat. Some of the boys were thinkin' about pleatin' your chin for the crack you made. The boys shouldn't be so sensitive. -You check in this place? -Yeah, how is it? When the tenement crowd goes slumming, they come here. Aw, it ain't that bad. I'd rather have a sleeping bag in a sewer. You gonna be around for a while, Clancy? Yeah, maybe. Why? Keep my drink warm for me, | wanna get settled in my room. That's a howl, callin' it a room. Have a drink on me while you're waiting. White wine and beer! Don't let it flip ya, Smoothie. | knew a guy used to drink vodka and goat milk. Bring me another beer over to the table here, huh? Lieutenant Banks. -Lieutenant Banks. -Lieutenant, this is Damico. | checked into the Royal Hotel at 10th and Walton. Say, did you get anything out of those two guys you picked up at my apartment? No, I put a tail on 'em when we let 'em go, but they left town right away. Well, look, I'm applying for my work permit tomorrow. Now, play it cagey and make sure | don't have any trouble getting it. And listen, Lieutenant, put my calls on tape from now on. | might be in a hurry and won't be able to repeat. Oh, and another thing. Why did you have to pick New Orleans? | hate white wine and beer! So, | laid it right on the line to this dame. | says, "Honey, if it's a millionaire you're after, "you've been diggin' in the wrong pea patch. "So get that champagne look outta your eye "and finish your beer." How'd she take it? Well, she didn't. Next day she headed for Canada, with my cuff links, my car, and a mink-dyed hamster coat I'd bought in Atlantic City. What are my chances of gettin' some work on the docks? You got a union card? Yeah, from New Orleans. Well, you might get a visitor's permit, but | doubt it. Couldn't you fix it? Might be worth somethin' to me. Why? Ya hidin' out? A little money usually fixes anything, Clancy. Not around here. What's so different about here? Well, this waterfront is tight as a two-bit collar. They don't like strangers too much. I'm just askin' about a job. Maybe. You can't give me any help, hmm? Let's just say | won't give any help. | don't get it. Why all the mystery? Let's talk some more about women. | knew a little chick from Detroit... Look, | need a job. You know, there's somethin' funny about a guy that breaks his neck gettin' a job breakin' his back. Maybe I like hard work. | thought you said you were Irish. All right, Clancy. | got into a little trouble in New Orleans. Nothin' serious, but | wanna lay low for a couple of months. They'll check on anything you say around here. Who'll check. Who're you talkin' about? Then | met this girl from Alabama. She was a muscle dancer in a charity bazaar. Buy another beer, I'll tell you all about her. Buy two beers, and I'll give you her address. Dock gang number 12, report to Miriam, berth 145 at 8:45 a.m. Hey, Mac. Where do | see about a work permit? -Over at the end window. -Thanks. Ship gang number 14 report to Portus, berth 147 at 10:30 a.m. Yeah? | got a card from New Orleans, | wanna get a visitor's permit. -Funny guy. -What's funny about it? | need a job. Try the government, buddy. We don't have anything here. -Now, listen, Buster! -Maybe you don't hear so good. | said there wasn't anything. We haven't issued a new permit for three months. Well, it's about time you started. Those are in good order. I'm in good standing. Hey, you heard him. And don't start any trouble. Get goin'. | said "get goin Man number 50, report to dock gang number 12, Miriam, berth 145 at 08:45 a.m. -Hey you! You from New Orleans. -Yeah? Ship gang number 22, report to cashier. -Forgot your book. -Thanks for nothin'. You must be half Irish and half Congressman to get that permit so easy. A dollar a day paves the way. What happens now? -Willie Alessandro breaks a leg. -Yeah? What's that mean? You're just about to find out. No need for you guys to hang around. You're not workin' today, or any other day. What's the matter with them? They're troublemakers. They want a full day's pay without any kick-back. All right, marbleheads. Now, shut up and listen to me. We need forty strong backs on this job, and | mean strong. Two days' work, unload today and load tomorrow. Overtime tomorrow, and after eight hours today. Now, we don't need any brains on this job, so them here that can't stand hard work, shove off! Makes you feel right at home, doesn't he? Now, | want guys who will co-operate. And, speaking of co-operation, you all know Willie Alessandro got his leg busted this mornin'. The fourth leg for Willie this week. Now, Willie's a good guy. He's got a wife and four kids. But now, with a busted leg, Willie can't work. So, when you come up here to get your tags, I'm askin' all of you who wanna work to kick in a little somethin' into the pot we're gettin' up for Willie Alessandro. Don't let me hear no trouble! Joe over here will be glad to help them of ya that don't have the money. What's he mean, "help"? He lends you four bucks for Willie this morning. You give him back five when you get paid this afternoon. What a ten cent racket! Well, it's only cigarette money for the boys, but it amounts to over $200,000 a year. Who gets the money? Whadda you care? You wanna work"? Yeah, sure. Let's go. Don't forget poor Willie, or they'll ride you home on your face. Let's give Willie five bucks this time. He's had a lotta hard luck. -You got a card? -Yeah. "Tim Flynn." You're new around here. -Brand new. -Where'd'ya come from? I'm a socialite who'd like to try his hand at hard work. Who got you the book? The guy that told me to keep my mouth shut. Whaddaya mean, "told you to keep your mouth shut"? -That's what the man said. -What man? That's what he told me to keep my mouth shut about. Was it Joe Castro? Maybe it was Joe Castro's boss. Take this over. Come on, Flynn. You know what you're talkin' about? All | know is | wanna go to work. "Castro's boss," huh? It's pretty rough work on the docks. You know how to run one of these? Sure. | ran one in the army. It's better work than wrestlin' boxes. Hey, Culio. You better know what you're talkin' about. Flynn here's takin' over your lift today. You go on down and unload with the rest. Whaddya mean, he's takin' over? That's my job! Not any more it ain't. -Where do you think you get off... -Shut up! You wanna work, get on down there. If you don't, beat it! You and me are gonna have a small talk later on. I'll be busy thinkin' up things to say. Come on, Flynn, I'll put you to work. Now, go on, beat it! And let's have a full day's work for a full day's pay. Hey, Flynn. It's kind of a nice job you turned over to me. | don't know how you pulled it, brother, but | don't wanna see you back here tomorrow. Better not look too hard, because here's where I'll be. Maybe you need a little smartenin' up. When | do, I'll get a smart boy to do it. Lucky I didn't break your neck. You want some more, get up! You can tell your friend Castro | don't like being pushed out of a good job. | may have a few things to say to a few people. You'd better take your sorority sister home, boys. | think she's had a very hard day. So, you end up your busy little day with a street brawl, huh? | was just workin' up an appetite. What's your angle, Flynn? Where do you get your drag? No drag. People like my personality. You ask a lot of questions, but you seem to know more answers than any of us. | don't know a thing. All | did was get myself a job and take care of some sorehead who tried to object. Could be. If you're afraid to be seen with me, move on down the bar. Oh, no, no. I'm not afraid, just curious. They don't pass out soft jobs down here without some reason. The guy asked me a silly question about a jerk named Castro. | never heard of him. -You sure? -Sure, I'm sure. So | give him a silly answer about Castro's boss, and, bingo, I'm in a feather-bed job. Maybe you oughta try it yourself. No. No, | work hard, but I'm healthy. I'm poor, but I'm alive. More double talk. Maybe you'll wish it was. Why don't you buy another drink while your money's still some good to ya? Hiya, Flynn. | got a little invitation to a party for ya. RSVP. Sure, I'll go right home and change. This is sort of a come-as-you-are party. Get In. -Have you got a girl for me? -No, this is stag. Do | know any of the people giving the party? You will. Will I like 'em? Now, how could you help it? They're a bunch of jolly good fellows. Aren't you gonna blindfold me? You've been reading too many comic books. Straight ahead. Open it. You're just in time. This him? Yeah, that's the guy. Frisk him. Get your hands off of me, sucker. Mister, you're a riot. We don't use the honour system here. Now, is this any way to dress for a party? Look at this, Boss, a water pistol. Well, whaddaya know? It makes a noise. Let him go. Sit down. -Who are you? -The man said "sit down"! Listen, Strongheart, just sit still and answer questions. You've been shootin' off your mouth for two days around here. Who told you to use my name at the docks? Oh, you must be Castro's boss. I'm Castro, and | don't have any boss. Not even a wife, Mr Castro? We don't want you to entertain until later. Tell this ape to lay off of me, Castro! Or what?! What's this all about? So, | shot my mouth off around the docks. | needed a job! | heard somebody mention your name and | used it. All right, I'm sorry. -Get me a beer. -We're out of beer, Boss. Go get some! | want that gun when | leave. Sure. When ya leave. | don't like fresh guys messin" around my docks. Now, one way or another, you're gonna answer a few questions. Make it easy on yourself. You've been gone a half an hour. | had to chase clear over to 18th Street to get some cold beer. How's old, fun-loving Flynn? Open it. Flynn's okay. He's on the lam from New Orleans. And you believe him? Yeah. He made a little mistake, but | don't think he'll do that again. Will ya, Flynn? Not unless it's a mistake to take this guy apart. Gunner was just followin' orders. Gunner's gonna run into me one of these days without any help. | like this boy. He's got character. -Have a beer. -I'd rather get some sleep. Okay, Flynn. You can go. No hard feelings. -Give him his gun. -Sure. You must use that to keep flies out of your room. -Look me up sometime, Gunner. -You're a laugh a minute, kid. Forget about tonight, Flynn. Okay. -Well? -It's all fixed. Clean up this room. And patch up that hole. Tote that barge! Well, you must be worn out at night. Why work, when gasoline'll do it for ya? It's nice of you to talk to us labourers. Just don't perspire on my machine, boy. See ya later. Hey. -You Tim Flynn? -Yeah. -You live at the Royal Hotel? -That's right. -Okay, come on. -What's the idea? You got in a fight yesterday with a guy named Culio. Fight? It was more like a waltz. Don't tell me he called the cops. -Seen him today? -No. | don't wonder. He was murdered last night at 11:30. Shot with a .32 automatic. We found this in your room. One bullet fired. Come on. Don't start any trouble. You got the wrong town to try this, buddy. Come on. Get everything. All right, Flynn, let's have it. Have what? Don't get me sore, | don't wanna waste any time on ya. I'm ready to leave any time you are. Now, look, Flynn, you can make it easy or hard. Me, | don't care which way it is. Why d'ya kill Culio? - I didn't. -You had a fight with him. Maybe he got sore and came after ya? Was it self-defence? | never saw the guy after the fight. Get up. All right, lean forward on your two forefingers. Hold it there. This won't be the most fun you've ever had. In a few minutes, you'll be yellin' for help. Why don't you save yourself some trouble and talk now? | got nothin' to say. Maybe you knew him before, down in New Orleans. That's where you're from, isn't it? My name is Timothy Flynn and | want a lawyer! You might be interested to know that we got orders from higher up to be pretty rough on you waterfront rats. I'd like to talk to you alone, Sergeant. Why alone? Don't you like my friends? Think | can tell ya somethin' might interest ya. You bet you can, and you're gonna start right now. -Alone, Sergeant. -Not on your life. You don't get any breaks, because you've been steppin' on the wrong toes ever since you got in town. Who do you mean? Castro? Never mind who | mean. Have you bothered to check my gun against the bullet found in Culio's body? We will, soon as we get your confession. I'd check it right now, 'cause they won't match up. | got pretty good information that they will. Next time you see your information, tell him I'm not hick enough to let somebody wonder around town carryin' my gun. Whaddaya mean? I'm trying to tell you the gun and the bullet won't match. Send that gun to Ballistics. | wouldn't want to spend your next few hours if you're lyin'. I'm not lyin'. And another thing, Bennion, tell your friends their frame was strictly bush league. Shut up about my friends. Up on your fingers! We haven't even started with you. Here's the noon report from the precincts. What's up? Everything's pretty quiet. 15th picked up a man on that waterfront Killing last night. Anybody we know? No, some out-of-towner from New Orleans. Come on now, you've had an hour of this. It oughta be enough. Why don't you wait for the ballistics report? | don't care anything about that, | wanna hear what you gotta say. So, it's beginning to get ya. All right, straighten up. Let him alone. You're not gonna get anyplace that way, Sergeant. Give me a little more time. Forget it. I'll take him down to headquarters with me. Now, wait a minute, Lieutenant, we made this pinch. I'll see you get full credit for it. Here's the ballistics report. -Well? -It's not the same gun. Do you still want credit, Sergeant? You better clean him up before | take him down and book him for having a gun without a permit. | hope you enjoyed the parlour tricks. Sorry, but | couldn't act too anxious to get you outta there. I'd put a tail on that Sergeant Bennion who picked me up. He's tied in with the mob, whoever they are. -You sure? -Sure enough to want him followed. Nice work in ditching the murder gun. I'da had to been a slow twelve years old to fall for that one. | fired a bullet from this gun so they wouldn't catch on. What'd you do with the first gun? Mailed it to you. What about the killing? That was done by a character called Gunner. Why was Culio killed? He made a crack about doin' some talkin' after our fight, so they figured on gettin' rid of him and me at the same time. Johnny, if you'd like us to put somebody else on this with you... No, no, no, no. I'll pick up Gunner. Anyway, | feel I'm beginning to get someplace. Where? | want you to check on a guy called Thomas Clancy. Okay. Do you have anything on a Joe Castro? Not much. We figure he's about fifth man from the top. -Well, | figure he's closer than that. -What about Blackie Clegg? | haven't even heard his name mentioned. Everybody's too scared. You know, if we ever snag that Sergeant, | get ten minutes alone with him. If he's crooked, you can have ten days. One crummy, crooked cop, and he can smell up the whole force. -When do you wanna be released? -Right now. I'm anxious to start workin' my way right back to that Sergeant. -Up and at 'em, Russell. -Well, whaddaya know! | was just readin' about ya in the paper. | figured they was parboilin' ya for the chair. I'm goin' in to get a drink. That should give you time enough to put back the stuff you probably stole from my room. There was nothin' there worth stealin'. Put it back, anyway. -On the house. -Thanks. | guess Bennion and his boys had some fun with ya. I'll get him alone sometime. That kind always travel in bunches. You hear a lot of stuff around the bar, don't ya, Smoothie? | don't listen very hard. Sure you do. Whaddaya hear? Well, some of the boys say you were framed. And not very good, at that. | want you to pass this along so it'll get back to the right places. I'm a little peeved with the boys that did it. Know who they are? Yeah, | know who they are, but | don't know where to find 'em. Do you ever sell information, Smoothie? Not me. It'd be worth five bucks if | could find out where | could run into a certain guy. Ask somebody else. Ten. It ain't healthy, Flynn. Twenty bucks, or do | go someplace else? -Who do you wanna know about? -A guy they call Gunner. The college thug? Anybody coulda told you. He hangs out every night in a little club called the Black Kitten. It's on 18th. Twenty bucks, please. -You wouldn't cross me, pop? -I don't cross nobody. I'd bounce you around like a basketball. | gave it to ya straight. Don't bother to pick me up. My party tonight, Gunner. | heard you were out, Flynn. That smells mighty like a cop to me. Let's go across the street. | never argue with a man who's giving a party. Castro should have let me get you but good the other night. He's got more sense than you've got. Turn around. You gonna knock me off, or pinch me? Maybe neither one. | wanna ask you a couple of questions about a friend of yours. Sure. -Blackie Clegg. -Whaddaya wanna know? -Lieutenant Banks. -Lieutenant, this is Damico. All right. The boy you want in the Culio killing's tied up in a construction job on 18th Street, across from the Black Kitten. Hold it, Johnny. Get a car out in front, right away. Okay, Johnny. Lieutenant, don't let anything out about his arrest. And, whatever you do, don't let anybody spring him. If you do, I'll be dead ten minutes later. -We'll keep him buried. -Did you get anything on Clancy? We can't find a thing. Maybe he's using a phoney name. Yeah, well, put a tail on him, I'm gonna sleep for eighteen hours. Hey! Flynn! Over here. | heard you'd applied for a permanent position at Leavenworth. | didn't qualify. -Who sprung ya? -My mother. Your mother must get around, the way you walk in and out of soft jobs and jails. If you're tr yin' to pump me, you're gonna have to do a lot better than that. I'm just tr yin' to get the formula. They throw away the key on me if | get a traffic ticket. There's no formula. They just found out | didn't do it. -Okay, don't get sore. -You're too nosy. Now, don't be like that. | was just gonna invite you to a party tonight. - I need that like I need the plague. -You don't like parties? I've been to a couple lately that were pretty rough. This might turn out that way, too. I've lined up two of the cutest gals you ever saw. And you wanna share 'em with me? Well, two are worse than none. Well, why pick on me? You got a lot of other friends. Well, if getting you a cute girl is pickin' on ya, I've been taking an awful beatin' since | was thirteen. Who are the girls? Now, would you know any more if | gave you their names? They're women. What more do you want? Free dishes? Well, | could use a little fun. What time? I'll meet you at Pine and 4th Street at 9:30. Hey, don't stand me up. | couldn't handle both of 'em. Clancy wants you to get him drunk. Play up to him. -Get everything you can out of him. -Who is he? Clancy didn't say. Just said he might be dangerous to him. -What am | supposed to find out? -Everything you can. What he's doing around the docks. What his connections are. Fine job to give to his sister. Why don't you do it? Because it's a worse job to give to his wife. -You know how jealous Clancy is. -Yeah. You gonna wear your wedding ring? No. Thanks for reminding me. Here he is now. How are you, girls? Sorry to keep you waiting. This is Tim Flynn. Tim, this is Peggy. And that's Doris, she belongs to you. But suppose | like Peggy better? Now, wait a minute, pal. Ah, come on, Clancy, you're not gonna get stuffy on me, are ya? It's just that | got kind of a weakness for blondes. So have I! Yeah, but this is sort of my coming out party. There's nothin' the matter with Doris! No, of course not. You'll have fun. Oh, come on Clancy, what difference does it make? You like Doris. And | think he's kind of cute. Why can't he like Doris? -Why can't somebody? -Oh, sit down, Clancy. We'll have a real good time, honey. Yeah, sure. Tell me all about yourself, Tim. Oh, | come from an ordinary, everyday family. My mother was an oil heiress, my father was a Zeppelin pilot. Did they ever marry? It's been awfully dry sitting here waiting for you. Yeah, sure, let's have some drinks. -Yes sir, what'll it be? -Who's buying? | am. Cheap bourbon and plain water. Make it four. Well, what's on the programme tonight? Well, | thought we might have a few drinks and go up to your place. -Trying to save money again? -We'll bring a bottle. -What do you say, Tim? -You lead, I'll follow. You see what nice things he says, Clancy? You and | are going to get along fine. That thought has already crossed my mind. Well, say something to me. Hmm? Oh, how ya been? Why don't you loosen up tonight? Let's take a cab. Listen, a streetcar was good enough for my grandfather. Well, it's not good enough for me. -Aren't we gonna eat? -Eat? What's that? That's something people who don't drink do. Come on, let's take a cab. -She acted like she knew you. -Or wished she did. Things must be slow at the hospital. You won't tell me anything about yourself. Why should | talk about me when | got a pretty little thing like you around? Are you in the rackets, Timmy? Let's talk about world affairs. Clancy is. Makes a lot of money. You oughta get in on it. Maybe you oughta talk to Clancy about gettin' me in. You're kidding me. You've probably got a better deal of your own, haven't you? -What color are your eyes? -Can't you tell? Bourbon blue. Where are old Clancy and Doris? They're in the kitchen. Leave 'em alone. You're not just an ordinary longshoreman. Are you, Timmy? -Nope. -What are you? Thirsty. You're cute. Have you two met?! Clancy, my boy! You can think of the most delightful ways to pass the time of night. I'm gonna come to all your parties from now on. Look, run back to your mixmaster and cook up a few more of these. Here, honey. Don't let me outdistance you. I'm with you every step. Not much stamina, has he? We got what we wanted. Anyway, | was tired of him pawing you around. - Jealous? - You can say that again. He's really out. He'll be all right in the morning. Ooh! You must be part of my hangover. You wish! Is that gun loaded? You wanna find out? No, I'm happier just guessin'. Where's Gunner? -Who? -You know who | mean! If you mean that dim bulb who pushed me around... Where is he? How should | know? That's your problem. You haven't seen him? No. How come this was in your bureau drawer? Well, you certainly tripped me up there, didn't ya? | didn't come up here to trade jokes with ya. Now, come on, where is he? | told ya | didn't like people who push me around. -You killed him? -He's not around, is he? You oughta be glad it wasn't you, after that two-bit frame you tried to pull. A real tough guy, aren't ya? With my hangover... no. Come on, get up. | don't wanna. Okay, sucker. Take it right here. You'll make a lotta noise. Nobody in this dump will care about that. Yeah, you've got a point there. What'd you do with Gunner's body? Floated it down the sewer. | thought so. -All right, get movin'. -Now that he's gone, I'd like to apply for Gunner's job with your organisation. | said, get goin'! I'd be a good boy for ya, Castro. My car's in the back. We'll use those stairs. -Where are we goin'? -It won't matter to you. I'd fit into your gang perfectly. | could maim and disfigure people for ya, -and shoot up the ones you don't like. -Get goin'! | think you're makin' a big mistake, Castro. I'm no good to ya dead. He musta bumped his head on somethin'. Yeah. It's upstairs, to your right. C'mon, gimme a hand. We'll get him back to your room. You must be part Marine to turn up in the nick of time like this. I've been listening outside your door. Lucky I did before | knocked, huh? The final drink you gave me last night must have been radioactive. Yeah, it's an invention of my own. | call that "Old Bikini". I'm sorry about last night, Damico. Come on, come on, Damico. Let's stop playing footsie with each other. You're a cop, working out of the 6th Precinct, on the Blackie Clegg business. Now, don't try anything. I'm pretty quick with a blackjack. -Maybe we'll find out. -Why? I'm on your side. Yeah? Who are you? Like they say on those corny television programmes... Special Investigator. Where's your beard? | rigged it up to get your prints off one of those glasses last night, and sent 'em through to Washington. Imagine my surprise when you turned out to be a flatfoot. Why don't they tell us these things? We go around gumshoeing after each other. Clancy... Haven't had a chance to send your prints in yet. I've had a guy tailing you for two days. | know. That's why | wanted to find out a few things. Did you have to slug me with that poison to do it? No, that was just to teach you not to play around with my wife. Your what? The plan was for my sister, Doris, to do your entertaining, but you had crum things up and pick my wife. You're lucky | didn't tear your arm off. We must do that again real soon. Yeah, that's what Peggy said this morning. What are you workin' on down here? A phoney insurance swindle. The Alta Indemnity Company. They took about half a million. -Maybe you heard of 'em, huh? -Nope. It was worked by a gang of four. We got 'em all except the big boy, a fellow named Humbert. Got a line on him? If that's not him on the bed, I'll turn in my Dick Tracy badge. How'd you track him down? By every scientific device known to modern crime investigators. And the fact that a stool pigeon told us where he was. Why didn't you close in sooner? | couldn't find him. Only recently learned he was using the name Castro, so... when | heard you drop his name at the dock, | figured you'd lead me to him, sooner or later. Whaddaya know about Blackie Clegg, Clancy? Can't give you a bit of help. I've heard his name a coupla times, that's about all. You gonna keep workin' round here? Not me. That's the chump we're after. I'll take him in, and then devote a month to patching up my shattered marriage. I'll put in a call for the boys come and pick him up. That's great. Why don't you just shoot me yourself, and save Castro's gang the trouble? Got any ideas? Well, keep it quiet, and give me as much time as you can. How am | gonna get him outta here? Castro's got a car in the back. Use that. Should have taken up my offer, Castro. Come on, get up. Sure you don't need any help? If | do, I'd better go back to jerking sodas. Sweat him a little, see if you can't get some information for me. You won't get anything. We'll try real hard. I'll turn everything | get over to your boss. -Don't drink any loaded drinks. -Give my love to your wife. -Hey, Flynn. -Yeah? Smoothie wants to see ya. -What about? -How should | know? -Maybe he's buying. -Then what are you doin' here? I'll be off duty at eight o'clock, Flynn. Congratulations. There's a man who wants to see you. That shouldn't be too hard. I'm usually around here. He's too big a man for that. He wants me to bring you to him. -Well, maybe | don't wanna go. -Ah, ¢'mon, Flynn. It means twenty bucks for me, if | deliver you. Well, you could at least offer to split with me. Well, there's ten thousand in it for you. Straight whisky, Smoothie. Who is the guy? He'll tell you when he sees you. -Where do | meet ya? -Right here. My car's across the street in the gas station. I'm goin' upstairs and get some sleep. If I'm not down here by seven, send Russell up to bang on the door. -Are you sure you weren't followed? -Please... What's so important? I'm making a command appearance in front of one of the big boys tonight. -Who? -Maybe the jackpot, | dunno. Where do you see him? The bartender at my rest home is driving me over. What about this bartender? Well, he says he's a go-between for twenty bucks. | wouldn't doubt it. Could we get to his car? It's in a gas station across the street from the hotel. -How much time do we have? -Mmm, couple of hours. -We'll put a transmitter in his car. -Why? He may let something drop. And in case anything happens to you, we'd like to know what it is. And we'll put a tail on you. Look, if they catch on, we're back at the beginning. They won't. We'll use a fluorescent marker can. All right. Just don't follow too close. Give you about ten minutes. You know, | got a hunch this is it. Be careful. Yeah, sure. I'll carry real bullets in my gun. Hey, Smoothie, you got a flat on the right-rear of your car. -It was all right this morning. -Probably a slow leak. Want me to fix it? Well, I've gotta use it in about forty minutes. -Er... put on the spare. -Okay. Smoothie! Couple of beers! -You've only got forty minutes. -1 think we can make it. You'd better change that tyre, in case he decides to check. Paul, you handle the marker can under the right-rear fender. Connect it to the ignition switch. Talbert, you and I'll work on the transmitter. We'll put it under the floor board. And the mic goes under the glove compartment. Okay, disconnect it. Hand me that ultraviolet lamp. Let's go. We'll wait here. Are you set down there? Ready here. Turn on the ignition switch, and I'll see if it works. Here goes. Shut it off. All set. -You'd better hurry up. -Okay. All ready to contact Mobile Units, Lieutenant. Mobile Unit Two. Mobile Unit Two. This is Mobile Two. Keep cruising and be ready to jump in with a fix anytime I ask you. Right. That goes for you, too, Mobile Three. Okay, Lieutenant. Tune your antenna. Antenna tuned. That should do it. Lieutenant Banks -should be receiving us now. -They made it. Here they come. All fixed, Smoothie. I'll put it on your bill. All right, Tom. Listen. We wait ten minutes. Trust a bartender to know all the right people. You pick up a lot of things on a job like that. You mentioned something about $10,000. Let's dwell on that for a minute. Well, this man has a job for you. He likes the way you work. How does he know about me? He checked on your record in New Orleans. What work of mine does he admire? The way you took care of Gunner after he framed you. - Who said | took care of him? - Didn't you? Smoothie... It couldn't be that you're a cop, could it? No, it couldn't. | didn't take care of anybody. Have it your way. He's not around anymore, that's all | know. All right, let's go. Hit your ultra-violet light. There it is. Tell me about this man. He wants to see you. Is he really big? The biggest. What does he want me to do? Kill a cop. Is that all? Well, that's why it's worth ten thousand bucks. Just any cop, or does he have someone in mind? We have someone in mind. IIWell? Well, as you said, a bartender knows all the right people. Circle around. Cut on down the way we were going. And hurry up! What dumb, crummy luck! Pull over to the kerb. Mobile Units Two and Three, report in. Mobile Unit Two, at 63rd and Downing Streets. Mobile Unit Three, at Sycamore and Langley. All right. Stay where you are. We'll use that as a baseline. I'll triangulate it from here. As soon as they get where they're going, give me their bearings from your position. Is there anything else you wanna tell me? You'll find out everything you need to know when we get there. - Are you receiving them all right? - Loud and clear. Same here. All right, draw your baseline. Come on, this is it. Why couldn't we meet him in a more lighted spot? This is the back door of the house. We'll go up to his apartment. Answer me one question, Smoothie. Is this guy Blackie Clegg? Where'd you hear that name? Around the docks. The boys say he runs things. The boys are right, but they shouldn't talk so much. Come on. Mobile Units Two and Three. They're at their destination. Report on your bearings. This is Mobile Unit Two. Our bearing is 74 degrees. This is Mobile Unit Three. Our bearing is... | guess you two know each other. -Yeah, | guess we do. -How are ya, Flynn? I'm not in the mood for any finger exercises, Bennion. It's no fun, is it? Glad you're gonna be with us, Flynn. - I don't get it. Is he Blackie Clegg?? -Are you kidding? Bennion runs errands around here. Sit down. -Where's Clegg, then? -He'll show up in a minute. -Maybe | oughta give you a rundown first. -On what? This job he wants done. That is, if you're interested. Well, that depends. Knockin' off cops is a tricky pastime. They take a bullet just like anyone else. Yeah, but more people seem to resent it. $10,000 isn't exactly starvation wages. No, you can buy a lot of smiles with it. This won't be tough at all. There's the boy we want. -He doesn't look impossible. -It's a deal, then? No, | wanna talk to the man who wants it done. -He can hear us. - I want that to work both ways. Well, | can make the deal for him. No, not for me. I'll deal with the chairman of the board, or nobody. All right, fix yourself a drink and I'll get him. Thanks. They're in the vicinity of 68th and Charleston, Lieutenant. Mobile Units, this is Lieutenant Banks. They're near 68th and Charleston. Let's get that whole area sealed off. W atch for his car. It's a '46 Ford Coupe, licence number 7X8576. Come on in, Flynn, and meet Blackie Clegg. | must be kinda slow. | shoulda figured this, Smoothie. Why should you have figured? A lotta smarter people than you haven't. It's a little corny... but it works. You don't have any more tricks, do you? A few. - I haven't said I was in yet. -You don't have to. You're in whether you like it or not. Oh, | see. You wanted to talk to Blackie Clegg. All right, you're doing it. But that automatically puts you on salary. -Okay by me. -That's half the ten grand. You get the rest when the cop turns up gone. Tell me all about this cop. He's been hiding out. | think we'll find out where he is tonight. How? Come on and I'll show you. - Pretty, isn't she? - Yeah, and stubborn! -What does she say? -She hasn't seen him for a couple weeks. Who is she? The cop's girlfriend. How'd you find her? Why? | think I've seen her someplace before. Where? Just let me make sure it's the right girl. She seems to know you. She ought to. | was at a party with her last night. A party? Yeah. You know that fella Clancy I'm always drinkin' with at the bar? -I know him. -He invited me to a party last night. There was a couple of girls, she was one of 'em. Clancy? He doesn't look like the picture in the paper. But if that picture's a phoney, Clancy could be Damico. What have you got to say now, honey? | don't know what you're talking about. Let's get this straight, Miss. We're going to find out where your boyfriend is. If he's going under the name of Clancy now, tell us and we'll drive you right back to the hospital. | don't know anything about any Clancy. He's lying! You're dealing with Blackie Clegg, girlie. you'd better tell him what you know. -Maybe she's forgotten. -Maybe | can help her remember. We'll go back and have a drink. Let us know as soon as you get anything. Let me talk to her. She wouldn't understand you nearly as well as she would him. He's very experienced in this sort of thing. Well, honey, I'm afraid you're gonna get mussed up a little more. Flynn, have you gone nuts? Don't try anything, Smoothie. | was tailed here. - Are you a cop, Flynn? - Without a wig to my name. You must be my friend Damico. Hey, you must have a crystal ball. You were kinda stupid to kick out that light. It won't matter. It already has. I've got the girl, Damico, and I'm gonna back out the door. You'll hit her if you shoot at me. It won't do you any good, Smoothie. There's cops all over the block. Just remember what you'll be shooting at. Come on! Johnny! Never mind, the alley's blocked off. They'll pick 'em up. How many others are in there? - I don't know. I think I got two of "em. -Let's go. -Be careful, Mary's upstairs. -Who? -Mary. -Wait here. Sergeant Bennion came and got me at the hospital. He told me that Johnny Damico had been hurt, and he wanted to see me. | didn't have any reason to suspect anything because he showed me his badge. All right, Mary Let's get her to the hospital. McCullough, put this girl in the car and take her to Harbor Hospital. Yes, sir. Don't leave her until you're sure she's all right. Come on, Mary. Lieutenant, we got that guy out of the car. Do you want to see him? -Bring him in. -Yes, sir. I'll be over as soon as I'm through here. He's got some awful good Scotch. We'll look it over after we talk to him. -Here he is, Lieutenant -That's not him! This is the guy who was in the car. -Where is he, Bennion? -| don't know. | just heard some shots and | tried to get away. Johnny! You promised me ten minutes alone with him! Listen to me, Bennion, every guy on the force is gonna take the rap 'cause you got big and greedy. I'd like to do some work on your fingers. His office safe. There's a door goes out the back. Checked precincts 10 and 12, Lieutenant, still no lead on Blackie Clegg. He'll never get out of town. We've got every bridge, tunnel and road plugged. Maybe he doesn't wanna get outta town. -Then we'll pick him up. -This guy's no schoolboy. That back door through the safe proved that. You sure you hit him? There was blood on the floor, wasn't there? We'll get him. He'll have to go to somebody for help. Maybe, but remember, he can turn up as a redhead or a blond, anything he wants. Here's the report from Washington on those prints we picked up in his office. "No record." You'd better get some sleep, Johnny. But don't go near your apartment. -What about Mary? -I've got men all around the hospital. I'll go over there, then come back here and sleep. -Take a car. -Thanks. -How's it goin', Joe? -Ah, the time flies like a rock. I'm supposed to be lookin' for some bald-headed guy who wouldn't be dumb enough to show up. If you knew as much about that guy as | did, you'd keep your holster unbuttoned. Nurse, where have you got Mary Kiernan tied down? -Room 306. -Thanks. Come in. Nurse. | don't want the patient in room 309 disturbed. He's only in for a medical check-up. Yes, Doctor. The patient in room 309 is not to be disturbed. -You were right, he just came in. -What about the ambulance? It's at the back entrance. -I'm taking an awful chance. -I'm paying an awful price. | had no idea that was the type of work you did for a living. Last night was pretty quiet. Gets downright exciting at times. -Supposing you hadn't turned up? -But | did. | don't have to tell you to keep quiet, Damico. Make any noise and she gets it first. Stand up. Turn around. Open your coat. Now, you take his gun and put it on the bed. Don't stall. Don't reach for the bell or knock anything over. Do what he tells you, Mary. Smart girl. Close the blinds. Now, move back to the bed. -Didn't | wing you last night? -Just a scratch. We got cops around this place like Fort Knox. They're watching for me to break in, not out. Don't make a false move, Damico. Tell them to come in. Come in. Only take a minute. Now, let's see how you're getting along. | think you need some more sedation. I'll go get it, and then the visitors have to leave. We'll wait until she comes back before we go on with our business. -What business is there”? -I don't like to be made out a sucker. Besides that, you two can identify me too easily. How do you figure on getting out of the hospital? The way | came in. An ambulance. You don't miss a trick, do ya? That's how | stay alive. | was in the safe when you told them to take her to the hospital. And that you'd come to see her. | don't think we'll wait for the nurse. Toss me a pillow. Go on over and stand beside her. | knew something was funny as soon as that nurse came in. She's one of our best cops. Didn't she look all right? She used her thumb to feel my pulse. No nurse would ever do that. -She did all right. -Lieutenant... what do you think my chances are of getting a promotion out of this? No! Well, | thought with the added expense of getting married... No! Well, very lucky for me | have an income of my own. -Where did you get that? -Tilting pinball machines. You got that from Clegg, and it belongs to the city. Timmy! I'd just like to see how you're gonna talk your way out of this. SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
