I totally agree. Now that everyone's here, we're going to take a nice picture. Smile everyone. Good idea. Don't make the same mistake again. Don't put your hand in front of the camera. You have a nice ass... I'm Lucas. Good morning. Weren't you expecting me? Good morning. Madam... Madam. Lucas is here. He has arrived. I'm so happy! We were expecting you tomorrow. Nice that you came early. You're to announce "Mr. Lucas is here. " I'm right, no? What are you waiting for? Gina, take the bag upstairs. Understood? Now go. How come you came early? - I finished early. - You know, Fanny's here. She'll be staying with us for a few months. Oh yes! What are you doing? That is not a plastic bag. Clean your hands, or you'll stain it. Martha, Fanny, come downstairs... Lucas has a surprise, he arrived early! Lucas, in just one month you've grown taller than me. - But Mother, you always tell me that. - I love you. Look at him. My one and only. My dear nephew! - Hi, aunt Martha. - You remember Fanny right? - Hi Fanny. - Hi Lucas. You will keep her company. She's grown up, hasn't she? She wanted to go with her parents to America, but they're leaving her with us. You're going to make sure she enjoys her time here, right? I'll do, mother. I'll show you upstairs. We'll chat later, Lucas. Sure. When my mom went on a trip she said "You can go when you're older. " And you made up for the damage, right? Yes, and so will Fanny when she's our age. In the meantime, she stays here. I understand your disappointment But do you understand our reasons? You are too young for certain things. Don't you understand? Fanny! Her reaction is normal. Lucas, go try to comfort Fanny. Don't worry. They'll be fine... .. and they'll get along well together. In a week she'll have forgetten. With Lucas taking care of her time will pass quickly. It's good for him too. Youth with youth! - They sent you to comfort me? - Of course not. We haven't had a vacation in 10 years. So I thought, it's about time we had one. Enjoy, we are jealous to see you leave. One of these days we'll take a vacation too. Right honey? It's not too bad here either. With the sea so close, and all the rest. I have to say the seacoast here... is sensational. - Yes, it's sensational. - Didn't I say so? Simona. They're all still here, chatting away. Pfft. What a Sunday! What does it make you think of? Try this... and let me know. Well, have you finished your conversation? I just wanted her opinion of my dessert. C'mon on. Hurry up. I told you once before to ignore Gina, and I'd appreciate it if you would listen! This is the last time I'll repeat myself! You don't think I've noticed that you're trying to make her your slave? You're also very untidy! Go put on a clean apron! And remember. Leave Gina alone. What are you waiting for? Fine cuisine is out of fashion. It still exists... but it's rare. People don't know what fine cuisine is. They do at your place. - May I have more, please? Yes, of course. Thank you. - Excellent. - Glad to hear. - Aren't you exaggerating? - Leave him. In America he'll discover that our kitchen doesn't compare. Gina, get the kids. Yes, Miss. Everything's fantastic here. It's really boring here. Yes. There's no cinemas? Yes there are three of them, but- Mr. Lucas, they're all waiting for you at the table, to serve the cake. Okay. We're right behind you my little hazelnut chocolate. She's not bad, the black dollie, eh? Well then, have a nice trip. Goodbye and have a nice trip. Oh yes! I'm the one taking the trip. - See you soon. - We'll send postcards in colour! - Well... - Goodbye. Goodbye, have a nice trip. - No, no I'll take this one with me. - Here you go Madam. - Please, Madam. - Thank you. Goodbye Fanny, be good. - And this is for you, kids! - Thank you, Sir. Goodbye, you! - Goodbye, ladies and gentlemen. - Have a nice trip! - Goodbye. - Goodbye my darling. Don't be sad. - Bye. - Goodbye. Why aren't you two back in the kitchen? Hurry up, if you want to make it to the cinema. But don't come back later than 8:00. We'll eat at 9:00. Didn't look like they were too generous with the tip. - How much did they give you? - 10 Francs! With this, we'll go far... Rotten bastards! I would love to take a trip myself. What are you saying? With a villa like this, where could you want to go? I don't know, anywhere. Just for a change. Isn't change important sometimes? You are never satisfied. Ah! It's about time you two showed up. Prepare a cold dinner for us. We'll eat in the lounge. And hurry up. - Where are you going? - I'll be back shortly. Silence! Well, it's a nice Sunday. Those two fools! I hate starting something I can't finish. You can say that again. Nevertheless, we were off to a good start. Two hot guys with everything you need. Yes, but we would've been better off if we hadn't met them. In that case... Sunday is screwed! Or I wear the chastity belt? The convent! Too bad my guy was so good. And what about mine? Have you ever tried satisfying yourself? Not like that. I used to do it, when I was still a virgin. Well you see, it could be a way to get some release, now and then. Why don't you try? You have no partner? I'm scared. Scared of not finishing. It's silly. Of course not. We both need to make love. So, why not help each other out? I've never done it. I'd be embarrassed. No reason to be embarrassed. It is nice, although it's just a kind of substitution. What news is there? What? Oh, the news!... The stock market is down. And how are our investments doing? "L'Europeenne" was a good thing. Yeah! In some things you are very good... and in others not so much. Maybe you're tired? I am not tired! Good morning Miss Fanny. Did you sleep well? Good morning, Gina... Very well. Would you like some coffee? Thanks. Thank you. You're welcome! The dollie woke up with a bare ass. Bring coffee to young Lucas, too. That way he'll leave the room and we can finish earlier. Do you think he'll also have a bare ass? I'd like that... Good Morning Lucas. Thank you. May I serve you some coffee? - A little more, please. - Yes of course. - Is that good, young man? - Call me Mr. Lucas, won't you! I grew up, I'm not a baby. Can't you see that? - Sorry Sir. - Leave now. Go! Be careful! You're hurting me? Can't you see? - How's it going with Gina? - Very well, Madam. Luca's Mother: Try to help her. It's difficult to find help in a place as isolated as ours. Oh, yes of course Madam.. Tell me everything right away. Warn me immediately. I don't want to be the last one to find out about the shenanigans in this house. Agreed? - Yes, Madam. - Was that clear? - Good morning, Mother. - Hello, darling. The coffee was disgusting! Are you the one who made it? Yes, I am. It's not my fault if it's poor quality. Well, change it. It was undrinkable. Lucas is right. The coffee was bad. I'll speak to... I'll speak to Martha about it. Gina, I told you to wash your hands before serving the coffee. - Gina listen... - Yes Miss. I told you to change your apron when serving in the rooms. I did, Miss Martha. And I also washed my hands. I don't want to have to say it again. Morning! Splendid. - It's nice here. - Thank you. - The sun is not very strong. - Doesn't matter, it's enchanting here. I even think it's a bit brisk. Well... Where's Lucas? It seems he's disappeared. Why isn't he here with us? Leave him alone. He's on vacation. He does what he wants. He's sleeping too much. He should know that. Good answer. - Hello, girls. Aunt Good morning. The sun is good for our old bones. Did you sleep well? Have you seen Lucas? He said he'll be late. May I sit there. The boy becomes more and more sluggish. Leave the boy alone. He's here for recreation, isn't he? Look. Lucas is leaving. We could go out in the sun ourselves. It's about time! Hey, look! Fancy, isn't it? That's Fanny's underwear! Boy, oh, boy! Can't be his mother's. Do you think they slept together? Maybe. Under these conditions, maybe we too could get lucky. You mean to say that... It's true. I mean that Lucas's game might benefit us for once. We have to find out if the young master is experienced in sexual things. Otherwise we have to content ourselves to sapphic love till next Sunday. Would that be bad for you? I admit in sexual things you're great. Thank you, but that was only the beginning. - You think? - Yes. Okay, I'm in. Just do as I say. you'll experience a new world. - Really? - Yes, sure. Am I the one who has to serve? We're ready, Miss Martha. Look at this fool get excited over some bargain basement underwear. But when he gets a load of us, he won't need that anymore. - Is Lucas still asleep? - I believe so, Madam. I think we've been repeating ourselves for the past few days. Okay, go wake him up. Go. Yes, sir. Leave him alone! In our youth, we liked to sleep, too. Not always! Sometimes, yes! Lucas is like me. When I was young, I loved sleeping in. Your father sent me to wake you up. At his age, I was working. Lucas! Yes, dad? What are you doing? Are you coming down to have breakfast with us or not? Okay, I'm coming. Hurry up! - Hurry up! - You were right! He is your spitting image. And if you had given him a better education, he wouldn't be like this. That's for sure! - Will you come down? - Come on! I'm coming! I'll come if you want, but I'll need three minutes. Forget it or I'll cum on the table. Right away. I'm coming. Lucas! See you later, silly. Yeah, Dad. I'm coming, but what's the big hurry? Yeah, I'm coming! It's terrible! I can't believe this bullshit. And you have to pay for that. I don't believe this! Change the channel. Out of the question! I want to see how far they'll go! Lucas, be nice to Fanny. You've hardly spoken to her. Ah, Idiots! Idiots! If I had no manners, I'd say much worse! That's it for today. - Should we go back to Lucas? - Yeah. Do you think he can handle both of us, together? Of course. Why? "It" is always ready and up for it. I'll handle it tonight. It could've been yesterday, that I was standing here... ...watching your thighs, my dear Aunt Martha. My memory of you will always be connected with my first sexual arousal. My first sexual arousal came in response to you. I would say, even more, I considered you my first wife... ...and looked at your intimate parts. Your femininity satisfied my curiosity. Your swollen breasts and your pussy made my heart beat so fast... ...that I was afraid it would fail. Ah Lucas. It's you. I'm sorry. I'll just change quickly and then leave. I waited for you last night. We were delayed. I'm sorry. Lucas. We're going to town. Are you coming? Come on, get in! Check!... What's with you? You're acting so absent-minded. Yes, what's wrong Lucas? You're not only scattered, but in the last few days you've been sleeping all the time. Nothing's wrong! I came here to rest and the best way to do that is to sleep. And besides, you're not being very nice to Fanny. Why Miss? If he likes to sleep so much... You spend the morning in bed... The evening watching TV. Your father, at your age, knew how to use his time much better, believe me. Really! Gina, follow me to the attic, please. Yeah, I'm coming, just a second! Wait! One moment. Why didn't you come up to my room, both of you. Let's go to my room. No. I can't. What if we didn't show up tonight? He'd be quite upset. As for myself, I would love it. You would! Wouldn't you? Oh, sorry. Don't mention it. Somebody's coming. Seems so. Listen... Hey, Lucas! You are very beautiful. That suits you. Try it on... That slut! No shame! She's not even wearing panties. What do you say? Do you like it? - It must be one of Aunt Martha's dresses. - Try this one. She is pretty, you know. That's true, and it suits you. How does that look? In her youth, Martha must have been a very beautiful girl. Oh yes, she was beautiful. For me she was the only beautiful girl. I realized that one morning when she bathed me. When she touched me I got my first erection. That made her shy. She wasn't expecting that. The best part, was that I wasn't ashamed. On the contrary, I wanted to hug her, but I didn't do it, and my erection disappeared. She had me turn away from her. Dear Aunt Martha... that was the last time she bathed me. Why have you stopped talking? Hey, that's Martha! Yes, Aunt Martha... so beautiful with her blonde hair. One night we had guests. There was a heavy thunderstorm and they couldn't leave. To free up a room, Aunt Martha decided to share a bed with me. Sitting on the stairs I had overheard everything... ...and couldn't sleep at the thought of her hot body so close to mine. And also at the thought... that I could touch her naked body. I was afraid that I would fall asleep beforehand. All this talk that I heard, drove me crazy. And my mother kept on playing piano, although no one really listened. I took all my courage... .. and I got up and went to the sitting room. Lucas, it's late. A little boy needs to sleep now. Go to bed. Go to bed! Come on, go! Go to bed! Aunt Martha came to me... to convince me to go back to bed. I hoped she would stay with me... but she had to go back to the guests. She promised me she would return later, and she would come to my room. Go to bed! Do it for me! Go to bed! I wanted to cry over her shoulder... in her hair. But I resolved not to sleep before she came to me. I pretended to go to our room... .. but when she left, I came back and I sat on the stairs... ...as a lover who is waiting for his beloved. She didn't look too bad. Not bad, you say? She was beautiful, goose! You can't come close to her. I waited eagerly. I would have given anything to make them quit... .. so Aunt Martha, at last, could finally be with me. I was afraid that I would fall asleep and lose contact with her. Despite my best efforts, my eyes started to close. Finally I heard them saying "good night" and quickly went to bed. In bed... .. I closed my eyes to give Aunt Martha the impression that I was already asleep. I heard her steps approaching... ...and that sound kept pace with the beating of my heart. After making sure that I was asleep, she started to undress. I followed every of her movements. I closed my eyes pretending to be asleep. That way I could imagine her body and smell her fragrance. A fragrance of her very own... ...that I had smelled so often. When she was lying down beneath myself... ...the fragrance grew very intense. The same fragrance as on her underwear... ...on things she had thrown into the laundry basket. I didn't need to be afraid to fall asleep any more. I had waited for her to fall asleep... ...to enjoy her body... ...at close range. Martha's naked! Completely naked! And for me only! I'll never know if she realized that I looked at her. I couldn't care less. So I continued until I happily fell asleep. When she woke up the next morning she must've found me in the same position. She got up but let me continue to sleep. When I woke up she was gone... ...but I still felt the warmth of her body. From that time on, I had the feeling that she was mine. And I became jealous. My parents threw a party. The family was all there... ...and a number of strangers. A toast, applause, and somebody asked my father to give a speech. I can't remember a word of what he was saying. The people around me didn't exist. I only thought about Aunt Martha... No, I only thought about Aunt Martha's body... I still had the pictures of last night before my eyes I had them embedded in my memory, forever... Suddenly I realized that the man sitting next to me... ...brazenly flirted with Martha. All the people were talking. They blabbed and blabbed. What was so important to talk about? Since two hours only confusion of voices. And Martha smiling at an old guy who whispered in her ear. Her smile as answer to his dirty jokes... ...was like a stab in the back. And then I realized... ...that he was not only whispering in her ear... It was like I had imagined. That pig didn't limit himself to talking! He fumbled between aunt Martha's thighs! I was dying of jealousy... Did you hurt yourself? Nobody understood what happened... ...except Aunt Martha who caught my eye... ...or maybe she had been awake and complicit the night before. Lucas! Please wait! I beg you... I'll come down. Please stay there. Lucas, tell me what happened. Tell me what happened. Lucas, you can always talk to me. You don't need to say anything, I already know everything, Lucas. I never thought that she could do such a thing! Was porn already in fashion back then? That's enough! Come along. Calm down! What is wrong with you? Let's see what that was all about. What have you found? A beautiful picture... It might come in handy. A great woman, aunt Martha! Why don't you want to see me anymore? Hands off! It's over! Simona! Put that down, and go home immediately. The political situation is incredible! Amazing that no one realizes that the parties are disastrous. That the democracy is killed by the particracy. Particracy, democracy - The programs are prepared day by day, which is perverse. - You will see the consequences. - I am going to bed. Good night. What's wrong with him? He's part of this world too. Unbelievable! - Parents, politics, romantic couples! - That's how it is now. I never said he was an exception. There you are finally. - Everybody else is sleeping? - Yes. He's eager to learn how to make love. Yes. But you're not the only one who's eager to learn. Right, Gina? Do I tell him who it is? You know her. It's little Fanny, the beautiful Fanny. Yes... A little young, but beautiful and almost ripe. That is crazy! I don't think so. I see that our friend here is visibly... a little doubtful. - Maybe she won't be fire and flame. - You're both crazy! I don't think so. Ripe or not, you see? I'm sure it will be a big surprise. Let her read a little more in the book. - Maybe she surprises us all. What book? A pornographic book of your father. And every evening, she makes herself happy... What do you want? What are you doing here? I'm sorry to disturb you. All I wanted... ...was to bring the book back to it's place. For what reason? It belongs to me. - It's not ready yet. - How do you know? We've programmed everything. - I want now... - Please wait! You may spoil everything with impatience. Give Gina enough time to get the stone rolling. From time to time I also like such books. And they have a certain effect on me. And on you too, as I can see. But I don't care about love without partner. Love is too great a happiness not to be shared. Love cannot be performed alone. Only then is it unimaginably exciting. You're not mad with me? I didn't come here to disturb your pleasure, quite opposite! Want to read the book together? No! You mustn't be ashamed! Releax! We can do it without the book. It's unnecessary because we're two already. I don't want to! Don't touch me! No, please. I don't want that. - No please. - Why not? You'll like it. You shall be happy like never before. That's enough for a first time. Mission accomplished! - So, what happened? - First she was a bit reluctant. Then she catched fire... ...but she's still a virgin. Well done. You get Lucas as reward, You shall experience how good he is. He's all yours. - You'll be very nice... - But I... What are you talking about? Nothing, nothing. A surprise. I'm feeling like a third wheel here. It's time to switch to more promising things, immediately. And now that we're here, come on and go ahead. Hurry, hurry. Get up and dressed! Open the window and take a shower! This room smells like a whole regiment had sex. Good morning! Did you sleep well, Signorina Fanny? Yes, thank you. Do you want your coffee now? Yes, please. Do you have a guilty conscience? Don't worry! It was all my fault. But you liked it, didn't you? Tell me, please. Admit it! Tell me! Yes! Again? Why? The laundry is from Lucas. His bed sheets are full of stains. I saw you come last night. What is it Lucas? Oh nothing. I was just asking her if she felt like going out. Gina came to find me after your little adventure. Her pussy was still very wet! Don't you want to go out? No! I don't feel well today, excuse me. - Lucas, you should go keep her company. - Okay. Oh Fanny! - Stop. Don't touch me! - Come along... No! - Leave me alone! Fanny, open the door. I don't want to see you anymore! You're disgusting. Go away! Fanny! I'm afraid of you! Don't be so childish. Open up! - No! Fanny! This is not funny! I arranged everything so all of us could have some fun... I thought it was going well... Yes, I agree, but just like that they'll catch us. You'll see, it will end badly, and then what will we do? I'm hoping it will not end in a scandal. Hey! Lucas! No Lucas. That is not right and not appropriate. I am your aunt. Get it out of your mind. I can't do that. You're no longer a child. You are grown up now. Yes. Then we can make love! Don't say anything... Please. Okay, if we can't make love, let's take a boat trip. You will see how I've grown up. And don't say you're my aunt! In the chest in the attic I found a lot of things... ...you're not the real sister of my father because you've been adopted by my grandparents. Maybe that's what made me feel no regrets when I craved for your body. Quiet, Lucas. Please don't continue... Maybe one day, everything changes... Martha... or rather, Aunt Martha. I'll keep calling you that, like when I was a little child... Maybe I'll desire her even more... The thought of forbidden fruit, will increase our enjoyment... I know that she'll be mine. Because I want it to, and so does she. And we know, when it will happen... Well, he is not here. I think he went to bang the little one. It's possible. Let's go see. - Where's Lucas? - I don't know. What do you want? - I asked you where Lucas is. - Why are you asking me? Has he been here? No, why should he? Don't try to lie to us, lovely. You know where Lucas is! No. I have no idea. - Please, I don't know! Then we have to enjoy ourselves... Your attention, kids! We will now take the photo of the century. Immortalize this moment with a masterpiece. A family portrait in the Great Outdoors.
