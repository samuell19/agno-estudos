[gentle music] [birds caw] [wind rustles] [glass shatters] [tires squeal] [inaudible] [sobs] [helicopter whirring] WOMAN: Come on here. [dog pants] Hi. Hi. Come on. You gonna help me? Where do you want to go? Can we just drive? Well, um, I have to go to work. We're all magnet. We're just magnets put next to each other. You know, when magnets repel when they're too close... that's what they do. It doesn't change their purpose, when you put them close together, but sometimes it's too much, so they cancel each other out. So are they canceled out? Do you work? - Down there. - Do you know? [siren wails] No. Can you help me? What do you want? I don't... do you want some money? OK. [dog barking] Thanks, man. [chuckles] What are you laughing about? To "man"... I haven't heard anybody use "man" in a while. Do you tell people what it is, what's inside? Us Labradors... purer than white. That's their property. You know, there's also boundaries. That's part of it. It's not just the magnetic field. It's the initial response to the magnetic field. It makes us build up these fences, these fences... it's the way that we built everything... to protect ourselves. So we're just looking at each other across these acceptable distances. And we drew the lines. We separated out. That's not our purpose. We're at odds. We're at odds, right? So there isn't any real help. There's... there really isn't any real help. Are you afraid of me? Yes, you are. I know. If you have to go, I know. It's nice to meet you. Thanks for the money. Sure. Would you... would you... would you hold me? Thanks. Are you an angel? No. I wanted to... well, I'll tell you some other time. OK. Beyond love, there is no belief. There's no belief beyond love. WOMAN: Michael! It's time for breakfast. Come on in. [solemn music] [engine starts] [bird chirps] Thank you. What's the matter? Nothing. What? It's nothing. I'll tell you later. Oh. I'm sorry. I forgot the meeting. - That's all right. I'm getting used to it. Are you interested in prosecuting the Williams case? Is that the repeat rapist? Right. And this time, he's charged with assault and battery. Not really. Is there anything I can do to interest you in it? - Why? - Why? Yeah. What about Saunders? Aren't his numbers the best here? He's always had the most number of convictions. His sentencing figures have never been very good. Anyway, neither of them are where yours were. Morning, Katie. What happened with Valdez? I don't know yet. Has it been decided yet? I... I don't know yet That's all. I don't know yet. [phone rings] Same story, huh? Close the door, Will. What did you find out so far about where she lives, the girlfriend number one? Had a... is it still in New York? WILL: Don't know yet. Christmas week... calendar this for that week. I'm on it. [gentle music] You do know that only four courts have even addressed the admissibility of this kind of evidence during a prosecution in this context? OK. [sighs] How are you going to get the defendant's prior conduct in with the other woman? We can get it in under common scheme, or plan, or habit. What's going to be the charge? Involuntary manslaughter... there was gross indifference to the value of Diana's life. Diana is the third woman he's done this to. Debra, the second, is in a wheelchair. Oh, boy. I guess it would be a precedent setting case. But would this be the case to set that precedent? That I am not so sure. Never figured you for a feminist, KD. Everybody's got there woes, Steve. [chuckles] Yeah. That's true. We're going to miss you inside a court. You wanna give me that? All right. You still want to do this? I don't know. Did you know Diana? Did you ever meet her? No. No? Never talked to her? No. She ran right at it? Yeah. He was driving 40 miles an hour. [knocking] Yeah? This is what they had on the girlfriend. Went down to three years ago. Did they question her? They tried to. It's in there. OK. I want you to label everything about her. Girlfriend number one, label Debra, girlfriend two, and Diana three. All right. We're going to speak alone for a minute. How are you doing? I'm not doing. I see you! I see you! Hey! [inaudible] Hey! [smacks lips] Henry, hi. Hi, Henry. Hi, yes! Hi. [dog barking] It's me. Dad, he doesn't even know me. Hey. Let me see you. You're so good! LEO: You gonna ride back there? You care? LEO: No, of course not. Oh! Hey, buddy. [chuckles] It's great to have you home, sweetheart. Thanks, Dad. (SINGING) Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song. Are you still a dreamer, Dad? I don't know if I'm a dreamer, but I'm beautiful. [laughs] Can you tell me what's wrong with being that way? HEDDA: Nothing. It's just another world back then. LEO: Yeah. [gentle music] (SINGING) Starlight and dewdrops are awaiting... Our big lake... that's what Mom always used to call it. Still does. You know, Mom was upset she couldn't be here when you got home. And I'm sorry about the [inaudible].. Once a year. I'm glad I got to see you at all, Daddy. Thank you. - Bye, sweet toot. - I'll see you later. OK. Hey! What are you doing here? [laughs] I decided I could take the afternoon off and see my little sis. I guess you don't get in trouble for that kind of stuff anymore. - No, not anymore. 'Cause you're Miss Bossy. [laughs] Oh, you look so great. Hey, there you are! Hey! I just realized that I am incredibly hungry. I could get [inaudible]. Isn't she cute? Look at Willa! She's so big. KATE: I know! Oh! You don't say hello to me anymore? I missed you. - I can't believe this. We've got to go. We've got show and tell. She's taking Willa... MAN: Excuse me are you Hedda Amerson? Yes. MAN: You've been served, ma'am, by the state of California. BRETT: What is it, Hed? MAN: You're in possession of a subpoena. Come here. Let me see it. MAN: Sorry. Can I take a look at it? Wait a minute. Come here. You can light that in my oven. I'm gonna get you! I got you this time. I got you this time. [hums] - OK. HEDDA: I missed you too. All right, girls. I've got to go. I've got to get my golden-haired babies out of here. I have to go. I'm late. I'm late, Will. OK. Look both ways. Will you come see me later? [squeals] OK. Honey, watch your head. HEDDA: I'll come see you guys later, OK? What is this thing? When do you have to do this? I don't know. I didn't read that part. Fingers. BRETT: Tomorrow. Tomorrow? I'll see you later, OK? We'll play later. Whoo! WILLA: After... after show and tell. After show and tell... OK. Please, seat belts. Hey, pirate. Bye. Hey. I love you. Thanks. Thanks. Bye. [engine starts] BOY: Look out. [garage door opens] Mom? Where are you going? ELENORE: Hi. BRETT: Hi. [chuckles] What are you doing out here all alone? Mom. Hi. Oh, she's here. She's here in the dead of winter, my wondering one. I know. It's so warm here. It's great. Why aren't you out of those clothes? - I just got here. - You got to see Dad? Mm. He met me at the gate. Of course. Good to hear he met you at the gate. What are you thinking about? Nothing. That's a pretty ring. Yeah. Wow. It's a new guard around my wedding ring. You're the first of the girls to notice. It's great. Why don't you think about swimming while you're here? Wouldn't hurt to do a few laps, would it? No. How does it feel now, huh? Do you feel it? I can't remember the last time I asked you what you were thinking that you answered with anything but "nothing." The last time you could hear the answer. Mom, come on. I'm just kidding. I know to what extent you're kidding. You know, you probably won't be around that much before I'm gone for good anyway. So you don't have to worry about my bothering you. You never leave me, Mom. Don't be so sure about that. [phone ringing] Do you feel how close it is? Huh? Do you want to get closer now, huh? Did you find it? [water splashing] [children yelling] [solemn music] [engine rumbles] [door slams] [wind chimes ring] Gonna take a walk in the old neighborhood? I was thinking about it. You know, I think I could count on one hand the times I've seen you with your shoes on in your whole life. Guess I'd better say goodbye. OK. Gotta go home and feed the kid. Oh, I've got something for Renee's birthday I've got to give you. Is it a leotard? For her collection? Yes. She loves to dance just like you used to... - Brett. - Yeah? Your office called. They said something. BRETT: Yeah. When she got here. So are you able to verify that? All right. All right. So he'll be coming here to talk to her? Yeah. Thanks, Jerry, for getting on it so quickly. OK. Bye. They might have called your work to check if you were going to come in for Christmas, but they didn't ring in. If you need anything, I'm here. Just call. I don't have to speak to this guy, legally, do I, this lawyer? No. It's going to be harder on you if you don't, but you're not legally bound. It's going to happen sometime, Hedda. It was right for it to happen sometime. I've always thought that this happening would help you get away from it. You think you're finally going to get him, don't you, Brett? I love you. I love you, Hedda. I don't give a shit about him. All I care about is you and keeping you away from him. I haven't thought about any of this for years. BRETT: But that doesn't mean you're over it. Do you think you're over it? Are you over your arm? Are you over your leg? He's my arm. He's my leg. I don't want to be over my arm. I don't want to be over my leg. What are we to you? The family? The family. What's going on here? The family? Just the family? I can't even believe I care when you haven't given a shit about any of us in years. I'm going home to feed my kid. Will someone tell me what's going on? We asked you to stay, Brett. You see a sister of yours come to your apartment in the middle of the night at 16 years of age, Hedda, you come the way that you used to come to me, I dare you to feel any differently. And now, you are going to let him keep you from ever coming home again. It's exactly the same. It is the same it has always been with him. It's exactly the same. What do you mean? What do mean she came to your apartment? I can't believe we're doing this again. If anything happens to her tonight, I am holding you personally responsible. That's great, Ma. You're a mother and you're making it worse. Thanks. [sobs] [music - joni mitchell, "river"] Great. Mom. JONI MITCHELL: (SINGING) It's coming on Christmas. They're cutting down trees. They're putting up reindeer and singing songs of joy and peace. Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on. But it don't snow here. It stays pretty green. I'm going to make a lot of money. Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene. I wish I had a river I could skate away on. I wish I had a river so long. I would teach my feet to fly. Whoa. I wish I had a river I could skate away on. [crickets chirping] [dog barking] We gave at the office. We want more. We don't have any more to give. Sure you did. [chuckles] She's my sister. Your sister? My sister. And she's not here. [sighs] Do you know when she'll be back? BRETT: She's not going to talk to you. You don't know where she is? Where she might be? She used to go to the pool. Which pool? Did anyone know you were her sister when this first came up four years ago? - I don't know. - How is it at, um... Littleton and Gates. [kd laughs] It's pretty good. I got a kid. It's still a shame not seeing you in court. [wind rustles] [gentle music] Hedda Amerson? You're him? I think so. I'm going swimming. [solemn music] Do you have a second hand? [pants] I didn't know how good this is by your standards. I don't know what it means. It didn't matter. Here you go, in case you get cold. I wish he could love me enough, maybe even once, not to call me in. I wish anybody could love anyone that much, just do for that person what they need. When you go today... I won't be there today. You won't. When you do something you can't do, you're not there. That's how you do it. A case like this, a trial or whatever, will never matter. I won't help anyone. Why? Getting somebody for something they couldn't help doing in the first place, it just... it doesn't help anything, stop anyone. Could I have a ride home, please? Sure. My car's over there. [solemn music] What happened at the Olympic trials? I lost. I know. But I saw them pull you out of the pool on TV. Thank you. I ripped a muscle in my back. I'm sorry. No. It was my fault. I just... I kept pulling too hard on my right side for years and I never bothered to fix my stroke. Maybe I'll fix it now. I was trying to tonight, anyway... first time back in. Hey, you. What are you doing awake? Aw. KATE: Oh, there's my baby. Do you want me to hold her? - I got her. What are you guys doing here? You on your way to school? No. Nicky woke up this morning. She got some rash or something on her forehead. I want Dad to look at it. I can't believe Mom still has that picture up. I just... she has red dots or, I don't know... and I'm thinking maybe she's allergic to something new. Oh, goody goody. Did you guys stay here? Yeah. We had power out. Sorry I didn't call, Mom. Shh. ELENORE: Hedda, I'm not going today if you don't mind. HEDDA: Whatever you want, Mom. I don't think I can. HEDDA: OK. El. It's time to leave, sweetheart. I don't think they'll call her till this afternoon. They said 8:00. So what, are we going to take one car? Is that it? Yeah, I guess so. What, do you want to save the gas? Well, whatever you girls think is best. Yeah. Let's... let's save that gas. Yeah. Come on. Dad. I don't want you to go. I don't think... It's whatever you want, sweetheart. Your mom didn't tell me everything. But it wouldn't change how I feel about you. Yeah, I know. I just still don't want you to go. OK. [birds chirping] MAN: Hedda Amerson, they're ready for you. BRETT: I got you, babe. Just go right down front. And place your left hand on the Bible and raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Uh, you need to say "I will" or "I do" for the record. I will. JUDGE: Thank you. You may be seated. Counselor. Yes, Your Honor. Good afternoon, Miss Amerson. Sorry for the delay. All right. Let me get myself... Miss Amerson, there are incidents that took place during the time that you were seeing the defendant that, uh... that I'm going to be asking you questions about. OK. Do you remember Mr. Gregory Wilton? Yes. You testified that on the night of August 12th, 1985, you were arguing with the defendant out in front of your house on Fisk Street. I ran into a station wagon. KD: Did your running at the car have anything to do with the argument? It was because of the argument, because of me, everything. Could you tell us what was running through your mind when you ran across the street? I was very emotional, immature, when I was young. The other voice in my head was just saying, it will always be this way. It'll never stop. Just run. There was a voice that told you to run? When does the voice speak to you? When? Every day? Every other Thursday? It speaks to me when I'm facing reality. It speaks to me about who I really am. Are those also the type of conversations you would have with the defendant? HEDDA: What do you mean? Did the conversations ever make you want to hurt yourself? No. You said the voice was saying, it will always be this way. It will never change. What will always be this way? What wouldn't change? Certain patterns. Objection. Their relationship isn't on trial here. Now, surely he can't be allowed to go into the whole of their past... Your Honor, if you'll allow me to continue with this line of questioning, it will be clear that the defendant has a habit of disabling women, which he habitually and automatically returns to. I want to see where this is going. But see that it goes somewhere quickly. How would you describe your relationship with the defendant? I wouldn't. Did he ever strike you? No. No? That... that isn't what happened. You were never admitted at the emergency hospital for... HEDDA: Strike still wouldn't be the right word. Strike is a courtroom word. It sounds like you're talking about somebody you don't know. It sounds premeditated. Well, what would be the word that you would use for what happened instead? He hit me. Were you ever afraid for your life? No. If you could just tell the court, why not? Because I knew... I knew, then, that it wouldn't go beyond a certain point. Fuck! If that answers your question. Yes. And no. What does "then" mean? Sorry? Does "then" mean at some point, when the thought occurred to you, that he didn't have it in him to go further? If you could just give us an instance so we could understand why you believe that you think the defendant is incapable of... He had a pillow over my head. But you could still breathe? Yes. He was letting you breathe. I thought I already answered the question. OK. Do you remember December 11th, 1988? Some of it. I was unconscious for all of it. KD: Why were you in the hospital? What were you being treated for? My head. I, um... a fall... I fell from my window. What... what does that got to do with anything? Do you remember jumping from your window on the night of December 11th, 1988? No. No? No, I didn't jump. KD: You didn't jump? No. I stepped. Was your purpose the same as on August 12th, 1985 when you ran at the car? HEDDA: No, it wasn't the same. It wasn't your purpose to harm yourself? No. KD: What was your intention? To stop not sleeping. I hadn't slept, and I didn't know if I was going to be able to sleep again on any basis. Did your not sleeping have anything to do with the defendant? I hadn't seen him in years. I wasn't even thinking about him. KD: You didn't see him that night? HEDDA: No. I'd like to call the court's attention to People's exhibit number two entered into evidence in yesterday's testimony, the sign-in sheet at the emergency room of the Broadway Hospital. Would you like to see this? I believe you, but I didn't talk to him and I didn't see him. My mother told me he was there. Objection. Your Honor, the event obviously has no bearing on this case. Any further questions on it would only serve to satisfy the curiosity of Mr. Dietrickson, but certainly wouldn't fulfill any needs of this court. If she is testifying that nowhere in her mind did she intent to harm herself in stepping from the window, then I think it is probable she was not in her right mind at the time. Her state of mind is the essence of the case and assessing whether that state had anything to do with him. Counselors, let's get back to the question at hand. I've agreed to allow this. So let's just go on with it. If I'm wrong, you're on the record for the appeal. Would you tell us, in your own words, exactly what brought you to the window? I don't know what this has to do with anything. KD: Take your time if you need to. My other voice was just saying just stop it, just step into it. KD: Stop what? The not sleeping. Step into what? The dark. How much, uh, sleep had you lost? On the whole, I didn't sleep. How many hours a week do you think you were getting? Probably seven to eight, maybe less. How long did this go on for? Um, well, it started just before Halloween. So what, October, November, six weeks roughly? No, I meant the year before I... Are you saying it was a year and six weeks? Eight hours a week? Sometimes I got a couple hours more. KD: Why couldn't you sleep? Had something happened? I was afraid of the dark. That's why I didn't want to go to sleep in it. I saw it moving. Why? Why was nothing as you thought it was? Was a table a table? Was it because nothing was necessarily as it had been before? Had something happened to make you believe that nothing was as you thought it was? There was something that you felt, believed utterly, to the point where when you learned that it wasn't so... a table wasn't a table and the dark wasn't that dark. What was it that you used to believe in? What was it that you believed in more than God? That he loved me. But what exactly brought you to that point where you know he didn't love you? Did you get a phone call that year from his sister, Rita, just prior to the period in which you couldn't sleep? Rita? Yeah, I talked to her once. What did she say? What did she tell you? Rita. That he had... that Debra had a broken leg. So you didn't feel that he didn't love you anymore until you heard about the leg. Somewhere in your mind, did you equate the degree of love with the degree of violence? What did you feel when you heard about the leg? Envy. I know you want to walk, Hed. [solemn music] Mom? I will in a minute. Would you like me to leave? I was always going to tell you, Hedda, but I just... it never seemed like the right time. I found you myself. I took you to the hospital myself. Mom. And then I signed his name on the sign-in sheet and then I left. I didn't call an ambulance because I thought it would take too long. And I thought I could keep any record of it off any transcript, uh, just to keep it quiet. Mom. You came and sat in the corner of my room so many times in the middle of the night. You were so afraid. I ended up sleeping with you just so that you... I know. OK. I know. ELENORE: And then sometimes... HEDDA: Mom. Sometimes the way you would touch me in your sleep, I knew... I knew you thought it was him. And I just... I just let her believe it, that it was him, because I thought that's why she slept longer. And you did seem to sleep longer. And then that night at the hospital, well, I thought if you thought that he was there... Mom, you can't be the person... Oh, you know so well, mother of a 10-year-old. You do with your daughter what you think is best. I did with mine. Mom, it's all right. It's all right. I knew. I'm not a liar. I know you're not a liar. All right. All right. Where's Kate? Not back from picking up the kids yet. So that's what happened. I'll get that, Hedda. I'd do it again. HEDDA: You got any cookies, Mom? ELENORE: No. No cookies in the house. You know that. Oh my god. Hey, you. Will you come back out? Yeah. [birds chirping] [dog barking] So do you love me enough yet? [scoffs] I still say you're a good man. Is everyone good? Born? Yes. Brett says that you don't know how to see another person as an enemy. She says you don't know the word "enemy." Is that what she wants me to know? Sometimes I think she'd want to believe that you could protect yourself. Sad. [solemn music] [crickets chirping] Hed, honey, uh, are you going to be sleeping here tonight? I was going to. Yeah. Oh, OK. Yeah. Um, gee. Just I told Nicky that... well, I promised Nicky she could sleep with all the stuffed animals and I just... Well, do you need it for her? No, no, no it's not... no, no. I can sleep on the couch. No, no, no. - I can sleep... - Would you, please? - Yeah. - Please? Good. That would be great. Nicky! Hey, Nick. Where's Pluto? OK. Let's get into bed. [gentle music] Kate still doesn't have any power? [laughs] I don't think she even checked. It's just an excuse so she can be closer to Mama. [laughs] Do you want me to pick you up for court tomorrow? When did you tell him that I didn't know what the word "enemy" is? What? Before you got here today. As I was walking him from the front door down the hallway to the kitchen, I think we exchanged about three sentences. Renee! Renee! Come on, pal, let's go. But you promised me that I could stay, help Grandma make pies for tomorrow. You look so much like your dad. Do you know that? Listen, I need to talk to Hedda on my own. So I'll decide in a minute. - I can stay. - No, you can't. RENEE: Mom. Up, Renee. Would you like me to stay out of it, not come tomorrow? Maybe. All right. Maybe I should be kept out of it from now on. That means the next time you're contacted in New York or the next time you have to testify, if this goes to trial, I'll not be asked for my advice. And that means I'm not the one you go to when you want to ask, what happens if I leave? It means I think you should find a lawyer without my recommendation when you need one. Maybe then we can go back to being sisters. I can't believe that you brought up Pluto. Why would you do? You know, it's not just an ordinary stuffed animal. He was her world, Hedda. You know that. Kate, we're talking. I'm sorry I didn't mean to. Well, it's just... uh, yeah. It's just kids, I guess. You'll know what I'm talking about when you have them. Yeah. I guess so. BRETT: Jesus. Come on. Let's go. [solemn music] [water splashes] [birds chirping] Doesn't look like this is going to go to trial, does it? Hi. This is Will. [inaudible] Yeah, I know. Hi. Can I come in? Sure. Um, they're going to have to call you up again anyway. Oh. Am I the first one in today? Yeah. Great. So this is where you live. [laughs] Pretty much. I really have to have to go to the bathroom. Can you just please just not let them start without me? OK? I'll go. And I just don't want to miss even the beginning part, not at all, OK? Mom. Mom. Yesterday you talked about the voice that told you to run at the car, and you said that it was the same voice that told you to just step out the window. When, um... yesterday, you said that you felt envy for Debra when you heard of the broken leg. Do you remember what you felt about yourself? I don't know that I thought about myself. What was running through your mind when you heard about the leg? She's worth more than me. I wasn't worth hitting. Did you feel that you wanted to be worth hitting? Worth hitting? No. I wanted to be the one who was hit. It's different. Why? Because then I'd know I was loved. Were you 16 when you met him? Yes. [chuckles] Was that your only experience with romantic love as you were learning about love? Had you lost... had you stopped seeing your friends? I'd stopped seeing my family because I wanted to be with him every minute. Some of my attachments weren't good, things about that had nothing to do with love, just about myself, my ego and how I looked. I just wanted to be with one other person. So the attachments were removed to anything outside him. You were alone with him a lot. As you have testified, you were talking about things. Yes. And then, as you have testified, when you were asked whether he would talk to you first about these kinds of things, you said you would talk to me about these kinds of things that I hadn't paid attention to yet, but I would agree with him when it was pointed out to me, and then, as you have testified, sometimes it ended up that he would... and you verified this... hit you. Objection. Sustained. - Did he make you feel... - Objection. Sustained. I'll rephrase. Did you feel relief when he hit you? Sometimes. Did you feel relief because you felt you were a bad person and there was a pattern in your relationship where, when he'd hit you, you felt better? Loved? I can tell you what I felt. I felt he was trying to get through to me. And that's what I meant when I said I understood why he hit me, as I knew he was trying to get past my skin to me, inside where I was. He wanted to be face to face with me. Sorry. [sobs] When someone gets you to see exactly how they feel, when they give you everything of themselves, the sadness and the other side of them instead of just what they've divided out of themselves, the prettier part, they've given everything to you. And the experience of that is it makes you... you haven't been left out of anything, and they've made you part of everything in them. When you were alone with him, um... was his the only other voice that you were hearing? As you had previously stated, wasn't this during the time when you were becoming convinced that you were a bad person? Can't the court assume, then, that he was the one who taught you you were a bad person? My mother taught me that too, not on purpose, but she did, and a coach I had once, the Catholic church... he did. I did. There were things that I have done that weren't good. And I didn't meet you when I was 16. I met him. And how do you know it wouldn't have been better? How do you know if I didn't love him more, this wouldn't have happened, his rage? That kind of love doesn't cure rage. Counselor. It isn't love. That's not love. Your Honor, may I approach? He made you feel that it was, and you can't even see it. JUDGE: Ms. Gill. You don't love! You don't love. JUDGE: Ms. Gill. Ms. Gill, that's it. Did you walk... did you walk... did you walk here? Have you been walking for the last six years? Yes. I'm going to have to ask you to leave. DEBRA: I'm OK. In the interest of time, we are moving on. Do you have a closing question, Counselor? Um. Did the defendant... was the defendant capable of taking hold of your mind to the extent that you could not think your own thoughts, that... that only his were there? Yes, but he didn't have hold of it that night. Is that it? What's it like to get hit all the time? - Objection. - Sustained. You don't have to answer that question, Ms. Amerson. [gentle music] Does the defense have any questions at this time? Yes, Your Honor, just, uh... just a couple. Ms. Amerson. Was the defendant there the night you stepped from the window? Was he in the room with you? No, not in the room. ATTORNEY: Ms. Amerson, if you had a choice to live your life over again exactly as it was, exactly as you have told it to us here, would you change any of it, I mean, even one moment of it? No. So you take sole responsibility for stepping from the window and running at the car? I have to. Thank you. That's all, Your Honor. All right. You may step down now, Ms. Amerson. Glenn, would you, uh, give the witness a hand? Thank you. I'm going to walk around just in these couple of blocks, OK? I'll be back. OK. All right. I'll come pick you up. I just hate to see you so demoralized. [siren wails] [solemn music] [seagulls cawing] You want to walk? I don't want to go home right now. You wanna go to the beach? Been there. Talk about jaded. Been to the mountains? Mm hmm. Do you love anyone? No. Everybody, but no one in the specific. No one? My son. My mom. You can't love anybody else? I don't. When was a table not a table? [sighs] [groans] A couple years ago. Were you able to work? Not really. People know? No. I was on one case for a long time. So... What was it that was your fault? It has to do with my wife, Ian's mom. Will the dark move again, if you let yourself look at it, or a table not be a table? Yes, I think so. But you don't let yourself? No. No. You going in? I think I want to sleep. That OK? KD: OK. Where have you been? KD: No place. [dog barking] MAN: You did a great job. CHILD: I got it. [chattering] [gentle classical music] How you doing? Can I see him? Yeah, I think so. I'll go call. I can get a cab or have my sister take me if you want. KD: No, no, it's fine. I'd have to take you anyway. [solemn music] I'm gonna be upstairs. How you doing? HEDDA: OK. How you doing? I'm all right. I tried to call you a couple years ago. I know. My mom told me. I'm sorry you had to go through this. HEDDA: Yeah. Are you in jail? No. I didn't know that you felt that way about a lot of things, about things you'd done. You don't know. You have to do something like that. I know. It's different. The reason I called you when I did was to say I was sorry. [chuckles] What's so funny? It's just funny... the word. It's not even long. It's just funny, one word for years at a time, you know? How's your mom? The same. And your dad? HEDDA: Dad's good. Still go to church? [laughs] Every Sunday. Do you still go? No. It sounds like you still believe what they taught us. Probably. GREGORY: That's too bad. Why? Because of what they told us about God. What is God to you? HEDDA: What do you mean? Is he like us? No, he's not us, if that's what you mean. So he's without our needs. HEDDA: Uh huh. Is he complete, then? HEDDA: Yes. Why does he need you to be anything for him? I think your God should be at least as complete as you are, as forgiving. [solemn music] How are you now? I'm better. I don't let myself get attached anymore the way I did with you. I can't make life that important again. It's ironic. I was so much better, and then this happened. I'm still both. But I was better. What about your daughter? You're not attached to her? I don't know. I've enjoyed observing her get older. HEDDA: You're not attached to her? I can't afford to be. Thank you for coming to see me. You know, there was something I wanted to ask you about when we were young. Do you want to ask me something? [siren wails] No. It doesn't matter. [MUSIC - KANSAS CITY CHORALE, "SILENT NIGHT"] KANSAS CITY CHORALE: (SINGING) Silent night, Holy night. I'm gonna go. KANSAS CITY CHORALE: (SINGING) All is calm. All is bright. Round yon virgin mother and child. Holy infant so tender and mild, sleep in heavenly peace. Silent night, Holy night. [laughs] HEDDA: Simon says put your... Dad, do you want to have a drink? 'Cause I'll get you one. No, thanks. No. Leo, would you like to know what was said in court? [gasps] Christmas angels! [inaudible] Yes, one present. One present, OK? You're going to the airport tomorrow. - Yeah. - I want to take you. I'm going to take you. - Great. - What time do you leave? - 10:30. 10:30. Good. - Great. - OK, great. Oh, Hed. No, I can't do it. I can't do it. It's OK. I'll ask Dad. - OK. I'll ask Dad. All right. Bye bye. Bye. Bye. OK. We gotta go. One present, one present. That's good. [MUSIC - LITTLE MISSENDEN SCHOOL, "AWAY IN A MANGER"] [dog barking] Ian, come here. Dad. Merry Christmas. [sighs] Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. LITTLE MISSENDEN SCHOOL: (SINGING) In your tender care... and fit us for heaven, to live with you there. [gentle music] Hi. Hi, Mom. I thought you'd like to take this with you. [laughs] Wow. Thanks. We're leaving. I'll see you tomorrow, sweetie. OK. Um, Mom, can we go? Yeah. Just a minute, just... RENEE: OK. I'm gonna open one present tonight. Hey, hey. [laughs] Remember how Mom and Dad would never let us do that? And everybody else got to. Is Dad driving you tomorrow? Mm. Is that why the ticket was half, leaving on Christmas? No one flies on Christmas morning. You do. Mom, let's go. Did you thank Grandma and Grandpa? - No. - Go on. Go on. I love you more. I know I'm not supposed to. I'm supposed to love everybody in the family the same, but I don't. You're so beautiful. Don't let anybody take that away. RENEE: Come on, Mom. Let's go. Say goodbye to your aunt. - Bye. - Bye. Bye, sweetie. I'm goin'. Bye. Bye. [sobs] Hi. Hi. [chuckles] [sighs] What you been doing? I've been thinking about if you were all right, a lot. - I'm always all right. - Yeah. I know. So... huh? I wanted to say goodbye. Goodbye? Yeah. And thank you for being nice. That was hard. Am I ever gonna see you again? No. But I'll think of you all the time. As what? [chuckles] As my lawyer and guardian angel... that's supposed to be savior and guardian... as my savior and guardian angel. But not as a person? you can't think of me as a person? No, not as a person. I have to stay attached right now. I have to build up my resistance like everybody else. You're not everybody else. You want a piece of pie? [gentle music] [dog barking] You don't like it? No. Well, at least you're fair. Ian's mom? Yeah. You know, I realized I called her my wife to you before, but, uh, Ian's mom is who she is. So what'd you lose your belief in? Saw a table wasn't a table? Me. And now you love everybody, but nobody in particular... your son, your mom. Will you be disappointed if it doesn't go to trial? Yeah. [solemn music] How old is your son? He's eight. He's great. Ian? Ian, yeah. You'll meet him. HEDDA: Ian's mom. You. Thanks. No, thank you. For what? I'll tell you when I can. See ya.

They come out of blue sky. They come out of the blue. They come out of the blue sky. But you never know where they're gonna go. Hey, Romeo. Miller's fingers are traveling down the length of her thigh. But Miller's mind is still wandering, staring up at the sky. They come out of the blue sky. They come out of the blue.

Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't come around. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't come around. Please, don't. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't come around. Miller's angels are hovering in between the Earth and the sun. In the shadow of God's unwavering love, I am a fortunate son. They come out of the blue sky. They come out of the blue. They come out of the blue sky. But you never know where they're gonna go. Hey, Romeo. No, you never know where they're gonna go. Hey, hey, Romeo. No, you never know where you're gonna go. Hey, Romeo.
