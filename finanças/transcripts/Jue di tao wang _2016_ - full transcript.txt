We capture Victor Wong's man in that house with the Matador's product, we prove that Victor Wong is the Matador. Bennie, we 'II get him this time. We are not clear yet. Stay back. If this goes wrong, I'm not dragging you down with me. Stay put and cover me. Okay, I'm going in. How are we doing on the orders? Almost filled. Still some waiting on the next shipment. He's almost here. Keep packing. Be sure everything goes to plan. Hey. Be gentle. Mind the package. Oooh! Go take a look. See what's going on. Who are you? Take that! We gotta go. Esmond, get Leslie! I'm on it. - Stop them! - Go, go, go! Hong Kong reporter is live on the scene. Details are scarce at the moment, but it's believed a police drug raid gone wrong is responsible for the collapse of nearly a dozen homes. Captain T ang, I did it on my own. Victor Wong is a respectable businessman. In nine years, have you found a shred of hard evidence that Victor Wong is the Matador? There is no Matador. One man does not run the Hong Kong underworld, and even if he did, that man is not Victor Wong. You want justice for your partner. I understand that. But your obsession with this case has taken a toll on you personally. Take a month off. You should start thinking about retirement, Bennie. Sir. The Vory code in Russia says, "You mess with someone's family, there are grave consequences." Jesus Christ, Dima, you got the wrong guy. No! Well, I guess you're wondering how I got here, right? Allow me to explain. Whoa! He was just a local boy from the wrong side of the tracks, and she was engaged to a war hero. But love won out. Even after she got sick, they never regretted a thing. Would you shut up with that thing? A boy shouldn't be playing with dolls. Yes, Dad. Anyway, my dad would go to the hospital and read to my mom from her own journal and she would remember little moments of their life. They died in each others arms. Are you serious? He's literally reciting the plot to "The Notebook." Shhh. Shut up. I know it's corny. I just always believed in the power of love a little more than the regular guy. Jeez. Even now with the houses, and the Porsche, and the... other Porsche, I was just always holding out for a true love like that. I'm sorry. To answer your first question I'll have the chicken. Thanks. Oh. Sorry. Watch where you're going, asshole. I'm sorry. Purpose of your visit. Here to see the sights, but then again, what's there to see when the loveliest sight is right here? Welcome to Macau, Mr. Cunningham. Excuse me, I thought you were supposed to have a car here for me, right? No, no, I'm standing right here. Right now I don't see a car anywhere. I'm in front of the terminal. Hey, kid, I think this belongs to you. That's my toy. Thank you. All right. Take your bag, sir? Thanks. ♫ I wanna get into my car and drive ♫ ♫ The night is young and I'm feeling alive ♫ ♫ Well, you can tell by the way I prance ♫ ♫ I'm on the prowl and I'm looking my best ♫ ♫ I'm gonna climb the walls ♫ ♫ Gonna have it all ♫ ♫ I'm a livin' and a lovin' fireball ♫ Look what he got tonight! ♫ Longer than I walk the walk ♫ ♫ Well, this world is my oyster shell ♫ ♫ 'Cause I'm raisin' my share of hell ♫ ♫ I'm just havin' a ball ♫ Much obliged, everybody. Oh, man, ain't that the breaks, I... ♫ The first time I felt this way ♫ ♫ Was the first time I saw your face ♫ ♫ You were standing alone ♫ ♫ And your arrows were thrown to my heart ♫ That was quite a display. It's not everyday you meet an American that plays baccarat. It's not everyday I meet someone who leaves me speechless. Samantha. I run Guest Services for the casino. The hotel would like to offer you a suite for the evening, if you are interested. A suite? Well, that's a little cozier than what I'm used to, but... Ah, you know, just let me cash in my chips and I'll be all yours. Sure. Okay. ♫ Fortunate that we must meet ♫ ♫ To have just the chance ♫ ♫ At our dance with destiny. ♫ Sweetheart, didn't I tell you backlight's the key to these photos? You gotta use a flash. Oh, hey, will you take a photo of me and my gal? Please? Samantha. Boss. Enjoy. If you're taking a discreet photo, it helps to be discreet. Thanks for that. Why were you so nervous? Come on, he's my boss. I gotta be cool. Dealing with obnoxious gamblers like me night and day must get pretty exhausting. Occupational hazards. And you're not that obnoxious. Well, the night's still young. You eaten yet? Wanna grab some breakfast? I'll think about it. Okay, you think about it. Oh, back so soon. Sergei, ha! Man, you look different. Did you shave your back? Start walking upright? Heh! Good times. You think you can hide from us? Why did I have asparagus? Wait, I have money. I can pay now. Dima wants a word with you. So we take you back to Russia. Can't we just talk via Skype? You ladies didn't forget anything in the room, did you? Like say this. Ah! Hmm. Help me! Ah! Whoa! Hey, guys! What did I say? Let's go to Russia. I love Russia. Connor Watts should never have set foot onto the VIP floor using your key card. I just met the man last night. Whatever you think this video shows, you're wrong. You should have recognized him. He cheated this casino out of a million dollars. Samantha. Find him and you can fix it. I'll be keeping my eye on you, hmm? Send out everyone. I want him dead or alive. Okay... Hello? This is Leslie. Leslie, it's Bennie. I need to locate someone. Can you run the APB for me? His name is Connor Watts. Okay, got it. Bennie, I found him. Sending you his location now. Yep, looks like I screwed the pooch this time. Hello, Connor. Natalia! I believe you know my daughter, huh? Natalia, you told me your dad was a butcher. He is. Natalia said you were nice American. Very respectful. Otherwise you would be dead. I'm pregnant, Connor. Who? Connor, I'm pregnant. I don't believe you can get pregnant the way we did it. Not that we did it. You marry my daughter, I let you go. Whoa, whoa, whoa. We got a big misunderstanding here. Trust me, you don't want me to marry her. I mean, planning a wedding on such short notice is a logistical nightmare. Dasha, again. Oh! Oh, oh. Oh, oh, no. No hard feelings, Connor. Ah! - Connor Watts? - Who's asking? Bennie Chan. Hong Kong Police. Hong Kong? Whoa! Hey. I can only walk so fast. Whoa! Ah! Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me! Look out! Ah! Look out! Look out! Oh, God. Ah! Excuse me. Excuse me. Whoa! Ah! I don't mean to tell you your job, but I think taking a car would be faster. Connor Watts, you stole money from casino. I bring you back to Macau. Let's go. Give us the American. No one has to die. Sorry. Bennie! Hey, Bennie! A little help! Bennie! Hey, Bennie! Oh! Ooh! Bennie, help, help! Help, Bennie! Help! Help! It's about time. I'm telling Dima. So heavy. Not so rough. Hey! He's mine. Who is this man? A Chinese cop. Now get him! Hey, it's not honorable to fight girls. Then stop acting like one. Oh, ow! Ooh! Ooh! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Ow. You did not... Size D? Double D. Connor! What are you doing? Bennie! I was just trying to give us a head start. Uh. Thanks for opening the door. Go! So you're taking me back to Macau. That's my plan. You seem like such a great travel buddy. It's a shame I can't fly back with you. What do you mean? Don't you need a passport to fly? How did you get my lighter? Better question is how did I get your passport. We need to be there in two days. Hey, hey, hey, calm down a little. Ah! Don't you know there's an ancient Chinese proverb that says "Out of every crisis comes opportunity"? The 745 will be arriving on track eight. Please show your ticket before boarding. Thank you. Hey! Do you want some pizza? I'm ordering from the U.S. Embassy. Open up. I'm sorry, I can't hear you through this glass. Can you hear me now? Dude, you are stressed. Let's take a beat. Get you a massage. Maybe grab a margarita. You're wound up tighter than a... Ow! What was that for? Stress relief. You know, I'm actually feeling a little... Hey, hey! Excuse me. Please, my friend, low blood sugar. It looks like Connor Watts has left the country and Bennie Chan is on his trail. Bennie Chan? Eliminate them before they get back to Macau. Do not rest until that phone is safely in your hands. Understood. Our men are tracking him down as we speak. If you have to use Samantha, do it. You gotta teach me that two finger trick. Where did you learn that? Pro-wrestling? Only teach men of honor. Here. Eat. I'm a grown man, I don't need you to feed me. A grown man pays his debts. Keep your energy up. You know, I'm on kind of a cleanse. Eat it. Eat it! Mm. Nice and crunchy. What is it? Goat testicle. It's delicious. Bennie, you gotta try these. Mm-mm. I bet you can't eat just two. It's a righty. How about those guys who want to find me? It's not something I stole in Macau, Bennie. It's something I saw. What did you see? Tickets and passports, please. Let's go. Jump! No, you jump! I'm not asking twice. Jump! I thought you weren't asking twice. Fine. I jump, you fall! Unbelievable. My suit's filthy. - Uh, shut up. - Whatever. Look, why don't we do each other a favor, cut our losses and go our separate ways? This means nothing to you? He's gonna kill my Goddaughter. My family. I'll take you back to casino. I'm sorry. So you're working for them. I'm police. Honorable. There's something else you should know, your Honor. They don't want me because I stole something from them. They want me because I saw them shoot somebody. A woman died in my arms. Ester Yee! Help me. And you're telling me that if I don't go back with you then she dies. And I'm telling you if I go back with you, I'm going to die. They're gonna kill me. I don't care. I'm not loving the attitude, Bennie. You're tough, just like your father. What do you know about my father? - Nothing? - Nothing. I know this may not be what you want to hear, but there's no evidence of a murder at a Macau casino. If there was we'd know about it. I think he's lying to you, Bennie. I know. What the hell's he saying? I don't know. You must be kidding. This the one? 2016. 2012. Hmm? Okay. Visa or MasterCard? I don't know why it's not working. Money. We use one of yours. Where's your wallet? I don't have it. Why not? Forgive me for not being able to grab my wallet before being kidnapped. How about that nice watch of yours? Not my watch. No. Well, how bad do you want to get me in Macau, Bennie? Money, money, money, okay? You know, I think I got you figured out. Something tells me you're either unhappily married or there's no one waiting for you at home. You don't have me figured out. No, I'm not married. Shocking. Women do not go for that whole constipated Debbie Downer look. Lighten up. Smile a little, huh? Look, unzip my left pocket. There's something important in there. I promise. What's that? Right before the woman died she handed me that phone. It's okay, it's okay. Oh, no. It's okay. Shh, shh, shh. Oh, I'm dying. Here. Take this. Take this phone... You big dumb American stranger. Here, take it. Uh. Yeah, pretty much. There's something on there, Bennie. All you gotta do is charge it. Maybe you can trade it for your goddaughter. Enough. You will say anything to get away. I could have escaped already if I wanted. Sayonara, Bennie! Remember to smile! Stupid. Ah! ♫ Yeah, I'm moving, I'm moving on down the road ♫ Connor! ♫ You can't catch me ♫ ♫ 'Cause I'm moving on down the road ♫ That's more like it. Whoo! Come on. No! Come on, man. Come on! No, no, no, no! How about this? Keep pushing! 2012, my foot! Harder! Come on, ah! It says still have a half tank. No big deal. I saw a gas station 200 miles back. Get out of the car. Come on! We walk. Ugh. Here, come. What does that mean? What? Which foot? Jesus. Short cut. Can't a girl catch her breath? Whatever. What's the chance they'd settle for you bringing back some other white guy? I mean, we all look alike. Shut up. Where's this the shortcut to exactly? Shut up, Connor. I think the kid's hurt. - Let's check on him. - Yeah. Are you... are you okay? Do you need help? Water. Bye-bye, Bennie! Hey! Get off! Come on! - Bennie! Go, go, go, go! Oh! Shoot! Oh, ho-ho. Ow, my balls, my balls! Ow... Hey, hey, hey! Ooh, wow. You guys strong. You tell him, Bennie. No retreat! No surrender! Hit him in the ding ding. What's that? I don't get it. You just got your ass kicked and they're cheering. I fought with honor. You head-butted his balls. Oh, thank you. I think he wants us to have a drink with him. No, we got to go. Bennie, we can't be rude. One drink. One? One. All right, guys, who knows some good Mongolian drinking games? Drink up, drink up! ♫ Oh, I can feel it ♫ ♫ In the air tonight, tonight ♫ ♫ You know, I can feel it ♫ In the air tonight, tonight ♫ Ahhhhhhhhhhhh Ah Ah Ah. How do you do that?

"Rolling in the Deep" is a classic. Thanks for stepping in to fight the Mongolian stomper today. I know you weren't fighting for me, per se, but, still, you're a man with a code and I respect that. I'm willing to die for my loved ones. Without people to die for, no reason to live. Yeah, but there's no reason for life if you don't take time to enjoy it. You're too caught up in your job. You gotta get out there and meet some friends, and take a Pilates class, have some fun. You like that girl tonight? She liked you. Why didn't you talk to her? She didn't even notice me. When was the last time you connected with a lady? My fiancée, nine years ago. You never told me you were married. We not marry. She left me. Oh, I'm sorry. What happened? Victor Wong have her. The Matador. He killed my partner. I watch him die. After that... my life became revenge. I let everything it slip away. No! "Bennie, sorry I had to take off. Don't take it personally. I'm leaving you this phone because I think it might be of use. All you have to do is figure out a way to charge it. Thanks for the honor lessons, buddy. Connor." Hey, young boy. Did you see the American guy? Just last night. Buy my horse. He bought your horse? Cash? Damn dumbest horse in all of Mongolia. Come on. Vámonos. Vámonos. Come on! - Hey, hey! - Juh! Hey, Bennie, went to make a coffee run. I was gonna surprise you with a mocha Frappuccino. Bennie, Bennie, no, no. I bruise, I bruise, please. I bruise, I bruise, please. Please. You... I want my refund. You sold me a lemon, you little shit. You know, this kind of big horse only runs for a hundred miles. Small horse, run forever, stupid. I'll remember that the next time I'm in Mongolia. You had the money all the time? Just a little. For emergencies. You never stop lying. How your parents raise you? You don't know a thing about my parents. Everything you say is just horse apples. You see what I mean? Next time I talk to my bookie, "Hey, Sal, Sorry about that two grand, let me pay you with a wallet full of honor." Don't say a word. Bennie, Bennie, that's the guy! No, hey, be quiet. That's the guy who shot the girl in the casino. Victor Wong? Are you sure that's who you saw? He shot her at point blank range. That's not something you forget. I take you to Hong Kong. I spend my career trying to prove Mr. Wong is the Matador. Now you can. I'm taking you to testify against Wong. What? Victor Wong will see to it that I don't even get to trial. Your proof is on the phone. I'm not going. Hell, no. Okay. Just be quiet. All right. I'll play it cool. Help! He kidnapped me and he said he's going to use my pretty face to make a million dollars. Sorry! He had brain damage. I'm a loud, handsome, arrogant American and you have a lovely country and I will only ruin it, I promise. El diablo blanco. He drink too much baijiu. Call Hong Kong police. Call the U.S. Embassy. Stop. One at a time. He kidnapped me. I'm working a big case. Were you not listening? One at a time. Shut up! Both of you. He started it. He started it. Connor Watts, you're under arrest for the murder of Ester Yee. Who's Ester Yee? And Officer Chan, you are being charged with accessory to murder. This is a setup. Well, you two are going back to Hong Kong. Awesome. May be for the best, Bennie. Life in prison's better than getting killed by psychopaths. And jail might not be so bad. We can both get jacked, get some tattoos, maybe meet Morgan Freeman. The phone. We have to get it back. Do you see the situation we're in, Bennie? Impossible. Do you know there's a Chinese saying, "In every crisis there's opportunity." I found that more convincing when I was saying it. Ow! Who is she? She's the Siberian terminator. Dasha, what a coincidence. Of all the trucks to hijack. Where is the other one? I thought he's with you. Get out. My leg's asleep. You know it always does this on long trips. Ow. I said get out. I'm sorry. Bennie! You missed. Wow, you look great! Those headbutts to the face really treated you well. No, no, no, not the face. Thanks. I know this looks bad. There. Hey, hey, hey. I told you I don't fight women. I know, that's why I brought the gun. Okay, okay. Just one fight. Come. Good-bye, Chinese man. Now you are a killer. I didn't mean to. My leg hit the gear shift. It was an accident. You know, you are so unappreciative. She was about to kill you. That's no excuse. This... this is the reason I prefer public transportation. We only have one Earth, Bennie. Holy shit. Russians! Whoa! How about a little head's up next time? Let's go! Open it. Huh? Merry Christmas, compadre. All you gotta do is charge that thing and you're in business. You know, Bennie, I like you and I'm happy you're finally getting what you want. But sadly, I'm not gonna be around to see it happen. Your turn. You must be tired. Always running away. I mean it looks pretty tiring fighting as hard as you do. Impressed? No. I'm actually kinda pissed. Don't point that thing at me, man. Hurry up, hurry up! Which part of the pig am I blowing on? Is that what we're trying to make? The cops ask any questions, you just look at them like you don't understand a word, okay? Okay, that's good. Push harder! Harder! With this chopstick? Can't believe these things went out of style in the middle ages. So, what's the plan? We take the phone back to Hong Kong police. Captain Tang have to arrest Victor Wong. Well, great, you don't need me. You're the only tying Victor Wong to the phone. No you, no Wong. You have to testify. You got Samantha into this. Samantha's your Goddaughter? Well, I thought there's supposed to be like a billion people in this country. Rapids! Paddle! Whoa-ho! This ain't so bad, Bennie! You look like you've seen a ghost. Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho! Promise you'll let me go. Promise you'll testify. You're in no position to negotiate. No. I can't swim. I can't swim! I can't...! What? I can't swim. Shit. Oh, God. I got you. Whoa! Whoa! I can't believe you can't swim. No swimming pool in my neighborhood. Ah, ah, oh, God. For a second, I'm not sure you're gonna save me. I wasn't so sure either. Is Hong Kong nice this time of year? Don't play with me, Connor. I'll testify. For you. And for Samantha. Here. I think we're getting close. Captain Tang. I'm Samantha. I met you at my father's funeral. Yes, of course. I remember. I'm in trouble. I haven't been able to reach my Uncle Bennie in days. I didn't know where to go. He said you could help me. Yes, of course. Wow, it's beautiful. Kongming lanterns. You make a wish and let it float up to the sky. Hello? Hello. Would you like one? For me? Yes. Oh. Well, let's make a wish. To take down the Matador. To get Samantha back safely. Does that mean wish granted? Connor, you're right. I work too hard. Fight too hard. I have no life. That's okay, Bennie. Why don't we go find ourselves some power? Hurry up. I'm hurrying. Almost. Almost. Ready. Okay, let's do it. Thumbprint. Damn it. Good thing out of every crisis comes an opportunity. What are you talking about? If that's the Matador's phone, then only has thumbprint can activate it. If Victor Wong opens it... It shows that Victor's Wong is the Matador. We've located Chan and the American. Do not let her out of your sight until we return. I've got it under control. She's not going anywhere. Spread out. Find them. Ah-ah! I'll be damned. Why, you little... Come on, let's go. Mud festival. Good for harvest. Uh-oh, this is bad. I agree. Someone should tell them this is gonna have no effect on the harvest. I mean that's really bad. Oh. There! Get them! Now! Is this the kind of time we stay and fight, Bennie? This time we run. Oh, no, no. How do they keep finding us? No, no, no, no. ♫ Gonna take the shot ♫ ♫ Oh, yeah ♫ ♫ You don't know what's coming for you ♫ ♫ What's waiting for you ♫ Uh! I'm shot! No, no, you're not. Just popcorn. It's just some popcorn. ♫ Gonna take a shot ♫ ♫ Oh, yeah, All right ♫ ♫ Ruin what you can't fight ♫ Go, go! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! How do they keep finding us? The phone. What? They're tracking the phone. Turn it off. Hurry! It's so difficult. On and off is the simplest thing a phone does. Hurry! This is a hundred-family feast. All the families gather... Are you a Wikipedia all the time? Hey! Hey! Don't eat the food. No, no, no! Don't eat the food. I'm sorry, sorry. I'm sorry. We must sing to pass. It's a tradition. Well, what's not a tradition in this country? Sing something. Huh? Whoo! Whoo! All right! Chin chin. Well, go on, sing something. Sing so we can go through. Whoo! I can't swim. I'm scared of heights. New plan. Hurry up! Hurry up! There they are! What's the weight limit on this wire? I better go first. It might be safer. And don't tell me not to look down. Don't look down. Whoa! Oh-ho-ho! Whoa! Ah! Ah! I'm slipping. Easy on the ding-ding. What? It's the only thing I can hold! It's too small! This is a bad idea. Don't hang there. Use your feet! I told you it was a good plan. How long are you going to do this? Until we get to Hong Kong. No, I mean this. Chase guys like me halfway around the world. You know, you're no spring chicken anymore. I'm set in my own way. Not young enough to change. Well, you could still change if you wanted to. What would you do? I like alpacas. Okay. So we're talking about alpacas now. To me, they symbolize peace. I've always wanted to have one, but it's impossible in Hong Kong. Move out here to the country and have a whole pack of them. Hell, start an alpaca festival. Or do they already have one of those here? Listen, I think you did a really great job of looking after Samantha. Hey. Settle down, I'm being sincere. Look at me. When you see her, remember my face. No, I just mean even though you're a hard ass and short tempered and stubborn, mean... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, get to the compliments. Even though you're all those things, she turned out great. Without you, hell. Can I ask you a serious question, Bennie? How do you do the two fingered thing? Pressure. Pressure here, okay? You know, pressure. Pressure. Aw. What? You need to practice. Just not like aim it! Boom. Hey! You'll never learn. Uh! God! Shit! Whoa-ho, whoa, whoa! Need to keep body warm. Keep heat in. We don't have any blankets or fire. We're fu... We have each other. Take the clothes off. Oh, God. Somehow I knew it was going to come to this. How come you get to be the big spoon? Shut up, Connor. ♫ You can't fight it No, you can't fight it ♫ ♫ You can't fight it No, you can't fight it. ♫ Whoa! Just... whoa! - Whoa! - What are you doing? What? Eugene, one of them's come alive! Do you know where the gift shop is? It's not what you think. I need to call Sam. I really need to wash my hands. They were uncomfortably warm when I woke up. Hey. Hello. Sammy... Sammy! Hello! Samantha is just fine. If you hurt her, I promise... Bring the phone to the casino tonight or I'll kill your Sammy. No casino. We meet in public. Kai Tak Terminal, 7:00 p.m. Samantha okay? Look, I can explain that. I was gonna give that back. You have excuse for everything. You're a liar. Okay, fine. Total honesty, I wasn't gonna give it back, but that's when you were being a dick. Now that we're partners I was gonna surprise you and I was just looking for... I don't partner with cowards. You're bad luck. You make things worse. Oh, really? If it wasn't for me, you'd be moping around your apartment eating ramen, reading "Alpaca Daily." You say I'm lonely? If I'm lonely, what are you? Where's the picture of your family? Back off, Bennie. You have no one. You're right. I don't have anyone. All those stories about my mom and dad and how great they are, I made them up. I never knew them. They dumped me at birth. Does that make you happy? Can I have my jacket? You got the phone. So long, Bennie. Excuse me. Would you mind holding that for me? Yeah, okay. Thank you. Aw, come on, dude. You hand me an urn with somebody in it. Why are you so nosy? Why you look inside? Do you just walk around with that thing? Inside is my friend. Before he died, I promise him, I scatter his ashes in Victoria Harbor. I make a promise, now I'm doing it. Do you have a problem with that? No, sir. I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't realize. You about a 40 jacket? Bennie. You look well. Where's Samantha? Give me the phone. We can do this the hard way, if you'd prefer. Sure. Let's do this the hard way. Captain Tang, the phone has proof. Victor Wong is the Matador. It can only be unlocked by his thumbprint. Mr. Wong, would you mind humoring us? Not at all. How can this be? I'm not the Matador. I never was. My sincere apologies, Mr. Wong. Bennie Chan, you're under arrest for accessory to murder. Take him away. Hey, Natalia, it's Connor. How's Russia? How's your dad? Good. Listen, I want to ask you a favor. It's ridiculous how long you made me wait. How am I supposed to cross-process my client in a timely and litigious manner? Hey, Bennie. Connor, what are you doing here? Well, real men stay and deal with their problems. A wise man once taught me that. You guys familiar with the case Kramer v Kramer, because you're about to be? A little space. They're gonna arrest you. I'm your lawyer. So, what's the plan? I was hoping you had some ideas. You come barging in here with no plan to get out? Yeah, that's how we do in America, fast and loose. Bennie Chan's attorney's here to see you. I'm Connor Watts. Here we go. We're in. Thank you for saving us, Leslie. Thanks for letting me help. Well, maybe when this is over I could take you out for a chicken and beer? Yes, I'd love chicken and beer. Okay, we're ready. We've bypassed the thumbprint. Bennie, it just looks like gibberish. - It's nothing. - Wait. Stop right here. I know where to go, but we need a plan to get out of here. Wait up, wait up. This is the place. I bet it's the one with the armed thugs. You and I split up. Okay. Don't try to be a hero by yourself. Right, no need to start now. Go! Go! I had no choice. I did what I had to do to get the phone back... We never touched her, just scared her a little. Tell him, Willie. I was only following your orders. If I had known who she was... You liar. You couldn't have achieved any of this without me. I am the money man. You need me. That's where you're wrong, Victor. I don't need anyone. Help. You really don't know when to stop, do you? Connor? What the hell are you doing here? It's a long story. I'll tell you over breakfast. Forget breakfast. Where is Bennie? I have to go find something to open this with. I'll be right back. Don't you dare leave me here. I'm sorry I got you into this. Connor! Connor! Bennie, I tried to warn you. Captain, the phone. You're the Matador? He looks like the kid from Jerry Maguire. Thank you, Connor, for sticking with me. You're welcome, partner. Guns in the water. Now. Dasha! Oh, it's about time. Sorry we're late. Well, just glad you could make it. Welcome to the family, Connor. Thanks. - Family? Yeah, long story. Huh? Hello, Chinese man. Let's go. Hey, get 'em! Look out. Go get Samantha! Go! Go! Go! Hurry! Hey, gentle. Mind the packing. Cocaine. Yung. This is the Hong Kong Police Department. We have you surrounded. Bennie! The ship's sinking! Samantha! Ah! We have you surrounded. Hands behind your head. Connor, watch out! Freeze. Boss. Bennie! Bennie! Take care of my daughter. No! Bennie. No! I'm going to choose to remember him as he was before. My father died nine years ago. He was a good man. Best partner I ever had. Ahem. Best Chinese partner. Taking off for Russia tonight. Really? Why? A wise man once told me that honor is the most important thing in life. I made a promise and I intend to keep it. Sorry, Connor. Dos vedanya. Where are you taking me? You'll never get away with this. Will you pipe down? You're ruining the surprise. Was he always this grumpy? Hmm. Keep the blindfold on. All right. Okay. Surprise! You took me to my own farm? No, this! Wow! Alpacas. Wow! Thought this might keep you busy since you're no longer chasing bad guys. Hey, guys! Look at this. Tada! Bennie, you're famous! Ooh wee! Hey! Speaking of... Sam and I are going to go for a little walk. No, I go, too. Chaperone. Don't worry, Uncle Bennie, I still have the mace. Good. So all... Ow! Damn. What are you doing? It didn't work, did it? I told you. It takes practice. I've been practicing. So practice more. Are they gone? Yes. Bennie, are you okay? Bennie? Bennie. Are you okay? What have you done to him?
