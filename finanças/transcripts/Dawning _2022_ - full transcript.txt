Do whatever you want! No! No! Marcus You can share with me anything you'd like Your experiences, your past Everything that you're feeling during all this Showing me what's going on up here is going to help us work through all this down here You know? I feel like I'm relapsing Today's my dad's birthday He would have turned 62 Every birthday is just a reminder that I could have done something I should have gone after him If I had seen him as a person and not as a dad maybe I could have done something to help, you know? I was a kid, he was my dad When you're a kid, your dad's not a person. He's your dad Not a person with their own childhood pains and emotions Afraid to grow old Maybe if I had realized that sooner maybe I wouldn't be here I'd be at his birthday party I should have done something I could have gone after him but I just ignored him I feel like his death was my fault I could have done something, right? Are you okay? I'm sorry, did I say something? - No... I'm so sorry, I ... - You have a second? - Yeah, come in - So, your Monday is looking pretty easy You just got a 9AM with Tony, 10:30 with McKee and 3PM with Nick - Ah, I forgot to mention I won't be in on Monday - Oh! Will you be working from home? - No, I'm going to LA tomorrow morning I should be back by Tuesday - Sorry, I didn't see that in your schedule - Yeah, it was a last minute My sister's in trouble - Is she okay? - Boy trouble... - Men ... - Please ... Can we push my schedule next week? - Yes, I will move everything to Tuesday Do you want me to reach out to Krysta's office and reschedule lunch? - Ah, actually reschedule to next week Friday And then Marcus will be a weekly on Fridays and put him on my personal cell list In case he needs to reach me after hours - I will do that and ... Are you feeling better? - Yeah! I'm doing good - Did something happen earlier with Marcus? - I'm not sure... Chapter 12: The Dawning During my residency at the institute I had come across nearly every type of trauma there is Rape, abuse either that's sexual, physical or emotional Though the ones that stuck with me the most, peculiarly, are of those patients who watched these traumas unfold on the sidelines doing nothing While families crumbled in arguments in the quiet hours of the night these particular patients quietly escaped into the darkness often feeling too afraid to partake in the commotion Only later to awaken in the dawn of day with deep cutting scars, filled with guilt and shame Often feeling responsible for what conspired the previous night due to their lack of action These patients, unlike the common trauma I've mentioned were not the main target Trauma isn't biased It doesn't favor a type of relationship or seek the weakest of the branch It interrupts everyone at any moment, whether you want it or not That's what trauma does, it interrupts the plot It just happens and life goes on One of my former patient had a sibling that was abused by their alcoholic father Since they were young The father never laid his hands on my patient, only their sibling We were never sure why the father chose to be physically abusive to only one child. But one day, the abused child snapped My patient found them the next- - next morning, hanging on a tree it took years for this patient to recover Not only because of the horrific scene - Thank you Does someone live here? Yeah, it was okay Okay It's not your fault - I fucking hate him Asshole - Fuck you Jaesung! - Yeah! - No, it's work it can wait I'm on vacation! Right now, it's just you and me No one else - Okay! You and me! - That's not true! Bingo. Bingo. Bingo You're going to be okay - It helps me sleep Soojin? You have reached the Emerson Square Hospital in Manhattan If you're experiencing a life threatening emergency, hang up and dial 911 Stop! - Why'd you do that yesterday? Yeah - Tada! You've reached the voicemail of Jaesung Park After the beep, record your message You've reached the voicemail of Jaesung Park - Yeah, I can't find them - Why would you do that - Why'd you do it - Of course not, this is different - How is it not! Soojin - What can you tell me about your sister? - Kind She saw everything as an opportunity to better herself The opposite of me, really After dad died, when we were in high school she shut down. She didn't keep up with anyone she got really sick Eventually when we got older, I left for college in New York and she stayed back, because ... that farm became her little world - Do you still talk to your mom? What made you go back to the farm? - Soojin needed me - Did she call you? - Yeah - She called you and asked you to come? - Yeah Well, no Not really She didn't call I just knew she needed me there You know? She needed me - Haejin, do you remember what your sister did for a living? - She took over the farm after mom got sick - How about any relationships? Did she have a boyfriend, girlfriend? Any friends? - A boyfriend They recently broke up Jaesung - Anyone else? - No - When you went to the farm, did you notice anything out of the ordinary? - I thought it was weird where they slept and there was this thing A figure - Figure? - Nevermind - Haejin, do you know who I am? Do you recognize this place? - How is she doing? - Well, we're still waiting to hear back on a couple of tests But as of now, she's doing okay Though at this stage, it's difficult to tell if the latest treatment has been effective or not It appears that she's relapsed So the best that we can hope for is that she continues to stay stable and safe until we try any other tests Mrs. Park, I know that I've just recently taken on your daughter as a patient so ... not all the pieces of the puzzle have been put together for a lack of better words Haejin mentioned that she was with her sister? When you found Haejin at this farm, was her sister there as well? - Haejin had a sister - Where is she now? - Can I see her now? - Yes, of course Mrs. Park I just need your signatures on a couple of these documents and she'll be waiting in her room - You have a second? - Yeah, come in - What's so funny? We missed you, we were all so worried about you Just happy you're back Quite a trip you took What's wrong? I saw her, she was waiting for me I don't know why it took me so long You got to see her, right? You did good I wish I had a sister like you CODE BLUE - Oh my gosh, Marcus I'll be right back!
