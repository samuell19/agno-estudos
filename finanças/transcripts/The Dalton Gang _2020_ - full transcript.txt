(upbeat music) (hooves clomping) - God help me. - Dalton! You're makin' me mad, boy! (gentle music) (tree branches rustling) I know you're out. You caught me on a good day. Get on outta here. (gentle music) (tree branches rustling) I said go! (shot firing) (dramatic music) You shoulda never run, boy. (pensive music) (shot firing) (pensive music) (hooves clomping) (pensive music) (patrons chattering) - Bullshit. - Bob. - This is bullshit, Emmett. - What's wrong with Bob and Emmett? - Their brother Frank were found dead. - You mean Frank the deputy? - Aye, been missin' for a week. - Well, what happened? - His body was all shot up. Half his bleedin' face was blown off. Bob and Emmett had to identify the remains. - Well, hell. You can't blame 'em. Can you imagine if it was your brother? - Sure I can but I just don't want Bob startin' any trouble in here. - Did they know who did it? - They have someone in mind. (Terri sighs) - We need to be calm and think this through. - I am calm! When I found out who did it I'm gonna kill 'em. - You can't do that. - And why not? Did you see his body? - That'd be revenge, murder. They'll put you away for it. - I don't care! Don't you want these bastards to pay for what they did to Frank? - Of course I do. Got to let the lawmen do their job. - What a joke! There ain't no law in Kansas. That's what's the problem. (patrons chattering) - Well, what? - Join me. - [Emmett] Huh? - Join me. I'm gon' get me a badge and I'm gon' get these son of a bitches. I want you to join me. - I'll do it. - You will? - For Frank. (patrons chattering) I have to do this. - I'll get Grat to join us. I'll talk to him. - Okay. - Get you another drink? - No, but there's something else you can get for me woman. Hey, come back here. - You get your mitts of me girl, Slade. - Damn it, Bridget, she's a whore. Let her be a whore. - She's a good workin' girl who deserves to be paid. You still owe for your last two visits here. You square up and then she'll be nice to ya. - Fine. I'll be back on payday. - I know you will. (pensive music) - That was a nice funeral. - I appreciate all the folks who showed up. - He had a lotta friends. - Skeeter, do you understand what happened to Uncle Frank? - He ain't gonna be comin' around no more. - That's right. You're a smart boy. - I was hopin' I'd never have to see one of my boys die. I wasn't ready for it. - You're never ready for it. - Amen to that. - Uncle Frank was a sheriff. - Well, he was but that don't matter to some people. - Well, me and Emmett's gonna join up. - Are you gonna be a sheriff too? - That's right. That way we can track down who killed Frank. - And it'll all be legal. (pensive music) - Julia? - Yes, Emmett? - I'm gon' love you forever. - Don't say that, Emmett. Who knows what'll happen in the future. You could meet a pretty girl tomorrow mornin' that makes you forget all about me. - That's impossible. - Here you are promisin' the world again, but you just don't know. - Julia Johnson, will you marry... - Whoa! No way. You can't do that. You don't even have a ring. Did you plan this? - Well, no. - [Julia] You haven't even asked my father? - Do I really need to ask your father? - Yes, you most certainly do. What are you doin' Emmett? - I have no idea. I just want you to know that I love you. - [Julia] You can't just do that. - Do what? - You can't just act when somethin' pops into your head. Life doesn't work that way. - Who says? (Julia groans) - Emmett. - I'll do anything to be with you. What's so wrong with that? - Unbridled passion doesn't leave room for common sense, Emmett and honestly it scares me. If you really wanna marry me, you need to grow up and start doin' things right. I have to get home. Pa will be waiting. - [Emmett] I'll walk you. - With a shotgun. - I'll see you tomorrow. (gentle music) (grass rustling) (crickets chirping) (gentle music) (Bob groans) - Don't let it get the best of you, Bob. (Emmett laughs) (Bob yells) - Calm down, calm down. Let me see this darn thing. (Bob grunts) (Emmett laughs) Calm down, Bob. - Let me see if I can get it started. (crickets chirping) - [Emmett] Oh. There it goes. - [Bob] No it ain't, you lie. - No, I ain't lyin' there boy. - You lie. You lie. You know how I know you lie? - Why? - Your lips are movin'. (crickets chirping) Come on now. Ain't got all night. (crickets chirping) - You heard. (crickets chirping) - We can find somethin' that'll burn. That ain't gonna burn. What's this shit? Oh, shit. (fire crackling) (crickets chirping) - "Oh Emmett, I can't do it, I can't do it. "Oh, Emmett, I can't do it." (Grat laughs) (Emmett laughs) - Shut the hell up! (crickets chirping) (fire crackling) (Grat chuckles) (Bob chuckles) (hooves clomping) (pensive music) (twig snaps) (pensive music) - What is it, Bob? - I could swear I saw somethin'. (pensive music) (crickets chirping) Someone's messin' with us. - I think I heard it, too. - Give me three, two, one. - Three, two, one. (shots firing) (crickets chirping) (fire crackling) - I think we got him. (fire crackling) (crickets chirping) - Follow me, fellows. (fire crackling) (crickets chirping) (pensive music) Damn, it's Towerly! - We just got lucky, fellas. - We just got us some money. (pensive music) - What you mean there's no money? - Nothin'? - Sorry, boys. That note is only good for a year. (horse whinnies) - Why the hell did you plant those things to begin with? - Come on, Bob. Let's go. - I'm not done yet! - Bob, don't. - You almost got us killed, did you know that? - Look, I'm very grateful for all that you boys have done. The man was on the run for over a year. The money that was set aside for that had to be used for other things. You know how politicians are. My hands are tied. I had no control over that. If y'all'd agot him a couple months ago it'd had been all right. - You son of a bitch. You spent it on yourself didn't ya? (Mitchell sighs) We've been loyal to you. For almost two years we've been puttin' our ass on the line for you. - Always the same with you, ain't it, Bob? The world's out to get ya. You're just a model citizen. I tell you what, you're all fired. Get out! - But you still owe us. - Yeah, you can't just do that. - Look, you know what the Marshals are sayin' don't ya? They're sayin' the Dalton boys are up to no good. I hear tell y'all been out there sellin' whiskey on Indian territory. - Is that what this is about? - Sir, we really need the money. I plan on gettin' married when we get back to Coffeyville. - Get out of my office all of you. - But Sheriff... - The Dalton boys are hereby relieved of duty. - You're not relievin' the Dalton boys of shit! We quit. (badges clattering) (pensive music) Asshole. (pensive music) - You fellows wanna talk to me? - Yes, Sir. Thank you for makin' time. - I guess you heard about our brother, Frank. - I did. Sorry about your loss but I heard you brought in a killer. - They did. - I guess you heard about Sheriff Mitchell. - No, I ain't heard anything about the Sheriff. What about him? - The old bastard's holdin' out on us. - Says he's not gonna pay us the reward. - How much was the reward? - $2,000. - Fair piece of change. Why's he say he's not payin' it? - On account of the reward notice is over a year old. - He says it ain't no good no more. - The old bastard's keepin' it for himself. - That's mighty strong words, Mr. Dalton. I've known Mitchell for years. I don't think it's in his character. - Marshal, what we'd like to know, do we have any recourse through your office? - Unfortunately, the reward wasn't issued through our office. If it was it'd be backed by the U.S. government. - Well who's backin' it up? - Probably the county. - So then we can't do anything about it? - Well each county writes its own rules, but the important thing is that you boys stay in law enforcement. It'll be good for ya in the long run. - We already quit. - That's unfortunate. (gentle music) - [Curtis] Mr. Knowles, I know these time locks are a good idea, but can't we do somethin' about the cost? - Senator, there's a lot involved in this. I can make the October 1st deadline for delivery to the First National Bank as you requested, however, once the mechanicals are delivered, I'll have to engage my technical man to travel to Coffeyville. He has to engineer the device at your facility to the specifications of that particular vault. So the device will be delivered on the first of October and he will be there at some point during that first week to complete the installation. - Understood. What can I do to make this run smoothly? - I would strongly suggest that you bring one of your trusted employees up here to Topeka so that my office can train them on the day to day operations of the time log. - That's a good idea. - No extra charge for that training of course. Do you have someone in mind? - I think so. So Rebecca, is this your first trip to Topeka? - Yes, Sir. - [Curtis] So what'd ya think? - It's a right big town, Senator. - Compared to Coffeyville it is. How long you been workin' with us at the bank? - My 10th anniversary was last year. - That's great, that's great. You've done some mighty fine work for us. You brought a lot of business into the bank too and we're much appreciative. So how's it feel bein' the first lady assistant manager in this bank's history? - Oh, I take the responsibility very seriously. - I'm sure you do. Rebecca, I sent for you because there's a company here in Topeka that manufacturers reliable time locks for bank vaults. - What would that do for us? - The locks would be automatic. That means that no one, not even me, would have access after hours. - Okay. - I have set up a meeting for you with this company, and at this meeting you will learn the why's, wherefores, ins and outs of dealing with these time locks. - Certainly, Sir. When am I supposed to be gettin' this lock at the First National? - It'll be the same time as the bank across the street, October the 1st. (pensive music) - You boys want any more out of life than what we have? - I wanna get rich and sleep with a different whore every night. (all laughing) - I just wanna make an honest livin'. Buy some land. - What if I told you I could make both of your dreams come true? - Then I'd reckon Emmett would wanna switch dreams with me. - No, I wouldn't you dirty old dog. - "Oh Julia, oh Julia!" (Bob laughs) (Grat laughs) - Grat. - Listen. How much were we supposed to get paid for haulin' in that bandit? - That bounty was $2,000. - How much did that bandit have to steal to get that kinda bounty on his head? - Over 50,000 I'll say. - What, Bob? - Boys, it seems like we on the wrong side of the law. - What are you suggestin'? (Bob chuckles) - Let's be outlaws. - Different whore every night? - Two. (Grat chuckles) - I'm in. (Bob chuckles) - I can't be an outlaw. You crazy? - Come on little brother, we'll look after ya. - Damn right. - I'm gonna find a good job and I'm gonna marry Julia. - Believe me, Emmett, once you get a taste of this, you won't care anything about that girl. - I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with her and that means bein' a man. (Bob sighs) - Well, I thought you was a whole lot more loyal. - I am loyal to you, Bob. - Nevermind. Just, just go. - [Emmett] Well I am. - Go home, Emmett. Your future wife's waitin' on you. - Yeah, just go. - Emmett, don't tell anyone what we just talked about. (belt clinking) He better not tell Mama. - He's gon' tell everyone if you don't watch him. - Why the hell we gotta do all this target practicin'? - 'Cause we gon' be goin' up against some badass shooters. - Well, we're pretty good ourselves. - Yeah, but we gotta get better. - Quit your bellyachin' and shoot. (shots firing) (gentle music) You miss her don't you? - No. Look at this. - Here's where we start. The early train rides right by here, and there won't be a soul in sight. Now I'll take the lead. - What, wait, what? You said I can take the lead. - I changed my mind. - Why am I not surprised? You always need the glory don't ya, brother? - Grat, you don't know what you're talkin' about. - I'm talkin' about you hoggin' all the glory. You been doin' it since we was kids! - You wanna lead? Do you wanna lead, Grat? Who do you think is gonna be the first man shot dead if they see us? I'm leadin' this because you two are my brothers. My flesh and blood. - Can I ask a question? What are we talkin' about here? - Robbin' a train. - No we're not. - Ah, I don't know. - Well, what do you want outta life? - I'm not sure anymore. - What if I said you could have anything that little head of yours can dream of? - I guess I'd like that. - I need you onboard little brother. - I can't. - What? - You need to think hard about this. - How could I? Could you imagine the papers? The Dalton boys steal from little old ladies. Wait, I refuse until we get a real outlaw name. The Dalton Gang. - Hm, the Dalton Gang? I like that. - I love it. (Bob chuckles) - Let's just make sure it shows up in the papers like that. - That a boy, Emmett. - Hell yeah, brother. - The Dalton Gang. - Well, Skeeter, what is it you wanna talk to me about? - Well, Papa? - Yeah? - Why you gotta chase the train? - Well, we gon' have to stop it. - Well, why you gotta stop the train? - Probably a lotta money on it. - I thought you was good guys. - Well, we are the good guys. Sometimes we have to change sides. - Oh, okay. So are you a robber? - Somethin' like that. - Oh. (gentle music) - Good to see you, Caleb. What you need? - Railroad's got me goin' up and down them big hills just outside of Joplin again. - That's your regular route ain't it? - I'm holdin' a trainload of passengers and the railroad wants me to wait five hours so I can pick up the detectives they hired for protection and that's another car for them and another car for their horses. That's five hours if they're on time. - What, are you worried about the weight? - She's an old locomotive, Marshal, and there's some days she can't even hold her own. - Caleb, I know you don't wanna get hung up on one of them inclines, but I think that's a decision best left to the railroad. - I know what's best for my train, Marshal. And that stretch of land, chance of a robbery is very, very low. - Well, that's true. That's some very rough terrain, but you never know. - Nothing there but rough terrain and forest. - Well, what do you want me to do? - I got a train load of passengers who want to get to their destination. You can tell those detective boys I'll be back in about 24 hours and they can load up then. - I can relay your message but I cannot endorse you not havin' their kinda security on a trip like that. - I'm not askin' you to but thank you for your help, Marshal. (train chugging) (wind whistling) - Let's go. - See anything yet? - Nothin' just yet. Wait. - [Grat] What is it? - [Bob] It's the train. (train chugging) (pensive music) - You see Bob and Emmett? - Yeah but they're a pretty good piece away. (train chugging) They might make it. (upbeat music) (train chugging) They're movin' fast through those woods. - I see 'em now. Gon' be close. (train chugging) (upbeat music) - They made it. - How do you know? - The train's slowin' down. (train chugging) - Sweet. (train chugging) - Hey, hey, hey, listen up. It wasn't perfect. $6,000 richer than when we went in. Not bad, huh? And I wanna dedicate this to the person who gave us our name. Thank you little brother. - Wait to go little shit. - And that's why half the day's loot's goin' to you. - What? - That's really not necessary. - Damn right it's not. - Don't start with your shit, Grat. - I rode in second, I held up the train, I collected all the money. It don't make no sense you do me like that. - Well, here's the good news. It don't need to make sense to you. Sense is somethin' that leaders have. I automatically get half. That leaves you with nothin' today. But you got somethin' to look forward to on the next one, Grat. And I promise you it'll be bigger and better next time. - You think Frank woulda acted like this? - Frank is dead! - Bobby. - Frank died without a penny to his name, and I loved him just as much as anyone here but he was a damn fool. He tried to do right but the devil showed up at his door instead. I'm gon' find me a saloon and raise me some hell. Anybody wanna go? - I believe I'm gon' turn in for tonight. - Come on, Grat. I'll buy you a drink. Last chance little brother. - All right, all right. I'll go. - Oh, well, hell, let's get together next week. Sound good? (patrons chattering) - Hm, looks like them Dalton boys found themselves a good payday somewhere. - Aye, and they can stay until their pot of gold runs out. - Kinda makes you wonder thought don't it? - What are ya gettin' at? - That was a big damn train robbery yesterday. - I thought that was down the road a stretch? - It was but only about a day's ride. They had plenty of time to get here. - Marshal, do you really think that these boys could manage somethin' like that? - Well, I hope not especially with their background in law enforcement. Who knows. - I don't know. Bob and I do go a way back. - I understand. Would you do me favor? - What you be needin'? - Just kinda keep a tally on what they're spendin' tonight. I'll come by tomorrow and check up. - Aye, that I can do. - Ma'am. - Marshal. - Evenin' fellas. Enjoy yourselves. - What you say your name was? - Anne, for only the third time. - Anne, have you met my little brother? This is Emmett. - He's so cute. - Cute ain't the word for him. He saved my life earlier today. Say Pam... - It's Anne. - Whatever. Why don't you take Emmett up and show him a good time? - No, no, no, no, that would not be necessary. - What? You don't like what you see? - No, I mean, yes, I mean, damn you, Bob. - Look, my brother just had the best day of his life. It would be a shame if tonight was any different. - Come with me. - I really... (Bridget laughs) - Do your thing, Pam. - Bob, you son of a bitch. - Got a name Mr. Emmett? - Yes. - Well, care to share it with me? - Oh yeah, it's Dalton. Emmett Dalton. - That's nice. Now Emmett Dalton, take these clothes off me. Okay, then I'll take them off myself. - Wait. - What? What is it? - I just can't. - [Anne] Why? - I just, there's someone else. - Oh, you're married? - No. - Engaged? - Well, no. - So you have a girlfriend? - I think so. - Emmett Dalton, you're so sweet. You're really in love with someone. - Yeah. Yeah, guess I am. (gentle music) - Caleb, I'm pourin' myself a little brandy. Would you care for some? - Thank you Senator but unfortunately I am still technically on duty. - Well, the boss said it's okay, so with my permission... (brandy sloshing) - [Caleb] Thank you, Senator. - So Caleb, why don't you tell me in your own words what happened when those bandits hit your tain? - Well Sir, there is a good side and there is a bad side. The bad side is those fellas got away with a lot of money. - How much you think they got away with? - Difficult to say, Sir, but it had to be in the thousands. The train was full and passengers said they went around to everyone. - Well, the railroad's gonna have to reimburse everyone of those passengers and it's gon' be based on their statements. So it can get kinda tricky. So, what's the good side? - The good side is no one got hurt. It could've been much worse. - That is good. You know, I can't believe they chased that train down in that terrain. - Those heavy hills are hard even for a locomotive. They had to work for this. They knew what they were doing. - Marshal Fuller told me that you decided not to wait for the detectives to join you. - A number of passengers were getting restless. And I'm not so sure that having those detectives there would've been a great idea. - Well, why not? - These fellows were well trained professionals. This was a well planned operation. If a gun fight had erupted inside or around the train, there's no telling what could've happened. - That brings me to another question, one that the other engineers and I have been askin'. - Let me guess. You're thinking of arming the train crews? - So what are your thoughts on that? - We used to do that right after the war when the main problem was with the Indians. - So as one of our most experienced engineers, would you like a pistol and a shotgun to accompany ya in your journeys? - Let me say this Senator, if every outlaw followed some type of creed as these boys did, then the answer would be no, but some outlaws can be much worse. - Guess that's the essence of bein' an outlaw. - Understanding that I would sincerely appreciate the weaponry. (gentle music) - [Skeeter] Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew! Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew! Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew! (birds chirping) Pew, pew, pew! - Why is he wearin' that on his face, Elizabeth? - Pretendin' to be a bandit. He's been runnin' around all day tellin' everyone he wants their money. - Oh, really? He must be hearin' things people have been talkin' about. - He never played like this before. Wonder where he got that idea from. - I have no idea. Come here, boy. - [Skeeter] Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew! - Why are you dressed like that? - [Skeeter] I'm a robber. - A robber? - Yeah, I'm gonna rob me a train. When I grow up I'm gonna join a gang. (Bob chuckles) (birds chirping) (Bob sighs) - [Skeeter] Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew! (crickets chirping) - What's wrong with him? - He's afraid you're gonna be mad at him. (Bob sighs) - What did he do? - He found somethin' in the back yard. He dug it up. - What'd you find, Skeeter? - Nothin'. - A lot of money. - Yeah, I know. - Why is there money buried in the backyard? - I'm runnin' outta places to stash it. - What about the bank? - I don't think that's a good idea. - Do your brothers have piles of money laying around like this? - Uh, yeah. We've been at this for awhile. - How 'bout if I go to the bank? - I don't know. Maybe some of it. - Well, you need to talk to Skeeter. - Skeeter, you didn't do anything wrong. - Okay. Can I ask you somethin'? - Sure. - Can I buy somethin'? (Bob chuckles) - Where'd he run off to now? - Skeeter! - Hey! - You frightened me. - Get down off of that thing! Skeeter, go on over to the store with your mama. She might get you somethin'. - What you gonna be doin' in town, Bob? - I'm goin' to see Cricket at livery. - I think I'm gonna go talk to the girls at the general store. Maybe get him somethin'. - Okay. (leaves crunching) - You better be good if you wanna get somethin'. (leaves crunching) - [Bob] Hell up, Cricket! - Don't come any closer, Bob. I ain't got no money. - What's wrong with you, Cricket? - What do you want? - Well, I was hopin' to pick up a couple fresh horses. - Yeah? What you gonna use 'em for? - Business. - Would that be the kind of business that somebody get killed for? (Bob groans) - Cricket, we've known each other for a long time. - Things are different now. - Well, there's other people to sell horses. - Maybe, maybe you need to talk to one of them. (leaves crunching) - Good afternoon, Miss Elizabeth. Haven't seen you in awhile. - Yeah, I've been mindin' the place while Bob and the boys have been away. - What they been doin' while they're away? - Things. - We know what kinda things. - Look, I come in here to try to give y'all a little business. - She ain't doin' anything wrong, Pa. Not yet. - Well, I certainly didn't come in here to stand trial. - My father always told me you're only as good as the company you keep. - That's right, Pa. People will judge you by such things. - You might wanna keep that in mind. - So, what can I help you with? - Well, I was lookin' for a little somethin' for Skeeter here. - Well, that'd be fine if you wanna do some shoppin'. (leaves crunching) - [Bob] Skeeter, I thought I told you to get down off of there. - Let the boy play. He's just havin' fun. - What's wrong, Elizabeth? - I don't know if we're gonna be able to stay in this town, Bob. People don't treat us like they used to. - Yep. - Seems like, seems like the whole town's turning against us. - They'll get over it. - I hope so. - Bridget McGill. It is a pleasure to finally meet you. - Pleasure to meet you too, Senator. - Have a seat. I thought you had an Irish name, but now that I see ya and see that hair and hear that voice... - There's no doubt about it. Well, you know what they say about the Irish. Our feet may wander the world but our hearts are always in Ireland. - So how long you been in the States? - Took the boat in '80. Over a decade now. - Ireland's a beautiful country. So what would make you leave Ireland to come halfway around the world to the vast expanses of Coffeyville, Kansas? - Well, Sir, I was born at a right terrible time. The Great Hunger of '47. - [Curtis] The potato famine? - Aye. Me Ma and Da suffered through that horrible time. You can't very well run a pub when no one has a penny for a pint. The lucky ones left and many more died. I was the only one of the children to make it through. God rest their souls. And then there were fewer mouths to feed. But you be wonderin' how I got here. You know the blight returned in '79, but then Da had a friend in America who was lookin' for a wife. He paid for me crossin', and Da sent me off with the clothes on me back, a wish and a prayer. - And that got you to New York. - Me new man tried to run a pub, but the politics there weren't very friendly to the Irish and the peelers were always in your business. But I already crossed the sea so we decided to cross the land. We came to Kansas City and then down to Coffeyville. And then fortune began to smile on us. Course we ran a nice, clean place. He died a few years ago and now it's all mine, down to the dust on the floor. I'd be interested in knowin' why you sent me a round trip train ticket to come here? First class of all things. - So how long have you been runnin' your little saloon? - The Red Branch Pub established in '81. - Are you familiar with any of my business dealings? - You own a big piece of the First National Bank. - The largest part of the bank dealings is with the railroad. - Railroad pours a lot of money into the town. - It does and the railroad is about to expand their operations around the Coffeyville area. - That'll be bringin' in more people. - More people, more money, more opportunities, especially for folks like us. - So what are ya gettin' at? - I was wonderin' if you've ever considered havin' a partner? - The Red Branch is doin' grand with me as the proprietor. - I'd like to be a silent partner in this endeavor. - Now why would I be needin' a partner? - Bridget, I want to expand your business. You would give me a relatively high price for half ownership which more than likely I would accept and then I would turn around and invest more heavily in a larger endeavor. - What about me girls? - Oh, whoever you want workin' with you you have workin' with you. You're the operator. You keep who you want and you hire who you want and you fire who you want. - So, when would we be startin' this? (Curtis sighs) - The railroad has had two major adverse events in the past year, two major robberies. One more event like this and the railroad is considerin' pullin' out of the whole Coffeyville area. - Well, what can I do about those brigands? - The rumor is that the Dalton Gang is responsible for both of those robberies. - Hm. But there's no actual proof I'm thinkin'. - Correct. Are you familiar with the members of that outfit? - I can't say that the Dalton lads are regulars at the Red Branch but they've been there. - You had a very interesting clientele. I would like you to be very observant about any potential upcoming ventures. And you can enlist your girls to help you with this. Bridget this could mean a lotta money for everyone involved, especially us. (pensive music) - Hey Lizzi. Is Julia around? - I don't know where my sister is, but my Pa will be back any minute and he's gon' be right mad when he sees you. - You think she'll be surprised to see me? - Probably. What're you doin' here? - What do you mean? I'm home. - Everyone's lookin' for you and your brothers. - What're you talkin' about? - The whole town knows you been stealin'. (pensive music) - But... - You need to go. My father will be here soon. - I want to see Julia. - That's impossible, Emmett. It's been too long. - It's barely more than a year. - No, Emmett. It's not possible. - What do you mean, Lizzi, not possible? - She's gonna get married, Emmett. (pensive music) - What? Who? - His name is Robert Lewis. He's a good man.
