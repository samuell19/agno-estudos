And? Philippe? The mechanics have worked well. It's a beauty. What? A beauty. He smells of lubricating oil. That's part of the charm. I will not spoil the atmosphere... What? How long can float seaplane? You'll find only one way back. Just kidding. Relax. We are going home. Ready for landing? Shit! Dad... Dad... Philippe? No, it's me. Jean-Michel. We have to go. Leave me alone. I see! That's our house! Are we there, Dad? - Yes. Come on, Jean-Michel! - Wait, Philippe! I'm the first! So that's it. Not bad. - Nice is not it? And your invention... the regulator, you have paid for this? I could not pay my wages, Dad. No. Hands off, Philippe. So. That hurts? - What? Your scar. No, that's old. Your bone sticking out. Will not you help your mother? - No. Is the camera ready? We come! Do not fall in, Philippe. Hup. We are here. Come on, guys. Aside. I have two glasses. - I do not see anything. It is 50 meters deep. Go ahead. Put your foot in it. Philippe! Come on! I'll get you! - Nietes! Tikkie! Go play away. Careful, it is fragile. Quiet, boys. I'll get you! Caught! How do they breathe? That's a big say. Unbelievable. Look at those fish once. There. Bravo! Tailliez, Cousteau and Dumas, the Three Zeemusketiers! Four Musketeers! There are also four Zeemusketiers. And? Is everything to your liking? When you go down, I need you... And? - A success. Really? Did you see that? - What? If Tailliez speaks a girl... st... st... he stutters. And how handsome she is... - How worse. My mother wanted a son. She prayed day and night and candles burned. When the delivery came and bingo! A boy. She was overjoyed. They showed the baby and the doctor said: "Wait, there's another one!" A little brother. No, sister. If she could have drowned me, they had done it. I take her briefly. See you later. Tailored. Small size, just like you. I've been waiting for hours! Listen carefully. quiet breathing and not let you die. Come on. Philippe! Come on, Jean-Michel. Wait! - I'm cold. Come on, Jean-Michel, we do it quietly. Do not worry. Did you see that? A shooting star. I saw it. - Me too. He did whiz. He was beautiful. I make a wish, right? Okay. But do not say, huh? What are you doing over there? Say it. I can not sleep. And that's why you're in my stuff? What are you doing there with your nose? Where is this seat for, dad? That's an aviator. As a pilot? An aircraft. What did you think? To bed. - Why are you not a pilot anymore? Because of my arm. This arm is too weak. I could not be a pilot. You know. Are you crashed through your scar? It is like this... it was an accident. A car accident. I was really in love with your mother and I wanted quickly to her. When you're in love, you do stupid things. Well. Are you sad? Sad? Why would I? Because you can not fly. Flying is cool. You fly through the clouds... You can create loops. Yes, but now I swim. And that is much more fun. I'd rather fly. Oh yeah? Then fly to your room. Give me a kiss. Come on, get out. Philippe. What? Here. Can I have it? - Yes. Really? Really. But only if you go to bed. Hup! With each breath the diver escape there silver bells as a symbol of life. But we must go back to the light and unfortunately abandoned this promising world. END It is catching on. Come on, it's on you. We come. What Zeemusketier is the spokesperson? Who's the boss? So you breathe underwater? Yes. We are... from... equipped with a a... equipped with a a... ... a regulator... He breathes underwater, but not on dry land! You are equipped with a "regulator"? Help him, he drowns! The regulator that has developed... Lieutenant? Breathe, dude! He gets mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Yes that's right. Good evening. With this equipment we can breathe underwater, free as a fish without effort. Thanks to this invention, man can live up to its century-old dream. Fly. Because once underwater, you're totally weightless. Upstairs you have your beautiful sunlight. And you, getting darker blue. You swim between those two worlds, far from the people, the noise, silent. And the sea... The sea surrounds you, carries you, rocking... Thanks. "Closer to Antarctica There were more and ever larger icebergs. There burrowed thousands of birds pool. captain Nemo scrutinized leaving area. Did he think he was in the polar seas, forbidden to humans, at home, master of that inaccessible areas? Maybe. " Goodnight. Good night, Daddy. Turn off the light. What are you doing? Look at all that blue, Loubi. Imagine what there is to discover. What lurks there? Imagine... A world that is yet to be discovered. What are we waiting for? The Calypso. A minesweeper, built in 1941 on the site of Seattle. 42 meters. 400 tons and two engines of 580 hp. You do not buy? - Yes. I have an English sponsor. Sir Loel Guinness. He bought the Calypso and want him to let me for one franc a year. That's reasonable. More is not worth it. He also pays the refurbishment? I do not think so. Jacques has promised never to ask him a penny. Smart Brit. We celebrate. Where are the bottles? Those are cool. - I will go. Is that true? you get away from the Navy? - Yes. How do you maintain your family? Simone knows about it? It was her idea. How come? Her father and grandfather were admiral. You're both crazy. Look. Is not that enough? That interests me there. And before that offering you everything? What keeps you here? I have everything I want. It's madness. We can get the boat even in Malta. We'll think of something. Tomorrow I call Guinness to say it. Where are you going? Where I come from, you mean? The safe in the bank. For the fuel. And repairs. And the rest. No no no. No way. Jacques... I do not care about my mother's jewelry. But the boat we make our dream come true. You're crazy. This is ie dan. Good. To work. Excuse me, sir. Hey. Are you Jacques Cousteau? Yes. I'm diver. No professionals. I am a truck driver. But it's my passion. When I can, I go scuba diving. I have no regulator, but I tried one. It's... it's... I love you no longer. Here is my resume, to have in case you need someone. A diver. Sorry. You get a different me. I will return. - Give me that. Good. What's your name? Falco Albert. But everyone calls me Bébert. If you are looking for work as a diver... then you start this. Okay! Wait, Falco! Say Bébert, captain. So do your dirty clothes. - So what? Bébert! Yes. - Who told you about the Calypso? Everybody talks about it. Everybody. That man over there is my father. Just ask him. Everything fine? Yes. PETROLEUM INSTITUTE Our goal is to investigate the seabed worldwide. We begin at the Mediterranean Sea. Has confirmed my lunch? Yes. Your usual table. Beautiful. We take our scientists aboard oceanographic vessel who first studied the marine flora and fauna. We also take note filmmakers, so a wide audience can share in our expeditions. What exactly do you expect from us? Fuel. Free. Why? Our films are screened worldwide. That is advertising for you. Advertising. How much fuel will consume your oceanographic ship? One and a half tons per day. I understand that you are looking for a sponsor. Let that sit chatter. Have you heard about offshore drilling? No. A ton per day. - One and a half tons. Then you also know that we consume more and more oil. So we must always find new oil fields worldwide. The latest idea is to drill into the sea. Offshore Platforms. According to geologists This region is full of oil. But before we invest billions, we want security. And before that We must emerge samples. Did you divers? - The best. We give you oil. Plus a bonus if you succeed. The swarming with sharks and it is very hot. Abu Dhabi... the Strait of Hormuz... and the Gulf of Oman. This is a nice trip. Well I married a sailor. When I was a pilot, though. I saw the sailor al. And the children? I want my own cabin. I called Les Roches. That is a blow. Nobody dies at boarding school. I'm not going! Philippe! Philippe! Come back! Philippe! Beware! What are you doing now? I hate you! Cousteau is crying. What is it? Nothing, sir. I do not want to hear. Do not pretend. We know you can not read. You're stupid. You can not read. Day, kid. We are finally in the land of camels. I wrote you about. The sea is as blue as in Bandol. It's so hot that diving barely cools. Yesterday I went along. It was beautiful. Fish everywhere around me... The Golden Palm for best film is awarded to... The Golden Palm was Le monde du silence under water filmed by master Cousteau. The French discovered to their surprise they are interested... A tool for oceanographic research... Calypso, an oceanographic vessel... Albert Falco, chief diver... - Live from Marseille. You're the first man who lives in an underwater... RED SEA - SUDAN July 1963 Everything fine? - Yes. Welcome. How is it, Mama? And with you? - Fine. I'm glad we're here. - Yeah right. Your father is in the back. Everything fine? - With you? Yes. Hey. There they are. I thought you guys next week arrived. No, it was today. I get a hug? Come here. Do you have a suit? The Precontinent II and the "oceanauten" who... No. Louis, I'm talking about. The Precontinent II and the "oceanauten" proven that man can live underwater. Cheers! Can we eat quietly? I'm sick of those cameras. You eat everything! There remains. Yes, it vegetable. When does your school? In September. Do you like it? Movies do. The course not. Come and join us. He must go to school. That makes no sense. Did you tell Dad about your idea? I'm an architecture which direction you like. Under Engineering. That's an idea. That's the future. And I am the first. You already have a customer. He gets plenty of customers. Philippe, tonight we film the houses. Will you help us? Yes. Why not? Anyway, I have an idea for a recording. We begin with a long tracking shot in the dark. A recording of the porthole with the men in it, moving, smoking, talking... And after that... We move slowly. We go slowly, endlessly. The porthole only a bright spot in the ocean. And... that is it. That can be beautiful. We'll do it tonight. Okay. These are only the first discoveries. Le Monde Sans soleil promises you a lot of new adventures. END There is our oceanographic ship, the Calypso, That is being repaired now. His place of expedition is here in Marseille. Do you come along? We have grouped all our research activities here. Because it's only the beginning of the adventure. This way, please. The Americans conquer the space. We conquer the sea. Here, our people design and build the latest inventions What we do Can continue to... and especially deeper. Everything fine? This is the agency's engineers. How are you, René? - Good. Some of you know Andre Laban, the chief engineer working on our next big project: Precontinent III. Where are you going? - Be right back. Finished painting? - Done whining? Comma Deer not me. I'm just doing my job. I get the impression that you miss me when I'm not. These men, these modern equipment, serve only one purpose: Conquer the last unknown area in the world. The sea. The sea and its vast wealth awaits us. You want to talk about money again. Jacques, I can not pay this month wages. Again not? The discovery of the sea is nice, but there... and that... I think you have to set priorities. Money you will always find. Good. Say it. How much do you need until then? You can not be paid wages. How much? Just over 200. 217,000 francs to be exact. And we end the evening with... Loubi? Françoise Landeau invites you to the live broadcast our program... you look all day for that thing? Loubi! Are you at home? What have you done to your hair? This was in your jacket. I brought to the dry cleaner. "My dear Jacques, every hour without you takes ages." Stop. "I dreamed you lay next to me..." Stop! Yes, it's mediocre. She must have other qualities. Say something! Talk to me! Say something to me! Sorry. Where are you going? Home. In my boat. We're too late. We're too late! We have the bathyscaphe but we also have two mini-submarines which we can reach depths who has never seen the man. be equipped divers with streamlined scuba programs with built-in lights and a system communication. Look. Like James Bond. We send all animal documentaries. No, you misunderstand. We have not explained well. I do not make animal documentaries. I tell people about to discover a new world. The captain and several people around him. His right Bébert. His wife, Simone, very popular with the crew. The son, like a movie star, Philippe. Viewers travel with us all the world's oceans. They discover, investigate, they share our emotions. They are worried about us. They tremble, laugh and cry. The viewer does not but to fish for people. And I want to show them. How many movies? Twelve. Six! Twelve. Hey? Are you ready? Yes. No... Almost. I'm checking out. At 11:00 am in the lobby? Okay. Until so. Stay here. Come with me. The US contract finance our ambitions. But we must organize ourselves. We take it big. There is a production office in Los Angeles, next in Paris. We develop research activities here in Marseille. Labanus will control. We obviously love a team of scientists at the museum in Monaco. And we renovate the Calypso, because that will sail three years to make 12 films for the Americans. and Philippe send it to. Strait of Hormuz - OMAN April 1967 Good morning. - Hey. The starboard engine still vibrates. Are you deafened by diving? I report it to Titi. Muscadet at breakfast? Thirty years. I feel fine. Feel my muscles. No thanks. Never thought you would ever write much. So it goes when you're in love. Goh says. You do not like that? That depends on your girlfriend. I suggest her to you. Men, we have bite! We have bites. To pick up! Where is he? Say so Can you see him? There, I saw him! There. A monster. My God. What a beast. No bruising. And never lose sight of them. When they come close... Take these. Philippe, do you listen? Yes. But you have already told thirty times. Philippe... Thank you Okay. The cage comes at 6 meters for a quiet decompression In all safety. If they become aggressive, you'll stand back with your back. You two stay together. I watch Philippe. And we stay in the car, okay? Come on, guys. I can still sell a kick! Quiet, say. Idiot! - Because I'm not afraid? This was dangerous. We are here to film! You never cop. I do my work. It's my film. Who are you? The son of dad. What did you say? All right, boy? Yes. With you? Fine. Doctor Clark, of the zoology department Maryland. My son Philippe. Pleasant. Come on. The largest shark specialist in the world. Impressive. No luggage? I travel light. Beautiful. It has been flying for an hour. Afraid to catch cold? Traditional scuba divers cap. Our new uniform. The crew must be instantly recognizable. I got one for you. Is that real? It does well on TV. If I had asked 0.1% of all oil wells I've found them to... Then you would not make TV movies. I have a surprise. I'll take it. What are you doing? I'm going to fly. I got my pilot's license. Why did not you say? What? - Why do you say that? I do not know. I thought that... Can you fly do with this? I flew here. Do not pass it over. That's an order, okay? Do not you really want to... Everything is fine. Thank you That's nice music. I'm not in the mood, Bébert. The doctor Clark... Forgot to tell her her first name? Beautiful name, "Emilie." I do not want women on board. This boat is my house. I thought I had said that. You see enough ladies ashore. The organization remains behind. I think we... Did you hear me Yes. Did you understand? Yes, I understood. Somebody needs to travel for the Calypso. A reliable person who prepares everything in advance. What do you think? - Call your son. Your other son. Jean-Michel. And architects? Customers are not exactly in line. Call him. I'm old and ugly, just to annoy you. I will always love you. Even if you're old and ugly. You bring it, Jacques. Welcome. Have a seat. Thank you. Captain Cousteau, will man really colonize the sea? Absolutely. I think that soon is a Gay aquaticus that can live under water. a branch via a chemical cartridge provides the blood with oxygen and thanks to artificial gills rediscovered man than Its original environment, The water world. With the help of science Man does not know any boundaries. I believe that. CAPE TOWN - SOUTH AFRICA May 1968 What are they doing now? We have to catch sea lions to study them. Sorry, Captain, but I do not understand. It's very simple. We're late. Now the weather is good. You have to cross the ocean with the sea lions. But what do we do with that? We're making a movie, Bébert. A nice story about friendship Between crew and wildlife. Of course Once at sea you let them out. Shed some scenes. I write some ideas to you. And we must give them names. Pepito? In that song. They're fighting! Oh no. What is going on? Your husband is an idiot. An old fool. - Do not start again. She winds up, but it'll be fine. Do you really think so? You really do anything for money. What do you mean? You fucking movies. Those poor animals die in their cage. But who cares? Because you're making a movie. That after all is about. So you have a nice story megalomaniac. Captain Cousteau befriend Wildlife. Great, just Disney. All nonsense! And you know that! Everyone knows that. Yes, I tell a story. I have to make films. observe contracts. And I have to pay every month 150 people. And you is part of that! I have good news. You still 149. Bébert, go ahead. Mama, I'm leaving. I'm going to marry John. I wish we were together. Do not leave me alone with my grief. We can organize something in Monaco with your friends and mine. Otherwise we will organize a small ceremony in Paris. Mama, please. Life is so much better together. I love you. Write me. Is something wrong? I'm jealous, Bébert. But... by whom? On others. All other women. Good. What are we eating? Come on. Here first... the Center for Research in Marseille. We develop projects like the underwater housing. In Paris we have the headquarters Requins Associés producing movies. In the U.S two production companies. One makes documentaries only, 60% in France, 40% in the US... There, look! There! Of course, somewhere in the world... Calypso. That is it. I search for a CFO. You have done anyway Harvard? Yes. Here I first dived I wanted to see. I check anything. Ready? Is underwater cave a good idea? Trust me. It is fantastic. Just like swimming in an aquarium. That you like. Here we go. Grandpa is dead. What do you say? I do not hear you. Grandpa is dead. Do you understand me? I'm coming. Yes, I've heard. The funeral is tomorrow. Can you be? I can not for Monday. Tomorrow? No, the 29th. That's about a week! I'm not coming. It's your father! I know, but he's dead. Life goes on. What do you want? I try to postpone the funeral. Do what you can. Bye. I come, I come. Philippe forms now his own team? Yes, he wants to work other topics. Ecology. Like a warm applause For Mr. Jacques Cousteau! Congratulations. Thank you. CALIFORNIA - MEXICO November 1971 Well done. We will install ourselves there. He went into hiding! I rely on it. Sweetheart... Look. This is our home. Hey. Captain? Henri. - How are ? We have to talk. What is it? Some whales are already disappeared from the Atlantic by intensive hunting. Here they are threatened by pollution. Do you mean oil spills? Oil spills, heavy metals, waste... Making it up. Give me the guitar. And? I have French papers. Beautiful. 20 MILLION BOTTOM OF THE SEA COUSTEAU drowning in DEBTS That old observation buoy... - which was not burned? No, we will use again. And this is a completely new idea. A revolutionary drive system. And here, of course... our last baby, Argyronète the submarine. The hull has just finished. Nautilus Captain Nemo. Ideal to keep your pipeline. I am glad to see that it goes well. Have you read the press? - It's probably an exaggeration. What budget problems. Etienne, We both know the future, investigation, not a matter of accounting matters. We've supported for 15 years. I know I can count on you. I admire you, JYC. You made the impossible possible. unfortunately that time is past. Your view of the sea is romantic. Underwater life is no longer the future. Those "oceanauten" from you... That those houses under water is fun for the masses and for good stories on TV. Robots are the future. Less expensive. Less risky. No decompression problems. You have a lot of fun. Maybe it's time to... Laban also? And that will not be enough. All those layoffs are not enough. Your dad must sell the Calypso. It's a bottomless pit. Otherwise, he loses everything. tax, overdue premiums... Did you overrated? Money is a tool. If I had thought about it, I had done less than a tenth of everything The financiers think only of profit. Would you turn that off? Even the government lets us... Thanks. Bébert wanted to fix shelves but something was missing. What is it? Nothing. Light bulbs are not here? - They have never located there. They say that the Calypso is too old. Too expensive. We have to sell him. We never listened to them. What are you talking about now? - No, I know. You travel around the world. I live on the boat. Throughout the year. With my men. This boat is my home. It's my life. And I want to stay that way. Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea Has anyone ever been there? Yes, explorers. Not a deposit. I remind you they get two movies. They have paid for. You will not get dollars more of them loose. Unfortunately we leave this paradise. But Calypso, insensitive for nostalgia, again set sail for new adventures. And? Did you find it? We would know what to see. Where are the other two films you would make? This year. I'm going to deliver four films. Which I explain. This is my greatest expedition. I'm going to last... Discover pristine area. Antarctica. Frozen landscapes, The white continent, icebergs, Whales, penguins. Places where human beings Never doped. I already have the title: Travel to the end of the world. Such an expedition requires New diving equipment, A special boat, an ice breaker. David... How much is that going to cost? About five million. No way. How much or how much? A million. Max. Agreed. You do not have an ice breaker yet. An ice breaker? Not necessary. I'm going with the Calypso. The Calypso in Antarctica! Absolutely. Great idea. It's a very good boat. He saves it. It's an old boat. Very old. With an old master? With a wooden hull. This sail through the ice suicide. Not exaggerate. You know it's true. You think I have a choice? Is it that bad? Do you know, I have the impression that I have been my whole life to chase money. What do you want? I want you to go. Antarctica! You can not miss it. Sorry to bother you. A signature? Of course. I admire you tremendously. These two lions, their names... Pepito and Cristobal. They were so cute. Compliments. Thanks. Have A Nice Day. They recognized you not... - Yes. I no signature part. I think that's stupid. It's not a suicide. It is a very beautiful and very grand adventure. We make a good team. Stop. Do not bother. - Think about it. That's not necessary. It is no. I do not understand. Oh no? Yet it is simple. I prefer Philippe Cousteau the son of Captain Cousteau. I did not know it was so hard. Because you never wondered that. Okay. You have to go. No not at all. You never asked you out, because you do not care. The funniest is still all those years when I saw you proceed, resolute, confident, I admired you. I have so admired, dad. So huge. But now I understand you only think about yourself. And that's always been. You have fun with your toys, your inventions, your desires, your dreams, your conquests... And the rest... you do not care. You're right. I had no children should receive. And I wanted to have another father. Good. you think of mom? All the time. USHUAIA - TIERRA DEL FUEGO December 1972 Think of the valves! Good to see you. How are you? This is nice. Yes. Hello I do not know when you read this But after a few days at sea Brings writing Me closer to you The sea seems like this Wider than elsewhere. We will see the first islands soon. I want to discover that unknown world. All right, madam? Do you need something? Heat! I freeze something. Thanks to satellite observations, we could leave Ushuaia With more favorable weather forecasts. We are going to those islands above the Antarctic Peninsula, Known About their large number of marine mammals. Blue whales, gray whales. Do you, Colin? It insists captain. Madness. We have not seen a whale. That is something. What is that now? Whalers. They have them slaughtered. They slaughtered them and moved on. Always the same song. Damn. Can we westerly around it? About. Depression is increasing rapidly. Go back and go hide. Otherwise it becomes a hell. About. Roger. you follow the instructions? About. See you later. Over and out. It stays light at night. That is inhumane. Did I miss something? It's quite a blow, Bébert. Capt. We are here. Wipe your soles. They're full of fat. A leopard seal swam to the camera. I thought he would eat it. Not too short. Rest assured, Bébert. We'll be there a while since. Alain! Thanks. Bébert. Thanks. JYC. Thank you honey. The Shepherdess! The Shepherdess! Merry Christmas, sweetheart. I've never felt anything like it in 30 years. Not since Tailliez me lent his mask, made from an inner tube. I remember how it felt, the first time underwater. The immensity. The silence. Purity. 30 years ago I discovered a new world. I wanted to show. I wanted to find him. I wanted to tell about it. And I wanted to conquer him. But we had to protect him. But that may yet. That could. Idiots! nobody buys ecology documentaries. Because TV stations no hassles like industrialists. Where is the car? they pollute but they advertise! Stop those leftist talk. We do not need them. The oceans are in danger. I announce the creation the Cousteau Society, a non-profit organization with the aim of protecting nature. That polluting industries, is not out of cynicism. They do not destroy the earth. They would best regulatory to obey. But politicians do nothing. Who remember the elections. With the money we collect, we can make our documentaries and the public awareness the need for conservation. We need to make a move, that governments will take action conservation. My son Philippe and I will give lectures. We're going to meet people. And do you that the public is coming down? It is thought that the sea is so vast, that man never destroys him. That's a mistake. One day we can not swimming in the sea because only simple organisms such as bacteria and viruses survive the pollution. The longer we wait, the poorer the earth is that we want to save. Then with the Calypso. Rivers, lakes... Fresh water is a big problem. We need to discuss. The Calypso II. We have the power to act as global citizens. For our children and our grandchildren we can change things. This is our planet. The only one we have. We have corrupted the earth during the 20th century than in all previous centuries. Do you want to try? What? Do you want to try? You're the pilot. Thanks. We live in an infinite succession of absurdities imposed by the blind logic short-termism. Overcrowding, South-North gap, climate change, of all kinds, elimination of thousands of species, the dictatorship of materialism. The only remedy is the shelter the utopia! Of course I want to talk to her. Dad? How are you, little one? I'm not a small one. Are you not a small one? Are you a big girl now? - Yes. Would you like a brother or a sister? A little brother. . - A brother You're right, dear. I have to go. I love you. I love you. See you tomorrow. Dad? Yes. What? I keep hoping until it is found. But the press already know about it. Simone can not hear on the radio. Invent anything. I'll call back. Well, captain. From European side, it adheres to Horizon 1985 the import limit for oil... Inside. In election time Jimmy Carter can do little, Because he is raising the fury of Congress. Do you remember... That you promised me To engage in classical music? Would it be you now Come true? If you want, Bébert. New developments Do you like it? Yes. Certainly, Madam. It is beautiful. I'll be right back. Philippe... His watercraft. An accident. He is... Go away. Leave me alone. I have drawn all the papers. I brought clothes so they could pick him up. It is my fault. I feel so lonely. So alone. I'm here. I will help you. We go on. Together. I have not the strength. Remember when we looked at the sky? You told us about the stars. The galaxies. And one night you told us: "If you once are very unhappy, remember that we are but dust... " A pair of star cases atoms. We are here only briefly. Just one glance at the scale of the universe. So enjoy it. Enjoy it. Life is stronger than anything else. So we continue to live. Jacques Cousteau has lived for years. Together with his crew the captain delivered a great struggle for the environment. His ultimate victory was an international moratorium the extraction of natural resources in Antarctica until 2048. But in recent years have several countries to raise because of the resources that form under the ice. More than ever is the battle to protect the earth. The Cousteau Society has not cooperated in this film. This film is based on elements of biography of Jacques Cousteau which are generally known. The screenplay is loosely based on Mon père le Commandant by Jean-Michel Cousteau and Capitaine de la Calypso Albert Falco and Yves Paccalet. Jerôme Salle has done much research and recorded numerous statements, especially the former crew of Cousteau, for making this film. The film focuses on the first family of Cousteau.
