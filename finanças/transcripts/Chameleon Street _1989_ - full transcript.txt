Now Have you thought about what you're going to do on the outside? Mmmm Let me put it this way. Once you get out, will there be any more of these? No, no. I'm through. No more. No more impersonations? No. Enough is enough. I don't believe you. Would I lie? I don't think you're necessarily lying. I don't think you're in control of what you do or say. I think you behave in complementarity. Okay... - Do you know what that means? - No. That means you intuit what another person needs, and then you become that need. Like right now, you know my job is to diagnose your neuroses. "Neuroses are red, neurosis are blue..." [DISTORTED INNER VOICES]: Sit down... Gotta be tight... Shut up... For the first time, it's like... Don't cross me... As tired as the paint on these walls. I'm about to suffocate. The Chameleon is about to confess. I think, therefore I scam. I think the air is sweet. I know not what I am. I am Chameleon Street. Autumn 1978. Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman is out, Mork and Mindy are in. Platform shoes and 8-track audio tapes are out. Weddings and Walkmans are in. As for my wedding, I got the whole thing on video, you can see it later. As for the Walkman, people ask me all the time, "What are you listening to?" I play the classics. Vivaldi, Hendrix, Debussy. Sly Stone, Sex Pistols, Ipso Facto. It helps relieve the boredom when I'm installing burglar alarms with Curtis. Nice back. You got that good hair, too. You like what? I like girls with that light complexion look. You're a moron. I can't help it. What, being a moron? Yeah, that too. You're the first one out there with a dashiki talking that crap. CURTIS: I'm a victim. STREET: Good hair... STREET: Nigga, you so brainwashed. - I'm a victim, brother. - That's your problem. STREET: A victim. Shit... CURTIS: I'm a victim of 400 years of conditioning. STREET: Shut up. CURTIS: The "man" has programmed my conditioning. Mmm-hmm. Even my conditioning has been conditioned. [Curtis laughs] But you know how eventually conditioned hair will go back to kink. Meaning what? Eventually you're gonna end up dating a dark-skinned girl? I didn't say that. But I would think about it. No, but really man, she is fine. [Street sighs] You depress me. What is taking so long? Why don't you blow the horn? Yeah, right. And the rest of the day, all I'm going to hear is, "Why d'you blow the horn like that when I'm taking care of business?" You know we got somebody new he's gonna hire. What, that white boy? - Rick. Rick. - Oh, great. When you meet him, I hope you don't say: "Hello, white boy." Just say, "Hello, Rick." Hey man, I thought this was an all black thing. CURTIS: So did you all have a honeymoon, man? STREET: Nah, we had a moneymoon. A moneymoon? What's that? STREET: A moneymoon is where instead of getting your own place, and traveling somewhere far away, you stay at my parents' house and travel over to the mall and open charge accounts with Neiman-Marcus, Bonwit-Teller and Saks Fifth Avenue. CURTIS: A moneymoon! [laughs] [car honking] Thanks for making my day. Thank you. - What? - What'd you blow the horn like that for? - What? - Now... - Man, he ain't gonna say nothing. - Yeah, I'll bet. Five dollars say he don't say squat. Bet. You're on. Lay it up. Lay it up. Lay it up. My money's good, punk. That's okay. You're gonna be askin' me for lunch money today, buddy. [Street sighs] I need some money, Curtis. Yeah. Everybody needs money. I need some money. Man, there's lots of ways to make money. You need to start taking advantage of your opportunities. I mean, you could sell your blood. Sell my blood? Right. Eight dollars a pint. Sell my blood? Man... The blood bank! Sell my blood. I'll never get that low. I've done it! Like that's some criteria. You drink Sterno. STREET: Working for my father's burglar alarm company was like earning slave wages in the ninth circle of hell. We spent all our time making cheap bets with chump change. I don't know who was more predictable, the J-O-B or my D-A-D. Here he comes. Why don't you give me the money right now? Watch. [approaching steps] What'd you blow the horn like that for while I'm taking care of business? [bill crinkling] - Thank you. - CURTIS: Yeah, right. STREET: I married Gabrielle in the Spring of 1978 when the dogwood was in blossom. [TV in background] STREET: Speaking about dogs, I'd like you to meet Darlene my first wife. She was the living personification of the question: "Is there life after TV?" [burp] Kiss my ass. STREET: All I said was, "May I have my breakfast now, honey?" Kiss my ass! STREET: This is home video I shot of Gabrielle rehearsing for a stage show put on by Delta Theta Sigma. That's Gabrielle. She's a Georgia peach but we met in North Carolina on Bennett's campus. Gabrielle had fine assets. Assets that Darlene couldn't even begin to approximate. For one thing, she was a reader, and so was I. And sexually, Gabrielle was responsive with a capital 'R'. A girl who reads Gwendolyn Brooks and kisses me like Soulmate #1 deserves to be my significant other. So anyway, the 70s ended with the deadly D's: Divorce from Darlene, Debt and Depression. Two years later, the 80's didn't look much better. Still living at home with my parents, still listening to my brother Darren chew his food too loud. You see, Darren thinks he's a comedian. He's about as funny as the last scream for help at Armageddon. Stop chewing so loud. Now you see, I asked him very politely not to chew his food too loud. Listen. [loud chewing noises] Get a job at a gas station. Shut up, man. I'm gonna sneeze! [laughs] Very funny. [children playing outside] [laughs] STREET: But as different as they were, both Gabrielle and Darlene sent me to work every morning with the same message: - Make some money. - What? Make some money. Okay. [train clacking on tracks] [van screeching to a halt] Hey, you guys, this should be a gas. We've got seven rooms in here to wire. RICK: Pretty cool STREET: A gas. C'mon, Curtis. CURTIS: Great. All the white boys in the world, and your Daddy has to pick the most happiest. RICK: Hey, the door, man. [door slams] This is boring. This is boring! MAN: Throw your dollars down here. [glass put down hard on table] STREET: Shit! MAN: Yup. That's my money. You're gonna owe me four more dollars. [loud laugh] MAN: Give me some money. STREET: What a minute, let me try it again. CURTIS: C'mon, man. MAN: Double or nothing. CURTIS: $10 man, c'mon. MAN: Double or nothing, here. CURTIS: Set it up. MAN: There's five, right there. Just get your four dollars out. C'mon, c'mon, you can do it, baby. It's your world, it's your world baby c'mon, c'mon. Get me five more dollars together, y'all. C'mon baby, you can do it, you can do it! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Alright! [cheers] STREET: In those days, home away from home was right here, at the Trio. We'd sit around and discuss all the things dissatisfied brothers would discuss, mainly money. [ringing of cash register] Sam has a better understanding of computers than I do. - Cause you got a computer, right? - I got a calculator. - [Curtis snorts] - Oh, shut up, Curtis. It's really very simple, man. Well, why haven't you done it then? - Because I don't have a job. - But we all know that. This'll work man, it's got to work. Okay. They send the checks to a clearinghouse. Check the checks to make sure that they check. - Yeah? - Yeah. What do you mean, check the checks? Sounds like a nursery rhyme. Wait, wait. So when you put that little pinhole prick in there, you know they have to be sorted electronically, right? Right. Those optical characters at the bottom of the check. You put a little pinhole prick in there, the computer can't read it. So it kicks it back out. SAM: A pinhole-prick, right? Pinhole-prick. Yes. - Yeah? - It's really basic. - Yeah? - Just like you. Simple. Have you done it before? For the past three years. SAM: You said that last time. Been working like a charm. Then why you wearing those clothes? - And how come you ain't got no money? - This is my brother's coat. Why don't you buy some beer? - CURTIS: Why don't you buy everybody... - It's your turn. [train clacking across tracks] Man, we need some money. [train clacking across tracks] [package landing on table] A kilo of weed of month, okay? You get rid of thirty ounces. That'll be $300. You take 125 right off the top. That's yours. Plus... plus... you can nickel and dime, man, you can nickel and dime any miscellaneous buds you may have. All that is pure profit for you too. One thing, though. Keep in mind that this is strictly business, okay? You come to me, you say you wanna make some money. This is it. This is your chance. The question is, what do you want to do? STREET: I don't know. I mean, thinking from a theoretical point of view, the question is, do I have to deal drugs in order to make money? Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Look... Do you want to philosophize about this brother? Huh? Or do you want to make some money. Make some money. Mon-ey. STREET: I had met Detroit Tiger Willie Horton socially and he'd been very nice to me. My ex-high school associates wanted to make use of the connection. For how much? 20. 25.000. SAM: [laughs] You all are talking stupid. Now you, I can understand. But Errol, how you get so stupid? Duhh... I take stupid pills. [cackling laugh] SAM: You can write the company back and tell them they work, stupid. Can't write. Too stupid! [laughs] STREET: Twenty... five... thousand... dollars. $50.000. They got the money. - You know they got it. - You know they got the money. STREET: And... who's gonna write the note? ERROLL: A-hem. [exhales] SAM: You can count me out. CURTIS: You're the one with the words, bro. That's right. You know my spellin' be off sometimes. STREET: You know how to spell extortion? - Yeah, why? - Can you do it, is the question. C'mon Get a paper for this, man. C'mon. I'll even drive you up there. SAM: Drive. Use your car, Sam. [door closing] C'mon. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. - Let's go! - Let's go! [car backfires] [tires screech] No, let's just stay here. [engine tries to turn over] Relax. Let's just camp out here. [engine keeps trying to turn over] STREET: To this very day, people ask me why I did I send a copy of the letter to the Detroit Free Press and the Flint Journal for publication. Dear Mrs. Horton, We have some photographs of your husband doing acts with several different women. We will not release this to the press if you pay $50.000 to us, before banking hours close today. Go with this man and give him the money and nothing will happen. Signed, Doug Street. STREET: Okay, first of all, I had nothing to do with the note appearing in the Detroit Free Press of the Flint Journal. It was Curtis. Or should I say, "Judas." CURTIS: That's right. It was a publicity move. I signed Doug's name and I was going to sign mine, but I thought it was more effective coming from one person, you know? STREET: The press adopted me as a kind of media mascot for a few days. REPORTER: How does you wife feel about your escapades? [knowing laughter among reporters] I haven't talked to her yet. No you haven't. STREET: Gabrielle was not pleased. [reporters' overlapping questions] But I was getting into it. After that letter to the Free Press, I leaked to the media and that the whole extortion thing was a means to an end, that what I really wanted all along was a tryout with the Detroit Tigers. I was even interviewed by the Barber twins, Denny and Dave. Denny covered sports for Channel 59, while brother Dave's Open Forum on Channel 4 handled the big issues. From all the reports, you certainly seemed to impress the Tigers. Have you heard from the front office? Anybody in Tiger management been in touch with you? - You mean about a tryout? - A tryout, a real tryout. Uh, no, no, not yet. - Do you think maybe they will? - Uh, no, no, not really. Well, I'll tell you what Doug Street, you've certainly got a lot of moxie and I hope things definitely work out for you. - Moxie? - Moxie. - What's that? - I, I don't know. My producer gave me the word and I just tried to slip it into the the program. Is that like having garlic on your breath? I'll tell you what, anybody that could pull off a stunt like this obviously has a lot of determination and drive, and I think they deserve a chance. This has been the Barber Beat. [cheesy theme music] Whoo! Boy. The seat got hot. You know, Willie Horton? Personally, and I know him to be a very understanding individual. Let's get another record straight while we're talking about Mr. Horton. You never had photographs, Polaroid photographs of Willie Horton with girls, did you? To get the record straight, that record... Did you? I beg your pardon? You never had Polaroid pictures of Willie Horton with girls, did you? No, no. In fact, had you ever witnessed Willie Horton cavorting with other women? - No, no. - Then why? Please tell me why would you concoct such a licentious, lowdown, loathsome lie? My objective... My objective was to... present Mrs. Horton, while her husband was away with something that was so wrenching that she would be panicked. I wanted to press her panic button. Then why... This is not a big expose you're doing, this is all a matter of public record. Answer this question. Why? - Why, what? - Would you concoct... I wanted to get the money. Money! Man, we need some money. For the money. You're a liar, aren't you, Mr Street? [uncomfortable cough] STREET: When I got home that night, I found out that Gabrielle had the real Evening News. I'm pregnant. STREET: The Willie Horton fiasco changed my life. It would have changed even more if they'd pressed charges. You know, if it hadn't been for Curtis, my first escapade would have gotten over. I decided to try the sports world again, but this time as a reporter. From Time. I had all her personal statistics in the first 10 minutes. Height, 6'2". Weight, 165. Feet, 13. IQ, 178. She and her twin sister Pam had already carved a place for themselves in women's basketball. They'd gone to the Olympics, been on the cover of Jet, and the collection of Paula's poetry was about to be published. The way I figured it, an interview with Paula McGee could be sold to Time magazine for $2.000. She was brimming over with the four B's. Black, Brains, Beauty, Basketball. All in one delectable, 6-foot 2-inch package. Oh Lord I could just rap to her like Barry White? [Barry White music] [Street imitating Barry White]: Oh, Paula, let me pull on your pink panties. And baby, your pert pagodas perched like two firm pears in my fruit salad. Got that maraschino cherry, baby. They peek at me so prettily from underneath your polyester Givenchy. I began to suddenly steer the conversation into her personal life. Of course, the key word is subtle. Have you ever had an orgasm? What's that have to do with the cover story? Well, you know, the big picture. Oh, oh well, it's funny you should bring that up because just the other day I was talking to a friend of mine about how women fake orgasms, and I think that's crazy. Yeah. I love the haiku form. It's so... pure. STREET: Paula had told her secretary Melissa to hold all appointments. This one's called, "Feet." Your feet stink, your mind is rank, I hate the way, you're shaped like a tank. What do you think? Mmnh. Maybe you should stop the tape? Why? Because I don't want to sound like I'm desperate, because I'm not. - [laughs] Maybe you are. - No. Even though I don't go on the "Love Connection." That date... that TV dating game show? Yeah. But then I said if I go on the show, and I say the reason I'm here basically is because I don't have anybody to date, then it looks like I'm desperate. - No, it doesn't. - Yes. It does. I eat chitlins. The chitlins eat me. Get me a stomach pump. So what do you think? STREET: I don't believe this. Here she is with the world at her feet, and she can't find a decent guy to date? Un-hunh, something's wrong. After three hours I begin to fantasize about this extraordinary woman. In another age, she would have been a warrior goddess, an African amazon. Go on and Serengeti me, baby. [telephone rings] I got something I need you to see. I need you to come out here. Right? Paula excused herself and I sat there and sat there and sat there, blowing smoke rings. I had misspelled the word "write," and whatchamacallher, Melissa, who wrote such dumbass poetry, she was smart enough to call Time headquarters and ask for a personnel confirmation. When I married you, I didn't think you were stupid. I can't stand stupid men. I can't stand stupid people, period. Only a moron would send a letter with the misspelling like that. Did you watch your soap operas today? And see, you're cutting into my soap time and I don't allow that. - Which one did you want? - Which do you think? Erica, of course. - Susan Lucci, Susan Lucci! - "Susan Lucci, Susan Lucci." I don't know why you waste your time watching that stuff. Well, they make about as much sense as telling people one lie after another. I took her to a restaurant so she would stop pouting. Babe loves to pout. She's the Pouting Princess. - [garbled] I hate asparagus... - What? I said I hate asparagus - that tastes like leather. - You just don't like vegetables. - That's not true. I married you. - And I married you, Mr. Potatohead. - You know, honey? - Mmh? I've been thinking you could enroll at the University of Michigan and study medicine. Hm you've been thinking, that's dangerous. You'd like to be a doctor's wife, wouldn't you? Yes, you take care of the patients and then I'll take care of the pennies. What pennies? Neiman-Marcus takes care of all our pennies. - Or Bonwit-Teller. - Yes or Saks 5th Avenue. You want another beer? No, I'm fine. You are extremely fine and you know it too, don't you? [kissing sound] [burp] Ah, excuse me, Miss? I would like another Michelob Light. And... you want anything else? Yes. Two pieces of pecan pie, please. Two? Will there be anything else? She also wants one lifetime charge account at Lane Bryant. Yes, thank you. I thought you were gonna watch your figure. I am. Watch it get big. You know when you really think about it, you're the one responsible for my overeating. - What? - You put me under a lot of strain with what you've been doing. Mmh, well, you know if I'd wanted to marry a big, fat, greasy, chocolate, donut-eating, Hostess Cupcake Twinkie lard-elbowed woman, I could have married Joy. If I ever got that big, there's just - more of me to love. - More of me to love. - Alright. - Well? Baby, I would divorce you so quick your head would spin. - You wouldn't. - Mhm-hnh. Would you really? Well, why don't you put on 50 pounds and find out? You're awful. I live and learn. One Michelob Light, and two pieces of the pecan pie. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Excuse me. But I was just sitting over there admiring your dress. Thank you. It's nice to see some class in this dump. Don't you know Michelob is for white man? And you know that the white man runs this world? Is that what it says on the label? - How much? - How much what? "How much what?" Come on. Cut the comedy. Bitch is fine. And I'm willing to pay through the nose when the ass has got class. Hot honey, come on, take a drink here, come on. You know what I mean? Porch monkey? You did say "more funky." That is what he said, isn't it? "More funky?" Not porch monkey, more funky. Hey! What don't you get around... okay? What are you, crazy? Nigger. Get your nasty black hands off of me. He thinks he can just like come in here and– Fucking let go! [gasp] You know that's a very nasty word, but what's really, pardon the expression, fucked up, is your grammar. "Fucking let go." You can't say that. You know, the rules of grammar apply to profanity as well. The word "fuck" comes from the German root, "ficken," which means to strike. It's a verb and can be used in a variety of ways, both transitive and intransitive. For example, simple aggression. "Fuck you!" Or simple confusion. "What the fuck is going on here?" And then there's apathy. "Who gives a fuck?" And then there's ignorance, which is very appropriate for you. "Doh!" Marty. Call the police. I can deal with this asshole! Yeah yeah, sure, defiance, "the fuck you can." I ain't gonna take this shit from you! Authority! "Shut the fuck up." And you can say it four different ways: "shut the fuck up," "shut the fuck up," "shut the fuck up," "shut the fuck up." See these are all the things you could have said if you weren't so unbelievably coarse and crude and countrified. That's alliteration, babe. And remember, peckerwood. Profanity is the last refuge of the ignorant, the insensitive and the illiterate. But if you're going to use it, and I can see you are at least get the fucking grammar right, moron. [smack] [crowd gasp] [fist hit] MAN: Let's see your muscles instead of your mouth. Come on boy! Get up! STREET: Instant replay. Dumb broad asked me the other day, "why didn't you punch out that peckerwood?" I said: "Because I was unconscious, you extremely stupid bitch." [train clacking on tracks] I had so many bruises on my face, for my next role, I had to use a little bit of makeup. Gabriel drove me to the hospital and it was in the hospital that one of my ideas was pushed over the edge. Let me be perfectly honest with you. Your credentials are just too amazing to believe. You know this is the first time we've ever had an intern transfer here from Harvard Med. It's quite an honor. I considered Harvard myself. Listen. Why don't I explain how the transitional internship works? Then we can give you a little tour of the hospital. You can meet some of the other residents and see what you think. Yeah, that sounds fine. I'll just finish this. There. Doctor Street, I'd like for you to meet Doctor Doris McCully. How do you do? I was really amazed at the way doctors are treated. Everybody is always glad to see you. Everybody always listens to every word and best of all, everybody laughs at your jokes. The intern knows all but does nothing. Now the surgeon knows nothing, but does it all. And the pathologist knows everything. But it's too late. [laughter] RESIDENT: T-max was 102.4 degrees last night. Alright, let's keep an eye on that temp today and get that ultrasound done this morning. She could have anything from hepatitis to a hot gallbladder. [hospital loudspeaker paging doctor] Have the surgeons felt her belly yet? No, in fact, they haven't consulted anyone. ER admitted her directly to the floor this morning, 'cause she's one of Doctor Callis' private patients. DOCTOR: Fine, I'll talk to Callis. In the meantime, let's get some information on this one. Alright, that's it. Let's go get some breakfast. [organ music] It was too easy. It was too easy. Maybe you're asking yourself, "Well, how could he continue to operate in Detroit after he'd been exposed on TV and all?" Answer's very simple. People forget. Of course, your wife ain't exactly "people," and my relationship now with Gabrielle was an intricate cobweb of lies. You mess with one, they all jiggle. She believed I was a bona fide student of medicine enrolled at Wayne State. She loved me and where love leads, belief must follow. After all, we've got to believe the ones we love. Let's send Mrs. Crawford down for a chest X-ray this morning. And... an AP and a lateral. - Okay, got it. - Okay? Mmh, let me see. - Doctor Street, are you on call today? - That's right, it's me. Good. Could you look at Robertson in 41? She's complaining of some chest pain. Oh. - Yes, yes, I... I'll, I'll be right there. - Oh, would you like a stat EKG? Mnh, yes. Yeah, I'll take a stat EKG and... right away. [suspenseful percussive music] You had the whole gang today. - You have a lovely family. - Thank you. Doctor Street. Here's the EKG. Looks like Mrs. Robertson is in normal sinus rhythm. Mnh-hnh. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Now, Mrs. Robertson. - Tell me exactly where the pain is. - Right here, Doctor. - Right there. - Yeah. [murmurs] And have you ever felt this kind of pain before? No, never. Came on rather sudden. Rather sudden? Feels like someone put a knife in there or something. - Feels like someone put a knife in you? - Yes. Mmnh. [Velcro detaching] Let's just... Hmmh. [heartbeats] Now take a deep breath. Ahhh! Lord, woman, what's wrong with you? Doctor, it hurts. [Moans] That hurt, doctor. Do you see a dysrhythmia on the EKG, Dr. Street? Ah... Yeah. Yeah, you mean this EKG here, right? Yeah. Yeah. It could be abnormal. Apparently, the key word here was oxygen, which I ordered for Mrs. Robertson at the last minute, and as Doctor Hardy expressed to me the next day over coffee, I was doing a very thorough and professional job. [train clacking on tracks] I think I'll stop by just to see how a Harvard man works. You know there's a rumor circulating around here that when a Harvard man makes his first incision, he doesn't use a scalpel, he just orders the flesh to part and it parts like Moses and the Red Sea. I'll see you in O.R., 45 minutes. You've got a hysterectomy to perform. STREET'S TRAIN CONDUCTOR VOICE: All aboard to Hysterectomy passing through Flesh, Muscle, Organ, non-stop to Uterus. All aboard. STREET: I had visualized myself performing surgery many times, but of course, there's nothing ever quite like the real thing. I don't know if any of you sitting out there have ever cut a human being open before with two interns, three nurses and the resident physician looking over your shoulder, but you can take my word for it, it's an unforgettable experience. And people ask me if I regret what happened. Sure, I regret it. 06:00h. I begin to notice odd details. I like her belly button. I've always felt that innies are infinitely superior to outties, but on the other hand, her stretch marks gross me out. - STREET: Can we begin? - RESIDENT: Ready. STREET: Scalpel. DOCTOR: Wilson. Brady. I want you to note the speed and dexterity of Doctor Street's work. STREET: Oh, speed and dexterity. What time are they going to show up? STREET: Open. I can't believe the amount of blood in this woman. Doctor Street has filled me in on the latest gospel on glove wearing according to the powers that be at Harvard. Apparently they've discovered that surgical gloves are more effective if they're worn two sizes smaller. - DOCTOR: Can I have the Hemostat? - STREET: Hemostat. DOCTOR: Tie? STREET: Tie, tie. Why is this nurse breathing so hard? She's freaking me out. Either she can tell I don't know what I'm doing or the sight of blood makes her sick. STREET: Wipe. Wipe. STREET: 06:20 and counting. God, I'm drowning in my own sweat. I can't tell what Doctor Hardy's thinking. Sometimes he looks puzzled. STREET: Big refractor. Sometimes he looks furious. And sometimes he just gives me a cold stare. Oh Lord, I hope this sweat doesn't make my mascara run. Be looking like some kind of punk doctor. Wipe me. Alright. Now. [gasps] - STREET: METS. - [DOCTOR]:Suture scissors. DOCTOR: Alright. Let's close. Street? Why don't you help Wilson and Brady close. STREET: Certainly. And Street, after the patient is in the recovery room, I want to see you in my office. Immediately. Jane, before I suture this patient, please give me size 6 1/2 gloves. I hardly know what to say. This is really quite unexpected. But I have never seen a resident at your level demonstrates that surgical savoir faire. All I need now are some fuchsia pots. I'll go out and buy some. [knocking on door] Don't answer it. Why not? Two guys came about an hour ago. I think that's them. I think that is they. When are you going to learn how to speak English? STREET: Don't worry. [knocking on door] - Wait a minute. - Doug? What? GABRIELLE: You know if it's the police, I've got to tell them the truth. Who said it was the police? Then why are we whispering? You're not whispering. Not soft enough. - How do you do? - Fine, thank you. Are you Mrs. Street, married to Dr. Douglas Street? - Yes I am. - We'd like to talk to the doctor. - Is he home? - Yes, he is. Do you mind if we look around? STREET: A random security check at the hospital had revealed my true identity. State police had persuaded the young lady I'd operated on to press charges. Fraud with malicious intent. You can go to jail for that. [prison bell] [thwack] [cell door slamming shut] STREET: I don't know about the rest of these convicts, but I didn't come to prison. I come to study. - Have you actually...? - [gasp of surprise] Sorry about that. I've been wanting to ask you. Do you actually read all those books? Yes. You know what puts the frosting on the cake? - Hunh-unh. - I understand them. That's Eugene. Eugene and I both shared a mutual admiration for Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, so we'd get together and trade comics talk comics, remember comics. In fact, Eugene was in Jackson because of comics. He beat on his mother until she died, because, well, let him tell it. So when I get home and go up to my room, I say, "Mom. What hath become of my comic books?" I used to always talk like Thor. - Yeah? - Yeah. [Street laughs] You used to always talk like Thor, huh? Yeah, I patterned my speech after him. Yeah. Sometimes I talk like Spider-Man. - Or Daredevil. Or Nick Fury. - Yeah. Or the Hulk. Of course the Hulk really didn't have too much to say. No. Not really. Here you go, man. [food plopping on tray] -Thanks, -That's right. Hey brother, you better wake up. You sleepwalking? No man, this food is tripping me out. Look. Watermelon is slimy. Maybe we should stop pressing license plates and use these for... [smashing on table] bricks. [scoffs] You don't like the rolls we bake? - When do you bake 'em? - 4:30 in the morning. Get a little hard around supper time. A little hard? [laughs] You have a gift for understatement. [laughs] Got some for you Street. [sound of catching roll] - What's this? - Hot. - Hey! - No, we use flour. [chuckles] Okay. Well listen, how much do I owe you? It's cool. STREET: I guess because he was Chief Cook, Smooth got a few extra perks. TV, stereo, hot plate, and the power to invite a few guests over after hours. He has access to the best Thai stick in Jackson prison. -GUARD: Come on Street, -One of the guards, Larry Thompson. He'd take you back to Smooth's cell after lights out. Come on here, man! [warm laugh] How's it been going? You ready to finish that game or you scared? - Go on and sit on the beat! - Alright. My Mama sent me some cookies. Like chocolate chip? How did you know? Hey. Wendell, where are you? Wendell? [screams] His eyes were boiling with hatred. I told you not to play with me. [Western movie shooting] I didn't mean it. [crowd roar] Come on. Steve! You know... I've been real nice to you, ain't I? Yeah man. And I appreciate it, too. [karate kick yell] Strange things happen here at night. [nocturnal howling] Pass me that spud, will you? [TV]: Please don't do it! [woman screams] WOMAN ON TV: I said, "please." Yeah, thanks, that's enough. TV: [Howling and cat screeching] Yeah, I've been real nice to you. You ain't been nice to me. Hmm? What do you mean? You know what I mean. - Uh-oh. - You ain't crazy. - [cough] - Say what? Yeah, yeah man. Like I'll be looking out for you, you know? Mmh-hmm. You know how you can look out for me, don't you? I could smell his genitalia as it wafted across the cell. You don't even know me, so put your pants back on. Just put your pants back on. I can get to know you. I ain't even like that. You're doing it with whatchamacallit. That white boy I see you hanging out with. - Aldo? - That's right. [scoffs] You doing it. What's the matter you color-struck? Saving it for all the white boys, huh? Why don't you get your mind out of the gutter? You know, I've been real nice to you, Doug. You know what goes down. Not me. I don't go down. I don't have to be nice. [Street laughs] What are you gonna do? Stop bringing me hot rolls in the morning? No, look. Here you take this joint back. And you keep that joint under wraps and you cancel my order for smooth, soft, steamy succulent, accent-on-the-sucked breakfast buns and I'll see you later. I'm gonna get out of here. Where you think you going? - Hey, hey... - I can take it if I want it and I want it. Un-hunh. Don't touch me man. Mnh-mnh. Don't... touch... me. What's wrong with you? Mmm... Oh God. Man. What the hell's the matter with you? I got a nervous... A nervous disorder and it has to do with my blood pressure. It's alright, I got it. - You got it. - Mnh-mnh. Hey, Thompson! Hey! Thompson. [garbled] I...got...a nervous condition. Nerve... nerve.. Nerve... nerve nerve... nervous... condition. You epilepsy? Oh no, man no. It's alright. I got... They say that I should be on medication, but I don't like pills so... [Street moans] It's alright. - What time is it? - 8:30, uh... Time for you to go. STREET: Smooth's philosophy was if you can't lick him, suck him, whereas the way I see it, if you can't suck him, trick him. Because of the trick epileptic I was sent straight to the Big House psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Hand. This is all just a vacation to you, isn't it? Prison? A vacation? To you, yes, it's all part of your grand design. My grand design. - You laugh. - You funny. Does it say in your folder there what my grand design is? Have you got the blueprints? Has anyone ever told you your sense of sarcasm is extremely strong? Oh yeah. Has anyone ever told you that white people who get caught in the rain smell exactly like wet dogs? This is fact, believe it or not. I beg your pardon. Where the... I know, I know, I know. But look, have you ever been standing in a crowd of white people, and all of a sudden it starts to rain. It's a very particular odor, extremely aromatic. Mnnnh. You like to use humor as a smokescreen. Look. I'm so far ahead of you. I know what you're about to say. I know what you're thinking. I know what you're writing on those evaluation papers. I know that you're wearing an incredibly cheap toupee. I mean, I could sit here and punch all the right buttons and make you think you're a genius for correctly analyzing this complex, exotic, notorious Negro, but... Notorious negro... That would be a good name for my autobiography. I started writing my life story. No... notorious... The first time I went to Jackson Prison I was there for nine months. Mom. Give me the phone. Mom? And don't call here anymore. Mom? And that's the way to handle it. But anyway, you're not so far off, you know. You know, I give people what they want. When I meet somebody I know within the first two minutes who they want me to be. And I just cut the emotional cloth of my personality to fit the emotional clothing of whomever I'm... Conning. DR. HAND: Why are you smiling? STREET: Now you see it, now you don't. WARDEN: We have a very good rapport with all of our inmates here. STREET: The warden walked through with a group of civilians. Will you look at this brother here? He's so busy protecting the white woman. He can't even be bothered with my escape. It's freezing out here. I mean, I was at Yale. It's not too far away. I got $24. I can get a bus in Ypsilanti. [train clacking across tracks] The first thing I did after arriving in New Haven, Connecticut was get to Yale campus. Second thing, get a collegiate Buppy haircut. Third thing, get Gabrielle on the phone. STREET: What? Don't ask stupid questions... I can't come back because the Ann Arbor Police are asking me for that non-petition funds check and I can't report to my parole officer because she'll lock me up. GABRIELLE: I can't be a part of this anymore. I don't believe it. STREET: What? GABRIELLE: I don't believe you're in your right mind, Doug. STREET: What did you say? Would you put your mouth to the phone and talk louder? GABRIELLE: And even if you are. I'd have to be out of my mind to get involved. STREET: While I was in prison, Gabrielle had become a Jehovah's Witness. Said she was tired of being a Baptist. Now how can anybody be tired of being a Baptist? Lord have mercy. Well, we don't see eye-to-eye or God-to-God. That afternoon I went to Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast. To help get my mind right. BEAST: Alors! STREET: I love that movie. BEAST: Alors, cher monsieur. Vous volez mes roses. Vous volez mes roses. STREET: After the movie I spend seven minutes persuading Harkness Hall to let me have a room even though I don't have my ID card. Next morning I knew what I had to do and I was geek to do it. Stopped by Goodwill. Bought an $11 corduroy suit with patches... "I'm depending on you, son." - Can you tell me where Harkness Hall is? - Yeah, it's right over there. His name: Richard Dukes. And he was made to order for my ID. Hey, some of your tapes fell on the ground. Duh! Next morning, 8:00 a.m. Registrar. - Okay, that's "Richards?" - Richard, Richard. - Dukes. - Dukes. - D-U-K-E-S. - Alright, Richard. Left a note for Amina Tatiana in her mailbox. We haven't seen each other for five years, not since I split. Thanks to Dick's ID, I now have total access to the university's facilities, including the library here. But it won't be long before the registrar gets hip to this game. I've got to get another identity, quick. [ceremonial organ music] Walking into the library. Like walking into a cathedral. I approached the librarian. STREET: Excuse me, miss. I always feel right at home in a library. Well, who have we here? Jason Goes to Yale? I love the atmosphere in a library. You can almost hear the sound of thought. Can you hear it? And at the moment, all of my thinking is headed in a bilingual direction. [continued organ music] STREET: "Do you sweat much at night?" "Transpirez-vous beacoup pendant la nuit?" "I shave my armpit every day." "Je me rase mon aisselle tous les jours." "Your friend is a real slut. She gets laid by everyone." "Ta copine est une vraie poupiasse. Elle se fait sauter par tout le monde." "par tout le monde." "par tout le monde." MAN: Excuse me sir, there's no smoking in the lounge. [FRENCH ACCENT]: But I have been smoking here for the past two hours. MAN: The people upstairs say bring the ashtray downstairs, sir. There's no smoking in the lounge, as a matter of fact, I'm taking that ashtray. Merde. MAN: I beg your pardon? - Merde to you. - What do that mean, sir. Merde means merde. Yeah. Uh no, they invited me to this masquerade ball next week. Yeah, it's a costume ball, and whoever has the best costume gets $10.000 prize money. Shoot. Gabrielle act like she's sorry I called. I am sorry, too. But when I get back to my room, Amina Tatiana is waiting. And she wasn't sorry either. Amina was from Kenya, from money, from beauty and class. I was from hunger, but she loved and excited me in a way no other woman has before or since. You look incredibly beautiful. You look incredibly beautiful. Tiara. Tiara. [romantic guitar music] Anyway, I just froze. You know, the only thing I could think of was, you know the skunk in the Warner Brothers cartoon, Pepe Le Pew. Mmh-hnh. That's all I could think of and I just said "Pepe." You know, if I were little bit stronger in French, if I spoke as many languages as you do, you know that's what I wish. Then I could really get it. STREET: Anyway, do you know who this is? TIANA: No, I don't think so. STREET: Édith Piaf. I taped it off PBS. [speaking French] I don't know what the hell she's talking about, but I got the words and inflections down. So, I decided to show up at one of these orientation parties. - STUDENT: McLuhan. - What? It was a good test. MAN: whose said many a times it's a wasteland. TV is a vast wasteland. STREET: I introduced myself as Pepe le Mofo. - TIANA: Who? - STREET: Pepe le Mofo. I told them I was a foreign exchange student from Martinique. I didn't have the Piaf completely memorized, but I figured if I got lost in conversation I could always start accusing people. [laughs] TIANA: Oh, I see. My faculty advisor, Mr Shaw, he sat me down with a few students who claimed they could speak French. Après moi, le déluge. Après moi, le déluge. Oui. They all thought I was French. [she laughs] They tried to pull out their high school French. STREET: Everything was fine until Raoul walked into the picture. Raoul was a real foreign exchange student from Belgium. Je trouve cette chemise très laide. J'accuse les femmes. J'accuse. J'accuse Jacques Brel. J'accuse Jacques Cousteau. J'accuse Jacques Strap. J'accuse Jacuzzi J'accuse Brigitte Bardot. J'accuse Pierre Salinger. GIRL THINKING: What the hell is he talking about? Je protégeais quelqu'un, hein? Quelqu'un. Après moi. Non? - Oui. - Non. - Oui, non. Oui? - RAOUL: Non. Tu ne parles pas français. How long do you think you can keep this up? This French facade. What are you going to do while you're here? I'm going to crash this costume ball that's being given next week. It's being given in honor of Phantomas Judex. Phantomas Judex? Yeah, Phantomas Judex. - The French rock group. - French rock. Is it anything like French kissing? - STREET: You wanna come? - Oh. I've got 200 pages of material to absorb every night for the next two weeks. But that sounds very interesting. Douglas Street. The Chameleon at a masquerade ball. - Yeah. - I would like to come with you. - Alright! - [she laughs] - Listen, I'm going to come as the Beast. - Excellent. You know, from Beauty and the Beast. - Yes, yes. - The fairy tale? - It's typecasting. - And you... should come as Beauty. Black Beauty. - Black Beauty was a horse. - Mmmm... Black Beauty is... That's more typecasting. Remember that time we were in DC. Oh, there's your earring. Remember that time we were in DC, and those kids met us on the street and they asked you if you were the black Barbie. I remember. - But Doug... - Mmh? Maybe Gabrielle should come with you as Beauty. How did you know I was married? Nancy Bankoff told me since I didn't receive an invitation. Bankoff. Gabrielle wouldn't even get a kick out of it. She'd probably say it was against her religion to attend a masquerade ball. What do you mean? Look. There's a lot you don't know. TIANA: Do you love her? I... I heard a great quote the other day. Woman inspires man to create masterpieces, and then prevents him from carrying them out. - Who said that? - Oscar Wilde. Maybe... Divine Oscar. She doesn't understand what masterpiece you're trying to create, Doug. I'm not sure anybody understands what you're doing. Least of all you. Hey, if I didn't know what I was doing, I couldn't do what I am doing. True, but that still doesn't explain what it is you want. I want... If all of my dreams of beauty had been crazy-glued together into one perfect woman, she would have been like you. Perfect. Would you listen to what I'm saying? Don't you know that all my life I've been going out trying to find out what this "love" is about? - You're married. - That's what divorce is for. Oh no. To help you come up with a definition of love? Doug, that's like using abortion as contraception. You know you're gonna be a very good attorney. But could you, like, put down the law books for a minute? Why don't you try and talk about what we can do in order to stay together? Why don't you talk about that? - Oh Doug. - Don't... That's what I want. More than anything in the world. Mmh-unh? But in my heart, I know it will never happen now. Mnh. I know. [guillotine smashes down] [thumping synth rock music] [continued party music] STREET: This whole event is being covered by cable. Look across the ballroom. See that huge projection of David's masterpiece "Marat Assassinated"? The band members have all taken famous names from the French Revolution. The one who calls himself Robespierre, that's him. He keeps encouraging the crowd to chant, "Marat! Marat!!" Like Marat was some kind of hero. These people don't even know they're cheering a psychotic! Long live lemmings! SINGER: Woo! STREET (as BEAST): Belle. Je vous aime, Belle. STREET: Garçon! Yes, Sir. I need a straw to drink the champagne. Oui? Need a straw. - I will see what I can do. - Merci beaucoup. Va. Accélerez, va. - Vas-tu! - [responds in bad French] Va, va, va. STREET: Merci! Merci! Merci très bien! What'd they say? - How much did you give him? - Five cents. I'm cheap, but I have class. What did he say? Roughly translated, and I quote: "You skinflint. You can take that straw and go suck lukewarm cat's piss, you transvestite." Unquote. Well, I wish I could speak French like that. An old fag. [growls] STREET: The guy who helped me with my costume and makeup also ran lights up in the security booth, Jack Pierce. He let us kick back there for awhile. Comb my face, baby. [growling purr] Good. [more purr-growling] - Open your mouth! - Ah! My what long fangs you've got. The better to gnaw you with, my dear. And a lot of fillings, too. [swallowing] More, more! And try to get it in my mouth, next time. I'm trying. Un-hunh. Wha... Mmnh. Ah. Mmnh. Ah. I'm happy. Oh my God. - Uh-oh. Minute's up. - What? Happiness flies when Gabrielle arrives. Gabrielle? - That's Gabrielle? - Gabrielle. [ambient crowd noise over video] Do you think she'll recognize you? I'm going to find out. STREET: I abandoned Amina. I haven't seen or heard from her since. But I still see that look. I still see that face. She doesn't recognize me. Or does she? [classical waltz music] By the time the dance was over, I could tell she didn't know who I was. Enchanté yourself, Belle. My name is Gabrielle Street. What's yours? EMCEE: Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? The time has come to announce our winner! And the winner is: Douglas Street for his costume of the Beast and Amina Tatiana for her costume as Beauty. Doug won! Where is he? My husband won first prize! [crowd applauds] Amina Tatiana? Who's Amina Tatiana? Doug! Doug, is that you? [enthusiastic applause] [distorted, slow-motion roar] STREET: I don't know you and I know you don't know me, so let's agree to disagree if you want. But as far as I'm concerned, most people have maybe two or three great moments in their entire lives. So get it right. If the moment calls, give me the phone. If the moment drops by tonight, show him in. Make him comfortable. Set him up in the easy chair, give him a cup of coffee because I am definitely into the moment. [wild applause and cheering] [eerie music on top of applause] [wicked laughter] [piercing siren-like singing] He told me, "I didn't sleep with Amina." I told him that's a lie. I can see by the way your nose is flaring, you're a liar. STREET: I agreed to nine months of marriage counseling. Gabrielle got a few things off her chest, Bastard. Answer me. Answer me. Do I love her? Do I love her? Do I love her? There are men coming up to me all the time. They offer me everything. Clothes, trips, jewelry. She never cheated on me. - And she could have. Time... - And time... - and time... again. - Again. That hurt me so bad. Don't get me wrong because I love my daughter very much. It just hurt me when... she had the baby like that because I wasn't ready. I know I wasn't ready, I said then I wasn't ready. And she's gonna make me be ready by having the baby behind my back? They say marriages break down in bed first. Ours didn't. After we were married, we went to visit my aunt in Burbank, California, and we went on Newlywed Game. We couldn't keep our hands off each other for the whole show. That's just the way we are. I think our sex life is really outstanding. Even though he does have this little problem with... premature ejaculation. STREET: Diarrhea of the mouth. [key turning in lock] [Street chuckles] You know I got three little letters that'll solve all your problems. A.D.C. You hurt my feelings. That's what they're for. You damn bastard! You no good asshole! I don't believe you! [slapping] Are you through? What, are you through? You don't have to go to the gym today. You just worked out. [door opening] [door slamming against wall] STREET: Play 509 and box it. I need more toys. I need more toys! Hi, Doug. Afecrihalu. Astou-sayn. Astou-sayn. Astou-sayn. [spraying] [spraying] There you go. New toy. Black Barbie. [upbeat music on walkman] Happy now? STREET: Gabrielle insisted that my work with the Detroit Human Rights Commission earned me a six-figure salary. That's ridiculous. It was volunteer work. Would I go to a blood bank every Tuesday and Friday if I had big bucks? CURTIS: I mean, you can sell your blood. $8 a pint. I've done it. STREET: I'll never get that low. I'll never get that low. I'll never get that low. - Well did you get it? - What do you think? - Nope. - Nope. Yeah, 45, 50. - That was good work last night, Doug. - Thank you very much. STREET: Let me introduce my new associates. That's Brian Whitaker, scholar and a gentleman. Brian tried to help me out in the end. RODDY: Vitamin C goes out when you pee. That was the voice of Roddy Pettigrew, in whom both the ass and the hole meet in perfect union. Vitamin E makes me sexy. Take a lot of those. A lot. But that doesn't necessarily mean we're going to win this case. STREET: Mr. Marshall himself. They're sending over four corporate attorneys to meet with you to discuss their client's position. Tomorrow at 10:30. You're gonna enjoy this one, Doug. STREET: Mmh. Is that a promise or a threat? - Mr. Street? - Speak on it, Mary. - Your 10:30 appointment has arrived. - Oh, is that so. - Yes, they are here. - Well, that's fine. Take them into the conference room, give them some coffee, put out the peacock tongue dip and the gefilte fish. Follow me gentlemen. - [knock on door] - Yeah? How long are you going to keep these men waiting? Five more minutes. - They've already been waiting. - Five minutes, that's right. Another five minutes will make it– Ten. That's right, Mary, can't fool you. [instrumental music] - To an amicable settlement. - [MEN AT TABLE]: Toast. Cheers. [glasses clink] [Chopin on piano] STREET: Everything I did at this luncheon was calculated to give me the psychological edge. They each ordered at least two drinks. I ordered, but I didn't drink. The Chopin lulled them, while the alcohol dulled them. [men consult with each other on menu] [Chopin music] I'll have the beef steak tartar. WAITER: Would you care for anything to drink, Sir? OTHER MAN: Um, [indistinct]. STREET: Meanwhile, I quickly analyze my opposition. That's Barrett on the right. He's the head honcho. Made it to the top and he's still dissatisfied. He's got an ulcer, which is why he went to the bathroom about four times. That's Jack Griffin, Barrett's hatchet man. You don't play with him. Oh yeah, this guy. I didn't catch his name. I think they brought this guy along to be a distraction. - Came straight from the dentist. - Is that so? Got my teeth cleaned. MAN: I have to be at the tanning spa tomorrow morning at 6. Is that so? - Did you say the tanning spa? - Yes. Which one do you go to? Golden Tones, in Briarwood. Is it very expensive? Yes, actually. If you're interested, I can get you a free guest pass. Oh no. No, I was just doing a little research. - On what? - White people. It amazes me, that whites avidly seek after all the accoutrements of black style. You pickle your bodies in gallons of tanning lotion. You broil your pale flesh brown in the tanning spas at great expense. And all the while maintaining such a marvelous contempt for black people. You wily Caucasians. Here's to you. Yep. Well, I'll tell you were phenomenal. You absolutely were phenomenal. I love the way you handled those corporate attorneys. - Four corporate attorneys. - Four. - Like a pro. - Four, count 'em, four. Like a pro. And I really liked the eye-to-eye contact. - Very impressive. - That's all part of people skills. Very impressive. Absolutely. - If I'm going to have any influence... - SECRETARY: Good morning, Mr. Marshall. Yeah. Gonna have any influence on someone, you've got to know how to press their buttons. By the way, have you noticed how Roddy has been in the mornings? He's been real nervous. - Rodder? - Yeah, he's... - How did you notice that? - You know, he used to pop those vitamins and now he's into these Rolaids and Tums. [Street chuckles] Well, the strain, the strain at the top. STREET: My work as attorney for the DHRC carried me to considerably higher echelons of power. Hobnobbing with His Honor, Mayor Coleman Young - was an honor in itself. - How are you doing, today, Doug? Alright, sir, fine. How about yourself? STREET: My connection with Mayor Young was tenuous, but he did remember my name. - No complaints. Try me tomorrow. - Right. Very good. STREET: You know, politics might be interesting. REPORTER: Mayor Young. STREET: "Poli-tricks." [tape rewinding] Every evening found me working late, but do I mind? Reviewing video depositions is easy. Renewing broken lines of communication between a husband and wife, now that's hard. Little things like pancake syrup get in the way. I didn't tell you to put that much syrup on. But I thought you'd like it. That's why I added extra. [insistent knocking on door] I have a general rule of thumb. Avoid answering the door whenever possible. [knocking continues] How do you do? Is Mr. William Douglas Street Jr. at home? - Yes. - And may that be you, sir? Yes. May we come in for a little musical confection, sir? - Yeah. - Then this is for you.

Hey, babe. I wonder how long Gabrielle's gonna stay locked up in the bathroom this time. God, this marriage has gone sour. Sour like cottage cheese gone bad. There's too much tension around here. And tension kills. No matter what I do, she's steady on my case. All she does is nag nag, nag. "Get a job, get a life, get a grip." Yeah, grip this. I don't know if she's gonna like this toy. It's really going to add some spice to the game. I wonder how much Darren shelled out for this? Oh God, Gabrielle is such a drag. The only game she wants to play is "Gimme." "Gimme money," "Gimme a car," "Gimme Godiva chocolate." "Gimme perfume." "Gimme clothes." Give me a break. Danielle is getting to be just like her. "Gimme games." "Gimme toys." "Gimme dance lessons." "Gimme candy." "Gimme Barbie." Danielle? Danielle? Uh... [sinister interior laugh] Time to play. Danielle? Come to Papa. [innocent toy piano music] I'm going to... kill. Yes, yes, yes. - Daddy, look it's blood! - Uh Huh. Oh Daddy, why you do that? - It's cause I'm sick. - Sick? I'm so sick. I'm so... Screwed up. I am so insane. So insane. Does that tickle? Does it tickle right there? GABRIELLE: Why you two so quiet out there? Tell me. Tell me really. Does it tickle like that? Aha. But what about if we tickle like this? Oww! Oww! Doug, what is going on? What do you think you're doing? Here, let me wipe that blood off your neck. I'm sick and tired of trying to get these stains out. - Oh, Mommy, you messed up the game! - And your Daddy messed up more laundry. Come on, it's time for you to go to bed anyway. And Doug, it's time for you to go to the asylum. This is the stuff that washes out. GABRIELLE: Yeah, and I'm the one that's gotta wash it out. - Good night, babe. - DANIELLE: Good night. STREET: That night in bed, I suddenly realized she hadn't mentioned money once. She was finally accepting the fact that money wasn't everything, and even if it was, that I didn't have any. - Babe.. - Mmnh? What? Can you see my eyes moving under my eyelids? Yes I can. - Babe? - What? If you act real nice, I'll let you kiss my booty. Promises, promises. Mmh, babe. Your socks are kicking. Kicking? Kicking with what? With odor. Mmh... [low chuckle] STREET: The next day I went to work fortified. September 12th, 1985. And I want to be very clear about this. I am sitting on top of the oyster that is my world. I'm so happy all of my feelings are registering as cliches. I've got a song in my heart, love on my lips, stuff like that. I was totally accepted by the Commission. In fact, Mr. Marshall called me a godsend in front of the whole staff one day. Speak on it, Mary. MARY: Coffee is here. Would you care for a sweet roll? Mmh. Cut the sweet roll Mary, who needs 600 empty calories? - Send the coffee in this vicinity. - Over and out. Thank you... Who knows, things might even work out between Gabriel and me. I hadn't told her that Mr Marshall was about to put me on payroll- that was going to be a surprise. Some people call me "Mr. Wonderful," other people call me "wonderful," close friends call me... - Doug! - Yeah. Yeah they call me that, too. William Douglas Street Jr. VOICE OF DOCUMENTARY NARRATOR: Born in a log cabin in the backwoods of Kentucky, young Douglas soon elevated himself from field hand to Tiger, from Tiger to reporter and from reporter to doctor, from doctor to coed, from coed to attorney, from attorney to Congressman, from Congressman to President. - I could play President. - Doug. Huh? There's a state marshal in the outer office asking for you. He has 30 armed policemen with him. - You are joking. - No. [phone ringing] Yes Mary? MARY: Mr. Street, there are several gentlemen... - here to see you. - POLICE: Where's his office? I'll be right out. Fire exit. Yeah. [sighs] [swoosh of guillotine] [insistent knocking] - William Douglas Street? - Don't forget the Junior. I have a warrant here for your arrest. Would you step over here, please? Put your hands against the wall. Let's get rid of the cigarette. [handcuffs clicking on] Doug, is there anyone you'd like me to call? Yeah, I'd appreciate it if you could call my wife. The number is LV6-3600. Gabrielle Street. Tell her... COLLEAGUE: Where you being taken? Yeah, I don't know. Where are you taking me? You don't have to worry about contacting your wife. She knows where you're being taken. She's in contact with us. Gabrielle. I do love you, Doug. Gabrielle! I do love you, Doug. I do, I do, I do love you, Doug. [Doug laughs] Oh... Freud spent a lifetime searching for an answer to the question "What does woman want?" He died never having found the answer, but I've got the answer. I know what woman wants, and it's not pantyhose either. It's blood. I do love you, Doug. [laughs maniacally] DETECTIVE: Shall we go? I'd like to take something with me. What's that? Those two books on my desk by the lamp. DETECTIVE: Alright. [haunting merry-go-round music] Once upon a time it rained 9 or 10, maybe 9 inches in the forest and a lot of the pathways that the animals used for walking around were flooded. Have you got that? So, like, it's a major disaster area. And the scorpion, you see, he's searching for some way, any way, to get across the stream, which was now very much like a river because of the heavy precipitation. Now the scorpion being a scorpion couldn't swim and he was standing by the edge of the water talking about it. Uh-oh. The scorpion felt enormous psychological and -psychosomatic -Pressure. How can he ever get across the surging rivers skedaddle back home to his mom and his dad and his apartment, his 45's, and his personal computer and his destiny? Which is to sting your ass! Ow. In any case, the scorpion is so worried he's beside himself, his favorite position. And then all at once a frog appeared alongside the scorpion. And the frog said, - "the rain was truly radical. - I see you later." And then the Scorpion said, "wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute! How are you going to get across?" And the frog said, "I'm going to swim across." So, the scorpion brightened up considerably, because he had an idea. Okay, Frog, you give me a ride on your back when we get to the other side, I'll reimburse you with some chips. "I got your chip." But the frog wasn't exactly a moron. The frog was stupid. He said, "I'm comatose. How are you?" And the frog said: "If I give you a ride, then you'll sting me and I'll die. And then everybody will come to my funeral and say, 'he really was a moron, wasn't he?'" And the Scorpion said, "Trust me." Yeah, right. "You know you can trust me. Why would I sting you when you're saving my life?" The frog stopped and thought. The Scorpion's logic was irrefutable. Even Mr Spock couldn't argue with that. It would be crazy to bite the hand that fed you or in this case sting the back that bore you. The frog said, "Alright, hop on, But this is going to cost you a lot of chips." "Oh yes, I know I know," whispered the scorpion, gratefully, as he delicately positioned himself squarely on top of the frog. The frog leaped into the stream with the scorpion on his back. He had to swim real real hard, 'cause the current was against him. When the frog was halfway across, he began to feel a little tired, but he kept going anyway. This is where those aerobics classes paid off. And then the scorpion stung the frog with his deadly poisonous stinger. Big deal. Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow! The frog could feel the poison numb his arms and legs. They began to stiffen up. "I could just d-i-e die." "Don't worry, you will." He began to sink. Yikes! Before he did, he had to ask the scorpion one question. "Why, why, why, why did you do it, you fool? Now we're both going to die! What could you have been thinking of? - What? - Why?" Right before they sank to their death, the scorpion kinda shrugged and said: "Well because, it's my character."
