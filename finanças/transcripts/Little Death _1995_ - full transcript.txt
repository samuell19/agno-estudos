The day I was born, my father was away on business. My mother sent him my picture. He said: "This monster can't be my son. He's too ugly. There must be a mistake." But it was me. Martial? - How do I look? - What's with you? Be honest. Am I ugly? Hideous. That's why you're in my bed. Why? Do you want to trade places... ...and let me photograph you? - Is it set at 60? - Yeah, trust me. C'mon, don't take all night. I told you, not until I come! OK, my love. Hurry up. Shit! She's here. Come in. - You're not ready! - Good observation. Hello. This is Martial, a... friend. My sister Camille. Give me 2 minutes to get dressed. These are nice. Is there a theme? That's your brother's specialty: Photographing men while they come. - They're faking? - No. There's no point otherwise. Check out this one. See? I've got a little drop of sperm on my cheek. How charming! Anyway, I'm not surprised. Even when he was little he... - I hope he pays you! - Why should he? We live together, that's enough for me. What do you do? I took over my father's business. It's going well. Can we go now? Bye. Where did you dig that one up? Listen, if you're going to make snide remarks, I'm not coming. - I'm sorry, but... - No buts! OK? That's the way it is. I can't even ask about your lover without you getting mad. Still mad? - About what? - Martial. Nah, I don't care. So what have you been up to? I don't know. Nothing much. Still as silent as ever! What do you want to know? Anything. Tell me about your life, what you're doing... ...your new photos... Listen Camille, I don't feel like talking to you. Especially not now. OK, fine. I get it. I'll shut up. Look, Camille... Go ahead, I don't feel up to it. I don't believe it. Make an effort! It's been 6 years. I can't. Listen, I know it isn't easy, but don't leave now... ...when he's right here! Go on! - Hi Daddy! - Hi sweetie. Look who's here. Hello, sir. But Dad... - Paul, let me explain. - What now? He's very ill. He's lost touch with reality. - Don't be angry with him. - For what? Not recognizing me? I'm used to it. Ticket, please. Sir, your ticket. I don't have one. That'll be 150 francs. Haven't got it. Then it's 270 francs. I.D., please. This isn't you. Take off your glasses. Oh shit, my mistake. These are Martial's jeans. OK, off the train! Please, sir... It could happen to anyone! My fatherjust died. So this is when you get in? How'd it go? Fine. Tell me about it. - Leave me alone. - But I fixed dinner... Want some? Has he been asleep long? Yes, he should wake up soon. What the hell are you doing? Have you lost your mind? Oh, it's the Perfect Daughter! She's a saint! Give it back! Selfish pig! You've got no respect! You only care about your stupid photos. Do you ask a baby before taking its photo? What are you on about? I'm not in the mood. I've had it. This can't go on. What? The way you're acting. You won't talk to me, you won't eat. You don't want me to touch you. Do I turn you off or what? I'm not hungry. Do you want to leave? I don't know. You don't know, you never know. Make an effort! - You just take and never give. - Stop it. Tell me what's wrong. I don't know. Yes, hello. Here he is. It's your sister. Camille? You alright? When? No, I can't... Please don't insist. Bye. So? My father is dead. When did it happen? She didn't say. During the night, I guess. How old was he? 60 something. You should have come. I hate funerals. Yeah, you're right. It was a big drag, too hot out. It's nicer in bed with Martial. Here you go again... Not at all! I understand! Dad never could stand you, he thought you were ajerk. Why spend a boring day with your bourgeois family? After all, they hate gays! Speaking of which, I bet your boyfriend's a good lay. You wear me out, Camille. Don't make a scene. Who's making a scene? I'm just fine, no problem. You've got the problem. Look at you. For 10 years you've sulked like a misunderstood martyr. Give it a rest for once. Talk to me. There's nothing to say. You're delirious. I'm delirious! Am I the nutcase who photographed my naked father on his deathbed? I know you won't talk to me, and you don't want to listen. But let me tell you... you aren't the only one who hurts. It's been hard for me, too. Working with him was good. I was happy, but sometimes... I thought I would suffocate. I thought about you a lot. I admired you so much. You broke the ties, created your own life. You're free. You seem happy with Martial. He loves you. But my love life! It's just one big fiasco. Pretty dumb, huh? I always wished I could talk to you about it. Why am I telling you all this? You couldn't care less. You know, Dad woke up while you were taking pictures. Really? You didn't notice? Anyway, it made him happy. You were finally photographing your family. I know you want nothing from him. But he wanted me to give you these. They're his favorite photos. I've never seen them. He took them on his travels.
