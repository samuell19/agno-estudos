Check! - Check! Check! Guddu Rangeela and party welcome all of you. Let's start with the program.. "And as per tradition, we begin with" Guddu's joke. Once a man went on a world tour, to London. He arrived in London. And, while roaming around he needed to pee. He stood before a wall and started peeing. Suddenly...'the London Police arrived. They arrested him and took him to the police station. Anyway...he got out of there and arrived in India. Here he noticed that anyone can pee anywhere. He noticed Ghanta Singh peeing in front of a huge wall. He walked up to him and said.. "Singh sir.. ...doesn't the police catch when you're peeing?" To which Singh sir replied.. "No...one has to do it by himself." That's the end of Guddu's joke. But coming up next is.. Yours, truly... Mirpur's Kumar Sanu. One and only item" Rangeela! First, heartiest congratulations to.. ...Lambardar Chaudhary Nafe Singh's son Vinod Singh.. "For getting a visa to Kenya. I wish that the lads from our area keep getting visas.. "And they keep throwing such visa parties. What else could one ask for'? So let's begin, with a modern devotional song. And the song's called "Mata's Email". Clap! So how much money does that Lumbardar have? Not much... He was all show, no go. His wife though was hot. But his safe...was dry and cold! Around 10-12 kilos of gold.. "And 5-7 lakhs in cash. That's it. Did you check properly" ...or were you busy inside? Why're you being jealous? You could've joined in. There was room for two. That's all he has. Fine... ...we'll pass the information to Pujari tomorrow morning Why do we always pass on the information to Pujari? We can do the looting too. I've told you a thousand times. Don't you get it'? I don't want to commit a crime. I see. Can I ask a question? What's this...that we're doing? H' it wasn't for the case.. ...I wouldn't be doing this job either. And your greed will get us killed some day. This isn't greed. We do all the hard work. We do the research. And pass the information to Pujari? Why? And what do we get'? Jack squat. Think about it, bro h' we do this job ourselves. "We can be millionaires in a month. And when the month's over'? They'll put so many bullets in your backside... ...you'll never even be able to sit again. A little hard work and information gets us a square meal. Learn to be happy. When will you think beyond the one square meal? Why can't we be gangsters? Come. Come on, I'll make you a gangster. Come. Bro where are you taking me'? You want to be a gangster, don't you? Here. Hold it. Take it. See that man'? - Shoot him. - He hasn't done me any harm? Why would I shoot him? Why? Scared'? You're a gangster, aren't you? Shouldn't make a difference who you kill. Shoot him. Shoot. - I.. I'll shoot him. I'm serious. Shoot. Think again, Rangeela, I will shoot him. Shoot! Gangster. Shoot! Keep it. You win, I lose. Okay? You always do this to me whenever I talk some sense. No guts...but wants all 'the glory. Lambardar Nafe Singh. From Palawaas'? Believe me, he's a gold mine. His boy's got a visa and he's going abroad. The guy's loaded. I've never seen women decked with so much gold. At least 40-50 kilos of gold. And cash... Not a penny less than 2.5 million. You've been making really tall claims these days. Remember that incident about the doctor from Ambala. "Pujari...he's loaded." "He eats in a silver platter." "Sleeps on a bed made of gold." But I didn't get a single penny when I raided his home. Took four boxes of Crocin, and they were also fake. This is a sacred place. Atleast you shouldn't lie in a temple. What's this'? 10,000'? - Pujari, that's too less. - Give it back. Sell your information to someone else. No no... Its ok, we accept. And yes, raid his mace between “10pm and “pm. That's the time when the power supply's cut. And listen, don't get too trigger happy and shoot. The Chaudhary has a number of guns. ' Maradona' . ' Messi- baba' . This is there too! Hand me the trishool. The triangle. Give it to me. Mangey Ram, what are you doing here with that candle? You tell me what you're doing here. This is my heist. How can this be your heist'? I paid 10,000 rupees Guddu Rangeela. "For giving me the information of this house. Oh hello! Pujari...I paid them 50,000 as well. Now get lost. Here comes the 3rd one. Now who's coming'? Khayali, who sold you information of this place? Guddu Rangeela. I paid them 20,000 rupees. Now, Run away you two. Listen...l paid 'them 'too. You both, get lost. You think this is a tea party. Get lost, and you too uncle. You two get lost. You two get lost. ...because I paid the highest price tor this information. Get lost! Hands up. I paid them too" ...so that they don't squeal about my wealth. Bloody rascals. Hands up! Arghhh! Guddu Rangeela! Come in. - I hope no one saw you coming in'? - No. Here you go. That's 80,000. Look, Rangeela... ...I know you very well. I wonder where you get all this money from'? But lady justice is not taking her blindfold off. The decision could be against our favor. Don't blame me if anything goes wrong. What are you saying? Blame you? You've done so much for us. You've been fighting our war for the past 10 years. You didn't even let us get revealed. Just tell us how much money you need, and we'll arrange for it. H' we lose here, we'll approach the higher court. We'll do what we can. The rest is His will. Whether He makes us win or lose? Greetings, sir. Where are the boy and girl'? We nabbed them last night at Sonipat Bus Depot. And according to the Council's decision. "We chopped the boy up last night, and dumped his body in the canal. And the girl'? That's the problem, sir. The girl belongs to our community. The Council's decided.. "That her own family will have to kill her. But I don't understand why, Amichand is falling weak. He says she's his only daughter“. And what about the humiliation she caused us'? And the Council's decision? That's exactly why we called Don Billoo here for. Billo sir. Billo sir. Careful...the girl's father has a gun. - Chote! - Yes, brother. Don't come forward, or I will shoot. Listen to me, Amichand, this won't benefit anyone. I'll shoot...! I'm serious. What will you get by shooting me, Amichand'? I am here to talk with you. Believe me... ...we'll do as you say. Come on...hand me the gun now. Come on. Bravo. She's my only daughter. I was blessed with her after praying for years. She's just a kid, and she made a mistake. How can I strangle my own daughter? The Council's gone crazy. I know, Amichand. I know. Be strong. Your daughters like my child too. What to do? There have been many instances. "When the Council had to take stern decisions. "To preserve the norms of our society. Sit. Everyone loves their child. Last year, when your daughter passed her 12th exams.. ...I brought a cake for her from Rohtak. Remember? Think about it, Amichand. Your daughter was missing for a week.. ...with a boy that belonged to an interior caste. She's tarnished everything. Now...we'll have to clear this blemish, Amichand. One has to sever the limb that goes bad. Almighty Lord Shiva has given you an opportunity to earn merit. What merit will I earn by killing my own daughter? Karma! You know the Council's decision cannot be averted. H' you don't do it, someone else will. Hail Lord Shankar! - This isn't right, Gulab Singh. Earlier the inspector would cordially invite us to the police station. Why treat us like terrorists now'? You see...my father used to say. You have to save all your 'NO's for the house. And 'yes' for your work... Sir said arrest and I arrested you. We always send him his share. So why did he need to arrest us'? I wasn't even allowed to finish my film!. The inspector's been suspended, Guddu? Why? Well...in his drunken stupor" "the inspector sent an MMS to the DSP's wife. Madam replied, "This is not the way." The inspector thought she's flirting back. He sent her a love-letter along with an blue film CD. He was saying, "What has happened, Gulab Singh?" I said, "You and your extra-marital affairs." I was going through some old files. 16 burglaries in six months. And the investigation proves.. ...you both performed in each of these houses one day before the burglary. Sir...we're just ordinary orchestra party players. Sir...we're just ordinary orchestra party players. You two sing less... and make others dance more. But, sir... I'm not in the mood to thrash anyone today, early in the morning. Just had a prayer meeting at home. I just got posted here. Paid 5 million to get transferred here. I had to mortgage my wife's jewelry to arrange the money. I promised to give her back double before the next Karwa Chauth. You make some contribution too. Pay me one million...and continue with your singing and dancing. Or else the police will have to do their job. But, sir...what can 'the police do without evidence? - What'? - What can the police do? You fool...you should better be asking what all can the police do. The police can recover a CD of Ghulam Ali from your pocket. "And brand you a terrorist. Take your photograph outside a beauty salon.. "And prove you're a pimp. You know what baby powder is? We can recover a packet from your pocket. "And make you a drug smuggler. What's more...we can match - But he's dead. - Who knows? Have you seen him? Look...I've an opportunity in both my hands. Either you pay me one million.. ...or I'll accuse you for all these 16 burglaries. "And get the Bravery Award from the Commissioner! Now you decide what you want to do. Good day. Now leave. This way. Come on. What can the police do? Where will we get one million'? I don't know. Welcome, mister. You took longer than expected. What the" I told you we were making a mistake. Now be prepared to get shot. Look, Pujari, I know you're angry. Lower the gun and I'll explain everything. Why don't you explain us as well? And...don't forget us. He was the only one missing. Now explain to them all. Look...it's not like you all think. What else is it'? Ifs exactly what you all think it is. We duped all of you! - Do you want to get us killed? Have you lost your mind'? It was an emergency. I needed money. You wouldn't have lent me even if I had asked. So we sold the same information to all three. You can shoot me if you like. - But shoot him first. - Rangeela. - Because this dumb idea was his. - What are you saying? I am hungry. I will die only after I finish lunch. Rangeela! Bro! Bro, why are you leaving me alone? Listen to me. Cold hearted man! So... What about you, handsome? Rangeela. Pujari, there's a bottle of pickle behind you. Just hand it to me. The lime one. Don't forget, my name's Rangeela. H' you try to mess with me.. I'll shoot once, but for the rest of the six months you'll exhale smoke! And my name's Guddu. Even if I don't shoot you. For 6 months you'll also exhale smoke... Bro, I am sure... Someone's squealing on us. We'll have to find out who. - I know who. - Who'? - Gora Bengali. - Why that. Really!?... Stop! Where do you think you're going, Bengali'? What did you think'? You can escape after squealing on us. I swear... I swear I didn't do it. I quit my job as a police informer. - Don't lie, Bengali. - I swear on my kids. Here. Now I handle Underworld's PR. Being a Police informer is much more risky. One information and the entire gang comes after you. Even the Police can't dare to touch the Underworld's informer. Why were you following us'? I've a job for you two. - Ifs a proposal. - Don't lie, Bengali. I swear on my kids. Would I falsely swear on my kids? What's the proposal? Look, Rangeela, I'll be frank with you. You two are stuck in a big mess. Inspector Ajay Singh...is a corrupt officer. And I know...you don't have one million to give him. But...I've a job for you two" "through which you can earn a million in two days. A million in two days'?! What's the job'? Ifs simple. You just need to pick up something from one place.. "And transfer it to another. What'? Look, Rangeela, don't get charged up. First hear me out. You see...there's a girl you need to pick up from Chandigarh. "And deliver her to Delhi. That's it. Look, Bengali, we don't do kidnappings. Kidnap.. You don't have to kidnap her. Ifs like this, I've a client in Delhi. He's a big-shot business man. His daughter lives in Chandigarh. The girl's deaf and mute" "and she teaches at a school in Chandigarh. But she...has fallen for some useless boy. Her family tried everything they could.. "But the girl doesn't seem to agree. With no other options left, her family fixed her marriage. Now I've taken the contract. "To deliver the girl to her wedding. That's all. How much are you getting? Two million. One for you...and one for me. Come here.. We'll do this job. Say yes. "Say yes?" It's a kidnapping after all. Guddu, we won't kidnap anyone. Then what else will you do? Go to jail... ...get blamed for 16 burglaries. And what about the case'? H' we get locked up, who will defend the case'? Take my advice for once. Just say yes, we don't have another option. When do we leave? Tomorrow morning. Do you like Salman or Shahrukh'? Yes, Bengali'? - Did you do the job'? - The job's done. We've just left Chandigarh. We'll be in Delhi in a couple of hours. - No, no...don't come to Delhi yet. - Why? There's a problem. The client's haggling over 'the price. What are you saying? Yes...we'll get the money late. Until then we'll have to keep the girl somewhere safe. She's not a packet of opium that I can hide away. Where do I take her'? I know...take her to Shimla. I know a guy there. He'll give you a place to stay for few a days. - Look, Bengali, you're just. - Don't worry. I am there. You will get your money. - Yeah, but. - lt's only for a couple of days, Rangeela. You can comfortably live here for the next couple of days. I've made all arrangements for your food. Liquor...we've got imported, have fun. Whose house is this? It belongs to a foreigner lady. She comes down here once in 2-4 years. I am the caretaker. Your name? Chunnilal. Chunnilal! Rangeela! She's getting away. Stop. I'm doing it. Pull your hand in. Stop, or else I will shoot. Stop! Stop or I'll shoot. Stop! She's deaf, how's she going to hear you? Get down there. Stop the car! SM“ This is an insult to us. - We should've shot her. - Are you crazy? Shoot a girl?! - You didn't tie her properly? - No I tied her properly! - You two are back? Bangali...was making such tall claims. He said you two were like 'Jai-Veeru' from 'Sholay You two failed so pathetically. Couldn't even handle a single girl. What's she doing here? Where else would she go? Acting smart, are you? Tell me what's going on here, or I will blow your brains out. Don't shoot him inside the house. I don't like bloodshed in the house. She isn't deaf and mute'? Why? Don't you like me talking? I can answer your question. But Bangali's asked me not to do so. How about some breakfast. ...while we're waiting for him? Do you eat omelets'? - Why did you run in the first place? - She was testing you two. Like 'Thakur' in 'Sholay. But you two failed, sorry! - The Session's Court today acquitted Billoo Pehalwan of all charges. - ..Regarding a 10 year old case in Mirpur which involved the Council. - Let me remind you, Billoo Pehalwan was accused of murdering two people. - Human Rights worker and Lawyer BP Gupta. - ..Who's been defending this case for 10 years now.. - ..Has decided to appeal against this verdict in the district court. Do you know what you're saying, Mr. President? - Now that the court case is over.. - ..I should make Billoo a Minister? - You do know about his image, don't you? I want to give a clean-image government to the people. I want to encourage educated and honest people.. "And not goons like him. - But, madam.. - No ifs or buts. Frankly speaking, I would throw people like Billoo out of the party. Including them in the cabinet is out of the question. You're making a mistake, madam. We might need Billoo again during the elections. H' only your father was alive today" "he would've definitely understood this. Times have changed, Mr. President. Look, at any cost...the government's image should remain intact. That's all. Anyway, let's keep all this aside and have lunch. Come on. Look...I don't like twisting words. I'll tell you the entire story. So you already know...she isn't deaf or mute. But she teaches children that are deaf and mute. That's true. She's from a rich family, true. But her family is miserly. But this girl...she's ambitions. When things couldn't be sorted the right way.. "We had to use other means. With God's grace...she ran into me. We made a plan. The girl agreed to be kidnapped willingly. I knew it...something's wrong. - Come, Guddu. - We're not doing anything wrong. We're only helping 'the girl. It's social work. To hell with your social work. Pay us our share and do whatever you want. What will you do with the money? Don't be so sentimental, Rangeela. We'll get at least 100 million as ransom money. 100 million'? 2O million each. Our lives will be set. Tell me something, Bengali. Anyone could've done this job. Why us? Good question. - Now finally, you've asked the right question. I've known you two for years. You two are rascals. Make shifters. But you two are honest. Ifs hard to find such honest people in this business. And what's more important. You share an old connection with this girl's family. Which family is she from'? Her name is Baby. And she's Don Billoo's sister-in-law, Rangeela. You were all praises about them, Bangali. Can they do the job'? 100 percent. I've carefully selected these two. Don Billoo is their weakness. You see.. When crime gets a personal touch, it becomes passionate. - Who is it'? - Uncle. - Rangeela. Bless you. - Daughter-in-law. - Hello, Uncle - Look who's here. - Guddu! Look at him. How are you, Guddu'? Your sister-in-law. Take her blessings. - Hello, sister-in-law. - It's okay. - Go get some sweets. - Yes. Fine. Be back soon. - Are you two okay? - Yes. Rangeela, you two shouldn't have come here. The villagers are very angry. And everything that was published in the media.. ...has added to their rage. The Council held a meeting yesterday. They have decided to kill you two. Uncle, I have married Babli. And inter-caste marriage is not a crime by law. Our case was even brought up in the Parliament. The Chandigarh High Court has given us Police Security. How can anyone just kill us'? No, sir... This is the community's internal problem. The Law shouldn't interfere. But we're their security given by the court. I'll fill your backside with bullets. Even your children will be born of metal. Go and sit there. I'm sending tea and snacks for you. Go. Come on. They will never accept this relationship. We're a family of musicians, and they are upper caste people. They are here. Kashiram, open the door! They won't spare you. Leave. I say run. Rangeela, take care of my Guddu! Go, go! They must have run out the backdoor. Go kill them. Come on. Look, he's trying to run away from there. Catch him. Don Billoo. Don Billoo! Stop! Rangeela. Babli! Babli! Lawyer Sir, Rangeela speaking. We won't appeal in the High court. We'll have to settle this outside the court. Yes. Happy birthday, Don Billoo. Happy birthday, Don Billoo. - The number you're calling is currently switched off. - Please call again later. - The number you're calling is currently switched off. - Please call again later. - The number you're calling is currently switched off. - Chhotey. - Yes, brother. When did you last talk to baby? Around 5-6 days ago. What happened? Nothing. I wonder where she is. Her number's unreachable too. She was saying "I'll definitely attend brother-in-laws birthday". She was also talking about some special gift 'for your birthday. Special gift'? Well then...call up at Chandigarh, and find out what's wrong. - Yes. - And listen. Don't get too drunk. First call her and inform me. Come on. - Baby, where are you? - I'm sure Baby didn't make it, Don Billoo. - Who? Who's speaking? Wvx-x-x-o: k-k-k wvx-x-x-o: - Baby didn't come to your party. She's angry with you? - Why? - Because... ...she's in our custody. Do you know...who you're talking to'? I do. But you don't know... who you're talking to. What do you want'? I'll call when I decide. Happy birthday. I told you find out about Baby, didn't I'? Very good morning. Your brother-in-laws heart skipped a beat last night. Rangeela can do anything once he makes up his mind. He called him from inside Billoo's own house. Just watch... ...how your brother-in-laws going to dance to our tunes. In fact, we can even turn him into a rooster" "and he'll crow every morning. That reminds me of a joke... Shall I tell you? Fine, if you insist so much, I'll tell you. Once a hen went to a shop and said.. "Give me two eggs." The shopkeeper replied, "Don't you lay eggs?" The hen replied, "Yes, I do." But my rooster said, "Why spoil your figure for two rupees?" I must admit one thing. You're really shrewd and crafty. What a charade. You don't look so dangerous. Even you don't look as stupid as you are. What the" You're exactly my type. Loudmouth. Listen. Listen. Can I ask you something frankly? Go ahead. - Will you tell anyone? - Say it already? Will you give me some...ahem'? Have you seen your face'? Dog! Hello, sir. Come. Greetings, sir. Move Back. All the goons, thugs, chain-snatchers, gangsters. ...I rounded up everyone last night. In fact...l even got small-time crooks. Sir, can I say something. God's blessed me with a short body but a cunning brain. My experience says ifs not one of them. - Excuse me, sir. Hello. We've traced the kidnapper's location. What the" This call was made from your home. Is there a traitor amongst you sir'? Here's the dictionary of the Underworld. - Sir.. - What have you got'? I don't understand this case. Someone kidnapped one of your family members?! These are really dark times. Come to the point. Don't worry, sir, they will be apprehended soon. You just relax and watch. Find them soon...or else you won't survive either. Move Back! Hello, Shimla Apple store. Give the phone to Rangeela. Yeah, Bengali. Rangeela, the place is burning up. Yes. The rascals in a bad condition. He hasn't slept all night. He's making the police run all around the city. I say...the iron is hot. Before they find any clue about it, strike hard. Fix a meeting for the ransom and get the money. What happened? What was he saying? He was saying, the iron's hot, and we should strike now. Fix a meeting for the ransom. He's right. Make the call. I suggest that we'll take his money.. "And also shoot him. We won't get the money so easily, Guddu. Why? Somethings wrong. But, Everything's clear now. What's wrong now'? There. That's the problem. We're screwed here, and you're humming a song. What'? What are you? She must be humming to hide her tension. You see.. Why would a scoundrel like Billoo, who cares for no one" ...pay 100 million for a cheap bitch like you. Tell me the truth. What do you care'? Mind your business. Am I talking to you? Stand there quietly. Rangeela, stay in your limits. Guddu, give him a tight slap. He should see stars in a single blow. How dare you slap me'? Hey... 3 years ago my sister got married to Billoo. But my sister was never happy in that house. My Father left no stone unturned in the marriage. He fulfilled all their demands for dowry.. "And gave them all that he could. - But Billoo would bother my sister for dowry. - He would beat her up. And he would bring other women in front of my sister, and" And one day suddenly we heard that she committed suicide. I knew it was a lie. She was murdered. Because within a year of my sisters death" ...Billoo married the Aggarwal Builder's only daughter. That was the moment I decided.. "To avenge my sister's death. Recover all the money given in dowry with interest. - I got in touch with Billoo again. - And started visiting his home more often. - I have many videos of his sleaziness. - H' this CD is leaked, his political career will be over. But Billoo was growing suspicious. He was trying to convince me to come back. But I knew I couldn't face him alone. That's when I met Bengali, and" You know the rest. He will pay 100 million for this CD, not for this cheap bitch You turned out to be one of those emotional types. I was thinking otherwise. That rascal has... ...ruined all our lives. You know... ...he burned my father alive. H' it wasn't for Rangeela. I can't imagine what would've happened to me. But after meeting you I feel, Rangeela is right. Our time has come. You'll catch a cold. Here, take the shawl. My 100 million. What's the news? They called asking for the ransom. How much'? 100 million. Where did they call you? Chandigarh Rock Garden. The real fun will begin now. We'll teach them a lesson.. ...they'll never forget for generations to come. Those two rascals will regret they were ever born. I want to fly to Rock Garden right now. Yes. Why do you think there's two? I...I.. Two... Normally there are 2-4 people in a gang. That's why... No! You didn't say two or four. You said.. "Those two rascals will regret they were ever born." Why did you say two, you oaf'? I just guessed.. 0177.. Where does the code belong to, Chhotey'? That's Shimla's code. But, you're from Kolkata. Who's there in Shimla? I ordered some apples for my family. Must be his number. You see, because my father's unwell. How odd. By now we should be reaching chandigarh to receive the ransom Rangeela! Why should Bangali be calling now'?! Answer it. Okay. - Shimla Apple Store. - What's the rate of apples? Which ones? Kinnori are Rs. 145 per kilo, and Manali is Rs. 165 per kilo. Hello? Who is speaking? Billoo! I told you ifs the apple store's number. By the way, h' you want to order some for yourself" ...order the ones from Manali, they're very juicy. Don Billoo...we've traced the location of the second call. It was from Shimla. Now you're stuck Obama! - Break his leg! I don't know anything. You've made him look like a ghost. But he still hasn't said anything. No... Sir... Please believe me, sir. I've worked so many years for you. I swear on my kids. I've worked so many years for you. Will you speak up'? Guddu. Rageela! Come on, surround the place. Check upstairs. Check inside. Come on. Go. They ran away. I 'told you...'they weren't going 'to wait 'for us here. - Everyone, go out! - How's the movie, my dear brother-in-law'? Baby?! I've waited really long for this. I won't spare you without taking my revenge. - Get that. And if this CD's leaked. ...the CM will never let you set toot in the Parliament. And ifs not difficult for me to get to the CM. After all, I am her MLA's only sister-in-law. I knew it...This had to be your plan The day I get my hands on you.. ...I will skin you alive. Remember, I wield the power of Lord Shiva's third eye. Every time it opens, there will be destruction. Bro... What if they're holding Bangali on the top floor? We'll send him a message. "Sorry...not reachable". Bangali's one of us. We can't leave him to die. We'll take him back with us. Think about it again. - There must be an army inside. - Only half. The other half’s gone to Shimla. Fine...come on then, let's go. - Where are you going? - Let's go. I am going inside, and you, will wait by the car. Why? I am coming along too. I am not a kid anymore. I can get Bangali out of there alone. - Alone? - Of course. Fine, then you go and I'll wait by the car. Fine...I am going alone, brother. Go already. Until you go, you cant really come back can ye'? Bengali. Get up. These people will kill me. Save me. Shhhh... I am here for you. Come and sit on this. Come.. careful. Careful. - Where do you think you're going? What exactly are we trying to do over here? Whose phone is this? Losing your phone can be a real pain. You lose all the numbers. - Whose is R? - R's mine. Take better care oi it next 'time. Who are you? You're holding my hand, sir. What are your intentions? Let go, and I'll tell you. See this. Once I press my finger" ...your brain would be lying on the floor. You made a big mistake pointing that gun at me. Well...answer this. H' you shoot someone on their backside. Where will he shitt from'? The new hole or the old one? How about I shoot you and see? No, I'll shoot yours. Wait, if you move he dies. Tell me, Guddu...left nut or right nut. Left...no, no, right. You're confusing me now. Another minute, and they would've shot you in the bum.. "And mopped the floor with you. Who do you think you are'? You think you're some superman? - And I am some kid. - You are a kid. And you will always be one for me. H' you like raising kids, go adopt one from the orphanage. - I will slap you. - What you'll slap! Shut up! Have you two gone crazy? Don't let them escape. Are you here to rescue me or get me killed?

"Many great hunters tried, but they just couldn't kill him." "He devoured all of them." Ghanta Singh said "It's quite simple". "Make a replica of a cow and leave it in the jungle. "I will sit inside the statue, with my gun." "The lion will think ifs a cow." "As soon as he shows himself, I will shoot him." The villagers made a replica of a cow.. "And left Mr. Singh in the jungle. The entire night passed, there was no trace, neither of the lion nor of Ghanta Singh. The villagers went in the jungle searching for him.. "And noticed the cow's statue was broken and lying on the ground. They got Ghanta Singh out of the statue and asked.. "Singh sir, what happened to the lion?"
