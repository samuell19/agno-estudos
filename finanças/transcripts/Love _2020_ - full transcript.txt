Relax, dear. There's a growth of about eight weeks. So, it must have been two months since you got your last period, right? Shouldn't you remember all this, dear? The treatment is ongoing, right? Shouldn't you keep a track of this? Why should you have unnecessary thoughts amid all this? Shouldn't you try and be happy? Shouldn't you? Look at this. What did the doctor say? You should have bothered to find that out earlier. If you want to say something, just say it. Don't break things instead! I've been with you for so long, and you've been such a cheat! What should I tell you? How am I a cheat? -Yes, Dad. -Hello, son. Are you busy? Hello, son? Can you hear me? Are you busy? No. Tell me. Where are you right now? At office or at home? I am at home. She had called me a couple of times. I couldn't pick up then. When I called back, I couldn't get through to her phone. If she's there, can you give the phone to her? Son? Hello? Hello? She is sleeping. She said she was not feeling too well. Is it? What happened? I was planning to come there. By the way, when will you be free? I wanted to talk to you. What's the matter? It's nothing. It's been a while since we talked, right? I am a little busy now. Shall I call you back later? Okay. Let me know when you are free. Are you happy, now that you've ruined my life? I've been knocking for so long! Where were you? I was really worried. Did you start early today? Not finished it? O savior Absolve all my sins O savior Absolve all my sins O Jesus Show me the path of righteousness What is it? Nothing. I thought I'll drop by to see you before I go. Keep this. For us, the most important thing is the happiness of people we love, right? This is the Police watch we bought when we visited Singapore. You can keep it. That Singapore trip was so much fun, right? Hey! Who doesn't make mistakes in life? We just have to realize them and correct them. Is there something to eat? I'm really hungry. Do you have steamed rice cakes here? That plate is broken. It's a plate, right? Plates break. Today, I could make a decision. Now I know what to do. You know how long it's been since I got some sleep? Because of the stress! And I'm always hungry. Did you eat? Yes. Will you make some fried egg for me? What are you thinking about? What? Shall I fix you another drink? I'm going to die. I have decided. This won't work out. I am completely fed up! Do you know that guy, Shelby? This won't work out. I have decided. I am going to die. Enough is enough! Did you bring it to say all this? I am already losing my mind. Can you please go? What are you doing? At least, show some maturity! Is this how you behave when someone is sharing his emotions with you? Who else can I tell this? I'm telling this to you because I like you. You should respect me, at least! All of you shouldn't treat me the same way. Please. Don't abandon me. What is your problem? I'm asking you with all due respect… what is your problem? The fried egg is burnt. I don't think committing suicide is a crime. If that's what it takes for others to understand us, so be it! Isn't that right? And once we're dead… everyone else is dead to us as well, right? What a messed-up situation! There's something else as well. People don't commit suicide because they wish to die. It's a type of healing. Isn't that right? Think about it. That's how it is. The only mistake I made was I trusted everyone around me. Is that a mistake? What are you saying? Do you know Shelby? Before he joined me, he used to sell clothes at the local market. Now he drives a Mercedes A-class. Do you know that? I started that café with him when everything else failed. It was an awesome idea. An amazing concept. But it failed big-time! And that rascal… is still messing me over. Do you know that? When I tell my wife about it… she says… that I'm mentally ill. What should I tell her? "I am mentally ill." Why didn't she think about it when she decided to be with me? Why has she started thinking about it now? Things are working well for you, right? How are you able to pull this off? Happy life! Happy wife! What's your plan now? I have to go out. You can go ahead. What plans will I have? Where can I go? I will be here. Hey! I can tolerate everything, except the blame games. Whatever I say, she keeps blaming me. She doesn't support me in anything. She doesn't have to support me… but can't she at least stop blaming me? Now what's the problem at your home? Girls are not like how they seem. What can be the problem? It's all going in… but nothing comes out! It's been so many years! You guys are undergoing some treatment for that, right? Treatment, it seems. According to her, she is perfect. Is there a problem with me? Long ago, you got a girl to abort your baby, right? Then, how can you have a problem? Can I tell her this during an argument? It's not like I won a medal, right? I can only tell this to people who understand my point, right? It's karma… for everything I did in the past. That's what I'm saying. I have done everything I can do… for her, for my family, for my friends, for everyone! So, I've decided… I'm leaving! Where are you going? To the washroom. It's not clean. Use the other one. There's some blood on this photo. Please wipe it off. Hi. I am Pradeep Chandran. How to dispose a human body. If you have killed someone deliberately, or if you have been part of a murder… how will you dispose that body? In today's episode, we'll talk about that. There are a few things to keep in mind while disposing a human body… first, imagine the body as three parts. Head, torso and the lower limbs. Now, the exact points. For the upper limbs, it will be at the shoulder. And for the lower limbs, it will be the thigh bone, which is below the hip. Now comes the trickiest part… called as the tourniquet. Tourniquet is used to bind the joints at precise points. And after applying the tourniquet… take the dissection material. Scalpel and forceps. There's was a murder case called the Pon Navarasu murder case… in which this method was perfectly applied. Not even a single drop of blood was found from his room. That was a perfect crime… carried out by Mr. John David. But your case might be different. This may not be the same. In such cases, you should dispose the body parts… in huge oil drums… dipped in sulfuric acid. H2SO4. Let the police come after you and find the circumstantial evidence. Hey! What are you doing in there? You've been in there for a long time. Hey! Let me take a shower. What are you doing? I was looking for something to clean out the trash from the kitchen. Will it fit in that? No. There's some trash here as well. I just took a shower. Shall we have a drink? Come. I told you, right? It's Shelby. He hasn't had enough of troubling me. He's calling to know if he'd get more. -Hey, Shelby! -Are you absconding? No. I'm not absconding. Just that we didn't meet. Where are you now? Everything is happening smoothly for you, right? -Then? -Hey! -Tell me. -I called to say that… someone is ready to buy the equipment of our cafe. It's a good deal. But we'll face a loss of around 1 to 1.5 million. But that won't be enough. I think you'll lose your apartment as well. I have already spoken to your wife about it. I'll come to your place in the evening if you want. If we don't do this now, we'll be in trouble. Think about it. -Did you speak to her? -Yes. Why? Well… do you discuss our conversations with her? Yes, I do. She also should know everything, right? Okay, okay. So, that's it. Why are you talking as if you don't trust me? No, Shelby. I trust you. Then call me once you get home. The three of us can discuss it. We need to solve this quickly. -Did you call her? -Yes. I called her. I told you, right? -What did she say? -What can she say? Shouldn't we solve all this? She asked me to do something as soon as possible. Okay, then. See you at your apartment in the evening. Okay, then. -You guys can decide whatever you want. -What? What can I say now? I am taking your shirt and the hat. I know you won't give it if I ask you. How's it looking? I'm looking smart, right? Shall I leave? I can't stay here anymore. -What the hell are you doing? -No, brother. I've understood it. I understood that you have a lot of problems. Hey! One has to deal with his own problems by himself. And, yeah… if someone says that they saw me somewhere… just inform her about it. Everyone will call you first. Let her also come and see me. He has snatched her away from me. Now I've lost everything. He cheated me in my business… took my apartment… and now he has taken my wife as well. I was the one who gave a new life to that scoundrel! Don't we all have friends? Is this how we behave with our friends' wives? Why should I blame him? She also must have felt the same. I might be their biggest problem. I'll go away. These are just your own thoughts. What you and I think is not the truth. She's a nice girl. I know her! But she's not like that anymore. She has changed a lot. She visits the beauty parlors. She gets facials done. She gets her hair curled. It's true that these are her personal matters… getting facials and all that. But I sleep with her! I know each of the change in her. He became her friend only after he became my partner. And then, she's telling him everything that happens in my house. I am ashamed of telling you about this. Do you understand? When I ask her about this, do you know what she says? "It's because you are sitting at home without a job." What does it mean? It takes time to think. Is the labor for daily wages the only kind of hard work? Is that the only hard work? You tell me. This is a business. When it's a business, there might be losses. We do a lot of things, right? You know about everything I do, right? Sometimes things may fail. In such situations, they should support us. And not leave us for random guys! You know what the funniest part is? I still love her very much. That's why I said… the greatest healing I can get in this situation… as I told you earlier… is committing suicide! I have nothing else left to do now. Is suicide a solution for everything? You tell me what else I should do. If there's a problem between both of you, talk it out and sort it. And stop doing this buffoonery! Do you understand? Have you told her about all these problems? Ever? -That stage is over-- -Does she know all this? If you think there's a problem… if you… if you keep suppressing it, it will explode someday. And that will create huge problems. I am saying this out of my own experience. There would be many problems in life. But we should face them. Women have an entirely different thought process. We can never understand them. Yet we should make an effort. I can't do that now. Yes, you can! You have dealt with it earlier. Didn't you handle a much bigger problem earlier? This is nothing. So, calm down. Call her and talk to her. What your issues are… and what your problems are… make an effort to tell her all of it. You can do it. Take out your phone. Take it. Right now, this support is what I needed in my life! Isn't that why I come to you? I'll call her. Hey! What are you doing? Let go of me. What are you doing? I want to die. You want to die in my house? So that I should be held responsible for that? What did I tell you? I called her as you asked. When I told her that I'm going to die, she asked me to go ahead. -What else can I do? -You'll die because she says it? If she's asking you to die, you should prove her wrong by living happily! That's what a real man should do! Whatever you have to tell Shelby, you should tell him. It's a matter of some money… your problems will be solved if you get that, right? Why should you die for that? Who said that you'll die if you consume detergent? Now you have to vomit it all out. Get up. You must leave, but make sure to use the stairs. I can't go. You should go to a hospital as soon as possible. I can't walk! If you stay here, you'll have to go behind bars. I just want to lie down somewhere. Were you boozing here? -No, sir. -In broad daylight! No, sir. All of you will go to the station. Get everyone. Take everyone into custody. Did you see my message? Then, why aren't you saying anything? What should I do? Holding on here in this situation is not an easy task. My mom will find out easily. I was thinking of coming there. I got it. Don't worry. We'll do the needful. I'll be busy for two days. -I will call you. -Is there some other problem? No. I will call you. Don't worry. Anoop! Come in. What is it? Come on! Did you see the police while coming here? Police? What are you talking about? -I need to use the washroom. -Please go ahead. Hey, she's needs to use the washroom. It's not possible today. -What's the matter? -Both of us are in a big trouble. We can't stay here for long. So, you should leave with her immediately. -What's the problem? -Dude… please listen to me. I came here after confirming with you, right? I am in a bigger problem. If my wife finds out, I might get caught. Let me tell her something so that I can get rid of her. It will be just half an hour. Please. Listen to me. Please! You guys can have a chat. Have it. Come on. Sorry. Dude, please. -Please try and understand. -Just half an hour. She will leave only if I talk to her and settle things. That's the reason. You guys can have a chat. Please. I realized that's not his wife. All of them are the same. What you said is correct. Why should I die? I should seek revenge. I should show them what I can do. Isn't that right? I will do that! Deepthi is quite talented, right? Keep it there and come here. Nail polish! Hereafter, we can't meet like this. What happened? He is always at home now. If he is at home, you don't feel the need to see me, right? Yeah, right! As if you could come all the way to meet me. I traveled all the way to meet you here, right? Here, have some of this. Hey! If I come there to meet you… can we sit like this and talk peacefully? -Tell me. -You didn't come, right? Let me have it. Well… what are you saying? That I don't want to see you, right? Please make some excuses… and get out of your house more often. Won't you? It's not like I don't wish to. I'm staying there only for my child. I know. Anyway, I have discussed about the divorce with a friend. Which friend? She is an advocate. We studied together. She said that even if there are any legal issues… I would get my child's custody. In that case, is it okay if my child stays with me? Why are you beating around the bush? It's a good thing, right? You should do it. Okay. This will become a big problem anyway. When my parents find out, how will I face them? I know that you won't leave everything to be with me. In case, if such a situation arises, what will I do? I'm tired of faking it at home. The other day, I think she even went through my phone. Then? Why didn't you tell me? I will talk to her and convince her. Why should we talk about it now? We have very little time. I'll just freshen up. Do you have to go? Anoop! Where is Anoop? He is inside. Try this. It's awesome. What are you up to? I mean, what business are you doing? I own a café. A café? Where is it? It's at MG Road. At MG Road? There are hundreds of cafés at MG Road. Making losses, am I right? Isn't that right? Hey! Right now, the best business is the real estate market. Some of my buddies have invested in it. I can connect you to them. Why are you so zoned out? Has anyone ever cheated you? Me? No one can do that to me. In case someone cheats me… I can put them in a big trouble! Whoever that is. Does he take me for a schmuck? I was just about to call you. The buyers of the apartment had called. What else do you want? My apartment, my business… and you want my wife as well? -Huh? What? -Shelby! You heard what I said, and you understood it as well! Don't act like you don't know anything. Yes, that idea was mine. But you messed everything up, you stupid-- Mind your language. I don't have anything to say to you right now. I called just to say that. Do you want my wife as well? She also feels the same, right? I'll make sure that both of you have nothing! Come forth and meet me, if you are a man! Face me like a man. I'll be right here. Come here. I know how to get it from you. Get it from me then. Do whatever you can and I'll show you what can I do! -Face me like a man. -I'm coming! He is coming now. I have asked him to come here. Did he think that I'm just a schmuck? Let him come. Let him come here. That dog! He wants my wife as well! Do whatever you want… but not here. Get going. You should be here. You should be here when he comes. Ask them to leave quickly or they would have to witness all that. Can I ask you something? Yes. It's from my house. Please keep quiet. -Hello! -When will you be home, Mom? Mommy will be a little late today. Didn't you tell me that you'll pick me up from school? I asked your dad to pick you up because I'm busy, right? When did you tell me that? You didn't tell me anything. I was going to tell you. The meeting and the discussion are still going on here. So, I'll be a little late. Ashwathy is with me. -She will drop me home. -Ashwathy? Please give her the phone. If you doubt me so much, come here and check. I'm with my boyfriend at an apartment. I don't doubt you. Hang up. Bye. Already I'm stressed, these problems don't end… and you're poking me amid all that? Oh! You're quite something. Is that how you talk to me now? Yes, I'm a wicked woman. Why are you snatching it? Why is he messaging you? What has he sent you? A girl's photo. It's a girl's photo. Not his photo, right? This is his fiancée. He must have sent it to ask for my opinion. You know his choices very well. Here. Go ahead and get him married. Don't be upset. Come here. I'll explain you. What are you going to say? You're cheating on your husband to see me, right? Why do you need someone else other than me? Haven't we fought the most for this reason? -Yes, but why are you misunderstanding it? -What do you mean? -Why did he message you? -He's my friend, right? What friend? What kind of friend? I was also your friend, right? -I was also your friend, right? -It's not the same. Delete it. I'll do it. Why not! What's wrong with her? -Delete it. -I'll delete it. That's all, right? -Delete it, right away. -I have deleted it. We've fought the most for this, right? Okay! -I'm deleting it. -Give it to me. -It's done. -No. What is this? It's a photo, right? Hereafter, this topic shouldn't be discussed between us. -What happened? -What the hell are you doing? What is it? If you're using me as an alibi when you are meeting that girl, shouldn't you inform me? -What happened? -She had called me. Asking me where you are and whom you're with. -And? -And what? I made up something. I can say something only if you inform me, right? Who was it? What happened? It's about a business deal. Hey! Your wife is calling. Answer it! -No. It's all right. -Talk to her. -Answer it! -Keep quiet. What is it? Where are you? What's the matter? I'm in a meeting. What meeting? First, tell me where you are. -Just hang up. I'll call you later. -Tell me where you are! Why are you venting out the anger on her? -Can't you talk properly? -No! I'm not angry. I got really worried when I got that call. There. She's calling again. Answer it and ask her what it is. Answer it! And talk properly. -What is it? -Didn't you hear me? -Tell me where you are. -I'm in a meeting. I'll call you later. What meeting? I know what your meeting is. Give the phone to the girl who's with you! -Which girl? -Don't you know who's with you? -Put her on the phone! -Who is with me? I know where you are, who you're with and what you're doing! -Don't interfere in unnecessary things. -Do you know where I am? I'm with the husband of that girl who's with you! I've told you a hundred times not to interfere in unnecessary things. I don't have any communication with that girl. She's living peacefully. Why did you have to meet her husband? -I'll tell him right now. -For me, she comes only after you. -Why do I have to keep her as my mistress? -Give the phone to her! If there's something, you should ask me first, right? Why should we fight because of that rascal? Can't you understand that? Don't talk unnecessarily. I don't want to hear anything about her. Hey! Hello? Hello? Hey! Hello? Hello? Oh, no! She hung up! I'm screwed. This will be a big problem. What will I do now? Hey! Where are you going? If you just wanted to fool around, you could have told me earlier. Why did you have to drag it so far? You can't make noise here. Your half an hour is over. Now, leave! I'm telling this to both of you after tolerating it as much as I could! Both of you should leave immediately. -I can't stay here any longer. -Don't say that. My wife found about this, and now, it is a big problem. I'm going crazy! I have to solve this. For that, I need to think. Give me some time. Just ten minutes. I'll leave after that. Please do whatever you want. But not here and I don't want to hear anything further! Both of you should leave now. What are you saying? Is this how you behave when someone is sharing his emotions? That is really cheap. Let him say whatever he wants to say. What will he have to say? His problem is his misconduct! He is married! Yet he's fooling around with random girls! Isn't that why she's creating an issue? Am I right? You know the circumstance under which I got married, and the problems I had after that, right? At some point, I met this girl and liked her. And I really like spending time with her. You may think that this is an extra-marital affair… but deep inside, I love her sincerely. I can't let her go. I need to talk to my wife, convince her and solve this problem. You should give me some time for that. This is about my survival. It's about your survival… why should I suffer because of that? Your wife! She has suffered for you so much! She has forgiven you so many times! Can't you adjust at least once? You mean, I haven't adjusted? I haven't adjusted for anyone? Tell me. I'll go home and talk to her as you asked. But she will ask me a lot of questions. I can't answer all that. That will lead to an argument and I will kill her. That's why I said, I need to think. Give me some time. -I'll leave after that. -Hey! That's a good idea. If you feel like killing her, you should. Isn't that right? What do you know? Why are you asking him to kill her? Do you know the problems he'll face once he does that? What problems? Do you know the state of mind of someone who has done that? And he wants to kill his wife! What are you saying? If he wants to do it, let him do it. Why are you objecting? Isn't that right? As for me, I'll do it. I'll definitely do it. You can die, kill or do whatever the hell you want to do. You should die as well! You can go and kill your wife! But you can't do any of that in my house. I don't have the time for it. So, stop troubling me and get out of here immediately. I was talking about killing my wife, right? Why does he have a problem with that? Were you going somewhere? No. I was just… stepping out. How come you visited without calling, Dad? I just thought I'll visit you. Come, sit down. Come. Deepthi is not here. I know that Deepthi is not here. How's your current business going on, son? It's okay. To be frank, I came here because she's not here. When she calls me, she doesn't tell me much… but she said something to her mother. And her mother got really anxious! Is there a problem between you and her? If she is at fault… I will talk to her. Is there a problem? Did she say anything like that? No. She didn't say anything. She never says anything. But still, I… Even if there's a problem… I'll solve it myself. That's good. If there's no problem between the two of you, why should I get worried? You were going somewhere, right? Shall I leave then? Don't mind me asking something else as well. Fights and arguments are common between married couples. But there is no domestic violence, right? Well, when there's a fight… I'm her husband, right? What's wrong in that-- If you think there's nothing wrong with that… then there shouldn't be anything wrong with this as well. I never liked you… but I agreed just because my daughter was adamant. That doesn't mean you can ruin her life. If you don't like her, just leave her. I'll find a new partner for her. That would make her happy as well. Just to make things better for you… do you need some financial help for your business? I'll lend you some money. Let them find a solution. Shall I leave? Hey! What happened? Why did he slap you? Where is she? -She's not here. -What do you mean? Where did she go? Today, she was screaming at me for no reason. I am worried about a lot of other things, right? And? Did you hit her? If you ask me about that… I would say that it wasn't deliberate. There's no point in saying all that. Once you hit a woman, everything will be against you. Don't you know that already? It's nothing like that. If you must hit her, you must. But don't let it become a habit. Tell me what's the matter. We were arguing… and I pushed her without realizing it. And? She hit her head and fell down. It wasn't intentional. She's my wife, right? Why would I do that? Where is she? What is all this? I can't be a part of this. Just because you had a problem with her, you killed her? Move aside! You've known her for so long! Yet you did that! I'm not staying here. Despite having such a grave problem on your mind, you were listening to my silly problems? I didn't do it on purpose. -Unknowingly-- -Hey! You guys can continue. I have a business meeting. Okay? What business? When he asked you to leave, you were whining like a little puppy, right? You're escaping when someone is in such a deep trouble? What kind of a man are you? What should we do? I don't know what I did! Not that! What should I do now? Shall I leave? Among other things, if I'm a part of a murder case as well, you know what my situation will be, right? I won't be able to survive. That's why. Shall I leave then? Get going. You idiot! Both of us will get screwed. Escape if you can. What kind of a friend are you? What? He gave you his room to fool around, while he was in deep trouble. Isn't that true? He has killed his own wife. I can't intervene in that. It's about my survival. What are you saying? Is he a criminal? Did he do it deliberately? No! Hey! Don't listen to anything this idiot is saying. If her dad had found out about this when he came here, would he have spared you? That's why I think we can't deal with this ourselves. Is he the sole reason for this problem? That man's daughter is also responsible, right? How? She must have said something that disturbed his peace of mind. In such a situation, anyone would end up killing their wife. Is there any husband who hasn't wished to kill his wife, at least once? Haven't you wished that? I've also wished that. But he did it. Now we should save him, right? How? Get lost! This problem doesn't have a solution. You can't escape from this. Even if you escape, do you think you can live peacefully? It's better to go to jail, than living like that, right? -Call the police. Let them come. -What? Why should he call the police? And you want them to arrest this innocent guy? -Is that what you're saying? -So, the police shouldn't know this? Why? There's no need for that. This is not uncommon. Yeah, right! Killing your wife is very common, right? Didn't I tell you guys? You can leave. I don't need your help or your solutions. I did all this myself, right? I'll deal with it myself. You can leave. Let him go if he wants to. I will be with you. You haven't done anything! No one will harm you! I won't let you go behind bars. No one has to do anything now. I know what to do. What are you going to do? Shelby will come now. Let him come. He killed your wife for money. You will be free. I will also be free. Isn't that right? And this guy! He's not going anywhere! Hey! This is not the time for your crazy acts! Anoop, come here. How long has it been since you killed her? I want to know if she'd bleed if I cut her. Hey! That's the doorbell. Someone is here. We're trapped! Hey! Didn't I tell you that we can't escape? We're trapped! I asked if I could leave, right? What do we do now? Tell me. What do we do? Tell me! I'll confess everything and become a police witness. Don't worry. It must be Shelby. Go and open the door. Bring him inside. Hey! Where are you going? Don't listen to him. What if it's not Shelby? Open the door anyway. If it's not Shelby… get rid of that person in a way that they don't suspect you. Go. We are right here! What are you looking for? No. It's nothing. Congrats. Why didn't you tell me you were going to the hospital? I would have accompanied you. Anoop, can't you do the dishes after having food? You should at least do that. Let me talk to the doctor anyway. What did my dad say when he visited? When did he visit here? When he called me, he told me that he came here and spoke to you. You forgot that as well? Why are you insulting me by telling your dad about our personal issues? Insult? What insult? Why do you have to feel that way? Did I lie to him? I had to tell my dad because you don't have time to listen to me. Why are you irritating me? If you want to say something, why can't you talk to me openly? Everything was okay when you came home, right? Then why are you behaving like this now? Isn't this the time to be happy? Get up! Let's celebrate! Come on! Come. Sit here. What's the matter? Tell me. This is the only way I can behave with you, Anoop. I… all those things are not leaving my mind. I wasn't like this, right? You're the one who made me like this. Me? I don't want to celebrate. It's true that we waited and went through a lot for this child. But now, I doubt if I even want it. What mistake did I do for you to want to get rid of our child? You still think that coming here with her when I was not home, wasn't wrong? Have you never felt, that relationship was wrong? In this room… in our room! How could you? And you're still cheating on me, right? I am cheating on you? Shall I ask you something? What did she give you, that I haven't given you? I want to know. Tell me. Are you in love with her? Did you give her your word? Tell me. Tell me. What are you saying? Friends go to each other's houses, right? Don't you go to your friends' houses? Don't they visit here? So as a friend, she came here, had a cup of tea and left. That's all. What else? I don't have any kind of communication with that girl now. What did I ask you? And what are you saying? That's what I told you. You won't understand my point. You're still talking about the past. Didn't we talk about this and arrive at a compromise? All that's fine. Give me your phone. Can you give me your phone? Phone! -Deepthi, I'll give you my phone. -Give it. You have to listen to me first. I'll listen to you, Anoop. First give me your phone. Deepthi, I'm telling you. Just listen to what I'm saying. Do you know how much I'm struggling? To make our life happy? Amid that, your blame games and questioning… I have even thought about committing suicide… because I can't handle all this pressure. Each question you're asking, is hurting me a lot. I can understand all that, Anoop. We can solve all of it. First, give me your phone. Deepthi, I'll give you the phone. First, please listen to what I'm saying. Anoop, why are you so scared to give me your phone? If I check it, I'll have the peace of mind. Just give it. Why should I be scared? First, listen to me! You're going on asking for the phone! If you don't believe me, check it! It's not the phone. What we need in life is mutual trust. What a performance! You need to be really thick-skinned to justify yourself by acting like this. What? If I open my heart, it's a performance! Whatever you're doing here is not a performance! Your dad is trying to find a new partner for you, right? I know who it is. Didn't you meet him after he became my partner? And now you don't need me. Damn Shelby! While you say things just to hurt me and win the argument, remember that I have to manage hundreds of things by myself. You don't know any of that. So, mind your words. How many foolish acts have you done? Losing all the money in the name of business. I told you so many times that we don't need that café business. Did you listen to me? You brought it to a state where we're about to lose our apartment. And you needed my father to bail you out! This cheap behavior of holding others responsible for your liabilities… is beyond my tolerance level! Responsibility, right? The biggest responsibility I took up in life is you! But you think that I'm a cheat! Now I've understood everything. You're creating all those problems using that poor girl to get rid of me, right? I'll leave you. I'll sign wherever you want me to sign. You can happily live with him! Anoop! I know that whatever you said about me so far, was to save your own skin. You know that very well. So, I'm not interested in talking about that. But I need to know something. This is the screenshot of a message you sent to Haritha. I have the call recordings as well. I just want to know something. The last message you sent her… why did you delete it? What was that message? If you've found out so much, find out that as well. Anoop, don't beat around the bush when I'm asking you a question! Do you think I am a fool? You better understand it! I'm asking this after knowing everything. I had read what that message was. You had read it as well. But I need to hear it from you. Tell me. What all have you sent her? "Were you satisfied?" What was she satisfied with? Have you ever asked me if I was satisfied? How can you be so sure that I've been satisfied? Tell me. You're doing all this for that girl who's sleeping with you, leaving her husband and the child behind! It's only disappointment for me… but for her, you're her lover. I can't be a part of this drama. So, tell me your decision. Where are you going? -Just move! -I won't move, Anoop. You can go after you tell me your decision. Move! I won't move. I want to know right now! Do you need her or me? Just say it and leave! -Tell me! Do you need her or me? -I don't have anything to tell you. If you've hacked my phone while I was sleeping, you won't even hesitate to kill me. I don't trust you anymore! How will I even sleep next to you? -Move! -No! I won't move. -Tell me and you can go wherever you want. -You are crazy! Hit me! Hit me and end my life! For living with you for so long, just hit me and end my life! You can kill me and then be with her. Just kill me! This is the least you can do for me as well as for her. You can't live without her, right? Should I call her now? Should I call her husband? Tell me! If my child and I are a liability then just kill us. Hit me and end my life. Damn it! Kill me! Are you okay, madam? Okay. I killed my husband. Sir!
