This is where you will stay. You took the train here. Greetings, gentlemen. Where is my bed? Over there. - How are you, brother? - Fine, you? Fine. Make yourself comfortable. How are the reserves? Only poverty and starvation. I met some officers who were recruiting workers. They said they were taking us to the compound and that it is the best way to find work in Johannesburg. Yes, but you're not a miner. You can't work in the mines. You must until your contract is up, then you go home. They told me to come here to find work. The city won't let you unless you have a permit from your village. So we all end up working in the mines. You can't just come here and start working. I can't just come and work? If you ask around, you will hear the same thing. You are wanted outside. See you later, brother. Tie the rope on this side. Hold the pipe and keep it still. Hold the shovel together. Then throw the stones away. Start with the pick. Finish with the shovel! Do the job... I'm trying to get a permit to work off the compound in Johannesburg. I want to work in Johannesburg. You won't find work in Johannesburg. You're a miner now. You go home when your contract's up. Home? What if we talked to the supervisor? - Supervisor? - Yes, maybe he can help. Let's go find him. - Can I wait here? - Yes, stay here. - Greetings. - How are you, boy? - Fine, and you, sir? - Fine. How can I help you? I need a permit to work off the mine compound. What do I need to do? It's hard. There are many kinds of permits. You need one to work and one to reside in Johannesburg. That is the law, you need all these documents. What exactly can you do for me? Honestly, my boy, there is nothing I can do, you'll soon see that. It's my pleasure to meet you, I'm from Kwa-Zulu, too. I could tell you were. I work for the Mthombeni's. I saw talking boxes there. Do you know what they are? Boxes with things in it. - What kind of things? - It makes white people seem nice. I will be leaving my job soon. The woman doesn't treat me well. Don't quit, keep working there. No one treats us well. Greetings, my brothers. - Are you new here? - Yes, I work upstairs. - My name is Moloi. - I'm Mgabi. I was saying how hard my job is. My employer treats me badly. If it gets too bad, come find me. I can be very helpful. - Are these the two Kaffirs? - It's them. What did you do with the car you took away this morning? - Good afternoon, Auntie. - My children! - How are you? - Fine. - And how are you? - Fine. Where have you been? Working. Really? Can you help me find accommodations? - Do you have a permit? - No. - What is a permit? - It lets you stay here. Auntie, help me find a room. There are rooms over there that recently opened up. Have the people moved out? Yes, they went to live nearby. Since you know them, you could show us. All right, I'll go with you. If you like it, you can pay for it. - Let's go, it's not far. - Thanks. She's crazy. When the sun sets, and the cattle come back I think of you. The sun sets and the moon rises on the horizon of the sea. When the birds come back and the sun sets. And I went looking for you in the houses and streets and even in the hospitals and jails. I will look for you until I find you. When the sun sets and the cattle come back, I think about you. When the sun sets. I love my baby even if he drinks too much. I love him, I love him. He left home to go to Cape Town There he met his ruin. I love my baby even if he drinks too much. My baby is my baby and I like him even if he drinks too much. Don't say a word, Mother. He's my baby. He's my baby. He was fine when he left Johannesburg but when he got to Cape Town he met his ruin. He's my baby even though he drinks too much. He's the one I love. He works for me. Leave my baby alone, Mother. He works for me. Leave my baby alone. Good morning. - What? - My friend needs work. Go and ask the engineer over there. Who are you? What are you doing here? This is my husband. This is my wife. Take him outside. - Where's your permit? - I don't know. Come with me. I'm coming, I just want to check her out. - What's wrong, angel? - Don't touch me. Things are just fine. My husband will come back. Don't worry, I'll take care of you. Come now, you can't do that. We have more work to do. Come on. It's just a little fun. The police came last night and arrested Zachariah. They did? When? At dawn. They came in when I was sleeping. I don't know what to do. Nothing will happen to him. Will they sentence him to hard labor? - Don't worry. - What will happen to him? Nothing will happen, he'll come home.
