Go. Anis, what are you doing? Stop the car. Stop the car. Come on stop. Stop, don't do shit. Stop. It is useless, nothing will be the same. I was trying to save our relationship. And a boy can cause us a crisis? I do not fuck. But put him on the street. As for both of you are shit, Maybe if we were asked to each other. No, you're not a shit, you are someone who can afford to be nice. Give with one hand and with the other strip. Just put another person in the street I have to work. Everything is in your hands. If you want, we move. We walk from here. Who cares about work? Find another. You just have to desire it. I don't want anything else. You were against, but he was scared and needed to go. I'd like to help you, I didn't want to discuss about it. I knew it was difficult, it would be tough, but it is better than nothing. Why not think about it? Mistakes are made even, but this time we can do it better. You want to throw everything to lose? Translation: Liana
