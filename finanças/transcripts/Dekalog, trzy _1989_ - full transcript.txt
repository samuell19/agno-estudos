It's the Christmas Eve "Tell me, what do you want?" Edward's missing What? He's gone Ewa... Went out in the morning and never come back We've got to find him It's the Christmas Eve I'm sorry Ewa... "All right, I'll go with you" What have you told your wife? That someone was trying to steal the car Let me have the keys Join me behind the corner It's been stolen Somebody's seen it in Wislostrada street You call the police ...and I'll try to catch a taxi Is it worth your while? "The car earns our living, doesn't it?" We attended the midnight mass "No, I didn't" I saw you there "Ah, all right, let's forget it" I've checked everywhere "...with friends, with the police..." Where to? Where would you go if your wife disappeared? "I don't know, to the hospital?" ...the emergency department The emergency service's in Banacha street tonight "Do you have emergency service tonight, Doctor?" "Not today, yesterday" I've made a mistake What about today? Which hospital has? Whom are you trying to find? A husband "No, mine" "That you, Jurek?" Do you happen to have a patient... His name? By the name of Garus? Thirty-eight "Yes, Garus, thirty-eight" "No, there's a female here..." looking for her husband When was he brought to you? When did he leave home? At noon It doesn't seem to be him "He left home at noon, yeah" "They have a casualty," no legs no papers But that was before eleven The Prague hospital Shall I put the light off? "No, thanks, I'm on duty" It's his car And his scarf I'll leave it here He might be cold when he's back He can hardly be back if he has no legs any more "You'd better leave a sandwich for him, too" He might be hungry when he's back "Go on, it's very funny" "Gladly," "Why don't we go to bed together," in a hotel? And then you could call him to tell him the number of our room I... I didn't call him You wanted to be through with me and to go home And to be left in peace I didn't call him He told me "You didn't say who was calling," I admit "Ewa," "I didn't call him, believe me" I'm not. Nothing to choose between all of you "O.K., forget it" "Take me to the Prague hospital, please" The fellow with his legs cut off "Ewa... There, there, Ewa..." "No, let me have a look" It isn't him I'd like it to be him... or you... Many a time I imagined... "both of you run over by a truck," the face squashed by the tires I once saw you in my dream Your neck was broken I could see your tongue protruding I just looked at you - and laughed I wonder who's had a spite against this one here Who's going to be glad It's the police So what? You're driving a stolen car Did you call them? Hold on "Hey, Andrzej" This is that stolen car They're following us Got any papers? Yes Then you'd better slow down Drive slowly Get out of the car Put your hands on the roof "All right, this your car, Mister?" This car's been reported stolen We've only just found it Abandoned in Wislostrada street Had a drink? I haven't had the time "Like driving fast, eh?" You're lucky it's the Christmas Eve tonight He was right I was driving too fast You could have wrecked the car and killed me and yourself Shall we have another try? Do you want it? Fasten the belts Got enough? We were to go home All right Your car isn't here Are you getting out? He couldn't have left the car before noon Why? It was snowing in the afternoon But the car had no snow on it "You know, I mean that snow cap" It started snowing at five pm "Well, I don't know" I say... What if he's at home? We shouldn't go in together Wait here "If he isn't there," I'll come out to the balcony "If I don't come out in five minutes," drive home. Ewa... In case he's there Good-bye Emergency service There's been an accident A man has fainted He's lying at the bus stop "May I have the address, please?" It's at the corner of Pulawsah and "Walbrzyska streets, the city way" Perhaps he's drunk? "No, he's sober" We have his papers His name? Edward Garus Born in 1949... "Your name, please?" Anna Tatarkiewiez He isn't there "Like I told you, he isn't" Why don't you take off your coat? "I'd rather not, I'm freezing" Want some tea? Yeah I didn't phone Edward that night "three years ago, it's nonsense to say I did" That was important to me You were important "If you really want to know," I loved you And I wanted... to change everything "When we were getting dressed," and he was standing there with his back to us... You didn't even look at me once I took you by the hand But you tore yourself away "Then he said," now that we're both dressed "You can choose, you can stay or go" And added he was going And you followed him without a word "Yes, it was like that?" Yeah Edward made still another condition "I could follow him," if I would never meet you again Yes... And you said I have no intention to see him "And then I answered, all right" That's how it happened? Give me your hand The poor boy whom nobody loved or understood You're right It was all my fault "But you seem to have landed well," don't you? "You're the same as before, aren't you?" You went as it hammer and tongs to straighten things "You're a good husband and father," you provided well for your family And you never forget to collect the laundry Let me go I'll be glad to your hands stink of petrol Did you ever think what happened after we left that hotel? How I was feeling? What I felt when we watched some love story on TV ...and he looked at me all the time instead of the screen? I never made love to him since that night What are you doing? Nothing special... washing my hands It's the Christmas Eve I'm sorry I lied to you "I do sleep with him, quite normally" The same to you All the best To us It's him At the wrong moment again "Baby Jesus, sleep" Sleep now Mother is soothing your cries... How about the second verse? This is all we know Special night rates "Thank you, merry Christmas" Has he grown a beard? "I mean, Edward?" "No, not at all..." We're breaking the wafer as if here forgetting what we're really doing Let's go Where to? The emergency service or the rail way station "Yes, the railway station" "Just a second longer, O.K.?" Is this the emergency service? Could you tell me if a Mr. Garus has been brought to you? Edward Garus Born 1949... "Ah, I see, and do you receive" notifications from all over Warsaw? A notification? Where was it? And? Thank you very much "I phoned the emergency service," there's been a notification A notification? "Yes, somebody reported him lying, when the" "ambulance arrived, he wasn't there anymore" "He wasn't there, that's all" They say it's usually like that with drunks They told me to check at the sobering-up station Where's my home? Where is it? "Let me see, Garus..." A Jew? No "We had a Garus once, back in 1979" He was a Jew Do you have cards with particulars of all your patients? "Yes, perhaps he's one of those" who's been brought in today Better have a look at them "Ah, they've gone to sleep" Just look at them dancing What about this one? Or that one? Stop it! "Stop it, will you!" Can't you see they're cold? "You deserve to be pun in there, you bum?" Stop! Just try "Come on, try it!" "Let's dance, come on!" It doesn't make any sense to go on looking I'm going home Where shall I take you? I wrecked you car And ruined your Christmas Eve "Not at all, it was very nice" Come with me... "to the railway station, please" Are you on duty at the TV sets? Yes I keep falling asleep That's why I'm skating We're looking for... Has there been an accident perhaps? No Do you remember a man wearing a short sheep skin coat? A jacket actually? He comes here quite often Never goes anywhere Who's this man? Edward And the woman? His wife And these are his children He's living in Crakow For nearly three years now For three years? Nearly... I lied a lot tonight But why? I don't know Do you know a game? You say to yourself If the person who appears from behind "the corner is a man, I'll be lucky" "If it's woman," it means bad luck I know it I played that game tonight I said to myself If I manage to spend the whole night "with you, till seven in the morning" no matter how... What then? Then everything is going to be all right What if you failed? I've made preparations I live alone It's so very hard to be alone... on a night like this People just... "Yeah, they lock themselves in," curtain the windows Exactly "Going to the midnight mass tonight," I saw a boy He slipped away from the hospital Still wearing his pajamas... What happened to him? They got him I know... it wasn't you who phoned that night Be seeing you "They're all asleep, aren't they?" The car's been found I know I phoned during the night Was it Ewa? Yes Are you going to spend the evening away from home like before? No "No, I'm not" I'll be here
