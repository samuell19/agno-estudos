I'm going to smoke a cigarette boss. Yes. So this machine has to increase production from 200 to 250 an hour, okay? Boss! In you opinion when do the new times come into play? - Immediately. Who says? - The machines said it, and I decide it. Well we're not happy with that Before fixing new times you have to tell us how much we're pocketing First you work, then the management decides No no, no management. We have to discuss this immediately. You want to increase production. Then increase our salaries as well In any case all those who have left their work posts are fined Look here. We're not in prison you know? You have to learn to discuss with us. We have to discuss! Everyone fined! What's he doing? He's putting his hands on me! You will end badly. Ass-Kisser!

Even if it there is no use. Every piece is a hole Every hole is a piece. Just don't fall in the hole To not fall this this hole, think of the girls bum How to concentrate? It's all a matter of technique. I concentrate with my brain... and think of the girls bum A piece, a bum a piece, a bum Piece, bum, I think I?m an ass-Kisser -Not with me. Why d'you say this? - An ass-Kisser is one who is a slave of his boss. Who knows his boss?

The three united unions call you to fight! Against the rhythms, against politics To fight for health and to earn more money And to have more time to be with your children and wives When you made 1000 pieces a day they gave you 300 lire Now you make 3000 with the new times and the piecework has remained the same This means for them an increase in profits of millions Whilst for you only the prices increase Everything is more expensive except out labor which they get for free Piecework should be paid more! More pieces, more money! [Another voice] less pieces, more money, less work! Workers! Workers! Impose on the unions a revolutionary platform! Piecework is non-Contractable! It must be abolished! The factory is a prison, and from prison there is escape! Lets fix our feet to the ground, our aim is to improve the piecework contract! Let's show the owners our strength!

Break your spine... you'll break your spine because I?m not doing piecework... They'd have to break their spines to keep up with me... - Massa The life of a man is the only one...

Armando, what you doing? - Hi daddy, I?m drawing 'Even you didn't know that daddy lost his finger? - Let me see! Here you go! - Dear dear!! So that guy didn't say anything? - I didn't want to worry everyone Yes, he's right -What sort of reasoning is that? A guy loses his finger... seems important that at least his son should know, at least... no? The finger of a father, for the son, is always the finger of a father Yes, but you should also have other things to worry about Even with 9 fingers a father should have money for his son Unless someone is interested in twisting the truth... I?m going out Where you going daddy? I'm going for a moment to the branch... - Come back soon please Shouldn't he have called him uncle? - It just comes out like that... spontaneously Spontaneous?

What's the food like? - Like the food in the factory Only that at night they don't let me leave But where do you want to go? - To the cafe' Coffee with the comrades... by the way, do they still talk about me the comrades? They do they do... you're still a symbol -I don't believe it I'm an asshole... - They talk about you, they do... you're still a symbol So they talk... they talk badly of me, because... there is always the "but" What is this "but"? - "But" means that... they talk well but when the discussion is over they add a "but" And so down to destroy... they say... Listen. Listen... you promise you won't get pissed off like last time? And why should I get pissed off? - I'm just asking you something... talk, talk... how did you... I mean... how did you realize you were going crazy? ' It is others who decide when one should become mad... but... but to tell you the truth, I arrived before them, I fooled them... I already had my suspicions Suspicion is like a nervous fox, sour, bitchy, villainous, reactionary Every so often some strangeness would come out... - What strangeness was it? At the table... when one eats... the cutlery... has to be all nice and straight, in line, you know, like soldiers I was at the table, eating, and in that moment dreaming of being in the factory I knew that, I knew it... - You would like to know... What the hell we produce in the factory? - This I know, I know this Even those piece they make in their millions? No no! I know, I know... I make these piece... that are necessary for a motor this motor... and this motor then ends up in another machine which isn't there, it isn't there... ah, it's not there? - No Imagine that one day, I met the engineer... I grabbed him by the collar and I said "what the hell are we making in this factory... what the hell are these shits for?" Look I?m going to kill, I?ll kill you! - Look I?m going to call the nurse! Be good, we're here to reason, why d'you come out with this stuff? I reason but... heh... if they didn't take him away I would really have strangled him But this Lulu is not madness because a man, a man had the right to know what he's doing What it's for Yes or no? Am I right? Yes yes -You seem them? You see all those over there? They were all workers, peasants... manual laborers, builders, policemen... lawyers, drivers, mechanics of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, categories even of 6th, 8th and 16th The real crazies are not here, they're hidden in private clinics... and of course, it's understandable... just imagine if people realized that even the rich go crazy! It would make them cry, wouldn?t it? They're crazy those guys, leave it alone, don't get involved Lulu, it's the money, it all starts there... we're part of the same group... owners and slaves We become mad because we have too little, and they because they have too much And so, in this hell, on this planet full of hospitals, lunatic-Asylums... cemeteries, factories... barracks and buses... The brain slowly slowly... runs away It goes on strike... on strike... see you later Have a nice stay -Thank you Strike, strike, strike... hey, where you going? Away! Actually it's me who has to leave... - Oh yes, I always get it wrong. Bye! Lulu! When they admit you... bring weapons Comrades. Management has suspended 6 workers following the agitation born from your indignation... of the accident received by Massa, victim of the work rhythms But we will be clear to the directors and owners of the factory That if they don't remove their suspensions we will... united, I mean united! We will shift our struggle to a tougher level Workers! To the violence of owners, we reply with the violence of workers! [Another] to violence of owners, we respond with the unity of unions... [another] who pays those guys? Union unity! Union unity! Down with the owners! Always with these damn things in the ear... I have to ask for some information Who are those who were suspended? Me first of all... - Yeah but apart from you - De Simoni, De Antoni, Delori... And all these guys supposedly acted the heroes because of my finger? - Yes for you. For you, for your finger... not for your finger! For the class war! Owners are more arrogant... - But why didn't they suspend you? Because he's a "straighty"' They know I?m good at my work. Owners! Bourgeoisie! Only a few months left! Union unity! Union unity! Good morning workers! The director wishes you good work In your interest, treat the machine you have been given with love Take care of it... security measures suggested by the factory guarantee your safety Your health depends on your relationship with your machine Respect its needs... and don't forget that a machine in condition equals a productive one Good work! Hi Piero! Hey how?s it going? Hey Lulu! Finally! - I lost my finger. From when that disgrace happened to you production has gone down 7% 7% it went down! Here we have to do like before... we have to find that spirit of collaboration between you... which had made our factory a jewel! A jewel! ' In which the interests of the workers and capital combined! I say this for you, I am a worker like you' What d'you think I get in my pockets? We want to destroy everything for a stupid discussion on the timings of piecework No no no, and no. I guarantee we are not going back! For four poor guys who we suspended, we are not going back... even if it means paying, I tell you... you agree? You Lulu are with us aren't you? "Militina" says hi -Okay, and good work! - To work! To work! Your under the average. Your rhythm is below 80 Sorry Mr. Stop-Watch, but I time myself according to my speed of masturbation You understand? Work "terrone" if you don't want to return to living amongst pigs -Shut up! [Singing] love, love is beautiful!!! [Singing in dialect] My love my love my love... fuck love...! At night I sleep... Lulu how is your finger? [Something in dialect, possibly:] really great... come on! Work! Work! What shall I do? ' Leech! Obey the boss, you have to check me... Lulu! What are you doing? Your output is very low You have to make an effort, otherwise you'll lose the piecework (bonus). Understood? Maybe in these few days of holiday you became rusty? Rusted my penis! Look here, look at this stuff, look! What did you think leech? It's not that I can't... it's that I don't want to! I have other thoughts in my head But the times you're doing is like kids would do. - Kids? Yeah, kids who go to school... Its all a fake that... what you don't think we're treated like kids who go to nursery school? In fact, who go to the house of correction Look that if you continue like this, not only do you lose the bonus but you go under the average and I have to fine you Oh yes the fine! The fine! I was forgetting about the fine! Why don't you just fine me! Come on fine me! But then you'll have to give me back everything you stole from me when I worked before... you'll have to shit everything out! Even the finger! What is this? A pipe And this? - A trumpet And this one? - A calendar, and that?s a protractor and a flower-Pot These pens... always in disorder... why you laughing? Because I?m happy you see... I?m happy How's it going with the finger? - The finger is no longer there Do you feel less crazy? What d'you think I care... finger more or finger less... think about this carefully... what does this finger make you think of? - "Luzelle" No. The penis! - You allude to the male organ? Just that! If we want to follow this through... you feel that finger is as if you were castrated Look that since the accident my rhythm has increased... I do it even 3 times a night Listen, joking apart... what d'you think of me, what have they told you? I have always like women... I?m normal, like all the others... if I separated from my wife, it's because of questions of character With Lydia, the hairdresser, she attracts me just like the first time... we care for each other And she's the sort of woman who would split herself into 4 piece for me. And we even have some saved money, just imagine! You like money? - Of course And yet since the accident you show clear signs of problems towards work and therefore towards money Why? - Yes exactly, why? [Sign: Impartial] It's red, let yourself get searched... - But I don't rob oh come on, the "impartial" decides not us The search Massa! Come on! - Take your hands off me! Worker! Don't let yourself get searched! Violence in labor follows you everywhere! ...your body and you mind! - What are you saying!? What are you saying!? They think you are the thieves, but they are the thieves! We have to perceive where they hide their profits, created with your blood! With your lives, with your work, don't let them search your bodies! ...and your minds! And now where are you going? To spend your free time? And how do you spend it? In front of the television? Or talking about football? About Juventus... you have to phone Daniele and make decisions... eh? Or maybe time passes and your wife come home... and what do you tell her? Or maybe you go and work another job, because the money your boss gives you isn't enough? Damn you! Damn you! Why do you get angry with me? Get angry with the directors! If you're so strong, get angry with them! Pick on a work-Mate! Tomorrow morning, when you go back to work, pick on a director if you're brave enough! Comrade, come on! Come on! I'll break you! You have to forget it! Go to your dad go! Join us instead of faking! Lulu? What is this, life? This is life? Stop it and go away! - Let him pass! Slave, slave! 8 hours of work and on Sunday the football game! Shame! Shame on you! You only know how to do this? You're only capable of doing this! You're a slave and nothing else! You understand!? So. Here until now only the negative aspect of piecework has been spoken about But my dear comrades, the 20,000 lire of piecework... I?ll throw them in the bag I think the piecework is important, I mean... when we open up the bag and there?s 20,000 lire in there, what's the problem? [General yelling] fuck off! We're fed up of hearing good things about piecework whilst they exploit us! We're fed up of this, let's vote! I'm for the piecework but negotiated down to the last penny... I mean, to obtain the maximum possible... listen! Listen! I repeat... for who hasn't understood, or has just arrived... who is in favor of the immediate abolishment of piecework raise your hand! 1, 2, 3, 4... 1212 votes, 12 votes! One moment! One moment! Slaves! Slaves! Slaves! Who is for an reasoned fight that leads us to negotiate Through a representative. Piecework, moment by moment, situation by situation Raise your hand! Wait! Listen! I propose something... this: Who is in favor of striking to the end, raise your hand! 1, 2, 3, 4... 12 Now we vote on another proposal. Who is in favor of a reasoned action... that beginning on Monday, for two hours a day, we strike... raise you hand! This is the answer to provocations... because it's the majority that decides, democratically, you understand back there? We created these assemblies by fighting and now you sabotage them! No, no... let him talk please... it's you, all your fault and the piecework that I got ill! You don't think about the conditions over there... the humidity! Go and try! Now I?m going up to talk! - Go Massa! I don't know what to call you... workmen, comrades, workers... I don't know Stop it! Come here and talk into the microphone, come here! Just to talk for a moment... the student, the student outside said that we come in when it's dark, and leave when it's dark What sort of life is ours? Whilst we're at it, why don't we double the piecework? Eh? Then we can work on Sunday too, maybe we could work throughout the night... actually maybe we could bring in our children and wives We force the children to work, whilst our wives stuff a sandwich in our mouths And we just go on and on without a break, onwards! Onwards! Onwards for these 4 damn lire, until we die! And so from this hell... always with no break... we pass directly to the other hell! Listen to me carefully Massa, you who talk so much now... where were you when we all with the comrades of the unions created the union in this factory, of the B.A.N.? Eh? Answer? Where was I? I was a piecework laborer. I followed the politics of the unionists, I worked for productivity, I increased output, increased it! Hurray! You're right! 'And now? And now what have I become? I've become a beast, a beast... you are a beast, not us! The student outside says... he says That we are like machines! Understood? That I am a machine! I am a nut, I am a screw, I am a transmission belt, I am a pump! But for me, my pump is broken, I don't have it anymore, and there's no way of fixing it now I propose this: To immediately leave work, everyone! And who doesn't immediately leave work now, is a scoundrel! Is a shit-Face! Massa! Wait', listen to me... The breaking of union unity, which with great effort we conquered... - Re-Enters the political game that the owners play... we have to be all united If we really want to win An extremist and adventurist politics, would dissolve itself... therefore try to understand! Comrade Massa! Let's try to all understand, we have to remain united! United! Look at the tramps how they run! They wait for the workers! The shit-Faced workers! Go and have fun, you who have money! Waiting for the workers, look how they run! How did it go? - I said what I had to... a few concepts They're still going in those guys! Come on! Let's go to the other side! Losers! Fascists! Coward! Ass-Kisser!! At what time does this shift end? - Now! Let's go! To the gates! To the gates! Here we are. Look at this stuff. There's nothing here. This was a place where I worked. Building frames. Empty now. The owner is in prison. For fraudulent bankruptcy. Here we are. We'll stop here, put on the heating- -But I?m cold! Listen is it really your first time? - Well... let's not waste time, we'll strip, put our clothes back there... \ Come on, we're well here... but how does one do this... I?m scared -Scared? Come on... but you'll hurt me... - No, let me guide you You're not going to hurt me? - No, I won't do anything... come on... I won't hurt you If I feel bad you'll help me? - Put them behind... wait wait... I haven't taken anything off. I have to take everything off... trousers... hey! I have a mini-Bar here! I'm a teetotaler. I don't drink... I?m scared... scared of what? Throw it down, throw it down!

There's no need to insult You should pay your Lulu for this nice maneuver he made for himself Reality is reality... there's nothing else. [Sign: Every hour is an hour of our life] Comrades, your assembly has decided on 2 hours of strikes For the regularization of the piecework. The three united unions invite you to not attempt provocations... workers! 2 hours of striking are not enough to resolve the problem of piecework! - Come! Workers! Don't let yourselves be fooled! No, no, no! Enough of these provocations! Why all these police? It's a peaceful strike of only two hours! - Calm down, calm down... we have to guarantee the freedom of the worker! Workers, comrades! Do not accept provocations. Calm down! Neither from the police nor from the extremists! Workers! They have called the police... we have to remain united! Workers! Follow the example of your comrades that are here with us! Two hours of striking are useless! Better to stay outside all day and night! Rather than working at the factory! For 36,000 lire a month, I pay it with my life! What are your intentions? - Today no one goes in. Not even the directors But the police is around. What are we supposed to do? - The police is always around. And if it isn't, there's always some loser who calls them... - Of course! The factory works when we are inside. But if we are outside, why would the directors go inside? Yes ok. Ok. But for us, the moment hasn't arrived Neither here nor anywhere to create a confrontation! For you there has never been a moment for a confrontation, neither with the owners nor with the police! Listen listen... as if I still haven't understood you... we will continue to strike for two hours a day until we get what we demand, is that clear!? In the assembly we decided on two hours, not a revolution! Two hours of strikes! And which side are you on? Calm, calm... today the directors will not enter! Let's go. Form the picket-Lines up here! Comrades! The committee of worker-Students calls you to fight for the abolition of piecework! No one must go into the factory, not even the directors! Outside, outside in the cold with us. These directors who scientifically organize your exploitation. Comrade-Workers! Picket-Lines are the strength of the working-Class! The expression of class discipline! Everyone must be in the picket-Lines The other scoundrels must fight against the strength of united unions! Let them get out of their cars! Make way, make way... let them pass! Let us know who you are! Let me show us their faces! My god! These guys will get on! I hate... hate violence! Workers! United! Let's not let anyone pass! Where you going? Where you going!? It's dangerous... get down! Get down! I'll pull off your ear! What are you going to do? What you going to do in there? - No, not the ears! Give me the microphone... tell everyone what you're going to do in there! - I'm not going!! What d'you mean your not going? - Inside... You're not going inside... so you stay here... stay here... here with us... he's not going inside Come on... let's pull him up... tell the others you're not going inside! Go back! Back... back! Calm... stay calm... I say this for you... good morning engineer... there's a bit of disorder here, a workers strike, you go ahead... we'll take care of everything... stop! Go away! Where you going engineer!? Where you going? Don't take me with you! Help! Help! Come on! I'm an employee... I have nothing to do with this! Yes? - It's me. Are you alone? - With who should I be?

I was missing something... ah... at least we meet people - Yes, what nice faces we see If you were head how I talk... you won't understand a word! I'm missing the clip... - Which one's that? - The one with the dog. There it is. They're fugitives. - You brought them to not be alone in the house with me. Let's not let them recognize us... and take this stuff off your head. Come on. Come over there. Who is it? - It's me. Come in! - Hey there... we're so hungry here... the engineer collapsed and they took him to a doctor... all the newspapers are talking about it! Where is the kitchen? 8 wounded among the police... we had 20 hurt You going to make a sandwich there? Hey! You were photographed! What do they say about this in the city? The unionists are isolated... beaten! Lydia... be good... I forgot to tell you that these fugitives will sleep here for two or three nights... hey let me see! - Yes, sorry, there's the televisions Are there any eggs? - No, there are none left. The theory is correct. The struggle against the whole. If we had a strong revolutionary party, we would reach the critical point within a few months... the workers are ready for power... forget the piecework The workers? The workers? This guy is totally incapable! I know workers... forget communism... listen... go across the road and borrow a few eggs... be good -No! You go and get them yourself, there's your communism... - What's communism go to do with it? Of course it's got something to do. Because after you will behave like that -The eggs! When you go to Rome to govern, what will you do? What will you do!? We'll get rid of all the bosses no? Obviously! What would you be without a boss? A starving wreck! And instead look, they've given us everything... you have security with bosses... what are you saying? What are you talking about? Let her talk no? She cuts out the pictures of Agnelli, she does! Why doesn't she talk? Here's you freedom and liberty... I?ll talk, because anyway I?ll never become a communist! Never! Because I?m for freedom, you understand! And I like mink, I like it, and one day I?ll have it, because I deserve it, you understand? Because I work! I've worked since 12 and I deserve it because I?m good... poor Arturo! - Arturo! Go Arturo! Go with you mum who'll make a fur coat for you too! Agnelli will make you a mink coat... to think that even she is exploited! Poor girl! It's just amazing... exactly the sort of contradictions that explode in this sort of family! The average proletarian is exploited in factory but he models himself on the examples given to him on the television... newspapers... cinema... - Of course, of course... he lives in misery but always imitating his exploiter Mummy, why are we leaving? What d'you want to do? What d'you want to do now? No no, stay put! Put this stuff back. Put it back! Then you pay me back for all the times I?ve forgiven you Look, I?ll get the fur-Coat for you -You jacket Arturo! Stop it! - I didn't say a word... tell your mother! What did I say? What did I say? Did I say anything? Stop it! I can't take it anymore! Stay here with us. Even the students are here! Stay here... - Arturo come with me! He's not your father that guy... you idiot! No, not the kid! Not the kid! Go with you mother... come on... with done enough embarrassing things in here -What you crying about? Lulu just pretends to care about you. Don't you remember the slaps he gave you? Stop it! She's not gone to call anyone! - I think that girl went to call the police! She votes for the Christian democrats but she?s good... please... listen... you tell him... no... come on! Don't get offended Lulu... we'll see you later Lulu... it is 7:45... go back to work calmly... but remember, watch out for provocations and don't play the owners' game There will be a workers assembly in the canteen with the three united unions... thank you! Watch out for provocations! Don't accept the unionist blackmail The unionists are the slaves of the owners! They are reformists! To the violence of the owners, respond with revolutionary violence! Sabotage production and refuse to work! Workers! Don't let yourselves be insulted! Massa, you can't come in... - What d'you mean can't come in? Just wait a moment... There is a letter for you. - What letter? Why can't I come in? They're not letting me in! There! You see what happens with your extremism? You have to get in the middle of the road! A worker is not a daddy's boy! Enough! I won't do anything... stay calm... - Lulu! You see? I've lost my job! First they run me over, then they fire me! They want me dead! Strike! Strike comrade-Workers! Let's go on strike! To the assembly! - Wait for us Massa! This one they will pay for... let's have an assembly! ...but a worker like me? Where do I go? Where are we going? Eh? Are we going to school? To the theatre? To the cemetery? To our mums? Where do we go? Where? Where!? Where is the little one with the beard? - At the "pizacar" school what d'you mean at the pizacar? I lost my job! Lulu! Lulu! Who made you do it!? Come on! Your brain turned upside-Down! Who made you do it? And to think you were the engineers favorite! Have you gone mad? Go away! Go away! Stay calm Lulu! Go home a sleep! Go on Lulu! Massa! Massa! Listen. The assembly is long and tough... listen... don't get discouraged... - Tell me the truth! At the exit. Wait for me at the exit. Stay calm. At the exit Massa! At the exit? What's the result? Is it good? Listen Lulu. The assembly has rejected the proposal of a long-Term strike Now we will try again? - Rejected it?! We will return and try again, listen to the workers... maybe trying again they will be convinced... the assembly has decided to not leave the current plan of struggle - You understand? I knew it, I knew it... - You know what they're like. You see Lulu, the situation is about adjusting the piecework... here it's not about making a revolution... you are always doing somersaults Look that each time we go on strike, it's not only the owner who losses out it's also us who don't bring home any money... you understand?! The money! Look, the 10,000 lire for maintaining the kid, I?ll give it to you now! And give the kid this letter... he'll frame it... damn it! They rejected me... You can't keep them... he needs them. Go and give him them! - Lulu?! Lulu. I assure you that the unions will defend you to the end. I don't care. - But you be careful. Help us. Try and understand -What do I care? Isolation is ugly Lulu... be careful... now I have to go inside... stay calm. This is an occupied school! At this moment students discuss the essential problems of their life! They discuss politics. Parents are asked to leave and return to their houses! To watch television! - Excuse me! Excuse me! He knows me. I'm the guy from the B.A.N. I lost my job, my finger... you remember? Where do I go? - Over there! Why do you let him pass? Why can he pass? Would you be students as well? - We are Sicilian immigrants. Look at him... look at him over there... hey it's me Lulu... it's me. You heard that I lost my job? - I know, I know... I know, I know... you're here sleeping. But this morning you could have come over there... we can't be everywhere But at least you? - I do what I can... there are still few of us. Yesterday we were in the offices. Today in the schools. And tomorrow maybe we'll be down there... yes... Yes... In the lunatic-Asylum with militina... we try, with our work, to make the contradictions explode. To change this way of life... - But you've changed me 'cause I lost my job. It's because whilst you obey your boss no one touches you... then you become aware and your fucked. But this you already knew, didn't you Lulu? It's not new to you. I'm not stupid. Even I know how things stand, even I do. Leave now! - Why? Let's go with these students in front of the factory no? We are divided, and we are few. - Few? I have to eat, eat! You understand? - You should know that one always finds food. I don't what charity eh... imagine I never said anything. Look, I?ll just pedal... indifferent Yours is an individual case, a personal case, and this is not what interests us. We want a class-Based story... you want a personal story? You want mine? What do I care about a personal story? Look me in the face. I'm 30 years old. Look at my condition! Don't shout! - I've only done three exams, I?m sick with pyorrhoea I got factory-Intoxicated... - And I have pyorrhoea ok? Massa where were you? - Where have you popped out of? We were waiting for you What do I have to do now? - What do I care what you have to do? Do whatever you like. There are a thousand ways to live. Try to change. Try to change! To not live as you were used to. Stay here with us. Now you're unemployed you can do what you like. Anyway, something to eat is always found. If you feel like it, you can even be a full-Time activist. Listen... don't try and be funny. Keep your hands down! Massa you will be hired again! I've taken decisions that... I know what I have to do for myself... goodbye and best wishes again! Massa why don't you stay here? - You are a student. Yes it's true, I?m a student - In the evenings... - You are a student! Of course! I work and I pay for my studies! Don't talk shit. And what are you, a student too now? - Me? Why? Tell everyone to leave... - Why don't you stay here? Yeah... with the students! The worker has to make it alone... even for three people Before in the factory you didn't have anything to do... you can't go away like this! Listen. To hire you again we will need to fight. Why are you going? Don't isolate yourself! Stay with your friends, it's better for you... damn it! Arturo! - Hi Lulu! You all look like little workers! What you doing around here? Nothing. I'm here. I came to see you. I'm glad. Mother never comes to pick me up at school. I go home alone. Instead I came to meet you... didn't I? And your son Armando what's he doing? Is he with you? It's a while that I don't see him One day we'll take a trip together -Have to see if my mum let's me go with you She has such a character that one! What does she say about me now, your mother?
