I'm trapped. - Ethan. - You've made me unemployable. Ethan, stop. If you're determined to go, go. Good luck. But you'll get no credit here, and no support from me. You'll be doing this on your own. Oh, so this is about my consciousness work. Not yours. Everything generated here belongs to the university. You mean you? That's how this works. Every thought, every half-baked idea inside your head starts with me. Sometimes he won't open it for weeks. If it's urgent, people call. Okay, I swear, I can't with him. He would starve if I didn't tell him to eat. - So. - Wait, you opened my mail? - I did. - You can't do that. Dr. Ethan Kochar, we are grateful for the opportunity to consider your article. We are pleased to inform you... - Read the punchline. - I know, I know, that your article on protein folding and memory will be the focus of the March 5th publication of Nature. What? You serious? Pretty good. See, I should open your mail more often. Believe it or not, that is not a telenovela clip. It is a memory of yours truly from when I made the cover of Nature. So how did we capture it? You'll recall that memories exist as physical imprints on the brain. The R-9X identifies these engrams based on their protein expressions and transfers that data from our internal hard drives to external ones. But making those memories legible is a challenge in and of itself. You remember Berkeley, 2011. Before I took over, the R-9X could not render images more clear than that. So what do you think was missing? Emotions? Thank you, Rachel, yes. Euphoria, fear, lust. Every memory is tied to an emotional section of our brain, even the ones that we bury deep in our subconscious. A sound, a smell, a shape is all it takes for recall. Shit. So to get to legible memories, I knew that mapping emotions was key. May 16th, 2019. Previous findings show that the R-9X can download memories. Current experimentation is a progression of that work. Our major premise, the link between our emotions and our accumulated memories regulates human consciousness. Minor premise, the R-10 can isolate the sections of the brain which impact emotions and behavior. Conclusion, the R-10 is capable of controlling human consciousness. So why does this matter anyway? I mean, it's nice to be able to watch our memories like home videos, but to what end? What about affecting consciousness? The emotions tied to memories exist along synaptic pathways, right? So what if our ideal self's just a question of turning the right ones on and off? Isn't that, like, unethical? Ah, there he is. All right, how so, Mitchell? We're talking about altering what makes you you. Does anybody else find Mitchell's stubbornness, endearing or is it just me? I'm talking about a machine calibrated to the individual. A machine that can erase a veteran's PTSD, that suppresses the reward center for an opioid junkie, and that could boost your intellect. I'm sure some of you could benefit from that. Imagine, consciousness constructed to your own liking. Memories curated to a desired state. And yes, perhaps, changing yourself for the better. All right, well, that's enough for this week. Be sure to read my essay on the self and temporal sequence by next class. Have a great week. Still struggling with the initiation. But I've ruled out the distributors, so it must be the equation. Side note, I had another blackout this morning. Indeterminate time, but they are becoming more frequent. I'm still hoping that the R-10 can pinpoint. A man whose journey into the mind is the basis for all those who come after. His work, fully realized in the R-9X, is perhaps the most groundbreaking discovery of this century. With applications from education to national security. So before I present the plaque for our new lab, I've asked Dr. Kochar's partner to say a few words. The co-creator of the R-9X, Dr. Malcolm Bloom. Thank you, Dean Myers, and thank you all for coming. We were all fortunate enough to know Dr. Kochar. But for a cocksure doctoral student, a position in his lab was dumb luck. I never questioned his judgment, never had to. Until he asked me to be his partner. You can say that I knew Paul better than most. No one could match his brilliance. Kendall, Kahneman, Einstein, these are his equals. We'll be hard-pressed to see Dr. Paul Kochar's influence matched in our lifetime. There's the wunderkind. You're a hard man to track down. How's it coming? - Good. - Good. That's good to hear. Good enough for tomorrow. I thought you rescheduled. I did, for tomorrow. No. No, no, no, no. Come on, Ethan, work with me, so I can keep the committee off your back. Yeah, well, you do it best. Well I've got practice. Ethan, look, you're going through a lot. I get it, we all miss your dad. They'll replace you with someone else if you don't deliver. I thought I already did. I fought hard for your credit, but the R-9 was started with your father and me. You want one? No, I quit. Really? Everyone who matters knows you finished the R-9. Forget the patent plaque. Please, Ethan. It's, it's not ready. Then bullshit your way through. Whatever you're working on, present it. Ethan, we need this renewal. I'm gonna need you at 9:30. I need you to be there tomorrow. - Yeah. - 9:30, okay? Sir? Sir. Are you sure you want another? Yeah. Okay, this is the last one. What's that? Oh, it's... It's nothing, it's a snowflake. What? I'm grateful we didn't lose her to those Stanford hacks. Can't I be grateful? We'll talk about it later. I am so sorry. He's just excited you're back from Stanford. Yeah, it's not a problem. And Joe told me you're in talks about the Kochar lab. Congratulations, you must be thrilled. Thank you, Lauren, it was great to see you. Have a good night. Okay, sure. Thank you. Hi. Hey. You want one? I'm fine. How are you doing, Ethan? I'm great. I saw you talking with Malcolm earlier. How'd that go? I figured he told you. Just about tomorrow. Are you ready? Would it be better if I wasn't? Why don't I take you home? You trying to get me in bed, Dr. Fischer? If memory serves, you're no use in your current state. Mm. Come on, I was an early programmer, remember? Let me help you prepare. I work better when I don't have to walk you through things. It's just... - I'd rather... - It's fine. This is my work! If you're gonna make me choose, I won't! I'm not asking you to choose, Ethan! It's not me or the work, you can have both. I don't know what else to say to you. If you wanna go, go. You could tell me to stay. I want you to say that. Hello? Hey Mom, how are you? Ethan, it's almost one. What's wrong? It's fine, everything's great. Did you send me something in the mail? No, what is it? One of Dad's old notebooks. Notebook? Yeah, it's got a bunch of his work in it. Mom? I'm here. I didn't send it, you know I don't have anything of his. Shit. What is it? It's my nose. What? Nothing, I hit my nose. Was it another episode? Yes. When? This morning, in the bathtub. And then again at the dedication. Two? Ethan, you need to get checked out, it's been eight months of this. Yeah, I know, I'm fine. Hey, are you sure you don't know anything about this notebook? Positive. It's not like he shared any of that with me when we were married. Okay, well I gotta, gotta go. I got a big day tomorrow. All right, well, thanks for the wake up call. No, I know, sorry. Just promise me you'll get checked out as soon as you can. The university doesn't have to know. You know Peggy Sanders, Darren's mom? Had horrible migraines, just horrible. He was able to get her to a specialist who cleared it right up. I'm gonna call her, see if I can get a referral. You have to take better care of yourself. Ethan? Mom, I gotta go. Holy shit. May 17th, 2019. 12:58 a.m. and counting. R-10 has a calibrated map of my brain. I'm counting nine sections. Oh, there's a high co-activity in my cerebellum and prefrontal cortex in section five. Labeling section five as my core intellect. Okay, I'm going to isolate section five and attenuate the others for an hour. See if I get any smarter. Why not? Baseline note. I'm a little drunk. It's 1:03 a.m. No discernible boost in cognitive awareness. At least not yet. Shit. Shit! Shit. Another blackout. Full memory loss for an hour. Let's look again at the memory wipe from last year. I had a week of anterograde amnesia, and now these blackouts. But I don't know, this one feels different. As for last night's experiment, intelligence isolation appear... Intelligence isolation appear... Don't get me wrong, I'm glad you're in such a good mood, but I just can't help but worry after how you sounded last night. I know how much you've dealing with... Hey Mom, I'm sorry, I can't talk right now. Coil readout. All the coils are up. Who ran this? I didn't run this, who the fuck ran this? 12:05, 25 seconds, 26. 27. Okay, 55, 56, 57. Six minutes, six minutes past, six, six... Christ! I could've fucking killed you, man! Get the fuck out of, oh my god. Okay, it's 2:04 p.m. I don't know how, but someone set up the security system. There are four live feeds set up around the house. I'm gonna try to figure out what's going on. Can I help you, Malcolm? You wanna tell me what happened this morning? Oh, yeah, the grant renewal. Yeah. I got a little tied up here. All right. Open the door. I can't do that. I'll talk to you tomorrow, I promise. Hey, you're not the only person on this project. You fuck up, it comes back on me. Malcolm, the only reason why they listen to you is because you got me to come back. My work on this project was just as crucial as yours. You wanna escalate this? I'm more than happy to involve the police. Either way, you're gonna open up the door. Okay. Just give me a minute. Oh, baby. Like an angel! Shut up. See, time is curved. This is how it's supposed to be. Okay. It's 1:32 p.m. I've installed four wireless security cameras around the house so we can track my behaviors. Instead of suppressing my competing emotions, it seems we've isolated them. Looks like 10 sections, including the default. Be sure to take precautions against any outliers. Time to work. Can anybody hear me? Hello! - Alli? - Ethan, what the fuck? What, what happened? - You tell me! - No, I don't know what you're doing here. Malcolm sent me, I told you that. Why are you in this room? You locked me in. You took my phone, you were all over the place. Hello? You were trying to fuck me. And then you passed out, and I... Ethan? Ethan. What are you doing here? I screwed everything up. No, wait, wait. Please, please, please, don't go. - Please don't. - Okay. - Please don't leave me. - Ethan, calm down. I'll be right back, okay? What are you doing in there? Ethan, just tell me what's going on. Tell me what the fuck you were doing in there. Don't, no, no, no! - No! - Get out! Open the door, Alli! Open the door, open the door! Malcolm, it's me, I'm at Ethan's. - Something's happened. - Baby? Just call me when you get this, or I'll explain when I get back to the office. Can I come in? Hey, I'm sorry, I don't know what happened before. Hey, remember when we went down to the stacks, and oh god, you were so wild. I can't stop thinking about it. I want you so bad right now. Ethan? Ethan. Ethan, wake up. Alli? Alli, please wait. Look, Ethan, back off. Alli, please wait. This is monumental for both of us. Last night I had a breakthrough, but it left my consciousness fractured, so now there are 10 of us. But we each only have six minutes every hour, which is why I need your help. I only have a few minutes left. I need you to wait here 'til the top of the hour. That's when the default is back in control. Look. I think you're gonna wanna see where this goes. That's the R-10. It's a build out of the R-9, but it can direct energy at emotion and behavior. I finally got it to map, so I figured, okay, what the hell. Let's isolate my intellect, see the effect. But this morning, I wake up, and suddenly I'm skipping through time. I'd been having these blackouts, so I figured it was that, but it keeps happening, like clockwork. Six minutes every hour. So what were the blackouts before? Another experiment after my dad died. Okay. So you were trying to cycle through these fragments? No, I wanted to attenuate the others for an hour, but the sequencing's off, so every six minutes, another section gets a turn. Like DID. Kind of, but these aren't personalities. It's all still me. So what were you trying to isolate? Hard to say. The patterns for intellect are easy to spot, but the others are less pronounced. You know, there are some things you shouldn't try to control. What's it feel like when you shift? Headache. Everything gets fuzzy. I feel like I'm underwater. Why? I was thinking, sometimes dissociative patients can fight off a shift if they know the triggers. So if this is similar, maybe you can push through, too. Yeah, maybe. The next time you feel it coming, just try to focus. It could buy us time. Don't touch that, Ethan. Did you do that? I'm presetting this video to play during your section. That's section five, my intellect. He's the one I talked to. So, the cycling is not sustainable. We're losing too much oxygen, which means we're getting some cortical-spreading depression. And these headaches, they're gonna get worse and worse 'til there's cell death. We need to get to the reintegration as fast as possible. You're the one section that's in balance, so we need to map you across the whole. That's the reintegration, it's like a reboot using your consciousness. Okay, you have 20 seconds before you shift. When that happens, Alli, I'm gonna need you to go to my room and lock the door. I'll need you back here at 6:30. Interact with only me and the default. You have five seconds. Ethan. Ethan, just look at me. You gotta try, Ethan, come on. Okay, section one now. It's up. There's no system confirmation, but it's showing a power drop. Still not isolating the coils correctly. What about the old sequential startup? Good idea. Which coil's reading? C14. I've got that one, too. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Try C14 and D5. Okay. Anything? No. Distributor must be fried. It'll have to be hand-wired. Then spike my dopamine levels or risk a coma. So we'll need a dopamine agonist. You are correct. We'll be in good hands when you take over. What are you talking about? Look, if you want what you're after, just focus on getting default in one piece. He'll need you to be the face of the project anyway. - Hey. - Hey. Where were you? The animal lab. Ethan, come here. Look at me. How do you feel? I'm fine. Why were you at the animal lab? We needed MDMA for the reboot, intellect sent me. Intellect sent you? Yeah. Okay, we need to figure out who the hell these other sections are. I was dancing with your grandmother - at one point. - Uh-huh, you did. There's some fireworks over there, Ethan. Ethan, I promise that's not gonna help. Just put it down, put it down. We're just gonna work through this, okay? These herring bodies are releasing doses of oxytocin, dopamine from the basal ganglia, too, coming in at minute 54, that's section nine. Euphoria. Oh my god! What? Appreciate you, ma'am. What do you want me to do? I mean, need some self-restraint, maybe. See this concentration of serotonin transporters? Yeah, kicking in at minute six. Generalized anxiety. Section one. Certain cultures, it's considered very masculine. Which cultures? Several of them. It's okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, so we have the nine sections after default. Section one, anxiety. Then 12 minutes in, section two, anger. Section three is libido. Section four is unconscious. Right, all sections asleep. Which is the opposite of you, default, all sections awake and in balance. We know that section five is intellect. And then section six... Calling him primitive. Section seven, creative. And section nine, euphoria. So we just need section eight. Let's take a look at the tape. Okay, now section eight. Wait, stop. Look. Aw, for fuck's sake. What? The notebook. I got a notebook in the mail, it was one of my dad's. Check, check the drawer. Had this equation. Yes, this is all his handwriting. Jesus. Yeah. This is mine. I don't remember any of this. Ethan. Ethan. Come on, try to focus. Can't breathe. I can't fucking breathe! Did you do this? No, my guess is that it was section eight. If so, we need to move him. - What are you doing? - Calling the police. Alli, if you do that, they'll take away the work. We'll never get it back, and I'll probably go to prison. The R-10's almost ready. We wipe his memories and we get him out of here like nothing happened. This is insane, this whole fucking thing is insane. We have to protect the work. It's that important. If I do this, it's not to protect the work. Let me get his head. - I got his head. - Okay. How long before the R-10's ready? A few more cycles. Can you manage this? You can't tell any of the others, not even the default. I need him to focus on the reintegration. Malcolm will be fine, trust me. Ethan. You should never have left. But you'll get no credit here, and no support from me. You'll be doing this on your own. Oh, so this is about my consciousness work. Not yours. Everything generated here belongs to the university. You mean you? That's how this works. Every thought, every half-baked idea inside your head starts with me. They asked about your work habits, I told the truth. Stop with the melodrama. I don't have time for it, I don't have time. Blow out your candles. Paul! Can one of you just find Paul? Alli? Alli! Ethan, how are the headaches? They're worse for me, too. The highest functioning ones are... Can I talk to you for a sec? - You should get going. - I know, but I need to confirm something. Ethan, how are the headaches? They're worse for me, too. The highest functioning ones are burning out first. I have maybe two hours left. Creative, three. Then probably another six hours for you and section eight. And so on. I'd say we have less than 24 hours until full brain death. So I need you to listen, because I don't have much more time to help you. Alli said you remember the notebook. This equation is not the solution we thought it was. The equation we need to do the reintegration is from the same proof, and I'm working on it. But in case I run out of time, you and Alli will have to figure it out. By the way, I figured out what was going on with those blackouts. Seems we were trying to communicate with ourselves, even going so far as to send ourself this notebook. It's not my place to opine on why, but I think we saw what a sad sack of shit we'd become, and decided with total conviction that the solution was to fracture and reset our mind. These were clearly moments of heightened brain activity. It's like psychedelics. - Did you watch the video? - Yeah. It's total bullshit. If I had the answers during these blackouts, you think I'd wanna do this to myself? Ridiculous. Listening to a fucking fragment. He's got you running around doing... Maybe you should take a step back. It's all you, remember? You did this to yourself. Time's up. Checklist. Okay, I already did that. Check the coolant tank. Careful, it's cold. No it's not. It's not. Doesn't make sense. I changed it yesterday. Oh shit. Duct tape. - Seriously? - Yeah. - Will that hold? - Yeah. And if it doesn't? Best case, it doesn't power up. Worst case, it fries whoever's in the chair. It's okay. It'll be okay. - Ethan? - Huh? Get over here. Shit. That's intellect. Let's see how far he got on the equation. What the fuck? Ethan. Section eight again. Who is this guy? Ethan, remember those scans we did at UT Dallas? Yeah, the antisocial ones? Right. See, this is all in line with you, the default. But look at the activity in the basal ganglia here. Psychotic. He's gonna try to map himself across my consciousness. What? Nothing. No, Alli, I know that look, what is it? Ethan. Come on, try to push through it. Focus. Every thought, every half-baked idea inside your head starts with me. Did it work? Can they push through you, too? What's your mother's maiden name? My mother's maiden name? Yeah. Come on, seriously, what is it? Magill, why? Don't say it again. Section eight acts just like me, except he's picked back up my smoking habit. Look at me. How are you feeling, Ethan? That bad, huh? Body's getting hit with a lot. Like a new drug every six minutes. Feels pretty shitty. Did you find the pages? Intellect didn't know, either. Now he's too sick to help. If section eight figures out that equation... I know. I made a real mess of this, haven't I? It's okay. I'm okay. How close were you to the equation before? Close. But without the notebook, I'll have to recreate the work. Shit. There's another equation. You've got five minutes. God damn it. It's on a piece of paper. I wrote it down during one of my blackouts. I got it, I got it. Here. This is the one I used before, from the notebook. It's different, close, but different. This is the one we need. - Are you sure? - Yeah. It's clear to me. Can you push through again? We've got 12 minutes now, but we can use another six. No, the pain's too much. I also wonder what happened to the other guy. Maybe you erased your anxiety. No, I can assure you, my anxiety is alive and well. Oh. Goddamn! Go, Alli. Piece of shit! Why are you still here? Ethan. Come in the room now. Why the fuck are you here? Just calm down, let's just go take a... No, shut the fuck up! You answer my fucking question, what are you doing here? I'm just trying to help. Bullshit! Bullshit! There's an angle. There's always a fucking angle with you. It's that, huh? You're here for this, huh? No, Ethan. Ethan, stop it. Stop it. That what you want, huh? Ethan, don't! You take and you take! No, no, no, Ethan, stop, stop. - Let go of me. - Just take it easy, Ethan, try to breathe. - It's okay. - Let go! Fuck! Sorry. Motherfucker! I'm a big piece of shit! Alli. Alli. God, that feels good. Got the equation. No shit, really? Yeah. You have it with you? Is it right? Yeah. Do not let anyone else have it. How's Malcolm? He's fine, sedated. Good. Do the reintegration first. After that, wipe his memory. So without you? It'll be default's consciousness. He won't remember any of this, will he? No, he won't. Just remind me you had no other choice. I'll be pissed, but I'll get over it. So how are we sure this is gonna work this time? It's just a matter of inhibiting the right proteins. Should've worked the first time when I did it to myself before, but as we know, drunk and impulsive, my precision suffers. Why'd you do it? What? Try to wipe memories of my father? Mm-hm. Resentment. I was with him when he died. He was so hungry. He kept begging for food, but the nurses wouldn't give him any. They were afraid he'd choke. I was so angry. Next thing I know, I'm in a hospital a week later, memories of my father still intact. I wish I could've been more help to you. We'll be fine. I know. Hey, I'm almost done with this rewire. Would you power up the coils? Just wanna make sure these connections are good. Yeah. What happened? Section two. Jesus. Alli, I'm sorry. Look, I don't... I know. Let's bring up the diagnostic. Hey. There's something else going on, right? What do you mean? I don't know. It's hard playing catch-up every hour. That's why I'm here. What is that? It's a song. Oh really, is that what that is? Okay, great, now give me all of them at once. You sure? Yeah, what? You don't want me to check your work? Come on, just do it. Nice. Looks like I got it. Should be good to go next hour. Why don't you go get some rest? No, I'm all right. You look exhausted. You looked in a mirror? Okay. I just mean, look, it's late. You should go lie down. I can finish. Don't worry, I have the time. I'll be out of here before the shift. Alli, it's time to work! How the fuck could you hide this from me? I didn't. I showed you, and we decided when the R-10's up and running, we'll wipe his memory and get him out. You mean you showed intellect and he decided. Ethan, if Malcolm remembers any of it, we're done. Bullshit. You let my intellect use you. You've been using me for years. And you don't give a shit about anything but yourself. I did this to protect you, asshole. Are we doing this or not? Ethan! Okay. I'm setting the wipe to the last 12 hours. Shut it off, shut it off! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Hello. Malcolm home? He is. Brain fried? He was lucid when I left. We should be okay, but I don't know. What are you doing? Relaxing. Shouldn't you be in the lab? Figured I'd sit this one out. What are you doing? Getting my keys. I'm gonna get more coolant from campus. How you gonna use it, anyway? The lines are shot, remember? Guess we'll have to figure it out. Sounds great. Ethan, we had no idea what section eight was gonna do to Malcolm. It was better for intellect to handle. Well gee... Guess it's better when I'm in the dark. Why are you even here, Alli? Well you botched your science project... No, no, no, I mean why'd you leave Stanford? You could have made a name for yourself, why did you come back? You're wasting time. They promise you my work? They did, didn't they? Figured I'd fuck it up and it'd fall to you. You know, I expect my father to fuck me over, not you. Ethan, your father tried to give you credit. The board said no. He got sick and you finished it, but it wasn't yours. And now that it is, you've shut them out. So yeah, they asked me back. They weren't gonna trust this project to an angry child. You know, I used to indulge all this when we were together, but the world's not out to get you, Ethan. I'm gonna go figure out the coolant. And be careful, that's where the noise comes in. You got it? Wait. There's some early work. Could be of interest. Ethan. You should never have left. Hey, it's me. Hope you're not avoiding me. I just wanted to see how you're doing. I know it's tough being back home, but I think it'll be good. Anyway, I hate the West Coast, but it's beautiful here. I think we should talk things over, so call me when you... Hey. Any, any troubles? No, I figured it out. Good, so we're almost all set, then. Yeah, I just gotta rig the coolant, and then the equation. We'll do the reintegration next hour. Fantastic. Hey, can I see it again? Yeah. Are you smoking? I got worried. Hey, Alli, it's fine. Just give me the equation. You pushed through, section eight pushed through. Oh, what are you talking about? What's my mother's maiden name? Don't be ridiculous. Give me the equation. Stop. Stop, stop. Alli, it's me. - Ethan. - No! Alli, open up! We're running out of time. Alli, it's me! Open up! Alli! I feel real sick. I don't think I'm gonna last much longer. Let me in. Please? - Get off me. - Don't. Don't. Alli. Don't. Okay, got three more minutes. Nice work. Ethan, don't do this. I know you're still in there. Have you considered the possibility this is me? Alli, I'm the real Ethan. It's confirmation bias. If you knock on my door a few minutes earlier, you'd be helping me. Ethan, if you do this, the whole you will be lost. If I'm right, then I have to. If I'm wrong, my choice is the same. Wait. What? Did someone change the clock? Alli. Hey. How are you feeling? Good. I want you to take over the project. You know the work, you're smarter than me. I just piss people off. Are you sure? I've spent too much of my time being bitter. And the things I'd change, I can't. I just know I don't wanna do this by myself anymore. Groundbreaking work on temporal perception, I am proud to welcome Dr. Fischer as our newest tenured professor. Thank you, Dean Myers. You're all familiar with Dr. Ethan Kochar and his father, and the work they pioneered. It provided the basis for our design of the R-11, which the university has graciously allowed me to take the lead on. Dr. Kochar's R9-X allowed us to map the neuropathways of memories and extract them. Similarly, the R-10 allowed us to map the neuropathways of consciousness, giving insight into the architecture of behavior. What we saw was both surprising, and yet logical. Our personalities share considerable real estate with our memories. But we still have a choice to make. We get to decide how we interpret our experiences and how they effect who we are. Ethan! Malcolm. You just missed Dr. Fischer's Christening. I know, I'm on my way now. You've even got her doing your lectures for you. Well, it's her project now. Don't wanna miss too much. All right, Malcolm, nice to see you. We're not merely computers, time stamping information our senses take in. Nor are we adding machines marking ones and zeroes on a cerebral ledger. There's something else. Traits that mark us, intelligence, anger, love, do not define us. For in isolation, these fragments are course, even unrecognizable. But when they coexist in a single consciousness, something emerges. Something material, yet immaterial. Dare I even say immeasurable. Something called self.
