"All characters and situations depicted in the film are fictitious." "Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental." "NRJ Energy" Listen up! "The Watcher" Sir, you can't park your car here. -I'm talking to you. Please, re-park it. -I have work to do! -But you're hindering passers-by! -Go to hell! How impolite! Miss, go to hell! Any better? -Loon! -Stupid witch! Kira! Kira! Kira! Look at the time. You're late. Hey. Bolognese for me. You know, I was a brunette before. Dying my hair blond took plenty of time. Ella said I've burnt them. Can't understand why she thinks so. Should I go redhead? Will it suit me? I wanted to buy a wooden phone case recently, but they only have plastic and metallic... Will you re-park the car, or should I bring it piece by piece? Are you crazy? If I were you, I wouldn't deal with him. I bet he's a scumbag in business too. Just look at him. Listen, sorry, I have to go. I'll call you, I promise. Sorry. Excuse me, I can't get out of the parking lot, because of someone's car. Can you make an announcement? Come here. Oh, gosh. I'm really sorry. Gentlemen, as the manager of this restaurant, I'm sorry for this incident. We'll clean it all away. Come on. Clean it away. Hands off! Go to hell! Hands off! Don't touch me! Calm down! Cut it out! Where on Earth did you spring from? Mind your business! Who are you? Are you mad at this nice man only because of his poor parking skills? Yes. -That's it? Nothing personal? -No. Well, that's cool. Are you going to tell me who you are? I'm your guardian angel. What? So you won't tell me. Artem. Relationship status, single. Kira. I don't care. Listen, many things make me mad, but I control myself. If everyone tore side view mirrors away, there would be chaos and anarchy. You're a coward. Wait, what did you think? He goes nuts because of this side view mirror. He calls the police, applause to you? What was the plan? Coward, for sure. -Let's go back if you want to! -All right, let's go! Okay, wait, I understood you're cool. But if you don't mind, we should continue our conversation... ...in a more relaxed atmosphere. I see you can talk non-stop. But that doesn't make you charming, sorry. Oh, come on! Why so serious? Should I give you a lift? Thanks, no need. Hello? Kira, Nastya was hit by a car! She's in intensive care! How is she? Some creep hit her with a car and took off. Doctors say it's a wonder she is alive. One by one. I can see in your eyes that you're wondering who I am. Why did you come with Kira? I dropped her off, so technically she came with me. Got it. Who are you? I'm her friend. Never seen you before, buddy. Are you her boyfriend to see everyone? Yeah, so what? Does Kira know that? Are you a smart jerk? In general or just now? You think they will rescue you because you're at the hospital? You think I won't get laid because she has a boyfriend? Fedya, this is Artem. Artem, this is Fedya. I see you already got acquainted, though. She needs an urgent operation, 250,000. -We'll find the money. -Dollars? Were there any spectators in the accident? Police couldn't find any, so they didn't file the case. Sure, what else to expect from the cops? Right, no expectations. I'll solve this. Hold on. Let me explain to you what it's going to be... ...until you blow up the police station up. -Is this clown always talking like that? -Fedya. Are you really dating him? We, along with Nastya, are classmates. -Do you want me to speak your language? -Go on. Guys, please, stop. May I continue? All right. Of course, we'll do our best. Can't guarantee anything. Come in a month. We'll have to find witnesses by ourselves. Nobody else cares, and cops will drag the case. Desperate, you'll post the story on social media, and get comments like "Poor girl", or "That's her fault." No dice. So? Am I right? Two likes, three reposts? Actually 820 likes and 95 reposts. And one very important e-mail. I received a file on one person and a video... ...where he hits Nastya with a car. Show me. It's someone called Sergey Polyansky. Someone. He's a famous businessman, he has deep pockets. Who sent it? Sent by Anonymous. -Who? -His nickname, Anonymous. -Anonymous. -Anonymous, I see. Great. -We can go to the police with this video. -Yeah, they don't have it, you know. It's weird they don't file a case, right? We need money urgently. I'll go to meet him by myself. I could tell you what it's going to be like, but... No need. -Hello. -Hello, who are you looking for? I'm looking for Sergey Polyansky. Please call his office. -What's the number? -855. Tez-group, hello. Hello, I'm looking for Sergey Polyansky. What time is your meeting scheduled? Hello? At 2:20 PM. -Are you from Rain TV channel? -Exactly. -87th floor, please go upstairs. -Thank you. 87th floor. -Sergey Alekseevich. -Yes? A journalist from Rain TV channel is here. Great. Thank you, Lyudmila. Hi. Please, sit down and write it down. And no mistakes. So our development project in Bangkok tower, Ming-Sing, we will sponsor it with my partner Dmitry Safonov. The Thais want to reach the moon, no problem. We'll help them make the highest tower in Asia. And in the world, if we get 80 million more... By the way, maybe you have 80... Why aren't you writing this down? You hit a girl with a car and took off. She needs an urgent operation. It's a question of life and death. I've a got a video that proves that it's your fault. So either you help us or go to Siberia instead of Bangkok. What's funny about it? You can show this video to the general prosecutor. He's my good friend. -But she can die. -Got it. Everyone will die one day. Life is short. Time is money, though. Do you know how much my minute costs? So let's do it this way, we're even-Steven, keep the change. -Lyudmila. -Yes? Call Borya to the conference room. Anything else? You'll regret it. Borya, Borya, Borya. Tell me, what's going on? Why do crazy girls come to squeeze money from me, huh? -I'll solve this. -You better do. -What's new about that issue? -All is fine. We sold the car backdated. Next time, please be a bit more careful, okay? Sure, sure. Go now. Jerk! He kicked me out. He said he has a prosecutor friend. He doesn't care. Where should we find him? No idea, he wrote that I should be at the main entrance at 5. That's it. He's weird. Hello? You look good. What do you mean? Come through the main entrance. Okay. Let's go. Hi. What's next? That's ridiculous. Go upstairs, then on the right. Upstairs. Now upstairs again, then straight. Straight, upstairs. Smells like borsch. Seems we've been here. Maybe he's cuckoo? Are you making fun of us? Let me talk to him. -Where do we go? -Upstairs. Upstairs. -Grey door. -This way. So? Now go straight through the corridor. All right, what's next? Maybe he's a maniac, guys? Hello? I can't hear you. Where are you? -Hello? -Definitely a maniac. Don't crap yourself. Hello. Have you seen "Saw"? No. I've watched all seven parts. Darn, I stepped on some crap. Look, a camera. Kira! Hey, you! Don't touch them! They are my friends! Go to hell! We don't need your help! I'll knock it out. Can you hear me? Why should I trust them? -You trust me, right? -No. Why on Earth did you bring us here then? Listen, our friend is about to die. Either you let them in, or Fedya will destroy everything here! Got it? Man, you're dangerous indeed. Don't piss me off and help instead. So? Keep off. Okay. -I'll kill him now. -Calm down, please. -Where are you? -On the right, then upstairs. I wonder what was it? Antivirus, I don't let jerks in. What? How should I call you? Artem Reznik from Saratov. No money, so borrowed a lot from friends, and never paying them back. Lives in a campus, car on-the-cuff, easy-rider and a liar. Loves to show off, but even your "expensive" watch is fake. Fedor Bykov. So? Recently came out of the army, no higher education, and prospect of getting it, supports Spartak. Police arrests for disruptive behaviour and fights. Antisocial element with deviations. Fan of "Twilight." Those special effects are good, no? Don't know, haven't seen it. Stop yakking. Are you going to help us or not? If not, we're leaving. I sympathise with Nastya, but my goal is to destroy Polyansky. What did he do to you? Stole your Playstation? He set my family up with an apartment. Besides that, he bought few good sites and forums... ...to make them fee-based and full of adverts, that's unforgivable. So one lives in a campus, another in an attic. Get the hell out of here if you have any issues. Bye. Will you help us or not? Polyansky is my enemy, so I'm ready to help anybody. Excuse me. Hello? Buddy. Let's be honest. We are here because we want the same thing, right? Yes, to save Nastya. No, we want Kira. -Stop. -At least I want her. If you don't want her, that's even better. Less competition. Be respectful. She is not an object to be shared. Guys, let's make a pact. He means a man's word. We'll punish Polyansky, help the girl, and then Kira will decide who she wants to be with. Great pact. I put a stake on myself. I'll kick your butt if you mess around. Bad news. Without an operation, she will die in two weeks. Look, what I found out on this scumbag. Sergey Alekseevich Polyansky, born in 1972, businessman and founder of PNS group. Workaholic, madman, newsmaker. There's another owner of the company, Dmitry Safonov. Polyansky is nervous and unpredictable, aggressive and scandalous. He has a lot of property. He's currently living in a luxurious hotel while his palace is being built. Nothing that can help us get 250,000? Well, you're a super hacker. Hack something to transfer money. Polyansky makes all his big transactions only from his laptop, just like mine, but with custom made software. Money can be transferred only with a PIN-code on his laptop. I tried to hack a thousand times, there's no way. Double protection. I didn't get you. Can you hack it or not? What else? A real estate agent is meeting him on Thursday. He wants to buy an island and setup his own state in a state, a kind of the City of the Sun. Also, he is a fan of esotery, yoga, Buddhism, eastern pseudo-philosophy. Polyansky suffers from mental breakdowns, that's why he was at the rehab in Switzerland. I hacked the clinic's mailbox and found his medical record. Turn it back. Besides that, he's allergic to strawberries, likes Siamese cats, and cheesecakes. I've just subscribed to him on VK. Okay, what else? I often check his secretary's mailbox. She's cute by the way. She writes to her friend that her boss has an affair with Safonov's wife. Oh, dirt. Done. The bird is in the cage. Now watch and learn, guys. Why is he hanging out with us? Don't know, maybe just for fun? Operational service of Moscow Central District. We need to measure the declivity angle in relation to sea lever surface. Where's the window here? Thank you. What's up? -Hardcore porn. -Yuck. Getting it on with your partner's wife so recklessly. You're such a crook. Look. Hello? Hello, Mr Polyansky? It's Anonymous speaking. I have info and proof photos that you're sleeping... -...with your partner's wife. -What? Hold on. -Hello. -Safonov? Guess what? I'm sleeping with your wife. So what? Me too, why are you calling? No, just like that. All right, see you in the office. What now, bummers? I'll find you and bite your heads off if you call again. Fedya. Oh, no, fool. Hey, you. Do you know the girl is in the hospital because of you, huh? Do you know what we do with such scumbags? I could've knocked him out if he didn't have security. No, what's the point? For pleasure? It will be pleasure when we get money to save Nastya. Maybe we can take a loan? Two hundred thousand bucks credit against what? Summer tyres? Or my car? It's on credit as well. What's this? Motorbike. You know, saw one part at a junkyard, then a fuel tank. So making it step by step. I see, we can't get money from this scrap metal. Your iPhone is scrap metal. Can't I have a dream? Just curious, what is this nit dreaming about? Billions of bucks, thousands of hookers, mountains of cocaine, and his own state. You know, I understand him in a way. A state. Guys, I have an idea. Hello. Can I help you? Hello, I'm a representative of Sergey Polyansky's company. My boss is interested in luxury real estate. We sent you a request. Oh, yes, yes, yes. What exactly are you looking for? We have houses along Britain's coastline, French family chateaux, villas with grapelets, I mean, with vineyards. No need for vineyards. Sergey Alekseevich wants to buy an island. An island? Confidentially. Oh, sure. We have a wide range of exotic islands, abandoned pirate islands, Greek love islands, Kuril Islands. We could show it to your boss in person. No, Sergey Alekseevich is a very busy person. He got me to contact all these agencies. So maybe you can give me some info. Leaflets. Adverts. A contract draught. No problem. The faster you do it, the quicker we get the money. Sure. As long as Polyansky is dreaming about a tropic island, we'll make an offer he can't refuse. We'll falsify the documents and transfer the money to our bank account. -Voila! -Way to go. Okay, let's finish with finances. Yes, we... I mean, Sergey Alekseevich, you're totally right. We prepared reporting, and our expenses exceeded the budget a bit... A bit? Did you hear that? A bit, yeah? Where did you get this idiot? Come here! Take off that tie and throw it! You're fired! And no quarter bonus for all of you! Off with you! You. Sit down! I need suggestions on expense reduction by Thursday. Got it? Sometimes, it seems to me that you're a psycho. No. I can control my anger and use it to stimulate them to do what I want. By the way, last quarter, I made them save 1.5 million. So I'm a smart psycho, Dmitry Nikolaevich. We're meeting the Thais in two weeks. Our lawyers insist on sharing charter stakes. It's logical because of the taxes. Fifty percent to the Thais, 25 percent to me, 25 percent to you. Good, good. We need to put a squeeze on them. A bit more. -Okay, see you. -See you. -Lyuda. -Yes, Sergey Alekseevich. What's on schedule? You have a meeting with a real estate agent in two minutes. This one with a bag? -And crafty smiling face? -Yes, right. This, I've seen. This too. And this. Where did he point the camera? Now we see only a table and this stupid toy. It's not a toy, it's Buddha. Artem, set your jacket right. It's not a diamond beach, it's a junkyard. Oh, here, I had two wives. Temporary, you know. This, I've checked. The pictures were good but you can't buy it just like that. Yes. What should we do? We need to help him. Polyansky is about to jump off. That's all bullcrap. Stop. This one. Are you crazy? That's Angelina Jolie's island. Who cares! Let's send the photo so that he'll agree and transfer the money. Yes. That's the bullcrap. I knew from the beginning that it won't suit you. Artem, put a squeeze on him. And that's why I prepared a special offer for you. I bet nobody ever suggested it to you. Wait. Wait. Wait. Go on. No way. He's a dead man. Here it is. First of all, you saved your head. Secondly, you're the first who persuaded me to buy an island. What's your name? -My name is... -Doesn't matter. An island shaped as a heart or a butt, this is amazing. Tell him that Buddha Gautama was born there. By the way, it is said that Buddha Gautama was born there. -Seriously? -Yes. I want this island. What is it called? -Bamboo paradise. -Bamboo paradise. If it works for you, we can sign the documents right now, and then... No, no, no, I don't need it now. What a jerk? All the money is tied up in the business. You know what? Reserve it for me and come when we close the deal. That's all. Okay. Eccentric oligarch Sergey Polyansky met with public notice again. Everyone thinks Polyansky is a liar that sets everyone up, right? Do you know that we provide 17,000 working places... ...at nine constructions around the world? Find at least one who is not paid. We had money and we'll get it soon to fulfil obligations. I'll eat my tie if we don't. He's a real psycho. I can't understand how partners deal with him. He's a real psycho. I told her, I want to get a dog. I wanted a dog all my life. A big shaggy dog, but she doesn't want. She said it stinks, you need to walk it, and it might get fleas. -What about a husband? -Husband. Wait for it. The most interesting part... Sorry. I'm so clumsy. I'm butter-fingered since childhood. I even turned a magazine stand around. I wanted to buy a crossword. I love to take one on the train. But enclosed train platforms are awful. Plants droop... ...from the tobacco smell. Sorry again. Sorry. It worked. Great. Can we do the same with credit cards? Stick to business. Voila. The main thing is to replace sedative pills with stimulants. Then, as planned, the bedroom is on the right, and the living room is straight through the corridor. Let's do it. "Stimulants" Put the flashcard in your watch. How heavy is it? About 30 kilos each. He'll die. Don't overdose on strawberries. We need an allergic reaction, not a corpse. "Strawberry Extract" That's a pity. -Is that fine? -Awesome. "Zeramin" I don't care. Do what you've got to do. The situation is we changed the logistics contractor... ...as per your instructions and now they're dragging out the contract. Okay, what is your suggestion? We tried to solve this and contact the previous guys... Speak louder. In short, they have a principled ground, and want to raise tariffs for the carriage, because you've left them... Sergey Alekseevich? -Sergey Alekseevich? -Yes. -Let me try to explain it again. -No, no, no. No explanations. We just don't know what to do. -Do as you want. -But... -It's your duty, got it? -But Sergey Alekseevich... Shit. Darn! Idiots! Good night, freak. Wait for a big bada-boom. "04:27" "Zeramin" What's going on? -Sergey Alekseevich, is everything fine? -Mind your own business! So the object's lack of sedative and heavy dose of stimulants... ...has turned his brain into a boiling pot of thoughts and paranoia. The main meeting with the partners is on Wednesday. By that time, he'll be totally insane. Fedya, please be careful with the dosage. We don't want the whole office to go bonkers. Don't worry. -Have you washed the car? -Of course. Excuse me, who are you looking for? I'm looking for the ventilation system. You know there's a big hole in there. No? Okay, I can handle it. There may be a rat inside. Crawl straight until you see a fork, then turn to the left. Careful, you're above the security manager's office. "04:27" "Laughing Gas" Don't let anyone in. The first to come in, will be fired. Index dropped by 2 percent. Can you imagine? We'll wait for Polyansky in the hall. Turn off the cameras, please. We'll wait for your signal. Okay, turning off. Is everything done? -Have you hung the painting? -Yes. -I'm telling you, Zhenya is a genius. -I can hear you. The genius is the one who got the card. The genius is the one who came into a guarded office... ...with a laughing gas balloon. Darn it. What on Earth are you doing? Are you nuts? They are everywhere. Who? Me and you, we save the people. -Take them and run. -Are you crazy? Darn! Bloody hell! It's an in-company training... ...for anger management. Come with me, let's talk a bit. Yes. Yeah, yeah. I was a little drunk. All right. It's all because of a magnetic storm. Okay, okay, don't shout. Got you. I'll watch myself. Yes, yes, I'm here. Remind me later, I'll hang up now. Bye. Kira, it seems you got carried away. He left. You'll clean the strawberries. Besides that, the room is a total mess... -Excuse me? -There's an iguana. Iguana, do you understand? What the heck is it doing there? -Alive? -Of course, very alive. Please don't worry. We'll solve this. -Come with me. -Yes, let's go. -You'll catch it, you heard me? -Yes. Good. -Thanks, thanks. -No worries, it will be fine. Hurry up. They are in the elevator. Did you take the iguana? Why are you looking at me? Catch this thing! -Do you want some camomile tea? -Bug off. Hello, Eduard Filipovich, it's Polyansky. You know. Yes, it got worse. Of course, I take it. Yes, one pill. Take more? Okay. No, I can't, no time. If it gets worse, I'll go away. Yes, sure. Thanks a lot. "04:27" Done, he went bonkers. Yes. We're almost here. So the meeting with the Thais is the day after tomorrow. He'll be ready. To the left. Yeah, unload it there. Cement from the second floor should be closer to the entrance. Excuse me. What do you want? What team are you from? From the second. They delivered cement, run there. The chiefs are coming today. My phone has fallen into mazut. Take the steel away. What? I said my phone has fallen into mazut and my wife is giving birth now. Can I call from your phone? Quickly. And not to Moldovia. Take it away and turn off this mixing batch. They are here. There you go. The chiefs came. Thanks a lot. Put a helmet on. Okay. Well, well, well. That's okay, we don't have much time, do we? We have enough. So? How goes it? -It is being constructed? -Of course, it is. Who's in charge here? Come here. Come, come. All right. Hello, Sergey Alekseevich. Let me show you my land. Listen, you. This is my land, you just worked on here. Calm down. -What's the situation with timescales? -It seems all is fine. Seems? -I mean, all is good, Sergey Alekseevich. -Good. Yes, just look around. Hush! Stay where you are! Everyone! And you too! Serega. Easy. Get a hold of yourself. Come here! I haven't finished with you! What, what, what? Maybe you go somewhere? Have a vacation? I'll finish the meeting with the Thais and then I'll go. -Maybe I can finish it alone? -What's the matter? You don't need me anymore? Serega, stop it. Stop it. Nuts to you! Don't forget. The meeting is tomorrow at 12. Look after him. "Transmission Signal Replacement" Safonov is going to set Polyansky up. Events planning company, hello. How can I help you? Hello, I want to book a group of dancers in T-shirts with number 4.27. -Okay. When and where? -Right now. Please, write down the address. Building 3, Moscow City. Hello, I want to order 22 vacuum cleaners. The address is 73, Hotel XR. Hello, I want to order 76 car tyres. Everything for our lovely one. It can be delivered within an hour. What's the address? Please specify the delivery address. We can deliver within an hour. Thank you, have a good day. "4.27" What the heck is this? Go away! I'll take her. Yes, away with her. I said away with her. Gang away. "4.27" -What was that, Borya? -I don't know. -Then who knows? -I don't know! Miss Darling, next time. Let me by, please. What's going on? -Pizza? -What pizza? -Leave me alone. -Back off! Stay where you are! Open it! Pronto! Let's go, Borya. What's all this bullcrap? Seems they came for you. -Me? -Why did you call them? Me? All this circus? And I booked a monkey as well? Are you insane, Borya? Let's go, Sergey Alekseevich. Let's go. The object is in the elevator, hurry up. Come on, print it. Come on. Borya. Stay here and don't let anyone in. Sawadee krap. Sawadee krap. Sawadee krap. Sawadee krap. Tell them it's the traffic jam. Are you okay? Were you thinking of doing it all alone? Serega, we're waiting for you. Lyudochka, please bring the contracts. Hurry up, I need time to download it from the laptop. You creep, here. Help me, smart turd. -Darn! Did you put it in? -I'll put it in you, if you don't stop. Fedor, take control of yourself. All right, I'll copy his laptop's interface and send it you. Kira, Artem, over. -Roger. Roger that. -Roger. Okay, paragraph 4.27, distribution of profit. Investors get 51 percent, Safonov, 48 percent, Polyansky, 1 percent. What do you mean? You want to shaft me? I don't get you. What can't you understand? What is this? The skyscraper they decided to build, you think Polyansky is a fool? Serezha, it's just a mistake. We'll correct it now. It's a mistake to work with you! Forty-eight percent, not too much for you? Stop translating! Are you crazy? Wanted to set me up, slime bag? Stay put! Stop, stop, stop! Calm down! -Get the heck out of here! -Easy, easy. Buzz off! Scum! Are you okay? Disappear! Call to the agency, now! -Tell them to prepare the documents. -One minute, please! What do you mean you forgot? One second, I'm searching. Stupid witch. Sergey Alekseevich, my dear fellow. You need to calm down. Do you hear me? I'm as cool as a cucumber. Let's call a doctor. For what, Borya? Let me go. -Please, wait. -Get out my way! Elite Real Estate Agency Realty Group, how can I help you? It's Polyansky speaking. I need a contract, make it in 40 minutes. And book a business ticket from Sheremetyevo on to the first flight. Yes, sure, we're waiting for you. Hello, I'm calling to say that my boss... ...decided to take the Bamboo Paradise island. My advice, don't ask questions, don't argue, don't irritate him, he's a short-tempered person. He's on his way to you. Zhenya, he pulled away from us. I can't catch up. I'm sorry, people. Go, go, go! Move! What? Why are you staring? Go away! Red light again. Darn, where are you going? Why have you stopped? Get out my way! Can't you understand? Get out of my way. Sergey Alekseevich, hello. -Do you want some coffee? -What coffee? I need documents. Hurry up, you have two minutes. -What? -One minute. No problem. What island are we talking about? Bamboo Paradise, a heart-shaped island. Yes. Actually, it's not quite heart-shaped. Sorry, here's his laptop. Well, Polyansky cross-flashed his laptop. What now? As soon as he enters the password and makes the transfer, I'll have only 90 seconds to transfer money to our account. As soon as we get money to our account in 24 hours, you'll get the island. Today. We're almost here. You see, Kira, if you do everything my way, you can... Hi. Don't move, guys. Don't force me to do it. Come on, were you really thinking nobody will find you? Kira, run when I say so. -Hello? -Hello. I caught them. Thank God. Come here with the laptop. Give me the laptop. Run! Kira! Kira! -What's happened? -Zhenya is there! They took the laptop. Keep your hair on. Polyansky has a lot of money in the bag. -We need to go to the airport. -To the airport. Let's go. I'll distract him, you catch the bag. Hey, Dad! Daddy, don't fly away! Don't leave me alone! Police! Help! Oh, it's you! Catch them! So, guys? Why are you barefoot? It's a long story. Let's go. -What? Should we call Zhenya? -Yeah. There are 20 missed calls from him. Why did you stop? Oh, really? -How much can we get? -Enough for us. Kira? -Will you hug me? -Hush. Can you feel it? What's this? Seriously? -Are you a fool? -Are you insane? It's for Nastya's operation. I want to do it like in the movies. Take it now. Boris. Come in, sit down. All is ready. You know, I'm really glad you and I could agree. And get rid of this psycho as well. Okay, give me the laptop. Borya, I like happy endings. We barely calmed the Thai partners. They were running around the office chirping like chimpanzees. So the deal is done? Come on, who else will construct such a skyscraper for this ridiculous price. What's this? Oh, my gosh. Go away. So I covered us up. For Safonov, we're innocent. It's Polyansky who stole all the money. The government of Thailand... ...arrested a famous Russian businessman, who wanted to bankrupt and defraud his own company. Thai officials also have questions. Polyansky was arrested for home invasion... ...at the villa of actress Angelina Jolie. Mr Polyansky created a disturbance, tore a portrait of Brad Pitt, and beat a housemaid. Turn down the volume, please. We're getting ready for an operation. We'll start in the morning. Don't be nervous. It will be fine. Let's move to other news. A car accident relief foundation received an enormous amount, 25 million dollars, from a charity provider who preferred to be anonymous. Couldn't you leave us at least 1 million? Why not? -Artem, this is not our money. -People need it more. Should I get into a car accident to get some of it? That's an idea. It will happen to everyone who becomes crazy, because of self-determination and impunity. Are we Eco-terrorists now? They say there's no bad media. Listen up. This car accident has happened, because of the famous Russian businessman Sergey Alekseevich Polyansky. Police didn't want to file a case, all videos were deleted. A rich and powerful creep once again... ...wanted to avoid taking on the responsibility. They are used to it. The word "justice" has lost its sense. Nobody cares about it. Nobody but us. Good night and see you soon. Maybe we're not always right, but this time we are, and there's no other way.
