(soaring instrumental music) (dramatic music) (hanger slide along rack) (footsteps shuffle) (buttons beep) (door buzzes) (door opens) (door shuts) (drawer slides) (tense dramatic music) - Bob, what are you doing? (drawer slides shut) You can't take that outta here, Bob. (hand clasps throat) (dramatic suspenseful music) (body thuds) (foot kicks desk) (desk bangs against wall) (woman cries out) (head hits desk) (heels clack) (muffled chatter) - Grace. - Oh. - (groans) Are you okay? - (cries) I feel like death. I can't believe it happened. - Didn't you have a clue? - No, nothing. Last night, it was wine and candlelight. Then this morning, he said he wanted his own space. - Space. - Oh, it's so nice of you to let me stay. - Oh, it's my pleasure. I just wish I didn't have this faculty meeting, but I'll be home at 10 and then we can talk. Would you just do me a favor and take my books on home? - Oh, sure. - This is the key to the downstairs door. The next one is for the apartment. The bread is in the fridge. The scotch is in the cabinet in the living room. (groans) I'll see you later. It'll get better, I promise. - All right. (heels clack) (horns honk in distance) (dramatic music) (door opens) - Mary Casallas? (door shuts) - I don't have anything to do with the agency anymore. - It's about Robert Golem. (soft dramatic music) (crickets chirp) (helicopter blades whir) (horses neigh outside) (dog whimpers) (dog barks) (horses neigh) (door opens) (door shuts) (door opens) (horses neigh) (footsteps shuffle) (dog barks) (door shuts) - What do you say, old pal of mine? - Come on in. (footsteps shuffle) (soft tense music) - [Calvin] How are they, Henry? - Kids are fine. They were here at Christmas. They'll be back this summer. - They must be, what now, about high school age, huh? - Try college. (flames crackle) - That's incredible. Have you talked to Molly? - Molly remarried three years ago, Cal. You didn't need a helicopter trip for that information. My phone works. As for yours? - Yes. Well, I'm sorry. I have a renegade agent. He's murdered two of my men. - Cal, I can rent you a horse. The hours are eight to four. - [Calvin] This one is a real shark. - You have an army of 30-year-old hot shots. - I have a reason to believe that he has memorized the file of every man in the agency. Now the fact that you haven't been in it for eight years gives you the advantage that I need. (tense music) (heels clack) (soft tense music) (audience applauds on TV) - [Show Host] And today, we'll try to discover who will become her next husband on "Let's Get Married"! And now let's meet the star of. (tense music) (lock clicks) (muffled speaking) - [Show Host] And Debbie is indeed going to be married. Debbie is marrying one of these three gentlemen. Question is she marrying. (door opens) (muffled speaking on TV) (chain rattles) - The man walking into the room is Robert Golem. He's been with the agency for six years. His assignment was WHSLM. - That's alphabet soup to me. - Western Hemisphere, St. Louis, Missouri. Status has been frozen for two years. - Why? - His job classification was canceled. - Whose file is he taking? - His own. (door opens) (heels clack) - This is Mary Casallas. (door shuts) - Man, he's a killing machine. What department is he in? - Assassination. (dog whimpers) (footsteps shuffle) - Assassination? His own department? - Not a department, a section, separate and autonomous every other agency or bureau. I just found out about it this morning. - Come on, Cal. Get a bloody chief. - For less than a year, that section was set up six years ago, disbanded two years ago. Remember Phil Dewberry? - Sure. - We found his body six hours ago, a suicide. He left that. (cup clinks) - "Everything I did was for the good of my country. Anything left unfinished, Golem will finish"? What was Dewberry's relationship to Golem? - Same section. - No, no, no. He was a technician. Explosives, special weapons - Assassination. (tape clicks and whirs) - According to his psychological profile, he was bitter about his section's termination. He refused transfer and retired. He moved from St. Louis to an ancestral home near Santa Fe, New Mexico. - Look, he may have been psychotic. He might've been turned. We don't know, but for him to kill two of our agents for his own dossier, well, that suggests it's just the tip of the iceberg. - How many other people were in is section? - One. - Me. - [Calvin] Mary is the only agent who have worked with him. She knows exactly how he operates and how to handle him. - Then you don't need me. - He'd spot her before she got within a mile of him. It's not the old days, Henry. As assassins, we were novices. We were operating on idealism and luck. Golem is a professional, as you said, a killing machine. No active agent could get near him. That's why we need you. - Cal, there are a lot ex agents. - Not of your caliber. - And not within shouting distance of Los Angeles. - Robert Golem is going to kill a lot of people. - Where's he headed? - We don't know. He got out of St. Louis before we could get to him. - I know where I can go if Mary Casallas was the only person who knew how I operated. I'd consider her very dangerous. - If he comes after me, it'll be good. Oh my God. (discordant tense music) (buttons click) I have a friend staying with me. You've reached 555-3247. I'm busy in the moment, but if you'll leave your name and phone number and a brief message after the beep, I'll get back to you. (answering machine beeps) Grace, it's Mary. Pick up the phone. I need to talk to you. Grace, please pick up the phone. - Could she have gone out? - No, she's got my house key. She's expecting me home any minute. Grace, please pick up the phone. Grace, honey, pick up the phone! (phone clicks) - Hello? - Grace! Oh, Mary. (laughs) Hi, Mary. I drank all of your scotch. - Grace, don't ask any questions. I want you to do something for me. I want you to leave the apartment right now. - Leave? - It's important. Don't ask questions. Just leave. Why? What have I done? - Nothing, honey. Just do it. No questions. - What's the matter? There's a guy coming to the apartment, a crazy. Just get out of there. - No, I'm fine. I put the chain on the door. - [Mary] A safety chain doesn't mean anything to this psycho. Grace, are you listening? Grace! Talk to me! (tense brooding music) - The chain is broken. - Get out of there right now. Hurry! (phone thuds) (tense music) (door slams) (helicopter roars) (horses neigh) - This thing is for elephants. Same as a .38, they don't jam. - Not this time. - You worried about me? - No, about him. - If you get a shot, aim for the stomach. He wears a bulletproof vest. - Between his eyes? - Aim for the stomach. Shoot anywhere else, you won't live to tell me I was right. - Her life is on the line, too. You learn to trust her. (slow dramatic music) (horns honk) (door opens and shuts) (footsteps shuffle) (footsteps shuffle) (gun cocks) (foot slams into door) (slow tense music) (discordant tense music) (knob rattles) (curtain rattles) (door opens) (clothes whoosh to side) (footsteps shuffle) (phone clicks in receiver) - Owner, this is Janitor. - This is Owner. Go ahead, Janitor. - [Henry] The apartment's clean. Couldn't hit. (footsteps shuffle) (taxi approaches) (door opens) (heels clack) (door shuts) Hello? - The owner. (door buzzes) (knob rattles) (door opens and shuts) - Are all these books yours or left over from a busted romance? - Why? Is there something a woman couldn't read? - There's plenty a person couldn't read. Cybernetics? - Well, we obviously don't know the same people. Look, have you looked under the bed and in the closets? - All but the locked door. - Locked- (dramatic suspenseful music) (Mary cries out) (gun thuds to ground) (body thuds) (glass clatters) Henry, watch out! (arm slams into shelves) (glass shatters) (gun cocks) (lamp shatters) (gunshot blasts) (gunshot blasts) (bullet ricochets) Aim for the stomach! (window shatters) (debris clatters to ground) Damn. - Who? What is that? - A robot. Base, this is Owner. The bird flew north to Sunset. - [Man] Roger, Owner. (static hisses) (horns honk in distance) - I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you. - Sorry? It's my head if I don't duck! - Lantz thought that if you know, you'd turn us down. - What the hell happened? (punch lands) (Calvin grunts) (punch lands) (door opens and slams) (footsteps shuffle) - Henry! I don't blame you for being mad! - That's sweet of you! - But I need your help! - Goodbye! - Henry, do you want your jacket? The robot's not programmed with your dossier. He doesn't know your strengths, your weaknesses, or how you operate. That's a better edge than any other agent Lantz can offer me. - I'm not an agent, and Lantz is not my boss. - I don't care about the agency. - Why don't you hide until they find the robot? - I have to find him. (muffled chatter) (footsteps shuffle) When I went to work for Natronix Corporation, I didn't know why they were developing the robot. And when the project was moved to the agency and they asked me to stay with it, I agreed. Hell, I was flattered. They respected my work, and I was honored to do something for my country. Five years ago, a South American diplomat was shot to death behind the wheel of his car. I saw the photos on the 11 o'clock news. The next morning when I went into work was the first time I ever saw Dewberry express any emotion. (laughs) He was so excited. He couldn't contain his secrecy. It was our creation, the Golem who'd carried out that assassination. I left the agency that afternoon, and I've been teaching ever since. You're not the only one they're dragging out of mothball. - That's a flattering image. - Do you know Asimov's three laws of robotics? One, (sighs) a robot must never injure a human being; two, a robot must obey orders given it by a human being except where those orders would conflict with law one; and three, a robot must protect his own existence as long as that protection does not conflict with the first and second laws. When we created an assassin robot, we broke every law. This thing has been programmed by Dewberry to kill. We don't know who or how many targets there are. (sighs) They could be members of Congress. They could be the president, and anything that gets in Golem's way is gonna die. He's been programmed to carry out his mission, and he's been programmed to survive. You gonna eat your pie? (plate slides) - Then why would I wanna get into its way? - Not for the agency. Maybe for your country. Maybe for yourself. I've read your dossier. You're a man with a conscience. (crickets chirp) (heels clack) (buttons beep) (door whirs open) I went to work for Natronix Corporation just after receiving my MS in cybernetics. (door whirs closed) (machines trill) They were working on a prototype humanoid. My contribution was in the control area, primarily sensory. This humanoid has binocular vision as well as field magnification and infrared sensors. He has the auditory acuity of better than any living creature. He has a sense of touch but not pain. The only senses that he lacks are smell and taste. Dr. Dewberry's contribution was in the motor area, specifically offensive and defensive capabilities. He's flameproof, fireproof up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. He's bulletproof to anything up to a nine-millimeter caliber from six feet. Now that can pierce the skin, but it won't do any damage unless it's abdominal. - Why abdominal? - The primary targets for a bullet are the skull or the chest. We reduce the odds on crippling him by placing the brain in the lower abdomen. - Does he have any other weaknesses? - There are two others. We couldn't allow him to fall into enemy hands. When attacked, he's programmed to react and survive, but in an indefensible situation when he can neither fight nor run, he's programmed to self destruct. - How? - Explode. - Remind me not to be in the vicinity. What's his other weakness? - We were afraid to use plutonium batteries because of the chance of radioactive fallout in case of self destruction. The secondary power source is solar through his eyes, but that's not enough power for longevity. He needs to recharge from an electrical source every 72 hours. He's programmed to find a defensible situation and plug into an electrical outlet. He needs 30 uninterrupted minutes. During that time, he has no defense. - That's when we have to get him. - First, we have to find him. - We have agents staking out the airline terminals, bus and train depots, all the hotels. - Do they know what they're dealing with? - I want him stopped as quickly and quietly as possible. I don't want what we know to go any further than this room. Is that understood? - How about carte blanche? I want full authority, full cooperation, and full access. Is that understood? - (sighs) Yeah. (tense music) (footsteps shuffle) (tense brooding music) (metal clatters) (machine whirs) (sparks hiss) (birds chirp) (gunshots blast) (bird caws) (gun clicks) (footsteps shuffle) - I've got Phil Dewberry up on the computer. - Anything on the robot? - No. - This thing has the finesse of a flintlock. It's a good thing your robot doesn't use a gun. - He can shoot out a candle flame at 200 feet. - Great. - Well, you can't be an assassin and not use a gun. - He's done all right so far. - Don't forget that his eyes have built-in telescopic vision. - Any other surprises? - He can reach running speeds of up to 30 miles an hour. - But can he make love to a woman? - Mm-hmm. - Say you're joking. - Sometimes it's necessary for cover. - Who taught him? - Dewberry. - Did Dewberry christen him? - Mm-hmm. - Now Robert I can understand. It's close to robot, but who dug up the Golem? - Folklore. It was a zealot rabbi in 16th-century Prague. He created a clay creature, called it Golem, brought it to life to protect the Jews from persecution. Ironically, it turned on its creators. (machine beeps and trills) - I need to know about the man, not all this dry information. I hate those things. Tell me about him. (mug thuds) (computer keys clack) - I don't have a lot to tell. He was punctual and precise. He never spoke beyond the experiment at hand. He had no sense of humor. I never saw him animated except when we solved a problem. - How about his family? - Well, he was a widower. That's in his dossier. - There's gotta be more than that. I mean, you must've talked to him. - Not beyond the project at hand. - Over lunch or dinner or a cup of coffee? How can you work with a man six or seven years and not know many better than the inside of a television set? - It was three years, and he was the inside of the television set. (soft music) (computer keys clack) (metal scrapes) (tense brooding music) (metal clinks) (stomach whirs open) (metal clinks) (stomach whirs closed) (plastic rustles) (traffic hums) (horns honk) - [Man] Hey, watch it. (buttons beep) (machine trills and beeps) (dispenser whirs) (footsteps shuffle) (traffic hums) (soft piano music) (front desk phone rings) - Oh, good evening, sir. - Good evening. Do you all your rooms have individual air conditioning units? - Yes, sir. - Good. I'd like a room place below the 6th floor. - Below the 6th floor? Yes, sir. I think I can arrange that. (front desk phone rings in distance) - I don't know when I'll be home, Grace. (computer keys clack) Well, maybe in a day or two. I can't tell you what's going on or where I am. Yes, I'm hiding from the psycho. Can we talk about something else? Well, what about you and Jack? (tense brooding music) (machines whir and trill) I found something. (footsteps shuffle) He kept a journal. I completely forgot about it. - Did he always do that? - For the three years I worked with him. - I bet he worked that way his entire career. That's a lot of journals. With his type of personality, I bet he saved 'em. - Mm-hmm. (phone rings) - Hello? We'll be right there. Come on, doc. (footsteps shuffle) (dramatic music) (car hums) (door shuts) - Checked into room 512. I notified hotel management. They're cooperating with us. I commandeered a room on the 6th floor across the street. We can't see what he's doing. His drapes are drawn. - Well, he doesn't need a bed to sleep in, that's for sure. Let's hope he has to recharge his power supply. Equipment arrive? - I'm setting up now. (doors open and close) (footsteps shuffle) (door opens) Why don't we break the door down and shoot him? - We catch him recharging, he's defenseless. No one will get hurt. - How do you trace a recharge in a place that uses this much power? - He needs a 220-volt outlet. That means the air conditioning supply. It's cold out. I don't think he'll find many air conditioners in use. If he plugs in, we'll spot him. Good evening. - Once that happens, can we turn the power off down here and put him on a commission? - No, he has an override. You turn off the power, he'll wake up. - [Man] C2 to H1. - H1. - [Man] He's come down. He's gone to the bar. - Good. He hasn't had time to recharge. We'll be ready. (soft pleasant piano music) (muffled chatter) - Thank you. - Oh, Lord. You are a beautiful-looking specimen. (laughs) Why don't you just turn this way and make me happy? - Were are you speaking to me? - (coughs) No. I was just thinking out loud. (slurps) Are you new in town? - Yes. - (laughs) Hi. (traffic horns honk in distance) - How long did I sleep? - An hour. - Did you sleep? Can't be because you're not tired. Is it the dream? I read your dossier, remember? - Haven't had it for awhile. It used to be every night. - And now it's back? - Back? I don't kid myself that it's ever gone. - Bomati was a terrorist. Worse. He bankrolled terrorist organizations all over the world. - I have no guilt over Bomati. I was ordered to take him out. One man on a small private airplane. He changed his plans. 167 people were killed in that plane crash. Sleeping isn't my favorite pastime anymore. - Your dossier doesn't mention that there was supposed to be a private plane. I know a lot more about you now. (soft music) - I knew it. I knew you must be a model. What kind? - Body. - Nude? - Usually. - Centerfold? - Scientific journals. - You're joking, right? - I have to go now. - So soon? - I have a business meeting. - Wait. (objects shuffle) (muffled chatter) Just a minute. For futures. - Thank you. (footsteps shuffle) - [Man] H1, this is C2. - Go ahead, C2. - Subject has left the bar. (static hisses) (door opens) (muffled chatter) - He's getting off at the 5th floor. (static hisses) (machines trill) (dark brooding music) (door opens) (machines beep and trill) (footsteps shuffle) (door opens) (door shuts) (knock thuds) (punch lands) (dramatic music) (slow dramatic music) (machine trills) (body thuds) (knob rattles) (lock clicks) (chain rattles) (leg whirs open) (cord unravels) (machine beeps) - We got him. - Get him now. (dramatic music) (elevator doors slide open) (door slams open) - H1, this is C2. Not in his room. - Are you sure? - The room is empty. - He must've taken another room. We have 27 minutes to find him. Get your men outside. Two out in front os snipers, two in the back in case he gets away, two cars on the perimeter. How many rooms in this hotel? - 500. - He won't go above the 5th floor, not if he wants another exit. He can't survive more than a 50-foot fall. Go room to room from the 5th floor down. - You got a master key? - Yes, sir. - It'll save you some damage on your doors. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (knocks thud) (door cracks open) (dramatic suspenseful music) (knock thuds) (light clicks on) (door opens) - Excuse us, please. (knock thuds) (key clicks) (knock thuds) (knock thuds) - Nothing. - How's our time? - Less than a minute. - We've got 40 rooms to search. - Excuse me, sir. This one's locked from the inside. - Use your foot. (foot kicks door) - [Man] Something's jammed against it. (plug clicks) (chair and door clatter) (gunshots blast) (lamp shatters) (gunshots blast) (lamp shatters) (window shatters) (car crunches) (footsteps shuffle) - Has this thing never heard of elevators? (tires screech) (dramatic suspenseful music) (gunshot blasts) (tires screech) (gunshots blast) (tires screech) (tires screech) (car collides) (footsteps shuffle) - Did you see that sucker jump? (slow dramatic music) (machine clicks and whirs) (crickets chirp) - The whole approach was to keep this under wraps! You go shooting up the hotel in front of several hundred witnesses, and then you don't get him. What's a matter, Henry? Your eyes going? - I was supposed to shoot him in the stomach. I shot him in the stomach twice. - I saw it. - So what happened? - I don't know. - I don't know. You're the bloody expert! - That was Wheeler. We've been monitoring police calls. They found a man dead with his neck broken. He owned a metal shop. There's evidence that the killer cut a steel plate. - He reinforced his stomach. - Oh, no. (laughs) Oh, boy, am I gonna pay for this. Is this ironic? I mean, I guarded my career so carefully. I never made a step that hadn't been reconnoitered from every angle. Now I'm going down the tubes because of someone else's megalomania! - I'm going to Santa Fe to Dewberry's house. He kept journals of his work. We can find 'em, maybe we'll find out who's next. - This thing is in LA. I need you here! - What do you want from us, Cal? You want us to wait till he surfaces? He's already fixed one of his weaknesses. What if he shows up in a crowd? You want us to blow him to kingdom come with a missile? Let's go to Santa Fe. (footsteps shuffle) (door whirs open) (door whirs closed) - What journals are they talking about? - We tore the house apart. If there are any journals there, we would've found 'em. - Well, I want someone to keep an eye on them. If they find any journals, I see them first. They could be embarrassing to the agency. (heels clack) (soft tense music) (computer keys clack) (computer buzzes) (knock thuds) (soft dramatic music) (light clicks on) (knock thuds) (light clicks on) (door opens) (chain pulls) - Bob? - May I come in? - Sure. (door shuts) (chain rattles) (door opens) - Thank you. (door shuts) - Are you all right? - Yes. May I use your bathroom? - Sure. It's around the corner. What happened to you? - The business meeting went badly. - You've gotta be kidding me. Are those bullet holes? - Powder burns. - Can I get you a drink? - Yes, please. - Okay! (tense music) - [Robert] Do you have an iron I can borrow? (iron sizzles) - Here you go. - Thank you. (glasses clink) I also need a place to stay tonight. - You can stay here. - Thank you again. (soft pleasant music) (birds chirp) (car rumbles) (door opens) (doors shut) (tense music) (footsteps shuffle) (door shuts) (Mary and Henry exhale sharply) (tense discordant music) - Did you sleep? (birds chirp) Bob? (chuckles) Did you sleep? - No. - (chuckles) Do you ever sleep? - Rarely. - (laughs) You sure never get tired. I can vouch for that. (door opens and shuts) (birds chirp) (bird calls) (footsteps shuffle) (footsteps shuffle) (bird calls) (bird calls) (soft music) (bolt cutters clink) (lock snaps) (latch clinks) (bar slides) (leaves rustle) (door opens) (light clicks on) - I thought they quit making these things in the 50s. - (sighs) It may have been here that long. - Radio wasn't here in the 50s. (footsteps shuffle) Over in 1985, Mr. Philip Dewberry. Get the feeling he feels a little paranoid? (can thuds) (boxes thud) (paper rustles) (package crinkles) (door opens) - I bought it in a shop down the street. (door shuts) (plastic rips and rustles) They had it in brown, but I think blue is more your color. - Mm, very tasty. - (laughs) Ooh! Easy. You are strong. - Sorry. - [Woman] I like it. (lips peck) (woman giggles) (contraption clicks and whirs) (ball rolls) (birds chirp) (footsteps shuffle) - Do I smell food? - Coffee and a muffin, over there. Did you check this out? This man had an ingenious mind. (object shuffles) Are you involved with anyone? - That's personal and off limits. - You looked at my dossier. I could just put yours in a computer, punch it in. - In capsule form, not involved, never married, two near misses, when I regretted, when I was thankful for. Aren't you gonna eat anything? Mm, might be poisoned. - Tasteless wax. (grunts) Why would he make phony gumballs? - Why not? He made phony people. - Gumballs are cheap. They're probably cheaper than wax. - Maybe he didn't want someone like you coming in here and consuming his experiment. - (clears throat) This man was a recluse. Nobody came in here. (gumballs clatter) Got a knife? (drawer slides open and shut) (machine rattles) (gumballs clatter) (knife carves gumball) This one's real. (knife carves gumball) 322. QLRTBL8505. That's the lock manufacturer and the code. - Listen, old pal of mine. This is not FBI jurisdiction. We're having a problem with one of our agents. He's a psychiatric case. (machine trills and beeps) (laughs) Oliver, do you really believe anyone can run 30 miles an hour or jump over a car? Come on. (laughs) I don't care what people think they saw. Look, we shot at him because he's dangerous, but that's between us and the local police, not the FBI. Now we'll handle it. Trust me, okay? Good. When I get back to Washington, we'll take a lunch. Right. Take care. (phone clicks in receiver) Smithfield's throwing jurisdiction at me. - Stanton's calling to get clearance for a lock manufacturer. They found a safe deposit key at Dewberry's house. - Do we have a surveillance team on 'em? - Yes, sir. - Give him the clearance. (tense dramatic music) (tense music) - Thank you. (lid rattles open) (objects clatter) (papers rustle) Beaumont Storage. - Bob? Will I see you again? - I don't know. - I'd like you to know, I think you're a wonderfully exciting man, and that's a real rarity these days. Almost every guy I meet is pure plastic. I'd like you to call me anytime. (laughs) (door opens) (light clicks on) (footsteps shuffle) - (sighs) Let's get started. - Okay. (objects clatter) - Bingo. - Double bingo. Hi. Earl Dickman thought you guys might need some help. We have a van outside for this stuff. - We're fine here. - But he said bring it in. - (sighs) We wanna go through it. - No, he said now, and you don't go through it. - Give him a call. I'm in charge here. I was given carte blanche. - Sorry, pal. You'll have to call him yourself. - I don't have the time. - Let's go, Toddy. (footsteps shuffle) (gun clicks) (tense music) - Am I in charge now? - Yes. - Put the boxes down. - We're on your side, remember? - Not so sure. I said put down the boxes. (box thuds) You boys know how to do this, don't you? (body thuds) Get his gun. Dropped on the floor. (guns thud) You boys can have your guns back when you get a note from Dickman. He'll know where to find us. (door whirs open) (footsteps shuffle) (doors whir closed) - Stanton found the journals. - Oh dammit. (sighs) Well, call the airport. We've gotta go to Santa Fe. (footsteps shuffle) (phone clicks) (buttons dial) (traffic hums) (heels clack) - [Marcus] There you are, Becky. - Thank you. - Thank you. What's your name? - Catherine. - Catherine. Okay. (pen scribbles) (muffled chatter) There you are. - Great, thank you. - I hope you like the book. (Catherine chuckles) Hi. (gunshot blasts) (Marcus grunts) (birds chirp) (heels clack) (Mary sighs) - There's nothing to eat in that kitchen, and I'm starving. - Again? - Well, I am programmed to eat three meals a day. I'm also programmed to get eight hours of sleep a night. - You can eat and sleep later. Here, there's only three left. Listen to this one. "Paul Clemens is starting up a lobby in Washington to reduce military spending by 50% over the next seven years. This poor misguided excuse of a scientist is going to get us all nuked." Here's another. "Senator Stanhouse is at it again. He's working his butt off to kill the MX. They should stuff him in a warhead and target him for Moscow." - (sighs) That's Professor Clemens, nuclear scientist, and Senator Stanhouse from Michigan. - How many is that? - 15. - To say Dewberry was paranoid's an understatement. The only thing missing is voices coming out of the radiator. He's killing off influential people who don't happen to share his point of view. (page shuffles) Listen to this. "There is a faction in the agency, pressuring Washington to appoint Calvin Lantz as director. If that happens, we can kiss the country goodbye." Calvin Lantz is Mr. America. Did you find something? - No. - I'm gonna call Lantz. (footsteps shuffle) (buttons click) (soft music) - How long have you known Lantz? - He recruited me out of Northwestern University. He was the head of the Mideastern section then. - Are you friends? - I don't know. If you can have a friend in this line of work, yeah. Yeah, Calvin's my friend. (door opens) (soft tense music) (birds chirp) You brought a note from Dickman. - We got Dickman. (phone clicks in receiver) (footsteps shuffle) - Just calling you, Cal. - What's the matter with you, Henry? We made a deal, full authority, full support, total access. Dickman tried to rescind that deal. - Well, Earl? - Yes, sir. I thought it would be better if the agency had those journals. - You made a mistake. Have you read them all? - Most of 'em. There's a list of 16 potential victims. You're on the list, Cal. - (sighs) Will you men wait outside, please? (footsteps shuffle) (door shuts) - Is Marcus Baines' name on that list? - Yeah. - Golem killed him yesterday. (tense discordant music) - May I see the list? - Better add your name to it. - Hardly a rogue's gallery. How would Golem be programmed to continue? - Probably geographical location. - You mean if he's in LA, he kills off his quota and then goes elsewhere. - Not necessarily. Baines lived and worked in Washington. If Golan was programmed to kill him, he'd go wherever reasonable to do the job. If he starting in Washington, Senator Corbin is next on the list. - Corbin hates the agency! (traffic hums) - What are you trying to pull, Lantz? Huh? This smells as kosher as a roast suckling pig. - Sorry you feel that way, senator. But when we discover that a member of Congress is in danger, it is our responsibility to protect him. - Your responsibility is not protection. It is the gathering of intelligence, although I must say intelligence is greatly lacking in your organization of late. Come in! (door opens) (door shuts) Mr. Smithfield. - Senator. - [Senator Corbin] Sorry to drag you out on a Saturday. Hello, Cal. - Oliver. - Sit down. Lantz here claims that my life is in danger from one of his agents. - Is this the psycho in LA, Cal? - Mm-hmm. - Well, I'll contact Secret Service. - Well, why? We can handle it. - Bottom line, this is not agency jurisdiction. (tense music) (Calvin sighs) (car hums) (door opens) (door shuts) (muffled chatter) (hand smacks hood) (dramatic music) I thought my speech went very well, but if I need another chicken dinner, I'm gonna throw up feathers. (laughs) (tire blow) (tires screech) - Blew a tire! (tire blows) (tires screech) Zeke, you lost us! (glass shatters) (gunshot blasts) (tires screech) (dark brooding music) (footsteps shuffle) - I want this guy's name, I want a dossier on him, and I wanna know how the hell a guy can hang onto the bottom of a limo doing 50 miles an hour. - His name is Robert Golem, his dossier is missing, and he can do what he does because we trained him. Now do me a favor and back off. - A US senator has been killed. That's my jurisdiction. - (laughs) Don't wave the Constitution at me. - I'm not only waiving the constitution, but if I don't get what I am asking for, I'm going right to the president. (siren wails in distance) (car approaches) - Give me a minute. (footsteps shuffle) (doors open and close) Well, an old pal of mine. This toy soldier is squeezing my jugular. Help me out here, will you? - Tell the truth. - Professor Hoberman's the next name on that list. What if Golem couldn't find him? Would that stop the program? - What, you mean hide him so well that Golem can't find him? - Exactly. - It wouldn't work. Any good program would take an impossibility into consideration. You just move on to the next victim. - Well, what are you getting at? - Bait. - Oh, forget it. You can't ask me to ask Hoberman to act as a decoy. - I wasn't thinking about him. I was thinking about the next name on that list. That's you, Cal. (tense music) (birds chirp) (van rumbles) (door opens) (footsteps shuffle) - What you're about to hear is top secret. There are probably individuals here who will disagree with my decision to tell you this, but I like to be honest with my people. There was an assassin on his way here to kill me. This assassin is a robot. - What? (men laugh) - It's no joke. - You guys can die laughing, or you can listen and live. (bird calls) (hammers bang) (shovel hits dirt) How's it going? - How deep you wanna go with this, 20 feet? I saw that thing jump. - It's not to trap him. It's to hide us. Golem's got infrared vision. He can detect body heat unless we camouflage it. - Well, I'd hate to be hiding in here if that thing decides to stumble in. - Every position's being set up to cover each other. - That's a great comfort. (shovel hits dirt) - How much time is left? - I'm only guessing, but if I wanted the program to be efficient, I wouldn't waste more than 48 hours before moving onto the next target. - At least we've got that much. (dark brooding music) (birds chirp) (crickets chirp) We've got the back door and the front door covered and the perimeter. - Well, yeah, but he can come through any of the windows. He can bust through a wall. - We'll try not to shoot each other in the crossfire. What is this? - I thought we'd put these around the periphery of the property. That way we wouldn't have to worry what direction he's coming from. - What if some neighbor kid uses this yard as a shortcut? Get this outta here. (explosives thud) (light clicks on) (footsteps shuffle) (cases thud) - You know what I think, Earl? - I don't care what you think. (footsteps shuffle) (owl hoots) (crickets chirp) - Sh! - Hey, remind me to bring a pillow tomorrow night. - Sh! They say this thing can hear you breathing at 20 feet. - It's not even supposed to be here for another day. - Yeah? What if they're wrong? (footsteps shuffle) (soft pleasant music) - Thank you. - It's so peaceful. I wish it didn't have to change. - Like to fish? - I've never tried it. - Now that is peaceful. I'd like to take you fishing. - I'd like that. - Would you do me a favor? Would you leave here tomorrow? - No. - You've done all you can do. - No. Not till Golem's destroyed. - I'd feel a lot better if- - If what? If you didn't have to worry about me? - Yeah. - Let's get something straight. I don't cook, wash dishes, fetch slippers, or scream over mice, spiders, or peeping toms. In short, I paddle my own canoe. - And bait your own hook. - Mm-hmm. Can you accept that? Say yes. (Mary chuckles) (dark brooding music) (phone rings) (soft tense music) - Professor Hoberman's office. - May I speak with the professor, please? - I'm sorry, Professor Hoberman's not in. - Thank you. I'll try him at home. - No, I'm afraid you won't be able to reach him there either. He's out of the country for the next three weeks. - May I ask where he might be reached? - He's on a safari in Kenya, but he will be calling in at the end of next week. May I give him a message? - No, thank you. I'll try him again. (phone clicks) (birds chirp) (phone rings) - Mr. Lantz's office. - Beth, this is Jack Sweeney. - [Beth] Hello, Mr. Secretary. I'm afraid Mr. Lantz is out of town for a few days. - [Jack] Where can I reach him? - [Beth] He left orders not to be disturbed. - [Jack] I hardly think that includes me. - [Beth] (laughs) I'm sure he didn't mean you. He's in Santa Fe, 505-555-2020. (dial tone sounds) (buttons click) - On your earliest flight to Santa Fe. A one-way ticket, please. Will you also reserve a car for me at the airport? (car whooshes past) (crickets chirp) (footsteps shuffle) (footsteps thud) (item clicks) (footsteps thud) (door shuts) - I was talking to Brad at the base. They've been cataloging through Dewberry's journals. There seems to be one missing. - (sighs) What year? - '78. Is it important? (sighs) You think Stanton's hiding it? - No, Casallas. I want it. - Yes sir. (door opens) (footsteps shuffle) (door opens) (footsteps shuffle) (door shuts) (car hums) (dark brooding music) (brake clicks) (door opens) (door shuts) (bag thuds) (objects shuffle) (Todd sighs) (dramatic music) (Todd cries out) (Todd gags) (bags shuffle) (crickets chirp) (purse unzips) (door opens) - What are you doing? - Government property. - Put it back. - Sorry. (footsteps shuffle) (body thuds) (Mary grunts) (Earl cries out) (body thuds) (journal slides) That's government property. - That journal belongs to the government agency, Henry. - [Henry] What were you doing with it? - That's no problem. Just hand it over. (gunshots blast) (dramatic music) (footsteps shuffle) - Keep him in Kreiger's section. - Try him. - Kreiger? Kreiger? Kreiger? (static hisses) He's not answering. - So much for our surprise. Will Golem run? - No, he's programmed for Lantz. He won't leave till he's killed him. (dramatic suspenseful music) (crickets chirp) (footsteps stomp) - It's dark in here. Let's see if we can light him up. (lights click on) (soft tense music) - Front of the house. (leaves rustle) - I'll check it out. - Be careful. - Thank you, Mother. (leaves rustle) (dramatic music) It's Kreiger. - Get outta there! (dramatic suspenseful music) (gunshots blast) (man screams) - Fire! (gunshots blast) (bullets ricochet) (crickets chirp) (gunshots blast) (lights shatter) (slow tense music) - Do you see him? (footsteps shuffle) - Nothing. (window shatters) (Becker cries out) (gunshots blast) (Gatz grunts) (tense discordant music) - Becker? Gatz? Becker? (gunshots blast) (lights shatter) (crickets chirp) (footsteps shuffle) (tense dramatic music) (gunshots blast) (body thuds) - I got him! I got him! (dramatic music) (footsteps shuffle) - [Mary] Slocum? Slocum? (leaves rustle) (crickets chirp) (knife whooshes and thuds) (dramatic music) (body thuds) (tense music) - Hello, Mary. - Hello, Bob. - I thought you'd be there. I hope you'll understand that my attempt on your life was not personal. - I understand. - Good. It was a program override after 48 hours. You're no longer my objective. Calvin Lantz is. (static hisses) - We can't let you have him. - You disappoint me, Mary. Let me speak with Henry Stanton. (static hisses) - You know my name? - I know everything about you, Henry. Six men are dead out here. Do you want more to die? - No. - Good. Then give me Lantz. - [Henry] No. - You're not being logical, Henry. He's only one man, and you of all people have no reason to protect him. He betrayed you. - Come on, Henry. Don't listen to him. - Betrayed is an interesting word. It wasn't in your dossier. I had to cross index with the Dewberry assassination list. He made the bomb for the Bomati assassination under Calvin Lantz's instructions. - I know that. - But what you didn't know is that the bomb was set to detonate at 35,000 feet. Hardly the setting for a small private plan, right, Henry? (static hisses) - Destroying Golem is the priority. (journal thuds) - He was an important design. Look, you were getting a conscience. I couldn't take a chance on telling the truth. You might've turned us down. It had to be done! - What you did to me. You're not done with him! - Henry, please. - Don't. Don't talk. Don't speak. Don't move. - [Robert] Send him on out here, Henry. Not worth saving. - Dickman, get him outta here. (footsteps shuffle) (door opens) (footsteps shuffle) (door shuts) (tense brooding music) If I wanted him dead, I would've killed myself. - [Robert] You're a fool. - I'm not a machine. (tense dramatic music) (footsteps shuffle) (tense discordant music) (footsteps shuffle) (door thuds) (footsteps shuffle) (door opens) (footsteps shuffle) (floorboards crack) (dramatic music) (gunshot blasts) (gunshots blast) (door slams) (door opens) (footsteps shuffle) (gunshots blast) (door bangs open) (door bangs open) Stay back. (gunshot blasts) (gun thuds) (body crashes into table) (body bangs into shelf) (fist thuds) (gunshot blasts) (door bangs shut) (fists bang) Scram! He'll self destruct. (electronic whirs whine) - That's where the mines are. - Run! (electronic whirring intensifies) (explosion booms) (fire roars) (soft music) (Mary cries) - There aren't any more around like him, are there? - No, I think. (sniffles) No. (sniffles) (dramatic music)
