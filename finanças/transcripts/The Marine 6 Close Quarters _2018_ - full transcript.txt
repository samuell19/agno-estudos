Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER *** You're tipping your shoulder before you throw the right. The hell I am. - When's tip-off? - Eight. That's your pre-game? That place's a rip-off. I'm not spending eight bucks on a beer. I got a shift in the morning, so we should probably take it easy tonight. Yeah. All right. Where are the seats? - They're ain't court-side. - [INDISTINCT] I was your C.O. We did two tours together. Hell, I took a bullet for you! You oughta know me better than that. There! You did it again! There's a place over on Franklin. Three dollar draft. Pretty decent wings. That place is a dump. Yeah, I'm not exactly swimming in EMT money, all right? My job at the VA barely covers my tab. I'm telling you, you're tipping your strike. I can see it coming a mile away. Did you see that one? Nope. - You still hit like a girl. - There's nothing wrong with that. Cool. You're done? I'm not the one getting my ass kicked. I taught you that. I know. All right. Come on. We're gonna be late. Coffee's on you. What else is new? Good morning, Portland! We start the hour with an update from the Horace Hayes trial. Kelly? Yes, good morning, Tom. Well, there certainly is a nervous energy in the air today with closing arguments being read in the Horace Hayes trial... and deliberations set to begin this afternoon. Well, many members of the community fear another hung jury and the possibility of Hayes walking free. The prosecution certainly seemed confident as they convened in the hallway. And any updates on the rest of the alleged Irish crime family? Yes, they pressed the District Attorney to... [PHONE RINGS] - Hey! - Yo, when's your Dad back? I don't know. Whenever they reach a verdict. So, you've got the house to yourself tomorrow night? Yeah... but no, not gonna happen. - What? - You know what! - I'm not having people over. - Why not? - We've got finals next week, for one... - What if I invited Andrew? - My Dad would kill me! - He'll never know. That's not the point. We'll keep it low-key. Okay, fine. But just a couple of people. That's it. I'm serious. Yes! I'll see you at practice. Can I help you? Get in the car, Sarah. How do you know my name? Circle around! - Where the fuck did she go? - That way. Go! Come on, Sarah. We're not gonna hurt you. Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! I got her, Maddy! Get off me! You should have got in the car. What do you want from me? Put him on. Someone wants to say hi. - Sarah! - Dad! - Oh, my God! Sarah! - Hey! Dad! Patrick, your daughter's gonna be fine. We just need to talk about my father's trial. What do you want from me? You hang the Jury, or we'll hang your girl. Get her in the car. Thanks for coming out with me today, man. - I appreciate it. - No worries. It's not like it was my day off or anything. Come on, you might as well get out and help some people out. Yeah, yeah... Happy to help. I just didn't know the old DVA made house calls. Normally we don't. Usually they have got me sitting behind a desk filing claims. Can't stand being in the office. But every now and then, they let me get out, make a few rounds, check-in on some vets. I'm good with people. - So, who are we checking on today? - Tommy. Nam vet, won a Purple Heart. Squatting in this building for two years. Can't seem to get him out. Does he have any family? No, not anymore. I got a place set up for him and everything, but... I can't get through to him. What makes you think he'll listen to me? Remember a kid named Robert Walker? Served with you in Afghanistan? Yeah, Robbie, the sniper attached to our unit. Killed by roadside just outside of in Kabul. Why? He's his father. This place looks like a war zone. Wait til you see the inside. Oh, hey, and heads-up about Graham. He's a little touchy, but he's all right. He works for the landlord. You're late! I've been waiting out here for an hour! It's nice to see you too, Graham. Fuck you! He seems nice. People actually live out here? Oh, yeah. This place is a squatter's paradise. Nobody tells them what to do, and they get to run the land. In the middle of nowhere. Yap. Old Tom likes living off the grid. What's in the bag? Just a little care package. Bread, ding-dong, stuff like that. Who's this guy? This is my buddy Jake. He's helping me out today. How you doing? Huh? Terrible, I said I'm doing... I said I'd help but... - I don't like sitting around all day. - Take it easy, Graham. We're gonna be in and out. All right. Let's get it over with. This place gives me the creeps. Yeah, I'm surprised they let you out here all by yourself today. I'm not worried. You got a permit for that thing? Of course! I got it last week. I hope you'll never need it. A lot better to have one and not need it. - Than not to have one... - Graham, do us a favor... Keep it in your pants, all right? Don't want you shooting me by accident. Ugh! It smells great in here. Man, it usually looks like a hobo hotel in this place. Where is everybody? No clue. Say Graham, when was the last time you were out here? A couple of months ago. Last time I let you in. Hello? Hello? Hello? Man, it looks like somebody cleared the place and kicked everybody out. Maybe they all got jobs. It seems they left in a hurry. They didn't even finish their dinner. It wasn't us. You know, it's not worth the trouble. We kick them out, they come back. We kick them out, they come back. Like a pack of strays. They're human beings. - Yeah, right... - Hey! If you don't care about this people, then why are you still here? We're big boys. We'll be all right. No, no, that's not how it works. I let you in, I let you out. - We don't a lawsuit... - Look, you two, cut it out. All right? We're on the same team. - Are you sure he's still here? - I hope so. He lives in a storeroom at the back. How did you find this guy in the first place? Graham called it in. He may be an asshole, but he's not a monster. Thank you. Easy there, Rambo, it's a raccoon. Graham, what did I say? That things isn't a toy! - No, but I saw... - Look... You pull the piece again, I'm gonna make you eat it. - We understand each other? - Yeah, yeah, I got it. Tommy, open up! Tommy, it's Luke! Come on, Tommy. All right. We're coming in. Hope you're decent! Whoa! Whoa, whoa! You ain't coming inside of nothing. This is my home. That's fine. Take it easy. I already told you I ain't going. You hear me? I ain't going! - You got something to say to me? - No, no, no! Not me. You can stay here for as long as you like. Tommy, look, I don't know what you're talking about. It's me, Luke, from the VA, we spoke last month. I'm still not leaving. That's fine. Why don't you put that thing down? Okay? Please. Put it down. It ain't even loaded. Maybe you shouldn't go pointing at people's faces. This is America, isn't it? I just wanted to check and see how you're doing. I brought you some food. - Who the hell are you? - I'm Jake Carter. Is that supposed to mean something to me? I served with your son in Afghanistan. Robbie? He was attached to my unit. Oh... He was a good boy. He was a good Marine. They brought him home in a box! Look, Tommy, why don't we sit down for a second and talk? No, I don't think so. Come on, man, we're just trying to help. Can't help. No one can help me. Just leave me be. I've asked you twice. I won't ask you again. That went well. - Well, at least he didn't shoot us. - Yeah. That's a plus. Oh, I gotta take this. Okay, come on. Time's up. Let's go. Yeah, I'll catch up with you. Hi! Yeah, this is he. Great. You're all right? Yeah, I just thought we had him for a second. - We can't save everyone, brother. - We can try. "No man left behind," right? That's what they taught us. We're not in the war anymore, man. I'm still a Marine. - [GIRL SCREAMING] - Come here! What's upstairs? Old office space. They usually don't squat upstairs 'cause the ceiling is leaking. All right. Let's go. Hi, yeah, listen... Yeah, send them over, and then I can... I'll pull them off... I'm sure... yeah, we can come up with a deal that's gonna be advantageous for the both of us. So, that's gonna be... That's gonna be great! Where do you wanna start? [GIRL GAGGING] Hey! Is everything all right in there? Freeze! Come on, we know you're in there. We can hear you! Just wanna make sure everything's all right. What do you think? Maybe Graham has a key? [HELP!] [YOU DO THAT AGAIN AND I WILL KILL YOU] You're up. It figures. - Can I help you? - You know what? We can see you're all eating dinner. We're interrupting, so, we're gonna... Are you okay? She's fine. We just had a little disagreement. I'd like to hear it from her, if you don't mind. Why not? Tell them, Sarah. - I'm fine. - See? She's fine. Maybe we should call the police, let them sort this out. - Oh, that won't be necessary. - I insist. [COCKS GUN] There's no need for the police, Jake. Maybe we should just be on our way out. Unbelievable. Move! - Take it easy! All right! - Just stay calm. Hey! You won't be needing this. Search them. Let's see who we're dealing with here. "Luke Trapper, Veteran Affairs." How noble of you. "Jake Carter, EMT." Oh, won't you look at that! Both of you are soldiers. - How cute. - Marines. Marines. Is that why you're out here kicking down doors? Trying to relive your glory days? Something like that. Well, you took the gun on this one, didn't you, chap? You guys ready? I wanna get out of here bef... - Don't move! - Whoa! Whoa! - Whoa! - Graham, put that thing away. You're gonna get us all killed. Listen to your friend, okay? I said don't move! Just let them go, please. That ship has sailed, Sarah. You should've kept your mouth shut. Have you ever shot that gun before? Stop, please. 'Cause it's got one hell of a kick. Stop talking. Plus... You left the safety on. [SCREAMS FRANTICALLY] Luke! - Come on! - Move it! - What was that, Jake? - No clue! Shit, we're trapped in here! - Are you all right? - No, no, no, no... Hey, hey, hey, hey... Look at me. Look at me. - They're gonna kill us. - No, they're not. We're not gonna let that happen, are we, Luke? Probably not. Come on! - What's your name? - Sarah. Right, Sarah. We're gonna get you out of here. You believe me, right? - Yeah. - Then say it. You're gonna get me out of here. - That's right. - How? Still working on that. I need a little help over here. Never mind. We're good. [GUNSHOT] Shit! Come on! Move it over here! Come here, come here! Get over here! - What? - We need her alive. - Yeah, I know that. - Then, why are you shooting at them? He broke John's hand. I don't care about John's hand. No more guns. We can't risk hitting the girl. Understood? Whatever you say, Maddy. Call my brother. Tell him to bring the boys. Until my father's verdict is in, we can't take any chances. What about them? Guard the door. It's a dead end. - They're not going anywhere. - Let's go! Here. Happy Birthday. Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury... you have witnessed ironclad proof of Horace Hayes' guilt. We have indisputable scientific evidence on the murder weapon, and CCTV images from the night of March 4th, showing Horace Hayes and his associates entering the building, where three of Portland's finest police officers were slain. Men with families and children... And beyond that, we've unveiled an extremely dangerous head of a crime family... with a far reach across the nation... To truly kill a snake, you must cut off his head. Now, go do what is right. Thank you, Your Honor. [TOILET FLUSHING] [RESTROOM DOOR OPENS] [FOOTSTEPS] - Hey. - Hey. Would you believe we're supposed to deliberate this shit? This is some asshole, isn't he? We're gonna find this guy guilty. - Wait, wait, Ben. - Yeah? No, nothing. Okay. Deliberation room three. Let's go. It's too high. We got to find a way out of here. I'm working on it. We got company. A squad or a platoon? Looks like the whole division. Hey, Sarah, do you want to tell us what these people want with you? My father's a Juror on the Horace Hayes trial. They want to mistrial. They're using me as leverage. - The Hayes family? - Yeah. This just keeps getting better and better. [YO, WE'RE HERE] Hey, Oscar, we got two Marines trapped up here. Clear the rest of the building. No one should be here except for you guys. Hey! Scout out the building. Make sure there isn't any more Marines wandering around. What are you talking about? Just do it. Marines? I'd stand back. We wanna give the all clear. Oh, wait, where are you going? You're up. I'm gonna kick your ass, man! Maddy! They're over here! Over here! You good? Yeah. We need a phone. I got one. Pass code. - Come on. - Don't lock it out. You can make an emergency call from the lock screen. - I don't see it. - Here, give it to me. - He must have blocked it. - Mine too. We gotta keep moving. Hey! I'm taking the girl... And you're dead. I owe you one. - Two by my count. - Two? Ramadi, '06. - I had that guy. - The hell you did. Give me a hand. We need to get to the truck. Okay. Come on! Keep your head down and keep swinging. Wait. We can't just go charging out there like Leroy Jenkins. We need a plan. Leroy who? It doesn't matter. If they know where we are, they'll be waiting for us. Then we'll just go through them. I'm sure you're probably like the baddest guys at the bar and all... But they have guns. We have a hammer. Look, the longer we sit here, the more them they're gonna be. We either keep moving or we die. I'm not going out there. He's right. We gotta keep moving, it's the only way. [KEEP LOOKING. NEXT ROOM] Maybe it's not. - Where does this lead? - The grain room. Lock it down. No one in, no one out. Go! Get the guys! [BLOCK THIS BREWERY DOWN] [NEXT STOREY DOWN] [COPY THAT] [INDISTINCT YELLING] [LET'S GO] [TWO SECURE] Come on. We're running out of time. Grain room is this way. No way to go. Luke, hurry! Ready or not, soldier boys! - How far down? - Far. Do you know where it lets out? There's only one way to find out. [LAST CHANCE, MARINES] [WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, HUH?] [EASY WAY? OR THE HARD WAY?] There's about ten feet diagonal fall by a long drop. Keep yourself waxed. Take it slowly. [COME ON, OPEN UP] Get in there! Come on, come on! All right, come one. You're up. Let's go. Yup. Take it easy. You can do it. You can do it, Sarah. Easy, easy, Sarah. You're doing great. Slowly. Just go. You're doing great, Sarah. We have to hurry! Not too fast. Keep pressing to the sides. Sarah, you can do this. Be calm. Nice and slow. [SCREAMS FRANTICALLY] Oh, shit! Jake? [BOTH SCREAM] Jake! Jake! Jake? We're good! I slipped. You think? Sorry. [WHISTLES TAUNTINGLY] Get up, man. Hey, Leatherneck! Catch! Oh, shit! Let's go, let's go! Luke! You're all right? Nope. Not at all. - Is it deep? - Yeah. - You should've caught me. - I didn't have enough time. You caught her. Oh, Jeez! Leave that be. Luke? It's better where it is. It's easy for you to say. - Yeah, I really wouldn't do that. - Don't! [SCREAMS IN PAIN] I think I'm gonna throw up. You're a stubborn son of a bitch, you know that? Could you hand me that? I'm gonna try to stop the bleeding. [HEY, SOLDIER BOYS! WE'RE COMING FOR YOU!] I'm gonna kill that guy. It's that way. Oh, shoot. All right, look. It's not that bad. Yo! - I thought you finished that guy. - So did I. Look, just give us the girl and you two can walk away. That's not gonna happen. You just met her. You can't be that attached. I guess we're gonna find out. Round two. I get this one. You get beef kick over there. No! Get off! Stop screaming! - I got three. - So did I. - I got the big one. - Horse shit! This guy had a cattle prod. Look. Thanks, Graham. Come on. This way. - It's chain shot. - Let the big bull charge. You shouldn't be setting that shoulder on anything. Whoa, whoa! Why don't you let me worry about that? We need to stop the bleeding. Well, buddy, why don't you drop me by the old case back on the way out here? Are you guys serious? I thought the thing wasn't loaded. It is now. We need your help. Funny how that works. Please. All right. Come on, now. Maddy and her brother kicked everyone out of here last week. And they just let you stay? Yeah, I guess I'm one stubborn S.O.B. God! - You're telling me? - Do you have a first aid kit? I need gauze, disinfectant, whatever you got. Son, I don't even got electricity. - Where do you...? - Hey, don't touch my stuff! Seriously, though... where did you find all this? Goodwill, garbage cans, dumpsters... Oh, why'd you save it all? Well, it don't seem right, throwing it all away. People died for that flag. How does it look? Around your neck it's thoracic. There's too much blood. I can't be sure. You need a hospital. - That isn't an option. - Luke, I'm serious. This is bad. For once in your life, just listen to me. You could bleed out. Remember Helmand, '09? No more stories, Luke. We don't have time. I gotta think. We got cut off. Pinned down. They said no one goes out. - Slick Willy, he took one on the gut. - Yeah, I remember. It was something, huh? Field cook? Bingo. Have you a spare round? Man, just dump the whole thing in there. I want to do this twice. I'm trying to minimize the damage. So, this actually works? Sometimes. - And is it safe? - Oh, I didn't say that. How are you two still alive? Good question. For the pain. I don't like to drink alone. You're not gonna ask me twice. To Robbie. Yeah, all right. To Robbie. All right, light me up, Doc. Are you ready for this? No, but do it anyway. We'll find them, Maddy. Excuse me? I said we'll find them. Make them pay. But, you've already found them... Twice by my count. You told us not to use guns. I did say that, didn't I? We could've stopped this, we could... You shouldn't need guns. Maddy, wait, wait... And where were you? Securing the exits. Like you asked. - And they got out. - They didn't. Then, where are they? Just make sure you have a clear shot. I wouldn't want you to end up like Rooney. I'll kill them myself. She lives. They die. - Yeah. - Good. Get in here. What are you looking at? I told you it'd work. You'll need antibiotics when we get out of here. I still got a couple left over from that ear infection. - I'll take them when I get home. - No. You need a real doctor, real medicine. Just promise me you'll to hospital. - All right. Relax. - And now, we're even. Whoa, whoa! This takes care of saving your life upstairs. You still owe me for these two. How could I forget? Now, could you put something on so we can get out of here? Well, this is all I got. Oh, nice T-shirt, grandma. Don't let me die in this thing. We're not dying in here. Is there a back way out of this place? Something that they don't know about? There are some old tunnels. They lead the docks. Where's the entrance? There's a dead phone in the loading bay. But I don't know what shape the tunnels are in. What do you think? Better than staying in here. Can you take us there? One more patrolling ain't gonna hurt me. Let's just hope this doesn't turn into a combat mission. We'll need this. Now... Attention! Fall in, men. Stay together. Keep close. Hey, Tommy. How come you never let me get you out of that place? Huh? I made my own bed. I'm man enough to light it. You're even more stubborn than I am. Hey. Look, guys, take the old man's room. - You... stay with me. - I don't see 'em. [GUYS] [IT'S ALL CLEAR] Wait. Shhhhhh... [RAT SQUEAKING] [SARAH SCARES] [METALLIC SOUND] Maybe they didn't hear us. [CAN MAKES NOISE ON FLOOR] Run! Don't hit the girl! Get this off me! Over here! Luke, come on! We got 'em on out tail. I'm just gonna slow them down a bit. We got a problem. That's the entrance to the tunnels. Don't tell me that. - The car's right on top of it. - Of course it is. Put it in neutral. - Get up! - Go, move it! Go! Are you up for this, old man? Shut up and push. In-coming! - Is it in neutral? - I don't know! - What do you mean "You don't know?" - I drive a Prius! I'm gonna die in this shirt. Take the clutch! - Which one is it? - The left one! Sarah, get out. Let's go! At the side, at the side! - A little help over here! - Working on it! I got it. Keep your head down. She made it. Get ready to move! Now! How many are there? Two! No, five! Where are you going? I got one left! I'm out! Move forward! Luke! Run! Please, work! - Did you see that? - It's hard to miss. Tommy! Okay... Tommy, come here. Come. [SCREAMS IN PAIN] Hang in there, buddy. Hang on, okay? You're gonna be all right. Just keep breathing. Don't lie to me, kid. I know a kill shot when I see it. Come on. I've seen worse. Yeah, I'm a dead man. We just need you to get you out of here. No. No, no... I'm fine right here. Wait, wait, wait... Take this for me. It was Robbie's. Now... Finish your mission, Marine. Semper fi. Grab a gun. Let's finish this. They're in the tunnels. Those tunnels lead to the docks. Call Kat, make sure she's waiting for them. You get down there and drive them to us. - What are you gonna do? - What you couldn't. This trial's been going on for 13 days. - Man, I wanna go home. - Yeah, so do I. Then, repeat after me: "Guilty." Look, I'm sorry. I just don't see it that way, okay? They killed cops, Patrick. - Cops. - Allegedly. No, not allegedly. It's right there in black and white. Look! You have a daughter, right? You don't want this monster on the street with her... Do you? No, I don't. But you have my vote. And I'm not gonna change my mind. Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER *** So, what do they call these things again? Shanghai tunnels. Downtown is littered with them. I didn't think they ran way out here. I'm surprised they haven't filled them in by now. They're a big deal. I did a paper on them for my EP Lit class. They used to do tours and stuff. Oh, great. Maybe we'll run in a tour group while we're down here. They can schlep us out of here. Oh, no, I don't think so. Why is that? Oh, well, two years ago a tunnel collapsed on a tour group Killed three people, so... They don't run them anymore. It's just too dangerous. Hey, do us a favor... Keep that shit to yourself until we get out of here, huh? Yeah, yeah, sure. Sorry. [RATS SQUEAKING] - What's up, Kat? - Yeah, we're in. We're gonna chase them for you. You got this? Don't worry about it, sweetheart. I'll bury those boys down here. Let's go. Another dead end. What do you think? Eenie, Meenie, Miney, mo... Better than the thing I got. Hey, shut off your lights for a second? Why would we do that? Because if it's dark enough, maybe we'll see daylight and you know, find our way out of here? Worth a shot. Look, the last time I listened to her, I got hit in the head, fell down a grain chute, and then impaled on a steel rod. [WHISTLING TAUNTINGLY] Looks like they already found us. No, they know we're down here, but they don't know where we are. They must have heard us or saw our flash lights. No, if they saw us, we'd be dead already. Hey... - See? I told you! - Sarah! That ain't daylight, kid. Come on! - Whoa! Whoa! - Back up! Chill out, man. Chill out. She might be one of them. One of what? No, no, come on, - She ran into me. I didn't touch her. - Shhhh! What are you doing down here? We were squatting upstairs. We got kicked out. I've been living down here ever since. And you just wander the tunnels by yourself? I heard an explosion. I came to check it out. That's all. - Could you lower that thing? - Not yet. - You have a phone? - No. I don't know you are but right now I don't care. But you're gonna lead us out of here. - Can you do that? - Yeah. Come on. It's this way. You really think she looks like a squatter? I didn't say that. But it's either her or those guys. She's not the one shooting at us. - Yet. - Just keep your eyes open. This way. How much further? Not much. I promise. So, you live down here by yourself? No, just me and a couple friends. Uh-huh. What's your name? - Kat. - Kat. How come you and your friends didn't move to another building instead of living down here like rats? We like our privacy. Nobody bothers us down here. Uh-huh... Almost there. [PHONE RINGS] I thought you didn't have a phone. Yeah, I was lying about that, actually. What else are you lying about? Well, this isn't the way out, for one. - I knew we couldn't trust her. - Yeah. Hey, boys! Get down! No! Sarah! Don't worry, sweetie. We're gonna shoot her in the head and then dump her body in the harbor. It'll be painless. Are you good? What are you gonna do with that, jarhead? Improvise. Adapt. Overcome. They got Sarah. Not for long. I feel a breeze. Clear! We got an exit. Go! Go! Hey! I got them! Shit! We found you! - I thought you said it was clear! - It was! Well, looks like we're not gonna make it for tip-off. Never were. Hell, I don't even like basketball. I just bought those tickets to get you into coming out with me today. You could've just asked me. I hate owing people favors! - [WE GOT THEM PINNED] - We'll call it even. Yeah. - [DON'T WASTE YOUR AMMO] - I don't like being owed. Shit! I can't believe it. After six tours, I'm gonna die in a tunnel with another man's rifle. [COME ON OUT, GUYS. WE GOT YOU SURROUNDED] Hey. Remember Kunjak? You're telling stories now? I thought that was my thing. You took two bullets in the gut covering my retreat. I was your C.O. My job was to keep you alive. That was a tactical retreat. Exactly. Jesus, Jake. [I THINK THEY'RE OUT!] [GO GET THEM] [THEY'RE STILL HERE. GET UP!] Are you all right? Get Sarah. Finish this. Don't do it, Jake. Don't you do it! We're even. No! No! Jake! No! Good-bye, Marine. [JAKE!] [SHOTS FIRED] - Where does that come out? - No idea. You two, find him! - What about me? - We got a boat to catch. You didn't have to kill him! Luke's not gonna let you get away with this. He's gonna find you! Then I'll put him in the ground too. Sarah... If this dude's got a brain, he's halfway to Portland by now. It's a waste of time. Let's get to the boat. [PSSST] Here, take her. Let's go. I wonder how the trial's going. Now, will you look at that? "Hung Jury. Judge declares mistrial on all counts. Horace Hayes to walk." Looks like your Daddy pulled through for you after all. Then let me go. We did what you ask. We won't tell anyone, please. Oh, sweetheart, you should know me better than that by now. You're a loose end and so is your Daddy. Bitch. - Take her on board. - My pleasure. Kill him! Hey! Hey! Get off me! - What's going on? - Go, go, go! - What about the others? - Now! Luke! Nice shirt. Did you happen to bring my knife by any chance? No. But I know where you left it. Oh, I owe you better, sweetheart. He can keep it. So, was that your plan? Jump on the boat and beat the poor little woman into submission, huh? Honestly, I'm just kind of making this up as I go. Oh, I expected more from you. This is a fight you can't win, Marine. I've never really been good at losing. Oh, what are you gonna do with that, huh? Just a little something a friend taught me. No, no, no! No! Translation and subtitles by PEPPER & LALASPAIN *** SONG LIVES FOR EVER *** So, end with it. Let me get this straight. You killed all these men? More or less. But where's Miss Hayes now? At the bottom of the ocean? Are you sure? I put her there. What about Horace? Does he just walk? Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. I think they got a whole sue of new charges for him. Sarah! Sarah? - Dad! - I'm sorry, baby! We'll pick this up later. I'm okay, I'm fine. I'm fine. Thanks to him. Hey, thank you. Thank you. The officers told me what you did. I don't know what we would have done. - It wasn't just me. - Soldier coming through. Hey, give me a second? Semper fi, brother. We're even. - Just give me a second. - Sure. How are you doing? I was gonna ask you the same thing. Just saying good-bye. I'm so sorry about Jake. You know, he'd do all again tomorrow? Even knowing the outcome. He died a Marine. I should probably go to the hospital. Yeah, I think that's probably a good idea. Hey. Come on, we gotta get you home, okay?
