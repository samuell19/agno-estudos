But we'll be buddies, huh? - Lalalala ... I can not hear you. - I brought you something! This sweet teddy ... - He is very sensitive, because his organs are upside down! - Oh! Fred, if we have a real family want to be, then ... Mara, that's all I want. Maybe you do not have it yet found the right access to him. I know him for 2 minutes. - Maybe it is too early ... Mara, give me a chance I can do it! This does not look good. Okay, then show him you're there for him are! - Okay. That you love him as much as me! - Okay. The referees discuss and apparently ... Incredible! The litter counts! This is new hall record! We all know, which ritual is next: The visit of the tribune our friends with disabilities! Why do these Spastis always get the ball? - Sweetheart, Spasti is a password. That means physically disabled people. Yes? - That's completely unfair! Why always get these behindis the whole balls? Fred, why do not you explain that to him? Come on! One often has the feeling that disabled people are preferred. For example, the whole Disabled Parking ... which are always empty anyway. Or the handicapped ward. But you must not be jealous, because disabled people do not jump, run ... What do you want with the ball? Rummage around on it? Fool your son! He hates me. - No! I wish for my birthday a ball from Mercurios record season. That's what I wish for more than anything else in the world! I think I know someone who can get the ball! Right, Fred? She marries you when you get the ball procure? - Do not you understand anyway. You are hot on the daughter of the boss. But why all the stress, just to marry the old woman? Mara sees something big in me. - There's nothing big about you, man. I have to get the ball! Think about it! (Bubock) Mr. Krüppers? - Him again! Yes? (Bubock) There is a problem! The handicapped pedestal may after the Ramp heel should not be shorter than 1.20 m. Your podiums are all 15 cm too short. Then the ramp goes over the sidewalk! Should I reset the house 15 cm? It's not the city's job To solve your problems. We are only obliged to Find out irregularities. When I rebuild the ramp, it costs me a week! It's not the city's job to pay attention to your appointments. We are just ... - Close your eyes! We're building a dance studio. Traffic on this ramp will be limited. Good.

Everyone can buy the ball in the fan shop. - That's true, but for that the whole crew has signed on it. Either a real ball from Mercurio or forget Mara! Handkerchief? - Thank you. Such a ball you can not just buy on eBay. I say that you have touched me. - What? That you have groped my cock. - I think'... Can I have my pants back? There are your DNA traces on it. - That's enough! Mami! - Well, you two! Fred gets me a real ball from Mercurios record season for a birthday. Na girls, go for a strike?

I can not help it, that you have stress with Mara. Hey, it works perfectly with Mara. Perfect. Then it's good. Look, I've had it done! Here! Hard to believe. - I do not mean to say so. I do not know if you can specify but then we'll pack your things. Not so fast, Fred! Alright? - It's okay, Fred. I'm in the movie and Mercurio will shake my hand immediately. I am at the destination and you are free! I can not possibly stand in front of Mercurio like that. I have nothing right to wear! But do not stain it! - very soft! Now we get to know the fans, that are close to our hearts. The boys are already excited. That is clear, I am also Benno Held. Where is Mr. Müller? - He hurt himself. (Benno) What should I do? - Talk to Ronnie and Fred. These are the tablets that - Where are the cardboard? What can I say? Mr. Held, we do not sell vacuum cleaners here. Why do I have to explain you your job? No text, no entertainment! I am Benno Held, manager of 'Service direct 'and former basketball pro. And these are fans, Alba can only dream of. What's your name, my boy? Ron ... Ron ... Ron ... Ron ... Stop! It's shit. I told you, I do not want to see any human tragedies. (Computer voice) He is excited. - What do you want? You already understood me. - Do not get excited! OK? I said, werbefilmbehindert! - I am not disabled! I can go, I just do not want to! - Sure, of course. (Benno whispers) Is not he very close? (Ronnie) You stupid sack! (Denise) Oh god! (Benno) Let go! - Arrogant bag! Do not touch me, you crippled freak! (Reporter) Do you have that? Mr. Held should now have trouble the words "Do not touch me Turn that shit off! Why are today all so damn sensitive? The Bureau is very nervous about it. If I lose the budget, you fly out! Ok, next Sunday's show titled: "Disabled fans are special fans". You're walking across the field, Hand in hand with disabled children. A glorious wheelchair parade. And then Mercurio hands over his last signed ball the disabled fan who caught him: Fred cripple man. The guy's name is Krüppelmann? Oh, shit, there's a god! That's not bad. Julia! Fred, you will be the star of the show. Thousands of fans will be there how Mercurio hands you the ball! That is wonderful! Fred, are you happy? No! (Alex) Of course he means yes. No. - He has disappeared. I'm getting out, Alex. - You can not get off. That's cheating. - I'm fucking ... We are in a hurry. - Hurry, for what? Your fiancé has us invited to dinner. Is this a good idea? Yes. We are so excited on your family life. Or? Of course. - Shit, today is Thursday? I have an appointment. We meet at Mara! aaaa (Timid Tiger, "Miss Murray") That's no problem for me. I can separate private and professional. Fred is coming soon. Stop it! But he is in a wheelchair. - What? He pretends to be handicapped, to get this ball! Really? - Yes, but he will not get it until tomorrow. So he had this week to play the disabled. Plays with or he can not get the ball! Shit, I can not stay here. Huh? (Computer voice) Hello honey! - Oh. You are sitting in a wheelchair. As always! Yes, then ... please. Linus, look who's there! Fred is here. Shut up, Face Slapping! He always makes him laugh. Fred pulled one of his faces. Fred, do it again! - Ehhhh (Mara) That was funny. We laugh so much. The food is almost ready. Let's sit down! Fred, you are sitting here! But there's a chair you do not need, so I cleared it away quickly. huch I put him in the broom cupboard. Is he stupid in the head? - No, but he can not speak. OK. Let us eat! - (door chime) Who is that? Maybe your parents, You have invited them too, right? Do not you want to open? I'll open it, will you? (Denise) Hello!

It was great, Fred working to watch on the construction site. Yes? - Mmh An office would be better for him. - view I think so too. The Schäuble is also in a wheelchair. The work on the construction site he is fun! That's not for him. He fits much better in an office. Disabled are the better people, because they are not so fixated on themselves. I'll take it! What was that? - Alex is hiding in the broom cupboard. He does not! - He does well! Alex? Are you in the broom cupboard? Yes. What are you doing there? Surprise! I was in there the whole time. Tricked! I have you there but crazy, hey? Good joke. - That was his idea. Fred is the king of pranks! We made it! Please stop! - Witzbold! Hello, I am Alex, the keeper of Fred. - Hello! Oh, tight grip. Well, the two are not a cute couple? Oh God! - Please not here, Karl! Many Thanks. - With pleasure. Goodbye. You played the disabled for a week? - Yes. Behind my back? Just to get the basketball? - Clear. So Fred, if that is not love, then then I do not know what love is. But especially bright is not the Popnik. I had my doubts if we match, but I am sure now. When Linus has his ball Is not it enough that we love each other? We will do that, otherwise we would but do not do so much for each other! Do you still get wine from the cellar? Are you ready for the new star? (all) Yes. Benno hero! These are fans, Alba can only dream of. (Alex) This is Fred, the biggest fan. (Ronnie) Hey! What shoud that? Hello! Help! What is that here? Can you help me? Kakomio, What is this device for? They cut everything out - Which was unnecessary. Yes that's me. You are a pompous asshole! He broke his contract. You're going to pay, Fred Krüppelmann! Do not you have eyes in your head? This is a disabled parking lot. (Alex) Shit, you're stuck! Stand still! Ow! - You are stuck! (Benno) Take a seat! Unless you prefer to stand. Well, you ass! In my whole life I have never seen something so morally depraved. You know, What do I want to do with you? I want to show everyone what 'the scum' Fred Krüppelmann is for a human being. Unfortunately I can not do that. - What? The fact is, Alba can not to cope with another scandal. Alba needs a heartwarming show. - But without me. You will make a nice speech on your Hold machine ... and receive the basketball. Nobody will ever know about it. Looks like you can get away with it. Congratulation. But you can not do that with him ... I i... - season ticket, Invitation to the player skat and you get the next ball. Stop thinking, Fred! That's a good lie. The truth would be Denise hurt even more. I thought we have a deal? - Right, and you betrayed me. Huh? (Paris, "Freedom") N / A! (clears throat) Nervous? Well, just be yourself! As you have been all the time. (thunderous applause) - Fred! Lets go! (James Brown, "Get Up") Hu! You cut me out. - I am sorry. Benno has re-edited the film. - He has what?

Sit down, you asshole! What ... what is he doing? Is that a miracle? A wonder! He can run! He goes! Applause! Applause! He can... This is not a wonder. I am not disabled. I just pretended to get that ball I also do not want to ask for forgiveness. I know that I did not deserve it. What I did, that was ... that was pretty shitty. And I want to be with all people, I have hurt, apologize for it. Denise, are you listening to me? Denise, I'm sorry. And I love you. Denise! Denise! Denise! Denise! (Timid Tiger, "Miss Murray") Denise! Denise! De ... Mara! - Where is my ball? Where is he? - Where is my ball? You will not get a ball, because you're a punk! Take it back! - No!

You were in a coma for almost 2 years. Oh no. (Denise) Yes. No. That's what I was waiting for and pray that you wake up again. Yes, you deserve that. So you know how I felt. This is my cousin Paul. Hi, Paul. I'm feeling better, since I know you. Hmm. And I do not care whether you are in a wheelchair or not. Because ... yes, because ... (sighs) because I love you. Now I can talk to you and Now I do not know what to say. Then kiss her, man! Hmm. May I? Mr. Kimmel, it looks like - Hm? Are you ... You will never be able to walk again. - (sighs) Tell me something new!
