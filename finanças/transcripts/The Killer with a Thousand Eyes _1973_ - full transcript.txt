Who told do about this dog? Oh dog. You asked you a question. I don't know. You expect me to believe that. How did you get here? Where did this go? What happened to it? How am I supposed to know that I knew what was going on. I knew make it different. They wouldn't. I just started talking. You would tell me where the stuff is. I wanted him alive. What the hell do you shoot him, Paul? It's not important. They wouldn't have talked to anyway. Oh, he says so I'm going to force him to, you should be satisfied. Lawrence. You did more than all of us. Don't think we don't appreciate it. Only one thing didn't work out right. Costa was supposed to have killed him, but that's okay. Your boys had been in this all along. Costa never received that shipment because you beat him to it. Well, that's what I tried to tell you. There was a rival. Okay. You brushed it. I wonder. We could never get any way down here. There was close to $3 million at stake. Don't you think that's a worthwhile risk to take? Sally was you killed Mackenzie because he found out about you to let him live with or been too dangerous. So it must've been Sarah who kept you informed of every move. Custom-made. Cause I ever had you bumped her off because she thought I was going to get it to tall pity. I was rather fond of Sarah. One thing I don't understand is why was Dubai DAA killed? Oh, you started getting a little bit too greedy. He wanted to cut me out with Sarah. You might have to. You see, I just couldn't have that. I'm sure he knew the risk he was taking. That's the way it goes. And when he lent me his flat, he knew down well that was going to be a shooting. The hit me up for it, but it wasn't his idea. The idea was mine. He was just the one to carry it out. I was meant to get shot that night. But Donna's wife, she got it instead. Yes, but that was a very useful mistake. You see, there's no telling what a woman will do. She might've messed things up, couldn't let her live. Oh sure. Her husband wanted to spill the beans and that's why he got killed. Darnell was a coward. He was the only one. If you don't have any contents, but do you want to stupid. Do you understand that? Kill me and all your lousy life together aren't worth half a dollar. You really think so. We'll make an ounce of difference. Lawrence, make sure he doesn't try anything. Let's move on board. Well boys, it looks, if we're all going to be in the same boat and I mean I more wasted one now I kind of think of it cause your friend Albert knows very well what he has to do to YouTube. You get rid of both of you and keep the good for himself. I'll bet it's so well, isn't this the only one who knows what it is? Don't listen to it. You know what he's trying to do? Everyone gets his share as we agreed. Well, I show Albert, but I just wanted to make one thing clear between us. No double cross States. Don't you understand? He's just trying to save his own skin. And why did you kill Jacobs? [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] is this the place? Yeah, show me [inaudible] this is where it is. You sure you know what you're doing, Lawrence? Bring out the stuff and save your breath. Come on, Albert police. Hello? Arrive any second. Don't worry. You mean you don't want them to find this? Lawrence, I thought you were old on this. Joe. [inaudible] come on. You're getting inpatient too. Huh? I've been waiting for this moment. Even split okay with you. I'm just not going to be enough for me. Okay. What do you want? 60 40 I'm looking for peace of mind. Different by all the peace of mind you one.
