(light string music) (explosion booming) (program beeping) (fire roaring) (program beeping) (explosion booming) Access denied. Access denied. (explosion booming) Access denied. Access denied. Access granted. (virtual figure screaming) (explosion booming) (gavel bangs) You can't take the chyron chip away from me. It's my idea, my design, my patent. Dr. Trace, you have to defend your patent for the chyron chip. The investors have financed the development of the chip. By law, if they can't be repaid, the patent belongs to them. You can't give it to them. They will pollute the vision of everything my chyron chip stands for. (dramatic music) (men shouting indistinctly) (glass shattering) We got a live one over here. Get the gurney. Pull gurney up. We have to repair this shattered maxillary fracture. But we're gonna lose him if we don't get this damn artery clamped off. We're losing vital signs. Get me RD 40. Heart stopped. We need the defibrillator. Clear! One, two, three! (helicopter blades whirring) Hey. Patient is a male, late 20s. Multiple amputee, smoke lesions on the lungs, and third-degree burns over 80% of his body. Transfer from county? Mm-hmm. They amputated both of his legs and reconstructed his face. Well, what's the verdict? It's hard to tell. There's so many different pathways for the interface. Only one way to find out. Hello, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater. What does that mean? It means he can hear us. What is your name? What your is name? Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater. Maybe his name's Peter. (sighs) I'll try this. Had a wife, but couldn't keep her. Couldn't keep her. (Laughs) Had a wife, but couldn't keep her. Jobe. Hello, Jobe. (soft mysterious music) Jobe. Tell me about yourself. Empty space. It's all just empty space inside. Like it's been erased. I want you to try and visualize all the people and places that you've had contact with in your life. Just relax and let the images come to you. (computer beeping) Jobe. Hey, Jobe! Hi, Peter. Look what I got. Is that the new "Cosmic Man"? Yeah. It's great. Wow. Thanks, buddy. You're welcome. Happy birthday, Jobe. Make a wish. (Peter laughs) Excuse me, Jobe. I'm Jonathan Walker. I run this place. I now own the patent to the chyron chip, and you can build the chip for me. (Jobe breathing rapidly) (Jobe whimpering) Jobe, there's nothing to be afraid of. Virtual reality will rehabilitate your mind and eventually your body. You'll be all right. I promise. Just concentrate, okay? We'll try some music. (machinery beeping) (classical string music) (sparks crackling) Warning. Input exceeds maximum. Warning. Input exceeds maximum. (explosion booming) Warning. Input exceeds maximum. (siren blaring) Access granted. (program sizzling) (bright orchestral music) Hey, Matt! Matt! Come here. Have you seen Peter? No. Sorry. Hey, Jonathan! (pedestrians chattering) Service has been temporarily interrupted on metro five. (engines humming) (siren wailing faintly) (light string music) Get down on your knees and repent! Man destroys man! Save yourself before the end! Save yourself before the end! Get down and pray for forgiveness before the fire and the destruction! (buttons beeping) Thank you. Your videophone access code is approved. Hi, darling! Hi. (bright string music) Yeah! (Jade laughs) Oh, that was awesome. Here. Let me see. Cool. Here. (sparks sizzle) (man screams) Travis! Crap. (Laughs) Man, are you okay? Man, are you crazy, Peter? You know you can't hurt me. What's up, Sis? How long, Travis? Right now. Did you get it? Ask Peter. Just shoulder surfed it on the way over. Oh my god, you're a saint! Thank you. Come on. Let's go inside. Let's do it. I've got us patched into the fiber optics. You've got the access code. Man, we're set. What's up, Shawn? Hey. What's up, Travis? (dog barks) How about a taste of remote presence, my friends? All hooked up and ready to go. All right! Hey, let's use the cybercycles disk. No way, man. I'm flying. I am flying, man. Hey, me, too. I've been waiting for this all day. (machinery beeping) Please enter videophone access code. Trap-door access to cyberspace granted. Yeah! Please stand by for entry. All right! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Trap door open. Enter now. (machinery buzzing) (intermingling voices warbling) (exciting orchestral music) Yeah! Whoo! (explosion booms) Hey, Peter, what's happening? What's going on? (dog barking) Whoa! (kids screaming) (kids grunting) What's going on? (artillery booming) What happened? Who's doing this? (dog barking) Shawn, the cybercycles. Yeah. Harvey! Harvey, put in the cybercycle disk. Harvey, can you hear me? Put in the cybercycle disk now! (computer beeping) No one jacks out till we find who's doing this. (intense music) (blast booming) (man groans) (soft tense music) Jobe? You're alive. How can that be? There isn't time, Peter. I need your help. I'm dying. What do you mean, dying? The cyberscape is dying, and so am I, right along with it. I'm trapped here, Peter. You've got to help me. I don't get it. I need you to find someone for me, Benjamin Trace. What? Dr. Benjamin Trace. He's in seclusion somewhere. You've got to bring him, Peter. When the cyberscape dies, so do I. What if he won't jack in? Tell him I'm building his chyron chip, and I need to know about the Egypt link to complete it. No! Ah! Peter! Peter! Um, I don't think he's breathing. What do we do? Um, let's try CPR. Hurry up! We're running out of time. All right! One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one thousand, five one thousand. Breathe! Breathe, Peter. Breathe. One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one thousand, five one thousand. Breathe! It's not working! All right, one more time. Come on, Peter. Breathe. No! One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one thousand. (Peter coughing) All right. Come on. Get up. You okay? If you knew you were in danger, you should have jacked out, you jerk! That was the most remarkable example of telepresence I've ever experienced. (tense music) All personnel, clear the floor. VIP arriving. All personnel, clear the floor. VIP arriving. All personnel, clear the floor. VIP arriving. I want to talk to Halloway person to person. I don't want any other nonsense around at the time. Well, Senator Greenspan. How wonderful to see you again. Welcome to the Virtual Light Institute. Thank you. I'd like to introduce you to my head of research and development, Dr. Cori Platt. Oh, right. Nice to see you, Senator. Nice to meet you. And this is Jennifer. Please come with me, Senator. Senator. Virtual Light. Until now, no one has had the ability to create an entire computer network based within virtual reality. Of course, when I complete my Virtual Light uplink, I'll render all other systems obsolete. Virtual reality has evolved from a simulation to an actual place. Watch your head. Those monitors will kill you. So, it's like a whole new world out there. Uh-huh, full of interesting possibilities. Exactly. We- I love a man that does his homework, don't you, Doctor? But, Senator, what's holding us back is final congressional approval of our license. Ah, and this. [Senator Greenspan] Ah, yes, this must be the famous chyron chip that everybody's talking about. The key to my Virtual Light uplink. Hmm. (mysterious music) Since the information superhighway has left people feeling isolated from their fellow man, the Virtual Light Institute will bring cultures and resources together in one continuous virtual environment. And this is our main control room, hub of all our operations here at Virtual Light. I'm still a little unclear as to how all this fits together. Well, I'm sure Dr. Platt will enlighten you. Jennifer, please. (buttons beeping) The outer circle represents the real world. The inner one, virtual reality. The spokes are the different pathways between the two. The chyron chip will open up these pathways simultaneously, so a network based inside VR can be accessed by everyone. Uh-huh. So, next miracle. Please. Jennifer. When you hook into the library of my virtual city, you'll hook into every library in the world. And ultimately, the chip will bring everything online for everyone. Well, yes, it's very pretty, Jonathan, but I think we'd be placing quite a concentration of power in your lap. Hmm. My lap is your lap, Senator. Twinkie? How'd it go? Walker makes me feel like the star poodle in his dog show. At least you get top billing. No. Walker always gets top billing. Of course he didn't mention the fact that it's you completing the chyron chip and designing the virtual city. I don't mind. I care how other people see you, how they perceive you. That's your world, Dr. Platt, not mine. My world is in here. Out there, people look at me, and they see half a person. But in here, they see what I want them to see. How I really am. (soft instrumental music) Here. I don't see half a person, Jobe. That's your world. Good night, Jobe. (engine humming) (knocking on door) (pounding on door) What do you want? You sure don't look like the father of virtual reality to me. What? You're Dr. Benjamin Trace, right? He's dead. Dead? That's not what they said in the internet. The internet, they said he was, like, living here. The Benjamin Trace you want is resting in peace, so I suggest you get on that cool bike of yours and go on home. I don't know what Jobe was thinking. He's just crazy. Trippy fool invented some kind of chyron chip. What did you say? Chyron chip. Come inside. So what's your name, kid? Peter, Doc. (laughs) Call me Trace. Trace. Well, Peter, you know, it's all here, all the answers. In the earth, in the water, and in the air. Yeah. The reason I came is because my friend Jobe is dying. He said that you're the only one that could save him. You seem a bit young to know anything about the chyron chip. Well, Jobe told me about it. Who's Jobe? He was a lawnmower man back when my mom was still alive. He was my best friend, but now he's stuck in virtual reality. What's he know about it? He's building it. He's building it? Yeah. That's what he said. So are you gonna help or what? I don't live that life anymore, Peter. All that technology, it just consumes the soul. Check this out. I need your help. You can find me at the Third Street station, tunnel 11, if you ever change your mind. (gentle instrumental music) (computer beeping) (computer warbling) (explosion booming) Dr. Benjamin Trace. Only he can stop this. What if he won't jack in? Tell him I'm building his chyron chip. (dramatic music) (thunder cracking) Attention passengers, all metro blue line trains have been canceled due to flooding. (pedestrians shouting) Hustle, you guys. They want us out of here. Hey, come inside! (engines humming) (pedestrians shouting) My dog does not stink. Yes, he does, Shawn. The funk is burning my eyes. He does not stink! I looked at him and I almost went blind. It does not! We all know Harv used to be a poodle. He looks like a chihuahua on steroids! (pounding on door) Who is it? Peter? Trace? Hi. You know this guy, Peter? Back off, guys. This is the guy Jobe told me about, all right? You all live down here? Oh, no. This is just our summer cottage. I love your ventilation system. Listen, I think this guy can help us, okay? Adults have betrayed me my whole life. You know that, Peter. Yeah. Hey, hey, hey! Look, Travis. You don't have to trust him. You just got to trust Peter. Yeah! So you're the Einstein of VR? I'll take that as a compliment, Travis. You know, Einstein made a few mistakes himself. What are these? Man, you must really be a dinosaur. See the electroplates on the sides? They hit your temple and tap into certain neurons, giving you full neurosensory involvement. You can actually feel? Exactly. See, that's why we gotta save Jobe, though, "cause it's real in there. If he dies in there, he's gonna die out here. You sure Jobe needs saving? What are you trying to say? Jobe wouldn't lie to me. He's not that type of person. You said you couldn't trust any adult. He's not like you. I mean, he's like a kid. At least he was until... Until what? Until my next-door neighbor did some experiments with him in VR and turned him from a simpleton into a genius. Look, we're wasting time. You can ask him yourself in VR. Ready? Yeah. Let's hook it up. Let's do it. Okay. Doc, here's your stuff. Oh, I don't want to go into VR. Why not? I'm not ready. I don't know. Scared I might get lost or something. Fine. I'll go in. Okay. (computer humming) Trap-door access to cyberspace granted. Please stand by for entry. (VR program blasting) (Jobe cawing) Welcome to my world, Peter. Did you bring the good doctor? No. He's watching. He won't jack in. Jack in, jack off. What's the difference? Scared of the boogeyman, Doctor? You can at least humor me with a point of view, can't ya? It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Doctor. I feel like we're almost, I'm blushing, family. (laughs) I don't think so, Jobe. Don't be so sure. Incest, the game the whole family can play! "My brother's my daddy!" (kids snickering) We have a lot in common, Dr. Trace. We're both unwanted, underappreciated, and ahead of our time. The difference is, your time was then. My time is now. It's a short ride, Jobe. Enjoy it while you can. Oh, I plan to enjoy it for a very long time, Doctor. You see, I found the secret to immortality in the chyron chip. Where is the chyron chip? Come with me now, won't you? (electricity crackling) There she is! Miss chyron chip! It's taken years of work, but our chyron chip is finally a reality. (Jobe humming "Jaws" theme song) Look what I'm doing, Doctor. Isn't it amazing? You don't look like you're in danger. What do you want? Egypt. (laughs) Come on, don't hold back on me. It's a hidden nano-routine encoded into the design of the chyron chip. I'm not going to help you. Tell you what, you share Egypt with me, and I'll share with you technological knowledge beyond your wildest dreams. Think of this as your world, too, Doctor. Your work helped create it. My work is to build it. Now tell me, Doctor, what does Egypt mean? I'm not going to tell you. You're insane. You don't understand its power, Jobe. Oh, but I do, Doctor. In three days, I'll be in every system in the world. No. Tell me what Egypt means, Doctor, before I get really fucking pissed off! Get out of there, Peter. Peter, get out of there! Get him out! Peter! Get out! This is getting out of control! I don't know what's wrong. I've never seen Jobe like that before! (dramatic music) (machinery beeping) West Covina local departing platform B, level C. For customer service or cashier, follow the blue line to passage 9, level 4. San Fernando express now arriving, platform D. Hey! Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Ho, ho! No, no! (intense music) Shh. Shh! I thought you said that trains didn't run through these tunnels. They don't! (computer beeping) Oh, my god. It's heading right for us! Emergency procedures at once! Get out of here. But this is our home! Get out of here! Get out of here! Go! Dispatch, do something! Implement emergency procedures immediately! Implement emergency procedures immediately! Dispatch, shut all systems down! Come on! Come on, come on! Jade, Peter, hurry up! Run! Go, Travis! Go! (computer beeping) (computer buzzing) The game is afoot. (tense music) Close left. Code red! The caboose is loose. Please, god! Unauthorized access going forward. (train rumbling) Come on, let's go! Go! (train crashing) (driver screaming) (explosion booming) (dramatic music) (all screaming) Go! Run, run! Run! Go! Peter! Peter! This way! Harvey, come back! There's an exit at the end! Forget about that dog, Shawn! Come on up! Yes! All right, it's open! (explosion booming) (man screaming) Shawn, let's go! Come on! Shawn, let's go! I can't get up! I can't leave Harvey here. Come on, Shawn! (fire blast rumbling) (Shawn grunting) Come on, Trace, pull! Get out of there! (fire blast booming) Good boy. Let's get out of here! It's gonna blow! (people scream) (Trace screams) (blast booms) (solemn music) Man. (Exhales forcefully) Level five technician to robotics, division two. Chandara to quality control. (eerie music) Now let's deal with the true believers. Show me all the contributors to fundamental world religions over the past five years. Each user thinks that they have total privacy. Every time anyone logs on to Virtual Light uplink, we'll know every goddamn thing about them. Now show me all hypocritical democrats making over $300,000 a year. (computer beeping) That train was no accident, was it? Not a chance. Man, now we've lost our home and the cyberscape. Jobe did it so he could build his city. Like this world didn't suck enough already. I think that's just a taste of what he can do if he goes online. It can't get any worse. I mean, what's with this Egypt thing, Doc? Doesn't he need that from you? If Jobe's worried about Egypt, it means he's about to use that chip to its full hideous potential. Which is? Enter every and any system in the world and take over through VR. So is there any way to stop him, or should we just start digging up our own graves? We've got to get the chyron chip from him before he figures out Egypt. That's what we've got to do. Federal library? If we can use their computers to track down Jobe, we'll find the chip. That's right, Peter. You are illegally parked. Let's go. Jade? Initiate image regeneration. You've got to help me. Isn't that just like a recording? No. We've got to strip away the layers within the program to discover who the software that Jobe used to enter VR was licensed to. We've got a problem. I can't get past the memory lock to isolate the chain. Simple. Just enhance the memory index. What have we got here? Actualize data. Point five. Here we go. Execute worm function. Get 'em. Enhance. Redimensionalize variables. Ta-da! (Jade gasps) All we have to do now is access Datatronic systems. I'm right with you, Doc. Okay. There's our registered owner. Platt. I'm accessing phone listings now. Okay, we've got 43 Platts. See if you've got a Cori Platt. C-O-R-I. No Cori, but we've got three C. Platts. One's a PhD. Bring up the doctor. (gentle string music) Whoa! She... Hey, Trace, pull over. Aren't we going to Dr. Platt's apartment? Yeah, but first we gotta get a tracker so she can lead us to the chip. It's locked. So, how are they gonna do this? No problem. My brother can handle it. Really? He's great at this kinda stuff. (glass shattering) (alarm blaring) It's unlocked. Let's go shopping! Unauthorized contact. Stand back from the gate. (eerie music) Well, the extra day I got Greenspan to stay was useless. That liberal idiot is on his way back to Washington right now to recommend that they rescind our license to go online. If we lose that license, we're dead.

(tense music) (computer beeps) Open top-secret files. Request data transcripts. Jobe, Virtual Light. (computer clacking) You're awfully nosy, aren't you, Guillermo? (Guillermo screams) Cori. Trace. Hi. You haven't forgotten me? Not for lack of trying. How have you been? Fine, Ben. What do you want? I need to talk to you. About Jobe. He's not what you think he is. Neither were you. He's very dangerous, Cori. Hardly. And what makes you think you can just show up here and entertain a conversation with me? Please. I know you're angry. You have every right to be angry. I'm not angry. I'm leaving. Cori. What? Let's go. You look terrific. More beautiful than I remember. Okay, has Jobe used up all the memory in your system? Every printed word, thought, and deed in human history couldn't begin to fill the type of memory we're using. Because of my chyron chip. I heard you deserted that project, just like you did us. I'm sorry you lost the patent. I don't want pity, Cori. I want the chip. And you want me to help you get it. Forget it! You should know what Jobe is up to. Don't patronize me, Trace. I'm not your student anymore. He tried to kill me, Cori. You mustn't let him go online. Check his data file! You'll be surprised at what you find there. Hey, how are we doing? Cool. The tracker's working. (suspenseful music) That's where we have to break into to get the chip? Got any ideas? We could have Jade tap into county engineering and pull up the blueprints on that place. That's a good idea. You're cleverer than you look. Thanks. Where's David? I don't know. He was just here. Ma'am. David? Yes, ma"am? Take that down to the mail room. Right away. Arthur, it looks like you've been going at it for hours. Walker's orders. You don't do anything on this project without my authorization. Tell me what's going on. Can I speak with you for a moment? What? I do take my responsibilities just as seriously as you do, you know. You do your job, and let me do mine. What exactly is your job? Cori, we got a problem. What? All available memory capacity on the 1-1086S? Gone. That's impossible. I know that. (eerie music) What is going on? I didn't authorize this equipment. Jobe, what happened to the memory? I forget. Walker's behind schedule. We're not behind schedule. He's losing money, and he wants Jobe working nonstop on the Virtual Light. I'm not gonna discuss this with you. He's going online tomorrow. Oh, really? Mr. Walker. Mr. Walker! Mr. Walker! I think you've made a mistake, Doctor. No, I think you've made a mistake. Why wasn't I notified that you intend to put Jobe online tomorrow? Well, you're just a scientist. I'm the businessman. And Jobe is a human being. Jobe is a part of this project, a supremely important part. And every day that Virtual Light goes unfinished is costing me millions in potential revenue. He's showing signs of instabilities. I'm worried about him. (laughs) Well, the man is at a distinct disadvantage. You have been profiting off this man's misery for years. How many times have you postponed his prosthetic legs? Well, I couldn't have him literally getting up and walking out on us, now could I? Why don't we discuss this after Jobe goes online tomorrow? Okay? (suspenseful music) Request file, Jobe. Access denied, code 7. Override code 7.3942. (computer beeping) Access granted. Please wait. File 248 Jobe. Empty. Contents erased. Whose authorization? Jonathan Walker. Corporal, have you finished your security sweep of this floor? Yes, sir, I have. Dr. Platt. Henry. You startled me. Just making my rounds. Is everything okay? Fine, fine. I was just dropping off some production charts for the week. Good night, Henry. Good night. (tense music) (brakes screech) Oh, god! Ow! Oh my god! Are you all right? Did I hurt you? Oh, yeah. We're okay, ma'am. We'll be just fine. Whoa, wait, wait! Let me... Me again. (Cori gasps) I was right, wasn't I? Jobe's expanding his memory base. Get out of the car. Cori. (intercom beeping) Ah, good. I caught you. A guard reported seeing you in my office this evening. Surely you could have come up with a better excuse than production charts. No, no, no. Jobe is going online tomorrow. So I wanted to deliver them to you myself. I see. Well. Good. Be sure to get some rest. We've got a big day tomorrow. You're working for Jonathan Walker? He's the one that stole my patent? He didn't exactly steal it. He was one of the investors that took me to court. Get out of the car. I was right about the memory base. I'm right about Jobe. I don't think you and Walker understand the power you're dealing with. Get out. I thought you were better than this, Cori. (tense music) You stole a gun? No, man. It's a camera. Check it out. Cool. All right. Let's do it. (suspenseful music) (guards chattering) Execute virtual surveillance system loop. Your attention, please. A coolant test will be run on levels 8 through 10 at 0300 hours. Thank you. Yes! Lieutenant Martin to security. Lieutenant Martin to security. Sublevel 4. They have to understand that those tubes have to be heli-arced about three inches wide. Guess they don't realize that the aluminum tubing is about eight millimeters thick. That's a special laser alarm, sensitive to anything above zero degrees centigrade. Come. I've got an idea. Yeah. It's Dr. Platt. I seem to have left my key card in the lab. Oh, yes, Doctor. I'm sorry. We didn't know it was you. Thank you. (hydraulic door hissing) (laser humming faintly) You ready? I don't think so. This isn't one of your best ideas. I wouldn't trust anybody else. You can do it. Stay steady now. Go on. Steady. (tense music) Grab it. Grab it! (alarm blaring) (dramatic music) (guards shouting) (Jobe laughing maniacally) (glass shattering) (Jobe laughing) (Trace groans) (alarm blaring) Trace! What are you doing? He'll kill them! Henry! What the hell is going on? By the way, who are you? (dramatic music) (guards shouting) (gunfire blasting) Stop! Clear! Trace! Halt! Sealing lock, sector 4. Sector 4 secured. Want the chip? Put your guns down. Put them down, or I'll smash it. Put 'em down now! Slide 'em forward. Peter! Catch! Trace! (men grunting) I got you! (guard grunting) (gun booming) Trace! Peter! Trace! (Trace yells) (both grunting) (Trace groans) Get out of here. Get! (alarm blaring) (both grunting) (sparks crackling) Trace? Trace! Come on! You have the card? What now? Here. Where? Go on. Go. Where? Go! Oh! Go! Whoa! Yeah! (all screaming) Why did I let you back into my life? You find me irresistible. You got the chip? Good work. You're bleeding. Let's get out of here. (guards chattering) All right. Yes, sir. What is that? It's nothing. Just some dirt. Bring it to me. Get that dirt, you idiots! Yes, sir. Take off your shirt. What do you have in mind? Shut up. I need to stop this bleeding, and I'll be damned if I use my shirt to do it. Do I know you guys? Ow. Ow. I know I owe you an apology, Cori. (chuckles) You could say that. Do you mind? Oh, not at all. No, no. Pretend we're not here. Yeah. Okay. So apologize. I'm sorry, Cori. I really am. I didn't want to see anybody. I was too ambitious. I was naive. I was- You're stupid. That, too. (tender music) Thanks for the medical attention. You're welcome for the medical attention. (Peter laughs) (birds twittering) Hey, race to the top of the hill. Not me. I wonder if there are any snakes over here. (chip tinkling) Pretty neat, huh? It's incredible. See how they were able to bypass the capability protection registers? I know. It's amazing. It makes me wonder if I could have ever finished it myself. The chip was supposed to make things better for them, wasn't it? Ironic. Still, maybe it could. What did he do here? That's where Jobe merged the nano-matching hardware. He couldn't have. There's no transmatrix. Yes, there is. There isn't. (computer beeping) Something's wrong. It should be there. So you lost the chip. You idiot. Do you honestly think I'd entrust something that important to you? Voila. But... People want a show. Now that Jobe has solved the Egypt link, the chip can be activated. Now get out of my sight. Any progress? Jobe is tracking down the intruders by analyzing the dirt sample we found. Good. And you are ingenious. Yes. I know. I think it's time we called the president. Try to get Virtual Light Europe. Where? Anywhere. Uplink, England, Virtual Light. (tense music) (computer beeping) Nothing. Greetings, Mr. President. Walker. Thank you for joining us on this momentous occasion. I'm happy to be here. I was shocked to hear about Senator Greenspan's dreadful accident. Yes. I know how much he wanted to be a part of what we're doing here today. But la vie continue. We'll be joined by hundreds of other prominent people who'll be jacking in from all over the country, so if you're ready, don your eyephones, and we can begin. (suspenseful music) I'm... just relax. (VR program blasting) (crowd cheering) Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Virtual Light. We stand in the face of a new age. The future is one world, one thought, one mind. Behold. The future is now. (crowd cheering) (electricity crackling) (crowd applauding) 12 hours to global interface. (dramatic music) (speaking Japanese) (speaking foreign language) (speaking German) It's all taken care of. The foreign marketplace will be secure only when they place their money in your hands. Excellent work, Jobe. It's already started to happen. What's that supposed to mean? It means that Jobe must have figured a way around Egypt. And he's using the chip to enter every system and program around the world, replacing it with himself. It takes about 12 hours for the interface to complete. Once complete, it's irreversible. Walker's gonna stop him. Are you crazy? Who do you think is doing this with him? Walker's a businessman, and Jobe is bad for business. Come on. Well! What a surprise. I didn't expect to hear from you so soon, Doctor. You've gotta stop Jobe before it's too late. Too late? What happened to your sense of loyalty, Cori? You wouldn't know the meaning of the word, Walker. Is that Dr. Benjamin Trace? Listen, Walker, you've got to take Jobe offline immediately. (chuckles) Well, you see, Doctor, I would love to accommodate you, I really would, but that's not an option I can exercise right now. Listen to me, you stupid bastard! If you do not take him offline, you will have no options! No one will! Are you threatening me, Doctor? No, I'm not. Jobe is. Jobe is a loyal employee of this company. I trust him with my life. Well, you'd better, because you just gave it to him. Time to get rid of some pesky little roaches. Stop. Back two sectors. Enhance. They check in, but they didn't check out. System override. (tense music) No response, control. I need help, here. Mayday! (equipment beeping) (pilot talking faintly) Hey, Doc, we got company. Reference present position. You gotta help me here! Override the system! Roger. Referencing present position bruno. Do have bruno. We are losing altitude, control. Let's get out of here. Harvey! Harvey! Leave the damn dog! Go to frequency one. Help me here! Help me! Help me! (Screams) (explosion booms) (dramatic music) (VR program blasting) Two hours to global interface. Give me access to all credit accounts. Sorry. Your account is overdrawn. Huh? This card is no longer valid. No! No! ATM machines. (people clamoring) Department of Water and Power. Reports of city-wide civil disturbances have been verified as the police department has gone on full tactical alert. With automated system failures occurring throughout the city, response is expected to be slower than usual. Already the violence has taken several lives, and few see an end to the continuing chaos. Officials are reporting a remarkable outbreak of looting and random mayhem throughout the city, nation, and globe. Jobe. He's finished this city. That's why he waited, so he could offer an alternative. People need hope. If he can destroy our world, he figures we'll have to turn to him as the new messiah in cyberspace. But you can't live in cyberspace. Jobe can. If he can achieve global interface, we won't have any choice. Egypt. Where they built the first dam. The chip is a dam. Exactly. (people clamoring) (solemn music) Come to me, all who have burdens. I will set you free, and you will no longer be the bastard children of a lost generation. (frantic music) It's time to take control of the system! There shall be no more authority to oppress you. We can all be the authority. (glass shattering) Jack into the New World Order. Follow Jobe. Follow Jobe. Escape the violence and greed that threaten to consume you! 30 minutes to global interface. Come be one with your fellow man. This is true spirituality. (people shouting) (glass shattering) There shall be no more authority to oppress you. World economic markets have taken some of the worst collapses in history. Jonathan, I have some bad news, and I have some bad news. The core of a reactor in Kazakhstan went into a meltdown in the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl. Attention, please. All data highways. Where are you going? Where do you think you're going? Come back here! What are you doing? Stay here. You can't go anywhere! Come on. Jobe. What the hell is going on? We've lost control of the entire system. All the laboratory files are disappearing. Are you messing with me? Now answer me. That's an order. (laughs) You have no power to give orders. In a hundred years, your petty financial empire won't mean anything, but I'll still be here. You son of a bitch. Without me, you're nothing but a deaf and dumb cripple. I made you, and I can unmake you. Jonathan. 20 minutes to global interface. (suspenseful music) You can't disconnect him because virtual Jobe will remain inside. So it looks like you have two options. You can either heavily sedate him, or you can take him out. If you want to take me out, just ask. (lock engages) Open the door, goddamn it! Bastard! (Jobe chuckling) All right. If that's the way you want to play it. (Jobe laughs) Prime alert. (alarm blaring) Security breach. All personnel, prime alert. Security breach. All personnel. Code red. Code red. This is an emergency. All personnel will evacuate the building immediately. There are three terrorists on the premises, fully armed and dangerous, moving down corridor 16. Shoot on sight. Repeat. Shoot to kill. That son of a bitch. Wait, sir, you just said there were terrorists in the building! We're the terrorists, you idiot! Give me that gun. There are three terrorists on the premises. Shoot on sight. Repeat. Shoot to kill. Jonathan! No! (gunfire booming) 15 minutes to global interface. Give yourselves to me. Your rebirth in the womb of cyberspace is a chance for a new beginning, to live in Eden, without hunger, without famine, without temptation. 10 minutes to global interface. We have 10 minutes, Cori. You better watch the monitors and- And pull the real chip at the exact moment you destroy the virtual one. Trace. Check it out, man. Let's look. If we could just jack into that dome unnoticed. Won't work. Jobe will know everything about anyone who jacks in to the dome. We've gotta find another way in. All right, well these are the routes for the information superhighway that lead directly into the dome. You don't have to jack in, Doc. You have a problem with jacking into VR? No. I'll be fine. I'm not gonna run away this time. Okay. Listen up, you guys. We're gonna follow this superhighway through the city to where it goes underground all the way into the dome. We take this access route here, follow that up inside. Then comes the tricky bit. We've gotta get by Jobe, and smash the chip. How are we gonna get through the city? Well, how's about a little bike ride? Okay. Let's do it. Cool. Okay, Travis, you have- Destroying the chip won't stop Jobe. What do you really have in mind? The paradox of the chip is that whereas it gave Jobe the power to go online, it contains a dam function to prevent the use of absolute power. If we destroy the chip, we destroy the dam and expose Jobe. We've got to make him angry enough to destroy himself. Trace, come on, man! We gotta go! If you can't, get out. I don't want you disappearing on me again. (adventurous music) (engines rumbling) (fire whooshing) (explosion booms) The promised land. The time has finally come. You shall wait no more. The prophecy is already being fulfilled, for I have seen the heavens open and a voice from the throne say, "The rivers will run with blood! There will be chaos in the streets! And in the final days, the material world will fade away, and only cyberspace will remain.” In the womb of cyberspace is a chance for a new beginning, to live in Eden without hunger, without famine. With me, you will find refuge. Jobe! We came to save you, Jobe. In here, I am the savior. Trace! (tense music) (swords clank) (electricity crackles) (both grunting) I will crush you! 30 seconds to global interface. You're just a lawnmower man, Jobe. Lawnmower man is dead! (Trace screams) By the way, I don't have to worry about Egypt anymore. I simply built around it. 19. (Trace grunts) (swords clank) 14, 13, 12, 11, 10 seconds to global interface. You destroyed Peter's world. I'm going to destroy yours. Six, five, four, three, two, one. (explosion booms) (Jobe screaming) You're a fool, Trace. I don't need the chyron chip anymore. I've become the chip! You betrayed Peter, Jobe. You've sold your soul for nothing. You don't even have enough power to destroy me! (Trace screaming) Is that all you've got, Jobe? Is that all you've got? Is that the best you can do? (laser beam beeping) (Jobe grunting) What's happening to me? Egypt, Jobe. Egypt. (Jobe shrieking) (electricity crackling) (explosion booming) Hey, Jobe. Come here. Make a wish. Make a wish. (sparks sizzling) (grand orchestral music) Yeah! We're back! Yeah! Whoo! (all cheering) Wow. (Cori laughs) Sweetheart. Hey. Hey. My pal. Well done. Hey! I need to see Jobe. Okay. Let's go. We gotta definitely do this again. (sparks sizzle) There he is. Careful. Probable pathways to interface, 40,034. He's regressing. Jobe? Peter. Peter, pumpkin eater. (Laughs) (dramatic music) Well, isn't that touching? I want the chip. You can keep the rest, for what he's worth. We'll give you the chip. Give us the kid. I really dislike repeating myself. Give him the chip. Oh, by the way, Dr. Platt. You're fired. Peter! (gunfire booming) (Trace grunting) (Jonathan screaming) (electricity crackling) (soft instrumental music) I thought I lost you, man. Let's go home. (birds twittering) (adventurous music)
