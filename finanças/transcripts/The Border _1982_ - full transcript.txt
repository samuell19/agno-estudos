...en el nombre del Padre... y del Hijo... y del Espiritu Santo. - Mire! Que es eso? - Dios mio! Maria! Maria! I'll get us some burritos and Cokes while you pull a few. The unions are squeezin' me, threatenin' to burn this place down. I'm in a union. That's a whole other thing. I'm talkin' about the life and death of my operation... and half the factories in Los Angeles. They want a minimum wage. The day that I gotta start payin' these people two-fifty an hour, my business is a memory. Well, I gotta have a couple of 'em. Take any two you want. Be my guest. Who? Mendoza? You want 'im? Take 'im! But I gotta tell ya, he's got a lotta mouths to feed. All right, what about these two? You want 'em? Take 'em. Senores? Uno momento. Tiene ninos? Si, tengo dos. Dos? What about you? N â™ª. No tengo. No tengo. What about it, Lou? You gonna have jobs for these guys when they come back? Sure. These are good workers. Hey! Buen trabajadores, huh? When you come back, you got good jobs. Six bucks a day. Over here. Lean up against the wall there. You're under arrest by the authority... of the United States Bureau... Lou! Of Naturalization and Immigration. All right, I gotta go. You're doin' a good job. Okay. Come on. Let's take a walk. Hi, hon! Charlie, there is no time. Hi. There is no time for anything at all. I didn't even have time to wash my hair today. What do you do all day? Aha! Here it is. Look at that. Johnny. You're looking good tonight, Johnny. What is it? Well, look at it. Isn't that the prettiest duplex you ever did see? Where'd this come from? From El Paso. From my dear, darlin' friend Savannah. See the one marked in red? That's hers. She's made it possible for us to have the one next to it. Who's our first contestant tonight? What are you talkin' about? Buyin' a duplex? With what? Darlin', right now the price is right. The price is gonna skyrocket, and besides, it's everything we ever dreamed of. I never dreamed of livin' in El Paso. How hungry are you? Hungry-Man or normal? Hungry-Man. You got it. I was thinkin' about maybe goin' back in the... Recreation and Parks Service. You gotta think of goin' forward, not backward. Remember when we used to feed those ducks? Maybe the Forest Service. But, darlin', that's a dead end. I, uh, I liked feedin' those ducks. It's my woman's intuition that things could be better for us in El Paso. I just wanna talk about it. You've got six more seconds. We never talk about anything, Marcy. Did you ever realize that? We never fuckin' talk about anything. I am available to talk any time you would like. Es Norte America. Si. They're here! They're here now! Just look at it! It's just like the picture says. Charlie, I'm in paradise. I believe I'm gonna sprout wings and a halo! Marcy! Marcy! Oh-ho! I'm so glad to see you! I'm the welcome wagon! Look at you! Oh, we're here! Oh, we made it! I can't believe it! Oh, you look so good! This here's Charlie. Hi. Hi. Well, now, he's really cute. Thanks. And you're Cat! Real nice to meet you. You must be Timmy. Aren't you the darlin'est thing! How ya doin', Charlie? Fine. Doin' fine. Have a nice trip? Yeah. Nice to meet you. This is Timmy. Shake the man's hand, son. Timmy. Don't you wanna see what you bought yourself? Come on in. I turned the air conditioner on. Don't go havin' vapors, honey. You wait. It's blazin', huh? Cool today. Carry her. What? You have got to carry her. Oh... Sa... Savannah. Savannah, come on. The man's just driven a thousand miles. I've put on a little... Go on now. Cross the threshold. We've been married 11 years. Okay. I suppose it's never too late. Come on. I'll carry you in. Up you go. Oh! Atta boy! You got her. Don't bump me into the door! Oh. Oh! It's just... It's beautiful! It's just perfectly beautiful! Oh! It's so lovely. I don't believe it! And that's where we'll put the Nu-Vue. Nu-Vue just happens to be one of the top pool manufacturing companies. Oh, I could cry! Really. Mm. I think you're all gonna like it here. Oh-ho. Oh, I know we are. Dad, I wanna go swimming. Okay, Timmy, go ahead. Don't stay in too long now. You're not talking a whole bunch, Charlie. Yeah, well, I'm just takin' everything in. Thanks. Well, here's a great big kiss... for bringin' my little Marcy back home to Texas where she belongs. Isn't she as pretty as I said she'd be? She sure is. Well, I used to be somethin'. But now I drive past the high and all them little girls are wearin' my old tits. Hey, Marcy, do you still think we could knock them dead? I know we can. She ever tell you how we could ginger up a whole stadium? Let's show 'em, honey. A one and a two and a ba-ba-ba-ba. Eagles born and Eagles bred. When I die, I'll be in Eagles' heaven. Fight, you Eagles, knock 'em dead! 'Cause if we win, we'll give you head! I didn't say that. No way! I did not. Yes, you did. Charlie, I figure you and me have scored the best damn pussy in the whole state of Texas. Charlie, you ought to get the shirts tailored. They'll look a whole lot better. You think so? Well, it's a matter of preference. I get mine done that way. Well, uh, what's the cost to get the tailoring done? The shirts will cost you ten dollars each. We can narrow the pants for five. They got some really nice boots here. You oughtta look at a pair, Charlie. I better take it easy. $125 clothing allowance, you know. I wouldn't worry about that. Buster can bill you for it. Give you some time to get caught up. Right, Buster? That's right. Free for 30 days. No, I think I better take it just the way it comes off the rack. I can't tell you how glad I am to have you down here. Well, I want to thank you and your wife for all your help. Well, it's you that's helpin' me. I'm stuck with guys down here that are too dumb to roll rocks down a steep hill. No reason why you can't move real fast down here, Charlie. Real fast. Today your partner's a guy named Hawker. He's a real son of a bitch, but he knows what he's doin'. - Why'd you transfer out here? - Needed a change. My wife's from Dallas. How long's the fence? The Tortilla Curtain? You only have to go three miles to get around it. People just cut holes in it. Saves 'em a lot of time. You'll find there's a pretty good bunch of boys here. You'll find you can pretty much trust 'em... most of 'em. You know, it's funny what you can see in a man. Just... the way he wears his clothes. The uniform's supposed to make everyone the same. That's what the word means. Uniform. But if you... Venganse! Andale! Andale! Pronto! Pronto! Julio! Ven aca! Pronto! Pronto! Day workers mostly. Come over in the mornin', go back at night. No way to stop 'em; No point in really botherin'. You ever throw dirt clods as a kid? Well, it's the same damn game. This is a desert. There ain't a dirt clod to be found for miles. It doesn't really get rough 'til after dark. I get it. Coyote's the one in the lead. We usually let 'em get across. It's easier to pick 'em up on this side. See, if you surprise 'em in the river, they just hunker down in the water there and get pneumonia. I figure life is tough enough for 'em without makin' it worse. - You wanna watch us book 'em in? - Sure. Hurry up! Let's go! I brought my man Charlie here to see how you big boys work. Sanchez. Sanchez, why don't you start... goin' on back over to Nogales and crossin' there? Hell, we been drivin' you back so often, we'll have to start chargin' you bus fare. We got a call. We gotta go. Hold your ass. We don't usually get calls from up here. Just stay here. Okay. Hawker? Hawker! Hawker? Hawker! Station One? Station One? This is Charlie Smith. Get us some goddamn help! Where is he? I don't know. I didn't see him go down. He was right out here in front of the truck. You see him? You got him? Hawker? Hawker? Gimme some cover, Charlie. Okay, you ready? Yeah. You ready? Go! Ready. Go. He's fuckin' dead! They had it on the radio this morning. We heard it when we were comin' in. Bastards! You didn't really get any kind of a look at 'em, huh, Charlie? No, I didn't really. Well, F.B.I. will probably send some boys, poke around up there. If there's any kind of evidence, they'll find it. I figure he probably came on some dopers. Surprised them and... Tough break for you, Charlie, first time out. Fuckin' dopers! Andy! You tell them damn mechanics of ours, Andy, that the speedometer on my rig says 140 miles an hour, and it damn well better go 140 miles an hour the next time I want it to. Yes, sir. Red, this here's Charlie Smith. Sir. Oh. Hello there, Charlie. I been wantin' to meet you, welcome you to the unit. I'm real sorry it had to be under circumstances like this. Right face! Arms up! Ready, fire! Ready, fire! Ready, fire! Left face! Present arms! Buenas tardes. Su nina es bonita. Gracias. Hey! Hey! I'll break your goddamn cabeza in half! Sueltalos, te digo! Sueltalos! No quiero nada con un ladron! Vete de aqui. Sueltalos! Son de usted? Si. Gracias. Gracias, senora. Senora? Senora, espera. Save the last dance for me. You made me a whole man again. But now, Carla, I, I have something to tell you. Marcy? Isn't it beautiful? Goddamn! What did this fuckin' thing cost? Did you say something? I was askin' you how much this cost? We don't have to worry about paying for it... because I opened up a charge account at the Galleria. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Charlie, um... Am I gaining weight? Well, I suppose you are. You eat so goddamn much. Don't be funnin' me. I know you like the way I feel. Don't you wanna feel it? Feel it? Mm-hmm. Carla, I can't... Charlie, do you know somethin'? It stays real cold, real cold in the summer, and it can get real hot in the winter. I'm leaving on the QE II Tuesday. We'll go together. We'll go to another place. We can't. You've missed the point. Well. Captain Cook's Fish Fiesta. A heapin' bucket of giant jumbo shrimp, succulent chunks of fried fish, luscious bites of langostino. Mmm. I'd better cast off for. Captain Cook's Fish Fiesta right now. And remember, no fishy smell, no fishy taste. Shipshape clean, and the eating's great. Levantense ya. Todos en una linea. I got him. Okay. Okay. Ya no puedo! Dejame! Sientate. Momentito. Alto. - Easy, Cat, easy. - "Easy"? Ever see this before? Push this in grammar schools, Charlie. Ten-year-old kids gettin' hooked on this. Stick him in the box for me. Todas las mujeres y los ninos aqui. Los hombres por aca. Vengan. Senora? Si. Yo. Mis... Uh... Mis hubcaps. No, no, no. Por favor. No, no, no, no, no. Suelteme! Quit this. Suelteme, pendejo! Por favor. Por favor. Basta. I believe that woman kinda went for you! Goddamn, Beef. You think that's funny. That was a Mexican come-on! Quieres agua, hombre? No, no quiero agua. Okay. This here's my eye, Charlie. How ya doin'? He works with us on the other side. Manuel, Charlie. Como esta, Manuel? Aqui, no mas. They can use you over in the write-up room. Adios. Orale! You got any idea what they're gettin' for Wets delivered up north? Haven't got a clue. Five hundred and fifty bucks a head. Well, I guess we're sendin' them the wrong way, aren't we? Hell, Texas's been runnin' on Wet labor since before I was born. Does pretty damn good too. You think this country'd get by without Wets? You go out on some boilin' hot day... and pick your own lettuce and tomatoes and beans and onions. Jimbo, sounds like you're figurin' on turnin' in that uniform... and becomin' a coyote. Brush up on his Spanish and he'd make a damn good coyote. Hey, Charlie, how you spell illiterate? Only a gourd-head would ask a stupid question like that. Look it up in the dictionary. How're you supposed to look it up if you can't spell it? Como se llama, usted? Maria. Here ya go, Charlie. Got a live one for ya. Seems kinda silly, don't it? We're bustin' our asses to send 'em back, and respectable businesspeople payin' to bring 'em in. I guess out in L.A. it was pretty much the same. Pretty much, yeah. There sure as hell ain't no way to ever stop 'em, is there? Man of your experience must know that sometimes... it makes no sense to even try. Somebody shit in your beer? What are you fishin' for? You and me might have some of the same ideas about things, Charlie. I mean, we're neighbors. And... I'm tryin' to build somethin' for my family. And I know how hard you been working to build somethin' for yourself and Marcy. I'm onto somethin' good, partner, and I figured maybe I could bring you in. Yeah, well, you figured wrong, Cat. Hey. Okay. Any way you want it, partner. I mean, I'll fight ya, fuck ya, run ya a footrace. Whatever you want, Charlie. 'Cause I want us to be friends. Hi, hon. Hi. Charlie, I'm gonna show you. What? What is your opinion... Your honest opinion of TV? I think it sucks. No, Charlie. I mean for me. For me. I must be missing the point, Marcy. As a medium for my expression. Now, Savannah says that I have a certain style. What happened to your face? Are you trying to tell me that you want to be on television? Charlie, it is a seed. It is a little, tiny seed that is sprouting in my mind. I married a banana. I married a fuckin' banana. Charlie, I am serious. I have never been more serious in my life. I don't know how you would get a job like that. I don't even know how a person would get a job... It's just that... Oh! Charlie, my God! What are you doing? What the fuck is this, Marcy? It's our new swimming pool! Charlie, are you all right? Senora? Perdoname, senora. Hey, man, you want to go fuck some girls? No. - Pinche gringo! - Mamalon! Flat on my back, and in walks the cutest blue-eyed doctor you ever saw, and he asks me if I'm ready. All right, Savannah, that's enough. Honey, I'm just havin' a little fun, okay? It was years before we was married. Don't be inhibitin' me 'cause you know how pissed off I get! Then what happened? I said, "I have never in my life been more ready." You don't have to etherize me or nothin'!" Marcy. Charlie, where have you been? I gotta talk to Cat. What are you doing dressed like this, comin' to this nice party with all this nice stuff? Where's Cat? I don't know. But look at the way you're dressed. Charlie! I had this dream I was makin' these little bitty grunts comin' out... Charlie! Excuse me. Can I talk to you, Cat? My God, you are sweaty! What happened to you? Can I talk to you? I love sweaty men. Will you excuse me? Sure. You wicked girl! That kid is dead. What kid? The one we pulled last week. The kid with the dope on him. He's fuckin' dead. The one last week? I turned him over to Manuel. Well, somebody slit his goddamn throat. I left him on the other side with his Adam's apple all over his fuckin' chest. Jesus Christ. Well... The kid was a doper. They have their own way of dealin' with things. What you sayin'? Manuel did it? I don't know who killed him. I only know he's dead 'cause you're tellin' me. The Mexicans, they have their own kind of justice, same as we do. We all take care of our own. Dopers kill and they get killed all the time. Well, hello there, Charlie. Say, uh, you didn't have to dress up on my account. You better check his green card, Cat. I think he's come in wet. Red, uh... That... That doper we brought in last week... Charlie found him over on the other side. He's dead. I already called the Rangers. What're you doin' over there, Charlie? - I just went over there to look around. - Uh-huh. Well, maybe you don't know this, but, uh, I don't like my men goin' over there... not even for a Mexican meal. You get in trouble over there, and I'd have a hell of a time gettin' you out. Well, what the hell. Let's have some fun. â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª â™ª Happy birthday, dear Red â™ª â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª â™ª Happy birthday, dear Red â™ª â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª Get up! Let's go! Let's get together here! En linea, por favor. Come on. Move it! Move it! Move it on now! Ah, senores. Esto no es un tren de pasajeros. Bajense, por favor. Juan! I got him! I got him! Juan, esperate! No seas tonto! Charlie? Are you all right? Yeah. Juan, estas bien? Okay, Charlie? Man, you had me scared shitless. Absolutely scared shitless. Riskin' your life for that little fucker! Hiya, Charlie. Hey, Charlie. Chief wants to see ya. Hola. Como estas? Muy bien. Y usted? Bien. Es la muchacha? La que tiene un nino. Hey, Charlie. Oh, hi, Red. How ya doin'? Fine. Cat told me about the incident on the train. That was a fine piece of work. Oh, thanks. How 'bout a chew? Uh, no. Well, I chew at work. My wife don't like it around the house. Shoot? "Shoot"? Birds. No. In October, we got ducks sittin' in these levies down here thicker than flies on shit. Well, I haven't done much huntin' since I was a kid. Yeah, well, don't worry about it. I'll let you have my wide-pattern Browning. Can't miss. Won't embarrass you. Que bonito que es su nino! Pobrecito, tanto calor. No quiere ir a lavarse? Mire, yo se lo cuido nada mas un ratitito. Si me lo da a mi, yo se cuido lo muy bien. Luego va y se lava y yo se lo regreso. Quiere? Ande. Deme. Bu eno. Yo se lo cuido. Esta dormido. Si. Si, se lo cuido. Asi, andale. Yo se lo cuido, eh? Gracias. I'm sure I'm not gonna be tellin' you anything you don't know. The game's a little different around here. There's some real big money on the table. Smart man, he's gonna play his cards right tight up against his chest. Mi nino! Donde esta mi nino? Donde esta la senora que tenia mi nino? Donde esta su companera? Donde esta mi nino? Me han robado mi nino! Abran la puerta, por favor! Se robaron a mi hijo! Abran la puerta! Maria. What's goin' on back there? Abran la puerta! Of course, if some farmer throws a sack of onions in the back of your car, I don't mind you leavin' a few Wets in his field. But anything unusual comes up, by God, I better be the first to know about it. What's all that hollerin' about? What the hell's goin' on? Well, get 'em outta here! Get 'em on the buses! Get 'em out! Get 'em back to Mexico! I don't need no confrontation. Mi nino! Nice work, boys! Nice work! Thank you. Good job. Good job. You fellas who are hurt, you all get first aid. What happened out there? I'm not sure, sir. Where the hell's that baby? Listen, man. I'm telling you, it's okay. You stole a baby outta the goddamn compound. What the hell you mean, "it's okay"? This ain't the little baby Jesus, you know. It's just some indio. I don't go in for stealin' babies... Indiobabies or any other kind. I don't cotton to that kinda shit! Understand me? Don't worry, man. The kid is okay. An Anglo family. They paid big money for him. He's gonna have it real good. Big cars, swimming pools. We did a good thing for him. I just make a little money on the side. No big deal. I told you before. We're in the business of movin' Wets and nothin' else. You ever come across runnin' babies or dope... or any other goddamn thing, and... I'm gonna knock your fuckin' dick into the dirt. Okay. Okay. Don't worry, man. With me, you ain't got no problem. That's him. El Scorcho. The Burned Face. He's running Wets on our territory. Competition, amigo. This makes up the total order, ma'am. - Just tell the boys where to spot that sofa. - Okay. Be careful goin' through the door, you all. I think it'll look nice right over there. What about this thing and the breakfront? Oh. Well, I don't know. I think the... And the breakfront over there by the wall. Get it right in that corner there. Well, we'll just put it right in there. Um, yeah, I think... If there's anything else, ma'am, you just speak right up. You want the plastic on or off the sofa? I want it out. Oh. Oh, hi, honey. You're up. Um, I was, uh... I was gonna surprise you. Um, I think I'll take the plastic off myself, okay? Very well, ma'am. That's all. Sign here. Okay. Thank you. I think we should have the plastic made into permanent covers. They say you can extend the life of your combo by a couple of years if you... No more, Marcy. No more is no more. No more does not mean more and more and more. No more means no more. Don't you understand? I am doin' this for us, Charlie. All our goddamn money is left locked up in this goddamn house! By the time they take the mortgage payments out of my paycheck, there's not enough left to buy you a fuckin' box of tampons! I am doin' the best that I know how to make you a dream house. I want this for you. I can't afford a fuckin' dream house! But... But... I can't afford it. You got it? All you ever do is yell about money, money, money! Don't you care... Oh! I'm sorry. Charlie, do you know something? All I ever do is try to make you happy. I'm sorry. What's on your mind, Charlie? You still workin' on that deal? Mm-hmm. I just wanna say I'm open. That's all. I'm open. All right. I tried to sit you on the right horse from the start. Why'd you make it so rough? Don't matter, does it? No. Whatever your reasons are, I respect them. This here is the drop house. â™ª .â™ª.? Hey! Hey, â™ª.â™ª. Got a message from Manuel. You got a load comin' over? Who the hell's that? This here is Charlie Smith, â™ª.â™ª. Charlie's my partner now. Where ya from, boy? California. California! Shit, I used to work out there durin' the war in them shipyards. The whole time I was out there I never met anybody that was worth a pinch of shit. They're a bunch of scum-suckin' dogs. Come on. Lay off. I ain't kiddin' ya. I'd go down there and... hold my nose and put a double rubber on my dick... and fuck all those dockside whores down there. Likely as not, uh... ...I mighta knowed your mother, sonny. Just a teeny little push, that's all. Just a teeny little push. Guess we caught â™ª.â™ª. With a wild hair up his ass. Come on, Charlie. Wait outside. Wait outside while we talk. It's okay. Come on. All right. Okay. Fine. Put that fuckin' gun away. Where do you come off pullin' that kind of shit anyway? I'm gonna tell you somethin'. I can tell by the way that guy looks through his face that he's crazier than a shithouse rat. If you really need that boy, you oughtta put a collar on him and make sure he don't get outta the yard. What the hell do you think this is? That's just money, boy. That's all that is. That ain't enough. I want you to meet Bonnie and Alice. Hi. Nice to meet ya. How ya doin'? Would you hurry up? What? Hurry up! My new girlfriend, Angie. Hi, Angie. Nice to see you. Daddy. Come on, Daddy! Hey, Charlie. Hey, when are them coals gonna be ready? Hell, I'm so damn hungry I could eat fried pig shit. ...in a nice, sweet, sultry voice. ...like how an electric toothbrush can revitalize your sex life. We'd have the best damn show on TV. Savannah, I want you to take Timmy home. You take him. You're drunk. Well, I'm just rememberin' how much you hate scenes. So don't be jerkin' my reins. You need a hand? I thought I might... help you skewer a while. No, I'm just... Honey, could you hurry up? They're really getting hungry. Don't be pickin' on Charlie. He's doin' a fine job, and I'm helpin' him. See? Yeah, well, we're running out of dip... of everything, you know? Well, hell, if they're that hungry, we might as well feed 'em right now. Well, goddamn, girl. You wanna party, you got a party. Whoa! Ho-ho-ho-ho! Charlie, do something! The meat is on fire! Charlie, please do something, goddamn it! Charlie, do something! Soup's on. - Cat to Charlie. - Yeah. I got a blue pickup... with a top over the bed, just picked up nine or ten. Get after 'em, my boy. Out. Spread. Well, I guess you got me, huh? Yeah, I guess I did. Bajense, amigos. Todos. La linea. La linea. Thank you. Well, look here. Nice work, Charlie. This old boy and his amigos must be runnin' ten loads a week. I don't know nothin', man. It's just work for me. Oh, yeah, I know. Yeah. I'll take it from here. Where you takin' him? Back to the station. You take care of the Wets. Transportation's right behind me. Fuera del carro, seores. Let me tell ya, this has been one hell of a day. What? This is my fourth load since I came in. Tules along the river were full of 'em. If they paid us by the head, we'd all be millionaires. Got it? I got it, Stan. Well, take it easy, Charlie. Partner, how we doin'? I ain't in this for murder. You hear me? No way that I'm in this for murder. Easy, Charlie. Calm down. You're killin' drivers. And don't tell me I don't know what I'm talkin' about! 'Cause if I don't, where's the driver you took in today? He ain't in there! And he ain't in there! So where the fuck is he? He pulled a gun. Oh, he didn't have no fuckin' gun! He sure did. You fuckin' missed it! Ah, bullshit! That old boy near got me, 'cause you didn't fuckin' search him good! Don't bullshit me! Listen, Charlie, you're all steamed up. Now calm down. Listen to me. I'm sure you can appreciate somethin'. We got a business situation here. These independents get too big, that comes out of our end. - So, what, you just fuckin' kill 'em? - We take care of business. That's all we do. We take care of business. You see this fuckin' line? This line right here I don't cross! This fuckin' line right here! Listen, you asked me to let you in. I ain't exactly payin' you dog-squeeze. I don't care about your money! You took it! Your life is gonna be fly shit before I ever get involved in murder! You understand? Do ya? Okay. Okay. I can respect that. Seriously, I can respect that. Now, now, now I know. Now you know. Jesus Christ. There's times when I feel like there's a whole other person in there. He just isn't the Charlie Smith that I married. Oh, they've all got their secret sides. Thelma's ready for you. Okay. The other night after dinner he went around the house and looked at the Nu-Vue... and everything, and he turned to me and said, "Marcy, what the hell are we doing here? What the hell is the point?" The point? Yeah. And I said, "The point is, honey, that we're happy." And he looked at me... real funny, sort of sad like... and he said, "So this is all it takes to make you happy." And I felt real scared, Savannah. He was standing right there in the room with me, and... I felt all alone. Oh, honey, I wouldn't worry about it. You just keep that sweet thing buttered up. He's not gonna wander too far from home. You know what? You look like my husband. He'd fuck a woodpile if he thought there was a snake in it. Well, I've fucked a woodpile or two myself. I bet you have. Well... it doesn't really matter, does it? I read somewhere in a poem that everything is just a dream. Whose dream is it? I don't know who's dreaming. Well, then it doesn't matter, does it? Guess not. Motherfucker. Juan! Do you remember me? Yeah. How you doin'? Okay. Where'd you get the sneakers? Same place I get this watch. You boostin' now? Only work for money. Comprende? Si. Donde esta su hermana? Busca a mi hermana? Cinco dolares. Cinco dolares. Cinco dolares. Vamos. She don't wanna work here. Why? She have to earn money, get baby. What's the matter with the baby? Is it sick? Esta enfermo el nio? No, they took the baby. She have to earn money or no give back. Hiya, Charlie. Como estas, amigo? What would you like? Cerveza? Tequila? How about some whiskey? Anything you want and it's yours on the house, free. I came over to talk to one of the girls. Oh, you want some pussy. Pick one you like. She's yours for nothing. I'll talk to this one. Esta? Nil, Charlie. She's only good for go-go dancing. We got some girls you're really gonna like. Come on. I got some really fine pussy for you. Que le paso a tu nino? El nino me lo robaron. Esta zafada.

Hey, Charlie, that kid you got today, that driver- - How many Wets that sucker have? None. Yeah, well, it says here he had two. Two for San Antone. Who typed this up? Honk. Then Honk fucked up.

Sometimes them suckers... are hunkered down there pretty low you can't hardly see 'em. I know how they sit. Honk confused my driver with another driver. Van was empty. We only caught one driver today, Charlie. Hey, Beef, if Charlie says the van was empty, the van was empty. Write it up again. Kid was probably stoned or boozed or somethin'. Heck, can you imagine if he had made San Antone? He opens the door and no one's there. Hey, Charlie. How's it goin'? Here. Huh? What are you waitin' for? I looked. I'm tellin' ya, I looked. Come off it, Charlie. I looked, goddamn it, and there wasn't no fuckin' Wets in that fuckin' truck! All right, you keep on tellin' yourself whatever it is you wanna believe! All right? But it ain't gonna change the fact there's a pair of Wets... in the back of that goddamn van! Now you listen up, Charlie. I'm gonna cover you on this, but from now on, you do exactly like I say. If I say a pissant could haul a bale o' cotton, you don't question me... You just hitch that fucker up! Now you go ahead and push them pepper bellies in that goddamn hole! What's wrong now? Is somethin' wrong now? No, nothin'. Charlie! Honey, what are you sitting there for? Charlie, what's the matter? Oh, God, honey, you look exhausted. What is it? It's all right. I love you.
