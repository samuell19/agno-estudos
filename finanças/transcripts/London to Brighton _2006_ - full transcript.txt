- Fuck off! - Ow! Fuck. What are you doing? Fuck off! Come on. You've got to stop now. Come here. I've got to get it off you. That's it. That's it. Do you want some food? I'll get you some food, all right? Go in there. Stay in there. Don't open the door to anyone. Wait! Are you gonna come back? - Yeah. - Please. I promise. I will. I'll bring some food. All right? Got a fucking problem? Look the fucking other way, then. Can you put the toy in, please? We'll have to get the train, go somewhere. We ain't safe here. I've got a mate in Brighton. He don't know her. We'll go there for a bit. - What'll that man do? - Don't worry. He ain't gonna find us. Look, you're gonna have to stay here. You're gonna have to stay here, in the cubicle. I've got to go and get some money, so we can get the train. - What about my money? - Later. Can you stay here? - For how long? - An hour, hour and a half. - I don't want to be on my own. - I know, but you can't come with me. Look, just wait here. I won't be long. All right? - All right, mate? What are you after? - What have you done to your face? Nothing for you to worry about. Look, do you want something or not? Go on, get in. Hello? Hello? Is someone in there? Hello? Hello? Come on, open up. It's me. Are you all right? Where have you been? I told you, I had to go and make some money. Right... Come on. We're gonna get the train. ..your personal belongings with them at all times. Unattended luggage can cause unnecessary security alerts. Here, go and sit on that middle one. It's gonna take about an hour, so why don't you have a kip? What about that man Derek? He ain't on the train, so don't worry. Are we gonna go to jail? I told you: No. Now, go on, have a sleep. - I'm not tired. - Yes, you are. Here you are. Now, use this as a pillow. The window'll shake. Stop it! Stop it! Fuck off! Stuart, what's happening? Stuart, what's going on? Fucking hell. Get me a drink. He's had a girl here. Find out who she is. You were nothing when I first saw you. Don't fucking 'don't know' me! I am not a fucking charity. Now, I've been shelling out. All right? I ain't made of money, so I need you to do this for me. Derek, please don't... What? What do you think I'm asking you to do? How long's she gonna be? We've got to be back at work in half an hour. Fuck off! Just wait a minute. All right, come on. Stop this now. All right? Come on. You're the most beautiful girl I know. Do you know that? When I first saw you, I thought you was like a star or something. You know? And do you know what's more? Hmm? We've got a future, you and me. Something really good. Do you believe me? Come on. Do you believe me? Yeah. Right, good. So, get in there and fuck 'em for me. All right? They've come down a long way. They're good friends of mine. You're beautiful, you are. You know that? You are beautiful. All right? Go on. In you go. She's coming in. Don't take all fucking night, either. Give us the cornflakes, will you? Go on. We're in a hurry. The door. I need 200 pound off you. I thought you got me here to give me something. I ain't got anything on me right now... Oi, oi! D! - Who the fuck are you? - Stuart Allen wants to see you. - W-Why? What for? - Just leave your cereal and come on. Phone Kelly. Find out where the fuck she is. And when they're finished, I want 'em out. Come on. - Is this for me? - Yeah. You look nasty. Do I? Cheers. - How are you doing? - All right. I love the countryside. It's nice, innit? Seeing a bit of colour. Why the fuck did you run away? Cos living at home was shit. Mum's dead, in't she? And my dad was a bastard. He beat me. He was always pissed. The other week I nicked his fags, and he kicked me in the ribs. - It's big, innit? - It were massive last week. - Does it hurt? - Not as much. What a pair, eh? Me and you. Black and blue. - Where are we going? - To stay with a mate for a bit. Stay away from London. He's just called, so no doubt he's found out. He owes me money. You ain't gonna see that, love. Look, I'll get it for you. All right? I love the fields. It's a shithole, this place. How do people live like it? Dunno. Well, you live like it, don't you? How do you mean? All this scum round here. That's who you deal with, isn't it? Oi, cunt! Stop, you can't fucking park over there, mate. - So, you know who I am, then? - You know what it's like round here. Yep. I'm talking to you, big man. Fat cunt, open the window. You can't just fucking sit there. And as for Laughing Boy in the back, I don't know what he's fucking about at. But it's too much, mate - you can't fucking park here. We told you. Ouch! - Shut up and fuck off. - All right. Fuckin' hell! Fucking toerag girls. That's who you deal with, isn't it? Girls like this. Yeah. How often did my dad ask from you? What do you mean? You can take me for a stupid cunt if you want, but one of those boys will cut your ears off. I'll ask you again. How often did you get my dad a girl? A couple of times. Three or four. What kind of girls? I don't know. He likes them young, don't he? Did you get him a girl tonight? And don't fucking lie to me. Yeah, I did, yeah. How young? She was about... 12. Do you know what she did to him? No. No, I don't know anything. One of the other girls went with her. Honest. - Where are they now? - I don't know. I thought they'd still be there. Well, they're not. Who was the other girl? Her name's Kelly. What's happened? What have they done? - I want those two girls. - I'll find them. You better had. And then you're gonna call me. - All right, I will. - Have you got my number? - No. - Get it off him. Find those two girls. And if I don't hear from you by this time tomorrow... ...you're a fucking dead man. Get out. Let's go. Chum, come and pick me up. They've cut my fucking leg off. Yeah, I'm outside the J-Mo. Get Kelly on the fucking phone. Find out where the fuck they are. They've done him over or something. I don't know. Just get a fucking move on. What do you wanna do? It's too early to call her yet. - Can we go to the beach? - What for? I wanna see the sea. Come on, then. Who's that? - Open the door. It's Derek. - It's six in the fucking morning. - I know what time it is! Just open the fucking door. All right, all right. Hold on. I'm coming down. He's coming down. So, you haven't heard from her, then? I've told you, I've only met the girl twice. - Well, come on. Let's have it, then. - It's my dad's. - Well, he won't need it for ten years. - Fuck off, Derek. - If he finds out, he'll go mental. - I'm only borrowing it. Look, he ain't gonna find out, unless you tell him. I don't fucking believe this. What are you gonna do with it? I'll keep it on me, in case I find her. You're gonna kill her? Fucking depends. Look at my fucking leg. Do you want shells? What else am I gonna fire out of it? I want it on me, in case Stuart Allen comes after me. I'll kill her myself. I'll shoot them both in their stupid fucking heads, getting me in this mess. Look, you should just give them to Allen. Finish your coffee. I'm going back to bed. Make sure you bring it back. I love this flat. Lucky cunt. Thank you. Oi! Hang on. Wait. I'm going in the sea. Don't be stupid, you nutter! What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm playing. It's bloody freezing. You'll catch pneumonia. - What took you so long? - It's only an hour since you called me. Well, I told you it was fucking urgent. Well, I didn't have the money for a cab, did I? So I had to get the bus. - You got anything for me? - I only saw you this morning. No, I ain't. Go on. - Duncan Allen called. - Yeah? - Do you know who he is? - Yeah, course I do. Chum! - Yeah? - Go and sit in the car. What for? Because I'm talking to Kelly and I want a bit of fucking privacy. Take your phone with you, so I can call you. Yeah, I've got it. Right. This goes no further. OK? This is between you and me. - What is? - Duncan Allen. He wants a girl. All right. Book me. No. He wants a young girl, don't he? - How young? - Younger than you. I don't know. 10, 11. - He's a nonce. - It doesn't matter what he is, does it? He wants something and he asked me to get it. - Yeah, but a kid? - Look, don't start, Kelly. I need to find a girl for tonight. - Well, I don't know anyone, do I? - Well, go and find someone, then. No, I ain't doing that. No fucking way. Don't be fucking silly. Yes, you are. Look, I'll give you 200 quid. - It's a little girl, Derek. - I know it is. He asked me, didn't he? I do fucking know. If I don't find her, he'll get one from somebody, so I might as well. Or he won't come back to me, will he? I don't want to fuck him off, do I? I don't know. Where would I find someone? Can't go out and fucking kidnap some kid. You don't have to, do you? You're gonna give her some money. Go down Waterloo and the Embankment. Find a runaway. They'll need the money. Well, I want more than 200 quid. Bollocks! All right, look, I'm gonna have to give her at least 100, aren't I? I don't know. Look, find someone who's been doing it for a while. If she's out on the streets, she's bound to know a bit, ain't she? Kelly, if I don't find someone, I am in the shit, so help me out, please. I've fucking helped you enough times, ain't I? I'll have a look. I ain't picking some fucking innocent. Well, you don't have to, do you? You find someone who's been doing it for a while and give me a call. Fucking hell, Derek. Right? Now, go and get looking. I need her for tonight, Kelly. - Well, I want these fags. - What? - Well, I ain't got none, have I? - Well, take them, then. I want some credit for my phone, an' all. All right, later. Use a payphone. Oi... Tell Chum to come back up when you pass the car. Excuse me, mate. Have you got 20p? Thanks. Excuse me. Have you got any loose change? Thanks. Do your mum and dad know you're begging? - How much you got? - Enough. - What, for a cup of coffee? - Piss off. - Let's have one of them. - What's the magic word? Give me a fag, please. - How old are you? - 15. Fuck off! How old are you, really? 12 this year. Have you got any money? You just told me you had money, you fucking liar. Who are you calling a fucking liar? - You're a runaway, are you? - Yeah. - How long have you been out here? - Couple of days. - What, no-one looking for you? - He don't give a fuck, does he? - What's your name? - Joanne. - Do you want something to eat, Joanne? - Are you gonna pay for it? I ain't. Stay here a minute. All right? I'll get you some food and fags. I won't be long. I'm just gonna make a call. Don't go anywhere. Yeah, I found someone. I don't fucking know, do I? All right. Well, where do you wanna meet? All right. Yeah, I'll see you in half an hour. All right, bye. - Come on, then. - Who was that you was just calling? A mate of mine. He'll get us both something to eat. - Why? - Cos he owes me. Come on. He'll get you some food. Come on, then, if you're hungry. - You hungry, are you? - Starving. - Where's all your bedding? - I haven't got any. - Are you on the streets? - No. I have been, though. Shit, innit? It's better than being at home. - All right? - Move over. All right? - What's your name? - Joanne. Derek. - She's been out a couple of nights. - Where have you been staying? She's just asked me all that. - How old are you? - Nearly 12. Do you want something else? Some ice cream or something? Yeah? Mate! Ice cream, please. - What flavour do you want? - Chocolate. Chocolate. So, who looks after you, then, Joanne? What do you mean? Is there someone who takes care of you, out on the street, in case you get into any trouble? No. I can look after myself. Cheers. Who are your parents? Why are you asking me all this fucking stuff? Cos you can help me out, can't you? I need someone like you. Someone with a bit of fucking brains. Someone who can take care of herself. Well, how can I help you? Has anyone got to you yet? Since you've been out? - You been with anyone? - You what? What do you mean? Are you a virgin? Do you know what a virgin is? Yeah. So, are you one? Come on. Are you a virgin? Have you fucked anyone? You just told me you knew what a virgin was. So, are you one? Yes or no? No. All right. Are you all right? Just checking. All right? I just wanted to see how strong you was. - Do you want 100 quid? - Yeah. Why? What have I got to do? I need you to go and see someone for me. Who? Just a friend. Kelly'll go with you, an' all. Right? You spend an hour with him... I'll give you 100 quid. Why? Well, you've already fucked someone before - that's what you just told me. And you know how to handle yourself, so you go and play with him and I'll give you 100 quid. - When? - Tonight. In a minute. - 100 quid? - Yeah. Will you let me have it now? You are fucking sharp. Eh? You can have it afterwards. Don't worry. I've got it. Look. Do you wanna do it, then? Do you wanna help me out? Where have I got to go? Kelly'll take you. Right? 'Ere you are, look. Take that now. Go and pay for the food, while I have a chat with Kelly. - I ain't fucking doing it. - Shut your face. No, I ain't fucking doing it. That cunt... She knows what she's doing. Does she fuck! She ain't been with no-one. - Yeah, well, she'll learn, then. - I ain't fucking... Shut your fucking mouth, cunt. Cos I'm bang in trouble here. All right? Just make sure she behaves, and shut up. You all right? Yeah? Eat your fucking dinner, then. All right, I'll do it. I want the fucking other 50 quid, though. You'll get your other 50 quid.

Yeah? - Right. What do you want to eat? - Chips. Where are you gonna go, Joanne? Why? You don't wanna be back in London. You're too young to be on the streets. I'll tell you what. If I was your age again, I wouldn't be doing what you're doing. I could go and stay with my gran. I haven't seen her for ages, not since my mum died. My dad doesn't like her. I'll go stay with her. Anywhere but where you are. If Derek finds you, he'll kill you. Can we go to my gran's, then? - Where is she? - Devon. How am I gonna get you to Devon? Train.

That don't matter. I need to get some money. Oh, I ain't got any, Kelly. No, you're all right. I need to go and work for the day. Where can I go? I don't do it down here. It's early, anyway.

He caught me. As a punishment... ..he made me eat the whole packet. Everything. The filters. The cardboard. The little bit of silver paper you get inside. He sat there and he watched me eat the lot. I was throwing up every two seconds. He just watched me. Didn't look away. I never smoked again. Give it here. What did he do to you, then? Last night. Is he dead? Your dad. - I'm sorry. - Shut up. Stop crying. I want you to tell me what happened. What did he do to you? I'm not gonna ask you again. What did he fucking do to you? I can't remember. It was last night. Remember. He took me to his bedroom and... And what? He kissed me for a bit. And then he put me on the bed. Did he tie you up? Yes. Then he got a knife out. He said he wanted to hurt me. I screamed. I wanted to get out. What did he do with the knife? He was cutting my clothes. Then what? Did you fuck him? No. Why not? Kelly came up. She untied me. Did you stab him? Stop crying. Stop crying. Did you stab him? Yes. How many times? Come on! How many fucking times? Two. I think it was two. - You stabbed my dad twice? - Sorry. Sorry. What are you gonna do to me? Kelly! Please! What's he gonna do? Joanne! Joanne! Kelly, please! Kelly, help me! Get the other girl. Kelly, help me! Kelly! Get off! Kelly, help! - All right, you two. That's deep enough. - Help me! Fuck you. Fuck you an' all. Chum.'Ere, Chum. - Kelly, help! - Fuck off! She's a fucking kid, you cunt! Where the fuck are you going? You're watching this. Leave her alone! - Joanne, come here. - No! She's a fucking kid! - Get here now. - No! Please... Shut up. My dad's dead. Someone's gotta pay for that. Don't you fucking move, Derek. Joanne, take the trigger. Take the fucking trigger now. Pull it. No. Please... Come on. Shoot him. Do it. Do it! Do it! Pull the fucking trigger. Do it! Do it now. Help. Go back to your car. It's all right. Come here, you. Fucking cunt.
