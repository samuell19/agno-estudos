Listen up, everyone. This is a joyous day for the Leung family. Mom's managed to fully recover. Even the doctor called it a miracle. That's why we organized this party to welcome you home. Welcome home, Mommy! Welcome home, Mommy! - Cheers, everyone! - Cheers, Mommy. Mommy, I'm Wylie, your second daughter. In case she doesn't recognize me. It means a lot for everyone to gather here today, Mom. Shall we wish her a century of good health and beauty? - Sure! - Of course! I am 98 years old, do you want me to die 2 years later? - No! - Don't say that! No, Mom, you misunderstood Wylie! She meant to wish you eternal youth and beauty. - Exactly! - That's right. Mommy, I'm Chuck. Dad's trust fund is enough money for me. Just make sure my sisters get their shares. Mommy, I think their real wish is... for you to split up the inheritance, then travel the world. Watch your mouth, Fourth Sister. I know you want to sell the villa. What's wrong with that? The market's booming again! You hid the deed to the house. Think I don't know? Stop playing dumb and hand it over! - Hand it over! - Give us the deed! - I don't have it! - Bullshit! Big Sister! No! Hand the damn thing over! You hear me?! I'm not scared! - I'm not joking around. - Calm down! - Hand it over... - Don't do it! Mommy! Mom! Mom's standing... Mommy... Mommy... Mommy... - Go check on Mom! - Go be the good son! Mommy! Mommy, you're well again! You can walk! Mommy! My mother... stabbed me... I was wrong! I'm sorry. I won't do it again! I'm Ss rry! Mom, I'm your eldest daughter! Drop dead! Go to hell! Just die! Not my face, Mommy! You said you love me most, you monster! Fucker! I forgot to translate to you, your mom also said... ...you are a waste of space! Mommy... Mommy... Mommy... Mommy! I'm sorry. Your mom already died two days ago. What?! In the Philippines, we have a saying: "A place where a life ends is where another form of life is born." This is the real terminal lucidity. Mom! Mr. and Mrs. Yuen, as you know, Central is our financial center and Causeway Bay is our shopping center. This place has transportation, great food, and a harbor view! What's the markup on the harbor view then? About 20%. Take this flat as example. It's $25,000 per square feet for a 1,400 square feet flat. That's $34 million for the flat. What's important is that the subway station is just downstairs. Living comfort matters, don't you think? - You said before the markup just $80 per sq ft! - That's right! True, but the market rising like this proves that there's retaliatory inflation going on. It's unbelievably fast! How about this, kiddo? Show me a few more flats. Central's good... Oh! How about one in the Mid-Levels? Well... Are you planning to live in it or rent it out, Mr. Yuen? Rent it out. Renting... I got it! I have one in the Mid-Levels, above Central. Great! It's a steal! But there's no 13th and 14th floors... - Never mind... - What? Are you holding out on me? Why is it a steal? It's a death flat. Never mind! Stop right there. Sorry, I shouldn't have mentioned it. It's all right. I'll find you a good flat in Central. I'll call you when I have good news, okay? Wait here, honey. Hey, kiddo! Hey, kiddo! How much does that death flat cost? What's the discount on it? 10% below market rate. But compared to the place I just showed you... It's 50% cheaper. That's it? It's a death flat! $7 mil for 600 square feet is a bargain in Mid-Levels! How about this? If it's 20% below market rate, I'd be interested. Wait, sweetheart. The building has no 13th or 14th floors. Does that mean it's haunted? Hong Kong developers are superstitious these days. 13 and 14 are unlucky numbers in the West and the East. They'd rather not have them. The flat's getting a lot of interest. I'm meeting another buyer now. 20% discount, then we can talk! Fourth Sister, Big Sister will sell this house? I think so. So, what do we do with them? I don't know. The garden is a good place. Don't worry, we wait for the sun. They will be ghosts after waiting so long. But they're no longer human. - Stuff it in! - Eat up! Just stuff it in. Suck it up! Just stop. Your mother said she's choking. None of your business! I need towel, hurry up! We better sell the villa and split the cash, right? I agree. Remember to loop me in. Another flat viewing, Mr. Lam? Yeah. We just finished a viewing. He's also a property agent. See what I mean? Once bad luck passes in Hong Kong, people naturally resurface. and the market will recover! Yup! Our economy won't collapse. Just hang in there! We have to go. - Bye! - See ya. Jimmy Lam! You scared me to death! Why didn't you tell me you were doing a viewing? It was last-minute for me, too! It's pouring out there. Let's spend the night here. I haven't seen you forever. It's only been a few days. Look at this. I made this. I'm pretty sweet to you, right? It's tacky. Be honest. How many girls have you screwed in this flat? You're the first. But we can go to your place instead. Yeah, right. You must be one of those agents who won't date other agents. That's absurd! The market rate's moving again. Did your agency adjust this flat's price? You're talking shop again? We work for different agencies. Are there business secrets between us? Look, this is the truth. Even at different agencies, the flat is the same price. We wouldn't sell at different prices. We just react to the market. This flat costs $7 million! That's just 10,000 per square feet. It's easy to make a profit by renting it out. Your boyfriend's lived here for so long. Did I ever mess with him? Never. Because he's a decent chap for keeping the place tidy. When he stays here, he keeps a human scent around. That makes me happy. Feel free to give more flat tours. I don't mind! But you keep taking turns coming here... Seems like the market is resurrecting. But if you sell the place, I'm out of a home. Even been pressed by a ghost? Are you having fun? I'm having a blast. Even been pressed by a ghost? Isn't it fun? I've never done it like this before. How gross. Such a terrible habit. I have it, too! Back then, my wife, Sammie, loved me, called me adorable. But she doesn't love me anymore. She hates my snoring. Hey, I'm interested in that flat you mentioned. Have you talked to the owner? Yes, Mr. Yuen, I've asked the owner about going 20% below market rate. He's not interested. Forget it, then. I'm curious... How did the tenant die? Sorry, Mr. Yuen. It's not the tenant that died... - It's the owner. - What? How? He killed his wife, then he hung himself. I hear that her corpse hasn't been found. I don't want to hear that! Aren't you done moving in? - What's all this stuff? - Just a little more. In there. Why are you filming? Just protecting everyone. Evidence when you're behind on rent. How can you do that? No, no... Nine by ten feet, that's 90 square feet. 90 square feet? Yeah. Come on, Mr. Lam. You promised air conditioning, that's why I paid $300 more. That fan eats up a lot of power. I already gave you a $200 discount! Get in there. You're just moving the goalposts! That's enough. Who is he? It's just an altar. It's where we memorialize the dead. They watch over us. Someone died here? That's bad luck! It's fine! Haven't you heard of the guru's saying? "A place where a life ends..." "is where another form of life is reborn." No. Have you heard of this saying, then? "A place where a life begins is also where a life ends." This place is clean, Singh. - Don't worry. - We're clean. - Tidy up... - Are you sure? Clever girl! You can't expect me to ask about everything. Don't worry. Just think they are traveling around the world and never came back. The money given by your mother is big enough to feed my entire family. - Hurry, Mom, we're late! - Okay, let's go! Hurry, Mom! All right...don't move! Straighten it. - Mr. Lam! - Coming. What renovation do you want? You know, the rooms here are 90 sq ft each. Make them 80. - 80 square feet? - Right. - Is that legal? - You wouldn't get it! - Mr. Lam, how do I deal with this? - Coming! What's up? It's an altar space. How do I deal with it? Divide one room into two. Cut it up? You're really pushing it. You wouldn't get it! Keep it down, people are sleeping. Did your landlord hike your rent? Sorry, I'm the landlord. Really? Take this. Drag that all the way down. Go on... Stop! Eight feet... - Hey, why'd you let go? - Someone's holding it, talk to him. Lil' Keung, let go of the ruler. Landlord, since you're shrinking the rooms, how much is the rent? Answer me, man! Since my mother went into a coma, this villa's been an empty nest. We grew up in this place. Then my sisters got married and my father died. It's filled with memories. Amy. Wrong again. I drink milk and without sugar. I'm sorry, there are so many women in the family. I can't recognize who is who. Sorry. Amy has worked here since she was 19. We're really close. Miss Leung, I'd like to ask why you're choosing to sell the villa now. I hear the property market is turning around, so I wanted to get an estimate from you. I understand. But I suggest getting an estimate from a bank, too. It'd be more fair. This villa is huge, and there are a lot of trees outside. It's better to sort out land rights. My family owns the land, of course. Own the house, own the land. But it's better to sort out which part is government land. In case you'll have to go to court... So...if a developer wants it, what's a reasonable price? Real estate is Hong Kong's lifeblood, though fresh blood is rare. You can wait until the market is stronger to sell. How about this? If a property developer shows interest, call me, and I'll make the deal for you. It's best if our agency gets it exclusively. Exclusive? We don't want to mix it up with flats for speculation. Hearing you put it like that, I can rest easy. But Miss Leung, I... have an awkward question. Is your villa clean? My father passed out at home. He died on the way to the hospital. Is the home considered clean, then? Sure, it's very normal. - Looking for me? All right. - Have a seat. Remember the ant mover thing I told you about? - Sure. - I think it's doable. Move in at night, out in the morning. Make it seem like the homes are occupied. It's legal as long as the tenant signs a non-disclosure agreement. Then we're good. Wanna do it? I can't find tenants so quickly. You think you'll be the only agent? Get the unemployed to move in there. So many people haven't even had a whiff of a luxury flat. There will be lines out the door! The developers know that the first-hand flat vacancy tax is coming. That's why they made this plan to counter it. The vacancy tax will be gazetted soon. That's quick! Don't worry. The government can't move as quick as us. The big shot developers are on it. They know there's profit in it. It's better than paying the tax. How much do we pay? Market rate is $100 a night. Keep it occupied until it's sold. We have to get on it now! But the tenants have to leave every morning. How much commission are you expecting? This is hundreds of flats here. $10 a day from each flat would make you a fortune! We're creating the illusion of a city beaming with lights. Occupying it in daytime is fucking pointless! You're right... What is it? Mr. Wong and Jimmy Lam? I'm Lee from the lending firm. Take your time, I'll head out. Sit down. You guys, leave. Is this your signature? Looks like it. But I didn't sign this document. You're the guarantor of this girl who took off. Wait. She fled? Yeah, she's been missing for five days. You should call the cops. Maybe the signature was forged. Company policy says that all loans start at the debtor. The debtor has gone missing. The guarantor bears the debt. I'm responsible? I just said that it's forgery! Bullshit! Hey, watch it! We have a camera in here! You have 24 hours to find her. Otherwise... you're paying her debt. Give me an extra day. She didn't mention this the last time I saw her. When was that? Five days ago. Fine. You get two days. Hey, Peter? It's Jimmy. Have you seen Lily Wong from Great Land Property? No. Don't get caught calling your girlfriend at work, man. I just called to ask because she's missing. Missing? You should call the cops. No need for that. Hey, if you hear from her, please call me. Get closer! I know what I'm doing. Shit, he made the turn. How the hell did you lose him? - Jeez... - Damn it! Why won't you answer the damn phone? You scared me! I'm Lily I have no way out. That's why I didn't tell you. It was my fault. I shouldn't have taken a loan with your name to speculate stocks. FX, stocks, gold, I lost on everything. It's like a nightmare. It just took one day. And then it's too late. I'm so sorry. I should tell you, I heard ghostly sounds the last time I stayed over. You heard it? I was too scared... to look. Of course a death flat has ghosts! I burn joss sticks for them every night! What's the use? He doesn't want us to sell the flat! And he doesn't want us to live here! You're overthinking it. You don't see anything happening to me. You don't have to believe me. I'm leaving. Stay here tonight. Don't look! What's the matter? There's no loan shark here. It's just a debt. I'm helping you, aren't I? Why did you flee? Don't be scared. All right? Lily...Lily! This can't be real. Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily! - Who is it? - Come with me! Why'd you grab me? If you want to buy property, I can help. Property? With what money? Prick... Pay the debt, then we can afford one! I didn't borrow it! Is that so? We've taken over your debt. I want to see cash tomorrow! Give me more time. You wanna bargain?! That's right, scream louder. Let that bitch hear so she'll pay out of pity. Tomorrow! We got a live one! - Chop him! - Motherfucker! Why'd you chop me, Big Brother? Sorry, Little Brother. You've hurt our brotherhood! - Take this! - You bastard! Wh - Die! y'd you chop me?! Don't run! Pay up! It's locked! There's no way out! Buddy, can you spare my life? The hell I will! Fine, I'll do it myself. What happened? I forgot to tell you. I was a butcher, I'm used to this. Back in the day...haha.... This pales in comparison! Chop! Chop! For a butcher to afford a flat here is quite a feat! Don't say that. You've actually brought me a lot of joy. Hahahaha... Hey, kiddo, I've thought about it. I can't resist the temptation of a cheap flat. That death flat you talked about, The price isn't going up, right? Investment involves risk, market rates are subject to fluctuations. Spare me that! I'm going over later. Text me the address. Wait... Aren't you a Hongkonger? Speculating flats takes speed! I haven't even cleaned the flat... It's my fault. I work in a service industry, I should be accomodating... Beanstalk ghost. Thanks for today. Did you schedule a viewing, Mr. Lam? I did! Go on in! Thanks. Kiddo! Wow! It's post-modern! The owner must've been an artist, a real craftsman! It's a good recommendation, right? I was wrong to doubt you. Everyone dies. Why treat it with negativity, right? Right. Hey, kiddo. What happened to you? I had an accident. Gotta be careful, kiddo. Why isn't the Death Flat King interested in this flat? The price hasn't hit rock bottom? Isn't it low enough? It practically took a dive! It's high floor. Check out this view. With the rain, you can see everything. Go down by $2 mil, and I'm in. Mr. Yuen, the housing market is dying... Hell no, it'll outlive you! How about $6.8 million? No. $5.2 million, then we can talk. It's too low, I can't pass that to the owner. I'm off. Mr. Yuen! How about another flat in Central? How did they die? Two brothers killed their sweetheart then jumped off the building together. They fought mid-air... Wait...that's too cursed! You'll have to go lower than the market rate after Godzilla fought Kong. I'm going! Don't be afraid, crisis breeds opportunity! Hello, Mr. Yuen? I was wrong, kiddo. Speculation shouldn't involve too much logic. I'll take $6.8 million. When can I sign? Seriously? How about this afternoon? Can't make it. Tomorrow afternoon. Sure. Thank you, Mr. Yuen! I did it! Didn't expect this, eh, Lee?! You... Hand me your wife if you want to live! You're goddamn vile! Why won't you die, damn it? Obey and kowtow to me! Didn't expect this, eh, Lee?! You... Hand me your wife if you want to live! You're goddamn vile! What's going on? What are you doing? What the fuck? My intestines... Are you insane? My intestines are out! Come on... - My intestines! - What are you doing? What's wrong with Dad? I don't know! Why are they out?! That's for messing with me! Is this for Lil' Keung? We've burned him plenty of joss papers already. Did you see him? You'll see him eventually, too! Spit that out! I don't want to see him. Ask his dad to take him away. He'll scare me to death. A child ghost can't kill you! What a deadbeat, leaving his son... Lil' Keung had a rough life. His mother took off, then he died of gas poisoning at 4 years old. We were too careless... Should we get a taoist priest to do something for him? It costs a fortune. From the looks of it, the victim fell from above, hit the railing, then landed here. Her face is unrecognizable. There's no ID on her. We'll need a DNA test to identify her. Wong, she doesn't have a phone? No, but the two up there have phones. They have the same surname, they're probably brothers. Did the woman or the brothers die first? Definitely the woman. Look at her. Her body's rotten. She's been dead for at least two weeks. It's been raining all month. The rainwater washed away the stench, so no one found her. Impossible. How is it possible that no one smelled her for weeks? It proves that rainwater is more tender than sunlight. You have to ask Kai about night shift matters. Then hand me the security footage for the past month. All right. This can't be a coincidence, that's two fatal incidents up there now. That's a death flat, it's vacant. We got complaints about falling objects. We're here to look for clues. Sure, come in. Hey, why'd you call me here? A murdered happened in the woods, behind the building. Three dead. You know that people died in this flat? Yeah, it's my job to know. Do you tell clients how they died? If someone asks, I have to tell them. Is that so? Tell me if this sounds right to you: It's a stormy night. A girl is in love with two brothers. They got in a brawl over her. They landed on the balcony and fell off together. - The girl... - I can't sell the flat anymore, then. Two fatal incidents in the same flat... - It can't be a coincidence. - This is serious, will it be on the news? Before we solve the case, we won't let the media get wind of it. That's good, then my flat is still worth something. The victims most likely fell from here. The deaths happened here. Aren't you afraid of ghosts in this death flat? I'm in the property business. Serving the clients comes first. I need to take the call, officer. Hello? What the hell is going on? Wasn't the death flat in the Mid-Levels bought up by Mr. Yuen for $6.8 million? Yeah, he's supposed to sign tomorrow. Well, someone else snapped it up an hour ago. No way! Which agency? Your girlfriend's! Great Land Property. For $7 million! That's 200 grand more than you! Deal with this, man. Are you sure she's not dead? Where am I supposed to live now? Hello? - Hello? - What time do I sign the agreement tomorrow? I'm sorry. Another agency got to it first. We have to call it off. How can that be?! Shit! Was it sold for $6.8 million? $8 million. No fucking way! Who'd pay that much?! I'm really sorry. Hey! If I offer a higher price, is it possible to get it back? The agreement's already signed, Mr. Yuen. An agreement can be signed again, kiddo! Don't think I don't know shit about real estate! I was speculating flats before you were born! Mr. Yuen, be rational. Just tell me how much I need to pay! Tell me, kiddo, please! Tell me how much right now! - Let me make the calculations. - Great! I got it, Mr. Yuen. Excluding administrative fees, cancelation fee, commission, printing fees, legal fees and taxes, you'll need to pay $9.5 million. Sorry, Mr. Yuen, you should give up. No point in wasting money. No! I'm not wasting money. I just believe that Hong Kong still has a future. $9.5 million it is! Patriots like you will save our housing market! I'll help you! Hmm? Why is there a phone here? Where did it come from? Whose phone is it? I can use it if I charge it. How can you cook the same crap every day? I know it's annoying, I get it. - I hear you... - What a drag. Cook your own meal if you don't like it. Then it won't be too salty. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. You're acting so weird... You're goddamn vile! What the hell? How did you get in here? Get out, this is my room. It's mine! - Mine! - This is my room! This is my room! Let me go! Help, Landlord! What's wrong? Why the fuck am I flying?! - Help me. - What's happening? What's wrong? - Landlord... - Out of the way! - I hear you.... - Help me... Let me down! Help...Help me! This is serious! Get me down! I'm dizzy! Put me down! Ahh... Hey, settle down! Don't stand behind me all the time! What are you kids doing? Can't you let me sleep? Shut up! Have fun, Singh, I can't deal with this. One, two, three, four... I'm here, too! ...Five. Why are there five kids?! Lil' Keung, you're back! Ahh... Moving out? See ya. To hell with youl! Press that down tight. - Give Mom some glue. - Got it. Press it down, all right? Or it'll come off easily. Almost done now. - Let's post more down there. - Let's go! Come on. Sorry, Miss Leung, I've spoken to my boss, your mother's grave will take a few more days. Come on! I'm sorry, there's been a lot of deaths recently. Maybe it's good to have her around a little longer. Is this funny to you? Hello? Who's this? This is Jimmy Lam, I have the estimate for your villa. I can send it to you anytime. I'm a bit occupied recently. Well... I can deliver it to you myself. Keep it for now. Great, thanks. Mr. Lam, did you sleep here last night? I was working late and got tired. You can't do that, don't you agents have rules against that? We do. Get out before I get a complaint! All right. You know how to do smaller portions, right? This is a little different. With ten portions of noodles, make 12 to 13 bowls. Isn't that wrong? Who cares? Hongkongers don't count the fishballs in their noodles. Pour the noodles. Put in the fishballs. Pour the soup. Skimp a bit of noodles from each bowl. Use your skills to make equal portions. Wing, this can't go on. You need to take him back. You never hurt him, why are you scared? I know he's a good boy... This is discrimination. It's not! It is if you're scared! All right... I've brought his memorial photo, too. Apply for a niche with the government, all right? He only lived in coffin flats all his life. Then find him another home. I can't even pay your rent, and I may not find work. I know it's impressive that you've survived this long. Take Lil' Keung and find him a niche. Don't let him become a wandering ghost. Eat up. Here are 12 bowls. Does any bowl seem to have less noodles? Not really. What if it's 13 bowls? That's an unlucky number. Forget it, we've succeeded already. Hey! Your portion's gotten smaller! What? That's nonsense. Who counts the fishballs in a bowl of noodles? It's obviously smaller! What are you talking about? You don't have proof. You used to put four fishballs! - Come here, Mr. Chow. - I only got two. Look. We had four fishballs last month, now there are only three. I got proof. It's settled. Maybe the cook got it wrong. I'll give you some free fishballs. Just fishballs? It should be free meals! Free meals? Five meals, four bowls each. Mr. Chow, just because the landlord hiked your rent doesn't mean you can pass it on to us common folks. We can sue you, man. I'm sorry. Free meals it is... Splitting the inheritance is always a shameful act. But doing it makes us a family. So even if it leads to tragedy, we have to do it. It's amazing that Mom has recovered like this. Too bad Fourth Sister doesn't want her out of hospital. Amy... Come! Go drive my car, take me to the market. And then go to Third Sister's house, OK? You need to cook, cook dinner tonight. Come before six. My house hasn't been cleaned for a week. Make some time to tidy it up. It's a mess. Fourth Sister, I am leaving. Goodbye, Fourth Sister. I'm sorry. I apologize to you... on behalf of my family. No need, Fourth Sister. Thank you very much. Jimmy, squatting in the dead's home is nothing to be proud of. Why don't you move? No one's living in it anyway. From an ecological standpoint, I'm doing society a favor. - Society should thank you! - Totally. She's finally responding. You're at Mid-Levels Chateau again? "I'm not going." "Then forget it." Wait, I'll go to Mid-Levels Chateau right now! Let's see if I know this guy. I don't like you selling my flat! It was a normal, legal transaction! You should be happy that we sold it in this state! Don't talk back, shithead! Hey, you! Hey! Excuse us, ma'am. Take it easy. Jimmy Lam, come out now! - Pay up! - Or we'll splash paint here! Hey! Don't touch my flat! Is this a prank? Run! What dimension are we in? What the fuck! - What is this?! - We're in the air! We're stopped! Why are we floating? Someone's here... Help us! Perfect timing. Amazon delivery... - There's a ghost! - A ghost?! I'll send another courier! 22nd floor? I didn't press it. Neither did I. Why are you out at this hour? Let's go home! You're all pale! Slowly... Oh, no. Buddy. That's a lot of sweat. So you're Lily Wong's boyfriend? And her guarantor? Loan sharks are stalking me. I'm worried for my safety! You asked me out here to tell me this? Who the hell are you? You prick... We watched a month of security footage. We only saw you. We never saw Lily Wong. Then we realized that the dead brothers are loan sharks. When you left that night, you were covered in cuts. Then one day, you went up to the 23rd floor but you left from the 12th floor. You vanished for three minutes. Why were you on the 12th? I saw that the 13th and 14th floors were missing, so I checked it out. The biggest mess also started on the 23rd floor. Two men who went to the 23rd floor vanished. Flat D's door was smashed. Then a mystery man knocked out the lobby guard. The old lady who took an elevator with him fell ill. I have to suspect you, Mr. Property Agent. Your girlfriend's family filed a report. It's a missing person case for now. On the surface, Lily took out a loan, then ran out on her debt. But you could be her accomplice. Maybe you took the money, played innocent, then pushed her off the building. We'll find the truth sooner or later. Let me warn you... There's a 99% chance that she's the corpse in the woods. What are you doing? It's just a short split with your girlfriend. Don't tell me that you property agents have feelings. I hear you're brutal with slashing home prices. Stop playing sad, our housing market needs you to save it. Let's go. Did you sleep here again, Mr. Lam? Sorry, I was exhausted and fell asleep. You can't do that. "Oh, Mama..." "You put me on this earth" "Oh, Mama..." "Like the moon facing me" "Love is gravity, no?" "Oh, Mama..." "Let me live in this..." "humble abode..." "There's nowhere else I wanna be" "You said, 'Don't be afraid, have a cuppa." "Some words..." "If they can't be said, use the guitar" "La La La La...Mama, can you hear me?" Miss Leung, do you remember me? Miss Leung. You're...Mr. Lam? Yes. I came to say goodbye to a friend, too. My mom's death was very sudden... I'm sorry. Thank you. Why are you alone? Where are your sisters? My sisters and brother went to travel the world. The helper you met returned to the Philippines, too. Well...we'll talk some other time. - Sure. - Take care. Hey. Honey, look who's back. Is it Lil' Keung? Don't scare me. Come look. Dad. You've met my wife. I had these two brats with her. You can call them your little brothers. Say hi to your big brother. - Big Brother! - Little Brothers. It's rare for the family to get together like this. Have a drink with your mother. Mom, I'm home. Cheers. She's from Chongqing. A decent lady. She's open-minded enough to put your mom's photo here. Thank you. It's okay, we're family. What's with the luggage? Are you moving in? Never thought about it. Oh. But can I stay for a few days? A few days? Of course it's no problem! Lil' Keung's room is empty. He won't like it. Lil' Keung is never coming back. You two haven't drank together in forever. Have a drink. Cheers, Dad. Your big brother grew up here, kids. He's the first generation of subdivided flat kids. That's not true, Dad. The first generation was cage homes. Subdivided flats is the second generation. Really? And now there are nano flats. It's the third generation of poverty flats. Subdivided flats! Your word choices are so bad. You have terrible luck. You missed Hong Kong's golden era. It doesn't matter to me. Chongqing is developing better than Hong Kong now. If I hadn't married my way here... Then you'll just be a country girl. Country girls are a part of society, too. Yeah, the lowest part of it. You have nothing to do with it! I got lucky, my mother left me a flat. I have the right to hike rent. Isn't that a big corporation privilege? You're really something. I offered you a flat so you can get a better one later. But you said you won't be a slave to a flat. I was worried that you wouldn't have a home to die in. Then you didn't listen and became a property agent. Did you get yourself a luxury flat? Luxury flat?! - When can your little brothers visit? - I wanna go! - I wanna go, too. - I wanna see luxury flats! - Me, too! - Okay. By the way, I picked up a new project. I need a few hundred, maybe a thousand people. It's easy. Just go to a flat at night, turn the lights on, sleep, then move out the next morning. It pays $100 a day. You need that many people for that? It's simple, just keep the lights on. Make the city lights beam all over. City lights beaming? That's beautiful. Jimmy... Over Hong Kong's history, people speculate anything and everything. You're not considered an HKer if you don't do it. You know that better than me. There are so many people without homes, but so many homes without occupants. Pearl of the Orient? More like Bowel to me! Fourth Sister, you said that Mom told you to resuscitate her no matter what. We respect you a great deal for that. But she had no witness. Why should we believe her? You're right. I think this villa will make us a fortune. We should ask Lau, the property agent, about it. Sure! What the hell? I got here first! Sorry, let me go first! You do this every time! I'm on my period. Be a gentleman, all right? I'm gonna pee my pants! Wow... - Wow... - Come and look! Wow... Impressed? It's my dream house. Isn't it huge? It's so pretty! Drive faster, Big Brother, we'll be late! Don't worry! Hey, who's that Lil' Keung that you guys talk about? Did your dad forbid you from talking about it? That's fine, you guys can take the bus tomorrow. - No! - No, Big Brother, please! "Heartless landlord divides death flat into ten coffin flats." "Four-year-old child dead from gas poisoning..." We're home! - Open the door. Bye! - Bye! Careful going home. I need to park, go upstairs first. - Bye! - Bye! Mom, we're home! We want snacks! Me, too! - Okay, you can have some. - I need the toilet. - What do you want? Jelly noodles? - Yeah! Want spicy ones? We want super spicy! I want mild! - Okay, wash your hands before eating. - Wash your hands! What's going on? Let me down! I live in this home, too! I want to eat with you! It's not my fault! Help! - Open the door! - What's happening? Baby Open the door, Fatty! Come out, son! Open the door, Fatty! - Open the door! - What's happening? Run! Is Lil' Keung back? Didn't you give his memorial tablet to his father? I did! What do you want?! What's with the racket? There's...a ghost! A ghost? Yeah... You said I'd never come back?! ow! This is my home! Lil' Keung, your dad abandoned you? Then it's better to be back. Don't be naughty and come down. Why did you kick me out?! l...I...1 had no choice. Be good and come down. You're a bad man! Come down and we'll talk. You watch too many violent movies. Let's talk! You called my dad useless and tried to kick me out! I didn't...Fine, I'll do better. I'll cook you anything you want, okay? Please stop scaring us! Please! You're Lil' Keung? I'm a property agent. I promise that you'll have a home. You'll have a home... A luxury flat! You'll live in a luxury flat! Don't lie to me! I won't. I never lied to you, either. You steal my curry every day, but I never said anything. You sit in front of my fan, too! How can I sleep with my fan blocked? That's enough.... - I'll blow you away tonight! - Don't! Don't hurt the kid! - He's just a kid! Don't hurt him! - It's no big deal. No big deal?! I told you before, Landlord! A place where a life ends is where another form of life is reborn! Go to hell! - No! He's just a kid! - Don't! He's gone! It's just an illusion! It's okay now! It's attacking! What are you doing? Are you choking me? Who are you? - Start the train! - Vroom vroom... Vroom vroom... - Start the train! - Vroom vroom... Off we go... Let's start the train! Let's go! Vroom vroom... Into the tunnel! Vroom vroom... Look. Isn't it nice? An ocean view. And... you can see a beautiful sunset there. It's like a giant egg yolk! Have you seen it before? Are the building materials nice? Of course. It's a luxury flat. Their marbles and tiles are all shiny and smooth. You know why? They're made in Italy and Spain! Italy and Spain? All the luxury flats use their stuff. That's why they have the best technology. All their marbles and tiles stay shiny and smooth. Look. It's awfully swell. The developer also did the design and put in the best appliances. And it only costs $48 million. Think about it. It's better than these 80 square feet rooms, right? How's Lil' Keung? He loves it. You're great at this! Everyone! I've got good news! This is Jimmy Lam, my son. He's the man in charge now. He runs the lights-on-lights-off project I mentioned. Singh, my friend. You're a foreigner. Do you know what our Hong Kong dream is? What does he know? I don't know. Didn't you say you're a Hongkonger? Just tell me already! It's for everyone to have a dream house. We're all staying in luxury flats tonight! And we'll get paid every day! - Really? - Yeah! Getting paid! Great! You can all rest easy now! Of course. Come here... As for the accident today... You'll all get compensated for it. If you don't like it over there, you can come back to the coffin flats. No one wants to do that. Of course not. Let's pack and make our Hong Kong dream come true! - Shall we? - Yeah! How did you convince Lil' Keung anyway? The fancy brochure did most of the work. True, who wouldn't live in a luxury flat? You've got taste, Lil' Keung! Jimmy! Good job. But the government has sacked the vacancy tax. What? Don't worry. The developers still want to try it for a month, in case the government goes back on their word. Call this a rehearsal. They'll still get paid. Whatever, just pay me once a day! Of course, you've been a great help. Luxury flat! No more coffin room! - We'll be so happy. - Hello, hello, hello! The owner of Mid-Levels Chateau, flat 23D died many years ago. Who'll sign the contract? You mean the ownership never changed hands? Yeah. If that's the case. How can we sign the flat over? Maybe you can raise the owner from hell to sign. Doesn't your agency renew its files annually? The flat was already on the market when I joined. Okay... Did he have offsprings? Many things pass down generations. Who knows how many generations have lived in a flat? Your new girlfriend is also someone's ex-girlfriend, get it? Sure. Let me talk to my agency. I get it. Getting a ghost to sign documents... Who the hell would believe that? But... They do need to be signed. And as you know... Interim contracts have time limits. If I don't see you in a week, it's a breach of contract. I get it. - But from a legal perspective... - Stop right there! Don't think about loopholes. The greatness of Hong Kong's laws lies in its fairness. - That's right. - That's the spirit of our rule of law. So...it must be signed by the owner. Got it. What are you doing? Stop it! This is illegal! Since I took over the family business, this is how things have always been done. Yes, demanding a ghost's signature is a mockery of our profession, but it must be done, because we're in a service industry. The bank ads keep saying don't pay an intermediary. That's absurd! lllogical! You're smart. Selling this flat in a recession proves that people are more scared of homelessness than ghosts! Get this done for me! I'll die if I go back! You won't! Ghosts need homes, too! Ghosts don't kill, they just scare people. Why don't you go, then? I want another 40%. Then we won't make any profit. This pandemic has really hurt our industry! Properies are our life! Beanstalk Ghost, it's Jimmy. I want to talk to you. Come out. You've got balls for coming back. I sold the flat for you. I came back to ask you to sign the contract. You really have a death wish. It's a great price! The client's paying $9.5 million! That's a tempting amount. HK dollars or joss paper dollars? Joss papers, of course! 9.5 million of joss papers? Honey, where are you? That's not a bad payday... Hey... Sammie, do we want joss papers... or keep the flat? Can you come out and talk? You really hid your wife... inside this flat? Of course. I'm not the first man in Hong Kong to hide a corpse indoors. It was your fault! You forced me to get a divorce... Forced me to sell the flat and give you a bigger share... Forced me to chop you into pieces. Sammie...Sammie...l didn't want this for us. Chop! Chop... Don't be upset. Once you sign the contract, you can buy her a better life. That sounds great, but there are two names on the flat's deed. What? Take a look. No way! It was hard enough to find you. Sammie... Stop being so fucking annoying! You've never lost someone you love. You don't know how it feels. I lost Lily. Oh, I remember now. What do you remember? Sorry. I heard her talk about selling the flat the other night. On a rainy night, while your girl was here, you brought a foreign couple here for a viewing, right? Great, thank you! Bye! Yes! I sold the flat! I couldn't stand her looking so happy about selling the flat. My home was sold for such a cheap price. I couldn't tolerate it! I worked all my life for this flat. - So I threw her off the building! - What? Soon after that, I heard you open the door. I couldn't possibly let you in. - There'd be trouble. - Something wrong? I'm sorry. I don't know why the door won't open. The old couple even peeked outside. But who could see anything in that rain? Not long after, you gave up, then you left. I guessed you weren't all that serious about the girl. But Sammie and I are different. You goddamn butcher, you're a murderer! I really am. That's why I hung myself. Look. Look. A hundred deaths aren't enough for you! I sold the flat! You can kill me! Why kill her? Sorry... Sammie... Sammie... Hey. You two are dead. Go home and eat with your mom. - Go home and eat! - Big Brother... That hurts! Pay up! Ah... Why'd you kill my big brother? Pardon me, I'll come back another day! Wait! I haven't signed the contract! Oh, right... Big Brother! ow! Don't kick my brother's head! Big Brother! ow! Big Brother! Are you okay, Brother? Stop talking and run! Sammie! There you are! Come out! Sammie... You poor thing, I chopped you into pieces. I can't even put you back together. I'm sorry. What name should she sign? What are you playing at? - Take this. - 1 got it... I'll chop you up! What the fuck is going on? Boss, Jimmy Lam's here. Your boss was right. Here you are, shithead! What boss? Threatening me with a bone? Motherfucker... Here's the contract! Use the contract as collateral. That'll pay Lily's debt, right? What about the interest?! That's more than enough. The flat is worth over $20 mil. $20 million?! A shithole like this?! Big Brother, help me! Don't insult my flat! I'm the owner! Owner? Don't believe him! This is a death flat! It's worth nothing! I'm not selling! Leave! Where's your humanity?! Fuck, you're for real?! Chop... Chopping people is illegal! Chop... Pick up that prick! Don't let the blood get on me! Don't you go anywhere, shithead! Go queue for your own flat! Why are you messing with mine? Don't you dare leave! Run, there's a ghost in there! - Don't let him leave! - You got us killed! Pay up! Intermediaries are slippery pricks! Grab him! Hey, something's up. It's human bowling! Jump! Jump! - Jump again! - Hop! Jump! What does it want?! - Don't let him leave! - Chop him up! Stop fucking running! Fucking Freeze! - Pay up! - Don't be so stubborn! Give me that contract! No! Give me the contract! I won't! Kid, it's dangerous here. - Go home. - Another ghost?! Leave! I'm not joking around! Let Jimmy go! Go away. Get off... What are you doing? What do you want?! Stop! Why are you biting my intestines?! Bite somewhere else! Ahh... Get off... I'm a ghost, now leave! We're the ghosts here! What about me? You again?! I hate bullies! Go! Get down, Lil' Keung! - Rest in pieces! - 1 don't wanna die again! ...or a third time... You're still here?! Out of my way! I worked so goddamn hard for this flat, and now you're forcing me out? Where am I supposed to live? Hmph! Are you scumbags jealous of me? That's right, let's all die and be homeless! A young man like you should've leeched off your daddy. 2021 is the ideal year for you to die. Get down. Let me go! I forgot to tell you. My signature alone has no legal standing. - What? - Be glad that I'm not killing you. Kid, take him to hell and have Yamaraja sign. I don't believe you anymore, asshole! I'll give you a glorious sendoff! Kid. Separations are inevitable. Take him away. Let's go, Jimmy. - I won't! - Let's go! Those who trespass shall suffer miserable deaths! - 1 won't go to hell. - It's the Underworld. Follow me! We're here, Jimmy. This is the way to the Underworld? Yeah! I've been nice to you, don't lie! You have no choice! Hey, you want me to sign a property contract? Who are you? Yamaraja. I need two signatures, is that okay? I'm Yamaraja. What can't I do? Haven't you fucking cried enough up there? Smile, cockface! How can I smile? Beanstalk Ghost killed my girlfriend... He's squatting on the property of the living! I know he can't bear to lose his home, but separation is inevitable up there. If you're lucky, you'll see her in her new life. You can't stay here, so give me the contract. Looks like some serious shit. I'll delete the term about the 999-year land ownership. Why? Who'd buy property without that term? What's the point? Can you live that long? I'm changing it! That's illegal! Don't worry. The greatness of Hong Kong's laws lies in its changeability. There! I'll give you 99 years instead. That's plenty of time to speculate. Speculate land to your hearts' content. You HKers love it. Now you can do it for three generations! Scram! How do I leave? Leave the same way you came in. Want me to hold your hand, cockface? You scared me! I was repairing the garbage shaft. "Lights off, I don't need entertainment this moment" "Rest, I just want to sit quietly" Super Rider! "Today, you say you have no future here" "If we're apart, how am I supposed to love?" "Cut the story short" "Rewrite the initial expectations" "The visuals and characters have changed. Let go quietly" "If we're apart, I won't know how to love" "Separate, one at a time..." "Separate, leave me to dig out the moss..." "Separate, one at a time..." "I look forward to your return someday" Come on, stop... I have to go. I have an idea: If this flat doesn't get sold, Let's get married and live here. That'll save us a fortune! "I can only practice to let go every day" "And remain here like that moss" "I don't want to live a future without you every day..." "Let me let go, I don't want to love again" Good job with the land report, Mr. Lam. - Have some tea. - Thank you, Miss Leung. You know, your property's perimeter is really big. You don't need to live here. It's nice to be rich. My parents left us so much that we don't have to work for the rest of our lives. We must accept the saying, "Wealth lasts for only three generations." But we mustn't blame ourselves. The family business didn't die in our hands. My sisters were good daughters to Mom. When Mom fell into a coma, they visited her in the hospital every day. When she woke up later, the doctor called it a miracle. The sisters and I think we should sell Fourth Sister's flat. - Is that okay? - Yeah! Sell them all at once! The market's doing so well! It turned out that she woke up from terminal lucidity. She died soon after that. She'd been dead for three days when we found her. When people leave, they become ghosts. And you? Is your mother in good health? My mother...died many years ago. I'm handing the sale of the villa to you. Exclusively. You're an entrepreneur now! Thank you so much. We're here! Let's go! - It's so pretty here! -Isn't it? - It's so pretty! - Take a good look. It's so much bigger than our home. This is a serious upgrade. It's not just a villa. It's land! Land! Land... Wanna rent? What color are you? Is...Is orange okay? Wow! Come take a look. It's a new home. Enjoy! Impressed? It's my dream house. Isn't it huge? Careful!
