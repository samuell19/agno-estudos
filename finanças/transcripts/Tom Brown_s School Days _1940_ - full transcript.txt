Oh, hello. Tom, can't we be friends again? He wanted it. He always wanted it. Tom, I... I hope he's watching us and understands. He always understood, didn't he? He was great man, Tom. People didn't always think so, but my father believed in him from the very first day he met him. That was years ago. But he still talks of that day when he drove to Dr. Arnold's home. Dr. Arnold, please. Yes, sir. But he's teaching, sir. I'll wait. Please forgive my husband, Mr... Brown, ma'am. My husband is a private tutor, Mr. Brown. He makes it a rule never to interrupt a class. A very proper man. Now, Westcott, tell us what you know about our war with the United States. Oh, that thing, sir. DR. ARNOLD: Yes, that thing. Well, sir, the colonists didn't like our tea and so there were a lot of skirmishes. Well, the colonists didn't fight far and hid behind trees, so our soldiers got disgusted and sailed home. That's very patriotic, Westcott. But inaccurate. Are you eating in class, Baker? What's the matter with your face? Toothache, sir. Take that taffy out of your mouth. You told me an untruth, Baker. Remind me to birch you, afterwards. Yes, sir. Westcott, perhaps, you had better inform us about the 2nd Punic War. Oh, yes, sir. Hannibal crossed the Alps with his elephants and the Romans came out to meet him. Does it strike you as odd that you know so much more about something that happened in Italy hundreds of years ago? No, sir, that's history. And our war with the United States? That's just modern, sir. And like an honest English schoolboy, you know nothing about it? No, sir. Westcott, why did we learn history? To find out what the Greeks and Romans did. Someday it may also be thought useful to know what the English and Americans did. Very well, boys. DR. ARNOLD: Tea ready, Mary? Mr. Brown has been waiting to see you, Tom. How do you do, sir. Don't think I've had the pleasure? No, sir, you haven't. Brown, sir. Squire Brown, they call me of Buffington, in the Vale of White Horse. We're a large family, we Browns. Not very distinguished, of course, but in our humble way, the backbone of England. Pinch of snuff, sir? No, thank you. No! The cat will have it. [SNIFF] Pity it's dying out. Mr. Brown, to what do we owe the honor of this visit? Oh, yes. You've been very successful here, Doctor. The most successful private tutor in England. SQUIRE BROWN: Pity your scope is so limited. But it has advantages, Mr. Brown. Here in my own school I have a free hand. I can train boys in my own way without interference. Did you ever hear of Rugby School, Doctor? Naturally. The trustees are looking for a new headmaster. So I've heard. And wherever we go one name is brought forward. Really? Yes, sir, yours. Dr. Arnold, I've been sent by the trustees to ask you to stand for election. But that's impossible. But try, dear. The trustees would never accept me. My ideas are too revolutionary. But that's just what we want, Doctor. You know our schools and nurseries are iniquity of vice. We want a revolution. Nonsense, Mr. Brown. Englishmen never want a revolution. Thomas, please. That's right, ma'am. Now you talk to him. I'll step into the garden and admire the azaleas. Oh, Thomas! Think of all you could do. But we're happy here, Mary... Our own ways, our own boys. 10 boys. You're giving your life to 10 boys. And what would I do with 300. All the things we've talked about. All your theories and your plans. But they're experimental. They're right. You know they're right. I'd turn the whole place upside down. Of course you would. If you were headmaster of Rugby you would... You would change the face of education in England. 300 boys, Mary... The youth of England. To teach them to govern themselves, to teach them to know what is right, to mold them as courageous, God-fearing gentlemen. Please, sir. What is it? I was to remind you to birch me. [LAUGHING] The youth of England, Mary. And it eats taffy in class. [LAUGHING] STUDENT: Hello, Thomas. Hello, sir. What's he like? Rum, sir, very rum. Rummiest headmaster I ever did see. Isn't going to be a nuisance, is he? We can only hope, sir. But when he opens his mouth, we'll know the worst. DR. ARNOLD: I come to a great school where all the brothers from every association is splendid and elevated. But the schools of England are being criticised. They say that they are corrupted and changed from the likeness of God's image to the likeness of a den of thieves. And it is for us, for you and for me, to remove that reproach. And how can this be done? You who are boys in our schools today may tomorrow govern a great nation. But those who are to govern others must first learn to govern themselves. Our schools must no longer be based on tyranny. The headmaster is the chief tyrant and the assistant master are the lesser tyrants. They must be based on the determination of each of us. All just and reasonable beings to do what is right. And in return for this freedom, I require your confidence, your confidence and your honesty. Lying and deceit I shall never forgive you, for freedom demands responsibility. Those who are oldest and wisest amongst you, the sixth form, will have a special responsibility. Like officers in the army, you will maintain discipline, you'll encourage the weak, and chastise the offenders. [WHISPERING] The man's a radical. But each one of us belongs to a great and a famous school, the reputation of which we are concerned to defend and to improve. And it is for us to show our fellow men that Rugby is now no longer a school of savage barbarians, but a school of courageous, God-fearing gentlemen. I'll give him a year. I'll give him six months. Moral principles! What's a school boy got to do with moral principles? Feed in one end, beat the other, that's education! We are safe as houses. With a headmaster like that, huh! You can get the lions, I'll get the bait. We're courageous God-fearing gentleman and we're hungry for ducks. [DUCKS QUACKING] Hey, I got one! (SINGING) We'll knock him down and box his ears. No more laughing, no more glee. No more sitting on a hardwood seat. And the dear headmaster, will interfere, we'll knock him down, and we'll box his ears! Ha, ha. Hey, you thieving, young rascals, you! And there they were, as brazen as you please, a-gorging themselves on my fine ducks, what I get four shillings for at market. That's not true, farmer. Oh, yes it is. You're new here, Doctor. You don't know Rugby lads like I do... liars and thieves who have been stealing my ducks and chickens for 20 years. Yes, and a very good thing you must of made out of it at four shillings a piece. You will be paid no more than the market price, two shillings. That's all, thank you, Mr. Jenkins. Very good, sir. Once more, and I beg you to consider your answer very seriously, did you steal those ducks? No, sir. We were never near his place. McPhail? No, Sir. Green? Of course not, sir. But you were all three together this afternoon? Yes, sir. Very well. This is your knife, I believe, Barrington. Your initials are on it. Yes, sir. You dropped it near Farmer Jenkins' duck pond. [BELL RINGING] DR. ARNOLD: I told you that it was my passionate desire that the boys of Rugby should learn to govern themselves. But I also told you that I would not tolerate lying or deceit. For he who governs himself must be honest in thought, in word, and in deed. But you lied to me! Expulsion is a serious and a lasting disgrace. It brings sorrow to your parents and calamity to yourselves. Rugby is greater than any three of its boys. And there is no longer an place for you in this school. You did what you thought right. It was right, Mary. It was. Those boys were liars. And liars will poison and corrupt. I cannot begin until I got rid of them. There will be more expulsions, more suffering, more misery. Better to have but 100 boys here, Mary, 60, 30, as long as the few are honest, God-fearing, courageous. [BELL RINGING] If this is modern education, huh, thank heaven I'm old fashioned. He'll have to stop soon, there will be no one left to expel. I thought as you had called a meeting of the trustees, you would like to see what "The Times" says about you. I have already read it, thank you, Mr. Grimsby. Very awkward, all these letters about your expulsions. Quite a storm of protest. Why, some of them might almost have been written by you, Mr. Grimsby. On the contrary, I have received letters of protest myself. So have I. McPhail's father, Barrington left the country. It appears I'm a heartless villain who delights in expelling boys, ruining their future and breaking their parents heart. Perhaps you would care to read them. But your methods are revolutionary, sir. They are intended to be, Mr. Grimsby. Yes, sir. Some day, I'll throw that man downstairs. Old Grimey is the least of it, Mary. Mr. Brown, sir. Good day to you, sir. My respects to you, ma'am. How do you do? Are the other trustees with you? They are not, sir. They express their sentiment by staying away. I'll go. No, ma'am, I want you to hear what I have to say. Will you call the meeting to order, Doctor. Mr Brown, when I accepted this appointment it was on the condition that I was to have a free hand. I do not intend to offer my resignation. You are, aware, I suppose, that public sentiment is against you? It is not my habit to yield to public sentiment. Do you him in that, ma'am? I do. In that case it's my duty to inform you, sir, that I'm with you with all my heart. I respect your methods. I admire your courage. I'll back you to the end. That's a very brave attitude, Mr. Brown. Brave, sir? No, stubborn. We Brown's are stubborn and proud of it. And just to show you how stubborn I am, I'm going to send my own son to Rugby. Good bye, Charity. Good bye, Master Tom. Bye Jacob. I had sent your father off to school, from this very spot I did. Was he very brave? Ha, ha, bawled like a cow. Dashed if I'm going to cry. Ha, ha. Ha. This here pea shooter, made it for you me-self, I did. Hit the master's nose at thirty paces, ha. Thanks, Jacob. Bye, Nanny. For your cold feet, Master Tom. Thanks, Nanny. You may kiss me just once. But no trimmings, mind. Thanks for not saying be a good boy, wash behind your ears, and all that. But you will, though, promise you won't forget. SQUIRE BROWN: All right, Tom. Come along. Goodbye, everybody. Goodbye! Goodbye, Tom. Come back here. Judy come back here. I suppose the women blubbered over you properly. Ma... Maggie was an awful mess. I don't see why... why people can't have more self-control. Your quite right, my boy. When we meet the Rugby coach, would you mind very much if I don't kiss you when we say goodbye? There might be some other boys. I know just how you feel. I said the same thing to my father when I went off. No, we'll just shake hands like two old gentlemen. Thank you, sir. The Rugby coach will be here directly, sir. Thank you. Drink it up, Tom. Nothing like starting off warm. Excited? Yes, sir. Got the key of your trunk? Yes, sir. Here's a sovereign for you. You may find it useful. Oh, thank you, sir. Well, I suppose there's no good giving you advice. Boys, never take it. I know I didn't. But you stick to Dr. Arnold. I don't understand half he says, but bless my soul if he isn't on the right scent. I'll do my best, sir. I know you will. Tom! Yes, sir? I don't talk much about it, but you mean a lot to me. [KNOCKING] The Rugby coach is here, sir. Here you are, Sam, the usual. I'll rare tackle that on a cold morning. [LAUGHING] Goodbye, Father. Goodbye, Tom, my boy. [SOBBING] Let them go, Nick. Do you know Rugby by any chance? Goodness, Lord bless ya, sir. I go to it every day of me life. What sort of place is it, please? Slow place. A very slow... only three coaches a day. And one of them a two horse one, more like a hearse than a coach. The life of the school, sir. What? Oh, that's to say I'm a new boy. Oh, I thought as much. A nice, quiet gentlemen like you. Are the boys pretty wild? Wild? Oh, we gets us all kinds of rows along the road, what, with their arguing and their pea shooters and so forth. I've got a pea shooter. Yes, I see you have. I dare say you will be as big of a varmint as the rest, ha. [HORSE WHINNYING] Come on, Nellie. [LAUGHING] Here we are, sir, Rugby. Rugby! I say, you, fellow. Is your name, Brown? Yes. My father knows your father, and he asked me to take you in charge. My name is East. How do you do? Is this your trunk? Shabby, isn't it? Take it up to my room. - Right, sir. - Uh, give him six pence. Six pence? Look out about it or no more jobs from me. Thank you, sir. Give him your coat. We don't wear them here. Oh, I'm sorry. What's that on your head? A cap. Only louts wear caps here. If any of my friends saw you with that helmet, you'd know not what would happen. A new boy, needs a hat. I see that, sir. Try that one. Too small. SHOPKEEPER: How about that fit? Too big. Splendid. How much? Oh no. Chalk it up, T Brown. And, uh, burn this. With pleasure, sir. Now the first thing you've got to learn to do is to hang on to your tin. Tin? Money. Oh. I say, you haven't got any tin to spare, have you? Well, my father gave me a sovereign. Splendid, we'll have some murphies. Murphies? Potatoes, young'un, potatoes. I say, you are green, aren't you? SALLY: Not a murphy we have till I see the color of your money. No money, no murphies. That's been my motto for 40 years, and I'm not going to change it now. What do you want, Master East? Murphies, Sally. Murphies. Your father still owes me for when he was here. We have a sovereign, my good woman. When I sees it I'll believe it. Show here our money, young'un. [WHISTLING] Gold. EAST: Don't swallow it. Bring us some murphies. Yes, sir. - East? - What is it, my boy. Is this the new fellow? Mm. Nice looking, isn't he? What about introducing us? If you like. Brown, these are a couple fourth form pests. The tall one is Diggs and the short one is Tadpole. How do you do? Very hungry, thank you. There you are, sir. There's your change, sir. Very hungry. Haven't you got any tin? We're broke. Temporarily embarrassed. Gave my last sovereign to a beggar. Funny thing, my father owns half of Yorkshire and I can't afford a murphy. Uh, that's a shame. Isn't it? East? EAST: What is it, young'un? Would it be all right if I got some more for your friends? Would it be all right? Wait. Well, young fellow, that's not a thing we generally let a new boy do. But, uh, seeing that your a friend of East... Sally, three pairs of murphies. DIGGS: Six pairs of murphies. TADPOLE: Nine pairs of murphies. SALLY: Oh! Old Grimey! Please, sir, it wasn't... GRIMSBY: You can explain that to the headmaster. Great Teddy. You may go up. DR. ARNOLD: Come in. Now what is this disgraceful affair? Who are you, boy? Brown, sir. Brown? I'm the new boy. Oh, yes, of course. Why didn't you report to me before getting into mischief. I didn't know, sir. Do you realize that you might have done somebody a serious injury with this? That isn't mine, Sir. I didn't shoot it. Now, come now. Don't begin by telling lies. But I didn't, sir. I tell you I didn't. What happened? Well, you see, sir. There was a bird... Well? And someone aimed at the bird, and suddenly old Grimey just got in the way. Old Grimey? You mean, Mr. Grimsby? Yes, sir. Then... then everybody suddenly disappeared, and, well, there I was with... With that in my hand. I believe you, Brown, because you are your father's son. And because a liar would have told a much more plausible story. Oh, thank you, sir. You wouldn't like to tell me who the someone is who aimed at the bird and brought down Mr. Grimsby? No, sir. I couldn't do that. No, I thought not. So you're the Squire Brown's son? Yes, sir. This is an important day for you. Yes, sir. An important day for the school, too. A new boy is always important. He may be an influence for good or for evil. Your father once did a very courageous thing, Brown. I know that you won't fail him. Now, run along. See that the matron has the keys for your trunk. Yes, sir. Brown? Yes, sir? Remember, from now on I trust you. Never hurt me by breaking that trust. I promise, sir. DR. ARNOLD: Very well. [BREAKING GLASS] The doctor let you off all right? Yes, thank you. Tadpole's pretty smart, isn't he? Is he? Of course, if Dr. Arnold had known it was Tadpole who did it, he would have tanned his hide out. Oh. Brown, you didn't say it was Tadpole who did it, did you? Oh, no, of course not. Well, that's all right. Remember, my boy, never tell tales. It isn't done. East? Yes, my boy. The doctor is wonderful, isn't he? Doctor, he's all right. The fellas in the sixth form think he's one of the best. I don't take him seriously. Is this your study? Yes, what's wrong with it? Oh, nothing, it's... It's wonderful. I'm going to let you share it with me. Uh, give me your key. Oh, do you really mean it? Yes, if you don't hang around me all the time. Don't forget, I can't be seen with a new fellow much. Oh, of course you can't. I promise I won't bother you. EAST: Mm, lot's of food, all right. Uh, strawberry or raspberry? Strawberry. Looks good. It's very decent of you to put up with me at all. Well, that's all right, young'un. I'm only doing it to please my father. He'll be good for a five pound note when I tell him how decent I've been. Fag! All right, East, your lot. [LAUGHING] Why are you so late? Oh, you're new, aren't you? Yes, sir. Well, it's not your fault. But remember, when a six former shouts fag, you run as quickly as you can. Yes, sir. WALKER BROOKE: It's an old Rugby custom. You lower schoolboys have to clean our boots, run our errands, and do anything else we need. Here, East, clean these. All right. Is that one of the masters? Masters? Of course not. That's old Brooke, head of our house. How wonderful. Do you think I might clean his boots some day? Here, you can do them now if you want to. Anything to make you happy there, old boy. Oh, thank you. Enjoying yourself, Flashman? [LAUGHING] Hello, who's this? Uh, a new fellow. What's his name? Uh, Brown. Very unusual name. Most distinguished. Welcome to Rugby, Mr. Brown. [LAUGHING] Anytime I can help you, just let me know. You know, that's my food you're eating. We're not complaining. The cake is a bit starchy, but it will do. And remember, when your family sends you more jam, tell them to make it black currant. I don't like strawberry. Oh, and by the way, can you sing? Not very well. Mm, that's splendid. Come on, kid. Whatever did he mean? Oh, that. Tonight's singing in hall and we get a double allowance of beer. New boys have to sing a song on their own. Oh. EAST: If you stop they make you drink salt and water. Ever drunk salt and water? You'll hate it. (SINGING) In Scarlet Town, where I was born, there was a fair maid dwelling... [CROWD SHOUTING] Made every youth well rue the day, and her name was Barbara Allen. Oh, in the merry month of May, when grief of fingers swelling, young Jimmy Brow on his deathbed lay for love of Barbara Allen. He sent his man to the place where... to the town where... He stopped. TOM BROWN: To the town where she was dwelling, you must come to my... Come on, drink it up. But I didn't stop. Yes, you did. Drink it up. WALKER BROOKE: Sit down, Flashman. But he stopped. I'll decide that. Sit down! Well done, young'un. And now gentlemen of the schoolhouse, "The Poacher of Lincolnshire." (SINGING) When I was bound apprentice in famous Lincolnshire, for well I served my master for nigh on seven years. Till I took up to poaching as you shall quickly hear. Oh, 'tis my delight on shiny night in the season of the year. As me and my companions were setting out a snare, 'twas then we spied the gamekeeper, for him we did not care, for we can wrestle and fight, my boys, and jump from anywhere. Oh, 'tis my delight on a shiny night in the season of the year. [CHEERING] Well, you managed to upset Flashy, all right. But I didn't do anything. Flashy likes getting his own way. Take my advice, young'un, and don't irritate the boys. It doesn't pay. Oh. The night would have been simpler if you had drunk the salt water. Where's Brown? Ah, Mr. Brown, the great vocalist. Ever been tossed in a blanket? I don't think so. Splendid, cure for obstinate boys. Takes them down a peg or two. Come on here we go, fellas. Ashley, you take and end. All right, Brown, in you go. Keep your head down for anything they have. That's better. Around the other way more. - Go and keep a look out. - All right. I've got a grip on it. I say, Mr. Brown, are you coming? Come on, here we go, fellas. Grab the corners, fellas. That's it. Hurry up there. Come on. Think you're going to enjoy it, Mr. Brown? Yes. He thinks he's going to enjoy it. [LAUGHING] Now then, all together. Once, twice, thrice. GROUP: And away. Still enjoying it, Mr. Brown? Yes. Once again. I'll do it for him. We're not interested in you. All right, a real one this time. Right. GROUP: Away. And away. And away. [LAUGHING] FLASHMAN: Now then, all together. Ceiling this time. Ceiling you fellas. One, twice, thrice. GROUP: And away. The Doctor! Get up, and keep your mouth shut. Don't take that. Tom! Come on. I can't get up. You'll walk on that leg, even if it's broken. What are you doing out of your room? I'm sorry, sir. Well done, young'un. You didn't do too badly. Oh, thank you, East. It's only just twisted. It will be all right in a minute. See how we do things here? Never tell tales and never give anyone away. Of course, I don't care for Flashy either, but telling tales just isn't done, even with him. Well, goodnight, young'un. Goodnight, East. [KNOCKING] Come in. Good evening, Brooke. May I come in? Oh, I didn't know it was you, sir. I just came to bed. Yeah, so was I. Sit down. I don't suppose you would care for a cup of tea? I'd like some very much. Splendid. Schoolhouse match tomorrow, hm? Yes, sir. Are you going to beat the rest of the school? We've beat them for the last six years. Are you going to do it again? I hope so, sir. Thank you. Brooke, tell me, do you suppose there's any bullying going on here? Yes, sir, there is. I can't put my finger on it, but I'm sure it's starting again. Well, I suppose it's only to be expected. Last year the sixth form wasn't very... it wasn't very strong. Now you're head of the house, Brooke. Yes, sir. And if I catch anybody at it... You'll give them a good hiding and enjoy it, huh? Yes, sir. I'm afraid it goes deeper than that, Brooke. You and I must build school opinion against bullying, so that no boy will stand by while another boy's tormented. Who makes your tea? Tadpole, sir. Ah, that is Martin. He makes the best tea in the house. I wish Tadpole would come and give my wife a few lessons. Bullying is a tradition in our school. But we must build a new tradition. And that's where I rely on you fellas of the sixth. Your authority rules the school, and you're influence sets its tone. It's you who make traditions. And that's a great responsibility at 19, isn't it? Yes, sir. But we'll stand by you, sir. Yes, I know you will. Well, goodnight, Brooke. Goodnight, sir. Don't work too hard tonight or you won't be much use to your side tomorrow. I won't. You know, Brooke, when I have confidence in my sixth form there's no post in England that I would exchange for this one. Thank you, sir. Goodnight, Brooke. Goodnight, sir. Your foot still hurt? No, it's much better, thank you, East. I say, you aren't going to be homesick or anything awful? Oh, no, thank you, East. Then what's the matter? I say, Rugby's wonderful, isn't it? [CHEERING] ATHLETE: Look on his borders there. Look out. Come on. I've got it! [CHEERING] Say, Get on him, quick! Put it down. [YELLING AND CHEERING] Come on, let's go! Now, run, sir. Jump, sir! [CHEERING] Well, gentlemen, we beat 'em. [CHEERING] Had a lot of charges there that would have carried away our house, but we beat 'em! Hurray! And why did we beat them? Your play. Nonsense! We beat them because we're proud of the school house. And we mean to keep it the best house at Rugby. Yay! Now, I'm as proud of this house as any one, but it's still a long way from what I'd like to see it. There's a deal of bullying going on here, and depend on it, there's nothing breaks up a house like bullying. Bullies are cowards. And one coward makes many. Now, I know a lot of you say, standby the good old ways, down with the Doctor. Well, let me give you a word of advice. In the first place, they weren't the good old ways, they were the bad old ways. And in the second, down with the Doctor is easier said than done. You will find him pretty tight on his perch and an old British custom with a handle. He doesn't meddle with anyone worth keeping, but look out for squalls if you go your own way and that way isn't the Doctor's. And bullying isn't his way. And it isn't my way. And isn't the way of any decent fellow in the house. So let's have an end to it. Well, and now I've done blowing you up and I'll give you a toast. We've drunk with three times three and all the honors. The toast that binds us all together, and those who have been before here, and those will come after, to the dear old school house, the finest house and the finest school in England! To the school house! Oh, uh, hello, Flashman. Oh, uh, hello, East. Do these Latin verses for me. If I must? And just why didn't you come when I called? Because you're not in the sixth form and you've got no right thank us. Oh, I haven't, haven't I? Oh. TOM BROWN: You leave him alone. [LAUGHING] And why must I leave him alone, my little man? Because it's bullying, that's what it is. And Mr. Brown doesn't approve of bullying. No, of course, I don't. On second thought, you had better do the versus. A bright boy like you! And do them at once. Must turn them in before third lesson. I'm not going to do them. Oh, don't be an idiot. I'm not going to. Why not? Because old Brooke said we should put down bullying. Oh, that's it. And if we give in to them it just encourages them and Brooke said about the Doctor and everything. Well, if you want to get skinned alive, go ahead. East? Hm? Do you mind if I don't do them? Are you serious? Yes, I am. Then I've got a better idea. Give me the verses. If you must make a fool of yourself, at least do it properly. [RECITING LATIN] Flashman! Yes, sir. Please come here. Yes, sir. This is capital, Flashman, capital. Thank you, sir. In some of these lines, I see a humility of character I did not think you possessed. Always try to be humble about my work, sir. Excellent. You're only one year behind the fifth. This may alter your position. Thank you, sir. Uh, read the last two lines, please. Uh, yes, sir [RECITING LATIN] Translate. I'm feeling. Ill, sir. Really I am. Nothing of the sort. Translate. Yes, sir. [RECITING LATIN] These little versus I did not compose them. [LAUGHING] Go on, Flashman, go on. Do not let the vulgar products of the crowd distract you. Yes, sir [RECITING LATIN] Give me, Master... [RECITING LATIN] Many lashes... [RECITING LATIN] I implore. It will be a pleasure to give you the lashes you request. Come and see me at 6:00. I always feel stronger after tea. You may laugh out loud, gentlemen. [LAUGHING] [WHISTLING] Hello, Mr. Brown. Hello. You're a great wit aren't you? (SHOUTING) Aren't you? No. That's right, you're not. And you're going to Old Grimey to tell him it was just a rotten joke, aren't you? No. Do you know what we do to new fellows who get above themselves? No. Is there a fire at the wall? You bet there is. Now Mr. Brown, are you going to Old Grimey? No. Are you going to Old Grimey? No, I'm not. Grab him by the heels. East! East! East! East! FLASHMAN: Shut up! TOM BROWN: East! FLASHMAN: You shut up. Let me go. Let me go. EAST: Where's Brown? It has nothing to do with you. TOM BROWN: Let me go. Let... FLASHMAN: Now be quiet. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. Now will you give in? No I won't. Hold him closer. [SCREAMING] I'm burning! Agh! Careful, Flashy, his clothes are smoking. Hold him closer. [SCREAMS] It burns! Let me go. Why you, little... [SCREAMS] Now will you give... he's fainted. Tom! Tom! Well, young'un, feel better now? Yes, thank you, East. Fine. Next time, keep out of Flashy's way. He's brave enough. Just a bit green that's all. I don't think he is so green. Why not? Well, he's made me feel small. Look at us. We've always been scared of the bullies and given in to them. Now a new fellow comes and stands up to them on his own. Yes, and look what it got him. But he didn't give in, that's the point. He didn't give in. Listen, everyone, if Brown can stand up to the bullies, why can't we? Because. We can't. But we've got too much sense. Don't be a fool. Why they would kick us to pieces. Not if we stick together. We're five to one. Besides, it would be worth it, then we can put down bullying, just like old Brooke said. We could put it down forever. I wouldn't mind risking a kicks for that. Nor would I. GROUP: Nor would I. It's a fight to the death, then. Fighting is the only thing they understand and we've got to give it to them. - I'm with you. GROUP: So am I. Any one else? Put up your hands. What about you? Are you afraid? Who said, I was afraid? I'm with the fourth form! Down with tyrants! Hurray for the revolution. [CHEERING] [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] Ow! They're coming. GROUP: Hee, haw. Hee, haw. Hee, haw. Hee, haw. Hee, haw. So sorry, sir. Oh, I beg your pardon. Dash it, the rat. [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] Fag! [LAUGHING] [SIGH] Ow! Ow! [LAUGHING] Ah! [LAUGHING] Get out of here. Well, gentlemen We've got them on the run and all we have to do is finish them off. Easy. But how are we going to do it? Easy. Don't keep saying, easy. It is easy. How? Well, I'll tell you. One of us has got to fight Flashy, single combat, regular rules. That would stop him forever. That's the right. EAST: If we beat him it would break his heart. Diggs, you're a genius. Yes, but who is going to do the fighting. Oh, you, of course. Me! But, why. Me? You're the biggest. You're the only one who would have a chance against Flashy. Oh, I think it's a rotten idea. Nonsense, it's wonderful. All you have to do is to insult him. And then he challenges you, regular rules, and you knock him into little pieces. Did I hear someone mention fisticuffs? (WHISPERING) What do we do now? (WHISPERING) Would it be better tomorrow? (WHISPERING) No, go on. Flashman? Well, my young fellow? Nothing. Splendid. Hello, Diggs. [LAUGHING] Why didn't you do it? Thought I might kill him. We'll never beat them now. TOM BROWN: Mr. Flashman... Look! You're a coward, and a bully, and a toady and you smell. [COMMOTION] Why you little rat. Come on. Fair fight, Flashy, fair fight. Regular rules, unless you're afraid. Better do it, Flashy, and teach them a lesson. All right, you've asked for it, you'll get it. [COMMOTION] Fight, Brown and Flashy. Fight! Come on, fellows. Fight, Brown and Flashy. Fight. Fight! DIGGS: Now come on you fellas, make a ring. Here Ashley, you're timekeeper. Oh, right. Come on, Brown. Kill him. Don't take too long about it. I won't. Time! Good luck, Brown. You'll need it. [FIGHT COMMOTION] Get him, Flashy. Three to one, Brown. Three to one, Brown. Three to one... Seven to two, Brown. Seven to two, Brown. Come on, get the center of him, kill him. I'm with you Brown. Come on, old Brown, Come on, I'm with you. Come on, old Brown. That's it, come on, Brown. ASHLEY: No. It's six to four, Flashman. Come on. Come on. [GASPS] Come on, get up. Get up! [YELLING] Oh. Oh, they're waving. Hit, him, Flashy, hit him. Time! [CHEERING] Splendid round. That's it, keep it up. Brown the bomb. You're taking a long time. It's your one chance, make it easy, and let him come to you. Finish him off, Flashman, he's making a fool out of you. Time! Steady, gentleman. Go on, come on. [FIGHT COMMOTION] I'll murder him. I'll murder him. Let me at him. I'll murder him. Let me at him. Let me at him. Let him have it. Come on, Brown. And take... Give it to him. GROUP: Oh! Two. Two. Three. Don't go so fast. Five. Three. Six. [CROWD YELLING] One. Two. Three. Two. Five. Three. Six. Boo! Belt him, come on. Give him one for the roasting. Flashman. So Flashman did it. The Doctor! [GASPS] Brooke. I'm surprised to see you here. The sixth form is expected to stop all fights. Yes, sir. These boys must be punished. Yes, sir. Congratulations, Brooke, the new tradition's coming along nicely. [CHEERING] Tom, you were wonderful. I didn't think so when you first came, but I've changed my mind now. [CHEERING] Look you, fellas, Diagones! Splendid, we'll put it up. Puts some hats on them. All right. [CHEERING] Eternal friendship. Eternal friendship. WALKER BROOKE: Brown, the Doctor wants to see you in his study. DR. ARNOLD: Have either of you anything to say? Yes, sir. I'm very sorry this happened, but I didn't start it, sir. Are you trying to tell me that Brown did. I'm only trying to be fair. Did you give Brown any provocation? Oh, no, sir. No tormenting or bullying. No, sir. Are you quite certain, Flashman? Absolutely. Very well, wait outside. Thank you, sir. Brown, I'm not going to ask you why you were fighting. I'm satisfied that you would not fight for a cause in which you are ashamed. But rules must be observed. Yes, sir. You knew the rules against fighting. Are you ready to take your punishment. Yes, sir. Very well. How many did he give you? Six of the best, but it was worth it. Go on you're next. Flashman, we have both failed. I have failed to influence your character. You have failed to understand that God does not give a man strength to persecute the weak. He who does so is a bully. A bully, sir. I'm not a bully. I've never persecuted any one. That's enough, Flashman! You make the mistake of thinking I do not know what goes on in this school. No, sir, I don't, sir. You tormented one of your school fellows who was weaker than yourself. Now I'm not punishing you for that, Flashman. There have been bullies in every school, in every community, in every nation. But sooner or later humble men will rise and throw them down. But I am punishing you because you lied to me. I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean... You lied, Flashman. And lying is a poison that will corrupt any country. You are a bully, a coward, and a liar. There's no longer any place for you at Rugby. You're not expelling me, sir. Oh, no, sir. I'll do anything, but don't expel me, sir. Don't expel me. My father, It will break his heart. I'll kill myself. I swear I will. I couldn't stand it. Don't expel me, sir. I'll do anything, but please don't expel me. I didn't mean it, honestly I didn't. I won't be a bully anymore, I won't. You've got to let me stay. You must! You must! Please, let me stay, please! I can't believe it. Nobody ever tells a tale. Something is wrong. It just isn't done. Who else could have. Two minutes after he talked to Dr. Arnold I'm sacked. I can't go home. I can't face my father. He'll disown me. He'll disown me. The most enormous spread you ever cooked. Murphies, sausages, tea and everything. Shall we have a celebration? Of course, Auntie. All the fourth form is coming. SALLY: But who's going to pay? I am. Uh, Effie, I'll heat the oven, bring on the murphies. Master Brown, you and your friends can eat till ya bust! You've got a great champion, haven't you? Yeah! Shut up! He couldn't beat Flashy in a fair fight, but he got his revenge all right. [COMMOTION] Keep quiet, you fellows, quiet. What are you getting at? What would you think about a fellow who told tales? You know what we'd think. But that's got nothing to do with Brown. Oh, yes it has. Brown couldn't beat Flashy, so he got even with him by telling the Doctor about the roasting. That's not true. Whatever you say. All I know is that your dear little. Brown saw the Doctor first. And when Flashy went in the Doctor knew all about the roasting. I say you, fellas, Flashy's been expelled for the roasting, not for the fight. Now perhaps you'll believe me. SALLY: Here you are, Master Brown. Fit for a king, if I says it myself. Sally, you are marvellous. And you, Effie. Oh, thank you. Thomas, run and tell them it's all ready. Yes, sir. And don't tell them about the sausages. They're a surprise. Great day for you, Master Brown. It's wonderful, isn't it? Wonderful. I can't believe he'd do a thing like that. But he did and that's all there is to it. Facts are facts. Come on, East, you can't stick with him now. Flashy got what he deserved, but he never told tales on anyone. Well, let him stick with him if he wants to. They're cold, Sally, you'll have to put them in the oven again. Well, I can't keep putting them in and taking them out. Oh, of course, you can't. Effie, cut off and tell them to hurry up. Yes, Master Brown. Where are the others? They aren't coming. But why not? Because you wouldn't listen to good advise. I tried to help you, young'un, but you went your own way and now your in for it. East, whatever has happened? Remember I warned you that we don't tell tales? Yes. Well, now do you know why they aren't coming? No. You saw the Doctor before Flashman. TOM BROWN: Yes. And when you came out he knew all about the roasting. It isn't true. Flashman's sacked, that proves it. The others don't think I told. What else can they think? They can't think that, they can't. You don't think that, you don't, do you, East? You don't! This isn't much use to me any longer. Oh, what a waste of good murphies. I don't believe... Aw, come on, cheer up, Master Brown. Eat 'em yourself. We'll help you. Won't we, Effie? EFFIE: Of course, Sally. It's a funny, It's the first time I ever tasted one of me own murphies. Sally? Yes, Master Brown? It's not that I don't like you or nothing, I just don't feel like it. Effie, there's a peck of cruel things in this world but there is... [KNOCKING] Go away. What you up to? Nothing. Will you put this letter on the coach? Thomas Brown Esquire. Yes, Master Brown. They wrecked his room, ma'am. And he seems uncommon miserable about it. He wouldn't try to run away? Looks that way to me. I've seen it happen before, ma'am. Thank you, Thomas. Brown, have you seen Dr. Arnold anywhere? I know all about that, Tom. Let's clear it up, shall we? Yes, ma'am. Poor Tom. But this sort of thing has happened before, you know. There was a boy before you came, who was ragged like this. He ran away. That wasn't very brave of him, was it? No, ma'am. It would hurt Dr. Arnold terribly. Mrs. Arnold? Yes, Tom. Is it... is it being a coward if you give in when everyone is against you? Dr. Arnold had everyone against him, but he didn't give in. And then your father did a very brave thing. And that helped him. I expect the Browns have always been pretty brave, haven't they? Yes, ma'am. Tom, dear. Dr. Arnold and your father are very proud of you, you know. And if you ever did anything cowardly, well, like that other boy did, it would hurt them terribly, wouldn't it? I expect it would. Dr. Arnold would think that he failed your father. Mrs. Arnold, he mustn't feel like that. I couldn't let him feel like that. No, of course you couldn't. Everything's all right now, isn't it? Yes, ma'am. [SNIFFING] Mrs. Arnold? Yes, Tom? You knew I was going to runaway, didn't you? Yes, I knew. You don't mean to tell Dr. Arnold? No, dear, it'll be just between us. Thank you, ma'am. I gave your letter to Sally, she'll put it on the coach. My letter? My letter! Has my letter gone? Master, Brown. Has my letter gone? Of course, I put it on the coach not five minutes ago. Oh, Jiminy. But didn't you want it to go? Oh, of course, I did but I don't now. Why not? Well, it was to my father and there was something awful in it about the Doctor, because I was planning to do something, but I've changed my mind and I must get that letter back! How? Oh, go after the coach, of course. But how? Oh, I don't know. Oh, yes I do. But that's my aunty's cart. I'm going to borrow it. Master Brown. It's a matter of life and death. Oh, I couldn't stand by and see you take it. But if I was to turn my back. Thanks, Effie. Two people saw a Rugby boy drive my cart like mad, and my poor mare what will probably never recover her wind. Is that all? Yes, Sir. Very well. Any damage will be paid in full, of course, Mrs. Harowell. Thank you, Sir. DR. ARNOLD: That is if it was one of our boys who stole your cart. Thomas, see if any boy is missing from the dormitories. Yes. You're going to search... Thomas, uh, take Mrs. Harowell with you. [TAP] He's locked out. Very sad. I suppose we had better get him. How? Or for that matter, why? It's too risky. If it were one of us it would be different. Young gentleman! You're telling me, after stealing my cart and my horse. [ARGUING] If I had my way, the villain would have his head cut off in the tower of London. THOMAS: Don't keep your pot boiling over. I'll soon find out whether it was one of my young gentlemen or not. Well, where on earth have you. Been? There was a letter and I had to get it back, so I took Sally's cart. Sally's cart? She doesn't know it's me, but she's been to the Doctor and she's furious. So, I saved your hide. It was jolly decent of you, after everything. After what? After all the awful things you thought about me. Well, don't think I've changed my mind. I'm not interested in you or anything about you. I never want to see you again. And if ever tell the others I was fool enough to help you, I'll bash your head in. Martin. Harris. Reed. Bradley. Douglas. Brown. East. East? He thinks it was me. I know he does. Well, don't be to calm about it. He'll tell the Doctor and I'll get the blame. Then all you've got to do is go to the Doctor and tell him it was me. But I can't do that. You know I can't. I'm afraid you've got to because I'm not going to own up. We'll make you. Oh, no you won't. You'll have to tell tale. Then they'll all turn against you as they have against me. And then you'll know what that feels like. You little swine. It'll do you good. But, East, please remember the facts. Last night you were out of your dormitory. Yes, sir. DR. ARNOLD: Last night a cart was stolen. Yes, sir. Last night a Rugby boy was seen driving that cart. Yes, sir. Were you that boy? No, sir. You stole the cart, didn't you? Yes. Then go to the Doctor and tell him you did. Let East tell him. You know he won't. None of us tell tales here, except you. Are you going to the Doctor? No, I'm not. You refuse to give me an explanation. Yes, sir. You realize that without an explanation I am compelled to believe that you are lying. Yes, sir. You know the punishment for lying? Yes, sir. Very well. You have courage, East. And few liars have courage. TOM BROWN: Oh, oh, No! It's no good. Better leave him alone. TOM BROWN: No! [CRYING] [BELL RINGING] He didn't tell. Taking a cart. That's something that boys will do, and a thrashing would be enough. But a boy who let's his friend be blamed for what he himself has done, he's a mean, despicable coward. But East didn't do that. No, Mary, it's worth than that. I've seen Sally and that girl of hers. There is no possible doubt that the boy I must expel is Tom Brown. [COMMOTION] [DOOR CLOSES] So you thought you could make him tell? Now you know how we do things here. [CRYING] If only he'd had the courage to own up. Mary, I have prayed that he might come to me. It's not too late. He may still come. Not now, Mary, not now. [KNOCKING] Come in. All ready, sir. Oh, very well, Thomas. Of all my boys, Squire Brown's son! He was to be the symbol of my success. Now he's the symbol of my failure. Not your failure, one boy's failure. My failure, Mary. He came to Rugby with every promise. Rugby has made him a coward. If I've failed with him, what of the others? I cannot reach any of them. It's no use, Mary. I can't go. I've deceived myself. I shall apologize to East and expel Brown, then I must resign. Please, sir, it was me. Please, sir, it was me. I stole the cart. I thank you, Tom. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. It's a record. And serves him jolly-well right. You don't like Brown, do you? No, I don't. I hear you think he told about Flashy? Everyone knows he did. Well, you young fellas jump to conclusions. As a matter of fact, it was you who told. I did? At the fight. Give him one for the roasting. I heard you, and so did the Doctor. Well, Master Brown, did he hurt you very much? Yes, he did. Funny thing was, he was so cheerful about everything. Brown, we seemed to have made a mistake. I'm awful sorry. So am I. EAST: Well, I'm not. You maybe all right, but I very much doubt it. This is a big school, Brown, and the less we see of each other for the next four years, the better. Sorry, young'un. But I'd probably feel the same if you made me go through all that torture. Nearly getting expelled is no joke you know. But he'll get over it in time. I wonder. [WHISTLING] Fag! Oh, here, you're new aren't you? Yes, sir. Well, remember, when the sixth formers shout fag you come as quickly as you can, another Rugby custom. Yes, sir. Here, clean these. Very well. Gentlemen of the school house. When I first came here, my father told me to stick by the Doctor. And let me tell you he had a powerful lot of enemies and it wasn't everyone who understood him. But I haven't got to tell you to stick by the Doctor. [CHEERING] You're all with him. The whole school's with him. And there isn't anyone who doesn't know that he's the finest headmaster in England. [CHEERING] And when you get to know him, the finest friend. He's strong and he's wise and he's true. And when I leave Rugby tomorrow there's one person I'll always remember. Yes, and if I'm not mistaken, the world will remember, Arnold of Rugby. [CHEERING] Oh, hello, sir. Oh, hello, Tom. Won't you sit down? Not in your chair. I'll sit over here. I hope you're feeling better, sir. A little tired, Tom. End of term. Did you finish your packing for tomorrow? Not quite, sir. DR. ARNOLD: Sad at leaving, eh? Of course, sir. Oh, we all feel sadness in the last night. But you have to look forward, Tom, Oxford next term. You'll find Bradley at Oxford. Remember Bradley? And Fenton. Ha, ha. The number of thrashings I gave that boy. Here is Douglas. He's in the Army now, in India. And Brooke. He was your hero, wasn't he Tom? Yes, sir. He would be very proud of you. And Harris, poor old Harris. He's doing quite well now. And Petrie, he's in the Foreign Office. He'll make a fine statesman. So many boys. And now you're going out into the world. God bless you, Tom. Oh, by the way, we just had an attack of spring cleaning and this turned up. I think I can trust you with it now. Goodnight, Tom. Goodnight, Sir. Master Ashley, coach money to Lincoln, one pound ten, sir. Here you are, sir. Master Tanner, coach money to London, one pound five. Is it true, Dr. Arnold's ill. Don't you count on it, sir. He'll be back here next year beating you as hard as ever. Goodbye, Jesse, good holiday to you. Goodbye, sir. [KNOCKING] Come in. The last coach will be leaving directly, sir. Yes, Thomas. THOMAS: Will you be saying, goodbye, to the young gentlemen? Of course. Give me my cap and gown. No, dear, please. You're not well enough. I've only been saying goodbye to the boys, Mary, since I came to Rugby. I do wish you wouldn't go. The boys are happy. I don't want them to know that I'm ill. There's the Doctor. Goodbye. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye, Alexander. Remember me to your father. Goodbye, sir. Well, that's the last of Rugby. Oh, no it ain't. You owe me six and six. You owe me halfpence. Goodbye, Ashley. I hope you have a nice holiday. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye, East. I'm sorry you're leaving us. So am I, sir. We didn't agree at first, but now we understand each other perfectly. Yes, sir. Going to Cambridge? Yes, sir. And Brown's going to Oxford? Yes, sir. Still distant from Brown? Don't you think it would be a good idea if you two fellows shook hands before you left Rugby? Goodbye, sir. Goodbye. Go on, me beauties. Goodbye! Goodbye, boys. Don't forget old Sally. Goodbye, boys. Goodbye, Sally! [LAUGHING] Another year, sir? Another year. It's a funny thing, sir. Boys come and boys go, but we goes on forever. [MUSIC PLAYING]
