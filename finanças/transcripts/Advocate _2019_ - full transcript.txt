[in Hebrew] How do we reach the detention cells? With the elevator. Is it going down? [elevator dings] -[man] Lea, what will become of you? -What do you think? When will you mend your ways? -[Lea] Who me? I'm a lost cause. -A rebel with a lost cause! -A rebel with a lost cause. -[Lea laughs] [elevator dings] [Lea muttering indistinctly] Hello, how are you? -[in Arabic] Today, we respond to the charges. -Respond? Guilty or not guilty. What we did and what we didn't do. Okay, regarding the bus driver. They say that you waited for the bus to accelerate before stabbing him, so he'd cause a crash. -Not true? -No. I won't admit to that, I'll deny that charge. -That's what I'll say? -I will, I do the talking. I respond, not you. In your name, I'm your advocate. Tell me, has your mother visited you in jail? -[man] No. -Why not? Did she contact the Red Cross [ICRC]? The only visitor I had was my 13-year-old sister. Ah. [traffic passing by] POSSESSION OF A WEAPON STONE THROWING ACCESSORY TO MURDER SUICIDE BOMBINGS CASE LAW MINORS POSSESSION OF A KNIFE [Lea] Try to get into the head of a Jewish Israeli judge in Tel Aviv. What does he think when someone gets on a bus, stabs the driver while he's driving, and then stabs 11 passengers? And then gets off and keeps stabbing them while they flee! -The fear is great. -Sure. They could sentence him to many years in prison. More than in this plea bargain. I'm the one who offered the prosecution 28 years. Hopefully, we'll close on these terms, not worse. What's this fly doing here? [slap] [all chuckle] [Lea] Oy, I didn't catch it. [woman] Do all such cases get referred to you? -Anybody who does anything? -[Lea] No, not anybody. But you like to take the tough cases? I'm not afraid to, it's not that I like to. I always see the person behind the case. -That's the important thing. -[woman] Right. [Lea] I met with your mother, I reached a plea bargain. A lot, and yet less... As such, it's a lot. But I was afraid they'd give you even more. -Understand? -Life in prison? Not life, 28 years. Now, it's a lot but... I was afraid they'd give you more. At first, they charged you with 11 attempted murders. Now, they've agreed to reduce it to one attempted murder, just the bus driver. The rest are now injurious assaults, see? [humming] [female TV host in Hebrew] My next guest is very controversial, no? So they say. Good morning, Lea Tsemel. You defend terrorists and their families. I imagined you differently, taller and tougher. I left my devil's tail at home this time. -[host] You've been called that, no? -Yeah. "Devil" and stuff like that. I've been called every name in the book. Like what? "Traitor, leftist, devil's advocate..." Does it hurt you? No, it can also be a compliment! I always took it as a compliment. -Do you have kids? -Yes. How do they live with it? We had some tough times, but... The Israeli public gradually promoted me from "devil's advocate" to "human rights lawyer," over the years. Today, it's honorable to be my children. And your husband? He too is a leftist activist. Tell you what... I think that terrorists are no different than rapists and murderers. You call them "terrorists." The average person in the world would call them "freedom fighters." Even those who... Any Palestinian who resists the occupation. You're asking: "Will you defend anyone?" Any Palestinian who commits an act, be it "conventional," be it "controversial." It makes no difference. Israelis have no right to tell the Palestinians how to struggle. It's as if you identify with them! I can't understand you. But that's okay, right? You should try to understand me because... I am the future. The political questions we're facing in Israel today, we'll face for many years to come. So if you try, you'll see I have a point. Thank you, Lea. [Lea humming] ♪ What a country ♪ ♪ What a country ♪ [humming] Yasser! [humming continues] Suheila, not like this. -Suheila. -[Suheila] What? For God's sake. I want it sorted according to prisons. -[Suheila] You said alphabetically. -No. I said alphabetically? This is alphabetical? -How is it alphabetical? -By last name. -[Lea] I asked for this? -Yes. So where's A? It starts with Z! This is page 2. Page 2 comes before page 1? -Yes. -Yes. A comes before B. Come on! And Q is certainly not... Here's A, B, C, D... -I want it sorted by prisons. -[Suheila] Get someone else to do it. [in English] I have to go. -[phone rings] -[man in Arabic] "Lea Tsemel." Ossama is speaking. [Lea] Hassan and Ahmad, that's the kid and his cousin? They're cousins. One is dead, one is injured. Who's our kid, Hassan or Ahmad? [man] We're representing Ahmad. -And Hassan is dead? -[man] Hassan is dead. "Eliminated." -[Ossama] You wanted to see the news clip, no? -[TV: theme music] Yes. -This is it? -Yes. [male newscaster in Hebrew] The wave of terror goes on: three attacks in Jerusalem left four people severely injured. Pay attention to their ages. One of the victims is only 13, one of the stabbers is also 13! [screaming, clamoring] [man] It's two kids! [female newscaster] The Pisgat Zeev neighborhood in Jerusalem, 3:00 p.m. Two terrorists armed with knives go on a stabbing spree. -[Lea] That's them? -[Ossama] Yes! [newscaster] They stab a man, causing him serious wounds. They keep going and spot a boy on his bike and wound him critically. -[Lea] Who's that? -[Ossama] The kid on the bike. [newscaster] When a civilian spots them, they flee. One terrorist is hit by a car, the other is eliminated by the police. -[Lea] That's Hassan? -[Ossama] Yes. [Lea] Oh, my God! [newscaster] The terrorists, 13 and 17, are from Arab Beit Hanina, next to Jewish Pisgat Zeev. Two neighborhoods in constant conflict. [Ossama] Now pay attention to this. This is our kid, Ahmad. [man] Die, you maniac! -[Ahmad gasping] -[man] Die, you maniac! -Die, you son of a bitch! -[woman wails] [man] Die, you son of a bitch! Die, you motherfucker! Die, son of a bitch. Die! -Motherfucker! -[officer] Move away. -[man] Murder him! -[officer] Move away! [man] Put a bullet in his head. Come on, a bullet in the head! They shot the other one. [scoffs] [clamoring fades] [Ossama] Their fathers are coming now. -[in Arabic] You're the father of... -[man] Hassan. You're Hassan's father? -You're Ahmad's father? -Yes. How old was Hassan? -[Hassan's father] Hassan was 15 years old. -Fifteen? -[Hassan's father] He just turned 15. -Let me note this. Wow, I didn't realize... I thought he was older! When they said the little one was only 13, everyone assumed the bigger one was older. Did the police tell you that he was dead? During my interrogation, they told me to go out to the yard. There was an ambulance there. They took out a corpse, unzipped the nylon bag, and I saw my son Hassan. -You saw it was him. -I saw my son was dead. You identified his body. Okay. And you didn't undergo any interrogations? [Ahmad's father] No, I haven't seen my son to this day. -They just asked me about the knife. -[Lea] Just that specific knife? Describe it. [Ahmad's father] Like a Rambo knife, with a serrated blade. You use it to slaughter sheep? [Ahmad's father] No, it's a decoration. -Ah. Just for display? -[Ahmad's father] Yes. I kept it in a safe place, even though it's not sharp. -Not sharp? -[Ahmad's father] Right, it isn't sharp. You looked but didn't find it? [Ahmad's father] It wasn't there. Okay... Detention of a minor. Let's hope there's no press! [clamoring] [man in Hebrew] Go ahead, Lea. Where's the kid? [man] Here he comes! He's coming, he's coming! -[shutters clicking] -Where is he? [reporter] Did you catch his smile? [Lea] He's crying, not smiling. -[reporter] Cute smile. -[Lea] He's crying! -[man] Got him? -[man 2] Got him good. [reporter] Cutie. I got him smiling! You name it, I got it. [reporter 2] Strong like a bull. [man] Wow. [shutters clicking] [reporter] Lea, Lea, Lea! Come! It's the kid's father. [in Arabic] When he saw me, he said: -"You don't love me." -What? "You don't love me." I asked: "Why?" He said: "You're a Jew, and the Jews don't love me." I said: "Try me." He's the youngest kid in detention. He seems like a nice boy. Here's Atty. Tareq Barghout. He represents the Palestinian Prisoners Office, in Ramallah. We need to consult. I talked with the kid. -He's cute. -Very cute. And he says he didn't stab. They talked about stabbing a man. But not children or women, nothing like that. Question is... I was just reading the Youth Law. "Detention of a minor before indictment... Article 17 stipulates that..." Come on! "The detention of a minor after indictment... The article doesn't apply to minors under age 14." [Lea in Hebrew] The kid complained about the way he's being interrogated, and the treatment he's receiving, including in the courthouse cells. He's being beaten, threatened and humiliated. -[man] Why did he have a knife? -[Tareq] What? [man] If he didn't intend to stab, why did he have a knife? We're not saying he didn't intend to stab, we're saying he didn't partake in the stabbing. Don't forget he's a 13-year-old boy who still can't tell right from wrong, which is why the law stipulates that minors under 14 cannot be imprisoned. -[man] Your name? -Tareq Barghout. -[man] And? -Lea Tsemel, Advocate. -[Tareq] Thank you! -[Lea] Thank you. Good job, guys! [male newscaster] The kid entered the remand hearing with a faint smile on his face. The Jerusalem Magistrate's Court extended his detention. His lawyers are claiming he didn't stab. "Maybe he intended to stab, but he's not a 'terrorist'." Someone wrote: "The media blurred his face. Way to protect the human rights of somebody devoid of humanity." -[phone rings] -[man on phone] Lea, how are you? Fine. Josh Breiner from Walla News. -Hi. -Hi. How did it go in court today, with the kid? [sighs] I don't know, it's the first time I've seen him. Have you ever had a case like this? Thirteen? No. Never. In June 1967, I was a law student. Suddenly, one morning, shells started exploding. Scary, super scary. They asked who among the students wants to volunteer. And I volunteered. I remember the war was still raging, but the Old City had been conquered. So I snuck into the Old City with another volunteer, and went to the Wailing Wall. Kids in the street yelled: "Moshe Dayan, Moshe Dayan!" It was a tiny, narrow alley. We took pictures with the soldiers. Later, I heard I was the first Israeli woman at the Wailing Wall. It was a very special moment. But all this wonder and euphoria had to do with the feeling that now there could be some "togetherness." It was a "War for Peace." In my naiïveté, I totally believed it. It didn't last long. As soon as the war ended, they took the volunteers to tour the Occupied Territories. On the road from Jerusalem, I saw people heading down toward Jericho. Lines of people going into exile. It reminded me of a picture I grew up with at home. It was called: "The Wandering Jew." My mother immigrated from Europe in 1933. She later managed to bring her parents, just before the Holocaust. The rest of the family was annihilated. It's part of our family load. I'm from Haifa, a mixed Arab-Jewish city. I grew up in an Arab-owned house, I was born in 1945. In 1948, they fled and weren't allowed to return. 1948, how could we have done that? What happened to those refugees? And now there are new refugees! When I went to the Wailing Wall, it was just a narrow alley with a handful of soldiers. Soon after, they demolished the houses around the Wailing Wall. When I went back, the neighborhood was gone! I asked: "What about the people who lived here?" The kids who yelled: "Moshe Dayan" were from there! I needed answers. In the university in those days, there was a group of "weirdos" who hung out on campus and had things to say. "Guys, they fooled us, it's all a bluff! It's not land without people for a people without a land." "There were people here!" I was very ambivalent. I said: "Matzpen and its politics aren't for me. I come from a Zionist home, like everyone else!" But I was drawn to them because they had answers to my questions. And I made my choice, I joined Matzpen. From that moment on, I never looked back. [man] We met at the Hebrew University. I was still a religious boy in religious attire. One day, I saw some commotion. A brawl on the Hebrew University lawn. People were tearing up a flyer that was being distributed by a group called "Matzpen." Where's your national pride? Look me in the eyes, fellow Jews! Look me in the eyes, girl! You who will soon be the mother of children! [man] But in the middle of this mess, I spot a short little woman. Beautiful. Fashionably dressed in an extra short skirt, with extra high boots. Waving around a metal chain with tons of keys, like a prison warden. To this day, she has tons of keys. God knows what they open. And using expressions I'd never even heard, let alone said. Curses... "Ah, you want to fuck me, with that little dick?" I stood there speechless. So I asked someone: "Who's that?" "Don't you know? Lea Tsemel!" I joined Matzpen soon after. Maybe for her legs... I don't know if it was for the ideology, or her legs. But I joined. A year and a half later, we were a couple. [Lea mutters] "Conspiracy to commit a crime..." This one and this one. PRECEDENTS, ATTEMPTED MURDER [grunts] Here, three months of community service for a Jewish man who attacked an Arab woman and her children. We don't want attacks, we want stabbings and knives... -Look for knives! -[Lea] So what? He beat her with a plank of wood! Who cares if it's a knife? -A shooting, isn't it better? -[Tareq] Sure, it's better. [Lea] Voilà! We have shootings. Now let's look at the... -Official video of the... -[Lea] Government Press Office. [Benjamin Netanyahu on video] First, he isn't dead. He's alive! Second, he isn't naive. Third, he isn't innocent. He tried to murder a 13-year-old boy. [Tareq] He pronounced him guilty before he was even interrogated. [Netanyahu] This lie, which together with all the other lies forms one big... [Tareq] One big lie. Is to tell the truth. We reject the false symmetry between Israelis under attack -and the terrorists who attack them. -[Lea groans] [Tareq] Even the internet doesn't want to hear him. [in English] ...is the result of continuous Palestinian incitement... [Tareq scoffs] Yesterday, President Mahmoud Abbas, accused Israel of putting to death, executing, an innocent Palestinian boy. First of all, he's not dead, he's alive. Second, he's not innocent. He tried to kill! Murder! -Thank you very much. -[Abbas in Arabic] Our homes, and our lands, and our children, killed in cold blood. Like they did to this child, Ahmad #*#*#*#* and other kids in Jerusalem and the Palestinian territories. Abu Mazen said that as far as he knows, the kid died. He's right, a kid died! A 15-year-old. [Tareq] Yeah, he waved a picture of the wrong kid. He wasn't mistaken about the result. He got the name wrong. [Tareq] He got the name wrong, but the other one lied. That's the occupation. [Lea] And when a Jew comes along and does something similar... [Tareq] But that's what happened! In Pisgat Zeev, the same neighborhood, there was a "lynch" against Arabs. Two Arab minors were attacked by dozens of Jews. Those attackers weren't charged with attempted murder. [Tareq] But factually speaking it's similar! But they were charged with injurious assault! That's how the authorities set a discriminatory double standard without openly saying: "These charges apply to Arabs only." Did you get confirmation that the knife was clean? -Yes. -It's confirmed? Yes, there were no DNA findings. -Meaning there wasn't... -[Lea] No blood on his knife. His knife was clean. -Can I enter? -It's forbidden. The judge won't allow it. -Before the judge enters... -No way. I don't mess around with judges. -I'm her intern. -Me too. You're an intern? Show me your card. His family is here... -Can I enter? -Hang on. Move away from the door, when you can enter, you will. Everything's under control. We explained to the judge that we have a big problem in human terms. If we plead guilty to two attempted murders, maybe the court will rule before his 14th birthday, and maybe he won't go to prison, but rather six years in a juvenile center. -A closed facility. -A center for delinquent youth. But the judge said: "I understand the problem. I understand the conflict, the contradiction. Even if you admit to two attempted murders," said the judge, "I'll bring the kid before me. I'll ask him: 'Do you plead guilty?' And if he doesn't say: 'Yes, my intent was to murder!' I won't accept his plea. We'll go to trial." -But his intent wasn't to murder. -That's right. If he didn't intend to kill, why should we say he did? We're taking a chance. It's risky. But I believe we have to take the chance. Because his conscience, your conscience, and ours, are more important than what will come. That's what I think. And no one can guarantee what is to come. [reporter] The hearing just ended. This case entails one of the worst conflicts in the criminal justice system. And one of the worst conflicts I've encountered in my long career. Do we take advantage of the fact that he's under age 14, and expedite legal proceedings, before he can be sent to prison? But doing so would require him to admit to two attempted murders. Despite the fact that this kid is sticking to his version: "I had no intent to murder anyone." So even if we stand to gain something by pleading guilty to attempted murder, if he won't do it, I can't do it for him and the court won't accept a false admission. But he could pay a heavy price for that position. It's always heavy. Today, Palestinian TV aired a clip from the interrogation of Ahmad #*#*#*#*, who was involved in the stabbing attack in Pisgat Zeev, in which a 13-year-old Jewish kid was stabbed. Let's watch. -[interrogator] Look! -[Ahmad] I really don't... [interrogator] What do you mean "really"? You little liar! -Why did you stab him? -[Ahmad sputters] [interrogator] Why did you stab him? I don't... I'm asking why you stabbed him! -I don't know! -Why did you stab him? I don't remember! [sobbing] I don't remember, I'm going mad! -I don't remember, take me to a doctor! -Why did you stab him? -I don't remember! -[interrogator] Stop it! Put your hands down! Sit up straight! Why did you stab him with a knife? Hands down! Why did you stab him? [Ahmad] I can't remember, I'm losing my mind! -Why did you stab him? -I don't remember! I asked you, Ahmad, why did you stab him? I really don't remember. I really can't remember a thing. I see the surveillance footage and don't remember anything. [newscaster] The 13-year-old who stabbed another 13-year-old... The interrogation of a kid with a cracked skull. [Michel] 1972, was two things. It's the year that Nissan, our elder child, was born. And it's Lea's entry into political trials. In fact, her very first trial was the Arab-Jewish underground. It's a story that's hard to imagine today. Israeli Jews dared to join an Arab national movement. It was like an atomic bomb had fallen on Israel. [newscaster] The defendants are accused of grave charges like aiding the enemy in war. On the docket: Daoud Turki is accused of recruiting the group's members. He's the one who brought Jews into the fold. Udi Adiv, according to the charges, revealed classified information about the IDF paratrooper unit in which he'd served. [Lea] Udi was a comrade and one day, out of the blue, he was arrested. As a member of a Jewish-Arab underground group that went to Syria. We too were shocked. Ties with Arabs? Of course! Even with Arabs across the border. But ideological ties! Not "espionage," of which he was accused. LONG LIVE JOINT ARAB-JEWISH STRUGGLE [Michel] One must understand the context. The national consensus is total. We're only five years past 1967, and Israel's still euphoric. There was only one group, "Matzpen," and later the underground, that took things a step further, that communicated the opposite message. Today, that message is trivial: "There's an occupation, there are Palestinians, they have rights." It sounds banal. Back then, it sounded revolutionary. [Udi Adiv] What I intended to do, and all I intended to do, is a revolution. For the sake of both Jews and Arabs in this land. I never thought... -[judge] Did you intend to aid the enemy? -Absolutely not. [Lea] And he was depicted as a monster. I went to defend the monster and his friends. I went to defend Jewish-Arab cooperation, for the sake of a better future. I refused to throw the baby out with the bath water, to let them consider cooperation invalid. LOST REVOLUTIONARIES IDEOLOGICAL ENEMIES COURT IS NOT A POLITICAL STAGE JUDGES DENY CLAIMS OF TORTURE [newscaster] Today's hearing was devoted to the defendant's claims that his eight confessions were extracted with coercion, beatings and threats. I told my interrogator: "It seems you want to eliminate me. You're threatening me by saying you've eliminated people before. So just eliminate me! Why torture, question, intimidate?" He said: "No! Don't think we'll kill you all at once. We'll kill you a thousand times. And you'll leave this place a mad man." [Lea] It was one after another, always the same. They all described the shackling, sleep deprivation, deafening music, interrogations day and night, and the beatings. It clearly wasn't the whim of a sole interrogator, it was systematic. There were instructions, like a user manual. How to cause the human body pain and suffering. How to cause pain and suffering, without leaving marks. How to cause the human body pain and suffering, so that... the detainee remains conscious and keeps answering questions. [judge] We have no doubt that the defendant's claims about torture, are the figment of his imagination, and we do not believe him. We're convinced he confessed of his own free will, and we approve them as evidence in this trial. [Lea] The confession is the "queen of evidence," and they'll do anything to get it. With a confession, be it true or false, his fate is sealed. TURKI AND ADIV SENTENCED TO 17 YEARS ADVOCATE TSEMEL IDENTIFIES WITH THE ENEMIES OF THE STATE Two things happened in 1972, Nini's birth and the trial. I'd say the trial symbolized Nini's life, from that day on. He became secondary to her total devotion to the defense of political prisoners. One day, we were walking together. That didn't happen often. I guess she had the afternoon off. A man passes us on the street. "Are you Lea Tsemel?" She says: "Who's asking?" With concern in her voice. He opens his jacket, points at a gun, and explains that they know who she is, and she should watch out. She responds with a juicy curse, that he doesn't scare her, and that their threats only make her stronger. He keeps walking and so do we. I asked: "Why do you have to do this work? It's not fun for me!" And she said: "I can't do anything else. I believe in it." What? You're out of your mind. Unbelievable. Traffic schmaffic, come on! You have a meeting in Ramallah. Quit the nonsense and come to the office now! When? No! It doesn't work like that! How will you get to court by 8:30? Tareq... What's his name... Yasser! Yasser! Yasser! These are leading precedents in juvenile cases. Review them to see what's relevant to our case. Not during work hours! Ossama, come here a minute. I wanted to talk to Tareq, but he's a no-show. In any event, where's the accused? Without parental presence, from the first interrogation. "I didn't stab..." "I tossed the knife..." "Why did you want to be a martyr?" "I have the right to remain silent. I'll tell you: because you shoot war missiles at the kids in Gaza. You destroy their homes, poor kids." "So you wanted to kill Jews because the Jews kill you. You wanted to avenge the deaths of Muslims." "No! Just to scare them so they'll stop killing us." He doesn't admit to wanting to kill. Oy, oy, oy... This is his final confession, his words are very clear. I'm sure of my decision on how to plea. It's hard to convince the masses, but I'm sure. Who do you represent? I represent the stabbing victims. [reporter] Do you know for a fact that Ahmad took part in the stabbing? Or was he just part of the incident? -That's our opinion. -[reporter] That? That Ahmad was part of the incident, and can't be separated from it. But he didn't stab anyone. We're not discussing the charges, as per the court's orders. Now you pissed me off! Okay. Now I'm going to talk! [lawyer] Show me how it's done. [man] Lea, stand in the middle. Where's the middle? -[woman] Lea, move this way. -[Lea] 1,2,3... The charges against this boy... Where's my co-counsel? Where's Tareq? Tareq! -Should I call him? -Yes. -[woman] It's not nice to yell. -Who cares! -Enough, enough! -[man] You're covering her face! Okay. I don't want this one. The indictment charges this minor, boy under the imprisonable age, with two counts of attempted murder. None of his confessions mention intent to murder, to the contrary! He was asked if he intended to murder, and his unequivocal response was: "No!" He states in all his interrogations, even under extreme duress, that he and his cousin agreed from the outset not to hurt women, children or the elderly. And when he saw his cousin eyeing the kid on the bike, he said: "Haram, he's just a kid!" Meaning: "It's forbidden." "He's a boy, don't hurt him." The indictment, more or less describes what indeed took place. Save for the attribution of intent! The intent to murder, the intent to cause death. There the indictment is wrong and completely baseless. [reporter] Lea, if you aren't pleading guilty, to avoid a prison term due to his age, what's your game plan? We're putting our trust in the court's veracity and integrity. Both justice and the law warrant them, and we'll obtain them. [in Arabic] You have all my respect! -[Lea] It's been many years. -Hat's off to you! Thank you so much. You're one of a kind! I've known her for 30 years! So? -What? -[man] You're mistaken. -You should have pleaded guilty. -Are you crazy? Who's to say when they'll convict? Convict? Nonsense, there's no basis. You wanna bet? Abraham, Isaac, Jacob. -[crowd clamoring] -[woman] This is a terrorist court! This is a racist court! Children of Palestine! Ahmad, Ahmad... Children of Palestine! Death to the murderers! Death to the murderers! The defendants entered the courtroom one after another. [newscaster] In front of the cameras, they act confident and wave to their relatives. They are accused of killing six Jews in the Beit Hadassah settlement in Hebron, and injuring 16 others. The defendants chose to make political statements, claiming they're soldiers who aren't fighting the Jews as such, but rather defending their lands and homes. Defense attorney Nasser Darwish argued that this military court doesn't have the authority to prosecute the defendants, seeing as they are "prisoners of war." That was the line of defense advanced by Attorney Lea Tsemel. [Lea] The Beit Hadassah trial was exceptional. It was one of the first times a settlement was attacked, hitting its symbolic heart, Beit Hadassah in Hebron. A well-trained group of fighters tried and succeeded to carry out their aim. They were a very political group. They demanded to be recognized as combatants who waged a legitimate war against an illegitimate occupation, and thus are unwilling to be judged by the occupation's court. It's rare for a lawyer to encounter a client who is willing to stick to his principles and doesn't sell out. It's an honor to stand beside him, without mounting a defense. [newscaster] "The defendants are beasts," said the judges, "devoid of humanity. It was premeditated, cold-blooded murder. It must be retributed harshly. Their crime is punishable by death. However, these terrorists will be sentenced to life in prison." The reaction could be heard outside. [crowd] Death to the murderers! Death to the murderers! [interviewer] Why aren't you in the footage, when you were the leading lawyer on the case? [Lea chuckles] There were many journalists and the mood was extra hostile. I didn't want to enter the courtroom and catch hell in front of the press, and let them document the yelling and cursing. It's an image that I don't want anyone to see. Even though they managed to capture them spitting on me, but nothing more. I was pregnant, and I had to pass through them. And one of them said: "May you give birth to a monster!" It stuck with me, that curse. I didn't give birth to a monster, far from it! But the curse, the spell he put on me, angered me. It infuriated me. People ask me if I'm afraid to walk around in the world, in Israel, in Jerusalem, as her daughter. My feeling is just the opposite. It's as if by being on the front lines... she protects me too. As if I have merit points, that I didn't earn, but belong to me too. [in Arabic] "I'm Lea Tsemel's daughter!" [in Hebrew] My friends and family, my husband too, all know that if in trouble, yell: "I'm Lea Tsemel's daughter," no matter the trouble. It's like a magic spell that will save us. I totally believe in the spell. [interviewer] Does she have red lines? I don't think so. [chuckles] [Lea] When I ask myself about red lines, I ask it in reverse. I don't have a moral conflict with saying: "Yes," but with saying: "No." That's my contemplation, when am I allowed to say: "No"? So I set the following "framework" for myself: I'm an Israeli occupier, no matter what I do. I "enjoy" the fruits of occupation, both bitter and sweet. And I didn't manage, despite my moral obligation as an Israeli, to change the regime and its policies. On what moral grounds should I judge the people who resist my occupation? And hand out grades: "That's good, that's bad." If you're a non-violent demonstrator and they shoot you dead, you're good. But if you have a knife and they shoot you dead, you're bad. Who gave me that right? So, in that sense, if the act is intended to resist the occupation, as such, I'll take it on. [in Arabic] There is no God but Allah! There is no God but Allah. It'll be okay. Come on, I have two hearings beforehand. -[Tareq] Now? -[Lea] Yes! I have a stomach ache because of the hearing. I haven't felt like this in a long time. -Yours doesn't hurt? -No! I'm ready for battle, as they say. Where do you want to talk to him? I wouldn't mind sitting on that bench over there. [indistinct chatter] I'm going to read your own words back to you. The same exact words you spoke when you withstood police interrogation, when those nasty interrogators screamed at you. If you're clever here too, the court will love you. They'll love you, okay? And I will too. -Come sit, Tareq. -[Tareq] No. So you can talk to him too. [Lea] "What was your aim?" Let's talk about your aim. They asked: "What did you want to do to the Jews?" -What did you answer? -[Ahmad] Scare them. "Nothing but scare them." I'm reading your own words, if you don't understand, he can read. Who do you prefer? Whose Arabic is better? -[all chuckle] -Okay, read it to him word for word. [Tareq] "We weren't... I didn't stab anyone..." [Ahmad] She reads better! [Lea] I knew he'd say that! [Tareq] "We went to stab Jews, but I didn't stab anyone." "Why?" "Because I was scared." [Lea] He tried to make you say you're against the Jews, but you didn't fall for it, because it's not true. -[woman 1] Muhammad? -[woman 2] Ahmad! No! -[Lea] He's shy! -Don't be shy! I'm also like your mother! All Palestinian mothers are mothers to you. [laughs] How are you, Ahmad? We're all your mothers. Not just your own mother. All Palestinian women are your mothers! Every martyr's mother, every prisoner's mother... Girls, girls! Take it easy. He has an important task ahead, testimony, let him concentrate. THE HEARING IS HELD BEHIND CLOSED DOORS -[Lea] Don't tell me to consult. -[Tareq] Consult! -I told you we have to show them that... -[Lea] What? That the entire country rallied against this kid! -[Lea] Why are you mad at me? -I'm not mad. -[Lea] Be honest, tell me. -I'm not mad. What disappointed you? I'm disappointed that when I proceeded with the right tactic, you didn't listen to me, so I stopped. But when the judges told you: "Do it this way," you listened. We have to be on the same page, next time. We have to be in sync. Otherwise, they'll say: "The best lawyers around, just because of their differences of opinion..." They'd say that? You don't understand. People will say worse than that. -But the kid did fine. -He was fine. I was a bit dry, you would've added more sauce, no? -Yeah. -"What did you feel..." Let the prosecutor ask him. Hey kid! When the judge saw the knife, she went: "Wow!" -[Lea] It's a toy knife. -It's a murderous knife! Come on! I can buy ten knives like it in a souvenir shop in Spain. You don't slaughter sheep with a knife like that. [Tareq] No, maybe you stab sheep with it... [all laugh] Come on. [Ossama] Lea... Why didn't you raise the claim that when he was interrogated... That he just wanted it to end? -Yeah! -No! You want to claim that he lied due to trepidation and torture... But he didn't tell any lies! -Everything he said was true! -But no... Like today, he said: "If they had tried to kill me, I would've stabbed them." Yes, and he means it! Whatever he says is true! That's what's so brilliant about his testimony. This boy speaks the truth, and the truth can't be altered. That's why the scary prosecutor doesn't scare him. The interrogator doesn't coerce him into changing his mind. Because he sticks to the truth! How do you know when someone's telling the truth? When they don't change their mind, this way or that. Now, it happens in interrogations that people make false confessions, because of dread, fear, horror. Had he lied, contesting his confession would be relevant, but it's not! And our advantage vis-a-vis the judges is to say: "This is his version and he's sticking to it." No matter how much they yell at him, manipulate him, put words in his mouth. When they call it "martyrdom," it's their wording. Whatever they try, he doesn't change his story. He's as consistent as can be, that's what's great about him. Why say he admitted out of fear? Why should I say that he lied just to end the interrogation? Look, a broomstick! I've never seen a ruling that reads: "Oh! It seems he was fed up with being interrogated, so he told lies to end it." "I Can't Understand the Parisians," it's a song by Maurice Chevalier. If you ask me. ♪ I can't understand The Parisians ♪ ♪ Making love Every time they... ♪ No, thanks. [in English] Pure butter! [in Arabic] Here's why Tareq and I thought we should talk. We still don't know what'll happen. We have a meeting scheduled with the prosecution. We don't know what they'll say. If they want to make an example of Ahmad, to teach all the other kids a lesson. Tareq prefers to know the outcome, he doesn't want to take any chances. We'll meet the prosecution but need to know what message to deliver. We are your messengers. Don't say: "We want the best outcome!" We'll aim for the best outcome. But if we don't succeed, what will you find acceptable? The prosecutor told us: "If you change your plea and admit to two attempted murders today, we'll ask for six years." No, the boy didn't intend to kill, and you know it! [Lea] I know! But the prosecutor is talking about six years. If we plead guilty, he'll agree to close on six. -[Ahmad's father] No, six is too much. -I agree. -As a mother, I want my son... -I want him back too. I can't even imagine one to two years. Yesterday, I cried a river. There's no guarantee regarding the outcome, do you understand? But if the term is the same, where do you prefer him to do time? He's better off in juvenile detention. Okay, it's important for me to hear that from you. -Okay, thank you. -Take care, dear. Well, at least they're not into the heroic "big prison" narrative. Not at all. [dogs barking] [Lea in English] You know, the two prisoners were killed. I say "killed," because me and the families, we see the prison authorities totally responsible for their deaths. FREEDOM FOR POLITICAL PRISONERS FREEDOM FOR THE HUNGER STRIKERS They were force-fed. Whatever they were given, which was very salty. Like the prisoners said, "the water of the Dead Sea," was given, by mistake, into the lungs instead of into the stomach. That's the reason that we see them responsible. [in Hebrew] Being someone's lawyer entails more than just appearing in court and arguing their case passionately. It means being there for them in their daily life. Especially if they're sentenced to prison for political reasons. Given the miserable prison conditions, I couldn't just say: "Case closed," and drop the client. But in addition to political prisoners, there's the oppression of Palestinians: freedom of speech, freedom of the press. The suppression of student protests. It was all part of my daily workload, beyond the hardcore cases involving armed resistance. Israeli policy in the Occupied Territories is one of repression, dispossession and confiscation. Palestinians under occupation have no civil rights. Youth in the Occupied Territories are the most active in responding politically to current events. [students chanting] [in English] I know for sure that this year, the students definitely were planning on studying. And they were saying that they kept trying to get to the university to work and they were being hampered by the military. [in Hebrew] Political leaders, people with leadership potential, with the ability to influence, are regularly detained. [woman in English] And I was arrested, I was looking for a lawyer. And from that day on, Lea was really part of our experience of struggle at Birzeit University. During all these closures, during all these military incursions, the shootings, the arrests, and so on... It was Lea who was there all the time. [students chanting] Open Birzeit! Open Birzeit! [woman] To us, being a prisoner is a fact of life. Every home, every family, has had at least one prisoner, if not more. Many families have had "martyrs." Many families have had people deported. Many families have had their homes destroyed. But every family can tell you: "I have prisoners in my midst. The Israelis reached into my home and extracted my son, my daughter, my husband, my brother, and took him or her away." And it was Lea who was there saying: "I will try to bring him or her back." Lea went to court, to help our students, and I was nursing, I was breastfeeding Zeina, and Talila got hungry, so I breastfed her as well. And so now, they're milk sisters. You see, in our tradition, when two babies are fed the same mother's milk, they become sisters. And this is a very strong bond. [Lea] I really don't feel the gap of a Palestinian, a Jew. I don't think we ever had it between us. [woman] She was very human. She was the only one, really, who recognized us in the Greek sense of anagnorisis. You know, I recognize your humanity and what you're going through. If you are fighting against injustice, and you don't have any other tools, you adopt the tools that are available, you manufacture your own tools. Some people turn their bodies into tools. They don't have war planes or tanks, they have bodies. It doesn't mean she condoned this or she thought it was right, but she said you have to understand it in the context in which this happened. This is a very difficult and rare situation. Where you could look at the victim-cum-violent-person, and understand the motives for violence and understand that this is a response to a greater form of violence. You are not abstract labeled "terrorists." [TV: news theme music] [newscaster in Hebrew] An escalation in the current wave of terror. A female terrorist blew up in her car at a checkpoint. Israa Jaabis, a 31-year-old resident of East Jerusalem, had intended to blow up her car in the city center. The policeman she injured... [newscaster 2 in Arabic] The occupation, as usual, is accusing Israa Jaabis of attempting to murder a policeman, after she was severely burned when her car exploded accidentally. [reporter] Are you suffering from the pain, Israa? [Israa] What do you think? My pain is visible. [reporter] What about your fingers, your hands? [Israa] I don't have fingers anymore. [Lea] Welcome, Jaabis! Should I take this case? -Hello. -[Lea] Hello, how are you? Cold. I want to know what Israa's chances are in her case. [Lea] I haven't studied her file yet. I can't say, I don't know anything yet. [woman] She's innocent, nothing they're claiming about her is accurate. [Lea] Why do you think she's innocent? Tell me. Because she's not a person who'd do this sort of thing. I need to read the file, to smell it. To know what it's telling us. Then we'll talk. You're telling me what you think, no problem. But I still don't know what the file is telling us. You're familiar with the charges? "The accused, as detailed below, woke up at 4:30 in the morning to pray with her husband. Then she took butane tanks from her husband's house and a lighter, put them in the backseat of her car, and drove by herself to Jerusalem to blow up the butane tanks and kill as many Jewish civilians and security personnel as she could." Is her husband religious? [woman] He prays, yes. [Lea] How did they meet? He's family? [woman 2] Yeah, he's a relative. But the thing is that Israa didn't want to stay with him. [Lea] Bye. Hello! Turn off the heaters before you go, okay? I'm outta here. What terrible fatigue. [yawns] [interviewer] I wasn't sure you'd take the case. -The woman's? -Yes. I already said yes. No, it's not easy, but she needs help. Such hard cases. [interviewer] Harder than they used to be? No, cases like these are always hard, but they're very hard. People who choose to kill themselves, by way of the police. "Suicide by cop," it's called. Instead of killing themselves on their own, they'll do something that will bring a "respectable" death upon them. It seems there were two suicide attempts in her past that didn't succeed. Was it a suicide bombing, or not? It's not clear-cut. But she clearly wanted to die. ♪ I'm crazy about her ♪ ♪ I'm crazy about her ♪ [chains clinking] Do you look the most like Israa? -Who does? -No, Mona does. -Mona, tell her... -I'm not as pretty as Israa. In her condition, she clearly should be under house arrest. -Get real, where do you live? -In Israel. -Exactly! You should know better. -No one died, no one died! She's the one who got hurt, no? It's different when someone is killed. When someone is killed, you get life in prison. That's what I'm saying, she only hurt herself. -You're right. -Just herself. [woman] She doesn't want her picture taken! I'll file a complaint against any media outlet that publishes it! I have no problem if you interview me. But you don't have permission to film her in this condition. She doesn't want the world to see her this way. Respect it! [Lea] Tareq, the cigarette can wait! [Tareq] No, it can't. -They're starting the hearing now. -Give me one minute. [Lea] With no will power, they'll break you in interrogation. When I went in, the judges said: "Work out a plea bargain! At least agree on the punishment, what's the problem? Agree on the charges, on the sentence." Then the prosecutor demanded to know: "Might he be acquitted of attempted murder?" Because they have to prove intent. "What intent must we prove?" he said. "With a knife this big, what intent must we prove?" They still have to prove intent, given that the boy insists that it was only meant to... frighten. The knife has to be scary if you want to scare people. If you want to kill, you can do it with... A razor! We've got a precedent. Jews who killed an Arab, just because he's Arab. They found someone whom they were sure was an Arab. They slit his throat with a razor, from ear to ear, and he died. They were charged with manslaughter, not premeditated murder. So... To scare people, you need a big knife. To kill people, there are other ways. Plenty of ways. The judges said: "Why don't you reach a plea bargain?" -The judges? -The judges. But we don't want a bad plea bargain, right? -We don't want a bad deal. -No. -Lea, I brought you Mentos. -Thank you! Thank you, thank you. Please, have some. [newscaster] In three days, Ahmad will turn 14. But it won't be a regular birthday. [Ossama] In the media, he's a sensation. "The child prisoner." Be it adult prison or juvenile lockup, either way people will say: "He's doing time." Like Ahmad said, if he goes to prison, he'll be recruited by Hamas or Fatah. And you can be sure that when he's released, he'll commit another act. They'll convince him by telling him: "When you were little you had a big name, so now continue." [Lea] In our meetings with the prosecution, we proposed to scale the punishment. A number of years in adult prison, or double the time in youth lockup. [Ossama] Will the prosecution agree to it? I don't know. Tareq thinks there's no justice to be found in court. We always face the same conflict, I don't have unequivocal answers. I can't tell Tareq he's wrong, because he might not be. It's quite possible he's right. He prefers to minimize the risks, and the risks do exist. I told him he can say: "It's Lea's fault." I couldn't in good conscience contribute to the image of a Palestinian boy as bloodthirsty. The image of a beast. That's not what he is. If he had it in him, maybe. But he doesn't. Lea, let's think about it this way. If two Jewish settlers went to an Arab village, with the same knives, one of them stabs, and the other doesn't. You'd also attribute "attempted murder" to them. [Lea] I would! But the prosecution wouldn't. [laughs] The prosecution simply wouldn't. -[Ossama] Okay. -I'm telling you the prosecution wouldn't! We have a precedent where settlers used guns, not knives! They used guns. Maybe I've been wrong all along, what can I say? Could be. [female newscaster] The special investigations unit of the Israeli police shut down the Alternative Information Center [AIC], and arrested its director, Michel Warschawski. I intend to say one thing in my interrogation: we're being accused of ties to the PFLP, it never happened! Quit pretending! [male newscaster] The arrest of Michel Warschawski, director of the Alternative Information Center, comes after extensive intelligence gathering that was presented to the chief of police. The police discovered that, allegedly, among other things, the AIC prints and publishes unlawful texts authored by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. This information was disseminated on behalf of the terrorist group. [Lea] When he was arrested, I realized that although I'm used to jails, prisons and interrogations, it's not the same when it's your own flesh and blood. WHY DID THEY ARREST LEA TSEMEL'S HUSBAND? [Michel] I was interrogated intensively in what's known in Jerusalem as "Cell 20," which is the secret service section. On the second day, along came an interrogator known as "Judah," and he started barking and yelling. The next day I said to Lea: "Get me out of here!" "What? You're afraid of that good-for-nothing? He interrogated Udi Adiv in 1973. Now it's 1987, and he still has the same job, ordering Arabs to get on all fours and bray like donkeys? You're afraid of an idiot who never got promoted? You're not worthy of being my husband." It was a kick in the face, that helped a lot. "You're not worthy of being my husband." It gave me... Strength. I thought: "If I'm tough on him, he'll toughen up too." I don't know if he remembers... It was... Obviously, I had to be tough on him. Mm-hmm. To convey my expectations, which he met. At a certain point in my interrogation, the interrogator said: "You've been active for years, cursing the state, and we never interfered, do you know why? Because we live in a democracy. But over there," he pointed toward the East, "there's no democracy there, over there, it's occupation. And with the AIC, we have a problem, your position is unclear. Are you here or there?" I said: "We're both!" He said: "Wrong answer. It's too complicated for us. It's the gray area. If you promise to cut your ties with the Palestinian side, you're free, and the AIC can do whatever it wants. But if you maintain ties with Palestinians, we'll treat you like Palestinians." So after another weekend, all alone in "Cell 20," I had enough self-respect, I wouldn't call it courage, that when he asked me: "Did you think about it?" I said: "I like the gray area." Shame. The lead story on the nightly news. The father has been arrested, in front of everybody in Israel, and is suspected of... treason. I repress it. I have a little sister, four, five years old, and I have to pretend everything's okay. I didn't attend the trial or his remand hearing. Even the day he was released from prison, I pretended to be asleep, because I couldn't face anybody. If I saw his character in a documentary, I'd say: "Wow! What courage and conviction!" It's not about agreeing with the politics. It's betting on your life and saying: "There's something more important." Children and family are secondary. To see a man who believes in his way, it moves me. Yes. In the end, he was convicted of the one charge I was willing to admit to in my initial plea bargain offer. That in the AIC, without his knowledge, a booklet was being printed on ways to withstand torture in interrogation. How to survive secret service custody. Apparently, the booklet was very threatening to the secret service. "You can't reveal our methods! Don't teach them," the booklet was in Arabic, "what we're allowed or forbidden to do." Since he didn't know what was in the booklet, but could have known had he made an effort, he was found guilty of willful blindness. That was the only conviction. [Michel] That was the good news. The bad news was that for each acquittal, 30 out 31, they gave me a month in prison. Lea isn't to blame for the sentence, she's to be credited for the acquittals. I'd wish it upon anyone to have Lea as a lawyer. But I don't recommend being both her partner and her client. Know what it's like to share a bed, with a 800-page legal file between us? [male newscaster] The Jerusalem District Court will deliver the verdict today of the 13-year-old terrorist who stabbed and injured two young Jews in Pisgat Zeev. [Lea hums] The colorful one is prettier. Okay. Shall we? I'm really into this one. Let's see. I can wear them both! [laughs] [male newscaster] The court convicted the 14-year-old boy of two attempted murders and possession of a knife. In a month, his punishment proceedings will be held, wherein the prosecution will demand that he go to prison for years. [Lea] There was no attempted murder, nor intent to murder! [prosecutor] We received the verdict today. I heard the miserable statements of advocate Lea Tsemel. A shameful attempt to confuse... [Lea] You're talking about me? Between the victim and the loathsome murderer. -[Lea] The loathsome murderer? -[prosecutor] Who tried to take a child's life. Don't be confused. This is a kid with a kid's face. But he's a terrorist! A terrorist who must never see the light of day. -Did you hear the news? -[man] Yeah. So, what do you say? -What do you think, is it okay? -Of course, it's not okay! -Of course, not. -Huh? -It's politically influenced. -[Lea] Yes. Let's see what Ahmad says. Hello. So, Ahmad. What do you say? Lea, it's a big shock. No? It's too bad you went to trial! -[Lea] Why too bad? -It really is. -You should have made a deal. -There was no deal to make. Within a month he'd have gotten the same judgment, no? I don't know, what do you think? I chose to go to trial! I'm the one who decided to go to trial. Looks like an annoying verdict, from what I see. Very superficial. From the outset, it seems, I still haven't read it all. "The only thing the court must determine regarding the stabbing is whether he intended to kill. Did he decide to cause death?" And... The court finds he did. "The defendant revealed his intentions to the interrogators, attesting to his heart's desire. 'It would be a pity if we kill children.'" From which the judge concludes: "Their sole intent was to kill." [scoffs] He claims that this demonstrates the kid's intent to kill. How? I don't understand. "Their sole intent was to kill." Fantastic. And... "The defendant's claim that stabbing the boy deviated from their plan not to hurt children or elderly is rejected by us as we determine that there never was such a plan." Wow. Wow, wow, wow. Wow, not a sliver of hope. It's as if I live with the illusion... that I can do something in the world, make an impact, that there's someone to reason with. It's strange... I'm not willing to give up trying. And our kid didn't even use his knife. It's really strange to me... I wonder... Don't the judges see he's a kid? And a nice one? A bit lost, what did he decide, what did he think, he testified. There are all those quotes from his testimony. As if there's some kind of impenetrable screen, like the separation barrier, that can't be overcome. When it comes to "security." Strange. We always lose. [in English] For us, a victory is if we get a deduction of a year out of five. We did our day, you know? If we manage to visit a client while he's still in interrogation. If we just manage to see him and say: "Hi, I'm your lawyer." Many of my friends laugh at me by now. I start a new case with all the possible optimism. And I'm sure now in this case, I'm going to win. I'm going to make it. This person will not be deported. And again and again and again, time after time. -You never win those cases? -No. Until now, I'm sorry to say, never. [in Hebrew] She doesn't manage to defeat the occupation. Even though she's sure it'll happen in her lifetime, and thanks to her. On the one hand, I'd like to have her powers. To take her Wonder Woman suit and put it on and have no fear. Not really have no fear, but have no qualms or hang ups. To go forth without hesitation. On the other hand, that's exactly what I wouldn't want. It's the outfit I'd never choose. And yet, it's so rare to meet women like that, who do their thing so unapologetically. I wouldn't trade her in. I'm willing to pay the price for there to be room for a woman like that to exist, as she is. [Lea] If Israel abided by the Geneva Conventions, the Convention Against Torture, the Convention for the Protection of Children, we wouldn't need the Supreme Court! Lea Tsemel, explain your position. We're forced to petition the Supreme Court often, -and come out empty-handed. -[man] Maybe because you're wrong! Because "security" is the dragon that guards the judiciary's gates! In other countries, you couldn't even petition! But no other country has a 25-year occupation! Ms. Lea Tsemel, stick to the topic! My clients have no recourse other than the Supreme Court, and it slams the door in their face! [female newscaster] After a decade of legal battles, they pose for a victory photo. We made history today! What a moving decision. A just ruling, a warranted ruling. Too bad we didn't conduct this struggle 30 years ago. [newscaster] Nine years, nine justices, and one Supreme Court bottom line: "All interrogation methods that entail physical pressure are illegal." [Lea] As soon as the Supreme Court handed down its decision, I knew that for once, we'd won! The security service had been exposed. It was a wonderful feeling. I wanted to burst into song. Shame on you! You're the enemy of the secret service! Today's ruling is a climax in my legal career. The Supreme Court canceled the secret service's "special methods." -What did we achieve? -[interviewer] Yes. Torture became more problematic and less obvious. They can't do it anytime and anywhere. It became a bit more sensitive. But over time, that too is eroding. [interviewer] What happened in practice? The secret service doesn't abide by it. [interviewer] What's justice? [chuckles] I don't know. Since I don't believe in justice, I have no answer. [interviewer] What's a fair trial? A fair trial means giving both sides an equal chance. But since the balance of power is a priori unequal, a fair chance is never given. Lea believes in it, I don't. It's to Lea's advantage that she believes in it. [murmuring] -It's just me, guys. -[laughter] Wait there! [camera shutters clicking] Come. Come on. [reporter] We hear the prosecution asked for 12 years in an adult prison. They said something to that effect. He expressed remorse... Especially to the other kid, who was stabbed. [reporter] What did he say to him? He said he's sorry that the kid got hurt. We expect the court to take that into full consideration in their judgment. That's it. It ain't over 'til it's over. Where's Tareq now? Still the same documentary? Have you seen attorney Tareq Barghout? Allahu akbar. Don't drag it, pick it up! -No, no! -[Tareq] How, from there? -[Lea] Like this. -[Tareq] Hold on. You're becoming an old lady, can't do it yourself. Sure I can! You wanna arm wrestle me? [both laugh] -Can you help me find an intern? -[Tareq] You need an intern? My intern left me, I told you! Listen! Yeah? The guy worked with me for two and a half weeks. I asked him to file a court request electronically. He says: "I don't know how." I said: "How come? They taught you!" I said: "I gotta go. Ask Ahmad or Suheila. Otherwise, eat shit. You have to file it." Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy... The next morning, I find a note on my desk. "Dear attorney Tsemel, I worked with you between these dates, you told me to eat shit. I'm leaving. Thanks, goodbye." So I need an intern who can "eat shit." I'll look for someone like that! He didn't realize it's the usual slang? You always call me "motherfucker." -Right! -[laughs] [Lea hums] Can you open the gate please? Guard! Warden, open the gate. -[man] They didn't let Mona in. -Why? -They said the judge will only let her parents enter. -[Lea] No way! -Tell them to let her in. -[Lea] I'll talk to the judge too! -I'll talk to the guards first. -Tell them to let her in. Mona! Come! [camera shutters clicking] -[woman] That's it? -[Lea] What? -Was she sentenced? How much? -Eleven years. -[Mona] Israa! -No! -My love. -My life. [Mona] What do you mean 11 years? -[Israa's mother] Why 11 years? -[Mona] God almighty! -Eleven? -[Israa's mother] What for? What did she do? What do they want from her? What did she do to you people? [Israa's father] This is a state of sinners! A mafia state! God is greater than you! -God is great! -[Israa's father] God is greater than you! [Mona] God is greater than you! God is great and you know it! You found her guilty for saying: "God is great!" All the while knowing and believing that God is great! [camera shutters clicking] [reporter] Ahmad, how you doing? [Mona] Criminals! You say we're terrorists, but you're the terrorists! [Israa's mother sobs] His sentencing is at 1:00? [camera shutters clicking] [reporter] What do you think of your sentence? -[woman] Lea, what did they give him? -Twelve years in prison. Go on, prepare the press. -[Tareq] Lea, what do you want to do now? -[Lea] What? Are you staying or going? There are reporters, we have to face them. You'll be next to me. -You can't get out of it. -I'm not trying to! Come stand with me, it's hard for all of us. -I'm going to talk to... Lea! -What? Tareq! Yes! -What now? -I can't. [Lea] Okay, never mind. I'm sure you'd like to hear the response of the defense... [Tareq] Motherfucker! [Lea] To the two sentences issued today in the Jerusalem District Court. Our response is: We've been defeated! Both in the case of Israa Jaabis and in the case of the minor. But our defeat, as a legal team, is nothing compared to the far-reaching and long-lasting defeat for Israeli society and its judicial system. The court ignored the fact that this is a national conflict. It attributed anti-Semitic sentiments to both defendants, which neither of them expressed at any stage. But it's convenient to think: "They only want to hurt the Jews!" Fifty years of occupation were stricken from the record, and vanished from the judges' consciousness, unfortunately. I hope it won't vanish from the public's consciousness. -There is an occupation! -[reporter] Does national conflict permit murder? And it must be responded to. And everyone does so according to their capabilities. The victims, the vanquished, the children, the women, respond in their own way. The expectation... that Palestinians can find justice in Israeli courts, may have been buried for good, I hope not. I really hope not. The path to the Supreme Court still lies ahead of us. We will appeal as soon as possible, in pursuit of justice. Thank you! Your name and title? Lea Tsemel, losing lawyer. That's the title. Lea, why appeal if you no longer believe in the courts? I want to change them. I'll force them to change! Drive, I'll direct you. -Via Begin Road? -No! -Take a left here. -[driver] I know how to go. No, don't go on Begin. Shut up! I'll guide you, I'm telling you the truth. Left! Enter through... Go straight, then right. We'll hit traffic! The biggest traffic jam is on Begin Road! -Not at this hour. -Huh? Ha! Put Supreme Court on the GPS, you'll see! -[phone rings] -Just don't listen to his directions. [in English] Hello. [in Hebrew] Of course, we'll be appealing both the verdict and the sentence. We'll see, maybe. We can only hope. Hope is what keeps us going, otherwise we'd have given up long ago. [Tareq's ringtone plays] I'm a very angry optimistic woman. [Tareq sighs] Lea, Lea, Lea. [door slams] [Lea hums] [continues humming] [Lea] Hey, Yasser. Tareq! Yasser! Oy, oy, oy, oy. Aye, aye, aye... [laughing]
