First, a general checking Lay all! Out, it has AIDS! High pressure! Diabetic! Heart sick! Ill! Herpes! Be quiet! Kidney stones. Skin infection. Mentally ill. Asthmatic. You're stupid! Don't pretend to be a doctor. You're just a stinky fishmonger! Which sells fresh fish. Your stethoscope nor deceives. You're an idiot! Leave me alone. Aunt! Hello. Why are you so late? The train was full, you know? Besides, I had to... pay taxes for the TV. It took me an eternity. Could you solve everything, dear nephew? You are very responsible. - I will show you your house. - Yes, thanks. This is wonderful! - I couldn't live anywhere else. - Yes, dear aunt. You must change the way you walk. Wait, I will show you. Apart the legs, hands behind the back... - and the head up. - ?Why? Because you'll look like a Lord. - Arms, folded behind. - Ah, well. Everything is different now, everything has changed... You know? In China the lords walk like this now. Arms on your back and head up. They call them capitalist in HK, - believe me. - Are you serious? Why would I lie to you? A capitalist is the same than an aristocrat. They're equal. - What do you want? - To buy. - Light a Balrok first. - What? - Have you light any? - No, not yet. Then, do it now. Show your respect and you can continue. Here. Stop. You must pay to enter. - Come on, give him something. - How much? - Are you from Hong Kong or Taiwan? - Hong Kong. 100 Hong Kong dollars. Just cash, I don't accept credit cards. Come on, give it to him. Thank you very much. Can we see the goods now? Please, don't forget the condoms. Stand up, stand up, come on, stand up, come on, come on! Come on, show your placards. That is ok. Look at them. - Look at them. - Choose one! They're high quality. She is only 2500. What's that? It's a return from Singapore, it's a bargain. - A return? - Yes, it's a factory default. Look calmly. This looks very appetizing, eats little but is very strong. Why is she priceless? Yes! She is special. She doesn't accept any buyer. She only wants men from HK. She is very intellectual, knows many words. Is she intelligent? Really? Would be perfect for you, you are intelligent as well. How can I take her to HK? Don't worry about that, just pay me! You took so long! I've been waiting for hours. Hold on, we go. Yes, good. We have to go there. - To these houses? - Yes, right there. We will arrive soon. How can I call you? Now that you belong me. I don't care. - Do you like Ah Chi? - Alright. Now that you're here, all will be different. It's difficult to find a house in HK. I could be rich and live in an apartment... but I cheated on the exam. And couldn't be a doctor. Everyone cheated. But I had bad luck. And I became a fisherman. It's a disgusting life! Fisherman's life can be nice too. Don't talk nonsense! Life is unfair, I was unlucky. Don't be pessimistic. We have arrived. Get off. Be careful. Help me. You're an illegal inmigrant, don't dare to step outside. - But... - and don't look other men. And now wash your face. One moment! Where can I place my belongings? Wherever you want. This is ours. Put them in the corner, there's place enough. Yes. Beautiful! Ah Chi, he brought vegetables. Open your mouth. You need some teeth to be filled. Let me see your tongue. 120/70 It's very good. Breath. Breath! Breath harder! Turn back. Breath. Breath! Breath! Alright. Come here. Closer. Tell me Does it hurt there? Are you sure? Show me your breast. Hand off! Nothing. Lay down. Take away your panties. I'm only checking. Don't be afraid. Take off your panties! Don't be afraid. Hands off! The old pine is in the centre, a natural cave, a never ending sight... over the mountains. It's a Quan Chin poem. Never heard of it. First, I will take a look to the cave. It must be hungry. I told you it must had hungry. - Are you going to sleep? - Yes, I'm tired. - I give your money back. - ?What money? - The money you paid for me. - No, keep it. Save it. Then I will keep it. Anyway we are husband and wife. How did your previous wife die? She was dismembered. - What happened to her body? - It was eaten. Are you serious? How did they cook her? The breast was roasted, hands and feet were used for soup. Is that true? Of course not. It was just a lie. Did you belive it? I'm not a fisherman, I'm a real doctor! Everybody is unfair with me! I'll kill them all! Shut up! What are you doing? Take away that bloody fish! Don't get closer! - Are you afraid of it? - It's just blood. - No! Eat it! Eat it! Your parents were revolutionaries. You must learn. Stop crying! Eat the fish! Get out! Come here! Let me go! Let me go! You will pay for it, bitch! ?You'll pay when I get you! Come on, I will help you. - It is very heavy. - It doesn't matter! Give it to me! - Where do I place it? - That place. Be careful. I will. I bring vegetables and other things, I come on Thursday and Friday. - If you need anything, just ask me. - Really? How much is it? Nothing, I exchange vegetables for you fishes. Tell me your name. My name is Ah Jen, and yours? Mine is Ah Chi. Ah Jen? What do you do? I am a farmer. I work in the countryside with my granny... my mother is dead. It's boring and you don't earn many money. It's a loss of time. Don't say that. We are happy, aren't we? You look like my brother. Brother? I love this. I'm sorry if I scared you. And I'm glad you fell into the water. Come, we have arrived. Who is she? My wife, miss Chic. Shut up! It will be funny. I brought her here so you can learn. Learn what? About what? You come from the interior. And you don't know about it. complicated can be simple, and simple can be complicated. Undress. Lay down. Look if you want to learn. Take notes of everything. - This is called, "Hit the cow". - Yes. Can you moan a little bit? Yes This position makes us crazy. This position is called: "Hit the bottle across the river". This is known as: "Old cow at the countryside". This is "Hanging drum over the dragon". Did you look carefully? The you can show what you have learned. Come! Get out! On you kness. Come here! - Doggy style. - Yes. Come on, turn around. Hey, come on, crouching! "The frog crosses the river." Come on, try it, you don't know what you're missing. I'm sorry. See you. - What are you doing here? - I was just bringing some vegetables. - Then you can leave. - I'm leaving. I'm leaving. What is this photo doing here? I don't know, nothing. Your last wife was very beautiful. Really beautiful! Ah Chi? Ah Chi! It's you! If you don't need me, I will leave. Ah Jen! Come here and take a look. Ah Jen! Look at the eel's shape. It's long and fat. Don't stop! See how beautiful is everything! Precious, isn't it? You don't have a place like that in the City. But we can do everything here. I plant and I take care of all this vegetables. All this work is done by both of us. Ah Jen! - What do you want? - Come here, I want to show you something. Be quick. Ah Jen, I want to introduce you to this young girl. He is my grandson, Ah Jen. - Chat for a while, he is lovely. - Good afternoon. What do you do? Talk me about you. Don't run , don't run. Do you want to go out with me? Why are you running backwards? Don't you want to chat with me? Come on, chat with me. You heard my grandmother. Where do you live? Don't you want to chat with me? Decide yourself. You are crazy! Hey! Leaving so early? She didn't want to chat with me, granny. What's happening? Your brother is a revolutionary! This is the result. He deserved death! Aunt. - You're here at last. - Ah Chi! Be careful. Wait, I will help you. - Thanks, uncle N?23. - You're welcome. I came to visit you and to talk to my nephew. - Esto est? resbaladizo. - S?. - Do you like your new life? - Yes, aunt. Stay for lunch. What's that important for you to come personally? I need his advice, you know? Thanks. That's enough. - What do you want? - I have opened a store... and I need money. - I was wondering if you can lend it to me. - I don't have any money. Come on, you must earn many money with the fish farm. The business is going bad, I don't have money, I spent all when I bought her. You can't do this to me, I'm your aunt. - I need the money, it's urgent. - That's not my problem. I can't lend it to you. Enough! Bastard! Why were you born?

Why? Do you know him? Or what? Please, forgive him. He wasn't serious. No way! Not after last night. You heard perfectly what he told me. And he is not going to lend me the money. He is that way. I'm old! I made a long journey and he won't help me. But when he needed something, I always helped him. He is a bad nephew! Ah Chi! I'm bringing vegetables! - I'm coming. - Ah Chi? Leave me. Why?
