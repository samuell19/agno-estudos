(upbeat suspenseful music) (horns honking) (traffic passing) (suspenseful music) - Don't suppose you got any change, a spare dollar or anything. - All right. (soft suspenseful music) There you go. - Oh. Hey, man, thanks, man. All right, yeah, whoo! (upbeat suspenseful music) - Hey, Jimmy, how's it going? - Hey, thanks, babe. - That girl, who is she? - Kim, a computer technician, she's a doll. - Right. - Have a good one. - You too. (everyone chattering) (phones ringing) - All right, you're gonna need a new board. - Oh great. - You relax, get a coffee. - [Manager] She's done her hair different. Well, I guess you're right. - Of course I'm right. I worked on the same floor as her in Chicago. Jesus, what kinda security department are you running here anyways? Look, she's even calling herself Kim. - The problem is-- - What kinda stupid-ass bullshit is this? Don't you look at the bulletins? The girl's been flipping transfers. She almost got away with a million bucks in Chicago. (group chattering) (suspenseful music) (alarm blaring) (suspenseful music) - Ah! (crashing) (suspenseful music) (alarm blaring) (suspenseful music) - Whoa, Jimmy! - Sorry, Kim, alarm's going off again. - Yeah, you want me to check it out for you a little later? - Sure, yeah, thanks, Kim. - Sure. (suspenseful music) - Idiot. (suspenseful music) (horn honking) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) - Whoa. - It's all right. I'm on your side. - That's comforting. Who are you? - Who I am is relatively insignificant. I'm just a representative. It's my clients who are interested. They're bankers. A private client bank in London. And, well, how shall I put this? They've decided they want someone to test their system. - How do you mean? - Where do we begin? Perhaps Mexico. A quarter of a million dollars is a lot of money. There's also an investment bank in Dallas, I believe. You were a little unlucky there. And Chicago? Very unlucky there. - What are you suggesting? - A trip to England. Meet my clients. All expenses paid, of course. (engine revving) (gentle music) - You don't represent no bank in London. - No. My clients come from far less affluent places. Like Africa, or South America. Or Golanda. Golanda, it's in Southwest Asia. I first went there 20 years ago. It was a paradise. 1989, they decided to turn Golanda into the travel destination for the '90s. To build their first hotel, they bulldozed three fishing villages. To supply it with water, they caused a drought. They told them tourism would provide jobs. It has. The villagers now watch white pimps recruiting their teenage daughters. Last year, I went to Golanda to take the developers to court. Waste of time. They had the judge in their pockets. I decided it's time to play by their rules. - So where do I fit in? - You can stop them. The major investors are all private. A small consortium put together by Watson Tyler, an investment bank in the city. Drain their accounts, Kim. Call it compensation. Take 10%, you'd still be rich. (engine roaring) (bell tolling) (birds chirping) - Oh really? Congratulations. No, yes. That'd be good, yes. I'll ring you. Bye. Hi. Just been trying to find you somewhere to stay. I'd put you up myself, but I got a house full of Freshstonian refugees at the moment. - That's okay, I'll find somewhere. - No no no, I insist. You're our guest. Anyway, how'd you get on? - Yeah, I took a look. It's very small, they don't carry cash, so security won't be a big deal. And what's the minimum investment, five? - Probably. The consortium had a 50 million line of credit. - Yeah, they'd need at least five million in their accounts for that. I'm gonna have to take a look inside. I'll need some help, someone who can pose as a client. Smart, assured-looking. I don't know, I could be his girlfriend or something. Do you know anyone? - Smart. There is someone, Cliff. Works for the Council, town planner. Very committed. (engine idling) (car door closing) - [Kim] That's a nice place. - Yeah, he, uh, he inherited it. Oh, Cliff, hi. - Jeremiah? - Cliff, this is Kim. - Hi. - Hello. - Kim's a friend. We need to talk to you about something. - Well you'd better come in. Oh, shit, those bastards next door. The bin man doesn't come till Friday. This is bloody unneighborly. - Hey, that's my stuff. - Your stuff? Excuse me, excuse me, what do you mean it's your stuff? - My fault, Cliff. I shouldn't have presumed. It's just, well, I was wondering if you could put Kim up, just for a day or two. I've still got the Freshtonians at my place. - Oh. - Does that still run? - Of course. Jesus. Please, be careful. We'll leave these here till they're sorted out. - They are sorted out. (grinder humming) (banging) - Well, you know me, Jeremiah. I've never been afraid to get my feet wet. Unlike Tom or some of those other committeemen. But isn't this all a little bit chancy? - Well hardly. All you gotta do is go in, pretend to have a bit of money, not difficult I should have thought. - Well it's all right for you. You always avoid doing anything risky by saying it puts your work in jeopardy. (soft music) We used to have a slogan. Beneath the paving stones, a beach. - Yeah? I always wanted to live on a beach. - Well it's not a real beach. The beach sort of represents an ideal, a better life. It's something to aspire to. - You still doing your sculptures? - Yeah, yeah. When I get the chance. - [Kim] Oh, so you made this? - Sure. I'd do it all the time if I could make a living at it. - Still, being a town planner, that sounds okay. - Town planner. Traffic calmer. - Traffic calming, so you're not an architect then? - No, no, I trained, but I didn't really get very far. I ended up working for the Council doing building regulations. I'm in roads now, speed ramps, one-way systems. It's all terribly glamorous. So, once you're in the bank, what exactly are you looking for? - Right, a cellar, storeroom, an attic. Someplace I can hide my laptop. It's gotta be close to their network, but that's okay because there'll be cable running everywhere. - Wait wait wait, you're not gonna plant it while we're there? - No no, no no, I just need to check things out first. I'll find a way of installing it later. - [Cliff] Sounds risky. - Well, it's not as risky as working from the inside. - Sorry. Sorry. Look, what I don't understand is why you have to plant something there in the first place. I mean, surely, can't you just connect into their phone lines? - Well that's what I will be doing, but I gotta get to the transfers before they reach the server. After that, they're encrypted. Look, it's simple. Watson Tyler make a transfer. I intercept it, I change the address code and reroute it. Instead of going, let's say, the States, it ends up in a bank account we open in Switzerland. You see? - Yeah, sort of. - So how much you think we might make? - Who knows? Could be five million, 25 million. Of course, it could also be 25 cents. - You mean it's a gamble. - I don't make the transfers. There wouldn't be any money to back them up. No, all I do is reroute them. - [Jeremiah] So what do you think, Cliff? - Messy. (keys striking) - Kim? (keys striking) Christ almighty. That's original Baker light. - Yeah? We have these push-button phones in the States. - What are you doing with it? - Oh, sorry, I didn't bring the right connector. - You're not linked up to something? - Mm, it's a premium service credit check. Watson Tyler won't even look at you if you're not on here. Right, you're Tony Brummel, and you're 40. 39. You made your money in scrap. - Scrap? - You're a bachelor, which means I can be your fiancee. - Great. - By the way, you went over your limit on your credit card. - How'd you know about that? - Don't worry. I fixed it. - Drink your tea before it gets cold. (engine idling) (light music) (door buzzing) - Yes. - [Cliff] I have an appointment with Mr. Wimborne. - Name please. - [Cliff] Tony Brummel. - Oh yes. (door buzzing) (light suspenseful music) - May I take your coats? - Of course. Hey, is that Mr. Wimborne? - That, madame, is Lord Childwell, our revered chairman. - Tony, that's the coat I was telling you about. - Don't overdo it. - Do sit down. I'll tell Mr. Wimborne you're here. - Excuse me, do you have a little girls' room? - There is a ladies', madame, around the corner on the right. - Thank you. I love a man in uniform. (light suspenseful music) (clock ticking) (light suspenseful music) (toilet flushing) (light suspenseful music) - Look what I found in the gents'. (clock ticking) (sighing) (phone ringing) - Mr. Brummel anywhere? - Mr. Wimborne. - Ah, Mr. Brummel. - How do you do? - Tony, Tony, some bastard's stolen my shoes. - This is Miss Remington, my fiancee. She's American. - Yes. - They were found in the gents', madame. - Gents? Oh, I wondered what all those hand basins were for. Stupid. - So, if you were to become one of our favoured clients, there's every chance that I might be able to manage your investments myself. You see, to us here at Watson Tyler, it's the relationship that's all important. That's why I insist on having no more than one or two portfolio managers and only half a dozen dealers. - So it's all quite small then? - With an annual turnover of over 300 million pounds, I hardly think the word small is appropriate. Do you, Mr. Brummel? - Quite. Well I'm very impressed, Mr. Wimborne, very, very impressed, and very interested, and I was wondering if we could have a quick look round. - Certainly, certainly, Perhaps you might first give me a clearer idea of the sort of thing you'd like us to be putting together for you. Now, aggressive? - No, not really. - Soft then? - A bit of both, I'd say. (giggling) - A bit of both. I take it by that you mean a mixed portfolio? - Right. - Hm, well I have got something we've been putting together in Asia, building project, very aggressive. And I take it you'd need some fiduciary deposits as well? - Definitely. - [Wimborne] How much? - Six. - Six million, excellent. And, uh, currency derivatives? - 10. - [Wimborne] 10. - Honey, don't forget that little boat that you promised me. - Yeah, the boat. Better make that eight. - Very well. Eight. Now who are you banking with currently? - Oh, you know, just the local-- - That cute little place you took me to in Zurich, Dvorzac's or something. - Devoriks? - That's it. - Yes, that's it. - (chuckles) Devoriks. But of course before I transfer my portfolio from Zurich, I will of course need to seek independent advice. So if we could have that look around, we really ought to be going. - Yes, certainly. If you would like to follow me, sir, madame. Our dealing room, where millions become billions. (chattering) - Or where billions become millions. (chuckling) - Mr. Brummel, let me show you are our transfer bay. (throat clearing) - We thought we heard something out there. - Right. - [Sally] It was nothing, though. - Here, let me. - [Wimborne] Thank you. - Lovely. - Well, as I say, this is our transfer bay. Everything's pretty much undertaken by our Miss Price here. And, well, I think that's about it really, apart from a few secretaries. - Oh, look. It's your computer. It's so big. - Enormous. Well, thank you. - Miss Remington. Miss Remington? - Right. - I expect you'll be hearing from me very soon. - Excellent. Delighted to meet you, Miss Remington. - Likewise, bye. - Bye. - Bye. - New client, sir? - God, I hope not. The man's a scrap dealer for heaven sake. No, I expect he just set up the meeting to impress that bimbo. (chuckling) - Shit. - What? - Forget it. - What is it? I don't understand. - Everything's buffered before it's encrypted. They got a dedicated server. I can't intercept it. - Kim, what does that mean? - Look, I was planning to connect my laptop to the bank's internal network, then sit at your house and operate it through a modem, a remote. That way I could reroute the transfers before the got encrypted. - Well why can't you? - Because the transfer clerk has got her own server. She's not on the network. - Hang on, what's a server? What is it, a computer? - Yes, if you like, she's got her own computer. - Hold on. Where, where is it? - It's in the rack with the rest of them. - Well then it must be connected up with some sort of cable. - Yes, but it's only 10 feet from her desk. Where would you like me to patch in? - Under the floor. - How would I get down there? - I don't know, but if you noticed, all the building, in the back, all the rooms, they're all fairly new. It's an extension. - They all look the same to me. - Yeah, I know, it's all fake regency. But the point is, in the yard, there's a manhole cover, and it's brand new. - Yeah, what's that mean? - It means they've obeyed building regulations. - That's some job you've got. - So this is what you do, you read plans all day? - Yeah, read plans, look at maps, study reports. Go out, take a look around, it's all pretty boring really. - No kidding. - Hold that. There, you see. There's a storm drain, goes right underneath. And there's the new inspection shaft. - I don't get it, Cliff. Why is it so important that it's new? - Because building regulations state that if you cover up an old inspection shaft, you've gotta build a new one. - Yeah? - You see? It means the old inspection shaft still runs right underneath the new extension. It's all welded up, of course. - I get it. - Right, so all we've gotta do is find out where the storm drain comes out. (soft piano music) Let's go down the sewers. - Why not? - Project Orpheus, they call it. In 10 years' time, we'll have mapped out all of underground London. - So what is this, a souped-up CAD programme? - Essentially, yeah. We're about to put in a lot of accelerators. Hey, what are you hanging about with him for? This man's a Luddite. I keep telling him computing's the new Renaissance. - I rather like it in the Dark Ages. - Now, where's this inspection shaft? - Orff Street. - Show me. - Number 27, Watson Tyler. (computer whirring) - Got it. (soft suspenseful music) East or west? - West. How wide is it? - Five foot. Where we going? Gotta be the river. South, right? - [Cliff] What's that? - Grating. We're there. Printout? - Yes, please. - Now tell me you like it in the Dark Ages. - You'd have an hour, two at the most, even on a spring tide. - Forget it. - I thought you could leave the computer there. - Well not if I can't retrieve it easily. When's the next spring tide? - A month. - Shit. No, no way. See, for this job, I'm gonna have to devise something that makes my laptop emulate a terminal. It's the only way of pulling the transfers out of the buffer, and of course that's just, that's like leaving a signature. - Never mind about that for a minute. Say you've just got an hour, or two. How much could you get out? - Your guess is as good as mine. I told you, it's a gamble. - Of course we could always reduce the odds. - How? - Well, there is one time you can guarantee people will be desperate to get their money out of a bank. - When? - When it's going down. You see, I was thinking, all we have to do is start a rumour. - Oh come on, their clients wouldn't listen to us. - Yeah, but they will listen to the chairman. - Yeah, well, that's some guy in a fur wrap. - Lord Childwell. Chairman of Watson Tyler and eight other companies. He's into banking, insurance, pharmaceuticals, publishing. - I don't get it. He's chairman of eight companies? - Oh, he doesn't do anything. He's just a lord on the board. They're all into it, gives the company prestige. How we gonna persuade him to start a rumour? - Mrs. Fawkes. - Oh that's it. That's it. Now listen, Jeremiah, I don't mind a little bit of computer fraud, but that's going too far! You know, people went to prison last time! - Wow. Who's Mrs. Fawkes? - Mrs. Fawkes, oh, she's a kind of photographer. (gentle music) - What are you saying, Jeremiah? - I'm just saying that, retrospectively, I think we may have been a bit rigid about things like, well, money. - Are you offering me money? - I was just thinking. You've always said how much you hate that shop. You could retire, be a sculptor. 10%, that could be a million. Or two. I've been talking to the Freshstonians. Apparently, when they kidnapped their president last year they used a limo. Ran some anaesthetics through to the back. All pretty painless. You've got some friends who work in hospital. - You've spoken to Kim about this? - Yeah, she'll help. Look, I'm not asking you to change. Just do it for the same reasons you've always done. Be good to yourself, for once. Through sin grace will abound. - But you have two beards. - Double bluff. Security cameras. - Oh. I made some coffee, you want some? - Yes, all right. I'll fix it. - [Kim] Hey, relax, it's gonna be a steal. When I do something, I don't mess up, all right? - Uh, right. (traffic passing) - Where can he have got to? He's cutting it a bit fine, isn't he? - Maybe there's been a delay at the car rental. How reliable is this friend of Jeremiah's anyway? - How reliable are any of them? It's probably some bloke he hasn't spoken to since the '60s. - '60s, I never could work out how people got so much motivation out of one decade. Wow. - [Cliff] Oh what the hell? (doors opening) - Sorry. Bugger let me down. I had to get the Freshtonians to help out. Trouble is, it's got to be back at the embassy tonight. The ambassador's got a meeting in the morning. - Oh, well, thanks very much, Jeremiah. Well that's it, forget it. - Oh come on. You can pick him up in the limo and take him up to the Lake District in your van. Your blindfolding him, remember? - It'll be less conspicuous. - Yeah. - All right. Gaaa! (upbeat music) - Careful, I promised them I wouldn't damage it. (upbeat music) (drill whirring) (upbeat music) (suspenseful music) - Yes? - Car for Lord Childwell. - I'm not expecting a car. - Oh. Didn't they call you about the emergency board meeting? - No, what emergency board meeting? - Watson Tyler, sir, seven o'clock. - I better ring in. - Well actually, we are running a bit late, and the traffic's terrible. - Well-- - [Cliff] There's a phone in the car. - All right. Let me get my coat. (suspenseful music) - Hello, Watson Tyler, this is Lord Childwell. Could you put me through to Alan Wimborne please? Hello, hello. Hello! Damn. (soft suspenseful music) Stop at this corner, will you? I want to get a Standard. - Uh, you couldn't wait until we get to the city, could you, sir? - No, I ruddy well could not. - [Cliff] Right-o, sir. - Harry. - Hello, Dennis, how are you? - I'm well, and you? - It's probably nothing. - I'll give you a lift, if you like. - That's very kind of you. - Listen, this is my neighbour. - We're giving him a lift. - Well thing is, sir, you see, it's the insurance. - What are you talking about? - I'm only covered to carry one, sir. - Look, if it's a bother. - No no, not at all. Get in, I'll sort this out. It's not my usual chap. - Well actually, sir, it is company policy, and we are running a bit late. I'm sure you understand. Mind your head, sir, thank you very much. You understand, sir, it's the insurance. Perhaps next time, cheerio. - Oi, you bloody hooligan, what's going on? - Shit. - Stop the car. Can you hear me in there? Pull over this minute. - [Cliff] Come on, come on. (banging) (dramatic music) - I can't reach it. Shit. (dramatic music) - Ooh. (dramatic music) (screaming) (engine roaring) - Right, that's it, you're fired. Do you hear me? Fired! - [Cliff] Come on, Kim, come on, for Christ sake. - Here goes. (air hissing) (dramatic music) - Stop this car, you bastard. (tyres squealing) (dramatic music) Stop it. Stop it. (dramatic music) (tyres squealing) (dramatic music) (engine idling) (hard breathing) - Well I think that went pretty well, don't you? (wheels squeaking) (gentle music) (engine revving) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) - Hello. - Is this Primrose Cottage? - Yes, it is. But there's lots of Primrose Cottages around here. What is it you want? - [Cliff] Well, are you-- - Granny, Granny, Granny, there's an old man in there, and he's all tied up with bits of string. - Wrong Primrose Cottage. - I'm not lying, Granny, promise. - All right, darling, you go inside. Let Granny deal with this. Um, I'm sorry, you must be Cliff, of course. - Yes. - Only I was expecting a limo. - Yes, well, I'm afraid we had a bit of trouble. - [Kim] Who are these people? - Lawyers, judges, politicians. She does a lotta work for the tabloids. - What a good dog. Good dog, good dog, there's a good dog. Sit. (dog whining) Good dog, very good dog. All right, what do you want? (dog barking) - Alice, what have you got there, dear? Hm? - Look, where are my clothes? Come on, you bastards, my clothes. - Oh shut up, Childwell, or I'll chop your ears off. - Oh. - Don't you know? Kidnap victims, they're supposed to develop a rapport with their captors. - Oh yes, I'm sure to be having you over for drinks after this, aren't I? - I want you to drive him at least 50 miles away. I've marked a place on here where he'll be found very quickly. - [Cliff] Okay. - What's this he's wearing? - Well I found it in the back of the van. I'm a bit worried about him getting cold. (upbeat dramatic music) (car banging) (upbeat dramatic music) (car door closing) (soft music) (rock splashing) (rock splashing) (soft music) (engine starting) (soft music) - I think I'm going to be sick. - [Cliff] Don't worry, nearly there. - [Kim] Maybe we should pull over. - [Cliff] Not yet, it's too deserted. - [Childwell] I really do think I'm going to be sick, you know. - It's your van. (soft music) (birds chirping) - Quick, quick. Quick, get him out. (groaning) Over here, over here. Come on, come on. Okay, Childwell, which ear do you use? I'm just kidding, just kidding. Come on, this is goodbye. Right, you'll be able to work your way out of that. - Oh, very generous of you. What happens if somebody finds me first? - Well make up a story. Now remember, Friday, 10:30. - And if I decide to go to the police? - Come on, you know the deal, Childwell. You don't want those photographs plastered all over the tabloids, do you? - You know how the English are about animals. - Right, anyway, be seeing you. - Oh yes, indeed. Be seeing you. - Cliff, I'm sorry, it just slipped out. Please forgive me. - It's all right, forget about it. I mean, even if he does know who the van belongs to, it won't do him any good. (birds chirping) - Morning. - Good morning. - Wait, wait, for God sake. Come back and untie me. - I'm sorry. I thought you was from up the house. - What? Oh, never mind. Just untie me please. (birds chirping) Oh, thank you. Oh. Now, where's the nearest telephone? - Phone box? - Well any phone will do, this is an emergency. - The nearest would be up at the house. - Well you better take me there then. - I suppose so. - Ah. - [Man] Oh he's a keen golfer, Sir Wilmont. - Wait. Did you say Wilmont? Not Sir Wilmont Carstairs, the judge? Oh yes, come to think of it, I did hear he'd retired. - Retired? - Well you know what I mean. - So you do know him then? - Sort of. He's a, he was a member of my club. - I thought you was a friend of Sir Wilmont's when I first saw you. (birds calling) (upbeat light music) (glass squeaking) (upbeat light music) - There's a man outside, mid-50s, one shoe, long johns. Friend of yours? - Really, oh. You better show him in then. - Lord Childwell. - Wilmont, we met at the club. - Of course, of course. - Look, please forgive my appearance. Things are not as they seem. - Oh? - Yes. I've had the most frightful experience. I've been, um, well, I've been, oh God. - Oh my dear fellow, you're in a most terrible state. Could I get you a brandy or something? - Oh yes. Yes, indeed, thank you. - Henry? A brandy for our guest. (engine revving) - Anything on the news? - No, nothing. - Ah, looks like we're halfway to the beach then. - You might be. I hate the beach. - So, you were blindfolded and tied up in the dark. And then what? - Uh, look, don't you want to know what they wanted? - What they wanted? Oh yes, of course. What did they want? - Well, on Friday morning, I've gotta ring Tony Carmichael, Ricky Sewell and Ronnie Styles and tell them that Watson Tyler are in trouble. - You'll start a run. - Yes. That's what they must want. Look, perhaps I should go to the police. - Let's not be too hasty. I know what those tabloids can do to a man. - Yes. Still, they can't be allowed to get away with this sort of thing. - No. If there's a crime, there must be punishment. And if the authorities are impotent, well then perhaps we can ... - How do you mean? - I'll help you, Harry. We'll track them down together. - Could we? Before Friday? - Yes, before Friday. We'll track them down and smoke them out. (upbeat light music) (soft suspenseful music) (liquid bubbling) - Kim? - Mm-hm. - Oh, Kim, that's my best milk pad. It's nonstick. - Not anymore. (liquid bubbling) (light music) - I say, are you sure you want to wear that ghastly old thing? I've got a lovely camelhair upstairs. - No, no, somehow, it feels appropriate. - All right, if you insist. Now a lake with a phone box? - Yes, those were the only sounds. The rest of it was more, well, there was a bumpy road and a cattle grid. You see it was more the, um, the, uh, the feel. - The feel? (cars crumpling) - Probably best if you slip your trousers off, isn't it? - Oh, uh, yes, very well. - This one of your parties, is it, Sir Wilmont? - Sort of. - No, it needs to be smaller. Oh no. Well, the size is right, but, uh, these sides, nope. Better, yes, definitely better, but the ridges on the floor need to be deeper. - Well if it's the deep ridges you like, it's a Muggy Thou you're after. - A Muggy Thou? - Yeah, try Jack's place over at Seafield. - Don't you think you ought to slip your trousers off, just to be sure? - No. This is the one. (light music) - [Wilmont] So, Jack, how about lending us this old jalopy? - I don't know, not for one of your parties, is it? - Sort of. - Oh no, not after last time. Tell you what, though, the price I'm asking, you may as well buy it. - Buy it? - Yes, Wilmont. Let's buy it. (upbeat light music) (gears grinding) (gears grinding) (soft suspenseful music) - I'm recycling. - Sorry. (doorbell ringing) I'll get it. What do you think it is? - Probably the cutting gear. Look, Kim, can't we open this later? - Are you kidding? - Be careful, it could the wetsuit. Kim? (plastic inflating) Kim! (air hissing) (glass breaking) (air hissing) (glass breaking) - I'd have preferred red. (upbeat light music) - Oh, they've both got a road running along the shore. Oh bugger, they've both got telephone boxes. It's too bad they don't mark the cattle grids. Well, it could be either. - Buttermere. - Why? - I don't know. Just a feeling. - Oh well, best slip your trousers off and get in the back then. (gears grinding) (upbeat light music) (muffler dragging) (engine starting) (siren blaring) (birds singing) - Oh, Sir Wilmont, thank God it's you. I got a right shock when I saw somebody in the back with no trousers. - (chuckles) Good day, Bert. - On your way to a party, are you, sir? (upbeat light music) - So, tell me, what exactly does happen at these parties of yours? - My parties? Oh yes. Well, it's no big secret. First, we get very big ... (vehicle rumbling) - Sorry, I couldn't hear a damn thing. (tyres squealing) (water lapping) - [Wilmont] Well, nothing there, I'm afraid. - Oh, well, it was worth trying. - Something wrong? - It's my glasses case. I could have sworn I, oh, wait. Yes. Wait a minute. There's something. What's this? Oh, it's a sticker. The sort of thing that charities give away. - What's it say? - I can't make it out. F-R, no, the rest of it's been rubbed away. - Let's see. F-R. E. E, that's definitely an E. F-R-E. Of course, free. Free, as in, free somebody. - You mean a slogan? Like those political types were? - Exactly. I tell you what, I bet the whole damn thing is political. Is there anything else? - Yes, wait a minute, there is something. Look at that. You are invited to a private viewing of sculpture by Janine Hawking. And there's another address. The Left Bank Art Gallery. - The Left Bank Art Gallery? What did I tell you? Political. (soft classical piano music) - Oh, all packed.? - Oh yes. - Now, are you sure you want to come to London? - Oh yes. If you can tolerate me. - Tolerate you? Wilmont, you've been wonderful over the past few days. A true friend. - [Wilmont] Thank you. - Besides, it'll be good to have company. The house seems so empty now. - Yes of course, your wife. I'm sorry. - It was my fault, you know. - Oh come now. - No, really. She was in such pain. Arthritis, crippling. And when the doctor offered us the salmite, it was me who told her it would be all right. - Did you give evidence at the trial? - No. Somehow I couldn't. But you know, I, I did pay for all their legal costs, anonymously, of course. I sent a large donation to the Salmite Action Group. It was worth it. The lawyer was absolutely brilliant. I sat at the back of the courtroom and watched him for a month. I don't know, perhaps I should have given evidence. It might have helped. - I doubt it. And anyway, a guilty verdict wouldn't have brought her back. - No. Sorry, I haven't told anyone that before. - Don't worry. Secrets are always safe with me. Now, how about one last game? - Ha, what? Now? (upbeat light music) Oh, yes. Yes, why not? (upbeat light music) (owls hooting) (birds chirping and calling) (light dramatic music) - Oh no. (engine revving) (goats bleating) - [Cliff] Now just look down here from there. Can you see? - [Kim] No, I still can't see the tunnel. - Yeah. (soft suspenseful music) (gulls calling) There. (soft suspenseful music) Can you see it? - Oh yeah. But how can you be so sure it's gonna be empty on Friday? I mean, it's low tide now. - Trust me. - I do. (light dramatic music) - Don't say a word, the damn woman insisted. Anyway, I got us our list. - Oh my. - There. - Peter, careful. - Don't worry. It's very well wrapped. What did I say? - It's by a follower of someone called Cristo, apparently. It's not wrapped. - You mean? - Not good, I'm afraid. - Oh dear, oh dear. We're never going to get through this lot by tomorrow. I tell you what, though. Perhaps we can find which of them have got Murray's Vans. - How? - Do you know Robert Hennings? Used to be on the force. - Good God, not that chief constable. - Yes. There was a bit of a scandal, wasn't there? (banging) - Yes, names and addresses. I understand, but if it could be as early as possible. Oh, that's marvellous. Yes, of course. I'll send you an invitation to the next one, Robert. Bye. (phone hanging up) - Direct action. - What? - Direct action. Apparently, all sorts of people have found it necessary to take direct action. Jesus attacked the money changers in the temple. And then there was Gandhi, the suffragettes. - Yes, quite. - A moral dilemma, are there times when the end justifies the means? - Yes, but where do you draw the line, hm? We can't have anarchy. - No, but you know, there are, oh, I don't know. - It sounds to me as if you've got a taste of tiger's blood. - How do you mean? - In India, the hunters used to drink tiger's blood because they say, you won't catch a tiger unless you start thinking like one. - So what stops you becoming like one? - I don't think you're supposed to go that far. Mind you, some of those wallers did give me some nasty scratches. Oh, anyway, I've spoken to Robert. He says they can easily find the addresses of anyone with a Murray's Van. - Ah. - [Wilmont] But it's not going to be until the morning, I'm afraid. - Oh damn. Still, ha ha, there can't be more than one or two. - (chuckles) No, no, quite. (crunching) (light suspenseful music) - Ha, right, well it's not this one, is it? That thing would never have made it to the Lake District. - [Wilmont] No. - So it's gotta be Williams, Cliff Williams. Suffolk, isn't it? - Yes. (engine revving) (soft music) - Will you do me up? - Yeah, sure. (soft music) - Thanks. (doorbell ringing) Oh shit. - What? Christ, it's Childwell. - He doesn't know what we look like, remember? - So, he's still standing outside my front door. - Leave it to me. - Jesus. (doorbell ringing) - Oh, hello, mon cheri. I'm so sorry, I am busy, but if you'd like to come back a little later. - Ah, um, yes. No no, I mean, no. - Oh. - I'm looking for a Mr. Williams, Cliff Williams. - Williams, no, he leave for Australia. It's my house now. (speaking foreign language) - Right, yes, sorry, well. Accent's just a bit of fun for the clients. - Oh, yes, of course. Sorry. No, I was just saying, I believe he has a Morris Minor van. - Oh, right, no, yes, sold that. Sold everything. - So, he's gone away for good? - Yeah, gone for good. Anyway, you sure you don't-- - No no, thanks all the same. - Mm. Be seeing you. - Please, Kim. Please, let's call it off. Now that Childwell's seen us, he isn't gonna make those calls. - Of course he will. As long as he thinks he hasn't found us, there's no way he'd take the risk. - All right. (suspenseful music) - This wetsuit, it was what, tight? (engines revving) (pedestrians coughing) - [Cliff] Shit. - Hey, it's nothing. - Better make sure. Better safe than sorry. (tyres squealing) (suspenseful music) - Sorry, it's Childwell. - Well this is going well. - Right, we'll see how they like being bound hand and foot. - Oh, yes, let's. (engines revving) (suspenseful music) (banging) (suspenseful music) (brakes squealing) - Down. - Down? - Down. (groaning) (suspenseful music) - God. (suspenseful music) - Come on. (suspenseful music) - Look out. (horn honking) (tyres squealing) (horn honking) - I shoulda known this was one-way. - [Kim] Why? - [Cliff] What are you doing? (suspenseful music) (tyres squealing) (suspenseful music) (tyres squealing) (suspenseful music) (gears grinding) (suspenseful music) - There they go! (suspenseful music) (air hissing) - Cliff! (tyres squealing) Oh! Ah! (suspenseful music) (screaming) (brakes squealing) (water lapping) - Well, I guess he isn't gonna be making any phone calls in the next hour. But that doesn't mean we can't do it. - No, Kim, please, no. - What? Why waste the opportunity? Especially if we can't get in for another month. I mean, we should at least do a recci. Who knows, they could make some big transfers. We could get lucky. - Get lucky? We haven't got lucky yet, have you? Now you give me one good reason why we should. Just one. (soft romantic music) - Wait here a moment. There's a little man I know. I'll have him pick us up. - Oh, yes, right. Good. (water lapping) (soft mysterious music) (crashing) (soft mysterious music) - Are you Guffin's man? - Guffin's man? Ah yes, that's it, Guffin's man. - He's not Guffin's man. - He's not? - No, he's a lawyer. - He is? - Me, sorry, no. - No? I'd recognise you anywhere. You're Jeremiah Harper. I sat at the back of a courtroom and watched you once. The Salmite case. You were brilliant. - I was? - Yes, brilliant. We talked briefly after the case. You won't remember me. It was my wife, she um ... - Sorry, um. I don't, there were so many. Yes, yes, of course. Wait. What are you doing here? - I need your help. I'll explain, but first let's get you home. (soft mysterious music) - Ah. (soft mysterious music) It's up there. - So much for Project Orpheus. This is nowhere near five feet. - Yeah, looks like we're walking. (soft mysterious music) (water lapping) Hold it. This is it. - What are you? - Virgo. - Oh. (torch hissing) (soft mysterious music) - Tide's rising fast. - Yeah, I know. (banging) - Did you hear that? - No, I didn't hear anything. - Hm. Virgo. - Is that a new plate? - Yeah. It's only two and a half tonnes. Pedestrian weight. - What does that mean? - They should have used at least 10 tonnes, transport weight. These guys have been economising. - Good. (torch hissing) (keys striking) (sniffing) - Can you smell burning? - No. Did you put your fag out? (torch hissing) (soft mysterious music) (clanging) - Better get Cecil. - I doubt they heard that. That floor's 18 mill particle board. - I hope they're not economising on that as well. (soft mysterious music) - I can't hear anything. - But it was really loud. - I'm sure you heard something, miss, but if I had a pound for every funny noise that was-- - But it was just beneath us. - Honestly. - Honestly. - Might seem like that, but you take it from me. Sounds can carry. Did I ever tell you about that time in Aiden? 34 degrees, it was. We were in the trenches. The sun was coming down. (computer beeping) - That's it. Transfer desk is just there. (soft mysterious music) (keys striking) (soft mysterious music) (keys striking) (soft mysterious music) (wires clicking) Shouldn't something be happening? - Not yet, I gotta work out how it's configured first. Okay, anything? - [Cliff] No. - Now? - Nothing. - Right, I'll force a handshake. - That's it. So all this stuff's being transferred to Zurich, right? - No, gotta log on first. I'm going through the developer's back door. - Yeah. - Mm-hm. - Nice. - Okay, now, all I gotta do is find a phone line. (keys striking) - My phone's gone dead. - Oh. (soft mysterious music) - How much? - It's only 1,600. Hardly worth going out of the buffer. What's up? - A bit of cramp. How do we know the money's being transferred to Switzerland? - We don't. We'll have to check up on it when we get out. - Oh, terrific. I better see if we're trapped yet. Jesus, Kim, we haven't got long. - All right, all right. - Ow. (crashing) - All right, where was it this time? - Down there somewhere. - Well I suppose I better go down there somewhere and take a look then, hadn't I? (phone ringing) - Well if it's not too much trouble, Cecil. I mean, it's only your job, isn't it? - They must have heard us. Why else would they stop making the transfers? - I don't know, Cliff. Can they get down here? - Kim. (soft mysterious music) (Cecil muttering) (soft mysterious music) (Cliff muttering) - Oh! - Did you hear something then? - No. Come on, come on. - 61. 61. 61. 61. Oh bugger. (soft mysterious music) Ah, 61. (soft suspenseful music) (phone dialling) (soft suspenseful music) (Cecil muttering) Oh, would you believe it? That's not 61. It's 19. (laughing) - So I said, can't you get plastic surgery for that sorta thing on the National Health? (laughing) He said no. (chuckling) - No, no, of course I don't wanna lose you, Ronnie. Really, I don't know where you heard this from. (Ronnie shouting on phone) Right, yes, of course, straight away. (phone ringing) Anthea? - Yes, Mr. Wimborne. Hello, Mr. Wimborne's of-- Well he just-- Yeah, just-- - Hello. Ah yes, Richard. No, let me, let-- Right, yes, of course. General Stiles. - General Sti-- All of it? - All of it. Look, just please do it, Anthea, thank you very much. - Yes, Mr. Wimborne. - Wimborne. Tony. Yes, of course. Thank you, so much. (phones ringing) - Sally? - Anthea. - Hi. - What's that? (Cecil muttering) (keys striking) (Cecil muttering) - Oh. Oh! - Come on, Kim, let's go. - [Kim] Wait. (soft mysterious music) (keys striking) Come on, file it. (soft mysterious music) - Please leave it, Kim. It might only be a few hundred. - Please, it won't. Five what? Five what? - Bloody Fort Knox, this is. (keys striking) - [Kim] Ah! - Five million quid. (laughing) (keys striking) - Come on. - [Cecil] Oh. - Come on, come on. (dramatic music) - Ha, let's go. (suspenseful music) - Hm, down there somewhere. - We'll have to swim for it. The water's not gonna be this high up in the main tunnel, is it? - Probably not. - Come on. (splashing) Oh. (splashing) (water lapping) (hard breathing) Kim? Kim? (gasping) Kim? Kim! (dramatic music) (coughing) You okay? You all right? Oh. (Wilmont laughing) - Wilmont? I've just been thinking. It doesn't make sense. - You see, we targeted you. - We? Targeted? I don't understand. - Jeremiah was my pupil in chambers. - We have friends everywhere. We're always recruiting. - [Wilmont] You were such an obvious choice. Your wife, the anonymous donation. Chairman of a dozen boards. - So the American girl? The sculptor? - Sprats. Sprats, to catch a mackerel. It's an old trick, Harry. The hunter always becomes like the hunted. I told you. Tiger's blood. - No, no, transfer. Sorry? Yes, transfer. Shit, do you speak German? - A little bit, here. Hello, hello. (speaking foreign language) - What, what? (speaking foreign language) What, Cliff? - Shut up. (speaking foreign language) (soft mysterious music) (speaking foreign language) - Oh God. - Well. - Cliff. - Kim. Don't be too disappointed. - Oh no. - I'm afraid the 1,600 didn't get through. But the 30 million did.
