Mom! Mom! What I remember mostfrom before, was people's voices... Kind of floating on the wind and laughing. Like everybody was in on something... Like it all mattered somehow. I know what I did and I don't want forgiveness, from you or anybody else. I don't deserve it and, with respect, I'm happy here. Happy? Well, I mean, i think it's right. I think I belong here. I find it interesting that you think that you should determine where you belong. You spent, 21 years, 6 months here at atborough. And prior to that, 1 year, 5 months at wentworthjuvenile facility. Yes, sir, that's correct. And I expect to remain here as sentenced. I'm afraid you don't exactly ha. The board of review is aware of your record here and is prepared to commute your sentencefrom li. There are those who might feel that congratulations are, so congratulations. You're a free man. Sorry. Shit! Hey! Hey, you! Yeah, you! Hold up! Wentworth. You was at wentworth, weren't you? Back in the d. Yeah. Damn, what's up, brother? I thought that you were gone for good. Yeah, well, they... I guess they fixed it. I... I'm sorry, man, I forgot your name. What's your name? Jordan.

Yeah, we was at wentworth toget. Me and him. Wasn't nothing but kids. I read a book that was written. A man said there was 5 steps towards making amends. The first involved acknowledging what you did. The 2nd involved remorse. The 3rd involved making rightwith your neighbo. Like, if you stole his chicken, you'd have to go and bring him another. Only then were you able to go to step 4, which was making it right with god. But it wasn't until step 5 that you could really g. It had to do with being in the same place, in the. Then, as it goes, you'd go and do something different. Only I can't bring abner easley back like he was some stolen chicken. I certainly made sure of that 23 years ago. And I don't believe in some god that's gonna open his arms to me, even if I did. So there goes steps 3 and 4. As for step 5, time makes sure we're never inthe same place twe no matter how much we wish it. Which is why, for me, I know I'll never be redeemed. Manual? Manual? Manual? Manual! Hey. Manual.

I don't know why god made me the way I am, or whoever did it. I'm certainly not proud of who I am. We're all capable of anything. I know that, now. Me, I could have been anything. Taxi!

You're on your own. Miles! My name is John. It might not make any sense, but instead of thinking about what he did, try thinking about what he did for you guys. I mean, that's the important thing, you know. So you're saying this guy was onthe run the whol. He lied to us. Yeah. For real. I think it's kind of cool, though. Dude never said nothingabout who he was. I just assumed he was for real. One thing you can assume is that he was sincere about what he said to you. I. People mess up, you know? What about you?

Like we need another liquorstore around here? Shut up! Crazy, man. So, what happens now? To Adele easley. I keep thinking about what you said, about how your brother abner to youis now just. Well, for 23 years I've been carrying a weight. And for 23 years, I never knew how icould possibl. I thought it would be by making myself known to you. Telling you who I was and apologizing. I had a fantasy that I could help things. As if by doing some number of good things now, it could make up for one very bad thing then. But I think that by telling you who I am, I would only be helping myself. But I'm too weak to carry this weight. And I need you to know how sorry I am. I'm a murderer and a coward and I will always remain these things. I read a book once on redemption. A man said there were 5 steps toward making amends. The first involved acknowledging what you did. The 2nd involved remorse. The 3rd involved making rightwith your neighbo. Only then were you able to go to step 4, which was making it right with god. Only, I can't bring abner easley back, like he's some stolen chicken. I certainly made sure of that 23 years ago. And I don't believe in some god that's gonna open his arms to me, even if I did. So there goes steps 3 and 4. As for step 5, time makes sure we're never inthe same place twe no matter how much we wish it. Which is why, for me, I know I'll never be redeemed. What goes around comes around, motherfucker. Abner. Put the gun down! What the fuck are you doing? Get the fuck out of here. Abner, put the gun down. Don't be stupid. He shot me, right? He shot me! It doesn't matter. Yes, it does! Just put it down! No! He's done! He's dead! It's not worth it, trust me. What are you fucking doing? Abner, put the gun down. As if you'll pull that. Yes, I will. Bullshit! Yes, I will. I'm putting him in the dumpster right now. You shoo! I don't care about him! No. Fuck that. Back off! Manual. Don't fucking come any closer! Listen to me! Get the fuck away from me! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Don't let him get away! Stop! Get the fuck off me! What are you doing? He fucking got away! What the fuck! Shit! Why'd you get involved in this? He was gonna s! Goddamn it! What's your problem? What the hell? What the hell? Shit! Shit! Fuck. Shit! Abner! No, no, no. Abner! Mom? Mom? Abner. Are you ok? Are you ok? Are you ok? I'm ok, mom. God. He jumped in front. Is he ok? I'm sorry. Don't you say a word. Wait here. Keep him warm. Mom! Help! Somebody! Help! Mom! Help me! Manual. Manual. Manual. Manual Jordan. How long have I been in here? 2 days. You saved me. You brought me here. Why? I don't know, manual. Doctor says you're gonna be fine. Some clothes, a little bit of money. I'm not staying. I just needed to see you're ok. See that I didn't waste my energy. And I wanted to say goodbye. Can I come see you? No, please. Please, don't ever come to see me. Ever. This is my town. It's my home. You got the rest of the world. What? I can't. What do you mean, you can't? You've got to. These kids like you. You make them laugh. So? So I think that's important. Yeah, but I don't know anything. The routine... Hell, just make something up. It doesn't really matter. Just stop whining and do it. Just figure it out together. They get you. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Well, neither do I, but you'll thinkof something? Are you coming back? I don't know. You'll be fine. Hey, how are you? It's $15. Is what's-his-name here? No, he's not here anymore.
