[Train noise] [Dramatic music] [Music ends] [Mysterious music] [Phone rings] [Dramatic music] [Foot steps] [Radio] Third to be drawn - number 28. Joined us the weekend before last. There's no milk. Fuck! Why not? 'Cause there isn't none! Because you don't bloody well buy any, that's why. [Radio] You going out tonight? Yeah. You got any pills? No, I haven't been yet. So, can you get us some when you go. How many do you want? A couple. Three. There's a few in the box. You can have them. If you want any more, you'll have to come and get it later, 'cause I'm not coming back. Where? Peckham. [Radio] 3, 10 no, it's alright. Linda'll get us some. [Radio] 30, 41 [radio] And the bonus number is 33. [Radio] Just to remind you, tonight's prize fund is 25 million pounds. [DJ music] Rat! You alright? How you doing? I'm alright. Oh yeah? Where you going? Oh nowhere - just out. - Yeah. Oh. Hey, I've just got the new micro machines version 3 for the PlayStation. You should see it. It's fucking brilliant - makes all the other ones look crap! Yeah. I've got it inside if you wanna have a go? No mate, I've got be somewhere. You are always going out somewhere. You going raving? Maybe later. Oh, wicked, rat! Can I come? Oh, go on! Go on! No, I can't, mate. Why not? I'll help. I'll be really useful. I'll watch your back. Look out for coppers. I don't do it like that. Please. Seriously, I'll be good! I can't, mate, you're too young. Come on rat, I'm only a year younger than you. That's not the point. Well... look, I won't get in the way. I'll walk behind you. Look, Ben, just forget about it. No way. That sucks. Why not? - Look... I don't want some kid all night following me around and scaring all the fucking punters off, do I? Yeah. Okay. Look, I'll see you around, yeah? Yeah, alright. See you around. Wanker! [Mysterious music] Rat. It's Sam. Yeah. You all right? Rat, you've gotta help me out. I'm going out on a major night and I really need to get a hold of your uncle. Which one? Oh yeah. Uncle bill. Nah, sorry Sam, he's not around. I haven't seen him for a bit now. I mean I can generally find the other uncle. You know - the posh one. But I mean, that's a different price range. Yeah. No, I can't stretch to that. Never mind. Gimme a call if you see bill, will you? Hello. Alright, rat? It's Jay. - How you doing? Yeah. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. Not too bad, mate. Look, I was just wondering how things were. Alright as it happens, yeah. Yeah? I was looking for some of that green carpet, wondering if you've still got any left. Yeah, there's still a few metres. But it's an expensive one. You know - it's extra quality. [Music] [Music ends] [Song] The next train departing from dull routine and state controlled food poisoning... Arms trading... And eco-genocide... Is the brain train. - You are 18? - Yeah. Go ahead. [Suspenseful music] So Dylan, right - Dylan is obviously dope. And Florence... She's mushrooms. Why is that then? Well 'cause she's obviously some sort of flower person isn't she, with that fucking great yellow ribbon in her hair. Yeah, but I mean she could be dope as well. No, that's Dylan, right? Dylan's a bloody hippy. Dylan! Yeah, but he'd be better off for like mushrooms or acid. Acid. No, no, no. Acid is... No Zebedee. No you're right, Zebedee, he's speed. But what about dougal, 'cause he was always fucking speeding all over the place? I don't fucking know, do I? It was just something I read, alright? Give us a break! Here, ray, did you hear that? What? All the characters in 'the magic roundabout', right... They're all based on illegal drugs. That is why it's banned. Jesus, can't you think of anything else to talk about? You know, you two are sad fuckers! I mean who gives a shit what some French wankers put in a kiddy's cartoon? Look, how many people have we got in now? I dunno. We haven't finished counting yet. Yeah, well if you stopped wittering on like a couple of old acid heads, we might have had it done by now. Here! Give me some. Can we go and dance now? I'm bored. Yeah. Later. We're missing all the good stuff. Come on. If you wanna go and fucking dance, go and dance. I'm not stopping you. I want you to come with me. I'm working, alright? Later! You're not working. You're just sitting here sniffing loads of Charlie. Hello. I'm counting tickets. Look, you can either stay here with us and keep your mouth shut, you can go and fucking dance, or you can piss off. It's entirely up to you. So what about Brian then? Oh, downers - definitely fucking downers! [Club DJ music] Hi. Have you got any E’s? A guy over there told me you might be able to help. What bloke? I dunno. He's just over there. He's gone. How many d'you want? One each. That's two. A tenner each. Yeah. Fine. Uh, listen - they are alright stuff aren't they? Well, have you done it before? Yeah, we've done it loads of times. You'll be alright then. There's twenty quid. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Yeah. Yeah. But not on the mobie, right? Yeah, sure. In theory fine, but if we're gonna talk details, we've gotta do it face to face. Yeah. Well, come down. It's my fucking party. Animal. Don't you think that's a bit gruesome? I mean if I was to be given a flyer like that, I'd have it on my toes, mate. But then again, what do I know? It's great! Brilliant. Love it. Here, well take it from me. Beggars can't be choosers. Oi, ray! What? Cort's got three geezers at the door. Says one of them knows you, but he isn't on the list. Can I call you back? Who? Says his name's... Gary watts - from some car place. Gary watts? - Oh yeah. He's that fucking wanker who sold me that dodgy beamer. You remember - the one with the broken axle? Not the one that fell in half going round the m25? Yeah, that one. He's a fucking headcase, that bloke! Said he wouldn't replace it. Said he's not responsible for wear and tear - fucker! So I said if he didn't, I'd go round and trash his whole fucking car-lot. Came round the next day - brand new 5 series. He's got a fucking cheek! No, tell him to piss off. Nah, let's let him in, right, and once he's inside we'll take a fucking hacksaw to his back axle or something. No, Des! Tell him to fuck off! Alright. This could be a laugh, you know. Animal... Animal! Check out the door. Could be trouble. Come here. [Music] Sorry mate. You can't come in. What? Why not? You can't come in. But I fucking told you - I know Raymond. Yeah, well maybe he don't remember. What is this fucking shit? He owes me, man. Where is he? Look mate, you ain't coming in, so why don't you just piss off, eh? Don't you tell me to piss off. Don't you fucking tell me to piss off! Look mate, if you want trouble, then you fucking got it, alright? Oh yeah? Ow, my fucking wrist man! My fucking wrist! Aah, you're fucking breaking it, man! Oh, please mate. Leave it out, please! Please! Rat, how you doing, man? Fuck! Fig, don't do that to me! I was hoping I'd find you. It's like... Are you okay on things? Yeah, I'm alright. Alright. Sweet! The guys are over in the corner, right? Can't stay long. Got a spot of business to do. That's why I was hoping I'd find you. Yeah, lemme just get some water. Yeah, yeah. Right, right. So, uh, d'you see sky? What, here? Yeah, saw her over by the front. Said hello to her. She just fucking blanked me. I guess that mate of hers - Janet - must have told her about me. Why? Well, you know I got off with her, like - Saturday before last? Yeah. I mean I was well chuffed. I mean she's fucking alright! So like, we was coming back in the car and Tony and Glen was in the front, right? And me and her was in the back, and I mean she was out of it. I'd been feeding her pills all fucking night. And then she didn't wanna do nothing. So finally I persuaded to give me a blow job, right? And she says, okay, but like, you mustn't cum in my mouth. So I'm like, what am I supposed to say? Fine, no problem. Right? So I says to her, look darling, don't worry, I'm not gonna cum in your mouth. And the silly fucking bitch believes it! So like she starts sucking me off, right? And what happens next? I fucking cum in her mouth like it isn't obvious that's what I was gonna do all along. And then she starts screaming at me. She's giving it like, oh but you promised. And like, you didn't say you would and that. So I says to her, look, love, I'm sorry but it's just one of the occupational hazards of having a fucking cock in your mouth, innit? And then she starts crying. So like that pissed Tony and Glen off. So what can we do? Stopped the car and pushed her out. Fuck knows where we were. Where'd you see sky? Oh, up the other end. Hey boys, look who I found! Now we can get fucking sorted. Figgy mate, will you do me a favour? - What's that? - Shut the fuck up! - Cheers, how's it going? - Alright. You? - Not too bad. - Yeah. Wicked! Y'know, I don't feel like going now, you know that? Figgy says you're working tonight. Oh yeah. Right, figgy! Tell the whole fucking world, why don't you? It's only rat. Rat's alright. Yeah, I know that. But you'll go shooting your mouth off to anyone, and you know it! Rat's alright. Place in Wandsworth, yeah? Fucking office block packed with computers and that. All brand spanking new. Right? Had to go mend one in there the other day. Only bought in last month. Totally new kit. All pentium pros. One security guard. No fucking alarms. You gonna pack something? For some fucking 80-year old who's probably asleep? You must be joking. I don't fancy doing four years inside, mate. Besides, a bat scares them just as much as a shooter - shuts them up just as quick! And knocks them out into outfield! Right out of the fucking stadium, mate. I don't do it for kicks, you know? Not like figgy over there. I have to stop you don't I? I think he'd do it for something to talk about the next day. Hey. Hey, remember when I'd done that guy at the warehouse in croydon? Oh mate, that was fucking wicked! Shut up! That geezer should have been in a wheelchair! - He was a fucking geriatric! - Yeah, yeah, may be. But still he could have called the old bill if I hadn't stopped him. And I didn't hear you thanking me for that. Figgy, mate - you are fucked up in the head, and we all know it. Here, rat... Got any pills, mate? No problem, mate. How many do you want? What d'you reckon, tone? One now and one for after? No way! I'm not going out to some fucking office block with you two tripping your heads off! Well, half now, then. That'll be cool. What're they like, mate? Same batch as Brixton. If you have one now, it won't knock you out. But you'll feel it. Sweet! Who's got the cash? No, no, no, boys, we'll sort it out later, yeah? Watch my back while I get them out. Fuck, man! How many have you got for tonight? Well, you have to buy them in a load, don't you? Otherwise you get a shit price, and you get ripped off. You've got to be careful, you know, mate. One or two to friends is sweet. But if Raymond catches you dealing in here, he'll kill you! I mean it! He's a serious fucking man! Or animal... Have you seen that fella? Now, there is a fucking loon! He'd fuck you up just for looking at him funny. Yeah, but I'm careful. Anyway, he'd never catch me. His blokes are too fucking stupid! You could deal under their noses, and they wouldn't notice. Besides, I'm only a kid, aren't I? Oh yeah. And you think that will stop animal, do you? Look, I've done enough now. I'm gonna call it a night soon. Just be careful. That's all. I'll do one more circuit, yeah? See you around. - Take care mate. - Cheers for the gear, alright? I'll sort you out later, right? Hey... and tell sky that her mate gives really great head! Come by later when we're done, yeah? We'll be at my mum's. [DJ music] You alright? I'm going to the toilet. - No, wait for me. I'll see you outside. What's up with her then? Oh, I dunno. I'll tell you later. I've been looking for you all over. Oh yeah. So, have you got any pills? Oh, I thought you might be looking for me for other reasons. Rat, I'm into men, not boys. Babe, believe me - this is all man. Oh, yeah? Prepared to prove that? Sky, you're just a tease. You know that? Yeah. But you love it. So, got any pills? So - got any cash? No. American express? Visa? Left my gold card at home. Well, how're you planning to pay for them, then? Well, I dunno. I could pay it to you next time. Oh, like you always fucking do. Oh go on rat, please! I'll be really nice to you. Sky, you are so full of shit! This is the fifth time you've done this to me. And I've not even had a snog yet. Well, maybe tonight you will. And maybe tonight I won't. I know you like me. Figgy told Janet. Sky, you're so sad! You're probably still a virgin anyway. So maybe you could be my first. Sky, I'm a business. You're gonna fucking bankrupt me! For two pills? It can't be a very stable business. For fuck's sake! Here! Thanks. What are you doing afterwards? Oh, nothing. Got to sort a couple of things out. Find me! Maybe. I'd better go in there and see Janet now. I'll see you later. Alright. [DJ music] What the fuck's going on now? What the fuck's happening? Oi, ray, there's some fucking heavy shit going on, man. Some fucking girl's collapsed. She fell off the platform. She's just a fucking kid! Oh fuck! Yeah, well now they're calling for a fucking ambulance! No, no fucking way! We don't want to get the cops down here. Des, grab the stuff! Animal. Get the guys! What about her? No. There's not enough room in the car. [Footsteps] [Mysterious music] [Indistinct chatter] [Indistinct chatter] Oi, animal, watch yourself up there, mate. Oi! Do you want mustard on your burgers? Just ketchup. We're at the snacks wagon. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Alright. Yeah. I'll see you in a few minutes. Yeah, fuck! That was Newton. He's coming over to meet us. Says there's something I ought to know about. He's pissed off. What's he want? I don't fucking know. He wouldn't tell me on the mobile. Jesus Christ! Last night was a fucking disaster. Why didn't you just Chuck 'em out? No way, man. She was... she was puking and shaking all over the place. The stupid little bitch had been at it for hours. Everybody knew it. Fuck! We still got the cash. Oh yeah. Yeah. And how many fucking people are gonna turn up to the next party after this? No problem. No problem. Right? Cause all we're gonna have to do is change the name, right? As if it never happened. Hello? It was a fucking disaster! So how's your tummy then, mate? I dunno. I think the wanker broke a rib or something. [Laugh] Raymond. Alright, mate? Look, I'm sorry about all that shit back there. We just had to get the fuck out. I know you would've done the same. Would've been nice if you told us what was going on before you pissed off. It was a fucking nightmare. Yeah. Like I say, I'm sorry. Alright? The whole thing was a fucking nightmare. Yeah, right! You panicked, man. That's what happened. And I understand we weren't the only people dealing tonight. What are you talking about? Like I say - quite a few people say they bought pills tonight, but not from us. Who? Some kid - rat or something. He's been at a couple of our parties doing small time for mates. We threw him out once - gave him a bit of a kicking. Seems like he's trying to go big time. What? At my party? That's right. And not only was he on my patch, but apparently he's the one who sold the stuff to that girl. So, fuck knows what sort of shit he's been pushing. I'll fucking kill him. Where's he from? We're trying to find out who knows him, where he hangs out. Alright. Well, if you do, do us a favour, let us sort him out. Oh, come on. This is the first party of mine that hasn't gone so fucking smooth. You know that. Have I ever given you any trouble before? So you'll sort him? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I can think of ways. [Banging on the door] Yeah. Yeah. Who's that? Rat. Hey, man. Morgan, them pills you gave me - I need to know, were they alright? What was in them? What do you mean? Sold one to this girl tonight... And she was sick. I mean really sick. She might even be fucking dead for all I know. Whoa, whoa. That's heavy... heavy, man! These are the fucking pills. What's in them? Will you chill out? I can't deal with you when you're like this. Are they shit? Have I been selling shit? I don't do shit man. I wouldn't do that to you. I mean, we're friends, you know. I mean, what kind of a guy do you think I am? Well, I don't know. Well, look, I wouldn't do that to you, man. I can't... You didn't see her! She was in a fucking bad way. Well, maybe she was allergic to it or something. Maybe she had a... bad reaction. It happens sometimes. Look, why don't you just come in, chill out, skin up. Come on. I tell you what. I tell you what. I'll buy it back from you. Okay? No problem. I don't want you to be unhappy about it. I don't want you to have any problems at all. Alright? I don't want any bad feelings between us. I'm making some tea. Do you want some? No. I'm alright. Well, just sit down. Chill out, man. [Trippy music] Try it. Fuck, that's good shit! Where's it from? Try and guess! Fucking hell, I don't know. Holland? Morocco? Where? Slough. No way! Hmm. That's right. Slough? A lot of interesting things come from slough. G. M. C. It's grown indoors, under lights. Genetically mutated cannabis. They spray it with stuff. Actually, it's a sort of weed killer, but in really small doses. And it makes it stronger. Then they take off shoots and plant them. And with each generation, it gets stronger and stronger. You can measure the THC content, and it increases according to a logarithmic curve. But imagine, in the future, I mean, with what they can do now - imagine in 20 or even 10 years from now, cannabis with a THC content of 80 or 90. Or maybe they'll just refine pure THC. It would kill you. Yes. But nevertheless, what a way to go. I suppose. Imagine... The sensation of death when distorted in such a manner. Aldous huxley insisted on taking LSD on his deathbed, and expired tripping somewhere among the planets. That must have been somewhat enlightening. I know this is good stuff, but why not try something with a bit more kick? I think we could have some real fun. [Dramatic music] Yeah. Yeah. Fucking excellent! [Radio] A radiance that seemed to be forever attracting the glances... Where? Yeah. Yeah. I know. [Radio] ...Somehow sensed the future greatness... No, no. That'll do me. We can get him from there. Yeah alright. And don't worry. There won't be any more trouble. [Radio] The prince stopped... I will mate, and cheers! [Radio] Little did she know that this moment would shape her... Bluey, get this shit off! We're gonna do ourselves a spot of rat catching. [Laugh] Hold it in as long as you can. Did you get a hit? Good - was it? Yeah. Good. It's pure. You can't mix it with dilutants. It has to form a crystal. That's the process of making it. They take out all the impurities. That's why you don't get a comedown off it. No impurities. That's good! Stretching - you can feel every muscle. That's good. [Tense music] [Door opens] Shithole! [Glass smashing] [Screaming] [Smashing noises] [Screaming] It frees you. No rules. Total freedom. It's all okay. You can do whatever you want. It's all okay. It's all right. Whatever you want. It's okay. You should try everything. Try it. Just relax. Get into it. It's okay. Don't worry. It's all right. Fuck off! This is weird. This is all too fucking weird. You're all just fucking sick! Hey, hey, hey. Cool it, man. You don't have to do anything you don't wanna do. I just wanna get the fuck out of here. But what about the pills? [Footsteps] [Panting] [Song] Are you children smoking pot? [Tense music] [Sniffs] That was good. I don't think I've had so much fun since my fucking old man died. [Laugh] Those plastic baths are shite though, mate, I tell you. Not like your classic British enamel bath. There's a fucking bath. Mind you fucking heavy - used to hate it when we had to put them in. Fucking break your back, boy. Here, who wants some of this? [Sniffs] Oi. What if someone called the old bill? We made a fuck load of noise. I thought we were gonna stay here until he got back. Yeah, I know. Just like how long we're supposed to stay here for? I mean, what if someone did call plod? Right? Well, you got any better ideas, fucking Einstein? Here, who stamps 'U’s on their pills then? Eh? Look, Bluey. You know sometimes you not just a fucking pretty face. [Music] [Song] Are you children smoking pot? [Music ends] [Foot steps] Oh fuck! What have you been up to? What the fuck have you done? Shit! The whole place... Everywhere! They've even smashed the bathroom. Who were they? How the fuck should I know? I know it's something to do with you because I saw them driving away in a fucking beamer. It's not even like they've taken anything. They've just trashed the place. What the fuck have you done? Nothing. Don't gimme that! What's going on? This place tonight... This girl got ill, and the party broke up. That's all I know. Were you dealing? Yeah a bit, yeah. At someone elses gig! Are you fucking mad? I didn't know they'd catch me, did I? Oh no - they only come and trash my place. That's all, you stupid cunt! How'd you know it was them? Who else was it then? Who else was it? I let you stay here in my place with your filth and your fucking pills... You never turn them down, do you? And then you go and get my place trashed. My place! This is my fucking place! I mean, look at it! This is all I've got. I can't even call the cops. I didn't know they'd find out where I lived. Of course they found out where you live, you stupid... Oh yeah! You take the money, right? Didn't ya? You're too fucking lazy to get off your fat ass. Just as long as you don't have to give a fuck what I'm up to. I could get fucking killed. And all you give a shit about your poxy flat. Well, fuck you! This is my fucking place. [Panting] [Panting] They trashed my place. [Music] What's that one then? Compaq - pentium 133 - clean hard disk... Serial numbers off the keyboard, case and monitor. I'm just sorting out the motherboard. Figgy! How many times do I have to tell you to wear your fucking wristband if you're gonna mess about with chips? Done it hundreds of times. Yes. And how many chips do you fuck up? What are those? It's a ram. That's not a a fucking ram chip. What is it? How am I supposed to know now you've taken it off the fucking motherboard? It could be a fucking Nintendo chip. Tone, get him something else to do, will you? He's driving me fucking mad. Yeah, I can still get them out faster than you. That's no good if you fuck 'em up! Figgy! Grab some meths and get any repair labels off. Ah, that sucks! I get all the fucking crap jobs. [Knock at the door] Quiet! One fucking word outta you, figgy - just one... It's all over, lads. Ah, rat, fuck, man! I thought you were the fucking plod! Shit! Nice one boys! I nearly put the soldering iron through the fucking pentium chip. Fucking hell! This was all one place? Yeah. Piece of piss! One security guy about 90. Fast asleep. He's gonna have a fucking shock when he wakes up. What are you doing now? Cleaning 'em up. So no-one can trace them. It's a compaq. They get the best prices, but they're fucking tricky. You see, most computers, you can just scrape off the serial number, but compaq pass a current through it, and if you scrape it off, the whole fucking lot won't work. So you have to bypass it. Shit! I could do that, only they make me clean the labels off, a fucking crap job. How's your evening, mate? Raymond's trashed my place. What? I just come from there. He's trashed the whole fucking lot - it's all smashed up. That'd be animal. He's a fucking... animal. Figgy. You know you never even fucking met animal. What's going on? Why'd they trash your place? Well after you left, yeah - this girl got sick and everyone panicked. It was fucking chaos. What's that got to do with you? Well, I sold her the pill. Shit! I hope he didn't follow you here. Shut it, figgy! What are you gonna do? You can stay here if you like. Oh, cheers, mate. Here, get the case off those computers for us, will you? Hey, hey, hey! How come he gets to take the cases off, and I have to fucking clean the labels? Figgy! [Music] Jesus Christ! Fucking stay where you are! Who's Morgan? I said, who's Morgan? You. So what the fuck's going on here mate? Having a little party? Kiss chase? You know. - Postman's knock? I don't know. If you ask me, it's all a bit fucking sick. What do you say, animal? Animal here - bit old fashioned - into all that morality shit, you know - catholic - doesn't really approve of all this sexual deviance, do you, animal? What do you guys want? You supply pills, right? And from what I can gather, not very good pills at that. So, who are you supplying them to? Anybody who wants them. Just a few to private customers. Yeah. Well, one of your little private fucking customers is dealing on my patch. Who? Some kid called rat. Ring any bells? Oh, he's only a boy. Whatever! He has fucked me over. What'd you want him for? Well, just like to show him a little discipline, you know? That's what kids need. Now where are we gonna find him? I, I dunno. I think you do. He doesn't... he doesn't come up here very often. I dunno where... Morgan! Have you been taking drugs? I think you need to sober up a bit, mate. Then you might remember. I think what you need... Is a nice cup of tea. No, no, no. Please don't. No. No. Milk? No. [Laughing] Alright. Alright. I've got his pager number. I'll give it to you. But that's all I've got. So what's the number, then? 0839 437927. Thank you. [Coughing] So don't fuck with me again! [Makes gun noise] Let's get the fuck out of here. So then, like, she grabs my dick, pulls it out and goes, nah, not in there. In there! And then she sticks it up her fucking ass. Mind you, I'm not complaining. Whatever turns her on! A geezer I know... Says what turned him off anal is when he pulled his dick out, and found a piece of a sweet corn on the end. Believe me, some birds love it. If you fuck 'em up the ass, they can play with their pussies round the front at the same time. [Laugh] So how about you then, rat? Have you done it? Rear entry? No. No, not yet. How about sky? Wouldn't she let you? Sky's alright. Hope she's better than that fucking slapper mate of hers. Figgy, if you were any more full of shit, mate, you're fucking trousers would fall down. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Really funny! So, are you seeing her then? Oh, you know. She's older than me. Don't let it put you off, mate. If you're old enough to get it up, you are old enough. Besides, maybe she likes the younger man. Dunno. I was supposed to meet her tonight, but that went fucking pear-shaped. And I don't know about her. I dunno if she's just after my pills. It's like that night in croydon - that never turned out to be anything good, did it? That was a fucking mad night! Ah, mate. That was a wicked fucking night, man. They were wicked pills. They shut down your entire nervous system. Figs, if they shut down your entire nervous system, you'd fucking die. Yeah, well, that's what the guy said. So let me get this straight - this bloke offers you pills - says they shut down your entire nervous system, and you fucking buy one. No. I bought two. Figgy you're the fucking end, mate! You really are. [Pager pings] Fucking hell! This is this poncy fucker in Mayfair. I get him Charlie and shit. He's been paging me all night. You got some bugle? Only enough for him. Ah, come on, man. Let's cut it. Does anybody know 0370513991? No. That's fucking weird! I only gives this number to people I know. Maybe someone's using a wrong pager number. Or maybe they're not phoning from home. You know - a phone box or someone else's gaff. It's a mobile number. Someone's borrowed a mate's mobile. Yeah. What if it ain't though? Don't do no harm in finding out, does it? I dunno. It's been a fucking mad night. Dial that number. It stops them from doing 1471 on you. What's that then? - 141. Stick it in then dial. Here you are. Is it ringing? Hello? Hello. Who is it? Are you rat? Who's asking? You are fucking dead! Yeah? I know where you are, and I'm coming to get you. And when I get you, I'm gonna fucking kill you. Slowly, painfully. To start with, I'm gonna cut off your balls and shove them down your fucking throat. Oh, fuck! - Who is it? - Who do you think? Raymond! Said he knows where I am and he's gonna come and get me. Oh, fuck, lads! How would he know where you are? And even if he does, why would he warn you? He knows you'd just fuck off. He's full of shit! He's just trying to scare you, man. Hey, what if... What if he found out? Maybe someone squealed. I'd better go. Where are you gonna go? You can't go home. I dunno. I'll think of something. Shit, man! This is really fucking heavy shit. He could fucking kill you, man. Cheers, fig! I just wish I could do more to help you, mate. Tone, would you sell me your gun? I'd ask if I can borrow it, but you might not get it back. And I've got cash and I'll give you a good price. It's not the money, mate. What you gonna do with it? I dunno. Nothing I hope. But just in case. Believe me, mate. You don't wanna get into that. Oh Tony, you know what they're like. If they catch me, they will fucking kill me. Come on then. Cheers, mates. Take it easy, mate, alright? Stay cool. Yeah? [Footsteps] Shit! Is it loaded? No, there's five in the clip. Is that all? This is serious fucking shit - do you know that? If the old bill catch you with this, you'll go down! Do you understand me? Okay. Do you know how to load it? I'll show you. [Suspenseful music] Rat, what the fuck are you doing here? I wanted to see you. At three in the morning - are you nuts? And you nearly woke dad up. If he found you, he'd have fucking thrown a fit. I thought you must still be awake. I was. I couldn't sleep. I think I'm still up from that pill. I can't believe you just turned up at my flat at three in the morning. You're mental! What do you wanna see me for anyway? I dunno. I guess... I guess it was stupid. That's great! You come around my flat at three in the morning, get me out from the bed, and you don't even know why. How can I get you outta bed? You just said you was already awake. Oh, rat, fuck it! I'm going back to bed. - No, sky. Don't! Why? Please. You got a fag? How was the party? What do you mean? I had to leave right after I spoke to you. Janet was sick. The silly bitch had taken a pill earlier and then was drinking vodka and oranges all night. I had to take her home. Her parents freaked! You know the deal. Oh, it was alright. You didn't really miss much. Some girl got ill, and everyone pissed off. So, where have you been? Oh, around. Just come from tone's. Oh, so you heard about Janet last weekend? Yeah. She's so stupid - that girl. Still, they shouldn't have treated her like that. Yeah, I know. I reckon they're sorry though. Yeah, right! Did you... Really wanna see me? Yeah. Why? Sky! No, why? I wanna know. You know. - No I don't. I just... I wanted... I just... just to talk. Talk? That's not a very guy thing to do. Don't you know you're just meant to shag us and fuck off? You're not actually meant to talk to us. Rat, I'm sorry. Of course we can talk. I'm just not used to it, that's all. Come here. Come on. I know just the place. So, do you do this often? What? Bring boys here. Rat, what the fuck do you think I am? Sorry. I'm not like Janet. I don't do things like that. Alright? Actually if you must know, you're the first person I've brought here. I'm sorry. You dunno what it means - me letting you come here. No one comes here. This is like... Well, it's special. How come? Oh, just stuff. No, tell me. I used to come here all the time, on my own. It's when my parents were going through a bit of a bad patch. Well... my dad was off shagging some tart from his office and my mum found out. You know the deal. Yeah, I know. And this is where I used to come - when it got bad at night. They were shouting and that. It's really cool at night. If you get right in, you can't even hear the traffic. It's just... it's just cool. I wouldn't expect you to understand though. No. No. It's cool. Yeah? Why do they call you rat? I dunno. Guess it's what I am. A rat? I dunno. I didn't make it up. Rats aren't all bad, you know. They're smart. People don't realize that. And they're clean. And if a baby rat's parents die, another rat will just, like, come along and take it in - treat it like its own. That's pretty cool. Fuck! How'd you know all that? Cheers. Did about it in biology. Cheers. And in Chinese astrology, a rat is meant to be busy and energetic. They're really good at business. They're loyal and loving, but they're not very romantic. Mozart was a rat, and so was prince Charles. Shit! You're like a fucking encyclopedia. And you just know all that? Well, I looked that little bit up. When? Tonight. Why? Dunno. Excellent! Come on! Sky! Come on! Sometimes they leave the fountains on at night. It's really cool. Come on! This is what I do. It feels fucking good! [Romantic music] Rat! Don't! Why? I dunno. It just don't feel right, that's all. Please. Why do you do what you do? What do you mean? Well, you know, dealing and stuff. I dunno. I suppose it's just what I do. Yeah, but you could give up if you wanted to. Nobody makes me do it. That's not what I meant. I mean if you wanted to give up, you could, couldn't you? Why should I? Well, you know it's wrong. Sky, how can you buy pills off me, and then tell me it's wrong? I know. I suppose I shouldn't. But I mean you're not exactly gonna give up immediately tomorrow if I didn't, are you? I just... Wouldn't want to see you get in trouble, that's all. What else would I do? Anything. Anything you want. It's all right for you to say. You're smart, and you go to school. You've got parents who work and stuff, and give you money. That's not the point. There's this animal, right - called a sea squib. It lives in the sea like a small squid or something. And when it's born, it has a brain and everything. And it's first job is to find somewhere to live. So it swims around trying to find a cool dark rock or something. And when it gets there, it clings on with its little tentacles or whatever. And it stays there. It stays there for the rest of its life. And you know the first job it has, once it's found a place to live? It actually eats its own brain. 'Cause it don't need it no more. First thing I thought when I read that was - that's my mum. And I decided - I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna work in quiksave and marry some fucking geezer who cheats on me, and have loads of screaming kids. No fucking way! What happened to that girl tonight? What? You said some girl got ill. I don't know. Did she have to go to hospital? I dunno. Don't you care? No. Why should I? Dunno. Just wondered. It's her own fault. Do you care about anything? I care about me. Apart from you? Like what? Anything, anybody? No. It's just - you can't. I mean you can't rely on anybody. There's only one person who'll always be there. And that's you. So you gotta look after yourself. And if you do that all right, then you'll be alright. You just can't never rely on anybody. You could rely on me. Sky, you don't know me. Sky. Could I stay at your place tonight? With my parents, are you kidding? I'll sneak out the window in the morning. No, seriously rat. If they found you, they'd fucking kill me. I thought as much. What do you mean? Well, you say you care about me, but that's just a load of shit. That's really unfair. No it ain't, sky. You won't shag me. You won't let me stay with you. And then you say I'm not supposed to sell you pills, and it's wrong and all that, and you still take them, and now you're trying to say you care? Is that why you came here? What? Is that why you came? 'Cause you wanted a quick shag and somewhere to stay? What's wrong with that? I don't fucking believe you. I don't fucking believe you! It's all crap, isn't it? Sky, why are you making such a big deal over nothing? Oh fuck off! Do you think I'm fucking stupid? I thought you were different from figgy and all that lot, but you're not, are you? You're just the same! I suppose you'll go back to them now and tell them how I wanked you off in the park, and you'll have a fucking good laugh, won't you? Sky, I'm not gonna do that. Oh, just shut up. Just shut the fuck up! Come here. - Get your hands off me! Just fuck off! Oh, sky, wait! Sky! [Footsteps] [Indistinct] Mum, it's me. Robert. What the hell are you doing here? I've just come to visit. In the middle of the bloody night? What have you been taking? Mum. I haven't. I just wanted somewhere to sleep. No way. No, no, not again. Just for tonight. I'll be gone in the morning. What, your sister finally kicked you out, has she? What'd you do - steal off her the way you did off me? No. I'm just kind of in trouble. That's all. Oh, that makes a change. What about your friends? They fed up with you and all? No, I can't stay with them. No. I'm not having it. You made your bed. Now you can lie in it. Son! Dad. You should have thought about all this before you buggered off. It's just for tonight. I'll be gone in the morning. No. This is a decent house now. There's no lying, no stealing, no drugs, no visits from the police. I've got your sister to think of now. You might wanna throw your life away, but I've got her to think of. Rat! You alright? Have you come home? No love. He's going now. Sheila! No. I'm not going through all that again. I don't see why I should. I've already had to deal with losing a son once, and I'm not having it again. This is a decent home now. Come on, love. How are you, son? Okay. How about Debbie? She's just usual. Y'know I think you've grown. You're quite a young man now, aren't you? Can I... She didn't really mean all that just now, you know? She was gutted when you left. You was always her favourite. She never got on with Debbie. I think she blames herself for... You know. Yeah, dad. Look, I'd better go. Yeah, yeah, sure. But listen, give her a call sometime. Eh? She'd appreciate it. I know she would. Okay. You got somewhere to go? You're gonna be all right? Yeah, I'll be fine. Right. Uh, I don't... I don't suppose you've... You've got any spare... You could... you know, things have been a bit tight lately. Thanks. You're not a bad lad really, are you, eh? Why don't we meet up some time and... Maybe go down the pub or something? Like the old days. Maybe go and see Chelsea play? You still a supporter? No. No. Not really. Cheers anyway though. Look, I'll see you around, yeah? Yeah, mind how you go. [Pager pings] [Phone rings] Hello. Alright, Richard? It's rat. Where the fuck have you been? I've been paging you all night. Yeah, I'm sorry man. It's just been a bit of a mad night. I ain't been able to get to the phone. Uh, do you still want some gear? Yeah, definitely. Right. I will be round in about 10 minutes. Are you sure? I don't wanna be fucked around again. Oh no, no. No problem man. I'll be on my way, yeah? Okay. Well, I'll see you in 10 minutes. Cheers. [Dramatic music] Come on in. Anna, you might put some fucking clothes on. We have a visitor. Sit down. So, rat, let's see what you've got for me, eh? It's good gear. Really clean. The bloke does pop stars and stuff, so it's gotta be good. Okay. And the usual price? Well that's two grams. I wouldn't normally knock off any for two. But as I kept you waiting, how's about I knock off a tenner, yeah? That'll make it 120. Okay. Though we're going to have to do something about this situation, rat. I mean, we can't have things carrying on like tonight, can we? I mean - when I call you, the whole point is I need to know you can come. I don't want to have to wait all night. Look, I really appreciate you coming round at this time, but seriously, it's not as if it's the first time it's happened, is it, mate? Yeah, I know. I'm really sorry. But tonight was really mad. There was some real heavy shit going down. It won't happen again. [Inhales] Good! 'Cause obviously, you know I'd like to carry on dealing with you, but if you can't give me the time, I might have to find someone else to help me out. Obviously I wouldn't want to. As you know, I've always been happy with your gear. But anyway, I know you'll do what you can. So... how's business, rat? What's this trouble you've been having? Oh, just some bloke called Raymond - runs gigs down south London. I had a bit of run-in with him at a party tonight. That's all. Where was the party? Some warehouse just off old Kent rd. Whereabouts? Just before the railway lines, and just by McDonald's. Oh I know it. It used to be an engineering works. A guy I knew bought that whole block - was going to turn it into a residential development, then the silly fucker lost all his money in offices. So that's what he is doing with it now, is it? It's a wicked place for a rave. Well, who knows, rat? Maybe one day when one of my places becomes vacant we could have a couple of raves. You could run 'em for me. Would you like that? That'd be good. Well as I said, I've got lots of plans. Lots of plans. Anna! Anna's had a hard day at the health spa, haven't we, Anna? All those massages and aromatherapy wearing you out, eh? Fuck off! Why, I suppose you'll want to be getting off. I'd better go and get you your money. Actually I was gonna ask a favour. What? I've got be over Kensington first thing in the morning. It's hardly worth me going all the way back home and then coming back again. So I was wondering if I could crash here for a couple of hours. Right. Well, I don't see why not. ...given our new agreement that you'll give me priority. Yeah, yeah, that's fine. This run-in you've been having with Raymond - is it to do with this stuff? Yeah, kind of. I'm not going to have any trouble, am I? No, no. No way. Besides, I'll be gone first thing in the morning. Okay. Anna, are there any sheets on the spare bed? [Tense music] There's not going to be any trouble is there? I can't afford to have trouble here. I just want to have a talk with him, that's all. Just want to sort things out. As long as that's clear. Alright. And you take him with you? - Yeah. And you can guarantee me 50 a gram? I told you that's not a problem. Rat! What the fuck are you doing? Shut up, you fucking lying cunt! What the fuck are you doing with a gun? What the fuck's he doing here? Look rat, calm down! It's not a problem. You told me you had some trouble with a guy called Raymond. So I thought maybe I could help sort things out. I called my mate at the warehouse, got the number, and gave Raymond a call. It turns out all he wants to do is talk to you. He's been leaving messages just like me, but you never return them. Oh yeah, what did he offer you? Cheap coke? Look, rat. You're being fucking stupid. All he wants is to do a deal with you. Isn't that right? Yeah, yeah. I just wanna sort things out. So let's start by putting the gun down. No fucking way! You don't understand. No one wants to hurt you. Huh, yeah, right! Come on. This is stupid. Give me the gun! Stay where you are! No. You give me the gun right now. I'll fucking shoot you. You don't understand - he'll fucking kill me! I think you've just had too many pills this evening. Come on, give it here! I'll fucking shoot you! No, I don't think you will. [Gun fire] My finger. Jesus fucking Christ! My fucking finger! You shot my fucking finger off! Jesus fucking Christ. My finger! You've shot my fucking finger off. [Laugh] Jesus fucking Christ! Where's my finger? [Laugh] [Suspenseful music] It's him! Oh fuck! [Rock music] [Music ends] [Suspenseful music] [Gun fire] [Gun fire] [Train noise] [Calm choral music]
