Patrick had a vague feeling. Something was about to happen. How could he tell his parents, that the malevolent things Were all around? How could he tell his parents, that the malevolent things Were all around? In the ether and in each speck of dust. Patrick had always seen these things. And always had it seemed that he alone knew about them. And so... On the evening of the seventh day, He could feel their imminent arrival. Something in the breeze of twilight whispered: "It's going to happen tonight." The following day, when his mother opened the door, There was absolutely nothing there. The trail of Patrick Willian Wards' urine led to an empty closet. Bathed in the darkness of his last night. The end. Wow. Gosh. Here we go. That's one of his best. - Mother, you say that every single time. - Yeah. But this time I mean it. Really? I was fascinated, captivated... scared. It was like... Lovecraft. - I know. Too much like him, huh? - No. I haven't completely found my voice yet. Yeah, that's what it is! Vera! "Mother, my sister is a freak. - Something new, please. - No! Beth, honestly, I can't wrap my mind around how you spend days, writing this piece of crap that ends with piss on a carpet. You would not understand. What the hell are your stories supposed to mean? They're supposed to be scary! What's scary is having you for a sister, but good luck finding a boyfriend. Calm down, Vera I don't speak french! Keep writing, Beth. What if I'm not good? enough? You are good enough, Beth. You're only saying that because you're my mom. What's that? What the fuck? Come on, Vera, have manners. Without French, mom! Quite a vintage car you've got there! Mom and I love old things. - You're just passing through? - No. I mean... we're moving here. Into Aunt Clarice's house. Auntie Clarice? She lives around here? I'm not sure exactly. I mean, she's dead. She was my mother's cousin's sister-in-law or something. Oh Clarice Jourdain! That coocking little french lady, who had that place... Oh Damn it! For Christ's sake! Almost got my nail polish in here for at least a week! What's the story for it, Miss Jourdain. My name is Keller. Whatcha doing? What is that? A story you wouldn't like. How did you know? There is nobody here? Oh God, it stinks. She'll be right back. Oh my God, I look hideous. Okay, what's the story about? Some guy's been breaking into people's homes. Murdering the parents and sparing the daughters. One is about your age. Uhm. and..? He stays in the house with her. Along with the parent's dead bodies. - You made that up. - Girls! Let's go? Jesus Christ. It's Rob Zombie's house. She's gonna like it. It's not bad. It's like an extension of her brain. You've got to be kidding me. The bedrooms are upstairs. It smells like old ladies in here! It smells what molds here. Yeah, that's what I said. Look all these dolls! Clarice never let me play with them. What was Aunt Clarice's deal? Is it working? No! Bingo! Aren't you going to get up this antique writer bullshit? Just use a laptop! Aren't you going to get up this antique writer bullshit? Just use a laptop! Never. God, it's like a flea market in here. You think she bought all this for herself? Yeah, old ladies love that kind of crap. A Chinese puzzle-box. What? It is more than a mirror. It's actually a box, I've read about these. There's gotta be a secret button somewhere. Jesus! So, you like it? No! Vera, careful with that. Who would wanna buy one of these? Honey? Baby? Beth? Beth! I'm okay. Oh sweetie. Of course you're okay. That's why you looked so pale. What's wrong with her? Nothing. She's like you, now. Great. You you do have a great sense of timing. Vera! Is she alright? Oh, so now you ask. You could have stayed in and helped her out. Why bother? And you rushed to her rescue anyways. I don't get why she would write these stories if she fall apart at the first sight of blood. She's afraid of flying. She's afraid of boys. She is afraid of her own freaking shadow! The other day when I was packing I found something you'll never believe. I'm not into games, Vera. An interview. With her, Mom. Several pages, all typed up like it was a magazine. She made the all thing up! Like, in it, she is a famous writer and this journal is asking all these questions about her books. She needs a reality check, Mom. It's nice to know that you do love your sister up for all. I know you're angry about leaving your boyfriend behind. Whatever, Mom. And quit wearing makeup! Fuck you! Piece of shit. I know you love her more! Beth. Beth. Beth. Fucking Beth. Oh shit. Mom! Where did your antique lamp go? I'm upstairs. Who is your favorite writer? I know. Your antique lamp! Where does it go? In your room. You hear me? Yes! Hey! Go easy on the door. Enjoying my bed, are you? This is yours. And this is yours too. That ton of shit is not staying in my room. Take it! Will it kill you to be a little nicer to your sister? It might. That's what I thought. Not mine. It's an old house. God mom! It's my room! Go help Lovecraft junior. Jesus! Lower! Jane? What? Hello? Hello? Jane? I can't hear you. Mom? Did you hear that? Mom!? No! He just wants to play with dolls. Don't look at me. Listen to me, Beth. You have to go. Go. Run away baby! Run away. No! No! Mom! No! - No! - Beth! Look here, Beth! Baby, baby, come here. Hey, hey, hey. It's okay Beth. You're okay. You're okay. Hey. - I was in the basement. - I know. I know. With Vera. It's over now. Okay? It was so real. It was a long time ago, Beth. It's a beautiful morning on CO1 Sit back and enjoy Chicago's classical music station. Yes? It's Jerry. Hey, Jerry. No. I'm sorry, she can't.

As she very rarely makes television appearances. Elizabeth Keller. Oh it's such a pleasure to meet you, Elizabeth. It's a pleasure for me too. "Incident in a Ghost Land" Is your most personal book so far. And a kind of tribute to your family? Yes that's true. What happened to you and your sister, when you were teenagers? Are you asking if the book is autobiographical? What I'm saying, Elizabeth, Is that it just seems so real. The details are so intense. That I guess the question is: "Why write this book?" To keep from going insane. Truly? I mean, Is there a better reason to write? No. She would not shut up about Vera and I. I got defensive. I'm sure everyone noticed. It's not this bad. You know, with your mysterious way You call the shots. You're only saying that because you're my biggest fan. Shit. You're right! I'm gonna take Harlequin up to bed. Are you sure you wanna watch this all over again? Take a note from your son look how much he cares. He's not going to go to bed. Wearing this. Why not? He loves this costume. I told you, they love you. Hello? Hello? - Hello? - Beth! Please, you have to come back! - Vera? - Come back! - Is Mom there with you? - They're here! Vera, listen to me. You're not hearing me, Beth! I hear you! Don't leave me alone, Beth! Is Mom there? Vera..? Your mom is with her obviously, right? She has to be. It's busy. Okay, you can just try again. Are you sure about this? I don't know. It could be nothing. Just one of Vera's delusions, but... Mom isn't answering her phone. And I'm having those dreams again Something's not right. I understand, but... They never should have stayed in that house. It's not helping Vera. She should be in an hospital. Alright. You call us when you get there. I will. Take care of yourself Here? Are you sure? Yes. Mom? Mom? Mom? Beth? Oh baby doll! What are you doing here? Why didn't you tell me you were coming? Vera called me last night. She was screaming in the phone, and I got disconnected I tried calling back but I couldn't get through. And I didn't know what was happening. I didn't even know she used the phone. Everything's okay? Yes. She's resting. I've missed you so much. You look beautiful. You haven't changed at all. The house looks exactly the same, Mom. Well...

And I'm going to be able to redo the whole house. Oh really? And I'm going to be able to redo the whole house. Mom, haven't you been getting the money I send you? Sure I have. Oh, Beth. I didn't mean it like that. Mom, If it is not enough, just tell me. I don't even know why I've said that. You're already spoiling me. I'm your daughter and I can do that. I'm not spoiling you. I... I'm your daughter and I can do that. I'm not spoiling you. I... Oh sweetie! I'm sorry, I overreacted. Beth... You're not mad at me? Why would I be mad? Because I left you here all alone with Vera. Beth, look at me. You didn't abandon me. You left because had your own life to live. That's profoundly natural. Understood? Let dry those tears. That's my girl. Let's have a toast.
