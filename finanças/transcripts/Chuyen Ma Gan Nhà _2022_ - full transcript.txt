When the night falls, otherworldly spirits manifest intensely, from the corner of small alleys, old houses or abandoned apartment buildings. They can be in the form of the lady on a sugarcane juice cart, an old man or residing in a cemetery, waiting for the time to spread death. My name is Dinh, and this is Ms. Hang. I am here today to ask Miss Bich for help in finding the remains of our Aunt Ut. Can you tell me where Ms. Ut died? And when it happened? How come you have started looking for her now? How did she die? Stop it! You two! Go and play somewhere else! Hey! Didn't you hear what I said? Damnit! I told you to stay home and study. You sneak out for football, little brat? Ouch! It hurts! Hurry up! You too! Ms. Bich... Ms. Bich... Is that you Ms. Ut? Please let me know... if it is you. REGION OF LONG AN REGION OF LONG AN Have a drink. Are you here alone or with someone else? Well, I've been alone for a long time, I've gotten used to it. And you, where are you from? I'm looking for someone. Who are you looking for? Do you have a name or address? Tell me and maybe I'll know. Yes... Honestly, I do work related to spirituality. I came down here to find... the remains of a dead young girl. Don't look for her anymore. You won't find her here. What do you mean by that? You don't need to understand. Just stop your searching. I promised her family that I would help them. If you continue looking for her, you will die! I don't understand... Go away, the rain has stopped. Go! But... Get out! It's stopped raining already! Go! Ms. Bich... Ms. Bich... â€ªHAPPINESS - LONGEVITY Ms. Bich... Ms. Bich... Ms. Bich... Ms. Bich... Please continue digging. We dug up all the places you said and didn't see anything. Did you dig them all up? You saw it with your own eyes! What do you want now? Us to continue digging, or what? Ms. Ut? Ms. Ut, is it you? Ms. Ut... Don't worry, Ut. I will definitely find you. Take you home with our parents. If I can't take care of you... I can never die in peace. Ms. Hang... Here is your medicine. You cannot keep skipping your medicine like that. What should we do after this? I am afraid that my time is also running out. Please don't say that. I know myself well. So I beg you, try to find Ut for me. I understand. The thing is... Psychic energy doesn't always work. Miss, could you pass us the ball? Ms. Ut, I hope you will hear me. Please show me the way. I will definitely bring you home! Hey, you there! Why are you still searching? You... Who are you? I am you. Shut up! Dinh! Dinh! Dinh! Are you okay? Are you okay? I'm fine. You just arrived? I just got here. Where is it? My Ut. Finally, I found you. Shall we go home together? Big sister... Sister... Don't leave me alone For a thousand lives later Sister... For a thousand lives later For a thousand lives later Big sister... After my sister died, our parents decided to buy this house. I will continue trying to "speak" to her. Miss Le Thi Hong Bich. If you can hear me... please give me a sign. I'm Dinh... and this is Hang. Within a dead person, there are Three Ethereal Souls: "Serene Essence," "Clear Divinity," and "Embryonic Radiance." If you want to know where the lost body is, you can only trick one of those souls, and let it lead you to the said location. Hang... Ut is here... Ut, my dear! Big sister... I'm leaving now.
