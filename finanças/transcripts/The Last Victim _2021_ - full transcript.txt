(♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) JAKE: I've lived long enough to see what happens when progress marches through town. Rarely stops long enough to let everyone catch up. If you are not paying attention, got caught up in your own problems, well sometimes, it just rolls over you. It don't wait for your concerns. It don't stop to count the bodies. And now at night, you can see the big cities all lit up from space. Glittering like a virus, spreading across this diseased planet. Fueled by greed and corruption, people playing us all like pawns on a chessboard. Well, what happens if those pawns don't do as they're told? What if they move to whatever space they want? Would the kingdom crumble? When you finally learn to see through all of the frivolous distractions and blatant falsehoods, you realize that you're left with only your principles, the choices you make, and how you respond to the choices made by others. (VEHICLE REVS) (DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE) (TRUCK ENGINE RUMBLING) (TRUCK SEAT SQUEAKING) (DOOR SQUEAKS, BELL DINGS) Sit anywhere you like, hon. (CHAIR SQUEAKS) So... how you been, Manny? All right. Well... that is good to hear. You got a little... Thank you. Sorry about the wait there, can I get you anything? You know what, it smells so damn good in here, I'm just gonna have what my friend here is having. (LAUGHS) Sure thing, hon. Would you like something to drink with that? Thank you, no. I'm all set. Be out in a minute. (DOOR OPENS, SQUEAKS) So... life's good? (SCOFFS) Yeah. Jake... I don't know what it is you think I did-- I don't think you did anything. I just don't-- I don't... I don't know why... -(EXCLAIMS) -(SIZZLING) (TRUCK ENGINE RUMBLING) JAKE: What's wrong, Manny? You know after all this time, I thought you could tell me anything. You can't be smoking in here, mister. You gotta take it outside. I'm sorry. I really and-- I truly am. Well, I gotta say that is nice to hear. It really don't make much of a difference. Hey! Are you listening to me, sir? Jake... is this-- -this is about me and Donna? -(DOOR OPENS) Are you kidding, Manny? I don't give a shit about that. Mister... I ain't gonna ask you again. (SIZZLES) Thank you. Donna ain't my wife no more. You're an adult. She's an adult. You all can make your own decision. In fact, that's what makes this country great, freedom of choice. You can do whatever the hell you want with your life. Get rich, be a lawyer. Be a hooker and get rich fucking lawyers. Whatever you want. But now here's the other side of that coin. Jake, please... JAKE: When you go, and use that miraculous God-given freedom to do something stupid, I now have the freedom to right that wrong. I'm just saying about me and Donna-- Don't you bring her back into this, Manny. This ain't about her. This is about you. Shooting off your goddamn mouth all over the fucking town. Jake... I had no idea who those guys were. And I swear to Christ, man. I-- I didn't know you were serious about that. I thought you were just... you know, running-- running your mouth, talking at your ass, grand plans, and all that shit. I swear to fucking Jesus, man, I had no idea that you run that deal until after I fucking left! You see that is a problem for me. Is that there's truth to believe in what do you say, but that don't take the bullets out of Theo's chest now, -does it? -No, Jake. Jake, Jake, Jake!

It's the only way to say it. Mindy Gaboon. Sounds like a kid's party clown. As opposed to an adult's party clown? Let me ask you again. Where the hell is everybody? Well, Chet and Kelly are still in Fort Haven at that conference. Having themselves a boys night out with the mayor more like. Yeah. You got that right. And it's Dale's day off today, I've been trying to get a hold of him all morning, but he ain't picking up. Sounds about right. Remind me to fire that boy. Why don't you just fire him now? 'Cause you can't get a hold of him. Whose truck is that parked out there? I ran the plates earlier, belongs to some fellow named Manny Randowski. I don't know if he was a victim or a shooter. Jesus.

(♪♪♪) (WHIMPERS) So... where should we go today? -No. -What? -No. -What? I'm not doing another two-hour detour to like the world's biggest chair or the world's lamest ghost town. Okay, now listen to me. I think I've got a good one this time. Come on. You know I'm already nervous about showing up on time. The university isn't expecting you for another three weeks. Even if we stopped and did nothing but drugs for a week, we'd still have a week and a half to spare. Plus... it says here that at this Yag-- yajj-- Yeggy Oh-Lala place, they once filmed an episode of The Outer Limits. Really? No, I just made that up. Why would you do that? Why would you get my hopes up, man? Because it should be enough that it's a beautiful, unique, natural wonderland that we'll probably never get a chance to see again. Hey listen, when our hypothetical children hear the story of our voyage across this great-land-tis-of-thee, what are we gonna hypothetically tell them, huh? That we followed our GPS along the fastest route and nothing that interesting happened? Or are we gonna blow their little hypothetical minds with amazing tales of wild west adventure? Were you really lying about the Outer Limits thing? Yeah. Yeah. (♪♪♪) Set 'em back up, shit for brains? Well, I thought of a better game. Oh yeah, what's that? Well, it's more of a magic trick, I guess. (CHUCKLES) What the fuck you doing, you little piece of shit? Don't worry, I know where it is, man. What the fuck! Oh, hold on now, you don't want me to mess this up. I'ma fucking kill you Oh, famous last words, huh. (CHUCKLES) It's a fucking joke. It was a fucking joke, man! (GRUNTS) Don't fuck it. You point a goddamn gun at me again, I'ma fucking kill you, you hear me? Fucking hear me? It's a fucking dud, man. There's a cold pack in the ice box. Put it on your face before it gets swelled up. Fuck. (SNIFFLES) Bull! What in kitten-killing curiosity happened to you all? Things got complicated with Manny. Hey, what do you mean complicated? You got a first aid kit? Where's Snake and Monroe? JAKE: Snake got called into work last night. Monroe's in the back of the truck. (CREAKS) Bullshit. -Bull, what's going on? -Hey! Hey, get the fuck out of my house! (SNOOPY WINCES IN PAIN) Hey, you get back in that truck full of dead bodies and drive on away from my home. Hey, I'm talking to you. Hey. Hey, this is my fucking house, my fucking property, and now Monroe's dead. And why? You didn't have to kill that boy, you wanted to kill that boy. I told you that before you left. What you think this is about revenge? Don't you get it yet? It's about the fucking principle. Like everything we do. Oh, fuck your principles. Sometimes the earth needs to be tilled before it can be sown, right? (BREATHING HEAVILY) But you are absolutely correct. This is your place, your property. I should treat you with the respect you deserve. I apologize. Now, what's done is done. We are where we are. You understand me? All right. What the fuck happened last night? You saw the back of the truck. Who killed Monroe? The old man lying on top of him. Are you ready? (SNOOPY GROANS) Fuck. Oh, fuck. Fuck. Ah! Where's his gun? Aah. BULL: Huh, where's his gun? Give him the gun, man. (GRUNTS) Like I said, we ain't here for vengeance. We just need some help getting rid of the bodies. Oh, is that all? And the Bronco. This is all getting a little much for me. I know. Honestly, Bull, honestly I do. I get where you're coming from. You've gotta trust me on this... otherwise we're all going down. Your brother, too. You understand me? Now, when this is all over, we have no truck, no bodies, no conviction. Clean and simple. That's how our wonderful system works, I guarantee it. Fuck. Goddamn, all right. What do you need? Just some supplies and place the cops won't ever go looking. I ain't got much here. I got a place... used to dry out cactus buttons out there. Clear air, no one around for miles. Where is that? Some Indian name, I can't even pronounce. Took to calling it, "Purgatory". The way the maps are laid out doesn't really fall in any po-po's jurisdictions, so they just kind of ignore it. Hell, we could burn the Bronco out there and nobody can find the chassis for years. It's on the map, back in my room. (GROANS) (♪♪♪) (RETCHES) (VOMITS, COUGHS) (SPITS) (♪♪♪) (SIGHS) You gotta be kidding me. Hold on, it's okay. No, it's not okay. I mean, we wasted three hours driving out here. It's not a big deal, seriously. It's okay. No, don't-- don't do that! RICHARD: Please. (WHIMPERS) Please don't shut down on me, okay. I am sorry for dragging us out here. We don't have to do any other stupid things I come up with ever again. I promise, okay? I'm sorry. I didn't know it was gonna be closed. I... I've been trying really hard to just go with the flow. You know, and it's just the last few days I mean I'm always anxious, but ever since I took that job, I just feel like. I feel like I am not even in control of myself anymore. Like I'm like almost-- I'm just floating. And I don't know which way the current's gonna pull me. Hey... look at me. You are not floating aimlessly, you know. We're just pioneers, pressing on towards new land. Look, maybe sometimes we can't control where the current takes us, but wherever it is, I'm gonna be right there beside you, okay. I'm gonna take over for a while and get us back on the road. Wait. (ENGINE STARTS) (WHIMPERS) (TIRES SQUEAK) What is going on now, babe? We're getting our three hours back.

Quit your hollering, and go grab my back. She won't make it more than 50 yards. She's probably closer. The fall might have killed her already. Don't tell me what might have happened. Just go find the goddamn body. Head out east to the flatlands, see if she was dumb enough to make a run for it, I'll go west. Look back around just in case. Snoopy you stay here in case she comes back. Y'all spot anything, yell out like supper's ready, I'll come running. All right... do you remember... this was a long time ago, like around Easter or something, when those files suddenly vanished? Vaguely. Okay, well, it seemed like a big deal to you at the time. Well, anyway, yeah, you-- you can't tell 'em this, because I pinky promised and all... but that was Dale. How? He was drunk as hell one night, uh, and he was supposed to be on call and you rung him up and told him to go down to the station and check on Lisa or someone. And so he does down there, his cousin drove him in, and he does his work, then he starts feeling like this good Samaritan, and he helps the cleaning lady take out the trash. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. And then the next day, he realizes the files are gone. (CHUCKLES) So, he figured he probably threw them out with the recycling or something. -My God, that boy. -Mhmm. Yeah. I got hundreds of them Dale stories. If you're lucky, I'll tell you another one tomorrow. (♪♪♪) (PANTS) (SOBS) (PANTS) You know... you're kind of an enigma to me, Gaboon. You know that? How so?

Your daddy was in the military? Oh yeah, 18 years in the Air Force. We never lived more than two years any one place till I got here. How long you been here then? Jeez... I can't remember. I want to say... '85. Yeah. This was a real town. Back then, I wanna tell you, had a real rhythm to it. Why'd you stay all this time? Just to watch this place wither away. I guess as a kid I just-- I don't know going from place to place, friend to friend, school to school, I didn't know what it was like to be in one place. Hmm. So, once you plant your roots. Yeah... something like that. What about you? What planet are you from? -That one. -Hmm. The one with the dirty hub caps, like your car. Okay.

Don't let me stop you, you drink up. Let me ask you a question, slightly off-topic. Do you think that money can truly buy happiness? And I don't just mean hookers or cars or anything like that. I mean, true, honest to God, joy in my heart kinda happiness. What do you think? You see, here's the thing about money, It only works if the other party is willing to accept it. For example, right now you could offer me a $1 million for letting you go. And I wouldn't take it, 'cause what will make me happy is well not going to jail. Good and bad, right and wrong, ain't no such thing. We spend our whole lives searching for meaning in a meaningless universe. And we're disappointed when we find it's not there.

You already got one. Yeah, my brother. Who's out at the nature reserve today? Yes, sir. Yeah. All right, well, I guess we'll catch him out there. Thanks for your help. Hey... you uh, you find anything back there? Jar of pills, smelled like peyote, minor shit. And we're not bringing him in? Bigger fish, Gaboon.

Well, funnily enough, its actually known for its camouflage. Is that right? That is right. (♪♪♪) What happened? GABOON: What's wrong, darlin'? You feeling okay? What's... what did you... Sweetie, I'm telling you, you ain't making a lick of sense. What did you do to me? GABOON: Ain't no need to worry. That's just the peyote kicking in. Just a little insurance policy, 'cause from everything I heard about you, you're one tough son of a bitch, right? First time I took peyote, I spent about an hour trying to arrest a goddamn cactus. Boy howdy has Jake got something planned for you. What's going on? Yeah, he's gonna make a statement with you girl. A real work of art, I tell you what. Where are you taking me? We're finally ready to tell the world we're here, and you're gonna be our calling card. (♪♪♪) Come on. I ain't gonna ask you again, darlin'. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Come on. Goddammit, girl. Come on. Come on. Just like that. Come on. Come on. (SUSAN GRUNTS) Hey! (YELLS) Hey, fucker! Jake! (GRUNTING) Fuck! (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (GROANS) (GROWLS, GRUNTS) Gotta say, you put up one hell of a fight. Now, I can't even hate at you. But this has to end with one of us dying. RICHARD: Susan. (♪♪♪) You forgot something. Hey. I am truly sorry. (SUSAN SHOUTS) (SCREAMS, GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) (♪♪♪) JAKE: Now the trick is when you see the world for what it is, you're no longer welcoming. You can try to pretend, but sooner or later, they'll figure it out and they'll turn on you. So if you don't belong in the world no more, you'll end up with only two choices, escape it or change it. And it seems I can't escape it. SUSAN: Because the idea of defining culture can be viewed as a double-edged sword. It can bring people together in a celebration of their similarities. Or it can tear them apart out of the fear of their differences. And that brings us to what we're gonna be discussing today. So, today we're talking about the methods of execution used at various times throughout history. And more specifically, why each particular group chose the method that they did. And what that says about who we were and who we will one day be. ♪ I used to love the summer ♪ ♪ And since I fell in love With you ♪ ♪ Back then the days were long Brighter ♪ ♪ For wanting something I could feel ♪ ♪ But now you're gone... ♪ I think most people tend to see history as a straight line of evolution.

Over here! I've been looking for you... for a while now. But I suppose you probably figured I was. And everyone who ever meant anything to me is dead. My brother, my best friend, the closest thing I ever had to a pa. You killed them all, lady. Do you hear me? You killed them all. I don't blame you for doing it. But I didn't have much to begin with. And I sure as hell ain't got nothing now. And I am sick of it. I'm sick as shit. I'm sick of sleeping in fucking parks. I'm sick of begging for my goddamn food. I can't remember the last time someone looked me in the goddamn eye and I am fucking sick of it! I can't do this anymore. Ooh, I can't do this anymore. Shut up. You know what I have to live with, huh? Do you? Every time, I shut my eyes, I see someone die. I mean every moment of silence, I hear screaming in my head. And all I wanna do is see my husband again. -But I can't do that. -Stop. 'Cause when I close my eyes, I see him die again and again. It's all the same, fucking worse to me, just-- And you think that I owe you something? (CRYING) Do owe me! Fuck! Fuck! (CRYING) (♪♪♪) Pull the trigger. Just need this to end. I need this to fucking end. I don't want you to die. You're just gonna have to live with it. We both are. But this ends here. Yeah. Do you want a drink?
