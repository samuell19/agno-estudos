Things start happening in my head. It has nothing to do with you. - [David] I know that but it hurts me because I can't help. - I'm not sure anyone can. Dr. Berringer thinks than my head is so screwed up with my past that I can't get myself together today. - I don't care about your past. You're 27, you're beautiful and I love you. Other men have loved you and I know you've made love, so what? - That doesn't bother you? - No, I only care how you behave with me. - You want to much of me. - I want a relationship. - Our relationship is pretty good. I remember my relationship with Michael. He was wonderful so understanding. I thought I loved him. (dramatic music) - [Plaid] Aw honey come on I just wanna talk to you. (dramatic music) - Hold it! Turn around. You alright? (dramatic music) - Oh am I glad to see you. I've been looking all over the desert for you. - Do you mind telling me what this is all about? - Oh I'm Stetson Moore I came out here to make some advertising stills. - Well I found your young lady running around in the desert. - Well they were stealing the equipment outta my car, I went after 'em and when I came back I couldn't find Tania. - Tania? - Yeah I got a deadline to meet thanks for taking care of her. - Well can I see Tania again? - Yeah it's costing me $25 an hour you can see her at the studio. - Studio, what studio? Where? - Artistic Mountain Studio in Hollywood goodbye thanks. - [Blond] Look I have a lot to do just leave me alone. - But I just wanna see Tania. - So do a lot of other gentlemen. - No, no, no I mean-- - Look I run a legitimate business, if you wanna see any of my clients it costs you $25 an hour if you'd like to take some nudes it's a little more. - No, no fully clothed will be perfect. We can't talk here. Can't you leave? Well maybe if, maybe if I hired you like that Stetson fellow to pose for me we could go to the desert or the beach. We could talk there. Hey look why don't I just buy your time for the whole weekend? Great model here I'm getting some great angles.

(dramatic music) - I don't want any part of this crazy scheme of yours, I'm getting out of here. - You think you're leaving with your high class professor. You're staying here 'til I let you go. (screaming) (smacking) - You get out of here before I kill you. (screaming) Oh honey it's alright, it's alright. (crying) (dramatic chord) (cries out) (screaming) (gentle music) - [David] How's your string beans? - Good morning. - How long have you been up? - Not long.

Well you certainly are. Margaret I'm picking up those kids Sunday morning and you can just change your plans. God damn it Abbot you haven't let me have those kids this month and this petty black mail is gonna get you nowhere. Listen do you wanna go back to court and let the judge establish a time for me to have the children? I can't help that. You've got to get a job, you have to go to work. Well you were very successful as a model. Well loose 10 pounds and call those people you used to work for. (camera clicking) (upbeat music) - Hey, you wanna lift? Girl, you're never gonna make it on foot across the desert. Come on don't be scared. - Listen I gave you money and sent you to Vegas to get me the broad that Margie told me about. What the hell'd you bring her back for? - This little girl's gonna make an awful lot of money for you, besides she can't go any place and she daren't shoot off her mouth. One of you ladies has to show Tania how to strip for the customers. - Let me show you how. (upbeat music) That's how you do it honey. (upbeat music) (ominous music) (dramatic chord) - So there you are. Don't ever try that again you stupid fool. I ought to turn you over to the cops. Your uncle told me the whole story. You wanna go back to Greece? (dramatic music) She's all yours Mr. Hanson, you've paid for her. Let me know if you're not completely satisfied. (dramatic music) (dramatic chord) (screaming) (laughing) - [David] Come here. (laughing) (gentle music) - [Man] It's damn hot. (chattering) (gentle music) (ethnic music) (laughing) Tania. Tania, water! Water! (speaking foreign language) Ah, good, good. (speaking foreign language) In a few weeks you'll understand much english soon I won't have to speak Greek to you soon you... You drink Tania it's damn hot. (laughs) You don't learn swear words from your uncle Prime huh? It's damn bad. (gentle music) It's not only the sun that makes one warm. (dramatic chord) (door slams) (knocking) Tania. (knocking) Tania? I like you very much Tania. (gentle music) (dramatic music) (screaming) Bitch. (door slams) (dramatic music) (crying) - [Suit] Dave is the idealistic young architect I've been telling you about. - Everything is just beautiful. - [Suit] Mhm it certainly is. - Well Mary grows all our own vegetables. She takes all of our garbage and works it back into the soil - Why? - For compost. It's very difficult to buy food that hasn't been sprayed with chemicals We are poisoning ourselves, we are polluting man out of existence. Recently children were killed in Alabama because of mercury poisoning. Every one of our major cities has to put so much chlorine in the water that it's almost undrinkable. And here in Los Angeles we breath air that is so polluted that it is the equivalent of smoking two packages of cigarettes a day. - And on days when we have smog alerts, it's like smoking four packs. - One person is going to walk into a grocery store one day read the labels on the cans and say simply and loudly I will not buy any food product with preservatives added, I will not buy any food that has been sprayed with chemicals or poisons. - I will not buy or drive any car that in any way pollutes the air that my neighbor breaths. I will not buy any product or any product in any container that is not biodegradable. I will not live in any house that misuses the land. And that'll be it. The children's area is right here and I have a fenced in yard right next to the recreation area for senior citizens. If we can convince the senior citizens on the idea of living in the community. (laughing) - What'll the dome be used for? - Oh community meetings and it can be booked for private parties by anybody living here. - It'll have a game area around the dome, lot's of room for sauna baths, picnic tables, tennis courts. - I think it's just beautiful. Where will our home be in all of this? - Oh it'll be located about two and a half miles east of the dome on a small hill overlooking a lake. I signed the papers before I left the office. They will be delivered to your attorney in the morning. - Thank you. - I added another 2,000 acres to the 3,800 we've already talked about, now that should help you expand your ecologically sound community. - Oh David. - Fantastic. - I saved the best news til last. The bank of Canada has agreed to come in for one million three hundred thousand dollars, to match the one million three I'm investing in your project. ♫ Hi ho hi ho it's off to Canada we go - Do you know we're really going to Canada? I just can't believe it, I really can't believe it. We're gonna have to buy some coats honey. Do you know how cold it gets up there? (music muffles out speech) (whistling) Whoo! You asleep? Well what's with you? Smile my dear, the world is bright and light and sweet. - Oh David, hold me. I keep having this terrible dream that someone is chasing me. - Who? - I don't know. Oh I'm frightened, I know someone was hurt. (dramatic music) - [Biker] Hey let the chick go man. Now beat it. Beat it before you get hurt. (dramatic music) - Hot damn, she's all alone, I can dig it. - [Biker] Match you for her. Unless you wanna share? - Huh share in hell brother, that's mine. (dramatic music) - Take your clothes off or would you rather I took 'em off for you? (dramatic music) I'm not gonna hurt you I just wanna see what you look like that's all. (dramatic music) I wanna be nice to you. I'll be real good to you. Wait a minute honey. (dramatic music) Here come here to me. Nobody fights Jonesy nobody. (dramatic music) I haven't got all night, take your clothes off. Oh no here, like that. (dramatic music) I won't hurt ya. I'm gonna be nice to ya. Jonesy wouldn't hurt you. I'll be real nice to you. You'll get so you never wanna go away from me. (dramatic music) (dramatic chord) (dramatic music) (screaming) - You know I love driving in the rain. - It's nice. - Tired? (ethnic music) There's a hotel just north of St. Louis abesco. I've stayed there before, we'll be there in an hour. (ethnic music) - You are the new priest. You have come just in time father. - Tell me how may I help you? - Mikas the new shepherd he bewitched my daughter with this. - But it only seems to be a statue of Pan, ancient Greek God of shepherds. - Is it? It is just because you've just arrive to this island that you don't know it's power. - Power? What power? - It is said to turn a virgin's head. - This is only superstition. I have but just arrived here, I will see them both first thing in the morning. - No father that will be to late. You must see them today. - Now? - Yes now. (ethnic music) (flute playing) (laughs) - I've watched you dancing here, when you thought you were alone. (gentle music) (speaking foreign language) - You are Tania Vasalou? You are Mikas? - Yes father. Mikael Skiros, I am called Mikas. - Well this statue of Pan, the widow Vasalou fears it's evil influence. - I meant no harm when I gave it to Tania, I wish only to love and be loved. - Yes well there are many kinds of love. - I know of only one kind. - Do you feel as he does? I see. - He is young and handsome. (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) - Oh my son! My son! My son. Oh my son! You, you must be the one I curse you (spits). - Ticket your uncle sent from America. You must go. You cannot stay on the island, you know that. (dramatic music) It will not be bad in America. Your uncle is a good man, I go pick up the donkey he'll take you to the ship. (dramatic music) - Take Pan he's yours, this is for you. Goodbye Tania. - [David] What are you thinking? - Nothing. Just a place I used to live. - [Mikas] Tania let's make love. - What'd ya say? - I didn't say anything. (gentle music) - [Mikas] Tania, come out! Tania let's make love. (dramatic music) - Am I bad? This feeling that comes over me. You know. - How old are you Tania? Makes no difference. You are a woman now. - Father says for me to pray when I feel like this. - And does it help Tania? (pipe playing) (dramatic music) - Tania! (dramatic chord) Curse on your head! Trying to ruin an innocent child a virgin. And get out of here (muttering). (gentle music) - You will telling me about Mikas. - Ah yes Mikas, a bad influence. - But he arouses me. - You need guidance and prayer, never forget your prayers Tania. - I won't father, I pray father. It's just that I pray and I still feel like it. (dramatic music) - Neglecting your work. Staying out late. Bewitched that's what you are. Maybe I should send you away. I could send you away to America. - But I like it here on the island now that the new priest has come. - The priest is a holy man. - But he is still a man. - Where are you going? - It's hot and I'm going to the beach to cool off. - It's nighttime. Tania! Tania! (dramatic music) - Mother sent some food. - Thank your mother. Thank you too Tania, thank you. - Why did you come here father? - God's will and seeing that father Becarauz went to his reward. - But he was old and sick. And that'll happen to you to if you stay here. - You do not like Zanthi? - I hate this island. There's nothing here but goats and old men. - And Mikas? - Mikas, he's just an ignorant shepherd and not at all like you. - You mustn't think of me as a man Tania. Mikas he is young perhaps you'll marry. - It is not marriage he seeks of me. - Then you must not see him. That kind of love is sinful. - Sin father? But I see the animals in the fields when the urge is upon them. - How dare you speak of yourself, one of God's children as as though you were a beast. - But sometimes I feel as they do. - May God forgive you. Now it is best that you leave. - But you still have my statue. - It is forbidden to pray before false idols. Kneel my child. Listen to me the wages of sin is death eternal death. Can you understand that? - [Tania] There are many things I do not understand. But I do understand how I feel inside and praying won't help. (dramatic music) (dramatic chord) - Did I hurt you? (dramatic music) ♫ Lovely Tania with eyes so sad ♫ Take a look at the dreams you had ♫ Only dreams that had soared to high ♫ Silenced by a sky shadowy and grey ♫ On one very lonely day ♫ Maybe Tania if only you had awakened to skies all new ♫ But to often it seems days past come back home to fast ♫ Haunting those who lie every hour til the day ♫ They die - [Father] Your eminence I write again pleading for permission to come to Athens, I am desperately in need of your guidance. Here on this lonely island I find myself drawn closer and closer to the girl Vasalou. - [Tania] And though Mikas played louder and louder I stayed at home. - [Father] I find her very presence so disturbing that I can scarcely remain true to my vows. - Look, I am young. - I too am still young. - Then you know how I feel. Let me tell you even though it was Mikas who was playing it was you I was thinking of. - You mustn't speak thus. (whispering) You best leave. (dramatic music) - Still mourning for your little bird Tania? I heard he went to Athens. I'll bet you're sorry the way you've treated me. I've been seeing Sophia but if you say the word. - Go away. - Go away is it? Well you were anxious enough to have me around before he came but he won't come back and I won't have you. - He'll come back I know he will. - He's a priest and you're a silly hen and you'll never see him ever again. (dramatic music) - Tania. I want you to promise me something. - Anything father anything. - Leave me alone and don't come back here anymore. - You don't mean that. You can't mean it. - More than anything I've ever said. For the love of God leave me alone. God leave me alone! - Mary, Mary baby what a matter? What is it honey? What is it? Mary, Mary. - I must leave Zanthi. I no longer in good conscious feel I can stay here. You'll say goodbye to Tania for me mother? - You're wasting your time. I told you he came only to say goodbye. Chasing after one of God's chosen. Why was I blessed so? Why not a son? No matter what you do or say he's going away. - We shall see. - Tania you're going to bring God's wrath on your head. I shall go and pray for you. (dramatic music) (gentle music) - Is it true father? Are you leaving the island? Because of me? I won't let you go. - I've heard enough. - You want me. You want me as much as I want you but you're not man enough. (smacks) (dramatic chord) (crying) - [Father Voiceover] For the love of God leave me alone! - [Mikas Voiceover] You wouldn't mind if it was one of the toothless old men in the village. (dramatic music) - [Tania Voiceover] But I see the animals in the fields when the urge is upon them. (dramatic music) (gentle music) (dramatic music) - Beast! (screaming) Beast! (screaming) - Oh Jesus my God what's-- (screaming) What's the matter? (cries out) Jesus what is it? (cries out) Well what is it? (crying) (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) (whipping) (dramatic music) (gentle music) (screaming) (dramatic chord) (screaming) (dramatic chord) (screaming) (dramatic chords) (screaming) (dramatic chord) (screaming) (dramatic chord) (eerie music) (screaming) - Oh David I'm innocent. - Yes you are, you are. - I'm really innocent. I thought I'd killed him. It's over. It's really over. Oh what time is it? - It's 4:30. (dramatic music) - In two hours it'll be morning and I will never have to go through this again. The sun will come up and it'll be the beginning of the rest of my life. ♫ Oh how wonderful it is just to be with you ♫ Smiling happily again like I used to do ♫ Flowers blossoming everywhere ♫ Birds are singing up in the air ♫ Please don't take it away ♫ No don't take it away ♫ Can I live again in a world so new ♫ Can I love again spend my life with you ♫ No more visions of yesterday ♫ Haunting memories far away ♫ Set me free again to be free again ♫ This music in my heart stops when we're apart ♫ Say you'll never go away ♫ Can I change my destiny live my life with you ♫ Go through all eternity build a dream for two ♫ Is is possible to be free of the memory haunting me ♫ Can I live again can I live again ♫ Let me live again let me live again ♫ Let me be free ♫ Is it possible to be free of a memory haunting me ♫ Can I live again can I live again ♫ Let me live again let me live again ♫ Let me be free ♫ Let me be free (upbeat music)
