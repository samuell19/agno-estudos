(low tense music) (birds chirping) (soft instrumental music) - [Mira] This is an oldie. - [James] Oldie but a goodie. I love that picture. - Do you keep this up there all the time? - I do. Having that particular picture up there reminds me that no matter where I go, the most important thing in life to me is us. - [Mira] Those were some good times. - [James] And the best is yet to come. - [Mira] You're so corny. - [James] Yeah yeah. - Man, my ears are really starting to pop now. - Yeah, we still have another thousand feet or so to climb. - [Mira] How high are we now? - Over nine thousand feet. - It is really beautiful up here. - It is. The perfect place to start over. ♪ If the winds should change your mind ♪ - So what do you think? - It's amazing. Now I know why you liked to spend so much time here as a kid. - [James] Some of the best memories of my life were made here. - Okay well. I want to see the inside, come show me. (soft tense music) Wow. - [James] Nice, right? - Yeah. It's cozy. - I'm gonna flip on the power and get the rest of our stuff. - Okay. (chuckles) - Oh shit! - Guess we're not breaking in the new bed. - What? - It's full. - Well... Oh my god. - God, deal with it. I think we broke something. - Everything's working fine on my end. - Oh my god, no seriously! Didn't you hear that? It's a picture frame. Be careful not to cut yourself, you know how you get around blood. - Yeah, I get it. (laughing) - Well what is it? - It's a picture of my grandparents. - What's the matter? - Nothing. - Nothing? - We can talk about it later, just not right now. I got to get something to clean this mess up. - Babe? I think I'm gonna try painting a landscape. I know I don't usually do landscapes but we have this perfect view of the mountain peak just right out front. - I thought you preferred more modern stuff. - I do. I just thought something a little more conventional might be a fun change. - Look at you showing public access. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, like maybe get you a nice little tree over here and ooh a pleasant mountain top here in the back. - Is that supposed to be Bob Ross? - [James] Yeah. - Yeah, I'll just paint this happy little mountain and put it over here by my pile of dead bodies. - You see a forest fire start to arise and a squirrel with a jeep full of Quaaludes. (laughing) - What's wrong with you? God. You're ridiculous. So do you want to talk? - We are talking. - You know what I mean. - No, I don't. - The picture in the car, the awesome foot rub. I mean don't get me wrong, it's really great, it's just-- - Too much? - Well, I don't know I just-- - I understand. - I don't, no that's just it. It's just not the James that I'm used to. - That's good, right? - It's good if it's sincere. - Look, I don't want you to feel like you're doing anything wrong, I'm loving the foot rubs but, you don't feel like everything's just a little off? I don't know like, maybe it's just the new environment, or just coming out here or, you know what? I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry. I want to communicate better. I appreciate you telling me how you feel but, I'm just trying real hard you know? - Yeah I can see that. Sorry. I just I think forcing it is maybe the wrong way to go about it. - I'm not trying to force anything but, don't you agree we're worth fighting for? - Okay. - Alright, you're right. I will stop distracting you and you can get back to work on the feet. - Okay. - [Mira] So maybe do a better job this time. - Yeah, how about that? - [Mira] Ow. (chuckles) What is wrong with you? - Yeah well. - [Mira] Lightly harder. (groans) - Hey, babe. - Yeah? - Have you seen the box with my paintbrushes and paint and everything in it? - No I haven't. Is everything out of the car? - I thought so. I guess I'll go look again. - It should be unlocked, I left the keys in the cup holder. - Okay thanks. - [James] Not a problem. - [Whispering Voice] Mira. Prepare. You're alive. Mira. Mira. (ominous whispering) - [James] Did you find them? - Jeez. - Oh, you did. What's the matter with you? You look spooked. - It's nothing. Not used to the wide open spaces I guess. Seriously I'm fine. - Are you sure? (phone vibrating) (thunder rumbling) (thunder crashing) (low tense music) (building tense music) (ominous whispering) (yelping) - Morning, Mira. How'd you sleep? - Great. So did you know there's know hot water in the shower? - Oh yeah, there's a wood burning water heater in the front cellar, I gotta figure it out. I'll tell you what, later today I'll chop some wood and feed the furnace. - That would be wonderful. - Cool. - I'm sorry I left you on the couch last night. You were out and I did not want to wake you. - Honestly it was fine. I haven't slept that well in ages. - [Mira] Good. - Must be the mountain air. Eggs? - [Mira] Yes please. - Here you are. There you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Did you go out barefoot this morning? - What, are you my mother now? - James I was just asking. - So sorry, I have no idea where that came from. - Are you gonna eat? - Suddenly not all that hungry. - Nice ax. - Yeah it was all I could find. I'm sorry for what happened in there earlier. - You know how familiar that sounds, right? - Look those times are behind us. - Look James, we both worked really hard to fix everything. I mean, we're here you know, I just I don't even want to catch a whiff of going back there again. - You won't, I'm sorry. - Okay. - [James] I love you. - I love you too. Alright, get your ass back in gear. If I don't get some hot water soon, I'm gonna turn that hatchet on you. (gentle ominous music) - [Whispering Voice] Mira. Prepare. (soft ominous music) - Hey Mira. Whoa whoa, are you okay? - My painting. - What about it, it looks good. - [Mira] No, it didn't look like that a second ago. - Yeah you've made good progress. - No, you don't get it, it was different, it was like a nightmare! - Nightmare? - Yes. - Alright, calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down, I know what I saw! - Alright, I'm just saying, you've been out here for six hours, maybe you had a waking dream or something. - Six hours? - Look at the sky, babe, the sun is setting. - Six hours? - Six. You looked like you were really into what you were doing so I didn't want to disturb you. Hey, you've reached a stopping point, I have a surprise for you inside. Hey I'm sorry for starting things off on the wrong foot this morning. I know we came up here to start fresh and I hope that-- - It's perfect. - You know I was thinking, tomorrow we can go out to this old fishing pond my grandpa used to take me to. It's gorgeous up there. - Sure. I might not do any fishing but I can bring my camera along. James? Do you think we can talk about them now. - About who? - Your grandparents. - I mean it's fair of you to ask that. Us staying here and all. I don't know, it's just a very sensitive topic. - I know. We don't have to talk about it if you don't want to talk about it. - No no no. I told you I'd tell you about them. So I will. Each summer when I was growing up I would come up here and spend some time with them. It was always a really good time. I remember each morning, grandma would cook breakfast and grandpa would sit on the porch and smoke a pipe. I don't know it's just one of those random vivid memories. That was until grandpa had his incident. - What happened? - [James] My mom got a call from the sheriff saying that grandma called him reporting grandpa missing. Apparently he wandered off into the woods one night and he never came back. I never knew why. - Did they ever find him? - Yeah. Stark raving mad and naked. He was babbling on some nonsense about voices in the trees. After spending a week in the hospital for exposure, they sent him home. - Oh Jimmy. - But he was never quite right after that. The following summer was the last time I ever came up here. It was different from the others. Grandpa was distant. And I'd often catch grandma crying in her bedroom. She told me she thought he had a stroke but, it was never diagnosed as such. Anyway that picture I showed you, the last photo ever taken of them. I took it. It was the last time I ever saw them alive. It was about a month after I left. Mom got another call from the sheriff. This time telling her that grandma was found dead and grandpa was missing again. The police suspected grandpa but I never believed that, I couldn't believe that. I don't know. - Did the police ever find him? - Never. - My god, James, I'm sorry. No wonder you never want to talk about it. - Yeah well, it feels good to get it off my chest I suppose. - I think we need more wine. - A lot more wine. - Okay. Ready? - Just about. Need to go grab my fliers, okay? - Fliers?. - [James] I'll be quick. - Okay.

You weren't there and you thought I... - [James] You gotta quit making it a habit of these spells, Mira. I've been calling your name for the past couple minutes. - I'm sorry. - Come on, just over this bridge. - Oh man. This place is beautiful. Hey!

Dammit. - [Mira] Did you lose it? - I snagged a piece of driftwood. What the hell? (gasps) - What happened? - That damn thing moved. - What thing? - [James] That! - This? - Just leave it alone, Mira. - Oh god you're bleeding. No don't look at it. - Oh. - No no. Shit. That fish did this? - That fish, that fish should got me. - I don't know babe, this looks pretty bad. I think we need to take you into town and have a doctor look at it, you might need stitches. - Oh no no no, I'll be fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. - No, no it is really deep. I think we should just take you down there. - Would you just put the damn bandage on it, Mira? - There. Maybe next time don't be such a dick about it. - Hey wait. Wait wait wait wait. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (laughing) (gasping) (gasps) - [James] What's the matter, babe? - I had a nightmare. - [James] Nightmare? (gasping) - You okay? - I had a bad dream. - Want to talk about it. - No. I think I just need some fresh air. - Mira. Are you sure you're okay? - Not really. - What'd you dream about? Mira. - You weren't you. You were something else and you were trying to kill me. - [James] It was just a dream. - [Mira] A terrifying dream, alright? It just felt real. - You know I would never hurt you, Mira. - You have before. - You just had to bring that up again. You just had to go there. Is that why the dream scared you so much? Because you think I'm going to. So that's it then. A fucking dream is worth forgetting all the progress we made over the past year, is that it? - No. - Well then what is it? - It's just, god it's this place! Ever since we came here, everything feels strange. - [James] This place? - [Mira] Yeah. - This place is the best thing that's happened to me in quite a long time and here you are digging up ancient history instead of looking into the future. - I can see your future. Enjoy the fucking couch. (soft ominous music) (phone vibrating) James? James? James? Keys. Car keys are in the car. Shit. Dammit James this isn't funny, where are you? No, I don't know when he disappeared, I was in bed. No, he's gone now, what do you mean 24 hours? No, I don't need 24 hours to know that something's wrong! James! Dammit where have you been all fucking day? I was scared out of my mind! Hello? I even called the cops, I've been looking for you everywhere! What have you been fucking doing all day? - Feeling. - What? Oh my god James, what have you done to yourself? - Do it. I've done nothing. As a matter of fact I feel fantastic. - You don't look fantastic. We need to get you out of here, you need to see a doctor! - I'm fine! - No, no you're not. Something wrong is going on here and I think we just need to get you away from here. - I'm not going anywhere. - Baby, your hand looks really bad. I think we should just have somebody look at it and then we'll come right back here, I promise. Okay? Just right back. - Just let me take a shower first. - [Mira] Yeah. - Oh wait. Car keys. - Oh. Better get going. We gotta take off soon. - [Distorted Voice] Mira! What's the matter Mira? - Oh my god. - Do I not do anything for you anymore? - [Mira] What? - I will always love you?

I am evolving into something greater than the flesh that contains us. - What? - I am theirs, I am them. - No, James, I now you're still in there, you just have to fight whatever this is. You have to try. - You all know! (roaring) (roaring) - Hey, hey you! Can you hear me? Please, please I don't know what's going on. (distant roaring) - Why, why are you doing this?
