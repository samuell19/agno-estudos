'SMALL TALK' Oh, I don't like butchers' shop windows, yuck! No, I like... umm... I don't know... Yes, you know what I like for instance? Opening a book months after the holidays and finding sand between the pages. Yeah! And I also like: eating the egg yolk on my plate in one big bite... Eating ham straight from the wrapping paper... Breaking off the corners of cookies. I like... pulling up my socks, and peeing in the shower... But I don't like... I don't like pulling out nose hairs!!!! You know what I like? The innocence of kids. I don't like to make love to a woman and think about what's inside her... I like the catalogue of ManuFrance, the illustrated catastrophes in old encyclopedias. The words: Trans-Europe-Express... Trans-Orient-Express... Trans-Siberia-Express... I like the graffiti down my street. But I don't like the collection of my cousin who lives in Gueunion: nail and hair clippings, beard shavings, appendices and bottles of tears. I'd like to be the witness of a scene ... so enormous ... that nobody would dare use it in a movie! I like the Bois de Boulogne park on holidays. I like the dog of Miss Mauricette. Oh yes: I like... trains getting close to each other, when they approach the station. But I don't like to leave one pea all alone on my plate. I don't like beards without moustaches. I don't like the idea that one sleeps one third of one's life but I like the idea that after death, it won't be worse than before we were born. I like: Bibi Fricotin, Razibu Zouzou, and little C?r?bos. I like Richard Willmark's laugh. And, umm... I don't like... umm... the drop of water that goes back up... I like... umm... my dog when he shakes his fur dry.... but not when he wakes me up by pushing his cold snout against my cheek! When I was a kid, I always liked the smell of toasted bread in the morning, of the plastic around my books when school started again, and the little pots of white glue... at school... I liked taking escalators in the wrong direction, rolling out oilcloth, and stepping on immaculate snow... But I didn't like... and still don't like: the carcasses of Christmas trees on the pavement in January. I like: going on holidays!! You know what I bought this morning with my friends? as a ten o'clock snack... three baguettes, two camemberts, and two little C?tes du Rhone wines. That set us back 23 francs each. Yes, we don't always have holidays! I like to turn on the radio and hear the song I just felt like listening to. But I don't like the end of television broadcasts... especially when I'm not sleepy!! But when I go out at night, I like to turn my head, and see the Eiffel Tower lights go out. And last of all, when I watch a movie in the cinema, I like to see the words: THE END
