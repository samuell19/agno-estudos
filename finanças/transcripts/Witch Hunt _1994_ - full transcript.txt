Laserdisc-rip. Duration: 1:38:37 24.483 fps. News on Parade! Magic comes to Tinseltown. Not since this year's sensation, a frozen 4 course meal on a tray, have people and the press been caught up in such a frenzy. Everybody wants more magic in their lives. Licensed practitioners of magic are popping up like rabbits in a hat trick. Don't like the look of your house? This licensed practitioner will transform every room. How's this for instant interior decorating? There's even do-it-yourself magic. Mr. and Mrs. America are getting into the act. Say... looks like this youngster's really moving up. Licensed magic practitioners and their products may be on the up and up, but there are others who's use of magic is down and dirty! Unlicensed, and underground. They represent magic's dark side. That raised the suspicions of dynamic Senator Larson Crockett. He's leading an anti-magic crusade! His target: Tinseltown! Senator Crockett's convinced that magic, licensed or unlicensed, is un-American, infiltrating our lives, and undermining the American family. Why work, why worship, if there's magic to make things easy? For some of Hollywood's biggest stars and studio moguls, it's time to name names! Politicians and prestidigitators at war. Senator Crockett's political muscle verses magic in Hollywood. From Magic California, this is News on Parade. Magic. Magic! The word conjures images of sloth, degeneracy, and corruption. I brought my committee to Los Angeles where this plague began - and I will not rest... - What's he getting so worked up about? Ah, some people have a problem with magic. What's to worry, I mean, it just makes things easier, right? Never touch the stuff myself. Humph...that's some lifeline you got there. I got a good life. Oh yeah, what's ya do? I'm looking for somebody. Someone in particular, or just someone with an interesting outlook on things? Na, somebody in particular. He owes his ex-wife $7,000 bucks! He moved and forgot to drop the lady a card. So what, the little woman hired you to find someone. - What are you, a detective, or something? - Or something. When you find the guy, you gonna break his legs? Thanks for the conversation. - Oh, thank you, and take a card. - Don't mind if I do. Me, I'm old fashioned Man makes a promise, I figure he should keep it. You talking to me? There's a lady who'd like to have a few words with you, Sidney! She got the last penny she's ever gonna get from me. I don't think so. That's $7,000 bucks back alimony to you! Sidney, your wife and (??) wants to see you. It started off small, it wasn't a conspiracy or anything, it was like a, it was just like a fad! Somebody bent a spoon, or levitated their dog. Next thing you knew, it was starting to spread. Pretty soon the whole neighborhood was doing it. And in a little while, it was all over the place, like a Tupperware party That's him, that's the louse! You're walking pretty straight for a man with no backbone. I'm gonna let you two lovebirds have some time alone. Get in! Now! Good luck, Sidney. Why didn't you just shoot me? Still, I never thought it was evil. It was just natural. It's human curiosity. At worst, I thought it was a crutch. Magic can make people lazy, and if you're not careful, it can creep up on ya. Instead of taking out the trash, the trash takes out itself. Instead of washing the dishes, you just encourage them. Nobody sees it happen to them, it just happens So it makes my job a little tougher, but it's nothing to get hysterical about. Last year, it was hula hoops, and Senator Crockett never held congressional hearings about that. Sure, I get tempted to use it, who doesn't? But in my business, it's better just to work clean. I knew a private eye who hired a witch to put a tail on a guy, and the poor bastard had to have it surgically removed. Some things just aren't worth it. Mr. Lovecraft? I'm Kim Hudson. You're in the movies. Which one of my efforts have you seen? I don't remember the title. You were in a bathtub full of bubbles, and you had your, big toe stuck in a faucet. Let's do it. The name of the picture! Let's do it. It was a very sophisticated comedy. You know the part I liked best, when the fat plumber came in. So... What can I do you for, Miss Hudson? Actually, it's Mrs. Gotlieb. I'm married to N.J. Gotlieb. The producer? There's only one. And, I have reason to believe he's being unfaithful to me. What sort of reason? Nicky's producing my new picture, Palisade. He hired a girl for a walk-on, but her part keeps getting bigger and bigger. Now, you'd have to be as dumb as I look, not to figure it out. Forty-five dollars a day, plus gas and expenses. Just give me something solid I can take to my lawyers. I'm sure, whatever he's up to, it'll be cheap, tawdry, and decidedly third rate. Please. We gather together and close this circle to repute the whispers in the darkness. Cord stronger than a thread, rope stronger than a cord. A pledge, a bond, a sacrifice. - Hi, Phil. - Trudy. Come to join the coven? Not today, angel. Anytime you want, Phil. Anytime at all. You be careful what you wish for. Who's that producer your working for at Palisade? - N.J. Gotlieb. - That's the right one. - I'm on my way there right now. - You want a lift? Thank you. What's the story on Gotlieb? He's short. You have to be careful with short men. Their auras are compressed. Is he the sort of man who would cheat on his wife? Only if it occurred to him? What is that stuff? You really don't want to know. Watch your step, sir. We all set? I'm ready. All right! Hit it! Mr. Gotlieb. Have you got any gold fillings in your teeth? - What's it to you? - Nothing, it's just that they tend to melt if you stand too close. Mind your teeth. Fair is foul and foul is fair. Hover through the fog, and the filthy air! What place is this? Aw, it's a real pleasure, Bill. Welcome to Hollywood. Holly...wood? I got a couple of people I'd like you to say hello to. I-I, am N.J. Gotlieb. This is Miss. Tracy Pinkem, really something special. Absolutely love your stuff, when Nicky said you'd be doing my additional dialogue Okay. Okay! This is Malcolm Purdy. - Head of production. - Shakespeare, what an honor. - Armand Vacuole, business affairs. - How do you do. - Ah, ah, Jim and Ted. - Ted and Jim, actually. Yeah, whatever! Great writers. They'll help you over the bumps. Ah! Trevor Bunt, best director in town! And, Mr. Frank Krusnik, of the William Morris agency. Who are you? Oh! I'm-I'm with the witch. Ah, excuse me a second, will you, Bill. Somebody get Bill here a parking space. Paint over whats-his-name, that Nobel prize guy. Finn Macha. Moses on a pony, if it isn't Phil Lovecraft. Well, how's the world treating you, Dickface? I thought you were in Chicago. I miss the friendly people, and the orange groves. What are you doing for Gotlieb? Privileged information. But from one lodge member to another, he called me in as a security consultant and expeditor. I tie up loose ends. It seems to me they're still looking for a couple of people you expedited. Are you still chasing naughty husbands, Dickface? And drying the tears of those poor lonely wifey-poos? Tell me something. Honestly. Do I look like I have a dick on my face? That's why I like you, Phil. I like to take things apart. See how they work. Watches, phonographs, people. I like to see inside. Well, I'll see you around, Phil. I don't think so. Oh, there's no doubt about it. You and me, we've still got business to settle. Who was that? It's somebody I know. He has a sour eye. The devil can put all manner of mischief in an eye like that. If it were mine, I'd pluck it out. Let's get outta here. I followed Gotlieb up to Los Feliz I wish I had a rum punch for every time somebody in my business followed a car up to Los Feliz. Look at the motion picture industry, friends. Why do you think everyone is beautiful? Magic! Why don't they ever get old? Magic! Why are their jokes always funny? Magic! It was creepy up there. I cut my lights and stayed back. The last thing I needed was to get turned to stone, or end up with the body of a goat. Standing! In my dressing room. With my wardrobe lady. Being fitted into my costume! I'm a movie star, she's a waitress. How do you think that makes me feel? I gotta do what I think is best for the picture. My picture. MY picture. You're replacing me with that skinny-ass car-hop! We're married, you crumb. What will people think? Don't make a big deal out of it, Kim! There are lots of other studios, you'll land on your feet. You can't do this to me. What about our marriage? That wasn't a marriage, that was a license to shop. What about my 3 year contract?! Have your people talk to my people. The public won't stand for this! The public? What you fail to grasp is just how replaceable you are! You're nothing but nice tits, and a pleasant smile! You'll be forgotten before you reach the gate! This isn't the first time I've been fucked in a producer's office. Just you. Not Dickens. N.J. Gotlieb. It's Harry Schrodinger. Five minutes! So, he won an Oscar. He hasn't had a hit for five years! But I'm willing to give the rummy another chance, because I'm sentimental. Tell him he's got 'til 5 o'clock! Take it, or leave it! What do you want? I want to make my report. - Save it. You're fired. - I am? You're fired. I'm fired. Everybody's fired. You want to know where he went last night? I couldn't care less. He went to a big house in the hills above Los Feliz. You said he went where? In a house on Glendower Avenue. - That cow. - Now, what cow would that be? - Get that, will ya? - No, you fired me, remember? Yeah, it's me. Am I in your way? Get them out of here. All right. Come on. Hi. What the hell are you doing here? It's go to see you too, Bradbury. What happened? Come on, give. I'm a friend of the widows. What happened? Somebody put the big whammy on Gotlieb and cut him down to size. Wow! And... Ever see two dogs play tug-of-war with a bone? Forget the gurney, you can get him out of here in a lunch pail. Are you thinking of something? I'm thinking that, according to this lady, the last person to see Gotlieb before he got small was your friend the widow. Okay. Okay. Break it up. This is a police investigation. Come on. Lt. Bradbury. Heard good things about you. Larson Crockett. What's being done about this ghastly business? We're working on it. Good! This is just another example of how magic has shot its sinister tentacles into the motion picture industry. I give my personal pledge that soon a new day will dawn on a witch free America. A more wholesome country, as we proceed with our Los Angeles hearings and prepare our patriotism rally... I thought the magic was trouble, but now... Now that they're trying to outlaw the stuff... How come I'm not so happy? If God doesn't destroy Hollywood He owes Sodom and Gomorrah an apology. As my dear friend Norman Desmond is so fond of saying, maybe the pictures got small. But Nicky Gotlieb never got small. Well, he did, actually. But not until the very end. When he got really small. Onerous? You may be the head of a studio. You may be a big star. In heaven, we are all just bit players. Under contract to the one who discovered us. Cecil B. DeMille. Fatty Arbuckle. Nicky Gotlieb. All just walk-ons. In the part we were born to play. God's little extra. In Nicky's case, God's very-little extra. God's littlest extra. But no less dear to God, as he was dear to us. So, farewell, N.J. Gotlieb. We have reached the final fade-out. But, dear friends. Think of it not so much as a fade-out, but as a dissolve for a fair world. We have to talk. Awful nice, you showing up for his funeral. I am the widow. Besides, it'd look funny if I didn't come. People might get the wrong idea. And what idea would that be? I wanna hire you. You hire me. You fire me. Now you wanna hire me again. I think the police think I killed Nicky. - I think you're right. - I didn't. Uh-huh. You believe me, don't you? Doesn't matter what I believe, matters what I can prove. Well, prove it. Oh! Well, you're tough, aren't you? That's me. Are you tough enough to put your husband in that parakeet coffin? Don't strain yourself trying to figure me out, Lovecraft. Just find out who killed Nicky, and get me off the hook. Can you get the keys to his car? His car? The Lincoln he was driving the other night. Well, I can get them for you. I'll start with that, and the house on Glendower. Forget about the house on Glendower. There's nothing there you have to know about. - Well, I'll decide that for myself. - Stay clear of that place. You know the cops are only going to work as hard as they have to. If the frame fits, you're gonna wear it. The keys to the Lincoln will be at the house. Somebody slipped me a Mickey the other night. What kind of a Mickey? A raven landed on the hood of my car. And the next thing I know, it's morning. Ooh, nice touch! I man, you don't see that kind of workmanship around these days. It's usually just frogs. Not even toads, just frogs. Oh, but yours... Anyway, what was the purpose of this Mickey? I was following somebody. And when you woke up, he was gone. And now he's dead. - N.J. Gotlieb. - The same. I'm going out to look at his car, and... I was... hoping that maybe you might go with me. Are you asking me for help? Well, I'm asking you to watch my back for ravens. Okay? I have to make a phone call. So! What are we looking for? I don't know. There's sand on the drivers side. And none on the passengers. He went to the beach alone? Or he went with someone who didn't come back with him. Is this what you do when you detect? Yeah, basically. Well, it doesn't seem very precise to me. What's buzzin', cousins? What is this, a field trip? I had to have somebody watching my back while I was watching yours. Besides, Trudy might be able to help. God knows I'm willing. What kinda help? Events cling to objects, and Trudy is very good at 'hearing' their memories. Very, very good. You want to know what happened to Gotlieb, where he and his friend went? I don't use magic. Purist! Who said boo about magic? You drive the car. I read the map. That's all. And what are you, the chaperone? What about my car? We have to take this car. This holds the memories. It'll be our little secret. I get the front seat! Thanks. Here's where I lost them. It was raining when they got back in the car. Gotlieb, and... another man. What am I, the chauffeur? Never mind. Keep Driving. You're gonna have the time of your life. They drove down the hill. Where do I go? West on Sunset, all the way to the beach. This is where they came. Now, you can wait here. You forget, we can help. I found the house, didn't I? You want me to tell you who owns it? Yes. I can almost feel it. It's definitely coming. Well, when it hits you would you let me know. Want me to do that for you? Do you mind? All right. I don't understand. What? There's nothing. Nothing unusual? Nothing at all. This place has been wiped clean, erased, its... I've never... It's so empty. What happened here? - There was a girl. - How do you know that? Doesn't take magic, there's always a girl. Trudy, let's take a look at the bedroom. Can I ask you something? No. What exactly is your problem with magic? I don't have a problem. - I just don't use it. - Why? I've got personal reasons. It's a pity. Kropotkin says you have the qualities of a Magus. To know. To dare. To will. What? Somebody wiped the prints off the bottle like they wiped the house of memories. So you wouldn't know anyone was here. The easy thing would have been to take the bottle and ditch it. Unless... Unless? Unless... Unless you wanted to make a show of wiping the prints because... you want someone know what you were doing Why would they do that? You're the one that writes screenplays. You tell me. Beverly Wilshire Hotel, good morning. Room 1209. I'm sorry, those calls are being held. Would you like to leave a message for Senator Crockett? Oh, no, that's okay, thanks. What was that? Nobody's slept here. Look at that bed. There's not a ruffle on it. It's perfectly smooth. More show. Trudy, it's all right. No, it's not, it's not all right! There's nothing here. Nothing! Somebody sucked the life out of this place. It's so empty it makes my head hurt. It's all right, kid. You did your best. You don't understand. This place is dead, as dead as the moon. That's not right at all. Two rules you learn in this business. Get paid up front and don't work with partners. The bathroom wasn't empty after all. Someone had left a stem of a martini glass from the bar. More show? It took us three hours to get home from Malibu. Then Trudy made us stop to listen to a building. Jesus! You see that? You see what he done? Frisk him. Move. Where? You're interested in that house, aren't you? In. And sit. Thanks. - He polite. - Shut up. Watch him. By which, I mean... - Watch him! - I'll watch him. Still using zombies. I thought that went out. I just work here. Don't they start to smell? Not for three months, depending on the weather. You coulda put out my eye with that cigarette gag. Yeah. You think burning somebody's face is a joke, huh, sailor? No, that's not a joke. Two cannibals are eating a clown. One says does that taste funny to you? Now that-that-that's a joke. Stand up, sailor. Let's see how funny it is with your face. What's your name. kid? Tyrone. Tyrone. You're not the sharpest pencil in the box, are you? Once in a lifetime... If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage. What do I care about television. If he's so hot for the rights, let him have 'em. Hey! Hey, sister!

Good evening, sir. Perhaps a bit more sophistication. Of course. And a little more up top. Now you two run along. Hello. My name is Vivian Dart. Welcome to my home. Are you looking for anything particular tonight? Oh, I'm way past being particular. Then I've got exactly what you want. Right this way. I don't believe I caught the name. Better nails today. You're a manicurist? Small world, isn't it? You're getting too old for this, Phil. Where's my wallet? You're leaving so soon? You and me have got such a lot of catching up to do. He shouldn't be up here at all. Vivian, will you treat the man with a little more respect? Phil and me are members of the same noble profession. What are you doing here, Macha? Now, I've told ya, I'm a private security consultant. I help Miss Dart make sure the place runs nice and smooth. You're a bouncer in a whore house? Cut the reunion, and get him out of here. I think you upset her with that whorehouse crack. Were you working for Dart, or Gotlieb, when he brought the Senator up here? I'm not sure I know what you're talking about, Phil. How come I don't trust you, Macha? You don't trust yourself, how do you trust anybody else? If you ever get tired of crawling around in the bushes, Phillip, let me know. Always room for a man like you in my organization. Here's your wallet. Who's got my gun? I'll keep it. You'll come around, just you see. Well, you seem pretty sure. Ever wondered why it's the guy, not the girl, that's nervous on prom night? That's because the girl knows how it's going to come out. And that's the way it is between you and me, Phillip. I'm the girl, I know how it's going to come out. Call ahead next time, Vivian will let you in the front door. What happened out at the beach house, Macha? Which beach house would that be, Phillip? You know the one. The one without any fingerprints. Kim left the house, in her pink car, with a pink dress, and a purse to match. The lady knew how to accessorize. I guess it was something they taught you at the studio. I followed her out the new freeway, past Rosemead, to El Monte. It was a long drive to see a movie. Well, you have an interesting way of mourning, Mrs. Gotlieb. I like to watch my pictures. You could run them in the screening room. I like to watch them big. No problem if I just sit here and watch the show with you? Well, what can I do about it, call an usher? Which picture you in? This one. You know, that big house on Glendower your husband went to the night before he died? It's a high priced cat house. I told you to forget about that house. He went there with a certain gentleman, they picked up a girl, drove to a house down at the beach, made sure I couldn't follow, after he left, something, somebody, made a big show of covering up. Now, what do you suppose that might be? I told you once, I don't know anything. You don't know it all. You know something. You're part of this. I'm coming up in this part, right here. I've kept that stupid pilot on the payroll for years, just for a spot like this. Why doesn't he come? Don't try that again. I want to be seen. I want to be seen. You're very good in this. Jesus, Kim, I was going crazy. I couldn’t find your car, and... Popcorn? It's okay, get in the car. This is nice and cozy, huh? Who is this guy? I work for her. Who are you? She's a friend, and that's all you have to know. Well, what's your name, friend? Marie. Marie! What a nice name. So, ah... tell me something, Marie, get out to the beach much? Shit! Easy. You can't get away, drop the gun. Come and get it. - Stay down. - He's shooting at us. Get out the car. Slowly, slowly, stay down. Get ready. Okay, let's go. That's six. He's out of bullets. That was close. She's taking your car! Marie! Hey! Have a seat. Who you calling? I'm reporting a stolen car. The police? You're calling the police? You can't do that. Why not? The car's not stolen. Not really. She just borrowed the car. And just who is she? A friend. Well, acquaintance, more than a friend. And what does your acquaintance, do for a living? I don't know. I mean, what difference does it make where she works. You wanna know what I figure? I figure she works for Vivian Dart. She's one of those girls from that big house on Glendower. I figure she's the girl that your husband dropped at the beach house with Crockett. Now, if that's so, why is she so worried? And how come she came running to you, of all people? You know somebody by the name of Finn Mocha? Who's Finn Mocha? He was doing some consulting work for your husband at the same time he was working for Vivian Dart. I don't know him. Well, you don't know much of anything, do you, Mrs. Gotlieb? Oh! I'm not the worst person you ever met. Oh, I didn't say that. Fact is... I kind of like you. Most of the men I meet, well... You can pretty much see right through them. You're different. Solid. In a mature sort of way. Yeah. There's too many unanswered questions for you and me to start having that particular conversation. Who says? I say. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm interested! Stay, here! Where you going? Oh, I don't answer your questions, until you start answering mine. A few hours earlier she'd been watching a movie, now she was a stiff. No matter how many times I saw it, it always got to me. You know the story, girl falls in with wrong crowd. One minute she's a fresh faced gal, and the next, she's stuck in the window of Saks. Bradbury. A couple of kids saw her drive off the pier, and managed to get the license number before it sank, I thought you might be interested. Take a look inside. Foot's still on the accelerator. Look at her face! Suicides don't look like that. She didn't know she was driving off a pier. Somebody put the whammy on her. She probably thought she was at the Rose Parade! Who is she, Phil? It's your client's car, but that ain't your client. Who is she? She lent the car to a friend. I don't know her name. Come here. You wouldn't happen to know where your client was this evening, would you? - I got a pretty good idea. - Good. She hasn't been home since she took this wagon out. Suppose I wanted to talk to her. You wouldn't get all coy all of a sudden, would you? It's a free country, Bradbury. I mean, you can talk to anybody that you want to. This Kim Hudson's a pretty good-looking woman, if you go in for that movie star sort of a thing. Uh-huh. And she's gotten herself involved in two homicides in three days. Are you getting near the point? Just this... Don't get complicated, Phil. A man gets too complicated, he starts to make mistakes. I'll keep that in mind. Good! She's gone. Your actress friend. The lady has secrets. Everybody has secrets. Drink your coffee. Everywhere I go in this case is water. Rain. The ocean. Swimming pools. Water is very potent. Water makes me nervous. What kind of donuts are these? Two jellies and a bear claw. - I'll take the bear claw. - I want the bear claw. Then why did you get the jelly donuts? Half the bear claw, all right? The raven is still with you, at your shoulder. I can't see it, but I know it's there. The question is, who's raven is it? Oh, it's yours. The raven belongs to you, as does the snake it carries in it's beak. I didn't tell you about the snake. No. You did not. We're looking for Hypolyta Kropotkin. You've found Hypolyta Kropotkin. Hypolyta Kropotkin, I'm here to serve you with this summons to appear at the special senate subcommittee on unnatural activities, as chaired by Senator Larson Crockett. Duly served. What's the big idea? Are you Lovecraft? Yeah, I'm Lovecraft! The senator would like to meet you. I made my way up to the Pilgrimage Theater, where Crockett was preparing his rallying. It's where the hold the Boy Scout Jamboree every year. Crockett must have felt right at home. He didn't drink, he didn't smoke, he didn't lust. I couldn't figure out what he wanted from me. Larson Crockett. Pleased to meet you. Phil Lovecraft. Heard a lot about you, Phil. Heard a considerable lot about you. Hope you don't mind meeting out here, got a lot to do and precious little time. Our support grows bigger every day. That's a little premature, isn't it? The stake? You might say it's symbolic. Nice centerpiece for the rally. Of course, now that congress has passed the capital punishment bill, well, then, it could be something else, couldn't it? Why did you subpoena Kropotkin? I take it you know she's a card-carrying witch! Having an office across from her, you probably see things, hear things, smell things. I'm smelling something right now. I thought you were the man who didn't believe in magic? Oh, I believe in it, I just don't use it. Oh, it's a gift from a friend. Friends are a valuable commodity, Phil, but you gotta be careful. Don't let people get too close. Things rub off. A man has to very careful of the company he keeps. You must get very lonely. Would you give a loaded gun to a child, Lovecraft? Would you let a baby play with a blowtorch? Of course you wouldn't! I love the people of this country. I love them enough to protect them from sinister forces, out to exploit their appetites. I want you to join my personal staff. Come on-board as a full-time paid investigator. Together, we could bring about an end to this plague! Well, I appreciate your offer, but I got clients. The Gotlieb killing? There are better uses for your talents. How many times did you and Gotlieb meet? Just once. He came by my hotel. He wanted to talk in private, so we drove around for a few hours. He told me many disturbing things about the influence of magic in the motion picture business. I tried to get him to testify for my committee, but he was too afraid, not unjustifiably as it turned out. Well, that's too bad. Yes, Gotlieb would have made a very powerful witness, but under the circumstances, his wife will be just as effective. As Gotlieb's widow, she felt it was her duty to uncover the forces of magic corrupting the movies. She's testifying tomorrow morning, just before your friend Kropotkin. Hudson's your client, isn't she? State your name for the record. My name is Mrs. N.J. Gotlieb. Be seated. You are the widow of motion picture producer N.J. Gotlieb, is that correct? Yes, sir. Did your husband ever express to you his concern about the pernicious influence of magic in the motion picture business? Oh, yes, my husband, my late husband, often confided in me his growing sense of apprehension. He felt the practitioners of magic had an agenda that was outside the needs and desires of ordinary America. You are testifying in your husband's place this morning? That is correct, senator. Why is that? Nicky, my husband, can no longer speak for himself. He was... killed. Murdered by magic! The woman is good! Ah, she's gotta be good, she doesn't have a contract anymore. Mrs. Gotlieb. Do you recognize the item in this envelope? Excuse me? The item in this envelope, do you recognize it? That's Nicky's watch chain, how did you get this? To your knowledge, was this chain in your husband’s possession at the time of his death? I guess so. That's an interesting piece of metal at the fob, did you give him that charm? No. But you know who did give it to him, don't you, Mrs. Gotlieb? I think it was someone at the studio. What was that person's name? We're waiting, Mrs. Gotlieb? What was the name of that person? Senator... I... think this is sort of outside what... I expected we would be talking about. The name, Mrs. Gotlieb, give us the name. I believe her name... is... Kropotkin. Hypolyta Kropotkin. This Kropotkin woman, is she a practitioner? I believe so... yes. - But senator, I'm sure... - The witness may step down. - Thank you very much for your time. - But senator. Call the next witness. Hypolyta Kropotkin, come forward and be heard. State your name for the record. Hypolyta Lavoe Kropotkin. Hypolyta Lavoe Kropotkin, are you now, or have you ever been, a witch? Ice, cloud, river... water is always water. Is that a yes, or a no? That is a yes. Is that you in the photographs? Yes, it is. Who are the other people with you? -Those are my friends. - Better get outta here. Just go, go, go. Are they not, in fact, members of your coven? There is nothing shameful in a coven. What are the circumstances of your participation in this coven? When, where, who else was there? What are their names? The names of people whose souls are laced with magic, that is what you want? That is what we want. Then give me the phone book and I'll start with the A's. Magic is in every one of us, it's as common as salt. What you want to do is to prevent people from finding it and nurture it. Don't think you're the first practitioner who's tried to excuse their behavior with this cloudy reference to natural magic. Now, I'll give you one more chance to identify the other members of your coven. I decline to do so, respectfully. Mrs. Kropotkin, do you recognize the item in this envelope? It is familiar to me. Did you give this item to N.J. Gotlieb? Yes. Let the record show that the unfortunate Mr. Gotlieb, had this item, in his possession when he was diminished by supernatural means. Did you do anything to this stone before you gave it to him? There is an incantation for peace and wisdom and resolve in purpose. You cast a spell on the stone. Is that what you're saying? A benevolent one. A benevolent one! I have here the laboratory report from the FBI on this particular stone. It concludes that there are measurable levels of the most pernicious and toxic magic they have ever encountered. More than enough to do what was done to the unwitting Mr. Gotlieb. What are you suggesting, senator? I am suggesting, my good woman, that you are a witch, and a practitioner. That you gave this tainted item to an innocent man, about to reveal your sinister cabal, and that man is now dead! Hypolyta Kropotkin, we have evidence of how you used your shameless and unwholesome powers. I give you this opportunity to recant your belief in magic, renounce all supernatural agents and activities, and purge yourself of all affiliations with other witches, conjurers, - and similar practitioners. - I recant nothing. I renounce no one. And I need no purging! You leave me no alternative. Hypolyta Lavoe Kropotkin, the Congress of the United States of America hereby brands you a murderer, and consort of the devil. In keeping with the emergency powers of the Unnatural Activity Act, I order you to be taken to a public place, where you will be burned as punishment for your crimes and for the enlightenment of the general population. - Sgt. at arms, take her into custody. - It's not right. Motion to adjourn. - Kropotkin! - Lovecraft. Crockett! Hard ball, Mr. Lovecraft. Kim? You want to tell me why you got in the pool? Crockett set me up. He said I'd be cleared and everything would just go away if I made a little speech about the evils of magic. I didn't know he was going to ask me about the watch fob, or Kropotkin. I honestly didn't know. Now they're gonna burn her. I thought it was the way to fix it. Oh, it's fixed all right. Did they tell you that your friend Marie is dead? What? They fished her out of the bay in your car. No, I didn't know. Who was she? She worked for Vivian Dart. Marie's the girl Nicky brought to the beach house for Crockett. What's your connection with Dart? She did some work for me once. What kind of work? I worked in the steno pool of that studio for six years, saving every penny. I went from typing scripts, to being a star, overnight. Vivian... Dart, did the ah... enchanting? She gave me, whatever it is, that movie stars have. That thing we all want. I got it! Nobody at the studio recognized you? No one at the studio even looked at me before the spell. Gotleib didn't know? Nobody knew. Except Dart, and that Irishman that works for her. Macha. I had to pay him off regular. I bet. You met Marie... at Darts? She worked with Macha and Dart on special dates. And she does what? Well, when they wanted to set someone up, they let the sex get a little rough. Then Marie hits her head or slips in the bathtub, and drowns. Macha shows up, says everything can be taken care of for a price. The patsy pays, leaves. Marie's free to play another day. So that's what happened at the beach house. They're shaking down the senator, Something goes wrong. Presto change-o. What's wrong with having what you want? I just wanted to be happy. They got pills for that now. Phew! Water! Water everywhere. You don't know everything. You don't have the magic in your blood. You don't have it on your skin every day of your life. No, but I used to once, a long time ago, just once. There were two men, they're going out on a boat and I needed to hear what they said. So I hid an empty bottle on board, and when they came back, I took the bottle, and I poured the conversation out, and I had what I needed. But they weren't alone on the boat, there was a girl. So when the cops came after 'em, they figured the girl had ratted. Cops got 'em both, but before they did, one of 'em had time to take her back out on that boat strangle her, and throw her body in the bay. Am now, the man and the bottle has come back. Busy, busy, busy. Rush, rush, rush! How'd you get up here? You forget, somebody showed me the back way. Where's Mocha? Was it your idea or Mocha's, to set up Crockett in the badger game? I know it wasn't Gotlieb, all he wanted to do was show him a good time. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not interested in you. Finn Mocha! Oh, he's something else again, isn't he? I'm done with Macha, that partnership is dissolved. I'm taking a long, long, vacation. Where is he? He's leaving. I'm a lucky man. I don't suppose you need any help with your luggage, do you, Vivian? Guess not. Watch the noise, fellas. You know what they say about zombies? What? Strong as hell, but very bad lateral movement. Mint? Let's try it one more time. Where's Mocha? Get your flags! Evening, Lovecraft, glad you could make it. How much is in there? Oh, not so much in the grand scheme of things. Expediting pays pretty good. So does discretion. You had Gotlieb killed. You thought he was the one working the badger game. I'm afraid I went off a little half-cocked. And the girl. Loose ends, Phil. You know how I am about loose ends. And, whose idea was it to set up Kropotkin? Mine. The senator wanted to use Kim, but I convinced him that the frame would be a better fit using the witch. So, this guy's gonna blackmail you and now you're acting like long lost brothers. Politics makes strange bedfellows, I guess. But he's a practitioner! So? It was all a show. The hearings, the press coverage. Attacking magic. You could care less about protecting the people. Spend some time in congress, Phil. You get up-to-here with the people. Listening to their petty complaints, their demands, their constant inane whining about one thing after the next thing, after the next thing, after the next thing! Just because they vote for you, they think you owe them something! But why go after magic? Who am I supposed to go after? Big business? You need something a little different, a little outside. Let me tell you something about the people, Phil. You lock any ten of 'em in a room, they may not elect a leader, but I guarantee they'll pick someone to hate. Burn the witch, burn the witch... Back up! Back up! Stay back! Come on! Back off! Stay back! I'm not gonna let you burn her. The witch will burn, and there's nothing you can do about it. You'd be surprised what I can do. Really? Gentleman. Did you hear everything? Yes, sir. What was the gist of our conversation? They brought money in that satchel, they thought they could pay you off. Well then, you'd better arrest them. What are you trying to pull, Crockett? I'd better take that for evidence. No one double crosses Finn Macha! I'm the one that sees inside. If you don't believe me, ask Lovecraft. I see what's inside, and I bring it out! What you are is an insignificant little Mick. The crack of Solomon on your heart. Bring them both. I don't want them to miss the show. What did you just do? Someone just remarked... This could make a great movie. Wil, work on something, will ya? Well, I think we have something just as special. Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Larson Crockett! America, is going to be... all right! And it's going to be all right because of people like you! God... God, I love this country. The fire we light tonight will burn across America. It will set fires in every city and every town. Can I count on you? Can I depend on you? Of course I can! We know the difference - Between right and wrong. - No one double-crosses Finn Macha. And we know our cause... The cameras, the cameras! The cameras? Off, now! That feels good! Nothing like a little fresh air! Looks like we're having a little party! Well, guess who just showed up? Hey! What the fuck you lookin' at? Come on! Time to burn the witch. Come on, we're gonna burn her, then we're gonna burn another one, and another one, and another one after that. We're gonna stack 'em up like firewood! Come on, what's wrong with you people? You're pretty loud when you want something! Oh, Senator Crockett, I-I deserve better. Oh, Senator Crockett, I deserve a better life! Oh, Senator Crockett, I deserve TV dinners, and T-birds, and lawns to cut! And peace of mind. Well, I got news for all of you, you're not gonna get it! I'll tell you what you're gonna get, porno video, and double-digit inflation, and a designated hitter. And wars in countries you never even heard of! Now that's what I call a world without magic! Hey! Where you all going?! The party just started. I thought you wanted me to help you out! I thought you liked me! Ah, fuck it! I'll do it myself. Go on, arrest him! Arrest both of them. Your names? I want both your names! Let go, you! I have friends in high places! Come on. Where's Macha? I don't know. He took off when Crockett came out of his shell. I gotta find him. We've got some unfinished business. It seems he feels the same way too. You stay here. You shouldn't do this alone. Yes, I should. Some people use magic for gain or revenge, But Macha... Macha uses it out of malice. It's not just his eye that's sour, it's his soul. Then I guess you better keep the motor running. Lovely of you to come, Phillip, and at such short notice. So how'd things work out with Senator Crockett? They're trying to put him together. No one double-crosses Finn Macha. Too bad you left before the end. But that wasn't the end, Phillip. This is it, right here. Where is she? Where's Kim? I haven't forgotten that business with the bottle. I figure, once a man uses magic, he may use it again. And I want that man on my team. I don't use magic. We'll see. I ask you a question. Well, where do you think she might be? I'm a fan of old movies. I like to watch them over, and over. And there's one I'd like to show you. Except, it's not that old. Just a couple of days. Come along, Phillip. Here's my screening room. And this is my movie. - Call me Mr. President again. - Mr. President. Take a seat. A wonderful thing about old movies is you get to recast them. Take this one for instance, it wasn't cast right. That's much better. I've also done a little rewrite. In the original, the girl didn't die, but considering the new cast, she will. Well, aren't you going to do anything? Think of the little lady. Let her go. Well, you could make me. You could whip up some of the Mojo Hoodoo. Conjure up a lightning bolt and strike me down. You want some incentive? No! You have the power! You know the words! You know the spells! You let one girl die because you used magic. Are you going to let another one die because you won't! Work for me, Phil. Darling, you're about to die of principles. I don't use magic. Well, the pity is, I do. Help me. Water, water, everywhere. I'm sorry, Phil, I couldn't let you do it. I flipped the bird. - Here you go. - Thank you. You sure this is what you want to do? Pretty sure. Well, the public's gonna wonder what happened to Kim Hudson. Well, if they want to wonder, let 'em. Well, thanks. Good luck. Bye. Wait a second. There's something we forgot. What? Wow! A girl could last the winter on a kiss like that. Don't forget to write. Oh, I won't. Kim Hudson disappeared. But since she never really existed, I figured the score was even. It didn't matter anyway, pretty soon another girl would be stepping off the Highland bus, wishing herself into a D-cup, and her big break. Crockett, too. He's the kind of guy who says he hates magic and then goes home and levitates chicks in the basement. Last I heard, he was sharing a cell with himself in San Quentin. And so it goes. There was usually a one-to-one ratio between dreams and disappointments, and no amount of magic could change that. It's always gonna be there if someone wants to believe in it. Let's face it, everybody's gotta believe in something.
