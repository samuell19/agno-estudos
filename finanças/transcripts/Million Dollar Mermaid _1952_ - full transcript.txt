This is lovely Sydney harbor in the year 1900, when Australia was still thought of by the rest of the world as the home of the bush and the boomerang. But in the growing town of Sydney, culture had moved in. And the sounds of those three famous Bs, bach, brahms, and Beethoven, were already being heard in the land. Mozart is very quiet in here, Annette. Oh, hello, daddy. Baby, you mustn't be envious of the others. I know how much you'd like to be out there with 'em, playing and dancing but music can be the source of happiness, too. It's given me great happiness. - Yes, daddy. - That's my girl. No. C-sharp, Mr. Kramer. C-sharp. Mr. Kellerman, Annette is gone. She has disappeared again. But I just left her upstairs. Excuse me, Mr. Kramer, will you? I can't understand. Where in the world has that child wandered? Mr. Kellerman, I cannot look after her every minute and take care of the house at the same time. - I have my chores... - Marie, please. I'm not blaming you, tell Mr. Kramer I'll be back shortly. I'm going to find out once and for all where that child goes. Annette! Annette! Annette! Annette! Annette, what are you doing? Hello, daddy! Annette, you come right back here. Come right back here. Annette, my baby. In heaven's name... Whatever possessed you? You might have drowned. I can't drown, daddy. - And why not? - Because I've learned to swim. Is this where you've been coming every day? Yes. Darling, I've got to be very cross with you. You know what the doctor said. That your legs would never be strong enough for... For what other children do. But my legs are strong. The strongest they've been since I was sick. I can even walk better and without my braces. Watch. Swimming can't hurt me. How can anything hurt when it makes you feel so good? Please let me come back here and swim again. Darling, we'll come back here and swim every day. By your victory today, miss Kellerman, you attain permanent possession of this trophy, emblematic of the amateur freestyle championship of new south wales. Thank you. This is getting to be a habit, Annette. What do you do with all these cups? They're crowding dad right out of his study. Thank you. It's a blow to us, Mr. Kellerman. I knew you would understand. Only too well, Mrs. Graves. This financial crisis has affected all of us. I, uh, hope that John won't have to give up his music permanently. I hope not. Goodbye. Goodbye, miss Kellerman. - Bye. - Goodbye, Johnny. Good luck. - Dad? - Hmm? Look. The amateur championship. Permanent possession. Wonderful, darling. I am so proud of you. Oh. You know, why does it always have to be a cup? We could use a new tea service. Oh, speaking of tea, would you like some? Um... No, I don't think so, honey. Thank you. - Annette? - Hmm? I'm, uh, closing the conservatory. The, uh, few pupils we have left hardly pay expenses. Dad. Now, now, now, we're not charity cases yet. I wrote my old friend, Thomas Crocker of the Crocker conservatory in London. He's offered me a post as his assistant. It's a... It's a big move for both of us, I know, but there are times when we have to make decisions and this is the biggest decision of my life. Dad, if it's money, you... you don't have to. Why, I could teach swimming or maybe even turn professional. Th-there were nearly 1,000 people... - no. - ...There at the race today. Darling, swimming is your hobby and I want it to remain just that. It's blessed you with good health and for this, I'm grateful. But as a career, uh, no. Your... your music and... and ballet come first. London will give you a chance to go on with your studies. It may be the best thing for both of us. Well, in that case, what's everyone looking so glum about? One thing I know, dad. The Kellermans will always eat. Oh, yes. Come on, dad, let's walk some more. Bet you've had me around this deck six times since breakfast. - You're acting like an old man. - I am an old man. Hold it, Sydney. Hold it, Sydney boy! - Wait a minute. - Oh, look out! Come back here, you! Sydney! Atta boy, doc. Wait a minute, Sydney! Wait a min... - you okay? - I'll let you know. Oh, wait till I get my dentist bill. - Easy, Sydney boy. - What did I tell you? He's got the greatest left hand in the business. Dynamite in both fists. I'm sorry, folks, I hope he didn't scare you too much but, uh, Sydney gets to feeling his oats every now and then. What's going on here? Did you take that 'roo out of the hold again? Uh, look, purser, I assure you... don't bother to assure me. I've warned you repeatedly. Sullivan, I've had quite enough out of you. That beast is a menace. Only in the prize ring, I assure you. In the prize ring, he's a killer. But, out of the ring, why, he's as gentle as a lamb. - Look, I tell you... - I tell you. You keep that beast below decks or I'll put him off in the next port. And you with him. Don't look at me. This ain't my idea. - Take him below, doc. - Now look, you. You hit me once more when I ain't lookin', so help me I'll kick you right in the pouch. Now, come on, behave yourself. And keep him there. Man's inhumanity to animals. I hope it didn't scare you too much. Oh, no. I'm very fond of kangaroos. Uh, you say he boxes? Boxes? Let me tell you something. This is the greatest act I've ever uncovered. Why, if Sydney were a man he'd be the next champ, take my word for it. Oh, we have no reason not to. Well, sure, he's frisky and full of energy, but out of the ring, why, he wouldn't hurt a flea. Ah. Your friend doesn't seem to think so. Doc? Oh, doc take things too seriously. He's been training fighters for years and he expects the kangaroo to act the same way. As a matter of fact, we were barnstorming with a fighter when we first met Sydney. A middleweight named, uh, tiger Driscold. We'd offer a bonus for anybody who'd go two rounds with him. One day, this fellow comes along leading a kangaroo. One punch, just one punch, mind you. I hocked everything I had to buy him. Well, let's, uh, hope your investment proves a sound risk. Thanks. I have a hunch it's the blue chips this time. Oh, uh, are you bound for London, too? Yes, if this boat ever gets there. My daughter's first visit. She's, uh, going to study for the ballet. Oh, in honor of that, you must be my guest at Sydney's opening. Look me up personally, no charges. - Well, that's very kind of you. - Thank you. Just ask for Jimmy Sullivan. James Sullivan, proprietor of Sullivan's wonder show. Ah, I'm, uh, Frederick Kellerman and this is my daughter, Annette. Annette Kellerman. You're the swimmer. - Uh-huh. - Saw your picture in the paper. That was an awful picture. My daughter has just won the amateur freestyle championship of new south wales. Set a new record in the presence of 2,000 people. - Dad. - But you did. That's a lot of people. Oh, well, swimming's very popular in Australia. I can understand why. Well, nice to have met you, Mr. Sullivan. Uh, I hope Sydney's a big success. Thanks. ♪ Let me call you sweetheart ♪ ♪ I'm in love with you ♪ ♪ let me hear you whisper ♪ ♪ that you love me too ♪ ♪ keep the love light glowing ♪ ♪ in your eyes so true ♪ ♪ let me call you sweetheart ♪ Forgive the intrusion. But would you be interested in a shipboard romance? Oh, hello. You know, I've been standing over there watching you for the past 10 minutes. I know. Women always know when men are watching them. Then maybe you noticed the puzzled look on my face? You know, I kept asking myself how a girl as pretty as you can break swimming records. And how a girl who breaks swimming records can insist on ballet dancing as a career. - What's wrong with the ballet? - Oh, I don't know. I guess I've always associated it with long hair and swans. Oh, and I'm more the duck type? No, what I mean is that... Well, whatever type you are, it must be my type. I meet a girl for the first time two days ago and I can't get her out of my mind. I keep saying to myself "Sullivan, this is without a doubt the prettiest girl you've ever met.“ and a voice comes back. "Nonsense, it's the tropical night, the stars. Your hot jungle blood." And then I reply, "but you've seen tropical nights before and you don't have hot jungle blood. You're just a crazy irishman from Boston who runs a carnival." A-And what reply did you get to that? None. I'm on my own now. Annette, please don't think I'm forward but there's something I must ask you. There's something I must get off my chest. Yes? Annette, I wanna manage you. Manage? Di... did you say manage? Yes. Well, what's the matter? Nothing. I'm sorry. Look, I know a great bet when I see one. If 2,000 people'll come to see you in Sydney five thousand, 10,000 will pay to see you in London. I'll give the act a new twist, a little zip. Not just swimming. Oh, I can see it now. Annette Kellerman, the Australian mermaid. Half-woman, half-fish. I'll build you a little tank and make you up to look like a real mermaid, scaly tail and all. Why, you may be a bigger draw than the kangaroo. - I doubt it. - Good evening. Mr. Sullivan, for your information, my daughter is not half-woman, half-fish. She is, I assure you, all woman. Oh, I couldn't agree with you more. Furthermore, she is not interested in swimming either professionally or as a career, nor in diving into a tank, nor wearing a mermaid's tail. Her sole interest is the ballet. - Mine is music. - But, Mr. Keller... I don't wish to discuss it any further. But, look, this is the greatest idea... - Jimmy. - What's the matter? It's Sydney. He... he... he broke loose again. - Where is he now? - Up on the captain's bridge. Holy smokes! Hold him still, captain! Hold him still! But I... I don't understand. Is there no one running the conservatory now? No one, sir. - I'm the only one here. - Hmm. Since poor Mr. Crocker died, they just closed the place down. I see. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. Annette, I don't know what to say. Most of our funds went for passage. I-It's only one gate that's closed, dad. Don't worry. The Kellermans will always eat. Three, four, five. That's one pound five. There you are, miss. Thank you, Mr. Davis. It's a real big one this time. Mm-hmm. Uh, I-I was wondering, you don't have any connections in the ballet, do you? Yes, dozens of connections. Oh. Oh, well, thank you again, Mr. Davis. Good luck. Greetings. - Why, Jimmy and doc. - Hi, Annette. I'm glad to see you. Yeah, we just dropped by to brush up on our piano lessons. Oh, well... well, won't you come in? Saw the sign outside. Any customers? No, you're the first. Mm. What smells so good? I'm making an Australian stew. Uh, what's that? Same as Irish stew, only the meat's down under. Well, that's too bad, we dropped by to invite you and your father out to dinner. Yeah. Out to di...? Oh, yeah, dinner. We found the nicest little place down on piccadilly. Uh, French cuisine. You weren't gonna do anything of the kind. But you're invited to stay and sample my cooking if you'd like to. Oh, no. We couldn't possibly. No, we wouldn't think of imposing on you. There's plenty, and I insist. Well, I guess it's better than bucking the crowds, dressing and all that. Besides, I'm getting awfully tired of those rich foods. - We'll stay. - Wonderful. Make yourselves comfortable and I'll get things ready. Thanks. By the way, how's Sydney? Oh, sensational. He's developed a one-two punch. Yeah, and I've got the jaw to prove it. Yes, the greatest act ever put under a tent. There's only one thing wrong. No one knows about it. That's where you come in. That's where I come in? We figured if we could get enough people down there the rest would take care of itself. So, we thought maybe if you'd be interested in, uh, well, making a little money. Money? How? Well, the idea I had in mind was a swim down the thames. Maybe five or six miles, ending up at the carnival. We'd follow you in a row boat, of course. Yeah, if Sydney could swim, we wouldn't be bothering you. We'll pay you five pounds and 50 percent of the first day's proceeds. Well, uh, I-If you're going to stage a swim, why don't you make it a real one? What do you mean? Well, that six miles won't impress anybody. But 26 miles might. Twenty-six miles? Holy smoke! I can't even row that far. I can't understand what happened to the reporters. I notified the press. Maybe they thought we were crackpots. I wouldn't blame 'em. Nobody'd ever think of doin' this. I think we'd better start. - How do you feel? - Cold. I can't see two feet ahead of me. Which way do we go? Just point the boat downriver. Ready, honey? - Good luck, honey. - Good luck, Annette. Well, Sydney, here we come. Annette, where are you? Here! Blimey! There's a girl in the water. Look out, Annette! Annette, look out! Hang on, miss. We'll toss you a line! Ne... never mind that. Wh-which way to greenwich? That way. Thank you. Greenwich? Greenwich? Did she say greenwich? How do you feel? I could swim 50 miles in this current. Save your strength, honey. You'll need it when we hit the tides. Great Scott! Look what some girl's trying to do. Get after this story. She'll never get past the tower bridge. Australian girl in marathon swim. Australian girl in marathon swim. Australian... - There she is. - Yes, sir. There's westminster bridge. What are all those buildings? Parliament. And that's big Ben. Beautiful sight, isn't it? I can think of a prettier sight. What's that? Food. I'm starving. We'll eat in a half hour. Keep swimming. Hey, doc, look at all those people. Come on, girl. - There she is. - Yes, sir. There she is. Stick it out! Good girl! Good girl! What about that food? - Doc? - Yeah? Where's the hamper? - What hamper? Oh. - What hamper? The lunch hamper. The hamper with the food you were supposed to bring. Di... didn't you bring it? Didn't I bring it? Maybe if we... maybe if we don't bring it up she'll forget the whole thing. "Maybe she'll forget the whole thing." I can't keep going much longer. Where are we gonna get any grub in the middle of the thames river? I don't know, but we gotta get something or she'll pass out. There's tower port. Drop me off there and I'll see what I can rustle up. What's happening? Where is she? There's the boat. He's coming back. That fat lady gave me this. And the pretty nurse gave me this. Not a bad haul, huh? Yeah, but all that food and nothing to drink. I took care of that, too. Can't you row any faster? What do you think I am, the Cambridge crew? Lunch. Come and get it. Not exactly a seven-course dinner but it's the best I could do. - They just went for food. - She was hungry. She'll never make greenwich. There's a strong tide coming in. She'll make it. She'll make it. That's my daughter, you know. She's my daughter. - Your daughter? - Yeah. Current's turning against her. I hope you know the tide's moving in like a wall. I know when we're licked. Swing alongside of her, doc. We'll pull her in. - Do you mean quit? - That's what I said. Can't let her kill herself for five pounds. Well, maybe if we went... doc, I said, pull her in. That's enough, honey. Come on aboard. - I'll make it. - Don't be silly. There's always another time. No. No... you'll kill yourself fighting this tide. I can't give up now. I just can't. Hey, Jimmy. What's that? Greenwich. It's greenwich. We're just about a mile away. Do you think you can hold out, honey? I'll make it. I-I know I can. What do you think of a girl like that? Daily express. Can you answer a few questions? Can you hold it for a picture, miss Kellerman? - Just for a moment... - gentlemen, please, please. Miss Kellerman is exhausted. Give her a chance to catch her breath. She'll answer all your questions. She'll be over at my office at the carnival. - All right, come on. - Let's follow them. Just take it easy. When did you first begin to get tired, miss Kellerman? Did you swim as far as this in Australia? How long... how long did it take you to train? Give us a good story, miss Kellerman. Please, one at a time. Which question first? Tell us about your training, miss Kellerman. Do you swim every day, do ya? Well, that all depends. Oh, oh, gentlemen. I'm so tired. Kangaroo with a human frame. He weaves, he Bobs, he strikes with the force of a pile... where's the girl who made the swim? Over there. How's the house? Fine, but the people ain't in it. If you ask me, I think we're selling tickets for the wrong attraction. Start the show. I'll see if I can get the press over here. And bring me back some black coffee, will you? I'm dead on my feet. Sullivan, you have to get her out of there. The child's so exhausted, she can barely hold her head up. I'll see what I can do. Yes, I... I was born in Sydney and... And my first distance... all right, gentlemen. That's it for now. Miss Kellerman will be available for further interviews tomorrow. Thank you very much. Goodnight, miss Kellerman. Thank you very much. In the meantime, let me call your attention to another visitor from Australia. Not as pretty as miss Kellerman but in his own way, just as renowned. - Very sorry. - But look, I... aren't you going to see the kangaroo? Poor Sydney. Looks like you really put him out of business. Jimmy. Okay. Okay. Take it easy. Take it easy. Now you're full of ginger. Last night, you couldn't draw a fly. And we're prepared to offer miss Kellerman eight pounds a week for such a series of swims. Well, she's still asleep but I doubt very much that she'd be interested. All right-o, well, if there's any change you can reach me at the daily mirror. "Doubt if she'd be interested?" What are you, nuts? - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning, doc. - Hiya. Good morning. Good morning, Sydney. You can tell your boss he's got the most comfortable bed I ever slept in. You might as well face it, professor. Your daughter here is a celebrated woman. She's already received a dozen offers of employment. - Employment? What kind? - Every kind. Personal appearances, swimming events, diving exhibits. The hedge and hound club wants you to open their duck shooting season. The crystal palace would like to know if you could sing. And then there was a chap here a minute ago from the daily mirror. His paper wants to sponsor a series of swims at beach resorts. Offered eight pounds a week. Well, y-y-you didn't let him get away, did you? You accepted? No. Well, then, which offer did you accept? None. You don't think for a minute I'll let you fall for any of these chicken feed. Eight pounds to swim around the ocean? What kind of a future is there in that? Future? Who's thinking about the future? I am, maybe you don't realize it, but you've struck gold, pay dirt. Those crowds that came last night, they didn't come to see to see the seaweed, they came to see you. And I, for one, intend to see that you capitalize on it. Uh, what do you propose to do? I propose to stage a show. Our own show, a water carnival. - A water carnival? - Why not? It's something brand new. We get a tank and we charge admission. Our own private ocean. Oh, I can see it now. The people flocking to see the gorgeous mermaid from down under. I see something beautiful, something graceful, a ballet. That's it. A water ballet set to music. Just a moment. Uh... All this sounds highly imaginative but where would you stage such an event and... And where can you find a tank big enough for what you describe? The tank is already built and waiting for us. Did you ever hear of the New York hippodrome? The hippodrome? - New York? - My dear boy, really. - Three thousand miles of ocean... - well, what of it? It's the biggest tank in the world and the largest theater in the world. And the longest swim in the world. Surely, you must be joking. How could we get to New York City? Jimmy, it's a wonderful idea but really, dad and I couldn't pay for a trip to liverpool, let alone... who said anything about you paying for this? Anyone who travels with Sullivan travels first class, all expenses paid. Look, I happen to know the owners of the hippodrome personally. Had a concession when they ran Luna park. Now, they're showmen enough to go for this idea in a second. But how could you afford the fares? I thought you were, I-I mean... broke? Perhaps. But Mr. Kellerman, I have such confidence in this idea that I'm willing to sacrifice my entire assets. Hah! What assets? Oh, Jimmy, no. Come here, doc. Look, I want you to put Sydney in the wagon. There's a circus coming to town. I'm sure we can get a good price for him. Sydney? Go ahead. Now, Mr. Kellerman, look. There's lots of things I'd like to discuss with you. This could be... Now, don't take this too hard, old-timer. That's show business. One minute you're up, the next minute you're... Say, maybe you want to go back to the boarding house, huh, Mr. Kellerman? No, no, we said we'd wait for them. I'll be all right. Take it easy, pop. Do you want to sit down? No, no. I'll be all right. You know, this is a big proposition, real big. Don't you worry about Sullivan. He could sell water wings to a duck. I'm becoming aware of that. Here I am, 10,000 miles from home in a strange city, and... Completely dependent upon your persuasive friend. You know, they're... they're liable to be in there for some time, Mr. Kellerman. Come on, we'd better go home. Yeah. Perhaps you're right. Everybody wants to be an impresario. Everybody has the world's greatest idea for the hippodrome. Well, mine isn't the world's greatest, Mr. Harper, but it's a colorful and exploitable package. Oh, it's good. It's one of the best I've heard. And I compliment you on your showmanship. But I can't use it. You can't use it? But... I simply daren't risk it on an unknown girl. Unknown? Take a look at these clippings. They're impressive. They're very impressive, but it happened in London. In New York, the story was just a squib. I can't build a whole show around a swimmer. Annette isn't just a swimmer, Mr. Harper. She's got something very unusual. Ah, I'm sure she has. Mr. Harper, I know that this water carnival idea is... is tailor-made for a place like the hippodrome. Let me put it this way. Right now, the policy of the hippodrome calls for plotted dramas. Spectacles with story. We use our tank for the big climax. But for me to stage a water ballet without even a book... Well, I... I mean, I like it, but... pardon me. Hello. What's that? No, no, no. We have all the confederate uniforms we want. I might be needing some showgirls. Can you do anything besides swim? Oh, I can dance. Well, if you're interested, come back on Monday. It's the best I can do. - I'm sorry. - But, Mr. Harper... by the way, can't you find me a Lincoln that looks like Lincoln? Well, all those characters you dug up look more like the Smith brothers. Yes, I know. Now, look, I've told you what I wanted. Now, this man must be at least... now, if you can't do it, I'll get somebody else. Now, you know what I want... Well, that's that. It isn't your fault, Jimmy. It was a good idea and I went into it with my eyes open. Well, anyway, you can go to work for Harper if you want to. Might not be a bad idea. I don't know what I'm going to do. Probably run up to Boston. A friend of mine owns a concession at revere beach. He wants me to help him ballyhoo it. Jimmy, I have to make some money. It's dad I'm thinking about. You see, music is his whole life. Loving it and teaching it, having his own conservatory. If only I could just give him that much. You can. How? Forget it, I'm not going to sell you on something else and have it fizzle out. Take the Harper job. It's safe in expenses. No. I need more than just expenses. Jimmy, how much can you make out of a concession? If it clicks, plenty. All we have to do is scrape enough money together to buy a little tank, and then we... look, I told you to forget it. It's too much of along shot and I've only got six dollars in my pocket. Well, I still have three silver cups left and then, that would be enough to get us to Boston, wouldn't it? - Maybe. - Well, I-I was just thinking. In London, we swam down the thames to get publicity and that worked pretty well, now, didn't it? Keep talking. Well, suppose we did the same thing here a-a marathon swim from somewhere, anywhere. Not anywhere. From revere beach. Oh, baby, I knew we were a team from the first time I saw you. We'll stand that town on its ear. I'll get enough backing for 10 tanks, not just one. Oh, Jimmy, do you think so? "Think so?" Who's going to stop us? Don't be impatient, fellas. She'll be along in a couple of minutes. Hey, where is she gonna swim to, mister? To that lighthouse, way out there and back. - Gee, that must be 50 miles. - Twenty miles. What you got in the basket, mister? Take your hands off the hamper! Come on, now, get out of here. Go on, beat it, you little monster. I don't believe it. Did you see that? Her legs are bare. She ought to be arrested. Oh, look at her. - Wake up. Wake up! - What is it? What is it? - Whoa! - I don't believe it. Let's hurry. Don't let them bother you. They'll be cheering you when you finish your swim. - Shocking. - On a public beach. Wake up. Wake up. Oh. The row boat's all ready. Colder out here than it is in the water. Well, honey. This is it. - Good luck, Annette. - Thanks, doc. I'll need it. Don't worry about anything. Just start the swim. It's disgraceful. Arrest that woman. Halt! Just a minute. Just a minute. Just a minute, miss. What do you think you're doing? Officer, this is Annette Kellerman, the famous Australian swimmer. She's about to embark on a 20-mile swim. - Not in that outfit. - What? You don't expect me to go 20 miles on one of those things, do you? All I expect you to do, miss, is cover yourself up. Come on, Jimmy. Let's get out of here. Not on your life. You've done nothing wrong and I won't let anyone intimidate you. Just a minute. Just a moment. Indecent exposure. Held for trial. Oh, those hypocrites. Sanctimonious bluenose hypocrites. How dare they? - Oh, dad, what are we going... - now, now, now, now. Hey, the lobby's full of reporters and cameramen. They'd like to know if they can come up. Well, you just tell them to go away. Tell them I've left town. I never want to see Boston again. I-I'll just swim someplace else. Wrong. You'll swim right here. As far as I'm concerned, this is the greatest thing that's ever happened. "The greatest... “ I-I'm booked and... and fingerprinted and... and arrested just like a common... well, what of it? Don't you realize that you're the standard-bearer for all American womanhood? In your hands lies the power to wreck the shackles of prudery. Free the feminine sex from the armor of convention. Go ahead, run away if you want to. But I tell you, this is more than a trial. More than a newspaper headline. This is a crusade. Bravo. Huh? I said bravo. This tempest over a bathing suit It's... It's... I-It's medieval. It should be exposed to the world. And I, for one, intend to see that my daughter stays and fights this thing through. - Hear, hear! - Attaboy, pop. It's high time American women showed they had some skin. It's up to you, darling. You can pay the fine and leave Boston tonight or you can stay and accept the challenge. Indecent tell those reporters to come up. I-I'll give them a story bathing suit and all. And as prosecutor for this county, I demand the severest possible penalty for this brazen young woman who has wantonly flaunted every statute of decency. She, and others like her, must learn that laws are made to be observed. Her guilt is incontestable. She admits that she wore the indecent garment in question. - I admit no such thing. - What's that? Do you deny that you appeared at revere beach in a flimsy piece of material that barely covered your... I admit I wore a one-piece bathing suit. I do not admit it was indecent. What other definition would you apply? Your arms, neck, and shoulders were exposed. Not to mention your calves and thighs. My ankles were also exposed. Not to mention my toes, knees and fingers. I also notice your teeth are exposed. Does that make you indecent? Your honor. Your honor, if you please. This woman's deliberately trying to make a mockery of this court. I wouldn't be surprised if those pickets are outside at her instigation. This flagrant disrespect... I object, your honor. Are you the attorney for the defendant? No. Then keep your seat or I shall have to eject you. Miss Kellerman, it's not the intention of this court to take sides in what is essentially feminine debate. You're charged with, uh... Uh, indecent exposure to which you pleaded... Not guilty, sir. Your honor, her appearance at the beach was witnessed by hundreds of people, including the police officer. I am aware of that. Have you anything further to add, miss Kellerman? Well, yes, your honor, I have. You see, I've been swimming in competition all my life a-and the only way I've been able to compete successfully is... is by wearing a man's one-piece racing suit. After all, sir, you can't deny me my right to swim, can you? Certainly not. Well, then, how is it possible to... to swim a race tied up in a corset and 10 yards of wet drapery? Miss Kellerman, let me remind you that it is not I who am on trial. I'm sorry, your honor. May I please ask the court one more question? Proceed. Well, do the authorities object to the one-piece bathing suit or to the fact that the limbs are not entirely covered? I see no reason to base any decision on the number of pieces in an article of clothing. Well, then perhaps I could suggest a compromise. Proceed. Thank you. This is the original racing suit except that I've... I've sewn some stockings on the bottom and a Jersey on the top. As you can see, this will cover the entire body except the forearms and the head. I consider that shocking, your honor. I consider it very ingenious. Is it my understanding that any further swimming appearances will be made in a, uh... Bathing suit of that nature? Yes, your honor. Case dismissed. Doc} Hurry, hurry, hurry. Hurry, hurry. Step right up, folks. The next show in five minutes. All right, folks, step right up. See Annette Kellerman in that one-piece bathing suit. The next show in five minutes. Step right up, friend. How many? Thank you, sir. The next show in five minutes. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. See Annette Kellerman in that one-piece bathing suit. Ladies and gentlemen, introducing Australia's mermaid, Annette Kellerman. Voted by Harvard university as the world's most perfect woman. World's champion swimmer, holder of records from 100 yards to 26 miles. Miss Annette Kellerman. Miss Kellerman will now demonstrate the various swimming strokes. The breast stroke. The over arm stroke. For the first time in america, the Trudgen stroke. This stroke was used by miss Kellerman when she made her sensational swim in the thames river in London, england. And now, for the first time in america, miss Kellerman introduces her famous Australian crawl. And now, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in the usa, a woman will give a public exhibition of fancy high-diving. Miss Kellerman will now demonstrate the front back dive. Step right up, folks. The show is now going on. See Annette Kellerman in her one-piece bathing suit. - Step right up. - Attaboy, doc. Attaboy, talk it up. Six weeks, doc. Make it seven. Every suit a different color. Hello, Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy, I'm soaking wet. Good. Maybe it'll put the fire out. Go. Go. Think it over, Sullivan. I'm leaving for Florida tonight. I could use a guy like you. Put it the other way, bud, and I might be interested. Which way? Maybe I could use a guy like you. Hey, you know, sometimes, I wish we had Sydney back. We didn't make as much money, but I didn't have all this th-th-this bookkeeping. And what's this item here, personal, 200 dollars? Is, uh, this personal enough? Hey, no kiddin'. - Did you ask her yet? - Today's the day. Season here closes real soon, and I... and you want somebody to keep your feet nice and warm at night. Great, but what about me? Doc, I've got an idea for something brand new. A great idea. A swimmer and a flyer. A flyer? That bud Williams act is dynamite. You know, he can actually take that contraption 400 feet off the ground? I don't like it. It's against nature. Oh, you and your grousing. Can't you see that big new poster? "Sullivan's combined shows. King of the air, queen of the sea." Oh, don't get me wrong now. Annette will still be our number one attraction. But we can dream, can't we? There she is, dreamer. - Hi, there. - Hello, Jimmy. I'm not late, am I? Performance starts at 2:30. Oh, uh, Jimmy, this is Mr. Aldrich of the Aldrich lecture bureau. He was kind enough to drive me back from luncheon. - My pleasure. - How do you do? I have a special interest in miss Kellerman. I'm trying to persuade her to go on a tour. What kind of a tour? Well, he's offered me a great deal of money and a 10-week guarantee, just to do a series of lectures. Yes, indeed. I see miss Kellerman in a very dignified presentation giving a lecture on the body beautiful. Perhaps even a little ballet appropriate to the subject. Ballet? Lecture? Oh, no. Well, what's so funny? Well, darling, I'm sorry, but one of us must be nutty. You competing with William Jennings Bryan? Oh, I can see you now, up on the platform with a pitcher of water in a ballet, dancing around some gauze drapes. Holy smoke. I'm happy to be contributing so much to your amusement, Mr. Sullivan. But I assure you, mine is a very dignified and lucrative business. Miss Kellerman will not be swimming around in a tank, like a seal, performing in a carnival with a fat lady on one side and a fire-eater on the other. You don't like carnivals, eh? They have their place. And, uh, you don't like swimming around in tanks either? For a fish, yes. For a beautiful woman like miss Kellerman... Mr. Aldrich, uh, I think it's about time that you learn to enjoy water. Jimmy, Jimmy, stop that. You hear me? Jimmy, come off it! Jimmy, let go off him. Let go. All right. Run along, Sonny, and take your gauze drapes with you. Jimmy, how dare you? Mr. Aldrich, I'm terribly sorry. Go over there and sit down. Annette, put on your suit. The show starts in 20 minutes. Yes? Jimmy. Annette, I'm sorry. That big trap of mine. I guess I'll never be able to control it. Oh, darling. We shouldn't quarrel, not about this. It's just not important enough. I don't get you. We came up here purely and simply for money. Anything that offers us more money is more important. You still got that Aldrich deal on your mind, haven't you? Darling, it's 500 dollars a week. Puts me just that much closer to the Kellerman conservatory. It isn't as though we were splitting up. I'll talk to Aldrich. I'm sure there'd be an important job for you. Like filling the water pitchers? - Jimmy. - Or pinning up the drapes? Or maybe I could come out ahead of you and give a short talk on how high class we all are. Baby, somewhere along the line, we got our signals crossed. You've got it into your head that you're Joan of arc. Well, get it out fast. You're a swimmer doing a tank act in Sullivan's water carnival, and not a bad show either. And how long can it last? After all, all we're doing is capitalizing on a lot of cheap bathing suit publicity. Well, what do you think this Aldrich thing is anyway? All he's trying to do is cash in on the same dodge. A ballyhoo that I arranged. That you arranged? Sure. Who do you think got that cop to arrest you? Oh, no, Jimmy, you didn't. Didn't I? Can you stand there... what about all that talk of a crusade and... bunk. Who cares what a lot of females wear on the beach as long as I can keep you in a one-piece bathing suit? Baby, you're a swimmer. You belong in the water. Wet, you're terrific. Dry, you're just a nice girl who ought to settle down and get married. Well, thank you very much for the advice. One thing I know for sure, if and when I do get married, it will never be to a... a cheap, stubborn, flea circus proprietor. This flea circus does all right for the fleas in it except when they jump out of their cages. Ballet. Comics wanting to play Hamlet. Toe dancing. She's had that bug in her head ever since we first met. Well, miss Kellerman may be able to swim but she'll never fly. What are you talking about? Jimmy, no. Look at these receipts. Look at these books. Here, look, nothing but money, money, money. There's plenty more where that came from. I'd be a sucker to go ahead and make big plans that depends on the whim of a girl with nutty notions about herself. Hey, look, pal, y-you ain't serious, are ya? Hey, you're kidding, Jimmy. Huh? Tell me you're kiddin'. I'll be back in a few minutes. Flea circus. Flea circus, she calls us. And then, my dear, you will come forward in a tasteful evening gown against a background of perhaps a small salon orchestra. Your talk will be prepared, of course, subject to your approval. And as for the dancing... Mr. Aldrich, I'm terribly sorry, but... Well, I-I just can't see myself doing that sort of thing. My dear child, it's natural to be nervous and I understand. - But now, if you will only let... - please. I have a headache. Perhaps we could talk about it some other time. But I have to make preparations. Well, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you'd better hold up on them for a while. Goodnight, miss Kellerman. Goodnight, Mr. Aldrich. - Good evening. - Good evening. Annette. Read this. It's from the New York hippodrome. "New hippodrome policy will feature great specialty a... Can you come to New York to discuss deal? Alfred Harper." Oh, dad, the New York hippodrome. Yes. Well, this is just what Jimmy... What is it, my dear? Oh, dad. Oh, so that's it. Well, you better let him read it, too. There's nothing like good news to patch up a lovers' quarrel. Come on, now. Off you go. Miss Kellerman? Oh, hello, Andy. Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you were on your way to Florida with Mr. Sullivan. Florida? Well, that's what he said. You mean, you didn't know? Oh, yes, yes, of course, I knew, Andy. How stupid of me. Thank you, Andy. - Madame pavlova. - Yes? I-I'm Annette Kellerman. Indeed, I know, my dear. I have watched your performance. W-Well, all I wanted to tell you was that... Well, all my life I've wanted to be able to dance like you. You studied for the ballet? Yes. My dear, don't ever think that your studies have been in vain. Your act is wonderful. You have applied your ballet training to something new and different. They tell me there is only one pavlova. But from what I have seen they may someday say the same thing about you. There is only one Annette Kellerman. I wish she hadn't told you that. Oh! Hello, Alfred. Here I am with next season's contract still unsigned and people like pavlova may start puffing you up. Oh! No. No, I'd almost work at the hippodrome for nothing. There's no need for that, Annette. You've really been great. And this is the best way I know of saying it. - Oh, Alfred. - Don't thank me. Thank all the people who came to see you. Annette, I'm giving a little supper for pavlova. Saturday night after the performance. Can you come? Well, may I let you know? I don't get it. Are you in mourning, or are you just a hermit? - Oh, well, no... - Mr. Kellerman. I am trying to persuade your elusive daughter to come to a party, and it seems I can't... of course, she'll go. It'll do you good, darling. You've been seeing too little of New York and too much of an elderly musician. And besides, orders are orders. Mr. Harper's my new boss. - Boss? - Mm-hmm. I've been asked to work with the hippodrome orchestra next season. Oh, dad. Let's hope it's only the beginning, sir. The hippodrome needs your kind of talent. Thank you. Thank you very much. Gotta keep the Kellermans happy. The man in my box office told me so. I'll see you later. Bye, Alfred. Dad, I-I think it's just so exciting and wonderful. The two of us here, working together. I couldn't be happier. Couldn't you? I've got the report. He went to Florida with that, uh, flying act. And, uh, William smashed up the second day. Well... where is he now? Well, this report says he was in New Orleans for a while with a wrestling bear, then up in Chicago with some kind of a concession that closed. Dad, I-I-I've just got to find him. That argument we had was so stupid and silly. This whole thing, the hippodrome, it was Jimmy's idea. Darling, you mustn't confuse love and loyalty. You owe nothing to anybody in the world. Not to me or anybody. Jimmy knows that, too. - Does he? - Deep in his heart, he does. I'm sure that's the reason for his absence. He wants to make good without Annette Kellerman. He feels you don't need him. Dad, I do need him. I... I know, but that's the way Sullivan is. And he's no different from most of his sex. Darling, that's the price a woman pays for achievement. He'll come to you when he has something to offer, but not before. It's a long gamble, I'll admit. A thousand-to-one shot that may never come off. The only thing you can be sure of is that he'll be trying. Hello, Marceline. - Annette. - Alfred, what is it? Wha... what's the matter? Dad! Poor old guy. He was okay. He never did get his conservatory. Wish he had. Ain't you gonna go and see her? Nope. - Say... say, Jimmy? - Yeah. Look, pal, y-you and me, we've been around together for a long time. Well, s-sometimes I grouse, I admit it, but... but you know I'd... I'd give my right arm for ya. What are you getting at? Well, you ain't really serious about going ahead with this scheme, are you? You bet your life I am. If I ever get this egg crate off of the ground we're gonna hit pay dirt. I hope that's all we hit. Aerial sensational cross-country air race. Read about it! Read about it. Cross-country air race. Fifty thousand dollars in prizes. Read about it. - Good evening, Mr. Harper. - Good evening. Good evening, miss Kellerman. Good evening. Did you hear about the cross country air race? There's 50,000 dollars in cash prizes. - Oh, that's all right. - No, no, take it. Well, thank you. Crazy fools, they'll all be killed. Ah, it's mad, but what a stunt. - Good evening, miss Kellerman. - Hello. Hello, Max. Well, doc. Hello, Annette. C-Can I talk to you for a second? Oh, excuse me, Alfred. This is an old friend of mine, doc Cronnol. Mr. Harper. - How are you? - Glad to meet you. I'll see you later, dear. Fine, fine. Well, come on. Come on in and tell me all about yourself. - Oh, there's nothing... - how've you been? - Fine. Fine. - How's Jimmy? Well, that's why I'm here. I-I hate to bother you, Annette but... But somebody's gotta talk him outta that thing. - What thing? - That bughouse air race. He's got his eye on that 50,000-dollar pot and... doc, Jimmy? Oh, you mean... you mean, he's in... He's going to fly to California? Well, he's gonna try. And you should see in what. Y-Y-You can't even steer the thing. Y-You swing it around with... with ropes over your shoulders. Oh, doc, he... he'll smash himself to pieces. That's what I've been trying to tell him. But... but you know that Sullivan. I... I just thought maybe there was something you could figure out. Well, when does he plan to take off? Anytime now. Maybe even tomorrow if the weather's right. We've been sleeping next to the machine out of Montauk point. Oh, doc, I-I've got a performance tonight. Don't you worry, I'll be there. - I'll figure out something. - Gee, thanks, Annette. Bye-bye, doc. Oh, don't... don't tell him I came here. I-I'm in enough trouble now. Oh, sure, sure, doc. - Bye. - Bye. Well, it looks like it's lifting. Okay, Mac. Clear the field. We're gonna take off. Jim, don't you think we oughta wait a little while? I-It might rain. Ah, the weather's perfect. Please, I'm sorry. Excuse me, please. N-Nobody gets through, miss. - He's gonna take off. - But, officer, I... I'm sorry. Hey. Hey, nobody gets through. Stand back. - Thank you. - Keep going, Sullivan. Bring me an orange from California, Jimmy. - Good luck, Jim. - I'll need it. - Best of luck, Jim. - Thank you. Jimmy. Hello, sweetness. How's everything? I heard you were at the hippodrome. She snuck past, Mr. Sullivan. Shall I let her stay? Sure, why not. She's a famous personality, Annette Kellerman. Well-known lecturer. Jimmy Sullivan, I don't care what happens to you, but, well, doc is a friend of mine and I forbid you to take him on this flight. See what I mean? Greatest lecturer of her day. You heard me. I-I'm not gonna have them finding doc's broken body, crushed and mangled, somewhere in the rocky mountains. Ah, that's very sweet of you, baby, but you don't have to worry about doc. He's not leaving the ground. He's driving the emergency repair car. That's me, still the guy in the rowboat. - All clear, Mr. Sullivan. - Right. Jimmy, please don't force me to take drastic action. What's that? I said don't force me to take drastic action. I've never forced you to do anything, baby. Remember? Okay, doc. Let's go. Here's a summons, Mr. Sullivan. Your flying machine and all equipment has been attached. What? Go away. - Sorry. It's a court order. - Court order for what? Non-payment of monies owed to Annette Kellerman. I had an accounting of all the books while you ran the concession. Among other items, there's one marked "two hundred dollars, personal.“ you'll have to explain that. Oh, yes. I'm sorry. Here's the item. You can sell it somewhere. Okay, doc. Let's go. Clear the field, lady. Thanks for tryin', honey. Switch on! Turn it over. They say that frenchman has the best chance of winning. - I'm backing Rogers. - Well, what about Sullivan? Sullivan? In that crackerbox, I don't see how he's gotten as far as he has. I'll say one thing for this air race. It's certainly captured the attention of the country. I'm sorry, Alfred. You want very much for him to win, don't you? I? Well, of course. I-I mean... You figure he'll have 50,000 dollars. He can come to you, carry you off on a white charger. All very simple. The American success story. Darling, I know how importantly this man looms in your life. But allow me the privilege of knocking my competition. Maybe he will win that pot. I hope he does. But it still won't work. You're big-league. And Sullivan, he's a will-o'-the-wisp a carney man. He'll always be up there in the clouds looking for that fast dollar. The big ballyhoo that'll make him a seven-day wonder. It probably isn't news that I love you very much. What's most important, I think I can make you happy. Will you marry me, Annette? Alfred, believe it or not, this... this is the first marriage proposal I've ever had. It's... it's a little overpowering. Well, then say yes. Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt for a moment to bring you the latest bulletin on the great cross-country flying race. Now, five contestants are still in the running. We have news of three of them. Bob Giff, travelling eastward, has logged 500 miles from golden gate park, San Francisco. Cal Rodgers, in his Vin Fiz, has just reached Elmira, New York. And James Darley, in his Chester biplane, is nearing buffalo. Now, three other flyers have been forced out, including Jimmy Sullivan, who's reported injured in a smash-up. However, our report says he managed to right the machine and balanced it down to a landing in a town called grover's junction, where he's been hospitalized. Alfred, I've... I've got to get to a telephone. Hello? Hello? Yes, this is the grover memorial hospital. I'd like to inquire about James Sullivan. Oh, yes, the flyer. No, he wasn't badly injured. We patched up his arm and he left. Well, where did he go? C-Can you tell me? No, I'm sorry. Neptune's daughter. That's what I'd call the picture. It's a natural for Kellerman. And for our underwater shots in Hollywood, I'd build a giant glass tank. We could shoot right through the glass into Neptune's cave. Hmm, sounds very interesting. Oh, it's a great challenge and a wonderful new medium. Movies are growing bigger every day. Really, if you could persuade... have you talked to miss Kellerman? I thought you were handling her affairs. Well, don't let that fool you. I advise her, but she's a lady who makes up her own mind. Still, it might be a good change for her. Might even be a good change for me. For you? Oh, a trip to California, two of us. Just thinking. There's a party going on backstage. A special performance for the kids at the orthopedic hospital. It's Annette's idea. Can you join us? I wish I could, but I'm meeting my wife. - Christmas shopping. - Oh, that's too bad. Looks like fun for the children. Annette's a wonderful woman. I'm sorry you can't join us, Mr. Garvey, but I'll be in touch with you later. I'm counting on you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. And I've got a top for you. That's a spinning one. Know how to work it? That's good. Now, better find... here's a circus wagon. Oh, this is fun. Better find a Dolly in a blue dress for you here. There it is. Another circus wagon. There's a green one. Here is... oh, look at that silly elephant. Isn't that the cutest? This is for you, darling. Isn't she lovely? It's a wonderful party, Annette. Oh, hello, Alfred. Only I'm a little jealous. Everybody's had a Christmas present but me. Oh, poor Alfred. What would you like? An answer to that question I asked you last June. In offering these genuine Indian blankets for the ridiculous sum of three dollars and 50 cents, I can assure you, sir, you are getting one of the greatest bargains since Manhattan island went for 24 dollars. Yeah, but I have no use for a blanket. Ah, no use perhaps for an ordinary blanket but these ancient items are hand-loomed on the reservation by gifted navajos one of whom you see here beside me. May I present chief thunderbird. How. Chief, what is your opinion of this product? Product good. Now, please, please, leave me alone. I am not cold. I don't want a blanket. Oh, then perhaps you'd be interested in one of these beautiful signet rings. Hand-carved by Indian maidens. I don't want anything. I just want to be left alone. Now, please, please, get outta here! Very well. Good day, sir. Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon, madam. I... Annette. Hello, doc. Uh, your feather's crooked. Oh. - Jimmy. - How are you, Sullivan? Come on in. Sit down. How. How. Uh, th-they're very nice. Uh, are... are they hand-loomed? Oh, these? Oh, I'm just, uh, helping out a friend of mine. A... a fellow named Fred Harvey. He got himself overloaded with a big stock of this stuff and, well, he just sort of asked me if I would help him get rid of 'em. I, I, uh... Read about you getting married. Yes. Good idea. It's about time you start raising a family of little swimmers. - Congratulations. - Thank you. All the luck in the world, Annette. Well, we're not taking the big jump until Annette finishes her picture here. Oh, you're making picture, huh? Yes. Neptune's daughter. Good. Glad to hear it. It's great future. As a matter of fact, I got some picture plans myself. Got a new star signed up, he's on the train. We... Jimmy, if... if I could be of any help, I... oh, no. I'm in good shape. I got some important contacts on the coast. Well, it's nice seeing you. Nice running into you. - Best of luck, Annette. - Thank you, doc. Oh, there you are. Didn't I warn you about taking this dog out of the baggage car? Just a moment, conductor. This isn't just an ordinary dog. This is a highly-trained animal who's gonna be a movie star in six months. I don't care if he's Francis x bushman. He doesn't belong in the lower berth frightening the passengers. And as for you, you look like the man I kicked off in Albuquerque. Me? Well, that's perfectly ridic... how. Don't give me that how business. You haven't paid your fare and... just a moment, conductor, look. Couldn't we discuss this somewhere else? You know, you're probably not aware of it, but there's a new act just passed by congress. An Indian on his way to his reservation is entitled to free transportation. - I know of no such act. - I resent your tone, sir. If it's a matter of money, well, I've got plenty of cash here in my briefcase. - You better have. - Oh, this is ridiculous. Absolutely absurd. Would you like me to see what I can do for them? No. No, I'll do it. Forgive me, Alfred. - Yale, did you say? - Yale, Harvard, Princeton. Take your pick. 'You want your sons to have a college education, don't you?' - of course. - And can you manage it on your salary? You know darn well I can't. All right, then. Be smart. The moving picture business is growing fast and this dog's gonna take the country by storm. Watch. Burglar. Pretty girl. He certainly is clever. Clever? You haven't seen one-tenth of his bag of tricks. And remember this, no overhead, no salary, no expenses other than his food, and it's not gonna cost you one dime. I'm gonna cut you in simply for being a good sport. Well... I can't very well put you off in the middle of the desert. How. Let's have a good scene now, boys. Make the audience believe it. Make them believe it. Now, take in the money. Play that piano a little louder. That's it. Hey, Arthur. About ready with that set? All right, come on. Liven it up. Let's get going. Girls, get in your position. Let's run through it once again. Sam, come over here. Come on, move it along, will ya? Hurry it up. Joe, get over there and help 'em, will you? We haven't got all day. Come on. The hippodrome was never like this, was it? Frankly, no. You people don't stay in one spot long enough to get acquainted. Well, with luck, we're through today. When I tell you that I have never been so high on a picture you can believe me. Annette is simply wonderful. Now, if I could persuade you two to postpone your honeymoon. We leave tonight. Oh, well, I was only thinking out loud. Let's get some more seaweed around that cave. Keep that water coming. It's holding 50,000 gallons now. - Can't we raise the level? - That's glass, you know. We built it pretty solid but why take chances? All right, you're the doctor. So, bill, do you think we can go for a take? Anytime. - Robbie. - Yes, sir? Miss Kellerman in five minutes. - Yes, sir. - I'll get her. Well, thanks, Mr. Harper. - Yes? - You're wanted on the set, darling. Oh, all right, I'm ready. Come in, Alfred. Neptune's daughter. Oh, Alfred, be careful. My make-up. Well, this is it, sweetheart. Garvey says you're all through after this scene. You've been very patient with all this, Alfred. It's just a pose. I've never been more impatient in my life. Is this what you're looking for? Oh, yes. Yes, i-it's sort of a good luck charm, I... I wear it whenever I'm performing a stunt and I... silly, isn't it? Well. Yeah, sure. Ready, Annette? - Ready. - Okay. Let's get it the first time. Places, everybody! Good luck, honey. When you get up to the top, wave if you can't hear me. Right. All right, come on. Come on. Move it along, boys, will ya? All right, get that stuff out of here. Come on. Come on. Hurry it up. Clear the tank! Girls, get ready! Now remember, everybody. As soon as she comes out of the cave, dive down and join. Now stand by. Let's get it the first take. Annette, can you hear me? Come forward a little bit. - Whoa. That's it. - Okay, we got her now. - Okay, bill? - Okay. - Ready, sir? - All right! Music. Camera. Action! All right, girls. Get ready! The glass is splitting! Get her out of there! - Look out! - Miss Kellerman! Get her out of there! Get her out of there! - Watch out. Watch out. - Get the boards out. Are you okay? Please, nurse, I must see her. I've been waiting here every day for the past two weeks. I'm sorry, sir. Strict orders have been issued. No visitors. Let me talk to the doctor. If you'll wait, I'll try to get a report for you. Hello, Sullivan. - Mr. Harper, I... - I know. Come along with me. It's all right, grace. How is she? We'll know this morning. Oh. - Good morning, Mr. Harper. - Good morning. Doctor Vance is in miss Kellerman's room. Thank you. - Good morning, doctor. - Good morning. This is Mr. Sullivan. - Mr. Sullivan. - How do you do? - Is there any news? - She's resting comfortably. I think we were wise to operate. When will she be able to leave the hospital? I don't know. I don't know. Mr. Harper, I think I can speak plainly. Miss Kellerman's spine has suffered a severe blow, what we call a spinal cord hematoma now, we've relieved the pressure, and fortunately there was no severance to the nerve tracts, but... She will have to face the possibility that she may not have the use of her legs for some time. Did you tell this to her? She insisted on knowing and I saw no reason to withhold it. I'd rather she didn't have any visitors right now. I understand. Thank you. I know how much of a blow this is, Mr. Harper, but whatever is humanly possible to do, we'll do for her. The rest is up to miss Kellerman. Her own recuperative powers, her health, her will. Thank you, doctor. I know we're in very capable hands. We'll check with you later in the day. Very well. Well, I... Perhaps you would like to sleep for a while. Hello, baby. I was just passing the hospital, I thought I'd look in. Jimmy. I've been here every day for the past two weeks. That nurse downstairs is a clam. She wouldn't tell me anything. You're... you're looking swell. I-I feel fine. A little rocky, maybe but... I'm gonna be up and around in no time at all. That's great. I-It's just a sprain or some such thing. - How's doc? - Fine. - A-And... and your picture? - Wrapped up, all finished. We're taking the print to New York tonight. Oh. I've heard nothing but good things about it. Imagine starring a dog. Ah, what's his name? Rin tin tin. What a funny name. - Chinese? - French. Annette, darling. Jimmy. Baby, don't let it get to you, please. That doctor, he may know medicine, but there's lots of things about people he doesn't know. He doesn't know about a little girl in a small inlet back in Australia. They told her the same thing, too. He doesn't know how she hobbled every day to the water... Learning to swim before she could walk. How she became the greatest aquatic star in the world. Oh, there's lots of things that doctors don't know, including what I once told you. Wet, you're terrific. Dry, you ought to marry some guy and settle down. Jimmy, I... Well, I just wanted to tell you... That you're gonna beat this thing, baby, you and Harper. - He's a terrific guy. - Unlucky is a better word. Alfred... What Sullivan says is right, darling. You'll beat this thing. The same way you've beaten everything else. As for you, I don't know why you should get this kind of a break. You don't rate it. You struck gold once and never had the sense to stake a claim. You're a crazy, vagabond irishman with both feet planted firmly in mid-air. But you're what the doctor ordered. Just see that you make her happy. Alfred. Goodbye, darling. You'll be up and around soon rehearsing a new act. And when you do, remember, I'm holding you to your contract with the hippodrome. Oh, yes. This doesn't belong to me. It doesn't belong to you either.
