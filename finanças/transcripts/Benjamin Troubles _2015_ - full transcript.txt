Okay, this one? This is the original of the, you see how all the pieces look the same? Mm-hmm.

Terrell was on a trip to Montreal and was taking a lot of acid and reading the bible, and he came up with this. And then he painted all these companion pieces years and years later, and so this became holographics one, that's holographics two, that's holographics three, and so on. What about the sculpture over there? Which one? That one there? The one over there. Um, shit. Well, I know about the paintings. Let's get out of here. Come on. Huh? Come on, let's get out of here.

Right, this shit wasn't just complicated, but it was also problematic, hence, problemated. Yeah, he used to get so pissed off. He'd say, "Oh, the engine's problemated!" What? I'm gonna start using that word. Listen, I gotta go to the bathroom first. I gotta drop a deuce like nobody's business. What the, what the fuck? How'd you get in my apartment? Hey, how long have you been here? For a while. I heard your voice and I knew that I had to leave him. Time out, time out, leave him, who? You know you can't trust Mrs. Tony Montano over here, okay?

I'm so happy to see you too. ♫ I remember a song from nowhere ♫ I expected to be wrong ♫ We had questions ♫ We had a good thing beneath ♫ We were kids ♫ We were remembering memories ♫ How can I thank you, my darling ♫ For all the love and the silence ♫ How can I thank you, my love ♫ For all the records you have done ♫ We believed in the summer ♫ Breaking bottles through the glass ♫ We believed in no future ♫ Oh, until we were building one ♫ How can I thank you, my darling ♫ For all the love and the silence ♫ How can I thank you, my love ♫ For all the records you have done ♫ For all the records you have done ♫ For all the records you have done Morning. Morning. You make a noise, you're like. It's really cute though. I watched you do it for a while. You were really cute too. With your jeans. - My jeans? - Yeah. Yeah, well they're like pajamas. Yeah, I see that. I think you keep them on to protect me. What is this? That's money. Yeah, I see that. You had no money in your pocket last night. Did you do a deal last night? No. Do you wanna explain this then? When you were little, did the tooth fairy ever visit you? Yes, but what does that have to do with any of this? Just let me finish. So you'd put your tooth under the pillow and in the morning, what would be there? Money. And how would it get there? My father would come in at night and... The tooth fairy would sneak in in the middle of the night. Yes, when I was little, the tooth fairy would come in and... She was real for you then, right? Yes, but I grew up. What if that magic came with you into your adult life? It didn't. I don't know. What if it did come with you? I want you to do something for me, okay? Trust me, close your eyes. Just close your eyes. What if she was here right now and she put $100 in my pocket every hour? Open them and look at the clock over there. $100. Every hour. Really? You're gonna tell me a stupid story? What is wrong with you? Are you okay? - It's the truth. - No, it is not the truth. That's ridiculous, it's a ridiculous story. Baby, hold on to my hand for a second. Okay, look at the clock. Just put it in my pocket with me. Wait. You feel that? This is the next number in the sequence. The tooth fairy's real, baby. Had love, yeah. Hey, man. - Morning. - Morning. Alright, we got some breakfast for you guys. Oh, thank you. So I told her. You told her? He showed me. You showed her? Okay, cool, she knows. There's no way you believed him when he told you. No, not at all. I thought he was punking me and was about to punch him in the face. Quick note, how are my sheets? Okay, never mind, never mind, so, boys and girls, I need you to listen up. I have diversified. I've constructed a five-point plan that is impossible to penetrate. See this is why I brought my boy in on this. Yes. Okay, this is going down. So where are we going? Okay, we are gonna take all the money that we're going to get and place it into bonds, specific bonds. High yield, high risk, and it all starts tonight at Blazer's. You're fucking with me. No, no, no, no, man, listen, this is how we're gonna clean him out. This is how it's gonna get done. Quick sum of money in a small time frame. Wait a minute, what is Blazer's? Okay, this guy named Blazer, he hosts a poker night. Blazer's is high risk, man. We're not wasting our money there. This is how we're gonna close our capital. This is how we invest. Listen, it's gonna be great. I've got it all mapped out and I think she should come along. Actually I think it should go well. Yeah! See, she's already on board. Otis, door. What up, dude? Thanks for not being on time. Did your Ford Escort break down? We're right on time man, I don't know what time you're on. Yeah, Blazer, right on time to take money from your poor sorry ass. I'll give you a tour of my uber condo later, but you look good, man, you look snazzy. I like this whole paisley thing. I'm not playing, man, and I'm not dealing, so don't make any assumptions. - You got it. - You look good too. You got sweater, khaki, homosexual thing going on. Thinking of getting a Van Zandt over here and I'm thinking of getting a Rochon over there. They're so expensive, but whatever. - Oh come on man, really? - Yes. You brought the fuckin' French guy back? Yes, yes, yes. But he's not gonna take your money tonight. I am, baby. Welcome to our little game, where time truly is money. We have some new meat tonight. We have Miles, Ben, and Nova. You know, just play it by ear. I know. So who's the banker? Nova, just like the car, fellas. Big D, you know the countries are always so... Is that your real name? You would probably laugh if you heard it, so I changed it to Nova when I was young. Let's play cards. Indeed. Call. This isn't the Genius Bar at Apple, make a move D. It's my fuckin' hand, let me think about it. Eight more. I'm in. The lovely Nova, where do you stand? I stand five feet, eight inches, but in heels, I raise my height. Ow. I think you're bluffing Miss Espana. So I call. Too steep for me. D, what's your status? About 25 in the pot? Alright, pot's good, let's see a river. Fucking A. Rock and roll, who's got pocket kings, biatches? I fold. Fuck it, I'm all in. I'm all in, just like a little baby alligator, flushed down the toilet. It's just a game, right boys? Play or get played. Is that what you guys say? Smoking a pair, fuck it. Show 'em. Straight flush. Fuck me! Donkey's balls, man. Here comes Wolly! This is awesome. You good? You sure this place is safe? Nice. Hey, Nova, take a quick picture of me and Ben. Don't take a picture, this is the secret spot man. This is a once in a lifetime moment. Say cheese motherfucker. This place looks familiar. Hey guys, I think this is where Lexington Steel shot his last film. The porn star? Yeah, he just won best male performer at the AVN awards. You didn't see it? I'm pretty sure. You got it, baby? Oh I got it, baby. Thank you. You look good from down here. Careful. I got it, I got it. Wow, that's great. Hey, I'm thinkin' burgers. I know this one, alright, listen, if you're on the FB, that's Facebook by the way, and, and don't give me this oh I only go on Facebook for business and blah, blah, blah... Who uses Facebook for business? I do, there's a lot of bitches on there, alright? Listen, you go on, you find me, you type in Happy Birthday Miles like the 178 other true friends who took the time out to acknowledge me and my busy schedule. Yeah, right. You mean to tell me that you actually notice more of the people that don't wish you happy birthday more than the ones that do? I keep a list. - He keeps a list. - I know you're laughing, but, it's, excuse me, are you on Facebook? And then what do they say after that? They always say something like... Ben, Ben? Hey, is it them? Maybe we should just get outta here. Alright. They might come around the block again. You sure it's makeup that makes those hands sparkle like that? Yeah, it's lotion. Your eyes too? You shine girl, it's not makeup. Oh, Jesus. It was the car's headlights, I thought it was them. I don't know why these fuckers won't just leave us alone. Clint thinks he owns me. Owns you? Why? Why do you wanna know? Because I wanna know about you. I wanna know you. I just want something different now, okay? Nova. What? That's him. Who? Is he looking at us? Yeah, that's him. That's the guy that gave me the jeans. Hey! Hey! Come on. Come on man, just wait up a second. Where did they come from? Why'd you give 'em to me? Where'd he go? I don't know. What is that? It's a bunch of jeans, a lotta jeans. Do you think they all make money? I don't know, but we're gonna find out. It's time, next. - You sure? - I'm sure. Listen, you better be sure, okay? I don't wanna mess this up. If these jeans are the right pair, you know that means I can't take these off, right? Yeah, I know that. That's what I've been trying to explain to you. Wait, wait, wait, wait, we didn't think about this. Maybe because you're wearing those pair of jeans, they cancel every other pair of jeans. Did you think about that, Ben? And maybe he just sells jeans on the street, you know. No magic. Why would he give us all of these jeans? It just doesn't make any sense. It's like, I don't know, like a puzzle or something. For life. These are the last two jeans, got this one, this one. Good, 'cause this is like doing Powerball 200 times in a row. Why don't we do something fun after this? Fun like what? We still have an hour to kill. I don't know like, I wanna go ice skating. Ice skating? Yeah, I've never been. Oh no, no, ice skating, black people and ice skating don't mix. What? Ice skating and black people don't mix? How many pro hockey players are black? I don't know. Exactly, thank you. No, it's a bad idea. It's like the time I tried skiing. What's wrong with skiing? Skiing's fun. No, are you listening to me? Skiing is a horrible idea, okay? They put your ass up in this little swing like 20 miles up into the atmosphere to carry you over a huge mountain like you're on the pits of a four-door. Don't laugh at me, this is serious, okay? They give you two sticks and they say, "Oh hey, we'll see you at the bottom." No, no, white people are crazy. That is a little crazy. Miles, you're not even black, man. Black enough, freakin... Wait, you're not black? Well, kind of. None of the other pants worked. There was only one miracle and it was mine. I can't believe you wanna play football. I've never played. Ready set. What're you doing man? She's gonna hike it. Turn your, jesus. Wait, I'll catch it, I'll catch it. ♫ The comforts of life Show me how to throw it, 'cause I remember... ♫ You are exceeding I got a bad feeling.

They're hanging out? Yeah, I'm on it. Gentlemen. Willie, Burt. '67. You have one unheard message. Yeah, I lied. Gopher. Just in case it slipped your memory, I know where you grew up and I bloody well know how to get there. Ben, are you okay? What're you doing out there? Our lives were at stake, and my dad's. We were up against a bonafide sociopath. Glitch was crazy enough to do anything. We needed to get it right, so we talked for hours. Laying our plans. We planned us and our lives together. We knew just what to do. I told her dreams of mine that I'd never told anyone, not even myself, and she told me hers. For the first time, we dared to think that we could have it all. It was real magic. It was the scariest and the best thing that I had ever done. But I still need to tell you my heart. Your little girl needs to know a life without protection, with a father who can see her for the woman that she is. Please know this man Ben is a good man. And he's had difficulties just like you. So when you meet him, give him a chance, and maybe your little girl can finally have her father's approval and not her boss's disdain. I ask you to follow my instructions and to be on time for once. , Nova. Dad, are you okay? Hey Goph, it's daddy here. You tried to weasel your way out of this, didn't you? You lied to me about the Genie. I don't know what you take me for, a bloody idiot? Alright, you got me, I lied. Now Goph, I got your dad here by the nuts, so you better get down here pronto. You'll get your cut as long as you don't hurt my folks. I'll give you an hour. Don't you try anything, you little prick, you hear me? Hello? Hey, we have a problem. Yes, I know. Don't worry about it, okay? I will take care of it. You continue with my father and we'll meet exactly where we planned, okay? Okay. My food. I need to go kitchen. My food is burning. I need to go to kitchen. Come on. Better taste good too. What's going on here? Where's Nova? What's he doing here? I have many clients, Ben, Clint happens to be one of them. Hey, I ask you a question. Glitch has got my father, he's trying to intercept him and bring him to the harbor. I have the money that he wants. And why should I trust you? She taught me that for you. Can you help us? Okay, let's go. Oi. Oi. Where do you think you're going? When you gotta go, you gotta go. Mate. Frank, take the old man here to the ladies, will ya? You should know, I plan to do a number two. She must really like you. I've never seen her like this before. And you? Do you truly like her? You truly like my daughter? You love Nova, you love her. I don't think she knows it, but she's my pride and joy. I remember this one time a deal had gone wrong. I was so angry at my client that I went back to my car and slammed the door. But I didn't know my little Nova sneaked in the car and put her little finger in the crack of the door. I went back and shot the motherfucker dead. Nelson. Frank! Alright, no funny shit. It's time to get to the bottom of this, so you fuckin' drive! So you say that you have $350,000 that Glitch wants to take from you? Yeah, that your daughter won. She's good with the cards, huh? She's amazing. I taught her. Look, Nova and I really need your help, okay? We did something and I'm not even sure, shit, that's the wrong car! Something's wrong man. And how do you know Glitch wants to take Nova's money? He's done being the middle man. He's tired of being number two, he wants your job. He needs the money to buy his way up. You're stupid, stupid! Fucking garbage, just like your father. Your father took things into his own hands, and now he's, and now he's dead. What did you say? He's dead Goph, dead! Nova. No! I'd put that down if I were you, Clint, if you care to see your daughter live. I will fuckin' kill you, man! "I will fuckin' kill you, man!" Sure you fuckin' will, Gopher! What do you want, mate? I want you to ask me not to kill your daughter. Who do you think raised her? She's ready to die. What is it about the money? Yeah, I want the fuckin' money. You want the fuckin' money?

Everything that happened, the magic, the danger, finding Nova, it was like a dream, but it was real. It was more real than anything had ever been. Life was a nightmare from which I had finally awakened. ♫ And set me free ♫ And I ♫ Don't live to regret ♫ I don't live to regret ♫ I don't live to regret I don't know why I deserved it, why the magic found me, but I knew I would do my best to deserve it, to deserve her, and I knew that we had to keep making our own magic and that the magic that had found me when I needed it, it wasn't mine to keep. Are you ready? Do it. So if the magic ever touches you, don't let it do to you what it did to me. Just give it away. But if you ever find the love that transforms you, if you ever find yourself living your dream, whatever you do, don't wake up. Come on fellas. Come on, you know things don't have to, don't have to be like this, huh? We could sort something out, yeah? I've got a hot deal going down, I can count you both in, 50/50, how's about that, huh? 50/50! Don't, hey, don't fuckin' leave me here! Hey! Fuck, at least, don't go away!
