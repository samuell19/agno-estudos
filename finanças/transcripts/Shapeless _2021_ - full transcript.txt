♪♪♪♪♪ [shower running] ♪♪♪♪♪ [jazz music plays] Hello, hello? Thank you for coming out this evening and enjoying your night with us. We are The Beatwood Pack. You know, the last one was one of my favorites, an oldie but a goodie. You gotta love the classics, right? [chuckles] Why don't we take a second to get to know my lovely band? We have all the usual suspects here. We got Charles on the drums. Hey Charles. [chuckles] Maggie on the keys. [tinkles piano keys] And this here's Oscar on the bass. - [woman whoops] - [laughs] And as always, I'm Ivy. [door opens] One, two, ah-one, two, three, four. [toilet flushing] [sighs] - [woman groans] Wow. - [man chuckles] - Bah-boo! - Thank you! You want to come to Frenchman with me? No, thanks. Long day. - First round's on me. - No thanks. You know long days turn into long nights, right? - [laughs] I'm good. - Okay. Lock up when you're done, yeah? I will. Have fun. - Okay. See you tomorrow. - Bye. - Miss Peterson. - Charles. - You. - [woman scoffs] - Tell Millie hi for me. - [Charles] Uh-huh. I'm going to Black Bayou. You wanna come? - No. - Come on. It's karaoke. No. We gotta hit the streets. [laughs] All right. See you soon. Good night. [Maggie] Charlie! Give me a ride. [Charles] No! Huh, we still got paid? [groans] It was a good set. "Gilded Cage" was awful. I liked it. It had character. Ending a song half as slow as you start isn't character. Hmm. It's a version of character. It's a version of talent, really.

You were severely dehydrated. The laryngoscopy results came back, and there are signs of severe damage to your esophagus and larynx. Here, let me show you. These are your vocal cords. Give me your arms. See how they are flush? That's what a healthy scan should show. Unlike yours. Now most of the time, this is caused by excess stomach acid corroding tissue. Do you suffer with acid reflux? Well, you know your body. But with continuing damage like this, you need to know that you risk rupturing your esophagus. Most of the scarring is likely irreversible, but vocal rest will stop the swelling. So no screaming along at concerts, no singing in the shower, and no yelling at your mom. [distorted] I'd say a month is a good place to start. [muffled] And then we can see where we're at. [very muffled] There are a lot of people... who have been in the exact same situation.
