- Okay, Jason's late. Jason's late. Nico, how old are you now? - Almost 25. - Right. So you know your mother met someone that she really loves. And I'm telling you, learn a lesson from me. Do not come between two people in love, don't do it. You can succeed in breaking people up, but it's bad. It's very bad. Don't even try. All right. Oh, Mrs. Clarke. Where's Jason? Nico, just make sure there's no crap on the carpet. John, how are we doing over here? Everything's ready to go. Where's Carl? - Yeah, where is Carl? I hope he's at an audition. Did you see Hamlet? - I, I did, yeah. - Look at that. - Yeah. Isn't he the most handsome man you've ever seen? He's very handsome. - Yeah, his looks do a lot of work for him, let me tell you. Anyway. If Jason fucks us over, I'm gonna fucking kill him. He's willing to work for $40 a day, so it was like, "All right, great." This is Nico's first day on any film shoot and we wanna get them turned on, okay? I'm not a good housekeeper. - Should I- - Just straighten it out a little bit. We don't want people looking at on-screen and paying attention to wrinkles on the bed, right, - we want them to look at Jason. - Okay. - You know, Andy moved into the Chelsea, right? He couldn't handle it, he just didn't fit in. He tried to have a fabulous party and bring all his little friends, and it just wasn't right. There's something phony there. - With Andy or the- - Yeah, with Andy Jonas can't stand him and Brakhage hates him too. The boys! Get, get John a cup of coffee, will you? - How do you like it? Black? Sugar. - All right. Plan C. We go home. - No, we'll do your story. Nico, have a seat. I'm the director. Or we could reschedule. No, no, no. - Rolling. - Okay, Nico, go. What do you love? - Um... I love, I love, um, when, when my family- - Get, get the door. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - Saul! How are yoU? - I, I should have remembered you have to go outside to get inside here. You can never get used to it, it's called cockamamie crazy maze craziness. Hello, sorry, is this guy okay? Oh, come on, we've done three films together. - Oh good. Okay, well then it's fine. - He did "Cool World," he did "The Connection." - Well, then I'm a big fan of yours. That's right. - I'm a big fan of hers. - This is Nico. - Hey. - You want some coffee? - Yeah, I'm fine, 'cause I know I'm running a little late. Okay. So, John, can you help him? - Oh, I see that you it to set up already. I got some stuff coming, it's, you know... The Porter will bring it up as soon as he's there. And maybe we can fill in back a little bit. It's just too shadowy. You know what I mean is I just don't like this look, you know, it's just like, it looks like some sort of cheap photography studio or something like that, you know? I want to fill it out. You know, if we're gonna have shadows, I want conscious shadows. - He's not there. He's not answering. - I want something with a blend and a tact to it, you know, some.. That's just like, that's cheap. I'm so glad we're finally working together, you know? I'm just from the Grand Concourse. You know what I mean? And you- - Yeah, but you worked at MGM! Come on! - But you come from different people. You are a princess. - Thank you, Saul. - You are an Academy Award winning princess. - Yeah, it's right over there. You ever seen a real Oscar before? Oh yeah. For a potato troll like me to be working for someone from your background- What kind of subject is this? I mean, I'm a little- - Well, you know- - I'm a little shocked that you're shooting in your living room. - Do you know I've been doing for the last few year? - Well, I mean, I've seen the Robert Frost film of course, you know, I love Robert Frost. - Oh okay. Just listen for a second. I wanna explain to you what we're doing here so that you understand. - Okay please, I'm, I'm listening. I'm listening. - Okay. First I thought, "Well, what's the most important issue going on in America?" It's the race issue. - Oh yeah. - My last two films have been about black people and this film is gonna be that too. - Oh, I see. Now I understand this. So I'm not going to change anything. I get what what you're going after. - Okay, you guys, can you just get set? Thanks, I've gotta call Carl. - Yeah, if it's gonna be like this I'll just leave it the way it is. - Nico. - Yes? - So is this your first shoot? - This is my first shoot. - Fantastic! Okay, you're going places. Go ahead and sit down there, we'll work a focus with you. You're gonna be a stand-in, okay? - Okay, have a seat. - Thank you. - You're cute, Nico. You're a good looking guy. The question is, are you going to be a nice guy? So Nico, what's your plan? Are, are we, are we working or are we just- - This is stupid. This is stupid. Yeah, I, I... - Let me call Carl again. - You know, you're in a privileged position. We'll figure it out. - Thank you. You want a Hydrox cookie? Like when were kids? I shouldn't be having cookies, actually. - What's that? - Black guys, black guys who's trying to pass for white? We call them one of these. - Hydrox cookie? Never fear. - Jason's here! Whoo! - Jason! Hun. - Hey, baby? - How are you? - Swinging pad you got here. - You forgot my stuff. - Who's this crazy cat? - This is Jason, our star. - Ooh, who's this crazy cat? That's some hot chicken you got cooking, baby! Pleased to meet you. Nico. Charmed, I'm sure. This is Saul, he's gonna be the DP. Saul, how're you doing? Nico, can you take his stuff? - Just got some props. Some some of my, some of my swinging stuff. That, you can take this, - thank you very much. - Okay, let's go. - Service with a smile. Come on, let's see that smile. - I can work with him if you want me to. - Okay, yeah, I want you to. - But I, I really- - I want you to work with him. - I don't believe that this is the right thing for you, miss. - That's okay. - You're a lady. You don't, you don't be in the same room with someone like this. - Jason is here! Gonna get my Gloria Swanson together. - This is a drug addict, whore, faggot. This nigger is like like 100% a degenerate. You don't want him. Are you gonna do this job or not? - I wanna work for you, but not this job. Shirley, what time do we start? Stay cool. - I know you. Yeah, I maybe cool- - Yeah, I know you and you know me, and we are all together. - No, no. I'm not together with you. - You can't make the scene then you ain't clean. - Oh, well, I'm clean, you're... You're the one. - Okay, Jason, I'm sorry. I want you to get out of here. - If you kick me out of here, I'm- - Where's John? - John, get him out. - I'm taking my equipment. - Whoo! - You know, I'm not gonna let you use this stuff. - Somebody needs a Valium. - Get out of here! - I have not made my point. - What's wrong with you? - And you fucking get out of my face! Nico looks a little, a little shaken. - Nico doesn't do- - It's all right, honey. - Let's go! - So, um, I don't know. Close the door. Thank you. Yeah, get Jason a drink. - Vodka tonic. Lesson number one: - John, do you think you can run the camera? - Always remember the order. - All right. That guy sucked! - I don't know. - That was a drag. Guess I'm gonna just make myself homely. - Yeah, okay. Well, we'll be ready in a minute. Thanks, John, okay. - Shirley, where's Carl? - Yeah, where's Carl. - You told me Carl was gonna be here. - It's nice to have you over. - And you turn it on over here. - Just- - You got a lot of stuff here, looks expensive. - Yeah, you see that horrible painting on the wall over there? My ex-boyfriend painted that. Your ex boyfriend? Yeah, I have an ex boyfriend who's a bad artist. - An ex boyfriend? And you're calling him a bad artist? Rolling, when I do I say those things? - Well, a fact's a fact. - You don't say anything. You just gotta keep an eye on the levels. - So Carly ain't coming? I don't know if I can even do this without Carl. Carl's my anchor. - Let's try. Let's try. Nico, get him another drink. - Get one bull yourself, Nico! Thank you, honey. Where's your drink? - You want some ice for your drink? - I'm fine. Straight up- - You're fine. - Straight Up Jason, they call come downtown. - Okay. - Just one second. - Okay. Could you do that fast, please? And then let's go. - One little thing that we gotta talk about. Why don't you sit down? - Okay, okay. - Sit down with Jason. There's a little question of money because I was talking to some people that I know in the business. Well, you know, these girl groups, how they get cut out of the rights to their own material, how does that work? - Well, they get royalties. I mean, you can get... - Give me some royalties. - Well, if you want royalties then you have to take less upfront, you know, that's how it works, right? You just write out a first draft of a contract and then we'll go from there. - So if you're gonna give me less, is there a way to get a little something upfront? - Sure. How much do you want? - Well, I was thinking for today, another $50. That would be a good price, I think. - Okay, I'll pay you at the end of the day. - That's cool. I trust you. - Okay. Okay, Jason. - How are you doing? You look a little nervous. - I'm okay. I'm ready go actually. I'm excited. - Okay. So- - Are you ready to go? - What if I say no? - That's it. That's the end. - Okay, I'm copping out. Where's my stuff? See what's worrying me is everything that happens in my life is all about other people's needs. I get drained. Now I'm approaching the age where it's almost over. We're gonna shoot this film. - Yeah. - You're going to tell us where you've been, who you are, you're gonna how people who you are. We're gonna show it all over the country, we're gonna show it all over the world, you will be known. - We wanna do something good, and something we're good at, and we wanna pick up a couple of nickels here and there. You know, when I look at you I don't really think of you as being white, I think of you as a friend, and more than that as a professional. I l- Hey, Shirley, what are you asking me? - Like, just think of it like an interview. Okay, so let's start- - Okay, I gotta warm up. - Yeah, let's do a warm up. - You know I got this nightclub act going, right? Cameras roll. - Ooh Lord! My mother always told me, one person's trash is another person treasure- - Jason- - Keep something for seven years- - Jason by Shirley Clarke, take one. - You'll find some use for it. Problem with unemployment is as soon as you wake up, you're on the job! Don't feel like you have to put on a show. You know, just be yourself. - Boom! - Just like an interview. - Ooh wee! Why do Jewish divorces cost so much? Because they're worth it! Nico, why don't you light the cigarette before you sit on my face? - Light his cigarette. It's show time! You're giving the audience what they want. - What they think they want. Cap your hands! Every, come on, clap your hands! Oh, shit! Cut! - Honey, I've told you to get yourself a drink. What'd you say your name is, Nico? Nico. - Yeah, just it's hot in here. You got all these lights here, it's- - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Come on, come on, just, just relax. Here, here, why don't you light it with your dick, huh? Fuck! Nico, here. - I want everybody to be loose now. - Well, what would be helpful to you? - Let's smoke a joint. - All right, let's smoke a joint. Help yourself. You know, I got married. You know, my my real name isn't Clarke. Did you know that? Mm, what's your real name? - Brimberg. - That's a Jewish names. - That's right. And you know, I grew up on Park Avenue. - Whoo! Park Avenue? - My father was an industrialist. - So it ain't total ho-ing on your part. - No, not at all. - Did you love your husband? No. - Did you like him? - Nico, can you get a match? - That's why you can have nice things in this house. You bring a nigger in and the whole place gets nigger-fied. Hey, kid. How am I gonna doing some crazy scene in the Chelsea Hotel with some white lady chick who's living here, who come from Park Avenue, who ain't on Park Avenue, who got her motherfucking Oscar, but she don't see to wanna play the game. - I don't need to. - You lucky bitch. - That's right. Well- - An accident of birth. - And we're gonna make a film together. I can't make it without you, you can't make it without me. Because- - All right, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta get, get off my feet here. Yeah, have a seat, honey. All right. - [Shirley And we'll get you a drink and then we're gonna start. So this is your time to tell your story about what it's like to be you, what you've lived, what you know. - This is living! This is my life. All right, well, here, take your drink. - Vodka, straight. - Thanks, baby. Where's your drink? Nico, get on the sound. Get on the sound and then get on this. Jason by Shirley Clarke, take four. Free love? That's the only love I can afford! - Okay, we're rolling. So tell us your name. - You want me to do this for the the camera? Where's your camera? - Right here. - My name is Jason Holliday. So Jason, what do you do for a living? - I'm a stone whore, a prostitute, a hooker! Darling, I have balled from Maine to Minnesota, from Minnesota to Mississippi, and balling every step of the way all the way back. Isn't it lonely having sex with strangers? - Having sex is never lonely, honey. Having sex is the opposite of loneliness. I'm tri-sexual. I'll try anything once! I'm a seller, not a buyer. I'm a whore and I'm not ashamed of it. - Jason, tell me about your old man. - I can't do that. Why didn't you do a movie about you? Every movie I make is about me. - Sho'nuff, honey! Roll out. - Change nags. Nico, follow me. - $50? You gotta give me 75! You're killing me! - I'm going to pay you. I have it. - I wanna know what is about this movie that's gonna help my show. You telling me it's a publicity angle, but you saying that you don't care whether it wins Academy Award or not. - You know what, I have an idea. Let's change the whole concept. - Okay. - Let's make it all be about your show. I'll interview you about your influences, the people you've met, your background, how you came to be a singer. You'll describes your show, you'll give them a little taste, and then they'll want more. - You know what? - What? - Change of heart. Okay, so we'll do it that way. We'll talk about your work. John, let's go! Um, I've got to switch audiotapes. Okay. Where's Nico? Nico, keep rolling sound no matter what happens, I wanna get everything. Rolling. Jason by Shirley Clarke, take five. - What's a Jewish pedophile pick-up line? Wanna buy some candy? I don't see you laughing, Shirley. - I'm laughing. I'm laughing. Just like, I'm laughing. Okay. So what was your father like? - Hmm. Hold on, you told me that this film is about me! - No. - Is this camera rolling? - All the cameras are rolling. - Yeah, All the cameras are rolling. - All right. 'Cause it sounds to me like you want to come with some motherfucking chitlin bit! I'm just so itchy. You know what it's like to have that Carl Jones. I think you and me have been there, right? - When Carl comes he can save the day. Take six. - Tell me about your dream show. - I see blue. New York's finest nightclubs. Only the best people. Blue lights. Blue smoke. Hot musicians, dancing girls, and I'll sing and tell jokes, and be a fabulous star! I'll sing blues and jazz, and all the classics Tiny little blue angles, what do they call them? Putti? Hanging from the sky. I'll be a star! I'll be a star! - So Jason, what's the date for this cabaret act? What's the date? - Booking comes late. I mean, when are you gonna really do it? - Well, that's the thing, Shirley, I have the talent, but the money, Shirley, it's all about the money. - I've seen you burn through huge amounts of money. - I ain't saying that I didn't blow a lot of cash. - Anyone who says that they need money to make art isn't telling the truth. Art is about the relationship, it's about having a relationship with other people where you tell the truth to each other, and you change each other, and then you produce something that will change other people, that's what it's about. Money is just an excuse for you, Jason. That must feel very strange, like everyone's running and you're standing still. - What? - I mean, look at Carl. Carl just played Hamlet. Darling, it must have been wonderful. Did he get all the words right? - He doesn't let anything stop him. And you, you let everything stop you. Why? What's it like to be lying all the time? What's it like to be telling people that you're gonna do this and you're gonna do that, and you're not gonna do any of it? You hit the nail on the head. The reason black people are in pain is because they won't take aspirin from the bottle, it involves cotton picking. - All right, cut! - Jason by Shirley Clarke, take seven. - Hey, baby. You're a lot like these white ladies I work for. What are they like? - They take control the whole galaxy when the old man ain't around, except for the ones that are able to put the old man away one way or the other. But yeah, it's a lot of control. What do you do for them? - Pretty much whatever they want. But a lot of times I have to guess what it is because most times they don't know what it is they want. So I fry a little chicken, I scramble a few eggs, but most of all I just make them feel like they're wanted. I give them, if not love, something is close to as they never have. And, yeah, I walk their dogs, pet their cats, water the plants, whatever, cook their greens, do their shopping, the whole nine yards. Do you like working for them? - Do I like working? When it's work, you can guarantee I don't like it. So this is the trick of all tricks: You make what you do what you like, and then you make what you like what you do, and when they come together it's all groovy. And when it ain't groovy, that's the time that you start moving on to something else. - And that's what I do. - Jason- - There's these rich white ladies- - Jason- - That I'm just like waiting hand and foot on- Jason. Giving them whatever it is they want- - Oh, Jason- - Vacuum their floor, which is better than sweeping. Jason. And they just say in my head. Jason! Just think about how this feels. - Oh, it feels so wonderful. Just think about the feeling. - You know, I never much cared for niggers. Jason, now, you've gone too far! Once is quite enough. So you think one nigger feel is the same as another nigger feel? - I don't know anything about how a nigger feels. Your services are not needed! - So you say. But you didn't say that last week when I had these fingers up in your pussy. - Jason, don't you know how I feel about you? - When I look at you, I see a phony, aging, white spoiled bitch that has nothing to rely on but her money, her so-called breeding and her reputation. Well, you know, I didn't mean it all that way. What makes you feel good? - Well, that you have a wonderful smile and a terrific laugh. Oh! - Oh, Jason, I'm not here to play games with you! - Bend your knees like this. - Throw your leg up! - Whoo! There you go! - There you go! - Whoo! Oh, oh, honey, it's all right. It will be fine. Like this? You like it? And how many times did you have to do that, Jason? I'm doing it now with you. Cut! - I'm getting a little lost in my realities here. Nico, can you take everyone's lunch order? Call the deli. - Which one? - Ben's Deli down the street. Corned beef, pastrami, whatever people want. Just get a piece of paper and ask everyone what they want. - Sandwiches and stuff? - Yeah, thanks. - This is pure joy. 'Cause in this scene, Nico's the nigger. So where that deli, boy? Deli boy, I'm getting fed up. Mrs. Clarke, is everything okay? - Nico, you're gonna to be a director some day so learn from me. Jason is doing everything that we want him to do, but don't let him know. Got it? And you're doing good too. - Okay. - Shirley, where's Carl? - Where is Carl? He works, you know? He works it. And you know that as well I, 'cause Carl's gonna do something for you, Carl does something for me. - Have you ever seen Carl show up on time? I have not. Okay. - Honey, Carl is supposed to be a motherfucking professional! He is I thought, I thought y'all were gonna teach me. As far as fucks as I can see, you would be a mess as I am. - When he was a star, he was there on time. - You saying Carl ain't no star? - No, when he did "Cool World." - You said when he was. When he was the star of the film. You wanna just hand out everyone's sandwiches? Okay, everybody, half hour. - Carl's my engine. - Jason, Jason, let's go for a walk. - Carl's my engine. Croatian John? - What? I'm now supposed to go for walk like a fucking dog? Let's go up on the roof, it's beautiful. You've been on the roof of the Chelsea. Come on, get your coat, let's go. We're climbing Jacob's ladder. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Nice, right? You come up here all the time? - Every day, every morning. - Hmm, so this is how the other half live? - It's not the half. Jason, how do you think the movie's going? - Like it means something to me? Like I'm going to know? How is the movie's going? - Well- - You tell me, how is the movie going? - All right, let me tell you. I've shot five hours of you. I have enough to make a feature film. Is that how you wanna be seen? I think you should listen to what I'm saying. - Honey, I'm listening. - I have five hours of you. - I'm listening. I'm carrying this lunch bag and I'm listening. Okay. - And I told you I'm hungry. Is what you want the world to see of you already in that camera? - Oh, it's a pride issue. - No, it's about truth. You want me to tell you something about truth? You want the story from Jason's side? - No, don't want a story. You wanna hear the story from Jason's voice? - No! I don't wanna hear a story. I want you to listen to me. Is that how you wanna be shown to the world? What you've given so far, is that who you want to be? - What am I trying to say? What am I trying to say? - You need to think about what you want the world to see and you need to give that to me, because otherwise what you've done so far is what's gonna stand in for you. - Okay, okay. - You know what? You're not listening. It's not about me. I've got the footage. It's about you. - My world. is the jazz world. Night after night, swinging and listening to the be-bop. To the To the I'm talking you smoking, I'm talking drinking, I'm talking hanging out. I mean, look at this world. Come with me. Come on. They say it's a whole new world. And me digging on this beautiful scene- - Okay, well, you think it over. - It's just like I just wanna be here. I just wanna be here in your world just for a minute. Why can't you see the beauty here? I mean- - Okay, so this is what I wanna talk to you about: how you became an artist. Take 15. - I wanna do that again, keep rolling. Take 17. - It's working for me. Take 18. - You are trying to open me up like a Maryland crab. You ever eat Maryland crabs? No. - It's a messy business. Take 19. Okay. Hmm. - Jason, I wanna move you around a little bit. Okay. - Can you stand up, you know? Do you need something? - Jason by Shirley Clarke, take 20. - Colored people have nothing. And when I say people, I mean power to the people! Whoo, Jason, you are a fool's fool. - It's okay, just keep rolling. - Take 21. - Jason by Shirley Clark, take 22. - Can you tell that cop story? So how did you feel when they locked you up? - What the fuck do you mean how do I feel? How would you feel being locked up like an animal for not much reason except for being what and who you are? - No, I can't. - Let me tell you, it's like this: Have you ever had somebody you love - turn their back on? - Yes. - Have you ever had somebody who don't love - turn the back on you? - Yes. - So how does that feel? - I know that when you were locked up you got very upset, tell us about that... What happened with your glasses? Let's do that again. Take 23. So Jason, tell me about your old man. - Mm. So I was brought up by my momma and my sisters. I was the baby princess, they would put pajama top on my head and the pajama tops, they'd make a little braid, and they would worship me that the little princess. My old man, they called Tough. And they did not call Tough tough for no reason. Tough had muscles out to here. Well, how did he feel about you? - I think he loved me. He loves babies. Except you gotta understand with colored people, a man's world is a woman's world pretending that it's a man's world. Once you get to a certain age, say the time that you can talk, Tough's over you. Tough was beautiful man. I remember it even from the time I was young, and Tough is standing there and he's like shaving, and I'm down here at the floor, just to Tough's knees practically, and what do I see? This gorgeous long thing just hanging down. And of course, I'm only coming up to here, and Tough's like standing up, towering over me, not paying no attention to me at all. To me, everything is a toy. And I turn around and I look and I see, "Ooh, that's a pretty toy," and reached out for it. And bam! Bam! So that's Tough. Man can't have a little faggot boy running around so he's got to do something about it. Takes me by the scruff of the neck like I'm a cat. And that was that. How did you feel? - I didn't care. I was just a baby, it didn't mean nothing to me. Okay, cut. - What did the Trenton county sheriff call the nigger that got shot 14 times? The worst case of suicide he ever did see. - Okay, cut. I think we have 20 good minutes. - Mm. - Okay, so we need 90. - Mm. - Okay, so don't waste any more time. - Okay. - Just go for it. - Okay. - And the faster you go forward and the truer it is, the sooner we'll be out of here. - Okay. - Okay? - All right. - Great. - Take 27. - Hey! So who's your first white boy? - I count two as my first. There's the first that's physical, and then there's the first that's coming from the heart. Where is he, your white boy? - Running around doing his thing, I guess. Yeah. Chickens come home to roost. I miss him, I really do. So what do you like about white men? - What I like most about white men is when you get into them, you really get into them. And I'm talking about the rectum that's like a sweet, soft peach. Take 24. - I want some sparkle plenty's. Have you got any sparkle plenty's? You know, you get the chemistry going. - John, you have any sparkle plenty's? - John? I do not. - You know I know this cat. How do you know John? - Well, it's not my job to tell what shouldn't be told. First time I met this cat, this cat wanted to know if I was a transsexual. Why? What were you wearing? - I'll show you. - Do you know him? No, do not. - Okay. - I miss him. I really do. It's like a sweet soft peach. Oh, fuck! Oh, where have you been Billy-Boy, Billy-Boy. - Hi, Jason. - Hey, come and sit over here. Sit down with me. - I can hear your pipes leaking. - Honey, you look so good. It's called the Frug, you ever seen it? The Twist will never go out of style. There's a little hardness in you, boy. I'm not the same boy before, Jason. - I'm not the same Jason you met, boy. - Yes, you are. You're still working on the same songs, still doing the same shows. - And so what are you now? - I'm free. - Free? - Free. - Tell me freedom. - Have you ever seen a sunset on top of a mountain? I've been to Brazil. I've been to Africa. I've been to London. I've been to Taiwan. - How are you gonna be doing all that traveling? Is your mommy still paying your way? - No. - Lucky white boy. No? Oh, I see. So you have learned a trick or two from Jason. - I borrow. - Mm-hmm. And you pay back, I'm sure. So now little Billy-Boy is all grown up. - All grown up. - And he's gonna show Jason what it's like to live the of a grown white man, huh? - Or should I live the life of a grown black man? What should I do? Just be real. stay in your groove, dig what you're digging. And give Uncle Jason a kiss. You want more? There's more left. Let me get an ashtray before we burn this place down. You don't know me, Jason. - I want you because you were the only who ever wanted me for what and who I am without feeling that it was something you had to make excuses for, explain about, or otherwise completely deny. - Wow, that's really beautiful. - Yeah, honey, you have changed. You look tired. - Why don't you come to bed? - I don't, I don't feel tired. - Come one! - Jason! - You got me into this. - Jason! - Why are you backing off? - Get off me, Jason! Jason! Get off, Jason! Just relax. - Stop, Jason, please! White boy! Is that all you fucking see? Fuck you! Get off me! - This is not even my place. - Shut up! - I was gonna ask you to stay here. I want you to be happy. I don't want, I don't want you to fight, you know? - Come on. - I'm not gonna sing it with you. Jason. I'm just gonna have Alka-Seltzer if he wants some Alka-Seltzer. I don't think he wants any Alka-Seltzer. - Hello, darling. I wanna ask you something but I want you to promise me that you'll answer it before I ask. - My advice to you is to ask and see what happens. - Alright. I'll do it your way. - Here's my last question for now. Tell us about when you were raped. - Mm, that might require a little cleansing ritual. This is when colored folks bring in the Indian in them 'cause you know all colored folks got Indian blood, right? Or so we say. Feeling clean? - Uh-huh. - Okay. - Tell us about when you were raped. Do you call it rape? - Let me ask you, what was it like on your wedding night? Did you call that rape? - I call that boring. What do you want, Jason? - I want Carl. What else do you want? - I want to be free. Tell me what I need to do to be free. Is this gonna be another Oscar? You never know, but I don't think so. - So what about the Candy Man? What about him? - Is he coming? - That's why you wanna see Carl? You want dope. That's so banal. Why didn't you just tell me three hours ago? I'm just gonna make a phone call. Jason, you're living in the past. Everybody can get dope not just black guys. He lives just down the hall. - Hey sweetheart, it's Shirley. - It's crazy. Hey, Miss Lady, you need something? - Yeah, come on over, you know. Yeah, I can make the scene, baby, all right. - Yeah. - All right. - Yeah, just come over. You don't need Carl for that. - Now that I know the Candy Man is coming, my energy has re-spiked. You've been wasting all my time over this crap? - You gotta have fuel to make the fool- - You're living in the past, baby. - Act. - You're living in the past. He'll be right here. - Excellent. - Go ahead, Nico, have a drink. - Okay. - It's about time. - You know, it's almost Hanukkah? - I would hardly know when Christmas is coming except for the sales. Well you and I have that in common. - And I don't even buy anything. All right then, you probably shoplifted, right? There you go. - More than one time. - Okay. All right, just relax. - You want anything? - Hmm? - You want anything? - Mm-mm. I did underestimate you. You did? What a surprise! Do you think that happens to me every single day fucking day of my life? Yes. - I know it happens to you every day of your life, but what I wanna know is what happens to you when the table turns, when you become the subject of interrogation. - I'm a, I'm the director, so that's not gonna happen. There's enough movies about women, there's not enough movies by women. - My experience is very quickly becoming everybody's experience. They just don't call it the same thing. It's the nigger story. You think I'm joking when I say everybody' a nigger. Do you think everybody's a Jew? - No, I don't. I don't think that. I don't. - So, not everybody's a nigger, and not everybody's a Jew, but everybody could be a Jew. - Hey, baby. - Hey, Miss Lady. - How are you? Hi! - Hmm, mwah! - Come on in. - Mwah! - You know, Jason? - Hey. - What's happening, baby? How you doing? - What you look good? - What's up? - All right, all right, good. Good, good. Y'all making a TV show? - Yeah. - We're waiting for you. - Shit! - We're making a movie about Jason. - A movie? - You know I made movies. - You're Harry Belafonte. Shit! That's lovely. That's absolutely lovely. You know, I just got into Los Angeles. Ow. What were you doing? - Brother named Oscar levant had a TV show. This is just after Marilyn Monroe turned Jewish, right? Yeah. - Everybody turning Jewish. Shit! Marilyn Monroe is kosher, that mean Arthur Miller can eat her. Without milk. - Well, he don't need it. She kosher, she cleans. That's some clean people them kosher people. That motherfucker ain't on, right? - No, don't worry about the camera. It's not on. - No? - No. No. - What's this nigger doing staring in the thing? He's learning how to use the camera. - But it ain't on though, right? No, he's learning how to use it when we're off on break, he's a student. - Oh, you a student. Can you get this guy a drink? - Yes, uh, what do you want? - Courvoisier. We have Jack Daniels, we have some- - Hell, yeah! Yeah! - Okay, okay. So how do you like our house boy? What you talking about? - No, seriously, when I saw you walk in the door, - What? - I thought you were Muslim, black Muslim. - Yeah. - Like a Malcolm X. - They're all right. They good people. - But you ain't one of them? - Why you gotta know so much about me? - I'm just asking questions. - All right now. - Yeah. - All right now. What's this motherfucker doing? That's Nico. You know that we're making a movie about Jason. I'm a movie star. It's all about Jason. - It's all about Jason. - All about Jason. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Come here brother, let me rap to you. Okay, let's see what you got. Master of the ball. - Look, look, look, look, here. How much, how much are they you paying you to do this shit? Enough. It's a residual, a residual arrangement. - What the fuck is that? - More money the movie makes, the more money the player takes. - Well, how much money they're going to make? It could be anything. - How much are you making today? How much you got right now? - Today I already made $500. - Show me some $500, nigger! - This is- - You got $500, I give you everything I got. What you got? - I can't even tell you that because I don't handle my own cash. That's where it's at. - Well, I saw the green in her hand, I didn't see it in your hand. - I'm gonna give you a little bit of this because that's what's going to work for you, baby. 'Cause Carl said that you a stone cold, cold babe. That's what you're looking for, right? - I'm tempted. - I know you are, baby. So I've come here to touch you up. - Can we sniff it? - No. Sniff? Shit! This go right up inside you, baby. All the way up inside you and make you feel good. - Oh, it's tempting. - It's paid for. It's yours. You know what- - Here, taste that. - It's real. It's good. - People like you and me, we get said no to all the time. Let me be the one to tell you yes, all right? You got your own shit? You wanna use my shit? You act like this is the first time you've ever done this. It's right here. When was the last time somebody paid for your shit? - Okay. How about this one? - Oh, you like the white hose. - It's pink. It's prettier. You wanna do it? - No. - No. - Come on, man. - No. Look, there are so many things going on in my mind. Do I want it? - Yes, I want it. - Yeah. - 'Cause I need thins. - That's right, baby. You go back in there and make your movie. Oh, no, no, come here, baby. Come here, come here, come here. What you need, you need something inside you, right? I don't usually do this for nobody, but I'ma do it for you. Pull your shirt, baby. Pull your shirt. Look at that right there. - See it? - There you go, baby. - See it? - That's all for you. - Mm-hmm. I got good veins. - You got it good, baby. - Mm-hmm. That's gonna make. That's why they love me. Who love you, baby? - Honey, I thought I was getting a sparkle plenty, but after- - You gonna shine, baby. You gonna shine. - Oh, yeah. - This is gonna put you all way there. - Mm-hmm. - All the way there. Who love you? - Oh, Miss Lady. He's good and fucked up, right? All right, you're a doll. - Look here, I'll drop you now, but I'll catch you later. - Jason. I only last a moment then I'm gone, that's me. Vacation home for wayward boys. So do we have a movie? - I think we have a movie. Jason, I want you to use the mantle. Nico. Let's go. Chair or drink? - Both. - Chair and drink. - You are a fucking faggot! - Use the mantle. - Sure enough, honey. This is it. - I never much cared for niggers. Rolling Tell us the story about the cop. - Momma? Momma, whoo! Is this making you fell good? Is this entertaining them? Momma? - What did I do? What did I say to make you be this way? Don't turn your back on me like you're Miles, Momma. Keep the energy moving. How does a junkie dance? A junkie dance like this. I want you to go, Momma. No matter what you do, no matter what star you think you are, you're still my child. I love you, baby. So tell us the story about the cop. - Once upon a time... An the cop with blond hair and blue eyes, just like I said. You know about my white boy fever? Jason is a lazy cat. Let's pretend that didn't happen. Tell us about the time you were raped at Riker's Island. - You're asking me questions without any real meaning. Why did you break your glasses and slit your wrists at Riker's? - Is this it? Is this the moment? This is where Jason's supposed to break? Is this where Jason the puppet starts to dance and do whatever the director tells him to do? Is with the director wants? Is this what we're here for? Jason, you wouldn't have broken your glasses if you thought you were gonna live. - The voice in my head that's driving me crazy because you're fucking with me, and I know you're with fucking my nerves, and you're fucking with my endurance, fucking with my consciousness- - Sorry- - And you're fucking with my peace of mind. - Tell them what the system did to you. - You're fucking, fucking me up! - You broke your own glasses and slit your wrists! - You're fucking me up! - And you wanted to die. - You are fucking me up! - Because the system fucked you over. - What's the motherfucking system? You want a system? What do you got? You got a schedule, you got your fucking boom mics, or whatever the fuck you call them. You got this- - You were entrapped, you were humiliated. - Camera! - You were put in prison. - And you're trying to get something out of me. - You were raped. - No, I was raped? You was raped. - Okay, we now know, now we know the truth. - I'm a nigger. You're a nigger, He's a nigger. She's a nigger. We's a nigger. They's a nigger. Now we know the truth, and you know what the truth is? You won't tell the truth. - You wanna hear the truth? I'm a great big star, but they will not admit it. And this is where the scene changes into a more classic Hollywood scene where she says, "You know how to whistle. You just pucker up your lips and blow." Roll out. - Okay, everyone, take five. - Shirley! Shirley! My point is why aren't the cameras rolling all the time? This a very, very, very difficult point between what the Kuchar brothers call... No, actually, not even the Kuchar brothers. It was, um,. It was the moment of. It's like theater with the priorities reversed, that's a quote. So if the cameras are not rolling, you're not- - Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad you. You gonna give your man some sugar? - Okay. - Some real sugar? - Okay. - Yeah? A little bit? Yeah? - Okay. - Thank you. - He's playing the fool but he's acting. I need you to make it real. I need your help. I've been shooting him for 10 hours. - Where are you trying to get? - I want you to break him. - You want me to break him? - I want you to break him. Jason's my friend. - I need you to break him. Come on, you take the director's chair. - All right. - Hey, Jason! John! - Jason. Damn, boy, you high as a Georgia pine! - 'Tis a far, far better world I go now than I have ever gone before. - To be or not to be? - That is rarely the question. Oh yes, my man! - You know the truth, I know the truth. - Carl. - You're my brother. - You ar ere my lover. Say it the right way. I am your brother. - You are my lover! - She wants the same thing all them ofays want. - Did that. Did that. Did that. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No you did around that.

Apparently not enough. Apparently not enough. You must fix this. - It's been a marathon, Carl. I need you to wake up! Kate May. - Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean, I would love to love your work, I don't. But at least you got the looks going for you, a little bit. You're going around everything. Get to the heart. What are you afraid of? - Carl, what's real? Teach me, Carl, what's real? - What are you afraid of? That's what I'm asking you. - You know I ain't afraid. - Well then cut to it. Give me some real shit. Give me something real. For once in your life, don't be anything other than who you are. Do you know who you are? Sit down. Do you know what you are? - Nigger, please! Fuck that shit. This is Jason, faggot Jason that sucked your black cock! Carl! That could be any number of Jasons. You think you're the only one? - You're just like the rest of them! You want me to tap dance?

You and me. - You and me. - No, no, no, no. - Too much. - It wouldn't be the first time, would it? - Okay, okay. - Oh, Carl. - Watch your head, watch your head. - Carl. Carl. - Yeah. - Please.

And in some other form of reality, there was something, some sense of another me. - Jason by Shirley Clark, take 50. - You like to sit back and tell your stories, and great- - That's my material, man. Love it. - People love my jokes. - Yeah, absolutely. - People love my- - Life of the party.

Look in the abyss, my friend, look into the abyss, 'cause that's all there is. - So did you get the shot? - Darling, we're running out of room at my apartment. Do you mind if we all come over here with the skylight and the prettiness? Come on, Shirl, you're gonna love it when they're all here. - I'm sorry darling. - Of course. Look at, they're all having fun. - Hey. - Hello. - Good to see you. - How are you? Dance.
