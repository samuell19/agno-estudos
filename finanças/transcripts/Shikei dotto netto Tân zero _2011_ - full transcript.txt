Does everyone here have someone they want to kill? Well then, let's work together to do the killing I finally got a hald of you No real reason faor calling What are you doing? Oh, I see Just hear me out a sec Spare me the whining I thought of something I got this song stuck in my head It's a famous song “That the World May Change Nana, I'm sorry I made you wait But there will be no more victims like you anymore Hey. Nana I'm sure Mio will use DeathPenalty com I'm sure Mio will make that fucker a target The system will be perfect once that fucker is killed So “That the World may Change Mio, I'm going to start now Good job Success. We beat the target to death and buried her. Let's go on to the next turn Amazing! Well, that's the gist of it, right? We did it “We did it?" He tried to bury me for real! It's not as fun ifwe don't make it seem real Hey. Mio. You skinned your elbow Yankee King! I'll make you the next target! I'm sorry (Mio) Won't they come in contact when handing over the weapon? -(Yankee King) Yeah, so? Wouldn't that be bad? (Yacho) I think it'd be fun to have to plan out the drop-off the weapon? You have to think for this game (Ruruko) We can't check that the Destroyer of Evidence did their job (Moemon) We can say they failed if word of the murder gets out What should we do in that case? (Star) What? No. I don't know (M) That person should take responsibility by getting killed What the hell? It's a murder exchange game in which you follow this guy called GOD A “client” is chosen one by one The other 3 players kill the client's choice of “target.” We've all come to this lodge to do a part-time job as debuggers, trying out this game that's in-development and looking for the bugs The part time job is fun. But -Where are you from, Mio? -Tokyo I go to Akihabara every week So you're a geek? Is this sort of job common? I've done this kind of job a few times But this is my first time being put up in a lodge Debugger jobs usually aren't this nice “Debugger? You look for bugs in games Whatever All T know is I'm getting paid 1 million yen! What? -It's 100,000 yen, for two days work -Me too Is that true? Of course! How can we get 1,000.000 yen? Just think about it Fuck! I quit my job at the convenience store yesterday. I gotta call them back I can't get a signal You're 50 stupid. Yankee King I'm not stupid. And my name's not Yankee King. it's Yoshida Mr. Yoshida? But it is fun to call each other by our user names from the game, no? What you are looking at? It's the website of erotic blog idol Moemi-tan! Well You don't know her, do you? No. I got an offer to design a website I'm thinking of modeling the site after this one I see I see Ilike her! She's really cute Her blog is really erotic, too But she hides her face I can still tell she's cute Even if she just uploads pics of just her eyes and other parts I heard rumors she's a slut who uses and dumps virgins but that's an abhsolute lie! Really? -But I'm not into stuff like this -0Oh, I see I got the charcoal ready. -Wow. thanks so much, M! -Yeah, let's eat! Come help! Thanks for getting it ready so quickly Come on, put more strength into it! Harder, harder’ Keep going, don't give up! -This is mine -lwant to eat some eggplant! -This one's done -That one's mine! Hey. M Hey. M Is the "M" short for “light masochism” or “extreme masochism? -That's sexual harassment! -I'l leave that to your imagination We can tell Moemon's a hardcore masochist, so this conversation's over. Maybe it's good I took on this job! The game's quite fun! I thought we'd have to play something boring But it's a bit in bad taste. The murder But that's what makes it fun! Huh. what? Nothing I 'don't have a girlfriend now. You wanna fuck? Do you know "Shining Farm?” I made that game Yeah, I know that game Really? What a coincidence! I did the debugging for that game! You must know Kotani in Graphics Uh. yeah... He's a real gentleman Um, Kotani is a woman Then, do you know Suzuki in Planning? Umm, yeah I see Get out of my way! -Sorry -Yacho-chan, it's too early! -Hey, do we have any more beer? -l need another, too Do we have any onions left? I don't like this kind of atmosphere I'm shy around strangers That's not very manly I'm not much of a people person I didn't think I had to be to do this debugging job That's not manly Let's have fun and talk to everyone What are you guys doing? Get over here! It's especially guys like that What can I say, I'm just afraid of them Let's go. Let's talk to everybody I heard a bunch of high school kids killed themselves arcund here They killed themselves around here Let's join them.

What's wrong? What . the fuck'? What is this?? Is that a knife in your hand? No. it wasn't me! Is he really dead? -Go take a look. Moemon -No. I don't want to! I said lock at him! Hey. Nana Those are the targets of DeathPenalty com There are reasons for killing them Well then, let's start the experiment Hey, Mio What are you going to do? This ain't a joke! Seriously! But it really was you, wasn't it? What? How many times must I tell you! When I came into his room he was already like that! You were the Killer for the heta test, but you killed for reall No way! That's retarded! -You and M had a relationship? -Yeah, didn't you two do it last night? Don't say weird stuff! In this kind of situation the criminal is usually still here That whodunit cliché doesn't happen in real life! You don't know that! What the fuck Who are these people? Good morning. debuggers It's DeathPenalty. com, isn't it? -Are these other debuggers? -But why are they on the screen? The peaple beside me are called No s 1 through 4 Each has someone they want to kill Let's work together to do the killing This isn't funny Hey. where are you guys”? We don't have time for these games! You hear me!? We are starting a murder exchange No.'s 1 through 4 will go in order as our clients The other three kill the target, the person the client wants killed thereby giving the client an alibi Yes, an alibi What were you guys doing last night? I was with Yacho all night long What? You're kidding, right? I was alone, reading -Any proof? -l don't have any I was surfing online Moemi-tan's blog hasn't been updated That's not evidence! You look the most suspicious! The person with an alibi for the whole night is more suspicious! The four of you will rotate among the roles of Preparer of Weapons Killer, and Destroyer of Evidence Now that we've gone over the rules, let's start DeathPenalty com First, No. 1, who are we judging? It's a convenience store clerk He's rude, flirty, and annoying He should die That stupid punk thinks he's so cool I see Sounds like a real punk Is he strong? What are you all staring at? Strangle him and dump the body in a swamp So the weapon will be a rope The body will sink into the swamp by itself. right? OK, let's assign roles No. 2, you're Preparer of Weapons No. 3, you're the Killer And No. 4, you're Destroyer of Evidence I'l send that bad boy's location to No. 3 The Word of GOD is absolute You will face a penalty if you fail to carry out your duties Who's fucking with me? -Is it you? -What?

We understand We're at Sunset Lodge in Hayano Town The police want all of us to stay here for questioning We're all suspects! Nana Nana, I've been on the bottle every since you died But no matter how much I drink, I can't get that song of yours out of my head Hey wait, Yankee King! Yankee King, you can't just leave! Shut up! I didn't kill anyone. so it's OK But... we're supposed to wait here! You guys can tell the police all they need to know Why should I have to bother with that bullshit! Anyway, the job's over, right? Why should I waste my time with you? I mean How can you stay here knowing a killer's on the loose? Who are you? Who the fuck are you? We'll be OK. It's the person who left that's in trouble It's going ta be a pain getting asked more questions by the police Success. We strangled the punk and dumped him in the swamp Next turn is No. 2's Please designate your target I was betrayed by this blog idol Blogs are just full of lies She tricks guys with her act She's too old to play goody-two-shoes I lost my virginity to her You fucked her? Was it good? She's scarred you for life That's a serious offense This website's still running? How creepy! lwant you to smash her face in with a hammer!

Then who's I'm not going to panic Hasn't it been 3 hours since we called the police? When are they going to get here!? -Should I call again? - should be heading home! That's how Yankee King got killed! I'm sorry' Hey. I'm sorry about how I acted earlier So you really are a fan of mine? Huh? I guess I can trust you Whois it? Are you OK? For now I haven't seen Moemon around You don't have to worry about that Hmmm Stand guard until the police come Qutside the room? Wouldn't you be safer with me in here? I did my end of the bargain Now do yours! Alright Hide, hide! -In there!? -Don't argue! Go on! What now!? I already told you I'm OK! Huh? But how . ? -We locked this door! -Yes, we did' Then why is it open? Success. We smashed in that blog whore's face and buried the body Let's proceed to the next turn No. 3, please designate your target Please let it not be me! My target is the geek trifecta disgusting, nerdy, and noisy! I failed my exams hecause of the anime songs constantly blaring from his room! I want you to beat that ugly fuck over the head and then burn his body Sounds like a waste of human life You want it done with a hammer? Or by iron pipe? No I don't want to die! OK, let's assign the roles for killing this ugly fuck No. 4 will be the Preparer of Weapons No 1 will be the Killer. And No. 2 will be the Destroyer of Evidence I'l send that ugly fuck's location to No_ 1 Remember. the Word of GOD is absolute You will face a penalty if you fail to carry out your duties Everything here's supposed to have been locked! GOD's giving them the Target's location! How can he know that? -Moemon -Stay back! Don't make me hurt you! You came to Yacho's room, didn't you That's rather suspicious! Calm down! Knock it off! -You intend to kill us all? What? Of course it was you who killed M -What are you talking about!? -You're not fooling me You think I'm going to let you kill me? Then there's you It's always the quiet ones like you Just like in the movies! What the fuck!? Pull yourself together! Shut your mouth Wait. what are you doing? Cut it out! What do you think, Nana? people can kill their targets while maintaining a perfect alibi And the targets have no escape That's people for you Peaple will pursue revenge no matter how petty the motive, if they know they can get away with it It's fun to see how those in the depths of despair behave Isn't that right, Mio? You know what I'm talking about the joy of easily exacting revenge So. what are you going to do, Mio? This is bullshit Shut up If you're so sure it's one of us why not just run away instead? -Is this a car key? Yes Show me where it's parked Walk faster! How many times must I tell you? -Hurry up! -t's unlocked Really? Wait. this key So you like getting beaten! Don't you, you masochist! Where's Moemon? We're going to fight this time regardless of wha's the next target There's three of us, we have a fighting chance! Success. We beat that ugly fuck to death and burned his body Wow. No. 1, he's gotten even uglier, now that his face is all smashed up! It's a good thing we burned him Now it's the final turn No. 4, please designate your target I had this accident but this bitch just watched and laughed at me! That bitch was walking her fucking ugly dog It's not me! Had she quickly called an ambulance, my legs wouldn't be fucking useless! I'want every bone in her body broken and I want her to die from the shock! What a cold-hearted hitch! Of course she's got to die, but can't we also kill the dog? Huh? Ruruko... It's you? You're the target? What is this shit!? This is bullshit! Fucking bullshit! You It was you, hiding in your room this whole time? I didn't want to play to the point of becoming a target But did you enjoy the game? I did The Word of GOD is absolute Those who fail to carry out their assignments face a penalty No. 1 shirked her duties s0 she has heen penalized Penalty? What's the penalty? Ruruko! I can't believe it! There's something I want you to see -Is the tape rolling? -Yeah, it's rolling Punishment for this stupid schoolgirl whose half-assed sense of justice drove kids to their deaths She's over here Let's check it out What are you girls up t0? We're making dinner. Dinner? Oh, how nice Mudballs? Looks delicious! Mudballs! Mudballs! Won't you eat some mudballs? Come on, they're delicious! What will it be? You have to eat them! You simply must! They're yummy! I made them myself. you know! Come an, eat them! Come on! Maybe we got to make it easier for her to eat them Say something for the cameral It's Nanal -Nana's older sister, I presume? -Older sister? This video was quite a rare find Do you have any idea how hard it was for me to find it? How is it that you're alive...? I used the corpse of the commentator in that video as a decoy This stupid schoolgirl. She's over here Do you know why Nana killed herself? At first, I didn't know either. Nana had a strong sense of justice She made a website for bullying victims “That the World May Change Anan: Help! Anan: Won't anyone rescue me? Anon: I wish I were dead! This place for people to share their pain helped them cope At first, things went well, hut there got to be so many, Nana couldn't reply to all of them Some morons chose suicide, thinking that'd get back at their bullies After this string of suicides five years ago, Nana's sense of justice brought people together, but in a rather ironic way After that string of suicides, the bullies quieted down. However what actually happened next was mare shocking Hurry up and eat it! -She’s not going for it -Hurry up and eat it! You know, it's your fault that people are dead You couldn't have saved any of them!? You've no experience with bullying, but you butt in pretending to help! Some of us would've been OK had it just been the bullying She gave you more shit to deal with Tell her more! Were you ever serious about trying help us? -That's--I -Shut your mouth! We told you not to talk The stuff I wrote on your site got out and I got shit for it Now my parents are going to find out what's happened That sucks Are you going to really understand our pain this time? We'll make you understand! Do you feel any responsibility for those who killed themselves? We're giving you a lesson in the “facts of life!" Wait. where do you think you're going? Um, at this point I'd like to sign off! Hey, wait for me! Me firstl Me first! -Me? Me? -Yeah, you start Hold her down! Oh, that's good, really good How is it? Girls, show me her tits I Is there someone you want killed? Click here Nana wasn't the one who did wrong It's this world we live in We must break the chain of the weak going after only those even weaker But we're unable to go against the power of the majority We have to give the weak the chance, the power to change the world It's a crime to kill the human garbage the law won't bring to justice? That's bullshit Suicide is our only choice for revenge? That's also bullshit If it's so bad we're willing to kill ourselves shouldn't we instead work together to kil for revenge? If only the weak would join forces This thinking inspired me to create DeathPenalty com We've tested it out and it's now mostly perfected and give the weak their chance and their courage As Nana had hoped, so "That the World May Change.” The world... it'll change, won't it? At long last. I'm now able to do something for Nana To make sure there won't be any more victims like her. That's all we can do for her now Her death was a shock to me But ever since her death. I've tried my hardest, searching for an answer But you, you turned to booze you did nothing! That's I know it's been difficult for you Is there someone you want killed? Click here Surely. you must hate him Is there someone you want killed? Click here lunderstand how you feel, the pain of being unable to do anything for Nana But we can avenge Nana's death Just open this email and log in It might ease your pain, too Mio -chan I didn't really do it! Sure. it looks like I did it in that video, but I didn't really! Really!"! Don't worry is a more powerful weapon than all of these here on this table The site's up and running, is it not? Those in the white masks came and performed their kills. didn't they? Had there been a DeathPenalty com, the bullying would've quickly stopped and Nana wouldn't have suffered the fate she did Nana Nana Nana was a hit a hit selfish, but but always a kind gentle person She played the stoic Rarely-- Rarely said much but she always saw things for what they were What are you talking about?? On that day. That day I got a call from Nana, which was a rarity Yeah, what is it? Ah. [ finally got a hold of you No reason for calling really What are you doing? Nothing, just on my way to work She asked, "What are you doing? and I said, "Nothing." Then she said, "Oh, I see” Oh, I see. Hmm Just hear me out a sec I don't want to. Spare me the whining, OK? I thought of something, you know I always got this song stuck in my head It's a famous song “That the World May Change What they did to Nana was terrible but but I'm sure. I'm sure she wouldn't want anyone killed in revenge Somehow Somehow, I just know that -That's not the answer Nana's-- -I'm sorry! I'm sorry' I'm-- I'm sorry! Please forgive me! Y I'm really sorry! I'm really sorry! I'm sorry' I'm sorry' Is there someone you want killed? Click here I don't think Nana would forgive me if I took revenge But I will never forget Nana That's all I can do, but I think it's enough Iwill keep in my heart that final melody with which Nana left me and go on living That's the choice I've made Nana, Mio didn't go through with it Could it be the world doesn't need DeathPenalty com after all? But there are thase with such hate in their hearts that they need to kill If they knew of a way to get revenge without dirtying their hands. if they got an invitation to DeathPenalty com So. Nana What do you think will happen? I want to know So. I'm watching Here. with you, watching what happens with DeathPenalty com from now on Watching Watching s0 "That the World May Change.” Does everyone here have someone they want killed? Then, let's work together to do the killing The game is murder exchange A client is chosen one by ane The other three kill the target, the person the client wants killed thereby giving the client an alibi Everyone rotates between three roles The Preparer of Weapons. the Killer and the Destroyer of Evidence Do you understand the rules? If so Then let's begin!
