(GASPS) These things will kill you, my friend. (CHUCKLES) (GUNS COCKING) Blow it. (MUFFLED GUNSHOT) Avi, what is it? I don't know. We'll phone the guard room, find out. The gold? It's safe in the vault. Don't worry. (SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE) Dead. Quickly. Lock the door, I'll get my gun. (GUNSHOT IN DISTANCE) You, Avi. You're dead. (MACHINE GUN FIRING IN DISTANCE) Hello, old friend. Why are you doing all this? The army, the people will never follow you. I don't want your little country. What would I do with it? General, the area is secure. We have one man down, two wounded. Good. Take the dead man to the landing area. We leave no one behind. Why? Why all this killing? Why not? We walk from here. What's this? (CHUCKLES) Come on. (KATO EXCLAIMS) This is private property. SAMUELS: Hello, Cody. Samuels. May we, uh, come in? Jake, this is my friend Kindwe Kato. So you told me. What I didn't tell was that he is the chief political adviser for the new president. New president? Yes, or I should say the acting president. President Felliciano was killed in an attack on his residence last night. Who was it? General Carlos Da Costa. You sure of that? There's no doubt, it was Da Costa. I didn't know that Da Costa had any political ambitions. He doesn't. Our country is in the middle of delicate negotiations with the World Bank, under the directorship of the late President Felliciano. We are attempting to secure a loan with the World Bank with which to stabilize the area and attract foreign investment. Foreigners, as you both know are notoriously shy to invest in Africa because of the perpetual uncertainties here. We had hoped to secure that loan by depositing a substantial amount of gold in the bank as collateral. But Da Costa got to it first, right? Correct. We are continuing negotiations with the bank but without that gold... You see, we've lost considerable face because of the president's death. We can't have an international situation and we can't get at Da Costa, not officially anyway. Usual political bullshit. I am authorized to offer you a considerable sum if you can retrieve our property. I don't do this any longer. Please. This area is approaching political stability for the first time in 50 years. Living conditions are improving. Without that gold, without that loan, we cannot maintain that. Without that gold we can kiss this area goodbye. Isn't that enough justification? Mr. Cody, please. What assurance do I have that the gold will be used to benefit the people, or to relieve some of the poverty? You have my word for it. Mister... Kato. Mr. Kato. I don't take kindly to people who go back on their word Mr. Cody, I don't intend to. Good. Please come this way. This is the map of Kerampa and this is the border, Odinga. The river runs across here to Kisui, our neighboring country. This is Tesala, the capital. Da Costa is here. Our information maintains that, uh, Da Costa has a permanent base right here. Now, whatever men you need to hire, we'll pay for. Whatever... Whatever equipment you require, it's all yours. We are prepared to take you from Tesala, the capital, to the border. After that we cannot get involved. As it is, there's too much riding on this deal already. And as usual, you need action on it yesterday. Yes, I'm afraid we do, old chap. Look, I need a ride to the capital, huh? Give me a second to get my stuff. We'll use the border near Kamelania as a starting point. I need the equipment there by, say, 1500 hours. I'll give you a full breakdown in the car. Meanwhile, I want a full briefing. Everything you got on Da Costa before we take off. Everything you need, you'll get. (MOANING) Take the gun out of my face. You don't scare easily, right? (THUD) (SCREAMS) Who are you? Cody. Is, uh, Goliath downstairs, he belong to you? You mean Abu? Oh, shit, you didn't... No problem. I just dented him. He'll recover. You should teach him not point guns at strange men. That's exactly what I did teach him to do. Beth, do me a favor, go and see to Abu. Lovely girl. Yeah, take your word for it. This a social visit? Uh, business. Interested? I thought you retired like. No, I did, but, uh, this is kinda different. I get the feeling you're gonna tell me about. CODY: That's about it. Quick Smash and grab, in and out, minimum personnel, maximum fire power. I need you and two others. Uh, that's if you can fit it into your schedule. And it needs to be done yesterday. Any ideas? Well, there's Abu, for one. No, I, uh, know he's no great shakes up close, but you put a B-A-R in his mitt and he's hell on wheels. I'll take your word for it. Anyone else? Yeah. A little birdie tells me Crazy Ezra is looking to contract out. Crazy Ezra. Yeah. But I thought he bought it in Angola. Well, it seems he took a packet in the leg and ended up in a Cuban field hospital. He lay back for a month. All expenses paid like, and did a runner. Now, he's in the area and I know he needs this. Can you make contact? Well I'll get Beth to bang on the drums. Yeah, do that. Meet you back here at 1300. And we'll make for the jump off point. Bloody hell, you're not hanging about. We're on a schedule. Hey, what about, this. Standard plus 50. And a bonus for fast delivery. That's very tasty. JOE: And where the hell do you think you're shooting? Into the dirt? Now, put the stock into your shoulder, man. Hand up. Right. And look along the sights, will ya? Dig your feet in. Put your head along the sights. You're not gonna shoot anything like that. And get your leg up. Leg up, come on. Dig it in. Hand on the stock. Come on. Right. And where the hell do you think you are, on honeymoon? Get your leg into the ground, man. Come on. Concentrate, the lot of you. I told you, fingers off the trigger. And look along sights. And dig your feet in. Good man. Right, the moment of truth. Now let's see if we can hit the cans and not each other, shall we? Right, fingers on the triggers. In your own time. Fire. (GUNS FIRING) (SIGHS) Well? Ah, they still shoot for shit. I'm afraid I can't promise you another combat group by the end of the month. DA COSTA: Well, in that case you two will supervise security when I sell the gold. Um, I'm afraid we weren't contracted for that. We'll have to renegotiate. You will get your blood money. Your breed are all alike. But you will do well to remember that you are my guests here. Should that position change, I'm sure I need say no more. (EXCLAIMS ANGRILY) Lucky, calm down, calm down. Calm down, will ya? Your friend is wise to show you my disciplinary steps. You will do well to listen to him. Carry On. Are you totally bloody stupid? That man hero worships the likes of Idi Amin. With your big mouth we're likely to end up as part of the tree decorations. Okay, Doyle, I just... Yeah, but don't just again. When we deliver the gold, we keep our mouths shut, take the money and run, right. Right. And what the hell are you lot looking at? Keep your heads down and concentrate on the target. You heard the man. Now, fucking do it. (SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE) Go get Da Costa. General, we found this man sneaking around the perimeter. Then why is he still alive? My name is David Sikama. I'm a strong man. I'm healthy. I wish to be a warrior for the great General Da Costa. Well, take him to the compound. We'll find out if he has what it takes to be a great warrior. If not, I'm sure he has what it takes to be a tree dweller. MATTHEWS: No expenses spared for this trip, hey? I fought in armies that had less than this. EZRA: Yeah, especially after you left them. MATTHEWS: Yeah, well, a man's got to make a living, right? (EZRA CHUCKLING) Samuels. Is everything in satisfactory? Yeah, looks to be. Good, so you are ready. I don't know. We should cross the border by sun-up and be in position to hit the camp by midday. Oh. I thought it was traditional to hit 'em at dawn. If you want to get your ass blown off it is. Any military base worth shit has a stand to an hour before dusk and dawn, just for that reason. This is Africa. It's hot. Midday the sentries like to a nap. We'll hit 'em at noon. Good time. Well, I'll leave it in your more than capable hands. Here's all the information on the camp. Good stuff. Yeah, if everything goes according to plan we should be ready for chopper extraction by late afternoon tomorrow. There will be somebody monitoring your UHF band constantly until we hear from you. Good one. Good luck, Cody. Take it easy. Hey guys, let's move it. We're still about half a click from the border but no one ever got killed being too careful though. We'll secure this area, no fires though. Ezra, lay some claymores upfront. Abu, you take first watch. Secure the left flank. Take some extra frags. Go, let's get to it. Noveau. 3rd stream after Kerampa. Yeah. The glamour of it all. "Soldiers of Fortune." I've eaten worse. I bet you have. Not everything you eat is dead. Lying down maybe, but not dead. EZRA: Strange one, this Abu. Doesn't say much. We were on a sweep in northern Rhodesia. Some Aussie blokes, we were contracted to the Rhodesian army to do some covert search and destroy. We were chasing the ZIPRAs, and we came across this village, they burnt the whole fucking place down, they figured this village had been giving the scouts assist, so they torched the place and killed all the adults and chased the kids into the bush. Abu tried to help his mum, so they cut his tongue out and left him to die. Was 10 years old at the time. We called in a medevac for him and caught up with the ZIPRA blokes two days later. Fuck, we nailed the fuckers well and proper. When the war turned, I bugged out and came here and I brought him with me. I mean, I couldn't leave him there, could I? (SIGHS) So why'd you get him involved in all this shit? Don't you think he's seen enough war? Listen mate, we've all seen enough war. What we do is what we do. Abu's a 25-year-old man with no tongue. What else is there? (SIGHS) There's got to be more to life than all this. Oh, yeah! So what are you doing here? I'm going to relieve our silent friend. He too needs to eat. (COCKS GUN) Let's wait for Cody here. Black is beautiful. Make like a shadow. (LAUGHING) Oh, nice of you to drop in. You're welcome. The intelligence brief is pretty accurate, they've got about 40 men in the base and the perimeter security is pretty sketchy. This Da Costa thinks he's invincible. Yeah, and now for the good news. Only about two-thirds of the men are semi-trained and they've got Doyle and Lucky training the new men. Joe Doyle and Lucky Luke. The very same. (ALL LAUGHING) It's a small world. With any luck, we can persuade Joe and Lucky not to take defending Da Costa too seriously. JOE: Right gentlemen, let's reload. And let's try and hit something this time, shall we? Lucky, I'm just gonna crack the whip. Can you handle things here for a while. Yeah, right. Well, Doyle, how they hanging? See for yourself, Cody. Thought you'd retired. Who you got with you? We come in peace to this planet. Ezra, laddie. So, what's the story? We're taking this place down. JOE: Who've you got? The personnel. That I don't doubt. This place is strictly low rent. You got a problem with us coming in? Hey, be my guest. Go right ahead. Would you please inform our good friend Lucky of the situation. I would just hate for him to get damaged. He'll be happy as a pig in shit when I tell him. He's been waiting for a chance to grease Da Costa. Yeah, well he'll have to get in line. You've got yourself about three minutes to find yourselves a hole I hear you. (LAUGHING) Listen, we'll give Doyle a chance to get his shit together. Then Ezra will open the show with the thumper. Have you managed to locate the trained units yet? Roger on that, chief. The stupid fuckers are out in the open playing cards. Abu will take them with the Browning. Over. Great, wait for the signal. Ezra, you ready to make like the Fourth of July. Now I am ready. Ah, Lucky, it seems we have company. Mr. Cody and Ezra are here. If you'd be so good as to cover the gentlemen. Now, gentlemen, lessons are over for today. Could you please unload. (GUNS UNLOADING) And if you'd be so good enough to put your magazines in here. Thank you. Well done. That's great, lads. Now if you'd all be good enough to put your hands behind your heads and bury your faces in the dust. Do it now. Well, do it and do it now. Do it. (GUN COCKS) Thank you, Lucky. Now, if we all do as we are told we might come out of this alive. (MACHINE GUN FIRING) (CLICKING) Sam. How you doing, Cody? What the fuck are you doing here? It's what I do remember? I'm a journalist. Go where the story is. Year, well, get the fuck outta here. Like old times, eh, Sam. Gotta watch your ass again. You just keep watching your own ass, pal. Nice ass though. (GUNS FIRING) Who's got a nice ass? Do the rest of you turds feel enough about this hole to die for it? Do you? Get the fuck out of here! Go on! Get away from me! All clear. Yeah, looks that way. Hardly seems worth the walk. Thanks for the help, guys. All part of the service. (CAMERA CLICKS) (CAMERA CLICKING) Who the fuck is this? Oh, yeah. Jubosky. Samantha Jubosky. Call me Sam. Oh, uh, this is the great ass you were talking about. A journalist. Flying fucking circus. (MACHINE GUN FIRING) Da Costa. They have escaped. (CAMERA CLICKS) He killed my wife and my baby. (GROANING) Get you up, yet. Come on. Get the fuck out of here well. Fuck you, very much I take it you know the lady. Yeah, and if I never see here again, it won't be too soon. Nice little shape on her, though. Matthews, Abu, fetch that trunk inside here. The rest of you, get their weapons, destroy them. And get rid of the bodies. Come on, guys, let's do this. (GROANING) What the fuck is this, Cody? I'm gonna rupture myself carrying this bleeding thing. It's what we came for. Well, I know that. What the fuck is it? (SIGHS) Fucking hell. Cody, uh, me and the lads have been talking about this, uh, gold here. Well, you see, we feel it would be a terrible waste to go traipsing all the way back to Kerampa with it, you know. Cody, we can be rich men with that gold. We can give up all this shit. We contracted to do a job. Getting the gold back is part of the deal. Come on, Cody. Join us in the real world. Be fucking reasonable. This is bullion, gold. Not some boy scout treasure hunt. Forget it. The gold goes back. Oh, yeah? Yeah. (GRUNTS) What the fuck do you think you're doing? I'm gonna shoot the fucker. Back off! And if I don't? I'll blow your fucking head off and use your ball bag as a tobacco pouch. Fuck you. (GUNS COCKING) I'll shoot you so fast you'll think you were surrounded. You were saying? Yeah, that's better. Much, much better. You see, Cody saved your life today. It was his call to warn you. We owe him. Matthews, if we leave him alive he'll come after us, you know what he's like. He's right, you know. Me and Cody go back a long way. No, no, no, he won't be following us. (GUNSHOT) (CAMERA CLICKING) Ah, shit! Got you, you bitch! Ah, fuck! Calm down, me darling, let's not get silly I'm not being silly, you son-of-a-bitch. (SAMANTHA GRUNTING) (GROANS) Shit! Come on, laddie, pull yourself together. MATTHEWS: Right, so that's the coast, right. Where does that put us? There. Yeah. That's simple then, right? We walk here due east, cross the Rubicana there to the coast. This whole area here between the Kavinga mountains and the Rubicana river is Saduka territory, man. So what? Haven't you heard the stories? Man, there's thousands of the little bastards... A bunch of spear chuckers in animal skins. Are you going soft or what? You haven't really heard, eh? No, no, no you're right. We'll call a cab. (LAUGHING) And you call me crazy. Now what are we going to do with this? She just tried to score a conversion with Lucky's family jewels. I tell you she's a right handful. We take her with us. What? Or we kill her? No. (CODY GASPING) How long? Can't be sure. But the spoor's quite clear. I think they left here before sundown yesterday. It's about 11:00 now. Who are you? My name is David. You must try not to talk. (GROANS) You have a broken rib. However, I was able to clean up your wound and stop the bleeding. Shit. Matthews. Don't worry. I'll get you a drink. So judging from the spoor they went to the east. Two men are carrying a heavy load. They have a captive. Sam. Do you know the person? Who, Samantha? Sure, she's a photojournalist. We go back a long way. I've been bumping into her ever since. She. That explains the spoor. You read the ground well. How do you do that? I work on a game farm in the north. I came here only to avenge my family. Da Cost and his killers have been doing some dirty work for the government here. My family was killed in a raid. Revenge for some missing corn. I came here to kill Da Costa, but I was caught before I could get near him. Your attack gave me a chance and I killed the swine. I thank you for that. Sure. And I thank you for this. Whatever it is, I feel the better for it. What is it? It is Sikila. The old women of my tribe say it has a healing power. Sikila. What are you going to do now? I guess I'll have to go after Matthews, get the gold, save the girl and all that shit. No. They go to the east. So? The tribes of the Saduka are in the east. Oh, fuck it. It's got to be done. You shouldn't do this, man. They went to the east, they are already dead. I ain't got no choice. Every man has a choice in all things. Not me, man. I never have. You are a fool, man. Your words scares me. The Saduka scare me more. We cross this area and head for the coast there. Doyle, me and Ezra we're gonna go into town. We're gonna go to the harbor and we're gonna get a boat. Then we're gonna come back for you lot and the gold, right? Fuck off, will you, you freak show. You're all mine, sweet pants. Go dick yourself. Sweet, aren't they? (CHUCKLES) Yeah. Eh? Look, tomorrow we've got to cover our tails. Now, you're the expert. I want us to disappear. Is it? Yeah. Yeah, well. No, fine. So, you are worried about Cody following us? No, Doyle, I'm just being careful. Your men did a great job. There is more food than you could ever carry. But these are the only weapons they missed. Yeah well, they'll have to do. You mean to do this even though it will mean your death? Someone's got to do it. If I don't, who will? Pass me my ruck. My radio's still here. At least I can call for extraction once I've found Matthews. That's if I ever find Matthews, right? Go well, friend. David, take it easy, man. Thank you. Matthews. We're gonna have to hit the river for at least a click to hide our tracks. All right. Well, let's keep it tight. And that includes you. If we get bounced while we're in the river, we're in a world of pain. All right, I'll take point. They camped here on the first night, while you were still unconscious. They make very poor time. They don't even cover their trail. They will. What made you come? You need a tracker, but you didn't try to persuade me to come. Everyman's gotta do what he thinks is right. Not for me to change another man's mind. This is a foolish thing we do. They went that way. Think you can use one of these? The gold is slowing them down. If we keep up this pace we should catch them soon. If we ourselves are not caught up first. EZRA: Matthews. MATTHEWS: Yeah? Here. This was last night's fire. They slept here. They tried to cover the trail. See this grass here. They passed by here and straightened the grass. A good tracker looks below the grass. They did not cover the prints. There's a river about four clicks from here. Let's try to make it before sundown so we can see where they crossed. I will find where they entered the water, but it won't be easy to find where they left it. Let's try and make it before dark. We'll pick up the trail in the morning. JOE: Holy Mary, this is fucking heavy. Lucky, how far are we from the river? About one click. All right. You go ahead. Find us a safe place to bivouac. Call halt. Yeah, right. Come on, Doyle. Leave me alone. That's fucking it, bitch. Now you're mine. Now you're mine. What the fuck is it you're doing? I'm teaching her a lesson. Are you outta your bloody mind? This, in the words of John bleeding Wayne, is Injun territory. You fuck up here and we stay here. Have you got that? When we get to the coast you can do with the bitch what you fucking want. But until then, don't fuck with me. Hey, man, it's not you I wanna fuck with. (LAUGHING) Very funny, sweetheart. Very funny. Go and relieve yourself. I mean, Doyle. (WHISTLES) Tracks. They must have come outta here. Come on, let's go. No. Why? What's up? The man who walks the well worn trail walks where others will want him go. (MOUTHS) Bomb. Cody, they left the river here. Sure? Yes. The trunk caught the rock as they pulled it up. I can see a boot print on the rock. All right. They left here before sunset yesterday. The man who covers their trail is very good. Yeah, Crazy Ezra. I thought he was the best. Thank you. They are no more than three hours away if we move quickly. How do you figure that? They are very tired and the gold slows them down. This campsite is very messy. They left long after sun up. Like I said, they are very tired. Good. Let's do it. Wait, we are not the only ones on the trail. What's that supposed to mean? The spoor is very slight. But I can see it. The Saduka have been here. Let's get outta here. We'll take five here. LUCKY: Thing's fucking killing me. MATTHEWS: Think of it as your life savings. You got a light, Ezra? Can I have some water, please? Well, seeing as you're asking so nicely... Ezra. (JOE EXCLAIMS) (EZRA SCREAMS) You come on, Lucky. MATTHEWS: Lucky! Shit. Ezra! Ezra! (JOE GROANING) Give me a hand there, man. (EZRA LAUGHING) Ezra, I can't get up. I can't get up. Shit! (SAMANTHA WHIMPERS) So you need exercise, do you? I've got her. I'll give you exercise, bitch. Fuck! Matthews! (SAMANTHA SCREAMING) Stupid fucker! Ezra, they took the girl. (GUN FIRING) Come on. Right, come on. (GUNS FIRING) Come on! (GUN FIRING IN DISTANCE) The firings coming from about three clicks from here. Let's move. Watch your ass. It could get rough. Cease fire, cease fire! Cease fire! What? I said... Ah, fuck it. Where's the girl? The hostiles got her. Ah, poor bitch. LUCKY: Fuck her. Take a look at me. Well, you're bloody lucky that's not in your bloody head. Now, are we all all right? Eh? Now that's apart from Sinbad here? Yeah? Good. Now we've got about two hours of sunlight left. Let's keep it frosty and move out. Wait, I see it now. This spoor and the signs we found back there, I see it now. See what? What's happening? The girl escaped. The soldiers fired and left through the bush and the Saduka left along the path. They have the girl. Shit! Son-of-a-bitch! We'll have to go in and get her. It may already be too late. We got to go anyway. Come on, let's go. Ezra. We got to have to get invisible. Tell me something I don't know. (DRUMS BEATING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) We are too late. Yeah, and will you look at the stupid bitch. She's loving it. Come on. We've got to move fast. (LOUD GROWLING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) Eff off, Cody. I'm having a good time. Take it easy, honey, you ain't the guest of honor here. What? You're the main course. Shit! (SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE) He says he could see you are a great magic man, as I have told him. He asks if you would join the feast. Tell him sure, but tell him this animal is too skinny and her flesh is not good. Tell him that she will not be good for eating. (SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE) Tell him he should give her to me and I will make good magic with her. Tell him that her flesh will not taste good. You're an asshole. You want I should leave you here? The head man says you can have the girl. He knows of other animals around here. CODY: Matthews. Tell him that we also seek those other animals. Tell him if he interrupts us or attacks us in our search I will bring... I will bring a great fire out of the sky. (EXPLOSION) (SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE) CODY: Well, I guess that's the end of the dinner party. That way. (DART TWANGS) (GASPS) SAMANTHA: Thanks, Cody, for what you did back there. Hey, forget it. Saving your ass is becoming a way of life for me. First it was the delta, then it was... Can't you ever accept some thanks without being such a smart ass. David. Sure. Friends? Yeah. So what's next? Next, uh, I guess I might have to a kill a guy that I've known for almost 20 years. (GUN COCKS) I say we go and look for Lucky. We can't just leave him. The Saduka took him in the night my friend. He's long dead. Yeah, but man we're talking about Lucky here. Look, he's fucking dead. Now we need to get out of here, right. His luck ran out. Yeah, but Matthews, it's... Matthews... Yeah, all right. Sure. Good man, Doyle. Just stay cool, huh. (DART TWANGS) Ezra! Come on. DAVID: They were here last night. I found this. One of them was taken by the Saduka. Looks like Lucky Luke just became plain old Luke. Or Luke the lamb chop. Right. Let's do it. Nothing. Not a fucking hit. It's like they were never here. Tell that to Doyle. Well, let's get out of this carp hole. You okay? Why shouldn't I be? Take it easy. I was just wondering. You're just saying that I'm a woman in the bush and that I can't handle myself. Look, Sam, even if you had a beard and balls, I'd be concerned about you after what's gone down the last few days. Okay? Okay. You all right. Yeah, fine. (CALLING INCONSPICUOUSLY) The Saduka took another one here. Can you tell which one? The other one from the camp. Two down, three to go. (SIGHS) You looking a little rough, Sam. Fuck you, Cody. Matthews came out of the bush. They talk here and they left that way. Matthews and the little man. They're carrying the gold. And the big man is picking up the trail. They didn't cover the spoor. I think they do it before dark. We'll have to try and reach the point before sundown. That way we can finish this thing tomorrow. We've still got three hours of the sun. Let's go. You coming? I was out of this thing. Damn, you, Matthews. We were friends. (GROANS) Matthews, we'll spend the night here. Yeah, we should be able to make the coast tomorrow. All right. Here. You two get some sleep. I'll take first watch. My mate, was it really all worth it? Is it ever? Is it ever? (LAUGHING) I'm no expert but this is the place, huh? Yes. Do your stuff, maestro. They were here about four hours ago. They wanted us to know this. They walked the area and left much. They meant for us not to see anything by letting us see too much. Do you know which way they went? One of them stumbled and left one print, just one. This is the way they went. Great stuff. I owe you one. Go take some rest we'll camp here for the night. Okay. Make an early start in the morning. (SIGHS) Some years back we were on a job in South America. Got a contract to track down some huge drug cartel. Me, Matthews, my brother and a group of vets. We were sweeping through a village, a little village, Santino. It was clean so we decided to bug out, but I couldn't find my brother. I went back to the village and I heard this screaming from some hooch. I found Rick. He was raping some little girl. Just a baby, man. Ten, maybe 12 years old. I told him to stop. I screamed at him to stop. And he just... He just laughed. He just laughed at me. I grabbed him and I pulled him off her. He turned on me with a knife. My own brother. I shot him in the face. It wasn't him in there. He wasn't like that. He was kind. Gentle. But it's this thing we do. This thing I do. Even if you're fighting on the right side trying to get... Trying to do good, somehow, somewhere it just all gets mixed up inside. (BIRDS CALLING) Where's Ezra? Wake up, damn it? Shit. They've got Ezra. Oh, bloody hell. You. Don't even try it, big guy. (DART TWANGS) (SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE) They say they want the other animal. Cody. Tell them no. He's mine. (SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE) He says the pale one is yours, the animal belongs to them. Tell them no. (SPEAKS LOCAL LANGUAGE) Why, Cody? Why'd you follow us? What do you care? I've always cared. You knew that. Well, it's a bit too late for that now. I just saved your ass. Well, I'm sorry, old chap. There's just too much gold for sentiment. It's the end of the line now. (GROANS) Once too often, Matt.
