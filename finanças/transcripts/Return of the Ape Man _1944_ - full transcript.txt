(dramatic music) (suspenseful music) If we are successful Professor Dexter, your discovery will rock the scientific world. We will be. The temperature in the chamber is how normal. We can go in. Attach the electric impulses, I'll prepare the injection. (electric sizzling) Turn it off, for now. We've been waiting four months for this moment. How can you be so calm? His eyes are twitching, there's life! He's coming to! Thank you Gilmore. I told you I would. Hey, hey, huh... Hey how'd I get here, where am I? Take it easy, you'll be all right. [Tramp] Huh? Here, drink this. What happened? Who are yous guys? Do you feel all right? Yeah, yeah, I feel all right, only, a little weak in the knees. Ooh... Holy smokes I'm cold! We found you asleep in the park, you were... Yeah, yeah I remember, drunk again. Well I sure had a load on (laughs). Hey have I been here all night? - Yes. - I have? You must be hungry. - Yeah. - Here. Go out and get yourself a good meal. Five bucks! Oh, me for the Waldorf Astoria! Hey, if you fellas want to find me again, anytime, I'll be on that same bench (chuckles)! [Gilmore] So long, we may look you up. So long fellas! It's incredible, he didn't remember a thing. I wonder what he'd say if we told him he's been frozen solid for four months, in sub-zero temperature without food or water? He wouldn't believe it. Neither would anyone else, but you've proved your theory Professor Dexter. If I can suspend animation for four months, I can do it for four years, or, perhaps 400 years. Unfortunately we couldn't live long enough to prove that, my dear Dexter. But suppose, we were to find a body, that has been frozen, for perhaps thousands of years. Oh but that's impossible. For scientists, nothing is impossible. I didn't mean that my dear Dexter. I meant the finding of such a body. That's what I wish to discuss with you. Come to my study. (dramatic music) (relaxing music) (picks thumping) I'm convinced, this is the habitat of early man, maybe 50, or 100,000 years ago. You're undoubtedly right, Dexter. But we've been up in this frozen wilderness for 10 months now, isn't it beginning to look rather hopeless? After all we're looking for a needle in a haystack, so to speak. [Dexter] You have something on your mind, what is it? I suggest we abandon the search. It seems so hopeless. We might stay here for years, and never find anything but tusks, and skeletons. [Dexter] Quite true. Then again, we may find what we're after! Yeah, one chance in a million! The odds are too great against us. Let's go home. You can go if you want to. I'll stay on. Oh please don't misunderstand me Dexter. I don't want to leave you here alone, I can't! And after all, I'm a married man with a family. I'm married too. You are? A true scientist is married to his profession. No sacrifice too great. (thunderous cracking echoing) Come, we see man! One chance in a million, and we've won! [Gilmore] The greatest discovery since the Neanderthal man! - Dynamite? - No dynamite! Picks only. (wind howling) Be very careful! And you were ready to give up! I'm sorry Dexter. Our real work will begin, when we get home. (dramatic music) Hello Helen. - Hello. - How are you Frank? - Hello. - I'm so glad you were both able to come! We're very happy to be here. Won't you go in and join the others? - Thank you. - Thank you. (electrical humming) The body looks to be intact. Yes. The thawing out process must be made with very great care, so that the change of temperature is not too violent. (tense music) It's hard to believe he's been dead, for centuries. How do you know he's dead? (chuckles) I don't know, he may have been swept up, alive, in a glacial torrent, and frozen in the sudden sub-zero temperature. I had no idea it was so late. My wife will be wondering what's become of our guest of honor. I better phone the house and tell her I'll be late for the party. (torch hissing) What is it Anne? Uncle John just phoned, he and Professor Dexter are going to be late, They're in the middle of a very important experiment. Oh how provoking! But I blame it all on that Professor Dexter, he's impossible! (chuckles) You sound as if you don't like that man. I don't, he frightens me. I have a feeling that no good will come to John from associating with him. You know sometimes I think Professor Dexter is mad! (laughing) Don't take Aunt Hilda too seriously darling! She took a dislike to the Professor the first time she saw him and she's never gotten over it. And I never will! Mark my words, your Uncle John will rue the day he ever became associated with that impossible person. Well now I'm look forward to meeting the Professor with added interest! (chuckling) A perfect specimen of Pithecanthropus! Neither man nor ape. I was right. It's alive! I can't believe it! (grunting) Get back! (grunting) (thumping) (grunting) Go back I say! (whip cracking) (grunting) He'll kill us! He shall serve his master! (grunting) Get back! Back! Back I say! (grunting) Do you see, fire is his master! He probably never understood it! Open the door! (suspenseful music) Get back, get back, get back! Get in! (grunting) (thumping) How will you get him over to the Museum of Natural History? And what makes you think that that is my plan? What else can you do with him? How will the world know of your achievement? They will know in time. But first I shall try an experiment on him. May I ask what you intend to do? Certainly. I keep no secrets from you, to the contrary, I'm relying on your help. Thank you. What do you intend to do with this, ape-man? Well, I shall try to transplant the segment of the brain of the present-day man into the skull of that prehistoric creature, endowing him with just enough understanding, to make him obey my orders. Why not an entire brain? No, that would remove his entire connection with his former life. I must leave him enough of his own brain to stimulate his memory. I see. Then you'll transplant just enough brain to vest him with the faculty of speech, and slight reasoning power without disturbing the instincts and impulses of his former life. Exactly. Why to do that you'd have to take part of the brain away from a living man. That's right. Where will you find anyone willing to do that? Give part of his brain to science? There's great danger, in fact, almost a certainty he would die in the operation. That would be murder! Murder is an ugly word. As a scientist I don't recognize it. We better hurry, my wife will think we're never coming. Yes, let's get it over with. You want to tell her of our discovery? No, not a word! Not till I'm ready to announce it to the world. (giggling) I'm just dying to hear all about your adventures, Professor. There isn't very much to talk about after all. It must have been terribly lonesome up there all alone without your wife! - What a break! - What's that George? Why uh, I merely said, uh, what a mistake! (laughing) You're very quiet Professor. Yes, I was just thinking. I enjoy studying people. You know, some people's brains would never be missed. I've often thought that (chuckling). You know Professor Gilmore, I always wanted - to be an explorer. - Oh. But could never find time to get away from the office. (chuckling) I'm going to ask Uncle John to play something for us. He'll be glad to get away. Uncle John won't you play something for us please? Oh I've probably forgotten how to play by this time Anne. Oh come on, play that piece I like so much, you know, Moonlight Sonata? Oh but it's so sad! - Oh come on please! - Yes do! - Yes Prof... - Come on, I'd love to - hear it John, please. - All right, you asked for it. He hasn't played for a long time. Wonderful. ("Moonlight Sonata") Are you interested in science, Mr. Rogers? Only from a distance Professor. I'm much more interested in my own work. - What's that? - Studying law. Hmm, a noble profession. It requires a keen mind and a good sense of logic. I don't know about that. (chuckling) I think I'd better be going. Oh, so early? Yes, I'm conducting a very important experiment which requires my attention, and it's a long walk home. You see, I don't drive. Oh let me drive you back in my car. Oh, that would be awfully kind of you! I'll just tell Anne where I'm going. Oh there is no need to bother Miss Gilmore, you'll be right back. Let's go. Well, goodnight Professor. Oh, won't you come in for a few minutes? Oh, thanks, but I think I better get back. But just for a little while, we'll drink a toast to the happiness of yourself and your lovely fiancée! I can't refuse that. ("Moonlight Sonata") Oh that was beautiful Uncle John, please play some more! Not now, later perhaps. Where are Professor Dexter and Steve? Oh don't worry about them! Professor Dexter has probably got Steve in a corner somewhere giving him a lecture on evolution. Come, sit down Mr. Rogers. There are cigarettes, help yourself. Thank you. (suspenseful music) To your happiness! And to the success of your experiment, Professor! Will you excuse us a moment, please? - Certainly. - (mumbling) Have you seen Professor Dexter? He probably found our company too uninteresting and left! Where's Steve? - I don't know. - Did he go with Dexter? Really John, I don't see why you should be so concerned. I have reason to be concerned, I've got to find them! Will you make my excuses to our guests? But John! (tense music) Anything wrong, Mr. Rogers? Strange, I feel so sleepy all of a sudden. Yes, it is a bit stuffy in here, I'll open the window. Thanks. (grunting) (bars thumping) Stop, or I'll kill you! Why, dear Gilmore! You're not going to use him for a guinea pig! Put that knife away and give him an injection to bring him to or I swear I'll kill you Dexter. Well, if you're so interested in Mr. Roger's well being, I can hardly refuse you. All right, go ahead. There, he'll be all right in a few minutes. (grunting) Will he remember anything about this? No, I drugged him. He will remember nothing. All right, help me carry him upstairs before he recovers. All right. Goodnight Mrs. Gilmore, we've had a wonderful time. Too bad we've seen so little of your husband. I'm very sorry. Don't forget to tell Steve goodbye for us! - I will, thank you. - Goodnight. Goodnight! Why I wonder what could have happened to. Uncle John and Steve? Your Uncle has behaved most disgracefully. But I blame it all on that Professor Dexter! (sighing) (moaning) Hey what happened to me? Mr. Gilmore, what are you doing here? Professor Dexter phoned me, he thought you were ill. Oh. I'm awfully sorry. I seem to remember getting sleepy, but... You're probably over-worked. Maybe so, as a matter of fact I haven't slept much all week. If you're feeling better now Steve, you'd better be getting back. - Anne's worried. - Oh sure I'm all right. Well Professor good night. Awfully sorry I passed out on you. Think nothing of it. Run along Steve, Tl follow you in a few minutes. Okay. That was the most contemptible thing a man ever tried to do to his friend! My dear Gilmore! You deliberately tried to murder someone dear to me! He might not have died. That's a comforting thought to you. Did you think what it might mean to that boy? If he lived the operation would leave him an idiot. - And what about scien... - Don't give me that science stuff! Science does not demand such stupid sacrifices! Science does not demand murder in its behalf! Dexter you're a dangerous man, my wife warned me against you, and her intuition was right, I believe you're quite mad! I see you and I do not think alike! No we don't, that's why I'm telling you now I never want to see you again, or have anything more to do with you! My last bit of advice to you is to get rid of that horrible thing you have caged up. Destroy it, I beg of you, destroy it! If it should manage to get away, the primitive instinct in it would be to kill! And it's you who'd be held responsible, not that thing! Thank you. If I need advice from you, I'll ask for it. Goodnight. Fool. You'll pay for this. (tense music) (electrical buzzing) (suspenseful music) (electrical buzzing) This isn't intended for you, my friend. (suspenseful music) Go! Get in! (grunting) (cell door rattling) (thumping) (crashing) (glass breaking) (dramatic music) (grunting) (dramatic music) Back! (grunting) I'll show you who is Master! (grunting) Back! I'll show you who is Master! (dramatic music) (bars thumping) (screaming) All right, break it up, break it up! What goes on here? Get back! Get back or I'll shoot! (screaming) (policeman groaning) [Woman] Help! You fool, brainless fool! Get out, get home! (dramatic music) What's the matter Uncle John, you look worried? Oh nothing Anne, I was just... Pardon me Mr. Gilmore, you're wanted on the telephone. Oh thank you Susan. Excuse me. Hello? Hello Gilmore. This is Dexter. Yes. I knew you must have read about it. It's terrible. I was just about to finish my breakfast and go to the police. I'm glad you decided to do what I urged. Had you done it sooner it would have saved the poor man's life. Of course I'll help you do away with it. Well we'll talk about that later, goodbye. Yes, I'll be right over. I'm sorry my dear, but something terribly important's come up and I've got to go immediately. But you haven't finished your breakfast John. That's what you get Aunty for marrying a Professor. Be sure and be back for lunch John, and don't forget we're going to the concert this afternoon. I'll be back in time. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I'm so grateful to you, Gilmore, for coming. I wouldn't have come for any other reason but the killing of the ape. Now, come come. I can understand the way you feel about me. I don't blame you. Nevertheless, as a public minded citizen I must still report to the police how the poor man happened to have been killed. (electrical buzzing) So my self-righteous friend, was going to tell the police, huh? (chuckling) You trusting, stupid fool. What are you going to do to me? (tense music) Now I know you're insane. The ape-man after I finish with him, he'll no longer have the primitive instinct to kill. He'll be a righteous citizen, just like you are. You know why? Because part of your brain, the righteous part, will be in him. I know there's no use pleading with you Dexter, I have only this to say. If someone has to be the victim of your madness, then I'm glad it's me, not Steve or some other innocent person. Because I feel partly responsible for this whole mess. Spoken like a true scientist. Where do you suppose he can be? He promised to be home for lunch and the concert. Oh he's probably with Professor Dexter. No he told me that he and Professor Dexter are through. Still something might have come up that would take him there. Come on Anne, we'll drive over. - All right. - Now stop worrying, Mrs. Gilmore, we'll find him. Thanks Steve! (suspenseful music) How do you feel? You feel, all right? He's a success! I have advanced his mind 20,000 years, in a few hours. (doorbell ringing) Rest. - Hello. - Oh. This is an unexpected pleasure. We hate to disturb you Professor Dexter, but is Uncle John with you? What makes you think he might be here? Well we just thought he might be. He left home without finishing his breakfast and he hasn't been back since. Oh, is that so unusual? Well, in this case yes. You see, we were all going to a concert, and he hasn't even phoned. I'm so sorry, I wish I could help you. Maybe he went to his club? Maybe he did, thank you. You know Steve, I'm convinced Professor Dexter knows where Uncle John is. What makes you say that? Well, call it woman's intuition or whatever you like. But why should the Professor want to lie about it? I don't know, but I think we ought to tell the police. We'd better wait a bit before we do that. We can't just jump to conclusions Honey. You know Steve, I'm beginning to think. Aunt Hilda was right about Professor Dexter. Maybe you're right Honey. (engine revving) You understand, everything I say to you? Me, Gil-more. Gil-more. No, you're not Gilmore. What is your real name? (groaning) All right, all right. It takes a little time, perhaps another operation. No, no, no! Come back! Come back you fool! (tense music) I really think we ought to call the police. No, that would only cause a scandal. I can't stand any more of this. Oh Aunt Hilda why don't you go upstairs and get some rest, we'll wait down here. Promise to call me if something happens? I promise. Then I'll go. I wonder where he can be. Anne I've got a hunch he's in trouble. Well if he doesn't show up soon, I'm going to call the police whether Aunt Hilda likes it or not. Okay. (tense music) (piano note playing) ("Moonlight Sonata") Listen, someone's playing the piano upstairs! That must be Uncle John! That's his favorite piece! But how'd he get in? Maybe he's been in the house all the time. Let's go upstairs and see! Let's go. Is that you John? I've been worried to death! (tense music) Why there's no one here! (screaming) - What was that? - Aunt Hilda! - She's dead! - Oh I can't believe it! I thought I saw someone going out of the window just as we came in! Get the police, quick! (suspenseful music) Huh, uh! Neck's broken, just like the other case. Any money or jewelry missing? No I don't think so. What do you suppose his motive is Sergeant? Just plain murder by the look of it. Well my fiancé chased him across the garden. You stay here until the coroner comes, come on with me Tony. Sarge, here's a footprint! Ah, that's too big to be real. Here's another one! Hey what's this? (Steve groaning) That thing- Say, what happened to you? The thing, where is it? - Where's what? - It knocked me down! Ah, take it easy fellow, who was it? No no, it wasn't a man, it was a, it was like a, like a big ape! It killed Mrs. Gilmore, I saw it climb through the window! Did you see which way it went? I don't know, but I got a good idea where it came from! Come on! Move on, move on, let's go down! Where have you been? (groans) My home. Did you kill somebody again? I kill Hilda. Mrs. Gilmore! Why did you kill her? - Didn't mean to. - This is the house. I'm sure Dexter knows something about it. [Sergeant] I hope you're right. (doorbell ringing) Get in there you fool! Get in there, do as I say! Go! (door rumbling) (doorbell ringing) Good evening gentlemen. Why, Mr. Rogers, what brings you here this time of night? We're looking for someone. Maybe I can help you? Do you mind if we look around Professor? No, not at all. I, you think that somebody, entered this house? It's possible. That monster, where is it? Monster? I don't know what you're talking about. You will when we find it. Nothing in there. Looks like we're barking up the wrong tree. Are you satisfied, Mr. Rogers? I'm not so sure. Where's that door lead to? Oh that leads to my laboratory. You may want to inspect that too? Well we might as well as long as we're here. [Dexter] Very well. Follow me. Kind of an interesting setup you have here Professor. Yes I'm proud of it. (thumping) What was that noise? It must have been next door. Well maybe we better go around, see what's out there. (thumping) (wooden crackling) (dramatic music) There it is, that's the thing that killed Mrs. Gilmore! - (groaning) - For the love of Pete, what is it? (gun firing) (dramatic music) Oh no, get a, get away! Get away! (gun firing) (grunting) You knew all about it huh? I brought it to life. What is it? It is a prehistoric man, with part of Gilmore's brain. Gilmore? Yes... In the interest of science. You must destroy that thing. Well how, bullets don't seem to faze it? There is, only one way. Fire... So that's why it went to Gilmore's house. It may go back there again! Well if you see him please ask him to come right over, I'm frightened. Yes, thank you. (screaming) (dramatic music) Oh let go of me! (screaming) Very pretty. You will come with me. I'll get it. (glass breaking) (dramatic music) All right. There it goes, it's got Anne! No no no! That won't do any good, you might hit her! I'll send out an alarm! (dramatic music) Give me police headquarters! Station 42, quick! Are you kidding? But I tell you I saw it with my own eyes, call out everything you got! Okay, okay! McGinnes! Put out this alarm. Call all cars in this vicinity, be on the lookout for an escaped maniac somewhere loose in the city! Looks more like an ape than a man. Was last seen carrying off a girl. This character is dangerous! Okay. (dramatic music) Look! Let's go back and try and catch him on the other side! (thumping) (crashing) (thudding) Hey what's going on here? (dramatic music) (grunting) He's in this building! Get the other boys and bring the torches! Right! There he is up there! Light your torches and spread out! Remember no shooting! Barney, guard that exit! Three of you boys go up that ladder, we'll go up here, we've got to corner him! Get back boys! (crashing) (Anne screaming) (dramatic music) They will not find you now. (thudding) (screaming) We'll have to break it down! Let me out, please let me out, please! Please let me out! (electrical crackling) Please! (electrical crackling) (electrical sizzling) (electrical popping) (gun firing) (laboratory exploding) - Look out! - (gun firing) Oh, the place is on fire! Don't be a fool, you can't make it! Anne's down there! (sound of explosions) (flames crackling) (coughing) [Sergeant] Help me get them outside! - All right! - (coughing) Are you all right Honey? Oh Steve! Take it easy, everything's gonna be all right. Well this is one time I hope the fire department lets it get a good start. (sound of explosions) (poignant music)
