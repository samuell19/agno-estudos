In the modern cities where all the darkness are said to be gone, there still exists the darkness that is everlasting from the ancient times. The darkness of the dead that appears on the verge of this world. The underworld is always waiting for a chance to drag us down into the dark side. And there is another darkness that is still growing. Haven't you forgotten where the darkness grows most enormously? Yes, it grows within our distorted heart. Sometimes the camera captures the darkness of such moment. The videos that are born from the darkness and to be buried in the darkness. Let us introduce you what camera catches in the darkness. Tokyo Videos of Horror Video holder: Masato Sakaguchi It's been a while ago... in the middle of September... when I was playing with the fireworks with my ex-girlfriend at the river. Late summer night -It explodes! -Hey, stop it! If you scare me, you do it. Alright, hold the camera. Thanks. Here it comes! Here it goes! Very nice! Now it ends. How shabby. By that time, I was working at video company. I was thinking I could make a nice video by editing this with the ones at the sea. I just wanted to show her the video. I thought that would be a good memory for us. Now...honestly speaking...I don't want to remember about this video. Fireworks are so beautiful! Look what I will do! Be careful! It's dangerous. Be careful! Don't hurt yourself! This could be a nice image video of the summer. -Now show me your tits. -What? Sorry. Suddenly, there is a noise of a stone falling off. Someone's there. Someone's up there. There. Someone. Who? I'm sure someone was there. Maybe a homeless. No...no homeless. I mean, much smaller. A kid? I don't know. If that was a kid, not very safe at this time of the night. Something came rolling, and... I looked up and there was something... Someone was there. It was probably a size of a kid. A kid Here it comes! And then gone already. Very quick. Did you hear that? There is a voice from a distance. Did you hear that? Let's record some horror! What? Noway. -Come on! Let's go. -No. We'll look for the kid. Well, but... The couple walked towards where the voice came from. Are you alright? Did you hear that now? Which direction was it from? From there. Warning: The image you will see next moment might give you a serious impact to your mind and body. If you are unwilling to see, please stop playing or please start watching from the next chapter. We do not bear any responsibilities. Oh, no! The police! We found the dead body. We reported it to the police as soon as we could. We were the first one to find that out and the police asked us how we found it. So we give them the video. Later I heard that it was a child of a homeless who lived up along the river. The child was a girl. She was a retarded kid. At first, she was supposed to be drowned. Then there were lots of bruises all over her body. She was obviously abused. And her father was arrested by the police. But while he was detained, he hanged himself to death. He is assumed to have some sort of psychological problem. We verify the image of when the stone came rolling. Someone's there. Please watch it again with slow motion. Suddenly there appears a small shadow at the riverbed. It seems that she is inviting the couple to come. We will make the screen brighter. The dead girl probably wanted the couple to find out her body. We further verify the video We pick up the voices the couple has heard. It seems there could be a meaning. Da... Da...? Dy... Dy...? Daddy... Daddy...? Hel... Hel...? When we connect them together... Daddy, hel... We turn up the volume Daddy, hel...? Daddy, hel... There was another point that we notice in this video By the time when the couple found the body and ran away Oh, no. The police! We turn up the volume here help... help... help Is this a scream of a dead girl who was asking for help? Our crew did search around the scene where the body was found. We found that many children are missing and murdered around this area. We have no idea whether this case is relevant to these incidents. But it is notable that the incidents were occurring even after the father of the dead girl passed away. "Daddy, help" The scream of the dead girl... Was she trying to escape from her father who abused her? or Was she asking for her father to help her being attacked by someone? Maybe she was asking her father for help when someone tried to kill her. The father of a girl killed himself during the investigation. Could he be innocent for killing his own child? Do you know the following fact? The entity follows you if you shoot it. The passerby This video was taken when the video holder went for fishing with his colleagues. The video recorded few young people having fun and eating BBQ at riverside. But later, on the way home, they were involved in the car accident. Because the car brake did not work properly. None of them are dead but two of them were seriously injured to be hospitalized. Before this, when they stopped at fishing tackle shop, they say that the video recorded someone strange. Dip it and take it! Cheers! Please watch the following part of the video. No, no! Bento! Gross! We partly change the pitch of the voice in order to protect music right. A strange transparent woman is recorded three times. She gradually becomes more visible. Through the rear window of the car, at the door window, and at the passengers seat, you could see this woman. A woman who wears black. They are sure that she was not there when the video was taken. And none of them know this woman. Did they let the entity inside the car to take them with her? Was that the accident was all about? Video holder: Kouta Takagi Few years ago, I was helping a jack-of-all-trades. Normally we do cleanings and maintenance of the houses. Then, one day, we were asked to visit the grave. Sometimes we are asked to do that when the graveyard is too far to go . We go instead to clean the place and to give some flowers. This is the video of one of those times. Visiting grave -Are you recording? -Yes, I am. -Ok, you record everything. -Yes. -Ok, let's go. -You have to record the time. Now it's 1:12. I'll go and visit the grave from now. The grave was located in the mountains. We left in the morning and reached there in the evening. And I was the one to record it. The client strangely asked the video holder to record everything on the video. Usually, after we clean the place, we take a picture to show how it looks. But it is rare that we take a video of the whole process. Never done that before. And that client asked us to visit grave 2:00 in the morning. The client told us never stop recording. Strange requests. On the way in the car, I was talking with my boss that it was strange, but this job was paid well. Boss, you are going too fast. It is quite hard walking with video shooting. Is there any grave around here? -Hey, you're recording now. -Excuse me. We are on the right way as the map shows. Are you sure there is a grave in such a place? -Ouch. -We are shooting! Excuse me. We go this way. Ok. -What is it? -I stepped on something. Come on, hurry. They went further up in the mountains. This is it. Is it? We can finish it pretty soon. It is so strange. Spooky isn't it? -Ouch! -This is the request of the client. People have different ways of praying. -Remember we're recording it! -Excuse me. Now it's time. 2:00 am in the morning. It'll soon be at 2:00 in the morning. I start praying from now. Boss started praying according to the memo of the client. There is one sickle at every corner. Cut the rope with the sickle. Repeat to do the same. *We edit the in-between. Stick four sickles on the ground to make a square. Pour sake into the cup in front of the grave. And drink it all. Chant a mantra. And pray. He finished praying. Stray dogs? Sorry, boss. The light is out. Boss? Yours is also out? Boss? Boss! Boss! Video was then taken with infrared camera mode. Boss...what are you doing? The noise started to appear on the screen. Boss, what are you doing? Boss? Boss! Boss! Where are you going? Wait please! Boss! Boss...be careful! It was strange that the lights were gone at the same time. So I got scared... I brought my camera with me. Then I remembered it had an infrared camera mode. That's what I recorded. After that I was not even looking for my boss. I came running towards the car somehow... with the light from the camera in the darkness. On the way back to the car, I got lost and it took quite a while to be back there. I was totally in a panic, I even forgot to turn off the camera. Boss? Boss! Boss! Boss. He tried to take out the cellphone... The video holder left the camera and ran away. But the camera recorded everything until the very end. Video holder: Kouta Takagi In order to call the ambulance, he tried to catch the signal. His boss: Yoshiyasu Hirano (fictitious name) His boss Mr. Hirano was carried to the hospital, but he was already dead. The police ruled out foul play about his death according to the autopsy. The cause of his death was Dyspnea. There was no scars or no trace of being murdered. After his death, what happened to the company? His company doesn't exist anymore. And the tape... I gave it to his wife. But I was worried and I copied the data before I gave it to her. And there are some strange points. The map and memo which my boss had... We couldn't find them. The police looked for where the grave was... They couldn't find the grave. The locals didn't even know about the grave. About the client... when we checked... we found out that all the informations about the client were false. We couldn't find out who that was. The police ruled out foul play. They did not go for further investigations. One of the party is suspiciously dead. Any relations with inexplicable heads? In order to find out about the grave and the way how his boss prayed, we requested the opinion of the expert. The expert: Assistant professor Well, I saw the video. And I have never seen this case before. It has a stupa, so this surely is a grave. I noticed that the grave was surrounded by ropes... so, this could have been some sort of a ceremony. For instance, there is a ceremony using sickles. Partly cult of Suwa. It is a pray for the huge harvest. *Cult of Suwa The cult that worships Suwa Shrine in Nagano prefecture. It can be said that it's a sort of an curse magic. So the pray that we see in this case in video... I'm not sure what the intention was... It could have been a sort of ceremony rather than just visiting grave. That was the impression I got. We got interesting informations from a person we know. Ex production manager of famous horror videos: Hajime Izuki I happened to interview the shaman. He said that ... there is a place where you can curse a person by doing a certain thing at a certain place. You might have heard about it as well. For example, if you whisper the name of God at a ruined Shrine... you will be cursed to death. This is true. So if you wish a person to be dead, you take him there to curse him to death. This is an actual practice. But it is hard to do, because normally such a place... is far to go and to take him there is a hard thing to do. So it's actually difficult. And we... reach to a conclusion. The client's intention was to make him do the things to curse himself. The reason why the client asked him to record everything was to make sure that he does the ceremony. There is no evidence that he is murdered. But the client must have made him curse to death. The conclusion we reached may be right. There is a suspicious person recorded on the tape. This is part of the video when the video holder runs away to call ambulance. He put his camera on the bonnet of the car and left. The camera caught the passenger's seat through the front glass. Fast-forwarding Few minutes later The image is rough, but surely someone is there. Please watch as we make it brighter. The map and memo which Mr. Hirano had... must have been taken away by this person. Could this person who looks inside the car be the client who cursed Mr. Hirano to death? Video holder: Kouta Takagi We sent him the mail of what we think. Then, he gave us a quick response. On the day we went to visit grave... now I have some thoughts in my mind. Some thoughts? Just before we go, Boss's wife came out to see us off. She looked quite happy that time. Boss also said in the car that she looked happy. What about it? Yes. Normally, she helped my boss. And well... But my boss always yelled at her or hit her in the head. Or even kicked her. I worked there for about a year or so but she's always sorrowful, I have never seen her smiling. So she was not how she was normally. No. The curse ceremony under the disguise of visiting grave... What does his wife have to do with it? Do you know how to keep in touch with her? I don't know... After this, it seems that she moved out. Where she is now, I don't know. I heard that she bought an apartment close to where her parents live. Mrs. Hirano was a beneficiary of huge amount of life insurance. If Mr. Hirano was cursed to death,the client could have been someone just close to him. At present, there are many agencies that undertake curse magic to curse someone. Service for curse Present law of Japan does not punish the murder done by curse magic Go game The video of playing Go game. This video was taken by his father 15 years ago when a video holder went to visit his grand father. According to him, it was during the summer holiday. Recently, he converted the home videos to DVD. Then he found out an inexplicable existence in the video. Please watch the part of the video in question. The white face appeared from the wall and then disappeared Please watch this again. All of them who were there at that time are dead except for the video holder. His grand father, his father, and his sister are dead now Moreover, this house was burnt down by suspicious fire few years later. At an apartment few decades ago the video was found out during the cleaning Video holder: ex-president of a cleaning company Many Yakuzas lived in that apartment. Close to the dangerous area. The apartment with backstreet people. By the time they rent the place, they say they are clean office workers. I found the video there. The first time I watched it, I was shocked. We also do some related works... so we knew this kind of thing exists. Honestly speaking, I felt really bad. Revenge Are you alright with it? Do you agree? Do you agree? You are not young already. No red lights. With a baby, no. Your parents? Any siblings? This is no joke. This is no joke. Are you listening? Ok, I'll do. Ok, you tell the camera that you'll do. I'll do. The pregnant woman owe some debts... and was forced to do something Ok, do it. I give you something nice. Let her drink it. Drink it. Drink it, I said. Two men let the woman have some tablets forcibly. Okey. Now she wears white Kimono. Are you scared? I'll do it. May I practice? Sure, go ahead. Cutting at a stroke? Yeah. Is it because of the tablet she had? She acts different than before. Where should I cut? Could be anywhere in the middle. Stick the knife and slide it to the side. Slide it... To the side. Right. Right. Ok, do it. Should I put it? Ok, well... When I say go, you do it after you count 10 seconds. -You open the front. -Do I open it? Right. The image you will see next moment might give you a serious impact to your mind and body. If you are unwilling to see, please stop playing or please start watching from the next chapter. We do not bear any responsibilities. Ok, go. I do it. Wait, open the front! Open the front of your Kimono, I told you! What should we do? Do it again! What are you doing? The woman attacked men. Cut. Cut. Cut what? Cut her stomach. Cut her stomach! Take out a baby. Take out a baby What will we do? What will we do? We take her to the bathroom. Hold her head. This won't work. We cut her into pieces at the bathroom. I take off my socks. Maybe... they were trying to sell this video to the fanatics. There are some demands for such videos. I don't know if it's true but... some wants the murder videos. On the internet... we found some Harakiri videos. But... they forced a pregnant woman to do it... They are monsters. Heaven will punish them. Since they did not stop the video, it shockingly continues. Please watch and turn up the volume. Two men carries the body of the woman. Shall I bring something to cut? And the camera? You take off your clothes. You take off your clothes. Why? We shoot the scene you are f*cking her. Are you sure? Just take off your clothes. What happened to the men in the bathroom? Was it a same room that you cleaned up and the one in the video? I think it's the same room where the video was taken and where the video was found. I can't really say it. This room was for a Yakuza executive. After he died, we went in for cleaning. Then the video holder showed us something strange. Before the cleaning, we always take some photos. And we took some photos of the bathroom. Take a look. Handprints... This is the photo. There are many handprints and footprints on the wall of the bathroom. He said that the size of them were very very small. The strange sound of crying at the end... Was that a scream of a baby who was killed even before he was born? And his grudge might still be there.
