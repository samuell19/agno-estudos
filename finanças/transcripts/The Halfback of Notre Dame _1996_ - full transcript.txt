CRAIG, IT'S FOOTBALL THAT'S GONNA GET YOU INTO A TOP UNIVERSITY, AND THEN WE'RE IN THE PROS. IF I HAD YOUR OPPORTUNITY, YOU THINK I'D BE STUCK HERE, COACHING-- ME. YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT. LET'S JUST FORGET ALL ABOUT THE PIANO BUSINESS, OKAY? I'VE SEEN WHAT IT'S DONE TO YOUR GAME. IT'S DISTRACTING YOU. NOW, LISTEN-- YOU KEEP UP YOUR GRADES. THAT'S IMPORTANT. BUT OUTSIDE OF CLASS, THE TEAM IS EATING, DRINKING, SLEEPING FOOTBALL, 'CAUSE THE CITY CHAMPIONSHIP IS JUST FIVE WEEKS AWAY. HMM?

NEVER MIND. ( playing ) CRAIG, YOU DON'T LOOK WELL. I'LL GET IT. SORRY, I JUST--SORRY. ( playing slowly ) CRAIG. DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT WITH ME TOMORROW NIGHT? OHH, MAN. I CAN'T BELIEVE I SAID THAT. UH, THAT WAS A JOKE. I--I WAS JOKING. I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE FUNNY. CRAIG, YOU JUST ASKED ME OUT. NOT REALLY. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU FELT THAT WAY ABOUT ME. UH, LOOK, I'M SORRY. I JUST-- ( laughs ) I WAS JUST-- LET'S JUST DO THIS. NO. YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY--THAT I NEVER THOUGHT OF YOU THAT WAY. CRAIG. DAD. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? NO, NO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? NOTHING. I WAS HOPING ARCHIE WAS WRONG ABOUT THIS. DAD, I NEVER SAID I WASN'T GONNA PLAY PIANO. CRAIG, YOU ARE TOSSING YOUR SCHOLARSHIP DOWN THE DRAIN. MR. MODEAU, HOW COULD A LITTLE PIANO AFFECT HIS FOOTBALL? I GUESS YOU WEREN'T AT THE LAST SCRIMMAGE. YOU'VE TURNED MY MARCUS ALLEN INTO A LIBERACE. AND LIBERACE CAN'T BLOCK. DAD, LOOK, IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH HER. SHE'S JUST HELPING ME. NOT ANY MORE. FROM NOW, YOU HAVE LUNCH IN MY OFFICE, YOU GO TO PRACTICE RIGHT AFTER CLASS, AND THEN STRAIGHT HOME WITH ME. DAD-- THAT'S IT! GET YOUR STUFF! MR. MODEAU, YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE. I'LL THANK YOU TO STAY OUT OF OUR FAMILY BUSINESS. COME ON, LET'S GO. CRAIG, I'M SORRY. I TRUST YOU'RE ALL PREPARED FOR THE EXAM TOMORROW. YOUR SCORE WILL CONSTITUTE 50% OF YOUR GRADE. YOU BETTER WRITE THIS DOWN. I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TAKE THE TEST FOR YOU. JUST RELAX. I'M GONNA ACE IT. I'M GONNA WATCH YOU EAT, I'M GONNA WATCH YOU SLEEP, BECAUSE WE ARE GONNA WIN THIS THING. DIG IN. ( school bell rings ) ALL RIGHT, TIME'S UP. LET'S HAND THEM IN, PLEASE. COME ON. TOUGH TEST. LOW-FIVE ME. I NAILED IT, BABY. HA HA HA! YOU WANT A FEW MORE? NO. I GOTTA GO. GO WHERE? TO THE LIBRARY. WHAT FOR? I GOTTA RESEARCH A PAPER FOR ENGLISH. CHAMPIONSHIP GAME IS IN TWO DAYS--YOU SHOULD BE BONING UP ON YOUR PLAYS. I'LL DO THAT IN THE LIBRARY. YOU CAN DO THAT HERE. WILL YOU GET SERIOUS? THE GEORGIA TECH SCOUT IS GONNA BE THERE. I WANT LIGHTS OUT BY 10:00. I WANT YOU TO GET YOUR EIGHT. I'LL GET MY EIGHT, DAD! THE WORLD WOULD COME TO AN END IF I DIDN'T GET MY EIGHT! I MIGHT LOST FOCUS, ISN'T THAT RIGHT, DAD? WOULDN'T WANT ME TO LOSE FOCUS! 'CAUSE WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS TO PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE! BUT MY ENTIRE LIFE IS FOOTBALL, FOOTBALL, FOOTBALL! CRAIG, I AM NOT GONNA LET YOU BLOW OUR SHOT AT THE PROS! OUR SHOT?! I THOUGHT THAT IS WHAT YOU WANTED. DAD...I QUIT. I QUIT. I QUIT. CRAIG, WAIT FOR ME. UH, LISTEN, YOU SHOULD JUST GO BACK. WHAT HAPPENED? YOU LOOK HORRIBLE. I FEEL HORRIBLE. BUT, UH, I SHOULD BE FEELING GREAT. I JUST QUIT THE TEAM. YOU QUIT THE TEAM? BUT ISN'T THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME THIS WEEK? IS THAT ALL ANYONE THINKS ABOUT AROUND HERE? I THOUGHT YOU'D BE GLAD. BUT YOU LIKE FOOTBALL, DON'T YOU? YEAH. IT'S FUNNY, YOU KNOW? I FEEL LIKE-- I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN PLAYING FOOTBALL EVER SINCE I COULD WALK. BUT IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME UNTIL TONIGHT WHETHER I ACTUALLY LIKED IT OR NOT. CRAIG, HOW COULD YOU DO SOMETHING FOR SO LONG AND NOT KNOW HOW YOU FELT ABOUT IT? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST ALWAYS BEEN WHAT I DID. I'M THROUGH WITH FOOTBALL. WHY? BECAUSE I'M ONLY GONNA DO WHAT I WANT TO DO. YOU KNOW? LIKE PLAY PIANO. I MEAN, WHO KNOWS? IF MY MOTHER WAS ALIVE, MAYBE I WOULD'VE BEEN PLAYING ALL THESE YEARS. CRAIG, IF YOU WANT TO GIVE UP FOOTBALL, YOU SHOULD. BUT DON'T QUIT THE TEAM FOR THE WRONG REASONS. OHH, MY DAD'S GIVEN ME A MILLION REASONS. YOU SHOULDN'T LET ANYONE STOP YOU FROM PLAYING EITHER THE PIANO OR FOOTBALL. Boy: ALL RIGHT! Second boy: HOW'D YOU DO? FATHER O'MALLEY, I DIDN'T GET MY TEST. MISS DE TOQUEVILLE AND MR. SHAUGNESSY... I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU BOTH BACK HERE AFTER LUNCH, PLEASE. WHAT'S GOING ON? LISTEN, YOU GOTTA BACK ME UP ON THIS, OKAY? WE ALL SAW ESMERELDA CHEATING ON THE TEST. HER CHEATING? WHAT ABOUT YOU? LISTEN-- CAN I HELP YOU? DO YOU WANT ME TO GET KICKED OFF THE TEAM? WE'LL LOSE THE CHAMPIONSHIP. YOU SAW HER CHEATING. FATHER O'MALLEY'S NEVER GONNA BELIEVE US. SHE IS ALWAYS GETTING As. HE'LL BELIEVE YOU. WE SAW HER CHEATING, RIGHT? SURE. YEAH. THANK YOU. YOU WERE THE ONLY TWO STUDENTS WHO HAVE EVER SCORED 100% ON THIS FINAL EXAM. AND AFTER THE TEST, I FOUND THIS LYING ON THE FLOOR BETWEEN YOUR DESKS. THESE NOTES HAVE CLEARLY BEEN COPIED FROM THE TEACHERS EDITION. YOU BOTH KNOW THE PUNISHMENT FOR CHEATING. HOWEVER, IF THE GUILTY PARTY WERE TO CONFESS NOW, I MIGHT BE INCLINED TO RECOMMEND LENIENCY. WELL, MISS DE TOQUEVILLE HAS CLEARLY BEEN THE MORE CONSCIENTIOUS STUDENT, SO I'M INCLINED TO ASSUME THAT IT'S YOU, MR. SHAUGNESSY. WAIT A MINUTE. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. I'M LEFT WITH NO OTHER CHOICE. I'M SORRY. I'M GONNA HAVE TO TELL FATHER O'MALLEY THE TRUTH. WHAT? SHE WAS CHEATING, FATHER. WHAT?! ALL SEMESTER. I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING, BUT-- ARCHIE, HOW COULD YOU? I'M SORRY, BUT YOU'RE ONLY CHEATING YOURSELF BY CHEATING. IS THIS TRUE, MISS DE TOQUEVILLE? NO, IT IS NOT. WE DIDN'T MEAN TO BUTT IN, FATHER O'MALLEY, BUT WE FELT WE HAD TO TELL YOU WHAT WE SAW. MISS VOSSLER, MISS SHANNON, ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU SAW MISS DE TOQUEVILLE CHEATING? WE'RE SORRY TO SAY... Both: WE DID. I SEE. I'VE NEVER CHEATED IN MY LIFE. INDEED. IN FACT, I FIND IT CURIOUS THAT YOU THREE WOULD BE PAYING SO MUCH ATTENTION TO MISS DE TOQUEVILLE DURING THE EXAMINATION. I DON'T HAVE THAT TEACHERS EDITION. I'M INNOCENT, FATHER. WELL, YOU COULD VERY WELL HAVE IT AT HOME. WHAT ABOUT HER LOCKER? MISS DE TOQUEVILLE, DO YOU MIND? ABSOLUMENT. I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE. MISS DE TOQUEVILLE... FOLLOW ME TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, PLEASE. FATHER! STAY BACK, PLEASE. STAY BACK. YOU'RE DOING GOOD. ( playing notes ) ( singing notes ) ( playing Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star ) GOOD, GOOD. THAT'S RIGHT. PLAY THAT ONE AGAIN. ( playing ) ( singing ) VERY GOOD, CRAIG. VERY GOOD. LOOK AT DAD. HI. ( playing Debussy's Clair de Lune ) ( chair clacks ) ESMERELDA-- IT'S ME. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I HAD NO IDEA. YOU'RE GOOD. YOU ARE REAL GOOD. YOU'VE GOT YOUR MOTHER'S TALENT. BOY, SHE'D BE PROUD OF YOU. WELL, I GUESS I CAN SAY NO PIANO PLAYER CAN HIT THE DEFENSIVE LINE LIKE MY SON. I'M PROUD OF YOU. NO, I--I-- I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME LATER. OKAY. MISS DE TOQUEVILLE, YOU SAY THAT MR. SHAUGNESSY BROKE INTO YOUR LOCKER BEFORE. WHY DIDN'T YOU REPORT IT? I DIDN'T THINK THAT-- I REGRET THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE COURSE OF ACTION THAT I MUST TAKE. I CAN'T PROVE IT, BUT IT WAS ARCHIE, NOT ME. MR. SHAUGNESSY COMES FROM A GOOD FAMILY. NOTRE DAME HAS UPHELD ITS STRICT TRADITION FOR 50 YEARS. ( sighs ) WE WILL MISS YOU.

WE DON'T NEED HIM TO WIN THIS. AND NOW LET'S GIVE A GREAT BIG CHEER FOR OUR VERY OWN STAR QUARTERBACK... ARCHIE SHAUGNESSY! ( cheering ) NOTRE DAME, I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR YOU. ARE WE GONNA CENTRAL'S BUTT OR WHAT?! ( cheering ) ( whistle blows, cheering ) BALL! ( cheering ) ALL RIGHT, GET IN THERE, OFFENSE! ESMERELDA? ( whistle blows ) CRAZY...I'M SO SORRY. ESMERELDA?
