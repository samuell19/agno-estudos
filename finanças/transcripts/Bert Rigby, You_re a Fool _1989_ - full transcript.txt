[instrumental music] [whistling] [sighs] How's it going, buddy? How's it going? [music continues] You got two hours? - Bartender. - Yo! A bottle of Theakston's Old Peculiar for my friend here, please. Keep the change. No, no, no. No, I'll keep the change. I keep forgetting. I'm almost broke. Huh. You know what this is? It's a contract. A $100,000 contract. Made out to Bert Rigby. That's me. 'Bert Rigby.' You know why I keep this? In case I run out of toilet paper. You ever drunk Theakston's Old Peculiar before? No. You're in for a treat, sunshine. 'That is the best beer' in the whole bloody world. Bartender! [male #1] 'Yo!' Two more Old Peculiars, please. Two more weirdies coming up. What were we talkin' about? [chuckles] Oh, my life. My life is a bloody joke. No, it's not a bloody joke, it's a bloody movie. That's what it is. And it's entitled.. "...Bert Rigby, You're A Fool." Now, I know it won't come as a surprise to you but I'm not from around here. I come from a place called Langmore. It's a cozy little town in the north of England. I work in a colliery. Oh! A coal mine. Aye, I dig for coal. Well, except on Fridays when the Langmore colliery band rehearses. Then I used to sing and dance for the lads and they'd love it.

[no audio] And she just happened to own.. ...a family pub, bless her. Hello! [indistinct chatter on TV] Hiya, blue eyes. Nothin' any good on the television anymore. Well...there will be. Here. Gene Kelly! Oh, it's me favorite! Thanks, love. You're a good son, Bert Rigby. Hey, Aunt Aggie I bought you a bag of sugared almonds. Oh! [indistinct mumbling] [laughs] You'll like this. This is one of me favorites, this is. [music on TV] Those old movies were a godsend. They kept me mum busy and gave me some quiet time in the bomb shelter.. ...with me girl. ♪ Singing in the rain ♪ ♪ Just singing in the rain ♪♪ They climb up their wall lights around. - It's lovely. - Mm! You see, during the war our fathers had built a common bomb shelter between the two houses. Me mum wouldn't let it be torn down. She told everybody I was conceived in it and one day, they want to put a plaque on it. [whistling] [instrumental music] [door creaks] Oh, God, I missed you. Why? Was there trouble at work? No. And you know why? Music. There's been in a band who played in the pits all day. I've been singin' and dancin'. I'll tell you what, and I've cheered the lads up. How's your day goin'? Well, uh, I made a lovely lamb stew. With new potatoes and carrots and, and dumplings. Oh, I wish we could eat it together. This is daft! Let's get married. What? And have your mother commit suicide? No, thank you. I don't need that on me conscience. Now it wasn't that mother hated Laurel. Mother hated Laurel's mother Mrs. Pennington. Until my father's death they'd been best of friends.. ...sharing everything. Which, unbeknownst to my mother included my father. It seems that when Mr. Pennington died in service my father felt it was his patriotic duty to console Mrs. Pennington. Which he did.. ...on six different occasions. "James Alfred Rigby.. ...may you rest in peace." [bawling] - Alfie! Alfie! - Don't, mother! Oh, I love you, Alfie, I love you! - Ah? - We all did. Everybody loved dad. - And he loved me! - Mother! He had a lot of love in him. She doesn't know what she's saying. He loved me! He said he loved me! You what? I'll kill her! - I'll kill her! She's a liar! - Mum. What? You, are you calling me a liar? Hey! Hey! Hey! Now stop that, stop it, the pair of ya! [all clamoring] [indistinct chatter] Thank God Laurel's mother refused to set foot in the family pub if I was there. The pub and the bomb shelter were two important places in our lives. The pub was an important place in everybody's life. Especially with the threat of a strike in the air. [Bert] 'Laurel!' Last warning, four pints, right now. Or we're takin' our business elsewhere. Four pints, comin' up. Here you are, darlin', there's a couple of complimentary tickets. And they, uh, compliment you on your lovely complexion. Be there or be square. Stick up the poster up there where people can see it. - Right. - See ya. It's a free ticket to paradise, darling. Come backstage after the show. Hey, who was the fine figure of a wally with a cigar? Oh, the was Sid Trample. Yeah, that joker that runs the talent show? In person. Gave me two free tickets if I stick this up. - What's that? - "Sunday, one night only. '"Sid Trampel's Old Time' original traveling amateur contest." Old time? That's for you, Bert. No, the 100 pounds in prizes, that's for me. Oh, not your tribute to Buster Keaton again. Boring. No, I might do a nice Gene Kelly number. Hey, do your Fred Astaire. - I like that. - Yeah? Why don't you learn to do Bruce Springsteen or Michael Jackson? - Or Whitney Houston. - Or The Muppets. [indistinct chatter] Or a Sunday, in the afternoon we all play football and at night, Laurel, I play The Ritz. [instrumental music] The football game that afternoon was quite interesting. The first half was a classic contest. Two equally matched teams played hard and attempted to kick the ball towards the opponent's goal. [all cheering] Now, during half-time we'd heard that the Brookship players had vaulted down the strike and were planning to hire on a scabs. Well, the second half took on a bit more spirit. The focus turned from kicking the football to kicking your opponent's balls. [groaning] And the fans, well, they seemed to have been caught up in it. [clamoring] Things were getting quite emotional.

[audience cheering] [instrumental music] [raucous cheering] [Bert] I'd never performed on a real stage before with a real orchestra playing and I couldn't believe I heard Sid Trample right. You heard right. You'll be my regular permanent amateur and travel with my company. And you'll pay me a hundred quid every night if I win? - Fifty. - No, no, no. No, no, no. You-you just gave me a hundred. Yeah, that's 'cause you beat my regular permanent amateur. He would normally get his 50 pounds cut. That's why I'm having to let him go. Every time he loses, it cost me my 50 quid. - What if I lose? - It won't happen, son. Not if you do what you did tonight. - I can't bleed every night. - Could be arranged. Now look, fake it, fake it. Public love blood. So, if I lose, I don't get paid, right? - You're a winner. - Yeah, that's what he told me. And I was right, you got 30 weeks. Look, about my bus fare, I think-- Listen, Mounten, this is a private conversation. - Now, piss off. - Bastard. Now look, I always treat people decent, huh? And I'm telling you that you could be the greatest all-time, permanent amateur in history. The all-time greatest, permanent amateur? Is that what you want to be? Well, I don't want to be a striking out-of-work coal miner. And I sure as hell won't be a scab. You're going to leave me, aren't you? I'm not leaving you. I'm leaving this town. - Same thing. - It's not the same thing. You're beautiful and alive. - This town is-- - What? Oh, have you looked at it lately? I pointed out to Laurel that the town was ugly and dying a very slow death. One by one, shops were closing and people were moving out. Our one cinema was opened only on Thursdays and not to show films. The garden gates, number eight. Both ones, legs eleven. Legs eleven, number eleven. Oh, it hurt to hear that coming from the stage. The very stage where I'd seen those great old movies with Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Humphrey Bogart Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald. The Ritz Theatre was like our church. When I was a kid, me mum would take me there every Friday night. She loved those old musicals. [instrumental music] [Bert slurping] Bert, suck quietly. [slurping continues] If you can't suck quietly, suck in rhythm. [music continues] I also reminded Laurel that not only was our theatre shot but with the strike on, so was our mines. Life in Langmore was not a cabaret, old chum. Unless somebody does something, this town is dead. Well, running off with an amateur show won't bring the town back to life. But it'll bring me back to life and with this stuff I can bring back the most important part of town. Are you talking about the Ritz Theatre? Yes, I am. Laurel, I am going to win enough money to turn The Ritz into a palace. - What if you lose? - Lose? Lose? That's the problem right there. That's why this town is dying. We've been losing for so long, we've come to accept it. Well, look, I may get another bloody nose but by God, I've got to give it a try. Well, how long will this try take? However long it takes to get rich. Rich? By playing in an amateur show? Charlie Chaplin started out as an amateur. - Every great star did. - Charlie Chaplin? Oh, Bert, you're livin' in the past. Laurel, did you hear those people applauding out there tonight? Well, yes, I was one of the main applauders. Bert, your friends were there. I know that, but I was watching the people who didn't know me, they were cheering. Laurel, something happened to me out there tonight. It was like a, like a bomb went off inside me. Remember that night we saw Gene Kelly on the telly in "Singin' In The Rain?" 'And afterwards I did the whole show for you meself.' You were cheering then. Remember?

Hey, did you stop? You're being childish. I'm not being childish. And why are you behaving this way? 'Cause I'm afraid. Of what? That I'll become a big star and run off with Meryl Streep? Oh, come on. That won't happen. I love you, I want to be a success for you. Oh, I'm not afraid you'll succeed. Then what are you afraid of? That you might fail. I know you, Bert. If you fail, you'll never come back. That's why I won't fail. Anything else you're afraid of? Yeah. You'll be in strange towns with strange ladies who might find you attractive. Come on, girl, there isn't a woman in all the provinces that's got what you've got. Yeah, but what I've got will be here where you can't get at it. Or you can get on a bus and bring it to me. I'm doing this for us. [instrumental music] Laurel was wrong to worry about the strange ladies in little towns finding me attractive. She should've worried about the strange lady on the bus. Tess Trample, Sid's wife. Nobody likes my oysters. - Your what? - My smoked oysters. - Oh. - Would you like one, Mr. Rigby? No, I don't think so, Mrs. Trample. - Well, I-I've never had one. - Try one. Guaranteed to put lead in your pencil. Though I have a feeling your pencil's fully leaded. Oh.. Let the smoky flavor mingle with your spit. [gulps] Now, doesn't that make you want to fuck? [screams softly] Mrs. Trample, please. I'm sorry, Bert. May I call you Bert? I think you know me well enough. You're a very sensual man, Bert. Oh, you can tell that from one grab? Yes, and from the way you move on stage. Ah, that's very nice. [giggles] - Mrs. Trample, please. - Call me Tess. But your husband is driving the bus. He can't see us, I checked his rearview mirror. Ow! How...long is it before we get to Wilkiston? Not long enough to diddle my wife. Tess, get your ass back up here! Sidney, you're being vulgar again and I will not tolerate it! Get your ass back up here! - Make me. - Right. [tires screeching] Sidney! What kept you? A nympho and a schizo. Their marriage was a perfect blend of sex and violence. [instrumental music] Traveling with the Tramples was quite educational. I got to see parts of the country I'd always wanted to see. And Mrs. Trample kept showing me parts of her I had no interest in seeing. I was starting to feel like a real professional amateur. Every night, a new town and another 50 quid. My bank roll was starting to bulge. Me only expense were long distance phone calls to Laurel and a couple of bottles of ketchup. Sid was right. People love blood. [Bert] 'Laurel, I've won again!' Oh, have you got enough money to buy the Ritz yet? Well, no, not quite, but I'm on me way, love. 'Ey, guess what? I signed me first autograph tonight. 'She told me I was fantastic.' - She? - 'Yeah.' What else did she tell you? She said she was eleven years old and you shouldn't be jealous. I'm sorry. Ha-have you met any other exciting people? 'Well, no strange ladies, if that's what you mean.' 'What's Mrs. Trample like?' Mrs. Trample? Oh, she's, um.. ...very motherly. 'She's really nice to all the lads.' 'Very giving.' 'And the thing is though' she's really devoted to her husband. Cover up your tits and get your ass back to the bedroom. I was just bringing Bert some smoked oysters. Out. Sid, you're a selfish pig! And you do not know how to speak to a lady. It's just as well I didn't marry one then, isn't it? Shithead. Before she met me, she had no class at all. Bert, is there someone in your room? Oh, it's just Mr. and Mrs. Trample. They brought me some smoked oysters. Smoked oysters? 'I've grown quite fond of them.' I'll send you some. I-I'll ring you tomorrow, love. I love you. Bye. - Here's your money. - Yeah. Cheers, Sid. Hey, I-I'd like to talk to you about my act. I'm getting bored doing the same routine every night. Oh, yeah? Bored takin' my money every night, are ya? No! No.. I feel dishonest. Pretending to have a nose bleed. Listen. I'm gonna try out a new act tomorrow night. I'm gonna find out if they're voting for me out of sympathy or because I'm best. Yeah? Well, it's your decision. Remember, if you lose the contest I lose 50 quid, but you lose your job. Sleep well. Well, I didn't sleep well. Me mind was on me new act. A tribute to the silent movie stars. 'Ey, and talk about omens. On the way to the theater that day what do we run into but a real movie company. Oh, this is great. I've never seen a movie being made. [Bert] 'Hey, isn't that Michael Caine?' [Tess] 'Hm, probably. He's in everything.' I want to hear what they're saying. Bert.. Oye, don't move off. We're leavin' as soon as I finish this piss. Keep rollin'. Quiet! I'm pissin' as quiet as I can! I said, "Quiet!" Alright, Mr. Spielberg. [clattering] - Sorry. Sorry. - 'Action!' [male #3] 'Pull back.' 'Tender kiss.' 'Tender.' 'Okay, okay. Start actin'.' Are you frightened? Of love? No. [male #4] 'Do you trust me?' Very much, and what's equally important is.. ...we both trust Crown Royal Condoms. Crown Royal. Fit for kings. And commoners. Cut! No. No good. No print! Craig, do you know what it feels like to have an erection? - 'Ey? Yeah, of course. - Of course. Well, I wanna see that on camera. I wanna see passion! I wanna feel that erection. We are selling rubbers here, not hairspray! - 'Wrap it up.' - Okay, everybody. That's the wrap. 8 a.m. start tomorrow. This Shakespeare shit is not working. I didn't know it at the time but the director of that Crown Royal Condom commercial was going to change my life.

[music continues] [laughs] [indistinct chatter] Don't I even get my bus fare home? No, you do not! Third place don't get bus fare! - I was second! - No, you weren't. Second was the bloke what ate the bicycle. Oye! Don't eat anything tonight. You're on again tomorrow. [coughing] Why are you such a cheap bastard? I don't know. You'd have to ask my mum about that. I found out later he was not only a cheap bastard but a conniving one. You Sid Trample? Maybe I am, maybe not. Where can I find Bert Rigby? Oh, what's he done? Listen, I'm in no way responsible-- No, look, look, look. Mr. Trample! I'm a film-maker! I want to use him in a commercial I'm shooting next week in California. Um...I-I'm not sure that I can release him right now. I'm his manager. I thought Mr. Rigby was an amateur. Um...he was. But I signed him to a contract this morning. It seems we both recognize his potential. You want to be my manager? Yeah. Sign the paper and we're in business. Ha! You just fired me! I didn't fire you. You just lost the amateur contest. Well then, why don't you manage Landed Gentry or the bloke who ate his bicycle? Because they are goin' nowhere. Oh, yeah? Where am I goin' then? You are going to the United States of America. What for? "What for?" To work! I've got contacts there. I don't believe you. Contacts and contracts! Hey, that's made out to me. That's right. One thousand dollars for the test commercial plus a guaranteed $100,000 if you make a series of 'em. One hundred th.. Ah, t-th-that's a hun.. Um.. [claps] I'll sign it then! Unfortunately.. ...you can't sign this unless you sign...that! I can't give you the job unless you're a client. Uh-huh. So, I signed on with Sid. Oh, I knew he was a conniver. But I thought he might as well do a little conniving for me. You're goin' to California by train? No, I'm at the train station catchin' a bus to the airport so I can fly to California. Laurel, we're flyin' first class! Bert. You're not involved in drugs a-and like, smuggling, are you? Me, smuggle drugs? Oh, come on! I'd think about that. - Damn risky. - Sid, please! How could you think that? Well, what should I think? You're flyin' to California first class with a slime. You mention fortunes of money for doin' something you can't quite explain. Well, drug smuggling is a very logical conclusion. Look, the reason I can't explain is they have a-- What sort of drugs are we talking about? Sid, please! T-they haven't made it clear. They want me to go to California to do a jogging shoe commercial as Charlie Chaplin! Why didn't you say so? Because you were too busy talkin' about drugs. Are we talkin' heavy drugs? Shut up, Sid! You didn't give me a chance. I'm sorry. [clicks tongue] Oh Bert, I'll miss you so much. Do you miss me? Yeah, of course I miss you. Well, you're gonna miss your plane, lover boy! Come on, Bert! It didn't sound like you meant it. 'Course I meant it! Come on, Bert! Look, Laurel, I gotta go. I'm gonna miss this plane. Is that it? Is that what? Well, I don't know. You're going far away. 'Before you put the phone on the hook' I'd just like to hear you say somethin' romantic. Oh, shit! "Shit?" I've lost me bags! Somebody sto.. I've hung up on Laurel. - Laurel? - I've got your bags! She'll understand. Come on! Flying first class was the first first class thing I'd ever done. And it was something I could get used to. But what I couldn't get used to was me manager. For the wife. She's crazy about these toasted almonds. She can't get 'em in the stores. Hey! What's this? For the wife. - Tamp bag? - Ssh! Don't use words like that in first class. Oh, you using that little pillow? Not right now. I say, stewardess! Could we have a pillow for my chum, please? Yes, sir. [airplane droning] The second first class thing I did was to stay at a ritzy Beverly Hills hotel. [Bert] 'Ah!' I've bloody died and gone to bloody heaven. Yeah, if this smog keeps up we're all gonna bloody die. Here's the air conditioner control. Here's a fully stocked bar. You have 24 hour valet and room service. Oh, well, uh, I-I-I wouldn't know what to do with a valet, personally. [laughs] Whoa! And, uh, this room doesn't look like it needs servicing, thank you. Bert? You in here, Berty? You know, Sid. Much as I love working in the coal mine.. ...I could give it all up for this. [Sid] 'No more mining for you, champ.' Here, I, uh, I got you a little present. Electric shaver. German. State-of-the-art. Eh, that's really nice of you, Sid. Don't mention it. Here. Get outta here and get your clothes on. 'Mr. DeForest's expecting us in half an hour.' But I put a call through to me girl. They said they'd ring me in half an hour. That was about-- Half an hour! Perfect! - Hello, Laurel? - Bert? [Bert on phone] 'Hey, hello, darlin'.' Now, I know it's late at night for you, um.. What time is it there? Well, I don't know. It's dark. Hey, anyway, why did you say "shit" and hang up on me this mornin'? Eh.. Oh, shit! Bert, I don't find that a bit funny. [crying] Oh! Ber-- [phone slamming] You bastard! I think I broke me coccyx. You can't have. You landed on your arse. That's me tailbone, ya punny! Well, you don't need that. That's alright. Here, you've gotta be dressed in three minutes. I've got to call me girl back. You do not have time to talk to your girl. I won't have a girl to talk to if I don't make time! You can't keep sayin "shit" and hangin' up on someone and expect to have a relationship! [phone rings] Come here. Hello? Oh, thank you. Hey, was that my girl? No...your limo! [engine rumbling] I couldn't believe I was riding around Beverly Hills in a limousine. That's the church Dudley Moore saw Bo Derek walk into in "10." [Bert] Bo Derek walked in there! Oh, Eddie Murphy used to ride up and down this street a lot in "Beverly Hills Cop" one and two. And that's the house he squatted in. [Sid] 'Oh, I love that Eddie Murphy.' 'You know, with the right management' 'he could do very well.' Sure, Sidney. I wouldn't mind handlin' him myself as a matter of fact. Oh, this street is the street Fred Astaire walked on. Hey! In what picture? [male #6] 'Oh, no picture.' 'When he was alive, he liked to walk.' 'I'd slow down just to watch him.' 'It's like watching a musical.' Hey, could we stop for a minute, please? [instrumental music] [music continues] [phone rings] Hello? Yes, sir. I'll put him on for you. Mr. Rigby. Laurel! Hey! How could she-- A Mr. DeForest. I'll put you on the speaker phone, sir. 'Go ahead.' [female #2] 'Mr. Rigby?' Hello? Who's talking? It's Mona Ridando. I'm Mr. DeForest's personal assistant. 'Would you please hold for Mr. DeForest?' [Bert on phone] 'Hold what?' Rigby, welcome to California. [DeForest on phone] 'Are they treating you right? Good.' Look, did anybody explain what we're going to do with you? I'm going to do Charlie Chaplin. [DeForest on phone] 'No.' You're gonna be doing Buster Keaton. Ah, I do Chaplin better. He does Chaplin better. Yeah well, so did the guy on the IBM commercial. And our legal department says we could be sued. Oh, well, we wouldn't want that to happen. Would we, sir? Keaton it will be! [DeForest] Alright, everybody. Settle down. - Come on. - 'Hurry up.' 'Help me.' Everybody out of the way. Get rid of.. Give him some room. Some room. Quiet, please. [bell ringing] - 'Quiet!' - 'Quiet, everyone!' Is the train ready? [train horn blaring] Action! [engine rumbling] [DeForest] 'Pull back.' I've run steadily for almost two days. And at night, I dreamt I was still running. [mumbling] [phone rings] [indistinct chatter] [panting] Hello? Hello, Bert. Oh, Laurel. Oh, it's great to hear your voice. Eh, guess what, love? You're going to say "shit" and hang up on me again? I knew you'd be angry. Well, why did you do it? [Bert on phone] 'I didn't do it. It just happened.' Anyway, listen, this commercial I'm doing they say if it tests well, they're going to do six of 'em straight away. Laurel. They're going to give this coal digger a hundred thousand dollars! Well, how long will it take? "How long will it take?" I just said "Hundred thousand dollars." And all you can say is, "How long will it take?" Well, how long will it? I don't believe this conversation. Well, it's a simple question. [Bert on phone] 'Simple is right.' Bert, I didn't call you to be insulted. I didn't insult you. And I called you! No, you didn't! I called you. I-I put a call in to you before I went to sleep. [Laurel on phone] 'Well, I didn't get it.' Well, reverse the charges! I'm payin' for this call! Well, that still doesn't give you the right to call me simple. [Bert on phone] 'I didn't call you simple.' 'I said the question was simple.' Well, why did you call me? To tell you about the deal. And.. ...not to expect me home for a little while. How long a while? There you go again. Laurel, I'm on my way to fame and fortune. Nobody can predict how long that takes and.. Why did you call me? Oh, I forget now. Laurel...are you alright? Oh, I'm fine. Hey, girl, as soon as I know what's what we'll set you up on a plane and come and visit me. Would you like that? [Bert on phone] 'Hey, you-you could help me' 'carry back the loot.' No, I don't think so. You don't think so? What kind of an answer is that? [Laurel on phone] 'What kind do you expect?' If someone had offered me a chance to visit me in America, I'd jump at it. Well, I don't feel like jumping right now, Bert. Laurel, are you sure you're alright? I'm fine! I asked her ten times what was wrong and all she could say was "I don't want to burden you with my little problem." I'm sure you've guessed what the little problem was. But dumb me. Oh, I didn't find out until weeks later. [instrumental music] [music continues] [male narrator] You've got the moves! We've got the shoes! [clapping] [laughs] Well.. ...that was very...professional. Wasn't too bad, was it? Did you see the spot? Yeah, I thought I did pretty well. And very nicely directed. Neither of us could've done better. That 30 second spot is as close to perfection as I'll ever get in my entire life! I'm damn proud of it! Damn proud! And you should be too. Here, Bert. You deserve this. [whistles] A thousand dollars. [DeForest] As contract. So.. ...when do we start shooting for the big money? Didn't they tell you? Tell us what? Are you kidding? No one told you? No. No one told us anythin'. Goddamn it! Why must I do all the dirty work? Jason! Jason, where the hell are you? [Jason on phone] 'I'm right here, sir.' Didn't I tell you to tell Mr. Rigby that the project is dead? - 'No.' - 'Well, then.' Who the hell did I tell? [Jason on phone] 'I don't know.' Well, for Christ sakes, call Mona tell her to find out and fire the bastard! [Jason on phone] 'Who's Mona?' - Well, a bitch! - 'What?' Okay. I'll be the villain. The project is dead. Hey...you.. You just said it was perfection. It is. But they tested it and they found out that nobody knew who Buster Keaton was. Nobody knew Buster Keaton? Nobody that matters! The kids! According to the demographics. What-what the bloody hell is demographics? Research. It showed that 94% of young people never even heard of Buster Keaton. I'm sick! All my work, all my dreams down the goddamn tubes! Go home! Go back to England. Put on a Beatles CD. Have a slice of kidney pie. And thank God you're out of show business! Buster Keaton and Bert Rigby. Two great careers shot down by demo-fucking-graphics. Go home.. ...a loser? - Huh! - Huh. - I couldn't face it. - Unh-huh. Thanks to Sid Trample I didn't have to face it. What do you mean we've got no transportation? Eh? They gave us two first class round trip tickets. - Didn't they? - One! Those cheap bastards wouldn't cough up for my ticket. I had to trade your round trip for two one-ways. You did what? No good manager would let his client come to this jungle of thieves without protection! Listen, the only thief I need protection from is you! "Thief?" I resent that! You don't deny it though, do you, hey? Where did you steal this silk suit from? Oh! That's the last straw. Without trust a contract is just a meaningless.. ...sheet of paper. And you can keep my share of that $1000, you ungrateful bastard! For a moment there, I felt bad. But five minutes later, I felt a lot worse. Is there anything wrong, sir? Nine hundred and twenty-three dollars? This can't be right! I wa-I was told the company was paying for the room and the food. Y-y-yes but not the overseas calls. "Overseas calls?" I only made two. Twenty-two. Twenty-two? And there's the pharmacy charges here. Pharmacy charges? An.. An electric razor? - Um...two. - Two electric razors. There's also a large haberdashery shop charge. Hab.. That's where he got the silk suit! That scumbag had left me stranded in the new world with $77 dollars. Heh! - Huh. - Huh. I should've been depressed, but for some reason I think it's because I'm an idiot I was exhilarated. I could hear Laurel's voice ringing in my ears. [Laurel] "I know you, Bert." "If you fail, you'll never come back." I said to meself, "Bert, you're not leaving Hollywood until you've kicked the shit out of it!" But I thought I better find a place to live first. I'd heard that in Hollywood things were larger than life. Well, the cockroaches sure as hell are. [slams] "Producer I.I. Perlstein "acquires Van Gogh's "Sunflowers" for 23 million dollars." Isaac Perlstein started life as a lowly delivery boy. "Delivery boy?" Hey, I better get started! [instrumental music] [engine revving] Everything was going really well.. ...until I remembered that you Yanks drive on the wrong side of the road. [bus honking] [tires screeching] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [tires screeching] Being mugged and having me car stolen turned out to be a blessing in disguise.

No. Not yet. - Is that in my hand? - Right here. Can you tell if I'm going to get wealthy? There are all kinds of wealth. The kind that you buy movie theatres and airline tickets with. I don't know, but you will lead a rich, full life. You can see that in my hand? Oh, yes, your hand tells me a lot of things. Like what? Like it's a very generous hand. And would be happy to move some bookshelves for me if I asked it to. [chuckling] Are you asking? I am. [laughs] You can have it. And I'll throw in this one too. Now, where are those bookshelves? On my bed. Follow me. [birds chirping] Now, I know what you're thinking and I don't blame you. All the way up the stairs, I was thinking the same dirty thoughts. Bookshelves on her bed? Oh, come on. - Well, what do you think? - About what? My behind. Not too bad, eh? You were checkin' it out, weren't you? How did you know? I could feel your eyes on me. I, I was just admiring your frock. It's lovely material, the way it moves. And your behind. Oh, that's very nice too. The whole set moves very nicely together. Very theatrical. Are you an actress?

[Bert] What with lunch and having me palm read I didn't get back to my sucker snipping until just before Jesus returned. Christ, was Jesus mad! I don't think the original Jesus screamed at the moneylenders in the church like he screamed at me. I was afraid he'd have a stroke. He was yelling in Mexican so I didn't understand his words. But his message was clear. I was fired. Mrs. Perlestein felt responsible. Oh, I feel I'm responsible. No. He, he.. Yes, I suppose you are responsible. But if you explain to him that I was working for you.. - Would you like that? - I'd appreciate it. - Just tell him. - No, no. I meant, would you like to work for me? - For you? - Lloyd. Our handyman won't be able to work for a while. Oh. What do I do besides carrying planks? A little of everything. - Everything? - Don't worry, Bertram. We won't overwork you. Come on. Are you ambitious? - Yeah. - What are your dreams? [exhales sharply] - To own me own movie theater. - Mm. - And have a hat like yours. - Here. Keep it. The rest, you'll have to work for like I did. [laughing] Isn't that charming? Isn't that charming? Very charming. Hey, weren't you in the newspaper the other day? I'm in the newspapers every day. I have two pictures playing in 1400 theatres. Ain't he that bloke that bought that sunflower painting for 20 million? That's him. Only it's 23 million. That bloke is very successful. Ta! - Cheerio. - Cheerios. ♪ I'd love to gain ♪ ♪ Ooh-ooh complete ooh-ooh ♪ ♪ Control ah-ah ♪ ♪ Of you ♪♪ [clears throat] She's lo.. Lovely, your wife. Yeah. Would you like to see a sneak preview of my painting? I'm gonna unveil it tonight, right after dinner. - Uh-huh. - Is that money? Twenty-three million dollars for that? It was a steal. Some Japanese shmuck paid 59 million dollars for his Van Gogh, and they were irises. I wonder what they would've got for roses. [laughs] - What kinda accent is that? - What kind of accent is what? Your English accent. Where are you from? Oh, Langmore. It's in the north of England. I can't believe it. - Why would I lie? - It's perfect, perfect. Well, I, I do me best. - I got a job for you. - Another one? That'll be me third today. What's this one? I'm producing this movie, "The Long Lone Night." And the main character comes from Northern England. You're offering me a movie? But I've never.. What's it pay? No, no, no. You don't understand. We cast an American star, Jim Shirley. But the prick insists we pay his way to England to study the authentic accent. And I can save a lot of money if we have him study you. Why are you lookin' at me like that? Well, you just called Jim Shirley a prick. I mean, he's a really good actor. You can be both. And most actors are. Tracy, call the prick. Tell him we got him a coach. Go figure. My wife got me a winner. [Bert] Now, as far as I was concerned, Jim Shirley was a prince. And he treated me like one. Hey! You phony bitch! One more bloody word out of that painted face I'm gonna tear your lying lips off! How was that? It's not bad. - A couple of words need work. - Which ones? Phony, bloody, painted, lying, off. And face. You mean, all the words need work. You said bitch very well. [sighs] Well, I guess one out of ten isn't bad. I think we'll just talk a bit. No more dialogue from the movie. When I go off, you'll correct me. Just two Englishmen chatting. Well, what shall we chat about? That's it. Yeah. Why don't we talk about me birds? Me birds? Eh, that's good, that is. Well, they all say that back home. What do you think about me birds? Oh, the world. I think the world of your birds. 'A bit over plucked, if you don't mind me saying.' [Jim Shirley,] 'So you noticed.' Well, that's good because one of them is yours. - One of them is mine? - Don't be greedy. Two for the star, one for you. Which one tickles, you fancy? Oh, they're all quite capable of tickling that. I've got a very weak fancy. I've been away from me girl for a while. In that case, Sheila is the one for you. - Which one's Sheila? - Sheila! - She'll light your fire. - No. Oh, yeah, she's good. She's a nurse. No. Lights, not lights. She light.. She's a nurse? She turns you on, Bert. She's gonna make you forget that girl back home. Who the bloody hell do you think you're talking to? - I'm sorry. - No, no-- - Bert, I-I-I just thought-- - It's in the script. It's in the script. - See, I thought it's best to-- - Oh, I thought.. Come on, say, "Who the bloody hell--" "Who the bloody hell do you.. "Who the bloody hell do you think you're talking to? Who the bloody hell do you think you're talking to?" [Bert] Now, that was the best job I ever had. Sitting around, drinking, swimming fantasizing, having me fancy tickled by Shirley's angels. In the steam room we became like best friends. You know somethin'? It's amazin' how bein' naked makes some people bare their souls. He told me how he was gettin' it on with Mrs. Perlestein but how he would get off as soon as the movie was finished. I told him he was a cad. I know. Believe me, I used to be worse. Bert...I want you to do me a favor. You want me to entertain Mrs. Perlestein for ya? I'm afraid you're not her type. No, uh, it's my son. You see, my son is coming here for the weekend. [Bert] He was wondering if I could take his place as a divorced father while he visited this exotic dancer in Las Vegas. I realized then that Mr. Perlestein's description of Jim Shirley was quite accurate. He was a prick. Bert, if you would, on the way home from the park if you could stop off at the Circle Gallery in Beverly Hills. Pick up a little package for me. That's the receipt. And here, you can use my Porsche. [whistles] The Porsche. [clears throat] Maybe you better use the Honda. - Yeah. - Yeah. Thanks. ♪ Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa ♪ ♪ Off we go ♪♪ - You wanna drive? - No. Okay. [indistinct chatter] [Bert] I must admit, I was enjoying the day. It reminded me of all those lovely Sundays playing football with me dad. I was kinda proud of meself for helping Jim Jr. forget his father who was a thoughtless bastard. My dad never ran off with any exotic dancers. Come to think of it, he didn't have to. He had his own bit of exotic hurrah next door. Uh, oh! Where do I pick that up, please? Miss Fogelson back there will help you. Miss Fogelson, thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Kimble. I'm sure your husband will love it. Hello. Are you Mrs. Fogelson? Yes. Um, may I help you? Yeah, I've got a receipt. - I'm to pick up a package. - Hmm. Well, let's see what we have here. [screaming] Is something wrong with it? [all clamoring] Everybody, down on the ground, or she's dead! Down! 'Get down! Face down! Now!' You too! [glass shatters] [instrumental music] [gunshot] [Bert] I tell ya. I felt like that Eddie Murphy bloke. The kid told his dad and all his friends about it. But nobody believed him 'cause there was a photo in the papers of the security guard capturing the criminal. Mm-hmm. Well, maybe his dad did believe him. Because the next day, he offered me a kind of reward. Bert, there's a small part in this movie. - Ninety-six. - A bartender. - Ninety-seven. - Ah. - It's only a couple of lines. - Ninety-eight. But I can talk to Perlestein about it for you. - Ninety-nine. - 'Ah.' If you want me to. - A hundred. - Want him to? [Bert] I'd have kissed his arse, if he'd made that a condition. Yeah, okay. That'd be quite nice. Everything was breaking my way. Oh, I couldn't wait to tell Laurel. [Bert on phone] 'Laurel, something big is about to happen.' It's like I'm in the right place at the right time. Did you ever have that feeling? I know something big's going to happen. But I don't feel you're in the right place. [Bert on phone] Not in the.. Oh, I'm living in a mansion, love. And I've got another job now working with.. Are you sitting down? Jim Shirley. - The actor? - 'Right.' Captain Perlestein hired me to hang around to talk to him so he can learn to talk like me. Why would he want to talk like you? [Bert on phone] 'Because I'm an authentic Englishman.' 'He's playing a bloke like me.' I'm his vocal coach. - Bert, have you been drinkin'? - 'No.' Now he wants me to be in the movie with him. I mean, talk about bein' in the right place. Let's talk about that, Bert. The right place for you to be is here, in Langmore. [Bert on phone] 'Why?' I'm pregnant. Pregnant? Who? - Who? - I mean, how? You said, "Who?" Who and how are the same letters. It's just a different order, that's all. Believe me, I meant how! H-how? We've been so careful. It could've been a defective product. Oh, those bloody Crown Royals. [sighs] I'm sorry, Laurel. I didn't even ask you how you feel. - How do you feel? - Right now, nauseous. But it passes. Bert, I don't know what to do. I know exactly what to do. You take care of yourself and little Fred. - Fred? - 'Or Ginger.' 'And I'll take care of everything else.' Look, the money is beginning to come in and we'll be together before you know it. - 'I love you, Laurel.' - Bert, I miss you so much. I know. I miss you too. I don't know what to do. - 'Do what I do.' - And what do you do? - Have you got a pillow? - What? Take a pillow.. ...put your cheek against it.. '...and make believe it's me.' - 'You doin' it?' - Yeah. Now, close your eyes 'and remember what I look like.'

I got to rub elbows with Hollywood's biggest shots. And among the rich and famous is my buddy the shit, Jim Shirley. Who makes my day. [Jim Shirley] Bert Rigby! Get your phony painted face over here. Oh! - How was that? - Not bad. Huh, couldn't have said that better meself. Girls, I like you to meet Bert Rigby. He's my coach and, uh, ahem co-star. - Co-star? - Yeah. I just talked to Perlestein, he said you could play the part of the bartender. [Jim Shirley] 'Would you like that?' Bertram, you can announce dinner. [whistles] Whoa! Yeah! Bloody wonderful. A simple "Dinner is served" would suffice. Ladies and gentlemen, dinner...is served. [indistinct chatter] [Bert] I don't like to toot my own horn but I swear, I'm a natural actor. The way I acted like a butler that night not even a butler would know I wasn't a butler. I'm verypleased with you, Bertram. I have a little extra something for you. In the pool house ...at midnight. [Bert] And I was very pleased with how delicately I handled Mrs. Perlestein's offer. Are we talking about bonking? - We might be. - Yeah. Is that a yes or a no? It's, uh, I want to desperately. But I can't. - Oh. - Hm. You see, there's a girl back home I'm involved with, and she'd be very hurt. Oh! Then don't tell her. She'd know by my eyes. - Your eyes? - Hm. I find you a very, very desirable woman. And if you and I were to be physical together my eyes would cross permanently, and she'd notice that. [chuckles] Oh, Bertram. You're so full of shit. Go serve the dinner. [Bert] I don't believe I did it. I actually said, "No" to sex with a beautiful and wealthy woman. I felt powerful and important. But I never guessed the next morning my name would make the headlines. [woman laughing] [thunder rumbling] - Uh-oh! - 'Not to worry.' I just installed a $100,000 'state of the art auxiliary generator.' And it's not working. Shit, they'll be some ass-kicking as of Monday. - Rigby! - Yes, sir. There's oil lamps and candles in every room. - Mm-hm. - Light them. Very entertaining, Rigby. Start with the toilets. We don't want any accidents in there.

[screams] Ah! Oh, my God! Ah! [grunts] [screams] Something is burning. Impossible, the slightest trace of smoke and heat it'll kick in just like that. [screaming] [groaning] [Bert] Did you read about it? It was in all the newspapers. I mean, you, you heard about it though. I was on national tele. He doesn't understand what you're saying. What? He doesn't speak English. Yes, he does. When he sat down he said, "How's it going, buddy?" How's it going, buddy? - Thank you. - See? That's all the English he knows. He got some free beers. You mean, I've told this whole story.. ...spilled me guts out to a bloke who didn't understand a word I said? Hey, I heard a bit of it, sounded interesting. What happened after you won the amateur show? Oh! Nothing much. I accidently set fire to a 23 million dollar painting. That's all. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, I saw that on the news. Hey, folks, this is that English butler who burned that 23 million dollar picture of flowers. Twenty-three million? You could buy a 50 storey office building for that. [indistinct chatter] [male #8] 'Yeah, I saw it on the TV.' How about a beer on the house? No. How about I buy a beer for everyone? - 'Alright.' - I'm almost broke. - 'Yeah, that's great.' - I hate being almost broke. It's no good being almost something. It's better to be completely something. Come on. Order up. Drinks are on me. - 'Millers.' - I'll have a Heineken. [indistinct chattering] Whoa, whoa! Listen, if I'm buying and you're not drinking that's second class stuff, you're drinking my beer. - 'The beer of beers.' - And what beer is that? Hey, Theakston's Old Peculiar, mate. It's English brew. Best beer in the world, this is. - Really? - 'Yes.' Everyone who's ever tasted it says so. This is the Rolls Royce of beer.
