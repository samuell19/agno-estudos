Where is my daddy? I guess your daddy's gone for a second. Why don't you go back to sleep and he'll be back any moment. But there is a monster under my bed. There are no monsters. Believe me! That's what my daddy always says but there are monsters. What are you doing here? I have a meeting with your daddy. What meeting? A business meeting. And why are you naked? There are no monsters, believe me. Now go back to sleep! Thank you. Monsters exist. Really! Maybe you are right. Want to play? What's going on? What is my son doing in here? He had a nightmare. He was looking for you. He knows he is not supposed to be in here. I'm sorry! Take a seat and I'll be right with you. I am just going to ... No, wait! I'll take him back to his room. Justin! Wake up! What did we agree on? Don't come in here when daddy is having a meeting. Let's go back to your room! -No, please! I don't want to. I told you, there are no monsters. -But there is a monster. Go to sleep and stay in your room! But there is a monster! But ... Where are you going? I don't pay you to be my sons friend! I pay you ... ... to be mine. Who the hell do you think you are? I saved 25 dollars. Do you want to be my friend? I'm already your friend. Please don't go! I have to go. I'm sorry. But the monster! You already killed a monster tonight. You know how to do it now.
