You remember the beginning of the year when most of you thought that Japan was part of Europe? Well, I wanted to help foster your new understanding of the world, so I came up with an assignment. I think you're gonna like this one. You're all going to have to find pen pals. Doesn't that sound interesting? The best way to find a pen pal is to look at the classified section of a magazine or a newspaper. Okay, today is the first of the month. By this time next month, I expect you all to have someone you're writing to. Okay? Anita! Would you care to join the rest of us? Hey, sperm babe. Anita? Are you with us, Anita? I was just thinking about pen pals, Mr. Sheets. I know what she's been thinking. If don't shut your mouth right now, you're going to Mr. Fisher's office. You got that? Hey, Anita! C'mon, don't be like that. Don't be mad at us. C'mon, we're sorry. Let's make it up to you. You wanna come for a ride? Please! Where you going? We're just gonna be driving around. Come on. Check it out. Check out the new moves. Look out! Stage dive! Aha! Check this out. Check this out. You ever seen 400 pounds of flesh splattered all over a dump. Come on, Anita. Bill, cut it out! What's the matter lard ass? Don't call me that. Hey, Anita, c'mon down here. Hey, Anita, is it true you let Joey and Al do it to you? What they say? They said you said, "I believe so." We know you're pissed off at us for giving you such a hard time at school. But you realize that in the end, that We wouldn't be such dicks about it if maybe... you were, possibly, nice to us, like you were nice to Joey and Butt Head? Those guys are fags! That's why we're mad at you. It's only because we like you. You guys really like me? Anita, of course we do, Anita. I'm hurt. I guess I like you guys too. But you promise not to tell? We're not gonna tell no one, Anita. I promise. Come on, Anita. All right. But not with him. Why not? You better lose some of that lard if you wanna party here with Anita. Where have you been? In a place. Shall I fix dinner? I ate already. Now there's nothing left. There's some "yoohoo" left. You mom called this morning. What did she say? Se said, "Hi." That's it? She didn't have anything else to say to me? She just said she was having some hassle with the law over in Fresno. Fresno? Yeah. She wanted 1,500 bucks. I told her, "I'm taking care of your kid. I haven't got 15 bucks let alone 1,500." Nah, she didn't say nothing. Except to start bitching and saying, "Well, you're living in my trailer." Blah, blah, blah. I'm gonna take a shower. How about some company? I'm really, tired, Rooney. "Dear Jenny, Crisson City is a wonderful place. "People here smile a lot, "but I want to get away as soon as possible and come to America. "I have tuberculosis in my foot. Your friend Sayang Ferdinand. PS. I am 14." Good, Jenny. Then, did you find a pen pal? Anita. Um, mine's not from Europe or nothing. It's from California. Very exotic, Anita. Anita met a doe. I wrote him about a week ago, and I got a letter back Saturday. "Dear Anita. What a pretty name. "My name is Howard, and I'm 24. "You said you were interested in how other people live and stuff. "Well, life for me is pretty different "than anything you've known, I'm sure. "I've not walked under the stars since I came to this place. "It's pretty loud, too. "I stay awake at night just to feel the silence. "Yet even then the darkness is pierced with the sounds "of men crying in their sleep. "Now I spend my days painting and reading. "Before, I only knew how to do one thing good. Shoot guns. "I always dreamed of a girl who liked guns. Perhaps it was you I was dreaming of." May I ask where your pen pal resides, Anita? In goddamn Sing Sing. Um, he's a convict up in Chino. That really wasn't what I had in mind when I handed out the assignment. "I've had no contact with a woman "since I got arrested three years ago. "When I read your letter, "I tried to picture you and how you look. Your hair and such. "And it made me feel human again. "Maybe it's crazy, but I feel something bigger than us both "is bringing us together. "I believe in things like that. "I know there's a power out there controlling things we can't. Best wishes. Howard Hickok." "PS. It would mean so much to have a picture of yourself. Or at least a cassette with your voice." Hey, Anita. Billy and me are going down in the dump. You wanna come along? No, thanks. Wait, wait a second. Maybe we got something better to do. You guys said you wouldn't tell, and you told. You had fun. What's the big deal? Makin' like it didn't happen! Don't bother me anymore. I have a boyfriend now. What... what did you get? A dog, Anita? Hey, Joy. I wouldn't put it past you if she's so fuckin' stupid. Hey, don't you guys have something better to be doing right now? Go on, get! I hate those guys. Let's get out of here. This place gives me the creeps. Shit! I'm... I wanted to take up shooting guns. Well, first of all you're standing wrong. You stand with your feet apart. So far. Now, get down on that can and fire away. Squeeze it like it was a zit. Slow and easy. I'm glad you're not pissed off at me. No. A woman oughtta know how to handle a firearm so she can protect herself when a man is over. Will you teach me? Well, I'm tired right now, but we always got tomorrow. "Dear Anita, thank you for the picture you sent me. "You really are one of the most beautiful girls I've ever seen. "Good news. I did what they're callin' a "good deed" around here and I might parole next month because of it." When you gonna let me have a taste of that... Sally, get back to work! "I prevented one of the inmates from killing a guard. "I know I'd have a better chance of getting out if I had a job in some place. "Maybe you can talk to your friends around town. "I love you. "And I feel something very powerful is happening between us. Howard Hickok." Hi, Howard. This is Anita. Do I sound like you would thought I would? And that sure was the nicest thing I ever read. And you said you loved me. I love you more than words could ever know, my darling. I think I have an idea about how to help you get out. It would mean that you'd have to write a letter sounding religious so I could give it to a preacher that lived nearby, and you might be able to get a job at his gas station. Um, I'm gonna go to sleep, so I'm gonna wrap it up now. Sleep tight and sweet dreams, my beloved. Anita. "Since accepting Jesus as my personal savior, "I now realize that nothing has the value if God isn't in on it, too. "My rehabilitation has taught me this. "I hope to get out some day and join a church "that recognizes the Bible is the direct word of God. All my regard. Howard." So, what do you think, Mr. Fulton? I don't know, Anita. He needs a job to get out on parole. Don't need any employees right now. Sure you do. I mean, there's tons of chores to be done around here. And he could help with the services. He's a believer. You'd be the answer to his prayers. And mine, too. Alright. I'll tell you what I'll do. You can tell him he can have a job. Now, you listen to me. I can't pay him. All right? Board. That's all. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Thank you so much, Mr. Fulton. Thank you. Bye. In reviewing the events that brought you here, I can only say that under normal circumstances you wouldn't be seriously considered for release at this time. However, in the light of your recent actions, we've taken another look at your eligibility. I understand that some of the prisoners are threatening you. Yes, sir. I'm in a protected unit at this time. Well, he have a policy toward convicts that save one of our staff members from serious injury. So, we're granting you a parole date. You're a hair off to the left. Mine was too small to adjust with your hands. So, step in a tiny bit here. Line it up to the right. Shit! You're doing good, Anita. You're a natural. I seem to hit things better when I don't aim or think about it, Rooney. You'd make some money at this. Get yourself in a contest. Quick! There's some cuban looney toonies with hard-ons. Get 'em! And always remember to put in two shots. And nobody gonna argue with you after you nail 'em twice. You know, all this shooting has got me feeling kinda good. If you catch my trip. What's the matter? I don't want to no more, Rooney. You're my mom's boyfriend. Ya right! You know what your sweet mom, my girl, is doing up in Fresno? Yeah. She's working in a restaurant. She can save enough money to bring me out with her. Yeah? She's out peddling her ass for some shitskin pimp so she can earn enough money to shoot heroin in her arm. Shut the fuck up, Rooney. Damn you, Anita. Get your ass back here. Don't fuck with me. I mean it! Go away! Goddamn it, Rooney. All right. Just hear me, okay? I don't like seeing you feel bad. There comes a time when you just gotta know the truth about things. I don't want to! I got a boyfriend now. Yeah, right. But he's a kid? Kid don't know how to make a woman feel happy. You think I've been happy here? Get your fucking hand off my leg! Come on. No, I don't want to! Please! No! Stop! Stop! No! No, please! I don't want to. Anita? Hi, Howard. I am sorry for getting you up so early. It's okay. I... I made this for you. Well, I made it for you. Thank you. It's really beautiful. Do you like it? Yeah, I love it. Well, you can put your bags in the back. Okay? Yeah, okay. Back here? Yeah. If I give my heart To you tonight Will you still Be by my side Or will you be gone With the morning sun Sure it's pretty over here. Yeah, it's really nice and quiet. Thank you. There was a lady. I said there was a lady. And you could've taken hot needles. And you could've pushed those hot needles right into her cheeks and she wouldn't have felt a thing. Do you know why? Why? Because God had frozen her face! Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We have ourselves a brand new member. You come on down here, Howard. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Right there. Now, do you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ? Yes, sir, I sure do. Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord. I hope for your sake, son, that you mean that. Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord! Howard, have you been baptized into the blood of the Lamb? I've been baptized. Yes, sir. Well, then, you stretch out your arm. Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord! It's a true test of faith! Because God spoke to the serpent and he said, "The snake has beguiled me." Hallelujah! He said, "The snake hath beguiled me, and then I can flourish." Hallelujah! Because if you believe, I mean if you truly believe in the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, then the serpent cannot harm you. And you will have nothing to fear from any of these snakes. Praise the Lord. I can feel it. Can you feel that spirit? I can feel it. I can feel it! I can see it! Praise the Lord! I can feel that spirit. I can feel that spirit! I can feel that spirit. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! I can see it, I can feel it. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah! Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Mr. Fulton? I was wondering if I could become a member of your church, too. Anita. Of course you can. We always got room for one more. Thanks. I'm gonna go back and be with Howard now. That's all right, honey. Why don't you just go home and then you come back tomorrow, all right? So, how is it going, Howard? Well, it startin' to get to me a little bit, sir. Well, I think that by now you can call me Hank. Good old Pee Wee. That's a rattlesnake. Ain't she sweet. She won't bite, though. She's been damaged. I found her out by the side of the road. Somebody ran over her head with a car. So, she just kinda lost her natural desire to do anybody any harm. What about those other ones? Been run over their heads, too? Well, I kinda "depoisoned" them with a potato scraper. I don't know Hank. Seems kind of dishonest to me. Well, Howard, let me tell you. See these snakes? Now, they're tools to bring people into the lord. How could anything that does that be dishonest? Besides, I've been bit. And let me tell you it ain't worth it. Does Anita live far from here? She just lives down the road with her mama's boyfriend. Yeah? Where's her mama? You know, I haven't got the foggiest idea. She's some kind of girl, though, ain't she? Yeah, sure is. Yes, sirree. I tell you. Takes a real special kind of woman to go out of her way for a man like you. Yeah. Yeah, I know, sir. Hi. I've got something for you. Boy. Why do think Hank is trying to keep us apart? I mean, I wouldn't expect him on doing something like that. I think he's just checking me out, that's all. Yeah, I guess. How come you don't live with your mom? She's up in Fresno working so she can bring me out with her. So, what do you mean? You're gonna leave? I'm not going anywhere. I could get in so much trouble just having these things near me. Don't worry about it. I remember how you wrote in your letters that nine millimeters were your favorite. Jesus! You didn't tell me this thing was loaded. I've got plenty of bullets. You can't shoot out here. Sure you can. No one can hear us all the way out here. Go for it. Alright, if you say so. Pretty good. Yeah. Are you gonna try? My God! That's not bad! You've got a future if you start doing a mass murder business. Well, I don't think I'll be doing that. My God. Anita! Put your top on, Jesus! What's wrong? Cover yourself up. I wanted to make you happy. Yeah, I know. Well, it's just not the way to do it. What I think is that these demons right now are in positions of power. In positions of power in the government and they control the Internal Revenue Service. And they control... How are you gonna find 'em all, Hank? Only one way. Turning souls in the right direction. As many of 'em as we can. Well, I got one for you. How about this? Now, what if a fella believes in the Lord except he's so bad that he gets sent to hell anyway, okay? Now, when he goes to hell, is the Devil gonna be hard on him because he was on the side of the Lord when he was living? Well shoot, Howard. I don't know. 'Cause I never thought anything about that before. I gotta go. I'll be back later, okay? I just got... I'll tell you later. The door is open. Who are you? Howard Hickok. Two hours late. I know, sir. I'm sorry. Mr. Kincaid. Have a seat. I had your file here a while back. Here it is. You did three years in Chino for manslaughter. And you did two years at the Youth Authority in Camarillo for... You pistol whipped your father. How do you feel about that? I served my time. I don't really have to feel anything about that. I know you don't have to feel anything. The question is, do you? Do I feel anything about that? Yeah. The convenience store clerk that you and your partner beat to death feel anything about that? That was an accident. We didn't shoot him or anything. I mean, I had a gun on me. We didn't rob him or nothing. You're with Hank Fulton and his wife? Yes, sir. I work in his garage, and I help with the services as well. Also I help his wife. She's doing some planting. She's got ducks and whatnot. I'm pretty busy right now. How'd you hook up with Hank? Hank heard about me accepting Jesus Christ as my personal savior. That's very admirable. Howard, what do you want in life? Ideally? Well, ideally I think I'd like to be a test shooter for firearm companies like Smith and Wesson or Browning. I don't know, anyone of those. If I had the money, I'd go to gunsmithing school, but I think at this point it would be better for me if I was a test shooter. All right. Nobody's gonna hire you to shoot guns. Why not? All those companies have test shooters. Down to earth. We're talking about you, Howard Hickok. Parolee. What are you doing here? Hi! My boyfriend's got an appointment. Your boyfriend's in with my dad? I'm embarrassed. Boy, Anita! So, where were you last week? Did you quit school or something? Yeah, I'm all finished with that. Joy. Joy, this is the guy I was telling you about. This is Howard. Hi, Howard. I'm Joy. Joy, what are you doing here? I need my allowance, Daddy. So, what are you guys doing right now? I don't know. I need you here. Well, maybe some other time. Howard? Same time next week. Don't be late. Bye, Anita. I want you to stay away from those two. I've known Anita since I was a little girl. Well, it's about time you two parted company. Daddy, she's totally harmless. She's my friend. I'm not talking about the girl. I'm talking about her boyfriend. I can't imagine what was going through the parole board's mind when they let this one out. You can trust me. I know what I'm talking about. I think you're overreacting. Look, just stay away from them. Can you do that for me? Yeah. Sure, Daddy. Promise? I promise. Get out of here. What do you think? I don't know, Anita. Are you guys okay? You need a lift? Yeah! Howard, could you grab me one of those beers under your seat right there? Say, Joy? Didn't your dad tell you he didn't want you hanging out with us? He sure did! Told ya I was trouble. Didn't he? Well, I figured that out myself. Or else why would you be seeing my dad? See I told you he didn't like me. Hey, bad boy, would you pass me that? So, are you diggin' the sights since you've been to Helm? There's, there's always the drive-in movie theater that's been closed for ten years. Or there's always the dump. Every bad thing I ever did, I did there first. Do you wanna come in? Yeah, why don't you come in? Okay. This is nice! Do you like? Yeah, it's really sweet. I've been sort of redecorating. Do you guys want some water? You got anymore beer? No. But I got this. Do you want some? You gotta ask? No. Here. Okay so, what do you think of him? He's really cute! He's cute, isn't he? I'm gonna put some music on. Do you remember that dance we did a couple of years ago? Yeah! Yes, I do. Do you wanna do it? Okay. We're gonna do this dance. Okay. One... All right. One... One, two, three. One, two, three, four. Mr. Kincaid! Joy what are you doing here? Their truck broke down, so I drove them here, Daddy. You go home. Now. I'll talk to you later. What the hell's going on here? Nothing, Mr. Kincaid. Yeah? Get up. Turn around. You got no business here, you understand? No business being in the home of a female minor. I was just here visiting Anita, sir. We weren't doing anything. You're talking to us like we're trash. I know about you. Put out for anything in pants. As far as I'm concerned, you're both trash. You got that? Yeah. You hear me? Yeah, I hear you. Stay away from my daughter. Well, I guess your parole officer doesn't like you after all. Anita, this ain't funny. I'm sorry. Not bad. Not bad at all. You aren't mad, are you? I'm not mad. It's just I don't think we oughtta be into sex just yet. It's okay. You could still come in my mouth. Anita, Jesus! That ain't sex so much. Besides, I thought that's what you wanted. That's all guys ever want. I don't know about that. Sounds to me like you've been hanging out with a bunch of sex maniacs. Hey! You two get your clothes on. Decent yet? No. What're all those guns doing layin' all over the place? This is where I shoot, Mr. Fulton. It seems like a pretty funny thing for a girl to be doing without any clothes on, don't it? As for you, Howard, if I'd known you were gonna be fooling around like this, I'd never would've let you stay here. We weren't doing anything, Mr. Fulton. You go on back to the house, Anita. Howard and me got some talkin' to do man to man. I saw you. You were fornicating her. No, I wasn't. I was not. I'm not stupid, Howard. I can see what's going on. All I got to do is take one little look at her. I can see that she's come of age. She's all pink and juicy. Remember, I used to be a farmer. Look, Hank, I love her. That ain't the point, Howard. Listen to me. And you listen real good, 'cause I'm gonna give you a couple choices here. Don't worry. Maybe I could talk to him. Come on in the house. Anita, you and Howard got some personal stuff that you need to be talking about. Hank says I have to stop seeing you or we can't get married. Mr. Fulton? Can I be getting married? I mean, I'm a minor. Don't I need permission? How about Rooney? Well, he wouldn't have much to say about it. Besides, he took off a month ago and he hasn't been back since. Where would he go? If you're old enough to be doing what you've been doing, you are old enough to be gettin' married. And you listen to me. 'Cause Howard cannot afford to be caught doing the dirty with a minor that is not his wife. Well. Would you marry us, then? Anita, do you promise God that you're gonna love Howard whether he's sick or he's well? I do. Okay. I now pronounce you man and wife. Well, now you can kiss the bride, Howard. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I couldn't consummate our wedding night. I guess this is just gonna have to happen some time. It's okay. There's other ways for people in love to get together. Without having sex? Yeah. Like to tell each other our deepest secrets. I don't think you'll wanna know my secrets. Yes, I do. I don't want us to hold anything back from each other. You're right. I've never been with a woman before. That's a secret. I mean, I've never been able to... You know. It seems like every time I'm with a beautiful woman, I just feel like I'm gonna lose it. Come on, Howard. Where're you going? I'm gonna consummate for you now. Close it! Close it! Who is that? Rooney. He's my mother's boyfriend. He tried to take me against my will. So he... He did? You did the right thing. All right? But, Anita, you can't just leave him here like this. I mean, it's like having a time bomb on your back yard. We have to bury him or get rid of him or something. Well, there's a furnace about a mile away. All right. That's even better. You go get a sheet. I'll get him out. Hey, don't worry. It's gonna be all right. I love you. I love you. Really? Really. Hurry up. We gotta do this quick. All right? Shit. Come on up here, baby, and give me a hand. Get the feet. Are you okay? What's the matter? It's burst. Get his other arm. I got it. It's heavy. Yeah. Yeah, one more. We're almost there. It's all right. He's heavy. He's so heavy. Ready? One. Two, three. You wanna say a few words? I know he was a bastard, but it's a Christian thing to do. Okay. Here lies a pig. May he roast in hell for all eternity. Howard? I don't care if we ever do sex. It's nothing special to me. And I never could understand why they call it "making love." Always made me wanna throw up. And you not wanting it, and still wanting me just makes me love you more. You've been with a lot of guys? Every man I've ever known since I was nine, has wanted the same thing of me. I never felt nothing for a single one of them. Then I started reading your letters. And I started standing up for myself for the first time. You gave me that. You made me free. If anybody tries to make me do what I don't wanna do, they're gonna end up like Rooney. Look at me, Howard. I love you. I don't care what you've done. Don't start thinking about what I've done. We're in a new life now. Hey, Anita! You turned up. Show him. This is very bad. What's bad? You bad? You don't know. You boys oughtta go home. You shouldn't come up here. Why's that? What's going on? You guys having a barbecue? With that face he couldn't rock. Okay, who's gonna go first? I say it's three on one, man, but we gotta flip a coin. I'm first. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Please, get in that car and go home. I don't think so. I'm sorry, man. This is where Anita takes all her boyfriends. You saying you're her boyfriend? No, her girlfriend. We're saying everybody is her boyfriend. I think I want you to apologize first before you go home. To Anita? Anita, who is this joker? Howard, please. Please. Get in the fucking car, son! You better both go home. You want some of this, junior? Yeah. Anita! For Christ sake, look what you made me do! He needs a hospital now! Shit! Damn it! What am I gonna do with him now? I can't just leave him here bleeding like that with this other one knowing about it. Hey, Anita. You better not let this guy do this. Can't we think of something else, please? Look out! Fuck! Jesus Christ! Why the hell didn't you just listen to me? Get down, son. Anita! I'm sorry, son. You gonna have to die. It'll be okay, Tom. Just think about Jesus. Shit. I can't get it started. Shit. All right, hang on. Try it again. Shit. It won't start. What do we do? I mean, we can't leave the car here. We leave the car here, then they'll know and they'll catch us. We can't... Anita, calm down, baby! Let me think. Right. Go get their car. I'm gonna take care of all of this. Hurry up. What if we get caught? Well, I'd get fired for sure. Anita, you might get off being as young as you are. I don't think I'll get that same deal, though. But if you told 'em that I made you do some of those terrible things. I couldn't do that. Sure you could. I couldn't do it. You'd better. Or I'll come back and bite your little butt off. You know, doing these things together, I feel so close to you. You know, Howard? Ever since I got your first letter, I've been feeling close like this to you. I swear sometimes I feel like one of the luckiest guys in the whole wide world. Met a stranger On a train He bumped Right into me I swear I Didn't mean it I swear it wasn't Meant to be Must a been a dream From a thousand Years ago I swear I Didn't mean it I swear it wasn't Meant to be From the bottom Of my heart What happens if a Christian yearned his whole life for Heaven, and then at the last second he's committed some kind of sin that's damned himself to hell? Now, does Satan hold this against him when he's finally in that dark one's power? Where are my glasses? Hey! Hey, Pee Wee! What's the matter? You don't look so good, do you? I have to... Have to send you to the vet. Pee Wee! Damn, you piece of shit. Howard? Anita is here to contain me. I heard what happened. How is he doing? Well, I guess he's been bitten before, so he's kinda built up immunity. Howard, I'd like to speak to you in private. Outside. I'm gonna give it to you straight, Howard. Placing you with Hank Fulton was a big mistake. He's a good mechanical. I know he's just a bit crazy. This is only gonna be a temporary thing, so don't get overly upset. It'll benefit you in the long. Are you gonna send me back to prison? No, not prison. County jail until I can place you somewhere more healthy. Mr. Kincaid, I'm married now. To Anita Minteer? Yes, sir. I got responsibilities. I'm trying to walk the walk here. I think we better talk with my wife. I gotta frisk you, Howard, turn around. You just look for any excuse, don't you, Kincaid? Be a man, Howard. Trouble? No, John, but I'd appreciate it if you stood by. You're being such a dick about this, Kincaid. John, he's a parolee in direct disobedience to an officer of the law. Take him into custody. Come on, son. Don't make it any harder on you than it already is. He's got a gun! Anita! What is he hollering about? Anita! We gotta get outta here, baby! All right. Howard! My God. Over here. Go. My God. My God. Give it up, Howard. Back off. Put those hands up where I can see them. Now, you happy about this? Is this what you wanted, cop? It's not what I wanted, Howard. Look, forget about it. It should be him instead of that cop! Back off! And get those hands up where I can see them! Let's go, please! All right. We'll take him with us. I want you to cover me. I want you to get in that car over there. Okay? Let's go. C'mon, Move! Let's go. Move! C'mon! You get in first. Get in first. All right. Get in. Open the door. C'mon. What the fuck are we gonna do with him now? We should go easy on him. Go easy on him? Shit! Turn around. Don't look at me. You're not gonna do something stupid, are you, Howard? You're the one that's stupid, mister. You wanna know why? 'Cause I've got this gun. So long as I got it, I'm smart, you're stupid. You got that? Now, you didn't think about that happening, did you? I oughtta kill you right now. I just kept your head right off. No, please, don't kill him. He's Joy's father. Damn it! Jesus Christ! Goddamn it, Anita! What are we gonna do with him? You see that girl, mister? The one you called trash? Well, she just saved your life. What do you think about that? You remember that. We can't stay here. Come on. Do you think you hurt him real bad? He brought that on himself didn't he. He's already in the dune. Our lives are over now. Yeah, well, I know when it's over. Not any place for us to go? There's no place for us now. Nowhere at all. What about your mom? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah! Yes! She lives up in Fresno. Howard, she's such a wonderful woman. She'll help us. I know she'll help us. I'm hungry. Maybe we'll see a rabbit or something. We can shoot it. Fuck that. Hey, Anita, do you have to use that language? I need a cereal or something. How much money we got? Twenty cents. Well, that ain't gonna do. I really miss my trailer. I wouldn't so much. Yeah, but it was mine. I'll tell you what. I'll buy another when my ship comes in. Okay. Look out! Are you all right? Yeah. A dog? A dog! Come here, boy! Hi! How big. Huge dog. Hi, big dog. Hi, big dog. His name is Sh... Shlitzy? I think he lives... She lives over there. Let me take her over. C'mon. Come on. It's a big dog. Come on. There she is. Hi! Shlitzy, you terrible thing. We found her on the road. Thank you so much. You going camping? Yes, we are. Well, thanks. Thank you very much. You're welcome. That has been unreal. Ciao, ball seven. So that's why I got mirrors on the tips. Deal! You want a beer? No, thank you. Okay. I want everybody's hands on that bar where I can see 'em. C'mon, put your hands up on that bar. Nobody's gonna get hurt. You got some balls. I gotta hand it to you. Just trying to get through the day. C'mon, honey, get their wallets. I'm sorry. What about the credit cards? Just take the cash. Give the man back his wallet. You're next. Take it easy. Take it easy. I'm just gonna get out my wallet. You scared me. Yeah. That's my whole paycheck. You take it, I'm not gonna be able to pay the rent or feed my family. That's fine with her. She doesn't have to work. I can't take your money. What about me? I got children, too. I got kids. Don't rob me. I can't do this, Howard. For Christ sake, don't say my name! They know who we are! Here, just take your money. Just let's leave, please. You're the cop killers, aren't you? It is him. Okay, all right. We're going to the car. I want everybody to put their hands... I want everybody down in front. I'm sorry. I just couldn't do it. Yeah, well, I'm not gonna turn in today. C'mon. I've never done anything like this. You're the one that's hungry and we ain't got no money. It's so fresh and clean around here. Yeah, sure it's pretty. Yeah, it's very nice. You wanna sit here a while and figure out what we're gonna do? All right. Don't worry, Anita. We'll find your mom. Move along. Get off the steps. Excuse me. Do you know where ABA... Brown. Down the corner to the right. Hey, can we get something to eat? No, sir. I'm just trying to get out, okay? All right. Hey, wait! Wait! Hey, hey! What are you doing? Towing your car, pal. You got a ticket. Gonna tow it. C'mon, man, don't tow our car. You got 65 bucks? I ain't got 65 bucks. Put it some slack. Got a really shitty day. Yeah? Well, I've had a shitty day, too. Look. Let the car off or I'll blow you away. Okay, okay. Get in the car. Have a nice day. You think she'll let us stay here? Sure, she's my mom. Hey. Do you know a Jesse Minteer? A lady with long hair real pretty. Which number was it? I'm pretty sure it's four. Okay, hold on. I'm looking for Jesse Minteer. Could you just tell me where she is? She's my mother. Your mother ran out on a $1,500-bond. Where would she go? Probably ran with that Rooney clown for all I know. You wanna make some money? Why don't you come over here and show me what you can do for me. Pay off your mama's bill. Excuse me, hon. Where's my mother? I want my mom! Hey, don't you use that tone with me, girl. Look, where is she? How the hell would I know? Your mama is a whore and a liar. She didn't tell me nothing! Lets go. Bitch. Hey, wait up. Anita, I'm sorry about your mom. I really don't wanna talk about it. I'm gonna go check it out. Okay. A little pesky. Go on. Get out. Nobody. There's room in hand. Hey. Hi! Come here, baby. Hi! Sweetie. Hi! It seems strange that they just leave their dog here like this. Anything good? I'm sorry. You know what? You are so beautiful. You remind me all those people that we saw in Fresno. All fresh and clean. I don't know. You do, too, Howard. We look like nice people. We are nice people. Come here, baby. Come here. And I swear, you'd make a great mother. Go on, get out of the way, I wanna kiss you. That looks like so much fun! Yeah, it does. I guess we didn't really have a proper honeymoon, did we? No, we didn't. Yeah. Maybe Niagara Falls. That's pretty romantic. Let's go to Niagara Falls. All right. We can go to a lot of places. Promise? Cross my heart and hope to die. Okay, that sounds good. Wait, that's my other line. All right. Me, too. Bye. Hello! Anita! Where are you? Is he there with you right now? Yeah, he is. I just wanted to call and talk. Did he really do all those things they're saying? He ain't so bad. They say that you're in it with him. Anita! We're on TV! My God! Me and Howard are on TV. I gotta go. Anita, wait! Joy, listen. I just wanted to thank you for your friendship. I gotta go. I'll call you. Live from Reno, Nevada. I'm here with Ray Hickok, father of murder suspect Howard Hickok. My god. That's my father. My son? They can strap him in the electric chair and I'd pull the switch. I'd be happy doing it, too. The Police believe the male suspect, Howard Hickok may be responsible for as many as four homicides in the last 72 hours, including the murder of a police officer. There are some questions as whether the 16-year-old girl traveling with him is a hostage or an accomplice. C'mon. Cheer up. We're celebrities. We're gonna have people asking for autographs. Yeah, well, our autographs won't be worth a spit once we're dead. Yeah, well. Maybe we could go to like, um, one of those South American countries, like Colombia or, um, Mexico or Afghanistan or some place like that. Right? I hear Americans can live really well down there. It's like, It's like... Your part of my body. I am, Howard. I am. What? I'm just sad, that's all. What's wrong? Because they're gonna catch us. Well, not if we play our cards right. They're gonna find us, and they're gonna shoot us. And if they don't, then the State will later, Howard. I guess that's pretty predictable? I never really minded dying before. But what I didn't realize is that I was never really alive until I hooked up with you. Baby, I wish you'd never got mixed up with me. What is it? Nothing. Go on, crazy dog! Dad? Go back to sleep, hon. What... what's going on? We found your little friend Anita. She's holed up in a house with that boyfriend of hers. I'm going there now. Dad! Don't forget she saved your life. Go back to sleep. Shit. What's going on? They're out back too. Well, if I'm gonna die, I wanna have my clothes on. This is the Police. Come out with your hands up. This will be your only chance. Shit. This is it, Howard. All right, baby. Now, I'm not gonna get a chance. I wanna make sure that you're gonna get one, all right? Hey you, out there! Listen! You come in here and I swear I'll shoot this girl! You don't need this no more. I mean it Pigs, I'll kill her. She'll be dead and it'll be on your head. All right. You know what to say, don't you? I don't mind dying, Howard. C'mon, you know what to say. When you get down to that station. Don't let 'em get to you. They're gonna try and play all kind of mind games on you. Just gotta remember that all they're gonna try and do is ruin you. You understand? All right. Baby. I feel so much better now. You know that I love you, Anita. I never said those words to anybody in my whole life. I love you and I'll be waiting for you on the other side. I just know God is gonna like me. You know how I know that? Because you like me. He's gonna love you, Howard. All right, now, no more tears. Save that for when you get down to the station. Maybe what we did tonight, maybe we made ourselves a baby. No! All right I'll kill her! I swear I've got nothing to lose! He made me do it.
