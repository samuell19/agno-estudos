What's the matter, honey? Is it me? Oh, of course it isn't. I don't know. In a boat like this, it's uncomfortable. Okay, the boat's uncomfortable, the beach was too sandy, the air in the room was too conditioned... I bet it's the water in the hotel. They should let you know you can't drink it. Hang up a sign or something. You're trying too hard, that's all. Yeah, I need to relax more. We can relax more later. Now, let's do what we came out here for. Well, you're sure that it's not dangerous? It's just wonderful. You won't believe it. Hmm. Hi, Ron. Did you catch a fish? Sort of. It's going to be a nice afternoon. Super Sunday afternoon happening. Of course, 2:30 begins the whole extravaganza... ANNOUNCER 2; Saturday, August 4th, it's the annual Englewood sidewalk sale, and you're invited. Mark your calendar and make your plans early. Call all your friends. This sale will be over before you know it... I suppose you think that's hysterically funny. No, it's Ocyurus chrysurus. Since you obviously bothered to look it up, I won't rip your lips off. Um... oop! Oh! Oh, Chris, get that thing out of my bed! Okay. I'm try... I'm trying. I'm trying. Come on, now, stop it. Get it out of this bed. Hi. Good morning, sir. Really? What's good about it? It's another sunny day. No shit. Uh, about these eggs, they're not as scrambled as I like. That's because they're for Ms. Kimbrough in room 23. This here is yours. Scrambled. You know, man, I can't figure out why I came to a small island for my vacation. I mean, I live on a small island. Oh, really? Which one? Manhattan. Good morning, Christopher. Who is it, Chris? Breakfast, Mom. Thank you. Give me a break. What time is it? Five after 8:00. Going to be late again. It's unreal. This guy always comes when you're just getting out of the shower. What are you, my chaperon? No, I'd rather you looked upon me more as a spiritual advisor. Anyway, you wouldn't have guys hitting on you if you were still with Dad. Yeah, well, I'm not. Why don't we live in a house like normal humans? Because there's no room service. No, really, Mom, this hotel is the pits. Well, it won't be for long. If they want to give me this suite for free while I'm working here, might as well take advantage of it. It's the only way I can save money right now. Remember that job I got crewing on some rich guy's boat for five days? Well, we leave this morning. That's this morning? Mm-hm. I don't know, Chris. I told you I was going to think about it. Oh yeah. Well, everything's okay. No, everything is not okay. We discussed that. I don't know this guy or anything about him. Oh, come on. I mean, you said we needed to save money. Look, I don't like this any more than you do. Sailing around these islands is a tough buck, all that grueling sun and wind... I'd much rather stay at home and experiment with fabrics and colors and things. Oh, things might be a lot different if there were a father figure around the house. Okay, okay, Chris. A hotel... Chris, you are a weird boy. You may also be an imposter. My real son is much younger and shorter. Mom, why don't you just, you know, stand up? I am standing. Dr. Bell, there's some mail for you at the front desk. Thank you very much. Enjoy your breakfast. I am. Doctor? Cindy, it's him. He's the one. Beverly, you've got to be kidding. You know who I have my eyes on, don't you? The lifeguard. Will you look at him? He's stunning. I've got to have him. Come on, Beverly, that lox? Why are you so superficial? He's a doctor. Morning, Mr. Benotti, Myrna. I hope you're enjoying your honeymoon here at Club Elysium. We certainly are. Oh, I'm so happy. Well, let's have breakfast. But, honey, you know I'm not very hungry. We should eat, honey. It's included in the price of the room. Say, I love those shorts. Good morning, Mrs. Wilson. Mm... a little tight at the top. Down kind of early this morning, are you? Well, at my age, every moment counts. Um... Say, Ronnie, uh... You wouldn't care for a casual encounter, no complications? I could show you a thing or two that would put these young girls to shame. I bet you could. You know what the doctor said killed my last husband? No, ma'am. Excitement! You want to lose that boat? I told you the next time I caught you dynamite fishing, I'd throw your sorry ass in jail, and I meant it. And let you rot! Nobody will care. They won't even give a damn. They won't even notice, and I'll impound this boat too. You sorry son of a bitch. I like the smell of this fuse. Think fast. Son of a bitch! We've done it. I suppose you'll be cooking some of these tonight. By the boatyard. I guess I'll have to come by. That means we get to keep the boat? Boat? You call this a boat? Steve and Anne and I go back a long time. Permission to come aboard, Mr. Dumont? Oh, it's you. You're late, and by the way, you may call me "captain." Here, why don't you secure this halyard? You mean the jib sheet, sir? Yes, this thing right here. No problem, Mr... Uh, captain. Now, here's the rest of our motley crew. This is my daughter, Allison. Allison, this is Mr. Kimbrough. Hi. Now, first, I want you to clean out the head and the bilge and the storage compartments, and then I want you to swab down the decks, box up the hatches, and when you're through with that, I want all these fittings polished. Uh, my pleasure, captain. Yes. Now, as soon as all of that's done, we'll hoist sail and take off. Uh, sir, shouldn't we motor past the reef first? Well, of course. "Hoist sail" is just an expression. Our lives are in your hands. Whoa. Make sure you don't put that on our tab. Do it. We're waiting. Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help, oh... It's all right. I promise you, I promise you, I promise you you'll be... you'll be fine. Okay. It's okay. You're safe. Better safe than dead! You saved my life. My pleasure. Oh, it hurts. Can I take a look? Yeah, please. No, it's the other one. Maybe we should get you a doctor. Aren't you a doctor? No. You're not a doctor? No, but I'm a dentist. You're a dentist? Dr. Leo Bell, D.D.S., at your service! Hi. I'm Beverly. All right, then. Is everyone clear on today's activities? The volleyball tournament on the beach at 2:00, the Mr. Muscle contest at 4:30... I'm judging... And the new reggae band at 8:00, which means they might arrive by 9:00, so try to keep the guests happy. Oh, and tomorrow night, don't forget the Annual Fish Fry Beach Festival. Oh, and Anne, I'd like you to give your speech about the spawning, like you do every year. We have some new people with us today. Perhaps you'd like to explain something about the spawning for their benefit. Well, it's an excuse to get drunk and rowdy, basically. This sweet little fish called a grunion swims up out of the ocean onto the beach for a moment of privacy for his mating ritual, and human beings swoop down on him, scoop him up, and fry him for dinner. But how do you know it's tomorrow night? It's always the first full moon after the spring equinox. Oh... but how do the fish know? We'd better put something on. We're heading into port. Aye, aye, captain. Listen to this, Loretta. Log of the Circe, day 26. It's been 18 days since we ran out of our carefully rationed supply of money. Traveling from island to island to island, we must live by our wits, raiding the small ports for provisions and trusting in our swift and sturdy craft for escape. We are sea bandits, taking what we want, giving no quarter and asking none. I think we can continue indefinitely until Daddy catches up with us and takes the boat back. Not bad for a Yankee. We've made landfall at Elysium, just in time. Shall we take a shot at it? Aye, aye, captain. Okay. Hey! I want to talk to one of you. You. Come down here. What's the matter? I've been keeping to the right. It's okay. I'll take care of it. I tried to reach you. I tried to get ahold of you. Your radio was turned off. You know better than that. I know. You scared the shit out of... You scared Dumont very badly. I have to call him captain. Can you believe that? Tell Captain Dumont to keep the radio on because of the storms and the weather. You know that. Let me ask you something. Where are you going? Uh, just around the cays south of Buck Island. Dad, can we go fishing when we get back? Marlin fishing? Oh... you catch one 800-pound marlin, you've caught 'em all! Fishing when we get back? Please? Boring. She's pretty nice. Who? Oh. Ah, well... She's cute, huh? She's okay. What's the matter? Nothing, nothing. Okay, let's go. What did he want? He thought you were a smuggler and wanted to strip-search the boat, but don't worry. I talked him out of it. Hey, Annie. How have you been? Okay. You know. How about you? Same. Routine. Putting on a little weight? I don't know. Maybe. I have to go or I'm going to be late for class. Wait a second. Do you recognize that dinghy? Yeah. It's an orange and blue caravel. Do you know who it belongs to? Do you think I sneak down here at night to memorize boats? Don't they pay you to do that? I found it tied to the channel marker out by the Fitzgerald wreck, and I thought that since they pay you to take boatloads of innocent tourists out there for their drowning lessons, that... Drowning lessons? T-throwing a p-party? You scared me half to death. I think I have to c-call the manager. Oh, don't do that. W-why not? I'm starving. C-come on, I saw you and your friend pull in on that great rig. No, listen, we're really in a jam. We ran out of food, and all our money was stolen. Really? Yeah, really. Listen, we'll make it up to you. What's your name? Mal. Mal. Look, Mal, why don't you come by the boat later on? We'll have a nice dinner, we'll cruise around the bay for a while, maybe get a little stoned. You know what I mean? I'm sure that Loretta and I can keep you entertained. And... and this is dinner? Yeah. I don't know. Listen, Loretta's hip. She trusts my judgment in men. Mal... have you ever made it with two girls? It's a date! Good. We're docked up at the point. Is 6:00 all right? Only, l-let me bring the dinner. I-I'm an amateur chef. I'll m-make something really special, okay? Got to go. See you later, alligator. All right, today's dive will take us down to the wreck of the Dwight Fitzgerald. It was a navy supply ship that went down a couple of months ago. As a matter of fact, we just received permission to dive there, although we're not allowed to go inside. You've got to be kidding. Our first big dive, and we can't even go inside at all? No, absolutely not. Don't worry. There'll be plenty to see. We're going to swim all the way around, and there are already hundreds of varieties of fish that are using the boat as a reef. Boring! Hey, come here. Did you go to asshole school or something? Okay. Are there any questions? All right, everybody, get your equipment, masks, fins, snorkels only. The tanks and regulators are onboard the boat. Let's get wet! I have a question for you. Yes? It seems like you were a good diver when you got here. How come you took the class? Mainly, I was bored, and, uh, I heard that it was part of the package deal. Also, I heard the instructor was very cute. Thank you. Do you dive on the first date? Steve... We've got a deader down on the docks. They just brought him up. Drowned? I'm not sure. Steve, it's one of your wife's students. Oh, man, you've got to be kidding me. Let's go. Drink that. Are you all right? Can I ask you a few questions? Do you feel up to it? Okay. Alone, please. Do you know the name of the deceased? Yeah. Uh, Robert Hayward. Hayward. Was he enrolled in one of your diving tours? Yes. And this incident took place on one of your regularly scheduled dives? Yes. Did you see what happened? He just swam away from the rest of the group. He was only out of sight for a second or two. Did you see a shark at any time? No, but it wasn't that. A school of barracuda? No, but... A moray eel? Steven, would you listen for a minute? It wasn't a shark and it wasn't a barracuda and it wasn't a moray eel and it wasn't a jealous lover. Then what was it? I don't know! That's the point. I'm pretty damn familiar with the marine life in this area, and I don't know! Come on, man, why don't you give her a break? She's had a hell of a shock. She's upset. Who's this? What's his name? Sherman. Tyler Sherman. Steven, I've got to get a look at the body. I only saw it for a moment, under the water. That's out of the question. That's the coroner's job. Steven, I was responsible for that boy. That's my job. I have to know what happened. That's right, you were responsible, and that's precisely why you can't touch the body, because it may be used in evidence in a case of negligence. You are still the most pig-headed person I've ever met. That may be true, but I'm in charge of this investigation, and if I need any information, I'll ask you. What do you think? If I had a little spiffy outfit like that, maybe I could be in charge, too, huh? Do you know that robot? Yes. He's my husband. And here he is. You will not believe how weird this guy is. The word from here is that he hasn't been laid in 10 years. Wait till you see him. You'll laugh yourself sick. He doesn't look so bad from here. Hi. H-here I come. That's what he thinks. Wait till you see what I m-made. I can't wait. Should I j-jump on board now? Yeah, but pass me the box first. O-okay. Okay. Now, untie the rope. O-okay. B-boy, is this going to be fun. Hand it over here. Okay. And don't forget the other one. Here. Okay. Now, jump! Oh, it's... it's a little too f-far away. Can you b-bring it a little closer? Come on. It's just a couple of feet. Oh, okay, wait. Watch this. Here I come. So long, asshole! Hey, are you awake? Hey. Of course! I just wanted to tell you I'm really glad you came with us. So am I. The way your father drives, you'd probably hit a reef by now. That's not what I meant. I'm sorry. It's just such a drag my daddy made us go to bed so early. Well, why does he make you go to bed so early? I think he's just trying to be cool with you. You see, it took him a whole bottle of wine to get to sleep. Need a guide? Works incredibly cheap. Hi, Tyler. No thanks. How about dinner? If you're going for a restaurant, that's the wrong direction. I'm not. That's all right. We can just stroll and talk. Tyler, can you give me a break? I really would like to be by myself. I don't want to talk to anybody, okay? You need to talk to somebody, and, uh, why not me? I am your best friend. I just met you five days ago. And all that time I thought we had this incredible rapport. Okay. Will you do me a favor? Sure. Anything. Leave me alone. Except that. Come on, let me just buy you one drink, all right? Okay, tomorrow, you can buy me a drink. Tomorrow, two drinks. Does that make you feel better? Nope. Anne... How are we supposed to have a love affair if you keep walking away from me? What do you want? I just want to spend a little time with you, that's all. I don't care where you're going or what you're doing. I'd just like to be with you. Okay? Okay. Great. Are you sure? Yeah. Follow me. Yeah, man. It's kind of dark in here. You did say that you wanted to be with me, didn't you? Yeah. You, uh, you come here often? Hey, this is the morgue. Very good. Yeah, I'm kind of a perceptive sort of guy. Oh, no, we're not going to be breaking in here, are we? Oh, Jesus, we're breaking in. Don't leave home without it. Anne, what the hell are we doing in this place, anyway? I'm trying to get a good look at the body before the coroner gets to it. Boy, you are one fun chick, you know? Where do you think they put him? We're going to have to pull him out of here to take the pictures. Oh, come on. Help me. Take this. I'll get my camera. Your method is pretty scientific, lady. I studied marine biology before I met Steve. Now, don't try anything funny. Nothing funny. Mrs. Kimbrough, what are you doing in here? Well... Just came to pay our last respects. Last respects, my ass. You know, nobody's got any respect anymore, not even for the dead. You know, I almost lost my job the other day letting in this other guy because he said he was the bereaved. Then I catch him having a Halloween party. Well, that sure as hell isn't going to happen again. No Halloween party. We were just on our way out. You're damn right you were. Oh, shit, the bike. Keep going, keep going, keep going. Come busting in as if it's a playground. No damn respect. Isn't that right, love? Oh, hell! Oh, jeez. It's tremendous jaw pressure. It sheared cleanly through bone in places. Have you got any wine in the house? Huh-uh. Only Coke, if there's any left. You know, I don't know anything that could do that. Well, maybe it's a new kind of species. You know, something that never existed before. Like a mutant strain or genetic engineering? Yeah, I guess. Is anybody doing stuff to fish? The army was, but that was several years ago. They developed a sort of killer fish to screw up the rivers in Vietnam. Apocalypse 2. And 3 and 4. They escaped from the tank and killed a lot of civilians. Maybe it's the same fish. No, they were experimenting with a freshwater fish, something from the piranha family, I think. Serassalmus... whatever it was, it couldn't live in the ocean. Piranha? Well, they changed it a little, made it nastier. What the hell have you been reading? National Enquirer? No. We get the news here, too. Besides, you're the one who brought up the new species. Yeah, but that was just a joke. Oh, Christ. I'm sorry. I know I've been lousy company, but I just can't stop thinking about it. I know. I understand. It could have been you, or even worse, me! I'm glad it wasn't you. Yeah, me too. Well, thanks for dinner, the show. It was terrific. We should do it again. Tyler... Would you... stay? Just to be here? We wouldn't have to make love or anything. Make love? Anne, that was the furthest thing from my mind. Oh? Boy, these guys... they buy you dinner and they think they own you! Yeah, but that was still a pretty mean thing to do. It was not. Oh, but he was... he was so cute. You'd think a snake was cute. Whoops, I always miss that. Listen, I'm going below to clean up the mess. Okay. Loretta, what was that? I don't know. Well, go look up front. Yeah. I don't see a thing. Okay. Loretta! Loretta! Oh, Jesus, Loretta! Loretta! Loretta! Try to grab on! Annie, are you here? That's your husband. I tried to gnaw my arm off, but there just wasn't time. You came here to talk, talk! You see this? Yes, I see it. Where did I find it? All right, I was there, and I have an answer, if you care to listen. I'm listening. The army has an experimental strain of fish. Fish? You see what's on this? Blood! I found the nurse at the morgue with her throat torn out... on dry land. I've got another girl lying right next to her in the same condition. This is my conclusion. I've got three bodies on my hands, and my wife was the last one to see two of them alive. There's nothing left to talk about. Stay the hell out of this. I don't want any more of your cockamamie ideas. I want you to go home and sit on your hands, and the next time, lock your door! You know, you really ought to learn how to release those pent-up feelings. You know, I've got to tell you, my ears popped a little from that vacuum you left when you ran after Steve. I have a few things to do. There's some food in the refrigerator if you care to have some breakfast. Terrific. I'm canceling the dive tour today, Raoul, and tomorrow, and as long as necessary. Anne, I'm booked solid on the dives. People like the dives. They like you. You're sticking a red-hot poker up my ass by canceling now. It's my advice for you to stop all water activities until we find out what's going on! Look, you're just upset. No boating, no jetskiing, no windsurfing... You're being ridiculous. Or swimming or anything! Anne, you're fired. What? Unemployed, as of now. Oh, and I could use your suite, so please vacate by tomorrow morning. It's Tyler. I'm still here on Elysium. That attack yesterday, I'm pretty sure that it... Well, now, what else could it be, huh? Listen to me for a second. I ran into a woman here who's starting to put the pieces together. I think she could be pretty helpful to us. Yeah, I know that! Very risky. I realize that. But if she's the one that blows the whistle, we don't have to put our asses on the line. Do you understand? Look, just relax. It's going to be okay, huh? I'll take care of it. I'm going to go get a specimen and get right back to you. Bye. Did you see them? Did you see all those fish? One of them came so close I could have touched it. Scared the shit out of me. Are you okay? Yeah. I've got to get my camera and get back down there before it gets dark. I don't think they like the light. Anne... Anne! You can't go down. I have to. If I can get a picture, that's proof. You don't know anything about those things. They're not the same piranha you talked about last night. They're more vicious than anything you can imagine. What the hell are you talking about? Four canisters of fertile piranha eggs sank right there. Three were found. How do you know that? I worked on the project for about two years. I'm a biochemist. You knew? No, I didn't know. I suspected. That's why I came to this island. You knew, and you didn't say a goddamn word! I couldn't say anything. It's all classified! Oh, classified bullshit! Now, you tell me what you know about those things. I can't do that. Well, fine. I'm going. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Just sit down for one second, okay? All right, I'll tell you everything I know. Now, my ass could end up in jail for this, but I'll tell you. We spliced in genes from different species to create the ultimate killer organism... Grunions who could live out of water, Dactylopteridae, the common flying fish you see in the bay here, who it could live in all environments. Do you understand? My God... We've got to tell somebody right now, and you have to come with me to convince them. I can't do that. I'm not even supposed to be here. Tyler, people are dead! You've got to go and tell them what you know now! Listen, I've got to get more information, and then I can fill out my report, and I can submit it to the proper authorities. The people on this island are not qualified to handle this! It's got to go through the proper channels. Fuck the proper channels. Either you help me now or get the hell out of my way. Turn your radio on, you jackass. Six! Channel six! Hello? Are you Dumont? Yes, this is he. What have I done? Let me speak to Chris Kimbrough. They're both gone. They must have taken the dinghy. Chris and my daughter! How long ago? I don't know. I was sleeping. Dumont, listen to me very carefully. I'm only going to say this once, slowly. I want you to stay put. When they come back, I want you to call me on channel six. Do yourself a favor. Find my daughter, and when you do, let me know at once. Okay, honey, this one's for the den. Great. Okay, let's see... All right. Great. That's for the girls in the office. Hey, Ralph. Oh, come on, Myrna. This one's for your mother! Okay. Great. I do hope you're coming to our fish fry tonight. It's really something special. Well, is it included in our package? We're on the modified "B" plan. Well, of course, of course. The music, the hors d'oeuvres, and the first drink are free, and dinner is a gift from the sea. Sounds great. Oh, you might want to have a snack. Things don't really start happening until after midnight. Oh, honey, I just know we're going to have a great time! More pictures now. Do I have to? Mm-hm. All right. This is all we caught last night... and the net's like this... but this is what I wanted to show you. They must be getting damn hungry to eat each other like this. Please, Raoul. I'm not just being hysterical. I'm trying the best way I know how to convince you that these things exist. I've seen them. Piranha? I told you what Tyler Sherman said, what they are, where they come from. According to him, they can fly. I wonder what has triggered this paranoid delusion. Really, I'm... I'm quite concerned for your health, Anne, dear, you've been breathing too much air from those musty tanks. Look, the things are here, and they've killed people. You have, you both have, a responsibility. Of course. Let's be quite practical, shall we? I can't cut all my beach activities. Fiscally, I would be cutting my nuts off. Kimbrough, please, you're a reasonable man. Perhaps you can explain to her how this island survives financially. As usual, Raoul, you're full of shit. The bastards fly. That's it. If you'll excuse me, I've got business to attend to... back on Earth. Bitch. Aah! Aah! Hey, come back here! I'm going to maroon you! Well, I'm going to black and blue you! Well, part of that sounds great! Oh, you wretch. Hop in. Did you locate Chris? No. I know he's in the cays south of Buck Island. You've got to... Relax. Aaron, take her back to the hotel. If anything happens, anything, I want you to close the place down, even if it's at gunpoint. I've heard this twice, Steve. It's under control. Why can't we close down the hotel now? I'll tell you why. I called the Defense Department about your friend, Tyler Sherman, and after a lot of bureaucratic bullshit, I finally got ahold of a colonel that admitted he existed. It seems he was fired from this unnamed government project, that he was unstable, that anything he said was nonsense. They said do absolutely nothing. Nothing. They'd send a team in tomorrow. Oh, well, that sounds real convincing. They're contradicting themselves. Tyler Sherman came down here because he was frightened. He wanted to warn people. That's what he was using me for. I knew there was something I didn't like about him. We'll talk about him later. Right now, I'm more concerned about Chris. Anne, you know how I feel about Chris. I'm not coming back without him. Hey, Kimbrough. Listen, everyone. I just want to remind you that no one is allowed on the beach early. We'll scare them off if we don't wait until they're all ashore. One person can spoil it for everyone, so I really must insist. Aaron? Come in, Aaron. Over. This is Aaron. Anything? No, nothing. How about you? It's okay so far. Stand by this channel. Out. Open up, sugar. Oh, hi, Mrs. Wilson. Is there something I can do for you? You bet. You can help me kill this Mumm's and eat these oysters. You'd better watch out. They're an aphrodisiac. What is it, honey? Hi, Mrs. Wilson. Oh, anything wrong? Uh, no. I guess I have the wrong room number. I'm sorry. Bye. Bye. Bye-bye, Mrs. Wilson. And no one knows what forces bring them to these beaches year after year to find a mate and spawn in the dark of the night. Sorry I'm late. I know why you're late. What a waste. I don't think so. And remember, whoever catches the most fish wins a two-day trip! Air search to unit one. Come in. Over. Steve, this is Anne. Did you find Chris yet? Over. Not yet. I'm going to refuel at Buck Island and stay out for a while. Okay. Everything's calm here. Good luck. Over and out. Aaron, this is Anne. Come in. Aaron, come in! Wonderful. You're great. You're my dream come true. Hiya, lady. There's only one way for a fat guy to be first when running for the beach... Cheat! Light the torches. Don't burn me, eh? Now, we must call to the fish in the traditional style, to lure them from the sea with the ancient rhythm. All right, we must have total silence. They killed my son. I'm going to kill them fish. I'm going to kill them in the wreck! No, Gabby, please, no. You'll never get down to the wreck. Can you hear the sound? Everybody ready? Let's go get 'em! We want fish! We want fish! We want fish! We want fish! We want fish! We want fish! We want fish! We want fish! We want fish! We want fish! We want fish! Aah! Aah! Aah! If I didn't have so much to drink tonight, I'd swear I was seeing things. Allison, wake up. Wake up. We're lost... lost at sea. How romantic. Oh, my God. Allison! Words cannot describe the trouble we're in. I was expecting Gabby. Gabby's dead. So are a lot of people. Have you got the charges he made? Yeah. One's mine. You don't have to go. I can handle it. I might as well. I've got the damn suit on. We've got one hour. What about those lights over there? Where? Those. Right there. Ooh. Well, the red one could be the channel marker by the hotel. Okay, that's where we're going. Steve, just be sure you're clear by 6:30. These detonators are electronic, and the time should be accurate. Anne, don't do this. All we have to do is walk away from this in one piece. I can take care of myself. You just find Chris. Over. Annie, listen to me. Annie! Don't answer. Hey, look. It's Dad! Here we are! Dad! Over here! Down here! Dad! Mr. Kimbrough! He's coming! Over here! Chris, can you drive the dive boat? All right, son, stay right where you are. Baby... Throw me a rope! Throw me a line! Now. What...
