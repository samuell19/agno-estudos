Once upon a time there was a kingdom known as Cratonia. And among the royal family was a prince named Steven. Steven was a bachelor and with no prospects of a wife in the tiny kingdom which did not please his father. And in the morning you're presiding over the opening of the daycare center, then tomorrow afternoon you have your phone conference with Universal Imports. - Universal Imports? - You remember, Your Highness, it's the American company that your father's been - negotiating with. - Oh, yes, of course, extending the Cratonian flag across the globe proving to the world we are more than just a tiny monarchy lost in a crowed valley of larger, richer nations. He's just looking out for the future of the nation, sir. Oh, please, Samantha. You can't honestly believe that. You know well and good my father is just trying to find me a wife. He has mentioned that in the past. Yes, but I have to find someone worthy of being a future queen of our country. Why he thinks I'll find someone amongst the wealthy business people of America. I have no idea. He only has your best interest at heart, Your Highness. If you say so. Okay, what's next? Well... Meanwhile, in the City of Angels, there was a young woman named Cindy. Cindy has had a hard life, but she's making the best of it. Orphaned at a young age, she attends the local college while interning at Universal Imports. She's not having her best day. Oh, excuse me. Whoa, watch out. Oh, I'm so sorry. It's okay, no harm done. Here you go, sir, your double-caf foam latte. Cindy, I told you before, call me Patrick. Okay, Patrick. You're a little late this morning. I know, I'm sorry. I was on the phone all morning - with my landlord. - Is everything okay? Not really. Step into my office. There you go. So why don't you tell me what's going on. Well, I don't want to be a bother. It's no bother. I want to help if I can. You're my best intern, Cindy. - Thank you. - So what's the problem? Well, I got an eviction notice this morning. I'm getting kicked out of my apartment. - What happened? - It's a little complicated. As you know, both my parents are dead. Yes, I know. Well, they left me a little bit of money, but that's all gone now, and I'm three months behind on rent. - Have you tried to get a job? - Well, if I got a job, then I would lose my internship here and I love working here. I'm just... I'm learning so much. How are you paying for school? Well, I got a full scholarship, but that really only covers tuition and books. I see. It looks like I don't have any other choice but to leave here. Well, I can't have that. Ah... I have a spare room at my house. My wife converted it into a guest bedroom. I think this'll work out perfectly. - Really? - Absolutely. And I have two daughters your age. I'm sure you'll all get along wonderfully. Oh Patrick, I can't thank you enough. You know, when I was younger, my mom used to tell me that I had a fairy godmother looking out for me. I guess she was right. Well, I don't know how I'd look in wings and a tiara, but I'm happy to help. Well, I should get back to work. Are you sure your wife won't mind? Not at all. She's very understanding. - Justin! - Yes, ma'am? - Is this the '99 chardonnay? - No, ma'am. You finished the last bottle of the '99 last night. This is the '04 chardonnay. Well, it tastes like rotgut. I'm terribly sorry. Would you like something else? Perhaps I would. You know, Justin, this is the third time this week I have been completely dissatisfied with your service. You have my apologies, ma'am, but you are, if I may say, difficult to please. Hmm, am I? Perhaps you're just not trying hard enough. Here we go again. Welcome home, darling. How was your day? Quite fascinating, actually. I had a phone meeting with the representative from Cratonia and it was the crown prince Steven. - Oh, how exciting. - Yep. They definitely want my firm to handle their trade deals, and he's flying in tomorrow morning - to finalize everything. - Ooh, that's wonderful. Do you think I'll get to meet the prince? It's doubtful. Hmm. Aren't you aware those are last years jeans? I mean, I couldn't believe it. Oh, my God. How awful. She must've been destroyed. I don't even think she even realized. I mean, have you seen her hair? - Who still does that? - Ahem, girls. Together: Hi, Daddy. See you've been shopping. Oh, this? Just a few essentials. Is dinner ready yet? I'm starved. I have some news to share with everyone. He met a prince today. It's not actually the news. Uh, Mona, do you remember my intern Cindy? You met her at the company picnic a few months ago. Hmm, not really. Well, she's having some financial problems and lost her apartment, and I told her that she could stay in our spare bedroom. - Patrick! - Daddy, no! What? Mona, you turned it into a guest room. Yeah, for my guests. And our friends. Not for your servant girl. Please, be reasonable. I'm sorry, Mona, girls, this is a done deal. Cindy is moving in here tomorrow, and I expect you to treat her with dignity and respect. Do you understand? Yes, Daddy. Mona? Of course, dear. Cindy, good morning. You ready to move in tonight? Sure am. Thanks again, Patrick, you're a lifesaver. - He certainly is. - You're too kind. Cindy, this is Prince Steven of Cratonia. Your Highness, this is Cindy my intern. - Oh. - Enchanted. Your Highness. Please, call me Steven. I don't know whether I should, like, bow or curtsy or what. No, nothing of the sort. You're far too charming of a lady for any of that nonsense. Mona, girls, I'd like you to meet Cindy. Hello. Hey. May I take your bag, miss? Oh, I don't want to be any trouble. No trouble at all. Justin, take her bag to the guest room. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Sylvia, Grace, why don't you show Cindy her room. Get to know her, make her feel at home. - Daddy! - Girls, now. Come on up. Would you like me to unpack your bag, miss? Oh, no thank you, but I appreciate all the help. It's what he's paid to do. If you need anything, please don't hesitate to ask. We're all very happy to have you here. Thank you, Justin. So, Cindy, tell us about yourself. Um, well, I guess there really isn't much to tell. Have you ever lived in your car? - What's that like? - Uh, no, of course not. What's it like being poor? Do you have to ask for money from people on the street? Are those clothes from goodwill? They look like it, right? Have you ever slept under a bridge? Do you know where your parents are? Are they in jail? Do you even know who your father is? Well, no... yes, I know who my father is. Okay, no need to snap. I'm sorry. It's just that both my parents have died. - Bummer. - Hmm. Grace, your mother is asking for you in the living room. Okay. And again, miss, if there's anything you need. She already said she doesn't need anything. - Of course. - But I do. - Come with me. - Yes, ma'am. - What's the big idea? - What do you mean? Fawning all over that little homeless waif. I'm just trying to make her feel comfortable. Must be difficult under these circumstances. - She is our guest after all. - She is no guest. She works for daddy and she's practically a servant. I see. And besides, the only person you need to make comfortable is me. If you say so, miss. Ah! Come here. Cindy, are you enjoying your breakfast? Oh, it's wonderful. Thank you. Are you kidding? The food hasn't been the same here since Manuela got deported. Yeah, can we get some decent food around here or what? - Now, girls. - Don't worry. I've been interviewing some replacements. Ladies, I do have some news to share. Prince Steven has asked me to fly back with him to his country this afternoon. There's some people he'd like me to meet. Hmm. How long will you be gone? Just a few days. I'm sure you can keep the office going while I'm away. I'll do my best. Please, tell Steven I said hello. Hah! Steven? Why on earth would Prince Steven care what a common girl like you has to say? - Sylvia, that's enough. - Yes, Daddy. And I expect all of you will be on your best behavior while I'm away. - Do you understand? - Yes, Daddy. Yes. And, so, Patrick and the prince headed off to Cratonia leaving young Cindy behind in a den of vipers. So I explained to the guy that's it's the black card, and therefore it has no limit. What the heck? Was it his first day or something? It was. And his last. I had him fired. Oh, Cindy, come in, come in. Thank you. Oh, no thank you. I don't drink. Oh, you... you thought that? Oh no, honey, no. I was just gonna say that today is Justin's night off and I was hoping you could be a dear and go fetch another bottle of wine from the cellar just like this on, okay? Of course. Welcome back, Your Majesty. Thank you, Samantha. Samantha, this is Patrick, he runs Universal Imports and is here to take care of all that really boring stuff that I don't care about. - So everything. - Precisely. - Hello. - Welcome to Cratonia, Patrick. Thank you. Prince Steven, are all the women in your country this beautiful? Not if you ask my father. Anyway, I'll leave you two to handle all the business, I'll go say hello to father. What did he mean by that remark about his father? Ugh, the king sent Prince Steven to America hoping to find a wife, someone worthy of being a princess. Well, I can't imagine you wouldn't qualify for that. - You're too kind, sir. - Oh, not at all. And the king should know that having a wife isn't all fun and games. I can't imagine that being your wife isn't a wonderful thing. Now you're being too kind. My wife is difficult. I don't know how much longer we'll be married, to be honest. I'm sorry. I know we just met. It's quite all right. I've been through a marriage myself that didn't work out. Really? But you look so young. Young and foolish. I've gained the ability to judge someone's character rather quickly. I don't make the same mistake twice. If only we all had such insight. - Shall we get to work? - Certainly. So as long as you can confirm the product purity, getting the product should be no problem. Great. Well, I do believe that concludes our work for today. Are you sure that's all there is? You Americans sure are workaholics, aren't you? It's not that it's just... Yes. I hate to think we won't be spending anymore time together. Well, just because the work is finished... doesn't mean we are. Far too soon his adventure in Cratonia was over, and Patrick boarded a plane to return to America. However, Tragedy struck as the plane was lost at sea. All aboard were declared dead. Oh, no. Poor Patrick. What does this mean? What's gonna happen to us now? Don't worry, girls. I'm sure your father has provided for us. As for you, Cindy, I imagine you'll want to find another place to live. Uh, sure. - Justin! - Yes, ma'am? - Wine. - Yes, ma'am. What troubles you, my child? Who? What are you? Why, I'm your fairy godmother here to protect and guide you during times of need. My mother always told me I had a fairy godmother, but, I mean, sometimes I really doubted it. Honey, you should always listen to your mother. Now what's wrong? A really good man has died. He was like a father to me. And now I don't know what I'm gonna do or where I'm gonna live. Why can't you just stay here? Because those nasty, evil women. Now what would your mother say if she heard you talking like that? She wouldn't like it very much. My dear, you should carry on with strength and dignity and offer only kindness and love just as your parents would've wanted you to. Yes, of course, you're right. It's just I get so lonely. Hmm, well, I can help you with that. I'm here to fulfill all your needs. Oh. My mother never told me about this. Mona, sorry I'm late. Sorry. I was just finishing up some last minute work. It's quite all right. Well, first off, I do want to say I'm sorry to hear about - the death of your husband. - Yeah, real tragedy. So about the will. Ahem. Um, well, unfortunately, I do have some bad news. What? Patrick was very heavily in debt and he had very few tangible assets. Now he owes a lot of back taxes. So the few assets he has are gonna have to be sold off to pay that. What exactly does that mean? The good news is you get to keep your house. And so if Brad's back on the market, then like, why not? - Did you really? - Oh my God, you wouldn't? - Grace, Sylvia! - Hello, Mother. What's wrong? Whatever you have in those bags has got to go back to the store. But I just got... I just came from the lawyers office and we are stone cold broke. Oh, my God. We're gonna live under a bridge. No, we get to keep the house, but that's about all. All the credit cards have been cancelled. - Even mine? - Mm-hmm. And I've had to let the staff go. - The cook, the maid... - Even Justin? Yes, even Justin. Humph. He's packing now. What're we gonna do? How are we gonna survive? Don't worry. I have a plan. Cindy, what're you doing? I'm leaving like you asked. Oh, no, no, don't be silly. I would never kick you out on the streets. - Mother! - What? It's okay. We girls have to pull together, roll up our sleeves, and do what needs to be done. That sounds like a marvelous idea. Great. So this means we all have to pitch in. But we can do it, right, girls? - Sure. - Yeah. Well, it's almost dinnertime. Well, dear, dinner is not gonna cook itself. Oh, of course. Kindness and love. Kindness and love. Kindness and love. Justin, I just heard the horrible news. - I'm so sorry. - Yes, ma'am. - What're you gonna do? - I'm not certain. I have a cousin in Iowa who owns a farm. He's always looking for a guy that can shovel pig shit. You poor baby. Would you like a going away present? - A going away present? - You know what I mean. - Ah... - Strip. Some time passes and Cindy tries her best to only show kindness and love although Mona and the sisters don't make it very easy. They treat Cindy as a poor servant girl. Meanwhile, the prince went about his work for his father, but he never forgot the bright, beautiful girl he had met in America. Your Highness, here are the initial figures from Universal Imports. I want to see it. How is the new executive Brian that we're dealing with over there? Oh, he's fine. Quite competent, but he's no Patrick. No, I suppose not. Have we heard any news about Cindy? Not much I'm afraid. Brian says that she's still interning at the company, but she keeps to herself. Poor thing. - Samantha? - Hmm? I just thought of a marvelous plan. This year instead of the usual royal ball for New Years, I'm gonna throw a New Year's Eve party in America and all of our new training partners. I think that's a great idea. And I want to invite everybody from the company including, all interns, mind you. Of course, Your Highness. Girls, we're saved. Look. What are these? These are invitations to Prince Steven's New Year's Eve party. And you know what? I heard from a very reliable source that the prince is looking for a suitable wife from America. So listen up, girls, this is our big chance. So don't blow it. One of you has to snag that prince as a husband. - Oh, no problem. - Yeah, we got this. See this is the answer to all of our problems. - Dinner's ready, everyone. - Oh, I'm sorry. We're not gonna be eating. We have to go out and buy some new dresses. I thought we couldn't afford things like that. Special occasion, dear. The right dress on you or your sister and we won't have anymore money problems. Oh? What's the special occasion? Prince Steven is throwing a New Year's Eve party - and we've all been invited. - Prince Steven? Oh, it'll be so nice to see him again. You don't think that you're going. - But I thought... - I'm sorry. There wasn't an invitation for you. And plus, look at yourself. Do you really think that he would want you at his party? I guess not. Yeah. Well, here you go. One for you... one for you. One for me. Oh, look, an extra one. Ah, why the long face, Cindy? Ugh. I thought you had abandoned me. Never, my child. It just gets a little busy during the holidays. Now what's the problem? Well, Prince Steven is having a New Year's Eve party and I'm not invited. I see. I'm afraid I'm never gonna see him again. Well, now, we can't have that, now can we? On your feet, Cindy, you're going to the prince's party. But... well, I don't have anything to wear. I can't afford those fancy dresses people wear to those things. Ugh, my child. Now I think you're ready to go to the prince's party. But how will I get there? I don't even know where it is. Ugh! Oh. Where are we? Take a look. We're here. Oh, I'm sorry. Here. Good? Okay, now remember, girls, be on your best behavior and no matter what happens, you have got to get the prince's attention, okay? Let's do this. Oh, but I don't have an invitation. Ugh. You think of everything. I always do. But how do I explain to Mona and the girls how I got into the party? They know I don't have an invitation. Hmm. Oh, they'll never recognize you. Wow, thank you. Oh, but you must be warned. The spells are only good until the stroke of midnight. After that, everything will revert to the way it was before. Including sending you back home. Okay, I got it. Go get 'em, girl. Come on, girls. - Your Highness. - Ladies, welcome. My sincere condolences on the loss of your husband. Yes, thank you. Where's Cindy? Didn't she come with you? Yeah, she's so busy with school, you know. I see. Perhaps you would like to dance with one of my daughters. Perhaps later. I have to greet all of my guests. - Of course. - Excuse me. Welcome, lovely lady, to my party. I am Prince Steven. Thank you for inviting me, Your Highness. Would you care to dance? I'd love to. This is outrageous. He hasn't danced with anyone else all night. And who is that girl? No one seems to know who she is. Don't worry. We'll get our chance, girls. Just wait. And then my father said, "If I can't do it as a king, when can I?" Oh, Your Highness, your father sounds quite amusing. - Steven, please. - Steven. - And your name? - Cin... Cinderella. What a lovely name. Oh, I feel so foolish. I just realized I've spent all night talking about myself and I don't know anything about you. You seem so familiar to me, but we haven't met before, have we? Well... Oh, it's nearly midnight. The new year. I can't think of anyone I'd rather be with - just now. - Oh, I got to go. - But it's almost New Years. - Oh. Guests: Ten, nine, eight... Happy New Year's, Your Highness. Seven, six, five, four, three, two... - one. - Oh! Happy New Year! Cinderella? Cinderella? Time passes, but Prince Steven never forgot the young woman from the party. One day, an idea springs to mind. - Samantha! - Yes, sir. Do you still have the guest list to the New Year's Eve party? - Of course. - Get it. - Sir? - Everyone at the party had to have an invitation, right? Of course, but there was no Cinderella on the list. No, but the owner of this shoe must be on the list, whatever her name. We're going to visit each one. Sir, we had people from several different countries there. Don't care. Get the list and gas up the jet. Your Highness, please come in. Thank you. Sorry to drop by unannounced. No worries. You're always welcome. Girls, look who's here. Prince Steven. So what can I do for you, Your Highness? I'm here about this. A shoe. The night of the party there was a young lady that I danced with, perhaps you saw her, - the one with the mask. - Mm, yes. I'm trying to find her so that I can make her my wife. I've been to see every woman at the party, none of them have fit this shoe. Oh, that's my shoe. I recognized it instantly. Don't be silly, Grace, that's my shoe. How foolish of me to lose it. Girls, girls, please. Perhaps if we were to try it on. You've just got to push it in. It's always been pretty tight. I'm sorry, Grace. This isn't your shoe. I could've told you that, Your Highness. Here you are. See? It fits. I told you. I don't understand. You're the last ones on the list. - Cindy. - Your Highness. It's so nice to see you again. And you. Perhaps you would like to try this on. - Oh, it couldn't be hers. - No way. She wasn't even there that night. It's you. - Cinderella. - Yes, Your Highness? Would you do me the honor of becoming my bride? Yes. Oh. Atta-girl. Will you ladies excuse us please? Soon after that Prince Steven and Cindy got married, moved to Cratonia and eventually became the king and queen. As for Mona and her daughters, Cindy made sure they were taken care of. She brought them over to Cratonia where they worked as scullery maids. And the king and queen lived happily ever after. Here you go, sir, your double-caf foam latte. My mother always told me I had a fairy godmother but, I mean, sometimes I really doubted it. Your father sounds quite amusing. And then my father said, "If I can't do it as a king, when can I?" I just thought of a marvelous plan. This year instead of the usual royal ball for New Years, I'm gonna throw a New Year's Eve party in America. Enchanted. Together: Hi Daddy. Fawning all over that little homeless waif. What's it like being poor? Do you have to ask for money from people on the street? Oh, my God. We're gonna live under a bridge. You poor baby. Would you like a going away present? Sir, we had people from several different countries there. Well, just because the work is finished doesn't mean we are. I've gained the ability to judge someone's character rather quickly. I don't make the same mistake twice. And I have two daughter your age. I'm sure you'll all get along wonderfully. Prince Steven, are all the women in your country this beautiful? Yes, ma'am. I have a cousin in Iowa who owns a farm. He's always looking for a guy that can shovel pig shit. Yes, ma'am? Good news is you get to keep your house. Perhaps you would like to dance with one of my daughters. Of course, dear. I just came from the lawyers and we are stone cold broke. So I explained to the guy that it's the black card and therefore it has no limit. Why I'm your fairy godmother. Go get 'em, girl. Ugh, honey, you should always listen to your mother. On your feet, Cindy, you're going to the prince's party.
