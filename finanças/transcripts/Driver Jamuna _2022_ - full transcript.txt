'What wrong did Jamuna do?' 'It is all in your mind' 'You ask her directly' Typical bailiff answer!

'Jamuna, I agree the photos make her cry and so you removed your appa's photos' 'What can you do about her memories embedded in your amma's heart?' 'Of course I can't do anything' Ma Uncle, take her inside Aunt, what are you mad about now? I've told you like a broken record You refuse to have an open mind Nowadays a whole new avenue has opened up for women professionally Why should you reject all that and take up a job as driver? Listen to me, Jamuna Quit this driver's job I don't like it - Aunt, wasn't my dad a driver? - He's a man! You are a girl You'll have a hard time in life if you stick to this job I don't agree with you, aunt Your younger brother got a job in Bangalore as an engineer 'He has mortgaged the house and helped himself to the cash' 'If only your dad had been sensible he wouldn't have died' 'If you were sensible too you wouldn't be so stubborn' - Aunt - 'Get this into your head' 'If you have to settle down well in life' ...first you should be selfish You won't understand anything I tell you now, aunt Pcccht! Did your brother call you? He spoke to me yesterday Don't talk to him hereafter Amma Shall we both go out this evening as soon as I'm back from work?

I was just kidding, sir You booked this cab from your mobile So I have your mobile # in my phone I have True Caller app in my phone That's okay, but the director waiting in Neelankarai? Do you need a PhD to figure this out? Just paying keen attention is enough Half the technicians in film industry have shifted to ECR side I take 3 trips a week in this direction Besides all that, a person's name and phone number is all one needs We can get all his details, A to Z She is just fibbing Excuse me - Greetings, sir - Hey! Bless you Sit down How do you know someone is out to kill me? Listen to MLA Karthikeyan's message 'Yov! Politics is a war, man' '3 consecutive times in Maragadha Velu's constituency' 'I used money power and defeated him as Member of the Legislative Assembly' But people's favorite is Maragadha Velu His son Manickam wanted to enter politics Maragadha Velu was not inclined to let his son enter this dirty world But his son Manickam is very smart He stood as an independent candidate and won the Corporation election He became a councillor Even if Maragadha Velu wants to he can't hold his son back now His party members will support him But despite all this, Maragadha Vel won't make his son contest in this election Only he will contest He will win and become a minister We won't be able to do a damn thing In the coming election if Maragadha Vel is not around And if his son contests it will be favorable to us Do you get what I am implying? If I am not alive My son will take my place He can be easily defeated You claim that's why Karthikeyan is hatching this plan, huh? But how did you get this voice recording? The driver working in MLA Karthikeyan's house And the cook in that household They are my spies Why are you playing with their lives? He is head deep in corruption That's how his brain will work But why should I think he is out to murder me? Look, I am not here for the name, fame, position or orchestrate political ploys I am here to serve my people If I win and occupy a seat in the Parliament, I'll speak for the people These statistics or Opposition can't change that course of action I told you in the club last night I have no further information Don't call during the day It's risky, bro You were sloshed last night That's why I'm calling you when you are sober, tell me Some obituary posters need to be stuck it seems They wanted a reliable gang 'I gave them the number Please ensure our leader is safe' We need more men Call them here immediately Excuse me [loudly conducting an orchestra] Thriller genre Theme is scary That tune will terrify the listener always Weren't you scared? Terrifying? Nice - Jamuna? - What, uncle?

Nothing serious When I opened the boot, edge of some sharp steel scratched me Manickam Don't obsess about your father Call me if there's any issue I'm close by - I'll take leave, sir - Take care How can I help my leader? Am I your leader? I address Maragadha Vel only as 'sir' But you are the one I call 'leader' Wow! You'll make it big in politics I should measure my words with you Instead of throwing this paper out You can confess you aren't part of the wedding group!

Now I know why the lawyer asked us to wait I don't get it - Philomi - Akka? 1 minute, hold I'll give the phone to the doctor 'Jamuna, amma's stiffness is getting worse' 'Going by her symptoms, I think she has deteriorated to the next stage' As far as possible, we must admit her in the hospital as early as tomorrow 'With continuous therapy she will definitely improve' 'Jamuna, don't worry' 'Okay, doctor' 'We can discuss it when you get back' 'Akka, amma wants to see you' Switch to video call - Move - Car took a dizzy turn (Don't worry) (I am really fine) (Attend to your work) Hey! Look If she wants to cry ask her to go home and cry Sorry You said you checked his pocket and he didn't have any powder I checked, bro There wasn't any powder on him Why didn't you check his in pocket? Let him be, he knows his limit Nothing will go wrong Situation highly risky Ask them to hurry up Yes, man Sir, tea - Give it to sir - Sir? For you Why penalise your stomach because you are stressed? Waste of tracking them That Palayamkottai gang is travelling in a car now In a call taxi The driver is a girl If only we are given the force we are asking I can lock this gang easily But they are delaying it The delay is because of the retired Inspector General I feel he is behind this case Don't we know? His only son and daughter-in-law were killed But how can he interfere because of that? He has clout within the department and in political circles We have to wait till we get our back up - We will have more casualties - Let them die But we won't have time to think about it We would've moved on to the next case by then - Hello? - 'I am Subash' 'Asst commissioner of police' Tell me 'Your passengers are mercenary killers' 'You don't worry' 'We have your car completely under our surveillance' 'Talk to me as if you are talking to someone else' Okay, doctor 'But I am scared' My mother has no one else, doctor Similarly I have only her in my life I hope you understand, doctor - 'Tell me' - Somehow set it right, doctor I trust you completely Nothing dangerous should happen, please 'Don't get emotional You will be fine' 'We've locked the road, ahead and behind for 3 km' 'Your car is under our control now' 'Move the barricade and block' 'Quick!' 'Buckle up' Come, shift it here What should I do, doctor? Are the accused harmed? Yes, doctor What kind? I don't know how to explain, doctor Pistol, gun, anything like that? Nothing of that sort, doctor Sickle or knife? Yes, doctor You are right 'Nothing else' Tell me what I should do 'Just follow my instructions carefully' 'Exactly 1km from where you are' 'When you cross the arch of Vishnu temple in Thiruvadandhai' 'Beach View is on the left' Stop the car as if you are stuck - Hey! - 'Pretend the car has stalled' 'Let the gang be seated in the car' 'Step out for 5 minutes' 'Open the bonnet and pretend you are trying to repair' 'But they shouldn't suspect you' We'll handle the gang in that time gap IG is asking you to change the plan - Sir - Huh? What did your 'doctor' tell you? He didn't say anything else He did Yes But I was so scared I didn't hear a single word Let go Let go of me Let go Don't strangle me - 'Ask him to let her go, bro - Now she'll cough up the facts' Let go...let go of me Let go Let go of my throat Jamuna, drive, my dear 'You are doing a great job' 'Watch out' LET GO! Let me go LET GO 'Lorry...lorry Let go of her, bro' 'Lorry, bro' 'Fast...fast' Go...go faster 'Drink water' Hey! What you experienced just now That is 'fear'! If you think you can escape from us It will be only for today We can barge into your house tomorrow If we do so No one will be alive in your house Only the house will remain as brick and mortar 'When we decide to kill a man' The police can't always save our target Do you know why I spared your life now? You are a 'worth' driver Your car has to go in the route I specify Understand? 'Climb down carefully' 'Slow down...slow down' - 'Go slow - Send the vehicles' - 'Quick! - Go...go...go' 'Send the 2-wheelers' 'Just follow my orders, Subash' Okay, received 'Don't stop' 'Keep moving' 'Go...go...keep going' What is the IG saying? Asking me to handle it as a 'hit & run' case How's that possible? We notice the car as we are driving casually You get down and interrogate the driver At the same time I find the weapons in the boot Take the group from the car in our jeep and we interrogate them formally At that time, the backup force will reach the spot IG wants us to touch our nose indirectly over our head You see our nose is a scenthound! Sir, as far as our case goes Our revolver is just a puppet following his orders, sir 'Which route should I take now?' 'Reverse and take the Kovalam route' 'Don't talk like a mad fellow' - 'Hey! - Police will be waiting if we reverse' 'Dimwitted dunce Police will be waiting ahead too' 'You want us to get caught, eh?' Then how will we go? Whatever plan the police have hatched According to their bloody plan Take the same route Drive past the arch at Thiruvidandhai temple Let the car halt at Beach View Let the driver get down She will open the bonnet and check why the car has stalled The next move after that I will let you know Drive Oh God! 'Gurumurthy, cab position?' Car on position, sir - 'Shakthi?' - Sir, watching Move closer, when the jeep closes in on the cab Okay, sir That Asst Commissioner of Police is a bit of a hyper case Must watch him carefully Okay, sir I'll ensure nothing goes amiss, sir We were looking for a 'Hit & run' case, right? It's this car Hello! You there Show me your RC book 'Show your Trip Log?' Where were you last night from 10:00 to 11:00 p.m? - Near Porur, sir - Sir, look inside Where are the 'accused' passengers? He's the only passenger in this trip, sir Where did the passengers seated at the back get down? I am the only passenger, sir We also know all the ploys these criminals resort to Don't risk your life trying to help them Sir, in this particular trip I didn't take any accused He is the only passenger, sir Sir, if I don't say this they have threatened to kill me My mother stays alone and she is a patient, sir - Save me someho- - Hey! Didn't you speak clearly on the phone? Muttering under your breath now - Tell me where they are now - I don't understand what you want, sir He is the only passenger I didn't take any other accused I don't know what will happen next I am very scared, sir - Sir, help me - Acting smart, eh? I'll file a case and take you into custody Sir, call and inform your IG Okay, sir Let the patrol vehicles stick to their rounds I want that gang nabbed No, sir Car covered as per our plan But the gang isn't in the car, sir 'Not at all, sir' 'We followed your orders and executed it correctly' 'We don't know how they escaped, sir' - What, madam? - Hey! 'Hey! Drop your gun and sit down right there' 'Don't die' Sir, accused has a gun too Whatever happens at that spot nothing should happen to that gang Sir, should the police stand with hands folded when lives are at stake? Hey! Arrest them Make them talk Every word they utter is important 'Nothing else should happen beyond that' Stop the car Music director Get up and sit properly Play music Sing song [humming in a scared tone] Music included You think the person who paid us for the 'wedding' is in this house? [irrelevant chatter] I told you right in the beginning to check if Belsath has powder on him We are in a fix! The cops will be patrolling all over We will definitely get caught Okay, just tell me what we should do now There's no problem here We can 'tie the noose-thread' at the given time for the wedding But the headaches are the driver and her passenger Witness Then we will be nailed, bro Fine, I'll handle them - Get down - Belsath, Bhaskar called We won't squeal to the police Please let us go Aren't we obeying your instructions? Belsath 'na The gunshot will be heard, bro 'Instead of that' Why is my mind changing now? Till we cross Chennai Let her be with us How long will it take to reach Devaneri? Another 10 minutes Make us reach in 5 minutes 5 min- How can we reach in 5 minutes? [humming] Didn't he pay you to take another cab? Can't you go faster than this? If you slow down from the present speed Your head will get the same knock your passenger just now got! If you don't take us in 5 minutes flat My mind will get re-set again! 'Why do you get angry, dear?' 'Your appa's advice is always for the good of everyone' 'Don't you know that?' 'You were concerned of the welfare of everyone in our neighborhood, pa Did you ever think of us, pa? Whom else do we have other than you, pa? Tell me if I am right or not? Because of men like you My father died Who is your father? Do you have a photo? For all you know, we may have killed your father I know how he died I didn't mean that If a family member dies That family will be shattered How are you able to kill a person for the sake of money? Ask the same question to your guardian deity 'Esakki' She is also just like me An ordinary woman 'Clear the road Ambulance is leaving' 'Okay, sir' You are hiding something from me I don't understand your plan By bending this case to your whims and fancies I don't know how many more lives will be lost I can't cooperate any longer without knowing the truth Simple The man who killed my son should meet the same fate I need this gang alive for me to fulfil my desire By nabbing the agent behind this gang I need to know who ordered my son to be killed I want to kill him with this same gang After they kill him we must 'encounter' this gang I am using your uniform If you can't comply let me know I can do this with the help of some other officer "Shall I dance in your eyes anew? Whatever you ask, shall I give you?" "Shall I enter your heart so true? You are my heart, my beau" "Shall I caress your cheeks?" [song from 'All In All Azhagu Raja'] Belsath, shall I tell you something funny? He is hosting us to his Last Supper when we are his killers! Maragadha Vel is truly a gentleman! Suddenly turning over a new leaf? Are you having second thoughts? We can always redeem our sins with a repentance ritual! If we don't have targets like this our pockets won't get lined! 'Listen, Jamuna You are standing in one spot' 'A person falls down right in front of our eyes' What will you do? Shouldn't we immediately extend a helping hand? It's the same with life, my dear We don't have to go in search of someone to be of help But aren't we responsible too for what's happening around us? You may not realize the effect of your father's words today But you'll understand one day 'Police Station Pattipulam' - Huh? - Button? Go to the police Huh? Tell the cops Hey! What did you do? Stop the car Will you stop or not? I couldn't control the car in that speed The door wasn't shut properly I know Your mind is changing Sir, no one can get into your house when we are here to guard you - Yes, sir - Hey! Keep quiet 'Appa, what is the matter?' Get that black note pad 'Sir, your coffee' - Hey! Why didn't you tell? - Stop it Will he do this deliberately? I'll wipe it clean, sir I'll clean it myself Only then he will reform You go In the same constituency I was MLA for 3 terms Karthikeyan has occupied my seat today How? Power of money That's his strength But he still wants to kill me Why? People's good opinion of me That's my strength Why did I make everyone believe I dislike you entering politics? I made you fight with me Made you drift away from me I made you contest in the councillor election And I made you win Tell me why? People should hold you in high esteem just like they do so with me Who are these people? Not someone living in a remote village Those people include our employees in the kitchen, bathroom, garden I got this title by making false promises and usurping this post with difficulty I have to hand it over to you I won't let anyone grab it from me in-between I'll go to any extent for that You can't even understand this Yuck!

I came at your request We've reached your location I don't think so 'After we decide to carry out a deed' We shouldn't be scared If you get scared selfish interest will creep in More than affecting others It will destroy us 'Buddy, we will take it if needed' 'Let it be in the car' - Hello - I'm the Inspector from Pattipulam station - Tell me - 'Ex-MLA Maragadha Velu' News from his beach house about a gang of mercenaries Who was your informant?

Then totally 5 of them - No - No...? Only 2 people can share a trip 3 passengers means it is a separate trip There were only 2 passengers at the back Only 2 passengers, huh? 1-2-3, no?
