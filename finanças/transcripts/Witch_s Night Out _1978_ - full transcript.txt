(electronic music) - [Witch] Just you wait, my darlings, till you meet your gracious hostess. * If your stuck inside and you can't get out * But you feel like being free * Grab a witch and make a switch * And see what you can be * That's Halloween witch magic * Halloween * Halloween witch magic * Halloween * Halloween * Halloween witch magic * Halloween, Halloween, Halloween * Halloween witch magic * Halloween, Halloween, Halloween - Boo! (growling) - Hey Tender, nobody will know who we are. - Hey Small, we're gonna scare everybody. I love Halloween! - Me too! - I hate Halloween! Bleh! - Yeah, Malicious, it's rotten, rotten, rotten, rotten. - You know, Halloween is for children. I mean, one wouldn't want to see grown up adults running around in silly costumes. - Oh I don't know, Goodly. I think that dressing up is just immature, but Halloween, surely it could be nice for everybody. I mean, I think it's important that adults learn to express themselves. - What we need is something to make Halloween meaningful to adults as people. Yes, my friends, with community cooperation, a little brainstorming, listing our priorities, we could achieve a really definitive Halloween experience. Get people involved, for instance-- - Couldn't we have a party or something? - Party shmarty. Dress up like monkeys and hang from the chandeliers. - You can just go as you are, Rotten. - Yeah, why don't you rent yourself out as a spook? You'd make a fortune. - Now, now, you two. I think we could have a nice party. We could decorate some place as a haunted house. - Right on, Nicely. I know where there is a haunted house. - The old empty house on the edge of town. - Exactly! What we need to do is organize, delegate responsibility. Why I intend to make this the most important Halloween this town has ever seen. Nicely, you phone everybody and invite them to a Halloween party they'll never forget. And you, Malicious, you look after the food. Get candy kisses, pumpkin pie, taffy apples, et cetera, et cetera. And I, Goodly, will investigate the old empty house that people seem to think is-- - Haunted. - Haunted, quite right. Yes, Rotten you shall accompany me. - Who, me? Yeah well, I mean sure, but I mean, why not? - [Both] Well, off we go. - I'm a washed up witch, a faded flower. Look at me. Here it is Halloween and not one call, and I've been waiting all day. It wasn't always like this for me. Back in the old days, I was a star! In demand. I turned princes into frogs twice a week. I could grant every wicked wish in the book. See this magic wand? Magic power going to waste. Watch this. (cat screeching) Wonderful varmints! (laughing) Now nobody wants me. Halloween and I'm unemployed. Please, somebody call. (knocking) Hark. - Boy, look at this dump. It's really rotten. - A total wreck, an absolute disaster. What a run down mess. - [Rotten] No one's been here for years. It's perfect. - [Goodly] We'll put the stereo over there. - [Rotten] Yeah. - [Goodly] The food over there. - [Rotten] Yeah yeah. - We'll clear a big dancing space. - Yeah. - And we're all set. - Yeah. - Why bless my black-legged bloomers, a party! Oh, I'm having a party tonight! Just you wait my darlings, till you meet your gracious hostess. (laughing) (scary organ music) - Come on, Small, we'll scare them all. - Oh yeah! - Trick or treat! - Why it's Small and Tender. Oh, don't you look cute. - Cute? - Did you hear that? - Cute. (growling) - [Small And Tender] Trick or treat! - My, my, Small and Tender. Here's a little something for you. - Gee, Small, this is awful. - It's the pits. - [Small And Tender] Trick or treat, smell my feet, give me something good to eat. - Well, well, look who's here, Small and Tender. Oh, I'm so scared. Here, have one of my famous party hors d'oeuvres. - What are they? - What are they? - Sardine meringue. - Oh that's yucky! - Eww! - They're an acquired taste, you little brats. - Guess who? Small and Tender. Lookin' for handouts? - Here's some for you, too, sonny. What kind of monster are you? - Don't get smart with me, Malicious. - Don't worry, you'll be the last to know. Now help me carry the rest of this food. Look out, Rotten, you're squishing the pepperoni peppermint. - Halloween isn't any fun. We didn't scare anybody. - Everybody recognized us. They all know who we were. - Guess who's your babysitter tonight? - Bazooey, Bazooey! - Are you gonna read us a story, huh? - A story, oh please! - Oh sure, how 'bout a spooky Halloween story? - Hooey, I'm fed up with Halloween. - It's boring. - Oh, oh okay. Well, here's one about a fairy godmother. - [Tender] Okay, good. - Now this fairy godmother lived in a beautiful castle with a shimmering gold roof and diamond windows. - Oh my audience arrives. Welcome, darlings, to a performance fraught with fearful frights. I'll turn the pumpkin pie into spider stew. I'll turn the taffy apples into lizards. I'll transform the hors d'oeuvres into hopping toads. - Hey, interesting. - Great idea, eh? - Boy, you don't see staircases like this. - They just don't put that kinda work into things anymore. - And the fairy godmother turned the frog into a handsome prince, and they lived happily ever after. - Gee, Bazooey, we could've used a fairy godmother tonight. - We got all dressed up and didn't scare anybody. If we had a fairy godmother, she could change me into a real ghost. - And a real wolf man. - Well, there's really no such thing as a fairy godmother. - I wish I could be a real wolf man. - I wish I could be a real ghost. - [Small] I wish I could be a real wolf man. - [Tender] I wish I could be a real ghost. - [Small] I wish I could be a real wolf man. - A call, a call. My word, two engagements on the same evening. Don't go away, people, I shall return. (engine humming) (glass shattering) Ta da! - [Small] A fairy godmother! - Fairy godmother my foot! That's a wicked witch. - So okay, I ain't the Avon lady. I just know I heard the Halloween wishes of little children. Someone wants to be a real wolf man. Now who might that be, hmm? - Me, me! Can I be a real wolf man, please, please? - No, Small, don't do it. - Butt out, pal, can't you see the kid's got a real need here? Very well, young man, prepare to have your wish come true. - No, no! - Yes, yes! - [Witch] Happy Halloween, Small. (growling) - Hey, neat! Look at me, look at me! - Gee, Small, that's terrific. Can I be a real ghost, please, please, please? - No, no! - Yes, yes! - Steady, my dear, as I utilize the power of my magic wand. (engine humming) - [Small] Yippee, Tender! - Stop, stop, I'm the babysitter! How am I gonna explain this? - Will you relax? Watch an old pro here. You see? Harmless amusement. What could go wrong, hmm? Tell me, my boy, what's your name? - Bazooey. - Bazooey, what would you really, really like to be on this scary old Halloween night? - Oh gosh, oh jeepers. Holy mackerel, I don't know, I don't know. Oh, I want to be a Frankenstein monster. - What an inspired choice. This will be a personal triumph. - [Small And Tender] Oh, do me again! (growling and grunting) - Now, darlings, allow me to extend to you a most cordial invitation to this evening's festivities. Come to my party. - A Halloween party? - It's just about to become one. (engine humming) - Nice party. - How you been? - Yeah. - Fine, fine. - What are you doing these days? - Oh, same old thing. - If the coach had called a kick, they would've won the game. (party guests chattering) - And now, a dazzling display of magical mischief. (gagging) - Nicely passed out. - Already? - The food. - Just like Malicious. Trust Malicious. - Just a ding darn minute. I put a lot of effort into these peanut butter corn beef balls, chocolate gefilte fish. Take my garlic taffy apples. (howling) - Hey, maybe this place is haunted. - What? (growling) - [Crowd] Monster! (screaming) Monster! - [Party guest] Get me out of here. (screaming) - And now for a dazzling display of magical mischief. (screaming) (groaning) I may be poor, but this is the first time I've been downtrodden. (laughing) Oh, did you see them go? Oh, my devastated body. We scared them out of their minds. What a riot. - Everybody was scared of us. - Gee, nobody knew who we were. - My sweethearts. - The party's over before anybody had any fun. I guess if you scare people they tend to avoid you, you know. - Yes, but you don't-- - I don't think I want to scare people anymore. - Yes-- - Yeah, well listen, I gotta get these little kids back home again. So if you please turn us back to us again. - Yes, but oh come, come, darling. We just started. The climax of the evening, oh hang on a second. I seem to have mislaid something here. I just don't see it right handy. Dear, oh dear. Some rat stole my magic wand! - [All] You mean we have to stay like this? - Oh, but my little dears, you look wonderful. - We won't be able to relate to others. - Even mommy and daddy. - I wanna go home. (crowd chattering) - You see those monsters? - Incredible. - Horrifying. - Terrible. - Small and Tender and Bazooey are missing. - I'll bet the monsters got them. - Small and Tender and Bazooey? - The monsters! - Small and Tender! - We're not safe! - Malicious, you got something sorta stuck in your head there. - Looks like some kinda magic wand. - Okay, keep it down. Over here. This could be the real thing, baby. Try it out. - What am I supposed to do? Abra-cadabra? Bing bong booey? - Try something, make a wish. - What do you want, what do you want? - [Rotten] I'm starvin'. - Hocus pocus, give me a maraschino liver burger. - Wow, an old gym sock. That's pretty close. Try again, come on, try again. - Don't push me! Sis-boom-bah, gimme a roast turkey with tuna and raisin stuffing smothered in whipped cream and ketchup. - I told ya, you're gettin' the hang of it now. It's a bag of garbage. Great, great! - It's all my fault. Why if it hadn't been for me, this catastrophe would never have taken place. - Oh, you mustn't blame yourself, Goodly. You can be the leader you really are. - Leader? - I know in my heart that underneath it all, those are not bad monsters. If we could just talk to them. - Leader. - They need help and love and understanding so that they can be rehabilitated back into society. - You're right, Nicely. We will strike back. - What, no. - Listen my friends! Listen! Quiet, everybody! Now I know we're besieged by mysterious and terrifying monsters that have already taken three of our young people, but talk will not help us now. We need action. We must organize, pull together, rally our courage, strengthen our hearts, and pursue these frightful creatures to the end. We'll make this world safe for our families, for society, for democracy, for the civilizations of the world! - Let's go get the monsters and rescue the children! - [Witch] Look, all we gotta do is find out who stole my magic wand. Which, my darlings, is not going to be as difficult as you might at first suppose. Uh oh, I don't like the looks of this. - What's going on? - Come on, there's monsters on the rampage! We're gonna track 'em down. Help, monsters, monsters! Here they are! - Here they are! - After them! - Head for the woods! - Monsters, I don't even know these people! - Onward! - This way. (crowd shouting) (breathing heavily) - Forget that food, greedy guts. What I want is money. - We'll be rich! We'll be rich! - I'll turn that into a hunk of pure gold. Alakazam! - You're gettin' there, you're really cookin'. Try over here. Turn it into a pile of money. - Abra-Cadabra! - Come on, we wanna get rich! - Rotten, this is a rotten idea. - My magic wand appears. Let's go. - The monsters! - After them! - You don't know nothin'. Gimme that! Kazammy, kazowy, cockamamie! (gasping) - The monsters! - Come to mama. Mess with my magic wand, huh? - In here. Shh. (laughing) - Please, Miss Witch, you have to understand. We're just ordinary people and, well, these kids, I'm responsible for them. I just have to get the real Tender and the real Small back home. Don't get me wrong, we've had a great time, but a person just can't go around being something he's not. And besides, things have really gotten out of hand. - Please, turn us back. - We wanna go home. - Uh oh. - [All] Yay! - Oh, thank you, Miss Witch. - Thank you, Mrs. Witch. - Thank you, fairy godmother. - They come in through here! - They're down that way! (screaming) - Stop! - Hey, it's Bazooey! - And Small and Tender! - They're okay. - Fear not, young people, you're safe now. Intrepidly striving in the face of terrible danger, we have overcome and captured these dreadful, disgusting monsters that have terrorized this town. - Those aren't monsters. - That's Rotten. - And that's Malicious. - Huh? - What? - What's happening? - What's going on? - This is an outrage! - I demand an explanation. - This has gone past a joke. Look at the mess. - Who is responsible? Someone's to blame for this. - Oh boy, let me out of here. I don't know why I bother in the first place. What a fizzle. Halloween, stick it in your ear, dear. People got no appreciation these days. Maybe it's me, I don't know. (applauding) - And now for a dazzling display of magical monstrosity! - Bazooey, you're alright. - [Small And Tender] Do me, do me! - With pleasure, my sweets. This is what Halloween is all about, my darlings. Every day we go about our lives in the same old way, but once a year we can be whatever and whoever we please. Pretend, let your secret fancies run wild. Now you, my dear, what would you like to become for one little night, hmm? - Well, if it wouldn't be any trouble. - Trouble? - Then I'd like to be, I would really like to be-- - Go on, dearie, yes. - A vampire. (growling) - [Witch] And you, sir? - Well Ma, you know, she always hoped I'd be a saint, but-- - [Witch] An answer to a mother's prayer. - Bless you, dear lady. - Could I be a fairy princess? - [Witch] A veritable Tinkerbell. - I want to be Attila the Hun. - Make me a devil. - I want to be a movie star. - I want to be a cowboy. - Make me a queen! - I want to be a hairdresser. - I want to be an astronaut. - I want to be a hockey puck. - I want to be a cowboy. - I love you, my dears, come to my humble mansion and I'll turn everybody on! * If you're stuck inside and you can't get out * But you feel like being free * Grab a witch and make a switch * And see what you can be * That's Halloween witch magic * Halloween * Halloween witch magic * Halloween * Halloween * Halloween witch magic * Halloween, Halloween, Halloween * Halloween witch magic * Halloween, Halloween, Halloween * Halloween witch magic * Halloween, Halloween, Halloween * Halloween witch magic (meowing) (electronic music)
