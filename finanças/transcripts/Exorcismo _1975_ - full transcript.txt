Watch out. I saw death. I know. dear. Don't worry. She's coming out of shock. and she's only suffered bruises. It's nothing important. She'll spend a couple of days under observation in the clinic. Then she'll be able to go home without any problems. Thank God. Are you sure you're telling me the truth? Patricia. I have no reason to lie. I don't know. When I saw her. I noticed something very strange in her. Traumatology is not my speciality. you know. But I trust Dr. Warren. Mother, I think you're overreacting. Doesn't the doctor say that Leila is fine? Your mother must understand that it would be pointless to lie to her. Can I see her? Yes. but only for a moment. Wait. Richard. What is it? You weren't at any birthday party, and you didn't meet at a classmates house. You had an accident because you were on drugs - yes or no? Ask your sister as soon as you can. She was the one who was driving. You're destroying her, Richard. Since you came back from Africa, Leila hasn't been the same. Perhaps not. We have all changed a little. I ask you to forget about her. to leave her alone. My dear John. never stand in the way of two people who love each other. That has bad consequences. Even so. I'll do whatever I can to make her leave you. You're a good man. I wouldn't want to have you as an enemy. That's all I wanted to say. Tum on the light. miss. Come closer. I don't want to see anybody. But. Leila. I'm your mother. Everyone leave. - Leave me alone. - Quick. A dose of Librium. Don't touch me. Get out. Calm down. Leila. I said don't touch me. Leave me. Get out. Listen to me. Leila. Reverend. Mr. Gibson is here to see you. Thank you. Ronald. Show him to my office. - Hello, John. - How are you, Reverend? Very well. Go on, continue reading. It's an extraordinary piece from the reign of Henry VIII. When our church still depended on Rome. It's an intriguing piece. But you have so many. That's my hobby, collecting things of value. Come, sit down. I'll make you some tea. It's been a while since you came to our house. You're right. I deserve a reprimand. How are your mother and your sisters? - That's what I wanted to talk about. - ls something wrong? - Leila. - What's wrong with her? I wouldn't know how to explain. She had an accident recently. Nothing too serious. or so it would seem. But she's changing. Actually, she's been changing since she got engaged to Richard Harrington. You know him, don't you? Of course I know him. He was my student in high school. If I remember correctly. he and Leila met each other there. Richard was a terrific student. He graduated as an archaeologist, first in his class. And I know he went to Egypt to work on his thesis. I got him a job as an assistant at my university. Could you talk to him? To Richard? About what? He may listen to you. I don't want him to go back to Leila. I have a feeling they take drugs and frequent heretic circles. That's a very strong accusation, John. I know. But I'm convinced. I don't have conclusive evidence, but I could swear Richard introduced Leila to the ideas he brought from Africa. She was on drugs when the accident happened. You should have seen her. Adrian. She's not the same person. How has she changed? She rebels against everybody. Sometimes she's gone for days, and when she comes back, she doesn't give explanations. And Mother tolerates everything. She even forbids me from saying anything to her. Leila was always difficult. And you know how kids are today. We don't always like their concept of freedom. But that doesn't mean it isn't sometimes justified. Then my visit was useless. No. I'll talk to Leila. but I'm afraid all this is just a fantasy. I'll find out soon. I plan to watch them constantly. I'm almost sure you're wrong. I hope you're right. I don't want to bother you anymore. I'll send the car to pick you up tomorrow at 11. - But-- - I'm sorry. You must come. I'm glad to see you again. Thank you, Christian. How's your wife? She's fine. Father. Come. Miss Patricia is waiting for you. John told me you would come. You look the same as the last time we saw each other. - Want something to drink? - Sure. some sherry. I see you haven't changed your habits. You have to keep them if they're not too bad. By the way - I have asked myself a lot lately. Why did you stop coming here? To be honest. I stopped coming the day I thought my presence was no longer welcome. But how can you say that? You've always been welcome here. For more than two years, you've been our spiritual adviser. Reason enough to be disliked, don't you think? I'm sorry, Patricia. I was joking. The truth is I haven't come because I'm too busy. Really. An implausible excuse. I'm here because John came to my house yesterday and told me about Leila. What did he tell you? Well. that you had some problems. Problems? John is the problem. I don't know why he bothers my daughter. He keeps asking her questions and trying to put obstacles in the way of her seeing Richard. You know Richard well? But John is not acting that way for no reason. He wants the best for his sister. and it's normal for him to worry. But John has no reason to oppose her relationship with Richard. I know my daughter, and also John and Deborah. But John - John is bitter. He has no friends. And it bothers him that others enjoy themselves and are happy. He spends his days looked up in his greenhouse with his plants. John is a good boy. Patricia. even if you think otherwise. Perhaps the fact that you're his stepmother has come between you. I love all three of them the same. I don't make any distinctions. No one knows that better than you. Can I say hello to Leila? Of course. She's in the pool with some friends. Do you want to follow me? Bork, come on, let's go. Here. Next to me. Reverend. what a surprise. Yes, it's a little strange that we meet at a swimming pool, I'm glad to see you after all this time. The university and the Vicarage take up all my time. But you don't come to visit me either. And the same goes for Deborah. I haven't seen her in ages. There she is. Call her. - You play for me. You have two lovely daughters, Patricia. My dear Mr. Dunning. You've made yourself a stranger. - God forbid. - Will you stay for dinner? Some other time. Go, your friends are calling you. Come, come with us. - See you soon, Reverend. Leila. they're calling you too. I heard. Bork. you see this gentleman? Well. I hate him. I hate him for the bad times he's given me translating the classics. How ridiculous. It's alright. She's only telling the truth. By the way. I was expecting to see your fiancé here. He's your fiancé, isn't he? I'm coming. I'm sorry. Father. - I have to go. Now you see that she's perfectly fine. That's how it seems. And I also see that Deborah is very happy. They both are. They both are. I can't say the same about myself. I've never felt so lonely. so depressed. Since Lawrence's illness, everything has gone wrong. My situation is truly unbearable. I try to hide it with great dignity. But there's a point where I can't pretend anymore. I didn't know about your problems. John didn't tell me about that. I told you. John isn't considerate. He doesn't take care of anything. I have to face it all. There you have it. I don't want to sell the house. I refuse, but I'll have to do it. Everything is abandoned. falling apart. And on top of that. I have these problems with my children - well, with Lawrence's children. Where's John? Where do you think? In his damned greenhouse. You know the way, don't you? At the end of the garden. I've been there before. Before we say goodbye. I want you to tell me something. Tell me. What worries you about Leila is her background. is that correct? You mean your husband's problems? John talked about very different things. I just wanted to know that. Please. John. Christian must be looking for me. Then why did you come here? I hadn't seen you in several hours. You promised to help me. Sandra. Yes, John. I'll help you. I love you. - They're going to see us. - Did you speak to Leila? - I just said hello, and she seemed perfectly well. She's a paranoiac. She knows how to pretend. Patricia is very worried about you. She's lying. She thinks you're mad, that you don't help her, that you're aggressive. I know what she thinks of me. She thinks I only want to bother Leila and make them all miserable. That's not true, I swear. It seems that Richard stopped seeing your sister. I made sure of that. - What plant is this? - Don't touch it. - What's wrong? - It's very poisonous. Well, I didn't realise that one could risk one's life in a greenhouse. It's a Maliferum Magnus. I'll be more careful from now on. According to what my stepmother told you. Neither Deborah nor I mean anything to her. Leila is the only one that counts for her. And things will go on that way till I show her just who her dear daughter is. I think you're obsessed with this. It's better to forget about it. She convinced you. Your visit was useless. Yes, John. At least we got to know each other better. Come and see me another day, and we'll talk again. I'll come when I have concrete evidence. I know you'll listen to me then. Where are you going. Leila? I'm an adult. I don't have to explain everything to you. Are you going to see him? I'm getting tired of this. Don't you understand that he's not good for you? He's vicious. A drug addict. And you, John? What are you? Why don't you take off that damned puritan mask? Or do you think I don't know where you spend many nights? Don't worry. You needn't fear. I can keep a secret. But listen, John. Don't interfere with my life. Please don't. It's a wonderful day. How was golf? How did you do? So-so. I hit well today. but my putting was awful. I must say Pamela was inspired. If she hadn't been, we would've lost. Anyway, I think we'll reach the finals. By the way, I saw our friend Dr. Levvton at the club. He said he'd come by. Yes, I talked to him. Are you worried? ls something wrong? Your brother is beginning to alarm me. It's the same old story. I see him more or less the same. He's like that. He didn't sleep in his room last night. His bed is untouched, and he hasn't appeared yet. I looked in the garage. but he didn't take his car. He's not in the greenhouse either. I don't know what to think. He'll be home, don't worry. And Leila? She's still sleeping. Well. it's about time she got up. I'm going for a swim. Let me know when lunch is ready. I'm starving. Who is it? We ask you, Lord, to forgive the soul of John Gibson... who was taken from our side... leaving open a painful wound in the memories of all of us who knew him. We ask you, Omnipotent Lord, To absolve his soul from every sin so that in the glorious resurrection he can live eternally among your chosen ones. Rest in peace. Shall I serve you. miss? Shameless. disgusting whore. Come here. Bitch. What's going on? Let her go. Leave me. My little girl. My God, poor child. What did they do to you? We'll end up going mad in this house after what happened. - We should leave. - Be quiet Abigail. please. You always talk more than you should. - Is lunch ready? - Not yet, soon. - Is that right, Abigail? - We'll let you know when it's ready. I'll be in my room. He's so obnoxious. He didn't even ask what happened to the girl. Let him be. He doesn't bother anybody. Don't move. sweetheart. I saw John here in my room. He was cursing me. He tried to strangle me. - Deborah. help me. Call the doctor. Have him come immediately. No! I don't want to see that charlatan. I don't want to see him. But, dear, you're sick. He'll help you. You won't take me away from here. I know what that doctor wants. He wants to lock me up in his clinic and forget about me. That's what he wants. No, Levvton only wants to make you well again. Levvton. your dear Dr. Lewton. His name makes your mouth water. You like him, don't you? Come on, Mrs Gibson. What do you mean? - You don't fool me, hypocrite. - Leila, control yourself. And you shut up. Go to your club to have fun with your stupid friends. That's what you like, isn't it? Well, go and leave me alone. I want to be alone. Leave immediately. - I heard voices and - - Go on. - Can I talk to you. Father? - Come in. How is everything at home? After John's death, I can't say that things are fine. That's natural. Time has to pass for the wounds to heal. John's death isn't the only thing. It's Leila. She's still acting strange? She's sick. Really sick. It didn't seem that way when I talked to her. She's quite ill. Your friend, Dr. Buchanan, is a good psychiatrist. What does he think? Leila won't allow any doctor to visit her. No one has been able to convince her. - Has her boyfriend visited her? - No. He hasn't even called. So they broke up. She refuses to talk about it. but... It's obvious that something's wrong between them. We're probably overreacting. It wouldn't surprise me if your sister's condition was due to depression caused by John's death and by her problems with Richard. I'm here to ask for your help. I know you'll do it. Your brother asked me something similar, and I wasn't successful. But we'll try again. and this time. we'll attack the problem at its source. - What are you going to do? - I'm going to call Richard. Who is it? Adrian. the tedious Adrian Dunning. You weren't expecting me to call, isn't that right? No, I really wasn't thinking about you. What's wrong? I'd like to see you and talk with you. Is this afternoon convenient? I warn you, if you want to discuss Leila. You're wasting your time. Are you sure? I want to forget her. I've suffered too much because of her. I'll see him anyway. Don't worry. You can be sure that I'll do everything I can. Come on. Bork. Get me the police. Mr. Dunning. you say that you used to see Richard Harrington often. Yes. He was a student of mine, and we were good friends. When he graduated, I recommended him as an assistant archaeologist at the university which, as you know, I'm a professor. Weren't you a friend of the other victim, John Gibson? I've known the Gibsons for many years. and I used to see John frequently. I understand that the late Harrington was dating the youngest daughter of the Gibsons. ls that correct? I believe so. Well, Reverend, I don't want to detain you any longer. You may go. You say you were injured by someone who pushed you down the stairs when you were going to Harrington's study? I think I already told you. It was someone wearing a mask. If you're going to leave town, let me know. I may need you again. Don't worry. Inspector. I'm not thinking about travelling right now. He seems strong. Yes. he was a good athlete when he was a student. But I don't think he was the one who strangled the victims. I've been selfish, Lewton. Sometimes I think that everything that has happened has been my fault. I haven't been a good mother. It seems you've talked with Father Dunning. Is that true? I'm sorry. Here. This is the sedative that you need to give Leila. Read the instructions. What's going to happen when she finds out about Richard's death? For now, you have to do what you can to prevent her finding out. It could be risky. You can try, but only if you take every precaution. I had thought that Perhaps Father Dunning could take care of it. He has helped us so much recently. Yes, that could be a solution. Has the Inspector returned? Yes, he questioned Udo and the maid again. This situation is unbearable. believe me. I know. Patricia. I know. But everything will be all right, you'll see. I don't want to keep bothering you. Thank you for everything. - I'll come by to see you tonight. - Fine. They told you to come and see me. To see how I was getting along, am I right? 'They', as you call them, are your mother and your sister. And they're worried about you. They are two stupid women whom I despise. I plan to amuse myself, preferably at their expense. They say I'm perverse, and I'm going to prove it. You certainly are not the girl I knew. But you don't have to try to impress me. These flowers seem to tremble when I touch them. Sometimes I think the spirit of poor John took refuge in them. He was so happy here. He loved them so much. You don't love anybody anymore. do you? You only want to hurt those that love you. Your mother, Deborah. You're forgetting one name: Richard. Richard is dead. Did he poison himself? He was murdered. Richard was a weak person. He was fearful. He wasn't sophisticated enough for me to love him. You're different. You're strong. Very strong. Richard's death didn't affect me at all. And just so you can see. you're invited to my birthday party. I hope you don't miss it. If you think I can be useful. I'll be there. She has responded well to the treatment. I'm not expecting a relapse. I'm afraid her illness may be more than merely psychological. What do you mean? Sometimes the soul becomes sick as well. Well. the priest in you comes out at last. I can't help it. Are you having fun? - And you? - I'm having a great time. I'm glad. See you later. How nice. Pigs. Garbage. What are you doing here. laughing and talking nonsense? Don't you remember poor John? Have you already forgotten about him, mother? And you, dear sister. You make me sick. All of you. All of you make me sick. I hate you. - Open the door. Wait here. Listen. Leila. Go away. Leave me alone. You all disgust me. I only want your well-being. You used to trust me before. Leave! I don't want your help. Hold her legs. Yes? What is it. Udo? Miss Leila is worse. wouldn't you say? A lot worse. - I'm afraid she is. - Of course. They don't leave her alone. They follow her and make her suffer. What are you saying? All we want is for her to get better and be the way she was before. Mr. John used to say the same. And all he did was torment her. Once, he insulted her. I heard him. He called her a whore. I had to contain myself not to- Please. Udo. John is dead. and he deserves to be respected. He wasn't any good. He didn't love anybody. He hated Bork, the dog. He used to hit him. And whoever is capable of doing that to an animal has no heart. Udo, I'd appreciate it if we stopped talking about this. I don't like it. You must accept reality. To leave her alone without any supervision like we have done until now... could be dangerous. What are you trying to say? It hurts me to tell you. There's only one way. Commit her to an institution. Leila is not mad. And I'll never take her to one of those horrible places. How could you ask me to do this? Don't you understand? You know I'm not talking nonsense. She could have inherited it. Father died in a mental hospital. completely mad. And you didn't hesitate to send him there. Have you forgotten about that? It was necessary. He was very ill at the end. He tried to kill me, and all of you as well. It was horrible. But Leila is not mad. Dr. Lewton told me it's just a nervous breakdown. She'll get better. I'm sorry. Sometimes I say things I shouldn't. I'm sorry. People are getting more insane every day, Reverend. Want some? I say that because three fellows went completely naked into a girls school a few days ago. What do you think? It's wrong. I think it's wrong. Well. those three individuals went through the classrooms creating chaos - you know. this streaking business. Fortunately, we could stop them. And here's the funny thing. Well, actually, it's not that funny. One of them was the father of one of the students. He was protesting because. according to him. His daughter was not getting a proper education. You tell me. It doesn't seem very educational. But I imagine that you didn't come here to talk to me about streaking. I was just giving you an example of how unhinged people are today. Yes. Reverend. In this materialistic and consumerist era there are those who get together to invoke Satan. There are black masses, covens, and other things. Obviously, it's a pretext to consume drugs and give themselves over to sexual excess. It's really a racket, organised by a few people getting rich off it. But unfortunately, there are a few fanatics who commit crimes. Ritual crimes. On Witchcraft by Bodin. Lash for the Demon by Dengo. Pseudo-Monarchy of the Devils by Agrippa. Interesting books. And I imagine they are hard to find. Very hard. I am, Reverend - how should I say it? - a very modest amateur of occultism, witchcraft, and whatever else. I have a subscription to a few monthly magazines. I read that this way of killing, by twisting the victim's neck, was used by Satan himself to eliminate the witches who proved unfaithful to him. - Is that correct? - Yes. That's what they say in those books. But what's your point, Inspector? Why are you telling me this? It's simple. I want you to help me. You quite erudite in the matter. And I suspect that the killings of John Gibson and Richard Harrington were ritual crimes. They probably belonged to one of those circles. That's absurd. I knew them well. Are you sure? Well, listen to this, Father Dunning. Richard Harrington was drugged when he was murdered. He had taken LSD. I can show you the autopsy report. It's not necessary. He was partial to drugs ever since returned from Africa. A research trip, I believe. I suppose you know that lately some churches have been desecrated. I know. It has to be someone who is very disturbed. Someone who is insane. Or perhaps a renegade priest. A Priest? No, I don't think so. I think anybody can commit a crime. I'm going to show you something I found. I'm sure you'll be interested. Come with me. Look. I would appreciate it if you didn't tell the Gibsons. Don't worry. They won't find out. I've talked to other doctors. And nobody understands the nature of the illness. The symptoms are very strange. They don't fit any clinical explanation. They have never heard of a case like this one. And what if my sister suffers from more than a mental illness? - You too? - I don't understand. Another person said the same thing. Would you tell me precisely to what you're referring? I know it will seem absurd, but sometimes I think that my sister is possessed. Possessed? It's as if someone, an evil force, had taken control of her. I know it's monstrous to think it, but - Listen, Deborah. You're not serious, are you? Because if you are, you're the one in need of psychiatric treatment. I'm sorry. Yes, what I said was stupid. I'm so worried. I'll do it. So. my little sweet one. That's good. That's the best. It was the voice of a man. An unmistakable voice. because it was his. It was Lawrence. You say that when you came into the room she was sleeping soundly? Yes. She was covered in sweat. But the room was terribly cold. And there was an awful smell. It stank like rotten meat. Was she still asleep when you left her? Yes. She seemed to be in a deep sleep. Let's go. Come with us. Patricia. I want to see her. “Come. Leonard. Possess once more my excited body.“ ls that her handwriting? I don't know. It's possible. A little changed. perhaps. but it could be her handwriting. Does Leila know German? Not a single word. What do you think about all this? Nothing. Nothing definitive. Let's get out of here. Miss Deborah, we checked everywhere. She isn't anywhere. Ma'am, I think we should call the police. Would you approve? Not yet. They would ask questions. I couldn't stand it. Thank you. you can go. We'll call you if we need you. Mother, the Reverend and I will look for Leila. We'll find her, you'll see. Patricia, try to rest. Whenever you're ready. Don't be surprised by what I'm about to tell you. - I think I know where Leila is. - Where? - In an abandoned castle near Ansy. - And what is she doing there? Richard initiated her into Satanism. She and other students meet there often. Not always in the same place. Sometimes they meet at the beach. other times in that castle. And how do you know all that? One of Leila's classmates came to tell me. She knows my sister is ill, and she blames those meetings. Can I talk to this girl? No. I promised I wouldn't give her name to anyone. She's very frightened. She's afraid the police will get involved and she'll get embroiled in a scandal. - Did you say the ruins of the Ansy castle? Then what are we waiting for? Let's go. It must be there. Let him go! Let him go. The police. Damned pigs. Leave me alone. Don't touch me. Reverend. what are they going to do with Udo? I don't know. He's under arrest for now. They'll never let him go, will they? I don't know. First, they will have to judge him and prove that he's guilty. He killed John, Mr. John. And also Miss Leila's boyfriend. He hated them. He was in love with her. He used to take her to those meetings. and he made her sick. He killed John because he was afraid he would find out. And he killed Mr. Richard because he was jealous. But I watched him constantly. until I discovered his madness. Now they will convict him, and I'll keep my promise to John. He'll be avenged. My child, only hatred makes you speak this way. But you're a good girl. You must take pity on him. No, Reverend. I'll never pity him. Never. I don't understand. Leila doesn't have any drugs in her body. And the electroencephalogram shows no fluctuation. Her state seems to be normal. But she's hallucinating, and she frequently loses consciousness. However, it's not a case of hysteria. No. it isn't. Look, Reverend. I'm a sceptic in religious matters. Perhaps because I'm a sceptic by nature. I understand. Well, I'll admit something that goes against my beliefs. I'm listening. I don't accept anything that is not tangible. However, I'm starting to have my doubts. I'm talking about those manifestations of the beyond. You know what I mean. Spirits, apparitions, and... And demonic possessions. Exactly. Deborah believes in that. And Patricia is starting to believe it. And now you want to know what I think about that, isn't that right? I'm anxious to know what you think. You're an expert in that subject. Well. A few years ago, I assisted an exorcist in Brazil. The case had all the characteristics of possession. The girl wrote and spoke languages completely unknown to her. I remember she would have moments of wild rage. And then she would have strange lethargies. She also suffered from alterations of her physique and stigmata on her flesh. It was horrible. The point is that the girl was cured. The priest who conducted the exorcism was convinced that he had expelled a malign spirit from her body. I never believed that. I thought it was all in her mind. due to either hypnosis or drugs. And what about Leila? Regarding Leila, we know she has been to those heretic circles. She was probably fooled. She was an ideal subject. and she fell into the trap. That's what I believe. But there have been times when apparent demonic possession was frequent. Are you talking about the Medieval witches? They were almost always hysterical young women. Victims of their own ignorance and the ignorance of others. I've also read about Urbain Grandier and the Ursulines of Loudun. And also about Nicole Aubry, "The Demoniac of Vervins," and Louise Lateau, "The Belgian Stigmatic." Were you sincere when you said you only cared for tangible things. Well, I did my research to be able to discuss this with you. You can't deny they are very interesting cases. You scientists would classify these cases as hysteria-epilepsy, catalepsy, somnambulism... etc. Probably. But the truth is, the Gibson family trusts more in you than in medicine. That doesn't surprise me. Where science can't go, faith may have a place. Perhaps. Yes. I did it. I killed those pigs. I had to free her from them because her brother was torturing her. How? He watched her every step. He kept asking her questions. And why did you kill Harrington? He wasn't worthy of her. What was your motive? Because I love her. Yes. I love her. And I couldn't allow that type to put his dirty hands on her body. I had to kill them. I had to do it. Take him. We'll continue with the interrogation later. Don't think you'll get another word from me. Take him away. 'The evil spirit can also enter the body of an animal. turning the most docile creature into a fierce beast that will try to exterminate the man wherever it finds him. But this will only be a temporary refuge for the devil. since the human creature is always the desired prey' Leonard. I've come from the Gibsons'. I'm listening. Do you know there is news? - Perhaps about Leila? - No. she's more or less the same. But Sandra, the maid, has disappeared. The strange thing is she left all her things behind. And the suitcase only half-packed. Indeed. It does seem strange. Although lately she seemed a little disturbed. She talked to me in a strange way yesterday. This business with the chauffeur really affected her. So you spoke to Sandra? - Very interesting. - I don't find it that interesting. You like to exaggerate things to confuse those you interrogate. That's right, that's one of our tricks. I have to admit it. Do you know that Udo Kleine admitted killing John Gibson and Richard Harrington? What? He confessed before he killed himself. You didn't know that either? I didn't. His death solves the case almost entirely. The confession was made according to the rules. But something clouds the matter. The disappearance of the maid. There are many confusing elements. Many loose ends. Don't you think so? What do I know? You're the policeman. True. Well, I have a strange theory that's Fantastic. But it's an idea I'm obsessed with. And I have something to do with it? In a way. Let's say that behind all this there's a powerful mind. Someone with certain capabilities. like, for example, To be able to hypnotise. Someone capable of using telepathy and of inducing certain individuals to perform specific actions. It's not likely someone like that exists. I talked with Dr. Lewton Buchanan, and he doesn't rule it out. He'll have his reasons. I don't believe so. You have some very interesting qualities. I've read your essays about hypnosis and more. You have to know a lot about the subject to be able to write about it. You overestimate me, Inspector. No, I'm simply being honest. Then you think I can be, let's say... involved in something so terrible? I told you, it's only a theory. That's all. Well, Reverend. You'll have to excuse me. Wait a minute. Inspector. About your theory. I don't think you're completely wrong. I also believe there's someone with certain qualities behind all this. But that someone is much more powerful than you think. Some rampant demon? Why not? Yes? What? Go and rest. I'm perfectly fine. No, Leila. I'd rather stay with you. And what if I ask you to please go? It makes me nervous to see you watching me. It's passed now, Deborah. You have to listen to me. All right. I'll go. I'm glad you're well now. Very glad. Beloved Leonard... my darling... my master. I love you. I love you. Come... my master. 'The exorcist should not conclude someone is possessed by any evil until he has made sure that the possessed is not really mentally ill.' The dirty bitch. You're not my daughter. You locked me up in that mental hospital and left me there to rot while you went to bed with that disgusting little doctor. Lewton Buchanan. That's not true. It's true, damned whore. How many others were there? How many? Lawrence! You're Lawrence. l am Leonard. You're nothing, little whore. Nothing. Help me. Move away. Don't put your dirty hands on me. I am Lawrence. I am your husband. Had you forgotten about me. dissolute whore? Help me. It's impossible. All right. I'll be there right away. Where are they? In the living room. They're waiting for you. Adrian! It was horrible. She wanted to kill us all. And she looked horrible. Yes. I know. I know. Patricia. Christian told me everything. You shouldn't wait anymore. You have to do it. She's possessed. Do you know what's required to perform an exorcism? I cant do it if there's any doubt that the possessed is mentally ill. That's not Leila's case. I can assure you. - Do you want to see her? But I would rather go by myself. Tell me. This being inside my daughter - what does it want? What is it looking for? Why? Why did he tum her into something so... so heinous? Why? It's hard to answer that. Perhaps Leila is not what he wants, but us. He wants to create hatred. to disorient us. To make us look filthy and stained. The terrible thing is that if Leila continues like this. She'll die very soon. Reverend, you have to try. I want you to leave me alone with her. Go to Dr. Buchanan's house. I'll call you once everything is done. And if you can't do it? I'll have lost the battle. But I'll win. I'm a man of faith. So it's you. Poor Bork. Nobody remembers you. Wait. I'll release you. Hallucinations. Listen, bastard. We face each other again. But you won't make me leave. I'm very happy in the whore's body. You are a loser, filthy spirit, and you will lose again. Listen, Adrian. I'm John. She killed us. Sandra, Richard, and me. Don't make me leave. I don't have anywhere to go. No, you're not John. You're the spirit of evil. And I will defeat you. You know that I have the strength of faith in me. I'm Udo Kleine. I killed myself because of her. I confessed her crimes. I protected her. And now all I have is her body to give me refuge. Don't make me leave. Vile demon. You won't trick me. She didn't commit those murders. It was you. Because only you are inside her. You're right, and I won't leave her body. Until she dies. I am nobody. Do you understand? Nobody. I'm nobody. You're the same as always, the one who again and again seeks to wipe out the good. And love. And justice. Leave her body. Leave her. I command you! I speak to you in the name of God and by virtue of His power. Which is greater than all creation. In His great name. I command you to abandon immediately the body of this servant of God and to never have the audacity to come back to it. You, monarch of criminals. You. source of everything obscene. You, king of evil, ancient serpent. Crawl like one back to your everlasting solitude. You have not surrendered. But this will be your final refuge.
