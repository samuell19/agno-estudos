Man: Perhaps this is not the only world. Perhaps for every world where the coin came up heads, there exists another where it came up tails. A world where Hitler won the second world war, a world where an Indian Columbus discovered Europe in three tiny sailing ships, a world where John Kennedy assassinated president Lee Harvey oswald, a world where Elvis is still singing and Marilyn lived on to win a dozen oscars, a world where the dinosaurs still rule the earth, a world where magic works and physics won't, a world where the Dodgers never left Brooklyn. Worlds upon worlds, universe upon universe, lying as near to each other as pages in a book, yet each different, each telling its own story. An infinite number of worlds, all dimly dreaming of one another. And between them, perhaps there are... [Echoing] Doorways. [Horns honking] Watch it! Crazy! [Tires screeching] [Siren wailing] You have to keep your hand steady. This is a delicate operation. Mistakes can be fatal. Oh! What's that? Bingo. All you need is practice and your own dollar. For my next trick, I make you disappear. He's gonna be fine. Paging Dr. Bin. Paging Dr... I didn't know you could do magic. -Ah, my father was a magician. -Really? His best trick was making money disappear. When I misbehaved, he threatened to turn me into a frog, so I learned magic in self-defense in case I had to change myself back. -Ta-da! -All right! E.m.t.! Oh. What have you got? Head injury, facial laceration, maybe some internal. Her vitals are real strong, but she's nonresponsive. Madge, notify X-ray we're sending someone. We'll need a full set of cranials and an mri. Ambulance technician: Easy, now, easy. Thomas: All right, let's see what this is. What's this? Oh, let's get this off of her. -Oh! -Grab her! You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. If you... [Groaning] My nose! -Freeze! -[Gun cocks] Put that away! She's psycho. She's scared. My nose! It's around here someplace. We can fix it. Madge, f... find the officer's nose. Don't be afraid. No one will hurt you. I promise. I wouldn't get any closer if I was you. Uh, you're bleeding. Let... let me help you. Okay. P-Put that down, all right? Put... -Joe, call security. -I got it. I-i-I'm gonna just... [Water running] Sponge. Nose! All right, see? Careful. All right? Hey. It's all right. Just gonna do this. There we go. Okay, that's not too bad, but we're gonna need an X-ray. Will you come with me? We'll take her from here. I'm admitting the patient overnight for observation. We'll observe her down in lockup. Do you want the responsibility of removing her against medical advice? I told you to put that damn thing away. All right. I found it. Thomas: Could you let me in, please? I got orders. No one sees the prisoner. Oh. Around here we call them patients. I'd like to see her stitches. Five minutes. Watch your nose. Uh, the police don't want you going anywhere right now. I see you're not happy about that. I'm Dr. Mason. Thomas. Uh, the office wants to know if you have any medical insurance. Uh, a name... a name would be good. Look... I know you're in trouble. They told me all about this freeway thing. Maybe I can help you. Is there someone I can call for you. A friend? A lawyer? [Banging] Look, that's not gonna work. This is a modern hospital. The windows don't open. No. Stop it. Stop it! Stop it! You're gonna hurt yourself. What are you so afraid of? [Sighs] Look, this would be a lot easier if you'd just talk to me. All right. Play it your way. Maybe you'll have a better time talking to the police. Cat. Bingo. Not bingo. Cat name. Thomas. Right, Thomas. Thomas Mason. Where are you from, cat? Where do you live? Earth. That clarifies things. Not here. There. Door. [Door handle rattles] Leaving now, Thomas. Getting out. Cat, I'm sorry. This door only opens for me right now. [Knock on door] Oh, god, it's so early! Go away. Leave me alone. [Soft-rock music plays] Wake up. Jump in the shower. Put on your shyster hat. I need help. [Sighs] Did she really bite his nose off? Just the, uh, end bit. That's something. If you bite off the whole nose, they really throw the book at you. Do you think you could look into it for me? Yeah, I'll see what I can do. It sounds like a psychiatric evaluation would help. I'll owe you one. Thank you. So, why all the concern? How cute is she? Kinda cute, very cute, obscenely cute? [Clears throat] She's fat, homely, and has a lot of hair in her ears. May I remind you the penalty for perjury? And what is that? Mmm... ahhh! -Mmm. -[Laughs] [Elevator dings] Woman: They took her. They woke me up, them men in suits. The way that girl was kicking and screaming, how were we supposed to sleep? I told the night nurse I needed my pill regular, you know, for the pain. They don't listen. I'll bet you're selling my pills on the side. You don't fool me. Them doctors don't fool me neither. Somebody removed her. She didn't just get up and walk out of here. -I'm telling you, there's no paper on her. -That's crazy. Well, as far as the police are concerned, nothing happened on the freeway last night. Yeah, well, 100 people must have seen that truck blow up. Sweetheart, listen to me. A cover-up on this scale, we're talking very serious people. Do you really think this is something you should get involved with? Laura, nobody waltzes into my hospital and removes one of my patients. I don't care how serious they are. [Dial tone] Special agent Trager, federal intelligence unit. Would you come with me, Dr. Mason? Okay, what have you done with cat? Cat? So that's her name. Yeah. I'd like to see her right now. We'll take you to her. I can brief you on the way. Wait, wait, wait. On the way? What do you mean? Where? Can't tell you that. We would like you to talk to her, though. Fine. Bring her here, we'll chat all night. I'm afraid that's not possible. Look, I'm on duty. I can't just leave, okay? I'd have to have somebody come in and fill in for me. It's already been arranged. This is agent Cameron. I see you've met cat. Back to the station. Hop in, doctor. [Coughing] -Whoa! -Our shooting range. One of our bright boys decided to test-fire your girlfriend's weapon. She's not my girlfriend. How many were killed? Only the air conditioning. Let's go. Looks like a water pistol. Not water... air. It's quite sophisticated. Uses a high-velocity jet of pressurized air. Spits out these. Notice the awkward grip. The girl must have used both hands in order to fire. We believe the weapon was engineered for someone with... Different hands. You'd need fingers like a squid. Here. The police found three of these magazines in her pockets. Each one holds 144 needles. -And take a look at this. -[Computer keys clacking] Wow! I've never seen anything like that. It's, uh... -It almost seems, uh... -Organic? We thought so, too. Show him the bracelet. Here. The shell is more like horn than metal, yet it has a tensile strength greater than steel. And inside, well, you could call it microcircuitry, but, once again, it has certain organic characteristics. At 5:13 this morning, these insets emitted an intense yellow light for about nine seconds, and we don't know why. [Exhales deeply] Uh, look, you know, this show and tell has been fascinating, but I still don't know what you want from me. I'll make it real simple. We didn't make these. We want to know who did. [Approaching footsteps] Man: So many men, Diana. Their lights go on forever. Diana: This is such a strange place. So many creatures, like our own... Like our own world before the cleansing. The masters say ours is the only true world, thane. This is but a shadow. Perhaps the masters of this world say the same thing of our own. Or perhaps there are worlds without masters. You spend too much time with your old books, thane. A very dangerous pastime... Like your little female. What will you do with her once you find her? What I must. Agent: No, I'm telling you, she actually bit it off. No, i'm...[Clears throat] Place this in your ear. [Buttons beeping] [Buzzer sounds] Do that at your own risk, doctor. Mine. We get that on tape? What is that thing? G.o. Somebody get roth down here now. G.o. Sin grow later. My little female calls to me. She is scanning, my lord. South, southwest, 64 hexes, in the city of men. Dark lord: The female was your pet, thane. You shall bring her back alive. All she has and all she is belongs to me. I will write a symphony with her pain. To hear is to obey. Cat, what are you doing? That way. Blue... it's blue. You said we got a yellow light. Yellow. Yes, definitely. It's fascinating. Mason, find out what she's doing? Um... Cat, what are you pointing at? Door. No. Door, Thomas. Door. Where'd she get the bracelet? Where did you get this? A-A-And the weapon, the air gun. You know, boom! [Laughs] Boom? Hand Cannon. Not for men. Needing it, taking it, stealing it. Good for killing. [Clears throat] You didn't really kill anybody, did you, cat? Dark lord. Going out, Thomas. Ask her the significance of the chromatic change in the bracelet display. Get back to the bracelet. Find out what the colors mean. About the bracelet... The blue light points to the door, right? What about the yellow light? Yellow? When yellow? Uh... Last night. I don't know. Last night, I think. Too soon. Coming here now. Dark lord's man hound. Thane. -[Gasps] -Relax. She can't break through that. -You're safe here. -Not safe! Not safe! Woman: The glass! Cat, don't! What's wrong? Are you okay? Stop! Ohhh! -[Alarm buzzing] -[Bell ringing] Cat! Cat! -Cat! -Thomas, here! Agent 1: I can't believe she did that! Agent 2: The glass was supposed to be unbreakable! Beats me! [Indistinct talking] [Horn honking] Go, go, go! Help me, Thomas. Going fast. Cat, these guys have guns. Little guns. Come now. -[Door closes] -Hold it! Now, Thomas, now! -Get out of the car! -I can't do this. Why don't you move over? [Engine turns over] [Tires screeching] Thomas: We're out. We're out. We're really out. Where are we going? My father would have loved you. You know more tricks than he ever did. Better ones, anyway. 1,100 hexes, Thomas. Fast! Much fast! All right. Uh, what's a hex? Damn! No spare. I'm gonna tell the government. Fixing it. I can't fix it. We need a new tire. Getting new tire. There are no tires except the ones we came here on. [Sighs] Maybe we ought to think about what we're doing here anyway. Running. Getting away. Right. I know. Thane is coming. You told me. So, what is a thane? Man hound. Thane saying, "let her live. "Gift to me. "Served you well." Saying, "little animal, "wanting her." Dark lord giving me to him. Wait a second. So, you're thane's... Not his. Never. Going now. Door opening soon. Be there sooner. Before new light. W-W-Wait. So we have to reach this door before tomorrow at dawn. Is that what you're saying? What happens if you don't make it? Door closing. Thane catching. Then dying, Thomas. Thank you. Hey. Thanks. This is going well. Why don't you try it? Come on. Damsel in distress. Show 'em a little leg, you know? "It happened one night"? Happening one night? Never mind. Um, you just stand there a-and look, um... Look like you look. [Vehicle approaching] [Tires screeching] Not needing leg. Closer now. Cat, this door. Where's it gonna take you? Earths. Earths? More than one earth? Other earths. Same... different. Different? Past, present, what? Always being now, Thomas. Now, I... Look, I really do want to believe you here, I just... What are you looking for? Free place. Safe place. Thomas, hearing stories... Long time back. Little then. Doors going to better place. Doors going to happy place. Yeah. Those are the hardest kinds of doors to find, cat. Thomas: Um, where are we? What town is this? Driver: T. Or c. -Excuse me? -Truth or consequences, new Mexico. Oh, perfect. Well, thanks for the lift. -Going now? -Uh, yeah, yeah. Just a minute. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there. [Pay-phone buttons clacking] [Telephone rings] Hello? Hi, it's me. Thank god. That brief was supposed to be filed yesterday. Would you care to explain what happened? -The police are there, aren't they? -Yeah. Oh, Laura, I never meant for you to get dragged into this. It's not your fault. Is your client in trouble? A little. Maybe a lot. Oh, I'm in way over my head on this one. Going now, Thomas! Okay, take it easy. I'll be there in a minute. Listen, tell them to give me another 12 hours. I'll turn myself in as soon as I can get cat to... To wherever the hell she's going. Are you sure you're all right? It won't be so bad. I know a real good lawyer. Look, I should go. I just wanted to hear your voice. Are you okay? I will be once you're home. I love you, Tom. [Receiver clicks] Cat! Wait! We must be close. There. Bingo. Thomas! Here. Of course. What else? I hate to tell you this, but it's a men's room. Too soon. Waiting now. Thomas? Coming? I wish I could. When I was little, I used to think my father was Merlin. Then one day, I found out it was all just tricks. Maybe the real magic is right through that door. I-I-It's too late for me, cat. I've got a life and a career, girlfriend, student loans to repay. This is as far as I go. [Car doors close] You're under arrest. Cat, no! -How did you find US? -Doctor, please. We never lost you. We wanted to find out where she would go. I've got to admit I didn't expect this. Put her in the car. -Trager, give her a chance. -Oh, I don't think we need cops on the dock. Just a couple more minutes. The door's... The door leads to a John. Now, we've wasted enough time on this. Trager... Who the hell are you? Thane. Give me the female, and I will not harm you. The girl's a federal prisoner. Griggs, mondragon, arrest this man. -You're under arrest. -[Groaning] -Let go! -Cameron, stop it. Shoot it! [Electricity crackles] -Go on, now. Get her out of here. -Damn it, fall down! [Groaning] [Groaning] You should have given her to me. -[Flesh crackling] -[Flesh ripping] Do you remember me, little animal? The one who gave you mercy? You repay it in shame. Let her go, you son of a bitch! Is this your new mate, little animal? This shadow of a man? He's even less a warrior than the others. Look at him. [Groans] Cat, go! Cat. Yes, I gave her that name, shadow man. Did she tell you that? I taught her to read, to speak. I fed her, clothed her. I gave her life and honor. I took her as my mate. What kind of a man are you? Not a man. A man hound. [Electricity crackles] Cat... Whoa! Oh! [Coughing] Thomas? Laura... Cat. Cat... Cat. Where's thane? Where's the gas station? It's all gone. Behind. Safe now. Oh, god. I pulled you through the... Through the door. Oh, my head. -Hurt? -Yeah. Same like cat? Mine. The door. Where's the door? No door. What do you mean, there's no door? Of course there's a door. We came through it. It's right here. It was right up here... Someplace. It's, uh... I don't know. It all looks the same. Okay, how soon before this door opens again? No door this side, Thomas. There, here. Not here, there. One way? Cat... How do I get home again? Cat: Thomas! Thomas! Thomas: Denver. Bingo. Denver good place? It's a wonderful place. It's not oz, not the twilight zone. The door just brought US to Denver. We're still on earth. Telling you before... Always on earths. There's got to be some traffic around here some place. Maybe we can hitch a ride. -What is it? -Traffic, Thomas. [Hoofbeats] No, no, no, no, no! Big dogs. Not dogs. No, no, no. Stay here. Hey there! Freeze, or next time I won't miss! Don't shoot! [Gunfire] Cissy: I said stay where you are! Damn it, cissy, cut that out! You're scaring the horses. What can we do for you? Uh, w-we need a ride. We ran out of gas. [Laughs] Yeah, about 15 years ago, I'd say. Why's your girlfriend hiding behind that rock? That's not my girlfriend. This is cat. Cat, stand up... slowly. Shooting now, Thomas. Don't shoot! Don't! There's... take it easy. We need a ride to Denver, if that's possible. If you're going that way, it would be nice. Or any way would be okay with US. You know, it must be 10 or 12 years since the last time I picked up a hitchhiker. Right. Uh... what year is it anyway? Well, it was 1993 when I left California. That's great. Oh, that's excellent. Great year, 1993. Well, are you going or not? Come on. Grandfather, we can't. Jake: They're all right, cissy. I'm never wrong about people. Big not dogs. Horses, cat. They're called horses. She's different. So, how long till we get to the main road? This is the main road. Ah. So, where you headed, Jake? Denver, but we'll be spending the night at the truck stop on the way. You and your girlfriend are welcome to sleep in the rig. Not my girlfriend. Uh, she's not good with pronouns. If it's all the same to you, we'll catch another ride, maybe something a little faster. Leave the gun alone. Well, when I was your age, I was the same way. Live for speed. All I needed was my rig, my radar detector, my tape deck, and the open road. Oh, a man could fly in the old days. Why are you looking at me that way? You're weird. What do you want from US? Ride. Denver. Wonderful place. Hey. Give me that. That's peanut oil. Do you have any idea how much this stuff is worth? What the hell's going on back there? She spilled the oil. So what? It's not like we don't got another 4,000 cans just like it down below. Grandfather, you gonna tell them where the guns are hidden, too? What's wrong with you? Sorry about that. She gets a little irritable sometimes. Hyah! So, uh... what's all the fuss about peanut oil? Can you think of a better lubricant? Well, maybe petroleum. [Laughs] You're a funny guy, Tom. [Indistinct conversations] Man: Hey, Bobby, what do you say? Wake up. Wait up there. [Indistinct talking] Jake: Hello, Joe. Can you get me a beer while you're at it? Ah, this place brings back a lot of memories. Used to be a jukebox right over there. You're not gonna start talking about airplanes again, are you? And how you'd drive to the other end of town to get a pizza and not think a thing of it? What can I get you folks? Trager? What, do you two know each other? -No. -Yes. I don't know no Trager. You got me confused with someone else. Well, whoever you are, think we can get a pitcher of beer and some milk for my granddaughter? -Sure thing. -All right. Uh, cat, you wanted me to show you where the restrooms were. Not needing rest. Yes, you do. Come on. We'll be right back. That was Trager. I don't care what he says. Cat, I saw him die. It's the same man. The same? Different. No words for saying, Thomas. Here. Look, the same... Different. The same... Different. Dark lords saying all the worlds like different mirrors. [Sighs] Understanding now? Mirror images... Oh... my god. We're in a parallel world. Telling you. My late husband always used to say that the beer tastes better in the old days. Everything was better in the old days. Grandpa. My boys are the same way. Yeah, these kids today just don't seem to understand. Tom, how old were you when it happened? When, uh, what happened? [Laughs] [Laughs] Pretend I've been trapped in a cave for 20 years on another planet with amnesia. Jake: Okay, I'll play. We're talking about the bug, the one they came up with to deal with that big oil spill off of Australia, remember? Australia, right? They... made the insect? No, not a "bug" bug. It was more of a microgene-type thing. Ate oil. Right. So it ate the oil spill. Well, for appetizers. That just seemed to make it hungrier. It ate all the oil in the world. And all the plastics and all the gas and all the resins. Cleaned the plate. Right. Right, right. That's... must have been pretty, um... Damned inconvenient. You can say that again. [Bluesy piano music plays] [Glass shatters] [Music stops] I'll, uh, I'll be right back. Cat, what is wrong? -[Horse snorts] -What are you doing? Getting loose not dogs. Getting loose horses. Going now. Thane coming. Dark lords coming. Wait a minute. These aren't our horses. Needing them. Wait, you don't understand. These horses don't belong to US. They belong to Jake and cissy. Leaving now! Going fast. You can't even ride. Of all the emergency rooms in all the hospitals in all the cities in all the world, you had to roll into mine. [Horse neighs] Why do I even try? Cat, there are places where they kill you for stealing horses! -Killing them first. -No! Enough of this crap, okay? I'm already a fugitive in one world. I'm not gonna try for two. No! Not touching, not shaking. Going out, Thomas. Door. Door out? Cat, is this a door home? Where? How far away? [Gun cocks] What are you two doing here? These your horses? Didn't think so. Get away from the animals. -Look, all we wanted... -I know what you wanted. Colorado highway patrol, undercover. You're under arrest. Now, get away from the horses. Don't make any sudden moves. Now! What's going on here? What are you doing to those two kids? Caught them trying to steal your horses. I knew they were no good. Woman: Shame on you people. -Jake, let me... -[Groans] I don't want to hear nothing you got to say. You go sit down, mister. Right through those doors. Come on. Back to your beers. It's just like I told you. You hear all these frightening stories about trouble on the roads these days, and then look what happens to these nice people. Mom, it's not that bad. We'll be all right. It just scares me to death. Well, maybe you should travel with US... You know, a caravan. Grandpa! Could we? I mean, d-do you think? I think so. Wait'll you see cissy on her sewing machine. Thank you. [Crickets chirping] [Scoffs] Don't leave home without them. Thomas? All right? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. I guess I'm a little too tired to sleep. Laura. Her name is Laura. Wanting her now? I miss her, yeah. Loving her? That too. Lights out. Well, at least the stars are still the same. I used to know a man back... Back home... who used to sit and count them. God, he'd have his work cut out for him here. Look at them all. Know counting. One... Two... Three... Five... Six. Four. You forgot four. Four... Six... 12...20. No. Okay, you're as bad at math as I am. Let's try this again. -One. -One. -Two. -Two. -Three. -Three. -Four. -Four. -Five. -Five. -Six. -Six. -Seven. -Seven. [Hoofbeats] Do you mind telling US where we're going? -You'll be tried in Denver. -Denver? What about horses? How are we gonna... Feet, Thomas. You know, the one thing I can't figure out is where you knew me from. Well, let's just say I confused you with your brother. I don't have a brother. Uh, your mirror image, your shadow, your doppelganger. We're not from your world, Trager. Leaving soon. Thane coming. Who's thane? The guy who killed you. [Laughs] And you expect me to believe all this crap, right? No. You didn't believe it last time either. [Hoofbeats] Thanks for coming with US. It's my pleasure, Jake. I feel safer being with you. You know, I guess we got off lucky last night. I still can't believe those two kids. It's a sad world when you just can't trust nobody. Wasn't like that in the old days. It used to be, I'd never have to think twice about picking up a hitchhiker. You met all kinds of people on the road back then. Servicemen, college kids, hippie girls. [Buzzing] What's that noise? Bees? Like hell. That's bikers! Here they come! Wait till they're in range, cissy. You better get inside where it's safe. I'll stay right here, Jake. Please tell Cecilia to back away from the sewing machine. [Gunshots] -[Gunshots] -What the... [Gun cocks] Go ahead. Get it over with. Killing him now? He's not the enemy, cat. Look at this stuff! There must be 1,000 cans! -Liquid gold. -Yeah, and it's sweet, ah! You idiot! That stuff is worth more than you are. When's the last time you took a bath? Well, I'll take one right now, mom. You wanna scrub my back? Huh? Leave her alone. You got what you want. Let US go. Hey, load up as much as you can there in the camper. We don't want to get caught with that wagon over there, okay? -Hurry it up! -Can't we have some fun first, mom? Yeah, can we, ma? Please? Take your hands off of her! [Cissy screams] Just make it quick. There's work to do. Come on! [Cheering and yelling] -Woo hoo hoo! -Help! [Screaming and growling] Ah! [Gasping] Another one. Even better, guys. No waiting. [Laughter] Oh, she's got a toy gun. Ooh. Bang bang. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Boom. Let's get the hell out of here now! Where you going? You gotta come back here! [Indistinct yelling] Hey, where you going? Hey, hey! What the... You lousy brats! Cowards! [Gunfire] Drop the gun. You're under arrest. Cissy. [Sobbing] Where's the nearest hospital? Denver... Other side of those mountains. Well, he's gonna die if we don't get him to that hospital. I'm based out of an old ranger station near here. If we can get him there, I can radio down the afternoon flight. Afternoon flight? Get these mailbags out of here. That's the United States mail. Well, dump the United States mail in the grass. We need more room. That's a federal offense. Look, elmo, I'll get the mail to Denver personally. -Can cat come with US? -We'll never clear the mountain. If it gets in the way, she'll blow it up. Not going away. Not leaving Thomas. Cissy needs you, okay? Go with her. Door opening... Denver next dark. I will be there. Don't worry. Promising? Promising. Cast off. She moves east... In the wind. She will be at the door before the dawning. She may not go to the door, thane. She may hide instead. Dark lord: Thane... Disgraced, twice-failed. I will give you one last chance to regain your honor. I live to serve. Find her, but do not harm her. Her crime has been great. Her anguish must be greater. She will serve my pleasure, not your empty pride. [Engine whirring] Man: Come on, get up. Get out of the way! Did you hear anything? [Voice breaking] I'm scared. And if he dies... He was trying to save me. [Sobbing] Did you ever get scared? No time scared. Running... Fighting... Hiding. [Approaching footsteps] -Cecilia Mitchell? -Yes. -Is... -He's going to make it. Can I see him? He's in the I.C.U. Right now, sleeping. He won't even know you're there. Please, I... I wanna see him. Not scared now? Not scared now. Not scared now. Not scared now. Not scared now. [Sighs] Sure is beautiful in your world. There you go again. My world. Last time I saw Denver, it was brown with pollution. Well, clean air's one of the fringe benefits of the bug. Tom, where you from, really? -I told you. -Ah, yeah, right... Alternate world. See that tree? You see how it branches out? How the trunk divides into two... Into four limbs... And the limbs go to the bigger branches, the big branches to the little branches. Big branches and little branches... -What is this, a botany lesson? -No, no, no. We think of history as a straight line... Past leads to present. But what if it were more like a tree? Each branch is another world, another earth. But each branch is different. Say your branch gets the bug, and on mine it never happens. But there are other branches, other worlds. Um, say a world where you marry your high-school sweetheart, and I pitch for the twins, right? A world where we're never even born. A world where Hitler was assassinated and jfk wasn't. Uh... where dinosaurs exist, where life never evolved at all. You see, as many worlds as there are stars in the sky. Okay... Say I buy it. Come on! Question is, how do you get from one branch to another? Come on! No, no, the question is, how do you get back? Jake: Mmm. My treasure? [Sighing] Oh. The oil... The drums were hit. It spilled everywhere. I'm sorry. Oh, that... Peanuts. You're my treasure. Thank you. I heard your boyfriend patched me up. Where is he? Not his boyfriend. Not here. Too slow. Dark soon. Door soon. He'll be here. He's the kind who keeps his promises. [Indistinct talking] Hi. Hey. There's never any parking at the post office. They took him to the hospital. Come on! [Whistles] Rocky mountain general, fast! Okay. They say how he was doing? No, but he must still be alive. [Horn honks] Can't you pedal this thing any faster? Depends on the tip. Okay. Man: Live and direct from Kansas City, the eighth episode of "the wench." See Samantha Stephens like you've never seen her before. Karen will be there, morrie... Oh, cissy, how's Jake? -Is he gonna be okay? -He'll be fine. No time. Going now! No, thane is here. We just saw him. Don't worry about him. I'll give you a police escort. This guy already killed you once. No time. Going now. No, no! No, no. Now. All right, you go in front of the theater. I'll double around back and meet you. -Where is she? -Gone. -She said... -I would not harm you. [Air hisses] She knows me too well. Count yourself lucky, child. You are not fit prey for a hunter. That way. Down here! Wait a minute, Denver doesn't have a subway. Not finished yet. Been building it for three years. No talking. Help me. Cat? Cat! Careful where you wave that thing. They're still blasting down here. Cat! Bingo! Not bingo, Thomas. Dark lord: Did you think I had forgotten you, little animal? Diana, leave off. She's mine, this one. [Electricity crackles] [Gun cocks] [Electricity crackles, gun cocks] -[Crackling continues] -Ooh! [Bones crunch] Mine, I said, man hound. Ah! Go on! Go on, get her out of here! [Laser fires] [Electricity crackles] Go now, Thomas. We'll never make that door. Die trying, then. [Gun cocks] [Laser fires repeatedly] Nobody kills me twice. Oh! Ah! [Both grunting] Come on. Ah! We made it. Are you all right? All right. Good. Okay, where are we now? Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Here we go again.
