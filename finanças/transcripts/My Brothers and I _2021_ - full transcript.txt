Tomorrow summer vacation begins. It's going to be very hot. No walking barefoot. Unless it's on the sand, with wet feet. Yeah, go! Come on, guys. Tomorrow the sun will pound on the beach. Like every year, paint will chip off the neighbor's window. Tomorrow, I'll ask them if I can quit school. Like my brother, Hédi, 3 years ago. And my other brother, Mo, who now works his abs all day at the International Hotel pool. Here, it's like school is good for nothing. So, tomorrow, I'll look for work like them. If I can't find any, I'll try soccer. Or else I'll leave. I'll do what it takes for things to change. Come on, guys! You're not from here. Those are my brothers, shirtless. See the little one, Abel? Well, I mean the short one. He's the biggest. He almost went pro. Cool. Yeah, but he broke some knee ligaments... My folks had no money for rehab. That's what he says. The others don't buy it. Actually, I'll be honest. I like gentler sports. Well, I think I don't like sports. You like soccer? Yeah. Yeah? You know, sometimes I like it. When you think of it, soccer's like dancing. Quit acting Italian, Hédi! There's no penalty, stop. No penalty! Shut the fuck up! Penalty! Get up, no penalty. He touched the ball. No one's playing! Let go! Penalty? You serious, dude? -What is this? -A penalty. -What penalty? It was momentum! -No penalty! No penalty, huh? You're a ball-buster! Take the ball. Your mother! Nour! Go get the ball, please! Go on! Anyway, I'm usually here when my brothers play soccer. Bye. Hey, give me that. LA TRAVIATA, MY BROTHERS AND I Little Nour! How you doing, my dude? -Going home? -Yeah. -Hey, Pierre. -Hey. -You good? -Yeah, you? Aight. Aren't you sick of this? The same music! Sick to death of it. -Seriously. -It's night time. What do you know? Don't you worry about me. Bae-ito! Washboard abs! -Where you going? -The hotel, season opener. -Lower it. -I just turned it off. It was loud. Enough Pavarotti! -It wasn't Pavarotti. -Where are the jerseys? -There. -That's all? He said it's all in there. -What now, fuck! -Watch it. -What? -What's your summer plan? -Watching videos? -It's for Mom. She doesn't give a shit. Turn it off. -And work with Pietro started. -Good. But find a real job. Hustle your ass. -Don't hang with Hédi. -He forces me. Then come see me, that's all. I'll call Karim Pizza, maybe he's hiring. Let's go, guys. Come on! Mess with me, you get two more months. -I warn you. -Two months? Two months! Got it? Romain, the low wall with the tags. Repaint it, please. Romain, I'm not done. Ymran, don't laugh. You sweep the yard. -No! -Oh yes. With a nice broom. Not like last time. I catch you smoking, you pay! -Nour, know the 2nd floor? -Yeah, it's my school. -What? -It's my school! There! Volume up. Repaint the 2nd floor of your school. Remaining two, gardening with me! -I don't have a green thumb. -Want a red face?! Come on, grab those rakes. In three hours I'm coming to check your progress. No noise! There are summer activities on every floor. I'm gonna be first! Ymran! Stop laughing! Work that broom! Let's go! Leave it, Martine. We'll take over. Can we pay you next week? -Sure. -Last time, I promise. Don't worry. Really, pay me when you can. Thank you, Martine. -I spoke to your uncle. -No. Stop right there. We want her home with us. He's got a point. What does he know? He doesn't live here. Hospice care can be pretty trying for loved ones... Martine, really, it's all right. It doesn't bother us. Well, if there's any problem you can count on me. Right? See you soon. -See you. -Goodbye, guys. Goodbye. Damn... God damn! Are you taking the piss?! Where the hell do you think you are? Hello, ma'am. Please excuse us, he fell. From where? He was peeking in the window... And he'll mind his business now. -Apologize! -Sorry. It's community service. You might see them. Now and then. They have lots to do. -Is there a girl you know? -No, I heard the TV. What did you hear? That's enough, sorry! -Answer the question. -Pavarotti. If he bothers you, come see me. No problem. No worries, thanks. -What's your name? -Nour. You know Pavarotti? -Yeah. -You like him? I don't know. You like to sing? I don't know. So you're a painter? I'm nothing! Is this an interrogation? Want to come sing with us? Making fun of me? -Do I seem like it? -Never mind. Listen, if you want to, you're welcome. Girls, on your feet. Time to wake up. Damn. No. We're way off key now. Nice little motor. Go. Loretta, look at your posture! Like a fish! Stand up straight. Be proud! Girls, this is Nour. We know him. He's in our school. He's going to sing for us. -That's cold. -Come on, Nour. This is some serious hazing. No, I never sing. What's this? You want us to beg? Sit down. We're listening. Stand there. I only know one thing by Pavarotti. -I'll do it from here. -No, come in. -Come in! -No way. I'll do it here. It's embarrassing! -What's the melody you know? -The song? Yeah. Una Furtiva Lagrima. Hang on. -More or less. -You know it? Yeah. Here's your first note. It's an F, ok? What's a F? I don't know notes. Just count to six twice and go. -It'll happen naturally. -Wait. -Ready? -All right. Again. But this time stretch your back. -Stand up straight. -You know I'm not? Again. Here you go. Good. Hang on. Now you lost the key. Hear that? That's enough, bye. See you later, Nour. Listen to this, ma'am? Julia was warming up. But now we took a break. -No! -Goddamn it! You've been fucking off! You're busting my chops today, all of you! Nour! Damn, we're not on vacation! What's that? La Traviata. Sorry. Must be a neurological problem. -But he'll stop. -No problem. -Come on, you! -Hey, take it easy. Nour! Wait, Nour. Here. You can look at this. Give it back later. We're here Mondays and Thursdays. -My name is Sarah! -And mine is Pietro! -Come when you want. -I'm writing you up! Ten of them. Nour. Nour, get up. Go to Billy's, get the water. Mo! I'm leaving the envelope for Mom. -Kick some money in. -Yeah. Don't forget. Close the door! I got in late last night. What are you doing? The door! Broke down again? It broke again! -Hey, kid. -What now? Come here. I'm talking to you. -Doing good? -Yeah. -Where's your big brother? -Which one? I got 3. What am I, stupid? -Fuck! -You're working for him. I don't work, I'm in school! It's vacation. Tell him to call me. Take this. That's my number. Nour, turn it down! No. Tell him twelve Brazil jerseys. Twelve. Thirty euros each. Thirty. Thirty euros each, yeah! Here. I saw your girlfriend. What girlfriend? Get over here! Drop the watermelon. -Let me go! -What did he say? What did you say!? Give me a break. -Downstairs? -No! -I ain't playing! -He said call him back! Get away! Stop going ballistic. What do you want? Yeah, so? -In 2 months, I'm gone! -Wake up, dude! I'm never waking up! Move. Keep Nour out of your crap, or else! He hurt me. I got work today. On your way home. Every morning... Hey, the watermelon! Let's go, guys. Grab the rakes, the shovel, and you two grab the brooms. Get the lead out. Finish sweeping the other side. Pietro, can I work? You? It's Thursday, grown-up day. I'll have less to do next time. We won't be here next time! Go home! Nour, where are you going? -Where? In the room. -But that's singing. -So? -You're in singing? Shut your face, ok? Piss off! Faster! Move it! Dumbass. Listen up. Shit! Callas is something else. Damn! I can't help it, drives me wild. -Thanks, Loretta. Good choice. -You're welcome. -Hello. -Be on time if you come. -I didn't know... -You do now. When she sings it's alive, it's always true. Come on, take a seat. Make room, girls. All right. Today... Let's really warm-up, to optimize our voices. Stand up. Energy on your feet. Take a deep breath, and let out an "S" for as long as possible. How about with the straws? -Sure! -No, not with straws. -I like straws. -No, I can't do it! It only happens to you, with that large mouth. She does have a large mouth. You actually shape them. All right, settle down. Who wants one? Maelys? Camille. -No one else? -No! Great singers can hold it 50 seconds. Let's see how you do. Go! You're stiff. It's not freediving, Nour. Don't block it up. Go. There. Out of breath already, Loretta? What? -I can't help it. -The ya-ya's! No, not the ya-ya's! Please! Why not? -Seriously, that sucks. -Is this a revolt? You'll see, it's so dumb. Julia, show us! If it's so dumb... Nour, watch Julia carefully. Perfect! That does sound dumb. Everybody. Again. Yeah, not bad. Well, hang on! We got a real choir singer! -You never learned? -No, I just do it. Never lose that! I don't get the notes. Even Pavarotti, on his scores, when the music went up he drew an arrow up, or down if it went down. He wasn't good at reading music. Forget that for now. You'll learn later. -I just imitate. -Yes. So did I. I started out imitating singers for laughs. Turns out, I found my voice. So let's keep on imitating. Warming up is part of that. A singer's instrument is his body. This helps increase your lung capacity, lengthen your breath. Got the envelope? -What? -Got it or not? -How'd you know I was here? -I know everything. Cough it up. What are you looking at? It's my money. You guys don't get it. It's for the medicine. -Where is it? -What is this? Don't move, it's me. -Your hand! -It's for medicine! What is this? You weren't even with Pietro! Fool! Don't come back here. I don't get it. How'd you lose the envelope? I'll call the pharmacy. It was closed. I went to the other one. It happens, though. -Yeah, it... -Shut your fucking face! 300 euros of meds! You don't pay it. You know what it means to us? You're going to work now, buddy. Vacation's over! -We get Medicare. -Stop it, Nour! It's not enough. You know it's complicated. Was it Hédi? What was? Hédi took the money. No. You sure? Yeah. That asshole. What's going on here? Where's the medicine money? What money? Don't play with me. All right, guys. Abel, what's the big deal? What is it, 300? I'll get it. Summer business is good. I'll hit that, and get cash. You're ok. Fuck! You crazy? -Where's that money? -Let him go! Enough! Enough! -Stop! -Come here. For 300 bills? That it? I'd rather use it for me, alive! 300 euros. -She's gonna die like Dad. -Shut up! -Shut up? -I'll kill you. Kill me! That'll be two dead! -Bastard! -Stop it, she can hear you. I want the 300 here tomorrow morning. And if not? -If not I'll cut you to pieces. -Abel, damn. Come here. Sit down. Shit, this is no good guys. Stay there. This is no good. Hang on, don't move. Don't move. I'll buy the meds, we'll say it's you, and that'll do it. Ok? All right? Do you hear me? Breathe. Stop crying, we're good. I'm going to hit it for you. I swear I didn't say anything. Don't lean your head forward. And relax here. I look stupid. Looking silly doesn't matter. Stand straight. Keep the ball here. That's good. That's it. Yeah. When you breathe in... Put the pipe down. Your favorite dish? Pasta and clams. Good. When you breathe, think about clams. Come on. Smell of clams. Wonderful. What delicious clams. Good. First verse is coming along. Not bad! You feel it? You hear the difference? I think so. Girls? You should learn something you don't know. In the book I gave you. The lyrics to Brindisi, fromLa Traviata . Learn that for next time? It's a little complex, but... it's fast so you'll sing with another energy. -All right? -All right. Fiona? Your turn. Now, let's move around to get into it. There. Feel your body. -Here. -Thanks. Did you know stuff when you started? No. I mean not opera. My brother plays guitar, that's all. Scooter! How did you become interested in choir singing? The neighborhood center offers the activity. We're here on vacation so my dad wanted me to, instead of... hanging around at home and all, and I was into it, too. -You want to be a singer? -No. -Too hard to be a singer. -Car! Car! It makes summer go faster. -You know she's like a star? -Yeah? I never saw her on TV. Me neither. -Watch that corner! -No one there! How did you know the melody you were singing? My father. He sang that to my mother, to hit on her. What? He's Italian. He's from Emilia-Romagna. What's Emilia-Romagna? Pavarotti's home. You think by singing you can get some? No way. I'm just trying to be like him. Anyway... I'd like to sing it for my mom. She'd like that. Your share. Thanks. -What's that orange sauce? -Algerian. Disgusting. Tony's is the best. It's homemade. Tony never washes his hands. He's a pig. Shut the hell up. Hey, isn't that... -The po-po! -Run! This way! Come on! In the bushes! Ow! It's scratching my ass! Shut up. -A branch is scratching my ass. -Shut up. It's over, there's no one there. Come on, let's go home. Shit! That thing is scratchy! Hey homies. What up? You all right? Time for you to eat. You're hungry. I can tell by how red you are. Go ahead, eat. What are you doing? What's he doing? Increasing my lung capacity. This dude is cracked. Smells like shit here. Close your nose and your mouth, and work! Come on. We're better off in jail than here. -Watch Nour bust it. -I prefer the school. You messed up there and this is not summer camp! And you work! I can see you. Pietro! Pietro, please! What? -I need to pee. -Having me on, Picasso? I'll bash your head in. You think this is your sister's house? What does this say? "C.S.W." Community Service Work! I thought we were in "Educational Projects"? You get to work! Plus I worked hard today. Go, hurry up. Little schmuck. Work! Come on, move it! The punk will flunk, and turn to junk Beauty and flash, put the rot in the trash! Feel your hands. It's 2:30, Nour. -I know, but... -We started 30 minutes ago. I told you. Either come on time or don't come at all. -I came as fast as I could. -Fine. Fine, but this is not a revolving door. All right? You stopped laughing. -I can't talk? -No, that's how it is. That's it. Singing is discipline, too. If you can't be disciplined, go home. -I make sacrifices to be here. -What? -Rich bitch sacrifices? -What? Know what I risk for your class? You don't know me, watch it. Fuck your class, all right? -Go home! -Yeah, go home. And your mom? How's it going? Is she better? She's not better, but we're hanging in. I'll pray for her. You pray? When I have to. Here. The warm-up suits, and the "Medium" jerseys. The rest tomorrow. Got any Brazil? -Is this Bangladesh? -Didn't see it. Give me a Brazil jersey, and jogging pants if you got them. Sixty euros, please. You know your brother's off the rails. What do you mean? He asked to go pee, then he never came back. What can I tell you? He's been inside already. Keep this up, he'll do real time. I try to talk sense into him. Nothing gets through. I'm talking about Nour. He went singing on me. With the summer school activities. I think there's a girl involved. Singing, like real singing? Yeah, like Mariah Carey. I'm telling you because I have to put him on report. Then he might get detention, or an extension. To be fair to the others, I have to. Just so you know. So you won't be shocked. -So you and me are straight. -Yeah. Anyway, thanks. Don't forget about the money. The money. -How much did we say? -Sixty. -Thanks. -Thank you. -You all right? -Think she'll take me back? Sure, just apologize. Ok... She's right there. Quit sulking, I don't like it. Sorry, I went ballistic. It just came out. Yeah, thanks. I could tell you didn't force it. Want me to drop you off? You live nearby? No, that's all right. I'll walk. Could I come back next time? You better come Thursday, or I'll come haul your ass in myself. Did you start learning the Brindisi lyrics? See you next week. Oh shit. Shit! They fucking stole my battery! I know a guy who sells them. I'm sure he's the one who stole it. I have a rehearsal in an hour. What do I do? I don't know. "Terminado"! -Bye! -Bye. Seriously, she's fine. Not totally smoking, but... You see her look in my mirror? Oh my God, she was so checking me out! I'm quitting school, Mo! You're not 16, you can't. How'd you do it? I got an apprenticeship. In appetizing and foods. I did all kinds of paté, dude. Pork, duck, mortadella. I'm quitting anyway. What will you do? Whatever I want to do. I'll split. You think it's easy to split? You leave the hood, but... the hood sticks to you. Did you tell Abel about this? He'll let you leave school, but not home as long as mom's here. -What's that? -La Traviata ! -Beautiful. -Yeah. Dad sang that stuff for Mom when they were young. Yeah, I know. Oh, fuck. Julia, that was great. Nour? Did you bring the book back? Yeah, but I lost the last act. I can't understand it. No matter. -We'll do the beginning. -Ok. Warmed up? I'm warm, yeah. Now... From when Alfredo starts the Brindisi. Straight? Hey, don't panic. It's just for fun. Let's see how it goes. It's not a contest. Get to the end, I'll join you. Start on the three. One, two, three... to you. Don't rush it. Don't close your eyes. Sing to someone. Sing to someone. Look at someone. Always sing for somebody. You can sing for anyone. You can't be afraid. All right? Come on. It's gorgeous. This melody is pure joy. You have to play with the joy. Get joy out of it. That's the best way to sing. Yeah! Great. Then comes the chorus. Everybody. -Then Violetta. -Do it! Yeah, go ahead! -You here? -Hurry, they took her. -I'm working. -You could knock. -Come on, move it. -Sorry. Hey! -I'm talking! -See you next week, ma'am. -You're sick. -Watch it. I'm working, damn! Tomorrow you deliver pizza. That's work! Pick it up! After summer I'll quit school. -This the time for your bullshit? -I want to leave. You're staying right here! Got it? And you go back to school. No choice! That's it. Want to get Child Services on us? Is that what you want? Is it? No. Listen up. Now we're bringing mom home. Then you see Karim, and start bringing money in. Pietro said you ditched work to go with your dancers. Forget all that. Yeah... Or I'll make you forget. -Got it? -Yeah. Let's do it. French? Italiano? I love Germany. Beautiful. -What? -That's great. Great... Are you here on vacation? -Three weeks. -Three? That's great. You have time to go on walks. See the city. Meet people. And you? How long? Oh, me? How long? Me. Three days. I was in London. I'm here to see some family. I study International Law. At Cambridge. Know it? You didn't tell me. What's your name? Great! Not very German. Funny. At the Int'l Alliance, I have a friend named Chantal. She's great. Pleasure, Chantal. -Crying? -No, it's the wind in my eyes. -Later. -Not coming? No. I might drown him! My name is Marco. Get out of here. Beat it, I'm on a gig. Mo! Damn! What? Mo! Get the fuck out of here! Damn! -Come here. -I'm going to fucking kill him! What do you want? What? Speak! Smile. Looking for your parents. What is it? Stop frowning. Smile! -Who's she? -A tourist. What's the matter? Did I say to come? You're whoring poolside again! Fuck! You come to bust my balls? They took Mom to the hospital. -Who? -Uncle Manu and the doctors. -They came to the house. -Yeah? They said they had to or she'd croak faster. Don't say "croak". -Same thing. -Not "croak". Die. -Same thing. -Say "die", all right? Shit. Hey Pierre. Hey, guys. -Hi, Pierre. -Hi, kid. She's at the end of the hall. Damn, Nour! Take it easy. Sorry, it was momentum. Go tell Pierre. Hédi, help me get her in the chair. Come on, hurry up. I can't touch Mom's legs. In her nightie. What are you stupid? It's a hospital gown. I can't... Impossible. It's out of respect. This is shady. You're just crazy. -Never seen anything like it. -I should've been lookout. Here, take this, wrap it around her legs. Manu sucks, so... -Shut up, we got no time. -Mom's fine here. Shut up or I'll deck you. Pierre says hurry! Ok. Hang on, guys. Hold her legs tight. Hédi, give us some help here! -That's good. -Nour, get a cushion for her head. You do it. Watch her head. Hold it up. Hédi, the bag. Ok. Do it, do it. -Gentlemen? -Wait. On three. One... two... three. -Excuse me! Hey! -Go! Stop! Stop them! Why doesn't this door work? Pierre! Where is she? Better than a protein drink! Sculpting those pecs! What are you playing at, guys? We're doing what Mom asked. Your mother asked nothing. She had no time to. Look, she's with her sons. That's all. That's her wish. The doctors said she's better off here. The doctors said that six months ago. There's no change. You want her to die faster? Watch your mouth! -Stop! -Show some respect! What about you? -I wiped your ass before you could talk! -Manu! You throw us dough twice a year, you say we want to kill Mom? You think your two-bit hustles can pay for everything here? What would you do without me? Explain it to me? Go ahead... I'm listening. Why not work with me Abel? And leave everybody here? I'm not going anywhere. How about the kid? A restaurant needs help. Mind your fucking business. Why did you come anyway? You come here moralizing, then go show off your fancy suit? That it? You know how we live here. -Quit it. -Why, you forgot? You forgot your sister. Us. You forgot us. Twenty years, giving us change like we're peasants. Like you're a prince tossing a coin to us wretches. Job done until next time. -Fuck that. -You'd starve without me. We don't need your money. Mom's going to die. And she's going to die here. Because that's what she wants. Wire the money. It's already on your ledger for this year. For the funeral. -Save the bills, for taxes. -I'm proud of who I am. I had the same shitty life as you. Except I had some desire. And if I "toss you a coin" it's for my sister. Desire for what? Money? What do you think? You need courage to get out of here. See another way. Alone, with nobody's help. Manu, let us eat. You sound like an Urban Development pol. You're off the rails. Off the rails. Let us be, or I'll whack you. We all say fuck you. Got it? -Stop talking shit. -You not hearing me? Stop it! Look at that! You idiot! Mom? Abel! What is it? Mo! Hurry! Come upstairs! Come on! Hurry it up! -What is it? -It's Mom! Hédi! -Go ahead. -Wait. The kid lost it. Next time I'll call the nuthouse. I swear it's true! Damn! -You don't believe me? -I don't know. She's tired, that's for sure. You gonna quit your bullshit now? -Want fries? -Aren't they cold? Like usual. See that couple there? The couple. -Yeah? -See the bag? You a man, or not? Yeah... Well, no, I don't know. You take this. Snatch the bag, meet you in back. No, I can't. See that? You're not a man. No big deal. Here. Give this to Tony. -Tony smokes? -His girl does. He spoils her. Gives her all kinds of gifts. Here. Really? You put it in my score. Put it away. -My score! -Put it away! All right, I put it away. Eat. No! Why are they there again? Stay here. -Where are you going? -Wait! Hédi! -Are you stupid or what? -Shut your face! What are you doing? Hédi, stop it! Please! This is bullshit. We'll get caught! -Are you stupid? -Asshole! Hédi! You're so stupid. Now we're screwed, because of you! -Move it! -What? Move, get away! I'm staying with you! -Get away! -Come on, run! Motherfuckers! Go fuck yourselves! What? What's the matter? Bastard! What are you doing? Motherfucker! Stay there. What's that? What are you doing? Let him go! -Get the fuck off me! -Watch it, wiseguy! Let me go! You're hurting me! You're crazy! I got nothing! Nothing at all! Go ahead, search! -Let me go. -Shut up. -Julia! -Yeah? -Got a second? -Yeah. -Why isn't Nour coming? -No idea. -Know where he lives? -Near me. -Could you take me? -I have to meet my brother, sorry. But he lives in C7, next to me, so if you want... Totally. That's great. -But I'm busy later. -No problem. I'll drive you. Walk under that archway, cross the parking lot, building in the back. Got it. Thanks, Loretta. You're welcome, ma'am. Jose! What's going on? Yeah? -Hi. -How are you? Fine. This is Nour's house, too? Yeah, but it's mainly my place. Did you get to that thing on time? -The scooter's nice, right? The wind... -Thanks. -Is Nour home? -Yeah, and so am I. I have a great voice. I'm a mezzo-piano. -Who is it? -Nour's singing teacher. Right, Mariah Carey. I knock before entering! I learned that very young. We got different rules. Not my fault. Should I leave you two alone? Nour's not here. Yes, he is. What do I do to see him? No idea. Look around, girl. Oh, so you're calling me "girl"? Fine. I'll just wait here, nice and easy. No problem. You can't stay there. -I don't mind. -You'll see my brother when I say so. Fuck your tap-dancing class. Enough. Go ahead, ma'am. I don't know what this is about. End of the hall, on the left. Make her some coffee, too! -There. -Thanks. Why are you here? Traded singing for boxing? -That was my uncle. -Your uncle? An accident. He wanted to hit my brother, and I got in the way. So if anyone's absent you show up at their door, without warning? Stop looking around. My underwear and everything... Your piano? My mother's. She plays? My eldest brother saw her play. -I want to give you this. -Want to meet her? Well, I don't know... Come on, she'll like it. Coming? Not much on conversation, but they say she senses things. Mom, this is the singing teacher. She came to yell at me because I stopped going. There. Hello, ma'am. Good evening. My name is Sarah, I'm... I'm a singer. I come here to sing with kids, who... Whoever wants to. I came to see your son because he stopped coming. I wondered why he couldn't. And because your son has... He has something. Maybe. Talent. No one knows where it will lead him, but... he's got it in him. He mustn't miss out on that, he's lucky. Now he has singing on his side. Once and for all. It could help him... to see everything differently. It could bring him some joy. And strength. I took it on myself to come here, to tell him that. And to tell you that. Police! Open up! He's not here. You can't come in. Hello, ma'am. Hédi's room? I don't know. That's the mom in there. Is Hédi here? No, he couldn't make it. Get down. Out. Get out. What are you looking for? Julien! Come here. You take that thing. Hey, watch it! -Hey! -They're kids! Move! Let's go! Be careful. Aren't you ashamed? The piano! Hey, easy! There's nothing in it! -That's his piano. -Easy! -Please stop. -Don't touch me. -What gives you the right?! -We're doing our job! -Cuff her. -That's your job?! -Yes! -Wait! Calm down! Calm down! You come here. You're breaking it! I'm asking you to stop. You stupid prick! -Barbarian! -Excuse me. Those are my studs. Get off me, you prick! Want us to arrest you too? For what? For laughing? You've been warned. -Don't mess the kid up. -Barbarian! I'm kidding. You forgot your keys. What about Nour? He's a minor. They can't keep him as long. So why are you here? I got a friend. He told me you were leaving. You'll get off, don't worry. I got "disorderly conduct" and "insulting an officer". Nothing will stick, ma'am. Suddenly we're polite? Want a lift? Come on. Mind if I drive? You had a look around? Not really. I'm sure you can show me the sights. That's the harbor there. My family arrived on a ship, right there. Now they all want to leave. See that low wall? My father built it. Up and down, all along the beach. Your dad was a mason? Yeah, he did everything. But mostly masonry. You're famous? -Want an autograph? -Just asking. Could you do me a favor? It's for Nour. Check it out. If you want, give it to him. Stubborn as a mule. I just hope it's a check. Hey, Nour! Toss me an extra cheese! Mom stopped breathing. Apparently, Mom smiled. And a tear ran down her left cheek. Abel told us. Mom is sleeping, and she can see us. I'm sure she can see us. She's looking at all four of us. It's reassuring to think she sees us. I wanted to sing but, I don't know, my voice hurt. How long can you stay out? Until tomorrow morning. Then straight back inside. You really suck so bad. Coordinate your feet. Can you coordinate your feet? Go ahead. You suck! You suck! Nine and a half pounds. No way! Pierre lent you his convertible? There you go. Nice shirt! Get in! -I don't know. -Get in. -Hurry up! -Feels weird inside. Know what that is? Butterflies! Here, look. Wearing glasses helps. Good-looking! Not coming? No, I got work now. Get going! Break a leg, guys! I'm going. See you later. -Yes? -I'm here to see Sarah. -Where's Sarah? -Sarah? On stage. It's starting. -Got your seat? -Yeah. You should've come in the front. I'll walk you, come on. Come on. Yeah, all good here. Audience enters in five minutes! Come on! Hurry up! -How are you? -Good. Did you like it? Yeah, it was nice. Really... Did you cry? -No. That's the A/C in my eyes. -Your son? Do we look alike? A little, yes. Something about you. -How are you? -You're so good. -Thanks for coming. -That duet... Tomorrow summer vacation is over. It won't be so hot out, and the tourists will all go home. Tomorrow I can't see us living here, all together, without Mom. Tomorrow, I wonder what it will be like. Tomorrow I have to tell Hédi that Mom loved him too. Tomorrow there will be less and less soccer. Tomorrow... I'm leaving.
