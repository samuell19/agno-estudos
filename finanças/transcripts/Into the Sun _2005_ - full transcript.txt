Commencing data uplink, establishing connection. Okay. Beam me to Burma, Scotty. Satellite online, sir. Snowman to Reindeer, pick a visual on the target. Roger, Snowman. Target picked. Roger that. We have video confirmation, and you're coming in 4 by 4. Locking complete. Reindeer, transpo is on. Look at all those poppies. Travis, I'm almost liking you now. Copy that. Stand by. Don't move. We got company. No, sir. Don't go. Don't go. Oh, shit! Snowman, this is Reindeer. Hot evac. Get out of here. Get them out of there. Gray smoke in sight, approaching extraction point. Go. Come on! Don't run! The package is in the box. Let's go. You'll be all right. We live right... and we die right. You're not dying, man. You'll be all right. - You're a lying motherfucker. - Come on, now. You're not dying, man. I gotta lie down, man. Shit! Gentlemen... Good afternoon. Well done. I want to toast you on a job well done. - Cheers to the Governor. - Cheers. He's in a better place now. Time to go. - Block. - Hi. John Davidson, FBI. Listen, I'm calling regarding the governor's assassination. - What about it? - Well, we need your help. Johnny, it's local. It's not my party. We're thinking it's a Yakuza hit... and we're hoping that you have someone that has some knowledge in that field. Yakuza? Yeah, I've got someone. You're gonna owe me big for this one. Hello. Travis? Guess who. Sir. Hello? Okay, baby, I need you and your team up on him the second he leaves here. All the usual assets? - Of course, baby, anything you need. - Good. I'll be in touch. And don't call me "baby." That would be meant for me. - You two know each other? - Yeah. For a long time. But I'm assigning you to him for right now. Just try to stay with him. And keep me posted. Didn't take you that long to get here. Yeah, I was in the area. In a nutshell, the Governor made a lot of enemies... when he stated his plan to begin the deportation of certain people. So why are we involved? The FBI feels sure it's terrorist related. That makes it a concern for the United States. We have Intel that the local Yakuza... have been farming themselves out for some reason. I've been in this game a long time. Doesn't make sense to me that the Yakuza would be involved in politics. Anything is possible. Yeah, I suppose so. That's why I brought you in, big papa. Nobody knows the bad guys like you do. But with homeland security, the FBI is on board. I'm aware. I'll gather some Intel, feed it back to you, and you can give it to them. You know, life is never that simple. This is Agent Mac. He's going to be working with you. - How do you do, Agent Mac? - I'm good, thank you. - And what do you do? - I'm an FBI field agent. So in the event that there really is terrorist involvement... why don't you have the FBI put together a special response team... and get this boy a gun. Always great seeing you, Travis. That went well. The shooter exited on a sport bike going east. FBI. It was quick. It was loud. It just came out of nowhere. Welcome to the crime scene. - Travis. - Hello, Inspector. I need copies of all the physical evidence here. Sure. Immediately, I want copies of all the surveillance tapes. - You hear? - Okay. So this is the security tape for the government's incident? Guy on the right. Little bit closer. See that gold emblem on his neck? See if you can come real close on that for me. - I wanna take a look at that. - Okay, I got you. - How about that? - Okay. Not only do these guys look Chinese, but that one's Quang Quang. These guys are Tongs. I've got somebody I've gotta go talk to. - Can you get me a copy of this? - Yeah, sure. Dai-Ryu, it's been a long time. Please sit down. What a surprise. You look younger and taller. And I see you're still reading the same old books. Just a simple man passing the time. Tell me, what brings you today? I've heard a rumor about an alliance between the Tongs and the Yakuza. I have a little problem with the Yakuza, but I don't want one with the Tongs. So I was wondering if you'd talk to them for me. Yakuza. I heard the rumors in the street. I'll help you. I'll talk with them and I'll make sure they leave the situation. Wait. Since you surprised me... I'm going to surprise you. Mei Ling. Look who has returned. Master. - Her skills have much improved. - She's gotten big. She's been my shield. Now she's yours. Okay. I'll see you soon. Chen and I have been in business for two years. He told me you have a sophisticated distribution network. Yes. With his pachinko parlors and my fish business... we can round the cash into US dollars... and ship product everywhere almost unnoticed. What can I do for you? Golden Triangle. So we're meeting a Zaibatsu, a leader in the banking world. - But who are we? - Obviously you're not a federal agent. Obviously I'm not a federal agent. Nobody knows what we do, and that's better. I want you to just play a role for me. You're my martial arts student. You're a fish out of water, trying to learn how to swim and that will be that. If it's okay, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions... about the local problems going on here. Do you think there's any possibility... that the Tongs and the Yakuza are getting into big business? Thank you so much, Sensei. I was hoping you'd say that. That's why I came. Thank you. - Travis. - Yeah? How's it going? Peachy keen. Hold them longer. Of course. Good. So, young man... you are his deshi? Deshi? His student. Yes, student. What have you studied? Kendo? Lyai. Kendo. Oh, yeah. What school? School? UCLA. Go, Bruins. What have you got? Jahto, look up the word. Tongs and Yakuza are working together. Got something for you. Be patient and leave me alone, all right? You have to understand something. A high government official was just assassinated. It's only natural that Intelligence would assume... terrorism may have been involved. So the Agency is gonna watch us until they decide... how the situation should turn out. - What, they decide? - That's right. 80% of the CIA's activity goes to disinformation. They pay close attention to the situation... and in the end they'll decide what happened... in order to fit their agenda. I'm gonna pull over here, I want you to jump in... take the driver's seat and drive. Go north, then swing back around and pick me up. - 15 minutes, you hear? - Yes, sir. Nayako-San, you look so beautiful today. Yeah, I know. Actually, I wanted to see if you could get any information... on the assassination of the Governor. I don't know if you know anybody... that has a good connection with the Yakuza? So, I love you. You be good. - Where is he? - He's leaving Fusion. - What's a fusion? - Fusion is Nayako's club. Good, she's an asset of his. We're gonna just jump into this little kissaten here. Sorry. Two cervezas, por favor. I'm sorry, I'm confused. Why're you taking me to all these places? This is my neighborhood, I grew up here. That's the truth. - No bullshit. - Yeah. That's great. But what does this have to do with the Governor's assassination? This neighborhood is the neighborhood... where all organized crime gathers and does their thing. We got Tongs, we got Yakuza. All kinds of organized crime, they are all centralized here. There is major struggle for turf. Major struggle for power. Most of that power comes from heroin. - Or as we call it here, Shabu. - Shabu. - Yeah. - So... Now you see, here's a perfect example. Our little Yakuza friend is back. Only this time, it seems like he's got two Chinese boys with him. That's strange. You would have never have seen that 10 years ago. Will you excuse me for just one second? You want to fight, come back in 10 years. Please tell me you're kidding. You didn't just have an AD. - Sorry, that was an accident. - Are you out of your mind? - I got excited. - You got excited? I've never seen or heard of such a thing. Look who's here. You're a cop, you deal with them. I don't exist. Fuck! One quick call to my boss, and everything is gonna be A-okay. A-okay? I need Block now. What the fuck did he do? Three Yakuza injured and two Chinese hanging out in Intensive Care? You should have seen him. God, he's fast. You fired a weapon in public. Shit like that could destroy everything we have with Japan. Sorry, that was an accident. Listen to this. American version of the current government is not acceptable. We'll continue to use force until our demands are met. You're clearly moving in the wrong direction. Has the lab heard this? What did they say? We're working on it. What makes you think we're moving in the wrong direction? This, for all we know, could be an attempt to mislead us. We don't know. So, if you don't mind, I'd like to go to the lab and check it out myself. - Go. - Thank you. From my Nayako I've heard a lot about you. She says you know a lot about the Yakuza. Kuroda. It seems like if this Kuroda has that much strength... and a direct connection with Myanmar... maybe he can eat all the other families and take over. This Kojima guy, is there any way you could maybe... get me a meeting with him? As long as I have total access to Burma... the Tongs are welcome to grow and prosper anywhere I have business. Together we win Japan. And eventually... America. My behavior... at the street market was unforgivable. My shame is beyond what I can describe. Please accept this as a token... of my regret. You're crazy. Not at all. Thank you for coming. Travis, they serve hamburgers here? I'm just going to wait outside. You found yourself a new deshi. What's up, dog? Yeah, don't worry about it. So, tell me about your boss in there. Boss? Yeah, your boss. Who you work for. Tell me about him. - Boss? - Never mind. Good morning, my darling. Here it is. No, you can't do this. It's just like it always is. You stay safe and you protect your anonymity. See you in a while. Okay. Bye. Sit. So, what's the problem? What is this? Some girl dropped it off. A mystery man sending me a letter... at your place. Strange. I'd like to stay. But I must go. I have other things to take care of. I'm sorry I asked you to come so suddenly. I just had some things I really wanted to talk to you about. Let's sit here. I wanna talk to you. Come, sit. You know... I've never had the best luck with women. In fact, you could probably say... I haven't had any luck at all. But for the first time in my life... I found somebody that I really love. You can call it a proposal. Yes, I'm proposing to you. So I guess that means yes. I'm very sorry... and all I can do is promise you a better life. I'm gonna quit this right away. One last piece of work, that's it, and then I'm finished. Together, we'll find some place really beautiful and quiet... and lead a great life together. Promise? Promise me... ...let's do Yubikiri vow. Hai. What can I do for you? I come to you on behalf of a friend who had the incident at the street market. I ask you as a favor that you remove yourself... from this incident's possible reprisal. Sit down, please. - Hi. - Hey. You know the guy that put our guys in the hospital? He's an American. The American at the street market? Yeah, he wants a truce. Sounds like a problem to me. That's what I think. He seems to want an answer right now. - Okay, take care of it. - No problem. Travis, sorry for interrupting you. It's kind of a sudden visit, isn't it? Is everything okay? Watch yourself. You've been asking a lot of questions on the street. Now... the street is starting to ask questions about you. Thanks for the warning. There is an abandoned hotel at the edge of town. We monitored it for the last few weeks. Kuroda's assassins are living on the second floor. It may be a place of interest to you. Thank you for that Intel, it's very nice of you. - How are you? - Fine. - Everything's going good here? - Yes. I bought this for you. It's a beautiful antique, It's from the Edo Period. Geishas have used this... and I thought of you because you wear a kimono so nicely. Thank you. - Travis. - That's okay. I'm so sorry to bother you, but check this out. Nice to meet you. I just got off the phone with the guys from the lab. Turns out that the tape was made at a fish market. Skigi, something like that. Maybe that rings a bell. But all that background noise apparently just gave the whole thing away. It would have been nice if you had called me. I'm here, I'm busy. I'm in the middle of something. Sorry about that. But I figured, being partners... I'm gonna give you one more chance. You go over there to the fish market... do some surveillance, take some pictures... long-lens, remote stuff. Don't be seen, and if it's good... - call me. - Okay, cool. And no more ADs. Nice to meet you. "Do some remote stuff with a long-lens... "take some pictures at the fish market." What does he think I am, a rookie? I hate this shit. No guns. Put the guns away. Put the guns away. - Hands up. - Okay. I'm an inspector. Move over here. Move over here! Come on, move over here. Back the fuck up. I don't speak your language, motherfucker. You're in a lot of trouble. Big trouble. I gotta report to my boss and you're not gonna like that. - You are dead. - Really? I don't exist. All right? It's a show time. Taxi! Taxi! Keep going. I'm on to something here. I found where the tape was made. It's a fish-packing warehouse. And get this, I found a finger... a severed pinkie finger wrapped in a piece of silk. I told you, "Do not go in there." I told you "remote surveillance." You know what remote surveillance means? What is wrong with you? If you get yourself killed on my watch, I'll kill you again. The battery's dying. I found a piece of paper with an address. It's like an invoice or something. I'm going to go check that out. Where's he going? If I didn't know any better, I'd say he's headed for the Ginza. Is he in an apartment building? Yeah. Our apartment building. How does he know she's there? You're not as sharp as you used to be. Sharp enough for you. You'd have kind of disappointed me if I'd got the drop on you. That's never gonna happen. You think? I like you much better like this. I like the delivery boy myself. The delivery boy was good. It was a very sexy touch. Why is Block having me follow you around Japan? United States government is always particularly fascinated in any enterprise... that could maybe bring income to their enemies. Why don't I go put on something more appropriate... and then we'll go to the office? And don't look at my ass. Do you like takoyaki? Let's go for a little drive. - What the fuck do you want? - What do you want... Mr. FBI? Are you looking for this? Fuck you. All right. Easy. Let's all take it easy here. What the fuck are you looking at, smiley? - Who, me? - Yeah, fuck you! Fuck me? Fuck me? Come on. Fuck me? Chen, are you crazy? Yeah, I'm crazy. Come on. My guess is the Governor's assassination was a ruse by Kuroda... to divert attention from him. What's this all about? This gives him a major alliance between the Yakuza and the Tongs... so that they could get a direct link for the heroin out of Burma. This is Kuroda's renovated temple just outside of Tokyo. - Sir. - Yeah. No one's seen the kid. That's because you had no surveillance at the fish market. He ain't around, and he's assigned to you. He's still working for me. I got him taking plates... and photographs. He'll be fine. That's fine. In the meantime... will you please tell me what you have got on the Yakuza? - I'm working on that. - Good. I'm glad. Travis, thank you for telling me. That's what I thought. Thank you. Holy cow. What the hell? Relax. Trust me. Trust you? Why? You got me into this shit. You broke the agent's neck. So... Are you prepared to take of the American if I take care of Kojima's boss? Yes. Fuck you! Time to go. You have woken the sleeping giant. Hey, Travis. Why are you so nervous? Hi, Fudomyo-O. These are Tongs. I don't want to put you in the middle of this... but when I signal you, you'll know what to do. Mei Ling, you set up the meeting. You come with me, handle the Chinese. In the back. - What are you doing here? - Little mistake. Why did you come here? I have no problem with the Yakuza here in Tokyo... but I thought it'd be better if I didn't have a problem with the Tongs. - But I'll leave that up to you. - So? We have Nayako. Really? If you have her, for your sake... I hope she's okay. We found Nayako. She's dead. Okay, find Travis. Using PLER to locate the asset. Come on, come on, come on. He's in a car. - Where now? - Heading east out of town. - You ready? - Yeah, I'm ready. Why don't we sneak in the back? 'Cause I'm not in the mood for surprises. I'm going right in the goddamn front door. See you in hell. Sushi. You guys really eat this crap? Are these your chopsticks? Looking for your friend? Fuck you. Let's go home. All right, tell me exactly what he did. By the looks of this place, it looks like he removed Kuroda completely. You know what to do. Fast and beautiful. I'll handle it. All right, let's move out. You got the gear. I'll take the right. In here. Start cleaning up. No DNA. Very clever. Really nice job. - What's this? - I don't know. It came with the other one. "Block, put this shield in the shadow box... "and tell his parents that Sean died valiantly in the line of duty. "Travis." Yeah, talk to me. Travis? Guess who.
