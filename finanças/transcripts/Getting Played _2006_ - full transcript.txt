I GOT IT. OK. OH, I'M SUCH A KLUTZ. ARE YOU SURE IT WAS ACTUALLY HER? YOU SAID YOU REALLY DIDN'T SEE THEM. BELIEVE ME, I MANAGED TO GET A GOOD LOOK WHEN I WALKED THROUGH THE FRONT, OK? IT WAS HER FOR SURE. SO, WE MADE A DATE FOR DINNER, AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, I'M FEELING PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THINGS RIGHT NOW. HA HA. IT'S NOT FAIR. WHAT'S NOT FAIR? IT'S HAPPENING TO YOU AND NOT ME. WHAT CAN I SAY? GOD LOVES ME, J. DON'T PLAY LIKE THAT. SO, WHERE Y'ALL GO? I TOOK HER TO THIS SEXY PLACE ON MELROSE. I KNEW SHE'D LIKE THAT. BUT LET ME EXPLAIN. THIS WOMAN ISN'T JUST BEAUTIFUL, MAN. SHE'S RADIANT. AND SHE'S A PROFESSIONAL ACTRESS, SO SHE GOT TO BE FINE. ANYWAY, SHE'S FLIRTING. SHE'S BUMPING HER LEG ON MY LEG UNDER THE TABLE OR WHATEVER, YOU KNOW? AND NOT ENOUGH TO BE OBVIOUS, BUT JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP A MAN PLAYING CLOSE ATTENTION. RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT. SO, THIS IS WHERE I TAKE IT OVER THE TOP. I MAKE UP THIS STORY ABOUT MY FIANCéE AND HOW SHE DUMPED ME FOR MY BEST FRIEND. AND I'M PRACTICALLY IN TEARS, AND I KNOW IT'S A BUNCH OF BULL. DENZEL AIN'T GOT NOTHING ON ME, DAWG. THAT'S MY BOY! SO, WHAT HAPPENED AFTER DINNER? BOY, WHERE HAS THE TIME GONE? YOU KNOW, J, I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE. HEY, LOOK, LOOK, DON'T PLAY, OK? YOU AIN'T GOING NOWHERE. WHAT HAPPENED? TELL ME. SHE PRACTICALLY RIPPED MY CLOTHES OFF. UH-UH. SHE CAME OUT THE BATHROOM. SHE'S STANDING THERE IN HER BRA AND PANTIES LOOKING LIKE SHE STEPPED OUT OF VICTORIA'S SECRET. OOH. TYRA BANKS ON STEROIDS, EVERYTHING MATCHING. SWEET TOES. OOH. SWEET TOES? I'M, LIKE, YOU KNOW, "MAYBE... MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT." SHE'S, LIKE, "I WANT YOU NAKED NOW." WHOA. AND THEN WHAT? YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW? YES, I DO. WHEW. HOW LONG YOU BEEN KNOWING ME, MAN? A LONG TIME. AND YOU COULD SAY ROUGHLY I'M AN EXPERIENCED GUY, RIGHT? YEAH. LET ME BE HONEST, J. WE DID THINGS. SUCH AS? THINGS. WHAT KIND OF THINGS? I'M FREAKED OUT JUST THINKING ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW, MAN. WELL, TRY HARD. LET ME JUST SAY, WE... WE INVENTED NEW POSITIONS. I NEED TO SEE MY CHIROPRACTOR RIGHT NOW. HOW MANY? JOSH, A REAL GENTLEMAN DOES NOT TELL HIS BUSINESS. THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM, MARK. WHATEVER. ANYWAY, WHAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW WAS, WHEN SHE WENT IN THE BATHROOM, I FOUND THE VIDEO CAMERA WHICH I KNEW WOULD BE THERE. SHE HID THE CAMERA? AMAZING HOW DEVIOUS SOME PEOPLE CAN BE, HUH? YEAH. SO, I UNPLUGGED THE VIDEO FEED. ARE YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T DREAM ALL THIS? DREAM? IT WAS REAL. I'VE ALREADY MET BACHELORETTE NUMBER 2. SHE PRETENDED TO BE IN THE MARKET FOR A HOUSE, SO I GAVE HER A GUIDED TOUR. HA HA! SMART GIRL. SO, WHAT DID SHE LOOK LIKE? WHOO! MMM, MMM, MMM. LIKE THAT? LIKE THAT. [KISSES] MMM. WHEW. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. SO, WHEN'S THE NEXT DATE? THIS SATURDAY. I WOULD SAY, "WISH ME LUCK," BUT THERE'S REALLY NO NEED TO, BECAUSE AS YOU CAN SEE, I'M DOING WELL. HA HA! DON'T DO THAT. DON'T HATE, JACK. UM, ANY CHANCE OF YOU AND KIM GETTING BACK TOGETHER? YEAH. I MEAN, I DON'T LIKE BEING BY MYSELF. AND LATE AT NIGHT WHEN I'M AT HOME, MAN, I'VE BEEN OVERUSING MY PALM PILOT. UHH. I'M SERIOUS. I'M STARTING TO GET ARTHRITIS IN BOTH HANDS. THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION, J. I DON'T NEED TO KNOW ALL THAT, MAN. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH PLEASURING YOURSELF, MARK. CHECK. AHEM. I'M ONLY HUMAN, OK? AND I GOT SEXUAL NEEDS THAT'S GOT TO BE SATISFIED. CHECK! ANY CHECK, PLEASE. I GOT A CALLUS ON THIS ONE RIGHT HERE. HELP! [CROWD CHEERING] OK. IF YOU EVER FALL IN LOVE WITH A YOUNG BOY, AND HE DROP YOU, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU HOW YOU GET BACK AT HIM. HAVE SEX WITH HIS FATHER. OH, THAT'LL HURT HIM, THAT'LL HURT HIM. HE COME HOME FROM THE CLUB LATE ONE NIGHT. HIS FATHER GOT ONE OF THEM OLD BOBBY WOMACK, GENE CHANDLER RECORDS ON. HE FIGURES DADDY IN THERE HAVING SEX WITH SISTER JENKINS FROM THE CHURCH. THAT'S WHEN I COME BOUNCING OUT, LOOK AT HIM, AND GO, "YOUR DADDY SAID TAKE THE GARBAGE OUT BEFORE YOU GO TO BED." THAT'LL KILL HIM. WHEN HE'S BUSY, I'M EASY. YOU CAN HAVE SEX WITH ME ON THE HOOD OF A CAR. YOU JUST NEED TO KEEP THE CAR RUNNING, SO MY BACK DON'T GET COLD. I'M EASY LIKE THAT. MMM! AND THEN, LADIES, YOU NEED TO FIX YOURSELF UP. YOU NEED TO LOOK GOOD. WHY? BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK GOOD, YOU FEEL GOOD. WEAR SOME DANG MAKEUP. I KNOW I GOT TO WEAR MAKEUP, BECAUSE WITHOUT MAKEUP, I LOOK EXACTLY LIKE WESLEY SNIPES. WEAR SOME MAKEUP. SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP. LOOK AT THE WHITE PEOPLE GOING, "I KNEW I KNEW HER. EITHER SHE WAS IN BLADE, OR..." HA HA! LADIES... WE NEED TO STOP PLAYING GAMES WITH OUR LOVE. Y'ALL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. Y'ALL KNOW WHAT GAME I'M TALKING ABOUT. YOU GO OUT WITH A GOOD MAN. HE A DECENT MAN. YOU DONE ATE UP ALL THE STEAK AND LOBSTER. THEN WHEN IT'S TIME TO HAVE SEX, YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT JESUS AND THE DIRECTION OF YOUR LIFE. YOU'S A TRICKY WENCH. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE MESSING IT UP FOR DECENT PROS LIKE MYSELF. SEE, WHEN A MAN GET HIS FEELINGS HURT, HE DON'T CHANGE FOR THE BETTER. HE CHANGE FOR THE WORSE, SO WHEN I GO OUT WITH HIM, NOW HE'S A BITTER BUSTER. NOW I CAN BARELY GET A HAPPY MEAL AND SNICKER BAR OUT THIS BITTER BUSTER, AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT. IT'S NOT RIGHT. STOP MESSING WITH YOUR MAN WHILE HE WATCHING TV. GIVE YOUR MAN HIS SPACE. WHEN YOUR MAN IS WATCHING TV, FIX HIM SOME SNACKS AND GET OUT THE WAY. DON'T TRY TO TALK TO YOUR MAN WHILE HE WATCHING TV. NEVER ASK YOUR MAN THIS QUESTION... "WHAT YOU THINKING 'BOUT?" YOU KNOW WHY? HE CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT HE THINKING ABOUT WHEN YOU SAY, "WHAT YOU THINKIN' 'BOUT?" BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANT TO SAY? "I WAS THINKING YOU NEED TO GET YOUR ACT "OUT OF THE FRONT OF THE DANG TV "WHILE I'M TRYING TO WATCH THE GAME, "BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT TO YOU, "BECAUSE I'M GOING TO WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES WHEN THE GAME GO OFF." OWNING A RESTAURANT, THAT'S EXCITING. NOT ALWAYS. DEALING WITH THE STAFF... THE CHEF, WAITERS, BUSBOYS, BARTENDERS. QUALITY IS EVERYTHING. MMM. THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS VERY COMPETITIVE. SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY. YOU MUST BE GOOD AT IT. I AM... BUT IT'S NO LONGER MY REAL PASSION. SO, WHAT IS LAUREN'S REAL PASSION? I RECENTLY BECAME INVOLVED WITH THE HOMELESS. YOU KNOW, FUNDRAISING, BUILDING AWARENESS. WHEN I THINK OF PEOPLE GOING HUNGRY, IT BREAKS MY HEART. WHEW. I'VE DONE WELL FOR MYSELF, AND I WANT TO GIVE SOMETHING BACK. THAT REMINDS ME. I HAVE SOME FRIENDS WHO VOLUNTEER AT THE MISSION DOWNTOWN, AND THEY HAND OUT MEALS. THEY'RE OUT THERE HELPING OUT. HOW ABOUT YOU AND I GO DOWN THERE TOGETHER SO YOU CAN MEET THEM? I'D LOVE TO. [BOTH LAUGH] WHAT'S WRONG? OHH. I MAY HAVE HAD ONE DRINK TOO MANY. MMM. HEADACHE? A LITTLE. OOH. YOU WOULDN'T BE DISAPPOINTED IF WE MADE IT AN EARLY NIGHT? NO! I MEAN, IT'S JUST THAT...

THAT DAY YOU WALKED IN THE RESTAURANT, THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU, I THOUGHT... "WOW. HE LOOKS SO NICE, CONFIDENT, TOGETHER." YOU KNOW, IT'S SILLY, BUT SOMETIMES YOU JUST GET A FEELING ABOUT SOMEONE, EVEN FROM ACROSS THE ROOM. LISTEN, IF YOU NEVER WANT TO SPEAK TO ME AGAIN, I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND. EMILY, I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, AND I HOPE THAT... WHEN I TELL YOU THIS, YOU'LL FIND IT IN YOUR HEART TO FORGIVE ME. FORGIVE YOU? FOR WHAT? WHEN YOU WERE AT THE RESTAURANT WITH YOUR GIRLFRIENDS... [NO AUDIO] I FELT REALLY BAD ABOUT IT... NOT TELLING YOU THE WHOLE THING. EMILY. OHH. EMILY! YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CAMERAS. AND THERE'S NO DANG SOUND. EMILY, EMILY. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. EMILY, EMILY, EMILY. LISTEN, LISTEN, PLEASE. JUST PLEASE. SIT HERE. COME ON, BABY. SIT HERE. WHAT THE... EXCUSE ME. EMILY... I DIDN'T PLAN ANY OF THIS. IT JUST HAPPENED. Man: YOU KNOW HIM? I MEAN, I HEARD YOUR VOICES, I LOOKED OVER. I SAW 3 BEAUTIFUL LADIES TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY EACH WERE GONNA HAVE SEX WITH THE NEXT GUY THAT WALKS IN THE DOOR. 3 OF 'EM? HONESTLY, I GOT CAUGHT UP, OK? WHAT WAS I TO DO? EMILY, A GUY LIKE ME... I'D BE LUCKY TO MEET ONE OF YOU IN A LIFETIME, MUCH LESS 3. Man: OH, THEY'RE FREAKS! I THINK ANY MAN IN MY POSITION WOULD'VE AT LEAST CONSIDERED THE SAME THING. LOOK, MY MAN, IF 3 BEAUTIFUL WOMEN WANTED TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU, WOULD THAT BE A PROBLEM? FOR ME? NO. BUT FOR MY WIFE? SHE DON'T GET DOWN LIKE THAT NO MORE, PLAYER. DON'T TELL 'EM MY... UM... HEH. WAIT A MINUTE. MAYBE WE SHOULD LET THEM HAVE THIS TABLE. NO. I'M SORRY. I APOLOGIZE. WE'RE RUINING YOUR DINNER. NO, NOT REALLY, MAN. THIS IS OFF THE CHAIN. I LOVE THIS. WAIT, WAIT, GEORGE, GEORGE, DON'T YOU GET IT? THIS IS ONE OF THOSE, UH, HIDDEN CAMERA TV SHOWS. YOU KIDDIN'! NO! WHERE THE CAMERA AT? I DON'T KNOW. THEY HIDE 'EM SOMEWHERE. OH! OFF THE CHAIN. EMILY... OH. GLAD I WORE MY NICE DRESS. YOU SAID IT YOURSELF. YOU'RE AS GUILTY AS I AM. AND THE WAY I SEE IT, IF IT WASN'T FOR YOUR CONTEST, WE WOULDN'T HAVE MET. EMILY, PLEASE. I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU. OHH. GO AHEAD. FORGIVE HIM, GIRL. HE SEEMS LIKE A NICE GUY. AND Y'ALL LOOK GREAT TOGETHER. I MEAN, PERFECT. BETTER THAN PERFECT. Y'ALL DO. HEH. EMILY... I HAVE NEVER SAID THIS TO ANYONE IN MY LIFE. WHEN I LOOK AT YOU, I SEE EVERYTHING I'VE EVER WANTED. HEY, I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS. BUT THE ONE THING THAT I AM SO SURE OF IS THAT I WANT A CHANCE TO HAVE YOU IN MY LIFE. OH. THAT IS SO SWEET. WHY YOU NEVER SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT? THIS IS TV, GIRL. THIS AIN'T REAL. GET YOUR MIND RIGHT. SHUT UP. EMILY, UNLESS I'M WRONG, YOU DO HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME, DON'T YOU? GOOD. THAT IS GOOD. SO, UH... HOW ABOUT, UH, WE START OVER? YOU KNOW? NO MORE GAMES. TOTAL HONESTY FROM HERE ON. GO, GIRL. GIVE HIM ANOTHER SHOT. EMILY, YOU COULD DO THAT. IT'S WORTH IT. HEH. GO AHEAD. WHY DON'T WE GO FOR A WALK? YEAH. COME ON. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. WHERE Y'ALL GOIN'? HEY, HEY, WHERE YOU GOIN'? THE SHOW JUST STARTED. WE GOT 30 MINUTES, DON'T WE? ALL RIGHT, NOW. Y'ALL WAS GOOD, THOUGH. THAT WAS GOOD. THAT WAS A GOOD PERFORMANCE. Y'ALL WERE DA BOMB!
