(electronic music playing) Come on Hey Dostoyevsky, you are shaking. Lost your balance, huh? Everyone was shaking. The music was too good. Okay then. Behave at the wedding, okay. No more bachelor parties. - Okay? - Okay. Don't forget the wedding date. I'll leave day after tomorrow. - So when is the wedding? - Wedding! Er... - August 17th, dude! - Sorry, bro! Dasthu, are you okay? Should I drop you? - Are you blind? I'm cool. - Okay. Many rivers have emptied into this sea, my friend. - Yet you ask me this. - Okay, dude. - Is your driver okay? - Yeah, he is. - Can he drive safely? - He is good, man. - Did he drink secretly? - Hey, no. - Sure? - Yeah. - Should I drop you? - No, carry on. Okay, goodnight. - Bye. - Okay. - Call me when you reach. - Yeah. Come on, let's go. Allah! GO! (a prayer recital in Arabic) (a way of healing practiced by some sections of Muslims) Ustad? - When did you come? - I've been here for a while. Ustad, are we in heaven or hell? God has given you extra time to decide that. While you were knocked out... I'll tell you what happened here. Everyone knows it wasn't the cat's fault... but you were drunk at the time of accident. Not just your friends and family Even your fiancee's family heard about it. So they have called off the wedding. Your father wasn't able to bear the humiliation... so he stopped going to his shop. That poor man decided to return to his hometown. The police report said you had consumed alcohol. So they replaced you at work. Now there is only one way before you. It's the way of faith. I'll command... and you will obey. You can manage your father's shop... for the time being. And until you marry... at least for the sake of convincing others come to the mosque often. This is your last chance. Be afraid. Be afraid of the bridge called 'Sirat Al- Mustaqeem'. Be afraid that if you fall off that bridge... you will go down into the hot fire of hell. Ustad? I'll never lose my way again. Praise be to God! All will be well. Don't worry. I'm with you. Allah! Chandretta? Allah! Chandretta? Chandretta? What happened? Sister? - Dilruba? - Papa? - Papa? - What happened? What is it, papa? I'm alright. Go and do the ablution. We'll do the morning prayer together. Hurry up! I said 'Hurry up'. This might be my last prayer with my kids. Don't worry, Dasthakeer. It must be gas. Gas, huh? - Will you call an ambulance? - Ambulance? Call an ambulance, Chandretta. What the... Oh God, I've young children. Don't do this to me, Allah! Sorry, doctor. Chandran here. - What is it, Chandran? - Dasthakeer says he has a chest pain. Is it real or... I think it's real this time. He told me to call an ambulance. - I called you instead. - What is he doing now? Let me check. 'Allahu Akbar!'* *(God is Great) He is offering prayer with his children. He thinks it might be the last time. So he is healthy enough to do that? Don't bother to call the ambulance. Do one thing. Bring him to my clinic at 8 am. He will call me names if I don't call an ambulance. Nothing to worry. How many times have you called for an ambulance before? At the most, he may die. It's better than dying so many times. 'Allahu Akbar!' (salutation at the end of prayer) The details of every loan given and taken are in here. I may not be able to give it later. Really, Dasthakeer? You are absolutely fine. Did you ever have a cardiac arrest? I pray it never happens. But that's how I want to go. Like a fuse blowing! Don't inform Sulekha if anything happens to me. You know, Dasthakeer... it's her absence that is bothering you. Just tell me the word... I'll go to Qusais and bring her back tomorrow itself. I'll kill you! She can come see my dead body. She left me and my kids over a silly fight. Sulekha went to stay with her parents, right? Where is the ambulance, Chandretta? It will be here soon. Go to bed, kiddos. Your papa is fine. Go to bed. Go. See you, papa. See... See you? Maybe in heaven. When will I see them again, Chandretta? - Where is the ambulance, Chandretta? - It will come. - When? - Soon. - Dasthakeer? - Oh? You know how difficult it is to run a hospital in this country? Building rent, staff salary... License fee, current bill... Then my salary. Oh no, doctor. I don't need a discount this time. - But please cure this. - It's not what you think. We sustain because of chronic patients like you. You had a panic attack due to fear and anxiety. Attack? See I told you. But you were... I meant anxiety attack. Or madness in Malayalam. Every disease has its roots here. If you keep your hard disk virus- free and cool... you will be free from diseases also. But don't tell anyone else. Or we'll go out of work. - You mean I'm okay, doctor? - Of course. I told you I'm fine. You always stress me out. - Now I'm the culprit, huh? - Excuse me? - Dasthakeer? - Oh? Go home, take a shower and go to your shop. You have to make money for the next check- up. Go! - Thank you, doctor. Shake hands? - Oh okay. - I trust you. - Okay. - Where do I pay the bill? - Ah! - I'll call you after two days. - No need of that. Doctor, do you know any good psychiatrist? Psychiatrist! Why? You told me I've some mental disorder. YOU! - No need. - Don't drive our doctor mad. GO! Isn't yoga good for positive energy? Yoga or circus, do whatever you like. Go now. Come on, don't do your circus here. Bye! Inhale! Exhale! Exhale! Inhale! See you tomorrow morning at 7 am. - Sharp, okay? - Thank you - Thank you. - Thank you. - Pranamam*! *(salutation) - Allah! - Ravi, how are you? - Fine, Guruji. - Hi, Dasthakeer. - Hi! How do you feel? I feel good, sir. Very refreshing! Do you get angry? To be honest anger and stress are still there. Do you take deep breaths when you are angry? Yes, many times. Do you count from 1 to 10 in your mind? I even count aloud. My situation is getting worse, sir. Everything's wrong. - Shall I give you a special tip? - Ah. Tell me, sir. - It's not in the syllabus. - Oh! When you can't control your anger... take a fragile plate... move to a safe place and smash it on the floor. - Eh? - You think it's crazy? Yes, but it's effective. You will feel free like letting off steam from a pressure cooker. At first you will break a lot of plates. Then it will reduce... your anger and the number of plates. But how can I do this before my children and staff? Do it where nobody can see you. Then pick up a broom. And gather the broken pieces from every nook and corner. Then you will feel calm. That's the highlight. - Is this scientific, sir? - Yes. - It really is scientific. - Oh! It's called the deliberated pressure releasing technique. Tell me the result once you have tried. Chandretta, the horn works fine. You can use it, you know. Yeah. Turn. Sulu! As if he is seeing it for the first time! Good day, Chandretta. Have a wonderful day. I'm fully charged. Come on. - Good morning, brother. - Good morning. - 'Assalamu alaikum', boss. - 'Wa alaikum assalam'. Good morning, brother. There is an old bill. Some people have nothing new. That's why they bring up old things. Don't remind me of the past, Tito. - So even arrears are old? - Past is past! How much for today's stock? Live in the present, man. Stop kidding, brother. There is pressure from company... and from my family back home. One solution to all problems: Yoga! What! If you breathe in lots of oxygen your lungs won't turn into sponge. If you don't give me oxygen now the company will cut off mine. Give me some time, dear. Is it too much? This is enough for today. Okay? Trying to fool me, huh? Chandretta? Will you manage the counter? There is one offer, madam. Buy 3, take 1 free. - Oh, I see. - Yes. And we have free home delivery. - Any single item we will give you. - Oh okay. 'Assalamu alaikum'. 'Wa alaikum assalam'. Eat a full kilo then I can cut from your salary. Sathar? Take some of these and put them in the car. Okay. - Make sure they don't break. - Ah. Call the electrician, Chandretta. It must be a short circuit. - I can do it, boss. - You know to do it? Yes, I did electrician course from Karachi. - Oh great! - Excuse me? Electrician course from Karachi! Let him do it, Chandretta. - We should encourage such talents. - Oh sure! - Then do it quickly. - I'll bring the ladder. We have skilled workers with us. Ya Allah! 'Bismillah'*! *(In the name of God) Oh my God! - Dasthakeer? - Where is that *** from Karachi? Is the power gone? I'll tear you into pieces. Check all plug points wires and fuses, Raju. Cut the wire to the DB. Please come at once here One minute. Stop smiling. - Cool now? - Yes, Josetta. - Come. - Why? I've to tell you something. It's destiny, Josetta. When we had a situation you were in our neighbourhood. - Aha! - And you worked for us for free. Today before I came to work - I just went through the Bible. - That's good. And I read these words 'Beware of the Satan's tricks.' Allah! If you had turned two pages you will see, 'Love thy neighbour.' I'm your good neighbour, right? I'm right here, Josetta. I'm not running away. - We will see again. - You are so sly! - Carry on, Josetta. - Okay. Murali sir? - You stopped visiting since holidays. - I got transferred to Kuwait. Oh God! You were one of my loyal customers. There is a small problem, Dasthakeer. What is it, sir? I had purchased some furniture last month. Can you help me dispose it? Even if used for only a month they are second- hand now. Just empty the flat. I don't want any money. - Then let me see. - Please be quick, okay. Or I may have to spend out of my pocket to dispose it. Okay. Shareef, son? When are you shifting to the new house? Not sure, brother. I'm short of money. - My family will come next week. - Is that so? What's your budget? About 2000 'dirhams'. Take 1500 out of it. We will see. Okay? I'll call you. 'Assalamu alaikum'. - Lift it. - Yeah, here. Go away - Take that fridge also. - Okay. I'm doing it. Hurry up, Chandretta. What's this? - Come on, Noushad. - Not good, move. - I'll do it, boss. - This way. Get lost! - Come on, let's do it. - What's inside this? Oh no! Why are you standing there? Come and help us. Back off, everybody! I think he is planning to drag it up. Awesome! 'Green' took 4 wickets in a single ball. Are you counting down the money? You solved my problem just like that. - Anytime! - Calls for a selfie. Are you taking a selfie or short film? That will do. I'll post it to Facebook and make you famous. I'll kill you if you post it to Facebook. - Hey, pay up the vehicle. - Okay, brother. Such a selfless man! Give 1000 'dirhams' to Josettan. Remaining 500 for workshop. What happened? Nothing. (Song on radio) - 'Assalamu alaikum'. - 'Wa alaikum assalam'. Ustad, I've a doubt. Will your doubts ever end, Dasthakeer? Doubts are a sign of lack of faith. No, ustad... One man gave away his furniture for free. We sold it at a reasonable price to another man. So what? Is it the right thing to do? I feel like I cheated both of them. One man gave it to you for free. Another got it at a reasonable price. There's no cheating in it. It's totally right. Such deals are part and parcel of business, Dasthakeer. Thank you. Now I feel relaxed. When are you visiting Dubai, ustad? I'm going to Kuwait next week. Then off to Qatar the week after. I'll be in Dubai the first week of next month. - To inaugurate a hotel. - Ah. I'll call you. - How is your business? - It's bad, ustad. Oh, don't worry, son. I'll prayer for you. Your business will flourish. Don't worry. Be 'CORNFIDENTE'! Okay, ustad. - I feel fully charged when I talk to... - Hey, don't hang up. Hello? I'll send the model of a mobile phone on your WhatsApp. Buy one for me. My nephew Ansar is coming home next week. You can send it through him. Okay, ustad. Hang up. It's from Dubai. Dasthakeer My charge has drained off again. Don't laugh, okay. Good morning! Not a good morning! This devil was the first thing I saw. - I'll kill this one today. - But it's our poor Sulekha's cat. Poor who? Sulekha or this cat? Both. - Are the kids up? - No. Sweetie... wake up. Hey! This stupid headset! Dilruba? Allah! What is this! Good morning! 'Aiyo'! It's 'dosa' again? Then? Were you out stealing last night? Is this the time for homework? Come on, eat! Where is the princess? Very good! You look great! Now come here. 'Dosa!' My book? Yeah. Here you go, son. - Don't forget anything, okay. - Nope. It's mama. Answer it. - Brother, your hair! - I'm answering it, okay? - Good morning! - Good morning! What did you have for breakfast? 'Dosa.' Is that what he gives you every day? Aseem? Did you brush your teeth? I promise I did. - Yesterday. - Hey, Ruba... Didn't I tell you not to apply eyeliner while going to school? Come on, take it off! But all my friends do it, mama. But I don't want you to do it. Oh, you took my make- up set too? Why do you go to school? For beauty contest or studying? - Mama, I... - Go and wash your face. I said, go wash your face. - You don't allow me to do anything. - Happy now? You know what? Your papa is too easy on you. That's the problem. Where is that man? He is here. I hope your papa has realised how I looked after this family. - With two eyes, how else? - Has he left? - Hello, where are you taking the plates? - Won't tell. What is this? Dasthakeer, what are you going to do with those plates? Move! (plates crashing) Aiyo! What's that sound? I think it was your cat. Oh the cat? Don't forget to feed the cat, okay? Alright. We are getting late for school. - Shall I hang up? - Okay. We will talk in the evening. - Bye. - Bye. - Where is the broom? - What is it? Go away! Oh, he broke the plates. - Are you feeling good, Chandretta? - Oh yes. I feel good too. I'll put it back. How are you feeling, kids? I feel so calm. Sister? You are pretty without make- up. There's the pet shop I said. It's run by an Afghan man. Why didn't he open shop in the city? Who will come so far to buy pets? - Bye, papa. - Bye. - Bye. Oh! We just delivered half of the day's load. But this load is entirely your making. - What did you say? - This is the problem. You have a bad temper. No wonder she left you. I'll kick you so hard you will end up in Aluva Manappuram. Are you smiling? That will be very helpful. I can save money on my trip. From there I'll go home to my wife and kids. And return by the next flight. - Sorry, madam... - What sorry? - Where is your owner? - It's our mistake. - I apologise. - I want to talk to your owner. - What is it? - Are you the boss? If you don’t know how to do business then look for some other job. What happened, madam? I ordered vanilla ice- cream you gave me chocolate ice- cream. I ordered tea you gave me coffee. Do you think I'm here to dance to your tunes? I'll complaint to the municipal authorities and get them to close your shop. Sorry madam, our mistake. I sending you everything you ordered. Sorry, madam. Good day to you. Sorry... Which fool delivered the order to Al Manzil? 'Green' took the order but I delivered it. He took the order, you delivered it but I paid for it. You better deliver everything she ordered. Don't take any money, okay? I'll cut it from your salary. Salary cut! Understood? - Understood, sir. - Understood! - Oh no, papa is back! - Hey, papa is here. Oh dear! It's him! (children reading aloud) They heard the car that's why. Trying to fool me! I was way naughtier as a kid. (children reading aloud) I totally fell for it, okay. Don't stop. Carry on with your acting. At least then you will read something. - Awesome! - 'Aiyo' Are you caught? What? Is your mouth watering? We are not feeling hungry. You mean you aren't hungry or none of you is? We all don't feel hungry. Okay, don't eat if you aren't hungry. - Chandretta? - Yeah. Keep their dinner in the fridge. - Let them have it for breakfast. - Oh. You won't starve to death if you skip dinner. Get up now. So no need of 'dosa' in the morning? Let them have the rice gruel itself. Let's have it or we won't even get 'dosa' for breakfast. We will have this. Not a single drop should be wasted. We don't feel hungry! You don't know what hunger is. That's why you are so vain. And one more thing. Wash your plates after eating. Chandrettan is not your servant. You are grown- up now. But still you make him do all the work. We got here too late, kids. That's why. Tomorrow I'll make your favourites. - Have that gruel now. - Your favourite, right? Hello... you have to find a maid. The kids are finding it so hard. And what about you? It's so difficult to find a good person. Tintu! Chotti! (Dilruba reading aloud) Mimo? Chotti? Diana? Eat, my darling. Eat! Eat, sweetheart. Diana? Diana, come on, eat. How do you know her name Diana? How do you know? I know. - You! Run home, silly cat. - Hey, don't hurt her. Stop there. (Rumi reading aloud) - I'll... - What is it, papa? Stop there. I'll make a pickle of you today. Where are you going? Yeah, I know right. I saw your message. - Yeah, me too. - Yeah. Put it there. Sit down. Who is that guy? He is my friend, papa. Just friend or boyfriend? He said he wants to marry me. Oh, that's nice. When is the wedding? Will you invite your father? Not now, papa. Maybe after 2 or 3 years. - When we are matured. - Good! That's a good decision. He doesn't like to study. He is more interested in business. He will buy a flat in Dubai and give it to me as 'mehr*'. (*gift) Arabs don't accept dowry. Do you know they give money to the bride's family? That's 'mehr'. So... all planned? Easy for me. - How old are you? - 15 and he's now 18. In a few years we will be legally eligible for marriage. Is it? Yes, papa. I'm trying to help you, papa. - Is it? - I know your financial problems. You'll need a lot of money to marry me to someone back home. So when he proposed I thought it's a better idea. That's why I accepted. So you accepted? - You are in 10th class, right? - Hmm. - Don't you have a lot to study? - Ah! You need to earn a degree, right? So it will take another 5- 6 years. - So you want me to wait till then? - Yes. So don't get involved in it. And don't contact that guy anymore. - You got it? - Mama! Your mama left you. But your papa is still here. Stop wetting the bed first. Proposal, my foot! I'll give you... Dasthakeer... come here. - Come on. - My plate... - I need to speak to you. - But my plate... - Leave it there. You can break it later. I'll be back. Dasthakeer? Girls her age need their mothers to look after them. There are no serious issues between you and Sulekha. Go and bring her back. Now don't break the plates. Sulu? What? What's your problem actually? I don't have any problem. Will any woman leave her family over slight differences? - Who told you I left? - No? You always say I've nothing to do at home. Do you now understand the value of a stay- at- home mother? You are valuable... priceless. Sulu, I want to tell you something. Dilruba is grown- up. I'm unable to handle her age. I'm worried about her. You have always blamed my parenting. It's your chance to raise the kids scientifically. Do it and enjoy it. Don't make me lose my temper, Sulu. Learn to control your anger first. Until then, I need a break. I'll never get angry again. I promise, Sulu. Please come back. Okay, I'll think about it. No need of that. You are an arrogant woman, Sulu. I hope you realise it someday. You need time to think, huh? Keep thinking... don't stop, okay? Don't be mad, pal. You just told me you will never be angry again. Learn to respect your woman, man. Go tell someone else. 'Tune into Gold 101.3 FM - Sulu' Now what's this? 'Welcome back!' 'It's Meera Nandan on Gold 101.3 FM.'

"On a low- hanging dewy branch" "At the tip of a tasseled leaf" "Oh, love- struck sparrow" "Who says softly on her own" "Where is your mate, where is your friend" Mate is in her father's home! (mumbles indistinctly) "Where is your mate, where is your friend" "Oh, bejeweled sparrow" "On a low- hanging dewy branch" Anas 'musaliyar*' of Aluva has proposed a match for you. (cleric) But you promised we won't discuss marriage until I finish college. That's true but things have changed now. Your brothers borrowed my retirement benefits for business. They are doing well but they don't want to pay it back. - You are just imagining things. - No, I'm not. Some marriage proposals via my friends didn't work. I was shocked when I came to know why. Your brothers were behind it. They feared they will have to pay me back at the time of your marriage. That's why they did it. I don't understand how my sons could be so cruel. If anything happens to me... they will marry you off to a random guy to get rid of you. I'm sure. So please don't say no. He runs his own supermarket. Somewhat educated also. - But... - But what? He got into trouble some time back. But ustad guarantees he has mended his ways. I don't force you. Whether it's this guy or someone else... I won't go ahead unless you are happy. You think about it. But don't be too long to decide. 'Aiyo!' - Where is the driver? - Just put it in the trunk. Oh, no driver! So I'll have to do it. This woman is Fast & Furious! Hello? Do you have powdered asafoetida for 'sambar' curry? 'Aiyo!' No, but we have 'sambar' powder so you needn't add asafetida. - So you will decide that? - No... This shop doesn't have any basic items. Papaya, guava, finger banana... You don't even have banana stem! Stem? Who will marry such a merchant? I didn't recognise you, madam. Who are you? How are you related to Anas 'musaliyar' of Aluva? He is my ustad. Your ustad is my father's friend. He sent us your marriage proposal. When you come home to see me you will act very decent. So I decided to come here and study everything about you. So what did you learn? - Just let it be. - Okay. Before I decide if you are that super lucky guy who will marry me... There are a few things I want you to know. - Only then we will proceed. - What are your conditions, madam? I'm a final- year degree student. So if our 'nikah*' is solemnized (Islamic marriage contract) I won't allow you to touch me until I complete my studies. - Next? - Then... you should allow me to go to work. Anything else? I don't like merchants in general. I really don't like busy businessmen who come home late. You should reach home before 7 pm and work out. After a bath you should take me out for a ride in the car. Then I want to eat out once in a week. And occasionally, watch a movie in theatre. Is that all? We don't want kids for the first three years. It's for us to enjoy! Then we can have as many as we want. You seem well- planned? You do one thing, princess... Some bashful prince will come... shoot with a bow and arrow and sweep you off your feet. Spare me the trouble! You have no idea who Dasthakeer is. Got it? - Hello? - You called? - I know exactly who Dasthakeer is. - How? Don't you have a T- shirt that reads 'I love spirit- uality'? Now you look like a 'musaliyar'. But I know that you got drunk and almost died in a car accident. Please don't say it aloud. I also know your fiancee called off the wedding after that. Now none of the rich girls will marry you. So you think about it. Until then you'll be on my waiting list. Dasthakeer, dude? Good day to you! "He saw a 'hijabi' girl in his dreams" "He saw a moonlight swathed in darkness" "He saw a 'hijabi' girl in his dreams" You got a call, sweetie. It's Dasthakeer. Hey, come here. Hello? Hey... If I marry you, how will it go? War or peace? No idea! Whatever I'm now I owe it to ustad. If I surrender before a girl like you... I may become a better man. So... So... So I surrender before you. Why don't you say something? Don't get me wrong. And don't tell your father.

Chandretta, stop honking. You want the Arab to tick you off? - 'Assalamu alaikum.' - 'Wa alaikum assalam.' - Sorry brother, we are returning to Egypt. - All the best! - Just give me 15 minutes. - It's okay, no problem. - Thank you. - Take your own time. Chandretta, they are shifting. You wait here. I'll walk home. - Is it done, brother? - No, there's a few more. I've to submit these documents to the emigration in the morning. That's why. Please have your tea. Has Sulekha slept? I don't think so. He called her today. - What did she tell him? - Who knows! Let them decide what to do. We shouldn't interfere. Stop here. See you, brother. I've to get back to work. Okay, be careful. Where is she going? So this is where you camp. They are gone. Who will feed you now? Diana? Allah! What's this? Who's there? You? All your family gone. Then why you here? - That's not my family. - Then? I work for them. - Where are you from? - I'm from Azerbaijan. - Your name? - Jameela. How can you stay in a closed house? I'll manage, sir. Tomorrow I'll go and find a job. - What job? - I'm a housemaid, sir. Our home.. Can you work for our family? - Yes, of course. - Thank you. Then come with me. Sir, I'll take my bag and I'll come. Thank you. Please do come. Diana? Where is that devil? Let her go. Diana! Diana! Give the phone to mother. Mom! What is it, son? Don't eat sugar when Susheela is not around, okay? She is a liar, son. - When are you coming home? - Oh my! Dasthakeer is bringing Sulekha home. I'll call you later, mother. Papa is bringing mama back. Yay! Mama is back! - This isn't her. - Hello! This is Jameela. From now on, she will look after you and manage this house. Jameela, this is my family. This is Dilruba, Aseem and Rumi. Chandrettan is like a brother to me. And I don't like cats. Good night! All of you. So where is your mother? She is with her parents in Dubai. So what would you guys like to have for breakfast? Wait! Where is your passport? Show your face. My face is not good after an accident. Come here with me. - One minute, Chandretta. - You are pushing me! I managed to find a maid somehow. Do you want her gone? We will get into trouble. This isn't our country. What trouble? We will do a trial for two days. Then we can send her off. - Did you see her face? - Why should I see her face? The one who's supposed to show her face isn't doing it. Now stop making faces and close the gates. He wants to see her face at midnight. Aren't you too old for that? Will there be any trouble? 'Aiyo!' Why didn't the alarm ring? Oh sorry. Chandretta, it's time. - Thank you. - No problem, sir. Wait, let me help you. This is all a woman has to do at home. 'New brooms sweep clean.' Bye. Assalamu alaikum! 'Green' has something special from Karachi. - Looks like they chased him away. - Certainly. Come on, Habeeb bhai. - What's happening in your land? - All good, Chandran bhai. - What is in that bowl? - Special mutton 'haleesa' from Karachi. Not hormone- treated goat, it's organic. Organic mutton 'haleesa' from Karachi. It's home- cooked. Come and have some, all of you. What is it? - 'Assalamu alaikum, ' boss. - 'Wa alaikum assalam.' - What's this? - Mutton 'haleesa'. Take out the plates then. So this is the secret of his health. I'm going to lift the fridge myself. Now it's okay. Thank you. Allah! - Oh no, I can't take it anymore. - 'Aiyo!' Why is this place so crowded? He proved he is from an enemy country. - What happened? - What happened!? A bomb or a missile would have been better. I feel like hitting you! Please don't go. - Where did boss go? - Where? YOU! - Open, you fool. - Not able to stop, Chandretta. Please let me reach home. Was it this far? Please help me reach the loo. It feels so good! Hello, who are you? I'm Jameela, sir. Jameela? Sorry, sir. I thought I was alone at home that's why I wasn't wearing my veil. It's okay, you look good. Hey, mama calling. - Hello. - Hi. Where is your new maid? She left for the city to see someone. She'll be back soon. - Can she cook? - Yes, she cooks well. But she isn't as good as you. - How does she look? - We haven't see her yet. - Why not? - Full covered, 'purdah' with veil. But she has lovely eyes. Aseem, don't stare at her eyes, okay? This is the age you get hormones. No, I saw it by chance. Don't worry, mama. Papa doesn't look at her. You and your dear papa! I know you are a team. No, we are in your team. Oh yeah. Now take a bath and learn your lessons. Aseem, don't sleep on the toilet, okay? - I'll give you a tight slap. - Oh no! Alright, I'll call you later. - Okay. - Bye. Bye. (Prayer) You, no? I'm a Christian, sir. Christian? Then why you wearing this? It's for my security. Security is okay. You can wear normal dress at home if you want. Thank you very much, sir. Very good! Keep it up. Dasthu! Congrats! Superb! Jameela aunty said their country has no progress report. That's why she works in our kitchen. What is this? - Do you want to work in a kitchen too? - Hey no. If this is how it goes, you may have to. - Will you study? - Ah. This is what you always say. Just look at that hair! - Thank you. - Go and study something. Your pen. Alright. Yes, I want this. Papa? I'll call you back. - This one. - Okay. 252 'dirhams'? That means Rs 5000. You have anything less pricey? Sorry, sir. Sir, please! Then we will take this. Please keep it for us. I'll drop the kids and come back. Come, let's go. - Can I get a discount? - No, sir. No? Okay. The AC has frozen the cake. It's so cold inside. Why not reduce the AC? - Got the cake? - Yes. Won't you invite mama for my birthday? No, but you can invite her if you want. And she is welcome if she wants to come. Get in the car. Come on, Chandretta. She doesn't care about her kid's birthday. And yet they want her. And what did he say? He asked me to invite you. Will you come tomorrow? It's happening tomorrow, right? We will see it then. Now go to bed. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Come on. What is this? You bought entire Dubai or what? Every time you swipe my credit card my mobile beeps, Sulu. My dear Dasthu, I'm really tired. We went to so many shops... looking for good discounts and bought only what we needed. Got it? You are just... You need to cut down expenses, Sulu. - We can't go on like this. - Oh yeah? You should have married an extravagant woman. Oh, what makes you think you aren't? School fees, household expenses... You need to think about all these, Sulu. You can't go shopping like this. I told you two kids are enough. But then came a third surprise gift. Dasthu, what are you saying? Mind your words! It's a woman's duty. You weren't careful. We need more income when a new member joins us. - How cheap! - Cheap, huh? I pay for the credit card bills not your father or brothers. You want your credit card? Here, take it. My father and brothers are still alive. If I need anything, I'll ask them. You'll see. I know what your brothers are. What do you know? They started a business with the money saved for your wedding. Did they give it back after so many years? Come on, answer me. That's between my father and brothers. Why do you bother about it? That was your money. I mean, it should have come to me. You want dowry after all these years? You and the kids could have used that money. Expenses at home, in the shop, for kids... Can't you see how much I struggle to make ends meet? I can't do this, Sulu. Such careless spending drives me mad. What are you doing, Sulu? If I stay on... we will end up hating each other. - Mama? - Don't leave, Sulekha. - Forgive him. - No, mama. He is stressed about something else. Give me that bag. Mama, please! Where are you going? - Please, mama. - I'm going to my home. This is not my home. Chandretta, please drop me if you can. - No mama, please. - Or I'll take a taxi. Drop her home, Chandretta. She can come when she stops being vain. Mama, please don't go! Please listen to us. Stay with your father, children. I'll be back But I need a break. Please drop me, Chandretta. - Mama, please! - I'll come back. Mama, don't go. Are you dreaming? Mama is back. Oh, it's just Badru uncle. - Happy birthday, sweetie. - Thank you. - See you, kids. Bye - Bye.

I'm coming. You had a great party, huh? You are enjoying without your mama! - I'm happy for you. - But you didn't come. Where is your super maid? Jameela aunty? Jameela aunty? When did she become your aunty? Hi madam. Don't cook junk food for my children, okay? Madam, I only cook healthy food. You don't iron sir's clothes. Just give it to laundry. But madam sir said laundry is too expensive. - And I'm happy to do it for him. - Hello? Why do you wear so much make- up at home? Did you take my make- up box? Actually madam, I never wear make- up. I'm always like this. Maybe it's a manufacturing defect. You don't go to sir's room alone, okay? Don't worry, madam. Your husband is a good man. I know, okay. - You go do your work now. - All work is done, madam. Done already? Rumi dear, tell her to maintain our garden. Garden looks superb, mama. There are many flowers. Madam, when are you coming back? Kids are missing you so much, madam. (Song on radio) May I come in? Please come in. - Keep it there. - Goodnight, sir. Goodnight, Jameela. Hello, Dasthakeer speaking. Okay Jameela. Goodnight! Sorry, who's speaking? Stop teasing me, Dasthu. I think I've heard this voice before. Aren't you the roaring tigress who left her husband and kids? Am I right? Have you eaten? Oh yes. So many varieties of continental food. The menu is awesome. I didn't know the world had such women in it. Such a poor woman! No arguments, no complaints! - The kids are so happy, you know. - They aren't happy. Who told you? We had great fun on Rumi's birthday. I hope you saw the video. Dasthu... Let's end this here. What? What's left to end? It already ended when you left us. You were the one who ended it. Yet I called you so many times. You said, 'I need a break.' And you tried to avoid me. Now that you know we are doing well... that we don't really need you you suddenly start behaving. Now listen to me. You are staying there until I'm convinced you've changed. Where are the plates? Nobody messes with Dasthakeer! 'Play will continue..' I'm so tired cleaning! Is it ripe? Don't spit, carry on. When I leave after work... I'll buy one kilo. Good for you! In that case, you'll have to buy in bulk. Eat fast and keep polishing. Oh my goodness! (children reading) Hi mama, we are studying. Is your maid still there? It's better to keep a close watch on her. Why? She's so honest and sincere. Nobody knows much about her. - That's why. - What do you mean? If your papa needs help you should attend to him. No, nothing like that. I want you to be cautious, that's all. Stop it, mama. We all miss you so badly. Come back. We want you, mama. Just stop your ego war. Close it, Chandretta. Turn off the lights. Close the door. - Hurry up! - Yeah wait. All you can eat for 10 'dirhams'. Unlimited food for 10 'dirhams'? One, two, three.. Chandretta? - Tomorrow is Friday, right? - Yes. Let's take the kids out for dinner. We need to have fun sometimes. - Alright. - Come let's go. - Chandretta, attack! - Okay, the war has begun. Eat well, okay. Eat everything and eat well. - Over here. - Take full advantage. Here. Eat maximum, unlimited food. No compromise. Take some more. Toss in some more. Don't drink water, have juice instead. Two pieces fried chicken, please. Eat well. - Sir, your cheque. - Thank you. Papa, you want more? - No, you guys have. I'll be right back. - Okay, papa. - I think you gave me a wrong bill. - Let me check, sir. It says 40 'dirhams' per head but it should be 10 'dirhams'. No, sir. It's 40 'dirhams' per head. No, it's 10. I have proof. This is your poster, right? See 10 'dirhams' per head. 'Aiyo!' It was our anniversary offer, sir. It expired a few days ago. - Expired? - See it's notified with a star sign. - A star? - 'Only on 7th Tuesday.' So it's 40 'dirhams'? Yes, it's 40 per head. Keep this with you. Thank you, sir. - How was the food, sir? - Wonderful! Thank you. - Very cheap, we should come next week. - Have some more. Sir, do you need any help? No, you go and take rest. I'll rock this dish. 'I'm going to blast this.' - Yeah. - You go, take rest. "It's rest time It's the guest's test time" Where did sister go? Sister? You'll take use to milkmaid And take the chilies Mango curry, coconut curry... So many curries! Oh God, odds are it'll be a mess. No, I can do this. Coconut oil? Pour coconut oil first. My fish! What's this, Aseem? You need to hit this one. - Help! Help! - Help? Oh, I hope she didn't see me. Strike that one. Excuse me. Do you hear someone crying? - Who? - No. Yes, I can hear. Come, let's see. - My heart says someone needs our help. - Is that so? Come quickly. See, I told you I heard a voice inside my head. Come on, help her up. Are you hurt? - What happened? - Who did this to you? - Some damned guy pushed me down. - Praise be to God! - Take her to her home, son. - Hold her hand. - Who did this to her? - Not me. What happened? What is it? - What happened? - She's okay. We reached in time to save her. - Good! - Praise be to God! Thank you. - Thank you, good day! - Praise be to God! May peace be with you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Come, let's get away quickly. Can you feel that satisfaction and peace you get from helping others? - That's why I said... - Uncle? - Yes? - You people go. What are you waiting for? Go. What happened, son? - What happened? - I saw you hit my grandmother. But you don't worry I won't tell anyone. Because you're my future father- in- law, right? So you don't worry. 'Assalamu alaikum.' 'Wa alaikum assalam.' Yes! Did anybody see that? Thank God there's no CCTV. Isn't it time for Rumi to be home after tuition? Not yet but she'll be back soon. Juice. Come on. I'm so thirsty! Juice? Where's mine? - Chandretta, no! - Chandretta! Why does the juice smell fishy? Oh my God! Did you drink Rumi's fish? Don't worry, Chandretta. Fish is good for asthma. But papa... Rumi will make a fuss if she doesn't see her fish. Oh my God, what will I say to her? That's true. What did you do, Chandretta? Come on, let's catch some fish before she's back. - Will swallowing a fish kill? - No, fish don't die so easily. Come on! - Hey, stop the car. - Why? Go back. Back! Stop here. Everything on earth is there for a reason, Chandretta. Oh gosh! There comes Rumi! - Stop! - Don't stop, just go. - Papa! - Did she see us? - No, we didn't see her. Go fast. - Give it to me. - She is coming, be quick. Give me. Why didn't you stop the car when I waved at you? Waved at us! When? You think I won't stop the car for you? - Aren't you my sweetheart? - Do you think your uncle won't stop? Is the tuition over? Did you study well? Hey, look at that. - See the sky? - Yeah, it's a nice sky. - Come. - Yes! - You changed the water? - Yes. Chotti? Tintu? Tintu? Papa? My fish babies are all grown- up. They grow fast on changing the water. Because it's freshwater. Freshwater has a lot of oxygen. And it's low on carbon dioxide. If there's a lot of oxygen and somebody has asthma he will be easily cured. Am I right, Chandretta? Sir? Sir, I need to tell you something. Yes, tell me. I came to Dubai on 3- months visiting visa. It's okay, we can renew it. But my visa expired 9 months ago. Oh God! - You're staying here illegally? - Yes, sir. What is this, Jameela? What did you do! My cousin cheated me. I've so many problems back home. I can't go. Don't worry. Let me see what I can do. I feel very guilty for bothering you, sir. It's okay, no tension. I'm here. I feel so safe here. I like your children. You're a very good man. You gave me so much respect. Thank you very much, sir. God bless you, sir. Okay, no tension. Chandretta, it's not what you think it is. That poor girl has a pure heart. Don't you think I've a pure heart? Pure heart, my foot! Being pure or impure has nothing to do with this. No wonder you don't want Sulekha to come back. Even though she wanted to come. Dasthakeer... you're already part of a family circus. It's better to not add new items to it. Got it, Chandretta. I got it all. What? Don't play with petrol and fire. I won't repeat it. No problem. Hello. Yes, madam. Yes, madam, I'll come. It's Aseem's teacher. But I already paid the fees. God knows what he did this time. What will he do? You drop me at school and carry on. I'll come to the shop when I'm done. No concentration, no hard work. Computer science - 4 out of 20. English - 6 out of 20. And maths - 5 out of 20 He's a slow learner. You need to consult a psychology counsellor. I'll pay special attention, miss... Okay. Papa, wait. Papa! Papa! Wait, papa. Do you know how much money I spend on your studies? - Sorry, papa, I'll study well. - This is what you always say. I should break your headphone first. - Please, papa... - I'll see you at home. Oh no! Bye. Hello, Sulu Mini Mart. Order ready, madam. Right now. Why no one delivered this order yet? Where is everyone? Noushad and Sathar are out for delivery and we are busy. We shifted two days ago. Yeah, the house has all amenities. You called? And then? Okay. Here. I'll call you back. Hey! Dostoyevsky? Raji? It's been such a long time, come in. What's with your looks! Are you a delivery boy? No, I do all the work in my shop. - Come in. - Yeah. Let me take off my shoes. - Is this your home? - Of course. What's with your looks! Are you a delivery boy? Papa, food is ready. - How many are there? - Here. Your customers don't buy on credit, do they? But your supplier bills are overdue for months. You need to think hard before routing your money to other things. This is very inappropriate. You are the new guy, right? Keep this for now. I'll give the balance soon. This isn't enough, sir. Let's do one thing. We will supply new stock once you clear your dues. I'm taking this load back. Hey, be a little kind, brother. He isn't going anywhere. And we are his regular suppliers. Who the hell are you? It's people like you who destroy this market. Take your hands off me. - Did you get the count right? - Yes. - Put everything back. - What? I said put everything back in the van. Load it Okay, let's load everything back. We don't want anything from him. Come on, quick. Here, take this. - Such arrogance! - Tell me about it! I hope he makes a fortune like this! It's okay, Titu. All I've for you are these empty hands. These were the hands that first reached out to me when I started. I don't care if they are empty or full. Let me get your stock. - Take it away now. - Brother, please check. Check everything before unloading. Here you go. Sathar, be careful. It's glass, don't break it. I'm careful, Chandretta. - Close the door. - Okay. Hello! This is Udayettan. - Hello, Dostoyevsky. - Hello. - What's your name? - Shivani. We are on our way to Dubai. We used to meet up with old friends here. Like a family gathering. Now nobody has the time. I told them I found our long- lost Dasthakeer. They are very excited. So we meet on 12th, Thursday evening. I'll send the location. You should come with your family. What will you have, dear? - Chocolate, ice- cream? - No, uncle, thank you. - Okay, meet you then. - Okay. If Allah wills! I'll kill you if you come up with any excuse. Such a good chance to see your old friends. Won't you go? No, Chandretta. Old friends know only that old Dasthakeer. Dostoyevsky. I don't want to change that. Why are you standing here? - Come on, join us. - Yeah sure. Okay. - Am I right? - Yes. - Yeah right. - Shamshi? - Is it? - Yes. - Long live the revolution! - Long live the revolution! - Long live the revolution! - Long live the revolution! - Long live the revolution! - Long live the revolution! Long live the revolution! Look who's here. It's Dostoyevsky. - Hello, Dostoyevsky! - Hello, Dasthu! Welcome back. Hey, Dasthu? Don't you remember me? - I'm Shamsina. - Shamsina? Allah! Everybody is here. - I'm Alex, you remember me? - Of course, still a big man. - Dasthu! - Oh yes, Allah! "O darling, your body is shimmering gold" "O golden girl, embrace me, pinch me" I'd decided not to come. Yesterday I found our college magazine by chance. I flipped through it then I couldn't sleep. Our college days were great, right? It would have been such a huge loss if I hadn't come. Dasthu, come here. - Have a drink. - No. Can I have 4 glasses of juice for my kids? Okay, sir. You guys carry on. Just a little. - Did you settle the sound system bill? - Yeah, it's done. 'Assalamu alaikum wa rahmathullahi wa barakathuhu.' 'Wa alaikum assalam.' Don't you recognise me? No. I'm Sulu's cousin, Arman. - From Kannur? - Yes. What are you doing in this setup, brother? What setup? I didn't expect to see someone like you at a cocktail party. - You're Arman, right? - Yes. What are you doing here? I run this catering service. So this setup is acceptable for business, huh? - That's... - What? Go! Look at Dostoyevsky! That man used to say religion is poison. Can a man change so much? Looks like the party will go on till dawn. - Be careful while serving. - Okay. Hello everyone! So next up is Dasthakeer uncle's daughter Rumi performing a song for all of us. Please come on to the stage, Rumi. What it is? Thank you. Now my brother will sing a song. Oh God! No, I can't. - Go. - Come on, sing. - Please go man! - Will he ruin it? - No chance. I think he is going to sing a Mappilapaattu, 'Aamina thatha'. "Oh Goddess Annapurna" "The One with large eyes" "Oh Goddess Annapurna" "The One with large eyes" "Oh Goddess Annapurna" "The One with large eyes" "The One who witnesses all happenings in all worlds" "Oh Goddess Annapurna" "The One with large eyes" "The One who witnesses all happenings in all worlds" "Please bless me with Your divine glance" "Oh Goddess Annapurna" "The One who lives in the sacred 'garta- tira' (Kuzhikkarai)" "The One who is the form of 'Omkara'" "The One who is the remover of all difficulties" "O Primordial One, the consort of the serpent- adorned (Lord Shiva)" "O Primordial One, the consort of the serpent- adorned (Lord Shiva)" "The One who makes Lord Parameshwara the Lord of all worlds, shine" "Oh Goddess Annapurna" "The One with large eyes" "The One who witnesses all happenings in all worlds" No concentration, no hard work. I should break your headphone first. "The One who holds a gem- studded vessel" "filled with sweet rice pudding in Her left hand" "The One who holds a gem- studded vessel" "filled with sweet rice pudding in Her left hand" "And has a golden ladle in Her other hand" "The One who is adept in protecting 'Kayaja' (Kamadeva) and others" "The One who is adorned in gold ornaments and silk" "The One who is served by the lotus- seated (Lord Brahma) and other gods" "The One who is praised by great sages like Tumburu and Narada" "The One who bestows salvation beyond 'Dharma, artha and kama'" "The One who is dearest to Guruguha And shines like the 3 words, 'ta- tvam- asi'" "Oh Goddess Annapurna" "The One with large eyes" "The One who witnesses all happenings in all worlds" "Please bless me with Your divine glance" "Oh Goddess Annapurna" "The One with large eyes" "The One who witnesses all happenings in all worlds" Well done, dear. Get in. - Bye, Dasthu. - Bye. Okay? Dasthu? Yes? Sorry, Dasthu! When we saw you like this we thought you had changed. Hey, it's okay. - That's what everybody thinks. - Sorry, man. It's okay. - Alright then. - Okay. - God willing, we will meet soon. - Okay. - Brother, please wait. - Chandretta, let's go. Brother? Wait a second. - What does he want? - Can you give me a lift? I live in your neighbourhood. My car is getting serviced. If I wait for my team, I'll be late. Okay. Hey, wait. Come here. You can sit here. Allah! If you don't mind can I say something? What? We don't see each other much but I've been observing you. By the way you look... I thought you were a role model in the matter of faith. But today I realised that the kids aren't being raised in the right way. What do you mean? Most of our scholars don't support music. So it's my strong opinion that the song your son sang... today was highly un- Islamic. Children can make mistakes. But instead of correcting it you encouraged him. It isn't the right thing to do, brother. Chandretta, please drop him home. Okay, Arman. You didn't give an answer, brother. I pointed out a fundamental mistake. Please step out, Arman. - Have a cup of black tea. - No, it's okay. Come on, Arman. Have a seat, Arman. - Arman? - Yes, brother. You totally misjudged me by the way I look. Earlier... some of my old friends also misunderstood me. But in a different way. What misunderstanding? It's good, isn't it? You wait here, Arman. I'll be back soon. - Oh no, Papa! - Papa? Wow, Papa! In the name of Allah! How is it? Okay? I used to be an unruly young man. I was at my peak when I got knocked out. My life was falling apart. So I began dressing up like this to regain my confidence. Then life gave me so many miseries that I stopped caring about my looks. I'm just an ordinary man with hundreds of problems. With every problem I get closer to Him. Now, he is in my heart. So the way I look has nothing to do with my faith. And others don't have to judge me by it. You live as you wish, Arman. And let others live as they wish. We need just a little kindness and a little respect for other's beliefs. That's it and the world will be a better place. Then why are you so worried, Arman? Chandretta? Arman is getting late. Please take him home. Go. Get out! Papa? The problem is that we think what we believe in is the only truth. There is only one universal flow. You need to get connected to it in some way. Everything else is politics. Do you understand? That's all. Why are your shoes here? It should be kept outside. Take it out now. In the name of Allah... - Shall I cut it now? - Sure. Bear the Almighty God in mind. Oh God! - Shukoor? - Yes? If the food is ready, we can eat. 'Wa alaikum assalam', ustad. I've been in Dubai for a few days now. But you didn't come this way, Dasthakeer. That's because I don't come that way, ustad. I sent you a few 'salams'* on WhatsApp. (greetings) And I saw blue tick on all of them. Yet you didn't send me a reply. I've been busy, ustad. Praise be to God, that's good news. It means your business is flourishing. It's not really great, ustad. Then we should make it great. Listen to me. We can do a special prayer. - What do you say? - Okay, ustad. I'll have lunch from your home after the prayer. It's been a while since I savoured Sulekha's cooking. Alright, shall I hang up, son? Okay, ustad. Okay. Sulu! These aren't our items, Dasthakeer. They are all newcomers. This is the only one I know. Just for a change. I see some changes in your looks also. Where is your beard? Is your faith intact? My faith is in here, ustad. Where's Sulekha? I want to see if she has changed too. Sulekha is with her parents. So you made these? That's great! No, we have a maid. Housemaid. Call her. I'll teach her to make Ponnani sardine curry with gooseberry puree. Call her. Hey, call her. Come on. Jameela? Please come. Hi, sir. Okay, ustad. - So Sulekha is living with her parents? - Yes. Then I didn't feel her absence here. In fact, he is having a wonderful time. But why should I tell you about it? You pocketed the money saved for your sister's marriage. You cheated your father, you crook. Shall we go then? Don't stare like a buffoon. Go and get the car. He has been ignoring Sulekha since that maid came. He even changed his looks. I heard she is staying here without a visa. I know a CID. We should inform the authorities when we see something illegal. It's our duty, Badru. - We have to teach him a lesson. - That's what I'm talking about. Look at that smile! Why are you here? Not going home? - Do you want some ice- cream or biscuits? - No, thanks. Then what's your problem? My mark- sheet, papa. Allah! 82 out of 100? 84! Really? Do I deserve a hug? There! 'Assalamu alaikum.' I'm from CID. - Yes, sir? - How many people staying in this house? - Myself and my 3 children. - And? And my driver. That's all. No one else? - No, sir. - Are you sure? - Yes, sir. - Come on, man. - Get me a cup of water. - Sure, sir. Please come. Where is your children and... They are in school. Driver went out. God has willed, nice villa! Can I look? - If you don't mind? - No problem, sir, please. Bathroom! Nice? My bedroom. - Nice! - Here... sleeping. Children's room. Kitchen. Listen... You'll be in big trouble if you are going to keep an illegal immigrant here. Okay? Okay Jameela? Are you making fool of me? ******, there's no woman. Rascals! - What the heck is this? - She was there. Allah! Go and complaint about it now. - Don't dare come before me again. - No. Get lost! Is there a stone around? His damn CID! Hold this. - Just hold it properly, man. - I'm holding it. There are so many in here. - Here, take it. - I've to do it all by myself. All you do is eat plum. - Good morning, brother. - Why are you here? We can't fight all the time. After all, it's business. Chandretta? Who allowed him in here? - I don't know. - We don't need his stock. - Brother, I don't need money now. - Money? I don't want to deal with you anymore. Take everything back now. - Okay. - His money! You have no work? Are you mad, *****? Go and work. These guys are driving me mad. Where's the money? Habeeb, go and work. - I'm working, right? - Watching cricket! Chandretta? Chandretta? - Chandretta? - Dasthakeer? What happened? What... What happened? Shall I call an ambulance? Get up. You didn't say anything, doctor. - Didn't they tell you anything? - Who? That big hospital in Dubai where you went for better treatment. Well, I don't lie to doctors. I thought I'd really die this time. That's why. When you realised their medicines and check- up... won't fit in your insurance card limit... you came here to die, right? You need medical help when you are ill. But how will I treat an imaginary illness? First try to control your mind. Do you follow? I'll never be weak, doctor. If I go weak, my kids will be left alone. Correct. When my battery is really low I'll come to see you, doctor. You can give me a shock treatment. Then I'll be fully charged God willing! - Okay. - That's it. Thank you, doctor. Bye! Aren't you coming? Here's your pyramid. - Okay, doctor. - Okay. Dasthu, please try to understand. No, Suraj, it's not okay. - That's why... - Dasthu, we aren't asking you. If one of us is in a difficult situation the others need to help. That's what friendship is about. We have come up with a solution. We will start a chit fund for 10 months. 10,000 'dirhams' per month. You can take the first lot. After that we can draw lots each month. But you have to pay off every month, okay. Suraj, give it to me. Here is the money from the first lot. This can solve your problems for now. - Take it. - No... Take it! Here. Some friends 'like' your posts on Facebook and send inspiring forwards on WhatsApp. If you ask them for a small help... you'll know what they really are. This was unexpected. You helped me at a crucial time. I'll never forget it. I'm going the first sitting in the car Okay, boss Chandretta, I'll drive. Keys? Take the bag. Get in. - Are you driving, papa? - Yes. Almighty Allah, please save us from all harm and danger! It's the first time I'm driving after the accident. Don't worry, you'll be fine. So can I go home peacefully now? The kids' vacation starts next week, right? You can go, Chandretta. Don't you need your salary? Yes or no? I know I delayed your visit so far. But don't get too nostalgic and settle down at home. Come back soon, there's so much work here. Where will I go leaving you here? I can't stay there for too long. I'm meant to be with you. Here's your salary. Now don't work too hard to convince me. - Nope. - Your full salary. - What's this? - For fruits. No tricks with me! Send some money home, alright? Smile now. Happy? - Thank you, boss. - Thank you, sir. Okay. Titu? How much do I need to pay? Let's clear all the dues. - We will start a new account. - Did you win a lottery? Take it, my son. You can't defeat this warrior! Here, count the money. Don't tell I gave you more. Where is it? Here? Dasthu - Unload the new stock. - Okay. - What happened to him? - I feel so relaxed now. Stop admiring the money. Come and do your job. Do you want me to hire extra hands? Allah! Who's this? Chandrettan looks glam! Looking handsome without a beard. - Will Susheela recognise you? - I doubt. It's been four years since we met. Habeeb, drop him off at the airport. Okay, sir. Don't hang about, come back soon. You know what happens here when you are gone. Keep this with you. See you soon! - Don't be sad, come back soon. - Yes, I'll. Sathar, Noushad... I'm going home. - See you, Chandretta. - Bye, Chandretta. - Did you take your passport? - Oh yes. Goodbye. Jameela? Hello, Jameela? - Hello, sir. - Where are you? How many times I called you? Sir, I'm in trouble. What? Jameela? Sorry! I can't do this, Ivan. You can't force me. This is an opportunity. You know that. Jameela, is there any problem? Who is this man? Please give me some time, Ivan. I'll meet you here after an hour. Please! Sir, come with me. He's my cousin's friend, sir. He's trying to exploit my situation by offering me a dirty job. A job of money and luxury. But a dirty job. I don't want that, sir. I thought of you today. And I feel so secure at your home. I felt just like my family. I don't know if right or wrong. But can I ask you a question? Yes. Is there any chance I can stay with you again? With your family? I mean, legally. Legally? How? I mean... Can you marry me? - Jameela! - I don't want anything, sir. But a safe place, a shelter. It'll only be on the papers. I'll be living with you as the same housemaid. I won't disturb your family life. Sir, I'm sorry. I just asked. Forget it! Sorry, Jameela! Sorry Down, down! Come with me. Dilruba, this is nice. You learned how to cook? No other way, so we just managed. We missed you, Jameela aunty. It's so windy. - Eat! - It's okay, don't worry.
