Depart to the first station. I've reached the junction. What the hell is going on? Shit! The car behind is destroyed. It's done! What shall we do? It's done, boss! Open the door and get down! Did you hear me? - Are you getting out or not? - I can't. Get out! Get out or I'll shoot! Boss! Reverse the car! Give us the diamonds if you want to live! You heard me? - Just give it to them! - Just give it to them! Thank you. Hey, Fei. - Why are you so late? - Yes, I am a little late. Your favorite table is reserved for you. Please follow me! Please have a seat. I prefer a different table. Okay, please come over here. What would you like to have, Sir? What would you like to have? - My usual. - Yes, it will be ready at once. Fei! Don't break the ashtray and hurt your hand. I am just exercising my wrist. Just be frank. I don't really have the time. What a joke! Mind your manners! Be respectful to him. Hey. Are you crazy? Is this the way you talk to Fei? Please forgive these young men, Fei! Just tell me what you want! I'll leave if there's nothing else. Fei! I have 50 million worth of diamonds. I want to sell them. I can count you in for this. Is this the case where three people are dead and four are injured? It was such a huge case! I can't handle it. I'll pass. It's not that you can't handle it. You don't have the guts! Who do you think you are? - You have no right to speak here! - You... - What? - Hey! Hey, sit down! Fei, we're here for money, not fights. I'll receive one-tenth of the total. According to the underworld's rules, I should've received 30 percent. It's a big offer! Think about it! Give me a call once you decide. Let's go! Table for one, sir? Is Mandy working here? Oh, Mandy is over there! Let's eat dinner after work. What a mess! Why did you leave just like that? I know it's my fault for disappearing so long. But, do you know I've been searching all... Don't treat me like this. I'm in front of you now. Andy, can you take his order please? I'm very busy. Do me a favor and get it yourself. Actually, I... Listen to me, please! Let me help you. Please let me explain. It's the judge's fault for imposing such heavy penalty. I'm not guilty. I've found a lawyer. Let me do it. - Who ordered this black drink? - Here, please! - And the red one? - It's for him! - I know, this is a D52. - Over here. Hot stuff, pal! Be careful! Just joking, sorry! Don't go, listen to me! Please believe me one last time. Put your trust in me again. I can give up anything in this world, but I can't live without you. I swear all the things I've done have its purpose. You'll understand later. Later! Do I have to wait until 1997? No. 1996 will do. Just once more. The last time. One last time. - Table for two? - No, we are looking for someone. Help yourselves. There he is. The one at the bar. - Take him out. - Yes. What do you think? Why do the cops follow you wherever you go? You are Cockroach, aren't you? You can't call me that! My name is Cheung Lon! Who are you? I'm a cop! Come with me! It's all right! Why should I follow you? Are you gay? - You aren't coming with me, are you? - No! What can you do to me? Hey! You are under arrest! Mandy! Let's go! Wait for me! Move! Why didn't you return my calls? You spoiled my plan! - Don't pretend! I tell you... - Let me go! What are you doing? I let you off because of Inspector Lee. Bullshit! Inspector Ng is your new boss. I'll be transferred soon. Are you kidding me? Let's transfer together. I won't trust anyone except you. You really think you're a cop? Are you nuts? You're only an undercover cop! You're only good at becoming a gangster! Are you crazy? Why are you shouting? You want him killed? Cockroach, don't fool around. I've done a lot to get you in. Don't waste all my effort, please? Sir, I'm not fooling around. I'll resign if I don't get to be in the police force. Did you resign then? All these years, you are just an undercover cop. You'll need to notify your resignation three months in advance as a cop. The headquarters don't even have my file. Who should I notify when I resign? The hell for notifying! Lon, I understand your situation. I'll transfer you back later. Before the transfer, you'll need to work with Inspector Ng. Did you hear me? Your wish is my command! Inspector Ng? You should learn communication skills from Inspector Lee. Stop your bullshit! I am counting on you. Don't fool me. Don't you trust me? I do. Recently, a large amount of diamonds went missing. I need information. Don't run away this time. Keep in touch! - Looking for Mandy? - Yes! She's gone. - Miss! - What is it? Nothing. Where are the diamonds? Allow me. Aren't these diamonds from that case? It's hard to sell them. Don't waste my time! Do you want it or not? Yes, why not? Please give me a figure! Good! As usual, you have to pay one-third of the market price. In cash. No problem! How about you? It's fair. Deal! Tony, it's a deal, bring me the money. You bastard! We brought the goods but you came empty-handed? Hey, what are you doing? Watch what you are doing! As long as I'm here, you have no right to speak! Who knows if that bastard is messing with us? Why didn't you do as I said? I told you to do the exchange at the same time! Tony, they said we are messing around. Are you brainless? Only idiots would make this deal alone. What? You don't believe me? Let's see who's stronger! We are here for business, not fights. Just take the goods and give him the money! I want to receive the goods first. Okay! Yes, we should just do it this way! Give him the money! Let's go! Frog! What? Don't move! Or I'll blast his head off! Please don't! Hey, calm down! Calm down! Hey, don't shoot! Don't get me into trouble! Don't hurt him! I can give you my share. You don't want me to kill him? Give me the diamonds then! I'll give it back! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! - Get me my money! - Give it to me! Give it to me! Hey, don't shoot! Fei! I want you dead! Bastard! I'll search Hong Kong inside out and hunt you down! Let's go! SHIPPING SERVICE COMPANY Seven-up! - Fei, please have a seat! - Thank you. How is it going? Everything is ready. The ship will leave at 7 p.m. tonight. Here's 20,000 dollars. Where can I board? Sorry, it should be 25,000 dollars. What? Are you really trying to help me? I've helped you before! I'm helping you now in return. If you want to leave immediately, I've already found you a ship. I am not lying to you. Okay, don't fool me! Tell me, what time can I board? It's 7 p.m. tonight at Yellowstone Pier. I wish you good luck, you can leave now. Have you ever seen this man? No! Inspector Ng, nothing at Saigon Main Street. Yes, I am coming from Sargon Front Street. Don't move! Don't go! Spread out! Over there! Where is he? He can't be that fast! Stupid! He won't just stand still waiting for you! - Let's go! - Hello, sirs! - Are you looking for me? - Calling Inspector Ng! - Don't move! Hands up! Hands up! - Target is arrested. - My position is at Saigon Side Street. - Sir... - I'll come immediately! - Please be careful with your guns. Don't move! Hands up! - Go over there! Don't move! - So many people! Speak up! Or my partner will be angry. Are you threatening me? Why don't you just beat me up? Such a big mouth! Let me teach you a lesson. Inspector Lee! Why are you so impolite to Fei? Lee, you're finally here! Are they your subordinates? What kind of cops are they? They are just newcomers. Are you trying to get information from Fei through violence? Years ago, a cop treated him the same way and got his ribs broken. Don't go too far. My temper is better now. Take a seat! Fei, how did you get into such a big trouble? I am in such bad luck that everything just went bad. I seldom go to Saigon for seafood. Once I'm done, I was arrested by your men. What a coincidence. There are no waves without wind. I am not involved in this case, Lee. Can you help me out? Yes, but I need your co-operation. We can't help you if you won't say anything. Forget I asked. No problem. I know it's hard for you. But it doesn't matter. We are two different people with different principles. We cannot force one to agree to another. But, I will not betray my friends. I cannot survive if I do so. I've got no choice then. I know you won't say a word. You two, debrief Fei. Be polite. There is no use in scaring him. Am I right, Fei? Are you leaving, Lee? - Yes, enjoy yourself. - When are you free to go for a drink? Sure, if you are free from any charge! Okay! Take a seat. We'll arrest him. You get close to him. I want to know who did the diamond robbery. I just got out of prison. Now, you want to put me in jail again? Are you crazy? It's an order. I am not asking for your opinion. Just in case you have forgotten, I am a cop not your prisoner. You... You're giving me all the difficult tasks. Why don't you do it? I can do it if you don't. Let me think about it! Watch, necklace, wallet! Have you taken all your stuff? Senior, this is Lai Chi Kwok! Good, they're in for the same reason. Take out all your belongings! Fei, why are you here? We met before at Kin's dinner. Your nephew said a lot of bullshit there. Good morning! I'm Cheung Lon, not Cockroach. Nice to meet you! I don't know you. What are you charged? Shut up! It's lucky to be imprisoned with you. Stay away before I lose my temper! Why are you so angry? - Let's go! - Move it! I know how to walk! You can climb if you like. - Can I fly? - Go! Ten... I've known him for ten years. But he betrayed me! If I go out, I would kill him. What is your opinion? Am I right? Shut up! Can you tell him to leave me alone? Hey, would you keep quiet? Okay! Push them off the road. - What's the matter? - Don't stop the car! We'll die if you stop! Hurry up! - Who are they? Are they looking for you? - The prison car is under attack! From behind! Report your position immediately. We are at Wai Yip Street, Kwun Tong. Do you copy, over? Calling Control, do you copy? Lay down! - Are you all right? - My hand! I moved back quickly. I'm not hurt. - Move the car! - Yes! Man, are you all right? Hey, watch it! Go ahead and have a look! Fei, you are not hurt! Great! Lucky! My nose just bleeds! - Fei. - Get lost! Your nose didn't even bleed! You're great! Don't disturb me in picking the key! The police are coming! We are safe. Let's find a way to climb up. Climb up? We need to escape! We'll be in big trouble if we escape! It'll be a bigger trouble if we stay. I want to stay but we are locked together. Chop away the hand! Which one, yours or mine? Shut up! We've walked a long way! What for? Say what you want. We're in the same boat. I'm telling you, I don't know you. I won't ride in the same boat with you. I want you to disappear once the handcuff is off. Be tolerant, Fei! I am forced to stay with you too! Let's go! Yes. Fei! I regret to inform you, but the ship has already sailed. No bullshit! When is the next one? At 12 midnight. But the money you've paid is just enough for deposit. We're charging 50,000 dollars each now. Wow, it's like taking money from a beggar. You're just bullying the weak. What are you talking about, young one! We're all working for money. I'm not your relative or friend. That's right. So give me back my money. - Don't move! - Hey! Fei, don't fool around! Fool around? Are you sure you can beat Fei, young one? Hey, you! Get them out! Get out bastard! Someone's making trouble! Help! Someone's making trouble! Help! Don't shout! Don't shout! Someone's making trouble! Beat him! Jump! Fei, your era has gone! You can't beat me! Did you hear that, Fei? He's just talking big! Let's go! Hey! What is it? He disappeared. We have no information. Disappeared? He can't stay hidden. Tell our men to look after all his relative firms. He'll go to his gangs. - Okay. - Let's go. Fei. Tony is paying a hundred thousand to have you dead. But don't worry. No one knows where you are as long as you're here. Fei, I envy you. You have such a reliable friend. Of course! All our affairs are led by Guan Yu's principles. - Yes! - Now you're in trouble. We, as followers, must help you by all means. Please find me some new clothes to change. Sure, no problem! Fei, in this kind of situation I don't think you should escape elsewhere. Shut up! We still have things to settle. If it's not for me, you'd now be cut into pieces. It's your fault I missed my ship. How can this be my fault? I just didn't want you to be taken advantage of. Let me wipe your mouth. I'll count to three and if you're still here, I'll chop you into pieces. One. You can't order me to go! Don't think that I am afraid of you. Everyone needs respect! Two. Okay. I'll go! Three. Hey! Socket! Hey, coming! They'll leave any time! Come now! Socket, are you ready? Coming! Inspector Ng speaking! Who is it? This is Lon! Where have all of you been? Nobody is watching over me. Fei and I almost died! Listen! The bullets found in the prison car are the same in the gang fight. We're sure that Fei is involved. Great! He is now in a garage at Kwun Tong. Arrest him at once! I don't need instructions from you! I won't arrest him now. Continue staying with him and find out who is his partner. Hey, what are you talking about? I've just run away from him. Now you want me to go back! No kidding! It's your own business. Contact me if you have any news. Hello. Hello. You bastard, coward... One word from you and I work like a dog. Now, you even hang up on me! I hate it when someone hangs up on me! You don't respect me, I won't obey you! You're so generous. You won't blame me, right? No, of course! You are a hero, I... He is inside. - Hey! - Don't move! Hung! I won't pay you any less! Don't move! Let's talk about this. Talk? What is there to talk about? You killed my boss. I didn't do that. It's Guts who framed me. Now he even wants to kill me. I don't care. You are the middleman. You are responsible. Unless you give me both the diamonds and Guts. Just kill me, would you? Where can I find these things for you? Okay, I'll kill you then! Kill him! Socket! None of my business! I'm just a bystander! Tell them to stop! Hurry up! - Fei! - Stop! Stand aside. Go over there! Go aside, damn it! - Go in, go inside! Go! - Listen to him! Stand back! Run! Quick! Hold the door! Can this work? No! Run! Hurry up! Ride the MTR if you want to be quick. Working hours are over. Fei! - Where's Master? - He's performing the lion dance. What is going on? Enough! Stop the drum! Kin! Hold it! Kin! Oh, Fei! What's the matter? I need to talk to you. All of you, practice outside! Yes, Master! How did you get into this big of a trouble? Who is he? Oh, he is... Kin, right? Hi! Call me Lon, Fei's friend. Kin, do me a favor. Give me a few thousands to escape! Fei! The group's finance is really tight nowadays. If everyone takes money from the group, no one dares to be the accountant. You shouldn't say so, Mr. Kin. I have worked for the group for more than ten years. Now I only want some money in return. And you're refusing me now? Sorry, I can't help you. Is that how you treat the members of your group? No compassion? How about this... Someone had asked me to collect a debt from a factory. You can earn a few thousand by helping me. Don't say I didn't help you. No one talks about loyalty now. If I were you, I'd call police to arrest Guts. Are you out of your mind? I'm already in deep shit now. And you want me to betray my friends? - Just once, no harm. - Oh, you... Let's go! Stop, you bastard! - Stop! - What is it? Don't run, Fei! This way! - Go the opposite way! - Yes! This way! Jump! - You wait for him! - Okay! Get over there! - Gun! - Run! Is this the way, Fei? No, that way! What is going on? I want him alive. Get away! Are you crazy? There's a back door. Is this the end for us? It's locked. Let's go! Which way should I go this time? Up the roof. Trying to fool me? It's locked! Break it down! Don't move! Police are heading up. Let's go! Don't run! Move aside! Run! - I don't want to die. - Jump! Come! - I'll get them! - Brother... The cops are coming. Don't go after them. - Go! - Go! Go inside! We were being chased since last night. Don't follow me, kid. You may be dead for no reason. You don't have to get the beating from them. You can ask for your gang to fight back. My gang? All I have is a zoo. They won't help me in a situation like this. Don't ever expect them for help. - Let's go! - I want to discuss something with you. If you don't mind, I can join your gang. At least you have someone to help you. You're nuts. Now, a lot of gang leaders are going to the government to remove their triad identity. And you want to join the triad. Are you crazy? Let's move! There's a brain drain in the triad society, hence the need for a new generation in triads. The triads nowadays are tricky. They don't talk about brotherhood anymore. Don't ever think about it. They are coming! Gentlemen, are you interested in joining the police force? Good remuneration and fringe benefits, think about it. Fei, if you are not considering me, I'll join the police force. It's good to be a policeman. But sir, he has to inform his brother first. Go back and tell your brother. - They're back. - Keep an eye on them! A super hiding place! You call this a super hiding place? It is. I hid here with a girl before. No one will ever know. Let's head up and have a look. Call inspector Ng! Panda, the target appeared, can you hear me? Is it all right? It's like a Tiananmen Square. It's even more grand. I'll go to the toilet. There's beer in the fridge, help yourself. I WANT LOVE I REGRET LOVING YOU THERE'S A LIMIT TO PATIENCE THEY WON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE BECAUSE I'VE TAKEN THE GOLDFISH AWAY Stop looking. All the fishes were taken away by my girl. Girls have good memories. They remember whatever they bought. But they never think who paid to feed the fishes. Women are like that. They are really mean once they are mad at you. Just like my wife, she... What about your wife? - Nothing. - Hey. Tell me a little. We are friends. Tell me. I said it's nothing, busybody! Let me learn something out of it. Tell me. What are you doing? It's none of your business. It's my private affair. I've never seen anybody as busybody as you are. Where should I sleep tonight? Any of the two rooms. I need to sleep. Good night, Fei, I'm sorry. You son of a bitch. Hey... Mandy, please! She's busy. Who's calling, please? I'm Cheung, may I speak to her? I told you she's busy. Can you call later, please? Who are you? I'm her man. I'm her husband. Stay out of my way. Her husband? Cousin, who called just now? He called the wrong number. Mandy. Cousin. I've thought about it. I don't want to go to Canada. You... Aren't we getting married? I don't feel too good about this. Don't be silly. Everyone does this. We fake our marriage in Hong Kong. Then live in Canada for three years. We can divorce once you get a green card. Many of our relatives did this. Mandy, I'm talking to you. Mom, don't. Mom, don't go away! What are you doing? - Daddy... - Shut up! My wife! I have given you the last chance. But you've never changed. You'll never see both of us again. Daddy... Mom, I don't want to go. You're different now. You are not the same old Fei anymore. I need a responsible and ambitious man who can give me security. What is it? Mandy! What happened to you? What happened to her? Don't ask. Bring her over there first. She fainted? Mandy! What happened to her? Don't ask. Bring her to consciousness first. Such trouble! Lady, I beg your pardon. How are you? You're finally awake... - Who are you? - Calm down! Go away, don't come near me! - Calm down. - Go away! - Mandy! - Calm down. - Fei is our friend. - Tell him to get away from me. Miss, I thought you were... - Get lost! - All right. I'll go. Hurry up and leave. You'll get throat cancer for yelling so loud. Call me when you're coming next time, so there won't be any misunderstanding. Don't worry, I came to pack my belongings. I won't be coming back anymore. What's wrong with you again? Take it back! Can you let me explain? All right, tell me. If your reasons are justified, I'll move back immediately. I can't tell you now! It's a waste of time speaking with you. Don't be angry, I'll buy you ice cream. Cheung, let me tell you. I have decided to move to Canada. Have you asked for my opinion? Mandy. All right, I'll give you one last chance. If you don't tell me now, I'll be gone forever. Do you know that you've completely changed? You are not the same old Cheung. I need a responsible and ambitious man who can give me security. But look at you. You have lost yourself. Please don't go. Don't blame me. Don't blame me. You killed all my hopes. You made me leave you. Mandy. My wife. - Please don't go. - Please don't go. I'm just learning Mandarin. Sorry! Sorry! Do you think I'll date you? No way, Fei! You are cold-blooded. You are so ugly. They have left in a car! Wait a moment, Bill. What is it? Damn it! Where's my gun? Are you kidding me? - Why are you so serious? - Give it back. Give it back! - Come on. - Stay there! Give it back! I'll beat you to death if I catch you. Fei, are we out collecting money? Are you coming? I'll follow you. I'll get a taxi first. Here comes one. Are you Fei? Yes. I'm Lon. Go. Fei, you... Pay us back! We're mad! Can you see it? Please calm down! Money is on its way from the bank. Please be patient. I'm responsible for seizing the money. Just kill anybody who comes in your way. You heard it? Looks like you are being betrayed again. Are we here to collect the debts or to rob? Is there any difference? Don't complain if you want money. It's not like this. The way to get money should also be considered, right? Yes, we should have principle. We can get money in other ways. Since we are not on the same track, I won't be in your way, let's go. Excuse me! - What's the matter? - Don't move. Move! Go out. PAY US BACK! Don't move. Hands up. Be careful, Sir. - What are you doing? - No, just covering the chewing gum. Nobody can leave here before this is settled. Do you know how to use a gun? The security button is still on. Fei! Fei, help me. Didn't you say you want to be a leader? Learn how to fight. You were saying three sets of kung fu? I have only one. Hey, wait for me. Why did you pick up the gun? It's better to have a gun with me. Don't worry, the money is here. Look, we've got the money. Please calm down. PAY US BACK OR WE WILL REPORT TO THE POLICE! How are you? It's been five years. I am not the same Taiwanese lady anymore. Is he your biological brother or is he one of the gang? You just have a throat operation. Don't talk too much. Oh, just a friend! Come in! Come in! Take a seat. Thanks! Your husband treating you well? Quite good! Anything I can help? Oh yes! What is it? I... We can still be friends even after our divorce. But my husband will be back soon. I don't want him to... Okay, I understand! Sorry, we are leaving now! Go! Fei, wait a minute! Come here! I didn't mean that! I know. Do you need money? How much do you need? A hundred thousand. A hundred thousand? Wait a minute! She's living fine now! She's married to a doctor, have a stable life. Her life will be much worse with me. - It's better than to stay with me! - Mom, I'm back! You, you are... Yes, I'm your... Look at our child! Lucky that she resembles her mother! Are you always that busy? Yes. No! Winnie! Say hello to uncle! Uncle! Good girl! I've only got fifty thousand in my bank account. If it's not enough, I have a watch here. - You can take it with you. - It's okay! I can find some other way! Thank you! Welcome! I have to go now. See you soon. Let's go! Hurry up! They are your wife and daughter! Why are you so afraid? All my life, I've never done anything wrong to others. But I always felt that I owed them a lot. It's not your fault. Are you crazy! It's my fault! Who else can I blame? Sorry. I can't get your share. We are supposed to board the ship together. That's okay! I can get my own money! I'll go meet a friend! See you at the hiding home. Lon. Midnight tomorrow at Western District Pier. I know! You've disappeared all day for no reason. Where have you and Lee been actually? Finding ways to escape! I think he is innocent. Why don't we just arrest him? Innocent? Then why does Guts want him so bad? He was framed. Why are you against him? - Why do you care about him? - Care? Do I have the right to care for others? I just don't want to waste my time. Don't worry about that. Just obey the orders! When and where? Midnight tomorrow at Western District Pier. Right, Bill and James! - Yes! - Yes! Get some people and spread the news! If Guts know, he will appear. You, stay with him! If you do so, we will die! Are you afraid? Find ways to escape if you are afraid! I'll beat you up one day! You are back! Try my cooking! Take a seat. Good food! Eat! If you don't eat, when you are on the ship, - you won't have any food. - I lost my appetite. Is there a problem with the money? No, my friend promised to help. That's great. We'll go to Thailand, then try to go to South America. After that, we can run a large nightclub with our friends. Then we can enjoy life. Be a millionaire in South America. Come on! Cheers! Will I trouble you if I follow you? Don't say so! You've said that you want to be with me. I'm not forcing you to join me. We can still be friends even if we're not gangsters. I always spoil everything. - I'm afraid later... - Silly guy! As long as you do not have the intention to hurt me. I know you have things you can't let go off. Find a way to talk to her and she'll be all right. I'll help you settle everything with Mandy after this meal. Ring the bell! What's the matter with you? Ring the bell! Listen! Once we are inside, whatever she says just admit it's your fault and apologize. I'll wait for you here! Ring the bell! I can't! What are you doing? No way! She won't let me in! I scolded her last time. Now that I came back... She won't let me in! Which floor is she in? Second floor! This is it! Mandy. You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen. Why don't you marry me for real? Would you be serious at least for once? Okay, I will let you step on me this time. - That's very kind of you. - Don't bullshit! Let's go! - Then I step on you now! - Come on! Mandy, will you marry me? I really love you! No kidding! Mandy. Marry me! Our wedding is in two days. Really? That's great! What are you doing? Hold on! Wait a moment! You're a really brave robber! Are you crazy? Go down! I'm not a robber! - Don't wait! You do have guts! - I'm not a robber! - Don't come over! Tell the guard. - Mandy! - Go down! Hurry up! - I'm not a robber! He is Cheung Lon! Come here, hurry up! Are you trying to kill him? Hold it! What do you want? Don't be afraid, I'm here. What a mess! I'm asking you now, are you really going to marry this guy? It's none of your business! I'll ask you one more time! Are you going to marry him? Don't bother him! Call the police! - Call the police? I'll beat you up! - Calm down! Don't come over! No police! It's between the both of them! Trying to scare us? Come with me! I won't follow you! - We're done! - Don't talk! Just listen to me! I'll tell you all my secrets! Come out! - Leave me alone! - What are you doing? What did you do? - What's the matter? - Bastard, trying to pick a fight? Lon, are you all right? How dare he hit me? You hit him? Yes! So what? Cousin? Cousin? Are you all right? Okay! Just feel dizzy! Get lost! Get lost! Two of you! You want me to go? How about him? I was also hit! Go away please! I call the police if you don't go! - Okay! Call the police! - Lon, calm down! - Let's leave! - You can call the police! But I won't go! Where is the telephone? Are you crazy? The cops are looking for you! Let's go! I never think you'll treat me this way! - Go! - Okay. No police! Strip the skin! FINANCE COMPANY - Who is it? - Ricky! I was told that Fei will escape by boat!

Shut up! Don't move! Lon! Hey! The diamonds are here. Get it! I'm going to throw it! Lon! Are you all right? There are exits under the holes. Go! Fei. Lon, what a waste you're not a gangster! - Inspector Lee! - Inspector Lee! - Where is Lon? - Inside with the gang! Why are we not taking any action? It's not the right time yet. Inspector Lee, that's Lon! Don't fire. - Freeze! - Give me the gun. Don't move! - Are you all right? - Still alive! Where's Fei? He has escaped with the diamonds. You helped him! I'm suing you for perverting the course of justice. All your words - will be used as evidence in court! - Fuck off! - You hit me? - Yes. So what? - Lon! - You... - Forget it. - You saw that! He hit me! I didn't see anything. Did all of you see that? - No, we didn't see anything! - I didn't see it too! Is there still law and order? Don't worry. I'm responsible for your work assessment. It's all right, as long as you are still here. Subtitle translation by Jacqueline Fong
