[MUSIC PLAYING] [WOLF HOWLING] [ROWDY LAUGHTER] Howdy, Sheriff Parker. Evening, Lily. How's business? Same as always. I suppose you'll be having the usual. Double shot of red eye. Reckon there ain't much for you to do around here these days, Sheriff. Not since I rounded up six [INAUDIBLE] and a hole in the head gang last month. No, things are mighty peaceful around these parts. Maybe too peaceful. [GUNSHOT] Tell me about it. Just another one horse town in the great interstellar nowhere. Can't even get decent cable around here. I'm happy. Ain't you happy, Lily? I'm always listening to the old timers talk about the good old days back when they were men here. Men? We get along just fine without them. Yeah, but don't you kind of feel like something's missing? Like what? Having kids or something like that. Trust me, Lily, when I say we don't need men to be happy, OK? Besides there hasn't been one here for eons. What do you think one's going to do, just drop down out of the sky? Well, no. I got to unwind. [MUSIC PLAYING] My goodness. Just letting my hair down is all. I see. Are you trying to tell me you don't like to have every once in a while, Delia? As mayor of this town, I do have to keep up appearances. Oh, bull shit. What's on your mind, Sarah? Well, Lily was talking something about the old days. And? She was mentioning something about men. Men? Uh-huh. I haven't heard that word in ages. You ever think about men, Delia? We've run this town a long time without men, Sarah. I know. I'm not saying that we need men to get along. I'm just saying it might be nice to have some around to use as pets or something. And who would clean up after them? Not me. We'd sure save a fortune on batteries. Well, I can certainly see what's on your mind. Men are only good for one thing. But we do all right for ourselves around here. Don't worry. You two had better call a cab. I wish there were men around here, so there. Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might make my wish come true tonight. Just my luck. I wish on a star, and one falls right from the sky. [MUSIC PLAYING] Next order of business, I would like to create a new town ordinance concerning the curbing of horses on our city streets. Morning, Mayor. Morning, Bessie. Well, I'll be tarred and feathered. What's going on here, Parker? Where'd you find this poor soul? She was laying in the remains of some strange metal carriage down there in Hang 'em High Valley. Oh, you mean a space ship. A space ship? This person's from another planet, Parker. Well, that explains a lot. Strangest woman I've ever seen. I mean, look how short her hair is and she could do with a shave, too. Sheriff, this is not a woman. It's a man. A man? A man? Yes, a man. He probably took a wrong turn on the intergalactic highway and crashed here. Sounds like a typical man, all right. He probably needs some medical attention, too. I'll take care of him. He can stay in the room over my saloon. Awfully nice of you, Lily. Awfully quick of you, Lily. Look, maybe he should stay at the jail. Maybe he's dangerous. Look, I found this thing next to him, some sort of device or something. Maybe he came to enslave us. Maybe you've seen too many science fiction movies. Well, I found him first. He stays at Lily's, end of discussion. The rest of you go about your business. After all, a strange man falling from the sky isn't all really that big a deal. Hi. Hi. Where in the hell am I? Oh. And why do I feel like I just got whacked over the head with a 9 iron? You're in the room over in my saloon. Which is where? Oh, Pucker Bush. Pucker Bush, you're kidding me? Look, I didn't name it. I just live here. Let me guess. I was in a bar last night. I came up to you. You drank a lot. Then we came back to your place and did a little mattress mambo. Actually you had a crash landing. Your spacesuit was ruined. Look, sweetheart, I don't crash. But you did. I saw it. My warp drive malfunctioned, OK? I had to make an emergency landing. Look, I need to get on the horn to somebody. Where's my transgalactic communicator? Oh. This? Yeah. Shit. Must've broke in the crash. Well, I thought you said you had an emergency landing. Look, I need to speak with your leader, the guy in charge here. But there are no guys. No guys? You mean, like, you're the only one here? No, I didn't say that. Actually there's a large number of people here, just no men. You mean just women? All women, nobody but women? All women. Why do I feel like I just woke up in an Abbott and Costello movie all of a sudden? What? Nothing. So what happened to all the guys anyway? Well, the way the old timers tell it, there was a horrible mining accident about 20 years ago. A tunnel collapsed. All the men died. All the men were in a mine shaft. I didn't say that they were smart men. So have you ever seen a man before? And I'm the only one on this whole planet, just me and a bunch of women? Well, as much as I'd like to live out this beer commercial, I got responsibilities. That's one thing you need to know about guys. We've got a lot of responsibilities. Wait. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I know. You want me to stay so you can experience what it's like to be with a man, right? Well, another place, another time maybe. Right now, I've got responsibilities. Actually, the mayor told me not to let you go anywhere because you might be dangerous. Oh, yeah? Well, I'd like to see somebody just try and stop me. Wait! [MUSIC PLAYING] I will take that. Thank you very much. Sheriff Parker! Sheriff Parker! The man's getting away. Let me guess. Wild Lil [INAUDIBLE]. I told him to stay put, but he wouldn't listen. The name is Parker, Sarah Parker. And I'm the sheriff in these here parts. Great. I hate women cops. Well, bad luck for you. Look, why don't you just come along with me to the jail and we can end this thing peacefully? I've got a better idea. Why don't you get out of my way, or I'm going to fry your ass like a side of bacon? Looks like you're a little outgunned, [INAUDIBLE].. It was a joke. I was just kidding. You girls have no sense of humor. Looks like you're going to be my guest for a little while. WOMAN: That's right. You tell him. Hey, baby, I know my rights. What about my phone call? We don't have any phones here. OK, well, what about my-- my lawyer? Don't I get fair legal counsel? There's a little thing here called Frontier Justice. This here badge gives me the right to do whatever I see fit to carry out the law. Nice badge. You got a name, Tex? Look, don't call me Tex. It makes me feel like I'm in an all-female episode of Gunsmoke or something. Look, my name is Commander Steve Rogers. I'm from Earth. Commander? You made that up. No, I didn't. You mean to tell me that they gave a rank like that to a man? Look, dollface, where I'm from, things are done a little differently. Oh, so you're telling me that the men run your world? No, I didn't exactly say that. OK, then the women run it. No, I didn't exactly-- look, you're screwing me up. Trust me, space man. It wasn't that hard to do. Whew! My goodness, it certainly is getting hot in here. Yeah, hot. Can I ask you a question, Commander Steve Rogers? No, just Commander Steve. OK, just Commander Steve. How is it where you come from? How's what? You know, sex. What's it like? It's pretty good, actually. Yeah, it's pretty good. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm on Cosmic Bloopers and Practical Jokes, ain't I? I knew it! I knew it. Somebody's going to come in here soon, and we're going to cut to commercial, right? You know, I don't have the slightest idea what you're talking about. But I like it. Oh, boy. Don't you want to know what I might have on under this outfit? Chaps? Or maybe nothing at all. I don't think this is standard police procedure. No, it's that frontier justice thing. Well, it sure beats the hell out of getting hung by the old oak tree. Howdy, Lily. How's your patient? Oh, in jail. In jail? Well, he sort of woke up, and then he sort of got loose. Then he sort of went apeshit in the middle of town. And then Sheriff Parker comes through to put him in jail. I leave you girls alone for one hour. Do you think Parker's prettier than me? What? Now why would you ask me a question like that? I don't know. You've never asked me a question like that before, Lily. Well, I never thought about it before. You never thought about it before because there was never any reason to think about it before, Lily. What do you mean? I mean, you're concerned about your looks because there's a man around, and you're worried that Sheriff Parker is going to take that man away from you. Well, he is kind of cute. Cute, ha. That's how it all starts. First everybody thinks he's a woman with a 5 o'clock shadow. Now everybody thinks he's cute. Next thing you know, he's going to be standing around in a mine shaft, saying, gee, I wonder what that rumbling sound is. Take my advice, Lily. Don't get attached to him. Why not? Because men leave, that's why not. They also always forget to put the toilet seat back down. It never works out. They always wind up breaking your heart. Trust me. Now you're going to be a model prisoner, right? Oh, boy. Wow. How do you manage to walk around with something like that sticking out of you? What? That. Oh, well, it's not always that big. I mean, it's a special circumstance. Space man. Yeah? You're going to be my bitch tonight. Shit. I'm handcuffed. I'm in jail, and my butt hurts. This is not good. Kinky. Let me guess, Sheriff Parker did her frontier justice routine, right? And who the hell do you supposed to be, the town's school marm? I happen to be the mayor of Pucker Bush. The mayor, right. OK, mayor. I need to make a long distance phone call. To where? To Earth? Well, I'm afraid you're out of luck there, Commander Rogers. You see, all our communication equipment was in the mine shaft when it collapsed on the men 20 years ago. You're kidding, right? Needless to say, Pucker Bush was voted Dumbest Planet of the Year that year. OK, well, how about this? How about you give me my transgalactic communicator, and I'll try and fix it or something? Why? So you could pull that same stunt you did in town square? Hey, I was under duress at the time. That's no excuse, and you know it. In fact, oh, girls. What are you doing? Well, Commander Rogers, there happen to be laws in this town. And you happen to have broken several of them Yeah, so? So there has to be a trial. A trial? I have to go to court? This is the wild frontier. There are no courts. [INAUDIBLE] serve as judge, jury, and executioner. Oh, come on, lady. I didn't hurt anybody. I'm not even from here. Do you honestly think that I meant to land here? When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Rome? There were guys in Rome, chickie poo. Chickie poo? He is really asking for it. What's going on? Oh, no. Oh, fuck. [APPLAUSE] Please let this be one of those guilty conscience dreams that I get whenever I sleep with some chick and then I leave her place before she wakes up. Greetings, spare citizens of Pucker Bush. Thanks for the great time, by the way. Yeah, sure. No, really. It was wonderful. Yeah, I'm sure I'll cherish the memories for the rest of my life. We have recently received, as I'm sure most of you have already heard, a visitor from another planet. Now we here in Pucker Bush like to think of ourselves as hospitable and generous folk. But sometimes this could be a bad thing. You see, this visitor, the first man to set foot in our community in over 20 years, has taken this hospitality and thrown it right back into our faces. Hey, I throw hospitality in anybody's face. Settle down, Commander Rogers. After all, you're on trial. Yeah, how could I forget? Now as I was saying, our kindness was rewarded by this man's wanton and malicious acts of violence against our law abiding townsfolk. You're making me sound like Hannibal Lecter, for Christ's sake. The defendant is therefore charged with intent to commit violence, reckless endangerment, propositioning an officer of the law. Frontier justice. Littering, excessive usage of derogatory female nicknames, and crash landing on a planet without a permit. Now, how does the defendant plead to these charges? Insanity. Well, since the defendant has decided to be a smart ass, I'll leave his fate in your hands. WOMAN: Hang him high. Wait a minute. Just wait a minute. Yes, Lily. Maybe we should let the man tell his side, you know, just to make things fair. Fair? Just because he's a man doesn't mean he shouldn't be treated like a woman, right? I mean, he can't help it if he's kind of stupid and doesn't take other people into consideration, can he? Thanks for your help. Very well then. Go ahead and tell your side. And make it quick. Hi. Hi. My name's Steve. And I'm a Capricorn. My favorite color is aquamarine. And my turn offs are Jerry Lewis movies and guys who wear sandals with black socks. [CLEARING THROAT] I believe you had a point to make. Right, a point. Well, the point is, uh, so you see, I was flying this rocket full of sick children to a hospital on the other side of the galaxy. Excuse me, commander. But I don't believe I saw any sick children when I found you. I did, however, see a sign painted on the side of your strange metal carriage, though. It read Joe's Intergalactic Garbage Service. OK, fine. Fine! So I'm a garbage man. So what? So you broads are-- women-- you women are going to send me up the river just because I have a lousy job? Look. You see, this isn't an easy thing for me to deal with. I'm a million miles away from home. I'm all alone on a strange planet, just like ET. Did you see that movie? I mean, that was pretty sad, huh? Look, you girls are going to have do what you feel is the right thing to do. But all I got to say is that I'm really sorry for what I did. And if you let me go, I promise that I'll get out of here just as soon as I can get a ride. Well, I guess that's all I have to say. Well, now that the defendant has had his say, how do the citizens of Pucker Bush decide? CROWD: Guilty! Guilty? Guilty? What? I just put up my heart to you people, and you call me guilty? Oh, and they call us insensitive. I'm afraid the townspeople's decision is final. Oh, swell. Now for your sentencing. Look, could you at least get me drunk before you hang me? I mean, I don't want to die a sober man. The defendant is hereby fined $40 and will be issued a written citation by Sheriff Parker for his crimes against this town. What? You mean you're not going to hang me? Hang you? We don't hang people here. We just have trials here because the acoustics are so good. Don't tell me you actually thought we were going to hang you? Yeah, what a stupid idea. DELIA: It's starting. SARAH: What do you mean? DELIA: Well, can't you tell? The women already can't keep their eyes off of him. Next thing you know, they're going to be buying him flowers. And then they're going to start writing his name over and over again, putting little hearts over the I's. I don't think there's any I's in Steve Rogers, Delia. My point is, is that these women were just babies when the mining accident happened. They don't know what men can be like. Oh, and you do? History speaks for itself. Maybe Earth men are different. And who better to know than you? You certainly seem awful eager to fly off, don't you? Yeah. Just imagine if you were stranded on a planet full of guys. Oh, my. Yeah, it sounds great. But it's no picnic, believe me. Plus you'd probably have to take a lot of vitamins, if you know what I'm saying. That's it. The [INAUDIBLE] on impact. Would you guys happen to have any around? Like I told you, all our communication gear was in the mineshaft when it collapsed. I should have asked for a shovel. Now you listen here, Mr. Man. Nobody told you to crash land on this here planet. Maybe you should have picked a planet with a freaking Radio Shack on it. Maybe I should have! And another thing-- you owe me 40 bucks. Bill me. Get out of my way, you [INAUDIBLE].. [INAUDIBLE] Whoa! Oof. [SNICKERING] Ugh, shit. Don't you girls have some Western chick type thing you could be doing right now? That's a good color on you. I'm glad I could amuse you. Well, now that my dignity is flushed down the toilet, do you think you could get me just some soap and water, please? [BIRD CRY] [SIGHS] This is more like it. [KNOCKING] What are you doing? Oh, I thought you might need a towel or something. No, I mean that thing you're doing with your hand in front of your eyes. I'm trying not to look at you. Why? Well, it's customary, ain't it? You ain't supposed to look at somebody's, um, anatomy if you don't know him. Wait a second. Now you could damn near hang me, but now you're worried about invading my privacy? No I'm really not that bad a person, Commander Rogers. Nope. You just have some weird hang ups about men, that's all. Maybe I need to be proven wrong. I need to ask you something, Commander Rogers. What's that? Did you enjoy yourself with Sheriff Parker? Yeah, I guess so. You know, you look awfully lonely in that tub. Do I? Maybe you need some help in, um, lathering up. Well, what about not liking men? I have nothing against men. I think every woman should own one. You know, I'm curious. About what? How do you manage to walk around with that thing? Space boy. Space boy! Wake up! What? Can I get you something? How about a positronic [INAUDIBLE] sprocket? Sorry, I can't help you with that. Yeah, I didn't think so. Well, how about some clothes? I mean, this is comfortable and all, but I'm starting to feel a little beef-cakey, if you know what I mean. Yes, let me show you. STEVE: So what is this place anyway? Well, 20 years ago when the mine collapsed, the women locked all the men's belongings here in this building. It must have cost you gals a small fortune in mothballs, huh? Do you want the clothes or not? Sorry. Well, here they are. Go ahead and try something out here. Oh, god. What's wrong? What's wrong? This is the same jacket that they used to wear on The Brady Bunch. That's what's wrong. I think it's kind of nice. Yeah? Well, I bet you think this is pretty nice, too, huh? I think you got the legs for it. I think I'll shoot for something a little more masculine. Hey, you know what? I just remembered. This stuff is like 20 years out of date. Beggars can't be choosers. Well, I know plenty of beggars who would probably go naked before they wore this stuff. The men in this town actually wore this stuff, huh? No wonder they all got trapped in a mine shaft. Actually, I think it's kind of cute. You know, I'm beginning to seriously question your taste. I just don't want to look like one of the Bee Gees, that's all. Here's an idea for you. Why don't you stop being a bitch and try something out? OK, but I'm not going to like this. [MUSIC PLAYING] Howdy, Delia. You and I need to talk, Sarah. About what? About Steve Rogers, that's what. OK, I'm listening. You slept with him. So did you. I don't know what you're talking about. You're the only politician I ever met, Delia, that couldn't lie to save her own life. OK. OK, I did. So what? I'm the mayor. Oh, brother. My point is I don't believe you behaved very professionally sleeping with your own prisoner. Oh. And you did? Don't argue with me, Sarah. I thought you didn't need men, Delia. I was curious. More like horny. I'm your boss. Don't argue with me. Ooh. You're jealous. That's it, isn't it? You are exactly what you're accusing everybody else of being. You're jealous because I slept with him before you did. That's just plain nonsense. I don't think so, Delia. I forbid you to see him again. Why? So you can have him all to yourself? Look here, Sarah. We're fighting over him. When is the last time you and I have ever had a fight? I don't think he's the reason we're fighting, Delia. We were perfectly happy before we had a man to worry about. Well, I'm not worried about it. What's that supposed to mean? It means that when the time comes, the best woman will win. You? I don't see why not. If I was you, Sarah, I'd be real careful when you turn your back on me. Damn that man for coming here. Oh, come on already. Are you just going to stand there and look silly, or are you coming with me? Why am I wearing this hat for again? I forgot. Well, you're more than welcome to go back in there and try something else on, if you'd like. I think I saw a pair of plaid bell bottoms that would fit you perfectly. I just feel kind of weird. That's all. Why? Don't they dress like this back on Earth? Yeah. There was this one guy a while back who used to dress like this. Who, the Lone Ranger? No, the cowboy from the village people. Why are they staring at us like that? I don't know. They've never acted this way before. But I don't think it's a bad thing. [MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me, you have a quarter? CROWD: There you go. [LAUGHTER] Got him. This is getting real weird. Give me a bottle of red eye and a crazy straw. Do you really think you ought to be drinking, mayor? Who cares? This town's going straight to hell anyway, ever since that [INAUDIBLE] showed up. Mayor Westwood, you're already drunk. Well, I'm as sober as a nun. All right, so I'm as sober as an alcoholic nun. So what and who cares? So now are you going to bring me my whiskey, or am I just going to have to frequent another establ-- esta-- joint. I really shouldn't be helping you here. Well, you know, I wouldn't be needing to be sitting here drinking to forget my problems if it wasn't for that no good sheriff I appointed. Drunk bitch. Mayor Westwood, keep it down. What can I do you for? Milk. CROWD: Milk? Well, I don't hold my liquor too well. You see, there was this one time when I was on star base MK Naomi. I was doing tequila shooters with some Jolt cola. I guess we don't have to get into that right now. So what do you ladies do on your time off? LILY: This is about it. Jeez, Lily. This is pretty tame for the so-called wild frontier. [COUGHS] What was in that? About 80 proof, fly boy. I think my tongue is going numb. Oh, space man. Oh, yeah, it's time to rock and roll. [MUSIC PLAYING] Work it, boy! Yeah hoo hoo! Hey! I just said yahoo in a public place. Why would I do that? Woo! Hey, I kind of liked that shirt. Well, I kind of happen to like you without that shirt, you big, hunky, messy primate you. I like him without his pants on better, so there. Why don't you just keep your hands where they belong, you dime store [INAUDIBLE] want to be? My goodness, Delia, we're getting our panties in a bunch. I'm getting real dizzy here, folks. I ought to fire you. Well, it's too late because I was voted in. Fine, I'll impeach you then. Can't we all just get along? BOTH: Shut up! I'm warning you, Delia. They don't call me Snake Eyes for nothing. It could be a birth defect. If you want defect, I'll show you defect. Hey, I know you. We've got to get you sobered up, space man. Do you see where this is leading, Sarah? Do you see what happens when there's a man around? All I see is some drunk jealous bitch who can't stand to have any competition. Somebody get me my gun. Take it outside. Space man, how's your head? Well, I can finally see in color again. It was the dancing, that's what did it. I danced? Really? Was I any good? Best you don't know about it. Please tell me I didn't do the robot again. What are you looking at? Stars. I love to watch them. Any particular reason? You don't always have to have a reason to like something, space boy. Sometimes it just kind of happens that way. Look, my name's not space boy. And it's not space man, and it's not Earth man. And it definitely isn't male chauvinist pig's ass. Who called you that? I didn't. Well, my mom did once, but that's not the point. See, the point is my name's Steve Rogers. You can call me Steve. Or yeah, you can even call me Mr. Rogers, but call me by my name, my real name. OK. Oh, hey. I found this behind the bar. Oh, my God, I can't believe you found six-fingered Betty's old Lancaster! Yeah. Don't tell me you know how to play that. Well, no, but. Not even one song? Well, I know one song. I mean, not all of it, just-- just parts of it. Well, go ahead. Really? You sure? OK? [GUITAR] (SINGING) Oh, me me me me. Well, give me a home where the buffalo roam and the deer and the antelope play. And seldom is heard a bah bah blah blah blah. Did you make that up? I made up that blah blah blah part. I like your dancing better. Can I ask you a question, Steve? Sure, go ahead. When you leave here, are you going to remember me? Of course I'm going to remember you. Do you think you'll ever come back and visit? Well, honestly, I don't know. I mean, it would be nice and everything, but I-- There's other places you'd rather be. I never really thought of it that way. Maybe other women, too. I really don't know what I want. Do you want me? I could give it a shot. Well, I guess this is good night then. Yeah, I guess so. What do we do now? Oh, I'm tired. I think I'm just going to turn in. Um, well, OK. You can if you want to. I mean, if you really, really want to. Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm just going to turn in. Um, well, OK. Good night then. OK, good night. [KNOCKING] What are you doing here? I came to see you, my darling. Darling? Mm-hmm. You don't want to live the rest of your life with Delia Westwood. She smells like a horse. You can't live with that. I really don't understand what you're talking about. Well, let me show you. [KNOCKING] Shit! That's Lily. You gotta hide. Hello, fly boy. Oh, hi. What you got under that sheet? Uh, chaps? Uh-huh. Oh, my. I see you're ready for me. You know, Commander Roger, you have needs. I have needs. Why can't we just meet on common ground? I don't know. Do you like reruns of Welcome Back, Carter? I was thinking of something a little more immediate. OK, how about reruns of [INAUDIBLE].. You don't want to get involved with Sheriff Parker, do you? I mean, she's nice and all, but those handcuffs, doesn't that strike you as just a little bit odd? You'd be much wiser if you were to get involved with somebody who's just a little more straightforward. Well, I'm really not looking for a commitment right now. Men, what do I have to do to get your attention? That's a good start. Shit, that's Lily. Hide! She can hide down here because I don't like it much. You? Mm-hmm. Steve? I was just thinking that, you know, if I try to come onto you, then you'd probably turn me down. But I'm thinking maybe we should try anyway. What's going on in here? Well, first of all, I was just trying to get some sleep. Oh, yeah, why don't you try telling that to all them sick children you were trying to take across the galaxy? There really is a good explanation for all this. I am not playing sloppy seconds with Sheriff Parker slave boy. Oh, slave boy? I wore those handcuffs exactly one time. That doesn't make me a slave boy. ALL: All up. I was here first, gals. I'm the one that found him in the prairie. He's mine, end of story. Well, why didn't you just cut out the middle man and brand him on the S, snake lips? You guys! Why don't you just find somebody else, Delia? He's mine. - Why? So you could dazzle him with your extensive collection of studded leather oven mitts? You guys. What do you want? You're treating him like a side of potatoes. So what's the problem? Well, he's a sensitive human being. He has feelings. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, most of which are located in his groin. How would you know? I bet having you is like doing a Frigidaire on PMS. You guys are best friends. Forget it. She's a hypocrite, and worse, she's the mayor. I'm out of here. She better not be up for re-election. Maybe you had better sleep someplace else tonight. Fine! Women! [DUELING MUSIC] Howdy, Sheriff. Delia. Reckon it's time to see who the better woman is. I reckon it is. You two had better cut this out. Stay out of this, Lily. This is between me and her. Give up the space man, Delia. He's mine. You know, you're really starting to sound like a broken record. Get a new line. - Get a new life. - Bimbo. Bitch. Hold on. Hold on. Now just wait a minute. What are you doing here? Yeah, you're the one who started this whole thing. Look, I'm just trying to stop you two from making a horrible mistake. Now, look. I know I'm a good looking guy and everything, but I'm just not worth all this. Of course you're not worth this. No man is ever worth the aggravation they cause. Hey. Now in case you can't tell, we're getting ready to kill each other. Do you mind? I'm not moving. You're just going to have to kill me, too. Woo! I must have forgot to load this damn thing. I guess I did, too. I must have been so mad I forgot. Mad? Hell, I was fuming. Hey, want to go for a beer? OK, but just one. I'm on duty. OK, let's go. I'll buy. Hi. Hi. Look, I really need to talk to you. About what? About last night and about tomorrow. I don't understand you. Look, we both know that without a positronic [INAUDIBLE] sprocket, I'm stuck here for the rest of my life. So which one are you going to choose? You mean Parker or the mayor? You're going to choose one of the two of them, aren't you? I don't want them. I want somebody else. Oh, really? I want someone like you. Good luck. Oh, you mean me. I knew it. I knew you'd eventually come to your stupid male senses. Well, I don't know anybody else that I'd rather be stuck on this backwards planet with for the rest of my life. Well, you realize, of course, that means I'm going to have to keep wishing on them stars. Just make sure I'm not driving it, OK? You even squawked around like a chicken. Oh, God. I'm really going to miss Earth, you know that. Or maybe just a little bit. You don't have to, you know. I don't think I'm ever going to be able to go back. I mean, I can't get in touch with anyone. And Pucker Bush isn't on any of the astrologers' charts. I mean, if it was, there'd probably be a lot of guys around here. Maybe there is a way back to your home world. What? Promise you won't get mad? OK, I promise. A positronic [INAUDIBLE] sprocket! You've had this all the time? Yeah. Well, my dad gave it to me. He thought that it was from a gumball machine. I've had it for years. You've had this all the time, and you weren't going to tell me. You were just going to let me rot here? Well, you said you wanted to spend the rest of your life with me. I take it back. Typical man. I said this would happen, didn't I? Bye. CROWD: Bye! Good bye, Steve Rogers. Hey, Lily. Yeah? Let's go catch a Welcome Back, Carter rerun. Boy, I can't wait for the next guy that shows up. He's mine. What did you say, bitch? You heard me. Bimbo. [MUSIC PLAYING]
