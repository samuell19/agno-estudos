Riki. Riki! Riki! Riki! Riki! What does this look like to you? Just a regular old house, right? An ordinary house on a happy occasion. A house much like yours. But what if I was to tell you there was someone else living in your house without your knowledge? And I don't mean the hamster that got loose last summer, no, no, no. It's actually someone you've never seen before. Perhaps you've heard of them being referred to by names such as Lars, Goblins or House Elves. In any case, they are the invisible spirit of a house and in our story, they're called Finns. There's no creature quite like a Finn. I know it's hard to imagine, but these hidden roommates live in every house in the entire world. No, no, really! Even in yours. Uh, honey dear, have you seen my glasses? - Your glasses? - Oh! On my head. Finns keep things in order. And ultimately, it's Finns who turn your house into a home... sweet... home. Finns have a duty to watch over everyone and everything within their home. Ah! Of course, Finns take special care of their family's pets... Wuh? Whether they be tiny or plump, tabby or ginger. Whoa! This is gonna go viral in no time! They even keep an eye on you when you stay up way too late and snooze through your alarm. Huh? Ugh! Oh, no, again?! You get the picture. The chief goal of a Finn is to bring peace and harmony into the home. It's their way of life and their guiding purpose. No Finn would ever dream about breaking this glorious tradition. And that, my friends, is the end of our story. Or it would have been, had it not been for one singularly unusual Finn. Oh, I refuse to stay in this house for one more minute! Well, it was your idea to rent it, remember? Oh, yeah?! Well, why didn't YOU talk me out of it?! I, uh, didn't know. Maybe if you'd done the walk-through like I asked you to, you would have noticed the evil energy! But you didn't because you never listen! What now? Oh, never mind. It's fine, we'll just go and live with your mother. What? Has it come to that? - It can't be any worse! - Oh, such a pity! But they had to go! Ah! - ♪ Let's do it! Let's do it! ♪ - FINN: Whoo!

I just keep forgetting the name of this town. - Berg, sweetie, Berg. - Mm! I hope Christine's able to make some new friends in this town. Every time I make new friends we have to move again, so I'm not sure that I see the point. Anyway, detectives don't really need friends. We have to focus on our investigations. Do you really think there'll be anything to investigate in this adorable little town? Mom, there's an adorable little town just like this one in my book. "The mastermind's trail "led straight to a quiet mountain town, "and there was no way of knowing "that all of its citizens, from the police to the baker, "belonged to a criminal gang. "The very last thing Amanda expected to find was..." - Our own amusement park! - Oh, look, Christine! They even have a Ferris wheel! Anyone up for a ride? - I am! - Yeah! Ha-ha! Dad, you just missed the turn. Ha! Thanks for watching, Sherlock. Nothing gets past this one. All done? That went by fast. What's the point? I already figured out who did it. Oops, boom gate! That was a close one! The detective enters the shot and cautiously looks for clues. Did I not say cautiously?! Aha! He sees something suspicious! Might this be the evidence he's looking for? That's it, keep going! JB, that trash won't empty itself. Yeah, can I do it later? I need to get into character and warm up for my big scene. Tick-tock! Huh! Let's set up for the next scene! Extras, stand by! What a strange set of circumstances indeed. But even this crime has to have a villain, a Violet Villain, that is. Ah! Oh! Bah-bah-bah-bah! Wha... Wha... What? What in the world? Cut! What are you doing?! You're just supposed to walk by, that's all! Hear me out. I've got an idea that would make the scene so much better! I've got one as well. Get off of my set! Want another take? Uh... Nah, that'll do. Moving on, people! What's taking so long?! A tortoise moves faster than you. Shoulda hired him! You must be the newbies! - Uh-huh, uh-huh! - Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah! And we're so grateful to be here! And of course, we're both classically trained. Good for you. Welcome to our micro-budget nightmare... I mean, our hit detective series, 'The Violet Villain'. Here's your pages. Oh! Will the rest be coming? Our director never gives out the whole script so we can keep up the intrigue, even amongst the actors. So much for intrigue. The butler did it. What makes you think that? Could be that man in the butler costume with the knife. - Elementary. - Alright! Well, here are the keys to your new house for the time being. Oh, thank you. Uh, it's not what I'd call a "Wow!" Let's face it, you guys aren't a "Wow!" Hey! Stop! Where you taking that?! I need it for the next scene... We actually have lines in the scene! I'm so proud! OK, let's give this new scene a try. Quiet on the set, and action! Cut! Is that your idea of an evil laugh? Come on! Take 10! Hmm. I know how you must feel. It must be torture for someone with the talent and unparalleled genius you have to be surrounded by these second-rate hacks with no instincts. Take this actor, who should be the star... - He's so wooden! - Huh? I mean, where's the passion? How dare you say that?! I'm oozing with passion! Just give me a shot! I'll show you how it's done! To perform for a director of your stature, you have to put your whole body into your art! If you give me the role of this villain, I will gladly give you my heart! Huh? Uh, what... what do you mean? Yep. Just when I thought I'd seen it all. I guess I didn't count on you! Someone get this fool off my set once and for all! Whoa! Oh! Whoa! What? You're not an actor! You're not a villain! You're a janitor! And as of today, you're not even that anymore because you... are... fired! No! But I love this more than anything... I said you're fired! That's showbiz, isn't it? - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh, sure is. And somebody turn off that blasted water! Sweetie, are you sure that this is the right house? What? Again? Yep. Pretty sure the key would have fit if the lock hadn't been broken. - Well... - Whoa, whoa, whoa! I like it better than the last one! This is my house! Where are you putting all that junk, huh? Eugh! Looks like a crime scene in here. Don't worry, honey. We'll make it a home. - Ugh. Awesome. - You call this awesome? What would be awesome is if you got outta here! Here's the perfect spot for my record collection. This is also the perfect spot for my prank collection! It'll be nice and cosy before you know it! Before YOU know it, you're gonna be out on your rumps! You have no idea what you stepped in! I just stepped in something sticky. A couple of comforts, some soft music and our perfect little toaster are all this family needs to feel at home. I'm with you, babe! Yoink! Sweetie, have you seen the toaster? And there you have it - half a dozen delectable doughnuts. I wish you could have seen it. We were just standing there and then we all went like this. - $3.50, please. - Everybody started laughing. It was the last thing they expected. I didn't even mind getting in trouble. Thank you, kindly. Please come again. Hello! I, uh, haven't seen you around here. My name is... Mark. It's stitched right there on your backpack. Of course it is. - Oh! - Is this her? Didn't you just move into the creepiest house in town? You should know that nobody stays for long in that house. We never stay anywhere for long. But you should be careful. There have been some spine-chilling tales of that place. Come on, everything has a logical explanation. Aw! And I've heard that there are sounds of bones crunching in the night, or even worse... CHIPS! Not to mention flying toasters! That house is haunted! And that means that you're gonna need a brave... no, incredibly brave friend. Uh, thank you, but I've got this. I'll haunt this town until my last breath! And you'll never, ever catch me! No, never! We're safe. Huh? Sorry, Mark, but you never had a chance! I've had it. I've been trying to tell you what's going on, but you never, ever listen! Maybe I'd listen if you stopped yelling at me like a banshee! When did you become so heartless? I'd rather live with a snake than live with you! At least it would be a little bit warmer! These guys are out of their minds! Oh, it's almost too easy! Then why don't you go live with your snake? Stop hissing at me! Brrr. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I think you missed a cue here. - Huh? - Oh, did I? Yeah, you forgot to say, "Then move on and move out!" Oh, that's right. You've gotta be kidding. They're just saying lines from a scene! And try it with more intensity. This is unacceptable! Yeah, great note. Let's do it again! Shouldn't you guys have left by now? - What time is it? - Time to go. - I can't believe it. - We lost track of time! It all felt so real! - So sinister! - Mwah! Do you know how much I love you? - I guarantee I love you more! - Mwah! - Our first rehearsal! - Hurry! I'm gonna do more than just rehearse. It's opening night! Where do you think you're going? Wha... What's going on? Hm. You thought you'd get away with it, but the fickle finger of fate just dialled your phone number. You'll never catch the Violet Villain in a blackout! Take it easy, Christine. Everything has a logical explanation. Haunted houses don't exist. Brrr! Take this! Ugh! What the... Hey, wait! Aren't you going to introduce yourself? Oh, no, you don't! Will you just stop for a second so that I can... Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, oh! Oh! What did she think she was doing? Did she just really bite me?! Ow! Oh, boy. What are you? Huh? What?! You can actually see me? - Well, I guess that I can. - Oh, not good! Oh! It's because you yanked out some of my fur and you... Oh! A whole tuft of fur! Huh? And I need it! You give me back my fur! Now, wait a second. First I want to know what you are. Oh! I'm a Finn. This is my house and that is my fur! - Give it! - Finns don't really exist. Oh, that's right! Just hang onto that thought and give me back my fur! I think you're trying to say that the reason I can see you is because I have a little piece of your fur. In what world is that chunk a little piece? - Come on, give it back or... - Or you'll do what? Or else I'll start screaming and banging on the walls. I will go to crazy-town! This is all crazy-town. - But also interesting. - You don't understand! If the other Finns were to find out that you can see me, then I'll... I mean, we'll be in serious trouble! So then there are more of you? Uh... Nope. Finnick, are you in there? Expecting someone? Don't move! You see, I told you he was still at home, guys! - Huh? - Huh? Hm. Is that one of the new ones? Weirdo! Why'd she freeze in the middle of the room? 'Cause she's a few hairs short of a tuft! Uh, yeah. Your house always gets the weirdos. Or the lazy ones. Uh, or the lazy weirdos! - Yeah. - Oh! What? Oh, nothing, just a doughnut. What, are you nuts? What? It's practically clean! What's a hungry Finn supposed... Now, what's that she's holding? Oh, that? That's nothing! You know those kids and their crafting. Let's go. We'll be late for the meeting. That's right. Oh, look what time it is. Time for me to go and do something totally weird! Don't even think about following us! I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that I can't see or hear you. - Ohh! - Finnick! Tick-tock already or we'll be late to our weekly Finn-counter! You got that right! Well, I've never left a single trace! That's 'cause hygiene is my middle name. And I never take anything when they're looking! They can't even stomach a UFO, let alone a Finn like you! You have to put safety first, Finnies! Hmm. I must say I... find myself surprisingly interested in this case. Order! Come on, Finns, quiet down now. I guess I officially declare our weekly meeting in session. Hey, I hear Finnick's got some new tenants! Finnick, tell us how it's going with your new guests. I hope they're not as rotten as the last ones! Uh... definitely not! They're perfectly normal! Not like your usual guests! Enough with all the mocking and bickering. We Finns gotta stick together! Like this gum sticks to my fuzzy rump! Finnick, is there something you're not saying? Uh, I heard Muffinn's human nearly burned down a film studio! Good one, Finnick! And he almost starred in a TV show. His career's really on fire! You know your man's not an actor. He's a janitor! No, he's an actor! You don't know my human at all! He's got a real gift! Yeah, a gift for being a total sad-sack loser! - Or a pro fire-starter! - Yeah, Muffinn! Maybe you should order him a fire extinguisher! And get a move on before he burns the whole city down! You don't understand anything! You know nothing of art! But... you'll... see. Let's hurry this up. I got 10 doughnuts on a soccer game! Mm-hm! Yep, just one last thing. Isn't it time for Sherlock to be off to sleep? Just one minute more. I'm conducting an investigation. Ah, and what will you call it? The up-all-night case? Funny, Mom. But I've got a suspect already, so it won't be long. Hm! Hm, you're so clever! Hm. Hmm. Yeah, Mom, and if you stop by the store, could you maybe pick up some... Let's see. Well, anything but cheese with black mould. We already have that. Yeah, yeah, I'll be here. 'K, 'bye. Huh? Hey there. Uh, hey there? - Mark. - Yeah, I remember. And your name's... Your name's Christine! Thanks, I nearly forgot. So I read that book of yours, and now I too am using the de... the de-de... The de... The defective method! - Deductive method. - That's what I meant. Uh, this house is actually pretty nice. I mean, creepy, but in a good way. You're the only creepy thing here! Oh, how much more do you expect me to take? I just thought I'd stop by. Did I see something? It was probably just a rat. A nasty big old furry green rat. Yeah, well, I-I-I was thinking maybe we could go see a movie, or, you know, just hang out? How about a thriller?! Uh... Wait, did you say a rat? Uh-huh. And actually, you're better off hanging out with someone who'll still be here in a couple weeks. Here! You thirsty, kid? Don't worry about it. It's all good. But I'm afraid I should be going now. So long, defective! It's only a little juice! Totally fine. See you later! Whew! Yeah, that wasn't too awkward at all. I mean, at least that time we spoke more than a few seconds. You and me gotta lay down some rules. You are forbidden to bring any people here! Hm! And what's so bad about people? Bad? Bad?! You break everything I care about. You're messy and noisy and you won't leave my house! Oh, and then you have the nerve to say my house is super creepy! I was one of the all-time greats until my house was rented to strangers! You people have turned this house into a three-ring circus! All of these babies, punks, little old ladies and harpists! They're destroying my home! How can you not see that if the house goes away, then the Finn goes away too! But humans don't care, do you?! ♪ Fire! ♪ Now get out of my house! Oh! - Oh! - ♪ Alright! ♪ Ohhh! So, over the years, I have come up with one true motto. No humans, no problems! Arggh! Why do all humans have to be so useless and loud all the time? Huh? Look! Just look at this! This ridiculous contraption! Every week it's the same thing! Ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh! Ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh-ruh! Please tell me why even bother planting grass if you won't let it grow?! Oh! Whoa! Run for your life! It's Finn versus machine! Don't let it cut my fur! - Let go! - Whoa! Hey! Do you know what would have happened if that thing cut my fur?! Well, I suppose you might look like an over-plucked, green chicken. And I'd be just as dumb! But your fur is fine. Oh! Have you looked back here? Ew, I don't want to look back there! You alright there? You're awfully quiet. I think you're even angrier than usual. Careful! Why would anyone drive a car like that? They never stop rocking from side to side. I don't like being tossed around like that! It's not my fault. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be here in the first place! Listen, you ought to learn how to control your temper. I'm not the least bit angry. I'm calm. Absolutely calm! Absolutely! Oh, yeah. Mm, 'bout time the coal arrived. Do you see what you've reduced me to? Hey! - Ow! - Oh! What do I do with you? Because seven ate nine. Hey! This way! Took 'em long enough to get us this coal! Wha... This isn't coal! What... What's the idea?! Huh! There's no driver! Looks like... popcorn? I never thought I'd say this, but run for your lives! It's popcorn! Go take your lunch break, Dad. I gotta call you back. Ugh! Stop! In the name of justice! Running will only make things worse. Huh? Run! It's a snack attack! Popcorn! Tasty popcorn! Popcorn! Get your popcorn here! Tasty popcorn! Huh? Mm! Popcorn! Tasty popcorn! Tasty popcorn! Taxi! Huh? Don't expect a positive review after this! Whoa! Please help me. Oh-ho! Juan Sanchez stars in the feel-good runaway train movie... Did you have to forget the popcorn?! This is just excessive. I told you to get the medium! What's this now, one of those flash mob thingies? What people consider entertainment these days! Stand by now, we go live in three... For the first time in 20 years, the news is actually interesting. That is, I'm reporting a major crime. The perpetrators have staged an eruption of a popcorn... a popcorn... a popcorn volcano that is now terrorising the entire town. Postal Service. You've got post. Huh? - Here you go. - Thanks so much. What do we have here? "To all the citizens of Berg, "I've only just begun, so in your face. "Yours truly, the Invisible Terror. "Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha-ha, ha, "ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-hee-ha..." TV news! That's how I'll warn people... Ugh! - Huh? - Check this out! Show the criminal's face to everyone in Berg! Look, kid, wait your turn. Can't you see we're on the air? - Please, just take a look! - Stop it! It's the scoop of the year. - Not now! - Come on, you have to see this! Hm! - Hey there! - Hm, I can't see anything. Nice try, young lady, but now you need to get on your merry way. Ha! We're back, and we have the latest! But I saw it with my own eyes. The case'll be solved by smart minds, while you stay up to date with handsome faces! And we're out. So tell me, how did I look, huh? You got mostly my good side, right? You can't always count on the news. I've got this! Mm! First you invade my home, then you take my fur, and now you come to me and say, "Please, Finnick, "I need your help." But you don't ask me with any kind of respect or offer anything in return. What I can offer is a real adventure! Huh? Adventure? What adventure? I'm a Finn, we don't have adventures! Which is why I need you to help me catch the main suspect. Because I'm pretty sure he's a Finn! Hm? Huh? I don't buy it. And give me one good reason why I should help. - Hey... - Huh? Hey, hey! Because you're not just helping me, you're helping the whole town. How about you just save the town while I wait here in this... suitcase! Just think about it. What can the police do against an invisible criminal? Only a very brave girl and the world's first Finn detective have any hope of saving Berg! Well, maybe I'll help, but only on three conditions. First of all, get down on your knees... and say you're sorry. Secondly, I want you to clean out my attic. While on your knees. And thirdly, you will give me back my fur this very instant! On your knees, naturally. We catch the culprit first, and then I'll give you your fur. - The fur first. - Nope. That's not gonna work. Fine then! Haggling's not my strong suit. But if you trick me, I'll hide all of your books and eat all of your candy, And I promise you'll be inspecting every glass before drinking for the rest of your life! - Get it? - Handshake? Paw slap. The truck was right here when I saw the Finn jump into it and speed away. You're not gonna find anything, and you're wasting my time. Uh-huh. Right. What do you make of this oil stain? There was once this nasty old lady who lived in my house, like, a few years back. And this one time, I spilled oil on the floor... It leaked from the engine! Can't you see, he left a trail! Come on, let's follow it! This is the end of it. What would a detective do next? Think! I don't suppose that you could tell me who it is if you take a little whiff of it? Take a whiff? Do I look like a dog?! - No, I thought maybe you... - Ha! YOU take a whiff! Just what do you think I am? You smell anything? - Just the scent of my own shame. - And allergies. Finnick! Uh. Huh? Eugh. Ew, what are you doing? Eugh. Oh, well, you can't say I didn't try, but it's just not going to work out. I'll take that fur. Well... - Mm... - Chop, chop. Not so fast. You and me are never gonna find that truck! This is what they mean by "a needle in a haystack". Accept it. You lost, the jig is up, the credits are rolling. Game over, Elvis has left the building, the carrots are cooked, the ship has sailed. What else can I possibly say? Just turn around. Yeah, I've heard that one before! And see, there's nothing there! - Whoa! - Oh! - The truck! - That's the one? And we're gonna catch it! You serious? I can't believe I signed up for this. Follow the trail! Sniff! Hang a left! Huh. Oh! Mm. Ha! Ha! Hey, look! It's that hilarious cat that walks up on its front legs! I knew this was gonna go viral as soon as I saw it! Do you think we can get that cat to do your job? Huh? Come on, keep up! This is as fast as I go! You may want to think about taking a bike next time! - Welcome aboard the... - I've got a better idea. - Come on! Hurry! - ..safest train in the world! Your very own professional train conductor... Come on! Move it, Finnick! To the destination safe and sound! We need to see the driver. The truck's right there! Should we get out and push the train? - What now?! - You wanted to keep up! Real funny! When we find out who this mysterious driver is, then I'm gonna... Oh, ow, ow, ow! - Come on! This way! - What? again? Are all chases so full of chasing? Sherlock Holmes must have been in better shape than me. - Excuse me! - Out of my way! What, no apology? Huh? Why should I apologise when you pushed me?! We can do this! - Too late! - Aw, rats! - The licence plate! - I saw! What is it? It's a rectangular metal plate with letters and numbers, but I didn't have time to read them. No, he's getting away! All is lost. I can't believe that a Finn is behind this. In my experience, it's people that mess things up. But what would you know about that? I know quite a lot, actually. I've lived in five towns. And I had friends in each one of them. We'd play games and hang out, and we talked about everything. And when I moved, did any of them even think about calling me? Hm? No way, I'm not like that. When you finally move out of my house, I promise I won't forget to call you. Ser-i-ous-ly... Ouch! Next time I'm riding in first class! And it only gets better from here! Oh! But how... how can that be right? That's physically impossible. I know, but it looks so real! I can't believe my eyes. How can there be two trains? Will you look at the screen already, you nitwit?! Huh? No, this simply cannot be happening! Eastbound 74, you must stop immediately. I repeat, stop immediately, right this minute! We've got to stop them! There's another train heading for you! There's no need to panic. We covered this... in class. Oh! That was the class I missed! Attention, all! It's time to hang on tight! Ugh! Huh? OK, everyone. Panic! Huh? What is this?! We have to get off the train! On the count of three. Three! I've never been on a train before. Is this normal? Not exactly! Oh, jeez, it's not even my shift! Well, I've got something to say to customer service about your train! Huh! Who's got a train anymore? Huh? Oh! Pfft! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Oh, hey, guys, gonna need your help here! What's going on here? Who is this? Ugh! I've got a schedule! You can't do... What's happening? Oh! Watch out! Get in here! Hurry! There's so much I haven't done yet! Come on, come on, come on! You've got this! Floor it! Faster, faster! I didn't mean that fast! Oh-ho-ho! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho! The weather at a glance. On the scene in Berg, dust and feathers swirl within a monstrous twister! This is not a typical weather pattern for Berg. Instead we find ourselves in a dusty doomsday, a feathered apocalypse, if you will! Ohhh! What is happening?! There's so many pranks I haven't pulled! We're going to be OK. Just calm down. - Not happening. - What are you doing?! You're doing great, but I'm pretty sure it's safer inside. Tell me, while I was gone, did you order a hot dog? A hot dog? Arggh! Definitely not that one! I won't even get to eat it! Just stay calm. It's all under control! Arggh! Brace yourself! We're OK. Whew! Huh? ARGH! Oh! - I'm so sorry! - That does it! I'm never working overtime again! Take this! If we don't get supernatural insurance, then I quit! I'd be better off selling hot dogs on the street! - Children? - Yeah, Mom. A rare natural phenomenon. Berg is recovering after a once-in-a-lifetime feather storm. Hello, Mom? Are you guys alright? Yeah, great! You can't imagine... All the feathers outside, unbelievable! Oh! Walk a little slower, why don't you? It's really quite lovely, and so strange. - It looks like winter. - That is strange. We started filming episode 15, 'Hot City in the Snowstorm', because... Oh! Everything's covered in feathers here too. Just the coincidence we needed! Yeah, a coincidence indeed. Now I understand what they say about fast food... being heavy. Let's move! The natural props are ready to go so you should be too! By all means, take your time! Oh! I've gotta run! We'll talk later. Lava, snowstorms - what will they have for us next? A tsunami? Popcorn lava, a snowstorm made of feathers. Just like on the show! So? So this must mean there's a Finn... Or someone... that's using the plot lines from the show to destroy the town! Yeah, of course, it's just what I thought! - That means someone... - Someone... who has access to the scripts in advance and drives a purple truck! Now we'll be able to find out what the next crime is! - And prevent it, of course! - Hey, hey! That's what I call deductive technique! I've cracked the case wide open! Ha-ha! Come on, Watson! Huh? Finnick, we have to go the other way. And where's that? The place where we can find the latest script to the show. Told ya! - Oh, am I a natural! - Huh. He's already been here. - Who? - That Finn, of course! Oh. This is it. Yeah. Uh-huh. - Uh-huh. - What's in there? Well, so far, it's just the Violet Villain rambling on and on. Then dancing and singing and juggling. Here he plays the bongos. Ah, right here! Mm-hm. So? What's it say? Is it awful? It says there's gonna be some kind of wheel or something that's gonna roll... Well, that's nothing! We can handle that. Oh! I mean, you can handle that. And there's no way this can threaten an entire town. I mean, how bad can a tiny wheel be? The Ferris wheel. This production is a nightmare on film street! I have to face a new sabotage every day! - Let's run! - What's going on here? Hey, look! All clear. Finnick, help me! - It's so dark in here. - Come on! There's got to be evidence in there! Oh, but I can't see a thing. Finnick? No-no-no-no-no-no! Oh. Oh, rats! Oh! Huh? Almost there. - Finnick? - Who's in there? And how did you end up in my truck? You're lucky I heard you, otherwise you'd be stuck for a while. What are you doing in there? Oh, come on, here, let me help you out. What? Did you see somebody? Oh. Yeah, the house needs a makeover. I know. Listen, I need to tell you something. It might sound a little crazy, but... I worked in film. Nothing seems crazy to me. What do I do now? Do I save Christine? The town? Or do I save myself? Ohhh! OK, but I swear this is the last time! So you're telling me that in every house there's some kind of invisible monster? No! Finns aren't monsters. Well, only yours is. I think his name is Muffinn. So he's the one who's been committing all these crimes, and the whole town is in danger? Yeah. And he goes by 'Invisible Terror'? Yeah. It's sort of a lame name. Ha! Nobody will ever believe this. Yeah, I know. That's because nobody can see them unless they have a piece of their fur. Huh? Oh! Oh. You mean like this? The Invisible Terror! It's not a lame name. We workshopped it for hours! So you two are the Invisible Terror? Yep! Um, I need to use the ladies room. I'm afraid we don't have a ladies room. And I'm afraid there's no escape. But why have you been committing all these crimes? Aren't you the nosy one? You guys are geniuses. How do you do it? Oh, now that question I like! Just like a real interview! A true artist needs to be able to share his process. No-one ever believed in me and my talent. Yeah, I used to be so lonely, and I dreamed about having a real friend! Not only that, but they used to mock me! And Finnick made fun of me and he provoked all the others to laugh at my human! That's so awful! Until the night that I lost it all! The night that my dream came true! You don't know a thing about how to play a villain! That takes an artistry you'll never have! I'd been watching fake villains in movies and on TV since I was a kid. And I never believed a single word they said. They made me sick. Nothing but frauds, all of them. But those who wouldn't let real talent shine were the worst villains of all. Huh? Huh. Hm! Hm. Huh! Hm. Ha! Hey there. Argh! Brrr! It was just a dream. - Argh! - How about a paw? Demon! What kind of demon are you?! It's OK. I'm your friend. I'm sorry... about your shirt. Do you think it can be fixed? - Yeah, not so much. - Oh. My human deserves to wear nothing but the very best! I knew then I wasn't alone anymore! Brrr! It was then that I knew. If people thought that I was no good as an actor and I could never make it as a convincing villain... then I would show them exactly what kind of evil supervillain I had inside! - This town is mine! - Oh! - Breathtaking! Genius! - Why, thank you. Huh? Where are you going? Um, but why this town? Oh! Oh, unfortunately, your time is up. I gotta run. Would you like to know what comes next? No spoilers here! Ha! Only in the movies does the villain confess his entire plan in act three. I already know. - You're using the wheel. - How'd you know that? Acting out the script from that TV show is obvious. But the script has been through several rewrites. You're gonna love the new Ferris wheel sequence. It'll be the 'roll' of a lifetime! Boo! That looks just like a... Yeah, like a costume made out of real Finn fur. Of course, we had to shear a few Finns to make this masterpiece. Yep, yep, had to. I almost didn't recognise them! Slimfinn. Frogfinn. After we shaved 'em, they went totally cuckoo. Just like JB always says, "Real art requires sacrifice!" Every day he seems more and more like a real Finn to me. Yeah, and in this get-up, I'm invisible! The fur makes me itch like crazy, I'm tellin' you, but as I always say, art requires sacrifice. Still whining about our fur, are we? Did you know that Finns are just wild about ice cream? Mm! What? Ohhh! - Hey, you, let my human go! - Finnick! Or else you'll see me go totally loco! Oh. Yeah, you let her go right now or else I'm... gonna get Finnicky! You're no match for me! I'm crazy strong! Give up now! I suppose I could always use a little more fur. Finnick! Didn't I mention that I used to be a member of the hunting club? Yep, I carried all the hunters' bags. Just let her go. She's totally bonkers! No-one's gonna believe her story. You've got no need for Finnick! His fur's gonna wreck your costume! My fur is fabulous! Get this lunatic out of here! Yeah, fabulous if you like fleas! Alas, we've run out of time, so I guess I'll have to shave the plump one on the way there. I am not plump, I am fluffy! Listen to me, you let her go! I'm the only one who gets to see Finns. Sorry, your fairytale had to end. Forever. You weren't really serious? But of course, I was deadly serious. But the houses, I mean, you wouldn't hurt them, right? You wouldn't just throw the Ferris wheel at the town? Well, of course not, silly! I'm gonna roll it at the town! - What? - This will be unforgettable! I can't wait to see my name in lights! All art requires sacrifice. When were you going to tell me about this? Um, how about now? But if you destroy all the homes, that means you'll also destroy all the Finns. Remember? Not every story has a happy ending and no-one's gonna suffer, I promise. We're villains, not animals! Let me outta here, you animals! I... have to save Finnick... and the town! It's good that my parents are actors 'cause it's taught me to take care of myself. It's locked. Right. If I were Sherlock Holmes, what would I do? Oh! Are you kidding me?! Were they having a sale on bars?! I refuse to let you do this! And I refuse to let you stop me! Whoa! Whoa! This time, my friend, art requires sacri-FUR! No! No! No! You stay here for now. And you, wiggle on over here. You're long overdue for a haircut. And now you're going to get it. Wait. Just wait. It's not that long. I'd rather have it cut by a professional. I know something you want. Come on. Dessert? Hey, you guys! Anyone want ice cream? Cool and yummy! Here they come! Right this way! Go get it! It worked! There's no telling just what Finns are capable of. Don't worry, I'll give you a trendy trim. You've got no beef with me. But I've got beef with you! Whoa! Arggh! Oh! No, no, no, no, no! Yeesh, I was only gonna give him a haircut. Whoa! I've been meaning to get that leak repaired. But perhaps it's best I didn't. Parting is such sweet sorrow. I wish I could stick around for the bonfire, but I never was one for barbecue. You have got to get out of here! Now, think like you're Christine. Uh... It's time to go now! So you're having a bad hair day. It'll grow. Too tight. Just one more inch. That's it. Gotta cut down on the doughnuts. - Hey, Muffinn! - Huh? Wanna lend a paw here? Hi! - Oh, what's wrong with you?! - Yay! Ah, well, at least you're still here, right? Huh? Huh? Arggh! So it wasn't the most graceful escape, but it works for me. Hey, you guys. My name is Christine. I'm Finnick's friend. I know that it's your, um, weekly meeting today and I know you're here. No! Please don't leave! Just hear me out! JB, the guy with Muffinn, he kidnaps Finns! He's shaving off all their hair and harming them. And there's more. JB caused all of Berg's disasters. Now he plans to crush the whole town with the Ferris wheel from the amusement park. Your town will be destroyed! Your houses will be ruined. Finns and your humans will be hurt! We have got to stop this! And we can if we act together! Together! Yeah, I know it's against all your rules to even talk to me. But Finnick broke the rules, and I've broken my rules to never get too comfortable in a new town and never make real friends. I'm guilty as charged! But JB has kidnapped Finnick! And Finnick is my best friend, who I don't want to lose! You know how special he is! Please help me. I can't do it alone. - Oh! - Mm. Mm. I think I need a hug! And to think I was gonna stay home. Time to join together! Sure, it's against our bylaws. We've vowed never to reveal ourselves. But now our way of life depends on that very thing! You broke the rules, and so can we. I trust you with this. Huh? Whoa! That JB is no match for us! We just have to seize his fur suit and get that bracelet, and we can leave the rest to the police! Let's teach this guy some manners! I just hope we make it! Whee! Huh! Today I'm the star. I was born to play the villain, no directors necessary. But as I always say, real art requires sacrifice. Hey, man, you got a problem with us? Excuse me? Excuse you! Oh! Ah! Oh! Mm! I need ice cream! Not now! Gotta go. This thing should have an elevator. Where do my tax dollars go?! Finally. It's nearly showtime! This moment calls for an evil laugh. Whew! Oh! Oh! Arggh! Ugh! Not you again! Well, if it isn't the Invisible Id-i-ot! My name is the Invisible Terror! Whoa. I should have shaved you when I had the chance! Give me that! - Let me go! - With pleasure! Huh? Oh! Now, stop trying to steal my scene! Huh? What? Again? I hate to break it to you, but you're the worst barber of all time! Ow! Take this! Take that! Now stay there. Huh! The lighter! You looking for this? Look up there, it's a fire! - Whoa! - Yeah, why not? I'm commandeering your binoculars. Huh? This might be the first time in a hundred years Berg has a criminal! Somebody call the police! Wait a minute, I am the police! Look at what you've done! Alright, let's have it your way! The audience deserves to see me in full costume! Here comes the really fun part! Whoo! Oh! You've got a front row seat, don't you? Arggh! Ugh. We're too late! Finnick? Finnick! Wah... At least now we can skip the Zipper. Enjoy the show! Plus the sequel next season. The national tour! Oh! Eugh. Come on! Huh? Arggh! Oh! Where do you think you're going? Christine? What are you doing here? Just exploring the town. Ohhh! My house will be the first to go! It's the only home I've known. Nope! That is not going to happen. Now, what are you waiting for? Move it, already! What, are you blind? Can't you see my blinker? We haven't got all day here! Get out of my way! - We'll never make it! - Oh, yes, we will! Everybody... hang onto your fur! What in the world? Push like the wind! Like you're Finns! This was not in the script! Wha... Huh? You can't stop me! Oh, gross! You've got to keep piling them up! Right there! To the right! The right! Arggh! That was a close one! To the left! Go left! - They said left! - All together! Go, go, go! Let's do this together! I can hold it off... Whoa! Where'd it go? Whoa! Whoa! Ha-ha! Hit the road, wheel! This Finn is on a roll! - You actually did it, partner! - Was there ever any doubt? - Well, maybe just a little. - Hang on, I'm coming. I'm running! Or rather, I'm falling! Whoa! OK, so now what's the plan? I haven't exactly figured that out yet! Alright, are we all set? Wait! Where are my new actors? - Present! - Then get on my set! - Yes, sir! Here we come! - Oh, wow! Happily! Oh. What is that? Mom, Dad! What's up? - Christine! - It's Christine! Nobody told me about the new prop, did they? I don't know. But I'll add it to the props list! Christine! What are you doing in there? Just hanging out. - What? - Right. This calls for stunt 85. - We're coming, sweetie! - Everything will be fine. Don't worry. Time for stunt one-oh... Oh! This one never works! Whoa! - Christine, don't let go! - I've got you! And I've got you! And I've got all of you! I knew the circus training would come in handy! What a shot! I got it! - We all intact? - Nearly. My baby, you're safe and sound with us! We love you so much, Christine! And I love you, all of you. Technology is a curse! I had the thing in video mode so why didn't it record?! Tell me somebody got that! Eh. Citizens of Berg! Please keep calm! The situation is under control. Why didn't I just go to Hollywood? They know real talent when they see it. Scram! And stay there! Huh? You'll never understand what real art is. Actually, I'm a film buff. Ah! He had time to put on a bracelet but not pants? They'll talk about my performance for years! A villain for the ages! Might I get some heat back here? My feet are freezing. Ah, well, I guess that's over now. Uh-huh, that's a wrap. Now we can go our separate ways and just get back to our lives. Yeah, we can. And I guess that I won't see you from now on. Deal's a deal. I intend to keep my promise. What am I supposed to do with that? As if that could ever be my fur. JB took your fur from me and so I thought I'd... Rob an old Finn of the only fur he's got left? Bleugh. Plus that colour washes you out. Huh. This'll look better on you. Be careful with it. It took me all day to braid. Give the other one back to Grandpops. He needs all the fur he can get. - OK, moving on. - Does this mean... that I could be... like, your favourite human or something? Well, obviously. Duh! My B... FF! Best Finn Forever!
