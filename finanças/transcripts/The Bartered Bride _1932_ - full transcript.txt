I don't care if the ladies and gentlemen are staying, but I'm leaving this minute. Very well. But it's too late now, Privy Councilor, it'll be night soon. - Night? - Yes, night. No, that mustn't happen. Then pick me up at the Golden Goose tomorrow morning. Ladies, for your foppish addiction to silly pleasures I couldn't possibly keep Rothschild waiting in Vienna. Enjoy yourselves, ladies. See you later, old boy. "Bon Voyage" ... and don't look for me you won't find me anyway. I'm staying at Aunt Leni's in Prague. "Circus Heinrich Brummer" - Do it for my sake. - Till Pilsen, no problem. But only tomorrow morning, and it won't be easy to convince the Privy Councilor. But for your sake ... For my sake? That is true love That is true love Herr Von Broschek stabbed himself beneath a Linden tree Lisa died at sunrise together with her child. Loyal John buried them in unhallowed ground. And both their graves were trampled by wild horses. Were trampled by wild horses. That is true love. That is true love. And when spring returned, at their graves he saw wondrous flowers sprouting and white doves hovering above. The Heavens themselves are forgiving when two love each other truly. And all this happened at harvest time, in the year 107. In the year 107. That is true love. That is true love. "Don't feed: very wild, very snappish, very valuable" Engagement cake. That is true love. That is true love. Do you want to listen to this a fourth time? No. Thank you. They already know it by heart. Ladies and gentlemen, let this be a nice souvenir for you. The mirror image on paper. The amusement for the really distinguished society. Please step inside. ... for the really distinguished society of Paris, Vienna and Berlin. This isn't a drawing. This is pho-to-graphy! This is progress! This is a miracle! Ladies and gentlemen, let this be a nice souvenir for you. Ladies and gentlemen, let this be a nice souvenir for you. The mirror image on paper. The amusement for the really distinguished society of Paris, Vienna and Berlin. This isn't a drawing. This is pho-to-graphy! Pho-to-graphy! This is no trick. Pho-to-graphy! This isn't magic, this is progress! This is science! Hold it. Smile. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 27, 28, 29, 30 Halt! I thank you, sir, and I hope it'll be a nice souvenir for you. You can bet on it! Art is beautiful. But it's a lot of work too. Yes. I'd like to see the circus director, please. - What is it about? - Police regulations. I see. You! Come down here. Come down. - There's someone to see you. - What is it this time? Come down. What do you mean, "this time"? Nothing's happened yet today. It's about some police regulations. We have enough police regulations already. No, it's about the police concession. - But we already have that too. - Come down there. Are you Heinrich Brummer? That's me, but we already have the concession. I know, but I must make a few more notes. How many persons do you employ in your company? Well, in total they're ... Seven persons, almost eight. Almost eight persons. What do you mean, almost eight? It's either seven or eight. They're definitely not eight. - Seven then. - No, five. Five persons. Note: five. - Five pieces of persons. - Five pieces. Five persons then. Male or female? Not "or". "and" female. How many? Our employees are perfectly willing to let themselves be counted. How many persons does your circus consist of? When the business is bad, very few. - And when the business is good? - Also very few, but a bit more. About 300, 210 290 ... 290 In the range of ... I don't know exactly. - Let's say 300. - No, that's too much. At 300 we'd be overcrowded. You know, write down 298. 298. 297, 298, something like that. Then I have one more important question. You still owe the municipality 300 Guldens for your last performance. - Do you remember? - I remember, I haven't forgotten. - But you still haven't paid. - That I forgot. Will you finally pay those outstanding 300 Guldens? Of course I will, if I don't forget it. I'll remind him not to forget. Yes? The gentleman is a lover of the Arts. What does he love? The Arts. The Arts? Is that so? They you can buy two tickets for tonight's performance. Two tickets. 2 x 2.50 makes 5 Guldens. In total. Five. - Here you are. - Thank you. Do stay. Do stay, by all means. You don't bother us at all. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. He seems to be a real gentleman. A pity he isn't an artist. Why? When somebody has money and isn't an artist, that's the same as as something else. And when an artist has money, or hasn't money, or let's say, he's an artist and he has no money, or he's an artist after all, what ... if you know what I mean, if he were an artist, and if he had money, or wanted to have money, but everyone wants that I mean, if he ... The smart thing would be if someone were an artist and had plenty of money, of course. That's what I mean. Pardon me, Constable, have you seen the Mayor's daughter? Not that I know. I keep him in office with my taxes, and he's rude! At this very moment the noble dice of destiny have been cast. While from this hill the great Corsican directs the battle, surrounded the generals of his staff, darkness descends upon the battlefield. Evening approaches the Wooded City. Large parts of the outskirts are already on fire, as can be seen in this model. Thus, ladies and gentlemen, in seldom-seen vivid clarity a piece of world-history realistically assembled. If you have enjoyed this, you may show your gratitude with a small contribution. I hope the lady and the gentleman weren't bothered too much with my lecture. The persons you have summoned are here. Thank you. "audience room" My child has left me, my child is gone, this wedding can't take place. My child shall act according to her own free will. Do you know who is your child's free will? It's the mail-coachman. And she's running around with her free will, among the stalls of the fair. They even had their photograph taken together. Silence! My child's too precious for yours with her "free will". Too precious? Do you know where your child is right now? I beg your pardon! I just saw him in the circus, with a dancer. A dancer whose legs were naked. - Really? - Your son! ... and the welfare or your families, your children. If you don't want to have a coachman as your son-in-law, Mayor, and you no dancer as daughter-in-law, then you must give me free reign. Only a good honest wedding will help. Come in. The pressing matter of the performance concession, requested by Heinrich Brummer for his Wandering Circus, file 31B/712, 1855, concerning the deferral of municipal debts for the taxation of public festivities, to the amount of 300 Guldens. Mayor, think about the children, Mayor. Refused. ??? Now we're blissfully united, in sorrow and joy ??? let us drift through life like two swallows ??? We have sworn love to each other, we have pledged our word for ever ??? Faithful love cannot be marred by any former pledge or promise. ??? we shall remain faithful to each other. Not approved by the Mayor. Refused. "He who cuts up this canvas and is caught during the act, will be prosecuted" So. What's the matter with you? We have to leave, we're not allowed to perform. What a pity. Listen. Listen to me. I'll get you the 300 Guldens, so that you can perform, I promise, till tonight. Coachman, how about a drink? No thank you, Privy Councilor. Excuse me, Stage-Coachman, have you seen my two pupils? Madame, let the girls have some fun at the fair today. What a charmer you are. I'll make sure that you can perform. Here's some money. Go over to the tavern and wait for me there. - But I ... - You're one of my friends. - Are you my friend? - Yes. See you later. Friend. Good evening. Good evening, Papa. Mama, I have a favour to ask of you. Could you give me, for a special purpose, 300 Guldens? 300 Guldens? - Because you know, the 300 Guldens... - Straight to bed! Children must obey, you'll stay in your room. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Well? Kiss! Good night, father. - Good night, mother. - Sweet dreams. If at least he could ... If at least he could do a handstand. But he's still young. My new friend is paying for everything. Can I see the Goldsmith? "Heinrich Langer, jeweler" Father plays the second trumpet tonight. - I wanted to buy something. - Then he'll come of course. Virgin Marie, all must happen according to your will. I only humbly hope that I will see him again. I'm going to bed, and where are you? I'm going to bed. And where are you? A few hours ago we were a couple. Now you've disappeared. Now I am alone. I promise I'll come, then we'll be united I promise I'll come, then you'll be mine I am bound to you, soon I'll be yours. I am bound to you, today I'll be yours. The hour of bliss has come now that now you're mine. now you're mine. When you leave I don't want to dolefully carry your ring with me carry your ring with me. When you come back I won't question you, I simply want to say that you are here. I simply want to say that you are here. When you leave I don't want to dolefully carry your ring with me dolefully carry your ring with me dolefully carry your ring with me dolefully carry your ring with me Think about it a bit more, little Marie. Wenzel owns the biggest estate in the county. And Hans? You love Hans. But perhaps you won't love him by tomorrow. Whereas tomorrow, Wenzel will still own the biggest estate in the county. Your mother has passed away, she might have found better words with you. We'll have to wait a bit more, Micha, try and see whether the children will get along after all. Wait a minute, coachman. Coachman. Coachman, I must speak to you. - Why? - Because of last night's business. Be sensible! We can leave straight away. You can't do this! The Mayor's daughter! Honestly spoken, man to man nothing will come of it. You are nothing, you own nothing, it'll be a disaster. What's going on? - Can we leave now? - But he just told you, you can leave straight away. I'm in a hurry, I must be in Vienna in three days. I'll offer you a deal, young man. You leave town, renounce your marriage with Marie, and I'll pay you 100 Guldens on the spot and everything's as good as ... as done. Ready. 140, give me your word, 160 ... 170 180 and everything's settled 200. Without ducats you're in a spot in a tight spot Without ducats he's in a spot, in a tight spot Who has no money, no land and no grub to feed on Who has no money, no land and no grub to feed on Take my advice, take the ducats, take ducats Take my advice, save your ducats, save ducats For the money you'll get woods, meadows, fields and seeds. Don't need any woods, meadows, fields and seeds. A home and a garden, all sorts of cattle, servants and horses, a coach and carriage chicken and pigeons, apples and grapes, beer and wine, bulls and pigs basins, jugs and tankards, a chest filled with clothes and shoes A home and a garden, all sorts of cattle, servants and horses, a coach and carriage Leave me in peace! Leave me alone! I don't want any clothes, nor shoes nor a woman. That puts a man to shame. Money should never be refused. Listen to me, you fool. Anybody else would feel fortunate. I admit you're right, but I say no. I admit you're right, but I say no. I admit you're right, but I say no. I admit you're right, but I say no. Anybody else would feel fortunate. But I say no! "To Pilsen" - Please take me with you. - This is against regulations. I must go to Pilsen, it's very important. I must go to Pilsen. My happiness depends on it. If you don't take me, all is lost. Alright then, get up. "Extra-mail-coach Dresden-Pilsen-Prague" This might lose me my position. No way! I have to go to the district offices in Pilsen. The Mayor won't let the circus perform. I'll do my utmost because I love Esmeralda. And if the circus must leave I shall never see her again. Marie, the Mayor's daughter? Marie's her name, the Mayor's daughter. That's her. But ... But I don't want her. I love Esmeralda. Yes. - I'll find the 300 Guldens for you. - Really? - You drive the coach in my place. - Alright. You can count on me. I'll accept your offer. For 300 Guldens. Yes, but ... - 200. - I need 300. - So we'll make a deal? - No, 300, not a penny more, not a penny less. You'll never again try to keep Marie from marrying Wenzel? For 300 Guldens? No I won't. Your word? Your money? Quiet, quiet. Patience. I've taken care of everything. He's left town for a meagre 300 Guldens. Quiet, quiet, I can't hear a thing. Believe me, I can swear on it. Hans has bartered Marie for money. Believe me, I heard it, Hans has bartered Marie for money. Believe me, I can swear on it. Hans has bartered Marie for money. What's the news? Will he renounce Marie? Yes, and you only owe me 300 Guldens for it. I can't understand what has happened here. No, what's happened now. Everybody's saying it. He bartered his bride. He bartered his bride. I heard it myself, my wife was really indignant. I can only confide this in you. I myself heard it from the charwomen. they say the Mayor's pretty Marie has been bartered. ??? what a scandal! what a shame! ??? unheard of in our tavern ??? I smoke my pipe on it I knew it. A man who has bartered you. And you wanted to love him. And you wanted to marry him. We can't show our face anymore. The whole town's talking about it. He's bartered her. He's bartered her. He's bartered her. He's bartered her. His bride, his bride He's bartered his bride. He's bartered his bride. He's bartered his bride. He's bartered his bride. He's bartered her. Bartered.

You may go in. - What is it? - Take off your hat. Mayor, we're overjoyed to finally make your acquaintance. Very overjoyed, Mr. Mayor. What is it about? Our outstanding municipal dues. The astronomical sum of 300 Guldens. I'm very sorry, but ... - But Mayor! - You were notified yesterday, weren't you?

Please don't say anything, Mayor. - But he doesn't say anything. - But he could have. - But he said nothing. - Never mind. Mayor, believe me, True Art creates a bond. True Art reconciles, Mayor.

At the end of her performance, Esmeralda will stick her head into the jaws of the brown beast. The jaws of the brown beast.
