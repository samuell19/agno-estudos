For the orphanage? No way that l'm doing it. Count me out. He's cute but mean. This will be over tomorrow. - l know you like it. - You are broken. - Well, l'm rich. - ls that so? What happened?

A teacher's ability is a belief that he can change people. By Ralph Emerson. l know l won't change. No big deal. You wanna take a shortcut? No, you do it fair and square. Even if it takes longer! Okay? That temper must run in the family. You left way too early. Honey! Jae-kyung!

That tramp is a work of plastic surgery. - Are you trying to punk us? - What a place, man. - Hi, what can l get you? - Get us whatever you want. You guys are so cool. What are you doing in these boondocks? We were worried. - Are you senile? - What? Don't ask any questions. Forgot that? God, l can't believe this. Honey, are we drinking here? l don't want to. lf you honey me again l'll make you work here. Buy one for me, too. lt's launching, not lunch. l gotta have it before everybody else does. Why ask abut Jae-kyung? He's my man! What the... l'll call you back. Shit! Which one? Can you pop the lid? Let me help you. lt's so heavy. lt's $35 including the delivery. Here. Keep the change. Ours is the only station in town. Come get gas for the rest of the change. This is all l have on me. Why always you? You know her? Wait. Where are you going? l tipped you for some service. Empty the ashtray. You smoked. You empty it. What are you doing? Get out of here.

Feel better now? l'm making potato balls. Why staring at me like that? - Never seen it before. - What? A girl cooking. lt's boiling over. You like it? l have a question. ls there a way to graduate without doing the play? - No. - Make one then. You don't wanna do it to help the orphanage? l don't. l've helped enough, but... Forget it.

Hey, it's a market day! Please! - Don't you have to buy props? - l don't know. lsn't that Jae-kyung? lt's something, huh? Never seen this in Seoul? We have TVs in Seoul. Look at that! Must be a new stock! Buy some. They're top quality. Yeah? All she has is fake stuff. Oh, you bought it from me. That's good. lt's the same as mine. - You know how much this is? - Of course. $10 for 3. That's what you paid. You said to buy us lunch. Can you buy me this instead? - You sure? - Yes. Me too! l know you're loaded. l want lunch! Lunch! - Here. - Nice! - Buy yourself lunch. - You're so beautiful. You're cool! lt's a weird town. A ten-dollar-bill can make everybody so happy. Did you make these? lf not me, did you? l know you're faking it. Get out of the hospital. Your leg is fine. What's wrong with you? You couldn't send me a message if you were okay or not. How could you collapse from overwork? Quit working at the station. They're nice. Don't be mistaken. l didn't weave them. Pretty. You could've thanked me. - You'll quit working, right? - l don't know. l'll see. Hi. Choppy Chop! Hey. Pull in and up. What is this, a circus? Why can't we just do the lines? Hey! Put me down! What are you doing? Let go! Hey! Why! Hold on. Wait. l'll do it. l'll do it, okay? - Lift them. - Why! One, two, three! Breathe, Breathe. - One more time. - One more time. Stop it. Please, don't! One, two, three! You're supposed to pick them not eat them! The sun's going down soon. You're awfully slow. Pick it up, will you? Why should l do this? Staging the play is no joke. lt costs a lot. Get the principal! This is exploitation of labor. l'll report him to the police! Shut up and work. We need to get paid. Shut up! l'm not eating it. Here, l picked it. l can't believe him. Thanks. All right! Thanks. This is it? $30 is more than enough for what you did. What, $30? l'm KANG Jae-kyung. ln my account, l have... So what? lt's not your money, is it? You have a long way to go. Listen to yourself. You don't even have $3 on you. You're pathetic. l don't care who you are. Get real! That pretty? - What? - You can't take your eyes off my face. l wasn't looking at you because you're pretty. Your hair smells like shit. l can't even breathe. That pretty? - What? - You can't take your eyes off my face. l wasn't looking at you because you're pretty. Your hair smells like shit. l can't even breathe. - Be careful driving home. - Okay. See you later. Not going home? What are you doing here? l'm the head of this orphanage. What? You shouldn't be out for long. Dad, don't be a nag. Come in. Eat with us. Dad? lt's okay. l know how you feel. - How do l feel? - You're sorry for me. They feel sorry when they learn that l'm an orphan. Thanks for taking me home. Hey! l don't feel sorry for you. l don't have parents, either. My daddy is getting married. - To whom? - Mrs. Shredder. - You sure? - Of course. Daddy said so earlier. Look. No dialect, okay? Let's take a break. We can't. Eun-whan will be upset. We should practice songs, too. Songs? All right. Let the start at the very begining Your pronunciation sucks! No, it doesn't. You try it then. You're a big boy but act like a baby. Where's Eun-whan anyway? Must be working. You know she's into money. l feel sorry for her. She works after school cooks, and cleans for us. Why don't you get a job, too and help her out then? lf you're done... What? Why can't l go in? Only the family is allowed! - Behave! - Get out of my way! Calm down. What are you doing? lt's hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. And her heart is very unstable. lt can kill her any moment. You said it was due to overworking when she was here before. l didn't expect it to get worse this fast. l don't believe you. Do it again. Do all the tests over. You call yourself a doctor? You're only a quack! What are you doing here? You woke up? You're drooling. What man would marry you? What are you doing here? - On behalf of flowers. - What? l wanted to get flowers but they said no. So here l am. Am l not pretty? l smell pretty good, too. - You know what's wrong with me? - Yes, anemia. The doc says you'll be fine if you eat well. So, you'd better eat well. This is nice. Let her live. Let my Eun-whan live. Please. l'm rich. Try everything. l'll pay. What about a transplant? lt's too late. Come on, Eun-whan is... She's only 19. l haven't even told her that l like her. She can't afford to be upset or surprised. And love can kill her. lf she gets too happy or excited her heart could stop. No. No way. That's bullshit! Not again! l can't believe this. My son says that he doesn't know you. Whatever you're trying to pull forget it. l... What, you need money? For an abortion? l live from hand to mouth. Why don't you... Recognize me. We have the same eyes. And same lips. l could tell. l hadn't seen you for 19 years but l recognized you. How could you not? Oh God... l hated you so much. Growing up without you l thought l'd make you pay. l thought l'd hurt you and make you sorry. But l ended up hurting myself. My baby... l'll forgive you for dumping me. Forgive me for hating you. Because l... l'd like to go to heaven. You ran from the hospital. You're so bad. - Should l go back to the hospital? - Forget it, l... What about you? You have no idea. Why would l not know? l like you so much. You made me worry to death. Right? You missed one. l'd like to keep you by my side all day. Can't you stop working? No, l have to make money. l'm putting aside money. What for? To get married? - l wanna buy a house. - A house? There's this house with many windows. Very pretty. l'd be so happy living in a house like that. Don't worry about it. l'll buy you a better house. l'm talking about the house where l live now. l always imagine that. Why don't you quit working and imagine? - lmagining doesn't cost anything. - Yes, it does. The land owner wants us out. Are you a lawyer, or a swindler? What are you doing here? Eunhye Orphanage! lt's grandpa's land. You told them to move out didn't you? Your grandpa is dead. So l guess l did. Son of a bitch! They've occupied that land illegally. And they've never paid rent while your grandfather was alive. lt's mine in a few months. You think you'll get away with this? Who knows what could happen? You're graduating in 5 months. What the hell! There's a way. What's that? Give up the inheritance. How can you do this to me? No. How can you do this to my grandfather? lf you do, you'll receive 0.1% of the inheritance in cash. Some people will be happy to get you out of the way. lf you wanna buy that land with that money. l'll be happy to help you. Tired? l told you not to do it. No, l'm not tired. - Did you and Jae-kyung fight? - No, it's the opposite. l'm so happy. l'm so happy that l think l'm going to hell. What are you talking about? l'll end up hurting him. Knowing that, l miss him. l wanna hold his hands. And be with him. What makes me happy now will hurt him later. But l can't help it. l'll definitely go to hell. ls God blind? Doesn't he have a conscience? Dad! Don't be afraid to be happy. He's taking you from me. He'll understand. Give me her medicine. l'll keep her by my side and take care of her. Here's the money. - But she's... - l know. Either happiness or sadness will kill her. She might die any moment. That is why. Why won't you listen? You're the risk to her. You can't do this just to make yourself happy. lt's not for my own sake. How happy could l be with a dying girl? But even if l stay away she will die. What if she leaves when l'm not there? Give me her medicine. l've been waiting for you. l've come to live with you. Your dad is waiting. Go. l got his permission. He trusts me. He told me to have fun. Are you nuts? You want to move in with me? l'm hungry. Let's eat. Get out of here. l don't wanna be with you. You said that you liked me and you wanted to be with me. l was caught up in the moment. Jerk! ls it that easy for you? Love is that easy? Damn! You got a hearing problem? Didn't you hear me? Get out of here! You give me a big headache. My head is about to explode. l must've been blinded stuck out here. l'm not here to date. So leave before l make you! How much is 0.1%? lsn't this too early to talk? How much do l get if l give up my inheritance? Are you? - A verbal agreement is also... - l know. How much is it? lt's a little shy of what costs to buy the orphanage. Leave the orphanage alone. l'll give it up. l won't eat my words. Get the paper work done. That's your specialty. Are you sure you won't regret it? Won't l regret it? l know l will, after this call. Bye. l'll regret it for the rest of my life. But this girl is more important than 99.9% of my inheritance that l'm throwing away. Hi. What's wrong with your face? Hey. Hey, stop running around. Let's practice. - Where's Eun-whan? - Eun-whan? She was in a bad mood. She went out for a stroll. Let's do a new scene. l'll come back. Don't go. l'll be back after 10 nights. l promise. You mean it? - Who wrote this? - Yes Eun-whan adapted it from a book. Please, come back. This isn't any good. Gather around. Try to bring up more emotions. - l'll come back, Eun-whan. - Don't go. l'll be back after 10 nights. l promise. - You mean it? - Yes. Mom! Mom! - Where's Eun-whan? - She didn't show up. Eun-whan. l... l came back too late. l don't care anymore. You don't have to do the play. l'll come back. Eun-whan. 10 nights. After 10 nights. Jae-kyung. l meant it when l said 10 nights. But that day... l lost my parents. So l couldn't. l didn't want to. l erased all the memories about you and this place. lt was too painful. l'm sorry. Time's running out on us. l came back too late. l hope to stay with you until the first snow. So l can wear those socks that you bought me. But l will die before that, because of you. l know it hurts for you to be with me. But l love you. Look at me. You like the room? - No. - Why not? l thought we'd share the room. l'm going home. lf you're kidding, l'll kill... The pillow is too high. l don't like it. How about now? lt's better. ls your head made of stone? lt's so heavy. My arm hurts. lt's just the beginning. lt'll hurt more later. You'll hurt more than me. l wish. l wish l'd hurt for you. Won't you regret it? l get that a lot lately. Okay, we'll see. Let me sleep some. Your arm will go to sleep. l didn't think you'd let me do this. Trying to seek out a favor? Not with you, with God. So he'll take his time taking you from me. - lf anybody sees this... - They'll call me a sissy? l don't care. Not embarrassed? This will bring me love. Why would l be? Dye my toenails, too. - Why didn't you tell me? - What? Why didn't you tell me that it was you? How could l? You didn't recognize me. Hi, l'm Eun-whan. How have you been? l'm here to say goodbye. See? Hold on a sec! - Remember this? - You told me. lf you blow it, your wish will come true. You do remember. What are you wishing for? For you to grow up. Don't take me suddenly. Give me enough time to say goodbye. lt's done. l can't believe l'm doing this. Delete it! So cute. Don't! Move your hands. What are you doing? - What the... - Just one picture. Come on, you look so pretty. Just one picture. Stop! Just one picture 1, 2, 3! Where's the maid? Wait and see. Colonel has the baton. The nun is fine. Our kids look great. Don't push me! So does the maid. l said l didn't wanna do this! Your fingernails! - Won't you cut it up? - No, Colonel. Anything else you need? - That maid has an attitude. - Tell me about it. You're supposed to cut it up for him. - Shove it in your mouth. - Not too much adlib. - What's adlib? - Come on! Don't know? His head is good for nothing. You alright? Hey! Why sit there? That's for the teacher. l take better pictures when l'm seated. Seated or standing it's the same you. Get up. Okay, let's take it. You wanted me next to you, didn't you? Shut up. Look here. Stand closer. Here we go. Cheese! Eun-whan, what's wrong? Are you in pain? l'm fine. l'm just taking a shower. Open the door. Open it. Or l'll break it. Open it now. Leave me alone. l'll break it, okay? Eun-whan! Eun-whan! Eun-whan, stay with me. Fool. lf it hurts, scream. Hold me and cry. Don't try to hide it. lt hurts me so much. l feel as if l'd die before you! l'm scared, Jae-kyung. l'm so scared. Let me live. How... How could l... My heart... lt's broken. Because l love you enough for my heart to burn. Medicine doesn't work anymore. lt's hot. So hot. How... Eun-whan, please. Eun-whan! Eun-whan! - Keep them closed. - Okay. Open them. lt's for your birthday. l couldn't wait. You made all these? Sure. l'm such a family man. Here. - What's this? - A birthday present. Don't be sick anymore. That cures everything. Everybody in Seoul knows it. One a day, okay? Don't overdose it. Sorry. Excuse me. Wondering why l like you l miss you. lt's a disease. lt's raining.
