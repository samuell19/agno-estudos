The trees turned green, and in the meadows the young grass came up. [chicks peeping ] What do you think about the babies? They are just adorable! [Birds singing] Why doesn't the biggest break yet? It must be a turkey egg. It looks exactly the same as I had once. And I had a lot of trouble with these turkeys! The did not want to go into the water! So I grunted and grunted - Yeah, but they did not go! I'm sure, I'm sure that it will be an extraordinary child! [Tick] [Tick] How nice! It's all light! Oh, what a wonderful world! Yes, indeed, extraordinary! He's ugly! [Laughs] He is not like the others! Phew, what a big one! Ugly! Ugly! The next day the young mother went with her chicks to the poultry yard. They should be introduced into society. [Music] [Music] What a piece of poultry! Look how nice he is rowing with his legs! He is ugly, but he has a good heart! In the poultry yard lived a fat Spanish duck. She was considered the highest in rank. Now I will introduce you to the Spanish duck. You see - she has blue rag on her paw! That is - a sign of rank! Bow to her and say: "Crack! Crack!" Well, here's a whole crowd! So many ducklings already, and now even more. [Laughs] But that last one! How hideous he is! It is! we can't tolerate such hideousness! [Sound of a fight] I think this is yours. What? [Cackles] What an insolence! [Cackles] Who let this freak in? [Beeping] [Beeping] [Beeping] Nice kids you got. Really very nice! Hello, Grandma! This is - my youngest. He spent too long in the egg and therefore not entirely as he should be. [Quietly] Crack! Say: "Crack". [Shouts] This one is indeed a failure! Some queer poult! Thus passed the first day. And it got even worse! All made fun of the unhappy duckling and no duck recognized him as one of theirs. What kind of bird is this! I'm a duck! Ha, what kind of duck are you? You're a queer poult! Piss off to the turkeys! You wouldn't have a place for me? Everyone tells, I am a sort of turkey. What? What do you say? [Shouts] How dare you, you freak! I'll show him! [Shouts] Please, take me! I was just born yesterday, and still do not know what I am. What you are? What you are? what you are? I wouldn't want you to intermarry with us! [Shouts] Beat it! [Cackles] [Cries of birds] [Rooster cackles] So the poor duckling wandered around in search of refuge. He could not understand Why to the bird that lived in the yard he looked so ugly, why they all laughed at him and chased him. [Solemn music] The duckling did not know the name of these beautiful birds, but he admired them so as he did not admire anyone else. Oh, how he wanted to fly away with them! Oh, why I was not born so beautiful? [Sound of the wind] [Thunder] [Rain] [Thunder] [Thunder] [Cackles] What is that ugly one doing here? I. .. I ... I ... Please let me stay with you. I can be useful. I won't be a bother. Well, do you know how to take care of eggs? No. Maybe you know how to purr? Like this! [Humming] I Do not know how to do that. Well maybe you know how to make sparks? Like this. Oh ... No. So go, if you don't know how to do anything! [Fast Music] Meow! [Fast Music] Again the duckling was left on his own. [Laughs] [Laughs] [Frog laugh] Even they laugh at me. Here in the cavern on the shore of the Forest Lake , the poor duckling settled himself. He was very bored on his own but he was afraid to look others in the eye. And only at night, when no one could see him, He crawled out to swim, fly and spread their wings. But when the morning came, the duckling would always withdraw in his cave. And so the summer passed. During this time the duckling grew stronger, but he couldn't bear his loneliness. Autumn came. The days grew colder and colder. The birds that lived on the lake started to fly away to warmer places. With anguish he watched them go. He felt very bad. And then, one frosty morning, He saw those lovely birds again. They were preparing for a long journey. It really seems You can freeze to death here! Better to try and join these majestic birds than to die here from the cold! Oh! The ugly duckling never had dreamed of such a joy! The beautiful swans took him into their family! He was incredibly happy, because he met real friends. [Happy music] How handsome he is! He came to say hello to me! After all, we are related to swans. But no one in the poultry yard realised that this beautiful bird flying over them was their former Ugly Duckling. THE END Subs by Eus after the Russian sub for hearing impaired
