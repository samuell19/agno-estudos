Grandma always said I was a good kid. She likes to tell the story about me. She calls it the pickle jar story. When I was eight years old I spent hours in my backyard in East LA. Catching fireflies in a pickle jar. Kept the jar in my bedroom and... it lit up the wall. It was beautiful. But I felt sorry for the fireflies. Fuck you I'd poke holes in the top of the jar but I knew that wasn't enough. The fireflies would be dead in the morning if I didn't do something. So I went over and unscrewed the jar and let them loose. Dozens of fireflies filled our little house. Grandma found out but... ...she wasn't mad. She said I had something that was very special. She prayed I'd never lose it. My tender heart. The chainsaw? Fool, why you using chainsaw? Yeah, I mean that's the way they wanted it. They want the head of the head guy. The head of the head guy? Seven prime time gangster motherfuckers and that decapitation... Boy, they better be paying you big time for this. I'm getting the fuck out of this business. Trading this Hyundai in for a Tesla or some shit. I thought you had a Honda. Hyundai motherfucker, Hyundai. What you gonna do if you ain't a hitman? You gonna miss it. Be a chef. You don't know how to fucking cook. I know how to cook enough. What are you trying to be? Fucking Chef Gordon Ramsey? Chef Khali. Come here, Papi. What's good, homie? What you looking at? I see what you're trying to do here. You're trying to win Cori back. I ain't trying to win nobody back. Not Cori. If you a cook, you need to bake me a pie, motherfucker. Or some pastries. Some shit. - Ah, buenos dias, Chiquillo! - Chiquillo? You haven't called me that since I was a kid. Bueno. What you thought I forgot? Huh? I remember you as a little baby climbing onto the crib. And hanging onto the bars like a little monkey. I made you some coffee. Thank you. Smells good. Have you been taking your medicine? I know what you want to do. You want to put me in one of those senior places. - Yet I'm not going in there... - I was just asking. Listen. That place smells and reeks of piss. Hmm? You can take me out in the street and shoot me! - Wa... Wa... Wait... - I am not going there! I'm not taking you to no Senior Care Living. Okay? If I was to take you any place... it'd be like that fancy place up in Malibu. Oh... Baby... you can't afford it. Don't you worry about it, all right? I'm gonna take care of you. Cuidate. On my way home I played it safe. Took the white bread express. Avoiding cops. And sticking to the whitest neighborhoods in Los Angeles county. No, thank you. I'm good. I'm good, man. These fucking white boys act like they own the shit, man. I'm cool. Would you like to make a donation - to the Westside children fund? - No, I'm cool. Come on, man. You know you pay for a cup of coffee, you can feed a hungry child for life? Look man, play time's over. What don't you get the fuck up out of here. This is just my luck. After avoiding pimps, prostitutes and gang bangers... I get jacked by Justin fucking Bieber. Okay. I'm gonna get out of the car, okay? Shit. Go get him. Go tell him to stop. - Do something. - Hey, just chill, all right? I'm gonna get up out of the car. Yo, Tyler put it down. Tyler, are you insane? Put the gun away, you're gonna get us all in trouble. Yo, Tyler, put it down. - Put the gun away! - Get out of the car. I'm going to give you my wallet. Okay. Stop! - Everybody in the car! - Is he okay? Everybody in the car now! Tyler, why are we... Let's go! Go! Where we at? Doctor John didn't pick up. So, I had to find a Plan B. Hi, I'm George. This is my daughter's room. Her name's Cali. Kind of like yours. My name's Khali. It's Nahuatl. George here is a nurse. I was a medic in Iraq. Um, but now I work at L.A. County. You're lucky. That was almost your heart. - Who the fuck is this? - Hey uh, I'm Isaac. - Or Zeke. People call me Zeke. - No one calls you Zeke. In grade school, people called me Zeke. I've known you since kindergarten. No one ever called you anything but Isaac. Fuck man. What's up fool? What's wrong? I think he's septic. George, he's septic. - He's not septic. - Fuck. You don't even know what the fuck that means. No, listen, he's sep... What the fuck are you guys talking about? Fuck! - Are you okay, bro? - Fucking... My fucking car is gone. - Who cares, fool, it's a Honda. - Hyundai! It's a Hyundai, motherfucker! Those Hyundais have great warranties. - I almost bought one. - Um, - Singaporean, I think. - Korean. - My fucking car is gone! - All that money, you can buy ten, 20 Hyundais. - Oh, the money was in... - There was money in the car? I mean like in a briefcase? - Like Pulp Fiction? - You know, you never actually see what's in the briefcase. They say it was his soul. How much money we talking about? There was no fucking money in that car. I thought that's why you were so upset at those white kids - from Los Feliz. - White kids jacked your car, take your briefcase of money? Don't worry. - I'll take care of it. - Oh yeah, I'll help out too. Um... what color's your car? - It's red. - I thought your car was blue. - It's fucking red! - Hatchback or sedan? - Hatchback. - Hatchback? - Accent or Elantra? - Elantra's roomier. Yeah but the Accent handles better and has more pep. - Did you just say "Pep"? - Yeah, pep. To add liveliness or vigor to something.

Not a gang really. Just a bunch of homies. Friends, family... ...with all kinds of benefits. But, when I left the gang and went solo... I became isolated. It was just me out there. Alone. Killing motherfuckers. And hoping that I didn't get killed. No one had my back. Every day was Dia de Muertos, Russian roulette. Kill... or be killed. But, like any job, I got used to it. I punched the clock. Trudged through. Being a hit man was just something I did to pay the bills, while I did things that I love. Grandma. Grandma. Grandma. Grandma! - Hi, Daddy. - Hey, baby.

I mean, do you have a long-term care plan in place? No, not really. Well, your grandmother has too many health problems. She's beyond your care. She needs to be in a long-term facility. - No sick place... - No, I know, Sands Manor. Sands Manor is an excellent facility. I'll begin the paperwork to have her transferred there. Uh, if I couldn't afford that right now... She'll get whatever Medicaid covers. - Probably Senior Living... - No! I know, I know. No!

No stay, party with us. With Isaac's money I put Grandma in Sands Manor. And put a down payment on a new car. Same model, same color. Call me superstitious... but there's a reason I'm still alive. I don't understand why you have to use those women. They look straight out of a porno. Don't they, Becca? They look like porno girls. They're supposed to look like that. That's the whole... schtick. Did you hear that, Ma? "Schtick!" I told you he's assimilating. Oh no, just water, thank you. So, how's the business doing? You don't need any more money, do you? I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Isaac knows I'm a kidder. Don't you, Isaac? - You're a kidder. - So... I don't understand why you don't just quit with the mattress business and come to work with us, already. - I don't like Jewish food. - Isaac, don't offend mother. What? He doesn't like my food. Big deal. I didn't... He didn't say he didn't like your food, Mom. - I gotta go. - You're going out again tonight? I thought you were going to take me shopping. - I'm meeting with clients. - I'll take you. - We'll have more fun, anyway. - Y'all have a good time okay. Aren't you forgetting something? Kisses, kisses... Snooky, snooky. - Bye. Love you! - Love you, too. Ya'll have fun, okay. You guys are adorable! Simply adorable. So? - What? - Oh come on. You've always been a horrible liar. - What are you talking about? - Come on! For lunch, egg salad, not tuna. Water, not wine with dinner. - You're pregnant! - Ah! I wanted to tell Isaac first. I knew it! I knew it! Even before the tuna salad, I knew it! You just have that glow! - I know. Okay, so... - Oh my God. Yeah? If it's a boy, I wanna name it Khali. Oh. It means "good."

Calm down, calm the fuck down! - Isaac, is that you? - What the fuck! Oh my God. You've vomited all over my hard wood floor. - And my rug. - He'll clean it up, Mom. He's been out again with those porno girls. - He was with Don and Tr... - I know it. Wait, wait. You were checking up on me? I have a right to know where you are. Oh, and, thank you for inviting me to the party. You said it was a business thing. It was a business thing. Don's my client. A client? He bought a mattress from you, two years ago. Yes, a Cali King. - I'm going to bed. - Pillow top. He paid me two grand. Affirmation time. I am not a victim. I create my life... and my destiny. I am not a victim. I create my life... and my destiny. - This is good. - I told you, right? And I don't just cook Spanish. Thai, Mediterranean... Italian. Whatever you want. - I got you. - Damn, okay. - Oh, I love this song! - You dance? Yeah, I dance. I don't salsa though. - You don't salsa? - No. How can you be from East LA and not salsa? - You don't! - What... Ah, get up. Let me show you, let me show you. - No! - Come on, come on, I got you. One step forward. And two steps back. You're gonna show me how to salsa? I gotta see this. - Okay. - One step forward. Okay. And two steps back. - Just like my life. - Yeah? I mean, it's like... Always trying to move forward and shit just always happens. - So, you're a victim? - Nah, I ain't no victim. There you go. One step forward, two steps back. What is it that you do anyway? I told you. Oh, yeah, a repo man? - That's what you used to say. - It's... it's like I do the shit work that nobody else wants to do. That's what I do. Come on. But if they don't pay their bills, I guess they deserve it, right? Sometimes they do and sometimes... they're just like the rest of us. Everybody screws up... but we try our best, right? One step forward, two steps back? Do you have a map? 'Cause I'm getting lost in your eyes. You're corny. Stop. You're... Come on! One step forward. Two steps back. Hold on a second. - Hey, baby. - Hey, babe... Sorry to bother you at work. Oh, it's okay. I was on a... I was on a break. What up? Tori wants some canned pasta but I can't find it anywhere. And I just reorganized the whole pantry. So, I have a pretty good handle on the status of the canned goods. I always hide it from her or she eats too much. It's in the... it's on the top shelf, behind, uh... It's by my smoothie stuff next to the chia seeds. - Okay, love you. - Okay. Well, I gotta get back. Okay, babe. Have a good shift. Okay. I will. Hey, I gotta go. Oh yes! Oh yes! Yes! Cor! Cor, I just hit sixteen mil on Trivia Bomb it's your turn! - Hey. - Hey, babe. Hey, do you think I can have the bathroom to myself? Um... yeah. Yeah, no... no problem. I can just do my Neti Pot later. I love you bunches. - I love you, too. - Okay. The Cartel found out that Isaac hired me and they weren't about to let e off the hook. - Get in the car. - They wanted the blood to be on my hands. Not theirs. You didn't do your job, Khali. See, we could have done it for you. But... we don't want to get our hands dirty. But if we have to... ...we will. Oh, and Khali... if our friend Isaac finds out about any of this... we'll skin you alive. Mom, why are you still a member at Hillgate, anyway? Like I would never show my face there. Well, your father loved it. So, when he divorced me, I told my lawyer I wanted his membership. Of course. It's not one of my favorite country clubs, but you should never underestimate the power of spite. - Hola, senorita. - Just listen, okay. Um... - What's my favorite color? - What? Just answer. Please? Yellow. Hmm. - What kind of yellow? - The washed out yellow. The one on the convertible on your screen saver. - What's my favorite song? - "Cruisin'," the D'Angelo version. How many birthmarks do I have? A cross-shaped birthmark on your left ass cheek. And a scar from wrecking your Huffy bike, - when you were 11 years old. - You were a horrible teacher. You were a horrible student. If you'd listen, maybe you coud ride a bike today. You know me better than anybody. - I'd say that's true. - You love me. - I do. - That wasn't a question. I know you do. And I know you'll take care of me. Look... I don't care what you did in the past. I know that you banged. And I was a little hood rat. I did some shit to pay the bills. Some bad shit. But I'm straight now. And I'm responsible. And I just need to know for me, and for my daughter... Are you good? Yes. I'm good. I love you. So, when are you gonna tell Isaac? I think I'm gonna surprise him. I think I wanna cook his favorite meal... Oh, speaking of meals, you better watch yourself. You don't wanna use a pregnancy as an excuse to pig out. Oh, mom. When I had you, I only gained 20 pounds. And then, in less than a month, I was back in my little black dress. Is that from me? Uh, no. That was from your brother. My brother? Yeah. He died before you were born. The umbilical cord wrapped around his neck. He suffocated? Probably the only way to shut up a member of our family. Yeah. That's true. Oh, sorry. Uh, how much longer are you gonna be? 'Cause my mom is coming to get me in like five. Yo! Hey! Hey! It's me! George. Remember me? The nurse. I patched you up. Hey! Wait. Khali? Khali? Wait up! Hey! Hey! Where you going? Hey! Did you find your car yet? Ow. Ow. Oh, man. Are you okay? Ah... Hey, didn't you see that sign? Shit. I've been keeping an eye out for your car and the briefcase. Man, I hope you find it. I bet you hid it, didn't you? Like in a secret compartment in the trunk. Shit! I'll get your number from Axel. And I'll call you if I hear anything. Blue Hyundai, right? - Did you park on the roof? - Fuck! Hey, kiddo. I love you, you know that, right? - Uh-huh. Yeah. - Good. - But not bye forever? - No. No, well, technically, that's up to your mom. But... All right Don't fucking do this. Wait... Cori...

Be responsible... - I am being responsible. - ...for once. I'm done, and you need to leave. Get the fuck out. - Get out. - How dare you do this to me? - Get out. - After everything that I've done for you. I've given you everything, Cori. Everything. You know, you... What were you when we met? You were nothing. Nothing. - Just Mexican trash. Okay and... - Fuck you. - Get out, sorry ass. - You know it's true. Get out! Go! Just go! Go! What's up? Have you ever done something that you know will have consequences, but... you do it anyway, because, Khali... you have to? Hey. It's gonna be alright. I gotta pee.

And I miss my home. I know, grandma. I mean, I miss you, too. But... but I can't take care of you. I mean, I don't have the medical qualifications and if something happens, you know... I know. I know. Homie just shit his pants, dawg. Look at him, dawg. All scared and shit. That's right, dawg. That's a bitch right there. Now I knew I had to get the fuck outta Dodge. Even if it meant leaving Cori, my daughter, my Grandma. Everything. I had to go and be gone for good. Well, there he is. - This looks... great. - I made your favorite... Latkes. I'm kidding, I made lasagna. With pork sausage. Just like you like it. What's the occasion? Well, sit down. - Is it that good? - Yeah. - Did we win the lottery? - Close. Is your mother moving out? You're pregnant? Yeah. They don't know for sure yet, but... I haven't had any morning sickness and Ma says that means, it's a boy. A boy? Yeah. A son? - I think... I think I'm gonna be... - No. Not again. It's okay. - I'm okay. - Look at me. You don't have to be nervous about this. About any of it. I love you. You're a good guy. This is all gonna work out like it should. Okay? - Hello? - Mr. Cabres? - Hello? - Mr. Cabres, this is Carmen Rockwell from Malibu Sands Manor. I'm afraid your monthly payment is overdue. When can I arrange to transfer your grandmother to a different facility? Tr... tran... transfer? No, no, no transfer. I... I'll get the money soon, okay? Mr. Cabres, I'm afraid we can't give you much longer. We have a waiting list for your grandmother's room and... Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Listen, um... I know... I know we ain't been on good speaking terms. I haven't done this in a while... but... but if you help me... if you help out my grandmother, I'll be good. Yo. What? I... Uh... Are you sure? You found my car! Yeah! Yes! Yes! Yeah! Hey, loco. What'd you do with the jack? I need the jack. Hey, Bobby, what'd you do with the blue Hyundai? The blue Hyundai? I think the blue Hyundai's gone. It's crushed. Hey, there he is. How's the nose? This is my buddy's place, uh, they buy a lot of cars here without titles. So I had them put a BOLO out on yours. - That wasn't it? - No. No, your car's fine. But I have some bad news. No briefcase. I know what you're thinking. And it did occur to me to take it for myself and not call you, but... I didn't think that would be a really good lesson for Cali, here. I believe you. Here you go. Fuck man! Whoa! Cease fire. It's for you. What is it? Whoo! That's a whole lot of cash. You got some serious money right here... Hey! If you ever need anything... Yeah. We got your back, brother. Yeah. You know where to find us. Thank you. - Yeah. - Yeah. Come on, let's go. Ladies, ladies, ladies. Come on, come on. I got the bags. I got the bags. I just don't understand what's going on. - It's a surprise - A surprise? I don't want a surprise. - I need to plan my baby shower. - The sooner we... You can plan it on the drive. It's gonna be a serene drive, - and you can plan it. - Serene? Where are we going? I just don't understand what's going on? We're going on a trip. It's a surprise trip. I can't tell you where we're going - because that would ruin it. - Oh god! Are you okay? I am so sorry that happened, but if we would go... Do not worry about the plant. Come on. We're waiting and you're not walking. - I'm late. Come on. - You're paying? I'm paying. I'm paying double for this. Ladies, I hate to do this but I am serious. If I need to change the tone of my voice to get you out the door, I will. Come on, let's go. I'm not angry. Is this the way to start a trip? I put a lot of effort into the surprise. Now let's go. I don't have anything to say to you. If I told you that I had enough money to take care of you and Tori forever, would you come with me? - Where would we go? - Where would we go? Wherever you want. Hawaii. Europe. I have to know. Where did you get the money? No. No, Khali. I'm not going back to that life. - I can't. - No, Cori. It's not good for me or my daughter. Please, baby, I gotta know. Just come with me. Baby, just come with me. Please, Cori. Please. Please come. Please. Come back in a month and we'll talk. I don't have a month. I don't... I don't have a month. Let's go. Just... Let's just go. - Get Tori and let's go. Please. - I'm sorry. I can't do this. - Co... Cori. - I'm sorry. - No, Cori. Cori... - I'm sorry. One step forward... two steps back. I prayed for a sign... and it flew in like fucking Tinkerbell. Khali, what are you doing here, man? What... - It's for the cab. - For the... It's only 50 bucks, man. That's cool. - Here, this is... - Nah. You're a good dude, Walter. - I'm sorry. Take care. - It's all good, bro. Okay, you can let go now. - How did you find me? - I told you... we'd find you wherever you go. Cover your ears, baby. - Are you fucking kidding me? - What? What I do now? Walter just called. And? Why you gotta be so good, Khali? - You think I'm good? - No! You're just good enough. Let's get outta here. - But what about my car? - I'll get you another car, so what? Let's go. What? This has gotta be the stupidest... - Come on. - ...stupidest thing I've ever done. Were you arrested earlier? Not. 'Cause it's a crime to look so fine. - Shut up! - It was perfect. We were riding off into the sunset. Sure, I'd made my deal with Isaac and the cartel. But what were the chances I'd run into them? - Just wait, okay, wait. - I'm pregnant. I need to pee. You have to make it to the next town. Okay, babe? Isaac, why are you smoking? This is a gas station, for God's sake. For God's sake, I've told you a million times, it's an electronic cigarette. Electronic! - I can't. - Can't you just put it away? I'm gonna put it in my pocket, you happy? - Thank you. - Yeah. This smells good. It's strawberry banana. It's not gonna hurt you. - It's still not good for me. - Crazy. Oh my God! - Oh, that man has a gun, Isaac. - I see that, Sarah. Man, look, look, look. We're straight, okay, I promise. Oh, now we're straight, huh? Hey, look, man. - Becca's pregnant. - Excuse me? - I'm gonna have a son. - Is that the gardener? - Get them to shut up. - Isaac... Tell them to fucking shut up! Man, if I could shut them up, we wouldn't be here right now. What does that even mean? I don't know what he's doing. What's he doing? Will you shut up? Put that gun down. Put that gun down! - Khali! - Put that shit down! Put the gun down, bro. - Back up! - Alright! Alright! Alright! Isaac, what is going on? Let's go. You know what the fuck this is. - Isaac! - Move! Move! Get out of the car! Get out of the fucking car! Okay! God! - Isaac. - Get in the trunk! Fuck, get outta the fucking car! - What do you want? - My baby. Shut the fuck up. - Get in! Get in the car. - Oh my god! Hurry. Arturo. How much do they owe you? How much do they owe you? More than you got. I got two million right now. To settle everything. But then you can't fuck with them or you can't fuck with us ever again. Well, let me see. Meet me at the overlook on Ranger. Ten o'clock tonight. - Arturo! No! - Homie! - Arturo! - Back up! - No, no, no! - No! No! That's my fucking little girl! - No, baby! - Get out of the car now! - Let go of her! - Back the fuck up! Let's go. Let's go. Get your hands off! Get your fucking hands... - That's my baby! - Shut up! Let go of me! Khali! - Just an insurance policy. - Baby. Let go! That's not part of the fucking deal. - Get in! - Khali! Cori! Don't worry. I'm coming. I will see you at ten. Khali! Careful, she's pregnant. We're gonna have to charge more now. Isaac, what is he talking about? Everything's cool. Khali'll be here any second. - No. What is he charging for? - Just shut up and do what they say, okay? I don't know about you, but, uh... I'm getting tired of waiting. No! No! Stop! He's here! Well, I guess he showed up after all. Before we get down to business... Isaac, you wanna tell them what's up? May I? Tell them. Fucking tell them! I owe a bunch of money to the cartel. I hired... Khali to kill you and your mom, so... I could collect the inheritance and pay off my debt. But I changed my mind. I changed my mind. - I'm sorry. - Okay. Let's do this. Count and then get the fuck outta here. Here. Go ahead. Go ahead. No, no, no, no. You can leave them down there. I think we'll be collecting your money along with the inheritance, amigo. Fuck that, homie. The odds are not in your favor. Oh, this is so sad. You're such a nice guy. You think you're fucking better than us, huh? No. Is that what you think? I know who the fuck you are. Decapitating motherfuckers, huh? You think this fool's better with a fucking chainsaw than me? You will burn in the same hell as me. No. Drop your weapons, or we'll drop you, I shit you not! Keep your eyes on him, guys. Steady. Watch their hands. Keep those weapons on them. Your life. Your money. Business... is business. Business is business. Vamonos. - Let's close in, guys. - Boys. That's right. Keep walking. Boys, over here. Boys. It's okay. It'll be okay. Your prisoner. Get up. Thank you. Get in the car. Come on. Isaac didn't go to jail. And Becca was nice enough for my sake not to involve the police. Instead, she made Isaac sign a divorce agreement where he got nothing. Here you go. Gracias (thank you). - Yes. Gracias. - De nada (here you go). Gracias (thank you). - Gracias! - Gracias. As for Grandma, I couldn't afford to pay for Sands Manor anymore. But I worked something out. As for me, I got a job at a gourmet restaurant. Mm, our new chef is looking great! Thank you. Even got this fool a job. As for Cori... I thought she gave up on me. This place is getting rave reviews. We had to come check it out. - I'm glad you came. - Mm-hm. I'm really proud of you. Is there an airport nearby? Or is that just my heart is taking off? - I don't care how bad your... - Oh shit! - I almost forgot. - Get up there and clean the shit - out of the tub. - Isaac did remarry. And for all the shit he fucked up, he did do something right. And this, my friends... is the new Khali.
