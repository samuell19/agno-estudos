[MUSIC PLAYING] Make a wish, Amanda. [CHEERING] [NOISE MAKERS] What is it? Take a look. KIDS: Ooh. What a nice bear. Happy birthday. Thanks, Dad. -Yes, sweetheart. -Thanks, Mom. I love you. -Catch me up. -Uterine rupture. Patient's in third trimester. Massive blood loss. Fetus viable? Based on size, yes. Then it's a cesarean. Let's go, Julia. I heard you had a hell of a night. Did the mother make it? -We saved them both. -Good. I'll go check it out. Honey, it's nothing. [SILENCED GUNSHOT] ELIZABETH: Larry? Larry? [GASP] Oh-- oh, god, no. Don't. [SILENCED GUNSHOTS] [THUD] MAN: Get back down here. [GASP] Mm, he's dead all right. Did you check the girl's room? Not yet. I don't think it's in here. I don't think they kept it in the house. Don't worry, it's only paint. What do we do with the girl? She won't know anything. Let's just get out of here. -Thank you. -Sure. Hey, would you mind letting me in? Oh. Um, I'm sorry, but I'm really not supposed to-- Oh, it's no problem. You don't know me from Adam. If you could just tell the manager then, Mr., um-- Jackson, that Kevin Finney's locked himself out. Again. [CHUCKLE] Come on. So we're neighbors. Yeah, I guess so. Excuse me. We're looking for a Dr. Julie Kerbridge. Ah, that's me. Lieutenant, here's a ballistics report. Right. What about skin samples from the house? Good. Get them up to the lab. Brian, you want to make me another copy? This one sucks. -Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Mike. Dr. Kerbridge, I'm Lt. Waldron. BRIAN: Sam, the DA's office is on 2. Brian, tell them I'm not taking any calls now. I'm with the girl's aunt. The officers wouldn't tell me anything. Why don't we go into my office. What happened to my sister? Your sister and brother-in-law were shot. What? It happened last night. I'm sorry. We're pretty sure it was a burglary. There were signs of forced entry, and the house was pretty much picked clean. I just can't believe this. So were you at the party? What party? There were decorations, leftover cake. We figured there was a birthday party for the girl. Oh my god, Amanda. Where is she? Is she OK? Yeah, come with me. Before we go in there, there's one thing-- your niece hasn't spoken a word since we found her. She's probably in shock. Hi, Amanda. [CLEARS THROAT] No sign of physical trauma? -No. I gave her a thorough exam. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Dr. Kerbridge. Here are some of Amanda's things. And I'm also going to need your signature, your name, address, and phone number on the release form. Uh, what? I don't understand. I'm sorry, it's my fault. You see, I do this 10 times a week, and I forget that this is all very new to you. In a case like this, we turn the child over to her new legal guardian right away. The sooner that she gets back to a normal routine, the better for her. N-- no, I'm not her-- You are the next of kin, right? Yes, but-- WOMAN: Amanda, let's go get you washed up. So you don't want to take custody? Custody? I'm a third year resident at the Unitarian Hospital. I work 16 hours a day. Are there any other relatives that live in the area? No. Larry had some family back East, some cousins or something. Are there any grandparents, aunts, uncles? No. Just me. So what's going to happen to Amanda? She will become a ward of the state. Eventually, hopefully, we will find foster parents for her. In the meantime, she'll be staying at the County Juvenile Ward. No, no, I don't want her going through that. She can stay with me until you find her foster parents. Dr. Kerbridge, you realize that that process can take several months. That's fine. You have to understand, I'm only trying to do what's best for her. I'll go get Amanda now. Dr. Kerbridge, if you can, we'd like Amanda to see the police psychiatrist. So the first thing we've got to do is get you back into school, see all your friends. Won't that be nice? [SIGH] Amanda, don't you want to play with the puppet? Dr. Kerbridge, what can you tell me about your sister and brother-in-law-- their lifestyles, habits, friends? Not much, really. I know what Elizabeth used to be like when we were kids. But, um-- But what? Beth got married, and Larry and I never hit it off. I went east for med school. I came back for my residency. But six years is a long time, and the hours are crazy. God. I'm just making excuses. I should've spent more time with them. We could give her an EEG, CAT scan, maybe even an MRI. But I don't think the problem's organic. So selective mutism. Amanda's choosing not to speak. Unconsciously, yes. Following the loss of a loved one, children's social skills often suffer. Amanda's becoming mute is extreme, but then, so is her trauma. What can I do? Give her all the love you can. She needs to feel safe, secure. Hell, we all do. When do you think she'll speak? When she's ready, Amanda will start talking. In the meantime, I can suggest a trauma specialist. Linda Freeman's good. So is William Ettinger. Oh, Bill Ettinger. We worked a case a couple years back. He's good. Good luck. Thank you, Doctor. OK. All right, thanks. PRIEST: We hereby commit the bodies of Elizabeth Meyer and Larry Meyer to the ground. Earth to earth, dust to dust. You are now joined for eternity with the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost. [TAPPING] Just once, you only have to press it once. OK? [TAPPING] Just once, Amanda, all right? Thank you. [DING] Oh. So sorry. You OK? -Yes. OK. Here you go. Well, hello there. How are you today? Nothing? Nope. Your daughter plays her cards very close to the vest. She's my niece, and she's not talking a lot right now. You know what? If I were carrying money around inside my ears, I wouldn't talk to anybody either. Here you go. For you. I'm late for rehearsal. Good to see you. [TAP] -Once. [GASP] What? Oh. Amanda. What's wrong? You sick? Did you have a bad dream? Well, it's, um-- it's just a nightmare. You're OK. You can go back to bed. [BEEPING] [SIGH] It's the hospital. What are we going to do with you? So tell me, Julia, you ready for the board? Oh, I'm exhausted. -Join the club. -Julia. Hey, Sandy, what's up? Excellent work in there. You didn't even need me. Thank you, Dr. Rydell. I know you're going through hell right now. We'll give you all the support we can. I appreciate that. Of course, that doesn't help with your boards. What are they, now, a week and a half away? You, Bob, Sandy, all the interns know we have an open staff position. We've looked at hundreds of candidates, and you're the top of the list. I should know, I'm head of the search committee. Thanks, that's great to hear. Figured you could use some words of encouragement about now. Frankly, you should know what's at stake. Do well on those boards, and the position's yours. How's your niece doing? -So-so. -Good night. -Good night. How's she doing? This munchkin? She's perfect. Hey, munchkin. [TOY SQUEAKING] Here we are. You don't want to go, do you? Are you scared? Come on, Amanda. School's fun. [BELL] And you have story time, and art, and recess. God, I wish I could go to school. TEACHER: Hurry up, hurry up. Look, I know you don't want to do this, but I can't be late. You have to go. [KIDS SHOUTING] Pass it, pass it. Here, Amanda. BOY: Here! Here! Here! Here! The patient was admitted yesterday with fever, abdominal pain, and nausea. Blood work indicates a high level of calcium. Preliminary diagnosis? Sounds like Crohn's colitis to me. It'll take a colonoscopy to confirm, but I agree. So let's assume the tests confirm your diagnosis, what do you prescribe? Oh, Julia, excuse me. It's your niece's school on the phone. Sounds urgent. [SIGH] Excuse me. So, Bob-- What happened, Amanda? Did you see something? You don't know, or you don't remember? OK look, fine. We'll talk about this later, OK? What? What do you want me to do? I was pulled out of rounds. I can't afford that right now. Amanda, I shouldn't have gotten upset. I'm sorry. But you know, this is hard for me too. I've-- I've never had any practice being a mom, and I don't think I'm very good at it. [CHUCKLE] Thanks. Bye bye. Good afternoon, Lt. Waldron. I'm Nate Henderson, president of Milne Technologies. Have a seat. I understand you have some questions concerning Lawrence and Elizabeth Meyer. I appreciate your cooperation, Mr. Henderson, but you didn't have to come down personally. It's just a standard inquiry. I'm afraid there's nothing standard about it. We have reason to believe that the Meyers have been stealing classified software materials from our company. What kind of software are we talking about? I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to tell you that. And when exactly were you planning on informing us about this theft? Well, you have to understand our position. This is a highly competitive, trillion dollar industry. Now we have to maintain utter silence. Even from the police. Until you need us, I suppose. Until we need you. [TAPPING] Chinese. Mexican. Burgers again. -Hey. Hi. Is there a school holiday I don't know about? Did I miss Arbor Day again? No, we had a little problem at school. Mm. I had a lot of little problems at school. They were called report cards. [PHONE RINGING] Oh, that's probably the hospital. I was supposed to call in. This is Dr. Kerbridge. Your aunt's a very busy lady. Hey, got a new one. Uh, yes, Dr. Ettinger, what can I do for you? Yes, someone from the police left a message concerning your niece. Right, I think Lt. Waldron mentioned your name. Well, Miss Kerbridge, I've had some experience in trauma-induced mutism. I think I might be able to help Amanda. If you're interested, we could schedule a consult. How's tomorrow morning? Well, I have rounds in the morning. Can we make it in the afternoon? The afternoon will be fine. Let's say 3:30? OK. Where are you? ETTINGER (ON PHONE): 3456 Harvard. Come on. We'll see you then. Bye bye. -Dr. Kerbridge. -You can call me Julia. Good. You must be Amanda, huh? Please, come in. Just go in to your left, Amanda. Amanda, do you like to write? Well, good, because I've got a little surprise for you. Go ahead, take it. It's yours. Now if you ever want to tell your aunt or me something, you can just write it here. OK. That's a very good start. Tell you what, why don't you go sit down over there and draw something, and I'm going to talk to your aunt for a second, OK? Good. What do you think? Well, I was hoping you could tell me. I mean, as you know, home is often the source of a mute child's problems-- violent parents, sexual abuse, that sort of thing. That doesn't apply to Amanda. Oh, that's my point exactly. You see, in Amanda's case, your home is where she'll feel most safe, where she'll be most likely to open up. OK, so, maybe I should keep a record of everything she writes down? Oh, absolutely. OK. Anything she tries to communicate, pass it on to me, particularly if it relates to the night of her parents' death. -OK. -All right. Let's see how she's doing. This is the third time this winter there's been a power failure. Go ahead and sit down over there, all right? I'm going to go light some candles, all right? Just sit right there. [THUD] Ow! Ouch! What's this doing here? You OK, Amanda? OK. [SCREAM] Run, Amanda! [CLATTER] Oh, god! Run, Amanda! Hey. Hey, what's wrong? What is it? What? There's somebody in my apartment. When Forensics is done taking prints, we'll compare them with the ones we lifted at your sister's house. Do you think this is related to my sister's murder? Maybe. You see, Milne's missing something. As you know, Elizabeth and Larry were working for that high tech company, Milne Technology. Their president seems to think your sister and brother-in-law were involved. You're saying that Elizabeth was a criminal? That's impossible. Look, I'm sorry, no disrespect meant. But you said yourself, you'd grown apart. A lot can happen over the years. People change. At any rate, I put a squad car outside. If you see anything suspicious, call me. -Thank you, Lieutenant. -Sure. You OK? Hey. Everything OK? No, not really. I'm afraid to go back in the apartment. Why don't you come down here? I got some food. I could heat it up. Um, no, we really-- we couldn't. Oh, come on, sure you could. All you gotta do is say yeah. Come on. What do you think? Go? OK. This is really very good, isn't it? I'm impressed. -Oh, come on. It's not that good. -I was kidding. [CHUCKLE] So you're a musician. In theory. No, I do. I play jazz violin. Hm, can you make-- can you make a living at it? Depends on how you define "living." I've had to do a lot of jobs to support myself-- word processor, cabby, stuff like that. I've had my share of crappy jobs too. I spent five years as an insurance claims processor to save money for med school. Right. [BEEPING] -Can I borrow your phone? -Oh, yeah. It's over there. -Thanks. This is Dr. Kerbridge. And they've switched me to the early shift, so we'd better be going soon. Did the guy who broke in take anything? Was anything missing? -I don't know. I haven't had a chance to look. And your sister hadn't given you anything recently, right, like a gift? You know, Kevin, I've been interrogated once already today. -You're right. It's none of my business. I'm sorry. It's just that, um-- I keep waiting for things to get back to normal, and they just don't, you know? Well, if it's any consolation, I think you're holding up pretty well. But then again, the greatest stress in my life is trying not to fall asleep during a drum solo. [LAUGH] [CLEARS THROAT] I was just resting my eyes. It's OK, Julia. It's no crime to take a nap. But I did want to talk to you about something. Boards are in four days. Now normally, I wouldn't suggest this, but given your situation, it's possible to postpone your boards. What would happen to the position? It would get filled. Then I won't postpone. I can't play favorites, Julia. Survival of the fittest is the law here. It has to be. Nice seeing you again, Amanda. Come on, Amanda, let's pack up. [VIOLIN MUSIC PLAYING] [DING] Go to Kevin's apartment, OK? Isn't that pretty? It's nice having a musician in the building. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Just a minute. Hey. Hey. -That was very pretty. -Oh, yeah. Thank you. It's one of my favorites. Um, I don't mean to wear out my welcome, but I've got to go out for a couple of hours, and I was wondering if you could, um-- Oh, me and Slim? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Thanks. Now, Amanda, you mind Kevin, OK? You two are angels. [GASP] Dr. Kerbridge, I'm Janet, Elizabeth and Larry's real estate agent. I didn't realize you were going to be here this early. I got here early. The door was open. Well, I apologize for having to do this so soon, but we must get this house on the market as soon as possible. KEVIN: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5-6-7-8-9-10! Here I come. I think I'll check the bedroom. [EVIL LAUGH] I'll bet you she's under the bed. I'll just have a look. Nope. It's not here. I'll try the closet. Huh. Guess I was wrong. Well, well, well. Where could she be? She's little. Maybe she's in here. [DRAWER SLAM] Nope. You know, I'm just stumped. You know, Slim, you two ought to think about splitting up. Bears are pretty conspicuous around these parts. This guy have a name? Oh, Bonnie. Sorry, I didn't know you were a girl. So where'd you get Bonnie? Your parents give her to you? Yeah? Bet you they gave you a lot of nice things, huh? Come here. I want to tell you a story. It's about this guy. I grew up with him, actually. And he didn't talk. Nothing. And his parents tried everything. They took him to doctors. They gave him milkshakes. They gave him candies. Years go by. One night, he's at the dinner table. He looks up to his father, and he says, this chicken tastes like crap. His father says, Little Johnny, eight years you say nothing, and then all of a sudden tonight-- why? Kid looks at his dad, and he says, well, up until now, I didn't have any complaints. [DOOR OPENING] [FOOTSTEPS] MAN: Don't scream. Don't even move. Now listen. Your sister stole something from me. You're going to give it back. [SLAM] [SCREAM] Or I will break into your home in the middle of the night and set fire to the girl while she sleeps. Please, do not think you can fool me. Your sister already made that mistake. Wait. How can I give you what I don't have? Amanda. -Hey. Come on. Are you all right? Let's go inside. 7. No. These waters are fished out, huh? Well, don't peek at it. I saw you peek at it. Um. King. King. Hey. Slim, I'm taking a little break, OK? No cheating while I'm gone. No peeking. So what's wrong? What do you mean? Come on, you're as jumpy as a cat. Lt. Waldron told me my sister was involved in some sort of corporate theft. Of course, I didn't believe him. But today, I went to the bank, and I found false passports, airplane tickets. KEVIN: Did you tell Waldron? No. Why not? When I left the bank, there was this man. He knew everything. And he had a gun, and he said he'd kill Amanda if I didn't return it. What? You have got to go to the police. No, I can't. [PHONE RINGING] Yes? Dr. Kerbridge, good morning. It's Joan down at County Social Services. I've got some great news. Really? Yes. I found a couple that would like to adopt Amanda. Now I know that this is not exactly what we had discussed, but it would save her from bouncing from foster home to foster home. Dr. Kerbridge? Um. Sorry. Go on. The couple would like to meet Amanda. Now when would be a convenient time for you? [ENGINE TURNING OVER] Hey. Hey. Got a problem? This car won't start, and we're late for a doctor's appointment. Come on. I'll give you a lift. -OK. That's it. All right, now, Amanda, I want you to draw something that makes you happy, something you did with your mommy and daddy, OK? Is that Saturn, Amanda? That's excellent. Did you and your mommy and daddy go to the planetarium? All right, Amanda, I want you to close your eyes. Amanda, I want you to tell me everything about that night. I'm sorry the appointment went so late. I'll make it up to you somehow. Well, you can make it up to me now. Why don't you have dinner with me? I know a great Chinese place. OK, but we can't stay out late. I've got to study. Don't worry, I'll get you to bed on time. [CLICKING] Amanda, leave Kevin's things alone. I mean, you wouldn't like it if he went through your stuff. You should listen to your aunt. [PLAYING VIOLIN] You know, this used to be a really good Chinese restaurant. What are you doing with a gun? Protection. Oh, and why do you need protection? Because I'm a musician that works late in areas of town that maybe aren't so safe. Good evening. May I take your order now? Oh, we'll need a couple of minutes. Very well. You know, I'm not buying any of this. What would you like to hear? Anything, as long as it's loud. No, um-- let the gentleman play. Excuse me? My friend here plays the violin. -Oh, no, that's-- it's fine. -No, do. We would all like to hear you play. Yeah, come on, Kevin. Amanda and I would really like to hear you play. All right. [PLUCKING STRINGS] [PLAYING VIOLIN] OK, let's eat. [APPLAUSE] Hey, hang on a sec. Well, that was pretty good, huh? Wasn't bad, not bad. I've never had Hungarian, but that wasn't bad. KEVIN: Never had goulash? Weren't raised with goulash? JULIA: Was not raised with goulash. What is goulash? [BEEP] [EXPLOSION] Oh my god! Kevin! Hey! Amanda! Come here, Amanda. [GRUNT] [HONKING] [CRASH] I doubt the explosion was meant to hurt anybody. It was probably just a diversion for the kidnapping. You recognize him? He threatened me yesterday. You should've called me. He said he'd kill Amanda. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to get back to her. He wouldn't have killed her. At least not till he got what he wanted. Did he say if he was working with your sister and brother-in-law? Not in so many words. He must have been. Obviously, there was some sort of falling out between them. Does this mean it's over? We found the same prints at your apartment and the murder scene. We'll print our boy here. My guess is they'll match. She's fast asleep. Do you still want me to look at the car? Yes, please. What do you think that man would've done with Amanda? You know what? We'll never have to find out. Ah, OK, give it a shot. [ENGINE STARTING] Oh. -Loose plug. -Thanks. You think he thought Amanda had what they're after? Oh, that's ridiculous. Isn't it? Hey, honey, where are your toys? In here? What do you have? What do you think? Oh, man. Honey, what else did you bring? This? [PHONE RINGING] Hello? [HEAVY BREATHING] Hello? Who is it? Who's there? What do you want? [DIAL TONE] [PHONE RINGING] I just got spooked, that's all. I got a call this morning. They may have found someone to adopt Amanda. Have you told her? I know I'm doing the right thing. I can't-- I'm not very good at motherhood. No. No, no, listen. Hey. This isn't a test that you have to pass or fail. All you have to do is love her. Oh, I do. I sacrificed everything to get where I am. I had to choose between being a doctor or having a family, and I made that choice years ago. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Come here. Hm? Look at that, huh? Paging Dr. Kerbridge, paging Dr. Kerbridge. We have a severed limb on a gingerbread man. Oh, yeah, condition's critical. I'm going to need some kitchen shears, stat. Kitchen shears? Oh, well, in an emergency like this, we'll have to make do. We've got to go. Amanda, we've got to go. Come on, let's go. -What? We just-- I'm-- I'm sorry. I just lost track of the time. OK. Come on, come on. Shit! You missed your rounds yesterday. I'm sorry. I called as soon as possible. You don't have to explain. With all that's going on, it's a wonder you've been able to keep up as well as you have. Keeping up is not good enough. I want that job. I know, and I'd like to see you get it. It's just that Bob is, what, 27? I'm 34. I can't afford to pass this up. Julia, I understand. And I hope you don't think I'm being a hard ass. But being a doctor is a 24-hour a day commitment. People's lives will be in your hands. It's my responsibility to make sure those hands are entirely capable. So will you be ready to take your boards or not? Yes. I'll take them with everyone else. [LAUGHTER ON TV] I'm A less experienced skier might be worried right about now, but not you. Oh, man. Right, Iceman? Go get them, Louis. [SCREAM] Oh, no thanks. You go ahead. Not today, sweetie. I've got too much studying to do. I said not today. Now I don't want to hear anything else about the planetarium, OK? Amanda, you've just spilled juice on my notes. You've ruined them. Amanda. Amanda. Amanda, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled at you. I'm mad at myself because I've been afraid to talk to you. Tomorrow morning, you're going to meet some very nice people. And-- and they're going to take care of you, just like your mommy and daddy did. Don't worry. I'm going to visit you all the time, and we're still going to be friends, OK? Amanda. Amanda, I'd like you to meet Susan Levin and her husband Mark. Hello, Amanda. We've heard so many nice things about you. She's even prettier in person. I'll let you get better acquainted. I'll be right back. We want to show you our little pets. You were right. I think that is the best thing for her. The Levins were so excited when I told them about Amanda. Mr. Levin's even learning sign language so he can teach it to her to help her communicate. They seem nice. They are. They have been on the adoption waiting list for six years. Under what kind of child that they would like to adopt, they just wrote, "anyone who needs love." Come on in. Amanda's an adorable little girl, Dr. Kerbridge. She's awfully shy though. We'll have to take extra good care of her after everything she's been through. She's been through so much. I'm going to need your signatures on all of these. Both sets at the X. Dr. Kerbridge, I know how difficult this must be for you, but I just want you to know how much Mark and I appreciate it. We've waited so long. I can't do this. Come on, Amanda. Dr. Kerbridge, it-- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Come on, sweetie. I have to postpone my boards. You didn't have to drive all the way here to tell me. I know, but I wanted to explain. I let my sister drop out of my life, and that was a mistake. You had a job to do, an important job. It's no excuse. We blew it. We let our priorities get screwed up. And now, I have a second chance with Amanda. Good luck. And remember, boards are every six months. It's never too late for a good doctor. Thanks. Wow. Look at that. Sort of looks like a brain. [LAUGH] An eyeball. BOY: Mom, I want to see Pluto. Where are we? WOMAN: No, Pluto's a planet and not a dog. That's so cool. Clear sky. Wow, look at that. Observatory, huh? This is a cool place. What is it? Pluto, yeah. Pluto, and then the P, and then this. That is so neat. [CRANKING] OK. [CLINK] What does it say? OK, let's see. $0.51. Turn your penny into one of those. Here, choose one of those. Let's see what I have in here. Amanda, I don't have a penny. Sorry. What a great idea. You are so smart. OK, let's see. This penny-- this penny doesn't fit. Do you have another one? Amanda? Amanda? Amanda! WOMAN (ON SPEAKER): Dr. Kerbridge, paging Dr. Kerbridge. Please report to the courtesy phone. Dr. Kerbridge, paging Dr. Kerbridge. This is Julia Kerbridge. Have you found Amanda? MAN (ON PHONE): Yes, I have the girl. Thank god. Where is she? MAN (ON PHONE): I want it back. What? Who is this? MAN (ON PHONE): Just because my partner-- or should I say my late partner-- is no longer here, doesn't mean you're off the hook. Look, I told your partner I don't have anything except Amanda. MAN (ON PHONE): I don't buy that. Give it back to me, or you'll have to fish the girl out of the reservoir. I'll call you at 5:00 tomorrow. [SHOUT] [CRASH] God. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Where is she, you bastard? What have you done with her? Hey, calm down. -What have you done with Amanda? -Calm down. Listen to me. -No! Listen to me. I don't know where she is. I'm not one of them. Oh, that's great. Then who the hell are you? -I'm an investigator. I work for a security firm. We deal in corporate espionage. Oh. That's just beautiful. So all the jokes, and staying with Amanda, and the tricks-- that was just a part of your plan. Yes. And what about the other night? No. That was different. [SLAP] Get out of my house. And if you come back here, I'm going to call the police. I'm sorry about Amanda. I just wanted to see if you were OK. [CRYING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? It's Lt. Waldron, I got some news for you. The dead man's fingerprints match. We got our guy. Oh, uh-- that's great. [BEEP] Could you hold on a sec? I've got another call. Hello? There you are. Doctor, I'm on the other line. Hold on. Ah, Ju-- That's Dr. Ettinger. I've got to go. Oh, small world. I got a 3 o'clock with Bill. Anyway, listen, I just called you to bring you up to speed. Take care, Dr. Kerbridge. -Thanks. That was Waldron. He says he'll see you at 3:00. Oh, that-- that's right, I'm seeing him at 3:00. Julie, what happened this afternoon? I mean, the sessions right now are so critical. Julia, is something wrong? Oh, no, no, I'm fine. I was just-- someone's kidnapped Amanda. Kidnapped? By whom? I don't know. Some man. He says I have something valuable, something that was taken from him. Do you have it? No, of course not. I don't even know what it is. All right, listen, Julia, Waldron should know about it. Look, I'm on my way to see him anyhow. Do you want me to tell him? -No. No. I have to do what he says. All right, I understand. But, Julia, call me if you need anything. Doctor. I thought you were on sabbatical in Europe. I was. Do I know you? Not well. We met at a conference last year. Oh, yes, I remember. You're in human resources in some high tech company. Most impressive, Dr. Ettinger. You have an excellent memory. Pity. [SILENCED GUNSHOT] Here. Let me help you. What in god's name was going through your mind? I was getting impatient. Oh, impatient. I was making excellent progress. Two sessions at the most, she would've told us everything. How do I know you hadn't already found the chip? That, uh-- you didn't get greedy? You didn't know. You had to trust. Any relationship is based on trust. Trust you? As it turns out, our cover would've been blown anyways. We have to move fast now. The esteemed Dr. Ettinger came back early from his sabbatical. He's in the car waiting for you. Take care of him. But first, where's the girl? Hi. You OK? Are you hungry? Did the bad man feed you? All right, Amanda, listen to me. The bad man needs to know some things about the night your parents died. Do you understand? All right, but if we work together, you and I, we can tell the bad man the things he needs to know, and then he'll let me take you home back to Aunt Julie, OK? OK? All right. Close your eyes. That's good. Now, Amanda, I want you to think and imagine everything I'm going to tell you. You're floating in space. Stars are glittering all around you. Above you. Below you. Now pick out the brightest star. Concentrate on that star. Really, really concentrate. That's it. That's it. Oh! It's OK, Amanda. You're safe. It's all right. You're with me. Here. Dry your tears. Dry your tears, all right? Now, I need you to write everything you remember. [CHUCKLE] [SIGH] You know the funny thing about it, Amanda, is I was really genuinely fond of you. Course, that won't stop me from killing you. Or your aunt. But you see, it's a matter of pride now. Now. Write down what you remember. Do it now. You're not writing. [KNOCK ON DOOR] KEVIN: Julia. Julia, I'm sorry I deceived you. I-- I was doing my job. Can you understand that? Please. I want to help. Oh. Help me or them? Wow. You really did a number on Bonnie. Kind of lost it. You even took the pennies out of the loafers? No. Amanda and I did that at the planetarium. You know, it wouldn't even fit into the machine. All she wanted to do was-- -What? It didn't fit? No. Please tell me you still have it. They're calling any minute. I can't believe that thing is worth so much money. Not when you think about it. It's a prototype of a semiconductor that manipulates light instead of electricity. It's revolutionary. Make anything out there now look like a pocket calculator. [PHONE RINGING] Tell them you need me to come with you. Yes? MAN (ON PHONE): Do you have everything? Yes. Good. On the other side of the city limits bridge, second exit. 147 Elder Lane. There's an old Victorian house. Be there. 147 Elder Lane. Obviously, you come alone. Wait-- wait-- I can't. I'm afraid. No Waldron. No boyfriends. If you're too weak to do it by yourself, then bring the shrink. Dr. Ettinger? -It's him or nobody. -No. JULIA (ON PHONE): OK. Your niece, she keeps asking for Bonnie. Who's Bonnie? I'm sorry, Kevin, I did the best I could. Give me the prototype. I'm sorry. This isn't yours to negotiate with. What? You said you were here for me and Amanda. When you said that I'd say anything, you were right. I don't believe this. Listen to me, if you give him this, he'll kill you. Then he'll kill Amanda. Your best chance is to go to the police and let them handle this. -No. I'm sorry. But it's the only way. I'm sorry. Give me the chip, Kevin. I need it for Amanda. We need to talk about this. No. -Listen to me. -No. Sorry, Kevin. Hi. Thank you for doing this. It's OK. It's best I'm here. Hello? This way. Anyone here? Amanda, are you OK? Where's the chip? Let her go. You want the girl, you'll give me the chip. He has it. You have the chip? I have it? It's in a fake penny in the bear. All right. I'll give you the stuffed animal, you give me Amanda. Let go! Ow! -Amanda! You're not going anywhere. [GUNSHOTS] Is everybody OK? Yeah, we're OK. -Where's Amanda. -She went out. KEVIN: Does she have the prototype? Yes. Amanda-- Wait. No, wait, wait. Amanda's obviously hysterical. Maybe I should talk to her first, calm her down. We need to call the police. -You OK? Dead battery. -I can call from my car. -Amanda. Amanda? Don't go! Don't go! The doctor's bad. The doctor's bad. Amanda's making great progress. Amanda. I'm going to hurt your aunt. Really bad. Come on. I'm going to hurt your aunt. Is that what you want, hm? There you are. Amanda, where's the bear, hm? KEVIN: I have it. Drop the gun. Let's keep this in perspective, shall we? I want that chip. If I have to kill them both to get it, I will. Makes no difference to me. Sorry. Drop the gun. Good. Now give me the chip. [GUNSHOT] JULIA: Run, Amanda, run! Don't mess this up. I am too close. Amanda. Amanda. Don't make me come looking for you. You'll be sorry. Come out, come out, wherever you are. Amanda. Peek-a-boo. [GASP] Come here. Come-- Amanda, come back here. [THUD] Oh! You don't give up, do you? [THUD] That's it. You want to know about your parents, Amanda? After three scotch at a computer show, your parents start gushing about their new baby. Oh, sorry to say, it wasn't about you. They were so proud of the success of their new prototype that it took no time at all to convince them to take it and reap the benefits for ourselves. Do you know the pressure, Amanda, of a high profile project like that prototype, hm? No? I spent months courting the Japanese, the Germans, getting them to go against each other. I even offered to sell the prototype back to Henderson. But, oh, your parents got greedy. They tried to cut us out. Let me ask you, Amanda, is that fair? Huh? Is it? Of course it isn't. Give me the doll! [GUNSHOT] Ow! Bitch, you're going to pay for that. -Julia, Julia! -You little rat. Come back here. [GUNSHOT] Don't move. [SHOUT] [GLASS SHATTERING] [GRUNTING] No, no, no, no! [SCREAM] [CRANKING] Look. I'll keep it forever. Forever starts today, OK? Come on, let's go. Hey, that's cool, isn't it? KEVIN: Hey. Hey. What you got there? All right. Are you hiding something? -Maybe. -What is it? I don't know, but it might be something for you. AMANDA: But my birthday was last month. Well, let's just say your birthday's been extended. Bonnie! Well, not Bonnie exactly. It's more like Bonnie the Sequel. No, she's perfect. [MUSIC PLAYING]
