I wouldn't call it a joke. But we are having fun. Lots of fun. Look, pal, real dinosaurs don't talk, and real dinosaurs don't laugh. (LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) 'Cause there aren't any real dinosaurs anymore. Oh, well, I'm as real as your imagination. Oh, ho, ho... Whoops! And that's something... Yeah, yeah, yeah. -But that doesn't explain... -Cody! You don't have to explain.

Yeah. Barney likes your barn. Well, I'm glad he likes it. Marcella, don't leave your little doll out there all night. Barney isn't just a little doll. He's very big. Oh, sure, he's big now, but you just wait. These fads come and go. Now, Cody, I did notice at the table that someone ate like a dinosaur tonight. Handsome fellow like me have to be careful what I eat. Got to watch my figure. I don't want to lose my girlfriend. Cody, I first met your grandmother when I was about your age.

MARCELLA: I'm gonna be the knight. Aren't you going to play, Cody? What? Some stupid pretend game? No way! Definitely not cool. Oh. Well, uh, what do you think is cool? Rock singers who spit fire, professional wrestling, real stuff. Oh, I see. But, you know, Cody, even for grownups the real adventures in life start with a dream. A dream? Prove it! Oh, you can only prove it to yourself, Cody. But you could start, um... Ah, you could start by wishing on a star. (SCOFFS) A star? As if. Stars are only glowing balls of gas a zillion miles from here. But I think there is a very special wishing star in the sky tonight. And it's right about there. Whoa! Want me to make a wish? I'll make a wish. I wish, wish... I wish I could have a real adventure this summer. Do things that no one else has done before. That would be cool. How's that for a wish, Barney? Barney? Barney?

I'll go find out. Make sure they don't go anywhere. You have to see this egg. Yes, of course, dear. Yes, it's really big, and it has colors and... Well, that doesn't sound like one of our chicken eggs. BOTH: It isn't! Well, in that case, you'd better talk to our neighbor, Mildred Goldfinch. -The bird lady? -GRANDMA: Yes. What bird lady? Oh, she'd love to see you, I bet. We met her last year, she's terrific. She's a bird watcher, dear, and I think she knows everything about eggs and birds. Why don't you children go on over there? -Yeah, come on. -Great, let's go! I will get this old wet diaper off of you, and you'll feel much better. (BABY COOS) What? You're tired of the same old look?

(GIGGLES) No. Ms. Goldfinch, um, Barney's a dinosaur. Yeah. If you two are about done, I have a question about an egg. Ouch! I'd hate to be the bird who laid that egg. I found it over at my grandparents farm. I'm not sure what kind of egg this is. We'll have to bring it inside my house to check it out. Oh, okay. (WHISTLE BLOWING) Oh. (BIRD SQUEAKS) (DOORBELL RINGS) Wow! ABBY: Oh, it's an elevator. BARNEY: It's great! MARCELLA: Where'd all the birds come from? ABBY: People from all over the world send her birds that are sick. And once I help them get well, most of them want to stay. I tell you, I buy birdseed by the barrel. Thank you. (CAWS) Birdseed by the Barrel. How you doing today, Ms. Goldfinch? Hey, Mr. Millet. GOLDFINCH: He owns Birdseed by the Barrel. He's making his weekly delivery. (WHIRRING AND CHIMING) MARCELLA: Wow! CODY: What a cool... BARNEY: Oh, it's amazing. ABBY: Look at all the furniture up there. BARNEY: Oh, wow. BARNEY: It's like a museum. -Oh, look at that. -Look at that. MARCELLA: Look over there. (ALL EXCLAIMING) GOLDFINCH: This is my library. And this is my collection of empty egg shells. Everything from hummingbirds to ostriches. Oh, egg-cellent. Well, if we wanna find out, we've surely come to the right place, haven't we? (CAWING) Excuse me. (SINGING) Can you tell us what's inside the egg? Tell us what it is BARNEY AND CHILDREN: Ms. Goldfinch, what's inside the egg? You are such a whiz! Please don't ask me, I can't even guess Hey, don't drop it! There'll be such a mess! BARNEY AND CHILDREN: When we found it, we were so impressed And we wonder what's inside it We can't see you, who's inside it? GOLDFINCH: Look around you, tell me what you see BARNEY AND CHILDREN: Miles and miles of books GOLDFINCH: Somewhere there we're sure to find the key CODY: We're no pile of schnooks! GIRLS: It's so gorgeous, really quite a catch And I wonder when it's gonna hatch Maybe this time, Cody's met his match I don't think so. BARNEY AND CHILDREN: And we wonder what's inside it We can't see you, who's inside it? It's so pretty with its colored ring I just hope it doesn't have a sting What if it's a horrid reptile thing? -Sorry, Barney. -Oops. That's okay. BARNEY AND CHILDREN: And we wonder what's inside it We can't see you, who's inside it? Maybe it's a baby chimpanzee Maybe it's a dinosaur like me! Maybe it's a fluffy little duck. So far, we aren't having any luck. Maybe it's a cousin of E.T.'s A tiny hummingbird! Cody, you are such a silly tease This is quite absurd ABBY: We are searching every single page Maybe we should put it in a cage. Maybe that might put it in a rage BARNEY AND CHILDREN: And we wonder what's inside it We can't see you, who's inside it? Don't you think that this is lots of fun? Dreams are fancy-free! CHILDREN: And I feel the fun has just begun Just you wait and see CODY: There's nothing here that we can find. MARCELLA: One more book and I'm going blind ABBY: But it seems that we don't really mind BARNEY AND CHILDREN: And we wonder what's inside it We can't see you, who's inside it? Let's make sure we don't run out of steam We must stick together as a team! Then we know we're sure to find our dream ALL: And we wonder what's inside it We can't see you, who's inside it? (TAPPING ON SHELL) That's funny. Okay, who's playing games here? Did you see what I saw? Yeah, I think I saw what you see. Forget the see-saw, that egg moved. ABBY: Whoa! Another ring is lighting up. ALL: Whoa! GIRLS: Oh, man! You have anything like that in one of your books? No. And we have looked in every single one. Wait a second. What's that? Oh, that old thing. I just use that book to keep the chair from wiggling. I don't even know its title. Maybe that's because it doesn't have a title. Barney! BARNEY: But there is a picture on the cover. Look! Well, what does it say? GOLDFINCH: It says that there is a dream-maker inside. -What? -Dream-maker? Come on! Well, what does a... A dream-maker look like? I don't know. A lot of pages are missing. What does it say? Every thousand years or so, an egg falls from the skies. Inside the shell, the dream-maker prepares its big surprise. A visitor from days gone by, who has a gift to share, for boys and girls around the world, for children everywhere. But mark you well, the very spot where first the egg is found. For when the colors, all have changed it must hatch on this ground. Barney, what does she mean? Well, the egg will hatch when all five of these rings light up. But it will only hatch in the very spot where Cody found it. In the barn. -Yeah. -Hovering hummingbirds, you are right. There's three more to go. Oh, you better get that egg back to the barn right away. Oh, come on, you are dreaming if you think that... Cody, be careful! BARNEY: Oh, no! -No! -No! -No. -No, no! -No. Stop. -No. CHILDREN: No. No! -Go, go, go. -CODY: I'm taking the fast way. See you, Ms. Goldfinch.

But we can't all ride on Agnes. Think I have an idea. Great. What is it? Voila! -All right! -Great idea. Okay, Agnes, it's all up to you. Just use your imagination. (HORSE NEIGHS) Okay. You expect a horse to use his imagination? A horse. Why, of course. -Wow! -Awesome! Oh, cool! How do you like it? Hi, ho, Agnes, away! Yahoo! (BLENDER WHIRRING) CODY: Yeah! BARNEY: Oh, boy! BABY BOP: Excuse me. I said, excuse me. Oh, that's better. I'm looking for my blankie. It's this big. And it's really, really soft, and it's yellow. Do you know where my blankie is?

You never did. -No, I... -It was crazy kid stuff. -Wait, no. -What's wrong with just being a kid, Cody? What's wrong with that? I... Cheer up, Abby. We'll find that egg.

MARCELLA: So, where do we go next? CODY: Come on, let's find the egg. Excuse me, bub. I heard about your little problem. Just what is it you're looking for? Well, it's a really big egg and... About this big? -CODY: Yeah, where is it? -I think I saw something like that. Let me see. Yup, there it is. Where? Clear over that way. By the balloons. -Oh, great. Thanks. -CHILDREN: Thank you, bye. Bye-bye. -Let's go, let's go. -Hurry. Oh, we might be able to catch it. CODY: Come on. BARNEY: Look. MARCELLA: They're balloons. BARNEY: Balloons. (BARNEY AND CHILDREN YELLING) Help, please. -Hey, come back. -Look, there's the egg. BARNEY: That's ring number four. Only one more to go. -CHILDREN: Come back! -Please. Oh, you can't take our egg. Come back. No. Now we are never gonna get it back in time. Yes, we will. It's gonna take some imagination. Right, Barney? (STUTTERS) -Right, yes. -What'd you say? Come on. Cody, did you really say imagination? Yeah, it's been kind of an unusual day, okay? Now, I think you should all climb abroad. Okay, all aboard the log. -Okay. -Okay. We're gonna pretend that this is the fastest, coolest airplane in the whole world. You think a log can fly? We gotta try. Okay, I will. Here goes. Prepared for take-off, Captain. Make believe, make believe. Flying with the wind in our hair. Come on. Flying should be easy. It's kid stuff. -Come on. -Faster. We can do this. We can. I think we need your help. I'd like you to pretend that we can really fly. Let's all do it together. Ready? One, two, three, now. It's working! Thank you. Yes. I don't know how to fly. -Oh, no. -Watch out! -BARNEY: Whoa! Look out! -(CHILDREN SCREAMING) BARNEY: Whoa, nice balloons. ANGRY BALLOON PILOT: Hey! Where you going? BARNEY: Excuse us, flying through. Excuse me. -Take us to the balloon! -It's hard. BARNEY: Hi, there. How you doing? (GIGGLING) Sorry! Whoa, nice flying, Cody. I could have done that with my eyes closed. In fact, I did. Hey, mister. Mister! ABBY: Mister, over here. ALL: Mister, look over here. MARCELLA: Mister, over here. -That's a splendid ship you're flying. -Thank you. But you have our egg. Egg? What egg? Where? Hanging off your balloon. Ah, that's my new ballast I just picked up. Gotta keep the old ship steady, you know. Yeah, but somehow our egg got mixed up with your ballast. What's ballast? See, I traveled all over the world, collecting things. This is the most beautiful egg I have ever seen. But if it's yours, you better have it back. -(CHILDREN CHEERING) -Position your craft under mine. All right. Good luck! GIRLS: Oh, no, he let it go too soon. BARNEY: Oh! Come on, Cody, get under it. -Faster, Cody, faster. -Hurry! I'm gonna break the sound barrier. BARNEY AND GIRLS: Faster! (CODY SCREAMS) BARNEY: We're almost there. Keep going. Come on! Gotta catch it. -Got it! Yeah! -That's it! (ALL CHEERING) Cody, the plane. (ALL SCREAMING) George, what is that? It won't pull up. (ALL SCREAMING) My stars, what happened? -Are you all right? -You kids okay? We're fine. We just had sort of a bumpy landing. Cody forgot to put landing wheels on his make-believe airplane. Hmm, wheels. Wheels would be good. What kind of game were you kids playing out here? We weren't exactly playing, Grandpa. And we weren't even here most of the time. See, we took that big old egg over to Ms. Goldfinch. The bird-lady. And her book said that it was a dream-maker and that we needed to bring it back to the farm. Only it took a ride on the truck and then Barney... The dinosaur. He helped us chase it but it rolled under a parade. So, we went to a French restaurant. But at the circus, the egg got tied to a balloon. Not a little balloon. CHILDREN: A big one. So, we made this log into an airplane... Slow down, children, children. Cody, I think you better start at the beginning. -The very beginning? -Yes. The very beginning. Okay, Grandma and Grandpa, I'd like you to meet a friend of ours. Barney the dinosaur. GRANDPA: Hey! Hey! Yes, I know. A lot of hay. (ALL GIGGLING) -Hi, Barney. -BARNEY: Hi, guys. What is it? Where did it come from? Look out below. Yahoo! Cool. Hi, guys, was that cool or what? Whoa! Hi, BJ. All right. -Did you see me, guys, huh? -GRANDPA: Hold it! Let's start over again. This is all about an egg? That's right. Hey, where is it? It's right here. Got away from us for a while, but we finally found it. Oh, my! What's it doing? BARNEY: The very last ring is lighting up. It's time for the dream-maker to hatch. Quick, Cody, you gotta put the egg back exactly where you found it. BARNEY: Hurry! Come on! The egg was right here in the... BARNEY AND GIRLS: Cody! No! Oh, look, I found my blankie. Yes. Pretty cool. ALL: Baby Bop, all right! Did I do something good? ALL: Yeah. Yeah. Whoa! BABY BOP: It's wiggling. (ALL EXCLAIM IN ASTONISHMENT) ALL: Wow! BARNEY: It's cracking. Looks like a rainbow. It's everywhere. It's hatching. MARCELLA: Come on! Oh, he's so cool. (EXCITED CHATTING) Oh, it's wonderful. It's a baby what? Pretty super! -Put him on my blankie. -BARNEY: Okay. There. -Here you go, little fellow. -Hello. (BOTH MURMURING EXCITEDLY) (GRUNTS) (GIGGLING) Hi there. Hi, what's your name? -(MUMBLING GRUNTS) -It's trying to tell us its name. -Oh. -Oh. Sounds like twinkle-twinkle. Twinken. What did you say, Twinkin? No, Twinken. Twinken, is that your name? Twinken. Twinken. Twinken, the dream-maker. Huh? Okay. GRANDPA: Oh! He's cute. Doesn't seem to do a whole lot, though, does he? He's a lot like you that way, George. (COOS) Hey, what are you doing? (COOS) (LAUGHS) Look, it's... It's me. BARNEY: Oh, Abby. Is this your dream? Yes. And I'm seeing it. GRANDPA: We all are. And I have never seen it so clearly. (LAUGHS) So, that's the dream-maker's gift. To let you see your own dreams more clearly. But why? Well, because the dreams you see most clearly are most likely to come true. Wow. Well, you are just full of surprises, aren't you? -BABY BOP: Lookie! -(COOS) Barney. Yes, Cody. I'd just like to say that... I was a big doofus before. And I think you are pretty cool. Thank you, Cody. I think you are pretty cool too. Hey, Barney, now can we see your dream? Hey, where's Twinken? We wanna see Barney's dream. He's gone? -Where is he? -I don't know. -Twinken. -Twinken. Here, Twinken. He ran away! Oh, no. GRANDMA: Where is he going? ALL: There he is. CODY: Look at that. What's Twinken trying to say, Barney? He's telling us, he knows what my dream is. It's a special time, a special place and sharing it all with the people I love. BABY BOP: Look! BARNEY: Wow. CODY: Did you see that? (LAUGHS) BJ: Oh, Barney, catch him. He's furry. I got you, little fellow. Oh, look. (SINGING) I love you, you love me We're a happy family With a great big hug and a kiss from me to you Won't you say you love me, too? Oh, he's so cute. ALL: I love you, you love me We're best friends like friends should be With a great big hug and a kiss from me to you Won't you say you love me, too? Barney, can I hold him? Oh, sure. -Golly. Oh, he's cute. -Be careful. He's furry. (SINGING) I love you, you love me We're a happy family With a great big hug and a kiss from me to you Won't you say you love me, too? Oh, that's nice. Yeah. But, speaking of dreams, I think it's time you were getting to bed. -Come on, Sissy. -Okay. Good night, everybody. Good night, Twinken. -See you later, guys. Bye. -Good night. Goodbye, Baby Bop. -So long, BJ. -Bye, see you later. -Goodbye, everybody. -See you, guys. BABY BOP: Hey, where's my blankie? Oh, there it is. (LAUGHS) Barney, this is a... Where is he? Now they are both gone. -Barney wouldn't just leave. -No. (GARBLED) Barney. (COOS) (INSPIRATIONAL SONG PLAYING) (CHEERFUL SONG PLAYING)
