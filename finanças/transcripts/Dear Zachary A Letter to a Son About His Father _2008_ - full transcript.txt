Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. - Charismatic. - Opinionated. I'd have to point out he was short. But he was a giant of a man. Really a good storyteller. He was completely selfless. - Animated. - Kind. - Jubilant. - Caring. - Devilish. - Laid-back, very approachable. Can I say things that are not completely flattering and wonderful? He had the capacity to have the worst possible gas. And he'd be proud of that. "Yep!" He wasn't a saint. He was a hell of guy. He was just so intelligent, and, um, I'm gonna cry. I'm sorry. Why are you sad? Why? Oh, I'll tell you about it someday. Do you know who that is? Andrew. Do you know who Andrew is? I don't know. Why did Andrew get killed? Because somebody hurt him, buddy. I'm an only child, and I'll get around to why this is of any importance whatsoever, but, trust me, there's a theme. Where were you when you found out? Melanie, who's on the front desk, calls back and says, "Kate, there's a policeman from Sunnyvale on the line for you. Do you want to talk to him?" And I said, "Oh, yes, put it through to the office." "Are you Kathleen Bagby?" I said yes. "I've got a message here from Pennsylvania. You're to call this number. It's the coroner's office. You've got bad news." I said, "Is my son dead?" And he said, "I can't tell you that, madam, but you've got terrible news." I dialed this number that he'd given me. And it was a man, an irate man. The coroner's office was closed down. There was nothing he could do about it. "You have to call back tomorrow morning." I called back to the Sunnyvale Police Station, so he gave me another number, and then I got through to Sgt. Krulac, and he said, "Your son is dead under suspicious circumstances. Have you got any idea why he was in the park?" I said, "My son is dead? Murdered?" He said yes. And then I called David. And I said to him, "Andrew's dead." And he said, "No!" And I heard him throw the phone. I called Sgt. Krulac back, and I said, "We're coming," and he said, "Well, that's good." Through that flight, we thought we'd go get Andrew, bring him back to California, get everything organized, whatever, and then kill ourselves, 'cause no point in going on. That was the first plan. Obviously, we didn't do that. And then she gave me the list to call, and we started calling. I came home, and there was a message from Barbara. - Kate called me. - It was Tuesday morning. I was just coming out of surgery. - I was doing something... - I was in the living room. How many people got a kick in the head from this? Everybody always says, "What would be the difference if one person weren't alive?" I came home on November 7, 2001, to find a message from my sister. Hi. It's Heather. It's about 9: 15. At 3:41 p.m., I called her back. She told me to sit down. In the original news, they said, "Unidentified man in his 30s was found in hospital scrubs." None of those words described who he was, and they could put them on paper and make them true. Nobody said, "This person, this wonderful person, was hurt." We met in first grade at St. Andrew's School in Saratoga, California, and I soon came to think of him as my closest friend. It was here, in the San Jose Bay Area, scattered across the suburbs that make up Silicon Valley, that we all grew up. There was Chris. Do I remember how I met Andrew? It was second grade. And Matt. I can say without shame that we bathed together. Michelle. He was the first friend I made my first day of school. Jon. We met the first day of class because of our names, Atkinson and Bagby. Olivier. We talked for about 20, 30 minutes, and I realized, "Wow, this guy's pretty cool." Heather. Oh, I'm sure you got to hear things I didn't get to hear. Between the two of us, we might actually be able to put together a half-decent story. And there was me. My name's Kurt, and I'm a filmmaker. I'm Kurt Kuenne, and I play Indiana Jones. He appeared in every movie I made growing up. We made a movie! He loved playing bad guys... Shut up! Jeff, get the cocaine. A's, huh? You must be a smart boy. ...and having a free pass to smoke and swear in front of his parents. I will fuck you up! Kiss my ass, you son of a bitch! Christ, start the fucking car and get out of here! Fuck you! Fuck all you fucking people! I did not say the F-word. I'm sorry. Which was probably kind of a cool release for a kid who made Eagle Scout by age 15. Mrs. Bagby, having watched it where Andrew was running around yelling and screaming, kind of went... I can't really remember being... "Oh, that's not my son!" Perhaps you have a different idea that I got all upset about it. "Not my son!" And, eventually, I even got them in on the act. Son of a bitch, you little shit! You're a pain in the ass. - You little bastard! - Does that give you the right to go yelling about your penis on the air? It wasn't always fun and games. - You son of a bitch! - Ow! Jesus! Did I actually hit you? - I didn't hurt your hand, did I? - Yes, but don't worry about it. And if you knee me in the balls again, I'm going to kill you. And I know I drove him nuts sometimes. Could you do that one more time? - One more time. - Okay, one more time. One more time. I want to see that one more time. That was perfect. The famous "one more time" line. If I hear him say "one more time" one more time, I'm gonna wring his neck! Jesus Christ, Kurt. What do you want? No, no. I'm just getting... But despite it all, he always supported me. Kurt, another winner! Yes! My God, what are you trying to do? Give our genius a heart attack? None of that. What, do we kiss now or... Oh! He even invested in my first feature film while he was working to save for medical school. Everything was perfect. I don't know what happened. We got bigger, and we got laid! At his memorial service, I talked with his med-school friend Anthony, who told me... One of the major things that Andrew and I did together, or that we had in common, was photography. I had no idea he took pictures, and I'd known him for 22 years. What else didn't I know? I was never going to get to visit him at his hospital and see what he was like as a doctor. I would never be going to his wedding where I would finally meet his entire family at the reception. He would never be telling me anything I didn't already know about him. So I decided to make this movie, to travel far and wide, to interview everyone who ever knew and loved him, to learn everything there was to know, and to make one last movie with him. I had no idea how many years it would take or how I would even know when I was done. But the longer I waited, the more memories would be lost. So I started at home in California, and, as soon as I could, I grabbed a camera. Okay, Andrew, ready? - And said... - Action! How would I describe Andrew to someone who had never met him? The man never wore pants. He only wore shorts. That's right. Constantly! Well, Andrew was very good at pool. Quite frankly, he was a pool shark, is what he was. Well, he had a good teacher. When we first met him, he had this thing with his fingernails. Oh, yeah, he'd always bite his fingernails. They looked like they'd been through a shredder. Too late. He was probably the most determined person I've ever met about doing a particular profession. His mom worked in the business, so... We would sit and discuss a topic like venereal disease. He didn't get an offer to come to medical school at the end of the first year. I remember that was a big downer. I think he felt like he wasn't... like things were kind of stalled for him and he wasn't really... he wasn't living up to expectations. "Well, what are you gonna do?" "Okay, I'll get a job, and I'll apply again." Okay. That's problem, solution. And then, of course, Heather brought home this application she had picked up from Memorial University of Newfoundland. I had to go look up St. John's on the map when he got accepted there. I knew, "That's over in the east coast." He's now engaged to this lovely girl, and he's gonna go to med school. It was great. Graduation, he was in shorts. Hold on a second. We'll come back to this. But before we go any further, you've got to know what happened. The whole truth. So here it is. A couple of policemen met us at the airport in Pittsburgh. Took us over to the hospital. Bill and Clark picked us up and took us over to Bacha's Funeral Home in Greensburg. And then he took us down a stairway. Gurney at the other end... with a white sheet over a body. And... ...went over to him and when we could see his face... ...I said, "It's really him." I kissed him and held him, and Kate kissed him and held him and kissed him some more. Tears are dropping on him, of course, and Kate went to wipe one of those away off his cheek, and a plug came out where he'd been shot in the left cheek. Oh, God. She pushed it back in and cried some more. After that, I lost it. I just ran outside and screamed. I was so fucking mad, I couldn't see straight. God damn it, I hated. I've never hated like that. Didn't even know who I hated. Didn't know who it was then. Just knew that somebody purposely put him there. Whoever that is is a monster. Well, who hurt him? A very bad person. Which bad person? - A lady? - Mm-hmm. What's her name? Shirley. Shirley? Why'd she kill him? I couldn't figure out who she was in relation to Andrew since Andrew talked a lot about women but never really mentioned her. Collette, this is Bagby's new girlfriend. Makes me sick to my stomach now, but I was so excited that he was dating somebody. Come on, Shirley. Get out from behind him. I knew he'd been struggling with me moving on and dating other people. - Or maybe you will. - You already met me! I was excited at the thought that maybe he had found somebody that he, you know, could really be happy with. But it didn't turn out that way. - Did you know her? - Yeah. Do you remember when they started dating? Mm-hmm. She just kind of appeared, and then she was there all the time all of a sudden. And just didn't seem suited for him. He did say that there was a considerable age difference. And then the second time I heard him talk about it, he actually fessed to the age difference, and I was like, "Holy shit!" Shirley's got three kids! Whoo-hoo! Me, I always had to give him a hard time, so I'd tease him about nailing grandma. And she seemed so incongruous with who I would picture him with. A person like that isn't just, like, completely normal and then, one day, they become a psycho, you know? I mean, there had to be some signs. She'd just be really inappropriate with things. Poor taste, things that she would say. She was always making sexually inappropriate comments. But never threatening. We never thought of her as being threatening, but, just, something was a little off. Something wasn't right. She started calling me on a regular basis. She talked forever. Crude things about their intimate relationship. But I thought it was kind of odd when I met her that she was not practicing. She had finished residency for quite some time, and yet she was having trouble getting her credentials. Nobody said anything 'cause we all respected Andrew. And if he wasn't putting the pieces together or something, it just makes me think he was just not caring. He was likely 4,000 miles away from where he wanted to be for the rest of his life. He had had a very difficult, kind of heartbreaking type of situation with Heather. Whatever happened with their breakup really kind of devastated him and just left him vulnerable to someone like Shirley. "Andrew! You know you can do a lot better." He said, "Ah, no, I really can't." He'd poke fun at himself all the time. He'd say he was a short, portly little fella. You don't need to go out with a woman because you can't think you can do better. It was a comfort. And, in Newfoundland, it was somebody to be around and he enjoyed it. Oh, it's just a senior-year thing. After graduation, he came back to the U.S. to do a surgery residency in Syracuse, New York, and he was miserable. He hated it. Shirley also decided to move to the States to practice. We were not very aware of his year in Syracuse, what a problem she became to him there. Was a real hard year for him. There was really no time for anything. And the fact that there was this somebody that was making a lot of effort to maintain a relationship with him and represented something else besides the misery that it sounded like his internship was was hard for him to pass up. He pretty quickly realized that surgery wasn't for him and switched to a family-practice residency in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, in July of 2001. And he loved it. He said, "When you finally find that thing that you know is your niche, it's worth everything in the world." And he now wanted her to go away. He did not invite her to Matt's wedding. Yeah, and she thought she was going to be coming. She just already had it arranged. The morning of the wedding, Andrew's cellphone started ringing. And he'd answer it, and it's Shirley. A minute or two later, it'd ring again, and it's her again. Andrew got more and more upset with her. "What is your fucking problem?" And he clicked off the phone. She left 30-some-odd messages on his phone. His phone in his house rang, like, 30 times. Then his cellphone rang 30 times. He's like, "Oh, it's her. I don't want to talk with her." Apparently, Andrew had already asked Shirley to accompany him to Karl and Marci's wedding, October 20th, before July. He had broken up with her a month before in his mind. It sounds so easy, but it's hard when you're a genuine person who cares. He didn't know how to be a son of a bitch because he wasn't a son of a bitch. Shirley had been really, like, all over Andrew. Just acting possessive of him. I said, "Andrew, hey, do you want something to drink?" and she said, "There you go, hitting on the best man." My jaw dropped. It had to have. I remember going... On the afternoon of Saturday, November 3, 2001, he broke up with Shirley once and for all over lunch at the airport in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. Then he put her on a plane back to her place in Council Bluffs, Iowa, 1,000 miles away. I remember the morning that Shirley showed up. He said, "You'll never guess who showed up on my doorstep at 5:30." And I said, "Who?" He said, "The psychotic bitch." And I told him, I said, "You know, Andrew, when I break up with somebody and put them on a plane and send them 1,300 miles away, they knock on my front door, I'm going out the back door and I'm calling the police." He said, "What do you mean?" I said, "Andrew." I said, "Be serious. Nobody drives 16 hours after you've just broken up with them." I said, "Do not meet her in private." He said, "What can happen?" And he said, "I'm gonna need to catch up with you and we're gonna have to do some serious talking." I said, "Bring some beer. I only live a block away. When do you think you'll be done?" He said, "Well, it's 4:30 now. Meeting her at 6:00. 7:30, I'll be at your house." Things people should know about Andrew. He was never late. And you know what? When Andrew didn't show up at 7:30, I knew something was very wrong. And when I went back down at 9:00 and didn't see his car there... I knew something was wrong. Well, let me tell you the events of the day. Andrew didn't show up for morning report. Morning report ended around 8:00. I went down to my office. I called Andrew's house. Hi. You've reached Andrew Bagby. Please leave a message at the tone. Thank you. Called his cellphone. "Andrew, where are you at?" No answer on either one. As I recall, we're getting pretty close to 9:00 in the morning, and Rhonda and I and some of the residents are starting to get a little nervous. I remember Bill coming in and standing in front of the television and telling us. One of the E.R. docs turned to me and said, "They found a body in scrubs out at Keystone Park." Dead silence fell over. A heaviness like I've never felt. And eventually almost everyone was congregated there just waiting for more news. Rhonda got the call, and she said to me, "They need you in Mr. Clark's office right now." And I remember my heart pounding, going up at damn near a sprint. I opened the door, and I remember seeing three Pennsylvania State Police troopers in uniform sitting in the room. And I said, "You're here to tell me about Andrew Bagby." They asked for us all to gather in the conference room. - And they closed the door. - He cleared his throat. He just walked right up to the podium and he said... "Andrew Bagby is dead." I said, "Well, hell, you don't have to look far." They're like, "What do you mean?" I said, "This woman was in town. She was here." I said, "Find her, and I think you'll find who did this." A summary of the evidence against Shirley Turner. He was found on the morning of Tuesday, November 6th, laying behind his car in a parking lot at Keystone State Park in Derry Township, Pennsylvania. A man walking through Keystone Park at 6: 10 p.m. the previous evening, November 5th, had seen his black Toyota Corolla parked next to an SUV. This was 10 minutes after he told Clark he was going to meet Shirley. "Meeting her at 6:00." Shirley drove a Toyota RAV4 SUV. He was shot five times. In the face, the chest, twice in the buttocks, and in the back of the head. He also received a blunt trauma to the back of the head. That didn't sound random. That sounded like rage and vengeance. The ammunition used was CCI.22-caliber bullets. There were six spent casings and one live round on the ground beside him. Shirley owned a Phoenix Arms .22-caliber handgun. She had three lessons with a firearms instructor who said that at her last lesson she was using CCI.22-caliber ammunition and her gun malfunctioned and would sometimes eject live rounds onto the ground. Then she said, "No, I can't find it." Then she said, "I gave the gun to Andrew." She claimed she was home sick all day on Monday, November 5th. The cellphone records show that a phone call was made here, here, here, and here. While she claims to be home in bed, she's making cellphone calls from Chicago, Illinois, at 7:08 and 7: 10 p.m. on Sunday, November 4th. Then another from South Bend, Indiana, at 10: 19 p.m. that night. Then another from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at 8:07 a.m. the next morning, November 5th, the day he was killed. She logged on to eBay that morning from his computer at his house. And back again. At 11:26 p.m. that night, she makes another call from Cleveland, Ohio, clearly on her way home this time. Then another call from Stuart, Iowa, at 9:48 a.m. the next morning, Tuesday, November 6th. Then another once she got home to Council Bluffs. And this one's to him. But when she realized that she couldn't possibly be sick in bed when she'd been caught making cellphone calls from Pennsylvania and back, she changed her story again. Then she said, "I gave the gun to Andrew in the parking lot, and I saw him put it in his trunk." And that clearly shows if she did this, she planned it. She is a manipulative, deceitful planner of a murder. In order to prove her whereabouts when she made these phone calls, each individual cell tower along her 16-hour drive had to be manually checked, which was a process that took almost two weeks. While the police were uncovering this crucial piece of evidence, Shirley left the United States for her home in St. John's, Newfoundland. We were absolutely helpless for the whole time we were in Latrobe after this initial nightmare. The other residents and Andrew's... They're Andrew friends now... came in, sat with us, brought us meals. They had a sign-up sheet at the hospital to bring us a dinner and sit and cry with us and listen to us and cry some more. Great people. The whole hospital grieved. It was profound. Just picture the masses that just came out for that. From memorials in Newfoundland to California to England. - To St. Louis. - To Latrobe. I'm so proud to say that I loved him so very much. I'd be happy if I had 1/10 the people care 1/2 about me as much as they did Andrew. I know at the point we had the memorial service, she was back in Canada. She was there at the memorial service that we had here. She broke down crying during the service and sobbing really loud, and, you know, I wonder if it wasn't all just for a show. And then fear at that point for, you know, Heather's safety. She came up and sort of butted one of my friends out beside me and said just awful things and, obviously, I cared a lot more about him than he ever cared about me. And I definitely wasn't important in his life. Got an e-mail from Shirley. A horrible, scathing e-mail. It was all basically, I was nothing, and she was everything. How wonderful their love was and how that'll never die now. To try to lure her back to the United States, Shirley was invited to the memorial service in California, but she didn't take the bait. So, finally, she was charged. She was arrested in St. John's, Newfoundland, on December 12, 2001, and was let go on bail the very same day. And then this flight risk. It seemed to me common sense that if she isn't in the jurisdiction where they want her, she's fled. Crown Prosecutor Mike Madden did not even argue against her release on bail and instead entered the courtroom with an agreement already in place for her release. Pending the next hearing in the extradition process to the United States, all Justice David Russell required Shirley to do was post $75,000 in sureties. $65,000 of this was posted by her personal psychiatrist, but I'll come back to him. Turn in her passports, sign in once a week at the local police station, promise not to leave Newfoundland, and avoid contact with these people. And with that, the government of Canada let a probable pre-meditated first-degree murderer walk the streets. - I thought it was crazy. - Should never be. - Should never have been. - I thought it was insane. Who the hell is the system protecting? I could not believe this was happening. But the most unbelievable part was when we found out about you. Kurt, this is Matt Oetinger. I just got a call from Mrs. Bagby. The abbreviated version is what's her bucket, that bitch, held a press conference and announced she's 4 months pregnant with Andrew's baby. They can't prove it until the child's born. If it is true, the Bagbys are going to sue for custody. My movie now took on a whole new meaning. It was no longer just my search for what was left of your dad. It might be the only way you could one day go back in time, see, and get to know him. This is a time machine. Yes. A time machine. And I vowed to collect every memory for you before they were gone. So, finally, I set off. First, I would go to England to interview your grandma's side of the family for you. Then I'd return to the U.S. to do an epic road trip across North America. I'd start on the west coast of California and motor east, stopping to interview all of your dad's friends and family along the way. And I would keep driving until the land ran out in St. John's, Newfoundland, the eastern-most point in all of North America, where the last living piece of Andrew, you, would be waiting for me. I grabbed a digital video camera, a 16mm wind-up movie camera, and an old Nikon. I have a good idea. I'll go back in time and stop you from dying. And set off on a quest to bring your dad back to life. And while I raced to rescue your history, your grandma and grandpa quit their jobs, dug into their savings, and gave up everything to move to Newfoundland to fight for your future. I met Kate and David in the spring of 2002. I'll never forget it. They needed a lawyer to assist them in making sure that their rights and the baby's rights were protected, I guess. I instantly liked them. I thought that it was so important that they have a relationship with that child. Our lawyer Jackie went to see Betty Day, an administrator somewhere in the hierarchy of Child Protective Services, and told her that we, the Bagbys, are concerned about the safety of the baby because the mother is accused of a pre-meditated murder. To me, I thought they were very emotionally intelligent in how they were bearing up under all of this incredible stress. You know, that was a Sunday afternoon. The next morning, they had to sit in the courtroom and look at her. When your grandma and grandpa first arrived in Canada, they were told, "The law is slow." And they weren't kidding. February 15th. Prosecutor Mike Madden acknowledged that the extradition request had been received. They adjourned until March 11th, when they decided they'd reconvene to select a date for the extradition hearing on March 25th, where they decided to set the date for the extradition hearing for May 27th, where they got caught up debating the French-versus-English translations of Section 32 of the Extradition Act, and decided to adjourn for a specific translation until June 11th, a hearing which lasted five minutes, at which Judge Derek Green said he wasn't in a position to rule on the translation and they would adjourn again until July 30th. And while they waited for justice and for you to arrive, your grandma and grandpa made a new home and new friends. They made friends all over St. John's. People in the legal community, the medical community. But here at St. Michael's, yeah, they got right in there and got right involved. It seems like they've always been here. Basically, they have more friends in Newfoundland now than we do. Well, it's a very small province. The land mass is as big as... Well, maybe not quite as big as California, but not far off. And yet we only have 530,000 population scattered over that land mass. You can't go anywhere in St. John's without running into somebody you know. I mean, it's the oldest city in North America. It's a very safe place, I think. The big drawback against living here is getting out of here. The weather here is terrible. The weather is awful. We have 8 months of winter and 4 months of bad weather. And the other very consistent thing that I hear is that the people are so friendly. How would you describe them to someone who had never met them before? Oh, do you have an hour? I was hoping you would ask me about Kate and David, who are very... Young at heart. Childish. That's not the right word. He's an engineer in the truest sense of the word. The guy likes Pintos, okay? Logical. Does things in steps, logical steps. Comparing Andrew as a teenager and Dave as a teenager, - they're almost twins. - He's the older model. - It was wonderful. - It was wonderful. He always calls you "mate," his father does."Mate." "How you doing, mate?" And Kate calls you "love." Oh, I thought she was feisty. Like a little ball of fire. She's so tiny, and then big things come out of her. It's great if she's on your side because she'll always stand up for what she believes in and those that she loves. They're a rare pair. They were from the start. In itself, it's quite a story, their marriage, you know. I was going to come here for the two years, then I was going on to Australia for two years, work my way around the world. And then I was going back to Devon. And I wasn't going to get married because that was not on my list of things to do at all. I was in the Navy, stationed on an aircraft carrier, the Hornet, in Long Beach, California. A guy came into the shop one day, E.T., electronics shop, and said he had two English nurses who wanted to go to Disneyland. We were too cheap to pay the fare. Yeah, two cheap English nurses. And I took the little one and left him with the tall one. And, uh, they didn't work out so well, but we did. We went out 13 times in the first two weeks. And he could quote Shakespeare, by the way, so I knew it was all right. Five months later, I'm married. So we moved down to San Diego and started working on a baby. But nothing happened. We tried to get pregnant for a year, two years, with no result. At some point, they mentioned that they might adopt. And then, I mean, it was like a miracle. Coming to St. Louis and sleeping in my mother's bedroom seemed to make people pregnant. And then, of course, Andrew didn't come. He was two weeks late. Things people should know about Andrew. He was never late. Hi. It's Heather. It's 9:00 Thursday. Shirley went into labor around 3:00 in the afternoon, Newfoundland time. On July 18, 2002, you were born. Shirley named you Zachary Andrew Turner. You grandma and grandpa came to the hospital to see you, but Shirley wouldn't let them in the door. The stood five feet away from you on the other side of a wall. They left a gift for you. Well, your dad was an amazing person. You're gonna get such a broad range of different perspectives of this guy. You're gonna know what his character was like and you're gonna know what fun he was to be with and you're gonna know that you can be proud of him. I flew to England to collect the memories of your grandma's side of the family for you and arrived just in time for a very special occasion. Well, we're on the eve of my wedding, for a start. It's been a bit hectic. We're just trying to fit this interview in between all of the preparations. Your dad crossed the Atlantic to come here almost every summer, but instead of heading to the tourist attractions in London like everyone else, he'd head to the outskirts to spend time with his grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. He was a king to me, man. Seriously, man. And, in particular, with his cousin John. The main thing, I guess, about being an only child is that I get to choose my brothers. Others of you don't. Sorry. John, me brother, and Andrew were born within a month of each other. In fact, I think it was about 30 seconds of the normal child, "Who are you? Who are you?" And then suddenly, snap, that was it. We often said at least they would have each other through life. John would always have Andrew, and Andrew would always have John. For me, kind of blur into this haze of me and Andrew running around castles, country homes, gardens. I mean, these fantastic historical places. And, to us, they were places to play hide and seek, buy water pistols, shoot each other, and then get told off and thrown out. The interesting thing always was, just like the cultural differences between someone coming from the U.S. and someone in the U.K. That used to really bug me, the fact that I knew he was going to get "Star Wars" kind of 6 months before me, that was a killer. 'Cause, you know, it'd be like, "Don't you dare tell me anything about this film!" He was almost kind of, as well, my kind of chaperone into discovering the U.S., really. You hear people discriminate against a whole country just in one fell swoop. But I was fortunate enough to know very differently to that. I really cherish that, because it is my brother that got married here tonight. Bizarrely enough, one of the things is I always wanted Andrew to be my best man at my wedding.
