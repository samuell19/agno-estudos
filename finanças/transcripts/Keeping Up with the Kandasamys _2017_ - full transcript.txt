[tranquil Indian music] Durban... beautiful isn't it? Hmm... [indistinct] But you think... this is the real Durban. Oh no, no, no, no, no. Let me take you... to the real deal. [upbeat drums] [upbeat Indian music] You see... many years ago... the government took us, all the Indian people, and put us in one place. They named it... Chatsworth. Ahh, just a place in England. Hmm... what the bloody cheek? But never mind they did like that. We struggle and struggled instead. [upbeat Indian music continues] Only one thing hey... the houses are so close to each other. The neighbors are so nosey they become like our extended family. I'm just lying man... not all of them. You see these two here... they used to be best friends. But now... oh! [upbeat Indian music continues] Desan, Preggie, I'm back! Which idiot plans a morning wedding... - I love morning weddings. - Moron. Oh darling another call. Modern recreations, Marlin speaking. You know [indistinct]. She's in the back... and I'm in the front. Oh no, I know full well not to put the Naidoos and Kandasamys together. [Marlin] It's all sorted... okay? Bye. Arsevan. I said aqua blue, not sky blue. [Marlin] Hmm... Ey, this Arsevan I tell you... His name says it all. [Marlin laughs] [Indian music] [Indian music continues] [groans] How is it? Come with me honey. [groans and laughs] Not now my hair. [Indian music continues] [Indian music fades] Preston... you ready? You nervous? You going to practice? Morning Ma. I ironed five shirts. Go quickly and choose one. I don't want to be late, I don't want to be late... to clean up. She means she wants to get there before the Kandasamys do. Ey... cool hairstyle bro. [Indian music continues] [car engine] [Indian guitar music] [Indian guitar music continues] [Indian guitar music continues] My Sari... she's wearing my Sari. Get in the car man. [Indian guitar music continues] [Shanti]The lady said it was a designer Sari. [Shanti]She said it was a designer Sari now that one is wearing it. She is wearing my Sari. [soft Indian music] She actually thinks she can pull it off. [soft Indian music continues] [indistinct chatter] - You close the front door? - Yes man. - What about the alarm? - I did that. - You put the iron off? - Oh shit. [engine revving] No, no, no, I put the iron off. - Yeah I put it off. - You sure? Yes! Can't believe she had my Sari on. [Indian music continues] [Indian music fades out] Prishen... Preggie. Come this side. [laughter] [indistinct chatter] - Howzit Elvis? - Howzit Pregs? - Preggie. - [Preggie] Hi everyone. Come, come sit by us. Ma, they can't sit here. These seats are allocated. Same thing I was thinking, sit, sit. You don't seem to understand. Allocated means they are reserved for other people. Hey, I know what allocated means. I'm old... not stupid. Read there. Make yourselves comfortable. Sit, sit. I am going to kill that Marlin. So nice hey... we are all sitting together like one happy family. [man on microphone] Ladies and gentlemen. Please rise as we welcome the wedding recession. [chair noises] Preggie, where is Shanti and Des? Where is your mother? [Indian music starts] [Indian music continues] [Indian music continues] [Indian music stops] How are you Aya? I'm counting on Shanti what to do. Who will make it to eighty? - One leg in the grave. - Shame Aya, don't say that. I'm sure you didn't eat in the last 10 minutes? Try them! So what did you think of the bride and groom? They looked so cute together. You want to talk you together? You look like two twins only. Don't be ridiculous ma... our bodies wear the Sari's in completely different styles. Yeah the one has curves and the other one is cold and long with no shape. She should have bought two Sari's and sown them together. Hmm... I rather die than look like a toothpick. Hmm.. now there's some idea. Oh you think I must die? Hey why don't you take out your cell phone? Well take one nice picture together. What you call it. Selfie? Don't be silly ma... she won't fit. [gasps] [soft background music] [indistinct chatter] [Elvis] How's our two ek se? They don't even know how to behave at a wedding... sis man. I was getting heartburn then I started chowing. But you know... when I saw those nametags... I just knew we were in trouble bro. -[all laugh] -But hey, we mustn't get involved in that. Ja, cheers to that! [all] Cheers guys. [all cough and laugh] Hey what did you pour in here? [sighs] [soft happy music] [girl laughs] [happy music continues] This is going straight to charity. [social media notification alerts beeping] [chuckles] Who you talking to? A friend from campus. Boy? Yeah, boy... a friend. [laughs] - Boyfriend. - [laughs] Ma... If I had a boyfriend, you'd be the first to know. [machine whirring] [blender stops] What was that? No you, you carry on... Here's your coffee. But I asked for tea. You know you really need to sort your mother out. She's old love, just give her a break. Yes Saris, I'm 79 years old. Anytime I'm going to go. Sometimes... I even see a white light. Plus with the cataracts and all... See what a drama queen she is. Normally I can put up with her nonsense. But my ears are still fine. You see? The pressure is not coming down. I must give you Sushi's pressure tablets. [Elvis] Ma... I told you not to use other people's medication. [Jennifer] That boys car is literally falling apart. So cheap and embarrassing. Can't believe we actually allow our daughter to drive in that. - It's not safe. - You don't remember doll? You used to drive in your father's old trusty Valiant? [Elvis] Besides he's giving her a ride. He's giving her a ride alright. Let me go, Sadis. My sugar's feeling low... feeling a bit dizzy. [Ma] I need one sweet. Jen... Jen... Jennifer! The milk. [water burning] [soft Indian music] [Indian music continues] [Indian music fades] Ugh, hah! You're such a punk. What do you have for me? You know my mother. Wait, how much time do we have? About five minutes. Only five? I could push it to ten? Okay? Oh here... enjoy. Wow! - Your favorite. - Yum! [Prishen sighs] I thought the wedding was great. I thought so. It did get pretty interesting. You couldn't keep your hands to yourself, could you? Excuse me. [laughs] You were all over me. Mr... I'm so shy. I couldn't stop myself. I want to kiss you the moment I saw you. This looks delicious. You were delicious. Just eat your food. Like you would've kissed me anyway in front of all those people. Your mother... would have fainted. [happy Indian music] [happy Indian fades] How's it moving in? Oh too good. You taught him that. No, my baby's a natural. Pity about the food, hey Shanti? Oh, tasteless. I didn't even get one potato in my biryani. Luckily... Marlin did such a top job with the wedding. [laughs] Now you sound like Jennifer. And you wore the same Sari too. Only thing she looked like was a stick insect. That one is like an ironing board, you know that? [soft Indian music] [snip] Uhm... uhm... Basi, uhm... just check over here and check what is happening. Don't touch me. What are you doing here? Well, certainly didn't come here for a haircut. Well you obviously came here for something. Obviously. Hey, I'm not going to say this again. What are you doing here? Don't rush me. I'll speak when I'm ready. You got two minutes before my pun turns into an afro. Listen, you just tell your miserable useless son to stay away from my daughter. Excuse me missy, my son has got taste. - Don't talk shit man. - I saw Prishen kissing Jody at the wedding. Kissing? Groping her sticking his tongue down her throat. I mean who the hell does your son think he is? -Hey, Hey! If your son wants to mess with my daughter, he's going to have me. Don't come here with your lies. Why would I come to this place, of all places, to make up lies about my own daughter. Think idiot! Because my Prishen tells me everything. Obviously leaving out all the juicy bits, isn't he? You know what why don't you take yourself and your juicy bits... And voetsek from here! Fine! And be careful you don't trip on that skirt. [groans] Hello ma... who is it you chopping off? [sighs] So, you going to gym? Yeah! I'm cooking all your favorites. - All my favorites? - Yeah. You know someday I'll have to teach your wife all of this. Plenty of time for that. [kiss] Prishen... - Love you. - [Prishen] Love you too ma. [mystical music] [inhales] Come Shanti. Love, light, peace. Love, light, peace. [music continues] [Indian drum music] Where's the buttons on this phone? [recorded voice] Sorry I do not understand. [recorded voice] Where are the buttons on this phone? Hello? [recorded voice] Hello sexy Prishen. Who you? [recorded voice] I am Simmy, how may I help you? Oh, okay... please can I see all the messages that this Jodi girl from next door is sending my son? [recorded voice] Thank you, I can definitely assist. [recorded voice] Are you looking for... [recorded voice] A - A message. B - a Phone lock. [recorded voice] or C - both options? Stop asking so many questions. Fat lot of help you are. [recorded voice] I do not understand. [recorded voice] Fat lot of help you are. [recorded voice] I am Simmy, how may I help? You know what Sivvy, Selby or whatever your name is... why don't you shut your mouth and stay away from my son, you wild thing. [recorded voice] I do not understand. [Indian music continues] [recorded voice] Stay away from my son, you wild thing. [telephone voice] Shame man Saris. [Jennifer coughs] This smoke is driving me insane. Jodi... How can you sit through this? It's not that bad. [telephone voice still speaking] So Jodi... How was lectures today? Fine. Can I make you some tea? [Jodi makes 'no' sound] Anyway Saris, let me go. My sugars feeling low. I need one sweet man. - Ok bye! - Ma... Shouldn't you be watching your blood sugar levels? Whose body is this? Mine or yours? [crackling wrapper] Here, have one sweet. Add some flavor to your life. Hmm, so bland this is. Must be sugar free. Taste so familiar. Ma... Where did you get this from? Jodi's bag. Not all she got. [zips opening] [crackling wrappers] Hmm, these taste terrible. [rubber squeaking] Now I know what that thing taste like. Coconut oil. It's coconut oil! That's what I said. Coc-nut-oil! [distressing music] [music continues] To Mr. Shy Guy. LOL. [music continues] [husband calling] Lovey? You deaf or what, you can't hear the phone ring? Phone? No, no, no, no. I never hear no phone. - What's wrong? - Nothing strong... I mean wrong. Nothing's wrong. I'm coming just now. Just go downstairs and wait for me I'm coming, I'm coming. [sighs] [anticipatory music] [flute music] [music stops] Your rotten daughter thinks she's already married to my son. You think that's bad. I found these... in Jodi's bag. It means they having sex Shanti. Don't put that thing by me. Oh my God, my poor son. Your poor son... your poor son is a scoundrel, that's what he is. Hello? I see how your daughter dresses. She looks like a damn tramp. Buying all these fancy underwear, carrying condoms in a bag. And, look at this. Look at this. Look at where the "J" is. Look! See, it's right by the thing. Huh? Sis man. Your daughter's a witch. You are a crazy woman, you know that? You absolutely lost your mind. You going looney. That's what it is. I don't even know what she sees in your son. My son is the picture of innocence. Innocence my foot. Instead of sitting here blabbing your mouth have you thought about the fact that she could fall pregnant? Oh my God! Imagine if that baby comes out like you. [Indian suspense music] Oh my gosh. Or it can turn out like you. Baby's first words would be... [makes baby voice] I'm hungry! Fat jokes, fat jokes. You still on the fat jokes? You know what? I can't take this anymore, rubbish woman. [crackling paper bags] Shanti, if you and I don't do something about this now... your precious Prishen will have to drop out of medical school and be changing stinky nappies. Is that what you want? [crackling paper bags] And, you and I will be sharing a grandchild. [Indian music continues] Let's tell Marlin about us. [laughs] No way. Come on I have to tell someone, I'm dying. And you want to tell Marlin? Okay. [waves crashing] What's this? Open it. Is it a matching thong? [laughs] You are mad. Just open it. [waves crashing] It's adorable. Thank you. [waves crashing] [electronic song played by bear] [laughs] It's our song. When do you leave for Cape Town? - Is it next semester? - I'm not going. What do you mean? Well... I applied for this last year... and since then things have changed. - You can't do this for me. - I've already said no. - No, I won't let you. - It's too late now. [laughs] [upbeat love song] [record scratches] I knew it! Oh shit! What do your mothers think of this? Hashtag [indistinct], You going to die. You can't tell anyone about us. Guys... I can't keep something so big inside me. [all laugh] [Jennifer and Elvis laugh] Why are you laughing? Come on babe. You must be joking Jen? No, I'm not joking. This is not a laughing matter. We need to be more proactive. You hear all kinds of horror stories about kids these days. - [Elvis] Ugh. - She needs our support babe. So... you want me to speak to Jodi about the birds and the bees? - Yup! - You don't think she's too old? You just have to be straight up with her. Okay... Is my Chamois ready? [Jennifer] Yeah... got it. Listen, if parents were straight up and told it like it is... - Yeah? - they will save themselves a lot of trouble. - So you want me to be straight up with Jodi? - Uh huh. [laughs] Tell it like it is, hey? So should I use words like... penetration and so? - [Elvis laughs] - Elvis what is wrong with you? - [Elvis laughs] - How can you say that? Listen, you know what youngsters get up to these days? Oh... the same thing we got up to when we were young. -[Elvis laughs] -Elvis stop, your mother is going to see. So now you are shy of my mother? Hey, you know if your dad's back seat could tell us a few stories. Come on, babe listen I'm serious. -[Elvis sighs] -I'm really serious, I'm really worried about her. Asheel was such a great guy. He used to go to Temple, He was so responsible. Great family. He was a gem. Look... Jodi is responsible. She's a mature person. She'll make the right decision when the time is right. [cellphone rings] Who knows what kind of guys out there? [cellphone continues ringing] Howzit Dylan. So, I'm Dylan again? What wrong bro? You can't talk? Yeah, you know it right. Hello auntie Jennifer. No, like tomorrow. The same job bro. Where she's turning? Next year. She got you under? [laughs] [Shanti] Who got who under? No, I'm talking to Dylan man. His wife is killing him with the divorce. Oh... Please tell Dylan he must send my containers. Hey, you heard what my wife said? No, I heard. Tell her I'll return it... But maybe tomorrow. Alright... check you Dylan. Check you Dylan. No... Check you Dylan. [drum beat music] [Jennifer] So... did you come up with anything? Yeah... point number one. Send Jodi to India. Can you please be serious? Ow... she can be the next Mother Teresa. You know that story about Ronnie's dau... [crunch] [continues crunching] Well so... Ronnie's daughter, when they found out about... [continues crunching] Can you please stop crunching and munching all the time? I can't even hear myself think. When they found out about Ronnie's daughter, and her boyfriend... they broke his legs. Why don't you all just move? I mean you don't even like Chatsworth. Alright, we'll move and then you'll follow us like a little puppy dog as usual wherever we go. Whatever. Anyway. Elvis won't leave his mother and that old bag will never leave Chatsworth. Oh ok. I thought we agreed to work together? - I said ok. - Right... so we need to do this in a very logical systematic manner. Okay. So... we need to start thinking clearly... about what we are going to do. [liquid shaking] And well go from there. [soft drum beats] [pouring liquid] [mumbles] [drum beat continues] What now? I don't know. You don't know what? Ahh... I don't know what you're talking about. I know what we need to do. [crunch] We should make a list but make a list. Make a list of all their likes and dislikes. [continues crunching] And the first one... the first one would be... her ex. - Ex. - Asheel. [guitar strum] [upbeat Indian drum music] [upbeat Indian music continues] [Indian singing with music] [singing and music continue] [music fades] [all laughing] [indistinct chattering] Hey Shanti... so big he's got. Shame you remember auntie Prizzy? - Hello Auntie. - How... you forgot me. You don't remember how I used to wash your toweling napkins when you were small? And that's uncle Cobian. Howzit? And this is Diwani. - Hello. - Hello. You know Preggie... the way I used to wash your napkins when you were small. So slow that water used to come up. [Jennifer] Here you go everybody, help yourselves. Oh, let me see what Jennifer made. Hmm... Jennifer these cupcakes you made are delicious. I just quickly threw them together. You must give me the recipe. Jennifer is too sharp in the kitchen. She can win MasterChef. All the Indians are winning the thing only. I'll get you a pen and page... so she can write the recipe for you. Shanti... this food is too nice. Wow, this dinner is awesome. New recipe? I didn't make it, compliments to the chef. Hi aunty Shanti, I just whipped it up in five minutes. Yeah, but you know they say... If a lady can't cook, then there's no hope for her. - [laughs] - True that Shanti... it's what makes or breaks a marriage I always say. Give me that earphones. Why are you being so rude? [smack] What happened to him? He can talk. You know how kids are these days. So, what are you studying? She's going to be a doctor. Just like you, same campus. Tell him. Tell him. Tell him. I'm first year. Okay. Actually I've seen you around. You're third year right? Yeah. Hey if you need any help you should take my number. Give her your number. Plus he comes up first for everything. He even won a scholarship to the University of Cape Town. No way he'll take it... he won't leave his mother. - Excuse me. - No wait, wait. Shanti, give him some more cheesecake. Yeah, what's wrong? Give me your plate and I'll give you some more. Ashew. Hold on, don't go yet. Why is the group here? They needed a place to practice and his mum is ill so I thought I'd help out. Jodi help him to take his stuff to the car. Come on, go help. Hey... I know what you up to. What do you mean? Why you telling everybody you made the cake when you bought the thing? [cellphone rings] Just imagine. I'm coming just now. Prizzy, your stories are too much hey. Jennifer... how do you expect me to send him out? - Just shut up and think of something. - You shut up. Jennifer? Jennifer? Lucky that doctor was wearing a mask. Full puss came out of my back. Like choice butter, that puss was. Guys, the tea is on its way. I just want to put this bin bag out the way. The fish guts is smelling. Ah okay. I'll be back just now. Ow... oh. Are you okay? - Yeah my hand just got cramped. - Let me do it. Shanti you should check for Arthritis. Ok so... So good seeing you... JoJo. Please don't call me that. Sorry I'm... so used to calling you that. Okay. JoJo! You heard about mama? Yeah, I'm so sorry. We just taking it one day at a time. - How long until she gets better? - I don't know... what I would do without her. [soft music] Sorry. Bye. Hey Jodi... [indistinct chatter] [soft music continues] [humming] [pegs falling] [sniff] You still smoke. Only when I'm stressed. So I see your... daughter didn't waste any time falling into the arms of the ex. Can't blame her. Asheel's quite a hunk. I'll give him maybe five or six out of ten. Hmm... really? Want to know what I give Prishen? One. [drum music] You know what I'll give Prishen? [cough] One. [drum music continues] [drum music stops] Hey... your mom put butter and cheese this time. Yeah you know my ma. [laughs] What was going on at home last night? Pray meeting. [mumbles] Hi Prishen. Hey howzit Divani, how are you? Last night was so much fun. Oh my God, your mum's such a great cook. And your mom really enjoyed the crab curry. I'm definitely coming over for cooking lessons. Ah you don't need cooking lessons. That dessert you made was tops. Ah so sweet. They came for dinner last night. Our moms are old friends. So you must be the girlfriend? Uhm... We're best friends. Oh ok. Let's do lunch some time. You bring the main course and I'll organize dessert. - Bye. - Bye. [makes girly voice] I'll bring the main course, you bring the dessert. - Byeee. - Jodes, come on man. And I love your mum. So fake! You don't even know her. Well you seem to know how very well. So when do I get to taste your cooking? [laughs] You know I can't cook. Can I actually have some of that? You and I make such a good team. Aw... thanks my darling. Ma, something smells amazing. - Hi Prishen. - Howzit Divani. Divani came to show me her famous lavender creme Brule. I mean... Yeah, same thing and then I'm showing how to make my fish biryani. - Ah thank God, I'm starving ma. - And we just finished our first one. And we need... an official taster. Wait, wait, wait. Hold it. You look so cute together, wait I'll take a picture. Uhm... oh man, this phone got no buttons. Why all these phones got no buttons? Aunty Shanti, just press here. No, I don't know how to use it man. Ok. never mind. I'll take a selfie. [drum beat music] So cute you all look. [click] [click] Hmm... [click] [click] It's great that Divani and Prishen are spending more time together. [Shanti] And the way he's enjoying Divani's desserts. He hasn't even spoken about Jodi. Does he speak about Jodi? Because she eats his lunch. Shanti I need help here. I'm on the phone... with a customer. What you say? She eats his lunch? Yeah, someone's got to feed her. I'm mean she's looking so thin. Shanti, must I grow four hands or what or are you coming to help me here? I'm coming man! I got to go, I'll see you later. No, no, no! I'm not coming to that park again. You find another place and you send me the address. Shanti! Smoke! Bring the fire extinguisher! [fast drumroll] - [coughing] - Oh Shit! - Shanti! - I'm coming man. [loud pressure spray] Bloody hell. [navigation voice] In 200 meters turn left. [navigation voice] Destination on your right. [violin music] Oh shit. [chickens clucking] [drum music] [Jennifer] This place stinks. What you getting excited for? You said I must find a place where nobody can see us? Yeah, but everyone can see me here. Yeah but it's so busy and everybody is doing their own thing. Plus, who would expect to see you here? [laughs] Good reason too. Why you brought me here Shanti? Divani's coming over again and I needed a few special ingredients so I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone. You know if my plan wasn't working so well, I would leave here right now. Right now. [buzzing markets] Uncle... how much are the chilies? Ten Rand ma, special price for you. But last week it was R8. What happened? Taste and buy. Hot, hot, hot! I can't believe I'm actually standing here bargaining for chili's of all things. [crunch] Uhm... this you call... you call chilies? [struggles to swallow] This thing tastes like cardboard. [coughs] - Come on Let's go. - Just go. Never mind, take it for R6. [weepy voice] And I want my change. [groans] [breathes heavily] Thank you ma. - [Jennifer] Let's just go. - [Shanti breathes heavily] [heaves and huffs] Here. [buzzing markets] Keep the change. Shanti! [drum beat and Indian music] Oh shit! [music continues] What's wrong with her? Ah no. My friend's just checking one outfit out. You got any nice special today? Not this week but next we got a lovely... What's the specials? Oh Aya... [mumbles] Oh, I see you bought the whole market. Hey, get out man. I'm making pickles. Aya, my friend is in the change room and she might take long. But I can see you still got shopping to do, so why don't you carry on? No honey... I'll keep you company. No, Aya. She might be long. You, you carry on. Oh there's your friend. Aya uhm... This is my friend... Aisha Bibi. We old school friends. As-Salaam-Alaikum. Why what happened? She can't talk what? No, uhm... Oh, she had her wisdoms removed. Oh shame. If you were friends together at school... then you must be knowing my daughter-in-law, Jennifer? I keep telling Shanti she would have been the perfect daughter not for me. Oh Aya. Jennifer's not that bad. She may be cooked in the head... but has she ever let you down? That's true hey. I must talk less. But you know she smokes. And her dressing... What chop shops things she wear. She should dress like your friend. I saw Madumbi’s there. Why you don't buy some for Jennifer? I know she liked it from school days. Hey, why you talking like that? Since when do you like her? No, I don't like her but I'm just saying you know, I know you got a good heart and I know you got place in that heart for Jennifer. Hey... she must make space for me. You know I had to come here by taxi. Where is she going to bring me and come here? But just now I can go anywhere where I want to. You know why? Elvis is going to buy Jodi a new car. [guitar strum] Jen... Jennifer. Listen. Look. I told you... I'm in charge of the car department. Okay. I just haven't found the right one that's all. [golf swing] What? A Beamer? Are you mad or what? [laughs] No uhm... ah Dylan. No, no. You're not laughing. [bursts out laughing] No he's... crying. [laughs more] He's probably thinking about how his wife used to nag him and stuff. Okay look... I really have to go. I love you too. Okay... bye. - Shut it. Shut your mouth. - Oh I love you too, I love you too Jennifer. - Shut it. Idiot. - I love you baby, oh I love you so much baby. -[laughs] Ah shut up, get out! - I can't wait to see you, that's why I'm calling you ten times. I love you! I love you! You going to get me in trouble bro. I mean really. I'm more of a classic guys like a Golf GTi. - Yeah you're a Golf man... - Yeah. - Lower the suspension, - [laughs] And after the springs you're going to supe the whole cab. - Gold bumpers like your teeth. - [laughs] Yeah! Yeah and then you can get the speakers and subwoofers from... what's your friend name? -Tiny! -Tiny! [laughs] Pump up the bass. I used to like that. [laughs] But only when I'm ready. Yeah... only when you're ready. My own car! [high pitch scream] Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you Dad. Congratulations. [excited laughing] Ah thank you! Oh my God!

Yeah I need to change those. #Your mother's Psycho. #I know. [laughter] Ugh... - Ah congrats babe. - Aw thank you. [giggling] I can't believe your dad bought you a BMW. Actually my mum chose. - Ah, that makes more sense. - [laughs] Oh! I can't wait to hear this one. - It's for the condom dispenser. - [laughs] Really? - Student Council Duty. - Is that what they call it now a days? You know, I fill the girls toilets. - Oh right! - [laughs] And here I thought it was my lucky day. Shame. You have a long wait ahead of you. Yeah I know. Anyway Let's take this baby for a ride. I'm driving. Come on Elvis, get that grumpy look off your face. Buying the car was my department. I was going to choose it. But she loved this one babe. What's the rush? Child needed a car. For what? It just doesn't make sense. Did you see how excited she was today? [sighs] You went over my head and played your own cards. Ah calm down Elvis, when I've done you a favor. You've been hunting for a car for over a year now love. You just don't get it do you? [sighs] And where are you going to park the damn thing? [soft Indian music] [social media message] [soft music continues] [soft music continues] [indistinct chattering] And he drinks too much. [indistinct chatter] He came down the stairs and rolled all the way to the bottom of the staircase. Instead of helping him, we were laughing. We couldn't help it. That bloody fellow deserves it. He spends all his wages on drinking. [birds chirping] Hey, you too cool to drive in my car today? [whispers] Shit. I just have to drop off some stuff for Asheel's mum. Oh... Asheel's mum. Come on Prishen, you know his mum is sick. Look... let's just meet for lunch. Normal spot? I can't. I'm helping Divani with some studies. You've got to be kidding me. Jodi, my mom offered. What was I supposed to say? No... I get it. Main course and dessert. Come on, you're being ridiculous... look. Let me just come with you. I'm taking Asheel to the mechanic. [sighs] Wow! What are you trying to say here? I don't know... Did he choose [mumbles] as well? Huh JoJo? [soft sad music] [metal thump] This place is too lovely. Yeah, it is isn't it? Elvis is a member here. Of course I introduced him to golf, now he's addicted. Preggie plays golf too. Preggie plays golf? Yeah, he plays with one of his friends. - Are you ladies okay? - We are good thanks.

What the hell are you talking about? Asheel, This song is forever. Oh, come on! How did you get this? You know where I got that. Are you really making this about me, huh? Where's the teddy bear I gave you? And what about your Divani, huh? You and her were probably examining each other while she fed you cupcakes. Yeah, so what if we were? Well at least Asheel didn't pretend to love me. - Then go back to him! - I will! [smack] [soft background music] [sad Indian music] [calling Prishen] If you don't go to the bathroom now I'm going to sort you out. Prishen. Wake up Prishen, you are going to be late. [indistinct] I am going to warn you. [sad Indian music continues] [Shanti] Are you listening to me? My child is not eating and he's not talking to anyone. It's normal behavior after a breakup. Are we bad mothers? We're not bad mothers. I'm also feeling lousy Shanti. They are children. But we have to step in. You can see how wrong they are for each other? Preggie is worried and concerned he's going to find out. How is he going to find out? No one is going to find out and they can't. Maybe we should just tell them before they all find out. No, no Shanti, listen to me... we almost at the finish line you can't cave in now. Are you listening to me? Look at me! Shanti, look at me! No one can know about this. I am warning you. So just zip it. Hey babes what happened? No chows? Just one day... Just one day I don't cook and you having a heart attack. No, no I'm just asking. Every day I cook. Every day I do everything. I wash the clothes. I clean this house. I don't just do everything for you. I do everything for this entire neighborhood. What more you expect from me? Twenty to the dozen, she's smoking. Like a chimney. The way she's carrying on we'll all get cancer. I won't have a chance to get to 80. She's making sure of that. Outside only. Yeah... backyard. One way! What's your problem? Saris, I'll call you back. You talking to me? I spoke to Asheel today on campus. She told him I want to get back together with him. And that it was pining for him. Jen... is this true? You should be ashamed of yourself. Did you hear how she speaks to me? Did you hear that? I did this for your own good. For me? For me? - What a load of shit! - Hey! -Watch your mouth. Don't you dare speak -to me in that tone. I will not tolerate such disrespect in my house. Take you stupid car back. [keys fall] And FYI... Asheel and I broke up because he cheated on me. Many times. Hey, what you been up to? What you been up to? Look in my eyes and speak the truth. [sighs] [knocking gently] Jodi? Jodes? Are you ok? [soft crying] [sobbing] Hey Prish... I swear if Pirates don't beat Chiefs today I am going to shave my head bald. [laughs] What happened? Someone died, huh? [laughs] Dad, do you remember that Scholarships to the University of Cape Town? Yeah! I'm rethinking it. Why, what happened? I think it's what's best for me right now. It's just... before it was my dream to be a doctor. It was your dream for me to be a doctor. Making you guys happy and proud is what I've always try to do. Look Prishen, I'm just asking because I'm concerned, you know. You were happy. I am happy. We've got friends and family there and... I won't be alone at... Well I mean... Cape Town is not far but... it's not exactly near. I really want to go dad. Hmm, okay. Please support me on this one. Okay. Thanks dad. What happened? He was happy, he was so sure. [sniffs then cries] My sons going to leave me. Actually going to leave me. I mean what happened? [sobs] It's all my fault. Why? Why is it your fault? I could just strangle Jennifer right now. It's bloody sickening bro? Can you believe it... ey? They bought that ridiculous car so that they couldn't travel together. And they're mothers, these are their kids. Do you know what's so swak bro? My own daughter couldn't come talk to me about Prishen. Yeah I think she was skrik. Just like the two of us. What do you mean the two of us? You know when Shanti and I got married... we promised each other when it came to family and children... we will never keep secrets from each other. Now look what she's done. We can't let them get away with this bro. Damn right! What you got in mind? Oh, I got something in mind bro. I got something in mind. [silence] [whispers] You start. No you start. You were the one who took Preggie in the first place. - Ok I'll start. - No I'll start. See Jodi... we found out about your relationship. The one you were keeping a secret from your parents. Just get to the point Jen! And then we met and decided that your relationship was wrong. You two decided? Well, we had to do something to stop the two of you from making more mistakes. It's our job as parents to guide you. Oh I love this version of it. Well, we had to do something Elvis, at the rate the two of them were going at it behind the wedding at the hall. What you was doing behind the hall? I was there and I realized... things were getting out of control between the two of them. And then we did you all a favor and we... found your new partners and then we broke you up... and now we here to tell you... now you all know. Do them a favor? This... Ma just be quiet for God's sake. We can't deal with your dramatics right now. Jen? Anyway... if there are no other questions. Nobody has anything else to say... I think we can all adjourn. Is that it? Huh? Is that it? You two have nothing more to say? Let's just go home. You know you are unreal. The both of you are unreal. Don't you raise your voice when you talking to me. Jen, just be quiet please. Let's just go home. Ma... Jodi come with me. Prishen? Ma just... leave us alone. [door slams shut] You just stop putting your nose in the business. But we had no choice. What do you mean you had no choice? - We had to do something. - Well, you have caused chaos! You know what, I can't do this anymore. I'm just going to find my child. -Shanti! -Well we caused chaos. At least we did something which is more than I can say for the two of you. Yeah, we gave them support. We didn't cause all this nonsense. Support? You supporting her when she is so ungrateful with that boy. What do you mean that boy? Listen, you're just as bad as her Jennifer, just move. Prishen wait, Prishen! You can't go Prishen, wait! Shanti, just let them go please. What's your problem? I'm sorry Prishen. Shanti just leave him alone. What wrong with you? Prishen please. Please, I'm sorry. [car engine starts] Let them go. - I'm sorry. - Let them go. You! You Jennifer, it's all your fault. You're stupid plan backfired on us. No, I don't think I can take all the credit for it. You came to me first. That is so typical Shanti. I feel like I'm in high school again Hey look everyone! Betrayal is staring me in the face all over again. Can you two just stop? Oh my God you still on that? He didn't even like you. Okay Shanti, let's go home. He was my high cool crush. You were the only one I told about it. He asked me out. What was I supposed to say? You were supposed to say NO! How many times must I say I'm sorry? You were my best friend! I trusted you! Yeah, but you didn't give me a chance to explain. You don't deserve a chance. You treated me like trash. Because you are trash. Hey Jennifer, that's not fair. Guys, guys. Let's just stay out of this please. And you had to fall pregnant, didn't you? And get him to marry you? Wait Jenn are you talking about Pregs here? Rubbing it in my bloody face every single day. Hey bro... Why didn't you tell me about this? Hey guys, I know nothing about the story here. Let me tell you something else Shanti. That product of your pregnancy is a thorn in my bloody flesh. Don't talk about my child that way. I will talk about you child any damn well... No you won't! - Hey! - Yes I will because he's an offspring of a cow. What did you call my wife? Why are you shouting? Because she's attacking every member of my family. A cow? A cow? You are a pathetic excuse for a mother. That's not fair okay? You can't even cook! Well at least I saved my daughter from having a fat embarrassing mother-in-law like you. Jennifer you don't shut your mouth. What you going to do bro? - You control your wife. - What you going to do... Just control your wife. [all shouting] Aya! [thunder roars] [rain drizzles] [Jodi] I should have told you about Asheel. And that he was trying to get me back. Seeing you guys together... it made me really jealous. You know I would have never cheated on you. I should have never let Divani get in my head. Let's forget all of this and let's start over. [thunder roars] Our mother's will make our lives a nightmare. - So what's the point? - [sighs] Please... I love you Jodi. I love you too. But it's not that simple is it? I mean... it was so easy to break us up. Doesn't that say something? It says a hell of a lot about the two of them, but we can make this work. No we won't. They'll make sure it won't work. What you trying to say? We can still be friends. [sobbing] I don't want to be friends with you Jodi. Prishen I am sorry. Please... [sniffs] Please just take me home. [sad flute music] [sad flute music continues] [thunder roars] [sad flute music continues] [sad flute music continues] [music fades out] It was... it is just a high school infatuation babe. The fight wasn't even about him. She was my other half. We were inseparable and... she betrayed me. You spend so much of your energy fighting. What? First, it's my mother. Then Jodi. Then Shanti. Now me. When is enough, enough? When the fighting doesn't mean anything anymore. You just... spend so much time on it. You want me to just forget everything? What she did to me? I just want you to be happy. [car door closes and car starts] [tick] [tick] Hey, you blind or what? The hole is there. Pregs. Howzit Cuzzy? - Look I'm sorry what I said? - No, no! I should be the one apologizing. Sorry bro. How's that jaw of yours? Hey... you got one... helluva right hook, huh. [both laugh] [both sigh] [both] I'm sorry bro! You know... when dad... first took me to meet his parents. I was so excited. But I realized so quickly that... I was never going to be good enough... for their family. I tried. I tried so hard... but they didn't make it any easier for me. But your dad and I... your dad and I, we knew we were soulmates... we... we knew we belonged together. He had to fight so hard for me. Those were the toughest years for me. For us. [sobbing] I didn't realize I was doing the same thing to you. I thought I was so right about everything. But I was completely wrong. [sad music] [sad music continues] [sad music continues] [music fades] [knocks on door] [sad music loudens] - I'm so sorry. - I'm so sorry too. We should have never stopped them. [music continues] Arsevan! I said crimson red not blood red. I don't know where this man learned his basic colors. He's such an ass, this one ey. Arsevan. I gave you the CD. Are you in charge of the music right? So you play the CD when I cue you. You got one shot to get it right ok? You understand? Bet he can't even speak. Hey Jodi!
