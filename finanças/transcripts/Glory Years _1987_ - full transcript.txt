Uhhh... Donna Palmer. She and I were in the same English class for four years. I watched those breasts grow up. John: And even Jack never scored with her. Gerald: Yeah, the only blemish on an otherwise remarkable record. [laughing] You're not gonna believe this. Jack! Jack! Jack! Hey hey hey! Jack, what's this? I... I've fallen victim to a genetic abnormality. I can distinguish light patterns, but not at night. Oh my God, what a tragedy. You mean what bullshit. John! John, is that you? No, it's Stevie Wonder. John, that's not funny, he can't see. Come on, Gerald, you're not actually buying this bologna. This is Jack! The guy who showed up for his draft physical wearing a strapless evening gown. I'm afraid God has punished me for stunts like that, I've lost the precious gift of sight. Bullshit. Can somebody walk me to the booze? How did you know that there was a bar here if you can't see, huh, Jack? Gerald: Enough already, John, it's right this way. Excuse me! Will you stop that?! Scotch please. It's a shame you can't see a certain female on the dance floor. Donna Palmer, the one that got away. Remember? Donna Palmer? Her husband's a lucky man. No no, Mr. Stein says she's divorced. Oh really? A hundred bucks says I nail her tonight. Bet! Jack, you don't have to prove anything to us. A bet is a bet! Point me towards her, boys. Excuse me, I'm blind! Here, it's this way. All he's gonna get is a walk. Donna: Poor Jack, tell me about your blindness. It's a hereditary disorder I wouldn't wanna pass on, so I had a vasectomy. Not that I get to be with too many women anymore. Oh Jack, Jack you are so courageous. And you're very thoughtful. The guys tell me you're more beautiful than ever, could... Could I possibly touch your face? See, he's caressing her face. She let him touch her face because she thinks he's blind! That's as far as it goes! [stammering] The master of disaster is back! Yes! Yeah! Drummond: Yeah, Jack Sanders. There's never a dull moment when Jack's around. He's the master of disaster. [coughs] Jesus, we shouldn't be smoking this stuff, I read it causes genetic damage in rats. You want your kids to be born with two tails? First I need a wife, then I'll worry about how many tails my kid has. [clapping] Like fine wine, they've gotten better with age. [clapping] You haven't, Mr. Stein! Whoever said that, I wanna see your mother first thing Monday morning! [laughing] Just jesting. In 1966, Senior Class Treasurer Gerald Arkin proposed that we initiate a college scholarship fund for disadvantaged students. Woman: That's all of us! Inside of that drum is money. $25,000! [clapping] I tell you, Jack could have taken him. Yeah, when was the last time you, me, and Jack were together? Your mother's funeral? Jack wasn't at the funeral. It was my mother's last request. I know, it was the day after your suicide attempt! I don't remember. Yeah, well you were heavily sedated. Yeah, that was the day he tried to hit me up for a loan. He said he blew a bundle investing in stone wash jeans. I hated to say no, but every penny I make goes into my video store. Maybe I should have taken my mother to another specialist. No more dope for you, you're getting guilt-ridden and paranoid. Why couldn't I had just had my mother come live with us after my father died? Because she was a pain in the ass just like you are. Yeah. [clapping] Because of you, the class of 1966... We came back too early, Stein the human sleeping pill's talking. Stein: On Monday, Gerald Arkin will redeposit that money, and shortly thereafter, we will begin selecting the lucky recipients of your generosity. The class of 1966! [clapping] At this time, I feel compelled to ask the driving force behind this endeavour, Gerald Arkin, to come up here and say a few words. Gerald? [clapping] [whistling] I can't go up there. I can't go up there, they'll know I'm stoned, John! Gerald? You've gotta go up there, help me out. Look, I have a good reputation with these people, please! All right, all right, all right, don't you flip out on me. Cool, okay. Where are you? Man: Who is that? Woman: I can't remember him... For those of you that don't recognize me, my name is John Moss. Gerald asked me to speak on his behalf because he's a little choked up at the moment. You know how emotional dentists can get. [laughing] But this alumni fund has meant so much to him. Only two weeks after Gerald attempted suicide... [crowd murmuring] He was back soliciting money for the alumni fund. Now that's the kind of man that my friend Gerald Arkin is! [clapping] [cheering] I was in the bathroom because I had a stomach ache! I wasn't smoking any marijuana! I haven't smoked any marijuana since the sixties! Right, John?! Why are you all looking at me?! Gerald? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine, Mr. Stein. I was, like John said, I was pulling everybody's leg. You had me worried. Oh, I'm sorry. Where's your lovely wife tonight, Gerald? Lois? Oh, she's off on a three day weekend. To be perfectly honest, Mr. Stein, after my attempted suicide, Lois and I joined the suicide prevention couples group. And well, I got bored with it. She loves it. They're in Niagara Falls. And John's better half? He's still looking for his better half. Would you like to dance? Uh, uh... Gerald: Go to it, John. It's been nice dancing with you, Renee. Well, good try. Maybe next reunion. Excuse me. Hey John, what happened with Renee? Ah, I can't dance that fast crap. Gerald: Come on, you move well. You're a liar. Gerald: I'm only trying. Uh oh. John: Well? Gerald: Oh no no no, I got the picture. Beautiful, voluptuous red head, and the blind man falling to the grass in an impassioned embrace. I nailed her in the Chem Lab next to the inert gases. You're such a romantic. Hey, I do my best, pal, see? Confidentially, boys, I spent a lot of time alone in my room thinking about Donna Palmer, you know what I mean? Probably why you went blind. [laughing] Blind, Gerald, listen, how's my little Goddaughter Jacqueline doing, huh? She's great. She got my eyes. Unfortunately, she has her mother's nose. Hey, you know, I tell everybody how you named her after me. Thanks. Hey, you okay with this suicide business? What, are you kidding? I spend too much time thinking about my impotency to worry about suicide. John, how's your love life going, huh? Ah, that'll be all right as soon as I learn how to dance fast. How about yourself? Not bad, I'm going out with this great girl, Melinda Murphy, her family's real big in the Garment Center, got a nice house on Long Island. Geez, you oughta see this thing. Sounds like a good deal for you. Not bad, not bad, except her father hates my guts. Frankly, my lifestyle is not conducive to a stable relationship, just ask my ex-wives. John: You're still in touch with your ex-wives? Jack: Yeah, I send them a few bad checks every now and then. Bad checks? Why would you do that? Jack, who is that? Jack! Hey, you're in some kind of trouble, aren't you, Jack? Get in here and close the door now! John: Jack, who was that guy out there? Jack: His name is Drummond, he's a strong armed boy who works for a loan shark that I'm in deep with. John: Uh huh. Gerald: Uh huh. Jack: I need to borrow some money, my friends. John: Uh huh. Gerald: Uh huh. Jack: $25,000. Some friends! If you were in that much trouble, it was stupid of you to show up at your own reunion! Well I had to come, I didn't think that gorilla would think the blind man was me! Gerald, you're gonna have to lend me the alumni fund. Are you nuts?! Shhh, keep your voice down! I got inside information on a fight in Las Vegas tomorrow. Tomorrow is the Middleweight Championship of the World! That's the main event, I'm talking about the prelim. Two welterweights, Manny Larriaga against Frank Bukowski. Manny's a two to one favorite, he's gonna take a dive in round six. Look, Jack, as your friend I would like to say yes, but as Senior Class Treasurer, I have to say no. Gerald! You're forgetting how you became the Senior Class Treasurer. I rigged that election, remember? Look, that money is not mine to give you! I only need it to make the bet, after the fight you'll have $75,000, you'll have the alumni money back ready for deposit, I take the second 25 Gs, pay this gunzo off, you keep the remaining 25! $25,000. I could put my mother in a mausoleum. And with the money that's left over I could get my daughter a nose job. Wait a minute, why does Gerald get 25 grand? Don't start. Look, I'm the one who's taking the risk, I'm lending it to him. Well I'm warning both of you, if you don't cut me in on this, the friendship is over, finished! You are such a baby! All right, if you're in we each gotta take a third responsibility for the alumni fund -if anything goes wrong, right? -Right. -Right? -Right! -Nothing will go wrong, will it? -Nah, come to Vegas with me, we'll drink, we'll gamble, we'll screw hookers, we'll do everything we did in High School. We screwed hookers in High School? I did! Come on, we'll pack 20 years of fun into two days. Come on, guys, what do you say? My heart is beating so fast! I say yes! I don't know if this is fear or excitement. I just know that I'm feeling something. This always happens when you're around, Jack. Well... Yes, I'll do it, I'll do it! It'll be just like old times! Oh God, that's what I'm afraid of. [laughing] Gerald: Jack, are you sure Manny Larriaga's going to lose it on purpose? Jack: It's a sure thing. Gerald: You sure? Gerald: Sure I'm sure! John: I can't believe the entire alumni fund fit in that little satchel. Jack: Hey, he's kidding, driver, there's no money in the satchel. It's his underwear. John: Beautiful entrance. That's okay, I can carry this one. It's my bag! He's very attached to that bag. "My bag!" Gentlemen, I give you The Dunes! John: Jack, let's test our luck. [quarters dispensing] [laughing] Now look, if we drop down the whole 25 Gs on the prelim fight, someone's gonna get suspicious, we gotta divide the bet up into three separate bets. John: How much time do we have before the fight? About an hour, but we're gonna need some time to get the tickets from the scalpers. Hi, my name is Norma, you gentlemen ready? I'm too nervous to eat. Look, I'm gonna go to the gift shop. Excuse me. [enchanting music] What's your soup du jour? Why John, is there one you won't eat? Clam chowder, it's quite good. [quarters drop] Aw, I'm such a klutz! I'll help you. What happened to your hand? Oh, I burned it in the kitchen. I'm kind of klutzy myself. I'm getting kind of hungry myself! I'll have a bowl of chowder, a caesar salad, a veil parmigiana, and an order of french fries. You got enough paper on there for that order? So what do you recommend, sweetheart? For you? The large mouth bass would be appropriate. [snickers] I'll have a chicken pot pie and a beer please. Smartass. Nice ass. Well Larry Holmes, the odds makers have made Manny Larriaga a two to one favorite in this fight against Frank Bukowski, frankly I have to agree. Right Al, Manny has a little bit too much experience, and I think he's gonna dominate the fight. Okay, here they come now. [trumpet instrumental music] Hey, Wilson, I knew you'd be here. Yeah, word is out on you, man. Jack: What do you hear? What I hear is there's a loan shark who's gonna bust you up real bad to make an example if you do not pay him. Man, you gotta get your ass outta here. Thanks for the warning, but I'm bailing out with this fight. Yeah right, okay, we'll hang later, man. Maybe. Jack, what are they gonna do to you if you don't pay up? They'll break every bone in my body, then they'll get angry. [bell dings] Ring Announcer: Good evening ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Total Sports Pavilion where tonight, later in the evening, Risobo Hotel and Country Club will proudly present a 15 round contest... Are you sure it'll be all right? Yeah, it's all right. The opening bout of the evening features ten rounds of boxing... Bukowski's gonna knock Manny out! Ring Announcer: Introducing, in the blue corner, here is Frank "The Terminator" Bukowski! [cheering] [booing] Hey, [mumble], a winner! And in the red corner, out fighting out of Scranton, Pennsylvania, introducing Manny "The Mongoose" Larriaga! [thunderous cheering] [mocking sounds] Referee: Let me have your attention, once again I wanna tell you to protect yourselves at all times. Watch your low blows and watch your holding and hitting, above all, when I tell you break, I want you to step back and break clean, you understand that, you understand? Shake hands and good luck to you both. [bell dings] This is round five and it's been nonstop since the opening bell. I'll tell you, this fight will not go the distance, not if it keeps up at this pace. [cheering] What's Larriaga doing? Jack, he almost knocked Bukowski out. Relax, he's just making it look good. [bell dings] Gerald: I don't know, Jack. Jack: This is it, this is our round, boys, round six. [whistles] God, I think I'm gonna faint. Wait for Larriaga. You can go down together. [bell ding] Come on. Well here we go, round six. All right, kicking in. What the... [slow motion] No! Nooooo! Nooooo! [booing] He can't go down! No, he can't go down! He can't go down! I got too much... Robert: It's him, it's him! It's the scum that spoiled your wedding, Melinda! But I couldn't have married Steven feeling the way I do about Jack! And he is not a scum! Why is he in that ring? Because he is scum, that's why! Oh... Could have been a union of two of the finest families in the Garment Center. And then that scum comes along. I love him, daddy. You can love Steven. You?! You... You, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you. Al: Security guards seem to have everything under control, we just have to find out what in the world is going on. Book me on a flight to Las Vegas. This is the craziest thing I've ever seen. Drummond. Drummond! Look at this. Look who it is! It's Jack Sanders. Go to Las Vegas, you bring me back my 25 grand! Or you bring back his spleen! I have never seen anything quite like this. As you saw, a man jumped into the ring just as Frank Bukowski was about to go down, and he kept Frank from hitting the canvas. Larry Holmes is up in the ring now, Larry, can you hear me? Referee David Curly, is this fight official? Yes, it's official, I knocked that motherfucker out! Hell, I haven't officially counted him out yet. Come on, man, he's out! How about it, Al? Al: They finally pulled the man away from Frank Bukowski. One, two, three... Al: And Davie Probe is counting Bukowski out now. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten! Al: Well that's it, it's official, Larriaga is the winner. [trumpet instrumental music] It's gone! $25,000! Easy! Take it easy. This is Las Vegas! Remember, you can win just as easily as you can lose. We'll get it back. Yeah, I swear on my seventh wife. The master of disaster! Gerald, I told you I'd get the money back for you. It's all yours. Come on, I'll buy you a drink. $25,300. Excuse me, sir. Yes? Aren't you the man who wouldn't let his mother live with him after your father died? Well yes, but... Then we can't cash these. Casino rules. Where are you going with my chips? Excuse me, where's he going with my... I couldn't let my mother live with me! She and Lois just didn't get along! My mother lives with me and my wife. Face it, Gerald, you hated your mother! No I didn't, I love my mother. I love my mother, I love my mother, I love... I love my mother, I love my mother! I love my mother, I love my mother! Maybe we should wake Oedipus up, huh? Nah, let him sleep. Between losing the money and the police interrogation, he's exhausted. Thank God they dropped the criminal charges. Well, they had to. What're they gonna do, charge him with breaking and entering a boxing ring in a lawful stoppage of a prize fight? I still don't see how you're gonna win the money back cheating at cards. Listen and learn, my friend, the key to winning at blackjack is knowing where the ten value cards are. Picture cards and tens, that is. If I can mark those cards, it gives me just enough of an advantage to beat the house. Well, how you gonna do that? The dealer and the pit boss are watching you like a hawk, and upstairs they're watching through the one way mirror in the ceiling! Huh. You see John, I got hair cream on. By touching my hair lightly, I put a small fingerprint of grease on the back of any ten value card I get in my hand. Next time that card comes up, boom. I spot the fingerprint. Yeah, but won't they know it? Only my hairdresser will know for sure. Oh! Oh sheesh, I dreamt that we won all the money back and they wouldn't pay off. What have I done? That money was to provide an education for disadvantaged students. Because of me, poor kids won't get to go to college. Poor kids shouldn't go to college, they should be out working! Best situation for me to do is to get the dealer alone with no other players that way I can mark the cards faster. I'm too nervous to eat. I'm going to the gift shop. Norma! Hi, Norma! Good morning, John. Hey Norma, you remember Jack. Yeah, unfortunately I do. Do you have a moment to sit? Well I really have... Sure, I have a minute before my shift. And I thought chivalry was dead. John: A cassette of The Shining! A very scary movie. The scarier the better. I love horror films. It's my favorite genre! Gee, John, I thought food was your favorite genre. I could give you all the inside scoop on all the good horror movies! I own a video store. Really? Do you know if the sequel to Nightmare on Elm Streetis as good as the original? No way! You know John, if you're still in town tonight maybe we could watch this together. I'd really like that, Norma. Yeah John, you could be in for a real night of horror with Norma here! I'm leaving now, Norma, you're up. Well, you know... I don't know why John is with you, but I bet there's a cure for it. You know, Jack, you could be a little nicer to Norma. Why? Because I really like her, Jack. Psh! Let's go before my hair dries up. Be gentle with me, sweetheart. It's my first time. I wasn't cheating! Ow, my arm! I'm gonna sue them for defamation. How dare they accuse me of cheating in front of all those people?! Jack, you can't blame the dude, you were cheating! Now what do we do? Now what are we gonna do?! Yeah. This! John: Minnie's Ranch? Jack, this is a whore house! Yeah, this is just the tonic we need. What we need is my $25,000 back! Now look, Gerald, we are on what is known in the gambling world as a schneid, translated into everyday language, that means our luck is up our asses, pal. And going to a whore house is gonna change our luck? Look, we go get our batteries recharged, we take a nice drive out to the ranch, we get laid, we come back fresh as a daisy! I don't think I wanna go. Johnny! Look at these women, they're primed and ready to do anything your heart desires. Sure, for money. No, for jelly beans! Look, all my life I've been paying women for their favors, and I don't wanna do it anymore! Wait a minute, how about when we all nailed Andrea Hollander underneath the boardwalk, you didn't have to pay for that! I never told you, but she stole my wallet. Okay look, they take credit cards here at Minnie's. I'll tell you what, it'll be my treat, you won't have to pay a penny. Look, John, maybe we should go. It might change our luck. What are you gonna do there? You're impotent. Go for the ride. Maybe they have a game room. It's settled. Listen, we go upstairs, I wash this crap out of my hair... John: Gerald, when exactly did your virility problem begin? Gerald: As soon as I saw my mother hooked up to the intravenous. John: Gerald, your mother's illness wasn't your fault. Gerald: I know, but I'm the one who picked the Korean doctor. Gerald, I feel it in my bones, you're gonna conquer your little problem at the ranch.
