Sir. See, he is running away. Hey, Devdas! Where are you going off too? You runaway rogue! Come here! If he goes once, he doesn't speak about coming back. Doesn't matter if you're the landlord's son. It is the landlord's orders that all will... ...be getting a holiday but not you. - Bholu! - Yes? - What kind of a monitor are you? - Yes. Listen to this carefully. If he runs away, you'll be punished. - Understood? Give him. Give him some math. - Yes. - Here. Solve these problems. - Go and sit there. [INDISTINCT SHOUTS] Devdas... - I cannot do these problems. - Let me see. If the cost of 40 kilogram of oil, is fourteen rupees nine annas and three pie... Then this! What happened? Where is Deva? Teacher! KIDS: Catch him! [SHOUTING] I bought cheaper limestone to make... ...the room and you're wasting all of it? What did I do? I was looking at the math. Deva pushed me and ran away! - He pushed you and ran away? They're all so strong... - Yes. ...even then they couldn't stop him? Hey! What are you laughing at? Where did Deva go? - Sir. We couldn't catch Deva. - Why? He started throwing stones at us. He hit me with stones too. Here! Blood! He shattered his head with the stone! Come on! We will go to the landlord's court together. We will show him the behaviour of his son. Devdas will not come to the school from today! Come on, Bholu. Hey. Are you taking this lime with you in your pockets? What did I do? Go and keep it there. Go. He has ruined everything. Don't wipe out from your face. We have to show it to the landlord. Come on. Come on. Manno sister! Will Devdas really not be allowed to come to school? God knows. This is such a wretched teacher. I myself don't feel like coming. Come on. Now, you please order me, sir, what should I do? It is a very big problem. My son? When the protector becomes tormenter... ...then who will be safe? Where has he gone? How do I know, sir? When the boys went to catch him, he did this to them. Where did he go? Come here. See. Look at his condition. - Birju... - Yes, father? Bring Deva from wherever he is. You don't worry priest. Law is equal for all. I'll not side with him because he is a landlord's son. Come on. Come on. Why, Paro? You're alone here? Where is Deva? - He has run away, Dharamdas. - What are you talking about? - How can he run away? - I don't know, Dharamdas. He pushed him fully on the limestone! Did you look at Bholu's face? He was all whitened! Will you just go on laughing Where is Deva? How do I know? You know it. You know everything. Tell me, where is he? He must be hungry. Yes. He is hungry. But I won't tell you. He will hit me. I'll give him food myself. Yes. You only go but listen. Talk to him nicely and get him home by evening. Okay. I'll bring him home too, okay? [CHUCKLES] Do you know what happened in the school today, father? Have you gone mad? What happened in the school? I'm hungry. I'll eat something and then tell you. Okay. Mother, I'm hungry. Give me something to eat. Yes. This much only? How will I be content with this much? You used to be content with this much every day. - What is so special today? - Give it to her, daughter-in-law. It's not some special sweet. It's just plain roasted rice. Give it to my queen. Give it. Is it that enough? Who is it? Paro, come. Sit down. You're having tobacco once again, isn't it? So what? All men have it. You've brought something to eat? Give it to me. Listen, Paro. What did the priest do? He went and told the whole matter to uncle. He said everything to father? Then what happened? - He won't let you go to school. - Let him not. As it is, I don't want to study, give me the sweets. Sweets? I didn't bring any sweets. Okay, so go and bring me some water. Where will I get water from? If I won't get water, won't get sweets... ...then what will I get? Your head? - Go and get some water. - I won't go. I know, you will run away from here. - I'm telling you, I won't run away. Go. - I won't go. You won't go? Go, I'm telling you. I'll go and tell everything to uncle... [CRYING] Paro, go, get lost. [CRYING] Father, I searched everywhere but I didn't find Deva anywhere. Where must he have gone? Why are you crying, child? Deva hit me. Where is that rogue? He is there in the garden. Do you know uncle? He hides... ...there and smokes tobacco there. He has also started smoking! This is wrong! It is obscurity! This boy won't go to school and he won't be fed from today. - Bhijudas. - Yes? Go right away. And get him by his ear. May the blot of this family be ruined! [CUCKOO COOING] BHIJUDAS: Catch him! - What did you do, younger brother? - Catch him! He shouldn't be able to run away! Catch him! [GROANS] You run away from the school? [GROANS] DEVDAS'S FATHER: You fight? You act so insolently! That's enough! Please don't hit him! That's enough. One scolds with words and such. One doesn't just keep beating. Get aside, all this is due to your love. Dare anyone open the door! He won't get anything to eat or drink. Come on, son. Come and eat the food. No. I won't eat it. Come on, my dear son. Come on. PARO'S MOTHER: Paro. The food is getting cold. Mother, I won't eat food today. I've got a stomach ache. Come. Come here, Paro. Why did you tell them about me smoking? - Why did you hit me? - Why didn't you bring water? Why did you scold me? You're a fool. Okay. Never tell it again. - And you don't beat me, ever. - I won't beat you. So, have you forgiven me? Yes. I've forgiven you. Do you want an account now? Listen, Paro. Let us go to Mr. Ram's gardens. There is a bird's progeny. - I'll catch it and give it to you. - Let's go. Paro, keep these 3 rupees. "Oh unique bird, your house is somewhere far away." "The branch that you leave, there's no coming back again." "Oh unique bird, your house is somewhere far away." "The branch that you leave, there's no coming back again." "The blue sky is your swing..." "Not swing, it's the garden." "The blue sky is your garden, grain is your swing." "Grain is your swing." "With the white feathers, you swings happily." "You swing happily." "You've an enticing gait, a good gaze and golden beauty." "Oh unique bird, your house is somewhere far away." "The branch that you leave, there's no coming back again." "Listen to what we have to say, coming down from this branch." "Come down!" "Our house is nearby, come and eat the grains." "Come down!" "You've to sing and laugh as a guest today." "No, no. You've to laugh and sing." "Oh unique bird, your house is somewhere far away." "The branch that you leave, there's no coming back again." "If you've to go, come. We will decorate you with flowers." "Come bird come." "We will put the mark on your forehead." "And we will put anklets on your ankle." "Come bird come." "Then go happily, wherever you want to." "Oh unique bird, your house is somewhere far away." "The branch that you leave, there's no coming back again." "Oh unique bird, your house is somewhere far away." "Oh unique bird, your house is somewhere far away." "Oh unique bird, your house..." Father, that Madho has come with a complaint. The fishing net that he set in the river... ...Devdas has broken it and ruined it. Deva's mischief is going out of hand now. I'm thinking of sending him to Calcutta to your brother Nagendra. If he stays here, he will be spoiled! But the city at such a young age? No mother. Please don't create obstacles in this matter. All this is for his good. Okay, do whatever you think is correct. I won't interfere in anything. - No, son. Please don't cry. - No, mother. I'll not go to Calcutta. We aren't happy sending you too, son. But we are sending you to get a good education. Come on. Come on, my child. Come on. Come. Go, son. Sit in the car. Go. Please don't cry while going, I'm also with you. No. I won't go to Calcutta. You'll have to go? Come on! Sit. Sit. Driver, drive the car. - [GALLOP] - Oh God! Oh God! Please guard him! - Devdas! - Paro, as soon as holidays starts, I'll come back. Hey, listen... Vaishnavi, do you know how to sing? - Who says that I don't know? - Then why don't you sing? Songs aren't sung just like that. One has to give alms too. Come, let us go to your house. We will sing there. No, not there, sing here. You will have to give us paise. - I don't have paise. I have rupees. - Rupees? [CROW CAWS] Come on. We will sit there. Come on. "Come and meet. Come and meet, beloved." "Come and meet. Come and meet, beloved." "Radha was all alone and lost in the garden." "Radha was all alone and lost. O Krishna meet me." "Come and meet." "Come and meet, beloved." "Come and meet." "I don't feel like going to the gardens without you." "I don't feel like..." "These eyes eagerly wait for you every day." "These unfortunate eyes." "If this is the state of my mind, what will happen after that?" "Radha was all alone and lost in the garden." "Radha was all alone and lost. O Krishna, meet me." "Come and meet." "Come and meet. Come and meet, beloved." "Come and meet." "Has nobody sent you a message till now?" "Has nobody sent you a message till now?" "Has nobody sent you a message?" "A girl is crying and losing her sanity." "A girl is crying and losing her sanity." "Come and give her courage." "Come and show her your face, to her eyes!" "Radha was all alone and lost in the garden." "Radha was all alone and lost. O Krishna, meet me." "Come and meet. Come and meet, beloved." Mother, once again, I'll start going to school from tomorrow. I don't like it all alone. Okay. Go. Listen. Do one thing for me. Take this pot. And fill it with water from the lake. Okay. Hey, Paro, do you know that Devdas has come from Calcutta? - Who told you, sister Manu? - The air told me. I saw him coming myself in the car. A stick in hand, a watch on the wrist. Buttons, chain. He has become a proper gentleman. [BIRDS CHIRPING] He used to come to the village on every holiday. Then he used to go to Mussoorie... ...and Nainital with his friends for a couple of years. God knows why he has come to the village now. - Maybe, he started missing you. - Get lost! - What are you looking at, Paro? - Nothing. Grandma, please make my plait quickly. Are you crazy? Daughter-in-law. I've heard that Devdas has come from the city. He used to come to meet us every time... ...when he came back. But he hasn't come till now. The city is something like that. The city changes... ...the lifestyle of a person, it changes him. Even he must have changed. DEVDASS: Aunty... - This is Devdas's voice, isn't it? - Yes. Devdas! Your face has changed. Come in. Come inside. PARO'S MOTHER: Bless you, son. You've a long life. We were just talking about you. Your face has changed, son. [CHUCKLES] DEVDASS: You're seeing me after many days. Therefore. - Where is Paro? - PARO'S MOTHER: Paro? She was here a while ago. She must have gone upstairs. Paro, see, Devdas has come! DEVDASS: Let it be. I'll go up and meet her. [FOOT STEPS] [FOOT STEPS] Paro... What are you doing? You've grown up. Okay... It's night. I'll go now. Hey, what is this? You just came and now you're going? I've come from a journey, aunty, so I'm tired. - I'll come tomorrow. - Okay son. - Has Devdas gone? - Yes, daughter-in-law. There is so much love between Devdas and Paro. Why shouldn't it be? Both of them have grown up together. And Paro has reached the marriageable age. Both of them will look so nice as a couple. Why don't we speak to Mr. Narayan about their marriage? What are you talking, mother? You're just over thinking. They are such rich people with wealth... If they are rich and wealthy... ...then even beauty isn't something to be overseen. Everyone's astonished at our Paro. I'll surely go to Devdas's mother. I'll see how she will refuse me. Daughter-in-law, please see. I think I left the grain house open. [SLURPING] I was saying... Parvati's mother talked to me about her marriage. Yes. She has grown up. She has to be married. Therefore, she spoke to us. She said if with Devdas... - And what did you say? - I said no. You've done the right thing. First of all, they are of a lower Brahmin caste . And apart from it the relationship will be in the neighbourhood. You don't listen to what they say at all. Paro... Paro... Hey, you're really blind. Mother, who told you to go to Devdas's... ...mother to speak about Paro's marriage? Why didn't you ask me? They are landlords! Higher caste Brahmins. If we are lower caste Brahmins... ...we won't go to them for begging. We need not beg for our daughter's marriage. In fact, the people will come to our door. - Why are you worried? - I do get worried, son. You're saying the same thing again! You think that nobody asks about us. Forget one. I've got six proposals. If I don't marry my daughter in the... ...house of a bigger landlord than Mr. Narayan, then don't call me Neelkunth. I'll fix everything within a week. He stays in the village. Nowhere far away. I'll go right away! Paro, where are you going? I'm going to get water. The chilies are drying out there in the sun. Give them to me. Why, Paro? Why have you stopped here? Just like that. Okay, Paro, what is the age of the groom? - Whose groom? - Your groom's, who else's? Something like 23 or 24. What do you mean? I've heard that he is forty years old. God knows how many people are forty years old. Do I keep an account of everyone? I just know that my groom's age is twenty three or four. And what is his name? You know everything about what I eat and drink. And you don't know this? How am I supposed to know how your heart feels? Listen to it. Closer. Come closer... Devdas... Shut up, insolent one! There isn't any need of jokes. - Tell me what his name is? - I've told you. But I've heard that your marriage... ...is fixed with a overseer from Manikpur from grandmother. How has it been fixed? He will be married to me. He won't be married to grandma. It seems that something has been cooked internally. Something has been arranged secretly. There is nothing that has been arranged till now. I don't understand what you're saying, Paro. Then, I'll ask Devdas and tell you. What will you ask him? Whether you will marry me or not? Then, what? Think about it. Will you ask this of him yourself? Won't you feel embarrassed? What is to feel embarrassed in this? Was I embarrassed in telling it to you? I'm a woman. And I'm your friend. And then, he is a man. You're a friend and a woman as well. But, why is he a stranger? What I can tell you, can't I tell him? Sister, you apply vermillion on your forehead uselessly. You don't know what the meaning of the word husband is. He is my husband. He owns my embarrassment. Then how will I be embarrassed from him? Hey, Manorama! Someone has come to call you from your home. Okay, Paro. I'll come later. [SANSKRIT CHANTS] Who is it? It is me. [SANSKRIT CHANTS] [SANSKRIT CHANTS] [SANSKRIT CHANTS] Hey... Paro, you? So late in the night, have you come alone? PARO: Yes. What are you saying? Weren't you scared on the road? I'm not scared of ghosts. If not ghosts, you must be scared of men. Maybe at this time, not even from them. How did you enter the house? Did someone see? The security saw. There were servants in the balcony. Even they must have seen you. Maybe, they must have seen. Why did you do this, Paro? Won't you be embarrassed tomorrow? I would be. If I didn't know that you'd take care of my embarrassment. Me? But how will I show my face too? You, what is it about you? You're a man. Today or tomorrow or day after tomorrow... ...the people will forget what you did yesterday. Nobody will remember... ...at which night, the humble Parvati, had come to place her head at your feet... ...thinking she was useless and unworthy. I was thinking about your infamy, Paro. My infamy? I don't have any infamy. If I'll be nagged that I came to you secretly... ...then this nagging will not be set on me. You're crying, Paro? There is so much water in the river. Will my infamy not be washed with this water too? You shouldn't say like this. I can do everything for you. But... You know that my parents don't accept this. If I marry you without their permission... ...then where will you stay? I'll live at your feet. Give me some space here, my God! Paro... Come on. I'll drop you home. What is to be thought in that? Sure. If you can go then why can't I come with you? It will be infamous. Then it's better. Maybe there will be some solution for us from that. Come on, then. Nor your father and neither your brother will accept... ...a marriage proposal from a lower caste. Why do you instigate the honeycomb for such a small matter? It is a small matter for you. I ask you. How dare you ask such a question? You didn't have any thought about the respect of the house and of the family? Silent, shut up. If you say even one word about this I'll never see your face ever again. Go away from my sight! Deva, where are you going? - I'm going to Calcutta... - Calcutta? Listen to me. Devdas! Devdas... DEVDAS'S MOTHER: Devdas... Devdas! Devdas! Ganga, look! Devdas is going away angrily! Go and catch him and bring him back. Devdas, come back! Your mother is calling you! Devdas! [SLEIGH BELL] GANGA: Devdas... Listen to me! - [INDISTINCT] - [SLEIGH BELL] Devdas... Paro, I heard that Devdas has gone to Calcutta? Yes. Then, what has he decided about you? He must have decided something. I know him, Manu. I've total faith in him. "How can we believe in someone else?" "When you cannot believe in your heart itself." "It was in the middle of the road..." [INDISTINCT] [INDISTINCT] [SINGING] You are sleeping in the middle of the road. [SNORTING] [CLOCK BELL] Oh! Devdas! When did you come? You're a mirage! You are seen for one minute... ...and in the next minute, you disappear. Why haven't you slept yet? It is so late in the night. Sleep doesn't come every day, Chunni. You don't get sleep? I thought that good boys like you... ...never used to see the face of this moon light. But I've found it out today. [CLOCK BELL] What is the matter, Dev? You don't speak? Do you've some problem? It's seems, there's a pain in your mind. - Isn't there a pain in your mind? - No, not at all. Did you not see any sorrow throughout life? I've seen sorrow. But all this is about life. Either you live it with a smile or with tears. And one has to fool one's self to stay happy too. But... But why are you asking this? I've a habit to listen. You've a habit of listening? Then I'll make you listen one day... ...and you keep on listening. Chunni... Where were you all through the night? You act so innocently. Don't you know it? I know it. But I don't know it properly. To know it properly, you will have to become a happy go lucky man like me. I've heard that going there, one forgets all sadness? Right. That is right. Then take me there too. You? You will come with me too? Okay. We will go tomorrow. You sleep now. Sleep. DEVDAS: 'Parvati...' 'Ever since I've come here, I think about you.' 'But, none of our parents wish us to marry.' 'I cannot find any solution.' 'If I try to keep you happy...' '...my parent's emotions are hurt.' 'I cannot think about it.' 'You came to me risking everything that night.' 'Thinking about that, I feel so sad.' 'But, I wish to tell you something, Paro.' 'My mind never told me that I love you.' [CLOCK ALARMING] 'I'm sorry about the troubles you'll be taking for me.' 'Please try and forget me.' 'I pray to God that you succeed in this.' - Madho... - Yes? - Post this letter. - Fine, sir. What did you do, Devdas? Why? What did I do? You didn't do anything? She is your childhood friend. She left her respect and dignity... ...and came to you to ask for place at your feet. And you didn't tell her anything and came here? I was helpless. My parents didn't wish it. Yes but how did you tell such a big lie? How did you write that you don't love her? There was no other way than that. But you know how proud and adamant Paro is. Have you thought what will happen to her when and if she gets your letter? PARO: 'How much water is there in the river?' Will that not wash my defame too? Madho! Madho! Madho! MADHO: Yes. I'm here. Where's the letter that I gave you? I've just posted that letter in the post office. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Devdas, don't you want to go? I'm arranging to go. Will you take your household with you? On whom should I leave my house responsibilities? Even I've my entire luggage here... ...whom do I give that responsibility to? Chunni, I'll not return here now. The one whom we so respect he couldn't do this much for me? He couldn't pack my bed and couldn't pay my rent? Come with me like this right now. If you cannot understand it tomorrow take your bed and bedding with you. I'm going home. - Home? - Yes. When will you come back? Now, I won't come here ever again. If I knew that I would be losing everything... ...by coming here, then I would have never come here. What have you lost coming here? I'll tell you if we ever meet again. Take this money. Give whatever I owe to anyone. And give the rest of it to the servants. Take this inside. I will come right away. - Okay? - Okay. Whose letter was it? - It was Parvati Devi's letter. I gave it to her. - Oh! DEVDAS: 'My mind never told me that I love you.' SERVENT: Mother... Parvati's in-laws have come to bless her. PARO'S MOTHER: Paro, hey Paro! [CUCKOO COOING] [WATER BUBBLES] Please wait, Paro. - I've come. - Why? Don't you remember what you said that night? Yes. And even the letter that you wrote. Please forgive me, Paro. I wrote that letter in a haste. I don't know what happened to me. I didn't even have power to think. Shut up! I don't want to listen to all that! Listen, Parvati. I'll make my parents agree. You've parents and I don't? Is it not necessary that they should agree too? But they aren't refusing this, are they? They are refusing. Let me Go! Let go of my way! Paro, have you forgotten me completely? I cannot believe a person who changes his words like you. My parents think for my betterment. Whatever they have done, it is for my own good. Please let me go. Such pride? Why shouldn't I be? You can be proud. Why can't I be? You've talent. I've beauty as well as talent. So what if you're big people? My parents don't beg either. - Paro. - You're thinking that you'll defame me, do it. I'll defame you? How? I had come to you alone that night, isn't it? Spread this word everywhere. You'll be at peace. Listen, Parvati. This form of yours? This beauty is not good. One becomes too haughty due to this. You do know that even the moon has some spots. So he has a spot on his face. Come. I'll make a wound on your face too. Devdas! What did you do, Devdas? Don't worry, Paro. This wound will be filled. There'll only be some marks. If anyone ever asks you, lie to them. Or else tell them the truth. - But, Devdas... - Nothing, Paro. I've made a mark to remember... ...our meeting on the last day. So that if you ever see the moon like face in the mirror, ...you might remember me. I'm a fool. Maybe, this is our relation through births. I'll forget you. You know that I'm immature. I don't think and talk. You did good, Paro. Maybe, you'd never be happy with me. Were you dreaming about your in law's place at the bank? Oh! I'm dead! What happened? Oh mother! You're about to be married? How did all this happen? Nothing, mother. I slipped on the bank. I fell down. Why child? Why are you sitting so glum? I've heard that you're getting... ...married to some big overseer? Do you remember? You gave us three rupees when you were a kid. I had told you. You will be the queen of some king. Wasn't what I said true? STREET SINGER: You will have to give us good alms today. "The maiden now belongs to the beloved now." "The balcony of the house seems foreign too." "The maiden now belongs to the beloved now." "The maiden now belongs to the beloved now." "Her mother's houses paths seem so lonesome now." "Her mother's houses paths." "She doesn't like her childhood friends now." "She doesn't like." "Dreams are settled in her eyes now?" "She doesn't like the buds of her garden now." "Every breath seems to be the message of the beloved." "She doesn't like mother's house now." "The maiden now belongs to the beloved now." "The maiden now belongs to the beloved now." "The fire in her heart is increasing every moment." "Increasing every moment." "The nerves of her body are getting irritated." "The nerves of her body..." "We know all that goes in everyone's mind." "She belongs to her beloved now." "Her unmarried life seems so stark to her." "She doesn't like mother's house now." "The maiden now belongs to the beloved now." "The maiden now belongs to the beloved now." "Radhe..." "Radhe..." [PLAYING MUSIC INSTRUMENTS] I feel like calling Devdas once and show him this golden face. Is it possible, sister? Can I touch his feet's once? Forget him. I've heard that the heartless person has gone to Calcutta. [SLEIGH BELL] Hey, Devdas, you've come once again? - When did you come? - Yesterday. Yesterday? Then where were you all day and night? - I was in the park. - In the park? Have you gone crazy? What has happened to you? Have you fought with dad? No. So, have you fought with someone else? Oh! I forgot that you're aren't married. So how can you fight with anyone? Chunni. The place where you go. Does all the sadness really go away there? Yes. But that place is not good. What is good and bad? All is useless. Take me there with you. O sad one, come let me embrace you... ...you too have been betrayed in love. I don't have problems in taking you there. But it will be better if you don't go there. I'll go there, certainly. It's your wish. Come on. Parvati, go into the palanquin... Get down. Devdas, what happened? Wow. What is your name? "My beloved, refused to take me home." "My beloved, refused to take me home." "My beloved..." Come on. - When did you come? - You won't miss me, right? I came here regularly. I haven't noticed you... - ...are you angry with me? - No, no, nothing as such. Come, Dev. Let's go. Which unfortunate place have you brought me? DEVDAS: I'm choking here. Who is he? He is the bone of contention. Why did you stop? You stopped, my heart stopped as well. Due to sadness, the sky bowed down too. Hey Devdas, where are you going? Why are you scared? Sit down. Sit down. Yes, start now. "At the feet of the beloved..." "At the feet of the beloved..." "I've kept the heart as a gift." - "He lifted it and said." - What? "It's your wish as of now." "My beloved, my lover, my torturer." "It's your wish as of now." "It's your wish as of now." "It's your wish as of now." "It's your wish as of now." "Don't ask me why there are so many sitting in here." "Don't ask me why there are so many sitting in here." "I have lost my senses because of you." "I have lost my senses because of you." "Our life is on our lips and we have lost our heart." "We have even hoped and we're waiting." Really? "It's your wish as of now." "It's your wish as of now." "My beloved, my lover, my torturer." "It's your wish as of now." "It's your wish as of now." "It's your wish as of now." "It's your wish as of now." Wow! Applause... Wow, clap... [INDISTINCT] "There is a storm of the emotions of love in the heart." "There is an ambition to live and die too." "Oh, sir." "It's your wish as of now." "It's your wish as of now." "My beloved, my lover, my torturer." "It's your wish as of now." "It's your wish as of now." "It's your wish as of now." "It's your wish as of now." Very good. Live till the time you can. Take this. Greetings, greetings. It is as you wish. Come on... - Come on. - Come on. - Come on. - Come on. - We'll have to go? Come on. - Yes. [SINGING SONG IN BACKGROUND] - Where are you off too? - I'm going out. - Please go out from here. No it's not. - The way out here is not here. Okay. Come on. Where are you off too? Sit here for a minute. I'll get a cigarette and come back. [ANKLETS CLINKS] [BANGLES CLINKS] What kind of an insolent woman are you? Do you take money? When the dirt of your feet have... I'm not speaking about feet, I'm speaking about money. Do you take money? Yes. I do. Or else, what is our work? Enough. I don't want to hear any further. [FOOT STEPS] Devdas! [GALLOP] [LAUGHING] - Did Devdas leave? - Yes. Look at this. Give this back to him. Why should I return it to him? He has given it to you with his own happiness. No. He gave it with anger and left because we take money. - Chunni, will you do something for me? - What? Can you bring him here once more? But he hasn't come to such places before. And I don't think that he will ever come again too. But why are you asking about him? Just like that. I want to see him once again. You've fallen in love. You don't know Chunni. He is the first man who gave me money without any reason. - You didn't understand? - I do understand. There are others who are greedy for money. Not you. But, what is the real matter? What can I tell you? I like him a bit. In five minutes? "My gaze locked with him." Forget your jokes. You bring him. You will, won't you? What do I know? - For my sake. - Is that the matter? Then I'll surely try. Dharamdas. Deva, mother has sent me with this letter. You came here without listening or talking. Mother is crying so much since that time. Here you're. She has sent money. Come on. Come home. You go back. I'll not come home. Come, daughter-in-law. Come, my dear. Take care of your house. MAHENDRA: Mother, I'm your elder son, Mahendra. I'm your elder son. I greet you. It's been two years since we lost our mother. We have spent these two years... ...with such pain and sadness. You've come now, mother. Please bless me so that our life is happy. And where is daughter Yashoda? What? She has gone to her in laws. I wrote a letter as well. But she, she couldn't come. She couldn't come? Or she didn't want to come? I don't know about it properly, mother. - But if father goes and brings her... - No! Why should he go? Why shouldn't we mother and son go and bring her? Then why should you go? I'll go and bring her. No! Let me go. I won't go. Don't say like that, why won't you go? Come on! Come, daughter. Come. Why daughter? Are you angry with your mother? No. Why should I be angry? Sit down. What is this? Nothing. It is just a gift of your mother. This is your father's house, this is such a huge house. There are so many servants needed in this house. Even I'm nothing else but a servant. Daughter... Is it good of a male or female slave to get angry? No, mother. I beg of you. Don't pay attention to my crimes. - Did you like the new mother? - I liked her. Should I tell her what all you told about her? No, brother. I beg of you. Don't say anything to mother. Parvati... You got me freed from a big shame. You've accepted the son, daughter and everyone. You've even fixed Mahendra's marriage. God bless you. May you be happy always! What are you saying? If only I could explain it to you, Parvati. - This is not good. Whatever I did. - What did you not do good? What can I tell you? I think... That you aren't fit in my house. What is there about fitting? Whether we fit or not, it is one and the same. What is the matter? What happened to you? Nothing has happened to me. Please, at least say something. There isn't anything that can be said. Then listen to me. - Yes? - Come with me. - Where? - Where you'd gone that day. I don't like it there, Chunni. Okay. Are you going there? I am. If you say so, I won't go there. No, I won't say that. But with what hope do you go there? What do you get there? I don't get anything. I just go there to spend my time. Does your time get spent? I can't spend it even if I want to. [SIGHS] Then, come with me then. I'll make such an arrangement for you... ...that you won't pass your time, you will make it run. "Oh! The one who is about to come...'' "Please wait for some time." "The road is waiting, there are a thousand sorrows outside." "Oh! The one who is about to come...'' "Please wait for some time." "The road is waiting, there are a thousand sorrows outside." "Oh! The one who is about to come...'' "Come. I'll settle you in my eyes." "I'll take you in my colorful embrace." "Come. I'll settle you in my eyes." "I'll take you in my colorful embrace." "I'll give you my life and my heart." "O immature one, o shy one!" "Please wait for some time." "The road is waiting, there are thousand sorrows outside." "Oh! The one who is about to come...'' "The magic of the night is scattered." "The aroma of the tresses is scattered." "The magic of the night is scattered." "The aroma of the tresses is scattered." "Understand the signal of the heart." "The one who makes me suffer." "Please wait for some time." "The road is waiting, there are thousand sorrows outside." "The one who makes me suffer." "Lose yourself in the rhythm of the anklet." "Lose yourself in the world of dreams." "Lose yourself in the rhythm of the anklet." "Lose yourself in the world of dreams." "Stay here, o my guest..." "The one who makes me uncomfortable." "Please wait for some time." "The road is waiting, there are a thousand sorrows outside." "Oh! The one who is about to come..." "Oh! The one who is about to come..." "Oh! The one who is about to come..." "Oh! The one who is about to come..." [SLURPING] What can I tell you? It is my duty to tell you the truth. He is very ill. Give him the medicine that I've told you to. It is God's wish after that. What are you waiting for now, son? Please give this message to Deva. How can I tell him? I should know his whereabouts. So please go and bring him yourself. What are you talking about, mother? How can I leave father in such a delicate situation? We will send him a letter through Dharamdas... ...he will search for him somewhere or the other. [HUMMING] [HUMMING] Please don't drink anymore, Devdas. Why? It is a few days ago that you started drinking. You won't be able to tolerate it. Who is the fool who drinks to tolerate? I drink so that... So that I can just breathe... And... ...I don't have the strength to get up and go from such a place. Therefore I just stay here. I just, keep looking at your face. Even then I don't become totally unconscious. There is some consciousness left in me. Tell consciousness... ...I should never be able to gain consciousness ever. Devdas, there are some people who come here... ...and don't even touch alcohol? They don't even touch alcohol? If I had a gun. I'd shoot them down. They are more sinners than me, Chandramukhi. First of all, I won't stop drinking. And if I do stop drinking. I'll not come back here. I'll not come back here. I've a cure. But, what will happen of those people... ...who do not drink but still come here. I don't know how sad I was... ...when I started drinking. Don't touch me. Don't touch me, Chandramukhi. I'm still in my senses. You don't know how much I hate you. And, I'll always hate you. Even then... ...I'll come to you, sit with you and talk to you. There is no other cure than this. Will you people be able to understand this? People commit crimes in darkness... ...and I come here and drink liquor in the light of day. And all of you... ...are the living pictures of tolerance. Chandramukhi tells me that she loves me. But I didn't want that. I didn't want that. No. People are a farce. They put black lime on their face. They become kings and they become queens. They fall in love. And God knows... ...they make such pretense in that love. And it seems as if all that is the truth. Even Chandramukhi is a farce. And I keep on seeing. Even then... Even then I miss Paro a lot! All was over within a moment. She went on the path of marriage. And I walked on the path of destruction. A never ending farce has started now. Devdas... Who? Is it Parvati? You're not Paro. Then why are you crying? One, small mistake... And such a huge punishment for that? Why do I remember Paro all the time? Why can't I forget her? [INDISTINCT] Yes? Come on. Go and sleep. Sleep? I'm a drunkard. And she is one... Okay, it is good. Let it be. What is bad in that? There is no hope and no faith. There is no happiness and no ambition too. Wow! Very good! Devdas! Devdas. Devdas. Is Devdas there? He is there but he is sleeping. You won't be able to meet him at this time. How will he not meet me? He will have to meet me. Tell me. Where have you hidden him? - I won't let him live in this hell. - DEVDAS: Who is it? Devdas! Dharamdas... How did you come here? - DHARAMDAS: Chunni gave me... - Why have you come here? Go away from here, Dharamdas! Go away! I won't go. Please wait, Devdas. There is a letter from the house. The master is no more. - He has left all of us. - [CRYING] Please come home now, Devdas. If not for anyone else, then for your mother, Devdas. - BHIJUDAS: Didn't I tell you? - [CRYING] - How did father go away leaving me? - SERVANT: Brace yourself. No, I don't want to live. What is the need of living now? [CRYING] Please have faith in God. [CRYING] [INDISTINCT] Oh Paro, you came here all of a sudden. No message or any letter. Yes father. I got a letter from sister. She told me that uncle is very ill? He has already expired. I'll offer my condolences, father. Parvati... When did you come from Madhopur? Today. It's been such a long time that I haven't met you. Tell me. Are you all right? - Is Mr. Chaudhary and everyone else all right? - Yes. They are all good. You will stay here for some days now, isn't it? Okay, I'll see you later. Parvati, you've come? It's good. Maybe you'll be able to save Devdas. Why? What has happened, Dharamdas? If only I could tell you. Father expired. He spent a lot of money. - It's very difficult now. - What is difficult? - Tell me. - What do I tell you, Paro... I don't know what has happened to him. He doesn't eat or sleep. It's just bottles of alcohol. I don't know where he stays for these many days. And I've heard... He has made jewellery worth thousands for her. For whom? [DOOR CLOSED] Now, what if I defame you? Yes? Why? Don't you feel ashamed, Paro? But what is the need to be ashamed in this? Two people got together and acted childishly. And then see, so many things happened in between. You said whatever you wished in anger. And, even I made that mark on your forehead. PARO: 'This mark is my happiness and wealth.' This is my only support. Why don't you say anything? I'm very angry on you, Paro. Father is not there. These are such sorrowful days for me. If you were there, would these days be sorrowful? You know sister-in-law. And even brother's attitude isn't hidden from you. In this, tell me. Where will I go with my mother? And then... I don't understand what would happen of me. If you were there, I'd give everything... ...to you and be rest assured, right? Why are you crying, Paro? Okay, forget it. This matter is closed here. No, tell me. I've heard that you've become a proper housewife? A big house and big wealth, big children... ...and even Mr. Chaudhari is big. Everyone is big, isn't it? Will you be able to do something for me? What? Will I be able to get a girl on your side? - Even I feel like settling down. - You want a beautiful girl? Yes. Just like you. You want her to be from a good family? No. I want her to be very wretched. - Who can fight with me like you. - I'm worthless. I don't know how many will come... ...to your feet and think of themselves to be lucky. I don't want thousands. Only one will be enough now. - Devdas... - Yes? Can I tell you something? Tell me. Why did you put this habit of drinking alcohol? - Who told this to you? - Whoever tells it to me. Is this the truth? Yes. This is the truth. And you've made jewellery worth thousands for her? I've just made them now. I didn't give them to her. Will you take it? Give it to me. Look, I don't have jewellery on my body. Mr. Chaudhary has not given you any jewellery? He did give it to me. But I gave it to his daughter. Maybe, you don't need it, Paro. And, what you've heard is not true, Paro. I don't love anyone else. Okay. Promise me one thing. You'll never drink again. - I cannot do this, Paro. - Why? Can you promise that you will never miss me? I've work downstairs, Paro. I'll leave. No. - You promise me first. - I cannot promise you, Paro. Why can't you do it? Can everyone do everything? If one wishes to do, they can surely do it. - So, will you be able to elope with me tonight? - Devdas! It's evening. Go home now, Paro. Promise me, first. What's good in taking a forcible promise? It's possible that I won't be able to keep it tomorrow after today. Open the door, Paro. - Parvati... - Devdas, I'm choking. Do I not know it? I'm unfortunate. I couldn't serve you. Come over to my place. There is nobody to look after you. Your house? Will you look after me there? This is my prayer throughout life, my God. Please fulfil this wish of mine. Even if I die after this, it doesn't matter to me. - Please come to my house. - I'll go. Swear on me and tell me. Will you come? I'll never forget this thing, Paro. If your sorrow is lessened by you serving me... ...then I'll certainly come. I'll come at least once. [PLAYING MUSIC INSTRUMENTS] [CONCH BLOWING] Come in daughter-in-law. Come, my dear. Mother, some beggars are creating commotion outside the gate. Some of them didn't get the clothes yet. Why didn't they get it? When everyone has got it then they'll get it too. Go and tell the clerk he will get it arranged. Okay, mother. We are poor we should get some clothes. Silence please. Mother has said that everyone will get clothes. Hail queen mother! Hail queen mother! BEGGERS: Hail queen mother! Hail queen mother! [DOOR KNOCKS] - Does Chandramukhi live here? - Yes. Come in. Why is the room like this? Where is Chandramukhi? You? What have you done to yourself? What condition? I feel as if my life has become bright. You've forgotten me so soon? You seem to be weak, were you sick? Physically I am fit. You haven't adorned yourself. The house also looks bare. What's all this? I have sold everything. And all the music system? I have left everything. The outside room has changed completely. Not only outside but from within too. Come... - Doesn't Chunni come anymore? - No... It's been two months that he hasn't come. He fought and went away. I've heard... ...that he has taken a job outside Calcutta. What did he fight over? He had come here to earn commission. I threw him away. Commission for what? You too! You don't understand anything. He had brought a very rich man. Five hundred rupees per month. So much jewellery. A guard at the door for security. Where is all that? I can't see them. You'd see them if I'd let them stay. - I made all of them run away. - Their fault? They weren't at fault. I didn't like it. Ever since you went away from here nobody has come here. So you've stopped your shop? Yes. I'm ruined now. Isn't it? So, how will you lead your life? It won't help if I live in the city. I'm thinking of shifting to some cheaper place now. Then why didn't you go till now? I was just here in the hopes of seeing you. I knew that you'd come here once. Only in the hopes of seeing me? Why? You hated me a lot, isn't it? Nobody hated me so much before this. God knows how many people came and went before this. But I didn't see that glow on the face which you had. God knows what you did as soon as you came. I changed myself totally. CHANDRAMUKHI: These eyes started seeing everything differently. Then you started drinking alcohol. And I hate alcohol. If anyone loses his senses after drinking, I get very angry. But when you used to lose your senses, I used to cry. One day, you asked me how much we tolerate. That day I was proud of myself and left everything. You've left everything, Chandramukhi. But the women's minds are always changing. Devdas, has Parvati hurt you a lot? Why do you ask this? I've dealt in love for many days in my life, Devdas. But, I've loved only one. Loving is different and the lust for beauty is something else. How much lust for beauty exists in the men... ...we women don't have that much. You people come and express your love. You always go to town about it. Whenever we bow our head and... ...accept this new life. But even at that time... ...we do not understand the true meaning of love. After that, at some different time... ...the hidden anger in our heart comes out in the open, at that time you people shout and term us... - ...blotted ones and infidels. - Chandramukhi. Please don't worry, Devdas. I'm not speaking about your Parvati. Maybe, Parvati is very beautiful. But even then I've not been able to find out... ...that she must have fallen in love with you first. She must have expressed this on you that she loves you. On my side, I found out how much Parvati loves you. What did you say? Devdas, I'm not saying all this on my side. I'm trying to tell you all this in lieu of Parvati. What can be more anger worthy than this? When a person doesn't love someone... ...and then, that same person sits down to tell him the story of love. Okay, I'll leave now. Please sit for some more time. I never met you in your senses. I've never spoken to you like this. Before this, till the time you didn't... ...drink and get all inebriated, you didn't look at my face. Now, I cannot even touch alcohol for some time. My father has expired. Will you drink later? I cannot say anything. If possible, don't drink at all. Don't destroy this life. Okay. I'll leave now. Bless me that I'll stay happy. Wherever you go Chandramukhi, do inform me. And if you need anything don't think twice before telling me. Manorama... - Are you okay? - Yes. I feel happy when I see people. Okay. Bless you. [BIRDS TWEET] MANORAMA: 'Ever since you've gone, the map of the village has changed.' 'The overseer has expired. Devdas comes here.' 'But he comes here only to fight with his brother.' 'And to take money. As soon as he gets the money he goes away.' 'It's two and a half years that his father has expired.' 'In this time, he has spent half of his money.' 'I tell you, Paro.' 'God did good that you didn't marry him.' 'He has come to the village nowadays.' 'He moves around and kills sparrows all day.' 'When his head starts spinning due to intense heat...' '...he sits down under some tree and thinks about something.' 'It seems as if it is something bad.' "Oh, beloved." "Oh, beloved," "it's the fire..." "...within the heart." "Oh, beloved." "The beloved hasn't come." "It's the fire within the heart." "What kind of inextinguishable fire is this?" "The heart is restless and so are the eyes." "The heart is restless and so are the eyes." "The heart is restless and so are the eyes." "And, see, there are many a birds on every branch." "The way is lost as only the tears are left." "Oh, beloved." "Oh, beloved." "Oh, beloved." Mahendra. Mahendra. - What is it, mother? - Arrange for a palanquin and drivers. I'll go to my mother's village right now. But mother, father has gone on a round. It's Ram Navmi tomorrow. The Brahmins have been invited... Enough. I know everything. Do as I say right now. - It's necessary for me to go right now. - Okay, mother. PARO: Faster please. Dharamdas, where is Devdas? I told him not to but he didn't listen to me. He went to Calcutta by the train in the morning. He went away? Hey... Did you go to the post office? Yes, mother. But there is no letter. It's been three months. He didn't write any letter. And, neither has he sent any answer. [CROW CAWS] Bhairav... How far is Tarsonapur's overseer's house from here? It must be about a kilometer or so. The overseer has expired now. He has two children now. Bhijudas and Devdas. - Can you take me there? - Why not? Whenever you wish to. Not whenever. Come right now. You get ready. Okay. "Walk towards the destination." "Walk along with the palanquin without a break." "Somewhere, there is shade..." "...and there is heat somewhere." "Walk towards the destination." "Walk along with the palanquin without a break." "Even this..." "...is a form." "Even that is a form..." "Walk towards the destination." "Walk along with the palanquin without a break." "Many people will be lost here." "Many travellers will come here." "Many travellers will go here." "Many travellers will come here." "Walk along with the palanquin without a break." "Travellers." "Walk along with the palanquin without a break." "Many travellers will go here." "Many travellers will come here." "Walk towards the destination." "Walk along with the palanquin without a break." "Walk towards the destination." "Many travellers will come here." Why didn't you come day before yesterday? My child was ill. There will be illnesses in your house always. But who will do the work in our house? Beware if you take off even for a single day! Greetings mother. Who are you? I'm your people. I've come to give the rent. Sit down. Where do you stay? I stay in Khedegaon, your area. Why mother? The ownership is between two partners, isn't it? Yes, child. All of it will be ours in a couple of days. The younger one has sunk the boat. He used all his money in Calcutta on alcohol and prostitutes. Is there any account as to how much money he spent? So does the younger one never come home? He came that day. He fought with the elder brother... ...took some five thousand rupees and went away. - When will he come again? - I don't know. We don't even know whether he will come or not. God knows what all illnesses he has. And now there is no hope of surviving for him too. Where does he stay in Calcutta? No idea as to where he stays now. He eats in some hotel and lies in some rented place. What else can he do? He knows and his life knows. Okay, mother. I'll leave. She has come to give the rent. Take her to the court. Mother, I'll go myself. Parvati... I wished to tell you something since so many days. Tell me. You've such nice sarees and dresses... Even then why do you wear such common clothes Parvati? Just like that? And those jewels. What are those kept for? - I gave them to Yashoda. - That was good. But I had them made again for you. Even then why do you move around like a saint? Why do you say that I move around like a saint? The way you move around being so simply dressed, just like that, I stay too. Forget about me. I'm old. You aren't old. Wear some jewellery or something. I don't like ornaments. Sister... - Who is it? - Chameli? Come. Close the door and come. [PLAYING TABLA] Wow, so beautiful... You are looking so ravishing today. What is the matter today? You went away becoming a sage one day. And you've come back once again today? I'm going to search for my beloved. Your beloved? Who is he? You'll find out when he comes. Oh! I understand. [DOOR KNOCKS] Here. Maybe he has come. I'll leave. I've come! Who are you? [LAUGHING] You, you're someone else. But you cannot be compared too! - Get lost from here. - What did you say? - I told you, go away from here. - Out! Now, can I ask you why I was chucked out? No. I'm just asking. What is it? You didn't give me any answer... [SINGING SONG IN BACKGROUND] Mohana, does any man named Devdas ever come here? Devdas? Devdas who? He is talented and rich, he is very good. His eyes are glowing. He spends a lot of money. No, sister. When does something like this happen to us? [SINGING SONG IN BACKGROUND] "What did I know?" Stop it. Stop the car. "Those days would come too!" Devdas... "What did I know?" "Who thought about it?" "Those days would come too!" - "Would..." - Devdas... "Even life will be difficult." "And death will be impossible." Devdas... Yes. Why are you lying here? Come on home. "Ruined hearts like us..." "What is life and death for us?" "Today, we will rise from the party." "Tomorrow, we will rise from the world." Will you've some drinks? Yes. Where will I get it? Come on. I'll arrange for it. Where did you come from, my friend? Wow, you're beautiful. You are very beautiful. Yes, very beautiful, come on. We will leave. [BOTTLE CLINKS] Do you recognise me, beautiful? Yes. I do recognize you. Come on. [INDISTINCT] Where have you brought me? Okay come on. Give me the alcohol. - I don't have any alcohol. - You don't? Then why did you bring me here? You just fooled me? Get it from anywhere. Go. You shouldn't drink. Who are you to give me suggestions? Give it to me. Or else, I'll leave from here. Please don't go. You're ill... I'll go to hell from here. How are you concerned with it? I'm not well... Sit down, I'll get it to you right away. Look at me dance till then. Should I see your dance? "The one which you will accept..." "From where will I get that drink?" "The one which your heart will like..." "Where do I get that song from?" "The one which you will accept..." "I'm that flower..." "Which everyone has gone trampling." "My age has drowned in my tears." "I'm that flower..." "Which everyone has gone trampling." "My age has drowned in my tears." "Where should I get the cloud which will rain like monsoon?" "The one which your heart will like..." "Where do I get that song from?" "The one which you will accept..." "You wish someone else. I hope for you." "You've sadness in your heart." "My heart is a temple just for you." "You wish someone else. I hope for you." "You've sadness in your heart." "My heart is a temple just for you." "The one that will settle our hearts." "Where should I get that medicine from?" "The one which your heart will like..." "Where do I get that song from?" "The one which you will accept..." "It's my helplessness. My sighs don't have any effect." "Even if I asked for death, I didn't get it from his face." "It's my helplessness. My sighs don't have any effect." "Even if I asked for death, I didn't get it from his face." "From where should I get the hope which will be listened?" "The one which your heart will like..." "Where do I get that song from?" "The one which you will accept..." "Where do I get that song from?" "The one which your heart will like..." "Where do I get that song from?" "The one which you will accept..." From where did you steal me yesterday? I didn't steal you, you were lying on the road... ...and so brought it here. And why did you start all this again? You're wearing jewels like a new bride. - Who gave it to you? - Once again? I was just joking. Nobody has given them and neither have I made them. All of them are fake. I'm sitting here for you. I took this house. I paid the rent. I bought all these jewellery. I had to spend so much money for you. And it's you. You didn't recognise me yesterday. I didn't recognise you. But when I heard you I did suspect. All I thought was... Who can serve me like this unless it's my Chandramukhi... Devdas, do you still hate me that much? No, Chandramukhi. Instead I love you. My Chandramukhi... Oh, God. "The full day..." "My beloved has arisen." "My beloved has come home." "My beloved has come home." [GLASS BREAKS] What happened? What happened to you? Did you ruin everything? Do you've pain in your heart? I cannot understand. Lay down, lay down. I'll get the doctor. It seems that your health is all good now. Your medicines have cured me. It's not my medicines. It's her service that has cured you. But don't think that you are fully well now. You'll have to look after your health now. Alcohol is poison for you. If possible, go away from Calcutta for a change. Okay. The doctor has said that you should go somewhere for some days. Who are you of mine that you serve me so much? Haven't you understood it till now? I've understood it. But what does it do too? See, I loved Paro so much. And she loved me too. But the society didn't want that. We didn't get anything accept sorrow. I thought that I'd never fall in such traps again. And I didn't fall in with my own wish. Why did you do like this Chandramukhi? Why did you bind me like this? Maybe even you'll be sad like Parvati. The two of you're so different... ...and yet, both of you're so similar. One is so youthful and enthusiastic... ...and the other is so silent and intelligent. She cannot tolerate anything. You can tolerate anything. She is so respected and you're so defamed. Everyone loves her and everyone hates you. But I don't hate you, Chandramukhi. I cannot hate you. This much is enough for me. I don't want anything else. SERVANT: Mother, the car has come. Take it away. I don't know where I kept the muffler. It's on the chair. Chandramukhi, are you crying? No. Lift your face, lift it. See? I didn't need so many clothes and bed and bags. Whether you need it or not. I know it better than you. - Listen... - Yes. You'll need a servant there. Please take me with you. This isn't possible, Chandramukhi. The people will point you with accusing fingers. And that is what I won't be able to tolerate. I'm very worried. You're ill. How will you go alone to the foreign country? How will you stay? I've written a letter to Dharamdas. He will come to the station to take me. - Will you give me one blessing? - What? Please don't drink any more. I cannot promise you. But I will remember what you say. Listen... Wherever you stay... If your body is even a bit ill, please tell this servant. Okay, Chandramukhi. And see... Keep this with you. No, no. I don't need this now. I know whether you need it or not. Look Chandramukhi... Nothing can be said about life. What are you up to? You keep this with you and don't tell anything. Please wait... When will I meet you again? Who knows? [SINGING SONG IN BACKGROUND] But till the time I'm alive. I'll never forget you. My thirst to see you will never quench. I don't know what the decision makers... ...of good and bad decide about you. But after dying if we do meet... I'll never be able to stay without you. "They will not come and turn back. Whenever we call them." I'll spend this life in wait of that life. "Now the owner of this world..." "If I can meet him somewhere. I'll ask him." "Doing which mistake..." "He troubles me like this!" "Doing which mistake..." "He troubles me like this!" "He won't come to meet me." "He won't come to meet me." Have you decided where you're going to go? No. I haven't decided anything as yet. So why don't you go to Kashi to your mother? No, Dharamdas. I won't go to Kashi. I want to go somewhere far away. [TRAIN RUNNING] CHANDRAMUKHI: 'I've found that...' '...Parvati loves you very much!' PARVATI: 'Now please don't nag me that I came to you secretly.' 'Because I won't be affected with this nag.' Tell me. Where do you want to go? [HAWKERS] I want to run away from here somewhere, Dharamdas. I don't understand what you're saying. Dharamdas. I won't have food, you bring... ...something for yourself from the station. Why will you not eat food? What about the fever? - No... - You've fever? If you torment yourself so much then what will happen? I'm telling you. If you keep travelling... ...like this day and night, I will go back to the village. - Go. Go if you can go. - [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Yes. You know that I cannot leave you alone. Therefore you're troubling me like this. But I won't listen to anything that you say. I'll get down on any big station... ...tomorrow morning and take you to a doctor. This everyday fever is not good. Dharamdas... - Put this light off. - Okay. [SWITCH CLICK] It's too late now. Sleep. I'll go to my room. [WHISTLING] [TRAIN HORN HONKS] - Devdas... - Hey, Chunni! You? What have you done to yourself? I cannot even recognise you now. What is going on? The thing that is going on is that I'm alive. What is going on with you? I didn't like Calcutta. I am doing a job in Delhi. I'm moving around for that matter. Today here and there tomorrow. Where are you going? - I haven't decided anything about that. - Objective? There is no objective in life now, Chunni. You're that same Devdas. Okay, wait. We have met after so many days. Why shouldn't we make our meeting colorful? What do you say? Now I don't have any patience to add soda. Why should money be wasted on soda? But, you'll find it hard. Mix some water in it. I do not drink anymore, Chunni. Did someone give you a swear in? It's nothing like that. I won't drink now. But where are you taking the glass? If you don't drink. I'll drink. Is it the old illness or some new illness? Why don't you say something? What should I say? I don't like anything. I just like that I shouldn't like anything. I know what your sorrow is, Devdas. But don't think that you're the only one who has this sorrow. When the fire of this sorrow ignites the heart... ...you've to take its help. This fire can extinguish that fire. There is no other solution. Devdas, have some more. Yes drink some more. Oh! I've to get down here. I will leave this bottle here. Hey... If we stay alive, we will meet again, isn't it? Why doesn't this thirst quenched? This never ending thirst. Devdas? Devdas! What happened, Devdas? Deva, did you drink again? Why did you? I couldn't stand it, Dharamdas. Your body is on fire. We will get down on this station. I'll show you to some doctor here. No. Please don't stop me. Dharamdas. Let this train move. Please don't drink now, Devdas. Didn't the doctor tell you not to? If you drink another drop of liquor, you'll die. I'll die even if I don't drink, Dharamdas. How is the fever? Lot... What can I do. Deva? Your fever doesn't decrease. It's time for me to go now. Time to go where? From this world. Don't talk like this, for God's sake. Don't talk like this, Deva. Why are you crying now? What should I do if not cry? You think that I am stone hearted? I beg to you. Please come back. Where? To whom? Who do I've in this world? What are you saying? You've everyone. Yes. I've everyone. It's me who doesn't belong to anyone. Don't say like that. I can't hear all that. Mughal Sarai is next. We will get down and go to mother. - Mother? - Yes, mother. I'm a good for nothing, drunkard. I won't show this face to mother, Dharamdas. Deva, please come to the village at least. The village? Yes. It's all right. This shallow body belongs to that same village. This... This... You take me there. [COUGHING] Blood... - Mother! What happened mother? - Mother! - What happened, madam? - Mother! Blood! [TRAIN HORN HONKS] The people getting down at Pandua, Dirpur, Manikpur, Mirgunj. The people getting down at Pandua, Dirpur, Manikpur, Mirgunj. The people getting down at Pandua, Dirpur, Manikpur, Mirgunj. DEVDAS: 'If your pain is decreased by serving me, I'll come to you.' 'I'll come to you before I die once.' [WHISTLING] [COUGHS] [TRAINS MOVES] [TRAIN HORN HONKS IN DISTANCE] Driver, hey driver... Will you go to Manikpur? Manickpur? It's very far from here. And the road is very bad too. I won't go so late in the night. Sleep in the car today. I'll take you tomorrow morning. I don't have that much time, brother. What? See... I've to go there. I'll give you a lot of money. Take me there. Come on. Please sit, sir. Come on. Come on. Sit down. How much more do we have to travel? Sir, you've just sat in the car right now. We have to go too far away now. Come on! [WHIPS] PARO: 'Devdas...' DEVDAS: 'Paro, I'll come back in the holidays.' 'You've grown up.' DRIVER: 'Come on!' DEVDAS'S MOTHER: 'Devdas...' Mother... 'Devdas...' 'Deva, where are you going?' 'I'm going to Calcutta, mother.' 'Devdas.' 'When will we meet again?' 'Please give me some space at your feet.' Will this road ever end? DRIVER: It will end sir. It will certainly end. [WHIPS] [PLAYING MUSIC INSTRUMENTS] Sir. We have reached Manikpur. This is the overseer's apartment. Where do you want to go? Sir, have you slept? Sir. Have you slept? Sir. We have reached Manikpur. Whose house do you want to go to? Why don't you speak? What happened, sir? DEVDAS: Paro... Paro, I've come. I've come, Paro. Paro. I've come. Who is it? Paro... Why are you standing here? Someone called me. What are you saying? Who will call you so late in the night? Then? Look at this sir. It's not my fault. He has travelled all throughout the night. [SANSKRIT CHANTS] [SANSKRIT CHANTS] Shamu's mother. Why are so many people gathered outside? I heard that some traveller is on that road since morning. He will stay for a few minutes more. [SANSKRIT CHANTS] [SANSKRIT CHANTS] What happened? Nothing. [SANSKRIT CHANTS] [TEMPLE BELL] You don't seem to be well today. Go and rest up there. God knows why he had come here? He came here just to die. Do you know where he was living? I've heard that he lived in Tarksurapur. Who lived in Tarksurapur? Mistress, a man died outside just now. We were speaking about him. - What was his name? - I don't know. Sir is coming from there, he must know it. Mahendra, who was he? I didn't find out properly. But I think that someone from your... ...village with the name of Devdas Mukherjee expired. Who? MAHENDRA: Devdas of your village. How did you know it? There were two letters in his pocket? - One was of Bhijudas Mukherjee. - Yes. His elder brother. One was of Harimati from Kashi. His mother! There was a diamond ring in his hand. - Yes, uncle has given it to him. - Where are you going? The people have taken him away by now. Mahendra. Devdas... MAHENDRA: Mother! Mother! [INDISTINCT] - Mother... - What happened? What has happened to her? Has she gone mad? - Parvati. - Devdas... Mother! Mother! Stop her. Stop her. - PARO'S HUSBAND: Close the door. Close the door! - Devdas. "Beloved..." "Oh, beloved." Synced by Anomix33
