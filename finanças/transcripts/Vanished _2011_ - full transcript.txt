Maybe we should go to the media. - After what they've been saying? What about Jack? - I know darling, but, we need them on our side. - Forgive my boldness, but where is Mr. Hill? - He's under a lot of pressure, alright? - Someone out there knows who this is. And we need them to come to us. We need to reach out to them. Mrs. Hill, if we go to the media the underlying message has to be twofold. And B, you'll take no further action. It's been two weeks now. - Okay. Okay. - Alright! This is a fragile situation so let's keep the questions on task. Now let's help these people get their boy back. We've heard kidnapping. - Yeah that part's true, but communication's stopped. - Please if you're watching this we just want you to make contact with us again. We just want our son back. Can you tell us about your son? - Our son Caleb is five. He's five years old. He was last seen A, you will pay the money. And his jeans. He's a really, really happy kid. You just want your son back. Just be patient with him. How did you miss him Surely he knows better than to go with a stranger. - This is the person who we believe is responsible for the kidnapping, if anybody knows anything they should contact us immediately. Wearing a yellow T-shirt, and a black jacket, His beautiful personality. He's very, very bright for his age. He asks a lot of questions, so please if you were with him at the time? - Winona! Winona!

Rear entrance, find the public toilets. Stay on it for 10 minutes, you'll come through the gates, Yes, yes, of course. - Yes, hello. Caterina, are you ready? Good girl. - I've got the money. Good, now listen carefully. Mortimer Street car park. If I smell a single pig, your son is fucking dead, move! Hello? Caterina? Yes? Who the fuck is that following you? Bullshit. Mommy! You fucking stupid bitch, you just killed your son. You're not here. - No I see it. - Sorry, sorry. - I see it, give me a minute. Caleb! Hello! Who? The fucking man in orange. I don't know! Caleb! You called the cops! I'm sorry, please you can have the money. Say goodbye. Just let him go. Bye. Bye, bye, bye mommy. Please don't this isn't a game, please. - Wait, wait, wait honey. Let's see if they've got a torch in the car. Let's ask 'em. Okay. - He's not here. Where are they? Where the fuck are they? What the fuck is going on? Where the fuck? - Come on. They've gone. In here, in this sliding door. What the fuck? What? Shit. Oh God. - We need to leave right now. - But she was here. - Right now. Hunter where are you? I'm here. I'm here!

Let's move. - Do you want us to stay? - Where is our daughter? Please don't hurt Emily. - We're ready. - Good, clean up their car. - Hey! Get out of it. Listen, what do you want? Huh? We've got no money. I'm an electrician, and Winona's a researcher. Now fucking let us go! - What's your name? Hunter, Hunter O'Shaunessey. - What's your name? - Winona, Winona Gant. - Winona Gant. Who the hell are you, hmm? - I'm a woman looking for some people. Yeah, who? - People named Winona and Hunter. - Well we're not them. We don't know you. - Here's a thought. It's mine. - Please, please. What are you doing? What did you just do to her you crazy fucking bitch? This isn't your story. Hang in there. Stay with me. - Why do you think you're here? 'Cause you're insane and you kidnap strangers. Fucked if I know just let us go! - Shut up! Shut up! She knows. She knows. Winona? - Money, but you've got the wrong family. Like he said, we're not rich. - Maybe you're right, maybe you're right. Maybe I have got the wrong Winona and Hunter. Alright. Answer these questions, get 'em right, and you can go. What day is it? - Day? - Day. - It's Saturday. - What time is it? Hold on baby, hold on baby. The cops are coming okay? - Have you ever committed a serious crime? - What? - Murder. - No. - No, you're telling the truth. Either that or you're a great liar. - I've answered your questions, we're not who you're looking for. - You know ever since you have started talking you have done nothing but deny, Winona. Guilty people deny. Innocent people, they ask questions. - What should I be asking? - Who, who am I? When you know the who everything else will be obvious. - I don't know, maybe 11:00 or 12:00. You don't remember me, but you remember that. You wanted to leave the second you saw it. I am looking for the woman who kidnapped and murdered my son! Maybe this will help your amnesia, watch. Say something. Caleb. I've got to hold him. - Who'll find me now? For God's sakes. Down through the leg trick, never been done before. One, two, it went under the leg. Okay. Let's just say for a moment that I believe you. Caleb? Jack! - Caleb! That video doesn't prove anything. I'm not who you're looking for. - You made one mistake, one tiny little mistake. See this background? Looks harmless right? Except when you stare at it for months. You see things, small things. The tiniest little details. Mommy. Caleb. I didn't kill my son! I have your son. I can feel him, I can feel him. Mommy! - There were 46 stores that sold that poster. I went to every single one of them. Until I found one, with the same edge. The same mark. Then I knew. You were a student at that campus. He's not here. For awhile I was certain you would see me, and run. I'd almost given up. Until August the 1st. Latte. Table four your eggs. Thank you. I can't explain it. Somehow I knew you had killed my son. I could feel it. - Mrs. Hill, we recovered a body this morning. Which I have every reason to believe is your son. I'm so very sorry. - Where'd you find him? - The river. - And so where is he now? - He's with the coroner. Look I think it's best if we deal with the identification and all the formalities. - No, I want to see him. I have to see him. Sergeant, Sergeant! There's something I need to show you. So you gonna arrest her? - Mrs. Hill. - What? - Let me tell you your legal position. - Oh you have got to be kidding, she's right there. - Look I can't arrest her. And maybe she'll be held until the trial. If she doesn't get bail. Which she probably will. And then it's the Commonwealth's job, your job, to prove that she's the girl in the grainy photos. - I know it is the girl in the photo. - And in the tape. - I know it is the woman on the tape. - Beyond a reasonable doubt. If you think you can prove it, I'll arrest her right now. - No. - Do you need some help? - The pills don't work anymore. - No, I mean help. There's a bloke I know. He'll help you. - Drucker said you found 'em. - Yes, I did. - You're sure you want to step into this? It's a dark place. Making 'em pay won't bring him back. Won't fill the emptiness, it doesn't. - I have to do something. If I don't one day she'll feel safe enough to do it again. - Come on. No! No fuck it. - Oh my God. What have you done with her? We can cure your sickness. No, no! No, no, no! - This is the price of justice. Alright, alright. Alright. Ready? Ready? This will be good. - Go! I want you to listen very carefully. Let me state the obvious, so the obvious can be restated. Exactly. - Caterina. - It's been awhile Winona. You let me state the obvious. You are a mother. - Yes. I have your child. - I know. - Say it. - I'm a mother. And you have my child. Please just don't hurt her. I don't want to hurt your daughter. Just tell me why, why my son? Winona? Why my son? Winona. - Caterina stop. You don't know what your opening. Do you hear? Can you hear? The cracking in the other rooms. What the fuck did you give her? - Tell me more about Emily, your daughter. Emily. - What do you want to know? - Does she like stories. - Yeah, I guess. - What's Emily's favorite story? - She likes a story about a kitten named Holly. - Tell it. Tell it! - Once upon a time there was a girl named Jenny. She was walking through the forest with her father. And they saw a cat, a beautiful cat moaning loudly. What's wrong with the cat she asked her father? He said that it was in pain, that it was dying. He said we have to find the cat's owner. They can take the cat's pain away. And right then a woman with blue eyes appeared from within the forest, she was the cat's owner. She said they'd have to close their eyes and concentrate on the cat's pain. So Jenny closed her eyes and concentrated on the cat's pain. Suddenly she felt the pain that the cat was going through. She not to scream, she didn't want to scare it. Both her and her father concentrated on the cat. And then after a few minutes the pain was gone. Jenny opened her eyes, the cat was looking up at her smiling. They'd made her better. Jenny took the cat home, named her Holly, and they lived happily ever after. - That's Emily's favorite story? - She likes the ending. - True, can't fault a happy ending. Did you read to Caleb? - Yeah. He liked Hansel and Gretel. Then the kids find their way home. When's mom coming? Most days he just slept. Everyday I wanted to call you, I couldn't. Caterina stop. - We'll stop, we'll stop. Before it's too late. - You tell me why? Why my son? - What difference will it make? - Well LSD's working. - She followed every instruction you gave her. Why didn't you just let the kid go? - I couldn't. You and a skeleton. - He's here. - Where? - He's right there behind me. Behind my head. - What are you hiding? - Winona, what are you hiding? - What? - Tell me the truth, the truth Winona, no more lies. - Jenny went looking for strawberries. - What? - They were Holly's favorite thing in the whole world. The rain started to fall, Jenny didn't see any strawberries. She saw her father in the forest, with her sister, Sally. And her mother watching. - Sally? Jenny's sister Sally? Mm hmm. - This is your story. - Winona gave her mother strawberries. Strawberries dipped in rat poison. She went into her sister's room told her everything would be fine. She was doing the right thing. It's what she was shown. - Shown, who showed her this? Who showed her this? Winona, who? - I can't, I can't, I won't. Why don't you just tell me, who? What would I say? What's your name? - My name is Robert Tippleman, I'm the father of this person that you're referring to. Who is she? - A man forgets lots of things but he doesn't forget his kids. Especially if they put 'em in here. Somehow she got the idea that her mother and I were molesting her. The only explanation were some kid stories, fairy tales. Course the cracks went deserting her. I know who's your murderer, and it's not me. - I'm sorry dad, I'm sorry. Start filling, she's not talking. - Hurry up. - Are you ready? - Caterina stop, stop you have no idea what you're opening. Please. Does Emily still suffer from aquaphobia? Go on. No, stop! - No, no, please, please no, no, no! Stop, stop! - Please no, please Caterina no. Please. - Caterina! Stop, look at me now. Please. - Bring her to justice. - Oh my God no! Stop, stop it now. Stop the water no, no! Help me please! - No Emily. Stop it! - Fucking bitch! - Don't hurt her, please don't hurt her. Sorry. Caterina, don't. Stop it. Caleb was found dead November the 15th. No, don't! Get ready to feel that. - Caterina stop! - No! Caleb, stop, Caleb I'll tell you now, I'll tell you everything, stop! - Stop. Come on then. - What if all the vanished had one thing in common. - What? - The woman in the forest. She's real. - You're telling me a demon forced you to kidnap my son? Yeah. Just like it forced you to take Emily. No more lies. - Dig deep enough you'll find her. Going back 400 years. Vanishings, unexplained crimes, kidnappings, you name it. Shirley Stewart, she just snapped one day in '64. Murdering her entire family. Her husband and seven children. What made the case bizarre was the way she killed them. One evil after another. Stabbing her daughter in the heart with a doll. Dismembering her baby with a hacksaw. Then she just vanished, never seen or heard from again. Or Agnes Churchill, in 1966 murdered her daughter, her husband, and his mother with strawberries dipped in cyanide. When they asked her why she did it, she said she couldn't remember. All she remembered was feeling great joy watching them suffocate. There's plenty more like it. Betty Wilson mysteriously slid her parents. Judy Meadows killing her six year old sister. Denise Freeborn strangling her daughter with a fox fur. - You forgot Winona Gant. Murdered her mother, murdered my son. I couldn't. Leave me alone! She's here, where is she? - I tried to help him. Don't. Caterina don't let her win. No, no. Yes? Cat someone's here, check outside now. Do you hear anything? Cat, Cat hurry up! Just relax, there's nothing. It's time. Honey! Honey get up. - Hey, get the fuck away. Emily get up, get up. Give me the keys. Get Emily, get Emily, go! Get in. - You tell me why? Why my son? - Say it! - Mommy. - Now. Mommy. - Again! Mommy? Caleb? The woman in the forest, she's real. I tried to help him. I couldn't. - Pull over. - Emily get out of the car. Get out of the car! It wasn't me. Caterina it wasn't me. - Most often that demon inside is just us. An excuse to live with the horror. - Emily!
