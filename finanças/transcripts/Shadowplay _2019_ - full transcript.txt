Run! Keep running! Run! No! Something on your mind, Anton? Excellent, thank god. You have no idea how important this memorandum is. It is essential to the future of this company. You must tell me how you found it. No big deal. With the evidence at hand. Hmm, you may look like a, an overgrown adolescent, but you have something special. A drink to celebrate? Just the check, please. Of course. Next time, negotiate the price before taking the job. Mr. Keith. Now that you have the memo, what do you intend to do with it? I see you have deduced some other things. But perhaps you should concern yourself with deducing the things you are paid to deduce. What do you say? However, I won't mention it to my friends. I like you, Anton, your father would have been very proud. Why Lah so broke, huh? Don't know, crap pay, maybe. I'll bank this today, you'll get your cut in three this time, this time, I'm only get 10% out of 600 fucking ringgit? Hey, how am I gonna promote you from trainee to partner if you cannot nego, huh, bodo? Hey, I forgot, okay? Geez. - Is this it? - What? You know, being a PI, I'd always imagined it to be... More glamorous, hmm? Grow up, there's no job in the world that doesn't suck. What's that? Violet Horizons by Joseph Tone. What else did he write? Chaos is my Order, Sultan Street Serenade. You know, if it wasn't for this guy, I'd be flipping burgers by now. This work, in real life, the femme fatal is a 250 pound auntie with frizzy hair, and she wants you to find her cute and harmless little poodle. Cute and harmless. Hey, tomorrow I'm off, remember that training job in Sentul, you think you're ready to guard the keys to my little kingdom, in the meantime? Hey, my secondary number, in case, if you get into any shit, which you won't, if you follow my instructions, right, right? Seriously, bro. This job is as boring as any other job. Can't be as boring as house sitting your shit hole. Hey, shit, man. Oh. Look. The turkey is in the oven. Mm. Perks of the job, boy. From across many oceans, the seeker came. As time wore on, the seeker forgot his quest, and sought a new riddle, which led him to the land beyond the Kingdom of Plain Sight. In the Kingdom of the Hidden, he found happiness at last with the princess. And the princess bore a child. But the walls separating the child's two worlds was thin. So the Hidden Ones watched, waiting for the wall to crumble. This all you got so far? For now. Still, I'm impressed you located this one. Midnight Marshal number one, a true collector's item, well done. The trick is to notice something others often miss. And have you noticed something? Have you read this? The Lathe of Heaven, it's about an ordinary man who discovers he has extraordinary powers to alter reality with his dreams. I prefer a mystery. Detective novels for the novel detective. I quite enjoy science fiction. But fantasy, now, there's my favorite genre. Wizards, dragons, and magic, stuff like that? There's so much more to fantasy than that fanboy claptrap. Ah. Yes, classic game book of your genre persuasion. Back in the day, it was quite popular in a series, it's forgotten now. This copy may well be the last one in existence. Any other leads? Well, I'm working on picking up more clues. Just make sure you don't pick up any misleading ones, not everything is as they seem. No author, no publishing house? That's odd. A child's fearful dream of falling is praised as a gift to learn to fly the next night. A long time ago, I lived, worked, and married here, but things didn't work out. Your husband was also a foreigner? No, he was a local. Like I said, we divorced, I left, my company moved me to Thailand, but we had a child, a daughter. Every month, I'd send her money, but I, I never visited until last year. To see your daughter? No, to find her, she went missing, Mr. Shaw, for a year, and the police here? They made no progress whatsoever. My boss, Mr. Dan Hamzi, he's the one you should... But he's not here, is he? You are. I usually find things, Mrs. Numan, not people. Do you know any reason why she'd want to disappear? No. In fact, I don't know anything about my daughter. You see, Lamya, she had difficulties in communicating with others, until she found a way to express herself through her canvas. I found out about this exhibit on the internet, marking the one year anniversary of her disappearance. This is where you can begin. What if she's dead? Then at least I'll have a body to bury, and to mourn. Please, just look at her. As you can see, I can pay very handsomely. Oh, and one more thing. Please be discreet, I'm on a visitor's visa, and, well. You know. Absolutely. It seems strange, I don't know how or why she chose me. I'm not even a licensed private eye. But there felt a deeper meaning. Not that it mattered, for the amount of coin this lady was willing to pony up, I'd find her daughter, her brother, her mother, and her ancestors. Hell of a time for you to bug me. It's important, do you remember Lamya Shahruddin? Yeah, I remember that case. What can I say, sometimes people just disappear. Like me? What do you want, Anton? I need a favor. You still got friends in the police? What do I look like? I need some info from Missing Persons. Oi, you're not gonna do something stupid, right? It's for research, you know me, nosy as hell. So can you help me? Why should I, because of you, I lost my mark. No, you haven't, I saw a woman walk out with a guy to that hotel, your marks, correct? I saw him spinning a room key, and I caught the first two digits, six and one. Now, that hotel only has three digit rooms, and 610 to 619 run across the east facade, with the windows facing out. You should have a good vantage point from the roof of this building, if they don't shut the curtains. Did you renegotiate your pay with Keith? Dan, help me out here, please. Fine. But no funny stuff, hmm? Don't try to play the hero, or some shit. Oi. Feeling stuffy much? The suit makes the man, kiddo. I'll just give that a tug there. There you go, nothing fancy, like a Windsor knot. Never trust a man with a Windsor knot. You know who said that? You don't like super spies, why not? Detectives are better, like you. But we both solve crimes. Come on, he's a terribly spy. Why is he a terrible spy? He tells everyone who he is. Well, he tells them who he is, but not what he does. You wanna know what real detectives do? Spy on people, to get information. And that's it? That's the real world, kiddo. So what do spies do in the real world? If we knew that, they wouldn't be very good spies, would they? I'll worry about the real world once I'm grown up. Come on, finish your shake, we'll be late for the memorial. Weapon of choice. Ammo of choice. Slug, not buckshot. More stopping power. Less spread, less mess. Take a man's head clean off. Explain again why you're here? Lamya's mother asked me to help find her. I am Lamya's mother. Since she was 13. Strange. That harpy never gave a shit before. You're a private investigator? Yes, I am. My late husband, during the Senoi Praaq, fighting commies during the emergency. - Was he... - Senoi, sure. Not that it helped. They're the masters of lucid dreaming. Right. Whatever that means, something to do with controlling dreams to overcome nightmares? A child's fearful dream of falling is praised as a gift to learn to fly the next night. John Hassell. Are you of indigenous descent? Part of me is. Ah. Which tribe? The oldest. We never connected, me and her. She always had this look about her. You know, especially after her old man passed on. We never forced her to do anything, figured if she was doing something she loved, she would open up, but no. She just disappeared into her own private world. Even more. Did she have any friends at the university, men and the likes? Secretive was Lamya's middle name, Detective. So. We don't know what she got up to outside, girls will be girls. Maybe this will help, this is her poetry and prose book. It was her way out. Maybe it will show you which way she went. On the streets of Primrose Hill, autumn was almost at end to make way for the harsh realities of winter. Here, in my room, at my dorms, I can only imagine how beautiful those brown dying leaves must look as they float to the ground. Outside my window, the clouds mark the coming of the monsoon, of darker times. Could this be an omen, it's only my first year here in college, but it's nothing like how I imagined. There's no sense of community here, and I doubt there ever will, not at home, not here, not anywhere. I only have one refuge, my dreams. Look at me. What do you see? I see my dream. Am I real? Yes. Then I'm no dream. It sure feels like one. Yet you believe it's real. I believe what I see. How can you believe in someone that you don't know? I've always known you. And I, you. I know everything I need to know about her, but I still had no idea where she was. I only had one feasible lead. She's been missing for more than a year now. So are 1,000 other people, you're looking for them, as well? Her parents hired me to find her. And what have you found out, Mr. Detective man? You, her best friend, her only friend. We were classmates, I don't think we were pals. Did she date? No. She was a good girl. But that didn't stop guys from lusting after her. Like who? My dance professor. - He tried it on? - Definitely did. He even set up a special tutorial for her, anyway, she ditched his class as soon as he revealed his hand. About a week after, before she vanished, actually. - And do you think he... - Maybe. But 60 alibis said that the turd was in tutorial the whole day, police questioned him, cleared him. Cops ask the wrong questions. You know, you look kind of familiar. Have we met? If we did, it'll come back to me. No. It's about Lamya. Make it quick, I have a staff meeting to attend. At this hour? It is night school, you fool. I understand Lamya spoke to you in many occasions, do you think she ran away? And if so, what was she running from? What else? Reality. My dear man, I'm surprised she didn't do it sooner. The poor child, and if she found someone to share her delusion, then I wouldn't be surprised if she ran off with him. Unfortunately, it wasn't you. What? Or did you only want to? Did she turn you down, laugh in your face? What are you insinuating? Not me. This. My source informs me that she regularly handed you this book to evaluate her writing talents. Professor, Professor, Professor? Enough. She wanted out, didn't she, she wanted out from whatever shit stick you got her into, but you couldn't let that happen, so you killed her. It wasn't me, it was them. Oh, fuck. You don't understand. Nobody understands your stupid mind, stupid, stupid. Calm down. I thought I could join them, compose my own world, open the gateway with my own craft, but I wasn't worthy. I wasn't worthy. You don't get it, do you, they denied me, me! What did they deny you? Is it you, you pissant? What makes you more worthy than me? A learned man! A learned man, who's wasted in this fucking shit hole, and they wouldn't let me finish their story? I ask you again, is it you? Cloud walker, she was a cloud walker. The door to a kingdom, the door. It was there, it was there in her journal, - I tried to crack... - Crack what? The combination, combination to her kingdom. Kingdom, the fuck are you talking about? Unlock the sequence, and the doors open, the doorway to her dreams, dream teller, storyteller, but they stopped me. Who? The Hidden Ones, they guard the doors against trespassers. Trespassers like you. Fucker. Could I really die, could I re-dream it? How was I rewriting the game book? If you think the art teacher is a person of interest, go to page 26. I had to find Lamya. You know, you seem awfully familiar. How so? I can't quite place it, I can just smell it, you know? Sweet scent of virginity. I'm sorry? That's just it, the both of you are exactly alike, like two aliens who've landed here from some foreign planet, and you're just trying to find your space in this world, which is so, well, alien to you. Kind of like Superman, but without the babies. Do you believe in fate, Ms. Kahn? No, I believe in wants, desires, fantasies. Much like what Lamya did, and we all have the need to express ourselves. What do you desire most, Anton? Ms. Kahn, please. Fine. Did she date? We were roomies, not buddies, but there was definitely someone interested in her. Our art professor, he paid particular attention to her. Yeah, he was the kind of guy who would say, the younger the fiddle, the tighter its strings, if you know what I mean. He made a move? Yes, all the way to setting up a special tutorial just for her. Believe me, she ran like the wind the moment she found out. That was the week before she disappeared, actually. I'm sorry, that number is busy. Please leave a message after the tone. Dan, help me. The game book had changed everything somehow. As the story changed in my mind, it changed in reality. If this even is reality. Hey, are you nuts, meeting me here? I could blow my operation. You got it? Do you know what that fucking cost me? Oh, shit, no. What? No, no! This is not her. It's the only Lamya Shahruddin case there is. I'm not losing my mind, this is not her. What's going on? The body, the body was just there. And I had this tarot card in my hand, it's with me somewhere. Okay. The book, the book, it's in the office. I'll show you what happened. They're gonna kill me, they're gonna fucking kill me. I know it's a setup, but I have no choice. They have her. They have her. Who's they? The bastards that took me, I, I know it's them, I see their fucking faces every night - in my dreams. - Oh, okay, okay. Calm down, let's start from the top. How did this happen? This, this woman. She asked me to find her daughter. What do you mean, asked? You're not even licensed, you were just supposed to hold the fort, not fucking do my job. Anton, are you taking your medicine? Anton, go home. You don't believe me, do you? Come on, let's go. You think this is a fucking delusion? I know you're fucking delusional! Now, go the fuck home. Fuck it. Anton. I can't blow this case. You're off your meds. Tomorrow, tomorrow we'll go see the doctor, and take some, okay? Okay, we'll, we'll deal with this tomorrow. Mr. Keith, did you send someone to my office a few days ago? Who is this? The guy you ripped off because you could. Anton, how could I ever forget? Do you know a Louise Numan? Can't say that I do, what is this about? You're not her. Is Ms. Shahruddin here? Shahruddin, they moved, last year. What? Look, you go outside, I give you the address. Oi! I'm a detective. You've got to have experience, a track record, what do you have, huh? Imagination? Why did you become a cop? Because of you, my bro. Remember the first day that we ran into each other? It felt good to be a hero. I wanted to help other kids, too, and when I met your dad, it sealed the deal. How did you and Anton meet again after 30 years? He found me, and the kid has his dad's talents, even as his mind is falling apart. All his life, he couldn't remember what happened back then. Pieces came back to him in his dreams. He came back here looking for answers. Since his dad died, I was the only anchor left for him to the event. Then why did you quit? Reality. It's complicated, listen, politics, oh, you know what? I wanted to do my own thing. Same here. He was sinking deeper into his childhood persona. Okay, fine. I'm gonna take you on as my assistant. No, no, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop, not an assistant, intern. You help me out, follow my orders. If you don't fuck up. Are you fucking serious? Don't get too excited, this is just a dry run. If you fuck up, ch. Understand? Okay, okay, okay, okay, relax, relax, relax. The job gave him focus, maybe doing basic investigative work could lead him back to his real self. He was working. I thought he was. Dan, help me. My mind was unraveling. It felt like if I could just find Lamya, I might also find myself, understand what happened to me when I was a kid, unlock my memories, but I had nothing. Maybe one thing. Why is this happening to me? Isn't this what you wanted? Mystery, murder, lust? Everything you ever imagined, everything you ever needed to love. You thought it wasn't going to be a bumpy ride. Every protagonist needs to be antagonized. You're writing the story, Anton, we just pick up the pieces, put them into place. But if you're strong enough to see it through the way you want it to, you'll make it. No! Run! Run! Run, run! No, no! You, my pet. What do you want? To stop you! No kid should wield that much power. But we'll fix you, we'll fix you fine. Where is Lamya? Yes, of course, hook, line, and sinker, he took the bait, jail bait. You boys are so fucking predictable. But why? Why do you need her so much, when we have each other? So. Do you want to play? Or run away into your book, little boy? So you want to play? Or run away to your book, little boy? Kid never want to stop playing, huh? I should have killed you when I had the chance. I should have ripped you into a million pieces when I had the chance. Play time's over, boy. It took a while. But who's counting, when the one who got away is back in my loving arms. You see, boys will be boys. Ah, do you know how much damage you've done? How much I've got to set right? But we set her right, didn't we? Stay away from him, take me instead. You're not my type. She's mine, then. That bitch took it for you, you! So you could run! It's all your fault she's like this. But it's good. It's good we found each other. Now, I've got another use for you. Another use for you. You'll be needing this for what comes next. See, pretty little girls aren't the only bait. An old acquaintance owes me a pound of flesh, and I always collect my due. Khalid! Your turn to do the honors. You're supposed to be dead. Only in one version, kiddo. You see what kind of a shit storm you get into when you don't stick to your old man? You're the one who didn't stick around. But I paid a price for my sins, you were that price. Tonight, we fix everything. She paid a price, too. For me. Alone again, without even a person to share this silence with. I would have thought that would have been the way for the rest of my time in this world, another existence floating amongst the living, until fate brought me to my destiny. The more I saw him, the more I realized how similar we were, two people awake in a world full of dreamers. It's not use. He's already marked you. Who is he? A devourer of dreams. And who are you? The one who makes them. Then who am I? Isn't it obvious? You, you've come to take... Take you away from here. Shh, it's all right. Shh. It's all right, it's all right. But, what about? It's not a dream without him. If you go now, they will stop you. When will I see him again? He'll join you eventually. You'll come for him, too? When he's ready. There's something I have to do first. These pages are for you. One day, I hope you'll find them, and join me on a threshold to a new beginning. I will wait for you. This is it, isn't it? What? You, we have to slay the beast forever. But we won, right? Bastard! A lot can happen in one page, girl. Bleed for me, my pet. Bleed for me. Slay the beast. How long has he been missing? Almost a week. Don't blame yourself, the man wasn't stable. You think I don't know that? But I took him on, I had no right to send him away when he needed me. Too busy chasing influential socialites. You need help finding him? You offering? Cash. And perhaps a little intel. Do you believe in fate, Mr. Hamzi, and life coming full circle? Bring him home. Violet Horizons, by Joseph Tone. You know, if it wasn't for this guy, I'd be flipping burgers by now. This is not her! It's the only Lamya Shahruddin case there is. I'm not losing my mind, this is not her. Our eyes locked as we prepared to die. There was no turning back, no escape, only surrender. I could feel my lifeblood warming the cold, hard concrete. We may have been worlds apart, but as we lay there in the same place where it all began, all those years ago, we were meant to walk the clouds together. Barely conscious, I rested in her arms as she struggled to speak her last words. Slay the beast. It's okay. It doesn't hurt. Not anymore. Anton. What do you see?
