[♪ Pop song playing on radio] [Radio DJ] 'There you go with another super hit. 'Now we're gonna take five minutes off 'for the latest award-winning news 'from WFUN's Action Central. 'At the top of the hour, I'll be back with another great song 'from the Funderful 40 Survey here on the Dick Steyr Show. 'Don't go away. I'll be right back.' [Beeping] 'This is WFUN news director Larry Kane 'with another edition of WFUN award-winning news.' [Beeping] 'Many law enforcement agencies 'all over south Florida and the Miami area 'have been alerted to look for some fishermen 'who have mysteriously disappeared 'over the past five days. 'The two men fishing in the Gulf waters 'near Everglades National Park 'vanished from there earlier this week, 'and last night another man was reported missing 'after he failed to return from fishing near the swamp. 'This reporter has learned exclusively 'that the man's boat has been found, 'and the missing man's body has been recovered by authorities. 'More details as they become available. 'On the local political scene...' [Switches off radio] [Screams] Watch you step. Don't fall, Karen. Oh, that's all I need to begin my mid-term vacation. Relax. You have to in this climate. OK. Oh, thank you, Dr Hoyt. Please call me John. It's gonna be long two weeks. OK, John. Thanks. - Here we go. - Careful. One more. - Thank you. - And the last one. - Up you go. - Thank you. Phew! That sun is murder! - Let's get into the shade. - I'll get the suitcases. [Man] This island offers the seclusion I find necessary for my work. [Woman] It certainly is an island paradise. Why, thank you. There's some Orangeade in the refrigerator. Would you get it? Surely, Dad. Karen has told me that you're working in marine biology, Dr Richardson. That's right, Louise. Oh, here, girls, sit down. Make yourselves comfortable. John and I are working with sea life and evolution. That's why I'm located here on the island. The deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico are right over there, and about half a mile in that direction is the edge of the Florida Everglades. I don't know why you brought all this when a couple of bikinis would've been enough. [Chuckles] - Well, here are the drinks. - Ah, good. Dad, that's a nasty bump on your head. It's very strange, Karen. Someone stole some of the equipment out of the lab, and while I was looking for it, an amplifier fell out of one of the cabinets and hit me on the forehead. But John patched it up. - He's great, isn't he, Dad? - Who? Dr Hoyt. John. Oh... that's right. You haven't seen him before, have you? Talk about an absent-minded professor! John came to work for you after I went to school. Uh... yes. The university assigned him to help me with the next phase of research. He's a fine young man. I have a great deal of respect for him. I'll bet he's made Ruth's job a lot more interesting. Uh... I wonder where Ruth is. She was relaxing down on the dock when we left. I was sure she'd meet you. She's been looking forward to having you home. Well, she couldn't have gone far on this island. Maybe she's in her room. Oh, Egon might've taken her over to the mainland. Is Ruth the faithful, loyal Girl Friday I've heard so much about? Oh, she's more than that. She's the mainstay of the operation here. If it weren't for Ruth... Your bags are up in Karen's room, girls. Hey, where's Ruth? She'll miss all the fun. We were just wondering. What fun are you talking about? Well, we've invited some people to come over this afternoon. A kind of... impromptu welcome party for you and your friends. - A party? - With us looking like this? - My hair's a mess. - You have plenty of time. They won't be here for 15 to 20 minutes. - Boy, you're kidding. - He's on the level. Some biology students are coming over. Oh, Dad, you should've said something. We'll never be able to get ready on time. You'll never get ready sitting there talking. You're a great help. I thought you'd enjoy a surprise. Dr Hoyt, you don't know much about women. - [John] I'm willing to learn. - [Gasps] What's the matter? Oh, this is Egon. Egon, you shouldn't have sneaked up on her like that. You'll have to forgive Egon. He, uh... has a habit of appearing suddenly. Now, Egon, you've startled Miss Karen's guests. Hello. Hello, Miss Karen. Egon... have you missed me? Yes, Miss Karen. Nobody likes to go out on the reefs with me the way you do. Girls, Egon is one of the best swimmers I've ever seen. [Louise] Oh, you're cute. Would you be my date for the party? Louise, be kind. He's a friend of mine. Egon is a very good worker, Louise. I don't know what I'd do without him. Oh, I didn't mean any harm. He just... Let's just drop it, Louise. Uh... you girls had better be getting ready. Well, we'll set an Olympic record for getting dressed. - Casual? - Very casual. Be back in a flash. - What are you going to wear? - I don't know... What's she so upset about? Oh, she's just taking the prerogative of a woman. And remember, if she doesn't look her best, she can always blame you. Who can understand women? Oh, incidentally, Egon, that wasn't very nice of you to come up on us like that. You frightened those poor girls. I'm sorry, Mr John. But that girl had no right to make fun of me. She's just like all the others. She wasn't making fun of you. You scared her. It isn't my fault. I hear a boat... It must be the kids from the university. I've got to go, I can't let them see me. They'll just laugh. Look, no one's going to laugh, Egon. You can go if you want to, but... Oh, relax. Relax, Egon, it's only the Sheriff. Maybe he's found our stolen equipment. Howdy, Doc... John... Egon. That's it, bring her right over. What is it, business or pleasure, Bob? Business, Doc. Sorry to break in on you like this. Well, what is it? Have you heard about the missing fishermen? Well, I heard some people talking on shortwave last night, but I was running a test and couldn't get on with them. What happened? Well, we've got one of them here. But there are two others still missing. There was no storm, no radio call. They just vanished. [Doc] What can we do to help? Can you come down into the boat? Doc, Doug's dead and we don't know what killed him. We found him out at the edge of the swamp, and he was a good half-mile away from his boat. What, uh... what did the Medical Examiner say? Well, I haven't taken the body to the M.E. yet. I don't like to second-guess, but I've seen enough stiffs to... Well, look, what can we do to help? I'm not a pathologist. Biology's my line. - What do you want from me? - Here, Doc, take a look. Phew... Well, I can tell this man died in agony. It's those welts... - John? - I see, Doctor. It looks like a Portuguese man o' war, but that's impossible. Egon, can you see these marks? You know what they are, Doctor. And I know, too. [Sheriff] What's he talking about, Doc? As John said, they look like man o' war. We work with them every day. But a Portuguese man o' war's sting is a small thing. That's what we don't understand, Bob. It's too big. Much too big to be the sting of a small tentacle. I tried to tell you it is possible, Doctor, for them to get that big. - Now, Egon... - What's he talking about, Doc? I never can understand him. Oh, it's nothing, Bob. Egon fancies himself quite a biologist. For a long time now, he's been trying to convince us that it's possible to cultivate a giant man o' war. - Well, is it possible? - It is. I know it. Nobody would listen to me, but I know it is. No, it isn't, Bob. Not by any method we know. They never get bigger than eight inches across. We've tried to raise them in captivity, but they begin to die within an hour or so. Egon thinks you can breed them like cattle. You know Egon. So, what killed this man? As I said, they look like Physalia wounds, but they're too big, it'd be impossible. - Phys-what? - Oh, Physalia. That's a technical name for a man o' war. It is possible, Doctor. Well, I'll the M.E. about your ideas, Doc. Any more suggestions? Uh, why not have the pathologist run a chemical breakdown on the tissues around the wounds? If we could get a report on that, it would help us tell what caused this fella's death. Yeah, that's a good idea. Well, I guess we better get back to the mainland. - Uh, incidentally, Bob... - Yeah? I think Ruth must've gone into town. If you see her, will you have her give me a call on the radio? Glad to, Doc. See you later. - Bye, John. - Bye. OK, Charlie, let's go. Horrible. That man died a violent death. I can't understand it. You could understand it, Doctor, if you just listen to me. We have listened to you. Now let's not go into all that. - But I've tried... - Egon! We've been over it a hundred times! It's physiologically impossible for a man o' war... John, let's not get into another one of those arguments. There's too much to do. I've got to go out on the reef. Fine. Egon, help me with the party. Wow, this is as bad as Rush Week. It's always Rush Week on this island. Some vacation! Tomorrow we'll relax. We can swim on the reef. [♪ Music playing outside] - Are they pretty? - You can't imagine. - Karen, could it be the party? - That'll be John. - Who needs this aggravation? - I'll check. John, who was that? Don't worry about it. Your father just had to talk to the Sheriff. The police? Why? Nothing important. Are the girls ready yet? Well, they're nearly all dressed. You know, that really was unfair. You could've given us more warning. You don't need any improving. You're, uh... perfect as you are. - Well, that's very flattering. - [Clattering] Uh, your father has to go out on the reef today. I'll be back in a little while. Oh, Dad, you can't work today. It's my first day home. Oh, Karen, this party isn't for me. I've got to go out on the reef and check the hatchery. We're gonna be needing some new specimens in the next couple of days. Are you sure you don't need Egon and me to help? No, you stay here and make the party a success. That wild bunch from the university will guarantee it. Karen knows some of them. I'll leave the party to you young people. - I've got to get going. - Are you sure you won't stay? Karen, these new dance moves are not for me. Your mother and I used to shine doing the Big Apple, the Twist and the Ska. Uh-huh, not for us senior citizens. Please, Dad. I'm sorry, Karen, I have work to do. I won't be gone too long. Has dad been working too hard? He looks very tired. It's... just a setback we've had in one of the experiments. I won't bore you with the details. Oh, but I'm never bored with dad's work. Don't you worry about him, he'll be alright as soon as we get back to work on the experiment. - Oh, I forgot the ice. - Well, can I help? No, no, I'll be back in just a minute. [♪ Pop music playing] [Gasps] [Sighs heavily] You're too much! I mean, the way you move around is enough to scare a person to death! I... I'd never hurt you, Miss Karen. You're the only person that's been nice to me. Come on, I know you don't mean any harm, it's just that... ...you scare people when you sneak up on them like that. Do I... scare you, Miss Karen? Are you still doing the experiments out at the swamp? Oh, yes. I'm working on a very important one now. Would you like to come out and see it? Your dad is going to be so proud of me. He might even get rid of that John and make me his assistant. - Don't you like John? - Uh... It's not just him, it's most people. They just don't... they don't seem to like me. Oh, John's not like that. He's... Incidentally, have you seen Ruth out at the lab? [Woman] Karen! Karen, where are you? Over here! No, no... No, I haven't seen Ruth. Your friends are coming. They'll laugh... Oh, no, don't be silly, Egon. They're not gonna laugh, I won't let them. You know, Karen, this place is fantastic. Who'd ever expect to find a home with all these comforts right in the middle of the Everglades? Well, this island's been family property for years. I can remember... - What's that? - What? Over there, across the canal. All I can see is my uncle's house. I thought I saw something moving in the shrubs. Well, it might be Egon. He moves fast. My uncle only comes down in the winter. No one lives there year-round. Oh, boy! My hands are freezing! There must be a better way to carry ice. - Yeah, in a Highball. - Cool. Hey, John, who's coming to this shindig? Young people from the university. - Frat rats? - No, not the fraternity groups. Mostly seniors and grad students. Good group, though. They really like to cut loose! Crazy. Speak of the devil, here they come. Let's show them our hospitality. Alright.

I'm eating. - Yeah, later, after we eat. Then we can all get cramps and drown! Well, I'm going in. You can put on a suit in the cabana. Well, who needs a suit? Just like this.

Come on over and get something to eat. Not on your life. This is fun! Oh, let her be, Karen. I guess she'll survive. Yeah, let's let her enjoy the party. You know, I'll enjoy the party more if I get into some dry clothes. [Raucous laughter] [Laughter] [Screams] [Screaming] Let the doc through. Karen, get my medical kit. It's in the cabana. John, go call the Sheriff on the shortwave. Hurry, Karen. Take it easy Ben. Is he gonna be alright, Doc? Take it easy now. Just relax, Ben. The doc's here, it'll be alright. [Coughing and spluttering] That'll help hold down the infection, Ben, but we gotta get you to a hospital. Louise doesn't look too bad. I don't know what it is yet. But this man really needs medical attention. Can I talk to you? - The radio, it's been smashed. - Smashed? Yeah, and it was no accident. It's really broken up badly. - Hank? - Yes, Doc? Get the kids in the boat and get them over to the mainland. Don't mention this, but I want you to contact the Sheriff. Get him over here as soon as possible. Don't you want Karen and the other girls to come with us? No, they'll be safe here. We have guns. We mustn't get too far from that research project. Just keep moving. And contact the Sheriff as soon as you get Ben to the hospital. Right, Doc. Come on, give me a hand. You're alright, Ben, we're gonna take care of you now. Listen, everybody. Doc says we have to get Ben to the hospital. So I want everyone in the boat right away now. Come on! Easy, Ben, You're alright. Come on. [Woman] Oh, God! He's hurt bad. Easy with him. Easy, Ben, you're alright. Oh, Ben. He's hurt bad. Just take it easy, Ben. [Man] The engine! It's stopping! Look... jellyfish! [Man] There's more of them! Jellyfish! They're all over! They're attacking! Water's pouring in the bottom! The boat's sinking! [Shouting and screaming] [Screaming] [Screaming] [Groans] She'll calm down now, girls. She's more frightened than anything else. Talk to her as she gets quiet, it'll help her. John... Here... I've got one in my room. You keep this one. Better make sure nothing happens. I hope the kids send the Sheriff over as soon as possible. Without that radio, we're really isolated. I'm gonna go try to get it fixed right now. I'm sorry, Doctor, I can't eat. I don't think any of us are in the mood for eating. Dad, who could've destroyed the radio? All a mystery to me, Karen. And what about Ruth? The Sheriff should be here in the morning. He'll have some answers. I thought he'd be here tonight, but... Dad, could Ruth have...? Tomorrow. In the morning I'm going out and bring Egon here. He should be here tonight. It would be safer. No, I know Egon. He won't come in on his own. We'll take the aqualungs, too. I wanna stop on the way back and check on the breeding traps. May I go with you? Karen's told me how beautiful the reefs are. - You dive, Jessica? - Yes, sir. Well, we'll only be under 15-20 minutes. Not much time for sightseeing. - I won't be any bother. - OK, be ready to go at dawn. - I'd like to go, too. - Of course. It's been a horrible day. You girls had better turn in and get ready for the morning. I'll make sure all the doors and windows are locked. Good. I'll go now and work on the radio. Well, I guess I'll go and check on Louise. - I really hope she's alright. - She'll be alright. It's raining. It fits our mood. Oh, John, what's happening? I don't know. Is it possible...? Is it possible to fall in love with all that's happened? Very possible. I know because... I have. Egon? Egon, can you hear me? Could he be over there? That's all swamp and quicksand. Come on. Amazing! All of this out in the middle of the Everglades. A scientist must work someplace. This lab offers deep Gulf waters a few minutes from here, and swampy pools right outside the door. - This is where Egon lives. - What a creepy place to live! Well, he likes it well enough. What are those things in the tanks? [Doc] That is a fine collection of Physalia. Portuguese man o' war, silly. Some people call them jellyfish. Never seen them before. They blow up on the beaches sometimes. Sting like mad if you touch them. Those tentacles contain a poison that's nearly identical to the deadly venom of a cobra. You mean, that little thing could kill a human? Theoretically, yes. If properly administered, the venom in one Portuguese man o' war could shock the average person's system enough to kill. Egon? Are you here, Egon? You girls relax. I'll be a couple of minutes. I left my cigarettes in the boat. Be right back. [Screams] What was that? [Screaming] [Screams] [Screams] I'm through, girls. Egon must've gone out on the reef. Let's go back. - What was that? - What was what? - It sounded like a scream. - Wh-where's Donna? Oh, my God! Donna! Donna, where are you? Donna? Donna? Come on, let's get the airboat. We'll use it to check the lake area. Look, bubbles! We'll have to dive here. She must be right below us. Jessica, stay close. We've got to find her. - I'm out of air, Doc. - What do we do? - Uh... I'll free-dive. - Alright, I'll wait, then. I'm beginning to get worried about everyone. They should've been back by now. Maybe they had trouble with the boat. Possibly. I'm gonna check in on Louise. And I wanna get cleaned up, too. - I'll be right back. - Alright. I'll stay here. Louise? Louise? [Screams] [Screaming] [Gasps] Oh! Donna and Jessica are... ...are lost. Gone. - Not a trace of them. - Oh, Dad! Right now, we're going to get Susan and Louise and take them to the mainland. It's not safe on the island, Karen. Not safe for anyone. The police will have to send someone out to investigate. Come on, we've got to get going. Karen, go tell Susan to hurry. We'll get Louise. [Louise groans] [Screaming] What's the matter? Karen, what is it? - I'll see what's wrong. - Karen! - Karen? - It's Susan. She's... [Screams] Try to catch her, she's hysterical! No! No! Oh... Karen, Karen, are you alright? Egon, where have you been? We went out to the lab, you weren't there. Two of the girls are missing. One has been killed. - Egon, have you seen Ruth? - No, Doctor. Who scared Miss Karen? Is somebody trying to hurt Miss Karen? Egon, there's a maniac loose around here. We've gotta go to the mainland for help and get Karen and Louise to safety. - We've got to go now. - We can't go, Mr John. - What do you mean, Egon? - Look at the boat. - When did that happen? - I don't know. Oh... we'll have to use the airboat. How? We can't use ours, we're out of gas. Gene forgot to bring the new supply. Can't use mine either. I've less than a gallon left, so we can't use mine. I... I almost finished fixing the radio last night. I'll get that working and we'll call for help. I don't know why the Sheriff isn't here... You know those people, Mr John? You can't trust them, they're no good. Dr Richardson, you know that. Here, Egon, take this and keep Karen in the living room. The Doctor and I will try to fix the radio. Why do I need this? Just use it to protect Miss Karen. We'll be in the radio room. - No, leave the door open, John. - Alright. All this is awful, Egon. What on earth can be happening? Horrible, horrible things are reeling through my mind. It's... It's like a nightmare. Just... just try to relax, Miss Karen. Just... just relax for a minute. [Sighs heavily] I... I have to go out and talk to your dad. Oh, no, no. Please take me with you. I don't wanna be here. Just stay here, Miss Karen. Remember, your father told you to listen to me? Just stay here, Miss Karen. Alright, let's check it again. Uh, must be the wiring. Oh! You know, there really is something to the complaints about your sneaking up, your... constantly scaring people. You don't mean that, Miss Karen. You like me, don't you? Oh... of course I like you, Egon. It's... One thing has nothing to do with the other, but that's not important. How are they doing with the radio? They'll be through soon. You like me, don't you, Miss Karen? Yes, Egon, but just stay away. Then... then you won't be angry with me, will you? Well, I like you, silly. Why should I be angry? I had to do it, Miss Karen. For us. They were no good. Egon, why are you acting this way? Now just stay away. I had to do it, Miss Karen. They were no good! Egon, what are you saying? What in God's name do you mean? They were no good, Miss Karen, for you. They were just using you. John's trying to take you... You see... I love you, Karen. Only you. - They don't love you. - Egon... Susan upstairs... You! That should do it, Doc. John, the door's closed. Who do suppose...? I'm gonna check on Karen. [Engine noise over dialogue] [Engine splutters] [Coughing] [Gasping] You're just the same as the others. You don't like me either! No, Egon. I like you! Please don't do this. We all like you. You don't understand. No, you don't like me, you think I'm ugly! That's not true, Egon! [Muffled screams] You see? You don't like me! - No! - Nobody likes me! Nobody! [Crying] Nobody. Nobody. Except... Except... I... I told your father I could do it. But he wouldn't believe me. They all said I was crazy. But I did it. Do you hear me, Karen? I did it! I stole... I stole the instruments from your father. Then I fed the electricity down here from my house on the island. Look at them. Look at them, Karen! Better than 20 inches across, living in captivity. [Laughs] All the bright marine biologists said they couldn't be grown. But I found the answer. Sea water... electricity... ...and human blood. Mixed with a chemical that I stole from your father's lab. That's how I did it. Look... look at them. Look at my creation! That's not all I can do. No... I can do other things, too. [Electrical buzzing] You don't want me. But he does! Yeah. Go ahead, look, Karen! Look at what your father laughed at! What John called a stupid theory! [Gasps] [Screaming] [Crying and wailing] Come on, Karen. There's not a moment to waste. Oh, my God. Egon, what's happening to you? There's nothing more we can do for him. This place will explode any minute! [Karen] You've got to come with me, Egon. I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen. - You've got to come with us. - We've got to go now. No, we can't leave him, not like this. Get her out of here. This whole place is wired. Everything's going wrong. John, please... get her out of here. I'll take her up and then I'll come back for you. Don't worry about me. It's too late. Come on, Karen, move. No, I won't leave him here. Not like this. We have to. I'll come back for him later. Come on! - Karen... - No! - John, is she alright? - I think so. [Rumbling] Oh, Daddy! - Oh, it was... so horrible. - Don't try to talk. Oh, please, Daddy, how could something like that ever happen? Just close your eyes. Don't think about it. I don't know, Karen. I don't know. Maybe someday... someone will find an answer.
