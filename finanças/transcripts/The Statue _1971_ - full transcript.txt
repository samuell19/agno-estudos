(dramatic music) (loud rumbling) (repeated chiming) (upbeat music) - And here at the United Nations building in New York a special session of the subcommittee on education. Delegates from all the nations of the world gathered together to watch Unispeak in action. Young people of different races and nationalities no longer divided by the artificial barrier of language. For the first time speaking together with one tongue. (speaking in foreign language) (loud applause) - Perhaps I should translate. - Alex Bolt. The hitherto unknown English professor whose years of research gave birth to Unispeak. This entirely new language. - We bring you a message in Unispeak from all the young people of the world. Now that we have got rid of our differences in language we find that all our other differences are also on the way out. We hope that Unispeak will do the same for you as soon as possible. Thank you. - While the formal acknowledgements are being made over by communication satellite to the United States embassy in London and an interview recorded earlier today with Unispeak's most devoted advocate the United States Ambassador to the Court of St James. His Excellency Raymond L Whitely. - Thank you. Unispeak has to be the most exciting communications breakthrough of our time and I am proud to have played a major part in separating the UN from some of its monies to set up the Unispeak Foundation. Here in London, just off Grosvenor Square, young people from all over the world are coming for the special 10 week course of instruction. - Within five years Greek will be conversing with Spaniard, Turk with Congolese, Japanese with Russian. Even perhaps American with English. - What kind of man is he? This modest assistant professor of linguistic anthropology? We spoke with his wife. - Rhonda Bolt. Internationally acclaimed sculptress. How do her husband's world and her world connect? - About two days every six months. That's how it's been since he started with Unispeak. - But there is a connecting point. This massive sculpture was especially commissioned from Rhonda Bolt to stand in Grosvenor Square. To commemorate the setting up of the Unispeak Foundation. It is, I suppose, a symbolic representation of the whole Unispeak concept? - That's a good suppose. - Which, if I may now unveil, for-- - Uh uh uh. Bad suppose. No one sees that until it's up in Grosvenor Square. And the first camera peaks under there I cut off the lens. - There's been a surprise interruption here. I'm sorry to cut short that recorded interview but, just a moment. - The Swedish delegation has just received the following cable. For his exceptional contribution towards helping nation speak peace unto nation, Professor Alexander Bolt awarded special Nobel prize. (loud applause) - Oh my God, the Nobel prize. Oh it's like a dream, he's never won anything before. Even in a raffle. - No man was ever a more worthy recipient. No man has ever done more to deserve it. Why do I always look like I need to shave? Well. It didn't hurt Nixon any. Ultimately. Rhonda come on let me have one little look. - [Rhonda] No, this is thank you for Alex. - Oh wait now my state department paid for it. $50,000. - Still cheaper than a war. - Ah! - At the official unveiling, that's when you'll see it. - Well suppose I make a guess and you can say whether I'm warm or cold. - No, Yankee go home. (sweeping music) (knocking at door) Who is it? - [Woman] It's Dunhill madam. - Just a minute. - Oh you've unwrapped it. Why it's Mr Alex. Oh! (upbeat music) - Mr Bolt. Is it true that you gave the President Unispeak lessons? - Well I taught him one or two useful phrases. - [Man] Such as? (speaking in foreign language) - [Man] Meaning? - Meaning no comment. - Is there anything you don't do for him? - He brushes his own teeth. - Maybe I should write a story around you. How it feels to be a Nobel Prize winner's faithful assistant. - There are worse trades. - How long have you been faithfully assisting? - 11 years. - Through thick and thin and rough and smooth. - Man and beast. Now, from now to the unveiling ceremony that's all your appointments canceled. (Alex groans) And it's the words of gratitude that makes the whole thing so worthwhile. - [Man] Have you got a publisher yet Mr Bolt? (people shouting over each other) - [Man] Mr Bolt can you tell us anything about your wife's new sculpture? - Oh all I know about modern art is if you can hang it on the wall it's a painting. If you can walk around it it's a sculpture. Hey just a minute do you plan to follow me all the way to my bedroom? - When we do a story we do it in depth. - What's Time Magazine got that the others haven't? - A cover. (speaking in foreign language) - And still can't make up her mind what to wear. You see Rhonda's been up since six this morning getting herself ready. - [Reporter] I've been trying to figure out where he's from. - Joachim, oh he's one of our star pupils. Came to us from Central Paraguay, from the jungle. Learned Unispeak in six weeks. When he first arrived he could hardly grunt.

I thought you might like to pop in to say hello. Ambassador Whitely is Unispeak's number one booster. A most passionate champion. - Yes you're quite right but not now. I want to get home to Rhonda. Joachim. Car's a tally-ho. ♪ He looks like a statue ♪ When he's looking at you ♪ You're out of your mind - It's happening Chuck.

The young vote. - Could carry man, clear through to the White House. - If called, I will serve. - I heard from that Southwick lady. Green light. - All right, fix it for me at that Anglo-American friendship luncheon. - At the Hilton? - Book a room, thank you. In your name. - Again? I'm getting known as the village stud. - Better you than me. - If called he will serve. (whistles Hail to the Chief) - [Alex] I'm going to have a nice long rest. - [Woman] You do that. (speaking in foreign language) Have fun. - Ah Dunhill, how nice to see you again. - Huh. Hmm. - Must be having the change. (romantic music) Darling I'm home. Put on the black one. (speaking in foreign language) - I hope that means let's go to bed. - That's exactly what it means. - [Rhonda] First the statue. - [Alex] What statue? - What statue? - Oh the statue! Oh I can't wait to see it. - And then we go to bed. Violently. - [Alex] In depth. - [Rhonda] Come on darling. - Oh, oh yes. Oh yes. Oh that says community, that says understanding. - That says an eagle. - Oh that says eagle-- - Oh I'm glad because that says a statue. - It's me! Oh my God! - [Rhonda] It is my tribute to you. - Tribute? - You don't like it. - Well it's nothing to do with that it's just that. Oh. But you were asked to design something to symbolize Unispeak, a new language, not. Not middle-aged Peter Pan looking for the soap. - But darling Unispeak is you. - In the nude? - Oh that's it. That's the real objection. - And why not! For months, for years, I've been trying to persuade the world that Unispeak is not just another short-cut to pot and sex. And now Unispeak's founder exhibiting himself all over Grosvenor Square. Flashing it at the tourist buses. - The male body has been a subject for sculpture ever since, since always. - All right then use the body but put somebody else's head on it. Don't you see-- - I see. You are a pissy English man. - The word is prissy. - Words are your business, mine is marble. - Rhonda. Look, darling. I don't want to hurt you, I admire you. And although it's now certain that I shall be sleeping in the guest room. - Mm hmm. - Mm hmm. I love you but I will not, I repeat not allow that thing to go on public exhibition in Grosvenor Square. - You've got nothing to not allow. The statue is the property of the American government. Grosvenor Square is the property of the, whoever owns Grosvenor Square. - Rhonda! As your husband for 10 years now please. - As an artist for 15 years, no. - Dammit the thing's gonna make you into a laughing stock. Look at it, look at it objectively. A socking great nude statue of your own husband. How corny can you get? - My sculpture is corny? - As Kansas in August. (shouting in foreign language) An injunction. That's what I want today. Any legal mumbo jumbo that will prevent them from putting that statue on display. - [Man] Out of the question. - Out of the question? - We should have to prove that the statue is in a way defamatory. In other words, that it exposes you to dishonor or contempt. Well. With a work by Rhonda Bolt. - More likely to evoke admiration than disparagement. - But Sir Geoffrey she's got me there naked. - The statue, dear boy. - A world of difference. - In court. - Making it stand up. - If a sculptress of Rhonda's standing, internationally respected and of unquestionable integrity. If such an artist chooses to represent her theme in terms of the naked human form. - It's not the human naked form it's my human naked form. Look. What would happen if I went into Grosvenor Square and stood there with no clothes on. - [Man] You'd be run out dear boy. - Pretty smartish. Indecency. - Yet a copy of me 30 feet high with everything twice the size can stand up there floodlit. You call that logic? - We're not dealing with logic dear boy. Just the law. One can only suggest that it might have been advisable not to have posed for the work in the first place. - But I didn't pose for it. Bloody idiot lawyers. Harry you and I worked so closely on the communications theory build up for Unispeak, now help me with this. I've got to talk to someone. - Not me Alex, please. You know the one thing I can't stand is getting involved with people's emotional problems. - But you're a psychiatrist. - Don't throw that in my face! - [Alex] You've got an honors degree in psychiatry, you studied psychiatry at the Tavistock clinic. - Only to get into advertising. Consumer psychology. Sales motivation. Nothing thank God to do with people. The only time anyone ever lies on that couch is when I stretch out alongside her so please Alex no consultation situations. I get uncomfortable. - [Alex] All right then, as my friend. Who else can I turn to? What's a man's best friend for? - Traditionally to make his wife. All right. You don't fancy your fair white body being put on public display. Why not? - Because the idea revolts me. Am I being irrational? Does that show some personality defect of ego fashion? - Don't start that psychiatry jargon. You don't like the idea because you don't like the idea. That's reasonable. So tell Rhonda if she goes ahead you'll clobber her. - Clobber her physically? - No with a ray-gun. - Harry. My objection has to be in terms of the work itself. Rhonda is a professional woman. - Every woman is a professional woman. All right. Outflank her. Go to whoever commissioned the statue. - Well the US State Department. Thank you, that's Ray Whitely, just a moment. - [Harry] Isn't Whitely the ambassador? - Yes. - [Harry] What sort of a fellow is he? - I think he's an idiot but I may be overestimating him. Yeah that's right. I'm supposed to meet him this evening on some television show about Unispeak. Oh hell, look Pat's canceled it. - Well un-cancel it. Go along there, take him to one side and talk him out of the whole sculpture idea. - Harry you're a true healer of minds. - Uh uh, I'm an advertising man. And remember if there's anything further I can do to help. Please hesitate to ask. - [Man] Stand by studio, 50 seconds. Camera two in a bit closer. Nice head and shoulders please. - Eh eh, excuse me, excuse me. I'd like to have a word with the ambassador before we start. Where is he? - [Man] Chicago. - Chicago? - Hey. - Mm. - TV's still on. - Mm? - It's watching us. - As long as it's not the queen. - Good evening. With me today is the man-- - Oh this is some program Alex is supposed to be on. Well turn up the sound. - Let me make myself perfectly clear about that. Perhaps my friend Alex Bolt is best equipped to answer that question. - Let's bring him in then. Hello, live by satellite from London. Professor Alex Bolt. Welcome to Impact. - [Ray] Hello Alex, glad you could make it. - [Interviewer] Do you see no disadvantage to Ambassador Whitely's Unispeak project? - Oh yes I've seen one big disadvantage. That sculpture you commissioned. - What sculpture? - Well we're really not here to talk about that. Anyway I hardly think sculpture is in your area. - Well this one is, it's nothing but my area. Now Ray you take my advice. - We will take your advice in just a moment. But first, some good advice to Mrs Housewife. - Mrs who? - It's a commercial break. We're off the air. Hey that livened up pretty good didn't it. We gotta get back on that sculpture bit, huh. - Forget about the sculpture crap. What the hell you trying to do Alex, make me out to be a schmuck. - Now you listen to me Ray I know what I'm talking about. - Well you quit talking about yourself for a moment. We're dealing with something important, me. I was the one that persuaded the State Department to commission that thing for Rhonda. Now if you start knocking it on network television who gets hurt, not you. - Well that's just what-- - It's not your problem buddy boy, now will you just butt out and make your big-- - Back on the air. - Gee Alex, it's good to talk with you again. Now this is a man that I'm proud to call a friend. - Why don't you cancel the damn thing Ray. Spend your $50,000 on something more worthwhile. Think of all those Unispeak schools we could endow with that. - What's it a sculpture of? - Well it. Does it matter? - The point is, why blow $50,000 on some corny bit of carving when there are millions of people in want. - Corny bit of carving? (phone ringing) Well I hope Mrs Bolt wasn't watching. Yes? She was watching. Hello Mrs Bolt. No, no I wasn't watching. Turn it down. Yes. Oh really. Oh that doesn't sound like Mr Bolt. Come round? Ah. It's a little bit awkward at the moment you see I'm just in the middle of a press conference. Yes what about tomorrow morning then. Fine. I think we'd better make it the afternoon. - Now is that corny? - No. - Oh thank you. - It's awfully good. - Thank you. And a dry martini. (rhythmic music) - Here you are. Doubles. Oh. - I've good reason. - Which I've just come from a private view of. Could I have a dry martini? Now that is service. Well. Now here's looking at, looking at you. - All those people who eat their sandwiches in Grosvenor Square. Can't you just see them all clustering around for a stare-in. I'm well known now Pat. Television, magazines and. My face up there, they're bound to recognize it. And then. Oh God! - And you know what the fascinating thing is. It's not even yours. - What did you say? (upbeat music) It's not mine, so whose is it? - Don't shout at me. Calm! - Calm. I'm calm all right. I'm unnaturally calm. A tribute, that's what you called it. This is my tribute to you. All right, let's just check out that tribute shall we. Up there that's fine. That's good old Alex. And this is good old Alex. Even that is good old Alex. Good old Alex. Good old Alex. Good old Alex. And suddenly hello Charlie. - Charlie? - Charlie. George. Peter. Hopkins. Fosguy, I don't know. But not me. All right let's um, let's talk this over reasonably. - No no. That way you always win. Words! This is what I say to it. And what that says is in the last three years how much have I seen you. 18 days. This is my way of saying 18 days is not enough. A little private reproach that's all. - Private! That thing will tower over a whole city square. - Who will know? - He will. Charlie. Up there in marble on my body. - It didn't worry you to have another man's head on your body. Man! Anything that has to do with um, they become little boys. - That's no little boy. All right. So you had an affair with him. That's bad enough. But to go and immortalize the son of a bitch as guest star! - I've been trying to tell you something important for us. But you haven't even, you didn't even try to listen. All you're thinking about is, oh you are a pissy English man. No no no. I don't mean prissy. - So your wife had an affair with a statue. - [Alex] Sir Geoffrey I've already explained all this to you twice. - Geffers, I woke up and you were, oh hello young fella. Oh when are you going to let us see that sexy statue? - Humphrey. Do you remember de Nora versus Quill Productions? - Film star girl. Lisa de Nora. Horrible fleshy thing. They stuck another girl's bosoms on her in a swimsuit advertisement. - She not only stopped it but collected damages as well. - Well that's fine, this is exactly the same thing. - She stuck bosoms on you? Well that's very nasty. - Of course one still needs to prove that the difference is not simply a matter of artistic license. In other words, that it does depict a third-party. - Oh it does, it does all right. - Of course he may simply be a professional male model. - Oh, I have several good friends in that field. - [Alex] My wife doesn't use professional models. That's why I have to find out who Charlie is. - Exactly. When is the statue to be unveiled? - 10 days time, but don't worry I'll have it nailed by then. - Charlie? It all sounds most awfully complicated. - Don't bother your pretty head about it.

It's gonna help me find, no I'm on a diet. When I do. Whoever this fits. - You sound like a stag version of Cinderella. - I'm gonna maim him, I'm gonna grind my heels into his eyeball and I'm gonna exterminate him. - And this is a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. Relax. Ever seen the Leonardo painting of The Last Supper? Do you know who posed for that? Simple tradesmen. Butchers, grocers. - This is not a tradesman. - Oh there's a class-conscious remark. You may be able to recognize a gentleman by his accent but you certainly can't - Look look look - recognize a-- - look at the way it's been sculpted. Care. The meticulousness. Now look, look. There's affection there. Devotion. A tribute, that's what she called it, oh no. Oh no. It had to be somebody she was friendly with. Someone she saw a lot of. I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna make that housekeeper of mine give me a list of all the people who visited my house regularly while I was away. It might mean I have to track down four or five different men but I've got plenty of time. It's a good 10 days before that statue is officially unveiled. - Hey. If this is for me, at least autograph it. - I feel I'm being disloyal to madam. - Well at these prices just think of it as being loyal to sir. You're quite sure you put down all the gentlemen who visited my wife while I was away. - Yes. Everyone of them. Will that be all sir? - It's all I have on me. (signing in foreign language) There's one the old bag forgot to list. (speaking in foreign language) - Oh what are you doing, let him alone! (loud shouting) (loud crashing) - I was only trying to ask him a simple question. - I know what you ask him. I should've let him choke you. - I'll nail you Charlie. (gentle music) - [Harry] Okay let's try it. - [Man] I don't know Harry, I don't think they'll pass a nude commercial. - The quintessential associations of taking a bath are purity and sensuousness, it's very ambivalent. Or loaded. - But all the client wanted to push was sixpence off. Okay, let's go for a shot. - Harry! Harry, oh Harry! - Alex we're working here! All right take a break for five minutes. What is this, some kind of subscription list? - Well you could call it that. These are the people who have been seeing Rhonda. And Harry there were 30 names on that list, 30. Any one of them could be Charlie. - Well you won't get round that crowd in 10 days, they're all different parts of the country. - They're all over the world but that doesn't matter Harry. Somewhere in London, there's Ray Whiteley, there's her stockbroker, her lawyer, her doctor. - Oh come on. You can't go up to men like that and say would you mind taking your clothes off I want to see how you check out against this photograph I'm holding. - Well it is another aspect of the problem but it's not impossible. - You realize you've got to get close enough to peer. - Damn! I've dropped my bookmark.

Who told you that story about Alex? - [Woman] That boring old Harold Brodie. - And he saw them bounce Alex from the Turkish bath? - [Woman] He was with him. - Hmm. Alex Bolt. Steam room cowboy. - Thrown out. And everyone in that Turkish bath nudging each other. Except for one fellow who winked at me. Are you listening? - I'm listening yeah. Show me the armchair shot. No no no, bring out the latent masculinity in that chair. Understand. Give me virile. Show me. Stop down your diaphragm. - I don't know if I can go on with this search. I don't even know if I want to Harry. - That's better, now light it for thrust. Now you're talking. - I've been talking for 40 minutes, you haven't been listening. - Yes I have, let me ask you something. When you find Charlie, you're gonna mutilate him, right. - That had been my intention. - Why? - Well I was-- - Rough male look, know what I mean. Rugged, almost locker room. Is it passionate jealousy because he went to bed with Rhonda? Is it little boy peak because teacher's showing his toy to the class instead of yours. How much Othello and how much Charlie Brown? - Well it could be a bit of each. - Relax. - I'm trying to! - The male capacity for protecting the masculinity is almost infinite but so is the female towards her femininity. And Rhonda did have good cause for substituting you. 18 days in three years. - Well maybe she was a little sore but-- - No not sore but, sore and. Women don't get angry they get even. - You think I ought to forget it and go back? - What do you think? You're turning me back into a bloody psychiatrist, get up! Yes go back, tear up that bloody list and go back. - [Alex] Well thank you. Thank you Harry. - That was my first and my last analysis. Don't ever come to see me again unless it's a sales problem. You're standing there, have you photographed it already? (romantic music) - Shall we go-- - To bed? Should be sackcloth and ashes but they didn't have my size. Oh darling I've been such a buffoon. Do you want to give me a swift kick? Fast belt around the ear. - I want to take up this offer. (giggling) What's taking you so long? - You know. You were 100% right. Alex Bolt. Civilized, rational, reasonable. Your man of the 70s blueprint. Then along comes one little tiny ego challenge and I'm a Sicilian. Othello. A little boy. Isn't it strange the human capacity for making an absolute. - [Rhonda] Alex you're talking again. (romantic music) - [Alex] Oh I've been wanting to do this for a long time. - [Rhonda] Then do it for a long time. Alex. About the statue. What you wanted me to tell you. - [Alex] Doesn't matter anymore love. - [Rhonda] But you were so anxious to-- - [Alex] Just you. That's all I'm anxious for. That nice. - [Rhonda] That's gorgeous. Alex. You just move a little to there. Oh darling. Yes. Oh. Yes. Yes? No? - [Alex] No. - [Rhonda] You must be tired. - [Alex] From what, I've been lying on a slab all day. - [Rhonda] Oh don't worry darling. It can happen to anybody. Alex. Alex! Alex! What are you doing there? - It's that. To hell with civilized, reasonable, rational. Who is it? Who is Charlie? Now out with it! Out with it! Out with it! - But you just said it didn't matter. - I want to know his name, address and length of service. - Get out. - Get out. I'm not getting out until. I'm not leaving until I find out exactly-- - You aren't staying. - You better not-- - Mm. Ah! - And then for the first time I wasn't able to make it. I just couldn't do it. - It happens. - Oh not to me it doesn't ever. It's a horrible experience. - Hang on. Liven it up a bit, it's like a minuet. - Come on girls and boys feel it more. Nice supple shoulders. Come on, be groovy. Come on. - Harry. Did you hear me, I couldn't do it. - Well it's all in the movement of the shoulders. - No it's all right Arthur. No he's not on the account. - I'm not on the what? - It's the design and graphics people on our breakfast food account. Their creative thinking's rigidified so I introduced this rhythm and counter-group therapy to re-stimulate their free associating mechanism. Seems to be working well, yeah. - [Alex] It's more than I am. - Look it's what they call psychological impotence. It's not at all uncommon. In fact there's hardly a dirty book that doesn't feature it. - Thank you. - [Harry] Look all you have to do is-- - I know what I have to do. There's only one cure for me. Harry, so long as that statue stands-- - You fall. - Exactly. And there's only one way to get rid of the statue and everything else and that's for me to follow through on all the names on that list. - Completely reliable source. No less than the Paraguayan council senor trustworthy himself. - Joachim. That's the second piece of scandal I've heard about. Alex Bolt might not like it. - I thought he wouldn't. - This Unispeak operation fowls up I stand directly in the line of fire. - An unaccustomed position. There's also that 50 grand hunk of model you commissioned. Are you sure you're off the air? I don't wanna get those worry beads red hot but shouldn't someone at least take a look at it? - How? - Suppose the President. - The President? - He called me this morning, a personal request. - The President? He's interested in sculpture? - [Ray] One of our nation's greatest connoisseurs. - Are we talking about this-- - Yes. Whatever that statue is, he said, let me make myself perfectly clear. I want a model of it right on my desk. - Oh, in that case I can't refuse anymore can I. (hums Hail to the Chief) - Oh my God! That's what I said Mr President. Bare ass. No it isn't a bad line sir. Damn thing's a mile high and naked as a peeled banana. Sir when I unveil it. Correction, if I unveil it you know what my face will be right alongside? You better believe it. The photos of that freaky two-shot will fly it around the world. Imagine what the Democrats will be calling me from that moment on. Yes sir I know I've been called one before sir but only. You bet sir. We certainly will prevent it sir. Mr President. How? Well. What does my advisory staff have to offer? General? - It's hardly a military problem. - Excellent. Legal? - Her contract stipulates a sculpture on any theme of her own choice. Clause seven. - Who the hell agreed to that clause? What does the head of the CIA have to offer? - Well perhaps we put a tail on Mr Bolt. - Now she thinks of it. - Hunter, would you get onto it dear. (rhythmic music) - Mr Bernstein please. Yes, yes I'll hang on. That Time Magazine man's given up on you. They're doing a cover story on Ray Whitely instead. - Oh bully for him. How often did this Bernstein visit? - Well Dunhill says at least once a week. He's your wife's marble supplier. Oh Mr Bernstein? I'm speaking on behalf of Mr Alex Bolt. Mr Bolt wondered whether you'd care to accompany him on a visit to Sunnyfields this afternoon. Yes. Yes it is a nudist colony but. Oh. Oh he's gone. Well no no I didn't know that. Well (speaking in foreign language) No no that's Unispeak for (speaking in foreign language). He's committed this afternoon, he's at the Synagogue. It's his son's Bar Mitzvah. - Doesn't that.

What were you doing in the studio? - Rhonda, you light up the night. That uh-- - What were you doing in the studio? - little surprise I mentioned earlier. Suggested by no less than the President himself, come on. When I described the statue to the President he came up with this one little suggestion. I tell you you're going to kick yourself that you didn't think of it. - You. You vandal! - Now at least try and think about it. I mean sculpturally statues have them, you know. - Not my statue! - All the great ones. Greek, Roman. No no it's only on with Scotch tape, that's all right. Well I tried to do what they asked me to do. - Did your President really-- - Rhonda, just relax. Let's just think about his suggestion. Try and keep our options open. Did you ever look into Eastern philosophy? (gentle music) - Oh these. - Sake. Mm hmm. Try some of this. This is (speaking in foreign language) - Thank you. - It's sushi. It's lovers' food. - Mm. - You sort of share it. - Thank you. Mm good. - I just want you to. Appreciate my State Department's position. I mean if we unveil it the way it is every do-gooder and morality organization in the world is going to be screaming at us for encouraging nudity. - Nudity? - Permissiveness. - Sure sure, yeah yeah. - Decadent Americans. - Mm hmm. - If we don't unveil all the pinko intellectuals are gonna be yelling censorship, repression. - Sure. - Philistine American Understand Rhonda, I mean I have no personal ax to grind. I love it the way it is. - [Rhonda] A bit salty though. - Yeah. Not the statue. - Oh, oh the statue. Mr Ambassador, have you ever seen a man wear a fig leaf? - I've never looked. And somewhat obliquely related to that I saw Alex at the Turkish baths the other day. - Alex? - Uh huh. - He hates them baths. They make him feel dizzy. - Hmm. What's he been doing since he came back? - Going away again. - Don't you get lonely sometimes? - Sometimes yes. (excited chatter) (speaking in foreign language) - On time. Just like God damn Japanese trains. (romantic music) - No staying long I am working here. Uh huh, you just coming in for another look at the statue. - It's beautiful Rhonda. But marble. This is softer and warmer. - Hmm, weaker. Don't confuse me Ray, it's too easy at the moment. - Well it's not easy for either of us. When two people are lonely. Two Scorpios. So smooth. So wantable. - [Rhonda] Ray. Ray no-- - What's the harm? - You mustn't. - Darling Rhonda just-- - No please. Oh that's not fair. - [Ray] Let me just undo it. - [Rhonda] Ray what are you? - [Ray] Please Rhonda. - [Rhonda] No. No please you'll tear my-- - [Ray] You drive a man absolutely. - No Ray you. You'll ruin my. (giggling) He looks like he's appealing to the Empire. Oh! - This is not America's finest hour. - Has he gone out of his skull? I want you to get me eight by 10s of all of these. - Do I keep after him? - Yes lovely dear. - I still think Mr Ambassador a personal overture to Mrs Bolt. If you were to put it to her-- - I tried, she put it back. Must be some kind of exhibitionist obsession. - [Man] He has really freaked out. - What's on his mind? (soaring music) - I do believe it's Alex Bolt. - No it can't be. - It can't be. - What would he be doing here? - It is. It is, have a look. - [Pat] If this works you'll be able to cross three names off at one go. - If only they didn't all have their wives with them. So difficult to make men strip when they have their wives around. I'll bet it's that tall fellow. - No that's a fallacy. - Keep your mind on what we're gonna do will you. - Come on let's go down and greet them. - Hey, hey! - [Man] Hello, hello, what a surprise. (talking over each other) - [Man] Hey nothing happened to Rhonda? - Oh no no no, heavens no. No I just wanted to trap you into signing a petition that's all. - Petition? - Petition? - Yes we're trying to get them to move the British Museum Library to another building. - You mean you came all this way? - Just for that? - Can you think of a more important cause? - No, no very good. - No no of course not. Sign it George, sign it. - I imagine you gentlemen are leading figures in the art world. - Some people are marvelous. Imagine all that for a library. - Well you know some of those shelves are literally bending under the weight. Well when you sign we'll be onto our next port of call. We're going to Sardinia, a lot of people there-- (shouts of protests) - [Man] You're staying to lunch. - Oh you are kind. (talking amongst each other) - [Man] I think it depends who you're married to. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but my contention is that after a certain time husbands and wives don't even look at each other anymore. (shouts of protest) No no wait wait, it's very easy to check this. Now George. In what order does your wife put on her clothes? (laughing) Well in the morning. You've been watching her do it for 12 years for God's sake. What does she put on first, what does she put on second, what does she put on third and so on. - Yeah well, first she puts on her bra. - Oh idiot! First I put on my. First I put on. I don't even wear a bra. - [Man] Don't you? - No. - Zoe, Zoe what about you? What about your husband? - Ah his socks. - No I don't. - Yes you do. - No I put on my. - No no no wait wait wait wait wait wait. Now just a minute. Wait wait wait, let's do this properly. Let's play a little sociological game. Oh Miss Trapshaw you don't happen to have any paper do you? - And pencils? - Pencils too? Good, pass them round. Now here's what we do. Husbands you write down the order in which you think your wives put on their clothes. Wives, you write down the order in which you think your husbands dress. Miss Trapshaw and I will then check. - All right, well just so that's it's not all merely sociological let's put a little money on it. - Is this for the British Museum? (laughing) - This says I'm not more than one stocking wrong. - Well this says that I make no mistakes. She doesn't wear so much anyway. - Shut up George. Listen I still want to know how you two check whether we're right. - Oh you recreate it for us. (rhythmic music) - Wife swapping? With money changing hands. A peeping tom. I just can't believe it of Alex Bolt. I. Believe it. You get eight by 10s of these? That clinches it. We move in. - You miserable fur-lined ocean going-- - No use blustering Alex. You're sick. You're a middle-aged thrill-seeker. You realize what these photos prove him to be? A wife-swapping homosexual exhibitionist voyeur. - A man for all seasons. - It could ruin you, you understand. - Oh I'm quick at things like that. - On the other hand I could hush them up. But in return I'd want something Alex. - I thought you might. - A statement. One that would prevent that statue from going up. An admission that you posed for it only because the balance of your mind was disturbed. - I never posed for it at all! - On don't be ridiculous Alex I've seen the statue. - It's not all him. - We can? Thank you Mr President. Full resources. Certainly sir. Goodbye. Let's have quiet. Wake him up. I've just been in conference with my president. - Groovy. - What it boils down to is to obtain the legal injunction against that statue we have to put a name to its unknown warrior. - How can I put a name to him when I don't know who he is? - The President said find out. - What do you think I've been doing? Just look where some of those people are. Amsterdam, Brazil, Tennessee, Greece. - But now you have help. From hereon the entire resources of the United States of America are on the job.

Degrading. - Still only two names left. Guido Martinenllo and Jack Tremont. - Jack Tremont is a sex mad artist. You know where I've got to go to find him. To a monastery in Greece. - He's a monastery painter? - He's a painter painter. He painted Rhonda's portrait. Every now and then he withdraws to the monastery to charge up his batteries I suppose. And do a little work. It seems that elsewhere he's too easy distracted by women. Any women. All women. - [Harry] Why do you have to go this time? What happened to those full resources of the Unites States? - [Alex] Oh these monks are a closed order. Anyone else it would take them six weeks to get a permit but for a Nobel prize winner. - [Harry] Well aren't you the lucky one. (upbeat music) - Look maybe we're making a mistake about this fellow Tremont. After all he did was paint a picture of Rhonda. - Over a period of six weeks. - Let me look at that. - Taking notes all the time. - All right. All right but just tell brother upstairs there to take it easy. - Ssh. (upbeat music) - And say mister, the monks take a vow of silence. - Good morning. - Ssh. - Good morning. - Ssh. (humorous music) - [Alex] That's my wife you're talking about! I know what's been going on! I know! (shouting) I know about you and Rhonda. Bloody sex mad artists are all alike. Posing for each other in the nude. You're the one who modeled for it! You're the one who modeled for it, I know! I know it! I can prove it! You're the one! You're not through with me yet. Charlie! Charlie! (loud clattering) (rhythmic music) (helicopter engine roaring) (humorous music) (gentle music) - No! No no it's not him. It's not him, no! (shouting) - Well that does it. I won't play ball anymore. - What do you mean he won't play ball anymore? - I'll give you his exact words. There is a limit of moral squalor, he said. - Beyond which I'm not prepared to go. This whole operation, I said, has become downright degrading. That's what I said. From here on, I said. - Count me out, he said. No more chasing after complete strangers, he said. I'm through. - I'm through, I just don't care anymore. - Now he doesn't care anymore but we're only two days off the unveiling ceremony. - I pointed that out. - [Alex] I said screw the unveiling ceremony. - Mm. - Yeah? Well that's like saying screw me. - A hideous prospect. - All right, up until now my better nature stood in my way. Now nothing stands in my way. Come in! Plan S. - S? - For statue. Or saw. (tense music) (loud sawing) (police sirens blaring) - I already told you to get my husband. - They used rubber gloves sir. - There are no fingerprints on this either. - [Man] The window's been forced sir. - My husband-- - Is unlikely to have forced a window madam. - You've got some super things here Mrs Bolt. - Thank you. - Sergeant Hillcrest is our art expert. - [Policeman] The commissioner wants to speak to you sir. Urgently. - Hello. Yes sir. And lopped off clean as a whistle. And no, no trace of it yet sir. Well I'll ask her. If we find it madam will you be able to stick it back on again? - Oh. Get them out of there! - All right Fairbright, relax. I'll call you back sir. Madam have you noticed anyone lately behaving in a suspicious manner? - Yes I just told you to get my husband. - We will keep your suggestion in mind madam. - And I just want it back. - But we have to consider every possibility. - Yes, no use us just charging off half. Beautiful. Isn't it. - [Harry] Well I think you're wrong Alex. You're over-elated, I don't like it. - [Alex] Well you people just aren't used to observing a return to sanity. - When you've only got one name left to check. Who's in Florence, name of Guido Martinello. Do you know him? - Guido Martinello. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care who Guido Martinello is or what he did with Rhonda. I'm going back home. - But when he's the only one you've got left to check. All it means is one flight to Florence. - [Alex] No more flights, I'm going home. - Well I don't think you should. You've got a lot of unresolved hostility there. A hard core of residual aggression. - Harry! You're talking like a psychiatrist. - I am a psychiatrist. - Do you wanna know something? You're an advertising man. I think I prefer a sinking ship to a sinking lifeboat. - You're wrong Alex. Psychologically you've sublimated your anxieties into screaming hysteria. You see. (romantic music) - Hello love. - I've been expecting you. - Darling. - Oh! - Darling what is it. If it's the statue forget it. I mean I can learn to live with it. Really, anything you say. Ooh. Oh no. Oh I wouldn't do that to anyone. - Oh yes you did. Because it was the only way you could come back home. Now I will tell you. I did have a model for that. And he's more of a man than you will ever be. - We believe Mr Bolt has left the country. Yes sir we have contacted Interpol. No sir, I am not convinced. I still think it was a professional job. Yes sir, Mrs Bolt is drawing a sketch of it for us now. Yes sir, exactly what it looked like. We'll have the sketch duplicated and put up outside every police station in the country. Inside every police station in the country. Get BBC television to show it on the news? Well it might take a bit of persuasion. - In the House of Lords today Lord Brecombe deplored sexual promiscuity among young people. Referring to the government publication in place of cold showers he recommended compulsory courses of-- - [Policeman] I never thought the BBC would agree. Wait till the thief sees this. - [Hillcrest] Should look fantastic in color. - The latest art theft. - Ah. - Earlier today the police issued this detailed description of the missing segment of the statue. - This should make it too hot for any thief to try and get rid off. - It is a piece of marble measuring approximately 126 cubic inches and weighing about 5 1/2 pounds. Now here is a late football result. Manchester City two Yugoslav Dynamos four. - [Policeman] You can't trust anybody. - I don't know, those Dynamos are a very good team. - Well you'll have to help us now Mrs Bolt. - All right. My husband took it. - Everything points to a professional job. - My husband took it. - There's a very big market in art treasures. - A fragment of a Rhonda Bolt work. I mean imagine if someone were trying to flog the missing arms of the Venus de Milo. - And there's two of those. (phone rings) Hello? - My husband took it. - Sir, Interpol from Florence. (upbeat music) - Senor Guido Martinello? (speaking in foreign language) - Senor Bolt. In here please. Senor Bolt. I'm Guido Martinello. I told Rhonda this, the classical style, is the style she should've turned to. And she obviously did. It's very pleasant to know that she still listens to her old teacher. - But Mr Martinello I must find out who this is. - Oh it's a very well known gentleman in Florence. You'll find him. (rhythmic music) What are you doing? Senor Bolt! (speaking in foreign language) - Thank you Mr Martinello. (uplifting music) (speaking in foreign language) - What you see now, ladies, is the greatest statue of the classical style. The most famous work of sculpture in all Florence. Carved in 1501 by the noblest sculptor the world has ever known. Ladies, this is the Michelangelo statue of David. - Charlie. (giggling) - Joan, Caroline, what are you giggling about? - I only said Miss Brown, if that's David I'd like to see Goliath.
