Normal phone cards give you a 100 minutes of calls. This one lets you call as much as you want. What if we get caught? What did she ask? If we can trust you. There's no problem! This month alone, I'v sold 20 of them... No one ever complained! There's no problem. No one's complained. She thinks you're a thief. A thief? Oh, come on... These are real phone cards. Look. I'll give you a code for each card. Think it over, but not too long. They're going fast. What are you wearing, Antoinette? Get out, on the double! I forgot my bathing suit. What a coincidence! Hey, baker-lady! What a biscuit! "Confessions of a wimp:" "I, Boni Pavone, pizza chef," "living in my dead mother's house in Marseilles" "and wallowing in incredibly obscene Fantasies" "about a woman built like a brick shithouse, "a baker's wife saddled with a hushand and three brats" "I do solemnly swear to fuck her brains out" "to love every last minute of it" "and to brag about it everywhere before dropping her," "once I've milked this stupid joke" "for all its worth." "I swear on my mother's grave" she scratches my balls... "that no one or nothing will stop me." "If ever I don't keep this oath," "may I be branded a coward" "like my asshole father who left us" "and may my ass burn in hell eternally." Is it the wind that's got you so jittery? I don't like them shitting in my yard. At night, at the house, when the kids are in bad, she comes, Quiet! So what happens? She hits the big load! Get it? The big load! Hey, what's up? Can I have a slice of pizza? The oven's off. I hope they're good rods. Where's it from? Taiwan. Open one, Dad. See if it's good stuff. Nice! She buys a Banco while I'm at the bar. She scratches the thing and wins 5 francs. So she buys another one. Put it all in the kitchen. I'll never finish this fucking joke. What's your problem? It doesn't work. Why not? It makes lousy coffee. It tastes bad because you smoke too much. I get my kicks where I can. I'm not a chain store! You put water in it? What do you think? Take it back. I want one that's old, like me. You're sure you want that kind? It's a deal. An Italian stove-top. Nice and dusty, just like you. Into the kitchen, please. Take this too. I just got it in. Do me a favor and go now. I have company. I act nice and you shit on me! Right. Happy fishing. I'm sick of mine. I want one like this. With a built-in clock. Got it in black? Forget that. Italian stove-tops. Make the best coffee. That makes American donkey piss. Here you go. Black, with a built-in alarm clock. Look at my coffee maker. It's phat! Stupid fresh! What did you want? There's a built-in phone? No, it's an alarm clock. I want one of these. A mini-harpoon? One of these fishing rods. Can I drop you off? No thanks. Where are you going? Let me give you a ride. Come on, climb in. She goes down an empty street. She's about thirty. Slim waist, large thighs... The way she walks is provocative. It all goes like clockwork. She goes through the gate. I jump over it and I'm beside her. "I'm gonna stick my big dick up your crack." I come up behind her. I push her through the open doors of the shed. I put one hand on her stomach. I push her down with the other. She bends over. I hike up her skirt. She's naked underneath. I stroke her ass. "You're gonna feel it deep down, every last inch of it." I shove my cock in her. She barely puts up a fight. My daughter collects phone cards like yours. Can I take a picture of it? I've never seen that one. Hurry up or I'll miss my train. Thanks. She'll be thrilled. You don't want the bun? You want it? Hey there, co( you sure can drop turds. Good morning. How are you? Can you feel my hot French stick? Can you feel that hot stick of mine? I'll eat her up. I'll eat her up. We're all set. Let's go. Luis, leave the key behind the sign! Get in. A French stick too. Nice and soft? Do I get a ticket? 11 francs 20. You better wake up. Don't you ever sleep at night? Hello Colette. A nice soft one? I'll take two. My grandkids are visiting. Thanks of the exact change. Hold on. Don't forget this. Have a nice day. What's that? A raffle ticket. We have to keep up with the competition. What's the grand prize? It's right in front of your face. This basket! Anything else? A nice, long French stick. They're all the same length. I'll give you a toasty one. 3 francs 20. My raffle ticket. Do you have a cigarette? Looking for someone? A light too. Can I come in? If you want to. Open up. You're a mechanic? I'm just fiddling around. Nothing serious... I'm starving. There's no food. Make yourself at home! By the way, what's your name? Vanessa. Can you pay? I'm broke. Do I get to see you again? I don't know. Maybe. I have to go. Two slices of cheese pizza. That's 24 francs for the two. Any Marlboros? I can't sell cigarettes. I'll go see. Fuck this. Look at me. I got sauce all over my apron. Let's go. We're out of here. What are you doing? I'm going to sleep. How about you? I'll hang out with Luis. I have to tell you, I met a girl... Good-looking? She's bumpin'. She's zen. She's killer zen. I like her. She's awesome. I'm going to hang around the area. Maybe I'll bump into her. See you later. So long. She stopped by the house. Oh yeah? She was passing by. You want to eat? Don't brood. It's me. Did you pretend not to recognize me this morning? Why are you in my house? This is my house. Get lost. It's my mother's house. Get the hell out. It's Mom's house! She shitted and you come out! You're not her daughter! When she was dying, you never visited. You're not ashamed to be here? Okay, I get it. Keep your scuzzy house. It sucks here. Ther's no food. I heard you sell pizza now. You're really pathetic. What a family of retards! Jerk off in peace. Take your shitty little bunny! What the fuck? Lay off my rabbit! Go back to sugar daddy. He's your daddy too and I'd never go there. You two belong together! Why are you screaming? Can't you see I ran away? I just wanted to talk, asshole. Write me a letter. I do what I fucking want! Pain in the ass! Good morning! This is my turf, co(o. Come here, you bitches. Come and eat Daddy! Don't ever snoop in my things! Go fuck your baker-lady! Why do you write such smut? You're a total pervert! What's the gun for? Target practice. You don't work today? I work when I feel like it. You've changed. It's normal. You got a little fat. No, I've grown. Why won't you go home? Because I'm pregnant. Sure you are. It's no joke. It's true. It doesn't show. I have a small belly. Does your father know? You're sure you're pregnant? Yeah, I did the test. When did you find out? None of your business. It's none of my business? You screw up my day and it's not my business? You came here to hide out, didn't you? Boni, get off my case! I've been up for two days. Hey. What's up? How are you, Vannesa? I'm just great. Sorry, you have to leave. Who's she? She's one weird bitch. She's my sister. Watch it! You never said you had a sister! You got a filthy mouth. Stop freaking out! She's really your sister? Who did it to you? He doesn't exist. Have you got amnesia? No, he just doesn't exist. You're just into dates and boys and girls. What am I going to do? I don't want "Mr Light-Bright" here! Go back to his place! Boni, go easy on the bag. Put on some gloves. Now try hitting: Left, left, right. Come on! Move your ass! Let me tie this. Left, left, right! Use your legs too! Sweat it out! Give it all you got! Harder! It's Nenette. What happened to Nenette? An accident? She's disappeared from school. No one's seen her. You bawled her out. She ran away. I searched her room. I didn't find a thing. And you imagine the worst. I'm in big trouble. As usual. But even if you fucked up, why would she be involved? I can't tell you. If yo don't want to talk, don't talk. You're imagining things. When you get home. She'll be there feeling sorry. What if she isn't? Then it's serious. You'll have to try the hospitals, the police... I have already. She has a boyfriend. They all have boyfriends. Sometimes even two or three. Girls are complicated. Nenette's like any other. And... don't bawl her out when you see her. It gives them all sorts of bad ideas. Eat Felix. You're not eating. Don't bust my balls with your spaghetti! How about your son? You remember you have one? I haven't seen him since his mother's funeral. The little brat hates my guts. How about you? Do you love him? Do you ever see him? Of course I do. Is he doing okay? Ask him yourself. I gave him my pizza van. School bored the shit out of him. 18 years old, no diploma what could he do? Now he has Aline's roof over his head and my pizza van. Don't worry, Felix. We'll find Nenette. Drink up. These noodles are lousy. Go sleep in the other bed. Can you hear me? Move your ass! I can't believe this! Who told you to do the dishes? This isn't your house! Are you crazy? I'm looking at you. Sleep. Why are you stripping? I'm borrowing a tee-shirt. You never wash your clothes? They stink. It's gross. It's my stink. I like it. I don't want to go! You know him? Yeah, from the phone book. If he's sleazy, I'll leave! Relax. Breathe deeply. There. Very good. I'd say you're at least 5-months pregnant. But I've barely gotten fat. That doesn't mean a thing. It's your build. An ultrasound will tell us more. Knock, knock! Who's there? Is anyone there? There's no one! You lied to me. You're not 18. It's my job to be able to tell. Just tell me how much I owe you. Who's the boy in the waiting room? Your friend? My husband, but he doesn't want to keep it either. Would you mind stepping in here? This is none of his business. It is. He has to face up to his responsibility. Is it serious? No, everything's fine. Sit down. Here. You won't have any hospital bills to pay. How much do we owe you? I need to know how pregnant you are. I'm counting on you for the ultrasound. Your wife is confused, but it's only normal. A well-planned childbirth can be wonderful. What's all that money? Some girls at school chipped in. Give it back. You cost me a lot. So now you're not getting an abortion? Nothing's decided yet. What's wrong? They're not working? There's no work. It's not my fault if there's no work. Drop us at the beach. Get out. Why? Are you crazy? Out, I said! Get out! How do I get home? That's your problem. Don't worry, Vanessa. Forget about it. Boni! I know she's here! Next time I'll kill you! Nenette! Daddy understands! He won't ask any questions! We'll start over from scratch! Boni, let me in! Don't come any closer! Kids, does he still have the rifle? Does he still have it? Very good. Everything looks fine. Look. You can see its profile. Look. I don't care. Do you want to know if it's a boy or a girl? Anyway, he's kicking up a storm. I'd say you're in your 7th month of pregnancy. Now you'll need to do a bloodtest to see if you're HIV-positive. That'll be it. Would you like a Polaroid? Let's get something clear. If you're thinking of aborting, it's too late. Get dressed. Dumb bitch. I'll have it alone somewhere and kill it. It won't come out. It hates me. Shut up! You want me to stay? I had a funny feeling that I'd bump into someone I know. What are you doing? I'm not working today. You want a coffee? I love Christmas. You're not a big talker. That's what a customer told me today. I answered: "Whatever could I say?" I like it here. I never have any time. It's nice to meet someone from the neighborhood. What's your name? Boniface. Now I'll know. Smell. What does it remind you of? I don't know. Just skin. I barely use any perfume since I read the article. I'm afraid it'll cover up that famous molecule, Pheronome... something like that. There's a chemical reaction between men and women. These invisible things send off signals... They say things like: "You turn me on" or "I'm available." It's crazy! They're in everything: In truffles, in oysters... in beer, in flowers... In other things too. There's even a molecule like it, not the same one, but almost that works on animals. And female pigs, when they get sprayed with it... it drives them crazy. But it's totally unfair. Some people have tons of these molecules. And others have almost none. So you can pour perfume all over yourself, But it won't do a thing. You're out of luck. They're like invisible fluids. See what I mean? They're like... You like that, don't you? Yeah, you sure do. It's so good. Yeah, it's good! Don't move... I'm kneading you hard! Great view! You can see clear across town. He lives like a prince, our little Felix. Business is dead. No customers. We're willing to believe you. That costs money! See? You do have some. Go make coffee. We woke up early. You're a lousy host. We have to ask. How long have I known you? Mr Light-Bright... Are you here? It's Dad. How are you? You're like me. You like to feel comfortable. Here. It's oil, sugar, steak and coffee. Where should I put it? Here? You don't want to talk to me? I'm a modern guy. Let bygones be bygones. You're older than me in your head. Your mother and I stopped getting along. It happens. Let me tell you... Your mother was never a real woman with me. Get it? She didn't care about that stuff. She only cared about her son. Get it, Boni? Need I say more? Pack up your shit and get lost! I don't need you! Nenette! I know you're in here. Answer me! What did I do to you? Tell me! Tell Daddy! Why are you hiding? Jesus, you have a heart of stone! Won't you come home, honey? Come home with me! Come home. I love you. I love you, Nenette. I'm down on my knees! Go cry your crocodile tears somewhere else. I'm worried. Worried for you and your sister. I brought you lobster bisque. You like that? I'll be moving soon. I was sick of that aparment. It needed work done. I'm buying a hacienda. I found one near Plan-de-Cuques. Come whenever you want. You'll have a room. Nenette too, if she wants to. You know what I'd like? All three of us to be together. As for the rest... You can give birth anonymously. You won't tell us your name... your identity... we'll find a foster family. We call this a "Jane Doe" birth. I have to make sure you understand one thing. Your decision is irreversible. But it's a feasible solution. Just remember: Once you've decided, there's no turning back. But as I've said, it will have a family. Is it the phone company? Yeah, I'll take the call. Like I told the woman this morning. I was floored when I got my last pill. 15,576 francs! I almost had a heart attack! Usually it's no more than 800. I have the bill... Right here in front of me. Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City... I've never called Vietnam in my life. You say it doesn't exist, but I saw it in you. It'll have a family. But no name? Yeah, the family's name. You're like an animal. Worse than an animal. What stinks? What are you doing? It stinks! Answer me! I can feel it moving. What are you doing? I'm making room. Soon you'll have lots of room. Is she next? A Jane Doe. I'm starving. I'll be in the cafeteria. See you later. Hello. It better not hurt. It's too late, sweetie. And don't moralize me. You have an attitude problem! I have nothing against Jane Does. But it's too late for anesthesia. You had to ask earlier. Let me help you get dressed. Give me your head. What are you doing here? Get lost! I was looking for you. Get him out of here! You'll have to go now. Leave her alone. My sister's a minor. She's allowed to be! Bernard, take him out. Don't leave me alone. Fuck! Fuck! This fucking hurts! Can't you use another word? I hate this! It hurts! I know it hurts. Try pushing! You're not pushing! You don't want to! Harder! Push! Again. There you go... Breathe deep. I want this to end! Go on, sweetie! Breathe! Harder! Do you want him on your belly? Do you want to see him? What do you want? A Peugeot headlight. This is all I have. Later in the week? Yeah, I'll have one next week. Nasser, where's my pizza? Where are you going? Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. You pissed on me. Yeah, you pissed on me. Subtitles: Andrew Litvack
