Sorry. Are you hurt? Your nose is bleeding. That had stopped! - Dance? - I don't want to. - You can't enjoy yourself. - No. Shit! Whose side are you on, bride or groom? Neither. I'm here for the photos. That's great! Maybe it's best if we don't leave together. This is the last time I marry. Go on. Shit! A new extinguisher! The bastards! There's the alarm. That cost 300. You'll need petrol, Nordine brought it back empty. OK. It'll be back tonight, anyway. - What will you do? - See the insurance... Oh. Chez Casto, y a tout ce qu'il faut Tous les matériaux Casto, Casto, Castorama - Will you be OK? - Yes. Back late tonight? Around 8, after work. I'll cook something for you if you like. A little slice of cow's liver. What shall I bring? Nothing. Yes, bread. Our baker's rubbish. - Thanks. - We can't change every 6 months. - Is it reimbursed by the State? - I think so. A local anaesthetic? I've no idea. How does the morning after pill work? The morning after pill is... The coffees! I really don't know. It's no use taking it two weeks later not even if you take several. Something's wrong. What happened? Did you put the film in the machine? I wound it back myself. I've never had any problems. In fact, you put the roll in properly and depress the notches. Was it important? Yes it was. What will I tell my wife? - Hadn't you seen her before? - At the synagogue. - Was it love, then? - Not at all! I had screwed for 7 months. It was hormonal. That doesn't explain it all. We're not animals. - We are! - We are a bit. - Was it good? - Yes. See? I was right. - That's wild! - What? I know who it is. It's Mrs Abitbol. Incredible! It's the first time I've seen someone I know. Patrick! Patrick! Come and see. It's my mother's neighbour. Mrs Abitbol. Well, Jean-Mi. Very well. Drive! You'll miss your train because of her. No. I've never missed one yet. What time is it? 9:15? Too early. It'd look like you thought of him all night. - Got your toilet bag? - What for? We all need a toilet bag. If you want to shave or brush your teeth... - No. - What do you mean? I won't clean them this time. I wonder if I should book a hotel. The man should do that. Otherwise it'd look... What's on tonight? What? - Staying in? - No. I have to see Mimi. - With Alain? - No. Without. Restaurant? I've no idea. I have to call her. Go on! Engage second! Don't care. I'll honk if I like. - See you tomorrow. - Have a good trip, darling. Hi, Shermann. Hortense here. Sorry for calling early but I'll be hard to reach. But I'm OK for tonight. We mentioned Tuesday night. I've arranged it. I can come. You can reach me on my mobile or at the office. Hello? Sorry, I thought... - What's wrong? - Forgot my ticket. Oh, right. - Goodbye. - Have a good trip. Goodbye. Mr Degombert! I don't know if I can get it all at once. It's a proper farm in there! If you don't help with this, it'll double in a week. "Dear Maurice, I absolutely must see you. "I'll be in Paris on Tuesday December 17." What date is it? "I tried in vain to reach you. Perhaps the line is down. "Could I come round at 7 pm on the 17th?" Tuesday the 17th. "Looking forward to seeing you... Jane." Yes, Shermann. Hortense again. I'll try to call you at the bar. You're never there in the mornings. I'll wait till you call. What have you eaten this morning, Maxence? Cornflakes and loads of bread and butter. Cornflakes? I should have called last night. But I can't keep calling. I don't see why he didn't call. He should have done. He knows very well we're meeting tonight. - What do you want? - A wee-wee. Want a wee-wee? Let's go. Dr Alouf never consults on Tuesday mornings. Shall I let you go alone? Tomorrow, 3:30? See you then. Yes, Hortense? I'm expecting an important call. From Shermann. Can you put him straight through? Thank you. Isn't your little twinset new? Why? It suits you. It goes with your hair... Thank you. Come in. Don't mind the mess. Shall we kiss? You look well. - Fancy a drink? - Why not. So you live here. Yes. It's very light. South-facing. You can see the sunset on summer nights. So what are you doing? What am I doing... After you left, I tried carrying on alone, but my heart wasn't in it. I tried starting a new life with Monique... but it was too soon: I was still thinking of you. What about your love story with the cameraman? Still together? - What was his name? - Gilbert. Gilbert Letélec. He died. - Oh! Sorry. - I killed him. - What? - But I paid my debt. Fifteen years in jail. Parole at Christmas. That's nice. Maurice, I'm sorry I left you. Gilbert was... he was a monster: vulgar, violent, paranoid, perverted, hypocritical, mean, dirty, impotent, uncultured... stupid. Yes, move to the back, please. Thank you. Thank you. What are you doing here? Keep moving. Drive on. You gave me such a fright! Sorry, I didn't mean to. Shouldn't you be at work? Yes. Is the canteen closed? No. I asked for the day off. Leguerre won't take my billiard table. We could swap. - I like the 4 Seasons. - No, it's all right, thanks. Sure you're not interested? It's really not expensive. This isn't the time. What's got into them all? Nothing. I expected the gastro-enteritis epidemic from Greece. - Not a thing. - Flu will be here soon. Hello? Doctor's surgery. Evelyne! - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Out with it. - Nothing, really. Expecting a call? No. Anyway, I know that sort. Give an inch and they take a mile. Sorry, I'm generous. It's the way I am. If that scares them, it's their problem. They're threatened by a little loving. And you wonder why there are wars everywhere. Can't you say you had a nice evening? It's the least you could do. Who does she mean? - His name's Shermann. - It wasn't that great. I talked, he must have said 2 lines. You've still time. The pregnancy is recent. It's a major decision. It's OK, I've thought about it. - You talked to the father? - No. - Maybe you should. - He doesn't know. Well now's the time to tell him. His wife doesn't know either. - You like children? - I'm back at work in half an hour. Can we speed it up? I can't help you, my clinic doesn't practice abortions. What should I do, then? Once again, you must think about what your act entails. I don't think you understand. He screwed me at a wedding. I was totally pissed. The groom never called me. Doesn't know my name. We didn't wear a condom. Good job it's not Aids. What can I do? Go to Family Planning? - How much do I owe you? - 350 francs. Do you take lunch vouchers? If it's because of the other message... - What message? - The one where he misses me. If he took that wrong... What does he think? It was just nice. Dead nice. We hadn't spoken in a week. No. Do you believe that? No. Forget it. Forget it. I should have kept my mouth shut. Maybe, yes. Sometimes it's best. It's like that with my brother. I didn't call for 3 months. He gave in. You made up with your brother? Well! Would he like my billiard table? He's got room in his house. I made a flan. Want some? If it's as good as the clafoutis... Thank you. I heard you, Marco. I could put an ad for the table in the waiting room. - My mobile! - It's here. Hello? Yes, darling. No. I'm having lunch right now. Yes... OK. See you later. So you got your call!! It was Antoine! - From the conference in London? - Yes. That's great that they call each other just to say hello. He said he'd arrived. It's absolutely wonderful. Right, I'll be getting back. - Evelyne... - I've accounting to do... Hortense, what time are you back? Not late, I've only 2 visits. - What would you do? - I don't know, Hortense. - What would you do? - I don't know. He used to call 3 times a day, now I can't get hold of him. I don't understand. I'd play dead. Then if he calls, he calls. - And if he doesn't? - Then he's a jerk. Not worth it. If he doesn't call then I'm not worth it. I'm sorry. Do you know how to fill in a report? I don't know where the papers are. It's my husband's. And I'm late for my yoga class. I... What do we do? Can I call your mobile? No, I don't have one. Do you have a work number? Yes. OK. Patricia Shermann. I'll call you later. Thanks. My number! - You didn't take my number! - Sorry, I'm muddled. Are you ok? Sorry? No. I mean... It must be nice to be you. - It's all right. - The car, the clothes, husband, the yoga... You're great. If you smarten up, you're great. Do you have children? Yes, two. Four and a half and two. I do take care. I'm not witty. You know? I've no repartee. People next to me at dinners get bored. Most women look at me with scorn, rather like you did. Two seconds! - Are you OK? - Fine, just a bit jet-lagged. I'm in Paris for 3 days. I haven't a minute to myself. I understand. Anyway... is Gilbert Letélec well? Gilbert Letélec? Gilbert Letélec, the cameraman? You remember his name? That's wild! You always said I had a pea brain. A tiny garden pea, in fact. All I was good for was looking pretty on telly. Well, my little pea and me didn't do so badly. Present. One of the classics in our range. And what have you been up to with your large intelligent brain, apart from drinking? No major feats? Opening it? Mauricette. Mauricette... It sounded more French. Tell me, why exactly did you come? To wind you up, Maurice. That's why. That's what I thought. Didn't tell me about the day off this morning. No. I've another 2 hours. If you'd warned me... All right. Done your Christmas shopping? - Luis... - Yes, darling. I've got something to say to you. A problem. I'm leaving. Here, a little more. That's good. More. More. Very good. - No medipresents. - No, Mr Zweibaum. It's important. You must carry on taking your medicine. Yes, I know. Anyway, I won't call. I've queered my pitch enough. I've decided I won't call. So I won't think about it. No. I haven't seen it because at our house we don't have cable. Are you kidding me? - Why didn't you do it sooner? - Because I thought about it. Why didn't you mention it? We can talk, can't we? While I thought about it there was no need to worry. We should have taken time off in November. It's not that. I've been thinking about it for ages. Since summer, in fact. You can't just announce that now. Why? Is it mental cruelty? Thoughtlessness? Settling scores? You see the damage she's doing? Because of women like her, women like me find themselves alone and going mouldy. Or he had a terrible car accident. His life's hanging by a thread and he can't call me. But I won't call. It's Shermann. Deep breath, relax and speak after the tone. Yes, it's Hortense. I don't know... It's 3:03 pm. I hope nothing's happened to you. Take care. Bye. It's Shermann. Deep breath, relax and speak after the tone. It's me again. If you can't, it doesn't matter, but I'd like to be kept uniformed. Informed! Take care. You might have lost my number, so I'll leave it again. It's 06 08 82... Hang on, I forgot my number! 06 08 82 22 03. Shermann, one last thing I forgot. Sucking Tic Tacs is useless. It doesn't work. Bad breath comes from the liver. Take care. Excuse me. Bus stop Samaritaine? I don't know. - Feeling better? - Yes. Fine, thank you. We'll pick up the exercise from last week. No, you can remain sitting, Jean-Noël. We can do it on our seats this time. So relax your shoulders... There. I can feel that relaxing. Perfect. Think of that. One hand on the thorax, one on the abdomen. Go on. Like that. That's perfect. Breathe in and out slowly in three stages. Breathing slower and more relaxed. Do you know about mobiles? Because... How can I erase a message I've left? - You need his... - Phone number? You need his... Secret code? I don't know it! What kind of... Person? Phone? Brrn... les années... Nées. Années... Années. Nées... Les années passent... His date of birth? I don't know it! Right. Let's try again... Your hands on here. When you breathe out, you push and make a noise. More peaceful, more gentle. So I barely hear the sound. He might have used his daughter's date of birth or that of his... - Wife. - Wife. Wife. Yes. By the way, there was a call for you. Who was it? Some guy. Damn it, I've forgotten his name. Something-man. It wasn't... - Paul Newman? - Paul Newman, no. He mentioned something about hitting his wing... You're to meet him at 7 at Bar in the Bastille. - Which bar? - The bar called Bar at the Bastille. To think my cousin and his wife can't have any... They've tried everything. It took me 10 minutes. But we were in a hurry. It's him! Who? Jean-Jacques Goldman? - No, him! - Him who? Him! Go on, please! - No. You go. - Go on! Go on. - Hello. - Hello. - I've come for my photos. - Yes. - Do you have the ticket? - They're wedding photos. - Name of Lassalle. - Oh, yes. Lassalle... Aren't you checking them? We have sliding rates for reprints. No, thanks. I'm in a hurry. He kept looking at you. Didn't say a word. He seems nice. He's coming back! You see? What did I tell you? Come on. This time you go. Hello. Can I help you? - How much is the Polaroid? - 490 francs. It's the last one. They're 30% off. I've got everything. Except for your sister. Yes, a Polaroid. Good idea! You got them? Show me! Who's that? Marie, can you spare a minute? Yes, hello. - What's wrong? - We'll find a solution. What? - Any explanation? - I don't understand. Me neither. We were relying on you. - Why me? - Can this be put right? Well? Sorry, I didn't get that. Could you repeat it? - On this, you can see... - Are you kidding? Your sister's great. All green. She'll be pleased. And if your mother saw that, she'd have a fainting fit. That's OK. - You're glad! - They were perfect! Were they good? - Not good, perfect. - Yves took lots of photos. Sandrine had her camcorder on. Stop it! The negatives have had it. It's not my fault. Sorry. We're sorry. Sorry! I'm sorry. You ruin my wedding and you're sorry. Idiot! - She's an idiot. - You're right. I'm not sorry. I don't care about your wedding, your petits-fours, your dress... You've not lost much. If you'd seen yourself with that face, that "best day of my life" smile... A guinea-fowl in her foul finery! Cluck-cluck! Cluck-cluck! It's up to her if she leaves. Why shouldn't she look elsewhere? She could have prepared things! All right! - No? - Yes... Well, yes... - From before summer? - I don't know, I suppose. Can you make an effort? It is important. Something must have happened for you not to love me. There. And don't bother me with your rights... Professional misconduct. Take that to the tribunal... That's fine! Don't worry. Is it the routine? - What? - The humdrum, the monotony. There could be a way, but is it a good idea? It's his mate. He'd know Shermann's date of birth. And hell, if he isn't there, I won't leave a message. Hi. You've reached Ben, but I'm not here. Later. Maybe he's filtering. Hi, it's Hortense. Are you in? Are you filtering? Hortense Lassalle, sorry. Look, I wanted to ask you something but as you're not in, never mind. Bye. What? - Hey! - What? - Look where you're going! - I'm sorry. - Are those eyes you have? - Yes. I'm sorry. - Excuse me. - Wake up a bit! Don't go on at me! I said I'm sorry. Yes, Evelyne. What? Right, then! Yes. Look... I'm in traffic. I'm just coming. Oh, sorry! Evelyne, I beg your pardon. Could you call and tell the babysitter I won't need her tonight. Thanks, Evelyne. Be right there. Just go to BHV. You can buy Christmas presents... stuff like that... I'll pick you up later. No! We'll stop at a kiosk. - You buy a magazine... - No need. If it's about what happened at Bernard's, last Sunday... I can't hold my drink! There's no need! What if it hurts me? What if it hurts me? How many times? Stop it! You'll hurt yourself. How many times? Give me a figure! Once. Twice a year. Right, I'll be going. Where are we now? What about the stop? Two minutes. I'll be 2 minutes. I'm capable of anything. I'll kill you, then myself. Stop it! That's not funny! What's wrong? Am I not being fair? I mustn't love you enough. My wife is a whore! She's shagged everyone but the carpet. - And whose is Lucie? - She's yours, I swear. She's your spitting image, everyone says so. Yes, Mum, it' me. No, not very well. Yes. Work is fine. This weekend? No, look... I won't be able to make it Next weekend, maybe. That's nice, but I've had my fill of wedding photos. Just say I'm not free. And are you all right? Is Dad's leg better? How's Maurice? I'm seeing him tonight. OK, I'll send your love. Mum... Mum... I wanted to ask you something... How did you have me? Was I wanted? Or was it an accident? No, I haven't had an accident! No! No, it doesn't matter. I have to go. Me too. Leave your mother in peace! Anyway, I can't keep it! It's just as well. I feel almost relieved. Let him hear his message! I don't care. And he does have bad breath! Let go! Let go of everything! Holding for 16 beats is hard... Oh yes, I see. Right. We'll start the same exercise on 4, 8, 10. This time, hold for 12 beats. It'll be easier. You'll manage. Go on. That's good. Perfect. Very good. You can sit up. What do I do now? Look, you can be the little girl. I read it, and then we act it out like the other d... ...day. - Absolutely. When was my last quiet evening? I go home, feed the children, put them to bed, rent a video, I'll get some celery, and if Antoine calls, I'm at home. No problem! Shermann and Ben can forget me! I can set it to messages only, too. Ben! Carry on, that's perfect! I'll put her on. Sorry. I was... Hello, Ben? It's me, Hortense. - You wanted to ask something? - Yes. Yes. But look, it's rather tricky... Look, call me in 6 months. Can we have a drink? Call me. Just by chance, are you doing anything tonight? No, because the thing I wanted to ask you... - I'm rather embarrassed. - Mrs Aubray's appointment. What is all this? It's not what you think, but... Don't think anything. I'll manage some other way, it's OK. Right. I don't want to force you. Right, then... Where and when? Come to Coco's at 10. Great. I hear it's good. Ten o'clock's perfect. Just a second! I've someone on the other line. - Hello? - It's Shermann. - Shermann! - Did you try to call? Why? Because someone stole my mobile. That's why! Hey, that's a shame! So you didn't get your messages? You don't know who called? Second in 3 months! I haven't had time to call. It's been murder at work! - What about tonight, then? - Tonight? We did say we might see each other tonight. Stay there, I've a call, I'll be right back. OK... Yes, Ben? Excuse me. I haven't much time. Sorry. So about tonight... Can't you make it tomorrow? Nadia, you can... Yes. Because tonight might be... Look, forget it. No, don't forget it. I'll be at Coco's at 10. - I can't stay late. - Me neither. See you later. Hi. - Shermann? - So what shall we do? I'm in a bit of a spot, because tonight... my husband hasn't gone. Silly, isn't it? It doesn't matter. No. But it's silly. Maybe I can manage. Yes... Maybe later in the evening, should I call...? Where? I've no mobile. Forget it, it doesn't matter. I never said it did matter! - Ben, is that you? - No, Antoine. Hortense? Oh! Antoine! Who's Ben? Ben? He's a patient. - Friend of yours, then? - Look... Wait! He's a 12-year-old paraplegic! Please... How do you turn this off? I can't stay on, I've got Mimi on the other side. Look, take care, darling. - Yes... - See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Goodbye, my love. I wanted to tell you I'll get an earlier train. Right. Hello, madam. - Who is seeing to you? - Nobody. My first time. Do you have an appointment? It's just for a shampoo, because this rain... Audrey, could you take Madam's coat? We'll see to you. Come with me. Hello, Liu-Shi Workshop. - Who usually does you? - Nobody, it's my first time. Have you seen anything you like? No, it's just a shampoo for me, because... As you wish. Or just the ends, perhaps. You know what she did? She called Ben. Seeing him tonight. Oh no! Not Ben! There's nothing wrong in spending an evening with a mate! I don't mind Shermann, but not Ben! - You'll come back in pieces! - You see! You know what she asked for? I'll have to lie to her! Lie on your side. - What can I ask a guy for? - A guy? I can't think. That we thought he might redecorate the surgery? Are you mad? We painted it last year! - He's not a painter of walls. - No. But what do you want? What I want... Give me a drag. Is for him to see me, and then think: "How could I do without her? "She has everything. "Beauty, intelligence, charm, a sense of humour... "I'm in love with her and I don't know what to do..." Wake up! My sister's friend asked me to pose as her boyfriend at a party when her ex was there. I ended up sleeping with her. But it wasn't great. So what? I saw her in an ad in Doctor's Weekly. For an insurance company. Or I'll ask for his liver. A transplant. I'll say it's in 3 days. Is that all right? Hortense, I don't understand you. What are you after? You've a wonderful husband, nice colleagues and bearable children. Shit! The babysitter! Evelyne! Did that do you some good? Is your back better? - Yes. - Good. Did you have a good day? - Me? Oh yes. - A little busy, though. - I'll help you. - Oh no... You know, Arnaud and Marco and I had a talk. We were saying we were very happy with you. Thank you. - Really? Are you well? - Yes. Still snug in your little studio? Yes. The neighbours are nice and it's a direct train... Yes, it must be handy. Thank you. Oh, I've a problem... - What is it? - There's a worry about tonight. This dinner that was sprung on me... - With Ben? - Yes. He's totally depressed, I can't let him down. Thanks. So I don't know... I was thinking about it. I don't know if you... - Of course. - Really? - I'd really like that. - You wouldn't mind? I love your children. They feel the same, Evelyne. They love you. I don't want to put you out, because... It's not... Maurice. Don't get angry. I didn't mean to. I should have told you earlier but I was scared you'd shout. Luckily, Gilbert was great. He looked after him like a son. Especially life in a community... it's great but... You have to manage the egos of the whole herd, a herd of 50 goats, new European standards... I never regretted it, but sometimes... - What are you on about? - I called him Ever. he's Pisces ascendant Pisces. He wants to go into television. You still know people at Antenne 2? Very good. Very good! - Your first dye? - Yes! Better in two weeks, when the roots have grown. Very trendy. It's not possible! Can't you at least put it back to brown? You'll look pretty tonight, darling. Don't you think I look a bit old? You reckon? Put this behind the ears. - Yes, that's better. - There. I'll be back. Excuse me. Don't I know you? Sorry? Haven't we met? - I don't think so. - Oh? It's annoying. I'm a physiognomist, but I've no memory. - Do you live in the area? - No. I'm sure I've seen you. Not long ago, either. How were you? Normal: brunette, long hair... Oh, that's a radical change! But it's very pretty. - Maybe at the surgery? - Perhaps. Goodbye. It'll come to me. Goodbye. No! Don't put any lacquer on. No lacquer. That's 695 francs, please. - Do you sell wigs? - No. - What about hats? - No. - Big bobble hats? - No. Do you take lunch vouchers? Hello. Oh, Pierrot! Are you back? Did it go well? I know where I saw that girl! She was taking pictures at your wedding! We had quite a chat. At the hairdresser's. Why? Shall I get her? Did you talk? What about? Nothing. She didn't recognise me. It's weird, though, she must have seen me on the photos. How are they, then? - Who is it? - My sister. What do you mean, all green? How is that possible? What are they doing tonight? No. I'm alone tonight. Am I an easy girl? Easy to live with, you mean? If you weren't my brother, would I be charming or a pain? Is my lack of mystery boring? Would you go for a girl with no mystery? I mean... Has Steph got any mystery? - What are they doing at Christmas? - I don't know. Hortense, you didn't! You didn't call back It's easy for you, life's a bed of roses. Mind you, you always were more stable. Why don't we go to a restaurant. I don't believe you ran into her! - Who? - Who? Can I cash up? I've finished my service. Excuse me. I've a meeting with a stranger for an accident report. It wasn't my fault. Ask the boss, maybe he knows. Dark... In what way? Foreign? Normal? She's not red-haired? What about the clothes? Normal. Thanks. You're a great help. Suburban normal? Old-fashioned? Ordinary? Great! What age? They're all 25! Big, plump... Plump or fat? You can't take the car again. Not the mobile, I don't have it. Yes, see you later. Monsieur... - That must be me. - Pardon? Dark-haired, normal and ordinary. Except for the hair. - You're the "mann" gentleman. - Call me Shermann. Like gentleman. - What's wrong? - The car isn't mine. Bumpers, headlights, bonnet and rear wing. - Oh! - Your car's heavy. - Yes. Can I borrow your mobile? The booth's broken and I've no more credit. I should call my friend about the car. Especially with the train strikes... - How does it work? - Tap in the number and press OK. - Thanks. Are you doing anything tonight? I'm busy tonight. - Who is it? - Nobody. It's not macho, but the right and left aren't integrated. No, it's not macho! No, it's genetic. Are the children well? I don't have any children! You don't want any or you haven't had the chance? What is it now? I was looking at your hat. Could I borrow it just to try for 2 minutes? Thanks. What do you think... With? Without? Put it back on. Without. Without. - Hello. - Hello. A beer, please. The humdrum routine... The humdrum... Thanks. The humdrum... The train or the bus... Dad! Mum! No, Dad will go and fetch you. Don't talk to me like a child! I'm not a child! I bumped the neighbour's car. I'm coming to fetch it. - That's enough! - Tuesday, judo... He's expecting me for dinner and I can't reach him... I wondered if, exceptionally, you... Because I've been fired as well. It's not your fault, but... It's personal problems. I don't want to bother you with that. Stop! I'm very tired. Do you... take lunch vouchers? I beg your pardon. Thank you. Have you booked? It's full. - I'm meeting Ben at 10. - He isn't here yet. Sorry. Bob! Come on! Who are you? Next-door neighbour. You shaved your beard off. What are you doing here? I can't sleep alone at home. Aren't your parents in? No. I think you look better without the beard. You scared me before. You know what Jeanne and I call you? No. Bluebeard? How did you know? We'll move all this and you can go home. But the door's locked and I left my keys inside. Le train-train, le bu-bus. Le train-train, le bu-bus, le bu-bus du cocus. Le train-train pour les cucus! Qu'est-ce qu'on s'en fout, du couscous! A rose, madam? No, thanks. - Please? - Yes. Excuse me! Can I have another? If he'd had a problem, he'd have called. I shouldn't have worn this! It's too tight. It was Coco's, wasn't it? I've a doubt. Service throughout the network is affected. Your attention, please. Following a work to rule by train drivers... Hello, Ben? No, don't cry, pet. It's just a nightmare. No bananas in your bed. No, I can't come. Because I'm with friends. You don't know them. Alice, stop right now. Get a Flamby from the fridge and go back to bed. Lots of kisses, great big kisses. Put Evelyne on. Everything all right? I don't know when I'll be back, but if I'm late... Sorry, two of us! Oh, right. Take care, darling. I'll send you kisses. Wow, isn't he good looking! My God, please make this work! He's handsome! He's... Hi. Hi, Ben. - Just got here. I wasn't sure... - I'm beat. We finished at 6. Pissed as rats. You were at a party? I have to eat. Haven't eaten since yesterday. Work OK? Interesting stuff? What's the important thing you wanted to talk about? - Oh, that... - So what is it? Look... I need some advice on things of the heart. Don't worry. But since it's... it's rather delicate, I hesitated before asking. Anyway, I'll tell you. I had a fling with your friend Shermann. No! You and Shermann? I don't believe it. Do believe it. It's not possible. Shermann's after one thing. I know him backwards. I don't know how it is usually. But this is different. It's not just sexual. Even if that side is extremely good. Anyway, it really is a proper affair. Of course, we're both married. Where are you? I'm eating, I'll call you back. See you later on. Take care. Bye. What's odd is, it's not a power trip thing... It's something based on... mutual respect, trust. An adult relationship. That's what's amusing. Well, anyway... I wanted to tell you. You're friends. I didn't want you to be able... You're eating here? How are you now? You know each other? A little. Very little. Here, darling, I got cigarettes. - Hi, Ben. - Hi. - Shall we go to the Italian? - No, that's silly! No. Why? We'll squeeze up. - Do you mind? - Not at all. On the contrary. Patricia Shermann. - Hortense Lassalle. Hello. - Hello. Sit down. We haven't ordered yet. Haven't we met before? I think so. My brother-in-law's wedding. You took the photos. Are they good? Totally ruined. Oh! Damn! Haven't you changed something? My hair. It's funny. Actually I met your wife. That's amazing. What a coincidence! I was supposed to stay in London. I came back early. Do you have children? Yes, two. With your wife? - Yes. Not very original, but... - But what? Are you happy? Unhappy? Faithful? Unfaithful? Do you still make love? Are your children well balanced? Is it honestly worth reproducing? I don't know. Well, then... Thanks. That's a great help! - I swear he's missed his train. - Of course! That's it! I wanted to leave you a message. It's not my fault you lost your mobile. - Is that your foot I can feel? - What? - Wear stockings or tights? - Stockings. - That gives me a hard-on. - Stop! - What? - Your wife's next door. Meet in the toilets? You go first, I'll follow. Don't be silly! Stop it! - You're going too far. - What? If she feels better... - I'm thinking of Etienne. - Who? She was operated on by the best surgeon, Miller. - Who? - Véro's spaced out. She's what? The bus drivers elected to strike after a new... I'm dead! You can't leave a child alone by locking her in. That's stupid! Not for life. They come back afterwards. - They've done it before? - No. You see! Right, it's time for bed now. I can't sleep in the dark. Where are your children? - I've eaten them. - No you haven't. I have, I swear. Really? I have no children. You must be sad. I don't know. Let's sleep now. OK? - I'm sure you want to. - That's all you think about! Look how we match. Don't you think? I love you! Didn't you love me? You're with Shermann, you're having an affair... Shermann, huh! I threw myself upon him because you didn't want me. You're the one I love. You can't see how I am, you've got this idea of me as the cheating wife and all that... - You don't see me. - I do, Hortense. You're brown-haired, blue-eyed, drunk and a pain. - Grey-green. - What My eyes aren't blue, they're grey-green. Is there any of that left? - You won't get stoned? - You bet I will! Amazing! What a shame! Grey-green. Yoo-hoo! Are you there? You still mean what you said earlier? You want to... - Eh - You believed me? I was joking. In fact I should tell you, it's best that we stop. Affairs like this aren't meant to last. But you were saying you were all for adultery, you thought it was great for marriage. I'm in total agreement. - I said that? - Yes, I assure you. Are you all right? You're all pale. - It's my complexion. - Oh? Shit! What's that? Oh! His mobile! What's it doing here? My husband's mobile. He thought it'd been stolen. He'll be happy! It cost 4000 francs! I could listen to his messages if I wanted. He doesn't know, but I know his code. It's "Marignan". He must have a few in there. He cheats on me. He was supposed to see a woman tonight. I bet the husband came back and there you are! I say that because married women are his thing. It must be simpler. It's all in here. - You don't mind? - Me? I'm not jealous. No. Really I'm not. Although... It's very tempting. What should I do? Listen? We'll give it back to him just to see his two-faced face when he checks his messages. You mind if I borrow it to call my babysitter? Yes... Wait. Can you watch my bag? I'm going to the toilet. Of course. Rely on me. 1664... 1789, 1492... Shit, bloody Marignan! 1418... 1515! Thank you, Séverine. See you later. - Everything OK? - Fine. You don't want any powder? - No. - You're white! You have 9 new messages. Today, 3 pm. Today, 3:05. Today, 3:10. Today, 3:30. You may have lost my number. Here it is again. It's 06... Hang on, shit, I can't remember. Sorry. It's 06 82 22 06 08. Take care. Today, 3:05 pm: One last thing! Sucking Tic Tacs is useless. It doesn't work. Bad breath comes from the liver. Bye. Dial 4 to call back. Help! Help! The train-train, the bu-bus. Hey! Can't you see it's taken? This taxi's taken! Right. Rue Père-Corentin, please! The bus station. I don't believe it. Are you thick? I want to go home. Let me go home. So what? Get out of this taxi and get another! Shit! I'm sick of always being the mug! It doesn't say "mug" on my forehead! I transport people all day. This is private. I've no reason to share it. - Help! Sir, help me! - What with? Don't you think I'm desperate? I'll go. Where do you live? I can drop you. No, I'll take a taxi on the boulevard. There's a bus stop at Alésia. Yes, I know. My brother lives round here. I'm sorry, I... I can't make love like that with just anybody... - What's wrong? - Nothing. I have to walk Didier. - What are you doing here? - I don't know. Come here. I kept his keys, his vitamins, his card... and his jacket. - Whose jacket? - I don't know. Fuck! Lucie? The girl can do it. They're supple at that age. Are you mad? Sorry, I was looking for... It's here. What are you doing here? What about you? What is this? This is mental! That photo trick was childish, but this... Will this last long? Do you want me to divorce? You want us to marry? - And have children? - Exactly. Using my sister in your lousy plans is... - Your sister? - Enough! I know it all. The hairdresser... everything! - Sorry, is that my jacket? - Pardon? Is that my jacket? Oh yes. No, thanks. I'll be going. - You're sure? - Yes. Thank your sister. - She was very kind. - OK. It's OK. He hasn't realised. What's he doing? - Thanks. - Don't mention it. See you. Haven't you changed something? Yes. The beard. Do you have roaches too? You come to my home at 6 o'clock in the morning to annoy me with your sister? You're mad! You half rape me on your wedding day... Because of you, I had to have a traumatic operations... I lose my job, my hair is ruined, and you give me shit about family members! Go and get stuffed! - What time is it? - Go back to sleep, it's early. Rough night, eh? Subtitles - Henry Moon for TELETOTA
