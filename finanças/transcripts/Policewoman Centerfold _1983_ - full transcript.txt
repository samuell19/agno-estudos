Tommy, you get that frogout of here right now. Come here. Get him. Get him. Get Fred and get him out of here. I told you never to bring him into my room. Out. OK, Mom. Can I have some pancakes for breakfast? Tommy, it's a school day. All right. Just put Freddie in his house, OK? All right. Tommy, come on. That's the bus. Let's go. Hustle. Come on. Bye, Mom. Oh, wait a minute. You forgot two things. My lunchbox. Right. And? - Bye, Mom. - You have a good day. Bye-bye. Hey, Jen, wait up. That was a real good ideaof us taking out the arcade. You were right about the drug traffic there. The captain didn't thinkit was such a great idea. That's because it came from you. Jen, he's always going to be on your case. You know that. Yeah, I guess you're right. Come on. Let me buy you lunch. OK. You want one? No, thanks. I thought you quit. I did. When did you start again? Day after Ellen and I got engaged. Ooh, that says something. So I'm a little nervous. Weren't you? Oh, boy, I was terrified. I was 17 and so naive. I didn't know what I was doing or why. Did you love hi? Well, he was the firstguy who ever asked me out. He was the first guy who really liked me. So I married him. Somehow I can't believe that. Well, that's true. Anyway, that was a long time ago. Think you'll ever get married again? Yeah. Yeah, if I meet the right guy. Yeah, Jen, well, there's something I have to talk to you about. Yeah? Unit 210,415 F. Family disturbance at 235 South Valley Drive. That's that nut that was giving and Harris such a hard time. 10-4. We're three minutes from the door. Here we go. Open the door. We're police officers. Leave me alone, please.- Open up. We want to help you. Oh, I can't take this anymore. Oh, thank goodness. Get out of here! It's between me and my wife. What's his name? Bob. OK, Bob, Bob. Bob, listen to me. I know you're feeling bad,but this isn't going to help. Now, your wife and your kids are frightened, and you don't want to scare them. No. Come on, put it down. We'll work this out together, OK? Just put it down. She doesn't understand anything. All she ever says is, did you get a job today? Did you get a job? Why doesn't she understand? Does she know what it's like out there? Why don't you tell me, if you're so smart. Why don't you tell me? OK, I understand. And so does she. OK? She's just worried, that's all. She's just worried about the kids. You don't think I'm worried about them? I know. I know. But you two have to get togetherand work this thing out. Now, if you talk to her, you'llfind out that she understands. Come on, Bob. Just put it down. Honey? Honey, it's going to be OK. All right? I promise. OK? They need some help, you know? It's going to happen again. So why didn't we just arrest the bum? That's not the kind of helpI'm talking about, Chris. Jennifer, can you leave anything up to the social workers? By the time they get around to it? Come on. We gotta go to work. Wait, Jen. There's something I have to talk to you about. Well, can't it wait? Not really. Ellen's gotten a little uptight about us working together so much. That's crazy. She knows me. Can't you talk with her? I guess she's just nervousabout getting married. Do you want me to talk to her? No. No. I don't think that would help. Well, tell her to quit worrying. Jen, look, I'm real sorry. You worry too much. Is everybody decent? Who wants to know? Funny. Yeah, yeah. Come on in. Set up those showers. Oh, Bill. What are you looking at? Oh. Kind of nice, huh? What do you think? Not bad. Don't you think her legs area little large for her body? Lieutenant. Hello. Hello, there. How's my favorite officer? Well, I'm hanging in there. How you've been? I haven't seen you in ages. Well I've been keptpretty busy at the academy. Say, listen, we have a coupleof new young ladies going through training right now. Oh, that's good news. I could use a little more femalecompanionship around here. I'll second that. Officer Oaks. Sir. I'd better be going. Nice seeing you. There's been a request by Officer Sands for a new partner. Request is granted. You'll ride with Officer Velano. That's it. Get to work. Jen, it's just until we get married, and I'm sure she's going to come around. Save it, Chris. I'm sure there are a lot of places you'd ratherbe right now than in this car with a new partner. Women. Excuse me? I don't know who to be angrierat, the dope he's marrying or him. It is kind of a bum rap. Kind of? Well, I'm-- it's nice to meet you. How come I haven't seen you before? Bad luck, I guess. I've seen you. I've heard about you, too. I'll bet. What did you hear? That I was a sex machine or a lesbian? I heard you're a good cop. Oh. Unit 210, 314at the arcade, 3618 South Main. Possible 930. 10-4. We're on our way. Let's go. Take it easy, pal. OK. We'll take it from here. Possession and resisting arrest. This was the guy who was selling at the arcade, huh, gentlemen? Think so. Take this guy in, will you, Stanley? Pretty nice work out there. Thanks. Officer Oaks, you got a minute? Sure. I was wondering, maybe you'dlike to have dinner sometime. Oh, I'm really sorry, butI don't go out with cops, especially my partners. I don't blame you. I don't either. You think maybe there's achance you'd change your mind? I promise I won't wear my uniform. You can pretend. No. Oh, come on, give a guy a break. It's too difficult. It'sjust something I don't do. I don't give up easily. I'm going to keep trying. Good night. I'm going to keep trying. Woo. Oh, yes. Did you see her? Can you imagine having a body like that? I mean, she had beautiful-- Everything. Yeah. No, she didn't. She wasn't that great. Well, you didn't have your glasses on. Look. Long legs, good thighs. Oh, maybe in my next life. I bet she's a rotten person. This is so hot. What's this supposed to do, anyway? Relax you. Well, there's only one thing that relaxes me. Sissy. Oh, that exercise class was torture. I can't believe that'ssupposed to be good for you. Well, if you do it morethan once every six months, it wouldn't hurt so much. Nothing will help my thighs. It's a terminal condition. There's always the police academy. Ooh, that'll get you into shape. I think I'd rather have cellulite. But I don't want to talk about my thighs. I want to talk about you. I thought you said you'dnever go out with the cop. Well, I know. But he was so persistent. Oh. He must really be hot for you. Oh, Sissy, it's been so long since a man's pursued me like this. Makes me so nervous. And he is my partner. You know, I could be making a big mistake. Oh, Jennifer, don't be nervous. It should make you feel great. Besides, it's all right that he's your partner. It just means that you'll see him more. Well, a lot of men think thata woman in a police uniform isn't sexy. Well, then that's all the morereason to go out with this guy. Is he cute? Oh, yes. Oh. Well, is he single? Of course he's single. Does he have any friends? Well, what happened to Jack? I thought you liked him? I do, but Jack just wanteda casual relationship. I just can't do that anymore. I know what you mean. So where is he taking you for dinner? Some Italian restaurant. Jennifer, is he Italian? I don't know. Why? Oh, Jennifer, I hearthey make wonderful lovers. You've heard thatexpression, Italian stallion? Sissy, cut it out. I don't know what's gotten into you today. Oh, I don't know. All this heat or all these bodies, or all this talk about Italians. How about an amaretto? What is it? It's an after dinner drink. Trust me, you'll love it. Larry, two amaretto. Are you Italian? Yeah. Why? I just wondered. I want to ask you aquestion, but I don't want you to take it the wrong way, OK? OK. What is it? Why did you decide to be a cop? Well, I decided I needed to support myself and my son Tommy after my husband left us, and I took a job at Lawson'sfactory, and I hated it. Then one day, I heard the police academy was accepting applications. I just decided to go for it. So how's it been? Hard. I mean, there's tremendous resentment towards because I'm a woman. But you had to knowthere'd be some resistance to a woman on the force. There is another woman. You know Lynn Adams? And I thought it would be difficult, but I wasn't prepared for howintense the feelings would be, or that they would last so long. But do you still like the work? I love it. I never thought I grew up to be a policewoman. I still get a kick out ofit every time I think of it. What did you want to be when you grow up? A movie star. What happened? One day when I was 16, I looked in the mirror and I saw this skinny kidwith braces and no hips staring back at me. And I thought, well, Jen, you better face it. You're not going to be a movie star. What did you want to be? I wanted to be a photographer,and I was for a while. I took aerial photographsfor the Air Force. Do you take pictures now? Oh, yeah, every chance I get. I really-- I really had a nice time tonight. So have I. Even though I pushed you into it? Yeah, even though you pushed me into it. Sometimes it's notjust the way you're playing. Sometimes something happens,something you don't understand. And then you find that everything you thought you'd ever need wasstanding right in front of you. You never once believed that it could be right there, right before your eyes. It could be right there. It could take you by surprise. It could be someone you know the real love. Love could be right before your eyes. This is delicious. I didn't know you could cook. Cops make great cooks, something you neglected to discover until now. I could get used to this. I haven't had a meal cookedfor me since I left home. Yeah I could get used to this, too. You look beautiful. I do? In fact-- What? Check this out. When did you get this? Today. How do I focus it? Right here. OK. OK. What you going to do? Smile. Oh, great. OK, now sit down. Now a little more, youknow, a little more sexier. Sexier? Uh-huh. How's this? Great. OK, now one more. No, no, no. My turn. - No. - My turn. - No. - My turn. No, no, no, no. No, I don't like my picture being taken, no. Hey, this light-- you look great in this light.- I can't do this. You're better at this than I am.- Look over here. Yeah. I think you've had too much wine. Not true. Turn the other way. Turn this way. I feel so silly. That's nice. Give me a little curve there. Do something. How's that? Oh, it's nice. Some shoulder. OK. How's that? All right, now turn around. The other way? More shoulder? Oh, great, great. Great shoulder. Is that your friend? Well, here we go, aboutto begin another boring day. It can't be Kojak every day. Glad I'm riding with you. You didn't say two words yesterday. You had your nose just tuckedaway in that photography book. I was mentally undressing you. What, are you nuts? There, look. Isn't that Sam-- what's his name? You know, he's an officer. I know his wife. And the woman he's with, that ain't her. It's been going on for a month. How do you know that? Locker room talk. I couldn't take that. I wouldn't do that to you. Look what I found. Is this yours? Yes, it is. Do you read it a lot? I've been reading that magazine since I was 15 years old. 15? It has some good articles in it, too. Sure. Do you think this woman posing is a doctor? I doubt it. She wouldn't need the money. Well, maybe she didn't do it for the money. How much do they get paid? I don't know. 10, 15 grand, maybe? That much? Not bad for a day's work, huh? You know, this one'sbody's not in great shape. Look at that I don'tbelieve what I'm hearing. $15,000, huh? These are hot. Do you think so?SISSY: Mm-hmm. You know, nobody's ever taken pictures of good of me before. Sissy, do you think I look sexy? Are you kidding? OK, now, look at this. Good grief. Look at her legs. Her legs? Look at the rest of her. Oh, well, that's abnormal. I mean, nobody looks like that. Do they? She does. You know that they have done issues on women lawyers anddoctors, but they haven't done one on a policewoman. m you wouldn't do that. Would you? You would. Why not? Now, listen. Look at these. I'm not getting any younger. And look at these pictures, Imay never look this good again. You have flipped. Oh, I love it. I showed Sissythe pictures you took of me. You did? Yeah. She wants you to take some of her. Anytime. Nick, do you think I lookas good as some of those women in the magazines? I think you look better. No, come on, now. I really want to know. I'm serious. Why don't you believe me? Well, I don't believe I look like that. I never-- I never thoughtof myself as sexy. Are you kidding? No. I think you're thesexiest, most beautiful woman that I know, no doubt about it. Really, Nick? When I first met you,when you were in uniform-- Yeah. I thought I was going tomake a fool out of myself. You just-- you knocked me out. Pull over. I gotta mail something. Why? There's a mailbox. Just pull over. Sit down. Let me do that. Oh no, Mom, let me help you. You talk to your father. I'll do this. So Jen, finish that storyabout the kid with the knife. Oh, yeah. Well, I screamed at him, and I said, put it down. Put down the knife. I mean it. And he didn't hear me. He didn't move at all. And then Nick tried to sneak up from behind, and I was really afraid thathe was going to come for me. And he did. So I had to pull my gun on him. All right. Did you shoot him? Jennifer, I really don't see why you have to tell these storiesat the Sunday dinner table. Well, Mom, you see, I was trying to tell them how I hardly ever draw my gun. Did you kill him? No, Tommy. I didn't kill him. There's enough violence on television and in the newspapers. We don't need to hear thesestories at the dinner table. Oh, Ma, a little bloodand guts never hurt anyone. That's enough, Skip. Let's have dessert. Well, I got to go. I got a date. It was nice to meet you, Nick. I hope to see you again. - Same here. - Bye, sis. Bye. Don't wait up for me, Mom. Be careful, honey. Betty, is the coffee ready? It's coming. Can I have some cream? Sure. Come on. Why does she do that, Dad? Do what, honey? You know what. She's always putting me down. You're too sensitive. Jen, maybe wasn't the righttime to tell that story. Well, it never seems tobe the right time, does it? Excuse me. I'm going to help him in the kitchen. Look at that. Let's pick her up. I know her. Let me talk to her. Annie, wait! Annie. It's me, Jenny Oaks. I can't believe it. Of all the cops to pick me up, it had to be you. What are you doing out here? What's it look like? Bet he knows what I'm doing. I thought you moved to Chicago. I did. Things didn't work out, so I came back. I just can't believe you're doing this. Oh, come off it, Jen. We always knew I'd end updoing something like this. I mean, really, what elsewould fast Annie be doing? Teaching Sunday school? That's not funny, Annie. There must be something else you can do. You know, for a cop, you're pretty naive. And jobs don't grow on trees these days. I still can't believe you're a cop. You used to be afraid ofyour own shadow growing up. Didn't keep me out of trouble, though. That's for sure. You got me in so much troublemy mother tried to stop me from hanging around with you. I'm just trying to help, Annie. I don't want to see them bring you in. They gotta catch me first. Getting old. But we never thought that would happen to me. Nope. How's the kid? Must be huge. He's big. Listen, lady, I gotta get back to work. Now, you get off the streets, OK? See you later, Jen. Take care. You too. And thank you. You were friends? Yeah. We used to read moviemagazines and smoke cigarettes together down by the reservoir. We were always in trouble. Hi, Mom. Hi, baby. Mom? Ah! Help! A monster! And I'm going to get you. And when I get you, I'm going to.. Come here. You come here and let me tell you. Come here, you little devil. Come here. Come here. I'm going to put green all over your face. Come here. I'm going to make you green like me. Get off, Now, you stay therebecause I'm going to come back, and I'm going to get you. All right? Yeah. Hello? Jennifer Oaks, please. Yeah this is Jennifer. Hi, I'm Margo Syms. Who? From "Centerfold Magazine." Oh, come on. Is this a friend of Sissy's? No, this is not a joke. I promise. My name is Margo Syms, andI'm the talent coordinator for "Centerfold Magazine." We received your letter and your photos, and we're very interestedin your suggestion for a policewoman pictorial. I didn't-- I didn't think somebody was going to call me. Actually, it's a great angle. Here's what we'd like to do. We'd like to bring you outhere to Los Angeles for a test. There is no obligation whatsoever. We'll pay for everything. We'll show you around LA and take a few photos. We'll see how they turn out,and we'll take it from there Well, how long will it take? Oh, just a couple of days. And we're prepared to pay you $25,000 for the layout in the event that we all decide to go ahead with this. How does that sound to you? Well, it sounds great. I'll just have to think about it, though. OK? Oh, that's fine with us. You take your time, and youget back to us when you can. I will. Yeah. Great. Terrific. I'll talk to you soon. Yeah, goodbye. So anyway, that's what I did. You did what? I mailed the photographs youtook of me to "Centerfold." They called me this morning. They want me to come to Los Angeles for a test. You mailed those photosto "Centerfold Magazine?" Yeah. I did it for fun, you know. I don't know what really came over me. You know, nothing's going to come of it. That's convenient. I didn't think they'd call me, Nick. You know I've never done anything like this in my whole life. Well, what you going to do? Go. You're going to go? Yeah. Why not? I mean, I've never been to California. I've never been anywhere. And you know as soon as I go out there, they'll just take one look at me and they'll forget the whole thing. Why do you keep saying that? What are you trying to prove? I'm not trying to prove anything. It's just a magazine. You read it, my brother reads it. Every cop on the force reads it. And that's the point. I don't want you to pose nude, Jenny. There's nothing wrong with that. And they're going to do it in good taste. Good taste. We're not talking about good taste. We're talking about you andme, not the rest of the world. Look, I know what I'm doing, OK? Yeah, well, explain it to me. Well, I can't explain it to you. But it's important for me to do this. I know that. It's something I have to do. Listen, things like this havea way of getting out of hand. That won't happen. Jen-- forget it. Forget it. You do what you want. Nick? Come on. Let me talk to you. Come on. FranceAllied flight 291 leaving now-- I don't know about this. I feel like I could pass out any second. Getting cold feet? Oh, yes. Honey, why don't you go in my place? All right, I'm ready. Give me your ticket. I wish you could. I am so scared. I figure once they see me, they'll figure they made a bad mistake. Now, look, they said there was no obligation. Besides, you look great. They're going to love you. Oh, do I? I mean, do I look like a hick from the sticks? Well, yes. Oh, now, don't worry. You look great. They're going to love you. You're going to miss your plane. OK. Tommy, I want you to be good for Sissy, now. OK? OK, but don't forget a present for me. Oh, won't, honey. All right. Here. Take that. Sir? Oh, Jen, do me a favor. Bring me back an Italian aboutsix feet tall, great bod. - Oh, I'll try my best. - OK. I love you. Love you too. Have fun. I will. I will. Bye-bye. - Bye, now. Tommy, you be good, now. - Bye, Mommy. - Bye. - I love you. - Love you, too. You look great. You look good. Good? - You look great. - All right. - All right. - Bye. Bye, now. Bye, Mom. There are feelingsthat just won't be denied. In time, you can't say no. You're helpless. You can't explain yourself. Before you know yourself, you let go. And this is one of those times,no chance of slowing it down. Just one more smile and I'm on my way. How lucky can I be? No matter how it may seem to you, this time I'm going to see it through. This one's for me. There are voices that tell us what to do, and dreams that never die. When the time comes, don'tleave them on the shelf. You won't forgiveyourself if you don't try. And this is one of those times,no chance of slowing it down. Just one more smile and I'm on my way. How lucky can I be? No matter how it may seem to you, this time I'm going to see it through. This one's for me. Coming. Hello. I'm Margo Syms. We spoke on the phone. This is our photographer,Todd Walker. Nice to meet you both. How was your flight? Fine. Thank you. You're even prettier than your pictures. And you're so young. Why? Did I sound old on the phone? Yes. That was my serious business voice. Now, I have somecontracts for you to sign. I'm going to leave them with youso that you can look them over. And if you have anyquestions, you just call. Remember, you have complete approval of the pictures before we run them, and there'sabsolutely no obligation for you to go through withthe running of the pictures if you decide not to. I'll pick you uptomorrow morning at 9:00. Anything else? Oh, Todd will describe the shoot to you. I wanted to have lunch withyou today, but I just couldn't. Something came up. But Todd is not only a brilliant photographer, he's also a very nice man. So I know you're in good hands. Any questions? I don't think so. Tomorrow's shoot will be easy. It's not nearly as scary as it seems. Meanwhile, you relax and have some fun today. Bye, Margo. Have you seen much of LA yet? No. Would you like to take a shorttour, then get a bite to eat? I'd love it. Good. Is this your first trip to LA? Yeah, it's the first timeI've been this far west ever. This is delicious. I come here all the time. It's always good. You're going to look great on film. How do you know? I've been doing this a long time. I know these things. The coloring, the way thelight looks on your face. You know, I don't know ifI'm doing the right thing. What bothers you about it? Well, I'm worried about what people think. You know, I come from a smalltown, and I have a little boy. And I am a police officer. I know all that. But what it comes down to is, how do you feel about your body? Why do you ask that? Do you like the way you look? Well, no. No, not really. Then you're doing the right thing. Why? Because this experience will make you feel great about how you look and how you feel about your body. I've seen it happen time and time again. Oh, I hope you're right. Todd, isn't that Vince Ferragamo? Vince? You know him? Ah. Hi. How have you been? Fine, fine. How come every time I see you,you're with a beautiful woman?

Hey, it's not LA, butit's not that bad, either. Yeah. I guess you're right. I just had a really hard day, that's all. I love you. I love you, too. Are you sure you've got to go? Jennifer, you look incredible. Can they do this for anyone? They did it for me. Now, listen. Dear Jennifer, we love the photos. We'd like to run them in the next issue. Please call me so we can discuss this further. You look fabulous. I look forward to talkingwith you, da-da-da. Sincerely, Margo Syms. Oh, they want them. Yes. Oh, well, I don't blame them. You look just beautiful. Oh, Sissy, I can't believe it's me. Oh, well, it's definitely you. Sure, there's your birthmark. It's amazing how that made me look, huh? I'll say. What a body Oh. What? Well, this one's a littlerevealing, don't you think? Well, there. Hey, has Nick seen these yet? Ooh, yeah. You should've seen his face. Oh, I wish I could have. No, you don't. Gee, Jen, what about your job? I mean, this could be big trouble. Sissy, what can they do? Well, they could make yourlife miserable, for one. They can't really do anything. I haven't broken any rules or regulations. Doesn't forgetting to wear your uniform break some kind of regulation? Very funny. These sure are sexy. Come on, Sissy. You've seen photographs like this before. Not of my best friend, thank you very much. I'm still the same person. Well, I guess so. Only now, it's just a little bit more of you. Nick? Nick, I want to get this stuff cleared up. I do. I don't want to talk about it now, OK. OK. When? Because every time I wantto talk to you about it, you say it's the wrong placeor it's the wrong time. Now, Nick. Come here. I told you. I think that too revealing. And I don't think they should be printed. And I think that you'll be sorry if they are. I'll be sorry? Hey, it's your body, not mine. Yeah, you're right. Whatever you do, you betterget Buckman's permission first. You know what I don't understand? I don't understand why yourattitude on this whole thing has changed so much. Hey, my attitude hasn't changed at all. It's been your decision all along. But I want your support. I don't know if I can give it to you, Jen. I just don't feel right about it. I'm sorry. No, I'm addressing the PTA that night. Yes, Sunday will be fine. Take care of this. What's on your mind, officer? I have a request, sir. Come on. I don't have all day. I've been offered-- um, well, a magazine wantsto do a story on me, sort of, and they've taken some pictures of me. What kind of pictures? They're for "Centerfold Magazine." What? You're kidding, right? I'm not kidding, and I would like permission to let them publishthe pictures in the next issue. Well, you got a lot of nerve. I don't know what you mean. You know exactly what I mean. You're one of two women ona police force of 160 men. You're damn lucky to be here at all. And you think that I'mgoing to give you permission to pose nude in a girlie magazine and continue to representthis police force? Absolutely not. You never liked me. You never wanted me on this force, and you've never acceptedthat I can do the job. Well, you'll never proveyourself to me this way. I have already proven myself. I am a good officer. What kind of a woman are you, anyway? I earned the right to be on this force, and I intend to stay on it. The thing that really bugs you is that you don't have anything on me. Compared to half the officers on this force, I'm a dream cop, sir. Margo? Yeah, it's Jennifer. I want to do it. Yes. No, they can't do anything to me. I haven't done anything wrong. Thank you. Bye. So I wanted you tohear this from me and not from some kid at school. What's the big deal? Well, these pictures aregoing to be in a magazine that a lot of people can see. And some people think I was wrong to do this. What kind of pictures are they? Can I see them? Well, they're really fun, you know? I mean, they're nice. But they're for grown-ups to look at. When can I see them? When you're older. How old do I have to be? Older, like Skip's age. Mom, that's forever. Well, that's the way it is. Now, come on. Finish your soda. Come on. I've got to take you to Sissy's because I gotta get back to work. OK. It's good to have you back, kid. Well, if Michaels hadn't been sick, I wouldn't have been assigned to you. Oh, you're twice the cop he is. So you think you made the right decision? Well as soon as Buckman said those things to me, that was it, you know? I knew exactly what I wanted to do. He made me so angry. But if that hadn't happened with him, would you have made the same decision? Oh, yeah. If you wanted to now, could you stop it? Why? I've been thinking. Something like thisaffects a lot of people-- your parents, Tommy, me. And you'd also be jeopardizing your job. I don't know if it's worth the money. Nick, I didn't do it for the money. I did it for me. Unit 219,415 F, family disturbance. 235 South Valley Drive. I know who that is. Come on, let's go. Jennifer, is that you? Lou, hi. Hi. Can I-- can I help you with something? Yeah. I'd like to buy a "Centerfold." You mean you didn't get one free? Yeah, but I want another one. They're right here. Oh, great. Oh, it's on me. Thanks. You look great in there. You really do. Oh, Lou, thank you. Yeah Well, bye-bye. Bye. Bye. All right, knock it off. Knock it off in here. Nip and Billings, I want you to take out that bar on 13th street. Watch who comes and goes. Get a feel for its busiest hours. It may be the next place hit. All right, the Departmentis taking up a collection for Officer Potter's widow. Donations can be left with Officer Gallo. Oaks, you're assigned to deskduty until further notice. All right, that covers it. Let's go to work. How's it going, Jen? It's been better. Eh, don't let them get to you. You don't see them pass up the magazine, do you? No. Coffee? Yeah, and I'd like a bowl of soup. You don't want the soup. I'll get you a nice sandwich. Can I sit down? Is Ellen watching? Look, Jen, I just want to warn you. What? All the wives got apetition together to kick me off the force? Hey, I'm trying to help you. Buckman's out to get you, and a lot of guys are just adding fuel to his fire. I'll just bet. I just want to let you know I'm behind you. Isn't it a little late? Look, I appreciate it, OK? I'll see you later, Jen. - Knock, knock. - Skip. - Hi. - Hi, honey. What brings you around here? Oh, just felt like a visit. - Yeah? - Got any food? Of course. There's some leftover chicken in the fridge. Oh, great. You know where everything is. Yep. So who's winning the war? Oh, it's awful. It's just getting worse and worse. How do Mom and Dad feel about it? Well, you know Dad. Says about three words every five days, so he really hasn't had much to say about it. And Mom, it just gives hersomething else to worry about. That sounds like her. She had a pretty roughtime on her bridge game the other night. Oh, no. You know, you're just goingto have to take all the flak. I mean, there's nothingelse you can do about it. You're tough. You can handle it. What do you think? I think it was apretty crazy thing to do. But I also think you look great. It doesn't embarrass you, then? Oh, no. Some of the guys ribbed meabout it a little bit, but, hey, it's not every day yoursister's in "Centerfold." Nick, hi. How're you doing? Hi, Nick. Skip. Excuse me. Hello? Todd, hi. How are you? Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah, I'm OK. Well, yeah, they're pretty upset. No. Oh, I wish I could, yeah. But it's a little fast out here for me. Yeah, I'm sure. Well, listen, thank you so much for calling. I appreciate it. Yeah. I will. Bye-bye. That was the photographerwho had taken my pictures. That's great. What, does he have another job for you where you take your clothes off? What's wrong, Nick? Jen, I gotta go. Mom's got dinner waiting for me.- Yeah. Bye, Skip. - I'll see you. - Mm-hmm. - Bye, Nick. See you, Skip. Did something happen today? Of course something happened today. You know, it's not just the cops, and they're having the timeof their lives with this. It's the people on the streets, in the stores, the tellers at the bank, everywhere. I'm sorry. OK? Yeah, well, sorry doesn't make it. Why didn't you think about this? I tried to warn you, didn't I? Yes, you did. We have no privacy anymore. I feel invaded, like our sex life is out on the newsstand or something. Oh, that's not true. Now, come on. Are you that embarrassed? Yes. People look at me funny,like I did something wrong. I don't know if I can handle this, Jen. I want to be able to, butI just don't know any more. I'm just going to have to takesome time and think about it. Nick, is there anything that I can do? No. I'll be in touch. Come in. You wanted to see me, sir? Sit down. Officer Oaks, I've asked fora formal board of inquiry into your recent behavior. As of today, you're suspended indefinitely from this police force. On what grounds? Conduct unbecoming anofficer, among other things. What? Conduct unbecoming an officer? That's right. And if I have anything to say about it, you'll never wear anotherpolice uniform again. Now, give me your gun and your badge. There-- there areofficers on this force who openly cheat on their wives. I know and you all know officers who pick up prostitutes, and not for arrest. And you call what I've doneconduct unbecoming an officer? These men have hurt other people, and I haven't hurt anybody. What I did I did on my own time,and it only has to do with me. Am I excused now? Yes, you are. Come on. Unbecoming behavior. Coming from those guys, that's a joke. I can't believe it's gone this far. I don't know why you're so surprised. What do you mean? Jennifer, you posed nudein a national magazine. You're a police officer ina small conservative town. What did you expect? I didn't expect for them tothreaten to take away my job. Look, Jennifer, we'renot in high school anymore. It's not like you're going to be kicked off the cheerleading team. Well, I know that, Sissy. You might be kicked off the police force. I just don't think you'rebeing realistic about this. Thanks for all your support. I'll see you later. I'm really-- Did you see the morning papers? I'm sorry, Mom. You go ahead. No, you go. I-- I'm really sorry about allof this hurting you, you know. I really am. But there's nothing I can do. I feel awful. Do you know that? Oh, baby, you're beautiful. God gave you a beautiful body, and you have nothing to be ashamed of. Don't look back. You just have to go on from here. Fight them. I've never known you not to fight back. I think this time a little too far. Nonsense. They just want you to give up. Don't you do that. Oh, Mom. Oh, Mom. There's the kid. Yep. Great. Look at this. Mommy. What do you think you're doing, hm? Hm? Hey. Hey! Come here. Come here. Just put that change up there, will you? Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, come back here. Let's get him. Let's get him. Don't let him get away. Hey, come out here. Wait a minute. Wait up! Tommy, where are you, honey? Tommy? Tommy? Tommy. Tommy, who did this to you? Huh? Tell me who did this to you. Some big kids from junior high. Oh, baby. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Here we go. Did you have a nice bath? Uh-huh. Well, we'll have some dinner,and then after that I brought some ice cream for dessert. I'm not hungry, Mom. Tommy? Oh, Tommy. You didn't do anything wrong. You know, it was OK foryou to get in that fight. I just wish you hadn't been putin a position of defending me. I didn't into a fight, Mom. They beat me up. Why did you have to do it? Because-- because I wanted to. Why? Honey, sometimes we do thingsfor reasons that only make sense to us, you know, and they don't make sense to other people. But we just go ahead and we do them anyway. Can you understand that? I don't know. When you grow older, there's going to come a time when you do something that I'm not going to agree with. And I just hope that I can understand that the decision you madewas the right one for you. I should have shown you the pictures. Now, that was a mistake. Oh, honey. I am so sorry that all this has happened. You know I wouldn't do anythingin the world to hurt you. You know that, don't you? Yeah. Well, don't you ever forgetit because I love you very much. I love you too, Mom. What are you going to be if youcan't be a policeman anymore? I don't know. What do you think I should be? A fireman. Well, I think I'd have a little trouble getting that job. Mom? Yeah? I thought your pictures looked pretty. Oh, Tommy. Thank you. Now, come on. Let's have some dinner sowe can have some ice cream. OK? Ketchup? Some mustard, too? Yeah. Well, I'll certainlydo the best I can for you. Right now I'm waiting to hear if the city manager will hear your case. As long as the Internal Affairsdivision has the case alone, you don't stand asnowball's chance in hell. I mean, they really want your hide. They're not only sayingconduct unbecoming an officer. Now they're saying somethingabout laws on the books, not being able to take another job without good reason, and without having writtenpermission from the captain, which you didn't get. When will we hear if the city manager is going to hear the case? Hard to tell. Week, two, maybe three. Part of the problem isthis whole thing has caused quite a stir in the community. Everybody's taking sides, speaking out. It's raising all kinds ofissues-- sexism, women's rights, hypocrisy, you name it. Some of that is good for us. But I'd keep a low profile if I were you, at least until we knowbetter what we're up against. OK. Listen, I want you to remember one thing. You haven't done anything wrong. Thank you for your help. Don't thank me yet. In the meantime, let's just hope for the best, and I'll be in touch. Thank you. They're going to nail here. What do they got her on? You name it. Moral misconduct,insubordination, improper dress, whole list of things. Is that enough to be dismissed? It is if they want it to be. I heard she really lost itwhen they suspended her. Serves the broad right. Who the hell does she think she is, anyway? I thought she looked pretty good. I wouldn't mind a little of that action. Hey, hey. You better keep your foul mouth shut, or I'm gonna break your head. You get my drift? All right. I don't want to hear anotherword from any of you guys. OK, OK. Larry. The controversy surroundingthe indefinite suspension of officer Jennifer Oaksfor posing in this month's "Centerfold Magazine" widened today when Captain David Buckman announced he was asking a permanentdismissal of Miss Oaks from the Labor police force. An internal board of inquiryhas been called to review all sides of this unusual case. In other news, the presidentmade a quick stop in-- Nick! Hey. How you doing? OK. When are you going to comeand play ball with me? Soon. - Tommy, your bus is here.- Go ahead. See you later, Nick. See you later. Bye, Mom. Bye, honey. Hey. I need to talk to you. Why? I feel terrible. I feel like an idiot, leaving you like that. I'm sorry. Nick, please, I don't-- Look, just let me finish. I've been walking around thelast two weeks like a zombie. All I've been thinkingabout is you, you and me. And that's all that matters is you and me. I love you. And I want to marry you. Nick, you have terrible timing. I mean, look at my hair, and I'm dressed in-- Hey. Would you marry me, please? I've wanted you to ask me thatquestion since I first met you. And now, you know this is reallya tough time for me right now. And I've got to sort some things out. You know, I have to get my job back. That's very important to me. And I can't marry you right now, when I'm going through all this. I don't think it's fair. Can you wait? I can wait as long as it takes. Aren't you the girl thatposed in "Centerfold?" Yeah. Well, look, we think whatyou did is fine, just fine. We really do. Thank you. Well, I really hope you get your job back. They had no right to fire you. I hope I get it back, too. Well, bye now. Bye. And good luck. Thank you. I saw another one of those billboards today. Yeah, me too. How are my chances looking this week? Oh, Nick. I'm still feeling so frustrated. Not so good, huh? I feel like I'm in limbo. I feel like if I don't get my job back, I'm going to have to look for something else. And you don't want a wifewithout a job, do you? I want you any way I can get you. I love you. I promise it'll be soon. Yes, well, we're still trying to get the city to rule on your case. First amendment rights violation is the way it's being presented. How long is it going to take? I'mbringing the case up tomorrow. Right now the chances are 50/50of you getting your job back. OK, I understand. Look, Jen, I'm trying my best. Just keep your fingers crossed. Bye. Thanks, Steve. Bye. Come here. Let me make sure your hair is OK. You be good. - OK. OK. Goodbye. Bye, Mommy. Bye, Tommy. If thatdiamond ring turns brass, Daddy's gonna buy you a looking glass. Hi, Chris. Hi. What are you doing here? Orders. Jen, I have to give you this. Oh, Chris, I don't believe it. It could be rightthere, right before your eyes. It could be right there, itcould take you by surprise. It could be someone you never really liked. Love could be right before-- Look for that open door, Love could be right before your eyes.
