(whistle tweeting) (tense music) (engine revving) (engine revving) (crowd chattering) (crowd chattering) (crowd chattering) - Hi, my name's Tim. Tim Hughes, this is my school. Roosevelt High School. It looks like your basic All American high school right? Well, in a lot of ways it is. We're really good in sports. We won the state football championship for the last four years, and last fall, we took conference in soccer. Our cheerleaders are (laughing) aw, you know what I mean. Strange thing happened to this school last year, but I guess, to tell you the whole story, I gotta go back to when it all started. (calm music) - Hi. - Yeah, can I help you? - Yeah, toasted almond please. - Sure, hold on. - I betcha that thing's fulla ice cream. - Yeah, I could sure go for a bite or two. (laughing) (door thudding) - Here he comes. - He's leaving. He's leaving. (footsteps crunching) This is gonna be a piece of cake. - [Tim] You sure you know how to run one of these things? - [Marty] Yeah, I watch him all the time. (laughing) - Alright, let's go. - Alright. (thrilling music) - Let's go, let's go. - Where are the keys? The keys, man. - It won't start, it's not turning, man. Something's wrong. - Hey, the dude's coming, man. - Gimme some money, gimme some money, quick, hurry up. Gimme some money. - Yeah, yeah, you need something? - Yes, I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what the General Death Star consists of? - Uh, pineapple, water, sugar. It's great in the summertime. - Alright, I'll have one of those then. - Okay, fantastic. Whoops, excuse me. (laughing) (packages crinkling) Here you go, I want you to enjoy it. - Yeah, how much is that? - It's 65 cents. - There you go, oh! (engine revving) Let's go, let's go! - That's my truck! (tense music) - Whoo! (engine revving) (bell ringing) (engine revving) (bell ringing) (engine revving) (bell ringing) (engine revving) (engine revving) (crowd chattering) (engine revving) (bell ringing) - Free ice cream, everybody! (crowd chattering) Free ice cream everybody. Okay, okay. - Oh yes! (crowd chattering) - Okay, there you go. (crowd chattering) Alright. (crowd chattering) (tense music) (police car sirens) - Put your hands on the truck, let's go! Hands on the truck! Hands on the truck. - I can't understand why you're so hung up about obscene language in school library books. Some of those books are best sellers. - You know, feminists in Illinois, won't even allow the word "lady" to be used in a sixth grade reader. Now, isn't that hung up? - They just object to the traditional role that mom cleans the stove, or the baby's diapers, that's all. - It's okay to show Dad changing the baby's diapers, no problem. - We're going to a commercial any time now. - Thank you very much, pastor. We'll be right back-- - Keep going, keep going, keep going. - After this commercial message. - Coming up in the next half hour of the Sid Hughes show, it's dieting and ESP. Finding yourself through your next divorce, and meet a group of toddlers who found fulfillment by going on strike against their parents. - That guy made me look like a chump. Have the next guest get ready. - Call on line five four. - Hello. - Down at the police station. - Meg, what are you doing down at the police station? Did you pay your ticket? (tense music) - But a Christian camp might be just the thing for him to turn him around. Look at the brochure, Sid. It's a perfectly good program. A full waterfront program, horseback riding, team sports-- - I don't care if they have hang gliding and deep sea fishing. I'm warning you, Meg, if you send Tim to a camp like that he'll come back a born again Bible banger. (calm music) - A camp? What kind of camp? - I don't know (laughing). It's just, you know, camp. - Come on, what kind of camp? - I don't know the name of it. It's in Wisconsin. - What's the story? (water splashing) - Alright, (laughing) my folks are sending me to this religious camp 'cause they think it's gonna shape up my behavior. And there were some nice looking girls on the brochure. (bait splashing) - Man, I can see it now. Front page of the National Enquirer, Sid Hughes' son attends Christian summer camp. (fun music) (chattering) - I don't know any churches at all. See, my parents aren't Christians, and I've never really been to church. (hopeful music) - It's been so quiet this past week. - Yeah I know. - What if he comes back-- - Comes back what? - Well, you know, religious. (laughing) - Come on. (engine revving) - You put on some weight, Timmy. Look Sid. - He's smiling about something. - Maybe he's got a girlfriend. (chuckling) - Probably doesn't want to talk about it. - Mom, Dad, I gotta tell you about the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. - Mmm-hmm, what's her name? - Find out what he has to say, dear. (laughing) - Hey I'm not stopping him. - Well, I learned how the Bible says we're like sheep gone astray. - Oh, hey, that reminds me. We got the wool blankets you liked. On sale at Pardon's, you know, the plaid ones. - And the matching drapes, and your favorite notebook paper. I know how you like the big lines on it. - Thanks, well anyway-- - Well go on. - Go ahead, Timmy. - What I'm trying to say is that I've decided to become a Christian. - Uh, wait a minute, say that again. - I've decided to become a Christian. - That's very interesting, Timmy. Thank you for sharing that with us. - You did no such thing. - Are you disappointed, Dad? - Oh, look, Sid, there's McDonalds. We could all stop for Chicken McNuggets! - I paid $600 to send my kid up to a summer camp so he can come back some religious nut. - I'm sure he did other things too dear. I can remember summer camp. Swimming, boating, maybe he made some moccasins. - I just don't get it. - Well maybe he's just expressing some emotional feelings in a religious gatherings, and singing out loud. - You just don't make a big decision like this-- - Mom, it wasn't an emotional thing. It's real. - Oh, Tim, I'm sure what you're saying is very sincere. Oh, Marty called, he's got a new car. (fun music) - How was camp? - It was really good. - So how were the girls? - They were really nice. - That is cool. (drink splashing) (drink splashing) (drink splashing) What are you doing? - Nothing, man, I just got air in there. I don't know, Marty. This stuff tastes terrible. - You ain't even tasted it yet. (engine revving) (crowd chattering) (bell ringing) (crowd chattering) (kids applauding) - How you doing Marty? - Not bad, not bad. (crowd chattering) - That's Mrs. Buell, spelled B u e l l. (laughing) - B, e, u, e, l, l. (laughing) - Alright, class. (laughing) - Max, you been a bad boy again. (crowd chattering) - I didn't do anything. (crowd chattering) Ha, ha. (crowd chattering) - I want you to write about what is the most important thing in the world to you. - Girls. - [Tim] This writing assignment, greatest thing in the world to me. I knew I had to put things on the line. Either I'd speak up, or I'd have to lie. This undercover stuff would have to come to an end. (ball thumping) (tense music) (wheels crunching) - Hey, man, how's it going? - Hey, what's up? - Check it out, man. Thought I'd just stop by and let you know. I'm running for class president. - Party with Marty, school demagogue promises big reforms. - Yay. - What are you gonna promise this year? Driving privileges for freshmen? - No, no, I'm gonna go with a completely different approach. The fact is, deep down inside, everybody in school wants is a good time. (chuckling) - Who's gonna fight against that? - Well, there's William McCallister the Third, school spirit and all that rot. He ain't got a chance. We're gonna blow his doors off. Me and you, alright? - Yeah, alright. - Alright, listen. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning, 7:15. We'll do some campaigning around school, alright? - Alright, see you later. - And I think that calling attention to the fact that the overwhelming majority of the people favored prayer being permitted in schools was a logical thing to say to the members of Congress when I was trying to get-- - When politicians start talking about religion then I have had it. - [Reagan] Been restored. (paper crinkling) (TV chattering) (TV chattering) (TV chattering) (phone ringing) - [Girl] Hello? - Hello, may I speak to Becky Olsen please? - This is Becky. - Hi, my name is Tim. - Tim Cameron? - No. - Tim Ellow? - My name is Tim Hughes, and (laughing) you don't know me, but-- - Didn't you use to hang around with Marty Sullivan last summer? - Yeah. - Oh yeah, I thought so. - Well, listen, I went to Cedar Ridge last summer, and they said that you might be able to tell me about. About a Christian group that I could get in with. - Oh, our youth group. Hey, listen, why don't you meet me in front of the school tomorrow, and I'll introduce you to some of the kids. - Yeah, okay, that'd be great. Alright, thanks a lot. (calm music) - How are your fish doing? - Well, no babies yet. - You, you met a new friend? The person you were just talking to. - It's the girl I was supposed to get in touch with after camp. - I see. Is that a Bible? - This? Yeah. - You're bringing it to school? - Yeah. - Pretty brave move. You think anybody's going to see you with it? - I'm putting it in this. - Okay. Can I get you anything? - You're worried about me aren't you? - What are moms for? - You don't have to worry, Mom. Everything's alright. I'm still me, I'm still Tim. - Okay. - You just don't understand, do you? - I'm trying. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Mom. * Do you see, do you see (engine revving) * All the people slinking down? * No-one aches, no-one hurts (door thudding) * No-one even sheds one tear * When He cries, He weeps, He bleeds * And He cares for you (doorbell ringing) - Marty, hi, come on in! - Tim'll be right down. - Tim! Hurry up, Marty's here! - Um, Mom, can you tell Marty just to go ahead? I'm running a little late. - Probably just woke up, the clown. - Probably. - Hey, Marty! Missed you this summer. Stop by for a beer sometime why don't you? - Sidney. - To celebrate, when I get elected class president. - [Sid] Hey, it's in the bag. Mr. Popularity. - I'm sorry you had to come out of your way. - Don't worry about it. I'll catch him in school later on, okay? I'll see you later, okay. - Goodbye. * He left him out on the streets (crowd chattering) * Open up, open up * give yourself away * You see the need * You hear the cries * So how can you delay? * God's calling, and you're the one - Wow! You bring this to school? - Can I have that back? - You've got a lot of guts. * Oh, Jesus rose from the dead (whistle tweeting) * Come on get out of your bed (cheering) - Hey Tim what's going on man? - What are you guys doing? - What you want man? - Hey hop in. Hey, c'mon, man, get in. - I gotta do something. - C'mon in man. - [Tim] I didn't believe in what Marty stood for anymore, but what do you do with your non-Christian best friend once you become a Christian? Are you still his friend but you just don't hang around him anymore or what? I was very confused that day. But I'd soon meet a girl who'd give me a most unusual answer to that question. (lighthearted music) (whistle blowing) - You gotta be Becky, right? - Hi, Tim. You know, you look like Scott Baio. - Hey, babe, how's it going? - Ted! I'm trying to find some kids in our youth group so you can meet them. - Thanks. - Hi, Becky, how's it going? - Hi, Jenny. Hey, what'd you get on your Chemistry test? - B- what did you get? - Um, it's a secret. (laughing) - See you later. - Bye. - It's been kinda tough for me to change the kids that I hang around with. - Yeah, well, you just gotta play games with them, like don't look at 'em. Pretty soon they get the message, and bug off. - Hi, Becky. - Oh, hey Laura. Are you and Scott back together yet? - No, but Bruce Myers just made a pass at me. - Oh wow, hey keep me posted. You'll like our youth group. We get lots of basketball players, football players, cheerleaders, you name it. So are you gonna come? - Yeah, sounds great. Do you have many activities? - Activities? We've got one set of youth group on Wednesdays. Crusaders on Thursday, Friday Night Special on Friday, Seekers plus sometimes a special activity on Saturdays. We've got Sunday youth group on Sundays, plus regular church on Sunday morning, plus young people's church on Sunday night. We've got Volleyball on Monday, and choir practice on Tuesday. - Wow, sounds like you guys are pretty spiritual. - Sure are. - I really wanna start getting into the Bible. - Well, we do that too. - Hi, Becky. - Hi, Becky. - Hi there. - Are you going to car wash Saturday? - No, Dennis, I'm going sledding. - Bye! - They part of the group? - Yeah, but they're not who I'm trying to find. There there are. Hey the gang has arrived! Hi guys, how are you? This is Tim. - Hi. - He used to hang around with Marty Sullivan, but he got saved last summer, and now he's looking for some new friends. (crowd chattering) - Your dad's a secular humanist on TV right? - Yeah. - Sid Hughes is your dad? Oh my gosh, I don't believe it. The Sid Hughes? - Yeah, where have you been? (laughing) - Saw your dad last Thursday, cutting down this lady who wouldn't pull the plug on her 86 year old father. - This is Bill, our next class president. - I'm not so sure. - Oh you're just being modest. All ready for the big speech work period? - Not really, I have to miss Calculus. - Oh, bother. - You're hilarious, you know that? (laughing) - C'mon, Tim, you can walk me to the gym. - Nice meeting you guys. (crowd chattering) - If I'm elected as your next class president, my administration will bring to this school a new era of good times. (audience cheering) (audience applauding) Also, also from now on, the speed limit in the student parking lot's gonna be 35, man. (audience cheering) (audience applauding) I promise to end the dress code. - What a total jerk, I can't believe it. - Except for you preppies. You can still wear your Izod shirts, and Topsetters, or whatever you wear. (audience laughing) Finally, in spite of the good looking girls, and the extra curricular activities here at Roosevelt, face it. School's boring! - Did you hear what he did last summer? - No, what's that? - He went down to Miami, to buy all these drugs, to sell to the grade school kids. - So, remember, when you go to the polls today, party rhymes with Marty. So, vote for Marty Sullivan, for junior class president. Thank you all. (audience cheering) (audience applauding) (audience cheering) (audience applauding) - I introduce the next candidate for president of the junior class, scholar, athlete, holder of many awards of distinction, William McCallister the Third. (audience cheering) (audience booing) (audience applauding) (audience applauding) - Thank you, Mr. Sherwood. Faculty, members of the junior class. As vandalism in our school increases, as the drug problem runs rampant, (audience cheering) we need, we need a candidate who can revive our sense of school spirit and personal dignity. (audience cheering) We have a candidate in our midst who has promised us the moon, but is there a reasonable person here who believes he will deliver? (audience murmuring) I think most of you realize the gentleman sitting by me on this platform is not the same man he was several months ago. A trip to the local police station will tell you the whole story. (audience booing) Do you want a class president with a criminal record? - No way! (audience cheering) - Or a proven leadership record in the school sports, academic, and student government programs? I trust today when you go to the polls you will make the right decision. Thank you. (audience cheering) (tense music) (audience applauding) (crowd murmuring) (crowd murmuring) - I'm sure we'll all very anxious to hear the results of the voting. There should be an announcement any minute. Please take out your papers on the most important thing in the world to me. We're going to read some of them out loud in class. (tense music) (crowd murmuring) (crowd murmuring) (crowd murmuring) (paper crinkling) (crowd murmuring) (crowd murmuring) (paper crinkling) - Lauren? - I wrote about my pom pom activities. (crowd murmuring) I have been in squad the entire last year, and I have obviously fulfilled my goal for this year too. - That's enough. (audience murmuring) - Mr. Dennis Wetzel? Would you like to read your paper for us please? - Okay. The most important thing in the world to me are animals. (audience giggling) My favorite things in the whole world are animals because they're very very curious of what we do, and-- - That's fine. Thank you very much. (crowd murmuring) - Mr. Sullivan. - Huh? - Would you kindly read your paper for us and stand up? - The most important thing in the world to me. Going on vacations, getting away from school. Partying with my friends, nice broads, fast cars, palm trees and sand. I like to surf some, maybe (murmuring) (paper crinkling) (crowd cheering) - Tim. Do you have something you'd like to share with us? - Uh. - What's your topic, Timothy? - It's really not that good. - Oh Tim. (crowd murmuring) (crowd murmuring) - Would you like to read your paper for us? - C'mon Tim, let's go. - Stand up. - Uh, vacations. Why are they so important? They give your mind and body a break from the routine of life. They give your body a rest. That's all. (students cheering) (students applauding) - We have an announcement that you've all been waiting for. (students murmuring) Wayne McCallister has just been elected class president. (students murmuring) - You're serious? - Marty Sullivan with the second largest number of votes, our new vice president. (students murmuring) - Recall. (students murmuring) - Please pass your papers to the front of the class. - Can't believe that. (students murmuring) (tense music) (water running) (water splashing) - Sorry to hear about the elections, Marty. - Criminal record, man. I didn't get no criminal record. I'm gonna kick that fairy's head in right in front of his friends this weekend, man. You wanna help me? - I got plans, you know? - You don't get this kinda stuff when you're hurt do you? Hey, how about going fishing with your old pal, Marty, huh? We ain't done it much since you went up to that church camp. - I got a lot going this weekend. I'm sorry. - Later, okay? - Yeah. (door thudding) - I'll pass. - You can't pass. - He doesn't have to sue. - Alright, I'll send you back 10 spaces then. - Alright. Camp has taken all the guts out of my kid. - I met some new kids at school. They invited me to their church car wash this weekend. - Oh, I think that's wonderful. - What's so wonderful about a car wash? - Would it be alright if I went on a retreat to Leech Lake next month? - A what? - Leech Lake? - Sounds like something out of the dark ages. - What do they do at this retreat or whatever you call it? - They lock you in a cell, shave your head, and make you kneel on Uncle Ben's converted rice. - We're gonna go white water canoeing up there. - Oh, that sounds wonderful. You can practice your J-stroke. I think that sounds alright. Sid? - Meg, you're so trusting. We don't even know these people. This could be a cult or something. (papers rustling) - Okay, let the kid get cloistered on some Jim Jones weekend on some Leech Lake and come back a religious freak. That'll be just great. (dice rattling) Oh. (crowd murmuring) (crowd murmuring) (crowd murmuring) (crowd murmuring) (footsteps scraping) (tense music) - Glad you could be with us, today, Tim. - Thanks a lot. I'm really trying to find some new fellowship. You see, my parents aren't exactly Christians. - Put the Christian beliefs into a systematic situation of non-situational ethics. You're trying to say that there's some kind of formula or something. - I'm not saying that there was a formula. Now I'm saying that if you say that, (murmuring) (window sliding) - That's the same hole you tried to put me in when you used your post millennialism literalism from the Duncan Bible. - Hey, you guys! (tense music) (crowd murmuring) (crowd murmuring) (crowd murmuring) - Hey, where'd you get those shorts? K-Mart? (laughing) - Whoo! (teens taunting) - Turkeys. - Hey, don't forget the play tonight. (firework sizzling) - Whoo! (footsteps squeaking) (firework sizzling) (firework sizzling) (firework sizzling) (footsteps squeaking) - Whoo! - Ha, ha. - Speech. - Whoo! - Can we do something for you guys? - Why don't you just call the police? - Oh yeah, that would be the Christian thing to do. (laughing) (items rattling) (door clicking) - What are you gonna do with all that money you make? - We're going on a canoe trip. It's none of your business. - Ooh! Away from the car, away from the car. - I wish you were doing something constructive. - That's the thing, we do things, destructive! (laughing) (cheering) - Hey, you guys, we're trying to wash cars. - Oh, is that what you're doing here? (laughing) - Wash our car then. - Yeah, really, go right ahead. - I'm going inside to call the police. - I got a message for you, guy. Somebody wants to give you some compliments, some kind words about the election. - Yeah, really. (egg cracking) (footsteps thudding) (cheering) - Hey! - Hey, c'mon you guys. Fighting's not gonna solve anything. - Let him go, let him go, that's it. Break it up! Back off, back off, stay down. You're not going anywhere. - Hey! Easy, easy. (engine revving) (door thudding) (footsteps thudding) - [Tim] I could see that my friendship with Marty meant a lot more to him than I realized. Him stealing money from the church and setting up his friends to throw firecrackers at us. I think he was bothered by a lot more than just the election. (crowd murmuring) (papers rustling) - Marty Sullivan. Does anyone know where Marty is? He's been absent from class for an entire week now. - Overdosed. - Alright class, let's get started with our homework. I'm asking you your opinion. What is the greatest writing in world literature? - The Red Badge of Courage by Stephen Crane. - Curious George. (laughing) - Would you say that this is an adult-- - High quality reading. - Oh yes. - Tim? - Uh, I don't know. I haven't read that many books. - There are a number of books on the desk that you could use for reference. (door clicking) (tense music) Marty? Please come to the desk. (papers rustling) - Who paid your bail Marty? - You have these assignments missing in addition to the ones given out in class today. I suggest you get someone to tutor you. Perhaps there's someone who would like to help him with his-- - Mrs. Buell, I'd like to help him. - Thank you, for your kind offer Dennis. I suggest you come in after school, and make up some of this work. If you do not, I have no other choice, but to flunk you for the entire quarter. Marty? Do you care? - Of course I care. (crowd murmuring) - Tell Joe to tell Bob to tell Steve that I'm not talking to Dave any more, and he should call me if he wants to talk. Give this to Bob yourself and tell me what he says. - Your phone number's on it. - So what? - Hey, Tim. How you doing man? How are your Bible buddies? - Alright, how you doing? - Hey man, why dontcha sit down? - [Becky] Tim! - I gotta get going. - Hi Tim. (crowd murmuring) - How's it going? - Hey, we were just talking about the retreat. - Oh yeah? - Ron asked me to be his canoe partner, but I said I'd really have to pray about it, and Larry asked me and I said maybe. And, Frank asked me, but we're not really on the same wavelength if you know what I mean. - Yeah. - Well? Are you gonna ask me or not? - Oh, sorry, yeah. You wanna be my canoe partner? (fish tanks gurgling) - Can I help you? - Oh, hi. I didn't know you worked here. - Yeah, my angelfish aren't reproducing. - Um, Angelfish. (birds squawking) Uh, this oughta do it. - Edible and tropical flies and other insects. They gonna eat this stuff? - They'll fight for it. - Not gonna get busted for having this, am I? (laughing) How much do I owe you? (birds squawking) - $4.75. Hey, Tim, would you like to come to our Bible study? - Yeah, um-- - It's me, Dennis, and Mrs. Buell's our sponsor. - At school? - Uh huh. - Well, we'll see. (fun music) * I want you here with me * That you can keep another company * As we recover life * On your TV * You love the word and you're avoiding me * And I love you * Still more and more * But you're fighting everything I'm working for * You're acting like my enemy * You love the word and you're avoiding me * You love the word * You love the word * You love the word and you're avoiding me (cheering) - I'm so dizzy. - From all the rides? - No, from you. - Hey, you about ready to go? - Are you kidding? I wanna go on at least two more rollercoaster rides. - I'm afraid we're all out of money. - Oh, but Tim, it was worth it. He's so cute. - Becky, there's something I really wanted to talk to you about. (organ chiming) - What is it? - Well, something I've been wanting to talk to you about for awhile, but it's kinda hard to say. - Go on. - I really feel like I've let the Lord down lately. - Is that all you're worried about? - Yeah, I mean-- - (laughing) Timmy, you've been spinning around too much today. (tense music) (door clicking) (door thudding) (papers rustling) (papers rustling) (footsteps thudding) (footsteps squeaking) (food wrappers crinkling) (tv clicking on) (tv murmuring) - B+ average, always turns in his work on time. - Mrs. Buell, we wanted to talk to you about something else. - Yes? - Tim went up to this summer Christian camp and, well, he had one of these conversion experiences. - He got born again. - I see. - Yeah and we think Tim might be in a cult. - He's not in a cult, dear. - Well, we're worried. - We're not worried. We're hoping he's in remission if you know what I mean. Tim was such an All American boy. - He used to party, go after the girls, just like I did when I was a kid. Mrs. Buell, Tim wants to be a missionary now, and he knows there's no money in it. - [Meg] They pay him something. - He buys Christian records with his allowance money. We even caught him in bed, reading religious literature. - The Bible, Sidney. - Now can you tell me that this is normal behavior for a 16 year old? - 17 year old. - Mr. and Mrs. Hughes please hold on a minute. Let me tell you that there are a number of so-called Christians here, and most of them don't do anything but talk. (cup clinking) - Why don't you give some of your soccer friends a call? - They drink too much. - What would be wrong with calling some of your old friends from your Boy Scout patrol? - They're not my type anymore. All they do is play video games. - Oh, what about Alex Fondell? - Ran away from home. - Okay, what about that little fella? - Dave? Drug overdose, St. Mary's. - Whatever happened to that guy that came around here on the weekends, and ate like a horse? Larry-- - Reed? - Yeah. - Department of Corrections. Look Dad, why can't I just hang around with the kids I want to? - [Sid] From the church? - So I guess you guys have been talking about me today huh? - Yes, because we care about the kind of kids you hang around with. - Alright, you want me to go out drinking and partying again? - Not just drinking, but-- - Alright, well that's what's gonna happen, and you don't care, do ya? - I think we're making a lot of fuss over a few beers. - And reefer and pills? - You don't have to do everything they do. - But you don't care if I end up like them, do you? - Sid, this isn't what you want. - What I want is this kid to show some normal social behavior. Look, I just like to see you, like regular kids, that's all. - Alright, I'll do what you want. See if it makes you feel any better. - You blew it this time, you jerk! (tense music) (door squeaking) - Tim! - Hey, hi Tim! - Hi, how you doing? (crowd murmuring) - Ideas on what? - I think we could talk to people. - Yeah. - Yeah, but we should try to reach people, like, that no-one really cares about. (crowd murmuring) - How are people gonna know the word of Jesus if we don't show it? - Then it would meld. (tense music) (shoes squeaking) (ball bouncing) (shoes squeaking) - With the parents to be given a voucher that's good at the school of their choice. (murmuring) - As a terrorist, how do you feel after you've killed someone? - What do you mean? (clippers clicking) - It's so nice. - Thanks. - We're going to take over the entire world with computers in four and a half years. - I got it, thank you! (murmuring) (murmuring) (knuckles rapping) - Here you go, Mrs. Wishlinski. - Thank you. - Rice A Roni. - We're here today to interview Mr. X. - Do you mean we're not going to go anywhere after this? - No, we have to study. - I am studying. - I mean the problem. - You mean you asked me all the way up here just to tutor me? - Yeah. - Don't I turn you on? - Yeah, I mean you're not bad looking. - Usually, when I go on dates, we get right to the point. (chuckling) So we're different now. I like that. (radio murmuring) (radio murmuring) (radio murmuring) (radio murmuring) (radio murmuring) (radio murmuring) (radio murmuring) (clubs rustling) - Say, Sidney, has your son gotten into some religious group? - Not anymore, why? - I haven't seen your boy in several years now, but I could have sworn I saw him the other day at our house. - Oh? (ball clinking) - Yeah, he was representing some church group. You see, my son's pet turtle died last week, and he came by with a new one. Kind of a gesture of good will. (chuckling) - What? You sure you got the right kid? - Well, you did say your son was into religion, didn't you? - Well, he used to be into religion. (crowd cheering) (crowd cheering) - Yeah! (crowd cheering) (crowd cheering) - Whoo! - Alright! - You're a real Cubs fan, aren't you Tim? - Oh yeah. - They probably didn't have any trouble hearing you cheer for 'em, either. - No way. (tense music) - Have you been as loyal to Jesus Christ as you have to the Cubs team lately? - [Tim] No, I haven't. I'm really confused about something. My best friend Marty needs to hear about Christ, but the Bible says we're not supposed to hang around with kids who smoke dope and drink. I just don't know what to do. - Here, Tim, read this. - But the Pharisees, and the teachers of the law, who belonged to those said to complain to His disciples. "Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?" Jesus answered them "it is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but the sinners to repentance." (engine whirring) (tense music) (crowd murmuring) (crowd murmuring) - Good job! - No! - I'm serious! (crowd murmuring) (crowd murmuring) (door squeaking) - Hey, where's your car? - What do you care? - I was wondering if you wanted any help. - Help? - Yeah I heard you got kicked outta school. - Hey, I didn't get kicked outta school, alright? I decided to leave. - Alright, just wanted to know if you wanted some help. - What, so you tutor me then? You get your Christian brownie points for the day? Sorry. - Hey, Marty, what happened man? What did you do man? (engine revving) - Look, Tim, you think I've got it all together, but I don't, alright? My parents are getting divorced. I'm flunking outta school. I lost my best friend. - I'm sorry, man. - I always wanted to see what it was like to give at a blood bank but I made a mess of that too. (cars revving) I've even been down to Mexico picking up cocaine, went to a drug rehabilitation center at North Oaks. - I never knew. - Look, Tim, ever since first grade, me and you been best friends, and then suddenly you become a Christian, you don't wanna get contaminated any more. What have I done? That you have to avoid me, man? I'm walking down the hall at school you pretend not to see me. Call you up on the phone you're not home, but I hear you in the background. What's with you, Tim? - I was ashamed. Listen, why don't you come to church with me? (chuckling) - Church, man. I gotta go check out a motorcycle. (tense music) (door clicking) (plastic crinkling) - [TV Host] Men should be lovers of their own selves. - These TV evangelists. (chuckling) Who do they think they are, God? - [Sid] Predict the future. What do they know about the future? - [TV Sports Announcer] Low outside, ball three! - Sid. - Hmm? - I've been very concerned about Timmy lately. - Yeah, me too. - It's those new friends he hangs around with. - Here it comes. Okay, what is it? - Well, I was uptown the other day, and, I saw some of them, and they are very strange looking. - Couldn't be any different than when we were kids, so what's the big deal? - Sid, I was in Timmy's room today, and I found a bag of marijuana on top of his desk. - So? - Sidney! (laughing) - Hey, what'd you expect? - [Meg] This isn't like Tim! Even before camp! - [Sid] Most kids his age occasionally take recreational drugs. It's normal. - Recreational drugs? - [Sid] The way you sound, it's my fault that he's taking this stuff? - [Meg] You are the one who told him to start loosening up. - Fine, let him grow up to be a missionary in some cockamamie jun, gle. (tense music) - Mom, Dad, I, couldn't help but hear your conversation. Mom, you don't have to worry. That was fish food that you found today. Those weird kids are dropouts that our church group is trying to help. Dad, I just wanted to tell you that I love and respect you very much. (sighing) (phone clicking) (phone dialing) (phone ringing) - Hello. - Hi, is Tim in? - [Meg] Oh, Tim went to church with Becky Olsen. You want me to have him call you back, Marty? - No, that's okay. - [Meg] Marty, is everything alright? - Yeah, I'm fine, I'll see you later. - [Meg] Bye, Marty. (phone clicking) - What are you thinking about? - I don't know. I was just thinking about Marty. What if he got saved? - Yeah we're gonna have to pray for him. I have such a burden for him. - Noticing something else. We're in his neighborhood. Tim he's not gonna pull anything on us. - Well, why don't we stop by his house, and see if he wants to go to church with us? - What? (chuckling) I'm glad you're only joking. - I'm not! - Tim, he's not gonna fit! - Sure he will, just like an old shoe. - I don't see why you're trying to do this to someone who's so against the Lord. I really wanted to be alone with you this afternoon. - We'll be alone, you, me, and Marty. (sighing) (engine revving) (engine revving) (engine revving) (door thudding) (metal rapping) (shoes squeaking) (door clicking) - Marty? - How you doing, Tim? - Alright, how you doing? - She doing in the car? - We're going to church, and I was wondering if you wanted to come along. - No thanks, man, I got plans with Debbie. - Tell you what, I'll play you for it. - I win, you gotta come to church with us. - You win, I'll wash and wax your car for two months. (fun music) - It seems like a pretty easy way for me to get some free car washes. Are you serious? - Yup, let's play to five. * So you're asking me questions you want to know * What are my reasons and why do I go? * We're following Jesus (ball bouncing) * High and low - Come on you guys. You're wasting time. (ball bouncing) * I'll tell you * in Heaven how it'll be * Living with Jesus eternally (ball bouncing) * Always giving His love * And His spirit to me We're gonna be late for church. (ball bouncing) * He'll help you to see * You'll call me a dreamer * Right from the start (ball bouncing) * You say it's a fantasy * warm in my heart * While something inside me - Hey, you know, Becky don'tcha? - Hey, Beck, how's it going? - Fine thanks. - Where we going, man? - We're going to a meeting. - Church. - Hey, man, get me out of here. - Be cool, alright? We'll party afterwards. - We'll go party, how about the ice cream shop? - I feel like going home. - Hey, man, I heard there's gonna be a party in some guy's basement this afternoon. - Well, we've already made plans, thanks. - Over 250 people there, it's gonna be a major big. It's gonna be open, it's gonna be massive. - We got time before church. What do you say we pick up somebody? - It was just a big mess. They shouldn't have come. Do you think you're gonna save the whole school or something? Do you know what kind of reputation you're gonna get if you keep this up? (door squeaking) Have a seat. - Uh, say, Tim, you don't mind if I go driving with these guys, do ya? - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'll get a ride. You don't need to worry. - Alright, I guess I'll see you Saturday then. - Okay, alright, but you can paddle with Dennis or someone, okay? - But I thought you and me were gonna go together. - Yeah, but I kinda changed my mind. I gotta go, okay? - Thanks. Well. (laughing) (tense music) - [Marty] Can you believe it? The fallen Marty Sullivan. - What's it like living here all by yourself? - It's kinda strange. Kinda feels like you don't belong to anybody. Nobody cares. - I know someone who does. - Who? - Jesus. - I'd like to see God that way, but I can't. All I can see is the youth group. You see the way they stared at me in church? - You just can't look at them. You gotta look at Jesus. I mean he didn't hang around with only straight people. He hung around with the guys with bad reputations. - Looks like a God. Somebody standing over me with a big club, ready to wail on me if I did anything wrong. - You just can't look at Him like that. I mean God loved us so much that He sent His Son to die on a cross for us. We're going on a canoe trip this weekend. I was wondering if you wanted to come. - Right here is where we pull in, just after the three mile bridge. And do not, I repeat, do not canoe any further than right here because there's some class four whitewater, and you don't wanna mess with it. Any questions? - Can you swim? - Yes, I can swim. Can you swim? - Yeah. - Good, and make sure you got all your life preservers on before you get into the canoes, alright? Okay, everybody have fun, and look out for one another, okay? Alright. (paddles rustling) (crowd murmuring) (crowd murmuring) - This is a church group, you're not supposed to smoke here. - Hey, Marty, I just wanted to tell you I'm really glad you could come today. - Hey, you can come too, wanna ride me? - [Girl] What an idiot. (tense music) (canoes scraping) (crowd murmuring) (canoes scraping) (crowd murmuring) (crowd murmuring) (crowd murmuring) (crowd murmuring) * It only takes a spark * To get a fire going (footsteps rustling) (crowd singing) (paddle clunking) (canoe scraping) (water splashing) (water splashing) - [Tim] The idea of laying down your life for your best friend. I wasn't just risking my life for Marty. Everything seemed to be on the line that night. (water splashing) Including giving away all my life to Jesus Christ. (water splashing) (water splashing) (branches cracking) (water splashing) (water splashing) (water splashing) (water splashing) (water splashing) (water splashing) (water splashing) (water splashing) (water splashing) (water splashing) (water splashing) (water splashing) (water splashing) (water splashing) (water splashing) (water splashing) - [Marty] Don't let go!

Yes, this is Mr. Hughes. Leech Lake General? (murmuring) - Pulse? (murmuring) - Check eyes. - Eyes are dilated. (murmuring) - Would you like to pray with me, Sid? - Pray? Meg this isn't the time for that. - If this isn't the time, then when is? (hospital staff chattering) - Doctor, he's fibrillating! (pads rattling) - Clear! - [Doctor] Clear! - Honey, this is the fourth time I've asked you, and you still haven't given me a straight answer yet. Would you like to pray with me? - Yeah, yeah, do what you want. - Dear Lord-- - Oh, come on, you got the guy's attention already! Say something. - [Tim] Please, Lord, I wanna go back. They still need me here. My Dad, Marty, all the kids in school. Please give me one more chance. I have a chance to stand up. (murmuring) (murmuring) - We don't know what happened, Lord, and we're so worried. Please, God, let him live. (machine beeping) - [Doctor] It's a miracle. I don't understand it. (machine beeping) (calm music) - [Tim] Summer melted into autumn, autumn into winter. Like a mighty wind, something amazing happened at Roosevelt High School. A big change. Jesus was becoming real for a lotta kids at our school. - [Staff] I now call on the vice president of the junior class. - I was in this canoe, by myself, cause I kinda felt left out by the group. And I got caught in some bad whitewater. It got dark, and I thought I was gonna drown, but then I saw Tim coming to help me, and it was like the Lord because Tim got all messed up trying to save my life. Anyways, the school has decided to give this award here to Tim Hughes, my best friend. (crowd applause) (crowd applause) (crowd applause) - I just hope he doesn't start talking about religion. - Sidney, in front of all these people? - Instead of talking about myself, or some heroic deed that any of you would have done if you were in my shoes, I'd like to give some credit to a real hero. Little while ago, I coulda probably talked to you about Wayne Gretzky or-- - What's the matter dear? - I can't help it, Meg. I'm proud of him. - I wouldn't have been able to talk to you about my real hero. I was too ashamed. But now, I realize that my hero is never ashamed. He was born in an eating trough for animals, and He died in a garbage mound between two criminals. He ate with prostitutes and thieves. He washed His friend's feet, and got mocked without saying a word. He didn't die because He had to. He died for you and me because He loves us. His name is Jesus Christ. He's alive today, he's right here in this assembly, and he wants to come into all your hearts. He wants to be a part of your lives, and a part of this school too. I hope you'll let him come in. Thank you. (crowd applauding) (crowd applauding) (crowd applauding) (calm music) (hopeful music) * The end of all our prayers * Is to care like man or guest * My one and only goal * His image in my soul * Yes my weakness is being me * Goodbye his life shall be * He's faithful and He's true * To complete my work if He gets in you * I want to * I need to * Be more like Jesus * I want to * I need to * Be more like Him * Our Father's will was done * Forgiving as the Son * Who paid the highest cost * To point us to the cross * And when I think of Him * Taking on the whole world's sin * I take one look at me * Compared to what I'm called to be * I want to * I need to * Be more like Jesus * I want to * I need to * Be more like Him * Remember, there's no way in life * But to lay down your life * For a friend (Wind whistling)
