Hey, we can't fit in here! Someone small, okay? Kids. Send the young ones in there. Get in there! Gas! Help! Help! Help! Where are you going! Do you want to die? Not today. Get in! Get in! "November 1944" "Korean Quarter, Hashima Coal Mine, Japan" I'm sorry. You've had to pay for my generation's sins. I wish you success. Grow old and fight for Korea. We'll come back for you. Don't you worry about an old man like me. Just live a good life. Time is running out. Let's go. Won't you come with us? Then who will care for Mr. Yoon? Even the weather is helping you out. It's time. Hurry. Go on! Be careful! If one of you is killed on the way, leave him or you'll all die. Care only for yourself until reaching Nomo Peninsula. Hide there for a day to rest up, then go to Nagasaki. A lot of people get caught in Nagasaki as well, ...so don't rest easy until you reach Korea. Please survive, and let's meet in a better world. Hurry! Don't move! Stop or we'll shoot! You want to get killed too? How much further? What? -What? -How much further to go? We're almost there! Keep going! Mr. Yamada! Should we fish them out? Why bother? Just report that we found them drowned. With three catches, we'll get a bonus! Let's go back, quickly! One, two, three! "The Battleship Island" It's not the front line, why get so uptight? -It's no joke. I've been drafted. -Oh my, drafted? Don't you intellectuals know that slogan? "The people have a duty to the nation." Then will you send your son to do his duty? My son has tuberculosis! If not for that, he could serve in the rear like you, earn money... ...and support the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity. What's with this damned music? Take this. Mister Lee! Mister Lee! Damn. Are you going to play this music all night? We're sending boys off to war, it's too gloomy! -Don't you have any nice jazz? -Be quiet. Why? You know that jazz is banned. You want me arrested? My gosh! Who's going to arrest you? This room is filled with high-ranking, well-connected people. We need some fun for once. You want some fun? That'll cost you a bit of hazard pay. Oh, gosh. All right. "1956, February 7th. Peninsula Hotel, Myeongdong." Where's Gangok? On the stage. If he wants to stay out of jail, tell him to come down and find me. Huh, why? Did he make trouble again? Damned idiot fooled around with a section chief's wife! Gangok! Gangok! ♪ The tap dance of love. ♪ Until the night is gone... Gangok! Okay! Give her a hand! No, get out! Okay! Come on, everyone! ♪ With a glass of champagne ♪ Let's have ourselves a dance. Where's my wife? Stand up! Spin! Spin, you brat. Wait, daddy! Wait! Are you out of your mind? The section chief's wife likes my music. She kept offering to buy dinner, how can I turn it down? And the theater owner kept telling me to meet her. All we did was eat. If you get drafted for this, what will you do about her? I'm not going to be drafted! You think you'll get away with touching a section chief's wife? Then today you play jazz? Did you bring it? Here. It's nine musicians, including you. And your daughter makes ten. There'll be nothing left for me and my police colleagues. I'm always in your debt, Mr. Sugiyama. Look. I'll arrange a bribe for you and your band. I'm asking around the offices of Japanese factories. Explain the situation to your band well. And bring in some more cash. You always said you wanted to work in Japan. I heard the army was driven out of the Philippines again? Is Japan going to lose? That's all just talk. Don't you read the papers? There are thousands of U.S. POWs in Japan now. It'll be over before the cherry blossoms fall, trust me. We're going to see cherry blossoms? "1945, February 12th. Ferry to Shimonoseki" Get off, then. Let's go. God, what a smell. You should be sucking on your mom's breasts! What's a kid like you doing on this boat? I was on my way home, and the town clerk... ...puts me in a truck saying I'm about to earn money. Okay, okay. Couldn't even tell my parents before leaving. Tell me about it. They dragged me off on my wedding night. You're a newlywed? My gosh. I have already forgotten her face. You in the glasses, how'd you end up here? -I go to Keijo University. -Wow! Oh my Goodness! You an intellectual? Better than being drafted as a student soldier. My gosh. I heard if you work like crazy for one year, you get a house? But still, how could they drag off pre-pubescent boys? Snatching them from the fields, or when they're out wrestling. Give me the case. When the boat lands, we'll ditch these guys. - So bear it until then. - Okay. All of you brought cash? -Yes. -Take it out. This is our lifeline. Give me that. If we lose this we're dead. We must protect this, okay? Dad, where are we really going? You'll see later. Stop asking me! Go over there! You bastard! This bastard! There's a fight. -Isn't that Choi Chilseong? -The famous gangster? Stupid Koreans... can't help but fight each other. Stop fighting! Calm down! Sohee! Go away! Go! Any more trouble, we'll call it a riot and start shooting. What the hell is he saying? Hey! Can anyone here speak Japanese? If you freak out again they'll start shooting. So shut the crap up and calm down. How'd your mouth get so filthy? Is it as filthy between your legs? Did you ever see between my legs? Did you? Do you even know who you're talking to? Sit down! You look like gangsters from some Seoul slum. So if the Japanese slap you around, you take it out on Korean girls? Quiet! Sit down! All right, just let go. Sit down, guys. I said sit! Not much worth grabbing there anyway. Your poor mom probably felt happy when you came out with balls. Wow, she made a fool of him. Stick out too much, and people hate you. Sometimes you gotta keep your head down. Some people bring on their fate. "Shimonoseki Harbor, Japan" Dear passengers. The ferry from Busan to Shimonoseki has arrived. Japanese passengers, please await separate instructions. Sohee, listen to me. If you lose my hand, watch my back and follow me. - Guys, hold those cases tight. - Okay! -Stay focused. -Be careful with the handle. Hold this. Sohee! -Excuse me. -Pardon me. -Yes. This letter is from Detective Sugiyama of Seoul Central Police Station. Where can I find Mr. Shimura? -Mr. Shimura? -Yes. Yes! Detective Sugiyama from Seoul told me to find Mr. Shimura. There are lots of Shimuras here. This way, please. Hey, take them! Wait! Detective Sugiyama... "Recommendation Letter" Wait, let go! He told me to find Mr. Shimura! "Workers' Ferry to Hashima Coal Mine" Sohee, are you okay? I don't need that! Bastards! Stop it! Stop! Daddy! Daddy! Sohee! Sohee! Sohee, it'll be okay! Stay with those women! Please stop! Next! Take your bag and go! Jerks! It really is nothing, you see. I just have cigarettes. What's this? Give it here! Right now! Go, now! Don't stare. Eyes forward! Shut up and put your hands on your head! Hands on your head! On your head! Nothing. I have nothing. Foreheads on the ground! What do we do with these? It's war here, too. Get rid of that Korean habit of depending on everyone! Sir! Sir! You're Korean? Just a moment, please! There's been some kind of mistake. I was supposed to meet someone here. We haven't been drafted like the others. This is from Detective Sugiyama at Seoul Central Police Station! And this is our performing license. I'm Lee Gangok of the Lee Gangok Band. We released a record at Okay Record Company. We performed at Government Hall, Myeongdong Theater, Peninsula Hotel, everywhere! - Musicians? - 1, 2, 3, 4! What the hell is that? Why is there a child here? They said it's a factory. Why take off our clothes? Follow me! Are those tattoos? Here at Hashima Comfort Station... ...we've received a special medal for being free of venereal disease. Please keep yourselves clean and protect our perfect record. Next. Sir, just a minute. This is a luxury Western watch called Rolex. It was a gift from someone at the Governor-General's office. I'm sure you'll take care of things but I came here with my daughter. Lee Sohee. We came off the boat separately. She's just a little girl. If you could even tell me where she is... Can you play 'Cherry Blossoms of the Same Class?' Yes! Damned music men are settling in comfortably. ♪ You and I are... ♪ ...Cherry blossoms of the same class. ♪ Blooming in the same... ♪ ...Naval training ground. ♪ Any flower... ♪ ...is destined to fall, ♪ So let us fall brilliantly. ♪ For the sake of our nation. I see some talented men from Korea have arrived. - Welcome. - Yes! Thank you. My name is Lee... Sorry... sorry. I am the manager of Hashima Mine, Shimazaki Daisuke. We welcome you from distant Korea to fulfill your duty here... ...as loyal subjects of His Majesty the Emperor. I grant you the honor of taking part in the Imperial Army's war. For 50 years, ...this historic site... ...has led as a supplier of coal... ...to the industry of the Great Japanese Empire. The coal we produce here is not merely coal. A single lump of coal... ...is a drop of blood, ...a weapon, and a piece of history! Sons of the Emperor! I urge you to fulfill your duties... ...as glorious soldiers of industry, and to not dishonor the Imperial Japanese Army. Hurry up! "Japanese Residential Area Comfort Station" Filthy whore! Dirty! One Chinese woman got pregnant at the station. One woman got pregnant at the Chinese station, and they cut her stomach and took the baby out. And a few days later, she was receiving soldiers again. We will now assign dormitories! After locating your room, prepare quickly and gather outside. The account slips we give you... ...shows the transport fees you incurred while coming here. Traveling costs from Seoul and other cities to Busan... ...the ferry to Shimonoseki... ...and transport to Hashima Island have been covered by the company... "Korean living quarters" ...and will be deducted from your pay. Housing costs provided by the company... ...will be deducted from your pay. All personal items supplied to you... ...are covered by the company... ...and will be deducted from your pay. All expenses for meals... ...are covered by the company... ...and will be deducted from your pay. Hey, get up if you're done eating! For your future, national bond and savings fees, , health insurance and pension funds... ...are calculated in a lump sum and will be deducted from your pay. "Insurance Card/savings account" For the sake of those who don't speak our language, we employ translators... ...and provide job training. Various amenities and... ...necessary equipment are furnished. All these items will be deducted from your pay. If your first month's pay... ...is less than the company's expenses, fees will be deducted from your next pay. What the hell will we have left? I'll just run up debts here! Hey, get moving! Consider today a workplace tour to learn your duties. We at Hashima Mine... ...do not underestimate you for being Koreans. We believe you can excel from the first day. Stop! Masks on! Put your mask on! Masks on! Shit, he's falling down. You praying? Get up now! My freaking glasses broke! Your glasses broke, so you're talking back? Are you? Are you? Stop it, you bastard! Even dogs deserve to eat and wash in peace! -Why hit a young kid? -Step aside! What are you doing? Everyone sit down! Hey music man! You speak Japanese, right? Get over here! Translate for me! I'm ready to kick that yakuza bastard. Translate, now! I request to duel that Korean boss of yours. I'm that famous Seoul gangster Choi Chilseong. I came here to beat your Korean labor boss. "I am Choi Chilseong. I'm here to challenge that Korean labor boss." We fight samurai style, and if I win, me and my boys will watch over the Koreans. "We fight samurai style, and if I win, my boys and I will oversee the Koreans." If I lose, I'll treat him as my boss. "If I lose, that Korean boss will be my boss." You jerks. That was a swear word. Think you're a circus ringleader? Drag him off! Wait! That sounds like fun. All you need to do is win. There are new Korean girls at the comfort station. How about betting on a pass? Comfort station? Everyone stop! Koreans fighting each other is just what they want! The more we fight, the more we play into their hands! This bastard isn't Korean like the rest of us. What are you looking at, you stupid Koreans? From now on, I'll be leading the Koreans! If you back me, I'll keep the Koreans in line. Go talk to the labor office. Hurray for Choi Chilseong! And where did this freak come from? Let's whistle for him, new boss Choi Chilseong! Everyone bow! The beauties have arrived. Everyone take a seat. Sit! Go ahead, sit! - Hurry. - Here. This meal is to welcome you, so why are you melancholy? You, who will give up your bodies... ...to our soldiers fighting in the Great East Asian War... ...and to our soldiers of industry... ...are indeed invaluable assets. Take pride in yourselves. We used to employ first-class geisha or former actresses from film studios. Now mostly Korean women work here. But this innocence is part of their charm! This mood is too heavy for a feast of welcome. Play that record I brought. Yes, sir! To help you feel comfortable, I brought a Korean record which I enjoy. It's quite lively. We prepared beds for you here. So relax, listen to some music and get to bed early tonight. This is me singing! Malnyeon. I sang this song! Hey! What are you doing? Let her be! Tell them I sang this song! Tell them I sang it, please! Tell them! She sang what's playing right now. I can sing and dance, play instruments, whatever! I can clean and do laundry! She can perform, play instruments and is also good at housework. What did she do? He asked what did you do in Korea. I played music in Seoul. The Yamamura Band. She performed at the Yamamura Band. My father and the rest of the band are all here! Long live the Emperor! Hurray! Hurray! Long live the Emperor! Hurray! "1945 July, OSS Training Camp Liberation Army in China" How is your training with the OSS soldiers? I'm doing my best. You've got higher marks than the Americans. The Seoul infiltration operation you've been planning... He might get upset, but its best if he's left out. Recent info from OSS intelligence has come to us. The U.S. has developed a new bomb. They say its power is beyond imagination. The blast radius is up to 200km. If they drop that from a B-29 onto the Japanese mainland... That's all unconfirmed talk for now. The point is, the Soviets are about to invade. The U.S. has already taken Okinawa. If the Soviets join in, Japan won't last long. It's time to focus on winning the war, not the battle. For a speedy liberation, we must join together. Yoon Hakchul. Only he can resolve the conflicts... ...between all the factions fighting for Korean independence. He handled fundraising at the Korea Provisional Government (KPG), but two years ago he was caught by the Japanese... ...and disappeared without a trace. We assumed he was executed without trial, but according to U.S. Intel he was detained near Nagasaki... ...at Hashima Coal Mine. Go bring back Mr. Yoon. Gather around, everyone. If we screw up again, we'll be back in the mines. Do your best! And smile! If you don't smile, I'll have Chilseong take you back to the mine. Okay. Get ready, quick! Hey, why don't you eat that? Raw eggs are gross. Eat when I tell you, kid! It's great for your throat. Some people can't eat at all! Hurry up! Hey! Abracadabra... ta-da! Look at that grin. If you're gonna eat, then pay for it! Newbies who arrived today, just follow the man in front! They don't feed us crap. What the hell is he blabbering about? Isn't that dynamite? What will you do with it? Stop sputtering and be quiet! The liquid that seeps out is sweet. Need to eat at least that to survive. What if your stomach explodes? Give me a taste! Help me here! It's okay. It's just the coal dust in my lungs. Sir, are you okay? I'm fine! Hey, there's gas coming out! So what? Block off the gas! And pump out sea water! At the center of Japan's leadership in the Great East Asian War is Hashima Coal Mine! For the emperor and the Japanese Empire... For Hashima Mine and its executives returning to the head office! Cheers! Rock, scissors, paper! Rock! Rock! Okay, your turn. Didn't you get your fill? You okay? Support his back. Are you hurt? Hey kid, out of the way! Kid! Look out! Wait. What's that noise? Explosion! Run out quick! Bring your tools! Don't drop your tools, bring them! Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. How many times has Mine No. 2 caught fire? Do I need to step in every time this happens? What about the passage to Mine No.3? It hasn't spread there yet. How much is Mine 2 producing? It has the lowest production. We're already 1100 meters below the seafloor, so it'll be hard to mine deeper. Save me. Save the young ones first! Mr. Yoon! You must go up! Don't let anyone die! Not one! That's the Korean section, right? Seal them off. Prevent damage spreading to other mines. There are people here! You bastards! There are people here! Sir, Yoon Hakchul is in the mine! Out of the way! I told you not to put him in the mine! What if he dies and the Koreans riot? By whatever means necessary, get him out! -Hold on just a bit! -Yes! Do you want to work all day? Do you? They're waiting for you! Jonggu! There's a problem in Mine 2! Damn, I worked all night! Why'd they have to wake me up? Isn't that where we plugged the gas leak before? Hey, just shut your mouth and follow orders! Are you back on duty? Shit! -You sure this connects to Mine 3? -Shouldn't you know that? - What? You prick! - Blast through it. What? There's no other way. We point the gas at these supports, and light it. Newbie! Shut the crap up! There's no guarantee we can get enough gas here. You know... I hid this thing here. - We can't drill any deeper. - We can't! Gas keeps leaking, what if there's a fire? That's why we called you technicians! Okay, okay. -It's going in! -Keep drilling! Drill! Drill! Pull! Pull it! The Koreans heard there was an accident... ...but they don't know yet who lived or died. Announce we'll move wounded Koreans to a main hospital in Nagasaki... ...then send them to the crematorium and burn them with the corpses. There are limits to how many Koreans we can bring. Given the war struggles, will we allow the company to keep losing money? I'll be sure to contain the problem. Also, Mr. Chiba. When do you plan to inspect our mine? - The thing is... - I'm sorry! As I'm grateful for your recommendation of our facility... I mean to send someone to express my deepest gratitude. I see. You won't be disappointed. Where is Yoon Hakchul now? He's coming! He's coming! Here he comes! If the company doesn't release a list of casualties, ...and draw up compensation and safety plans, ...I will refuse all talks with Manager Shimazaki! We support you! We support you! That's enough! Go back! Wait a minute! You give me this. You're in charge of toilets now. You'll scoop piss and shit! Hey! Someone tell this madman not to hit me! Then give me my money's worth! I don't need any Korean bitches glaring at me. I'll drink when I want! Hey, calm down! You got trained by the Americans, but without their help, you think you can escort Mr. Yoon out of here? The plan was to use the network here... ...and contact Korean agents at OSS headquarters. Through an agent planted on the food ship that stops here, we'll go by ship to the U.S. base in Okinawa. How do we know you're not on their side? You say you're OSS-trained resistance? I was a student soldier sent to Japanese unit 7991 in China. And then I escaped last July in Xuzhou... ...and met KLA General Lee Beomseok in February at Chongqing. Did he send any personal message to me? He says he'll treat you to your favorite trotter stew at Hwapyung Restaurant. When do you plan to move? I'll send in another girl. Just sit. I said sit! I'm not here for romance. Why not? Do the marks on my chest make you go limp? Hell... Don't you need a Korean to complain to, to breathe easier? Damn, these damn mosquitoes are worse than the damn Japanese. At first, I was dragged to China. I had no idea. They said I was going to work. They drove me to a Japanese army base. Freaking hell! The mosquitoes bit me like crazy. Some mosquito bites can kill a person. One bite, and your whole body swells with fever. However much you drink, your insides burn. There was a girl from Heungyang. The Japanese said she was pretending to be sick, and they put her on nails and rolled her back and forth. She died in front of everyone. I was too scared to tell them I was sick. Figured I'd rather die fast, so I drank lye. It was a Japanese doctor who stopped me from dying. That was how I survived but then a Korean pimp washed me, and threw me right back at those Japanese guys. It was a Korean town clerk... ...who sent me to that comfort station far away from home! When the unit retreated, I barely escaped, but that Korean pimp caught and sent me here! So I need a Korean to complain to? To breathe easier? Biting the hand that feeds you. You need to control your temper. Sooner or later, things will get better. Are you doing a lousy job on purpose? Try finding any guy who won't get off on this! Dragging me out of the hospital to do this... Okay, here. I send out so many of these, why does so little come back? Damned guards cut the rations. You're not hoarding it yourself? Bro, just one cigarette. You still didn't pay for last month's. Goodness! The damned Japanese raised their pension funds or whatever! We all had them raised! So control your gambling! If you're broke, just sleep. Wait, pay me more! Geez. Give this to the attendant for 10 cigarettes. Yes, sir. Gangok, Manager Shimazaki is calling you. Sohee! What is it? Oh no... - A splinter. - Be more careful, kid! What's that smell? I've been thinking of this for a while. After today's accident, ...I thought I should meet you and propose something... ...before it's too late. I see. About your daughter... In the recent U.S. bombing of our head office, Mr. Chiba lost his daughter. Rather than having her stay here, where it's so dangerous... ...I was thinking... ...to send her to Mr. Chiba as an adopted daughter. Mr. Yamamura, we're in a war. In wartime, winners don't always survive. Survivors are true winners. On the next freight ship out, let's send Sohee. Oh? Wow! ♪ Meeting in this world of woe ♪ What is your wish? ♪ Will being rich makes you happy? Airplane! The post office key? We'll pay whatever you want. Hell, how would you know what I want? We'll give you this in advance. Wow, advance pay? I need to know what this is about. We need to check a package. I don't team up with people who keep secrets. If you need to check a package, isn't it easier to just bribe one of the labor officers? - The thing is... - We need the telegraph. The telegraph? Know how to use it? Just get us the key. A newbie wants to use the telegraph. A Korean who looks like an independence leader bribes me... What's going on here? Forget it, then. I already know, how can I forget? Should I go ask the boss to look into this? Park Mooyoung! Mr. Yoon will escape from here. Hey Gangok, all we need is the key, no trouble. You decide. If you don't cooperate, ...then we'll kill you. Hey, Yamamura! What are you doing out past curfew? Where have you been? I've been looking for you. The drawings are done, tell Maeda to see me tomorrow. - What, already? - Yes. 'I want one, too! But what are you doing here? They're fighting over gambling debts. I'm trying to mediate. Damn idiots! Shake hands! I'll take care of this, you go on. All right, then. Have a good night! You don't need to pay, but I have one condition. When he escapes, take me and my daughter. Gangok! I take it that old man won't be swimming? Since you want the telegraph, you must have something lined up. Either you kill me, or have the Japanese kill you... ...or take my daughter and me. This time, you decide. If our plan is leaked, I'll kill you myself first. One, two, three! One, two, three! Hey, wake up! Where the hell did he go? Can't he leave me alone? Hey, go to my spot! Hey painter! Where's the guy who made me a lock that time? Is he on the night shift? Why don't I see him? They sent him to the tool repair factory... ...to work as a technician, since he's good with tools. Tool repair factory? Shit. Good afternoon! I need a favor from the locksmith. -Do as you please. -Thank you. What brings you out here? You want another lock? No, I've got a really important key. I'm scared of losing it, so I'd like a copy. Hand it over. Yes, but I need to bring it back. Something smells fishy. How come you get all the luck? Which woman's home? You're quick. Her husband carries the key around. You know how it is. Here you go. See you later! Hello! We'd still be nice to Sohee without these gifts. I know, but treat her well! What are you sighing about? I talked to your supervisor lady. If I call you at night, then run right out. So, make sure to move to her room. Can't you ask the manager to let us stay together? Why? Did he do something? It's just that I'm lonely here... The other women ask me why do I pretend things are hard... ...even when the manager takes care of me. Damned bitches! That's why I told you to behave well with other people... ...and be careful with what impression you give! What are you crying about? Don't you know all that I'm doing for you? Think you're the only one who's got it hard? Why do you always say everything is my fault? Never mind. What do I say to you? Anyway... Always be ready, so you can run right out if I call you. Only then, we can be together, all right? Got a good movie for us? Yes, a love story! Good evening. Want to see a dirty picture? Oh good! Come this way. The outside door, the office and the director's room. You remember my terms? I have eyes everywhere, you know. Hey, boss! What is it now? Nothing, I want to show you something. What the hell? It won't open? Gangok, that rat! -Hey, bastards! Someone! -No! "Hashima Eagle Contacted" "Preparations to transport Eagle complete" "Number of passengers?" "Yoon and Park" "Two" "Sending food transport ship in 48 hours, 5 AM" "Find Takagura on Transport Ship" "Hoping for safe return. End" "Korean Account Records" Seems the war is going badly. When was the last time Japan used good paper like this? What do propaganda pamphlets have to do with the war? The U.S. still has enough money to make pamphlets with good paper. Aren't wars ultimately won by those with the most money? Give me the relevant documents for me and the other Koreans. More leaflets littering our island. Those are bombers. Citizens and employees. Because of U.S. bombardment, turn off lights and stay indoors. I repeat. Citizens and employees. Because of U.S. bombardment, turn off lights and stay indoors. It's time. Why so cheap this time? Too many people involved now, I want to wrap it up. Where's the attendant? Let's go. Damn those bastards! Sir, it's time for your medicine. Sir? Quiet around here. Sohee! Sohee... What is it? Yamamura? Come on in. All right. Where's Sohee? Quick, Sohee... I'll meet Sohee, then go to your room. Shit. When did you last see Park Mooyoung? What? Mr. Yoon is missing. I couldn't say goodbye to anyone. What kind of operation is this? I had to keep everything completely secret. And I have something to ask you first. I found Koreans' pay records in the post office safe. The pensions and bond payments... ...taken from their paychecks, ...don't go to their accounts, but to someone else's. Your name is entered on their contracts... ...and half the money flowing into your account... ...is forwarded into Manager Shimazaki's account. Are you aware of this? Since coming here, I've heard that pay is embezzled by the manager and several others. But an account in my name? Even dead workers' compensation is going in there... ...without their families being told of their deaths. Shimazaki... I never thought he'd go this far. Looking through the documents, I kept seeing your signature. Who could have made those files? Didn't it occur to you that Shimazaki could've made it? No labor strike or escape plan has ever succeeded here. I wonder why. If you set up a leader of the Koreans, and then use him. Then, this kind of control is possible. Can you explain how a man caught delivering huge sums for the KLA... ...could have received no trial from the Japanese... ...and ended up here? This is just what Shimazaki wanted. Should I answer for you? You fool! Shimazaki knew someone like you was coming. You converted. If you weren't on their side, you'd be in jail. Park Mooyoung! No one will follow you once they find out. Why do you think... ...Shimazaki agreed to negotiate over their protection of Koreans? Why? Negotiate? So dragging little boys off to mines and stealing their money... ...was a negotiation? If you're so convinced of my guilt... ...then just... ...shoot me. You scoundrel! Trying to run off without us? I warned you! That if you betray me, I'll report you! - You stay there! - Gangok! Listen closely to me. This is an American spy with no connection to Korea. If you report him... ...the two of you can escape. If Shimazaki finds out, you all die! What was your real goal in coming here? Sohee! When I shout, run to Manager Shimazaki and tell him everything! He's on Shimazaki's side! Goddamn bastards! Then when does the ship come? Daddy! Sohee, it's okay. Just stay still. Why do you take the girl? Let go of her. Drop the gun first. -Sir, are you okay? -I'm fine, go watch over our men. -Park Mooyoung has betrayed us! -Put down the gun, now! Our men are on the way. Stop being stupid! Try reading this. -What kind of plot is this? -Shut up, you scoundrel! Coming to save someone like you... Don't you feel sorry for them? Ito Takamichi, Yoon Hakchul... I will report your treason to the Provisional Government of Korea. You bastard! Run, quick! This way, quick! This way! Hurry! You Koreans, wait there! Block the Koreans! -I am Japanese! -Grab them! Shut the gate! Get in, quick! You bastards! You bastards! Why are you shooting? Help! Open the door! Sook, get up! You want to die? Let me go! Sook! Stop! Don't shoot! -Who are you? -I'm Ito... Yoon Hakchul! Sir! -Sir, are you okay? -I'm fine. Are you hurt? How are you? I'm okay. Let's get away from here. About that account book... Don't worry about that. I'll go back and get it. Did you see what was in it? Sir, I believe you to the end. Help! Someone help! Help me! That man, he shot... -Be quiet! Sir, are you all right? Sir, what will we do? How could this happen to us? You there! Did Gangok die too? Someone thought they saw his corpse, so we're looking... Gangok, where are you? Daddy, I'm thirsty. Why are you playing around and giving me this? -Any food here? -Probably. Drive out the Koreans! Drive out the Koreans! Drive out the Koreans! Drive out the Koreans! Does the line work? Hold out as long as you can with the food and water you have. Our manager will never recover! Are you telling us to just die? Yesterday the U.S. dropped a new bomb on Hiroshima! A new bomb? Word is coming in that it's tremendously powerful. There's no official report yet... ...but it's said there are 100,000 casualties... ...and no living thing survived. The Americans have created something unimaginable. Are we... ...going to lose this war? After Hitler's death and the fall of Germany... ...industrialists who helped the Nazis... ...are being lined up and trialed as war criminals. If you have any materials that can be used against us, burn them! If it's a war crimes trial... ...shouldn't we kill the Koreans who could testify against us? That'd be the most effective solution but with Shimazaki in that state... Can it be done? If you take care of things properly, then surely you can take his place. Drive out the Koreans! Drive them out! You little prick. You ruined everything! Does it hurt a lot? I can't believe this. Corpses will be burned to prevent disease, so finish identifying the bodies! What about Japanese corpses? Why is it only us who are burned like garbage? So as not to create more panic... ...for now, only you and I must know of the manager's death. Take this for now. I couldn't find what you described, so I just took anything. I heard a Japanese schoolgirl was murdered. Korean attendant Song Jonggu says he saw it. And the suspect is Korean. That's good news. Now we have a justification to crack down on the Koreans. Hey! Hey! Sohee! Bro, you're alive? You think I'm dead? Why'd you want to meet here, and not the kitchen? There's someone who can't know the two of us are alive. Have this. What the hell? Eat this? Hey, take a can from my bag. It disappeared in the bombing. What? What about my money? All of it? Goddammit! My goodness! It was a life-or-death situation! Why didn't you get it? Where have you been? It's a long story. Is Yoon Hakchul asking about me? Until the situation stabilizes, I will carry out the duties of our wounded manager. During this vicious American attack... ...when everyone is heartbroken, an innocent, pretty young girl... ...lost her life to a savage who couldn't control his lust! Can you see this innocent victim's family? If you've any conscience, come forward! What evidence do you have that it was a Korean? Get rid of the Koreans! Witness, come forward! Identify the suspect. He was with us yesterday! You scumbag! Don't overdo it, you thug. Ah, I want some cold soy noodles! With savory broth, and salt on top. I like it better with sugar. All right, sugar it is. Pull out a mouthful of those noodles... With radish kimchi on the side... Oh, let's stop this! Only makes me hungrier. When we get out of here, let's go eat noodles first. Then, we'll go back home? Of course. That's why your dad is helping me. But right now, there's something I need you to help me with. Will you help me? Mr. Ito. If you get a chance to leave this island, you'll take it? If I take you to the U.S. occupied zone... ...can you tell them I helped you to look after the laborers... ...and supported Korean liberation? If the manager is dead, you'll probably get his position. Is that really necessary? I've thought it over. We're both smart enough to know... ...how this war will end. In return for getting you out, ...give me the money you pocketed with the manager. Can I leave right away? The coal transport ship is almost repaired. Our communications are back... ...and it's no problem to leave here with you. But if I want to take my family from Nagasaki, I'll have to follow the head office's command... ...and deal with all the Koreans. Deal with? No Korean who remembers what happened here must be allowed to survive. Where did that old man Yoon Hakchul hide it? "Record of Korean Laborers" You lost your position as the Korean leader... ...and took out your grudge against a Japanese girl. But she fought back and you strangled her. That's how you killed her. Is that so hard to admit? Hey! Just say it's true and sign with your thumbprint. Then I'll treat you like my older brother. Song Jonggu... I'm gonna fold you like a blanket, and chop you into pieces, you bastard. Gather all the remaining dynamite! Tomorrow we'll put all the Koreans in the mine. Tomorrow morning... Yamada plans to force all the Koreans into the mine and kill us. Women of course, and even children. I beg you. I won't ask for myself, but please take Sohee away from here. I'm sure you can at least take her with you. I'm going to escape. With all the Koreans here. In this place where we sweated and toiled at, we have a right to proper treatment! Today's arrest of Choi Chilseong as a murder suspect... ...is no different from what all us Koreans have suffered! Therefore I requested to Manager Shimazaki... ...to stop Koreans from being unfairly accused... ...and demanded an open trial! -Out of the way. -Let's go. And furthermore... ...I reached an agreement with the manager. First! We will be given the same quality food as the Japanese! Second! The coal quotas raised last month will be lowered! Third! Full time off on holidays! Fourth! Work to repair the island will be compensated! And finally! Injured young workers will all be returned... ...to our homeland Korea! We'll send them home! There's just one condition! Given what we will receive, we need to show our sincerity. Tomorrow is Hashima Mine's first opening since the bombing. The manager has asked, as a show of our unity and for a new start, ...that all Koreans including women and children... ...to join the opening ceremony inside the mine. What do you all think? I object! Yoon Hakchul never met the manager today. The manager is dead. If you enter the mine tomorrow... ...acting Manager Yamada will have you buried. -What? -Park Mooyoung, stop trying to stir chaos! The U.S. has invaded Okinawa, and the war is almost over. Yoon Hakchul and Yamada plan to bury you here, and then escape to the U.S. army. Friends! That man is a spy trying to divide us Koreans! A spy! All of you here... ...are decisive witnesses of Hashima's war crimes. Therefore, this company... ...plans to bury you in the mine to destroy all evidence. Everyone! Tell me! -Who do you trust? -You bastard! That old geezer is a real fox. Listen up, everyone! Park Mooyoung is an independence fighter who came to rescue Yoon Hakchul. But! Can you even believe this? Park discovered that Yoon was Shimazaki's informant. So Yoon shot him with a gun! My goodness! Really? And this here! Written by Yoon and the manager, it lists all of the money they skimmed off your paychecks. People who died of accidents, hunger, sickness, violence! People who died trying to escape. You stole their compensation! This man Lee Gangok! To kiss up to the Japanese, sold his own daughter! What did you say? And that guy, Park Mooyoung! Is completely unknown to us, coming from who knows where! That's right! How do we know Gangok and that newbie aren't spies? Calm down! All of us need to band together! Let's keep our heads and not be fooled! These unknown guys coming in and slandering our Mr. Yoon. I saw it too! Put down the gun, now! Our men are on the way. I saw it! I saw you shot him and Chungho! Jangwoo, have you been bought off too? Why betray your own country? Do you really have to sell me? Stop it, Jangwoo! How could you do it too? What if I show you this? 4088 Yoon Hakchul. This is your ID number torn off by the dead Chungho! Don't be fooled by appearances. They're deceiving you. -I saw it too! He's a bad man! -That girl saw such an awful thing? First, let's look at those documents. Yeah! This is nuts! You need to prove what they say isn't true. Ito Takamichi! Yoon Hakchul! That money you worked for... ...is the Japanese dirty money! Guilty of treason. That money was for Korean independence! Was that so wrong? Guilty of bleeding the people dry! It's not my own independence! Guilty of pretending to lead, and deceiving the people! You fools! For betraying the nation... You think killing me will bring liberation? I punish you in the name of Korea! After all I've done! So what are we going to do? No one's ever managed to escape here. Think we can all just hold hands and leave? Yoon has always tipped off the manager. That's why they failed. If we take the coal transport ship in the harbor... -...we can succeed. - Wait a minute. Who's gonna drive that big ship? Hold on, we got a few boatmen here. I've sailed fishing boats. I know the route, so with 5 or 6 men to row... Hold on! That freight ship is not a fishing boat! It's not just that, if we all run for it... ...won't they start shooting and stabbing us? -What then? -That's true. The guards who come to Hashima were all judged unfit for the battlefield. And after the bombing, they're still spooked. There are much more of us. And we got military training... Instead, how about we try negotiating with the Japanese? Right! To be honest, Japanese are more enlightened than us. -If we try dialogue... -Dialogue my ass! If they were sensible, would we be living this way? Remember the Kanto Earthquake? They spread rumors that... ...Koreans poisoned the wells, and massacred all Koreans! You say that because you have skills and lived easy! Who says I lived easy? You're just trying to divide us, painter! Hey! Just decide who'd leave or stay! -This is wasting time! -He's right! Those who want to go, can go. Those who will stay, stay. You really think they'd kill so many people? -Right? -Yeah! Daddy, aren't we going? Damn it, I'm gonna blow my top! You stupid Koreans! If you made it this far, shouldn't you try to live? Have you all grown so used to being stepped on? This girl and I want to live! We'll go ourselves. Wait! I'll go too. I lost my leg and became a cripple. But I won't let them bury me here. But Malnyeon, what if they really kill us all? Even if just one of us survives, we win. Just one. My life was ruined, but I won't die in their hands. Wait! I'll go too. Are you really staying? How can you trust them? You should think it over. Come on, we'll try talking to the Japanese! Let's go! There's no time, so we won't try to persuade you. Are you crazy? What's going on? You telling them of our plan is only trouble. So please understand. And besides... ...it'd be best if they found you tied up. Don't need this! Damn you, Jangwoo! Careful, careful... Wait, I don't see Choi Chilseong's gang. If they tell the labor attendant... They said they're going to rescue Choi. What? What will they do then? Let's hurry. Boss! What are you doing here? They say they'll put you on trial or whatever, ...but let's go before things get worse. Think of this as a drill, like in training. We're going to move in groups from now on. When we're ready, women, the wounded and children will move first at our sign. Our final goal... ...is to cross the coal belt over the wall... ...board the ship and escape. This is dynamite they prepared for the mine. Explosives team, tie them to the lantern batteries. It will strengthen the blast. The wounded, use tatami mats to make shields. Malnyeon and the women will make rope from fundoshi underwear. Weapons team, take tools and oil from the tool factory. Lee and his band will gather bottles for bottle bombs. Those who can steer the ship, help me take control. The rest of you, wait for our signal. It's dangerous, don't touch! Why are you only scolding me? Why are you here? If you're ready, I'll bring everyone. Don't do this, come with us. You really think 400 people can sneak onto a ship? With all those wounded people? Then do you want to start a war here? We'll all die tomorrow anyway. If you try to kill Jonggu, you'll die too! Hey. Did Park Mooyoung go without finishing them off? They weren't here before. Damn it! Who's there? It's me! Me! Shishido, it's me. Yamamura! Why are you out so late? Go back inside. I can't believe it either. Quickly get over here! With the big event tomorrow, Yamada said to bring the girls and pour everyone a drink. Since you guys have it hardest, I brought some girls, you know? Really? Where's the alcohol from? Shimazaki had it stashed away, and Yamada took it out. Just one drink for each of you. If it's just one, better not to have any. We'll give it a taste. Come this way. Bro! Quickly! Women and the wounded first. Can we really do this? I don't see any guards. I spent so much on Korean girls. If the manager finds out he'll be mad. Who will know we started the fire? They'll think the Koreans kicked over a candle while they were sleeping. Out of the way! Go back! Hey, it's women and the wounded first! I'm wounded too! And she's a young girl, shouldn't we board first? Bro! Don't you have any shame? Take a look at these people! Damn it. Then at least let Sohee go first. No! Get up there, kid! The sun will be up soon. If you see a cripple go, you can follow, right? You'll be fine if you follow me, so you come next. ♪ Doonggae, Doonggae, My dear Doonggae. ♪ My baby Doonggae... ♪ I am afraid of him being caught. ♪ Don't cry, Doonggae. ♪ Will he ride in on the wind? ♪ Will he ride in on the clouds? ♪ Come without a sound. ♪ Come without a trace. ♪ We wanted to be together ♪ We wanted to live as one ♪ If not in this world, ♪ I'll meet you in the next world.

I'll join you, so you go first. I keep my promises. As they board the ship, we'll watch their backs. You guys in the front, move! The Koreans started a fire! The Koreans are escaping! Over there! Check the back! Quickly! People at the back, stop moving! Snipers! Explosives! Hold on! It's a real war! Kill every last one of them! You rotten bastards! Sohee, stay right here! Kill every one of them! That way! Let's go home! I said this would never work! From the very start! Sohee! Hide, quickly! Go back, you! It's dangerous here! Lift! With all your strength! Go over the wall and into the water! Snipers and explosive team, move! The rest of you, lift! Light them here! Let's fight to the death! One, two, three! Daeyeob! One, two, three! Lift it! Lift it! Lift! Sohee, hide here! Follow me, guys! Bring this! Help me! Spread it out! Spread it out! Throw! Grab the rope and follow me! Bullets! I'm out of bullets! Bayonets! Charge! Bastards! We don't deserve this! Daddy! Get back there Sohee, it's dangerous! Pull the rope! Pull out! Chilseong, you bastard! Come back here, bastard! Pull it back, quick! Pull it back! What are you holding back for? Move! Pull the rope! Pull! Now push it! A little more! Lift it up! Push! That's it! Climb up! Everyone climb up! Let the wounded climb up! Sohee, where are you? Daddy! Hey! Come on, guys! Get up! Bastard! Sorry for not keeping my promise. You can rest now. I'm on your side! Kill all the Koreans, whatever side they're on! -Bro! What do we do? -Keep climbing! Sungil! Sungil! Sungil! Sungil! Yamamura! Sohee, stay there! Stay there! Daddy! Daddy! I've got you now! Dirty Koreans! Damn you! Why aren't you grateful? Why! It's all over now! Your manager! Your supervisor! And Yamada is dead! Now we're going back... ...to our home! Daddy! I'm not going to die. Why are you crying? Stop! Go over there, Sohee. I'm older, so let me ask you a favor. Sohee... Give her some soy noodles with sugar. That's what she likes best. My girl... Please look after my girl. Sorry I couldn't give you anything. Don't... Don't turn your nose up at raw eggs. Sing a song for me. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! You said you wouldn't die! You promised! Daddy! "1945, August 9th, 11:02 AM, Nagasaki" Oh my gosh. Look at that. A lot of Koreans live there too. "Hashima Coal Mine opened in September 1890" "From the 1937 Invasion of China to the end of World War II." "It contributed greatly to Japan's military industrial sector." "In the 1970s, Japan adopted new energy policies," "and closed the mine in January 1974." Look at me! Where are you looking at? Don't just smile and don't be nervous. Answer me. "Battleship Island and Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution," "Became UNESCO's World Heritage Site in 2015." "One of UNESCO's conditions was to post notices about forced labor," "and other historical facts by December 2017," "but Japan has yet to comply." Okay. Two! Three!
