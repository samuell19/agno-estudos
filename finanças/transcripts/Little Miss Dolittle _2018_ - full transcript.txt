- Good morning! - Morning. - Is Lilli awake already? - | Don't know, I'm currently in China. - Good morning sunshine! - Oh, Bonsai, | had such a lovely dream. I'd like to keep on dreaming. Please don't! - No, it's almost 8:00. High time you got going missy. Oops. What's up with you? - | Think | can smell fresh bread around here. What are you waiting for? - Will you come to the party afterwards? - Yeah sure but only after the speeches and the hoo-ha is over. - Is Currywurst suitable? - Currywurst, | love Currywurst. - You two don't have anything planned? The mayor doesn't understand fun. No catastrophes-- - No Armageddon, promise, Mommy. Have fun with the mayor. - Thanks. - Cheers Daddy. - No Armageddon. Or any other catastrophes. - This is my day today. And that's what | see through your camera, Susewind. Beauregard Gockel, the star of this city. The sun that makes you all shine. Hello Anton, how are you? - What's all this? It's a donkey who thinks he's a Unicorn. - | Was just born in the wrong body. - Hey look it’s the crazy Liliane. - She's really talking to a donkey. - Wow that's insane. - Do you see Lilli? People don't understand us. I'm a unicorn and not a donkey. You have to free me. Do something, Lilli, please. - Okay, do you want to let off some steam? Are you in the mood for a race? - Yeah! - Let's go! - Go Lilli, push those pedals, we're counting on you! We're not gonna let that donkey overtake us! Oh Man, look at him go. - Stop, Anton, the fence! - Today there is great excitement in Oberschnepfenheim. Soon Mayor Beauregard Gockel will have his own monument-- - Enough, Susewind, it's all about me. This monument was a personal vision. - Stop, Anton, stop! - Susewind, is this your daughter? - Lilli! - Anton! - Stop immediately! - Stop that animal! - Lill, what are you doing here? - But it depends very much on his monument. - I've got it all under control. - | Wouldn't like to be the one who messed this up. - Get that donkey out of here. - |Amaunicorn. | Have magical powers and, and diarrhea. - Susewind, in 24 hours | want you gone! - And this is not the way it's going to carry on. This is my seventh termination so far. This is the fifth time we've moved in not even how many, three years. Every time she talks to animals, everything goes down the drain. | Mean, this is our life as well. I'm sorry but we are going to have to tell her to stop this nonsense. - The Chinese Empress stood before the ruins of her palace-- - Ferdinand, I'm serious about this. What will we do if | can't find another job? The money that you earn with your books is not enough for us to Survive on. - Then she took her husband, the Emperor, in her arms, | love you, she said, and that is more than enough for me to live. - Oh Ferdi. - Can | please speak to you guys? | Swear, on my honor, | will never again speak to animals. Except to Bonsai. - Well that goes without saying, you know. Ll look for some real friends, children. - Would you really do that for us? - From now on nobody will know who | really am. - Isn't this promise of yours a little too big? - So, did | promise you too much? - Ls this our new house? Bonsai, Bonsai? Wake up, wake up! Wake up! From today I'll be normal, stunningly normal. Well, how do | look? - We're not, boring? - Then it's exactly right. Daddy, hey, Daddy! This is the tub. - Oh. Ah, | see. - The bedroom's not here anymore. - Next to the kitchen. And | was already wondering. So this is not the? - The corridor. - The corridor. - This was the last move, you promised Daddy. - Good morning. - Morning. - Morning. - Oh, coffee, and, how did you sleep? Well, | feel fantastic. That said, | would feel fantastic if | just had this day behind me. Oh. \Imm. Perfect. And how do | look? - Totally bossy. - Bossy is good. And you look very school-like. Should | take you with me? - Sure, why not? - Good, come on then. - Cheers, Pops. - Just a minute, what about me? - You're just aS normal as me now. You do dog things and look for bone stashes. - | Don't think so. - Do you think we can do it? That is, me with my new job and you with your friends? - You mean children, no crapping donkey? - Exactly. Or a crocodile in the children's wading pool. Well | think that you can do it. I'll cross my fingers for you! - Hey, I'll take care of you. - Hey Bonsai, | said you can't come with us! - In a strange city lurking on every corner there's great danger. - Look there, that one, is she new? - Danger on the right. - Oh my god, girls, the dwarf is so cute! | Have to stroke it! That's so sweet. - Sweet, this dog is made of stee! Tough and definitely no dwarf! - Don't worry he's very nice. He understands totally who's in control when it, comes to Currywurst being available or dry dog food. - That's extortion! - Now you can pet him. - With pleasure. - Laura, me first! - Wow babe, is that perfume or what? - That's enough. Are you coming to us In 6b? The clothes don't work, but the dog is sweet! If you fit in, maybe you can join my clique. - If you fit in. - Besties, we're going. - That includes you too. - She doesn't say that twice - You don't really want to? - And what if | do, | promised Mama. | Have to look for normal friends. - So this is how it Is. In two days it's my 12th birthday and Daddy's throwing a party for me. It's all arranged. And if you've proven that you're worthy of being my girlfriend, then I'll invite you too. - | See youre all looking forward to this week's project. - To muck out the stables - You'll see, it's more than that. Much more, Trixi. But before you leave, | would like to introduce you to a new classmate, Liliane Susewind. - Susewind. - Um, people just call me Lill. - Welcome to our school, Lilli. However, you will not spend the next few days here, but rather with Colonel Essig. Most of you already know Dr Essig-Steinmeier. - Attention. - This is the most extraordinary woman in our city, Lilli. - Colonel Essig. And you'll spend the next three days in her even more extraordinary Zoo. - I'm sorry? - Oh boy, that does not sound good. - This is not a Zoo, we do not lock anyone up! It is a home for two, four, six, eight-legged. Or one, three, five, seven, nine-legged. Or multi-legged or non legged. Anyway, um, what is it | want to do? - The reopening. - Ah, and you can help me with, with the, the uh? - Refurbishing. - With the refurbishing and reopening. Well then, come on. - Break it up friends, have fun. - Come guys. - Three days no math. - Have fun, you too, have fun. What's wrong, Lilli, what are you waiting for? - Can't | rather do something else? - But this Is project week, it's for everyone. And besides there's no school for three days, aren't you happy? - Yes, but I'm not very good at Math, maybe | should just study at home? - Listen up Lilli, you're new here. And this is the best chance for you to make friends quickly. And now watch out that the others don't leave without you. Lll just need to go home to get my bike. - Uh wait, you Know what just take mine. And tomorrow you'll come with yours, okay? Have fun, Lilli. - If this goes well. - Oh my god, that's cool. - Please, like after you. - Ah, this smells of witches and hell. - Stinking creepy worms! - The bikes will stay outside. - Everyone else come inside. - Compulsory education is what it is, Besties? - Why don't you go in? - Um. - Liliane! - | Just don't like animals! - Well finally. - Here you are at last. - Who is that? - He's Oberst's nephew. He got us into the project week here. - Emma, Emma, wake up! | Have bubligum, this ts still allowed. - Welcome to Paradisia, yes. Follow me! - Emma they're going! Just because you don't come from here! Wait, here's the hottest show of all times! - Hey, hello hello hello! Come inside young lady, the show is about to start! Today I'm this, tomorrow I'm that, the day after I'll fetch Queeny's child! - Unless | Know what you call a dwarf. - Catch that Rumpelstilskin! - That's not fair, I'm not the murderer. That's the gardener of course, the gardener, the gardener. You must believe me. - What are you doing there? - Nothing. - Come on, it stinks like fish What are we supposed to do here? My dad said you're broke. - Uh, no for now, at the moment we're closed. - For now? - What, uh, for a year. But in three days we open again with a big bang. - Lil-Ann, yes, that's your name from today. Lil-Ann, so much cooler than Liliane. Hold on to me and youll survive the whole thing here. - Oh look at him, he's so cute! - Are you all still here? Or have animals disappeared again? - What? - Like the kangaroo or the turtles. More and more animals keep disappearing and no one knows where. Look after your selves. - | Don't believe It. - What do you mean? - Wow, what disgusting critters walk around here. - Oh, that's cute. - Oh no, please don't. - Actually, I'm magical. L_ili-ane! The day before yesterday the mayor would have fricasseed me by a hair. But the Colonel saved me. - Lil-Ann? - Lill-ane, we know each other. | Am-- - Psst! - The Unicorn! - Lil-Ann, he's crapping! - Come on, let's go fast. | Can't stand the noise here. - But you have to help us. Animals are being stolen from here. J In Paradisia, I'm most fond of the penguins J JS Donkeys and elephants J J And ask me why # J | ask you, where is there a better place J J Here in the whole country J J | like every human and every animal J JS Paradisia is my home Jf f I'll stay here forever J s Just like all the stables here J - Uh, that is Toni, my dearest. My best, my most beautiful Zookeeper. And the sou] of Paradisia. He saved little Ronnie from-- - But Doctor Essig, you yourself have-- - Uh, no false modesty, Toni. Be so good and show the children Ronnie. If anything, I'll be with the poisonous snakes. Brushing teeth. - And what is Ronnie now? - That you will soon see. Come along with me. But please stay behind me. And please do me a favor, be nice and quiet because Ronnie is still a baby. - There he is! - Ronnie, Ronnie, you don't have to be scared. The children here are very happy to meet you. - | Thought you didn't like animals? - | Need a picture of this. - Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? - A selfie you clown. - Go away, leave me, please leave. - Come on sweetie. - Help, Mom! - Don't be like that sweetie! - | Want to be with my mom! - Now stop pretending. - What is this? What is this? - Hey guess what, Ronnie has acold, come with me. - Trixi! - Just leave me alone! - | Hope that was a lesson for you, animals are not toys. They are just like you and beings like you and me. - Where is Ronnie's mom’? - That's a very good question. You're a really concerned animal lover aren't you'? - Yeah well, | mean | don't matter. - Martha is sick. She's, uhm, Martha ts in the hospital so that she won't infect the little one even more. So in three days there's a grand opening and until then there's still a lot to do around here, and yes, you want to help me get everything ready to go? Yeh, yeh sure! - Then I'll tell you about all that needs doing. - You know it really looks like my new job is a real stroke of luck. There's this zoo which is about to go bankrupt. And they want me to draw attention to it with a report. You know, all we have to do now is hope that Lilli gets on well. And most of all that she finally makes some friends. - Come on, say it, I'm up for that. Lilli you Know I'm your best friend. - | Know, that's you. But | have to find some human friends. - Is it happening? - Sure, | even have a new nickname, Lil-Ann. - | Think that's weird. - Oh yeah? Do you remember the other nicknames? Spinnianne, witch dumbass or even the madman! | Just never thought it would be so hard not to talk to animals. - You can talk to me if it helps. - Thank you, Bonsai! But the problem is that | heard something. A piglet in the Zoo was very scared. - Mmh, alarm, enemy spy! Zip your lips Lilli! - He's in there, | can smell him, Lilli. - Are you sure? - Should | go in for you? Then you'll see him only again in heaven. - No thanks, you stay here and stand guard. | Have to ask the guy a few questions. - Are you spying on me? - Me, who's just been sneaking up on who? - Oh yeah? And what do you want? - | Want to know why you were listening in on me. - Why do you say you don't like animals. | Don't believe a word otf it. - Oh yeah, and what about you? Why are you hiding here with all this stuff? - Does this concern you? Tell me what the animals say to you! - | Can't do that. - Then go away, come on, go. - Okay, but you first. That's the deal, otherwise I'll go. - All right then. | Don't want anyone to know how | really am. I'm a freak, | mean gifted. Everything that's normal bores me to death. - Do you walk backwards sometimes? - And | hang from the ceiling. - While you're building these awesome things that you could actually buy everywhere. - But you're done out there when you're like me. And | just can't help it. - You mean because you're different? | Understand you well, and | won't tell anyone, | promise. - Thank yo. But now you. - No | can't do that. - That was our deal What are you trying to hide? - |'M like you. | Don't walk backwards, but I'm also a freak. | Can talk to animals. - | Knew itt! - | Know it sounds crazy. - | Mean, especially for a man of science, but. What did she say? - Hello I'm Lilli. Is there anything you want to say to Jess? First of all she wants to apologize for messing up Granny Else's knitting. And then she say's you're a stinker. That you haven't changed your socks for the last what, five days? - It's no more than three. The left one has three holes at the tip of the toes. - Okay, | believe you. You couldn't have guessed something like that! And that's why you have to tell me what the piglet said. - There are animals disappearing. A kangaroo and two turtles. The piglet was really worked up, it was scary. - That's why my aunt is so worried. Lilli, we have to help her. - No, we don't Know anything about it. | Did not hear anything. | Promised my mom not to talk to animals anymore. Whenever | talk to animals, everything goes wrong. - You can't be serious LIilll. - |'M keeping my promise. I'm keeping my promise! - Emma, stop already, you are the queen! My gosh, we want to perform Snow White but how am | supposed to kiss you and protect you from the witch? - No, not me, I'll start crying. Help, ass, oh, ass, mayday! - | Knew it, it was the gardener. It's the gardener! - Now just the main prize is missing. Colonel Essig. Colonel Essig, Colonel Essig! - No! - | Mean, Dr. Essig of course. - Please dont tell me it's happened again! - Indeed, and I'm so sorry, this time, this time it's our Rumpelstiltskin. This while all the gates are locked and no enclosures broken into, | just don't understand it. First our Kangaroo, then our turtles. And now Colonel, Doctor Essig? - From now on we keep watch, we take turns. And not a word to the children. A half empty park. Nobody should know that before the reopening, Toni. - Of course not. Look at Oberst, daring to go out like that? - What's going on here? - Nothing. - Nothing? - You're to do exactly what | told you yesterday. Paradisia Is to open with lights and stars. - And what's with the rifle? - | Don't know what you mean. - Lil-Ann, are you coming? - Yes, in a minute. - My aunt has a rifle. - Oh yeah, that's just a dart gun. The main square needs to be swept. - Lil-ann | thought you wanted to be one of us. - Yeah, of course I'm coming. - No, that's not going to work. Toni has assigned her to me. Come on | have to talk to you. Something stinks here. And Toni and my aunt are keeping it secret from everyone. Did you hear that? Come, come with me! - No, leave me! - We have to find out what's going on, you have to eavesdrop on them. - My Rumpelstiltskin, | wanted to be your Snow White. Who has kidnapped you? - What's she saying? - Stolen from my side in the middle of the night. - What are you doing there, have you got nothing to do? - Yes auntie, we're just leaving. There was only one penguin, where's the other? - Psst, come with me! We need to talk somewhere else where no one can hear us. Okay, Queeny says that Rumpelstiltskin was kidnapped. - And my aunt knows it, that's why she has the rifle. - And she thinks the thief is coming back. - Or she wouldn't still be Keeping watch. - Exactly. - Where are you going? - The thief wants more and what is the most valuable animal here in Paradisia? - Ronnie. - Agreed. And he's alone, watch out that nobody comes and sees what | do. Hello, Ronnie. | Would like to talk to you. - No, please go away. - But why, what are you afraid of? - Like any animal, la la la la la. - My mom says there are always animals disappearing at night, and now she's gone. And |'m all alone. - That's why I'm here. I'll Keep an eye on you. Just as Toni will make sure your mother gets well again. - Our Ronnie here, la la la la la. - Crap, it's Toni. We have to get out of here. - No, please don't go. - | Promise that I'll come back. - Really, you promise? - | Promise you, Ronnie. - You have to go now, come! - What's with Toni, do you trust him’? - Sure, Toni loves Ronnie more than anything. | Mean maybe we should tell him. - Absolutely no way. Nobody should know that | can talk to animals. - You promised Ronnie that you would protect him. - Yes, | did, and | will, I'll protect him. We'll both protect him, Jess. We'll find out who the animal thief is, come on! The penguin was stolen at night Ronnie's mom said the same thing. The thieves come at night. So we need to protect the animals at night. - Get down! But there aren't enough of us for that. Two of us can't guard the whole zoo. - | Know, and | know who we'll ask to help. Hey look who's here. - What do you want? - We need your help. - Oh yeah, and what for? - Oh no, it's my mother. She can't see me here and you'll have to entertain the girls, please! What, no way, that's not happening, hello? - Please! Oh, it's the TV people and | haven't done my hair! | Can't be filmed like this. - No, Lilli! - Well girls that's why | always tell you, look perfect anywhere, anytime! Hi good afternoon, I'm ready for the interview. - Uh, yeah, good. You, would you like to come too, good. - And what do you think? - | Don't know, it looks somehow even stranger - It's all the same to me. | Mean, besides you there's never been anyone else here. And now all the worst kids in the school, the world! - Hey, have you guys... Cool barn. Have you seen this? - We should all follow the example of these children. Lets help Paradisia. Let's make sure that this charming place-- - Take that out immediately! | Will sue the TV people! Why are you all looking so stupid? If you find it as corrosive in here as | do, then let's go to a place where we won't get a rash. - Animals are being stolen from Paradisia. - So who cares? - And we think Ronnie is going to be next. - And that's why we're going to meet in the zoo tonight and guard him. - Tonight? Are you crazy. - Stop! - Please don't! Oh - No! , My gosh! - I's no wonder you hide out in here, you freak. | Hope it's not contagious. Girls, let's go. - Actually | think it's pretty cool. - So | see. - And that, any elephant Is so cute. - If someone Is really going to steal, then we should help right? - Well then I'll put it another way. Which of you do not want to come to my party? Anna, Frieda? - But Trixi, we need everyone, | thought we were gonna be friends. Stop, you want to be my friend. And my friends do what | want. Anna? - Sorry, Trixi, I'm coming. - Me too. - And what about you, Lauralein? You can also be the first in the make-up salon. This is the highlight of my party! - Thanks, but | want to help Lilli and Jess. - Okay, you are out! And you! And you! For you the party has died. - Okay, shoot, what are you gonna do? - We're going to sneak out tonight. We'll meet at nine in front of the Zoo. - Hello, Vanessa? - Toni, my little muffin Toni! You let me wait, | can hardly stand it without you. - That's for the penguins, | always have one in my pocket. - That's disgusting Toni. And at the same time so pathetically sweet. Will you dance with me? - Yes. - You love that. Soon there will only be me, and you. You just have to do another tiny thing for me. - Everything you want, Vanessa, | love you. | Love you almost as much as little Ronnie. - Uh wait, we'll drink on It. To little Ronnie. - Miss. - Ls it time for the transfer, Toni? - Ahem, yes, and | brought you something, you probably didn't have any breakfast. - Breakfast? - It's a cheese pizza with banana, jam, bacon, and chocolate cream, the whole thing is a pizza a la Toni. - Thank you - Bon appetit. - Thanks. If | didn't have you Toni. I'm so tired, Toni. | Think | need a big hat full of sleep. - Sleep well Doctor Essig. - Good night, Toni. - And don't be scared I'll keep an eye out like a hawk. - Good night, Mama! You don't need to see me to bed, I'm absolutely exhausted. Now, lets get to the ladder Bonsai. - Stop, wait, she's coming! - How so, was your day so exhausting? You'll let all the mosquitoes inside. - Ohl! - No. - Well bravo, there goes the ladder. - Never mind I'll fix the handle tomorrow when | do the windows. And, how was school today? - Great, why? - Well half of your school was out at Paradisia and | thought that-- - Yeah right. We have project week, but luckily I'm at another place. - That sure was lucky. | Mean, imagine that you had to spend the whole day at the zoo and could not talk to the animals even once. That would have been terrible. And, how about your new friend, is everything all right? - Er, yes everything's great. She's having a huge party on her birthday. - Hm, very nice. All right, then sleep tight and have sweet dreams. - Sleep well. - Good night. Mama? - Yes? | Love you very much. So even when sometimes | do stuff that doesn't seem like it. - | Love you very much too. Good night, my heart. - Phew, that was close, but how are we gonna get down? The window Is locked. - Do you know that | feel that this move was the right thing to do. It's kind of like we've finally arrived. - Are you serious, in the middle of the lion's den? - | Feel like we should celebrate. Can you bring us a bottle of wine? - Come on Lilli, let's go! - Not there, on the other side. - | Think I'll die. - How long do you want to stand here? Come on, out with you, go. - Did you say something? - Me? - Bonsal! - Oh | was thinking out loud. | Was wondering if you wanted to know what happened to the empress in her new palace? J My Paradisia, | love you so much 2 f Without you | would not know where to go £ Still you lie here and sleep under the stars J S How is it that | feel so sad Jf J How heavy my heart would be if you could not carry on - Psst, | know that smell. Last time it was egg yolk. - Then you stand guard here. You sound the alarm as soon as you see something. - These are night vision devices | built them specially for us. - Do you also have a cool invention that opens the gate? - Sure, my aunt owns the zoo. | Borrowed it once. - Smelly kids garb. - We don't know if Ronnie is really the next one to be stolen. So we need to keep an eye on as many enclosures as possible. - That's true, we have to distribute ourselves. Give me your phones, go on, go ahead. - Huh? - Laura, you stay here with the penguin enclosure. Jess you oversee the right-hand road. I'll take the left. - Report as soon as you hear something. I've turned your phones into walkie talkies. - Wow. - Let's go, everyone to their posts. - Mama, where are you? When are you coming back’? - Hey, you dont have to be scared, we'll protect you. Can you hear that too? - Okay, now it's getting serious, take cover. - Hello, darling. - There are kids in the Zoo. See to it that they disappear, stinker poops! - Good, yeah, I'm on tt. - Well now you little yappie mutt, what would you rather be? A handbag or furry boots? - | Can't see anything. - I'm with Ronnie, everything's quiet here. - There, there's something with me, it's going toward Lilli. - We were right, it's about Ronnie. - Okay, follow tt. Lilli, I'm coming to you from the other side. But please be careful. Where is it? - Crap, | can't see him anymore. - Are you sure there was something there? - Ha, I've got you! - Toni? - What are you doing here? - Uh I, well, | was lying here waiting because | had hoped the thleves would come. Wait a minute the question is more likely for me, what are you doing here? Do your parents even know you're here? - Yes of course they. - In actual fact, in actual fact we're here because because were protecting the animals. - Oh, kids that's you don't need to do that. It's very nice of you, but this is too dangerous. | Will, I'll take you back to the gate. - But we want to help. - Do you not understand? Lam here, and | am armed. Come on, get going! - What? - Any time now. - But Jess. - I'll grab those guys, | promise you. | Promised that to Dr Essig, too. I'm sorry that | that | have to be so strict with you, but criminal hunting in the middle of the night, that's nothing for kids. - Come on, you can rely on Toni 100 %. - Don't tell anybody that you were here. Certainly not your parents. - |'Ll stick with it, it smells like eggs. - Well done, we've almost made It. Now only the little crown jewel is missing. What are you waiting for? Come on, get me the little elephant. - Uh Vanessa, | don't Know. Maybe Vanessa, |, I've got, I've been thinking. - And since when can you do that, fly-crap? - What do you mean sweetheart? - Think about it you dumbass. - Let me, I'm serious. | Think I'm getting out, you can not have Ronnie. - | Can not have him? | Can not have him. - Um. - | Can not have him. - Um. - Oh, what have | done? You don't love me anymore. - But. - Nol! - Naturally. - Leave me, get away! - But Vanessa, we can still do It. - Get lost. - But-- - Get lost! Or give me a kiss, you like that right? No, on the hand. That's good, you love me, right? - Um. - You'll do what | tell you, you'll eat out of my hand. Everything, even this Little maggot here. That's how It Is. And now Get me the tusked animal, the little Toro. Hurry up you Stinker! - Mhm. - Jess for Lilli, Jess for Lilli. Lilli wake up, they've stolen little Ronnie! - What, I'm coming. How could that happen, Toni was there. - Stop, stop, someone committed a crime here. A tusked animal has been stolen. - We have to get in there. - But you cant do that! - After thorough forensics and evaluation of all available knowledge, we can definitely state-- - The elephant has been stolen. - | Agree, disappeared without a trace. And until that changes, we're sealing this seal, we're sealing this room. - The room and the zoo. And the reopening ceremony will be canceled. - No, you can't do that. - We have to, for security reasons. - Today an elestolen, uh an elephant was stolen-- - And tomorrow tt's a child right? - But then, then we'll be broke, bankrupt. Then I'll have to close Paradisia forever. - But what will become of Ronnie, we have to search for him. - What is she doing here? - |'D also like to know that. - This is no place for little kids but for trained authorities. So get out of here until we've secured all the tracks. - Yes, shoo! - Jess, where are you, Jess! There you are. What are we gonna do now? - | Can tell you that, this zoo is history. No one will be getting fatter anymore and you can stop making yourself important. Because while you, Lil-ann, your nerd friend Jess and this dwarf of a dog watch Paradisia go down, everyone else will be celebrating the coolest party in the world with me. | Expect you all at my home at three. - Mr. Gumnich says the school's closed today. Come on, let's get going. - |'M really sorry, see you later. - How could this happen? Toni was there, he was looking after everything. We must have missed something. The gardener, of course! The murderer is always the gardener. - Huh? - The penguins said it themselves. Man, I've been blind. - The penguins, | don't understand anything anymore. - It is always the one least suspected, the gardener. The wheelbarrow, Toni's wheelbarrow, Toni! He was at the zoo at night and he had all the keys to the enclosures, where is he? - With Ronnie's Mama, in the Animal Hospital. - Where its that? - There, but that's-- - Wait, man, Martha is ill. She must not know that Ronnie was stolen. - Martha, I'm so sorry. | Mean I, | do everything for you, but but you're just getting weaker and weaker. - Where have you been? You promised to take care. - That's what I've done! Here | am depressed, | do not know anything. | Did, | did not see anything, nothing at all. - | Told you it wasn't him. - Something here stinks, | mean it really smells. The man is yellow. - Bonsai Is right, it smells like perfume. - Ooh you understand your dog, can you understand me too? - Yes. - You're my savior, I'm so worried about my little Ronnie. How is he, did you see him? - | Don't know, so | mean, he was, so-- - She's sick, don't you see it? - I'm so sorry. - Lilly! - Ronnie is gone. - How, where is he? Where is my son? - Hey! - Ronnie! - What are you doing here? - We're looking for Ronnie. - He Is not here at all. Martha needs her rest, do you want to kill her?

She can't know he's not there. - We're going home now, come on. - Miss Essig, please Miss Essig. - Martha desperately needs her rest. Isn't it enough, what you've done? - Miss Essig. - | Don't want to see you and your daughter here anymore! Now you go already. - But Aunt-- - Have | made myself quite clear? - Come now we're going. You can trust me, | swear it high and holy I'll never talk to animals again, you lied to me, Lilli. - You're right. | Always try to help and everything goes wrong. - You really have not understood it, right? We were thrown out again. | Do not Know how to continue this with my work now. Really | do not want to have to move one more time, please understand that for once! - Yes but then what about Ronnie? - Well that's something for the police to sort out. - You've seen what idiots they are, they'll never find him! - That's quite enough now. You are under house arrest. And you will not come out until I'm sure that you not a danger for any animals. - Watch out. - Do you think that's enough? - Yeah, we'll find him later in the day. - Yes, if someone except me understands your profile. - Ellfant ripes, his Rame is Nonnie. - Ronnie is that you? Don't be afraid, | love roles like this. Ll chat up the dapper snow lady and then I'll get us out of here. - | Only wanted to read the part. L've never had a more boring tour. - Yes? - Your order is ready. - It took long enough. - Yes, and it'll take still longer. There's still the question of the money, 350,000 shiny ones. | Only like the yellow ones. - Hi, it's me, how's it going? - It's all over. Paradisia will be closed forever. - And the thieves are well gone. - | Was so sure Ton! Was behind this. - Even if we couldn't prove anything. - I'm afraid we can't do anything about it now - But what will become of Ronnie, and the other animals? My mother was right. My gift isn't a gift, it's a curse. - Did she really say that? - No, but she thinks so, and she's right. | Always break everything. And in the end there's no one who still likes me. - You know | think you have more friends than you realize. Forget what | said to you then. That nobody likes you just because you are different. That's not true. - What do you think? - | Mean that a gift is something special. It's a gift you get to help yourself and others. - Yeah, you're right. If you can help someone then you should We're going on a thief hunt. We'll follow Bonsai's trail. He smelled it and it smelled like yolk-yellow. - That's wnat | want to hear! Lilli, tell your mother that you have at least one philanthropist, and he needs a driver. - Mom, Jess asked if | can come over. - | Think | have tt. | Think finally found the right end for my book. The little magic sparrow of the Empress's, do you remember? She released him from his diamond-sparkling cage and kept returning to her. - | Understand, | love you. - And | love the Chinese, downstairs with you! - They're all here, come on, lets rehearse one final time. So first comes the soft music, then the announcement, here comes the most popular girl of the school and city. Then the fireworks and then us. Come on, position, we rehearse one last time. - Nice bike. - Where does that come from? - We're saving Ronnie and Paradisia. - We have an idea, but Jess and | can't do it alone. We need all of you, and especially you Laura! - And | need a Currywurst. - Ladies and gentlemen-- - Come, in position. - Welcome the most popular girl in the city Trixi Goldig. - But where have they gone? Liliane Susewind, you will pay for this. - Put your phones in here. Then I'll make walkie-talkies out of them. - Okay listen, Bonsai put me on the trail, he smelled perfume. Toni smelled like that and the green truck standing in front of the Zoo entrance, remember? And the yellow Cadillac. - The one from the market place? With the drunken aunt in it? - The one who almost ran us over? - | Agree, he smelled like that too. And that's why the aunt has something to do with the thefts. We have to find her. We'll distribute ourselves in the city. How to position ourselves at the most important points. Turn to the guys at the old gate. - Okay, let's go. - Ronja, Lucy and Charlie take the stairs at the marketplace. - And me, Laura and Jess, we'll stay here. We'll track the car as soon as someone discovers it. And Bonsai, where's he got to? He can't eat that much Currywurst. - Now finally be quiet, no one can hear you anyway. - Trixi, Trixi, Trixi, are you kidding? - Do | look like I'm kidding? That Susewind destroyed my party. - No please don't. - Don't you worry, he's almost certainly right there! - If Trixi lets him go. - Okay, I'll go back, I'll get him for you, Lilli. And you, you catch the animal thief! - Thank you, thanks, Laura! - No, help, | can't stand snakes! - Come on film this! Liliane should get really scared.

He won't survive. - Kiss me baby, or have done with me, whichever, but save me do you hear. - You fit perfectly with my outfit, in here. - | Could bite myself in the butt, here's the yellow thing. - He belongs to me! I've got more going with him than one bill's worth, give him to me! - What is this money? - That, you sweet little thing you don't want to know. Is this enough, enough for the mutt?
