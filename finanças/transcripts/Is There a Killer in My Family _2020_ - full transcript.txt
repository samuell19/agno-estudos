Please, no! It hasn't been long. Yeah, no I m telling you it's been four years since our last vacation together. No, because last year we went away on that weekend thing, remember? I mean a vacation. Right. What if I don t even know to vacation anymore? The first step is putting away your laptop. Oooo -kay. Second, is ditching your cellphone. - Come on, give it over. - No. That s a hard no. We re gonna have a sat phone on the island, just in case, you junkie. Can you check e-mails on those things? No, you can t. Okay, so... Okay look, I'm gonna go check in with the captain and pack the boat, if you want to poke in around town. Okay. It s just, it feels, it just feels weird without my laptop. So, I m just going to take that. You know what that feeling is? It s called freedom. You should try it. Great. Don't worry, you can do this. Gorgeous day. Where you from? I m visiting from new york city. Life moves a bit slower out here. Can I help you find anything? - Just browsing. - Okay. You vacationing here? Yeah. Yeah, my husband and I are here the whole summer. I just finished a big project and, well, he has a flexible schedule. He s an actor. An actor? The bryant family murders. That s a really good one. Really? The author figured out who did it! I won t tell you just in case you decide to read it. I already read it. Thank you. I couldn t believe that it was his daughter! I did not see that one coming! So, what s your name? Carly... Travers. My goodness, this is you! My. A real life author in my very own store. What was your name? It s kathy. Kathy, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Wow, they must have been really shocked when they found out it was their daughter. Listen, let me know if you need any help here or if you need anything around town. Thank you. Actually, I do have a question. I m staying on crawford island. Crawford island? Yeah. So you know all about diana crawford? I do. It is quite the mystery. Is this your next book? No, no, I m just vacationing. You should know the crawfords are loved in this town. Absolutely, I didn t mean to intrude. I just wanted some reading material about the island, so... Alright. Well, you can go and see mrs. Palmer over at the library. She can set you up with reading material. Okay. Have a safe trip. Thank you. We re all loaded up, hun. Okay. Bye, internet. Okay! Island's eight acres. Rest of the shore is too steep and rough to dock, so this is the safest place to do it. The only place, really. That'll get you around. We're about two miles out from the mainland. And just go ahead and leave the bags there, I ll give you tour of the place and then I ll come back and get em. Watch your step! Crawford manor was built in 1925 by john henry crawford. John henry was a pleasance bay legend. He left to make it big on wall street and returned some years later to marry the local belle, his high school sweetheart, diana. The manor was a symbol of his love. These days the pleasance bay historical society, we preserve the manor and the island and we rent it out to folks like you to help cover the expenses. Right this way. What s that? It s an old guest house. It's condemned. It's scheduled for demolition at the end of month. Let s go, we re almost there... Welcome to crawford manor. Wow, the pictures online really don't do it justice, right? It's incredible. I think this was a really good idea... Let's go. Look at the sizes of this thing. Is that john henry? The man himself. This place is spectacular. Yeah, it's a big draw for historical buffs, and you know, of course the mystery crowd. The mystery crowd? Alright, let s see this. Lady of the house. You know, the story goes that after a few years of living here, john henry started seeing a shadowy figure on the island, but diana just dismissed it as a figment of his imagination. Well, one night, he went into town and she stayed home. That was the last time he ever saw her. The next morning, her body washed up on shore. She had been strangled. None of the neighbours saw anybody dock a boat or anything, so... The legend is that the shadowy figure killed her. So young, her whole life ahead of her. You actually look a bit like her. Maybe around the eyes? Really? There is actually a bit of a funny connection. I think she s my great grandfather's cousin s wife. But I have to do a little bit more digging. You mentioned you wanted to look into your family history, but you never mentioned this interesting factor. So the police never figured it out? It s a cold case. Well, thank you! My pleasure. You two enjoy! We'll see you in town, captain! Sure thing! You knew the whole time. You knew the whole time and you lied to me. No, I didn t lie to you. Are we even on vacation or are we just here so you can research a new book? I don t even know. You know, what bothers me is that if you d just asked me, I would have said yes. Carly, you know the only reason why I didn't want you to start again is because what happened on the last time that you were on this book- I'm not researching a new book. I m not, I m not. I was just curious about this place and then when you said that you wanted to go away... I just thought we could kill two birds... That s all. Okay, obviously I'm tired, and we've had a long day, and I just... I just think we should have a bath, have a glass of wine and maybe talk about it another time. Okay. - Okay? I love you. - I love you too. Carly! This place is huge. This room is twice the size of our apartment. Can you believe yesterday we were fighting for a spot on the l train, and now it s just the sound of crashing waves on our own private island. This is the summer of us. You, me, crashing waves, and relaxation. That I can get behind. To crawford island. Ahhhhh... How'd you sleep? Good... Except one of the windows came unlatched upstairs and started making a ton of noise. I must've slept right through it. Yeah, you did. This ocean air, I was out like a light... Yeah, and then I stepped on some glass when I was trying to deal with the window. Are you okay? It kind of hurts... Let me see. You cut yourself. The weirdest thing though was that I couldn t find any broken windows, so I don t know where the glass came from. Hold on a second, though. This doesn t look good. Let me see, there we go! There we go! Stop! Stop! We have to stock up on groceries when we head to the mainland today. The mainland? You are really sounding like an islander. It comes very naturally. And, also I m going to spend like an hour at the coffee shop just checking emails and sending out some job applications. You gonna stay here or... No no, I m going to come in. Poke around town. I hear they have a really good library. Well, we re going to set sail through the high seas at midday, my lady. You better be prepared. Wow. That s a good... Pirate impersonation. Have I ever told you, the pirate myth of crawford island? Argh! Well, that wasn't too hard to get here. Hopefully you paid attention because you're driving back. Guess we have cell service again. Yeah. Hey! Hey, there you are! Hey, listen, there was a lady asking about you guys in town last night. Did she leave a name? No. Pretty, brunette. Said she knew you guys from the city or something. You expecting anyone? No one I know. Who even knows we're here? I barely told anyone. If you see her again, will you get her name? Yeah, yeah, will do. Thanks. Hey, look, it s probably someone we forgot we told, okay? Okay. Good luck with your emails. And can you get some wine? Thank you. Of course. Hi, are you mrs. Palmer? I am. I'm carly travers... Kathy told me you were in town and that you might be coming by! News travels fast. There s not a lot of news that happens in this town. You're practically an event. Thank you. I think? No, I m a huge true crime fan and a little bit of an amateur sleuth myself. Really? We have all of your books. Even the first one, "disappearance on route 9". Well, that takes me back. And of course, we have the latest, "the bryant family murders". What an unexpected end. I even watched the whole documentary too, that eldest bryant brother was in total denial about what his sister did. Um, I actually happen to have my own copies of your books here, I was wondering if you wouldn t mind signing them for me? Thank you, that s really flattering. I actually don't sign books anymore. It stopped feeling right. Some of the families are really upset about being written about. They're just sometimes angry at the world and they take it out on me. Well that's unfortunate. Yeah, just, I guess part of the job nowadays. Kathy told me where you're staying... I'm assuming you ve heard about the crawford murder. I have but I would love to know more. It s the great mystery of pleasance bay. Follow me. I have a few things you won't find on any website. Why don't you take a look at this while I go pull some film. Straightforward title. It was written by a local author in the '60's, but never widely circulated. There's a chapter on the crawfords in there. I'll be back in a jiffy. Hello again. Alrighty, these are local newspaper articles from around the time diana died. I figured it was a good place to start. Thank you. Let s get this old beast fired up. Alright... He's here. And I was trying not to scare you. Sorry, I was in my own little world. You, solve the case yet? What s this? You ready? Yup. For real? Yup, yup, yup. I mainly teach now. Carly's the star. Well, that s very exciting. Teaching acting in new york city! Are you at a university? No, it s an academy, but I recently left. I'm... Switching careers. Figuring out what to do next. Yeah, which gave us the chance to come here for a bit of a break. Well, we're happy to have you in pleasance bay. You know, there's some other materials buried in the back somewhere - records and such. I'll dig through them and see what I can find for you. Really? I mean, I can look through them myself. No, I m happy to do it. It'll give me something to do other than dust. Check back with me in a day or two and I ll let you know what I find. Great. So what's the story so far? I don't want to fight. No, I mean it must be so compelling that you can't stay away. So tell me, share with me, what have you found? Kevin. You know the last family actually you, right? Remember when steven bryant actually hit you with a crowbar and smashed your arm. You never know who you're going to piss off by digging around with stuff like that and I can t believe that you are starting this again! You know what? You need to stop. Stop what? Writing? No, you need to stop with the true crime stuff. Just try writing fiction or something for once Fiction? Kevin, you don t get it. These are real people s lives, okay? Just because they re not here anymore doesn t mean that they don t deserve our help. I just don't want you to get hurt again. I don t think that s what this is about. Of course, that's what this is about! No, I don t think it is. Alright. Well, look if you re trying to say something, why don t you just say it? I don t think we were having problems my book was a bestseller... You think I m jealous. You think this is about me? Carly, you didn't sleep for months when you were researching the bryant murders. You actually screamed murder in your sleep. It was taking control over you. These things consume you. Why don't you see that? Okay, stop it. Excuse me, I m so sorry. Are you carly travers? - Yeah... - Hi. My god, I m such a big fan. Are you serious? I've read every book. You know, you really put yourself into the work. I feel like I'm right there with you when you're solving all the cases. It s amazing. Thank you... I've learned so much from you. Like how to track down suspects and persons of interest. That's how I found you. What? Are you impressed? Look, it was really nice meeting you, but carly and I need to be going. You're kevin, aren't you? I'm really sorry you lost your job. Was it voluntary or just... You know... I m gonna leave now, okay? Could you please sign this? She doesn't sign books... You know what? It s okay. I ll do it quick... Thank you!! Thank you. See you again! You know, I still don't understand how she knew I got laid off... I don t know. Fans are a resourceful bunch of people. Yeah, I mean, she seems harmless though, right? I don t know. Hey, at least we have our own private island. Helps keep the stalkers at bay. Where you going? Hey! Carly! I could have sworn I just saw... A woman in a white dress... A woman in white? Where? I don t know, I... Sorry, let s go inside. You got up early. Couldn't sleep. Look, yesterday... I m, I m sorry. Same. I'm going to go to town in a little bit. I'm just going to stick around here. Okay. Just making sure... You re okay? Yeah. I can't believe you found all this stuff. Well, never throwing anything out finally paid off. Ooh, there's john henry. Captain of the swim team. Here's something neat I found. I haven t seen a lot of photos of the manor from back then. Wait a second. I think that's charles travers. There's names on the back. It is! That's my great-grandfather. He was john henry's cousin. I didn't realize he was close with the crawfords. Wait, you re to the crawfords? Yeah, that s why I m interested in this case. Okay, well on a grim note, here s a copy of diana's autopsy report. I've never seen one of these before. Death was asphyxiation. Most likely strangulation. All neighbors confirmed that she was alone on the island. Maybe john henry never left the island? No? I found an article here that went over his alibi from that night. Witnesses say that they saw him all over town - hitting up the pubs, schmoozing with the town council. The boat never left pleasance bay dock. Did anything ever come about regarding the figure, the shadowy figure john henry claimed he kept seeing? No, not in anything that I saw. I know it s been a very long time, but do you think there s anyone in town who might have known the crawfords, who s still around? The only person I can think of is louise bellak, kathy's mother. Kathy - from the antique shop? Yeah, they live above the store. Yeah. She wasn t that keen on me looking into the crawfords. I don t know how much she d love me interviewing her elderly mother. Let me give louise a call and see if she's up for a visit. We could bypass kathy altogether. Thank you. And there s a separate entrance to the residence, from out behind the store. Well, I like the way you think. What was it that you said in the intro to the bryant murders, "truth is the only peace for the unsolved murdered." Mrs. Palmer told you not to tell my granddaughter about your visit? She did, yes. Kathy doesn't like me talking about crawford island. She s friends with john henry's great nephew, he helped finance the store. They're still very influential in town. So we'll keep our voices low. I worked in a dress shop down the block. Diana used to come in after they moved to the island. And what was she like? Warm. Friendly. We talked sometimes, about life. He broke diana's heart when he left for wall street. So they broke up? But he came back and built the manor to try and win her back. Well, it worked and they got married. But then he left on one of his overseas trips. He d be gone for months. He lost his money near the end. Fired all the servants and then left diana alone on that island. And she stayed with him because she was in love with him? She never loved him as much after he left the first time... I think she wanted to leave, but never got the chance. You know, there s something familiar about your face. What did you say your last name was? Travers. My great grandfather, charles travers, was actually john henry's cousin. I actually just learned that he d visited the island. Did you know him? He... No... Are you alright, louise? I'm suddenly very tired. Kathy's taking me to Wednesday service soon. I really should rest beforehand. Absolutely. Thank you for chatting with me. Great. Hi, I'm sorry. I was just- Mrs. Palmer sent you, didn't she? I don't want to cause any trouble. I just wanted to chat with your mum really quickly. About the crawfords, right? My mother doesn't need to be bothered and neither do the crawfords. Stirring up trouble where there is none. It's not good for her health. I understand. I'm sorry for the disturbance. Have a great evening. The last thing pleasance bay needs is someone like you dragging our town through the mud. Understood. My gosh, I am so sorry. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. We've all been there, right? Sorry, I was a little distracted. Good book? Yeah, it s just some research... You re that author that everybody s been talking about.. You're staying out on crawford island? Yeah, I m carly. I'm lauren, nice to meet you. I live on an island across from you. I ve never actually been to crawford though. I guess if you're from here, you never really bother to see it. Well it s beautiful, if you want to stop by. We haven't had any guests yet, so you re welcome to. Yeah, I'll have to. I've heard so many crazy stories. Tell me about it. Look, I gotta go but it was really nice meeting you. Yeah, good luck with your book! I'll see you soon! Thanks! Bye. I think we should explore the island tomorrow. Go on a hike or something. Yeah, that sounds nice. Can we do that in the afternoon though? I just want to did into everything I got from the library, it s a lot. Tell me something. Does this stuff make you happy? Or miserable? A bit of both. Do I make you happy or miserable? Of course you make me happy. I m sorry, I... I get it, when I'm fixated on a story, it's like I can go away and leave you alone on an island. All by yourself. I m sorry. God, am I the john henry of this story? No. Relax. No, you're way hotter. Thank you. You do make me happy. You do. Hey! Hey! Ready to go for a hike? I just found these old boxes, there s tons of stuff in here. I have to go through it. Alright, so you re not coming. Do you mind? Have fun. Diana, my love. Being separated from you for such a lengthy time is a torture I hope to never endure again. I cannot bear one more sunrise without you. The profundity of my love is matched only by the way in which your absence consumes me. I long for the day when this will all be over. My dear, sweet charles. Your last letter was truly a gift, easing the hardship of our distance, your tender words are like music to me. As the months float by, his sway becomes more resolute. As the stars glisten over the bay, my only solace is knowing you gaze upon the same night sky. I will be there soon. Yours, diana. What happened to you diana? Well hi there, pretty lady. It s just me, don t worry. I did not hear you come in. So, I found some stuff upstairs. Yeah, you did. What is this? Love letters. A full box of them. Look at this. Diana, my love... Look who signed it. C. A. Travers. Travers?! Charles travers, my great-grandfather! So he was writing sweet nothings to the wife of his... Cousin. Right? Scandalous, I know. Diana was having an affair? Yeah, it looks like it. Which could have given john motive to kill. So you think it was john henry? The thing is, john did have an alibi. So, I don t know, maybe this gives charles motive? Maybe she rejected him? I don t know where he was the night that she was killed. Maybe he was an obsessed lover? Could be. Look at you getting all intrigued by the mystery. This place has great stuff. I mean, I saw some even better ones down the street. This is kevin. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great. That's nice to hear. That's right, I'll make it happen. I'll figure it out. No, thank you. Thank you very much, I will see you soon. Okay, bye. That was h.P. Acting studios. And? They have an opening. That's great! Yeah, it doesn't start until the fall, but they wanna fill the position by the end of the week. Problem is, the only interview slot they have is for tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning?! Yeah. Well, if you want to do it then let s go get your stuff. Hold on, are you gonna be okay by yourself? Yeah, of course. You sure? Of course. This is a big opportunity for you. I ll be here when you get back. I will see you tomorrow afternoon. And we can toast to your new job. It's just an interview. No, I have a good feeling about this. I love you, you know that? Yeah, I love you, too. I just want to make sure you know that before I take off. You're going to new york, not war, kevin. It s pretty much the same thing, right? He's starting to believe that the imaginary figure in the woods is just his imagination. We have nothing to worry about. Bedtime. Hey! Hey! This is private property! Stop! Hey! Hello?! I m fine. Hi. Hi! Hey, lauren, right? Sorry, I wasn t sure if you could hear me, so I was knocking pretty loud. Yeah, sorry, I, I, I wasn t expecting anyone. I just thought I d drop by. Umm... It might have been my imagination, but last night I thought I heard a scream across the bay. Are you okay? Yeah, I... I thought I saw something, and then... It was nothing. Nothing? Yeah. Thank you for coming by. Yeah, um... Listen, I don t want to be any trouble, but I would really kill for a cup of coffee before I head back. Yeah, absolutely! Yeah? Come on in. You ve got a lot going on here. I am starting to make progress, yes. It's always the husband, isn't it? Sadly, more often than not. You married? I've been with someone for a while, but we haven't taken that step yet. Is your husband going to be back soon? I'd love to meet him. Yeah, actually he ll be back very soon. So this is going to sound... Um... A couple times when I've been passing on my boat, I've could ve sworn that I saw a woman here. A woman? Wandering in the trees in a white gown? I don't believe in ghosts but... No one was supposed to be living here, and... You think that I'm crazy. No, I don't. You ve seen her too? Yes, I have. That s what I was so afraid of last night. I thought I saw her near the path, to the cliffs, right? I thought I was imagining it. I know, right! Do you want me to show you exactly where I saw her? Yes, please. Okay. It was this way, over towards the cliffs. Yeah, that s exactly where I thought I saw someone last night. Is that why you screamed? I just didn t know what I was looking at. Let me show you exactly where I saw her. Sure. Carly! Kevin, over here! My husband needs to hear this, you ll show us both. Okay, sure. I ll be right back. Kevin! Hey! I am so happy you are back. Lauren came by and she told me that she saw the woman in white. Who? She s gonna show us where. Lauren?! Who is this woman? I met her in town the other day, she lives on one of the islands. Lauren?! She was here just now? Yeah, we were just talking like two minutes ago. Okay. Well, there weren't any other boats there when I pulled up to the dock. Really? That is so weird. I guess she went home? Lauren?! Lauren! Um, maybe we should just head back in. Yeah, sure. Lauren?! Come on, I ll make some tea. And she saw the woman in white? In the same places that I did. Places? You ve seen her more than once? Yeah, I saw her last night in the woods. You were in the woods at night?! Yes! I was here and I saw the woman in white out the window so I went after her. Okay, so what happened? And then I just, I lost track of her again. And this other woman showed up today? You don t believe me. No one was docked. So what? Maybe you didn t see her boat. What would you think if I told you what you're telling me? I would believe you. I would at least be curious. You need to take a couple days off, carly. Are you even sleeping? I'm fine. I'm sorry, kevin. I didn't even ask you how your interview went. How did it go? It s fine. Yeah? I don t know, it was the strangest thing. I went to the school and the building and... There was no interview. Couldn't even find my contact sarah. It was just so odd. Well that's weird. Look, I m tired and I frankly don t feel like talking about it. Okay. Hon, you okay? Yup. Just got a little restless. Doing a little bit of work. Look, look what I just found. In one of the last letters that charles wrote to diana, he mentions some guy, it s kind of hard to make out... D... It s Daniel? Yeah, that s what I thought too. So, what I m thinking is I find out how many daniels were living in town at the time. One of them could be a suspect. I m gonna have to figure out what they were all doing the night that she was killed. But there could be something. You re gonna pull an all-nighter? No, I'll be up in a minute. Or an hour. I never knew charles personally. I knew of him. He came to town and visited diana on the island when john henry was away in europe for months. John henry nearly caught them. Charles had to hide out in the woods. The shadowy figure that john henry thought he was seeing was charles. And diana knew it... The affair was kept quiet. I found out when diana came into the shop to find a looser dress because... She was pregnant? And she didn't want john henry to know. Because it wasn't his. A few weeks before diana died, charles was seen in town. With the baby. That was the last time he was ever seen in pleasance bay. And diana stayed behind? It was only supposed to be for a few days while she tidied up her affairs. But john henry came home unexpectedly and stayed for longer than usual. She had no way out. John henry must've found out about charles and the baby. If you ask me, that bastard killed her. And daniel, was their child. Charles took him to new york, waited for diana and he raised him. I don't know about any daniel. Diana said she wanted to name a son after her father. Donald. Yes, how did you know? That's my grandfather's name. And that s where the resemblance comes in. It says donald, not daniel. "I'll send for you. Three days and we'll be together." that s three days before she was murdered. John henry knew. He knew. He knew, but how did he do it? How did no one see him? Hey carly. Lauren, hi. Welcome to my home. I don t understand... You have no idea who I am. You really don t recognize me, do you? I'm from your book, "disappearance on route 9". I'm peggy norris's daughter. Ashley. Ashley norris. You put my mom in jail for the rest of her life... She brutally murdered your father. She had to go to jail, ashley. You made me an orphan. I'm sorry. My father... My father was a monster. He deserved it. You don't understand anything. You disgust me. You re right. You re right ashley, I have no idea what you have been through. I was just trying to find the truth. Sometimes the truth is messy. Sometimes it hurts, but I never meant to hurt you. What are you doing?! What the hell s going on?! Kevin! She's real and she's trying to kill me. The woman in white, again? No, lauren! It s ashley norris... She s the daughter of a murderer that I put in jail... And she's living in the guest house... We need the phone! Okay, you're not making sense, just calm No, we don't have time for that. Carly? She's coming. Is kevin with you? Of course he is. Kevin, do you know about carly? She destroyed my family. She destroyed my entire life. That is the woman that you are with. You know what she said to me when I told her that? She said that sometimes the truth hurts." well carly, you can dish it, but can you take it? Kevin, did you ever tell carly about me? Did you tell her about all the weekends we spent together? How you would text me every single time she went out of town? Sometimes before she left. I once bumped into her coming out of the elevator. I was just a sweet, young acting student, looking to get some work in. But it was more than that wasn t it, kev? He told me that his marriage was on the rocks. That you don't even look at him anymore. Was that just to get in my pants, or... Was that true? We were together for six months. So tell me, carly. Does the truth hurt? You knew her. Ashley! Ashley, stop. Stop... Stop. Kevin. It's been a little while. Is that true? Did carly put your mom in jail? I... You never told me. It wasn't exactly the greatest pickup line. I just had no ide ash, you gonna shoot me? That depends. Whose side are you on? I swear I had no idea the pain you were suffering. I had everything taken away from me. Because of her book. It was you. What would people think, when they heard that she was seeing shadows and imagining conversations? Maybe, she imagined all of her cases. And you sent me away on that fake interview. I wanted some alone time with your wife. I don t understand how you got here? There was never any other boats. I swam. So how is this going to end, ash? You gonna kill carly? You re gonna kill me? I was thinking murder-suicide? Your crazy wife shot you and then shot herself. Carly! Get out of here! You should have left. We re almost there. Come on, we re almost there! Kevin, come! She took the boat! I can t swim like this! No, kevin! Kevin! Ashley, you don t have to do this. Please. Are you kidding? I have enjoyed every single second of this! I m, I m sorry... it s okay, it s okay. It s okay. When ashley revealed that she had swam to the island, I suddenly realized that john henry had done the same. The fateful night diana was murdered, she packed her bags and was ready to leave the island to be with charles and their son donald. But john henry had caught wind of the plan. He was a champion swimmer and he swam across to the island that night leaving his boat in town - the perfect alibi. By then the legend of the shadows was already cemented and in a jealous rage, john decided to utilize it. No, no, no, no, please. I m sorry. Please. No, john, please. No, john... I m sorry, please don't... He committed the horrific murder, disposed of diana's body into the water, and swam back, unnoticed. And after a very long investigation when there were no suspects, it seemed the town was ready to believe it was the legend of the shadows that got her. I m gonna share my findings with the local police, of course. In the meantime, I think diana's portrait would look a lot better here, don't you? Definitely. Think you'll publish the crawford story? Yes. Diana's story needs to be told. Do you, um... Have any thoughts about what's next? I haven't really made any decisions yet, kevin. The one thing I do know is that... I think I'm finally ready for a vacation.
