This is our Police Academy To everyone it is an Academy, but for me it is a temple Since their childhood, everybody will think of becoming either doctor or engineer but i have always wanted to be a police officer because it is my fathers dream and his last wish too My mother and my friends are the reason why i have reached so far for all of them, i will definitely win and will become a police officer (A man screaming) (Screaming fades) (Screaming starts again) Damn! I can't bear to hear his screams. Please ask our boss Kapali to kill him soon! The boss is coming tomorrow to rid this guy of his suffering! Hey! You should develop large heartedness by seeing the good in everything; not growing a prick by watching unwanted stuff! (Man writhing in pain) (Man writhing in pain) (Man writhing in pain) Kapali - doesn't he appear like a well marinated tandoori chicken? Kapali - forgive me! What? Forgiveness? If what you did was a mistake, I could perhaps forgive but what you did was break my trust! Damn you you plotted to kill me in the guise of being an aide! You need to have courage to murder someone or make big bucks, Fool! One should have guts...guts. Tell me why you did this? Just to lead a good life with your wife, isn't it? Hey, let go of me... Kapali - please do anything to me... not my wife, Kapali! Please let her go... Kapali means Lord Eeshwara! Once the third eye opens, you burn down to ashes! There won't even be a dead body - just ashes! Will smear it across the forehead like the "vibhoothi" (sacred ash) and walk off! Slash her to pieces right in front of him! No, no, please don't Kapali... Please let her go... No... no... (Woman screams) Sir what are you doing? Madam how many times are you to be told that this is a "No Parking" zone and vehicles shouldn't be parked here? Pay a fine! If "No Parking" signs are put up everywhere, where do we park then? I won't pay any fine! In that case, you can't take your vehicle either! Let me see how you won't let me take my vehicle! Madam apart from breaking the rules, you are throwing your attitude at me? What sir you seem to be throwing your weight on a girl? You think you can threaten a girl to make some money? Hey, mister mind your words! Her vehicle is in the "No Parking" zone. Just ask her to pay the fine. No need of any unnecessary talks. What will you do if she won't? I will tow it to the station... I dare you to touch the vehicle! Cops are for our safety . so, the only reason you raise a hand is to salute and not to hit them! Hey, just walk down and apologize to the cop. Sorry, my foot... Sir, sorry sir... please forgive me... Let me go sir... Please bless my son to become a police officer... Mother-in-law Are you here to pray for getting me and your son married soon? You & your silly mischiefs! When did you come? Let that be... Where is Raana? He has gone to the Huligi Temple... "Oh, Godess!" "Watch us over with your kindness & mercy!" "Oh, Godess!" "Oh, Godess!" "Hail Huligamma!" "Hail Huligamma!" "Oh, Hulikaambe, mother of Huligi!" "The one who reached from atop the hills!" "You are the kind Mother who keeps bestowing us with boons!" "You are the one who shelters those who are in pain & sorrow!" "You are our only faith & you are our only saviour - oh, Mother of Huligi!" "The Godess who maintains a balance of this world while in a palanquin!" "Hail Huligamma!" "Hail Huligamma!" "We crossed paths of fire chanting your name!" "We crossed rivers while drowned in complete devotion, oh Mother!" "Huligi!" "Huligi!" "Huligamma!" "You are the rain bearing clouds and you are the rain too!" "This Earth itself is your alms, isn't it?" "You are the Sun and you are the sunlight too!" "The one protecting us itself is you, isn't it?" "You have many forms but there is no one who can oppose you!" "The moment you threw your gaze upon us." "The notion of "I & Me" disappeared from us!" "You are the power in the "Shree Chakra"!" "You are the kind hearted Mother in this Dark Age ("Kaligaala")!" "Hail Huligamma!" "Hail Huligamma!" "You are the creator and you are the creation too!" "Nothing ever transpires without your orders!" "You are the protector and you are the destroyer too!" "Without you, all of us are non-existant!" "Please help us tide over our troubles," "Please protect us from all evil, oh Mother!" "We all are your kids and are fragile..." "You are the protective Mother whose heart is as tender as a flower!" "You are the beacon of our hopes & aspirations!" "You are reflected in every bit of our song & devotion!" "Hail Huligamma!" "Hail Huligamma!" "Hail Huligamma!" "Hail Huligamma!" Dude has Priya's dad really agreed to the alliance and come here? No he's here to play a game! Fool - he's come only because he has agreed! Would someone come unnecessarily otherwise? I had wanted to get my daughter married to a doctor or an engineer. I don't like that this guy wants to join the police. Hey... What to do? For the sake of my daughter... What sir? Are only engineers & doctors the ones who are capable of having a family? Just step out of your imagination and look at the world... you will know how even someone who drives a cab or an autorickshaw, works at a hotel and even daily labourers work hard to earn livelihood for their families! Sir, one who isn't at the mercy of anyone and earns his livelihood sincerely is always a King! If you don't like my job then, I don't need your daughter itself! Hey, Raana... Buddy... Hey Wait, will you? Raana I know becoming a police officer is your passion. I don't know why your dad doesn't like me becoming a police! Isn't a cop capable of running a family? I will talk to my dad. You just don't worry about it! Hey, what's up with these guys - they seem to have grown balls overnight? Those who were scrambling like lizards on the wall... ..have started posing like gangsters these days! That Kapali's brother Suri has come in yesterday. Dear... and that's the reason for the changed behavior of these scumbags! Who is Suri when we hardly care about his brother Kapali himself? If he tries to fly high... I will smash him to pieces right here in the bathroom! I can bear suspicion... ...but how can I bear insults? The entire village asks if you are born to me? When asked, your **** of a mother didn't answer me straight... When asked, your whore of a mother didn't answer me straight... so, I killed her! You join her too! My son Kapali alone is enough for me! I will raise him like a king! I don't need you... What sir - what are you looking there for? I'm the one who beat him up! Hi pal! Hi Giri! Keep that bag at the back. Come...come... so, how have you been? I'm super! Dude hope you didn't mind me being a bit late? In fact, I'm wondering how you made it this quickly in this traffic? Actually, it wouldn't have gotten late... Then? Why it was late, because.. One of my boys committed suicide in front of the airport... Suicide? Yeah! Why? There is a rowdy called Kapali - ******! He had lent money and our boy had not repaid it on time That prick snatched a young baby! 'A despicable fellow' The baby has kept on crying and died of hunger! Hearing this... our guy committed suicide at the airport. That prick didn't stop at that. he has gone to the wife and asked her to pay the insurance money she would get! The cab driving profession requires us to live by borrowing money! What a shitty world they want people to work hard and when people bend their backs to work hard others climb their back to ride them! What the hell! Dear... Listen,stop at a medical store I have a headache! Fine! Sir, please give me a tablet for headache. Yeah, ok... Hey, Raana! Hey! How are you? I'm fine and you? I'm fine too! How come you are not to be seen at the village? (BP tablet, is it) I haven't married one who they liked for me to be visiting whenever I like! They don't like that I married a person of my choice. So, they are still upset about it, I suppose. Perhaps, they will be alright once they have grandkids shortly... Oh! congratulations! Thank you! So, what's news at the village? How can there be any news when everyone migrate to the cities for livelihood? Earlier, people used to visit during weekends, now it's become month-ends and down the line, it might turn out to be year-ends. Over a period of time, they may even forget the villages itself completely! This middle-class life is quite like that buddy. it is exhausted entirely in a bid to earn! Sir, here is your tablet! He is my husband. Hey! Hi! Nice to meet you! Sagar! See you later! Bye, bye! Bye! Your friend is it? Yeah... Another large? No, Enough Kapali... No matter where I go, this is as much as I drink. Why? You don't trust me or what? Do you know what Kapali means? It means Lord Eeshwara. So, who else other than Lord Eeshwara would I trust? Besides you the the face of all my illegal assets! You asked for 10 crore rupees for starting a mutton-pork mixing plant and I gave you the money without a question. Right now, it is just a security guy who guards the pigs there! You think I do all this without trusting you? Sir... What? Kapali has a mistress, I believe! It seems she's too hot Have you seen her, sir? You ask me if she's hot or not? She's like an angel. One needs to touch her only after washing the hands clean. But, this rogue touches her even without showering. He's locked her up at the Sanjaynagar bungalow snatched from that merchant. She's a lovebird imprisoned in a golden cage! a lovebird imprisoned. Uh... Pacchi why are you standing there? Come. Come up here... Pacchi when did you arrive? I was telling my PA about you up until now... saying that one should learn loyalty from you! Don't mind but I was here to hear you praise about what fascinates you! Pacchi, Pacchi please don't go and share this with Kapali. If you do, he will target my wife! Is it? Just be bothered about whose vote is in whose favor... not whose d*%* is in whose... Got it? Bye then! Pacchi! Ok, Raana! Your documents are in order. your fitness is also right. Just take care to not have any criminal cases on you. Best of luck! All the best. Thank you, sir! Good luck! Excuse me, sir... Okay... Hello? Where are you? Here, at the academy... I'm near your room. Be here soon... Fine, I will be there shortly. Priya, you didn't even knock before barging inside a bachelor's room! Wake up, buddy. Priya is here! Come darling You know how much I like you? True love... True love... Not you though... Wake up, dude! I will love you more than your husband... come up to me now! It's Priya, dude... You & your Priya... Why speak of bitterness when I'm dreaming of a sweet dish? Does she even measure up to the range of our boy (Raana)? She's such a control freak! Criminals would fear seeing him once he becomes a cop and yet, he shivers seeing her! Such a shame! Dude! I don't like it one bit. Let me devise something to break them apart and find another girl for him! What say? What do you say? Uh... Hey, Priya madam is here! Buddy! my data is exhausted. Switch on the hot-spot for me please! Let it be... you can check it out tomorrow.` Are you done bathing? What? Done bathing? Done bathing? Who said so? Not yet done? Nope... How come you are all drenched then? Well - that's not being drenched but having sweat so much! He's sweat so much for this alone? You think it's a joke to exhaust 1.5GB of data? Oh crap! Oh no! Priya - I was watching some Yoga videos... Dude - you know how many postures are there? Crap! I loved one in particular though! You good for nothing fellow! Has she left or not? Hi Priya! You asked me to get back urgently what's up? Dad finally agreed for our marriage! Seriously? Yeah... he has now asked for your horoscope. Your dad is more concerned about the alignment of the planets than you & I being aligned, is it? Look, I couldn't care less! Just make sure to get a horoscope that matches well with mine! Alright I'm not one to get married with a thousand lies. I'm a man who will get married by saying the truth! Got it? My dad was impressed as you stood your ground about doing a job you love. I just told the truth, didn't I? My police job is more important to me than you! Is that so? Yes! The job is more important than me, is it? Hmm... Hey! Won't your friends watch us? Nope they won't look at all this. Even if there is such a situation for them to watch, they would rather pluck their eyes off! You better get off this place worse than a pigsty I sure will! Bro...Get me a drink he is going to be a police office, but still he is doing a part-time job, look at you morons... Bro... the broker was here yesterday and said he will show you 3-4 houses tomorrow. Okay, bye! Hey, you aren't even married and Priya already started ordering you, is it? You think I will just follow orders? We are the ones who are here to rule the world. We don't leave if one comes to quarrel with us. I have only given her my heart, it's regime is still mine! Let's see! Anyways, do wear the uniform. The RTO guys are on the prowl. Okay. Yeah, Priya... What's the progress on the new house? Have seen a few... ou can also see them and decide, okay Hello... Priya... hello? Hello? Fine. What about the horoscope? Well, go to a good astrologer. All of them seem to be on televisions so, who to go to? Well, am driving right now. Will call later, okay? okay? Okay! Why is she here? Why are you standing alone here at this hour in the night? Let me drop you home... Not needed... Where's your hubby? He isn't to be seen from 4 days. His phone is unreachable too. What? Not to be seen from 4 days? That's right! Why haven't you lodged a complaint with the police? I know that he has been kidnapped by the ones who have lent us money. I'm scared that if I go to the cops then, my husband will be harmed. I'm running around with money to pay them back from the last 4 days but haven't been able to locate them. Who is your lender? A man named Kapali. There is a rowdy called Kapali He had lent money and our boy had not repaid it on time. That prick snatched a young baby! Why are we here? My friend Nihal stays here and works for Kapali. Nihal... You are set to become a cop... why get into this mess? She is from our village, dude... Her husband is also at fault. It's been a year and there has been no sight of either the interest or the principal. To top it, they have lodged a complaint on Kapali as well. What you say might be true. and her husband might be at fault too but, what has this girl done wrong? Hey, we are from the same place... We are not people who say "why bother"? We are ones who live for others! You don't know anything about Kapali. You dare to open your mouth in front of him and that's the last time you will ever open it! I can't help you here. Hey... Dont say No... please do something ! Well then... let's do this. Here's a right hand man for Kapali - Pacchi. Things could work if we approach him. 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98... Boss... What? Raana... Sir - hello. I'm Raana and she is Abhishek's wife... I don't need anyone's wife as of now.. Let me be done with work and then let's check it out... Sir, she is the wife of the medical shop owner Abhishek. Say so properly. What's up now? Sir, we are here to pay the money and settle the matter regarding their loan with Kapali Who the hell prepared this tea - it's rubbish! Take it away! What is it with you both? Boss, they both are from the same village... What do you do? I work for a travel company. You are in a travel agency and she's from the same village. That's it, right? Nothing else, right? Why shy? The way you seem hesitant makes it seem that what I doubted earlier might be true! How much money do you have? 2 lakh rupees. Hey, you Fool... since how long have you been counting? You are quick to make bucks though.. No boss... got confused... Listen - your husband isn't with us. Someone has tipped you off wrongly. Whether things are bad between the two of you or he has run away with someone else how do we know! Just go and search for him. Hey, you travel guy just take your customer with you the one from your village! Why do you speak like this? Abhishek is with you! I suppose they are looking for more money! Hey, what's with the hush-hush talks? Nothing sir... looks like they are confused with the calculations. Why don't you tell us what the amount is? 4 lakhs. The loan was only for 1.5 lakhs. Even with the interest, it would only amount to 2 lakhs. You are trying to say that I'm swindling? Sir, sir... Were you there when he took the money? Just because you are here with your perfumes you think I will be ready to drop my pants down? Sir, please.. How dare she doubt my calculations? Sir, If I lose my mind, I will rip your skin out and hang you right here! Don't just keep all these with me. Just take her out from here, travel guy! Come... let's go... Hey, medical store lady apparently there's a condom that's called "extra force" - bring a dozen of them. Give me company until all of them are used. After that, I will send your husband even without the money! Is this deal okay for you? Let's just go, dude... They won't let go, buddy! They seem to have eyed the medical store. Either the money has to be paid or we need to let go of the store. Apart from that there is no other way. Here - take this. If we don't help people from our places, who else will? Thanks so much, pal! Hey, what's your relationship with the medical store woman? She's from my village, sir. Even I have friends those who join me only to hog & drink! It's appreciable that you have stood in her difficult time! Why won't he? That lady is good enough to look at for someone to even go to war with anyone. Hey! What's with that stare? Don't die in the streets of a city coming from a village! Hey you! Don't belittle people from the village! They are the ones who have ruled in Delhi too! Just sit down! He's staring, Kapali! You won't go home... I will slash you into pieces & pack you in gunny bags! Hey, how much have you brought? 4 lakhs! You shouldn't have let him go, Kapali. These people should be beaten to pulp right then & there! We reached home. I will get him off... You step aside... Sir, it will all be alright... just step out carefully... Thanks, Raana! Hey, what are you doing? Why all this between us? Bring some water to drink... Yeah, I will... Please go towards that side... That side. Why are you so upset sitting at the reception? Look at them how they are lost in each other without a care about the rest of the world! And, here I have a boyfriend who forgets about love and keeps talking about the entire world! He has anyways given the horoscope as you asked of him, right? Then, why are you still mad at him instead of being happy? Just imagine no one at home except you & your boyfriend... Boyfriend and for me? Well, I still have hopes,no doubt! You are just wearing a slip and he barges in suddenly! Hey, Priya come out I need to speak with you Why are you here? Mom's at the neighbor's house and will be back any minute! Priya - come out - I need to speak with you. I can't. Tell me what it is from there itself. Hey you had asked for the horoscope, right? I have brought it. Keep it right there - I will take it. This is a horoscope and can't be kept wherever... It seems that I need to hand it over to the one I'm getting married to! I can't... just leave it there and go. I will give it to you when we meet next then. Bye! Fine... wait a minute! Give me the horoscope... Leave soon before mom gets back... Fine... By the way, don't take your lunchbox today. Let's go out for lunch, ok? Oh, what's up with the sudden lunch plan? Didn't know I had to seek permission to take my girl out for lunch! Alright - you leave... I will join you for lunch. I will be waiting! Your boyfriend is seeing you for the first time in his life in such a dress. How would you feel? You are upset for this, is it? Let it go... Still... Hush... hush... Sorry, sorry, sorry... Is that the way for someone to barge in - as if they have no brains? That's not the thing... Then, what else? Seeing you in such a state and still not doing anything... How would one feel? Idiot! I felt so insulted! I thought that after barging in that way and seeing you in a single-piece of dress he did something that upset you... What does it mean though? that I'm not hot enough? Nothing like that... The guys from this generation are a waste, I tell you! I only have an hour's permission. How far will you take me out for lunch? What's wrong with you? You seek permission to even spend some lovable time? I have taken permission to eat, not to be lost in love! Won't you even think a bit romantically at least? I have seen how romantic you are! What's the matter? Nothing! Well, in the morning, you slipped and I shrank like a bar of soap! You ran away knowing that I would see you in that state, didn't you? Why talk about what happened in the morning, now? That was the first innings. and this is the second! I must admit though, you looked gorgeous when headed for the bath in the morning! Enough of seeing me, watch the road and drive! Alright. Hey, listen what I fix are the rates. If you try to act smart then... Boss, that travel guy is here with some girl... Go, take a look at what it is about... Sure, boss! Boss.. He's a decent guy and would be here for lunch. Boss.. he's ordered lunch. Go, keep an eye on him... I will, boss! Can I take your order, sir? Hey, you order while I use the washroom... Give me here... Anything special? Okay, madam... Boss... someone is beating our guys black & blue... Who is he? Don't know, boss. In your office today... Hello sir! Who is that? Just someone I know... Kapali... 2 gangs have entered the city, targetting you Who are they? Even I don't have the details. It's just an information. Do those Fool think I'm the Kapali theatre (a renowned cinema hall) to just raze the building? Kapali, this rowdyism itself is like the game of snake & ladders. No one knows when a ladder is available or when a snake would swallow! Just be cautious! This is Kapali's godown for all his illegal stuff. This is where he locked your brother and killed him & his wife! Even their bodies weren't found. Stop here. Hey, come here! What are you all doing here at this hour? We are Kapali's boys, sir. Those guys from Prakash's gang have plotted to kill Kapali it seems. That is why the boss has asked all our guys to be prepared on the ground. I think they don't know much about Kapali. Finish them off quietly and get going. Public & media shouldn't get to know. Please come in, sir! Take a look it is built as per Vaasthu. It's as if the place was made to order for family dwelling! Even if the couple fight, no one would get to know! Why would you jinx it, sir? I'm not even married yet! It will all happen in time... please come in... Look From what I see, based on the names alone, this is a good match! On top of that, when the horoscopes are tallied, it's even better! I liked the house, sir. Here you go with the advance. Okay! Sir... Tell me please... Just a condition though! What's that? Just don't look towards that house opposite to yours... Please don't sir... Why? That is Kapali's mistress's house so, keep distance! Everyone says she is so hot to look at! Have you seen her? Nope... Just that the milkman was here at 7AM, then, the vegetable vendor... She never turned up at all... Hey, have you been just watching or carrying out a watchman's duty? Hey! You seem to have observed so much with attention to detail! We need to be watchful in a new house, isn't it? Sweetheart I'm a cop not a rogue! Hey, I have brought some sweets. I made them. Oh! How's it? It's a bit short on sweetness. where's my phone? It must be in the kitchen. I have missed a call from mom. Call her back. Look, don't you dare getting your friends here to party saying that there is still time for the marriage! I don't like those dirty friends of yours! Hey! Dude she's acted alongside top actors from Telugu & Tamil languages, I believe. Falling in love with Kapali, she's the one who settled down here. One never can ascertain why and whom these girls fall for, buddy! Isn't it? Dude... like the Ramyakrishna character in the film "Neelambari" who bathes in blood, she bathes in milk, it seems! That's how she's so fair! Can't see at all! I mean can't see her! Hey, what are you guys doing here? Hey, is this what you call a sweet? Why? Is this a sweet? What happened? Where do you get such lousy stuff, anyways? (Mumbling under his breath) Stop it, will you? If ever a diabetic person eats this... Hold it off, pal... He will be so dissatisfied that he will stop eating sweets altogether! Just stop it man... Hey, Priya! When did you come? Will you have some sweets? It is lousy and you had to come in when I was eating this lousy sweet, is it? Don't know which lousy person made it... Just stay quiet... Hey, why? Priya... Buggers... Priya, wait... Didn't Priya hear anything I said at all? She didn't even thank me (for saving her from eating the lousy sweet)! Forget them... We just need to ensure that we open beer bottles before the housewarming ceremony! You just ruined it all, fatso! You ate the laddoo (sweet) right? What was the need for a review? Couldn't you have shut your mouth? She was the one who prepared it! Dude, as it was your girl, I just gave a review. If it was my girl, I would have divorced her! Tell me honestly - was the laddoo good? What the hell, guys! No wonder you don't have a girlfriend.` What? I know it isn't good. With girls, you must lie that things are good even when they are not! Even if she's hefty, you need say she's bubbly! That great Harishchandra himself would have lied to his wife So, what are we compared to him? Is that right? Uh, no! Hey, Priya - that's not what I meant! Hey, Priya This laddoo tastes sweet! She won't believe now... She won't, right? 100%, she won't! Boss, the team that has plotted to kill Kapali is the one who beat you too! No. That guy has planned and targetted to hit me! He is surely someone I know. He covered his face so that I don't get to know. I need to know who that is. I won't spare him! Hi sis! Hi! Hello? Hey, Priya! Sweetheart! What was such a big deal that you are so upset? Look, I have kept all those guys away! They will never sneak this side ever again as they have some shame too! Please sweetheart... I'm sorry and I miss you too! Please forgive me this one time! Sis - the call is answered and on speakerphone! Priya, please sweetheart! Priya... I have answered instead of disconnecting the call. Hello? Hey, we all feel so sorry for having been the reason for your current situation! Stop that, will you? Dude, Tell me what needs to be done. I will do it. You just drink up your booze. That's enough. Go, die! Okay! He's been calling incessantly the whole of yesterday! I didn't pick any. But, today.... there's not even one. Looks like the call you wanted happened. Why wouldn't you pick it up now? Hello! Life is not about receiving whatever comes our way. We need to maintain a certain level of self-respect! (Mumbling under the breath) Never short of such attitude! Raana is calling me... Speak... Okay... Tell him I'm not here... Hello? Hi, Sneha! Hope you have been well! (Priya whispering) Speak.. Yeah, I have been good! Actually, Priya isn't here.. Well, I called to speak with you! With me? Yeah... Well, speak then.. Why? Shouldn't I speak with you? Nothing wrong at all... please speak... Stay away... Hey, hand over the phone to me... Give me the phone... Hello? Hi Priya! How dare you speak with my friend? Why? What discussion you should've with my friend? That is... If you are so courageous then, speak right to my face. I don't have the courage to face you so, I'm standing right behind! Uh? Back? You followed me here too? You are still angry at me? I'm out of this game... Hey, Sneha... where are you off to? Carry on... Join me... let's speak a bit personally! She will feel a lot more jealous! Sit down! You call her just because I don't pick calls, is it? Knocking the neighbor's door is how the door to our house seems to open, I reckon! Is that so? Then, go knock on the neighbor's door! Hey, Priya! Get lost... Wait, Priya... I was just joking... "Hey you beauty, Shall I become your partner?" "I have been feeling anew and refreshingly different!" "Hey you beauty, Shall I become your partner?" "This love doesn't require any receipt." "If you say "Yes" and not a "No"," "I will plant a kiss officially!" "I'm a guy from the streets and you are a city bred girl," "Our hearts seem to have been in sync!" "I'm handsome and you are beautiful," "Our horoscopes seem to have been strong!" "Now that we have a license for our love," "Let us book a flight!" "Tell me a place of your choice and we will fly there even without looking at a map!" "Let us sit together to enjoy the ground mixture of tamarind & jaggery." "Okay, okay... I understood what you want so, let's get going!" "Tell me who is your favorite?" "That's you!" "I'm a graduate in love! Super!" "Our love is like the patchy road which got laid with tar!" "You are a guy from the streets and I'm a city bred girl," "Our hearts seem to have been in sync" "You are handsome and I'm beautiful," "Our horoscopes seem to have been strong!" "Click a selfie without a filter." "Those who see it would have to admit that we are a super couple!" "Dunno why, but when beside you, I feel like it's winter." "Then just hug me baby since I'm your heater!" "Our pair is a superhit! Awesome!" "I will share savories to one & all. Okay!" "My attitude grew after you became mine!" "You are a guy from the streets and I'm a city bred girl" "Our hearts seem to have been in sync!" "You are handsome and I'm beautiful," "Our horoscopes seem to have been strong!" "I'm a guy from the streets and you are a city bred girl," "Our hearts seem to have been in sync!" "I'm a bad boy and you are an angel," "Our pairing is the best!" Oh, Raana, it's you! Go on... move... What happened? You still don't know, is it? No... Our boss Kapali has been attacked and hence the search. You leave... We have completed the surgery but... But? As it's a head injury, he's in coma Just wait for 48 hours. There's God to take care. They say this is the best hospital in the city and you are the best doctor! Did I bring him here to be told that God is there to take care? If anything happens to him, you will be the one who will meet God! Understand? Suri don't worry. Nothing will happen to your brother! I'm here. Hey, MLA! You think I'm one of your voters to be bluffed? Suri... How could you let this happen to my brother while being around him? Well, Suri.. If my brother doesn't wake up then, it will be your funeral before his! I'm coming from the crime scene, Suri.` Looking at things I don't feel it's an attack by a group. Looks like the work of a single person. If I get the other piece of this bat, it will help my investigation. The one who did this has attacked from behind... It also appears that the person might be left handed. I will have to check the engine so, I will need 3 days. Is it? Yeah... Fine then. Hello? Hello, Mr. Raana? Yes, sir. Your name has been shortlisted based on the interview conducted the other day. Good luck! Okay, sir! Thank you, sir! Spread the word throughout the city about my brother Kapali being attacked by a bat. Round up anyone you find suspicious! Don't spare anyone. Who do you think would have attacked Kapali, sir? Kapali has enemies all over the city so, it's difficult to guess who would have carried out this attack. You guys will never be able to earn such big bucks! Just show me who attacked my brother... and this is all yours! One can perhaps tie an irate elephant but not Suri in this mindset. God knows what he will be up to and what he will end up doing! Suri... What? I have a doubt... that Murthy & Prakash are the ones who would have attacked, Kapali. Hey, Suri I have not attacked your brother! I have not attacked... If I had then, there wouldn't have even been a body to be carried to the cemetary let alone to a hospital! Your body will be available though... Throughout the city and in pieces... Suri... please don't... Move aside... You will face the music now... We shouldn't spare him today, boss.. Pacchi... Where is Murthy? I don't know, Pacchi... Bloody scumbags... Pacchi... I don't know, Pacchi... you guys plot to attack Kapali, is it? I will skin you apart... Get up... Pacchi... everyone is watching... Pacchi... Suri... it's not me, Suri! Not me.. What's the matter, aunty? You asked me to visit... Yes. Well, Priya witnessed some ruckus at the hospital felt very scared She isn't stepping out of her room. Can you check on her please? Sure! Please don't worry. I will check. Sweetheart! Hey! Hey! No need to be scared for these silly stuff. Get up! What happened? I won't go to work anymore. Why? I saw a man getting beaten up right in front of my eyes... They are called rowdies for a reason. Such things are common amongst them. These things shouldn't stop you from working! If we know how to stay away from trouble, no one would harm us. Let us go to my native and visit mom. What say? That reminds me... What? Mom's away... Okay... I'm a typical conservative girl... So? You have about 10 minutes time for romance... Come, let's travel to my native... Get up and get ready dear ! Something is not right... Imagine you are Prakash. What would you do if death were to stare you in my form? Knowing that you would die for sure, wouldn't you gloat that you were the one who attacked my brother? Would you beg for mercy? Nope... Someone else is involved! It's an exact match, Suri! Boss, we stopped his cab just a couple of streets away from where Kapali was attacked. Guaranteed that it is him, Suri! The forensics guy said that the attacker was left handed. This guy is a leftie too! Call him. What's the need for a phone when I'm next to you? Someone is calling... let me see who it is. Nope. It will remain switched off u ntil we get back. Until then, you will just listen to me! Okay, boss! Boss, it is not reachable. Keep trying... Even if he doesn't pick up the phone, I will pick him off from this world! Shortly, he will start working and your parents have also agreed for the marriage. The sooner your marriage is completed, my wish will be fulfilled. See buddy, how quickly the mother & daughter in law are getting close. Can you cook? Yes, I can. Yeah right! Now they seem to be getting along. I will also teach you. Just wait until you are married and then you will see them fight like roosters in a ring! You will need to teach too. You just need to have an interest to cook. Don't scare me buddy! I'm not scaring you, just warning you! I will teach you one right away. Is that so? Do it once and you will learn it yourself. Mom - will you keep talking or serve me some food too? No asking me anything anymore. Ask your wife whatever you need from now on! Let's see! It's started already, pal! Aunty... Hey, Raana! When did you arrive? Just today. Hello aunty! What Purshi? You are here after such a long time? My marriage is fixed so, I'm here to invite you. Is it, buddy? Oh, you got it all done by yourself even without telling us a word? Let me see too... Nothing like that, aunty. It all got fixed so quickly. Raana - come along for a minute, please. Tell me, buddy. Look, there's a bachelor's party today you shouldn't miss it buddy! I can't pal... am headed back. Don't give me reasons. You are not gonna miss it and we will enjoy! Okay? You need to make it... bye! Ashoka - where is Raana? He is a family man now... how would you find him with us? Have been trying to reach him for a while but the phone seems to be not reachable. Tell me what the matter is... The bat which was used to attack our bossKapali has been found in his car. Tell me the truth - what did he do? What would he do? Don't you know about our pal? The evidence is stacked up against him that way. Suri has everyone in his gang looking for Raana. Just escape from wherever you are and inform the others too. Tell me Suri... Leave that taxi driver's matter to me to handle. Your department need not get involved. Fine but make sure that no news related to this incident gets out in the public domain. Won't people label us as drunkards if we booze every day? We need a good reason to drink! Here you go... Take it. What's in it? A bus fell off a cliff and killed 20 people... We got the reason... drink up! Good reason. Hey, you are Raana's friend, right? Hey, it is something known to everyone and yet, you are here asking me about it in a bar? You seem to new around here! Get going! Hey! Uh? One should never disturb a tiger that's ready to hunt and a man drinking in a bar! You get the hell out of here! Get the hell out... I will see you tomorrow. From now on... The entire Bangalore... From tomorrow, our boy will rule all over the city... What the hell are you staring at? Uh? What are you staring at? I will pluck those eyes and play with them like marbles! If I lose my mind, I'm not a man at all... err... I won't remain a human is what I meant... Look... Will you walk off from here or want to be carried out as a dead body? You decide! Hey! You better decide! Hey! My dad hesitates to look at me in just a vest and yet here you are seeing me nude! How are you guys comfortable with it? You seemed to be flying high at the bar? Of course, boss - that was the booze hitting my senses. Now that your thrashing hit me, I'm back to my senses! Do you even know about my friends? Dude... Oh, you do seem to know about them! We have rounded up his friends and won't spare that Raana, no matter where he is, boss! Dude... What is it? they say our Raana attacked Kapali. Where is Raana? "Come near me, oh colorful lady!" "Nope, I feel so shy!" "Why don't you stand still?" "My legs hurt if I stand still!" "Shall I follow you?" "Please don't; things will be ruined!" "Shall I bring home something for you?" "No - everyone is watching!" "Hey you naughty-beauty," "The one with slender hips and a wheatish color!" "You are like a firefly" "In search of whom I have travelled all over the place!" "You are a notorious theif of hearts!" "A true notorious!" "I'm a boy from Hubballi!" "Oh boy from Hubbali - I'm a flower that's in full bloom!" "Why do you look at me as if you would devour me?" "You can't take me for a ride just by playing with words!" "I'm most beautiful belle in this village!" "Oh, yeah, I'm aware of that." "If only I gesture slightly..." "Then, the entire village will be sleepless." "If I go visit the village fair..." "I know, it will halt to a standstill!" "If I meet someone alone..." "Then, it's as if he has won a wrestling match!" "Oh naughty one... you said you will meet me..." "If you do, then, all my properties will be in your name!" You are a notorious theif of hearts! You are like a sensuous creeper! Just turn around to give me a look. I'm a boy from Hubballi! Shall I bring you a saree? No, it would slip off... "Shall I adorn your hip with an ornament?" "No, the hip already has a sprain!" "Shall I place an earring then?" "No, that would cast bad eyes on me!" "Shall I kiss you then?" "No, that would go viral!" "How do I withstand your adorable tortures..." "The one who has followed me all over the place?" "If things go well between us then," "We can visit some places together!" "You are a notorious theif of hearts!" "How much will you keep pestering me?" "I will now take control myself!" Lets go. Auto! Come, get in.. Take us to Jayanagar... What? Nothing! Hey, Mani! How come you are here? I just finished my work and headed back home, brother. Your phone seems to be switched off and you are nowhere to be found? Well - "someone" switched off my phone! Let that be as it may be... what's the status of my cab? Is it reparied & ready? Yeah, it's ready, bro. Hey, Mani... wait... Hey, what happened? Stop Why are you running? Hey! What amazing guts you have? Thought you would have fled the city after attacking Kapali but, you are roaming around with your girl? What? Kapali? I haven't attacked anyone... Hey, don't play games with me... Look, you need me, right? Let me drop her and be back... Uh? I love "buy one get one free" offers.. Come, my love... Hey, let go of me... Raana... Hey, go attack him... Leave me... Raana... Come with me... This entire area is under our control, Suri. They can't escape from here! Hey, Hey, Priya...why? What happened? Come, come... Hey, listen to me properly... Apparently, that travels guy has entered our area and Suri boss has asked us to search. Just search! Hey, why the hell did you attack Kapali? Are you out of your mind? Have I not been with you for the past 3 days? My dad kept saying that a police job is not required... Should have listened to him... Uh no.. Things are like this even before you join the police... Can't imagine how it would be once you join... Priya... It isn't safe for us to stay here for long... Here Call your parents and ask them to leave immediately. If my father gets to know, that would be the end of it! Understand the situation, Priya! Please call them right away! They are near the scrap road at the market, Suri. Call all our guys... Ask Kalki to enter from the Town Hall side. Let us lock them from the Kalasipalya side. They shouldn't slip away at any cost! Hello? Raana.. where are you? Hey, I haven't attacked Kapali, buddy! The bat that was used to attack him was found in your car though! That's a car belonging to a travel agency man! So many people get in and alight in a single day. There must have been some confusion! I will speak with Suri! What reason do I have to attack Kapali anyways? Suri isn't in a mood to listen to anything, dude! What do I do then? Where are you right now? In a small lane in the scrap road at the market. Of all the places, why did you have to go there? Why? Suri has a gang for almost every lane there... Buddy! You are trapped, Why are you scared? I'm running along only because you are with me. Or else... No need, Raana! If this were to end today, I would have myself asked you to hit back at them. They will keep getting back at us. So, it's best for us to go away somewhere! Fine. Come along. Priya! Don't be scared... I'm there... Hey! You are screwed! Packing you in bags as pieces is confirmed now! Hey! Suri is coming from the other side so, if you step that way, you will be killed in one blow! Standing here will mean getting beaten by all of us! Decide for yourself! Darling - don't worry that you would no more have a lover. We are all here! Each of us could take turns everyday to be your lover for the day! Don't be scared, To succeed in life, one needs to be courageous! Until I stand as your shield, you should never take a step back! Let us finish him off before Suri arrives here... Sir try to understand sir Hey, not even our neighbour's would get to know of our existence that's how I led my life! And now, you have brought us all to this mess! Sir, why should i kill Kapali... A wife would be anxious about the time at which her husband would get back home every night whereas, if my daughter marries you, she will not even know whether or not you will return! Priya, at least you say something to him... Sir... please come with us... please... Nothing will happen. Dont worry.. Look - just stay with your relatives in Mandya for a while. I will take you all back once all this is all sorted. You also come along with me. Look.. A battle can't be won by staying quiet. Let it be decided whether it is him or me! You just stay safe. I'm there for you, Okay! I will surely be back for you! Stay strong! Alright! Just go, Priya. I won't go... please... Come along, Priya... You join us too... Nothing will happen, come along, Priya. Hey smash every damn thing! He should get scared of my hunt.. I somehow feel that fleeing the city is the safest way out! What? Why the hell should I flee? Why should I? Raana.. This city doesn't belong to just any one person! millions of people who have been leading a life in this city until now! Suri or Kapali are not the reason for. It is because people trust the police! As someone who has to work in that department to run away from these things instead of facing them head-on! It would be an insult to the uniform I would be wearing! Hey! My friends are in this mess because of me... how can I disown them at this stage? If they are caught, they will beat them to pulp and send them back home but, if you are caught, they will just kill you, man! It's so much better to die fighting instead of running away to stay alive! You don't get it, Raana! Hey! Have some patience... What the hell is he saying? Listen to me, Raana... Forget it guys! Sir the travel guy isn't the one who has attacked Kapali! Is it enough that you say so? At the time when Kapali was attacked, he had dropped one of our people to the airport, sir. That being the case, he isn't God to be present in two places at once, isn't it sir? Even God can't save you guys! Only Kapali can. What do you mean? Only when Kapali wakes up and tells the truth, will that Suri listen. I somehow doubt that guy having attacked Kapali. Why do you say so, sir? In a raid last night, 6 girls were arrested. One of them was with 2 guys those guys had Kapali's wallet. I didn't arrest them though sent them off. I know what they do and where they will go. You are sitting here and smoking away to glory! Bro... why..? You piece of shit, you think you are some biggie! an't do a simple thing assigned to you! All I asked for you guys was to keep your head down and not to surface anywhere! Instead, you are off sniffing ass! Sorry, bro! Hey, did you get Kapali's wallet? I told him not to take it but he... Hey, where's the wallet? Bring it up... give it to me... Be off from the city right away! Otherwise, even I will be snuffed to the ground along with you guys! Buzz off! There's just half the money here, boss! Hey, did you kill, Kapali? If only you had finished him off as I told you to,then, I would have paid full! What's our mistake in this? We were just waiting for the right time & place to kill him. At 9pm, he went inside the Naidu hotel and we waited. Later, when we went inside, Kapali was nowhere to be seen. We didn't know where he was off to. Thinking that he would be at his girlfriend's place, we went there. Even that place was locked. So, while on our way back, we found his car on the road. Next to it was Kapali's dead body, boss. Our minds froze and we just ran away from there. What crap! You guys ruined it all! What's the matter? I was the one responsible for all of Kapali's collections (money). With so much money right in front of my eyes, I snuck a few once. Then, I got emboldened. Was never able to really enjoy with the money I could lay my hands on. It was then that I decided to finish off Kapali. You don't fret! I will pay twice the amount Kapali used to pay you! Just let things be and come to an agreement right here. Dude, We can't trust the cops. Instead, let's go to either the commissioner's office or the court and surrender. Surrendering at the commissioner's office or the court? There's a process for all this and it takes a lot of time. Kapali's guys are also searching for you guys everywhere. Crap! How the hell did we get stuck in all this? What do we do now? I need a car! For what? I will kidnap Kapali's mistress. Hey, Raana... What the hell is he planning now? I have a feeling something will go wrong! This house has security round the clock. There is no way that Raana can get out of this mess! Even in the extreme chance that both Kapali & Suri are killed you think their boys will leave you guys alone? If you are to have a chance to survive, you guys need to leave town. Is Kapali's mistress really in this house at all or is it all hearsay? I don't know any of that... I'm scared and I'm off from here... Just let me go... Sir... sir... listen to me... It's between you and Kapali... Sir... sir... (Girl screaming) Hey, shut up! Hey, Hey, shut up! Dude, you just drive... Let go of me... Hey, everyone is searching for me thinking that I have attacked Kapali. Call Suri and ask him to release my friends. He won't listen if I tell him but, if you do, he would. I know very well that you are as important to Kapali as much as Kapali is important to Suri! He had got a job as a cop and was about to get married too. Look at what has happened now because of all this mess he's gotten into criminal activities! Hey, just stay quiet. Dude, call Nihal. Hey, dude! Raana... Oh, damn! What happenned? Dude, Kapali is dead! Kapali was the only one who could save you. Now that he is gone, it's all over! All over now! Man turns into a demon in his anger however, this Suri was already a demon! Hey, buggers, we have been asking you all along - where's Raana? Even when you ask a sheep to bark like a dog, it can only do what it knows to do! They won't budge this way, Suri! What now, dude? Get up! Brother... Don't know, is it? Suri - he's still breathing! Go and throw this body in front of his house! No matter where he is, that Raana has to come to me! Otherwise, he needs to know that a dead body of another of his friends would be ready to be received. You guys go & surrender. "There is no sun & no moon and the sky is empty!" "With no friends & relatives, peace is shattered!" "Courage is diminishing when there's a search for fortitude!" What happened? They have killed Giri it seems! "Courage is diminishing when there's a search for fortitude!" Our other friend will also be killed if you don't surrender to Suri, it seems! "With whom an entire childhood and growing up years were spent!" "With no meaning for life and no justice for death," "Dunno what's in store as living itself seems meaningless." "All alone even in dreams, dunno what's in store!" Ashok - some rowdies came home and destroyed everything. Please tell us where Raana is! I haven't met him at all! Aunty, this is Raana speaking... Raana - am totally at a loss of ideas... I don't know what to do! I'm so scared that they will kill my son like they killed Giri! Aunty... no, I will ensure to get Praveen back without any harm. I will surely bring him back, aunty! Please do something, son! "Even known streets are throwing up hurdles..." "Where is the friend who was with me until now?" "It's an incident that can't be understood!" "The usual place we used to sit at, is asking what happened?" "The lamps that used to light up the streets are asking how this happened?" "Giri unnecessarily lost his life because of me, buddy!" "No answers to be found and everything remains as just questions!" "I'm a lonely guy now with no words to speak!" "Let time turn back the clock to wipe off the mishaps!" "With no meaning for life and no justice for death," "Dunno what's in store as living itself seems meaningless." "All alone even in dreams, dunno what's in store!" Stop the vehicle! Get down... get down, I said. No... Come... Look...I'm sorry to have involved you in this. Take this money and just go far away from here. Let's go! We could have somehow tried to negotiate with Suri using that girl as a leverage! Nope... She's of no use to us! You go home! And you? I will meet Suri! What? Are you out of your mind? Pull over the vehicle! Hey, listen to me... don't do this... Hey... No, don't do this! Leave me! Giri is dead because of me... Don't be with me and ruin your lives! At least you can live peacefully. No, buddy... let's think of something else! nobody will survive with me Take this... It's all over! How long shall I keep running? I can't anymore! If something happens to me please ask my mom & Priya to forgive me if possible, please! There's no other way other than having to either find who killed Kapali or to admit that I did! Dude, the girl who we just got off of our car she boarded my car on the day Kapali was attacked! They say she never gets out so, why was she out that night? Also, she had covered her face. Please stop, son... Where do you need to go, madam? My daughter isn't keeping well our house is close-by - Rajajinagar, 6th block. Please drop her till there... I plead you! Fine... Please get in... Come and get in now... come on... Get in... get in... Do you want me to take to a hospital, madam? Not needed... a good night's rest at home is sufficient. Please drop us home. Where to, madam? There is some connection to Kapali's attack and this girl. We need to find what that is! I thrashed her in an effort to find out what happened learned something that soothed my heart, boss! That girl was the one who killed Kapali! hat night when I was headed back home after work... "Die.. die..." She was smashing his head with a cricket bat! I was only able to stand & watch there without being able to do anything.I went away from there! While running away from there, I saw your boys in the street. Fearing that they would kill that girl, I went back to that girl. She was sitting there dumbstruck! She didn't even remember who I was! Hey, hey! I felt very sorry for her. In a bid to help her, I brought her home. Keep going... keep going... That's all. Boss, that girl's necklace is with her only. You aren't cooking up stories for the sake of that necklace, are you? No sir... she gave me the necklace herself. I just helped her as I felt sorry for her. That's all. Boss, that girl had a stomach ache and Kapali came home drunk too, that night. They both (Kapali & the girl) went to the hospital. Where the hell were you guys then? Kapali had sent us out for some work that night, boss. Then, how did that bat reach the cab? That bat was with the girl itself boss. I was the one who threw it at the back of the car. The driver didn't notice it. Let this new information not get out. Ok, boss. Whatever is known until now, let it remain so! I have an outstanding to settle with that Raana so, let him pay for it! What about her? Take her somewhere far away and finish her off! Boss, that girl is too hot and what if we find her before Suri finds her? Find that girl before Suri gets to know any of this. Railway station, bus stand and even auto rickshaw drivers - check them all out! Yes, boss! Did you see a girl with curly hair, anywhere around here? Oh, that girl? I just dropped her at the main road. Take me there... There was that other lady with her too, isn't it - the maid? I suppose we can get something out from her about Kapali, right? I was the one who killed Kapali. Go, tell this to Suri and all your problems will be solved. I was the one who killed Kapali. I left the place thinking he was dead. I killed him with the bat found is his cab. Suri - she would have told Raana everything. If her history gets out, it would cause another issue. Greetings, boss! A local contractor's daughter is kidnapped her dad is a multi-millionaire! What? Yes. He is one among the top-50 richest men in India. The news of this kidnapping has reached the media, making it a burning headline topic! So many ministers' phones have been busy just for this reason. The Bombay police are on alert! Even if we were to apologize, we would be finished off, let alone do anything for money. If the cops get to know about our involvement then, rest assured that all the bullets with the state police will find their way into my body! I don't know what to do now! Please hide her somewhere! Suri... What's your name? Where do you stay? Tell me... Say it... What is it? She doesn't remember anything? Hey, what's your name? what's your name? Say it! Boss she hurt her head and seems to have forgotten everything since then. Hello? Kapali... Your name is off of the encounter list so, you can enter the city now. Each one has a different thing to say about her. Who are you? I don't know. Don't remember anything. However, I do know that... Kapali had locked me up forcefully. How long will you keep savouring the same girl? Every woman is the same in the darkness. Why risk it? Just snuff her life out and wash your hands off! One needs luck to relish wealth as well as a wealthy woman! She's such a luck that has fallen right on to my plate all by itself! in case her dad decides to conduct an event where she were to choose her own suitor! Heroes, builders, ministers' sons will stand in a queue to get married to her That's her range so, I'm okay with any risk to keep relishing her. Where to, Suri? She said she will meet us. The moment we meet her... I will finish off that Raana... That girl could have escaped whenever she wanted to... But, she got caught trying to help us. Suri will surely kill her! Haven't we undergone enough even without having committed anything wrong? Whereas, she's actually committed a wrong so, she will pay for it accordingly! Where's that girl? First release my friend. You first surrender that girl... I will let go of your friend in the morning. You are criminals who live a life of distrust regarding those right next to you! And, I need to believe you! Release my friend first! Pacchi! Hey, it's Suri boss... Tell me boss.. Hey, Release that travel guy's friend... Why boss? Fool.. Do I need to sing a lullaby and feed you to narrate everything that's happened? I will let him go, boss! I have asked them to let your friend go. Where's that girl? Follow me. I don't have the courage to face that girl now, dude. You go and show them... Where's she? Show them... Come with me, boss.. Hey, the rest of you stay here.. Where the hell is she? Right here, boss. Suri please kill me as soon as you can.. Hey, buzz off from here... Boss, can I and Raana both leave? Both of you wait outside and we will be there shortly. Hey, take him away. Come with me... Just tell me who I am and that's enough! You can kill me after that... But, I don't want to die being called as Kapali's mistress. Where are these guys? Oh, they have snuck in due to the cold, I suppose! Hey, Ramu... Kalki.. Hey, Kalki... Suri... The mobile network isn't available... The car tyres have all been punctured.. We are not the ones here to hunt him, he has brought everyone here to hunt us down! He's screwed us well, Suri. It's a risk if we stay here. Let's get out of here first, Suri! I'm someone who fights scores of people at once... And, you ask me to run away fearing just one guy? No way! Pick up the weapon... Suri, no... listen to me... Please don't harm them, Suri... Search! Suri & Pacchi took away that girl... And, I went to my friend's place. I don't know what happened after that. He said the same thing at the station too, sir. That he wasn't the one who killed Kapali and it was the girl. Even Kapali's brother Suri confirmed the same. However, There is no whereabout of Suri at all... So, based on what you mean, did Suri's enemies finish him off then? Even I'm unable to ascertain, sir. There were 8 guys with Suri that day. All of them are missing. There will be a clue with just one murder It's dangerous to even just have an acquaintance with death and yet, here you are toying with it? I will cut you to pieces so that even a dead body isn't available and do the same with all your friends & family too! We live with the hope of parents and friends, if we focus on you leaving them aside, there will be no gundas in the society i have decided... All those who used to take your name with fear will start asking where is he from now on! That's what I will do! Hey Raana, you are my brother dude... You messed it up even more, dude! Suri's boys won't leave you alone... Even if they did, you think the cops will stay quiet? If they file a criminal case, your entire career is over even before it begins! Only if people outside get to know, right? Slow... You asked for 10 crore rupees for starting a mutton-pork mixing plant There will be a clue with just one murder and here we are talking about so many to be murdered & disposed of...That would be very difficult. There would have to be at least one clue available, sir... So, what do you think would have happened? Well, there is not a chance that he would have anything to do with it, sir.. Let us let him off the hook... Hey, release him... Sir, That Pacchi who was with Kapali has snuck a lot of money under his nose. Both Kapali & Suri knew about it. Something has happened between the three of them, sir. What could have happened? Hey... Get up, lad... get up... Why fall at my feet? You will always have my blessings... Look, see to it that no harm comes this boy's way. Thank you, sir! You want to become a cop, right? Yes, sir! Salute me after you join the duty! You can go now... Okay sir... Thank you, sir! All this has to be investigated unofficially... got it? Okay, sir! Oh, my daughter - Rajani... My sweetheart! Sir, please don't ask her anything. Have it. Please don't feel bad its ok sir as I don't know how to thank you! Mahesh.. As a token of appreciation, please accept this. Please! Sir, despite all the money at your disposal, it couldn't get your daughter back! My father always used to say that I should earn from my hardwork & efforts and not for helping others. Your blessings would suffice, sir! I will take leave!
