GOD HAS A PECULIAR WAY OF TESTING YOU WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT. WHEN I ARRIVED IN HAVERILL, A SMALL TOWN IN THE GREEN HILLS OF VERMONT, THE CHURCH WAS DECLINING AND IN DESPERATE NEED OF HELP. I HAD PRAYED FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT OF NEW YORK, WHERE I WAS JUST ANOTHER FACE IN A CROWD... STEP INTO A COMMUNITY THAT NEEDED A RESURGENCE OF FAITH AND IDENTITY... ...WHERE I COULD MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE. I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT CHANGE COMES FROM A GRASSROOTS EFFORT AND THAT A CONGREGATION GROWS WITH THE YOUNGER GENERATION. SO I STARTED A MUSICAL YOUTH GROUP CALLED THE SERMONS. WE'D PRACTICE A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK AND PERFORM REGULARLY FOR THE TOURISTS WHO VISIT FOR THE OVERPRICED ANTIQUES, ICE CREAM, AND MAPLE SYRUP. DURING THE SUNDAY SERVICES, CONCERNS STILL OUTNUMBER THE JOYS, AND SOMETIMES I WISH MY CONGREGANTS WOULD TAKE A LITTLE PROZAC WITH THEIR PRAYER. THE DOWNSIDE TO LIFE IN A SMALL TOWN IS EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW EACH OTHER'S BUSINESS. SECRETS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS ARE EVENTUALLY EXPOSED. TAKE THE HAYWARDS. THEY APPEARED TO HAVE IT ALL... THE ALL-AMERICAN FAMILY... ...BLESSED WITH GOOD HEALTH AND A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER, KATIE. SHE WAS EVERY PARENT'S DREAM... ...KIND-HEARTED, RESPONSIBLE, AND SMART. GEORGE OWNED A SUCCESSFUL CHAIN OF SPORTING-GOOD STORES ACROSS THE STATE... EVERY WOMAN'S DREAM. ALICE WAS A HOMEMAKER, AND SHE WAS ACTIVE IN OUR CHURCH, LOYAL AND STRONG. THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH BEING ON THE OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN... YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW. OH, HEY, EMMET. HI, CATHERINE. WHAT DO WE GOT? GEORGE HAYWARD STRANGLED HIS WIFE, ALICE, AND THEN SHOT HIMSELF. OH, MY GOD. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN YOU LOOK SHOCKED BEFORE. THEY SEEMED LIKE THE PERFECT COUPLE, LIKE, UH, REAL NORMAN ROCKWELL STUFF. DANCE STARTS IN THE DINING ROOM, AND IT ENDS RIGHT HERE. LOOKS LIKE SHE PUT UP QUITE A FIGHT ALONG THE WAY... A LOT OF BLOODY SKIN UNDER HER FINGERNAILS APPEAR TO MATCH MARKS ON HIM... WHAT'S LEFT OF HIM. THEIR DAUGHTER... WHERE'S KATIE? HAS SHE BEEN BY HERE? SPENT THE NIGHT AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE... TINA. TINA'S MOTHER, GINNY, IS THE ONE WHO ACTUALLY FOUND THE BODIES. ALICE WAS APPARENTLY LATE FOR SOME CHURCH THING, SO GINNY CALLS, NO ANSWER, COMES TO CHECK ON HER. IT SEEMS MR. HAYWARD WAS QUITE A DRINKER... BEER BOTTLES EVERYWHERE. PLACE SMELLS LIKE A FRAT HOUSE ON A SUNDAY MORNING. HOW'S THAT FIT INTO YOUR NORMAN ROCKWELL PICTURE? IT DOESN'T. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAND? THE DOG BIT ME. WELL, DID YOU CALL ANIMAL CONTROL? NO. I DIDN'T HAVE TO. PASTOR SHOWED UP. WHOA. WATCH IT. DOG DOESN'T SEEM TO MIND HIM. MM. Stand by. DISPATCH, THIS IS BURNHAM 23, LEAVING THE SCENE IN MAYBE 10 MINUTES. Stand by. WATCH THAT DOG, GUYS. CATHERINE. PASTOR. GINNY CALLED, HYSTERICAL. I THOUGHT I'D COME BY AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING I COULD DO TO HELP. HOW ABOUT GETTING THAT DOG OUT OF HERE? NAH, WE'RE GOOD. ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE HER BACK TO KATIE. THANKS, PASTOR. WE APPRECIATE IT. NEWS TRAVELS FAST. WELL, SMALL TOWN. LET'S GO. OH, I'M SO GLAD YOU COULD BE HERE FOR ALICE. THANK YOU. GOD BLESS YOU. HELLO, MR. JOHNSON. THANK YOU GUYS FOR COMING. THANK YOU. NOW, KATIE, YOU SURE I CAN'T TALK YOU INTO TAKING THE PLUNGE? TWO FOR THE PRICE OF ONE TODAY? YEAH, I THINK IT'S JUST MOM TODAY. ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA STAY ON YOU, YOUNG LADY. THANKS. HE'S SO EXCITED. I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE, SWEETIE. YEAH, ME, TOO. READY? YEAH, I AM. ALICE HAYWARD, DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR? I DO. AND DO YOU INTEND TO FOLLOW HIM ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE? I DO. LEAN BACK. THERE. HOW IS SHE? HER DAD JUST CHOKED HER MOM TO DEATH AND BLEW HIS HEAD OFF. HOW DO YOU THINK SHE'S DOING? GINNY, WE HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER FOR KATIE. HI, PASTOR DREW. IN. I'M SO SORRY. I'M HERE FOR YOU, KATIE. I'M HERE FOR YOU. WE SHARED SOMETHING DEEPLY PROFOUND TODAY. I WISH I COULD HUG YOU. YOU CAN HUG ME, ALICE. MM. I'LL GET SOME ICED TEA. OH! I AM SO PROUD OF YOU. I KNOW THIS SORT OF THING ISN'T VERY COOL. NO, IT'S COOL IF YOU DO IT. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS REALLY COOL? THE FRAY. AND, UH, THEY'RE GIVING A CONCERT TONIGHT IN ALBANY. WOW. AND I WON TWO TICKETS. THAT IS GREAT. YOU'RE IN ON THIS. I THOUGHT KATIE COULD STAY WITH US AFTERWARD. YOU HAD A BIG DAY. YOU DESERVE SOME PEACE. PLEASE? DID YOU WANT TO CHECK WITH DAD? OH, WHY? I KNOW HE'D SAY YES. NO. GO. HAVE FUN. REALLY? THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BUT NO DRINKING, NO SMOKING. NOPE. AND GET ME A T-SHIRT. I LOVE THE FRAY. YOU'RE THE COOLEST MOM EVER. I'LL BE CAREFUL WHEN I DRIVE, OKAY? OKAY. ARE YOU SURE YOU'LL BE OKAY TONIGHT? YEAH, OF COURSE. HAVE FUN. HI, HEATHER. NICE TO SEE YOU. YOU DID IT. NO ONE CAN TAKE THIS AWAY FROM YOU. LET'S TALK LATER. STOP BY NEXT TIME YOU'RE SHOPPING. OKAY. ALICE. HEATHER. YOU CAME. I DIDN'T WANT TO MISS THIS SPECIAL MOMENT FOR YOU. I STAYED IN THE BACK. I DIDN'T WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION. THIS IS FOR YOU... A GANESH, TO HELP REMOVE ALL OBSTACLES FROM YOUR PATH. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU. HEATHER LaROCHE CAME TO MY BAPTISM. YES, I SEE. HELLO, MISS LaROCHE. HI. NICE TO MEET YOU. WHAT DID YOU THINK? IMMERSION, INCLUSION. YOU GOT RID OF THE BIBLE. COULD HAVE BEEN A PAGAN RITUAL. DOES THAT MEAN YOU LIKED IT? IT MEANS OUR BELIEFS AREN'T ALWAYS AS FAR APART AS ONE MIGHT THINK. IS YOUR HUSBAND HERE? I WANTED TO MEET HIM. NO, HE, UM... HE WANTED TO COME, BUT HE HAD TO WORK. SO WE'LL HAVE A CELEBRATORY DINNER TONIGHT. MORE PIE FOR US, RIGHT? YEAH. SO, YOU GOT BAPTIZED TODAY? MM-HMM. REALLY? THOUGHT WE HAD DISCUSSED IT. WE DID. AND I INVITED YOU. YOU MUST HAVE JUST FORGOTTEN. LET'S EAT. WHAT, YOU WENT IN THE RIVER? YEAH.YOU ACTUALLY GOT IN THE WATER? YEAH. SO, WHO WAS THERE? UM... THANKS... THE WOMEN'S CIRCLE FROM THE CHURCH AND GINNY, OF COURSE. OF COURSE. WHO ELSE? OH, HEATHER LaROCHE. COME ON. WHAT, THE CRACKPOT WHO WRITES ABOUT ANGELS? WOW. SO, WHO ELSE? KATIE. MM-HMM. WHO YOU LET GO TO A CONCERT TONIGHT... WITHOUT ASKING ME? IT'S NOT THE DARK AGES, GEORGE. I DON'T HAVE TO ASK YOUR PERMISSION. EXCUSE ME? WELL, WHEN IT COMES TO OUR DAUGHTER, YOU DO, RIGHT? JUST GOT USED TO MAKING DECISIONS ON MY OWN WHEN YOU WERE AWAY. WH... WHILE I WAS AWAY? WHAT? NO, YOU THREW ME OUT. REMEMBER? YOU THREW ME DOWN THE STAIRS AND BROKE MY ARM. SO, WHAT, THIS IS HOW YOU TALK TO ME NOW? WELL, AT LEAST I DIDN'T PRESS CHARGES. YOU KNOW, YOU COULD THANK ME FOR THAT. THANK YOU? WOW. SO, I GO AWAY FOR, WHAT, FOUR MONTHS, I COME BACK, EVERYTHING HERE IS DIFFERENT. YOU HAVE A NEW OUTFIT. YOU HAVE A NEW HAIRDO. YOU HAVE A NEW ATTITUDE. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE? WHAT WERE YOU WEARING AT THE BAPTISM? NEVER MIND. EAT. I FORGOT THE SALAD. I SAID, "WHAT WERE YOU WEARING"? GEORGE, PLEASE... JUST TELL ME. A LONG SHIRT OVER A BATHING SUIT. SO YOU MADE A SPECTACLE OF YOURSELF. IT WAS A SACRED CEREMONY. IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE TOWN. IT WAS NOT THE ENTIRE TOWN. A WET SHIRT... EVERYONE SEE HOW TURNED ON YOU WERE? I WASN'T TURNED ON, GEORGE. BY HIM, HUH? BY YOUR PASTOR. YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS. AAH! OW. OKAY. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO THAT CHURCH ANYMORE. AAH! STOP IT, GEORGE. PASTOR DREW, YOU'RE BACK. YEAH, I NEED TO PICK UP A FEW THINGS FOR KATIE, AND I THOUGHT I'D CLEAN UP IF YOU WERE GUYS ARE DONE. WELL, WE ALREADY ORDERED A CLEAN-UP FOR TOMORROW. WELL, I'D LIKE TO GET IN THERE IF I CAN. I'D HATE TO RISK KATIE SEEING IT. UH... MY GUYS ARE DONE. OKAY? YEAH. IT IS PRETTY GRUESOME IN THERE. THERE'S A LOT OF BLOOD, PASTOR. I CAN HANDLE IT. OKAY. I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD CLEAN MY HOUSE. MRS. BENINCASA? YES? I'M HEATHER LaROCHE. I WAS A FRIEND OF ALICE HAYWARD'S. AH. I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU. COME IN. SIT DOWN. THANK YOU. I JUST FEEL SO SICK ABOUT THIS. JUST BEEN TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF IT. I WAS... I WAS HOPING YOU COULD TELL ME SOMETHING. I'M SORRY. I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT AT THIS TIME. WERE YOU A FRIEND OF GEORGE'S, AS WELL? NO, NO, JUST ALICE. IN FACT, WE ONLY BECAME FRIENDS IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, BUT I FELT LIKE WE'D KNOWN EACH OTHER A LONG TIME. SHE, UM... SHE CAME TO MY SHOP ONE AFTERNOON. SHE APPEARED TO BE LOST, LOOKING FOR SOMETHING... OR SOMEONE TO HELP HER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, ALICE DIDN'T TALK MUCH ABOUT HER PRIVATE LIFE. HER RELATIONSHIP WITH GEORGE SEEMED OFF LIMITS. DID SHE SAY WHY? NO. WE... WHEN ALICE AND I WERE GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER, IT WAS WHILE THEY WERE SEPARATED. UM, THEY GOT BACK TOGETHER JUST... JUST BEFORE HER BAPTISM. UH, WHEN WAS SHE BAPTIZED? YESTERDAY. SHE WAS SO HAPPY. DO YOU KNOW ANYONE ELSE WHO COULD TELL US MORE ABOUT ALICE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH GEORGE? GINNY McBRADDEN. THEY WERE BEST FRIENDS. WHY? 'CAUSE HE BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF HER FOR YEARS. HE WHIPPED HER LIKE A DOG. I HAD NO IDEA. NO ONE DID. SHE WAS EMBARRASSED BY IT, ASHAMED. BUT EVENTUALLY SHE'D HAD ENOUGH AND THREW HIM OUT? YEAH, AND THEN AFTER A FEW MONTHS, SHE LET HIM COME BACK. AND YOU KNOW THE REST. SORRY. JUST BE A MOMENT. I APPRECIATE YOU NOT BOTHERING KATIE WITH ALL OF THIS. SHE'S BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH. DID, UH... DID GEORGE EVER HIT KATIE? NO. HE LOVED THAT GIRL. AND SHE LOVED HIM. SHE WAS HIS LITTLE PRINCESS. HE NEVER EVEN TOUCHED ALICE WHEN SHE WAS AROUND. AND THEY CERTAINLY SEEMED TO KNOW HOW TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES. YOU COULD SAY THAT. SHE DID CONFIDE IN YOU? SURE. AND SHE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT HER MARRIAGE? SOME OF IT. BUT SHE KNEW I HAD ZERO SYMPATHY FOR THAT MAN, NONE. I CHEERED WHEN SHE KICKED HIM OUT. AND I CURSED WHEN SHE BROUGHT HIM BACK, AT WHICH POINT SHE STOPPED TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT. SO THIS WAS A WOMAN WHO HAD NO ONE TO CONFIDE IN AND NOWHERE TO GO. OH, SHE HAD SOMEWHERE TO GO... PASTORAL COUNSELING. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? ASK STEPHEN DREW. UM, COME ON. WE GOT TO GO. OKAY. UH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. YEAH, OKAY, WE'RE ON OUR WAY. WELL, THAT'S INTERESTING. WHAT'S GOING ON? THAT WAS THE MEDICAL EXAMINER. GEORGE HAYWARD DIDN'T SHOOT HIMSELF. SOMEONE ELSE DID. THE ENTRANCE WOUND HAS A DOWNWARD TRAJECTORY OF A 90-DEGREE ANGLE. THE BLOOD SPATTER'S INCONGRUENT WITH THE WOUND ENTERING FROM ANY OTHER ANGLE. YEAH, BUT THE GUY WAS DRUNK. THE GUN COULD HAVE SLIPPED. NOT ALL SUICIDES ARE TEXTBOOK. THERE WAS NO BLOWBACK ON THE GUN. THERE WAS NO RESIDUE ON HIS HAND. SO, DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE SHOT CAME FROM? THE SHOT CAME IN HERE, FROM BEHIND AND ABOVE. OKAY, SO, THEY'RE HAVING DINNER, THEY HAVE A FIGHT, IT ESCALATES, HE STRANGLES HER, SOMEONE COMES IN TO STOP IT, IT'S TOO LATE, AND THEN... EXCEPT SHE DIED FOUR HOURS BEFORE HE DID. ALL RIGHT, SO, HE KILLS HER, THEN GETS LOADED FOR A FEW HOURS... PASSES OUT. SOMEONE DISCOVERS THEM... ...AND DECIDES TO EXACT A LITTLE RETRIBUTION. WHOEVER DID IT WIPED THE GUN DOWN AND PUT IT IN GEORGE'S HAND BEFORE TAKING OFF. IT ALL FITS. YEP. COOL. UH, ONE MORE THING... ALICE'S LOWER BACK WAS COVERED WITH FRESH CONTUSIONS, 24 TO 48 HOURS OLD. HER KIDNEYS ARE BADLY BRUISED. SO, YOU'RE SAYING THAT GEORGE BEAT HER A DAY OR TWO BEFORE HE KILLED HER? SON OF A BITCH. SO, MY DAD DIDN'T KILL HIMSELF, THEN. SOMEONE SHOT HIM WHEN HE WAS ASLEEP. KATIE, HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS WHEN HE DIED. HE WOULDN'T HAVE FELT A THING. SO, WHO WOULD WANT TO KILL MY DAD, THEN? SOMEONE WHO WAS ANGRY WITH HIM FOR WHAT HE DID TO YOUR MOTHER. CAN YOU THINK OF ANYBODY WHO... LIKE... LIKE A FRIEND OR SOMETHING, LIKE... YEAH, SOMEONE WHO WAS CLOSE TO YOUR MOM. MOM DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF CLOSE FRIENDS. NO ONE AT ALL? THEY LOOK SO HAPPY HERE. YOU KNOW, I WISH THAT SOMEBODY HAD A RECORDER AT MY MOM'S BAPTISM. SHE WAS SO HAPPY, AND SHE WASN'T AFRAID ANYMORE. OF YOUR DAD? OR ELSE SHE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT, YOU KNOW? DONE WHAT? GOT BAPTIZED. OH. SHE KNEW THAT HE'D GET MAD, AND SHE JUST DIDN'T CARE. AND WHAT DID YOUR DAD THINK OF STEPHEN DREW? OH, UH, HE HATED HIM. COME ON, GIRLS. WE HAVE TO GO. KATIE. WHAT'S WRONG? I THINK SHE WANTS TO BE LEFT ALONE. HTH? HOW DO WE GATHER IN THE PLACE WHERE SHE WORSHIPPED, SHE LOVED SO MUCH, SHE DID SUCH GOOD WORK, AND NOT HAVE HER AMONG US? WELL, SHE IS WITH US. SHE'S ALL AROUND US. SHE'S IN OUR HEARTS... OUR MEMORY... GOOD WORK... AND... CERTAINLY IN HER BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER, KATIE. YOU KNOW, YOUR SMILE REMINDS ME OF ONE OF YOUR MOTHER'S GIFTS. SHE COULD ALWAYS TAKE A NEGATIVE AND TURN IT INTO A POSITIVE. YOU RECALL THE, UM... THE QUILT THAT THE WOMEN'S CIRCLE MADE. TOOK THEM ABOUT A YEAR. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL QUILT. AND THEY WERE GONNA RAFFLE IT OFF AT THE SUMMER FAIR. AND A FERAL CAT FROM THE CEMETERY FOUND ITS WAY TO THAT QUILT, AND SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A BEAUTIFUL LITTER. OF COURSE, THE QUILT WAS RUINED, BUT ALICE JUST LOOKED AT IT AND SAID, "THANK GOD THE KITTENS WERE WARM." "AND THANK GOD THE KITTENS WERE SAFE." I COULD IMAGINE THERE WERE TIMES IN ALICE'S LIFE WHERE SHE DIDN'T FEEL SAFE. BUT I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE SHE'S SAFE NOW. YOU ARE WELCOME TO COME UP AND PAY YOUR RESPECTS TO OUR BEAUTIFUL ALICE AFTER THE FAMILY. HEY, MOM. I LOVE YOU. Katie. HOW YOU HOLDING UP... ALL RIGHT? YEAH. THANKS. HONEY, WHAT'S UP? HE'S HIDING SOMETHING. THANK YOU, VICKY. PASTOR. EXCUSE ME. WOULD YOU HAVE A MINUTE TO TALK ABOUT ALICE HAYWARD? YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY. I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND. I DO. I'LL JUST WALK WITH YOU, IF YOU DON'T MIND. GINNY McBRADDEN SAID THAT YOU COUNSELED ALICE, SO I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT. I'M SORRY. YOU WERE AWARE THAT ALICE WAS BEING ABUSED BY GEORGE, CORRECT? I COUNSELED HER MANY TIMES ABOUT HER MARRIAGE. THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY. DID YOU EVER DO ANYTHING TO INTERVENE? NO. WAS ALICE SEEING ANYBODY ELSE WHILE SHE WAS SEPARATED? I'LL REMIND YOU ALICE WAS BURIED TODAY. PLEASE SHOW A LITTLE RESPECT. AND I'LL REMIND YOU THAT WE ARE JUST CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION. NOW, SOMEBODY SHOT GEORGE AFTER GEORGE KILLED ALICE, SO MAYBE SHE MENTIONED ANOTHER MAN DURING HER COUNSELING WITH YOU. MAYBE HE KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT IT. CATHERINE, I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT. ALL RIGHT. EARLIER LAST YEAR, ALICE KICKED GEORGE OUT OF THE HOUSE, AND THEN SHE TOOK HIM BACK. BOY, YOU KEEP GOING, HUH? CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT? THERE'S NO NEED TO PATRONIZE ME. BUT HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT, AFTER ALICE FINALLY GOT THE COURAGE TO KICK GEORGE OUT AND THEN SHE TURNED AROUND AND TOOK HIM BACK? THAT MUST HAVE UPSET YOU. GEORGE WAS A DANGEROUS MAN, AND I TOLD HER THAT MANY TIMES. CATHERINE, THIS IS A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY. OTHER THAN THAT, THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU. ALICE'S SPIRIT HAS NOW BEEN RELEASED. SHE'S NOW ONE WITH THE LIGHT, WITH THE AIR... AND THE SKY. SHE HAS ENTERED THE REALM OF ANGELS, AND THEY HAVE WELCOMED HER. LET THE GOODNESS OF ALICE'S HEART EXPAND OUR HEARTS. LET ALICE AND THE ANGELS COME TO US, INSPIRE US, REMIND US THAT THERE IS LIFE IN THE AIR WE BREATHE... ...LIFE IN THE LIGHT WE SEEK. LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO CLOSE OUR EYES AND FEEL ALICE'S ENERGY SURROUND US. HI, THERE. HI. CAN I HELP YOU? I, UH... I WALK BY YOUR STORE ALL THE TIME. I'VE... I'VE NEVER HAD THE NERVE TO COME IN BEFORE. WELL, YOU'RE HERE NOW. COME ON IN. GREAT. TAKE A LOOK AROUND. I'M HEATHER. YEAH, I KNOW. WE ALL KNOW. I'VE READ ALL YOUR BOOKS AND I'VE SEEN YOUR INTERVIEWS ON TV AND ONCE I EVEN... I WROTE HOW MUCH I LIKED YOUR WORK ON ONE OF THOSE ONLINE BOOKSTORES. OH. THANKS FOR DOING THAT. I DON'T... I STOPPED READING THOSE AWHILE AGO. SOME PEOPLE CAN BE KIND OF NASTY. I PROMISE YOU, YOUR BOOKS HAVE HELPED SO MANY PEOPLE. IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL IN HERE. IT'S SO PEACEFUL. THANK YOU. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME. OH, MY GOD... ALICE, ALICE HAYWARD. IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU. HI. IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU, ALICE. IT WAS GREAT. WE TALKED ABOUT SPIRITUALITY AND ABOUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. YOU SHOULD READ THE BOOK. SHE TALKS ABOUT CHRIST AS A PROPHET, LIKE BUDDHA OR KRISHNA. SHE SAYS THAT WE'RE ALL ONE, ALL A PART OF THE UNIVERSE. HMM. I DON'T CARE WHAT THE HELL SHE SAID, AS LONG AS IT INSPIRED YOU TO KICK GEORGE OUT. I STILL THINK YOU SHOULD GET A RESTRAINING ORDER. I DON'T NEED TO. ALICE, HE'S NOT GONNA CHANGE. YOU NEED TO START PROTECTING YOURSELF. GINNY, HE KNOWS HE WENT TOO FAR. HE DOES. THAT'S WHY HE'S STAYING AWAY. WHAT IF HE COMES BACK? IT HASN'T BEEN THAT LONG. I DON'T WANT TO PRESS CHARGES. I DON'T WANT PEOPLE KNOWING. OH, PEOPLE KNOW. GINNY, PLEASE. NOT FOR MY SAKE, BUT FOR KATIE'S, OKAY? THANK YOU FOR THE PRAYER CIRCLE. I CAN SEE WHY ALICE LOVED IT. WELL, I'M JUST SORRY KATIE WASN'T ABLE TO MAKE IT. I ENCOURAGED HER TO COME, BUT IT'S JUST TOO SOON FOR HER. YEAH. HOW'S SHE DOING, ANYWAY? WELL, SHE'S A STRONG KID, BUT SHE'S... SHE'S REALLY SUFFERING. SHE WON'T COME OUT OF HER ROOM. I-I... I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO FOR HER. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT THIS MUST BE FOR HER. PLEASE TELL HER TO COME BY ANYTIME. YOU KNOW, YOU AND ALICE REALLY CONNECTED. WHY DON'T YOU COME SEE HER? WELL, I DON'T WANT TO IMPOSE IF SHE'D RATHER BE ALONE. SHE WON'T TALK TO ANYONE. I CAN'T SEEM TO GET THROUGH TO HER. MAYBE SHE'LL TALK WITH YOU. I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PASTOR. I DON'T TRUST HIM. HE'S EDGY WITH ME. HE'S DEFENSIVE. WHAT ABOUT THE BEST FRIEND? WOULDN'T SHE HAVE JUST AS MUCH MOTIVE? WELL, SHE DOES COME RIGHT OUT AND SAY HOW MUCH SHE HATED GEORGE, BUT THE KIDS WERE BEST FRIENDS, AND SHE ADORES KATIE. SO, NO MATTER HOW MUCH SHE MAY HAVE DESPISED GEORGE, I DON'T SEE HER DOING THAT TO KATIE. MY GUT SAYS STEPHEN DREW. WELL, DON'T LET YOUR GUT INTERFERE WITH BUILDING A CASE. FOCUS ON THE LAW. WE DON'T WANT A WITCH HUNT. OH, I FORGOT... IT'S AN ELECTION YEAR. YOU'RE JUST WORRIED HOW IT'LL LOOK TO THE VOTERS. YOU KNOW, NO ONE ELSE COULD GET AWAY WITH SAYING THAT TO ME. AW, COME ON, JIM. THAT'S WHY YOU HIRED ME. CATHERINE, I'M SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. SO AM I, JIM. LOOK... WE ALL KNOW THAT GEORGE HAYWARD WAS AN AWFUL MAN. HE BEAT HIS WIFE, AND THEN HE KILLED HER, FOR GOD'S SAKE. BUT HE WAS PASSED OUT WHEN SOMEONE PUT A BULLET THROUGH HIS HEAD, AND I DON'T CARE IF IT WAS THE COUNTRY PASTOR WHO DID IT. I CARE THAT SOMEONE DID IT. MURDER IS MURDER. THAT'S WHY I HIRED YOU. MY MOM WAS CHANGING, WASN'T SHE? SHE WAS BECOMING REALLY INDEPENDENT. BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT PUSHED HER AWAY FROM MY DAD. I THINK SO, YEAH. BUT THEN SHE GOT TO DISCOVER SOME OF THE ANGELS IN HER LIFE. I THINK THAT'S WHY SHE HUNG OUT WITH YOU AND PASTOR DREW SO MUCH. WELL, IF YOU'RE SUGGESTING WE WERE HER ANGELS, I'M AFRAID WE DIDN'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB. WELL, I'M GLAD THAT SHE HAD YOU GUYS, ANYWAY. ME, TOO. WHAT IS IT? YOU KNOW THAT THING YOU GAVE MY MOM AT THE PICNIC? YEAH. THE GANESH? YEAH. I WAS TALKING TO GINNY, AND I SAID THAT IT SHOULD GO IN HER CASKET. I THINK SHE REALLY WOULD HAVE LIKED IT THERE. BUT THE THING IS PASTOR DREW WANTED HER TO HAVE HIS BIBLE. LIKE, HIS PERSONAL BIBLE? YEAH. WOW. I DIDN'T WANT MY MOM TO LIE THERE FOREVER WITH A BIBLE IN HER HANDS, EVEN IF IT WAS HIS. DOES HE KNOW THAT? OH, NO. CAN WE NOT TELL HIM? 'CAUSE, I MEAN, HE THINKS IT'S WITH HER AND... I WOULDN'T TELL HIM. THANKS. PASTOR. SO TRANQUIL HERE, SO SAFE. NO WONDER ALICE LIKED IT. STEPHEN DREW IN MY SHOP. HMM. WELL, I WANTED TO COME AND, WELL, JUST BE AROUND PEOPLE THAT SHE KNEW, PEOPLE THAT SHE LIKED. WELL, GINNY AND ALICE WERE MUCH CLOSER. YEAH, BUT ALICE WAS INSPIRED BY YOU. I MEAN, SHE SEEMED TO SEE A CONNECTION BETWEEN OUR BELIEFS. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT IS. WELL, THEY'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT. I COULD START WITH ANGELS. I THINK YOU AND I PROBABLY VIEW THEM IN MUCH THE SAME WAY... CELESTIAL GUIDES AND PROTECTORS. WHERE WERE ALICE'S ANGELS? I DON'T KNOW. I WISH I COULD HAVE DONE MORE FOR HER. MM. ME, TOO. GINNY, EXCUSE ME. I HAVE SOME MORE QUESTIONS FOR YOU ABOUT THE NIGHT OF THE MURDERS. FOR ME? MM-HMM. WELL, THE PERSON YOU SHOULD BE SPEAKING TO IS DOWN AT AURASCAPES, PAYING A VISIT TO HEATHER LaROCHE. HEATHER LaROCHE? I HONORED STEPHEN'S REQUEST TO PROTECT KATIE, BUT I CANNOT GET PAST HIM FLIRTING WITH HEATHER ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE. ALL RIGHT, NOTED, BUT I NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOU WERE WHEN GEORGE HAYWARD WAS KILLED. IN MY BED, ASLEEP. CAN ANYONE VERIFY THAT? WHAT'S THIS ABOUT? GINNY... DID ALICE WRITE SOMETHING ABOUT ME IN HER JOURNAL? EXCUSE ME? YOU HAVEN'T FOUND ALICE'S JOURNAL? IT'S IN HER HOUSE SOMEWHERE, AND I'M SURE WHATEVER SHE WROTE ABOUT ME IS MUCH LESS INTERESTING THAN WHATEVER SHE WROTE ABOUT THE AFFAIR. GEORGE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR? HELLO? ALICE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR? WITH WHO? TAKE A BIG GUESS. I'VE BEEN COMING TO YOUR CHURCH FOR THREE YEARS, BUT I'VE NEVER REALLY KNOWN ANYTHING ABOUT YOU UNTIL NOW. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I'M SURE YOU DON'T. WHAT IS THAT? ALICE'S JOURNAL. SHE STARTED KEEPING IT RIGHT AFTER SHE THREW GEORGE OUT. AND IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT, DURING THAT TIME, PASTORAL COUNSELING WASN'T THE ONLY THING SHE GOT FROM YOU. IS THIS UNCOMFORTABLE FOR YOU? I NEVER MEANT FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. THAT'S THE TRUTH. I SWEAR TO GOD. I KICKED HIM OUT. BUT I'M SCARED. OF WHAT? WHETHER I MADE THE RIGHT DECISION OR NOT. MONTHS GO BY, AND GEORGE IS WONDERFUL. HE'S TENDER. LONG STRETCHES WHERE EVERYTHING'S FINE. IT COMES IN PEAKS AND VALLEYS. HE GETS SO ANGRY. AND THEN HE CALMS. BUT HE TRICKS YOU WITH THAT CALM. YOU THINK IT'S SAFE, AND THEN SUDDENLY, JUST OUT OF NOWHERE, HE RAGES. I THINK YOU'RE VERY COURAGEOUS. I CAN'T HAVE KATIE THINKING THIS IS NORMAL. IT'S MY FAULT. NO. IT'S DAMAGED HER. THEY USED TO BE SO CLOSE, BUT LATELY I FEEL HER PULLING AWAY. IT MUST CHIP AWAY HER LOVE FOR HIM. I'M SURE IT DOES. I HATE MYSELF FOR THAT. NO. I WANT TO BE A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR HER. I DON'T WANT HER REPEATING MY MISTAKES. GOOD. YOU KNOW, UNDER HIS ANGER, GEORGE... HE'S A GOOD MAN. ALICE. NO, HE IS. I SEE IT IN HIS EYES WHEN HE APOLOGIZES. HE JUST... HE WRITES POETRY ASKING FOR MY FORGIVENESS. HURTING ME DOESN'T MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD. IT JUST MAKES HIM HATE HIMSELF MORE. WELL, I'M SURE HE FEELS THAT, BUT, ALICE, YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO STAY STRONG AND FOLLOW THROUGH. DON'T TAKE HIM BACK. I'M SORRY. IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO TELL YOU THAT. OF COURSE IT IS. I RESPECT YOUR OPINION. IT'S JUST NOT SO EASY. I MEAN, HE'S MY HUSBAND. I MADE VOWS BEFORE GOD. GOD DOESN'T WANT YOU IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP, VOWS OR NO VOWS. I'M SO WEAK. NO, YOU'RE NOT WEAK. YOU ARE STRONG. YOU ARE INCREDIBLY STRONG. THANK YOU. HOW DOES YOUR WRIST FEEL? STIFF, BUT AT LEAST IT'S OFF, RIGHT? OH, SINGLE LIFE SUITS YOU. I'm not single. I'M SEPARATED. OKAY. WHATEVER YOU ARE, YOU'RE LOOKING GREAT. I FEEL GREAT. IT'S SUCH A LUXURY, NOT BEING AFRAID. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE TAKE THIS SORT OF THING FOR GRANTED. I WANT TO CELEBRATE. I JUST DON'T WANT ANYTHING BAD TO HAPPEN TO YOU. NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN. ALL THE BAD STUFF IS BEHIND ME. I CAN FEEL IT. HAS HE CONTACTED YOU? NO. NO, HE'S BEING VERY RESPECTFUL. LET'S HAVE A SUNDAE. COME ON! HI, HONEY. HOW WAS SCHOOL? SIT DOWN. I GOT YOU A SNACK. WHAT'S WRONG? IS HE COMING BACK? YOU WANT HIM TO? YEAH. HERE. THANKS. IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU WITHOUT YOUR iPOD AND THOSE THINGS IN YOUR EARS AND... HEADPHONES? YEAH. YEAH. THEY BLOCK US OUT. I'M SORRY. OH, HONEY, IT'S MY FAULT. MOM, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, OKAY? OKAY. THINGS ARE GONNA BE DIFFERENT FROM NOW ON, BABY. I PROMISE YOU. OKAY. - HI. - HI. HOW WAS THE BOOK SIGNING? GOT HER TO AUTOGRAPH IT FOR YOU. "TO PASTOR DREW, "MAY YOUR AURA FOREVER GLOW BRIGHTLY AND ILLUMINE THE SKY." "THE SKY."YES, YES, "THE SKY." THIS SKY? THE SKY OR... THIS SKY... DON'T DISMISS IT OUT OF HAND. I READ IT, AND IT'S EXPANSIVE AND THRILLING 'CAUSE IT'S NOT PUNITIVE. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT BASED IN REDEMPTION OR GUILT. IT'S JUST ABOUT BEING PRESENT, HERE AND NOW. MM-HMM. OH... YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HER. WANT SOME TEA? YES, PLEASE. YOU KNOW I WANT A SPIRITUAL CONNECTION, AND I'M JUST NOT COMPLETELY FULFILLED BY THE CHRISTIAN TEACHINGS. WELL, YOU CAN'T LEAVE THE CHURCH. I'D QUIT THE PARISH IN TWO SECONDS. REALLY? MM-HMM. YOU WOULD QUIT? BECAUSE I COULDN'T BEAR THE FACT OF LOOKING OUT OVER THAT PULPIT AND NOT SEEING YOUR FACE, THAT'S WHY. WHERE WOULD YOU GO? I DON'T KNOW. DESERTED ISLAND SOMEWHERE. MM-HMM. TALK TO COCONUTS. I'LL PREACH TO COCONUTS. HOW'S KATIE DOING? HOW'S SHE ADJUSTING? SHE'S HELD SO MUCH IN FOR SO LONG. NOW WHEN I SEE HER, SHE'S LIKE A LITTLE FLOWER JUST READY TO BLOSSOM. I COULD SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU. ANYWAY... WE'RE DOING MOTHER AND DAUGHTER THINGS TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL. THAT'S AMAZING. SOMETHING SO SMALL CAN SEEM SO BIG. I'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR YOU A LOT. GOD, IT JUST ALWAYS MAKES ME WANT TO CRY, TALKING ABOUT IT. ALICE, I CAN'T SEE HOW ANYONE WOULD WANT TO HURT YOU, EVER. I'M SO SORRY. NO. OH, MY GOD, I'M SO EMBARRASSED. IT'S OKAY. NO, IT'S OKAY. I'M NOT GONNA LIE. IT'S... IT'S NOT LIKE I'M NOT ATTRACTED TO YOU. LET'S JUST FORGET THIS EVER HAPPENED. NO. MMM. PLEASE REMIND ME WHO I AM. YOU SLEPT WITH STEPHEN DREW? THERE IS A WOMAN UNDER THESE FRUMPY CLOTHES. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. SO, UH, DETAILS? AMAZING! HE WAS SO GENEROUS AND SO PRESENT AND SO HOT. I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER BE ABLE TO LOOK AT HIM THE SAME WAY. ME, EITHER. IT'S ABOUT TIME. OH, GOD, THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, I NEVER THOUGHT OF MYSELF AS THE SORT OF WOMAN WHO GETS TO TAKE A LOVER. MMM. "TAKE A LOVER." I TOOK A LOVER. AND IT WAS GOOD. IN MY LIFE, THINGS HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER. I'M ABLE TO LAUGH AND PLAY WITH KATIE. WE'RE SPENDING SO MUCH MORE TIME TOGETHER. ♪ I'M JUST A HOLOGRAM ♪ YOU CAN SEE, BUT DON'T TOUCH ME, BABY ♪ ♪ OH, I BET YOU WANT ME ♪ I'M IN A LOVE AFFAIR WITHOUT A LOVE SONG ♪ ♪ I'M IN THE HABIT OF HAVING WHAT I DON'T WANT ♪ I NEVER REALIZED HOW MUCH I WAS MISSING, HOW MUCH I SHUT DOWN.

I DON'T THINK KATIE SUSPECTS ANYTHING, BUT I WON'T LIE IF SHE ASKS. THANK YOU. WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TO HIDE? YES, IT WOULD. WHAT WOULD GEORGE SAY? LET'S NOT THINK ABOUT THAT. IF HE EVER HURTS YOU AGAIN, I'LL KILL HIM. READ THE LAST LINE ON THAT PAGE RIGHT THERE, THAT LINE, OUT LOUD. "AND THEN STEPHEN SAID TO ME..." PASTOR. "STEPHEN SAID..." PASTOR. "AND THEN STEPHEN SAID TO ME..." "IF HE EVER HURTS YOU AGAIN, I'LL KILL HIM." "IF HE EVER HURTS YOU AGAIN, I'LL KILL HIM." ARE YOU ACTUALLY DENYING THAT YOU TOLD ALICE YOU'D KILL GEORGE IF HE EVER TOUCHED HER AGAIN? JUST BECAUSE I SAID SOMETHING DOESN'T MEAN I ACTUALLY DID IT. HOW DID THE AFFAIR END? READ FOR YOURSELF. WELL, ACTUALLY SHE DIDN'T WRITE ABOUT IT IN HER JOURNAL. I'M GUESSING SHE LOVED YOU TOO MUCH TO WRITE ANYTHING BAD ABOUT YOU. YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE JOURNAL, DID YOU? OTHERWISE, YOU SURELY WOULD HAVE GRABBED IT WHEN YOU WENT TO, UH, CLEAN THE HOUSE. YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT BARGING INTO A HOUSE OF WORSHIP, TREATING ME LIKE I'M ON TRIAL. I DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU... THE WORLD'S TIRED OF CLERGYMEN TAKING SEXUAL ADVANTAGE OF THEIR FLOCK. I DIDN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HER. YOU OUTRIGHT LIED ABOUT YOUR INVOLVEMENT WITH HER. WHAT ELSE ARE YOU LYING ABOUT? I DID NOT KILL GEORGE. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. HUH. YOU'VE GOT BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS. AND IN TIME, I'LL PROVE IT. GINNY, YOU TOLD CATHERINE BENINCASA ABOUT ALICE AND ME, DIDN'T YOU? ALL I SAID IS THAT ALICE KEPT A JOURNAL. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? YOU DON'T TRUST ME? NO. I DON'T TRUST YOU. YOU CONDEMNED HER TO DIE. OH, GINNY, DON'T SAY THAT.IT'S TRUE. YOU DAMN WELL KNOW IT. SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT HIM FOR YOU. SHE'D STILL BE WITH US. WE'D ALL STILL HAVE HER... YOU, ME, KATIE. SHE LOVED YOU. I KNOW. THERE. THERE. THERE. THERE. PLEASE TELL ME SHE WASN'T PREPARING TO DIE. WHAT HAVE I DONE? LORD, HELP ME. THANK YOU. THE JOURNAL PROVES HE'S LYING, EMMET. - LET'S DO IT. - You sure about this? YEAH. GET A SEARCH WARRANT. LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE STEPHEN DREW IS HIDING. You got it. WHOA. THIS PLACE IS A MESS. WHAT HAPPENED? UNEXPECTED VISITORS. THE POLICE? COME ON. SIT DOWN. TELL ME. TELL ME... HOW ARE YOU? I'M FINE. KATIE. I REALLY MISS MY MOM. AND MY DAD. PASTOR DREW. I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU. I JUST WENT BY YOUR PLACE. YEAH. I HEARD ABOUT THE POLICE GOING THROUGH IT. WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? CATHERINE BENINCASA HAS ME IN HER CROSS HAIRS. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG. SHE HAS NO EVIDENCE, BUT SHE NEEDS A VILLAIN, AND, UH, APPARENTLY SHE'S CHOSEN ME. NOT LIKE I HAVEN'T MADE MISTAKES IN MY LIFE, BUT I'M NO CRIMINAL. OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT A CRIMINAL. I'M GOING UP TO MY CABIN ON THE LAKE FOR A LITTLE WHILE. YOU SHOULD COME UP SOMEDAY THIS WEEK. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD USE A BREAK. THANKS. THAT'S SWEET. YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT. OKAY. YOU EXECUTED A WARRANT, AND IT TURNED UP NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE. WE FOUND HIS LAPTOP, AND WE DISCOVERED THAT HE SEARCHED WEBSITES LIKE, UM, "HOW TO REMOVE BLOOD STAINS," "THE BEST WAY TO CLEAN FINGERPRINTS," "GUN BLOWBACK." WE HAVE MOTIVE. WE HAVE FORENSIC EVIDENCE. YEAH, BUT NONE OF IT TIES HIM TO THE MURDER. AND HE WAS MERELY SEARCHING FORENSIC WEBSITES. HIS DNA, HIS FINGERPRINTS ARE ALL OVER THE HAYWARD HOUSE. CATHERINE, HE WAS SLEEPING WITH HER. THERE'S NOTHING ON THE GUN. HE SEARCHED THOSE WEBSITES AT 2:30 IN THE MORNING, AN HOUR AFTER GEORGE HAYWARD WAS SHOT. WHAT MORE DO I NEED? A WITNESS? A CONFESSION? EVERYTHING YOU HAVE IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL. WE HAVE GOTTEN CONVICTIONS WITH LESS, AND YOU KNOW IT. AND WE WON'T WITH THIS ONE, NOT WITH STEPHEN DREW. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HIM LIKE HE'S SOME KIND OF SAINT, I MEAN, LIKE HE'S UNTOUCHABLE. IF YOU GET THIS TO TRIAL, THE JURY WILL INTERPRET YOUR PASSION AS A PERSONAL VENDETTA BECAUSE THEY'LL TAKE ONE LOOK AT THAT GUY, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA SEE? THEY'RE GONNA SEE A HANDSOME, DECENT, HARDWORKING PASTOR WHO'S A BIG PART OF THIS COMMUNITY AND WHO'S DONE NOTHING BUT GOOD WORK HERE. HE'S GONNA WALK. AND YOUR REPUTATION AND MINE WILL TAKE A BIG HIT. YOU SHOULD COME UP SOMEDAY THIS WEEK. YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT. HEY, THERE YOU ARE. I WAS GETTING WORRIED. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO PICK ME UP AN HOUR AGO. DON'T WORRY. I LEFT MY SUITCASE IN THE TRUNK. NO ONE SAW ME COME IN. I, UH... I CALLED THE HOTEL. I GOT US AN UPGRADE. WHY NOT, RIGHT... OUR FIRST NIGHT AWAY TOGETHER? WHY DON'T I HELP YOU PACK? ALICE, SIT DOWN. ALICE... WE CAN'T CONTINUE. WHY NOT? WELL, IT'S... IT'S JUST ALL SO COMPLICATED. I MEAN, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE A MAN OF GOD. MAYBE IT'S GOD WILL. YOU'RE STILL MARRIED. AND THERE'S KATIE AND... AND THE CONGREGATION. I MEAN, WHAT WOULD THE CONGREGATION THINK OF ME? GEORGE HAS BEEN CALLING. HE WANTS TO COME HOME. NO, ALICE. HE AND I PROBABLY BELONG TOGETHER. I WON'T BE THE KIND OF WOMAN WHO SAYS SHE HAD NO IDEA WHEN SHE MARRIED THAT HER HUSBAND MIGHT BEAT HER. IT'S NAIVE. IT'S A COP-OUT. DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF. I'M NOT BEING HARD ON MYSELF. I'M JUST BEING REALISTIC. ALICE, YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT HIM. YOU'VE PROVEN THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT ATTRACTED ME TO GEORGE IN THE FIRST PLACE? HE COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT ME. HE MADE ME FEEL SPECIAL. HE NEEDED ME. YOU DON'T. HE'S A DANGEROUS MAN. WE CAN SAY A LOT OF BAD THINGS ABOUT GEORGE, COULDN'T WE? BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, HE LOVES ME. PLEASE DON'T GO BACK. IF THERE'S ONE THING I'VE LEARNED ABOUT BEING WITH YOU... IT'S THAT... I NEED TO BE LOVED. GEORGE HAS BEEN CALLING ME, PLEADING WITH ME TO GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE. SO MUCH PAIN IN HIS VOICE. I DON'T WANT TO PUT HIM THROUGH THAT ANYMORE. I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK IT COULD BE DIFFERENT, BUT I COULD MAKE IT WORK. JUST A LITTLE BIT FURTHER. EYES CLOSED, RIGHT? EYES CLOSED, EYES CLOSED. GEORGE, YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE SURPRISES. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS. TRUST ME. OKAY, A LITTLE FURTHER, A LITTLE FURTHER. AND OPEN YOUR EYES. I LOVE IT. YOU DO? WOW. SIT. AND I MADE THAT MYSELF. IT DIDN'T COME FROM A JAR. UH... OH, NO. WHAT? WHAT? IS IT TOO MUCH LIME? YOU KNOW, IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS. OKAY. WELL, WINE, RIGHT? THANK YOU. THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU. HONEY, I, UH... I NEVER MEANT TO HURT YOU. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? BUT I KNOW THAT I HAVE, OVER AND OVER AGAIN, AND I... IT MAKES ME HATE MYSELF. GEORGE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO... NO, I DO, OKAY? FROM THE FIRST MOMENT I SAW YOU, I KNEW THAT SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY WE HAD TO BE TOGETHER, I... I HAD TO HAVE YOU. AND I CROSSED THE LINE IN TRYING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN, TRYING TO KEEP YOU. GEORGE. HOW CAN YOU DO THIS? WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU? KATIE WANTS HIM TO COME HOME. KATIE IS A CHILD. SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. HE'S MADE CHANGES. HE'S HAD COUNSELING. THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR DOESN'T CHANGE WITH A LITTLE COUNSELING. TWO WEEKS AGO, YOU SAID YOU WERE FALLING IN LOVE WITH STEPHEN DREW. DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE. HE DUMPED YOU, DIDN'T HE? SON OF A BITCH. DON'T. DON'T RUIN IT. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. I'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE. I'M GRATEFUL. I WISH YOU'D WAKE UP. I AM AWAKE, GINNY, WIDE AWAKE. THIS IS WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE. HEY, MOM, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT TAKING CHINESE FOOD OUT TONIGHT? SWEETIE, YOUR DAD AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING. WE'RE GONNA TRY TO WORK IT OUT. LOOK... I PROMISE YOU IT'S GONNA BE OKAY. NO, I-I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU'RE TAKING HIM BACK. YOU ARE? YEAH. AND HE PROMISED ME THAT HE WOULDN'T HURT YOU AGAIN. OKAY. YEAH. GO ORDER. YEAH. I AM NOT A VICTIM. MAYBE IT LOOKS LIKE I AM. I KNOW PEOPLE IN TOWN MIGHT THINK SO IF THEY KNEW WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THIS HOUSE. BUT DEEP INSIDE ME, I KNOW I'M NOT. GEORGE DOESN'T BEAT ME BECAUSE HE WANTS TO HURT ME. HE DOES IT 'CAUSE HE'S AFRAID TO LOSE ME. WOW. THE THING ABOUT GEORGE IS, I UNDERSTAND HIM. WE ALL NEED TO BE UNDERSTOOD. I'LL NEVER LET YOU GO AGAIN. HELLO? Stephen? Aaron Lance. OH, HEY, AARON. THANKS SO MUCH FOR CALLING ME BACK. LISTEN... YOU REMEMBER YOU TOLD ME IF I EVER NEEDED A LAWYER TO GIVE YOU A CALL? I'm at your service, pastor. What's up? YEAH, WELL... I'M CALLING YOU. I'M GONNA BE LEAVING TOWN FOR A WHILE. HELLO, JIM. HELLO, AARON. AND HERE'S HAVERILL'S FAVORITE SPITFIRE. HELLO. WHERE'S YOUR CLIENT? OH, HE'S NOT COMING BACK UNTIL HE'S ASSURED HE WON'T BE ARRESTED. WELL, THEN, WE'LL JUST FIND HIM. CATHERINE, WE ALL KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO GET EVEN AN INDICTMENT. THIS ONLY GOES FORWARD IF HE CONFESSES, AND HE'S NOT GONNA CONFESS TO A CRIME HE DID NOT COMMIT. NOW, I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS CASE, AND I COMMEND YOU FOR IT. YOU'RE JUST WRONG. WELL, WE'LL SEE. IT'S ALWAYS VERY NICE TO SEE YOU. MM-HMM. OH. OOH. LULA, NO. HEY. HEY. OH, KATIE, HI. I'M REALLY SORRY TO JUST STOP BY LIKE THIS, BUT I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP. IT'S ABOUT PASTOR DREW, ISN'T IT? YES. LISTEN, UM... COULD YOU JUST COME OUTSIDE? CAN WE... CAN WE TALK? YEAH. YEAH, SURE. I MEAN, I'M NOT SURPRISED. I KNOW YOU GUYS SEARCHED HIS HOUSE AND EVERYTHING, BUT... PASTOR DREW? REALLY? ANYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF, KATIE, ANYTHING AT ALL. ALL I CAN THINK OF IS HOW MUCH SHE LIKED HIM. I MEAN, SHE... REALLY LIKED HIM. YOU KNEW ABOUT THE AFFAIR? SHE TRIED TO HIDE IT, BUT, I MEAN, I FIGURED IT OUT. IS THAT WHY YOU GUYS THINK IT'S HIM? WELL, IT CERTAINLY GIVES HIM MOTIVE, YES. I HAD THIS, UH, DREAM A COUPLE OF NIGHTS AGO. AND, UM, MY PARENTS WERE DEAD. AND THEN LULA WAS LAPPING THE BLOOD OFF MY DAD'S HEAD. AND IT WAS REALLY DISGUSTING AND IT FELT REALLY REAL AND THEN WHEN I WOKE UP, IT JUST... I GOT SICK AND... KATIE, LISTEN. WHEN THE POLICE GOT HERE, LULA WAS OUTSIDE, OKAY? SO, EVEN IF THAT SEEMED REAL IN YOUR DREAM... MM-HMM. ...IT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE, OKAY? WAIT. OKAY. LULA'S NEVER OUTSIDE UNLESS SHE'S ON A LEASH. SO, WHOEVER SHOT YOUR DAD MUST HAVE LET HER OUT. SHE WOULD HAVE ATTACKED SOMEBODY THAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW, ESPECIALLY AT THE HOUSE. SHE DOESN'T LIKE STRANGERS, AND SHE HATES MEN, EXCEPT FOR DAD AND PASTOR DREW. SO, YOU'RE SAYING SHE WOULD HAVE ATTACKED A STRANGER. YEAH, SHREDDED THEM. MY PARENTS ALMOST GOT SUED ONCE. BUT THE ONLY BLOOD IN THE HOUSE BELONGED TO YOUR PARENTS. KATIE... LULA MUST HAVE KNOWN YOUR FATHER'S KILLER. SHE MUST HAVE. OH. DON'T LET IT, LIKE, BE HIM 'C... I'm so sorry. PLEASE DON'T LET IT BE HIM. YOU MADE IT. YEAH. THANKS FOR THE INVITE. THANKS FOR COMING. I'LL TAKE THAT. SURE. SO, COME ON BACK. THIS PLACE IS AWFUL. I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE A SHACK. IS IT HAUNTED? IT'S MY REFUGE. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU. REALLY BEAUTIFUL. OH, I READ YOUR BOOK. UH-HUH? AND I LIKED IT. BUT...? WELL, YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT ILLUMINATION AND CHERUBS AND SERAPHIM AND FLYING MONKEYS. IS THAT REALLY ALL YOU GOT FROM MY BOOK? YOU KNOW, I TALK ABOUT GRIEF AND CLOSURE, TOO. YEAH, I KNOW. I LIKED THAT PART. BUT YOU CAME. SO YOU DON'T THINK I'M A COMPLETE PHONY. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE A COMPLETE PHONY. WHO AM I TO TALK? I DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWERS. I SPEND MY DAYS COUNSELING PEOPLE, AND I CAN BARELY MANAGE MY OWN LIFE. MM. YEP. LET'S GO FOR A WALK. I'M GLAD YOU CAME. I'M GLAD I CAME, TOO. ALICE. YOU JUST CALLED ME ALICE. DON'T. I'M SORRY. DID YOU LOVE HER? I DID. I DID LOVE HER. AND YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD SAVE HER. I THOUGHT SHE WAS SAVING HERSELF WHEN SHE LEFT GEORGE. I JUST... I COULDN'T HANDLE THAT. I... I DON'T KNOW. ALICE WAS PART OF THE CONGREGATION. SHE WAS IN THIS ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. SEEING THOSE SCARS... THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT... I BROKE IT OFF, SHE WENT BACK TO GEORGE, AND HE KILLED HER. THE TRUTH IS, I GUESS, I DIDN'T REALLY REALIZE THAT I TRULY LOVED HER UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE. BEING IN THAT HOUSE, ALL THE BLOOD, LIFE DRAINED FROM HER BODY, ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS KATIE AND HOW HER LIFE AS SHE KNEW IT WAS OVER. I HAD TO HELP HER. EVEN IF MEANS GOING TO JAIL, I... I'M SORRY. I SHOULD GO. NO. STAY. IS THAT ALL RIGHT? YEAH, OF COURSE. IT'S ALMOST MORNING. WE'LL TALK MORE THEN. THANK YOU. MY BAG IN THE CAR. MRS. BENINCASA? AH. GOOD MORNING, PASTOR. WE NEED TO TALK. EMMET. GENTLEMEN. STEPHEN DREW, YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR THE MURDER OF GEORGE HAYWARD. STEPHEN, WILL YOU BAPTIZE ME? DID YOU HEAR ME? SORRY. YES. ALICE, I THINK ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME. DON'T. THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU AND ME. IT'S ABOUT A RECOMMITMENT TO MY FAITH. WHAT ABOUT GEORGE? WHAT WILL HE THINK? I DON'T GIVE A DAMN WHAT GEORGE THINKS. SO, YOU'LL TELL HIM? IF HE ASKS. YOU THINK THAT'S SMART? I'M THE MASTER OF MY OWN DESTINY, STEPHEN... NOT YOU AND NOT GEORGE. SO, WILL YOU BAPTIZE ME? YES, ALICE, I'LL BAPTIZE YOU. CAN I HELP YOU? YEAH, YOU CAN STAY AWAY FROM MY WIFE. HOW ABOUT THAT? OH, THERE'S SO MANY THINGS I'D LIKE TO SAY TO YOU RIGHT NOW. YEAH? SO, WHAT'S STOPPING YOU? RESPECT FOR YOUR WIFE. I SAW YOU TALKING TO HER TODAY IN TOWN. I FOLLOWED HER. YOUR COWARDICE ASTONISHES ME. THE MORE INVOLVED SHE'S GOTTEN WITH YOU AND YOUR CHURCH, THE MORE DISRESPECTFUL SHE'S GOTTEN AT HOME. CHERISH WHAT YOU HAVE. YOU PUT ANY MORE IDEAS INTO MY WIFE'S HEAD, AND I SWEAR TO GOD I WILL KILL YOU. HOW YOU DOING THESE DAYS? I ACTUALLY FEEL PRETTY GUILTY MOST OF THE TIME. HOW COME? SO, I JUST KEEP THINKING THAT IF I DIDN'T GO TO THAT CONCERT AND IF I DIDN'T LEAVE HER ALONE... THEN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE FOUGHT? AND YOUR MOTHER WOULD STILL BE ALIVE? BUT THEY'D BOTH BE ALIVE, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, I COULDN'T BE THERE ALL THE TIME. AND THEY'D ACTUALLY STOPPED FIGHTING, SO I FIGURED JUST ONE NIGHT OUT WITH MY FRIENDS WAS... OF COURSE YOU DID, KATIE. YOU'RE A KID. YOU DESERVE THAT. KATIE, IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT. IT WASN'T. MRS. BENINCASA, YOU THINK THAT PASTOR DREW SHOT MY DAD, DON'T YOU? I'M SURE HE DID. IT'S RIGHT AROUND HERE. LET ME CHECK WITH THE OFFICE AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE LETTING HIM GO. YOU'VE GOT NO CONFESSION, AND HE'S MADE BOND. WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO LET HIM GO. WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO CONVICT HIM FOR MURDER WITH WHAT WE HAVE. I'M SORRY, CATHERINE. SO, WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA PRESS CHARGES NOW? IS THAT PART OF YOUR NEW ATTITUDE? I SHOULD. YOU GOT BAPTIZED TO SPITE ME? OH, GOD, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU? THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU. IT WAS ABOUT ME, GEORGE, ME! YOU DID IT TO PLEASE HIM, AND YOU DID IT TO MOCK ME. WELL, GUESS WHAT. A MAN LIKE THAT DOESN'T WANT A WHORE LIKE YOU! YES, HE DID! HE WANTED ME! AND HE HAD ME IN THIS HOUSE, IN THIS KITCHEN, IN THE BEDROOM! AND GUESS WHAT! I LIKED IT! AH! WHORE! SHUT UP! HELLO, PASTOR. YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE, CATHERINE. DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME TO LET IT GO? NO, BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER. BUT I WON'T GIVE UP ON KATIE LIKE YOU DID ON ALICE. I'LL BE WATCHING YOU. WITH SUMMER ALMOST OVER, LIFE SEEMS TO BE RETURNING TO NORMAL. THE CASE IS COLD, AND NO OTHER SUSPECTS WERE EVER NAMED. I DON'T SEE MUCH OF CATHERINE BENINCASA THESE DAYS. NOT SURPRISINGLY, SHE NO LONGER ATTENDS MY CHURCH. I STILL THINK OF ALICE EVERY DAY. I NOW KNOW THAT WHAT I DID WAS PART OF GOD'S PLAN. MANY OF MY CONGREGANTS HAVE STRUGGLED TO PUT THE EVENTS OF THE PAST MONTHS BEHIND THEM, BUT WE'RE BEGINNING TO FIND OUR WAY AGAIN. HEALING HAS A FUNNY WAY OF FINDING ITS WAY THROUGH DARKNESS. KATIE HAS A LOT OF GRIEVING TO DO, BUT LIVING AT GINNY'S HAS DONE HER SOME GOOD. FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, SHE KNOWS I'LL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR HER. HEY, PASTOR DREW. THANKS AGAIN FOR EVERYTHING. PROMISE ME YOU'LL LET US KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU NEED. NO, I WILL. I PROMISE. OKAY. GIVE ME THIS. THANKS. I AM GONNA MISS YOU SO MUCH. I'M GONNA MISS YOU, TOO. DRIVE SAFE. I'M GONNA MISS YOU THE MOST. YEAH. THANKS FOR DRIVING ME. YOU KIDDING ME? IT'S MY HONOR. YOU MUST BE EXCITED... COLBY. YEAH. MMM. BYE. GUYS? MOM? DAD? THE HAYWARDS... THEY APPEARED TO HAVE IT ALL... MOM? ...BLESSED WITH GOOD HEALTH... MOM? MOM?! MOM?! MO... MO... ...AND A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER, KATIE... DAD? DAD? DAD, IT'S... DA... ...EVERY PARENT'S DREAM, KIND-HEARTED, RESPONSIBLE, AND SMART. GEORGE OWNED A SUCCESSFUL CHAIN OF SPORTING-GOOD STORES ACROSS THE STATE... EVERY WOMAN'S DREAM. ALICE WAS A HOMEMAKER, AND SHE WAS ACTIVE IN CHURCH. THE ALL-AMERICAN FAMILY. BUT THAT'S THE TROUBLE OF BEING ON THE OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN... YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW. I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO. I COULDN'T GO BACK TO TINA'S. YOU'RE SAFE HERE. YOU'RE SAFE HERE. YOU CAN TRUST ME. PUT YOUR HANDS UNDER THERE. SO, ARE WE... ARE WE SUPPOSED TO CALL THE POLICE? NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. WE'RE NOT GONNA CALL THE POLICE. YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO TO JAIL. I WON'T LET YOU RUIN THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. I'LL MAKE IT LOOK LIKE YOUR FATHER SHOT HIMSELF. YEAH, BUT WHAT IF THEY FIND OUT THAT HE DIDN'T? IF THEY SUSPECT ANYONE, WE'LL LET THEM SUSPECT ME. THEN YOU'LL GO TO JAIL, RIGHT? I KNOW. ALL RIGHT, NOW, WHAT ABOUT TINA? DOES SHE KNOW YOU'RE GONE? NO, SHE WAS ASLEEP WHEN I LEFT. I JUST WANTED TO GET MY COMPUTER. ALL RIGHT, THEN YOU NEED TO GET BACK TO TINA'S, AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS. YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME? I WOULD. AND I WILL. THE POLICE ARE STARTING TO SUSPECT ME, WHICH IS A GOOD THING. SO, IF THEY QUESTION YOU, INCRIMINATE ME. YEAH, BUT THEN YOU'RE GONNA GET ARRESTED. THEN YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL, AND I DON'T WANT THAT. THIS WHOLE THING'S MY FAULT, ANYWAY. THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO CONVICT ME, BUT I WANT THEM TO THINK THAT I DID IT. LISTEN... THE ONLY WAY THAT YOUR MOM WON'T DIE IN VAIN IS IF YOU LIVE A HAPPY LIFE. I WANT TO GIVE YOU THAT CHANCE. YEAH, BUT... JUST DO WHAT I TELL YOU. THANKS AGAIN FOR EVERYTHING, PASTOR DREW. I'D DO IT AGAIN IN A HEARTBEAT. IF I LIVE TO BE OLD, I KNOW I'LL HAVE A TON OF REGRETS, BUT PUTTING A BULLET IN MY DAD'S HEAD WON'T EVER BE ONE OF THEM.
