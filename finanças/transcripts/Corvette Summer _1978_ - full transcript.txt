Look at the fins. You like it? I love it. Yeah. No way. O.K., keep your eyes peeled for a Packard. You guys want to do a Camaro? Whoa. Don't get me wrong. I got nothing against Ford products. Climb under and tell me if that cross member's straight. Come on. Cut that out. Yeah, it's straight, but there's no Springs. No! No! Wait! Dantley, where you going? Can't you see? It's a Corvette!

Don't you remember? There's one in the mailbox. Uh-oh. I guess I took it. I left my key ring at the lounge. It's late, isn't it? What time is it? Late. Who you out with tonight? Oh... That's Mr. Borodino. He's in real estate. Why? I don't know. Thought I heard his water pump going. He ought to look at that. Got the key? Have fun tonight? Did you have a date? Not really. Say... Aren't you going to give me a kiss, huh? Come on. Give your old mother a kiss. I haven't seen you all day. Hi, Bernie. Naw, it's not late. Come on over. Dave? It's Ed McGrath. Yes, I am passing the hat again, only this time, I was wondering if you folks could contribute a set of bf GTAs. Yeah, I know, but it's for a good cause...

Be proud of it. Yeah, you're right. It is perfect. Listen, Dantley... Don't you go bad on me. I don't want to read in the paper you're sticking up filling stations to support your car habit. You're a good kid, talented kid... But I wish you'd done better in your classes. What's the difference? I'm out, aren't I? O.K., comedian. You joke about it. But I had high hopes. Better attitude, better grades... Couple of years in junior college, I'd have seen one of my boys in the art center. Come on. Don't you get on me. I had a good year. Here. To general motors. Wine? Scotch. Listen, Dantley... Kenny... I been around automobiles all my life. They're mechanical devices. They always let you down. You buy them, drive them, break them, fix them... You sell them. Goods in the marketplace. Easy come, easy go. Don't get too attached to this car. You don't fool me, Mr. McGrath. You might have seen a lot of cars... But you love this one just as much as I do.

Uh, Roger, uh, Wilco. 10-4. Over and out. And, Kootz, take the keys. Did you copy, Kootz? Come in, Corvette. Come in. Rotten kid. Where the hell is that little bastard, anyway? I bet he slopped the drinks on the seat and he's too scared to face us. Come in, Kootz. Come in, Kootz. Stingray, do you read me? There he is! No, that's not him. Oh, yes, it is. You said to get cokes. They're right here. The keys are in my pocket. I was only in there a minute. They never started it. I would have heard. They must've towed it. Are you towing cars tonight? No, and this is legal parking. Did you leave it running? Of course I didn't. The keys are right here. You said get cokes. I didn't want no cokes. Who said I was thirsty? I want my car. Kootz... You little shit, you lost it! Dantley, don't we have enough trouble here? Don't worry, son. We'll get your car back. Unfortunately, your car was a Corvette. They are the favorite target of your professional car ring... Corvette, Porsche, '67 Impala, Buick Riviera, Dune buggies... and now they're getting into your RVS. What about your Toronado? Oh, that's right, sir. Your principal's car was taken two years ago, and it was never recovered. Frankly, we feel there's a ring working right in this area. No matter what you've heard in math class, some things are worth more than the sum of their parts. Stingray front clip... we're talking about $750 right there. No, I'm sorry to say so, but that's it for your machine. It's out of state, and it's in pieces. I understand you have insurance. That's it? It's a kiss-off, after all the work we did? You ought to be out looking. Sit down, Dantley. Look, I know how you feel. Might as well resign yourselves. You'll never see that car again. No one's going to break that car up. I don't buy that "sum of the parts" crap. You guys have seen... it's the best-looking street machine on the west coast. No one's going to lay a finger on it. Fill 'er up? Nope. Gonna fill you up. Promise 'em anything... But give 'em Arpege. Oh. Here you go. Yeah. Yeah. Beg your pardon? I sure as hell have. Have what? Kid... This car is in Las Vegas. What are you talking about? You've seen it? Sure, I saw it. It was in one of those big casinos on a mirror going round. It's on display. Where? Yeah... Where? Hell, I can't remember. I was with a client on the strip. Wait, wait. This was a Corvette, right? Candy-apple? Candy-apple metal flake. Superior mags, Mercury tubes, Gabriel shocks? Kid, this is the car you're looking for, right? Yeah. This is the car I saw. Hey, where you going, Las Vegas? Yeah. Far out. We take you the whole way. Jump in. Wow... What's this supposed to be, anyway, a hearse? You don't like cars? Sure, I like cars. I... I love 'em. Yeah, you like cars. What kind of ride you like, charger, Camaro? Nah. Corvette, huh? Yeah. You got it. Sure, I got it. Corvette, Anglo. Anglo, Corvette. What's wrong with a Corvette? It's all gm. What's gm have to do with it? Excuse me, uh... 17 miles an hour? 15. On the interstate? You looking for a contact lens? Ha. You paddies crack me up. Still doing your speed, huh? What are you into, miles per gallon? Class. We're into class. O.K. I got to get out now. No. We're going to Los Huevos, remember? Friend, just let me out. You don't even have to stop.

You go to MacArthur High? Yeah. I just graduated. No kidding. I go to San Fernando. Huh. What are you going to Vegas for? I'm looking for my car. Somebody stole my stingray. Word's out it's in Vegas. You've got a Corvette? Oh, sure. Nice Van you got here. Yeah, really, but you can't tell from up front. Go on back and, uh, check it out. Nice. Who did the work? Some friends of mine... You know, in exchange for services rendered. Services? What kind of services? You know what I mean. Hey, bring up a couple cold ones. We'll talk about it. So... What are you going to Vegas for, a summer job? Uh-uh. Full-time, sugar, from now on. Hey, how old are you? You know what I'm talking about. You've met girls like me. I guess. I'm a hooker, for Christ's sake. A what? What, you mean like a prostitute? Well, you know, like a trainee, anyway. I mean, there comes a time when every amateur goes pro. Take it! What are you doing? I got to get ready. I'm pulling over. Ho-ly smoke. Hi. Yeah. Hi. Tell you what. You can be my first customer. Oh... Boy, you got to be kidding. No. No, I'm not. What do you think I'm worth? Oh, I...

Did you just say 15 or 50? 50! Oh, I said 50. That's what I said. 50. That's more like it. You got yourself a deal. Let's jump in the back. I wasn't making a bid. I know. I know. You never paid for it before in your life. But then again... You never had me. Look, this is my stop. Really nice riding with you, but will you hand me my gear, please? Don't be like that. O.K. Come on. Here's the thing. I didn't want to... give me my gear! My final offer. $20. Maybe some other time. Hey, wait. What's your name, anyway? You can read, can't you? "Van... essa." Excuse me, uh, sir? Yes, sir? A room? A name, please? N-no. No room. I'm looking for a car. The garage is one floor down. Elevator to your right. No. No, wait. See, you got a car in the lobby on a mirror? We sure don't, sir. Yes, sir? Thank you. Excuse me. Please, sir, it's a stingray, a '73. Yes, I heard. A car on a mirror. That's one thing we don't have. Excuse me. Excuse me. You look like a winner. You really do. I got something I'd like you to see. Just something right here. Huh? Come here. My friend and I, we're a little short on cash. You got 70 bucks on you? Hey, most of these are real diamonds. Well, I... hey, 100 bucks. You gonna say no to a Bulova? I'm from out of town. I don't want anything. All right, I gotcha. We'll catch you later, champ. Excuse me, sir? Yes, sir. I know this sounds crazy, but you don't have a car in there, do you? Inside to your left, near the lounge. I'm talking about a full-sized automobile. Call it what you want. It's just a goddamn Hotrod. A Datsun? It's a Datsun! Yeah, I know. You'd think they'd at least have a Cadillac. I was told it was a Corvette. Don't take it so hard. Why don't we try someplace else? $4.80. Good god. My wallet's gone. "Most of them are real diamonds." What'd you have in mind, double or nothing? I got to eat. Let me wash dishes for it. It's all paper. Beat it! Give the kid his food! Are you good for it? I'm not only good for it, I'll make it interesting. How about 4 to 1? How about 10 to 1? Huh? Huh? Heads. I love it! Go ahead, kid. What's the catch? There's no catch. Boy, are you dirty. Hey, just call me Gladstone duck. It is the damnedest thing. I cannot lose for trying. I been in this town 18 hours. I made $18,000. I've heard of it happening to other guys, but to think it could happen to me... Makes you believe in the almighty. Well, it's time for me to go, and I know it. Let me give you some advice, kid. Quit while you're ahead. Get out of Vegas. You're not going to Los Angeles, by any chance. No. I'm going to run this baby back to Avis and catch the first plane to Portland. O.K. See ya. Hey, kid. You're in a bad way. I tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to pass my lucky streak on to you. Here. A $2.00 bill? That's what I started with. Morning. Climb in. Hi. Hey, hey! Wait! Hey! Stop! Wait! Hey. That's quite a car. We shouldn't have any trouble picking it up. You got a license number? No problem. One-of-a-kind. Totally unique. I'm sure it is to your eyes, but there's a lot of fancy cars here. Are you positive you weren't running after somebody else's automobile? No way. Look. See what I did with the steering wheel? Yeah, what about it? It's right-hand drive. Ha! So it is. What do you know? Maybe you can let me ride with a patrolman. I could really help spot it. The Las Vegas police department is one of the finest in the country. We can handle it. Dear Mr. McGrath, I've tracked the Corvette to Las Vegas, Nevada. It's here. I saw it. Someone probably won it in a card game. Bet you 4 to 1 I find it. Get it? Don't worry about me. I won't gamble. I don't have the money for it. Goodbye for now. Sincerely, Kenny Dantley. P.S. Lots of incredible cars here. Shit. Goddamn it. Hi. Jesus Christ. Sorry I scared you. Do you remember me? Oh, yeah. Love your shawl. The men's room's open. Do I look like a man? Who's gonna bother you? What are you doing here, anyway? I got a place nearby. Rent's right. Oh, you're sleeping in a u-haul, huh? Forget it. Get in my Van and make yourself comfortable. I'm all right where I am. How you doing? Life on the street kind of rough, huh? I seen rougher. I just got started on the wrong foot, that's all. Blue jeans. Kiss of death. You ever seen those $100 models work the hotels? See the way they dress, how they look? You look cheap, you are cheap, and it's all downhill from there. No, I gotta get me an outfit. You know? Something sophisticated. Black velvet with a little choker ribbon. So what are you doing out here freezing to death? Hmm? Get in the Van. There's food in the fridge. How do you like that ocean motion? Oh, it's great. Really great. You know, uh, I hear some people keep fish in them. You got a girlfriend? No. No. Well, no one special. You ever go out? Yeah, sure. Anybody ever tell you you're cute? Well, you are. Hey... You know what I got on under here? Paper towels? Nothin'. My streaker suit. If you're going to spend the night, you're going to spend it with me. Comprende, amigo? Oh, uh, sure. You know, I-I'm cool. So... peel off them duds, sailor, and let me see what you got. Fine. Fine. Do, uh, do you mind if I close the curtains? Go ahead. O.K. Got it. There's one. Here. Take my towel, would you, and hang it on something. O.K. Yeah. Are you O.K.? Oh, yeah. I just... Got a little knot in one of my shoelaces. Just do a little... Wait a minute. This is a real honor. What do you mean? I'm going to be your first woman. Oh, no. No, no. Hey, I've been through this a lot. A whole lot. No, you haven't. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Come here. Mama help. I know just how you feel. As a matter of fact, there are a lot of moves that I haven't tried yet. Moves? Yeah. Maneuvers... Which are going to be very important in my line of work. You don't mind, do you? Hey. Where are you going? Oh, nowhere. I just thought things might work out better if I slept over here. This sure is warmer than that old u-haul. Are you putting me on? Oh, no. No, no, no. It's just... I got to get some sleep. I'm really out on my feet. Hey, come on. What are you doing? Nothing. Where's your wallet, anyway? Let go of that, and stay out of my pockets! Look, we got to have some rules around here. You spend the night, you get charged! I never laid a hand on you! I don't care! You've got a lot of nerve. What are you so mad at? You had your chance. That'll be 20 bucks! Stop the hooker stuff! Cough it up! You spent the whole night! It ought to be 40! No way! I didn't do anything! You stink! Boy, do I need a pimp! Everything I got I give to you! Full payment for services rendered! Oh! I hate you! Oh, yeah? That's telling her, kid. What do you want? This is my gas station. I like your style. You ever pumped gas? Quiet down. It's me. I was just going over my mail. I got a postcard here from Kenny Dantley. He's in Las Vegas. That's the idea. Looks just like a new one, don't it? You know something, kid? You catch on fast. As of today, I am promoting you to salesman. I have just seen your first needy motorist. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Take these... And drop them in her battery. What? Alka seltzer. Yeah. Plop plop. Fizz fizz? Can you handle it? Yeah. Sure. Fill her up? Yes, please. And may I check under your hood, ma'am? And, uh, what, shall I look under your hood? Yeah. O.K. Uh-oh. What have we here? Foam. Battery problems. Are you traveling far? Across the desert. Well, fortunately for you, we have a special sale on new batteries. Say, Gil, I was wondering... you're doing great, kid. Now, listen. I want you to cut her fan belt. This is my magic ring. Just a flick, a snip. Just a Nick, that's all. Here. Take this battery. She doesn't have any cash. She lost it all playing Blackjack. That's what they all say! She can't pay for the gas. Her credit card's expired. Hey! Stop! Stop! Crook! Maybe we could mail her the bill. Hello, cheapskate. Hi. Looks like I lost a quart of Quaker State, two sets of wiper blades... I got some hot news. Get in. Where's my STP? They even took my credit card machine! And my anteater. Dantley, you're in trouble! I'm working now. I'll see you. The job can wait. It's important. Get in. Can I maybe... Oh, no, you don't, Dantley. You're working overtime because this is all your fault. Don't listen to him. He can take a ride if he wants to. Are you running a prison farm? Vámonos. So, what's the hot news? You're unemployed. Very funny. What are you supposed to be now, a nurse? A beautician. I got a job in a hotel beauty shop. Did you notice I frosted my tips? It's neat, huh? Wonderful. Is that what you came to tell me? I lost a job because you frosted your tips? Take it easy. What about the hooker number? What happened to that? Nothing. This just gives me a chance to get my act together. Hey, can I tell you something? You're never going to be a prostitute. You haven't got it in you. You're right. You're right. As a matter of fact, there are no prostitutes in Las Vegas. Look at this. "Good company escorts..." oh, god. What do you think of the name Rosalind? Rosalind? What's wrong with Vanessa? First of all, it's not my name. My real name's Eleanor. Eleanor? Second of all, I'm not sure that Vanessa's got the right tone to it. It might be a mistake for me. Rosalind. Oh, no! Hey! That's my car! How about a lift? Come on in. There he is. Tromp it! What the... are you out of your mind? Kenny, it's a red light! Go through it. That's my car! I can't move! It's illegal! What do you call auto theft? Sit down and shut up. Don't be such a... Oh, god. God, we're losing him! Ow! Kenny, c-o-p, c-o-p. Oh, perfect! That's a stolen car! What's the problem here? You, uh, take the wrong pill this morning? This is what I'm talking about. We still got a good chance. This Dodge has the performance package, right? Are you kidding me? It's not even his car. It belongs to the school. What a nut! It's not even your car! So what? I built it. Can we discuss this after we catch him? Slow down, friend. Radio... even faster than rubber. You did get the license number, right? License number? Right. It was, uh... It was, uh... Oh, god. Nevada. P-r-b-2-3. Thank you, miss. On your vehicle I.D. Check, stolen Nevada p-r-b-2-3, we show no such Nevada registration. Repeat. No such Nevada registration. It's a forgery. They forged it. Dear Mr. McGrath, I saw the car again, but it eluded my grasp. I know the world is full of crooks, but jail is too good for the guy who's driving it. Well, at least he's kept it waxed. Would you believe it? I met a girl with this Van. I think she likes me. Well, that's all for now. Sincerely... Kenny? What are you writing? P.S. The spoiler still looks kind of high to me. What is that? A letter to mommy? No. It's to a friend of mine, one of my teachers. Teachers... they're worse than parents. I hate them all. There's teachers and there's teachers. This one's different. He helped me with the car. Oh, the car. The car, the car. I should've guessed. Hey, hey, I got a terrific idea. Why don't you write a letter to the car? Dear car... I miss you so much. What are you doing? Mixing screwdrivers. Want some? No, thanks. Come on. Vitamin C. Not for me. Well, I got to do this. I'm in training. If a girl can't hold her liquor, falls asleep with her trick, and then where is she? Asleep on her trick. Is that a fact? What do you drink... Motor oil?

The trouble is, you don't know what a Corvette is. Hand me a washcloth, would you? It's not... oh... an ordinary car. It's a... I mean... Families don't buy them to go... go... go to the supermarket in. Corvette's a man's car. I mean... Uh, a woman might buy one, but that's only to get noticed in. A man drives a Corvette because that's what it is... it's a Corvette. Where are my pajamas, huh? Will you give them to me? It's fast and powerful. It handles. It's beautiful. It's the only sports car made in America and happens to be very... Important to me. I know. It's a terrific car. What's that? It was a kiss. I... I was kissing you. What do you want to kiss for? Let's screw. Yeah, sure. You didn't say a word about my souvenir. You gave it to me. My first cash sale. Some souvenir. Come on, Kenny. You want to kiss? I can kiss.

Just a minute. Come here, let me get your front. And don't look so goddamn depressed. You got them. And you found your car. You're a big winner, you lucky son of a bitch. Kenny. Kenny, you did it... All by yourself. Hey! Over here! Ha ha ha! Mr. McGrath! Far out! Kenny, how you doing? Fantastic. Terri... I've been looking for you. Great. Just in time. I found the car. I knew you would. I want to talk to you about that. You should see these guys. You talk about bad news... mean, stupid, vicious bastards. I think they were getting ready to kill me. I know they were. They got some kind of operation going. They work out of a body shop. I know... Silverado auto body. Y-yeah. Oh, you've been doing a little spade work, too. Oh, aren't we something? We got 'em. I even know the name of the guy that runs the show. You do? Name's Wayne Lowry... talented body man, designer, good business head, very aggressive. Yeah? He's a former student of mine, class of '71. No shit. Kenny... You've been to my house, huh? You met Marsha. You know what I got... pool, orange trees, a couple of great kids, huh? Yeah. You know how much I make a year? It must be kind of rough, huh? $13,000. 13,000 lousy dollars. Mr. McGrath, don't you think we ought to go to the police right away? I mean, you know, if we give 'em too much time, they could get away. This truck... Paying monthly for it. The mortgage payments on the house, they were killing me. They upped the taxes 100%. I'm just a little guy, Kenny, a teacher, and I'm getting killed. Everyone has to answer the question... am I a sucker or what? We all play the game, but who makes up the rules? Oh, Mr. McGrath. One day a fellow comes to me with a proposition, a former student of mine doing very well for himself. You mean... You stole the Corvette? Oh, Jesus Christ. Jesus. I'm sorry. You got to see that car for what it is. It's a commodity to be bought and sold just like everything on this earth. So you go to the police. You know what happens? I go to jail. My wife loses the house... Probably her mind. Kids are disgraced. Is that what you want to do to my family? We're talking about a victimless crime here. Who got hurt? The insurance company pays off. What the hell? They can afford it. So you go to the police? No. You got a good head on your shoulders and a hell of a touch. There's no reason we can't put you to work. I'm not talking about pumping gas. I'm talking about $700 a week, and you get to do what you were born to do. How many people get that chance? How come you never said anything? We laid up all that fiberglass together. You never sa... how was I to know you'd fall in love with a pile of junk? Are you worried about living in Las Vegas? No. You worried about your mother? No. Good, because Mom has gone to Del Mar. Del mar? Yeah. She's got a boyfriend. Look, Kenny, I'm offering you a job. Tell me, please, you'll take it. I don't know. You got to know! You got to know right now! Why are you doing this? You don't owe me anything. Look behind me. I don't like him any more than you do, but if I don't hit my lights here in just about a minute, he'll come over here and handle it his way. He calls the shots, Kenny. I don't. Come on. Say yes, huh? Come on. Come on. Please. Was a hell of a car. We should've lowered the spoiler, huh? It's 9:30. He's coming. He's coming. He'll be here. I'm not worried. I'm just saying it's 9:30, and you been had. Something tells me this little Turkey is smarter than you thought he was. Keep your shirt on. I see him. Morning, Kenny. How you feeling? Fine. I want you to meet the man you're gonna work for. Wayne Lowry. Hey, Jeff, Tony. Get over here. Meet a guy who knows about cars. Alright. Listen, I'm really sorry about that chain. I'm sorry about that. Hello, again. No hard feelings, right? We're starting from scratch, right? Wrong. That 700 a week? Not enough. 850. Now, wait a minute. First week in advance. There you go. I see what you're doing. I'd do the same thing. Make 'em pay you what you're worth, right? Come on. Gee, Mr. Sinatra, I didn't know you were in town. I could go for you in a big way. That one. What are you trying to pull? Oh, I love it. Kenny... Did you sell your car? No, no. That wasn't your car to sell. That belonged to the high school. I never sold it. So, uh... Where did all this money come from, Mr. Dantley? You didn't pay for this with a $2.00 bill. I got a job. Pays 850 a week. 850 a week? We do custom work. Special cars for special people. Oh, I get it. You're going to make it an inside job. Steal your own car back. You think you can pull it off? What are you talking about? 850 a week. That's what I'm pulling off. Well, what about your car? You've got to see it for what it is. It's a commodity to be bought and sold like anything else on this earth. Don't laugh. I'm not telling you anything new. Thing is... I can have any car I want now... A Corvette... A Cadillac... A Lamborghini. Lamborghini. What's the matter? Oh, it's... it's great, I guess. Um... Wait a minute. I got something that'll cheer you up. I'm a paying customer. Oh, Jesus. What am I doing? You're worth a lot more than 20 bucks. Here's another 50. And you're worth a lot more than that. You keep your money. This one's on the house. O.K. Hold it right there. Hi there. Looking for some paint for my wheels. Sorry, man. We don't do vans. I just want to get rid of this. I want it to say "Pete's pulsator." Really classy. Try Orlando's down the street. Hey, where'd you get this? It's my new Van. I just bought it. Bullshit. You're a car thief. Look at that back window and tell me how much bullshit you want to eat. Got it from Alslip's this morning. Had a waterbed in the back. Wasn't nothing but a boff buggy. Orlando's your man. Thank you. What's so goddamn funny? You, man, calling that guy a car thief. Jesus. Vanessa? Who? Come on, already. Will you talk to me? Sorry, pal. She missed two days' work, and she owes me for some meals. Hey, stay right there! Is that you? I beg your pardon? I mean, wow! No wonder you're not slingin' hamburgers anymore. Have we met? I don't believe I know you. What? Here you go, Rosalind. Play with these. Oh, Mr. Blanchard, I'm losing all your money. How about another drink? Rosalind? Oh, that's the Rosalind crap again. Where did you get that dress? Would you shut up? If you think... just because... let's take a walk. Great, great, great. Just terrific. You finally went and did it. A hooker. The real thing. Where do you get off? I'm getting 100 bucks a shot, and you know what I'm doing? Body work... just like you. Rosalind, where'd you go? Oh, coming. Creep. $100. $100. I'll give you $200. 1,000. You don't have to do this. Come on, Kenny. It's not your money I'm after. Here you go, gin-gin. Who's your friend? Oh, this is just my cousin homer. Goodbye, homer. Call me tomorrow. Say, you wouldn't want to get in on the action. I got some friends coming by. Its gonna be a hell of a party. I'd make it worth your while. Hey, enough is enough. Beer time. O.K. Hey, don't forget to turn off the lights and lock up. What is that? Wow. What the hell happened? Look out! Oh, you son of a... Ow! That's it. Yeah! Give him to me, baby. Come on, now. Come on, baby. This time I got you. Ha! Yeah. Now! Ow! Sir, the keys? I'll get it. Hello, old buddy. I'm glad you made it. Take it easy, pal. I don't want any trouble. I've got expensive equipment here. Kenny Dantley, get your ass out of here! I'm going to call the cops. Oh, no! Don't do that. You in the tub... You're checking out. I'm not coming! Who do you think you are, anyway? You have no right to take me anywhere. I just want to get my flipper off. Oh! I don't want to go! You're embarrassing me! Oh! Let me go! Oh! I'm going to smack you! Oh, and what's this? Where's your Lamborghini, big shot? I'm not gonna forget what I saw. You were making a dirty movie. I was not! Yeah? What do you call it, a pg? It was not a movie. It was a short. Oh! Stop this car! I'm getting out! Oh, no, you're not! We're going the wrong way! I know. I'm trying to get us on the freeway. Whoa, whoa, whoa! That was it, dumbo. You missed it. I got it. Hold on. What are you doing? Where's the freeway? I got it. Look for a place to turn around. Are you doing this on purpose? Oh, I see what's happening, and you don't fool me a bit. Look out! You had this planned the whole time. Trying to scare me, huh, you little creep? Well, it's not gonna work. I'm enjoying it, see? I love this. Boy, are you a nut. Where's that freeway? Uh-oh. What's he supposed to be doing, shooting at us? Bang, bang, yourself, Mac. Get down! What are you doing? That's it. That's it! I knew I'd find it! The freeway! End of the line, folks. So what happens now, you turn around and take me home? Looks like I have to. Aah! You're insane! Kenny! Kenny! Kenny, stop! Stop! Stop! Aah! Whoa! He's back! I don't believe it! Wow! Amy, come here and look! Isn't it great? Hot! You wait right here. This won't take long. - Uh-oh. Look out. - Oh, brother. Alright, now. No running. Stay single file. Hey, look! The car! It's back! Hey, come on! It's back! What happened to it? Who is responsible for this? Who set off that alarm? Good lord. Is this our car? Yes, sir. It is. You! Young lady! Do you have an explanation to offer? Sure don't, Jack. Excuse me. Well, who does? Ask bozo. Bozo? Dantley! How did you get it back? Let's just say... I found it. And what about the police? You've talked to them? They are aware of this? No. They don't know a thing. You should have. They should be informed. What's the difference? You got the car back, didn't you? Alright, everybody. Back inside. The fire drill is over. Uh, Mr. Bacon? Yes, Dantley? There is one thing. What is it? I'd like my diploma. Yes, of course. It's in my office. Kenny, can I talk to you? What do you want? What happened? Money wasn't good enough? Couldn't get along with Wayne? Should have called me. Kenny, listen to me, please. You need money, another car, a job. Give you my best recommendation. I got it! Ta-da! Congratulations. Where you going with my Diplo... Kenny, tell me what I got to hear. Please. So long, Mr. McGrath. Kenny. Kenny, please. Hey, Kenny, where you going? Stick around. Meet me after school. Nah. What about the car? Going to buy it? Nope. What? It's a terrific car. Superior mags, Mercury tubes, Gabriel shocks. Why don't you buy it, Kootz. Hey, Kenny. Where you going? Hey, Kenny? Hey, you with the funny walk. Come on. You're not all that tough. Give me my diploma. You think I spent five years here for an empty envelope? Oh... danger! You mad because I gave the car back? Ha ha! Ah, I see what it is. Any guy...
