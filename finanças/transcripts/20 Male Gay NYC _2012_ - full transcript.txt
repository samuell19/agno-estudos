- [Renato Voiceover] Well everyone's a little bit gay, but the whole point, that's already putting things in a box, the point is that everyone's a little bit different. But yeah, I would identify as gay because it's easier to do that, but that doesn't mean that I don't wanna fuck women every so often. - [Alex Voiceover] I mean obviously I'm gay, but I don't identify with the gay community. - [Alden Voiceover] I recently came out of the closet just about a year ago, so I've just run through that whole self-labeling process, and it was something that initially I didn't at all. I knew that I liked men but the word gay itself didn't seem like it described who I was. - [Nico Voiceover] I don't think being gay is something that really is a big facet of my personality. It's not something that I think about every day. - I don't know, when people ask me if I'm gay kind of just without thinking, I usually respond with, "I like guys." It means more than just your sexuality now, I think. Cause I think now it's sort of become an identity that I don't necessarily identify with completely. - The idea of community is different definitely in New York than in other places. I think in other places it's a support system, and in New York, being gay is not as big of an obstacle as other places, so the idea of community sort of fades away. - I feel like sometimes I avoid having too many gay male friends, because I automatically compare myself to them, all the time. - Potentially a stereotype of the gay community is that all gay guys are just trying to sleep with each other, and that even if they're friends, they're just waiting until they, like, that something that becomes more than that. - [Ken Voiceover] I would say all of my close gay friends I've either like, had a sexual encounter with, or it's been on the table. - Like being new to the city, I really only had one friend when I moved here, and just trying to meet new people, like if I'm not going to have sex with you, (snaps fingers) that tends to be the conversation stopper when they're like, "Oh, come over" and I'm like, "Can we meet somewhere public?" - The guys that I'm more interested in are more masculine, or come across as straight, straight-acting in the sense that they're not flamboyant, and I know that I am very flamboyant. But I like someone that can counter my craziness. - Masculine men tend to be attracted to masculine men, and feminine men seem to be attracted to masculine men as well. - I feel like also in the gay community there's a lot of people who are trying so hard to act overly masculine, just because they're like, "No, I'm the super butch gay guy, "like, I'm cool, I'm chill, I'm a bro." And it's like, that's just as bad. - Lady GaGa is a straight woman who's co-opted gay culture because it works for her. And for every suicide she's prevented with her awful music, great. That's great. But I think these gay men who are trying to behave like women and who are responding to women, women can be great role models but I think we need gay male role models. - Like I grew up in a somewhat urban neighborhood, and there were a lot of black and latino guys around me, and I often find myself attracted to black and latino guys, like straight-acting guys, and I wonder how much that has to do with, well I just realized that that has a lot to do with how I grew up. - It's like, okay, I'm really insecure about myself but I'm gay. I can adopt this gay stereotypical personality and then I will just be the gay guy, and people will be my friend just because I'm the gay guy that the other fag hags will get, your other gay friends, and you know exactly how to act and you don't even really have to be yourself. And then if someone doesn't like you, then they don't like you just cause you're that one gay guy. You're not putting yourself out there at all, you're just hiding behind what people expect you to act like. - And I think a lot of gay people hold onto this idea of individuality cause you spend so much of your childhood and early teens feeling repressed and confused, and not understanding why you don't fit in with the other boys and stuff, and then you realize that you're really fucking special and you get all this other kind of attention, and then you move to New York, and you go to the Boiler Room, and everyone's getting that attention. I'm just at the point where I'm starting to process that. - I would say that I do like other gay guys. It's a difficult question because there are people I don't like and there are people I do like, and some of them are gay and some of them are not gay. I tend to be friends with more straight guys than gay guys. - There definitely is a reason for this stereotype of a certain type of gay person who looks a certain way, dresses a certain way, has a nice body, and is also very dumb. And I suppose that that kind of person, I don't really like them. - You know, I've realized, I thought-- for awhile I just thought that I just hated gay people, but I think that I really just don't like people in general. - But also there are one's that I'm just like, I don't want anything to do with you. I don't wanna be your friend, you don't interest me in the slightest. - People who say, "I hate gay guys" are really reductionist, and they're boiling things down to stereotypes that I don't even think they believe in. I think it's a way of seeming more masculine, of like, oh I don't identify with those boa-wearing gay guys type thing, but I mean what does it matter if someone's wearing a boa and someone isn't? I think that says more about the people who hate gay guys than it says anything about gay guys. - If you were to just say gay guys, an image pops into my head that I guess I'm not so fond of. - Do I like gay guys? No, I mean I don't really like gay guys, or I have sort of a complicated experience when I meet gay people. I have a friend who coined this term, he calls it like, IGH, Irrational Gay Hatred, which is the same as when two gay men meet each other, they immediately dislike each other, which I actually find to be really true. I find that when I meet another gay guy, it's almost like you're either sort of instantly attracted to each other, or you're repelled. - Sometimes in conversations I say that I don't like stereotypical New York gays. And I think there's a part of that that's like self-hate, but I think there's also a part of me that-- Well okay, I think that it has to do with something in me just hates the showiness of it. The idea that when pride becomes something more than pride, it becomes, I'm even more unique than you are. - I think that this idea that we hate stereotypical gay guys is based on other people's stereotypes, and I don't understand why the gay community has chosen to embrace what hateful people outside of the community have decided to state, to say about us. I think saying you hate a stereotypical gay guy is saying that you hate a person, not a sexual orientation. And if you hate a person for the way they act, there's something wrong with that to begin with, but to blame it on their sexuality, to say that because they're gay they act in this particular way, or that because they're gay I hate them and I hate the way they've chosen to represent themselves is so backward-thinking, and I think is rooted in insecurity. - I just feel like it's kind of silly to group yourselves based on sexuality, and when a cultural group makes the center of, all they have in common is their sexuality, so the center of gay culture is sex. - Behavior that would otherwise be called quote unquote slutty is maybe not considered so in the gay community, and I think that's problematic. I mean it's probably because there's no woman involved, so there's no-one to really properly call us that, but I think, I think I've exhibited behavior in the past that if my straight friends exhibited it, someone in my friend group maybe would have said something. And I think no-one ever said anything to me. - Me and my boyfriend, our one year anniversary, it's this month actually, and he was saying that, "Oh, you know, one year for gay relationships, "that's like seven years." - I mean I guess that if I really wanna parse it out, I couldn't give you any real reason why, when I see a 90 pound boy in a tank top screaming, I'm just like, No, no, I'm sorry, you know what it is? I think what it is, is that I think what stereotypical gay guy has come to mean in our culture is totally derivative of straight culture, actually. - [Cole Voiceover] If you go to a gay club now, it's the same horrible top-40 shit that you hear on the radio, and that's-- even the things we look for in guys, it's very Justin Bieber-y, One Direction, little pop perfect twink, muscle-y. It's very basic. It's very basic. And I feel like we're still not completely accepted by society, so we feel the need to try and become more like them, but we're not. We're just becoming like a caricature of pop culture and it's kinda gross. - [Alex Voiceover] Sometimes I feel like the whole scene is like super fake. Like people will be like, "Oh my God, hi, how are you? "It's so good to see you!" And then turn around and be like, "Oh, that bitch!" So, like I don't know, that kind of freaks me out. Just like, what are people saying about me? - [Dan Voiceover] I'm always surprised that while gay people are always fighting to fit in and be accepted by others, they're not always the most accepting people. Cause when someone new comes into a room, it's immediately like, you have to win me over rather than me welcoming you.
