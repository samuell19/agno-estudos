Good morning Dina! No, a pan just fell down. - Morning. - What can't you do? Okay... I'm on my way. See you soon. You're making an awful racket. - What are you up to? - We're just throwing pots and pans around. - One pot and one pan. - Several times. When we live together, there won't be any piles of dishes. - I have to go. - Already? - I have to help Dina with the van. - Tell her we'll help with the move. - Where is that? - Corner of Weser and Weichsel street. Have you bought a milk frother at last? No. We're not paying any agency fees! And we don't want solid fuel heating. THREE ROOMS / KITCHEN / BATHROOM On three. One... two... Perfect. Can I see? Oh, it's analogue... Excuse me. Do you know where Philipp is? - Philipp? - Yes. - Who's moving in here? - Juliane Maier. Welcome. Welcome to Wiebke and Dina's new apartment share! Thank you! That was really fast! Even the washing machine's in. But now we have two washing machines - that's one too many. And that's why Wiebke, who is my best friend Philipp's older sister, is giving her washing machine up for adoption! It's a top loader though. You can't put anything on it. Top loader for grabs! And help yourselves to the pizza and the drinks. Maria! This is Maria, my best friend Philipp's girlfriend. And this is...? Michael. I drove her over here. She was at the wrong house. Applause for Maria! Maria! I didn't mean it like that! Well, I'd be interested in your washing machine... Sure. Wiebke! The young man wants to ask you something! 1. AUTUMN - Bye. - See you. - Bye Maria. - See you. Well then. Thanks a lot. No problem. Would you like to call over maybe, to make sure your washing machine is well looked after at my place? We could have coffee and watch the machine doing it's first load. Why not. - So? How's the apartment search going? - Great... everything's unaffordable. And if it's affordable, then Jessica doesn't like it. What about you? I don't even like the unaffordable apartments. I'd like to live in a palace, but... - my student grant won't stretch that far. - What about your parents? No. Their grant isn't enough either. Our generation is already willing to give up the creative anarchy of guys sharing for a bourgeois couple flat in our mid-twenties. That's according to my father. Only he who changes, stays true to himself. In that case you could also say: Only he who shrinks, grows. You could say that. Tell your father that we're the generation with no money, who will never earn any. We grow by shrinking. There. Never mind. I just won't have any curtains then. I won't be doing any exciting things that need curtains in here anyway. One more attempt. I can do this. Oh Philipp, you're really great marriage material. And I admire your bravery - that you're moving in with Maria. I wish I would meet someone I could move in with. What about your boyfriend? You know what? As a thank you, I'm inviting you to dinner. Friday? I'm visiting my parents in Hanover. - Saturday? - I'm picking Maria up in Freiburg. - Sunday? - I'll be back on Sunday. Great! Sunday evening. You should both come. You're such a great couple. I'm really looking forward to not having to... ...drive across Germany in a car with strangers. And I'm looking forward to standing in line with you at the supermarket... Excuse me, we need to get going. And I'm looking forward to arguing over who does the dishes. It's going to be really fun. And promise we'll get a real telephone when I move in. I don't want to talk with my laptop anymore. We won't have to call each other anymore when we live together. But I call other people too sometimes! - Argument accepted. - Is Thomas moving out now or not? Have they said anything? We've found the absolutely perfect apartment! 3 rooms, kitchen, bathroom, 95m?, balcony, timber floors, stucco... Central heating! ...French doors, big kitchen: Affordable! - Is that Maria? - Yeah. Maria, you can move in! What glamour in my hut! Come in. - This is nice. - It's alright. The real reason for your visit: Follow me. - Unfortunately top loaders have no window. - And you can't put anything on top. Did you sit in front of it and watch it as a kid too? No. We had a TV. Philipp, can I ask you something? Not as a brother, but as a man? If you ask a woman if she has time to go to an exhibition, and she says: Sorry no, and you: Breakfast on Sunday then? And she says: Yes. And you: Okay, give me a call. Does that mean you find her interesting? Or are you trying to find out if she finds you interesting? - What? - Do I have to explain it again? I wouldn't invite her and then tell her to ring me. But if you did, what would it mean? Huh? - I thought as a man, you'd have an opinion. But it's the weekend, and you won't be there anyway. Why would you ring him if you can't go anyway? He doesn't know that I'm not there. - Your phone. - That's him! - Should I tell him you're driving? - No! - So answer it. - But then he'll think I'm interested in him. - Doesn't he think that already? - But I want HIM to be interested. - Maybe that's exactly why he's calling. - But I don't know what to say. He just hung up anyway. So who is driving whom, where? Philipp is driving to Freiburg to collect Maria and I'm driving Swantje to Stuttgart. Philipp's going to take some things too, so we won't need the trailer. - But the van is in the garage. - Oh really? - Swantje, what are you writing there? - For my blog. The two older ones still grew up analogue, but Swantje is already a digital native. - Is Wiebke's car big enough for Maria's things? - She's only got two rucksacks. The internship is starting now, but we'll move properly in November. What kind of an internship is it? - A workshop for the disabled. - And then she'll stay in Berlin? This is generation internship. Wiebke, how many internships have you done? It's my first. - And how are your applications going? - They're going. - And if they don't take you on again? - We'll see. Maybe you should concentrate on your studies, instead of doing assistant photographer jobs? If money's the problem... I want to do these jobs so I can study photography. Could you talk about this later so Philipp can help a bit? - Why is the van in the garage? - Because we're going to the Allg?u. - You're going to the Allg?u? - I'm going. - Alone? - Yes. Hill walking. Would you stop writing everything down? Did you realise an ex-terrorist is presenting a children's programme now? Did you realise Wiebke went red when her phone rang? It would be nice if Wiebke were to find a stable relationship. I'll get it. - Hello. - Good day. We would like to talk to you about the bible. No thanks. Could you drive Swantje to Stuttgart instead of me? Why? - I told Michael I'd go to the lake with him. - Today? - Yes. Change of plans. We have to rethink the entire logistics. - Will you call me? - Yes. - As soon as you get there? - Yes. - Really. - Really, really. Bye. Bye. So, are you looking forward to Stuttgart? Don't worry. What are you studying now anyway? German philology and French. And that's done in Stuttgart because they speak neither French nor German there?! I'm already driving slower than the trucks. I can't go any slower. My secret favourite place. - Shall we go swimming? - Isn't it a bit cold? Nonsense, it's great! Come on in, it's great. By the way, a couple of my mates might be joining us. But they're not here yet, so they probably won't come. Come on. Hey, you dopes! Sieveking, you tosser, I didn't think you'd make it! - Hey! All wet? - Hi. - Come here! - Great that you came. Distelmeyer says himself that since "Old Nobody" - his lyrics just mean what they say. - But no one believes him. Yeah, but is the author a reliable source? I don't think so. - Who else is then? - I don't think so. - Jochen Distelmeyer was the singer who once... - I know. Can I ask you something? Do you really like Maria? Of course. But if you get into one of those photography schools, then you'll go to Flensburg or somewhere. And she's moving to Berlin to be with you and she's reorganising her whole studies to do it. You want two different things that don't fit together at all. It just occurred to me. The false moon is warmer than the real one. I think it's E7. The false moon... I'm going for a walk. - Play something from the second record. - That is from the second record. - You have really nice friends. - Yeah, I'm sorry. - Look. The stars. - Where? Up there. I'm Thorsten by the way. Surprise! I'm the welcoming committee! - Welcome! Hi! - Hi. What the hell?! Hi Philipp, I left a message on your mailbox. The landlord cancelled on us at the last minute. We're running from viewing to viewing and are trying desperately... - This can't be true. - Come on, it'll be alright for a month or so. I've been looking forward to this so much! Didn't you listen to your messages? So it'll be three of us here now? Friends, let's not argue! You know what, I'm inviting you all to dinner. Calm down first and be at mine at nine. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Do we have to clink glasses individually? - Yes! - Don't cross over. - Course we can cross over! - Look me in the eyes! Main thing is that he looks into my eyes! - Are you going to move in together too? - No, no, no. Philipp's not my boyfriend, he's my best friend. This is Maria, his girlfriend. They've just moved in together. It's just a bit cramped now because of complications with the move. I'd like to apologise for the circumstances and I'd like to toast everyone who doesn't cancel at the last minute. But you were the ones who cancelled. There were unacceptable things in the lease. My mother's boyfriend noticed it and wouldn't let her sign the guarantee. Hey, peace! Sometimes you have to cancel! My mother cancelled her own wedding once, to a certain Norbert. - My father did that too. - Also to a certain Norbert? No, to my mother. No sign of him since the late 80s. Hey, my sweetheart made it after all! So, I'd like to make a toast to the love between a man and a woman! Well then. You have really nice friends. - What do you mean? - Dina is cool. Lots of men think Dina is cool. I'm sorry. You are the coolest of course. Is something the matter? I really like you a lot. It's just that... So much has happened to me in the last six months and... Can't we just stay friends? Enjoy a golden autumn? Spring is the time for love anyway! Autumn is the time for friendship. Please. CALL FOR PROPOSALS - DESIGN OF THE CATALOGUE FOR THE EXHIBITION PROJECT "ANTICIPATION" The rent could rise a bit after the basic renovation. Your room... My room... Living room. It's perfect. Well, 980 Euro is a lot of money. We'll earn more money too at some point! Yeah, but right now I get a grant and then I'll be sitting on a mountain of debt. The kitchen is not so great, we could negotiate there. Like those two there? My husband works for the philharmonic orchestra, I run the Berlin office of the Salzburg Festival. Excuse me. We are also very interested! Oh really? - They're moving to Linien street 30? - Yep. - That's where my boss lives. - That's kind of crazy. Hey, can I ask you something? If you start a thing with a woman and then you end it and tell her she's too nice... Michael again? Can't you just forget him?! - Not if I see him constantly. - Then stop! But Dina gets on well with him too... - Sorry. I'm annoying you, right? - No. Maybe he's into Dina, but too considerate to show it in front of me. I'm not saying this as a man, but as a member of the family: The problem is neither Michael nor Dina, but that you fall for guys who ditch you after three weeks. And then you ask me to explain how they think, and I have no idea. I just thought men understand this kind of thing better. - Okay. I'll try to explain it to you... - Do you have to be so loud? Sorry. Did we wake you? - I was having a stupid dream anyway. - What was it? I dreamt that Philipp and I were getting married. Dina was there too and Philipp only danced with her all the time. Only then I noticed that Dina was completely naked. And Philipp said: "Dina is the guest of honour, that's why she can be naked and with her figure, she gets away with it." Come on. Don't take it so seriously. - Were you talking about me? - We were talking about dreams. Oh. I hope all your dreams come true. - What's wrong? - No idea. - In the middle of the intersection! - Is the tank empty? - You were supposed to get fuel! - I got fuel. Wait a minute. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. Why are you moving house this late at night? Apologies. Our car broke down. That gives you no right to disturb the peace at night. Others have to work early on a Monday morning! We're sorry. Firstly, hello... - Shit. - He'll calm down again. - He lives right under us. - So? - Don't you get it? From now on he'll complain every time we move a chair after 10 pm! That took ages. I'd like to wish you all the best for the future. I have something here for you... But Mr. Maubach said I would be transferred! Transferred? I'll have to check that... We'll be keeping hardly anyone on this time, regardless of any upturn... Wesendonk, Wiedemann... Wittkamp! Fancy that! Congratulations. No, skipped a line. Sorry. All the same, merry Christmas, happy New Year and best wishes for your professional future! Thank you. - Can I ask you a personal question? - Yes. If you were me, would you break up with Julian? Julian... oh, the guy whose face I can never remember... This is serious! I broke up with him. - Since when? - A while ago. Philipp? There's quite a delicate story. You're the only one I'm telling. I had an abortion once. It was a while ago, but... the idea of having a child by this guy - at 18- was horrible. And then in November for three days, I was terrified that I was pregnant again. - Despite the pill? - Well... I spent two weeks thinking about breaking up with him after that and then I dumped him. I'm single! I'm free! I can do what I like! There's just one problem. My father already invited Julian and me to go skiing. Now I'll have to ski over the Tyrolean slopes on my own with my father. Unless... you come with me! It'll be great! The first holiday in years without relationship angst and couples shit. Say yes. Say yes. You did this all on your own? You're a sweetheart. Do you know what we could do? We could do my move two days earlier and then celebrate New Year's here. - Wouldn't that be great? - Eh... sure, course. - Aren't you happy? - Yeah, course. - Really, really? - Yeah, yes. Hey, it's Philipp. I can't go skiing after all. I have to do the move with Maria before New Year's. We're driving to Freiburg on the 28th... But we could have a sleigh ride here... if it snows. In case we don't see each other, I hope you have a great, exciting Christmas. So Joseph, the carpenter from Nazareth, made his way to his native town of Bethlehem, in the company of his heavily pregnant wife, Maria. She went into labour as they reached their destination. All lodgings were occupied however, and so she gave birth to her first son in a stable. Swantje! Nobody is forcing you to eat with us, but please put the book away when you're at the table. Philipp! My God, what's the matter with all of you? You seem like you've been exhausting yourselves all year long. Should we put on some other music? There's a great Christmas record by Radiohead. - Radiohead? - Should I look for it? But we always had that Christmas thingy... - The Christmas Oratorio. - By Johann Sebastian thingy. - You want to listen to that old stuff? - Yes! - You have to play it at 33, the lever... - I know! Merry Christmas! I'm coming, I just need to finish scanning. Do you know the song by Die Sterne: "We don't have to do what we can Just because we know that we can." Maybe. No idea. Once you've misunderstood it and heard "scan" instead of "can", from then on you only ever hear: "We don't have to do what we scan Just because we know that we scan." But those are the lyrics. - They're saying "can" and not "scan". - Look. Lovely. I want you to tell me if it's level. Do we have to hang that now? Can't we have a bite first? Sure, we could just open some tins and sit in front of the TV. But we don't have a TV. Thomas, could you just show any emotion? But you're showing so much already. I painted it for you. - Looks like a pregnant pig. - Dad! Thank you mum. You haven't unpacked everything yet. Wow, a projector! One has to buy the affection of one's children these days... Your generation is so social, this way your friends can enjoy it too. - It wasn't that easy financially, but... - Don't exaggerate. - It was expensive. - Waiter, change of subject. - Your father does like to be generous. - Yes, yes... That's fine, but someone has to save too. - Do you really want to argue? - Dad! - Let him! - He likes to shout about the place. It'll pass. - Will you stop picking on me! Me? On you? Oh yes... Shouting and spending money - your father's very good at that. Well, dear family... It's lovely to be together again. As usual, a lot has happened in the past year, but the most significant thing for us was that our youngest child flew the nest. When your mother and I got together back then, and it's over 30 years ago now, we wanted to have a perfect family. Father, mother and three children, all living happily in one small house. And that's what happened. But when the third child was born, we noticed that our relationship was over. But the idea of tearing our small family apart, and of bringing up three children in a divorce made us very sad. So we decided to end our sexual relationship, but to stay together as a family so that you children would have a home. Now that you're all independent it's time you knew the truth. Mum and dad are no longer a couple, but we still care for each other very much. And in future there'll just be a few more people who'll be part of the family. Personally, I'm really looking forward to finally introducing you to Susanne, who has been the woman at my side for the last six years. Naturally, there will be some changes. I'm going to move in with Susanne, your mother will take an apartment in the city. I'm sure you've got a lot of questions now. Perhaps you'll just be very angry with us, but we'll do our best to answer your questions so that this can be a long family Christmas night with questions and answers and good conversations. Is this supposed to be some kind of stupid joke? All my life they've been lying to me about being a couple. But they're just two ex's who'd have split their paths long ago if it weren't for the children. I can't believe it. I could scream. - Hey, calm down! - I don't want to calm down! - I'm not that surprised. - What? - But you've been actually living here! - I didn't notice anything! - But you wrote everything down. Your blog! - There is no blog. Writing blogs is for 30 year olds. I'm writing a novel! I'm going to knock the Christmas tree down! I'll flush the biscuits down the toilet and set it all on fire. The sound is shit. We don't have to keep watching it like this. Okay. I still have work to do anyway. - What is that supposed to mean? - You didn't want to keep watching. No, I meant that we should change something. Oh. Yeah, but the stereo's not set up yet and the speaker cables could be anywhere. I don't feel like it anymore. Well then. Thomas. Could you please explain what our relationship means to you. Don't know... You don't know? Well that's a pretty general question. It's like asking me what the door over there... or your left ear means to me... My left ear? Or your right ear. What would you do if I broke up with you right now? We just moved into this overpriced apartment. - It would be strange timing, wouldn't it? - What would you do? - That's a stupid question Jessica. - What would you do? I might be glad to have some peace. I've waited for four years till you had lived... ...long enough in your "all male flat share". I hunted for this place for the two of us so that our relationship could be as good as it used to be. But I'm cracking up because you're not giving me anything! And now I'm trying to force you to say something, and you just say, "I might be glad to have some peace." I don't have to listen to this! I can have bad sex with someone else! - Dina! - Philipp! Have you got a minute? What's up? My parents gave me a projector and now they're fighting. - My parents broke up. - What? But that was 19 years ago. - Do you want to talk about it? - No. And where are you going to go now? No idea. I'm going to look for my father. Now? Other people are happy if they don't have to... I feel like everything that's going wrong in my life is his fault. If he hadn't left, I'd have a great life now. Not such a shit, problem-filled life. I want to tell him that. Who's texting you the whole time? Dina's asking if we want to celebrate New Year's with her Spanish friends. Felipe! The Spanish are breathing down my neck! Are you coming? Wait, I'll ask Maria if she wants to! What? I can't hear you! Have you already told Dina about your parents? Yeah. Course. You've probably had long conversations about how you're doing. I've spoken to Dina just as little as... Can you go to your window? Does it ever happen that Dina calls and you don't pick up? - Stop it now! - Yeah, go on, shout at me. The one who shouts is in the wrong. Tell me. Have you fallen for her? Yes. Okay. Sure, I can understand that. Dina is pretty great. But then what are we doing here? We're driving my things to Berlin because we want to move in together, right? I'm just not as... great and eloquent and clever as Dina. But somehow I had convinced myself that you love me for who I am. - And I do. - No, you love Dina. That's what you just said. Shit! Please tell me honestly: Who do you think is more amazing? Dina or me? Please get out. - Get out! - What? But... Don't touch me. Get out! Close the door! - Surprise! - Hi. Here, a house-warming present! Bread and salt. Well, the salt's in the bread. Where's Maria? Accidentally, we kind of broke up. Oh God. Yeah, I'll be off then... Take it easy man. What was that? Oh God Philipp. I'm so confused. Christmas was a nightmare, and when you didn't want go skiing, I bumped into Michael and thought: A holiday without boyfriend issues could work really well with Michael... I still feel uncomfortable about it. It's all happening too fast. I'd really love to sit down somewhere, make time stand still, drink tea and live by nature's rhythm. Great idea. Philipp. Don't let me interrupt, but I have to move in here now. Maria! My room in Freiburg has been rented out. So be nice will you and go somewhere else for a few days. I'll find something else as soon as possible. And you can bet on that. - What's the matter? - I don't want that yet. - Am I doing something wrong? - No. Not at all. I just have the feeling that my body needs a break. - We can't do it today anyway. - What? I've quit the pill and I'm on natural contraception now. - If you've got a problem with that say so. - No. Course not. Hello. Hello. We messed up a thing or two towards year's end, didn't we? No. I think we did a really great job. Is that gonna take long? Then I'd like to get a coffee over there. No, I'm done. I think I'd like to get back with Jessica. - Then go after her. - Yeah... But I want her back the way she was before. Yeah, that's what we all want! Stop time in your mid-twenties, or even better, turn the clock back. Tell me, do you have a new problem or is this still the old one? My problem is that I feel like I've murdered a small child! You mean Maria? Well she's rather cute indeed, but she's clearly an adult. Right. On the other hand, Dina always makes me feel like we're meant for each other. But then she's always with these guys. These Smurfs! And where do you see yourself now, in the spectrum between Smurf and non-Smurf? - Hello. - Hello. - Well? Hello. - Hi. - I'm Swantje. Swantje wanted to celebrate New Year's with us. Sure. Have a seat. It makes me sick! What is it about Dina that all men love? You're into her too! Can you explain it to me? What's so great about Dina? You mean: What does she have that you don't? - Exactly! Well, Dina, as opposed to you, has the advantage of not being my sister. You know what? Fuck you all. I want the new year to be just as explosive as this rocket! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! - Do I have to do this on my own? Four! - Three! Two! One! Shit! I don't want the new year to be like that rocket, but like this bottle of champagne. - What kind of shit is this? - What's going on with the bottle? - Come on Philipp, it doesn't matter. - Is it screwed on or what? Come on. Group hug! Happy New Year! - Cheers! - Happy New Year. Your Spaniards know how to party. We could learn a thing or two. They can just go back home to where it's warm. - Spain is cold in the winter too. - Germany's always cold. I wouldn't see it so negatively. MUMMY AND DADDY ARE NO LONGER A COUPLE BUT THAT'S SINCE 1993 ...YOU ARE THE WINNER OF OUR CALL FOR CREATIVE PROPOSALS... 3. SPRING That was pretty... interesting. Yeah. Maybe, in a former life we were... married. Former life... Hippie shit! Do you think we should start something? And leave our respective partners? No. My thoughts exactly. - Oops. Sorry. - The film was over anyway. I only wanted to say: I'm moving out. What? The good news is: I got the job. - With that publisher? Ostermann und Sch?nbaum. Wiebke, can I ask you something? Is it my fault that you're moving out now? Was the Michael thing too stupid of me? I'd be so sorry if that were the case. Don't worry about it. I just realised that flat shares don't really suit me. But we had a nice time didn't we? Sure we had a nice time. Wiebke, you're so sweet. I'm so sorry that this nonsense with Michael has come between us. Dina, I'm over it. Look! The dinghy from the photo where we're holding melons! - No, that was blue. - No. - Yes, it was. - No, that was it. - It was blue. No. Wiebke? - It doesn't matter which dinghy it was. - Yes it does. You don't want that old thing, do you? We bought that in '93 in Sardinia. - Don't mess everything up again. - Found it! I won, I won! I was right. Hi. - I just got up. - I baked muffins. - That's sweet. Our seminar tomorrow is cancelled because of that crazy... What's crazy? I hope you'll still visit me here, even if I don't have a garden anymore. Mum? Sorry. Leave me a minute. I'll be fine in a minute. Mum. This really is a very nice apartment. And one day your mother took the boat out of the trunk, and it came in contact with the hot exhaust, and it burned a hole in the rubber. - That was... - Dad! What is it? Nothing. - Maybe we should... - No. - I think it would be fair... - No. I think I have to tell you something that I've never told you before. Sorry. It's quite clear that we did mess up on this one. We thought we were doing everything right... We did our best... And I don't have a manual on how to do it better. I always thought you had one. I would say life is... like a rusty machine that you found in the attic: You don't know what it's for and there's no manual. So you try it out and when you press a button, something unexpected happens. Then you give it to your children and at that moment you should be honest and say: "Try it out yourselves. I have no idea how the thing works." - Now that's parenting! - Could you listen for a minute? Mum isn't moving out. She's going to stay here for now. - What? But... - Dad, no discussion now! - But the house is... - Please let's not discuss this now! - I've found such lovely old things... - Dina? Philipp! Where are you? Can we see each other? No, I'm in Hanover. Dismantling our family home. Oh shit, of course. It must be awful. - Michael cheated on me. - Why? - I don't know why. - I meant to say with whom. Don't know that either! But I'm breaking up with him. I'm worried about your mother. It would be good if someone was here over the next few days. I'm moving next week myself. I have a job. I've an internship with Alex Sass. It's a great opportunity, but I could cancel. I can't, I have compulsory attendance. What are you all looking at me for? New cartridge. New cartridge! Are you asleep? We'll do another one standing. Put your hand on your belly and hold the can like this. You're proud of both. Look down a little. Exactly. Watch out! Go home if you don't want to work! No, no, no, no, the mattress is going there. That's not going to fit. That sounded like something fell over. Doesn't matter. I have to get there somehow. - Wiebke. See you later. - What? You're leaving? I can't handle that Philipp's here too. Sorry. Tell me, should I be worried about you? No. You seem out of sorts since Christmas. You've gone all silent. See what I mean. Philipp, what's the matter? Are you drunk or something? Should we not talk about how we're really feeling? I'm fine. You're lying. What am I supposed to do? Cry? Fuck this. - Hello Mum! - Hello Wiebke. - Mum? - I can barely hear you. There's a storm here. I think the tree is about to fall over. The tree never fell over before. Couldn't you do me a favour and come here? Mum, things are chaotic here. I have to work on Monday... Yes, I apologise. You have your own life. It's normal that children should be independent at some stage. - What is it now... - Wiebke! I... Sorry. I really just wanted to say... I thought it was bad of me not to stay till the end. I'd like to make up for it now and help you somehow. Alone? I don't think I'll go to the cinema alone. Together, alone? How does together, alone work? So, you in Stuttgart and me here or what? Parallel? Interesting concept. No... I don't think I've got time. I have images to scan. Tell me, do you know... that song by Die Sterne: "We don't have to do what we can, just because we know that we can." Yeah, you always think they're saying "scan". I used to dance to that as a kid. Hello? Is anyone here? Mrs. Wittkamp? Why are all the lights out? I took out the fuses in case lightning hits. But you can't sit here in the dark all night. You could help me carry the mattress upstairs. Why? I have a whole house to myself, eventually I can sleep in all the rooms. There, something moved. The tree could fall over. It's good that Swantje moved out. If the tree had fallen on her while she was sleeping then all the work would have been for nothing. What work? Well, twenty years of changing nappies, feeding, hiding Easter eggs, buying Christmas presents, baking birthday cakes, sewing carnival costumes, taking photos, going on holiday, blowing up dinghies. Children are a lot of work. Then a tree falls on them and it's all over. - But no tree has fallen on anything. - Right. You've such a practical disposition. Shame it didn't work out between you and Philipp. He might change his mind. He's going through a phase. And I'm supposed to wait until your son is out of that phase? We were on first-name terms weren't we? I'm still Ingrid. - I'm off then. - Wiebke! That was a short apartment share. Sorry. Maybe I'll move into your room. There'd be more space for the projector. Are you ill? I feel sick. - Are you ill? - I feel sick. Maybe you're pregnant. Dear Mr. Wittkamp, we must sadly inform you that the admissions committee has deemed your documentation as inadequate. You may collect your portfolio and documents until August 1st... Have you ever thought about whether the bible still holds answers to today's life? Yes I have. Thank you. Bye. What do you think of it? It tries to overwhelm, but it doesn't transcend. This is all total bullshit. Ah, you'll get there. Philipp! Visitor for you. Look after your mother will you. Hello, Christian. Ingrid. Sorry... I don't think it's going to happen today. Sorry. What's the matter? Nothing's the matter. Because Dina broke up with you or what? No. Are you on the pill? Course I'm on the pill. Should I help pay for it somehow? You're the first guy to think of that. Should I? Hey, I have a boyfriend. Does he share the costs? No he doesn't. But I'd find it a bit tasteless if my affair were to help pay for my pill. I get the impression that you sleep with me more than with him. You might laugh now but I really do like him. Is that your catalogue? Yes. Show me. I think I'm going to end it. End what? End it with you. I can imagine that you think everything has gone wrong now. "We lied to our children for 20 years and now it's all over." But I think my childhood was really nice. That doesn't mean that the present and the future have to be nice too. And the other way round: It means that the present and the future can be good, even if the past was bad. Hello? Dina? It's not a good time. Can I call you back? Okay. Bye. - Something wrong? - I need to use the telephone too. Sorry. Was that the girl with whom you're so close? - Dina, yes. - And she's in love with you now, is she? Right, don't play these half-baked friendship games if she wants more. She's always calling, she's obviously into you. I can understand you, she's nice but not particularly pretty... Okay, hey, sorry. You didn't ask for my opinion. I'll be off then. Your father and I were really only friends too. He always wanted more, I was never so sure. Maybe I should have stood my ground back then. But then we wouldn't exist. Well maybe that would be better? When I see how you battle through life. Maybe I'd have had very different children with another man. Much more successful, with far fewer problems. As far as I know, other people's children have problems too. Well. I'm pregnant. Yes. And? Does Michael know? Yes, but he hasn't been in touch. Philipp, you have no idea how much I need you right now. Would you like to be the man at my side for a while? Do you think we could start a kind of platonic, patchwork, substitute family? I can't even rent out this stupid room at the moment. Maybe my mother would like to move in. Then you could become a platonic substitute family and I'll do something else in the meantime. You have to tell me if I'm asking too much of you. How are you doing? I see a cloud that looks like... Jesus. I see one that looks like Karl Marx. And I see a cloud that looks like... a cloud. You know, really cloudy. Yes, I see that one too. What are you doing at the weekend? Packing. Packing what? - I'm moving out. I broke up with Jessica. - What?! What...? And you just mention it casually like that? Yes. Hey, tell me all about it! Well, I mean, how are you? Well I have to find a room in a new flat share now. Jessica wants to move out too but she thinks I should move out first. WE'RE GETTING DIVORCED - BUT THAT'S NON OF THE CHILDREN'S BUSINESS MUM'S SITTING ON THE SOFA DEPRESSED AND STARING INTO THE GARDEN. WIEBKE DOES THE LOTTO. SHE GOT 2 RIGHT. MUM THINKS WE PREFER DAD. MOM HAS A BREAKDOWN. DAD'S BIRTHDAY. MUM GAVE HIM A LANGUAGE COURSE. MY WISH FOR THE NEW YEAR: I'D LIKE TO GIVE MY PARENT'S RELATIONSHIP A LITTLE JOLT... 4. SUMMER I'd like to have been the one in this story, who stayed and took responsibility. And not the asshole who ran off. But you already are the asshole who ran off. You can't be the man who took responsibility. But you could be the asshole who ran away but then came back. Yes. I'd like to be that guy. And what if I'm not even pregnant? If I had an abortion? Did you? Philipp! Well? What? No, I don't believe it. - Darling! - Congratulations. Thank you. Hello, I'm Victoria. Philipp. You master photographer! You're going to be famous. A toast to my best friend Philipp, who'll be studying in D?sseldorf next semester! Cheers! Michael and I also have something to announce. You all know about the offspring - that's trivial. This is about something fundamental. We're moving in together. - Can a washing machine fit through there? - Mine fitted through. That's not a washing machine, it's a top loader. I'd leave it here anyway. I'd like to know what's really going on. Why don't you just give up the lease, instead of subletting? Well to be honest, I'm moving in with my girlfriend, and you just never know... But that means if your girlfriend kicks you out, you'll kick me out? Call me when you've changed your mind. And better take that top loader with you. Why on earth did you get a top loader? That's my old one. I took it back from Michael. Oh really? Can I ask you something? As a brother, as a guy, or as a human? Forget it. The pipe doesn't fit. I'd like to paint the bedroom. Then you can take down the woodchip. Or maybe I should sand the floorboards first. That's a shitload of work. You know what? I think all of this is massively overrated! Parquet floors and stucco and French doors, a balcony, no woodchip and definitely no laminate! As if it were a matter of life and death, but it's just an apartment. Everybody's sitting on top of each other in their old buildings waiting to be happy! Thousands of happiness candidates with stucco and French doors who think they can only be happy when there's no woodchip on the wall! That's so ridiculous! I think the machine is broken. Come on in! It's wonderful! You're not expecting any friends, are you? No. Why? Just wondering. I had actually planned to just hang out here with you on our own. Ready? Come on, just one last... really nice family portrait of you all. There, in front of the house! Come a bit closer... exactly. Philipp, a little more over there... Great. And smile. Yes... We'll see each other anyway... Yes... - I'm not going back to Berlin either. - Really? - But you're not moving back in here, are you? - No, I... I'm taking a trip... to visit the men I was with before your father. How many were there? Three. You probably think it's weird, but I feel that it's important for me now. - We don't think it's weird at all. - No. I think... Yes, maybe an impulse trip to the Baltic. - Alone? - Yes. Or with a few friends. We'll see. We could go away together, alone too. So at the same time, only in different places. Or the same place, just not at the same time. And apart from that? Tomorrow is the exhibition opening. - The one you did the catalogue for? - Yeah. Nothing on Saturday and on Sunday I'm meeting Victoria. Who's Victoria? A girl from university. We study together. Aha, Victoria... Well then. Alright then. Take it easy. - You too. - Bye. Bye. - Good morning. - Hey, Philipp. Well? See, looks like I'm growing up. Professional movers. Let me introduce you to my parents. Mum! Dad! Can you come here? Oh isn't this lovely. I finally get to meet the father of my grandchild! - No, we're just friends. - This is Philipp. - Oh, not Michael anymore? - I was never Michael. - Shall we go? - I can't just leave now. Feel like helping? - That's okay. - Thanks. - We've transferred the rest. - Yeah. Bye. - Oh, hello. - Hello. Well? Mum, Dad, can I introduce: This is Michael. A doctor? Do you know Prof. Dr. Vincent Assmann? Oh isn't this lovely. I finally get to meet the father of my grandchild! Sorry, we were very busy all day in the clinic. - This is my mother. - Hello. Gabi. - Hello. Margot. - Gabi. - Werner. - Dina, hello. - Gabi. Eh, sorry. We have to go. Philipp. I went to this doctor as a kid. He used to say: "Now this won't hurt much". Then he'd take out a massive needle. Interesting. Do you want to talk as we walk? I don't like saying this, but you're still running after Dina like a puppy. She clicks her fingers and you do things I would never ask of you. - Just because we're late for the opening... - Get this into your head: Dina's not interested in you. That's it. Dina flirts with every guy in sight. In this respect, she's got a screw loose. And I don't want to have to watch it anymore. - But I'm over Dina. - Tell that to your granny. Do you want to be running after Dina when she's a granny herself, with ten grandchildren by five different men? No? Then go up there now and tell her: "Dear Madam, we can't be friends, because I'm constantly falling in love with you. Thanks for everything!" Bye. Well this is a hive of activity. My dear... We want to have it ready before we leave tomorrow. We're treating the young couple to a summer holiday. Two and a half generations together in harmony. - Are you going on holidays? - Holidays? No. Although I could go to Bavaria and confront Michael's father. What? Oh, didn't I tell you already? I found your father again through the internet. He's got a practice in Munich. I could sue him for 20 years of alimony, but I won't do that. The part the father plays is overrated anyway. Well I think that's quite an extreme perspective. Hello. We would like to talk to you about the bible. No, sorry. - Well I have... - Is Thomas here? Thomas Richter designed these rooms and created the comprehensive catalogue. One could say that this is the exhibition for the catalogue. Hey. Hello. Would you like another drink? No. That's your new boyfriend, yeah? No. That's Stefan. He's more into guys. Oh. There's my boyfriend. This is a bit weird but his name is Philipp too. - Hi. I'm Philipp. - Hi. Philipp. - Cheers. - Cheers. That was a success. Hey, they're all mad. Yeah? They're all crazy. I have to drop off a ton of business cards at home first. Not sure if they'll all fit in my room. And later? Nothing. Bed. Fancy a night cap or something? - Yeah. - I'll call you. We've been telephoning for seven months now. First you had a girlfriend, and telephoning isn't cheating. Then you split up and I thought great, now it can happen. And what happened? Nothing. And I'm not going to put up with you meeting some Victoria, while I'm waiting for you to finally do something. But you don't do anything. So I'm doing something now. But I'm only doing it once. I can't come now. I have to rest a bit first. - Sorry. - What's that supposed to mean? - I'll follow you as soon as I can. - Dina, come on, I can't stop here. Come now Dina. Look at the stars. - Are you joking? - No, look. He's at a cabin. I can't give you a number. And this cabin is... No... Really? You're not by any chance on your way to see a certain Dr. Bernd Reinink? I am. I say I have no children, and you say you are my children... and really, we're both right. There were strong women in my generation, who made a conscious decision against having a male presence. Not as a deserted victim, but as a free autonomous person. Your accusing undertones... Accusing undertones? But we are basically complete strangers. We could get to know one another of course but... Stop. Have you ever stopped for a moment to think about how it feels? To grow up with the constant knowledge that something's missing? All of your friends have two parents. Now they're not all happy families, they split up too. But at least they're around! Only in my case, there was always just a big question mark. And the knowledge that something went wrong. - And there was never any money. - I'm sorry. Maybe... your mother was not actually capable of giving you the security... - Not a word about my mother! - Please calm down now... Don't get familiar with me! Look, I don't have such a problem with it. But you really ought to deal with the fact that for many people, your attitude to life, makes you seem like quite an asshole. When will we get there? According to GPS it'll be another 8 hours. Mum. Dad. I need to tell you something. But I'm not sure exactly what. I... have to think about it first. But I can't think when you're around. I think I'll go home and think about it there. Well I don't know either. What don't you know? What this is all supposed to mean. Nothing. Should we somehow celebrate our new found familial relationship? By sleeping with each other again? You're not serious, are you? No. Yes. Shall we just... ...go back down? - Yes. - Yes. 5. AND THEN Well I don't get it. Looks like furniture. It's about cracks in the foundations, ruptures, crises, emotional glaciation. The text is for that picture over there. Oh. You did that one didn't you? Pretty heavy stuff. I would say that it tries to overwhelm, but it doesn't transcend. Yeah, I agree completely. I think the glaciation thing is cooler somehow. - Hey, anyone for coffee? - Yes. Do we know each other from somewhere? Yes. Aren't you... - Did you once live somewhere? - I still live somewhere. Would you like to go somewhere else to think about where we once lived?
