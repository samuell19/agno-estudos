Distributed by TOEI Company A co-production between Central Arts and Kitty Films A HOMANCE Coffee! Give me two. - How many? - Two. Thank you for coming! Bro, are we closing? Yeah! Understood. Hey! Come back again anytime you want! Bro! He is here! Stop him! How dare you try to sell drugs in our turf? Call Fujii! Call Fujii! Yamazaki, long time no see. - Nice to see you again. - Call Fujii! What's your business? Did you really think nothing would happen if you sold drugs in our turf? I think your clan provoked first. Yamazaki. Your face looks good. Mr. Ikehiro. I only have one life too. Yamazaki. I think you already know... ...that our clan has finally expanded over West Japan. Strange things will happen one after another. You'd better prepare for that. Otherwise, you will go down hard. - lzawa. - Yes! Selling drugs is our main business. Don't touch the girls. Where did you come from? I said: "Where did you come from?" It reads "Oki". What is "Oki"? Which prefecture? Hey, you! Which prefecture? I don't know. What a funny bastard. What have you been doing? I don't remember. Stop pretending to look cool. Nobody does that kind of thing nowadays. You want to be one of us, right? I know it already. If so, you have to clarify some things first. Right? - Do we have to do that for this random bastard? - Shut up and watch! Listen. This is our territory. If you don't answer properly, I will kick you out. We are stronger than you think! You have to tell us more about yourself if you need help! My bad. I really don't remember a thing. So, are you one of those retards... ...who have amnesia? That's what the doctor said. Thank you! - Amnesia? - Yes, it seems like it. He might be a spy from West Japan. Or maybe even a cop from another region? Cops from West Japan are good actors anyways. One thing is clear, there will be a war. - lzawa. - Yes? What are you thinking about? Nothing. Are you thinking about how to run away? No way, Bro. You bastard! It's oil. Damn! It's been already an hour. What are we waiting for? Go talk now. Okay... I want to discuss something interesting with you. You can earn money. It's burglary though. Do you know what "burglary" means? We can split the money into three. Do you know what "split" means? Shut up, bastard! The store has no alarm. The guards might come randomly. You wait out there... ...and deal with the guards if they arrive. Didn't you say that there was no alarm? Maybe it was another store. Shut up! I will kill you later! Oh, he has done it for us! Let's go! You, wait! Hey there! I need to ask you something. It's about your body. You bastard! Say something! Hey! That's enough. I don't think he is a spy or a cop. - What the hell is he? - It doesn't make sense. Perhaps... ...common sense doesn't matter to him either. Do you still need something? Don't you feel cold in that? Sorry for my underlings' rude treatment earlier... But I am forced to deal with any outsider in our turf. Please understand. I am Michio Yamazaki from the Oshima Clan. You don't get intimidated at all. It doesn't matter to me. Not a spy. Not a cop. Not even a homeless. I am confused. I am a human. Let's have a drink later then. Okay? Mr. Yamazaki. Do you have any job that I could do? A job? Yes. What kind? Doing nothing would be the best though. That sounds like I'd better not hang out with you. I will do something about it. Thank you. Hey! Don't go through the bar. Go around it. Mister, please stop! - What's the big deal? - This is not that kind of place! No! I told you I would pay you! - Hey! - Mist... Here. If you need to talk, talk to me. What is this, bastard? Huh? I don't understand how your boss has trained you. There is no bar in this area that doesn't provide sex! What do... You bastard. Who are you? Move over. Are you alright? Wait. You come with me. Sorry. I didn't mean to... Want to hop on? Eh? Eh! You're kidding! For real! Come in. Ah, shoes! Shoes! I am pathetic. I didn't go to the university. All of the girls at the bar have so much energy, don't they? I ended up like this though. I have an inferiority complex toward them. I am pathetic, right? I hope you get your memory back soon. Why? Because you have amnesia. That's what everybody says. You must be struggling so much. That... uhm... ...how do you call that? I'm sorry! It's cold, isn't it? Right? Please, have a drink! Thank you. Things will get more complicated if you don't get your memory back soon. You cannot sleep with girls because you don't know how. We can't. The Boss told me not to touch you. - Is this everything? - Sorry. We have to stop selling drugs now. You have to gather more girls. That's the only way to get cash for now. I know it. Then try harder. Understood? How much money do you think we need for a war? Their clan is getting bigger every day. Your meager capabilities are just not enough. You need to clear your head and get over this crisis. Did you get it? - Yes! - Yes! Call the Boss now. Yes! What do you think about him? That guy? He is strange, isn't he? He is indeed. Can he be useful? Yes, for some jobs. He can at least be a bodyguard. Hey, stop the car. Is that a bar over there? Yes! It's Rouge. Wait here. Hey! Is there anyone? What are you doing? I am fucking. Fucking who? Did you fuck her? Yes. Fu... Mr. Fu. It felt very weird when I did it for the first time. It smelled bad. Mr. Fu. You don't want to bring back your memories... ...do you? Do you really think so? - Convenient. - Uh? Because this is more convenient. Excuse me! Bro, right now we... What are you doing here? - Wait, did you sleep with one of our girls? - Stop it! But... this bastard... Just do your thing. Okay. I need you to come to the usual place. You're a mystery. Mr. Fu. You're the same, Mr. Yamazaki. Bye, then. - Fujii? - Yes? People say that you can become a good vault guard because you are clever. But I am still not sure if I can rely on you for this job. Boss, I am your right-hand man. Your right-hand man. Right-hand man? Mr. Right-Hand Man, become a good vault guard then! Okay? Yes! It's time to bring a woman... You always say "yes, yes, yes." Do you really pay attention to what I am saying? That's what I want to see. Boss! From Police HQ to Yodobashi No. 3. There has been an incident in the Yodobashi district No. 2. It is escalating. The victim, Eiichi Oshima, was transported right away to the General Hospital by 911. Yodobashi No. 3! Please, go to the General Hospital right now. Yes, understood. It's ridiculous to rely on fortunetelling to solve this kind of problem. Michio. I've already told him the situation. He said he would take all of the drugs. Yes. They have 1 0 million in cash. Yes. Go to the usual place when they contact you. You cannot go alone, bring someone. Yes. - Michio! - Yes? That'll be just in case. You may go alone if you really want to. Yes. The Boss will die sooner or later. Several days later, I will become... -...we will see! - Yes. You are supposed to shoot the deputy boss of the Asahi Clan. Not the chief boss? What are you thinking? Our chief boss has taken the hit. It's because we have to make a deal with them. A deal? Had they wanted to, they could've shot me. Why didn't they, huh? If you have a brain, think! Huh? Huh? Huh? I want to make a long-term deal with him. He wants my brain. From now on... ...we have to focus more on my clever brain than our reputation. You have to learn how to use computers... ...to manage our clan better rather than being obsessed about our reputation. Then, you will get promoted sooner or later. I can foresee a substantial promotion. I'll leave it to you. What's wrong? It's delicious. It's delicious. I am happy... ...that we are eating delicious food like this together. Even now. Even now... ... I am taking it for granted. It's really delicious. Thank you. - Good morning. - Good morning. Are you sure? - Yes. - No. Which one is it? Yes! Amnesia, huh? This is strange! There is no glove! - What do you mean by "glove"? - There is no fingerprint. Those kinds of fingerprints usually don't help much though. Hey! Bring some tea! Ah, Captain! We have this much information on yakuza. Do you want me to search other departments? - Please do. - Yes! Do you think he is one of the spies hired by the Asahi Clan? I think so, since he was at the scene. He pretends to have amnesia. He must be a good actor. He must be really good. It looked very realistic. He sneaked into the Oshima Clan with that act. He must be very well-trained. Mr. Fu, what are you doing here? Mr. Yamazaki. Please, let me join you. - To go where? - I am just joining you. Mr. Fu, I have no time to hang out with you today. I have things to do. I know. That's why I am asking. Do you understand what I am saying? Yes. - I have no time to joke around. - I am serious. I am going to get angry. I am serious. Let's go. This is not for a novice like you. Get out. I want to give you a hand. That's all. Shit. Whatever. What are you guys up to? What about you? Why don't you mind your own business? Stop changing the subject. Where are you going? That's not your business. Answer now. If you don't want it here, you will have to talk in more detail somewhere else. I am going for a drive. Two guys in the night? That sounds disturbing. Are you two gay? What else do you need? Please, let me go. I can't. You have to talkwith us for a while today. Whatever. Ah, this is weird. Hey! Speed up! I can't! You can't? Did they give up? Yes! Bring one more police car here! Immediately! Huh? I am Fukuoka from Dept. No. 4! I mean a police car! Mr. Fu. You don't seem scared of anything, including signals and cops. You must have no siblings or family. I am not scared of death either. I used to think so though. Hello. Long time no see. Nice to see you. Long time no see. - How's your boss doing? - He still loves soft serve ice cream. My girlfriend loves it too. I haven't seen him before. He is my new assistant. Please, be nice to him. I guess your clan is changing its tactics around Shinjuku. He looks like a novice, but he has proved his capabilities in our clan. Have you ridden the Tokyo-Bay Water Bus recently? No. Let's try again together later. Whenever we are available. See you. Hey! What are you doing here? Aren't you a yakuza? I am not scared of you. Have you done some transactions here? Yakuza often do that kind of stuff, right? Give me some money. Okay, let's be civilized. We don't need much. I said: "Let's be civilized". I would recommend you to move over. Move over what? Do we look like high-school kids to you? Okay, I get it. Get this and move over. How dare you? Are you alright? I thought we were close, Yamazaki. Thank you. If you excuse me now. Michio. Yes? Don't move until the time comes. Mr. Fu? Mr. Fu, I must thank you. It's nothing. Sorry for making you do this. Doesn't it look cool? Mr. Fukuoka! Mr. Fukuoka! Let's start, shall we? Where did the transaction take place? - What are you talking about? - You know what! The drugs. Is this a joke? Who was the buyer? Where did you hide them? Technically, I am a witness, but this is like an interrogation. Perhaps. I don't expect much from you. Your partner might provide something more. Hey, I will make the sanction as small as possible for you. Start talking about everything that happened last night. I know you have amnesia... ...but you must remember things that happened today and yesterday. Huh? The right to remain silent? You are an experienced yakuza. Why did you make such a stupid blunder? Why did you hire a guy with no background like him? Had he actually had amnesia, he would be just a retard, wouldn't he? He is going to confess soon. Your clan must have been struggling so much. Or maybe that's not the case. If his real identity is revealed... ...it might become an even bigger problem. Either way, you cannot go back to your clan! What do you mean by "his real identity"? You haven't suspected him at all? You are naive! Whatever he is, he just has amnesia. That's all. Of course. That's why. Hey! Hey! Towel! It seems he started to talk. Why don't you start too? You have to talk now before he tells us everything. Otherwise, you will have a hard time with the prosecutors. Your girlfriend is a florist, isn't she? She seems like a good girl. Don't make her cry. I will kill you! How dare you, you bastard?! That's enough. Go home. Hey! Turn left at the intersection. Huh? Get to the park. But the Boss told me to bring you two. - Shut up and go! - Yes! Mr. Fu. You'd better leave this town. There must be somewhere else you can actually reside peacefully. I brought you only trouble. No. Take care, then. Excuse me. - Is that fine, Bro? - Shut up! He is a great man. He lives in a world different from ours. - The Boss will be irate! - I don't care! I'm not going back to the clan either! Huh? Damn it. I can't just swallow it... ...without killing their boss. How dare they?! That idiot. I had a bad feeling at that time. Bring Michio right now. He said... ...that he doesn't care about the clan anymore. How about the kid I ordered to pick up Michio? He... ...followed Michio. Did you just watch it happen... ... without doing anything? Hey, aren't you lkehiro? Wait! Now you remember, don't you? You were an injured warrior... ...at a place 1 0 km away from a battlefield. In the field hospital... ... when your body temperature became 0 °C... ...you were reborn as a new creature. How about you? I am the same. The vital energy has been hidden... ...deep inside your memories for a long time. What do you think? It brings up memories, doesn't it? This is my turf starting tonight. Destroy Michio! What's going on? Wait there! Calm down! Hey! Yamazaki! You have suffered so much for choosing the wrong boyfriend. A florist girlfriend for a yakuza? You cannot become a normal couple... ...however hard you try. You cannot ever properly divorce nor leave a yakuza either. That's why you cannot become a normal couple. - Hey! Get the phone! - Yes. If it's Michio, tell him I am going to change the time. Yes! Hello? It's lzawa. Has Michio called you? No... but... What is it? That guy is back! - Bring him to the bar. - Yes. I can see why Michio talked highly of you. You are not restrained at all. He likes that kind of thing. But I cannot allow him. If I let him, the clan will collapse eventually. Hey! You have to take responsibility. I heard that you have guts. The Kuroi Clan, with which you had a transaction, called me earlier. If you take care of Michio... ...you can have fun in our turf as much as you want. If you ever touch Mr. Yamazaki... ... I will hammer your body into pieces! Mr. Fu. In the beginning, Michio also used to look at me from outside like that. Once he makes up his mind... ...he will forget about me. He wants to become like you. He will come backto you. Both of you can become like the wind in the end. He will definitely come back. I will be waiting here then. Always. In the early morning, in Shinjuku, Tokyo, where a yakuza war... ...has been taking place recently, Shinji Nagao, the boss of the Asahi Clan, was shot. He was immediately transported to a nearby hospital, but he is unconscious at the moment. According to a witness, ... the shooter was identified as Michio Yamazaki, 25... ...a member of the Oshima Clan, the rival of the Asahi Clan. This incident appears to be a retaliation attempt for the murder... ...of Eiichi Oshima, the boss of the Oshima Clan, which happened last month. Therefore, the metropolitan police investigation team cordoned off the offices... ... of the Asahi Clan and the Oshima Clan, and dispatched officers... ... and swat teams to thoroughly search the premises. Mr. Fu. Mr. Yamazaki. Who the fuck are you? Mr. Fu. Miss Chika. Mr. Yamazaki hasn't died yet.
