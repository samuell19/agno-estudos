Man: Hello there. I'm your guide and you're playing "You Don't Know Jack." And I need to know how many contestants we have. Okay, sleepy, let's try that again. How many people are playing the game? I'm sorry, was I talking too quiet for you? ( shouts ) How many people are playing the game? So, you're all alone playing with yourself, huh? God, I hate this stupid game. ( sighs ) - Morning, Garnet! - Morning yourself. She's been up all night again. Mike Senior's gonna wanna know. Woman: Why don't you call him at the ranch? -( low growling ) - Man: Keith. Aw, come on, Mike. Garnet's busy doctoring. She asked me to feed the bull just this once. Keith, uh-uh. ( sighs ) Why you wanna make her come all the way out here to feed that bull is beyond me. I want her to come out here so I can keep an eye on her. - See how she's doing. - ( bull moos ) I figured, well, if she starts working 80 hours a week, she'd work Mike off her mind. - Mike: That's what I wanted. - Keith: Oh, jeez. Oop! Ah! Get away! Ow! Oop! - ( Mike chuckles ) - ( Keith mutters ) ( horse whinnies ) Mike: How long's it been since you saw Garnet laugh? I don't know. I figured she bought that bull and she'd shoot it. That seemed natural to me. Well, buyin' that bull that busted his head don't seem natural to me. Well, that's because you're an ignorant savage, you see? That's psychology. Keith: You call keeping the bull that killed your son psychology? Now here's what I want you to do. I want you to get on the telephone, call Garnet up. Tell her to come out here and feed her own bull. That's not gonna cut no ice with Garnet. You're gonna have to be happy bossing everybody else - in the county around. - Now, she's my family and I love her and I don't want to see her to suffer anymore. Well, if you wouldn't make her haul out here every night to feed that hay burner, maybe she'd have time to find herself another man. She don't want another man. She just growls at 'em and they run off. I've gotta find some way to make one of them stand and fight, but how do I do that? Well, why don't you give them some horses or something, 'cause that's what I think "ignorant savages" would do. Horses. That's the dumbest idea I ever heard in my life. They told me you were back in town, Marshal. I swore I wouldn't come. I heard that there were knife wounds. - Here and here. - They got better. Only because the ancient Blackfoot medicine man pressed his magic talisman to the wounds. - Hmm. Breathe. - ( boy pants ) "Hunda-hunda," breathe. I know I can't hold you, Marshal. I know your job comes first. - But can I ask one thing from you? - What's that? Would you pee in this cup? - Hmm. - ( chuckles ) Hey, Ed, Sarah. Oh, I wear it so a little boy who comes all the way from Green River will let me doctor him. - He prefers saloon girls to doctors. - Who doesn't? So, if you're a doctor you can wear saloon dresses - or space suits or whatever? - Yeah. Of course, when you do, good-for-nothings like Jimmy Rawlinbow will stake out your office looking for cheap thrills. Saw him on the way in here. Yeah. I don't know who's more dangerous-- healthy guys who play at being sick or sick guys who play at being healthy. I took the stuff and I got better. You're sick and out of work and Wynette is holding down two jobs. I can give you the medicine. Can't do that. They send me samples, Eddie. Free samples. They're rotting in my cabinet. I pay my own way. If you wanna be macho instead of healthy, I'm gonna come down on you so hard. ( chuckles ) Whoa! If you're gonna kill yourself being a man, maybe you'd better think about the people that love you first. Sarah, darlin', will you get Dr. Garnet a drink there? Okay. It's okay. You cry if you need to. Crying's not going to bring Michael back. ( sighs ) Could you take this down to Arnel's, have the prescription filled, and then drop it by Ed Pullman's place on the way home? Why not call it in and have them deliver? Because I need to make it look like a free sample from the office. I'd do it myself, but I gotta go to the ranch. Don't even start about that crazy business. - Please. - Okay. Jimmy Rawlinbow is the only one left in the waiting room. Do you want me to send him in? Not really. Hello there, Jimmy. - You're gettin' to be kind of a regular here. - Yeah. Would you wear that saloon girl outfit for me? No, not even if you had to crawl five miles on broken glass to get here. I'd consider it. What's the problem? Well, I was helping Tommy B. move yesterday. There was a lot of heavy lifting. Oh, not the hernia again. Jimmy, we've been down this road before. I'm not impressed. ( groans ) All right, let's get it over with. - Still not impressed? - Oh, stop it, Jimmy. I can't help it. It's an involuntary reaction. You're the doctor, you take care of it. All righty, then. ( snaps ) - ( thumps ) - Oh! Good. Now turn your head and cough. - ( shudders ) - No, no, no. Cough. - ( coughs weakly ) - Much better. - Hi. - Hey. Now I'm gonna say something to you that you're not gonna much like. But it's the truth. It needs to be said and I'm gonna say it. - Are you listenin'? - Mm-hmm. You know how much Michael meant to me. After my Ria passed away, he was the only family I had till you came along. I love you, too, Pop. But watching you mope around miserable every day is just too hard to see. I got a hole in my heart. Well, then you better fill it, because I can't take this anymore. Oh, you can't? Well, I'm just as sorry as hell for you, Pop. Now that's not what I meant and you know it. Sure, you did. You want to reduce my personal grief to your not having your own way. Well, if seeing me sad depresses you, then you don't have to see me anymore. Oh, hell. Hey, Cuddles. ( snorts ) Let's make friends. Come on, you bastard. Let's play tag. Hey! What are you doin' in there? ( grunts ) Look, having you gone is a whole lot worse than having you sad. Why don't you say we cut a deal? What kind of deal? If you'll show up at every event at next week's Centennial with an eligible male, I'll feed your dadgum bull for a year. ( huffs ) ( phone rings ) Aren't any of us really sick. Mike called a bunch of us. Rosie said you're looking for dates for every day of the Centennial? There's bound to be lots of men asking. You're a pretty lady. - And what was Mike's offer? - Land. The Five Corners section down at the river bottom. But that ain't it. You know I had a crush on you since 6th grade? Ahem. She's got a real nice energy. Good grazin' land, too. ( sighs ) Can you believe it? He posted a dowry on me. That old goat put a bounty on my pelt. ( sighs ) So, he wants me to get a man. Okay, fine. I'll get a man. But I'm going to own him. - I'll see ya, all right? - Take it easy. See you next week. Woman: Bryan Jemsen, I've got something here you're really going to like. Oh! Sweaty! I gave the recording of your symphony to a Hollywood agent I know. He listened, he liked, he says he can get you a lot of work doing movies and TV. ( laughs ) - Movies and television? - Yeah. - Well, that would be great! - ( giggles ) - How can I thank you? - Come back to L.A. with me. Jenny, you're one of my most favorite people in the whole world, you know that. But I'm not sure if I can-- If you really love me, that's okay. This is how you find out. After we've lived together for a while, you'll know. You won't be sponging off me, Bryan. Besides, think of all the fun we have together. You like it. You know you do. ( plays melody ) You drove 250 miles for this? Jill, a professional escort is exactly what I need. And I thought you didn't approve of my line of work. Jill, I don't want a romance. I just want an employee. How about George here? He's very, um... talented. Um, do you have someone with just a few wrinkles? Mario. There. He's almost 28 and he's well packaged. - ( phone rings ) - Jill: Yeah. No, you're supposed to be booked tomorrow night at 7:00, not tonight. Sorry. You know, when I used to call Michael at the ranch, he would always have this way of knowing that it was me. So when I'd call, he'd answer the phone with, "Hi, hon'," without me saying a word. And sometimes I would catch him watching me when I'd be looking at a... you know, a sunset or a baby. I mean, something profoundly beautiful. And he would rather watch me. Do you know how that makes you feel? ( chuckles, sighs ) I mean, how could you forget something like that? I can't. And I won't. He sounds pretty wonderful. Yeah. He was perfect. You know... I just may have a guy for you. Tell me again why I should do this. Because you love your little sister? I'm hurtin' financially here, okay? - I really need the commission. - Use someone else. You're what she needs. You fit the bill. - I told you. I don't have anyone else. - I don't know how to do this. I'm not gonna take that lady's money. You don't have to. I'll take her money. Bryan, Mom's therapy costs and this could help. - Besides, it'd be good for you. - Good for me? What you need is to stop, Bryan, and really think about what you're doing. You write music that will get heard someday with or without Virginia. Jenny said the same thing. Oh, she's good. Please? It's the right thing to do. This is the doctor who helped Mom. I like her. I wanna help her. And how long are we talking about? - Just a week. - Five days? A week... of sanctuary where you can take a deep breath and think about what you're doing. What if somebody up there figures out she's buying the service? - Look, there's no sex, okay? - Damn right there's no sex. Worst that can happen, you blow our scam. Of course, you don't want her to find out that you're my brother. That would really be embarrassing. All she wants is control of her life. Well, control isn't everything that it's cracked up to be. Oh, it's okay for Virginia, but not for the doctor? Come on. What she wants is for you to help her have some fun. If I do this, you're gonna owe me. Maybe. Maybe not. ( sighs ) Car troubles? Yeah, it's blockin' my view. Older man: Pretty this time of the year, ain't it? Hey, do you know where Garnet Hadley's place is? Well, now, there, then it's clear across the other side of town. Now you could go down here-- well, no, just go down the street here and turn left and go about two blocks and then turn right and go about three more blocks, down Lincoln Avenue, and then when you get to Franklin, turn left. Come up to a big, large poplar tree and it's about two blocks past that. Okay, thank you. I'll leave my car here, okay? Sure. - Okay. - Thanks, Garnet. He cut his hair with the safety scissors and then while I'm cleaning up the hair, he eats the whole bottle of orange baby aspirin. Yeah, well, he must have been very depressed - about his haircut. - ( chuckles ) - Bye. - Bye. Oh, gentlemen, howdy. Everyone, I have an announcement to make. My boyfriend from Denver will be arriving here this afternoon. - Receptionist: He's here. - He's what? Jacob Barnes told Barbie Spencer that a guy with Colorado plates was asking for you - over on Schilling. - He's here. I gotta go find him. Hey, Becky! Christine! Have you seen a new guy wandering around here? - Girl: No. - No? Where is this guy? ( sighs ) ( birds chirping ) Excuse me? Excuse me? Are you all right? I'm a doctor. Are you "the" doctor? Uh, yeah. You must be the-- uh-- wait a second. What are you doing here lying on your back? I was arranging some clouds. Pardon me? Well, my dad taught me. He said if you lay flat on the ground and use the Earth's power that you can push the clouds around with your mind. ( chuckles ) And does it work? Well, yeah, if you're patient. It usually does. But you tell me. Bryan: What do you think? How am I doing? Okay, okay. Um... why didn't you come to me directly? I-- I mean, what have you been doing wandering around here for the last three hours? How did you know when I got to town? Well, you met Mr. Barnes at about 10 after 1:00 when you came into town, who told Jan Hunt you were looking for me, who then told Meg Spencer, who called my receptionist. - That's amazing. - Yeah, well, that's life in Sweetwater. Come on. I mean, if you let one word slip around here, I mean, this whole thing could fall apart. What whole thing? Hasn't your boss briefed you? Well, she said that we're supposed to be lovers, but that we'd work out the details here. I don't get this. I mean, you're very pretty. Okay, stop. Save it for the public when we've got someone to sell. ( engine starts ) So what exactly are we selling? We've been lovers for the last six months. We will inevitably marry and live happily ever after. Bryan: Okay. Why do we want them to believe that? No, no, no, no. There is no "we." Why I want them to believe, that is my business. Now, come on. - Kiss me. - Hmm? - Oh. - No, kiss me. Neighbors. Don't look. Kiss me. - ( splatters ) - Oh! - Not bad. - Thanks. Now, take me into the house and make it look like you love me - and that you've missed me. - Okay. Oh--! Bryan: Let me get the door for you. Ahem. So, Jill told me this odd little story. I thought maybe you might help me understand. Okay, fair enough. Look, I'm a little nervous here. This is all very new to me. Yeah, yeah. Why am I here? I mean, Mrs. Bray down at the Food Mart says you're the prize catch in town. You were talking to Muriel Bray? If you were asking about me, then she's gonna know that we're not involved. I mean, Dan Rather doesn't reach as many people in Sweetwater - as Muriel Bray. - Calm down. Calm down. I mean, we wowed the neighbors. They think we're in love. I mean, I know what to do, I just wondered why. Tomorrow my husband will have been dead two years. I can't forget him. Even if I am "the prize catch in town." Sorry, that must be tough. Thank you. I think you mean that. Anyway, people around here won't give me a break. I mean, they feel that I have exceeded the socially acceptable mourning period. Like there is such a thing. Right. Exactly right. Oh, gosh. It's nice to finally meet somebody who understands. Well, I didn't say I understood. I mean, isn't it possible to love the man you lost and somebody else, too? Nobody could ever replace Michael. Well, it's possible that you can love more than one person at a time. Really? Well, you don't even know me. Well, I know how you kiss. Yeah, well, that was nothing. You should see how I kiss people that I like. Tell me about it. I have to pretend to enjoy kissing some very bossy, mean-tempered women. - ( knocking ) - Come here. Come here! - Wha-wha-wha--? - Come in! Oh! Oh, Pop, hi. I just wanted to be sure that you didn't think that I was being unfaithful to Michael's memory. But when you sent every bachelor in the county to court me, well, I knew you were serious. And because I know this relationship is really the one for me, I felt it was okay now for you to know about Bryan. - Hi. - Hey. - You know... - Yeah? this ain't half bad. I never have been an omelet man myself, but this is all right. Reckon you can rustle me up another one? Uh... actually, no. I used the last of the butter and onions and bacon. I mean, I can try it with grapes and popcorn, but I don't think it'll be the same. That's funny. Well, you're more surefooted in the kitchen than Garnet here. Well, yeah, sure, 'cause Bryan worked-- you cooked in a kitchen, didn't you? Uh... well, kitchened in the place for a while. Oh, is that a fact? Place, huh? What place was that? A place called The Brownstone in Denver. Right, right. Brownstone. Brownstone. Any reason you wanna know? Oh, I might wanna pay 'em a visit. And why is that? Garnet and I had a little talk last week and a talk that would have included you if you'd been for real. How long you two supposed to have been together? Six months. You remember those twice-a-month visits to the clinic in Denver. Well, geriatrics weren't the only ones I was seeing. If you've known him longer than yesterday, I'll smile and kiss a pig. Well, you just pucker up, Pop. You're the one who wanted me to get a guy, remember? Well, I got a guy. - That is not your guy. - Oh, yes, he is. Although, by the looks of him, I expect he'd warm to the idea. Now I wanna know what's goin' on here. I-- I-- look, I know this comes as kind of a shock to you, sir, but you're really making more of this than is necessary. Look, son, I'm trying to talk to my girl. Do you wanna step out of the way? No, I don't believe I do. She's actually got you convinced that you're helping her, doesn't she? Let me tell you something. You're not helping her. She's a big girl. She can make up her own mind. You don't wanna get in my way, son. If I have to go through you, I'm gonna leave one hellacious hole. Hey, hey, hey, hey, Pop. You be careful how you talk to him. We could be a family soon. Family? I-- I'm your family. Okay. Fine, then. You can do the dishes. We're gonna go to bed. You want me to do the dishes? Well, sure, I'll do the dishes. - Ah! - There. They're done. I may be uneducated, but I do learn real quick. One thing I'm gonna learn is what the two of you are up to. You kids have a good night. ( door closes ) So, you think he bought it? Yeah. I think the stain is permanent. I really liked this sweater, too. Hey, where did you get that shirt? In the dryer. Just be careful with it. Sure. ( classical piano music playing ) You're kidding. You went to Georgetown? Yeah, that's actually how I met Jill till she dropped out and went into your business. Then I did my residency at Johns Hopkins, second in my class. Well, you could practice anywhere in the world. What are you doing here? I like it here. Before I was here, people had to drive all the way to Jackson. So it's a humanitarian thing? Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm a saint. Don't you think we ought to get to know each other a little? No. That's the whole idea. No, not out of any real attraction. We're supposed to be engaged. We don't even know squat about each other. And your father-in-law saw right through you. I'm sure that you're a highly competent professional... - Prostitute? - All right, if you prefer. My point is that there are things within your realm of expertise that I will need. And there are things that I won't. You're not exactly a social scientist, okay? But they all agree I've got great lateral mobility. Oh, I bet they do. But I am deliberately trying to avoid familiarity. I hired you so that there would be no danger of your getting emotionally involved. Danger with you? I appreciate your confidence. I'm sure you're used to just bowling them over with brains and sophistication out here in the sticks. - You're not even a bad-looking woman. - Thank you. I have actually noticed you watching me when I wasn't looking. I was making a professional assessment. And it's not like I've never seen better. Just because I'm not the most beautiful woman you've ever been with doesn't mean you still may not want me. Me want you? Please. I do believe that I can contain myself. - Come here. - Why? I wanna show you something. - Come here. - ( sighs ) - Just stand. - What are you doing? Just stand there. Watch. Hey, watch it, buster! Hey, I'm a professional, remember? Just watch. Put your mind at ease. So what do you say, boss? Are you still worried about my professionalism? No. So where do I sleep? Oh, guest room, third floor. - Good night, then. - Good night. ( exhales ) ( yawns ) Okay. All right. I need your advice on a little matter. I've got to travel down to Denver on some very important business tomorrow. You can't do that, Mike. It's the Centennial. Yeah, I know, but like I told you, it's very important. Either I've gotta go or I gotta send somebody I can trust. Come on, Mike, you know I'd milk a bull for you, but I've been looking forward to this all year. Roping team needs me and I got a date. About Garnet. ( moans ) Good man, Keith. Look, this is what I need you to do. This has gotta stay between you and me. ( faint dog barking ) Uh... ( knocking ) Hey. Oh, hi. Something-- Do you ever just sleep with people? What? I mean, do you ever... hold somebody without sex? Just sleep with them? I do whatever I'm told, boss. You know that. Well, I thought that it might help when I'm trying to convince people that we're-- - you know. - Well, it's a good idea. I was wondering what might happen if your father-in-law was watching the house. Right, right. Yeah, I mean, you know, I said we were lovers and there have been lights on on both floors of the house. Well, that's okay. Just tell him we had a spat. That I thought he was a jerk and you stuck up for him. Right, oh, yeah. That'd be great. He'd buy that. Boy, you really are good at this. I am a professional. Can I ask you to do one more thing for me? Would you put this on? I never wear shirts to bed. I would really appreciate it if you could wear this. Is that a problem? Is that what Michael wore? What if it was? Think that would be some big hairy social perversion? Like social perversions aren't your bread and butter. I'm a doctor. What are you? I'm an-- An employee. Delicately put. Look, um, you're right. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. I wasn't really awake. I... I can do this for you. I can. Is this okay? ( sighs ) ( sighs ) I'm-- I'm sorry, Jill. I mean, it's just getting outta hand. Things are getting seriously weird and I don't think I'm doing her any good. Well, I'm getting really uncomfortable. Oh, no, no. Don't guilt trip me. Okay, no, I-- look, I'll find some money for Mom. I'll work in a gas station. Well, commission or no commission. Look, I-- I don't think I can keep this up. - I gotta go. - ( beeps ) - Morning. - Oh, morning. - Coffee? - Oh, thanks. - I wanted to talk about last night. - Last night. - Yeah, me, too. - Yeah. It was wonderful. What? Well, it was the first good night's sleep that I've had in two years. And I'm grateful to you for that. It was nothing really. I mean, I-- No, it was a lot. You've been really patient under the circumstances. I know I've given you a lot of attitude and you're still here. So I promise not to be such a pain in the-- you know-- anymore. Can you do that? ( laughs ) Try me. Sorry. Fact is-- Gosh, I'm feeling, like, this primal feminine urge like I should cook for you or something, except that my cooking stinks. So how about we go to the Centennial picnic and we can sample some of Sweetwater's best? Well, my clothes are still in my car. Oh, I've got a houseful of clothes. Michael's clothes. It won't bother me. Well, let's get going. I wanna show you off. Okay. Hey, big guy. Ride 'em there, cowboy. That's it. Hey, Doc, how are you? - Garnet: Whoa! - Man: Nice-lookin' fella, huh? - Man: Garnet. - Howdy. This is great. Say, I can't remember the last time I had homemade ice cream. No, I mean us. We look great together. People are really believing us. - Yeah, I hope so. - It's working. I just spoke to the restaurant in Denver last night. They said you were there less than a month. Well, I got a better offer. That's life. Mm-hmm. The manager knew where you worked before and where you worked after. That's three jobs at least. You don't seem to have much stayin' power. Isn't it time for the mayor's speech? Oh, they won't start without us. - Who is this guy, anyway? - My boyfriend. What if he has the same attitude toward women he has toward work-- something better comes along, he'd just leave? Sir, women and jobs are kind of alike. You find the right one, devotion's never even an issue. Oh, that's so sweet. You know, I like you better as a dish rag than as a philosopher. Hey, he was trying to offer a polite response to an insult, you moron. If I were a man, I would have knocked you down. If you had a man, you wouldn't have to. Well, maybe we can just settle this girl-to-girl. Garnet: Huh! You asked for it, son. Now you gonna get it. Come on. You know me, I'm sorry, I just lost my temper. - Do you want me to stop this? - No, I want him to stop this. This isn't part of the job description. Now use your reach and keep moving. And here I was working so hard to convince you I was polite. Don't worry about it. Yeah, you hit like a girl. ( grunts ) All right, look, I'm sorry. You punch pretty good for an old guy. That's not much of a compliment coming from a man that can't punch at all. Oh, yeah? Well, hang on. I'll try and make it significant. Oh! Well, that's not bad, son, but I'm gonna have to drop you now. I've gotta make a speech on community brotherhood. - You're the mayor? - Yep. Great. Sorry. Ooh--! Oh, this is great! ( gasps ) I've got responsibilities. Excuse me. - ( squeals ) - ( crowd applauds ) Wasn't he great? Wasn't he? - That was great. - ( crowd applauds ) - Mike: Sweetwater is a town... - Man: Nice fight. - Thanks. - ...where every man is your neighbor. So if you can't hide from him in a crowd, you'd better get to know him by any means possible. ( applause ) Garnet: So if you look at the sky and you're patient, you can move the clouds where you want them to? Patience is a big part of it. Faith is more important. You know, at first I thought you were kidding. But now it doesn't matter. I think it's wonderful. You know, I've seen the Bolshoi and I've looked at a wall full of Monets, and I have been two feet from the crown jewels, but never in my life have I seen the likes of your right uppercut that knocked the bluster out of Mike Hadley. ( chuckles ) That was pretty funny what you said about devotion. I mean, of course, he didn't get it, but knowing what your job is, it was pretty funny. So is this the job you're devoted to? Could be. Do you always comb your hair before bed? You busted me. Glad you came up. Didn't realize how much I've missed lying in someone's arms at night. Proud to serve. Every inch the professional. Oh, oh, here. Are we still sure about every inch... of being professional? I haven't had any complaints. Lucky you. We had fun today, didn't we? Yeah, we did. I really like you, but I still don't want to do anything but just sleep together. I mean, are you up for that? - Is that still okay with you? - Sure. - It is? - Yeah. Good. Boy, this is a-- it's been a treat not having to perform sexually every 10 minutes. - Every 10? - Well, every 20. Kinda like a vacation. Well, I can't tell you how much I appreciate it. Are you okay? You're gonna have to excuse me for a moment. Ahem. You know, there's really not a lot of guys - who could do this sort of thing. - ( water pattering ) I'm gaining a real appreciation for your profession. Anything I can do to help out. ( giggles ) ( classical music playing ) ( applause ) That was great! It was great. Do you know how tough that piece is? They have some real musicians in this town. Yeah, I like baroque, but I really prefer Russian. Especially Tchaikovsky. "Peter and the Wolf" is my favorite. You know, I could teach you about music. Prokofiev. Excuse me? Prokofiev, he wrote "Peter and the Wolf." And Tchaikovsky isn't really considered very Russian. Tchaikovsky isn't Russian? Well, he was mostly aping the Germans and the Italians of the time. Rimsky-Korsakov and Mussorgsky are considered the real Russian-sounding guys. Well, we are full of surprises, aren't we? Oh, that depends. Do we like surprises? Oh, we have always loved surprises. ( country music playing ) Well, you may know a little something about music, but the real question is can you dance? ( music ends ) ( sighs ) Mike: Come to give me another shot at the championship? I've had enough. If you wanna hit me again, you're gonna have to catch me. ( chuckles ) No, son, I don't chase trouble. You know, I know there's some kind of a scam playing here, but I don't know what it is. But you made my Garnet laugh again. For that, I'm grateful. You don't wanna tell me what this is all about? It's true love, sir. You know, I'm supposed to set up a picnic at some stock pond, but I got lost. - She wanted you to go to the stock pond? - Yes, sir. That's where Michael proposed. - ( bull grunts ) - Jeez! - ( Mike laughs ) - That is one big-- How do you know when he's gonna stop? Oh, I know that brute better than any of the rest of them on this ranch. She didn't tell you about him? No, why would she? Well, sir, unlike some folks, I believe a man can be more useful the more information he's got. I like to be useful. Let me tell you a little story. My son used to ride bulls. He rode that one... once. ( snorts ) ( quacking ) - Bryan: Hey. - Hey. I thought you were gonna get here first and set up. Did you get lost? Yeah, I ended up at the main house, - bumped into Mike. - Oh. Was he hard on you? No, he's rough, but he's not mean. He sure loves you. This really is a beautiful spot. I feel really comfortable here with you. Do you come here often? You know, you have been really great. I mean, this whole thing has turned out... so well. I was just wondering if there was something I could do for you? Hmm. You could teach me some more about music? - Jerk. - ( laughs ) So is that what you really want to be? A musician? Well, I do love to play, yeah, but composing-- I mean, the rush you get creating music, it's the closest a man can come to creating life. With a piece of paper and your imagination, you can touch people with a part of your soul and hearing it, they somehow recognize themselves. Or at least that's what the guys on the MTV interview say. - Yeah, right. - Oh! Oh! What's the matter? Did I hurt you? It's just a bruise from the fight. Well, listen, my secure area of competence - is medicine, so-- - No, it's okay. Look, why didn't you tell me? You could have cracked a rib. You know, I think I've thought of something you can do for me. Oh, yeah? What? ( playing softly ) What is that you're playing? It's beautiful. Did you write this? For you. ( music ends ) No, thank you. I like to know what's really happening. Okay. I think you'll like it. Relax. Leave everything to me. - I don't wear cologne. - Yeah, but I nicked you and this will disinfect it. Ah. Ouch. One more thing. Can you crack my back? Yes, I can. Can you turn around? All right, cross your arms. Take a deep breath. Blow it out and drop your head. Ooh! Thank you. Now go to bed. Go on. Are you sure you want me here in your room? Yes. Leave the light on. I wanna see you. You're beautiful. I'll be more beautiful in the moonlight. Moonlight is romantic. It's kind. What's wrong? I think I'm falling in love with you. ( switch clicks ) Then kiss me. Keith! Where the hell are you? Keith! Keith, what did you find out? Why didn't you wake me up? Courtesy, Mike. Good friends don't wake up good friends when good friends are asleep. A good friend don't wake up a good friend when he's awake. It's a waste of energy. Well, you got me there, partner. I'll contemplate that. Come on, Keith, this is important. I think Garnet really likes this guy. The whole town likes him. Hell, I might even like him a little bit myself. Well, everybody in Denver likes him, too. He's had nine jobs in two years and nobody said a bad word against him. Well, that's good. Not really. She slickered you, Mike. She pulled a fast one. Slickered me? Who pulled a fast one? Garnet, who else? She hired him. Hired him to do what? Oh-- his sister works for an escort agency. And his landlady said that he's taken up with some high-toned L.A. woman to go out and make movies. Now goodbye. - He's got a girl in L.A.? - ( Keith moans ) ( mutters ) Got a girl in L.A. We'll see about this. A man comes in here and thinks he can fool everybody... ( mutters ) ...think about that. - ( gunshot blasts ) - ( screams ) You nuts? You know I don't like guns! My whole family don't like guns! They're loud! - What's the matter with you? - Good mornin', glory. Now that I got your attention, I want all the details. ( birds chirping, faint cooing ) Morning. Hi. What are you doin' up? It's vaccination day out on the reservation. I've got children to stab. - Oh. - Wanna come along? No, I bit a doctor once for vaccinating-- my kid sister. - Recently? - Nope, it was way last year. Well, how about hanging around the house and I'll meet you back here at around 5:00? Don't wanna miss the dance. Um, Garnet! I, uh... I need to tell you something. I... I-I don't know what it is about this place or about you, but I feel differently than I ever felt before. I hope that's a compliment. Were you making love to me last night? You couldn't tell? Oh, gosh, I knew I was a little rusty, but-- I'm in love with you. Are you sure that's not going just a little beyond your professional border? We need to talk about that, too. But first, I need to know how you feel. I feel wonderful. I'm really grateful. More than that, I'm glad that you're here. Well, does the word "love" come in here at all? Oh, I think that word gets abused a lot. But I-- I do have feelings for you. Yeah, I could be falling for you. I am falling for you... despite your occupation. So this doesn't have to end after tomorrow? Oh, um, you'll find that I don't like letting go of a good thing. So you don't mind if I stick around? I'd like that. ( door opens, closes ) Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah, come on! I want the truth and I want it right now. What the hell is this? I love Garnet. I don't know if she loves me. This is how I'm gonna find out. By gettin' rid of my son's things? I'm not gonna stand by and let you put my son on a trash heap. The right thing to do is to bury your son. She can't do it, so I am. You are? Well, I know about you. She hired you from one of those escort services. That's not exactly right. But what is true is that I love her. I can make her happy. Isn't that what you want? Maybe you're afraid to see her with another man. You just watch your step there, boy. I can still kick your butt. You could do that. Or you could help me take these things outta here. It needs to be done. You think so, huh? Michael was in great form that day. Must have been quite a guy, your son. ( softly ) Yeah. ( sighs ) Well, I guess this would look pretty silly on another guy's mantelpiece. If you do her wrong, I'm gonna be all over you like ugly on an emu. Okay. Damn! ( thumps ) ( sniffles ) Let's get this stuff in my truck, take it out to the ranch. Come on. ( door opens ) Excuse me? - Hi. - Hi. I'm looking for the man who drives that car. Oh, you just missed him. He took off here a moment ago with Mike Hadley. Oh, is he staying here with Mr. Hadley? Oh, no, no. He's staying with Garnet. That's Mike's daughter-in-law. - Oh, my. - Oh, my, indeed. I don't know where they went, but you can wait here for them if you want, or they'll be at the dance this afternoon. - The dance? - Yeah. Why don't you tell me about the dance? Hey! Sorry I'm late. Robbie Windsong bet Darpine Lewis that he could kick a cactus so fast that it wouldn't stick. Robbie's out a quarter. - Bryan: Is that for me? - Garnet: It's a dreamcatcher. We better get to the dance by 6:00. Next to the spring stock auctions, this is the social event of the season. Everybody will be there. And if we're late, all the food will be gone. ( playing softly ) ( music continues ) ( slams ) What have you done with my things? - They're not here anymore. - They belong to me. You have no right to touch them, let alone move them anywhere. Where is everything? It's gone, Garnet. But I'm here. Get away from me. Where did you put my things? You mean Michael's things? You dress me up in Michael's clothes, you make me smell like him and you make love to me in the dark. You want me to be Michael, but I can't be him. Yeah, well, you got that right. Michael's gone. Let that end and start something new. It won't be the same, but it could work. Well, I'm not gonna love and lose again. - I loved Michael and he died. - Anybody can die. Yeah, well, I'm not gonna let that happen to me. Will you listen to yourself? You're supposed to be a doctor. And you're supposed to be a whore. - I'm no whore. - Oh, did we touch a nerve? - Listen to me... - Well, I don't think someone like you - could even conceive of what you're doing. - I'm not an escort. That's not what I do. I'm a composer. - Oh, is that what you call it? - I'm Jill's brother. You're what? ( sighs ) I was doing her a favor. Favor? So this whole thing has been one big lie? No, it hasn't been a lie. Do you two do this sort of thing often? She wanted you to have the best. Oh, "the best"?! You are so arrogant. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't tell you earlier, all right? I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I wanted to a number of times. Yeah, so why didn't you? I guess I started to like the job. If you want, I'll leave now. - I mean, if that's what you want. - Uh-uh. No. You have two hours with me at the Bison Ball. I don't care if I see you at the dance, but you take me there and you bring me home. So no one can get near you, huh? We had a deal. I paid my dime. You finish the dance. You're gonna throw everything away with or without me. Yeah, well, I guess you're the expert at throwing things away. I didn't throw anything away that would keep you from being happy tomorrow. Neither did I. ( footsteps fade ) ( door slams ) ( slams ) ( slams ) ( music playing ) - Hello, sweetheart. - Hi. - How you doin'? - Just great, Pop. How are you? What did you think about the housecleanin'? It was the right thing to do. I helped him move the boxes. Well, I hope you two feel really good about yourselves. Excuse me. - Judy, can I borrow your man? - Sure. I've lost her, Mike. Had to be done. Now she'll heal. Not for me. Hello, Bryan. Jenny. What are you doin' here? Looking for you. Wasn't easy. Jillian wouldn't tell me where you went or why. I got worried when you didn't return my calls. How did you find me? Your landlady told me. You told her when you cancelled some kind of Sunday dinner date with her? Well, you don't seem very pleased to see me. As a matter of fact, I'm very pleased to see you. You look sensational. Dance? You bet. ( uptempo music playing ) Do you think if you loosened up, it would rain? What's the matter with you, Keith? I don't like country music. How come you're not dancing with Jemsen? Oh, hell, not you, too. I hear he's a real nice guy. I didn't know you'd met him. I didn't, but I like him. He's got itchy feet and our people like that sort of thing 'cause we used to move around a lot. - Can we change the subject? - All right. So, you know, back in the old days, my people would say that you're binding your husband in time that's already spent and used up, that you're keeping him from moving on to the spirit world. I guess if you're a Christian, you'd say that he was in hell - and you're holdin' him there. - And you believe that? Maybe. I don't know. Well, it doesn't seem like your tribe has a lot of respect for the dead. ( Keith laughs ) On the contrary, we have a great deal of respect for the dead. We just think that live folks are better company. Well, I don't want anyone else, okay? I just want-- I just wanna go home. Phew. I tried. So what you're telling me is this was just a job. Well, we needed the money for my mom's therapy and Jill also thought that I could help her. And you're sure it's not more than that? - I'm sure. - Mm-hmm. But I don't have to believe this. Don't worry about it. She hates my guts. Really? Well, I love you. Excuse me, I'm ready to go home now. It's your dime, boss. After this dance. Will you stop calling me that? Okay, Jenny knows everything. I'm leaving with her tonight. Jenny? Yeah, Jenny. That's her name. - That wasn't so bad. - I guess. Jenny: I thought she'd be sad to see you go. Bryan: No, that's not an issue with Garnet. - ( thumps ) - Oh! ( music stops ) Leaving with her tonight? Boy, you sure didn't waste any time, did ya? And what's it to you? Um... gosh, I think you said you loved me? It doesn't mean anything unless you love me back. - I did. - No, you didn't. You loved anything like Michael you saw in me. Uh, he wrote me a song, you move clouds. - That's not like Michael. - Yeah, and you might have wanted to love me for it. I mean, some women might have thought that was kinda nice! - Women: Yeah! - But you chickened out. I gave you a piece of me and you went upstairs and made love to a dead guy. You're afraid to love me or anybody. You're afraid! You're afraid. Well, I owe you this. Come on. Man: Come on. Let's get go see what's goin' down. - Jenny: Bryan! - Man #2: Hurry up! Come on, let's go. Where are you taking me? Come on. ( moos ) I'm not gonna let you do this. This is crazy. He's my bull. I know what you're up to. You sure you wanna go through with this? Is there any way to hold on to that bull for a minute so I can climb on? Yeah, we got a chute over there but he'd probably kick it down. ( chuckles ) I'll get some ropes on him. Come on, boys! Let's get him in the chute. No! This is insane. This isn't gonna change anything. All you're gonna do is get yourself broken up. I brought you out here to show you something. No, you stupid ox. Pop, you're not gonna help him. Man: Hey, bull! ( whistles ) Bryan, somebody just told me that that animal killed that woman's husband. Now, you can't do this. I'll be fine. It's something I have to do. No, you don't. Look, I have an interest here, too. Now, I know you think it's noble or something, but she doesn't need this. Right now she needs me more than anybody in the world. I'm going to the car now. If our future means anything at all to you, Bryan, you'll come with me. Jenny... I'm not in love with you the way I should be. It wouldn't be fair not to love you the best that I can. I'm sorry. Good luck, Bryan. - ( bull bellows ) - Man: Make him come to you! - Man: Open the slide! - Man #2: Watch his flank! - Yes. - You've gotta stop him, Pop. Man: Pull! He can take a look. Hey, bull. Hey, bull. - All right, shut that gate! - Easy, easy now. Keith: Here, put this on. - Is there anything I have to know? - Keith: Too late now. Yeah, there's a damn sight you need to know, but for right now, just take a tight wrap and keep your weight back. How do I get him to stop if I wanna get off? ( men laughing ) Just keep your heels high and your weight in the middle. Here. Put this on. At least you look like you know what you're doing. ( bellows ) I'm not gonna watch this. - Keith: Got your seat? - I have no idea. ( grunts ) All right, let him buck. - Man: Come on! - Bryan: Yah! - ( crowd cheering ) - Ooh, oh! Whoa! Oh! - Hey, Garnet, you watching? - Are you done yet? I guess not. Grab him again, boys. - Whoa! - Oh! Woman: Go, Bryan! - Whoa! Oh! - ( crowd cheering ) Whoa! - Will you please stop this? - No. I'm begging you. Don't do this to me. Sorry. I can't stop now. Can't? You mean you won't. And you want me to believe that you love me. You selfish, pigheaded, inconsiderate son of a bitch. - I'm doing this for you. - No, you're not. If you cared about me at all, you wouldn't do something that could kill you. Just like Michael! You think that he cared, then he loved me? Well, damn the both of you! ( gate bangs ) Hey. You okay? I gotta finish what I started. I think maybe you should quit. ( grunts ) Are you ready? - ( bull bellows ) - ( crowd cheering ) Ah! All right, that's enough. That's enough! Are you hurt? - Are you okay? - ( moans ) Are you blind? My arm feels like it's been ripped off. My testicles ache and I'm bruised all over, but you're missin' the point-- I'm alive. I can still die. You still think by dying Michael deserted you. He didn't. Love doesn't die. Don't you get it? You don't get it. ( car engines start ) Give you a ride home if you want one. ( sighs ) Hey, Cuddles. Hey! Come on. Go on now. Leave me. I don't need you anymore. Go on! Good boy. Wait. Go get a horse and take a rope. You just released about a ton of grief in the neighborhood. You wanna help us get it back? I don't want him anymore. ( piano music playing ) - Have a nice evening. - Thanks. - ( music ends ) - ( applause ) Thank you. Is there something you wanna hear? Yes, there is. You know, a guy can get seriously injured playing what she wants me to play. I'd still go for it. I'm not sure I can manage again. Exhausted me. Left me drained. Yeah, but you're still alive. I'm here. So what's your request? Can you play this? Yeah, I know this one. ( plays slowly ) Please. One more time. Push the clouds around. ( playing softly ) ( piano music playing )
