Heading out? Yes. Rebecca? - Goodbye, Becky. - Bye, Daddy. I love you, honey. I'll see you soon. [thud] [ding] Rebecca, what's this I hear about you working until 11:00 last night? 11:30. And before you give me another lecture, you should know I still got a good night's sleep and ate a balanced breakfast. A granola bar is not a balanced breakfast. Harvey's looking for you, by the way. - Sounds pretty urgent. - It's not even 9:00. I wonder whose feathers I ruffled this time. You? Might be easier to ask whose you didn't. Hah! - That's preposterous. - No, that's libel. The man was guilty. Not according to the jury! That's because the judge threw out half the evidence. It doesn't change the fact that the man was exonerated! He had expensive lawyers. Yeah, and now those same expensive lawyers are after your head. And I'm inclined to give it to them. - You're not gonna fire me. - Oh, really? Why is that? Because you enjoy yelling me at me too much. Don't oversell yourself. Fine. Issue a retraction, and I'll write an apology for tomorrow's edition. Happy? They want your sources. [scoffs] Over my dead body. Oh, I suggested that. You think the board has forgotten what happened last year? That wouldn't happen to be the same board that asked me to write an article on which supermodel a Giants quarterback is dating? People like human interest stories! I'm not giving them my sources, Harvey. Fine. I'm suspending you. One month. You wouldn't last one week without me. Really? You wanna make it two? Fine! Merry Christmas! [phone rings] Rebecca Clark. Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be His people." 25 years after her husband James was taken from us in a boat accident, Catherine now stands at the gates of heaven. And as the Bible says, "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore, for the old things have passed away." So let us take this time not to mourn Catherine, but to celebrate her life as she is welcomed into the kingdom of God. Amen. Your mother was a dear friend. A heart attack at her age? It was too soon. Thank you for coming. Excuse me. Who's that? I don't know. I know you two had your differences, but if you need anything, someone to talk to while you're here, anything. You're part of the family, so you don't have to feel alone. Thanks, you guys. [sighs] There's still so much to do, and I really need to get back to the city. So soon, huh? I promise I'll call before I leave. Come here. Hang in there, okay? Yes. Take care, Rebecca. I'll see you later, Mr. Walker. Ah, call me Logan, huh? Thanks, Logan. I love you, Mommy. I love you too, sweetheart. ♪♪ When's Daddy coming home? I know you miss your father, honey, but as long as you have that, you'll never be alone. [winding] ♪♪ Okay. Let's do this. Hmm. Odd. Twelve years, twelve cards. They finally stopped year before last. Hadleyville? Never heard of it. Apparently, it's a small town up the coast. And you don't know anyone who lives there? Distant friends? Relatives? No one. Is it possible your mom had a special friend? You mean a boyfriend? Well, I mean, your father died 25 years ago. You spent most of that time in a boarding school. That's a long time to be alone. I guess. When was the last time you talked to her? I called her about a month ago on her birthday. I'd just broken up with Quinn. I guess I wanted someone to talk to. And of course we ended up arguing about that. She wanted me to settle down. House, a white picket fence, snuggling up by the Christmas tree. You know, that's just not me. It was a stupid argument. I should never have let it get to me. I just never knew that that would be the end. No. This is not your fault. To think she had this whole relationship, and I never knew anything about it. If I hadn't pushed her away or been so stubborn, maybe she would've told me about him. Whoever sent these, he might not even know that she's died. Can you imagine that? Not knowing that the woman you love has passed away? That's sad. I don't even know who he is. Uh-oh. - What? - Don't "what" me. I know that look. - What look? - That look. The one in your eyes right now. Is your dad still doing the P.I. thing? More like the golf and water aerobics thing. But if you're serious, he actually has this friend from the military. He's been helping him out on a couple of cases. Oh, sure. Call your dad's old army buddy to ask him to help find my mom's secret lover? That's not creepy. Do you wanna find the guy or not? All right, I'll tell you what. I will text you Andrew's number just in case you change your mind. Fine. [typing] [sighs] Fine. Have it your way. [line ringing] ♪♪ [country] Miss Clark. How'd you know? Well, you're wearing a winter jacket in Los Angeles, your shoes are more functional than stylish, and you're holding your cell phone like you're expecting a call from somebody you're meeting. I always hold my phone like this. Do you know there's a link between cell phone dependency and anxiety? Thanks for meeting me on such short notice. No worries. I'm actually in the middle of a case. A case? Here? Yeah. Step into my office. I'll show you. All right. Check it out. You see that tall guy standing over there? The one that's looking around like he doesn't wanna see anybody he knows here? - Uh-huh. - That's Paul. Turns out Paul's bride-to-be is having reservations. She thinks he might have a dark side she doesn't know about. Well, does he? Well, as a matter of fact, he does. Her name's Vanessa. She's a spinning instructor at Paul's gym. What neither of them know is I installed a GPS tracking system on the right rear bumper of Paul's car. They've been "spinning" twice a week for a month. When are you gonna break the news to his fiancée? Seven minutes ago. Which means any minute we ought to be seeing... Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? What is the matter with you?! We're getting married in three days! I love my job. Can I get you anything? Um, I'll have a pinot grigio, please. And I'll have another beer. Thank you. By the way, um, I'm sorry to hear about your mom. Logan gave you the 411. Well, he didn't have to. It's my job to know people. So you're nosy. When you spend as much time on the frontlines as I have, you learn to read people pretty quickly. Okay, Sherlock, what else do you know about me? Well, I know that you were born in the United States, but judging by your accent, I bet you spent a little time overseas. I'm thinking boarding school in England. London. And you're a reporter for the New York Ledger, and you're currently on suspension, which is BS, by the way, because that guy's definitely guilty. How do you know Mary's father again? He and my dad served together back in the day. He talked a lot about your father, by the way. Yeah? That last case that they worked on, the case against the billionaire guy? Charles Peterson. Yeah, I mean, to have Logan and your dad do all that work just to have the case dismissed because of some evidential technicality, it's a tough break. Well, that was a long time ago. Thank you. So... what can I do for you, Ms. Clark? Well, I want to know... who sent this. A Christmas mystery, huh? No name, no return address. It's not gonna be easy. There's twelve in all. Whoever sent it sent one like it every year. No name, no address, just a single heart. Any suspects? No, but I think she meant a lot to whoever sent it. He deserves to know what happened. Are you sure that's what this is about? It has nothing to do with finding out more information about the secret man in her life? I get it. I do. I know what it's like to lose parents. My dad was a fireman. He died when I was young. My mom passed away when I was deployed. I'm sorry. If there was information I could find out about them, something I didn't know, I'd feel exactly the same way. So you'll do it? I'll try. There's not a lot to go on, but I can give it shot. The least I can do is run the card for prints. Can I borrow those? Sure. Oh, no, please. Drink's on me. Well, it was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Clark. I'll call you when I have something. Bye.

Hi. Hey. I brought breakfast. I don't remember telling you where I live. I'm a P.I., remember? Ah. That's creepy. And Logan told me. Figures. Mind if I come in? Which way is the kitchen? Please. Help yourself. Sorry. The place is a bit of a mess. I wasn't expecting company. Don't worry. Just relax. I'll take care of everything. Do you have a percolator? A what? How about a kettle? You know, a big metal object you boil water with? I don't know. Do you ever cook? Of course you don't. [laughs] So I was able to run those cards you gave me for fingerprints. Did you find one? I found too many, actually. Your mom, the mailman, the mail sorter. It'd be impossible to match them all. But I was able to find out where they were sent from. - Oh? - Yeah, I used the... the postmark on the envelope. I traced it to this place called the Hadleyville Postal Place. It's like one of these private PO box-type places. And guess what. There happens to be a card store right next door. You have coffee? Oh, just up there. And so I checked, and it turns out that they're the only one in the area that sells that brand of card. Oh, really. Of course they don't remember anything specifically about the customers, but when I mentioned the calligraphy, they say there's this woman at the postal place who's known for doing address labels. Wow. So now what? I think we should go up there. Show her the cards and see if she remembers any of them. You mean go to Hadleyville? It's four hours away. You want to solve the mystery, right? Wanna find out who sent the cards? I was hoping for an address or an email so I could let them know what happened to my mom. Maybe even a photo. You're an investigative reporter. You should live for a good mystery. It's almost Christmas. I'm still trying to deal with my mom's estate. I'm cleaning this place so I can sell it, and I can't just leave. Look, I promise. I'll have you back by the 25th. You wanna find this guy, wanna tell him what happened, you're gonna have to go to Hadleyville. And maybe you can get some answers while you're there too. I better go get dressed then. All right, great. Why don't you pack, and I'll get the coffees to go. Okay, just one night. Yeah, of course. Oh, Rebecca, one more thing. Yes? How do you feel about dogs? Oh, boy. Knew it. Hey. What do you think? To be honest, when you said "dog," I was imagining something... What, manlier? I was gonna say bigger. I found him digging in the dumpster a couple years ago behind my apartment building. No one claimed him, so I took him in. Guess I have a soft spot for orphans. He doesn't look like much, but Murray's got it where it counts. Don't you, buddy? Look at this face. He's a vicious tough guy. He's a real beast. You can pet him. He loves the attention. I'll take your word for it. All right. Don't worry, Murray. You're gonna be in the backseat. I'll drive. Let's rock and roll, baby. Here you go, buddy. Here we are. What do you think? REBECCA: It's not really my scene. [scoffs] Of course it isn't. Thanks. WOMAN: Be right out! You should have left him in the car. Can't leave them in the car. That's cruel. Crack a window. Maybe I should leave you in the car. How can I help you folks? Hi. I'm actually looking for someone. I was hoping you might be able to help. I traced the postmark here. But as you can see, there's no names. The only thing on the card is a heart. The woman next door said that you do calligraphy for address labels. Not too much anymore. Everyone's doing too much email these days. What about these? Do you have any recollection who might have sent that? If you could tell us anything, anything at all, it'd be a really big help. Even I could remember, our customer information is private. I know, but... Look, it's almost Christmas, and this poor girl just lost her mother recently. Her dad died when she was very young. I'm asking as a retired marine if there's anything you can do to help her out... Alma. 114. - 114? - That was his box number. I remember box numbers better than I remember names. You know, he was kind of a peculiar fella. Paid every year upfront in cash. You said it was his box number. Haven't seen him in a while. I just assumed he moved. Let me check. Yup. 114's vacant. Sorry. Is there a name in there? My records only go back 18 months. Would you remember anything about him? What he looked like? Thick gray hair, nice smile, kinda quiet. Did he ever mention anything about who he sent the cards to? Like I said, he was quiet. But now that you bring it up, he did mention his sweetheart a couple of times. Tell you what. I've got some unclaimed mail in the back. Maybe there's something in there with his name on it. Just don't tell anyone. Oh, it'll be our little secret. Help yourself. So now I know what one of your skills is. Oh, yeah? What's that? Charming information out of elderly ladies. Maybe she'll even bake you an apple pie. Cute. Any luck? No, not yet. This stuff must go back ten years, at least. I am curious. How do you go from the military to private detective? I don't know. Like I said, I guess I'm just good at reading people. Like Alma? What do you want to know? What can you tell me? Well, I can tell you she's a widower, and that she took over the business after her husband died. I know she has a son and a grandson in the military and that the grandson is still stationed overseas. I know she recently had a heart attack, and that's planning on retiring, probably 'cause of doctor's orders. How can you possibly know all that? A magician never reveals his secrets. Seriously. Please. Okay, uh... She had a tan line where her wedding ring used to be, Now she wears it on her neck, which means she wants to keep him close, yet she's open to something new. There were old cards on the wall that were sent to Donald and Alma at this address, which implies he used to work here. And the military? There was an armed forces sticker on the window, which means somebody very close to them was in the military, but it was at least twenty years old. The postcard on the counter was from Kabul. It's more recent. So somebody that's been in the military for 20 years, they're not likely stationed on the frontlines anymore, so I went with the grandson. And what about the heart? I saw four medicine bottles on her desk, next to a catalog for a retirement community. Lotensin, Toprol, Lipitor and aspirin. That's a combination of medications usually for... After a heart attack. Right. You learned all that in the military? No. I had a thing with a medic. A thing? A thing. Like a thing. Don't they frown upon that? You gotta find something to occupy your time in between getting shot at. Was she cute? No, not really. Hey, I found something. What? PO box 114. - Nothing. - What do you mean? He has to be in there somewhere. You know you're not supposed to have dogs in here, don't you? I'm sorry. We didn't want to leave him in the car. We already know Mr. Semral had a box at the post office for several years. He must have lived around here somewhere. All I can tell you is that he didn't pay property taxes, and he wasn't registered to vote. [stifled sneeze] What about the social security system? This guy has to be in some system somewhere. That would be confidential. All right. Well, thank you for your time. Wait, that's it? You just can't give up. You heard the man. He's not in the system. He has to be in there. Sorry. My girlfriend, sometimes she gets a little worked up. Girlfriend? Come on. Let's go. Not until we get some answers. Rebecca, come on. Fine. Thank you for your time. Just go, just go. Thank you. Thank you. What was that all about? We could've gotten more information. For an investigative reporter, you'd think you'd be a little bit better at reading people. What's that supposed to mean? - He told us everything he knew. - Which was nothing. We have to get into that other database. Well, unfortunately he was telling the truth. Those records are confidential. So we're back to square one. Well... I wouldn't say that. Hey, it's lunch. We're gonna go across the street and grab a burger. I'm coming right now. Hurry up. We don't know what time they'll be back from lunch. Relax. No entry found. Someone's coming. I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying. Quick. This way. I don't know what I did with my card. I must have left it in here somewhere. I left mine in the cafeteria two weeks ago. You know they charged me 40 bucks for it? - [stifled sneeze] - Are you getting sick? I'm allergic to dogs. - [sneeze] - Bless you. Oh, my goodness. Excuse me. Oh, here's my card right here. Oh, good. - Thanks, man. - Yeah. I told you not to worry. [line ringing] [ringing continues] Damn. Hey, she's coming back. I gotta go. Who was that? Just a client checking in. How'd you make out? No answer. It's getting pretty late. We should probably think about where we're gonna stay tonight. I think we passed that bed and breakfast on the way into town. A bed-and-breakfast? Come on, it'll be great.

I mean, you're probably closer to him than anyone else. Is there anything I should know? Is he seeing anyone? What kind of food does he like? What kind of music does he listen to? Does he snore? You're not helping. Come on. We're back! ANDREW: I'm almost done. I was getting worried there. Are you hungry? I thought maybe we could go get something to eat. Uh, yeah, that sounds good. You know, um, why don't you finish getting ready, and I can meet you in the lobby in like 20 minutes? Sure. And keep an eye on Murray for me. All right. I'll see you in a bit. Grownup clothes. I didn't think you had it in you. Me? Look at you. You look absolutely stunning. Should I remind you that technically I'm your boss? - You hungry? - Starving. REBECCA: I even left my cell phone in my room. ANDREW: Good idea. So how long did you serve? Eight years. I saw the scars. Are those war wounds? Uh, yeah, a few of them. I can't imagine the pain you must have gone through. Or still going through. Yeah, well, it comes with the job. I made it. Some of my buddies didn't. I'm sorry. You know, I can't help but think about their families, especially this time of year, being without the ones they loved. What about you? Any special Christmas memories? No, no. It was always pretty low key 'cause of my dad. With the work and everything. Ah, fireman. Right. You know, my mom, she used to... she used to write these little notes, and she'd put them in his lunches, and then around Christmas, she'd... she'd cut out like pictures from magazines, newspapers, anything that reminded her of the holiday, and she'd make a little collage for him. That's such a romantic thing to do. Even after he died, every single day she continued to write him a note. She never wanted to break the habit. You know, they're gone now and... I don't know. It's funny. It doesn't really feel like Christmas unless you have someone to buy gifts for. My mom and I were a mess after my dad's accident. Is that why you went away to school? She thought it would be good for me. You don't agree. I don't know. Just kinda felt like... Like she was trying to get rid of you. Anyway, if it wasn't for Mary and Logan, I don't think we would've made it. I shouldn't have left things the way that I did. - What happened? - It was a fight. Over a guy, of course. She didn't think I should've ended things. I thought it was... It was none of her business? It was silly. After, it felt easier to avoid her than to talk about it. I never got a chance to say I'm sorry. I never got to tell her how much I loved her. Kids grow up. They move on, and they start lives of their own. Sometimes parents forget about that. You had no idea what was gonna happen. You couldn't have. You can't beat yourself up over it. She used to have this expression: "Ships that pass in the night." I always thought she was talking about my father, but she might as well have been talking about us. "Ships that pass in the night and speak each other in passing. Only a signal shown and a distant voice in the darkness. So on this ocean of life, we pass and speak one another. A look and a voice, and then darkness again and the silence." Wow. Longfellow. So you think finding Jack will mean... that your mom wasn't as lonely as you thought. She might even have been happy. You know what? Come on. Oh, no. I don't dance. Good, 'cause neither do I. Come on. Okay. ♪♪ ["O Little Town of Bethlehem"] [growls] [yips] I'd ask you in, but I'm not sure I trust myself. Well, it's probably best. I mean, technically you're my boss. So what's the plan for tomorrow then? Uh, well, keep trying the number. I'll see what I can pull off the social security number I got. So the trail's not cold? ANDREW: No. Not even close. Well, good night. Good night. Murray? [whines] [running footsteps] - [screams] - Hey, hey, it's me. What's going on? What are you doing down here? There was someone in my room. Are you sure? Did you see him? I don't know. I heard something. Okay, okay. Look, let's get you back. We'll call the police. - What time d'you get back here? - 9:30. That's when you noticed the door was open? Yeah. How many room keys do you have? Just the one. What about the owner? I'm sure he has one. - I've already spoken to Dennis. - And? He said it hasn't left his possession all night. Or he used it himself. Is it possible you just forgot to lock the door? - I didn't forget to the lock... - But it is possible? Yes. As far as you can tell, anything missing? No. And you didn't actually see anyone. No. Look... I know who you are, and I'm familiar with your views on law enforcement. So here's how this is going to work. Gonna take this statement, gonna file a report. If at a later point you realize there is something missing, the incident will be on file. Other than that, there's really nothing more I can do. Are we finished here? Actually I'm looking for an old friend of my mother's. You might have heard of him. Jack Semral? Never heard of him, Sorry. Have a nice evening. All right. He's all set. What's this? Your new roommate. No, no. Don't worry. He doesn't snore, he won't hog the bed, and best of all, he cooks his own meals. Andrew, I'm not taking your dog. Rebecca, you've had a very long night. I'd feel much better if Murray was here to look after you. Andrew... Come on. One night. All right, buddy. Here you go. [chuckles] All right, buddy. You be a good boy for Ms. Rebecca, okay? Here's his food. All right, big guy, you have a good night. - Night. - All right, good night. So cute. Okay, Murray, you can stay. But one thing first, while we eat, the most important rule, under no circumstances can you sleep... on the bed. [gasps] Sorry, boy. Bad dream. ANDREW: No. They checked for prints, but they didn't find anything. That's right. Really? Okay, great. Thank you. Hey. Little fuel? - We got a busy day. - Really? That social security number? Turns out somebody ran a background check on an employee a while back. It's some shop a few miles down the road. - Should we check it out? - Yeah. MAN: Jack hasn't worked here since... I guess it'll be two years in February. REBECCA: But he did work here. MAN: Yeah, sure. Great employee, hard worker. I never understood what happened. What do you mean? What happened? He started getting paranoid all of a sudden. Said he thought somebody was following him. Then one day he didn't show up. He just took off. Did he ever happen to mention a woman named Catherine? No, but he never really talked about his personal life. Really private that way. Are you two relatives of his? Not exactly. Hey, you wouldn't happen to have a home address or anything like that, would you? I might have something. Hold on Well, if he left, that would explain why the cards stopped. Yeah, but what happened? Why'd he leave? The guy lives here for 12 years, and no one knows him? It just doesn't make sense. How did he know my mother? Sounds like someone's on the case. There's a lot of questions that need answering, wouldn't you say? It's a good thing that we're here then, wouldn't you say? Fine. You're right. Is that what you want to hear? Here you go. For what it's worth, I hope you guys find him. Thank you so much. This is really helpful - Thank you. - No problem. REBECCA: Are you sure this is it? Jack Semral lived here? ANDREW: It is the address he gave me. What is it? The mat. Someone's been here recently. [door opens] - Whoa, whoa, easy. - Who are you? - What are you doing here? - Ellen sent me. Back up. Stand back. I'm not doing anything, man. - Who's Ellen? - Ellen Larson. - The woman who owns the house. - Why'd she send you? Neighbor said he heard some noise, so he called her, and then she asked if I could come over and check it out. What are you doing here? - We're looking for Jack Semral. - You're a little late. He's been gone for a couple years now. Place has been empty ever since. Then who did this? I thought you did. Any idea where Jack might have gone? One day he just left. No notice or anything. I told Ellen not to rent to anyone without a credit check. Are you friends of his? Something like that. Look, if you didn't do this, then who did? No idea. I was about to call the sheriff myself. Why don't you let us look around for a few minutes, then you can call the sheriff. Why? What are you looking for? Ellen's not the only one Mr. Semral left hanging. I don't know. I know you're trying to do the right thing, but think about your wife and little baby at home. All the hours you're putting in at the hospital to take care of them. Do the right thing. Is 15 minutes enough time? Perfect. I don't even want to ask. Wedding ring, little orange spot of baby spit up on his shoulder. Shoes... Nursing clogs. You're a fast learner. And no more guns, okay? I'd like to live through Christmas. Thanks very much. Right. So who did this? I'm beginning to think we're not the only ones looking for your mother's friend. So that's why they broke into my room. The question is for what. Maybe he left something behind. ANDREW: A clue as to where he might be. REBECCA: Assuming whoever did this can find it. Wait. ANDREW: What? The beach. Look at it. Yeah, it's like a photograph. Exactly. She was here. Look. This was taken right here. My mother was here. She looks so happy. Peaceful. She was in love. There has to be something in there that'll tell us where Jack went. Wait a minute. How'd you know to look there? It's exactly where I would've hid something. Photographs. What is it? Looks like Jack wasn't just paranoid. He was being watched. Why would he leave these behind? He must have been in some kind hurry. [distant sirens] Like us. Come on. Let's go. I can't believe she was there. With him. Maybe they were closer than you thought. She never said anything. She was living this whole secret life all this time, and I had no idea. Yeah, well, maybe she thought you wouldn't understand. Maybe she was trying to protect you. Yeah. Maybe. What is it? I think we're being followed. What? What do we do? Hold on. It's still coming. I see it. Andrew! Hold on. Hold on. [groans] My arm. Are you okay? I think so. Come on. Let's get out of here. [engine starts] Look, Rebecca, maybe we should stop all this. What? Why? Whatever Jack Semral was into, I mean, clearly he's in some kind of trouble. I can't help but think that we're in over our heads here. We're getting so close. I can feel it. Yeah, but I don't want you to get hurt. I told Logan that I'd look after you. I owe it to him to bring you back in one piece. I'm going to find him, and I'm gonna do it with or without you, although with would be better. What? Nothing. Just thinking. About? Whether a big-city reporter and an ex-military grunt could... you know. You think too much. Do I? ANDREW: I don't know. She's determined. No, no, look that is not part of the deal. I'm just supposed to watch her. No, no, we haven't found him yet. Yes, of course, you'll be the first to know. Look, there's something I've gotta take care of. I'll talk to you later, okay? All right. Is everything okay? I'm not sure. [phone ringing] [ring] Metro desk. Hi. It's me. You must want the funnies. - I'll transfer you. - Very cute. So how's vacation? Tell me you're lounging by the pool, while the rest or your colleagues are here in New York freezing our knishes off. No. I need your help with something. Do I even wanna ask? I'm emailing you some photos. I found these hidden in a drawer. Can you check the database for a match? Wait. Are you working a story? I just need to know who this guy is. Harvey's gonna kill me. Which is why you're not gonna tell him. Okay, let's see. Remember the days before computers when we used to go through mug shots by hand? Those were the good ol' days. Says the man who spend $500 on a sword for a video game? Okay, first of all, it was only $400, and secondly it was for elfin steel. I'd like to see you cross the fjords of Balthazar without elfin steel. Is that Clark? Um... Give it. You're a brilliant writer. Do I really need to define the term "suspended" for you? - I miss you too. - Rebecca... It's not a story. He's just helping me out. Oh, so he's using business resources for your personal matter. Fine. I'll owe you a puff piece when I get back. Make it two. Deal. Can you please give me back to Edward? Thank you for that, by the way. Okay, I got it. Your mystery man is Frank Johnson. Great. Do you have a last known address? Even better. I can tell you where he is right this second. - Great. - [coughs] Oh! You startled me. Where'd you go this morning? You left so early. Oh, I, uh, just had to run an errand. That's all. So did you find anything out about the guy? Actually, no. He wasn't able to help. That's too bad. Look, do you mind if I have a couple of hours to myself this morning? You know, with everything that happened yesterday. Of course. Take the morning off. We'll meet up for lunch. Dennis says there's a great pizza place in town. Sounds good. I'm here to see Frank Johnson. [gate buzzing] [door buzzing] [whistling] Tell me about Jack Semral. ♪ When the snow lay round about ♪ ♪ Crisp and deep and... ♪ I know you were watching him. What? I know you were watching him. I've watched a lot of people. Hadleyville. Worked in a fish market. Rented a house off Hera Drive. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You mean the older guy. Why were you watching him? I think the real question is why would a reporter from the New York Ledger travel 3,000 miles across the country to ask questions about him. Who hired you? Now you're asking expensive questions. How much? Why? He's... a friend of the family. So there is no story. You know it's a crime to lie, to lie to the warden, reporter? But you're in luck. I've got an opening for a new roommate. Just give me a name. Give me a reason. You lost someone too. Who was it? Father? Mother? All I need is a name. [humming] Fine. I see this was a complete waste of time. Cayman Savings Bank. CD 937-648-N. That's account number the wire transfers came from. That's all I know. [humming] Come on. Hah! Whoever you are, someone should really talk to you about your internet security. "Charles Peterson"? That last case that they worked on, the case against the billionaire guy? Charles Peterson. To have Logan and your dad do all that work just to have the case dismissed because of some evidential technicality... Evidential technicality. According to these wires, Charles Peterson paid Logan off. Then why were they interested in Jack Semral? Unless... Dad. What are you doing? Stay away from me! What? Rebecca. Rebecca. Help! Somebody! Rebecca! Rebecca, just... Rebecca, wait up. - What are you doing? - Let go of me! - Why are you acting like this? - I know! Know what? About Charles Peterson and Jack Semral. I have no idea what you're talking about. You've been working for him all along, haven't you? - Who? - Logan. That's where you went this morning, to tell him what was going on. Yes. He asked me to look after you. But that's it, I swear. Where were you? Tell me or I'm walking right now. Are you serious? Fine. I was buying you a Christmas present. Happy? It's beautiful. Rebecca, what's going on? You really have no idea. No idea about what? Jack Semral is my father. I don't believe it. Logan was being paid off? He must have tampered with the evidence. That's how Peterson got the case dismissed. And if my father figured it out... He would've been a loose end. He knew they were coming after him. That's why he disappeared. So he faked his death. Look, Rebecca, I swear to you, Logan, he asked me to help you. He asked me to keep him informed. That's it. I had no idea that he was being paid off. I would never hurt you. I was just doing my job. REBECCA: Sure. I get it. Well, look, what do you wanna do now? I want to go back to his house. Miss Clark, Miss Clark! I'm kinda in a hurry. Yeah, yeah, um... can you sign this? - Please? - What? My wife and I, we moved from New York a couple years ago. She insisted on keeping a subscription. She's a real big fan. All this time we thought you were stalking me. What? Oh, no, no, no! We just don't get a lot of famous people around here. Yeah. What's your wife's name? Delores. What are we looking for? I don't know. There has to be something. You knew the man. Does anything stand out? No. Nothing looks familiar. Wait a minute. A boat? Look at the sweater. I thought it was my name, but what if it isn't? A boat. A boat. I have an idea. Come on. Well? I'm running a search for his boat through AIS right now. What's that? AIS is a tracking system for boats. Class A is commercial ships, freighters, tugboats, that sort of thing. But class B is recreational boats. All we have to do is put in the name of the vessel, and it should tell us exactly where he's at. Huh. That's interesting. Did it work? Yeah. Where is he? Right here in Hadleyville. Yes! Come on. Let's go check it out. So I think we wanna go this way. Yeah. - Jack Semral? - Here. Hold on a second. ♪♪ [radio] Hello! Jack? [music stops] Hello? Is it him? No. MAN: Turn around slowly. Dad! Rebecca? I can't believe it's really you. What are you doing here? It's Mom. She passed away. I know, I know. I'm so sorry. How on earth did you find me? It's the cards you sent Mom. I found them when I was going though the house. I thought she had a secret admirer, so I hired Andrew here to track you down. The postmark led us to where you mailed them, and we followed the trail from there. Come on. Dad, where you going? Rebecca, there's so much I want to say, there's so much I need to tell you, but it's not safe for you here. Dad, I know about Logan. I know that Charles Peterson paid him off. Then you know why I left, and you know why you can't stay. I took a big chance going to the funeral. The funeral? Who's that? When I heard about Catherine, I knew I had to come. I knew I had to pay my respects no matter what the risk. A man doesn't miss his own wife's funeral. And then I saw you standing there. I am so sorry, Becky, for what I did. I missed your childhood. I missed you growing up. My marriage. One of my biggest regrets is that I couldn't tell you the truth. But I did what I had to do to protect you. Your mother understood this. That's why you had to go away. You mean boarding school? You should know... your mother hated having you that far away. It killed her. But she did what she had to do to keep you safe. I can't believe it. All that time, I thought... LOGAN: James Clark! Wow. This doesn't surprise me. I was always suspicious though, you know? Especially when my guy returned empty-handed from your boat all those years ago. But one thing still bothers me though, Jim. How could abandon your family, huh? I did it to protect them from you. Hmm. Take his gun, Andrew. Andrew! Put the gun down, Logan. I'm not... You know, I really don't wanna do this. I really don't. What do you say we all just cooperate? You drop it. Put it down! That's a good boy. REBECCA: How could you? All those years I trusted you! You lied to me! Tell me, did Mary know? Well, Mary's naive in her own little way. Frankly, I never wanted to go through with this. But you know, Jimmy, I did offer to make you a part of it all. But no, no. You had to have justice. What'd that cost you, that justice? How's that working out for you? It was me that took care of your family, not you! Dad! You know, I had a nice little retirement going. Yeah. I was fine. - This is all your fault. - No! No! No! Enough! Andrew. It's okay. You know, I never thought I'd be able to come back. That makes two of us, Dad. Boy, those smell delicious. It's Mom's old recipe. I didn't know you cooked. Well, she doesn't, but she's a quick learner. So don't everyone all jump in at once. Boy, these are delicious. I mean, you did a great job, both of you. Murray, no, no, no. It's okay. I think Murray and I are gonna become best buds. So what happens now? I guess you head back to New York, huh? Well, I've requested a transfer to the Los Angeles bureau. Are you sure Harvey's gonna be okay with that? Actually, he jumped at it. Says he can't wait for me to be someone else's problem. So do you think a big-city reporter and an ex-military grunt could... Oh, I don't know. But I'd like to find out. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, darling. Hey, hey! I'm still your father, you know. He took a bullet for me, Dad. I know, I know, but there are rules. That's all I'm saying. So... what are your intentions for my daughter? Um, well, I-I intend to take care of her to the best of my ability, keep her safe. Who's gonna keep you safe from her? Cute. Very cute. - What about grandkids? - Dad! JAMES: I gotta make up for lost time here. REBECCA: How about we start with turkey dinner? - Merry Christmas, kiddo. - Merry Christmas, Dad. [dog whines] Merry Christmas, Murray. [barking]
