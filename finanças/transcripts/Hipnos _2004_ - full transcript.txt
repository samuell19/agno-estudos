It's the inspector. - Which floor is it? - At the second one. - Any other exit? - The fire escape. It might've been a brutal experience... to provoke a shock like this. When do you think we can interrogate her? I don't know. No one does. At these moments, all her instincts... are concentrated on forgetting... and deleting of her mind what happened. Maybe it's better like this. Come in. HYPNOS Calm down. Just a fraction of a second, one millimeter away. This short is the way that keeps her away from death. Sometimes, she feels the temptation of giving a step forward to prove. It's so easy to die... - You look very different. - I guarantee you it's me. - Beatriz, isn't it? - Yes. Beatriz Vargas. I'm Elena, the chief nurse. Dr. S?nchez Blanch apologized. He's very busy. He'll see you tomorrow at his office. Come on, I'll get this. No, don't worry. Thank you. The document that was sent to Dr. Vargas. They're some of the cases S?nchez is working in. Try and have a look before your meeting with him. He's very demanding, but he's the best. You've been lucky to get in a place like this so young. Don't worry, you've came to the right place to have phobias. I'll wait for you up there. Second floor. Beatriz, this way. - You see the ocean? - Yeah. You should go out sometimes. It's not good to stay at the sanatorium the whole day. No TV, no radio, neither a coverage for your mobile phone... you end up going crazy. Would you like to see the rest or take a rest? The most patients are on the 2nd floor. The neuropsychological test are taken downhere... and the TAC scanners. What about this building? It's reserved to the most difficult cases. Usually they came in from other sanatoriums. Dr. S?nchez looks after the patients there. The only one that remains in there has been there for about 12 years. It's a very complex case. It's the ocean, right? I like the ocean as well. They found her alone, beside her murdered mother... but the police doesn't know if she was involved. Since they interned her, this has been the 1st sign of affection. Here we are again. Come, this way. The monitor room. Here all the sessions are recorded on video. Then we can follow their progress... and observe their best reactions. - Your therapy is about to begin. - Who is he? No one knows. We don't even know how he's got in here. - Amnesia? - Total. We named him "M", the letter that was on his shirt. Let's go? The nightmare of being alive and not being able to recognize yourself. Forgetting who you are... Without your memory you are nothing. Calm down. You've gotten up from bed. Everything is dark. You're shoeless at your home's restroom. What's happening? It's cold. - Gets angry. - Who gets angry? Your mother? Mom... and he. Discuss. He? Is there anyone else with you? Who? He's here with me. Really, I didn't want, I didn't want! Calm down. Calm down. You're in the bath tube, surrounded by scum. You extend your arm and slowly with a razor... you draw a furrow in your wrist... a perfect blood rose... where your life vanishes, desorientated. The only thing that lasts is to embrace death. And you finally... rest. What are you doing here? What is you cell? No, you're mistaken. I am Beatriz Vargas, the new doctor. What are you doing around here at this time... naked? Well, I was taking a shower and... Always wear the white uniform. It's what will distinguish you from the patients. Don't forget it. We're all addicted to something, to forgetfulness... to remembrance, to mistake, you just need to find the substance... the emotion that canalizes our addiction. You are here. Dr. S?nchez Blanch awaits for you in his office. Thank you. Do you like gardening, Dr. Vargas? It's a curious art. We abstain the plants from light so they can overgrow... we attach some stakes to straighten them... we prune them... You could say we manipulate them for their own good. Psychiatry does exactly the same with people, don't you think? I'm happy you are here with us. I'm sorry I couldn't welcome you yesterday. - Elena was adorable. - As usual. She told me you helped on the progress of our youngest patient. - That was luck. - It doesn't exist. I know your potential. That's why you're here. Unfortunately, she had an anxiety crisis this morning... and we had to transfer her to the adjacent pavillion. I hope I can work in this case. Oh, yes, of course. It's a complex case. My hypnosis sessions are not working. A child's unconsciousness can be... a real landscape of broken glasses. I suppose this is what makes us wish to help them. No? The childhood is supposed to be a happy age. Sure. Sure. Anyway, on the first days... I'd like you to stay with Dr. Zabala, at the consultations. He'll help you to become familiar with the center. Thank you. Ulloa, for example. His childhood is marked... by the loss and by the pain... they pushed him to a tragic destiny. Why not offering him one alternative? I am alone. But she's with me. And you're happy. Your friend makes you happy. Every time you think about her, you feel good... - comforting. - No. She's already gone. I know, Ulloa. But her recordation follows you. She loves me, but he... he... Calm down, Ulloa. Calm down. The other doesn't exist. The other doesn't exist. It doesn't exist. It's not like this. It's not like this. Ulloa... tell us about that. We're listening. It hurts. It hurts me. But you want it, don't you? You don't want to forget... because if you do you'll be forgetting a part of her. Enough, doctor. Her mother died. She tells me secrets. Hers. We share things. Till he shows up... - Tell us about him. - No! Enough. Now, Ulloa... you're gonna fall in a deep sleep. And you won't think about anything. You didn't understand anything, absolutely nothing. You don't overcome a trauma with a lie, it's not ethic. I'm not asking for you opinion, lady. I don't know what credits you got to get here... but you never interrupt me again. Never again. Did you hear him? - I'm sorry. - For what? Psychiatry is like this. No one has the absolute truth. Each patient and each doctor have to find... - their own way. - Have you found it? Are you still interested at the girl's case? Yes. Repass your description. Tomorrow at 8, wait for me in the garden. She's witnessed the presumptuous homicide... shock state. At the garden. You're in the bath tube, surrounded by scum. You extend your arm and slowly with a razor... you draw a furrow in your wrist... You never know how someone... could ask for help. During all her life... she's done it with each one of her acts. I have so many things to tell you. It's so easy to die. - What are you showing now, Dr.? - A girl's testimony... was fundamental to solve the case. - I'm not talking about that. - We have to be strong... learn with our mistakes, and keep working. You can't accept a suicide. A suicide is a failure. Failure to the institution... and a failure to the doctors. - The girl didn't get attention. - Don't worry, Beatriz. This will also be considered... and we'll do what has to be done. Can I? Oh, Ulloa. Now we need to take care of the sensitive patients. I'll talk to him. In the meantime, we have other patients to attend. This case let me hooked since the beginning. The patient has nullified the senses of anxiety and fear. His anger is explosive and uncontrolled. And it happens with no reason at all. He's attacked one of our nurses. Did the exams show any brain damage? No. Any reference in our files? None. Until we can find out the causes of his perturbation... and research about his past... there won't be much we can do for him. Does he seem disposed? I don't know what to say, Beatriz. He doesn't remember because he's afraid of remembering. While we don't figure out the reason of his fears... we won't know how to face the situation. For the time being, we can't foresee great progresses. Good morning. Today Dr. Vargas will accompany us. - How are you? - Why do you wanna talk to me? Do I know you? No. You don't know me. Well, let's begin. Everything has a beginning. Now, tell me. How did you end up in here? How did you end up in here? Nurse! Nurse! Careful, Beatriz, it wasn't a suicide. It wasn't a suicide. Bring help. Obviously he's tried to attract my attention. What I've seen was an agression of a patient with delusions. I'm not gonna allow you to take risks anymore. You said we needed to find out the causes... of his disturbs, and know about his past. Let me take care of him. You knew her well, right? Yes, very well. I'm sorry for what happenend. I wish I could... - I wish I could know... - Is that what you want, Beatriz? To know? I'm glad you're here. So? Are you coming? Ulloa! Living is getting away slowly from happiness. Only the painful umbilical cord of memory... keeps us attached to it. Ulloa! Ulloa! Hi. Come on, lean on me. Thank you. Thank you, pretty. Who did that to you? - Tell me. - No one. You can't have sex with the patients. Do you hear me? That's not good. Besides, this guy is very dangerous. He's tried to strangle me. I should relate that to Dr. S?nchez Blanch. No, please. No. No. I can't help it. He... I promise it won't happen again. I swear. I swear. Sleep. Stay with me, please. Beatriz. What happened? No. Nothing. I couldn't sleep and... I went to get some pills. And what's that? A little accident. - Is it deep? - No. Just impressing. Beatriz. What happened? No, nothing. And what's that? A little accident. - Is it deep? - No, just impressing. I think I'll take a shower and get ready to work. All right, Beatriz. I see you soon. It wasn't a suicide. - You draw a furrow... - I think it was murder. Calm down. It's just us? That haircut suits you. Thank you. - Is it necessary? - I hope not. Everything depends on your behaviour. Yes. How are you today? Better than the other day? Better. Do you remember what happened? Vaguely. Do you remember what you told me about the girl... that hasn't comitted suicide? - No. - All right. This will help you to relax. Are you ready? This is the day before you entered the sanatorium. - Where are we? - I don't know. Do you see the streets or the noises of a city? It's night. It's raining outside. Everything is calm. Everything is peaceful. We're not alone. - Who are you with? - I don't know. It's soft, it's sweet. What's happening? What happens? I hear screams, someone screams. Calls me. - What name do they scream? - Miguel! Miguel! Miguel? Tell me, what's going on? There's a screw-driver... and she wants to kill. - Who, Miguel? - Not her. Not her. A screw-driver, Miguel? A screw-driver. She wants to kill. She's jealous, she wants to kill. - Not her, not her. - All right. Ulloa, what are you doing here? Something is about to happen. What is it? - Something bad... bad. - No, it's not. Nothing is gonna happen. She's back. She's here. Who? Ulloa, who's back? She's back to get you away from me! Calm down, please. Don't move, Ulloa. Ulloa! Good morning. - Leave us, please. - I'll be outside. - How are you today? - I don't know, you tell me. Unfortunately we can't renounce that yet. But we're making progress, Miguel. Miguel. Yes. I'm relaxed, doctor. - The girl didn't commit suicide. - You've told me that. Things are not what they look like, Beatriz. Haven't you realized what happens in here? What happens in here? They make you believe they commited suicide... when they were killed, induced homicides. Don't you believe it? I'm a cop, Beatriz. This sanatorium is being investigated for a long time. Many deaths, many secrets and no results. That's why... No, no, no. I've confined myself as a patient, to find evidences... that could allow me to stop this madness. You've just arrived. You're not under their influence yet. You must believe me... before any other death. I need your help, Beatriz. You've said about a woman yesterday. You don't know what you've got yourself into. A woman with a screw-driver. I knew that girl. I also know she didn't want to die. All right. All right, don't believe me. But, please, search the truth for yourself. Do it soon! Before... it's too late. It's night. It's night and it's raining outside. Miguel, who are you with? The files are available only until 8 pm. I just need to review a set of expedient. Quiet! What are you doing here? Let me out. I'm not gonna hurt you, Beatriz. I knew you wouldn't fail. Do you believe me now? There was nothing. The files of the last 3 years were empty. They know it. They know they're being watched. Please, Miguel... What else do you need to believe me? You're in jeopardy. Soon there'll be more deaths. Be careful, Beatriz. Beatriz... what about your phobia? - He should be in his cell. - They're looking for him. What did he do to you? Are you OK? The memory is constantly invaded... by the imagination and by the dreams. We always end up changing the truth into our lie. What are you doing here? What does that mean? I've found it on the beach. It's yours. It can't be mine. Mine is here. Ulloa? Dr. Vargas... could I know where you have been? Dr. S?nchez Blanch has asked for you. - I'm looking for Ulloa. - He's with him. SUICIDE SUICIDE Doctor? Ulloa's expedient. Thank you. - Beatriz, I'm glad to see you. - The door was open and... Don't worry. I was with Ulloa. His therapy with Dr. Zabala wasn't bringing results. Then, I've dismissed him from the case. He's much more peaceful. I see you've got the files. I've prepared them so you can take a look. All the suicides that happened in the sanatorium. They're many, however... we can consider it as a success. You also think that what happened to the girl was a success? The night before... the suicide, I heard how you persuaded her to kill herself. No... that's not what you heard. Let's take a walk. We all accept that the past marks our present... inspires our future, although, there're occasions that our future... our idea of what's gonna happen... that pushes us to change it into reality. Do you understand? You mean we can assimilate... our future as part of our past? We can convince our unconscious... of what happened. With no trauma, no pain. If a man knows he's already realized certain things... he won't look for them anymore, he'll disdain them. Of course it doens't work. Absolutely. None of these cases were mine... till the other day. The death of this girl should not have happened. After all, doctor... tell how the therapy of M is going. Paranoiac personality... deliriums, hallucinations... mania of persecution... dissociation. I know you'll do a good job, Beatriz. You're already doing. Hi. Do you get involved with your patients like that? - I don't what you're talking about. - Always the same. The ones that play fool are the worst. You've been with S?nchez Blanch. Miguel, I need your cooperation. I need you to let me help you. I don't want this kind of help. Miguel, the evolution to a dissociation level... is normal in cases of amnesia. I don't have amnesia. I know very well why I am here. I'm a cop. My badge and my pistol... are buried underneath the pine trees, beside the tunnel. Don't you believe me? You don't believe anything I say. Prove yourself. It's very easy. My badge and my pistol... It's absurd. - I'll be back when you get better. - You have nothing to lose. And if you don't find what I say, you get a patient. I'll do what you ask. I swear. - Chavi. - Beatriz! Someone is interfering in your life... changing your feelings... your time perception... but you don't know who. Chavi! Someone is interfering in your life... changing your feelings... your time perception... but you don't know who. I need to see the patient. At this time? Under my complete responsability. Please. I've found your badge and your pistol. And... they killed Ulloa. - It was my fault. - You didn't kill anyone. S?nchez Blanch told me that... How could I have been so stupid? There was no sense, but I believed him. This is his power. To make you believe in the impossible. - You can't blame yourself. - And why...? Why does he do that? Come on. Come on. Come on. I don't wanna see him again. - I don't wanna see him again. - You have to go alone. Calm down. You have to go alone. I have to watch S?nchez Blanch. - You're in jeopardy, go. - I don't wanna go alone. - Don't worry about me. - I don't wanna go alone. Take my badge to the nearest police station. - They'll know what to do. - Miguel, please... It'll be all right. It'll be all right. I promise. No one's gonna hurt you. I'm sorry, but you can't get out. What do you mean I can get out? I'll have to talk to Dr. S?nchez Blanch. No, I don't have to talk to anyone. Dr. S?nchez Blanch can't stop me from getting out. Wait a moment. Police station. - Doctor... - Do you need help? It's not necessary. I suppose I'll take the doctor to her room. - She's a little bit nervous. - Get off. I talk to Dr. S?nchez Blanch by myself... about this misunderstanding. We're not only connected by the past... but also by the future. Yours has been written a long time ago. It grows like a cancer... outward... slowly... You can't escape from it. Ulloa? Ulloa? Ulloa... Beatriz. What's going on? - What's going on? - Don't worry, Beatriz. You'll be fine in a few days. - What's going on with me? - You've had a nervous crisis... and you've taken some pills in excess. What about Miguel? Miguel attacked you again. He could've killed you if the nurse weren't there. - This is bullshit. - You're the one who insisted... - for you transference. - You lie. I've been with him last night. I'm telling you what happened. You're crazy. No. I wanna get out of here. I'm sorry, Beatriz. Believe me, this is for your own good. Let me out. I wanna get out. Please. I wanna get out. Please. Why do we tend to repeat what they've done to us... to repeat the same mistakes... to perpetuate our experiences? Feeling better? At last... I'm sorry you deny to collaborate No, I don't wanna die. Please. Be calm. I don't need your sessions. Why do you struggle, Beatriz? Why do you struggle? The future shows up dark, voluble. When yours changes into yesterday... you'll be immobile forever. You don't attach yourself to anything, Beatriz. Madness is an irruption of the dreams in reality. Bad is not distinguish them. Give me the pills, please. I want my pills. Do you hear me? - Elena... - How are you, pretty? S?nchez Blanch is crazy. He wants to kill me. I know I'm the next. You must help me. All right, Beatriz. Calm down. I'll help you. You were right, Elena, you'll have to strengthen the treatment. Elena, why are you doing this? Why? Is it for Miguel? Don't go away, bitch! You're old! He wants to destroy me. You can't with me, doctor. I wanna live. To live? Look to your future, Beatriz. It's written in it, your suicide. You're going to meet your destiny. It's useless to try to fight back. - Absorb it. - Like Ulloa? Like the girl? You're crazy, doctor. Crazy? I didn't do this. Beatriz, I'll help you. How are you? I'm better. I'm happy, Beatriz. In a few weeks... Beatriz, let yourself go for a moment... and stop asking yourself who speaks. Beatriz. What is it, honey? Are you OK? Do you wanna say something? Let's see. Let's see. What is it, my little girl? Beatriz... What are you doing? What's going on in here? Don't, Elena, no. Don't touch her. Bastard! What are you doing with my daughter? Mommy. What have I done, Beatriz? What have we done, Beatriz? It might've been a brutal experience... to provoke a shock like this. When do you think we can interrogate her? I don't know. No one does. At these moments, all her instincts... are concentrated on forgetting... and deleting of her mind what happened. Maybe it's better like this. - Yes. - Come in. What is it? What happened? Beatriz. Calm down. Be calm. Beatriz. Calm down. Awake. Awake. Awake. Very good. Breathe. Breathe, Beatriz. Deep. It's gone. It's gone. Breathe... Breathe... Breathe... Certainly, Beatriz begins to awake. Her attitude is changing. She struggles, but I know she'll remember what happened. At the moment, she just insisted to someone come pick her up. It wasn't easy to deal with you in here. But I believe that at this moment a change could help her... in many senses. When will they be back? In a few days. Don't worry. I'll take care of her. Yes, I hope she doesn't make a mistake. I wish you the best. Thanks, doctor. Let's go? Good bye, Beatriz. Good luck. Just a fraction of a second, one millimeter away. This short is the way that keeps her away from death. Sometimes, she feels the temptation of giving a step forward to prove. It's so easy to die...
