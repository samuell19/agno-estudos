Teo's Flight I know it'll be a birth like any other. But you know me, Doctor; every time I panic. Don't worry. I understand. I'm glad you've called me. It means I still have your trust... although I'm a retired old man now. "Old"? You, Doctor?! Are you kidding me? Let's go. Relax. Relax. That's it. That's it! Good! Good! Hey! - Hi, Teo. Look. Do you like him? - Yes, he's beautiful! He's a wonderful specimen. Now he'll take his first steps. - Really? - Yes! He's not going to take a year, like you did, to learn to walk! - Come on! - Careful! Easy, easy! Relax! Be good, okay? Here you go. I'm sorry, Teo, for not coming to get you. I hate to break my promises. Giacomo was afraid something could go wrong, and asked me to come here with urgency. We can leave him alone, now. Let's go. - Let's all have a drink now! - Yes, good idea! Let's celebrate! You're happy today, Doctor! Definitely! You can say that again, my friend. You know, I really like my job. Every time I see a creature being born, I feel an indescribable emotion, even though I should be used to it. In your job, you must have seen a lot of foals being born. Oh, many! It must be a beautiful thing. It's a wonderful, unique thing. A miracle. It's a masterpiece. That's why I wanted you to come, too, and see the birth. But that rascal was in a hurry to come into the world. Maybe next time. I'm really glad that Giacomo called me. You know, everyone loves me around here. Very much. They think highly of me. And do you know why? Because I've always done my job with dedication and love. When you're older, you'll understand better what I'm saying. Here we are at Grandma Elisa's. End of the trip. - The bike is heavy. I'll take it. - Don't worry, I'll take it. Are you crazy? It's too heavy for you. Careful! - Welcome, dear Doctor. - Good morning, Mrs. Elisa. How are you? - Hi, Grandma. I'm going for a ride. - Hi. Did you make it in time? No, he had already been born. You should see how beautiful he is! - I'm going to Bennie. - OK, but don't be late. - Let's go inside. We must celebrate. - We must celebrate... what? The bank sent me the documents I was waiting for. I can finally break ground. - And for that, I must thank you. - Oh, it was nothing! Bennie! Hi, Bennie. How are you, today? Don't eat those leaves; they're bad for you. Look what I've brought you. Come on. Come out. I've brought you some carrots. They're good, aren't they? I always bring you the best things, because you're my best friend. I love you very much. I'll always take care of you. Bye, Bennie. See you later. Hi, little one! How soft you are! Your food is coming! Yes, yes, okay. Don't worry, Franca. "Mom, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've made an important decision: "I want to bring Teo to live in the city with me." - Are you sure it's good for Teo? - "Sure! He'll be fine in the city." - I'll try to prepare him. - "Good, prepare him." - We'll talk about that when you come, OK? - "Sure." Say hello to her for me. - "Sorry, I have to go now." - Dr. Cuccia says hello. "- Is he there? Hi!" - Yes, he's here. - We're celebrating the good news. - "Don't forget to talk to Teo." - Okay. - "Bye, then." - Bye. - "See you soon." I haven't seen Franca for quite some time. - Is she okay? - Yes. Is there something wrong? Franca has decided to take Teo to live with her. She wants him to attend middle school in the city. You're surely going to miss a good company. You're a lucky grandmother, you know? Teo is a special child. Right. That's what worries me. Teo is too special a child. I'm afraid the impact with society won't be beneficial at all to him. He's a child who needs a lot of love around him. He needs to be understood. Oh, I'm sure Franca won't fail to give him all he needs. No... Franca won't, of course. But what about others? Will they make an effort to understand him? Come on, don't be sad. Grandma didn't want to tie you, but you're always causing damage! Here. Teo, are you here? Angelo! Tell me I'm not dreaming. Is that really you? Of course it's me! How are you? How are you? You're already here... You said it'd take at least a week. Yes, a week if I had had surgery. But the doctor misdiagnosed me. It wasn't appendicitis. I just had indigestion, after eating all those plums. Do you remember? Well, it's better that way. You're lucky. Where are we with the raft? Have you continued building it? No, I haven't. I was waiting for you to come back. - Tomorrow we'll resume our work, then. - Okay. Come in, Teo. Your Grandpa Giuseppe was a great man, you know? You would have liked him very much. Too bad you never met him. - Yes, he was really a great man. - Like my father. I've never seen Dad. How come there's not even a picture of him? - Come on, eat. - I'm not hungry anymore. - Do you want some cheese? - No, thanks, Grandma. I'm full. Don't make her beg you. You know, Teo, the more you eat, the faster you grow up. Madam, I'm going to lock all doors and windows. I'll clear the table once I've locked them all. Are you afraid someone might kidnap us? Mrs. Elisa, these days, one never knows. Oh, I forgot. Your mom called. She said she'll call back. - Why would she have called? Did she tell you? - She wanted to hear from you. Every once in a while, she wants to hear from me, too. Teo, Teo... Am I wrong, or are you being mean to Mom tonight? No, I'm not being mean. But is it true or is it not true that she never has a day to visit us? I haven't seen her in two months, but she always has an excuse ready. I don?t even feel like I have a mom. Yes, you're right. But you know how busy your mom is. She hasn't come yet because she's busy, not because she doesn't love us. Your dad is far away, and she's working for you, too. To provide for your needs. - You have to understand. - Right... It is always I who have to understand. "Today I went to see the rabbit again. "I gave her some fresh carrots. "I also promised her that, when Dad gets back, "I'll ask him to take me to Africa, "and I'll ask him to let me take her, too. "Who knows if there are rabbits in Africa... "Maybe the climate is not suitable for them. "But living here is nice, too. "And so is swimming in the river every day, "playing in the water, and then lying in the sun, "where nobody can see me. "Telling the sky and the clouds about my big dream: "to leave, to take flight. "To be free, like a beautiful bird with light and fast wings, "and fly high, shining like a plane; "and go far, maybe... "to Africa, to my father." Teo? Teo! Do you think I'm your slave? Come on, get up, or we won't finish the raft by tonight. Tomorrow we'll have to leave no later than 7:00, or we won't be able to get to the swamp at 10:00. - No, tie that one. - Okay. - As soon as we get there, we'll have breakfast. - I've managed to get some salami. - You'll take care of the rest, won't you? - Sure. I'll also bring a plastic zipper bag. We'd better put everything in it. It'll be an unforgettable adventure. Maybe even Columbus started like us. Maybe. - With a raft like this, we could even brave the sea - Yes, sure. - Let's tie these inner tubes tighter. - Right. What's the matter? So? - Can't you sleep? - No. - Shall I tell you a story? - Yes, "Grandma Rabbit". I've told it a thousand times. You're a big boy, now. Okay. After all, even grown-ups like to be told a story, every now and then. Once upon a time, Grandma Rabbit lived with her family in a large poplar forest. One night, Grandma Rabbit, who had lingered longer than usual in the forest, far from her den, noticed some men with big rifles walking stealthily in the dark. One of them said: "The master said that, if we don't get him some wild rabbits, "this time he won't let us get away with it." Careful! Easy. Mind the steps! - Why don't we drag it? - Dragging it would be worse. We have to hold it up, or it'll get stuck in the ground. But it's heavy. And it's slippery here. OK, let's try. Let's turn it on its side. - Easy. - It's slipping out of my hands! Careful! Wait. We've made it. Down. Easy. Easy, easy! There we go. Get on, quick! I'll pass you an oar. - Push it against the riverbed to keep the raft still. - I'm on. Get on, too. It's done. Let's go! If we're lucky, we'll discover some unknown bird. Or some other strange animal. I wish! It would be wonderful! - Would you like that? - Of course I would. I can't wait to discover some animal or plant no one has ever seen before. - We've arrived. That's the mill. - It's dangerous here. We have to get past the sluice by land. Let's try to stop the raft against that shrub sticking out of the water. Come on, let's get closer. Come on, we're almost there. Oops! Teo, I'm coming. Grab my arm. Come on. It's drifting away! Come on, climb up. The raft! Come on, run! - We have to stop it before it gets to the sluice! - There's no way we can stop it! Poor raft! Why did you jump off the raft like that? Look! I hurt myself! Let me see. Come on, it's just a scratch! Once home, we'll disinfect it and bandage it. It's stinging! I'm sorry about the raft. It was a true masterpiece. - All we can do is go home now. - Yes, let's go. You're right; I was a fool to jump off the raft like that. Next time, we'll build a much lighter one, and we won't have any problem, you'll see. Please don't tell anyone what happened. If my father finds out, I'll be in trouble. My lips are sealed, you can count on me! You know, Michele, I'm not very good at these things, but I eventually convinced the bank manager. - I've made it. - And by yourself! You should be proud, Mom. That's not what I meant. I'm very happy the bank has granted this loan for the renovation. Maybe we could get our farm going again. Excuse me, isn't this farm too big for you to live in alone? It's certainly not my fault. I have 3 children and, sometimes, I don't even know where they are. Besides, over the years, one has to learn to live with loneliness. Yes. I?ve managed to do that. It must be hard to get by like this. Work is great company. Since my husband passed away, I've done it all on my own. How many sacrifices! Children grow up too fast. In the blink of an eye, they're already grown and far away. By the way, I hope you're considering giving me a grandchild. You've been married for some time now. It seems the task of grandmothers is to ask their children to give birth to some kids. But there's still plenty of time for that, Elisa. Don't you agree? Maybe for you, who are very young. But not for me. With a second grandchild, you'd have less time to take care of the house. Mom... Your wife still doesn't understand how important this house is to me. - And to our family. - Mom... Mom... try not to misunderstand her. Enrica, you know, Mom... Enrica didn't make herself clear. She didn't mean that. You're wrong. Clearness is one of Enrica's qualities. Hey! - Hi, Uncle Michele. - Hi, Teo. What have you been doing? You're all wet! Nothing, Grandma. I'll explain later. Come here! Wow, you've grown up a lot! This country life is really good for you! - Hi, Teo. - Hi, Aunt. - You're so dirty. Get changed. - Okay. How cute! Franca is very lucky to have you taking care of her child. "Lucky"? How can a mother who lives far from her son be lucky? She wouldn't be lucky if he were a normal child. But Teo... Teo? Teo is a normal child! An extraordinary child, full of qualities you're unaware of. I don't doubt that. But he's certainly not the ideal child. - Why? What does he lack? - You don't need me to tell you; it's obvious. - Enough, Enrica! - Why? Did I say something wrong? Jesus Christ, stop it! - Mom... - Madam! Mom! Do you feel unwell? Mom... - We'd better lay her down. - Help me take her to her bedroom. Come, Mom. Mrs. Elisa, what happened to you? I can't leave you alone for a minute. - How are you? Are you feeling better? - I'm fine, now. Thanks. - Can I go now? - Yes. I'm going, then. Excuse me, Dr. Cuccia... Don't get me wrong, but... Wouldn't it be better if Mom were examined by a physician, by a specialist? Don't worry, Michele. Dr. Cuccia knows his stuff. He knows what my problem is. Your mother has only one problem: her heart, which sometimes acts up. She needs some rest and a lot of quiet. Anyway, if you want to ask a specialist, he'll tell you the same thing. Elisa, you must remember to take the drops, tonight, before bedtime. Tomorrow morning I'll come by to check on you. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Good night, Doctor, and thanks. - Enrica, please see the Doctor out. - Yes. Why have you never told me about it, Mom? You should have informed me of such a thing. Come on, get up. It's not that bad. It's not like I'm dying. Besides, you have your own problems, too. Mom, I want to apologize for what Enrica said earlier. Sometimes she says things she doesn't mean. - Try to understand her. - That's what I've tried to do; but maybe I'm too old, Michele. Come on, don't be silly! You're not old at all. It's just that, when we talk about children, Enrica always loses her temper. Maybe it's because, after all this time, we haven't had any yet. You, in the city, are always in a rush, and forget what really matters in life. Maybe you're right, Mom. Of course I'm right. If you try harder, you'll manage to have a beautiful child, you'll see. Okay, we'll try to follow your advice. We can spend the night here, if you want. Don't worry. I'm fine now. Are you sure? Of course I'm sure! If you want to stay for the night, I'll be glad, really. - But you mustn't feel obligated. - No, Mom! "Grandma felt unwell tonight. "Fortunately, Dr. Cuccia came here. "Uncle Michele's wife must have upset her. "Every time he comes to visit us with his wife, "Uncle Michele doesn't stay long. "And Grandma is always in a bad mood afterwards." - Hello? - "Hi, Mom." - Hi, Franca. - "Is Teo there?" - Yes. - "Put him on." Wait. I'll call him. Teo! Come downstairs; Mom's on the phone. Teo, did you hear me? It's your mom. Hello? "Hello, Teo, it's Mom. How are you?" - I'm fine, Mom. - "I really wanted to talk to you. "In case Grandma hasn't already told you, I'll come and get you this weekend. "School starts in 15 days; we need to organize. "And then we can also spend some time together." "Hello?" "Hello? Can you hear me, Teo?" "Hello?" Teo? - "Hello? Is that you, Mom?" - Yes, Franca. What happened? "I wish I knew! "I was telling Teo I'd come and get him, "but he hung up. What's wrong with him?" I knew he'd react like that. Now I'll talk to him, and I'll try to convince him. "See you tomorrow." - OK. - "Remember: I'll arrive in the morning." - OK. - "Bye, Mom." - Bye. Hey, Teo! What are you doing here, still in your pyjamas? What is it? Are you angry? My mother called. And what did she say? That I have to move to the city. - To the city?! - I don't want to. But you'll come back to see me. Besides, we'll talk on the phone often. And, if you don't come to me, I'll come to you, I promise. I don't want to go. I don't give a damn about living in the city. Teo? Teo, where are you? Maybe we'd better go back. Your grandma is calling you. Teo, I need to talk to you. Well, see you later. I'm off. Bye. - Bye, Angelo. - Goodbye, Mrs. Elisa. Come. We need to talk. I perfectly know what this means for you. But you need to think about the future. In the city you'll have many experiences you couldn't have here. Important experiences, precisely because they will be different from those you've had so far. And, every time you come back here, it will look nicer, and different. But why should I leave? I'm fine here. Maybe you're afraid. That's natural. When baby birds leave their nest for their first flight, they're very afraid, you know? They're so comfortable in the warmth of their nest. But then, when they return to it, they're happy. Really. How much is this? - Come on, eat it! Don't worry. - Thank you. - Ah, Mrs. Elisa! Come, come. - Good morning, Doctor. Have a seat. - Can I offer you something? - No, thanks. I'm looking for Teo. Have you seen him? Don't worry. Where could he be? He must be around here, somewhere. Thank you. - How's your heart? - Fine, thanks. Then a drop of this will certainly do you good. Andrea, bring some wine for the lady, too. Coming right up. I like it when there's the market in the village. It's a pity that it's held only once a week. Excuse me a minute, Doctor. I'll be right back. The wine, Dr. Cuccia... Grandma... - How about some cotton candy? - Excellent idea. A large piece of cotton candy, please. No, give me two pieces, both large. One for me, too. "Last night I dreamed about Dad. But I can't remember his face anymore. "In this dream, he's handsome, tall. "I'm visiting him in Africa, where he works. "He's an important man, a great naturalist. "He promises me that, when I'm older, he'll bring me to live with him, "so I, too, will be able to study those animals I've only seen in pictures. "I really love my grandma and my rabbit. "But I wish my dad and mom came here to live with me. "Grandma always says Dad and Mom love each other very much, "but how can they, if they live far apart and never see each other?" Mom? - Franca! - Hi, Mom! - You're already here! - How are you? - How are you? - Fine. Where's Teo? He's around here. So, have you convinced him to move to the city? It is you who have to convince him. You just have to be patient. You have to understand: he's lived here for 10 years now. The country, the animals... are his life. I understand, Mom. But Teo's a big boy now. Don't you think it's right for him to go to live with his mother, in a nice apartment? He'll get used to it, you'll see. At least I hope so. What worries me is how you're going to balance your work commitments... and the need to spend time with your son. Mom, nowadays, half the people in the world are in my same situation! When I'm busy with work, I'll find someone who can take over for me. Problem solved. I've hired a sitter for Teo. Teo doesn't need a baby-sitter. He needs a lot of love. He misses his father very much. And you'll have to be both his mother and his father. I'll manage... just like all the women who have managed to raise a child without a man's help, since the world began. No, Franca. It's not as easy as you think. Teo is different from other kids. Why don't you say, clearly, that my son is a misfit? Never say that again. Your son... is simply wonderful. "Today I told the clouds about my big dream. "I told them I'd like to leave, take flight, "become a beautiful bird, with light and fast wings, "and fly high, free and shiny, like a plane. "I'd like to fly away, higher and higher, and get to Africa, to my father." You're right, Mom. One must be proud of a son like Teo. I often wonder if we've done the right thing not telling him the truth about his father. Oh, here's my young man! Well, don't you have anything to say? - Aren't you happy to see your mom? - Yes, Mom. - I missed you so much, you know? - I'll make you something to eat. I get it: you're happy to see your mom, but you don't want to leave this place, right? It's not like we're going to the ends of the Earth! Teo, look: this is your personal bag. You can pack all your things in it. Hurry! Go and fill it up. Come on! We're leaving right after lunch. - Do you need some help? - You never cease to amaze me. - Don't tell me you've learned to cook. - Well, yes, I've learned a thing or two. Gosh, time flies! Why are you in such a hurry? I have to be in the city early in the morning; I have a business appointment. Aren't you staying for the night? At least tonight. I'm sorry, Mom; I really can't. Come on, you visit me so seldom.. You only think about work. Okay, I'll stay. Thank you. So you're about to leave... That's too bad. Yes, in a bit. - Did you see Dr. Cuccia? - No. Will you take care of the animals? Yes, I'll take care of them. Don't worry. - Including the rabbit? - Yes. - Don't forget. Bye, Angelo. - Bye, Teo. Come back soon. And let's keep in touch by phone. Drive safely. And call me, when you arrive. Try to be there for Teo. Don't leave him alone. - He needs you. - Yes, don't worry. But where is he, now? I'm late. Here's Dr. Cuccia. He's come to say goodbye to you. Look who's here! Hey, Franca! Nice to see you, at last. So, how are you? - Good morning, Elisa. - Good morning. So, how does it feel to see the places of your childhood again? No special feeling. As usual. I thought as much. You're a city woman now. - When are you leaving? - Now, if Teo shows up. I've been waiting for him for an hour. These places obviously give him a different feeling than they give to you. Yes, but I'm already late. Maybe he's around here. Let's try to call him. Teo? Teo? No, Mom, it's useless. Teo needs to understand he can't always do what he wants. Come on, Franca, don't be angry. What are you worried about? Our Teo will be here any minute, you'll see. - While we wait, why don't you offer me a good cup of coffee? - I'd love to. Come. - Your coffee is always special, madam. - Thank you, Doctor. Teo really does what he wants! - It's as if I didn't exist for him. - There's no reason to be angry. Mom, please! There's no need to always find an excuse for Teo. We should have already left. Period. I have 3,000 things to do in the city. You have no idea... Listen, Elisa... I'm going to look for him. I'll be back as soon as I can, Bennie. Don't worry; Angelo has promised me he'll take care of you. Angelo is nice, you know. He won't let you want for anything. Bennie, I love you. Try to forgive me. I don't want to leave you, but, unfortunately, I have to go and live with my mom in the city. I'm sorry. Teo, your mother's waiting for you. I don't want to leave. There you go. Well, dear Franca, it was really nice seeing you again. I'm being sincere. And I hope we meet more often now. Right, Teo? See you soon, my friend. And don't worry about your animals' health. Count on me. Thanks, Doctor. Bye, Mom. And don't worry. Bye. Call me, when you arrive. And drive safely. Okay. Be well! Let's hope for the best. Yeah, it'll be all right... So? Hello? Yes, Mom. It's all right. We'll be there in a few minutes. He's very calm. He's fallen asleep. Yes. Don't worry, Mom. I'll call you tomorrow. Bye. Oh, finally home! Bring your bag inside, while I turn on the lights. Marika? Marika, we're home. (with a German accent) Ja, I'm coming. Here you are! - Good evening, madam. - Hi. - Welcome. I hope you had a good trip. - Yes, thanks. Teo, this is Marika, who'll take care of you. This is my son, Teo. - Good evening, Teo. - Good evening. - Any phone calls for me? - Nein, no calls. Good timing! They must have heard me arriving. - So? - I'm fine. Hello? Ah, yes... Hi, Giulio. What's the matter? Listen... Wasn't it at 5 p.m.? Okay, yes. I'll be there. Okay. See you tomorrow. Thanks. Bye. Good night. Teo, now I'll show you your room, we'll put all your things in order, then we'll have something to eat and go to bed. OK? - Come, let's go to your room. - Let me take your bag. Thanks. Did you sleep well, Teo? Good morning. Move over a bit. Today is your first day in the city. Breakfast in bed. But don't get used to it! Good morning, Marika. My young man is awake! - Hi. Did you sleep well? - Yes. What a nice breakfast Marika has made for you! Congratulations, my dear. Today will be a tough day. I'm late and I still have to get myself ready. This afternoon Marika will show you around the city, you'll go for a walk, and then we'll have dinner together tonight. - Have fun! Bye. - Bye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, madam. Have a nice day. Thanks. Hurry, schnell, we're going for a walk. I'm from northern Germany. It's still summer here, but it's so cold up there! Brr! - Will you go back to your country? - Ja, when university classes end. Come on, let's run to that store! There it is! We've arrived. Are you coming in with me, Teo? - No, I'll wait here. - As you wish. Teo, it's late. Aren't you tired? What time is Mom coming home? I don't know. But go to bed; I'll wait for her, if you want. Teo! You're still up. Is it all right? - Hello, Marika. How did it go? - He behaved very well. Thanks for everything. - I'm going to bed, then. - Yes. - Gute Nacht, Teo and madam. - Good night. I'm sorry. I'm late. What are you watching? Something interesting? Do you like it so much? Let's go to bed. Come on! May I come in, Teo? Yes, come in. Gosh, how you've grown! And what a handsome young man you've become! Are you angry? My first day as a mom has really been a disaster, hasn't it? Come on, Teo, don't be so mad at me. Do you forgive me? I'm sure we'll be good together. I promise. Besides... I want to be a nice mom. I love you so much... Sleep, now. Stop it! Come on, stop it! You're really an idiot! Stop it! Quiet, kids. Now I'm going to call the roll. Davide Costa. Present. Sara Perino. Present. - Carlo Rochi. - Present. - Marco Darici. - Present. - Francesca Forte. - Present. Matteo Sarti. So, who is Matteo Sarti? I'm Matteo Sarti. Don't be afraid; I don't bite! Come on, run! Run, come on! Don't push! Come on, run! You were pushing me! Come on, catch me! Sarti, I'll see you this afternoon to play football. - Hi, Teo! - Hi. - So, how did it go? - Fine. - I see you've made some friends. - Yes, a classmate has invited me to play football. That's great! I don't know if I should go. Of course you should go! It's a way to get to know them better. Tonight, you'll tell me: "One of them was amusing, another was unpleasant, "another always wanted to be right..." It's funny, isn't it? Yes, maybe you're right. Come on, come on! Go! Come on, pass it! Pass the ball! Come on, Matteo! Come on! Go, Matteo! Come on, shoot! Shoot! Goal! Come on! - Come on, Matteo! - Come on! Goal! - It's not valid. - It's a goal! I didn't touch the ball! It's not valid! Why are they leaving? We were playing so well. You... Where did you come from? I'd better go home. Make way! Come on! We're going to the arcade. Are you coming, too? Why not? Great! I've scored 5,500 points! - Stop it, you're making me mess up! - Sorry. "Sorry", my ass! Hey, guys, we'd better leave. Come on, let's go. Marco! - "Hello, who is this?" - Hi, Grandma. This is Teo. "Teo, my child, how are you?" Fine, Grandma. I'm fine. But I miss you a lot. "I miss you, too. What about Mom?" She's never at home. She's always at work. "What about school and your classmates? Have you made some friends?" No... yes... I mean, I have got to know some of them. But I'm not able to... "Teo, it's just a matter of time. Within a few days, you'll make friends with everyone." No, that's not true. Grandma, I don't want to stay here. Everything's so bad here. I want to be with you. Mom's never with me. It's as if I didn't exist for her. "Don't say that, my child. You know your mom loves you." - No, she doesn't love me. - "That's not true. She's your mother." "I know, you don't see her much. But you must be confident." "You'll see, as the days go by, she'll spend more and more time with you." "It's late now. You know that good children go to bed early!" Right... Only children have to be good. - Good night, Grandma. - "Good night, Teo." Teo... Wait, Teo. What happened? Kids, today we'll cover a very interesting topic. We'll talk about mushrooms. We'll start by analyzing one of the most common: the Porcino mushroom. "The Porcino mushroom consists of a grainy base and a cap, "which is usually brown on the top and white on the underside." Rochi, pay attention! "Unlike the Field mushroom and the Caesar's mushroom, "which have a large number of radiating gills on the underside of the cap, "the Porcino belongs to the so-called 'tubular' mushrooms. "In the white mass, under the cap, we can see some thin tubes. "With a little patience, you can find..." "With a little patience, you can find some correspondences among mushrooms. "Proceed like this..." - Pass it. - No, pass it to me. Come on. - Come on! Here! - Pass it! No, this way. Here. Hi. I'm Teo. I know. - Why did you come to school only today? - I lived in another city. - My parents worked there. - My father, too, works in another city. Actually, in Africa. So far? And when do you see him? - How about walking home together, after school? - Where do you live? - Near you. - Near me? Really? Are you kidding me? - How do you know that? - I saw you leave your house, this morning. Ah, you saw me... - What's your name? - Elisabetta. - I'm off. - Here. I wrote everything down for you. Okay, madam. Don't worry. - Remember to pick up the dry cleaning. - Ja. Hi, Franca. - I guess you're surprised to see me. - Of course I am. What do you want? Can I come in? So? What do you want? What do you want?! Have you decided to reappear like this, after 10 years of silence? I've never disappeared. And, anyway, you were aware of all my decisions. So now I should thank you for your loyalty? Don't think I don't know how much I hurt you. Thank God, I got over it long ago. I want to see my son. Ah, His Lordship wants to meet his son, at last! After 10 years! - Please, Franca, don't make a scene, as usual. - No... If you want to see him, now, I can't stop you. It's your right. But there's something you need to know: Teo has suffered a lot from your absence. So I ask one thing of you: if you've come back here to be part of his life forever, fine; but if you just want to impress him with a noble gesture, then beat it and leave him alone! Our son doesn't need to suffer more than he already has! Listen: 10 years ago, I didn't have the courage to marry you and start a family. The most important thing in my life was my freedom. But it's different now. Are you sure? - The teacher is nice. - Well, yes. That lesson about mushrooms bored me to death, though. - It's there. I've arrived. - I know where you live! I'll see you tomorrow at school, okay? Bye. Bye. Excuse me. You're Matteo, right? Yes. I'm an old friend of your mom and dad's. Your parents are very lucky to have a child like you. Really. Bye... Bye, Matteo. The president himself called me into his office! It's a great satisfaction for you, isn't it? Yes. But, honestly, I almost expected that, because, after all, the report I had prepared was almost perfect. Franca, you always do perfect things. Come on, don't pull my leg! Come on! - Excuse me, I'm going to see who it is. - Yes. What are you doing there, all quiet? Huh? Don't you like my friends? Try to have fun. OK? Coming. - Giorgio! - Surprise! I can't believe it! You're in Italy. Good to see you! - Hi, sis. How are you? - Hi. Where are you coming from? - New York. - From New York? That's wonderful! - Come. - What is it, a party? No, it's just a dinner with some colleagues. Great. - And where's Teo? - Teo, come and see who's here! Teo! Hi! Uncle Giorgio. Are you happy? Look what I've brought you, young man. - How thoughtful of you! - Thanks, Uncle. - Come on, open it! - Come on! No, I'll open it later. Thanks. Do as you wish. - Shall we have a drink? - Sure. Come. - I've joined the Golf Club. - Golf... how boring! - Where is he? - Over there. Look. - Have you ever been to Rio? - No. - So, you were telling me... - About the house. I've also talked to Michele about it. And he agrees. He already has someone interested in the deal. Yes, I think it's a good idea. Sure. But... we have to talk to Mom about it. - You know the farmhouse means a lot to her. - It's her birthday in a few days. We'll all go there, and we'll talk to her. Don't you agree? Why are you so perplexed, Franca? What is it you're unsure about? Mom will come around, you'll see. - Because she can't live in that house alone. - Right. - Have I convinced you? - Yes, that sounds perfect. - Giorgio? - Enrica! - You haven't even said hello to me. - I'm doing it now. Better late than never. - You look wonderful, as usual. - Thank you. My pleasure. Stay in the neighbourhood. Can I trust you? Yes, trust me. I'll only be gone for a couple of hours at most. - Stay close, Teo. Bye. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Where are you going? - Nowhere in particular. I'm going. My mom's waiting for me. Bye. - Did you do your homework? - Yes, I did! Aren't you going to play football? No, I don't enjoy playing it. Kids argue too much, here. - So you haven't made any friends. - No. It's hard for me. I don't understand them. I don't like it here. I can't wait to go back to the country. Why? Are you going back? Of course, even if I don't know when. Do you really like living in the country? Yes. But when I grow up, I'll move to Africa, where my father works as a naturalist. I'd like to go to Africa, too. Are you from around here? Yes, why? You seem so different from other people. Yes, because you know only me. - Do I know you? - Yes, you know me. You'll get to know other people and things. We'll do it together, if you want. Together, we could invent a city that has both the beautiful things of the country... and the beautiful things of this city. Are you kidding me? No, Teo, I'm not kidding, I'm playing. - Don't you want to play? - Yes, I want to play! Let's play, then! Over there! Let's go! Hey, wait! Don't run so fast! Slow down! No! No! - Let go of me! - What is it, Teo? Is anything wrong? No... No. Listen, Teo, I have to go home now. - See you. Bye. - Bye. What's in there? A surprise for the Science teacher. - Come on, let us see it. - No. - What have you brought? Open it! - How beautiful! - Gross! "Beautiful"? It's really disgusting! Let us see it! Let me hold it. - Give it to me! - Careful! What are you doing? - Goal! - Leave it alone! You idiot, what have you done?! It's just a turtle! Come on! - Are you angry? - He's really stupid! Teo! What's going on? Where are you going? Wait! Was machst du? Teo, what are you doing with the bag? - Teo, tell me what's happening! - I'm going back to Grandma's! Mein Gott! Mrs. Sarti, please. Ja, it's urgent. Madam, this is Marika. I have a problem with Teo. I think he ran away from school. No, no, he's here with me. You'd better come, please. Thanks. Okay. - Marika, what happened? - Madam! - Where's Teo? - There. Teo, what are you doing? What's got into you? - I'm leaving. I can't stay here anymore. - What's going on here? - I'm leaving, I said. Let me... - You idiot! Darling... I didn't mean to... Please, take me to Grandma's. I can't take it anymore. I'm a bit embarrassed, sir. Not only for Matteo's behaviour, but, above all, for the Italian teacher's suggestion to take him to a psychologist. Matteo's obviously having some difficulty adjusting here. But considering him a misfit seems excessive to me. He's a child who needs to be understood. With a little patience, he'll manage to overcome these problems, you'll see. It is important that you be supportive of your son. - Thank you, sir. - Come, Matteo. I was telling your mother it's a really nice idea. Yes, I've decided to keep your turtle in the classroom with us. It will be the 21st pupil. Are you happy? But you'll have to take care of it, OK? And, if you help us with your experience of plants and animals, I'm sure this year we'll study Science in a serious way. Okay? Now go to class. - Thank you, sir. - For what? - For what you'll do for Teo. - Ah. Don't worry, madam. Take care. Nein, I said no. No, I'll never do that. This time I won't change my mind. No, Carlo, please! What are you talking about? That's not possible! It can't be done, I said. No, it's not possible, do you understand? Stop it! Don't you see how selfish you are? Try to understand! Stop it, I said! Stop it! Why are you crying? It's all right, Teo. Don't worry. Is it your boyfriend who's making you cry? You're a good child, Teo. Is your boyfriend mean? No, he's not mean. He's very sick. He's a drug addict. But I'm going back to my country now. And I'm taking him with me. So he'll finally stay away from drugs and bad friends. And he'll recover. He'll become good. "Marika went back to her country. "I'm sorry, because she was nice. "I hope everything works out with her boyfriend. "Mom is always very busy with work, "so she's hired a new girl. Her name's Luisa. "She speaks good Italian, but she's not nice with me. "Nevertheless, today she'll take me to buy the gift for Grandma Elisa. "It's her birthday in a few days, "and Mom has promised me that we'll visit her in the country." Mom, the country is really beautiful! Yes, sure, the country is very beautiful. But it's also a very boring place to live. After a while, you run out of things to do, don't you think? The city is better. The country's still more beautiful. By the way, how much longer until we arrive? Not much longer. Teo! Happy birthday, Grandma! - How I've missed you, Teo! - Tell me about it! Darling... - Hi, Mom. - Hi. He's missed you, too. - Hi, Teo. How are you? - Fine. See? He has become a big boy! He has really become a big boy. - Here's our young man. - I'll leave you alone. - How are you, champ? - Fine. I've brought him back to you, Mom. You want to grow taller than me, huh? How he's grown! - Let's get away a minute. - Is there a problem? Teo, go to see your animals. - But don't be late for lunch. - Okay. Did you really have to bring Teo? What could I have told Mom if I hadn't brought my son with me? I love you. I'm going. Bye. So... - Shall we go? - Yes. Bennie? Bennie, where are you? Why the long face? What's the matter? - Grandma, Bennie wasn't in her den. - She must be nearby. Don't worry; animals always return to where they have friends. Do you know I've almost managed to close that deal, Giorgio? - Really? - Yes. - How are things for you? - In New York I'm becoming more and more insufferable. I think I'll apply for a transfer. You're lucky. You can travel. He's really lucky, don't you think? Always travelling the world... - I'll be right back. - Okay. - Ladies and gents... - Look what a nice cake, Mom! - This calls for a toast! - How nice! - Happy birthday, Mrs. Elisa! - Thank you. - This cake is delicious, isn't it? - Uh-mm! - Do you like it? - It's very good. I want to sit next to you, Mom. Give me a kiss. Darling... - Now that we're all here, we have to tell you something. - Sure. It's the right time. Guys, what are these mysteries? What have you got to tell me? It's a once-in-a-lifetime deal. They've decided to expand the airport near here. - There's a lot of money to be made. - And you, Mom, can come to live in the city, maybe with one of us. And I'd feel much better knowing you're no longer here, all alone. Yes, Michele's right. Besides, you'll certainly be fine in the city, Elisa. Don't you have anything to say? Mom, it might not be a bad idea, considering your state of health, if you came to live in the city with us. You'd surely get better treatment. But... How can you be so obtuse as not to understand what this house means to me? I've lived my whole life here. To me, it means love, sorrows, joys, hopes, memories. I want to die here. It's a unique opportunity. It will never come again. I already know the right buyer. - He wants to turn this house into a hotel. - Giorgio's right. Mom, if we miss this opportunity, it's unlikely to come again. And you're willing to erase, destroy the memories of a lifetime for a handful of money? No, I'll never sell this house. Mom, don't take it like that. Think it over. When the buyer comes, you'll change your mind. The truth. I want the truth. You're trying to make all this look like an idea, but you've already decided everything. Come on, say it. Don't take it like that. I asked if you've already decided everything. Yes, Mom. And we've done it for your good. Teo? Teo! Teo! It's Angelo. Come on out. Hi, Teo. As soon as I heard you were back, I rushed here. What's the matter? Are you angry? - My uncles want to sell the house. - And what's your grandma going to do? They'll take her to the city, too. We'll end up never seeing each other again. Yes. No, I don't think your grandma will let herself be talked into it. What was that? Who's shooting? Hey! Hey, folks! - Giorgio, what happened? - Look what I've got! What's going on? What's the matter? Is something wrong, Mom? What have you done, Giorgio?! What have you done?! You've decided to start the work of destruction. Poor little animal. She was Teo's rabbit! Poor Teo! No? No! - Darling... - Let go of me! Teo? Bennie? Damn you! Damn you all! English subtitles by YRR
