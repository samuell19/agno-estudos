Good man. Genuinely good man. He did something for me which I'll never forget. He looked after my family. He looked after my sister and my brother-in-law while I was away. And that was a lovely gesture. A lovely gesture. And I've never forgotten. I learned a lot from the bloke. He's been all right. He's a good businessman. He's got a brain on him. But, you know, he surrounds himself with a bunch of goons. I wasn't going to be a goon. He was good to me, my family, my mum. He was good to everybody. What can I say about the man? It's like biting the hand that feeds you. Without him, who knows where I would have ended up? And yeah, I stood next to him in the dock, because he didn't do nothing wrong. And I'll say that to my dying day, that he never done nothing wrong. I think it's the biggest miscarriage of justice ever... ever happened in the history of er... Great Britain, really. One of them. I mean, we done a couple of things. We slapped a few people around. We looked after people. People treated us with respect. We treated them with respect. He's a very intelligent man, Charlie. He's a very, very intelligent man, but I think he got too big for his boots. And just... From what he done to me, I can't think anything more of him as being like an animal. He's a gentleman. He's a businessman and he's a gentleman. In the '60s, London was owned and ruled by two families. North of the river, the Krays. To the south, the Richardsons. Some movies portrayed these families as violent, stupid men who went round shooting or cutting anyone who got in their way. Bastard! Lying faggot! I'm going to tell you my story. So you make up your mind about what it was really like. I'm Charlie Richardson. Charlie. Get up! Get up! Charles Richardson, I'm arresting you. You're not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so, but anything you do say... Two very important things happened on the 30th July 1966. England won the World Cup with Kenneth Wolstenholme uttering those immortal words... Oh, fuck off. And Nobby Stiles jigging his way across the Wembley turf. But more importantly for me, 7 a.m., those bastards from Scotland Yard come knocking at my door and nicked me. One of you want to go downstairs, put the kettle on, eh? - I'll go. - Peters! Cunts. - Didn't matter though, cos I'd get off. - Gotta brush my teeth. - I always got off. - Out the way. It has taken 104 prospective jurors before we were able to decide on you 12. It is now up to you to decide the fate of one of the most notorious crime gangs in London. It will not be an easy task. You are about to embark on a case which may affect the future of the law in this country. Therefore I intend to inform you that for the duration of the case, you will be under surveillance. This means that plain-clothes police officers will shadow you to and from your homes. So that no improper approach may be made by anyone. We shall also be installing in each of your houses a special phone. This phone will have direct access to the police. Should any one of you or your families be approached by anyone regarding this case, please use the phone. Or if you're at all scared, also use the phone. The police will be there to give you assistance. What's that Charlie? - It's a boat. - It's nice, ain't it? It's better than nice. I'll get it. That's me. Me and my little brother Eddie. - How you going to do that, Charlie? - I don't know, but I'l get it. Eddie! Charlie! Come on! It all started here, southeast London. Just after the war. Things were tough. Tough for everyone. But we was happy as kids. - When's dad coming home? - When he gets here. - Where are you going? - Out. - I've got stuff to do. - Can I come? You take care of him, Charlie, you hear? Dad weren't around much, but Mum, God bless her, did the best she could for us. We made our own amusement and considered ourselves lucky, cos not only did we live above a sweet shop that my grandparents ran, we had the bomb sites to play in. - Tell me where we're going, Charlie. - Come on. I'll show you. Aaargh! Do you ever think we'll see Dad again, Charlie? Course we'll see him again! Don't you go saying nothing like that. As soon as his ship gets back, he'll be right over to see us. You'll see. What are we looking for, Charlie? This. Don't you think it's fucking marvellous, Eddie? I think it's fucking marvellous. I mean, metal, where it comes from. Under the ground for thousands of years. I think it's fucking marvellous. Tell me this. If it's that fucking marvellous, why isn't it bastard lighter? Cos it's metal, Eddie. It's kept us out of bother, ain't it, son? Charlie. That's my baby brother Alan. Smart kid. educated. Not like me and Eddie. He went to school. We promised Mum he wouldn't make the same mistakes as us. Are you Charlie Richardson? - Who wants to know? - I've got a lorryload of lead here. - They said you might buy it. - Is it knocked off? I don't know if it's knocked off, do I! Do you want it or not? - Do you reckon it's knocked off? - I don't know. Well, you should fucking know, shouldn't you? If it's off St Mark's, I ain't paying for it. Because that's rightly mine. I ain't just got round to collecting it yet. If it's from out of town, I'll have it. There's two geezers in long coats out here. Old Bill? I ain't fucking driving it in here, then, am 1? - Do you want me to have a word? - No. We look after the Old Bill out of our end. Don't worry. Bring it in. Alan. Yes, Charlie? Look, erm... I've been meaning to talk to you. I don't want you getting involved with the Old Bill, OK? I want you to run this business proper. See, me and Eddie, we er... Just keep your nose clean, OK? You keep Mum happy. Keep her happy, OK? Why don't you make me and Eddie a cup of tea, eh? Leave it out, Charlie, I don't want to be the tea boy. Oi. You heard your big brother. Two lumps in mine, not too much milk. Didn't take you long. I thought I'd see if everything's OK with our new entrepreneur. You've got a new delivery. Why don't you crawl back under a fucking rock, you scumbag? Eddie. Look, if the local police officer's looking out for us, it's only right that we should er... pay an interest in their funds, eh? You always was a smart one, Charlie. Yeah. Quickly. We've got to go, got to go! - Charlie? - I've got to go, Mum. Where's it gone, Charlie? Someone must have bought it. Who do you think bought it, Charlie? I don't know. Dad! Hey, hey, hey. How are you doing? How's my little Eddie? How's Charlie? Have you been behaving yourself, eh? Hello, Eddie, how have you been? Have you been good? - Yeah. - Have you? You been a good boy? Haven't you got big, haven't you? Scumbag Berman. Up until the last minute, he was in the dock with us. Then suddenly he decided to cross the line. I was called to take sandwiches to the office. When I got there, Charlie and Frank and Tommy Clark was there. This guy was sitting in a chair. When I looked again, I recognised the man as Taggart. I had to look twice. I mean his... His eyes and his nose and his ears were all swollen. His body was covered with marks. How did you feel when you saw him? Well, I nearly fainted. I said to Richardson, "Good God, what's this man done to end up like this?" Charlie was shouting and screaming. I was in a daze. I didn't know what I'd walked into. Could you leave the room? Yeah, but my feet wouldn't let me. It was all very tense. I-1 started walking to the door. Charlie told me to sit down and wait. Then Charlie told Taggart he wanted 1,200 quid. Your defence can be summarised in a few words. You had the misfortune to come across two crimes being committed. One, knocking Taggart about in an unlawful way. The other, demanding money from Taggart. Yeah. You were not there because you wanted to be there, or because you were a willing party by any chance. And your continued presence was not due to any desire to encourage what was going on, but was because you did not know how you could get away. Yeah. Mr Berman, would you tell me who the cheques were made out to? What? Oh, come on, Mr Berman. You remember the assault you walked into and which your feet wouldn't let you walk away from? Who were the cheques, which totalled £1,200, and which you say Mr Charles Richardson demanded with menace, made out to? Let me remind you. The cheques signed by Mr Taggart were made out to you, Mr Berman. What is it with him and that bloody boat? Leave it Charlie. Well, it's not right that he should get attached to things like that. Only leads to disappointments. Here, give us the boat. Don't you trust your old man? You should never trust anybody but your old man. Now, give us the boat. That's it. You like this boat, don't you? Yeah, it's nice. Did I tell you about the tides? - No. - No. Well, you see, Charlie, you don't want to do any work. Like carrying this. I mean, apart from there being little room for it in the car, I mean, you've got to lug this bloody thing all the way up there. Ain't you? So, now, you take the tides. You see, the tide, it goes from here, and it goes all the way to London Bridge. And it comes all the way back again. So, get your boat, put it in the water, and let it sail all the way up on the tide to London Bridge. And then we pick it up when we get there. - Do you want to do that? - No. Just put it in the water. It saves lugging the bloody thing about, don't it? Listen, don't you trust me? Go on. Set it in the water. That's it, that's it. OK, come on. I fancy a pint, I must say that. You're probably sitting there thinking, "Poor little bugger." But see, my dad taught me a valuable lesson that day. He taught me, you must never trust anyone 100 %. After all if he, the man I loved more than anything, could do this, what could all the other little toerags who came round kissing up to me in later years take from me in moment of weakness? They called this place a teenage correctional facility. Fuck knows what teenagers here ever corrected. All we ever did was dreamed up scams for when we got out. They put me in here to stop me nicking cars. I was a dab hand at pinching motors. From about 13, I always drove a decent jam jar. How are you going to do it, Charlie? But not being one who enjoyed being locked up, I decided to get out of the place. The thing is, if you're going to escape from any nick, you've got to use people you can trust. I used the only person I knew I could trust completely. After all, if someone's going to break you out, who better than your dad? It's about time. Where have you been? I'm sorry, Charlie. You're supposed to have been here an hour ago. - I know, but I got a bit delayed. - I told you to use a torch, not a lighter. You won't believe it. I couldn't find a bloody torch anywhere in the house. - Did you bring the car? - No. Don't get angry. I've got it all arranged, OK? It's going to be sweet now. Come on. Come on. It's going to be all right. No need to worry. There we go. There's all the sacks. That it? That's not enough, mate. I'll take the sacks back. I was 15 and I'd learnt the art of financial manipulation at an early age. Me and my mum's brother, Uncle Jim, were partners in business collecting sacks for farmers. - You could have given him a fair price. - Oh, fuck off, Jim. Don't tell me to fuck off, you little sod. This is my business as much as it is yours. It was his business and my lorry, SO We were partners. And we were doing very nicely, thank you. When I saw this building. And there it was. A fucking gold mine. Well, a shed full of air force scrap, to be precise. But I knew, I knew I could turn it into gold. So I made my Uncle Jim ring up the government and put in a bid for the lot. - You fucking do it. - Which he wasn't happy about. All right. That's all very satisfactory, then. All I need now is the cheque. Thank you very much. It's a pleasure doing business with you. Yes. Well, Charlie boy, you did it. You bought the whole buggering lot. Everything! All official. Yeah, until the poxy cheque bounces. Where do you think I'd get five grand from, Jim? So, you've got no answer? Your company just went into liquidation. I don't think you ever had the money. Now, I want that scrap returned. Do ya? That's it. I'm going to get the police in on this. All right. I'l tell you what, you find a buyer for the stuff, and we'll go down the middle on the profit with you. You come out smelling of roses and we have a little touch on the deal. Cheeky little bastard! Course, you could always go back and tell your boss what you done. Right. Well, just this once. Bless him. What choice did he have? Randall! Fucking stupid, ain't it? Fucking conscription. Waste of two fucking years, ain't it? Sit. Sign there. I mean, what is this fucking lot going to defend, eh? Richardson! / mean, come on, look at them. - Eh? - Shut the fuck up. Richardson! Prick. Stand up! Never sit down in front of an officer without permission! Sit down, Richardson. Sign there. Nah. I-I'm sorry. What did you say? I said fucking no. Stand up! You horrible little spastic! Fuck off, you cunt! What did you say? Are you deaf? As well as fucking ignorant? Corporal Barnes! Corporal Dickinson, arrest this man! Wait! Wait. Richardson, will you please sign this? It's the Official Secrets Act. See, that's the problem. I ain't going to keep no secrets. You'd knowingly give our secrets to the Russians? Well, yes, especially the fucking Russians. And anyone else who wanted to... fuck up capitalism. In this shithole of a country of ours. Are you a communist, Richardson? Fucking right I am. Look, I don't know if you're working your ticket here, but it would be a lot easier to do the two years quietly, keeping your nose clean. Itd be over in no time. Otherwise, you'd be sent to prison. ♪ LANCE ELLINGTON: A Certain Smile And that's what they did.

Those bastards nearly kicked me senseless. I still don't fucking get it. Here comes the driver now. Cheerio, then. So? Fucking wait! Hey, Frank. Here comes the car. I still don't get it. Look. See those geezers running the parking? They're having it off, son. See, when that geezer comes back for his car later, they're going to charge him a full day's parking. His car's only been in there a couple of minutes. What they do is, they take the cars and they park them on a local farm. So? So don't you think we ought to get in on this business? Hey, Frank. Here comes another one. OK, let's go. Can we have a word? Cyril Green. He worked for me. But like my old man said, you should never trust anyone. I'd just come out of prison. Charlie took me to a warehouse. It was where he interviewed reps when he was pulling in a long firm deal. A long firm deal? He'd start a company, buy a few bits and pieces from a supplier - pay cash at first, all up front. Toasters, kettles, that type of thing. We live in a tea-drinking nation, my friend. - Is this all guaranteed, is it? - Oh, fuck the guarantees. - This is shit, actually. - Oh, we'll shift it. And this lot'd feed the five thousand. About a hundred pieces in this one. After buying things regular for three months, the supplier would say... - Why don't you open an account, Charlie? - Are you sure? Well, we've been doing business long enough. And anyway, if we can't trust you, who can we trust, eh? Alison, make sure when we send Mr Hurst's goods that it's on account in future. Sure. I'l see you later, Alison. OK? She's a lovely girl, ain't she, eh? - Mr Hurst? - Yeah. Or Branch, or Collins. He'd open an account under any moody name. - By moody you mean an alias? - Yeah. So now he's got an account. But he still pays regular, on the dot, never misses. Now he's got the supplier's trust. ..spend £400 on you, eh? So when he rings up and says he's got a big overseas order, 2,000 pieces... At65... the supplier ships the gear in, then Charlie does a runner. It's called a long firm deal, cos it takes about six months to sort out. Before you know it, the stuff turns up in the markets, or tallymen sell it on the knocker. I met him another time. A bloke called me and Bradbury to Charlie's office. And what was the reason for visiting the office? We was taking him a bottle of whisky round. - Frank, look. - Charlie had Harris in for questioning. Had Mr Harris in for questioning? Sounds rather like the police. Charlie was the police. Anybody nicked anything, Charlie'd give 'em a slap. Told "em to fuck off up West, nick from prats who can afford it. - Anyway, the police all work for Charlie. - Strike that last remark. That is a matter of hearsay and is not for this court. Johnny, give him a drink. - This was the whisky you had brought with you? - Yes. What happened next? Then they all punched him. And they stripped him. Then what happened, Mr Green? Harris was screaming. Went on for about an hour. He threw up. I felt sick, too. They gave me a final warning. - Do you like that? - No. Do you fucking like that? Cos that's what you'll get if we find you nicking any of our money. Then Georgie Cornell walked in. George Cornell. A good pal. He died in 1965. Shot in the face by Ronnie Kray at the Blind Beggar pub in Stepney. I tried to talk to George, but he lost it. Lost it? Tipped me upside down on the chair, hit me across the head with a pair of pliers. Then he starts hitting me with the chair, and ashtrays, kicking me and pinching me. Then what happened? Er... Abit later on, Roy Hall turned up with a pot of tea. Tea? Who was it for? Well, them, I think. Then Cornell says to Hall... Roy, give Cyril a cup of tea. Someone poured the pot over my head. Hot boiling tea? Hot boiling tea. Then Hall made me sit on the floor. These men made a living out of making up stories. They can tell stories. That's what they've done. They've done very well out of it. He made me er.. keep my eyes open so I could watch what was coming. They punched me, kicked me, then Charlie made me take my shoes and socks off. So, if you choose to believe them, then you're a fool. They tried to break my toes. Couldn't do it properly. So they used pliers. Your Honour, Cyril Green himself is a prisoner on remand on a charge of fraud! Your Honour, I have been directed by the Director of Public Prosecutions that, at the appropriate time, an application would be made at Marylebone for it not to be proceeded with. I mean, do they have even one... one credible witness? I mean, look at this fucking Green. I mean, he's already doing time. What's all this now, like, "Not to be proceeded with"? You know what that means, don't you? He's done a fucking deal. That's what he's done. He'll say whatever they want him to to get out of doing his own fucking bird. You get Mottram up there. He'll prove to 'em that he's lying. He'll show that little cunt up as a liar. Calm down, Charlie. All in good time. Charlie? What can't I say about him? I mean, he changed my life. I mean, when I was a kid, you know, I lost my dad, when I was very young. There was only me and my mum, and whatever, you know? And... you know, he could have got me done by the police. And I was desperate, you know, for food, so I started nicking stuff from out his yard. And then, all of a sudden, he got hold of me, took me upstairs, give me a slap, I thought, oh, here we go - some old bugger's going to have a go at me. And he said to me, er... "Who do you think you are?" ..cunt, you know what I mean? And he laughed. And he asked me, and I said, "Well, my dad..." He thought my dad had run away. And I said, "No, no, he died on the railways", an' that. So he give me a job, clearing up round the yard, made sure everything was all right. And years later, I end up running a yard for him. Come on out, Charlie boy! I want to talk to you! Jesus fuck! What do they want? I'm warning you, Charlie! Now, that's Charlie Wilson. Before he became one of Ronnie Biggs' Great Train Robbers. And got 30 years inside for his efforts. Oh, shit! They've got shooters! Oh, fuck me! Fucking hell, Eddie! - Who's upset them? - laint Have you fucking upset them? Oh, shit! Don't look at me, Charlie. I don't even know who they are. Oh, you fat fuck, Roy! This ain't fucking funny, boys. - Shit! - Eddie, I got a good idea. Go and find out what's upset ‘em. - I'm not going out there! Let fucking Roy go! - Bollocks! Oh, shit! I ain't going out there, Charlie. Shall I get on the blower and get some help round here?

You prat. - Everything all right, officers? - We had a report of gunfire. Gunfire? No! We had an accident with an engine. - It blew up. - An engine did that? Yeah, I know. A fucker, ain't it? Oh, yeah. Charlie asked me to give you this. Says for you both to take your families out for a nice meal. Come on, Clive. Nothing here to see. You ought to get arrested, not me. - You fucked her. - Oh, yeah? Well, she opened her fucking legs. Get your fucking head down, or I'll cut it off, you silly cunt. That's you and me fucking square now. You've still got our shooters. Yeah, well, let's just say it's a little bonus for me not losing my fucking temper! All right? - All right? - Yeah. All right. Who wants a fucking drink, then? You fucking arsehole, Roy. James Taggart. I've got nothing to say about this bloke. He was already serving time. I was taken to a small office, where I was beaten and stripped. Frank Fraser picked up a wooden pole about two inches in diameter, three feet long. He started smashing across my body and head until it broke. Where did that come from? By this time, my body was a mass of blood. So was my head. And the walls and the floor of the office were spattered with my blood. I was made to clean up the mess with my own underwear. I wanted to remain conscious cos I knew that if I became unconscious... it might look different to people concerned and I... I assumed I'd become automatically a dead man. Then... Charlie came back, Eddie and a few other people. And when those other people came back in the room, did anyone ask you what had happened? No. Of course they didn't. Because this never happened.

Not in that water. Not in the Thames. Fat Jack Duval. Biggest con man you've ever seen. I decided early on it was better to have him work for me than against me. I met Charlie in The Astor Club. He offered me a job. I went to Italy for him to buy nylon stockings and then send them back over here. Now, this is Tommy Wisbey, one of our Great Train Robbers. He got 30 years. Jack "The Hat" McVitie. Silly sod. Murdered by Reggie Kray. Now, ifthe devil really could cast his net, right here in The Astor Club, he'd find every lowlife London had to offer. Politicians, lords, blue bloods and celebrities. You name it and they were here. And they were desperate, desperate to rub shoulders and spend a few minutes in the company of petty criminals like us. Us - the notorious tough men who weren't afraid to spill a bit of claret, using their bare knuckles. / got a job with an airline and Charlie found out. So we started buying tickets on credit and selling them on. And I went over to Italy. Bought tickets there. This went on for about three months. Weer. We must have owed about... oh, £30,000. It wasn't that easy and I had a bit of a rough ride, so I had to come back. I got a phone call from Charlie. He said, "Do we have to come and fetch you? Or are you going to come like a good boy?" Charlie gave me a dodgy passport to get me out of the country. I was frightened. ♪ MARK WYNTER: Venus In Blue Jeans Argh! ♪ She's Venus in blue jeans ♪ Mona Lisa with a ponytail ♪ She's a walking, talking work of art In the future, Jack, you fucking do what Charlie wants you to do. ♪ ..who stole my heart ♪ My Venus in blue jeans JIs the Cinderella I adore Now, listen. That's fucking bollocks. People say things like that. It's just looking for trouble. Really. mean, it's... Unsubstantiated bullshit. Is it right that, during your trial for the airlines' tickets fraud, Chief Constable McArthur gave evidence at your trial? Yes. He is the senior police officer in charge of the case, is he not? Yes. Itis as a result of what that senior officer said that you were treated leniently? tis for a judge to decide how a defendant is treated. I suggest the evidence you have given is a tissue of lies. That you have been a liar by profession and you are a liar in this court. Things in Joburg were beginning to happen. I had to bring in some of the boys to help me with the business. Let's get out of here. Charlie? But that fucking Aubury just kept on. What the fuck's he want? Let's go. I'm sick of this shit. Let me ask you something. If I did all that stuff they said I did, why wouldn't I give this prat Aubury a slap? I mean, I knew he was trying to have me over. So, what are we going to do about Aubury? I don't know, Charlie. You make me fucking sick. Do you know that? You've done all the work. I put up the money. What has he done? What is the fucking matter with you? You just want to give it to that fucker. He's done nothing, Richard. Well... there might be a way. We have to renew our claim every year. It's called repegging. If we don't repeg, someone else will put their peg in and claim it. OK, let's just say. Let's just say you forget to repeg. I come along... I peg the land. That's going to make all the land mine, right? Then we've got no partners. That's the way it works. There you go, Mr Waldeck. All legal. The mining rights of the land in Mr Richardson's name. - Are you happy with it? - It purrs like a tiger. Thank Mr Richardson for me. Here you go. Anything else? I could do with some new plant - trucks, rollers, diggers - if you've got any lying around. I'll see what I can do, Richard. So, back in London, what do you know?

She was putting it around a little bit too much. And with Johnny Bradbury, a pain in the arse at the best of times, I wasn't happy. Charlie! Charlie! Frank and me's got a deal we want to talk about. - Frank and me's got a deal... - I heard you. I heard what you said. Not leading my nipper astray, are you, Frank? I don't want to hear he's been hanging judges by the neck on some common. That cunt deserved everything he got. How many good men topped themselves because of him? I wish I'd killed him now. I can understand that, Frank. Pass the rag, Eddie. Me and Frank's going in on the fruit machine business. Why would you two want to get into fruit machines, eh? We've got good money coming in from the parking. All the yards are doing very nicely. Jesus, last week, Roy had the whole of Trafalgar Square closed off, getting that boiler out. Imagine that, eh? The government giving us, the Richardsons, contracts. How good do you want it to be? Cos you know, we don't even have to break into the fucking buildings any more, do we? Cos the Labour Party opened the fucking doors for us. So, let me ask you. Why would you want to get into fucking fruit machines? OK. - Charlie... - OK, Eddie. You two want to get into fruit machines, that's your business, not mine. But Charlie Richardson is not in on this one. We're not dropping the Old Bill. Now, hang on, son. Now I know you're fucking mad. - Frank, have a word. - He's the brains. We're going to do this right. Have books and everything. So, if we're not breaking the rules... Eddie. Eddie. Jesus, son. Didn't I teach you nothing? Nice work. Benny Coulston was in the nick when the Old Bill offered him a deal to give evidence against me. Well, I was held for six hours. Cheers. Argh! Let's take his teeth out. Come on, Frank. I can't get the fuckers out. Let me have a go. Argh! And what was Mr Richardson doing all this time? He was smoking, drinking, laughing. He was enjoying it. He put a gun on the table and he asked me what happened to the £600 he said I'd taken. I said I didn't know nothing about it. Then I was hit over the head with a lump of wood or metal. Frank Fraser hit me about the head with a chisel. Then Charlie told 'em to take me outside and give me a bath. - No! No! - Don't fucking scream. Bath time. Fiction. Again, out of the imagination of one of these liars. You know, one of these con men. / was bleeding. I was pouring with blood. And Charlie went outside and he comes back in... with an electric fire. Do you like this? You like this, yeah? Argh! Hey? Do you feel that? Argh! Hey? What's this? Hey? Do you like this? Do you like this? Hey? Argh! Then I was wrapped up in the tarpaulin and two, like, 14lb weights were added. I thought they were going to throw me in the river. Did you, when you made your first statement in hospital, mention any of the names present here in court today? No, sir. Yet this year, when you were already in prison on another charge, the police visited you and you changed your statement, and named those we see in the dock. Mr Coulston, you say that the toes on your right foot were smashed. Did you scream or shout out when this assault was carried out? I can't remember. You can't remember. Tell me, did you suffer any other injuries during this alleged attack? Yeah, my tooth was pulled out with a pair of pliers. And did you visit a dentist? No, sir. Pardon? No! Then what happened? I was given a new shirt. Then I was driven home by Eddie. That was very nice of you, Eddie. These men, who so violently beat you, gave you a new shirt and drove you home. I see. Hello? It's for youl! Yeah, hello? Charlie. Hey, Richard, how are you? You'd better get out here quick. We've got some trouble with the natives. So, having got Richard's phone call I drove out to the mine. Anyone here? I'm Charlie Richardson. I own this site. Hello? It's me - Charlie! Looking for Tommy! Can you help? Is anyone fucking here? Bwana! Hello. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck! Who wants something, eh? Who wants it first? Hello, Charlie boy! Fuck this for a lark. How about a nice cup of tea? God bless you, guv. You fucking arsehole, Tommy! Can't you take a joke? Stop it! - Tommy! - Watch it, Charlie! That nearly fucking hit me! Charlie! Only fucking arsing around, mate! - Get off! - Oil Come here! Pack it in! You earned that, son. Yeah. Cheers, guv. - You should have seen your face. - Don't worry, you'll get yours. So, what's all the aggro, then? It's a bit embarrassing, Charlie. Don't tell me one of you two has knocked up the chief's fucking missus. That's what we thought. All these black geezers turned up. - We thought we were goners. - And? It wasn't because I was shagging the women, Charlie. I was plating 'em. - He's been sticking his tongue up them. - Apparently, Charlie, blokes don't do that here. Blokes don't do that back in Camberwell, pervert. I've just driven 200 fucking miles because you like a bit of cunnilingus? Stop fucking doing it! - Its all right. I taught 'em all how to do it. - I can see that. Look. The smile on their faces. I should have got here earlier. Is that Bradbury? Who's he with? He's having a laugh, isn't he? What's he doing? All right, Charlie? - Hey, Johnny, what are you doing here? - Just having a bit of fun. - Having fun, are you? - Yeah. You fucking shit! Eh? Fuck off! In a funny sort of way, I think Richard Waldeck set me up. I think he wanted me to catch his old lady, so I'd give Bradbury a slap. It didn't matter cos I couldn't help. There was nothing any of us could do to keep that prick Johnny in line. Get out of here! Both of you! And you, you slut! ♪ LULU: Shout ♪ We-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ell ♪ You know you make me wanna shout...

I saw the look in that copper's eye. You must be somebody powerful. It's not me, Charlie. Meet General Van Den Bergh, the most powerful man in South Africa. So you've met my niece. Has she taken you to her bed yet? Don't worry, Mr Richardson. I know she needs company. That waste of space husband of hers can't keep her happy. Oh, I see. He took you to meet Mrs Mandela. Such a libertarian. If only the blacks knew she works for me. - Charlie, meet me back at the hotel, OK? - Are you OK? - I'm sorry about that. - It's OK. How long are you intending to stay in my country, Mr Richardson? Your country? You're in the headquarters of BOSS, Mr Richardson. The Bureau Of State Security. We let the government know what they need to know. We keep the blacks in their place and the whites in control. As the head of BOSS - yes, it is my country. There's not a thing happening in South Africa that I do not know abot... including you. Anti-apartheid, Pan-African Congress and the ANC. What about them? They all have offices in London. So does the Co-op. I assume with your... how should I put it, business contacts, you could get into these offices and relieve them of a little information? I don't have a problem with blacks. Nor have I. Consider it as a gesture of good faith... from you - a guest - to my country. How much do you have invested? You're the one who's supposed to know everything. 200,000. What if that plot you invested in was to be reannexed by the government? And how's the mining official's new car running? I would have chosen the red one myself. What would you gangsters say? "It's only business." Help me out and in return you can have South Africa. It's a beautiful country. I'm sure itis. Andalll havetodois... “turn over a few offices, huh? Nothing more. It seemed like a fair deal. So, while England swang like a pendulum do, with bobbies on bicycles two by two, I had all the ANC offices turned over. But I couldn't just hand over the stuff like he wanted. I had to have some act of defiance. Show this Den Bergh geezer I wasn't no mug. So I dumped the stuff outside his house. You know, like in the movies. Typical gangster style. I would like to call on Mr Mottram. Your Honour, Mr Mottram cannot be called. He is suffering from a serious heart condition, and if he were to be called, the risk to his life would be very great indeed. Do you ever play these, General? My kid brother supplies these. I don't know why. It's only going to lead to trouble, innit? That information you got for me... was very useful. Yeah. And you want me to get some more, eh? This time it's a bit different, Charlie. What do you have in mind, General? Where is he, Charlie? Cos I'm going to kill him. Mr Waldeck. ..I would put that gun away. They can be very dangerous things. Where's Bradbury, Charlie? She's run off with him. Let me give you some advice, Richard. Don't ever point a gun at me. I'm going to kill him, Charlie. - I'm going to kill Bradbury. - That's nice. You go and kill him, cos I'm eating my fucking dinner here. Fuck off. - Some more bread, please, love. - Certainly, sir. It's a simple thing, Charlie. Simple thing, eh? - You are fucking joking, aren't you? - No joke. Why me? Can't you do this... little thing yourself, eh? So, the great Charlie Richardson is not all he's cracked up to be. Maybe I should talk to that er... other London family. You know I can fucking do it. You know I can. Yeah, but will you? It's fucking treason, for fuck's sake. Tapping Harold Wilson's fucking telephone line is fucking treason. - It's only a phone tap. - He's the fucking prime minister! He's a Russian spy. You'd be doing your country a favour. Oh, forget it. I'l ask the Krays. Fuck you! Fuck you and the Krays! You know what? They couldn't do it anyway. - What's in it for me? - Safeguard of your investments. You know, Charlie, you've got a couple of loose cannons over here. All right, Charlie? Fucking shit! You might need someone to keep an eye on them. It was then that I got a call to say that Eddie and Frank Fraser had been nicked. I had to go back to London to try and sort things out. But back in South Africa, things went from bad to worse. Johnny Bradbury, the fucking idiot, he goes out and pops Richard Waldeck. Which sent any of my business hopes right to the gallows. The prick got 20 years for his efforts. So, what's the news, Roy? All we know is that Eddie and Frank got in a fight at Mr Smith's and some cunt pulls a shooter. Shooter? It's those fucking fruit machines. Next thing, the OId Bill's all over the place and they've whipped Eddie away. Like it was all... all planned, Charlie. - How about the Old Bill? - They don't want to know. What do you mean, they don't want to fucking know? Eh? They always want to fucking know! Not this time. You know Eddie ain't been paying 'em, Charlie. Something else is up. All our feelers are running scared. - What about the jury? - Can't get near ‘em. - The Old Bill's got... - Get me someone on the fucking jury, Roy! It's not that easy. No-one's come near us for weeks. Excuse me. Who are we dealing with here? Is ita mug? No, it's not. It's fucking Eddie. Eddie Richardson. He's my brother. Now, you fucking sort this for Eddie. Both of you two. Charlie, let me tell you something. - I've got envelopes full of bungs at the yard. - Oh, OK. - I ain't seen no-one. - So, suddenly, boys, the coppers have got fucking stupid and don't want to pay for their new cars and their fucking wives' holidays any more? You've got fucking envelopes in the office? Lose 'em! And find me some cunt on the fucking jury! All right. So... they did. They found me a jury member on Eddie's trial. That's him, over there. How much are you going to give him? As much as it fucking takes, Roy. Hang on, son. - Charlie, the Old Bill. - What the fuck are they doing here? Don't even fucking tell me this. Hang on, Roy. OK, son. Let's get the fuck out of here. Fucking do it. I really don't think this is well advised. If you don't, I will. Is there a problem? My lord, something has come to light that might have a direct bearing on this case. And that is? I think Your Honour would prefer if I would approach the bench. If you have something that has a bearing on this case, I'm sure the whole court would like to hear it. It's to do with Your Worship personally. My clients believe that you presiding on this case is not in their best interests. My client maintains that you met him and Mr Richardson at a railway station some years ago. I have never met either man before. Well, there was an incident where you were accosted. You fucking turd! I ought to fucking fetch you one, you little shit! Your old man was a cunt! A fascist coward! Furthermore, Mr Fraser was involved in an incident with your father on Wandsworth Common, where your father sustained neck injuries, I believe. - Blimey! It's Lawton! - Who? Lawton. The Governor of Wandsworth nick. Lawton's son. The geezer I nearly hanged 20 years ago. He's the fucking judge! My client is worried that this situation could be damning to him and the other defendant. The defendants believe that they have encountered me before. They refer to an incident on a platform of a London railway station. I wish to inform you that I was involved in such an incident. But I cannot recollect if the incident involved the two defendants. It is my opinion that they are using this incident to try and disrupt the case. I therefore see no reason to stand down. That is my final decision. You fucking wanker! You fascist bastard! - Tell 'em, you fucking fascist! - Off! Take him apart. - This has nothing to do with the trial, Charlie. - It has everything to do with the trial. I'm being set up here. This Lawton's a fucking fascist. Everyone knows it. Ask Frank. Mr Fraser's opinion of the judge is not going to carry much weight. You've seen that. You listen to me. His parents, they went out as guests to Mussolini's fucking wedding. His old man sponsored German propaganda ships in the war. And this cunt stood as a Blackshirts MP for Hammersmith fucking North. All I've done is sent a few old dears on holiday with the proceeds of a bit of hooky gear. - [fail to see... - You fail to see what? Don't you get it? I'm being set up here. One says we were eating sandwiches, the other says we were eating scampi. They can't even get their stories straight, they're so fucking thick. And what's all this shit now about torture, eh? Where do they get this from? You fucking find out who's feeding the press this shit! They produced a black box, Charlie. You work for me. Do you still fucking work for me? Oh, good. Good. So you were there. So you heard what they said. They said it was "like the one Mr Richardson used.” Like the fucking one. It's like you saying, you know, "my client was stabbed." You know, "We don't have a knife. But here's a weapon like the one used.” Like the one used! Keep your fucking ears shut! Now, suddenly, I'm head of a torture gang. But it's just me. Me and my brother Eddie. It's not much of a fucking gang, is it? Charlie, what do you want me to do? I'm fucked, ain't I? You got too big for them, Charlie. Everybody who leaves this country has to pay you to park their car. Yeah, I know that. Every scrap yard south of the Thames is sewn up. Your clubs, pubs... You're more powerful than the police! And this business with Van Den Bergh, I mean... And you think that's it? They're having a clean-up, Charlie. - The twins will be next. - Oh, fuck off with that! OK. OK, I was a bit naughty. I slapped a few people around. But everyone... everyone I fucked with was in the business. You know that. I never, never missed, never hurt outsiders. What am I looking at? Four, five years. Maximum, eight. OK. I'l do eight... if I have to. Charles Richardson, from the evidence I have heard in this case, I am satisfied that over a period of years, you were the leader of a large, disciplined, well-led, well-organised gang. And that for the purposes of your material interests and. on occasions, for the purposes of your criminal desire, you terrorised those who crossed your path. You terrorised them in a way that was vicious, sadistic and a disgrace to society. When I remember the evidence of some of your brutality... ..I am ashamed to think that one lives in a society that contains men like you. The sentence of this court must be severe. And for the following reasons. The court must show that it repudiates your ideas and is revolted by them. You must be prevented from committing further crime. It must be clear to all those who set themselves up as gang leaders that they will be struck down. I have come to the conclusion that there is no known penal system that will cure you but time. The only thing that will cure you is the passing of the years. You must go to prison for 25 years. Let me tell you something about prison. You take a bad man, you put him in a building with other bad men, you know what you get? A building full of bad men. Tripped, didn't he? So I offered him a cup of tea. And they put me in with some bad ones. lan Brady, Moors Murderer. Done for murdering a bunch of little kids. [wish I'd done him myself now. Now that would be worth doing time for.

Don't be a prat, Charlie. You've only got a few years left to do, Charlie. And I did. I had it off over the wall. And went to Spain, where everything is perfect. Or so I thought. I'd just escaped from Her Majesty's nick and put myself into one of my own making. I don't think I've ever... ever felt more alone in my life. This was it. Paradise. Four... drab... walls. With not much else to do but look back, face facts... ..and tell myself the truth. Dirty bastards! You lying fuckers! You fucking shit! You lying shit! Lying fucking bastards!
