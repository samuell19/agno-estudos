(student speaking) (Friend) Pankyo is really boring.➡ I wonder if I can start practicing operations soon. (Friend) Because that's how you hold a knife and fork. (Light music club member) This is the light music club. (Light music club members) Please. Thank you. Koshiba-kun, don't you want to join a circle? (Friend) Ah~ That's right. Ah~ I'm sorry. It's a little bit today. ♬～ (Mike) (Kuribayashi) Hypotheses become true only after they are proven. What about Mr. Yukawa? I'll be your substitute today. (Shingo) So where's the teacher going? Can you leave it for later? You're in the middle of a lecture, right? (howling) (Mike) (Kuribayashi) Hmm, how far did you go? (Shingo) Excuse me. (Mike) (Kuribayashi) Yes. (Student laughter) (Student) Seriously? You're wrong there. (Kuribayashi) Yes? With that formula, in the infrared region ➡ It does not match the spectrum of blackbody radiation. According to Planck's law, the energy must be discontinuous. So minus 1 is required. (Mike) (Kuribayashi) Wow... I know.➡ I was thinking of trying to see if anyone would notice. Did you know? I knew it Shall I wake him up? (knock) ♬～ (Students) Fun is OK. (Students) Smoke is OK. Teacher please Alright let's get started (students murmuring) Hahaha…｡ Hahaha...! It's a failure. Really interesting. Under the current conditions, a sufficient downdraft is not being generated. This is an incomplete reproduction of a downburst. Furthermore, from 2009 to 2010➡ Suggested by the observation project VORTEX2 conducted in the United States➡ The horizontal vortex tube, which is thought to be the source of tornado rotation, is also lacking. Next, each parameter in the gust front ➡ Let's try pattern 5. (Students) Yes. (Chime) Welcome to Teito University. Sorry for the late greeting. However, I was surprised to learn that Koshiba was a medical student. You used to be an excellent scientist like your father➡ You said it was your goal. Ah... I'm sorry. The teacher taught me many things. I will not apologize If you're as talented as you are, even in the medical field➡ You should be able to do something useful for people. gentlemen. Has science really enriched people? The greatest driving force behind the development of science is war. Because they think it's the death of a person. Nuclear physics is a good example. Today's advanced nuclear power generation exists ➡ This is because nuclear weapons were developed during the war. That's exactly right. Science and technology always have that aspect. It's not just used for good things. If it falls into the hands of an evil person, it is ➡ Forbidden magic. Scientists should never forget that. Science creates the future➡ It should exist for the sake of enriching the world. I'm doing a tornado experiment right now. If you have time, you should check it out. Is that ok? I am researching the as yet unexplained mechanism of tornadoes. As well as disaster countermeasures➡ They are also verifying its application to efficient ventilation systems. (mobile phone) (ring tone) Hello sister? Today at the university with Professor Yukawa... (Mobile phone) (Police officer) Hello. I'm from Azabudai Police Station➡ Cu Chi…. (Woman) Eh? Matches? (Male) It fits...｡➡ (Woman) It might be surprisingly interesting. (Male) Right? (cell phone) Who? (Male) It's a friend. It must be the woman from last time. (Male) No! Then can you show me? Yes. (Male) What are you doubting? Remember what I said last time? (explosive sound) Hey, don't play around with me... (Woman) Don't deceive me. Who are you seriously? (Male) Wow! (Woman) Eh? ♬～ Yes. (Nagaoka) Oh, I'm sorry. (Nagaoka) My name is Nagaoka, a freelance writer. Is Professor Yukawa here? here you are. Teacher, I can see you. (police car siren) Thank you for your hard work. We are on the second floor of the site. I'm tired. What about greetings? Hey you. These days, it's already... (Together) Thank you for your hard work! (Ohtagawa) Ah, Mr. Kusanagi. (Kusanagi) What is the identity of the victim? Osamu Nagaoka Age 38. Freelance writer by profession. Hit the back of the head? What's the murder weapon? (Igarashi) I think he beat me with an ashtray and took it away. (Yaginuma) Also, my wallet, mobile phone, and other valuable items are gone. It's definitely the work of a thief. Perhaps when the victim came home, he ran into the criminal who was looking for him... There is evidence that fingerprints have been wiped off. A robber would probably have gloves. No, even robbers who don't use gloves... After that, the victim took off his jacket and socks. It's hard to imagine that we ran into each other on our way home. But there are cases where people break in when there are people... In that case, would you like to prepare a weapon in advance? In other words, this is an impulsive crime by an acquaintance disguised as a robbery. (Kusanagi) I see. Makimura (Ohtagawa) That's right. Detectives search for various possibilities... It's certainly unlikely, but it's not zero. I'm sorry, Mr. Kusanagi. It's Makimura, not you, Otagawa-senpai. Hey! Somebody bring me a computer The date is September 8. This is a video from about two weeks ago. What this…. (Ohtagawa) Mr. Osamu Nagaoka, the victim➡ Recently, mainly about the Super Technopolis Project➡ (Kusanagi) Super technopolis? (Ota River) Commonly known as the ST Plan, in Mitsuhara City, Ibaraki Prefecture➡ He plans to create a base for a research institute that handles Japan's cutting-edge science and technology➡ It is a public project of the country. This plan will save Japan's future. (Ohtagawa) Former Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the originator➡ Ohga: Representative Hitsaku seems to be leading the way. Victims from Gwangwon City ➡ It seems that he was a central figure in the opposition to this plan. Information that could hinder the plan ➡ I may have been trying to grab it. Well then, hit Nagaoka's friendship on that line. (Tomoka/Otagawa) Yes. (Kusanagi) What happened to that video? I was able to identify the warehouse where the picture was taken➡ The phenomenon could not be clarified.➡ Just one interesting piece of information. A month ago, a similar phenomenon occurred nearby.➡ A motorcycle suddenly burst into flames on the riverbed of the Tama River➡ An incident is happening.➡ For motorcycle owners to go fishing at night with their partners➡ He testified that he had entered a restricted area. Kusanagi-san, where are you going? Ah, just a little bit. Teito University, right? I heard rumors about Mr. Yukawa. I also wanted to meet you once. You have other things to do, don't you? He is also a super weirdo. I am only interested in mysterious phenomena. Who is the culprit and what is the motive?➡ He has no interest in investigations or humans.➡ If you do anything, just let it go. It's easy to draw graffiti on the walls and annoy the people around you... I became more and more interested. When a type like you who is stubborn goes ➡ It just complicates things. Go back to work. (sound of car door opening) I'm curious about the video too. Ha...｡ here. Criminal out. It's been a while. My assistant, Mr. Kuribayashi. Nice to meet you, I'm Tomoka Makimura from the Kaizuka North Precinct. (Kuribayashi) It's fine. I'm in trouble. I have to come whenever something happens. What? Are you ready to move house? I'm sorry, but I'm busy preparing for the experiment. Well, don't say that... Hey, Makimura. something? Ah, my name is Makimura. Professor Yukawa, I won't let you take your time. It should take about 10 minutes. "A minute feels like an hour when you put your hand on a hot stove." "But when you sit with a pretty woman, an hour feels like a minute." In other words, time is relative ➡ The 10 minutes you say and the 10 minutes I say are not necessarily the same. Einstein, right? I mean ➡ Is it okay to call you a beautiful woman? Bring me another weird one... Yukawa I found a strange video. I want to hear your opinion. Makimura... A little! The police are the police and he has to do it. Suddenly, a hole opened in the wall of the warehouse. (Kuribayashi) A hole in the wall!? ♬～ (Kuribayashi) Professor Yukawa, this is... Mr. Kuribayashi, please put the things over there in the box first. eh? Please put that file in the box first. Ha... yes Makimura: Keep going. Yes. There are bullet holes at the scene➡ No trace of the use of firearms was found. Could this be a laser beam? laser? You see, there was an incident a while ago where a person's head suddenly burst into flames. A laser can't cut a hole in a wall like this. Then do you know what kind of phenomenon this is? Where did you get this video? What incident are you involved in? It's unusual for you to show interest in a police investigation. I'm not interested in the case. I just want information about this video. The other day, a person named Osamu Nagaoka ➡ Murdered... (Kusanagi) Hey, you have a duty of confidentiality, right? (Kusanagi) Actually, even a month ago➡ I'm having a similar phenomenon. Motorcycle suddenly catches fire The gas tank had a hole with a diameter of 3 cm. No bullets were found at the scene. A hole suddenly opens even though the firearm is not even used. Such a phenomenon is... Impossible, isn't it? Show me the scene where the video was filmed. (Sound of door opening) Mr. Kusanagi? king. ♬～ You're an interesting person, aren't you? Where are you weirdo? I am cooperating with the investigation. I don't usually feel like that. ♬～ The next scene This warehouse has not been used for a year ➡ It seems to have been abandoned. I think he was aiming at a target drawn with chalk. But look around here. There was no trace of a firearm. It's not impossible to shoot from the opposite bank 1km ahead➡ The firearms handled have also become large ➡ I think it would be easier to have evidence. That's certainly true. It's the same environment as the bike site earlier, isn't it? How do you think I'm going to open a hole? Let me verify it once. I'll send it No problem, but I'll send it to you. It's far to the station. No need. What!? How are you going home? (Mobile phone) (Announcement) Is the phone you dialed in a place where radio waves do not reach?➡ It doesn't work because the power isn't on. ♬～ ♬～ (Katsuta) It was also harvested at the planned construction site. After all, the scent is different when it's freshly harvested. Gwangwon City is rich in natural ingredients such as golden eagles and tufted dragonflies➡ Rare creatures also live here.➡ ➡ by large-scale development A lot of nature is lost. Then, why did Mr. Nagaoka cooperate with the opposition movement➡ It was to protect the environment, wasn't it? (Katsuta) That's not all.➡ Handling radioactive materials under the command of Nisaku Ohga➡ The construction of the research facility has begun forcibly. (Katsuta) Rumors have already spread ➡ Our house has just been renovated, but it's in this condition.➡ Cooperating with the opposition movement will not make you money. Even so, Nagaoka-kun desperately tries to protect this town... What kind of coverage did Mr. Nagaoka actually do? Recently, it seems that he has been investigating Oga. Have you heard anything? For example, you can force the plan to be canceled ➡ Did you get the information? (Yonemura) Especially. (Katsuta) If something happens, I think they will definitely contact us. So what has changed for you, Mr. Nagaoka, recently? Right now, there are no protests or fading, and there are no problems. Ah Speaking of which➡ I missed a protest meeting last week. (Katsuta) Ah. Well, it's not uncommon. Do you know who the interviewee is? (Yonemura) Certainly➡ It was Yukawa from Teito University. What about Yukawa and Nagaoka? (Cell phone) Yes. We met three days before the September 20 incident. (cell phone) I wonder why Dr. Yukawa kept silent about us. I'm going to go to Teito University. Please continue your inquiry in Gwangwon City. (cellphone) But... I'll take care of Yukawa here. (tapping sound) Huh...｡ (Ohtagawa) I'll have the mushroom ramen. Senior I'm going wait wait wait wait Wait wait wait wait wait Are you going to hit Oga? It's Makimura, not you. I'm sorry. No, you're a tough politician, aren't you? Stop it? Huh? Mr. Nagaoka ➡ I was looking into Deputy Oga. You might know something (Ohtagawa) You're nemawashi and procedures. Ah, one time to eat mushrooms? Huh? Let's keep calm. Huh? Naatite! Hey Igarashi. (Igarashi) Yes. Osamu Nagaoka and Manabu Yukawa, Associate Professor at Teito University➡ See if there is any connection. Confirmed. Geez…. ♬～ (Kuribayashi) That Professor Yukawa. What? Why did you keep the detectives silent about Mr. Nagaoka➡ There's something deep going on... I wasn't asked that question. So why didn't you tell me the truth? It's the truth? Look. When I saw that video➡ I don't know what the phenomenon is. I'm not saying I don't know. I just didn't say too much. Oh really. I'll go out for a while Take care. (Sound of door opening and closing) ♬～ Ah, I'm sorry to bother you. (Ukai) No, no, no. When I asked Mr. Ohga about this man➡ He doesn't seem to know. (Ohtagawa) Oh, I see. (Ukai) I have no idea about the incident. That's right. Now with this. If possible, I'd like to meet you in person and talk to you. Ah... for what? There must be something that only you know. I have been working as a secretary for Professor Ohga since my parents' generation. You think Ukai-san knows everything about Oga-sensei? Of course. I don't care... Ugh! Ugh... (Ohtagawa) Look, let's go, Makimura... Do you have any proof? Don't doubt people without proof. Even elementary school students can understand the reason. The Japanese police are... (Ohtagawa) Ah... I'm really sorry. let's go. (Mike) (Ohga) Eh, if we're going to revive the scientific nation as it is now ➡ It's just another dream First, we have to create an environment. If something happens to you, I will be held responsible. Because you don't know about Mr. Nagaoka➡ It's clearly a lie, isn't it? Then... (Ohtagawa) Are you sure? "I don't know" that Ukai says means to go home quickly. It's okay, remember that assumption. Ha...｡ With this plan, Gwangwon City and Japan ➡ You will definitely become rich. I am convinced of that. (applause) I will be in trouble if you do something selfish. Please do not let this happen in the future. (speaking voice) Thank you for your hard work. It was a great success. How was that person over there? (Ukai) When you say "over there"? It's the detective who came here. Ah, there is no problem at all. Professor, please concentrate on your government affairs. (Clerk) Shingo Koshiba, a first-year medical student. yes. (Clerk) I'm already out of school. drop out? When was that? (Clerk) Right after I enrolled in May this year.➡ At that point, the job had already been decided. (Machine operating sound) (Machine operating sound) (Yurina) Do you need anything? Excuse me. How is Shingo Koshiba today? Are you a police officer? No, my name is Yukawa from Teito University. Mr. Furushiba has left here. Is that so. Excuse me, but who are you? This is Yurina Kurasaka. This is my father's factory. Do you know what Koshiba-kun is doing after leaving the company? I don't know. I wasn't that close. Are you ready? Thank you very much she If Koshiba-kun contacted me➡ Please tell him that Yukawa from Teito University wanted to meet you. I understand. And one more thing. If the police come here, please don't mention me. (Student) I haven't seen Koshiba-senpai recently. Do you have any idea where he might go? If you're a professor at Teito University, can't you meet at the university? (Student) Huh? don't you know Seniors quit college Eh... why did you do that? I came here once in May. Could it be that Mr. Furushiba didn't bring back the experimental equipment? Yes. It's heavy, so please help me. But something changed and I was a little scared. was scary? Sister passed away I had to quit university and get a job. Makimura. Yes. can i have a minute? Hmm... what is it? You went for an interview without making an appointment. eh? It's Ohga Hitsaku. No, it just happened. (Kusanagi) It was stopped from above. I'm sorry. I should have told you not to decide. Well then, Professor Yukawa, please let me do it. No. I need to explore him carefully. We apologize for the inconvenience. But me too... this. This is Nagaoka's stolen mobile phone call history. Please investigate from one end to the other. yes. (Yurina) Are you Shingo? ♬～ 《Cosine 2X is 2 cosine squared X minus 1》 《Final exam? 》 《Yes. Can you solve it?》》 "lend me" (Yurina) 《Even though you took the trouble to teach me》 《Grief makes a person grow》 《Next time will be absolutely fine》 (Operating sound) 《Teacher, please grade it》 《Hmm》 《Okay…》 《All questions correct》 "Lie? Really? " "yes" (Yurina) 《Eh! seriously!?" 《I did it!》》 (sobbing) Yurina, come here for a second. yes. (Kurasaka) Excuse me.➡ It's my daughter Do you know this person's name is Osamu Nagaoka? I do not know. At 2:28 pm on September 12, this Nagaoka-san ➡ I am calling this company. Who responded? Maybe it's me. What was it about? I think it was a call to confirm the whereabouts of an employee. Who is that employee? I am Shingo Koshiba. What did you talk about at (Otagawa)? (Clerk) No, the call was cut off right away. Age is 19. Lost his mother at the age of 5➡ His father passed away in an accident four years ago. In April of this year, my sister passed away due to illness. After that, I quit university and got a job at Kurasaka Koki in May. However, he suddenly left the company on September 25th. September 25th? Two days after Nagaoka-san was killed. What is your connection with Nagaoka? The day before the incident➡ With someone who looks like Mr. Nagaoka near Kurasaka Koki➡ I have seen them arguing. And look at this I was a student at Teito University. Huh No, it's not a coincidence. Huh? After all, it seems that I have to hear from him once. (Kusanagi) An important witness surfaced. (Kusanagi) A young man named Shingo Koshiba.➡ The day before the incident, he was arguing with Mr. Nagaoka➡ It's been sighted And now I don't know where he is. Even if you ask me that, I have no way of commenting. He was a student at Teito University, but dropped out after just one month. don't you know why? here we go. He graduated from Towa High School. In other words, he's your junior, Yukawa. How many juniors do you think there are in this university? It's strange to know every single thing. September 20th Where were you and what were you doing? I don't understand the purpose of your question. Didn't you meet Osamu Nagaoka? am i under suspicion? It's not like that. I will cooperate with the investigation. You are not obligated to answer all questions. I'm sorry, but I'm sorry (Sound of door opening and closing) (Kusanagi) Mr. Kuribayashi. (Kuribayashi) I don't know anything. yes. Excuse me. (Kuribayashi) Hey... Mr. Kusanagi. ♬～ It's definitely Osamu Nagaoka. September 20th. Did he meet Nagaoka after all? Does that mean Mr. Yukawa is the culprit? Probably not why. Is it because he's Kusanagi-san's friend? If he is the culprit ➡ You shouldn't leave any traces of suspicion about yourself. Didn't you say before that "judgement is not good"? Anyway, it's true that you're lying. Talk to Dr. Yukawa. (Kusanagi) Well, wait. First, what is he trying to protect➡ It's because I stopped it. Shingo Koshiba Wash thoroughly. (sound of door opening) Huh... ♬～ 00:36:40,868 Hahaha... Are you staying up all night? What are you doing! I'm seriously going to sue you!? You're too rooted. I was a little worried and did some research. what kind? Ha...｡ Koshiba's older sister Akiho's cause of death➡ A body was found in a hotel room. At that time, he was being treated for illness, but... "Blood loss due to ruptured fallopian tubes" pregnancy? The opponent is unknown. I certainly don't mind. Moreover, Akiho is a reporter in the political department➡ I was covering the Super Technopolis project. eh!? So let's go to the hotel. eh? Ah, wait a minute, mushrooms... wait a minute. Wait a minute... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. (Bellboy) Yes, the body is on the bed.➡ Two glasses when the body was found➡ It was prepared on the table, but there was no evidence of its use. (Ohtagawa) I was meeting someone ➡ The other party is not convenient and can't come. A man collapsing on the day he can't come by chance ➡ Too coincidental, don't you think? What can I say? If you were with me, I'd definitely call an ambulance. Is it possible that you were there but you didn't call me? why? In order to hide his true identity, he let Akiho-san die ➡ I ran away. You're thinking too much. There was a staff member who said she saw a man with Akiho ➡ I should be there, but it's me. I've seen you talking in the lobby. Isn't it this person? Oh I think so "Impossible" "Interesting" "Who are you?" "For revenge." "Really interesting" "Hahaha... I don't understand at all" "As expected" (Teacher) When Koshiba entered the third grade➡ He became the only member of the Physics Research Club. So Koshiba sensed the danger of the club being abolished➡ It was Mr. Yukawa, an alumnus, who asked for help. Ah…. Ah, yes, yes. (Teacher) At the welcome party for new students under the guidance of Mr. Yukawa➡ It sounds like you did a very interesting experiment. Well, thanks to that, the department still exists. Umm, do you know Yukawa-sensei? Ah, Yukawa-kun is also a student of mine. Ah, I see. (Teacher) Yes.➡ You two look a lot alike. I saw Yukawa looking so happy ➡ It was my first time. ♬～ 《Ah, even our students can’t make it that well》 《Thank you very much. 《Frustration makes a person grow. Just try again.》 "yes" "I'm looking forward to your future" 《If you have a dream, please let me know》 (Akiho) 《You are so shy》 《My late father was also a scientist》 "Is that so? Why didn't you tell me?" 》 《Shingo is aiming to be a father, isn’t she?》 《Sister》 《Properly like a father➡ Be a good scientist "Those who control science control the world." "That's what my father used to say" (Akiho) 《“The Olympics are a good example!”》 《“Whether it’s training or tools ➡ Victory can only be given to those who master sports science! ”》 《If you can get to the bottom of even the theory of guts and the psyche, it’s brain science!》 《When it comes to evening drinks, it always feels like that》 "He didn't talk much about his work." 《There are various reasons for the development of science, but the biggest driving force is ➡ Inquisitive spirit to enrich the world ➡ I think it's hope "Those who control science control the world." "Good words" "yes" (Teacher) Yukawa-kun is a really pure student. Well, that's why I was worried. ＜(sound of door opening) I passed nearby ➡ I want to drink the coffee you put in. What are the advantages of instant coffee? It's a place where anyone can get the same flavor. But it's still a dirty cup. It's just old. It's clean, so don't worry. (cough barrier) Huh I went to Towa High School. Yukawa: Can you tell me the truth soon? What are you hiding? I wanted to avoid this kind of development, but ➡ Apparently that is no longer the case. To answer your question now ➡ It's all about Koshiba-kun. you…. Since when did you realize that Koshiba-kun was involved? From the beginning. On September 20, Mr. Nagaoka appeared here. That video is the goal. (Nagaoka) 《Do you know what kind of phenomenon this is? 》 “Can you put it away before answering the question? 》 "I don't remember making a promise to do an interview." (speaker) (operation sound) (Nagaoka) 《Excuse me, as usual》 "As expected, I can't say anything with this much information." (Nagaoka) 《I know the name of the person who created this phenomenon》 《This is Shingo Koshiba》 Koshiba-kun was under my guidance before. I was using the experimental equipment I learned at that time. I was shown a picture in high school. What is it? that. It's a railgun. 《With a launcher using the Lorentz force➡ The principle is very simple. (Nagaoka) 《Ah… Excuse me》 (Nagaoka) 《Can I borrow your pen? 》 《Ah yes》 《Please》 《Excuse me》 If you sandwich a conductive material and apply a large current instantaneously ➡ Joule heat converts conductive substances into plasma.》 《The projectile is pushed out by the plasma at a speed of several kilometers per second➡ will be fired》 It is quite possible to hit a target one kilometer away. you're kidding. Are you sure that this is the railgun that Furushiba-kun used? I found traces of a projectile in the warehouse. Projectile? Regarding the projectile in the railgun ➡ A non-conductive material is usually used. That's why there were no bullet-like pieces of metal left at the scene. What else did you talk about with Nagaoka? I got one last question. 《Is it possible to kill a person with this tool?》》 《The total weight of a railgun that requires this much power is ➡ It weighs about 100kg. Zero mobility.》 《It is impossible to shoot a moving human》 《What about a person who is standing still?》》 《Then you should use a knife or something》 《A railgun is not a weapon in the first place》 《This is an experimental device》 Why didn't you tell me about it first? Koshiba has nothing to do with the murder. I was just doing an experiment. An experiment? Created in high school using a Kurasaka machine ➡ I was improving the accuracy and power of the railgun. A warehouse and a motorcycle would be one of those experiments. I don't think it's just an experiment. April this year at a hotel in Tokyo➡ The body of Shingo Koshiba's older sister Akiho was found. That's it... In fact, it's possible that the person you were waiting for left you dead. That person might be Nagaoka. (Kusanagi) Mr. Akiho supported his livelihood by himself after his father passed away➡ I managed to get my younger brother, Shingo, to go to college. For Nagaoka who let his sister die ➡ No wonder you feel so angry. It's just your speculation. Ha...｡ Then why did Shingo Koshiba disappear immediately after the incident? Why were you arguing with Nagaoka the day before the incident? Treating him as a murderer on that basis ➡ It's illogical. It's out of the question. The railgun isn't a murder weapon. I thought I said it was an experimental device. But it can also be used as a weapon. It is absolutely impossible to use it as a tool for murder! impossible? It's illogical to treat him as a good person just because he's a junior you know well. A case in which a person who was sincere turns to murder ➡ I've seen this with my own eyes many times. Hey Yukawa. People change After drinking coffee ➡ Please put the mug back in the sink. No need to wash. ♬～ (Employee) Welcome back. (Yurina) Thank you for your hard work. (mobile phone) (vibrator sound) hello? Are you Shingo? A policeman came the day before yesterday, and Dr. Yukawa also came. (cell phone) (Shingo) Did you say something? Hey Shingo, did you kill someone named Nagaoka? So are you running away? (Mobile phone) (Yurina) The police are looking for Shingo. I'm sorry for worrying you. This is the last time, so listen carefully. Hey what's the last one? What are you apologizing for? (Mobile phone) Hey, Shingo-kun, I'm begging you, give it up. I am…. ♬～ something? I'm sorry. Because of me, Detective Kusanagi... No, I'm the one for Kuribayashi-san➡ I should have told you the truth sooner. Ah, actually ➡ I have something to worry about about Mr. Nagaoka.➡ Do you remember? That I lent Nagaoka-san a pen. (Nagaoka) 《Can I borrow your pen? 》 《Ah yes》 《Please》 《Excuse me》 (Kuribayashi) But before that. (Nagaoka) 《Excuse me, as usual》 (Kuribayashi) I glanced at another pen in my inner pocket. Kuribayashi: I wonder why he didn't use that pen. Hmm... I'm sorry, but it doesn't matter. Excuse me. What's the matter all of a sudden? I have a hypothesis. I want to prove that hypothesis. Here it is. When Mr. Nagaoka was killed, was there a ballpoint pen in the inside pocket of his suit? I don't think so. What is it? When Mr. Nagaoka visited the lab, Mr. Kuribayashi borrowed a ballpoint pen. But I have another one in my suit pocket➡ I think it had a silver pen in it. So why didn't you use it? Probably not because I didn't use it➡ Couldn't use it Is this it? Mr. Kusanagi! Hey, where have you been on your own? I found the culprit. Huh? Isn't it old grass? I found this in Mr. Nagaoka's room. It's a voice recorder. The date is September 23, 21:34. It matches Mr. Nagaoka's estimated time of death. (Computer) (Nagaoka) Carefully? why? (Computer) (Man) Why... (Computer) (Nagaoka) There is no reason why articles should appear... (Computer) (Dull sound) (Computer) (Nagaoka) Ah! (Computer) (Man) Ha... ha... forgive me... forgive me.... This voice...Yes, that's right. do you know? What happened between you and Osamu Nagaoka? I was called to Nagaoka that day. 《I got a story that can crush Ohga》➡ 《Evidence is also here》 (Katsuta) 《Oh…》 《With this, we can cancel the Super Technopolis Project.》 (Katsuta) 《Ah…》 (Katsuta) Nagaoka wants to write an article on that story quickly. Nagaoka-san was Katsuta-san's ally, right? Why? (Katsuta) The devil got me. Due to reputational damage, the store's management is in decline, resulting in a large amount of debt. (Katsuta) So I got the information about the opposition ➡ I went to cormorant fishing. Is that why the opposition movement has died down? But while the debt piles up... I needed more money. (Nagaoka) 《What would you do if you consulted with everyone and information leaked again》 "But you should be careful when publishing articles." (Nagaoka) 《Be careful? why? 》 《Why…》 《There is no reason why articles should not appear…》 (beating sound) (Nagaoka) 《Ah! 》 《Please forgive me… Please forgive me…》 (Katsuta) It occurred to me that this information would be profitable. What's the evidence now? I gave it to Ukai. So what kind of information did Mr. Nagaoka have? Mr. Nagaoka was pursuing an affair with Representative Ohga. Adultery!? The adultery partner ➡ Koshiba: It was Mr. Akiho. In other words, the one who let Akiho-san die was ➡ Representative Oga. 《Look at this J is Ohga》 《Ah…》 Mr. Nagaoka has an e-mail exchange that proves it. It seems that he had obtained Knowing that much, why didn't you catch Ohga? Katsuta's testimony alone cannot prove the crime. There is no evidence anywhere. Well, the real culprit was found anyway. You mean this matter is resolved? I'm sorry I doubted you, Koshiba. I was helped by Mr. Yukawa. And Kuribayashi's power of observation? Thanks to Heh, that's why I won't be able to rely on you next time... Nothing is over yet. Koshiba Shingo's suspicions have been cleared, right? Koshiba-kun, why did you start making railguns? Why were you arguing with Nagaoka-san? And why are you still missing? Yukawa-sensei, what are you trying to say? Ohga isn't the sort of opponent that ordinary people can get close to. That's why I needed to make a railgun that could shoot from afar. Shingo Koshiba's aim is Hitsaku Ohga. (Kuribayashi) No way! surely. Mr. Nagaoka came here to show the example video➡ It was to see if the murder was feasible. 《Is it possible to kill a person with this tool?》》 Mr. Nagaoka realized that Shingo Koshiba was serious ➡ I tried to persuade him but failed. I was about to publish the article in a hurry ➡ If you think that it was to prevent a crime, it makes sense. Then Koshiba-kun is hiding his whereabouts... That's because he hasn't given up on revenge yet. (Kusanagi) Wait, Yukawa. Are you going to move alone again? There is one missing part in the previous reasoning. How was Nagaoka able to notice the revenge plan? Evidence of adultery and a video of the warehouse that Mr. Nagaoka obtained ➡ It's hard to believe that Koshiba-kun handed it over. (Kuribayashi) Now that you mention it, how? There is another person who knows the revenge plan. how do you think she knows When I visited her, she said, "Are you the police?" She is Koshiba-kun's crime ➡ I knew you were trying to get your hands dirty. I see. I have something I want to ask you about Shingo Koshiba. I don't know anything It wasn't Koshiba-kun who killed Nagaoka-san. Don't worry. The real culprit has been caught. Koshiba is planning to take revenge on his sister. That's true? We don't want him to make mistakes. I got a call yesterday. (Mobile phone) (Shingo) "This is the last time, so listen carefully." 《Hey, what is the end? What are you apologizing for? 》 "I am…" 《Kill Oga at the groundbreaking ceremony》 Local festival... (Yurina) Please stop Shingo-kun! Shingo isn't the kind of person to do that! ➡ please! I understand, so calm down. (Yurina) Please! ➡ please! please! It's okay. It's okay. (Yurina) Please! Yeah yeah (Yurina) Please! are you OK. The first time I saw that... ♬～ (Impact sound) (Yurina's scream) 《Shingo-kun, what is this? 》 (Shingo) "Don't tell anyone what you just saw" "What are you doing? why can't i talk 》 "Those who control science control the world." 《Nisaku Ohga often says this on TV, right?》➡ "That's the word Ohga stole from my sister." (Yurina) And then Shingo-kun ➡ That your sister was left to die by Ohga Hitsaku➡ He told me he was planning revenge. It wasn't long after that that I met Mr. Nagaoka.➡ If you write an article about Ohga ➡ You might be able to stop Shingo.➡ With that in mind, I took the data out of Shingo's computer. (Nagaoka) 《Why is this J called Ohga? 》 《It seems that Shingo made a phone call to find out J’s true identity.》 《This is the exchange at that time》 (PC) (Shingo) "Hello" (Mobile phone) (Ohga) < 01:01:54,848 《This is the Azabudai police station.》 (mobile phone) 《Azabudai police? What do you want me to do? 》 《Certainly Ohga’s voice》 《And this》 (Nagaoka) 《What is this…》 《I don't know》 《But in high school➡ He said he received guidance from a person named Yukawa-sensei.』 Shortly after that, Mr. Nagaoka was killed and Mr. Shingo disappeared.➡ I don't understand anymore... Koshiba was an excellent student of mine. Longing for his father who is a scientist➡ Why did Koshiba, who was studying science purely, give up on the path of science?➡ And now have you chosen science as the tool of murder? "I was betrayed by my father" Shingo said so. I'm sure if things continue like this, Shingo will... I want you to believe in Koshiba-kun. Until now, many humans have used science for the wrong purposes➡ I've been using But overcome your mistakes on your own➡ Humans have a strong power to return to the right path. That's why I want to believe in you too. ♬～ (Akiho) "Hey! Congratulations on your entrance! 》 (Shingo) 《Yo》 [Cool] [Really? 》 (Shingo) 《Yes. Thank you.》 ♬～ (Shingo) < 01:04:41,815 "Those who control science control the world." (applause) (Shingo) "Those who control science control the world." "Those are my father's words." 《My sister was serious》 "Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to talk about my father." (Shingo) 《My sister was left to die...》 (explosive sound) (Shingo) 《There is no option to do nothing》 ♬～ (Kusanagi) Well, I'm inquiring about the groundbreaking ceremony from above. yes. You're a good person, aren't you? This is Mr. Yukawa. Not only does it make you go crazy ➡ There is a great sense of trust and consideration for the students. Yukawa is not the kind of person who is influenced by emotions. If there's something that drives him, it's ➡ A sense of responsibility. A sense of responsibility? Should I call it a sense of mission? ＜(Knock) ＜(Sound of door opening) (Employee) Sorry to keep you waiting. It's about Keisuke Koshiba. ♬～ "The one who killed you..." "Don't talk anymore." "Is there a sin of silence?" [Crying for that deep love] Participate in the groundbreaking ceremony!? It seems that tomorrow's groundbreaking ceremony is a very important event. That's why my life is at stake. My superior said so and refused. (Kusanagi) Otagawa. (Otagawa) Yes. Go to Ohga's office and see the detailed schedule for tomorrow➡ Please bring it to me. (Ohtagawa) Yes. (Kusanagi) How about Igarashi? (Igarashi) For our security system ➡ I'm going to ask the Ibaraki Prefectural Police for their cooperation... Why are you following me~! You absolutely don't do unnecessary things! (Elevator button pressing sound) I know. Please keep the guards as inconspicuous as possible. In the first place, if the culprit is identified ➡ I want the man to be arrested immediately. I am trying hard. (Ukai) There is no reason for the teacher to aim for my life, but ➡ If a dangerous person is left unchecked ➡ I'm in trouble. (Ohtagawa) I'll try to solve it as soon as possible. Now then. Don't be fooled! Ohga-sensei's life is being targeted by an affair partner➡ Koshiba: It's because you let Akiho-san die!? If you think about what to say. Mr. Katsuta, whom you acquired ➡ I'm confessing everything. What a sloppy thing... (Ohtagawa) Makimura! let's go. (Ukai) I should have said that everything is evidence. If there is no evidence, it is ➡ It's no different than our nasty cursing. Extremely unpleasant! You grabbed the evidence. Wh... What? Hahaha... let's go.➡ Hahaha Excuse me. Let's go.➡ Let's go. Excuse me. Huh! It's over My life as a police officer is really over. Eh... or rather, it's all your fault. excuse me. Hey~ What's wrong?➡ Ha~ (mobile phone) (Ukai) 《Have you been contacted by anyone? 》 (Ohga) 《No, now call an ambulance》 (mobile phone) 《No》➡ "Please leave the room immediately." (Ohga) 《But…》 (mobile phone) 《Pretend there was no one there》 (Ohga) Mr. Ukai, what was your decision at that time? Was it really right? Calling an ambulance didn't help her. The teacher chose the best path. Mr.➡ I can't go back anymore. (mobile phone) (vibrator sound) Hello. (cell phone) (Kusanagi) It's me.➡ In the end, I couldn't stop myself from participating in Ohga's groundbreaking ceremony. Where is Koshiba-kun going? (mobile phone) No, I don't know. (Mobile phone) Tomorrow, we will work with the local prefectural police to prepare a security system.➡ Actually, I'm going to be in the area from now on. Then... (mobile phone) "Let me go with you," right? < (Klaxon) I'll treat you to coffee when the case is safely resolved. Why is it instant coffee again? Didn't you come here because you wanted to drink that last time? Ah yes It was found in Shingo Koshiba's room during a house search. It's a projectile drawing. Yukawa. Find him and stop him. Please trust us and lend us your strength. Is your purpose to spy on me? What are you talking about? Mandarin orange skin eh? No, it's nothing ♬～ (Ohtagawa) Have you seen this man? I've never seen one before. (Ohtagawa) Then let's go. (Kusanagi) This is a good place to aim from a distance. good morning. Thank you very much, Mr. Yukawa. What is the seat of Representative Ohga? It will be in the center of the front row. Do you plan to attend another groundbreaking ceremony soon? Today is the only day I plan to participate in the groundbreaking ceremony. ♬～ (Ukai) After the ground-breaking ceremony, the teacher is scheduled to give a speech. (Ukai) This is the manuscript. Well, after the groundbreaking ceremony is over ➡ Greetings from the mayor and the planning director of the ST Planning Promotion Organization➡ Commemorative photo will be taken. Then move to Gwangwon Municipal Baseball Stadium.➡ Well there... (Akiho) 《The opposition movement seems to be gaining momentum》 (Akiho) 《The teacher will be turned into a villain again》 (Ohga) 《It is important to protect the beautiful nature》➡ 《However, that alone cannot feed humans.》 《In the end, this country has no choice but to sell science and technology》 "It's too late to regret it after decades" 《Somebody has to get mud on me now》 "Those who control science control the world." "Hmm? 》 《It is a spell to make everyone happy》 "Who controls science controls the world?" ♬～ (Ohga) 《What? that is" (Akiho) 《Since my younger brother has been selected for the medical school of Teito University➡ It's a celebration of the school admission.] (Ohga) 《The day may come when I can be of use to you as a teacher.》 (Ohga) 《I'm looking forward to it》 (Cormorant fishing) A get-together for ST project officials after the event➡ Back in Tokyo at night... (Ohga) Ukai-san. Let's not attend the groundbreaking ceremony after all. The police also have a security system in place. I am not afraid of being killed. I don't want Akiho's younger brother to become a criminal. If you still feel guilty ➡ Furthermore, you should attend the groundbreaking ceremony.➡ Realizing the ST plan she supported ➡ It should feed her. (typing sound) (Investigator) Arrival in Maltai. (radio) (electronic sound) (Kusanagi) Everyone is on alert... ♬～ What are you doing at a time like this? (Moderator) Then from now ➡ We will hold a groundbreaking ceremony for the new construction of ST Plan. A ritual of exorcism. (Kusanagi) There's no way to block bullets flying from 1km away. Make sure you find Shingo Koshiba before the railgun hits you. (Moderator) Ceremony of Koshin. Everyone, please stand up. It's about 20 minutes left. I hope nothing will happen. (typing sound) (Shinto priest) Promoting the Mitsuhara Super Technopolis Project... (Kusanagi) Hey, haven't you found it yet? (Transceiver) (Electronic sound) (Ohtagawa) I haven't found it yet. ♬～ did something happen? (Moderator) Mr. Nisaku Ohga, member of the House of Representatives. ♬～ (Kashiwa hand) (radio) (electronic sound) really? Understood. I'll be right there. A railgun device has been found. (Igarashi) Mr. Kusanagi, it's over here. (Investigator) Over here. how's it going? (Igarashi) Shingo Koshiba is ➡ He must have given up on the crime when he saw the police. gave up? Yukawa Sensei The groundbreaking ceremony should have already ended. The worst could have been avoided. Wrong. Huh? This railgun is a dummy. A dummy? This was made by Koshiba when he was in high school. A device of this size cannot make a hole in the warehouse. In other words, Koshiba has prepared another railgun. ♬～ Koshiba's aim is not the groundbreaking ceremony. Huh? What does it mean? If you try to aim the rail gun at a distance of around 1 km ➡ It takes at least an hour. If Oga's seat is not known in advance ➡ You can't aim. Besides, there are many people around Mr. Ohga. Furushiba even put unrelated people in danger ➡ I can't imagine taking revenge. But when he kills Representative Ohga at the groundbreaking ceremony, he himself. They used Yurina to mislead the police. To concentrate security elsewhere. Makimura Ohga, where are you now? To participate in the boys' baseball tournament ceremony➡ We are moving to Gwangwon Municipal Stadium. Do you have a map? (Investigator) Yes. It's here Deputy Oga from the baseball club appeared as a pitcher➡ We will hold a first pitch ceremony with a former professional baseball player from Gwangwon City. Starting ball... (Kusanagi) Hey! ♬～ What's the map? Koshiba's railgun is here. Shingo Koshiba's aim is definitely the first pitch. The pitcher must always stand on the plate of the mound. And only one person stands on the mound. No harm to other humans. It's the perfect place, isn't it? Please stop. Huh? What happened? I don't want to see Koshiba-kun arrested. I'll leave it to you later. (sound of car door opening) (Kusanagi) Hey! Kusanagi-san, let's go. (car running sound) (Boys shout) (Igarashi) Shingo Koshiba's aim ➡ Because the possibility of this opening ceremony came out ➡ Just in case, we will continue to be vigilant. (Ukai) Please do not stand out. (Igarashi and others) Yes. Still can't find the railgun? No matter how much I look for it, I can't find it. What's really going on here? Expand your search area. (Transceiver) Where is the area around (Otagawa) likely to aim for a baseball stadium ➡ I can't find it. that person! eh? Hold on. eh? (brake sound) Cah! What happened!? I'm going back. I was deceived by Yukawa. Huh!? The railgun is where Yukawa dropped off. He intends to settle the matter by himself. It's time (Ohga) Ukai-san. (Ukai) What is it? I will do my job well. Please take a good look. ♬～ (Mike) (Moderator) Then, let's make an appearance.➡ Please welcome everyone with a big round of applause.➡ With former professional baseball player Katsumi Hirosawa from Mitsuhara ➡ Former Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Representative Ohga Nisaku. (Applause/cheers) ♬～ (Male) Teacher, do your best~! ♬～ (Referee) Strike one! (Applause/cheers) (Computer) (Ring tone) (PC) Whether or not a railgun can be used to snipe a target 1km away.➡ It's a very interesting experiment.➡ Unless the target is a human head. Yukawa Sensei I had to rewrite the main program. You have control of the railgun here. I took a closer look at your railgun. It's wonderful. (PC) Projectile gave up a year and a half ago➡ Did you adopt the propeller proposal? Yukawa, where are you, Yukawa? Ah, this way. Spherical glass coated with resin ➡ Y-shaped cuts were made in the resin at 120 degree intervals.➡ The moment it is fired, the resin begins to peel off in three directions due to air resistance. (Yukawa/Shingo) Like a mandarin orange peel. The peeled resin acts as a propeller blade➡ Rotate the whole projectile. Mandarin orange peels can be torn off instantly ➡ Directivity is increased by the remaining rotational motion➡ Air resistance is also reduced. But still, according to my calculations, the probability of hitting the target is about 50%. It is correct. But I couldn't think of any other way. (Referee) Ball two! I understand the situation. You're not a saint, either. Mr. Yukawa! Yukawa! (Two people) Hahahaha…｡ Was good! You made it in time. What are you doing? There's something I want to tell Koshiba-kun. It's about your father Keisuke Koshiba. I think you already know Your father was in America 20 years ago➡ He was involved in the development of anti-personnel landmines. Landmines? I found out last summer. (Computer) When I learned that fact ➡ For those of you who purely wanted to be a scientist➡ He must have felt betrayed by both his father and science. But there is still more to Dad's life. continuation? (PC) After retiring from an American company, his father ➡ Transferred to Akatsuki Heavy Industries.➡ I went there yesterday and heard about your father. At the time the mines were being developed, the developers ➡ The real danger landmines pose to the future world➡ I didn't recognize it correctly. However, one day, due to a landmine left on the battlefield➡ I saw a child with both legs blown off. At that time, the father realized his big mistake➡ I was very ashamed of myself. (Computer) From that feeling of revenge, the father, at Akatsuki Heavy Industries Engaged in research on sensing technology➡ It is said that he was building a machine to detect and remove landmines. In the research notebook of my father who was sleeping in Akatsuki Heavy Industries ➡ I was left with this sentence: “Landmines are alongside nuclear weapons ➡ It's the worst thing ever made by a scientist." "Science is for saving people" (Computer) "No matter what happens, science and technology ➡ It is unacceptable to hurt or threaten a person's life." (PC) "He who controls science controls the world" ➡ When you think of nuclear weapons and land mines➡ This word has a completely different meaning. I'm sure your father used it as a warning to himself➡ I'll try not to forget those words. (Computer) And your sister about this word➡ "It's a spell to make everyone happy," he said in a newspaper article. She must have also understood the essence of science well. (Referee) Foul ball! What do you think, Mr. Furushiba? What are you trying to do now➡ Do you really want your father and sister in heaven➡ Will it please you? (Computer) I didn't teach you science because I wanted you to do this. (Computer) But I don't want to force you to give up. eh? ➡ If you want to achieve it, I will lend you my strength. Because I'm the one who made the railgun. So I'll settle teacher what do you mean? (Computer) Give me a signal from you. The moment Deputy Ohga's head enters the sight➡ I fire a projectile. (together with the audience) Ah~ Yukawa What are you saying? The count is 2 balls 2 strikes. If you're going to do it, the sooner the better. (Kusanagi) Hey, are you kidding me? In this situation➡ do you think i'm lying Don't come any closer than that. If you approach me or an investigator tries to contact Koshiba ➡ Fires a railgun. Yukawa: Are you sure? The most certain I've ever been in my life. You're going to kill someone!? I'm ready for that. This is a punishment for not teaching science correctly to students. As a leader, you have to take responsibility. Mr. Kusanagi... Stay away from the railgun. I'm leaving soon! (Computer) (Kusanagi) Yukawa I'm serious too. (Kusanagi) If you feel like it, I'll be a detective➡ I have to shoot you (Kusanagi) I'm begging you, Yukawa. Do as you like I'm sorry. Please don't worry about this. Besides, do you have a signal yet? Yukawa! What happened? (Computer) Are you going to give up? (Computer) Well, it looks like we'll be settled soon. Right now, Deputy Ohga's head is in sight. If you want to give a signal, now's your chance. Yukawa Sensei (sobbing) gentlemen…. (sobbing) (sound of hitting a ball) (Applause/cheers) Ah... Ah... Ah...｡ (sobbing) gentlemen…. me…. It's a hit in front of the center. Instead of Koshiba ➡ It looks like he beat Representative Oga. Ha...｡ (Mike) (Moderator) Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ohga and Mr. Hirosawa➡ Please give us a big round of applause. (applause) (Mike) (Moderator) Thank you very much. The Sparrows vs. Rainbows match begins. (Kusanagi) Huh… huh…｡ Ha... Ha...｡ ♬～ (TV) (Reporter) Earlier, the car carrying the suspected member of the House of Representatives, Nisaku Ohga, was found ➡ We arrived in front of the Wangan Chuo Police Station.➡ Suspect Ohga turned himself in to the police last night➡ He was arrested on suspicion of abandoning a guardian.➡ I have already submitted my resignation letter and my resignation as a member of the Diet. What!? New York!? (Kuribayashi) Huh? didn't you hear? I'm going to do research over there. I don't think I can come back for a while. Is that so. I'm sorry I wanted to say hello to you properly. So what about today? No way again? wrong. I have a report about Koshiba-kun. I was indicted for damaging property. (Kuribayashi) Huh!? However, it will not be a prison sentence because it will be suspended. The president of Kurasaka Koki offered to be my sponsor. I see. It looks like he's going to retake the entrance exam for the Faculty of Science and Engineering at Teito University next year. ♬～ Also, Yukawa-sensei has a message for Kusanagi-kun. “Kusanagi, I am grateful to you for this matter.” Huh. It doesn't look like him. And to you eh? What is it? (Kuribayashi) "Even if an inexplicable incident occurs➡ Please don't ever come to New York." What is that? (Kusanagi) Hahaha. It's a typical message from him. (Kuribayashi) And this.➡ When Kusanagi-kun comes, please let me out. Did he say something like "I guarantee the taste"? that? what about me? (Kuribayashi) Why to you? Mr. Yukawa said to Mr. Kusanagi. eh? Wouldn't it be nice if you let me in while you were at it? If you want to drink it yourself, please. Huh!? It certainly tastes the same no matter who puts it in. The language, the sense of distance, the TPO, too➡ The concept of hierarchy is all wrong. Isn't that why you're always an assistant? (Kuribayashi) Well... how can you say that so straight.➡ I wonder why the female detectives at Kaizuka North Precinct are always like this. noisy! (Kuribayashi) Enter mine too.
