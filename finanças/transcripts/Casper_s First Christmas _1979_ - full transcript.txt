With no decorations or anything. Especially one that's about to be torn down. Well, just in case. I'd better be prepared. Let's see. Hmm. "Dear Santa "if you should happen to come by this way "I have, but one wish.. [mumbling] Signed your friend, Casper." I certainly hope Santa comes. [clock chimes] Jeepers! I've got to get to bed. [snoring] [chiming continues] [chiming continues] Huh? 8 o'clock? [yawning] Hey, hey. Come on, kiddo. Time to rise and shine. We've got a lot of house hunting to do. Get a move on. What do you think this is, a holiday? [laughing] It is a holiday, Hairy. - It's Christmas eve. - 'Huh?' Can't we just this once spend Christmas Eve at home? And maybe do a little decorating. Christmasdecorating? Ghosts don't decorate. They scare people! But I don't want to scare people. I'm a friendly ghost. Ghosts don't believe in Christmas. I do. That is, I want to. They say that Christmas Eve is when friends gather and express love and happiness good wishes, friendship and-and you-know-who comes. Huh? Friends? Are you pulling my sheets, bub? Ghosts don't have any friends. You got to somethin' straight in that transparent little head of yours. Look out there, bub. If we had any friends.. 'Why, if there was anything to that Christmas talk' 'they wouldn't be tearing down our house' 'as soon as the snow clears.' 'Christmas! Friends!' Baloney! Uh, you said, "You-know-who" is coming. Who's "You-know-who" that's comin'? Why, Santa Claus, Hairy. Santa Claus. You know, the spirit of giving. A spirit? A spirit! Why didn't you say so, kiddo? You mean they're scarier than me? [growls] You see, huh? Huh? Huh? [laughing] Golly, no, Hairy. Santa Claus isn't a ghost. He's supposed to be a big jolly gentleman. With rosy cheeks and a big round belly that shakes when he laughs. Like a bowl full of jelly. Sounds like one of those types that run for political office. But, Hairy, all kids know about Santa Claus. (Casper) He travels from house to house on Christmas eve bringing gifts to everyone. Hold it, boy. I say hold it. You're a ghost, kid. Nobody gives a ghost anything. And ghosts don't have any friends. If a ghost wants something, he's gotta get it for himself. - But Hairy-- - That's enough, kid. You gotta get that Christmas and Sanity Claus baloney out of your head. We've got a crisis on our hand. (Hairy sobbing) They're gonna tear our home down. We've gotta concentrate on finding another house to haunt. (Boo Boo) 'Where are we, Yogi?' 'Shouldn't we be nearing the mountain lodge by now?' (Yogi) 'Now, don't worry, Boo Boo boy.' 'We should've already been there a long time ago.' (Snagglepuss) At the rate we're going.. ...we'll be lucky to get to the lodge bynext Christmas. If you ask me my super duper Ernie Western Indian guide instincts tell me that we should have turned right back down the road apiece. Somebody said, "Turn left" and said, "Left." Somebody else said, "Right." So...quite naturally I turned right. In this case, Yogi, right was wrong. Huh? Great! What a wrong turn of events this is. If we don't get to the lodge, we don't get to have Christmas. Golly, dear old dad, Christmas will come whether we find the lodge or not. That's my boy who said that. And he might have a point there. And I don't mean on the top of his head. That's right, Augie Doggie. Christmas will come, no matter where we're at. (Augie) All we need is a place to be cozy and warm. (Doggie Daddy) 'And a pretty Christmas-time tree with all the trimmings.' (Huckleberry) 'And Santa Claus will be sure to find us.' Look, Yogi, there's an old house, straight ahead. (Snagglepuss) 'Heavens to Murgatroyd.' 'It's an old house. Straight ahead.' (Yogi) 'Y-a-y! That place gives me the creeps.' I wonder if it leaks. (Augie) It may look creepy now but with a nice fire in the fireplace.. (Boo Boo) And a pretty Christmas tree. Why, we could have the place looking peachy keen. In no time. Well, then, what are we waiting for? (Quick Draw) Yippee, let's get this show on the road. Let's deck the halls. (Yogi) The last one inside is the last one inside. Okay, everybody. Let's just spread out and brighten this otherwise dingy place up. Y-a-y. ♪ We're making a big-to-do about this Christmas ♪ ♪ Everybody's trimming the Christmas tree ♪ ♪ With lights that glow and mistletoe ♪ ♪ Colored balls tied with a bow ♪ ♪ And cookie dolls and ginger dough for me ♪ And me. ♪ Hey, we're making a big-to-do about this Christmas ♪ Yuletide spirit is catching, yes siree! ♪ Upward strings Pencil beans ♪ ♪ Stars that shine The bell that rings ♪ ♪ Shrieks of joy and laughter ring to thee ♪ ♪ A snowman that is kinda fat ♪ That's really made of snow. ♪ Stalkings hung The biggest ones ♪ ♪ With no holes in the toe ♪ ♪ Hey, we're making a big-to-do about this Christmas ♪ ♪ Like in a ba-ba-ba-boo and doing it right ♪ ♪ Our tree is green The best I've seen ♪ ♪ We have swept the chimney clean ♪ ♪ So Santa Claus can make the scene tonight ♪ ♪ Santa Claus can make the scene tonight ♪ Great piggledy picolaus. We've covered the whole countryside and can't find another beat up old house to haunt. - Hairy, look. - Huh? What? What is it? Where? What? What? - Our house. - Our house? - 'A light in our window.' - 'That can't be.' - 'We don't own any light.' - A car! Someone's come to pay us a visit. Visit, my foot. They're claim jumpers, kid. You can't trust anybody these days, especially at night. Take it easy, bub. I'll handle this. Golly, gee. Hmm. (Casper) 'Wow! Boy!' 'Gee, a warm fire and a Christmas tree.' 'It's beautiful, it's--' It's disgusting. (Yogi) 'Y-a-y, how about that, Boo Boo boy?' These old tree ornaments must have been sitting around 'just gathering dust for years.' Yeah, Yogi, but they'll come in handy now for our Christmas party. A Christmas party! Maybe they'll invite us, Hairy. O-o-h! There's that word again, "Christmas." I tell you, there's nothing to that Christmas stuff. And there ain't no Sanity Claus either. I'll teach them to come into my place and mess it up. But Hairy.. Gee, I'd like to be their friend. I think somebody should look for some more firewood. Maybe there's some down in the basement. Good thinking, Quick Draw. Why don't you exit stage basement and pursue the quest for wood? Just a teeny-weeny minute there. Me go to the basement alone? By myself? - In this old house? - Why don't we all go? Then we could all carry more wood. It has been said that there is safety in numbers. You be one. You be two. And I'll be three. And I'll be a son of a gun. If that ain't some fancy figurin'. [chuckling] We better find the kitchen, dear old dad. You know, to see if there's an icebox for our refreshments. You've done it again, o' son of mine. And there's nothing like keepin' the refreshments fresh. Now let's keep the ornaments comin', Boo Boo boy. This is gonna be a Christmas tree that's nice to see. - Y-a-y. - You're right, Yogi. (Augie) 'This whole house won't look quite so creepy as before.' - Uh-oh, this box is empty. - Here let me help. Oh, thanks. [chuckles] Why, at first everyone thought this place was haunted. [chuckling] [chuckling] Uh, say... who are you? Oh, uh, I'm Casper, the friendly ghost. The ghost? Yeow! Ah-ah, help! Yow! Hold it. (stammering) Yogi, uh, ah-ah, g-ghost. Now, just take it easy, Boo Boo. A-a-ah, it's just a little fellow out there.. ...uh, celebrating Halloween a bit late. Please, I wanna be your friend. I'd like to join your party. It may be the last one this old house has. Since it's a Christmas eve, I guess there's always room for one more friend. [chuckling] Gee, thanks. [chuckling] However, I feel I should warn you about my friend Hairy Scary. Y-a-y, enough of this ghost play. We got a tree to decorate. - Let's get going. - Right away, Yogi. Yes, sir. This ice cold snow should do the trick nicely, Augie, my boy. Right, dear old dad. I'll go see if I can help Yogi and Boo Boo. [chuckling] That's my boy. A chip off the old blockhead. [chuckling] Ho-doodley-doo. Who-who're you? Make that w-what are you? Well, I'm not Sanity Claus. I'm a ghost. [growling] Uh, ah-ah-ah, a ghost! Yeow! Run for your life, son, there's a giant ghost in the kitchen. He's bigger than both of us. A giant g-ghost? Even bigger than that, he's big-big-big. Ho-ho-ho. My favorite kind of food. Food. Ha-ha-ha.. Hairy Scary, how dare you scare my new friends? Why, it's easy, kid, when you know how. Ha-ha-ha.. Oh, Hairy. You're impossible. (Augie) 'Is this your giant ghost, dear old dad?' [chuckling] Careful son, he's big, big, he's.. ...shrunk. Now, what's all the shouting about? Oh, I see you met Casper, the friendly little Halloween kid. Casper? Imagine me being scared of a cute little kid like this. Y-a-y. Enough of this chit-chat. - There is work to be got at. - That's right, Yogi. You-know-who will be coming soon. You-know-who? You mean Santa Claus? That's right, little fella. Why, he visits us every year. Golly, then there really is a Santa Claus. And I'm going to see him. Well, I think we rounded up enough firewood to last us for the night. We'll load up and get out of this eerie basement. It gives me the creeps. I'm with you. Let's scurry upstairs.. ...or downstairs.. ...or in my lady's chamber even, any exit will do-o.. Here you go, Quick Draw. And here you go, Snagglepuss. You, Quick Draw. And you, Snagglepuss. Golly, there's nothing left for me to carry. Who might you be, stranger? It's not who I might be, it's who I am. You wouldn't be the Ghost of Christmas Past, now, would you? 'Like, out of Dickens?' I am the ghost of Christmas now. And I'm gonna scare the dickens out of you. [growling] He said he would, and he did. - Yeow! A ghost! - Let me out of here. Gangway! Let me out of here! (Snagglepuss) Out of the way then! Hold it. Hold it! Not to panic. Oh, you guys look like you've seen a ghost. Heavens to nervousness, we did. We d-i-d.. A real-life giant ghost. He scared the dickens out of us. [chuckling] Take it easy, boys. Take it easy. What you saw was a little kid wearin' a sheet by the name of Casper. Don't go away. 'I'll bring the cute little fellow up and show you.' [Doggie Daddy chuckling] See, what did I tell you? [growling] I think I'll do a Snagglepussian exit. That-a-way or any old way. [growling] Well, there it is, gang. The Christmas tree is trimmed to a T. (Boo Boo) 'It's sure pretty, Yogi.' It's more beautiful than I ever dreamed it could be. (Quick Draw) Let's get out of here. - Run for your life. - This place is haunted. Not only fairies but ghosts. Guys, simmer down. Y-a-y, what's all this about? [Hairy laughing] (Hairy) 'I'll tell you what it's all about.' You can just take all this Christmas foolishness and clear out of here. [ululating] No, please, Hairy. Stop. (Hairy) 'Ba-ah! Christmas. Phooey!' [Hairy growling] (Hairy) Sanity Claus. [growling] Tree ornaments! (Hairy) 'Out! Out!' Ha! So much for that foolishness. [laughing] This is more like it. Since these are the last few days I'm gonna spend in this old house I'll spend it the wayI wanna. Haunting people. Hey, kiddo, how was I, huh? Pretty good, huh? Hey, kiddo. Hey, Casper, where'd you go? Hey, the kid must have taken off with the rest of 'em. Oh, well, who needs him? Sanity Claus. Huh! Believing in Sanity Claus makes a kid selfish. It's, "I want this and I want that." Hey, a stocking. And if I'm not mistaken complete with a list of "I want this' and I want thats'. Ho-ho-ho. Let's listen to this. (Casper) 'Dear Santa, if you should happen to come by this way' 'I have but one wish for Christmas.' 'Please save Hairy's house.' "Please save Hairy's house"? [stammering] Why, that kid asked for something for me. [sniffling] Why that little son of a gun! I should have known he wouldn't be selfish. He's my friend. My friend. Gosh, a ghost does have friends. Too bad there isn't a Sanity Claus. The kid's going to be disappointed. Hey. I got it! (Hairy) 'Oh boy! Oh boy! Some kid, that Casper.' 'Why, I'll show him a Christmas that he'll never forget.' 'If it's not too late.'

Heavens to happiness, new leotards I got. Hey, hey! A brand new pair of spurs that jingles jangle like that. Y-a-y! Look here, Boo Boo, how about that? A brand new hat. Thank you, Santa Claus. Everyone is more than happy with their gifts. Ahem. Excuse me, Santa, did you get my note? Note? Note? Oh, yes, the note. Ho-ho-ho. Hairy Scary, Hairy Scary? Hairy, Santa has something for you. Oh, I'm afraid. I'm afraid. Ho-ho-ho. You're afraid of me? Hairy, Hairy, I have a special gift for you. A gift for me? Oh boy! Oh boy! What do you know, just what I needed, nothing. - Nothing? - Unfold the box, Hairy. Well, I'll be doggonedly gone. - 'Ho-ho-ho.' - 'What's it say, Hairy?' I'll read it. "This house is from now on and forever the property of Hairy Scary, to live in as long as he wants." [all cheering] Oh, and Hairy, there will be no need for that bulldozer parked out there. [cheering] And from now on.. ...this house shall be known as Hairy's Haunting Lodge. [all cheering] Listen up, folksie-doksie. From now on, every Christmas Casper and I want all of you friends to spend Christmas Eve with us. Y-a-y. Hairy Scary, you sure are neat. There's a big heart after all under that sheet. [chuckling] We wouldn't miss it for nothing. That's right, dear old dad. It will be, indeed, a pleasure. Wild horses couldn't keep us away. We'll bring all. Look, Santa Claus is leaving. On, Dancer. On, Prancer. Oh, my gosh! I forgot to thank him. Thanks, Sanity Claus. Thanks. (growling) And Merry Christmas. (Santa Claus) 'Whoa! Whoa! Steady, hold it.' [sleigh bells jingling] Oh, boy, I forgot myself. I hope Santa will forgive me. I'm sure he will, Hairy. After all, Christmas is forgiving. [chuckling] (all) Merry Christmas. [sleigh bells jingling]
