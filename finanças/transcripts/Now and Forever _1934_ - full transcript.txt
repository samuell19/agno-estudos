That'll be right up. Just a minute. Thank you. Good morning, Occidental. I cannot ring suite 1026 before 11:30. I'm sorry, sir. Never before 11:30. Accounting Department. C.O.D. for 1026. Mail for 1026. For 1026? Well, why didn't you tell me? Oh, stupid! Nice ham. You said that in Vienna. Not about ham. Most certainly about ham. That was Wiener Schnitzel. I remember distinctly arguing about the relationship of a cow to a calf. Jerry, you're an idiot. You said that in Vienna. And London and Rome and a few other places. Say, was that a party last night! Didn't I tell you we'd have a great time in China? Mmm. You certainly did. Let me see. What was I last night? It was something special. Oh, sure. I was Emperor of All China. Mmm. The Emperor of All China. Emperor, there's a little message for you. Some of your subjects are getting a little restless. Would that be, by any chance, the bill? Good morning, Emperor. Have we been here three weeks? We have, and we've had a swell time. Now I suppose you haven't the $800. Will you have some more ham, Emperor? Have faith, little one. I have, but not $800 worth. Hey, there is a time for fooling. You've always said there was no time for anything but fooling. Well, who am I to disturb a genius? I'm not hungry, either. Is it the fire escape? It looks like the old boy has got to go to work. Any ideas, may I ask? My dear, you're talking to a businessman. You ought to know that by this time. Hmm. I do. But $805 is a record! Who do you love? My emperor. Always brings home the bacon, doesn't he? Always. Uh... we mustn't mix pleasure with business. Just as you say, dear. And what is my little woman fixing for dinner tonight? It's probably right there. Uh, as a matter of fact, just between you and me, we may dine on a boat tonight. You know how it is. We like to move. Don't we though? Good-bye, little woman. Good-bye, Emperor. Good morning, Mr. Day. Good morning, Mr. Ling. Mr. Day, it is, indeed, most disagreeable to me, but... Yes? I need not impress upon you the urgency of, uh, well, your bill. Oh, no need at all. As a matter of fact, I am expecting the auditor today. It will be very awkward for me if, uh... Oh, uh, the auditor. I understand. As it happens, I was just on my way downstairs now. I'll see you later, Mr. Ling. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Mr. Ling. Thanks. Hmm. Thank you. Hello. Occidental Hotel? The manager, Mr. Ling, please. The desk clerk at Hotel Sino Manor speaking. Mr. Ling? The auditor is here, sir. Yes, we'll show him every courtesy. Yes. Yes, sir. Mr. Ling conveys his compliments, Mr. Daly, and says he will come over whenever you wish to see him. Er, my very best compliments to Mr. Ling... and, uh, tell him there's no hurry whatsoever. I have a great deal to do. As a matter of fact, I'd rather not see Mr. Ling till evening. I'm the assistant manager. Consider us all at your command. Oh, thank you. And, uh, will you have the ledgers sent up? I expect to be very busy and I don't wish to be disturbed. Yes, sir. Boy, Suite 205. This way, sir. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Mr. O'Neil, please. Room 327. Mr. O'Neil. I'm merely fulfilling my obligation to this firm. But I must ask you to meet your bill immediately. Why haven't... But I haven't the money! Mr. O'Neil, uh... In a situation like this we make great allowances for cash. Well, Mr. Daly, if I had any cash, I... I might dig up 50. For a hundred we'll cancel the whole bill. It's a deal. Mrs. Frank Newman, please. Uh, Room 425. Let's see, 500. One, two, 350 makes $850. That's right. Thank you. I'm going to the Sino Manor Hotel. The auditor is there. Oh, good afternoon, Mr. Day! Good afternoon, Mr. Ling. I hope you have enjoyed your stay with us. Good day, Mr. Ling. Put them down here. Whee! Well, we made it. Again. I've decided to write a book: "My Breathless Years." Will I be in it? Mmm. Yes, but I don't think you'll stay long. I'll kill you off early. Not getting tired of it all, by any chance? Never a dull moment, darling. Good girl. Mmm. Here, you forgot these this morning. By the way, where are we going? Boat stops at Yokohama first. We'll see how we feel when we get there. I was afraid of that. Well, well, well! This is different. Toni. What? Darling, we're rich. Again? That's nice. Hmm. This letter's from my brother-in-law. He's been, uh, looking after the baby. Baby? Yeah, listen. What baby? My baby. Wait a minute, Jerry. You mean that you have a child? That's right. Didn't I tell you? No. She must be five or six by now. I don't know exactly. Well, for a man who talks so much, you say very little. I- I told you I was married. Yes. She died some time ago. Oh. The point is, my wife's family... want to deny me the privilege of parenthood. I've been looking for that brother-in-law of mine for a long time... and now he wants my baby. Well, he's gonna get her. And it'll cost him exactly $75,000. Jerry. Seventy-five thousand dollars. Tsk, tsk, tsk. What a beautiful world. We'll take the first boat out of Yokohama to San Francisco, hop a plane to... Hey, do you realize we've never been in New York together? Mmm. Why, darling, it's gonna be marvelous. You and I in New York? Why, it's... it's... The black ten on the red ten. Of course, we'll have to stop off in Connecticut first to, uh, pick up the money. My wife's family live there, which is practically the only thing wrong with Connecticut. Who do you love? Jerry, don't go to Connecticut. Why, how else can we get the money? Don't get it. I don't understand. Jerry, don't even want to go. Oh, now I'm getting it. Not a nice way to make money, huh? Not a bit nice. Hmm. I didn't know we were nice. Think of New York. That'll be nice. I'm leaving for Paris in the morning. You mean... You mean you'll meet me in Paris when I come back? I don't know. You're tired of chasing trains is what you really mean. Jerry, you once said we belong because we both hated life. Neither of us knew what we wanted. We've had three years. Are we any nearer to knowing? I'll answer that by asking you: Do you wish we were settled down and it were our kid? Do you? No. I don't think I do either. But I wish we wanted to. You're tired of chasing trains, all right. Jerry... don't go! She is your child! You can't take advantage of that. She's yours! But 75,000 bucks is 75,000 bucks. Well, you're the emperor. Then you'll meet me in Paris? I'll know that when I'm in Paris. Well, you're the empress. Good night, Empress. We need scarcely point out that your mode of life... is not one that fits you to bring up a child... my sister's child. Just as stuffy as ever in here. Ah. However, I have no desire to... I have no desire to criticize your mode of life. Oh! No, no! We are... We are concerned only with the welfare of the child. Of course. Therefore, I have had Mr. Clark draw up a document. You agree to surrender the child. I agree to adopt her. That's a lot of words. How long would it take a lawyer to say "the black cat of my aunt has 18 kittens"? Really, Mr. Day, I... This is no time for levity. When does the levity begin around here? Are we to understand that you refuse Mr. Higginson's generous offer without even... Considering the type of person we have to deal with, we thought it might come to that. You knew it would come to that. How much do you want? Seventy-five thousand dollars. Why, that's ridiculous! An outrage! Blackmail. I won't be held up this way. I told you he was a scoundrel. Oh. So you've told him. And I'll give you 20,000... and not another penny. Well? Magnificent, hmm? You know, we can manufacture these... for almost nothing and sell them at the five-and-ten; make a fortune. No charge for the idea. Ah, I take it I'm not invited for lunch, so I'll move along. I'll be out in the garden when you make up your mind to pay me the 75,000. Oh, 40,000, then. Five years ago when you removed me from the family, you called me a blackguard and a cad. Forty thousand will just pay for the "blackguard." The "cad" will cost you 35,000 more. Make up your mind, and don't take too long about it. You see, Mr. Cosgrove, the gypsy chief... asked me if you wouldn't like to have his gypsies camp on your lawn. It's too bad, Mr. Cosgrove, that the noise disturbed you. But you see, sometimes they have the most marvelous parties, and hundreds of gypsies come from Spain and every place. They have such a good time that they forget... Hello. Uh, I'm looking for an old friend of mine, a Mr. Cosgrove. - Oh, do you know him? - Oh, very well. Uh, may I sit down there with you? Please do. Having any fun today? I've been sailing my boat around the island. I wanted to see where the pirates camped last night. Uh, do you keep your sailboat padlocked to the dock so the pirates can't steal it? No. Uncle George keeps it padlocked... so I won't sail it alone. He's afraid. You see, I didn't really sail around the island, not honor bright. Honor bright? You can only say that when it's honest-to-goodness true. Oh. Where did you learn that? From my mother. You see, pirates are true, all right, but not honor-bright true. Oh, of course. What's your name? Jerry. Mine is Pennie Day. Mmm. I had an idea it might be. Are you a good sailor? I could be. Honor bright. But he won't let me. Why not? Uncle George just doesn't believe in people having fun. Mmm. I've noticed that. Let's go sailing. Oh, I'd love it! But... I learned a magic trick about padlocks in India. Really? Honor bright? Honor bright. Hocus-pocus. Dominocus. Ha ha ha! Uh, should we take Mr. Cosgrove along? Of course. You'll come, won't you, Mr. Cosgrove? Sit right there, Mr. Cosgrove. Whoa, oh! Be careful, Mr. Cosgrove! There. What is it? So this is their island, huh? Yes. And we'll have to be very careful. They may be hiding in the woods. Ooh. Where did you see them hide the treasure? Right over there. Right there? I forgot to tell you. Last night the pirates came and took the treasure away. Hmm. You're Pennie Day, all right. Well, there may be some left. Come on, let's both dig. You dig there. See? You dig there. Look! Look what I found! Chinese money! The treasure! Sure enough! Look! Why, a shilling. We'd better hurry. The enemy's coming. It's been a wonderful adventure. The best I've had in a long time too. We'll have to surrender now. I wish we'd brought some guns along. Good-bye, Jerry. Good-bye, Pennie. What have you got in your hand? Nothing... much. Open your hand. Hmm. Why can't you let her alone? I insist on being obeyed. Now go to your room at once. Afraid she might be having a little fun, huh? It's discipline she needs, not fun. Well, I've decided to make you a final offer... final... of $60,000. Poor child. I said $60,000. Listen, my dear brother-in-law. You've always had the idea that it was your duty... to run other people's lives. You wrecked your sister's! You've pretty well kicked mine over. You wanna keep the fun out of Pennie's. You've got the gall to think Elsie could have been happy with you? She was, so long as you left us alone, Hmm. Impossible as that may seem, my dearJason. You got away with your interfering before, but not now. Pennie. Oh, all right, 75,000, then. Pennie! Think of that child! I am. Pennie? I'm your father. Oh, I knew it! I knew it! Miss Day, this is New York. We're gonna wrap it up, tie a string around it and take it home with us. And, uh, we'll take these too. And this? Yeah. W-We'll have that. And, uh... Here! Here! Here! But Daddy, I wanna put it on. You'll, uh... I'll take her into the fitting room. Come, dear. Just a moment, please. Transfers. I'm saving them. See? I use them for money. Hmm. I haven't tried that yet. Is it anything serious, Doctor? Nothing that a dose of castor oil can't remedy. Castor oil? You mean... You mean I gotta give her castor oil? Yes, I do. She'll have to keep regular hours and eat the proper food. I'm going to send her a diet which will not include hot dogs. See that she follows it. And I'm gonna send you a book. You can use some information on the bringing up of a child. It's quite a job, you know. Yes. Well, thank you, Doctor, for straightening us out. Not at all. Good night. Good night, dear. Good night. He was pretty mad at you, wasn't he, Daddy? Yeah. Drug store, please. My dear young woman, life is not just a round of pleasure. We must take the bad with the good. This is the bad and this is the good. Castor oil, I know. Now, you take a spoonful of this and I'll show you what that is. All right. I'll take it. But I'll keep my eyes shut. It reminds me of Uncle George. No need to take this thing so seriously. Oh. Oh, he's elegant. Are you... Are you sure you like him? I'm just crazy about him. I'm awful crazy about you too, Daddy. I've had such a good time. Hmm. Well, now... now you go to sleep. I'll be in the next room if you want me. Good night, Daddy. You see, Mr. Cosgrove, he doesn't realize... that I'm too old to have a teddy bear. Why, I gave up playing with such things years ago, Mr. Cosgrove. You stay there. These samples just arrived this morning. They look pretty good, don't they? Oh, yes. They, uh, they certainly do. Now, these are from the... face of the new crosscut on the, uh, 120-foot level. H- Have you had them assayed yet? Here are the reports. Uh, oh, yes. I had my attorney draw up the option. Uh... Oh, I didn't know you had company. Oh, come in, my dear. Come in. All right. Come on in, dear. This is my daughter, Mr. Evans, Penelope, known as Pennie. Young man, why haven't you told me about her before? Oh, we've always had so much business to discuss. That's no excuse! She's far more interesting than business. How are you, my dear? Quite well, sir. Now. Now? Oh, bless me. Have you been ill? Too many hot dogs and banana splits, I'm afraid. I'm never gonna do that again. Now, run right along, darling. Oh, no. Let her stay. Now, we'll get through with this business. Here's my certified check... for $5,000 for the option. Now, if you'll be good enough to sign, I'll consider myself a mining man again. All right. So we had an old-fashioned tummy ache. Did you? I'm afraid it was my own fault. He doesn't know anything about raising children. No! Hmm. But, uh, I'm learning. There you are, sir. Yeah. That's it. Thank you. Good-bye and thank you. Thank you both. Good-bye. Good-bye. I'll look you up at the bank tomorrow. Whew! What's the matter? Nothing! Not a thing. Everything is what is known as jake. And now we're sailing for Europe. Yippee! France gave the Statue of Liberty to the United States. It's awful big. I saw a picture of it once. I didn't think it was so big. And there's an elevator that goes right up to the head and the crown. If you want to, you can get out at the throat, walk out on the shoulders and out on the arms and even the fingers. You mean you can stand up and walk around the fingers? In all of them? Mm-hmm. Even the pinkie? Mm-hmm. Were you ever there? Why, of course. Why, I met one of the most charming people I ever knew right in the thumb. Really, Daddy? Who was he? Why, it was, uh... Mister, uh... Oh, Daddy. Not honor bright. Well, no. Not exactly. Oh, Daddy, there's Mr. Evans. Uh... yes. Shall we take a stroll around the deck? Maybe Mr. Evans would like to come with us. No, I don't think... - Mr. Evans! Mr. Evans. - Ho, ho! Pennie! Why, this is a pleasant surprise. Daddy was surprised too. He's over there. See him? He's looking for us. Here we are, Daddy. Yes. An unexpected pleasure, Mr. Day. Mmm. Quite. I owe you an explanation. You see, I had a message calling me to Europe suddenly. So I made arrangements with my attorney to meet you at the bank in the morning. Quite a coincidence, Mr. Day, because the same thing happened to me... and I instructed my attorney to be there in my place. Good day. Hello! Is that what you was looking for? Oh! I nearly forgot. Does she look like me? Jerry. The name is, uh, Pennie. Pennie, this is Toni. - How do you do? - How do you do? Pennie, this is, well, sort of your new mother. And Toni, this is, uh... Well, I guess you'd sorta say our new daughter. Huh? Mmm. I guess you would. Well, you two girls oughta get along swell. - Shall we go now, Daddy? - Oh, no. No. Wait a minute. Uh... Toni's going with us. - Yes, Daddy. Please. - No, no. We gotta get the bag. Merci, monsieur. Hello, my boy. Where are you staying? Uh... I haven't decided yet. I'll look you up at the bank tomorrow. At the bank? Good-bye, Pennie. Good-bye, Uncle Felix. And who is Uncle Felix? He's a good friend of ours. We like him. He bought one of Daddy's gold mines. Come on, you women. This is no place to stand and gab. Well, here we are. I suppose you'd like to bathe. Can I help you? Thank you. I can manage alone. Well, I should say she can. She's a very competent young lady. She's my daughter. In there, Pennie. Well. Well, what happens now? What do you mean, dear? "What happens?" I mean, what happens now? Oh, you mean, what happens? Yes. What happens? Why, nothing. I- I mean... You mean nothing. No, I don't mean that at all. I mean... Lookee here, Toni. I know what's eating you. You think I haven't any business with that kid. Well, you're wrong. Dead wrong. You haven't a thing to worry about. You wait and see. I see. And, what's in the past is completely past. Exactly. No more beating debts or dodging gentlemen in uniforms, chasing trains. No more hurried departures from unpleasant scenes. Not a chance. Your only concern is for your daughter's future. And you want above everything to make her happy. Absolutely, dear. So you sold Uncle Felix the phony gold mine to get the money for the good time. Stop lying, Jerry. Lying? Yes. Stop lying. It doesn't become you. I know exactly what you were thinking. Fun, excitement, thrills! You wouldn't know responsibility if you fell over one in the street! Well... suppose it was just that. What difference does it make? Just this: You've got to mean it. You're her father, and she's yours. So you've got to quit selling gold mines. You can't take a child out of a good home and throw her into a life like this. Hey! Wait a minute, Toni. What do you mean by "a life like this"? Your idea of how life should be lived: Cheap and gaudy and shallow. Have you found it like that? Sometimes. Now we're getting someplace. You're not talking about Pennie. You're talking about yourself. That isn't so. Stop lying, Toni. It doesn't become you either. I took you into that kind of life. I wanted to go. And in exchange for a decent husband I gave you a guy... who deals in phony gold mines. That's what you're talking about. You wouldn't have done this to this child when we started. And if we've made ourselves that sort of people, where do we end up? We won't be very pretty people, will we? We won't even like ourselves very much. Where will that be? Because we won't be young anymore either. This turns gray someday. Wrinkles come in, hips go out. We won't have anything else to hold us together because we won't be that kind of people. Pretty, isn't it? Only it's a picture you'll never see. Because if you can't convince me that you're through with gold mines, I'm through! Yes, I'm through, Mr. Emperor! The China Walls are all yours. I've danced enough on top of them. I want some peace. You're right, Toni. I was lying, and you knew it. Well... I'm not lying now. I don't want to quit. Ajob? Not me. I don't want any peace. Peace is what they call "life" out there... and I don't like life any better than I ever did. Nothing can make me settle down. Nothing. Well, you've had enough of it... and I don't blame you. You want peace. Well, go out and get it. You know what you want and I know what I want. At least we know that much, even if we... couldn't find the secret between us. So that's... good-bye... and good luck. Wait a minute. I guess I should have known... if I... I want you, that I'll have to take you as you are. I don't like it, Jerry. But I've been without you for a long time... and I like that less. So I know what I want and I don't get it. So I'm gonna get the next-best thing. I'm going to sell gold mines and chase trains with you for as long as you want me. And if the trains wind up in rather ugly places, why, that's all right too. We'll both be there together. Well, that wins. I guess now I'm gonna get a job. I guess I'd be anything you want, Toni, if you love me that much. Don't say it unless you mean it. Who do you love? Daddy. Something's caught. And I've been standing on my head, almost. Let me do it. Thank you. I am very glad to meet you. I guess I should have said that at the station. And so should I. I'm sorry. Well, well, well. That's better. We're gonna have a lot of fun, we three. No. I mean, uh... Well, that is... But, Toni, you know. One moment, Mrs. Bradbury. Are you Mr. Day? Right. Ah, glad somebody knows it. Was it you who rented a house yesterday to a Mrs. Bradbury? I'll say I did, and it took me all day to do it. Well, the day wasn't long enough. You didn't rent it. It's got a blue tile bathroom, and she doesn't want it. Stop kidding. Let her do the kidding. She's on the phone now. Hello! Yes, Mrs. Bradbury. Uh, well, I didn't notice it was blue either, but isn't that all right? Uh, I don't think I understand, Mrs. Bradbury. Why can't you bathe in blue surroundings? Isn't the sea blue? Well, what color were you looking for? You prefer pink? But, uh, what's the other color? Well, that's a fine house you're fixing up, Mrs. Bradbury. After all, a bathroom's a bathroom. You don't live in it. Oh, yes, yes. We have others. I guess. Why don't... Well, I don't know exactly. Uh, I'm going out to lunch now. Well, maybe. Later sometime. Yes. I'll call you. Yes. Just as soon as I get around to it. Yes. Good-bye. Ah, hello. Oh, hello, Mr. Evans. How are ya? Oh, no. No, no. Not Mr. Evans. Uncle Felix. Well, what are you doing down here? How did you find me? Oh, I... I just happened to be here. And yesterday I was passing by when you left. I thought it was you, but I wasn't quite sure. And how's my little Pennie, huh? Never better. Delightful child. That reminds me. I promised to buy her a present on the boat. I wonder if you'll do me a favor and come with me while I get it for her now. I don't know. It's bothered me quite a bit. She's forgotten all about that. I haven't. Now, come along. Come along, and then we'll have a spot of lunch afterwards. Well, all right. Now look. Oh, that's too good for her. It's got a diamond. Yes, I know. That's just what I want. Oh, I'm a nut on diamonds. Besides, nothing's too good for Pennie. It'll certainly make a hit. I- I'll take that one. Tres bien, monsieur. About half a carat, that diamond. Wouldn't you say? Just about. Oui, monsieur. And a Blue Ridge, if I'm not mistaken. Oui, monsieur. I see you know something about diamonds. As a matter of fact, I do. A man must know about something. One man may know about, uh, gold mines... and, uh, another man may know about diamonds. Now, there. There's a tray of diamonds. Right again. I think some of these... are the finest stones I've ever seen. Yes. A genuineJager. Oui, monsieur. Look, Day. It's all right. Even I can tell it's pretty good. Pretty good? Pretty good is right. Yeah. Lend me your handkerchief for a moment, will you? Here, thank you. Now look. Look at it now. Mmm, what a sweetheart. A sweetheart, a companion and a... That's about all there is to it, monsieur. I will wrap this up. Oh, no, no, no. Don't bother. I'll take it just as it is. There it is. And thank you. Not at all, my dear boy. Not at all. Now what about that spot of lunch? I... Oh. What's the trouble? Don't you hate to get something in your eye? What are you looking for? A handkerchief? Here. You haven't got one. Oh, thank you. Huh. And what is that? That's a diamond. A few minutes ago, it was reposing in its tray. Now in its place is another diamond, but not a genuineJager. I didn't think that the salesman would notice the difference, but, uh, if he had, this little sparkler would have been found upon you, my dear boy, and not upon your dear, old Uncle Felix. I don't get one item. Why did you let me put it over on you in New York? Because I was quite sure that one day I would get my money back... with interest. Suppose you turn right around and repeat that slight-of-hand act. There's nothing in my eye, and if I'm not mistaken, that's a cop down there. You don't want to talk to a cop anymore than I do. And that is why, my dear boy, I let you swindle me. So when this day came, you couldn't call a cop. Hmm. Now, what about that lunch? Well, let's stop at the casino first and get a drink. You're talking my language more every moment. Well, here's mud in your eye. You know, I never knew what that meant. Well, I didn't either until... today. Down the hatch. Yes. So you really retired? I have. Happy? Very. And you make, uh, what? Thirty-five a week. Well, a man can live on that. Sure. Have you made many friends since you've been here? No, not many. Oh, that's a pity. Lovely people. Tell me. Do you, by any chance, know that woman over there? No. She seems the type of woman that might interest me a great deal. An unusual personality. I can see it from here. Yes, I can see it too. I should like to meet her very much indeed. I think we might have a great many tastes in common. Jewels, for instance. Can't you see us at a little table discussing her jewels? Well, I'm thinking the jewels might get pretty bored. I don't think they'd be around very long. Oh, that's charming! We'll have another on that. Bartender? Yes, sir? What has happened? There must be thieves about. Huh? No, no. That isn't what I told you. That's where you always go wrong. That's exactly what you told me. Now don't tell me wrong then. Don't show me anymore. I want to do it all myself. There's just no use at all. You'll never get it, and you just won't listen. Here, here, Pennie. You shouldn't talk like that. Why shouldn't she? And what business is it of yours? Daddy! Daddy! So, you're her father. That's different. You're Mrs. Crane, aren't you? I am. How did you know? Why, Pennie, she must have... Yes, she should have. How nice. So is she. Well, I must go. Should have gone long ago, if I had any sense. Good-bye, old-timer. Good-bye. And you practice! I will. Good-bye. Good-bye. It's time to go to bed, dear. Mmm, all right. No, I meant Pennie. Is it really? Doesn't the time go fast? It certainly does. Good night, Daddy. Good night, sweetheart. Good night, Toni. Good night, darling. Don't forget, Daddy. I won't. - Honor bright? - Honor bright. Forget what, dear? Daddy's coming in and wash my back. Good night. Good night. Good night. Jerry. Yes, dear. It's all right about Pennie's school? The money, I mean. We still have it? Uh, yes. Of course, dear. What I mean is, it isn't too expensive, the one we picked out, is it? It'll be all right. A model father's got to give his child the best, doesn't he? You know best, Emperor. Jerry. Yes, dear. Am I dumb? What? Am I dumb to think we're both happy because I am? What are you talking about? I was never so happy in all my life. Please be. Don't you worry about that. Say! Take a look at this. Was today payday or wasn't it? I ask you. There's $35 here. Can't a guy get a raise? Gotta buy a little ivy now and then. Oh, Jerry. Who do you love? You're not so hot, young fellow. I'm not even warm. Thank you. Well, what's the matter? Been losing too much? Well, you can't hit 'em all the time. Thank you. Mr. Day, just what is your business? I believe I told you real estate. Oh, don't get huffy. I'm so old and so rich, I can say anything I want to say without any of this fiddle-faddle. And Pennie. Doesn't she get in your way sometime? Pennie? Yes. Now, look here. It's none of my business... but I think there's something phony about you, young man. I've taken the trouble to ask a lot of questions about you. You don't make much money and you spend a lot. Now that sounds like adventure to me. And if that's true, Pennie will get in your way someday. And when she does, I want to take her. But... Now, don't interrupt! I'm kind of a lonely, old coot. I've plenty of money and no one to spend it on. And that child is the only human being I've ever found... that I'd like to have around me as long as I live. I can make life perfectly swell for her too. And I'd like to do it, because I happen to have fallen in love with her. If I was offended before, I'm not now, but I don't think that day will ever come. Well, you never... There's one thing you can do for me, though. She's going to school next week, isn't she? Yes. I'd like her to spend her last weekend with me. That means, I suppose, I'll have to ask you too. But I'd like to give her a party. That's pretty swell. Well, I'll call your wife. Mr. Cosgrove. Can you imagine? Monsieur? Brandy. Oui, monsieur. Very nice, my dear boy. Very nice, indeed. What's nice? Making the acquaintance of the charming lady with the, uh, Interesting personality. That had nothing whatever to do with you, dear Uncle Felix. She's a friend of Pennie's, and a good one. So am I, or at least I'm trying to be. Indirectly, of course. Why that necklace must be worth, uh, oh... The answer is still no, Uncle. Well, take your own time. How's the $35 a week? Just fine. Thank you. I noticed you were not particularly successful in there. Yeah. A few dollars. It seemed to trouble you a little. Well, if you ever need money, you know where I am. I'm going home, Uncle Felix, and I don't need a thing. Not a thing! You are a rat, Uncle Felix. Yes, I know. Sounds kind of dull to me. Now I think she ought to... paint. She has definite talent for dancing. I think she ought to dance. Paint. Dance. Say, you're pretty excited about this school for Pennie, aren't you? She's the first child I ever sent to school. Why shouldn't I be? No reason. You should be. Well, I can give Mary's bicycle for it. Who said I didn't want it? I'm givin' you real gold for an old pair of skates. They aren't old skates; they're real ball bearings, see? Do you know where gold comes from? No. From a hole in the ground. Way down deep. It takes them a long time to find it. Months. Sometimes even years. That's why it's worth so much money. All right. All right, Buster. Nothing funny about it. No? No. I wouldn't miss this for the world. Hello. Hello. What are you doing? Putting on skates. Where did you get them? Oh, I just got 'em. I think you better give them back, don't you? She gave me this gold for keeps. I don't want 'em back. Let me see. Gold, Pennie? Honor bright, Pennie? Come on, Pennie. Your turn now. # Oh, the world owes me a living # # Deedle, diedle doedle-diedle dum # # Oh, the world owes me a living # # Deedle, diedle doedle-diedle dum # # If I worked hard all day I might sleep better # #When in bed at night # # I sleep all day so that's all right # # Deedle, diedle doedle-diedle dum # # There once was an old grasshopper # # Who could only think of fun # #He looked on work as something # # Too unpleasant to be done # #He loved to sit in the summer sun # #And fiddle all day long # # While dozing there he played this air # #And sing this little song # ## # The north wind blew the leaves away # # When winter came one stormy day # # The snow fell fast upon the ground # #No food nor shelter could be found # # This old grasshopper suddenly # # Could hardly hop for he was weak # #He slipped # #He fell # #Poor chap # #Farewell # #Some ants safe in their hilly home # #Looked out and saw him freezing # #They soaked his feet in mustard sauce # #And he grew better soon # # Now everyday they hear him play # #And sing this little tune # # Oh, I owe the world a living # # Deedle, diedle doedle-diedle dum # # Oh, I owe the world a living # # Deedle, diedle doedle-diedle dum # # I've got a bad cold in my head # #You ants were right the time you said # # "You've got to work for all you get" # # Deedle, diedle doedle-diedle dum ## You'll miss ice cream, Daddy. Why... Why, what are you doing with Grumpy? I was wondering what he was doing back there in the window? He's being punished! He... He gave me that gold. Oh! Maybe I'll forgive him now and take him down to the party. Oh, no! That's a very serious crime. I think we oughta put him way back in a dark closet. He'll be good then, I guess. We'd better put him in your closet, and then we'll get the ice cream. I'm gonna miss you at school. I'll miss you more. You have Toni. But you've got Mr. Cosgrove. I don't give a hoot about the value of the necklace. Gewgaws are all right, but they're not important. It's the fact that somebody stole it. There's a thief around. Oh, I don't think it's any of you. And I don't like this business any better than you do. But it's out of my hands now, so let's get it over with as quickly as possible. Go ahead, Inspector. Do your stuff. Jerry? Yes, dear. Nothing. Look here. I shouldn't be saying this either. But if you know anything about this, I'd like to know. I can call these lads off. And I'd do it too... for the kid. Well, I'd like to help if I could, Mrs. Crane, but, uh, I'm sure this is all we could do. Okay, then. I think it's tommyrot examining a bunch of children. Daddy! He promised to be good, so I brought him down to the party. Oh, he's going to be good, is he? Uh-huh. Hurry. Hurry. And you would please go with the others. All right, you go with them, honey. Uh, shall I take care of Grumpy for you? All right. You may bring him along, if you wish. He was awfully nice, but I don't think he was much of a detective. Why not, dear? Do you know what I'd do if I were a detective? No, what would you do? It's easy. I'd say, "I'm the detective now and I'm asking you questions." I'd say, "Mr. Day, did you steal that necklace?" And you must answer. Oh. Well? Well, what, dear? You must answer. Did you steal that necklace? No, I didn't steal it. Honor bright? You're a funny one! No! You must answer. That's the whole point. Honor bright? Honor bright. And I'd say, "That's all I wanted to know, Mr. Day." See? Hi, Toni! This is a fine time of night for you to be jumping around, young missy. Come here, now. Come on! There you be. Here's Grumpy. What's the matter, Jerry? Oh, nothing. Nothing! It's sleep for you, young lady. Good night, darling. Good night. All right, Toni dear, but leave this on, please. All right, sweetie. Why, Grumpy! What on earth has happened to your neck? Daddy. Daddy. And you said, "honor bright" to me. Oh, don't be nervous. My boy, don't be nervous. This will be out of our hands before the day's over. Sunk without a trace. - Well, it won't hurt my feelings. - Now, run along. And consider that in another day, you'll be very prosperous. All right, Felix. Give my love to Pennie. Listen, Pennie. You gotta tell us the trouble. I'll fix it for you, kid. You know that. You got to tell us, Pennie. Let me alone! Well, she'll tell us when she wants to. You know, dear. You can't force a woman to talk. You oughta know that. Pennie, darling, what is the matter? You must tell me what's troubling you. Come on now. Start at the very beginning. It doesn't make any difference how you say it. How could he touch that teddy bear? Oh, why not, darling? But after what he did? Did what, darling? Who? Tell me, Pennie. What? The necklace. Daddy stole it and hid it in the teddy bear's neck. Pennie. Pennie. You saw him put it there, but he didn't steal it. He was hiding it to protect somebody else. No! I saw him with it. I saw him. Honey, it's true, I tell you. I oughta know, Pennie, because I was the one who stole it. I've always wanted one like it, so I took it. That's all. And when the police came, l- I got frightened and told him. So he hid it to protect me. Don't stare at me like that! Daddy. Daddy. I'm sorry, Daddy. I'm so sorry. - What do you mean? - Toni told me. Toni? Told you what, Pennie? That she stole it. You said "honor bright" and I should have believed you. Please, Daddy. Forgive me. Please. Why... Why, of course. Of course, darling. Lean down. All right, dear. Run along. I heard the news: The big sacrifice scene with Pennie. I don't want any sacrifice scene so... You didn't tell her? No, not yet. Then don't. You saw what it did to her to think it was you, and somebody might as well get something out of this. I see your point. I guess... I must like the sacrifice scene, or I'd have told her, wouldn't I? It's very easy to kid yourself, I find. Well, so now you know. Toni. Don't get one thing wrong: I still love you. You don't need to say anything because there isn't anything left to say. If you'd even told me, but lying. You've lost your size, Jerry. I could never chase trains with a little man. Toni. I do love you. That's very sweet, but we've missed the train. Hello. I- I didn't hear you knock. I- I'm going out. As a matter of fact, I'm in rather a hurry. What is it that you want? The necklace. What? Well. A great many people want that, including Mrs. Crane. But supposing I had it, what makes you think that I'd give it to you? This. Oh, no. Don't be ridiculous. I haven't got it. I'll soon find out. No! No! Wait, wait. I... All right. Very well. Do you see anything by any chance? Where'd you get it? You must have dropped it in the backyard. I've been looking for it ever since it was stolen. I mean... since it was lost. Oh. Now I take great pleasure in returning it to you. That's very nice of you, mister. I thought it my duty to do something for you after the great favor you've done me. I've done you a favor? Yes. Because you don't need to tell me how lucky Pennie is that you want to take care of her. Oh. Do you still want to? I certainly do! Permanently? That's the only way I would consider it now. Then that's the way it will be, so she can grow up into a very lovely lady. You can bet she'll have all there is to give her, young man. I'm sure she will. And now you can put me in your debt again. Just one more favor. What's the matter? Stitch in my side. Side ache. Oh, I get them too. Take a deep breath. I'm saving it. Say. What kind of a liar are you? Pretty good. Here it is. No, the thief didn't return it. There wasn't any thief. They haven't yet discovered the value of safes. If I had, this would have never been hidden in Pennie's teddy bear. Now you can all go back to your places. Oh, Marie. Pack me a grip, please. I'm taking Miss Pennie to school. And I wouldn't leave you if you didn't have Toni. You needn't worry, she's quite able. Pennie. It's time we got the baggage onto the train. All right. Come on. Aren't you getting out, Jerry? What's the matter, Jerry? Nothing. You're hurt! I'm all right. Wait a minute. We're going to the doctor's. Not... After Pennie goes. Don't worry. It's all right. Jerry, you got back that necklace. Something else more important now... about Pennie. She belongs to Mrs. Crane now. Toni, yoo-hoo. Toni. Yes, dear. Does she know? You gonna tell her? Not exactly. Not for a long time. When she's used to being with Mrs. Crane and away from us. Toni! Look. I got it dirty already. When I get back, we'll have dinner together. Thank you for everything. Just a minute. What's all this excitement about? Oh, I just love ya! That's because you're going away. You can't fool me. No, I didn't want to believe you. You know. When you said... Hey! I'm here. Don't I rate some attention? Pennie. I'm going on a long, long trip. And if you don't hear from me, don't worry. Where I'm going, there won't be any way of getting word to you. Where's that, Daddy? Oh, it's a place I've never been before. It's a long way off. You have to take boats and trains... And... and lots of things. Now... now you better get going now. Oh, gee, Daddy. That sounds elegant. Is Toni going? Yes, I think so. Yes, I'm going. You're wonderful, Daddy. Time to go, Pennie. Good-bye, Daddy darling. Write me as soon as you get back. Come along, Pennie. Aux voitures. I'll take very good care of her, Mr. Day. So long, Toni. So long, Daddy. Have a good time. And don't forget, you've got to tell me everything. And now, my friend, for that doctor. No! I think not, Toni. Because we're saying good-bye right here. Jerry, why? I'm gonna beat it, Toni, because that doctor's office means questions. Questions mean the police... and I'm not giving Pennie a jailbird for a father. Not now. I got my size back, and they're not taking that away from me. So... it's chasing trains again and dodging cops. You're not gonna be any part of that. Not anymore. So you better get out of here while the going's good because I'm... I'm on my way. He will be all right now, madame. Thank you. Jerry, dear, I'm... I'm sorry. I'd gone with you chasing trains or anything, but... but you were hurt, and Pennie won't care. Not when she knows how... how swell you've been. Those gentlemen in uniform, huh? That's all right. They... They don't look so bad... close. Not nearly as big as when you're running away from 'em. They look kinda funny to me. It's all right, Empress. Honor bright? Honor bright. What... What could they really do to us?
