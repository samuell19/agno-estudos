What's up, channel? Welcome to my guys! It's your boy... Aliff! Okay, guys, I've returned to the old house in the Ada Hantu ghost video. Look behind me, do you see? But I didn't come alone. I'm not crazy enough to come alone. I came with the usual suspects, my partners-in-crime. Ladies and gentlemen, let's welcome Bariah, Sasha, Talha, and Jimmy! Yeah! Come over here! Why are you standing there? Don't be shy! We don't even have 100 million followers! Come, come, come! You must still remember these faces. Do you see them? Why? Because they were the ones who tried to prank me last time. But in the end, all of us were pranked by the gho... By the devil. But you must be asking, "Why are we all here returning to this haunted house?" Viewers, we are actually here because of Bariah. So let's ask her. Ba, come over here. Come here. Tell the story. What story? About your dream. - To the camera? - Yes, to the camera. Hi. So the story, actually... Two weeks ago, while I was sleeping, I heard someone calling my name. Bariah. Bariah. Bariah. When I opened my eyes, I realized I wasn't in my room anymore. Bariah, my precious one. Come back to me. Don't kill me! Yes, it was just a dream, not even real, but the place seemed so familiar. And just to be sure, I looked through my whole house. And in my search, I found a photo. A photo of me with my late grandma. The location in the photo is the same as in my dream. And actually, the place is a place I played at a lot when I was young. Like a playground The weird thing is, the last time we were here, we never saw that room. Photo, photo. Ba, show the photo. The photo. We have a photo, guys. So it shows that it's not all empty talk. We have proof to show you. Do you see? Look. Okay? And that is the reason why we're here. We're looking for the mysterious room mentioned by Bariah just now. So tonight, I will do it differently. You know me, I never do things the same way. Tonight, I will air everything live. No cuts, no edits. So whatever happens inside, you will get to see it live. And tonight, we will be recorded on three different cameras. This is the first camera. This is the second. And ladies and gentlemen, the last camera, we have the third camera. So tonight, we have three cameras covering all possible angles in the house. I just remembered. Hang on. I have this. Ta-da! This is not any mere thing. See? What's this? Is it a pen? This is not just a pen, Talha. It can translate any language into Bahasa Malaysia. You get it? I'll try it, you watch. How are you? How are you? One more time. Thank you. Thank you. Am I pretty? Am I pretty? Sasha, this is a pen. It's not a boyfriend, you know? It translates. It doesn't answer whether you are pretty or not. Can I try? Idiot. You are adorable Here, let me try. Pig! You are adorable. It's mistranslating. Your pen is not accurate. Guys, can you not corrupt my pen's brain? It's rated U, you know? It's been approved by the LPF. Hang on. What does your pen have to do with our search? Who knows, when we are searching, we meet a Japanese ghost, it can translate for us. - We can communicate. - Don't play around. Okay, let's be serious. Okay, guys, before we go in, I want to remind you to watch this live till the end. Why? We don't even know what's going to happen tonight. We don't even know what's inside. Either we will find Bariah's mystery room, or we will find something else. Come, let's not waste time. Sha, can I stand there? - I don't know. - Ready? Talha, don't play around. Okay. Hurry. All ready? Cameras ready? Okay, let's go. - Aliff, hang on. - What? I have a bad feeling. - What if we see... - If we see what? If we see ghosts like the other day, then what do we do? Please, Jimmy, you have your Feng Shui Master Qi. - You can scan and do your thing. - Not funny! The other day, we didn't know the house was haunted. Now we know the house is haunted. That's my point, Aliff. I... I feel a bit nervous. Nervous, nervous, you're always nervous. We are being serious now. Can you not be an ass? Relax, Bariah. I'm talking about real things, right? And we're on live right now. How many people are watching? We can't retreat now. This thing has gone viral. Okay? Steady on. Let's go. Let's just humor him. Don't get too close. It's so dark. Wouldn't it be easier to use a generator like last time? I don't think I need to scan this house. The Qi is no good. Guys, don't you realize we are live right now? Why would you use a generator? We have flashlights. Looks exactly like the last time when we came. Of course it looks the same. After our case, nobody wanted to enter this house. - Ba, where do we start looking? - Yeah, Ba. We... Who's playing the piano? Maybe Jimmy? Jimmy? I'm right here. Hey... If you're here, then who's playing? I already said, but you guys didn't want to listen. Let's not come here. Let's go before that thing appears. What are you saying? Let's take a look. You want to go see it? Let's go. Aliff, you're crazy. Yes, I am crazy. I'm crazy to... I'm crazy to know. Let's go, guys. We are all here, Aliff. The one that's playing must be a ghost. Ghost? This time we'll look, guys. Is the ghost pretending to be me, or not? Aliff! Aliff! Don't touch me. This is for real, not a prank. Let's not go inside. Relax, we're just looking, not buying. Is that human or a ghost? Why would a human play piano this late at night? Of course it's a ghost. Great, great. There's a ghost. Enough, let's go. Let's go. What are you doing? There's a ghost, great. You're crazy, Aliff. Do you want the whole of Malaysia to see you get murdered live? What's that? Look at that. How is it? What do you think of my ghost-hunting vibe? Is it spooky? Spooky, right? Actually, when I was younger, I could play the piano a little. At the time, my dad had sent me to classes. I was only six years old. At the time, I fantasized about being a famous piano player. And you know, if pretty girls... That's a person. Yeah, what's happening? Looks like a video recording. This girl has no brains. How dare she shoot here? Hey! What are you doing here? Aliff! Eh, you know me? Of course! I'm a big fan of yours! I didn't expect to meet you here! Bariah! Sasha! - Jimmy, Talha, you are here too? - Hi. It's so great. You even know our names? Of course. You were the ones who pranked Aliff in the Ada Hantu video, right? That video is so great. That video is great. Thank you very much. I want to ask you, what are you doing here? There's a tripod, a camera, and that cheap phone. I'm here because of you. Why would you be here because of us? Because I really love the video. I came here to create content. Oh, so you're a YouTuber too? I came to make my own video. Hopefully, it will go viral, like Aliff's video. Hang on, these cameras are yours? Are you in the middle of shooting? We're going live for Aliff's content. Live video? You guys are awesome! Come and join us. We can create content together. Join you? Really? What are you talking about? What's this? What? Hang on, what's your name again? My name is Hana. Hana, Hana, can you go away? Because we are shooting live right now. It's okay to have her join us, Aliff. Right, Jimmy? It's not okay. This live shoot is only for us. She's an outsider. She can't join. Also, she's trespassing, you know? This house belongs to Bariah's grandma. You can't just enter as you please, you understand? But I just want to record a video. You can't, you understand? Bariah doesn't like people trespassing on her property. Right, Bariah? See that? She agrees. Can I just finish my video near the piano? No, you can't. Look at my mouth. You cannot. If you want to shoot here or make a video, you have to write an application letter to Ba. If she approves, then you can shoot here. Understand? Now you pack your stuff and go. Doing as you please. Aliff, that poor girl. What poor girl? She's a trespasser. All trespassers will be prosecuted. Have you never gone to the airport and seen such signs? Look at her. Move faster. You're too slow. Aliff, I didn't expect you to be like this. You shame me in front of everyone. The whole of Malaysia can see me being chased away. This chick, wanna be all emotional. Whole Malaysia, whole Malaysia. Consider yourself lucky we didn't call the police. What's that? Smiling like that, do you think we are spooked? Aliff, go easy on her. You are too rude to her, Aliff. Who cares about her? We are on live. Let's continue. Mukhriz. We are sorry for that interruption. But it's okay. We're continuing with our mission. Bariah, where do we start looking for the mystery room? Let's try near the kitchen. Because the last time we came, we didn't go around those parts. Maybe the room is there. Oh, yes, the kitchen. Come. Did you hear that? You hear it? Yes, but just ignore it. I wasn't the only one to hear it. Hey. Hey... What's this? There's even a doll. This is like some kind of worship. Look. This is like a voodoo doll. Voodoo? It's so scary. Who made this? I know this one. This must be Hana doing. I don't think Hana is the seance type, indulge in voodoo and all this. Jimmy, just one look at Hana, I already know she is definitely a cult follower, that Black Metal 666 one. Look at her clothes. You can tell. She's a YouTuber. YouTubers will do anything to get their content viral. I know because I'm also a YouTuber. Enough, let's extinguish them. This is all blasphemous. - All of them? - Yes. Guys. We can't stay behind. Let's go. This hallway is so weird. It's a dead end. It is. There are no lights, just this Japanese painting. It used to be a Japanese general's house, right? Maybe this is the decoration for that time. Let's move. Let's go. Guys, I know this is off-topic, but Sea Horse items are the best! No, I'm curious. Why are all these things here? I know. This is Hana's handiwork. But her choice of brand is on point. Hana? She can't be cooking here. I think she may have used them in her seance. Can I take them home? Sasha, you're always off-topic. But I'm serious. If you want kitchen items, the Sea Horse brand is really a good choice. What light was that? Maybe lightning? What lightning? We're indoors. You guys... That's why you don't know. Light, when it is shone on reflective things, will bounce or reflect. Were you all in Arts Stream? No. That's why. I took Arts Stream. Enough, let's continue. I don't feel too good about all these things. Let's put them back. - We can't take them? - Enough. Guys. Guys, I think we have to stay here for now. But you said to go upstairs. I just remembered that we haven't discussed what to do if we see ghosts. Aliff. What's this, Aliff? I'm just saying "if." Okay, so what's your plan? Okay. Sasha, Chinese people, if they see ghosts, what do they do? Chinese people? Ah, okay. If we see ghosts, we will scream loudly. Scare the ghosts. Like how? Anything. Like... And then? The ghosts will be scared and will go away. Okay, so like this. What if anybody spots a ghost, scream... And then, whoever hears it, go help. Okay, I understand. If anybody spots a ghost, we scream... - I agree. - I agree too. Okay, let's go upstairs. You said we're going to discuss it. We've discussed it. Let's go. Look. Hey. What is she doing? Why is she looking at us like that? So scary. Where is she going? Who cares? Leave her be. Let's go. This room is quite scary. - You guys, look for that room. - What's that? - The store. - Guys. Why does this room feel scarier than before? Don't say that. Hey. It's not here. What are we going to do, Ba? Only the backstage room is left. Let's look there. You think so, Ba? Surely those guys must have found it if it's there, right? It's okay. Let's just try to look. Who knows if it's there, right? Let's go Aliff, you don't want to see under the bed? Farah is there. Ba, you want to sleep here? You want to? I don't. So spooky. Let's look faster. I don't feel too good. We have yet to find it, but we are still trying. Maybe it's here. Guys, found it? Not here, Aliff. - Guys, I think I found it. - What? Guys, it looks like we have found something. Let's go see it. Help me move this. - Guys, we found the mystery room. - So weird. It's weird that those kids didn't see this door. Maybe they didn't notice because of this mirror. That's the past, Sha. What's past is past. Here, the thing in front of our eyes is good. Let's go. Aliff, no need to open the door. There must be a reason why the mirror was put in front of it. Jimmy is right, Aliff. We don't know what's inside, right, Jimmy? Because we don't know, we must make an effort to know. Let's go in. There's no need. I have a bad vibe about this. Maybe there's a zombie or a vampire in there. You're talking nonsense, Jimmy. Dracula, Zombie, Vampire. What say you open the door, Ba? Are you scared? I'm scared? Me, scared? Viewers, this is Ba's grandma's house, right? She wants to locate the mystery room, so we let her open the door. Wow. That's such a good reaction, Ba. Like an actor from the 7:30 p.m. TV dramas. Not funny, Aliff. Ba, what did you see? Sasha! Ba! It's locked! Let's try the front door. Jimmy! Talha! Ba, why did you faint at this moment? It's locked too! Let me try. What should we do? We'll try the back door, through the kitchen. Let's go. Hurry, hurry! Talha! Hurry up! Here, here! Jimmy, I think we are trapped here. Talha, where's that voodoo doll? All the kitchenware is also gone. Who took them? How would I know? So what are we going to do now? Relax, don't look like that. Don't be scared. I'm here. I think we have to look for Aliff, Ba, and Sha first, okay? - No. - What? They will look for us. We'll wait here. You're right. Right, I agree. - Agree? - Agree. Let's wait here. Bariah. Why are you so heavy, Bariah? Why does this house have to have stairs? You know, Bariah? You're so heavy. Heavy. Hana! Thank God I found you. You have to help me. All my friends are trapped in that house. That house is really haunted. It keeps on playing Auld Lang Syne. Hana, what's wrong? Are you angry at me? Okay, I'm sorry on Aliff's behalf, okay? I don't agree with his actions. I'm sorry, Hana. Hana? What's wrong with you? Talha, what's this now? What's wrong with you? Jimmy! Talha! Sasha! You okay? What? What? Oh, man, it's you. I already told you to leave, right? What is it that you don't understand? Are you deaf? Gosh. If you really want to make content, you go somewhere else. Villa Nabila, Highland Towers. You go to those places. I'm talking to you. You hear me? Even if I shoved this flashlight in your mouth, it wouldn't make a difference. You're adorable. Okay, you want to create content here, right? It's fine. Do it. It's fine. Let me be the one to get out of here. You're adorable... Ba! Ba! Sasha! Bariah! Ba! Wake up! Ba! Ba, get up! Alhamdulillah! Aliff, what happened? You fainted, Ba! You fainted! We have to leave! We have to get out of this house now! Fainted? What about the song? Where's Jimmy and Sasha? Sasha, she... I'll tell you later, let's go! I'm just the cameraman. I didn't do anything. Hana, stay calm. Relax, Hana. Hana! Jimmy! It's locked! Talha! Oh, God, Jimmy! Aliff, Ba, help me! Hana, please don't! - Talha! - Talha! Talha. Bariah, do it! Try it, Bariah! It's locked! - Aliff! - Ba! Ba! Aliff, help! - Aliff! - Ba! Aliff! Aliff! Ba! Ba! Ba! Ba! Ba! Ba! Ba, get up! Ba! Ba! Ba! Bariah. Talha. Jimmy, Sasha. I'm sorry, this is my fault. I shouldn't have asked you guys to come here. Isn't it tragic? What you seek is not what you get. This is just one in a thousand things and accidents that could happen daily. No matter what you're doing. Eating fried noodles at your favorite Mamak, spending time with your beloved family, or like these kids, looking for YouTube content at an old house. Not only is it old, but when you go in... When death comes, you cannot run away. So, as the foreigners say, "Prepare your umbrella before it rains," get protection from Bosku Insurance for as low as 50 ringgit a month. And in the event of death or accident, you will receive one million ringgit in compensation. So, what are you waiting for? From a world-famous comedian to an insurance agent. THREE WEEKS BEFORE What's up, channel? Welcome to my guys! Alright, guys, I have a special treat for you. Remember once I made a reaction video about the ghost I said was fake? They are all just acting, right? Good evening. What a lovely weather today. So today, I'm gonna talk about the squeezed chicken. In Malaysia, we call it "ayam penyet." And now, I'm going to try it. Let's see how comfortable these shoes are from one of Malaysia's leading brands. There once was... And herein lies the tale of Sang Kancil. They all came to gather to see the great Sultan Pharaoh. Sultans are not pharaohs. Okay. I'm okay, even though the film poster is not attractive, but I'm fine after I watch the trailer because you can't judge a movie by its poster, you know? You can't just think, "Oh, the poster is like this. Therefore the movie is like this." What's that? Where'd you attend film school? Team Wowzer met a real-life ghost. If you don't believe us, watch the video now. - Team HusbandWife looking for a vampire! - Team HusbandWife looking for a vampire! To be a second wife. Channel SexyDiva. What's that? That! DON'T WATCH IF YOU'RE EASILY SCARED #REALGHOST No! Ba. Is Cyclops okay? - No, Phasa okay. - Phasa? Why are you late? I had something to do. What's going on? Order your drink first. I don't want to. - I'm in a hurry. I'm just here a minute. - What do you want to drink? I don't want any, don't disturb me! Netizen. Aliff, are you okay? - I'm okay. - You look moody. I'm okay. You look tired. Did you get enough sleep? I'm okay. Quickly tell your story, Ba. What is it? Okay. So the story is... Ba, we have to go back to that house. Are you crazy? Of course not. Why, Ba? Why? What's the problem? You don't want to find the meaning behind your dream? Aliff, you must be joking. - Remember what happened to us? - Right. We were lucky not to have gone to jail. I know, I know. But are you willing to let Ba be haunted by her mysterious dream? Who knows, we go, we find the room, and then there's Japanese treasure. - Ba, let's go. - No... I don't care what's in the room. I won't go back there, okay? Why are you so scared? What are you worried about? Relax, okay. We go, we look, and then we come back. Right? So simple. Okay, how about this, guys? I'll pay you. I said no! Sorry. Okay, Aliff, why do you want to go back? Be honest. Just tell us. I... I don't really want to go back to that house. - It's not just a whim, but... - But what? You know I'm a full-time YouTuber. My income is solely from YouTube. Okay, so? Since we made that Ada Hantu video the other day, I've created all sorts of content for my channel. I did reviews. I did this. I did that. All sorts of things. No likes at all. My views are low. There are some with 20 views, 15 of it is from me. But when I see other YouTubers make ghost-hunting content, their videos explode, and their views keep growing. That's why I feel we have to go back to that house so that I can record content there. Because I think this is the kind of content nowadays that can push up my channel Still no. Ba! Ba. Help me, Ba. Have mercy on me. Don't you feel sorry for me, Ba? Ba. Help me, Ba. You're the only one that can help me, Siti Nur Bariah. - People are watching. - Ba, help me. If no one watches my channel, I'd have no income. If I have no income, I won't have any money. If I don't get money, I won't eat, I cannot pay rent, I cannot change screen protectors, Ba. Ba, I have a lot of siblings. There are nine back home, and I pay for their schooling. If they don't go to school, they'll end up being idiots like me. - Ba, help me. - Ba. - Look at him. - Ba, let's go. Please, Ba. Ba. Help me, Ba. Okay. Ba, what did you say? I said okay. Thank you, Ba - Look. - It's so big. Of course. - Is it okay, Aliff? - It's okay. - Nice. - Guys, I'm sorry. This time, I cannot join you guys. Why? I'm a little bit busy. My dad just got a new job. I have to help him. - Your dad... - What does your dad do? Contractor. You know this. Guys, it's okay. It's like this. I won't be here, but use the studio however you like, okay? Make sure your plan is an awesome one. Ciao. - Bye. - Steady. Ciao, bro. Bye. So, Aliff, how goes the plan? Okay, so this project won't be successful with just us five. Ba, you have to call Team B. Yo, how are things, you guys? Guys! Anita. Anita, our gang. He's not single anymore. I didn't hear about you getting a girlfriend. How long? Two years. Wow, so sweet. Aliff! You want the video like the last time? The prank one? More or less. But this time on a bigger scale. And for that, we need cameras and cameramen. Yeah, good! - Are you serious? - I am. This is not a normal project And, guys, I also need a makeup artist. Any recommendations? I can do makeup. For real? She's not only beautiful but can also do makeup. Enough. Why do we need a makeup artist? Because I want the effects to look real and scary. And Ba... you are the mastermind, right? Can you help me plan this prank? Yes. Thirty percent. Wait, Aliff, what's your actual plan? Well, friends, the greatest prank in the world. Thank you to all in attendance for Ada Hantu 2 project. Give yourselves a round of applause. Friends, thank you. As you may already know, Ada Hantu 1 really struck a chord with viewers and became popular and trending. So for Ada Hantu 2, we can no longer play with horror elements that are boring, common, and cliched. This time, we will be toying with the biggest... YB! - Long live YB! - Yeah. Everything is ready. When can we start? Hang on. We can't start yet. One more person isn't here. - Oh, yeah. - Who? Hello, guys. Sorry, I'm late. I woke up early but when I was waiting for the bus, a car splashed a puddle. My clothes are all wet. I dried my clothes. I saw the bus pass. I chased after it. I chased, but I couldn't make it. Hana don't chase, chase later, enough No need to chase, Hana you may sit down. Please. Hello. Who's that? That's Hana. She's an actress, on TV dramas Mondays to Thursdays. - Hi, my name is Hana. - I know. Sorry I was late. There was a car splashing on a puddle, my clothes are all wet. The first thing viewers will look at, is the acting quality. So if you're like a wood, not convincing. They will know that this is fake. So I want you to get immersed in your roles. If you're angry, get angry. If you're sad, be sad. Just feel it, think of it as your ticket to Hollywood. Teacher! Teacher! Over here! Can you show us the type of acting that can take us to Hollywood? Observe. - Mood. - Mood. Ba, where are you going? Like you're going, but then not going. - No, actually I'm... - Enough. Friends, please stand. Turn. - Like this? - Yes. Talha. Girlfriend did not check WhatsApp, but checks Telegram. Huh, feel it. - Sasha. - Yes. Upon reaching Pavilion, discovered you forgot to put on your makeup. Look at that sad face without makeup. Like this, you know. Jimmy. Turn. Scary. - Ba, you know I'm a drama queen. - Queen. I'm on TikTok. School theater, primary school. Come on. I can do it too, but later. For this to work, everything must be perfect. Everyone's role, every department is equally important. Like a Domino effect. One mistake. And this whole thing will fail. Make up and props, without these two our prank will not work. - Aliff. - Who's this? -This is Ali -Ali. Ali. Aliff. Ali does what? He just finished shooting with Jackie Chan. Oh, stuntman? Oh no, not there yet. - Just a -unt. - unt? Props like blood, heads, ax. All of it has to look real. And makeup has to be really scary until the audience cannot sleep at night. So when you see the red light, it means the camera is on. Okay, camera A is on. But sometimes there's a lag. Yes, so you really have to pay attention to the red light. If anything happens and the red light comes on, you have to be in character. Farah, you'll be the director, okay? Which means, Farah will be the one to identify which camera is on. Okay, ready? Okay, cam A live. - Hi. - How you guys doing? Good? Cam B live. Cam C live. Okay, understand? - Understood. - Good. Make sure you take a lot of me from the right angle. Because my jawline is more pronounced on the right side. When the camera is on, you have to tell me. You have to stay focus, you know? - Understood. - Right side. Let's go! Can I see? Keep it, let's not show it to the camera. Suresh, see? What drawing is that? My inner feelings. Abstract art. We are orchestrating a prank, not an art exhibition. Anita? Oh yes! This is the one, okay, good job. I like these kind of things. My dear. I'm so proud of you. I know. - Good job. - I know. Okay Hana, for this scene you have to act like you're possessed and then you chase after Sasha. - Okay? - Okay, actors ready? Get in the mood, take the feel, ready and action! Cut! Okay? How did I do? - It's okay, but... - Aliff. It's not okay, I wasn't scared at all. Aliff, you said Hana is an actress from the 7:00 pm TV drama. - She can't even do this. - Sasha. Half past seven. Relax Sha, maybe she's just nervous. It's okay, we try again. One more time, one more time is good. Standby, actors ready, standby and... What else do you want? Can we turn the camera on? - Camera? - Camera. - Bro, can you turn on the camera? - Yes? Okay. Roll the camera? Okay, roll camera. - Rolling. - Okay, standby and action. Sasha. Cut! Good work! Amazing! - Sasha, it's just acting. - Relax, but amazing! It's just acting, don't be so serious. Sorry. - I'm sorry I scared you just now. - It's okay. Don't come near me, don't come near me. Okay, so now we are looking at camera A. Okay. If we want to look at camera B - you press this, number two. - Number two. Correct, if you want to look at camera C, what do you press? This. So clever! Talha moves fast. This time, you're both in the kitchen. The situation is tense because you need to stay you need to go and look for us. Okay, I want you to make it so tense until you both start fighting, and you slap him. Wait Why do we have to have slapping scenes? It's the drama, viewers like that. You don't understand a simple thing like that? The one who's getting hit is me, not you. Okay, alright. When you're about to slap him, I want you to imagine that he's the most annoying person you've ever met. You can't even see his eyebrows, you're so annoyed. Okay? Action! Supposed to be shooting time. Not now, now you don't have to slap for real. You know? No need to slap, no need. One more time. Suresh, don't aim at me. Aim at the mannequin. Aliff, mannequin, mannequin, Aliff. Understand? You can't even get that. You do it! Peter, you're a sharp shooter Right? Peter, you're the one shooting at Hana. Roger that. Okay, you guys have to listen carefully. This scene we have to do properly, because this is the climax. If we get it wrong, we'll look fake. But if we get it right viewers will believe that it's real. Come here. When you're going closer to Peter and Suresh over here, Hana will kill you, okay, Hana? Drop dead, okay, good. When you have dropped, you have to make sure the camera is on Talha and then you move it to Hana, so we can get her close up. Aliff. Someone is here to see you - We are rehearsing, who? - Over there. Datin Founder. It's you, Datin Founder. Datin. How are you, Sir? Datin, Sir. - Who's that? - I don't know. But Aliff is giving them so much respect. Oh, this is the pan on TV, everybody's looking for it. You know right, we support you. This is the drink that's trending right now. This must be a sponsor. If not, Aliff wouldn't treat them like that. - Right? - Confirmed Aliff, we really love you, you know. Datin, thank you Datin. We can't wait to shoot. You look young, Datin. You must be drinking this frequently. EVENT DAY 5PM Okay guys, we only have two hours before going live. Let's go. - Where do you want to set the tent? - Put it at the back. What's your problem? This is my path, and that is yours. What's wrong? What's wrong? We have two hours to go, what's up? Look! Help! Gosh. - Are the boxes okay? - Okay. - All good? - Okay. Are you okay over there, bro? No need to yell. Let's go, we're late. Okay, friends, as promised... They're here Okay, we will look for the door from Ba's dream. You've all seen the photo, right? Okay, Talha, Jimmy, you look in the piano room. Farah, Anita, the maid's room and also, kitchen. Peter and Suresh check the bedroom. After that, we gather, we look in the backstage room. Can you do it or not? We can. Any questions? Okay, let's move. Where's Sasha? Late as usual. Bro. Are you measuring the floor? I'm looking for the door. Who knows, maybe there's a secret door here. These mystical things, we can't use common sense. Think outside the box. No need, what? - Why am I here? - That's me Not funny - This hallway is so weird, right? - Right. Let's go. Nothing. Why? Doraemon. Idiot! - Found it? - Yes. The toilet door. We've looked twice, Ba, it's not here. It's fine. I've looked through the whole house. I don't think that door exists. Maybe your photo is of another house? Right? Maybe. Maybe I made a mistake. Okay, since everyone is here I think we can get ready. - Let's go. - Set up the door, right? Peter, let's go. My dear, don't be scared. After all this we'll go for a vacation at Bayu Bay Hotel. Oh my God, Bayu Bay. This is the toilet. No dating. The door, close the door! Sorry, teacher. Sorry. Ba, what time is it? Where's Sasha? She's going live for sure. I also got a life! Talha, it's different. - Oh, live. - It's hard to communicate with you. No idea? Still got time to go live. Don't think about it. -You're late -Ba! Still thinking of going live. - Ba, good one. - Anita looks great in pants. -No, she looks great in anything -I know. Ready? Friends, let's gather around for prayers to chase away evil. I've already prayed, and I've chained the house. Oh, you've chained it? That means this house has no more ghosts? Insha'Allah, no more. Could you confirm there are no more ghosts? Insha'Allah, like I said just now. We can only try, Insha'Allah, everyone will be safe. - Thank you so much. - Okay guys. Ten more minutes, so everyone go to your positions now, let's go. Let's go. Ten more minutes. Cameramen, check your batteries? Loaded? Extra batteries, make sure well-stocked in your pockets. Ten seconds to live. Nine. Eight. Before we start, I want to say thank you for doing all this for me. We're doing this for money, not for you. It's okay, the most important thing you're all my forever friends. Okay, let's go. Hands. And three, two, one. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. Action! What's up, channel? Welcome to my guys! It's your boy... Aliff! Who's playing the piano? This time we'll see, guys. Is the ghost pretending to be me, or not. What are you doing here? Hana, I think you should leave. I didn't expect you to be like this. You shame me in front of everyone. Consider yourself lucky we didn't call the police. What's that? Smiling like that, do you think we are spooked? Aliff, that poor girl. You are too harsh with her, Aliff. Oh yes, the kitchen. Come. Did you hear that? Peter. - Where are they? - Still in the kitchen. - Hi Peter. - Hi. - Are you not cold? - Still got time, bro. - Where's the water? - Over there. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. Sea Horse brand is the best. No, I'm curious. Why are all these things here? But seriously if you want kitchen items The Sea Horse brand is really a good choice. What light was that? Maybe lightning? What lightning, we're indoors So what to do now? We don't have time, after this is Hana's scene. Farah come in, Farah come in! Yes Peter, done with the rigging? Yes, but it came off again. What? After this is Hana's scene. Yes I know, we need to buy time to set it up again. Think of something so they stay in the kitchen a little longer, okay? Light, when it is shone on things that are reflective it will bounce or reflect. Okay guys, I bought us some time from Farah. What if we abort mission? What? Mayir. - Mayir? - Mayir. - What does mayir mean? - Hair. - Don't lie. - I didn't. - You were cursing, right? - No. - You think I don't know what that is? - How do you know? I think I know what to do. You know what mayir is? I took Arts Stream. Let's continue. I don't feel too good with all these things. Let's put them back. RIGGING PROBLEM, HOLD IN HERE! Oh, no. Why did you drop the camera? I was in shock, seeing you in shock. You should've focused on my face. I was giving an Oscar-worthy reaction just now. I'm sorry, boss. Remember that. Guys. Guys, I think we have to stay here for now. Done. - Anita, is it settled yet? - Yes, settled. If anybody spots a ghost, we scream... Okay, let's go upstairs. You said we're going to discuss about it.
