Jeff: I'M GOING BY YOU. ( Derek laughing ) TIM. TIM. TIM. TIM! SWITCH. ( Derek grunts ) YEAH! GET IT, GET IT. HERE WE GO. CHECK IT. GOOD SHOT, MAN. COME ON, CHECK IT. HEY, WAKE UP. I GOT IT. UNDERNEATH. UNDERNEATH! Jeff: LOOK OUT! Tim: OH! AWW... YEAH, TWO! I LIKE IT. COME ON, HERBIE, SUCK IT UP. RIGHT HERE, RIGHT HERE. RIGHT HERE. HERE WE GO. YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT. GO AHEAD. SLOWING DOWN FOR AN OLD MAN, HUH? GOING TO THE HOOP. HE'S GOT NOTHING. Tim: STICK HIM, JEFF. STICK HIM. Herbie: REBOUND. I GOT IT. WAY TO GO, JEFF. RIGHT HERE. ( chattering indistinctly ) Herbie: A LITTLE TWO ON TWO TAKES YOUR MIND OFF WORK. Jeff: I'LL BE UP ALL NIGHT THINKING ABOUT MY BACK. WHAT ABOUT OUR BET, HUH? HOW ABOUT PJ'S FOR A COUPLE OF BREWS? Jeff: NOT ME, I'M OUT OF HERE. Derek: COME ON, COUPLE DRINKS TO EASE THE PAIN. WHICH ONE? PAIN OF LIVING, ACE. PAIN OF LIVING. WHAT I NEED TONIGHT IS A BED AND A BATHTUB. I'M GOING HOME. SO, IS ANYBODY COMING WITH ME OR WHAT? I GUESS I'LL TAKE A RAIN CHECK. ME, TOO. HEY, SO WHAT ABOUT LUNCH? ARE YOU BUYING? ARE YOU KIDDING? ( all laughing ) GOOD NIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. ALL RIGHT, TAKE CARE. GOOD NIGHT, HERBIE. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. HEY, I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR BACK. HEY, LIFE'S A BITCH. HOW'S DIANE? ( snorts ) WHAT HAPPENED THIS TIME? OH, I DON'T KNOW. I COULDN'T TALK TO HER. SHE DIDN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BACH AND THE ROLLING STONES. I THOUGHT YOU WERE MORE OF THE JAZZ TYPE. METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING, EINSTEIN. OKAY, THEN WHAT'S THE REAL PROBLEM? Woman: NO... HONESTLY... YEAH. I DON'T KNOW. I'M TIRED OF EVERY DAY BEING A DISAPPOINTMENT. SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED A WEEKEND IN PALM SPRINGS. IT'S GETTING TO BE THAT TIME OF YEAR AGAIN. THANKSGIVING. Woman: STOP TOUCHING ME! LEAVE ME ALONE. ( speaking indistinctly ) I CAN GET US INVITED OVER TO THE BRONSONS' FOR SOME TENNIS. REMEMBER LAST TIME? ( chuckling ) NO, NO, NO. LISTEN TO ME WHEN I TALK TO YOU! DON'T YELL AT ME. THAT'S WHAT I CALL TRUE LOVE. SO WHAT ABOUT PALM SPRINGS? ( man shouting ) ( woman screams ) HEY, GET AWAY FROM HER! STAY OUT OF THIS. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? Man: GET UP, MIRANDA. ( Miranda sobs ) MIRANDA... IT'S TIME TO GO. I DON'T THINK SHE'S GOING ANYWHERE WITH YOU. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO, FRIEND. OH, YOU'RE SCARING US. I THINK YOU'D BETTER BACK OFF. ( Miranda sobs ) WE'RE GOING NOW. HEY, HEY, COME ON. Miranda: NO! YOU'D BETTER THINK OF THE CONSEQUENCES. LEAVE ME ALONE! LOOK, YOU HEARD HER. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE WITH YOU. LET'S GO. ( Miranda screams ) GO BACK! SHIT! A PROPHECY, MY BROTHER. YOU WILL REGRET THIS FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIVE. IT'S ALL RIGHT. HE'S GONE. IT'S OVER. THANK YOU. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH, HE BARELY GOT ME. HERE, PUT THIS ON IT. IT'S OKAY. LISTEN, WHO WAS THAT GUY ANYWAY? YOU HAVE A CAR HERE? YOU HAVE A WAY HOME? NO. UH, I'LL TAKE HER. DO YOU MIND IF I ASK WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT? I'D RATHER NOT THINK ABOUT IT. I'M MIRANDA REED. JEFF MILLS. YOU THINK IT'D BE A GOOD IDEA IF YOU TOLD ME WHERE YOU LIVE? YOU DO WANT TO GO HOME, DON'T YOU? I DON'T HAVE A HOME. NOT ANYMORE. I'VE BEEN LIVING WITH ALDYS. YOU MEAN THAT GUY IN THE PARKING LOT? HE'S NOT ALWAYS THAT BAD. SOMETIMES HE'S WORSE. ( chuckles ) I CAN IMAGINE. IF YOU COULD JUST TAKE ME TO A MOTEL... LOOK, IT'S BEEN QUITE A NIGHT. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO BE ALONE? I MEAN, YOU'RE WELCOME TO STAY AT MY PLACE IF YOU WANT TO. Jeff: REALLY, SERIOUSLY, I'LL SLEEP ON THE COUCH. ( door opening ) HEY, PAL. HOW ARE YOU? THIS IS GOLIATH. HI, GOLIATH. THAT'S DAVEY. OH, I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS MESS. ( cat purrs ) THEY'RE MAD AT YOU FOR COMING HOME SO LATE. THEY ARE? IT'S IN THEIR EYES. YOU COULD SEE IT, TOO, IF YOU KNEW WHAT TO LOOK FOR. ( soft music playing ) TOM SCOTT? YEAH. CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING? ORANGE JUICE, BEER, SOMETHING TO EAT? ICE CREAM? NO, THANKS. IS THAT A PALANZA? YEAH. DO YOU LIKE IT? IT'S INTERESTING. OH, AND A DONNELLY. OH, I'VE HAD THAT FOR AGES. IT'S THE FIRST PIECE OF ART I EVER BOUGHT. WHAT DO I KNOW? HERE. HOW DO YOU KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT L. A. ARTISTS? I GREW UP HERE, AND I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO PAINT. IS THAT WHAT YOU DO? WELL, I'M TRYING. ACTUALLY, I HAD A COUPLE OF PAINTINGS IN THE LAST VENICE ART WALK. REALLY? I'M IMPRESSED. YOU'RE ALONE. NO BROTHERS, NO SISTERS, YOUR PARENTS ARE GONE NOW. AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. YOU HAVE A SCAR. THEY WERE KILLED SIX YEARS AGO. YOU DO SOMETHING WITH THE LAW. POLICEMAN? NO. A LAWYER. YOU'VE NEVER BEEN IN LOVE. YOU'RE NOT SURE YOU EVER WILL BE. HOW DO YOU DO THAT? IT'S A GIFT. SOME PEOPLE, I CAN JUST TELL THINGS. MIRANDA... SHH. I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU DID FOR ME TONIGHT. YOU ALREADY THANKED ME. NO, I HAVEN'T. YOU'RE IN A LOT OF PAIN. AH, WELL, USUALLY A HOT BATH... I CAN HEAL YOU. LIE DOWN. TURN OVER. I FEEL BETTER ALREADY. SHH. ( chanting softly ) ( grunts ) OH, GOD, THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. THE PAIN IS COMPLETELY GONE. ( birds chirping ) DAVEY? GOLIATH? ( whistling ) ( scratching sounds ) ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH. ( radio playing ) DON'T. I LIKE THAT SONG. ( pop music playing ) YOU KNOW, YOU'RE WELCOME TO STAY HERE TODAY. IF YOU WANT. I'VE GOT A LOT OF OLD MOVIES ON TAPE. SOME GREAT BOOKS, MUSIC... ( dog barking ) Jeff: SO THEN, SHE TAKES BOTH HANDS AND SHE PRESSES THEM INTO THIS SPOT ON MY LOWER BACK. I FEEL THIS INTENSE BURNING SENSATION FOR ABOUT A SECOND, THEN I WAS FINE. SO YOUR BACK WAS ACTUALLY HEALED? COMPLETELY. THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. HEY, TIM, YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD THIS PAIN LATELY, RIGHT HERE. YEAH, RIGHT, SURE. RIGHT HERE. THIS CASE IS KILLING ME. WHAT DID I MISS, GUYS? THE DETAILS OF JEFF'S LATEST CONQUEST. YEAH, SO WHAT HAPPENED? YOU DID SLEEP WITH HER AFTER ALL THAT, DIDN'T YOU? HUH? WELL... COME ON. YEAH. THAT'S MY BOY. WHAT HAPPENED? THAT'S ALL WE DID. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THAT'S ALL YOU DID? JEFF, NO. I DON'T... WHERE IS SHE NOW? SHE WAS SLEEPING WHEN I LEFT. SHE... OH, JEFF... Herbie: WAIT A MINUTE. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU LEFT THIS CHICK ALONE IN YOUR HOUSE? SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR STEREO AND TV, PAL. ( laughing ) COME ON, HERBIE, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. LOOK, I GOTTA RUN. BUT I WISH I COULD SEE THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE WHEN YOU GET HOME TONIGHT. SEE YA. SEE YA LATER, GUYS. Derek: SO LONG, HERBIE. DON'T LISTEN TO HIM. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. ( soft music playing ) WELCOME HOME. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO CLEAN THE... I WANTED TO. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU'D STILL BE HERE WHEN I GOT HOME. ARE YOU KIDDING? I COULDN'T LEAVE WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE. ( music playing ) YOU HAD SIX MONTHS OF SPORTS PAGES STACKED IN YOUR LIVING ROOM. IMPOSSIBLE. THEY'RE STILL IN THE TRASH. GO SEE FOR YOURSELF. ( screams ) TO YOU. SO WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW? I HAVE TO GET MY LIFE STRAIGHTENED OUT. I'VE GOT AN OLD FRIEND IN VENICE, AND I'M SURE HE WON'T MIND PUTTING ME UP FOR A FEW WEEKS. HE? UH-HUH. HAVE YOU CALLED HIM YET? NO, I THOUGHT I'D DO IT IN THE MORNING, IF THAT'S OKAY. LISTEN, I DON'T WANT TO IMPOSE. I CAN LEAVE TONIGHT RIGHT AFTER DINNER. I DON'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE. I WANT YOU TO STAY HERE WITH ME. I DON'T KNOW. NO COMMITMENTS, NO PROMISES, ANYTIME YOU HATE IT, YOU CAN LEAVE. WHAT IF ALDYS COMES LOOKING FOR ME? ( exhales ) WELL, I HAVE TO ADMIT, THIS ALDYS GUY IS A FAIRLY STRANGE INDIVIDUAL, BUT HE'S JUST ONE GUY. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO. NOW YOU SOUND EXACTLY LIKE HIM. DON'T SAY THAT. DON'T EVER SAY THAT. ( water dripping ) I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY, OKAY? BUT THE GUY DOESN'T KNOW WHERE I LIVE OR WHO I AM. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THE MAN'S HISTORY. LOOK, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IF THIS ALDYS CHARACTER SHOWS UP, I'LL KICK THE SHIT OUT OF HIM. WHAT DO YOU SAY? WAS THAT A YES? I THINK SO. ARE YOU SURE? YES. Florist: THESE ARE VERY NICE TOGETHER. THERE YOU GO. THANKS. ( engine starting ) ( keys jangling ) Aldys: HE NEVER COULD HAVE HELPED YOU. NO ONE EVER LEAVES US. ( screaming ) HEY, I CAN'T THANK YOU GUYS ENOUGH. THAT WAS THE GREATEST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME. YOU'RE WELCOME, BROCK. YOU GOTTA PROMISE TO BE MORE CAREFUL FROM NOW ON. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MORE TIMES WE CAN GET YOU OFF ON TECHNICALITIES. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? YOU GUYS ARE INVINCIBLE. YEAH, RIGHT. WELL, THE NEXT TIME YOU GET A DELIVERY FROM UPS, DON'T ASSUME THE DRIVER'S A TERRORIST. YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL. THEY'RE EVERYWHERE. BROCK. OKAY, OKAY. YOU JUST REMEMBER WHEN THE ATTACK COMES, MY HOUSE HAS STEEL REINFORCED WALLS, BARBED WIRE PERIMETERS AND HEAT-SEEKING INTRUDER SENSORS. SO? YOU GUYS ARE WELCOME TO HANG WITH ME. THAT'S TERRIFIC, BROCK. YEAH. IN THE MEANTIME, CHILL OUT, OKAY? FUCKIN'-A! HA HA! YOU WERE UNBELIEVABLE. Jeff: YOU SEE THE LOOK ON THE D. A.'S FACE WHEN I REQUESTED A MISTRIAL? DEMANDED IS MORE LIKE IT. THIS CALLS FOR A CELEBRATION. YOU'RE RIGHT. SATURDAY NIGHT AT MY PLACE. MIRANDA IS DYING TO MEET EVERYONE ANYWAY. THIS'LL BE PERFECT. WAIT A MINUTE, THE LAST TIME WE HAD A PARTY AT YOUR PLACE, WE ALL STAYED FOR BREAKFAST. DO YOU THINK MIRANDA'S READY FOR THAT? THAT WAS HERBIE'S BACHELOR PARTY. YES. YES. I HAVE THE FEELING THIS WILL BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CIVILIZED. ( music playing ) ( chuckles ) SHE IS WONDERFUL, JEFF. SHE'S GORGEOUS, TOO. YOU REALLY LUCKED OUT. THINK SHE'S GONNA STEAL MY TV? HUH? HI. EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND. GRACE... YOU MADE IT. I HATE THESE STREETS. THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE. BUT I'M HERE. SO WHERE IS SHE? JUST ONE SECOND. MIRANDA? COME HERE, THERE'S SOMEONE I WANT YOU TO MEET. EXCUSE ME, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. JEFF, SHE'S GORGEOUS. JUST WAIT TILL YOU MEET HER. MIRANDA, THIS IS GRACE WOODS, MY SECRETARY, THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT WOMAN IN MY LIFE. GRACE, THIS IS MIRANDA REED. I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOU. I'M GLAD YOU COULD COME. IT'S A PLEASURE. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME... HAVING A GOOD TIME? TERRIFIC. NOW WHAT CAN I GET YOU? OH, JUST A DIET PEPSI. HI... CAN'T BELIEVE THE MAN'S GOT EVERY SINGLE MOVIE CAPRA EVER MADE. HELLO, DEREK. HOW YOU DOING, HOT STUFF? HOW'S THE NEWS BUSINESS? VIOLENT, AS USUAL. LET'S GET SOMETHING TO EAT. FELICIA, WHY DON'T YOU PUT A MUZZLE ON HIM? Miranda: GIVE ME YOUR HAND. LIKE THIS. DID YOU KNOW THE PALM IS A MIRROR TO THE SOUL? RELAX. YOU LOVE TO EAT, BUT YOU NEVER GAIN WEIGHT. TRUE. YOU'RE HAPPILY MARRIED. WELL... ( chuckling ) HERE YOU GO, BUDDY. CHEERS. FELICIA'S LOOKING GREAT TONIGHT. YEAH. ( indistinct conversations ) YOU'RE A LUCKY BASTARD. I KNEW I SHOULD'VE DRIVEN HER HOME. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, EAT YOUR HEART OUT. Grace: YOU TWO, GO AHEAD. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. ( Miranda laughing ) Miranda: WAIT, WAIT. THERE'S MORE. YOU'RE GONNA LOSE SOMETHING. YEAH, THE FOOTBALL POOL. SOMETHING IMPORTANT ON THE NEXT SOLSTICE. WHEN'S THAT? IN DECEMBER. IT'S THE LONGEST NIGHT OF THE YEAR. MORE THAN 12 HOURS OF DARKNESS. IT'S A VERY HOLY NIGHT. ( chuckling ) WELL, THAT'S IT. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'VE GOTTA CHECK ON THE TURKEY. WAIT A MINUTE... WHY DOESN'T SHE READ MY HAND? Woman: THAT WAS INTERESTING. ( chuckles ) ( indistinct chatter ) ( murmuring ) GREAT PARTY. THANK YOU. I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING JEFF'S FRIENDS. THOSE THINGS YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT THE SOLSTICE WERE FASCINATING. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE LISTENING. I COULDN'T HELP OVERHEARING. I WAS CURIOUS... YOU SAID IT WAS A HOLY NIGHT. WHAT RELIGION WERE YOU REFERRING TO? NONE IN PARTICULAR. ACTUALLY, I THROW THAT IN WHENEVER I READ PALMS. PEOPLE ARE SO INTRIGUED BY THE OCCULT. MAKES ME SOUND, I DON'T KNOW, MORE AUTHENTIC. IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE. THANK YOU. NEED ANY HELP? NO, I THINK I'VE GOT IT. WHERE ARE YOU FROM? HERE, L. A. OH, A NATIVE. HOW UNUSUAL. IS REED YOUR FAMILY NAME? YES, IT IS. YOU KNOW, JEFF HAS TOLD ME SO MUCH ABOUT YOU. BUT I CAN'T RECALL HIM TELLING ME EXACTLY HOW THE TWO OF YOU MET. WE MET THROUGH A FRIEND... ONE NIGHT AFTER JEFF HAD BEEN PLAYING BASKETBALL. OH, AT PJ'S? YES, IT WAS PJ'S. FUNNY HOW THINGS WORKED OUT BETWEEN YOU AND JEFF. THE WAY YOU MET. THE WAY YOU MOVED RIGHT IN. JEFF ASKED ME TO MOVE IN. OH, OF COURSE HE DID. OF COURSE. WHY DON'T YOU JUST SPIT IT OUT? EXCUSE ME? WHAT DO YOU WANT? I WAS ABOUT TO ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION. I THOUGHT YOU COULD USE SOME HELP. THANKS. DON'T BURN YOURSELF. "...SO WHAT'S THE MATTER," AND HE GOES, "I DON'T REMEMBER WHERE I LIVE." ( all laughing ) LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FRIENDS... NO, THIS IS SERIOUS. UH-OH. I'D LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST TO MIRANDA FOR MAKING SUCH A DELICIOUS MEAL. Man: OH, YEAH! ABSOLUTELY. AND PUTTING UP SO WELL WITH JEFF. ( all laugh ) THANK YOU AND WELCOME. CHEERS! All: CHEERS! I'D LIKE TO MAKE A TOAST TO JEFF FOR HAVING SUCH GOOD TASTE. YES, YES. I HAVEN'T KNOWN HIM AS LONG AS MOST OF YOU, BUT I'M WILLING TO BET HE'S NEVER BEEN QUITE SO HAPPY. CONGRATULATIONS, ACE. YOU DESERVE IT. All: CHEERS! ( indistinct chatter ) THAT'S THE WORST OF IT. LET'S LEAVE THE REST UNTIL MORNING. GREAT. YOU WERE TERRIFIC. EVERYONE LOVED YOU. ( phone rings ) HELLO? ( garbled sounds ) HELLO? WHO WAS IT? I DON'T KNOW. THERE WAS NOBODY THERE. COME ON, LET'S GO TO BED. SO? WHAT'D YOU THINK? IT WAS A WONDERFUL PARTY, JEFF. EVERYONE HAD A GREAT TIME. NO, NOT ABOUT THE PARTY, ABOUT MIRANDA. I TOLD YOU. I THINK SHE'S VERY NICE. COME ON. LOOK, I THINK SHE IS A FINE GIRL. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TODAY, SO WHY DON'T WE JUST GET STARTED? YOU DIDN'T LIKE HER. IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS. BUT YOU HAVE GREAT INSTINCTS. NO, I DON'T. GRACE... ALL RIGHT. I DON'T LIKE HER. I THINK SHE'S REALLY... WEIRD. SHE LIED TO ME. ABOUT WHAT? SHE SAID THE TWO OF YOU MET AT PJ'S. IS THAT TRUE? NO, WE MET IN A PARKING LOT. HER BOYFRIEND WAS BEATING HER UP. SHE PROBABLY LIED BECAUSE SHE WAS TOO EMBARRASSED TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. GRACE, SHE WANTS YOU TO LIKE HER. YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. SHE TOOK THE TURKEY OUT OF THE OVEN WITH HER BARE HANDS, AND SHE DIDN'T GET BURNED. OH, COME ON. I SAW HER. GRACE, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. THAT WOMAN'S TROUBLE, JEFF. OKAY, I'LL TAKE IT UNDER ADVISEMENT. BUT GRACE, I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, MIRANDA'S PART OF MY LIFE NOW. I REALLY WANT YOU TWO TO GET ALONG. YOU GOT IT. ( mumbles ) EXCUSE ME? I SAID, "LOVE REALLY IS BLIND." ( door closes ) THAT WAS SOME PARTY SATURDAY NIGHT, WASN'T IT? THAT IT WAS. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WOMAN? GIRL COULD BE A MOVIE STAR. HOW LUCKY CAN YOU GET? HE DESERVES IT. COME ON. I HEAR GRACE DOESN'T LIKE HER. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT GRACE NEEDS. HOLD THAT ELEVATOR. ( indistinct chatter ) HI, CAN I HELP YOU? I'M HERE TO SEE MR. MILLS. HE'S EXPECTING ME. OH, HIS SECRETARY HAS GONE HOME FOR THE DAY, BUT I'LL SEE IF HE'S STILL HERE. HI, JEFF, THERE'S A WOMAN HERE WHO SAYS YOU'VE BEEN EXPECTING HER. I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS YOUR NAME? MRS. WHITE. A MRS. WHITE. ALL RIGHT. YOU CAN GO RIGHT IN. IT'S THE FIFTH DOOR TO YOUR RIGHT. THANK YOU. MMM-HMM. I KNOW, YEAH I KNOW. HOLD ON A SECOND. PLEASE COME IN. HAVE A SEAT. I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU. LISTEN, SAM, IT'S GETTING LATE. WHY DON'T WE MEET ON THIS IN THE MORNING, OKAY? SAY ABOUT... 9:45? NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY. HOW ABOUT 3:30 THEN? OKAY, GOOD, I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. GREAT. THANKS. BYE. MRS. WHITE. I'M SORRY, I'M AFRAID I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT THIS WAS ABOUT. WHEN DID YOU MAKE YOUR APPOINTMENT? I MADE NO APPOINTMENT. THE SECRETARY SAID THAT I WAS EXPECTING YOU. WEREN'T YOU? WE DON'T SEEM TO BE GETTING VERY FAR. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? WE WANT HER BACK. EXCUSE ME? YOU HAVE HER. WE WANT HER BACK. YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. IS THIS SOME KIND OF A JOKE? TAKE THIS AS A WARNING. THERE WON'T BE ANOTHER. Miranda: HELLO? HI, IT'S ME. SOMETHING'S WRONG. NO, NOTHING'S... IT'S JUST... DO YOU KNOW A MRS. WHITE? MIRANDA? THEY FOUND US. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "THEY"? I HAVE TO GO. ( dialing ) ( brakes screeching ) ( keys rattling ) ( jangling ) ( strange noise ) IT'S PLAY TIME. MIRANDA? ( beeps ) Mrs. White: WE WARNED YOU, MR. MILLS. ( beeps ) Man: YOU SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO US, MR. MILLS. ( beeps ) ( strange noises ) ( strange noises stop ) Man: HELLO? HELLO, IS MIRANDA THERE? THERE'S NOBODY HERE BY THAT NAME. MAY I HELP YOU? I'M SORRY, I MUST HAVE THE WRONG NUMBER. ( indistinct chatter ) EXCUSE ME. HI, I'M A FRIEND OF DETECTIVE BERGEN'S. IS HE IN? NOT NOW. CAN I HELP YOU? CHRIST, HE SAID HE'D BE HERE. UH, LOOK, MAYBE YOU CAN DO ME A FAVOR. MY GIRLFRIEND DISAPPEARED THREE DAYS AGO. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND HER. FILL ONE OF THESE OUT. WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. NO, I'M NOT HERE TO REPORT A MISSING PERSON. BUT YOU SAID YOUR GIRL... SHE LEFT. VOLUNTARILY. LOOK, I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF ANYONE'S SEEN HER. HERE'S A PICTURE OF HER. JUST PUT THIS UP IN THE SQUAD ROOM FOR ME, OKAY? IT'S GOT MY NAME AND NUMBER WRITTEN ON THE BACK. YOU THINK THIS IS ALL WE GOTTA DO WITH OUR TIME AROUND HERE? TRACK DOWN MISSING GIRLFRIENDS? I THINK YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM, MR. MILLS. MR. MILLS. SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING. LIEUTENANT LEE. HOW DO YOU DO? NOW, WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT? WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME? THE SECOND I SHOW MY GIRLFRIEND'S PICTURE TO THE DESK SERGEANT, HE'S SURE YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO TALK TO ME. DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS? NO. I'VE NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE. THEN WHAT AM I DOING HERE? YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S WEARING A VERY UNUSUAL NECKLACE. SO? DID YOU EVER ASK HER WHERE SHE GOT IT? I DON'T KNOW. HER MOTHER GAVE IT TO HER. SHE SAID IT'S A FAMILY HEIRLOOM OR SOMETHING. OR WHAT IT MEANT? NO. MR. MILLS... YOUR GIRLFRIEND SEEMS TO BE INVOLVED WITH SOME EXTREMELY DANGEROUS PEOPLE. THEY PRACTICE SATANIC WORSHIP. NO OFFENSE, LIEUTENANT, BUT THAT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING I'VE EVER HEARD. MIRANDA IS NO MORE A DEVIL WORSHIPPER THAN I AM. THIS GOES BEYOND DEVIL WORSHIP. WE THINK THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR A NUMBER OF UNSOLVED MURDERS AND DISAPPEARANCES IN L. A. COUNTY. MIRANDA WOULD NEVER BE INVOLVED WITH ANYONE LIKE THAT. HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER SHE IS OR NOT. BUT SHE IS WEARING THEIR SYMBOL. IT'S JUST A PIECE OF JEWELRY. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. WHO IS HE? WHO KNOWS. Lee: WAS THAT THE LAST TIME YOU TALKED TO HER? Jeff: YEAH. WHY WOULD THEY DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT? POWER, SEX, MONEY, WHO KNOWS? THEY'VE GOT A RITUAL FOR EVERYTHING. THE MORE IMPRESSIVE THE SACRIFICE, THE GREATER THE MAGIC. DO YOU BELIEVE IN THAT STUFF? I ONLY BELIEVE WHAT I SAW IN THAT DRAWER. Man: EXCUSE ME, LIEUTENANT? CAPTAIN'S LOOKING FOR YOU. THANKS, MAX. I GOTTA GO. WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN ON THIS END. I PROMISE. IF SHE SHOWS UP ON YOUR END, CALL ME. I WILL. THANKS. LIEUTENANT... WHAT DOES THAT SYMBOL MEAN? DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE READING. THERE'S A BOOKSTORE IN HOLLYWOOD. DRAW YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS. ( strange noises ) ( strange noises ) ( indistinct chanting ) Man: ( distorted ) GET OUT... ( indistinct chatter ) Derek: I DON'T KNOW. WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE TO GET WOULD BE A NOBLE. FIRS ARE NICE, BUT THEY'RE A LITTLE TOO BUSHY FOR ME. THEN LET'S GET A NOBLE. I WANT SOMETHING LIKE THIS HEIGHT, NINE FEET. THAT'D WORK. WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU LIKE THIS? IT'S ALL RIGHT. I MEAN, I COULD GET SOME EXTRA BRANCHES, MAYBE TRIM IT UP. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S ALL IN THE ORNAMENTS, IF YOU ASK ME. HEY, YOU WANNA LIGHTEN UP, HUH? IT'S CHRISTMAS TIME. COME ON. LET'S GET A TREE. LIEUTENANT. MR. MILLS. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE. WE JUST GOT THESE IN. I WAS HOPING YOU COULD RECOGNIZE A FACE OR TWO. Jeff: I KNOW HER. Lee: WHO IS SHE? SHE CALLED HERSELF "MRS. WHITE." SHE PAID ME A VISIT RIGHT BEFORE MIRANDA LEFT. WHAT'D SHE WANT? SHE SAID... THAT THEY WANTED HER BACK. GOOD NIGHT, GRACE. GOOD NIGHT. ROUGH DAY? YEAH. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS ELI KID IS ACTUALLY INNOCENT. GREAT. NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PROVE IT. RIGHT. TOMORROW. IF THERE WAS ANYTHING I COULD DO, ANY WAY TO BRING HER BACK, YOU KNOW I WOULD. I KNOW. YOU WANNA GET SOME DINNER? I GOT A LEAD ON A HOT NEW RESTAURANT. NO, THANKS, I THINK I'M JUST GONNA SIT FOR A WHILE. BUT THANKS FOR STOPPING IN. HEY, IF I DON'T LOOK OUT FOR YOU, ACE, WHO WILL? ( phone rings ) HELLO? Miranda: JEFF, IT'S MIRANDA. I'M IN TROUBLE. PLEASE, YOU'VE GOTTA HELP ME. MIRANDA? MIRANDA? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? COME ON. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? I'LL EXPLAIN LATER. LET'S GO. RIGHT NOW! WHY THE HELL DID YOU LEAVE? I WAS SCARED THEY'D FOUND US. JEFF, WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE! NOT TILL YOU TELL ME ABOUT THIS. IT ISN'T WHAT YOU THINK. I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING, BUT NOT HERE. YOU PUT ME OFF TOO MANY TIMES! FINE, I GOTTA GO. LEAVE IT. GET IN THE CAR. I'M LISTENING. DO YOU KNOW WHAT A COVEN IS? SURE, IT'S A GROUP OF WITCHES. WELL, MY MOTHER IS A WITCH. GO ON. MOST WITCHES ARE POSITIVE. THEY PRACTICE HERBAL MEDICINE AND USE THEIR POWERS TO HEAL. BUT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO MISUSE THOSE POWERS. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE AFTER ME. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. I KNOW. WHEN I WAS TEN, MY FATHER DIED. MY MOTHER CHANGED. WE MOVED INTO A NEW HOUSE. SHE MADE STRANGE NEW FRIENDS. GRADUALLY, THEY TOOK OVER OUR LIVES, OUR MONEY, OUR PROPERTY, EVERYTHING WENT TO THE COVEN. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. TURN UP HERE. AND THEY TAUGHT ME THINGS, HOW TO READ THOUGHTS, HOW TO CAST SPELLS, HOW TO CURE. WHEN I WAS 18, THEY ALLOWED ME TO PARTICIPATE IN SOME OF THEIR CEREMONIES. AT FIRST, I THOUGHT IT WAS EXCITING. I DIDN'T KNOW THEY SACRIFICED ANIMALS. Miranda: PULL OVER. SEE THAT HOUSE? MY MOTHER USED TO TAKE ME THERE. IT'S A MEETING PLACE. THAT HOUSE? IT LOOKS SO-- NORMAL? I'VE SEEN BLOOD RUNNING DOWN ITS WALLS. BUT THE WORST THINGS HAPPEN AT A BEACH, JUST NORTH OF THE VENTURA COUNTY LINE. THE ELDERS OF THE COVEN MEET THERE, EVERY YEAR ON THE NIGHT OF THE WINTER SOLSTICE. ISN'T THAT TOMORROW? I'M SUPPOSED TO ATTEND THAT CEREMONY THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME. WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG? I'VE HEARD THEM TALKING. THERE'S A SACRIFICE AND THE VICTIM MUST COME OF ITS OWN FREE WILL. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS AN ANIMAL, YOU KNOW, LIKE ALL THE OTHERS? BUT IT'S NOT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT'S A PERSON. THEY CUT OUT THEIR HEART. MIRANDA, WE HAVE GOT TO GO TO THE POLICE. I CAN'T. BESIDES, THE POLICE WOULD NEVER BELIEVE ME. YES, THEY WILL. I KNOW SOMEONE THERE. IT DOESN'T MATTER. THESE PEOPLE WILL NEVER REST UNTIL THEY GET EVEN WITH US. I DON'T WANT TO LIVE MY LIFE LIKE THAT. WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE? IF I CAN JUST ELUDE THEM UNTIL AFTER THE SOLSTICE, I'LL BE FREE. WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD THAT MAKE? THEY BELIEVE THAT ANYONE WHO BREAKS RANKS WITH THEM AND ISN'T BACK IN THE FOLD ON THE HOLY NIGHT HAS BROKEN THE CIRCLE FOREVER. I'D BE SAFE. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE TRYING SO HARD TO GET ME NOW. THEY'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. THE HELL WITH THEM! WE'VE GOT, WHAT, 24 HOURS? WE'LL HIDE OUT SOMEWHERE. THEY'LL NEVER FIND US. JEFF, I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THIS. DON'T BE RIDICULOUS. CHECK INTO A HOTEL FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS, YOU'LL HIDE OUT, I'LL TRY MY CASE, AND WE'LL BE HOME IN TIME TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS. NOW LET'S HAUL ASS. THE SOONER WE'RE OUT OF HERE, THE BETTER. ( dog growls ) WHAT'S WRONG, BOY? THERE'S SOMEONE OUTSIDE. STAY HERE. JEFF, DON'T GO OUT THERE! ( dog barks ) GOLIATH! ( dog barks ) HEY, GOLIATH! THERE'S NOBODY OUT THERE. HE MUST HAVE GONE AFTER AN ANIMAL OR SOMETHING. BUT, JEFF... DON'T WORRY. GOLIATH'S RUN OFF BEFORE. HE'LL BE BACK. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S EVERYTHING. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. ( distant sounds ) THERE'S SOMEONE ON THE ROOF. THEY FOUND US. CALL THE POLICE. THEY'VE CUT THE LINE! WHAT? ( glass breaking ) THERE WAS A FACE AT THE WINDOW. ( strange noises ) ( echoing laughter ) Ghost: MIRANDA... ( laughter continues ) ( screams ) ( Miranda screams ) GET BACK TO THE BEDROOM. GO! THERE ARE ABOUT TEN OF THEM AT THE BEDROOM WINDOW. JUST STARING AT ME. ( Miranda screams ) ( chanting ) WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? IT'S JUST A PROTECTION SPELL. IT WON'T LAST LONG AND THEY KNOW IT. I'M NOT THAT STRONG. Jeff: COME ON, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE! Miranda: WE CAN'T GO ANYWHERE. THEY'RE RIGHT OUTSIDE. IT'S SAFER TO STAY INSIDE THE CIRCLE. INSIDE THE CIRCLE? JEFF, PLEASE, YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE ME. ( chanting ) THERE, THAT SHOULD KEEP US SAFE THROUGH THE NIGHT, ANYWAY. WHAT IF THEY COME BACK? ARE YOU SURE THIS WILL WORK? THEY WON'T ENTER IT AS LONG AS WE BOTH BELIEVE IN IT. I SURE HOPE THEY DO. ( dog barking ) ( answering machine clicks ) ( strange noises ) ( strange noises stop ) ( dog barking ) LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. ( dog barks ) ( knocking ) MIRANDA. CAN WE COME IN? YEAH, SURE, COME ON IN. ( inaudible ) IF I HADN'T SEEN ALDYS THAT NIGHT, I WOULDN'T BUY ANY OF THIS. BUT YOU DID SEE HIM. I'M WITH YOU ON THIS. JUST, HOW DO YOU WANT TO HANDLE IT? I DON'T KNOW. WE'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF TOWN FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. YOU MEAN MIRANDA HAS TO GET OUT OF TOWN. I'M GOING WITH HER. WHAT ABOUT THE ELI KID? DON'T YOU HAVE A COURT DATE TODAY? WAIT A MINUTE, ACE. YOU'VE BEEN PREPPING THAT FOR TWO MONTHS. YOU JUST DON'T WALK AWAY FROM IT. NOW I LOVE WOMEN AS MUCH AS THE NEXT GUY, BUT... DON'T THROW YOUR CAREER AWAY FOR ONE. IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO. ( gate buzzing ) Brock: WITCHES? HA HA HA HA! WITCHES! THAT'S THE CRAZIEST DAMN THING I EVER HEARD OF. JUST TRUST ME ON THIS, OKAY? TRUST ME. BRING 'EM ON. I'LL TEACH THOSE WEIRD-ASSES SOMETHING NEW. BETTER YET, LET'S GO GET THEM, HUH? BROCK-- WE HAVE TO GO TO THE OFFICE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING. YOU SURE YOU'LL BE OKAY? I'M FINE. I DON'T THINK ANYTHING COULD GET THROUGH THESE WALLS. ( radio transmission ) HURRY BACK. I'LL BE BACK AROUND 5:00. BY 6:00, WE'LL BE ON A PLANE, THIS NIGHTMARE WILL BE OVER. LET'S HIT IT. THANKS, BROCK. ( intercom buzzes ) YEAH. Grace: MR. KENNERLE WILL BE READY TO GO IN TEN MINUTES. GOOD, THANKS. AND THERE'S A MRS. WHITE HERE TO SEE YOU. ALL RIGHT, SEND HER IN. ANOTHER WARNING, MRS. WHITE? YOU'VE HAD YOUR WARNING. MAYBE YOU CAME BY TO CONGRATULATE ME ON LAST NIGHT'S VICTORY. I BELIEVE YOU'RE STILL HOLDING SOMETHING OF OURS. MIRANDA IS NOT YOURS. OH, BUT SHE IS. SHE ALWAYS WILL BE. YOU CAN'T WIN, MR. MILLS. WE'RE ALL AROUND YOU. YOU CAN'T EVEN TAKE A PISS WITHOUT US KNOWING ABOUT IT. ALL RIGHT, I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. GET OUT OF MY OFFICE! GET OUT RIGHT NOW. I'LL CALL THE POLICE! OH, PLEASE DO. I'M SURE MIRANDA WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR SENDING HER MOTHER TO PRISON. OH, MY GOD. ( laughs ) WE HAVE FRIENDS EVERYWHERE. EVEN IN OHIO. EVEN IN SENECA COUNTY. WE DUG YOUR MOTHER UP A FEW NIGHTS AGO. I'VE USED THE BONES MYSELF. GET OUT! GET OUT! ( cackles ) ( screaming ) Jeff: GET OUT! GET OUT OF MY OFFICE! ( screaming ) GRACE, CALL SECURITY. JEFF... SHUT UP! SOMEBODY HELP ME! YOU GET AWAY! SHUT UP! DAMN YOU! WHAT'S HAPPENING? ( screams ) DON'T YOU EVER COME HERE AGAIN! DO YOU HEAR ME? AND YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY HOUSE! DO YOU UNDERSTAND? MIRANDA IS NEVER COMING BACK TO YOU! NEVER! DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? DON'T FALL FOR THAT! I NEVER TOUCHED HER! DON'T LET HIM HIT ME!

Priest: AT THIS TIME OF GRIEF, WE MUST REMEMBER THE SOUL OF THE ONE WE LOVED SO DEARLY IS NOW RESTING IN A FAR BETTER PLACE. "THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD. "I SHALL NOT WANT. "HE MAKETH ME TO LIE DOWN IN GREEN PASTURES, "HE LEADETH ME BESIDE THE STILL WATERS. "HE RESTORETH MY SOUL. "HE LEADETH ME IN THE PATHS OF RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE." EXCUSE ME. DEREK CLAYTON? LIEUTENANT LEE. MIND IF I ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS? WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, LIEUTENANT? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW JEFF MILLS? COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS. AND YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM SINCE? NOPE. SAID HE WAS TIRED OF THE RAT RACE. HE WAS GONNA DROP OUT SOMEWHERE IN MEXICO WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND MIRANDA. WERE YOU, UH, A FRIEND OF THE DECEASED? NO. GRACE RECENTLY CONTACTED ME ABOUT JEFF'S DISAPPEARANCE. HER ACCIDENT OCCURRED ON THE WAY TO MY OFFICE. I TOLD GRACE RIGHT BEFORE SHE DIED THAT JEFF HAD GONE TO MEXICO. I GUESS SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE ME. APPARENTLY NOT. BETWEEN YOU AND ME, LIEUTENANT, GRACE WAS A PRETTY HEAVY DRINKER. I UNDERSTAND SHE WAS QUITE DRUNK THE NIGHT OF HER ACCIDENT. AM I CORRECT? THEY DID FIND ALCOHOL IN HER BLOOD, YES. WELL... JEFF'S GONNA BE HEARTBROKEN WHEN HE FINDS OUT. COULD BE DIFFICULT IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO CONTACT HIM. DON'T WORRY, LIEUTENANT, HE'LL COME HOME SOONER OR LATER. NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE OFFICE. Phil: I KNOW IN SIX MONTHS, THIS ENGINE WILL BE READY, AND THEN EVERYBODY'S GONNA WANT IT. Derek: SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT IDEA TO ME, PHIL. WHY DON'T YOU LET ME DRAW UP THE PATENT PAPERS FOR YOU? NO, I COULDN'T AFFORD YOUR FEE. FORGET IT. I LOVE THE IDEA. YOU CAN PAY ME WHEN YOU SELL THE PROTOTYPE. ALL RIGHT. THANKS! I WISH MY PARENTS WERE ALIVE TO SEE THIS. THEY WOULD BE SO PROUD. Aldys: JUST DO WHAT I TOLD YOU! ( screams ) HOLY SHIT! HEY! GET AWAY FROM HER! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? Aldys: SHE'S FINE. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO, FRIEND. COME ON, MIRANDA. LET'S GO. MIRANDA.
