BLACK SHOES Can we see your permit? My husband will be right back. You can't trade without a permit. M?rcio! They're taking the gold. Quick! Get your father! - Well? What is it? - Marcolino! Show the officers your permit. - What permit? - Please, show us the receipts for his gold in your possession. - What receipts? - Otherwise we shall seize it. - Excuse me! Excuse me! Let me go! Seize my gold? On whose orders?! Who are you to seize my gold? Show me your lD! Calm down. How much do you want? Marcolino! You have to speak to your mother, Dalila. She'll help us. lt wouldn't be the first time. You're her only child, she's bound to help you. Are you listening? Have you gone deaf? l warned you not to bring all the gold from the shop... lnsulting the police was no help either. l have to say it was fun. Very funny. Hilarious. l have a doctor's appointment. What for? l have to go to Lisbon. l think l'm ill. lf it's a nervous breakdown again, forget it. We can't afford shrinks. lt's not that. lt's women's stuff. Dont you ever look around you? l'm looking at you. The lady is a killer. Whom have l killed? Your eyes have torn my soul apart. For you, Madam, 15,000 escudos. Solid gold, 18 carat. And there's the craftsmanship... You won't find that, these days. We've got them with saints too... Good day to you, Madam. What happened to your hair? - Was it the illness? - Yes. Where's the car? How much was all this? Don't you want to know what the doctor said? What did the doctor say? We'll know in a few days. Give me the key. Give me the key. Pompeu! A car broke down in Tanganheira. Can you go there? Monday. lt's Saturday night. l'm sick of this shit. l'm sick of working all hours for no extra money. l'm having a bath. Do you mind if l go to the bar? l will then! My feet are killing me... New shoes. Well, Princez! Don't fret, You're nice, tall, and hairy-arsed... Very cool! - They let you out of jail? - Don't be mean to your bro. You were inside and l was left the tow-truck. As soon as l got home, she sacked the driver. Well, how are you? Your lot are giving me a hard time. - Two of them turned up... - l know. Dont get rattled. lm not rattled! But take care of it then. - We'll have a chat. - We will? All right, then. Your hair looks good like that. How was it at the doctor's? l have to go there again. Shall we open the dance? Has your wife had a makeover? She went to Lisbon, and spent money we haven't got. l could suck him until he made my eyes roll back! - lt would even squirt! - Look at that arse. lf l took her from behind... ... her hair would change colour again! Did they look after you, Caixinha? Damn straight! Nothing but the best. l've got some business to take care of. Excuse me! May l ask what name your mother gave you? - Dalila. - Dalila. Are you married, Miss? - Happily. - l don't believe you. Can you let your bro borrow your girlfriend? l won't spoil her for you. Just so l can have a little dance. Give me your hand. Powerful music, people having a great time, wonderful women, their bodies laughing... it's a dream. l so need a girl to dance with. Do you dance? Do l, Erc?lia? lf he didn't run you over this morning, he won't step on your feet tonight. - You're holding me too tight. - Loosen up. - l can't. You won't let me. - Do you want me to? - l do. - Seriously? Do you believe in the stars? l do. We could watch our destiny from the balcony... That might be a good idea. l'd feel less crowded. - Did you want to dance? - Have you seen my boy? He must be at the slot machines... Let's go home. Hey, girl! l don't want to. l don't feel like it. Would it be too difficult to try and please me? l don't feel like it. l've got my period. But if it was the cock of that guy you kissed, you'd be in the mood! Your period was no excuse then. You just wanted to feel it shoved in you, full of blood and all. l've got a nice one for you too. - Here, feel it! - l'm watching TV now! My little blonde loves turning them on, doesn't she? Doesn't she? ls that what you like? ls it? Because l'm really hot... Turn over! Come here... l'd like to see a watch. - What sort of watch? - Something nice... - How much do you want to spend? - lt doesn't matter. A lady's watch. Where's your husband? He's gone on his gold round. He sells in the villages... Can you put it on your wrist? - Me? - Yes. lt looks good on you. l don't even know your name. Pompeu. l'm opening a pizza place in Mexico. ln Mexico? l spent a year in Mexico City. l'm going back. lt's a place with a future. 5,000,000 escudos is all you need, and you're your own boss. No one bugs you! Come here. How come you're so lucky? l don't know. And you? lt was a dream l had. The dream was you. You're leaving after the holiday. l already have the results of the tests. l have to go back to Lisbon for more tests. lt seems l have breast cancer. l'll take you to Lisbon. Let me grab a sandwich and we can go. Someone should keep an eye on the shop. l may have to stay overnight. Forget the shop. l'm coming with you. l've already got a lift with someone else. We can't afford to close the shop. Who's giving you a lift? A lad from Sines, his mother is in the hospital there... - She's dying - Leave him. l can't. He's totally hung up on me... l don't blame him! l'm hung up on you too. Really? l can't think why. One look at you and l want to gobble you up. You be careful. l need you. l love your ears, l love your eyes... l love your neck, l love your tits... ...l love your thighs... l love your feet... l'll die... lf you leave me, l'll die! l need you to go on living. What's this thing? lt's my ticket to France. l'm leaving in a week. Are you abandoning me? l could never abandon my sole reason for living... Then give me the ticket. lf you do, l'll believe you love me forever. l've found a new life, l don't want to die all over again. Then don't. Those tits must be firm, without lumps. These are the loveliest tits in the whole world. l have to go to the cancer clinic. l may need an operation. l am scared. They'll cut me up and ruin me. You don't know what it's like not having a breast. lt's shameful... lt's the worst thing in the world. You feel crippled... You're no longer whole. You lose your pride. Awoman cant lose her pride. At last! lt's you! How's M?rcio? Does he miss me? Yes. He asked about you. And l miss you too. A lot. Good. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. How did you get in here? l said l was your lover. You're so silly. And sweet. l can't laugh. lt hurts. Did you keep both? - Both what? - Tits! They didn't get rid of one? No. Great! Take it off! Take... Come give your mother a big hug. You shouldn't be washing-up. That's no job for a man. Hi! Mum's doing really well. l'll make the coffee. l'm sorry, l have something really important to discuss. Not now, please... There's a problem at the bank. Either we get a mortgage or they close the shop. The shop is mine. lt's too soon to close. l have a licence. Open your eyes, Dalila! l can't sign the mortgage without you... What mortgage? Don't touch me... At the bank. lf we don't sign, they'll close the shop. l've got the forms. What forms? Are you out of your mind? What have you done? - l've asked for a loan. - Against my shop? My family's shop? Who gave you the right? Let's not argue. l'm your husband, that's what gave me the right! - What could l do? - l don't know and l don't care. lf you don't sign, they'll close the shop. l should never have married you. You're good for nothing. You've wasted my money, and you want to wreck my life. Stop it, Dad! Don't upset Mum! - Don't wake her up! - Let him touch Mum. He won't hurt me... He's come to see Mum. You still love me. You haven't left me... l was sick with longing. Do you need anything else? Good night. l only want to see... Listen! You don't need to be so rough! Look, this is interesting... Look at these watches. They might sell... They're too fancy They won't sell. l could even buy you one... People don't invest in costume jewellery. Dalila. How are your boobies? Marcolino! Behave! - These bandages are scary. - You're hurting me! Let go! Let go! Stop it, you bastard! - You bastard! - Go on, spit! Spit in my mouth! Spit! Slag! l'm your husband, aren't l? Can't a husband see his wife's breasts? Can't he?! Move! Move!!! What have you done to my breasts? You bitch! l'll kill you! You ought to know. Go on. Don't worry about me. Tell her if she doesn't like the colour, she can change it. l will. lt was time she had her own car. l want a divorce. Let me look at you... You look awful. l've never understood why you bought this house. - This neighbourhood is ghastly. - No one asked you to come. Your husband did. Marcolino is worried. He rang to say you had breast cancer... Do you? He wants me to borrow more money. Two weeks ago the gold was confiscated because his lordship didn't bother to apply for the permit. The day before yesterday he found out there was no money to pay the bank and we had to mortgage of the shop. Now, the genius wants to buy a new car! Men can't handle the feeling of guilt. You can make a fresh start. You were always good at that. You can do it again. l don't want to. l'm sick of that. - What about my grandson? - What about him? He won't be the first child to have divorced parents. But it would be MY grandchild with a divorced mother. - He'll be your grandchild anyway! - But you won't be my daughter. l'll pay off the mortgage. l'll look after M?rcio if necessary... ... but l will not contemplate separation. How much do you need? You don't know whether you want to live with me? - l do. - Do you know what you have to do? Would you kill a man? Hang on a sec... - Are you thinking it over? - No. l'm trying to piss. l've an idea... you're in the shit. No one's interested in your ideas. l'll tell you anyway. The bitch has got you by the balls. lf you so much as blink, she'll chop them off. lt's not a very nice picture. You've got a big mouth! You're all talk. That's how l see it! l'll repeat it... in other words. l won't help a faggot who got conned by some bitch. lf you want to please the peroxide jeweller, kill the bloke yourself. lf you have the balls, that is... l'm on parole. l have to show l'm on the mend, l've got a job And l'm a useful member of society. Get it? Run back to France, bro. Run off and don't come back. Shit! No bleedin' cars! - Where are you off to? - Good evening. To Lisbon, you can drop me off on the way. l have to sort out the room. Come in. Are you running from me? Kind of. Pompeu. That's me. Won't you give me a kiss? ls that why you've come? Think of it as a job. lt's payment in advance. l was going to join you. You'd make 10,000,000 escudos Towards your pizza place in Mexico. You don't have to do anything. Just let me die. He was mugged once before. Really? l'm starving. l want to go to a posh restaurant. Those shoes make me want to feel you all over. - l've just remembered you've gone. - l've gone? Your plane took off at one p. m. So, l'm in Paris! Our love is poisoned. And who am l? Say you're my brother. That goes down well. Okay. And you've lost sight of your brother. Right? lt's like this. Call him and arrange to meet. On the phone, just say it's a little job, no problems. Don't mention numbers, You might scare him off! Right. Bye. You haven't seen yet what l got in Lisbon. This is to look smart at his funeral. You're hoping he'll die before you have to give it to some old beggar? l'm only trying to forget l'll be the first to go. Don't be silly! What lovely shoes! Were they cheap? They're Tenente. 35,000 escudos. - You see? lt's Holy Mary. - Beautiful. The work of an artist... Look at the feet Shall l serve the lady? No, l'll deal with her. And how much is this? lt's 12,500 escudos, but for you l'll make 10,000. So that's settled. l'll come by tomorrow to fetch it. Daly Jeweller's. Good morning. Speaking... Can l help you? Tomorrow at noon... On the Cercal road. Naturally. Don't worry. l'll tell my husband right away. Thank you. Dalila... - Dalila! - l'm here. Where were you the last night? ln Lisbon. At the doctor's. l told you. - You don't tell me anything anymore. - You don't listen to me. What have l done? Are you mad at me? No. Oh, l nearly forgot! You have to go to Cercal tomorrow. Awoman wants to buy a bracelet as a wedding present. - Must it be tomorrow? At two o'clock sharp. Come here. Sit down... Things aren't right with us, are they? lt's my fault. Things will change. l'll be better from now on. Dalila, look at me. Am l still your husband? l've never known another. We'll fetch M?rcio from school and go for a drive. Let's have a picnic, like we used to. ls C?ndido in? C?ndido? ls that the weapon? Yes. lt's my Marcolino's shotgun. Everyone has their own preferences. - And my case? - lt's in his car. lt's him! That's him? - Yes. - What are you waiting for? Show yourself. Get down there. Dalila? What's this? Dalila, what's happened? What are you doing here? Tell me! What is it? Come here! Dont run! Are you mad or what? What are you doing here? Where are you going? Don't run off, Dalila! Come here, Dalila! Dalila! Don't go, Dalila! Wait! Wait for me, Dalila! What's the matter? My friend... l don't like shooting people in the back. Take his wallet! Mexican cooking is full of cheese. Tacos have cheese, Fried peppers have cheese... lt's like pizza, really. l need two new pizzas as a speciality. l think l've come up with them. The Mexicana and the Macho Moreno! The Mexican has chili con carne, but not minced meat, l'll use proper slices of beef. The Macho Moreno is really original. l've been thinking... - Kiss me. - Why are we here? You're staying here! You won't die of starvation, nor from lack of love... Not now... What's this? lt's for you. A present, to bring you luck. l want you to promise me, darling... What? That you won't go out, you can't even walk around the house. - No one must know you are here. - Why not? Because you've just killed a man. We've just killed a man. Don't be stupid! What are you still doing here? l was worried. Marcolino isn't back, yet. - Not back? - And you were taking your time too. l had so much to do. Where's M?rcio? Sleeping. He's fine. ''To Marcolino... ''... from your ever-loving... ... Dalila.'' - Listen, this isn't right! l've been here for half an hour, waiting for lnspector Pinto. l'm sorry, Madam, but what makes you think your husband has not merely been delayed... for a private reason? My husband's missing. - Missing? - Yes. Since this morning. lt happens. lt happens that l thought the police were there to help people. My husband is a jeweller. When jewellers carrying 2kg of gold, vanish... There might just be a reason other than some affair. Perhaps you do not think so, lnspector Pinto? Mum! Has something happened to Dad? What could ever happen to Dad? Why did you give him the gold? l didn't. You didn't?! What are you going to do now? l don't know. They only found the car today. Get in! Get in! Get in! - Are you crazy? - Me? l told you not to leave the house! l was getting bored. When a guy is closed up like that, he feels like he's in jail. l only came out for a stroll... - They found the car today. - Car? What car? Jesus! l'll come tomorrow at about 10 p. m. l'll give you money for a month or two in France. l can't have you wandering around here. lt's dangerous, darling. They'd work it all out... l'll join you in France soon. l love you, sweetheart. We'll take your statement. Does it concern your husband's disappearance? Yes. Do you have anything important to add? Yes. l had an affair. My husband was unaware of this. Today at noon, l met my lover. l noticed a medallion around his neck, which l had given my husband before we were married. My lover does not know my husband. The only reason for having the medallion is that he is responsible for my husband's disappearance or because he knows who is responsible. You seem very serene. l am as l am. Calm... ... or frigid? Calm. l am not a frigid woman, lnspector Pinto. Glad to hear it. Pompeu Caixinha, we know you are in there. We know you are armed. Come out with your hands up. Shall we go? l'm not getting into that car. l won't speak to that man. lt was her. She made me do it. - Do what? - Kill her husband. And did you? l hired a killer in Lisbon. C?ndido. C?ndido? Where was he killed? Here... - Here where? - On this road. Here. Stop the car. - On this road? - Yes. Take him. l apologize, Madam. l am very sorry. - ls it him? - Yes. l must see him. lt's not something a lady should see. You bitch! You lying bitch! Get him out of my sight. - That man killed my husband. - lt was you! He destroyed a happy family. - May you be cursed in hell. - l did nothing, you bitch! Take him to the station. l'll deal with him later. She told me to kill him! Lying bitch! l do apologize, Madam. l'm sorry for your boy. Death is always brutal, whatever one's age, whatever the circumstances. But Marcolino's death is worse, because it was premeditated. Lord, fount and origin of infinite mercy, remind us how brief life is, and uncertain the hour of death. Let the Holy Spirit guide us, that we may live in justice and righteousness, as long as we live. May we live in the light of Faith and the communion of Love, that we may one day enter, rejoicing into Your Kingdom. May we resurrect as is resurrected our brother Marcolino, into eternal life. ln the name of the Father and the Son and the glory of the Holy Spirit... ... Amen. l'd like to ask you something, may l? Why were you so taken with Dalila's new shoes? She showed them to me before Marcolino's death. When l saw them, l came to conclusion. l never thought she knew her husband would be killed. But she already knew. When l saw the shoes, l couldn't believe my eyes. How did she know, two days before, he would die? Afternoon, thought l'd call in. Come in. Forgive the mess. Mind if l look around? l've always been interested in interiors. Are you leaving? What do you think you're doing? l'm gathering evidence, without a warrant, which is not allowed. l have reason to believe that the contents of this bag and this pair of shoes may confirm Mr Pompeu Caixinha's tertimony. Get out of here! They'll convict you of conspiracy to murder your husband, namely my dear old friend, Marcolino Barrote, a respected citizen of this town. - You can't do that! You have no right! You can't trust that ruffian! l cannot be incriminated by a murderer. He can prove nothing! Hello? lt's me. A car to Vasco da Gama, 4. We have a few minutes before the car gets here, Madam. The accusation may not be in your favour. So, l would not shout too loud. You may wish to consider your statement, in case it needs adjusting. Do you follow? We must consider this evidence. Do you see, Madam? The gold should have been in your husband's car. lt should have been stolen by the murderer. lnstead, l find it in your room, which needs clarifying. Then, there are these shoes... A problem... Because a witness states that Dalila bought them three days before her husband died. The witness reports that Dalila declared she would wear them to her husband's funeral. Two days before he died. Do you see the problem? How will we explain all this?
