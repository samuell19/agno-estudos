- And that. - All right mademoiselle. - No I'll eat it here. - I see you have a sweet tooth. - Oh no, this is my dinner today. This is the fish, salad, vegetable and cheese. I'm on a hunger strike. It's very hard to explain. No Emile. - So you won't eat a thing? Maybe you think you're Gandhi, eh? - Philippe, if you can't behave yourself at the table, you'll go upstairs to your room immediately and no dessert. - Father I don't want any dessert either. May I please have permission to go up to my room? - I've lost my appetite, coffee. Just like a mule. The splendid girl, a true Durvele. - I don't know what to say, my dear. She's just as stubborn as you, but at this rate she's going to get sick. - A good time to have her taken care of by her veterinarian. - Oh my dear he's a doctor, sugar? - Two. I think this is a bad situation. - Look dear I'm sorry. - I'm sorry that you insist on defending Sophie. You should help me try to talk some sense into that girl. She's only 18, excellent family. Alone in Paris, the Latin quarter to boot. The home of anarchists and degenerates? - All alone? But there are several million people in Paris. - And how many white slavers and sex maniacs, huh? - Oh you exaggerate. - Ah I was waiting for that. Read this, here. Look at the terrible thing that happened yesterday morning. - Is it my fault that the art school's in Paris and not Lyon? - The art school, the artistic aspirations of our genius Sophie. Well she can draw just as well here in Lyon as in Paris. Michelangelo, Leonard Da Vinci, did they go to a Paris school? And they didn't draw too badly, admit it. - I really don't think you're being quite fair. - Now listen, you're not fooling me. Sophie's only desire is to meet with this Jack. I won't allow it to happen. - Don't get excited. - Oh don't get excited yourself. Sophie's not going to chase after a man who studies nude women all the time. - Well, Jack's from an excellent family. - Well I'd love him to stay in his excellent family and away from mine. - Some hors d'oeuvres or more champagne? - I'll take some champagne. - There. - Thanks. - Is the champagne holding out? - Don't worry mademoiselle, I've taken precautions. - Fine. - I had to tell him I wouldn't see him after tonight. He wanted to know why. - Champagne? - Yes please. Oh there's Andre and Jack. - Sophie I'd like to present a schoolmate. My old friend Dr. Jack Berson. We're like brothers. - Very old, almost bald. - Hello. - Hello. It's really very good of you... To have come. - To have asked me. Shall we? - All right. Tomorrow you'll be back in Paris. - I know, that's all I've been thinking about. I don't know the customs here in Lyon, but when two people are very much in love how do they say goodbye? With lovers I guess it's exactly the same all over the world. Right left right left right left very well, now take a deep breath and jump jump jump jump. - Sophie you foolish girl. - You afraid I'll catch cold? - Standing half naked in front of an open window. Someone will see you. - You're just old fashioned. I know it's true that in your day, even a girl at the beach... - Listen to me, young lady. I want you to know in my day it wasn't necessary to exhibit one's self in a bikini. It just so happens you're not at the beach right now. At the moment you're here in your room, it's shocking. - Your father's gone, I've arranged all this without telling him. - Oh you're wonderful. You know if I don't go to Paris, Mama, Jack will forget all about me. - In my day they didn't forget so fast. Don't worry Sophie, I've just had a letter from your aunt in Paris and it's all right if you go to live with her. - Oh thank you Mama, surely Papa will agree to that. - Hm, but when he says no he means no. A true Durvele. - Just like a mule. - Oh Sophie. - Hey you're back to eating. - Pass the bread idiot. - Your starvation appears to be over. - Oh listen dear, we've received a letter from my sister in Paris. - So, still doing her fashionable charities? - She's made us a proposition concerning Sophie. - Ah? - We'd like your opinion. Have you nothing to say? - An opinion? Well, quite a little scheme. I congratulate you both. So be it. Since I'm outnumbered, I'm always wrong. I'll agree to let you go, but I disapprove. Beginning tomorrow I'm holding your sister responsible. Entirely responsible to you for anything which may happen, do you hear? Anything. - There, car three. - It's fine. - Mademoiselle, permit me to wish you a good journey and a happy stay in Paris. We're all going to miss you around the house. - I'll miss you too, Emile. - Thank you sir. - For my father, since he didn't want to get it in person, you can give it to him. - I'll be sure to. - Would you please get me some newspapers? - You! - Movie World, Movie Review. And The Condemned Man Escapes. Swell. Will you pay Emile, please? - Goodbye mademoiselle. - Bye! Porter. - Yes miss. Mademoiselle Durvele? - What is it? Your aunt is unable to meet you. She's been detained at a charity auction. - Very well. - If you'll come with me. - Thank you. - Hurry up we're late now. I don't want to miss her. Sophie! Listen you go that way, we'll catch 'em on the next block. Sophie. - Jack! - May I present Hubert, my good friend. And Brutus, the celebrated artist in residence. And the I seven for your first trip through Paris. - My aunt? - She knows. - But you've never met. - I had the good sense to call her this morning. You have permission to stay out 'til midnight. - That's fine, you may return without me. My aunt knows. - Baby. - Don't paw me. - Well look you don't have to be ritzy. I know you pose at the art school. - I still don't like being handled by you. - A scotch. - Hello, hi. Hi. - Ah Jack. The most romantic young doctor in Paris, suburbs included. - Ah ah, ah ah. - Elena, very good friend of Brutus. Charming and loving couple. Sit down. - I must say you took your time. We're going to be late at the club. Ready? - Right, we'll see you at the club. - We'll be there later. Drink? - I guess I'll have a lemonade. - You order as if you were 15. A lemonade and one double scotch. I'm going to step out and call the hospital and check on the state of our oozing tumor, ah. You better make that order for two double scotches because I think the young lady's about to faint. - Hello there. Say, besides staying pretty, what do you do with yourself? Pose, perhaps you paint? No, romance? Oh but even that can become boring. I do the same, nothing at all. - Nothing? I thought you were dressed like a character as a tourist attraction. - Well, the patient and the tumor are both very good. - Who was that idiot who was here just now? - I don't know him. - But that isn't right. - You're really adorable. We better think about going, see Brutus. Drink up. - I'd prefer to... - To what? - Just sit awhile. We have so much to say to each other. - We've got our whole lives to do that. Now let's have some fun, come on. - Hello Jackie. - Who's that girl? - Someone I know slightly. - But I just saw her kiss you. - Oh Sophie, this is Paris. - It's our song. - All right the siesta is finished. One, two, one two three four. - That's quite a character you know. Don't you wish you could dance that way? - No. - I see. You're an intellectual. That's fashionable too. - Good for me. - Well you're really out of place in this sort of night club. You should go home. You won't like the floor show. - Well now are you two girls getting acquainted? I had a feeling you'd get along. - Jack I'm leaving. - Why Sophie? - What does it matter? I just want to get out of here. - The first thing I'll do next time you come to Paris is take you right to church. - I'm really very sleepy. - All right, let's go. - Good. Left right left right left right... - Good morning darling. Oh the window's wide open, that's very foolish. - Are you afraid the neighbors will see me? - No darling, but you might catch a nasty cold. Ah, excuse me for not meeting you at the station today but with the charity sale I had all the responsibility. We had a huge crowd, it was a big success. But then these things always are. - Auntie, I want to thank you very much for keeping me during... - Keeping you? Oh what a word. Oh what was I saying? Oh I remember now. He's charming, your boyfriend. At least from what I can tell on the phone. Very fine man and so sauve, absolutely adorable. But then he must be if you're in love with him. - Oh Jack, I do love him... - And your mother tells me he's attached to the embassy, how perfectly marvelous. Ah no, it isn't that one at all, he's a, oh never mind. He's a, a lawyer your charming young man. - Medical student. - Ah medicine, oh it's marvelous. Imagine devoting your life to saving the lives of strangers. Still, I couldn't be married to a doctor. Having all those little microbes running in and out of the house. Well no matter, when are you getting engaged? Please tell me. Come in. Ah just put it over here please. We're going to have tea and crackers. - All right. - Well aren't you hungry? - At home I get chocolate cake and ice cream. - Oh but no darling, that's very bad for your figure, very bad. Oh the telephone, it's impossible. Hello? Hello my dear. Oh no of course I didn't forget. Four o'clock at the art gallery. The opening of the sensational Von Ditier. Everyone we know will be there. Janeau, Marcelle, Jean, yes! This woman will never shut up. You're so pretty my sweet, my angel. Yes but you can explain all that to me at the exhibition, bye-bye! Sophie, you must come to the exhibition. You're interested in painting and all that. - I'd love it. Who's there? - The masseuse is here madame. - Thanks I'll be there in a minute. And I'll see you at four. Oh that's the way it is every day and you wonder why I'm tired. It's been such fun chatting with you. I feel I know you better. The telephone, I never get a minute's peace. Hello. Yes? Ah, yes well just a minute. It's for you my dear. See you later. - Who is it? Oh Jack I'm glad it's you. How are you? No impossible, I have to go to an exhibition of Pedro or somebody. Yes that's the one. Do you mean to say that you're going to be there? That's wonderful darling. I'll look for you then, bye now. - A genius, full of life. - Ah there you are Francine. - Hello dear. - Darling there are so many wonderful things on display. Utterly sublime. Grips my heart. - Cuckoo. - Oh how are you Jack? - Hello Sophie. - Quite a crowd here. - All of Paris. Don't speak, and you'll appear intelligent. - Let's go see my aunt. I want her to meet. - My book's about a housewife who turns to prostitution. - Oh have you given up poetry? - Well just for a while. I love it, it's so exciting. Do you like the title, the Sadist is No Choir Boy. - Marvelous, isn't that the famous painting Nude with a Violin? - Oh but no, that's the purple on purple. - Allow me there has been a mistake. This is my greatest creation, Fire the Waxworks. Beautiful isn't it? Oh, my admirer. - Dear great great Didier. This exhibit is so, so, words fail me. It's so simple, yet complex. - Dear Pedro. - Oh! - Superb, heroic, magnificent. - Merci dear Jack. Do you know every bit of me is in that masterpiece? - Why of course, throughout the picture I can see. - Let me present our future Pasteur, Dr. Jack Berson. - Jack Berson? But I know him well, after all it's my niece that knows him well. This is Sophie Durvele, Jack's fiancee. - Magnificent, I see the resemblance, I am your slave. Excuse me, I see someone. - Hurry back. Madame would you please permit me to take Sophie for a discussion of Anglo-Saxons of the feudal era? - Yes of course, it sounds splendid. Run along. He's just marvelous, and so charming. - You don't really think that painter is talented. - Of course not, but you have to say that. - But even if you don't mean it? - Well that's life in the big city. Everybody's extremely polite while they thumb their nose at you, you'll learn. - What an odor. Are you using perfume now? - That's from a nurse I drove to the hospital. - I'll bet they could use it for an anesthetic. - Let's go. - To the lecture? - Yeah. - Good. - Hi Jack, gonna rock tonight? - Uh not tonight. - How's it going Jack? - Hey, how are ya? - How well do you know that girl who keeps kissing you? - Not terribly. - Do you work together at the hospital? - The hospital? - That's right, is she the nurse? - Sophie what are you talking about? - With the perfume that stinks up your Isetta? I want to say this, Jack. I know I'm not sophisticated, but that's also true of you. You're a real farmer. No matter how late you're up, you still go to bed with the chickens. Goodnight. - Listen Sophie, don't be ridiculous. I'll take whatever it is. - How are ya professor? - Hands off Joe. - She's pretty good huh? But not as good as our Rita. - Ah Rita, you keep away. I'm sorry I said what I did because Rita and I are well. - Hello? Dr. Berson? No, mademoiselle isn't at home yet. - Hello, I think Sophie is a kook. What does she mean she isn't home yet? I just talked to her. Hm, loopy. Hello Elena. I hope you don't think I've been drinking. - You'll drown if you don't stop. - Two of these if you please. Here we are now. What a story. Wanna hear it? - Here for nearly an hour, come on. - Can I borrow your blue? Thanks. You know, the more I look at her the more I see a guitar. - The more I look at her the more I see a great figure. - Time's up. - Learn much? - Oh a bit. - Good. Have you seen Jack? - No and I don't care to. - You're still quarreling? - Is it my fault? - You know Jack got drunk when you left last night. - Oh that must have been so terribly cute. - A man usually speaks the truth when he's like that. As a matter of fact it's really the only time. - I'm not interested. - But Sophie he's in love with you. - Well I don't want to be loved like that. - Try to understand, we're all good friends of Rita's. We try to discourage you, but Jack's in love. Won't you believe me? Let's be friends. - Why do you care? - Wilts and I both love Jack. - I'm sorry, but he's not for me. - You're very silly. - Goodbye. - All right. - Oh you're crying! - No. - What's the matter with you? You poor child. Left the house except to go to school for over two weeks. What is it? - I'm through with Jack. - Oh ho is that all? You shouldn't take too long to get over these lover's quarrels. Try to make up. - But he takes out other women. He knows every glamor girl in Paris. - Oh my sweet little dove, all men change after marriage. With women it's different. We only have to behave ourselves until we're married. Now pull yourself together, get up off the bed on your feet, on your feet. Ah, so he prefers glamor girls you say? We'll give him one. First we're going to change your hairstyle. We'll put this over there, now keep your head up. You're lovely, Sophie. - Oh I'm so happy. - Oh no no no you'll muss your hair. Now a little dash of perfume. There, there, and there, all right. Now walk over there and get your bag so I can see how you look. Perfect, you couldn't look better darling. Now is that everything? Oh, we mustn't forget your gloves. My dear, go now. You're ravishing! Have a good time. - Ladies and gentlemen you have just seen Mustache and his company in Impressions of the Orient. - Jackie. Come back. - Don't worry I'm here. - Do you miss your art student? Will I see you tomorrow? - Rita I remember, five o'clock tomorrow. - Please remember. I'm on, I've got to get dressed. - She dresses to undress. - It's real silk, you can take my word for it. - All right, like to dance? - If you want. - Sophie! You're in here with Joe? - Relax professor, I'm her agent. - Good for you, and I'm Napoleon. - But he promised to teach me rock and roll. - If she wants to know anything, she'll learn it from me hm? - You win, bye-bye baby. - You look really great. It's good seeing you, Sophie. I don't think I like having you dance with our friend Joe from now on. - But I'm trying to grow up. - All right, but not all at once. - The princes of strip tease. - Got a cigarette? - Here. - How can these people strip? - And a good figure. - Just as Rostand said once, "queen of the attitude and princess of gesture." - Oh, about me? - No dear, Sarah Bernhardt. Bernhardt? - Explanation, you roll the dice, she will undress. Each time that you're lucky, you can remove one piece of her costume, how's that? Okay. Presenting. - Come on let's go. - But no it's a new experience for me. - All right? - Perfect. All of a sudden you're different. - What do you mean? - You seem so quiet and so serious. - Oh no, I'm fine. - You're more romantic when you're serious. - You'd get tired of it. - No. I could never get tired of you. - You mean to say that I, I have to be serious to show you that I love you? - But when you're not, you don't seem to be quite as close to me. - Think so? - Oh Jack, what a marvelous day it's been. - Marvelous because we've been together, darling. - Jack? - Yes. - Will they always be marvelous days for us? - Oh yes. Six o'clock already. - Did you forget something? - A friend. It's all right, I really don't want to see him. - Hello? Do I have the hospital? Dr. Berson, please. Yes surely, what? Not there? You mean he wasn't even on duty? Stupid, pardon me I wasn't referring to you. Bye now. - Rita I'm supposed to meet Brutus here. I haven't seen him have you? - Yes, there, he's coming this way. Say what about that little art student? I wonder what she's up to. - I suppose she's just floating around somewhere. - Sorry I'm late. Hi there. - Where's Jack? - Floating around, I don't know. - Oh I see, well that clears up the mystery. He's gonna pay. - You said the wrong thing. - Listen Sophie. - What? - Let's make a call. Tell your aunt we won't be home because the car broke down. - What? You mean? - Yes I do. - Oh no. Angry? - No silly, I adore you. We better hurry or your aunt will throw a fit. Come on, get in. - Is my aunt here? - Yes, inside. - I'm here, your plan worked. Jack loves me. Oh excuse me. - Sophie Durvele, my niece. Father Joseph. - How do you do? - And Sister Agnes from Sacred Heart. How do you do? - Ah what curves. - No time for drooling. We have to get this ready for tonight. - How are you? - Oh hi. - You stood me up. - I had to go somewhere, sorry. - With Sophie huh? - Ah come on, let's drop it huh? - Oh you little stinker. You're very good at dropping things. Oh I understand. It would be very easy to open an office with her money. Oh miserable men. - Hello. What's that? Coming straight over. Hemorrhage, hemorrhage. - Rita are you coming tonight? - No. - We were counting on you. - Why don't you ask Jack's little sissy? Wait, on second thought I think I will go, but promise you won't say a word to Jack. - Not a word. - Hi, did you have a nice day with Jack? - Wonderful. How about that job you told me about? Did you get it? - Nope, again. They wanted an actress who had more experience. I guess I'm stuck with the strip tease. - Strip tease? - Oh I'm used to it. - There's only been one woman who couldn't strip. - Who's that? - Eve. Believe me, she had no clothes. So she had nothing to strip. Am I right? - Now let's see your entrance, Miss Larue. All right. Oh no no no no, watch your legs Miss Larue. - What do you want me to do? - Don't just walk on them. - Why not? - You're a stripper, not a mountain climber. Beautiful legs are not to walk on, but simply to call attention. - To what? - What, what do you think? That wasn't a joke, step down please. Although the strip tease has always been with us, for example the strip tease of Helen to win the golden apple, the strip tease of Salome and the Seven Veils, the strip tease which is familiar to all of us throughout the world today is far more rapid than previously. The name flash strip tease. We're about to give you a demonstration. Lights! - Bravo! - But this rapid style, silence please, is understandably thought to be a little short. Therefore it has been replaced by a new form containing much less heat. All right on stage girls, come on, hurry up now. Music. Ah my queens, all together. - You see you can't avoid it. - Who'd want to? Certainly not me. - One and two and three and four and stay together watch the beat. Stand up straight, keep in step now. That's very good, very good. One and two all right now, for the chest exercises. - If that's his idea of a strip tease I'm going to stick to my own way. - All right, I'll help you. Come on let's go. - Leaving? - Oh yes I've had enough. - A drink first? - All right. - Waitress. Three vermouths please. - Yes sir. - What time do you go on tonight? - 11. - That's right. - Nervous? - No I'm used to it. - Call for a miss Durvele on the telephone. - Oh? Good luck tonight. - Thanks. - All the best. - Hello? Hello Miss Durvele? It's the hospital calling. I'm supposed to give you a message. Dr. Berson wants you to pick him up over here this evening, Miss Durvele. Yes, the students quarters. Right, it's important. Yes, at half past 10, not at all. - 11 o'clock I have to meet my Sophie. - Yeah. - It's the replacement. - Take it easy, get away from her. What now? - That emergency of yours, I can't keep the patient quiet. - I'll be right out. - You can't go like that. - This is very important. - And now for the first time in Europe we present a remarkable demonstration of breathtaking marksmanship. - Very pretty. - Pearl. - You know her? - Yeah bet we can make a deal. Let me try. Nice place huh? Talk about floor shows. This place has it over all the others. Another scotch for the lady. And now we present the most undressed girl in Paris, the beautiful Elena. - A new number, I think you'll like it. - I'll take over, Joe. - Don't touch me. - What have I done? - Get away. - Ah Sophie, you drunk? - No I'm not, and I never want to see you again, never. But if you like girls with nerve, wait here. - Sophie, did you get her drunk? If you did, you're going to be sorry. - Me, why no Jack, I wouldn't... - I'm gonna knock your teeth right down your throat. - Go away and stay away. - What's the matter with Sophie? She mention anything? She wanted to meet you about 10:30. - Do you think I'm crazy? I was with all the nurses. How can I invite Sophie? - Then why did you telephone? - But it wasn't me. - I was there! - Oh this could be a plot of Rita's right? I'm beginning to understand. That's why she ran out of here like that, half crazy. - She could kill herself. - Ah. - Find her, come on. Hold it, good. Don't move a muscle, that's good. - I have to get dressed for my next number. What, are you crazy? What are you doing with my costume? And Jack, what about him? - I don't care about Jack or anything else. - Come on, you're supposed to be on stage. - But... - That isn't Elena. - Doesn't matter, she's doing fine. - Well she's not gonna make a fool of me. I don't let just anybody work up there. I'm gonna have it out with Elena and this... - Durvele, Sophie Durvele for a million. - What do you mean? - Well we have a picture of that strip tease. I want a lot of pictures of this girl's number, and make them good. - Her car's still here. Maybe she's with Elena. - Let's see. - Hey you can't do that, hey! - Good evening, you've witnessed the most beautiful of strip teases. Please, I'll try to explain. This is the strip tease that has no ending. You have to imagine the end of it. What I mean to say is it wouldn't take much to fill in the strip tease with your sweetheart when you get home, or your wives perhaps which is more fun anyway. - Oh it's impossible. What made me go out there? What came over me? - It's because you love Jack. - Yes I'm more in love than ever. But now I'll never get back. It's over. - You see now what jealousy does? - Can you ever forgive me? - You've gone too far. There's much too much to be forgiven. - Then it's over? We're finished. Goodbye forever. - You mean. - Oh Jack, I was so afraid. - I should hope so. Now it's all right. - Sophie, they took a lot of pictures of you. I bet you make the cover of a magazine. What I'd give. - That's nice. Do you mean to say photos? They took pictures of you out there Sophie? What'll we do if your parents ever see them? Wait here. I'm gonna get those negatives. - What do you mean by getting in front of that stage and making a speech? You'll ruin my business! - Ah! Is Sophie all right? - Yes, but this thing isn't over. Hand over those photos. - What photos? - The ones that were taken of Sophie, you know. - Ask the photographer. - You get the girls, the photos, and... - We'll be right out. - Uh pardon me. - A photo sir? - Several, in fact all you've taken tonight. - Of everybody? Impossible, if I were you I... - I don't need any advice right now. I think you'd better give me those pictures you took. I'm calm, quite calm, but I may not stay that way. - But it isn't me, it's the boss, ask her. - The boss? - Yeah. - You lying to me? - No sir. - So, it's her. Will you throw this guy out and try and keep it quiet. - Where are the photos? - I don't have 'em it was Joe who... - And where's Joe? - How do I know, don't ask me. - I think she's lying. - She's too smart for that, come on. I think I know where Joe went. - I hope so. If we don't come up with him, we'll be back for you. Are you ready? The floor show bids you goodnight. - Our pleasure. - I've got the ambulance, we'll get him. - Oh Jack are you sure? - As sure as I love you. We'll telephone you the minute. - Please be careful, Jack. Hello? What's that? Oh no sir, this is not the waxworks. - Well? - Nothing. The bum hasn't even been home yet. We're stuck. - Rita? - If she'd gone home we'd have known it by now. - Here. - Here, careful. They're worth a lot of money and you can get rid of your competition. - Oh it's all over between us. I know when I'm through. - We'll see, now you wait here. - Joe. - Yeah? - Maybe. - What? - Nothing. - No mister, madame isn't up yet. - Tell her that it's very important. - Very well monsieur. Will you kindly go inside and wait? - Drive on please. - I really tried monsieur, but madame sees nobody at this hour. You said it was important? - I'm sorry sir, but nothing's important this early. - Don't you understand? Her niece is in danger at this moment. - Oh I see what you mean. You're on the wrong floor. People upstairs have a niece. Our Miss Sophie is still asleep. - But Sophie is the one. I'm not coming back, this is your last chance to avoid a scandal. - Very well sir. - It's 10 o'clock already, where is everybody? - It's hard to steal an ambulance. Hope they can get away with it. - No one seems to be able to find Rita. - Hello. - Hi. - Where's Joe? - Joe, why? Do you want a strip tease? - If you don't tell me where I can find Joe right now... - Oh relax, I'll tell you. It's no secret. He's going to all the newspapers with photos of the new strip tease queen. Uh, Sophie Durvele. - We've got to head him off. Let's hurry, you'll pay for this I promise you. - Oh speaking of photos, look here. - Another trick? - Have a look. - Sophie's pictures. - With my compliments. And the negatives. That's your wedding present. Joe's at her aunt's trying to get money. - Go. - Come on let's go. - I'll follow you. Thanks, Rita. You've been a good friend. Like you used to. - That's the way it goes. Family, children. Me? Strip tease. - To tell you the truth, your story is absolutely mystifying. She doesn't dance, and besides she's a student. - Now let me start over, you're... - Thank you for dropping over, but now I must go, excuse me. I'm late, my hairdresser's waiting. - The man who's got the photos wants $2,000 right away. To save the honor of a family like yours it should be worth it. - Worth it? - You know that I'm a friend, understand? I'd pay it if it were possible. - You're sweet. - I don't have it! - Neither do I. - Take the stretcher will you. - Do me a favor, come back here when we've had time to send someone to the bank. - You don't believe me. - Oh I wouldn't say that. - Suppose I show you one of the photos, what then? - It's useless, useless... - Look at this. - Ah found, excuse me madam for disturbing you at this hour. Don't be upset, he's harmless enough. - What's the matter Jack? - It's all right. - I knew by his face he was a halfwit. - He's a poor imbecile who was confined to the hospital. Today he stole some photographs of mine, the idiot. Right out of my room, ones of Sophie. Did he try to get money from you? - Oh a fortune! Oh imagine Sophie Durvele a strip tease in a night club. Oh what an idea! He's a moron. - Let's go. March it. - We're going to have a nice, cold shower. I hope we didn't disturb you. - Hurry up out. - Isn't that sweet? - It's high time they got married. - Yes. - Sophie I'm going to arrange it for your father. I can't handle lover's quarrels on my schedule, it's too much. - But remember, he's a true Durvele. When he says no... - He means yes, you know that. - The wedding is not only the first day of an indestructible union between two who esteem and love each other, and who represent not only the qualities of man but also the continuity of families, so typical of our way of life. They remain a guarantee in the hope of calm and confident tomorrows for all of us, and assurance of prosperity for the entire country. It's an example also, as if you didn't know, of the link between our own city of Lyon and the romantic city of Paris. - Hey! - Jack? - Yeah. - Would you do me a favor? - Anything. - Would you please? Turn out the light.
