Everything looks so good. Yeah. Hey, hey, there's not gonna be any left. I'm hungry, okay. And didn't we just do this? That was a year ago, remember, when you recruited me. Mm, you're right. God, that was such a mistake. Does this look right? Is this everything? God, I hope so. I'm already exhausted, and we haven't even started yet. I still think we need to spike the lemonade. Whoever goes for seconds has my vote. Okay, who is the big sister, again? What? I'm a big kid at heart. Sisters, can I have your attention? Ahem, listen up! Today, somewhere within the group of those young, Potential new members, we will meet our newest Beta delta chi sisters! And I want you all to remember that you Were once where they are. Searching. Feeling lost. Before you found your? sisters for life! Ladies, here we go! Bd chi, bd chi, bd chi. say cheese. So what makes you want to be a beta delta chi sister? College is so new to me. I come from a really small town. So I think making some roots would really help me adjust. So, what's your major? First I was elementary ed, and then I realized, ew, kids. So I switched to premed. I'll be honest. I'm only at college for my Mrs degree. I'm Cori, with an I. You should know upfront that this is The only house I'm pledging. Why is that, Cori with an I? My mom and sister are both beta delta chi, And I'm gonna keep the tradition going. See? You're a legacy candidate, that's great. Make sure you mark that down. And then I thought maybe business would be a better path. Honestly, I figured it'd be a good place to party, Go to some ragers, you know. I knew I liked you. Yeah, thank you so much. We're gonna call you. Y'all seem so nice, not like some of the other houses. This house smells so good. - oh thanks. - Is that anise? I have this nose thing. And now I think I might try musical theater. I'm just gonna put undecided. Very. I need a break. Good idea. I'm gonna go refill the pretzel bowl. Do you need anything? Hi, are you here to rush? I am. I was just admiring the beta delta chi history. Such tradition here. Yeah, we work hard to maintain it. It's so inspiring, the sisterhood of it all. I can't wait to be a part of it. I'm Jana. Oh, right, sorry. Guess I'm getting a little ahead of myself. I'm Bailee. Why don't we start your interview. Oh, so it says you transferred in. I did. My last school just never really felt like home, you know? I do. I was a transfer myself. Really? How funny. That's why your motto is so inspiring to me. Sisters for life. I think finding those few people you can rely on In your life no matter what is so important. oh, Ari, this is Bailee. Arielle was assigned as my big sister When I got accepted, and we've been like, Well, sisters, ever since. Can I ask, how are big sisters assigned? Someone volunteers, and then the sorority votes. So you could be my big? It's possible, yeah. Have you checked out any of the other houses yet? A few, yeah, but I'm sort of set on yours. Can I ask what made you wanna join? I was looking for a family. Some place I could call home. Somewhere I felt like I belonged. I couldn't agree more. There's nothing more important than family. So, we're definitely gonna be Getting back to you, Bailee. It was so nice to meet you. Oh, wait. Your file. One, two. Great. She seemed nice. Was that her interview or yours? Just saying. That's a pass on undecided. So I think we all agreed on Samantha, yes? good. Which leaves space for one more. I thought bailey was sweet. I think she'll be a good addition. Really? Yeah, she reminded me of me when I first came here. What, a lost lamb? I think she's searching for something. And maybe we're it. Well that's great. You can friend her on social. Cori, however, is a legacy. Her mom and her sister were both beta delta chis. All in favor? I hate this. There's always next time. how they looking today? Still alive and kicking. Jana, I've been looking over your lab reports. Okay, is there a problem? Actually, no, quite the opposite. I'm very impressed with your work. There's a position open on the research team, And I need to find a replacement. I'd like you to consider it. Really? But, before you say yes, I need you to know That it is quite a bit of work. We're conducting studies with six other universities, So I need someone who will be on top of every detail. Yes, of course. I mean, the pay is lousy, but it will look great On your grad school application. It's paid, too? Yes, absolutely. I need you to understand what a huge deal this is. Our entire grant is relying on it. I hope that won't cause any problems With your sorority obligations. Oh no, not at all. I've got this, I promise. Good, I'll arrange for you to get A keycard and serve access. Why you don't start familiar- izing yourself with the study, And we'll talk tomorrow after class? Thank you, Dr. Leeman, thank you so much. Don't disappoint me, Jana. that's a lotta binders. Yeah, but it's a huge opportunity for me. And it'll have big sway with master's programs. That's terrific, baby. You deserve it. You've worked really hard. But it is gonna mean even less time together. Only until the grant gets submitted. But now for the hard part. All of this lab data. Oh, what did I get myself into? Ugh, god, that feels good. Magic hands, like I said. I think you just found the name for your pt offices. That would probably get me arrested. That's all right, I'll bail you out. I certainly hope so. Well, only for a lifetime of free massages. - We're negotiating my bail? - Mm-hm. Maybe I'll take my chances in jail. Mm-hm. Jana. Bailee. I was hoping I'd run into you. Any idea when the sorority might make their decision? About that, um, The sorority made their selections. I'm sorry. But I thought we connected. We did, and I want you to know That I thought you were great. - I pushed really hard for... - did you? Yes, but there were only a few openings And we had a legacy candidate. Oh, so I was better qualified but didn't get in Because of the pan-Hellenic bureaucracy? That makes me feel much better. I'm sorry, really. But there are rules we have to follow. Please, I hope you'll try again in the spring. I know there are at least three sisters graduating. I have three other houses asking, So I don't think I'll be needing to. That's great. I'm really happy for you. And it was, it was great meeting you And I'm sure I'll see you around campus. Sure, thanks for letting me know. Everything okay? Yeah, all good. cori! Well you know, if you accept. of course I accept. Oh my gosh. Great, I think that's everything. Well, nice meeting you. Arielle, hurry up, we're gonna be late. Sorry. My bad. Didn't mean to scare you. I'm Jim Carter with campus security. I need to speak with the ladies who met with cori Mendel. - Oh. - Okay, of course. attacked? She's still unconscious, But the doctors expect her to be okay. It'll take months for her wounds to heal. Oh my god. That's so awful. Did cori mention anyone who might have A grudge against her? No, we only met her that one day, And most of that was spent talking About school and the sorority. So, no mention of an old boyfriend, maybe a jealous one? Do you think that's who attacked her? We're just covering all of our bases. Since none of her things were taken, We're wondering if the attack was more personal in nature. Jesus. So someone was targeting her? If you recall anything she might have mentioned, Please reach out. Okay. We should do something. Yes, absolutely. We will. We will make plans to visit as a group and show our support. And tomorrow we'll start putting together a fundraiser To help cover some of Cori's medical expenses. Until then, we're short one sister. I think I know just the girl. - Welcome. - I can't believe it. Believe it, you're a beta delta chi. Coming through. Oh, I see you've met by boyfriend. Bailee, this is kyle. Thank you for helping. No biggie, gets me off my butt And gives me a chance to see my girl. He's hot. I know. What a crazy thing to happen, right? That poor girl. I hope she's okay. She will be. It's just gonna take time. That's good. On the bright side, I guess this was meant to be. I guess so. That's it. I know you're gonna love this house, Samantha. Bailee, welcome, this is Samantha. You two are gonna be rooming together. Yay. So nice to meet you. Bailee is a transfer, just like I was. really? From where? Westervale. My brother goes to westervale. What dorm were you in? I can ask if you know any of his friends. Oh, I wasn't. I actually lived off campus. Well maybe you guys had some classes together. Who were your professors? Oh, I had a whole bunch. Sanderson, Everett, a few more. Okay, I can ask my brother. Maybe you guys met and didn't even know it. Maybe. I didn't get out much will all my classwork, so. Okay then. All right, this is the last. Where do you want it? Oh, I'll take care of that. It's got my fragile stuff in it. Let me show you your room. Getting settled in? Yeah, just finishing up. I have one more thing for you to unpack. What is this? See for yourself. Jana, oh my god. Sorry, did I? No, I, I just didn't expect it so soon. I'm sorry, I just, I guess it just feels like We're already sisters, you know? How do I look? Like a beta delta chi sister, as you should. Come here. I want a photo. Oh, yeah. Okay. Awesome, I can't wait to post these. Let me know if you need anything else. Someone's excited. Sisters of beta delta chi, we gather here tonight As our predecessors have for decades, For the indoctrination of new blood into our family. May the sisters who will guide these three step forward. Do you vow to tend to your underlings as you would Your own flesh and blood siblings and to guide them In the ways of the beta delta chi traditions? I vow. Then let it forever be noted in the registry Of our national sisterhood that these three offerings Are now pledged to become full members Of the beta delta chi family, Once they have fulfilled their initiation. sisters for life! What are you doing? I dropped my skin cream. Why are you messing with my stuff? I'm not, I told you I... Don't lie to me! I just dropped this, that's all. is everything okay? Sorry, just a misunderstanding. Okay. Just wanted to remind you that our proposal is due To the grant review board next week. I know. I'm on it. Dr. Atkins said he's sending his data later today, And I will add it to the reports. Three years of work on phase one. Three days until phase two. It's exciting. I think you mean exhausting. But still, pretty exciting. I will have everything input by Friday. Good. I hope you're not missing too much at the sorority. Oh, no, my sisters are covering for me. They know how important this is. That's good. You know, some of my closest friends Were my sorority sisters. Huh. Kappa delta omega, women of action. Ha. Make sure and double check everything. It has to be perfect. I know. You can count on me. great. Okay. Great. Ooh. Hello? Is someone there? Whoa. Bailee. Oh my gosh. How did you get in here? The janitor. Sorry, I didn't wanna scare you. What are you doing here? I came by to see if you needed anything. And, I brought sandwiches. Okay, I think I love you. What exactly am I looking at here? They're miniature pistol shrimp. They live in symbiosis with the fish. If you separate them at the wrong time, they can both die. So they need each other to survive. Right. The question becomes, when can they be separated And exist as their own entities? I get that, how they need each other. I used to feel the same way. My sister. Oh, you have a sister? A twin, actually. She was born two minutes before me, Which of course she used against me all the time, Claiming she was older, That I should listen to her because of it. Why didn't she come to school with you? Because she's dead. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. It's okay, you didn't kill her. She did it to herself. We were 16. I was there. You mean you found her? No. I saw it happen. I tried, but I couldn't stop her. Oh, Bailee, I'm so sorry... Having a twin, it's like having someone Who's not just your sister or even a best friend. It's like someone who's almost a part of you. When I lost her, I didn't know how I would go on. She was everything to me, my whole world. And, I'll never be close to anyone like that. Till now. That's why joining a sorority was so important to me, Why beta delta chi felt like such a perfect fit. Sisters for life, right? Right. God, I am so sorry for your loss. Thanks. I really have to get back to this data. Okay. Thank you for the food. Okay, I'll sit over there and do some homework. I can keep you company, all night if you want. That's so sweet, but I have this thing. I just get really in my head and... I'll be as quiet as a mouse, I promise. I really need to focus. You should go back, hang out with the others. Okay, sure. When you're done, we should go out and celebrate. Absolutely. Right after I celebrate with kyle. He said he's making special plans. How sweet of him. Thank you again for checking on me. And especially for the food. Of course, what are sisters for? There you are. What time did you get in last night? Around one, I think. Well I hope you and kyle had fun at least. Mm, I wish. I was at the lab, entering data. Ugh, boring. Oh, before I forget, can I please use your laptop To order the shirts for the fundraiser? Mine's down again. Again. I know. I need a new one. I shouldn't have broke up with Evan. That boy was dull, but he had mad skills. With computers. Sure, it's on my desk. Thank you so much, pumpkin. Mm-hm. Bailee, why are you in Jana's closet? I needed a top. She said I could borrow one. Oh, okay. That's Jana's. I know. She told me I could use it to order The fundraising t-shirts. But that's not any of your business. Wow, hot plans tonight? Kyle's taking me out to celebrate. We haven't had a second since I got put On the grant research team. All I have to do is email over the data, And I am good to go. You finished? Congrats. Yeah, you have no idea how happy I am to be done with this. Okay. What? No, no, no. What's wrong? All my data, it's all messed up. Looks like you've got some sort of computer virus. What? No. How does that happen? I don't know, maybe you picked it up online? No. Ari, she borrowed my laptop to order the shirts. I'm screwed. I'm totally screwed. I have to let Dr. Leeman know. Jana, everything okay? Dr. Leeman, I don't know how to say this, But the data's been corrupted. What do you mean, how? I don't know. It was there. I worked on it all last night, and it was there This morning when I checked. I think it's a computer virus. Jana, the deadline is tomorrow morning. If we miss it, we're out of the running for the grant. I know. I'm sorry. Give me a chance to fix it. How? If you stay up all night, it'll still be more Than one person can do. I'll figure it out, somehow. If it's not there by seven am, I'm pulling the plug. It will be. I promise. I am so fired. You have a backup, right? Yeah, on the cloud, but it's not complete. I can't re-create all of that, not by tomorrow. Maybe not alone. I'll help you. I can't ask you to do that. You didn't ask. I offered. Pull up the backup. You start at the top, I'll work up from the bottom, And we could check each other's work. Bailee, that would be a lifesaver. Of course, what are sisters for? thank you so much. I am really sorry. I'll make it up to you, I promise. It's okay, just get it done. And if you need anything, just call me. I will. I love you. I love you too. You're home? I thought you had plans with kyle. I did, until my data got all corrupted, thanks to you. What are you talking about? My computer. You used it, and suddenly it's infected with a virus. Jana, I don't know what you're talking about. Ari, just apologize. Apologize for what? I didn't do anything. All I did was order the shirts. I didn't start anything. then how did it happen? The data was fine before you used this. Jana, I don't know, but I didn't do it, And definitely not on purpose. Whatever. I can't discuss this right now. I'm gonna be up all night fixing what you did. Jana, are you serious? I didn't do this. Fine, I'm out. I don't know how you managed to do this Overnight, but I'm impressed. We cut it really close, Which is not something I enjoy doing. I know, and again, I'm sorry. So, do you still want me to be a part of this? Believe me, I thought about firing you. But what you did, overnight. Taking responsibility and fixing your mistake. Those are great qualities to have in a research partner. Yes, thank you. This is so important to me. It will never happen again, I swear. It better not. Let's try and keep the excitement down To a minimum from now on. I could not agree more. Is everything okay at the house? Yes, it's good. Actually, it's great. It was my little sister that helped me finish this on time. Hm, sisterhood has its rewards, that's for sure. Well, now that we have this behind us, Let's focus on the future. I'll submit this to the committee, And we'll hope for the best. You go, get some rest. Bailee. I had a nightmare. okay. It was about my sister. All right, just Go to sleep, okay? I think you missed a spot. How do you like your rain check? I love it. I just didn't think it'd be quite so literal. Thank you for being so patient. If this is my reward, I'll be as patient as you want me to be. I just hope no one comes in and rains on our parade. We didn't get caught last time. that's true. about that spot you missed. I don't know what she did or what site she visited, But she jeopardized the entire grant. I get it, but it's not like she meant to do it. I know, it's just sometimes she can be so careful. Yeah, but she would never deliberately screw you over. She's been your best friend since what, Your second day at school? Just talk to her about it. Especially now that you've had some time to cool down. Oh, you thought that cooled me down. You're a lot less fun since you took That conflict resolution class. Oh yeah, I'm a total bore now. I'll talk to her. Thank god Bailee was there to help. She totally saved the day. Well she certainly likes to be around you. Yeah, she's my little sister. Does she know that's all she is? Is that jealousy I hear? no, I just think she's a little needy. Well, she did come into my bed this morning. I'm listening. That's it. We slept. And you call me the boring one. All sold out, again. What can I say? I can be persuasive. Okay, this I gotta witness. Sam, is everything okay? You're acting a little quiet. I'm fine. Did something happen with Bailee? You remember how she said she went to westervale? I told my brother about her, and he had never heard Of any of the professors Bailee mentioned. okay. He also said that freshmen aren't Allowed to live off campus, which Bailee said she did. Why would she lie about that? I don't know. Hey, Bailee, Steph asked me to tell you That your transcript from westervale came through smudged. Really? Yeah, probably something with the fax Machine on their end. Can you have them send it in a email? Sure, I'll reach out tomorrow and ask. that'd be great. Thank you. Admin can be such a pain. You said it. Sorry, didn't hear you. That's okay. You do this every night? Yeah, helps me sleep. So what are you looking for? Ketamine. My kinda girl. How much? That much. I'll give you one on the house If you wanna stay and hang. Tempting. But no thanks. Hey, what's going on? I have no idea. She just called an emergency meeting. I just hope it don't take long. Thank y'all for attending. No, this is not about the fall fling dance that's coming up. I've called this emergency meeting because we've discovered That a large portion of the funds that were raised Last week have gone missing. what? I don't think I have to mention how shocked I am by this. And saddened. So in an act of sisterly compassion, I'll offer this one chance. Come clean, right now, and we can put This nastiness behind us. Fine, we'll do it the hard way. I promise, when we find out who the thief is, And we will find out, Your time as a beta delta chi will come to an end. What the hell is going on? what were you doing, girl? What in the world is going on? oh my god, Samantha. - What happened? - I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I just found her here. Samantha, are you okay? somebody call 911. Samantha? And you don't know of any medication she was taking? Anything that could caused a reaction? She was totally fine earlier. Well she's not fine now. So I know you know what's coming. We're gonna have to search the house. Is this yours? It's private stuff. Family photos, some personal things. I'm gonna need you to open it. There's nothing in there. Then opening it shouldn't be an issue. Bailee. It's private. I'm sure it's nothing he hasn't seen before. I can ask to see your search warrant. You could, and I could go get one And come back with the police. Or we can just do this now and cross you off the list. I've never seen that before, I swear. It was in your dresser. Then someone put it there, because it's not mine. We found it with this. Looks to be about 800. Which explains the 1,200 that went missing, Minus what you spent for drugs. Steph, no. I didn't take that money, Nor did I use it to buy drugs. Are you serious? Come on, I've never seen any of that before. Jana, you have to believe me. I just, how did it get there? Legally, I can't arrest you. Good, because it's not mine. But the Dean'll have to be informed, And the police may become involved. Arielle, you need to leave, tonight. Steph, no. I swear, I didn't do this. Pack your stuff. If the drugs in Sam's system don't match, We'll know it wasn't you. It wasn't. We'll see. I'll come back tomorrow for the rest. Call first, so we can make sure That someone's here to keep an eye on you. Steph. I got it. I didn't do it, Jana. Ari. How can you not believe me? You're supposed to be my best friend. We're supposed to be sisters. I want to. But, but how else do you explain this? It was in your room. Jana, there are 25 girls in this house. Anybody could have put that in my room. Oh, and that guy from kappa tri last semester, Did somebody just put him in your room, and his alcohol? No, that was a bad decision, And I took responsibility for that, and I been playing By the house rules ever since, you know I have. Jana, you know me. I do, and I wanna believe you, but. But what? - Who would set you up? - I don't know. But I'm gonna find out. You need to watch your back. You okay? It doesn't make any sense. She's not like that. Some of the other sisters said she'd Gotten into trouble before. Yeah, but, she apologized and stopped. She changed. Maybe she didn't. Sometimes people keep secrets from us. Even people we think are our best friends. I know how hard is to lose someone you're so close to. It's like losing a part of yourself. It's okay. We're all here for you, especially me. Sisters for life. I wanna believe her. It's just, how else did it get there? I know Arielle's had some issues in the past. I mean, breaking rules and wanting to have too much fun, But maybe she's telling the truth. You think someone framed her? Okay, who and why? Any of them seem jealous or mad? No, of course not. What about Bailee? What is your issue with her? I don't have an issue. - Okay. - I do, actually. She's needy. She's constantly with you or following you or texting. Sorry, oh. Making my point for me. Let me guess, she wants to know where you are And when you'll be back? She's sweet. She's just, wounded. She lost her twin sister when she was young, And I think she's just trying to find that connection again. Okay, that sucks. I feel for her. Making her hang out with some of the other sisters For a while might not be the worst thing. With everything that's happened lately, I'm not so sure I can do that. You just proved my point. Talk later. Bye. The tox screen came back positive. They found ketamine in Samantha's system, Which is a match for what we found upstairs. According to Samantha, she didn't take anything. She just made her tea, as she does every night, Which means someone dosed her. No. Who would do that? I was hoping you could tell me. Yeah, that's what I figured. This is now a criminal matter that has to be taken up With the dean and board of directors. What does that mean? It means your sorority's on disciplinary watch. One more violation and you'll lose your charter. I probably shouldn't have to say this, but considering One of your members was assaulted and another drugged, You might wanna keep things on a tighter leash. We will, definitely. I'll see myself out. What does this mean? What about Arielle? Arielle's out, Jana. She caused this. Okay, we don't know that. Steph, wait, let's just... No. As the president, I serve two very important roles In this house, one, to keep the sisters safe, Which apparently I'm currently sucking at, And more importantly, to ensure we retain our charter As beta delta chis. I'm sorry, but unless Arielle has proof otherwise, She's out for good. Jana. Dr. Leeman, hi. Are you okay? Oh yeah, just house trouble. You seem to be dealing with a lotta that lately. I may have some news that might brighten your day. Our grant was accepted. It was? Oh, that's great. And you played a big part in it With all of your hard work. That's why I want you to become A permanent member of my research team. Permanent? Yes, now it entails a semester away, is that okay? Away? The research center in oxford. England? Yes. I'm assuming that's all right. Yes, I have always wanted to go to England. Oh my gosh. Sorry. Is it gonna be okay with whoever that is? Your boyfriend, I'm assuming. No, he's great. It's the little sister I was assigned. Oh, well I hope you won't turn it down because of her. I mean, this type of thing weighs Heavily on graduate schools. No, there is an entire house of sisters for her. She will be just fine. Besides, it's my life. Good, I'm glad you got your priorities in order. Well, I'll be in touch with the arrangements. Thank you so much, really. You have no idea how badly I needed some good news today. Glad I could help. So, I am so proud of you, Jana. I know how hard you've been working for this. Thank you, thank you so much, you guys. and you. Hey, it's gonna be fine. You have all these other sisters here for you. Yeah, I was. What about kyle? I'm sure he's upset. He's not thrilled about being apart, But he knows this is a great opportunity for me. Besides, it's just a semester. He said he'd come visit. Hey, you're gonna be fine here. A semester is nothing when your sisters for life, right? Who's in here? I'm calling the police. Officer carter? Hi, is everything okay? Sorry to bother you. Is Jana here? It's here somewhere, has to be. That's okay. I don't understand. Someone used your keycard to access The campus lab where you work. And they proceeded to trash it. What? - Why would they do that... - eh. I gotta ask. Where were you tonight? I was here. I went up to my room to do homework around nine. so you've been here all night? Yeah. So I can corroborate that with your roommate? She's not here anymore. so... I was there. I came in to ask her something And we studied together for a while. She was here, with me. Okay then. But do me a favor. Come by the security office tomorrow, and we'll put Together some names of who had access to this. Dr. Leeman to hold onto this for a little while. Of course. Good night, ladies. Why did you lie? Why? For you. No, I didn't ask you to do that. Really? So where were you? In my room, just like I said. But with no one to confirm it. No, but I didn't do it. I believe you, but would they? Without an alibi, you can kiss that semester away goodbye. Do you really think Dr. Leeman would want you involved? No. Then what's the problem? The problem is we lied. You didn't do it, right? So you're clear. Honestly, you should be thanking me. I protected you, because that's what sisters do. You're right. It's weird. I mean, why would Bailee lie? I don't know. It wouldn't be my first instinct. But there is another problem. The lie also makes you her alibi. So if you weren't with her last night, where was Bailee? I mean, it wouldn't be hard for her To get a hold of your keycard. But why would she trash the lab? What does that get her? I don't know. Maybe it gets you framed for the break-in So that you don't go away next semester. Or it just makes you need her. Look, all I know is, ever since she's been around, She's been attached to you like, Like some lost puppy. You might wanna get some distance from her. Dr. Leeman. I just, I, I don't know what I'm doing here. It just felt like the right thing to do. I didn't break in to the lab. I mean, why would I? Why would I jeopardize such an amazing opportunity? I know you didn't. You do? Of course, I know you. It's not in your character. But, Jana, someone did, and I think they did it On purpose to lead back to you. Maybe even jeopardize your place on the grant team. I know the sorority system can be tough, but is there An enemy or someone you created? Maybe at another house, dating an ex-boyfriend, Or maybe a pledge you rejected. No. Who has access to your keycard? It was in my bag. So all of the sisters at the house. Are you in a feud with anyone? Does someone wanna make you look bad? My roommate just got kicked out. She was mad that I didn't defend her, But she would never do this. Well someone did. You should think about it. Like we do here, study the behavior And conduct the experiment. That'll lead you to the truth. there you are. I've been texting. Yeah, I know. You didn't text me back. I was waiting to see if you wanted to grab lunch or... I needed some space. You wanna go for a run, or maybe we can... No, I mean I need space alone. Okay. I guess I'll come back later. I'll just bring this up, then I'll go. I was thinking, with Arielle gone, I thought maybe I can move in here, with you. what? Think of how fun it would be. Sisters, sharing the same room. I was gonna talk to Steph about it... Don't. Bailee, you need to stop. We've been spending too much time together lately. I don't understand. Did I do something wrong? No. I just need space, from you. But you're my big sister. Yes, and that's all fine, When we're here at the house Or on campus doing sorority events. But not every day all day. It's just... Not normal. You should spend more time with the other sisters, Especially since I'll be gone next semester. That's why I wanna hang out with you. Because I can now. That's sweet, but I wanna hang out with kyle, Who I've barely got to spend any time with lately, And soon won't be able to. So just, make other plans, okay? I'm not gonna be around for a while. Hi. Listen, I just wanted to apologize about earlier. I just enjoy your company, but I get it. I'll sister up for a while. I made you some tea. Consider it a peace offering. That's sweet, thank you. Jana? Bailee, what the? It's okay. We're sisters. We share everything. No, this is totally... Fun, right? Fun. Where's your sense of adventure? You're a whack job. I'm outta here, Jesus. What are you gonna say? That you just happened to end up in the shower with me? Naked? I'm gonna tell her the truth, and see how she reacts When she finds out you used her phone to bait me here. And you think she's gonna believe you over me? I guess we're about to find out. From what we can tell, He slipped and cracked his head on the tile. That's what caused the concussion. Thankfully, the water was running all night, Which kept him from becoming hypothermic. is he gonna wake up? We've induced a medical coma To help us get the swelling down. He's young, strong. We're hopeful he makes a full recovery. But you don't know? We'll do everything we can. Like I said, he's very strong. He'll be okay. Arielle, and now this. We're here for you, always. Sisters for life. This is my fault. Stop that, this is not your fault. Yes, it is. If I had kept our plans, he wouldn't have been there And this never would have happened. I don't know what happened. I just passed out. You've been under so much stress lately. Your body needed rest. The doctor said they needed some Of kyle's family information, just in case. Come on, let's go take care of that and come right back. Are you coming? I'll stay here, keep an eye on him, case he wakes up. Thank you. God what a waste of fine man meat. Can you believe this? How awful. I'll be back later. You just stay right there. No waking up. - Mrs. Mendel. - hi. These are my beta delta chi sisters. This is Cori's mom. How's she doing? She's better, thank god. She comes to, now and then. How much does she remember? Some, not everything. They're not sure yet if it's trauma or damage. I'm gonna say hi. I am so sorry. I saw the security footage. It's hard to believe, actually. you. Hi, you're awake. I remember you, your face. I'm Bailee. We met at the beta delta chi house during pledge week. Looks like we'll be sisters as soon as you're outta here. I'm sorry. Are you sure we didn't meet somewhere else? Maybe on campus, probably had a class together. Yeah, that's probably it. Sorry, my memory's not all back yet. I hate to ask something so frivolous, but Do you know if anyone has found Cori's pendant yet? Her pendant? Her sorority pendant. Actually, it was mine, from my days in beta delta chi. Right, she showed it to us When she came to rush the house. She was very proud. She swore she had it on the night of the attack. We haven't been able to find it. It's only real value is sentimental, to both of us. Of course. Seems like you're healing pretty nicely. Do you remember anything about the person who attacked you? It all happened so fast, out of nowhere. I just remember how angry they were, The rage that they attacked me with. I just don't understand why. I'm sure it was very scary. did cori remember anything about the person Who attacked her? No, not yet. She recalls flashes, glimpses. So she didn't see his face? Oh. It wasn't a him. What? She remembers they were wearing perfume, Definitely feminine. She has always had a finely tuned nose. Right, she mentioned that. Try not to think too much about why. Sometimes life is just random like that. You get better, and you can put all this behind you. The other sisters and I are behind you 100%. Thank you, girls. Thank you. I can't believe this is happening. And on the night of the dance. Jana, where are you going? I just, I have to do some stuff for kyle. I'll come with you. No, thank you. I want some quiet. - I won't say anything... - Bailee, not now. I need some space. Alone, by myself. Okay, sorry. Hey, she'll be okay. Just give her some time. Jana. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I heard about kyle, so I just wanted To check on you, make sure that you were okay. If there's anything that I can do, just let me know. You just being here means so much. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. It's okay, I get it. You didn't know. You didn't know. No, everything's gone wrong all of a sudden. It's like, it's like my whole world has gone crazy. Believe me, you're not crazy. It's Bailee. I did some digging on our friend And come to find out she's done this before, Jana. You just have to come over here right now. We have to go to the library, okay? - Okay? - Okay. This is the place. What are we doing here? We do not go to school here. No, but Bailee did, before she came to us. Here? She said she went to westervale. Jana, she lied. Where are we going? We're almost there. Is anyone even down here? No. Violet, there you are. So you're the new Lynn? Who? Lynn was my sister. She enrolled here last year and she got Paired with a roommate, Bailee Adams. They got along great at first. Bailee seemed sweet, but soon she wanted to be With Lynn all the time, like every second. She switched her schedule so that they had All the same classes, befriended the same people. Lynn couldn't get a minute to herself. I came to visit one weekend, and I couldn't get five minutes Alone with my sister the whole time. Bailee was always there. Gee, wonder how that feels. It was like she was forcing me out. Like she was Lynn's sister. At the time we thought it was sort of sweet, Especially after learning about Bailee's twin sister, But now, I should have known something was wrong. Bailee was overly helpful, especially when Lynn's Class assignments started to go awry, Which was completely out of the norm for her. She was an a student. Responsible. sound familiar? The grant data. I told you I didn't tamper with it. Lynn and I used to talk or text every day. And that tapered off, and then it stopped completely. Look, I get it. College keeps you busy. But it wasn't just me. My parents, her boyfriend, It felt like all of us were being pushed away. When Christmas break hit, Lynn came home And Bailee came with her. That's weird. No kidding. Lynn was like a totally different person. Quiet. Withdrawn. I didn't realize it then, but I think she was scared. Bailee included herself in everything. Every Christmas, we would do this ugly sweater Photo of the family. It was silly, but my mom loved doing it. Bailee crashed it. That's weird. After the break, they went back to school. My sister texted me one night and said She was transferring but didn't want Bailee to know. She called me really late one night. When I called her back, she didn't answer. We never heard from her again. My god, I am so sorry. They found Lynn in the dorm boiler room. They said she'd done it herself, But I know she'd never do that. Didn't the school look into it? Yeah, they questioned her roommate. Bailee. She was the last person to see my sister alive. I think she found out Lynn was transferring and stopped her. You think she's capable of that? I think when Bailee feels she's about to lose Something she wants, she's capable of anything. You should come back to my place, stay the night. You cannot go back to the house. I have to. If Bailee starts to think that we're on to her, She'll get rid of any evidence. Then we should go to the police. And tell them what? That my sorority sister is hopelessly devoted to me? We need proof. Something tangible that links Bailee to all of this. Samantha, Lynn, cori. Even kyle. You need to be careful. You heard what she did to violet's sister. I will be. And I'll call as soon as I find anything. If I don't hear from you, I'm coming to find you. Let's go. Where you gonna start? I think I know where to look. Hey, is somebody there? Hey. Hi, violet. Bailee. I'm so glad you remember me. I know, it's been a while. What are you doing here? I saw you talking to some of my friends. What did you tell them? Nothing. They needed a book. A book? Really? Somehow, I don't believe you. Say hi to your sister for me. Hey, how you doing? Hanging in. Is Bailee home? No, we went our separate ways at the hospital Right after you left. She said she had school stuff. Thanks. There you are. Did you get everything done? Yep, had to take care of something at the library. Jana was looking for you. Jana's here? Yeah, she got back a few minutes ago. She's upstairs. You shouldn't touch other people's stuff. Oh. Ari, I'm... Ari can't talk right now. She and I are having a little sisterly One-on-one time upstairs. Bailee. Jana, I'm talking. Don't be rude. Come upstairs to the initiation room, And we can work this all out. And in case you were thinking of calling anyone. Jana? Jana? We'll be waiting. Bai... Jana, what are you doing? You need to run. No. No no. Jana, you need to get outta here. Jana, what are you doing? No, no no Thanks for coming. I knew you would. It's what makes you such a great sister. Bailee, what are you, what are you doing? Before we get into all that, hand it over. Hand what over? Whatever you got from the kitchen, a knife probably. I didn't... please don't make me ask again. I won't be so polite, and it'll be a lot messier. Okay. Okay. Now we can talk. This is nice, just the three of us. The house is so different when it's quiet. Not for long, they'll be back any minute. No they won't. The fall fling dance, remember? I told them I'd stay behind for you. You needed the emotional support. What a day you've had. Bailee, you need to stop this. Of course I will. What, you're just gonna kill Ari? No, silly, you are. What? I know we'll never be blood related, But we can be related in blood. Hers. That's why we're doing this here. I know how sacred this is to our sisterhood. This will bond us forever. No. It's the only way I'll ever trust you again. We'll make it look like a suicide, I promise. Like you did with your sister? She wanted to leave. To have her own life, her own friends? That's not what sisters do. They're there for each other always, especially twins. Then you did the same thing to Lynn when you found out That she was transferring to another school. And how many more in between that? You know I won't. You will. Or it's her and you, both found here together. Who would believe it? After everything that's happened? You discovering your best friend sabotaged your grant. Then losing her as a friend. then kyle? Just all became too much. You were so distraught. Poor kyle, stuck in that bed, unconscious, Unable to defend himself. But if you make the right choice, We can be sisters forever. You're crazy. Why? Because I want a sister? Someone who loves me no matter what And will always be there for me? How is that crazy? You need to do this, for us. We'll each do a wrist. Okay. On second thought, let's wait till the drugs kick in. Drugs, what drugs? I drugged you, obviously, Just in case she wouldn't go through with it. It should take effect any minute. Bailee. Relax. The increased heart rate will just spread them Through her body faster. Jana. Looks like she's out. Bailee! Bailee, you're a terrible sister. Bailee. Bailee. How about a taste of your own medicine? Don't. You're the meanest sister I've ever had. You're welcome. baby, you're awake. Jana. Hey, it's all over. Bailee can't hurt us anymore. How you feeling? Are you okay? It's perfect, thank you. You treat me so well. We're gonna get along just great. We're gonna be just like sisters.
