(light heavenly tone) (gentle upbeat music) (Toni giggles) - [Dispatcher] 37th Street, the Bridges Tire Shop, cover the Northeast yard motion. 112, domestic disturbance at 3450 Lola Vista. - Mullins again? - [Dispatcher] That's right. - I'm on my way. - [Dispatcher] Heller's your backup. (sirens wailing) (child crying) - Lucky he's okay. It's okay, really, it's okay. Look what he did to me. - Mrs. Mullins, calm down, you need to calm down. - I want him out of here. - We're gonna press charges this time? - [Mrs. Mullins] This time I will. - Okay, all right. What I need you to do is wait to do- - He's gone crazy. - Is wait over by the side of the road. - He's drunk, he was breakin' up the whole house. Please help me, please make sure you get him, please get him. - [Heller] Dispatch, this is Baker 220, we're gonna need an ambulance out here at 3450 Lola Vista Avenue. Minor injuries on a possible assault victim. (suspenseful music) - [Toni] Mr. Mullins? Mr. Mullins, this is the police, come on out. - Stroud's goin' in now, do you copy? - Mr. Mullins, did you hear me? - 10-4 dispatch. - [Dispatcher] Copy that, Heller. - Stay clear of the house, all right? (suspenseful music continues) (wood thumps) - Mr. Mullins, step out slowly with your hands in the air. Mr. Mullins! Freeze! Freeze! Drop the pipe, drop the pipe! (pipe clatters) Hands behind your head, hands behind your head! All right, up against the wall. Up against the wall, feet apart. Give me those hands. - Oh, we havin' fun yet, huh? - Nice backup, Heller. - You want him to give you some trouble? (Mr. Mullins screams) - What the hell do you think you're doing? - Would you relax, I know this guy, he likes to hit people. You mother- - You hit him again, Heller, and it goes in my report. - Yeah? You do that and you'll never see backup again from anybody. - Get your hands off of him. Get your hands off of him! - Fine, fine, it's your call. - Come on, Mr. Mullins. - Listen, do you want me to run him in for ya? - Hi, smile. Hey, bright eyes, how'd your shift go? - Hey, long. It must of been a full moon last night, seemed like all the wacko's were out. - Hopefully they'll get back in their cages before I have to get out there and make our streets safe against parking violators. - I gotta get this stuff in and get outta here. I'll see ya at breakfast? - Oh yeah. - Okay, see ya later. - Chili omelet? - Extra onions. Hey, get decent, I'm comin' through. You know, you think they'd spend some extra money for another locker room so I wouldn't have to go through this everyday. - And miss the beef cake? - You don't hold a candle to my boyfriend, Charlie. - I don't know about that. - Two days wear, (sniffs) five days wear. Oh man, last years softball play-offs! - Oh, you're a sick man, Weisberg. - Here, burn 'em with you're done with 'em. - Thanks, Charlie. How do you get 'em like that? - Did you guys see the set on that blond that Hank was with the other night at the bowling alley? - Oh man, she must have been a lot of fun in the shower, huh? - Well, you know what they say, the bigger the breasts, the dumber the guy. (men laugh) - Stroud? - Huh? - Lieutenant Feuer wants to see you in his office. - Uh-oh! It's all over now. - Another one bites the dust. Can I have your locker? (laughs) - Sir? - Come in, Stroud. I've marked you meet standards in all but three categories. In those; amount of work performed, coordinating with others and helpful to fellow employees, I have rated you exceed standards. - Thank you, sir. - Well, Stroud, two more months, it's coming down to the wire, this will be your last evaluation. - I thought I had one more at the end of review? - I think we can skip it, unless, of course, you object? - Oh, no sir, I don't object at all. - When the time comes, I'll just attach this eval to my recommendation. Here, read and sign. - Thank you so much Lieutenant Feuer. - By the way, Heller told me how well you handled the Mullins situation, keep up the good work. - Thank you, sir. - Toni, I hear you might interested in an administrative service position when the time comes. - Yeah, definitely. - Stop by my office some time, I'll fill you in on the requirements. - Well thank you, Captain Daley, I appreciate that. - No really, you look fabulous today, I don't know what it is. - What do you want? - [Weisberg] Hey, Toni! What was up with Feuer? - Evaluation update, straight A's as usual. - All right! I told you she was a keeper! - That's crazy, mazel tov! - Well done. - A toast, huh? To officer Stroud, the best. - To women in uniform. - Yeah why not, hey, why not. - Got anything for me? - Stop. - [Charlie] Another bloody Mary, keep 'em comin' will ya? - Oh, gee Charlie, if you paid a tab or left a tip, the service might be more to your liking. What're you tryin' for, a personal best? It's not even nine a.m. - She loves me, she loves me. - You're a prize. Oh god! Please, no, no, no, ref! - Hey. - [Toni] Hey. How was your day? - I survived. How was yours? - My day went very well, I got a great evaluation. - Well, congratulations. - Thank you. - It smells good in here, what're you making? - Chicken. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - You don't smell too bad yourself. - Well, I may be available after dinner. - Yeah? I'll make sure I keep it open. (both giggle) I got a little present for ya. - Hey, you found it. - Yeah, I did. - Where did you find this? - Well, you know I got my sources. You're welcome. - Thank you so much. Do you wanna grab the salad? - Got it. You want a drumstick and a wing? - Oh yeah, that's good. - Anything come in the mail? - No. - It's all right. - Oh honey, it's early, you still have time. - I dunno, I just, I'm startin' to feel like I'm gonna be a high school teacher the rest of my life. - College, high school, what's the difference? It's the same smart ass kids, only older. - You know, Toni, I really wish you'd take this a little more seriously. - Dean, I was kidding. - I mean, you really take bein' a cop seriously, don't you? - Let's not have this argument again, okay? Let's just enjoy the evening, all right? - Yeah, okay. - Okay. - Here, give your plate. - Thanks. How you doin'? Hey, Charlie. (car tires squeal) Hey, what's up with Charlie? Is he in some kind of trouble or somethin'? Well? - His wife called the department about his drinking. - Ouch. - [Weisberg] Ouch is right, it was a lousy thing to do. - What's gonna happen to him? - I dunno, probably make him go get counseling. You know Charlie, he's gonna love that! - Yeah well he has been hittin' it pretty hard lately. - Yeah, well, that's none of our business. - Yes it is. We count on him for backup in the field, if he's got a problem, we should help him. - Charlie's a big boy, he can take care of himself. That's not the point anyway, his wife shouldn't of reported him to the brass, they should've worked it out in private. - Maybe she tried. - I don't care if she tried, what she did was wrong. Look, Toni, people are always trying to take us down and havin' your wife rat on ya, it's about as low as it gets. I mean, I'd never rat on your about anything, I know you wouldn't rat on me, right? That's the code. It shouldn't happen, she knows better. - [Toni] Ah, I almost burnt my finger. - Oh, here, use this, don't get that in the car. - Hey, does anyone wanna go to the football game this weekend? Dean and I have a couple extra tickets. - I wouldn't pay to watch those bums. - I'll go if that blond from the bowling alley will come with me. - Oh come on Charlie, it's not that bad, your wife's just worried about you. - She's got a hell of a way of showin' it. - She'll get over it, man. - Yeah, why don't you send her some flowers? - Yeah, maybe I'll send her wreath. - How 'bout one of those sexy teddies? Woman love that crap, right Ton? - No, men love that crap. (children laughing) - [Child] Amanda, you're doing good! (doorbell rings) - [Charlie] Toni. - Charlie, what're you doing here? - Well I hate to do this to ya but I need a little favor, I was wondering if many I could crash here for a couple hours? - Why, what's the problem? - Pam threw me out. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. - Well, I'm not. Maybe after tonight's shift, I think I'm gonna start lookin' for my own place. - Well, come on in. - Yeah? That's all right? - Yeah, come on. I hope the couch is okay. - Oh, that's great, that's great. Go on, go back to sleep. - Here's a blanket. - Where's Dean? - Oh, he teaches today. - I really appreciate this, Toni. - Yeah, no problem. Here you go. Sleep well. (solemn music) (suspenseful music) Charlie! Charlie, what're you doing? - It's okay. - Charlie! - Just relax. - Charlie! Get off! No, no! Ow! Please, please don't do this. Stop! Charlie, don't! Get off! Get off! (children laughing) (solemn music) (Toni sobbing) (phone rings) Hello? - [Dean] Hey, it's me. Guess what, I got great news. Georgia offered me the professorship, I start in the fall. Hello? Toni, hello? Did you hear me? - I can't talk right now, Dean. (Toni sobbing) - "I can't talk right now, Dean, I'm sorry?" - Please, Dean, not now. - "Not now?" What the hell's the matter with you? I called you with the best news of my life and you hung up on me. I think you're supposed to be happy for me here, Toni! Jeez, I don't understand you. You know, if this is about us moving, you knew all along it was a possibility, Toni. If this is about your job, which of course we know is much more important than mine, well, I got news for ya, news flash! They have cops in Georgia too. Toni? (solemn music) (woman laughing) - Somebody's watching. - Be right back. Hey, Toni. So what're you doing here? Listen, do me a favor, will ya? You didn't see me here. I mean, this kinda thing wouldn't go over really big with the wife, you know? - Yeah. - Thanks. I'll cover for you sometime, okay? (solemn music) - [Charlie] Hey. - Hey, those'll kill ya. - You didn't happen to see Toni, did ya? Don't think she's ever been late. - Heard she called in sick. - Hey, Toni? Wake up, it's three o'clock, you've been sleeping for 18 hours. Are you sick? You want me to call a doctor? - No. I told you, I'm okay. - Your mother called, she said she wants to stop by after work. - What for? - Because she wants to see how you are, that's what for. Toni, listen to me, we're gonna have to deal with this sooner or later. This job means a lot to me, I'm not gonna turn it down. Well, I'm glad we had this little talk, I feel so much better. (doorbell rings) - Hey, mom. - Hello, what's the matter? I heard you weren't feeling well. - No, I'm just tired. - Well you don't have a fever. - Mom, I'm okay. - Well you look pale. Jack, she looks awfully pale. - It's that night shift she's workin', when are they gonna put ya on days? - I like the night shift, it's not a problem. - Good, maybe I can get a cup of coffee to go with these cookies? - I'll help. Dean told me about the job offer from Georgia. He's very excited about it. - Yeah, I know. - Well he thinks you're upset because you don't wanna leave town. I don't mean to interfere, you don't have to explain anything to me, it's one thing to talk about moving and it's another to do it, especially now with your wonderful job. - Mom, I.. - What, what? What is it? - How's that coffee comin'? - Oh, it's right here, daddy. Those cookies look great. - Hey Toni, how you doin'? (suspenseful music) - This is Stroud reporting an abandoned vehicle at 7th Park Street. - Need any help? Well aren't we a little jumpy tonight. - What're you doing here? - Hey, I just came to check ya out, see how ya doin'. It gets a little lonely out here at night, you never know what's gonna happen. - Nothin's gonna happen. - Maybe, maybe not. But, you gotta be careful when you're all out here by your lonesome without any backup. - What, is that a threat? - Hey, come on, chill out, Toni, chill out. I'm just tryna be my usual helpful self. Night. - You stay the hell away from me, Charlie! - We need to talk, Toni. - Dean, it's been a long shift and I just wanna finish this up and go to bed. - Yeah, well see that's all you've been doin' lately is working and sleeping. I don't think we've said a dozen words to each other in the past two weeks and god forbid I try to touch you. - I said I don't wanna talk about this. - Yeah, well I do, I wanna talk about this now. - Well since when is everything about you, huh? When did you become the center of the universe? - Look, Toni- - Don't. - Let's not do- - Don't touch me. - My god, Toni, what is wrong with you? It's like I don't even know who you are. - I am the same person I've always been. - No Toni, you're not, somethings changed and I don't know if it's me or if it's Georgia or if it's this crazy job of yours. - You know what, I've about had it with you and your snide remarks about my job, all right? And if you were so unhappy here, I don't see anyone holding you here against your will. - Oh, so what're you suggesting now, Toni, huh? You want me to leave? - Do what you want, Dean, all right? I just need some time alone, okay? - Yeah, well you got it. In fact, why don't you take the rest of your life. - Well, we've been drifting apart lately anyway. - People change. - Our biggest fight was about my being a cop, he just didn't understand that, kept tellin' me I was too smart to be cop, like that was a compliment or somethin'. Stace- - [Stacey] Oh no, it's the goon squad. - Hello, ladies. Pour 'em quick darlin' before I die of first. Hey, nice bulge. - Just because we had one bad evening together doesn't mean you can eat my food. - You want a second chance, I know you're crazy about me. - Hey, listen you guys, I got myself a new place. - All right. - Havin' a little house warmin' party on Sunday, who's comin'? - I'm in. - [Stacey] Don't you think you oughta wait 'til the ink is dry, pal? - Hey, I'm back on the market, sweetheart. - [Weisberg] The markets changed, Charlie. - [Charlie] Oh yeah? - [Weisberg] Changed a lot. - I don't think Charlie's gonna have a problem. - [Weisberg] He's a man who knows the man. - So you comin' to my party, Stace? - Only if I don't have to sit anywhere near him. - Weisberg, you comin'? - Only if Stacey goes. - How bout you, Toni, you comin'? Maybe come a little early, maybe help me set up, you know, make it your place, give it the nice homey touch. - What the hell got in to her? - I don't know. - Not that it's any of your business but her and Dean split up yesterday. - Another cop relationship bites the dust. - Thank you Mr. Sensitivity. - What, it was a joke! It was a joke! Stace, come on. - Heller, will you gimme the plate. - Before the rumors start flying, we wanna let you know what's happening. A young woman in the community has accused Charlie Lloyd of rape. - [Man] What? - Now it is just an allegation, no charges have been filed, Charlie's still a member of this department, one of our own. He'll be on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation and he's still welcome here. - What's the girls name? - I'm really not at liberty to discuss that. All right everyone, I'd like to introduce Detective Bob Hymes from the DA's office, he's going to conducting a joint investigation with the department. Now, Bob's gonna wanna talk to most of you and I expect your full cooperation. - This is unpleasant business for us all, I'm a cop myself so I know how it feels to be questioned by a police officer, so I will try to make this as painless as possible but still try to do my job. If anybody here has any information about the matter at hand, I would appreciate you comin' forward. - Bob will be working with Lieutenant Feuer. Let's make sure and show Charlie our support, we're still a family here. That's it, back to work. - That's a croc, I say it's that slut works at the bakery or Ralph Lauren. - Hey, hey, hey, Toni, what's the rush? What's wrong? - Everybody on Charlie's shift, Detective Hymes wants to see you first, I got the sign up sheet. - I feel so responsible and if I would've come forward earlier, this might not of happened. - [Captain Daley] Who else have you told? - No one. - [Captain Daley] You haven't told anyone here? - No. - Not even Stacey? - Mm-mm, I didn't wanna say anything because I didn't want to guys to find out and plus I'm still under review. - How long have you got? - Three weeks. I feel so bad about that girl. - Toni, listen to me, this is not your fault, you did fine. I'll take care of things from here on out, okay? - Okay. What about Hymes? He's gonna wanna question me. - Don't worry about Hymes for now, let me have a word with the chief. - Okay. - [Captain Daley] I'll straighten things out and then I'll get back to you. - Thank you, Captain. - It'll be all right. (suspenseful music) - All right. - I'll see you in a few minutes. - Okay. - Office Stroud. You know it's been a week, I'm beginning to think that you're dodging me on purpose. - No, sir, I'll get in there as soon as I can. - Well don't we just say that you'll see me before your next shift, okay? - Yes, sir. - Okay. - Excuse me, Captain Daley? - Not now, Toni. (solemn music) - Toni, can I see you a sec? - [Toni] Yeah? - I heard that you took a theft report down at the bakery? - Yeah, I did. - Do you know Anne Davis works there? - Anne Davis, I don't know who that is. - She's the woman that claims that Charlie raped her. - So? - So? Redo the report, put Anne Davis down as a suspect. - On what grounds? She's one of nine employees, I don't have any evidence against her. - Find some, come on. - Excuse me, is the owner around? - No, what can I do for ya? - Are you Anne Davis? - Yes, this is about the theft, isn't it? - Oh, yeah, I just have to follow up on a couple of things. - Mr. Shunwai won't be back till four. - I'm sorry. - About what? - About Charlie Lloyd. (solemn music) It shouldn't of happened and I'm really sorry. If only I had done something, anything. - Now what could you have done that would have been different? - Well I could have come forward when Charlie first attacked me instead of worrying so much about my job and what people were gonna say. - Toni, you gotta stop beating yourself up about this, you can't- - Stace, if you could've seen this poor girls face today, I didn't even know what to say to her and Heller, he wants me to alter my report and make her look like a thief. - [Stacey] You're not gonna do that? - [Toni] No. - Well why do you have to answer to Heller anyway? - I don't, I'm afraid I made a mistake trusting Captain Daley. - Daley? - Yeah. You know, he hasn't said one thing to me since I told him about the rape and Hymes is really pressuring me for a statement. - I don't know. Toni, I think that you have to talk to Hymes. - Stace, everybody is backing Charlie up, all the guys are. - Welcome to the boys club. Listen to me, they have to believe you, first off because you are telling the truth and second off, 'cause in case you forgot, you're a cop too. - Yeah, that's just it, I did forget and someone else got hurt. - There's no way that you could've known he was gonna do that again. - That's my job, my job is to know. (phone ringing) Hello? - Toni, hey, it's Charlie. Hey, how come you didn't show up at kennel with the boys, huh? We had a good time, I missed ya. - How dare you! - [Charlie] You know that we're good pals, Toni. Now, don't go shoutin' me out now, you know? People are gonna start to wonder. - Get it done right now. - [Officer] Yeah, I will. - Excuse me, chief? - What is it Stroud, I'm running late. - Well I've been waiting to hear from Captain Daley, he said he was gonna talk to you about how the department wants to handle this thing with Charlie. - There's a chain of command here Stroud, Daley told you to wait, you wait. - But, sir. Detective Hymes wants to question me and I don't know how much longer I can avoid him. - Well, I'm sorry, I can't help ya. - Stroud! - Yes, sir? - Your daily logs are passed due. - I put them on your desk this morning. - I'm talking about last weeks, you did them on the wrong forms, do them over. - We only switched forms yest- - Just do them, Stroud! - Yes, sir. Hey Betsy, is Captain Daley around? - No, I haven't seen him but have you heard the latest? - [Toni] What? - The media coverage on Charlie is stirin' up things, three more women have filed complaints. - For rape? - Two rapes, one sexual assault. Looks like Charlie's been a busy boy. - Is Hymes around? - You just missed him. (solemn music) - Saturday the 12th, the night of the alleged rape. Let's see, I do believe that officer Charlie Lloyd and I were bowling that night, in fact I'm sure of it. Weisberg, you were there, as I recall, you bowled an outstanding 199. - Hey Toni, do you hear the latest? - [Toni] Yeah, I heard. - That's four now. You gotta wonder if there's more. - Well if there are, we'll just have to deal with them, won't we. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means we're gonna take care of Charlie, that's what that means. You know, Toni, he's been askin' about you, he needs our help. Toni, I think that it would be a good idea to have a female officer by his side, you know, showing her support. - Yeah, right. - [Weisberg] Come on, let's go. (gentle upbeat music) - [Dispatcher] 1-12, return to station, report to Lieutenant Feuer. - 1-12 responding. You wanted to see me, sir? - That's right, I did, Stroud. Where are your logs? - I've been on patrol, sir. - I wanted them before you left. - But I. - Turn around. Turn around. Your shirt is all wrinkled. - Well I've been sitting in a car all night. - I don't wanna hear your excuses, Stroud, just get me those logs. - What about my shift? - Now. - How you doin'? - Urgh, tired. - Here, I'll take these for you. - Thanks. - Man, what a night. Hey, Stace. - Heya, Toni. - Hey. - Stroud? Come with me. - I'm sorry, you didn't make it. - What do you mean? - It's all detailed in your performance evaluation. (solemn music) - What is this? What happened to the evaluation that you did two months ago? When everything was so good you said I wouldn't have to do another. - We need you to sign it. - I won't sign it! This is wrong, I won't sign it! - All right, signature refused. - Why are you doing this to me? - [Feuer] I need your badge and your weapon. - I don't deserve this and you know it. - Toni, what's up? - I got fired. - What? - Betsy, what's goin' on? - She said they fired her. - What're you talkin' about? - Toni, I can't believe they did this to you, it isn't right! - Well apparently right has nothing to do with it, Stace! I didn't play by the rules, you know? I ignored the blue wall of silence and that is why they're getting rid of me. Well I'll tell ya somethin', it's not gonna be that easy. - Her name is Charlene McCrosky, M-C-C-O-R-S-K-Y, she runs a flower shop on Kennedy Street. Seems Charlie asked her out, they did some drinkin', got back to her house and Charlie wouldn't take no for an answer. - Thanks. Who else? - Ingrid Curtis, C-U-R-T-I-S. This happened back in '92. - '92? - Seems her car broke down, Charlie offered her a ride home, he took a little detour, she says he raped her in the backseat. - That's almost two years ago, why did she wait so long to come forward? - Who was she gonna go to, cops? - Anyone else? - Lily Davenport, D-A-V-E-N-P-O-R-T, she's an ex-friend of Charlie's and his wife. I don't know the whole story on this one but apparently it happened during a party at their house last year. - '93. - [Hymes] Mm-hmm. (buzzer sounds) - Yes, Helen? There's a Miss Stroud to see you about Charlie Lloyd. - Oh, that's the female cop I've been trying to interview, they work the same shift. - Yes, please send her in, Helen. - Toni, glad you could make it. This is Pete Maresca, the assistant DA. - Charlie Lloyd raped me. - No, it's all right Toni, I understand that but specifically, who did you speak to in the department? - [Toni] Captain Daley. - Did you tell him exactly what you told us here today? - [Toni] Yes, I did. - And what did he say? - He said he would figure out the best way to handle the situation and get back to me but I never heard from him again. - [Hymes] Did you try talking to the chief? - Yes, I tried but he wouldn't talk to me either, he made me feel like I was the one that committed the crime. - [Maresca] Did he say why he wouldn't speak to you? - [Toni] No. - I'm down here investigating every day, knowing that there are more victims and trying my best to find out who those victims are and low and behold, there's one right here on the force and you knew about it. Well? - Well what? - Well I'm sure that you're well aware that withholding evidence is a serious felony. - Whoa, you're way outta line, Hymes. - I'm outta line? Charlie Lloyd is on paid administrative leave, Toni Stroud gets fired and you have the gal to sit there and tell me that I am outta line! - You don't know Toni Stroud the way we know Toni Stroud. - She wasn't cutting it Hymes, ask any of the men she works with, the woman was on her way out. - And she knew it, that's why she grabbed her chance when she saw it. - What chance? - Anne Davis, the girl at the bakery. When she filed her complaint against Charlie, Toni jumped on the band wagon. - It was her way of putting us on notice. It was Stroud's way of saying "You fire me, there'll be hell to pay." - How can they say that? What about the evaluation that the Lieutenant Feuer gave me where he marked excellent and outstanding? - That's not what they're saying now. - Well he's lying. - It's the code, Toni, they're enforcing the code. (phone rings) - Hello? - [Charlie] You better be real careful out there, Toni, accidents happen. - Honey, I am so sorry. I just wish you'd told me when it happened. - I know. I wanted to but I couldn't, I was so embarrassed and then when all those women starting coming forward, I felt like I was responsible. - No, he's to blame, not you. - Yeah and I'm the one they fired. Mom, I gotta warn ya, everybody in town is gonna know about this. - I don't care about them, my only concern is you. - I know. - A total of five women have come forward now, including the unidentified female officer. - [News Reporter] Thank you, Bob. - Do you think they fired her because of Charlie? - Yeah, embarrassing. You know, I never did trust her anyway. - Gimme a break, Heller. Come on, you know she's a good cop. - If she cared that much about the department, she wouldn't do this. - What're you sayin', man? He raped her. - That's not the way Charlie tells it. - Hey Jack, how you doin'? - Hey Stacey. - Hey Stace. We'll see you guys later, okay? - [Jack] Okay, see ya at home. - Don't work too hard. It's getting really weird, they had a meeting yesterday and they told everybody not to talk to anyone outside of the department. - Yeah, Hymes said that this would happen, he said they were really gonna come down on me. - I hate this, it makes me so angry! I mean, Charlie's facing four felony counts and you're the one they crucify. - [Toni] Hey, where's Betsy, I thought that she was comin'? - Well, you know how it is. - [Toni] Well, maybe you shouldn't be here either. - What're they gonna do, take away my ticket book? (both giggle) - [Toni] I have to find a job, Stace. - [Stacey] Well, how about parking enforcement? You too, 40 days, you can have all this. - [Toni] You can have this too. - Sorry, we tried to reach you to cancel but you already left. - Well I don't mind waiting, I've come a long way for this interview. - But the captain might not be back till nightfall. - And I shouldn't bother rescheduling, right? (care tires squeal) - Sorry, didn't see ya there. - [Toni] Get lost! - Hey! You know, some of our old friends are getting very angry, if I were you, I'd watch it, things happen! (car tires squeal) (knock at door) - Who's there? - Toni, it's me, Dean. Hi. - [Toni] Hi. - I'm so sorry. Why didn't you tell me? - I don't know, I guess I thought that I could handle it on my own. I thought that not telling anyone was the right decision, who knew that'd it'd turn out to be the worst decision of my life. - So, when's the trial? - Couple of months. - What're you doing in the meantime? - Oh, just working in my fathers store. - You know, if you want. Can I do anything for ya? - No, I'm fine. - You're sure about that? - Oh, yeah, absolutely. None of my friends are talkin' to me except for Stacey, she's been great, oh and Heller, who took time out from his very busy schedule to threaten me. Let's see, what else? I'm broke, there isn't a police department that will hire me in the country but other than that, I am just fine. So I hear you're off the Georgia pretty soon? - Yeah, yeah, semester, I gotta get ready. - I really hope that works out for you. - Thanks. (solemn music) Toni, I wish there was somethin' I could- - You know, if you write, I'll write you back. - Take care of yourself. (suspenseful music) (glass smashes) (car tires squeal) (care tires squeal) (car tires screech) (suspenseful music) - [Maresca] One man got out of the car? - Yes. - [Maresca] Did he say anything? - No. - [Maresca] And you can't identify him? - It was too dark, I couldn't see. - We can assign an officer to protect you, Toni. - Oh, come on, do you really think there's a cop in this town who cares about my safety? - Where did you stay last night, Toni? - At my parents. - Good, you should stay there, I don't want you to be alone. - For how long, huh? Until the trial? For the rest of my life, what? - We know you've been through a lot, Toni. - Somebody tried to kill me last night, I don't think that this is worth it anymore. - What happened to your thirst for justice? - I didn't think it was gonna be this difficult. - Yes you did. That's why you didn't report the rape when it happened in the first place and if you quit now, they win hands down. - Do you really think we stand a chance? - Yes, I do and frankly, I always do. This ones not my call, it's yours. Hold on, Bob. Toni? Wait up, Toni. Hey. I forgot to give you something. - What's this? - A civil litigator, a good friend of mine, I told him about you and he thinks he might be able to make a good case for wrongful termination. - Really? - Yeah, see you were never advised that you were not meeting department standards and you never given any formal warning, that could lead to a substantial settlement. But don't take my word for it, give him a call. - It's not about the money, I don't care about the money, it's about what they did to me. - I'm on your side, kid, just tryna help ya nail the bad guys. - Funny, that sounds like what I used to do. Lemme think about it. - I would just like to know one thing, how much of this is she supposed to take? - Yeah. - Hymes can't guarantee your safety. Let those three other women testify against Charlie Lloyd. - I thought there were four women? - One of them backed out, apparently it was a long time ago and she's having difficulty remembering the details. - Oh. - I don't like this, Toni, I don't like it at all. - Dad, I know that you're worried, I'm scared too but I can't back down now. - Well at least just get away for awhile. - Where am I gonna go? - I spoke to Aunt Sandy. - I don't wanna go to Seattle. Why am I running? I live here. - She's right, Jack. - No, wait a minute, think about it. Two weeks on a beach in Bermuda, could be great. - I do have some good news. - What? - Well, I was thinking about applying to law school. I know it sounds crazy but if you think about it, it's not really any different than being a cop. I would still be out there getting the bad guys. - Ladies and gentleman, Toni Stroud, attorney at law. (sirens wail) - [Officer] License and registration please. Get out of the car, Miss Stroud. - Did I do something wrong, officer? - Your taillights busted. - It is? - See? Your headlights out too. - Yes, you're absolutely right, officer, how careless of me. - Not gonna lose your temper, are you, Toni? (suspenseful music) I'm gonna have to cite you on both of these. (gun cocks) (gunshot fires) (glass shatters) (car tires squeal) - Excuse me, Mr. Stroud? Mrs. Stroud, my name is Pete Maresca, this is Bob Hymes, were from the DA's office, we're prosecuting Charlie Lloyd. We'd like to speak to your daughter please. - [Jack] Haven't you done enough? - Very sorry for your trouble. Hi. - Forget it, I don't have anything else to say. Look what they did to my parents store. - Come on, Toni, people play dirty, doesn't mean that they win. - Well as far as I am concerned, they have won already. - They've only won if you give up and let 'em win. Is that what you're saying, Toni? You're gonna give up now and let that bastard walk? - Why is this whole thing up to me? What about those other women? - Well, there have been some developments. - [Maresca] You see, several more of the women have decided to withdraw their charges. - Why? - Well, one of them's been getting a lot of threats and she just got fed up and withdrew and another one has a new boyfriend that just proposed to her and he doesn't know anything about the rape. - There's more. Anne Davis, the woman from the bakery, apparently she's had a lot of boyfriends. - What does that mean? - It means they were planning to use that against her. - Were? Are you telling me that she's not gonna testify? Well that's great! That doesn't leave much now, does it? - Yes, it does Toni, it leave you. - One lousy charge, one count of rape, my word against his. - That's right, you were always our most credible witness. - Yeah and now I'm your only witness. - That's right, you are, it's up to you now, Toni. You can put Charlie Lloyd away where he belongs or you can cut him lose to rape again. - They will do anything to protect Charlie. I don't think that I can do this anymore. - What're you saying? (solemn music) - That I want my life back. - [Judge] Counselor? - Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentleman, I just wanna remind you that we are here today to try Charlie Lloyd for the rape of Toni Stroud, Miss Stroud is not on trial here today. Miss Stroud was a exceptional, young police officer, she was conscientious, hard working, dedicated. She was the kind of officer that would always go the extra mile, the kind of officer that you wanted on your team. In fact, ladies and gentlemen, everyone on the force felt that way about her until that day that she had to come forward to tell the very painful truth. - The truth, ladies and gentlemen, is that there is no truth. The truth is that there was no rape. The truth is that Toni Stroud wasn't cutting it as a police officer and that in a last, desperate bid to save her job, she simply fabricated the charges against Charlie Lloyd, that is the truth and that is what we intend to prove during the course of this trial. - [Weisberg] Toni. - Who's this guy? - Can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah, it's okay. - You sure? - You're sure? - Yeah, it's okay. - Be right across the street. - How you doin'? - Never better! - Look, I'm really sorry for everything that's happened to you, Toni. I've been wanting to tell you that for a long time. You're a good cop, you didn't deserve this. - Thanks. - I hope they nail him for what he did to you and what he did to our department. - Yeah, well I wish everyone felt that way, maybe then I'd stand half a chance. - Well, anyway, I'm rootin' for ya. Toni, give 'em hell, all right? - Has it been 20 minutes yet? Our takeout must be ready. - I thought I was goin'? - No, I need a break. - Okay, it's that old place in the Delancey Mini Mall. - Oh yeah, right, I know. - I love you. - I love you too, daddy. (solemn music) - Toni? Toni, wait, take it easy, take it easy now. Take it easy, I- - Don't touch me. - Don't get mad at me, all right? I'm not gonna hurt ya. Okay? I just need to talk to ya. Okay? Listen. In a few days, they're gonna put you on that stand, I'm here to ask you not to go through with it. Come on, Toni, what do you want me to say? All right, what do you want me to do? My life is ruined already. - Your life? What about my life! Do you have any idea how hard I worked to become a cop? Do you have any idea what that meant to me? And then you just come along and you take it all away, you bastard. - I came here to give you a chance, you got no idea what they're gonna do to you when they put you on that stand, you haven't got a prayer! And when this whole thing is over with, after you lose, after you've been publicly humiliated, it's not gonna be over. No, you're not gonna be safe anywhere you go. Not here, not anywhere. You think about that. - Mr. Theriot, sir, you were quoted in this newspaper as saying "Charlie and I just wanna put this behind us." Did you make that statement? - Don't recall making that statement, no. - Is Charlie Lloyd a good friend of yours? - Not particularly, no. But he's a good officer and a good man. - Could you just please answer the question, see, because what I'm driving at here is why you chose not to act after you were informed of the rape. - Why? - That is my question, sir. - Because I was told that her reasons for coming forward might be questionable, that's why. - I see and who told you this? - Objection, Your Honor, hear say. - Overruled. You may answer the question. - Captain Daley told me. - And you believed him? - Who am I supposed to believe, her? - And why not her? - Because I know Daley, I've known him for years, Stroud was just a rookie, practically a stranger. - But other women in the community had come forward with similar- - Objection, Your Honor. - Sustained. That last remark will be stricken from the record. Watch yourself, counselor. - I will and I do beg your pardon, Your Honor. So, a newcomer can file a complaint but because her status, or lack of status, her complaint is ignored and the word of a senior man is held as gospel, is that the way it goes, sir? - You don't understand the way the department works, do you? - Obviously I do not, sir. Please, tell us. - You ever heard of a chain of command, counselor? I can't worry about every cop on the force. The only time a cops name comes up is when they're in trouble and I can tell you one thing, Toni Stroud's name had been coming up plenty. - Please tell us, Captain Daley, is it not departmental procedure to report all complaints involving a felony to the prosecutors office? - Yes, it is. - Then why, sir, did you not follow this policy in regards to Miss Stroud's complaint? - Her story just didn't add up. - Why is that? - She seemed more concerned about her job than she did about anything that happened between her and Charlie Lloyd. - Well, excuse me sir, suddenly you're the psychologist here, suddenly you're the judge and the jury in this matter! - Objection, badgering the witness. - Sustained. Counsel will put questions to the witness, refrain from making derogatory observations. - I will do so and I do beg your pardon, Your Honor. Now, Captain Daley, after Miss Stroud reported the rape to you, there was a staff meeting, is that not correct? - I believe so yes, we meet every second Monday. - All right and how many people attended this staff meeting? - 11. - Including yourself and Chief Theriot, is that correct? - Yes. - All right, now sometime during this meeting, someone recommended terminating officer Toni Stroud, is that not correct? - Yes. - And do you remember who that somebody was? - Objection, Your Honor. - [Judge] Overruled, you may answer the question. - No, I don't remember but I do remember that I seconded the motion. - Oh, you did? And on what grounds, sir? - On the grounds that she didn't do her job. - [Maresca] According to whom? - According to me! And according to Chief Theriot and according to the nine other people in that room. They all knew Toni and not one of 'em said a word in her defense. (suspenseful music) - I'll see ya inside, okay? - Hi Toni, tell me something, have you thought about what your life is gonna be like after Charlie's acquitted? - Excuse me, excuse me, is there a problem? Boys? - No, no problem. - Good! - See you on the outside, Stroud. - [Maresca] While this was happening, did you apply any physical resistance to him? - Yes I did but he is a lot stronger than me and he had me pinned down. - [Maresca] I know this is very painful and difficult for you, Toni, but you must tell us now exactly what happened next. - Erm, it was very fast. He climbed on top of me and forced my legs apart and raped me. - [Maresca] Now, prior to this occasion, had you ever had any discussion with Charlie Lloyd about having sex with him? - No. - [Maresca] Did you ever have any sort of romantic interest in Charlie Lloyd? - No. - Did you believe prior to this incident that Charlie Lloyd ever had any sort of romantic interest in you? - No. - Did you report this incident to your superior in the police department at the time it happened? - No, I did not. - Why not? - I was afraid. - [Maresca] Afraid of what? - Erm, I was still under review and I thought that it would affect my job. - And how would reporting a rape by a fellow police officer have any effect on your job? - It would of been my word against his. He had been on the force for many years and had many friends in the department, I was new. And you depend on the people you work with to back you up in the field, I was afraid that they wouldn't be there. So I decided not to say anything and I thought that I could handle it on my own. - Thank you, Your Honor. - Why did you pick Captain Daley to tell? - Because he had always been there for me, I trusted him, he let me down. - Yet you know he would get in trouble if at some point it came out that you had told him about the alleged rape and he never reported it, right? - No, that thought never crossed my mind. - It never occurred to you that you were putting him in a delicate situation? - No. In fact, I didn't even have time to think about it, he caught me at a bad moment. - Let's review some of the things you told Captain Daley. Did Charlie Lloyd make any verbal threats during the alleged attack? - No. - And he never threatened to use a weapon? - No. - [Defense] Or hit you if you resisted? - No. - Did he in fact hit you? - Not but he is a lot- - No will suffice, Miss Stroud. Now I understand from your deposition that were quite confused about how to react, is that correct? - Yes, of course I was confused. - Confused about your feelings for Charlie Lloyd. - Objection, Your Honor! - About what you wanted- - Objection, Your Honor, objection! - Counselor! - [Defense] I'm sorry, Your Honor, it won't happen again. Tell me Miss Stroud, what did you do immediately after the alleged rape? - I, I took a shower. - Is this what you would normally advise a rape victim to do? - No but I- - Aren't rape victims supposed to get themselves to the nearest hospital and report the crime? - [Toni] Yes. - And yet you showered, you washed away all the evidence and waited for your boyfriend to come home. - That's not fair, I told you why I did- - Yes, we've heard it, because you were worried about your job. - Yes! - Well you know something, Miss Stroud? I find this very interesting. You claim that things only started falling apart after you reported the alleged rape but it seems to me that on the very day you claim it happened, you were already worrying about your job. I also understand that you have filed a claim against the city. - Objection, Your Honor, not pertinent. - Overruled, you may proceed. - Thank you, Your Honor. You believe the city terminated you immediately after you reported the alleged rape, is that right? - Yes. - So it's fair to say that you also believe that in order to maintain a successful law suit against the city, you have to convince this jury that you really were raped. (solemn music) - No, that is not fair to say at all. - Are you trying to tell me that you actually think, as you sit here today, that if Charlie Lloyd is acquitted of your rape, you will still have a successful lawsuit against the city? - Yes. - On the grounds that you were fired because you were raped? - Those are not the grounds. The grounds are I was fired because I told a department person what happened to me and that person not only failed to do anything but the sanctions that he took against me resulted in my termination. That has nothing to do with whether or not Charlie Lloyd raped me. It has to do with what they did with that information. Those are two separate and distinct issues and if this trial proves anything, it's that I was right all along but what would happen. The minute I came forward, these people have done nothing but try to destroy me and my family. - [Defense] Very impressive show, Miss Stroud. No more questions. - Your honor? Thank you. Now, Toni, before that terrible day, you didn't really have a worry in the world, did you? - No, I did not. - If it please the court, Your Honor, I refer to state exhibit B. And isn't it true that you had received the best job evaluation of your career just a few days prior to the rape? - Yes, that's true. - And were you not looking forward to the fulfillment of a lifelong dream? - I was, I love being a police officer, I was a good officer. But I made a mistake, I kept quiet about something that I shouldn't have and I convinced myself that that was the only sensible thing to do. Please go on, Toni. Tell us what happened next. - Something.. Something happened that made me realize that I was wrong to keep quiet. It occurred to me that there were probably hundreds of thousands of women out there who at one time or another had kept quiet about something equally horrible or perhaps even more horrible and that they did it because they were like me. They were frightened, frightened for their jobs, frightened of their husbands or their boyfriends, frightened by the community and I thought fear is not a good reason to keep silent, it is wrong and it is selfish and other women might get hurt. So I am glad that I came forward, very glad because it has made me realize that I can never again afford to be afraid. (solemn music) - The jury has a lot to consider, it could take awhile. - I just want this to be over with. - I know. - I've never seen my father cry before. - I just want you to know, Toni, no matter what happens, whatever the verdict is, I'm very proud of you. - Thanks. - Has the jury reached a verdict? - Yes, Your Honor, we have. - May I have it, please? (suspenseful music) Will the defendant please rise. The jury finds the defendant guilty as charged. (gavel bangs) Bailiff, please take the defendant in to custody pending sentencing on the 26th of this month. - Thank you. - [Maresca] Thank you. - Thank you. (news reporters clamoring) - Miss Stroud? Miss Stroud? Anne Davis, you remember me? - Yes, I do. - I just, I just wanted to tell you thank you. - [Toni] In the United States, a rape is reported once every five minutes. In 40% of rapes reported to the police, the rapist is someone the victim knows. Most rapes go unreported. (gentle upbeat music) (light heavenly tone)
