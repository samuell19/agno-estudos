I fear for the fate of this country. Yesterday two women teachers were found murdered. For telling teenagers falling in love is normal, that they're allowed to. It's a 15-year-old girl who tipped off the extremists. We're as sad as you are. What do you know? This is my country. Besides being sad, I'm tired of not seeing it grow up. And despite what you think, I blame French colonisation. That organised plundering. For you. MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR They mean business. They're giving you orders. No one other than ourselves can decide that we must leave. I'd have been surprised. Really surprised. Your stubbornness is getting dangerous. Look at all these people. They're at home here. They're terrorised. They all wish they could leave. They have no choice, no money. It's not cowardly to want to leave. It's about being free. TERROR STRIKES DJELFA Sooner or later, it'll be you. No one can control what's going on these days. You'll end up becoming just another pawn. Your sacrifice will eventually be exploited. I've known you for years. I have respect for you. And for what your community has done. Please, go back to France. Did your car break down? Is any of you a mechanic? If you know how to fix it, be my guest. Should I try? - Should I try? - Is it in neutral? You're in neutral? Go on, try. Will the village need the army to protect it? Because they'll be back someday. Forget the army! It's a disaster. The army won't come. The protection is you. This village grew up with the monastery. Who was that priest, before? A while back, before the war. Brother Bernard? Another one. Old. Brother Daniel. That's him. Brother Daniel. He told my mother not to stay here. Move to a city. There was no more work here. She made him swear to say nothing to my father. Because my mother, she feels good living here. Comfortable. We may be leaving. Why are you leaving? We're like birds on a branch. We don't know if we'll leave. We're the birds. You're the branch. If you go, we lose our footing. Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Let us bless the Lord We render thanks unto Him So you want to leave? I was thinking that. I wonder what my life would be. Your family, in France? They're worried? I'm not sure they realise what's going on here. I haven't said anything. The last time I saw them, it was strange. What do you mean? We celebrated my mum's 80th birthday at a restaurant. I saw everyone. My sisters were there, nephews, nieces, my goddaughter. Everyone was talking, telling stories. Taking pictures. They know that's not my thing. I was there, listening. I was happy. They put me next to my mum. And at the same time... ...I was totally out of it. I was thinking... ...if I stopped everything, if... I could move back home. Get back to work, plumbing. Town council, ire department, chorus. Then I thought, "No, that's not possible." My life's over there. Here. With you. Christian's teaching today was interesting. Don't you think? Did you understand anything? Fuck off! Okay. Just tired. Not his fault. "There was a time when a French toe-punt was crummy "and its Irish equivalent a mere display of folklore. "When these damned men didn't know what to do with their ten digits, "but were great at bending the rules to piss everyone off." Is that all? "Even though we agree with Mr Break-Neck "that our amiable guests "never closed the game out, "we still wonder whether they prefer, deep down, "the dervish-like scrums "and bleak brawls of yesteryear. "Back when players still cared about not being "naughty old men." A little more. Help me, help me. Don't abandon me. Don't abandon me. Please. Help me. Not very pretty. It got infected. Tell him I'll be giving him two shots. An antibiotic and a tetanus shot. He's in pain. He needs medicine. I'll give him a tranquilizer. Let's clean this up. You'll be fine. Glory be to the Father, and the Son and the Holy Spirit World without end Save us, Lord Whilst we watch Keep us, Lord Whilst we sleep And we shall watch with Christ And we shall rest in peace I'm worn out. Does Amedee help out? Fortunately. I don't know how I'd manage otherwise. I've never had so many visits. I'm up to 150 a day. Can you imagine? People come from everywhere around. I'm dealing with new pathologies. Lots of hypertension. They're stressed. Some are in a state of shock. Not to mention the effect on the kids. The villagers may talk about these men we help. Be careful. Throughout my career I've met all sorts of different people. Including Nazis. And even the devil. I'm not scared of terrorists, even less of the army. And I'm not scared of death. I'm a free man. Let the free man through! My men tied him to a truck, dragged him through the city. People jumped for joy. Lucky for him he was dead. Why didn't you stop them? Stop them? Lots of people in the crowd were victims of his atrocities. Family. Friends who died. Many innocent people. Disgraceful. No one should be treated this way. Want to know his favourite torture? Fayattia and others like him deserve no compassion. You're very indulgent with the terrorists. Overindulgent. Rumour has it he was shielding the monastery. Did you ever treat them? Where did you ind him? Two days ago, the Walt's car was ambushed. Near Tikrit. The terrorists got away. We found a wounded man on the ground. His friends ditched him. He talked about his mother. Said his name was Fayattia. My men let him suffer. He died before we could make him our trophy. How can you be sure it's him? Why do you think I asked you here? So? It's him. Get out. Go on. Outside. I sleep badly. The slightest noise wakes me. I think over my life. My choices. As a kid I wanted to be a missionary. Dying for my faith shouldn't keep me up nights. Dying here, here and now, does it serve a purpose? I don't know. I feel like I'm going mad. It's true that staying here... ...is as mad as becoming a monk. Remember. You've already given your life. You gave it by following Christ. When you decided to leave everything. Your life, your family, your country. The family you could have raised. I don't know if it's true anymore. I pray. And I hear nothing. I don't get it. Why be martyrs? For God? To be heroes? To prove we're the best? We're martyrs out of love, out of fidelity. If death... ...overtakes us, despite ourselves, because up to the end, up to the end we'll try to avoid it, our mission here is to be brothers to all. Remember that love is eternal hope. Love endures everything. I'm sorry. Like patched earth I stand before you, Lord O Lord, hear my prayer Listen to my cry for mercy In your faithfulness, answer me Enter not into judgment with your servant For no man living is righteous before you The enemy persecutes my soul He has smitten my life to the ground He has made me dwell in darkness With those long dead My spirit grows faint within me My heart within me, dismayed Answer me quickly, O Lord My spirit fails Do not hide your face from me Lest I be like them who fall into the pit We've received so many letters recently. People are worried. I can't answer them all. There's that French journalist who wants to meet us. I don't know what to tell her. We shouldn't expose ourselves further by doing publicity. Of course, but... ...it's a way of making people understand our choices. To show that amid all this drama, for people here, there's reason for hope. You know, hope is not what interests journalists. It doesn't mobilise them. Exactly. Maybe we should mobilise them. I suggest we take a vote. To see if we're all of one mind. Who wants to leave? I've already told you my position on this matter and my calling is to be here, with everyone. I don't see myself leaving. Leaving would lead nowhere. I'm not ready to leave myself. Last night I thought about leaving. I'm not comfortable with it. Not at peace. Deciding to run off like that makes no sense. We didn't come here for our own personal interest. I still think that our mission here is not finished. I'm staying. I prayed all morning while I was cooking. The disciple is not above his master. This is no time for me to stray. Let God set the table here. For everyone. Friends and enemies. And you, Christian? Wildflowers don't move to ind the sun's rays. God makes them fecund wherever they are. Who prefers to stay? You. You envelop me, hold me, surround me. You embrace me. And I love you. - Where do you live? - In town. - ID. - I don't have it on me. - Where do you live? - Just nearby. - ID. - I don't have them. - Where do you live? - The village. Stop this nonsense! These women and children are here to be treated. This is not a police station! Enough! Unbelievable. Sit down. Follow me. I recently read this pensee of Pascal's, "Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully "as when they do it from religious conviction." Here it is mayhem and violence. We are in a high-risk situation, but we persist in our faith and our confidence in God. It is through poverty, failure and death that we advance towards him. Heavy devastating downpours have put no damper on the spread of violence. Two opponents, one clutching onto power, the other out to seize it. They'll fight to the bitter end. I don't know when or how it will end. In the meantime, I do my duty... Caring for the poor and the sick, awaiting the day I close my eyes. Dear friend, pray for me, that my leaving this world will in the peace and joy of Jesus. O Father Of light Eternal light! And source of all light You illuminate us, at the threshold of night With the radiance of your face The shadows, for you Are not shadows For you, night ls as clear as day May our prayers before you Rise like incense And our hands like the evening offering Welcome, Bruno. Celestin. Christophe. Hello, Luc. Jean-Pierre. Amedee. - Hosts. - For me. For us. For us all. Medicine. For Luc. Lots of medicine. - You found it? - I found your book. Is it the right one? "The Chosen". Cheese! Any news of Brother Didier? Of course he said to say hello. And I have a letter for you. So how was your trip? How long was it? It took a while to come from the diocese. At least three hours. There were three checkpoints! Between the last two checkpoints there was a bus burning on the roadside. Smoke coming out of it. And we didn't know if the checkpoints were real or fake. On the way here, as we got closer, there were fewer vehicles. Many soldiers? Yes, near the checkpoints. They were all very tense. Out of the question to speak to them. - How do we stand? - However we want. Short ones up front. Squeeze in closer. Ready? Set... Let's take another. Smile a little. I've often thought of that time. That time... ...when Ali Fayattia and his men left. Once they were gone... ...all we had left to do was to live. And the first thing we did was... ...two hours later. We celebrated the Christmas Vigil and Mass. It's what we had to do. It's what we did. And we sang the Mass. We welcomed that child who was born for us... ...absolutely helpless and... ...and already so threatened. Afterwards, we found salvation in undertaking our daily tasks. The kitchen, the garden, the prayers, the bells. Day after day. We had to resist the violence. And day after day, I... I think each of us discovered that to which Jesus Christ beckons us. It's... ...to be born. Our identities as men go from one birth to another. And from birth to birth, we'll each end up bringing to the world the child of God that we are. The Incarnation, for us, is to allow the filial reality of Jesus to embody itself in our humanity. The mystery of Incarnation remains... ...what we are going to live. In this way what we've already lived here takes root as well as what we're going to live in the future. "Whoever tries to save his life shall lose it, "and whoever shall lose it, preserves it. "l tell you, on that night, two people shall be in one bed. "One shall be taken, the other left. "Two women shall be grinding grain together. "One shall be taken, the other left. "The disciples asked him, 'Where, Lord?' "He answered, 'Where there is a body, "'there too the vultures shall gather.'" The Gospel of the Lord. Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ. The body of Christ. The body of Christ. Lord, blessed art thou for this meal which unites us as brothers now and... ...world without end. Hurry up! Move! Hurry, faster! Hurry, get dressed. I just got here. I can't. I said don't push! Careful with that medicine. it's for the children, not you. It's very precious. Stop pushing me! That's enough! Calm down! I am Brother Paul. A monk at the Monastere de l'Atlas. And I'm in good health. I am Brother Celestin. I'm 63. A monk at the Monastere de l'Atlas. I'm in good health. Your turn, Luc. My name is Brother Luc. From the Monastere de l'Atlas. I heard what they're saying on the news. I've been taken hostage with my colleagues by the Jama... - What's it called? - Islamiyya. Jama Islamiyya, that's it. Your turn, Christian. In the early hours of Friday morning, the Mujahideen read us the bayan of the Jama Islamiyya Moussalaha. - It says... - Signed by? Signed by Abu Abderrahamane Amine. It says we're being held hostage and demands that the French government free hostages belonging to their group in exchange for our liberation. This exchange is non-negotiable. Did you hear? Should it ever befall me, and it could happen today, to be a victim of the terrorism swallowing up all foreigners here, I would like my community, my church, my family, to remember that my life was given to God and to this country. That the Unique Master of all life was no stranger to this brutal departure. And that my death is the same as so many other violent ones, consigned to the apathy of oblivion. I've lived enough to know I am complicit in the evil that, alas, prevails over the world and the evil that will smite me blindly. I could never desire such a death. I could never feel gladdened that these people I love be accused randomly of my murder. I know the contempt felt for the people here, indiscriminately. And I know how Islam is distorted by a certain Islamism. This country, and Islam, for me are something different. They're a body and a soul. My death, of course, will quickly vindicate those who called me naive or idealistic, but they must know that I will be freed of a burning curiosity and, God willing, will immerse my gaze in the Father's and contemplate with him his children of Islam as he sees them. This thank-you which encompasses my entire life includes you, of course, friends of yesterday and today, and you too, friend of the last minute, who knew not what you were doing. Yes, to you as well I address this thank-you and this farewell which you envisaged. May we meet again, happy thieves in Paradise, if it pleases God, the Father of us both. Amen. Inchallah. Christian, Luc, Christophe, Celestin, Paul, Michel and Bruno were killed on May 21, 1996. The identity of their murderers and the circumstances of their deaths remain a mystery. Amedee died on July 27, 2008. Jean-Pierre is still alive. He is now 86. Subtitles: Andrew Litvack ripped by carrot
