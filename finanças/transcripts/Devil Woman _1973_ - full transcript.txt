Sure, why not? Yeah. Anyhow, you all know that snakes are controlled by the devils. That's right. Otherwise, why should they kill people after midnight? Ooh. Yeah, you can say that again. Yeah, it didn't happen on accident. That's for sure. No. Now heaven is angry, so there's a drought. Besides, devil's always work in the dark, hmm. He's around here somewhere.

Right, he is injured. Oh? Mr. Crispin is? He's my father. That's fine. Get on. I'll lead the way. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Mr. Crispin, Tina is back with Mr. Sherwin. Sherwin? [OMINOUS MUSIC] [PLEASANT MUSIC] Tina, Sherwin, Mr. Crispin is waiting for you. Oh, it's been a long time. Yeah, come on in. Mr. Crispin, this is Mr. Sherwin I told you about. Mr. Sherwin, are you Chinese? Yes. Dad, Mr. Sherwin's Kung Fu is terrific. If [INAUDIBLE],, heaven knows what. Must be those village rascals again. I'm obliged. That's really nothing. Any man would have done the same thing. Dad, let's ask Mr. Sherwin to have dinner here. Thank you. Mr. Crispin, Shinchu told me you've injured your leg. How did it happen? Let me have a look now. He fell off the stairs. Sherwin, have some tea. No, I'll take a look first. Yes. [GRUNTING] [APPLAUSE] Hey, who was that Chinese who just came? He's so conceited. I can't stand him. I don't know who he is, but he's trouble for us. Chief, he's with Tina every day. Maybe he's after her. Mm. Come on! [EXCLAMATIONS] Open it! [SHOUTING] Go on. What do you want? Oh.

TINA: What should I call you? My name, of course, Sherwin. Then you call me Tina. Mm. I almost forgot. My father has something to give you. Oh? What is it? I'll get it. Huh. [CHUCKLES] Since Crispin's leg's cured, why don't you leave? Don't stay here and imagine things. When there's a boat, you leave on it, eh? No sense in staying. People like him, you don't tell them straight, they'll never leave. [LAUGHTER] God damn it. It's a dummy. [LAUGHTER] [GROANING] [THUDDING] TINA: Stop it! Huh? Come on, now, on your feet-- on your feet, let's go. What's the matter with you people? Can't you walk yet? Get up. Let me tell you-- he's our family friend. If anyone bullies him, he's dismissed. Cousin, we're just having fun. What's the problem? Fun? What's so funny? You're not a kid anymore. Take it easy. Let me. What are you doing? Why pick on me? What are you doing, huh? Damn it! [GRUNTING] From now on, I don't want to see these rascals. Ask them to leave. Chinaman, I'll get even with you. If Tina didn't show up, you'd be dead already. Get back. Did you hear what happened? Last night, this town was robbed again. Yes, a lot of them were killed. It's terrible. Hey, listen-- did you guys know that all of them were not killed. They were bitten by snakes. Oh. Oh. Hey, the captain's here. Yeah, Captain. MAN: Captain? Careful, it could be tonight. MAN: Ah, ah. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GROANING] [METALLIC HUMMING] [SNAKE HISSING] [SHRIEKING] [EXCLAMATIONS] BOY: Don't take it! Don't take it! Give it back to me! Help! Bastard! [PEACEFUL MUSIC] MAN: Manda! Manda! Manda! Manda! Manda! Manda! Manda. I told you not to look for me. Many people were killed last night. I know this must be your work. You mean you knew it all along? Yes, I know. Then you will understand why I have to do it. I understand. You're revenging your dead parents. But I believe your parents wouldn't like you to do so. Sure. They can't speak anymore. Manda, as I recall, they won't even kill an ant. Please don't mention anything about my parents. I guess. You must know why I am here. You're wrong. I understand nothing. And I don't want to. I don't even realize your intentions. I'm very sorry. [SIGHS] Manda? Manda! Manda. Don't follow me. Look what's on the ground. [SNAKE HISSING] Don't be scared. [PLEASANT MUSIC] [SHRIEKING] WOMAN: Let me go! Please! Let me go, please! [SHRIEKING] [LAUGHTER] [SHRIEKING] Is everyone happy? Ah, you bet they are. [CHUCKLES] And you? Uh.

[APPLAUSE] I came up here to clarify the fact that I never challenged Mr. Victor. I'm sorry to disappoint everybody. [CROWD BOOING] The host has many other programs in store for you all. I think boxing ends here. [CROWD BOOING] [THUDDING] Hold it. All right, all right. [APPLAUSE] Yea, they're gonna fight. [EXCLAMATIONS] [LAUGHTER] Are you ready? Ready. Go on, cut him up! Hit him! [THUDDING] [APPLAUSE] [GROANING] [THUDDING] All right, you win. [APPLAUSE] You were great, wonderful. Tina. Tina, don't go away. Listen to me. I really love you. Waldo, I'm sorry. I don't mean to hurt you, but I think you know what I mean. You don't love me? Who do you love? That Chinese? That's my business. I know how to choose. Say anything you want, but I'll never give up. That's my right. I don't care what you do. Right now, I've got work to do. [OMINOUS MUSIC] [PEACEFUL MUSIC] [OMINOUS MUSIC] Chinaman, you remember what I said before? I'll flatten you. And now I'm going to do it. Go ahead. [GRUNTING] [GROANING] [THUDDING] [CHATTER] [GROANING] [THUDDING] Hey. [WHISPERING] Is he reliable? Of course he is. I'll see you again real soon.

[OMINOUS MUSIC] [SNAKE HISSING] [GASPS] [MOANING] Where did they discover the body? In the river. His face is green. [GASPING] Oh, terrible. MAN: Frightening, frightening. They must be bitten by snakes. Poisonous snakes could be. What a pity, a nice young man, not even married. Yeah, that's a terrible thing. Here. Better not go out tonight. Yes. I wonder who's going to be next victim. WOMAN: Thank you. Yeah. MAN: A frightening experience. [FOOTSTEPS] [PEACEFUL MUSIC] [OMINOUS MUSIC] Huh? Ahh! What are you doing here? [SIGHS] It's you, Manda. I've been looking for you. What do you want? In the village and towns, many were killed. Why come to ask me? I don't want to know who did all the killings. Manda, please trust me. Do you remember, during our childhood, you used to tell me I'm the only one that likes to play with you in the village. [PLEASANT MUSIC] Manda! Manda! Manda, so you are here. I've been looking for you. What do you want? Let's go and play why are you staying here alone? Everyone is avoiding me. Why did you come here? Oh, because your father's poor. That's why they don't want to make friends with you. But my father is poor too. I'm just the same like you. I see. That's why you come to me. OK, let's go. Yes, it was because of me you fought with [INAUDIBLE].. [SIGHS] Good. I'm glad that you recall. Actually, I missed you so very much during the past years. I miss you too.
