I KEEP WONDERING IF HE'S PAYING ATTENTION. THAT WAS IN, LIKE, 1969, I THINK. HIS FIRST PLAY? OH, WOW. AND HE WAS ALSO ON THE COUNCIL OF THE DRAMATISTS GUILD... FROM 1973 TO... SOMETHING LIKE '76, '77. THEY CAN CHECK IF THEY WANT. WELL, I'M SURE HIS AGENT CAN SEND OVER A PICTURE OF HIM. OKAY. AND YOU WANT IT TO SAY THAT SEAN IS SURVIVED... BY HIS LONGTIME COMPANION, DAVID ELDERS. HERE. WHY DON'T THEY SAY "LOVER"? THAT'S FOR ME. THEY DIDN'T USED TO SAY ANYTHING. THEY DIDN'T USED TO SAY "GAY." ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA GO CALL. THANK YOU. SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE "LOVER." DO THEY? I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'M GONNA MISS HAVING HENRY... TO CLEAN UP AFTER THE TWO OF US. IT'S JUST SO FUCKING... NOT STRANGE. YOU KNOW? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT'S JUST NOT STRANGE. AFTER SEAN HAD DIED AND BEFORE DAVID GOT SICK HIMSELF, I REMEMBER DAVID SAYING HE WANTED HIS OWN MEMORIAL, WHENEVER, TO BE REAL SIMPLE... OR SEAN WOULD NEVER FORGIVE HIM FOR OUTDOING HIS. AND THAT, I THINK, MORE THAN ANYTHING... EPITOMIZES WHO DAVID WAS. SOMEONE... UNLIKE ANYONE ELSE. UH... UH, I'M WILLY WOLLF. EVERYBODY SAID HOW, UH, FUNNY DAVID WAS. AND, UH... BUT, UH, HE ALSO DID AMAZING THINGS FOR OTHER PEOPLE, UH, WHEN THEY NEEDED HIM TO. HE NEVER MADE A BIG DEAL ABOUT BEING FILTHY RICH AND... UH, THE MOST... REMARKABLE THING I EVER SAW ANYBODY DO... WAS THE WAY HE... TOOK CARE OF SEAN... AND, UH, GAVE HIM WHAT HE WANTED, WHICH WAS, YOU KNOW, TO DIE AT HOME. WHICH WASN'T EASY FOR DAVID. AND THE DOCTORS ADVISED HIM AGAINST IT, FOR HIS SAKE. DAVID... TAUGHT ME THAT... LIFE IS ONLY WHAT YOU PUT INTO IT. OR WHAT YOU GIVE AWAY. I MEAN OF YOURSELF, NOT YOUR MONEY. UH, BECAUSE HE WAS NOT GENEROUS WHEN IT CAME TO PICKING UP THE TAB. UH, I MET DAVID ALMOST, UH, NINE YEARS AGO. HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE I MET WHEN I MOVED TO THE CITY. AND... HE IMMEDIATELY PUT THE MOVES ON ME, YOU KNOW. AND... THE THING I REMEMBER MOST WAS, UH, THE WAY WHEN I MET FUZZY, ALLEN, HE JUST TOOK HIM INTO THE FAMILY. AND THAT WAS THAT. THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION. FUZZY, UH, BECAME AN IMMEDIATE FRIEND. AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY CLASSY. HE WAS, UH, REALLY CLASSY. YES! OKAY. DAVID WENT HOME. DO YOU WANNA TELL THIS? DAVID WENT HOME TO BRYN MAWR FOR HIS SISTER'S WEDDING. SHE WAS THERE TODAY. I KNOW. DON'T THEY LOOK ALIKE? AND EVERYBODY WAS OUT AT THE REHEARSAL DINNER. DAVID WAS ALONE IN THE HOUSE. SO HE WENT UPSTAIRS TO SEE HIS OLD BEDROOM. AND HANGING ON THE BACK OF THE DOOR IS THE WEDDING DRESS. SAM, YOU HAVE TO HEAR THIS. AND, YOU KNOW, APPARENTLY, HE TOOK A LOOK AT IT AND HE THOUGHT, "OH, WHAT THE HELL." - WHAT THE HELL. - NOBODY'S GONNA SEE. THIS IS DAVID AT HIS SISTER'S WEDDING. AND HE PUT IT ON. - THE WEDDING DRESS. - THE WEDDING DRESS. - I NEVER HEARD THIS. AND HE'S STANDING OUT IN THE HALL ADMIRING HIMSELF IN IT IN THE MIRROR. AND HE BACKS UP TO GET A BETTER LOOK, KICKS THE TRAIN, WHICH SOMEHOW CAUGHT HIS FOOT. HE FELL DOWN THE ENTIRE FLIGHT OF STAIRS BACKWARDS. KNOCKED OUT COLD. WHEN THE FAMILY COMES HOME FROM THE REHEARSAL, HE'S STILL OUT, THREE BROKEN RIBS. THEY HAVE TO CUT HIM OUT OF THE DRESS WITH SCISSORS. THE AMBULANCE GUYS ARE THERE, THE PARAMEDICS. THE DRESS, OF COURSE, IS RUINED. THE SISTER IS LMD. LEGAL. HI. WHAT'S UP? DID SOMEBODY TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS? WAIT. HIS NAME IS... I JUST HAD IT. FRANKLIN WASHINGTON. HE'S AN I. V. DRUG USER. NO. HE'S STILL IN CABRINI WITH P. C. P. CAN YOU GET A BED FOR HIM AT BAILEY HOUSE? HE'S GONNA BE OUT ON THE STREET. I GUESS HE HAD A LEASE OR... HIS GIRLFRIEND DID. HE DOESN'T HAVE A BUDDY ASSIGNED. HI, ALBERTO. IT'S WILLY. HOW ARE YOU? OKAY. GOT YOUR LAUNDRY. THANKS. OH, AND, UH, FUZZY SAID HE SPOKE TO MEDICAID FOR YOU. AND THEY'LL GET YOU, UH, A REPLACEMENT CARD. - OR YOU CAN CALL YOURSELF ANYTIME, OKAY? - OKAY. YOU HAVE THE NUMBER? OKAY. GETTING ANY EXERCISE? STILL FEELING, UH, WOBBLY? GOOD. YOU LOOK BETTER. WELL, SO, I'M JUST ON LUNCH, SO, UH... COULD YOU STRAIGHTEN UP A LITTLE IN THE KITCHEN? SURE. YOU WANNA HELP ME? YOUR LEGS BOTHERING YOU NOW? WELL, YOU SHOULD GET UP. FORGET IT, WILLY. I'M REAL CONFUSED. YOUR DOCTOR TELLS ME YOU'RE WELL ENOUGH TO START DOING THINGS. BUT YOU WON'T LIFT A FINGER. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T... I DON'T THINK I'LL BE NEEDING YOU ANYMORE, WILLY. THANK YOU. YOU CAN JUST LEAVE THE KEYS. YOU'RE FIRED, YOU GOT IT? I'M A VOLUNTEER. I DON'T GET PAID. YOU DON'T FIRE ME. YOU WALK WELL FOR SOMEBODY WHO WON'T GET OUT OF BED. COME ON. I WANT MY KEYS. I THINK YOU'RE REALLY, REALLY PISSED OFF, AND I DON'T BLAME YOU. BUT IF YOU ALLOW YOURSELF TO JUST WASTE AWAY, I... I FEEL... I'M SORRY. I KNOW I'M NOT ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS OR YOUR FAMILY. BUT, UH...
