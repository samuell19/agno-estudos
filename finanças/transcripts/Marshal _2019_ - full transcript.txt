NO ANIMALS OR BIRDS ARE HARMED IN THE MAKING OF THE FILM THE STORY, CHARACTERS AND THE SCENES ARE FICTITIOUS. THEY DOESN'T RESEMBLE ANYONE. With courage in the eyes, roaring voice, generous nature and helping hand when someone seeks your help is your nature, Uncle./i> The great man who brought great honour to the Adaka clan and the man with pure heart is none other than our A.R. Though you have gone into darkness before we've stepped along with you, your inspiration would become our light and show us our path, uncle. I'm making your last spoken words with me into reality and dedicating this movie to you. You are not the past. You are the future. A.R lives on. There's was a nuclear bomb attack in Hiroshima, Japan which caused the deaths of nearly eighty thousand people. Due to the nuclear explosion the radiation levels jump multifold. The medical council of Japan feared that a generation gap might occur due to that. Due to the occurance of Tsunami in Japan, Fukushima nuclear plant exploded and the radiation levels rised massively again. There was rise of female reproductive system complications due to radiation. The Japan's medical council stated that there'd be more number of infertile women. How will Japan face this problem is the biggest question.

And coming to the point... If you pay me five crore rupees, I'll handover to you safely. Otherwise, I will upload the movie online. [tyres screech] [vehicles honk] [tyres screech] [tyres screech] People: Hail Shivaji... Hail Shivaji... [shatters] It is superstar Shivaji. It is superstar Shivaji. Wow! It is superstar Shivaji! -He is very handsome! -Hey, go away! [glass shatters] [glass shatters] [groans] Smash him, sir! [groans] Do it, sir! Hey! The yeild that comes out of day and night toil of 200 people for 200 days is cinema. [groans] Hey, wait... Wait... How can you sell the dream of a director, life of a producer and the future of thousands of people online? We make movies out of passion, not money. We will tolerate to any scale when it is needed. But when something goes wrong, we will retaliate to any extent. -Hey, get up... Come on. -Grr... [crowd cheering] Okay... Okay... Brother... please do one dance step for us. [whistles] "No person is a match in front of you" "when we are all behind you as an army" "The whole world celebrates just when the first look is out" "The release of teaser would do become a trending video on YouTube" "The countdown starts when they announce the movie release dates" "And all the fans would have sleepless nights" "On the release day of your movie, all the theatre would have your cut-outs" "Those cut-outs would be milk bathed and the coconut-breaking ceremony takes place" "When the happiness overflows and the excitement swings us" "The atmosphere in the theatre becomes like a fair upon seeing the first frame" "When we see your flamboyant entry, we'll get into a trance" "There'd be whistling and shower of paper pieces for every dialogue" "Star... Star... Star... You are the superstar in our hearts" "Star... Star... Star... You are the star shining in our eyes" "Star... Star... Star... You are the superstar in our hearts" "Star... Star... Star... You are the star shining in our eyes" "Yeah..." Actually doctor, the age of our marriage is five years. Initially, we didn't want to have kids. But now we are planning to have a baby. The problem is I don't want to take the pain from the stage of conceiving to delivery. So I want to become a mother without getting even a small scar on my body. Can you help me? Of course, we can. Hmm... This is called surrogacy. How does it work? Very simple... See there. We'll extract eggs from you and get it fertilized with your husband's sperm. The embryo formed will be deposited into gestational surrogate uterus. It means the womb of surrogate mother. She'd pregnant and you'd become parents. -It is good, isn't it? -Yes. The surrogate mother would take the pain and we'd get the baby. [laughs] But... It is an expensive process. How much does it cost? Er... Around 75 lakh rupees. No problem. -It works for us. -Yeah. One second... Can we meet the surrogate mother before we proceed? No, I am sorry. Meeting them is against our rules. How can we proceed further without meeting the mother after paying such a hefty amount? We just want to meet them once. Okay... Yeah... Shankar... Can you please come over here? Hello... You people talk to her. -Greetings. -Greetings, madam. What is your name? Sandhya, madam. How much do you get paid for doing this? Just 50 thousand, madam. Go on... We get two meals a day. We'll eat and sleep here only. We have been given a contract for nine months. We don't get to see the outside world or meet those who came for us. Becoming a mother by giving birth is an old method. But buying a womb would make you a mother as well and it is the new trend which is nothing but surrogacy. [applause] [people congratulating] Thank you... Thank you... -Congratulations sister. -Hey... Thanks... -Congratulations, Megha... -Thank you... -Congratulations Megha -Thanks. Some doctors are making money by selling the wombs of women. They'd charge lakhs of rupees from the clients who seek have children through surrogacy. and exploit the surrogate mother by paying them just a mere 50 thousand. Okay, sir. -Send them today at any cost. -Sure, sir. I'll send the samples. -Call me after sending that files. -Sure, sir. Idli, again? It looks like an expensive tablet with fat around it, mom. Feed me anything which is not white in colour and circular shape. Fine, just have it. [coughs] Why don't you wake up early instead of eating breakfast hurriedly? You'd wake up at 6 am when there is a movie release. It's not a movie mom, it's my Boss's movie. Getting the first rank wouldn't even match to the feeling of watching his movie on the first day first show. You'll progress if you work for your actual boss who pays your salary. But when you work for your movie boss, you'll reach late to your office. Mom, don't you consider passion and profession as one. His movie has collected more than 100 crores in just a week. My foot! You won't understand it anyway. Leave it. Stop your nonsense, bro. Elder sister! Don't claim an average movie to collect huge box office collections and pester us. You have lost the bet. Pay me 500 rupees. Forget about it. You lost a cricket match with me last time. So, it became even now. Oh you deceitful! Is there any connection between cricket and a movie? Of course, there is. Alright. Come now. I'll settle your bet money now in the cricket match. Is it? Enough of your show-off. Just do the bowling. [utensils clang] [gasps] Oh! Have you started it upon your arrival? It's of no use to tell you. We have to blame your husband. Excuse me! My husband is an impeccable person! Go and take care of your husband, mom. You continue bowling, bro. -Please pass the ball, mom... Please, mom. -Mom, pass the ball. You people are incorrigible! Come on, do the bowling. Woman's voice in background: What's the use of a beautiful girl when she can't bear a child? You have become a burden to our family by not bearing children. Someday, I will get my son remarried. Woohoo! Yeah! Woohoo! Sister... What happened? Nothing... Got a dust particle in my eye. Okay... Okay... Okay... Hi darling! -Dad! -When did you come? Where is my son in law? He dropped me and went to work. He said he'll come in the evening. -[singing] -See how I'll fool him. -[clears throat] Dude... -Yes. Serve us two cups of tea. Not two, make it four. -Hi, dude. -Alright... Alright... Yeah, serve them too. Not just irritation and headache, to get rid of all kinds of pain, use Panchatulasi Everything goes away in a snap. Hey... Hey... What's with you? You're like a roadside roots and herbs seller. He promotes his products everywhere. Hey, the manager wants to see you immediately. Phew! He doesn't even make me finish my tea if I don't achieve my targets! Alright guys. Bye. -Bye. Get to your work. -Get your work. Dude, serve us tea. Here... Take it. Hey, what are the updates? I've been to Koyal hospital to promote Dicodin. There's a buzz about the new infertility treatment and the doctors were very busy. I've got annoyed and came back to the office. Friends, the targets for this month are still incomplete. If this continues for the next month, all of you have to find a new job. Understand? People: No, sir. We'll achieve our targets for sure. Nani and team, go to the hospital situated opposite to Sandhya theatre. Nani and team: Okay, sir. Srinu and team, go to the hospital beside Konark theatre, Dilshuknagar. Srinu and team: Okay, sir. Praveen. He always addresses with cinema theatres names but not the actual the name of the hospitals. Hey! Sorry. Praveen, you guys go to the hospital situated opposite to Arjun theatre, Kukatpally. -Okay? -Praveen and team: Okay, sir. Who'd be going to the hospitals in Filmnagar area? There are no theatres in that area. Sir... -Come to my cabin -Sir... Sir... Sir... Sir... Abhi... You know about the enormous competition in our medical field. Sir... When that's the case, how hard one should work to manage our office. -Sir... -Yes, your guess is right. You are appointed as the area manager. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much. By the way, Abhi... Sir... -This is a beauty enhancing pill. -Sir... -It's not released in the market yet. -Sir... So, we have to promote this product in the upcoming beauty contest. Yeah. And... From now on, this room is all yours along with the office. -Thank you, sir. Thank you so much. -All the best. [phone rings] Hello. I'm coming. Yeah! I'll be there in five minutes. Yeah... [tyres screech] I'll come quickly. Hey... Hey... Who are you? Help... -Hold her. -[groans] Hey! Help... Somebody help. Help... -Hey, stop there. -Help... The plan is cancelled! Leave the place immediately. Okay, brother. Shiva go. Hey, wait. -[phone] you know the case details, right? -Excuse me, sir. Okay. Yeah, Abhi. Someone has kidnapped a girl near the Punjagutta traffic signal, dad. Kidnap? Did you see the vehicle registration number? Yes, dad. AP 28 TB 2110. 2110. Abhi... There is no vehicle registered with this number. Is it? Hmm... Relax, Abhi. I will track them down by watching the CCTV footage. Don't worry. Okay, dad. [phone rings] Tell me. Hey, the brother-in-law is home. I've made all the arrangements. -Come immediately. -Hmm... [bottles clink] In unison: Cheers! Bro, are you an earthquake hacker? It is ethical hacker, not earthquake hacker. Be it anything. Brother-in-law, you have to offer me big help. What is that? Chandu evaded payment of money to me and has been avoiding me and roaming around since two months. Trace him and tell me his location. What's his mobile number? [dials] 9642... 333... 111 [laptop blips] Here, you go. [laptop blips] Bloody hell! He pretended as if he's residing in a foreign country by in hiding next door. How much does he owe you? One lakh rupees. Where did you get such a huge amount from? I will get it if he lends it to me. What? I asked him for a loan of one lakh rupees two months ago. -And he's been avoiding me since then. -Oh, you! You are brilliant, brother-in-law. I couldn't find him since two months but you've traced in just two minutes. Huh! I've been able to solve everyone's problems very easily but not mine. Brother-in-law, don't you ever get upset with my sister? Of course, I do. I get upset on your sister for having immense love for me. I get upset on me for not loving your sister more than the way she loves me. When everyone is humiliating her by calling her sterile, I get very upset with God who's been only watching us calmly. Bother-in-law... When this is the case, there's a wide range of options in the world to overcome this. Why don't you just go for adoption? My mother is under the superstition that my father will be born as our child. She won't accept if we go for adoption. I can't understand how to hack this problem. I've been to Koyal hospital to promote Dicodin. There's a buzz about the new infertility treatment and the doctors were very busy. I have heard about a hospital in the noon. The hospital claims that it can cure any kind of infertility problems. Let's visit that hospital. Please, brother-in-law. Suma. Please come. -Sit down. -Please. Tell me, what is the problem. We have been married for seven years but we're unable to have kids. We have been to so many hospitals but of no use. We were told that she has some egg release problem. We heard that your hospital has a new treatment for this kind of complications. Yeah. All the reports are normal. No problem. There is a 100 percent chance that you'd become parents. But the treatment process will take up a minimum of 4 to 5 weeks. Okay, doctor. Please start the process as early as possible. Okay. She will take care. -What did the doctor say, sister? -He was positive about it. Come, let's go. Like every year, several girls from the two states participated in beauty contest this year. -Girls: Hi...-This most awaited grand finale will be held in our Hyderabad today. Not just for the winners and runners-up, every finalist will be provided with a job and that's the speciality of the contest. The founder of NGR trust and today's chief guest, Superstar Shivaji will arrive here soon. This is a challenging product for us. Every girl here should have our product. -Make sure no girls miss that. Okay? -Definitely, bro. -In unison: We will take care. -Look here. -Ma'am, beauty pills. -Thank you. -Excuse me. -Ma'am, beauty pills. Thanks. -Here, take this. -Here... Ma'am, beauty pills. -Here... -Ma'am, beauty pills. What are these guys doing here? -Hold this -Where are you going? It would have looked much better with proper lighting. -Hey -Huh! What are you doing here when I have asked you to set up the camera? -It's right there. -We'll get it now. -Excuse me. -Hmm... I saw you the other day at Punjagutta traffic signal. You got kidnapped... Oh! You too saw that video? Video? That video became viral on social media. Wherever I go, everybody is recognizing me just like you did. What do you mean by video? We wanted to see people's reaction when a girl gets abducted in the broad daylight. So, we did a prank video. A girl got abducted by four guys in the broad daylight. Do you know how worried I've been thinking about what they might have done to that girl and tortured her? Your image haunted me whenever I saw a girl. I couldn't even breathe normally out of that thought. Don't play with the emotions of people for your channel's ratings. Try to educate people, not fool them. Have some responsibility! If you ever plan any more prank videos, I will chop you and upload that video on YouTube. It will become even more viral. Welcome to Superstar NGR memorial trust beauty contest of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. [applause] A warm welcome to our superstar Mr Shivaji. [people cheering] The grand finale will start in the next few minutes. [people cheering] So, let's welcome our superstar Mr Shivaji on to the dais. A big round of applause for Mr Shivaji. It's time to announce Miss Andhra Pradesh. Miss Supriya. Now, Miss Telangana... Miss Prasanna. People claim a woman is the inception of this creation. But I claim that woman herself is the creator. [applause] My father always told me that the women fans are the reason for his superstardom. So, I have started this beauty contest to support you, who have always supported my father. You have to rock in this male-dominated society! [women cheering and applauding] All the best. Love you! Thank you, sir. And thank you everyone for coming for this event. -Sir... Sir... Sir... -Sir... Sir... One selfie... Here... Sir... -Did you get a selfie at least this time? -Damn! No? -Missed again. -Tsk! -Even I couldn't get it. -Me too. Alright. Better luck next time. [phone ringing] Hello Bro, come to our spot. [telugu song playing] We came here running when you have called us and told that you're throwing a party. Why don't you bother about us? Do you guys see my frustration like some kind of party? Yeah! Of course -Yeah! Of course. -Yeah! Of course. Why do you say that despite my explanation, you alcoholics? Is it what you are doing by calling me and citing emergency? Enough of your show-off! Come out of it. Does my pain seem like show-off to you? Hey, the winner gets the limelight in any field. Take for example Chiranjeevi, Dhoni, Ambani etc. But in love, the losers get the limelight. Take for example Devadas, Majnu and Tulasi. What's his problem? Ramya said pack up to his love. Hmph! Hey! I meant break-up. Please respect her. After all, she is my ex-girlfriend. I gave her so many gifts and lifts. But in return, she gave me a big twist in the end. It's nature of all the girls. They behave like a miser when they were asked to buy with their money. But when we say we will pay their bills, they'd want to buy everything. Well said, mate! Give him a beer. Thanks, dude! Well, what have you decided? Generally, when a girl breaks up with her boyfriend, he would delete her number from his phone book, unfriend her on Facebook and block her on Whatsapp. But this idiot is asking me to return all the gifts he gave me. Huh? [spits] No matter if you spit on me or taunt me, this decision will last forever in history. My decision should become a revolution for all the boyfriends. Why are you doing this? You ask why? Look there, half of the boys from the first row till the last row are those who were dumped. Please friends... At least, you tell these guys in an understandable way. He won't reform. Well... What gifts did he give you? What? All of these? There is one more. What? The dress she is wearing was a gift from him. Have you literally sucked him up? Taking gifts is the birthright of women. Why would I desist it? [phone ringing] Look, it's that rascal calling me. Hello Oye! Have you packed all the gifts? I will share the location on your Whatsapp, come and get them yourself. Hello! I came to you when I have gifted them. So you should come to me when you are giving them back. Huh! What's with this waiting under the hot sun? How long should do we have to wait? Wait for five minutes. He has arrived. Why is she here? Why is he here? Shooting another prank video? Where have you placed the camera? -Nothing like that. -Hang on, mate. Do you think boyfriends are like beer bottles to use and dispose them? Huh! At least, a beer bottle would have value but not you. Wow! See who is talking about values? You need Ameerpet guys to love you but US-return guys to marry! Hmph! Look, let me tell you something which you shall remember. Counting on a green card holder would ruin you! Instead, count on Aadhar card holders like me, you'll progress in life. Is it a poor joke? Why can you only remember the gifts that you gave me, but not the gifts that I gave you? What did you actually give me? Whenever I ask you for something, you'd say you'd give it post-marriage and you haven't even kissed me. Stop it, guys! When things don't work out, you have to talk and call off the relationship with mutual understanding. But not by quarrelling like this. You can take all the gifts back. But can you really take back the memories? One should always end a relationship on a better note, not on a bitter note. Don't demean love by calling off the relationship out of your ego. It doesn't look like a bachelor's house? Look at that picture, I think he is already married. Don't you talk in a jinxing manner. Move... Abhi... Abhi... Abhi... I am sure he must be married since his house is well-maintained. Will you shut up? -Abhi... -Hey... Who are you? How come you've entered inside without knocking? What I have expected is correct indeed. Oye! Why have you been talking among yourselves when I'm questioning you? Well... Who you are? I'm the sister of the one who you have been calling. Ah! Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... Hey, what's with your monkey's act? Why aren't you answering who you are? My name is Megha. Height: 5.5 feet. Weight: 55 kilograms. I have black hair and my skin tone is fairer than Tamannah. Oh really! Well... What might the work you have with Abhi? One side love. Please help me, sister-in-law. Hmm... What do you do? I work for a TV channel. I'm not asking about your job. It's about household work. Come on, ask me. I'll do anything you say. You will have to clean the entire house, will you? Cleaning? Ah! Okay. -Get me a Dosa. -[pan sizzling] Here, I'm bringing it. Tea, please. Ready. Wash the clothes. I am gone. These are the minimum qualifications for any girl to become a daughter-in-law. By the way, why do you like Abhi? He's got justification for his anger and social responsibility. He's the one who was very worried when a stranger girl got abducted. No girl cannot stop her liking a guy with such a character. Your brother respects the women in the way how we respect our national flag. What else can a girl expect? Guys like him can be found in a very number in the current society. He is a rare kind. That's why I need you to help me approaching him. Hmm... You need to first know Abhi in order to approach him. Do something... Stay with us so you can get to know him better. Stay in house? Only if I say so! [gasps] Hey... "A dream has landed in front my eyes like this" "Your pleasure blinked and dashed into my heart" Dad, she is Laxmi's relative, she will stay with us for a week. Hey! What are you doing here? -I am sorry. -Oh! Hold this. "You've shown the first sunrise and moved my heart" "You've made me know that you are my dream," "You've opened the doors of my heart" "filled yourself in it like a temple" "and have built my focus on you" "You've entwined our bond and started a never breaking with a journey with you" "You disturbed me asking me to know your destination" "You've created a never-ending tide and a never-ending sweet story" "Look here, it said to me when I was standing far away" "I'm running to get into your heart" "I'm carrying your thoughts all over with me" "I'm living with breathing just your thoughts" I wished for another daughter too. -Seems like my wish got fulfilled by you. -What? What is she talking? Uncle... Tea. Is this guy looking good? If you like him... What's this, sister-in-law? Your mother is considering me as daughter and your father is thinking of getting me married. Are you in love with my son? Yes, aunty. "Carrying your silence within me" "With my life kept within you" "You're making my body float in the breeze" "You made my smile reside in my eyes" "And you've filled my heart with magic" "Look here, it said to me when I was standing far away" "I'm running to get into your heart" "I'm carrying your thoughts all over with me" "I'm living with breathing just your thoughts" "A new world has blossomed in my heart" "My whole body is flourished with an autumn" "Coming close, lotuses have blossomed" "And showered fragrances of breeze" Suma... Please get up. [machine blips] [gasping] [gasping stops] [machine blips] -Please wait. -Doctor... I am sorry. She is in coma. The doctor wants to see you. Meet him in the upstairs. -Abhi, you go and meet him. -Okay. I'll go. [door creaks open] [vrooming sound playing from mobile] Doctor... Since her immune system is weak, her body couldn't take it and went into coma. This is a common complication in the treatment. The patient might recover in a month or a year or she might even die too. [glass cracking] Why are you over-reacting? She is not dead yet, right? [glass shatters] We visit hospitals because we consider them as temples and doctors as Gods. [door opens] Hey! The one who saves lives is considered as doctor, not the ones who play with it. [groans] Pull him up. -Hey, get up... -Hey, get up... Move... Sir... Sir... I didn't do any mistake. Hey, just keep moving. Move... Abhi? Abhi... Get in. Is this what you do when you are asked to do a job? Greetings, sir. Hey Abhi... Sir... He considers his sister as very dear to him. He did that in the heat of the moment. Hey, I did not arrest him for the brawl in hospital. Then, what is it, sir? -She is no more. -[sobbing] Oh no! My daughter! I am sorry, madam. What happened? I nicked my sister's pills that were given to her at a beauty contest. [coughs] I have distributed to all my friends at the school dance programme. While we were dancing on the stage, I felt a lot of pain in the abdomen and fell unconscious. I can't remember what happened after that. What is this? Abhi Did the father and son get clarity now? I have arrested him for supplying drugs in the beauty pills. Sir, I am just an ordinary area manager. I've distributed this product in the very way how I distribute every other product. It's my job, sir. There is nothing more I know about this product. Are you fooling around with me? You've been working there since two years but you claim you're not aware of this. Do you think the police are fools to believe you? Narayana, I hope you are not involved in all of these. Sir... We've been enquiring since three days to trace out who is behind this and where this product is being manufactured. But we could not find any legal evidence. You son is the only evidence we found. Now, you want us to release him? Careful, son. Abhi, who has been accused for supplying drugs in beauty pills causing death of two women and hospitalising several women should be taken into remand for one week. And also, the police department should gather the complete details of this case and submit it in the court. [thunders rumble] How is sister, Dad? She is still in the same condition. Come. "As God thought that one mom is not enough for us" "he has blessed us with another woman in our family" "She's carried her cute little brother" "and took great care of him" "She turned a horse in the play time" "Our happiness touched the sky" "She conceals what she likes and ensures that her brother gets what he likes" When did your slipper get torn? Here is the money, buy a new pair while going. "You are the mother-cum-sister" "You're the one who accompanies me like a father" "A sister is an epitome of affection" I would given you money again if you'd have told me that you lost money. See, how your feet is filled with sores. "A sister is one eye and the brother is another eye" "When a dust particle gets into one eye, both eyes get tears" "A sister is a heart and the brother is its heartbeat" "No matter wherever or whenever it is, the heart beat won't stop" "When my sister is behind me, I'd never feel any pain" "A sister is the one who'd even cry like a baby to make her brother happy" "As God thought that one mom is not enough for us" "he has blessed us with another woman in our family" "She turned a horse in the play time" "Our happiness touched the sky" "She conceals what she likes and ensures that her brother gets what he likes" "You are the mother-cum-sister" Son... "You're the one who accompanies me like a father" Mom, this is all because of me. "A sister is an epitome of affection" "She's a sweet swing who sings lullaby" Abhi, even I would have admitted Suma in this hospital. First, think of things to be done to get out of the case. Hmm... No one can investigate your son's case better than you. So, you should be dealing with this case. There is a saying, when things are going well, they'd have a great son. And our Narayana indeed got a great son who's been getting cash! He preaches us honesty and sincerity which he doesn't follow. [music over voice] Hey Srinu... [music over voice] [music over voice] Abhi... I've enquired all the girls who took beauty pills. They said they get severe abdominal pain as soon as they take those pills. When the contact the toll free number provided on the box, they were advised to visit the hospitals they have suggested. The hospitals admit them for two days in the name of treatment and discharge later. I think either because of the free treatment or the complimentary gifts provided by the hospital no one has ever complained. But I couldn't able to find what's the composition of drugs in those pills and what's happening in those hospitals. -All of you hurry up. Clean it up. -Ok, bro. -Keep all these there, make it fast. -Okay, bro. We're running short of time. -Why are you making it late, ladies? -It's almost done, sir -[camera clicks] Change them fast. -Okay, sir. What are you staring at? Make it fast. Guys, hurry up. Hey! What is going on here? Hey... [groans] [groans in pain] [shatters] [glass shatters] [glass shatters] [groans] [glass shatters] [tyres screech] Hey! What are these medicines and drugs? Tell me who is running your group! Come on! Tell me now! [groaning in pain] [groaning in pain] Abhi! He is getting away with something! [siren wailing] [siren wailing] [unclear recorded confirmation] Dad... watch this... [groans] [blipping sounds] [computers blipping] [blipping sounds] COMPUTER: Ovulation levels normal Anesthesia levels dropping. [hyperventilating] COMPUTER: EKG pulse abnormal. [hyperventilating] COMPUTER: EKG active. [hyperventilating] [hyperventilating] [groaning in pain] COMPUTER: EKG pulse level arising. COMPUTER: EKG pulse normal range. Stephen... Done. -Peter? -Okay. COMPUTER: Formula successfully locked. Yes! [scoffs] Success! Grand success! [laughs] [applause] Ten years. Number of failures. 60 thousand studies and a lot of research. [sighs heavily] I won. I won over the god who wanted to stop human birth. I've created an alternate nature. OK Abhi... I will stay outside. OK, careful! -No entry, sir! -OK. -Yeah, keep moving. -OK. -Which way? -Come fast! Quick! Give me that injection. Cotton... HCL? Please roll... -Abhay... -Tell me. They gave her some injection and she lost consciousness. Move fast! Abhi, right there. Shift, quickly. -Is everything ready for the treatment? -One second... Listen... Almost ready! Why do you take stress, just for this? I will take care. The Japan project on 4th August... Take care of that. Yeah, I forgot about it. But be careful! They are here for the first time. We need to take care of them. Security! -Morning, sir. -Did you see? -No, sir! -Search! Ok, sir. -Come on. -OK. Sir, they have gone missing. What I fear has happened. Shivaji shouldn't know about this. Megha... Megha bear it, please. -Go go. -Megha, we are here. Sir... Get her on to the bed. HCL formula! We don't get this in the market. Don't worry. She'll be alright with an antidote. I saw both the reports. The drug in the beauty pill and the drug they gave her, both are the same. What will they do to you? Generally girls get ovulation between 12 to 14. With this drug, fertile eggs get released, not caring about the periods. Some can handle this drug and some can't. Younger girls might also die. -Hello! -Formula HCL injection. If you give it to a ten-year-old girl... -What will happen, sir? -Hey, who are you? Daddy, please come fast. -My baby... -Within five minutes... Come to the location I shared. Or else... What's happening in the hospital? What's the relation between the hospital and Superstar Sivaji? I am asking you... We all know Sivaji as an actor. He's not just an actor. We are from the same college. Morning, Sivaji. Same college... Same room... But he used to be in a different world. His mind is a pandora box. Thought is like laser and his answer is bull's eye. Like sage Vishwamitra and like Einstein in science. Like a split person medically... He used to behave so differently. One day in our final year... We don't know how his body might react. -I want to know that. -Hey, no! -God! BP will be above 160. -Yes. -Pulse will be dropping. -It did. There will be foam from his mouth. -Yes. -He'll be dead in just 5 seconds. As I used methanol, his hypertension increased... And died of cardiac arrest. So, morphine 10 mg instead of methanol. And propranolol 25 mg will make this formula success. He completed MBBS and joined for MS in the same college. The degree changed, but not his behaviour. He used to experiment a lot. Right then, Avika fell for him. Where is this genius. -OK. -Mix up with... -Hi. -I love you, Shiva. Love? According to neuroscience... Everything you think and do... The brain will process it as neuro chemical and neuro-electrical... Because of that, a biochemical reaction occurs in your body... A feeling got developed, and you gave it a name... -Love. -What? Shiva... Shiva, other than these books and experiments... You never think of me. I know how to give you feelings. Shiva... In the place of chemical reaction... A biological reaction started, right? Your left breast is sagging 2cm, compared to your right. That's because of protein deficiency during your formation in the womb. Because of this, as you age, the pulmonary veins blood supply... ...decrease to the heart and the coronary vein will be blocked. So in the next 7 years. You might get a stroke. Change the diet and workout everyday. Use these tablets and you'll be alright. Let me teach you a lesson. Shiva... "My life has turned into a garland..." "Only after seeing you..." "My legs are taking me towards you..." "But nowhere else..." "My heart ..." "It's you..." "It's changing into you, in a sweet tune." "We are not different..." "We have been one since many lives." "My heart has been waiting for you." "My eyes are smiling in silence." "My life has turned into a garland..." "Only after seeing you..." "Every cell knew this life..." "They will always remember you..." "This world is full of your fragrance." "This beautiful journey is proving it." "We are not different." "We have been together since many lives." "My heart is waiting for you." "My eyes are smiling in silence." "My life has turned into a garland..." "Only after seeing you..." -Reddy... -One minute... Her husband will leave her if she's not fertile. Her life will get ruined. Please help her. You can't understand? There are no eggs being released in her womb. Even God can't help. Leave! -I beg you. -Please leave. Don't waste my time. He wants to re-write his fate and the future of medical science. But not by a vaccine to viruses or answer to cancer... He wanted to re-creat God's creation. He created a formula, for eggs not being released. Generally humans chase success. But success used to chase him. But this time... First model of geeks, 1964. Nuclear magnetic resonance, 1966. Discovery of quasicrystals, 1984. These researches are rejected first. -Then they got Nobel. -Calm down, Shiva! Not with research papers, but you'll get approval only with a recommendation. The one thing a scientist should have is zeal. You have that and your invention will be known to the world someday. [phone rings] Hello? His father, who's a Superstar by then... Our MGR is no more... Falling ill during a shoot and taking treatment in a private hospital... He took his last breath. Telugu Film Industry is stunned by this. The producers who paid him advance is asking for that money. I see no other way but for you to get launched as a hero. His father fans followed him... And he became a Superstar overnight. [song playing on screen] -Super! -Great movie! I feel no doubt in saying that Sivaji is like my family. The world is changing. Let us also change. Shop in Paytm mall and get cashback. Even if he's having a royal life, full of movies in his hands... He kept on thinking about making that formula a success. Because of the radiation effect in Japan... And infertility in women, a generation gap occured. He saw that on news. Due to the radiation effect, the women in this country is facing infertility. Not just Japan, but the entire world according to the numbers. At least, 11% of the women population are facing the same problem. -Yeah. -Yeah. I have a solution for this. If an organ gets damaged... We implant someone else's organ. Because of the eggs not getting released properly... The ladies who are facing infertility... We can implant eggs from those who are healthy. We can make them conceive naturally. -Thanks! -Your theory is excellent. -What about the donors? -We have a lot of donors in India. -That I can handle. -Nice! But we need some practical proof. Bring a report of hundred successful cases... Then we can sign the contract. As they accepted the theory, he looked for practicle proof. The first clinical trails is on... We have been married so long and we don't have kids... You too have the egg release functioning problem... Why shouldn't we start the trails with you? Don't you believe my formula? I believe in you. No. Bear it! God! It's OK... God! Sivaji... Modifying his formula, he made me setup a fertility hospital... He cashed the emotions of those who come with infertility... And started clinical trails on them. Though may died... He never stopped. Sivaji... As he is a Superstar, with the support of some big-shots... The cases of those who died... He managed to hide them. What's with beauty pills, kidnaps and circle app? He organized beauty contests to collect eggs in huge quantity... Supplied drugs in the name of beauty pills. He made them come to our chain of hospitals. We stole eggs. Through educational fest and sports meet... We collected the details of girls. Through circle app, we made them meet with accidents and collected their eggs. With the formula we have then, there are conceiving... But the fetus is not living nine months. To rectify this... We made clinical tests on your sister, with a rare blood group. The formula that almost got successful, failed due to a small mistake. And your sister went into coma. The beauty pills case came out at the same time and we used you as a shield. After that, we rectified the formula... And he final became successful. For every one of us, the first God is the mother. It's a blessing to any woman. But they have made it a business deal, sir. The women who came to become mothers... They bluff them and make clinical trials on them, sir. We go to hospitals if we fall ill. But if the hospitals creat that illness? What will a common man be? After studying the case... I order police to take Superstar Sivaji into custody. And make him attend the court. OK, sir. -Ramya, I am coming to hostel.-What happened, Megha. -I'll tell you when I come. Bye!-Megha... Megha, what are you doing here? -I'll go to Abhi. -Where to? Everything is set and everyone is happy. There's no more reason for me to stay. Do you think we can be happy without you? The ones I love in my life are mom, sister... And you... How can I leave you, Megha? Really? Sure? "God, this cute girl gave me a fever." "It's been burning me." "God, this boy is looking me with naughty eyes..." "He's playing with me cheeks." "She's tying me with beauty." "She's pulling me smiles." "He made some magic, making me look for him all the time." "She's been following me and making me sleepless." "He looks like he's going to eat me." "She's been sitting in my heart and now I can't get her out." "He made magic with his words and changed my mind." "She's been here by force..." "She took over me..." "He's been a sweet fever, that I don't want to leave." "She's been following me and making me sleepless." "Oh, God! This guy has taken over my heart." "Such a powerful eyes." "Look at the way he looks at me..." "He came like a thunder..." "He's been peeping at me and made me go mad." "She sat in front of me and made me go crazy." "He took over my life..." "He made my mind swirl..." "She entered my heart and is killing me." "She's been following me and making me sleepless." [commotion] The fans say that these are false statements and are making a mess in anger. Common mas is facing a lot of trouble because of this. [hailing Sivaji] 144 section in Kukatpally. Police are on high alert. [commotion] Abhi, you leave. Where is Sivaji right now? This is the report for 100 case studies. We are successful. -Let's sign the agreement. -OK. Wait. Chaos errupts in the city of Hyderabad. -What is this? -Sivaji conducted illegal clinical trials. -On innocent women. -You said you have legal donors. -What's this nonsense? -There must be some mistake. They are doing this to become overnight famous. Please give me five days. I'll clear all this. -Five days. Then we'll sign the contract. -OK. -Thank you. -See you soon. See you! Hurt me and I willl recover. But I can't tolerate my fans being bad. You are not goons. You have to help society. Don't think I am silent as I don't have the answer. This is not just the time to talk. My dear fans... Be calm. I am on my way! Because of the allegations of Superstar Sivaji... We all know there are orders for him to attend the court. As per our lead, Sivaji is going to come here soon. Thinking of what might happen and what verdict might come out... -Everyone is waiting eagerly. -[commotion] [hailing Sivaji] Mr. Sivaji, what's your answer to the allegations on you? They are not allegations. They are lies. Your honour... Those clips are the visuals of a reality show. It's a show that focuses on loop holes in corporate hospitals. I am just an actor in it. -Permission to question the witnesses. -Yes. Granted. Morning, sir. I directed this reality show. -I am the producer. -I gave the script. Finally the hospital MD, Mr Ravindra. -Tell us. -Superstar Sijavi is my friend, sir. As he asked me permission for a shoot, I said OK. But that man created it as a reality to escape the drugs case. He kidnapped my daughter and blackmailed me... And made me tell things. After studying the case... I believe that Sivaji has nothing to do with this case. We are letting him go. If Abhi fails to prove himself not guilty in the coming seven days... I order the police to take him into custody. "Rama is the God who took life as a human." "Ravana thinks that he's God but he's evil." "Parasurama is the son who killed his mother." "Lord Brahma is the creator..." "Viswamitra is the re-creator..." "Karna grew up surrounded by bad fate." It's a slow blow, but it hurt bad, right? But hats off to your intelligence. [hailing Sivaji] The medical kingdom I built over the years... You exposed it along with evidence. Great! All your hardwork went to waste. This is what I am. From the one who made the law to the one who carries it... Everyone is my men... Look at Superstar Sivaji fans. If I give a little sign... You'll be no more! Superstar Sivaji is not just a person. He is a system. Anyway, you did a good job. Selfie? Come come. "Who the damn am I..." "Who the damn am I..." "Who the damn am I..." "Who the damn am I..." "Who the damn am I..." "Who the damn am I..." "Who the damn am I..." "Who the damn am I..." "Who the damn am I..." "Who the damn am I..." "Who the damn am I..." "Who the damn am I..." "Who the damn am I..." "Who the damn am I..." "Who the damn am I..." Sivaji... What's this? What is that breaking news? The trails in the hospitals and court cases... Your dad wanted you to be a great star. -What is this? -Only you and dad have dreams? You don't care about my dreams? I have become a Superstar only for you and dad. But I want to be a great scientist. That's why this research. On whom and what? Do you have any idea? A woman's body is like a temple... The womb is even more pure. A woman dies every time a change occurs in it, do you know that? In the name of a scientific revolution, your brains are ruling your hearts. You are leading to destruction. To all the humans... Every scientist gives a great invention. I am also like Alexander Fleming and Einstein. For millions of lives to be better... Hundreds of lives should be paid. All the women who give life, using this formula... They will talk high about this great scientist. Leave about their lives and learn about your life first. Do you know how you are born? God gave man the chance to give life... He gave woman the luck to raise it. But he took that luck away from me. You are the top gynecologist in the world and you too don't have an answer? We have a solution. It's called surrogacy. You'll be the biological parents, but... Your baby will grow in someone else's rented womb. -How is it possible? -This is the 1980s, sir. -Things have changed. -Yes. Science has advanced a lot. You may feel this new. But... In the next 30 years, not just celebrities like you... It will be available to a common man too. Who is that lady? Mary... -Are you alright? -Yeah. Upper abdominal disfunction. High cholesterol symptoms are the causes of cardiac arrest. Stop kicking me. I know you are listening. Prevention is better than cure. Nonsense! A cure is the only way to prevent disease. Any kid wants to be close to the mother. But you have been away from me. And have been lonely. You felt a doll better than your mother. I am just your mother. You would have got me if I gave birth to you. This is limbic imprinting. When he's inside her, her behavior will affect him. Genetically the kid might get them all. [phone rings] Hello! What? Are you surprised that the Superstar called you? You have sent me a story, right? I'll tell you the climax for it. Olympic champion Indu... She's starting from the academy, in a 9997 car. I hope you know what will happen next. Decide if you want to lose this... Or win this as my fan... I'll see! Yes! Brother, he's here again. The police helped him last time. But now? Give me the rod. You made our God to attend the court? -You... -Hit me here and I'll die. But listen to me once and decide. -Tell me. -Our Superstar is in danger. The F-club is planning to attack him. 100s are ready to kill him. We won't see him if we don't save him now. -Is this true? -Why will I come to you at all? Are you confused with my words nor suiting my actions? All that you see is not true. Anything can happen at anytime. Brother... Ambulance... The bullet hit the left ventricle. Blood loss... And I can't breathe. Sivaji... Sivaji... Sivaji... Sivaji... I can't connect at least now, mom! You are crying and I am smiling. What is this? Thanks. You introduced a new version of me to myself. I thought I have a defect in me. My birth itself is a defect. I thought I was born to my mother... I was born to a scientifiic experiment...Sivaji... The defect I was born with... I invented medicine for the same? Then I have decided... For all the women who wants to be a mother. My formula should be a miracle. -But... -Have you gone mad? How did you become so good all of a sudden? -Sign this first. -Tell me the amount and I'll payback. -I will never sign it. -What? You'll pay the money back? Your circle app, accidents, clinical trails... Court cases... I saved you everywhere. Now you are warning me? He says he'll pay, right? -Hey! -Stop! Sivaji, we are getting late. Let's go! You'll have life only until we are friends. Leaving our club is like dying. Hey, don't leave them. I remembered you right then... That's why I called you. She's in 9997 car. With the help of you, I came to the Central Drugs Board. I requested them to give my formula to the trust. No woman should fail from being a mother. The respect I pay for every mother is this Marshal formula. Please... Accept it! The F-club may stop this. That's why I have got proof for all their illegal activities. Submit this in the court. Make this formula help everyone. Your favorite hero's... Last wish... Will you fulfill it? "Lord Krishna to the Dwapara Yuga." "Lord Sri Rama to the Treta Yuga." "They took birth in all the needy times..." "And saved the people..." "That God in these times..." "I was just thinking he's not here yet..." "I have got strength and courage..." "The God showed you to me." "You are one for this yuga..." "Our hopes took life here..." "Women are not just dolls..." "You are one for this yuga..." "Our hopes took life here..." "Women are not just dolls..." "You prved that every woman is a mother." "You are one for this yuga..." "Our hopes took life here..." "Women are not just dolls..." "You prved that every woman is a mother." He gave hope to all the women who can't be mothers... Not just to Telugu states, Sivaji is a scientist... ...the whole country should be proud of. Sivaji's name being in the list given out by Nobel committee. It is definitely a proud moment for us all. "Mom, the life you gave me..." "It is the greatest gift to me..." "Mom, if there is another life..." "I will come back as your son again." "Mom, the life you gave me..." "It is the greatest gift to me..."
