I tell you what. There's no way am I ever going to buy that cap. Who's your tour guide? I got stuck with Harry again. He's gonna want you to wear the cap. Well, he's been wanting for two years and it hasn't happened yet. Ah, man! They just got it out of the wash. We'll be lucky if we get out of here by noon. I'll be lucky if I make it to Vegas by ten. Which show's this one in? "Lido de Paris". Whooee! Finishes her first show at 9:30 and doesn't start her next one until 11:00. Any reason why you couldn't meet her after the 11:00 show? No reason at all, except... that's when her regular boyfriend and all his buddies show up. You're living dangerously again. Yeah, well, I learned a long time ago you gotta take some chances in this life. And, where women are concerned it's best to take those chances sooner than later. Golden West Tours? -Right this way. -Thank you very much. Friends, on behalf of Golden West I want to welcome you to our Adventurers' Club tour to Las Vegas. Those of you who generally travel by air are in for a scenic delight. Just think. The money you saved by not flying, you can lose at the gambling tables. My name is Harry Edwards. I'm your tour director and resident wit. Oh, I can see that you people are going to have a wonderful time together. I filled out name tags for everyone. That's just in case during the trip you have a lapse of memory and you forget who you are. I want you all to wear the name tags because we are going to be together for three days and the sooner we get to know one another, the more fun we can have. And that's what this trip is all about. Fun. Okay. Mr. and Mrs. Brain. -Russ and Debbie Baker. -Here. All right, here. Here you are. Okay, this must be Debbie. This must be Russ. Janet and Forrest Devlin. Hi, honey, it's me. Hi, love, what did you forget? I didn't forget anything. What is it, then? Just wanted to check. You sure you don't want me to come on home, we catch a late flight to Vegas? Do you good to get away. Let's just skip this one, Martin. Come on, you know I'm not that crazy about Las Vegas. At least we'd be together. There will be other trips. Have a good time, lose a few bucks gracefully and call me the minute you get in. I miss you already. I miss you. Safe journey. He's not going to leave the ranch all weekend. So far, so good, I guess. Will you stop it! Nobody's expecting us to catch a bus. And I doubt that too many of the people we know travel this way. You having second thoughts? No, I waited too long. In just a few moments we'll be boarding our bus. So if any of you have any last-minute freshening-up to do or you want to buy magazines or cigarettes, now would be the time. -Where is she? -Who's she? Oh, it's you. Makes it a perfect day. I had two couples from the Kiwanis cancel at the last moment, my regular photographer is sick and he's sending a girl who never worked a tour in her life. Yeah, and I'm your driver. Smile, Harry, that's what they pay you for. -Where's your cap? -In the bus. Hey, good afternoon, girls! You know, I thought for one terrible moment, there you were going to take somebody else's bus. You girls must be Peggy Cameron and Irene Martin. I'm Harry. This is Lee, the driver. Oh! Does this look all right? It looks terrific. Come on, girls, let me help you find a seat so you can see what's going on. I'm supposed to assign the seats. Never can be too safe when it comes to money. Oh, that's us honey. Listen, buy a magazine. I'll trade with you during the trip. Final call for Golden West Deluxe Tours. Okey-dokey! Some lucky lady is going to win free tickets to Las Vegas for she and her hubby. Get your raffle ticket before you get on board. What if you aren't married? This is for couples only. Oh. Singles, on the return trip. Ah, you're a nice boy. -Mr. Edwards? -Yes? What happened to the group picture that was mentioned in the brochure? Well, there's been a change in plans. We're going to take pictures on board the bus. Oh. Sounds like a rip-off to me. It does. Mr. and Mrs. Brain. -How y'all? -Fine, fine. Welcome on board. Ah! Here's one for you, Mrs. Baker. -Thank you. -Very good. And here's one for you. That's very nice for you. Okay. You don't get one, you're single. Single people don't get one. On the way back, you get one. -Sarah, it won't go. -Oh, it's got to go, Lenore. You need some help? Maybe if... Oh, that's very clever! Thank you! Could we interest you in a game of Pitty Pat later? Ah, no thanks. Oh. Well, whatever. If I were 20 years younger... You'd still be old enough to be his mother. Deal the cards. Just shuffle the cards. -Hello! -Hello! -And one for you. -Thank you. -John Finch. -Oh, yes, sir. We didn't think you'd make it. I won't need a name plate. Oh, yes, you see, but everybody's wearing them. It's the one way that we get a chance to... See you in Vegas. Well, I make it 28 fun-seekers this time around, Harry. Your four Kiwanis people and two other no-shows are missing. Yeah, but we're still waiting for the photographer. Harry, I got a schedule to make, you know. This isn't a commuter! -Come on, Harry! -Wait up. Hold it, Lee. -Mr. Edwards? -That's right. Fred called me this morning. He was very ill with bronchitis, so I'm going to take his place. He called you this morning? It is now 12:30. I had a wedding this morning. I'm terribly sorry. All right. Get on board. Take the seat right next to the driver, here. We'll discuss the kind of shots that you're going to take. All right? Memories are a very important part of this business. People look at the pictures you took. They decide they had a good time and they come back. Harry, you got to be seated when I'm backing up. Regulations. You're right. Please be seated. Hey, look. I'm sorry I was late. You're forgiven. -Pitty Pat! -Good, good. Take in the money. Let's deal another hand. Let's get the cards together. Oh, it's closed. You know, he's kinda cute. Who's kinda cute? The ball player? Well, he's not bad, but I meant the driver. The bus driver? Oh! He's handsome! He's a handsome bus driver. Just what you want to find in Vegas. Look, will you stop it. It's not the kind of thing where we're standing on a street corner swinging our purses. It's all yours. Pitty Pat! How about that? My, it's getting monotonous, isn't it? I hope my luck changes in Vegas. Bus 481 now departing for Jerome, Prescott and Phoenix through gate 12. Howdy. I'm from Comco. I'm here to run a service check on your 949. - Charlie. - Sure. This may take a few minutes. No problem. Hey, Charlie! While you're up, why don't you hit the air conditioner, will you? It's not even hot. What are you, on some kind of energy-saving kick? Come on! Are you any good with that? Oh, I've won some awards. I'll be taking a tour down to Mazatlan in a couple of months. If you do good on this assignment, I'll put in a word for you. Well, it's nice of you to offer, but this is not exactly my field. Golden West is a great company. I've been with them for 11 years. Freedom. That's the key. No one stands over your shoulder telling you what to do. No desk job for Harry Edwards. No, sir. Give me the open road any day. Harry! How about a picture? Okay, honey. Be right there. Do I take a picture of the driver, too? Oh, thanks for the thought, but I think that will do. Say, welcome to Golden West. You know, if you have any questions, I'll be... Hey, thanks, but I'm just passing through. Oh, on your way to bigger and better things, huh? Well, it's not a bad way to kill a weekend. I'll get the 11-year veteran his pictures and enjoy the fresh air and the sunshine. Then, as you say, it's onward and upward. Did I say something wrong, driver? No. You just put it all in perspective for me. See, I've been going along with the simple-minded idea that, when you take the company's money, no matter what the job is you do the best job you know how. No talking to the driver. Oh, come on, Harry, that's out of the old ages. I'm out of the old ages. Come on. Sheila wants to have her picture taken. I'm ready! Right there. There you are. Does that look all right? It doesn't look too posed, huh? Not at all. Not at all. - Is this okay? - Excellent. Go ahead. Take some more. -Let's try one sitting down. Wait a minute, wait a minute. - Beautiful! - Skirt's not too high? Keep shooting. I wonder if anybody's going to see these. I see it, but I don't believe it. The blonde hair? It's really a wig. I saw her hiding money underneath it. -Seriously? -Really. Maybe I should wear one. I always hide mine in my socks. -How long will it take? -It'll take me five minutes. How long since you checked those tires, Huh? You get off my case, now. You ain't the man. You fix the tire, and I'll buy you the five minutes. Good, good. All right. Now we'll get this group down here. All right, here we go. Get ready for a shot. Smiling faces... Oh, no. Skip the picture. Mr. Finch, everybody in the group gets a picture. If you don't want to wear a name tag, that's all right. But, if you don't want a picture, try the john. -Okay? -Well, it's your bus. Okay. Come one, everybody, smile. Get ready for the picture. Smile. All right, now. Move down this way. Let's get... Come on. Good, good. Get together, together. Come on, baby. Let's get out of here. Lee! Excuse me, excuse me. Lee! Lee? What happened? Some joker in a dune buggy. What are we going to do now? Well, I think we're stuck, but I think I can rock us out. All right. Stay calm, everybody, stay calm. It was just some practical joker. Everything's under control. Nothing to worry about. How about a big hand for the driver. Okay? Yeah. I think I can make it. The funny thing is, those guys were behind us for the last 20 miles in those dune buggies. Listen, what if I opened the champagne up now? How about that? Yes, let's have the champagne now. Okay. All right. Champagne for everybody! We're going to have to start another game. We'll just start over. I think I was winning, wasn't I? Well, no, we're going to have to start a whole new game. No, never. Never. All right. Oh, no, sir. None for me. Are you in training? That stuff is bad for your liver, Harry. Jocks. Oh, no. We have our distilled water. Thank you. I hope it's a good year. Some for you over here. Well, it certainly was nice of you to play cards with those old ladies. Those old ladies just took me for 60 bucks. I'm sure it's against the Golden West rules to offer the driver a drink. It is, but thanks for the thought. Look, I apologize if I came on a little flip before. Apologize? Refresh my memory. Just what did you say? Well, I kind of implied that I was a hot-shot photographer just doing all you people a favor by keeping the camera in focus. You mean you aren't going to get us on the cover of Life magazine? Well, I wouldn't look for it this month but, sooner or later, it's going to happen. But in no way did I mean to put down what anybody else did for a living. Look, you're trying to save some feelings that ain't never been hurt, Alicia. I drive this bus because doing so pays me $395 a week. I drive this route because four nights out of seven it puts me in Vegas where three forms of diversions have been refined to the highest. Drinking and gambling, I enjoy moderately. The third... You're really saying that's all there is to it? You just go for the good times early and stay out late? What else is there? Not with hands! You don't hold hands! Your newlyweds. That's better. That's better. Come on. Now, that's the shot you're taking. Feels like it's going to be a hot one today, Fred. Yeah, we need temperatures in the 80s. Well, you take care. I'll catch you on the rebound. Okay. Take care, drive safe. Back on the bus already? You must be in a hurry to get to Vegas. Yeah, well, that's where it's at, huh? You must spend a lot of time there. You don't? Well, every once in a while when I was a kid, with my folks. And then sometimes when I was married. But now, with my own kids, I... It's not so easy. Well, that's what Peggy is doing now. Checking with the sitter we got for both sets. Well you're young, you deserve a chance to get away. Yeah, everyone's got to get away once in a while. Howdy. Hi. Just take any seat that's open, okay? Excuse me, is this seat taken? Oh, yes. I'm sorry. Oh, so am I. I'm going to do exactly what I want. You are not going going to tell me what to do. I don't care what you say, Lenore. Look what I got! Hey, I'm sorry, buddy, but passengers aren't allowed up front. Turn off the highway. Don't be stupid. Let's go. Where? Into the desert. We're going south. What's going on? All right, turn around slow. I have a gun. Lay it down. Okay, everybody, sit tight. Relax. We're going to take a slight detour. What kind of animals are you? Sit down! Don't you dare order me. You don't frighten us. Listen buster. I'm 67 years old and, if I believed my doctor 10 years ago I'd have been dead. Please lady, give us all a chance to reach 67. Sit down! That's healthy advice. Keep your eyes front. You. Stand up. Come on. Get up here. Just her. Okay, up front. Move it. Put her right here. Okay, Mr. Tour Guide, up front. Hey. Neil? No, don't try to move. He can't lie here in the aisle any longer. Can you understand what I'm saying? Put your arm around my neck. Okay, that's it. That's it. I need someone to help! Here. Ma'am? Better take him to the back. Thank you. Take it easy with him. Now, Neil? Yeah, this is fine. Okay, chief, this is where I take over. Let's go. Look, buddy. You just tell me where you want to go and I'll drive. You really want to die right now? Okay. On the floor, chief. Let's go. Lie down there. Okay. I want these people lost. You got it, baby. Where are you taking us? California. Wouldn't you like to go to California? Come on! No, man! You're going to fool around once too often. Hey, what you gonna do, huh, man? You gonna change partners? Take the driver out. Over there. Time to go, Ms. Brain. Look. -You don't understand. -Come on! Out! I'm not Mrs. Brain! Let me go! Let me go! I'm not Mrs. Brain! Let me go! Put her in the buggy. Let me go! Well, what do you think, driver? We should pick the man in charge, trained to drive that bus, capable of leading those sheep that are sitting on their hands, and shoot him. But, then again, I'm not talking to the skipper of the Trident, am I? I'm talking to a nickel-and-dime bus driver between Albuquerque and Vegas. What would you do if you were me, driver? Keep 'em here. Keep 'em quiet. And you should be able to get home sometime. It seems a shame to leave you like this. Adios, everybody! I got a lot of money, here. Probably over $2000. I'll give you all of it not to take her. Thanks for the contribution. Now get back on the bus. You don't understand. She is not... -Stay where you are. -He was carrying a lot of money. There's gotta be more to be had on that bus. No one travels to Las Vegas with empty pockets. No question about that. What do you say, Neil? No. We got a schedule to follow. So did the bus. Well, we're 30 miles from nowhere. What's another minute or two? Get away from him! I want you to stand over there. Okay! You people get your luggage down and get off the bus. Now! Let's move it. Come on. You, too, Harry. Come on, move it! Quickly, people! Let's go! I want you to line up against the bus. Hurry up. Line up against the bus. I want you to move, and I mean right now. Oh. Ladies. Off the bus. I misjudged you, young man. Yeah, many women have, honey. Here you go. Let's go. Move it. Come on! Move it, move it. Let's go. Move! - Hoodlum! - Shut up, lady, huh? Okay. I want all you men to empty your pockets of wallets, jewelry, watches. All you ladies do the same thing with your purses. Drop your bags. I said drop them! What's the matter, honey? Left your shoes on the bus? Much better, huh? Barefoot in the sand. All right, you. Get him up. Get him out of here. He can't be moved. Well, just you then. Come on. Let's go, move it. Come on. With the others. Go. I don't want any of you people holding out on us, you understand? Yeah. Taking pictures? Get over there with the others! Okay, everybody. That wasn't so bad, was it? Everybody turn around and face the bus. But you already got everything we have. I've had about enough out of you. You open your mouth once more and Golden West just lost itself a tour guide. Get your hands up! Get against the bus! Gentlemen, take off your coats. Your shoes and your socks, too. Move it! Here you go, Larry. Don't forget that big blonde. She's got some money tucked up under that wig. No! No! Easy, driver. You're around the pass already. Let's go, Irene. No! Hey, wait a minute! Not this time, Neil. I left her before, but I'm taking her now. No! No! No! Leave her alone! You gonna stop me? The only difference between you and me is that gun. You're wasting time, now. Leave her! The only difference between us is the gun, huh? I don't think so. Star of the Michigan team, huh? -I played some. -I don't think so. I don't think this gun's the only difference between us. 'Cause even if you had it I don't think I'd do what you're going to do now. Get down on your knees. Down, I said! You'd do anything to keep life in that hulking body of yours, anything I say. Tell me you'd do anything! Yes! Whatever you say. All right, all right. Let's get out of here. Come on. Hey! We almost forgot. The 7204 from Albuquerque is late. You forgot. Old 949 came to life around noon. 7204's been canceled. Shall I double-check? Why not? Their last tour was at 3:15. They must have quit early. Good idea. Buy you a drink? Well, you may have a mild concussion. I bet you it hurts a lot. Better not move around too much, okay? Is he going to be all right? I think so. I'd better see about the guy on the bus. I'll see about the guy on the bus. Why were they after your wife? What is this all about? Yes, what is this all about? Please! Look. That can wait. I got to find out what shape this bus is in and try to figure out what we're going to do next. You don't have to do anything. Don't you think it would help a little if we knew why we were attacked in the first place? Yeah, Mr. Brain, why were they after your wife? Those men were after my wife because before we were married her name was Laura Madden. -Of the Madden Ranch? -That's right. The only thing is, they didn't get my wife. The girl that's with me is... Well, she's a very close friend of mine. Will you tell me why the son-in-law of the richest rancher in this part of the state is riding around on a bus? Does somebody have to tell you? He was shacking up. How's he doing? I don't know. He's conscious for a while, but then he drifts out of it again. Well, there will be someone here, soon. We're overdue in Flagstaff. They'll be checking on us. That's fine with me, but he's not bleeding very much. He's just coughing a little. What's wrong with that? Well, I'm not sure, but from everything that I remember from first-aid classes it's sometimes a symptom of internal bleeding. Careful! How is he? I'm no doctor. Well, let me tell you how I see it, and what I think we should do. First of all, they shot four of the six tires. Fortunately, they were in a hurry, so the two back-end side tires are undamaged. I say we should remove the four punctured tires repair the two least damaged, and put them in the front. Wait a minute! Before you get everybody panicked, let me say something. First, we are overdue in Flagstaff. We will soon be overdue in Kingman. If they're not looking for us yet, they soon will be. Yes, but suppose they don't find us by dawn. Yeah, we could all stay out here in the desert... All right. Hold it. Let's hold it down, huh? Okay, now. I don't want to wait for the company. Harry could be right. The Highway Patrol and helicopters they could be here in five minutes. But what if they're not. What if it's five hours? Or 50? You want to wait that long? No! Okay. All right. I'll tell you where we should start. If we're not found by night, we should build a fire. Good idea. It gets cold out. As far as the water's concerned, I think we should start conserving immediately. Why are you trying to upset these people over nothing? What about the man that was shot on the bus? That was nothing? No, I didn't mean that, Peggy. That was terrible. This whole thing has been a terrible experience, but it's over. The worst is over. -Excuse me, Mr. Edwards. -Yes, what is it? I'm a runner. I ran quite a bit in college, cross-country. Hey, wait a minute. We must be 25 or 30 miles from the freeway. I ran 26 miles in four hours last year in Boston. Hey, this is the desert. You make the wrong turn out there and we may never find you. I can make it. Thank you. We'll save that as an option, okay? All right. All right. Does anyone here know anything about electrical wiring? I know a little. How much is a little? Well, I used to be a lineman for the phone company. Well, that's enough for me. The electrical box is under the dashboard. All right. As soon as we see what the electrical system is all about I'll come back and we'll split up the rest of the work. All right? -Good idea. All right. -All right. Harry, you're not smiling. The company wouldn't like that. Look. I know they were pretty tough on you out there but sitting here thinking about it ain't gonna help. He had me down on my knees. Now, cut it out! Other people have gone through a lot worse and they've lived through it. So, stop moping, get up, and get out there with everybody else! Move! Why the hell didn't you say something back on the bus? Why didn't you say something back in the desert? I did try to! Back at the beginning when you called me up front. I heard her scream something about you having her wrong, Neil. Why didn't you get a picture of Brain's wife in the first place? Look. I got the tip four days ago that he and his wife were sneaking out to Vegas on a bus. That kind of trip, you don't take snapshots and road maps! Okay, okay! Let's divide up what we did get and get out of here, Neil. Now! -We can't do that. -Who the hell are you, anyway? My name is Joyce Landry. I work for the Department of Animal resources in the Albuquerque office. Mr. Brain... Martin used to come in for certain permits and licenses. -Over a period of a couple... -You got warm for each other, yeah. What about the guy with the gun? He work for the Brain Ranch, maybe? I never saw him before in my life. -Put her in the other room. -Sure thing. All right. Does anybody know how to work this? It hooks up on the support beneath the bus. Great! Yeah! You got it! Okay. We're going to take off the two rear outside tires and we'll patch up the least damaged of the other four and put them on the front. It'll never run on four tires. -Just give it a chance. -Oh, come on, Harry. It may wobble a little bit but I guarantee you, she'll run. Okay. Some of you guys can start loosening the lugs on the wheels, okay? I'd like to help if I can. Good, but take it easy. That's me. Grunt work is something I'm experienced at. Okay. We have to clear an area. Let's see. What about over here? Why don't we start getting some brush and some wood. We'll build a fire. We'll need it because it'll be cold tonight. And if there are some helicopters out, they'll see the flames. Okay. That's something the women can do. -Good. -Come on, let's spread out! Yeah, there's some women that can fix tires, you know. Excuse me. You okay? Oh, sure. Both my wig and my dignity are back in place. -I'm sorry about... -Don't be. I'm just glad to be alive. I know a couple of doctors who wouldn't have made bets on that a few months ago. You're going to be all right? You get one guarantee with chemotherapy. It's hell on the hair. Well, you look terrific to me. Thanks, Lee. Hey, track star! How's everything going? It's going all right. Hey, just how far did you run in Boston? 26 miles. Excuse me, Debbie. Do you think you could convince Elenore and Sarah to give up one of those bottles of distilled water? Let me talk to you, huh? 26 miles? That's right. Just a minute. Now you can have it. Ugh! That's straight vodka, I'll bet. Well, it was supposed to be a holiday! Let's see. Green over yellow... Well, there's not much more I can say that can help. The sun sets in the west. I figure we're south and maybe a little east of the freeway so it should be out there somewhere. I figured the same thing. Don't worry. I'll find it. Hey, good luck. And I'll see you later. I'll see you. Deb? It's all right. I've been watching you run ever since junior high school. I've never seen you lose. Well, there's not much more we can do today. Let's close it up, huh? Well, after that workout, I could use a glass of champagne. Hey, Harry? What about that raffle? Oh, yeah. I promised you a raffle, and you'll have it! You pick the winner. And the winner is... -Well? -Well? Come on! Come on, Harry. Who won? Peggy, you read it. What's the matter with him? Mrs. Martin Brain. -Oh, no. -Gee. Well, that's it for tonight. Let me try, I have to keep busy. I'll just keep working at it until I get tired. I'm sorry about what happened before. I still think the cavalry is going to be coming over the hill. I'm just shook and angry. You know, I think everybody was a little shook and angry. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. There have been births, heart attacks, even hurricanes. Natural calamities. You know, kidnapping and robbery, they're natural calamities. I never thought of it like that before. Well, start. It'll make you feel better. You know, on these tours, people have met, married, had families. I start writing my Christmas cards in July so I'm sure I don't miss anyone. That's a lot of cards. It's a lot of friends. They're my family. You know something, Harry? I never looked at it that way. You reneged. I did not! Yes, you did! Shh! How are you? I'm getting used to the service. I'm feeling a little better. Good. I wanted to thank you for what you tried to do today. Yeah, well, once a champion, always a champion. Look. Not many people would have gone as far as you did. You know, you almost got yourself killed. For a couple of... What? A couple of what? Do you have any idea why Peggy and I are going to Vegas? Sure. To hit it big on the craps table. Oh, come on! The tour is a cover-up for a couple of weekend warriors. You do know what that means, don't you? It means a hooker. I don't believe that. Well, believe it. So, you see, the most you could have done was save one more working girl in a town that's already got more than they need. Feel better, huh? Have you been doing this for very long? Well, Peggy's made a few trips. I'm a first-timer. Why? You run out of options. You know, the last time my ex sent a child-support payment was eight months ago. The job I have in the drug store pays the rent. But there's a gas tank and three mouths to fill. You know, and the extras, they keep eating you alive. Look, Irene. I believe you have a lot of problems but I don't believe you're out of options. Oh, yeah? Name one. Kurt! Kurt, Mr. Finch would like to come outside. He's cold. He feels cold and he'd like to come outside by the fire. Yeah, okay. Sure. Here it is. I need to talk... I need to talk to you, Edwards. Me? That's right. Hey, when you were out on your feet you did so much. I'll have Edwards call you when I'm ready, okay? The fire feels good. Thanks. Can I do anything? They're going to be coming back. What? Those three guys. Listen. You're the only one I've talked to on this trip. Yeah, we got along terrifically right from the beginning. Yeah, well, I was uptight and worried, but you're going to be going back. And you're a guy that lives by the rules. You noticed that. Yeah. There's a stamp in the lining in my coat in a glassine envelope. Oh? It's worth $90,000. I took it on consignment in Fort Worth the day before yesterday. There's a hotel owner in Vegas interested in buying valuable stamps. Those three... They took my wallet and it had a carbon of the receipt I gave for the stamp. Listen to me. If anything happens to me that stamp has got to get back to the people that gave it to me on consignment. I don't understand. If it was only your signature... That's what I mean. It's the only thing I ever really had that was worth something all by itself. My signature. Acknowledge receipt of silver-blue half-penny stamp issued by the Governor of all Malta in 1742. Same to be sold for a sum not less than... $90,000! To the above-designated and accepted business practice, John Finch. Wait a second. You mean this guy Finch has got a stamp on him worth 90,000 bucks? Sure! He must have thought we were after it when he pulled the 45 on the bus! It's sure not what we were going to get for Brain's wife but it would kind of soften the blow. Yeah. Let's get it. Come on. No. The desert could be crawling with police right now. Only one way to find out, Neil. No. There's a 5:00 a.m. advisory broadcast put out by the New Mexico Highway Patrol, mostly for truckers. They list accidents, and bridges and roads that are out. Look. If they found the bus, or if they know it's missing, they'll carry that, too. So, what do we do? We wait for the broadcast. If we find out things are okay we can see where we're going. Then we go for that stamp. Sounds good to me. Now we got a little time on our hands. I think I'm going to pass it as pleasantly as possible. Excuse me. No. No what, buddy? Not this time. Why is it always you first in line? I guess it's the natural order of things. Excuse me. Now hold it, the both of you. Listen to me. She's as good as dead already. How do you mean? I mean we let her go now. By noon tomorrow she's dying of exposure. That's enough. You're just deciding for all three of us, huh, Neil? All three of us need each other just to get out of this alive ourselves. That's yours, Neil. You can go, now. Just go on! If she makes it, she makes it. You did very well, today. Organized all the men on the bus and got the women looking for firewood. Well, it's like they say. Old soldiers never die. They just go to work for Golden West Tours. There's something about a uniform, huh? I guess. Speaking of which, for a girl who was just passing through you got pretty involved with us today. You got pretty involved with a man with a hole in his middle. Yeah, well there's something about guns that angers me, no matter who has them. Anyway, by this time tomorrow, I'm going to have the story of my life, and you'll be in Vegas with one of your girls. I guess we both got a little behind schedule. There must be somebody waiting for you back in Albuquerque. There was. Nice guy. Waited all through college. We almost did it. Started running second to that career? Oh, well. What's that old saying? Lovers are like streetcars. You miss one, there's another one every 15 minutes. But then you probably wrote it. Not really. You know, there could be a lot of girls and them sometimes there can be one woman. You ever hear of a place called Cholon? Yeah, it's a Chinese section of Saigon. It's Ho Chi Minh City, now, huh? Yeah, well, she's still there. I tried to get her out for four years. I couldn't do it, but I will. So help me God, I will. I would never have guessed. You weren't supposed to. I have to get you some help out here. How's Finch? He's dead. Why didn't you say something? He just died about 20 minutes ago. I didn't see any point in waking everyone up to tell them that. Poor guy. I wish to hell somebody would have found us. I wish there would have been someone here who could have made a difference. A doctor, or a nurse. I didn't even know his first name. I don't know why he didn't want the name tag. I don't even know why he had the gun. Just that Mr. Finch is dead. Harry. Wake up. We've got to start getting the people up. Finch is dead. We'll dig a shallow grave for him now. The body can be recovered once we get in, okay? I'll go get them. I'll get them started working. Light to heavy winds on Interstate 15 between Pittman and Las Vegas. A possibility of rain before noon in the Gallup area. Highway conditions are continuing satisfactory throughout the state. That concludes the highway advisory bulletin for today. Okay. We got word from the New Mexico Highway Patrol themselves. They ain't even looking yet. Here you go, Jim. Ouch! I'm sorry. Sorry won't cut it, buddy. You could see I was losing my grip. No. I did not know anything was wrong until you let go. Like hell, I let go! All right, give me another man. Maybe you'd like to do it alone, huh? We wouldn't be in this... one man dead, the rest of us going to boil if it wasn't for you. Hey, come on. Back off, buddy, huh? It's true! We'd all be in air-conditioned rooms in Las Vegas if it wasn't for him and his blonde girlfriend! Who the hell do you think you are? Come on, put it down! He's a little two-bit gambler, that's what he is! Let him go! Stop it, both of you. Now, come on! We've got enough to contend with in the next few hours. We start going after each other and everybody loses. All right. All right. Okay. I had no right to make a remark about your girlfriend. I hope she's all right. I know you people are in a lot of trouble because of me. I keep thinking about what's happening to Joyce, what could be happening to her and I don't know what to do. All right. Let's get back on the wheel. Both of you. He didn't make it. I don't know if you want the others to know that, but I know he didn't make it. Come on, you can't possibly... I was in Boston with him. If he'd made it, he'd be back by now with help. Look out, Harry. Got it? Yeah, okay. I got it. Well, one more to go and we got wheels on the buggy. You sure this thing will run on four tires? As far as the highway. All right, come on, everybody. Let's look alive. Look alive. Let's look alive to stay alive. Now lift this up. Lift it up. Get the lugs on here. All right! It seems like I've been running forever going nowhere. Hey, well it's easy to lose your direction out here at night. Instead of running towards the highway, you were running out into the desert. Hey, Neil! Wasn't that one of the guys from the bus? Yeah. Let's get him! Stop! Those guys robbed the bus! What do you want to do, Neil? Let's forget it. Come on, we got work to do! How's it going, Lee? Making any progress? Don't worry, Harry. You'll get out of here soon. Lee! You all right, Lee? Hey thanks, Harry. -The bus isn't. -No. Boy, it looks like it's too low to jack up now. Well, we'll just have to lift it. But that bus must weight four or five tons! I want everybody on the front end of the bus. Oh, come on! You'd better listen to him! It won't work, Harry. Well it better, because... They're coming back. Who's coming back? Those three punks. The ones that killed Mr. Finch. Why? Why are they coming back? Because by now they they've probably found a receipt in his wallet. A receipt for a stamp worth $90,000 that he was going to sell in Las Vegas. Where's this stamp, Harry? It's right here. Well, suppose we gave it to them? No. Don't do it. Don't give them anything. No. We will not let those hoodlums take advantage of us a second time! I say we don't give them the stamp, or the bus or us! I say the hell with them! Okay, let's do it. Everybody on the front end of the bus! Right! Come on! All we have to do is tilt it. All you fellas take a position. Ladies, give them some room. You put the jack under it. Okay. We're going to lift when I say three. All right. Okay. Put your backs into it now! One, two, three! Harry. Get everybody back on the bus. On the bus, everybody, quickly! Quickly! Come on! Get on the bus! Get on! Come on, come on! Hurry up! Move to the back of the bus! -Hurry up! -Come on, hurry up! Harry! Get on the bus! No. I have what they want. Hey! Harry! Everybody down. Now! Get on the floor! Oh, hell! It's all my fault in the first place. I never should have tried to drag you out to Vegas. You didn't want to go in the first place. Irene! You're okay. You're not hurt. -Is she all right? -It's the girl! She got away! Be careful! She's okay. Somebody get her some water! You just take it easy, Harry. We're going to get you some help real fast. All I could think about last night and most of today was getting away with that stamp and putting the money in my own pocket. Hey, we don't have to know what was going through your head. We all have some crazy thoughts. You're a good company man, Harry. The best. It's a helicopter! Look! Hey, hey. It's all over. You're all right now. It's okay. Come, on Joyce, stop. Listen. I got to talk to you. Now, look. When we get back the pressures are really going to start. We're going to have all kinds of questions to answer. So, we got to get our stories straight, huh? Don't you care at all what did happen? Of course I care. Of course. But you don't understand I could lose everything. I'm not a young man. I have nothing, no place to go without... You got to appreciate my situation. Sure, Martin. I understand. Like you said, we've got to get our stories straight. They've got Russ with them. He's all right! That was the best action sequence I've ever seen in my life and I didn't have my camera with me. Well, you can always work the El Paso shopping tour next week. Lee? Lee? There are going to be a lot of people waiting. Photographers, reporters. Why don't you put your cap on? I think it looks pretty good! All right! Well, next stop, Las Vegas. Take any seat. Any open seat, please. He's okay! I knew he'd make it! I just want to go back to Albuquerque. We're on our way to Vegas!
