The Orchid Dancer was restored by the Cineteca of Bologna and Gaumont Path? from an original unedited nitrate negative. The restitution of the original edit has been made from directions on the leaders and notes on the film's edges. The original intertitles have been lengthened from the positive tinted flash titles on the original negative. The choice of tinting was dictated by descriptions on the leaders and the intertitle colours. The restoration was carried out by the L'Immagine Ritrovata laboratory in 2011.
