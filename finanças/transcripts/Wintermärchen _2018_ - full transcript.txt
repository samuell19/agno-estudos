Two times. Yes. Try it crouching down. And one handed. Yes, one handed. Come on. - Yes! Yes, not bad. Shit. Shit. That impossible. That can't be. - Calm down. We will find it. Found it. Do you have it? Let's count again. Yes. Okay? Take this one. Deeper. Further in! Are you crazy! What about him? - No. That guy? - Him? Yeah. No. What? - He saw my face! Oh, God! It's not like... - He saw me. ... he's going to remember. Or that guy? Doesn't matter who I suggest, you're just scared. What about him? Or him? Too many people, I can't just... What do you want, asshole? Him? This one. What about him? - I am not shooting around here. What about him? He is German. Drive on! What is German about him! Good morning. What are you watching? Come on! Come on now. Ow. Stop! Harder. What? - Harder. Harder. Wait. - Come on. If even that is not working anymore. I am hungry. - Then eat something. There is nothing there. There is always something. How much? - 16.02 euros. For you. You spent money on that? Didn't cost anything. I stole it. Are you crazy? We can't have you getting arrested for something like this. Nothing wrong with a bit of fun. This whole thing is no fun for me. Shit! Be more careful! What's the problem? I try. Damn it. There were those two at the supermarket. - What? What about them? They were there kissing in the aisle. Don't start with that crap again. You think it's because he gives her cheap chocolates? I don't think they need that. They're enough for each other. They're content. Not like us. We're... Hey! Something has to happen. Something has to change, Tommi. I don't care what. Something, good or bad, I don't fucking care. Something that makes a big bang, something... Come here. Hey. What? You not well? Why? And now what? You have a problem with that? - No. I mean... When I see you like this I think you're not feeling well. Or what should I think? - My God, than you re thinking to much. Hey, come on. What is it? Go away! Just go, will you! What do you want? - Put the cup down. Oh, I hate all of this... My hand! I just want to know what's up. Hey... Ow! - Shit! Are you all right? Get away from me! Everything OK? - Go away! Go away! Get lost! Go away! Everything OK? Don't you have school? No. Hi. 2.70 euros, please. I think I'll go instead. Hey, I'm not that bad. Here. You wanna go back into the park? Yes. - OK. But... I had to learn that too. I wanted to study, but than I got scared. But if you learn that, then you will be on the right path. I think you are one that one can go through thick and thin with. I really like you. Come on, have another sip. Hey! Now... You crazy? Don't you get it? Don't you get it? I'm not one of the bad guys! I'm not one of the bad guys! OK, catch me. You have to catch me! Quick, other way! Oh my God, oh my God! Very nice. Hi. Hi. - Hello. Didn't you have a hoody? No. Where is it then? Isn't it hanging here? No. Are you kidding? You lose your hoody in broad daylight? Are you an idiot? - No idea. Something happen? No. Hey, I asked you if something happened. - No, nothing happened. Don't fuck with me. I see that something happened. Tell me. If you fuck up, you know you'll drag me into it too. Yes. - Hey! Look at me! Are you fucking with me? You fuck up, then lie to me? What do you want to hear from me? - Keep it down! So I lost my hoody. Happy now? No, I'll be happy when you admit you're a complete idiot! How can you lose your hoody? Are you a moron, or what? I can't..., I can't... I can't do this anymore. - Can't do what? Can't do what anymore? Look at me. This is just nuts! I do weird stuff all the time. You've got to be kidding. - I don't trust myself anymore. I don't believe this. You don't get to just decide that. We're in this together. You have to understand! - You don't decide! This is crazy! - You don't decide alone, got it? We're in this together! This is about both of us, you can't make that decision alone! You're not allowed to make that decision alone! Hey, how is everybody? Yes, they were so nice. As always. You two. - Do you smoke in here? Well, it's damn cold out on the balcony. I don't want that. They're my kids, OK? I don't want them exposed to that. - Could you go to Tommi? Hey. Are you making rules for me, or what is this? I just think it's antisocial. - What? You've got to be kidding me. If I didn't see to them they'd be with youth services. You cunt! I don't need your help. That was the last time you see my kids! Now you listen, here, honey... I'll smoke when I want to smoke. OK? I don't give a fuck what you think. They like it here with me, always. Now apologize. Sorry. Ow! - Please? Sorry! Kids! We're going. Asocial scum! You bitch! We're not just giving up, OK? Yes. Tell me what really turns you on. You. You turn me on. Just tell me. Your ass. Your tits. - No, man. When I take you from behind... ... and you dig your claws into me. Tell me, like a... ... like a fantasy you have. Sometimes I think of niggers. What? Yes! Don't laugh. Don't laugh. Tell me. Anything? Yes. Sometimes... ... I think about just sitting next to you, watching. When we fuck? - Yes. When some other guy... When some other guy... ... does you. He pushes your head to the ground and you try to scream. You want to scream, but your mouth is taped shut. And you resist, and the guy... he smacks you in the face, and just keeps fucking you! Got a lighter? - Yeah. Put it down over there. OK. Oh. OK. I know the reason. It'll work next time. This isn't going to work. I'm done. I'm not doing this again. Would you stop? I'm always the idiot. You spend hours on it, and in the end it doesn't work. It's pointless. The last one did! - Right! It just went off too early. It wasn't my fault, I told you. - No, of course not! It's never your fault. It always comes down to luck. This time we had no luck. - Always blame the others. No, I'm to blame, right? I'm good for nothing. - Oh, God! Cut that crap! You and your self-pity. - I'm done! I'm sick of this bull. Fuck off! - You fuck off! Sweetie? - What? You're hungry? Come on now. What are you doing? Are you crazy? What the hell? Hey! What are you doing? Have you lost it? Hey, come on! That's not allowed, knock it off. - Not allowed? No, not allowed. Ah, between the two of you nothing is allowed. We have a few rules here, and we follow those rules. Rules, rules! Am I in the army, or what? Let Micky settle in first. There's a reason for why we live here and how things work. But you don't get it. We're in the underground here. Oh, cut the underground nonsense. Nobody cares what you do here. Oh, really? - Yeah. We have to be better organized. - What are you two on about? I didn't come here to discuss the "underground," like the Antifa or something. Micky, it's a new situation for you... - Micky, Micky, Micky! Knock off the Micky bullshit! That's exactly what I meant. I knew he'd pull this and act the big shot. I want to do something, not just talk about it. Now listen... - No, now you listen! I don't want to hear it. I'm at least as good as you guys. If not better. Twice as good. OK. Sure thing. You really have a big mouth, don't you? Really big balls. - I sure do. I've got really big balls. Hey! God, please! What? Don't you like it? Don't you like it, sweetie? Want to play with it? Get lost! Hey! Go away! Ew! Stop! Go away! Cool, Micky! Ta-da! Something... Is this canned soup? Try it. With cuts of meat. What a stellar chef you are. You get it in Grande Vignolle in Brussels. Can you taste the Cayenne pepper? Do you taste it? Yes? Really tastes good. - Do you? And the Dijon noodles. Got those? Have you tried them? Here. Dijon. Nice, huh? Isn't it pronounced Dijin? - No, Di-Jon. My grandmother from Mons made it like this. Do you taste it? Do you? I'm taking a shower. You coming? Now? - Sure. You could make yourself useful and do the dishes. You're the woman of the house. Depends how you look at it. Hot! You Swine. You little pig. Hey, faggot. Should I fuck you too? You'd like it, wouldn't you? For me to fuck you good. What's going on in here? Well, nothing. Ey, what s going on here? Tommi needs to fuck something too. To get him on track. Then he should look for something. Ready to go again? Sure. Come on. I always am. Really? Turns you on a bit, doesn't it? Where? - Up ahead. Over there? - Yeah. And the cars? - Cars? Why are there cars? - Calm down. It's fine. There are cars all over. You out of your mind! Stop it. - It's still open. Why is there a light on? No, it's not. Hurry up! - Faster! Give me that. What? - Give me that. That wasn't the plan. - So? You think I'll sit here without one? Will you shut up! - Give it to me now! Know where the release is? - Yes! Come on, let's go! What's going on? What do you want from me? What's up? Get up! Get a grip! Come on! Move out! Up now! - Micky? Dad! Dad! Come on over, come on! Come on! Lay down! Please, I have family and children! - Down on the ground! Pull the trigger! Kill him! On the ground, idiot! - Shoot! Shut up! Fuck! - Shut up! Always! Always... Always praying, you fucking Muslims! Come on! You'll get busted! Shit! Move it! Wipe it up! Go on! Come on! Let's go! Get up! Go! - Go! Get in! Step on it! That was cool! So cool! So cool! Yeah! Yeah! What does it sound like when Turks play ping-pong? Ata-türk, Ata-türk, Ata-türk. - Did you see his fear? Such cowards, no honor. Three schnapps. - Yes. And three beers, please. Good evening. - Hey. Did you order? - Three and three. We got a good result today. That was fast. How do we come together? Radiantly. How do we part? Completely plastered. And why? Because we're so sexy! Now wash it down. Cheers. - Celebrating something? Yeah. - Cheers. You can say that again. - Cheers. Is it your birthday? - Look me in the eye! Or you'll have seven years of... - You ought to know. You're not from around here, are you? No, we're... We're on vacation. - Vacation? Vacation here in our area? Sure thing. - I think it's great here. So what goes on around here? What goes on? I mean, it's quiet around here, right? You don't have many problems, do you? No problems. He said we have no problems. Great. We've got plenty of problems. No shortage of them. You can say that again. - Or not? Problems with whom? Forgot about it. What? Foreigners? With the foreigners... They bought an Angolan for eight million. Who can't play. - Dark as they come. An Angolan. Can't play worth shit. Dark as they come? Yes, dark as they come. Can't play, but he thinks he owns... ... the island! Island monkey! Not just that. He thinks he owns all of Germany. To Germany! - To Germany! Germany! - Germany! Why the stupid look? - Just today they gunned one down. An Angolan? - No, Turks. Turks. Three of them. - A father and two sons. In the supermarket. Or do you have a bottle? - Aisha, it's all wet here! Yeah, someone did it... - Thanks, so nice of you. ... at the supermarket. - What's a Turk with a wooden leg? Turkish lumber. Turkish lumber! Let them bash each other's heads in. Yeah, but where they come from, not here. I agree. - Cheers. So they kill each other? Like a clan feud, or what? - Sure. Of course. - They're too dumb to kill each other. Could've been Germans too. No idea, it'll be online tomorrow. - Exactly. To Germany! Heil! You have to speak slowly for him. Dance on. - Dance! Hey, you two. - Yeah. Where do you work? At Amazon. Amazon. Oh yeah? - Yeah. Cool. - Yeah, it really is cool. Super cool. I just finished five weeks of late shift. Now it's time to party, right? Party. You have to work tomorrow? Uh... no. No. I'm off too. And what do you do? - I go to university. Yeah, I did that once too. Yeah, then I got sick and tired of constantly staring at a screen. Then it's all for the best, huh? Well, I'm still just staring at a screen. What did you say? So the computer is your boss, huh? What nonsense! No, of course not! My boss is a person, of course! He comes around every now and then and then he stares at the computer too. Oh, God! You're actually totally right, the boss of my boss... I mean... The computer is the boss of my boss. Really. "You are working too slow. Please hurry or you will get a spanking." Are we going to fuck tonight? What? Nothing. What? It was a joke. I wanted to see your reaction. No, I... - And them? What about that guy, them? They'll get some action tonight. She's still mine. I heard your gun's jammed. Hey... - What? What did you say? Jamming gun - then you've got to let others fire. No, really? Hey, stop. Really. - That has nothing to do with me and Becky. Yes, it does. - No, no. Come on. It's all good. It's all right. Come on. It's all in good fun. It's all right, come on. Stop it. You're dancing with me. - Hey! You'll dance with me! - I decide for myself! You're nuts! - You can dance with her in a bit. You can't screw around in front of me. I said you can dance with her in a bit, OK? - Stop! Stop! What are you doing? Is there trouble? - No, no. Aisha! - I want you out of here now! He drank too much. - Now! Finish your beer and get out of here right away. I don't want trouble. - Aisha, you're causing trouble. No, I want you gone now. Everything OK? Come on. - No, no... Come. - No, no... You also want it. - What? Come on. - No,No,No... Come here. Sh! No, no. Hey! Is the door closed? Is the door closed? Close the door. "After financial irregularities were revealed in a Turkish aid society, the victim was murdered." Why don't they write about us? "There was a clash among refugees." Fuck. What s up with you? Hello. Hi. I was thinking about you the whole time. I was worried about you. Don't fall over. - What's up? Don't let me fall! What are you doing? You guys doing well? - Yeah. Play something nice. Go on. Go on. Do the tower. - No! Show me the Eiffel Tower. Hey. Hey! Leave him his guitar at least. Dude, come on! Stop! - Tommi! Hey! - Don't touch my damn guitar! I was playing, man! Give me the guitar! I'll punch you! Where is that prick? Unbelievable. What are you ordering? It's all too expensive, forget it. There they are. Hi. - There you are. This is Susann. - Hi. Maik. Is that stain from jerking off? Nonsense. Ouzo. Here you are. I don't quite believe this. May I take your order? - Whatever what you want. It's on me. I will take... - I think we need a bit more time. To you guys. Hey! Cheers to us? Are you kidding me? Tommi, are you out of your mind? I know it's strange... What's strange? What's strange? - Stop it! What's strange? - Stop it! What's strange? - Are you kidding me? What's strange? - I thought it was about time we all met. Yeah! Great idea! We don't even know her. You fucked in the head? You fucked in the head? - Becky, it's all OK. Please. He told me a lot about you. I know. Does she know? What does she know, damn it? - Susanne wants to join us. I was thinking... - Join us? Tommi said... - You want to join us? What a great idea! Real nice of him. He said it's nothing for me, but I'm serious. I really will make a contribution. Who else knows you're in town? No one. But we have rules that must be followed. - I know. Of course, I'm the new girl. - The new girl? How cute you are. Such a cute little thing. Let's drink to that, then. To the new girl. OK, unfortunately, we can't afford to feed another person. I'll really do anything you want. Anything you say. - Anything? Really? So? Have you decided yet? - Yes, uh... I think we'll leave. Sorry. Now what? And? Any idea where we should go now? Sorry, that was dumb! All of it. - That wasn't dumb, you planned it that way! Her joining would've been best for us all. You knew that's impossible. You knew from the start I'd say no. There are three of us. You can't just join, and screw it all up! Hey! Then I'll set us all on fire! That's what you want! - You nuts? Isn't that what you want? You want us all to die here! That's what you want! I can hardly breathe with all these fucking fumes! Get a grip on yourself, you idiot! Act like a man for once! Get it! Like a man! Then you'll feel better. Stop that shit. Out! Get out, the both of you. Piss off! Out! Out! Get lost! Give me the key. The damned key! - What? No! You crazy? - The key! Give me the key. - What are you doing, man? You nuts? - The place is about to burn! What are you doing? Stop! What are you doing? Hurry up. Where? Fuck where? - Take this right! Scream at me again and I'll smack you! - Hurry, they're about to close. Take it. Do everything. Be careful! They're not closing, it's way too early. Go slower here! - That it? Scream at me again and I'll smack you! Ten refugees to every lawyer. - Quiet! Here. Slower! - Ten! You wait for us, got it? Keep the engine running. And don't leave me hanging again, got it! - Yes. Right... - There won't be ten lawyers! You got the gun? - I have it. One, two, three... It's showtime! Ready? - Here we go! Where's your boss? Boss not here. - Where's your boss? Where are the lawyers? Where are the fucking lawyers? - Not here. Gone home. What? - Not here! I don't believe it! - Damn it! That was so stupid! - Take our money. Take our money! - What? Then shoot her! No! Shit! Hey, Tommi! Tommi! That was still cool. It was great. Wasn't it cool? Tell me you liked it! That was cool! Was that cool? It was cool! Yes. It was. Are you crazy? - Come on. "Don't understand..." Oh man! He had to go if he doesn't understand. Here. "Boss not here." "Gone home." What were they thinking? That we'd just leave again? These cowards... no honor. "Please, please! Please take money." "Please!" - Yes, thank you, that's enough now! Couldn't have been that cool. It was pretty cool. - Pretty cool, right? They'll just be replaced tomorrow. It's pointless. - Calm down! Here, have a schnapps. Come on. - But what's the point? Besides you having your fun? Playing romper room and I'm the fucking driver? - You go next time. Huh? I bet it won't all be fun and games. - Stop. Stop it! Oh, Becky, drive faster! Oh, come on. Dude! What are you doing? Perfect! That's... - You're not really? Holy shit. You're serious? No way! - You're not... No way. Yeah! Come in! Man, how stupid. What a complete retard. - What's he doing? No joke, he's crazy. We really found ourselves a complete idiot. I'm sick of it. - Come in! No, I'm cold. Lovely! - I'm cold. Are you OK? Germany! Come in! Let's swim. Get in! Tommi? Becky? Prudes. What the hell? What's going on? Everything OK? No idea. We got back and Becky got chatty with them. Just put it in the back. - Why did you go? I thought it was the cops. Bang-bang! On your knees! Headshot! Headshot! Headshot! Headshot! Headshot! Knock it off! - No. Hi. - Hi. Got a light? Here. - Thanks. Is it okay if I sit down for a moment? You can tell me. I understand. It is odd. Some old dude sitting next to you and chatting you up. No need to be afraid of me. I'm harmless. I'm not. I'm actually a good guy. You know... Deep down, I'm really a good guy. I'm going somewhere else afterwards. You can come along if you want. Yeah? Yeah, maybe. - Maybe what? You coming or not? I don't think so. That's what I always say! We're all the same shit! Shit! Are we not? - But you have that everywhere. It doesn't fucking matter. You have it... You have it in soccer. You have it in politics, in religion. Everywhere. - Yeah right, soccer! Soccer too. - It's never your fault. Never! It never was my fault! Then love is to blame. - What bullshit! Right? - Yeah, love. Love. - Love. It's time to clean up! Where? In soccer? - In this country. In this country? - In all countries! And then? - But... that's a bit difficult. If it doesn't come from politicians people will take it into their own hands. I think so too. You guys know what? It wasn't too long ago, and not very far from here, some foreigners got offed. They said at the time that it was "criminal clans" or something. So I say to Rosie, "Rosie," I say, "I hope it wasn't Nazis who did it." That's what I said, right? Didn't I? Just imagine. Nazis. Lovely. - Yeah, lovely. I think we have to go home. - Why? It's just getting good! Yeah... I think we should call it a night, too. - You think? You usually blab about politics. I don't know what you mean. I need my jacket. Are you embarrassed in front of these people? Just when I'm feeling good for five minutes! OK? Can you just stop for once? Who always says, "Dago! Polack! Off to the gas chambers!" Shut up! Shut up! Shut your fucking mouth! Shut your mouth! What's wrong? - You shut your mouth too! Get away! What happened? What? What are you all staring at? Sorry. - Grab your stuff. Go. Tommi, can you stop annoying us with that shit for two seconds? This is it. Holy shit. No lights after dark, no cell phones. Everything else good with you? Need anything? We need a silencer. - You don't need silencers in here. Is anyone even noticing anything? We'll see. No new operations for now. Lay low for a while. Shit! Fuck! Stupid asshole. Stupid fucking asshole! That sucks! Hey. Man, I don't feel like it, not up for it. OK? Hey. Man, I don't feel like it, OK? This is all fucked up. So fucked up. Nobody is even interested in what we're doing. And now we're stuck here. - Who cares what anyone out there thinks. We keep going. - Because we're so cool, right? But if no one notices what we're doing, it's not worth shit! I am going crazy in here! Man! Just screw off, will you! We keep going. What? You don't even say hello? We need a silencer. Forget it. You're lucky I even came out here. We bust our ass and then get told off? You fucked it up. - You fucked it up! All your operations are totally pointless. And why? Because of you! Nobody even notices what we're doing, except state security and some comrades. Otherwise, nobody cares. From now on keep quiet. Got it? - We won't be told what to do anymore. We do what we please. Oh yeah? I snap my finger and they have you. One call. Then we'll take you out too. - I want to read something about us. You can't set conditions here. But that's what we're doing. Tommi. Hands up! Get over to the cash register! Open the register! Do it! Open the register! Do it! Give us the money! Come on! Come on! - Open the register! Damn it! - The money! Open it! Open it! - Do it! Do it! Now! - Come on! Open it! - Do it, now! Do something! Do something! You're not quite right! You stupid fuck! Are you out of your mind? Oh Fuck! Stop! Stop! Come on, man! Come on, now! Shit! Shit! Are we going to leave them here now, or what? Stop it, now! Tommi, stop! OK. OK. Come on. - Come on, man. I'm going to be sick. - Come on now. Hey, no! Stop it. He was blond, didn't you see that? - So what? He looked Eastern European. - He was a German! Are you completely insane? You've got to be kidding me! We need the fucking money, that's it! I'll never get rid of that. I'll never get rid of it! I'll never get rid of it! Shut your face! Shut your mouth! You two are such complete idiots! I knew it would end this way. I knew it! He can't take it. Not at all! He totally loses it! Why is he even here? You belong in an asylum! - Me? Know what? Your whining is really getting on my... - Now just wait! What do you want? What the hell do you guys want? What? Fuck you! Piss off! Do your shit without me! Do your shit without me! - No problem. Leave me alone! - No problem. Just leave me alone. We're leaving. We don't need you. All you do is slow us down anyway! Micky? - No. No what? What do you mean no? - You think you have a say here? You don't! Oh? Without me, you're a total failure. Without me, you can't do shit. Nothing! What'll you do without me? - She always said that to me too. You fucking witch! Get lost! You're why we screw it all up. You're slowing us down! With your depressive bullshit and your jabbering! You know what? You two faggots can fuck each other in the ass! Fuck each other in the ass in this shitty shed, you homos! What did you say? I said you two are fucking homos. Knock off that crap. Shut your fucking mouth! Shut your mouth! You're good at that, huh? You're so good at that! All you can do is beat people up! Nothing else, huh? Nothing? - No, nothing! Stop with this crap! - That's how you guys wanted it, huh? We'll throw out the old witch and open our gay wonderland! Go on, get started. Go on, fuck each other in the ass. Fuck each other in the ass! Go on, get started. You two are so ridiculous! You are so ridiculous! Stop. Stop. Stop! Stop it! Stop, stop! Shut your mouth. - Stop. Stop! Tommi! Oh, God. Oh, God. Shit! Is it OK? Yeah. Catch it! Catch it! How much? Not much. Hey. Tell me. Do you love me? Cut the crap. Say it! - Cut the crap. Come on, say it! Drop it! Say it. Uh... Say it. - Yes... Yes what? Yes what? - Yes! Yes what? Say that you love me, man! - Yes, I... Yes? Yes... Say that you love me! Yes... Say it! - I... I love you. You love me? - Yes, yes. I love you, man. They don't notice a damn thing. - Fucking mafia. See how he looked at me? The son of a bitch. Did you? Did you see how he looked at me? OK, slow down. They're making out. Did you see? - Yeah? They made out! - Let's get them! Come on, man! Yeah. Yeah! Yeah! - Fuck, yeah! Drive, drive! OK. Hello. Fuck! It's the cops! It's not the cops. - Still! You scared? Are you trying to get us killed? Come on. Come on. What's wrong with you? Hey. Hey, what are you doing with the gun? Hey! Hey, Micky! Sit down. Man, just sit down. Put the gun away, man. Put the gun away. Please. Come on. Knock it off! I'm ready now, Micky. You and me, we'll clean up. I've been holding back so far, but now... - Just look at you. Look at me. We look like shit. But it'll get better. It'll get better, I swear. I swear. Becky has to come back. You have to swing it somehow. Straight ahead. Can I help you? We're looking for Becky. Is she here? Hello, first of all. - Hello. You don't remember me, do you? - Yes, I do. I remember you very well. What do you want from my daughter? Becky? - Leave. It's OK, Mom. It's OK. We have cake. Have a seat then. I'll make coffee. Coming here was the dumbest thing you could do. We need you. You realize that now? - It'll all be different now. We'll pull out all the stops. Sure. No compromises. Now I get it. You really believe that, huh? We won't hide like they want us to. That's over now. There's no reason to. We can be proud of ourselves. It feels wrong without you. Please. I can't do it anymore. Stop it. - Is there a problem? What happened? They came to take me with them, Mom. We're going to take Becky with us. - I don't think so. Not if she doesn't want to. She didn't say she doesn't want to. You stay here, Becca. Don't listen to them. I don't know what kind of relationship you have... I'm grown up. I can speak for myself. - In this case, you can't. I can tell something's wrong here. Something's off. I'm entitled to protect my daughter, right? - Oh, yeah? That would be a first. Is that how you talk to me? I'd like you to leave now. We'll leave when we want to. And we're taking Becky. I should not have let the likes of you in my house. I can't believe the people you associate with! Pack your things, we're leaving. - I won't let anyone order me around! No, no, no. You're staying here, you got that? You're good for nothing! Look at these misfits you hang around with. I'm such a misfit too, aren't I? Now get a grip, missy! That's enough! I'm calling the police. No, no, no! No, Mom. Stop it! Stop! Don't! Mom! What are you doing? We've killed people! Who've you killed, Rebecca? - Foreigners, Mom, we killed foreigners! You killed people? Really? Where did that happen? I haven't heard a thing. You're not even capable of such a thing. Ow! You stupid bitch. - Ow. We killed them! Shit, let's go, Becky. You are an evil child! Hey! When the police come you don't know anything, OK? It's not true what Becky said. We're nice people. Respectable people. Yeah! Fuck, yeah! Now it's time to clean house! Point the gun at me. Yes. Undress, strip off. Is the gun loaded? Sexy! Come on! Let's go! Go ahead and kiss. Come. Wait, I need something to drink. Come on. What's wrong? - Sorry. What? Did you come? What the fuck? Seriously? What were the two nappy headed niggers doing in bed? Taking a nap! That tickles! Who is this? Who is it? You? The cold ones are Micky's. We're the greatest! We're the greatest. Here comes the storm. Stop, I'm going in the middle. I'm in the middle. - What? Come on, come on. That's mean. - Uh-uh. The middle is best. It's so cool. They can't keep us down now. They can't ignore us anymore. There's no good picture of me. For the newspaper, you mean? Not a single photo! My uncle has one. Maybe I'll just call him. Yeah. - They can use that. For the papers. Waszec... If Waszec reads that... I'm just imagining how they'll tell stories about us. Like a legend or something. About our love too. Just like hippies. But it's beautiful, isn't it? What are you doing? What are you doing? - What? I don't want to die! Let us alone. I'm going out there! I'm surrendering! - No! No, stay here. - If I put my hands up they won't shoot. Then they won't shoot! - You won't go out. No, they won't shoot! - Stop it! I hate you. - I love you. Fuck you! I hate you! - I'm sorry. Tommi, Tommi... I'm scared! Police! - Get on the ground! Hands on your back! Turn over! On the ground, hands behind your back! Micky! Micky! Where is the weapon? Get up, you swine! Get up, bastard! These dogs! The police... You assholes! I don't want to! I don't want to! Open the door. - Open it up! Get in there, God damn it! Becky! Hey, Becky! Becky! Come on. You are really dumb that's why you're feeling fine. Hate is your attitude your blood boils constantly. Everything needs to be explained to you because you really don't know anything most likely not even what attitude means! Your violence is only a silent cry for love your combat boots long for tenderness you have never learned to articulate yourself and your parents never had time for you.. ohhh... ... asshole! Why do you have fear of caressing what's the meaning of all this nonsense? Under the laurel wreath with acorns I know your heart beats and romanticism is only grey theory for you between Störkraft and the Onkelz is a Kuschelrock LP! Your violence is only a silent cry for love your combat boots long for tenderness you have never learned to articulate yourself and your parents never had time for you... ohhh...
