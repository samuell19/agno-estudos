Well, Robert's always been very authentic. He is a total rock star. Criminally underappreciated. He's Shakespearean. He's a very serious actor, but he's also a great comedian. Robert, as a fellow actor, is a dream. Robert Englund's a great actor. It's as plain as that. Fasten your seat belts. Okay, I'm ready. Okay. I never set out to become a horror icon. It's something I wasn't planning. It's just something that happened. I went right into the makeup tests and that's sort of where I found a lot of the character and the voice. Johnny Depp waltzed in about a week into the shooting and Heather looking all beautiful and young and dewy. And there was the makeup girl with little pink fans she bought them: "We have to keep our stars cool." What am I, chopped liver? And I'm sitting over there. I've been working since five in the morning. I'm itchy. I've got glue all over me, the makeup man, David Miller, stabbing me with this crusty makeup brush, and I'm kinda pissed at the kids. They don't need makeup. They're beautiful. They've got their whole careers ahead of them. God, I envy those little... And I went, "Wait a minute. That envy, that jealousy I have for those beautiful young actors," I said, "I can use that. What is Freddy? He's a child killer. What are children? Children are the future." So for the rest of the movies, I was able just to remember that moment, that little synapse of mine. I can get there, just like I got there now. And that's all I need to believe in Freddy, just to get back to that little moment. And that becomes my shorthand getting to an essence of Freddy that I need to get to without just going "Booga, booga, booga," you know. Robbie Englund was sort of preordained to be a lawyer. This is what my father wanted. He knew I had the gift of gab, and I broke my father's heart. I believe it was either my 11th or my 12th summer, I was sent off as a chaperone of my mother's best friend's gorgeous teenage daughter. She was a wannabe actress, and a year older than I was. So we went to this professional children's theater together and I figured I was going to be sweeping the stage and having a flashlight and ushering people in. And it's a big transition in life. You go from being... literally from being a child to the teenage world, but it was also this world of theater that I entered that summer, and I wound up starring in everything. I was Pinocchio, I was Peter Pan, I was Aladdin. And at some point that summer, I was in the girls' bathroom. And the girls were teaching me how to blow smoke rings. They were the harem girls. And I'm sitting there, and I had curly hair, to begin with, but they were like giving me a perm. I'm full of screaming hormones. Twelve years old, I had a breast in this ear, a boob in this ear, a belly button right here, as the girls touched me and played with me and curled me and rolled my hair. And I've got a cigarette and I sort of said to myself, "I like this. I think I'm gonna do this." I had this sequence where Pinocchio's in shorts, lederhosen, and I would run across the stage mugging "Oh, no." And the Indians would follow me and shoot arrows at me. And then I'd run back the other way. Well, during the run of the show, every time I came back for my second run across the stage, I would add an extra arrow or two, and the laugh got bigger. I had arrows in my ass now; even a bigger laugh. Well, I got to love that laugh. That was mine. I controlled it, I'd enhanced it, and I really loved it. I went off stage and there were guests backstage. And one of the guests backstage was none other than the great improvisational talk show host Steve Allen. Anyway, I know many of you want to know what kind of a show we'll be doing here on Sundays. I know I... I'd like to know. But this is like the late-night talk show in the world. The Tonight Show before Johnny Carson, and I idolized him. And he had... a friend's daughter was in the show, and he'd come back, going to give her a bunch of roses, and he'd saved a rose. I heard this voice, "Where's the kid that plays Pinocchio?" He goes, "Oh, there's the puppet." And he gave me the rose and he said, "You got it, kid." I'm literally a kid. I'm 13 years old. To get that kind of vote of confidence... You know, grownups were not afraid in those days to tell you you were special, or you had a gift, you know. They weren't worried about being sued by the Board of Education or your parents, because your parents wanted you to be an engineer or a lawyer or a doctor. A lawyer in my case, and I, you know, my parents kind of knew. I'd like to introduce you to one of your sons. - Oh. - This is Adam, Rob. Lester. - Lester. - Lester. Pleasure to meet ya. What's so touching about Robert is that maybe we're with a group of people and there might be someone who's new to the acting world. He'll immediately say to them, "Oh, I saw you when you were in that after-school special when you were 14 years old," and he makes you feel like you're one of the club. I think one of the things that you realize if you start to last a while in the business is that every year there's a fresh crop of people who are breaking into it who don't know as much as the veterans do, and Robert was always teaching. We figured out how to do it safely. - Yeah. Run, like Peter Cushing in Horror of Dracula. - Right. Okay. Run on the table and jump over the fire... - Right. ...and then land with a sword and, "Stand back. He's mine." - Yeah. Argh. Boom. This was my first time directing. I was fucking scared. I mean, this is Robert Englund. This is Lin Shaye. This is big time. Robert put his arm around me, and he gets real close, and he's like, "I know you're nervous. Don't be. You come to me for anything." He set the tone. All right, picture. Enough, guys. Quiet. Here we go, guys. I'd just wrapped, you know, everybody did the... the big clap, you know. And I was heading to my hotel, and I heard "Corey." And I turn and I look, and in one of the side rooms was Robert. He goes, "Come in here. I think you really have a lot of talent. And it'd be really cool for you to keep going and do that." He's like, "You did a really good job," and I just went... To me, it was like, such a great compliment from an amazingly accomplished actor. And it takes a really generous person to actually turn that spotlight onto all the people around him. I just think that's really rare in... in... in Hollywood. Robert knew from an early age that he was talented at this. It wasn't just a hobby. It was something he was, not only that he loved, but that he was good at. The reason you would discourage a child from being an actor is because it's a pretty sketchy, scary way to make money. My parents sent me off with... with... with good tidings to the teenage drama workshop. It was a shock to me later on to find out they didn't want me to pursue it. And I had been recruited by Stanford, and I didn't want to go there. They didn't have a particularly great theatre department or anything else. It really damaged the relationship, I think, with my father; not my mother so much, but my father, and... you know, that his son was going to, "Hey diddle-dee-dee. An actor's life for me." You know, I don't think he wanted that. I think he worried for me. I don't think they disapproved of acting per se. They just recognized that it was a really tough job. I did all the traditional academic training. I did Julius Caesar, and I did Playboy of the Western World. I was doing classics now as well as I did, not Dracula, but I played Jonathan Harker, the young man whose girlfriend is suffering the effects of the vampire. I looked like a kind of skinny, big Adam apple, Danny Kaye back then. Of course, I was, you know, ripped because I was a surfer and I had long blonde hair, but I was hardly a leading man. He was a very plain kid. I mean, he was, he's not the Robert we see now. I don't know what the hell I meant by that, but, you know, they were... they were kinder to plain-lookin' people. I was pretty plain. My audition in college, I followed Richard Dreyfuss, who had done an Edward Albee monologue. And that was like, just amazing. And I knew enough not to follow him. I took my name off the list because I knew I could never top his... it was just, he was brilliant. He in fact, dropped out a couple of weeks later, and he actually told me, you know, "You got to get out of here." And so, we went off and formed our own theatre company in Hollywood. I left home. I wasn't speaking to my parents anymore and I was living in the basement of a theater. Girls were opening the trapdoor in the theater floor and lowering me down doughnuts and French fries. I was broke. We were all broke and living with girls. Every girl I seemed to meet that was single in New York had a cat with a stinky-ass cat box, and the whole apartment smelled like cat shit. You know, you'd sleep on her couch until she got tired of you. And then we'd get a job and everybody like, like, fucking smoke signals and drums knew you had a job. They'd walk up to you and go, "Hey, I heard, man." Can I have a little more light, please? Let's see, I met Robert back in 1972, I think it was, or '73, and got to know each other well, and we had a lot of fun. Just a bunch of crazy guys on stage, all kinds of shenanigans going on. I remember going to a party with all the football players. And there were like ten guys for every one girl at the party. And all the guys got really sick and drunk and throwing up from the beer kegs. And the next weekend, I was invited to a drama department party. And it was ten girls for every one guy. Not beer kegs but mixing cocktails. And there weren't a lot of straight guys there. Kind of a "don't ask, don't tell" time. And I, it was... that was a very exotic, kind of eye-opening experience for me. Another perk about being in the theater is you're like playing many different characters during the course of a two-and-a-half-hour play. What happens invariably is that you run off to the side of the stage, and you all strip and you put on your next costume. And you could be standing right next to a young lady - who was stripping. - Really? Not that you were paying any attention, but, you know, occasionally you just kind of... glance like that. That's probably not... it's... it's probably not... um, I shouldn't say that nowadays. That about does that for me. I went back to college after that and was very successful there, and that's the beginning of my professional life. But I became dissatisfied and disaffected with the politics of theater. I was naive enough to think the theater was free of that and pure and... and fairness prevailed, and of course it's just like any other business. And I returned to Hollywood. Betsy, my first wife. We were high school sweethearts. I can still remember seeing her, you know, get in my car in high school to take her to the movies, with her, you know, her surfer girl sun-streaked hair, and her sunburned, you know, shoulders, and I was kind of a bad boy. And then we patched it up. And then I went off to go to college. And then she wound up at that college, and we sort of came back together again. I think I'd... I'd... I'd matured just enough that I thought maybe, maybe, maybe Betsy and I are meant to be, you know. We'd known each other for so long, it felt like... when you're young, it felt like forever. And so, we made a go of it. I don't think she ever understood how serious I was about being an actor, how much I loved it, and I was so sure of what I wanted and what I needed. I think Betsy kind of wanted us to, you know, come back to California and have a house and a picket fence and babies. We tried, but we just... we were just different people by then. And you know, I, you know, we were very young then and that can damage a marriage. And I think we just changed, not necessarily grew apart, because we had a very amicable divorce. You know, we just got married too young. I had retained an agent who'd seen me doing Hello, Dolly, and I went on my first interview, and I got a starring role in a movie. 1973, Buster and Billie, which was sort of a strange, romantic, and brutal true story about a couple of teenagers in the American South, post-World War Two. He definitely made an impression on me, even at that age. He didn't look like a movie actor and the performance was really special. And it's not a genre film in any way. It's a coming-of-age drama, but it's kind of intense. I beat out a ton of people for that part. I found out later, some of the people that... that were up to that role, that Who's Who in Hollywood. I had this great Emmy award-winning makeup man, Del Armstrong, and my character was an albino who idolized and sidekicked this, this older boy. In the form of the very hunky Jan Michael Vincent. Well, you're talkin' to the Lone Ranger here. I ride alone, kemo sabe. My albino character doesn't like being an albino and he dyes his hair black, uses shoe polish. We wanted it to look like an old crew cut, but my hair doesn't do that. We go to this great Russian wig maker in the San Fernando Valley, and she's got an entire mantelpiece full of Emmy awards and Oscars. And there in this room is John Wayne's hair and Jimmy Stewart's hair. She's got everybody's hairpiece and everybody's toupee. She tried a couple of them on me. And Alan Arkin had just done Catch-22. Well, I got Alan Arkin's toupee. And we're going to wear contact lenses to make my eyes pink. First day starring in a movie, I get the contact lenses in, and they're colored pink to show that my eyes are green. Pink and green together make brown. I look more like an albino with my own eyes. And if I squint a little bit, then it's... it works, you know. So I'm in my first movie now, and I gotta get my courage with the director. And I go, "Dan, this just doesn't look right to me. I don't know if I can act in these things." And he goes, "Robert, take them out. They don't look right. Your own eyes are good. The windows of the soul." First minute on a set, pop them out, my eyes stop watering, action, nailed the first scene. Again it's that thing, it's that an adult, someone famous, someone tried and true and tested listening to you. And that's why they're good, because they know when to listen and telling me that, and now my confidence is through the ceiling. They had the after party of my premiere at Chasen's in Beverly Hills, which is the restaurant and it was like Who's Who of show business in there at any given night. My father went without me. I couldn't attend because I was doing another job. I was off on location. My father really kind of saw this world and realized that I was doing really well in it. But it was I think just seeing the family name, single card that really touched him. And we were off and running. It's fun now to go back through Robert's early movies. I actually appreciated Robert from the very beginning. Is it a cop? You're gonna wish I was. At that time, Robert was building a nice gallery of characters as a character actor. I was a character actor in the theater, and I was a character actor on film, and I understand those roles. So I get best friend, pissant cowboy, scuzzy little junky boy, and I'm getting lots and lots of screen time with those roles. Hands on the counter, asshole. I did a little filler job for the great American director Robert Aldrich who did What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? and The Longest Yard with Burt Reynolds. They did this movie called the Hustle. Real, dirty, dark contemporary noir, and I'm hired to play the guy that kills Burt Reynolds in the end, this just sort of random killing. And one of the shots they want is that Dirty Harry shot, that great camera looking down the barrel of a gunshot. Prop man put in too much of a load. So when they get back for the shot of me actually shooting Burt, Burt's a couple of feet away from me. I fire the gun and Burt's toupee goes... "Whoo, whoo, whoo." I didn't even know Burt wore a toupee then. I'm like, "Oh my god." Burt invites me into his trailer. Burt pours me a shot of Bushmills. Burt says, "Now, kid, don't worry about that. That wasn't your fault." He goes, "You gotta be as mean and pimply and junky as you can be. Because the meaner and nastier you are, the more the audience is going to feel bad about my death." And this is the biggest star of the '70s telling me this, someone of power and major stardom speaking to me one on one, making me feel good, taking this pressure off me after that horrible accident. We go back in, and we shoot it. Get in! Come on! And it's a great moment in the film. The first time I noticed Robert Englund in a movie was in Bob Rafelson's Stay Hungry. Now, from the man who directed Five Easy Pieces comes Stay Hungry, an extraordinary new film that takes you into a fascinating world. It was like Who's Who. The great Bob Rafelson, who had just come off of Five Easy Pieces. Jeff Bridges, one of his early great roles. Arnold Schwarzenegger, you know, and I know Arnold Schwarzenegger has done a brief cameo in a Robert Altman movie called The Long Goodbye, and he's done a documentary called Pumping Iron, which is the beginning of the fitness fad worldwide. And this movie is the first movie to address that. Lots and lots of wonderful people. And me, I'm one of the stars. I'm like fourth or fifth billing. Robert played a bodybuilder in that. Tank top and all. He's a little guy but, you know, he'd been a swimmer. What you trying to say? Thor didn't tell me nothing about it. Well, he told me. It's better if you don't have nothing on your stomach. There were wonderful actors in that film, and just this amazing crosscurrent of Hollywood culture, the '60s and the '70s all coming together. As Jimmy Karen said, it was Arnold Schwarzenegger before he could say money. Arnold, who was like, this is at the absolute peak of his beauty as this sculpted man. And Arnold's brilliant and funny. We all came back to Hollywood. We were going to help Arnold out because we all fell in love with him. Arnold already, through his endorsements from bodybuilding, owned what is considered Ocean Park now. He was such a shrewd, savvy businessman. So, immediately, we all realize he was already vastly successful. It's hard to give up. I'd rather stay hungry. I remember walking through onto this set, and there were tumbleweeds and a two-story Victorian wooden rundown house that was supposedly in the desert somewhere in Texas. And then, in the on the porch, there was a monkey with bald spots all over and picking his hair, and he was mad, and he was rattling in his cage. It was one of those roadside attraction places that they had in the '40s in that kind of newly mobile national highway system USA. "Last stop for gas, 500 yards on the right, see the giant iguana and the bats from hell." So it's one of those places off on this side road where obviously Tobe Hooper's families, and guests, and victims will show up. Eaten Alive was my first horror film, and it was called Death Trap. We had to change the title because of the famous play. I get this part. And you have to remember in the '70s, my go-to stereotype was redneck, Western, neutral sidekick. And so I did my little pissant cowboy and I got the role. Get off my property! Aw, look at that, done ruffled his feathers. Eaten Alive was awesome. You know, 'cause I'm a big Tobe Hooper fan and I didn't realize it was Robert until, of course, you know, after the fact and looking back on stuff. Howdy, ma'am? The name's Buck. We had to finish the movie without Tobe. Talk around the set was it had something to do with Tobe not making it violent enough. Tobe Hooper? You know, leave him alone. You'll... you'll see it when he edits together. The only thing I regret is I had to really wrestle with a giant rubber alligator. The day we were going to do the scene with making love and... and then him getting up and going outside and getting eaten, that was the nude scene for me. And that's the day the producer comes in and goes, "Gotta tell you something. Tobe Hooper's not going to be here to direct this." He goes, "I am," and I went, "Oh, my, no." I was really scared. But Robert was really supportive. He was really there for me because I was really nervous. He kept me calm. Something about him just made me feel at ease. Yeah, apparently in the Japanese release, there's actually in the middle of one of my scenes, they go beyond and there's actually like a sexual insert shot. No pun intended. Oh, okay. And... and I'm telling everyone right now, it's not me. It's not me. Name's Buck. I'm raring to fuck. Let's just get it over with. I sort of thought we could, uh, try something new. "My name's Buck and I'm here to fuck." I didn't even realize that's where Quentin got it for Kill Bill. So you're starting to see Robert's influence echoing through pop culture. My name's Buck and I'm here to fuck. I auditioned for Kill Bill for the orderly. Quentin has told me he loves Eaten Alive. He has a great aesthetic for grindhouse, and I have a nice talk with Quentin. And my first take was not what he wanted. But then I had to do it again. And I... it was so dim that I put on my reading glasses. And I put on my reading glasses and it really... it changes me. You know, and I become the, you know, the druggist at the store or something, at the pharmacy. So, Quentin, confused, he hired me. My name's Buck and I'm here to fuck. Mornin', Beebo! I'm feelin' lucky! I'm starvin'. The third of the trio of '70s Southern rednecks that I played was Last of the Cowboys, also known as The Great Smokey Roadblock. You have to remember, trucking movies were real big in the '70s. Keep on truckin'. I had the honor of starring with the great Henry Fonda, arguably one of the best actors in American film history. Also in that film, I had a lovely young leading lady, Susan Sarandon, in one of her earlier roles. It was sort of a double whammy for me, this, uh, this working character actor getting to work with one of America's greatest film actors and soon-to-be Oscar-winning Susan Sarandon. I had met William Katt at a Saturday audition, and it was my third or fourth callback for Carrie. Creepy Carrie! Creepy Carrie! They were liking me for the John Travolta role. And I believe that day it was myself, William Katt, and Nancy Allen, who eventually married Brian DePalma. Obviously, Travolta got the part and was fabulous in it. Young Robert Englund was obsessed with George Lucas and Zoetrope and Francis Ford Coppola. We idolized these guys. And we had heard rumors about Apocalypse Now in the acting community, and I managed to wrangle an audition. And I wanted to read for the cook. I dressed military. I had a tank top on, an old green military thrift shop tank top, wife-beater, and I had dog tags and I was 170 pounds of muscle. I had an old military shirt with the sleeves rolled up on over my sleeveless t-shirt. So I had a kind of cool look about me. They said, "No, you're too young." They looked at me for a minute and said, "You know, they may want to see you across the hall. George Lucas is working on a new project." Scene four, take one. Chick's out again, there's no mistake. You can't find a major? I found it, it's just... it's just not there. George Lucas and Brian De Palma were casting at the same time. So all those casting sessions, they held it together and I think they saw every up-and-coming young actor and young actress in Hollywood at the time. They wanted Han Solo to originally be kind of like a cool older uncle. You know, that kind of guy that would, you know, give you your first beer. Now they were kind of bobbing and weaving. They didn't know whether to keep it older or maybe have Han be somebody almost Luke's age, you know. It could be a contemporary of Luke's but you know, a bad boy. Over my dead body. Now that we have seen Harrison Ford as Han Solo, you cannot picture anybody else in that role. I'm sure Robert would have given a great performance. But it's just like asking, "Can you picture somebody else as Freddy Krueger?" You have nothing to worry about. Immediately, they thought I was too young. And they took a Polaroid of me, I think, and maybe they filmed me with, you know, with a lampshade off on Super 8. I can't remember. But I do remember there being a table in there and I saw the sides for Luke Skywalker. I didn't have sides. They just took a picture of me. I didn't even read for Han. But I stole the sides for Luke Skywalker. I get home and my girlfriend's in the back bedroom typing away. She's working on a script that would later become Lost Boys. Mark Hamill, my buddy. Always at our house. And Mark's entrée was always, he always brought a six-pack of Heineken. And I come in and I... I... I gave him the sides. I said, "Mark, you might really be right for this." He got on the phone with his agent, got an interview I think that very next day. Went in, and the rest is history. We have to find the rebels. What we're carrying belongs to them. Mark Hamill... Darn him! It was almost mine. It was that... It's... it's a great '70s moment for how everything came together and blended together and how things bounced off each other. You know, it's just interesting how that all works. Well, back in the '70s, I wasn't working constantly, and there were some unemployment checks. Sometimes I'd help out friends in front of and behind the camera. My neighbor who lived downstairs worked with Tommy Lee Wallace and John Carpenter. And I offered to help him one day. He wanted me to gather leaves and stuff them in garbage bags, to all these dead leaves from the gutter and the streets so he could go off, throw them in front of a camera and have them blow through the air in front of a lovely young actress named Jamie Lee Curtis in another iconic '70s movie... Halloween. I professionally knew what Robert was up to and watched his career grow. We were all kind of growing at the same time. But obviously, I didn't really have an opportunity to spend time with him again until we did Big Wednesday. Big Wednesday, the day you face your own biggest challenge. The day you risk it all. I had idolized some of those surfers as a child, that... whose story Big Wednesday is. And John Milius, the great John Milius, the writer/director, was also at Malibu at that special, special moment of time. John directed it and... and cast all of us in this... another tribe of guys that was living on that ribbon of life right on the coast during the '60s. So it's his memory, but I remember some of what he remembered. We... we're not that too far off in age. It wasn't so much about the party scene, but it was about tasty waves. So we would always hunt, so you'd have to get in your car and run up and down the coast. That was my life. And I know, I know Robert shared that kind of life for a long time. So when I met Robert, I remember there was a perfect thing because he shakes hands when somebody's going off to war, and he has lines, so when I met Robert the first time, I shook his hand and I said, "Stay casual, Barlow." Stay casual, Barlow. But what was fascinating about it was he didn't go "Oh, I'm glad you've seen one of my other movies." What he said was, very seriously, "Oh, I love that movie." Robert has this wonderful speaking voice. He was the narrator of Big Wednesday, which a lot of people don't know. In the old days, I remember a wind that would blow down through the canyons. It was a hot wind called a Santana. The narration was so rhapsodic and beautiful, and Robert spoke it so wonderfully. My friends and I would sleep in our cars and the smell of the offshore wind would often wake us. I... I kind of pinched my nose for it, just a little bit. "I remember the three friends," you know, and "Santa Ana winds." I didn't get it to... I didn't dude it like... like Sean Penn. I didn't go full, "Dude." Oh, gnarly! But I did just put enough of it on it, but I also wanted it to be as if it was a remembrance of things past and give it the kind of class that... the gentle poetry in the narration required that John Milius had written. It was about... their friendship was the film, and it was another guy standing just outside of that, talking about their friendship. I hadn't done a part that small in ten years. I had worked at Warner Brothers a lot. I felt comfortable taking a pay cut. And I know that story that they told. Big Wednesday for me is literally the last day of my youth. This is the road to Potter's Bluff. Maybe you've been there. Clean, picturesque, full of old-fashioned friendliness. I met Robert Englund in some casting sessions when I was casting some television projects in Los Angeles. But Gary's hired me several times. I mean, we did that... we had done Mysterious Two, the television movie. And Robert came in and I found him really interesting as an actor and as a person. I just really liked him. And I really went to the wall to convince everybody that this guy could hold his own against Noah Beery. Reverend MacLeish? You know, whose name was on that tent permit? Yeah. Well, he up and died six months before it was issued. And I was right. And he did, and he was absolutely fantastic. And then I hired Robert again on Dead & Buried. By the time I saw Dead & Buried for the first time, I was already a big Robert Englund fan and just so excited to see him outside of Freddy. Any chance I could see him outside of Freddy, I was just fascinated. Did you get a good gander at that face, Danny? Yes, Harry, I did. I actually tailored that part for him. Actually, I don't even think in the... in an earlier draft that Harry had a name. He was just the tow truck driver, and he just had a few scenes. And what we did was, you know, what I did is I sat down and I expanded the part of... of Harry and gave it to Robert. Gary was wonderful with all of us, you know, and we were kind of, like, treated like an ensemble. It was still that moment of time in Hollywood, where even if you had a small role, they wouldn't bring you in for two days and work you really hard. You'd be run of the show. So I was there for the whole shoot. Listen, I just pulled a late-model Ford out of the water down by the south beach. Yeah? It appears she come off the bluff. When we were doing the setup, he had the kid's airplane in his hand, and he was sitting there flicking the propeller. It was almost kind of an ad-lib of his, and I said, "That's great." That's the thing about Robert, is that his dialogue delivery is so natural. It's just so real. The great Jack Albertson is in that movie. Lisa Blount plays this sort of death nurse in that, and really, I think that may be the original death nurse performance in the genre of films. And what's funny is the character who gets the needle in his eye, his name was Freddy. Stan Winston also worked that film, the great Stan Winston. That was one of my very early effects makeup experiences. It's also one of my favorite posters of any film I've done. And occasionally I'll get a European version of that poster with beautiful signing, you know, at one of the conventions. It's just an amazing poster, kind of a classic. Roger Corman had just purchased some warehouses in Venice, California. So it was... all these warehouses had been converted into Rogers's new low-budget studio. Roger was doing sci-fi, getting... getting in on that sci-fi bandwagon. He knew what the audiences wanted. Prepare yourself for... ...Galaxy of Terror. I did Galaxy of Terror because there was going to be an actors' strike. I had the shittiest, crappiest little dressing room. It was like two theater flats, pin-hinged together, couple of bent coat hangers hanging on a dowel, and a little stained plastic chair. That was my dressing room. Across from me was a little makeshift office for the art department. And there was a guy with scraggly long blond hair in there, and he would be drawing all the time creatures for the show, and he was the art director. And he would throw balls of paper out and I would grab them and open them up; they were great drawings. Well, the guy was James Cameron, who went on to some success. And he'd covered the walls in Styrofoam boxes from the dumpsters, like... it looked like... it looked as good as Star Wars. What is it? Nothing. I keep seeing something... then nothing. I've been a huge Robert Englund fan for a long time, but the first time I saw him was in Galaxy of Terror, which is a... this little sci-fi gem that a lot of people don't know about, which annoys me. Of all my movies, Galaxy of Terror and Ford Fairlane have the two craziest pop culture casts. We had the star of Happy Days, Erin Moran, Grace Zabriskie from Twin Peaks, Ray Walston, and then the great, late Sid Haig. I live and I die by the crystals. Sid was, you know, just a sweetheart. I was off to do my Vietnam movie, Don't Cry, It's Only Thunder. Sid had done a hundred movies in the Philippines, and Sid wrote down all these places for me to go, the best sushi bar, the best Chinese restaurant. He was like this sort of like, back then for me, just sort of like a mentor, big brother, about, you know, the crazy world of being a character actor internationally, which was about to happen for me. You know, Don't Cry, It's Only Thunder, I call it my Vietnam movie. And it's a true story. The boy it's about was actually the technical adviser on Apocalypse Now. It's really, I think, a worthy, amazing, and an important story about the other aspect of Vietnam, which is why Francis Ford Coppola insisted that Paul Henssler, who wrote this project about his life, make it into a film. My character is into taking drugs. He's a very confused and misguided and a very unhappy person because of the situation that he finds himself in, doing autopsies on casualties in Vietnam. My name was Tripper because I was an ambulance driver, and I was sort of this stoner. One of the things that we know now about Vietnam, is a lot of young men went that far from home, and that was the first place they'd ever been high, because drugs were everywhere. So that was sort of my character. The guys that just kept themselves lightly buzzed all the time. Ain't she a little young for you, Brian? Goddammit, haven't you ever heard of knockin'? We just clicked right away. He's a very impassioned actor and I was too, so it was a perfect match. Dennis just sort of taught me how to go on location. And I had big cases that musicians travel with. And he had a couple of things from home that he needed. I remember he had silver framed pictures of... of... of his friends and his family. I brought a boom box with me with two speakers. I know that Robert checked this out and was very like, "Whoa, look how you roll." You know? Dennis and I went into town one night, and Dennis had cut the sleeves off of one of the military shirts. And that's... we were on a... on a pub crawl, and we got arrested because Dennis got busted. You're not allowed to mutate the uniform. I remember the guards, the MPs got us, and Dennis says, "You can't arrest us. We're movie stars." "Dennis, that's not going to work." What? And Susan St. James got us out, and I think she had to promise some DJ... she was going to be DJ on Armed Services Radio in the Philippines. You know, she had to like, you know, a bunch of tapes with her. Hi, this is Susan St. James, and you're listening to the Eagles here on KNAVYN. Or something like that. We hung out quite a lot and had a good time, yeah, trying to find these guys and to not make this a morality tale about the sweet Americans who were saving orphans in Vietnam. It's really, I think, a worthy and amazing and an important story about the other aspect of Vietnam. There's a great deal of resonance in it today, of what you do with the collateral damage. And is it collateral damage or are they people? And of course... the creatures! Television at the time of V was mostly something I didn't pay much attention to. I loved movies, TV was kind of the same old same old all the time, and then along comes V. Suddenly, we're talking about lizard aliens underneath human skin splitting open and the like, and I loved it. V was about this alien species that has come here supposedly to be our friends, but they have a dark agenda just like the Nazis did, when they rolled into northern Europe. I have a dear friend, and he was... he was close to the casting director, Phyllis Hoffman. And Phyllis had brought me in on several projects and brought me in for V. It was to play this alien who had a proclivity for malapropping, for using the wrong word to mean another word. So I was going to be comedy relief, and I go, "That's a lot to parcel right there." Robert walked in, and I thought, "Oh, this is just so right. He looks so right." So we started reading together and it was like, bang, this is the guy that I had in my mind when I created the character of Willie. I said to Ken, you know, I said, "Give me some help here. What... how do you see him?" You know? And I remember Ken saying two words: "Gene Wilder." And that just was so out of the left field for me, but I love Gene Wilder. Robert absolutely captured that desire to please and... and to be involved from the very first time we see him, in the scene with Jason Bernard where they run into each other, and Jason is this big, gruff son of a gun who just doesn't like these aliens taking their jobs. And he bumps into Robert and says, "What the hell are you doing?" And Robert just takes his glasses off... oh, first the dark glasses so that we could see his eyes... and he says, "I-I need help." Help what? I am just... Just what? Yes. Oh, get out of the way. Damn stupid alien. And he absolutely got the moment that I was looking for. He was somebody who was not menacing or dark or evil and didn't really believe in the leaders' plans but rather was more connected to humanity. He was the first alien that really kind of took humanity's side, I felt like. You know, he fell in love, um, but he was so innocent. I think it was his innocence in V that really, kind of made me fall in love with the character and I think made everybody fall in love with the character. And, you know, you kind of counteract him with... Diana Jane Badler's like the super evil one. He was just this nice mixture of like, you know, humor and innocence and sweetness. Just... just what everybody wants to find in a guy that doesn't exist in real people. Hello, Harmony. Robert has a great ease and facility that was really fun to be around. And we hit it off right away because we're both talkers. You want a burger? No. Don't you guys ever eat? Sometimes. I love the juxtaposition of the way Kenny Johnson wrote the two characters because I played sort of the salt of the earth. I, with the catering truck, you know, innocent, very grounded, and he was this confused alien who was on the side of good and didn't speak English. So it was two great, very different, you know, characters, Mutt and Jeff, you know, Abbott and Costello, which is a perfect combination for a great, great relationship. I think they look real snappy in those uniforms. Robert and I worked together before either one of us were known for our characters. And I did a couple episodes as one of his lizard men or something. I was in a makeup but, you know, technically, one of his bad guys. V was the number one mini-series in America, with ratings as good as Roots. It was my first sort of big introduction to, wow, television really reaches a lot of people. And V did two things for me. It made me international overnight and people knew my name overnight. He began to get recognized. And that's a moment when an actor transitions from being just a working actor to being a recognizable star. You know, I was flying over for awards and film festivals and publicity. So it was... it was just a great experience for me. I had a window within my schedule and the only project that really fit was this thing called A Nightmare on Elm Street. An awkward, strange title. I knew a little bit about Wes Craven. I had him filed under, like David Lynch, "artist, dark, strange." So when I went on the interview, I was sort of expecting Rasputin or some goth guy. Of course, Wes is sitting there dressed in Ralph Lauren, pinwale corduroys, brilliant, erudite, smart, puns a lot, likes... likes corny jokes. What's interesting about Freddy Krueger is that when Wes was first looking for this character, he was auditioning stuntmen. He wasn't even looking for an actor. Interesting fact, I had, way back before Robert was hired, had a meeting with Wes Craven because I had done The Hills Have Eyes II. Wes knew that I had burn scars, and he said he was developing a new character that is going to be a horror character who's been burned. And he goes, "I'm thinking of using someone with real burns scars." When Kane tells that story now and you just start to wonder, what if it had gone that way? But everything always works out like it should. I was in the middle of spring surfing. I was tan, I had long curly blonde hair, and I thought, "You know, I don't feel like I look anything like what they're going to want. I'm not big enough. I'm not scary enough." There's nothing threatening about Robert, at least in his demeanor when you're meeting him. So I went, and I took the dipstick from under the hood of my car and I got some oil on my hands. And I greased my hair back straight to my scalp. Realized my buddy had left a cigarette butt in my ashtray in my car. So I took a little saliva, and I mixed it with the cigarette ash and I put circles under my eyes. They looked very natural, just kind of discolored, like I am permanently now. Now my face looked long and lean. I got in there and I just let Wes do all the talking. I kept my mouth shut. And I played... a staring game with Wes. And as long as he talked, I tried not to blink. And it worked. This... is God. You really look for actors that you think can break through all the veneer of civilization in one way or the other, either as victim or as, you know, perpetrator. There's that sort of Kosovo factor of people that at one moment can be nurturing their children, the next moment slashing each other's throats. And so, you look for that willingness on the part of an actor to expose that and to be cruel or to be inventive in the cruelty. Quite often, it's the person that's the most gentle or the most civilized. Now I'm going to be truthful and honest as I can here. People are so kind and nice, and they say that Wes thought I was the only person that understood when he pitched the idea to me, but it could have been as simple as me having a thin face and Wes being paranoid about the makeup effects and how they would work. Just knowing that my skinny thin face when you put the foam latex on it would still be natural in size, in ratio with my broad shoulders. The day that I saw him really in his makeup was... it was part of that high school scene where I go into the basement and I see Freddy Krueger for the first time and I think it was the first time I saw him in makeup. And maybe Wes had planned it that way. I mean, if he had, it was really genius because I turned around and I see him in his makeup and it's dark and it's really scary. Eugh! Creepy. So I remember thinking, "Wow, that's what Freddy's gonna look like." It was what I'd pictured, but it was shocking to see it in person. I mean, it worked well for my character, death being the first person to fight Freddy. Aaahh! You can't have Freddy Krueger without Robert Englund. It's Robert who makes that character. You can see the way Nick Castle moves when he's playing Michael Myers. You can see the way Kane Hodder moves. When he's Jason he's got, like, very specific body language. But Freddy's the one that, under all that makeup, Robert really has to act. Watch this. Robert said, "Well, you know, I've just done this movie. I'm covered in makeup. I don't have many lines. I don't know. Maybe I should get into real estate. What should I do?" My feeling is the monster characters, they don't become iconic because of the writers. They don't become iconic necessarily because of the directors. They don't even become iconic necessarily because of the makeup, although it certainly helps. You can have all those factors. If the guy behind the makeup isn't selling it right, isn't convincing, isn't himself convinced, then it doesn't work. Like most actors, you don't, you don't realize that this is going to be a life-changing moment. A Nightmare on Elm Street, the first one, was really a big breakthrough for everybody. I first saw Nightmare on Elm Street and I don't know if I had ever been that scared in a movie. It just really struck a nerve with audiences all over the world. I was frightened. I mean, I was stunned because it was the first time in a long time where the process of the filmmaking disappeared, and I just was blown away. It was different in so many ways because the concept of it was just so like outrageously beyond every other slasher movie. It's a very strange movie. Such an offbeat movie. I remember really being blown away by how popular a horror film could feel. People were shrieking, laughing, enjoying themselves. I remember going to my girlfriend's house at the time to watch Nightmare on Elm Street, and I'm unabashedly not afraid to say that I was nervous. And to watch that and try to keep my cool in front of my girlfriend was challenging enough. It was just so imaginative, such strong characters, and I'd never seen like a villain like Freddy. He was the first real slasher film icon that had style. The movie influenced me so much that I wrote a prequel and sent it to Bob Shea when I was 14. I ended up interning at New Line when I was 19. I worked there for 11 years and that's where I made Final Destination, so I... I literally credit Nightmare on Elm Street as starting my career in the business. I went to see Nightmare on Elm Street with a girl, and I was just blown away by the imaginative characteristics of the film and his character. Six months later, I get a call from my friend Bart Mixon, who was working with Mark Sjostrom, who invited me to come work on Nightmare on Elm Street 2. I was going to work with, you know, the big new horror star Robert Englund. He brought so much into Freddy the way he built Freddy. And then you see the footage that they tried to use in Nightmare on Elm Street 2 with the doppelganger, and it's night and fucking day. I remember being at a meeting at the production office, and they were actually kicking around whether it was worth bringing Englund back to be Freddy. I guess the norm at that time was using stuntmen for, you know, Jason or Mike Myers or whatever. I mean, there's just like this asshole in a cosplayer outfit, you know, kind of walking out of the steam and you're like, "That's so not Robert Englund. What the fuck is going on?" "Why hire an actor and then bury him in makeup?" It's like, "That's why you hire an actor." Thankfully, I think the main producers recognized what he brought to the first film and I'm sure there would have never been a part three, you know, had that happened. And he brings that character back to life. That's special, man. And that's... it's the gift of a true actor. We got special work to do here, you and me. My actual first meeting with Robert Englund was on set after working for about three months. He had just finished having his makeup done, and I turn over to see him tapping his finger on a mirror. Oh, Mister Knify hands. Mister Knify hands is here, oy vey. He came up full Chevy Chase style and said, I like it. As Freddy. There might have been drugs involved. What a rush. When I got to work with Robert on Nightmare Three... You. Oh, my God. He was the elder, but I was like the mid-elder, and then we had the younger kids, and we both took a much more protective attitude about the kids. He's often in a fantastic image of himself: puppeteer in the sky, or he's a giant snake coming out of a floor swallowing Patricia Arquette. The effects on part three are fucking amazing. And so, having him on the set as himself, there weren't that many days of that. He's larger than life in a way. He is a character in that dream. He's not the actual, real, pathetic, strange little man that was Freddy Krueger. I asked Robert, I said, "Are you a child murderer or a child molester? There's a big difference here." I mean, the guy was a fucking child molester. There really isn't much sympathy for Freddy Krueger. I mean, kids love Freddy Krueger. There's something about him that everyone has sort of dismissed the child molester part and thought, "Oh, this is a guy who kills you in your dreams." He became the boogeyman. And the fact that Robert still managed to make him not just horrific, but likable, where you wanted to see more of him and you're not just hating him and waiting for him to die or go away, that's everything. And that's why Freddy will last. And New Line quickly moved away from anything molesting, which is wise. So he just murders them, which is bad enough. I did notice that there were little kids coming to my door dressed as Freddy and that's when I really realized that it had hit this pop culture place. When I was in his dressing room with him and we were talking, there was a huge crowd and they started rocking the trailer. And he was so great with them. He went out there and he was dressed in his... in his stuff, you know, in his outfit, and he went out there and he was like, "You guys gotta quit knocking the thing or you're gonna knock me over. But I appreciate you all out here." You know, it was really nice and it was scary. I mean, we thought we were gonna be tipped over. Freddy Krueger right here. Nightmare on Elm Street. Yeah? This is my Freddy Krueger mask. I made it myself, the sculpting on up. This is my claw. He doesn't become a rock star of horror because he's a child murderer, molester. It's because Robert Englund has so much humor and so much personality and so much joie de morte, instead of vivre. You can't have any film or any style of film without having a charismatic person at the helm. I love... just loved the way that Robert was able to juggle humor with horror. The humor was very rare in the first one, but it was there. And it became embellished in the sequels afterwards, in some people's opinion. Freddy does speak. Says "bitch" a lot. Bon appétit, bitch. But it's Robert playing this scarred character who has this wicked, nasty sense of humor. And it really appeals to a young audience because they don't think about mortality, and they enjoy the rending of these bodies on screen by the bladed glove of Freddy Krueger. I don't believe in fairy tales. At that point, I had a little boy who had nightmares, and kids that have nightmares always want the thing that scares them; that's what they seek. So he was always wanting all this Freddy Krueger stuff. So it was such a trip. He wouldn't understand "I work with that guy." In fact, it would probably have freaked him out. For the same reason you'll embrace black metal in the hopes that your parents would hate it, you'll embrace outrageous violence in films. And so Robert is a de facto uncle to this audience. I mean, I've always said that horror films are to film what rock is to music. By the time Nightmare 3 came out and Robert was a guest VJ on MTV and you had the Dokken song, interestingly enough, that was the first time I met him. When that came... came on MTV, I was like... whooh! ♪ We're the dream warriors ♪ I lost my mind. This was like a real deal, serious, serious video. I've always said that Freddy is rock and roll, and Pinhead is a requiem mass. We made a lot of fun of him and what he had become and what Freddy had become, and why the pop culture around Freddy was just so, you know, it was just really amusing and... and crazy. Gah! And he's Robert fucking Englund, for God's sake. Guys, Freddy Krueger, the star of Nightmare on Elm Street, portrayed by this very fine actor... not a school teacher, Debbie... Mr. Robert Englund. Please welcome the man who plays Freddy Krueger, Robert Englund. - Robert Englund. - Robert Englund here. Do you like your movies? Yeah, I do. I... I... I think there's a, I think there's a need for these movies. I hate to say this, Freddy, but I can't go and see your movies. I am too afraid. Well... It's a complete accident. It's a happy accident. The double whammy of me being an international television science fiction character that everybody loved, that's very, very different from the dark boogeyman of these incredibly imaginative and original horror films that I did that became a franchise. There was just so many things you could buy. Record albums, and sweaters of course, and hats. There's just so much that they ended up marketing that as much as it's nice to see Freddy be a rock star, I thought that it kind of... there was something cheap... that cheapened the whole thing by it. The reason that I... a benefactor from this gift that just keeps giving is because simultaneously another happy accident occurred. First, there was early cable, and I was on cable, parts one, two, three; early video, the mom-and-pop video stores. People would stay home now on weekends, save money. They'd let the kids pick a movie. Well, of course, the kids would pick Nightmare on Elm Street 1 or Nightmare on Elm Street 2 or three or four, and they'd bring it home on a Saturday, Mom and Dad sit around and they'd let them watch Mom and Dad get scared, have a pizza. And then there was Freddy's Nightmares. I mean, like Freddy had his own television show. Freddy killed children, and he had a television show, which everybody loved. I was lured into the television series by a number of factors. Not the least of which was money, I'll be honest. I was lured in specifically because they were gonna give me my DGA card, my Directors Guild of America card. I directed several episodes. I did not have to give Robert much direction. He knew Freddy better than I did. If the suspense doesn't get you, I will. I was in like a motel room with my family and... and we were clicking through the channels, and it was like an ad for call Freddy at one point where it was like a like "1-800, call Freddy and he'll talk to you on the phone." Join the Freddy Fan Club. Freddy Krueger has a special message just for you. It was like phone sex, but it was with Freddy instead, you know. Robert was willing to make fun of himself a great deal and I think he knew how... how absurd and crazy it was that Freddy Krueger has now been this worldwide phenomenon. But he loves it. I never set out to be an actor to sign autographs or... or drive a Mercedes, but I must confess that I do like the attention. My mother died early on in the Freddy phenomenon. She'd see me on chat shows, on talk shows. Or she'd be watching the late-night talk shows and Johnny Carson, or someone would do a Freddy Krueger joke. You see Mayor Bradley's in a little bit of trouble? He declared today Freddy Krueger Day. It had begun to enter the vernacular then, and so she was receptive to that. But then she passed and didn't really see the sort of peak of the phenomenon, but my father got to experience a lot of that. And the only time my father ever visited me, I could have been, you know, not wearing makeup, I could have been at any one of dozens of other projects, but he came the day that I was crucified with Makita screws on three-quarter-inch plywood. That was the first project I worked with Robert on, Nightmare 4. This is the biggest sequence, it's the finale, it's the end. Roll it. Souls burst out of him and get their vengeance on Robert. And I had this animatronic chest and torso on. Adjacent to me was a giant, King Kong size chest of souls. They were doing a ratio thing with the camera. So I had these phenomenally sculptured special effects makeup heads of my victims, the souls of my victims, moving around and talking and... and their little mouths and their lips would move, and their nostrils would flare, and I could feel the little clockwork mechanisms behind them, you know, tearing at my flesh. I was up there for probably eight hours. We tortured the poor guy. We're shooting all day. He can't move. He's literally glued into that wall in this big animatronic body that's sticking out of his chest. Total trouper. And that's the day my father came to see his son, recruited by Stanford, crucified in makeup with men that had like, there were like wires going up every orifice on my body. You know, "Oh, hi, Dad. How are ya?" It wasn't embarrassing as much as it was surreal and funny. But looking back on it, it was a rather strange way to have your father see you working as an artist. But you know, behind the scenes, it's a different story. I think I ended up partying with Robert more than I ended up working with him. I very well could have partied with those guys. I just don't remember. I like it! I was in the makeup trailer, and I was watching him get his makeup on, which was elaborate. And we would talk about things like, you know, acting and Shakespeare, and I was thinking, "God, I have to be afraid of him. He's so... he's so sweet." But then when I saw him in the scene, when I had scenes with him, he becomes this swaggering, sexy almost, villain. I mean, he's got this sexiness about him, I think. That menace has a certain sexual threat to it. And his victims are women, and I mean, they're... that's all built into the character. He had a predator posture, and he comes to your bedroom. He's in your subconscious, so he knows what's in your diary. He knows what you want. He knows your fantasies. That's what's sexy about it. And it's funny because as I said, "I love you so much." And it's like, yay. I know he's going home with me so I really don't have to be jealous about that fabulous Freddiette there with her skirt that stops there and shirt that stops there. Doing a horror film was like one step above like crappy porn. You know, they're like, "Oh, you got a horror film, big deal." But anyhow, we didn't know it was gonna explode. But Robert Englund had become a star and I knew who he was too. And then we're wrapping up the film and he... I say, I go, "Hey, can I get an autograph from you, like people do now?" He says, "Danny, hopefully we'll get to work together again." And then like, three weeks later, we ended up getting Nightmare 5, it became a real thing. So I've been a fan of Robert for a long time. I knew of Nightmare on Elm Street but I had never seen one, but it's kind of like, "I didn't know this shit was this serious." This is a cultural phenomenon. People love Freddy Krueger. And I feel very blessed and fortunate that I even had the opportunity to work with Robert. I mean, he's super nice. I don't consider that I've done six horror movies. I consider I've done one roll. It's a chance, every once in a while, to get it just the way I want it. And it's kind of fun because of Freddy, I can do a little bit of that. I changed the voice. I changed the way I moved. You can't replace him. You can't put somebody else in that makeup. It has to be Robert, and I don't think anyone will accept anybody else. In 50 years, I hope there will be other actors playing and doing a fabulous job at Freddy Krueger. My only problem with Freddy now is that I'm turning down other projects that I'd like to do. When the Freddy project comes alive last year, I had to turn down a great movie in Australia. It's the actor's nightmare, you know, that you can't like divide yourself and split like an amoeba. That's very frustrating. I mean, gosh, you know, I've waited all these years to... to have this problem. All of a sudden, you get a role that defines you, and sometimes people don't allow you to escape the confines of that character. Here was a guy that as a character actor could have, I think, done anything because his skill set is there. However, having done Freddy, it launched him into a kind of American subconscious, and now a worldwide subconscious where he's iconic. And yet it was oddly limiting for him. Robert became so associated with Freddy that Freddy gets the credit for his performance. There's so much more to Robert than Freddy Krueger, and I think if there's any, I'm gonna say downside, is that it's deprived us of seeing him branch out into parts that might have actually also really thrilled us. I can play a lawyer tomorrow if somebody asked me, and I'd be very happy to. Does KISS get sick of playing rock and roll all night, every night? Probably. But that's what everyone's there to see. So in a case like Robert Englund, where you get to play a character like Freddy, you've just completely knocked it out of the park and everybody knows you as that and loves you as that, that's pretty amazing. He is a really talented actor. And I think assumptions get made about horror actors that they're less than, and it's unfair. One of the problems with being, you know, an icon, if you will, or having an iconic part is that you end up holding on to it like it's a life raft, you know, like, you, "Boy, without this, I am nothing." I don't think you get trapped in that role like you used to. I think that it's a bit of a... like a bit of a gift and a curse. It's not a curse, it's a blessing. And I think Robert appreciates that. He has learned to appreciate that as much as I have. At some point... I know I've found this... is that I kind of just have been really happy with the idea that this will be the one part that people know me for, and I have to be okay with that. And I think Robert probably is too. And I think he's been able to handle it quite well. I thought a little bit about fighting it. And there came a point when I absolutely surrendered to it. Partly on the advice of Wes Craven, but also, with myself as an actor, I embraced it. Turn your head slightly. Vacuum off. Keep turning the head now. Robert is such a pro. And it's not just that he's a pro about his own performance. He's one of those film actors who understands film. Robert has probably seen more movies than all of us combined. Oh, one of my favorite films, a 1974 Brian DePalma film, Sisters. After the day's work, he would get out of his whole outfit and we'd all have a couple of beers and go to a small screening room, and he'd draw something to my attention that maybe I wasn't aware of, and I could draw something to his attention that he wasn't thinking about. No matter where you are or what you're talking about... he is just a 100-mile-an-hour ball of ideas. Well, Robert pays attention. It's not all about Robert. It's not all about Freddy. It's not all about that character, but he really understands the machinery of filmmaking, as well as the creative depth of the actor. It goes beyond the actor. Knows where the camera is, knows how close the shot is, knows how to pitch his performance accordingly. So he's hyper-aware of what lens is on the camera, what's the... not just what the angle of view, but what's the lens so that if he takes two steps back on a move, is that going to be really impactful or is it not going to be so impactful? Because the lens selection is going to change that. Right? And so there's a very like interactive way that Robert works with the people around him. People have often talked about how he angles Freddy's glove. It's not a surprise that, you know, he's a director himself, 976-EVIL. I thought I told you not to tell anybody about last night. Mommy said we were blessed by the Lord. I directed my first professional play, I think in 1966. For me, directing film is not as pleasant an experience as I thought, and I'm much more at home directing in the theater. The only offers I ever get are genre. It takes a year off of your life because there's pre-production, and then there's the shoot. Tick-tock tick-tock, the nervous stomach. Time is money. Not... you can't really luxuriate in the creative process like you imagine you can in theater. But I had some wonderful actors. I got to work and direct the late great Sandy Dennis, who literally invented the neurotic female on film. I've enjoyed working with him very, very much. First of all, because he enjoys me, I think. I can justify that experience just for that. On the set of 976-EVIL, I was actually nervous about working on this movie, because I'd heard that the director was an actor, and he was a first-time director, and those can be a pain in the ass, especially in the art department. I was a set decorator. So if they don't know anything, they'll go in, "Oh, that's not how it was in my grandma's house. You have to have this kind of rug." It's like, "Go play with the cameras." I hadn't seen any of the Nightmare movies. There was a Rolling Stone magazine with his picture and I was like, "Okay. Oh, yeah, that's him. Okay." Nancy drew the short straw, and got the grunt job of having to drive the location manager and myself, looking for locations in Hollywood. I had already picked a couple of locations. I would make Nancy drive anyway to those locations. And she got to drive on the freeways for hours and I was slowly falling in love. And this is so creepy now when I think back on it, but I also, I found out where she lived. Hm... Okay. And a couple of nights, I drove... getting my courage up to knock on the door and ask her out. I'd wait and like sit, watch her light go on upstairs, like a Hitchcock movie or something. Okay, fine. I remember taking her to a famous bar across the street from the Formosa. And I kissed her, and my knees almost buckled. I was like a little kid. Because I'd been around. I'd been divorced. I'd come out of a ten-year relationship that wasn't working. I had a lot of, you know, scars. And I was probably 38 years old. I remember saying to her, and I stole this line from an old James Garner-Sally Field movie, "I think I'm in love for the last time in my life." You know, I'm gonna be running on empty. And she said, "Well, you know, clear out your baggage, and call me." And I did. I was on the show when Robert and Nancy met. And I can tell you that by the end of the show, you could hear their heartbeats and you could see the twinkles in their eyes. They were so in love. I saw that this could be serious; that he was a serious man and he had serious intentions for me and... and therefore we wanted to be logical about it. Who is this lovely woman next to you? This is my fiancée, Nancy Booth. We did, and it worked. Nancy, you have strange taste in men. Is he... is he... off screen, is he regular, normal, all of that? Sweet, intelligent, wonderful. Yes. I don't actually think I've seen Robert without Nancy as long as I can remember. They were like two little sweet peas in a pod. She strikes me as someone who can just keep the train running on the tracks, and they just bring out the very best in each other. I think that they're a pretty humble couple but they just happen to live this really rock-star lifestyle. Also contributes to why we don't have children now, because, you know, I wanted to be with him, be traveling the world, so. He worships the ground she walks on. It's a really beautiful thing to see. And I just think they're a really good team together. And here we are, 30 years later, so... I have all kinds of memories about Phantom of the Opera. That was part of a two-picture deal for me with a big international company, Canon Jones 21st century, and it's a family business. Menahem Golan realized that the Phantom of the Opera title, the literary title, had come into public domain, so he thought, "
