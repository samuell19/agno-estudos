The Physician (2013) OCR 24 fps runtime 02:35:06 In the dark ages the art of healing developed in the roman era has been widely forgotten in Europe. There are no doctors, no hospitals, only travelling barbers with poor knowledge. At the same time on the other side of the world medical science is prospering. Based on the novel by Noah Gordon The Physician Back and forth and up and down, left to right for more than one hundred years. But nowhere have I had the pleasure of looking out upon a crowd with prettier girls. Than here in your wonderful Roughdovender. Why do I especially like it here? Because I always lay me best eggs here. Ladies and Lords, from broken bones to teeth rotting down in your jawbone to useless stumps. From pustules on the backside to thick, black fluid in your lungs. No matter the ailment conjured up by the devil to plague us poor Christian folk... Me and me alone has the cure. Me and me alone has the cure! Hey! Hey! That's my bread! - Hey! Come back! - So, come up, you over there, come up, - Hey, that's my bread! - You're up for treatment inside. Dear lord Jesus, have mercy upon us, your poorest children. Protect my sweet Rob from the error that he's a match of fists of bigger boys. Turn back the stinky finger my Samuel uses to pull snot from his nose at the table. And let my baby Anne wait until I've finished grace before she puts so much as a crumb of bread in her greedly little mouth. Amen. Amen. Ma? It's nothing. Ma? Ma! Dear God, make it stop. Ma! Ma. Come quick, my ma needs help. Go away! I'm not here. Please, Barber. To hell with 'Please, Barber'! What do I care about another wheezing whore in this dunghole of a shitheap!? Go home! Come back tomorrow if she ain't dead by then. Get out of my wagon! I cleanse this sinful heart with this sacred oil. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost... - Amen. - Hurry! Ma, I brought the Barber to heal you. What's he doing here? If you've got him... it's too late... for me. There is no cure for what ails this woman but the grace of God. Anything else would be called witchcraft. Amen, Father. You've taken the words out of me mouth. No, Barber. Please! Is there somehone here who disputes the authority of the Holy Church? Father... not me. Dear God and Lord Jesus, have mercy on us three children. Return our mother to us. We need her more than you. Please, Lord Jesus. Please, God. The utensils go to whoever takes the youngest. We can take the two youngest. They can sleep in the stable. If you can take two, why not three? The oldest is too grown up. We can't fill his hungry mouth. Don't cry, Samuel. Remember, she's always with us. Let's go. Come on! Come on! Rob! - Come on! Come on. - Rob! I've taken these for the penny owed for the sacred oil. Where shall I go? Pray to the almighty God for guidance. I could look after the horse. I know horses! My heart bleeds for you, Rat. Ho! Who's there? Show yourself! Before the three of us come up and rip you apart! How did you get here? You need a faster horse. Down! - Please! Just tonight. - No. Get your filthy rump out of here. - Please! - No! Could you have saved her, Barber? There's no cure for side sickness. Is your Ma still alive? No. Died pushing me out. Do you have a family? - No. - So, who do you talk to when you're alone? I don't. I sleep, right now. If you'd only shut your hole. I've seen everything the good Lord put on the earth for us to see. And some terrifying things no man was supposed to witness in his life. That's why I can stand here before you and say that. I'm going to tear off your hands and then I'm going to kill you! I was just dressing a wound. Nowhere have I had the pleasure of looking out upon a crowd with prettier girls. No one less blighted by filthy tunes... than here in beautiful Ethelweller. Oh, that looks broken. For a thru'ppence, I could fix it for you. Come see us at the marketplace. Nowhere are the girls prettier You said that already! Oh shut up! Hey! My juggler! I found him at the bottom of a well! Ho, ho! The show is for free! And the treatment is almost for free! Where the bloody hell were you? House visit. A spoonful of kidney ash every morning gets your kidney problems out of the way. For forgetfulness, tie the dried tongue of a hoopoe bird round your neck. - And here is a very special potion... - This is witchcraft! - I picked the herbs myself under a full moon. - You'll end up in hell! It will stop your wife from bringing more brats to the world. Whether they're yours or your neighbors. It's black magic! Oh shut up! Come and get healed! Can't the young barber do it? There's no young barber here... just the ignorant apprentice of an ancient master. If you don't like the looks of me, you shouldn't have fallen off your broomstick, hag. Who's next? - Good night, little boy. - Night. How was it? Ah, I'm in love. You should stick to whores, too. Much less stress... - than other men's wives and daughters. - ..wives and daughters. Oh, Rob. Need a hand, old man? Ach! Don't you dare! Jesus! Bollocks! Have you ever wondered what's inside? In here. Flesh, blood, bones... your soul if you have one. Down here. More flesh, more blood. So, does side sickness come from bad blood? I don't care if it comes from my ass! Can't cure it, can't charge for it! Have you never wondered what's inside? You've never looked? I can slice you up after breakfast. No, I mean like in dead people? Don't you ever talk about that again. Never. Do you know what the church does to necromancers? Burn them at the stake. So stop talking about the side sickness. It won't bring your mother back. Not another word. Never. Pliers! Open your mouth More light. Push down on him. Holy earth from the Mount of Olives. Stir it in your mead and swallow it in one gulp. Have you forgotten how to drink, lad? I'll remind you. Like that, boy. Like that. The farmer with the tooth... death is coming for him. Death is coming for all of us, boy. No! I felt it. You felt death? Yes. Death won't trouble him over a toothache. My apprentice thinks he's a soothsayer! Really? So when's my husband coming back from war? War? Not too soon, I hope. What's the harvest going to be like this year? Gemurmel? Lachen? That's them! You there! Murderers! You need to give us some answers! In the morning this poor soul went to work in the field. At noon he went to see you to cure his aching tooth. - By evening he breathed his last. - True Run away. - You bewitched this poor man with black magic. - Run away. You trespassed against the Lord and the church! You owe my sister a husband. It might be hard if she's as ugly as you are. Get him! I think you'll live another hundred years. I told you to run. I'll start on the roof tomorrow. Then what? They'll heal. Not before we starve. You should go. And leave you to the wolves? I could always beg for alms outside the church. Yeah, and in winter? I'll make a nice meal for the crows. At least then this miserable life of mine will be over. Then the world would miss a great barber. You're not listening, boy! I can't even hold a pair of tooth pliers! I could hold them for you. I've been watching you all these years. You've also been watching the clouds. It doesn't mean you can make it rain. And some terrifying things that no man was meant to witness in his life. I've seen ugly giants... I've seen greedy dwarfs. And just the other day, I had to fight a fire spitting dragon... with me own two hands. But, nowhere, nowhere have I had the pleasure of looking out upon a crowd of prettier girls... This will stop your wife from bringing more brats to the world. Lord have mercy on me. Who wants to be healed? Save me from soiling myself with fear. Come into the house of wonders. Come in. Put the lad on the table. - Bone saw. - Oh... Bone saw... yes. Whole toe has got to come off... Whole toe... or he'll lose his leg. Here, put this in your mouth, lad. Bite on it. Iron. Iron. Iron! Talking about the iron! Is it hot? How many times has your apprentence done this? Thousands! Shut up! Deep breath and then go on. Swift movements and you'll be done with it. Oh, look, the holy Mary! Wow. My first amputation. Mine too. So, what's this potion called? Tears of the Holy Virgin. I thought you bought that from a monk in Jerusalem. He stopped crying a while back. Keep stirring! It has bitten. Remember boy, the more painful the treatment, the more they respect the barber. Next! For the same pay the mercenary has to sell his soul. The farmer has to work himself to the bone. You thank the Lord for your profession... Every bloody day. Thank the Lord. You look very healthy to me. Rob! Rob, come here! Shut up! Rob! - I hereby christen Rob Cole a barber! - Well done! You're an apprentice no more! You serve no master but yourself! Reward this barber, Venus! Hey, hey, hey. I'm here, you blind, old sod! The moaning end is the top Oh, hold your yap! I have eyes like a hawk! Yes, a dead one. Your master should see the Jew. The Jew can heal the blind. - No one can heal the blind. - The Jew can. Yeah, he also raises the dead and makes the lame walk on water. I think you're talking about Jesus Christ, our Savior. But he ain't no bloody Jew. Here. Let me do it. I need to practice. These people mutilate their children. They cut off their cocks. They'll gouge my eyes out. So what? You can't be anymore blind. How is it done? My master keeps his secret to himself. I'm a barber, too. A barber? Excellent. My hair could do with a trim. So, I make no promises. Your operation is a difficult one. Thirty pennies in advance. Thirty pennies! It's highway robbery. Never! - Please. - Rob! Do your best. What's your name? Rob. What's yours? I'm Benyamin. He's Jesse. - Are you a Christian, Rob? - Yes. Is it true that you're not even circumcised? Our God does not want us to do so. Blessed are you, Lord, Sovereign of the universe, who brings forth bread from the earth. Once you've eaten the bread, you can talk. Why don't you take off his bandage? Me? A barber can unwind a bandage. Can he not? Rob. - Is it you? - Yeah, it's me. Don't open your eyes yet. Now, loosen the scabs. Can you see? Like a child. He needs to rest now. Oh, bloody Rat. Hey, put your fingers there... with your fingers... What you've done to my masters eyes... Where did you learn it? In a place called Isfahan. Isfahan. Is that beyond London? Is that beyond London? Is he serious? And then... What is it? The world. The world. Look. We are here. This is London. And here, here is Isfahan. The greatest physician the world has ever seen teaches there. Ibn Sina. There is no one on earth who can matchhim for knowledge and wisdom. - Ibn... - Ibn Sina Ibn Sina. Can he cure the side sickness? Ibn Sina can cure many illnesses. How long would it take me to get there? Over a year. First you will have to go to the south coast of England. Then you cross the channel. Then you walk through France, you take a sailboat along the coast of Africa. And then you arrive in Egypt and here... you will be killed. Why? From this point, the Muslim world begins. Arabia, Persia. The Christians have been banished from everywhere. Only we Jews are tolerated. My condolences... You worship the wrong God. I don't remember the world so beautiful. I take the men, you take the women. We share the earnings fair and square. You take one-third and I take two-thirds. No, two-fifths for you and three-fifths for me. Naw, that's too complicated. The Jew said, Ibn Sina can cure leprosy, consumption and typhoid. For how much? I don't know. But he's got this huge palace where he treats his patients and they stay there until they're well. How much is he charging? And he's got another palace called Madrassa, where he teaches his students. He's got two palaces? Yeah and I want to go there and study. A barber with two palaces! No! I want to become a hakim. The Saracens, they call their healers hakims. I don't care what they call them. That Jew has been feeding you a story. We should travel to the Orient. - We? - Yes! In the Orient?! Yes! We'll come back as great healers. Cure our patients much better. Here's your share. Rise and shine, Mr. Hakim! Rob? Rob! Rob! Bloody hell. What are you doing!? I don't want to treat warts all my life. I don't want to pull teeth and sell colored horse piss as a miracle tonic! I want to learn how to cure the cataract. I want to learn how to cure the side sickness and all the other diseases. You told me it couldn't be done, but now you can see again. There is so much that you know nothing about. It's huge. Yeah. That's Dover. Best place to get a boat. Now get off my wagon. What are you waiting for? Go and drown. Get eaten by sea creatures... what do I care? Here. Thank you. Piss off, rat! Piss off. Lord have mercy upon me. Bless me on my long and dangerous journey. Let not the waves engulf me or sea monsters devour me Let not bandits slit my throat or wolves eat me alive. Let me not starve or get lost in the dark woods and cold mountains And, please, Lord Jesus forgive me that I shall deny my faith and soil myself with sin to serve your creation and glory. The caravan to Isfahan leaves in four days. Before you go I'll bring you to my brother. He has nice Jewish robes, praying straps. He makes a good price. Shalom. Shalom. How long to Isfahan? Two months. Just two months? That's good enough, Jew. Make sure these are filled with water by sunrise. Stop reading and sleep. You're wasting oil! That girl is as obsessed with her book as an opium smoker is with his pipe. It must be good money to bring her to Persia. More than enough. Some wealthy man from down there is paying. Like this. Close to the heart. What is your name? Jesse. Son of? Benyamin. Well, I don't know how Jews pray in England, Jesse Ben Benyamin, but here we observe the rules. Yes? Yes. There, look. Seljuks. Who are they? Nomadic tribes from up north. Gruesome horse people. They trek across this land and leave a path full of blood everywhere. By Allah. They look like they are praying. What thieves leave riches things like this behind? The Seljuks believe Allah has chosen them to punish all sinners. They despise possessions and pleasure in equal measure. It's all right. We should take her with us. I don't have room on my camel and you don't even have one. I have room in my sedan. With all due respect, she's not your business. I'm making her my business. How is she? She's sleeping. Don't forget to make her drink. How come you know so much about fever? In England I was a barber. A barber. Englishman! Walk somewhere else... or do you find the desert too cramped for your liking? Jesse! Jesse! Come! The little girl. She's getting worse. She was shivering with cold before. Now she's on fire. We need to lower her temperature. Do you have any water? Here. And Alladin was startled by the lamp which began to hiss and smoke. A ghostly fog arose from it from which a a giant shape emerged with eyes the size of cart wheels. Who are you? Asked Alladin. I am a genie at your service. A booming voice... answered.' What happens next? The genie grants Alladin's wishes. Which makes him unbelieveably wealthy and this helps him win the hand of the Sultan's daughter. I wish I had a lamp like that. My favorite story is about Sinbad. The sailor. He meets cannibals and giants on his voyages. But he isn't scared of anything. All these stories are in this one book? Yeah, and many more. It's the most beautiful thing. I've ever seen. I can take care of her now. So what are you doing so far away from home, Mr. Barber? I'm going to study with the greatest healer in all the world. Where I come from all the boys they want to be rabbis or merchants. I just want to help people. I can see that. What takes you to Isfahan? A business deal. What kind of business deal? Englishman! Tie the camels together! Jesse! The others! We lost the others! I'll find them. Help me! Come on, help me! Get the rope. I can't hold it. Rebecca! Rebecca! Save your strength. They're all dead. Keep moving. Keep moving. Deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory. Forever and ever. Amen. Who are you? Look, the Shah! The Shah! This man wants to speak with you. Your supposed to chase the beggars away from the gate, not to drag them into my room. Please, sir, I'm no beggar. I've come to study with the great healer, Ibn Sina. I see. So, you have letters of recommendation from renowned scholars of science praising your intellectual qualities, heralding you as mankind's greatest hope? I haven't, no. Then I can only assume you are fabulously rich and wish to provide an additional wing to our library. No, I have only a pocket full of sand. Then why should I take you in here? The last thing we need is another poor, stinking Jew. Throw him out... - and give him a beating. - No, please. Please. No, please... I've... I've come from the other end of the world! You can't touch those. Why don't I feel any pain? Your wound was made numb. So it could be sewn together without pain. How? Poppy seed ointment. Poppy seed ointment... We've used it for centuries... What do they use in your land? Mead. Lots of mead. You seem more interested in medicine than my other patients. I've come to be a student of Ibn Sina. How do you know him? I've been told he's the greatest healer in the whole world. Well, he's not that great. He's quite ordinary really. Do you know him? A little better each day. Could you speak to him for me? You rest now. Jew. Jew! Wake up. Your class is about to start. You may have tricked the master into giving you a seat in his class but you haven't tricked me. I've been accepted. My eyes are patient. They shall live to see you fail and leave. By Allah, not another Jew! Better a studious Jew than a lazy, over-privileged Persian loudmouth. Be careful who you insult, Mirdin. My father donated thirty volumes to the library and I can arrange it so you have access to none of them! Karim. Mirdin. I do hope that your heated exchange is in the name of scientific progress. Yes, master. And how is the head of our new arrival from across the earth? Very much better. Thank you, sir. Oh, thank your youth! It works miracles no physician can match. No, I meant thank you for speaking to Ibn Sina on my behalf. That was far less trouble than you might imagine. Yesterday I discovered something. - Those of you who play a musical instrument... - This is Ibn Sina's physics class. To a patient, the music. And I wish us to incorporate this into our healing. In my last physics class, we discussed sound. I demonstrated harmony and resonance. And I discovered that certain sounds can resonate with organs of the human body... Won't your parents mind a stranger staying in their home? If they found out that I let a fellow student sleep on the street, they'd disown me. - This is Jacob and this is Sarah. - Hello. Jesse, would you do us the honor of saying grace? Yes. Of course. Let us thank the Lord for wheat and let us thank the Lord for the wheat, that... uh, he... has... born from the earth with his own two hands, so that we who eat bread, have a lot of bread to eat. This is how you say it in England? Hey, Come on! Keep moving! You shouldn't pity them too much. Why? What have they done? They're zealots. They believe our Shah is violating the laws of Allah. Tolerance towards other religions, his support for science and the arts... all deadly sins in the eyes of the Mullahs. Does that deserve such harsh treatment? Jesse, if these people come to power, the Madrassa will be closed and we Jews will be driven out of the city. We must be thankful to the Shah. Up in time for class, Karim?! What's wrong? Did you father realize there is more to studying than just buying books? One cannot be up in time for class if one never went to bed. Shame on you, Karim. A true Muslim avoids wine and bad company. A true Muslim avoids the advice of a fake student who only made it to janitor. Exists due to existence. Existence is not the consequence of existing! The former is the sine qua non of the latter. Englishman, do you understand a word of this? Not yet. Aristotle? We don't treat the diseases. We treat the people who suffer from diseases. Good day to you, sir. My name is Ibn Sina and these are my students. With your permission, we would like to treat you. What is your name? My name is Abolqasem. It is a great honor to place my well-being... Ibn Sina would like a report on ear infections. Do you have a book on the topic? - Up there. - Thank you. Which one is on ear infections? All of them. Gentlemen, this is lamp oil - while that is vinegar for purification. - Purification. To the back are blocks of ice for cooling patients with fever. So, Gentlemen. Ideas? Uh, maybe... - The ice? - Ice. Maybe some rest? He's in pain. That's how we do it... in England. Imagine, the spheres of the universe as a series of concentric circles moving within one another. The great Aristotle claimed that the friction created by this motion generates a sound which he termed, 'the music of the spheres'. And sometimes on a really quiet night, if you listen really hard, the sound is apparent to the human ear. Master, I hear it. Are the girls in England as pretty as this? Prettier. Prettier! - Hello. - Shalom. Are their bodies like cypresses? Is there hair like... like waterfalls? Some of them even have red hair. Red?! I do not believe you. All over? Yeah. Yeah. Praise be unto Allah for the plentitude of creation! I pray that some red-haired English virgins await me in paradise! Did you leave a girl behind to come here? Actually, I did. The most beautiful girl I ever met. Clever... Gentle... Clever. - You already said clever. - Yeah, and beautiful. You already said beautiful, too. I would have stolen this girl from you. I would have killed you first. Today we pray for our brothers who lie in chains deep down in the tyrant's dungeons. But what misdeed did they commit? Did they murder someone? - No. - No. Did they dishonor a woman? No. Their only crimewas to follow the laws of the Holy Koran, Allah. Allah, we kneel humbly in the dust before you and ask you, 'how long do you want us to bear this injustice?' No.. We call on the righteous and generous Bar Kappara. - Mirdin! - Honorable Bar Kappara! Please let me introduce my friend and fellow student, Jesse ben Benyamin, from England. From England! We're proud of every Jew who gets accepted to the Madrassa. And my future bride is from Spain! Allow me to introduce her. Rebecca? Come. You may greet them. Shalom. Shalom. Shalom. I hope you will each do me the honor of attending our wedding. Oh, you are too generous. Oh, we have much to celebrate. It is a miracle Rebecca survived her passage to Isfahan. Her caravan was swallowed by the most ferocious sandstorm. A brave guide saved me... and a little girl. Thank God. My friend! This way. This way. Now you know what the business deal is. May your marriage be blessed and happy. - And now before we take our leave... - Thank you. I want to thank you all for joining us here. You seem sad. I lost someone I cared for very much. Well, now you have found me. We must take what we can find in this life. So why don't we see what we can find... here. Now, listen to me. I never lie down for anyone for free. Please, be quiet. Does this hurt? What's her ailment? I haven't yet diagnosed it, Master. Master! If you are the master, tell this maniac to let me go. The night is nearly over and my purse is empty. Please moderate your tongue, my child. If this young man has brought you here it will be for a good reason. Your good reason is? She won't survive the night. She looks and sounds in perfect health to me. It's something I can't explain. I need to go! My beautiful rose... as a personal favor to me, grant my student here a moment more of your valuable time. Now, that's how to talk to a lady. Hey, people pay good money to take those off. Master, look! Wake the pharmacist. Fetch henbane. Run. Where is he going? To save your life. Like a premonition, is it? It's as if... time stands still for a moment. The fabric of reality is pulled aside like a veil for me to see through. And what is it you see? I see nothing. I just feel and know that death is coming. The first time was with my mother. She died of side sickness. - It's a curse. - It's a gift. You saved that girl's life tonight. One success for many failures. Well, this is the burden every physician must learn to bear. You can't look upon death as the enemy. Then, what? A friend? I've calculated the orbits... of all these stars and planets. Filled volumes with calculations. I barely scratched at the real secrets of creation. Doesn't it frustrate you that there is so much we don't know. No. It fills me with awe. How pale and tedious would this world be without mystery? Master, could you have cured my mother's side sickness? It's beyond our reach. Maybe in a hundred years. Maybe in a thousand. Hyah! Hyah! Ibn Sina! It appears that we're about to be summoned. Never approach more than five steps. Never look him in the eye. Should he address you, answer in short sentences and always end with one of his honorifics. Jesse... Uh... answer in short sentences and end in one of his honorifics. I sprained my wrist. If you'd come earlier you would have seen me deftly separate this Seljuk's head from his body. I'm so sorry I missed it. I'm sure the Seljuk deserved the dissection. He was sent with a message of a peace treaty. And this prompted his immediate decapitation. Of course. The Seljuks are constantly violating our borders. We need to whip these wild animals. Or they will slaughter us like a sick goat. Do you so long for war, O Perfect One? The Seljuks have nothing to lose but the beasts beneath their saddles. You have an entire civilization. Is that so? But which great artist ever glorified a peaceful king? War alone will bestow immortal glory upon my name. Don't you agree? I studied the healing arts, O Sublime One. I know nothing of the route to immortality. Did you hear that? He dares to speak openly in my presence. I pray my palace does not collapse from such audacity. Where are you from? He hails from England, O Sublime One. I've read of it. A barbaric island at the edge of the world, where half-naked pagans resisted Caesar's legions. My countrymen wear clothes now. - O Protector of the People. - O Protector of the People. Tell me? Have you seen strange countries on your journey east? More than I can count. Even a humble student has seen more of the world than the Shah. Send that stinking head back to the Seljuks. My son shall have a hero's burial. What message may I bring to my Lord the Shah from the Lord of the Seljuks? Do not trouble yourself. I'll send my own message. Get one of our brothers who is suffering from the Black Death. So, the needle pierces the middle of the eye pushing a dimmed lense in the back of the eyeball. This allows sunlight to reach the patient's eyes undiminished... Master, somebody died in the market. He had black boils all over. The falcon's beak can pierce a man's skull. Did you know that, Englishman? Please, Sublime One. We've heard about the pustulated corpse who expired within the city walls. We must evacuate the city immediately. The city has been spared the plague for over a century. Even my father only ever heard speak of it. The son may live to see it with his own eyes. The Imam and his Mullahs have been praying for God's vengeance to punish my extravagance. I cannot do them that favor. My Lord, hundreds of thousands of your subjects could die. My people are fruitful. They will survive. You have disturbed my falcon. This audience is over. The plague doesn't care if you're rich or poor. Common man or noblemen, sun of the state. If it's reached Isfahan, no wall, however thick, will stop it. Are you threatening me, Englishman? Not a threat, my Lord. A promise. Galen believes that the plague was due to a disproportion of the four humors. Hippocrates blamed it on the release of bad air from the ground during earthquakes, caused by a disease-bringing constellation of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Over there. The only thing the scholars agree on is that there is approximately twelve hours from contagion to eruption. Twelve hours, Gentlemen. Twelve hours. Listen! On His Majesty's orders, the Madrassa will be honored to accompany the Shah on his hunting trip. Please, express our regrets to the Shah, but we cannot join him. You refuse to obey? We are hakims, not hunters. I will convey your answer. I know. Each of us is thinking, 'why should I stay and risk my life fighting a pestilence that has no cure?' Well, we must each find our own answer. So, those who wish to leave... go now with my blessing. The rest will battle death by my side untilwe defeat it... or it defeats us. Since when do we have fleas here? Twelve hours are almost gone. Maybe the All-merciful spares us. Shouldn't you be out hunting with the Shah instead of risking your life here? Sure, to hear from Mirdin and you until the end of my days what a bad doctor and infamous coward I am? Is it so important what a bunch of Jews think of you? No. It's only important what my friends think of me. Help! Help! Lay her down. The woman says the Seljuk spit on her before he died. Lay her down. Master, the plague doesn't kill everyone. The boy will live. The woman, the two men... Stop. They're going to die. We will fight for each and every life. Do you hear me? Each and every one. Yes, Hakim. The soldiers are closing the gates! We're being locked in with the plague. Yes, you, you can go through. All of you! Get back, get back! Get back. Hold them back! Only members of the royal court are permitted to leave the city. But I am a member of the court. Go. Close the doors. Hold them back. Papa, Ima... please, don't worry. It will all be over in a few days. Watch out for yourselves. You too. Mirdin - hurry to your sponsor's house. Hasn't Bar Kappara left town? He has, yes. Jesse. The water cools down my fever. No? You'd make a good Hakim. So, this is your good Jew? I agree that's what it looks like. Would you have left her like that? No. Neither would any husband worth the name. Tie her down. She musn't scratch the boils. They must burst by themselves. Why can't we just cut them out? Their roots are too deep. According to which authority? Hippocrates himself. He compares them to the roots of a tree. Did he see them with his own eyes? Do you question Hippocrates? You told me to question all certainties, Hakim! Whatever their source. Deeper. What if humans are different to dogs? What if the the boils don't branch out inside of us? No. Hakim, we have more than enough corpses at our disposal. What you are proposing, Allah forbids. As does Yahweh, as does Jesus Christ. People are dying and we can only watch. How can that be the will of any God? A hundred and thirteen. Today's body count alone. If we extrapolate for the entire city there are probably more than a thousand deaths per day. We're bailing out an ocean with a thimble. But we are bailing, nevertheless. Sinbad the sailor has as a story to tell. The story of his life. For long seasons he kept open house. And his entertainments were the most magnificent of all. All that riches could buy seemed at his disposal. And he lavished the good things of his life upon his guests. Pages, slaves and attendants there were in great number. His garden was spacious and beautiful. - It's the fleas, Master! - What? The shrouds of the dead are crawling with them. I believe the plague might be carried by their bite. When the host dies the body cools and the fleas leave to find a new victim... So, every corpse is a threat. Great! Now we look like women! It's better than dying. He won't be satisfied until we're all dead. Well, you have all these virgins waiting for you. How many was it again? Some say ninety-nine. Some say twenty. - What about yours? - None. None? Then what's the point in dying? To walk with God. Master! Look. Gust flea. Commonly found in rats. Gentlemen! We mix a strong poison. Yes, sir! Yes, Hakim. Praised be Allah. A hundred and ten. Three less than yesterday. The rate of death is declining. You heard me! Get to work. Stop loafing! You look better. Don't the other patients complain that you're neglecting them? I treat every patient equally. So, do you also read to them for hours? If it helps. Will you grant me one more wish, Genie? Or are they all gone? It's so beautiful. You can even see the snow on the mountains. It helps you forget everything down there. What sin has Isfahan committed that God must punish it so? I'm just thankful He spared you. In my fever, I dreamt that we were man and wife. We had children. Four! And did we roam around in a barber's cart? No. No, we lived in a great city. Where you built a Madrassa. All by myself? I helped. Jesse. You have to see this. Bar Kappara! Bar Kappara, you're alive! Jesse, did you see that? There! Karim? Don't look at me like that. Where I'm going the rivers are made of wine, and the women... the women are more beautiful than in the Shah's harem. One might even have red hair. God gives us life... and God takes it back. Why does he always take more than he gives? I'm just looking for reasons not to go home. Jesse, I wish you a long and happy life. You deserve it. Blessed are you, Lord, sovereign of the universe who has sanctified us with his commandment... and saved us from the plague. Amen. Amen. Amen. To survival. If the world were just, I should bow to you. But it is not. Arise! Arise, heros of Isfahan! We have a celebration to attend. Would you like some wine? What a shame. Why so glum? You have saved us. You should be drunk on our gratitude. Failing that... on my wine. - Sun of the state. - Enjoy yourself, Englishman. My father believed feelings and emotions were beneath a true ruler. When I was a child, to drive them from my heart, he would take me to witness executions. I watched condemned men beg for their lives. I watched the swarms of flies feasting on twitching corpses. But then, over time, I became used to the sight, the smell... and the screams. In time I felt nothing. My father had succeeded in turning death into a subject for objective study. And now I am the Shah... ruler of all we see. A king of feeling nothing. What was the name of your heroic friend? Karim. I shall be your new friend, Jesse ben Benyamin. And perhaps one day I shall mourn your passing. When Aristotle claimed that the world had no beginning, he was not saying that there was no creator. No. He simply wished to obsolve the creator of the charge of ever having been idle. I must apologize, Jesse. - For what? - For not engaging you with Aristotle. When the plague came, we were as helpless as a beach is to the advance of the sea. The tide washed over us and dragged our people away and we could do nothing to stop it. You ask of medicine what only Allah can perform... or Yaweh. Do you never doubt your calling? Every morning and every evening. In between I work too hard to think about it. We just received new patients. I can offer you a broken hip, worms or a terminal case of acute side sickness. Good day, sir. My name is Jesse ben Benyamin and with your permission, I'd like to treat you today. Call me Quasim. Can I give you something for the pain, Quasim. Can I still talk to you then? No, the opium does dull the senses. Then I must gratefully decline your generous offer. I might fall off the ladder. Ladder? The ladder my soul must ascend to paradise. It is very narrow, it is easy to fall off. May I nevertheless examine you and ask you some questions? It will shorten the time before I... Jesse, you know I am dying, don't you, Jesse? Yes. I didn't want to frighten you. Would you do me a favor? When I am gone take my corpse to the tower and leave it for the birds. You don't want to be buried or cremated? We Zoroastrians give our bodies to the vultures. They cleanse our souls of earthly remains. What about resurrection? Muslims, Jews, Christians doubt the immortality of the soul and want to take their bones with them, just in case. So you care nothing for your body? Why should God worry about the husk when he can harvest the fruit inside? Jesse... Jesse... Thank you. I hope you found your paradise, my friend. Oh my Lord, have mercy on me. It's been a long time since we have lain together. It will have to wait a little while longer. Why? I have my impurity. My husband would defile himself. You still have it? I'm sorry. No matter. I will tell the servant to prepare a bed for you in another room. The lungs are a large circle in which the heart resides with the stomach in front. A tube runs from the throat to both the lungs and the stomach. So, gentlemen... - lungs - Lungs. - Heart. - Heart. - Stomach. - Stomach. - Tube. - Tube. For what sin did Allah strike us with the plague? Why did our women and children have to die? And I say unto you, it is the sins committed each and every day in the university whose godless philosophy corrupts our city! Allah wishes that we finally open our eyes and look the enemy in the face! He gives us the insight and the wisdom. His mercy allows us to recognize who is responsible for our misery! Allahu akbar! Allahu akbar! Allahu akbar! Allahu akbar! Allahu akbar! Mirdin, what's going on? Where have you been all night? Working in the library. The whole city is up in arms. The Mullahs have taken to the streets. You're on the wrong side, Davout. Maybe. One day a great Koran school will arise within the walls of this godless university and Allah willing I will be its dean. I bring you the word of God, father of all Seljuks. I give you his sword, keeper of the faith. The faithful of Isfahan need your help. You promise me a city in chaos yearning for a strong ruler. As a man dying of thirst yearns for water. Under the Shah the city of Isfahan is adrift in the desert. Decaying from vice and apostasy. But when the Seljuks have driven out both the Shah and his Jews we can tether Isfahan to our faith and rebuild it clean. And the Seljuks? Could conquer all of Persia. Isfahan is your first step. Expect my army in ten days. It will be my greatest honor. Jesse ben Benyamin. You are to come with us. He has attacked and killed countless people. All of the villages around here have been deserted for fear of it. Finally, my boredom ends. The blood is still wet. He's beautiful. You should capture him, my Lord. Take him back to your palace for company. Where he will grow old and fat in a gilded cage? No, he deserves a glorious death. I shan't deny him. My Lord, what are you doing? Do not worry, Englishman. We man-eating beasts have the greatest of respect for one another. Did Allah ever create a more lonely beast than you? Your eyes are still of this world, Jesse ben Benyamin. The other world is so much better. Only the road of excess can lead to the palace of wisdom. Oh, you're in pain. I should examine... Our Lord is the very blossom of health and if anything, illness fears him. Go ahead, quench your desire. They're very beautiful, Sire, but... But... The female body holds no attraction for you. Am I right? No, we should get back soon. Only the Shah may end an audience! Are you the Shah!? No. You bore me after only one day. Let's go. Go! Would you permit me to examine your wife in private? Of course. I'd like to congratulate your husband. But there is no reason to, is there? You know who to congratulate. Your husband will cast you out. I could not wish for more. Don't be naive. He will have to hand you over to the elders and they will pass judgment on you and we both know what that judgment will be. I want to go home. This is your only chance. You must lie with your husband tonight. I'm back, my old friend. Let's work. Rebecca? Rebecca?! Rebecca? I've always known you were a fraud. But never in my wildest dreams did I see you as a fraud and necromancer. Take him. Jesse. Rebecca! It's time for you to tell your secrets to your husband. You have no right to arrest me. The Shah will punish you for this. The Shah's time is over. Now there is only God. It cannot be god's will to kill an unborn. Is there no other solution? Can't I just cast her out? - The child is not yours! - It's innocent! It's an innocent child. What do you care about the Englishman's bastard! Mirdin! Rebecca has been found guilty of adultery! She'll be dead by tomorrow! You promised me you'd be a good Jew. You... you promised that you'd stay away from her! But you dishonored her, and now she is with child! What have you done, Jesse? May the witness Davout Hosein arise? These men have trespassed against Allah. They've desecrated and defiled a corpse, committing the sin of necromancy. What proof do you have for your accusation? They recorded their misdeeds. Drawings depicting the inside of a corpse! Which Hakim Ibn Sina and his Jewish student cut open expressly for this purpose. Where did you get these drawings? In Ibn Sina's house which I searched after his arrest. You liar! I made those drawings. You took them from me... Are you certain they are not the result of a deranged imagination or an opium hallucination? See for yourself. This is the face of the godless Madrassa! This is the face of the godless Jews who study there! - This is the face of their godless teacher! - No! I alone dissected that body. You could not have undertaken such activities without his permission. Whether or not Ibn Sina held the knife or the pen, Ibn Sina was involved. There can only be one verdict for such a heinous crime. The court sentences both of them to death. No! You're making a terrible mistake! This is the most enlightened man of our time! This is what becomes of letting Jews in our city! They poison the spirit! I am no Jew. I am no Jew! I am no Jew! I am no Jew! What did you say? I am no Jew! The Jewish community does not deserve your wrath. My name is not Jesse ben Benyamin. It's Rob Cole. I'm a Christian. Baptised in an English church in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. A fine performance. It's true. Shall we see? Looks like a Jew to me. Enough of this farce. Take them away. Forgive me. How can you expect me to forgive you, my greatest student, to whom God gave such talents and a unique gift? You owed it... to the science of healing to grow old and gray, Rob Cole. It was your duty to live long and heal many. But you were reckless and now you will die for it. What is it like? Inside? It's both beautiful and... and frightening. Go on. I saw the heart. Describe it. It has two chambers with an impassable wall in between. So how does the blood get from one side to the other. By way of the lungs, I think. So all our theories about human circulation would be wrong. Master! Nothing is as it is in the books! Nothing. Continue. Don't skip a single detail. It seemed to have become infected like a... like a toe or something. Only it was inside... and I believe that is what killed him. You sent for me. A trial detained me. I heard. First preacher, now judge. What's your next step? I serve Allah wherever he sends me. So much pride in such a humble servant. I should lay your head in front of your feet. But I do not grant you the fame of a martyr. Did you bring me here to tell me everything you don't want to do because of your fear? Set Ibn Sina free. Immediately. Rescinding Allah's judgment would be a blasphemy. It would require someone with greater courage than I possess. Someone with no fear of the wrath of God. Or the Seljuk army that arrives in front of the city walls as we speak to free us from tyranny. Clear the gates! Everyone inside! Seljuks! Seljuks! Thank you, master... for all that you've taught me. Thank you... Rob Cole for all that you have learned. Come with me. The Hakims have reached a consensus. I have side sickness... and shall not live to another sunrise. Only you... have seen the cause of this illness with your own eyes. You will cut me open and remove it. Impossible. You've done it before. On a dead man, sun of the state. If the sun of the state sets tonight, the army will surrender to the Seljuks and the Mullahs will wipe out everyone who stands in their way... especially the Jews. Or does a Christian care nothing for the fate of Jews? But you must help me first. No. Stop this! This woman is under the personal protection of the Shah! Release her immediately. Which one of you is Mirdin Askari? Right here. Mirdin, where's Rebecca? She's with my mother. You do your help. I cannot think of a reason to help a liar and a traitor like you. The Shah has side sickness. Then you don't need my help or anyone else's... because he's going to die. Master? We are going to cut the Shah open and remove the sickness. Are you mad? Yes! I think we've all gone a little mad. You're next. Send your men away now. Someone has to punish you if you fail. You wouldn't want to outlive your beloved Shah. Like that. I see. The Englishman. Tonight you are the Shah and I am your subject. We don't have much time. We will take our men and all our soldiers and place them on that ridge to go and wait... here. It is the sins of the Jews, who take every advantage while they shelter under the protection of that man who permits all other sins. Our friends the Seljuks, they need our help now as they try to break down the walls of our prison from the outside, we need to clean it with fire from the inside. May Hashem be with us in time of distress and danger. As our enemies rise against us... lend our congregation strength, Lord... and help your children to stand together as one. - Hashem Yahsu! - Hashem Yahsu! Now, we can throw stones at the right people. Master, hand me the scalpel. Hold the wound open. Can you see it? There is too much blood. How's the heart? Strong enough... Mirdin! Put him out. Wait! I think... Master, I need the scalpel. Hold it. Burn them like rats! Smoke them out! We should bandage him now. My Lord, if you stand any chance of surviving you must rest. The hour of my demise is already written. Thanks to you... the angel of death will not find me in bed like a simpering old man but on the battlefield, like a king. You gave me a gift, now I give one to you. Lead your people to the east gate. My guards will escort you. From there the path is clear to the mountains. What will you remember me as, Englishman? Friend or tyrant? Both. Hurry, the Mullahs are gone. The way out is safe now. This way. Come, we must move. Quickly! Quickly. This is everything, master. What shall we do now? To the east gate. Don't stop. Don't stop until the city is but a pinprick behind you. Go to the east gate! Perfect One? Let us write some lines in a poem. Let us conquer a place in a painting. - Where's Ibn Sina? - I saw him at the Madrassa. Ibn Sina? In my dreams... I had hoped that students would still study here in a thousand years... and.. Honor my memory. Such vanity deserves to go up in flames. Another ruler will build you a university. I am too old to scrape and bow. What have you done? Call it your final exam, Rob Cole. Because there is nothing to be afraid of. Death is merely a threshold we must all cross. Into the silence after the final heartbeat, and drifting away with our final exhalation into eternal peace. Correct my mistakes. Add your diagrams and show the world what we've learned in this place. Hakim Robert Cole. Master. Now do as I say for once... and leave. Can you take us home now? Where to? Wherever. Our home is with you now. I already miss him. No. No one is dead as long as we remember them. His spirit will live on but it is in your hands to keep it alive. How can I do that? Be a great phyisican. Those two eyes have seen everything the good Lord put on this earth for us to see. And some terrifying things no man was meant to witness in his life. But nowhere have I seen more beautiful girls than here in... in beautiful London. So roll up! Listen up and shut up! What's wrong? Nobody's sick in this dump anymore? All the sick are at the hospital. The what? The hospital... built by the phyisican from the Orient. What physician from the Orient? Physician Cole! Cole? Him, his wife and a bunch of Jews. They can cure anything. The rat! Here. Lead the way. Tell me about him. I went for a fever. You get a soft bed to lie in, hot meals and magic medicine. Someone's playing music. And then what? Physican Cole comes to see you every evening and if you ask, he juggles for you and tells you amazing stories! With lions and horses with big humps on their backs and falcons that can break a man's skull with it's beak. Now this wife of his... what is she like? Delicious. What do you know? What are you nine? Bloody cheek! I'm ten.
