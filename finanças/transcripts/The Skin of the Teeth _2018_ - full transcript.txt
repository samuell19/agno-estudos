Would you like some more wine? - Yeah. - All right. (elegant music) (gentle music) - I'm on the couch. (laughs) - (laughs) Apparently. Oh hey, hey, hey.

It was nice. - You live in the city. Uh, you work at a hedge fund. Blah, blah, and blah, that, that's boring. I mean, that's really boring. I wanna know the real you. Like who are you? What makes John tick? - So young. I don't know. Why don't you start? - All right. I wanna change the world. - From the reception desk? - Whoa, hold on, I don't do that anymore. 1, I told you that? T work in film now. - Okay. Okay, so, I guess, you know, 1 grew up in the middle of nowhere. Right? My parents were born there. Their parents were born there. Nobody ever left. Ever wanted to leave, ever thought of thinking of leaving in the first place, I think, I don't know. But I was different. But it still took me 20 years, really. And um, now I'm here and I see all this hot, great mess, and, and it makes you think differently. It's um, one thing to know something else is out there. It's another to see it. To feel it. - Mm-hm. - Damn, I don't know, man, I don't know. I know I sound really naive or idealistic or you know, whatever, but that's why-- - Whatever, that's beautiful. - Yeah? - Yeah. You're something, you know that? (Josef laughs) - Shut up, what about you? - Seriously. (Josef laughs) - What about me? - Yeah. - Ugh, I don't know. - Whoa, whoa, come on, I (laughs) I just sat here and told you my whole you know, shebang, the whole thing. You gotta give me something. - Uh, I guess, for me, it's about the little things. - What do you mean? - What do you mean what do I mean? I mean the little things, I mean like my stuff, my house. My friends, my family, having a me-shaped place in the world. - [Josef] That's it? - What do you mean that's it? Yeah. You're kind of a dick, Joe. - Oh whoa, I mean, in a cute way right? That's what matters. (laughs) - You know you actually remind me of a guy 1 used to party With back in the day. He was a lot of fun at three in the morning. (door rattling) - Um, what do you mean you used to party with him? - [John] You know. We went out sometimes. - Did you, um, did you guys do stuff together? - [John] Uh, yeah, we, uh, hooked up. - No, no, I mean, you know. Did you guys take stuff together? - Occasionally. (wine sloshing) I mean, you're young in the city, it seems like the obvious thing to do. - I mean, yeah, tell me more, I wanna... Like, what did you do? Like, what was the best experience? - Best part is um, forgetting everything. Everything heavy just falls away. And nothing is frightening. And everything is possible. Aside from that, you're not missing much. - (laughs) Wow. Wow, um, I think I left my phone upstairs. You mind if I check if it's-- - Sure, it's on the bed. - Thanks.

All right? - Yeah, I, I can do that, mm-hm. - There's no wrong answers here, Joe. Just need you to tell me to the best of your ability exactly what happened tonight. Do you think you can do that? - Okay. Um, I went on a date, all right? Uh, we got a little dinner. Got a little drunk. Then we started to dance. And then he went crazy! Uh, he started to, started to scream, bashing his head against the wall. 1 tried to help him, but I didn't know what to do! He kept doing it again and again, and then he wasn't moving anymore. 1 tried to call an ambulance, but I panicked. 1, I didn't know what to do! Uh, when the police showed up 1, I didn't open the door because I was scared that you might think I had something to do with it. - I see, okay. Um, you're doing great, Joe. Great job. Um, how much did you have to drink tonight? - Uh, a, a few glasses of wine. - Did you know that there were psychoactive drugs in the apartment? - What? (laughs) Nah, nah, no. Um, psychoactive? - It's all right if you did! It's all right if you did. I just need to know exactly what happened. -1, I didn't know that. - Good job, Joe. You're doing fine. - Am I under arrest? - No, not, not right now, no. - Can I have some water? - Not right now. I'm gonna ask you to do something for me, Josef. It's totally within your right to refuse to do this. But if you do, I'm gonna have to start treating you more like a suspect. - Okay. - T want to examine your clothing. T want to just see if everything lines up, if your story checks out. All right, do I have your consent to do that? - Okay. - That's all right? - Uh-huh. - All right. Excellent. - All right. - [Detective Locarno] Well? - Um, yeah, I'll get changed now. - There you go. No, no! You can keep those. Thank you, Josef. I just need some biographical information now on you. Uh, for the records. When I ask you a question I need you to answer out loud. - [Josef] Yeah. - Full sentences, please. - Yeah, uh, you can, uh, (laughs) ask me some questions. - Thank you, Josef. Not so difficult, right? Uh, state and spell your name for me. (door clicking) - Um, Josef. J-O-S-E-F. - - Yeah. - Why not P-H? - (laughs) I don't know. Uh, Josef King. L TN-G. I. - T'know how to spell King. Uh, what's your occupation? - Um, I work in film. - What do you do? - Uh, I'm an assistant manager slash associate producer. - What does that mean? - Oh, uh, well a manager's kind of like an agent and a producer-- - T know what managers and producers do. What I'm asking you is what does it mean to be an associate manager slash assistant producer? - Well, um, uh, well, um, T work at a boutique agency, and what we do-- - How big? - What? - How big's your agency? - Well, there's the owner. - [Detective Locarno] Okay. - And then there's me. - Two people, that's it? - [Josef] Yeah. - How much talent do you manage? Clients, Joe. How many clients you got? - Uh, (laughs) we're in discussion with a number of potential clients at this-- - How many? - Uh, at present, we currently have a single, primary client. - One client. So let me get this straight. You and one guy-- - Woman. A woman. - You work with one woman, who has one client. That's it. What do you do? - T identify possible projects and implement outreach strategies. - How much money you make? - Why does that matter? - You really want to be telling me what matters right now, Joe? All right, we'll let that one go. Uh, how old are you? -21 (Detective Matthews laughs) 25. - Hm. - (laughs) All right, 26! (laughs) Okay, okay. - Isn't your late 20s still, like a little old to be trying to make it in film? - I think 26 is still your mid-twenties? - Is that true? - How well did you know Jesse Burstner? - Who? - The deceased. So, not well. - Uh, he didn't, didn't, um-- - How did you know Jesse? - I, I-- - That's John to you. - I'mean, I knew him obviously, you know? But I didn't really know him. We were just starting to get to know each other, you know. - What was the nature of your relationship? - Uh, too soon to say. - Was it sexual? - Was what sexual? - Was the relationship with John, Jesse, was it sexual? - I think so? (laughs) - You don't know if you had a sexual relationship? - (laughs) Of course I do. I think. Yes we did have a sexual relationship. (laughs) I mean-- - Are you a, are you a top? Are you a top? - Idon't, I mean-- - It's a simple question, really. Do you fuck or do you get fucked? - Oh, I don't accept the dichotomy implied by your question. (laughs) - Josef. - Yeah. - I'need an answer to my question, Josef. - Are you allowed to ask that? - Sure, why not? - Privacy? - Joe. Privacy is for people in houses and offices. Privacy isn't for people like you. So I'll just, I'll ask you again. Um, you know. Uh, do you fuck or do you get fucked? - I guess I'm more of a bottom. - So your preferred sexual activity is just bend over and let another man fuck you in the ass. - Uh, (laughs) I don't think I'd put it that way. - How would you put it? - What? - How would you describe your preferred sexual activity? - Oh, um, I guess I would say that, hm, I like to dick-tate the terms? (Josef laughs) Right?! (Josef laughs) (Detective Matthews laughs fakely) That's great! That's great! Can I have some water? (laughs) Oh! (laughs) Oh, dick-tate. 'Can 1, can 1 please have some water? '? Oh man. - Uh, come with me. - Oh. - Her, not you. Get in. You asked for water?! (water splashing) Three times! (water splashing) Uh, so Josef. What time did you get to Jesse's apartment tonight? Why don't you sit down? You're gonna get tired just standing there. - T'want a lawyer. - Josef, think about what you're asking for, all right? Up to now, it's been two guys, just you and me talking, all right? As soon as you ask for a lawyer it becomes something totally different. Something serious. - I Want a lawyer. - It's your choice. - And uh, weren't you supposed to read me my rights or something? - We did, you don't remember? (knocking) - Hello? - [Amanda] Hello? This is Amanda Hastler. Do I have your permission to enter? - Um, I, I, I guess so? - [Amanda] This is Amanda Hastler. Do I have your permission to enter? - Yes, you have my permission! - Mr. King? (eerie music) Hello, Mr. King. I'm Amanda Hastler. I'm a public defender. I'm your lawyer. - Ow. Okay then. (strange music) Won't you have a seat? (perplexed music) The county has briefed me on the particulars of your case. It's all gonna be okay. - They tortured someone just because 1 asked for water. - That must have been very hard. - They can't do that. Well? - What? - Aren't you gonna tell somebody, or do something? - T'want you to focus on you, Josef. (shadowy music) This is the defense 1 have prepared for you. (questioning music) - Um, don't you want me to tell you what happened first? - No, absolutely not. Please, just read it, Mr. King. You'll find it's very good. (bizarre music) What's the matter with you? - Oh, uh, sorry. (Josef coughs) (mysterious music) - The county seems to think they have a strong case against you. - Oh, um, they're only confident because they're so stupid. (creepy music) - I'm gonna arrange for you to speak with the prosecutor tonight. We need to convince them that you're a good person. - Mm-hm. (shadowy music) - Have you made your phone call? - Uh, I don't think so. - Oh, do I not. You should call someone. - [Josef] Who? - I don't know. Your family, your employer. Isn't anyone gonna miss you tomorrow? - Not really. (perplexed music) - I'm gonna have them bring a phone. {ominous music) (knocking) (beeping) (phone ringing) - [Dispatcher] 911, what's your emergency? Hello? Hello? - I think they're sleeping. (knocking) - Hey. - Hello? (phone beeps) (phone ringing) - [Dispatcher] 911, what's your emergency? Hello? (dial tone droning) (phone beeps) (Detective Matthews laughs) - Joe, Joey, Josef. Are you surprised? - Not really. - Not even a little? - Aren't there people watching? - Silly Joey. We don't have the budget for that. You people turn me on so much. - Gays? (Detective Matthews laughs) (head thudding) - No. - Blacks? - Guess again. - Men? - Suspects. Watching you all scared and guilty and helpless quivering under the harsh light of the law. It gets me ah Every single time. (Detective Matthews groans) (Detective Matthews screeches) (Josef coughs) Josef. I could tell them anything and they would believe me over you. I could say you tried to escape, that you assaulted me. You wouldn't want that. Would you? (dramatic music) No! No, you don't know what's out there! (urgent music) Ma'am. - Who are you talking to? - Her. (scary music) Bow. (foreboding music) - Listen, we... Good evening, ma'am. (strange music) We need his lawyer present. (spooky music) Counselor. - Detective. (bizarre music) Your move. (suspenseful music) (Detective Locarno snorts) You don't have to answer that if you don't want to. (mysterious music) Sh! Careful. (strange music) (terrifying music) (head thuds) (birds chirping) (door bangs) - (laughs) I don't think you're supposed to smoke in here. - What are they gonna do, arrest me? (flame crackling) - What did you do? - Nothing. - Then why are you here? - That's a good question. They think that I killed someone. - Did you? - Potato, potahto. (Joshua and Josef laughing) - Can I have one? - Inhale. Look, just take this one. (flame crackling) Enough, enough! - That's it? (laughs) - Did you inhale? Did you breathe the smoke into your lungs or did you just hold it in your mouth? (flame crackling) Now exhale. (Josef coughs) (Josef laughs) - Never got it before. (door clicks) - Hello, Josef. How are you feeling? - Okay, I, uh... - We need a new strategy. Liesje Burstner wants to meet you. 1 think that's a good idea. - Who? - Jesse's sister. - Oh. - Her support could mean a lot. Josef? Is it all right with you? - Yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah. - Wait here a moment. (knocking) (door clicking) Try this on. Raise your arms. Roll it up. There. - You see a lot of cases like mine? - I see cases like yours all the time. Take a seat. Get up. Get up. - Good to meet you. - I was wrong. - What? What do you mean? - Idon't want to talk to him. - [Detective Locarno] Are you sure? - I don't want to talk about Jesse. - He told me his name was John. - Of course he did. I want to go now. - I'll take you to another room. We just have a few more questions. - No. - [Detective Locarno] Ma'am. - Oh I can't. I can't. I've been answering your questions all night. 1 was his sister. I want to hold on to the person that he was. With me. T want my grief. My sadness. If I tell you about him he becomes the person that you can understand. The facts that I can tell you, but he was much more than that. I want to hold on to the person that he was. T want to remember him for everything. Not just part of it. I knew more than anyone else, and with every little bit that fades, and he dies again. And again and again. 1 don't want to talk about him anymore. - I'm, I'm sorry. (knocking) Um, Detective Locarno? Um, I wanted to make a complaint about inappropriate treatment. Um, Detective Matthews really-- - Who? What? Who are you talking about? - Detective Matthews. - Idon't know what incident you're referring to but there is no Detective Matthews here. - She looks just like my lawyer and, but um, she didn't have any pants on. Um, those questions were inappropriate. Those question you asked me about my job and being gay and sex and what I like. It was, it was homophobic. - Kid, I've been a cop in the city for 23 years. I don't know what you were doing tonight but I was doing my job. If you think otherwise, call your lawyer. 1 like her, she's very good. Listen, it's been a long night. Let's just forget about this. - Well. That didn't go as well as I would have liked. Now what happens is the county decides whether or not to release you or charge you. Depending on the decision after that your options can be-- - Ms. Hayser. - Hastler. - Oh, sorry. Um, Ms. Hastler. 1 think I should tell you something. - Go ahead. - Um, my parents, my family are kind of kind of important. In the city. In politics. We're kind of a important family here. And you know my last name is King, right? - Mm-hm. - My parents are Kings. They are the Kings. I'm adopted. - You're a King. - Yeah. - You're the adopted son of David and Jessica King? - Yeah. - Are you shitting me? - No, no! No, they really are my parents. You can look it up and see everything. I mean there's, there's pictures and stuff, you know. - And you thought this might be helpful to mention? Why didn't you say something earlier? - Idon't like using it. They're just my parents. - I have to go tell them. There's no way the county will bring charges against a King. Not now. Give me a few minutes, I'll see what I can do. Would you mention my name to your father? If you feel like it's appropriate, of course. - Uh, yeah. Yeah, of course. - Great. (knocking) (banging) - You're free to go, Mr. King. - Where's, um, Ms. Hastler? I wanted to thank her. - She's busy. I'll let her know. - Okay. Hello? (perplexing music)
