[MUSIC PLAYING] [THUD] I found it. Here it is. Oh, good. Look, a car's coming. Maybe it's Uncle Joe. Let's go tell dad. OK. Dad. I think it's a Uncle Joe. Yeah. Lee, what is it? Susan, take the kids to your room and don't come out no matter what. Go. Honey, you stay with the kids too. And take the gun and use it if you have to. Don't be afraid. [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [NERVOUS BREATHING] Quiet. Very quiet. [DARK MUSIC PLAYING] You have a very beautiful daughter, Lee. Who are your friends, Dr. Stone? This is Mark and Paul. I hired them to find you. Three years ago, your brother stole $2 million from the mission. He was sentenced to 10 years. The others sit like fools waiting for him to get out so they can follow him and see where he hid it. But he's got seven years left, and I don't have to wait. You went into hiding. What does this tell us? [DARK NOTE PLAYS] It tells me he left the money with you. I knew someone would come here under that assumption. I did not know it would be you. It's nice to know who your enemies are. Let me tell you. I don't have the money and I know you don't have the money either. You have two choices, Lee. You can give me the money and I'll walk out of here and now, or you can keep your story, and I'll kill. [HARD NOTE PLAYS] LEE: If you kill me, what about the money? [HAMMER CLICKS] I'll wait for Joe to get out, like everybody else. I'm telling you do the truth. Joe brought the suitcase to me, thinking the money was in it, but it was filled with cut up newspaper. You got to believe me, please. Wait. [HARD NOTE PLAYS] [GLASS CLATTERS] [SWALLOWS AND EXHALES] This will be the last drink we share together, my friend. [BANG] [BANG] [GUNFIRE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] [BANG] [GUNFIRE] [CRYING] Momma! Momma! Momma! Momma! You-- you bastard! [HYSTERICAL BREATHING] [SCREAMING] No! No. No. No. No. No! No! No! No! [CRYING] No! No! No! No! No! No! No! [SCREAMING] [DISTANT SCREAMING] [GUNFIRE] Let's get the hell out of here. You bet, Paul. [CRUNCH] [MUSIC PLAYING] MARINGANO: There is something missing from our program, Luciani. It-- it just lacks appeal. We must find a way into the people's pockets. MARINGANO [TV]: [INAUDIBLE] suppress the-- [KNOCK ON DOOR] Come in. Yes? Director Maringano, Joseph Lee has been paroled. Yes? Oh, good. Perhaps he'll start a new life now. [GONG SOUND] [MUSIC PLAYING] [DISTANT CHATTER AND HORNS HONKING] OK. Hit me. - One more. - OK. You lose. - Dammit. [INAUDIBLE] OK. You lose. Dammit [INAUDIBLE] [QUIETLY] Scum. [CARDS BEING DEALT] [INAUDIBLE] Uh, one more. You lose. [INAUDIBLE] You lose. [THUD] Goddammit! You son of a bitch! You cheater [INAUDIBLE] my money. Hey, old man, if you don't like the way I'm playing, there's the door. Go fuck yourself! [BEADS RATTLING] This game's over. [INAUDIBLE] we can't quit now. Come on, man. She's got a visitor. Come on, guys. Let's take it outside. [BEADS RATTLING] What the hell are you doing here? Why don't you take your money and get out? I want a drink. [SIGHS] [BOTTLE AND GLASS THUD] Why did you come back, Joe? There's no place for you here. Lee isn't here anymore to take you in or to bail you out. He was a father to you. He gave you every chance to be everything you could be. He was the best of us. You know, before we left China, I begged him. I begged him to leave you behind. But no, he wanted to bring you to America. Oh, give him a new start, he said. Give him a chance. Give him a chance where nobody knows him. You got lucky, Joe. Maringano gave you that chance. Lee was so proud of you. Even I was proud of you, but it didn't take long, did it? It didn't take long for you to go back to your old ways in dishonoring the family just like you used to do so often in China. And I don't know how you did it. I can't imagine how, but you got Lee involved, and now he's dead. And the children-- the whole family-- gone because of you. [MUSIC PLAYING] They should have kept you locked up, Joe. They should have kept you in prison for the rest of your life. I didn't take the money, Sis. After all of this, how can you still lie to me, Joe? It was newspaper. You're serious, aren't you? What-- what are you saying? You mean you were framed? By who? Joe, take this money. Take it and go. Go to Mexico. Go to Hong Kong. Just get out. I can't. Someone will pay. No. Lee wouldn't want you to do that. No choice. [CAN CRUNCHES] [MUSIC PLAYING] Something's wrong. Turn off the light and hide. [ELECTRICAL CRACKLING] [CLATTER] THUG: Come on, let's get him. [MUSIC PLAYING] Howdy. Hi. Fill her up. OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, you're not from around here. What, uh-- what brings you to these parts? Paying a debt. [QUIET CHUCKLE] Honest guy, huh? You coming all the way out here to pay a debt? Uh, I am looking for Salina Park. You know where? - Yeah. I know where it is. It's, uh, just down past Angel Town, about three miles. It's by the old cemetery. Uh huh. Is, uh-- is that where you're going to pay your debt? Part of it. Uh, it's seven even. Seven even, huh? OK. Thank you. Now, you have a nice day. Mhm. [ENGINE STARTS] [SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE DINGING] Thank you, Percy. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah? Yeah, Paul. [QUIETLY] Will you slow down? Paul, just wait a minute, all right? So he's heading toward town. He could be just another tourist. All right, Paul. [SCOFFS] I'll take care of him, all right? Oh, watch out. Yeah. Paul, don't worry, buddy, all right? Salina Park. Who would be interested in Salina Park after 7 years? [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING AND HOOTING] Hey, gorgeous, how about some more beer? Yow, baby. Mm, mm, mm. You look good, you feel good. Howsabout you and me going someplace quiet? Hands off, sonny. Ohhh. [CHUCKLING] Maybe when you get a little older, I'll try [INAUDIBLE].. Ohhh. Hey, I'm older. Why don't you try me now? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, baby. Where you going? Come on back and join the party, huh? Not interesting. Oh, I'll make you an interested. [RIP] [MEN HOOTING] [SLAP] Bitch. Excuse me. Assholes! Disgusting, ain't he? But he's got money. What will it be? Jack Daniels. [LIGHTER CLICKS] [SLURRING] [INAUDIBLE] got to stick together. These are hard times. I need some information. What kind of information? How long have you lived here? That's easy. A long time. More than seven years? BARTENDER: More than seven. Good. Tell me about this. Bad killing. A massacre was what it was. The whole family. The girl was raped. I don't nothing about it. [CROWD CHEERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, wow. Look at this. [CHUCKLING] [TAP] Excuse me. [CHUCKLES] Come on. Eh? Come on.

[DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] Somebody here has been doing a little remodeling without a permit. I think you better come with me. [MUFFLED CHEERING] Well, somebody else has a hearing problem. [HAMMER CLICKS] Does that help? [MUFFLED CHEERING] You must be talking to me, eh? No shit, Sherlock. You're under arrest. Now spread them! [CRASH] OK? Don't you move. [CUFFS RATTLING] [CUFFS CLICKING] Don't you turn around, all right? Fuck you. [QUIETLY] Ohhh, you got a dirty mouth too. All right. You turn around and you walk straight forward, and you walk. Don't you turn around. [MUFFLED CHEERING] MAN: [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SCOFFS] What do you got there, sheriff? Another smart ass, Earl. I want him booked on charges of disturbing the peace, destruction of private property, assault and battery, and resisting arrest. He did all that? You know, I think I'll take care of him myself. Willy? WILLIE: Yes, sir? I want you to take him to the basement. Yes, sir. Come with me. And watch him, Willie. MAN: Hey, man. I ain't do nothing. [INAUDIBLE] Come on, man, let's go. Hey. What? What? - Let's get him up. I am not-- I want my boss. We got an outstanding warrant [INAUDIBLE] for this guy. I didn't do nothing, man. I want to [INAUDIBLE] a complaint. Take the cuffs off him, Percy. [CUFFS CLICKING] Empty your pockets. [CLATTER] Where did you steal that? You crazy? This is mine. [GASPS] Percy, take his belt and his bracelet. Well, I'm going to ask you one more time. Where did you get that money? And I want the truth. I told you already. That's it. Well, we'll just go ahead and do a little paperwork. [TYPEWRITER CLICKS] Name. What is your name? [QUIETLY] Big motherfucker, ain't it? Joseph Lee. [TYPEWRITER KEYS CLICKING] Address. Now, I live here. [QUIETLY] No, no, no, no. Where did you come from? I want the truth. Where did you come from? Rockville Penitentiary. [TYPEWRITER KEYS CLICKING] Rockville. Rockville. You're a con. Now, what would you be doing here? No reason. I have a right driving through, don't I? The only right you have is to go see the judge in the morning, and I guarantee you you're going to get 90 days in jail and a $500 fine. And we got a judge that just loves his job. OK. You got nothing on me. [THWACK] [GROANS] [INAUDIBLE] Get him back here. Go ahead, motherfucker. Give me a reason to blow your head off. Go ahead. [DOOR SLIDING CLOSED] WOMAN: None of your business. MAN: What do you mean, it's none of my business? I told him what your name is. WOMAN: You heard me. I said it's none of your business. MAN: [INAUDIBLE] [DOOR SLAMS] [INAUDIBLE] bad momma. WOMAN: That's right. MAN: So how much are you going for? WOMAN: That's right. It's 50 bucks. MAN: What? That's too much! How about $20? That's even too much for you That's right. Minimum pay is $3.50 an hour, and they don't even pay taxes, so $20 is too much. WOMAN: Hey, man, what do you know? Business is business. So take it or fucking leave it. Hey, don't get mad. I'll do you a favor. I'll introduce you to a rich chinaman. That's you. $50 OK? What the hell? No way, man. Going rate for chinks is 100 bucks. What? 100 bucks? That's a lot of wonton soup. [LAUGHS] You talk too much, hmm? Why, you son of a bitching chink. MAN: Yo, man, back off. [TIRES SQUEAK] Here's your lunch, sir. Sheriff? Hey, what did you do with the chinaman? [CHOKING] Get the hell out of here! [COUGHING] [PHONE RINGING] Yeah. Yeah, Paul, I know we got problems, but I've taken care of it. [MUFFLED CHATTER] MARK: Joseph Lee. Get your butt out of here. Hey, you. Hey, go to hell! I'll see you there. MARK: We got a peaceful town here, and I want to keep it that way. And I got a feeling that wherever you go, there is trouble. So I'm going to let you go, and you just be out of town by today. Because if I ever see you back here again, I'm going to throw you so far back in my jail that even the rats won't know where you're at. Complaint? My money. [CHUCKLES] That's right. I forgot to tell you. I said I'd let you go. I didn't say that you wouldn't have to pay for the damages at the bar. But I suggest that you consider yourself lucky with my generosity. Here, you just leave your name and number, and I'll be sure and get what's left to you. WOMAN: Looks like this hasn't been your day. JOE: Well, it could have been better. Look, I'm sorry about your van, but the boys aren't good losers. What you've been doing around here, people don't take too kindly to that. What's it to you, hmm? Maybe I just respect a good fighter. Look, why don't you just take my advice and leave town now while you can still walk out? What's your name? Oggie. What's yours? Joe. [TIRES SQUEAL] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [WIND BLOWING] MAN: Where did he come from? [FLASHBACK SOUND] MARINGANO: Well, he wandered the mission three days ago. That's all we know. [INAUDIBLE] He's trying to say something. 2 million. $2 million. My house in the wall. My house. $2 million. You've got to-- to find it. [GASPING BREATH] [DARK MUSIC PLAYING] He's dead. Well, Joe, I guess you heard it all too then. That means we have four witnesses. [MATCH STRIKES] [RIP] DR. STONE: My god. MAN: Oh my god. DR. STONE: My god, we're all rich. [LAUGHS] MARINGANO: Joe. Joe, put all the money in the bag. Wait, there's a letter. DR. STONE: I'll take that. Whoever finds this money, please take this money to Center for Less Fortunate in New York so that it may be used for the good of everyone. [DARK MUSIC PLAYING] Only the four of us know about this letter, right? [RIP] And now there wasn't any letter. - No, no. We can't do that. We must do as the letter says. The reason I chose you, Joe, is because of the importance of this task, which does involve some danger. And to give you a chance to prove you're truly trying to lead a clean and honest life now. Don't worry, director. I'll take care of this. I'm going to ask you one more time, for the last time. You really going to send this money back? We can not be greedy. We must do this. There's a driver waiting for you outside. The driver will help you. My brother, please take it. I want you to have a good life. You have betrayed me and Mr. Maringano. How can you bring stolen money to me? This money came from my heart. Please take it. Maringano and I helped you to be with good, decent life. And now you do this. I know your heart is with us. I know your meaning is for good, but what you do is wrong. It's wrong. I want you to take this back. JUDGE: I sentence you to 10 years in the state penitentiary.

Let that guy go so we could get him out of town. I guess our troubles are finally over, huh? You got it, Pauly. And that calls for a celebration. Yeah. Buy me a drink? Well, You bet, sweetheart. We'll buy you anything you want. You can even come to our party. OK. I like celebrations. Don't you touch that. It was my granddaddy's, wasn't it? Yeah? I didn't know you were from a musical family. [QUIETLY] Well, now you know. [LAUGHTER] Mark, what happened to that chinaman? Oh, we ran his ass way out of town. You must have had your hands full trying to get him out of town. He wasn't too much for us, was he, Mark? Yeah. He ran like a scared rabbit, but we outsmarted him. He won't be coming back neither. [CHUCKLES] All he ever tried to do was protect himself. Protect himself? He busts up a bar, he beats up five innocent people, and breaks up my jail, and he's protecting himself? What are you, having an orgasm over the little fucker, or are you just stupid? Yeah. What are you, a stupid bitch? Yeah. You're right. What do I know? Yeah. What do you know? [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] OGGIE: Goodnight, Paul. PAUL: Goodnight. OGGIE: Goodnight, sheriff. MARK: Goodnight, Oggie. [CHUCKLES] OGGIE: Hey, [INAUDIBLE] aren't you? Maybe. Come on, Paul. I hope to hell you quit acting like a damned old-- PAUL: What are you talking about? MARK: Dammit, Paul, he's still alive. PAUL: Son of a bitch. Get him in the back of the truck! Why aren't you dead? Damn rice eater. I'm going to get rid of you once and for all. You've had your last bowl of wonton soup. Now what are we going to do with him? We're going to get rid of him. Take him to-- we'll take him to Royal Canyon and throw him over the highest cliff we can find, that's what. Yeah. That's a good idea. [ENGINE STARTS] PAUL: You don't think you could live through that, do you? MARK: I don't know, Paul. He did, didn't he? PAUL: I ain't my fault. I know it's not your fault. It's not my fault either. Still got to kill the bastard. You know what's really [INAUDIBLE],, Paul? I mean, ohhh-- - Hey, wait a second. There's somebody following us back there. Oooh, maybe it's the cops, Paul. Why would the cops be following us? It was a joke, dammit. I am the cops, see? Yeah. I know that. MARK: Jesus. PAUL: Well, they're not back there now. They must have turned off or something. MARK: Well, that's a big relief, Paul. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [DOOR SHUTS] Woo! Jesus, it's cold out here tonight. Will you shut up? God, why did you parked so close to the edge for? You afraid, Paul? You afraid? No. Come on. I'll give you my hand. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, I'll give you a hand. Look! - [INAUDIBLE] - Take a look! Huh? [INAUDIBLE] Cut it out. All right. What if somebody sees us out here? Who is going to see us out here, Paul? I don't know. Will you just shut up and quit your worrying? We got everything under control, all right? All right? Come on. - OK. Well, let's get this over with. Rise and shine, bud. Come on. Damn. He is going to be in so many fucking pieces on the bottom, they'll never find him. You sure? Well, what if somebody does find him? Who is going to find him, Paul? I don't know. When you think, you worry so damn much! Get out of here. I'm going to do it myself. So long, pal. You're going to another world. [GRUNTS] Damn. I don't see nothing. Of course you don't see nothing. Get back in the car. - Yeah. Let's get out of here. Come on! [QUIETLY CHUCKLES] [RAGGED BREATHING] [ENGINE STARTS] [TRUCK DRIVES OFF] [GROANING] MARK: Nothing's ever simple, is it? I mean, you ought to be able to kill somebody and have them stay that way. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR CLOSES] Joe! Joe, where are you? Joe, listen, I'm going to get a rope. Just hang on. I'll be right back. I'm glad that's over. Maybe now you'll stop treating me like I'm your dog. What do you want me to say, I'm sorry? No. I don't want you to say your sorries. Forget it. I will. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right. Here it comes. Tie it around your waist, Joe. Then I'll pull you up. Don't you give up on me, Joe. [GRUNTS] [EXHALES] [GRUNTS] [ENGINE STARTS] [GRUNTS] Here [INAUDIBLE]. I'm so cold. It's OK, Joe. I'll get you feeling as good as new. [RAGGED BREATHING] [INAUDIBLE] What's it to you? Listen, Joe, you showed me something I haven't seen in a long time. And I'm not going to let go. Come on.

Paul's towing away Joe's van. What's going on? - Nothing. It's nothing. Jonathon. Thanks. [TOOL CLATTERS] [DOOR CLOSES] [SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE] What can I do for you? We came to see the sheriff. Earl? EARL: [INAUDIBLE] Take care of these man. Right this way, gentlemen. [RADIO CHATTER] Sheriff, there's a gentleman here to see you. Go ahead and send him in. I've been referred to you by a mutual friend of ours. Well, let's talk. You come highly recommended as a man who can take care of a situation, if the price is right. If the price is right. We're looking for a man, a slant-eyed chink, an ex-con. We heard that you had him in your jail. Now I want him. [ENVELOPE DROPPED] Deal? You got a deal. I can take you right to him. Joseph Lee is dead. [SNICKERING] I killed him. No small town hick pig is going to kill Joseph Lee. What about the money? He's jerking your chain. [SNICKERS] Oh, yeah? Joe ain't no easy guy to kill. Well, I'll take you right to him. And you bring your doggy bag, and we'll go clean up the pieces. Show me. I wonder how he did it. Shit. Shit. Looks like you made a mistake, Mr. Mark. Where in the hell is he? I told you, you fucking dickhead. You've been had. Have you found it yet? MARK: [INAUDIBLE] Dammit. That's what I thought. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] Anybody been around? No. It's all right. There's no one around. [LIGHTER CLICKS] Joe, why does that moron sheriff want you dead? Maybe he doesn't like pancake nose. OGGIE: Yeah. You're probably right on that point. But somehow, I think it goes a bit deeper than that. Which way [INAUDIBLE] town? It's about 5 miles west of here. Here, I brought you some medicine. [CLATTER] You're a lucky man, Joe. [SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING] How did you know this place? [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] My husband used to work here. I used to bring him lunch every day. You know, watch him, keep him company. But he just got tired of everything. You know, same old faces, same politics, same old bullshit. And then one day, he just didn't come home. Can't blame him, really. He only made one mistake. He didn't take me with him. He may be dead now, for all I know. I never even got a letter. I'm sorry. [HORN HONKING] [TIRES SQUEALING] Well, that son of a bitch is still alive. If he comes in here, you shoot his ass. And if we don't get him, we all go down, got it? [TIRES SQUEALING] Son of a bitch. JOE: Why [INAUDIBLE] to kill me? Maybe if you could find the reason, you could stop them. I don't know why. Do you have someone special? [SLAM] Oggie, get [INAUDIBLE]. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm sorry. It's OK. It was a good move. [STATIC] MAN [RADIO]: Sheriff, get over to the warehouse right now. Your chink's over there with Oggie.

[LAUGHTER] - Where's Oggie? - I don't know. What's the matter? - [INAUDIBLE] I don't know. She's late for work! What's wrong with Mark? Mr. Luciani wants to know what's wrong with Mark. What's wrong with Mark? Looks like the pig is pissed. He's pissed. THUG: Seahawk says he's pissed. LUCIANI: Why is he mad? THUG: [INAUDIBLE] this [INAUDIBLE]?? Why is he pissed? I don't know. [CHUCKLES] He don't know. THUG: They don't know. Looks like he ran after Joe again. [LAUGHTER] What the hell happened to you? [QUIETLY LAUGHS] I had him, and I lost him. And Oggie is helping his ass. OGGIE: Hello, everybody. [SLAP] [SLAP] Where is he? Where is he! Glad to see you too. You're hiding him somewhere. And I want to know where he is or I'm going to carve your face. I don't know where he is, and I wouldn't tell you if I did. [QUIETLY] Really? Is Oggie in love? [SPITS] No more games. [DOOR CREAKS] MARK: So Oggie is in love, huh? Oggie's in love. Well, you bitch. Now, hey, aren't you the sheriff? Why don't you arrest these people? [LAUGHTER] JOE: Almost ready? Yeah. It'll be ready in just a few-- [CLATTERING] JOE: Don't move. It's in good hands. [GUN COCKS] PAUL: What do you want from me? JOE: Get it on the hoist. Tie it to that bar. Tie it tight. Now, tie the end around your neck. [MACHINE HISSES] You don't want to die. Now, talk. I only did what they told me to. But I didn't kill your brother. It was Mark. Mark killed him. Now, please let me down. Why did Mark kill my family? Some guy named Stone hired us to find Lee. Lee was supposed to have a bunch of money, but he wouldn't turn it over and Mark killed him. It was Mark's idea to take the job from the beginning. I was just going along with him. It was Mark who killed your brother. I was just there. There was nothing I could do about what happened. I wouldn't have even been there, but I wanted to buy this garage, and I needed the money. Please, I've told you everything I know. Now, let me go. [GRUNTING] Talk, bitch. Talk. - No. God [INAUDIBLE] no. No! No! No! No! [SPUTTERING] No! No! LUCIANI: I want to hear you talk. No!

[MACHINE HISSING] [PAUL CHOKING] [BELL TOLLS] LUCIANI: Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. For thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPITS] [LITERAL BIBLE THUMP] Nice funeral. I've been expecting you. I have something you want and you have something I want. JOE: I know what I want. What do you want? The money. I know you're not a selfish man. Neither am I. We can split the money and go anywhere. Is it a deal? I'll meet you at old town wrecking yard. Bring Oggie in good condition. I'll be there. By the way, how is Maringano? He's fine. He would like to see you again. I'll see you soon. Come unarmed. You're a dead man for killing Paul! I don't think you'd use that gun? [INAUDIBLE] doesn't want me to die, stupid. [DARK MUSIC PLAYING] Turn Oggie loose. [CLATTER] I told you, come unarmed. [SHOTGUN COCKS] THUG: Mr. Luciano, I think he means to kill you. LUCIANI: What is this? Shall I call you Fearless Joe or Foolish Joe? Hell, you can have the hooker. I want the money. I don't have the money. That means you didn't bring it with you? That means I never had it. Liar! [DRAMATIC NOTE PLAYS] You have to die. [BANG] Hiyah! [CLANK] [THUMP] [THUMP] [THUMP] [THUD] [GROANS] [THUD] Get out. [DOOR SLAMS] [COUGHING] Damn! Thought you could fight!
