Why can't I wake up? Mom? Mama? Mom! Well, hey, there, sleepyhead. You dream something good? Didn't feel like a dream. What do you mean? I woke up from something, but... You know, I've always wondered if our dreams go on after we wake up. Like parallel lives we live when we sleep. You okay, Charlotte? Oh, no. Oh, no! Aaah! Fuckin' moron. After all these years. Got old real quick. I said don't get my hair wet! Oh, my God. I'm so sorry to get your hair wet in the lake. I just can't believe it's all over. Yeah, I know. I guess it's the big things you never see coming, huh? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I saw the truck, too. Yeah. It looked just like Joe's. Yeah, but it can't be, though, right? I mean, you think he even still lives here? Have you heard anything about him? You'd know if I did. I don't know. Sometimes I wonder. I know how much you still worry about him. Which is why I still worry about you. Olivia! What? What are you doing? Leave me alone! Last first day of summer. It's been a while since I've been swimming in the dark. Who knows what nasty things are in there? There's rocks! - My butt... - Whoo-hoo-hoo! Will! - You fucking dick! - Charlotte, run your shit. I'm not wearing a bathing suit. Will, stop. Are you gonna go swimming or not? - Will, stop. - You're an asshole. Charlotte! Oh, Will... - Shh. - Shh, shh, shh. Fucking asshole, Will. You could've hurt me. See? What was that? What is that, a fucking fox? That must be one hell of a fox. You see that? You see that? That's how you treat a young lady. I'm telling you, brother, they're beautiful. - What's going on? - What's up, Tay? Where you coming from, man? Is that Brady? - Joe's Brady? - Yes. What was her name again? Daphne Bell. Been a long time, kid. Hasn't been that long. It has for me. I'm glad you're still coming to Robby's. Fuckin' kidding me? I basically live here. Yeah, I know. I'm fucking with you. I figured it was gonna be a shit show. Heard you're up to some big shit, though. Who'd have figured you for a city girl? What about the rest of them? What they got going on? I don't know. UGA, Auburn. Will's going to SCAD. Clemson. Daphne, she's, uh, starting classes in the summer. - Really? - Mm-hmm. That's great. Oh, fuckin', uh... clipped a deer on the way here on 20. Exploded all over my windshield and shit. Are y'all okay? Yeah, we're... we're... we're good. Was a mess, though, man. Daphne nearly had a heart attack. She was pregnant. Yeah. It was fucked up. I'm glad y'all are okay. You see Joe anymore? No. No, not for a while. I was actually gonna ask y'all about him. Oh, no. Don't ask me. I'm... I'm the last one you ask. Guy's a fucking ghost. Nice one. I'll see y'all later. Okay. Bye, Will. You are on the way home. I can take you quicker than them. Sure. Kind of feels like a dream, don't it? What does? The last day of high school. Look, man. I'm sorry about the fireworks. You know, I didn't know you weren't wearing a bathing suit. I'm j... I'm just like... I'm like a shitty dog, man. Well, ain't you quiet. Sounded like a woman earlier. Man, I feel like this is gonna be the song of the summer. What are you doing home? Holy shit. - Look at you. - Stop. My high school graduate. Aren't you dressed a little early? Yeah, I'm going to meet the girls at Olivia's first. Is that new? No. Mom actually got it for me last spring. Just haven't found a reason to wear it till now. Well, I'm sure she would've loved to see you in it. Well... Mama... ...I wanted to come back here for so long... ...but I was afraid to... ...knowing that I wouldn't hear your singing downstairs... ...or feel your presence in the other room... ...but somehow I still do. So, I just want to know... ...are you here with me? Madison, I'm gonna miss you so much, but I wish you all the success and the happiness the world has to offer you because, out of anyone, I know you absolutely deserve it the most. And with that, it's my great pleasure to... It's a brave new world out there, and if anyone can make the best of it and start all over again, we can. Congrats! We made it! Hey. Did you find your dad? No. Well, that's not right. Where do you think he'd be? I have no idea. Well... Well, what are you gonna do? I'm just gonna catch up with y'all later. Charlotte! Let's fucking rave! Dad? You've reached Chief Rex Williams, Ajero Police Department. Leave your name and number, and I'll... Hello? Hey. Joe? You want to go for a ride? You're back from the dead. I wouldn't say that. I like your dress. I was gonna wear it to prom. Oh, yeah? Why didn't you? I didn't go. What's different about you? You know, I thought about cutting it all off, but then I remembered... I feel like I don't even recognize you. It's still me. It's hard to believe. You hurt yourself? - No, it's just a scrape. - How'd you manage that? Swimming. Slipped on the dock. You was out in Monroeville? So what? You didn't hear what happened over there? Really? Okay. Well, nah, I mean, if you was there... I must be crazy. Don't say that. Why did you call me tonight, Joe? You remember last summer when we heard those booms in the middle of the night? Remember no one knew what we were talking about 'cause we must have been the only ones awake for miles? That was the most painful week of my life, Joe. Do you ever hear 'em anymore? I don't really want to talk about that time. I do. I heard them last night. That, uh... that giant. Nothing's changed, has it? Then why the fuck did you answer? I could never say no to this. I wish you could. Where are we going? Why don't we find out? I'm sorry. I know I let you down, but... I need you to know that... I'm really tired, and I think I'm just gonna go to bed... A girl was killed tonight. A girl your age. In Monroeville? There's been another. Here. In town. A girl named Daphne Bell. Did you know her? Charlotte. I know some people who did. Nah, don't get quiet on me now, Charlotte. You know, there's something about the summer that just... takes me back... ...that brings the past back to life. It's all this sweat. All this... humidity. All the heat of those endless nights when I felt myself melt into you... ...and you into me. But something tore us apart. And I remember you lying awake next to me in the middle of the night... ...and how you'd get in your car and just drive all day... with no destination. But it's like your mama said... last summer... just before she died. Can't run from where we've been... ...and everything we've felt... ...we'll feel again, Charlotte. All this heat. All this sweat. All this pain. Until we melt together again. Olivia, the boys are calling for you! Hey, Ms. Calhoun, can I give you a hand with anything? Uh, no. But I appreciate your asking, darling. I don't even know why I bother to do this. Nobody's going to be eating this anyway. Who's that? That's that girl from Monroeville. Ava Harris. Charlie, you ready? Are y'all gonna have dinner here? - What's that behind your back? - Nothing. - We're gonna eat at the festival. - I saw that! Olivia! - About fucking time! Jesus! - Hey! Y'all coming back to eat or what? You know how in "Nightmare Before Christmas"... ...there's that forest of holidays... where every single day is the same holiday? Mine would totally be Fourth of July. And I don't care that we're clearly too old for this shit or that everyone else stopped coming after freshman year. Where else could I rather be? That is not my fault. I asked. It's here. It's here, man. It's not here yet. You are really taking it in spirit right now, aren't you? You think we heard her? Heard who? Ava Harris. - At the lake. - What? Is that what your dad told you? My dad doesn't tell me anything. I just can't stop thinking about it... that we might have been there. I mean, we saw Daphne on her last night on Earth, and it just... I feel like there's something there. You don't know that that's got anything to do with Daphne. But what if it does? What if something was happening? Can you promise me something, Charlotte? Because... I know this time of year is tough on you. It's not that. And we've only got six weeks left together now, - and they're gonna go by like... - like that. So whatever's going on... Olivia. ...and whatever's going on with you... promise me that we will stick together, no matter what. Promise me. I promise. Remember, that's a promise. Dude, I haven't had a fuckin' Bud Light since seven... Since when? I had one in the car. 7:00. I haven't had a fucking beer in hours. How you doing? You come here to see me? Just going down memory lane. Might've hoped you'd be going that same way. Not exactly. We tried that one. Yeah, I'm sorry about what happened. It's, uh... I have good days, and I have bad days. What do you want? I want to try again... tonight. That's all I want. You know, I'm leaving, too. Yeah, me and my folks, we're moving away at the end of the... I already thought you were gone, Joe. Don't you remember how it used to be? Ah, she's wearing a bathing suit at last, I see. Yeah, I learned my lesson. Where are your dumb fireworks this time? Oh, I'm gonna bring us fireworks, alright. What, are you trying to be cute or something? Is it working? Better luck next time. Hey, it ain't sporting if the whiskey does all the work. Oh, as if. You know, I overheard you talking to Olivia earlier. This whole situation is crazy, man. You know, I can feel the town changing. Yeah, it's like you can feel it in the air. I'm just saying. If you ever get scared and you need someone to talk to... Oh, boy. Now you're really trying to be cute. I mean, the killer... The killer could be out there, in the woods, at this very moment... just watching us... ...waiting for the right moment. Well, anyway, I'm getting in. Hey, wait, wait, wait. Are you just gonna leave me all alone at a time like this? - You ain't even my type, anyway. - Oh, yeah? What's your type? Well, you know, pretty, blonde, moody types. - Is this what you wanted? - Oh! - Come here, boy. - What's up, brother? - Come here, boy. - What's up?! Oh, okay! Okay! Wait. - I'm sorry. - No. I am. I'm really sorry. I don't know why... Don't. Brady, what are you doing here? How did you even know we were here? I don't know where to go anymore. Just got in my car, and... somehow I'm here. I didn't mean to crash y'all. I'm just alone in the fucking dark. So I drive, and I drive because that's the last thing she was doing. She was just driving, but I want to know where. Where... Where was she going? I see her in you. And I want her back so bad. I know. I know, Brady. I'm sorry. You don't feel it, too? In the hairs on your neck... underneath your skin... that this is only the beginning. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, you do. You think all this dancing and singing and laughing, you think... you think you can hide in all this. But this is where he finds you. I wish I could help you, Brady. I wish I could help you, too. But you're just his type. Can we just drive? You got somewhere in mind? I don't want this to be like last time. I just needed to get away. What from? I don't know. Sometimes, I still need you. I just hate feeling like I have to run from you. Where would you even run to? To when I didn't feel this way. We can go back down that road, Charlotte. But we both know where it goes. How did we even get here? Do you think we could get back? If we tried? Would you want to? More than anything. You know, every time I smell fireworks, I think of you. I think of that 4th of July when you were in eighth grade, and we snuck into the fair. I remember that night. When I first kissed you in this very place... ...all those years ago. Why did you take me here, Joe? You ever get that feeling... ...where you can't tell if you remember something... or if it was a dream? More than you know. That's how I feel about you now. Where have you been, Joe? I've been here... waiting for you. Thanks, Joe. Good night. Okay. Uh, I need you to know that I drove past this house every night for the better part of a year, and it was everything I could do not to knock on this door, to stand in front of you and look in your eyes again. But after Daphne... You know, we can't pass up the chance to say the things we need to. What would you have said to her? Uh, not to her. To you. I'm sorry for everything I did to you. I never wanted you to have to go through all this alone. Why didn't you call me that night, Joe? I just needed to stand in your light again. Is this goodbye, then? It doesn't have to be. Okay. Oh, fuck it. We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. Joe? Joe? Joe? So, is this where you've been? Did you follow me here? Charlotte, I haven't seen you since the 4th. You don't answer my calls. Since the 4th. So what? It's been a week, Charlotte. I think something terrible's happened. Is he inside? Charlotte. I asked you a question. I came to you to help me find him. - Not to interrog... - We are way past that. We crossed that line last summer. Everybody says that. I was the one who lived through it. He needs help. He needs me. And what if you're wrong? The one time I reach out to you, why did I think you'd reach back? Do you know where his parents are? Do you? They're not here. They haven't been for some time. - But I'm here. - No, you're not. And this is me reaching out to you. When I see the faces of those three girls... - Three girls? - ...I see you. And I'm begging you to take my hand, because while you were out that night with him... ...Justine Corrigan was bleeding to death in a ditch. Did the giant kill her, too? Charlotte, I'm seeing something in you... that I prayed to God I'd never see again... ...and it scares me to death. Then why are you leaving me? Because I can't run from this. But you are. Don't you know what day it is? How could I forget? You were right, Charlotte. Something is happening. I heard about Justine Corrigan on the news. I just got scared thinking about you... and what could've happened to you this week. We've been friends for so long, and I think I expect you to be the person... I've always known. And I have this dream of us when we were older, that we'd always be sisters. And I know it's not up to me. But I can't let you go through this alone. But I am alone. Whether you're here or not. Let me in, mama. Charlotte... My precious... My baby... Why did you have to do it? I wish that I could've been stronger for you. I wish that I could've protected you. That I could've given you a better world than here. I always knew you wanted to do it. This pit in my stomach every time I came home to see you looking out that back door. All I ever wanted was this life to be a gift to you. All its beauty. All its hope. All its light. Why can't it be? Because... ...now I know better. And my fear is that one day... ...you will, too. Charlotte? Charlotte, honey. It's time to wake up. Baby, have you even moved since last night? What are you doing here? Let's get you out of here. Just for a bit. Did he do this to you? We going or what? Where? The movies. It's, um... We're gonna be late, so... Where were you when I was lost? I'm with you now. Because we promised each other that we always would be. So put everything else behind you... ...like your life depends on it... ...because it might. I see those girls on TV. All I can think about is how lonely they must be now and all the things they'll never know, all the memories they'll never have, of what it'll have been like to live through this summer when a killer walked these streets... ...when we had to sneak out of houses in the middle of the night because there was a curfew and the whole town was so afraid. But we won't let ourselves be. Because maybe one weekend, my parents will be out of town, so we'll sing till we lose our voices and we'll dance all night... ...because we won't let it in... even if it's always knockin'... ...and a voice inside you tells you to open that door. Because it can be so dark out there... ...darker than we would know. Because it won't always be this sweet. And one day... we won't know each other anymore... ...and it may come sooner than you think. Because this summer is gonna go by so, so fast. Charlotte. Charlotte? It will be over before we know it. Did you sleep through the whole thing? Where did we park? Over there. Do you need help setting up? Are you sure it's okay that... we do this? I mean, with your dad and everything. Obviously, I didn't tell him. It's a party, dum-dum. No, I know, but also the curfew. Like that's stopped us before. Okay. It's not... too hard for you to go back there? No. I'm ready to make new memories. Whoa. Look at that. You just gave me chills. Besides, it's our last night. You going somewhere? No, I just... I didn't know you were gonna be home tonight, so... You don't got to lie to me, Charlotte. Well, I promise, I won't stay out too late. Dad. Dad? I'm gonna resign tomorrow, Charlotte. Wh-What are you talking about? Justine Corrigan's boyfriend turned himself in this morning. Older kid. Her friends didn't even know who he was. Said he was high... that he couldn't remember what the hell happened. He just sat there in front of them, crying his eyes out. Some day, someone else is gonna find out who killed Ava Harris or Daphne Bell, but I can't imagine what difference it's gonna make or what clarity it's gonna bring. Justine was stabbed 47 times. I saw her... I know I haven't been strong enough for you, Charlotte. I think in all my pain, I lost sight of yours. But I want... I want you to promise me that when you leave here tomorrow, that... Dad, don't get that. Please. Please don't answer that. I'm sorry. Where in town? Okay. Just get it locked down. Charlotte? Charlie! Oh, look at you! Where's your... Where's your drink? I'm gonna get you a drink. Where's Olivia? Fuckin' A!- Look who decided to show up. - Where's Olivia? - How the hell should I know? I'm not her fucking daddy. - Are you wasted? - Should I not be? - This is the fucking end, man! - This is the end! So will you soon be, too, so come on... waste not, want not, or whatever. - Will, stop. - Come on. What? - Help me help you! - Charlie! Hi! You made it. Dude, it's so fucking hot. I need to talk to you about something. Okay. - Excuse us. - Excuse you. We need to leave. - All of us. - Why? 'Cause your dad is gonna bust us? - No. - Who fucking cares? I changed my mind. I just have a really bad feeling about being there. Shhhhhhh. It's my fucking birthday. I'm not going anywhere. We're not safe here. If not here, then where? You hear that? You're not listening to me. Please dance with me. Please? There's something happening out there. This is gonna be the song we remember the summer by. Why aren't you listening to me? Because... sometimes we need people not to listen to us... make us dance when it hurts... Even when we're scared. Tomorrow, all of this is gonna be gone, and you're gonna wonder how you let it just... get away from you. What's out there is out there. It's just you and me in here. I swear, that storm's been coming all summer. It just all feels like a dream. Everyone's going away. Except we're never gonna wake up. You're crying. Why'd it have to be this way? What are you talking about? I don't want to say goodbye to you, Olivia. Happy birthday! Charlotte! You're leaving me, aren't you? No. I'm just gonna go get some cigarettes. You won't come back. - I'll go. - Don't be... - You been drinking. - Fuck you, Charlotte. I know where you'd rather be. And I can't let you go there. We'll go together. Okay? Because we made a promise, right? Of course. That we'd stay together... ...that we'd keep each other safe. Please. Okay. Can you get my shoes from inside? Okay. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Where's Olivia? Hi! You've reached Olivia's phone, but she's not here. So leave a message. Bye. God damn it, Olivia. Hey. You've reached Olivia's phone... but she's not here right now. So leave a message. Bye. Hey. You've reached Olivia's phone. But she's not here right now. So, um... just leave a message. Bye. Where the hell you think you're going? I'm gonna go find Olivia. It's been over an hour. - No. - And she's not back yet. - No, no, no. - She's not answering her phone. Y... You have a habit of Irish goodbyes. I can't let you leave. I can't, not without one last dance. - Charlotte. - Get your hand off me. Charlotte? Hey, something... What happened? You fainted, and you hit your head, baby. You're probably gonna need stitches. I want you to try and have some water, okay? Can you sit up for me? Close your eyes. Good. Okay. Hey... Lauren, what happened to your clothes? Who are all these people? I don't know these people. Of course, you do, honey. They're our friends. You don't know these people. These moths. I need to know what happened to your clothes. Did somebody do this to you? The giant... What did you say? It's in the house. Where did you get that guitar? What? It was just sitting here. That's not supposed to be here. - He's coming! - This was a mistake. Coming! We shouldn't have come here. This is a bad place. - What's a bad place, honey? - It's a bad place. What's a bad place? It's here. Lauren, honey. Where are you going? What is he gonna do with you? Who? Whoever it is, it ain't me. Lauren? Oh, Charlotte! Sweetheart. It's a jungle run. Alright! Lose them clothes. Olivia's still out there. Are you not worried? Uh... I am worried that you still have your fucking clothes on. Lauren? You can't go. You have to rest. It's all going to be alright, Charlotte. No. Lauren. Taylor... please. What are you so afraid of? The dark? The Giant? I'll kill that son of a bitch myself. Now let's fucking do this! You don't have to stay. Are you here? Do you have any idea how much it hurts to see you look at me this way? I didn't know where else to go. I didn't think you'd ever come back. They took my house... and my truck. No one... No one knows what to do with people like me. People... People with nothing... with no one. And, um... it hurts. It hurts so much that you just... you want someone else to feel it, too. These holes I feel in my chest. Are you gonna hurt me? What happened to us? Joe, look at me. Look at me, please. I don't want you to remember me this way. What do you see? I see something beautiful... ...that's been broken in ways that I can't imagine. Was it real that night? When you kissed me? It was all I ever wanted. I can still taste the cigarettes on your lips. I can smell the fireworks on your clothes. But I just can't tell now... ...if I remember it... or if I was dreaming. What's the difference? I want you to show me. What happened to you that night, Joe? All I wanted was for you to see that I needed you... - That's not what I asked you. - ...to come after me... ...to pull me back. I wanted you back so bad, Joe. Please, don't. You're too late. You have to let me go. I'm sorry, Joe. I have to go. Just tell me you heard it. Please. Just tell me you heard it. Tell me there's something left. It was thunder. No. You don't believe that. There's nothing out there. You need help. Then what are you so afraid of? What happened to you that night, Joe? Don't you see what I see? Don't you hear what I hear? You thought it was just thunder. They're not coming back. What are you doing to me? I'm not. I can't breathe. Just tell me you heard them. You're hurting me. You're hurting me, Joe. I'm not touching you, Charlotte. Olivia! Olivia! Olivia! Olivia! Wait! Wait. Olivia.
