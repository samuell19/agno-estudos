He's a win Come on you guys, we can do it, Come on Christine, just hold on Red Rover, Red Rover, send Bobby Tricker right over! Hi, it's Sam, I'm out, deliberately avoiding your call, leave it to beep Hello, I wasn't sure that was your number until I heard that message, now I know it must be you It's me, Chrissy, what is expecting, that is expecting a child and expecting you to show up like you promised for old gang, maybe not old, but if we stuck If, well, I hope when you're coming in, after all, a promise is a promise! Thomas Wolf once said "You can't go home again" Well that's great for old Tom, but he wasn't a chick who made a pact with her friends when she was 12 to get together whenever any one of them needed each other So here I am, driving back to my childhood home in Indiana A place I can tell you I never wanted to see again I guess a promise is a promise Sure it looks like I picked the wrong way to quit smoking Hi Doc, play some ball? Not today, way too busy ... oh that's for me. ("I'll Be There" by The Jackson Five) Good morning Chrissy, anybody home? Be right there! Just look at your shoulder, honey Hey, soda jiffy pop for you. Thank you Don't go near the stove or you may burst Very funny! But if this baby doesn't come soon I'm gonna have to be reaching and yanking it out myself That would be pretty Where is the list? Ain't got it. Can you believe this tramp? What is it that she has that gets people so excited? - Long legs, a tiny waist and perky breasts - Roberta you know how I feel about swearing Chrissy, breast is not a dirty word - Can't hear you! - Breast - Can't hear you! - Breast - Can't hear you! - Breast! Hey... good to see you. Hi Roberta, you look great. - How you doing? Picture! And you, look at you! Thanks for coming. Hey bitches! Good Lord! - How you doing, star? - Hi Roberta - Good to see you. - Oh God! Picture! - Look at your belly! - Tina Tercell! Teeny, Teeny, Teeny Picture! No, you look good! Yes, I'm a supermodel - Good to see you, Teeny - Yeah, it's been too damn long Come on in - Taa-ta! - It looks exactly like it did when your mum lived here. You know what they say: like mother like daughter. What can I get you to drink? - Jack Daniels - Oh, that would be great We don't keep hard liqueur in the house Whatever you have, anything is fine Root beer? - Great - Good. - Be back in a jiffy I've been looking for one of these. - I can't believe you kept this thing - Morton wanted to tear it down and put a doll boy, but I just couldn't part with it Besides it's not mine to tear down, belongs to all of us I really want to thank you guys for showing up. Hey, don't worry about it, Chrissy, I think you'll make a great mum A little overbearing and rigid, but by the grace of God, they can come out relatively unharmed, and if not, there is always therapy I can not believe you're having a baby Chrissy, make me feel very old. This whole baby thing baffles I mean you have it, raise it, you inevitably screw it up it resents you, feel guilty for resenting you, Then it has a baby which only perpetuates the vicious cycle Thank you Oscar the Grouch! - So Sam, what are you working on now? - My tenth If you ask me, you ought to write a book about something people can relate to I didn't understood half of that "aliens next door" thing You take that as a compliment? Why don't you write a romance novel like Danielle Steel? Now there is lady who knows how to write a page turner It's true Roberta, the longer they're gone, the weirder they get You know what? I'd just like to see you guys more often What it's been, huh? 10 years since you've been back? Don't give me any grief Roberta, for example, has chosen to be... alternative! she lives in sin with her boyfriend but she is still normal. Yes I'm normal She hasn't had 4 failed marriages or endless series of monogamous relationships ... or wear black - She is happy. - Technically, I have only married 3 times, the first one was annulled. See? Oh, you do think everything is so funny; if you ask me, you both need to grow up Maybe you're right Shelby, Indiana was not the most exciting place to grow up In fact, the most common cause of death before puberty was boredom And in the days before MTV and Nintendo, we had to find ways to entertain ourselves The summer of 1970 started out like any other summer School ended and we had 3 months of freedom ahead of us But that freedom wasn't enough, we wanted independence A place to call our own. That's why we decided to buy the tree house And the quest to earn money was our summer goal The 4 of us lived in the Gaslight Addition It was a dream neighborhood. A brand new free plan community built when new was in and old was out I'm tired of this, I don't want to hear it anymore. - But what? - Calm down please. I'm tired of talking about these things. How many times we'll have this conversation? - We have tried for years - Maybe you spend more time at home. No! Say what for? Come on My parents had been fighting for as long as I could remember It never bothered me. It was the opposite actually, it was comfort and consistency No matter what I do, they just keep getting bigger! You'd better hurry up, your breakfast is getting cold Roberta grew up with her dad and 3 older brothers her mother died when she was 4. That's her in the picture Roberta never left the house without that picture. Tina, tell us how you felt at the exact moment when you realized you had won? Well, I can only say that I've thought about this day ... that I've thought about this day, dreamed about this day for as long as I can remember To win an Academy Award at such a young age is an enormous accomplishment, where'd you go from here? Teeny was an only child, her parents were country clubbers, never around really Typical upbringing for actors and pathological liars. 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98 ... Chrissy, oh sorry honey, can I come in? Sure! Oh honey, keep this closed, records get dusty Oh oh, cubby up, cubby down, is that the right way? You know what, Chrissy, I've been thinking about what you asked me. About sex? Yes dear, you said it very casually, very scary for mammy, like somebody going - "boom", that's what sex is - I'm sorry, mammy Well, it's all right, it's fine, I believe you're too young to be informed but since your friends are trash mouths, I think you should hear it from me, the facts. This is gonna come as a shock to you, but... This is a flower, right? OK, well, all women have a garden And a garden needs a big hose to water it ... or a small hose as long as it works As a direct result of this conversation, Chrissy would spend a significant part of her adult life obssessed with garden Those are the Wormers, everyone in the neighborhood felt sorry for their mother. Like us, the Wormers also had a summer goal. It was to make our lives miserable. They were the enemy Hey wormy Wormers! Now! Chrissy down! Go, go, go! Roberta, you okay? We owe you Wormers, and we always pay our debts! As if we are afraid of a bunch of girls! You should be! ("Band of Gold" by Freda Payne) Your idea of foreplay is: a) a candle-lit dinner and moonlight walk on the beach b) making out on a bear skin rug in a remote log cabin c) watching a sexy movie, or d) all of the above. B E, none of the above. Roberta, that's not a possible answer B, I guess Definitely A Surprise, surprise! I pick D, all of the above Surprise, surprise! That's 107 dollars and 24 cents So how much more do we need? - 23 more dollars and the tree house is ours Hey, I said the first night we get a slumber party Oh Sam, get around to your mom! - How short are those shorts! - How tall are those boots! ("These Boots Are Made For Walking" by Nancy Sinatra) I had no idea why, but earlier that summer, my mom began to dress like Nancy Sinatra Wow, your mom is so cool! Hey you guys, there is full moon tonight, festival of the spirits who came back to earth and walked among the living 4 Black Cows, that'd be $1.60 boys We're girls I know - She is so odd! - What did you expect? She's a witch I swear! She's got Voodoo dolls and everything I saw them. And hear this: One of the dolls looked exactly like Principal Winters, and you know what? There was a needle sticking right in the middle of his heart I saw it the morning before he had his heart attack So, do we try another seance tonight? It didn't work last time and it's not gonna work this time It will work, this is the one night when the barrier between the death and the living can be broken - I read in the Encyclopedia of Supernatural Phenomena. - You are so weird - I'm in. - Yeah, me too. Here the scores. Roberta, you're a woman on the verge, although your sensuality is yet to be tapped, is like a volcano ready to erupt. Wow, everybody look out for Roberta - That's crap. - Samantha, you walk the fine line between romanticism and sex appeal, don't be afraid to take the plunge, you might surprise yourself - I'll keep that in mind. - Chrissy, let go of your inhibitions, before you dry up like a prune What's that supposed to mean? Now me: Teeny, you are a sexual magnet attracting men from the 4 corners of the world, pace yourself. I'll pick the rest of my stuff when the girls are out the house - No need to move out - Please, we passed that point. This just isn't working I decided not to tell the others about my father Call me a fool, but I actually thought he'd be back A wishful notion I held on to for years At the time no one in the Gasliht Addition had gotten a divorce And the last thing I wanted was to be different from my friends. Freezing, it's so cold out here. Take my shirt, now I'll be cold, but maybe you'll shut up - It makes me look fat. - You are fat. I am not fat ... Am I fat? Now hold hands with the person sitting next to you, palm to palm. - Let's contact Marilyn Monroe. - She didn't cooperate last time. No one ever cooperates! I think we should bring back someone buried in this cemetery. How about Dear Johnny? Let's find out how he died Close your eyes, guide us in our pursuit of the spiritual world, keep our circle safe from those who promote evil and seek to harm Dear Johnny, we know you were just a kid when you died. We wanna find out how - I'm here! - Concentrate Dear Johnny, can you hear me? If you can hear me, give us a sign, let us know It's okay, we just wanna talk to you, tell us how you died He's here ... - He wants to tell us his story. - Chrissy? I think we should stop. He is afraid Tell him not to be afraid, tell him it's okay He's all by himself, he's lonely, he needs a friend I got you! - Hey, that hurt! - You deserve it, fart ass! If you ever do that again. I'm sorry you guys, but you're so gullible when it comes this seance stuff, I mean it's just all pretend, right? Chrissy! Where you going? Somebody get her before she gets a heart attack! - Chrissy, back! - Chrissy wait up! We're behind you! Come on, Sam! - Sam, we got to get out of here. - You guys, there's somebody out there! - I don't see anyone. Probaby just the wind or something Roberta, why can't you just act like a girl? Look what you've done. What? You know I hate getting dirty It's nothing It's Crazy Pete. Let's cut to the field Base to Chrissy, base to Chrissy What? We need a secret meeting Now? Remember I saw someone in the cemetery after the seance? I think he came to my bedroom - Who? - Dear Johnny. - Give me a break! - This is really a bad idea. This is definitely not a good idea Shut up Chrissy or I beat the crap out of you right now! -Ditto Sam! Are you okay? - Holy cow! - We did it. We actually did it. He's back, we brought him here Nothing on Dear Johnny, everything before 1948 was lost in a fire but Ms. Wendy says the Greenfield Library carries copies of all the county newspapers - That settles that. - That settles what? We can't ride our bikes all the way to Greenfield Can we? ("No Matter What" by Badfinger) - Truth or dare, Roberta? - Truth How big are your boobs now? Drop dead! She has to say, doesn't she Sam? She doesn't have to say if she doesn't want to - Then can we see them? - No you can't see them! - And yours grow? - I don't have any grown ones yet You'll get them, and you'll hate them No, you're lucky Roberta, men love when they're big Look how big are mine today They almost look real It filled with pudding Pudding? The Wormers actually gave me the idea Jelly-o is too jiggly Pudding has a heavier, more realistic texture What flavor is it? It's vanilla. - Chrissy, truth or dare? - Truth Have you ever been French kissed? Are you kidding? I don't wanna get pregnant! You can't get pregnant from kissing! I know that, beetle brain, but it's common knowledge that if you tongue kiss a boy, he'll automatically think you'll do the deed with him, they can't help it, they are driven, it's the male curse! And what deed would that be? You know, planting the seed and watering the flower Isn't that how it works? The man takes his watering can and sprinkles it on the flower ("Knock Three Times" by Tony Orlando and Dawn) - I think it's time for a break - But we haven't ridden that far since lunch - Come on, Chrissy. - Fine, go ahead, leave me here. - Chrissy! - I don't care but I'm taking a break Wait, listen, turn it off It's beautiful Wow! Where did it go? What? What? It's in your hair Get it out! I can't, it's ...runny Chrissy, calm down Look out below! Roberta, it's too shallow! Bombs away! Where did she go? Roberta! Roberta! Oh my God! Roberta! No! Roberta! Roberta! Roberta! Come on, get her up She stopped breathing! Someone's got to give her mouth to mouth - You do mouth to mouth then CPR! - Other way around! Okay! Oh Roberta. Well, it's good to know who your true friends are - You know, I was gonna do it - Me too, I really was Chrissy here is the only one who is really... Chrissy! - Don't you ever do anything like that to me again, ever! - It was a joke! That wasn't the first time Roberta faked her own death. Earlier that year she'd scared the hell out of us when she jumped off the roof and pretented she broke her neck None of us had experienced a loss like Roberta's and we didn't understand her jokes But she kept trying to make that funny, maybe to make it easier for herself. What was that? Look, I'm sorry, if it means anything to you, I really appreciate you was on that mouth to mouth thing. You scared me to death I'm sorry Roberta, you're my best friend Hey, hell of a right hook you got there Roberta, don't swear Hey, you guys come here! - Oh my God! - What? - I saw his penis. - Whose? - And the balls. - Whose? Scott's Oh my God! Great, now I'm the only one who's not seen Scott's thing, that will be topic of conversation for the rest of the summer You're forcing me to look. Chrissy nobody's forcing you to do anything OK, I'll look, but I wanna to make this perfectly clear: I'm looking under protest Yeah, right! It's not very big - What so funny? - It's only big when the guy has a hard-on - And when that happens, it'll get this big - What's a hard-on? Doesn't your mother tell you anything? I'm beginning to think she's been misinformed Hey you guys Let's do it! ("Hitchin' A Ride" by Vanity Fair) Get ready to make a mad dash Yeah, you'd better start now. Buzz off, pug head! No, I'm serious. Get going This is too easy Hey Wormers, it's payback time! Come and get it, suckers! - Hey, you'd better get those back! - Yeah, dream on, asshole! Come on, you guys! Come on, Chrissy Al right, joke's over! Give our clothes back, dammit! Please! Come and get them! Come and get them! All for one and one for all! - Come on, Chrissy. - Hey you guys, wait up I think I'm allergic to dust. Nothing happened in April - Nothing ever happens in Shelby - I'm kind of like it that way Nothing What's wrong? It's my mum It was a head-on collision, the driver of the pickup truck fell asleep at the wheel ... She was pinned in the car for an hour and a half before she was rescued She was fully conscious when rescue workers attempted to extract her from the demolished vehicle She died during the night at the Green County hospital of massive head injuries and severe internal bleeding - I don't understand this, this isn't right - What do you mean? It must've been awful for her. A lot of pain. She was very beautiful, wasn't she? Like a movie star. - Hey you guys, I think I found something - Read it Funeral services will be held on Saturday for 12-year old Jonathan Simms and his mother 36-year old Beverly Ann Simms Due to unexpected and tragic circumstances involved in deaths, the family asked the services remain private That's it, there's nothing else -What you mean that's it, how did they die? Wait a minute Pages have been torn out Somebody's gone a lot of trouble to keep Dear Johnny's death a mystery. ("All Right Now" by Free) Hey Hey Are you in the army? Was Vietnam? Was Did you kill anyone over there? Not because I wanted to Did you get shot? That's a great song Does it hurt your leg? Yeah, hurts like hell That bullet was the best thing that happened to me What you mean? Got me a seat on next plane home But we were winning, right? Nobody's winning Want a sip? - Thanks. Smoke? - Yeah. Sure I love to smoke Smoking stunts your growth Smooth So did you get a Purple Heart? Yeah How come you not wear it? Yeah, it's a huge honor, right? No On the news they said the U.S. was really starting to gain ground over there Forget about that, OK? Forget what you heard about it, forget what you saw Even the people who were over there lied about what they seen, or done Doesn't seem that you can believe in much anymore You can believe in yourself If you're lucky So are you gonna be sticking around here for a while? No, I try not to stick around anywhere, you know what I mean? - Yeah, sure - Definitely - Is that an earring you're wearing? - Yeah You're a hippie, aren't you? You're a trip My mum says all hippies are sex fiends I can tell you something that I wish somebody told me when I was your age - What's that? - Your parents aren't always right No shit! It's getting late, I think we should get going I guess she's right Thanks Bye See you Bye Hey ... Whatever it is you're looking for, I hope you find it Yeah Peace - Where's my daddy? - I told you, honey, he had to go away for a little while - But you'll be able to see him soon. - Every other weekend and holidays? But I want to see him now! I wish you could honey, but you can't - Hey Angela, I saw Crazy Pete yesterday - You kids leave that poor old man alone, you hear me? - Why you dress like that anyway? - Like what? Like that, it's embarrassing - Anybody home? - Don't move! - Hello! - It's just Grandma - What's going on? - Your grandmother is upset because your father moved out So? You let her yell at him, he's the one who left I know you're in there! I saw your car in the garage! - Hide! - What? Hide! - You have to go to him! - I hate this! Open the damn door! This is it The suspicious lack of details surrounding Dear Johnny's death led us to the one person we knew could help us to find out more Yes? We need your help I'm a little blue today, boys Come on, give her the money Maybe this will cheer you up Come on in I can't believe we are spending 10 tree house dollars on... - What brings you here today? - We've been contacted by a spirit. - His name is Jonathan Simms - I know - I feel a strong spiritual presence here. - For 10 tree house dollars I feel it too Silence! The spirits are here and yes, they wanna talk to you Okay, I want you to shuffle these twice and cut them 3 times facing me Relax your minds and bodies and be open to his presence We want to find out how he died. - Did you see the look on her face? - She was scared - You guys, we let us into a fake - She was scared and so were you - But what do we do now? - The spirits haunt the living for a purpose - Dear Johnny wants us to find out how he died. - You saw the card. He was murdered. - Maybe he wants us to settle the score - Come on, this is getting out of hand We need to talk to someone who is alive when he died Like who? My grandma, she is the oldest person I know She has a poker game this afternoon but she said we can stop by tomorrow morning - Your grandmother plays poker? - She likes to gamble Oh wait, but I promised my dad to paint our garage door tomorrow. I mean come on guys, it's $10 - Hey Kenny, where's the fire? - Softball game, Kennel's field - Let's go! - It's gonna be all boys So what are we waiting for? Come on Roberta, you can do it! Guys, come This is for yesterday Come on Roberta, you can do it! Hit it over their heads. Shut up! Don't pay attention to him Roberta. Concentrate Yes! Come on Roberta, touchdown! - Hello dear - Get lost, nerdo Who are you kidding? Girls can't play softball! What did you say? I said girls can't play softball What's she doing? Roberta, remember you're a lady. Why don't you go home and play with your dolls? The only doll Roberta's got is a G.I. Joe Fight! Enough! Roberta, look at your hair - You wimp, crazy bitch - Foul mouth! How does it feel to get the crap kicked out of you by a girl, huh? It's too bad your mother's dead, somebody needs to teach you to act like a girl Fight! There you are! Samantha, I want you to meet a friend of mine, this is Mr. Kent Hi Samantha, why, your mom has been telling me all kinds of great things about you Says you're a real good kid, so pleasure Great pleasure to meet you, little lady, you're a looker too. Just like your mammy So Samantha, your mom tells me you're real interested in science. Science fiction. You've ever been to Smithsonian? Oh, let me tell you that's something to see That place is big, bigger than big Maybe we might need to plan a trip to D.C. before school starts, what do you think? That would be just great! Wouldn't that just be great, Samantha? I think we all might have a pretty good time My dad's gonna take us there Well, hell Mr. Kent? Oh, please call me Bud Bug? No! Bud, d, b-u-d Well, Budd, you have a piece of food stuck in your teeth Damn it! It's okay, just hold on.. - How is my.... - Oh, it's gone, it's gone It's gone? Thanks. First date jitters Wow, that's a pretty scarf Oh thank you, Angela - Use this. - Thank you - I got your chair pretty good there - It's fine Samantha? Samantha! Love means never having to say you're sorry How's the movie? Tear jerker How come you're up so late? Just need to do some thinking. In the summer? - Want to go to the tree house? - Sure You're not following through Who asked you? See you Hey! - You're pretty good. You know? - Thanks - I mean not just for a girl, you know, for a guy - Thanks - Hey, you want a pop or something? - Cool, that'd be great - Roberta? - What? Why do you fight all the time? It's just something I do, I guess Cause, I was wondering.. I think you're a really nice girl I always thought you hated me So did I - Roberta? - What? - Can I kiss you? - What are you mumbling? Would it be all right if... Can I kiss you? I guess - Great, ready? - You wanna do it now? - Sure, I mean if you want to. - Okay - That was great - It was okay - Scott? - Yeah? If you mention this to anyone, especially your brothers, I'll beat the shit out of you! Okay Truth or dare? Truth If you were stranded on a deserted island with me, Chrissy and Roberta... and there was nothing to eat whatsoever, who would you kill for food? I dispute the question. The odds that happening are slim and nil You still have to answer Then Chrissy, I guess Why? Because she'll feed more people Truth or dare? Truth Do you like your parents? I don't really know my parents, but as far as I can tell, they are assholes You know, I believed what the soldier said, like your parents aren't always being right I mean just because they're adults doesn't mean they know shit - I never thought they did - I did - My dad moved out, they're getting a divorce - But I thought your parents got along - I lied. - Why? I don't know, just wanted a normal family, you know? Like the Brady Bunch Well, 6 kids sharing one bathroom does not sound like fun to me Besides, Mike and Carol are widowed - Then the Partridge Family - Shirley Johnson is widow Buffy and Jody, they are orphans Kochabelly's father, widower; My Three Sons, widower; Bonanza, widower Beverly Hillbillies, widower You see Sam, there are no perfect families. It is normal for things to be shitty I may be normal But it still hurts All those parents died, Teeny My dad chose to leave. I really miss him. - I'll always be here for you - Thanks What are you doing? You love those When you're 12, without effort you live in the moment You don't regret the past or worry about the future and at that moment in the tree house, Teeny filled my heart with hope and comfort - Best friends for life - For life - We better go - Yeah You know, I heard that in another 10 years, half the population is gonna be divorced I find that really hard to believe Come on, let's get out of here - Teeny! - What? - It's gone! - What'd you lose? My bracelet, it just fell off! Well, let's come back in the morning. It's raining. We have to find it now! There it is! - Look. I don't see it - It's in there. See? I'll get it - Damn! - It's okay, I can get it - Be careful! - I will, hold that - Got it? - Yeah - Watch your head. There's a lot of stuff down here Look! A yo-yo. Cool! Hurry up, okay? It's really starting to pour - I got it! - Great, now come on, let's get out of here Okay. Samantha! Sam! Sam! Sam! Teeny, give me your hand! - I slip! - No! - Hold on! - No! - Sam! - Help me! Teeny! Somebody, help! I'm coming Sam! Teeny, help me! No! Teeny! Sam! Sam! Okay. It's over. You're all right. Why are you afraid of me? It is weird the way that you only come out at night. It's kind of scary, you know? Yeah, well, I don't like to see a lot of people. I don't think they like to see a lot of me. You get her home, huh? See you around, Pete If he wouldn't have been there Sam ... Tiny and I both knew what would've happened had he not been there And on that night we caught a glimpse of a hero in Crazy Pete ("Sugar Sugar" by The Archies) Roberta, you missed a spot Why don't you get your butt off your asshole and help? You know if I don't eat every few hours I get nauseous - Wormer alert! - I thought there's something foul - Maybe it's your armpit, lard bite! - Oh your wit astounds me! Come on man, let's get out of here Ladies - What's his problem? - Maybe he's a lard person Maybe he's not such a creep after all That was the day Roberta quit taping her boobs I didn't know you'd bring in the whole neighborhood. Come on in Got a whole pitch of fresh lemonade for you Sit down, girls - Samantha, how you're holding up? - I'm fine grandma - I've been worried to death about you - I'm really okay She's just fine, Mrs. Robertson, we're taking good care of her Well, I'm glad to hear it Let's see now, we have extra company, 1-2-3, so I'll get some glasses and you can ask me this important question - Sam, why's your grandma so worried about you? - Who knows? Chrissy, Roberta, Teeny, and Samantha, and me, bottoms up! - How is it? - It's great It's refreshing. Grandma, do you remember a little boy our age and his mother who died here in 1945? Jonathan and Beverly Ann Simms We were just wondering how they died? - Did something terrible happen to them? - Yes - But it's the kind of thing you don't want to hear about. - Please we wanna know - You'll have nightmares for weeks - Come on Mrs. Albertson, tell us Yeah, come on grandma, what happened? It took me a long time to forget that terrible tragedy, Samantha. I don't want to dredge it up again You're just like your grandpa, all that junk he piled up in the attic And a weird fascination, curious about everything that went on in this town Oh God, dear Lord Drink up everyone! I'd love to chat, but got a big bingo tournament over in Farmland Get a move on, girls! I wanna make sure I get some good cards this time. Come on, get out - Your keys. - Hurry everbody, let's go Hurry it up, we're gonna be late Bye, grandma Bye, Mrs. Albertson - You come and see me again soon, Samantha - Okay They must love bingo We really should hurry up, we could get in trouble for this - Come on, Chrissy - Don't drop me Okay, on three! Pull 1 ... 2 ... 3! I know grandpa's scrap books are in here somewhere - Find anything? - Not yet. Sam, I think I found something. Those are my parents They make a great couple Yeah Jackpot! They were murdered Beverly Ann Simms and her 12 year old son Jonathan were found brutally murdered.. late Friday night, their bodies were discovered by Peter Simms... After leaving his car at a bar around midnight he entered his house... To find his wife and son had been shot to death The sheriff's department believes the burglar was caught off-guard and killed the two witnesses when they apparently woke from their sleep. They've no clues as to a suspect. The sheriff has every reason to believe that the robber was probably just passing through and has left the area It's an editorial from my grandfather to the paper What appears to be, isn't that at all. That's the knowledge we've gained from the brutal deaths of Jonathan and Beverly Ann Simms. If we thought Shelby was a safe sleepy town, sheltered from the violence of the outside world... we were deceived. Shelby is a safe town, if something like this could happen here, think how bad it must be out there Roberta, it's okay No, it's not okay! Why did they have to die? Why did she have to die? My dad lied to me, said these beautiful angels moved to earth and carried her away Before she's started to feel any pain - Why did she have to die? - Why did he have to lie to me? He's all I have left any more It's not all you have left. All I can count on is you guys - I know how you feel. - What do you mean? - My dad moved out, they are getting a divorce. - A divorce? I'm sorry, Sam Screw them. You guys have us I say we make a pact, here and now. We're here for each other always no matter what happens in life If Teeny goes off to Hollywood or I marry a rich doctor, we'll remember this day and this pact whenever we need a friend we're here for each other, we can count on it, always, no matter what It's a pact - All for one. - And one for all. Now more than ever we need to put Dear Johnny to rest - Everyone ready? - Ready We brought Dear Johnny back from the dead and it's up to us to send him home Close your eyes Guide us in our pursuit of the spirit world, keep our circle safe from those who promote evil and seek to harm Dear Johnny, we know you and your mother were brutally murdered ... Did you came back to tell us who did it? We're here to help you rest in peace, Johnny. We're listening He's here Don't break the circle. Tell us who did it, Johnny, we're here to help Holy Molly! - That's the killer - Please don't hurt us! Hey, this isn't a playground, it's a cemetery And you kids should have a litte respect for the dead - Hey, we have a lot of respect for the dead, okay? - Yeah, that's why we're here - We resurrected Dear Johnny from the grave - Oh really? How do you think his tombstone got cracked on the middle? I.. knocked it over with my tractor You did? Yeah, a-ha, it's not easy moving around all these headstones I'm not doing anymore of these dumb seances, they are a waste of time I can't believe how we did it - What about the tarot cards, then? - Get over it I knew at that moment our days of playing make-believe were over As we grow older it becomes difficult to just believe It's not that we don't want to, but too much has happened that we can't Let's go Hey look, it's Crazy Pete Let's leave him alone, okay? - What's wrong? - I forgot something in the cemetery, I'll catch up - You want me to come with you? - No, I'll be okay Pete? You're Peter Simms? They were my family. It's a terrible thing that happened to them, I'm sorry For the longest time I thought I could've stopped him, if I would've been home instead of down at that bar But you were there for me I've wasted a lot of years, afraid to face people, mostly afraid to face myself I'm scared too - What's your name? - Samantha Well, Samantha, things will happen in your life that you can't stop... but that's no reason to shut out the world, there's a purpose for the good and for the bad He gave me the only gift he could, the lesson that had taken him a lifetime to learn And although I understood the importance of his words, it's only now, looking back, that I understand their meaning Rest in peace, Dear Johnny - Do I look better with this? - Yeah, right. We all used to try so hard to fit in. We wanted to look exactly alike, do all the same things, Practically be the same people, and when we weren't looking, that changed, the tree house was supposed to bring us more independence, but what the summer actually brought was independence from each other Samantha! Samantha! Samantha! Samantha! - What? - Your car's blocking my jeep - Oh shit! - It's coming, I think I saw its head - You saw it's head? - You can see its head? You didn't see its head - I'll get the keys. - No, forget the keys, take the limo - The limo? - Take the limo. We'll take your limo, go get the bags, call Morton - Ok. - No, wait, don't leave me alone. Get the car before another of those bits - How you doing? - Hi - Get out, I need your car - Pardon me? I have a pregnant lady here and I have to get her to the hospital No problem, tell me where it is and I'll get you there in a jiffy Well, jiffy is not good enough Move out, bastard! See? Thank you very much. - Just tell him his wife's getting a baby. - Have a nice day. Go! - This is pretty good suspension! - Sorry! Morton is in the middle of a root canal but he'll meet us at the hospital There is cool room back here - You should be doing this? - There is a VCR... I can't believe there is a VCR - Roberta, there's a VCR in here! - Yeah, does it have a remote? Okay, enough screaming, thank you Breathe, breathe! - Chrissy, your uncle! - Oh shit! No swearing around my baby Shiiit! Chris you're gonna have to push Come on Chrissy, push I changed my mind about the drugs - It's too late for that. - Give me the drugs or I'll kill you! - Give her the drugs, just give her the drugs! - Hey, you're gonna have to calm down, all right? Now push, Chris, push! Come on, I can see the head, I see the head You really can see its little head - Is it supposed to look like that? - Yes, Chris you're doing great - Is it a boy or a girl? - I don't know, so far it's just a head All right, we're almost there, one more big one, Chris, you can do it! Here comes the big one, Chrissy, push, you're almost there, you're almost there, one more big one, Chris, come on! - I want it out, get out, get out! - Get it out of her, get it out of her! It's a girl, a beautiful baby girl My baby. - Am I too late? - No Morton, get your baby - Hello, dear - We have a baby girl Thanks. You're welcome. - See? - She really is beautiful - You know, kinda looks like a Russian limo! - Very funny, Roberta! Chrissy ... truth or dare? - Truth - Are you happy? Yes! I'm so happy I feel like just bust and shoot happiness all over everywhere - Roberta, truth or dare? - Truth Just how big are your boobs now? - Well, just how big are your boobs? - 36 D and worth every penny. - D? Oh no. - Sam, truth or dare? - Truth - Are you happy? Not really, but I just figure that it's normal for things to be shitty Look, I got A+ on career day, I must've missed that class on personal relationships Maybe you should integate color into your wardrobe, men love pastels on a woman It's not about pastels or men, it's about me What are you talking about Sam? I've had how many relationships and how many years, and I've run from every one of them which doesn't make it easy to get to that next level - The intimacy level - Well, if you don't fall in love, you can't get hurt But it sure is lonely all by yourself Yeah, it is - Hey, you guys remember that summer with Crazy Pete? - God, we loved a mystery, didn't we? - Did we have fun that summer or what? - Yeah, it was the best. You know I used to send Crazy Pete a Christmas card every year with some cash They came back last year Yeah, he died You know, I never told you guys this, but Pete was Dear Johnny's father - What? - He was? How did you know that? Do you remember our last seance in the cemetery? I went back and Pete was there putting flowers on Johnny's grave He said something that didn't mean as much then as it does now He told me that things happen in life that you can't stop But it wasn't a reason to shut out the world. I realized that I've been so afraid of the bad things that that I missed out on the good You know I didn't wanna come back here But I'm really glad I did I've forgotten how much it helped to have you guys as friends We're really lucky to have this place, and each other Boy, there is a part of me that would like just to stay here forever I wouldn't go that far But it would be nice to come back and visit more often I agree Let's make a pact ("Now And Then" by Susanna Hoffs) - All for one. - And one for all. Come on! You can run from the disappointments to try to forget... But it's only when you embrace your past that you truly move forward Maybe Thomas Wolf never got to go home again But I found my way there, and I'm glad I did
