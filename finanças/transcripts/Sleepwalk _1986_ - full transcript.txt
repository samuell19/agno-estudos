Property of the great temple of Yinchuan... on the one hill river. Not until the Year of the Dog can these tales be told. Both the power of the moon... and only one chosen person can unravel the knot. Only one... among these many stories fits the prophecy. And only one key... -Finding the keys... -...will unlock the message. Mortals, do not question the will of immortals in the Year of the Dog. Where's the first page? These are the first pages. We must have the first page. It's the key! Easy Type, can I help you? Yes, we do. Could you hold on a minute? My other phone is ringing. Easy Type. Yes, sir, I'll check right into that and get back to you. Please hold on. Easy Type. Easy Type, can you hold on one minute? Ow! Easy Type, can you hold on one minute? Would you hold on a minute? Easy Type. You are talking to the boss. Hi. It's Matt. - You wanna see Nicole? - Yeah, only a minute. Your roommate's here. How about Italian? I like Italian. Have you lost weight? On second thought, maybe Italian's not such a good idea. I don't know, but you look thinner to me, Matt. I don't know. I don't know. It's heavy. How about Chinese? Oh, Nicky, are you still working? I thought you weren't going to work overtime anymore. Oh, I still have all these medical charts to finish. Oh, it's not even five o'clock yet. Oh, it must be quick. You know, I go home at night, I've got these... It's like, green flashes going off behind my eyes. It's from staring at this stupid screen all day. Green flashes? Hmm. Well, maybe you shouldn't sit so close to it. Nicky. Yeah? Do you think... maybe you could... lend me some money? I don't have any money for a cab. My purse is over there, just take some. Oh, thank you. I had some money, but I spent it. But I promise you, I can pay you back tomorrow. Oh, wait a minute. There's nothing in here but two tokens! Well, you can take one. No! I can't take the subway! Who would go into that smelly pit? Now how am I going to get home? I know. I'll wait and I'll walk downtown with you, okay? Wait 'til you see these shoes, you're going to die. They're so great! Can't wait to try them on so you can see them. Hmm. There's nowhere to sit in here. Nicky, you should have a place for your guests to sit when they come and visit you. You know, like a chair or something. Can I sit here? Yeah, sure. You know, you're going to put all that weight you lost back on eating those things. Did you know that every potato chip is what, seventy-five calories? Seventy-five calories! I'm not kidding you. And you ate a whole bag of them. I wonder how many chips are in a bag. How many would you say? Fifty? Seventy? One hundred? They are not potato chips, they are potato skins. Would you answer the phone for me? I'll be right back. Listen, I'm talking from experience. I used to be fat! I still have to watch out or I'll blow up like a balloon. You know, I get that celluloid all over my thighs. Hey, where you going? I'm going to the bathroom. Okay. Those... Those really make your legs look great. Oh, yeah? And what do you know about legs? Hello. How do you do? Hello. My name is Barrington Rutley III. I was going for my PhD in paleography until recently, when I decided to quit academia and pursue the more unorthodox teachings of the most honorable Dr. Guo. That's a funny name. That means "dog" in Chinese. But you must know that. No, it doesn't mean that, it means, "He who comes down from the mountains to teach us all to be humble." No, it doesn't. It means dog! Pleased to meet you, Dr. Guo. Wait a minute, Dr. Guo. We don't know for certain if she speaks Chinese. Oh. The boss has left for the day. You'll have to come back tomorrow. We don't want to see your boss. We only want you. You must never let this document leave your sight. Well, how about when I go to sleep? This is not a joke. Listen... Just take this. I don't want to do it. That's the oldest signature there is. But... that's too much money. Are you crazy? Look at all the... "Too much money"? Take it! This is just a humble retainer. When you work for the honorable Dr. Guo, you get highly compensated. All we ask is that you have this translated and transcribed in three days. No later. What are you guys, CI-spooks or something? Who's been fooling around with my desk? Has someone been fooling around with my desk? And who are those guys? I mean, does anyone know who those guys are? I don't know. Your roommate's been taking work behind my back, hasn't she? I'm going to talk to Nicole. Should I answer the phone? You've been taking work behind my back, isn't that right? You've been taking work behind my back! Hello? Yes, this is Isabelle. How did you know I was here? Who is this? Oh, Jack! This is a translating job. It has nothing to do with the shop. I just want to rent the machine, I'll pay you money for it, and I'll only work at night. I'll use just that one light, and the light in the bathroom when I go to the bathroom. I don't know what the problem is. I mean, I'll make some money and you'll make some money. All right. Who was that? It was Nicky's boyfriend. But I'll give her the message. Well, looks like I'm working late after all. So, do you think you can lend me some money now? Yeah. Is this all? Can't I have another 20? Okay, all right, it's fine. So what time do you think you'll be home tonight? I'm not sure. Um... Tell Jimmy I'll be home at ten. Well, I don't know what time I'll be home myself. All right, I guess he'll be okay alone until I get home. Okay, bye-bye, see you later. See you. Nicole? Would you make sure the lights are out before you leave? All right. Goodnight. Goodnight. The flock of birds flies in the chamber where the princess sleeps. The birds make a nest... ...in her long wavy hair. The princess awakes... The princess awakes... then shoos them away. They fly out the window all, but one princely bird who demands as a keepsake a lock of her hair to undo his spell. The princess refuses. The princess refuses. The bird says... ..."Very well. Come the dry season, like leaves off the trees, your hair will fall." The princess laughs. The bird speaks again. "When it rains, flowers will bloom, leaves will return. But tell me, princess. When will you get your hair back? When will you get your hair back?" When will you get your hair back? Cross me! Cross me! -That's Jimmy's mother? -She don't look Chinese. What the hell is this? So, what'd you do today? Nothing. Nothing? Well, that sounds really boring. Smells kind of funny. Smells like almonds. Is Isabelle home yet? I'm hungry. Where have you been? I'm sorry, I had to work late. Actually, I'm going to have to work late for the next couple of days, too. You know, if you get hungry, you should just fix yourself a peanut butter sandwich or something. Can I stay up 'til midnight? Mm, I don't know, maybe. Mommy, what happened to your finger? Oh, nothing. Can you open that for me? Yeah. Here. Thanks. You know, you're right, Jimmy. This does smell really weird. Like it's old or something. Like almonds. Smells like cyanide. Oh, Jimmy, come on. You know, cyanide smells like almonds. -I read that in comic books. -Hmm. Maybe that's why I heard that before. Want me to show you? No, no, wait. Dinner's almost ready. Tonight was the worst night of my life. Mon petit chou. Mm. You know, I don't know why they're so paranoid about this thing. All it is, is these old Chinese nursery rhymes. Yeah, they sure paid you a pile of money for them. There were a few 20's and 10's, but it was mostly singles. Well, I was just curious, but, um... How much money was in that pile anyway? Jimmy and I really missed you last night. Where were you? I had a date. But it should've been our last one because we broke up tonight. With who? With Michael? Michael? Oh, no, I've had it with him. I told him last week it was either me or junk. He hasn't called, has he? No, we're through. So who was it? Andy? Andy? Oh, no, I've had it with him, too. He was so whiny, so needy, you know, demanding to see me all the time. He was so in love with me. It was driving me nuts. So, who was this guy? You never go to their house. Well... I guess that was an exception. Oh, come on. You always bring them here. What, you didn't want me to meet him? Oh, men are such babies. I've had it with him. Yeah, I'm thinking of breaking up with Jack. Oh, yeah, Jack called. He did? When? Right before you came home. It's a good thing I didn't let him talk to you, huh? What do you mean? When did he call? Oh, he called today at the office when you were busy with those two weird guys. Oh, shit. I was supposed to see him tonight. What did he say? Oh, I don't know, something about going out of town tonight or tomorrow morning -or something. -What? Where? -Where's he going? -I don't know, he didn't say. Well, did you ask? I forgot. Oh, great. That's really great. Jimmy, go to bed, please. So call him now. I'm going to go wash my hair. My scalp feels itchy. Oh, I should just go to his house. In a faraway land, where the sun and moon travel together, there lived a king who was beloved by his subjects. With the birth of his first son, there was much rejoicing in the kingdom. ...rejoicing in the kingdom. The elders... The elders came... ...came to present themselves to the king and to give their giftof prophecy to the small child. ...to the small child. One of the elders... One of the elders... ...was as small as a thumb. ...was as small as a thumb. Everyone ignored him. Everyone ignored him. The small man... The small man wrapped his long gray beard... ...long, gray beard around his head three times. "Keep this child away from the man who smells like almonds. "Then, leave them... Hello? Listen, Barrington. You worry too much. You made a perfect choice. She's a good subject. And she's following our precise directions. So... Everything is good. Does that mean I get to keep my finger? Are you sure you covered all your tracks? The Japanese girl could be a problem. I... I was very careful. Something smells in here. Hey, you smell anything? No, I don't. Like what? Oh, I do. Almonds. I smell almonds. Where did you get this? Where did I get this? Can I help you? Help me? Yes. Maybe you can help me, if you give back what doesn't belong to you. What doesn't belong to me? The almonds. Almonds? Poison! What poison? You don't get it. I don't get it! Do you get it? Yes, I get it. I have the key. Let's talk later. I don't know what happened to me. What happened to you? I don't know, the alarm clock rang for three hours and I slept through it. Nothing like that ever happened to me before. Maybe I need two alarm clocks. Why is it so dark in here? Are you the boss? Yeah. But I don't think Nicole has time for another translating job at the moment. It's not about a translating job. I don't know what she wants. She was waiting for you. What's that? This is a job I need to be done. Oh? Do you, uh... have an account with us? No. But I can leave a deposit. Cash? Cash. All right, I'll give you a receipt. Listen, I can't talk here. Can you meet late? Yeah, where? We'll go all the way east, to the river. Number seven? On the rooftop. Okay. What's your name? Ecco. Ecco. Ecco? Ecco Ecco. Ecco Ecco? Yes! Let me go. Honey, can I call you back? I'll, I'll call you right back. Yes, officer? Can I help you? Yeah. Is this your receipt? Yeah, that's our receipt. Listen, could you speak up a little bit louder? I can hardly hear you in here, it's so fucking noisy in here. I have a sore throat. Don't strain yourself. Took this from the pocket of a young Oriental girl. You know her? Oriental girl? Very attractive? Yeah, she was in here, she was in here. You know her name? No, I don't know her name. She was just a customer off the street. Did she pay for this with a check? Check? No, she paid... cash. It's fine for you, it's not so good for us. What's going on? She's dead. Are you kidding? I mean, she was... she was very young. Yeah, she was mutilated. A part of her body was missing. Really? Two fingers were found three feet away from the body. Yeah, but how did she die? She was strangled. With her own hair. Strangled with her own hair? That's pretty bizarre. Well, listen, officer, I wish I could help you, but... I really don't know anything, you know? Well, if you think of anything, let us, uh, know at the precinct. Sure. Everything she had forgotten, everything she had lost sight of... suddenly flowed back into her heart. ...flowed back into her heart. And the spell was broken. It's healed! It's healed. It's healed. Ecco? Ecco... Ecco. Help me. I'm going up. No, no, I'm going down. Ah, it's you! We're in the same office building! Where's the manuscript? We told you to never let it out of your sight. It's in the office. It's safe there. What are you doing? Following me? Don't follow me. Leave me alone! In a faraway land, where the sun and moon travel together... there lived a king... who was beloved by his subjects. Traitor, beware. Traitor, beware. Oh, well, you know, some people spend a lot of money to look like that. Oh, yeah, looks real good with a ponyta... It's okay. Don't be so upset, it's all right. Aw, it's okay. I mean, you have a beautifully shaved head. I'm bald! Bald! It was the last perm that did it to me. I should sue! Oh, shit! I'm going to have to hide until it all grows back. Will it grow back? What if my hair never grows back? Why did you say that? Oh, Nicky, what if... Don't even... -Don't even think that! -Oh, no! Don't even think it! Of course, it's going to grow back. It's all going to grow back. It's going to grow back really, really soon. Why would you think that? You... You should just go to the beach in the meantime. It'll be fun, you'll see. Oh, but everybody I know is at the beach. Well, everyone you know is at the Hamptons. Why don't you go to Atlantic City? That way you can... gamble if you don't want to sit in the sun. I don't have enough money to gamble. I'll give you money! Oh, yeah? How much will you give me? Well, you've got to take Jimmy, so... I'll give you... Two hundred dollars? And that should be enough for... for food and gas and a hotel for a few days. And what if I have to take Jimmy? I need at least 300 dollars. Okay. -Yeah? -When do you want to go? Well, I'm ready to leave now. Great. Oh, good. All right, let me go wake up Jimmy. Okay. -Oh, Nicky. -Yeah? Do you... maybe know of a witch doctor who could make my hair grow back overnight? Witch doctor? Maybe. -Mommy, mommy! -What? What? What's wrong? Mommy, mommy! What? I'm right here. -Mommy, mommy! -What is it, Jimmy? Did you have a bad dream? A ghost was sitting on my chest and I couldn't breathe. It's okay. It's all right. Listen, you want to go to the beach tonight? Isabelle's going to drive down there, you want to go? Are you coming, too? No, I have to stay here and work. But it'll be fun. You won't even have to deal with Isabelle. She's just going to go gambling all night. And then she'll sleep all day anyway. You can just go to the beach, and... hang out with the other kids and stuff. And play in the pool. You've never stayed in a hotel before. You're going to really like it. Okay? God, it's... dust! Why are we at Chinatown? Because we're looking for a Chinese herbalist. I'm sleepy. So, go to sleep. The poison. The animals. I have the key. The poison. The animals. Hang up, Barrington. Hang up. It doesn't matter now. It doesn't matter now. It does matter, Doctor. It's with the snakes. Oh, no! Someone stole my car, did you see him? A kid is asleep in the back seat! Do you have a telephone? Telephone! What are you doing here? What's wrong? Oh, Nicky. Something terrible's happened. What? Someone took the car. I don't understand. Where's Jimmy? Jimmy was in the back seat, asleep. And he was kidnapped. I tried to call you. Somebody took Jimmy? Oh, hey, what's up? You got me a new car again? She's a cutie, huh? Hey, man, what're you doing? I don't want to have anything to do with that. What's the matter with the car? Yeah, nothing is wrong with the car. I don't deal with kids. You know, I don't want to have anything to do with no missing children. What are you talking about? Look over here. What is that in the back seat, a pumpkin? Oh, shit. What am I going to do? Yeah, what, do you think I'm stupid? Get this fucking car out of here! Look, uh... I'll get rid of the kid and bring back the car. No, man, don't bring the car back. Don't you come back. Don't come back with a car, or whatever. Get in the car and split. -Uh... -Get in the car and split. Look, look, I bring you a lot of cars, -right? -Gregory! -Listen, uh... -Yeah, yeah. Get in the car and split. Anything the matter, babe? No, we got it under control here. Bringing a fucking kid! Well, did you call the police? I can't call the police. I'm an illegal alien, I'll get deported. You know I don't have any papers for the car, I don't have registration and I don't have insurance. And I don't have any hair. I can't go to the police. I'm so sorry. Can you ever forgive me? I don't come from this place. I'm from a small town. A factory town. Kind of a nice factory town. Every summer, we had baseball games. My old man would take me if he wasn't too drunk. The guys from the asbestos plant played the guys from the steel foundry. The guys from the steel foundry always won. My old man took me to see two movies when I was a kid. The Wizard of Oz andMoby Dick. What am I going to do with you? Jimmy! Jimmy! So, what's the number? It's 349-7089. Are you sure it's 349-7089? It's... yeah! It's 349-7098. That's not what you said. I'm sure! It's 349-7098. Yeah! It's 349-7098. Yeah, that's it! Jimmy! Hey! Leave that alone. Wait a minute. Come here. Come here. Stop. Step up. Step your other foot up. Okay, one more step. Here you go, turn around, sit here. Listen, I have to go. -Okay? -Don't leave me alone. It's okay, it's okay. Just sit here. Don't move. I don't want you to get hurt.
