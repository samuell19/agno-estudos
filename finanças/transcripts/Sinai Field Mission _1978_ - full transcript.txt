(man speaks foreign language) - Two trucks have gone to Alpha. Two of them, okay. Okay. (man speaks foreign language) - There's one broken truck and they... They hit the TBR. - Okay, so they... - Three, three trucks go to TBR and that one. - Right, okay, so four trucks left E1. There was a broken down truck here. They picked up the broken down truck so three Egyptian trucks have gone to checkpoint Alpha, and then you have one UN Jeep with them. - Yeah, yeah, one UN jeep. - Okay, fine, I just wanted to tell my station, so for their sensors that they would know how many, that their track on the sensors would be the same as the number of vehicles so they can tell. Okay, real fine, thanks very much, appreciate it. They have just left another... One of those two GOE trucks down here, disabled, so it will be abandoned in the buffer zone, so they're heading off now and will probably be in your sensor field in about five or 10 minutes, over. - [Man Over Radio] Okay, so they're gonna leave that one disabled truck there and continue on as one, one, and one. - [Man] That's correct, and that's what they're doing right now, this is three-four clear, thanks for your patience, over. - [Man Over Radio] Thank you three-four Elmo. Clear, break, radio, Alamo. (numbers beep) (man speaks indistinctly over radio) - [Man] Okay, so we've got four vehicles and two hits, right? - I think it's that. (man speaks indistinctly over radio) - [Man Over Radio] Your attention please, your attention please, will the watch officer, the watch officer, call operations, thank you. (helicopter approaches) Your attention please. Mr. Roberts please call 205, Mr. Roberts, please call 205, thank you. Your attention please, Gary Blankenchip, Gary Blankenchip, please call 206, operations, thank you. (machines beep) - [Woman Over PA] Dave Cardy, call 236, Dave Cardy call 236. - The Sinai agreement arranges for an empty zone called a buffer zone between the two sides so that there isn't any physical contact and the possibility of accidents or misunderstandings occurring, on either side are limited force zones which phase out the... Military power that is... Close to the other side. And on either side of these are missile free zones so that the... Sides, so that the frontier itself is created to keep the two sides apart and to diminish the amount of military force that is close and can... Be used to intimidate or to confront the other side. In order that this works, the agreement allowed both sides the many opportunities and ways of checking that these agreements were kept by aerial reconnaissance and by stations on the ground. The United Nations was given the overall responsibility for ensuring that the buffer zone was empty and for checking on the limited force zones and seeing that the... Armaments allowed there, 75 tanks, 8000 personnel, eight battalions, were in fact respected. The Sinai field mission, the American part of this arrangement, was asked to watch over the little central area here in the desert highland, the Mitla and Gidde passes to see that there were no threatening approaches to this area and to report if there were or if anybody actually reached this area. Secondly, the Americans were asked to watch the operations of the two surveillance sights and report on whether or not these were operating as agreed in the Sinai two arrangement. The Sinai field mission has three watch stations, one on an escarpment as far east as possible called the Gidde east watch station. Another one here at this end of the Mitla pass as far east as possible called the Mitla station and then over here, a Mitla was station on another high escarpment overlooking all the central flat sandy area of the canal area, the limited force area and the buffer zone. These watch stations have the function of... Viewing the road accesses in the passes and... Picking up electronically any alert signals from monitoring sensors which are placed along the road. Each of these watch stations is fed in signals on sensors which are placed along the road, on sensors which may be in wadis on the edge to cover other kinds of access to the area and they in turn feed that information back to the central camp. The Sinai field mission is on top of an escarpment about 2000 feet high, next to it over here is an Israeli surveillance station, permitted under the agreement, to look out over all the Suez area, the buffer zone and the limited force zone. On another escarpment, looking east toward the central Sinai desert, towards the area in which Israel has its military forces, is an Egyptian surveillance site. Each of these two surveillance sites are about three kilometers long, each party to the agreement, Israel and Egypt have built up the equipment which they wish to have to both visually... Watch the... Countryside as well as electronic equipment to monitor whatever activity they can. There are actually two passes through which all traffic would have to go and the advantage is not just that these are two bottlenecks but that once you get out in here, there are lots of wadis and places already pre-prepared that you could put tanks and so that you could prepare for an attack and move through here, or if you had moved forces in here, you could hold them here and push them through so this is known early as the strategic Mitla Gidde pass area and the United States has responsibility within the overall buffer zone system for this little area in here. So that the... Both the Egyptian, the American and the Israelis all have installations in somewhat of a horseshoe surrounding the strategic area between these two passes, the Mitla Gidde passes so that each side is on high ground able to look out and to use electronic equipment to monitor the activities going on beyond the immediate frontiers of the buffer zone and the limited force zones. The United Nations has responsibility for the buffer zone and the limited force zone. When the two sides were coming to this agreement about how the frontier would be organized, there was great sensitivity about these strategic passes and the US was asked if it would monitor the same way the United Nations is monitoring the whole agreement, if we would monitor that little bit of it, so we have only two very specific responsibilities under the agreement. One is to monitor movement toward or into the... Gidde and Mitla passes from either side and our second responsibility is to see that the two surveillance stations, E1 and J1 function as they should. And the agreement says that those intelligence stations may collect all the intelligence and they may watch as they wish but they should in no way have a military capability, so it was specified they could have no more than 250 people, that they could only have light arms up to light machine guns, and they could only have 18 vehicles. In other words, they couldn't become a staging point. So the US is tasked with seeing that this is respected and for that purpose, we have... A liaison officer whose 24 hours a day duty right at the entry of each one of the two stations. We have a little... Guard shack and... Your guard shack is on the other side and the two get very close but every vehicle that goes in and every vehicle that comes out is checked to see that this agreement is honored, that is that there are no weapons on it. The Sinai field mission itself is composed of 163 people, we are 23 US government types, and 140 E-systems people, contract people, E-Systems is a Texas corporation under contract to the US government to man the... Sinai field mission here. We both have what you might call substantive responsibilities. The United States officers are state department aid and uses people, diplomats in effect and... We have the responsibility for the overall management and also for the verification or if you want to say the monitoring of the conduct of the E1 and J1 stations. The E-Systems people, the contract people are responsible for the operation of the other part of our responsibility, which is the monitoring of the Gidde Mitla passes. So the E-Systems people are monitoring the sensor fields. The US government is verifying the operation of the E1 J1 in terms of officers and the US government provides the overall management. E-Systems also provides the... Operational needs of the camp, that is the supply and the maintenance and... The vehicles. And it's done under a contract and the total operation, the total cost of the Sinai field mission this year is going to be about 11.2 million dollars. - My impression is that the usefulness of the early warning system is not so much in case of a real attack but maybe it can be more useful to discover that kind of extra activity which probably precedes a large scale military operation. Is this right or not? - I think you're basically right, but our conversation is focused fairly narrowly on what we do here recently, in SFM and we're talking about how we handle it, but you must remember it that the overall buffer system here, the Sinai two agreement, set up as as I was describing this sophisticated concept of buffer zone, limited force, missile free zone and then the machinery so that there was a 60,000 foot reconnaissance flight, a 30,000 foot reconnaissance flight and the two stations so you would generally expect that the two sides would pick up information on any large scale movement that was happening outside this system and that was why I said I think fundamentally, that was very sound, it's better and I think it satisfies both parties if they can verify what is happening on the other side in the other person's territory themselves rather than rely wholly on a third party. So we are supplementary to your capability and Egypt's capability of looking further back. We were given a limited, what was called a tactical role. I think perhaps the easiest way to think of our role is to think of it in terms of a referee. Whereas the analogy isn't exact. You could think of a referee in either in a game such as football, boxing or tennis, and the referee has to make a call, it's their rules, the two parties who are in conflict understand what the rules are, but somebody has to see that... The rules are obeyed and furthermore that any infractions are called and that the action stops and starts over again. Well, it's a bit like that. In this case, the United Nations and the United States are in this referee role. We do not have power, the United Nations carries arms but it is for self defense, we have none at all so our authority is simply that both sides have agreed on the terms of reference and they've asked us as third parties to see that these are observed, so we make, in a sense, referee calls. This is a violation, that is not a violation and these are matters of public record. We filed them directly with the two parties and the United Nations of Washington and the United Nation informs them through their chain of command to the two parties and ultimately to United Nations headquarters in New York. You also have to make hard calls, you have to make them fairly fast and you... And sometimes they're difficult ones. The agreement consists of an agreement, protocol, a US proposal, and an annex and even these four documents in no way spell out all the exact little details that come up as to what happens, what should be done. So basically, the US and the UN have to continue to... Build the details, operational details of the peacekeeping system and you do it like a strong referee and... I believe that you have to make the quick calls and the hard ones and to be assertive and to protect the system because it ultimately creates... Credibility in the referee and in the system which is what we're trying to do, basically, we're trying to increase the confidence of the two parties that the frontier and the agreement are respected. - Good morning, this is John Hicks, the watch officer at SFM. With whom am I speaking? Jeffrey. Ah. Jeffrey, we have been informed by our people at our Gidde east watch station of explosions that are about, that are between 50 and 100 meters... From UN marker, barrel marker 272. And they tell us that it is not artillery, that they are explosions, blasts. And we have no... Knowledge of that, do you know anything about that? Well, we have... Indications that there will be continuous small arms and continuous artillery, but neither of them... Intermittent, I'm sorry, but... Neither say anything about explosions. Okay, now, and also the message that we have... On artillery indicates that it will be a considerable distance from the buffer zone. I see, so it will be all through the area of checkpoint Charlie, eh? Explosions, firings, artillery, everything, okay. - There's just two of 'em, right? One's the small arms and one's the artillery? - Yeah, will you check and see if Gidde is picking up those explosions, I can hear 'em from here. (man speaks indistinctly over radio) Okay, thank you. (PA beeps) - [Man Over PA] Bob Hare, Bob Hare, please call 201. (dog yips) - Detonations or explosions reported by Gidde watch station coming from a northerly direction, north of Gidde... East. - Right, here. - Yes, and the IDF. The Israeli officers said there was about 10 kilometers north. Up in this area. And they would continue for the remainder of today. All day, they will be able to hear the explosions. - Okay. - [Man] Artillery practice or mortar... Explosions. - Heavy explosions. - Right. - It is out of the limited force zone in Israeli held territory. (man speaks Arabic) Could you sign a copy of that for me? Okay. (dog barks) (men speak Arabic) - I have three in this one. - Four, four. - 16 and five, okay, we can release 'em. - Okay. (men speak Arabic) - Okay, let's check their figures, starting from the morning. - The morning. - Nine vehicles, 162 persons. - Okay, okay. - First convoy out, 7:45. - Out. - What do you have? - Six people, two vehicles. - So then the total is seven, 156. - Okay, that's good, then. - Then one convoy in. - Huh? - One vehicle in. - Which part? - Now where have you got this? You've got to take it step by step, go back again, take it each one, you can't jump to this figure. Go back again. - Mmhm. - Write down, nine and 162. - Okay. - Okay, then subtract two vehicles. - Two vehicles with six people. - Right, what does that give? - Seven vehicles, 156. - Okay, now we had one vehicle come in and one person, add that. - Add it. - Add it here. Add it to this so that you have the totals running. Okay, and what are the totals? - 7518. - Wait, 75, what, 757. - 157. - Okay, have you got that? - Mmhmm. - Now going out. - Mmhmm. - One vehicle, three persons. - Coming in. - [Man] No, going out. They went out to pick up that vehicle. - Mmhmm. - So subtract one vehicle and three persons. - One for four. - Okay, now two vehicles came in. - Two. - And... - Three. - Three people, now add those. - 751. - 751, how can-- - 157. - [Man] Okay, 157, okay. Do you agree with that? - Yeah. - Okay, but before you said we had 159 persons. Now you say, do you agree that this is correct, 157? Okay. You agree, nine vehicles, 157 persons. Okay, good, okay, we have to keep, we have to agree on our numbers here, otherwise, there's a difference that has to be adjusted, but when we've figured it out so you agree, then it's okay. (man pants) (country music) - How many you got there? - Because we've got two in the front and I've got six back here, so I've got eight. - That's got eight, yes, obviously. - And we've got one in the first truck and the canteen so altogether... - That's nine. - Yeah, but here we've got six and two for eight, one, nine, they told us you were gonna have eight. Okay, so they were wrong again. - Wrong again. So we'll correct it, you inform them, won't you? - Okay, so we have 10 and 202. - Yeah. - And they say that we've got 10 and 201. (bell rings) (dog barks) - I'm John Rose and I'm the post security officer here at SFM, what we have here is a videotape of the... Of an explanation of the display panels for the... Electronic security system and the first part of the tape is in English and then it is one of the Ghanaian languages. - [Tape] Gentlemen, let's first take a look. There's an intruder, a search, the alarm system comes on automatically on your boat. Let's first listen to what happens when the boat comes into only one sector of your area of observation. (alarm beeps) As soon as anything comes within your area of observation this is for opening number three. What you see is that... Two lights will come on this area, on the line's area of observation. When you are the OPC, the only thing you have to do is to inform the control, who will be in the guard room at the SFM main base that you have seen these lights on your board, so all that you have to do is to press the alarm acknowledged. Now I will try and speak, tell you what I've said so far in English in one of the main Ghanaian languages, which is Tree. (man speaks Ghanaian) - The IDF has expanded their foreign exercise from 11 to, they called me at about 11:15, I put out a message on 'em. Now on the reccy flight, they did have two reccy flights scheduled during this time, both to fly the median line, two aircraft each, but they were not on the median line. They were not even in the buffer zone. - [Man] One was, the one I went out and saw was, definitely in the buffer zone. - Okay, okay. - Now what they sometimes do is they fly a cover plane who flies outside, near... In a proximate vicinity of the one that's flying the median line and that's what I assume they had. - That's what they did because Alamo reported on their size of the aircraft they spotted, flew entirely east of their position, which would have been east of that. - That's true, but the first one, the one that made the sonic boom, I went outside and it was going right over this, right, the same way they always do. - [Man] Okay, that's the one George Flores saw, because the one Don and I... - It's so high you can't tell if it's one or two aircraft, I assume it's two. - I see, Don and I saw a different con trail and that was going north South. - [Man] That's probably the cover craft. - East of us, and that would have been the one that Alamo saw, okay, we're fine, thanks. - There was another story about two weeks ago with a bus, in J1. That... Bus was coming, was trying to get out of J1, there was no UN escort, the UN came all the way from the second, the UN came about two minutes after the priority time and then you checked in the gate, didn't let him out and this is ridiculous. Because we can't plan on two minutes' business. - [American] Well, we're going to. - No, no, no. - We can't, no. - If we are delayed in two minutes, I will not accept a no as an answer. Unless there is a purpose behind it. - [American] Well, you cut me off before I gave you a purpose. If we have to set a cut off time... Then we're gonna abide by it. - If it's a daily problem, I understand, but if it's once in a blue moon, it's... - It's a decision that will be made by the senior officer. - [Israeli] And especially, especially if we were on time and it's the UN, it's the communication between the SFM and UN... - No, it's not a communication between the SFM and UN. - Oh, it is, oh it is. - No, it is not. - Oh, it is. - Because the communication has to be between you and the UN, we don't... - We don't need permission from the SFM to go into the buffer zone. - [American] You need permission to go out of the gate. - Right you are, so we would have taken the bus 10 minutes before out of the gate and wait in the buffer zone for the escort. - [American] But you would have been in violation. - This is between us and the UN, not between us and the SFM, your authority starts and ends at the gate. - [American] That's correct. - Now if we're timing the gate, we're allowed to go out to the buffer zone. - [American] No, our instructions are that you're not to go into the buffer zone without an escort. - This is between you and the UN, this is an agreement between you and the UN. And that's the reason I said this is between the SFM and the UN, and if it's a problem between the SFM and the UN, there is no reason why we should suffer and this time it was between you and the SFM, I just took you around the circle to show you that this is between you and the SFM, and the UN. If you cooperate and have got an agreement with the UN, which is none of my business, that you are keeping an eye on the Israelis, that they won't get from J1 into the buffer zone without a UN escort, it's not between me and the UN, it's between you and the UN, because again, your authority starts and ends at the gate. - Okay, you're talking apples and oranges. - No, I wanted to show you, I wanted to show you to give you this example. That we can't play... The game one side, in two minutes' delay. We were not delayed, the UN was delayed. - [American] All right, but that is between you and the UN. - Yes, but not getting out of J1 into the buffer zone, it's between you and the UN. - All right, if it is... Passed, this I assume was at the very end of the day. - It doesn't matter, but we were there on time. We are not... We have coordinated an escort. The UN have technical problems. According to the agreement between you and the UN, we couldn't leave the gate. - But I-- - Because otherwise we could have left the gate. Oh, it was the last convoy. The arguments are always about the last convoy. - All right. - The problems are before the last one. What I am trying to say is that we can't work on exceptionals on two minutes timetable, especially if we are not delayed. Now you volunteered to control the buffer zone for the UN. What's the gun platoon is doing up there? It's their job to avoid our entrance to the buffer zone from J1, it's not your job, but... It was coordinated like that between, I don't know, Mr. Thorn and (speaks Israeli) or someone else that you will tell them, you wouldn't open the gate if there is no escort, so this is between you and the UN, not between us and the UN. - Well. The... There is... There are two... Operating procedures, neither, actually, if we've got a problem, you and I aren't gonna solve it, it'll be between the senior officer here and Colonel Levinson. - Oh, you are wrong. - No, I'm sorry, if we get into a basic problem on... - The problems will be solved between the senior officer here and Colonel Levinson are political and principle. Problems. - If we're getting into a discussion of whether or not... The UN's standing operating procedure. - No, no, no, no. - And our standing operating procedure are... - No, no, it's not your... - Are in violation of... The understanding with the Israeli government then this is beyond my level, it's beyond your level. - But we're not talking about violating the understanding with the Israeli government. We are discussing now... The unflexibility of one exceptional problem by the SFM, that's all, because we'll start playing the same game, life will be very difficult here. - If we're talking about whether or not the standing operating procedure is the correct procedure or incorrect procedure or whatever or... - I'm not criticizing your procedure. The only thing that I am trying to tell you and to ask you what happened to the flexibility, I mean, the 10 minutes flexibility in this area. Maybe you have... - I don't know that there ever was one, but I'm going to look into the thing and find out all about the exact time and... - It's not only this problem. I think that we can't work in stiff frame when you are dealing with people, especially on matters like that. I am talking about human beings. - Yeah. - [Israeli] Not about papers and frames, and that's the way I want to be treated. - Well, that's what we're trying to do, as far as I know. - I took the matter of the bus as an example because it's the last one and usually the arguments are about the last one or the one before the last. (faint classical music) - Well, that's beautiful, could you show me how to work that thing? - Sure. - Because I want to use that next time. - This list tells us... Where every person is. Each day. And the days are all marked, of course, at the top. They're broken out by month. If you go down here in order, you can tell by coding system where the person is actually located and for what reason they'd be out of base camp. - Where's the coding system? - Well, each day the departments turn in to us a sheet that tells us at certain hours during the day where a person is going to be located, if they're gonna be out of base camp. - Right. - And we list the codes up here at the top. We go from one to 15 explanations why somebody could be out of base camp, so you can work out your billing and see whether we need to pay these people or whether they owe us money or whether they're playing. - My problems are not on the money angle, mine are the ones that I can't trace down to money. We've got records of everybody who's got any money, did you see these people are going overnight don't get any money so there's no record of it. My records, I had to go around and get them individually, but I found out about this file, that's great. - Next time, you need to use it, you're welcome to it. - Oh, don't worry, I'll find it next time. - All right. Okay. - 15, 20, 50, 70, 90, 100. - What do you think? Regular evening? - Yep, see you later. - That article Sunday night about what was it, 260 refugees outside of Singapore there? And that ship that's just about ready to sink. The, what, six nations have come to their assistance. One of them's the United States, of course, with the UN, and they're gonna try and farm 'em out, take 'em out of there and send 'em to some country that will accept 'em. - That'd be interesting to know. Where those people came from. - Yeah. Yeah, we got a lot of Laotians and mountain yards in California, did you know that? - Any communications with them? Having communications with the mountains? - Well, we got our former maid visiting with us for two weeks now, she lives in Hawaii and... She came to California about a week ago. She's staying with my wife now, she's really enjoying her stay, now she's talking about staying. She might stay, and... My wife's looking around to see what's available as far as, you know, work for a woman her age, you know, she's a cook, maid, so... Might come up with something, but she's having a little problem acclimatizing herself because she's from Canto, which is down in the delta, which is, you know, temperatures down there. (machine clicks) - Something that I think we need to re-instill in the people as well as all of us... The orders for our people come from each of you and from Garrett and myself. If there are instances where... State department people have... Gone directly to various groups and said, do this or... Requested some particular action or directed some function be done, you should inform your people that they are to tell whomever has issued this direction, whether it be Thorn or whoever it might be, to contact his manager or the program manager, because they take their directions from us. I don't want to push this to the point where we're being uncooperative, but I think it's... There are situations that arise that I don't think we should expect the people... In the trenches, so to speak, to have to make a decision that may affect other parts of the mission. I know we've had occasions where they've gone directly to the guard force and asked them to do something in particular. They've gone in maintenance and directed this, that and the other be done. So, we just need to... Make sure all our people get the word, whenever there's some question or an instance like that occurs, that they should direct the... Questioning or direct the State Department to their immediate supervisor and then on up the line. The security question revolving around a reaction force or merely a guard force, if you can make those distinctions in your mind. It appears now that Washington is leaning... More towards a... Our philosophy from the beginning, that the... Physical security of the base camp is the responsibility of the United Nations here in the buffer zone and more particularly in combat.

The idea of introducing something like this into a process where... You keep a peace plan... Or keep the peace... Is really not new. Because the UN has been doing something very similar for a number of years. The idea of using... People from just one country to do this is new. When I was first told that we were gonna set this mission up everybody said it wouldn't work. For one thing, they said there wouldn't be enough time to set it up and there's still two or three people like Ed Bloom and Ken Ridaround who remember the 22nd of January last year, that we had exactly one month left to start this mission and to perform this task, actually, the camp was built in 19 days, and the entire system was ready to go on the 17th of February, five days ahead of schedule. Since that time I've watched a lot of people come and go. Some people couldn't take the climate. Some people couldn't take the isolation. Some people couldn't take the repetitive nature of the duties, but as time has gone on, I've watched the E-Systems group and the US government group grow closer together until the lines between the two are really not distinct anymore. There were times when we had to have staff meetings every day because we had that many problems. We haven't had a staff meeting in three months. We haven't needed to have one because the problems that exist don't have to be solved by people at the management level, they're solved by people who work with each other and there is no need to sit down and discuss them. President Carter has said that he thinks that future peacekeeping measures and ceasefire-keeping measures require this sort of a mission. President Sudan of Egypt has said it, the new prime minister of Israel has said it. And there will be more of them. So you've actually participated in three things. You've participated in the first experiment by the United States in sending a group of unarmed people out, putting them between two hostile armies, to help keep the peace and it's been successful. You have... For the first time represented our country in a peacekeeping role where the US has always in the past chosen not to do so by itself. And finally, you have proven that a new dimension in international relations, a new dimension in diplomacy, is not only possible, but can be successful. I hope very much that in the future, I'll get to see all of you again and if I don't, I want to thank you all very much for what you've done and to wish you the best of luck in the future. (drum music) (game beeps) (belly dance music) - Tough stuff, tough. - Rough. (men speak indistinctly) - [Man] Three aces. Got a lock. (cards snap) - [Man] 100. - Call, call. (cards snap) - [Man] Cut to call, that's the best I can do. - [Man] He's hot, he's hot, he's hot. - Feels good. - Here we come. - I enjoy it a great deal. - [Man] You stay drunk all the time? - In Cairo, you better believe I stay drunk. (man laughs) - Gary, let me have a beer, get over here. - Good to see you, and you brought a friend. - Well, I'm glad you guys have a good time. - Oh, we have a crazy time. - Well, I think everybody will wanna go over there. - [Man] When you are in this country, you have got to make Cairo, you've got to make Egypt one time, whether you like or dislike it, you've got to make it. - It's all right, we'll see it, take some pictures. We saw it all, cross the Nile, see the pyramids. - [Man] The female aspect is not there. - Right. - But it's worth seeing, worth spending five, six cases on. Hello, Glen, let me see you work your fingers! - That's how they do it. - These waiters in Cairo. I'm gonna cut your hands off. - I told Chris a joke last night that really applies to him as an old man, seeing that restaurant, he's real old, you know. - Come here, Aggie. - Uh-huh. - I don't know if I can tell it now. (men laugh) - [Man] Now you're in the middle of a joke. Step out, Aggie. - Oh, no, I've got to have my happy hour drink. - [Man] Go ahead, she don't have virgin ears. - Isn't that the truth? - There's a racket coming from this room and this nurse walks into the room and there's this guy beating both hands on the wall, you know, just raising all sorts of hell, she says, you know, Mr. Smith you're too old for that kind of funny business, what's wrong? He goes, it's the first time in 18 years I've had an erection and both hands are asleep. (everyone laughs) - He was in trouble. - Lots of ice. - Told that to him and his face just turned red as a beet. (man laughs) - He only has one once a year, says tonight's the night. - [Man] That's right, big ole grin on his face. Did it hurt? - I don't know. (men laugh) - [Man] How are you managing to drink those screwdrivers with grapefruit juice? - I think everything'll work out for the best. You stay in contact with us or have someone let us know something. - Yeah, I gave my address to several people here. Dave has it. - Dick has it. - I think Dick has it, he should have it. - Keep us informed what's going on. - I'll write a letter. - Sure, but not til you're home. You write one letter here today, we'll take it around, then everybody'll write, as long as it's helpful, it's best to go. (man speaks indistinctly) Go ahead and get it taken care of and see what's happening. Well, I hope their diagnosis is wrong. - Well, if it ain't, it's something I already accepted. I already accepted it. (light rock music) - Come here one second. - Come on, baby, tell me true, am I the one, the one for you? (men laugh) If I'm not, oh let me go. But if I am, well, let me know.

We call on our Lord to bless us by his special presence this morning, we come in here on our own deliberately and freely, we mean by that to say that we have a place for him in our lives that only he can have. We are very conscious, I think most of us, that we're pretty much alone when you get out in these circumstances and that loneness has its benefits too because it really brings out the point that we are never really completely alone. He is always present to us. The difficulty is that we are not present enough to him, that's the problem, and so we do these things to help ourselves to be present to God so that he can do things for us that he couldn't otherwise do and this is where we begin. We try to say to the Lord, Lord, you know me better than I know myself. But at the same time, if I say things, you can do something for me, and so we begin by telling him very plainly, we know we're stinkeroos. We are no gooders, we're absolutely bums of ourselves, but thanks to him we have hope. The solitary-ness of our life comes over us, even in the best of circumstances, when everything is just rosy, we can find that we're still very much alone on what we can do, what we can't do. That applies to great men, too, and so they have their moments and all of have them. It shouldn't bother us, we want to keep going. That applies to married life, family life, social life, political life, all those... Variations, where... We can get tangled up easily, but if we know, I am a... One man and I have it in me to be able to do this and this is my goal and I take me as I am to be what I can be with God's help and then leave the rest to a lot of others, God particularly, that we can just say, well, here, I am, here I am, this is I, and if it goes, fine, it doesn't go, hmm, no problem am I, and if I have that about me, I can easily help others to have the same, just be myself, then I can be that way with others, they call it acceptance, I think, that's a common term. Self acceptance and the acceptance of others. Each one, no matter who it is, child or grownup, rich or poor, talented or not talented, each one is someone. So we say, we call out to him, very simply, the way the book has it, we call for his mercy, and we say, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy. Christ have mercy, Christ have mercy. (group joins in) Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy. (man pants) (woman laughs) (men exclaim) (men clap) - Right here baby, right here. - All right! - There you go. (men exclaim) - [Man] Hold up, hold up, hold up, take your time. (machines clank) (man pants) (steam hisses) (PA beeps) - [Man Over PA] Your attention please, Mike Einick, please call 207. - [Man Over Radio] They have a Ghana combat escort standing by, it was evidently, there was a request made by someone here and the only thing he could tell us was that he was there to escort the boss man, what do you think about that? - Don, I'll call the... The gate myself and see what he's doing, thank you. Hey, Rogers, this is Forest at the watch office. You have a Ghanaian escort over there? What did he have to say? The boss man. Uh-huh. No, I don't think we need him, but hold on a minute. Let me see if somebody else has called for an escort. Hold on, please. - Watch your head. You're allowed to arrive here, at the top, we'll turn toward Mecca. - Oh, is this Mecca? - That's the direction. The cemetery is right over here, on the hill there and there's quite a few graves just down over the hill there - Are there grave markers? - No, mostly just rock, why don't we take a walk over there, we can... Zip down around here. - We should leave our name here. - This is the old veteran's cemetery. Obviously they buried the dead here when they were stopped en route to Mecca, the smaller ones we assume are children. - This one was a... That's the tallest one. - Paul Bunyan, isn't it? (women laugh) (PA beeps) - [Man Over PA] Your attention please, your attention please Will the watch officer, will the watch officer call the operator? - Hi, Joey? Hi, George Dragnus here, watch officer. We've got a situation, I want to give you advance notification of. We've got a seriously wounded soldier at J1 and the Israelis are going to be flying an emergency helicopter into the camp itself to pick him up. They are in the process of getting UN approval now. I've just talked with UN Bravo, they are going to give them that approval, what we're working on now are the simple administrative details. Would you inform your LO that this will be happening? We will give you formal notification as soon as we hear from the UN Bravo, they are gonna call us. But your Egyptians at E1 may be picking up an Israeli helicopter coming straight for the buffer zone before that time, okay, great, thanks much, George, bye. - Go ahead, Rogers. - [Man Over Radio] Red River, got one GOE truck headed your way with one convoy, two personnel in the truck, over. - One GOE truck with two personnel and one UN convoy, is that correct? - [Man Over Radio] That's correct. (voice drowned out by noise) - Roger, thank you. - Now we're having a med evac at J1 and also that there'll be a gate lift, a helicopter deploying in your vicinity and it should be deploying shortly so you might keep an eye out on it. If they activate sensors, don't forget to send in the usual spot report. This will not be an intrusion, copy, over? - [Man Over Radio] Okay, we just make a regular spot report then, on the helicopter going through. - That's affirmative. That's approved. - Okay. - Paul, I've got quarter horse on the line. - [Paul] Yeah, I wanted him on the line, okay. - Take him on this? - Yeah, I'll take him wherever, hello? John, Bob and Ernie are about to come on down there. The point will be for Ernie to get in wherever this helicopter actually picks up the guy to take him out. Just to do the operation, you know. But this is something that we will have to do. Okay, John, thanks a lot, bye bye. - I called George Flores up at E1 and gave him an advisory to let the Egyptians know what was going on because... - Yeah, Colonel Olly'll be watching that. - Their people are going to be watching. If they see an Israeli helicopter coming straight for the buffer zone, they'll want to know what's going on. And then we'll give them the approval, the notification, we'll give them the notification of approval. We will notify E1 as soon as we hear from the UN. - [Man] Well, all right, yeah, we can let them know what we heard, yeah. - Well, Bob told me explicitly to let E1 know that we can do that. - Yeah. - But I wanted to let them know beforehand since that approval may be held up and that helicopter may be hovering there at the buffer zone ready to enter and E1 hasn't been notified of what's going on. This way, they'll know what the helicopter is doing there. - Yeah. (phone rings) (machine clicks) - Hello, right, this is George Dragnus at the watch office. I understand that the UN has approved it? Excellent, is that all? Okay, very good, thanks, bye. (telephone clicks) Yeah, George, the UN has approved the IDF helicopter flight, the med evac into J1. It's on its way and I'm gonna give you a hard copy. I just wanted to let you know right away, okay, thanks, George. UN's approved it. (machine clicks) - Punch your speaker, talk to the shift supervisor. You give him the message, he puts it on the teletype. That way he is in full knowledge of everything that's going on. - Sure. - Okay? - Sure, meanwhile the guy is bleeding to death, that's fine. - No, all you have to do is to give it to him by voice. - It's much faster if you go in and you do it yourself. He has a copy of it. - Okay, but-- - You know it yourself from having it back in the States. If you have the secretary and you dictate a message to her, it's much faster if you can just sit down and crank it out yourself. - It is, but we were supposed to be working in cooperation with those guys. And they're upset, okay? - Well, fuck 'em, 'cause it's a medical emergency. - I realize that it's a medical emergency, but in this case, you were not getting the guy out. You were simply advising E1 of what's taking place. They already know from the telephone. It does not hurt to be courteous to the guys. I was not talking in terms of all the stuff that is necessary to get the guy out of there. I'm talking about this particular message. - Paul, you're the boss, if I did it wrong, that's fine. I think it's a crock of shit, but I'll do it that way. But let me go on record as saying I think it's a crock of shit. - [Paul] Well, maybe, but the thing is that they like to know what is going on out there. - I gave 'em a copy of it. - I know, but it doesn't hurt. In the least. - Well, if they wouldn't be so sensitive about their egos, nobody in E-Systems worries about bruising USG egos and you know that as well as I. - Well, that's all right. - And they can just be a little thick skinned themselves. - Okay, but in this case, your emergency didn't extend into this particular part because the people had already been advised, you were simply giving confirmation of it. - [Man Over Radio] Two persons evacuated, over. - Two persons evacuated. - Roger, roger. - Roger, will pass that to the watch officer. - [Man Over Radio] Over, clear. - They've evacuated two people. - 16:27. - 16:47. - 16:47, two people, okay, fine, I'll pass that information on over to E1 base. Thank you, appreciate it. (machine beeps) - Yeah? - Yeah, right, I'd like a message sent up to E1 please, to advise them that the IDF helicopter departed J1 at 16:47, no mention about the people, please, just the fact that it departed at 16:47, over. - Okay, George. - Thanks, Joe. - Adrian, George again, have you sent a convoy up? Okay... That's, can you hold on for a second, let us take care of that here? All right, yeah, that's what we have too, just hold on for a second, and I'll get approval, okay? Paul, because of this... Problem, they now have a convoy down in Bravo which will exceed the total up at J1. They will bring the total up to 254. John Rose says that there's 17 people at Bravo waiting to come up. And they don't have an outgoing convoy for 30 minutes. Now they, Adrian... - You mean there won't be an outgoing convoy at the time that the incoming convoy gets there? - Well, yeah, it will because it'll be about 30 minutes from now, at 5:30. - Yeah. - May assures that they've got a whole podfull of people wanting to come out, but we're unable to-- - If John is convinced that it's not gonna run over the limit-- - Well, it will run over the limit when they get there. - Oh, all right, that's after four o'clock. Well, I think given the emergency they've just been through, that's... Let's go ahead and let it in. - I've got Captain Church on the line now. - Yeah, just, since we know that as soon as the situation is created, it'll be corrected. - Right. - Yeah, but tell him to watch it now not to let more people in. - George Dragnus here, yeah, fine, let those people in but don't let any more people in until they bring the number down below 250, okay? (PA beeps) - [Man Over PA] Your attention please, your attention please, Mr. Hunt, Mr. Hunt, please call 201, I say again, Mr. Hunt please call 201, thank you. (engine approaches) (lighter clicks) (PA beeps) - [Man Over PA] May I have your attention please. Charlie Gregory, call the operator, Charlie Gregory, call the operator. - Ed... I'd like you to head up an investigation of... Some broken furniture we had... Saturday night. I believe it was... There was a group of fellas after the bingo game that had a party. And... Sunday morning there was a pile of furniture that looked like the seats had been torn off some of those kitchen chairs. I'd like to find out the details behind it and anybody that was involved in it. And at a minimum, I'd like to see letters of reprimand issued to those people. This is the third time that something has happened, like this, each time it's gotten worse. And each time it's been in the exact location principally by... Some people in the facilities section that I'm not saying they were the ones that did it but it was their party that it happened at. I don't have any idea of any people that were involved. But there were some broken glass and... Some chairs that were damaged, some light bulbs that were broken and just... You know, it's not necessary and we need to get it stopped. - [Man] I agree. - And if... It's gonna be like it was with the sunbathing on the modules, if the people can't respect the furniture and can't conduct themselves properly, then we will ban any outdoor parties, and... We'll just keep picking away at the privileges until they're all locked up, I guess. So I'd like to know what the real story was and... And issue letters of reprimand at a minimum. - Last night I was up in the office area and I heard from somebody that some of the UN troops were eating the late meal in the mess hall, the midnight shell, and by the time I was able to get over there to see who it might be, a group of some feds were leaving the rec hall and getting ready to board their vehicle and leave, but as I went in, I got the impression that there were six of them that were in the cafeteria area and had either picked up some chili or, you know, not a full tray of items but just a few items and I had the impression that this was... Taboo for all the UN troops and just wondered if there's some way we need to notify the feds or get in touch through USG and see that it's stopped. - And we have a sign up there now that states that the midnight meal is SFM personnel only, perhaps we need to jack up our own people here to be sure that's enforced, I'll check on that tonight. - Well, I think maybe it was the feds, the problem might have been the language, you know, there have been situations where I've tried to approach him and there wasn't anyone in the group that was well versed enough in English to really carry on a good conversation, so maybe... Maybe there wasn't any malice in what they did at all. They just didn't know they weren't supposed to do that. - Well, I got back from Cyprus Thursday. While I was over there, I had procured a couple records and I wanted to make some tapes over and Friday and Saturday, it wasn't til way after bingo Saturday night that I was able to get in and use the recording equipment because the UN troops were in there, had it tied up all the time. - [Man] Yeah, I was wondering how far the courtesy extends. - [Man] That's my point, I don't know what the policy is. Have they been extended all these privileges, or is it just for SFM use? (laughs) - They have been allowed to utilize everything in our recreation facility, excluding the meals. Now... - [Man] All the UN people? - However, it has, it's also been policy that... They will not... Their presence will not deny our people the right to use any of those things, it's sort of an if it's available type problem, we have, at the time when this policy decision was made, the hobby shop was not in existence and I think before anybody gets any ideas, I think, you know, maybe we ought to make it perfectly clear to everybody that they will not be allowed in the hobby shop I think that would be kind of a fiasco, not to think we would... Don't mean to be malicious about it, but I don't think that we could stand, you know, 20 or 30 UN people coming in and using the carpentry shop or using the weight room or other things. It's just the equipment is really for our people. - Well, on Saturday, there was three or four people that told me they had tried two or three times during the day and I know I tried. - [Man] There was one man there all day long. - And then after he left there was three more came in that had piles of records. I don't know where they came from, but... Sure was busy this last weekend. - Well, you might check and see if we can get some action taken. You have anything else? - Thank you. - Thank you.

It is a real pleasure for me to be here today with you to again present the United Nations peacekeeping medal to members of the Ghanaian contingent. Realizing the hardships you have to encounter in this difficult terrain, I can only have the greatest admiration for the stamina and the discipline which you have so profoundly shown. We all know that militarily speaking, you are charged with the most sensitive area of the buffer zone. Your splendid cooperation with the Sinai field mission is also a very valuable asset to UNIF. I have to inform you that we are going to face interesting days ahead. I am quite satisfied in that both parties have expressed their sincere wish to find a settlement to this 30 year old issue in this part of the Middle East. With God's blessing, we will come closer to peace in this area. Our duties will have to be taken more seriously, however, so as to avoid any actions or overreactions that might mar our relationship with both parties. On behalf of the Secretary General of the United Nations, may I once again thank you for the service which you have so loyally given in the cause of peace, thank you. - Parade shown! Shoulder height!
