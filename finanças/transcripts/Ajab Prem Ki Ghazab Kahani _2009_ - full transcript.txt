So that nobody comes to know, David gave my name.. lt makes no difference. God has written your name with Jenny. Prem, you should've told her once how much you loved her. l'm sure, she'the have..-Let it be. Let's talk about something else. l couldn't say it to her. So wasn't it love? ls it important to say in love? Hey, what did Chandar use to say? Feelings. Only feelings. Love with dictionary? My feelings too were in vain. Let it be. Let's talk about something else. Rahul is a nice boy. He's from a decent family. He's rich. They talk in English. Pe_ect match. Listen.. ..both are vegetarian. Let it be.

Actually to celebrate your wedding, friend served me. But how come you're here? Where is Rahul? l don't know. He got down at a station to buy books.. ..and then, l don't know. He didn't come back. Where could l've gone? You did good by coming here. But Rahul.. Jenny, can l say something if you don't mind? These rich and spoilt brats are like this only? For them love is a game. Time pass. No, l was iust kidding. l'm sorry. l'll find Rahul anyhow. Don't worry, Jenny. You won't understand. l'll understand. Tell me. You won't understand even if l tell you. Why not? l'm very smart. Why won't l understand? Because you've never loved anyone. How can l tell you why l love you? l can't even if l try. My eyes express the feelings of my heart. You don't realize it. Shooting star! You don't realize it. We couldn't unite even after meeting. God knows why. We are miles apart. God knows why. These are strange circumstances. God knows why. My dreams are woven around you.
