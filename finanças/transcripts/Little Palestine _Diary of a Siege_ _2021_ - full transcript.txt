Abdallah Al-Khatib, I'm defecting from the United Nations. This is my ID card… Abdallah Al-Khatib. that's me. "The bearer of this card whose name appears on the back... …is a staff member of the United Nations. He is entitled to the resources and protection of the United Nations." From 2013 to 2015, the Assad regime besieged a district of Damascus which was called "Yarmouk Camp" and where lived the largest concentration of Palestinian refugees in the world. No one could either enter or leave. Little by little, the camp was deprived of food, water electricity, medicine. Everyone was trying to adapt in their own way. Umm Mahmoud, my mother, volunteered as a nurse to take care of the elderly. Sometimes, my friends and I would take a camera to record the daily life during the siege. The horizon was open to endless possibilities. We walked towards it confidently. Without noticing that something strange was looming. We were happy in the blue sky and the sound of the wind. Suddenly, a heavy dust flooded the space. The colors and the people disappeared. Time stopped beyond the roadblock. And now everything is moving along to the rhythm of the siege. At first we couldn't believe it. But something finally made us realize that the time of peaceful bonfires was gone forever. The - people - want the road to be opened! Out, out, out! Abdallah, get out! Out, out, out! Abdallah, get out! - Who's with me? - Me! For those who are with me… Go get me chocolate. The - people - want shawarma with meat! You’re the only ones on my side? You're all against me? The people wants eggs and milk! Who’s with Abdallah and who’s against him? We're all against him. Ok so you 4… you'll get biscuits. - Who cares… - We’ve got loads of them anyway! How can we convince them to find a solution for the camp? Wait for your turn to speak. They need to find a solution so we get our childhood back. Just re-open the roads! What if they say they don’t want to? Then send us back to Palestine! Bring some airplanes and send us back to Palestine. Nice. Now what were you saying? She thought it was a joke… Qusay and Muaz are coming. - Who do you love? - Muaz! - The king of rats. - Muaz! - Who do you love? - Muaz! - The king of rats. - Muaz! Come here, Muaz! If you were our leader what would you say, Ansam? - What about me? - Later. Ansam. - Yes. - What do you mean, "yes"? I'd say they have to re-open the roads. It’s our right to be able to eat, drink and be safe. That’s my position. What if they say: "We don’t want to deal with the camp." - Well they just have to! - Let them live under siege too! In that case, God will judge them. I’d tell them that at least. - It’s too small! - Any bigger and it’ll burst. - Ok then leave it. - Like this? - Not until it bursts? - No. - What? - Don't make it burst. - It's good like this. - Yes, now it will fly. - Yes. Where to? - To the sky. No, to the swing! - To the swing? - Yes. Out of the way, it’s going to fly! Out of the way. When your mum gets back, give one to Hammoud too. Ok. - Where did she go? - My mother? - Yes. - To the mosque. - Why? - To pray, like "Allahu Akbar". - Abdallah, where's your mother? - Praying in the mosque. Make it fly to the sky. - Why? - To catch it later on. - Catch it? - From the sky. - So I send it flying? - Yes. Fly! Fly! - It burst. - Yes! Blow it up again. I'll tell my mother to give you a new one. Mother! Aisha! Mother! Ok good. Good. We defused the landmines, fixed the bread ovens, and God is with us, right. And when hell freezes over, they’ll re-open the roads. Yes. We’re working bit by bit, trying to keep our cool, for everybody’s sake. Thank you. Yes, of course. They put the delegation on a turtle, it's that slow. We keep praying, some days are better than others. Where are we going? We film there and then see? Today, we only film one of them. Couldn't we film several today? - No, I don't have the time. - Ok. - Ready? - Me? Yes. - Let's go, where should we film? - In the school yard? Good idea, there's a shade there. - Let's go. - We can sit there. I have kept my accent. I'm preserving our… you know… Some change their accent, they speak like Syrians. You wouldn't guess they're Palestinian. After years of living together, some mixing happens. These youngsters mix in schools, at work, they all end up speaking like that. - Exactly. - I couldn't change my accent. What was that? Maybe they’re bombing us. Don't worry. You'll be covered in dust. Use this. No, I’ll use mine. I'll just remove the dust. - So as not to be covered in… - I’ll move it closer. - No, it's fine. - As you wish. I just don’t want you to get dirty. - Didn’t you want to interview me? - We do! I’ll answer according to your questions. - When did you leave Palestine? - Me? In 1948. - How old were you? - About 15. - So you remember? - Of course! - She was a teenager! - When I left, yes. The truth is the Syrian people have been good to us. They embraced us, provided food and water. They'd bring food to our homes, I swear. We never felt humiliated, God forbid! We were never hungry or thirsty, or experienced hardship. But for the last 7 months we've really been suffering. When the air force attacked the camp, people fled. - Did it feel like 1948? - Of course! Those who fled are crazy, I would never leave. They turned away and fled, why? The aircraft bombed and then left. They were unharmed! Why run away? I'm really mad at them. They shouldn’t have left. They should stay, endure, and keep calm. Now the camp is ruined. Destroyed. It's gone. Why didn't you leave? What if you were hit by a shell? Let it hit, my dear! Many have already… - Why didn't you leave? - Our façade collapsed and… Me, leave? Our first wound is not enough for you, dear? I will never leave. They can kill me. - I’ll stay with you. - It’s the right thing to do. - Your family still here? - Only my son here. So he’s your son! God protect him. - Where do you live? - In Yarmouk. Near Jenin Club. - Are you scared of the shelling? - No. Don’t be, bravo. I was living alone already when the shelling happened. I had my children and grandchildren with me. But they… They left during Ramadan, to get food… - and got stuck outside! - My husband too! He’s stuck outside the siege. YOU WILL NOT EXILE US FROM OUR CAMP The siege is as long as a day in prison. Like a railway in the desert on a hot summer day. A path leading to madness or suicide. Under siege, time is the true prison of the besieged. KILLING THE FLOWERS WILL NOT DELAY SPRING Beware. Time kills those who follow it. Leave it alone. Fill the void with meaning as much as you can. Find meaning in a clean road, after the destruction caused by an aircraft. Pick up a broom. Find meaning in a child whose smile withstands the siege. Make a paper plane. Find meaning in details you fear will disappear. Pick up a camera. Find meaning in a fleeting moment of joy one evening. Sing. To the unwavering. To the flag-bearers. To the flag of Palestine, and of Syria. And Yarmouk. And Yalda, Babbila and Beit Sahem. To those present and those absent. To those who came, and those who didn't. To those who applauded, and those who didn't. To the steadfast and the displaced. To the exiled and the imprisoned. To those who love the Prophet, pray for him. "The wheat fields, the wheat fields…" Come in! We are the people of Palestine. The refugees, the wretched. We still celebrate our joyous occasions. Our children’s weddings. Your brother Abu Alaa, born in Palestine, is marrying off his son Hamouda, on the 14th land of exile. We are a people who does not fear death. We are a steadfast people. As the Prophet Muhammad said: "The people of the Levant are steadfast, them and their descendants, until the Judgment Day…" Shut the fuck up, jerk! Any bachelor is an idiot until he gets married. Well said. We are being subjected to extermination. They’re chucking barrel bombs, missiles, everything at us… Nothing can protect us but our own willies of prey. - Whoever doesn't have a willy… - Should go get one. Look at those rusted 25 years old, without children. At your age I already had four! - Shame on you. - They want a house and a job… We used to get married in a tent! - In a tent, tell them! - In a tent, yes. Which one of you wasn't conceived in a tent? Most of you were conceived in the fields. - "God will make the poor rich." - Child first and wealth follows. A Palestinian immigrates, but his balls stay home. I've had it with you. No immigrating Palestinian testicle has ever been recorded. "He who's getting married, may God grant him more." And the bachelor should raise his hand. My wife is as beautiful as the full moon, Glory to the Creator. What are you up to? - What’s up? - We want to draw on the walls. - Draw what? - We want to draw… - Everyone has their own drawing. - We want to draw for peace. - For what? - Peace. Why? So they understand us. Who? - What? - Who "they"? - Humans. - Whoever’s blocking peace. For those outside to hear us. Ok. What will you draw? - What will you draw? - Uh… A whale, a bear, and a flower. - Louder! - A whale, a bear, and a flower! Why a whale, a bear, and a flower? - Why? - Because they told us to. - They told you what to draw? - Yes. You’re not drawing what you want? - No. - Yes, but… - Ok cut! - No, speak your mind. Don't be scared. - Come back, don't be scared. - I’m not! So they told you to draw a whale… and a monkey - oops! I mean a flower. - No. - Then, what? Nothing. We can draw and write what we want about peace. - What did you decide to draw? - A gun with an X on it, and another shooting out love hearts. - With love hearts? - Yes, and written on it: "The darkness of war shall leave, the candles of peace will be lit". Hello. Is the old lady here? - Can we come in? - Please come in. Let’s greet the young men first. Hello guys. Ibrahim, take the old man’s ID card to the NGO, they need all his information. Are they going to evacuate him? - Maybe, but register him first. - I’m not registering anything… - How are you feeling? - Tired. - She's tired. - Why? - She hasn't eaten for days. - Why not? - Why aren't you eating? - She has no appetite. Can't even drink water. Your hands are warm. No, you’re fine. But you have to eat. If you don’t eat, you won’t get better. - I can't. - What’s wrong? If you ask me to move my legs, I just can't. - Because you're not eating! - I can’t. Is your mouth dry? - Huh? - Is your mouth dry? She hasn't eaten in three days. We tried but she refused. - I see. - What shall we do? Fluids. Soup. - We are making a lot of it. - Cactus soup, they say it's good. She doesn't like it at all! She throws it in my face. Why don’t you have cactus soup? Thank you for your kindness. - You haven't forgotten about me. - Nobody has and I won’t. - God bless you. - Get her rice or something. I don't want rice or anything else. What are we supposed to do? A kilo of rice costs about 10,000. We’re forced to eat weeds, damn it. We don’t have enough to buy rice, so what are we supposed to eat? - Normally we trash this… - I swear I ate it last night. Peel it and eat it. This is a potato. It’s my invention. There’s nothing left to eat. No more weeds, nothing but cactus. I had radish, but I ran out. God only knows for tomorrow. Think of what the bastards outside eat and look at us… If they had a conscience… It's not that bad, it's good. If you cook it, it's good. Brother, if we don't eat… At least it fills our stomachs. Make sure you boil it well. I swear if we had a choice… I don't know… God Almighty. - How many did you get? - Three. I swear if it stays like this, I'll kill a dog and eat it. I swear I will. I’ll slaughter it here, grill it and eat it. I'll soak it in garlic and vinegar and eat it. Under siege, walking is a ritual of survival. The ultimate practice of freedom, training for the isolation imposed by the darkness of home. Under siege, people endlessly walk in districts with fragmented boundaries. They pick up pieces of smiles that death didn’t stumble upon the previous night. They search for food among the weeds that grow secretely in the corners of pavements. Walking under siege is the final weapon to defend the details of a place against loss. Under siege, walk as much as you can. But don’t trample on anything you might have to eat one day. Walk on air. For the second time, our group of Red Crescent volunteers went to get food parcels from the checkpoint and again we failed. The distribution point was targeted with 23mm munitions. This time, five tank shells were fired at the same location. It's the 2° time we try, and again the aid can't enter the camp. Why is it failing every time? There is no genuine will to lift the siege of Yarmouk. There is no real pressure put on the Syrian government to make them allow food into Yarmouk. Otherwise, we wouldn't have to walk all this way for nothing. And if you don't let the food in, just let the people go outside. For 6 months, they let people go out to get food. Open the road, so people can get food, stop pretending it's impossible because of armed groups. If they wanted to allow food in, they would organize aid drops. Instead of dropping barrel bombs, they could drop food parcels. It costs just as much. They could even drop both: barrel bombs and wheat. A barrel bomb on the right, and some wheat on the left. That would be ok, we'll take it. But there's no will. The aim is to wipe out Yarmouk and the Palestinian presence in Syria, and the right to return from this place. Sir, we're picking these weeds, is that ok? Since Abdallah is filming you, ok. Otherwise I'd kick you out of here! All right, film us! There is Abdallah. I'm eating weeds, look! Booga (Abdallah) is filming us! We're eating cattle food! There you go. - Can I blow it up? - Yes, whatever you want. - How are you? - We're good. Good? Are you cold? Yes. - I'm so sorry, why? - I don't know how to inflate it. - Shall I do it? - Yes. At your service. - Do you want it big or small? - Big. - Is this good? - Yes. - What's your name? - Abboudeh. Abboudeh, nice name. She overslept, it seems. - Hello, how are you? - Hi. Good morning. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. Let me sit you down on a chair. How are you doing? Did you recognize me? Who am I? I'm the doctor. I came the other day for your blood pressure. - Welcome. - Thank you. How are you? Getting better, I hope. - How are you? - Good, seeing you makes me happy. - Shall I take your blood pressure? - You can take whatever you want. She’s got high blood pressure. 16/10. You have to give her the drug to bring it down. How do you feel? Anything in particular? Not really. So I have to take it every day? Of course, every day. - Really? - Yes! Not when you feel like it! I give it to her, but then she forgets to take it. No, you have to take it. So that your blood pressure goes back to normal. - Ok, I will… - I'll test your blood sugar level? Give me your hand. In the name of God the merciful… I'm sorry. She's dehydrated. Try these. What is this? Candy. Take the whole bag. PALESTINE HOSPITAL UNRWA! United Nations! Red Crescent! Red Cross! We are in Yarmouk Camp, for the Palestinian refugees! We call you. We implore you. We are without medicine. We’ve torn up our blankets. Our bandages are from our blankets. From our… head… Shoulders! We use our keffiyeh for bandages! People, we need medicine. The bleeding man… has no bleeding stop utilities. We have no equipment to stop the bleeding. Our wounded are bleeding to death. Where are you, Red Cross? You represent Christ! Christ is a Palestinian! And he's a refugee in heaven. The people of Yarmouk are dying! From Yarmouk to Palestine! God is greater! Open the checkpoints, break the siege! "I'm case 80. I died from hunger in the siege of Yarmouk Camp" The besieged partake in their pain as if it were a message from heaven apportioned by prophets. There is enough pain in sorrow for everyone to feel the need for tears. One ceiling collapsing is enough for everyone to feel exposed. Sorrow is as obvious as an apple, as obsessive as a loaf of bread, as open as the sky. All the mothers cry over a child who’s not theirs when they see the thirst in the cradle, and the eternal sleep. Under siege, individual sorrow is a luxury, and secret sorrow, an unforgiveable betrayal. For the besieged, collective pain is a quality and the path to survival. Under siege, don’t hide your sorrow from others like a hero. Feel the pain and weep with them as much as you can. She just had some milk and vitamins. - What's her name? - Israa. - Did you get her milk today? - A tiny bit, not enough for a day. As for tomorrow, God only knows. There's nothing left. Prayer for the dead at the mosque for the martyrs of hunger. Oh mother, God is greater than they are! Oh mother, they killed Israa with their bare hands! There is no God but Allah! And the murderer is the enemy of God! Oh mother, God is greater than they are! Oh mother, they killed Israa with their bare hands! Oh mother, they killed Israa with their bare hands! The siege will expel humanity from the hidden crevices of the soul, all at once, and with great violence. It will blow apart your internal contradictions. Good will push you to run behind rockets and lift the rubble off children left by their parents when they fled at the sound of an airplane. Evil will tempt you to sell the milk of the same children in order to buy a pinch of tobacco. Under siege, watch over yourself carefully. Defeat the evil that exists within you. Children are dying. A baby can't get a drop of milk. Or any food. Our stomachs have dried up. I swear to God I'm suffering from dehydration. What is this? Why don't we just get rid of this? Let's storm the checkpoint. Death only comes once! Once, my son. Let's all storm the checkpoint. Either we die, or we’re saved. Yarmouk! Yarmouk! The - people - wants to break the siege! They're going for it! Go! Go! Go! Film me, Abdallah! Yarmouk, Yarmouk! Yarmouk’s inhabitants are trying to break Bashar's siege. God is great! Look, Al-Rijeh Square! - Long time no see… - God, how beautiful. Come here Abdallah. You can film from here. One, one, one, Palestinians and Syrians are one! Peaceful, peaceful! Get inside! Slow death by hunger is unlike any other death in the grief and agony of the besieged. A mother cries on her way back because she has no food for her children who haven’t eaten anything for days. She cries out of powerlessness. She cries even more when she sees a plane overhead bearing another death with another taste. A quicker death, which she longs for, a less painful death for herself and for her children. She wishes for it. She cries even more when the plane ignores her. No death resembles death under siege. Resentment kindles the desire for the most extreme justice. Under siege, justice means revenge, and revenge only. Beware of excessive spite and hate, for you will lose yourself. Due to the lack of food and medication. We're going to the Palestine Hospital for the autopsy, and then we'll wash her body. God protect you, Umm Mahmoud. - God sends good people our way. - Are you going to the hospital? The poor woman, she lived alone and died of hunger. Only one woman used to visit her every day. May she be rewarded. This is the woman. … first a death certificate, and then the religious committee. Rest in peace, Hamda. - Should I go too, Umm Mahmoud? - Yes. - Are you going? - Maybe. Thank God for you, Umm Mahmoud. - Thank you. - May she rest in peace. - How many old people do you visit? - So many… - How many have died? - Many have died. They dropped it! Ambulance! Lift him up! Film this! Here is your barrel, Bashar al-Assad! God is greater! Kill us with missiles, we won’t starve to death. We won’t die without dignity. Get out the way for the ambulance! Bring them here! The building is about to collapse! It was a barrel bomb. "One, one, one! Palestinians and Syrians are one!" We were "one, one, one" until they fucked us. - Keep calm. - I am calm. You're being divisive. This has nothing to do with us! Film everything, film! Here is the humanitarian aid for Yarmouk. Right here! Missile after missile… Let me hear you, Yarmouk! Missile after missile… And Yarmouk becomes more glorious! Yarmouk becomes more glorious! Get the pliers from Abu Ezz, tell him it's for Jamal. I'm fixing the internet cable so that I can make calls. We want to live. We were born to live! Let’s spell it out to them: we were born to live. Neither they nor their bombs will finish us off. Only God Almighty can finish us off. They can’t finish anything off, apart from themselves. They belittle themselves. Which is their own misfortune. I AM FROM A COUNTRY WHERE WINDOWS OPEN ON THE ABSENCE OF FOOD. This way, this way. The clock ticks on same as everyday And the night seeks A little sleep The clock ticks on same as everyday And the night seeks A little sleep The clock ticks on And the night is still dark The clock ticks on and the night is still dark Time stretches on And the moon isn't yet full. Time stretches on And the moon isn't yet full. The clock ticks on. And the pain is all behind me. A bird was singing on a stone Yarmouk is nothing but papers and images now The door of joy opened But the pain is bigger Where is the pain gone? Under siege, a fire that winter snuffed out will be kindled inside you. With a blow, all your values will collapse in front of you. When you see your memories silently playing out, when the future sticks out its tongue sarcastically, when the most obvious answers to simple questions are as rare as a lump of sugar, when you feel like your existence in the universe doesn’t measure up to a sesame seed, pull yourself together. Don’t surrender. Open your eyes and scream: I will defeat this siege. I will defeat this siege. - Young man! - Yes, sir. Do you have a sugar almond or something? I swear to God, I don't. A sugar almond or anything… - You live alone, no children? - No, I won’t lie. You know… - You're all alone. - I am, yes. - And you're still in the camp. - I live in the camp. What does the Yarmouk Camp mean to you? I don't know… It’s a camp. - How do you get by? - I buy herbs here and there. and I cook them in this pot. With this oil. And I have these spices. Here they are, do you see? Here are the spices and here is the oil. What can I do? - When did you last have rice? - I haven't since… I crave it. I wish I had a plate of rice. I swear to God. And to Muhammad. - It's been a long time? - It has… yes. There’s no rice. I beg for some herbs over there. I borrow anything for a fire, and you saw the rest. I need to eat. What can I do? SEEKING HUMANITARIAN ASYLUM. The people of Yarmouk sign this petition for humanitarian asylum from European countries, and all other countries that respect human rights. We want bread. 22 January 2014 65 years, and we haven’t got anywhere. We don’t want Palestine. Just get us out of Syria! Is there anything worse than this hunger? You go there, humiliation! You come here, humiliation! Wherever you go, humiliation! In Europe at least you live like a human, not an animal. Animals live better than us. A delegation came to the school! - What’s the delegation for? - To open the road. - Where’s the delegation from? - From outside. Film me! - What are they going to do? - It’s to bring us food. - Maybe they won’t let the food in? - They will. If not, God help us! - What do you expect from this? - To eat! - What about the resistance? - I want roasted chicken! Good morning, guys. Give me your ID card if you're from the camp. - He's Palestinian-Jordanian. - Then they won’t give him any. We'll bring you a food box when we're back. I don't want any food box! I'm not going to do a picnic. Wait in the hospital, my dear. - Please, take me with you. - I’ll take care of you. - Go inside, have some rest. - Take me with you. It's not a pleasant trip, I swear. It's an uncomfortable journey, I swear. Take your ID son, keep it with you. My dear, wait for me here. Wait for us until we bring you back a food box. It's very tough at the checkpoint. It won’t work, I can't bring you. - I can't take her with me. - Why? She can't stand up! It's dangerous at the checkpoint. - There are doctors there. - Doctors? Oh please! Yesterday a man died after being trampled. You know who it was? Ghada's husband. Walid's sister, Sanaa's daughter-in-law. - Really? - Yes, him. God have mercy! See? She's unwell, what can I do? Let her sit. - Yes, but her leg’s broken. - Let me sit in the back instead. Come on, we'll be back in 5 minutes. Umm Mahmoud…! Enough! I'll be back in 5 minutes. People of Yarmouk, please step back a little. Please, you will all get a box but move back. Please step back. Step back, step back! Please sit down! Sit down! We don't want their help. Just open the road, let us out, we can sleep on the street. We don't want to sit here, we don't want to stay. We want to earn our food and eat with dignity. No boxes. Lift the siege. We've waited since 5am for nothing. Those who know people get things, but we don't. We have no one but God. We only have God on our side. The besieged becomes addicted to the idea of the siege, like the prisoner gets addicted to the darkness of the prison out of fear of the sun. You might see the siege falter suddenly, and believe it will end, and you’ll feel terrified on its behalf. You’ll say: What happens after the siege? You’ll be frightened of the life without the siege. You've forgotten this life, and how to live it. But don’t worry and have no regrets. Trust that you’ve won because you’ve been united with the siege. If the siege ends before you do, cling tight to what it taught you. Don’t forget anything. For you might have to survive death in an even greater siege. Where people die from indigestion and servility, not from hunger and dignity. I dream of seeing my mother and eating bread. Like everyone! I dream of all the detainees being released. I want to hear my grandmother, to eat bread, and for everybody to be fine, may it please God. I dream of breaking the siege. I dream of eating shawarma and seeing Hassan Hassan online again. I dream of my father returning. I dream of eating a chicken sandwich. - I dream of eating shawarma. - I dream of eating sugar. I dream of my father going back to how he was. I dream of the camp going back to how it was. I dream of the road opening. - I also dream of the road opening. - You just spoke! You said you dreamed of sugar! I dream of my brother coming back to life. I do! I dream that my brother is alive again. Because I miss him so much. - What are you doing? - Foraging for some verbena. - Foraging for what? - Verbena. - Why? Is it edible? We didn't use to eat it, but now, because of the hunger, we do. - Do you eat it everyday? - We don't have anything else. Huh? We do eat it everyday, we can't find anything else. Sometimes we just boil water and… - Water and what? - And spices. - Where are you from? - Al-Hajirah. - What grade are you in? - Fourth grade. - Are you going to school? - No. Why not? We could, but they won't let us because we're displaced. Who? Did you try registering? Try, they'll let you. I know a school that will admit you. - Do you want to register? - I’ve already missed half of it. - It's not worth it? - Not this year. - Can you eat it raw? - Well, you cook it. But you're eating it raw. Let me have some. You can make salads and soups with it, it's tasty. They say it's poisonous. Only the big blooming ones. This one has no flowers. The blooming ones are poisonous? Yes. They sell big ones at the market but these ones are small. These are good? - What's your name? - Tasnim. What did you use to dream about, Tasnim? - I never dreamed of anything. - Nothing? - Food, that's all. - And now what do you dream about? - Just food. - What do you feel like? Everything. Fries, pizza, chicken, halva, jam, bread… - Bread is what I miss the most. - You miss bread? It's ok. God will compensate us one day. Aren't you afraid of the sound of shelling? I'm not afraid. We're used to it. - What if a shell landed here? - Then God have mercy on our souls. - What? - God have mercy on our souls. God have mercy on our souls. - Don't you love life? - I love it, but not here. - Where then? - Outside. With food and joy, school and play. And television. - But here, life’s unlovable. - It’s unlovable. Are you tired? We're tired, but what can we do? Children toil until they're exhausted these days. They’re exhausted. Some children collect firewood for warmth. Some children forage for food. That’s what happens to children here? Before, they'd go to school and play… Now what? Now they've grown old and they’re exhausted. - They've grown old? - They’ve grown old. All of us. Even my sister picks these and eats them. She's one and a half year old. There she is, foraging with my other sister. - Where are your parents? - At home. Dad is checking on the food boxes, and the road, or whatever… Mummy is working around the house, and when… When I bring these, she'll cook them for us. Sometimes she forages with us. But I have a little brother. He stays at home. He's 6 months old. He cries when he’s left alone. Tasnim, are you scared of tomorrow? - Huh? - Are you scared of tomorrow? No, I'm not scared. Are you scared things will get even worse? I hope they don't get worse. Even worse than this? Here we are, eating verbena and… My dad went to that school, where they're giving out water with… spices… He went to get some. There’s nothing left. And my mother isn't eating enough she's not… She can’t… - Milk. - Yes, and then… My brother cries all the time. He's hungry.
