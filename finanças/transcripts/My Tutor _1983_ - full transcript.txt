Dummy, dummy, dummy. C'mon, it's over. Time to kick out the jams. Summer time fun. Dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy. Quit it with the ball-peen hammer imitation. Here's Bonnie. - Where? - There. Hi, Bonnie! Bobby, I've been looking for you. You didn't sign my yearbook. Same here. Here you go. "To the girl who's meant the most to me all through high school. Love, Bobby." That's really sweet, Bobby. I gotta go. I'll see you, okay? What did she write? "To the funniest guy in third period study hall. Bonnie." Very romantic. Tonight's the night, fellas! The sacrifice of the virgins. Not so loud! Time to go to the drug store and get you fitted. Eight o'clock. Bravo, Bravo, let's go! We're running late. Not too much. She'll slide off. C'mon. We're going to a whorehouse. We are not getting married here. What the hell you got in there? These are the old "Johnny Walker Black" I stole this from my father. It's pretty good stuff. He never drinks it. Go ahead. It'll cool your nerves. What a stuff. Come on. Let's go. - I wanna brush my hair. - Yeah. Later. This is it! This is it! I don't know about this, guys. My stomach doesn't feel too good, you know. - How about another night? - I think we should go. Oh, Billy. For these two we have the graduation present. So? Which one is your brother, Jack? Right here, over here. That's me! A real eager beaver. For you we have Louisa. First time up at the plate, right, Jack? Yes, but I am out to win rookie of the year. And now for you, we have something very very special. Anna-Maria. Give me your hand, Jack. Okey dokey. - Up against the wall. - All right. There you go. What's going on? You'll see. Oh, boy, this is gonna be really wild. - Now give me your other hand. - All right. Are you sure about this? Maybe this is a little advanced for me. Don't worry. It'll be wonderful. You like it? Are you ready, Jack? Oh yes, I'm ready! Oh my god! So am I. Come over here my little bambino. Climb the mountain. How does it feel? Wonderful. But wouldn't it be better if I was untied? But your brother wanted you to have the full treatment. - Is it good? - Oh, yes. Do you like surprises? Oh, yes. Good. This is wild. You can handle it. Bambino, wake up. Wake up. Billy, what kind of weirdo did you set me up with in there? I almost got killed! - Hey, I didn't know, alright? - Yeah, yeah. well, next time do a little legwork, will you? This is ridiculous. I don't believe it. You can't even get laid in a whorehouse. Did you have a good time? Maria. Fruit, salad, lunch. Rose bushes, trim. - Fruit, salad… - Lunch! - Manuel… - Ah, rose bushes trim! - Hi, honey! - Hi, mom! - Where's dad, mom? - He is in the study. I'm late for lunch. Sit down, Bobby. It's been quite a morning. Mr. Simpson called me off school. It seems that we have a problem. You flunked your French final. I've been on the phone to Yale and they will hold your place on one condition: that you take a makeup exam. The only catch is, you've got to do better than 85. I've already contacted a language agency. And as of tomorrow morning the best freelance French teacher in the city is gonna be here. She is gonna live here. And you're gonna work with her every day, and I want to assure you, you are going to pass that exam. I don't mind telling you. This has been damn embarrassing. Hello, Bobby. I'm Terry Green, your French tutor. We're gonna be working together this summer. - I suppose we have to start today. - Tomorrow is soon enough. It's too soon for me. How about next week. I'm sorry. One-day summer vacation. Terrific. In addition, if you succeed and Bobby passes there will be a final bonus payment of 10,000 dollars. That's quite a bonus. I want you as committed to this as I am. Now, I'd like this part of our bargain to be just between us. I don't want Bobby to know about it, do you understand? Yes. He is under enough pressure already. God knows he has been quite a disappointment to me. His attitude, his grades… I had to pull quite a few strings to get him into Yale and now this. What is so important about Yale? Because I went there. And being a Yalie is just about the finest memory I've ever had in my life. - I want the same for Bobby. - What does Bobby want? He is too young to know what he wants. All I know is what I want and that is for him to pass that exam. Ok. The verb "être". To be. Conjugation. Bobby? I hate this French crap. No, no. En français: "Je déteste cette merde française", oui? Oui. You got the picture. I even hate French fries. - "Pommes frites". - Yeah, right. "Pommes frites". - Excellent pronunciation. - Dumb luck. Look, forget it. No way I'm gonna pass this exam. We might as well just chuck it. You'll pass. There isn't a student made that I can't teach. A little conceited, aren't you? I'm very good. What are you getting out of this? A little money. A quiet place to stay for a month or so. Well, how come you're not married? Or have a boyfriend at least. I don't think that's any of your business, Bobby. Hey, come on, give me a break. I'm trying to learn about life and love, here. Okay. I had a boyfriend, we broke up, and I needed a place to stay. Is that okay? Well, how come you broke up? This is none of your business. Will you please read your book? I can tell you're gonna work me hard this summer. That's my job, "n'est-ce pas?" Okay, if this doesn't work out there's always Mexico. Guys are getting down there for sure. Oh, no, I am not going to Mexico. You can catch all kinds of diseases down there. That's just if you drink the water, you turkey. - Yeah, same difference. - I heard it, all right? Be cool. Remember I got you covered, all right? Oh boy. Oh boy. She won't hurt me. No whips. He promised. Hey, Billy, I don't know about this. Hey, what's to know? You guys are about to get your lances waxed. No big thing! Even now as we speak, right this very second, millions of people are just banging away like crazy. It's a fact of life. That's kind of an awesome thought. Yeah, it is, isn't it? She is athletic. I'm on my break. Let's do it. - Odd or even? - Even. Damn. We'll be in the bar across the street. Save some for me! I've only got ten minutes. Ten minutes? I got a Chrysler 'cause it has the biggest back seat. Nice. - Aw shit!! - What? - It's my boyfriend. - Your Boyfriend!? Well, actually we're engaged to be married. He hates when I do this. The last guy he caught, he dragged behind his bike in chains. Oh, don't worry, it was only over dirt. Sylvia! Sylvia, where is he? I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna tear out his eyeballs! I'm gonna rip his arm off and beat him to death with it. I want that son of a bitch! There's the little prick! Say your prayers, boy. You're about to meet Jesus. That's not him! That's not him! That's not him! - It's not me! It's not me! It's not me! - You sure? Of course I'm sure. I wouldn't ball anything that lame even for money. Thank you. Hey, was it as good as I said? Did I cover you or what? Let's go. Come on. Okay, here you go. Try these, fifteen minutes. Starting now. Bobby, get to work. Okay. I'm going to go get a drink. Do you want anything? - No, thanks. - Okay, I'll be right back. Bobby, where are you? Oh, boy. No work. I can't leave you alone for a second. Here. It looks like you could use this. Thanks. Okay, get to work. It's too hot. Bobby, will you just do the test, please. It's really way too hot. - Now that's better. - I take it this is a study break. Great idea. I'm glad you thought of it. All right then. Teacher gets to take a break too. Where did you learn to speak French so well? I went to college in France. I knew it. Nobody can learn to speak French in California. Spanish, maybe. French, no way. - I should have taken Spanish. - Why didn't you? My Dad thought it was a good idea. He wants me to study International Law at Yale. Oh yeah? You do everything your father wants you to do? No. Not always. If I had it my way I'd go to UCLA and study astronomy. I'm sorry. But you know I'm not hired here to be a guidance counselor. And no matter what school you go to you still have to pass the test, so please. How old are you? - Would you stop stalling? - Forty? - Forty-five? Twenty-five? - Twenty nine. - Have you ever been married? - No. Engaged? - Yes and no. - You lived with a guy, right? That last guy you just went up with, huh? I wish you were as good at French as you are at Twenty Questions. Vingt questions. Très bien. Get to work. You pervert. I promised her a ride home. Well, how are things going between you and your tutor? Okay. Have you tried to score with her yet? Come on, Jack. What, are you kidding? I know I would've scored with her by now. Just you and her, alone, by the pool… I would've been there and back a couple of times by now. Jack, you don't believe your own bullshit, do you? And I'm going to hit the ceiling tonight. It's only an 80. Hey, come on, an 80 up from a 17 is pretty good for two week's work. Yeah, but you have to get 5 more points if it was the real test. No backing out now. You promised a celebration lunch even if I broke 70. - You had this planned. - Of course. Not only lunch but now you have the rare opportunity to practice your new vocabulary under fire. Great. Now, I'm going to teach you a skill that all young men should know. What's that? - The art of tasting wine. - Sounds vital. It's where you can impress all the girls before you seduce them. Now it sounds like life or death. First thing you do is sniff the bouquet. Then you take a healthy sip, and you move it around your mouth so that the tongue can taste it from all sides like so. You're not supposed to gargle. Can't take you anywhere. So, Cindy, put through all my calls to Le Rendezvous. I'm trying to close the Condo deal. Be very careful. She's an absolutely flawless classic. Yes, sir. Not a scratch. Okay, my man? Right, sir. Pierre, how are you? My table over here? Roger, hi. Ed! Oh, no. Anything but this. Where have you been? Why did you disappear? Why haven't you called me? I've been looking for you for weeks. Why do you want me to say this again? It's over. It can't be over. You just get up and walked out. Not a word, nothing. I don't know what you want me to say, It's just not fair! Fair? One day you're living with me and the next day you disappear without a goodbye. And you're talking about fair? Monsieur Sylvester. There is a telephone call for you. I'll call back. But your secretary says it is an emergency. Yes Cindy, put him through. Hello, Sid. I just talked with Miller and if you want those condos they'll cost you 200 K a piece. I love you, Terry. Forget what happened. That's over, honey. I can change. Sid, the price is right. He'll take one third down. The terms are terrific! - Yeah, that's right. - Let's go. No problem. Wait. Terry, don't go. I said I love you. Doesn't that mean anything? I wanna be with you! I wanna be with you forever! How can you turn down an offer like that? You'll be turning over a half million profit in 18 months, goddamnit. Would you just… Wait a second, Terry, talk to me. No, not you, Sid! Is your name Terry, for Christ sake? Goddammit, Sid, just take that fucking deal! Would you just talk to me? I can't keep this up, I gave up jogging. Who is this kid? Are you teaching nursery school or what? Nice night for a stroll, huh, Bobby? I couldn't sleep. I had my telescope out. You shouldn't spy on people. It's not fair. Bobby, Would you look at me? It's okay. Just no more spying. Is that understood? Okay. Go to bed. Well, this way boys, over there. Oh this is gonna look wonderful today. Yes. That is the place. No, no. No, I like it better over there. Yes, that's it. Yes, definitely over there. No, wait, please. I think I like it where we tried it the first time. Right here. What do you think? Oh, it's so hard to decide without setting it all up. It takes an hour to set this tent up ma'am. An hour? Is that all? Well maybe we could set it up in all the places I picked. What do you think? - Hi, mom. - Hi, honey. Where's Terry? She went for a drive. She said she'll be back for your lesson. - A drive with who? - A man. Honey, you know that tent we had for your birthday? Where do you think we should set it up? Over there, over there, or over here? - I think it looks fine right here. - Oh, fine. Thank you honey. Okay, boys, set it up. Right here. Wait! I'm not sure. Where were you? - You're late. - Not that late. Hey, sport, don't get so bent out of shape. I guess you and I just got off on the wrong foot. I'm Don Sylvester. You know you almost made me wrap my bike around that pole. I'm sorry about that. I was a desperate man, though Bobby. I couldn't let my girl get away without a chase now, could I? Well, I gotta go. - Study time, you know? - I'll be right there. All right. Here you are. Come on, Bobby, wipe that long face off. Can't just pick you smiling. Yeah, the guy in this picture is 6'5'' and has long blond hair. This is never gonna work, Billy. Trust me and ye shall be delivered. Look, the guy at the door is a friend of mine. These are just for show. I've got you covered, huh? Wonderful. Bobby, you look like you're going to a funeral. What's the matter? - Nothing. Let's go. - All right. Come on. Oh shit! Duane's not here tonight. Billy, this will never do! This will never do! Too late now. Go for it! Hey Blood! What's happenin', man? All right, all right! Please blood, please! Don, it's Terry. Don? And stay out, punks! What the hell's wrong with you, guys? You're nuts to go jumping in that ring! I couldn't help myself. They're the most beautiful girls in the world. Yeah, we're going to wait for them. That blonde is really crazy for me. I could tell. She was pinning me, she was really getting off. I'll be in the car. Can you believe those guys? They must be crazy! Don't you get out of the car you bastard. - I can explain. - Come on! You weren't supposed to be here. I can't believe you're saying this! Don't get out of the car. I'm going to cut it off! Excuse me, girls. We just want to tell you how much we enjoy your work. Well, if there is any way to wrestle with you privately. Also, it may be of some interest to you that I am unusually well endowed and happy to demonstrate that fact at any moment. You little turds again. I'm gonna break you in pieces. I love her! I love her! Put my dress back here! I'm naked! Hi, Terry. Oh! Hi, Bobby. Mind if I sit down? No, please. So, it looks like things didn't work out, huh? No. - You were right about him. - What happened? Let's just say one woman's not enough for him. I'm sorry to hear that. Thanks. Well, actually, I'm glad you're here. It's nice to be wanted somewhere. What did you do tonight? Nothing special. We watched a couple of ladies roll around in the mud and get all wet. Sounds exciting. It wasn't. - I was thinking about you. - What were you thinking? I guess I was jealous. Hey, what's wrong? Nothing. I've got to go. Terry, I'm really sorry that this guy hurt your feelings. Thank you.

Want to speak to you. Yes, sir. How long have I known… How long have your father and I been business associates? - All my life. - That's right. All your life. So… You would say I have your best interests at heart. Yes, I'd say that. And I want to say one word to you, Robert. Just one word. Computer chips. Computer… - Computer chips. - That's two words. It's the future. Never forget that. - Hi, boys. - Hello. - Oh, hello, hello, Mrs. Crystal. - Oh, thank you. - Good punch? - It's terrific! It is the very best. Thank you. Go easy, it has a very heavy kick to it. Oh, my, nice. Now you want a little bit more of this, don't you, Mrs. Crystal? - No. No. - Oh, yes, yes. Just a little. Easy does it. Terry! May I speak with you? Would you mind refilling my drink for me. Not at all. Scotch, right? That's right. And while you're at it, make one for yourself. No, thank you. So, how is Bobby doing? Is he really applying himself? He's doing great. He's working really hard. And you're very fond of him. Yeah. No, have a place. Come on. Sit here and talk with me while I have my drink. How's the party going? Lively. That band is really interesting. I hate parties. It's my wife's idea. She has so few, I like to indulge the occasional ones she has. Hey, can we cut through this small talk, Terry? I find you very, very attractive. And to come right to the point, I would like to sleep with you. It would be worth a great deal to me. I'm afraid that's not possible. - Really? - Really. Why not? You see, I just don't like men that think they can have anything they want just because they have money. Is that to the point enough to you. Slut! Hi. Hi, Bonnie, how you been? Good. You look terrific. - What did you do? - Nothing. Same old me. No. There's somethin' different. You must be chasing some girl. Who is she? There's no one. How about you. Still seeing that college guy? Biff? Sure. Biff? Come on, nobody's named Biff. - I do believe you're jealous. - Baloney. I love her. She's fantastic. No. She hates you like poison. She's always hated you. Oh, come on, she's crazy about me. Sue Anne, would you care to dance with me? No, thank you. Then I suppose a blow job is just completely out of the question. Hi. Well, Bobby, I'm not sure this is right. I'm worried that you're getting the wrong idea. Like what? Like this is more serious than it is. I don't want you to get hurt, okay? Terry, don't worry about me. I'm not the sensitive, vulnerable type, You're not? What type are you? The lewd, crude, couldn't-give-a-damn type. Come on in before your parents catch us. And why, pray tell, are you sneaking from my bed, sir? Because my parents are gonna be up any minute now. Terry, something I have to know before I go. Yeah. How am I doing? I don't have anything to go on. You know, nothing to compare. Bobby, you're wonderful. How about on a scale of one to ten. You're a ten. Well, you're a nine and a half, nobody is perfect. - You gotta go. - Yeah, right. Son. You better get up. You're gonna be all stiff. Thanks, Dad. Pulling all night. I'm proud of you. But I think you better get some real sleep. Good idea, Dad. - What do you want? - I'm here to see Terry. - Get out of my way. - She's not home. I will see about that. - I told you. - I'll wait. The hell you will. Look your trespassing. Now get lost. Don't make threats to me I'm a third degree black belt in Karate. I know a hundred different ways to bust you up in seconds. Wait here. I only know one way to squeeze this trigger. Hi! What can I do for you? I'm looking for a night gown for my aunt. If it's for your aunt, I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place. I suggest you Roebuck. Well, actually it's for my girlfriend. Girlfriend. That's more like it. Is she tall, short, skinny, fat, big bosom, flat chested? What's the story? Medium size. And very well put together. Oh, you are a diplomat, aren't you? And how old is she? Thirty. Thirty? Not bad. Not bad. A modern relationship. I like it. I think I have just the thing for you. As you can see a matching set of leather restrainers and riding crop to go with this. I think that's a little too much. - Too much? - Yeah. Hi, Bobby. Hi, Bonnie. What you reading? Nothing. Schoolwork. What subject? French. Looks like fun. Good night, Bobby. We'll be at the Marshalls if you need us. Good night, Mom. You have a good time. Jack called earlier, are you gonna to see him tonight? I guess so. I don't know. Well, whatever you do, have a good time. I will. Are you kidding with this? Put your knee up there. No human being can twist like that. Where is my foot? - Wait a second. - Is that you? - Is there someone else in here? - That is the way. - I don't think that's the… - It worked in the book. Don't believe everything you read. Just… Bobby, making love has nothing to do with those wild positions. It has got to do with feelings. And, honey, you definitely got the feeling. I don't know. I'm not sure I wanna go to Stanford Law in the fall. Maybe I should just go to Berkeley and take advantage of the tuition break. Papa has his heart set on you going to Stanford. All the boys have gone there. All the same, I'm a bit partial to being closer to San Francisco. Good morning, Mrs. Chrystal. Maria, you… water… plants… yet? Si. Yes. Water. Manuel. Lawn. Mow? Mow? Qué? Cut? Cut. Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. ¡Ah, sí! "Cut, cut, cut" Muy bien. Oh, I just love talking Spanish. Terry, guess what. They're going away for the whole weekend. Now, if I can only get rid of Manuel and Maria… You make this sound like a murder mystery. Just give them the weekend off. Great idea! Why didn't I think of that? - Terry, you have to talk to me. - Go away, it's over! - Are you and this kid getting it on? - Get lost, you creep! You stay out of this. Terry, I love you. You know you are the only one. - Bugger off. - Drop dead. - Please, leave us alone. - Us? You two are making it. - What if we are? - I can't believe it. Well, it's true. And he is ten times the lover you are! I'll kill you! My baby. My baby. My baby. Thank God he's all right. All right. Come on now, let's move on. We've got a beautiful day. Raphael, would you put those things in the trunk. Darling, his name is Manuel. Dear, what's the difference. Raphael, Manuel, all right. Keep your eye on the ball. I love you. Be a good boy. Thank you, honey. - Have a good time. - Thank you. No, no, that's it, Raphael. Put those down. All right, son. It's all yours now. - Hold the fort. - Thanks, dad. Hey, Manuel, can I speak to you for a second? Si, señor. Why don't you and Maria take the weekend off. Come on, Manuel, knock it off. I know you and Maria speak perfect English. How long have you known? A couple of years. It's all right. Your secret's safe with me. Just take the weekend off for yourselves. We will. - And, Bobby, gracias. - De nada. Hmmm, Bobby, you are wonderful. Bobby, how long can you keep that up? As long as I want. Billy, I don't see why we can't go back to the whorehouse tonight. Are you kidding? You whacked all their stuff. They'd shoot you on sight. Picky, picky, picky. There's always Mexico. Down in Tijuana you could march right down main streets take a ten dollar bill in your teeth and your problems are over. No. I am not going to Mexico. I refuse. No way, Jose. Mexico! Bobby, what do you think your parents would say if they could see us right now? I don't think they'd say anything. I think they would just make some gurgling sounds and have a heart attack. Do you think they suspect anything? - No. I doubt it. - Phew. That's good. Because some day I may have to ask them for a reference, you know. - I'll give you one hell of a reference. - I'm sure you would. That's not going to help me in teaching work. Why you don't come to collage with me. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of subjects I'm going to have trouble with. I only teach French. Maybe I can major in French. Who knows? If I study hard enough. I could become a Frenchman. Nope, after the summer the tutoring stops. All the tutoring? Yes. Don't say any more. Where's the wine? So, Bobby, Terry tells me that you have a heavy crammed session this weekend. Oh, we have. And you're ready for the exam tomorrow? I'm sure I am, Dad. I'm really happy about your dedication, Bobby. Dad, I've been thinking. What if I didn't go to Yale. What if I went to UCLA instead. All my friends are goin there and… Bobby, there isn't any ambition among your friends. You're going to go to Yale and make something of yourself. But UCLA has a terrific astronomy department. Bobby, looking through a telescope, isn't my idea of how to become successful. No, but it's a good way of becoming an astronomer. That's quite enough, Bobby. I know it's gonna be tough at Yale. But it's only under pressure that you find out what you're really made of. It's going to make a man out of you. Really. So stiffen your resolve. A good education is vital for getting you somewhere in this world. Let's not hear any more talk about UCLA or stargazing. Understand? - Sure, Dad. No more stargazing. - Drink your milk. To finish. Je finis, tu finis, il finit, nous finissons, vous finissez, ils finissent. Et finis. You are ready. No, no, Bobby. Hey, come on, I'm tense. I got to relax. Big game tomorrow, you know. See, that's just the point. I don't want you to do all your scoring in bed. I want you to get up… -come on- get a good night's sleep and score on your exam. And then? And then, we'll see. What happened? What did you get? Oh, Bobby tell me. - 91. - 91! Oh, that's great, 91. Eh, muchacho, ¿cómo está? 91! 91! ¡Arriba! ¡Muy bien! - Let's keep going. - You're crazy. No, I mean it. Let's go to San Francisco. I've got money. We can't go to San Francisco. Sure we can. Hey, I'm packing 132 dollars and 45 cents. I've already got reservations in Carmel. Bobby, you gotta go back. Too serious, huh? I just want to be alone with you for a couple of days. That's all. Is that so serious? People do it all the time. I have to get back to the house. I have a lot of loose ends to tie up before I go. Go? Go where? I'm going to visit my family in France. France? You haven't told me anything about France. When did this come about. I made the reservations last week and I'm leaving tomorrow. You're going to France? You never told me you're gonna leave me? Bobby, I'm not leaving you. I'm going away, that's all. - Same difference. - No. No. It's a very big difference. Yeah. Either way you're leaving me. Bobby, may I see you for a moment, please? Congratulations. The school just called. I'm very proud of you. Thanks, Dad. I now have the bittersweet obligation of having to pay Miss Green a bonus of 10,000 dollars. Terry gets 10,000 dollars because I passed? She didn't tell you? Maybe that's why she gave you such special attention all summer. People don't always do things for best of motives, do they. Bobby, sit down. There's more I want to say to you. That's okay. You said quite enough. - Listen to me. - No! You listen to me. All my life I've been listening to you. Now I've got something I want to say. Robert! I'm going to UCLA this fall, to stargaze. That's where you'll find me. Bobby, what happened? What did he say? Is it true that you get Ten thousand dollars Because I passed. That was your father's idea. He insisted on it. Not that you objected. That's how you got the ticket to France, right? Yes, But it has… - Why didn't you tell me? - Because It has nothing to do with it. Like hell it doesn't. God, I should have seen this coming all along. Why didn't you just talk to me at the beginning, huh? Then we could've made some kind of an arrangement. Like with a hooker! How can you say that to me? Bonnie. Bobby, what are you doing here? Bonnie, I have to talk with you. All right, I'll be right out. What's up? Bonnie, will you go to the movies with me on Saturday night? Bobby, you came over here at two o'clock in the morning to ask me to the movies? What do you expect me to do, telephone? Yeah, that's the way guys usually do it. - But the problem is I promised Biff… - Forget Biff. - Forget Biff? - He's through. Finished. - He is too old for you. - Too old? He's only twenty. Way too old. Why don't you pick on someone your own age? And who's that? Me for instance. Bobby, you know you're my good friend. I am… I'm sorry about what I said yesterday. I was stupid. I'm sorry that I hit you. I wish you would've shot me. So where were you last night. Everyone was so worried about you. I was over at Bonnie's. Yeah, I think it's time for me to go. Otherwise Bonnie is gonna have a big fight on her hands. So, it's off to France. You sure you don't want me to come along? Kind of like a translator. Help you with the tough words. I think I'm going to win this one on my own. I'm gonna forget you. No, you're not. No, I'm not. § I can hear the clock § § measuring ecstasy § § Every sound inside § § a touch § § I can hear the warm § § music of you and me § § It's the first time § § We made love § § The first time § § We made love §
