ROBERT: I'm sort of in between places right now. - PATTI: Yeah, me too. - ROBERT: Oh, yeah? I have a place to crash though, in Brooklyn. It's just a shitty room. It's somewhere, you know?

Pratt was just a way out of Floral Park because it was my dad's Alma mater. I've been drawing my whole life. Yeah? He an artist too? My dad? No, he's an engineer. He takes pictures, but he's no artist. [lighter flicks and scratches] Well, uh, I guess I got to get going. What? Where? You know... No. Stop. Don't go. You got a bed. Look, I'll take the couch. Don't go. Okay. Thanks. It's been rough. But I'll make it. I've been through worse. Had a feeling the moment I saw you. Like Mutt and Jeff, you know? Ricky and Lucy?

SANDY: Pull that out, and it's ready to go. - That's the focus? - Mm-hmm. And remember, it's always about the light. Whether you paint it or shoot it, you have to find it or make it.

It's one of the few photographs I own. How old are you? I'm 50. That too old for you? - No. It's good. - Yeah? Yeah. I'll never know what it's like to be 50. How are you so sure about that? - I just know. - Yeah? Are you scared of dying? Only before I'm famous. Well, then, you better get to work. So much to do, so little time. - Come on. - Oh, no, let's stay in bed. - Get up. Come on. - Please. Please. - I'll take you to the Met. - No. - Let's go.

Beautiful portraits. - My God, is that...? - Look at that. Is that Sarah Bernhardt? SAM: Yes, it is. ROBERT: She looks fantastic. I can't believe it's not a painting. You know? And there she is, forever. - Do you collect any? - No. They're not valuable. Well, you should. I think they will be. No, I think these will be up on the main floor with Rodin, Michelangelo, Mapplethorpe. SAM: Holy shit. These are gorgeous. Look at that. ROBERT: I know. I love that one. No one's blacks are blacker than yours. I swear to God. Wow, so many new men. You've become a bit of a collector yourself. Should I be concerned? No. They're my work. You're my love.

Of course. And can you give them this, please? Of course. And let yourself out, okay? Okay. ROBERT: Bye. Okay, bye. Okay, bye. Chin up. I want you to look directly at the camera. Perfect. [camera clicks] That's going to make a beautiful portrait, thank you. [gasps] These photographs are exquisite. - Yes, they are. - Precise. Uniquely scintillating. Thank you. But I can't put little Jesse McBride, Philip Glass and Arnold Schwarzenegger next to cocks and chains. I'd have to pass out Valium at the door. Show all of my work or none of it. I want to. You're brilliant. You're the Jekyll and Hyde of photography. But the public won't be able to handle it all at once, dear. My clients are only just beginning to grasp - that photography is art. - Yeah, um... see, Holly, Robert doesn't have a lot of patience for... - For anything. - Yeah... I have an idea of how Jekyll and Hyde can both have their debuts simultaneously. I'll call you. You're going to love it. - Can't wait. - Yeah. That's brilliant. Solomon. Kitchen. Very clever.

Well, you know, easing the public into it is an art in itself, apparently. Hey! So I thought, sell the public my flowers and then they can hang them on their walls without realizing what they're embracing. - WOMAN: Are you thrilled? - Are you coming to the kitchen? I am, yes!

Uh... [snorts] Yeah, that's okay. Wait there. Just... put your right leg out. Turn your body to your right. [camera clicks] Stop. I think I'm in love. - MILTON: I got to go. - ROBERT: No. You're perfect. I'm going to take care of you. TINA: Robert? Ed's here. Coming. TINA: The meeting your mother wanted me to set up. He's here. You want me to look at this? Thank you. Sit down. Of course, I'm... I'm still learning, but... some of them are good, right? They're all good. Just, look, I don't... I don't particularly want my kid brother working for me. But Dad kicked me out for wanting to take pictures for a living. Like you. - So... - Dad. Dad. Dad. Look, Edward, only when you cut him off are you going to be able to make the steps that you need to make to do something great with your life. I barely even know you, so... maybe. I don't want any connection to our family. You know, you just... you got to leave all of that stuff out of here, okay? Of course. - Do you understand that? - I understand. Okay. All right. Yeah? What time's the next shoot? TINA: Twelve o'clock, Robert. What time is it now? TINA: Just after 11:00. Want to do some cocaine? Straight from God. [laughs] [sniffs] Come on. [snorts] - [coughs] - There you go. - [laughs] - [coughing] [sniffing and snorting] [coughing] Okay, let's see. Oh, yeah. I love it. Yeah, this one. Burn it a little. TOM: I don't know, man. ROBERT: It's brilliant, don't you think? Aw, come on. Yeah, the only thing you need to know is where the darkroom is. You come in, get the film, go print, and you go home. - Okay? - [sighs] Crop it. Take off his head. It's stronger without it. [camera clicks and cranks] Move. Curator. Can you define it? A guy who chooses art pieces for other folks to check out. Ugh! Where's Edward? Ed. I think we need to get your English teacher to focus on the language of the arts. This isn't... I don't know what's going on here. I can't... you know, it's this thing here. Here we are. Look at you. You look so innocent. You're my beautiful black boy. I'm going to put it back in. You're going to do great. - [camera clicks] - Bingo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Playboy. Yeah. Yeah. Can I stick my finger in your ass? Who's a good boy? [grunts] Wrap it over your shoulders. Like that. Yeah. Uh... I just... I don't know. I can't see the frame. I can't see the fucking frame. Sorry, Lisa. Just give me... I just need a moment. [sniffs] Chin up. Tense. [coughs and retches] [spits] No time for this. It's so empty in here. Why? Why? Why did you sell your photography collection, Sammy? SAM: Sentimentality is the kiss of death in art. You know that. It's too much stuff. Let somebody else take care of it. Besides, I'm really enjoying this. I can shine these spots away. Gives me a little hope. [chuckles] Only $500. For everything. All these pieces. It's unbelievable. I bet you this is the next big thing. I've got it, by the way. - How do you know? - I know. I'm just waiting for the test results. - That doesn't mean that you... - Oh, Robert. Robert. I wake up every night covered in sweat. Well, so open your fucking window. It has arrived. Have you been tested? No. Monkey, please. I won't. [sighs] Your photos are quickly becoming a gallery of the dead. [paper rustling and ripping] Hey. What... what are you... What are you doing? What... Milton, what's wrong? Whoa, whoa, take it ea... What are you doing? Milton, stop it. Stop it. What are you doing? I love you. Love me? - Yeah. - You don't love me. You don't love anyone. You love yourself. And how you make people do shit. You make me do shit. Read crap I don't get. Take it easy. And you call me nigger in bed. Milton, come on, that's just a tease. It's not meant as an insult. I thought... I thought you liked... Poor nigger who poses like a nude piece a black meat for his pansy boyfriend. - Fuck you! - Whoa, take it easy. Okay, Milton, I was trying to enlighten you. To celebrate you. To celebrate your strength. To celebrate your beautiful black flesh. I'm not one of your white boy, stuck-up sculptures. And I sure enough ain't nobody's nigger. All right. Milton... Milton. Milton, you have been the subject of some of my best work. You are the star. - Milton. - You took pictures of my dick sticking out of my pants. Because it's gorgeous. Milton... You picked the wrong poor black boy for your collection. Don't go. Where are you going to go? Come on, I need you. - You got everything you need. - No. - I need money. - No, Milton. Please. Well, you know where it is. Don't... Look, let's talk. Milton. Milton. Fuck. [glass tinkling] What do you guys think? That one. ROBERT: Yeah, that's amazing, Sam. Really. Another $25,000. My biggest sale yet. [coughs] Dead man walking. Who knew my stock would rise with every pound I lose? What are... what are these doing here? I thought you might take a look at them. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Why? You don't need my opinion. You've got my moves down. Hey, that's not what I'm trying to do. Plus, you're the technical expert. Yeah, but, I... I want your opinion about the art. Because? Because you're my brother, and because, well, you're better at this than I am. Yeah, well, you know, I actually have no idea how my pictures look so good. It's not something I can just pass on to you. Well, can you at least tell me which ones you like the best? Why? I have to pick one for the group show. Next month. What? The one you're in, too. [chuckles] So if we're going to continue working together, you got to change your last name. I have made Mapplethorpe a name through my hard work over the years. I mean, it just... here, how about... Mom's maiden name. Maxey. Yeah. Look at that. It sounds sexy. Use it. Look, I'm sorry, Edward. I feel like I've done a lot for you. But I've got to draw the line. You can't just keep riding on my coattails. This batch here needs your technical expertise. I'm going out. EDWARD: You can't keep doing this, Robert. ROBERT: Doing what? Don't you care about spreading it? Well, you know, that's up to them, not me. I can't cheat death, but I can cheat life, which I won't. - Robert... - We're born and die alone. - Robert, you're not alone. Spend our lives pretending we're not. If I have to change the way I live, then I'd rather not at all, okay? Hey, I'm just paying my dues. He's not letting any of us off easy. Technical expertise, Edward. EDWARD: Robert! - [billiard balls clack] - [funky music playing] Look at them. They're just superior. Smooth, you know? Muscular shoulders. Mm-mm-mm. Cock. Excuse me. [inaudible] Thanks. Let's see. Take a shot. [billiard balls clack] [sighs] I'm not that great at this. Hey. Come on, let's go. - Where? - My place. Let's go. ROBERT: Hug your knees closer to you. A bit tighter. Hug them more. That's good. Now hold that. Perfect. Chin up. Thank you. Stop. [camera clicks] Got it. Thank you. Well done. Thank you. Jesus Christ. I mean, thank God that is over. So, I'm going to go out. But I can drop you at the hotel and then I'll meet you at the airport in the morning. I'm not coming, Robert. What, you don't need a ride? No, I mean, I'm not coming to New York. I've thought about it a lot, and I need to... I need to have my own career, Robert. So I'm heading down to Los Angeles. [sighs] All right, what? You're my assistant. That's your career. You owe me. I gave you a life. No, I don't owe you. I've given you everything I have. - Oh, well thank you. - Robert, I have this much. This much. I need to start my own life as Edward Maxey. - Yeah. - Hmm? - Edward Maxey. - Well, good luck with that. Whatever delusions of grandeur you have, you're an assistant. Get in the car. [sighs] Come here. I've had three great loves in my life. My mom. Art. And you. I hope not in that order. [laughs weakly] [coughs] ANNOUNCER: [on TV] And now for your update on Things About Town. Mapplethorpe Mania has arrived in New York in the form of a retrospective exhibition that opens July 28th at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Oh. Bravo, Martin. These are the deepest blacks I have ever seen. MARTIN: Someone came by yesterday and they thought these two were paintings. I know. Well, that's the idea. And your canvas seals the deal. You're going to be famous for this. They are the holy grail of platinum printing. Now, let's wrap Thomas and Dovanna in white silk. Regal, you know? So everybody knows to worship. And let's wrap Donald in rich red silk. And we got to have a cock in the show. I mean, people will be expecting some cock. [coughs and hacks] Thank you. Thank you, Martin. Amazing work. I mean, look. Can you make your legs into a V? Yeah. Hold that. Okay, could you just dip your neck. Hold. Maybe try putting your arms straight out in front of you. Perfect. Hold that. Ha! It's my baby brother. We're just photographing this beautiful bronze sculpture. Robert, I thought about what you said. Oh, Edward, meet Javier. He's my new assistant. He was just a Spanish street urchin, but he's very ambitious, and he's learning fast. - Hi. - Mucho gusto. Oh, yeah, he doesn't speak much English. But he's got a dictionary, so it shouldn't take you long to train him. You know what, Ken? Let's... Can I photograph you by the dining room, please? [snorts] Okay, can you make sure you put this with the whole Wasting series. [coughs and hacks] It'll be valuable when I'm gone. Oh, my... Father Stack. Robert. You're a long way from Floral Park. I'm glad to see you. Do they speak to you? - [coughs] - Well... it's a battle between good and evil. Are you here for my confession, Father? No. Your mother asked me to come. She's worried about you. How is she? Not very well. Her emphysema has really worsened. Sit down. Please. [Robert coughs] Robert... do you believe in God? No. What gives you solace? Beauty. Perfection. Knowing that I've captured those things in my work. Knowing that my work will outlive me. It'll still be there when I'm gone. And you have... Thank you. That's what I see. Even that which we deem obscene, you make look more beautiful than I thought possible. I wonder what it's like to be your subject. My subject? I remember my first communion with you. - Can you remember that? - I remember that. - Yes. - [laughs] Oh, perfect. - Thank you, Father. - You're a rascal. - I remember that. - [laughs] - [camera clicks] - Did I blink? Sorry. Oh, you look absolutely heavenly, Father. And if you could just look off to my left, please. Just a touch. The devil is in all of us, Father. I wonder where he is in you. [camera clicks] I think we got it. [crowd shouting] WOMAN: Robert! I love you! [applause] Thank you for coming. The first time I came to this museum, they wouldn't let me in because I didn't have a buck. But I always remember these lights. - JANET: Robert. - Hello. I'm curating the ICA exhibition, and I wanted to follow up with you on my idea of a traveling exhibition of your work. - Oh. - So, the entire range of your work would be represented at once. Finally. From your most hard-core imagery, to the most delicate flowers. They are delicate, but not sweet. They're New York flowers. [clears throat] They have a black edge to them. So we'll open in Philadelphia, and then it'll be Chicago, Washington, D.C., and finally, Cincinnati. Cincinnati. Poor Cincinnati. Impossible to spell, and starts with the word "Cin." [laughs] Well, that sounds, yeah, very interesting. - Thank you. - Thank you. - I'll be in touch with you. - All right. Have I met her? Hmm. Thought so. Oh, what I would give for a hot dog. Oh, Robert, I don't know if that's a good idea. Come on. Like the old days. You haven't eaten solid food in months. Roman, would you mind stopping the car, please? No. Yeah, I got it. I'm all right. It's all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. You got it? - Got it? - I got it. Okay. - Do you got it? - [laughs] I'm all right. I'm all right. - I'll be right back. - All right. - All right. - Thanks. Hot dog. - You got it? - Yeah. [sighs] Mm. Don't crash So good. [coughs] [retching] [footsteps] [sighs] [coughs] Hey, Angel. Hey. [sobs] Come on, Soakie. It's okay. It's going to be okay. What is that? [sighs] It appeared when my son was born. Oh. You're getting old. I told my parents, remember, we... we got married in a... in a strawberry field in California. - And we were. - Yeah. Anything you dreamed was real. [sighs] [door opens] Oh. Those are ugly. You can toss them. Don't you want to know who they're from first? Not really. Okay, it says... I thought Mom was sick? No? EDWARD: She is. What, do you think Dad sent these? EDWARD: He must have. NURSE: Want to keep them? Yeah. It's like the nicest thing he's ever done for me. Thank you. [door closes] Who knew Dad had such terrible taste in flowers? [laughs] Right? Where do you want them? Sorry for the mix-up. The flowers are for the patient across the hall. I'm sorry. [laughs] [Robert hacks and coughs] Hey. Hey. Edward, I'm scared. I know. How was the show? It was good. Did you sell anything? A few. See? Told you, you don't need to be a Mapplethorpe. You can make it on your own, right? Sure. Can I see your work? Okay. All right. I think... you'll really appreciate this. [sighs] ROBERT: Sammy. Sam. Take the picture.
