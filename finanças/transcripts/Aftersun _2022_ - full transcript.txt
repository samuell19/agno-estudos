Oh, oh. What's that? Oh, my God, what even is that? These are my moves. Dad, that's so embarrassing. That's not embarrassing. Wait... DAD: What? I was gonna interview you. Oh, you were, were you? What were you gonna interview me about? I don't know. - Well... - Well... I just turned 11. And you are 130, turning 131 in two days. So... when you were 11, what did you think you would be doing now? - I love you. - Love you. Bye. Hiya, everyone. My name's Belinda, and I'll be your tour rep for the next week or two. Now I've only just transferred in from Torremolinos... Oh! From Torremolinos! Right, well, I, uh... I hope I'll be a good help to you here in Turkey... - "Hiya." - all the same. Uh, now, we've got seven stops tonight... "My name's Belinda..." so bear with us, all right? "and I've just come in from Torremolinos." Torremolinos. Torremolinos. Torremolinos. - Hang tight, poppet, okay? - Okay. I'm fine. Someone's coming. - Time for bed? - No. Hello? It's, um, 501. Mmm, yeah, that's us. Yeah, um, I booked a room with two beds, but we've only got the one here. Yeah, okay, well, I paid for it and, um, it was confirmed by the travel agency. Okay, that's all you can do? Okay. Scootch under. There we go. Yeah. Oh, it'll have to be then. Okay, thanks. Mmm, goodnight. Goodnight. Digital video entertainment. Don't get that wet, Soph. It was expensive. Sorry about the hotel. Clive was just here and he said he had a great time. Everything okay at home? What do you mean? I mean, how are you and your mom getting along? Yeah, okay, I guess. Good. I'm glad. Why, what did she tell you? She didn't say anything. You just told me you weren't getting along that well last time I saw you. Remember? I can't exactly ask you when I phone you at home. Oh, yeah, right. Things have been better. Good. Why don't you go over and introduce yourself? Dad, no. They're, like, kids. Mmm-hmm. Why don't you go over and introduce yourself? Hmm, Sophie, they're, like, old. Huh. See, if you let it rest on an object for a wee while, it gets the lighting right. That's quite clever. You want a massive ice-cream? Yeah, that's bigger than my head. That's impossible. You have a massive head. - Are you done? - What? That's a bit rude. No, it's not. It's just a fact. Your head's bigger than mine. I... I... I would disagree with that fact. Look at the size of it. Your head's bigger. See? Say hello to your mom. That's all you're going to give her? - Love you. - Say you miss her. I miss you. And what? And bye-bye. And your dad's being amazing. And what? And my dad's being amazing. Why is your dad being amazing? Because he's taking so much... Uh-huh. Well, what did she say? Oh, I'll do it when I'm home. School doesn't start until Thursday, right? Okay. Yeah, it's good. We're not actually at our hotel. But ours doesn't have a phone, so... Dad? He's good. Oh, my God, he's doing some weird slow-motion ninja moves. Why is he so weird sometimes? But, yeah, he's good. All right. Love you. Bye. - Mom wants to talk to you. - What? - Mom wants to talk to you. - Right. Thanks, poppet. Hey. Checking up on me? So, are you gonna do anything? What do you mean? With George. He told Seb he wanted to. With you, I mean. Not Seb, obviously. Last night on the way home, I gave Kenny... Literally in the bushes behind the other pool. Well, like, what happened? What do you mean? Did he come? Yeah. I mean, obviously. You should wear your hair back sometimes. You look really pretty with your hair back. Oh, my God, do you think she heard us? Who cares? She's literally, like, nine. That's wonderful. Yeah. Yeah, I'm so happy for you. All right, love you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, will do. Okay. Bye. Hey. Do you know how to play? It's that one to start. I know. Come on, start your engines. Game over. Round one. - Do you want to play again? - Right, Soph, we're up. - Bye. - Bye. There you go. Right, you ready? Right. There you go. - You don't mind, do you, mate? - No bother. Right, last one for now, then, okay? Do you want a game of doubles? Yeah, sure. You've got a built-in rest there. No danger. I'm right-handed and I'm playing with a kid, right? Go easy. - Do you want to break or... - Yeah. Good. Well done. So, what's your sister's name? Uh, Sophie. Oh, nice. I'm her dad, though, actually. Oh. Sorry, mate, I just thought... That's okay. It's a nice hotel, eh? Oh, yeah, it's all right. I mean, we're staying in that one over the road, basically a building site, so... Olly. Fucking hell, Sophie. Impressive. Hey, don't say... "Fuck". - Oh, sorry, mate... - That's okay. Well done. Right, I'm up. You watching? No! Move it. No! That's it, move it! - No. - No! You want to ruin it again for everybody, as usual. No! Twist. No, keep your... I'm not letting you off. Go again. No, you're just pushing. Look, you have to twist. Like, here. Okay? Again. No. Okay, grab my wrists. Okay, okay, I get it. So, the thin part lines up to where the fingers connect, okay? - Okay. Mmm-hmm. - Are you looking? And then you pull as hard as you can, - like that, okay? - Ow. No, this is serious, Sophie. Look at me. It's important you get this. Go. No. You're not twisting. You're just pulling. - Okay, again. - I can't twist. Look, grab my wrists. Thin part lines up to where the fingers connect. Okay? And you pull as hard as you can. Okay. This is serious, Sophie. It's important you get this. So that you can defend yourself. So that if anyone ever tries to attack you, you can break free and get away. What if someone tries to attack me some other way? Without grabbing my wrists? I think it's nice that we share the same sky. What do you mean? Well, like, sometimes at playtime I look up to the sky and if I can see the sun, then I think about the fact that we can both see the sun. So, even though we're not actually in the same place, and we're not actually together, we kind of are in a way, you know? Like, we're both underneath the same sky, so... we're kind of together. One. Head under. Two, three, four, - four and a half... What? - Stop, stop. Can we do that? Hmm? You're too young, poppet. Ladies and gentlemen, the marvelous, wonderful, amazing, one-armed, Calum Aaron Patterson. Getting ready to see the evening entertainment. And... We'll see... Torremolinos! Are you okay, Soph? You've not mentioned Claire. Hmm? Um... Remember she had a boyfriend when we first met? Yup. I was, like, "Who's that on the phone?" And you were, like, "Oh, just this girl I like, "but she's already going out with someone." Yeah, well, they got back together. Aw, I liked her. Mmm-hmm. Me, too. So, does that mean you're not gonna open the cafe? Cafe? Uh, no. Not anymore. But I've got this new thing going with Keith. And what is it? Well, we're still figuring it out exactly, but we're thinking of renting a house a wee bit outside London to work from. You'd have your own room for when you come down. Yes. Can I paint it yellow? Yellow? Why yellow? I like the idea of a yellow room. But Mom doesn't let me paint my room yellow. You're trying to get me into trouble. Well, can I, though? Aye, we'll see. Right, let's watch this. Room number? Soph, did you bring your wallet? No? No? Okay. Grab this. Do not look at him. When I count to three, we're gonna throw it at the stage and leave. You understand? Now! Quick! Go! Sophie, run! Run, run, run! Did it hurt? When you fell? - When I broke my wrist? - Uh-huh. I don't know. I don't really remember. Um, I didn't think it was broken, and I'd never broken anything before. I've never broken anything before. Hmm. How come you and Mom say, "Love you"? What? Like, on the phone. You're not together, so why would you say it? Well... think of all the people you say it to. Like, Nana, Granddad, uncles, aunties, right? Yeah, but they're, like, family. Well, your mother is family. I remember one time, I asked Mom if she'd phoned you. And she said that you were engaged. Like, I didn't know why, but I thought that meant that you were getting married, like, both of youse. Like, I didn't know if I thought that about just you or both of you, but... Isn't that funny? Well, I didn't know what it meant at the time. I didn't know that it meant that you were just on the phone to somebody else. I was kind of excited. About us getting married? Yeah, I was really young, though. Like... I don't know, like, seven. How are you getting on with the book? You enjoying it? Yeah, it's a bit hard to understand, though. Stick with it. I think you'll really like it. What does "municipal" mean? A proper dive, Soph. I told you, I can't. You were diving last year. No, I wasn't. Here. - Pass me my mask. - I did. What? Come on, Soph, stop messing around. I'm not messing around. You know I didn't see you throw it. Throw what? The mask. I know it was expensive. That's okay, darling. It's fine. I'm just a little tired today, that's all. Can you run up and grab the camera? It's in the bag. Here... Put that on your foot, then try again. On my foot? Yeah, put it on. It's gonna be much easier. - Do you need help? - Yeah, please. Thanks. There we go. - Thank you. - That's a trick of the trade. It's not a bad trade. No, not at all. Is this what you do all year round, then? You sound like my anneanne, my mother's mum. - Your grandma? - Yeah. She would prefer that I had a proper job. What is your shoe size? Uh, ten. - Ten. - Forty-four? Forty-four. CALUM: Yes. - I think these should fit. - Yeah. You know, I used to travel a lot. One season somewhere, next season somewhere else, but now I'm here. Back home. And do you miss it? - Travelling? - Aye. Not as much as I was missing home, to be honest. And I'm going to have a baby soon. Congratulations. Yeah. A few years ago, I thought I would be at least 40 before all that, but... I can't see myself at 40, to be honest. Surprised I made it to 30. My name is Sophie Lesley Patterson reporting live from... I don't know the name of this boat. Um, but, basically, I have just went and done the most amazing thing in my whole entire life. So, we went, like, scuba diving thing. And there was actually, like, a sea horse and it wrapped round my, like, whole finger. Then when I got out, there was an octopus, and the instructor person, I don't know, like, yeah, instructor put it on, put an octopus on my head. A real life octopus on my head. Yeah, but right now... Dad... I mean, Calum Aaron Patterson is away on some scuba diving thing, I think. I can't remember. But, yeah, he doesn't actually have a diving licence, 'cause he told a porky pie. But, yeah, he'll be fine, yeah. He'll be fine, I'm sure. But, yeah, bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. What's that? What? Uh, that's just another kind of smoking, - and smoking causes... - Smoking causes cancer, and puts tar in your lungs and makes your teeth all yellow, and causes your eyeballs to fall out. We'll go somewhere else next time. It's not that bad. When was the last time you went to see Nana? Hmm. Right. Trouble... So, watch again, okay? - Okay. Let's see. - Okay? Right, that was a bad start. When are you back at school? Thursday. - Next week? - Crazy. God, I thought it was a bit later. Who's your new teacher? Miss Mackel. Aye, the one from Glasgow? How do you know that? What? She's pretty. She's the pretty one from Glasgow. She stuck in my head. Oh, my God, Dad, stop! - Okay. - Stop. Is she supposed to be good? We done a crossover at the end of term. Seems all right. Insert coin. - Insert coin. - You playing? Dad's gone to get money. Here, watch this. Insert coin. 10p. Got another? I'm Michael, by the way. Well, you better have been practicing, Michael. Harsh. What's your name, then? Sophie. - Game over. - Are you joking? That's 1-1. I didn't know we were keeping count. Yes, you did. You okay through there? I don't know. I guess. I just feel a bit down or something. What do you mean? I don't know. Don't you ever feel like... you've just done a whole amazing day, and then you come home and feel tired and down, and it feels like your bones don't work? They're just tired and everything is tired. Like you're sinking. I don't know. It's weird. Well, we're here to have a good time, eh? Ready? Yup. Right, we'll go get a nice dinner, and we'll get an early night, yeah? Yes. CALUM: Let's go. Come on. Don't you think this one's lovely? - Yeah. It is, actually. - Hmm. Yeah, the man was telling me that each of these carpets tells a different story. Like, the symbols and motifs, they represent different things. Oh. Tes... sekkur ederim. Tesekkur ederim. - What? - Tesekkur ederim. Tesekkur ederim. Tesekkur ederim. - Tesekkur ederim. - Tesekkur ederim. - Oh! - You see? Uh, how much is this one? This one is 45 million Turkish Lira. Yeah, and what's that in pounds? Sorry. £850. Okay. - Thanks. - You're welcome. You gonna play pool? No, no, come on. Why don't you go introduce yourself to those girls over there? She can come and play pool with us if she wants. I mean, there's only three of us, so play a couple of games of doubles. She's a bit young, isn't she? Yeah, but she's good at it. She's better than him. Dad? Yeah, okay, go on, then. An hour and then you come right back. Okay? Okay. Take your time, girls. What's that? Uh, it's an all-inclusive thing, so you can get as much as you want of anything. That's it? It's the same thing. Well, well, well, look who it is. No, this side, innit, mate. Oi, oi. Whoa, whoa, you don't want to see that. Oi, corrupting the youth. You don't want to see that. There you go, your receipt. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Thank you. Gross. They've been snaking for a fucking age. What? What the fuck is snaking? Snaking. Why, what do you call it? That? That's tonguing. No, that's nipping. - Nipping. - Oi. What we'll do, yeah, is go over there and push 'em in. You get him, I'll get her. Yeah. Push 'em in. You get him, I'll get her over there. - Yeah. - Let's go. Go. Come on. You get him, I'll get her. Push him. Yeah? Wait, I want a go. Oh, my God. Okey-dokey. This is our room. Mmm-hmm. And this is Dad's tiny-weeny-weeny bed. This is my giant bed. Um... Wait, wait, wait. How do I zoom? Let's see. Pass it here. Hmm. It's this button here, see? Oh, my God, I'm on TV. How do I look? Okey-dokey, give that back. Oh. Oh, oh, oh. What's that? Oh, my God, what even is that? These are my moves. Dad, that's so embarrassing. That's not embarrassing. Wait. CALUM: What? I was gonna interview you. Oh, you were, were you? What were you gonna interview me about? I don't know. Well... Well, I just turned 11. And you are 130, turning 131 in two days. So... when you were 11, what did you think you would be doing now? Hello? What did you think you would be doing now? Come on, Soph. Turn that off now, okay? Okay, it's off. Well, I can see a red light. That... That's just because it's still on. Mmm-hmm. Look, it's not even on you anymore. It's on me. Dad. Okay, it's not recording. I'll just record it in my little mind camera. Right. Ready? What did you do for your 11th birthday? When I was 11, nobody remembered it was my birthday. And when I told my mom, she was so angry, she grabbed me by the ear, and made my dad drive me to the toy shop, and made me pick something to buy. That's a bit, um, deep. It's okay. What did you pick? I chose a toy phone. It was red. - Good choice. - Thank you. Want a sip? Nice? Yeah, it tasted amazing. Think you'll ever move back to Scotland? No. Why? There's not enough sun. Very funny. Hmm, it's all in the past for me, that's all. And there's this feeling, once you leave where you're from, like, where you grew up, that, um, you don't totally belong there again. Not really. But Edinburgh was never... I never felt like I really did belong there. I do. It's home. That's good. I'm glad you feel that way. But you never know where you'll end up, though, eh? You can live wherever you want to live. Hmm. Be whoever you want to be. You have time. It's okay. Right, top up time. No, no, I'll do it. How's that working? Let me help, come on. No, Soph, scootch back. Lift your hair a sec. There you go. Let's do something, eh? Get this day going. Like what? Water polo? No, I'm not a good enough swimmer for that.

Good night. Good night. Hey. Are you okay? Yeah. Happy birthday, Sophie. I'll get him. Hello? Your wake up call, sir. Okay, thanks. Day trip leaves in 20 minutes. Thank you. Sophie. Sophie. Sophie, come on, let's get up, it's time to go. Careful with those. A man died not paying attention to how to put those on properly. End of the lug went up right up his nose and punctured his brain. - That's not true. - It is. Happy birthday, Dad. Thanks, darling. Okay. You're copying me? All right, smartarse. Attention! Oh, what's this we're doing? Yeah, tricked you. I'm still copying you, though. I know. Exactly. And now copy this. Breathe. Right, are you watching? - Yeah. - Feet together. Up. Up and down. Up...

If it's good enough for Cleopatra... It's kind of amazing how Cleopatra was, like, here. Like, right here. Yeah. Before she was... By a snake. Well, I mean, it was kind of suicide. It wasn't for sure that it was a snake. Nobody ever found a snake, so... It might have just been a needle or something. How do you know that? We learned about Egypt last term. What happened to your shoulder? I don't really know. I'm sorry I passed out on your bed. It's fine. I didn't have a key, though. How'd you get in? Reception. I'm so sorry, Soph. Yesterday was...

This boy, Michael. I met him on the motorbike game. Yeah. We... We kissed last night. He kissed me, and then we kissed. He's your age, though? Yeah. Well, that's okay, right? A peck on the cheek? Well, yeah, not exactly. Okay. You know, I want you to know that you can talk to me about anything. As you get older, you know. Whatever parties you go to, boys you meet, drugs you take. - Dad! - No, I'm serious, Soph. I've done it all and you can too. I just want you to promise me that you'll talk to me about it, okay? Okay. But I'm never gonna do any of that, anyway. Well, that's okay, too. But if you do, remember, okay? On the count of three we're gonna sing. It's my dad's birthday. It's my dad's birthday...
