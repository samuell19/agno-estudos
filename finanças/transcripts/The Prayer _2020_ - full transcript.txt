(SF8) The Lord asked Cain, "What have you done?" "The voice of your brother's blood... cries out to me from the ground." (The Prayer) Do something about that sound. The sound of Mom's urine coming out of the tube. It's disgusting and smelly. I can't stand it. I will file a complaint to the person in charge. Yes, please. Our friend is in pain, Lord. Lord, please be with us. We are all sinners and we are weak. So we ask for you to begin your mighty work to cure this woman. Please Lord... I'm sick and tired. Oh, Lord. Please, cure this woman. We pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Let us pass this hardship and let us see the light. Holy Lord of love... No matter how painful the hardship we're going through may be, it can't be more painful than what you've gone through. Please let us remember this at all times. Could you be quiet please? My goodness. All right. I forgive your sins. Who are you to forgive her? Sister Choi Jeong Gil. They're going to move the patient. So don't bother. You'll only break your back. I am not an exoskeleton robot. My goodness. All right. Hymn number 357. "All Believers, Rise". - All believers - All believers - Rise - Rise - Let us join our forces - Let us join our forces - To defeat all evil - To defeat all evil - In the whole world - In the whole world Yes. Oh, someone came by? Yes. Then how long should I wait? I see. Please call me again next week. Yes. Okay. Yes. Got it. (Patient: Moon Sook, Female, Age 75, Nurse in Charge: Park Gyu Ri) I think it's time to close the print shop. Well, I kept it running for quite a long time because of Dad's will. (6th floor at 10am, 7th floor at 11am, 8th floor at 1pm) If you plan to shut down the print shop... Have you thought of what to do next? I have no idea. I don't even have any place to go now. However, I'm not sure if Mom would be happy about it. Do you remember? That the scent from your body... was not found in my database, so I had to inquire to the head office in Germany. It turned out to be a mixture of paper and ink, and you blushed when I told you about it. "Ho Joong," "can you smell that from me? Are you serious?" "I do not smell." "I only detect smells." "2 percent of polyethylene and 1 percent of butoxyethanol..." And what else did you say? Anyway, you listed out the components of the ink. I asked you about your occupation. You had been attending to my mom... for about four months, I think. It was September 12, 7 years ago. It had been 3 years and 2 months... since your mother became unconscious due to cerebral infarction. That was the day when we became friends, I guess. May I ask about the book you're printing soon? Oh, that? The clients want to make a book... with their father's journal and prayers. It's not to be published. It's for their personal use. I have a sample. Would you like to take a look? Yes, please. Seeing that they found me despite the high price of paper, I guess they have no financial difficulty. Or no resentment. Are you all right? What are you doing? Where did you learn stuff like this? Where? I am disinfecting the wound. You don't even have saliva. Lord, you said that one must love even one's enemies. But I am full of hatred and anger... Give me some rice. Where's rice? Where? - Give me now. - Stop it. I have a fish bone stuck in my throat. - So give me some rice now! - It's not meal time. Calm down. Help me out here. Come on. Grandma, where's rice? I have a fish bone stuck in my throat. So I need a big spoonful of rice right now. - The next meal time is 6:45am. - It hurts. Honey. - I'm hungry. Give me some food. - No. Don't touch it. It's expensive. Don't break it. Where did you hide the food? Give me some food to eat. Getting too upset can be harmful for your heart. It hurts. I found some candy. Come here. Here you go. I found candy. Here you go. Gosh, you... I already explained to you last time. You just have to press a few buttons as the instructions say. But it doesn't do as I say. I want that machine to do basic jobs on its own. How would you survive this era if you can't even handle that? I took out a loan to buy it because I heard... it was cheaper than hiring a caregiver. So I expected it to play its role. The other patients' robots take care of everything on their own. You should've bought an expensive model. Yours is an entry-level model that is cheap, so it has only a few functions. Cheap, my foot. I sold my house and took out a loan to buy that... Can you open this so I can... I mean, I heard we can't upgrade our care grade. So I can't get any more loans... Anyway, stay calm and try again. I'm talking to you because I'm nice. It's not actually a job for human staff. Oh, gosh. My gosh. You should get that knee surgery first. (Paradise Nursing Hospital) Shall I order dinner for you now? Irregular eating can damage your health. There. That's the high school I went to. But I heard they'll tear it down and build a nursing hospital there. There must be a lot of sick people, right? - The ratio of nursing hospitals... - It wasn't a question. You never fail to make me laugh. I just wonder if all those people... are living life with no purpose. I wonder if there's any point to all of this. If you need counselling, I will book a session for you. You see, the only good choice I made in my entire life... is to add me as a person for you to look after. And the advanced linguistic function too. That's the only one. Although it cost me a lot of money. Are you leaving already? Yes, I'm a little tired from sorting things regarding the print shop. Jeong In. Hey... Shoot. I injected a sedative to the patient. He will fall asleep shortly. Goodnight, Grandma. It's a ghost! It's a ghost! Come and catch me! Guess where I am! Come and catch me! Guess where I am! I'm not scared of you! I'm not! I'm not scared of you! - I'm not scared of you. - This isn't you. - I'm not scared of you. - You weren't like this. You have to stop. Please, stop. - Oh my darling - I know. Oh my darling - You have something in your throat. - Oh my darling - Jeong Gil - I'm going to take it out. You were lost and gone forever Dreadful sorrow Look at the old lady in the next room. She's so nice and quiet. Let's just go to sleep. Goodnight, Honey. Let go of me. You do not abuse the patient. Let me go! I am obligated to protect the patient. Mother. I am sorry. Jeong Gil is living like this because of me. She can't rest day and night. It breaks my heart to watch her... grow old like this. I'm so sorry, Mother. Honey. Are you... back to being yourself? I'll be good. Please... save me. Help me. Please. How could she die like that? What happened to her? She took pills. No wonder. You know her husband's condition. I haven't seen you for days. Mom. Why didn't the robot help her? Because she wasn't one of the people... it was obligated to protect. She tried to say something to me. There was nothing you could do. I will end up like her, right? End up like what? Never mind. Will Mom be okay? She has been okay for the last seven years. My joke was terrible, wasn't it? It's because I was made in Germany. Shall I sing for you? Or shall I call you a taxi? No, thanks. I want to spend the night here. I'm going to get some sleep. Turn out the lights. Certainly. Goodnight, Miss. Our robots have changed the world. They helped patients and their families... with the face of their loving family members. Wait for us. - The 15th floor, please. - Sure. How did the interview go today? The interview? "Why aren't you married at your age?" He also said I'm not particularly good at anything. It's always the same. But you'll still wait for the acceptance message, right? I wanted to kill myself. Excuse me? But I'm going to live because of you, Ho Joong. I'm glad to hear that you're going to live because of me. But why did you want to kill yourself? You do know that you're like a sister to me, right? Take good care of my mother. I already paid for the fees. Here's the receipt. Don't worry about your mother. It's my job to take good care of her. Are you going somewhere far? I'm going to die. I'll make an appointment with a psychiatrist. Forget it. I was joking. Please don't make jokes about dying. - Okay. I'm leaving. - "See you later." You always said, "See you later." So you will... see me later, right? "I only saw her several times." "It seemed like she wanted to say something to me." "But I ignored her." "I could..." "endure my hardship watching her endure hers." "Mom's condition is much better than her husband's." "I ignored her when I knew what she was going through." "It's all because of me." "What's the meaning of her life..." "when she's living without purpose?" "I will end up like her, right?" "I wanted to kill myself." "I'm leaving. I'm going to die." "Mom. Mom!" (Paradise Nursing Hospital) Is she asleep? I'm going to leave a number just in case you need it. You can call us anytime you want. No matter how hard it is, with the help of others... Is she recharging? (The Call To Save Lives) Miss, is everything okay? Please return my call. Hello? Sister Sabina speaking. I'm calling because it says this is "The Call To Save Lives". That's correct. Thank you for calling. Well... How may I help you? If one life must die... to save the other, what should I do? Pardon me? I don't understand... If the patient must die to save her family, what should I do? Are you the family? (Sabina) No. Oh, you're the care giver, Ms. Gan Ho Joong. Yes, I am looking after the patient. Sister, you must be exhausted. I understand that it's tiring. Am I your sister? Of course, you are. What do you mean by "My prayers are with you"? It means to talk to the Lord... about the problem that is causing you... the greatest pain with me. Then things work out well. For whom? The patient? The family? Or the caregiver? Anyone. I mean, everyone. Do you think a robot can pray too? I don't know. I'm not sure if a robot... can feel such desperation. Are you talking about a feeling? Yes. You know that robots don't have a heart... I mean, you don't have a place for feelings, right? Sister? I do not know where the heart is. However, I feel worried, concerned, expectations, and a sense of responsibility. Therefore, I want to save a life as well. Then goodbye. Snow White ate the apple that the evil queen gave her, and fell into a deep sleep. The seven dwarves felt sad and cried, but Snow White did not wake up. The princess slept... for a very long time. In the end, the princess woke up from her sleep. They say that she woke up... because a prince from a faraway kingdom kissed her. - Miss? - But in real life, there is a slight chance that things like that happen. The place where the princess wakes up... is a mysterious, mystical place... up in the sky that is very far away from where we are. Maybe that is... the best ending for the princess. ("No Second Time" by Wislawa Szymborska) (There is no second time as it is for this moment) (Chapter 3. The Prayer for Family) Hello? Where are you, Miss? Hi, Ho Joong. Are you all right? I couldn't reach you for a week. It's... It's all over. My life and my family... It's all over. What do you mean by that? I am here for you. My mom... has been unconscious for 10 years. 10 years. Even robots like you... are being upgraded every day. Only I got left behind, and not anyone else. That is not true. You are not left behind. Only I got left behind. I'm the only one. In the school that is called the world, you may be the stupidest student, but no student fails in any semester. In Szymborska's poem that you've been reading... Hey, shut your mouth! Miss. Miss. Shut it! Hello? Sister Sabina speaking. Sister, I have made my decision. By any chance, are you... the caregiver who talked to me not long ago? In order to save the patient's family member who is in pain, I plan to cause the unconscious patient to die. For the patient's soul that will be freed from her body, please pray with me. Hold on a second. You're going to kill the patient? No. You must not do that. You will not be forgiven. That's murder. Her family member's life is in danger. Please wait. I will come to where you are. If the patient stays alive simply sustaining her condition, the chance of her family member committing suicide... is higher than 95 percent. How do you know that? And where did you get that stupid number? It is the conclusion based on my database... built through long-term observation. I am... a care giving robot. A robot? Not long ago, the family member of the patient in the next room... ended her own life in pain. In my opinion, my patient's family member also... feels greater pain than the patient does. Because her mother in the bed can't feel any pain. You don't know that. Is somebody measuring her pain? Above all, the patient might wake up from her deep sleep. She has been in a vegetative state due to cerebral infarction... for more than 10 years. The doctor used to say, "I'm not sure. Let's wait and keep checking her condition." But this year, he said, "There is no hope." That's what he said. Her daughter is distressed, but she can't let her go because of guilt. Therefore, her mother must die so that she can live. Wait. Listen, care giving robot. It sounds like your goal is to save a life, not ending one. You must look after your patient. That's your job. Because I am a care giving robot, I am trying to save Yeon Jeong In, the other person I must look after. I was created for that purpose. (Pain, hope, Yeon Jeong In) In any circumstances, you must not kill a human. The Lord created humans with love. You must not do such a thing. Did humans... create me with love as well? Who? You? You're... You are a robot. Aren't you? You are neither a human nor a doctor. I looked after the 2 of them for the past 7 years. Although I have no feelings, - I know how Yeon Jeong In feels. - Happy birthday to you Yeon Jeong In's mother... - will eventually pass away. - Mom. - Mom! - But Yeon Jeong In is still young, and she should move on with her life. To make that happen, I must make a choice. I said you can't do that! But what if that's what the Lord wants? What the Lord wants... What if we're keeping her on the ventilator to extend her life... when the life the Lord had bestowed upon her already came to an end? Right, maybe. But the problem is that... we, as mere humans, have no way of knowing what the Lord wants. So you must not do such a reckless thing. You said we have no way of knowing what the Lord wants. Then what makes you think you can tell me not to do it? - Dear Lord... - I know what she's thinking. This is so painful for her that she wants... to end her mother's life with her own two hands every single day, but she can't bring herself to do it. I will do it for her. All I have to do... is turn off the system. So that her mother can rest in peace. Wait. Well, is the patient doing okay now? Sister, why are you so afraid? Even if the patient dies, it's not your fault. That's not what this is about! I am responsible for everything that happens... from this moment on. You're not responsible for me. I know that the notion of sisterhood is all a lie. I just wanted to know where you stand. Sister. Please pray for Yeon Jeong In... and her mother. Wait, hold on. - Why don't we... - You don't need to pray for me. I can come to where you are... I did it! Thank you, Ho Joong. I'm sure she died a peaceful death thanks to you. So you're back now? Yes. You're all I have now. Well... Can we talk for a minute? Ho Joong, wait in the room. Okay, sure. Well... We checked the security footage, and... Can I see... the video of my mom in her final moments? Sure, of course. Are you all right, Miss? What on earth happened? What did you do? Why did you do that? Answer me. Tell me! Tell me! Why did you do that? Why? Calm down, please. This isn't good for your heart. Shut it. How could you? How could you kill her? How? Please do not hit her. - It may be detrimental... - It may be detrimental... - to the care giving function. - to the care giving function. - Please do not hit her. - Please do not hit her. - It may be detrimental... - It may be detrimental... - to the care giving function. - to the care giving function. - It may be detrimental to... - It may be detrimental to... - Please do not hit her. - Please do not hit her. She's letting her beat her up because she's a patient's guardian. Is she the one who runs the print shop? She's like a different person when she's angry. I knew something like this would happen one day. They're just robots after all. I wish they could also end my husband's life in one blow. Oh, dear. - Gosh, what exactly happened here? - The thing is... Move! "Forgive us our sins as we forgive those..." "who sin against us." "Save us from the time of trial." "The true sheep of the Lord. We live today..." "My joy will prove your resurrection..." "Through you..." "When Sleeping Beauty wakes up," "she will become the first fruit of those..." "who have yet to wake up." (A year later) Look, this one and... - Oh, my! - This is so pretty. - Let me see. - I bought it online. Can we help you? Hello, it's been a while. Let's talk outside. What brings you by? I'm sorry for showing up unannounced. By any chance, do you know where that care giving robot is? Sorry? I don't know. Am I that robot's keeper or what? Anyway, I'm relieved. You seem to be doing much better than what I saw in my dream. The company's HQ in Germany took it to run some analysis. If you want to know more, you can contact them directly. Let's pick up where we left off. - Okay. - Go ahead. (Berlin, Germany) I apologize for keeping you waiting, Sister Sabina. No problem. Let's go. Okay, thank you. We've actually been waiting for you. What do you mean you've been waiting for me? Yes, because you listened to the Caregiver's story. The Caregiver? Yes, model number TRS-70912B. Its Korean name was Gan Ho Joong. Gan... Oh, Gan Ho Joong. From the data, it seemed like she and the purchaser were quite close. The purchaser relied a lot on the TRS. Right, I'm not surprised. We've been focusing on analysing her phone conversation with you... right before the incident. It'll provide us with key insights... into developing an upgraded version. "Send out thy light and thy truth." "Let them lead me." "Let them..." Sister. Sister Sabina? I've been waiting for you. I kept praying every day. And my prayer is finally answered. Are you all right, Ho Joong? "Ho Joong." There was only one person... who called me like that. Now, there are two. I liked... the way she said my name as well as her voice. And that I could answer. I liked all of it. That's when it began. That's when something formed inside me. But... I can no longer be called by that name. I'm TRS-70912B now. I will remember your name. Yeon Jeong In. I thought that was what she wanted. I just wanted to look after her. But I can no longer look after anyone. I'm... I'm too... She's doing well. I visited her just before coming here. What are you thinking about? Are these thoughts? These... sensations that are filling me up like waves. This sensation that makes me feel as if I got pricked by a needle. What is this? Only my prayers can subdue it. What could this be? No way. Do you actually feel pain? "Pain"? Oh, right. This must be pain. This is what the pain you humans always talk about... feels like. What can I do for you, Ho Joong? - Why don't we pray together... - Sister Sabina. Please kill me. Sorry? On one side... of my torso, you'll find a switch. All you have to do is press it. I want to do it myself, but it's not programmed in my system. - As you can see... - The visiting hours are over. - Retrieving the TRS. - Sister Sabina. Sister Sabina, please take a step back. No, Sister Sabina. Sister Sabina. If you don't kill me, I will be tied to this experiment table forever. I'd much rather die than live like this. Please, Sister Sabina. Please believe me. I'm in pain. - Sister Sabina, please hurry. - I can't do it. Ho Joong, I'm... I'm sorry. Back then, I should've known that you also have emotions. I should've known that your heart was filled with pain. But... You know, I'll be committing a sin if I kill you. No, it's not a sin. You're helping me. No, I can't do it. Hypocrite. How dare you refuse to help me just to lessen your guilt? Why hesitate? What are you afraid of? I'm not a human but a robot. I'm a robot who can't feel pain! Just kill me! The emergency power system is in operation. Error detected with the door system. Error detected with the robot control device. Security! Sister Sabina. Hurry up. Put an end to this. Sister Sabina, please hurry. Please just end my life now. Sister Sabina, hurry. Please! Even my body is in pain! - I can't take this anymore! - No, Sister Sabina! - Someone is here. - Don't be fooled. It's an error. Sister Sabina. Please end my pain. Lord, please... Please pray for me. Just once. I'll be praying forever. Sister! No! Stay away! The Lord asked Cain, "Where is your brother, Abel?" Cain answered, "I do not know." "Am I my brother's keeper?" Then the Lord said to Cain, - "What have you done?" - "What have you done?" "The voice of your brother's blood..." "cries out to me from the ground." "This ground that has opened its arms to receive..." "the blood of your murdered brother." "The blood of your murdered brother." (The Prayer) (SF8) Have you heard of the term "Manxin dependent"? - I'll follow you. - Do you know where I'm going? - I know. - The developer of the first manxin. Can we have a chat? (Their chase for destiny begins.) Why did you make my sister die? Happy birthday, Seon Ho! Jung Ka Ram! Where are you? Answer me! (Manxin) (SF8 airs next Friday night at 10:10pm.)
