There's a Syrian in Cologne. It took us an hour to drive here and the menu is like the falafel joint round the corner. Well, Syrians are Arabs, too. And why did it have to be a Syrian? Because of the Syrian boy in your class? How do you know him? - Word gets around. Cool castle courtyard. "Umayyad Mosque." Aleppo must've been beautiful before the war. How long has the war been going on? Since 2011, I think. Civil war. Civil war? - Well, they've been massacring each other. It's not that simple. Lots of others are massacring, too. And sending weapons. So who's fighting whom? It's complicated. - Isa, your cell, Look. This is what it looks like now. Let me see. - Let me see. Ready to order? I'd like a beer to start with. - Two.

Do have to sleep over for Ben's surprise? Yeah, definitely. - ... We find all kinds of information. It has been claimed, and information proves it... Do my parents have to sign it? Yes - ... everyone is separated by six degrees. Walt, Emily There's too much talking. Ben, either participate or at least be quiet and listen. I am listening. Everyone's separated by six degrees. And what does that mean? - That I know someone... who knows someone who knows someone... and the sixth person knows... Bibi from BeautyPalace. People even maintain, and there's experimental evidence, that the internet is a sort of global village... Kheder! Yes, Tariq. It's a great idea. Would you like to share with us? Boys, I'm talking to you. Tariq's brother, Kheder. He's on his way to Germany. He might even be here already, but.. Tariq doesn't know where. So if it's really true about the six degrees, we can find him. - That's a great idea! If each of us asks ten people, then... - Why not? We'll make it our media studies project. An intelligent application of study material. We want to help you, Tariq. Do you agree to this? Good. First off, we'll do a wanted poster. WANTED: MY BROTHER NAME: KHEDER SABIL AGE:19 HEIGHT: 1.77, HAIR COLOR: BROWN Hey guys, the wanted poster is ready. You can put it online. It's up. Things will move fast now. For sure. Look what I bought myself. For Nadine and Markus' wedding. Pretty - Right. I think so, too. When is it? - On the 23rd. You need a white shirt for church. Do I have to?

No results? Sadly, no. - We had two leads but they went nowhere. Same here. - My brother posted it He's got a huge fan base. Then we just need a title patience. Tariq, these things take time. We only started last week. Wait. Walt up. Here. You can sleep over on the 23rd. I wanted to show you something. Something very special. Come on, be careful! Come on, be careful! Are you really sure you don't want to come? Stay out of mischief! Tum off the TV at ten. - At twelve. And make sure your brother eats. Dad, he can open the fridge on his own. And he can use a microwave. -I can. And if anything's up... - ... don't call us. Of course you call - But only if you have to. Bye! I'm going out later. We girls are having a sleepover party. You don't mind? Nope. Do you? Say, is your mother home? Or your father? They've gone shopping. It always takes ages. I'll call your mother. She left her cell here. To charge it I can give her a message. No, I have to discuss organizational matters. I'll wait. You two can play. But it really takes ages. She's going to the dry cleaner's and cobbler's. I can really take a message. I have to know when to pick up Tariq tomorrow. We can bring him over. Is after lunch okay? Fine. Tariq, have you got everything? Ah, right! I almost forgot. If anything's up, you have my number. Then have fun, boys. - Thanks. Bye. - Bye. What is that? A huge hole. It chews up everything in its way. Why? Brown coal. In the ground. For power plants. Electricity. What it chew up? Everything. Whole villages. My village. Is this against rules? Not for us. I used to live here. I have to show it to you. NO ENTRY FROM 5 P.M. TO 6 A.M. That was our ice cream parlor. They had the best ice cream in the world. The digger's breaking everything. Like bombs back home. No. Not like your home. Everyone here gets a new home. Even the mice get one. There's no war here. When the coal is gone, it'll be covered over. There will be fields, or a lake. Sad. No home left, right? No. I'm doing fine. It's not like your situation. That's hard. That move is just brilliant. - Should I show it you? Seriously? Would you? I mean, it's your move. - It my brother's move. Kheder show me, I show you. Ball there, then... When the ball come here, tote it up. Float it up. - Flirt it up. Then in the middle, like this, like this, and then you shoot. Ready? And again. You can do, Ben. Go on! No. Dot like... - Shit. Almost. And again. I can't do it. You can do it, come on. I'll never get it. Not without ball. Sometimes we need time, Ben. It has to grow. Inside you. You get it at some point. You need patience. What? It's true. I'll find patience for Kheder's move, and you'll find it for the search for Kheder. Here. Our old house. This was my old room. The bed was here. At least I don't bang my head in the new house. My old house was next to train station. Didn't that bug you? That's why you're always at the station. Or is it because of Kheder? Tasty huh? Really tasty. Some animal. There's a hedgehog here. Shall we sing? Against the hedgehogs. Sing? Demons has risen Fearful the golden vision Times got clear That's a lullaby. How do you know it? - My grandma always sing it. For me and for Kheder. Come, let's sing. Demons has... "The moon." The moon. And a demon is more like... sing? I don't think so. I can't really. No one will hear. Except me. And hedgehog. And I... The moon has risen The golden stars' precision In the heavens, clear and bright... And then it goes.. Someone's there. Just listen. Is in your house? I think so. Oh, God! Oh, God! Did you scare me! - You me! What are you doing here? Isa? Everything OK? It's just my brother and his friend. A, right.

What about our bikes? - Come on, now! Good evening. What are you two doing here? How old are you, anyway? - Please let us go. You know this is trespassing? But this is our old house. That's irrelevant. It's off-limits for all of you, too. It's my fault. We went on an excursion and it suddenly got dark. Sol thought we'd better stay here til morning. For shelter, you know? And then you pitched a tent in the yard, spontaneously? Tell it to the police. Please, we promise never to do it again. It just be paperwork for you, anyway. What do you take me for? - We're not worried about ourselves. My friend here will... - You should've thought about that earlier. Give me your parents' number. I just don't know what you were thinking, Isa. Did you consider the consequences it could have for Tariq? It's not lea's fault. She just wanted to help us. It's my fault. I wanted to show Tariq our old village. Isa wanted to take us home. Oh, yeah? Just you wait. No more Mr. Nice Guy. - Or Mrs. Nice Guy:. Pocket money is suspended. And Wi-Fi is off. - Right. Until Christmas, We're confiscating your cells. And you're grounded. - Precisely No visitors. And you're paying for this cab. - Right. In installments. - With interest! Could you please give us a bill? But let's not tell the people at Tariq's home. It'll only get him in trouble. Well just wash him. Absolutely Are you asleep? I can't. At first was So nice, then was so terrible. But it was worth it right? Yeah, totally Jeez, those children! At least we got some wedding cake. I guess they didn't find the move so easy after all. Come on, Nane. Mrs. Halder? Is Ben in? And Tariq? They're in the living room. Tariq, why aren't you answering your cell? - We've got him. At least, we found him. Who? Kheder! Tariq, we found your brother. I woke up for a pee and checked the mail I got word from my brother. - Our neighbor. She must've seen it. She knew your address. - And sent us here. To Ben's. - He's in Holland. In Utrecht. Thanks. You're not happy. I am. I'm just a bit tired. It was your idea. And it worked. That's good news, hm? We've still got time. Sit down. Please be glad. For me. I'd like to. But we've just become friends and now you're leaving. We can write, send pictures and visit. Out of sight, out of mind, Tariq! It's a saying. If you don't see each other... you forget each other. And that's how it is. Maybe not. I not seen my brother in a long time. I not forget. With... With brothers it's different. But I've had it with friends. I moved away and all my friends... I'm sorry. You stay in contact but they forget anyway? What can I do? I'm a child. I don't have any time. If you think I forget my friend, OK, you're my brother. And you stay brothers forever. What? Like in stories. All the best, dude. Oh, here comes the father's salad. Looks tasty. - It is, too. Then we've got a hedgehog... Do you play soccer, too? - Yes. Cool. Hello, I happen to be the father of the young lady on your lap: Sven. I'm Felix. If you want some salad... - Sven! Hey, having fun?
