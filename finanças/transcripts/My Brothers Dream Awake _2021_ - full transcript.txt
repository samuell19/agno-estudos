That's why they brought it here. ﻿Stop, motherfuckers! ﻿They're raiding House 7! ﻿Stop, you fucking guards! ﻿Smells awful... ﻿Flea stop farting, man. Everything smells like tear gas. ﻿What's up, Jaime? ﻿Did they move you from House 7 to 5? ﻿No, it's temporary. ﻿Why? What happened last night? ﻿They stole a cellphone... ﻿What the fuck are you saying? ﻿Walls have ears. Yesterday you stole one and that started a fight. ﻿That's what guards make up so they can raid our houses. ﻿Why don't you stop scaring everybody? ﻿Who's scaring who, motherfucker. ﻿Shut the fuck up, you motherfucker. ﻿Speak alone, man... ﻿Hey, it's true. When these assholes are bored... they take the new ones and put them to fight. ﻿They even bet. I made them earn a lot of money... ﻿Pose as you please, guys. ﻿That face...

You screwed up. ﻿You were close, man. You were left with nothing. ﻿Fuck me... ﻿Again? ﻿Yeah, man... I'm sick of this shit. ﻿Will it ever stop? ﻿No idea... ﻿What's with the face, Angelito... ﻿He had a bad dream. ﻿Perhaps your chakras are a bit misaligned. ﻿You know what? ﻿I believe... ﻿That happens when someone has unfinished business. ﻿Or some hidden sin... ﻿Don't you think? ﻿Angel's mysteries... ﻿Ok guys, if you need anything, I'll be in my trailer. ﻿Get up, bro. ﻿Today we could have good news. ﻿What if they let us go? ﻿Well, guys, same old story. ﻿We don't have a court date yet. ﻿Not yet? ﻿That's just how it is... ﻿We've been waiting for a year.

Eight more months? ﻿Guys, as long as there's no trial, nor conviction, ﻿there's not much I can do. ﻿How many times have you been here? One. One? ﻿Yes, one. ﻿Well, I have to... It's about... ﻿Your mother. ﻿She... ﻿stopped asking for your custody. ﻿Stop thinking about it... ﻿Did you really think she was going to take us back? ﻿At least you would've greeted her when she came, man... ﻿So now is my fault she doesn't visit you. ﻿I didn't say that shit. ﻿Don't believe her, man... ﻿Once, she promised me she would take me to an amusement park. ﻿And here I am. ﻿Still waiting. ﻿Look. I promise you something. ﻿When we leave here... ﻿I will take you to the amusement park. ﻿We're going to get on that game, that goes up and up... ﻿And out of nowhere... Boom! ﻿You go down. ﻿Your soul leaves your body. ﻿You know what? ﻿I would like to meet my other brother... ﻿And mom's house. ﻿Where are you going? ﻿Franco, please. Can you open? ﻿Hey. ﻿Hey, bro. ﻿Please. Open the door. ﻿Your hand... ﻿Are you ok? A little dizzy? ﻿A bit... ﻿Honestly, I want to hit you, man... ﻿Do you know what would happen if they see you like this? ﻿You know what would happen? ﻿They'd separate us, man. Is that what you want? ﻿Do you want to be alone? ﻿Do you want to be left alone? Answer me... ﻿I'm sorry... ﻿No one can see this. ﻿Did you hear me? ﻿Now hug it out, motherfucker. ﻿Close your eyes. ﻿Come on. ﻿Here you cannot turn your back or close your eyes. ﻿Close them. ﻿I want you to think about yourselves. ﻿But, really. ﻿What do you see? ﻿Just shit. ﻿When people... look here, they see walls. ﻿Bars... ﻿I see boys who live together. ﻿Imagine you are... on a mountain. ﻿On the top of the mountain where they sent you, ﻿because you made a mistake. ﻿But, who doesn't? ﻿And you are relaxed... ﻿I see future. ﻿A free future. ﻿That's it. ﻿What did you smoke, ma'am? ﻿- Ok now? - Yes. ﻿What's up, sister! ♫ ﻿"Listen, my people."♫ ﻿Bro, she brought me cake.

What's your name? Did the cat eat his tongue? ﻿What are you looking? ﻿Relax, bro. After one of these, you're ready. Yes or no? ﻿- Cheers. - ﻿Thanks, man. ﻿What happened to your eye? ﻿Citizen's arrest. ﻿You were lucky. ﻿Unlike Alan. ﻿Which Alan? A friend. With whom we played in the village. ﻿He went to live to a settlement ﻿with a couple who had two little girls. ﻿One of the girls loved to always climb the same tree... ﻿You know those cherries that leave spots that look like blood? ﻿One day, ﻿a neighbour found one of the girls in the tree, crying. ﻿He approached her to see what was happening... ﻿and noticed that her legs and dress had red stains. ﻿He thought the worst. ﻿It must have been Alan. ﻿He told all the neighbors. ﻿And they beat the shit out of him, man. ﻿They tortured him. With knifes, punches, kicks... ﻿And then they left him there. ﻿He bled all night... ﻿The next day they realized: the girl hadn't been attacked. ﻿The stains weren't blood. ﻿But it didn't matter. ﻿In the end, whatever went wrong... ﻿it was always Alans who they will blame first. What's up with that? He shot himself in the head, in the guardhouse. ﻿Look, that one... ﻿He's the "whoreface". House 3. ﻿You don't even want to look at him, bro... ﻿He asks all the new ones for some favors. ﻿You know what... ﻿He has escaped three prisons. ﻿That's why he's famous. ﻿And you believe him. ﻿Because it's true. ﻿And if he's so cool, why is he here? ﻿Visiting someone... ﻿You always believe what the dumbest ones say. ﻿And you're one of them. ﻿That's why I'm here. ﻿You're mean with the Flea... ﻿Let's go? I'll take a look around this center... ﻿You two haven't separated. ﻿We are soulmates, ma'am. ﻿And you found your soulmate? ﻿Once... ﻿What happened? ﻿Nothing. I rather be here, with you. ﻿Really. ﻿Ma'am, she wants to ask you a question. ﻿Can a man break his penis? ﻿Nice questions, girl... ﻿Shut up, motherfucker. You are there gossiping. Ok, ok. ﻿That's it. ﻿Finish your paintings. ﻿Ma'am, and... ﻿If a person has problems. I mean... ﻿He cannot erect his penis. ﻿Could it be because of something that happened to him? ﻿It might be. Well. ﻿In the other prison, girls were taken out every night... ﻿By a bunch of disgusting old rich married men. ﻿Just like in the video games store... ﻿In front of the court. ﻿A guy arrived, grabbed several boys, and took them to the old fucks... ﻿Once, I woke up in the Hilton. ﻿Dead-ass serious, man. ﻿I went down for breakfast and shit... ﻿But they kicked me out. Well. ﻿The rich and the priests are disgusting... ﻿That's why they are such good friends. ﻿You could run for President, Flea. Well. I'm not that stupid. Hey… ﻿How did the fuckers discover you? ﻿There was a man in the lobby, ﻿he said to me: ﻿"And you? Which room are you from?" ﻿I said: "I don't know... The presidential suite" ﻿I swear I said that. And he tells me: "No, there isn't one of those here, go away." ﻿Things have been complicated? ﻿A bit. ﻿Did you have breakfast? ﻿Write your name. ﻿- Hi, girls. - Hi, ma'am. ﻿Come in. ﻿Don't open the mock test until I said so. ﻿Ok. ﻿Start. ﻿Don't be scared. I will not copy you. ﻿Time's up. Deliver the mock test. ﻿Thanks. Okey. ﻿Thanks, Carol. ﻿Thank you, ma'am. ﻿What took you so long? Okay. ﻿What? ﻿Too ridiculous? ﻿It's your thing. ﻿The teacher checked my spelling... ﻿Nice, cool. ﻿And if she doesn't come, they can pass it to her later. ﻿And here we go... ﻿They told us she is coming, man. ﻿Are you going to greet her at least? ﻿Yeah, man. Relax. ﻿Look. ﻿- Let me see. - I also have one. ﻿Let me see yours. Hey... ﻿Did you invite her? ﻿Maybe... she forgot it was today. ﻿Or maybe... ﻿she arrives later. ﻿She... didn't answer my calls all week. You called her a lot.... ﻿- You made her mad. - So now is grandma's fault? ﻿Shut up... ﻿Don't be disrespectful, man. ﻿Damn it... ﻿Dude, let's go. There's still half an hour left. ﻿Hey, man, shake it up. It's not their fault. ﻿I don't want to, man... I can't take it anymore.... ﻿Forget about it... ﻿We've been always be the two of us. I can't take it here anymore, dude.... ﻿The guys... ﻿are planning a mutiny. ﻿And... ﻿Some of us could escape. We can run to the mountains. ﻿Why do you want to go out like this? What do you plan to do outside? ﻿Anything but being here, locked up, man. ﻿Would you go to our grandparents? ﻿The first place the police would head to. ﻿Or to mom's? ﻿Fucking old bag, she'd probably send us back here. ﻿Do you plan to eat air? ﻿- That's not how things work, Franco. - And how do they work? ﻿Like you want to? Fuck you, man. ﻿What the fuck, you fucking asshole? - Leave me alone, man... - ﻿What's going on there? ﻿Nothing, man... Motherfucker, fool. Mom. I know it's hard, but... it would be cool to be able to live with you. We could share the room with your other son... I would like to meet him. And who does he look more like? Me or the Angel? Wish that to me, because Angel is so ugly. ﻿I'm counting the days to see you. ﻿I love you so much. Come on, get out of the bathroom, asshole. Little brother… ﻿Bro, he's been like that for five minutes. ﻿I don't know what's wrong with him, man. ﻿Flea, get out please! ﻿It's Flea, bro. ﻿Franco, man! ﻿Open the door, man. ﻿Stop hitting your fucking head! ﻿Franco, open the door! ﻿What's going on? ﻿Open the door or it will be worse! ﻿Franco, listen to me! Open the door! ﻿Open the door, Franco! ﻿Open the door, last call. ﻿Walk outside! ﻿Don't hit him! ﻿Why do you treat him like this? Can't you see how he is! ﻿Get off me, man! ﻿I'm going to kill you! ﻿Relax or they will take you too. ﻿You don't care! ﻿Because is not your brother! Get off me, motherfucker! ﻿When that happened to me, they drugged me for 3 days. ﻿I was a mess... because my visits didn't arrive. ﻿A week later I woke up in the hospital. ﻿Flea... ﻿When he suffers the most is on New Year's Eve. ﻿That fucking illusion that you can start from scratch. ﻿But the truth is nothing changes. ﻿But at least he has you, man. ﻿And you could get him out of here... ﻿You know how. ﻿In all the other prisons, I've been, the same shit happens. ﻿But one time... we armed ourselves. ﻿We planned it for 3 weeks and... ﻿until we did it. ﻿20 of us tried. ﻿15 of us succeed. ﻿Tell me. Where are you going? ﻿It's not your business. ﻿Fuck you, man... ﻿It's better for you not to know anything. ﻿What's up, guys. ﻿How's my Angelito? You look amazing, man. ﻿And this one? Your little brother? ﻿Yep, this is little Flea. ﻿Little "Flea", man? He's taller than you. ﻿And he will join us? ﻿- No, he's going home. - How does he go home? ﻿You want to keep all the money? Don't be selfish, man. ﻿Yeah. ﻿Bro, would you like to have $200 in your hands? ﻿You could buy candy, have cavities, and fix your teeth with the same money. ﻿He's too young. ﻿Here's what we're gonna do. ﻿I have some things in my car. Let's relax... ﻿And then we're going to be strategic. ﻿Okay? ﻿- Come on. - Let's go. ﻿Let's go, man. Let's go. ﻿They haven't let me see him for two days. ﻿I know... Me neither. ﻿There’s not much we can do. And what the hell are you for? ﻿Angel... What he did is serious... ﻿Well, they are... ﻿preparing the transfer. ﻿I think it won't be from House 5... ﻿It will be from prison. ﻿Hey, are you ok? ﻿Me and my sister were also put in different prisons. Really? ﻿Yes, when she turned fourteen. ﻿And since when do you not see her? ﻿Since there... ﻿Hey, man. ﻿- What's up? - Can you give me a pill? ﻿Now it's not your turn, Michael. If you know. Sit down ﻿I feel like shit, man. Please inject me, a pill... You know I'll be fast. I know, but sit down and be calm... ﻿You don't know, man! I really feel like shit... I have already told you. ﻿Sit down. ﻿Hey, bro... ﻿Are you ok? Pay attention to access One ﻿Have they told you anything yet, or not? They haven't told me anything.... ﻿Relax. Flea is a badass. ﻿He'll be fine And if not, we burn everything. ﻿Fuck, man! ﻿Michael! ﻿Michel, dude. ﻿- You got it? - Yes, put it down. Take off the sheet, man. Down it! Michael! Michel, man, react! ﻿Michael, wake up! - Do you have him? - Yeah, man. ﻿Help! ﻿Somebody fucking help him! ﻿Wake up, Michael, please! ﻿UNIVERSITY ADMISSION TEST ﻿Ok, start. ﻿How did you feel? ﻿Haven't you seen Michael? ﻿I don't think you'll see him here again. ﻿We must see how he recovers... ﻿- It doesn't matter to you. - What? ﻿You don't care that we die here. ﻿In the end, it's just one more, one less. ﻿It's not that, Angel... It's just… ﻿Sometimes we just don't know how to keep you alive. ﻿"Keep us alive?" ﻿To be alive we should be out of this shit. ﻿I'm on drugs every day. ﻿I don't know if it's Tuesday or Wednesday. ﻿Maybe my friend is dead, and you, what bullshit are you telling me? ﻿That you don't know? Are you stupid? ﻿Eight boys have died in my watch! ﻿Eight. ﻿And I remember their faces every day. ﻿And you think I don't care? What do you think I'm doing here! ﻿So we are fucked. ﻿Not you. Not you! ﻿The results of the test will come out in one month. ﻿You will apply to university. ﻿And I will help you. ﻿I'm not gonna apply to shit. ﻿For what? Maybe I die tomorrow. ﻿To get out of here. Isn't that what you want? ﻿If you're here in a month, you will apply. ﻿I walk. Yes, I know how to go alone. ﻿Come. Hi, man. ﻿How have you been? ﻿Fine and you? ﻿Better. ﻿- Where were you? - Searching for you... ﻿I heard Michael was transferred. ﻿What will be on the other side? ﻿More mountains? ﻿I don't know. ﻿I was angry there in the nursing. ﻿Why? ﻿Everyone assholes laughed at me because I went crazy for mom. ﻿Motherfuckers. ﻿At least we have some nice memories with her... ﻿Why does nobody question the fucker who abandoned us? ﻿- Hey, Flea. - What. ﻿They won't separate us. ﻿Michael, best known as "Michel". ﻿I hope you get better soon, or you're quietly resting. ﻿They still haven't tell us if you're dead or alive, but, fuck it... ﻿Both are the same shit. ﻿You named me "Poet", because sometimes I talk weird. ﻿But my rhymes are not the same if you are not by my side. ﻿We miss you, bro. ﻿"House 5" sends you a hug. ﻿Dear sister, ﻿I decided that I will be a teacher. ﻿A math teacher, maybe. ﻿When I leave here, I'll invite you for an ice cream. ﻿I love you. ﻿Mr. Warden, We, the boys in House 5, ﻿are doing our best to become better people. ﻿And something that'd help us a lot, would be a PlayStation. ﻿I love you. Mom, ﻿Angel and I miss you... ﻿but I miss you more than him. ﻿I was sad when you didn't arrive... ﻿But then I gave it a thought and I think I deserve it. ﻿I fucked up, mommy. ﻿But I swear I've changed. ﻿I'm even taller. ﻿Please come see us. ﻿I can tell you a joke. ﻿Bye, mom. ﻿Alright. ﻿Put your letters here. ﻿Ma'am, can we eat? ﻿Of course. ﻿In 100 years, do you think someone will remember us? ﻿Us who. ﻿Us, man. ﻿You. ﻿Me... ﻿Flea... ﻿We could have a story. ﻿Hear this one. ﻿Two young people... ﻿That lived here... One day they cheated everyone... ﻿And escaped. ﻿But they left two strips... ﻿Since then, those who want to escape, come here and leave theirs. Sh, sh... ﻿Quiet... Hey. ﻿- What the fuck? - Cut your shit, man. ﻿I'm talking to you, motherfucker. ﻿Stop it, fucker. ﻿- Fucking asshole... - Who invited you? ﻿Go out. ﻿You heard, son of a bitch! Go out! What's up? ﻿You want to lubricate your ass, motherfucker? ﻿Are you ok? Hands on the neck! ﻿Hands up! Get in line and fucking move! Hey you! Come out, come out, with your hands behind your neck. Move you piece of shit! That's it, move! Hurry up, hurry up! Move, man, there! Hurry, hurry! ﻿Come on! ﻿Let's make things clear. ﻿Who's this? ﻿Speak. ﻿No one's? ﻿Everybody stands up. ﻿Stand up, I said! Hands on the back of the neck! ﻿One. ﻿Two. ﻿Three. ﻿Keep going. ﻿You will keep doing them until you remember who’s this is! ﻿And if you don't remember it, you'll be here all afternoon. ﻿How long you've been here? ﻿Four months... ﻿But this is my third time. ﻿A year with my brother. ﻿And you? ﻿Five years, total. ﻿So... ﻿You really think we can escape? ﻿But not all of us. ﻿Just a few. ﻿Sunday is the best day... ﻿After soccer's "Super classic"... ﻿There are less guards. ﻿We burn some things... ﻿They open the accesses for the firefighters... ﻿And we run to the mountain. ﻿In the dark the bullets will not reach us. ﻿- So? - The supervisors are watching movies. They are watching the Titanic. ﻿Really? I love that movie. ﻿Rose sucks. There was room for him in the raft. ﻿- You saw it? - Like 14 times. ﻿My mom is a true fan. ﻿I love when they fuck in the car. Do you remember? ﻿That one, with the hand... ﻿My mom told me that I looked like him. What'd you think? ﻿What. It's true. ﻿It must be because of your blond hair. ﻿Maybe... Let's see. ﻿Draw me. ﻿Hey. ﻿- And she comes to see you or not? - Who? ﻿- Your mom, dude. - She's in jail. ﻿But I will visit her. ﻿Cool. ﻿What's up, motherfucker? ﻿Take off your shirt, so I can believe you. ﻿Streetstyle. ﻿Ok, let's go. ﻿Hurry up.
