I just told you. His yachts in the Virgin Islands. A car will pick you up and bring it to the plane in an hour. Okay? Sam. Sam. I haven't heard from you in weeks, and I'm just supposed to- This, this feels really fast. Like out of nowhere. You are going to have to trust me on this, all right? It's like a second chance for us. This is it. Are you in? You have reached the voicemail box of... Keaton. At the beep. Here you are, ma'am. Thanks. Jen! Oh, my God. Look, who made it, finally. Hello hello. Oh my god, hey girl.

Hi -Jen. - David Calperson, welcome. - Nice to meet you. Thank you. - Sam's told me a lot about you. - Really? It's funny. - I've heard almost nothing about you. - Ha! Well, that's okay, because I was bluffing. Honestly, Sam only talks about herself. Yeah, that sounds about right You guys! - John. shoes off. - Oh. Lose the shoes. John. Hey John watch the teak man! C'mon! What have I told you? Tell the guys. Jen, hurry up. Coming salon. I think this room is pretty self-explanatory. Crazy, right? Hey, come on. I wanna show you the bridge. It's very cool. Watch your step. So here we have a state of the art navigation system. World class. Not to mention our crew is as well. - How you doing boys? - Welcome. Thank you. Say hello to the boys. Hey -Over here. We got radar. As you can see, security cameras to protect us from pirates. Safety first. And, I don't know, buttons and lights and stuff. Hey, gentlemen, when you're ready, go ahead and take us out. Yes, sir, Captain. - Did they just call you Captain? - Huh... Weird. If you follow me down here I'll show you the bedrooms. There's three of them. So you can take your pick. You can bunk up together. I don't care. International waters. No judgment. This is my bedroom. If you need anything, it's bigger. It's nicer. I'm staying here because this is a yacht after all. We'll meet up for dinner. I have to make a phone call to Beijing. But please make yourselves at home. The crew, the contents of the ship. Everything is completely at your disposal. Okay. I'll see you soon. Don't go in there. Just kidding. Go wherever you want. So what's new back at home? Give me something juicy. Keaton came over there other night. Fuck him. I've been having these dreams about him. You mean nightmares? More like memories. You ever have a dream that felt totally real? Yeah, sure. When I'm drunk or after I've eaten too much cheese. Like a ton of cheese. I call them cheese dreams right. Well, I had one of those dreams about Keaton. In the dream I killed him. Ugh, scary. Yeah. I'm sorry I didn't call more do you have any idea how many hospitals I called trying to find you, I thought. I know, I know. I'm sorry. I really am. You know, you probably won't believe me, but I tell everyone about you. We wouldn't be here if it weren't for you. God, you are so much smarter than all of David's friends. All right. You should still feel guilty about it. But I'm gonna work on it. Where's David? I don't know I think I miss him. - Oh my God. - What? Are you listening to yourself? I'm going to go find him. If rhat's okay with you. Let me check my schedule. Yep. Works for me. All right. All right. Ta ta! Sorry. And done. Yeah. Okay. So how did you two meet? Sam picked me up at a bar. - Yeah, you believe that, right? - It's true. She found out that I was an entrepreneur. And she just kind of glommed onto me. Sam's built quite the reputation for you, too, in New York. He's lying. I'm not. Anybody else want an Ambien? No. The last time that I took an Ambien, I woke up, and every single lamp that I own was on top of my refrigerator. And had a roast in the oven, which was seasoned to perfection. It was a fucking good roast. And I've never made roast before or after. So that's something. Can we talk business? Yes, of course. What are you going to talk about? I mean, start. I'd like to know where we're going. I just assumed Sam would've told you that already. You haven't? What kind of business partner are you? We're on our way to my factory in Puerto Rico, and my lawyers are waiting for us there with your contract. Really? Nothing. I'm terrible. I'm a manufacturer. I have a company that produces small metal attachments. We make a lot of buttons mostly. But I've done zippers in the past as well. We do military uniforms, some hospital accouterments, and a lot of professional attire. So my plan to take the equipment that I already have, make a few small tweaks, just in a few new molds. I want to start pumping out your patent. This is where it gets really interesting. I've already got the deal in place. It's a licensing contract. It's gonna make the three of us about $25 million How does that sound? We are about to be on every piece of clothing in the world. I want to officially welcome you to the 1%. You're an entrepreneur. Now. Okay. Your ideas are the ideas that shape the world. Our thoughts become reality. Jen, I need you to trust me when I tell you I know how to make money. And he's got friends who make missiles. Tanks. Actually, that's one friend I have one friend that makes things. It's not that weird. Somebody has to make tanks. So why is the boat, ship, named Vivie Rae? Oh, God. She who shall not be named. His ex-wife. Vivian. Actually, was her name. I guess she thought Vivie Rae sounded more exotic, whatever. Anyway, long story short, my ex-wife had a lot of mental and emotional issues, to say the least, Look, I want to thank you all for being here, for making me a lot of money and for lifting my spirits. Cheers. Hey -Hi. How far away are you from Puerto Rico? About three and a half days. Do you even speak Spanish? I speak the international language of cold, hard cash. Mamacita. Actually, I'm going to go to bed. I'm really tired. But you guys stay up, okay? Jen, wait wait wait wait wait, wait on me. I'm going to go join her. Okay? Yeah. Goodnight. Wait up what's the situation with you two? Me and David? No. The other billionaire on the ship. - Yeah. - Shit. Were you trying to give me some room up there? Do you like him? You're successful. Hasn't tried anything creepy yet. Do you? You just kissed him. Plus, I definitely don't want to have a threesome with you and him. Oh, my God. Jen chill, we were just having some fun. This is a business trip. Honestly, you should have seen him before I met him. He was such a wreck. From the divorce? Yeah, She must of done a real number on him. He doesn't like to talk about her. I think he really loved her. I need to know you for the right reasons. One second. Hey -Hey. Are you comfortable? Yeah. Good. I just wanted to know if you get cold at night, It can get kind of chilly on the ship. Um, I'm fine. Good. Good. I'll see you in the morning. Goodnight -Goodnight. Jen, Jen? Jen. Jesus -Sorry. My interrupting? No. Sit. - Are you sleeping okay? - Yeah. I'm just a morning person. Mind if I ask you a question? What happened in New York between you and Sam? What did Sam tell you? Nothing. It's just that if we're going to work together, which we are. I want to feel like we can trust each other too. If you don't want to talk about it. That's fine. I just want you to feel that you can trust me. But no pressure. So, for the last year, I've been having these panic attacks. I don't know. I think my brain works differently than other people. Cause you're an artist? Because you're a thinker? I don't know about that. No it just got worse, in New York. Sam was gone a lot, hanging out with her new friends. And her new friends were more successful -Ah like me. Yeah. I don't know, I mean, this. This is great. It's it's just not, really me. I disagree. That goes all the way down. I don't want to think about it. Well, just don't think about Jaws. What's Jaws? Really? Huh. Do sharks actually attack you here? Sharks don't come into the bay this late into the winter. But the idea is that when you jump in, make as little a splash as possible. Because they're attracted to the motion! You Jerk. I can't help but feel like something, could just pop out at any moment. What the fuck! David? what about the sharks? I think there's room enough I this big blue sea for all God's creatures. Come jump in. It's perfect. Fuck it. Wait, seriously? C'mon! I told you. - It's so salty. - I know it's nice. Jen! Jen. Jen! You okay? Quick, quick, just get out of the water. You okay? Are you okay? Something's down there. Somethings down there. Hey! Hey. Hey. What was it? You see a fish? Is it Jaws? What? Is this not the best Indian food? Yeah. I don't think we really like this wine. I'm going to get a different bottle. Excuse me. Sam? Sam? I have to go down to the stockroom. I'll be right back. Hey D? Will you grab me a bottle of white, please? Sam, I'm sorry about today. It's like New York all over again. What? That's not fair. White. Thank you. - Sam, Stop, hey. - Hey. No, this is a bad idea. This is a bad idea. What about Jen? Fuck. What do you want? What do you want? What do you want? What do you want? What do you want? Why are you here? Why are you here? Jen? Wake up Jen. Wait -Jen wake up! Drop the knife Jen! - What is that? - Drop it! Jen wake up! Wake up Jen! Drop it! Wake up Jen! Wake up! - Drop the knife. Drop the knife Jen. - Hey! Hey! Get off of her! Hey, hey, hey. Is she sleep walking? She probably had a nightmare. Are you okay? Yeah yeah yeah. Try to get some rest. Yeah, You need it. Sam wait. Wait. Can I talk to you? You know those dreams I told you about. You think they're real? What are you talking about? I think they happened. I think if you had killed Keaton, we both would know, don't you? You don't believe me. Look, I know that the past couple of months have been crazy, but. I don't think it's safe to say that you've lost your mind, Jen. I'm seeing things. It's a figure. It's like. It's like this presence. Jen, stop. - It's like a black hole. - Stop it! I'm trying. - You need to keep it together. - I'm trying. Please, for me. Okay? We've come this far already. Don't fuck this up. Understood? Sam. - Goodnight. Sleep good alright? - Sam, wait? Goodnight. We'll talk in the morning. David, I am. So sorry. The subconscious is a powerful thing. She's home. She's missing you. She's scared. She's alone. Now she's here. Her life is changing a lot that can affect people. I know it's strange, but human beings are strange creatures. I think the best thing we could do right now is get some sleep separately. Did we ruin everything? No. One bad dream can't ruin everything. Did I make things, weird between us though? Come here. nothing's weird. Get some sleep. Goodnight -Goodnight... Girl, you've been so good to me Stayin' by my side through the bad times. All my dreams never came true somehow But things are gonna be different now, baby. My ship is comin' in, baby, baby. My ship is comin' in. And won't it be fine? Girl, we're gonna make it this time you can throw away that shabby dress, buy yourself. The finest things in town, girl. Dry your eyes We're celebrating. Oh, there's so many good times waiting baby. My ship is comin' in, baby, baby. Let me the fuck out of here! Hello? Somebody let me out. Let me let me the fuck out of here! Help! What the fuck? Morning. My door was locked. Huh? That's weird. We're gonna have some breakfast. Come join me. Found her. Morning. Morning. Yep. Jen! How are you feeling? Much better. - Good. - Yeah. I think I just needed some sleep. Sam told me that you were having some sort of bad dream the night before you came here. Yeah. Yeah, it was pretty crazy. What was that about? My ex. Keaton. He just showed up at my house. I just had a dream that something happened. Something like what? I don't I don't remember, actually. I'm really sorry that that happened to you. All I can tell you is that you're not going to have to worry about people like that anymore. You're gonna have so much money. You can pay somebody to take care of him if you need to. Yeah, I don't know. I think I was stressed and. I was worried about Sam. I missed her. felt pretty alone. I know it's strange, but human beings are strange creatures. All right, I'm going to go shower. Still have all this saltwater in my hair from yesterday. Excuse me, sir? - What? - Could I have a word with you for a moment? Okay. Just take a second. Excuse me. Some of the crew have been talking. We're a little bit concerned about the situation from last night. - Yeah. - I think it would be a good idea to start the discussion about finding a place to dock. No, that's not going to work. We need to stay on schedule, so just do your fucking job. Ladies? Girls? Hey Jen? - Sam?! - Dave! What the fuck? Sorry I thought she was coming for you. What? Jen? Are you crazy? What's happening? I have no idea. - Buddy, stay with me. - No, Joe! I need, I need a first aid kit right now. Any crew member, I need a first aid kit. Joe, Joe, Stay with me, buddy. Stay with me. C'mon Joe. - You alright, you alright. - Keep talking buddy, keep talking keep on talking buddy, Keep on talking. You're going to be all right. Kiss me -No Keaton, Keaton no! Get off!

David, there is a dead body on this ship we have to stop! David! What are you doing? Jen told me that you gave her something in New York. Where did you get it? What are you talking about? I'm talking about her necklace. From some vintage shop in Green point. You're lying to me. Why would you say that? You said you have Ambien. Give it to me. - Why? - Get me the fucking pills! When did they get to you? Hm? Who gave you the necklace? Who told you to give it to Jennifer? Was it before we met? Was it a coincidence we met in that bar? - Was it a coincidence we met that bar?! - You are insane! This is every last dime I have that isn't in assets. You can consider it a signing bonus. I don't know who you're working with, but I know for a fact you won't get more money than working with. But David, what, Hi. I'm so sorry about all of this. What the fuck is going on? I know none of this is your fault. Lemme help you. But here's the deal. Sam! I need you to relax until you get this contract signed. So I have a few pills here that are going to help you.
