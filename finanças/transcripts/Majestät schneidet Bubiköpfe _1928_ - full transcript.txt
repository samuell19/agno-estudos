Alberti Midsummer’s eve in the small Swedish coastal town Salthamn. One who rejoiced in youth and sunshine was old Grégory, the exotic barber on High Street. "It's now twenty years since I came to Sweden - twenty midsummer eves I've seen the maypole go by!" "Most interesting - but I am in a hurry -" That day Nickolo Grégory came home with newly acquired bachelor’s degree. DANGER EXPLOSIVES! "Grandfather!" "Do you think I have kept you studying in Uppsala just to let you become a barber!" "And do you think that I want to bum around, without helping you, who are old and tired?" "But Nickolo, think of the great future that awaits you..." "Please grandfather, let me do this!" Shingle performed by newly arrived expert. LONG HAIR - A WOMAN’S MOST BEAUTIFUL ASSET! I, Sophie Svensson, was by the age of twenty COMPLETELY BALD. I have obtained my 160 centimeter long, naturally curled, GIANT-LORELEI-HAIR by daily use of the - by myself invented - patented SOPHIE SVENSSON’S HAIR TONIC At Satlö castle - ascended from the waves by Sophie Svensson’s hair tonic - the extremely wealthy inventress lived. "Cheers, Madam!" "You fool - it’s for the hair..." "Good morning, Count Edelstjerna!" "Your wonderful hair tonic has made me ten years younger!" "May I ask how your charming granddaughter is doing?" "Tonight at the dance - you can reveal the secret of your heart for my little Astrid -" In the boudoir old Grégory, who had been the barber and the friend of the house for twenty years, was waiting. "Hello there, Astrid!" "Isn’t he adorable, the new barber?" "What a marvelous girl! You must introduce me to her!" "Don’t fool yourself! Astrid Svensson should at least have a count -!" End of first act. Second act. "Astrid, the Count will propose tonight, and six weeks from now -" "- you will be a Countess!" "I will only marry a man who I can love -" "- or -" "- or else -" "- or else you will have to get me a King!" "I might be wealthy enough to buy her anything, but a King -" "Nay-no, a King can’t be bought for money!" "Thanks, but I don’t dance!" "Miss Astrid - my heart and - my wealth..." "I’m sorry, I couldn’t hear you!" "Let’s play a waltz, boys!" "My dear André - your grandson and my Astrid - that’s really not suitable!" "You are right - that would be a misalliance!" "Wouldn’t it be nice to go for a row?" "The flag of Tirania - my home country!" "Aren’t you Swedish?" "How interesting - tell me more!" "Grandfather brought me here when I was little - I have never known my father or mother -" "Such a fool! For twenty years he has let us scam him." "And this time it will cost him even more - right?" "This was cleverly arranged by you!" "But you can’t ask for anything else by a simple barber..." "Do you know how to row?" "Then we don’t need a simple barber in the boat -" "Mr Nickolo, I was unfair to you -" "Is there anything else her Ladyship wishes?" "If you don’t catch a cold by this, you may come tomorrow morning and do my hair!" End of second act. Third act. "Yesterday bobbed, today shingled - and still not satisfied!" "And how is prince Nickolo - our dear successor to the throne - doing?" "Dear chamberlain, dear lieutenant-general..." "- His royal highness is preparing for his great vocation!" "The whole of Tirania awaits the return of the old dynasty -" "We have come to bring back prince Nickolo to the throne of his forefathers!" "But to bring about a coup d'état three things are needed -" "I know! money, money and once again money!" "And you think that paltry sum would be enough for a coup d’état?" "Either you get us ten times as much by today - or your ward will never become king -" "I know who will give us the money!" "Grandmother will be furious - but anyway - shingle me!" "From now on our friendship is over!" "For this you can thank your grandson, that villain -" "Be careful not to commit high treason!" "Yesterday you said you couldn’t buy a king’s crown for miss Astrid -" "- but today you can!" "The thousand year old iron crown of Tirania!" "Nickolo is not my grandson -" "He is -" "Don’t tell me he is a prince!" "And I have just thrown him out!" "HRH still isn’t yet aware of his royal ancestry." "Twenty years ago I was court barber to the late king Nickolo of Tirania." "HRH will certainly become just as great heart breaker as Your Majesty!" "But in the shade of the throne treason and rebellion lurked -" "During that terrible night -" "The dynasty is overthrown! Save the only survivor - our little crown prince!" "Flee with Nickolo to a country far away while waiting for the hour of return!" "The hour of return has come -" "Yes, yes, yes - but if he is going to become my son-in law I need some written evidences..." "But to bring about a coup d'état three things are needed..." "Let me guess one of them: money..." "How much has your minister of finance requested?" "What I am about to do? Tell the newspaper about the engagement!" "We are surrounded by spies! Tonight we will sail for Tirania incognito." End of third act. Fourth act. "I have just arranged the engagement between His Royal Highness and the richest heiress in Sweden." There are women who would sacrifice anything for love -" "Be kind and hurry up! I can’t walk around like this, can I -" "Shampooing too - if I may ask!" "I would like to speak to count Edelstjerna!" "Thank you so much for the flowers, my darling -" "- my dear count, I mean!" "But am I not still much too young for marriage?" "May I congratulate you?" "You are invited for supper at our house tonight, and then I will give you my answer!" "Don’t be sad, Astrid!" "But grandmother -" "- she will never give us her consent!" "The ship from Tirania!" "Abduct me!" "Then you don’t love me!" "Tonight at elven o’clock!" "- and hereby given her the rank and dignity of Queen-Mother -" "- with the right to bear the title Royal Highness -" "We are awaiting Their Royal Highnesses on board our ship at midnight!" "Astrid! What if she now has accepted the count and refuses the prince!" "Count Edelstjerna!" "- elopes tonight with the barber assistant on the ship from Tirania!" "Mrs. Svensson - may I wait and hope?" "Yes, you may wait!" "Isn’t it divine! They both enter the ship voluntarily." And just as Romeo once sneaked to Julia - "I bid Your Royal Highness welcome on Tiranian soil." "Hail Nickolo XXIII, King of Tirania." End of fourth act. Fifth act. "Now I see why you wanted to be eloped -" "The simple barber was a better catch than the count!" "Shall I show you that you are doing me wrong?" "Let’s escape one more time!" "We’ll abdicate!" That night there were others who also wanted to go away in a motor boat - "They are probably rogues!" "Get my tool box from the cabin!" "Astrid - Nickolo!" "Astrid - Nickolo!!" "Nickolo-o-o!" "What do you want from me?" "I didn’t mean you - I meant crown prince Nickolo of Tirania!" "But that’s me!" "No, me!" "Me!" "- in that case, who am I?" "You are all scoundrels and imposters!" "Evidence! - You will get some!" "But who are we then, really?" "This scoundrel can tell you an interesting story!" "At the outbreak of the Tiranian revolution -" "- I was president of honor for an orphanage -" "We picked out five baby boys -" "- and we easily found five idiots -" "- sorry! - five patriots -" "- and gave each one of them a crown prince to raise -" "- and for twenty years you have swindled money out of the credulous foster parents!" And yet, Nickolo and André eventually got a kingdom - - where they did write the laws of fashion for their people. "Where is my son-in-law?" "His Royal Highness is shingling -" THE END
