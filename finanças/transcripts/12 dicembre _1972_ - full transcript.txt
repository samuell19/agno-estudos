Milan: 12th December 1970 1 year after the slaughter in Piazza Fontana Milan: 12th December 1970 1 year after the slaughter it's been 1 year since the slaughter here at the Agrarian Bank who do you think it was? -who knows! who knows? would you have anything to tell me about the slaughter? I transported the man who blew up the bank and here's the story the taxi driver told me: I was at the taxi stand when I saw a man come out of the Corso shops a man who was going towards the square he has a suitcase in his hand and was coming to my taxi he said to me "take me to the Agrarian Bank" and I naturally told him, "but the bank is only 100m" you'd be quicker to go by foot but the man opened the door and got into the taxi so naturally I took him in front of the Agrarian Bank [L.Paolucci continues to relate the dialogue he had with the taxi driver Rolandi] I waited in front of the bank for a minute and then he came out I took him where he needed to go and only after half a hour I found out about the explosion at the Bank and in that moment I remember that when he had gone into the Bank he had the suitcase and when he came out he didn't I remembered that he had a very dark face and he spoke a perfect Italian, without accent ?...my advice is that you leave immediately and while leaving he said to me, you met [drove?] me here, and if I go to the police all will be talking about me, radio, television, and at this point I have to say that I'm asking myself if I was a servant of the truth you will ask me why so I will tell you immediately what my doubts are: 1. Why did the police, half an house after ask me if I had asked the taxi driver what the man was wearing why didn't the police question me directly? why did I never meet Rolan? Cornelio Rolandi, sole witness in charge of Valpreda, died 16th july 1971, after 12th dec 1969 8 people had already died, all related to the slaughter no interviews to anyone because during the worse times, even for me [C.Rolandi - Taxi driver] when I was interviewed, it seemed like everyone was helping me but instead nowadays, it's almost 6 months i'm unemployed no one helps me people who came to visit me are friends, journalists haven't come i wait for proposals that are useful to me and family but up to now i have found no one that has made any declaration for the future, even for my son, and i don't know I'm here, a man suspended from eveything Sunday morning, the 14th around 9.30, I don't know, I get a call from the police and not from Pino, saying that Pino was at the station and ill at 14:30 on monday, yet another phone call from the police they said, "your husband has been stopped at the station for check ups" he repeats this again who was asking for Pino's documents [license?] ten minutes later I call saying i'd found it, should I bring it? he says, no Miss, we are coming but where is Pino exactly? - he's here where he is much better at 23:00 a policeman came to get the document at 1:05, of the 16th, journalists came to tell me that Pino had died he said, you know lady, we have a lot to do At my house a policeman came, put his hand on my shoulder and said, lady, come with me and he took me to Dr.Allegra's room who asked me, who are you? I said, I am Pinelli's mother lady, assure the mother of the children, that Giuseppe is not involved in anything we were just following leads from Rome, because of the seriousness of the case when I left I phoned his wife and my daughter assuring them that there was nothing on Pino and telling them what Dr.Allegra had told me. And at an earlier time, when Alice had said she was worried that Pino was too involved in his party... with the anarchists, the movement I observed him a little and said, "Pino be careful because, you know, anarchists not well considered" And he replied to me, "anarchy is not what they taught you when you were a child, it is not violence, we do not want violence and we don't use it". he assured me with those words, and that was the last time I saw Pino in the evening, after the journalists had arrived after Calabresi's reply, which I heard because I was near the phone to hear the reply, I was the first to go to the hospital so a nurse of the hospital took me to an inside room she said, "lady, wait here, are you on your own?", I said, no, I'm waiting for my daughter-in-law while we talk, a nurse (male) comes in and searches for a document and says, "is this the council's certificate?" when I heard that phrase I thought, Pino had died. and the nurse says, "he was brought here in pretty bad shape" they took us to see him, I remember very well and I don't ever want to relive it [Bridge of Ghisolfa Centre - (Anarchist)] At that moment that the Ghisolfa was closing, Pinelli arrives on his motorcycle "Do you want to follow us?" "you know, it's a formal question, no pressure we know you have nothing to do with it" so in that way, a friend Artau go into the car while Pinelli followed on the scooter to the police station. I started to be involved with Giuseppe Pinelli [Milan Courts: first hearing on case of Lotta-Continua - Calabresi] basically one year ago, the same night of the day that he died Pinelli is invited to present himself at the police station and here, during the night between the 12th and 13th that is, between Friday and Saturday they interrogate until the early hours of the morning the second day arrives, Saturday, the night between Saturday and Sunday, Pinelli had stayed in a secured room the next day is the day of the tragedy according to the reconstruction by certain journalists between 23:58, 23:59 and 24:00 hours the body of Pinelli falls in the courtyard of the station he is taken to hospital he arrives some 10 minutes after midnight or 15, or some minutes later he is treated by Dr. Fiorenzano In the rooms of medical visits we were brought a man of about 40 years old whose conditions were extremely serious with no pulse or pressure in the meantime there was a movement of people, even in the medical room the situation was such that to my questions of what happened how did it happen someone explains that Pinelli, during the interrogation, makes a precise murder charge, the phrase was unambiguous someone else in this movement says, "he got up suddenly, went to the window and because of the heat, threw himself out" operations were suspended, Pinelli had finished living. Some say, to enter the history of this case that Pinelli had a sudden impulse [Lawyer Gentini - defending Lotta Continue - continues] that he got up suddenly, threw himself towards the window that he would have climbed the fence hurting himself to his family, to his political ideology, to everything others say, that he went close to the window that with a movement flicked the ash from his cigarette after finishing to smoke to fool the police around him. and then threw himself it was around...23:56 I remember because I looked at my watch because I wanted to get the early edition of the newspaper and when I decided to go, I said bye to my collegues got the newspaper I went as usual by the stairs I lit a cigarette arrived in the courtyard and just in that moment heard the noises something hitting, a shout and then 3 consecutive noises something that fell, hitting twice then the final impact on the ground naturally then there were some muffled noises, two closer, and one further away so much that after, I said, this body that fell, must have hit the two edges Hyphotheses...[?] and they are these: a rough meeting during the interrogation that made the people present think that Pinelli was close to death there in custody, under the eyes, those days, of the whole of Italy in other words, they really sent him to death they chose to drop the anarchist and talk of suicide` rather than put into crisis, with the police of Milan, the whole investigation with the facts of the 12th of December. Another hypothesis: Murder. [Group of workers meeting in the headquarters of the Lotta Continue in Milan] I think, the bombs, were exploded in that moment only because the working class, was going through an excellent period with regard to the socialist movement So that these people, with the support of the government, of the State, exploded these bombs to blame the left, the people who were fighting when it was clear that the murders were fascist and nothing else It was a reply, really, a reply to the advance of the workers The case was in Milan, but within the factories, especially Fiore, the event was immediately understood there were no doubts, that the bombs were put by anarchists or whatever, it was immediately understood that it was fascists even the most unpoliticised worker knew this It was a black thread that tied everything together it tied parliament, the repression of workers, and all these things [Group of ex-partisana of Sarzana] I think that the right position in this direction would be to do towards directors of the Italian State and all the parties to talk about the illegality the affairs of the fascists we are always there It's the Italian state that is fascist how can it talk about laws? Agnelli pays two: pays Colombo and pays Borghese I came home in '45 and in May they were already home they had come home, it was all over and they waited for me because they told me, look, Martini, you suffered there, and we suffered here now let's try and make an Italy with another regime with another system, democratic system, an advanced system get rid of tyranny, remove the monarchy do the reforms, etc...etc... I agreed, I listened to them When we went to the hills, we were a nucleus of people people who fought for an ideal, to really change the situation in Italy. They fooled us They sold what was the partisan movement Things basically were not changing. I saw strikes, strikes started fights started, they started to shoot again, so I said basically "What republic have we made?" When there are deaths, when the police shoot When Togliatti gave amnesty to the fascists What sort of republic have we made, I would say So they would reply "Step by step, step by step" For me, steps were taken but always in the same place so that there must be a hole 2 metres big in these steps that the Communist Party would take to repress marches or to divert them For example, it was seen the elections that took place in Sicily and Calabria and why all those votes for [?] came out It's not because they have just now emerged it's not that they have just become fascist They were fascists before but before they were hidden behind the mask of the D.C. [Christian Democrats] [Colonnata village (in Carrara) - white murders and toxicity] Every year, give or take, about 20 people come, 30..40.. How do people die here? Under blocks of stone, squashed Or some of the accidents have to do with fear to lose their jobs, to lose the company, they have families and kids They go for the dangerous tasks, I won't go, you go... Bosses take advantage of us because the workers need the money, even just 30,000 lire those 30,000 that the son brings, they need it to pay for this and that, so they take more risks When they say, "go and work there" and I see that it's dangerous, I am constrained to go because if I say I won't go, I go home and my father says "now what do we do?" "here we can't even eat" And he takes advantage of us The work we do each day, I work over there It's already seven years that I work with one hand and when one expresses an idea over there that does not appeal to these bosses they are threatened day by day they are threatened when one goes on strike. Look lads, we have to fire 20 or 15 men 15 workers People over here react when there is a deadly accident Here even children react jumping out of bed naked and barefoot each one tries to get inside where the father is who works and brings the bread home They all shout, and go home and tell everyone where they are then they have more of a chance he died here he died there and the whole thing finishes like that you see? Because here, even with the bosses, we can't have contact with them They will always not care about us, so for the usual problem I think the time has come to say "enough" even with rifles you've exploited me until now, now you will give me back all you took to me my father and grandfather Let's listen to the young, I listen to the young because here we are fed up I dream, every night I dream that in the morning something will happen something big, maybe even the revolution There was a time in my team, really tough work So we had an meeting one evening saying "Guys, we need to strike, to ask for a 20 lire increase" The workers, maybe some of these things they don't understand I interrupted this meeting saying it's fair to give them the 20 lire increase but the most important thing is to strike, to put more men, 4 men instead of 3 but we have to let them realise that toxocity isn't removed with money, because work is always hazardous. It is removed with more workers A specific case, where I work these spraying machines last 30 years 30 years ago we used to work in twos now we are 8 or 9, so we spray each other and this provokes TB and illness In a chain production line, where a worker works and does the same movements 8 hours a day Always, from morning to evening, this individual after some time is not capable of discussion certain things or understanding certain things Toxicity is not only the smoke but also is able to repress the complexity of man For me toxicity begins first thing in the morning because I get up at 3.30 and get to work at 5:45i 18 kilometres it was impossible that the parties and those who think they're doing something they should also do those 18 kilometres Because a man that gets up at 3.30 in the morning when I do the first shift, which means I come home at 4 and because of this toxicity, beyond toxicity, also human satisfaction I have to say, are you unemployed? How many unemployed are there? [Pasolini interview with the unemployed of Bagnoli] Who are you protesting against? against who? Against the bosses who exploit us all year round He needs a lot of work How many unemployed are there here? -We are many. How many? about 50 [Naples accent - incomprehensible!] In all these discussion...we go to the employment office to ask for a job A constitutional strike to make national contracts, they throw us out They throw us out for a strike which is constitutional, so then we go to Rome It doesn't exist we went there, me and 5-6 workers we went into a room with 8 of them Mr.Torozzi and 4-5 employees They replied, ok. If you want a place to work you should be ashamed. You in this room should because it's only 8 people talking to the representiatives of the unemployed in Naples! The problem with kids, like this kid here the problem of kids is that all in all in a family of 8, where they earn 15,000 lire because they can't even eat This is the fight, the fight of the young ["La lotta, dura, senza paura!"] ["The tough fight, without fear!"] Reggio Calabria [southern state] 1970 The fight for main town The anger against bosses a piece of watch or something There's no work, there's nothing everyone, all these guys are dying of hunger -Why?- Look at our condition! In these shacks, the rats eat you People who support the strikes are mostly poor people They would descend to get beaten or killed, to get actually killed while the bosses sat in their balconies to see the spectacle and make fun of us When there were fights between youth and police There was an old woman with her shopping bag who went to and fro picking bringing back thrown stones When we heard that story about the bombs we fled -You escaped?- Some older friends had sea-masks they put on and ran away They would have vans following behind them, they would shoot every 15-20 blocks They would even shoot bullets On their return they would find another barricade and again, until they were forced to not enter St.Katherines because they would die - I was so scared! They didn't come in the nights, because it was scary -The police were scared?- Yes, because the lights were all broken here We let the police pass over the bridge, but they managed to get past the barricade at St.Katherines then we held them back -You did the republic?- Yes we did the republic with barricades Then we blocked it completely to not let the police pass at all In each group there were about 100 of us, 150 but united we were about 500 -A large battle?- Large because in the end.... -And who won? We won because the police didn't go beyond the barricade They would punch, spitting in the mouth, they would make the prisoners drink salt water they would make them go up stairs and trip them over to break their teeth If we were just 4 hoodlums as the TV said, why did they send in an army? Why did they send 8000 police and carabinieri Then they stopped me and I said "don't arrest me, don't beat me, I'm an invalid" They beat me, the ripped up my certificate and other things The president of one of the occupied schools, found and documented with photos these things Things that had been left behind they would take all these things before loading There were reasons for leaving, totally valid reasons for the protest But on the other hand one has to realise that there was a certain manipulation by people by people who have particular interests on Reggio and on the question of "Capoluogo" [main town] The population did not identify these elements that were used for that were used for provocation or manipulation Shut up a second! I wanted to say that... There was... -It's true, it's true! The population combated and fought and the same people have returned to power in the municipality and province We want the "capoluogo" and that's all!, it will come, thanks anyway! If they won't give it to us, we will take it by power But I agree with you! We were not pushed by anyway, we went down into the square [piazza] But I'm saying that the ideal reasons are totally valid it's only that there was some people who took advantage of this. Let him speak! No one exploited us, no one! We descended into the piazza, not for the rich but we descended for us, for the "capoluogo" Who tells you that after all you've done, you went to prison, the other to hospital, that those to benefit this shouldn't be us?.... [A worker of the Pirelli factory speaks] This is the complicity of the Community Party` Where there was hunger, there was desperation, and the fascist took advantage of this When the proletariat is taken over by desperation terrible things can happen I have to say of the 100 clients I have, 99 of them are southern and a Piedmontese, this is true isn't it? They come here to work, hoping to make a house, when they arrive they put them in barracks near Porta nuova, they don't have a house, they don't have anything When you have 100 workers like that, find them a house, give them what they need Otherwise what do these people do? I am willing, in any moment, I am old but I am an old fighter, I am a revolutionary and I am for sweeping away...to get rid of the bosses They should go away, they should never be seen again Here you become a robot, not a human any more and you have a wife and kids Here instead you become a robot you know that in the morning at 3:40 you have to wake up and go to work you have to produce, produce and produce The bosses exploit us from the morning to the evening The owner Agnelli, who is he? who is he? He's the one who exploits us no? We get 100,000 lire of salary while outside the cost of life is how much? -And it's Agnelli who exploits you?- Of course it is, of course Listen - who increases production here? If you found yourself face to face with Agnelli what would you do? -I'd shoot him! Immigrants are not only those who come from the south to work to find a better place it is also a worker from here, a farmer from here who is exploited! I love my Sicily so I... If I could return, I would return there Sicily is beautiful but I think it's beautiful only for holidays She is well here, there are no entertainments in Sicily there really aren't She got the habit of people in Turin well, here I found another style of life It's small but I like everything.../ The film you have seen was shot between the end of 1970 and the beginning of 1972` A long time ago The film has been restored, cut and remounted thanks to the collaboration of Enzo Ocone of the authors and Pasolini Foundation The original version is stored in the archives of the Pasolini Foundation ----------------------------------- Subs by twigdip twigdip at yahoo dot com nov 2nd 2008
