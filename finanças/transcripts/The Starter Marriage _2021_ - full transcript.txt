[whooshing and rumbling] [light whimsical music] [lightly tense music] [sniffing] Trijah. My heaven-sent princess. Would you make me the happiest man in the world by marrying me? Oh, Trenton. I declare, I don't know what to say! Did you hear what I said? Trijah. Trijah! Cut! Trijah, darling. You still don't know your lines. [kooky music] Opening night is three days away. I know, I'm sorry. Whenever Trenton looks up to my eyes I just get all flustery. That's because he's giving his all to the role. Just like Brando did when I worked with him on Broadway. [chuckling] You worked with Marlon Brando? Ew, heavens no, that charlatan. Brando Horowitz, at the On Broadway Truck Stop Cafe in the Appallachian Mountains. [giggling] Mmm. Everyone, take five. I'm sorry. Visiting Trijah world again? Hey, I likr Trijah world. We're both married and our kids were the president and vice president. Yeah? No? [Mark] Hey, Pete-o! You're late, Marko, again. Work? Hard work never killed anybody, but I'm not taking any chances. Sorry, sorry, I... [Group] Had to work late. Even on Saturday. What did I miss? Well, his divorce is final today. And his philosophy on how marriage was invented by a mad scientist in a government lab whose sole purpose is to drive men insane. Sounds like a classic. Mark, Mark, meet my friend over there. Hi. Anything else? Well, my husband hasn't said anything stupid enough yet to get him a room at Hotel Le Couch, so... Stay tuned. We haven't reached halftime yet. [glasses clinking] So how you doing, buddy? I still love Vicky. Mm-mm. You were too good for her. Yes, man. No, no, I wasn't. I'm a fricking douche rod. She was an angel, man. No. She burned your car. - Mm. - Right. And slept with your business partner. Yeah. She did that so she could become a better lover for me. He does not believe it. She told you that? Yeah, every time I caught them together. Dude, didn't she get you fired from your own business? [Erika] Hey Mark. Hmm? Where's Amanda? I think she was trying to kill me. Hi, Amanda. Hey, I forgot to tell you earlier that I won't be able to make our date tonight. [Amanda] What, are you afraid? No, no, not afraid. Bungee spelunking could be fun. [Amanda] But you missed our last date. Yes, yes, I remember, I missed our last date too, but... [Amanda] You're just scared. No, no, not scared. But seriously, what kind of a zoo allows people to do yoga with bears? [Amanda] Modern progressive zoos do. Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Mark. How many times did y'all go out? Four times, including the blind date - that I wasn't able to make. - Mmm, that's too bad 'cause date four, that's the sex date. Oh! No, no, no, I'm pretty sure it's the fifth. Oh, he's cute. Key of E flat. [duo vocalizing] ♪ Happy divorcio to you ♪ ♪ Happy divorcio to you ♪ ♪ Happy divorcio, stupido ♪ ♪ Happy divorcio to you ♪ Yay! [laughing] That was so good! [kooky music] It's okay. Sometimes you kiss a lot of frogs to find a prince. That is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. You don't go to a toad ranch searching for a hippo, jeez. Go back to your book, okay? Tara, there are other eels in the sea. You're taking this awfully well. Wait, did you win this time? I guessed six weeks on the money, uh huh. Yes, but I won the last three times before that. This is my life. Hey. You'll find the right person someday, okay? And you'll be happily married just like us. And your sister, your brother, Aunt Breezsha, Cousin Mokita. Cousin Mokita. And then you can move out of my house so I can turn the basement into my man cave. We don't even have a basement. Oh, hush father. Pay him no mind, okay? You can stay here as long as you pay your share of the rent on time. Every time I think about getting married, a picture of your wedding day pops in my head. Yeah, and? And then I think, I'm never getting married. Whatever. If I was in charge of the department of getting married, I would make everyone have to get a marriage permit in order to get a marriage license. Like a permit to drive a car? Exactly. Everyone would have to do like 8700 hours worth of practicing to be married in order to take the marriage test and then get your marriage license. Yeah, there you go. Come on buddy. Yeah, yeah, go straight, go straight. And I'll back you in, go straight, yeah. Yeah don't forget the shoes. That way. [body thudding] Ooh! [phone buzzing] So how's he doing? Passed out like a baby in Vicky's laced panties. [gasping] She told me he did that. Wish someone would have told me. Well, if you need anything, call Luke. I'm going to bed. See you Friday night for charades? I don't know if I'll be able to make it. I'll see you Friday night, seven sharp for charades. - I'll try to- - I'll see you Friday night, seven p.m. sharp for charades. Friday, seven sharp, I'll be there. Good. Kay, bye. Say bye, Luke. Bye, Luke. I didn't say "say 'Bye Luke'", I said "say 'Bye', Luke". Bye, Mark. It's baloney. I fried it. Thank you. Bye, comma, Erika. We'll cut our rates by 40 percent if you buy advertising with us. Well, just give us a chance to... Hello? Hello? Dammit. They went with Kong Radio over us. I should have stuck with the Hawaiian country folk format. It's lit. I was sure Gavin Beers would buy advertising with us. It makes sense, we have more listeners. Water under the toaster, we can't run unless we make horrific mistakes like you just did. [kooky music] You know what we should do? Put ecoli in the Gavin Beers and when K.O.N.G. drops them, charge advertising at triple the price? No. We should go after their number one competitor. Logan Microbrews. Oh, my Steely Dan, you're so right. Make the call. Two steps ahead of you, boss. No, you're not, you're sitting down. [bright music] [doorbell dinging] Hey, Patricia. Is my dad here? You know my name is Eileen. Why do you keep doing this? I'm sorry, it's just that your name is so similar to my dad's fifth wife. Patricia, Patricia, Eileen. So close. I'll wake him. Jose. [lightly somber music] Marky Mark. What are you doing here so early? Coffee, latte, Bloody Mary? All of the above? I'll just take a water, dad. [Dad speaks in foreign language] Look, you have got to stop calling me dad. I am hardly the father figure these days. Look at me as one of your lit homies. So what's the hap, the biz, the 311? Don't you usually come by for dinner instead of breakfast? I noticed Ma's picture was no longer on the wall of fame. Makes Eileen uncomfortable. That's why you stopped talking about Ma? It makes her uncomfortable? It's complicated. You two were happy, right? Absolutely. You think you'd still be together if she was still alive? What's going on? You are way too young for the "Why am I here, where did I come from" phase of life. I'm thinking of getting married. Hey! Mark's getting hitched! Break out the expensively cheap champagne! Get it yourself. So who is she? I don't know yet. You remember Keith? Your old college roommate? Mhmm. - You're marrying him? - Hmm. I thought there was something about him. What, no. Hey, whatever floats your yacht. It's not him. His divorce is final. You're a rebound? No. Booty call? Dad, stop. As I was saying, Keith had this brilliant idea that everyone should have a starter marriage. To make all the mistakes the first time so they can have a successful marriage the second time. I'm thinking of doing that. Why? I have this master plan for my 20s. Got my college degree at 21, become the marketing executive for a kick ass radio station by 26, buy a home at 27. By 28- - So would this be an actual marriage? Of course. With all the benefits and struggles. That's why I wanted to pass it by you, a marriage expert. More of a divorce expert than a marriage expert. Know more about what makes them fail than succeed. That's the 311 I'm looking for. Okay. I'll have my secretary send over a list of mistakes my wives made first thing tomorrow. How long you plan this experimentation going? One year, like an internship, so I can gain the necessary experience for the real full-time marriage. Okay. When you find your future ex-wife, stop by the office and we'll draw up the paperwork. Great. When I get married for real, I wanna have a happy union just like you and mom did. I hope you do too, son. [jazzy music] [sighing] Man, what is so urgent that you interrupted my Cake Wars marathon? Through dogged research, I have compiled a list of the most common problems that lead to divorce. During the year's time, said participants will do every wrong thing to ensure that this starter marriage will not work. Upon completion, the participants will have gotten every wrong action out of the way and will be prepared for the second marriage. And now, for the objectives. Fight over money, sex, not enough sex, poor communication, lack of trust, lying, dishonesty, coming home late, being distant, forgetting birthdays and anniversaries, the silent treatment, don't get along with family, don't like friends, jealousy, holding on to grudges, liking Instagram pics, commenting on Instagram pics, - following Instagram pics. - Whoa, whoah. Where did you get this list? Mostly the internet. Oh, and my dad's six marriages. And Luke and Erika. And of course, you. Well you forgot one. What? Not caring about the other person's feelings. Oh, that's a good one. I'll add that later. You think it's karma? I think men are idiots. And eventually he'll get what's coming to him. I can actually speed that up if you'd like me to. No, no thank you. I'm just gonna go home and watch The Real Housewives and dream of something I'll never be. A skank? No! A real housewife, ugh. Well, my friends and I are playing charades tonight. You wanna come? It'll take your mind off being dumped. I do crush at charades. Come on, we need another woman. I can't. I have to go home and listen to my parents argue over who's gonna be the next bachelorette. Tara. We're playing men versus women. Come on. You know you wanna go, come on. Fine, I'll come, I'll come. Okay, first word. Is it taking a pill? Vicodin, Zoloft. Organic spirulina? What? Gingko biloba? [snapping] Female Viagra! Okay. Aspirin. Okay. Second word. - [Mark laughing] - Gas? Gas? Aspirin gas? As gas, asparagus? - Okay, asparagus. - Asparagus, Asparagus. [Trijah And Erika] Stalking the Wild Asparagus! [women laughing] Yes, ladies win again! Suck on it, boys. [Chloe] Fellas gotta make dinner next week, yes! Haha, and no corndogs on paper plates this time. Guys! Guys. [clears throat] I have an announcement to make. I've been thinking all week about Keith's theory on first marriages. Oh no. In preparing for a marriage that will last a lifetime, I have decided to get married for one year, make all the mistakes that destroy marriages, just to get them out of the way and learn from them. Okay, did you put him up to this? Absolutely not. I even created a business plan with goals, market analysis, and timelines. Come on guys, I know this can work. It sounds romantic. Why not just live together? No, have to be married, no easy escape clause. Hmm, people do act differently once they get that ring on your finger. Okay, okay. Look, Erika and I lived together at first. And then afterwards, everything changed after the I dos. I went from being Mr. Wonderful to being Mr. Work In Progress. Okay, stop while you're still married, - all right? - Hey, I'm just saying. - I'm just saying. - Look, I agree with you. If you want to experience married life, you need to actually be married. Have you found the lucky lady yet? Not yet. [chuckling] FYI, you can't return a mail order bride. [Luke laughing] I'm just saying. That's a good one. Well, who the hell else is gonna want a starter marriage for a year and then a starter divorce on their permanent record? Good point, good point. A prostitute. - Yeah. - I'm just saying. Someone who's strapped for cash and still lives at home with their parents. - Are you paying, that's... - Uh huh. No. The only incentive is that they will be prepared for the perfect marriage after the divorce, of course. Definitely someone who has given up all hope on ever getting married. Well what do you think, Tara? [Tara coughing] What you say? What type of person do you think could help Mark out with this starter marriage thing? A fool. Oh. Aha! - Here here. - She just got here. You know, I like her. I told you you would. Welcome. There walks a fool. - You move like I said. - Absolutely, absolutely. I mean, it's gonna be good. - I'll take care of it. - Get a different turtleneck. - I thought you loved this. - Just go before you miss her and have an accident - or something. - Come on our show's - coming up, bye y'all. - All right. I have your cell phone, your work phone, your junk email, work email, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and Myspace. Myspace? It could make a comeback. And I have your cellphone number. Perfect. I'll give you a call if I can think of anyone. Thank you. Oh, and by the way, what was your name again? It's Trijah, but you can call me Tara, T, Tisha, Tri, Tameka, Tina. Okay, goodnight. Tri? Goodnight, Mark. So, man. You got any prospects to be your wife? Not yet. Every person I meet online is either a nanny or a Nigerian exchange student. Oh. You can ask my cousin. That's okay. Why not? 'Cause. 'Cause what? 'Cause I don't wanna marry your cousin. But dude, then we could be cousins. Don't wanna be your cousin. Why not? 'Cause. 'Cause what? Oops. 'Cause I just wanna be your friend. You think my cousin's ugly, don't you? Man... What are you talking about? I know you think she's ugly. Because you have dated everyone but my cousin. And every time I bring her up you always say no. Well that's only because I'm... I'm looking out for... I'm looking out for our friendship, bro. Yeah, you and me. We become family, then we have family problems. See what I'm saying? Ah. That's love, dog. Come here. Bring it in here. Oh, no, nice. [Keith] Come on. Will you give me the honor, then... [crowd applauding] Air dry? Air dry. Yes, very good. [laughing] Oh, goodness, oh look look look. There he goes again. What's wrong with her? I don't know. Trijah, Trijah, honey? Eh? Hey, what's wrong? What happened? I went to go watch the play. It was that bad? No. It was good! So why are you crying, hmm? Because Trenton and that she-witch, they're dating now. [sighing] First she takes my part then she takes my boyfriend and now she has my fantasy! Well. Trijah. You can't remember your lines. I'm dyslexic! Oh, honey. You're not very good. Okay, acting was just something to get you out of the house so your father and me could play Gray's Anatomy. You told me that I would win an Oscar someday. Ah, I said you could win a man named Oscar someday. [whining] Why does my life suck so bad? Honey, face it. You are meant to stay here with us until we die. [kooky tense music] [laughing] I'm just kidding. Hey, you hungry? I made your favorite. Lentil soup served over brown rice, and some curried vegetables, hmm? Oh, and Adam, he brought your favorite bean pie from the neighbors. Thank you, Mom. Okay, I'll be right back, okay? Oh. Can I also have two slices of that bean pie? Okay. [Trijah sighing] Here you go, sweety. Ah! We're not dead yet. Adam is close, so be nice. Hey, Mark. This is Trijah, the one you met at the charades last night, yeah. Yeah, I was just wondering. Did you find anybody to do the whole marriage thing with you? [bright music] [train horn blowing in distance] [door clacking] Sorry I'm late, Ricky. Thought you changed your mind. Of course not. Wait, you call your dad Ricky? Huh? [Trijah] Should I call you Ricky or dad? Dollface, you can call me whatever you want. Now, I took the liberty of drafting up some paperwork. I have your prenup, I have your wedding license and a post-nup, AKA divorce papers. Now your prenup is dated today your wedding license for tomorrow, and your post-nup, a year and a day from today. I just need some signatures on those. [light kooky music] So, what time is the wedding? - In the morning. - In the afternoon. Miscommunication. Your marriage is off to a blissful start. I'll make some copies. [suspenseful music] [phone ringing] [yawning] Did my text wake you up? I was watching TV. I hope you don't mind me calling you. I text really slow. Are we crazy? Probably, but who cares? I haven't told anyone yet. I'm gonna tell my parents after we get married. I think I'll save all my telling for after the divorce. I don't know, maybe you're right. It's just always been so difficult for me, you know, I'm just a hopeless single. And my parents and siblings are the fricking After this year, you'll never have that problem again. We will never have that problem again. Mmm, my dad's been married so many times I really have no problem living up to marriage pressure. I just don't want to compete with him on the divorce side. Well, let's show them that we can ruin the marriage with the best of them. I'm in. I do have to tell you something before we get married. I snore obnoxiously loud. Okay. I'm always late. I spend a lot of time in the bathroom and I've seen every episode of every series of Star Trek that's ever been on television. Uh-uh, the marriage is off if you own a pair of Spock ears. My turn. I eat the toast inside out. I love peanut butter and Worcestershire sauce on my popcorn. And every time I watch an emotional Disney movie it kind of turns me on. I sing and dance in the shower while listening to Yanni's greatest hits. And then I put soap on the bottom of my feet so I can dry off like a speedskater. [Trijah laughing] [door knocking] Gotta go. Oh. [birds chirping] Another minute, I would have had myself another wife. Pops, you're already married. I said another. And yeah, she's Muslim, she's from India. You do not wanna say that. And plus I'm actually practicing Hinduism and I'm from Nepal so that makes me Nepali. But I thought that- - Please. I need to get this over with and get back to work. Not the one that showed up late, wet britches. Ha, made you look! Where's the judge? You sure you wanna do this? I do. And do you, tshh.... I do. And for you. Excuse me? She does. Okay. For better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do you part. [motorcycle revving in distance] Wait, do you mean like physical death or could it be a spiritual thing? Or even a karmic death, you know? Something like thou end in a soul- - Do you or don't you? And whatever kind of death you prefer. I do. Good. You may kiss your whatever she is. Thanks, your honor. Oh, thank you. See you at the club Saturday. [Judge] All right. I gotta get back to work. Oh. So you're trying to get me to spend $100,000 to advertise on your radio station and your pitching me with a $10 flip chart from Staples? It was actually $13.99. Sir, sir, sir. I promise that we can reach your primary target audience and offer programming benefits that fit your brand better than any radio station in this market. Continue. You don't need a fancy expensive presentation to get your point across. You need effective, strategic marketing to grow your customer base. That is what we offer here at King. Trained him myself. But we want him on our account. [chair squeaking] So, have you thought about tonight? Tonight? The honeymoon. [Trijah] Oh, no, I do not know we had to do that. Got your file over here. Plus it'll feel like having a one night stand with a guy I just met at a night club. Excuse me, what's wrong with that? Sorry, had a off-site appearance with the new jock. Well, your timing is perfect. Everything's moved in. Oh. How about pizza for everyone? I already got that. Is there anything I could do? You could say bye 'cause we're done. Time to let you two lovebirds spank the old cowhide, baby. All right, okay, let's go before I spank your cowhide. Promises, promises. Say bye bye. Well I love you both. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. But if you do, you should record it and then send it to me HD. 'Cause you know I got that new 4K TV. And my Pornhub subscription is canceled now. So I need something. [door clacking] Again, I'm sorry. No problem, I've got a lot of unpacking to do. Wait, hold on. There's something I want to show you. Please have a seat. [whooshing] You are kidding me. This has got to be a joke, right? Tri, thank you for coming today. The purpose of this meeting is to strategize- - [clears throat] Question, should I be taking notes? Thank you, Mr. Reardon. So, I have put together a list of all the wrong actions that we need to do this year to make sure this marriage will not work. Where'd you get this list? It's just a start. We can add stuff later. Yeah, I can definitely think of a few right about now. Yeah, that's great. Look, I'll just start from the beginning. These are the goals, and here, all right, we have the objective mission statement and we- [boxes clattering] Too soon? [ominous music] [tape ripping] Too much. Can we finish this tomorrow? I have an early morning. I have to give a new client a station tour. I thought we were gonna take the rest of the week off? I never agreed to that. It's our honeymoon. So? So? So I took the rest of the two days off. Mhmm. You know what? I'm fine, I don't even care, whatever. No, no. That's my side. Your half's over there. I already cleaned it out for you. Why can't we put the dishes together? It'll make it easier when you move out later. And since you're left handed, I gave you the left half of everything. The cabinets, bathroom, sink, the bedroom drawers and the left side of the bed too. You can sleep on the left or right side of the couch for all I care. We just had our first fight. We did. How'd that feel for you? Like you were really pissed at me. I was. I just felt you dismissed my feelings. I did, yeah. Huh, this actually might work out. - [music lightening] - Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Up top? Ah, okay. Mahalo, punk rocker. Before you rock out, let Logan know we're changing our format to 24 hours Cash Money rap. You heard? Heard what? We're changing our format to Cash Money rap. Why are we changing formats again? Times are changing, ti's all about that cream. Cream? Cash, moolah, gouda. Right. How long have you been married? [kooky music] Going on 22 years. And me and my old lady rarely talk. Is that why you work late? I work late in order to save our marriage, for rizzle. I don't know. I think this whole marriage thing was a mistake. Have you talked to your parents about it? Are you serious, hm? [Adam] What is this? It's a wedding. I mean, I got married. You had a wedding? Without us? Really? It's not a real marriage. - What? - What's, what? Well it's real, but we're - only gonna be- - Is it a real boy? I signed a contract. - You signed a prenup, is this like a trick, is he rich? - No. - It's called starter marriage. - What are you talking about? [Adam] You're married or you're not married. This makes no sense. I'm married for a year. Do you need medication? What is going on with you? We need to talk to the doctor. I don't know what is going on with her. Let me explain it to you. Let me explain it to you, okay? I get married for a year and get all the mistakes out the way so the next marriage, I can have the happy one like you and dad. I'm very disappointed. Nobody gets married for one year, really? [Kyrah] That makes no sense at- - [Adam] You get married for life, till death do us part. Yes, but this is until a year is up. This doesn't make any sense. Because this is what you guys wanted, right? You wanted me out of the house so you can have your man cave, right? And you wanted me to get married like Cousin Mokita, remember? I do want my man cave. Shut up about your man cave, okay? How could you, [speaks in foreign language] You should be ashamed of yourself, huh? What kind of daughter are you, huh? You don't even tell your father or me that you are getting married? You should be ashamed of yourself. This is not how you do things. [Kyrah] She is not my daughter, she is your daughter. - Oh, now it's my daughter. - No, it's not mine. - No. - Oh really? Now it's my daughter. - Oh. - Yeah. - This is millennial stuff. - This is what happens. - This millennial stuff - These millennials. - They talk about. - Yes yeah. [Kyrah] You're one of them now. They think I'm going through an early midlife crisis. [laughing] You're just 26. Exactly. My mom says that it could be bad karma for my ancestors. Well my ancestors must have really tripped out, all the shit I've been through. And even I wouldn't do this stupid experiment, so. Sorry, T. [sighing] No, it's okay, you're right. Well, just get a divorce like everybody else. I mean, you've lasted longer than Kim Kardashian and that basketball player dude that she married. Nope. We both signed a contract and either one of us can sue if the other breaks the deal. [excited music] How exciting. [doorbell ringing] You know what, maybe they just forgot about tonight. - Let's just go. - Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. - Hey! - Hi, Tri. Javier. Constance, always good to see you. Hey, you have a wonderful bar montage. - I love your hair. - Thank you. [kooky music] Right baby, that's fine. [Ricky] Did you do something different with you hair? I combed it. Ah. Love that perfume. Is it called Tarzan, 'cause it's driving me jungle wild. How's the marriage going? You'd be proud of us. Be proud of her, not you. Sorry I forgot to call you back last night, I was busy. Ah, totally understand. I'd be busy too if I had this hot tigress at home. [Trijah coughing] Dad! [fist banging] More wine, anyone? Here. [kooky music] Well I thought the evening went well. Oh, really? You do know that is my dad, right? Like your father-in-law? Yeah, I mean, he was just making me feel at home. He practically offered you his home. I don't appreciate you flirting with him. I wasn't. Are you jealous? Pssh, I've never been jealous a day in my whole entire life. First time for everything. You should be jealous. Why is that? It's on your list. Plus it's one of the top four reasons marriages end in divorce, a jealous spouse. Good. We can cross it off the list. [light music] [ducks quacking] How often do the squirrels come for you to feed them anyway? Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. Well today must be a don't day. Kind of like love. Ooh, speaking of, how's the marriage going? It's an experiment. But you know, I've been thinking. An experiment, it should be accurate and unbiased so it doesn't create a false positive or false negative. Impressive. I know, I watched the talk show of couples therapy. And if I am going to sacrifice a whole year of my life, we're gonna do this the right way. Ooh, just remember, HD. Mark, I'm home. Where have you been? We've already done the coming home late. I was having sex with another man doing the adultery part of the list. Adultery's not on the list. You want me to add it? Come on, sit, sit. What is this? This is the addendum to our starter marriage contract titled "The For Better Articles." That whole point is so much better. I know. Okay so just in case you've never heard these words before, they are part of the wedding vows. Titled "For Better or Worse." Okay, so to have a proper experiment you need to have the controlled group and an experimental group to have a more accurate and truthful determination of your hypothesis, right? What in the name of Bill Nye are you talking about? Just like you left adultery off your list, you also left off in times of sorrow and in times of joy. In times of failure, and in times of triumph. Okay, I get the idea. But for the record, in my research I found that a lot of that stuff on my list preceded adultery and abuse, so maybe - it could have weighed- - Okay, to broaden the scope of our experiment, I have added the for better objectives. Honesty, date nights, being romantic, being affectionate, communication, sharing the past, doing something special for the other. There's more. Making the other feel extraordinary, passion, doing things we have in common and unbridled passion. Passion is on your list twice. Passion and unbridled passion are two very different things. How so? You'll learn. Anyway, so you see what I mean, right? We need to do both lists. Let's make the mistakes on your list, but let's also practice what makes a marriage work on mine too? This is a great idea. Yeah? Yeah. Ooh, okay! [light guitar music] Here is the table you requested. Thank you. Please. [gentle music] Oh, lah dee dah, look at this. I emailed the chef and I already ordered for us. [Mark clapping] [Waiter] Your flowers. Are these for me? Thank you. I was hoping that this would make you feel special. It does. Thank you. [Mark clapping] Another thing off the list. What just happened? I just took care of two things on your list. Date night and doing something special for the other. [sighing] So you're telling me all of this was just to check things off my list? Exactly. I thought we were just on a normal date. Why would we do that? Just because. Hmm. So what kind of marriage do you want your second marriage to be? Like my mom's and my sister, and my cousin and brother, and everybody else in my family. You know there's this interview with Anne Bancroft and her husband Mel Brooks. They suddenly drive into the driveway and she looks at the reporter, smiles, and she says "Now the fun begins." What about you? My parents were very happy before my mom died. How old were you? Seven. I wish I remember more about her, but... You know what kind of wedding you wanna have? Yeah. [laughing] It's gonna be somewhere deep in the forest. And you know how I love animals so I'm gonna put some food out hoping they're gonna join us. And maybe the squirrels and the mice will help me make my dress. That's a Disney thing. - Oh. - Disney, cartoon. Disney. [Trijah laughing] I had a really good night. You should text me, fax me, email me or DM me on Facebook. We should do this again sometime. Good night. Oh, oh. [clears throat] Thank you for going out with me tonight and I too hope we can do this again soon. Kiss me or shake my hand. [passionate piano music] Was this on the list? Good night. [knob clicking] [Trijah sighing] [gentle music] Hey, wait wait wait. I thought we were spending the rest of the day together. After gym with the guys. Was that on the list? If not, I apologize. I meant to put it on there. Wait, what time will you be back? When we're done. Okay, hey, hey, hey. How about I plan something nice and special for us tonight? What was wrong with what we did last night? Nothing. Last night was great. Then why do we need to do it again? [light music] We had a romantic dinner waiting, wine, flowers, and she still wasn't thrilled. Dude, she wasn't thrilled because you took them all back. Well it's just an experiment, right? Bro, never just experiment where a female is concerned. Right. Look, man, they take this relationship stuff serious and you should too. If you really want this stupid experiment of yours of having any chance of really working, which I seriously doubt. Yeah I told you this was stupid. I'm taking it serious. That's why we did all that stuff. That was on her list. Yeah, but then you took it back, man. Right, so it never really happened. Look, man. If you really want this experiment of yours to work, you're gonna have to get dirty. Dirty? Yeah, look. Brother you're gonna have to immerse yourself in it. Like for real? For real, for real. Look, me and Erika had our problems, and we ain't perfect, but we both get immersed. Immersed? Immersed. You just learn that word or something? No, why? - Why in the hell do you keep saying it like that? - [scoffing] Look, man. All I'm saying is that you got to get, you know, you gotta get into it. Immersed? Yeah, immersed. Hey, fellas. Look, check it out. Do something from her For Better list, have sex, and then do something from your For Worse list, and? Have sex. Yes, exactly. So make love and war simultaneously. Absolutely. [barbell clunking] [Keith] Help. [Mark] How did you get tickets to this? It's not what you know, it's who you know. That's what's up. You know, it's so cool that we both love movies. Something we have in common, and that's on the list. Check. [Attendant] Hi, may I help you? Trijah Reardon plus one. Wanna go get some popcorn and a drink? There's only one ticket in here. How can that be? There should be two. Sorry, there's only one. You go ahead, you love Star Trek. Only the person who's name is on the ticket can go in. [Mark] You go. Are you sure? Yeah. Okay. [Attendant] Excuse me, sir. Next? Excuse me. [kooky music] [crowd chattering] [Man] They say it was like the best movie ever. Hey. You okay? You evil person. You did that on purpose. I did no such thing, okay? You wanna see? Here. You happy? You know what, just take me home. Tri. I'm sorry for thinking you did that. I never had any woman do thoughtful things for me, just because, I mean, they always had an agenda. But not you. I'm really sorry.

All Elvis, all the time. This station's got a whole lotta lovin going on except for Logan who canceled his contract. It's time to short-rate that teddy bear for breaking our contract. That'll just anger him. Don't care. A deal's a deal. What happened? He loved his commercials. It shook me up too. When's the last time you talked to that hound dog in disguise? Recently. He tells me that he hasn't heard from you. He feels he's been ignored ever since he agreed to advertise. I've been busy. - [kooky music] - Hello? My blue suede shoe tells me that you've been too busy in this make believe marriage. You're caught in a trap and can't wiggle your way out. You're right. I'll go get Logan back. You better. He's staying at the Heartbreak Hotel down at Graceland Boulevard till Friday. Congratulations. 'Cause I heard you got married. Mark has left the building. Thank you, thank you very much. Tara, you are not keeping me updated. What's the card say? Let's see. It says thank you. [shrieking] Things must be going well. They are, they are. Ooh, is there any video? No. This is a lot better. Whatever. Just don't get caught up. No, you... I see, got your little glow glow going there. Mm-mm. We're staying focused at the task at hand.

Oh, you would show the ring, - how cute. - You see it? Yeah, whatever. I just can't believe you got him to go grocery shopping, - What? - And buy tampons. - Like that is so cute. - Let me tell you. Yeah he was calling me from the tampon aisle. He was like, hey, do you want curved, winged or quilt size? What is a quilt size? Really, even after that whole Star Trek snafu? Right. I told y'all, that wasn't her fault. She showed me the email for the RSVP. Let me know if you need a second dose of "Oh, there's only one ticket." [chuckling] Wait, I meant to ask you about that. Wasn't there supposed to be two? Uh huh, there was. Erika. [laughing] Girl's crazy. So that was you? You were the one that was telling me about the whole "Immerse yourself in it." That was before I found out that Erika was involved. Now I'm telling you that you need to get out. Get out, bro. I felt so bad. He thinks I did that on purpose. Why you didn't give me the ticket? - I would have took the ticket. - Honey, it's a casualty of war. That's true. I don't believe it. Look, she told me herself. She's wrong. She said that they set that whole thing up in order to gain control of your good times and bad times over your marriage, bro. And Erika is never wrong. Turn this way. Can you believe that? Yeah, I can, it's Erika. You wanna win, right? We do want the dub. - Yup. - Mhmm. Try these. You'll be okay. Much better, those are loud. She told you this? As sure as I'm dead if she finds out I told you, yeah. [Erika] Oh boys, ready to get your butts kicked again? Coming, dear. Ah, shoot. Well that was fun tonight. Yup. I have no idea how Erika guesses those crazy answers. She's an evil genius. [tense kooky music] Is something wrong? Nope. What's this? It's my way of saying I'm sorry. Sorry for what? I don't know. I must have done something for you to not talk to me all night. I'm fine. Coffee? [door slamming] Ooh, gotta go. And he didn't say anything? Not a word. He's just giving you the silent treatment until he can come up with something cunning or deceitful so that he can take back control of the marriage. No, I think the silent treatment is actually on his list, which he put right back up. He took it down? Yes. But when I left this morning it was back up. Not good. Start stacking up on your rations 'cause it's about to be a war. [phone buzzing] Um, what do I do? It's him. Answer it, but be chill, 'cause... Chill, okay. Hello. [clears throat] Chill. Hey babe. There you go. Yeah, I'm free. Okay, I'll see you tonight. So? So, he wants to take me out tonight. [shrieking] Yes, that is my boy! Pete-o! Hey, Marko! [laughing] Ah, Pete-o, this is my wife Tri. Tri, this is Pete. Careful, he bites. [laughing] I heard you tied the knot, but I didn't believe it. Nice to meet you, Tri. Nice to meet you too. Now this is a very special night. He's never brought a woman here. And I was beginning to worry about him just a little. [Trijah chuckling] You know it means a lot, you bringing me here tonight. I thought you were mad at me. Mad at you about what? I don't know. You've been giving me the silent treatment since last night. Thank you. I said either you're a sore loser or it's your time of the month. What, men have them too, don't trip. Oh, I never trip. Ever. Mmm, but then I remembered your list. Silent treatment is on there. Huh. Actually, I wasn't even thinking about that. At all. Just us. You sure? I saw it was back up when I left this morning. I wanted to share something with you. Sharing a personal story. I'll make sure to check that off the list. I miss my mom every day. [somber piano music] I have learned to accept that feeling of missing her. That's good, I guess. I just hope she's proud of how I turned out. She is. What happened to her? Heart disease. She died three weeks after doctors diagnosed her. I'm so sorry. Thank you. Okay, my turn. I... You do honesty. That is at the top of your list, right? Okay. Mark. I'm in love with you. That's not on the list. I thought you felt the same way. This isn't about feelings. This is about- - Your theory. Your experiment, yeah, I get it. Our experiment. I understand. Oh, god. Okay, you said be honest, and I am. I'm sorry if this messes up your boneheaded plan of yours. I thought you were gonna be honest about leaving me outside while you watch my favorite movie! I'm sorry. I didn't have anything to do with that, okay? That was all Erika's idea. I was gonna tell you - right after- - Yeah, right. I'm serious, okay? I literally just- - Wanted to gain back control of the relationship. Yeah, I know. I have no reason to lie to you. And even if I did, I'm sure it was a part of your stupid list. [somber piano music] It's all an experiment, remember? [Adam] Trying to watch TV here. I'm such a foolish dreamer. This whole marriage thing was stupid. Honey, you were just following your heart. You didn't do this to marry him. You did it to divorce us. If you get divorced, you're not moving back in here. Why is he always so mean to me? Because he really loves you, okay? Don't take this out on him. What, you thought you were gonna live it up in a fake marriage, huh? And then you end up falling in real love. I do love him. Well, somewhat. [somber music] Then love him, Tara, hmm? What's the worst that can happen? Your marriage ends, he throws you out on the street with no money, and you wind up living under a bridge. Any place but here. [Trijah whining] Father. Maybe if you put on more clothes you could keep a man. [light music] I don't know what to say. I can't fall in love. It'll ruin everything. Dude, you're already in love. I'm not. That explains a lot. Hey, you know, don't feel so bad. [sighing] I left Erika. You what? Well, kinda. She put me out for telling you about the whole ticket thing. Sorry, dude. Ah, probably for the better, right? Thanks a lot. Not for you, for me. If we stay married, then all of this would have been for nothing. It won't work and it won't support the theory. We have a mission and a goal. Your mission will be complete in about three weeks. What then? [treadmill squeaking] [somber music] So, in conclusion, I need everyone out there to be a KING team player! That is all. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Stop. Close the door. I don't know you, but you sure look like this All-Star slugger that used to work here. I'm back, sir, and ready to work. Swing and a miss. Go straight to the unemployment dugout. You're firing me? Yes, for not being a dedicated KING team player. There is no I in king. I've worked 70 hours a week for six years for this company! I'm the strongest salesperson you got! That was last season! What have you done for me lately? Nothing! 'Cause my marriage is falling apart. That fake marriage is taking your focus off the box score, ace. Box score? The cash, the moolah, the green. You need to focus your priorities, ace. You're absolutely right. I am? Mhmm. I quit! You can't quit, I fired you first! Three strikes and you're out! I'm red-flagging you! That's soccer, not baseball! Get your sports and your branding straight! Oh, and there is an I in KING! You wrote it! You're outta here! Going, going, going, gone! [Hanji sighing] Hey, sorry I'm late. Trying to get Mr. Weaver to stop harassing his ex. What's wrong? She left me. Thought it was supposed to last a year. I can't even last in a fake marriage. How can I ever last in a real one? Not like this. It's just an option, Mark. [doorbell dinging] Mmm, you must be Mark. Yes. I'm Kyrah, your mother-in-law. Oh, come in, come. Hmm, hmm. Hey, take your shoes off. You know how to marry my daughter but you don't know to take off your shoes. [Mark] I'm sorry. [Kyrah] That's Adam. Don't want to meet him. Very well. Do you need any help, sir? - Yes. - No. Mom, this pin just will not... What are you doing here? Hi. Tri, I just wanna talk! - Go do something. - You see? - You see? - You go do something. - You brought him. You go save her. [Trijah] What do you want, huh? For our families to come together? Spend Christmas with my wife? We don't celebrate Christmas. They're decorating a Christmas tree. They do that for the neighbors. And I'm not your wife anyway. You are. At least until the year is up. You're suing me? A deal's a deal. You're a real piece of work, you know that? You know what, you're right. A deal's a deal. I'll see it through till the end of the year. But not for you. For myself. Oh. And I really hope your second marriage is just as bad as the first one. Well, Tri. This meal was off the chizzle, my- - Dad. I think someone spiked that eggnog. They spike their own eggnog, dear. Next year, we do this all again at our place. Mm-mm, mm-mm. There won't be a next year, this is it. The last supper. The end. Who gets married for one year on purpose? Millennials. [Eileen] Ricky did. Marriage is a covenant with God and you mocketh him. Like father, like son. Do you want me to help you with the dishes before I go? Oh, no thank you. It all belongs to Mark anyway, I'm sure he'll be okay. Just drive safe, okay? Well, that went exactly as I thought it would. Yeah. Thanks for doing this.

Is that what you want? I mean, life is short. You gotta live each day as though it's your [Both] Last. Yeah, I know. I want a great marriage. Am I asking for too much? Marriage takes a lot of work and sacrifice. I mean, happily ever after doesn't just happen. You gotta decide and commit. You gotta make happily ever after happen. I just want what you and mom had. Yeah. About that. Your mom made me promise never to tell you about this, but, about three months before we found out about her heart condition, we had separated. She wanted a divorce. What? [sighing] When I found out about her heart, we agreed to stay together until... And she did it for you. And for me. Why didn't you tell me this before? 'Cause we wanted you to believe in love. Now you're about to do the exact opposite by leaving a woman who makes you truly happy because of some stupid theory you had. I don't know anyone that is happily married. What's the point if it just ends in divorce anyway? I mean, love. Man, it's worth it all, I mean even the losses. Trust me, I know. Spoken by a man who has been married six times. Thanks for lying to me my entire life, Rick. I gotta go, Mark's here. Love you too. Mom said hi. Well, I guess this is the end. Look. I wanna apologize for taking it so far. Oh, no. I'm sorry for even coming up with this, well, I didn't come up with it but, I'm sorry for getting you involved in this stupid idea. I mean I still think it's a good idea. Nah. Your dad, he was right. Marriage is sacred. A covenant with God and I should have never tampered with it. I mean, you had good intentions, right? It's all that counts. I'm the one who got caught up. You know, ever since I was little I dreamed of getting proposed to and getting married, and... I don't know, when we got married... sorry, when the experiment started, I stopped dreaming. I don't know, like, I guess I wanted it so bad. I wanted to make the trial run my final analysis. It doesn't have to end. What? Sure, we reached out goal, but, we can keep it going. We can add stuff to the list. We can take stuff off the list. We can extend the contract. We can do whatever we want! What do you say? I think we should stick to the agreement. A deal's a deal, right? [somber piano music] Do you think Mark's really gonna get a divorce? Do what? I don't know. I mean he seems like he really loves her, - or he might. - He does. It's final tomorrow anyhow though, so. Why are you acting like it's not a big deal? Hey, hey, hey Mark, it's good to see you. - Just a minute. - Mhmm. Hey, you don't have to do that. [birds chirping] [kooky music] Vicky's engaged to a worm farmer. I'm sorry. A worm farmer? [panting] Man, this better be good, dude. Vicky's engaged to a worm farmer. I thought we'd get back together. You sign the papers? As of tomorrow, I am officially divorced. Now, everything I worked for belongs to the worm farmer. Hey, man, don't feel so bad. At least you're not married to [whooshing] Erika Vader. I think I'm gonna get her a wedding gift. A toast. If it was meant to be, it'll be. Erika wants a divorce too. Oh, no. All because of me? No, man. Says I'm not man enough for her. Oh. At least we'll have each other. [All] The three divorciados. What are you gonna do now? About? Tri. What can I do? You can go get her. Look man, you love that girl. And he loves you. And you don't let some stupid experiment keep you from the love of your life. Go get her. It's over. It was just an experiment. No, no, it's not over until one of you dies. Look man, all I know is that you have a chance for real love. Don't let that pass you by, like we did. Man, I've known you your whole life. And I've never seen you this happy before. Keep experimenting with her, bro. Experimenting. [laughing] You have him? Yeah, go. [excited music] Hey, if it doesn't work out with Erika, I can hook you up with my cousin. Man, your cousin is ugly, dude. Like for real. Tri. You seen Tri? It's a little too late for that, Mr. A Deal's A Deal. She quit yesterday. You know where I can find her? I don't know. Probably somewhere feeding squirrels. [bright excited music] [door knocking] Hold your horses, Ben Hur. Jeez. You. Is she here? Please. I need to talk to her. She's not here. She went to live with her sister in Kansas. Bus leaves in 10 minutes. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Thank you, thank you. [somber music] Tri? I have been looking all over for you. What are you doing here? This is the first place you called me your wife. I'm a fool, okay? I have been miserable without you. I keep thinking about what great times we've had, and what great times we could lose. I don't want any could have moments. I would give everything to extend our one year into a lifetime. I was so focused on preparing for the right marriage, I didn't realize I had it. Tri. Will you marry me? Again? Please? You don't get it, do you? I don't want a second marriage with you. I want to keep the first. [music swelling] I wanna see you do your shower dance anyway. Mark, Trijah. By the way, it's Try-jah. [Crowd] Aaah. I now really pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss your bride. [crowd applauding] [kooky music] Congratulations, Mark. Thank you, Eileen.
