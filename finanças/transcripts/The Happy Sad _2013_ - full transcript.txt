* Oh, Darling Will you marry me? * I'll love you Till my dying day * Oh, Darling Will you marry me? * I'll love you Till I die, baby * Mmm. Where you going? Work. Sunday brunch. I'm already late. Neil's going to kill me. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, last night was fun. You're not feeling weird about... No. No, he was hot, right? Very. But not as hot as you. Meet me at the cafe. I'll be done at six. * We'll go on down To London town * Or maybe even Rome * No, we'll never know * A place called home * Until we're old and grown Hello. How's your day? Good. Good. Yeah. Um... Okay, so I want to talk to you... Wait, before you say anything... I saw you looking at it last time you were over. It's the artwork I did for the florists. I thought that print would, you know, look good in your bedroom. That's really sweet. Thank you. You're very welcome. Um... Okay, I... I wanna take a break. What? Yeah, just... Just a break for a little while. We're not breaking up. I... Why? I mean, I just need some time to just figure things out. For myself. And so I think we should take a break. What's going on? Nothing's going on. I... I just... It has nothing to do with you. Neil, I'm sorry. The subway was crazy but I'm here now. It's brunch, Aaron. Are you crazy? I know, I know. Look, I'll take one of your shifts next week. Table four, okay? Okay, thank you. Thank you! You seem angry. Are you angry? I'm not angry, Annie. I'm hurt. 'Cause I love you. Is there someone else? No. We always said we'd be honest with each other. I know. That's why I'm here. So we can talk. These six months have been great. I know they have. That's why I don't understand. How you guys doing? I'm Aaron, I'm gonna be your server today. Thank you. You guys have any questions? We need more time. I'll be right back. Is there someone else? It isn't serious. It's... What's his name? It doesn't matter. Just tell me his name. Mandy. "Mandy?" Yeah. You're seeing Mandy? Uh... Mandy is nice. Mandy is great. Wait, you never mentioned before that you... Well, that's because it's a recent development. Me and Mandy is... Have you ever had feelings? You know, feelings for... women? Well, yeah. Yeah. Um... She's just... It's different. Yeah, I have. I just... I need some time to figure things out, that's all. Please don't be upset. Okay? Are you... You guys ready? I can't see you anymore. Stan... * Oh, Darling Will you marry me? * I'll love you Till my dying day * Oh, Darling Will you marry me? * I'll love you Till I die, baby * How'd your skaterboy thing go? Oh, disastrous. I mean, he was so immature. I met him. He seemed really sweet. He was really young and he didn't have his shit together. Hold on, he was like 23. Yeah. Yeah, so am I. And he didn't understand that I had auditions. Yes, but I'm sorry. You don't give yourself an opportunity to be in a relationship. I give a lot of opportunity. No, you don't. Yes, I... How much money did you make? Uh, 240. You did not. Yeah, it's brunch. Ah, it's because you're flirty and you put your hands on their... Whoa, whoa, whoa. vile customers' shoulders. No, I do not. That's true. Whatever. 240? You didn't even... You're buying drinks on Wednesday, period. See you later. Tell Marcus I said "Hi." Yeah. AARON: I feel really bad for him. Well, here's the thing, though. He doesn't make himself available. So it's not like he's gonna find someone. Wait, wait, wait. What about that skinny, white skater boy? Which one? That's true. Goes through 'em like left and right, man. And never settles down with any of them. He just wants to take him out for a spin on... the Neil train. The Neil train. Oh. I smell like hash browns. Mmm. I woke up the other day before the alarm went off. Just sitting there, watching you. Really? Yeah. Your head on that pillow. Looked like a little nut. Yeah. Aww. Like a big ol' almond or something. I just wanted to take my jaw... unhinge it... Mmm-hmm. and swallow your head whole. You know, there's no distance between us. I love you. I love you. Last night was fun. Yeah? It was hot to see you with him. Really? Working your thing, yeah. You serious? Yeah. I was thinking, do you... Do you maybe wanna like try an open relationship? We could try. Yeah? Maybe. Maybe? You know. But we need some rules. We definitely need rules. Yeah. What if... Okay, no repeats. We only have fun with a guy once and we always, always tell each other. Come on. Let's not make rules we know we're gonna break. Please don't ever lie to me, Marcus. I can't promise that. Neither can you. Well, I've never lied to you. Oh, really? Yeah. What about whatshisname? No, don't even bring him up. I was working on play, playing his boyfriend. I got confused, all right? And P.S.that was once in six years, so... Fair enough. Okay, well, what about our place, like, are we allowed to have people over, or we... All right, listen. The rules. We don't fall in love. That's it, that's the rule. * A million dark nights * You feel that you have No hope * So in the 60s, they talked a lot about changing the world, and ending the war, the truth is, kids, they didn't really do much except take a lot of drugs and get herpes. Okay, uh, sorry. Teacher's feeling a little out today. Let's just open the textbooks to... Um, okay, don't forget, your Watergate assignment is due tomorrow. You can put anything you want in them, but make them about Nixon. Oh, shit. Hey, Mandy. Hey. Do you ever look at internet porn? Yeah, everybody does. I guess cause things are over with Stan. Yeah, I still don't understand why. He's 20, he's in a band. Uh, so? Last night, I looked at this site for two hours. Just all these pictures of stuff. I think it's done something to my brain. Huh? Like, when I woke up this morning I somehow felt like my brain was somehow different. You know, because of the porn, like it changed the chemistry of my brain. I don't think porn changes your brain. What would you like to look at? I mean, when you look. Oh, um... I'm on Zoloft. Huh? So I'm not much in the mood for... Oh. all of that... Oof, bummer. You want to hang out after work? Yeah. Cool. Yeah. No kissing. Okay. I don't know. There's no way it can work, right? I mean, he's... He's in a band. Are you trying to convince me or you? Wait, you think that... Well, I don't know. What about the guy before, Patrick? I mean, how long were you guys dating before you... No, about six months, but I mean, it's not a pattern, okay? I just... I need to find somebody that's stable. Stan isn't? I mean, I don't know. I guess he kind of is. I mean, he's definitely always there. I don't know, Mandy. Come on, I mean, like, he's 20 years old. And you know, he's like a struggling musician. You know, like I'm enough of a mess as it is. I don't need, like, more mess in my life. Uh, when Stan and I had our talk I, uh, I told him I was seeing you. Wait, what? Yeah. I don't know. He was convinced that there was someone else. And he kept asking, "What's his name?" So finally I was like, "Mandy". Wait, why did you tell Stan that you were seeing me? I don't know, it just came out. It seemed easier, you know. It was him that I was leaving, I was changing lifestyles. Have you ever been with a woman before? No. Have you? Not since college. Mandy, you did? I went to Vassar. Did you like it? I did. It was fun. She was very forceful. Mmm-hmm. Surprising. She had this... What? It was fun. Did you ever think about becoming one full time? Although the sex was fun, but at the time I wasn't interested, and everything that went along with it, but now... Maybe. Thanks. No, thank you. Are those my, uh... Sorry. Sorry. Here. So obviously, this was your first time. Yeah. You're very good. Thanks. You're very cute. You, too. Want to hang out again? Sometime, maybe tomorrow or... I don't know. Ah, sorry. You have a girlfriend? No. I mean, we... broke up. Well, I'm honored to be your first. You really think I was good? Yes, Tom. Listen, my name isn't Tom. It's not Tom. It's Stan. Stan. I'd love to do this again. I'll leave it up to you. You know, just email me or... Okay. Marcus. Would you, uh... Would you hold me? Yeah. Hey, Mandy, it's Annie. I'm just calling to say hi. It was fun hanging out today. Anyways, no need to call me back. Or... Yeah. Okay, so I'll... I'll see you at school. Bye. We should move to Middle America. Raise a bunch of adopted kids from the Phillipines. Are you drunk? No, I'm serious. Okay. How many? Mmm. Probably no more than five. That would be really nice. Mmm Yeah. Kids, backyard, fence. Dogs, cat. Kitchen table, dishwasher. Maybe a garbage disposal unit. A llama. You're crazy. So have... Have you... Have you, you know... Taken advantage of our new situation yet? Why do you ask? No reason. Well, have you? Maybe. "Maybe"? Well, I don't know. Yeah, well, I do. You left the sex towels in the hamper for me to wash. I'm sorry. Shit! Not a big deal. No. I thought he was stupid. And? Yeah. I guess so. So have you... fooled around? No. * Thousand rainy days * You worry He'll be gone * Gone, gone... What? It's nothing. It's just, on your demo It's "She'll". * You worry she'll be gone Okay. Okay. Why don't we just do it again? * Thousand rainy days * You worry She'll be gone * Hey. Hi. I'm sorry I didn't call you back last night. Oh, don't be silly. I was at the hospital late. The hospital? My dad. It's nothing. Well, is he all right? Um... He had an infection and it spread into his arms. But... Yeah, it's fine. He'll be fine. Okay, well, if you ever need to talk... Yeah, thank you. I don't know. I know that it's Friday but maybe tonight? Yeah! Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Oh, wait. Shit. Blind date. Ah. I'll cancel though. No, no, no, no, no. Don't be silly. E He's a stand-up comic. He sounds normal. I don't think stand-up comics are normal. Yeah, you're right. Well, we'll see. It'll be funny. I hope. What if he's awful? He's probably actually not gonna be funny at all. That's cool. I know lots of couple who do that. Oh, yeah. You two been together how long? Six years. So does he play? I know you do. I think he lied. What? I asked him last night. He lied. Maybe he hasn't. Not everyone is a slut bucket like you. And you, okay? True. The other night, I... kinda read his emails. Oh, shit. You've gotta trust him. But I saw the email, and it said from curiousmusician82 meeting at our place. Who does he go to bed with every night, huh? Who's he spent the last five years with? Oh, shit. Wretchd indie-rock girl wants another refill. Go for it. How you doing, Miss K? Hey, Jamal, how are you? All right. Where's my fucking phone? Oh, I'm sorry, Jamal that I used that word. Your phone is right there. What? Your phone is right there. Hello? Hello, Mom? What's going on? Calm down. I can't hear you. Mom? Fuck! Shit! Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Mandy. Annie. Mandy? I'm gonna let you two talk. Is everything okay? It's my dad. What happened? Um, they're gonna amputate both of his arms. They tried everything. It was the only way that they can stop the infection from spreading. Oh, my God. He told me a turkey joke. A what? A joke about... About a turkey my mom handed... Okay. Okay, Mandy, we'll get somebody to cover for you, okay? You should get to the hospital. Okay. Oh, wait, actually, before you go, maybe... Maybe we should say a prayer to God or... I don't know any prayers. Me neither, but I'm pretty sure you just talk to him. I don't know, I guess you... Okay. Yeah. Oh, I just... All right, I'm sorry. I just don't think I can do this right now. No, of course. I just thought... I don't know, I thought maybe it would... ...help. Can I kiss you? Yeah. It's getting late, man, and my partner will be home soon. Okay. Sorry, I just... No, I'm sorry. I thought he knew that you were... Yeah, but... Right. Yeah, I'll go. Stan. Oh. Oh, sorry. I'm interupting. Yeah, this is my partner, Aaron. I served you at the cafe last week. I thought that girl you were with was... I'm really sorry. I'm just gonna get going. No, no, no. Stay. Stay. Look, I just got some pot on my way home. We could smoke up, you know. Order some takeout. We could watch a game. Right? There's the game, right? There's gotta be a game on. We have DVDs if... You know what? Let's just listen to some music. Um, Stan, stay. Marcus, tell him. It'll be fun. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Okay. Okay! Okay. Okay, cool. Okay. I'll, um... I'll just put this in the fridge and I'll get the takeout menus. Cool. Cool. You okay? Yeah. Where'd he go? I need something. Something that's mine sometimes. I'm yours. That's now what I mean. You don't love me anymore? Oh, stop it. Sorry. Let's watch a movie. Sean Penn as Harvey Milk and Mystic Riv mash-up. I know you're angry. Is that my daughter in there? Life in New York just... It gets you down sometimes. I find that it's just tough. And it's like the little things, you know, it's like... Diners are weird. There's never enough napkins, And those really thin napkins that come out of those dispensers? And you always have to... I always use 50 of them. And it's like, "Just make... Just make... Just make one napkin that's thicker. It would save you money and it would save me time." And those half and half containers? You know? Man! I think open-heart surgery would be easier first thing in the morning. Try to open those things. What did you think? Your act is kind of like observations. Yeah. Yeah. You know, about life. Mundane shit, but with a twist. But you know, they do make easy-to-open half and half containers with the screw-top. So... You didn't think it was funny. Oh, no, David. No, it was very funny. I mean... The way you deliver it, it's full of irony. Yeah. But you know what's actually really funny? Mmm. Is when you... When you like implicate the audience. You know? Implicate? Yeah, like, um... Instead of talking about everyday stuff, what if you talk about... I don't know, Darfur. I don't know anything about Darfur. Exactly. Exactly, that's the point. You're holding up a mirror to the audience. So you're pointing out the fact that there's this horrible genocide going on and no-one knows anything about it. Now that's funny. Uh, I want people to laugh. Darfur isn't funny. It's like a tragedy. No, I know. I know. But comedy comes from tragedy. So... Yum, this pirogi is really good. WOMAN: What sort of therapy or counseling did you get? MAN: Well, this repairative therapy comes in a number of flavors. I attended two types of conversion therapy sessions. One was free. It was held on the basement of a Christian church with a lot of praying. Hi. Hey, hi! Listen, I'm sorry. No, come in. I don't want to bother you. Bother me, please. I'm eating froyo and watching TiVo of Rachel Maddow. It's fine. Oh, how are you? How's your dad? Uh, my dad. Uh... Shit. I don't know. He's, um... He's alive, right? I mean, he doesn't have any arms. But he's alive. So the doctor says that he is recovering. But my mom, she is... I don't know, I think it's the stress. We're in the waiting room and she started singing. Singing? Yeah, like, uh... * Life changes Love lasts forever * Happy 33rd birthday, son What song is that? I don't know. I think it's like a message from a greeting card. My mom, she just sings messages from greeting cards now. Yikes. Yeah. I know. My brother took her home so she'd get some sleep. But I just... I couldn't go home right now. No, no, stay. Do you want some of this? It's actually really good. Oh. I'm sorry. I just... I'm sorry. Oh, my God! * I'm seeing things That aren't real * There's no water in the pool * But I am still swimming * I'm hearing sounds That aren't here * There's a voice downstairs * And I am still lonely * I'm feeling I've fallen asleep * Awake in a dream * But I am still searching I don't even see where it is. How could I not know he was gonna be a freak? That's like, seriously. Darfur? That was really harsh. He wasn't funny. Ugh, worst date ever. I mean... Hey, I'm hungry. Yeah, me too. This was a nice surprise. How are you? Are you feeling okay? I mean, after... Yeah, okay. I'm better than okay. Hey, I have an idea. Let's go into Manhattan and do something. Like museum or a movie. I have to go to the hospital. You should take the day off. You're so stressed. You brother can handle things for the day. You're a bad influence. You have a little... Here, I got that. I made it worse. Okay. Thanks. You're welcome. That is yummy. That train is taking forever. Oh, I'm sorry. Is that... It's new. You like? Mandy, are... Are we... I just... I didn't think it was more than... Oh, I'm sorry. We can take that one, right? Oh, shit. This train's stopping. We've to wait for the F. ANNOUNCER: This is the last stop on this train. Everyone please leave the train. Thank you for riding with FTA New York City Trains. Hi. Hey, Annie. How are ya? I'm good. Uh... You remember... Hi. Mandy. Mandy, right. Hi. Hi. It's great to see you again. It's good to see you, too. I'm sorry. Excuse me. So I know it's none of my business, but are you two still, uh... Well, you're right. It's none of your business. Sorry. I mean, it's not like a big deal. Very cool. She's... Very pretty. I'm sorry. I thought that day... Hey, Annie. Um, Annie. I'm just gonna go down, it's my brother. Oh, hey, yeah. No rush, I'll wait. You thought what? I just thought you were lying. That day at the cafe. We're... We're not together. Hey. Hey, you remember me? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, I got you this. No, I don't understand. Mom's in the hospital? What... What happened, Evan? Is mom all right? Stan you need to talk to these guys. No, no, no, Annie. It's fine. Don't go. Wait a minute. You were our waiter at the cafe, right? Yeah, right. And it's funny. Marcus here is a client of mine. Yeah, right. We should be at the back of the car for this. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We'll see you guys later. See you soon. Bye. Hey. Everything okay? Any news? * Today is the first day * For all mankind * And step-dad May there be no limit To the happiness you find * Wanna wish you Happy Kwanzaa * Happy Kwanzaa What's happening? Are you all right? Is everything okay? Mandy, are you... What are you doing? Why is everybody looking at me? Okay, just take it easy, all right? I'll be OK. I'm just... I'm just gonna go. Wait, Mandy. No. Let me walk you. No, don't be silly. I'm just fine. I'll walk you home. No. No, Annie. It's okay, okay? I'm okay. I'm... I'm sorry, Stan. That' fine. I have no idea what just happened. Do... I... Stan, I gotta... Go, go. Okay. You're gorgeous, you know that? Stop. It's true. I missed you. You missed me? You just spent the last four nights here. Too much? No. Sorry I was so stupid. Not as stupid as me. You see it? This patch of red on your inner thigh? Yeah. Before we continue, tell me, Aaron, how many new partners in the past six months? You're not playing Doctor. Surely someone as handsome, and endowed as you... Marcus, please. I'm on my knees, and look, no response. It might be herpes. It was that NYU kid. Fungus. Fungus? Shit! Stop. Where you going? You got jock itch. What? Fungus, aka the jock itch. Ew! Um, you left your laptop on last night. What? Sorry. That's... That's not cool. I, uh, I saw some of the sites that you go to. It's for work. It's porn, Stan. So I look at porn sometimes. Well, I like gay porn, too. And you have a profile on that site "Manhunters" or something, and it's... It's you, I mean, it's a picture of your... Annie! Annie, you have no right! Okay, okay. Listen, you're right. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for snooping. It isn't cool. But I want you to know I think it's... It's cool. I mean, it's sexy you're exploring. I haven't since we've gotten back together. Oh, so... You fooled around with a guy? Oh. Oh, it's one of those guys from the subway the other day, wasn't it? I can't have this conversation. Stan. Look, Aaron, you don't have herpes with the clap. You got jock itch. You need to go to Walgreens and get some medicine. Might even have some in the medicine chest. Don't look like that. Means you're a jock. Mmm? You should be happy. Jock. You don't get it. I've been freaking out all week. I live here, too, remember? I went online and saw these pictures of... Last week it was oral gonorrhea. You wanna tell me what this is really all about. What would you do if I was positive? Are you positive? No. No. What is this, let's play "I have HIV?" No... Just tell me. What would you do? First I'd kiss you. Then I might cry. We'd look at each other for a long, long time. Then I'd kiss you again. Kiss you some more. Then I'd undo your pants... Take 'em down real slow. Then your briefs. And I'd suck your cock. Take you to the bedroom, and we'd have very hot, very safe sex. And I'd hold you tight. Then I'd leave you. People have all have needs, eventually. And I just... I don't want to be one of those women, you know? One of those women that's like "Oh, he did what? I had no idea men did stuff like that because I am a complete moron." I don't wanna be that woman. I just... I wanna be smart about the way things are with sex and needs. I mean, look at our parents. My parents are divorced. Exactly. Dad boned his assistant, Mom blew the plumber, and everybody's gotta suffer. It's the same god damn story every time. But we can be different. You know? Try something new. Open things up, like an arrangement. Like if I found a man attractive and you did, too, then... No, we could. Or maybe a woman. I can't talk about this right now. Stan, you're, um... You're hard. I've been reading the emails you write to Stan. Oh, I get it now. So you... read my emails, then you go screw some NYU boy. No. No, it is not like that. Why do you do this? Do you have feelings for him? No. Tell me. I mean, is that why you didn't want me here the night that I walked in on you two? Tell me. Here's the deal. If we do this, we do it together. Okay? If we wanna explore our bi side... I'm not bi. Curious, whatever you wanna call it. We do it, we do it together. And it's only about sex. I'm ashamed. You in a church? No. Then can the shame shit. I don't know, between men and women there's just usually all of this, like... This grrrr, you know? It's never equal. It's just always all this ick. But with you, there's not. It's like your my boyfriend and my gay best friend all rolled in one. I'm not gay! I'm not... Give me your hand. See? I like this. We don't do it often? No, and we can talk about it. Like, tell me about... about your time with Marcus. What? That's his name, right? Readyforever25, Marcus? Yeah. Yeah. He what? Yeah. He fucked... You fucked him? He fucked me. Oh, I... I just assumed that you, uh... Oh. Do you want me to go? What are you doing on my phone? What are you doing answering mine? Well, this is gay. You're in the other room. We've got unlimited minutes. Listen... The other night I couldn't sleep. I looked over at you. You were so silent, and I thought, "What if... I'm scared, Aaron, one day I'll come home and you won't be here?" Crane accident, brain tumor, stray bullet, dirty bomb, cancer. The hole you'll leave behind, I'll never fill. It's been six years. I'm forgetting life before. How could I live without you? I'll live till I'm 1000 years old and never leave you. I feel something for him. I don't know what. I'm confused. I won't call him again. Hey. We don't have any stuff here for your fungus. Better go to the corner drugstore before they close. Yeah. Yeah, cool. Great. Look for Tinactin. Tough acting...? What? Aaron. Yeah? Hurry back. Hi. Hey. Missed you at school. I took some time off because... Right. How are things? Not good. You never returned my calls. You called once. Things got busy. Stan? Yeah. Yeah, we're back together. Things got confusing. I...didn't mean to hurt you. There are consequences, Annie. I was hurting, and that night... Never mind. I'm sorry. He died, Annie. My dad, and I never went to see him. I didn't go and see him. I'm a fucking horrible person. No, you're not. And after my mom went nuts, after you, it's just so much. It's just too much. You should go. But Mandy, I... I will be at school in a few weeks. Okay. You should go on YouTube and check out the David guy you went on a blind date with. The comic? Seems you left quite an impression. Hey. Are you okay? Hey... Slow down, Speedracer. I don't have a lot of time. How are things? With Annie. Can we not talk about that? Sure. Bedroom? Maybe we should hang out sometime. We're hanging out now. Uh, I don't know, coffee. See a band. Maybe. It's gonna be my birthday in a week. Happy birthday. Turning 26, right? Your Manhunt profile... I'm gonna be 30. Okay. Cool. You ever wonder what it'd be like if we all live to be a thousand years old? Like, if there was no death. Then we could all get happy. Or maybe not. We don't have 1000 years, do we? Should we take a chance? Marcus, what's going on? I love you. Uh... No, you don't. I think about you all the time. I have a girlfriend. I love Annie. And you've said you were just looking... I know what I feel. I... I came here to get off. You feel something, too. I know. I'm gonna get going. Stan, I know you're confused. Confused? You don't know anything about me. You're the confused one, fucking bringing me here, you say shit like that. "You love me?" What is that? We hooked up a few times. That was it. Don't call me again. Stan, wait... Shit! Sorry, I had this taste in my mouth. You know, they say you shouldn't swim on an empty stomach. See, comedy comes from tragedy, motherfucker. You guys like Darfur? You guys said you wanted dark. MAN: You suck! You suck! You think I'm a mess? I'll show you, Annie. Annie! Oh! Oh, my God. MAN: Is that guy dead? WOMAN: Who's Annie? Shit. What happened? Did you get mugged? I don't wanna talk about it. Did you call the cops? I mean, are there any witnesses? It's taken care of. Did you call the cops or not? No. Oh, God, I'm gonna call them. I wasn't mugged. Then what happened? I'm gonna move out. Aaron. Just need some space to figure this all out. Aaron, please. You lied to me. For weeks, about him. Then you tell me you love him. I didn't mean for it to happen. I'll start looking tomorrow. Aaron... No, just... I want to be alone. I don't know, he's just... He's knda quiet, but I feel like he's really taking everything in. You know, like he hears me. I don't know. And he's my best student. Here. How is it I mean, I don't mean temperature. Bit spicy, is it? I tried not to make it so spicy this time. It's good. We could have gone out, you know. But I love cooking. I mean, I know I'm not that good at it, but I should do more of it. Cooking, cleaning. I don't know, that's what people do, right? Anyway, there's more rice in the kitchen if you want it. I'm fine. Hey, look at me. Are you okay? Yeah, I told you I'm fine. Okay. I just... I tried calling you earlier, and you weren't there. Were you working at home, or... What's with the third degree? Sorry, I just... I though you had a big design project. What are you wearing? What? Christ, you're not 18 anymore. Okay, Stan, you're hurting my feelings. You're not acting like yourself. Did something happen today? No. We said we'd be honest. It's nothing. Did you meet a guy today? I mean, online, is that what happened? Is that why you didn't answer your phone? Was it that guy, Marcus? You're reading my fucking emails again? No, Stan, but I know you, and we said we'd be honest. We said we wouldn't do anything without talking about it. I'm going. Just tell me what happened. Hey, do you know when Miss K's coming back? Jamal, Miss K will be back very soon. Okay. Did you...? Yeah. Sublet. Are we gonna talk about this? We talked. And I said I just need some time. I apologized. Can we not do this? Sorry. I don't understand. Are we breaking up? I don't know. I just need some time to figure things out. Well, figure 'em out with me. We've been through this. Okay. Look, I, um... I invited Alice and her girlfriend. I think it's her girlfriend, over for dinner. I asked Neil from work, too. I already invited them here for your birthday. I thought since it was my birthday... You should come. Yeah. Maybe, I've got to take care of some things. Okay. Another round. Hey. You're... Yeah. Join me. How's it going? Long day. Yeah. Yeah. I hear ya. This is on the house, guys. How can people have it all figured out? I don't know. I'm not one of those people. I hate those people who know what they want. Cheers to that. I mean, I have no idea what I want. And everything I touch turns to shit. See, I'm worried, like It's not that I don't know what I want, but that I actually do know, but I'm scared to go for it. Well, it seems like you went for it with Stan. I think he made it clear he's not interested. Why didn't he just tell me? He was scared. I mean, shit, if Mandy wanted to fuck me again, I would do it. Doesn't mean I don't love Stan. Just having my fingers inside of her... I don't know. That's a lot of information. How about that whisky? You guys want another one? Yes, please! Do you think he's gay? Be honest. A part of what makes him so attractive to... Wait, wait, can I say this? I just told you I fingered Mandy. Say it. He's such an open guy. Trusting. I never felt like it was about me being a guy. It was amazing. What was I thinking? Stan told me you suggested the whole arrangement. I did, but I mean, think about it. At some point I'm gonna have to get married and have a kid. Or cook. Or something. I mean, don't I want that? Do you want that? No. Then don't do it. Easy for you to say, homo. Straight people have it tough. All that fucking pressure to conform. That's why you all hate us. Jealous. You got it all figure out? I broke all our rules. And we didn't have many. Now he's moving out. You gonna let him go? I want things back the way they were. But you can't. So it's either a life with him, with all its complications and flaws, or life without. Shit. Let's drink. I'm gonna be a mess. That'll put hair on your chin. Just what I need. I totally... I deep-throated that ketchup bottle for like five minutes. The teacher's were stunned. It was... Oh, my God. It was our senior acting project and he gives head to a Heinz bottle. What grade did you get? Uh, I think I got an A. Nice. You did not! Do you remember... "The Red Room"? Yes, it was about a squirrel who built a nest in my vagina. Oh, my God, yes, it was hilarious! And... And what, we did... We did that thing together where I had the little elf who lived off Hi Tek. Yes, and he looked like Michael Landon. Yes! Michael Landon? Yeah. Oh, Michael Landon! Can you believe I was into Michael Landon? You were into Michael Landon? I was! Wow. I think that was my last boy crush. Hmm. Let me clear this. It was delicious. Should I help you? Sure. I like her. Yes? Yes. She's great. How did you meet her? You really wanna know? Yeah. It's kinda gay. Sauna, steam room, gym. Are you kidding me? That's nice. It's kinda hot. It's not the first time I've gone trolling. Not mine either. She talked to me and she convinced me to go to my dad's funeral 'cause I wasn't gonna go, because my family is just ,like, a little insane. And I felt like, um, I have a lot of insanity already, and I didn't need to go to the funeral and absorb some more. But, um... I get it. But she was really nice and she came with me, and I wouldn't have been able to go if I wasn't with her. You went with her, actually? Yeah. I can't believe that. That was the exact day? That was... Okay, right, so this is like... I mean, she was just sitting there, catatonic, so... That's heavy, dude. I know. She must be in a really rough place. I can't believe she's... ...here. Yeah. I'm there for her. Yeah. I am sorry to hear about your dad. I told him jokes. I told... those headstone jokes. The jokes that I never told him before I died. He liked jokes. Tell me one. Okay. "Hey, Dad, give me five. Okay, I'll settle for a toe." He didn't have arms. They cut them off. Oh. Enough about me and Mandy. What about you? Me? Where's Marcus? You dodged the question all through dinner. Isn't it his birthday? Yeah. And don't get mad but I saw... the moving boxes in your bedroom. Hey, Marcus, Happy Birthday! Hi, Neil. Good to see you, man. Come, meet Mandy. Mandy? Yeah. Hi, Mandy. Hi. Welcome. Welcome. Howdy, stranger! Alice. Hey! Hi. Hey. Hey. Um, we just finished cleaning up, but there might be some leftovers. Oh, no, that's okay. I'm fine. Uh, all right, I'm gonna get something in the kitchen. I'll be right back. So Marcus, how's it going? Uh, pretty well, pretty well. New client. Ooh, exciting. Yeah. I wish I had a regular job. Somebody bring Marcus a glass! Oh, thanks. It's kinda boring, actually, but you know, you make do. I got to pay the bills somehow. Wanna talk? Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. He really hurt me, Alice. Six years. It's bound to happen. You think you can forgive him? And I went away for three weeks to do another play. But it's been amazing, and also like, it's scheduled so that if I have an audition in the afternoon I just work morning shifts. Oh, you do. Yay! Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Whoo! Yay! Hey. Hi. Before you say anything, just let me explain. I know it's late, and I know... I messed things up and I know you messed things up, too, but none of that matters, okay? Because I've been thinking, and I know there's no road map for this, but maybe there's a way that we can make things work. You know, your needs, my needs, we can, I know. I saw this special on couples out West... Out in Oregon or something. And there were three or four of them sharing. And yes, yes, they were fat and there was lots of facial hair going on. But we can forgo beards, right? Beards aren't a requirement. Maybe we could meet another couple? Like us, you know, somebody already in love and they could love us both, maybe. I don't know, but I'm willing to try whatever it takes. Because I wanna be with you. I love you, Stan. I don't love him. I love you. Let's make a wish. How about that, each of us, okay? * A million dark nights * Reveal that you have lost * Lost, lost Lost, lost * But then comes the sun * You feel you might have won * Come on, come on Come on, come on * Yeah * Let there be times * That's all there is * Dont' let there be times * That's all there is * Thousand rainy days * You worried He'll be gone * Long gone, long gone * Gone along * But then comes the sun My man * You feel you might have fun * Come on, come on Come on, come on * Yeah * Let there be times * That's all there is * Let there be time * That's all there is * A hundred dotted day You worry he'll be gone * Gone, gone, gone, gone Gone, gone * But then comes the sun * You feel you might have fun * Come on, come on Yeah, yeah, yeah * Let there be time * That's all there is * Let there be time * That's all there is Thank you.
