Nora after motives of Ibsen's play Nora, are you coming? Coming. But Nora, you call this 15 minutes? I've seen a lapwing and a redshank. They've come from Egypt. Do you realize how far away that is! What about us? And we've still a long way to go till we're home. Is my poor little Robert so hungry? The flood may be here in half an hour, and I've heaps of work to do. Forget about that tiresome work. It won't run away. But when one has such a nice wife ... one must see to it that she doesn't get wet feet. Now put on your hosepipes. But you'll give me a kiss for each boot. No. 1 With more feeling, if you please. Here you are. - No. 2. - Thank you, Mr. Solicitor. Now let's be quick. Where's your hat? Good gracious! Nora, you're always forgetting something. They've gone out, to the Birds' Island. - Robert talking a walk? - Indeed he is. - Bravo. I thought he'd lost the habit during these last months. But Doctor, you know Nora, when she sets her mind on something she'll talk us all round. You haven't visited us for some time. You see, now the flood has come. We'll get across. If Madame had hurried a bit more .... But it's been fun. What's the matter? Water running into my boot. When you have such a nice young wife you must carry her on your hands. Come here. My dear husband. My good husband. Why aren't you ever serious? How far it is. We'll manage till the pier. My poor husband. Are you cold? No, I feel as if I've been put on ice. I was in Berlin a few days ago. And you're only telling me now? Tell me, what did the gentlemen think of Robert's work? They praised it. That's nice. Then all his effort wasn't in vain. You don't know what it involved, besides his court work and in his office. The boy gave up all pleasures. He only worked, without taking care of himself or his health. He'll reward you for what you did for him. Doctor, that's nonsense. I'm his mother. But I understand that he wants, for his wife to have everything she gave up for him at the time. The old Röcklitz residence was magnificent. And everything revolved round his daughter. I remember it well. What a radiant spoilt child Nora was. She conquered all the hearts. My poor little Robert. - Don't bother. - No, you must take them off. What's taking him so long? He'll be here soon. He has a hard time with the boat. My Robert is all wet. That's right. Are you very cold? But heroes are never cold. Really Robert, you looked like a hero, brave and masculine. To die for. Alvine! You'd better throw down a pair of dry pants. Let me have them. There he comes! Well, thank you, Tönnesen. - The Director was in great danger. - It was nothing. - If you ever are in need of ... - With pleasure. Why don't you come with us, Tönnesen. Because I'm a bit afraid of Mama. - Come along. - Get up behind him. Good bye, Alvine. ??? have fun I'm a bit worried about Robert. It's good that you're here. I don't want to talk about it with Nora. I don't want to worry her. Why don't you examine Robert thoroughly? No, Frau Helmer. You know I've given up my medical practice. I prefer to occupy myself with the stars. They are of nobler matter than mankind. No, please leave it dark a bit longer. I find it easier to talk in the dark. When living with the stars, Madame, you keep excellent company. They set us free. They mislead us about our own mortality. You went to Berlin for treatment, didn't you? How do you mean? I see. Always the same trouble. The doctors don't know how to treat a protracted tropical fever. One must be patient. But it's not important. But of course it's important. Now I'll turn it on. One mustn't let oneself go, be tired or resigned. Do you imagine I could have supported Robert and myself, made him study law, if it hadn't been my firm resolution. Perhaps you don't know, Madame, what it is I want. Quick. Don't make a noise. Meanwhile I'll discreetly handle the matter downstairs. - Yes please. Another question, Frau Helmer. Good evening Doctor, here for another visit? Where can I find in your kitchen the ... cinnamon? Cinnamon? Why cinnamon? For the hot toddy for Herr Helmer. Is he back? Where is he? Where he is? Half an hour ago up to his neck in saltwater, and now hopefully in bed. One ... two ... What's going on here? Mama, Robert must change because it was a bit cold tonight, wasn't it, Robert ... - Do you know who's downstairs? - Who? - Dr. Rank. - Is he back from Berlin? - Did he say anything? Nora, you run along, I'll join you later. - Yes, do. Mama, did he say anything? Have the gentlemen read my work? Go on! Tell me. With pleasure. What shall I talk about? The weather? Fashions? But Doctor! You know perfectly well what I want to hear. Of course. I should have guessed at once. You won't believe me, Nora. - What? The ladies of Berlin wear their curls longer on the front. "Pony-curls" they call it. - Pony-curls? - And I admit it looks ... quite attractive. Doctor, it isn't nice to tantalize me so. But I know how to treat you, you disgusting egoistic bachelor So you like pony-curls? Like this? Or like this? Like this! And now talk! I can't. - Why not? - I've my mouth full. Doctor, I'll strangle you. - Then I must tell you. - Well? What did you say? No! Doctor, please don't joke now. It's true. Robert. I must tell Robert. Robert! Wait a second. Let him be tantalized too. Let him be tantalized too. I'm glad. He's coming. Don't tell him yet. Good evening, Doctor. Good evening. Mama just tells me that you put in a good word for me. - My sincere thanks. - My dear Helmer, don't mention it. Sit down. Well? The President of the Bank has read my work? He's read it. And liked it? Pardon? Yes, he liked it, absolutely. Really? Because I was hoping to have outlined new aspects for a future policy on foreign currency. You know how much this treatise means to me. I want to expand my field of activity. And this small solicitor's practice doesn't satisfy me on the long run. Certainly, I can see that. But in that direction, unfortunately, I can't confirm any definite results. Really? I can't stand it any longer. I can't stand it any longer. - What's the matter, Nora? You're a bank director, Robert. Bank Director. Really! Doctor, please ... - It's true. In Oldenfoerde. In Oldenfoerde? You're to start on October 1st. - That early? That's fine. What's the matter with him? Is he crying? Ladies and gentlemen, the hot toddy. Madame... The right moment. We must have a toast. - Why? Herr Helmer has become a bank director. What? Bank director? A genuine director? My congratulations. Come on, little Robert. Have a drink. Dear friends, dear Mama, and dear Nora, I'm so happy so very happy, that ... Robert? What's the matter? Too silly. I can't understand. I'd rather ... Don't let me disturb you. Come with me. Leave it to me. - Thank you, Nora. Forgive me. Tönnesen, you join them. What's happened, Doctor? He looked so strange. Is he ill? Well... It seems his involuntary sea-bathing and driving home in his wet clothes ... Dr. Rank! Coming. Well, old man. Don't overdo it now. Take it slowly. Three months illness are no trifle. Let's go out into the sun, my boy. I'm so happy that Robert is well again. Aren't you? Well, you don't say anything? I've spoken to the doctor, Nora. Robert is better, true, but he hasn't recovered yet. And he cannot recover at home. Why not? The illness is more persistent than we thought. But Doctor ... His life is still in danger. Are you coming, Nora? I will, Robert. His life is in danger? We must do something. Listen to me, I've a suggestion. Robert should leave for the South. The best would be a sea voyage. Once we've moved to Oldenfoerde, into the big house, you won't have to work again, you'll only take walks, receive visitors for tea, wear silk gowns ... Good God, you're frightening me. My esteemed father-in-law, Herr von Röckwitz, will be surprised. He used to call me a starveling beggar. And now bank director. Bank director, Mama. Come, Robert He should sit down a bit. My dear little Robert. How thin you've become. Like a little boy. You've been very kind to me during the last weeks, Nora. Like a real good wife. But that's what I am. You're my dear little Nora. How beautiful we're swinging. Like on a ship. Do you like a sea voyage? Robert, you must make a sea voyage. A trip to the South is the only way for Robert to get well again. But the costs ... I used to be the doctor for the Shipping Company and can obtain a discount. Only we must hurry. The ship departs in four days. Right now, Nora is trying to make Robert accept it. You must go South, where the lemons are in bloom and the palm trees are rustling. We're no millionaires, Nora. No, but Dr. Rank said, with a couple of 100 marks you can get around the whole word. And Papa has so often offered to ... No, Nora, I won't make any debts. You can't understand this. Robert, if you stay ill, you won't be any good at the bank. And you'll stay ill. Your life is in danger. Dr. Rank was very explicit. So, the ship departs at the end of the week. Dr. Rank will take you to Hamburg. I'll get the money and join you later. It's perfectly easy, isn't it? Robert? Do it for me. My little Robert. We're travelling? We're travelling! No! It's not possible! Quiet! My bag. Papush. Papa? Now he'll come. We'll surprise him. Balthazar. The Demoiselle. I'm Frau Helmer now, Balthazar, an old wife. Where's Papa? Your Papa, the Baron, is out hunting. - Really? Where? - In Wolzenburg. So far? But he'll be back tonight. - Are you sure? - Today's Monday and on Monday night, so the Baron said, he'll be back. - I hope so. Otherwise I'll see no way out. We must leave for a voyage, you know, my husband was very ill and must recover. He's already in Hamburg and I'll join him tomorrow. We'll travel on a ship, Balthazar. On a ship? - That's nice. - But terribly expensive. And I wanted to ask Papa if he can help me out a bit. - Perhaps I can ... - because the Baron left with me ... - No. I'll need a lot. Perhaps 2.000 marks. You see. You can't scrape together that much. Maybe this is Papa? Don't tell him that I'm here. I'll hide. Don't tell him I'm here. It's Herr Brack. He looks after the Baron's business affairs. I'll expect the Baron at 11 o'clock at the notary. At 11 o'clock sharp. - Certainly, Herr Brack. Good day. One moment, Herr Brack. It's about ... you've come at the right time. - The Baron's daughter is here. - Frau Dr. Helmer. So? Frau Dr. Helmer leaves on a voyage and she wanted to ask the Baron ... - For money? and since Herr Brack takes care of all the Baron's business affairs, I thought ... - How much? Madame mentioned 2.000. The lady is here? - Yes, I'll at once ... one moment, Herr Brack, this is really a coincidence... A good day. Herr Brack, isn't it? I have the honour, Frau Bank Director Helmer? - You've already heard the news? - Certainly. - Won't you sit down. - Thank you. I hear you're now managing my father's business affairs? You need money, Madame? Balthazar meant well, but he shouldn't have bothered you. - and Papa will be back tonight, so ... - I don't think Herr von Röcknitz carries 2.000 marks in cash with him. I see. That's possible. When one returns from a trip one is likely to have spent it all. If you could see me in my office tomorrow morning ... Thank you, Herr Brack. - In case of emergency I'll accept your offer. - Then please bring this form, filled out and signed by your father, and you'll hand it to me. Thank you, Herr Brack, that's very kind. Balthazar! At your service, Madame. Well, little Nora, we've managed that. Are you content? I am, Balthazar. - And now I'm hungry. - Good God, of course! Alberta, supper! - Alberta! - Alberta. Shall I light the candles? Of course. No. Wait till he's here. How pretty you look! Your old dress from the chest. - Yes! Papa gave it to me for the first citizen's ball. You remember? one two three ... I want Papa to believe that everything is like it used to be, and that his daughter is still unmarried. Let's have fun tonight. It'll do the Baron good. We've been worried about him. - Really? Is he ill? No, the Baron is still hale and spry. This is something else. I wonder if he has trouble with his manager or his estates. He didn't write me about it. - Maybe it's not that important. When the Baron left for the hunt he was again quite cheerful. He hugged me and he said: Cheerio, old steamboat. That's my papoosh. That must be him. Quick! I hope Balthazar didn't tell him. Well, Balthazar? Where's Papa? The Baron didn't come. He didn't? When does the next train arrive? Tomorrow morning. The Baron could be here at 11 o'clock. 11 o'clock? And my train for Hamburg leaves at 9 o'clock. How annoying. And I need the money. What shall I do? John Brack - acknowledgment of receipt - 2.000 marks v. Röcklitz Supper is served, Madame. Coming. Brack? No, of course you can't see Herr Brack. Next. Please, how much would you pay for this? Later. 2,50 Only 2,50? Then keep the thing. - But sir, this is an excellent instrument. A little sample, if you permit. So that's 2,50 Here you are. Good morning. How can I help you? Later. I'm Frau Helmer. Oh, Frau Bank Director. Yes, Herr Brack has instructed me. May I ask if you've brought the receipt. The receipt? Yes. Here you are. Thank you. Röckwitz, yes. A slight mistake, Frau Director. A mistake? Why? The date is missing. Yes, ladies trying to do business ... Here you are, 1.000, 2.000. - Thank you. Don't you want to count, Frau Director? - That's not necessary. It'll be correct, won't it? Because I'm in a hurry, my train is leaving, so - good morning. My best wishes, Madame Director. But Herr Labsaal! Later. The stones are good, but the setting's bad. We'll have to send the piece to Amsterdam. Certainly, just as you say, Herr Brack. I've heard complaints about you. About me? Herr Brack, that's not possible, I've always tried to ... Life might prevent us from being friends with people, but even with your enemies your hands should stay clean. Creatures come to us, you see. We squeeze them, we play with them, but they don't concern us. Creatures. Yes sir. Frau Director Helmer has left already. She was in a hurry. - Is that so? In a hurry? Herr Brack, a wire. Off with you! Here you are, Herr Brack, a wire. Oh my God, Herr Brack, our money? Go straight to the magistrate's court, hurry, get the Röcknitz file. - Yes, sir. - We need a power of attorney, so that no one can forestall. You'll accompany me. But the Baron hasn't returned yet. - Go ahead. By order of the Magistrate's Court Oldenfoerde II I hereby seize all valuables in Herr von Röcknitz's apartment. Herr John Brack has established his claim as main creditor. Here you are. You didn't know? He's indebted up to his ears. Indebted? No. No! We hold you responsible that nothing will be removed from this apartment and that no one touches the court's seals. What if the Baron comes back? The Baron passed away yesterday. A hunting accident. The usual cause of death. ... and so I signed with your name because I couldn't wait any longer. I hope you won't mind. 1000 kisses, your grateful daughter Nora Madame, one hears everywhere your husband's praises. But his greatest achievement was to bring you back to our town. Really? Sit, Veronika. ... and so I, in the name of all gentlemen present, also on behalf of our Berlin Main Offices, I profit from the occasion by expressing my satisfaction that Herr Dr. Helmer managed, in the first months of his activity here, to direct our business so successfully and diligently. I thank you, Herr President. Thank you, gentlemen. Let's proceed to item 2 of the agenda: Election of the members for our board of administration. I've taken the liberty to compile a list of candidates. May I ask the gentlemen to peruse it. It's my belief that only those candidates are suitable whose entire conduct is beyond reproach. I affiliate myself to the commendable view of our dear director. Allow me, Herr President. I only hope... I only hope that he succeeded to get hold of that required band of perfect angels for the board of administration. It won't be long. The director will see you soon. Director Helmer compiled this list with great diligence. I don't suppose there are any objections. Or are there, gentlemen? One moment, please. Absolutely. Absolutely, Herr President, all the candidates perfectly respectable and honourable, absolutely. Only let me humbly point out, not as criticism, more of a suggestion. I notice the absence of one person who has been warmly recommended to me as a candidate from different sides. And that's Herr Brack. John Brack. I'd like to ask Director Helmer why he ... I've anticipated this suggestion, Mr. Mayor. But considering the shadowy business Herr Brack conducts in our city... Allow me. Herr Brack's firm is established and registered. And if I'm not mistaken, Mr. President, the man grants considerable credit to our farmers. And he is, if I may say so as Mayor, one of my best taxpayers. He's absolutely desirable, isn't he? The Mayor may find his arguments decisive, I however reserve the right to verify certain information. You'll come to my house tonight to help out, won't you? - Of course, Herr Director. I've often helped out at home when we had visitors, and my wife was always satisfied. Really? Then it's ok. Herr Director? - Anything else? May I show the gentleman in? One moment. I'll ring. Have you gathered all the information about Brack? Yes, Herr Director. And? The Information Bureau was very well documented about Herr Brack's past. Really? Thank you. Counsellor Brack. Please sit down. I'm sorry you had to wait. I know, Herr Director Helmer, that your time is limited. But perhaps you can grant me an interview in this special case, also for personal reasons. I know, you're the main creditor of my late father-in-law. And that bankruptcy cost me a lot of money. I must point out that personal relations will not influence my decisions as director of this bank. And concerning the election of new members, and I suppose that's the reason for your visit, only considerations of objective factors can be decisive, only persons whose reputation is blameless ... This is superb. I beg your pardon? You want to investigate against me. Against you? But not at all. It's my duty to do so, Herr Brack. Only then can your candidature be considered. Maybe it would be to your advantage, Herr Director Helmer, in your own interest. I fail to understand you. I don't think the manager of a bank likes to lose one of his best clients. Please convey my respects to Madame your wife. I had the pleasure to make her acquaintance some time ago and I remember it fondly. Take a letter. - Careful, Fritz. The lamp. Your head! - My head? Why? This isn't a lamp. My dear child, this is a chandelier, it doesn't light, it illuminates. - Hold it steady. - Nora! Nora! How elegant you look. - Adorable. - When did you arrive? This morning. Hello, by the way. Meanwhile we've turned the house upside down. - Really. - Authorized by the master of the house. By the way, how do you find my decorations? Decorative? Very beautiful, Tönnesen. Really, you're a genius. Come with me, leave him on his ladder, it's been ages since we saw each other, Nora. - Alvine. They already left. ... and I find it astonishing that you, knowing about such an incriminating past, even considered your candidature for the board of administration. yours respectfully ... - That will do. Two copies. And put the original on my desk. - Yes, Director. I prefer to send the letter on Monday. Herr Brack mustn't know that we investigated even before his visit here. - Yes, Director. Director, allow me to wish you success for the reception you're giving tonight. Thank you, my dear. I wish you a pleasant Sunday. Help yourself. Thank you. Did you bake them yourself? - Oh no. Delicious, marzipan. Robert doesn't like me to eat sweets, but ... - But doesn't see you. He always says I'm ruining my teeth. That's typical of Robert. He's always so meticulous. What are you doing? - I'm clearing the buffet for tonight. Nora, you know, I think you should be happy with Robert the way he is. - I am. - Good day, Mama. Look at this. Six hats for one costume. Costume? Nora will wear a costume? Ah, for tonight's masked ball. - Of course not. - Then I'll go as bank director. How do you like this, Robert? Totally extravagant? Oh well ... But it's for Nora's dance. They cannot be a reception without a tarantella. Come along. Ah, Nora's dance. How original. When I think about my Fritz ... Please take this. I must get the recipe for my old man. And little Fritz, he lets things run their course. If I didn't take care, you know, I must treat him like a little boy Just the opposite of you two. Why? - In your marriage you're the child. I see. Now you too are going on about it. About what? Not taking me seriously. But I'm not a child. I've contributed more to our sitting in comfort in Oldenfoerde, so cheerful and healthy, more that you all know. - You? - Yes, I. One must only know how to act in the decisive moment. That's what counts. Alvine, you'd be surprised if I told you ... Tell me? What is it? Nothing. Do you like our home? I do. Wonderful. You know, when I think of the little house in Aalsen... Oh, Nora. You must be happy. I am. But sometimes I think that we were happier in the early days. You know, his new position has totally absorbed Robert. I hardly see him. But he's stayed the same. It's only that ... But Nora You've been out all morning and here it's a total mess. But after all, the Commissioner invited me, darling. You knew about it. - Yes, I did, and normally I don't mind my wife accepting such invitations, but on a day like this .... You tell her, Frau Alvine. Personally I adore summer excursions. But you, Helmer, tend to get your pants wet on such occasions. What a bustle we're having here today. The Commissioner sends his regards, Robert, and he's looking forward to this evening. He was very gracious to me. Was he? That suits me fine. - You see. I've also invited the Forrester and two of the Commissioner's nephews. You don't mind, or do you? Was that really necessary, Nora. We've already invited the Tönnesens. I mean, won't there be too many? I thought it'll be more fun. The reception we're giving tonight, my dear child, isn't fun but a duty. Does it have to be boring? I must ask you, my dear Nora, to leave the choice of the guests to me. You'd invite all sorts of people, with your poor judgment. And after all, I represent our home to the world and I carry the responsibility. And you carry it in an exemplary fashion. My poor little Robert. Allow me! I don't like it when a dubious gentleman calls at my office and boasts of being acquainted with you. Really? Who was it? That Brack. By the way, do know him personally? No. No? He claims to know you. - Yes ... Slightly. Slightly? I thought so. A Herr Brack and a Nora Helmer, have no business with each other, thank God. What did he want from you? Nothing of importance. Men's business. And not suited for my little Nora's ears. Why can you never talk seriously to me? About your worries and thoughts ... - But Nora! - Listen, Robert, it's possible that I, as your wife, could be of help to you in some men's business. - You help me? - Yes! - I don't think so. And it's a good thing too. You don't understand about those matters. - But ... - You see, women should be cheerful. They should distract us when we're worried. They should look pretty. That's right! Your hats have arrived. Six. The hats? Yes? What is it? I beg your pardon, Madame. Ah, Balthazar. What is it? Something wrong? Nothing wrong so far, Madame. I only want to ask, because I must leave for a few hours, but I promise I'll be back in time. It's because of the auction. What auction? But you know, Madame. The Baron's furniture, from our old apartment. And since I know all about it ... Papa's furniture? From our apartment? No! I knew nothing about it. Robert? Yes? Did you know that Papa's furniture is being auctioned off today? Of course I knew it, Nora, but I thought it better not to tell you. Why not? So that my little wife wouldn't worry about it. Yes, yes. It's hard. Little Nora. It's hard. Then you won't go? I thought so. Very well. Then I'll let Herr Brack know. Brack? Why? I was to invite Madame. - Me? - Yes. He urgently wants to see you. See me? When are they having the auction? This afternoon? - Yes. Very well. I don't understand your agitation, my dear Nora. You borrowed from this Herr Brack 2.000 marks. You paid him back and he gave you a receipt. So? He did. Then why does he want to see me? Good Heavens, there may be 1000 reasons. Maybe he wants you to do him a favour. Your husband is after all a bank director. But I don't think he'll tell Robert about the old affair. Really? You don't think so? Of course he won't. Business deals of that kind are based on confidentiality. I see. Perhaps it would be better after all to tell Robert about it. Of course it would. I should have told him straight away at the time. But I find it hard to tell Robert about certain things. You know him. He can be weird, especially when it's about money. I was afraid. Afraid? - Yes. Robert didn't know that Brack, at the time ... Nora! You're keeping something from me. Why? Is it that obvious? We shouldn't have secrets from one another. You haven't paid him back yet, haven't you? But I have! It's just that .... - Nora, let's stop pretending. Fortunately I can afford to help out my friends. And whom would I rather help than you. Believe me! I really paid back the money. Don't you trust me, Nora? More than anybody else. I wonder. - Really, Doctor. You're my only and best friend. And you listen to me when I say something. You take me seriously. You're very good to me. Good? Perhaps another word would be more fitting. Why do men always prevent us from sharing their life? We must be cheerful, tender and pretty. But isn't this too little? How can you be so sure what men want from a woman? I've read about it. In a novel. What was the title again? You mustn't forget that Robert is still very young. He's worked only for one aim these last years. And now he's reached that aim, he finds it fulfilling. But I don't think he loves you less than he used to. And I think it only pleases him to be in love with me. I must go now. I'll accompany you. You want to come too? Of course. Maybe you'll need me. ... going twice, sold. 140 Write it down. - For whom? - Lannerich. Lamprecht. And now, ladies and gentlemen, lot 35, a pianino. Made in the year 1865. Please make your bids. - 300. - Going once. - 350 - 350 - 380 - 380 - 400 Well? 400 going once, going twice and Ladies and gentlemen, this is a flawless period instrument. - So? - 401 401? No way! Ladies and gentlemen, I'll accept at 450. Agreed? 450 going once, going twice and sold. 450 for Herr Lohkarp. Papa gave me the piano. Now, ladies and gentlemen, a very precious item. A genuine French pendula. By a famous period craftsman, the minimum bid is 1.500, so? 1.500 going once Papa's clock. - 1.800 - 1.800 going once going twice, and 1.850 1.850 going once, going twice, and 2.000 2.000 going once, going twice and sold - Name? - Dr. Rank. Dr. Rank. Write it down. - Rank. - Brack. I thank you for your coming. Please follow me. I'll wait here, Madame. She shouldn't have gone to that auction, if only because of me. After all, Röcknitz was my father-in-law and his bankruptcy was quite embarrassing to me. Embarrassing? To you? Oh well. Of course. I beg you, Mama, to leave those cups alone for a minute. I feel nervous. - Nervous? Then don't walk about and sit down. I must talk to you anyway. As you wish. You've become a great man, Robert. And I understand best of all how this pleases you. Great men are allowed to forget about trifles. But your own wife isn't a trifle. But Mama, I love Nora more than anything. Of course you love her, and she too loves you. But it seems to me your love has turned into something careless. A bit of devotion and tenderness isn't enough, a woman needs more than that. But Nora has everything she needs. She needs you, Robert, and she doesn't have you. She has a provider and a lover, but no husband. And what do I have, Mama? I have a wife who doesn't seem to realize that money has to be earned. Since our long voyage Nora has completely changed. During the last months she must have spent almost 2.000 marks, without my knowing how she spent them. I'll speak to my husband about the board of administration, when the occasion arises. But after all, this is a business matter, to be settled among men, and I really don't know if I ... This isn't about business, Madame. My business deals don't depend on Director Helmer. For that I don't need him. And I don't need you. So? This isn't about money. I really don't understand you. You don't understand me. How could you? You grew up on this parquet floor. The apartment with its silk tapestries provided the frame which sustained you many years, and you don't drop out so easily. Stop it, Herr Brack. But I, Madame. - You? You too have everything. Indeed I have. You're right. I have everything. I'm rich, they need me, they salute me. But when it's my turn, Dr. Helmer in his armchair gives a frown. You mustn't think that my husband dislikes you. Thank you, Madame, but I've understood your husband perfectly. And I think he'll understand me too. What do you mean? Pardon me, Madame. One moment, Doctor. What have you told him? What is it my husband will understand? Director Helmer is about to investigate about my past. And I know the outcome. In the eyes of respectable men a whole life isn't sufficient to undo the wrong committed during one minute. I want to confess. Please don't, Herr Brack. I shall, Madame. You shall know about it. Especially you. Many years ago I forged a signature. My father's signature. I wasn't prosecuted at the time, my father covered me. But gossip forced me to leave town and go abroad. That's all. You'll admit that such an incident isn't serious enough to destroy a whole life. I think it depends on the reasons for committing such an act. Certainly. The reasons. There may be cases ... - Yes Yes, there are cases when one must commit an offense to help a beloved person. Yes. You most of all will understand this, Frau Helmer. I? I mean, you as a woman. 30 years ago I knew a woman in this town. We loved each other. We were young. I wanted to leave with her, and I needed money. Well ... you know I have very little influence with my husband, but I'll talk to him today. I'll do everything in my power for you. I thank you. The evil in men often forced me to act evil myself. But I'm not evil. I want to get out of those dirty business deals. Herr Brack, can I sell the big Persian carpet for 300? I said 400, not a penny less! Herr Kruse. Good. Gloves. Good. Over there. Over there. As you wish. Gentlemen, come with me. In there. Balthazar. Hasn't Madame come back yet? I don't understand, she should have been here long ago. Nora! - At last. - Alvine. If you only knew. Where's Robert? In his room. He's terribly upset. I've sent Fritz to him. Don't pull it too tight, I'm suffocating. - It must fit. Let me do it, Tönnesen, you don't understand about such things. Are you angry, darling? - At last. - Don't be angry. I'm a bit late but we'll manage. Now you're looking pretty. But what an angry face! Look at yourself in the mirror. Such an elegant man, such a nice wife and what an angry, angry face! You see? Now you're looking much prettier. All is well again? But now I must make myself pretty too. Fanny! - Yes, Madame. I'll be very quick. Did anything happen? Has somebody cancelled? Robert? Aren't you listening? I don't understand you. How could you go to that auction this afternoon? Was that really necessary? There's already enough gossip about the affair. Let them gossip. Surely they must realize that I'm interested in what becomes of our things. They are memories from my childhood. What have you bought? Bought? Why else would you have gone to the auction? What have you bought? - Well ... Papa's clock. You know, the one from his desk. Expensive? No. And my old piano was sold for almost nothing. Taste it. Well? How is it? A bit light. But salubrious. Are you by chance a tippler? I'm trying my best. Let's try some more samples. Well, Nora, ready? No, one moment. My powder. Help me with it. Robert. - Yes? Now you may come in. Well? Don't you dare? You're looking lovely, Nora, really. I'm very proud of you. A new perfume? - You like it? Very much. Do you like me? Everybody will be charmed. What about the master of the house? - He too. Will he grant his little Nora a favour, if she asks for it prettily? It isn't much, Robert. You needn't worry. Has my little Nora, at the auction ... - No! Only ... there I met ... Herr Brack Brack? Yes. Really? What did that person want from you? Oh, nothing of importance. He only asked me to put in a good word with you and I gave him my promise. He shall never enter the board of administration. Please, dear Nora, I have my reasons. I know. But why shouldn't he get in? Just because once in his life he committed some foolishness? He told you? Yes. Also why he did it at the time. He did it for a woman, Robert. That's something of an excuse. Isn't it? He forged a signature, my child. And there cannot be any excuse. Not even ... when you do it for a beloved person? When it's a matter of life and death? Robert! Then it's a different matter! You have a heart of gold, my dear child, but fortunately you're not familiar with those businesses. You don't understand about those things. A forger is a criminal. And the penal code is very explicit. And people who commit such crimes positively disgust me. How hot it is in here. I must say, the impertinence of that man. He's planned that very well. No! I'll see to it at once ... Fanny! Send for Kruse. What will you do? Here you are. Marvelous. I think this will please Nora. It's her father's clock. I see. From the auction? Yes. - Where shall we put it? The letter is on my desk at the bank, Herr Kruse. The address is on the envelope. After delivery you'll come back here at once. I'll be quick, Director. - Very well. Well? What's this letter? That doesn't concern you, my child. - Don't send that letter. I'm begging you. I'm begging you. Now we'll close the subject. Look Robert, your surprise. I see, there it is. Very pretty. Good evening, Doctor. Dr. Rank brought it as a gift. How so? A gift from Rank? But you told me you bought it yourself. - I did. Indeed. But I ... I beat her to it. So you too were at the auction? - No. That is ... he was. - We met there. I see. Well ... Director, the president has just arrived. I see. Thank you. Come with me, Nora. One two three Alvine! There you are, Herr Tönnesen. And in the future I'll say "à la bonheur". I've always longed to invite you to an intimate supper, only plain and wholesome food ... I can see you didn't spare any expenses. Let me ask you, Madame, will it be just the two of us? Absolutely. My passion knows no bounds. Is the director at home? Of course he is, Herr Brack. The Director gives a reception tonight. I myself delivered the invitations. The Mayor will be there, the Commissioner, the President of the Bank. It'll be a grand affair. Really? The Director gives a reception. Thank you. Madame. The dinner was excellent, delicious, as usual. Thank you. Madame. In fact, I'm a painter. An artist. My specialty are seascapes. "See-scapes"? Well, they enable you "to see". I understand. Painted by hand? Madame, I also to paint with my foot, but that costs twice as much. What on earth ... You're as cheeky as my Otto. Your husband? - No, my youngest. You forgot something, Madame? - Yes. - May I fetch it? No, I'll fetch it myself. Well, Bank Director? Do you like our party? Very much. I don't understand you, Frau Alvine. When you know what you want, and hold on to it, then you succeed. A bit of luck is needed too. Luck? What for? Am I right, Balthazar? Tonight it's like the balls at the old Röcklitz's. Exactly, Director. Sir? No, my dear Balthazar, I'd rather have another liquor. Here you are, Herr Brandt. Thank you. A question to destiny: Who wants to try his luck with me? - Commissioner? - With pleasure. - ... with Madame! Let's see what'll be the result. Well, colleague, feeling melancholic? How do you mean? But you're right. If all women were the picture of health like our esteemed hostess then we doctors would really be out of our jobs. But now it's your husband's turn, Madame. Yes! Yes! - Where is Robert? Fetch him. There he is. My dear Helmer. Excuse me, President. A little game. One moment. Allow me. Robert, do you want to try your luck with me? - Don't be afraid, there's only a small explosion. - Come on. Well? One. Two. Three. What did I tell you? Two hearts entwined. What more could one ask for? And now give each other a kiss, will you? Go ahead, my boy, show us a happily married young couple. Ladies and gentlemen, if you please, my wife will now give a little performance. I hope you don't mind, Nora? She'll be a real dancer. We brought the costume from our cruise in the Mediterranean. Please, Nora. Good evening, Director Helmer. Herr Brack? You? I thank you for your letter. Oh! Herr Brack. Please introduce us. Councilor Brack, Bank President Achelis. It's a pleasure to meet you. Even though you're a bit late. Forgive me. I had some work to do. That's jolly good of you, my friend, you've come to celebrate with us, a human amongst humans. My insider tip for tonight: the punch. The punch, excellent. Our dear Helmer has put in an effort. I thank you. You remember, dear President, this morning, at the conference. A distinguished appearance. Yes, absolutely. Brack. Thank you, dear Helmer, that you've picked up my suggestion, that was big of you. Look here. For the kids. This is wonderful. Now I know where I can put that thing, the ... Come on. You're sweet. Brack What a strange man. Let me compliment you. What Robert has achieved, he owes mostly to you. And now I'm superfluous. But my dear Frau Helmer. Brack Herr Brack? Ah, Doctor Rank, isn't it? I already had the pleasure. ... simply marvelous Come along, girls. You're right, Frau Helmer, one mustn't leave the men alone too long. You? What's the matter, Frau Helmer? What do you want here, for Heaven's sake? Believe me, I've tried everything, I've talked to my husband, but he doesn't want to. What else could I do? And he's written to you, hasn't he? A letter, just now. Then why are you here? You'll talk once more to your husband tonight. Are you going to force me? Yes. How dare you! I dare to remind you that the same crime Bank Director Helmer reproaches me of, was also committed by his wife. You forged your father's signature. At a time when he was already dead. On an IOU for which I paid you 2.000 marks. Madame, we've been looking for you. We've picked the music and the orchestra is ready. And we're the party's delegation to escort you formally. No, I can't right now. Maybe later. But Madame, please! Ah, here you are? Robert! Well ... Now I'm ready. But you must watch my dance. Come with me, Robert. It would be best, Madame, if you stayed alone for a while now. It all was a bit too much for you tonight. Thank you, Doctor. An encore, Madame. It was charming. Maybe later. Now everybody for the polonaise. If you please, the polonaise. Madame ... When we were interrupted a while ago, what you accused me of ... But that's ridiculous! How can you say such a thing? You must prove this. You know this clock, Madame? I do. A year ago I found this letter inside the clock. In this letter you asked for your father's forgiveness that you signed my IOU with his name. Is this true? Yes. Very well. I'll only leave this reception after you've spoken to your husband. Herr Brack! I'm begging you. Yes. Yes. Here she is. The Commissioner would like to ... - Madame, allow me ... Thank you, but you must excuse me. Robert, I must talk to you. Not now. Robert! Madame, we must get ready, otherwise ... Don't be angry, Commissioner, but ... I feel so dizzy. All that dancing right now ... ??? Don't stand, sit down, Madame. Balthazar, a glass. This will perk you up, Madame. Yes. Possibly, Herr Brack, the tone of my letter was a bit too severe. - Thank you. - Indeed it was. - But now ... It's useless to expect a different attitude from me. - My principles don't allow ... - Then you'll have to change your principles. What was that? You'll do what I ask you to. Listen to me, Herr Brack. You're going too far. How dare you! First you try to influence me through my wife. Then you intrude into my home without being invited. What on earth gives you the right ... Robert! Robert! I'd like to talk to you please. What gives me the right, Director Helmer? - One moment. Explain yourself clearly, Nora. What's the matter? What do you want? I only wanted to ... I thought ... you can't leave the guests alone for so long. At last. He seems to have understood me now. How could I have guess this? You* in this house? [*Du] I belong to this house. How so? You? Didn't you know? No. How could I? Ever since I've been back from ??? I've tried to find you everywhere. I also wrote. At the time too. Again and again. So I finally supposed you ... - I married Helmer at the time. Helmer? Yes, Captain Helmer, you knew him. Oh, him. You married him? Yes, he was very good to me. Perhaps I would have been ruined without him. Because I abandoned you. Right? That's all forgotten. Robert was so upset right now. - Robert? How so? Then the bank director is ... Yes. Robert is my son. You're his mother. Yes. Strange. Herr Rank, I must talk to you. Something awful. - Brack? I'm terribly afraid. Yes, Herr Brack? My hat and coat. - Yes sir. Please give a message to Director Helmer. Of course, Herr Brack. A waltz. Please, a waltz. I haven't told you everything this afternoon. Brack holds me in his power. Labsaal! Labsaal! Yes, Herr Brack? The depot is filthy. Filth and dirt everywhere. I'll see to it, first think in the morning ... in the morning ... Anything else? No. There's no other way out. I must talk to Robert. Even tonight. I beg you not to be hasty. But what about Brack? I don't want him to learn about it in that ugly manner. Tonight he'll do nothing, otherwise he wouldn't have left. You think so? - Yes. I only wonder ... what Robert's reaction will be. Well Balthazar, you're relieved too that it's over? Relieved. You go to bed now. All this can be cleared tomorrow. Very well, Director. Isn't it nice that Madame got back her clock? That was very considerate on the part of Dr. Rank. Certainly. A pretty piece. And expensive. 2.000 marks Dr. Rank paid for it. Really? Good night, Director. - Good night. I wish I could tear that piece of paper into shreds. But Robert will understand me, I'm sure he will. He will, Doctor. You're wrong about Robert, he can be generous. When it gets serious, you can count on Robert. I'm sure you can. He'll stick to me. Believe me. I hope so. Nora, where are you? In here, Robert. Promise me one thing, Nora. If things don't work out the way you hope, come to me. Nora, where were you? And the Doctor too is still here. I've kept Nora company for a bit. But now I'll leave. - But Doctor! - It's late. And Nora must be tired. It's been a grand evening, Doctor, wasn't it? I've been excellently entertained. Good night. - Good night. Show the doctor to the door. And don't forget to polish your stars. Thank you. I'll try to. Those bachelors... They never find their way home. I can understand. They're reluctant to return to their cold beds. They don't know how nice it is to be married to such a sweet little wife. Director? Yes? - Director I almost forgot. Herr Brack told me he'll see the Director tomorrow morning at the bank. Will he? I don't care. Very well. Turn off the lights, Kruse, and good night. How would you like it, Nora, if we moved to Berlin in a year? Member of the Head Offices. By the way, that's quite probable. The President made to me... a charming man, really charming- he made certain allusions and I was all ears. Two o'clock. From 8 to 2. And nobody getting bored! By the way, that Rank ... a strange man ... He must be very careless with his money. The Bank Director is always anticipating. The Bank Director retiring to bed. And Madame won't keep him waiting too long. A pretty melody. And you danced beautifully, Nora. By the way, the President was delighted. Those new shoes. Here already? You're looking pretty. I must talk to you, Robert. Talk to me? Now? But Nora! You must listen to me now, Robert. Please! What's the matter? Tomorrow morning Brack will see you. I know what he wants. He wants to blackmail you. Blackmail me? No way! - Yes he will. And he's capable too. Because he holds an IOU. How so? An IOU? From you? - Yes. It happened like this: It happened like this: He wanted to give me the money at the time only if I gave him an IOU for it. And I needed those 2.000 marks at the time. And you haven't pay him back? I have. But that's not the point. It's only that ... I didn't sign the IOU with my own name, but ... with Papa's name. With the name of ... But why? I don't understand? What did you ... Brack wanted the signature, Papa's signature. And Papa was away. And I needed the money badly at the time. What else could I have done? And you signed with your father's name? Röcklitz? Instead of Nora Helmer? And Brack holds this receipt? Yes. And how does that person know that you ... But Papa was already dead at that moment. Then ... that person has me in his power. Then I'm dependant of a crook. Robert, I hadn't given it a thought at the time. Who could have known this foolishness would have such consequences? You hadn't given it a thought? You call this a foolishness? You commit an outrageous act that must ruin your husband. And then you tell me calmly that you've acted foolishly? But this is ... But Robert, I thought you'd understand me. Understand you? Understand a crime? But Robert? You'll forgive me, won't you? I mean ... you'll keep on loving me? And help me? Robert? And who'll help me? I've toiled my whole life, finally reached a position, and now it's all in vain. And why? Because my wife is a criminal. - Robert! Yes, a criminal! You forged a signature. That's a crime. My wife. Bank Director Helmer's wife. My positon. My reputation. My whole life. All gone to hell. Haven't you forgotten something? I mean ... Haven't you forgotten something else you might have lost? What? Perhaps me? I don't understand you. No. You don't understand me. We don't understand each other. How often did you tell me that you loved me. And now? Where is your great love now? It's now that you should have been here for me. So what? I'm here. - Where? Where are you, Robert? I cannot find you. I've searched for you for so long. But all the time you were only with yourself. And I remained outside. Yes. I was good enough for your pleasure, for your comfort, for your vanity, but with your own life, the things that really concerned you, I had nothing to do with that. I've tried so hard to be a real wife to you. But you've always rejected me. And that's not a marriage, Robert. I told you he'd react like this. You've been expecting too much of Robert. But he's my husband. Why didn't he help me? Then he would have had to agree to Brack's demands. And believe me, a man like Robert could never get over such a thing. He wouldn't be able to continue his job, feeling he'd done something wrong. And the fact that it's been your fault, Nora, he'll never forget that. But since we loved each other ... Does he love you? I don't know. We've both made mistakes. Nora You ... I ... There's still something you'll have to explain to me Nora? What will you do? I'll go to Aalsen, to our old home. Back to Robert? I couldn't now. Do you have to go back to him? Nora You once told me I was your only friend. But you've known for long. My feelings for you are more than friendship. I've kept silent till now. But today ... A pity, Doctor. That I love you, Nora? No. That you've told me. You shouldn't have told me. Everything was perfect between us. Now most of all I have a right to tell you, Nora. As long as you were happy ... But now ... I don't understand you. Do you know that I'm about to ... end it all. End what? Doctor! You know that I'm ill. But you don't know how ill I am. They gave me another six months. Please Nora, never mention it to anybody. I would have left without any fuss. But now I want to ask something of you. Devote your next weeks to me. Let's travel. I know. You don't love me, even if I were a healthy man. But with you I want to see the world once more, before it'll vanish for me. I can't. Forgive me. But if I went with you now I'd lose Robert. And I mustn't lose Robert. But Robert is ... - You see, Doctor, there are people one cares about, with all one's heart. Then there are the people one loves. And I love Robert. More than anything. And I'll wait for him. You want to leave for Aalsen today? Yes. Yes. With the first train. I'll take you to the station. - No, thank you. You want to be alone. I understand that. Say hello to the old nest, to the bridge, to the beach. It'll be a beautiful day. The night is clear. My wife is here. She is. I know. Please look around. My apartment has three rooms. Forgive me, Doctor, I'm so excited. Nora has left. I thought she'd be here. She was here. So she was! I knew it. I've always known it. You've had it easy with my ridiculous confidence. And so had Nora! - Shut up! She was here and told me everything. Do you know that your wife loves you? Loves me? - Yes. I'm surprised too. She loves me and forges signatures. - And why did she do it? How should I know how she spent the money? But I know it. She spent it so that you could be well again, you fool. Because I told her that otherwise you'd die. Let me finish. You are so incredibly fortunate to have a wife who is entirely devoted to you. A woman whose heart is the most precious gift God entrusts to man. And this woman, once in her life, commits a foolishness. For you. And how do you thank her? With mistrust. With cowardice. With betrayal. Where is she now? Doctor, please tell me, where is she now? I don't know. I see. You don't know either. Forgive me. Oh, you're the first. Good morning, my boy. Good morning, Mama. Look, isn't this pretty? Tönnesens are still asleep. Nora too? What's the matter? Are you ill? Nora has left. Left? Why, in Heaven's Name? I've lost her. It's all my fault, Mama, I should have forgiven her. Forgive her ... You should have understood her. But she did something which was, by all standards. an infringement against morals and decency ... - Those are big words, my boy. We all, in your lives, arrive at a point where words alone don't help. Are you telling me this, Mama? You most of all, who ... - Yes, Robert. I too, once, got lost, like Nora. And I've learned through your father, my boy, that love means more than that. I think I haven't really known you till today, Mama. We hardly know ourselves. How can we judge other people? Where are you going? To the bank, to resign my position. Then Brack will have no more grounds for his blackmail. - Wait! There may be another way out. I must, Mama, I owe it to Nora. - Director? What is it? - From Dr. Rank. Where are you going? To Nora. Nora is in Aalsen. I think one mustn't always put the blame on life when it's all one's own fault. Guilt can be a great misfortune. But it can also better us. Make us kinder. More understanding. It's made me hard. And powerful. And rich. Yes, I know, you're sitting in your room, surrounded by your vaults, and they take good care of you. But basically you're a ... - An evil man. Right? Come on, say it. A poor man. You've done all your calculations. You wanted to subjugate life with your will. And you forgot there exists a power which is stronger than all of us. Which makes us richer than everything else. Yes. Our heart. We loved each other once. You ... loved me once. I've done you a great wrong, Helene. But I've atoned for it. I've never had any ill feelings against you. Not at the time, and not today. Johannes. Nobody has called me Johannes since those days. Here's the IOU. The letter. A miracle. We'll get over it, Nora. You and I. You? But you couldn't ... - I'll resign from my job. - No.- I will. Then I can defend you, help you ... - No, Robert, you mustn't. Think of your reputation, your plans, your career, everything would be over. No, it wouldn't. Everything would start anew. For the two of us, everything would start anew. Perhaps we've now learned how to be married. Perhaps ... The end Engl. subtitles: serdar202@KG 2020
