TREASURE ISLAND At the end of the XVlll century in a southern glen in one of the counties of Ireland arose a rebellion. Defeated in a clash with government forces a remnant of a rebel detachment retreats. Misses Hawkins. Doctor Livesey is wounded. We need to hide him. Get your strength back, Livesey. We will make our way across the gorge by the old mill to our camp. And then continue our struggle. Commander! Our detachment in the southern glen suffered a setback. Doctor Livesey with a number of our men retreated along the coast in the direction of Benbow. And why are you here, Captain? My Commander, we have no gunpowder. We have nothing with which to fight. Gunpowder? You have no gunpowder? Well, without gunpowder you can still fight. Swords? Knives? Your teeth? With your teeth you can tear open the throats of our enemy. Or don't you still have your teeth... Captain? Here's gunpowder, Smollett. But that's the last of it. Yes, that's the last of it. This means we must use it sparingly. This means we should make a surprise attack on those mad dogs. And take the powder that they have. But then you are forgetting, Smollett, about our friends from liberated France. At any time now a ship should arrive with arms. But perhaps wouldn't it be wise...? It would be best, Smollett, to carry out the Commander's order. Get through to Benbow and rescue Livesey and his men. Be seeing you again soon Misses Hawkins. Take good care of Livesey. A tankard of rum. Jenny, a tankard of rum. Yes, mother. I'll stay here for a while. I'm a congenial man. Rum, bacon, eggs. That's all I need. Where are you from? Who are you? What business is it of yours, Misses? Life is not peaceful in these parts. Call me Captain. Less jabber that I am here. Jenny, a room upstairs for the Captain. Yes, mother. We don't have any help. Just me and my daughter. Better this way. I'd like to carry this chest myself. Keep a watchful eye. Should a seaman with one-leg make his appearance, this means all hands on deck. Livesey! Jenny! Who is making all that noise down below, Jenny? Don't be alarmed, Livesey. It is some seaman. He will be staying upstairs. Thank you, Jenny. I was with you in your heroic service, A storm thundered over the land. I was with you, And held back my tears, And my eyes were dry. So in your ardent mission, Quietly and bravely, Go and fear nothing. If they harm my man, His woman will, On the enemy avenge him. If they harm my man, His woman will dress. His grievious wounds. There where horses tread over the dead, Where the entire land is red with blood, Allow that she may help you, Protect you from projectiles. My sweet love, For whatever shall arise, For you I am ready. Go and fear nothing. If they harm my man, His woman will. On the enemy avenge him. If they harm my man, His woman will dress. His grievious wounds. Mate, boldly unfurl the sails. Yo-ho-ho, make merry like the devil. Eh, mistress! Rum! Where are you, dear Billy? Why do you not come out to meet your old shipmate? I bring you greetings from he who has one leg. Some killed by the bullet, the rest by old age Yo-ho-ho, all the same all're overboard. Pieces of Eight! Pieces of Eight! Old Flint's parrot? That means you are here, Bill. Show yourself and be quick! Or have you decided to play hide-and-go-seek with me? Okay. You have followed my tracks, Dick. Tell me what you came for. I came for the map. Were you unable to keep what was yours and now you chase after that of others? Get out of here! Eh, Billy, Billy. Many waves have flowed past since we last met. You have a short memory. You forget the law of the Gentlemen of Fortune. Give me your right hand. The Black Spot! Whatever, I will not hand over the map. How terrible. I need to weigh anchor. Livesey. This is the seaman I spoke to you about. He's been injured. Rum! The word rum and the word death mean for you one and the same. Trust me. I am a doctor. All doctors are swabs. What do they understand about seafaring men? I have been in such lands as hot as boiling pitch, where men drop round with Yellow Jack. And quakes shaking the land like waves in the sea. What do you know, doctor, of lands like these? And I have lived on rum. Yes! Yes! Rum for me has been meat and water and a wife and a friend. The rogues! They got wind of where I am! I do not fear them! Billy Bones will cast off and again will slip away from them. Dick is a dreadful man. But the one-legged one who sent him after me is even more dreadful. Don't let them have the chest! Don't let them have it! In there... in there is the map. I alone know the place. Old Flint himself gave it to me before his death. Keep close watch. Pieces of Eight! Pieces of Eight! Rum. The map is probably hidden here. He kept speaking about the chest. He sailed with the infamous pirate Flint. Here's the map. In the name of the King! We are looking for those who rose in rebellion in the southern glen. Rebellion? What kind of rebellion, sire? Don't pretend to know nothing. We have reliable information that you have given refuge to these marauders. Be reasonable, sire. Enough of this jabber. Conduct a search. I beg your pardon, sire. Are you looking for someone? But there is no one here, sire. Other than our guest, Billy Bones. Yes, and... We will see for ourselves. Eh? Who is here? Your name! My name is Billy Bones. People call me Captain. From what ship? I lost this eye on the ship of the fearless Admiral Hawke. I am waiting to fight again so I can lose my other eye. Under the command of Admiral Hawke? Hands up! Stand back! Give yourselves up! Take a look at our captives! I am glad to see you, Livesey. There's bad news. A storm destroyed a ship on which our friends from France were bringing us arms and powder. My Commander, we will have arms, and we will have powder! Look at this! We found this map in the trunk of the dead seaman Billy Bones here. This a map of the island where the infamous Flint hid his horde of treasure and pirate arms. But in order to get to this island we will need a ship. We will need funding. If we give half of this treasure to someone wealthy, well, even to the swindling Trelawney, he will provide as much as we need for equipping the expedition Trelawney? How can we do business with this dirty, money-grubbing swindler? There is no other way. We must take advantage of this scoundrel. We will try to settle accounts out of his purse. This will be our chance so those he robbed his whole life will get some of it back. I am afraid that he will find out who we are. Allow me to talk it over with Squire Trelawney. If I go to him, he will suspect nothing. Great idea, Jenny. Go ahead. But, sire, only that this must be an absolute secret. My child, can it be you do not know that I can be silent as a tomb? Your father rented land from me for 40 years. I have know you since you were a baby. You can trust me fully. Sire, you can be many times richer than you are now. You. Sire, can acquire an immense treasure. Yes? But you will be startled, sire. Don't let this bother you. Tell me. Tell me, child. Sire, have you heard of Captain Flint? Have I heard of Captain Flint? He was the most bloodthirsty of all pirates. He robbed and sank hundreds of ships. Oh, he was a daring marauder. I can frankly confess to you I am sometimes even proud that he was an Englishman. But why do you ask have I heard about Flint? Because there are those who know where Flint's treasure is hidden. Tell me, child. Only remember that this is a secret. An absolute secret! No one must know about this. Yes, you see, I... I have only told this to you, sire. Well, yes, just to me, if to others then the whole country will know. Well, tell me, tell me. Yes, but keep in mind that half of the treasure belongs to those who divulge this secret to you. One third perhaps? No, sire, one half. Well, okay, only do not trouble me with this. Do not trouble me. Gentlemen... Sire Trelawney wishes to speak with you. My Commander, we are ready to depart. Well, all the best to you, Livesey. You and Smollett. I can only entrust to you such a difficult and dangerous matter. You will have to keep careful watch on this rogue Trelawney. From him we can expect both meanness and treachery. Every hour, every minute, you should feel the beating of our hearts. And we will feel the beating of yours. We will hold out till your return. Only make it quick. And do not return empty-handed. Well, I wish your success. Good-bye, Jenny. Livesey, take me with you. No. That would be impossible, Jenny. I cannot expose you to such danger. Livesey! Doctor! Doctor! What is taking you so long? No, no, it would be impossible. You are holding us back, doctor. Impossible? Keep close eye on the trunk. In it are important documents. Here for a long time? I need to buy a ship. We will embark on a dangerous voyage. For one purpose. I am willing to help you in this, sire. I have an old friend. He can arrange everything for you. Splendid. I am grateful to you... for this. In the tavern "Spyglass" have gathered seafarers of all the seas and oceans. This by the way is my friend Blandly whom I spoke to you about, sire. I need to buy a ship. It must be a fine ship, seaworthy with respect to any danger. I have such a ship. A splendid schooner. The "Hispaniola". And it has a ready crew. My esteemed sire. My fine friend, Mister Blandly. We can trust him fully. Cheers for my fine friend. Esteemed Squire Trelawney. Cheers for the Captain. Hurrah! Cheers for Admiral Trelawney! Dear friends, I introduce to you your Captain... your ship's doctor... and I will be leader of the expedition. And you may like to call me... Admiral. Cheers for Admiral Trelawney... Hurrah! Hip hip... hurrah! Hip hip... hurrah! Hip hip... hurrah! Won't you need a boatswain on your ship, Admiral? A better boatswain you will not find. You perhaps would like to know who I am? I am John Silver. I lost my leg in battle on a ship under the command of Sir Walter Raleigh. And everyone can attest to this. Israel Hands! You surely remember this. Already one-legged, John Silver with his dagger laid out 9 of the enemy. Anderson... do you know John Silver? He who remembers how San Tomas was taken at the mouth of the Orinoco River cannot forget one-legged John. And you, George Merry? Do you know John Silver? When I served under the banners of Duke Cumberland... Is there any of you who does not know John Silver? I! I do not know John Silver. It seems to me, sire, that the selection of the crew should be entrusted to me, the Captain. Dear Captain... you see before you able and experienced seamen. Perhaps they do not look like it, but all are courageous, however reckless. They are loyal and reliable men. Courageous, however reckless, loyal and reliable men. All the same, sire... Well, a couple of your own if you wish you can hire yourself. But the rest... I am taking from my friend, Blandly. I ask that you, esteemed Admiral, take a look at the Hispaniola, "flagship" of your "squadron". Smollett, it seems to me that this one-legged man and his men know about Flint's treasure not less than we and suspect the purpose of our voyage. Perhaps it would be better if... What is most important is as quickly as possible get money and arms. Gray! Gray, find Joyce and Hunter. Get prepared for departure. On the seas and oceans, Guiding us an evil star, We ramble many lands, And nowhere settle down. Becoming our sea captain, Was enmity black as night. What more to darken us, We have nothing to lose, Drink till we are drunk, A wave there will be, Laden with blood. Mate, boldly unfurl the sails, Yo-ho-ho, make merry like the devil, Some killed by the bullet, the rest by old age, Yo-ho-ho, all the same all're overboard. The sea consumes the wreckage, Darkness buries the dead, And blackness hides from the world. The deeds of those who wander the seas. Time and again blackness takes over, Black our pirate flag, Darkness gave us birth, We scatter like the plague, The hour approaches, Hear the command, The devil's after us. Mate, boldly unfurl the sails, Yo-ho-ho, make merry like the devil, Some killed by the bullet, the rest by old age, Yo-ho-ho, all the same all're overboard. All the same all're overboard. Do you know where the crew for the ship of Squire Trelawney has gathered? And who might you be? My name is Jim. I would like to go along on this voyage. A cabin boy for the Admiral. What can you do, boy? Do you know how to cook? Yes, I can cook. And can you drink rum? All of it. And without stopping. Let's see if we can get a seaman out of you. If you are called daring, This means you do not fear a fight, And you conduct yourself gallantly, To give proof to your courage. The weak in spirit and body, Are not part of our family. The weak will be beaten, And the daring be victorious. The sea sings, The sea sings, the sea sings, Mate, boldly unfurl the sails, Yo-ho-ho, make merry like the devil, Some killed by the bullet, the rest by old age, Yo-ho-ho, all the same all're overboard. How do you do, Joyce. You are not one for heavy work. It's nothing, Captain. On the island there will be time for rest. How do you do, Gray. Good day, Captain. Give me back my Pieces of Eight! Stop fighting! Can it be, boatswain, that you do not know on board ship gambling is prohibited? Hey, you, I'll throw your bones overboard. Why are muskets in the hands of the seamen? Boatswain, you have lost control over the crew! I have already warned you. One more reprimand and you will be relieved. Stash the money! Hide the Pieces of Eight. Pieces of Eight, Pieces of Eight, Pieces of Eight! It is time to seize their arms. And throw them overboard. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Throw them overboard and we'll be without the map. You have always been an idiot, Israel Hands. You old monkey. If we have all the arms and put pistols to their temples, the map will be in our pocket. And who will navigate the ship to the island? I, George Merry. Israel Hands. We are all seamen. You would like to say, sailors, Anderson. I have been out to sea more than you. And still I would not try it. So what do you have in mind, John? Don't let on that we know about the purpose of this voyage. Let them dig up the treasure and stow it on the Hispaniola. Well, and then? And then, we set out on the way back, and let them take a walk. What?! To the bottom of the sea. So says the great pirate law of the Gentlemen of Fortune. Or slaughter them like swine in accordance with the law. The way it was always done by Old Flint. And the good soul, Billy Bones. Yes, good soul Billy was a master at such business. "The dead do not bite," he would say. O Lord, remember King David and all his meekness. Yes, the dead do not bite. When I get rich and become a member of Parliament, I will go about in a golden carriage. Not in the least would I want that a "tattler" among them come barging in like the devil on a monk. When I served under the banners of Duke Cumberland... But all the same we need to seize their arms. And I will do this, John. That's right. We need to seize their arms. For a long time the rope has longed for your stupid neck. Who is there? Ship's boy, Jim. Ship's boy, Jim? We have been to sea a long time. Why am I seeing you for the first time? The boatswain took me on. What do you want, cabin boy? Jenny? Jenny Hawkins? How did you wind up on the Hispaniola? What is the meaning of these clothes? About that later, Captain. I have something more important to tell you. I heard them talk. They know everything. They want to seize all the arms and kill all of you. This means Livesey was right. I will call him now. We must act. No! No! No! I implore you... I implore... Do not tell him that I am here. Let him know about that later. The crew does not suspect that I am informing on them. I will remain among them and watch them. If I find out something, I will report to you. What are you gadding about with the Captain for? The crew could not have found out about anything. It is a lie. A lie. I was as silent as a tomb. Your seaman is a liar and a traitor. Show him to me. Call him here and I will beat the scoundrel to death. Enough... I am the Captain here. And the principal source of rumor you can see in a mirror. I propose that we attack them by surprise and decide the matter in an open fight. Your zeal bestows honor on you, Livesey, but we are outnumbered. You, I, Joyce, Redruth, Hunter, Abraham Gray, in short, all that we took on in Dublin. And perhaps also that seaman who informed you about the conspiracy. Mister Trelawney is not included in the calculation. This means 6 against 13, or in best case 7 against 12. And so we do not attack but wait and prepare ourselves. I understand, dear Livesey, that this is not so pleasant, but in our circumstances they are all a threat to our lives. We must act as follows: You, Livesey, take the map Mister Trelawney has. No... No and no! I am the Admiral! I am the leader of the expedition. I am the owner of the Hispaniola. You, Livesey, take the map Mister Trelawney has. W - what kind of map? The map! The map... the map. And hide it so that it cannot be found by not only the pirates but also none of us. And what about the arms? We will like this... In the morning by order of the Captain began the transfer of weapons from the munitions chamber to the officers' cabin. Hey, you, obey the Captain! Brainless moron. Blockheads. You fools! Hey, cabin boy, get to work. I don't tolerate favorites aboard this ship. And so as soon as we reach the island and drop anchor, we will permit all hands to go ashore. But if they...? But if they try mutiny and demand the map, we will shut ourselves up in the cabin and defend ourselves. But if they...? The arms are in our hands. They have only a few muskets. Most everything is on our side. But I think that will not happen. John Silver has strict control over them and will not allow any mutiny. They will go ashore and try to find the treasure without a map. Next, we will go ashore and occupy Flint's fort. There we will be secure. And while like blind kittens they wander over the island, we will dig up the treasure, get back before them to the Hispaniola, and set sail back. Take in the jib. On the 31st day after departure from Dublin the Hispaniola was at the destination of its dangerous voyage. We are all tired. Some time ashore won't hurt anyone. Double rations of grog for the leave ashore. Hurrah! Everyone go ashore! Everyone! When I served under the banners of Duke... Take the barrels with you. Everyone. Everyone. Morons. I know you men. You get your fill of rum and then carouse around. Easy, John. Remain behind on board, you... you... and you, Anderson. Keep careful watch. If they start anything, report to me. Watch over the jolly-boat, cabin boy. What devilish delusion is this? Flint himself said to me, "White rocks... between the three pines... 50 paces to the right an entrance to a cave." Where is the cave then? O Lord, remember King David and all his meekness. You both, most likely, were as drunk as camels. You and Captain Flint. Tricking the pirates, Captain Smollett and his friends go ashore on the west side at old Flint's blockhouse. If in our struggle, we were to have such a blockhouse, we could from inside shoot all the king's dogs like partridges. After we get Flint's treasure, we can have a fortress even better than this. What? What did you say, Captain? Oh... now it is all clear to me. Now, finally, I understand those whom I am dealing with. Better late than never. So how can you do this? If I had known what kind of men you are, I would have been better to have gone off with John Silver. It is never too late Mister Usurer. That's right. The best place for such a usurer is with the pirates. What happened on the Hispaniola? Those animals got us drunk and then took off to the island. Where is Silver? I don't know. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, Hey, while you were here looking for the treasure like stupid goats, those animals tricked us, leaving the ship and taking with them the map of the island. Hold course to the west for the blockhouse of old Flint. Here is the forest. We must go to the white rocks. And then go up the mountain. Livesey! Livesey! Jenny! Jenny Hawkins? Hey-hey! Who goes there? Captain John Silver wants to talk with you. Captain John Silver? I have never heard of such. It is I, sire. After your desertion, the crew chose me as captain. What do you want? Only the map of the island. If you give me the map, we will get the treasure, and on the way back set you free ashore in total safety. You will not get the map. You will not find the treasure. You have no compass, and in any case you do not know how to navigate the ship. If you give yourselves up, I promise to spare your lives. In such case, instead of me, talk will be through my muskets. Stop! Stop! We will hand over the map. If you do not hand over to them the map, I will reveal to them that cabin boy Jim... Livesey! That you would desire to betray old John, John Silver does not like traitors. Get away from here! We will yet meet up with you cabin boy. We will yet fry your heels. You will know what happens when you gad about the Captain turning informer... Well now, noble gentlemen. When you fall into the hands of Gentlemen of Fortune, you who live will be envious of the dead. I will teach you to fight, my friends. Remember only one thing, each shot you make, each death blow on the pirates brings us closer to victory for our people. To arms, men! Long live liberty! Beat, drum, the signal of our march, Time does not wait, comrade, onward on our road, The enemy will not take us alive, Our path leads us to victory. We shall have our dawn. We are a free and proud people, We fight for every step, Rifles on our shoulders and feet in our stirrups, Those not with us are cowards and the enemy. Rifles on our shoulders and feet in our stirrups, Those not with us are cowards and the enemy. Beat, drum, the signal of our march, Time does not wait, comrades, onward on our road, My friend, sing as I sing to you, Everyone in the struggle for this land of ours, Stay till the end in our struggle. We shall do away with our bloody times, By our fierceness in battle. Rifles on our shoulders and feet in our stirrups, Those not with us are cowards and the enemy. Rfiles on our shoulders and feet in our stirrups, Those not with us are cowards and the enemy. To your positions! Fire! Get those branches in place! Quickly! Help! They have abducted Jenny. Disastrous, Livesey! We are still outnumbered. We must bide our time, Smollet. Taking "cabin boy Jim" captive, the pirates withdraw from their siege of the blockhouse. Do not fear me, cabin boy. I despise the one with one leg. I alone know the secret of the island. The treasure is... in my hut. Your hut? Ben Gunn?! You stupid old goat. Why is it you could not miss hitting that no good, the very one that old Flint missed, the first time in his life that Flint missed his target. It's he, Ben Gunn, who helped Flint hide his treasure. If we had taken him alive, we could find out where the treasure lies without the map. You dirty old goat! Enough joking around. O Lord, remember King David and all his meekness. Stand back! The captain here is I! Dare even just to touch, and you will suffer the consequences from me. Though my legs are not all here, I broke my crutch... over this animal! At any rate I see what color you all have inside. You remember your rights well, Captain. But you forget our common interest. We are going out to confer. Only I know who your are. I will try to save you, girl. But if things turn out poorly for me, save old John from the noose. I... I will do all that I can. One good deed for another. The wind is getting stronger. I'll be captain. That's right! Let's go. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Ah, the Black Spot?! I knew it. You want to be captain, Hands? Give me a light. My pipe has gone out. Quickly! Get down off the barrel! We are choosing a new captain! O Lord, remember King David and all his meekness. I really thought that you knew the law of Gentlemen of Fortune. You must first divulge your accusations. And I will answer to them. Until then... I am Captain. And your Black Spot is worth no more than mold-covered crumbs. You want to know the accusations? It is thanks to you that we sailed to this island. It was you who let them off the ship together with the map. It was you who did not let us settle with this betrayer. Down with him! Under the banners of the Duke of Cumberland... Quiet! Because you were quiet these past 20 years when John Silver begins to speak. Friend and brother of Italian pirates. No one can accuse us of selflessness or compassion. You don't make a bit of any sense. What did your mothers there think seeing you off to sea? You want to know why I did not give you the cabin boy? We need a hostage. We can fry his heels any time. But while he lives, you can trust old John, to save the boy they will bring to us the map and treasure. Both map and treasure? Yes, yes, both map and treasure. Captain! Doctor Livesey. Tell Doctor Livesey that the Captain of the Hispaniola, John Silver, agrees to speak with him. Fine fellow, John. A good head you have. What brings you here, sire? I seek to free cabin boy, Jim. Is that so? The cabin boy surely seems to have been of great service that you so value his skin. Well, then... We can return to you your cabin boy under these conditions: Bring us the map of the island. The very map that you stole from our friend Billy Bones. Together with us go where the treasure is hidden. Otherwise, who knows perhaps you might give us a false map, and have us like a bunch of old camels search for the treasure where there is none. We will get the treasure. We will load it onto the Hispaniola. You will navigate the ship to the nearest port, and we will set you free on shore. And then cabin boy Jim will be returned to you in your full possession. I must decide this together with my friends. Give us... 24 hours. 24 hours? Seeing that this involves a half million pounds sterling and a human life, we can do that. During these 24 hours cabin boy Jim must be kept in total safety. And that we can do. Cabin boy Jim will spend these 24 hours in my captain's quarters under the watch of two of my trusted men. I will stand guard over the cabin boy. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. You... and you... George Merry will answer for the cabin boy with your heads. When I served under the banners of... The delay of 24 hours gave Livesey and his friends the possibility to dig up the treasure, return with it to the Hispaniola, and free Jenny. It's all gone. Someone has been here before us. Do not lose heart Redruth. Now I am beginning to understand what Jenny wanted to say. Joyce, Redruth will tell you what must be done. Smollett, now everything is clear. With Redruth... the treasure... Jenny on the Hispaniola... I spoke with John Silver. And Jenny persistently pointed at the wall in the hut. We must no matter what free the hut from the pirates and examine it. I have a plan. Don't do anything. John Silver and his henchmen are watching. We cannot force our way to the treasure. Let's go. Water. Water! My hands have become numb. The ropes are cutting my chest. I trust that when we share the treasure, Mister Trelawney will highly value my good will? Oh, yes. The henchmen of one-legged John are roaming about the edge of the woods. We must strengthen our defenses. Mister pirates... Gentlemen of Fortune. We have no reason to quarrel. We can quickly find things in common with you. You are not mutineers who want to take away all that is good from us. I am willing to hand the map over to you, and we will divide the treasure up in half. And we accept you into the honorable family of pirates. The map! Stop! Stop! Wait for your Captain! Stop! Help! Help! Give me a hand! Give me a hand! It is I! They ran off. They abandoned their Captain. But I will not give them the treasure. If I understood Jenny correctly, the treasure is somewhere here. Here is some kind of a strange hole. Smollett! Here it is! Here it is! Jenny was not mistaken. Those in the southern glen not in vain await our return. Gold... gold... So much gold... and I such a dummy I was... I did not know it was next to me. Quickly, quickly to the Hispaniola! Mate, boldly unfurl the sails, Yo-ho-ho, make merry like the devil, Some killed by the bullet, the rest by... In three voices this chanty comes out better. Give me the key for the cabin. When I served... under the banners... of Duke... Cumberland... When drunk time flies faster than when sober. By my watch 24 hours have gone by. Give me the key. We will quickly find where the map is. O Lord, remember King David... I will not give it to you! Hey, cabin boy! You have sat long enough in this dog kennel. Let's go make confession! In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Livesey! Jenny! We are here, Jenny! Our voyage is over, Commander. Arms and treasure have been delivered to camp. Thank you, friends, thank you Jenny. You most credibly dressed as a male and became a cabin boy. You have proved that young patriots know how to fulfill their duty to their country. I appoint you aide-de-camp. To the detachment, Doctor Livesey. Hurrah! Long live Liberty! Hurrah! Beat, drum, the signal of our march, Time does not wait, comrades, onward on our road. Eh, sing both young and old, Onward for the lives of our youth. Boldly in this final struggle. Let triumphantly shine over all, Our banner of pride and liberty. Rifles on our shoulders and feet in our stirrups, Those not with us are cowards and the enemy, Rifles on our shoulders and feet in our stirrups, Those not with us are cowards and the enemy. The End
