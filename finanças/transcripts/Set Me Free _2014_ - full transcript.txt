Let us pray. Dear Father, these children are still young. They need your constant guidance and love This lovely couple has taken in these children as their own. Brother Joseph and sister Regina, please shower them with blessings. Bless Isaac's Home with happiness and peace and help this family to live according to your will. We pray in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. - Amen. - Amen. You're home early. I skipped self-study. What were you hiding in a hurry? Nothing. Go on out. We have chicken tonight. What is it? Did you go through my stuff again? No, I said it's nothing. Come out for dinner. Dad hates it when you're late. - I hope you enjoyed dinner. - It was delicious. - It was a humble dinner. - Not at all. I ate so much. Father... Next week is Christmas and then New Year's. So I prepared a book and card for you and the Sisters. I wanted to buy something better like scarves but they were too expensive. So I wrote a card instead. This book is a good read. Thank you for caring for us. How thoughtful! What's your name? Sorry, I haven't memorized your name yet. Park Yeongjae.. John. Everybody here calls me John. His dream is to become a priest like you. He diligently attends Mass and participates in prep seminary. So we call him by his baptismal name at home. Father... - Please look after John. - Thank you, Lord. He is so considerate for his age. Thanks for the gift. Sister Regina, this is a miracle possible only by the grace of God. John, are you really serious about seminary? Yes. Study hard and I'll ask the Provost to write you a recommendation. - Really? - Of course. Thank you! Thank you! John, see you at Mass. Thanks for the gift. - Good-bye. - Bye. - We'll be going. - Good-bye. The others should learn from you. The rascals only take and never give. Don't go roaming about but stay home and study. You know how hard it is to get into seminary. - Now go and study. - Okay. What about breakfast? What that asshole makes stinks. Tell him l went out early for self-study. Okay. Good morning. - What about Beomtae? - He went out early for self-study. Self-study at the crack of dawn? He'll be leaving soon so I shouldn't bother. Can vocational school students enter the seminary? Yes, there's no restriction. Attending prep seminary is most important. Did you tell your dad? I haven't heard from him for a while. He was so sure to come for you in just a couple of years. Priests can't marry so you need your parents' permission. It doesn't matter. You and Mom are my parents. I should call him. You know you have to go back home like Beomtae, don't you? Yes... I'll make the call. So you can't sell it at $100? - 100 would be too cheap. - You're like a fucking salesperson. - Letting your best customer down? - Then 120 and no less. 120? Where do you get all this stuff? This son of a bitch is a walking shoe store. Do you go around stealing every night? That's none of your business. So who wants this at 120? Okay. 120. Now I'm broke. Count it. Don't tell your parents. The class teacher wants to see you. - You wanted to see me? - Yes, Yeongjae. Sit here. What was the name of your group home? Isaac's Home. Do they treat you well? - Yes. - That's good. They've sacrificed their lives to care for other children. So getting a job and making money is a way of repaying them. Instead of getting a job, I'm going to seminary. That's what you all say at first. You want to enter a good college. But after all everyone wants a good job. College is a waste of time and money. Yes... What did you call me for? Your father is here. He needed some of your documents for your brother's scholarship. So I told him to see you before he left. He said you wouldn't like seeing him. - No, he comes by sometimes.. - I see. Your father must've had his reasons for leaving you there. Everyone has some kind of painful memory from childhood. It's not a painful memory. My parents didn't put me there. I went by myself 'cause I couldn't stand them. If you're done I'll return to the classroom. The consequences of the 'Imo Military Revolt'. The 'Treaty of Jemulpo' was ratified in 1882. Qing Dynasty's intervention... Let's read about the intervention. The 'Imo Military Revolt'.. Sir... - Over here. - Hello. - Was it hard to come here? - No, I came here on one subway line. - Good, have a seat. - Is this him? Yes, he's my first son. He's very smart. But he chose to attend a vocational school. Academic schools are of no use. It's better to do well at a vocational school. - Your son has foresight. - Yes, he's smart. What's your name? His name is Park Yeongjae. He plays with plamodels and likes to read so he's very shy. Say something. What is your future dream? I hope he lives according to the Lord's vision. As he grows older, my concerns grow deeper. I see. When can he start coming to church? Well... He stays up too late studying so he can't get up Sunday mornings. My second son is better, but I'll see to it... Pastor. You've got it all wrong. I'm not his son. We don't live together. Have you heard of Isaac's Home? It's quite famous among Catholics. And fuck church. I'll become a priest. Thank you for the drink, mister. He's going through puberty. Hey. What's wrong with you? Stop acting up and come back in. Let go. - Get back in. - I said let go! What's wrong? My reputation is on the line. I said I was sorry. Isn't that enough? This is all for your brother. So I can pay for his lunch money. Your hands and feet are fine. You have no physical defects. Go out and work! Why can't you work for money? Aren't you embarrassed living like this? This sucks. This really sucks. You'll be punished for living like this... Dad. He is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church... - I'm back. - You're late. I served at Mass. - Yeongjae, go into your room. - Why? It disappeared from this house so we shouldn't rule anybody out. But he wouldn't... Someone is stealing stuff from the storage room. I see... We can't overlook your sins. This is clearly an act of burglary. If you come clean, we'll forgive you. Or else, we'll have to go to the police. This is very serious. Got it? - Yes. - Now close your eyes. - I'm back. - Wait. I heard you went out early today. As I know, even academic schools don't start that early. Then call the school and ask. Do you go out early to sneak stuff out of the storage? No, I don't. Open your bag. You should be thankful to us. But instead you steal? How dare you! Honey! I'm sure you sold everything at school. Is it really you? Tell us now or you'll be kicked out in the morning. No. It's really not me.. What's the use of raising these children when we're betrayed like this? Honey, go inside. I don't believe this... The rest of you can go, too. You have until tonight, okay? Okay. Good night. Go to sleep. I didn't fucking steal anything. Love does not rejoice at wrongdoing but finds its joy in the truth. It is always ready to make allowances, to trust, to hope and to endure whatever comes. The Word of the Lord. Amen. The body of Christ. Amen. - The body of Christ. - Amen. Beomtae. Dad... what are you doing here? What do you mean? I came to see my son. Why do you look so skinny? I told them to feed you well. Did they? Why didn't you just call me? Let's go. I should go and greet them. No, you don't have to. Yeongjae, go on in. Don't tell them my dad came. So you're Yeongjae! Beomtae told me a lot about you. He's bad-tempered like me so he doesn't have many friends. Will you stand by him? Stop it. Let's go. Look after Beomtae, will you? Let's eat out next time. Thanks, bye. Go on in. Wasn't that Beomtae's father? Yes. He must have come for Beomtae. He could've at least come in... What did he say? Nothing much. He had something to tell Beomtae. - Guests will come. Clean the floor. - Okay. Hey Did he go? Why? What? What did he say? None of your business. Something going on at home? The guests are here. Where are you going? Morning class duty. Go back to sleep. Move, make some room. This had a shitty sole. You piece of shit! It was fine when I sold it. Bullshit, that's why I bought it. But it fucked up after a few tryouts. Give me a refund or a new one. I can't give you a new one. Even stores don't do that. - You could've worn them out. - So you won't give me new ones? Sorry. Then fuck, I'll report you. What's faster? Telling the police or a teacher? Kids like you are known to have sticky fingers. What do you prefer? - How much do you want? - $150 That's it, Yeongjae. No need to be shamed if you'd been like this in the first place. Thanks. Tell me if you have any problems. And don't tell the teachers. Hello? - Father. - John. It's okay now that we've recovered all of the money. But the provost is very upset that the holy sanctuary was robbed. Isaac's Home is of our diocese. I'll put in a good word for you. We're sorry, Father. You little thief! Stand still! Pack your stuff. Son of a bitch! Go in and help him pack. Yes. Ungrateful brat. Let's go in. Why? Why? What? Why did you? You won't even listen. I'll listen so tell me. My dad promised to take me home, but he can't. My step-mom doesn't know about me. You've sucked up to them, so you're okay. But I have no place to go. Why don't you talk to Mom? Like she'll listen. She wants me out as soon as possible. Still... What about my situation? What about me? A smart aleck like you should know better. Right, sorry. I'm so sorry. Why did you even ask if all you think about is yourself? Right, I forgot what kind of fucked up son of a bitch you are. I'm leaving just because I don't want to live like you. That was harsh. Good morning. When did Beomtae leave? I'm not sure. He left before I woke up. - Did he say anything last night? - No, I asked but he didn't talk much. Even a dog gives a farewell bark when it leaves. What's the use of feeding such pricks. Shit! - Go visit your family today. - What? Visit your family and see if you can go back. - Why? - What do you mean why? Old pricks should go back home. The cathedral and district office will be on our backs. We should stop receiving older assholes. But the priests won't... You can still attend Mass even if you leave. And frankly, I don't know. The priest and everybody else see you as a future priest. But I'm not sure if you're priest material or if you'll ever get into seminary. Do you understand? I'm being objective because I care. Go and see your parents. What are you doing? What's in today? Aren't you selling? - No, I'm not. - Then what's this? Next time. What's up with him? Beomtae, give me a call. Come back and beg for forgiveness. You have no place to stay. We're closing at ten. Hello. - Yeongjae? - Go back to sleep. Get back to sleep. Why are you here? Are you back for good? I told you when l left I'd never come back. - But you're here. - Not because I want to be. I'll go tomorrow. Go to sleep. Stay a bit longer. Dad is asleep. I know. I saw him sleeping. - Is he working? - No, he just goes to church. Not just one church but four or five. I go with him sometimes. Then how does he make a living? Mom worked but hurt her back. She's at auntie's now. - Dad sent her there to save money. - What did she do? She cooked for construction workers. That stupid son of a bitch... Can I visit your place? Dad says it's much better than here. ls that what he said? That crazy... Never say that again. Don't even think about it. Go to sleep! - Want some pajamas? - No, go to sleep. When did he come? After midnight. Did he tell you why he came? No, nothing. - Really? Nothing? - No. Don't ask about the place he's at. He won't say anything good. Okay? Okay. I can't even stretch out my legs. It's hard because I can't go out. What? Another church? I would be punished if I did that. I serve God in heaven and 'Seongsim Church' on earth. Of course. What about my kids' scholarships? What did you buy this for? Let's see how it tastes. So you came? Don't stop... Just eat. Just eat. - When are you going? - Right after I finish eating. - Mom isn't here. - I heard. Good going. - Why did you come? - Do you have a problem with it? No, I thought you came to take Minjae. I told you that's never going to happen. If only my legs were okay, I would earn some money. You're full of shit. - Are you leaving already? - Yeah. I got this from church. Buy some books. You like reading. - I don't need it. - Take it. Can I go see just once where you live? Don't you dare say that again. Fuck! Just try coming. I'm going. Dad, Yeongjae's leaving. Here. Did you buy these? Don't ask. I told you. They give you lots of good stuff. You check that place out. Do they also give out T-shirts? Bye. Yeongjae! Thank God you didn't go too far. Wait for me! Why are you in such a hurry? Wait. Why the fuck are you following me? Yeongjae! - What? - Let's go see Mom. I don't know when you'll be back. She missed you a lot. Not today. Let's go next time. Tomorrow is Sunday. You can tell them Mom is sick. I'm begging you. I haven't gone to her since she left. Dad wouldn't let me. It's not too far. Please... Enjoy it while you can. Want some more? Stop crying. They're eating. My poor little baby... Do they feed you well? Your husband toId me he sent Yeongjae abroad to study. - Damn that bastard. - Stop it! Don't worry. I'm doing well. I hurt my back badly. I wish I could take you out to buy something nice. It's okay. Don't bother. Mommy's really sorry. Stop it. I don't want to hear it. Auntie is still better than Mom. Eat as much as you want. You can't sleep? I just came out for water. Go back to sIeep. Why didn't you call? I couId have gone up to Seoul. You should go to the hospital. You can't cure it by just lying all day. Hospitals in Seoul are just too expensive. And listening to your dad wailing for money will give me cancer. It's okay. I'm comfortable here. Is the place you're staying okay? Way better... So I was wondering... Can you take Minjae with you? I don't know how long I'll stay here. I'm worried about him. I made it clear when I left that it had to stop with me. You and Dad are just the same. Why don't you guys take on some responsibility? - That's not it. - Say I take Minjae with me. With both of us there I'm sure you two will separate. Then where do we go back? Who will be responsible for me? And what about Minjae? Do I take care of him? Why? What did I do to deserve this? No, that's not it... You're just the same. I'm going to bed. Help parents enjoy peaceful days with their children. For parents who have left this world, give them eternal rest in your kingdom. Let us pray for our local community. Dear Lord of joy... - Did you go home? - Yes. - Why are you back so soon? - It was too painful. Help us nurture a community full of love and joy. Let us pray for the younger generation. Lord of truth, we pray for the confused youth... What did they say at home? - Nothing much. - Your father? My family's situation has gotten worse. My father is sick in bed. My mother isn't even at home. - It's gotten worse? - Yes. You know we love you, right? You've been such a good boy. But we're in a difficult situation. Mom, Dad I'll become a priest for sure and repay your kindness. I want to go to college and live decently. But going back will change everything. Is that a threat? No, that's not it... Okay, we'll talk with the priest. Be extra good at the cathedral. - Get it? - Yes. Honey, get out. Hey. Why are you so startled? That hurts. 'Cause I didn't expect you here. - Why are you here? - What? We shared the same room for years and you didn't miss me? Of course, I missed you. How have you been? I texted you but you didn't reply. Can we talk? It'll only be minute. - I have to go to school. - Just for a second, okay? So you're doing good? Yeah. Yeongjae, I have a favor to ask. They adore you and listen to you. Persuade them so I can go back. It'll only be for a while. If you put in a good word for me, it'll be easier for me to talk to them. Help me out. I would like to help... but sorry. Why not? You really don't know why? Or are you pretending not to know? What do you mean? What nerve... I might get kicked out because of you. I'm hanging on with all I've got because of you. You want me to help you? Can you take care of me? - Son of a bitch - Fuck you. You're on your own now. I can't help you, dickhead. I'm going. Don't come asking me for help anymore. You are the green fruit on a branch reaching over a wall... You are the love of God, the beautiful love of God. I will pray for you and bless you. You are the gift of God, the lovely fruit of God. The blossoming tree in His arms. Father Yeongjae... Right, John I heard you visited your parents? Are they well? Yes. Father, did Mom... the director say something to you? To me? Yes, I saw her talking to you during Mass. It was about the cathedral's donation. Why? Did you do something wrong? No. John. Do you really want to be a priest? You can be frank with me. - Yes, I'm not lying. - I know you're not lying. I just wanted to make sure you weren't pressured by the director. If you're not sure, you can always go back home. No, I can't go back home. Nobody cares for me at home. I'll run away from home, meet bad friends, and get myself into trouble. I'll spend the rest of my life out in the streets. Is that what you want? - No, of course not. - Please help me. I have to become a priest. A great priest like you... Please help me. Okay. I trust you'll help me. Thank you. Good-bye. Yeongjae! This is Yeongjae... no, John. I always get confused. So you're John. I heard a lot about you. Is John your real name? No, it's Yeongjae but everybody calls me John. You must be full of the Spirit. Nice to meet you. My name is Yunmi. She volunteered to teach and the director recommended you. Attending Mass isn't enough. You must also study hard. - Do you understand? - Yes. Let's study two times a week. Concentrate on studying but not her, okay? It's just like an ordinary house. Things have improved much. Children are reluctant to stay at a place with a facility sign. If this was a registered facility, we can receive more support. But we choose not to for the children. You are very devoted. I heard a seminary student from our diocese has been long-awaited. The whole congregation and the provost have high hopes for Yeongjae. Can vocational school students also enter seminaries? He's not even a high-ranking student. That's why I asked her to help him out. She overcame similar hardships so she'll understand him well. She may not be cute but she goes to Seoul University. Father, guys line up for me at school! See, lying is the greatest sin. This seems okay. Take a look. - This is a bit... - Is it too hard? Try this one. Come on in. I bet you've never been to such a place. No. My mom worked hard to open this place but only cab drivers come to eat. Who would want to eat in such a dark place? What did you just say? We have plenty of customers. How was your tuition paid? Do you think I dug up some oil? Well, who's this handsome guy? Dating younger guys, following the trend? No, he's just a high school student. Really? He's a baby then. Hello. I told you about my new student. He's Yeongjae but they call him John at home. Do you guys always have to use nicknames? No, it's my baptismal name. Go to Mass or put down the cross you have up. Mass doesn't give me money or food. - They only give you tiny rice cakes. - They're not rice cakes. What do you know? Funny, huh? What should I serve our baby? He's not a baby. Leave him alone. - Am I bothering you? - No. Eat as much as you want. Don't hesitate to come and eat anytime. You're welcome every day. One good meal can change everything. - Thank you. - How polite! With only girls in the family I'd love to adopt a son like you. Stop making him uncomfortable. Go finish the dishes. Just look how she talks! You go and finish them. Why should I? I'm a customer. Oh, is that so? Thanks for coming, Miss. Just try not to pay. You are upset because I didn't serve you? Here, eat up! I'm fine. Give it to him. Yeongjae. You... Come here. How did you find me? Dad told me. I said not to come near this place. He told me to give this to you and check out the place. I didn't want to come but you know how stubborn he is. You're driving me crazy. It's not as good as it seems. All we have is something thrown away by rich people. Okay, I won't come back. I'm sorry. I was curious but I wasn't dying to come and see. No matter how bad it is, I live with Mom and Dad. But you're here alone. I won't ever come again. You're driving me nuts. Did you eat? Wait. No, I have money. Shut up and take it. Don't be an idiot and tell Dad. Here. Thanks, bye! I'm back. - You're late. - We went to many bookstores. - You should have called. - I'm sorry. What about the workbook? You might be able to fool the priest and my wife but you can't fool me. You're the same as any other child. In fact you could be even worse. I'll be watching you. - Has Beomtae called you? - No. - I heard he was roaming about. - Really? If he gets in trouble again the district office will pick on you, too. Go to bed. 'Thank you for breakfast' Before and after meals, thank them in a big voice, okay? Any of you seen Beomtae? Tell me who's seen Beomtae. What did he say? Don't even talk to him, okay? Okay. You don't know what he'll do. If he comes back, it'll be trouble for us. - Got it? - Okay. Now eat. I knew you were a sly little fox and a shitty son of a bitch. Beomtae, listen to me... You knew it wasn't me all along. You're such an asshole. - I knew you weren't my friend but... - That's not it. The director... no, Dad would be devastated if he knew about his faithful son's betrayal. - Dad! - Hey, Beomtae. Please, just this once. This was going to be my last time. l really needed money today. I'm so sorry. I'll do whatever you want. Just help me out this once. You shouldn't repent to me but to God you solemnly serve. Then help me return here. I don't care how you persuade the director. Get me back home by tomorrow and I'll keep this secret until I die. Okay, I'll talk to them after school. I'll make sure you can return. I'll ask them to forgive you saying you're out in the cold alone. Wait. Go to an internet cafe or somewhere. You sure know how to talk. You'll survive anywhere, you sly little fox. See you tomorrow at home. See you! ...great significance in forming a modern political and social system by limiting the authority of the monarchy... Hello? Is this the police? Someone is trying to break into a car. It's 47-8 Anyang-dong. No, he looks like a runaway boy. It's not my car. He's in a parking lot. Hurry up. Yes... I'm home. Father, this is for you. - Thanks. - You're welcome. I said don't hang around with Beomtae. We didn't. What did he say? What the fuck did he say? He said nothing. He was coming home today. Don't tell Mom and Dad you met him, okay? I saw you going around breaking into cars. Be careful unless you want to end up like him. Okay. This is the Song of Solomon. On my bed at night I sought my sweetheart. I sought but could not find him. I came upon watchmen those who go on their rounds in the city. ''Have you seen my sweetheart?'' Barely had I passed them when I found my sweetheart. The Word of the Lord. - Thanks be to God. - Thanks be to God. Yeongjae! Your father is here. You said he was sick. - What? - Come out. What is this in the middle of the night... My precious son! My son is up! What are you doing? I've come to see my son. This is crazy. You shouldn't come here at this hour. I'm sorry, I'll get a cab for him. Wait. Did you have anything to tell me? I'm so ashamed of myself. I should be able to take care of my own children. Mr. Director... Can I call you my big brother? Dad, please! Call me as you wish but hurry up. The kids might wake up. All I want to say is that... you don't have any kids... No, I forgot. You have too many. I was such a moron to have two boys. Now they're miserable because of me. And my wife lives on alcohol. I can't take it anymore. If only my legs were good I would work for my boys. - Why drink when you're so sick? - Because I'm so frustrated. I drank because I was so upset and angry. I shouldn't be saying this. And I'm really sorry... But can I send my younger son here? There's nobody to take care of him... Wait, let go. I'm not finished. Let's go. - Let's go. - I have something to tell him. I'm sorry, I'll take him home. Let's go! Please go back home today. Let's talk when you're sober. No, you need to hear me out. Fuck! Let go of me! Stop it! Please.. Let's go. Take a taxi. Don't worry, the bus will come. - Take a taxi 'cause you're drunk! - I don't have the money! I'm good on my own. Go back. Dad... Please, don't be like this. I'm begging you. Or get me on insurance and cut off my fingers or poison my milk or something. Please, just kill me! I'm sorry. Still... Don't hate your mother. You shouldn't do that. I don't hate her. You're the only person I hate. I totally deserve it. - Still, try to understand me... - Shut up! Just take a taxi home! Please take Minjae with you. Dad! It's hard enough by myself. You're so damn selfish. Leaving him with me to enjoy your own life? No, that's not it. Without Minjae at home, I can't go back. What? You're coming back home? Dad! Take a taxi or walk home. I don't care. Just try coming here again if you want to see me go crazy. Yeongjae. You said your father was sick in bed. I'm sorry. If this continues, we can't keep you here. - I understand. - l want no more trouble. Today everything is on sale. Any questions? - Is this the new model? - You bet. Catholic High Schools Nationwide Yeongjae. Hi. Why are you out? It's cold. You're early. My class ended early. What's up? I wanted to give you this. What's this? I wanted to thank you for helping me. Really? Thanks. I feel like I'm taking candy from a child. Why not buy something for yourself? There's nothing I want for myself. Well, in fact, I need to ask you a favor. I knew it. So this is a bribe? What is it? Could you talk to Dad, I mean the director for me? Tell him I've improved and I can make it into seminary school. There's a boarding prep school for priesthood. If I can only get in I won't have to deal with the director. - Can you do this for me? - Yeongjae. Yes? Don't worry. I know what you mean. But I hope you're not fooling yourself. I hope you can live according to your words. You know what I mean? Can you promise? - Yes, I promise. - Okay. Let's go in. - Hello. - I'm back. I'm sorry but can you take him into his room? Yeongjae. - Dad, get up. - Sit over here. Get up if you don't want to see me going crazy! John, that's so rude! You're called John here. That's a good name. - Get up! - Yeongjae! Get up! What are you doing? Go to your room! - Dad, these people must go. - These people? Listen to him talk! - Why don't you grow up? - Dad? I've grown up way too soon because of you. Get up! Yeongjae! What about Minjae's school? I heard nearby schools were good. An academic school for Minjae 'cause he's going to college. - Yeongjae! - John! What are you doing? Put that knife down! You bastard! Put it down! Sorry, Dad... But please send him away. Or I'll... He used to threaten us with scissors - at his throat as a child. - Stop the bullshit and leave! Yeongjae! Yeongjae, put it down and let's go outside. - You, son of a bitch! - Dad! Please step outside. Please! What the fuck are you doing! We're leaving so stop. - I'm sorry. - You're bleeding. Stop it. Sorry for causing such trouble. Dad, let's go. He's bleeding too much. - John, your father's leaving. - Go away! - Son of a bitch. - Please! - You're no longer my son. - Let's just go! Don't ever come here again! Yeongjae! Dad... it's all my fault. I won't ever do that again. Please forgive me. Dad... I'll go to Mass more and study harder. I'll pay you back. PIease forgive me this once. PIease forgive me this once. You know how grateful I am. Please give me one more chance. I'll never do that again. Forgive me. Let me see. Please forgive me.. Things like that can happen. You didn't mean to do that, did you? - Where is he going? - Jacob's Home in Miryang. It's in the country but it's new and the air is clean. I put in a good word for you so take care. - Call me once in a while. - Call me, too. I will. Let's get going. What's all the fuss. Don't give up on your dream. Study hard and go to Mass. God will guide you through everything. - Good-bye. - Let's go. Wherever you go, just remember there are more people in worse situations. You'll do well if you remember that. I will. I'm sorry Dad, can I stop by somewhere? You don't have to call me Dad. You'll soon have a new Dad. Yeongjae.. - Were you in class? - Yes. I came to give you this. What is it? Some clothes and shoes that I've outgrown. Thanks. I won't tell Dad because then he won't buy me any clothes. Okay. These are good as new. But why now? Going somewhere? No, I sorted out my old stuff. Sorry. That'll never happen again. I made sure Dad would never do that again. I should have stopped him from going then. I'm really sorry. Dad also said he'll never go there again. So don't worry about us. When we grow up, let's make a lot of money. And let's live together. Stop crying. You look like a sissy. Go back into class. I have to go now. Where's your school uniform? Don't ask. I'll call you. Take care. We can go now.
