(dramatic music) - [Announcer] You are watching the news network the news waits for, TNN Total Network News. Once again, TNN cameras and correspondence converge on a Capitol coverup to bring you a special report. Mastergate. All eyes turn to Washington DC, where rumor and scandal take center stage in the nation's political arena. Now, from TNN headquarters in Savannah, here is anchorman Chip Chatworth. - Welcome to TNN' gavel to gavel live coverage of the long awaited start of these hearings of the joint House and Senate Select Committee to investigate alleged covert arms assistance to alleged other Americans. Reporting for Total Network News from the Sherman Adams Room in the John Mitchell building in Washington, DC is TNN's Merry Chase, Merry. - There's a great deal of milling about in the hearing room, Chip. - Milling seems to be right on schedule, Merry. Is there any sense that the committee might not be getting off this morning as planned? - There's been a last minute reshuffling of some of the witnesses, and of course, the obligatory bomb threat or two. But I've been told by a committee staffer that there will be no further delays of the kind that have dogged these investigations for so long, Chip, that nothing can stop these hearings now. - With us too, for TNN is a man whose beat has included the invasions of Grenada, Panama, and Kuwait, the Berlin Wall coming down, and the Columbia space shuttle going up. To give us his insights on the hearings in Washington, here's TNN Senior Correspondent Clay Fielder, direct from his vantage point in Damascus. - Chip, Committee chairman, Senator Bowman is just making his way in to take his place on the panel. We should be getting started any minute now. - A reminder to our viewers that after each day's questioning of witnesses before his committee, Senator Bowman will answer your live phone-in questions here on TNN's special program, "The Chair in the Hot Seat." Merry? (gavel banging) - [Merry] Here's Senator Bowman. - Can we have it quiet, please? (gavel banging) I'd like to begin on time if we may, in as much as we are late already. (gavel banging) Thank you. Thank you very much. Even though a few members of the committee have not been able to get away from a roll call vote on the floor of the House, I am advised that since enough of us are not all there, we can proceed with these proceedings here, proceedings which have submerged to the surface after years of stonewalling and coverup. I'd like, if I may, to begin by presenting a preamble I prepared for the purpose of broadly narrowing down the scope of what these hearings hope to accomplish. If we, as a nation, have learned anything from Water, Iran-Contra, and Iraqgates it is that those who forget the past, are certain to be subpoenaed. Hence, the formation of this permanent select joint committee which I share the co-privilege of occupying the chair of with my distinguished colleague, one of my oldest and longest friends, the Honorable Oral Proctor of the House of Representatives, and which was charged by the President of the United States with conducting an exhausting inquiry into one of the more recent examples of debilitating governmental self abuse, which has become known throughout the media as Mastergate. This panel, which intends to give every appearance of being bi-partisan, will be ever mindful of the president's instructions to dig down as far as we can, no matter how high up that might take us. Now, let me infantasize one thing at the start. This is not a witch hunt. It is not a trial. We are not looking for hides to skin, or goats to scape. We are just trying, at long last, to gather all the facts together into one room in the hope that they might somehow recognize one another. Our chief goal of course, is to answer the question. What did the president know? And does he have any idea that he knew it? Committee will call its first witness, Mr. Stuart Butler. - [Merry] Stuart Butler was a key player in the earliest phases of the Mastergate affair. A young man once thought to have a very bright future in government, he has since enjoyed an almost meteoric disappearance. He is currently handling blanket appeals for the Bureau of Indian affairs. - Mr. Butler, do you swear the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? - He does. - He has to. - And I do too, sir. - [Archer] Will the witness please give his name for the record? - His name is Stuart Butler, sir. - And you are yourself are who, sir? - My name is Foster Child, Mr. Chairman. I am with the law firm of Friar Pastor, Priest, and Pope. - And I'd remind you, Mr. Child that Mr. Butler is a witness, not a conduit. We are not pressing his buttons so we can hear you ring, sir. (crowd murmuring) Mr. Hunter, are you ready to begin the questioning? - Yes sir. - [Archer] You may start to begin then, if you would. - Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Mr. Butler. - Good morning. - [Merry] This is Shepard Hunter, Chief General Council for the Combined Permanent Select Committee. - As you know, I'm Chief General Counsel for the Combined Permanent Select Committee. And in that role, you and I have spent many many hours in earlier preliminary hearings, during which you were interrogated by staff members of the members of this committee, and subsequently sub-questioned by sub-staff members of the permanent committee's temporary sub committee. - I believe I know that, yes sir. - None of my questions, therefore, should come as any great surprise? - No, sir. - Nor any of your answers. - I can only hope. - Mr. Butler you were, during the period of time in question, employed by the Department of Justice were you not? - Yes sir. - Would I also be correct in saying that that position that you held is one that you no longer do? - Yes you would. In that no, I don't. - [Shepherd] You were dismissed by the Justice Department? - I am on a permanent leave of absence, yes sir. - Well, you were fired. Is that what you're saying? - It's my guest that I am, yes sir. (gavel banging) - And prior to that occurrence, can you tell us what your title was during the series of past events, the accumulative effect of which lead us up to the present time? - I was, in respect to answering that question, acting as Assistant to the Acting Assistant Deputy Attorney General. - And in respect to that capacity, I ask you to direct your remarks to a meeting that took place in the Assistant Attorney General's office on the afternoon of February 25th of that year. - That would be immediately following the 24th? - To the day, yes. For the purposes of specificity, I refer you to page 285, binder B, section seven, subparagraph six, big A, little D, which contains your name as being listed among one of those who attended that particular meeting. - I see my name. yes sir. - We can therefore assume that you attended. - Not necessarily, sir, - Mr. Buttler, either you did or you didn't. - Or I didn't, though I did. - Mr. Hunter, if I could perhaps help to avoid a respondatorial redundancy, although Mr. Butler's name does, without question, appear in the meetings minutes, he did not in fact spend one minute in the meeting. - Mr. Butler, can you tell the committee how you happened to be there in as much as you weren't? - Yes sir. Due to the ongoing upheavalment of justice during that period, a great many of us in the department had to be a great many different places. Very often, at the same time. I was unable to attend the meeting that took place during the period of your question. Since by then, I was assigned to overlook the work of Assistant Attorney General Cleaver, who suddenly found himself out of the loop during that particular timeframe. - [Archer] On the day of the meeting? - If that's what I said, yes. - Doing what exactly, was the Assistant Attorney General doing, can you tell us? - I believe I'm about to tell you that, yes sir. Mr. Cleaver was giving testimony that day. - And the Assistant Attorney General was giving testimony regarding what exactly was he? - Regarding the Special Prosecutor's efforts to indict the Acting Attorney General for conflict of interest in pardoning the Former Attorney General who was convicted of conspiracy charges he had inadvertently filed against himself, but which later proved to be quite damaging. - I's like to return to this meeting on the 25th. - Yes sir. - [Archer] The one you didn't attend. - Along with the others. - Who did? - Who didn't. There was mostly no one there who actually was. - Nevertheless, you do know who the subject of that particular meeting was, do you not? - I do. - The subject was Mr. Victor Gamble, was it not? - It was. - Mr. Butler. I would like you to walk us through that talk, Mr. Butler, zooming in, in particular, on Mr. Victor Gamble the man himself. He was an international financier, was he not? With financial interests on a international scale. - That is a spectrum of his range, yes sir. Not surprisingly, while Mr. Gamble was originally born in American, he only spends depreciable amounts of time in this country, preferring to operate out of Lichtenstein through an offshore Libyan corporation which is based in The Bahamas, while for purposes of domicility, he resides in Switzerland in a consecutive series of unnumber of houses. - He is for all intensive purposes, a tax fugitive. - That is my conviction sir, based on several of his own. - Mr. Butler, can you tell the committee how much money Victor Gamble owed the United States Government at the period of time in question? Pretty well up in nosebleed country, was it not? - To the best of whatever it was I knew, yes sir. - $200 million, was it not? - That's ballpark enough, yes sir. - Those would have been back taxes? - Yes. Plus interest on those and other similar arrears he was behind on, plus fines, penalties, as well as court costs on his previous convictions for fraud, evasion, attempted bribery of federal officials, and several counts of perjury. - Victor Gamble had, more or less, put himself beyond the reach of the law, had he not? - He had not been in the United States since the Chamber of Commerce had voted him man of the Year. - Efforts had been made to make Mr. Gamble make good, yes? - In March of that particular year, the same year in which the previous February occurred, Mr. Gamble was ordered to comply with a federal court order ordering him to surrender certain audits and financial statements. Since his compliance was of the non variety, we then obtained a second court order ordering that for everyday Mr. Gamble withheld what the first court order ordered, he would be fine in the order of $100,000. - $100,000 per day? (gavel banging) - I know it takes some government people weeks to make that kind of money, sir. But since Mr. Gamble holds among other things, a Colombian passport, he was able to take advantage of the fact that in that country a criminal penalty is deductible as an operating expense - And his response was? - Nil to none, sir. When the tab reached eight million three, the penny finally dropped, that Mr. Gamble was not only not gonna surrender his records, but that he was gonna stone wall us in the penalty payments. And it was time to take some decisive steps. And will you tell the committee what those steps were which you undertook to take? - Yes sir. Considering Mr. Gamble's diversification of interests ranged from mills to malls, with holdings in everything from aero to office space, the decision decided upon was to confiscate one of Mr. Gamble's holdings to pay a portion, any part thereof of what he owed the US Government. - Which choice became what? - Given its pick of all of Mr. Gamble's various goodies, as we like to call them, the best optionary move seemed to be the takeover of MPI. - MPI being Master Pictures, Incorporated, the motion picture company owned by Victor Gamble. - Yes sir. Master Pictures Incorporated. - You were part of the process, the end result of which was that the federal bureaucracy took over the ownership and running of a motion picture company, is that correct? - Yes sir. - Thank you. I have no use for the witness at this time, Mr. Chairman. - Thank you, Mr. Hunter. Mr. Proctor, do you wish to question the witness? - Yes, Mr. Chairman. Just briefly I do. I don't intend to take up any more time than I will. - My learned colleague rarely does. - Congressman Oral Proctor, as sharp today as he was when he entered the House, 30 terms ago. - I just have one or two of my own questions, which I don't quite understand Mr. Butler. - Sir? - Was it the consensus of this idea, sir, The crux of your thrust that that by taking over a movie company our government would become active in the production of motion pictures, in the same way I shall resay for the purpose of saying, a certain former Soviet Union of the USSR? - As I have repeatedly reiterated, the Master Pictures take over is prompted by Mr. Gamble being in very deep yogurt with various of the federal branches. The game plan, as I understood the broad strokes, was to separate out all of MPI's different assets. and for the government to benefit from the sale of them all. - Yet, out of all the items listed herein, the government went ahead and got rid of a total of exactly none? - No more than that, no sir. - In other words, although the powers that were had zeroed in one course of action, they then promptly did a 360 and did something completely other? - Sir, with all due respect and in my deepest opinion, because of all the confusion and chaos at the time of this period, it was decided to bump the entire MPI business out of our department, with the understanding that the matter would no longer have anything whatsoever to do with justice. - [Oral] By order of whom then was this matter passed on? - I don't know for a fact sir. I only heard it said it's hearsay. - Mr. Butler, it ill behooves you to with old information from this committee, some of whom hold you in enough contempt as it is. Now, whose name did you exactly here? - It's Mr. Slaughter, sir. - I beg your pardon? - It was Mr. Slaughter, sir. - Mr. Wiley Slaughter, the former director of the CIA? (crowd murmuring) - Yes sir. (gavel banging) - Mr. Proctor. - Mr. Butler, please elucidate us in your inferal, regarding Mr. Slaughter's involvement if you will. - I'm not saying there was any involvement involved, sir. I'm just saying I heard his name come up at a meeting, I may not even have attended. - Mr. Chairman, I'm afraid I know as much as I ever will. I have no further questions. If the witness has no further answers, I will yield whatever balance I may have left. - Thank you, Mr. Proctor. - Thank you, Mr. Chairman. - Mr. Butler, on behalf of the entire committee I want to thank you for your largely cooperative appearance here this morning. We're especially grateful, knowing how time consuming it is for you a the present time, being uncooperative as you are with the House Ethics Committee, where you are presently charged with influence pedaling, and obstructing justice. - Thank you, sir. - The committee will stand in recess for 10 minutes, and resume again in one hour. (fast paced music) - And so the committee, having disposed of its first witness, rolled up it's sleeves and dug in hard. Merry Chase, would you agree? - Rolled up its sleeves, and waded right in indeed, Chip. Laying, if not the blame, then certainly the responsibility for the start of Mastergate squarely at the feet of the former head of the CIA, Wiley Slaughter. - For his impression so far, let's go now to Cairo Egypt, for Total Network News's Clay Fielder. - Clay. - Merry. - Clay? - Chip. - Clay, you've covered Watergate, the ongoing Iran-Contra and Iraqi flaps, the Agnew mess, the McCarthy hearings, the Pentagon payoffs, the Knob Digger and Deaver trials, The Reagan court testimony, the HUD, SNL, and BCCI scandals, The Navy's Tailhook Sex Scandal, Tower, Meese, Wright, Wettech, Bork, Bitburg, Ginsburg and Weinberger, the Keating Five, the House Check Bouncing and Post Office Affair, The Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill, Long John Dong, and Pubic Coke Can testimony. From where you sit has Washington, where you to opinionate, finally struck the absolutely rock bottom of the barrel with a CIA takeover of a Hollywood studio, sleaze wise speaking? Will the president himself be implicated, do you think, in light of his persistent denials that he is telling the truth? And what about the totally surprising, but not wholly unexpected revelation that Wiley Slaughter's name has finally surfaced as one more finger in the pie? Your reactions so far Clay, and just the way you see them. - Chip, the committee is resuming quicker than expected. - Thank you, Merry. And thank you, Clay. And now it's back to the hearing room, and Senator Bowman's, and the committee's next witness. (gavel banging) - [Merry] Abel Lamb has been in government service for eight years, and testifying for nine. - The witness will raise his right hand please. Do you swear the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? - Mr. Chairmen, the witness would like to say something before he says anything at all, sir. - The witness will first be sworn, and then we'll have a name for the record. - Now following that, I would hope he would be permitted, sir. - [Archer] Anything that follows will come after it. Does the witness so swear? - I do. - [Archer] The eye, in your case being? - My name is Abel Lamb, Mr. Chairman. - If Mr. Lamb could read his statement at this time, sir? - Council will identify himself to the committee. - My name is Nat Picker, Mr. Chairman with the Manhattan law firm of Block, Stall, Wild, and Wilder. - You may have read your statement, Mr. Lamb. - Yes sir, thank you. - We will take Mr. Pickers word for it that it's a brief one, remembering that brevity is in the ear of the beholder. - I wish,' first of all, to extend my extreme gratitude to the committee for the privilege of being subpoenaed, and being granted limited immunity. In that, that gives me the leeway to tell everything I know without having to tell everything I know. It has been most difficult remaining silent during all I've said up to now. In lieu of the fact that I felt it my duty to remain steadfastly evasive, and selectively honest so as to protect the national interest, and above all, to safeguard the president's security. Looking back in hindsight, there are many things I would have done differently in the past. But that I did whatever I did was because I felt I was doing my best acting in the interest of our government. I also asked the committee to remember that, ethics and morality aside, I felt I had a higher obligation to do whatever I was ordered to. I'm aware that that's not an alibi, but I know you'll agree it is an excuse. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. - [Archer] Thank you, Mr. Lamb. - Mr. Hunter? - Mr. Lamb also has a closing statement he'd like to make, sir. - Let's see if we can't just squeeze a few questions in between statement, shall we? Mr. Hunter? - [Shepherd] Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Lamb. - Mr. Hunter. - [Shepherd] You're employed by the IRS? - I am. - The Internal Revenue Service? - That IRS, yes sir. - Please fill the committee in, by way of your professional background, if you will. - I was first employed by the Delaware accounting firm of Partridge and Crow, where I was appointed executor of the then Secretary of Treasury Crow's Blind Trust, a responsibility I held right up until the time of the secretary's trial. Following his sentencing, and Mr. Partridge's his appointment to replace him, I came on board with the IRS, where I've served for the last four years, while Mr. Crow has been serving his five to 10. - One of which years, you spend on assignment in Hollywood California, is that not correct? - It is more correct than not, yes sir. - Upon acceptance of your assignment, what precisely did you expect your duties in California out there would entail? - I assume that liquidating all of MPIs assets would be the sum of my entire entailment. - Can you tell the committee how it happened that not one of the inventoried items belonging to MPI was ever, nor to the present day in time up to now, has still not ever been liquidated? - There was a change in the game plan. If you think of the initial meeting of February 25th as our scrimmage, then the government's plan to sell our various parts of MPI can be seen as a decision to punt. But instead of punting, I was sent out to California for a long pass, so to speak, this switch in tactics occurring when I was summoned to a second smaller meeting on the night following the day of the first previous meeting. - And how many people who were present were at that meeting? - If you include me, there were two, sir. - There was one other person. - Besides the one me, yes sir. - You and someone else? - I got the figure by crunching the two numbers, sir. - And in the person of whom, would that other person have been>? - We're speaking of names? - With any luck at all. - The other person was Mr. Wiley's Slaughter. (crowd murmuring) (gavel banging) - You must been somewhat surprised to receive an invitation from the then director of the CIA, were you not? - Somewhat and then some, yes sir. - [Archer] Had you ever imagined that Mr. Slaughter was even aware of your existence? - Only to the extent that Mr. Slaughter was aware of everyone in Washington's existence. - And yet here he was inviting you, a considerably low echelon player. - The lowest, yes sir. - Inviting you to meet with him. - No sir. - [Archer] You just said that he did. - He did sir, but not to a meeting. - [Archer] To a discussion then. - A non-discussion to be perfectly accurate, sir. - Can you explain the distinction? - A non-discussion is one in which the participants involved agree that although they are in reality having a discussion, for the purpose of future, and probable deniability, they will maintain that no discussion, in point of fact, ever took place. Such an agreement must, of course, be non-discussed beforehand. - I see. Can you tell us, Mr. Lamb in what manner you received Mr. Slaughter's invitation to this discussion, non or otherwise, that took place? Did it come through routine government channels? - Somewhat other, sir. - What sort of other would that somewhat have been? - I got it from a waiter, in a restaurant at the end of a meal. - Was it on official stationery of any kind? - Not actually, no. - Actually, on what was it then? - It was in a fortune cookie. (audience laughing) (gavel banging) - [Archer] Inside a fortune cookie, Mr. Lamb? - Yes sir. - Was it just rolled up in there? - Folded in half. - And it was just assumed that you would open it? - The waiter leaned down and said the fortune cookies are especially good tonight, sir. - You must have thought that was somewhat unusual, a message of that importance inside a fortune cookie. - And being in an Italian restaurant at the time. (audience laughing) (gavel banging) Actually, I had intended going to a Chinese restaurant that night. My wife and I only changed our minds at the last minute. - And you informed Mr. Slaughter of his change of plans? - This time in time I had never either spoken to, nor with Mr. Slaughter. - And yet he knew where you were gonna be? - Mr. Slaughter knows things about people sometimes even before they know them themselves, if in fact they ever do, should Mr. Slaughter feel it would be best if they never did. - This meeting on the 26th, the one that never took place, took place where? - At Mr. Slaughter's bedside. - At the time you didn't see each other, Mr. Slaughter was in the Bethesda Naval hospital? He was a patient there, isn't that true? - He was in a gown, lying in a bed. That's what came up on my screen. - According to TV and press reports of the period, Mr. Slaughter had checked in extensively to undergo some routine medical tests. - I was led to misunderstand that as well, yes sir. - Can you describe Mr. Slaughter's condition upon non-seeing him at the time of your visit at the hospital? - Yes sir. The minute I walked into his room, I was grateful in a way that I wasn't really there. Mr. Slaughter's face was all horribly twisted. Only not in the way we usually know it. He was in a tremendous amount of pain. But his orders were that he'd be given no drugs, preferring unbearable suffering to losing control, or to having anyone happen tap into that portion of his brain that was for his eyes only. Also there was this lifelong fear of any drug which might have caused him to have to tell the truth during any conversation. - Was he a coherent when you spoke to him? - I understood everything he said, once I heard it. - Hearing him talk was a problem? - [Abel] In a matter of speaking. - Why was that? Did he have difficulty projecting? Was he weak? - Mrs. Slaughter was hooked up to a number of life support systems, one of which caused every word he said to be delayed by several seconds, allowing the device to instantly scan his memory bank, a copy of which was stored at the CIA to be certain that whatever he uttered could be cleared for communication. - So you didn't actually hear Mr. Slaughter the moment that he spoke? - Not at that precise moment, no sir. There would be short blast of muzak in between. "I've got the world on a string", some movie themes, Barry Manilow, that sort of thing. (bell dings) - Can you tell the committee precisely what Mr. Slaughter's- - I'm sorry, Mr. Hunter. I'm afraid I haven't been watching the time, all of which of yours seems to have been used up. - Thank you, Mr. Lamb. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. - Congressman Byers, I expect would like to ask the witness some questions of your own. - Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Lamb. - Congressman Byers, a two termer from New Jersey on a rare visit to Washington between junkets to investigate the wasting of government funds. - I'd like for you to get into the content of what actually was said during your so-called non-meeting with Mr. Slaughter. - I was informed by Mr. Slaughter that as of that moment forward, I was to act solely upon his orders. - His orders only? The director of the CIA told you on the QT in an ICU that you would have been no longer answerable to the IRS? - [Abel] Yes sir. - And he said he had the power to control anyone in an appointed or elected position. And they were to ignore all previous oaths, to be loyal only to him? - Yes sir, he did. - You seem like a nice young man, Mr. Lamb. - Yes sir, I do. - And you and your wife are expecting soon to be parents? - We are, sir. - How'd you feel about being told that you were to violate your vows, to go back on the trust expected of a public servant? - To be honest, it made me feel very uncomfortable. - [Clifton] Did you tell that to Mr. Slaughter? - I did. He said the precedent had felt the same way, at first anyway. (crowd murmuring) (gavel banging) - The president took orders from Mr. Slaughter? He explicitly implied that? Is that the impression you came away with? - No, sir. Mr. Slaughter had expanded my ignorance to exclude any independent impressions. - Just what was the CIA's interest in MPI? Did the director allow you to know that? - Master Pictures, at the time of the takeover, was involved in the production of several feature films. But there was one in particular that caught Mr. Slaughter's eye. - Mr. Slaughter was intimate with the studios production schedule? - Nothing escape Mr. Slaughter's attention. Even as he spoke that day, he was being fed secret intelligence intravenously. His orders were that I was to hold on to MPI, and that I would receive further instructions the next time we didn't meet again. - And this would be at Mr. Slaughter's bedside once more? - No sir. The next time he spoke to me Mr. Slaughter had already died. - Mr. Slaughter was dead? - [Abel] Yes sir, he was. (gavel banging) - He was medically dead? - Head to toe tag, yes sir. - My distinguished colleague will forgive my interrupting. - I would expect no less, Mr. Chairman. - I am most anxious to hear what took place in connection with the witness's non-discussion with the then non Mr. Slaughter. - I'd like to remind the chair, that the truth is sometimes stranger than fiction. - The chair needs no reminder of what a stranger truth is around here, sir. Continue on Mr. Lamb. - Well, upon arriving at the hospital, as having been previously instructed to, I was immediately informed that Mr. Slaughter had passed away as a result of dying. - [Archer] Where you told of what? - No, I wasn't. - And you didn't ask? - I'm not cleared to have that kind of curiosity, sir. The director had been kicked upstairs, was the way it was put to me. - By whom? Whom else was there? - Only Mr. Slaughter and members of the immediate agency. Nevertheless, I was informed that Mr. Slaughter still wanted to see me. Quite honestly, I couldn't help feeling honored that I was one of the first people Mr. Slaughter wanted to see, so soon after he passed away. - And just who was it informed you that the late Mr. Slaughter would be keeping his appointment with you? - It was Major Battle. - Major Manley Battle? - Yes sir, It was Major Manley Battle. (crowd murmuring) (gavel banging) - Would you know if Major Battle is assigned to the CIA, Mr. Lamb? - I believe that's one of the things I don't know anymore, sir. - Major Battle is in fact, a member of the staff of the NCS of the NSC, is he not? The National Council of Security for the National Security Council? - I believe so sir, as best I can still understand anything at all anymore. - And yet you say Major Battle was your contact and connection with this occasion? - He was, yes sir. - What happened then, after Major Battle informed you of Mr. Slaughter's promotion? - The major escorted me to Mr. Slaughter's room, sir, where the bed had been emptied of him. - And were you informed as to where the former director had been redirected? - What I understood, sir, was that Mr. Slaughter's remains were to be perpetually shifted from one grave to another. Because he had made so many countless enemies, throughout his lifelong dedication to impose democracy on helpless people everywhere, there were understandable fears that in the event of a conventional burial, Mr. Slaughter's body might be taken hostage by terrorists, and his family would never see him dead again. - Can you tell us how Mr. Slaughter communicated with you, given the loss of his voice, to say nothing of his life. - Electronically, sir. - The director had previously taped a video cassette for the purpose of updating me beyond his own expiration date, as well as answers to any questions that occurred to him, that he thought might occur to me. The essence of his message was that I was to take my orders from Major Battle during the time that Mr. Slaughter had scheduled to be dead, or his downtime as he put it. - Mr. Lamb, I'd like to ask you to study a copy of the document you have before you, which lists the number of events which you previously stated you do not recall remembering, but which you have remembered recalling- - We're gonna cut away a momentarily for a second here for a special briefing from the White House by Press Secretary Marvin Rottweiler. - Repeat that the statement just issued by the agency asserts that, whatever truth to the contrary, Wiley Slaughter enjoyed a peaceful death, and that in a private ceremony the Slaughter family followed the former CIA directors wish that his body be shredded. - And this just in as well. TNN has learned from CNN that after years of refusing to do so, Secretary of State Bishop has finally agreed to appear as a witness. This news is expected to reach the committee sometime later today. And now back to Chairman Bowman, who appears to be winding up his questioning of the initial witness in question. - Is there anything else you'd like to add to that statement Mr. Lamb, or any of the testimony you've given here today? - I've tried to make as complete abreast of everything as I could, Mr. Chairman. - The committee is grateful, Mr. Lamb. You provided us all over the perfect example of innocence led astray, of blind acceptance transformed into immoral mindlessness. - I owe my country no less, sir. - Thank you, Mr. Lamb. (gavel banging) - And so the eagerly hoped for, inexorable unraveling of Mastergate has at last begun to unfold. Right now waiting for the arrival of his appearance today, the highest ranking administration member the committee has yet to hope to hear from, Secretary of State Bishop, is TNN's own Merry Chase. Great anticipation over there, I would imagine. - Yes you would, Chip. - Any sight of the secretary yet? - He's just down the hall, Chip testifying before the house Curds and Weights Committee. - Let's use the time then to get a perspective on what, if any, ramifications these hearings may impact on whatever it is they do, from TNN's Clay Fielder in Amman, Jordan. Clay? - Chip. Amman has been the Jordan for- (speaking in foreign language) (static crackling) - We're having some problems with our transmission. Are you still with us, Clay Fielder in Amman Jordan? - I can hear you perfectly, Chip. Am I coming through? - Clear as a bell, Clay. But stand by. I'm told we must cut back to Washington, where the tension is mounting with each growing moment, as the committee awaits the impinging appearance of Secretary of State Bishop. Merry? - Secretary Bishop has, in fact, just arrived, Chip. I'm gonna try and get through here. Excuse me, sir. Merry Chase, Total Network News. You've agreed to appear before the committee, sir? - I never stopped appearing before committees, Merry. I haven't been out of this building in two years. - Mr. Secretary, you are on record as having been against the entire Mastergate operation. - I have indeed, from the very beginning. I thought it was lunatic to use a movie company as a cover for the illegal diversion of arms. - And yet sir, you played a major role in the plan. - That's a gross exaggeration. My involvement was strictly limited to the extent of my participation. - But sir, isn't it true that- - I'm sorry, Merry the truth will have to wait till after I finish testifying. - Thank you Mister, Sir. And so as he joins the parade of witnesses, the question is will Secretary of State Bishop, his well-known leaks to one side, will he be as outspoken for the record as often as he has been off in the past? TNN, Merry chase. (fast paced music) - Thank you, Merry. For those of you just joining us, I'm Chip Chatworth in Savannah, where we are continuing with our live coverage of the Mastergate hearings. Right now it's back to the committee, where Secretary Bishop is about to begin. We're told that for reasons of security, the secretary's testimony today will be heavily guarded. Secretary of State Bishop. - [Archer] Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary. - Senator. - The chair is most impressed by the courage you have shown by appearing before the committee today without benefit of council, or wife. - When you've got nothing to hide, I find you generally don't need anyone to do it behind. - Quite right sir, quite right. Our next questioner is scheduled to be Senator Naito. Senator- - There's very little love lost between these two. Secretary Bishop having been subpoenaed recently to appear before Senator Naito's committee on hindsight and deja vu. - Mr. Secretary, some six months to a half a year or so ago you were questioned by the subcommittee of this committee. Do you recall your appearance then? - I believe I looked pretty much as I do now. (audience laughing) (gavel banging) - You testified then that you were categorically opposed to the entire Mastergate idea. - Yes, I believe I testified to that. - You sure did, sir. - Then I'll take my word for it. - And yet subsequently, and prior, and all the time in between, you did all that you could to implement that very same scheme. Is that not also true? - Yes sir, that's also so. - Wouldn't you say that that was sending out a somewhat scrambled signal? - Not at all. Since everyone knew I wanted the plan to fail, I assumed everyone would know that I was against whatever it was I was trying so hard to make succeed. - How could you hope to convince anyone that you were opposed to something that you were so busy supporting? - By resigning as often as I could, without actually damaging my effectiveness on the job. - The job of implementing policies you had no particular faith in? - The Secretary of State doesn't spend his time just attending state funerals, and going to poison gas conferences. It's not all fun and games you know. - It didn't trouble you, all the carrying on that was going on? - At the very onslaught to this matter I issued a strict appeal that I was to remain as completely uninformed as possible about this entire operation, so that I could maintain a perfectly honest front about what was going on behind my back. - Just how did you put your ignorance into action? I was content to let Mr. Slaughter make whatever arrangements were being made with the person with whom he was making them with. - And with whom would that person have been in the person of? - Vice President Burden. (crowd murmuring) (gavel banging) - I'm not reminding everyone again. - With the Vice President himself? The former director of the CIA was dealing with the Vice President? - Before you jump to any conclusions, I hasten to add that the vice president personally assured me that although he approved of these arrangements, he can prove that he knew nothing about them because he was present in the room at the time they were being made. - If the vice president were present, how does that square with the fact that the vice president has repeatedly reiterated that he never knew of the plan? - I would take that to mean that he knew of it until such time as it became impossible for him to know that he did. - Did the president know that the vice president knew? - Knew what? - Everything that he didn't know. - No one else was in a position not to know as much as the president didn't. - The President of the United States had no idea that his people would eventually pump a billion dollars, one billion dollars into the so-called making of a film, but actually for the purpose of purchasing elicit arms? You have a grave responsibility, sir to explain to the American people right here and right now why those of you who had the president's ears chose to pull the wool over his eyes? - May I remind the chair of the terms of our agreement? Wherein my appearance here today, would perforce be limited due to a prior commitment on a matter of intelligence, I'm forbidden to reveal in which national security interests prohibit any further clarification of. - The chair so remembers. I'm afraid I'll have to cut you off, Senator Naito. You are accordingly excused, Mr. Secretary. - I can't, however, leave Mr. Chairman without staying to say that I admit, that yes mistakes were made, I'll give you that. But it is hearing's such as these which make it so hard for us to reach out to the corporate sector to recruit those with the managerial experience necessary to make this government work. You can't take these people out of big business, and suddenly make them become answerable for their actions. It is hearing's such as these, which make it inevitable for private citizens to become public embarrassments. Yes, mistakes were made, some dreadful ones. But they were honest mistakes, honestly made, honestly dreadful. I think this committee ought to realize that if we are going to punish those who made them, we are only making it harder and harder to attract those people who will make the mistakes of the future. - Thank you, Mr. Secretary. (gavel banging) - [Announcer] From TNN, award worthy anchorman, Chip Chatworth. - A short pause in TNN's live coverage at the Mastergate hearings for a look at these fast breaking stories making the news at this hour. In London, a major sex scandal today rocked the English parliament, where it was revealed that Minister of Defense, Sir Jeremy Smallpiece, has admitted to having an affair with several members of a government commission appointed to investigate reports of his immoral behavior. And in, Tokyo minister of finance Hiteki Matsuhisa, has pleaded guilty to stock fraud charges and faces fines of up to 700 million yen, or roughly $3,000. While in Rome, newly elected Prime Minister, Aldo Manucci, seen here at taking office, has been charged with taking a bribe during his swearing in ceremony. And now let's get back to an update from TNN' Merry chase in Washington, DC, where along with other hordes of the press, we await the arrival of this hour's man of the hour, major Manley Battle. Merry? - Great excitement here, Chip as Major Battle and his wife are literally being besieged outside the Capitol building, where momentarily the Major is about to make his scheduled appearance. - Clay Fielder is with us for TNN in Jerusalem. Major Battle is quite a hero in that neck of the woods, is he not Clay, having taught the Israelis how they shoot their Patriot missiles from left to right? (static buzzing) - Can you hear me, Clay? (static buzzing) - Clay, we seem to be experiencing some satellite difficulties. We'll have to get back to you as ASAP as possible. Right now we rejoin the hearing room for the swearing in before the committee of Major Battle. (gavel banging) - [Archer] Do you swear the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? - I do. - Mr. Hunter, would you please begin? - April 15th of the year that Mastergate was launched, major. Does that date, April 15th, ring a nerve? - Loud and clear, yes sir. - That was the on which you flew to California along with Mr. Lamb, is that correct? - Mr. Lamb traveled by commercial carrier. Standing orders forbid me to fly on anything but a Stealth Bomber. - Well, that certainly goes business class one better, I would think. (audience laughing) (gavel banging) - Mr. Chairman, council is perfectly well aware that- - [Archer] And who are you, sir? - Lance Boil, Mr. Chairman, Major Battle's attorney. - Mr. Hunter is perfectly well aware that in order to maintain strict security, Major Battle is required to fly, drive, even walk underneath any possible detection by radar. - The committee is not insensitive to Major Battle's sensitive position, Mr. Boil, neither is it unaware that the major sports and extremely high profile in one media or the other, for someone who is supposed to stay so close to the ground. - Publicity is a small price to pay for a secrecy, sir. - [Archer] That I'll grant you. Proceed ahead, Mr. Hunter. - What exactly was your purpose in semi-accompanying Mr. Lamb to California, Major? Paying special attention to the truth, if you will. - I was to ride shotgun for him, sir, to supervise the duck alignment. - Set them all in a row? - Affirmative. - In plain English, if that's even remotely possible, would you describe for us the meeting that Mr. Lamb convened upon his arrival in California? - It was scheduled for 0800 hours at Master Motion Picture Studios with the late Rob Merit, CEO of MPI. - Would you have known whatever was said at that meeting? - Every word. Miles away, ostensibly enjoying a martini in the polo lounge of the Beverly Hills hotel, my olive allowed me to eavesdrop on their conversation electronically. - Mr. Lamb had been wired? - Mr. Lamb's suit had been made with specially treated threads that acted as micro transmitters, so that we always knew the precise position of his location, providing he was never more than six feet away from his clothes, which happened quite regularly once we got to Hollywood. - After putting down at LAX, Mr. Lamb was limoed by secured stretch to MPI to pay a courtesy call on the aforesaid Mr. Merit, and to personally hand him the resignation speech Mr. Merrit was to deliver, as well as a first draft of his suicide note. - All this proceeded the point at which Mr. Lamb took over the studio? - He became Chief Dog in Charge, yes sir. - He ran the studio? - He did. - And you ran Mr. Lamb? - As per Mr. Slaughter's pre and post death orders. - By what authority do you suppose- - Mr. Hunter, Mr. Hunter, having expanded your time, I will ask you to yield the questioning to Senator Bunting if you will. - Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Major. - Thank you Mr. Hunter. Senator Bunting? - I Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Hunter. - Thank you, Senator. - Thank you, Senator. - Major. - Senator. - Let us to get to the heart of the meat, shall we Major? - Ready on the firing line, sir. - I ask you to turn your attention, a position I might add at which used stand magnificently, to the production schedule at the Master Studios at the time of the government's engobblement of it, in particular to a proposed motion picture show entitled, "Tet: the Movie," dealing with the Vietcong offensive, in which our B1 bombers proved helpless against their godless 10 speed bikes because Congress had not shown enough gumption to allow surgically selective air strikes against the enemies most residential districts. - May I ask the Senator to kindly stop raking over dead horses? - And may I remind the Senator of the major's familiarity with the Tet Offensive, having led his command in several historic assaults on that occasion, including one against his own men. - I yield to no man in bound to the heights of the depth that this nation owes Major Battle, and whose many decorations spill over onto your very own chest, sir. In fact, I would be highly remissive in not reading into the record the major's remarkable recipiency of multiple military awards, including that bronze star, the purple heart, the meritorious service medal, and the legion of honor, all of which he earned during his two hours in Vietnam. - Tours, sir. - What? - Two tours, not two hours. (audience laughing) - Oh. Oh yeah, yes of course. But it's still kind of impressive anyway. - No worry, sir. - Tell us then if you would, what you can major, about Tet. - Tet the movie, or Tet for real, sir? Oh no, no no. Tet the the movie, if you please. - Yes sir, well it was originally conceived as a high budgeted action film, with a good deal of war footage and bloodshed to be ready in time for a Christmas release. - And what exactly was the budget of the movie at the time of the movie's conceivement? - $80 million, which is considered a lot of money in Hollywood, sir. - Well, I'm sure it is. - I, as it turned out, was aware of, "Tet: the Movie," not only from my own firsthand to hand experience in Vietnam, but also from having read, "Tet: the Book," in manuscript form at the CIA, long before the agency knew who the author was going to be. The story dealt with a young American soldier who achieves his manhood by setting fire to a village school house filled with Vietcong posing as five-year-olds. Now the original plan was to shoot the picture in the Philippines, wherefore a monetary consideration, as much napalm and agent orange as necessary would be dropped on the Philippine countryside and its inhabitants. Such was the level of our cooperation between Washington and the then residents of the presidential palace in Manila, or Neiman Marcos as it was called in house. (audience laughing) At Mr. Slaughter's direction, it was decided to shoot the movie in San Elvador. - San Elvador, that would be the Republic of San Elvador? - It would. - I wonder if I might ask you to give us a more graphic representation of the situation, major? If I could just ask my niece and nephew to bring in the easel? - Yes sir. If we can have the map, please? As you can see, Senator Elvador lies just to the right of center here in Central America It has a democratic form of government that's been run by its military for the past 40 years. Patiently anticommunist, with a vigorous opposition press, and free elections that are promised regularly. But most geopolitically significant, there is San Elvador's unmistakable proximityship to its immediate neighbor to the far left, Ambigua. - Ambigua was, during the time of which we are speaking of, back then, a totalitarian Lennon Marxist, in your opinion sir? - It was a red disease of hearts, sir. Yes, the whole nine yards. - And completely controlled by Moscow? - Does the Pope wright an encyclical? (audience laughing) (gavel banging) - Major, I'm sure that this committee, as well as the country for which we stand, would be most appreciative for you to share some of your invaluable daylight with us on that sad, proud, and benighted land. - The Republic of Ambigua, or La Republica de Ambigua, was yet another in a string of betrayed revolutions, wherein a legitimate set of high ideals were cruelly twisted, and civically Sovietized. The United States had had a long period of the most intimate relations with Ambiguian Government, the last 18 of Ambigua's Presidents being West Point graduates. That is until La coup occurred, and the reins of power changed hands, when the former President of Ambigua, General Delinqua, and the country's Prime Minister, Mrs. Delinqua, were in New York on an emergency shopping trip. At which point the government was taken over by a doctor, Overtaga, a former podiatrist and his band of foot soldiers. - The United States was quick to immediately recognize the new Overtaga regime, where we not? - Self interest begins at home, sir. You have to remember the mind set of our thinking at the time, Senator. The US Air Force then had thousands of personnel in Ambigua, learning the ABC's of or IBM's, manning or missile silo positions. Within hours of seizing the presidential throne, Overtaga order a government staged protest, where eight by 10 pictures of John Wayne, part of the foreign aid we shipped them, were burned by crowds waving Satan go home signs. Soviet advisenicts armed the Ambiguans, with vast quantities of automatic Baryshnikovs, ground to air rockets, and heat seeking machetes. But, most provocatively, and least acceptable, they had built underground nuclear missile silos below our underground nuclear missile silos, so that we were in danger of becoming the first military force in history to ever be attacked simultaneously from behind, and from below. - And all the while this country, the most powerful nation in the land, stood by just sucking on his blanket? - Only semi-so, sir. There wasn't constant stab at efforts to appeal to Overtaga to fold his country back into democracy. - Including a stab at Overetaga himself, am I right? - We tried everything from private persuasion, to public assassination. What we finally scoped in on as our best hope was a group of idealistic Ambigualitos, still loyal to the delinquent government, and hiding in the hills in the Santro Pez, willing to make any sacrifice to overthrow the overthrow, to once more make The People's Republic, the republic of the people. - This was the group known as Los Otros? - Yes sir, the Los Otros, the others, a rag tag band of guerrilla fighters badly in need of humanitarian aid, and arms such as rifles, grenades, mortars, Jeeps, and gunships. - And what sort of humanitarian aid? - Blankets, medicine, and the necessary rocket launchers, tanks, and napalm to protect those blankets. - [Folsom] Yeah well Congress, of course, had approved this aid, had it not? - Oh, it had. - And yet, just a few months later, this very same Congress refused to vote more assistance to these very same Los Otros. Now, you correct me unless I'm wrong major. - You are correct, sir. Correct, this Congress was disgraceful. - Disgraceful. That's a very strong word, Major! - I believe that this particular shoe fits like a glove. (gavel banging) (crowd murmuring) - Senator, I resent your cognizant egging on of the defendant. - You mean witness, sir! - You sit down! - Your chicken behavior has finally come home to roost, sir! - Play with fire power, Senator, you get burned! - We are not here to hurl bumper stickers at one another, Major. You will kindly sit! - Major has no problem standing up for democracy, Mr. Chairman! - Indeed he has not! (gavel banging very loudly) Major Battle, sitting here in the shadow of this magnificent painting of our founding fathers, the fine example of the kind of art that a man can take his whole family to watch, although I know it doesn't go for everyone on this here committee. But this is a big country, Major and it never forgets. But what it won't remember, I can assure you, are those among us would single you out for scathing, for merely doing your duty. No, we all may applaud Washington crossing the Delaware, but when Washington starts crossing fine officers such as yourself sir, then I consider it both a shame, and my honor to apologize on behalf of all those men, countless women, and especially children who have been left without a prayer in our school system, who need heroes to grow up to, role models that don't come any better than your own gallant wife's husband. Hang in there, sir. There are millions of us in your platoon, proud and honored to serve America's only four star major. (gavel banging) - Thank you, Senator Bunting for your most objective presentation of your own point of view. - Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. - I would remind the members of this committee that no American is any more American than any other American. I would hope there would be no further displays of anyone trying to prove they are gung holier than now. Having so said, I will at this time turn over the questioning of the witness to my good colleague, Representative Sellers. - I thank the chair. Major Battle? - Sir. - [Merry] Congressman Sellers, himself a Vietnam vet, having flown several missions into Hanoi with Jane Fonda. - While we're still in a tributary vein, I'd like to add my chorus of approval for your many years of outspoken devotion to the defense of this country, which I as a fellow service man, have also devoted countless weekends to. - Well, every little bit helps, sir. - [Sydley] America is indeed a land worth fighting for, is it not, Major? - I've got a head full of shrapnel to prove it. - Can you think of another one anywhere where members of the armed forces are free to publicly vocalize their criticism of the actions of the legislature? - Zip, sir. - With that in mind, can you, if you can, amplify your implication that the Congress's decision to deny it donating additional aid to the Los Ostros was disgraceful. That was the epitaph you just hurled, was it not? - I consider the word a direct hit. Without further monetary stroke military aid, scores of Ambiguan freedom lovers, who had gone way out on their life and limbs for us were literally cut off at the knees without a paddle. - But not quite. In as much as Mr. Slaughter managed to save the day, did he not? - Mr. Slaughter, having assessed San Elvador's extreme adjacentnes alongside Ambigua, saw it's immediate possibility as a base for supplying arms to the Los Ostros. - Thereby permitting the United States to continue to supply the resistance with arms, and humanitarian aid? - Well, as the pipeline had considerably narrowed, we were only able to supply that aid that was inhumanitarian. - [Sydley] The operation was immediately green-lighted, and with you in charge? - Yes sir. - With you, in turn, reporting to Mr. Slaughter? - When he was between comas, yes sir. Otherwise he was completely conscious of the fact I was acting for him whenever he was not. - Were you conscious that Mr. Slaughter's plan had a minor hitch, Major, that the Congress had voted against any and all additional aid to the Los Ostros, had in fact passed a law making it illegal to provide such assistance? - It was Congress's bat and ball, sir. - Nevertheless, you and the Director simply decided to do an end run around the legislative branch of the United States? - That's not exactly the way I would put it, sir. - How would you put it, Major? - I would say that's when Operation Master Plan kicked in. - [Sydley] You prefer euphemisms, do you? - I prefer calling a spade by its codeword, sir. - In whatever words you like, Major, suppose you scope us in on just exactly how Operation Master Plan worked. - Well, that takes us back to Tet, sir. - The movie, the book, the war, or the album? - The movie, sir. The shooting script called for a number of battles scenes between the US and the Vietcong forces. Master Studios had purchased a certain amount of military hardware from several other movie companies, plus a great many additional weapons from certain middle Eastern powers anxious to dump them because they came with so many instructions. These battle sequences was scheduled to be filmed in Southern San Elvador, at the point at which it borders on Northern Ambigua. The plan was to ship somewhat more additional military supplies to the movie company, than had been indicated in the script, and then reroute them to the Los Otros encampments. - And just how much more than somewhat are we talking about? - $800 million with, sir. - $800 million of unauthorized expenditure. - What price tag would you hang on the Statue of Liberty, sir? - This tenfold leap from the film's budget of 80, to $800 million, this didn't raise an eyebrow or two at the studio? If not among the government employees, then certainly amongst the professional picture people? - The amount was finessed by cross-collateralizing the difference over the cost of several other movies being made at MPI at the same time. - [Sydley] No one in Hollywood was any the wiser? - As a rule of thumb, no sir. - Not even when later added costs to the making of the motion picture would finally escalate to one billion dollars? - One billion, three with catering. - You were in San Elvador when the arms arrived, Major to help divert them clandestinely to Ambigua? - I was operating undercover in a change of identity mode. - You were not who you normally are? - I was not any one of those that I've sometimes been. Mr. Slaughter made it possible for me to act as his right arm, by putting me in the cast. Working in the film, I could be in the scene and on the scene at the same time. - And no one at all knew of this plan, except for those of you who wanted those of us not to, not the Congress, not the press, not the American people? - None of the above, no sir. - Major, you took an oath as an officer to obey your Commander in Chief, did you not? - I was standing right there when I did it, sir. - Would you feel it your duty, if your Commander in Chief, the President of the United States ordered you to break the law? - Well, I do not believe my president would order me to do such a thing, not knowingly. - I want you to think hard, Major. - Starting when, sir? - Did the president know of The Master Plan, plan? - I was told he didn't know. - By whom? - The same people that told him he didn't know. - And they would be who? Would you know? - Key members of his staff, those players that keep track of what he knows, what he knew, and what he later won't, people that have the president's memory at their fingertips. - The president then, to the best of your knowledge, had absolutely none of his own. - He may have had knowledge of it, without knowing he did. - The president can't be expected to know everything he knows, is that what you're saying? - It's hard enough for him to remember all that he doesn't. - Tell me, Major. If you were the president, do you think you might possibly have liked to have known? - All due respect aside, Congressmen, Major Battle doesn't happen to be one of the men who is president at this time. - I beg to differ, Mr. Boil. I happen to think that Major Battle was the president more often than we'll ever know, as well as Secretary of State, of Defense, of God knows of Secretary What Else and Whatever. Many, a world leader has played with toy soldiers. What we have in Major Battle, I believe, is a soldier who played with toy leaders. Don't you think this country deserves better, Major? - I happen to think that this country deserves the very best, sir. Although, in all honesty, it can't always be counted on to know what that is for itself. I take pride in being part of that tiny fist full of men who steal into the night that others sleep so soundly through, to leave my wife and children every chance I get, riding point on missions contrived to keep America in the win column against whatever enemy, without and within, half an eye over both shoulders, trying to save this country before this so-called Congress of ours passes a law against that too. I'm history, Mr. Chairman. I certainly can't make any of it sitting around here. (dramatic music) - Merry Chase at the hearings in Washington, DC, the drama following Major Battle's appearance keeps building, does it not? - Indeed it has, Chip. - The Major, going over the committee's head to the country, as he did, at large. - For the real dope on that story, we'll have to wait for the committee's next witness, star witness to be more accurately precise. - [Merry] Here is Vice President Burden now, as always, surrounded by Mrs. Burden, and a great deal of security as well. Vice President Burden is certainly the loftiest government official ever to submit himself yet to questioning by a congressional hearing - Word is that the White House is counting on the Vice President to dislinger the suspicions that the president was somehow personally involved in the Mastergate coverup himself. - [Merry] This is a vice president who will stand by his man, Chip. As we all know, he's a tough fighter who can take the bit between his teeth, as well as dish it out. (gavel banging) - Morning, Mr. Vice President. - Senator. - [Archer] The chair would respectfully ask you not to take yours just yet, sir. Raise your right hand, please. Do you swear the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? - I do. - [Archer] You may be seated. Do you wish to make an opening statement, Mr. Vice President? - I might just make one when we're finished. - Let me ask Mr. Hunter then, if he would, to begin the questioning. - Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Mr. Vice President. - Morning's is what America's all about, Mr. Hunter. Fresh beginnings, family around the oatmeal. Better today's are the yesterday's of better tomorrows. - Yes sir. - I'd like to start by asking whether it's true or not, Mr. Vice President that the administration, Congress having slammed the door in its face, additional funding wise, in terms of aiding the guerrillas, turned around and created a secondary enterprise in order to replenish said dried up funding? Would that be a correct depiction of an assumption, sir? - If you mean did we take action, action to promote the cause of freedom of values, the answer is yes. There's one thing this president knows. You can't just sit around. You can't put history on hold. There is no snooze button on the American dream. - And this said replenishment was accomplished by inviting certain pivotal players to the Capitol to provide pivotal capital. Is that also correct? - It is. - In the manner of how? - Well, this was all some time ago, and I didn't bother to take any notes, all of which were destroyed by mistake. But as I recall, Major Battle would fly up periodically from the movie location for the purpose of briefing would be contributors to the conflict on the progress of the same. - And when the major made his pitch, did he speak to potential patrons of the war all by himself? - He did. - Isn't it true, sir that you were sometimes there to help? - I was. - [Shepherd] Oh, you confirm that? - I've never denied it, once I finally admitted it. - Where you there often? - Not that many. - Once or twice? - The first two times, about 80 all together. - What about the president? - Was the president over there himself, sas he? - He was not. And although the president of the United States doesn't need any help in being resentful, I certainly deplore the constant efforts of this committee to somehow finagle his good name into all this. - Mr. Vice President, the amount collected from private donors was in excess of $100 million, for which the contributors received what, if anything? Can you tell us? - They were invited to the Pentagon where, along with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, they attended a prayer breakfast in the Moore Room. And then each was given a small gift. - You're talking about the cassette? - That's right. - The video cassette purporting to show the Los Otros in action? - [Dale] Right. - Although, as we have since come to know, this motion picture footage was staged and shot by the motion picture company in order to create the impression that the real war was going swimmingly. This is the same footage, was it not, that was fed to and shown on national television, with the desired effect of falsely luring the American public into the impression that they were watching the real thing? - Do you want the truth? The truth is the American people have had a belly full of watching more footage. After all these years of revolt and rebellion throughout the world and other places, the American people simply are sick and tired of looking at all the killing and fighting on the box. You're burning cities, and your baby burials, it's just so much dinnertime background bang, bang. Still in all, it was felt that there would be more support for the defeat of Overtaga if the country thought that we had any kind of chance of winning the movie. - You mean the war? - Yeah, that too. - Which in the real world, Overtaga's forces, and not those we were supporting, were really winning? - That's correct. - Mr. Vice President, I need some help, sir. If you could think of me as a human being, rather than a lawyer, how does a simple citizen reconcile such reckless cynicism as being consistent with the pristine and puritanical principles that we as a people purport to support? - No one seems to mind when the shoe was on the other foot, when the right hand, when the right hand doesn't know what the left wing is doing. I personally see no great harm in divergent differences. This country has met the challenge of oppositional point of views many times in our history, without our coming out any worse for the exercise. - Do you have some specific example of such an exercise in mind, Mr. Vice President? - Well, certainly. The Civil War for one. - In which tens of thousands of Americans slaughtered each other? You don't think we came out any the worse for that, sir? - At least we cleared the air. You know what I'm saying? - These funds you'll raise privately, they were spent on purchasing additional arms, which were then smuggled down to the Los Otros? - Flown down in an airborne manner. Unfortunately, just before the first of these plane's landing, the entire shipment hit the fan, due of course, to the unexpected attack by the Los Otros on the embassy. - Our embassy? The US Embassy? - Well, what it was was, it was movie set of the US Embassy that was attacked. - I confess to a slight logic lag, Mr. Vice President. Why an attack on an American embassy, real or otherwise, by the very people that we're trying to help? Why would they bite the hand that armed them? - Well, it was their way of protesting Congress's wishy washy aid cut off, uncognizant that funding for their cause had now been privatized. They didn't have a clue, weaponry speaking, that they were about to get a fresh blast of sunshine pumped up their skirts. They were warned, their actions were bound to doom any future funding. And for certainty, they would never work in another movie again. But it meant nothing to them, avail wise. They answered by blowing up the embassy, both the set and the real one. Now, on a positive note, I would add that due to all of the years of training that we gave them, the Los Otros fought magnificently that day, even though it was us they were fighting. I think the fact that they were able to inflict so many casualties among those who taught them how is proof that our money wasn't totally wasted. - The net result of which was that the motion picture, "Tet: the Movie," was never finished. - Well, when the resistance turned against us, we pulled out all together, except for leaving behind the standing styrofoam movie set representing the front of an American high school, with the hope that it would be used to further the education of all the children in the region. - So it was all for nought, sir? All you illicit solicitations, the countless congressional transgressions, all the squandered lives, and all the laundered dollars, all the shame to which you've subjected this nation, this government, the government of the United States, the government of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Nebraska, Iowa, Texas, Lemain, Lemmon, of Tip-a-canoe, and Truman too. It was all were for nought, sir, for nought. - Mr. Chairman, other members of the rest of the committee, I think there's something that has pretty well been lost sight of in these hearings. Something a great deal more than blame has brought us to where we are here today. And it is not called blame. It's what the president has called grabbing the situation by its initiatives. Now we didn't ask the British, please sir, can we become a nation? No sir! If we hadn't broken every law in the book back in 1770 whatever, if we had been happy to remain miserable as Englishman, each one of us would have driven to Capitol Hill today here on the left side of the road, and our president, would have been a queen! (audience applauding) (gavel banging) (dramatic music) - The most defensive of government politics, testimony of Vice President Burton, who was in rare form. Wouldn't you say, Merry Chase for TNN? - Rare form indeed, Chip. The vice president gave the press warning that he was going to give no quarter in presenting his half of the story, that he was gonna tell it like it was. And I would say he certainly delivered. Everyone here quite impressed how truthful he can be, when he feels it's absolutely necessary. - And now for a live feed from his vantage point in Los Angeles, let's go to Clay Fielder for his reaction to the vice president's appearance before the committee. Clay. - Chip. - How do you think the vice president's testimony played on the West Coast? - Well, Chip. (rocks crashing) Chip! (rocks crashing repeatedly) - Our Los Angeles studio seems to have been hit by another of this week's tremors. We'll return there in a few shakes. Merry, thank you. I'm informed we're going back to the hearing room for some comments by Senator Bowman. (gavel banging) - The chair would like to express on behalf of the committee, our joined gratitude to those whose testimony will form the basis for this panel's deliberation, gestation, and recommended legislation, all of (buzzing) will be scrutinized (buzzing) Never forget, of course, our mandate to temper with mercy so that the (microphone ringing) (electricity buzzing) Will the Sergeant at Arms- (electricity crackling) (people yelling in shock) What is going on here? - We seem to be experiencing some technical difficulties here, Chip. Do you have any idea there, what's going on here? Chip? Chip? Chip? - Sergeant at Arms! (bomb falling) (electricity crackling) (ominous music) (alarm blaring) (ominous music) - There seems to be some interference, something very powerful. Whatever it is, it seems to be quite beyond the control of anyone in this room. - We're getting nothing but static on our monitors, Merry. Hold on. All networks are also reporting, a total loss of picture. (ominous music) (video tape whining) - Whatever you're watching, wherever you are, this is now all you are able to see. I am Wiley Grim Slaughter. September 24th, 1904 to April 3, 1990. (coughing) - Incredible as it may seem, the hearing room has been rocked by the appearance of the late director of the CIA. - Having anticipated the inevitability of this hearing, I took great pains to produce the picture you're receiving, a holographic image of me, that creates the illusion that I am present in this room. (electricity crackling) (people yelling) I will, of course, answer no questions here today. Swearing me in, were it even remotely possible, would serve as little purpose now as it ever did in the past. I am not here to plead ignorance, or to pass the buck. I am here to take responsibility for it all, to bask in your blame. (coughing) Mastergate is not the end of it all, not by a long shot. It's only a matter of time before you're all scandalized by the stars or the next unavoidable whatever-gate. - You are watching live, the dead Mr. Slaughter. - This hearing is just one more episode in a series that will never end. You will call no further witnesses, Mr. Chairman. You will convene no more. Until next time, this committee, (electricity surging) you, (electricity surging) and you, (electricity flowing) and you, are all adjourned.
