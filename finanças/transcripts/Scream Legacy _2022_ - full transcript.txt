Um, you want to? Alright. Uh, it was actually a couple of days ago... Very same bar... And uh, homegirl over here actually had two dates. [Ashley] Uh-- Yeah! Uh... yeah. Her Tinder date ditched her... So she got all drunk at the bar, and uh-- I was just sitting, minding my own business, and she just-- Started talking to me. And your friend was very lit! [Ashley] Uh! No. [Daniel] Yeah! Very animated! Very friendly. That's just how I am, right? [Katie] Yeah. She knows how to have fun. And we kind of hit it off! [Ashley] Yeah. Now here we are. I'm meeting her best friend, and-- Everything looks up from here. [Ashley] He was really sweet and I figured you'd like him. No, no, no, no-- I'm just so happy that you were able to take care of her. Thank you, I'm glad you're here safe, there's a reunion. Everyone's happy. You know-- Well, you know... to a beautiful night! [Ashley] Yes! A beautiful night! [Zoey] Are we on? We live? Great! What's up my faithful listeners, this is Zoey Kessler and welcome back to Zoey's Corner-- This is Episode 82-- But, before we can start, I want to address something going on today. As some of you may see on the news, police were called to a crime scene earlier-- Where someone was found dead inside. Now you know me, I have my sources... And I learned that the victim is a local therapist-- Who might've had a patient before by the name of Sidney Prescott! That's right, THE Sidney Prescott. This is huge! We haven't had a murder here in Woodsboro since before I was born-- And I'm going to get to the bottom of this. So stay tuned, we'll be right back! [Katie] I told myself I was only going to have a couple of drinks tonight. [Ashley] It's fine, it's a special occasion. Katie? [Katie] Maggie? I knew that was you! Hey! Oh my God! It's so good to see you! I know! You look so good! It's like reunion city tonight! Perks of living in a small town. Yeah! Anyways, call me when you get settled-- Let's catch up. I will! Okay, bye! I forgot to ask her for a round. I'll be right back. So, how's your grandpa doing? There was a rough patch... You know, with the chemo treatments. But he's been coming around the past few months. Yeah? That's good. He's been keeping his yard looking really nice! So, I guess it's good he's keeping active. What about your mom? How is she? She's good. Uh, it's been a few weeks since I spoke to her. We don't... we don't keep in touch as much as I'd like. Where is she these days? Well, you know... the next time you talk to her, tell her I said hey. I will. Is that Will? That's Will, that's Will, that's Will-- I look awful, let's get out of here! I mean, you look fine. But we can go. We can go. [Will] Katie! Will! What are you, avoiding me? [Katie] I'm not avoiding you. Yeah, you could've fooled me. Wow, you look um, you look great. Excuse me. Hi. Hi... I didn't know you were coming back. I'm just here for the summer. How's everything? How's life? How's school? It's good. I'm finishing up my last year. Yeah you always were so smart. No, I just.. I wish I was with you. You know? You could've been... But you chose not to, so... What are you doing later? How long are you in town for? I don't know. I'm just here for a few weeks. Okay, cool. I mean, would you want to? Would I want to what? Would you want to... Let me take you out? We could always stay in... Stay in? Like old times. Um... Would you like that? Let me get settled first. Okay? Okay... Oh, Will, I just got here! I have to unpack... I haven't even seen my grandpa... Sure. Come over tonight. Yeah? Yeah. Alright. I'll see you. I'll see you around. Man, these stakeouts are so boring dude. Nothing ever happens! Hey! You awake? Nope. You're never awake man. You need to get some sleep, bro. You still taking your treatments or what? Nah man. I can't take those, man. Come on, dude. How's Carrie and the boys? Oh, they're good dude. Yeah? Yeah. Good. Jason made the baseball team, and Justin-- Yeah! My boy Justin is dominating the football field. So we're looking, we're looking pretty good for a scholarship man! That's good. I'm excited. That's good to hear, man. Thanks. You know that they're better than their dad already, so that's a good start, right? You're not wrong, Detective. You're not wrong. Man, why do you still wear that thing? I don't know it's a reminder, I guess. I mean, we still love each other, but... man, this job. Yeah. It's best that they stay away from it. Or, I don't know, stay away from me I guess. But, they're talking to me again at least. So... I got that going, right? You're lucky man. You're lucky. Hold on to it. Hey man, don't worry about it. You know, they're-- No matter what, they're always going to love you. Period. Yeah, I know. [phone ringing] Here we go. Castillo. [dispatch] Hey Castillo. I have a Detective Morgan with Woodsboro PD-- Requesting your assistance with a 10-54... He says it's pretty urgent. Woodsboro? [dispatch] Yeah, can you get over there? ASAP? Alright, copy that. We're on our way. [Zoey] And that's it on Zoey's Corner. Join me next week-- On Zoey's Corner. Take care. [phone ringing] Hello? [caller] Hello Zoey. Who is this? [caller] One of your faithful listeners. How did you get my number? [caller] Oh I have my sources. Okay. Get a life. By the way, nice Ghostface impression. Best one I've heard yet. [caller] Maybe because it's the real one. What was that? [caller] You heard me. [caller] What's the matter Zoey? Cat got your tongue? Look, go prank someone else, dude. [statue] What's your favorite scary movie? Shit! [phone ringing] Look, I said go prank someone else! [caller] You still think this is a prank? Yeah I do. It's unoriginal. This shit was funny twenty years ago. Now it's just over played. [caller] You really want to know who I am? Yes. [caller] I'm the last person you're ever going to see alive! Okay asshole, this isn't funny anymore. [caller] I wouldn't hang up on me. It didn't work out so well for the last person. What the hell do you want? [caller] I want to show you what happens when you stick your nose in other people's business! Look... call me again, and I'm calling the fucking cops! [caller] They'd never make it in time. Your house is quite a drive from the police station. How do you know where I live? [caller] Because I'm in the garage. Shit! [phone ringing] Hello? No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Katie? Can I help you? Beth... Hawkins. Your mom's old friend. Oh my God, Beth? How are you? I'm good, look at you! I haven't seen you since you were a kid. It's good to see you! I'm sorry, was I interrupting? Oh, no. I'm just visiting my grandma. What are you doing here? My mom's buried over there. I visit her once a week. It's peaceful here. I like it. It is! It is. So, what are you up to? Oh, you know... married, kids, three dogs-- You know, typical mom life. Yeah! No, that's good, uh... oh, how's Zoey? Zoey! Zoey's good. She got accepted to Stanford. Stanford? Yeah, she starts in the fall. Look. Oh, you must be so proud. Yeah, she wants to get into reporting. Well, yeah that makes a lot of sense-- She always idolized Gale Weathers. So true. So what else is going on? Not-- I, I'm, you know, just focusing on me-- I'm in school right now. Yeah? Oh, I remember those college days. Didn't you go to Windsor with my mom? Um, yeah I was supposed to, but it fell through at the last minute. That's probably for the best, I'm sure you heard what happened over there. I did. I was heartbroken when I heard about Randy... Such a nice guy, right? I'm glad your mom made it out okay. How is she by the way? I haven't seen her since our reunion. She's actually, she's doing okay. She's off the grid right now. Yeah? What's her number? I'd love to catch up with her. Uh-- I can't give that out. Oh, come on. She knows me. What's her number? Beth, I-- I'm not going to give that out. Oh, shoot you know what? I've got to pick up Zoey, we have a family dinner. It was so nice to see you. Don't forget to get me your mom's number. Okay? And you know what? You can find me on social media. We can plan lunch. [Morgan] Did we get in touch with the owners of this building? [Fraser] Yeah. We need those tapes, man. We're going to get them. Here are my guys... Detectives, right? Yeah. Detective Hoffman. This is Castillo. Castillo. Chad Morgan. This is my partner, Paul Fraser. Good to meet you guys. Castillo. We really do appreciate your help. Yeah, glad to assist. What do we got? Two victims here... Both dead with multiple stab wounds. No witnesses. But we did get word from the owners of this building to take a look at the surveillance tapes. Any particular reason why you requested us? You worked those Ghostface murders back in the day, right? Years ago... in Los Angeles. I was a rookie under Kincaid when Roman Bridger carried out those attacks. [Fraser] Wait, wait, wait, you were involved in that? This guy is a legend man. That's awesome. Yeah... No, that was my welcome to the police force. You get shoved into a case like that, it stays with you. Why do you ask? I figured you want to take a look at this. Who is he? Stuart Rosenbaum. A psychiatrist. Now, his secretary said she came in and found him after a weekend vacation. She also found the janitor somewhere else in the building. Also stabbed to death. What does this have to do with the Ghostface murders? Well, until a few years ago... Sidney Prescott was one of his patients. And, that's not all... We checked his office... Her file is missing. You good? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm good. [Ashley] Katie! Hey! Hey! Hey, do you need help with your luggage or anything? I just have one bag. Thanks, though. No problem. Is your grandpa still up? Uh, I don't think so. He's probably in bed by now. [Lily] Hey Katie! Oh my God... is that Lily Yeah, she's grown huh? Hey! How are you? Oh my God, look how tall you've gotten. Oh my God! Mom thinks I'm going to be taller than Ashley soon! [Ashley] Alright! Okay, alright. She's going to be in town for a while, so there's plenty of time to catch up. Okay well. Bye, I'll see you later! Bye! God, she's like your mini-me, I swear. Yeah, except she's a gremlin. I think she's cute. Yeah, it's been nonstop questions about when you were coming back. It's cute! Yeah, until she's asked you fifty-seven times! Well, anyways, I'm going to head inside. Alright. Love you. Love you. What was your name again? Daniel. Uh, text me! I will. Text me! I am going to text you! Okay. Love you. Bye! Love you. Bye. Bye! Bye! Okay, she is intense... Yeah. Mhmm. I don't think she likes me very much. No, she just takes a second to come around. Mhmm... She just doesn't trust people easily. I can see that. Yes! You fucking rock, Grandpa. So what were you and Miss Friendly talking about while I was up at the bar, huh? You were clearly putting in a good word... Yeah, only bad things. I can see. Shit! No, I mean, we were-- Okay, we were just catching up on some personal stuff. It's not really my place to talk about it. Okay, hey-- You're the one, open honest communication. No secrets, rights? Okay, well, I can have some secrets with my best friend. But uh, yeah so... Alright, alright. Cool. Cool, cool, cool. You coming over later today or no? Um... well, uh, Lily and I have plans, so... That's right. That's right. Yeah. Alright. Okay, well... [Lily] Hey Ashley! Mom called. Okay. Um, I will call you later? Alright. So what did mom want? Oh, she wanted to remind you to drop off Katie's welcome home present. Okay, uh did you decide what movie you want to see? That rom-com with what's his face, the guy who plays Captain America. Oh, you mean Chris Evans... Okay, good idea. Mhm! Um, I will drop off Katie's gift and then we'll go. Okay, cool! No, I don't think that's the solution... [Hoffman] I don't think so. Well, forensics didn't find much... And the coroner said he's been dead for a few days now, so-- I doubt we'll get any leads. Yeah you probably won't. Do you know where Sidney Prescott is at nowadays? No one's heard from her in almost ten years. Well, somebody has... What about the Rileys? Are they still in town? Last I heard, Gale got an anchor job in New York and they moved. Does Sidney still have family around? Her father still might be in town, but no one knows for sure. Alright, let me make some phone calls... Let me know if anything comes up. Thanks for coming out. Thank you. So what do we do now? I'm going to make a phone call to one of my contacts in the FBI. See if we can get some answers. In the meantime, let's do some research. Alright... I'll call my wife and let her know I'm not coming home for dinner. [text] Did you enjoy the chocolates? Hey! You're awake? [text] Come upstairs. You've been upstairs this whole time? Grandpa? [television turns on] Please, God... This... is God. Oh my God... Shit! Shit! [ringing] [operator] 911, what's your emergency? Yes, yes, yes! I need, I need help! Please! I'm at 221 Rosewood Lane... There's a killer in the house wearing a Ghostface costume! He's killed my grandpa, you've got to send help, please! He's after me! [operator] Okay ma'am, get to a safe place if you can. I am, I am. I am. I'm in the master bedroom and I locked the door. You've got to hurry! You've got to hurry! [operator] I've alerted the authorities. Help is on the way. Thank you, thank you. Okay, so I just got off the phone with my contact in the FBI. What'd he say? Okay, about ten years ago, Sidney was living somewhere in California with a husband and a ten-year-old daughter... Now one night, somebody dressed in a Ghostface costume breaks in and attacks them. No shit? What happened? Well the husband was killed. But by the time the cops got there-- The killer had already escaped. Now, evidence at the scene indicated that Sidney put up a fight-- And was able to get away with her daughter... But they don't know where she's at. Wait, uh... Didn't her and Kincaid get together after all that? Uh, no. She ended up marrying an attorney from San Francisco-- Eli... Palmer. Yeah, Palmer. So, could this be the same guy? I mean, just coming back to finish the job? Her psychiatrist being killed, her file missing... It's not a coincidence. What about the daughter? What happened to her? That's a good question. Nobody knows. So what do you want to do? We need to find Sidney and her daughter... How are we supposed to do that? I mean, they could be anywhere. We have no good information to go on, at all. Rosenbaum has to have backup information somewhere... I think whenever Woodsboro PD clears the scene-- We go into his office, we search it. We search it inside out-- We look under the desk, we look in files, his computers-- Anything. Anywhere. Trash cans. There has to be something in there. So what about all this? All this was just a dead end, waste of time? Nah, it was just unfortunate memories... You worked a lot of these cases, didn't you? Only the ones in Los Angeles. Cotton Weary... That's the first case I ever worked on. No shit? Straight into the lion's den... God, no traffic? No vice? No narcotics? Nope. Straight into the deep end right from the get-go-- I was able to see what humans were capable of. So just one guy... Was responsible for all this? Roman Bridger... I was there when they rolled him out of the mansion. I couldn't believe how one person could be capable of-- So much, so much death. So much hatred. Even though it was done... It, you know, it never really left me. I guess at the time I, kind of wished that I was-- Could've saved any of them. I was still young. Still idealistic. But none of them deserved that. Yeah... So what do you think it? I mean-- Do we have a copycat killer, or? I mean, why go after Sidney after all these years? Why? I'm not sure... I thought after Roman was killed, that was it. Case closed. [phone ringing] Castillo. [Morgan] Castillo! It's Detective Morgan-- We just received a call about a home invasion and a murder nearby... The girl in the house said the killer is wearing a Ghostface costume! Castillo, the phone! [Morgan] Castillo! Are you there? Hey, text me the address. We gotta go. Gotta go. [Ashley] Katie? Oh my God... [Ashley] Katie? Katie? Katie? Katie, where are you? Shh! Shh! Don't shout! What? What's going on? Don't shout! Don't shout! Be quiet! What are you doing? What? What? What? What are you doing here? I just, I came to drop this off. What's going on? There's a killer in the house. What? Where? Behind you! Behind you! Ashley? I'm sorry... Hey! Whoa, whoa. Hey. It's just me. It's just me. Are you okay? No! What happened? Tell me what happened. Ashley just died... What? There's a killer in the house, we've got to get out of here. We've got to get out. Wait. Wait, no. Where is he? He was just in... He was... What? He was what? He was just in the house... And now he's gone... And now you're here. Wait... no. No, no, no... Katie... you think it's me? What am I supposed to think, Will? I'm pretty fucking freaked out right now-- I just saw two people killed in front of me! Okay, okay... Katie... Come on... You know me. It's Will, I would never hurt you. Katie, you know me. I'm not a killer. I'm sorry... No! I can't-- Let go of me! I can protect you! Behind you, Will! Behind you! Jesus Christ! Holy shit! Will, come on. Will! Will! Will, come on! Katie! Garage! Garage! Open the door! Will! Will! Will! Katie, go... Get out of here! Go! Will! That's right. Come at me, bitch... Katie! Go! Now! Will! [Katie] Will! Oh my God! Oh my God... Fuck you. Will! Will, Will! Oh my God, Will. Katie-- Katie! My God! Hello? Katie? [Lily] Ashley? Hello? Is everybody okay? Ashley! Katie? [Lily] Hello? Ashley? Katie? [Lily] Hello? [Lily] Is everybody okay? [Lily] Ashley! Stay alert! Check the back! Check the back! [Lily] Hello? [Lily] Hello? Hey, hey! Hey, hey ! I'm Detective Castillo, what's your name? Lily. Lily? What's going on? I don't know. My sister and her friend are inside-- And I heard banging noises and I can't get in. Okay. Okay, do you live here? No, across the street. Okay. I need you to go back over there-- You stay there. You lock the door. Do not leave until I come get you. Do you understand? Yeah. Okay, go, go, go! Police, open the door! [Castillo] Police, open the door! [Castillo] Police, open the door! [Castillo] Police! I'm in here! I'm in here, I'm in here! Police, open the door! I'm in here, I'm in here! I'm in here! Open! Open! Get back! Get back! Get down! Get down! Check the house! Check the house! Don't shoot me, please! What's going on? What's going on? Thank God... Hey, hey! Hey! What's going on? [Katie] He killed everybody. [Castillo] Who? [Katie] I don't know. He killed everybody. We got a body in here! He killed everybody! Who? Who did? I don't know. He killed everybody. It's okay... Morgan! Morgan! Mother fucker! Fuck! I can't- I can't breathe. Breathe. Just breathe... I can't breathe! Yes you can. Hey, you're safe now. You hear me? You're safe! I need you to tell me what happened. I can't! Fraser! Fraser! Oh, shit! Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. You're safe... You're safe! Okay? Nothing is going to happen to you. Okay. Hey, let's calm down... I'm trying. I'm trying... I'm trying! Okay. Okay. Breathe. Breathe. You can do this. You can do this. Okay! Okay! Okay! Let's calm down. Breathe. Okay? Now, I need you to tell me what happened. Okay! Okay! Okay, I came home and then... I found my grandfather dead and then someone in a Ghostface costume attacked me. And... And he killed my best friend and my ex-boyfriend! Okay... What- What's your name? Katie! Katie? Katie what? Katie Palmer! Katie Palmer, okay. Katie Palmer, I-- Is that your? That's my mom... Mom? You said-- You said Palmer? Yes! I don't-- Please, I don't want to die here. He's killed everybody. Please. I don't know what to do. I don't want to die. No, no, you're not going to die. I'm not-- No, no, no! I'm not going to let you die. You hear me? Yeah. Okay. You're safe. I'm going to take care-- I'm going to get you out of here, okay? Nothing is going to happen to you. I need you to trust me. We need to leave now. Let's go. Okay. Okay! Why are you doing this? Who the hell are you? Huh? Oh my God... what the fuck? Surprised? What the fuck! Hey! Language... I thought you were Miss defund the police this, defund the police that-- The second the shit hits the fan, you call the cops? See, I didn't see that coming... I'm shocked. I don't understand. Why are you doing this? Oh, well fortunately for you Katie, I'm here to help make you understand! Now... I'm looking for a certain someone-- And I think you might know where she is. Hmm? You'll never find her. You're wasting your time. Oh, I don't think I am. And you're starting to sound like your grandaddy. You don't want to end up like him do you? How the hell do you even know her? Well that's the thing, Katie. I don't. Not personally at least. But she's going to pay for what she did to me and my family. I guarantee you that. You and your family? Who the hell are you? Daniel... Loomis. Loomis? Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho... That name rings a bell now I see. Looks like Katie's starting to understand things... She killed my bro, she killed my mom. Your mother tore my family apart. You know what it's like to be ten years old-- And to be told that your mother's been killed by America's favorite victim Sidney Prescott-- And some fucking dollar tree journalist fucking wannabe Gale Weathers? And what's my consolation prize? Oh, they just ship me out to a fucking abusive foster family chock-full of alcoholics-- Not exactly an ideal place to raise a child now, is it? My mom was a good woman... You call murdering innocent people being a good woman? She was just as sick as Billy! Hey, hey! She was protecting her family when no one else would! I don't know what you want me to say! I had no part in any of this. All of this was before my time! Oh, well I guess you're just a victim of circumstance now are you Katie... Huh? Welcome to the club. Sucks don't it? Now, I'm not going to let you ruin this for me-- It's been ten years in the making. I came this close to getting your mom-- But that son of a bitch husband ruined everything. Husband? Wait... Dad... that-- That was you? Yeah. Your dad was a real asshole... You should be thanking me, really. You're fucking insane! You're sick! No! How about dedicated! And actually... I want to ask you something... What's your passcode? Go fuck yourself. Well I guess your right thumb will do. Oh, whoa! Where are you going? Katie! Come here, Katie... Come here, Katie... Come here... What? Die, motherfucker, die! Bitch! Fucking bitch! You remember my name now, huh? Fucker! I'll tell your mom you put up a good fight... Now you die. Fuck you! Told you I wouldn't let him hurt you. Thank you. Where did you learn to shoot like that? My grandpa. He taught your mom too, huh? Yeah. Let's get out of here. Katie! What happened? Where's Ashley? Katie... What happened? I'm sorry. Come here... What happened? No! No! No! Come on, come on. Help's on the way, okay? [line ringing] [Sidney] Hello? Hello? Mom?
