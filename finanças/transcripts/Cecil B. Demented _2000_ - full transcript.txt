I'd kill to meet her. Ohh, what a town. You know, I tell everybody in Hollywood... That if you want to shoot on location in Baltimore, you really don't need to bring a crew from Los Angeles. Because Baltimore really is best. And remember, miss whitlock... Is every inch a movie star, and she expects to be onstage at 7:10 P.M. exactly... In order to ensure live coverage... From each of the three local news shows. Oh, by the way, I hear she's really a nice person. Look at this dump of a town. Get me the fuck back to L.A.

And print it ! That's more like it, miss whitlock. Yeah ! Yeah ! But, you know, to be frank, Cecil-- I mean, in my real film life, I would never make this movie.

Let's move on. Well, wait a minute. No coverage ? The first take is the only real truth. But you can't cut a film with just a master. There are no rules in outlaw cinema, miss whitlock. Only edges.
