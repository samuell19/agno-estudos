[speaking in foreign language] - So I can't stay here. Too many memories. - Papa? - It's too expensive for one person. [speaking in foreign language] - [Rivka] Yes, but she only believed you. - Give me your jacket. - They don't mean it. - Of course they mean it. Give it to me. Here. I just stopped listening to them a long time ago. They're very smart, especially your mother, but what do they know of love, those two? You will see. So fast? - Kaddish. - [Josef] What about Kaddish? - Who taught you Kaddish? - No one taught me Kaddish. - Your father? - No, my father, my father was not a very good teacher. I listened. I listened to the old men in shul. - The words. - To tell the truth. I don't even know if I'm saying the right words. Okay. We've moved past on this-- - I want to go with you. - I can't go very far. - When you move. I want to go with you. - Oh. Papa sit. For subsidized housing, there are forms to fill out. There is list, waiting list. - Okay, you go. Always list. [soft music] - The rule of minyan is laid down in the Mishnah. David, read. [speaking in foreign language] - Because the Gemara states every act of sanctification requires at least 10 men. These are the rules. The rabbis found support for the rules in the Torah from a story in the book of Numbers. [speaking in foreign language] - David. Where are you, David? [speaking in foreign language] [boys laugh] Hashem is in the words, and the words are in the Torah! - It's not so hard, just tell them what they wanna hear. Whatever is in the book, it must be right even if it's wrong. David. David, God is in the word, David. [chuckles] - Give me that. Your grandfather looks thin. - He is thin, the same thin. - No, look closer. He's not getting enough to eat. Neither are you. - Neither am I. - And your mother, she likes new house? - It's okay. - That is all? She couldn't wait to get away. - It's only a few blocks away. - For her, that is enough, practically another country. - Practically another country. [train rumbling] - [Rachel] No, I won't have it. - What's wrong with normal school, regular high school? - David, please. - He knows already language. He can recite all the prayers. - Recite? What does this mean to recite? Like parrot? - If he wants to leave, he could leave. - [Rachel] Do you understand any of it? - Do you? - No, not a fucking word. But this is not about me. - At his age I was already working. - Take the money out of my salary. - [Simon] Did I say anything about money? - Take the money out of my salary. Not so easy as a few prayers in Hebrew, you will see. Do you remember school in Russia? - Yes. - Every morning-- - It's not so bad. - Every morning I sent you to school and every afternoon you came back with your books, muddy and ripped, and a little body was covered with bruises and welts. Maybe this was not so bad for you, but for a mother, there is no worse torture you can imagine. You cannot turn your back on education, chance to learn. - Public school is in education. - But in Jewish school, no one can beat you for being a Jew. [soft music] - Hello, my friend, come, get in. - We can wait. - Too cold for old man. - No, cost is-- - No cost. A mitzvah. Where are you going? [speaking in foreign language] - To Brighton Beach. [speaking in foreign language] - What about you? [soft music] - She would have made something special for you. - And for you. - No, this is all that I need. Your mother once asked your grandmother why she didn't leave Russia when she was young woman, before the war, during the war, - When she was waiting for you to come home? - Your mother always thought about this as if there were options. As if you can just run away from yourself. - What did Bubbe say? - Look into my eyes, that's what Bubbe said. So your mother looked in Bubbe's eyes since she didn't see anything. Exactly, said Bubbe, because I have nothing to hide. [phone rings] I'll get it, I'll get it. Hello? Yes, yes. Right. Okay, yes, thank you, thank you. Yeah. - Who was that? - This was an opportunity for apartment, but it didn't come through. Who is that? That is me. I don't know very well the man that was then. Grandmother had this photograph taken because she did not think that I would survive. Still, I don't. Memories no substitute for love. - You have no bills for today. And then we will see you again July 21st. Doctor, before you go, I have something, I'll have you sign right here. Thank you. - He can sleep in my room. I can sleep on the couch. - Your grandfather is a war war hero. He is proud and pious man. Besides, he cannot manage stairs. - You have to do something. He's just waiting there. - I'm already paying portion of his rent. [door buzzes] Don't tell him. The doesn't know this. And don't tell your father. Mr. Zeydenbaum, you know my son? - Hello. - We have some work to do. [soft music] [train rumbling] - One donut. Need a place to crash? - That's okay. They don't usually last that long. - Your mother knows what she's doing, huh. - Here you go, sir. [indistinct audio] [soft music] - [David] It's so much davening. So many rules. - I didn't have such an education. There were hardly any books. The fact that I can read Hebrew is a miracle enough. I was hoping that whatever you learned, that you would teach me. - What I learned? Doesn't really matter? The rabbi says you can eat an orange on Shabbos, but the peeling is labor. - What? What, perhaps I have eaten an orange on Shabbos. If that's what he said, I want to know it. - That's what's written. - David. Come here. The evening before his bar mitzvah, a boy runs up to a rabbi and says, rabbi, I am afraid. Rabbi says, it's only natural to be nervous [mumbles]. No, Rabbi. You don't understand. I am afraid. What are you afraid of? I am not yet certain that I believe in God. The rabbi gives the boy a big shake in the shoulders and he says. - What? You forget? - I am not yet certain that I believe in God. That's what rabbi says to boy. I am not yet certain. No one should force you, David. No one. - You know where you're going. You don't know what's going to happen. - [Boy] He's a pig fucker. [laughs] - You're scared, but you're, you're doing good, you're adrenalin is pumping, you know. [interposing voices speaking] And the waiting's the worst part, because you don't know-- - [Boy] Your stupid little friend back to Siberia. - My apologies, Mrs. Levitan. I will be right with you. You can go change. Yeah, your robe is there. Okay. [speaking in foreign language] Hello. [train rumbling] [siren blaring] [muffled music] - What can I get you? - Vodka. - [Bartender] You got ID? - Come on, can't you see the boy needs a drink. I mean, look at him. You know what, nevermind. I will have a vodka. On the rocks? No, neat. [muffled music] Okay, maybe on the young side of legal, but he drinks like one of us. Tell me, do you know the difference between the good stuff and the crap that he just poured you? - I'm a Russian. - Get them one from the top shelf then. [muffled rock music] - Sorry. [muffled rock music] - This is why we cannot find him apartment. That is three people who die in this apartment. - Don't say that. - I don't wish it. - Then don't say it. - Only that when he goes, he goes quickly. I have already spent too many nights sleeping on his floor. - The couch is worse. - Of course it was. This is why I slept on floor. [soft music] - Where have you been? I get call from school. Then from your father. What happened to you? Who did this to you? - I'll be here. - David. All the answers are in the book. Everything. It's all in the book. - My daughters tried everything, rabbi. Like there are no apartments. - Listen to what I'm telling you. You should speak to Zalman. He is the Gabbai. He's a good man. You should speak directly to him and give him this letter. - Rabbi. - The building has its own small synagogue inside. Not as grand as this one, but it doesn't matter. Zalman cannot draw a minyan for Shabbat, and if no minyan, it serious problem for him. People will go somewhere else. You are pious man. And you should be excellent attendant to this place. - Thank you, rabbi. - Okay. [speaking in foreign language] - Put this on. - Holocaust day is tomorrow. - Today you will take your grandfather to his appointment. - Today we have to set up the things. All the stuff has been in the basement since last year. It's only gonna get dirty. - Then don't touch anything. Make sure he wears his new suit also. And take bus. - It's not so far. He can walk. - If you walk, it will take forever. And he will find a way of talking himself out of the running along the way. This is what he does before he even gets there. He should not be breathless. If he has to pass selection process, he should seem healthy. Why would manager pick someone who looks to be on his death bed? He would have to go through process all over again. - Probably used to it by now. - Make sure he impresses this Zalman the high level of his religious commitment. He is more committed to God than to anyone else. I know this. You will see. And give the man this. This is finest Russian vodka. - He's Romanian. - Romanians don't drink? [group chatter] [soft music] [whistle blows] [soft music] [glass breaks] - You know you can't walk that far. It's not like the man's going anywhere. Where would he go? - David, I'm telling you, we should walk. This meeting is a waste of time. - You don't know that. - I do know that. It's a waste of time. [horn honks] - Here. - Besides, we have nothing to give him. Not even vodka. - What? What are you looking at me for? - I have ice. Here. - I'm fine. - Take. Take ice. [siren blaring] [singing in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] - Atheists. One is a product of Stalin, the other of Hitler. What do you say to a man that he asks where God was when the Germans were shooting his parents, throwing them into a hole? They teach you the answer to that in your Yeshiva? I didn't think so. But to here has it lost someone to the Nazis? And I lost my grandparents, three beautiful sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins. What am I supposed to do? My problem is one man. - He who saves one man saves the world. - One man. It's not enough to make the minyan here. I need two men. You must both come. Then I am sure I can make an apartment available to you. It may take a little time, even a few months, but what are a few months. In Brighton Beach. [singing in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] - Good man. I don't understand one fucking word of Hebrew but I thanks God it takes only one arm to pour, one arm to drink. So there is no disadvantage to my situation, except with the women. The women don't like it. But it takes only one hand to, your grandfather has all his parts. - Uh huh. - Gut Shabbos. [bell rings] [speaking in foreign language] - How did you know? [speaking in foreign language] [coughing] - He will accept no help. Once a soldier, always a solider. - Gut Shabbos. - Gut Shabbos. [speaking in foreign language] Or the stories of Peretz? - Peretz? - Peretz. Babel, everyone loves Babel. Itzik has a real voice for it, but he loses his breath nowadays. My voice is not so entertaining, but we are always glad for the company. You are invited as well. - It was at this moment precisely that he found he could not rise. Something had happened to his arms, his legs, his feet. He began to scream in his great bewildered terror and felt himself indeed begin to move. Not upwards towards the light, but down again, a sickness in his bowels, a tightening of his loin strings. He felt himself turning again and again across the dusty floor and though God's toe had touched him lightly. [group chatter] - Where'd you come from? - I don't know, it's a, it's a long story. - You talk, that's a start. Tell me later. [group chatter] [speaking in foreign language] - It's very nice. Comfortable. Still, I prefer the old one. It fit in better. But tell me, how did you get this upstairs? Furniture's not supposed to go through the lobby. - Your neighbors. - Ver? - You know, the soldier and the poet. They said it would be okay. - The two men who live next door, they've were neighbors in the building where they lived before. Their wives had been friends. Herschel's wife survived the war in a cellar. In Poland, I believe. A few years ago, Itzik's wife died and they put themselves on the list for the subsidized housing. - So you boys will stay for dinner? - I only made for two. - They work so hard. - We'll make due. - okay. A short time after Itzik's wife died, Herschel's wife also died. And he put himself on the same list. He's the small one. Itzik had suitcases full of cash, I'm told. And a son in Chicago who is very successful. So for him there was no urgency. But for Herschel, he's an intellectual, you know. What value is fancy ideas and pretty words if you have only a few coins in your pocket? Without his wife's government check, Herschel could not afford where he was to live. So he moved in to Itzik's apartment. - It's a mitzvah? [speaking in foreign language] Who's helping who? [speaking in foreign language] - But Itzik, his name came up first on the list. - Have you been to their apartment yet? - No, not yet. Herschel extended many invitations, but-- - And? - Well, there was always something that needed to be done. - Done? What needed to be done? - The food is delicious. - Yes. It's very tasty. - Yes. - So Nathan, how's your mother? - She's not talking to me. I told her I was joining the army. The IDF. - [Mrs. Greenberg] She wanted you to be a soldier, she could have moved to Israel to begin with. [soft music] - This way's nice. [soft music] - [David] You're crazy. [soft music] Who talked you into this? The Yeshiva? - Do you remember the airplane? When the plane took off, when we're over the clouds, over the ocean, I thought it was gonna be like that here. When we got here. But it's just this. Only this. [soft music] - And then you come back, right? [soft music] [slow suspenseful music] [speaking in foreign language] [singing in foreign language] [coughing] [singing in foreign language] - You, young person. Get me some water. The devil has me by the throat. [coughing] - How tall are you? - Oh, look, the workman has arrived. - He is joking with you. This is how he jokes. - When you are done moving the light, you could take a look at the toilet. - Itzik would have done, but it is not a good idea now, now that he is not feeling so well. Oh what wonders. When you can do something, it takes only a minute. And when you can't, you stay in the dark forever. - Do you want me to fix the toilet? - You are a plumber too? [chuckles] My brother, he was strong like you, but not as big. In the shtetl, there was not so much nutrition in cabbage. He was a fighter when it was not a good idea to be one. In our town, it was a blacksmith. A pole. He had arms like legs. For fun, he'd crack my skull with his hammer. My brother, he broke that Pole's arm as if it were a birch branch. - I'm not that strong. - [Herschel] We surprise ourselves. - Where's your brother now? - You smell like a real Russian. Worse. It's a good smell. In the army, we all slept together in a pile. Heads buried in the warm parts of another man's body. Our commander would find us like that every morning. Get up. Get up, he would kick us and then make us march. That way he could tell who would live and who would die. He looked to see if there was still life left in our legs. - Such a man. A real Odessa character right out of the pages of Babel. Do you know Babel? - Not really. - What a writer. - The wisdom of my grandfather sat in my head. We are born for the pleasure of work, fighting, love. We are born for that and nothing else. - For that and nothing else. Here. You will enjoy it. Itzik grew up on Babel Street. - Really? - When I was your age, I was already [coughing]. - You like the fights? Itzik knows all Ukrainian fighters. - My father was a boxing coach in Russia at the local clubs, but he trained many of the champions when they were first starting out. - But once they started winning, they take them away, give them to other coaches. - Yes. So now he's a physical therapist. - He gives a massage. - To lots of middle-aged women. - He likes that? [chuckles] - My brother, for him, my survival was the reason he had to survive. Many were the times when he might've been able to get away to slip through the holes. I know this now. He was strong. They were ways. But he stayed for me. Hmm. When the ghetto was being liquidated, we were put on a train. He pushed us towards the big door where there was more air and a chance for water. And when the big door opened, he must have been able make deals with the kappos so that he and I would be selected for work and not the showers. Or maybe it was only luck. My mind is full of tricks now. I don't know how we survived, or why, except whenever I was hungry he found food, whenever I was cold, he wrapped me in his arms. [singing in foreign language] Being alone was also a cause of death in and of itself.

That's mine. - You bring a lot of books in the club. - [David] I wasn't really planning on going out. - It just ind of happened? - [David] Yes. - What about the time before that? What was that? A rehearsal? - I didn't know what was inside. - You can crash here for a while. - [David] I don't think I can sleep. - [Bruno] Then read. - I saw you reading this. - Hmm? - At the bar that other day, you were reading it. That tickles. [groaning] [pleasureful moaning] - He smiled up at Elisha, and his tears ran down. And sister McCandless began to sing, Lord I ain't no stranger now. - She's singing. Keep reading. - Rise up Johnny, said Elisha again. Are you saved boy? Yes, Said John. Oh yes, and the words came upward it seemed to themselves in the new voice God had given him. - [Teacher] What does Baldwin mean by all this? - About being saved, you know, like born again. - I don't think he's been saved. - What do you mean? - John knows he has to talk about being saved with his father but the music he hears in his ear is what he feels inside as a secret still, that he isn't a stranger to himself anymore. He can see inside himself. - Revelations. - See you guys later. So smart all of a sudden - Just really liked the book a lot. - That part where his brother gets in a fight. - Ah, so vivid. - I can't stop thinking about it. And when he picks up his little sister and tells her-- - Tells her to escape and. [soft music] She was a dentist where we lived. A lot of good Soviet, you know, bureaucrats were her patients. They didn't want her to leave, so when we did leave, they took all of her documents, her license, her diplomas. - That sucks. - It wouldn't have really mattered. She had to pass all the tests again here anyway. So she took this job. - [Alicia] As a receptionist. - [David] After the dentist leaves, she sees patients of her own. [soft music] - Shiksa. I've been waiting your whole life to use these words. Goyte. Sheygetz. Shiksa. [laughs] [pleasureful moaning] [laughs] - Are these your boyfriends? - [Bruno] Come on, sit down. - Who are they? - People. Men. Men I know. - I'm Jewish. Why the list? - Stop it. - Why? - You don't understand? Do you know anything? When someone gets sick, I write his name down and then he gets sicker, and then he dies. [soft music] - I'm here, I'm sorry. You don't need them, I'm here. [soft music] [singing in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [singing in foreign language] - Itzik loved donuts. Now he can hardly eat a single one. [bell rings] [muffled speaking] - Still, it's wonderful that Itzik's son has returned. No matter what happens, in the end, a father is a father, and the son is a son. - You and your wife never had any children? - No. The war, after the war, there were two kinds of people. There were those who felt such a responsibility to ensure the future of the Jewish people. And then there were people like my wife, people who were convinced that the world itself was irrefutably evil. These were the two kinds. I was neither one or the other. For me, if joy exists in the world, then joy certainly exists even if you don't have children. - After the war, there was only one kind of people, the kind that lived. She was one of the lucky ones. - She did not think so. [muffled speaking] Her father had a good business tanning leather in his village. He made plans with the Polish man who owned the other tannery. He offered him all his inventory, all his tools, if that man would hide them. - The kindness of strangers. - They were not strangers. They were neighbors. When the time came, the man said it was impossible to hide a whole family. Only the little girl, my wife, could stay in the attic. - So she didn't see them again? - That men visited her many times in attic. Sometimes he even let her out at night after his wife fell asleep. - [Man] Go ahead, choke yourself to death [mumbles]. [soft music] - This is true story. You must never tell your parents this because I will go to prison. - [Woman] I want to meet your parents. - Anyway, look at this girl. Look how beautiful this girl is. She's so beautiful. I was so happy. I can tell this story in front of David. I was laughing so hard. Not as hard as the time they came to dentist office and I gave them laughing gas. Do you want drink? - Sure, thank you. - David, get us drink. Get us drink. Ridiculous. [women laughing] [train rumbling] [rock music] - He is handsome, I will give you that. Slightly mean way. ♪ People like us Was it the book? You think he's smart too? [laughs] You think he actually reads? [rock music] We all have our props. These little things. He's not worth it. You'll understand some day. Still wet behind the ears. [rock music] The good ones are all gone anyway. Most of 'em. [rock music] [muffled music] - Go home, David. [muffled music] - What did I do? - Just go home. [soft music] [Herschel sobbing] [soft music] - You don't have to do that now. - Itzik's son is coming tomorrow. I don't want there to be any fighting. In Auschwitz, there were small mountains of shoes. Shoes that had walked countless miles in untold humiliations. What was the value in these shoes? Shoes without soles? The Jews, they buried in ditches, and turned into ash, but the shoes, the German's wanted to keep. - Can I do anything? - Yes. I do think that that Itzik would have wanted his son to have this. Perhaps he, perhaps he didn't want me to see it either. - I liked her. She's a very nice girl. Alicia, Alicia, - Alicia. - Stop saying her name like that. - Like what? - Like she's-- - Her father is very successful business man. - He sells cars. - He has car dealerships on Long Island that he owns. - What is their home like? - I don't-- - Big house, I'm sure. - I haven't been. - [Rachel] Go there, meet her parents. - Listen to you. - What, I should not like her? Her father can be big help for you too. - Really, there's no point in talking about this. - Okay, okay. Okay, I like her too. She's very pretty girl. - Think so? - Yes [soft orchestral music] [speaking in foreign language] - Itzik was an unusual man. What sort of life he had in Odessa, I cannot say in the slightest. He came to this country already an older man, and then became successful in the transport business. He supported his family. He made jobs for other immigrants, helped them get on their feet. Only in his last few years did he rediscover Judaism. But then he never missed a Shabbat prayer, Shabbat service. And he gave generously to our community. He was a man of few words. So perhaps few words need to be spoken. But is there anyone here who would want to say anything more about Itzik? If someone has something to say and sit in silence, they will feel regret. - Living a long life is a blessing. Today it is a curse. Itzik was my last, my dearest friend. Every word that he said, he meant. He liked to listen to me read. He understood only a few words of Hebrew but all of the prayers were like music in his ears. As a father has mercy on his sons, so the Lord has mercy on those who fear him. For he knows our devisings. Recalls that we are dust. Men's days are like grass, like the bloom of the field thus he blooms. When wind passes over him, he is gone, and his place will no longer remember him. But the Lord's kindness is for ever and ever over those who fear Him. These were the words of David. King David. [speaking in foreign language] - Thank you for helping to bury my father. Look at them. Who knows how many they have robbed and cheated and screwed. He spent seven years in jail, my father. Did you know that? - I have half brothers and sisters all over Russia. I don't know how many. For him, nothing was forbidden. That was my father, you understand. He was like this. Like this. - How very kind of you. A mitzvah. - It's nothing. - Itzik always said how pretty you were. Always very well made up. - I am so sorry. [speaking in foreign language] - David. - You must make her stop. - Well, I thought it was very nice that she brought some food. She's already trying to put him out on the street. - What to expect from old Jews, David? - Better. You can expect better. - Old people are no better than the children. David, everyone knows someone who's on the waiting list. So not to act with guarantee that someone with less scruples will succeed in getting Itzik's apartment. - Where did you learn this, the Torah? - No, David. I learned it in life. - Zalman. - Zalman. Zalman will do what Zalman does. - Let him sit shiva. - Listen, my bother-in-law's a good Jew. And his Hebrew is excellent. You will see. And he has a grandson. A good yeshiva boy. [somber music] - Examine all of it. Travel your road again and tell the truth about it. Sing it or shout or testifying or keep it to yourself. But know whence it came. [bell rings] - You okay? - Something for you. [soft music] [singing in foreign language] [group chatter] - And I think if she comes-- - Her mother was married to-- [group chatter] - Light the first light of evening as in a room in which we rest, and for small reason, think the world imagined is the ultimate good. This is therefore the intensivist rendezvous. It is in that thought that we collect ourselves out of all the indifferences into one thing within a single thing, a single shawl wrapped tightly around us. Since we are poor, a warmth, a light, a power, the miraculous influence here, now. We forget each other and ourselves. We feel the obscurity of an order, a whole, a knowledge that which arranged the rendezvous within its vital boundary in the mind. We say God and the imagination are one. How high the highest candle lights the dark. Out of this same light, out of the central mind, we make a dwelling in the evening air in which being there together is enough. - [Herschel] Is enough. - Come my friend. Let me give you a ride. You're studying? - Herschel gave them to me. - Gave? [speaking in foreign language] How is he doing? - He's losing his apartment. - No? It cannot be. I knew Itzik for many years, when he was still married. He was a good man. Good looking too. For a boss, not too demanding. I've wanted to be a nurse. Itzik never complained when I asked him to study or to take exam. He let me keep driving after, some test I passed flying colors. But, other test I cannot pass now. - So many books. You will be reading long time. - I like reading. - I can see that. But can you make life? Wife? - A living? - Okay. - I don't know. You'd rather I sell cars? - I wanted to be doctor a long time ago. I was smartest girl in my class. Your grandfather suggested I become dentist. He was told I would never be accepted to medical school. My mother, she wanted me to be married, like this would solve all my worries. Does your father know about this? All of this? [soft music] [singing in foreign language] - David, is your grandfather all right? - Yes. Yes he's okay. - Then what can I do for you? - Not for me. I didn't come from me. I need to speak to you about Herschel. I know the people in the building are talking about him. - Yes, of course they talk about him. - Ms. Greenberg-- - [Zalman] And your grandfather. They have become close, intimate. I told you what this place would be good for him. - No. Ms. Greenberg, that one-arm Russian, they have their sites on Herschel's apartment. - [Zalman] It was Itzik's apartment. - People keep saying that. - It was his name on the lease and mine, as witness. - Herschel lives there. He's lived there for, have you been to their apartment? - Why should I have gone there? I was never invited. - [David] There's almost nothing left. - I understand Itzik's son took most of the furnishings. - Everything. He took everything except the books. - I imagined the books would be Herschel's. - Yes, and even those he's giving away. - He was always generous. He's a smart man. A teacher. - Meanwhile, all the neighbors are scheming to have their relative, skip to the top of the list that they can take his apartment. - Just as you and your grandfather did not too long ago. - Aren't you worried about him? - About Herschel? - Yes, goddamn it! He has nothing. He's all alone. - He has you. You are here on his behalf, aren't you? - He doesn't know that I'm here. He believes God will watch out for him. - Don't you? - Shabbat begins-- - Please. You can't throw him out. - David. - No. You know what he's been through. You know what he survived. - Yes.
