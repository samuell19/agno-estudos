[tape recorder clicks] [Epstein] Look, if there's something we can do to minimize Ghislaine's involvement, I'd appreciate it because there's nothing... It's... it's just unfair because she... she really plays no role. And Ghislaine was never... never ever a part of any of this stuff. It turned out not to be, you know, truthful that she was involved in procuring women. The whole thing's ridiculous. I... I'm willing to take the heat for, you know, the situation I've been involved in. She's already fragile. You know, to bring innocent people in simply because she's well-known, I... I just think is unfair, and I'm telling you, it's defamatory. And it's bullshit. [suspenseful music playing] Speculation has abounded for several days as to the whereabouts of Ghislaine Maxwell. [man 1] After Jeffrey Epstein's death, the inevitable question was, "When is Ghislaine gonna be arrested?" [reporter 1] Maxwell has been accused of recruiting underage girls to act as sex slaves for Epstein and other men. [woman 1] She's accused of being not only a coconspirator but also an abuser herself. [man 2] All our friends who'd known her at the time were like, "Where the hell is Ghislaine?" [airplane engine roaring] Maxwell, who is allegedly now under a new FBI investigation, is in hiding. [woman 2] Ghislaine Maxwell has multiple citizenships. She could flee to a country where we could no longer prosecute her. [reporter 2] It's been nearly half a year since Epstein's death, and Ghislaine Maxwell is still nowhere to be found. [woman 3] I was thinking in my head, "Well, she better stay hidden, because they are gonna just destroy her." [man 3] Ghislaine Maxwell was hiding from the public. She was hiding from the press. She was hiding from authorities. She was hoping that everybody would forget about it. Clearly, that didn't work. [suspenseful music fading] [reporter 3] Authorities have been searching for Ghislaine Maxwell. At 8:30 this morning, they found her here, in New Hampshire. [woman 4] It was an aggressive raid. And she ran into the other room. They found that she was trying to hide her location by putting tinfoil on her cell phone. She clearly did not want to be found. [woman 5] Today, we announce charges against Ghislaine Maxwell for helping Jeffrey Epstein sexually exploit and abuse multiple minor girls. I firmly believe that she didn't think she was doing anything wrong. [unsettling music playing] Now the question is, was it fate? Was it always going to happen? Or was there that point where she could've gone down a different road? [reporter 4] If convicted on all counts, the 58-year-old Maxwell could face up to 35 years in prison. [woman 6] And now that Ghislaine has been arrested, the more important question is, will power and money stand in the way of justice once again, the way it has so many times before in this twisted story? [suspenseful music fading] [tranquil music playing] [woman] I'm a survivor of the abuse at the hands of Maxwell and Epstein. And I'm going to be testifying in her upcoming trial. I met Maxwell and Epstein when I was just 16 years old through my sister, Maria Farmer. We were both abused by Maxwell and Epstein in separate instances in the '90s. We reported it to the authorities, and nothing was done. My sister went to the FBI in 1996 and told them. We both talked to reporters in 2002. Come on. Then, we talked to the FBI in 2006, but still, nothing was done. And then in 2019, I was so hopeful that we would finally get accountability. Fox News has learned that billionaire Jeffrey Epstein has been charged by federal prosecutors with sex trafficking. [man] Epstein is charged in a two-count indictment. First, conspiracy to commit sex trafficking and second, the substantive crime of sex trafficking of underage girls. [Annie Farmer] We were finally hoping to get justice, but then my husband woke me up early in the morning with the news of what happened. And I felt sick to my stomach. [reporter] We do want to start here with breaking news right now. Sources telling ABC News that accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein has died by suicide. [male anchor] Epstein's accusers are furious tonight, saying he won't have to face justice while they have to live with their scars for the rest of their lives. [birds chirping] [Annie Farmer] It was the summer of 2020, and it had been some time since Epstein had... had died. I woke up the morning of my birthday to a phone call very early that I was not expecting, and I saw that it was Sigrid calling me. Sigrid McCawley and David Boies are my attorneys, and I've worked with them for several years to pursue justice against Epstein and Maxwell. When I answered the phone, Sigrid told me that Maxwell had just been arrested and that I was one of the women that had been included in the charges against her. [McCawley] I've been working with victims of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell for about seven years now. What's so incredible about Annie's story is that she started telling it decades ago, and finally, now, Ghislaine Maxwell is being tried for those crimes. - Hi, David. - Hi. [Boies] The Maxwell and Epstein sex-trafficking enterprise is a good illustration of how slow society moves and how slow the justice system moves. This is, finally, an opportunity for vindication for the survivors. The current criminal case against Ghislaine has three victims, all underage victims. [McCawley] Two of whom are not public, and one of whom is Annie Farmer. [Annie Farmer] I chose to use my name at the trial because I had been working already to bring attention to what had happened in this case. And I was just highlighting the indictment... [Annie Farmer] David and Sigrid are helping me to know what's coming and to help me think about how to clearly present my story. I think we see, you know, the indictment, there's a lot in here that's, uh, really critical to her story. I think what I was taken by was the focus on grooming. - [Boies] Yeah. - The grooming was such a big piece of what she went through and how they lured her into this. Annie presents incredibly well. She has a degree in psychology, a doctorate. And frankly, the consistency of her story over many, many years. At the trial, I expect that they're gonna get into the details of what happened to her. I think they're gonna pick it apart quite a bit. And I think being put on the stand and being cross-examined by these really ferocious lawyers is gonna be hard. [Boies] She's a wonderfully strong, articulate young woman, but she's not an experienced witness. And we're gonna have to be sure that she knows the kind of questions that Maxwell's attorneys are gonna ask on cross-examination. [Annie Farmer] This process of waiting to get to trial is hard, because on the one hand, I'm dreading testifying... Come on. ...and on the other hand, I'm really ready to close this chapter of my life and move on to other things. Yeah, your sister's nervous. [pensive music playing] [man] I've been fighting for justice on behalf of now more than 65 of Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein's victims for over 13 years. I represent one of three victims that is going to be called to testify in the Maxwell trial. My client is gonna proceed under the pseudonym "Kate," as this case has international attention, and she has a young daughter. She wants to be protective of her. She wants to be protective of her own privacy. And she feels that it's very important to bring Ghislaine Maxwell to justice, as do I. [somber music playing] [Edwards] After accumulating 100 banker's boxes of material, this is just a small fraction of the information that we compiled regarding Ghislaine Maxwell's whereabouts at certain times. Photographs, witness statements, police reports, timelines, spiderwebs of victims, all of the evidence that showed direct interaction between the victims and Ghislaine Maxwell. The identical evidence that the prosecutors are gonna show the jury in the upcoming trial against Ghislaine Maxwell. My best guesstimate, just based on everything that I know, is that Jeffrey Epstein accumulated more than 500 victims. At this point, I think Jeffrey Epstein is the undisputed, most prolific sexual predator of all time. But without Ghislaine's help, he could never have pulled off such an elaborate scheme and abused so many. She fed a monster. You have to kind of be a monster to do it. Jeffrey Epstein is molesting hundreds and hundreds of girls from the time that Ghislaine meets him until he's arrested. And yet, the only trial that's going to happen related to the sex trafficking is against Ghislaine. My law partner, Brittany Henderson, David Boies, Sigrid McCawley, and I have worked for years to put this puzzle together. Even though we represent different clients, we have a united front and are now helping the prosecutors to make sure they put the strongest case forward. Four sex-trafficking charges. And now there's a lot of work to be done. The victims and witnesses are gonna be ready. They've always been ready. I think the strongest arguments for the prosecution are really the voices of these young women. I think the biggest challenge is that Ghislaine Maxwell is very effective at presenting herself incredibly well. She is well-educated. She comes across as a very sophisticated woman, which gives people comfort because they assume that somebody of that stature is, of course, not going to be somebody that they would envision as being an abuser. [somber music playing] [upbeat synth music playing] [car horns blaring] [upbeat synth music continues] [man 1] I met Ghislaine in November 1989. At the time, she was visiting from London. I was going to a nightclub and having dinner with some friends, who had been at Oxford with Ghislaine. She was the life of every party, knew absolutely everyone, extremely popular, vivacious personality. I remember Ghislaine told a lot of very funny, dirty jokes. That night, I went home and wrote in my diary, "Met Ghislaine Maxwell, hilarious sense of humor, incredibly good fun, and she's just a really live wire, and I hope I get to see her again." [camera shutter clicks] [man 2] I met Ghislaine in New York, and we had a fair number of friends in common. A couple of people I knew had dated her. And she was a connector. She was gregarious and quite glamorous and a bit raunchy and quite wild. And made more interesting by the fact that her father was this rather notorious business figure, Robert Maxwell. [Robert Maxwell] Captain, you might come and take this bag from my secretary. [Mason] Robert Maxwell was this larger-than-life character. Notorious press baron, a wheeler-dealer, and just a monstrous ego, a kind of successful scoundrel. [Rellie] Her father had set her up in this life which allowed her to be, you know, at the fulcrum of New York society. She was, you know, like the sparkling debutante or something. So, the bottom picture, uh, we were at an event in, um, Los Angeles. And I'm in, like, my early twenties. And yeah, we were having, like, a lot of fun back then. Yeah, she was definitely, like, a kind of flirtatious character, for sure. She exuded this mysterious air about her. Like, you never knew, like, which tropical location she'd just jetted in from. She was like a... a Bond character. She never stayed in one place very long. She didn't really even need to be a social climber, because she already was at the top because of her father. She knew everyone. And these people were, like, running countries or were, like, famous musicians, or... You know, she... she knew, like, the very top percentage of the people that basically rule the world. Could she read a room? Yeah, for sure, definitely. She knew exactly, like, if she was going to an event, who was gonna be there. And she would've scoped it out, and she would know all about them and who she's gonna spend time on. On the scale of shark, she'd probably be a great white shark. [somber music playing] [woman 1] She's never been really sensitive to the feelings of others. She had no boundaries. She was overtly sexual but more as an arranger and a teacher. And I remember one party, Ghislaine, who I hadn't seen for a while, sort of appears from nowhere, grabs my hand, and suddenly suggests that she gives me a lesson in the art of performing oral sex. Um... I was absolutely flabbergasted. She would encourage girls at parties to flirt with the men there and do even more than flirt. I mean, literally, to go to bed with them. [woman 2] I remember meeting Ghislaine for the first time at Headington Hill Hall, the family home of the Maxwells, and being very struck by how beautiful she was. Um, she was just delightful. [Mozart's "Turkish March" playing] I was there for a dinner party, and I don't remember anybody else in the family being there. Ghislaine was 29 at the time, and most of the people there seemed to be around that age or slightly older, in their mid-thirties. We had a very nice meal. There was a lot of laughter. Then Ghislaine stood up and disappeared. She came back with a handful of scarves and then sort of, you know, demanded everybody's attention and then described the game. And the game involved blindfolding the men with these scarves. And then she explained the women would take off their tops and bras and would parade before the men, and the men would then be able to fondle the breasts and would then attempt to identify to whom the breasts belonged, relative to the other women in the room. This was my idea of, uh... the... the ultimate nightmare. [people laughing] [Glucksmann] I just remember feeling incredibly shocked and immediately started working on my escape plan. But it's haunted me ever since. The women had no power, and the men were being invited by a woman to be assaulted. [despondent music playing] [camera shutter clicking] [Wyatt] Ghislaine Maxwell grew up with sexism. Her father believed that women were basically there for men's pleasure and convenience. He really did view women as objects. I met Robert Maxwell for the first time at my father's house, and I remember noticing that his wife, Betty, was like a sort of poor dormouse. She hardly said a word. Maxwell immediately started to flirt with my mother and then flirt with me, which is something he did a lot. He treated his wife badly. He was unfaithful to his wife. [Hervey] I think the fact that her mother stayed with her father, even though he had, like, multiple affairs, I think that probably did have an effect on her. She probably, like, in her head thought that that was normal. [Rellie] But still, she was desperately, desperately fond of her dad. Ghislaine doted on her father and vice versa. [indistinct chatter] [Wyatt] Robert Maxwell used to go around with Ghislaine as a kind of mascot. It... it was an odd relationship because it was more like a kind of man-and-his-lover relationship. I don't mean in a physical sense, but he was very proud of her figure and the fact that she was attractive and glamorous, and he liked having her on his arm. In a rather unhealthy way, he was her anchor and ballast. [foreboding music playing] [waves crashing] [board member] The board of Mirror Group Newspapers announces with deep regret that Robert Maxwell, chairman of Mirror Group Newspapers, PLC and Maxwell Communication Corporation, is missing at sea. [Dan Rather] Maxwell was last seen before dawn off the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Hours later, searchers found his body. [Mason] His death was big news. And it was this big mystery. Had he been murdered? Had he just fallen off his yacht? - [reporters clamoring] - [cameras clicking] [Mason] Ghislaine seemed utterly devastated by her father's death. [Ghislaine Maxwell] I want to take this opportunity to thank all the many hundreds of people who have sent messages of support to us at this very, very sad time. [Wyatt] I think without him, she was like somebody who'd been chucked into the sea without a life belt. [Mason] The news of his death was followed very shortly thereafter by these revelations that he had plundered the pension plans of his workers. [man] The scandal was so big that it would have been very difficult for her to continue existing in London. And I think that she really had to move away. [tense music playing] [Mason] I remember visiting her in her apartment on the Upper East Side, and she was suddenly out of money. Robert Maxwell had left his family in the lurch. It was as if she was sort of bravely weathering this challenge of, you know, the mysterious death of her beloved father. [Ghislaine Maxwell] I'm extremely sad that my father is no longer here, but I don't feel in any way smaller or lesser than what I was before. The future is the future. You just get on and do whatever you can do. If I have a wish for myself, it's to do something positive with my life. And she veered towards a replacement Robert Maxwell, a bombastic man who was also very, very rich and had many of the traits of her father, and he was called Jeffrey Epstein. [unsettling music playing] [car horns blaring] [reporter 1] Ghislaine Maxwell is facing new federal charges of child sex trafficking. The new indictment adds a fourth alleged victim. Prosecutors accusing her of trafficking a 14-year-old girl in the early 2000s. [reporter 2] This is on top of six charges Maxwell was already facing tied to Epstein's alleged sex-trafficking network. [reporter 3] It could be effectively a life sentence for her if she's convicted and given the maximum here. [Boies] The newest victim that's been added to the criminal indictment lays out how Maxwell got her to try to solicit other people to join the sex-trafficking, uh, enterprise. So this takes the indictment to another level. - [cameras clicking] - [man chatter indistinctly] [McCawley] I always say, in this case, truth is stranger than fiction. So, I think it's really hard for people to understand the vast depth of the trafficking that occurred, and that's so unnatural to so many people. So, I think people are fascinated with it for those reasons. [somber music playing] After the hearing was over, Ghislaine stood up, she stood around her attorneys, and I saw her look over to her sister who was waiting in the gallery, and, um, she tapped her eye, and she also waved at her, and that was the first time we've seen one of Ghislaine's relatives appear before the court in support of her. [woman] Does she look okay to you? [man] Ghislaine is in very, very, very difficult conditions, conditions none of us would wish on our worst enemies. I've never seen anything like it, how she's being treated. It's the "Epstein Effect." [somber music playing] [brooding music playing] [Mason] The first time I remember hearing about Jeffrey Epstein was, Ghislaine invited me to a party she was giving for her mother in New York, and she explained that it was at the house of this guy she was dating, Jeffrey Epstein. [pensive music playing] [Rellie] When I first met Jeffrey Epstein, I thought he was a wildly successful investment banker-turned-money manager, for whom everything in the world, you know, had fallen into his lap. [Mason] The story Ghislaine told over and over again was that you didn't have a chance of Jeffrey taking you on as a client if you had less than a billion dollars to invest. That was part of the mystique of the man that Ghislaine was dating. [Rellie] So, I remember thinking, "He's clearly talented, successful, well-dressed, handsome, but he made extraordinarily little effort, frankly, as a host." It was an odd dichotomy between the two of them, with Ghislaine flitting around, making everybody comfortable, getting drinks, champagne, whatever you wanted. Ghislaine, kind of, orchestrating the waiters bringing people snacks and so on. [indistinct chatter] Have you got drinks? [Wyatt] She knew how to be a hostess in a grand, old-fashioned way, and I think somebody like Epstein, um, who was very much new money, was attracted to this, 'cause he probably saw her as upper-class English accent, been to Oxford, you know, wears designer clothes, has lots of well-known friends. [pops] Suddenly, they were seen together at all these smart parties, all the expensive parties, seemingly as a couple. She seemed genuinely deeply in love with him. [Rellie] She would be quite touchy-feely with him. She'd touch his elbow or touch his shoulder. And they seemed intimate. Whenever you saw Ghislaine, it was, "Jeffrey this and Jeffrey that," and all she spoke about was him. You got this feeling that she was just, like, so loyal to him. I met Ghislaine Maxwell in the fall of 1994 while I was a senior at the Fashion Institute of Technology. At the time, I was 21. I worked at Henri Bendel. One day, while I was working, Ghislaine came into the store. When she told me her name, I remember I was... I couldn't figure out how you would spell that. And I said, "That sounds like a French spelling of 'gasoline.'" And she laughed at me, and she said, "My boyfriend thinks I'm a lot like gasoline." "He's a match, and I'm gasoline." And we laughed over that. And I helped her shop. And she picked out things, and we continued the conversation. It was... easy to talk to her. I felt like I had met a friend in Ghislaine that I could trust. I felt safe. So when we wrapped up the transaction, she let me know that she wanted me to deliver her packages that evening at a hotel that was close by. When I arrived, the concierge escorted me into the bar, where I met Ghislaine and, ultimately, Jeffrey Epstein. If I thought Ghislaine was electrifying, Jeffrey was... on fire. They explained to me that the residence was undergoing renovations at that time, and they asked me if I would come up to their room to deliver the packages. [elevator dings] We went up to the room, and we were just having normal conversation. At one point, Jeffrey got up and went into the bathroom, and Ghislaine followed him. Jeffrey and Ghislaine both came out in bathrobes. For the most part, it was pretty light-hearted, until it wasn't. The tone of everything changed in a moment. They started talking about relationships between men and women, and they started to kiss each other in front of me. As Ghislaine and Jeffrey started to become increasingly intimate, I was sitting across from them, watching, and I was in shock. I was completely taken aback. I thought I was there in a professional capacity, and I really didn't know how to react. Ghislaine encouraged me to join, and Ghislaine started to instruct me, kind of as a big sister, about what he liked and how she pleased him, and the alarm bells in me were going off. Ghislaine was insistent that I participate, and I was scared that this was going to potentially turn into an assault. And it did turn into an assault. I was visibly freaked out and not wanting to participate. And, as soon as I could, I backed away. I reminded Ghislaine that my boyfriend was coming in for the weekend, and that's how I got out of the hotel room that evening. - [grim music playing] - [footsteps receding rapidly] [indistinct chatter] [Rellie] We used to gossip about Jeffrey and Ghislaine to try and make sense of this slightly odd relationship. It was a rather strange mixture of facets. [Wyatt] I mean, it wasn't a normal relationship, but it was the kind of relationship she obviously needed. She couldn't feel secure without money. And he was a good catch for her financially. They became totally dependent on each other in a weird way. [Couturier] As far as Jeffrey Epstein was concerned, there was something that... that sort of reeked of vice. [somber music playing] I mean, it's not that we were all saints. You know, we all did things that we shouldn't have done. But there was something that was... charged in negativity in him, which few people that I met had. [Rellie] He could be quite dismissive towards Ghislaine. There was a darkness about the whole thing. [Couturier] And actually, the funny thing is, is that he owed her all these entries into society that he might not have had otherwise. You know, like royalty. [woman] Ghislaine's connection to the Royal Family really dates back to her father, Robert Maxwell, who knew the Queen of England. Ghislaine Maxwell met Prince Andrew while she was studying at Oxford. And because of her father's business ties, she was already running around in circles with Royals. - [faint laughter] - [indistinct chatter] [Rellie] Sometime in the late '90s, Ghislaine said, "My old friend Andrew's in town." "Will you come for dinner?" I said, "Of course. I'd love to. Thank you." And I remember Prince Andrew being distinctly bored by the whole thing. And it was almost, sort of, competitive between, uh, Epstein and Prince Andrew as to who could seem more haughty and bored and... and disdainful of the whole event. I remember Andrew cheering up a tiny bit when there was a younger female sitting and talking to him and otherwise having practically no interest in anything else or anyone else. It was a sort of unhealthy scene. [grim music playing] [Mason] The story I started hearing was that apparently... Jeffrey Epstein kind of likes younger women and that he kind of likes, um... schoolgirls, um, uh... and that Ghislaine introduces him to girls because that's... He... That's his thing. [somber music playing] And people were speculating that Ghislaine was hanging out with seniors at a very fancy private girls school on the Upper East Side and that she was introducing these girls to Jeffrey. Just seemed deeply weird. Why would Ghislaine be dating a guy who liked younger women? [Rellie] Girls I knew had talked about being invited for tea, and they didn't always want to talk more than that. So, I got the sense, at the time, that there was something... a bit strange. [Mason] In retrospect, it seems so horrific to think that we were hearing about this, and we weren't outraged. But honestly, it just seemed like... flirtation. But what the hell was I thinking? What were we all thinking? [cars honking] In 1997, Ghislaine had contacted me and asked me to meet her at her apartment. [grim music playing] [elevator dings] [Oxenberg] She started off very confident, saying, "I'm going to change your life." "I'm gonna give you a lot of money, and you're gonna meet everyone." And then she asked me to help her write her book. She says, "I want you to live with me for a full year so you can learn everything about me." She's staring out the window somewhat dramatically. She says, "You have to write this book for me." She says, "Because I want Jeffrey to marry me." And she says, "I need for Jeffrey to see me in a more elevated light, and I believe that with this book, that will be achieved." And then she starts to tell me that Jeffrey has been medically diagnosed by the best doctors in the world, and he needs three orgasms a day. At this point, I realize... [chuckling] Um... I... "Am I on drugs? Is she on drugs? What is going on?" I'm also thinking to myself, "Which chapter does she want me to put that in? I mean, is this for real?" Then she says she picks up three girls a day for Jeffrey. And the phrase that she used, which she thought explained it all was, "I cannot keep up with his needs." "I drive around. I search for a girl that looks like Jeffrey's type." "And then I go and make a deal and ask them if they'd like to give him a massage for a couple of hundred bucks." And I say, "Who are these girls? Who are you talking about?" And she says... And this is such a reveal. She says, "They are nothing." "They are trash." And it tells you everything. It tells you everything about how she compartmentalized people. I mean, she's not even acknowledging them as human beings. And of course, I didn't know we were talking about children. Had I, I would've called the police then. [cars honking] [Couturier] I think that society people are quite protective of their own. You know, if somebody you know has secrets that... Secrets ought not to be talked about. People would tend to be silent. [indistinct chatter] [foreboding music playing] [security alarm ringing] [metal doors clanging] [reporter 1] Ghislaine Maxwell has been in a Brooklyn jail cell since her arrest in July of last year. [reporter 2] And as the world awaits her fate, we're all wondering, will this formally missing puzzle piece sing like a bird or suffer in silence? There are those who say Ghislaine might have "other dirt" on other powerful men. Thoughts on that? No question about it. Uh, Maxwell knows where a lot of the bodies are buried. If I was somebody who had participated in their sex trafficking, um, I would not be sleeping easily tonight. Now, she's at the top of the pyramid, and if she doesn't do a plea deal, uh... she is facing maybe the rest of her life in jail. Unattractive though it may be, at some point, you have to face reality. There is going to come a point in time, if it hasn't happened already, and I'd be shocked if it hasn't, when the prosecutors are going to offer Ghislaine Maxwell some plea deal. Uh, it's going to consist of many, many years in prison. I don't know what Ghislaine Maxwell's pain threshold is, if she's gonna roll the dice and go to trial. But if it seems like something that's tolerable to her and less than what she would likely get if she goes to trial and loses, I'd imagine that Ghislaine Maxwell is going to consider taking it, because the credibility of the victims testifying against her is very high. [foreboding music playing] [Annie Farmer] I knew of Epstein and Maxwell before I met them, because my sister, Maria, was working for Epstein, and she had described him as a very generous patron of the arts and someone who was interested in supporting people who were pursuing higher education. One of the things Epstein brought up was that it might be beneficial for me to do something to make my college application stand out. And so he talked about taking a trip abroad. He said he would financially help me with a trip like that. And I was really excited about that possibility. And so arrangements were made for me to fly to New Mexico to meet with Epstein and Maxwell on Epstein's ranch. They were both really warm and excited for me to be there and immediately started giving me a tour of the property. It was very impressive, and right away, I felt like I was sort of swept into this world of theirs. But I soon realized that I was the only other person staying at the ranch with them and tried to just, you know, convince myself that this was normal, and this would still be a good experience. They took me into town to a Western store where they had me pick out some cowboy boots. So they really made a lot of effort to make me feel special. But once we returned from shopping, there were moments when things were very uncomfortable. One was when Maxwell said that it was important that I learn how to rub Epstein's feet. So, she took one foot and had me take his other foot and showed me how to massage them. And I, uh... you know, was not... was not wanting to do this, but it seemed like this was just expected. Maxwell talked quite a bit about massage, generally. And she said that she would be happy to give me a massage. Eventually, I said, "Okay." And so, she got out her massage table and set it up in my bedroom and asked me to undress and lay on the table. Once I was on my back and she had pulled the sheet down, she touched my breasts. And I felt very uncomfortable and was, you know, just thinking about wanting to get off of that massage table and have this be done. The next morning, Epstein came into the bedroom and, uh, said that he wanted to cuddle with me. And so he, you know, got into bed with me and held me from behind. This was now a situation that I knew in the pit of my stomach was not right. That was very scary, because I realized that I was very isolated. I didn't know what else might happen next. I just wanted to try to get away as soon as possible. This incident, of course, did affect me. It was over 25 years ago, and it's heartbreaking to think how things could've been different if someone had listened when my sister reported Epstein and Maxwell. [foreboding music playing] [wind gusting] [somber music playing] [woman] This is the victim file. I wanna... I began working with survivors of Jeffrey Epstein in 2007. I had two survivors referred to me by the FBI. And then, I had the opportunity of getting to know some of the attorneys in the area who were working with victims, who referred more victims to me. I have treated survivors who have been manipulated by Ghislaine. With the upcoming trial being only months away, I'm really concerned about how significant the triggers are going to be for the survivors. When Jeffrey Epstein was arrested again in 2019, a number of the survivors returned to therapy, because many of their memories were triggered. Many were experiencing a number of trauma reactions and flashbacks, and it brought them back to the abuse that they endured by Jeffrey and Ghislaine. Hearing Ghislaine Maxwell's name on the news can produce memories. These triggers can have all of these symptoms to resurface. When somebody has been sexually abused, it doesn't matter if it was 20 years ago or 50 years ago. This is something that will never be forgotten. [foreboding music playing] [Stein] After the assault in that hotel room, I wanted to completely forget Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. So, I went to another high-end retailer in Manhattan. And I wasn't there for very long when Ghislaine Maxwell came into the store one day. And I asked her, "How did you find me here?" And she said that some of the people that I worked with had told her that I had moved on. She again encouraged the friendship. Uh, we started talking again. And she began to invite me out socially. And I tried to stave off her advances. I tried to make excuses for why I couldn't do things. But she knew everyone in fashion, and I understood how important it was for my future to not upset them. [cars honking] One minute, I was Ghislaine's best friend, and the next minute, I was her worst enemy. She was making me question myself so that she and Jeffrey could use me for their purposes. But I knew what was happening between us was not right. Every time I tried to get away from them, they found me. I would change phone numbers, locations. There was nothing that I could do to get away from them. So, there was a lot of fear, and they were connected to some of the most powerful people in the world. I knew that if I told anyone, my life was in danger. I think the pursuit of me was definitely a game to Ghislaine and Jeffrey. And finally after three years of harassment, Ghislaine and Jeffrey stopped pursuing me. [Rellie] Ghislaine was in love with Jeffrey. She was so spellbound by him. And my impression was Ghislaine would have done anything for... for Jeffrey. I always, like, thought it was really weird that they never ended up, you know, getting married. I did think that was strange, like... You know, it's like, "What is going on in this relationship?" [Rellie] But Ghislaine also played this kind of hybrid role as social fixer, social secretary. And the notion was that they had dated, and sometime in the late '90s, they stopped. But now they were best friends. The way that it felt that she was doing the job of a wife without, you know, having an intimate relationship with him anymore. [Wyatt] I think she was too old for Jeffrey Epstein. He really liked much younger girls. But there was this bond between them, and she needed money. She couldn't feel secure without Epstein's money. It felt that she was entrapped in that whole thing. It was the price that she had to pay. She basically played a role of a madame. [somber music playing] [wind gusting] [Kogan] Ghislaine didn't only groom underage girls. Many, many victims were just barely the age of consent yet considered adults legally, so they can't testify in Ghislaine's upcoming trial. A victim who is over the age of 21, they feel it's their responsibility, and they made the decision. They blame themselves. And these women often have a harder time coming forward to get help or talk about what happened. [woman] It is the first time I'm speaking out. I wanted to tell my story, but I'm just not ready to completely expose myself. I have gone through therapy, and I wanted people to know that it's okay to talk about it. In my twenties, I was a licensed massage therapist, and that's when I first met Jeffrey and Ghislaine. Ghislaine asked me to do things while I was massaging Jeffrey. And I said I didn't feel comfortable, and she's like, "Well, why wouldn't you? It's... it's just part of the body." "This is what a man needs in order to have a complete massage." And I just felt as though I couldn't say no because I was abused when I was younger. So when the abuse started, I did exactly what I did when I was a little girl. I just detached, and I became numb, and I just did it. When you've been abused younger, you don't have the ability to just say, "No." There were times when I was exposed to someone other than Jeffrey. Some were CEOs and founders of large, well-known brand companies. Some of them were politicians. And the expectations were do what you do for Jeffrey. Ghislaine got off on this. She empowered herself with that. And she knew that she was also going to make these high-powered men happy. She was being validated. Felt as though Ghislaine was worse than Jeffrey. One time, I was finished giving Jeffrey a massage, and Ghislaine came in, and I was not expecting her. She handed me the $200, and then she started taking off my clothes. Then she proceeded to... start things I didn't want to happen. And... I was just numb. I didn't have any words. [voice breaks] And that's why... That's why, when all of this came out, I remember, it's not so much Jeffrey as it was Ghislaine because she was just the one that was guiding it all and leading it all. And I just kept on talking to myself through this and holding back the tears. The whole thing just sucks. [sobs, sniffles] [somber music playing] Female abusers comprise about 5% of the sexual crimes that are reported. Um, so it's a low number. Ghislaine Maxwell doesn't necessarily fit the mold of a female abuser. You know, class can cloud reality. So, somebody who looks like Ghislaine, well-dressed, beautifully put-together, it will give more victims the opportunity to relax and let their guard down. This one is good. That's ready. So, it was very easy for Ghislaine, because of how she presents herself, to take advantage of these victims and groom them so successfully. Based on the survivors that I treat and with everything that I have read about Ghislaine, Ghislaine exhibits characteristics of that of a psychopath. Characteristics like inability to maintain healthy relationships, uh, manipulation, deception, bullying. She also exhibits signs of a narcissist. That sense of entitlement, the sense of, "I want power and control at any cost." [reporter] A judge has denied bail for Ghislaine Maxwell with the concern that she is a flight risk. The judge in Maxwell's case recently determined that Maxwell still has international connections, funding, and experience evading detection. [McCawley] Six times thus far, bail has been denied in Ghislaine Maxwell's case. And the basis for that is a number of things. She is charged with crimes against minors, and that does have a much higher standard with respect to getting bail. [Briquelet] In the eyes of the public, Ghislaine is a monster. And so, Ghislaine's family needed a way to counteract this narrative. Imagine yourself arrested and imprisoned in solitary confinement, deprived of bail for nine months. Whatever your feelings about the allegations, she's entitled to a fair trial, to due process and to the presumption of innocence. My brothers and sisters and I will never stop fighting for Ghislaine. [Boies] We've got what looks like a new development. Uh, you may have seen this already. Maxwell's lawyers are asking for all of our files. A lot of discovery that they're not ever entitled to get. It looks incredibly broad. I mean, they're seeking all of our files for all of the victims that we ever represented. That would be, you know, giving over records of individuals who weren't even ever public. [Boies] They don't have a right to pore through our files and just see what they can find to embarrass some of our clients. It's a fishing expedition. They don't know whether there's anything there. They just figure the more stuff they get, maybe they'll find something they can use. And I... And I... And I think to some extent, it... it shows the Court how desperate they are. [pensive music playing] [Annie Farmer] I hope that Maxwell is held accountable and that she sees jail time for what she's done. But we know that she has a history of evading, uh... evading justice. [man] Annie first told me about Epstein and Maxwell in 2004. So Epstein and Maxwell have... have been a big part of our lives for years. I've been married to Annie for 14 years. We met 18 years ago in Bethel, Alaska, where she was a children's advocate. And it took me, kind of, years to... to get to a... a point where I kind of understand how best to support Annie. I'm definitely nervous. As it gets closer, I'm a little more nervous. I did talk to Sigrid, and I think we're gonna have a conversation with the government attorneys sometime soon. It's hard not to feel some pressure just 'cause I know so many people, uh, want to see justice. Is there any, like, feedback they've given you or... or, like, advice in terms of being on the stand? I think mostly to slow down. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. And just to really listen to the questions because... especially during cross-examination, right? They try and confuse you or ask you things that, um... you know, might throw you off. I want to do as good a job as I can in telling my story clearly so that the jury understands this predatory behavior and that she's held accountable. I think you'll do great. [somber music playing] [foreboding music playing] [seagulls squawking] [Edwards] Jeffrey Epstein had a very precise system for grooming and abusing young girls, and that was a system that was established through Ghislaine Maxwell. And for a time period in Florida, Ghislaine was able to introduce Jeffrey Epstein to young females, and these people start being abused by Jeffrey Epstein, and the pyramid begins. Those females were instructed to go get other females, and it began growing into this sex-trafficking operation. [Palmeri] Starting in the early 2000s, the local police in Palm Beach became aware of Jeffrey Epstein. There was suspicious activity. There were young girls in taxis, crossing the bridge from West Palm Beach to the very wealthy Palm Beach. He had actually created a sex-trafficking pyramid scheme in a local high school, and it was starting to get out. [reporter 1] A New York billionaire with a home in Palm Beach is at the center of a scandal. He's charged with soliciting a prostitute. [reporter 2] The voluminous 22-page probable-cause affidavit details in graphic language alleged sexual encounters between billionaire Jeffrey Epstein and several under-18 girls at his seven-million-dollar 358 El Brillo Way home in Palm Beach. [Boies] When Epstein was first arrested, it's hard to know why Maxwell was not arrested at the same time. [Edwards] One of the detectives that I deposed testified that he attempted to contact and interview Ghislaine Maxwell and got no cooperation. [McCawley] But her name is listed in the police materials. She's on bank accounts with that house in Florida. She's in message pads, going back and forth showing that she's at the location, even though she says she wasn't. And that's why investigators were interested in trying to talk to her. How she evaded it is another story. [Boies] Epstein himself got essentially a slap on the wrist. He spent only a year in jail. This was one of the worst miscarriages of justice that I've seen. [reporter 3] A secret non-prosecution agreement kept Epstein and his coconspirators from being charged with federal sex crimes in the Southern District of Florida. [McCawley] And that's the story here that we've seen go on for so long of power and privilege. That the powerful and the privileged were able to avoid being held accountable in this circumstance. [Edwards] The person Jeffrey Epstein wanted to protect the most was Ghislaine Maxwell. He had to know that if Ghislaine Maxwell ever flipped on him, then he was cooked. She essentially stopped coming to Florida and began to create significant buffers between her and Epstein. But we know that there was still a relationship between Ghislaine and Jeffrey because we have pictures of them in 2006 and 2007. I was 22 years old when I first met Ghislaine in 2006. These are the photos that were taken during the time that Ghislaine had said that she was slowly phasing out of Jeffrey's life. And my photos clearly indicate that that was not the case. Ghislaine was very much a part of Jeffrey's life. Ghislaine was always on her phone, always organizing. At this stage, Ghislaine didn't need to go on the prowl for new victims for Jeffrey, because Ghislaine effectively started training and recruiting other girls, and then they would train and recruit other girls. I was in a nightclub when I was targeted and befriended by a girl my age. A couple days later, my new friend invited me to join her and another group of girls to go to the Virgin Islands. And the island was owned by Jeffrey Epstein. I remember Ghislaine getting off the helicopter, and I said to her, "Hi, I'm... I'm Sarah." And she looked me up and down as if I was invisible, as if I didn't even exist. I had been on the island for a few days. I was sitting on the patio, and Ghislaine marched over and grabbed my arm and forced me into Jeffrey's room, where I was raped. She knew exactly what was going to happen to me. She is as guilty as Jeffrey, if not more. So many young girls were abused during that period of time. There was an arrogance there. They just thought they were above the law. They'd gotten away with it so long, for years and years, hiding in plain sight the sex trafficking that was going on. [Palmeri] But life changes dramatically for Ghislaine Maxwell in 2011, when an underaged victim named Virginia Roberts decides to come out publicly and name Ghislaine Maxwell as Epstein's partner in crime. [tense music playing] [McCawley] In 2000, my client, Virginia Giuffre, was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell at Trump's Mar-a-Lago and brought to Jeffrey Epstein for purposes of sexual abuse. And in 2001, Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein flew Virginia over to London, and they introduced her to Ghislaine Maxwell's good friend, Prince Andrew. [reporter 1] I wanna begin with the scandal that has the Royal Family in an uproar, allegations that Prince Andrew had sex with an underage girl. [McCawley] There is a photograph that has been widely circulated, that was taken of her and Prince Andrew. And you can see her standing with Prince Andrew and then Ghislaine Maxwell in the background. And that's when the focus also shifted to Ghislaine Maxwell. [reporter 2] Can I ask you about all the allegations that have come out, Ghislaine? Happy New Year. [reporter 2] Can... Obviously, they're very damning, involving British royalty. Have you got no comment at all? [Ghislaine Maxwell] I've made a statement, thank you. [reporter 2] Do you know Virginia? Can you at least say if she's been in your house? [Rellie] Ghislaine's reputation was in tatters. She was a broken woman, and she seemed to be desperately trying to repair her reputation. [car honking] [Mason] She invited me over to her townhouse on the Upper East Side. And she was talking in this very fevered, passionate way about saving the world's oceans. [audience applauding] I'm passionate about the ocean, the deep sea, and the wild animals that live there. The ocean is essential to life on Earth, yet despite the ocean's importance to us, we know so little about it. In 2012, I founded the TerraMar Project. [Mason] So this was a new topic for Ghislaine. TerraMar was her great cause. This was something she was doing for the planet, for humanity. [Palmeri] So while Ghislaine was still welcome in high society, and she had her charities, and she's speaking on these panels about saving the ocean, she appears to be repairing her image. Your Excellencies, presidents, lords, ladies, and gentlemen, um, I just would like to thank you so much. It's such an honor to be here. TerraMar was linking herself to a cause that was much greater than herself. It seemed a whole lot more respectable than being the former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein. [wind gusting] [man] I met Ghislaine Maxwell at a conference. Uh, it was at Kiawah Island, outside Charleston, South Carolina, in February 2014. She was very elegant, very put-together. She was very confident. She just told me all about TerraMar. And everything she said, to me, was completely convincing. I'm a media producer, uh, and a marketing professional. And Ghislaine floated this idea, like, "We really need a one-minute promo to get people to sign this pledge to save the ocean." I was like, "Just shoot something, like, while I'm here." So, after we had come up with the idea for her one-minute promo, we're like, "Great. Let's go have a drink." Now, we're at the hotel bar. That's when things got a little weird. I think I said, you know, "What are you wearing tomorrow when we shoot you down by the beach for this promo?" And she said, "Well, I've got my TerraMar T-shirt that I'm presenting in. You know, like, 'I heart the ocean.'" I was like, "That's perfect." And then she goes... [laughs] ..."You know, you should see me in my full-length leather outfit, you know, with my weapons." And I just kind of dumbly stared at her, like, "What is she talking about?" She had an incredibly electric, sexual energy about her. She turned to me, and she said, uh, "You know Lara Croft from Tomb Raider?" She's like, "Well, I'm the real-life version." And then she gave me this look, right? I was really taken aback. There was something just a little... creepy. Something just a little off. [indistinct chatter] So we met in the lobby the next morning. And she was wearing stilettos, right? She's wearing stiletto heels. And I don't know what she thought about us shooting down on a beach or what it was gonna be, but she ended up, like, walking down to the ocean and back in these stiletto heels. I was trying to have a vision of, like, "Show me your love of the ocean." Show your love. Sign the pledge. Thank you. - Again? - [Hons] Let's do three. - There's a rule of threes. - All right. Show your love. Sign the pledge. Thank you. [Hons] But it ended up kind of absurd. There was almost like a glamour shoot. [camera shutter clicking] The irony of her trying to reinvent herself with the ocean and then just being the same... the same person. You know, none of us can run away from ourselves, you know? None of us can run away from our past. None of us can run away from our actions. [foreboding music playing] [reporter 1] Victims of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein are finally getting their day in court. Opening statements in a trial that is expected to last six weeks begins today. And it is one of the most eagerly anticipated criminal trials in years. [Sternheim] Morning, everybody. It's gonna be a great day. [male protester] We, the people, deserve to know. We deserve honest and fair and ample coverage of the trial of the century. [woman reporting in Italian] [Briquelet] This is a case that has international attention. [reporting in French] [reporting in Danish] People all over the world are going to be watching. [Ransome] I hardly slept a wink last night. I was up every hour. It was important for me to be here, to show solidarity to the survivors that are testifying. They are so brave and courageous, and they are standing in their truth, and they are not backing down. [reporter 2] If she's convicted of all six charges leveled against her, she'll likely die in an American prison. So it's an incredibly high-stakes trial clearly for Ghislaine Maxwell. [Mason] It has been one hell of a saga, leading up to this moment. The charges seem so utterly devastating. [reporters clamoring] [voice actor for Pomerantz] Ladies and gentlemen, members of the jury, during the course of the trial, you will learn that the defendant and Epstein lured their victims with the promise of a brighter future, only to sexually exploit them and forever change their lives. She knew exactly what she was doing. She was dangerous. She was setting young girls up to be molested by a predator. [voice actor for Sternheim] Ever since Eve was tempting Adam with the apple, women have been blamed for the bad behavior of men. The charges against Ghislaine Maxwell are for things that Jeffrey Epstein did. But she is not Jeffrey Epstein. She is not like Jeffrey Epstein. [McCawley] In opening statements, the defense lawyers used biblical references, talking about Adam and Eve and trying to paint Ghislaine Maxwell as a scapegoat because she's a woman. That was really offensive to hear, trying to allow Ghislaine Maxwell a pass because she's a woman was really something below the belt. [reporter 1] An accuser of Ghislaine Maxwell, a woman known as "Jane," began testifying today. [Edwards] Jane was chosen as one of the testifying victims for many reasons. She was extraordinarily young when she was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell. There was direct abuse, not just grooming, but direct abuse by Ghislaine Maxwell. [reporter 2] Jane claiming her first sexual contact with Epstein was at his Palm Beach house in 1994, when she was just 14. [McCawley] Her story was really hard to hear, 'cause it included multiple offenses over many years, with not only Ghislaine Maxwell but with others. [unsettling music playing] And then, the defense was relentless in their attack of her, because her background is that she is an actress, and so they tried to use that against her. [voice actor for Menninger] You're able to cry on command? [voice actor for "Jane"] No, not always. It's not really how it works. [voice actor for Menninger] Are you acting here today? [voice actor for "Jane"] No. [McCawley] The defense's strategy is memory, manipulation, and money. They're trying to say that these witnesses are only trying to manipulate people and are after money, and they really pressed some of the details. [Edwards] When Jeffrey Epstein died, there was a victim compensation program set up. During the testimony, it was revealed for the first time publicly that some of the determinations through the program were in the millions of dollars for victims. [voice actor for Menninger] How much money did the fund award you? [voice actor for "Jane"] Five million. [cars honking] [reporters clamoring] [cameras clicking] [Ransome] The defense made me really angry. I found the defense, uh, incredibly victim-shaming, and I think we're in the era where victim-shaming and victim-blaming really needs to stop. [Mason] It's kind of a night and day, or in this case "day and night" difference, because in the morning, I've... I entered the courtroom pretty convinced that she was going away for a long, long time. But when the defense began, I have to say I was astonished. Trying to imagine how the jury was reacting to hearing these... huge amounts of money. It has to be feeling like sunshine for Ghislaine Maxwell at this point. [man] Hey, guys. Move out of his way, please. I am very pleased to have attended, uh, today in court, in person, together with Isabel, and in support of our sister, Ghislaine. Um, on a personal note, it was a tremen... gave me a tremendous sense of relief, uh, to be close to her, uh, to be able to actually see her in the flesh. Uh, even to be able to speak with her. And that's the first time that I've spoken to her personally in over 500 days, uh, since her pretrial detention started. [reporter 1] How is Ghislaine holding up, Kevin? [reporter 2] What did she say to you? I understand why her brothers can't recognize that something evil ever happened. How could you recognize something like that? And I think you have to protect your own, especially your own family. It's not that you want to find excuses for the evil that people have done, but you try to understand where they come from. [foreboding music playing] [male narrator] Once upon a Christmastime, in a big house on a hill, there lived a man, his wife, and their eight children. When Father Christmas came last year, I was fast asleep, and he put... I took my daddy's stocking away from his bedroom, then I hung it up on my bed, then Father Christmas put some toys in my daddy's... in my daddy's stocking. [Palmeri] A really big part of the image of Robert Maxwell was that he had the perfect family. [indistinct chatter] But no one really knew that behind closed doors, it was actually very dysfunctional. [man 1] His wife, Betty, told me that the children had to stand up at the dinner table and tell their father what they'd done during the course of that year and what they were hoping to achieve. And then if he didn't like something that somebody had said, he'd whip them with a belt. And then, after giving them a good sound bashing with the belt, they had to write a letter to their father of apology. [man 2] I remember well... I met Ghislaine for the first time in September 1984. She was about 22 at the time. It was at a regular Sunday lunch at Headington Hill Hall with business executives that Robert invited. And Maxwell was presiding, that rather as... as a Roman emperor or Henry VIII, this sort of large figure. But kneeling at his knee was Ghislaine. And she was sobbing, um, very, very profusely and dramatically. There was snot. I mean, this girl was crying her eyes out, trying to persuade her father to agree to something. And he was ignoring this. And this went on, to the embarrassment of everyone else who was there, but everyone was just completely ignoring this bizarre sight. I think with Ghislaine that her affection for her father was unconditional and that the urge to please him was probably a huge driving force. And, you know, perhaps she devoted the same sort of acclaim that she had to her father to Epstein instead. [foreboding music playing] [reporter] And now, to week two of Ghislaine Maxwell trial, here in Manhattan. Today, another woman is going to testify about her decades-long interactions with Maxwell and the late Jeffrey Epstein. [Edwards] My client Kate is protected, and she is able to proceed under a pseudonym. And Kate was first abused by Jeffrey Epstein when she was 17. And she was abused for many, many, many years. Kate was a teenager, an aspiring British model, a talented musician, just a brilliant person. In fact, she was accepted to Oxford. Ghislaine had gone to Oxford. So Ghislaine, in a lot of ways, was everything Kate wanted to be. And one of the first things that Ghislaine told her was that she had this very powerful boyfriend who was a philanthropist, who could assist Kate in getting her foot in the door in basically any industry she wanted. What was originally an innocuous introduction to Jeffrey Epstein had her in the devil's den, being abused in no time, and then, with literally no realistic way out. [voice actor for Pomerantz] Did Epstein engage in a sex act with you during the massage? [voice actor for "Kate"] Yes. [voice actor for Pomerantz] After it ended, where did you go? [voice actor for "Kate"] I left the room and started walking down the stairs. [voice actor for Pomerantz] And who, if anyone, did you see? [voice actor for "Kate"] I saw Ghislaine Maxwell. [voice actor for Pomerantz] What, if anything, did Maxwell say? [voice actor for "Kate"] She said, "How did it go?" "Did you have fun? Was it good?" She seemed very excited and happy. She thanked me again. My strategy for preparing Kate for trial was pretty simple. Just tell the truth and don't worry about all of the other nonsense that Ghislaine Maxwell is gonna throw your way to try to discredit you. It's not gonna work. [voice actor for Sternheim] Now, you've testified there was a time, I think upwards of ten years, that you used drugs. Correct? [voice actor for "Kate"] Yes. [voice actor for Sternheim] Fair to say that using and abusing those substances over a ten-year period has had an impact on memory. Correct? [voice actor for "Kate"] It has not had an impact on the memories that I have always had. I'm very proud of Kate and... and many of the other, uh, clients and victims and survivors that were willing to come forward and many who did, so... She... she... she was what she always is, just a completely honest person. I think that the most significant contribution that Kate made to the trial was explaining how Ghislaine Maxwell specifically invoked the grooming process in a way that facilitated Jeffrey Epstein, that particular perpetrator's ability to abuse little girls. I would believe that the jury had a light bulb go off and appreciate, "Oh, wait. Now I understand how this happened." [Stein] They finally caught up with Ghislaine, and that's something I never thought I'd live to see happen. And so, I wake up at 4:00 a.m. every morning to be at the trial. I take the two-hour journey from Philadelphia to New York. And every day, I wear a pair of Gucci loafers that were given to me by Jeffrey and Ghislaine. And I think that it's important symbolically that I'm taking my journey every day, walking in these shoes. [somber music playing] These are gifts that Ghislaine and Jeffrey gave me over the three years that I was involved with them. This is a gown that I wore to a New Year's Eve party with them. Ghislaine picked it out for me. I realize that some people might not understand why I held onto all of these things for so many years, but it's validating my experience. Having those items really helped me to understand what happened to me and were an integral part of my healing. It's grueling physically, traveling for hours to the trial. But there is nothing in the world that can stop me from going there every day. [reporter] It is a new day of testimony in the sex-trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, and a third accuser, who's going by the name "Carolyn," taking the stand. Carolyn was 14 when Maxwell allegedly set her up for Epstein's abuse that went on for years. [voice actor for Comey] What's the last grade you attended before dropping out in middle school? - [voice actor for "Carolyn"] Seventh. - [voice actor for Comey] Why is that? [voice actor for "Carolyn"] Because my mom was an alcoholic and a drug addict. [voice actor for Comey] When you were between the ages of 14 and 16, how did you make money? [voice actor for "Carolyn"] I went to Mr. Epstein's house and got money that way. Whether it was an apartment or a car or a phone, they will dangle that carrot in front of them in order to string them along and make them succumb to sexual abuse. [voice actor for Comey] What, if any, conversations do you remember having with Maxwell about your bra and hip size? [voice actor for "Carolyn"] I was upstairs setting up the massage table. And she came in and felt my boobs and my hips and my buttocks and said that I had a great body for Mr. Epstein and his friends. [reporter 1] Carolyn becoming emotional several times over the course of her testimony, as she detailed the abuse, saying she ultimately went to Epstein's Palm Beach mansion over 100 times. The experience, Carolyn said, contributed to mental health issues and addiction issues that continue to today. [McCawley] Carolyn's story was particularly hard to hear. But I think the jury connected with her. She was powerful on the stand. She didn't back down, even when challenged by the defense. The defense's strategy has been to really try to attack the victims' credibility, but I think that was going to backfire for them. [reporter 2] This morning, we're expecting to hear from perhaps the most powerful and compelling witness of all. She's an American woman named Annie Farmer, who claims she was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at Epstein's, um, ranch in New Mexico. I was outside of the courtroom with my husband and my attorney, Sigrid, and my heart was pounding. Once the door opened, one of the FBI agents led the way, and I walked into the courtroom. I wanted to make eye contact with Maxwell to communicate that I'm not afraid and that I'm there for a purpose. So, I start to walk past the table where she's sitting. I did make a point to look in her direction. And I think that she looked like she was trying to kind of busy herself by looking down and looking at notes, and she didn't want to make eye contact. Sitting up there on the witness stand, I feel... very nervous. Physiologically, very nervous. My feet are sweating profusely. My hands were shaking. I made eye contact with Sigrid, and, you know, she gestured, putting her hand on her heart, um, and I knew, you know, that she was... she was there with me. [McCawley] Annie kept a journal at the time that she was abused by Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. And as part of the case, that became evidence at the trial. [Annie Farmer] Maxwell's defense attorneys had me read a portion of my journal in the courtroom, in particular where I was going back and forth about how to interpret Epstein's behavior. "One night, we went to the movies with Jeffrey Epstein." "It was a little weird, one of those things that is hard to explain." "We were sitting next to each other, and he put out his hand for me to hold." "Then he kind of caressed, rubbed my arm and shoe/foot." "Overall, I decided it was no big deal." "It just made me mad, because he is being so amazing." "Paying for a summer program for me. Helping me with college." As a 16-year-old, I was trying to make excuses, because in my mind, it didn't fit that he was being so generous and nice and then doing these things to make me so uncomfortable and violate my boundaries. [McCawley] The defense's strategy is to use the nuance that, when she was trying to explain to herself in the journal and say that it wasn't that bad, the defense tried to use that to say, "Well, it wasn't that bad." [Annie Farmer] Then, as a part of the cross-examination, they bring up a brown paper bag with these cowboy boots in them, the boots that Maxwell and Epstein had purchased for me in New Mexico back in 1996 and asked me to... to show them. And I started to realize that what they were insinuating here is that because they were well-worn, it hadn't, in fact, been such a bothersome memory to me. I actually had worn the boots in order to, you know, reclaim this part of my history and not just avoid it or feel stressed when I saw these in the back of my closet. I think what was most really disgusting to me was the way that her defense attorneys tried to minimize and downplay what my experience was. Her defense attorneys asked me about this incident when Maxwell gave me this massage, and she had touched my breasts. They tried to... challenge the language that I used. [McCawley] They tried to get her to admit it wasn't the nipples. It was really, sort of, the outside portions of the breast. But what we're talking about here is a 16-year-old child being rubbed by an adult woman on her breasts. Regardless of which part of the breast it is. It just infuriates me to see someone equating those two and trying to confuse the public about what sexual abuse is. [somber music playing] [McCawley] I think that was just a really powerful moment, to see her on the stand, saying that and speaking her truth. [Annie Farmer] I was just barely making it out of the courtroom before I started crying. It took a little while to get composure. My husband came, telling me I'd done a good job and that it was over. And that was really... [sighs] It just was such a huge relief. [somber music playing] [siren wails in distance] [indistinct chatter] You can't ever predict what a jury's gonna do. But they have all the evidence now. So, hopefully, they do the right thing. No matter what happens, I don't think there's anything more that any of our clients or any of the women could've done, and we're really, really, really proud of them. I agree with that. [reporter 1] The case is now in the hands of the jury, and a verdict is possible before Christmas Day, which will be Ghislaine Maxwell's 60th birthday. [reporter 2] Just before 10:30 this morning, the jury asked for office supplies, including Post-its, a whiteboard. Also asked for the definition of the word "enticement." [Briquelet] I know people are impatient that there hasn't been a verdict. They're really putting thought into this and consideration, and I think if you were Ghislaine Maxwell, you'd be happy about that. [McCawley] We were hoping, of course, that there would be a very quick verdict, but as the days go on, certainly it becomes concerning that there could be a hung jury. [reporter 3] We're standing by, and we may have a verdict any moment or not today. Who knows? [tense music playing] [Annie Farmer] I was at home, and I had been trying to distract myself. And so my mom and I decided that we would go thrift shopping. And I didn't realize my ringer was off, and so I looked at my phone, and I had a missed call from my husband, and I had a text message from another Epstein survivor. I've just rushed out of the courtroom now. To give you a sense of the picture inside that courtroom, Ghislaine Maxwell is sat behind the defense table, as she has been throughout this trial. She's wearing a... a maroon turtleneck jumper. Judge Alison Nathan took her seat in the courtroom and said, "I have a verdict." So, I ran into the parking lot and called my husband, and he was on the computer and read to me as the verdict came out. [reporter 3] Ghislaine Maxwell has been found guilty of five of the six charges, including that most serious sex-trafficking charge. She faces, for that charge alone, a maximum of 40 years in prison. I started crying in the parking lot and jumping up and down, and Sigrid called on the other line. [McCawley] Of course, the very first thing, I called Annie, and we just had an incredible moment. I think we both cried together. It was... It was very emotional. - [woman] Kevin, will you be speaking? - [man 1] Mr. Maxwell? [man 2] What's your reaction? [reporter 1] Tonight marks the final fall from grace for Ghislaine Maxwell. A jury has decided that she wasn't just a bystander to the sexual offenses by Jeffrey Epstein. They decided that she was, herself, a predator. [reporter 2] What was her... What was her reaction backstage? Was it emotional? [Briquelet] Ghislaine's reaction to the guilty verdict was a little bit surprising. She didn't break down. She didn't cry or say anything. It just seemed like she took a sip of water and sat down, and that was it. Ghislaine is going to go down in history as one of those rare female predators. And that's highly unusual. What is her legacy now? Um, it's one of disgrace. [reporter 3] The charges that Maxwell has been convicted of include sex trafficking of a minor, transporting a minor to engage in criminal sexual activity, and three conspiracy charges related to sex trafficking. [reporters] Miss Menninger! Miss Menninger! You have to make way, please. One way or the other. Will there be an appeals process? Do you intend to appeal this verdict? [Sternheim] We firmly believe in Ghislaine's innocence. Obviously, we are very disappointed with the verdict. We have already started working on the appeal, and we are confident that she will be vindicated. Everyone, be healthy. Have a happy New Year. [reporter 4] How is Ghislaine doing? [reporters clamoring] [McCawley] With the counts that Ghislaine Maxwell has been convicted on, she could be in prison for up to 65 years. So, this is really a tremendous verdict for the survivors. [reporter 5] Ghislaine Maxwell was charged... [McCawley] It really shows that the jury heard them, believed them, and did the right thing by convicting Ghislaine Maxwell. For a few minutes, I cried uncontrollably. I never thought I'd ever see the day... where she was convicted. [Ransome] It's very much been a group effort to bring her down. And it's taken many, many years to finally get justice. It's one of the happiest days of my life. [Edwards] I think I've spoken to over 50 of my clients about this verdict. And one of them put it, I thought, best. She said, "I feel like we've finally been heard." [car honking] [reporter 1] Breaking news out of Buckingham Palace, just weeks after the Ghislaine Maxwell verdict, the fallout continues for a man associated with Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. Britain's Prince Andrew has reached a settlement with his accuser in a sexual assault lawsuit. [anchor] Miss Giuffre had, of course, been suing the Duke of York, claiming that he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17. The figure that's been touted widely this morning in all the newspapers and outlets is about £12 million. [Palmeri] Prince Andrew settled with Virginia Roberts Giuffre, and the Queen stripped him of his royal title. [crowd shouting] [reporter 2] An unprecedented situation, this, for the Royal Family. [Boies] This is the Queen's favorite son. That has been his persona for his entire life. He has been His Royal Highness, Prince of England, and Virginia's lawsuit is important because of that. [Annie Farmer] I was so proud of Virginia for fighting to have Prince Andrew held accountable. I mean, I could not have imagined that she would, you know, be able to accomplish this. [somber music playing] [Annie Farmer] I think it is really important to me to make a statement about how I've stood up for myself and for other women and girls. - Thank you so much for meeting me here. - Of course. [Annie Farmer sighs] And not being afraid any longer of Maxwell or Epstein and their powerful friends. I think I told you, they kept my boots, uh, after the trial. I don't know if I'm getting them back. So I would like to buy a pair of nice boots for myself. I think that this experience has made me more aware of how it's not uncommon that people who are predators have come to occupy positions with a lot of prestige or, uh, power in some way. I didn't recognize this as the systemic issue that it was. I actually was looking on your website and saw you had a boot called "The Annie." - We do. We do. - Ooh. Could I try some on? Yeah, sure. [McCawley] This whole story has been about how money and power overcome justice. And what we're seeing now is something vastly different. And I think that shows you, regardless of stature, you will be held accountable. [Edwards] All of the time and energy and effort and sleepless nights and fighting was worth it. The justice system worked. [Annie Farmer] These are good boots. [Temple] They should rename them "The Annie Farmer Boots." [Annie Farmer laughs] It's a real lesson to people about the need to pay attention to what's going on and the need to protect the vulnerable people in our society. - I got 'em. Are you ready? - [Temple] You got 'em. Yeah. You? - Good night. See you. Bye. - Good night. I'll see you. Bye. [Annie Farmer] My new boots mean to me stepping into a new phase of my life. There was a lot of darkness around what happened with Epstein and Maxwell, and I'm leaving that behind. And I'm hoping to be able to do more to share what I've learned and to connect with other people. And I think that, in a way, these boots just feel like a powerful symbol of me stepping into that new future. [somber music playing] [somber music continues]
