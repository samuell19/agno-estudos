DAIEI MOTION PICTURE CO., LTD. An under sea volcano, with a latitude of 310N and a longitude of 1400E has erupted! All vessels and planes in the vicinity are taking every precaution! Take every precaution! An eruption also occured on Miyake Island. The people had to be evacuated! EARTHQUAKE RESEARCH INSTITUTE Data, please. Data, please. Data for the press, Sir. Sorry I'm late. Looks like that seismometer has tracked a big earthquake. Yes. There's a disturbance at Miyake Island and Myojin Reef... The Fuji volcanic range has become active. Eruptions from south and north... That means dormant volcanoes may erupt? It's quite possible. Not Mt. Fuji, I hope. I hope nothing happens. What's that? Eiichi! It's Gamera! It's Gamera, Sis! GAMERA Vs. GYAOS Produced by HIDEMASA NAGATA Screenplay by NIISAN TAKAHASHI Photography by AKIRA UEHARA Music by TADASHI YAMAUCHI Film Editor TATSUJI NAKASHIZU Special Emects Photography by KAZUFUM I FUJI I Directed by NORIAKI YUASA The eruption of Mt. Fuji attracted Gamera because he loves lava. A research party is leaving to see what happened to him. Is Gamera storing up flames as energy or has he burned to a crisp? And what will be the result of the eruption? The answer rests with the research party. CONSTRUCTION SITE No answer? I'm calling him. Don't forget the whole country's watching our Road Corporation. We issued bonds promising to finish the expressway this year. We must keep our promise at any cost. Look. We're almost through, but some people refuse to move out... The central area here. That's the limit! I hear work's been stopped. Hello. One moment, please. Mr. President, it's Mr. Tsutsumi the fellow who's in charge of the road. Tsutsumi? It's your job to settle the land trouble and get the people to move. It's dangerous until we hear the research party's report. See here. Mt. Fuji's eruption or Gamera, it's no excuse to put off work. Make the landowners clear out! Boss! What's up? Starting work again. Even with another eruption? Take up our stuff. I'll follow later. Wish we knew the research party's result. AVIATION INVESTIGATION HQ. Did Mt. Fuji's eruption cause it? Gamera? Someone saw a green light. Not a single body was found? We can only say now that the eruption had nothing to do with it. Gamera then? He's not sending out any rays. There will be an announcement by zoologists. I can't wait so long! DOWN WITH THE EXPRESSWAY Awe, Boss not again! We were just here. It's them again! Get out of here. Leave us alone! What's happening? You saved us! Wait! Let's have a talk! Let me see your leader! Stop trying to sweet talk us! Please stop, everyone! Everybody stop! Just quit, please! The village leader? Not today! Later! When? Never! Hi! You're in danger! Please leave! MT. FUTAGO HIKING TRAIL THE KANAMARU HOMESTEAD So that's it? They'll start working again. We tore up the workers' quarters today. We'll go. Do as you say. Hurry up, Guys! The more trouble we make, the more we'll get for our land. The last chance for us poor folks to get rich. Isn't it? Leave the planning to me. We'll follow your lead. You're back? An expressway would mean progress for our village, wouldn't it? Selling one's land isn't that simple. Think so? Where's Eiichi? He was playing here until a minute ago. I bought him a scrapbook. Get your things and hustle! Those villagers are a greedy lot! Easier for us if they'd just kotow! This sucks! What's going on? We haven't been here since we surveyed the place. This was no accident. Hardly anyone comes here. This was done on purpose. It may continue until we reach an agreement. But we must build the expressway. Let's start fixing this place up! What's that, Boss? It wasn't there when we came last time! It smells! Smell something? I heard a gold vein shines sometimes. I think I heard that too. A vein of gold there? Might be. I see! That's why! Those men won't let anyone go near the mountain! We'll have to check it out first. The expressway passes there, so let's go have a gander. You take that side! Don't be naughty, Son. I wasn't. Just careful. Only people against the expressway pass here. I'm a hiker. Show me a short-cut? Mt. Futago? You're lying. You're a reporter, aren't you? I'd be a traitor if I took you. I get ya. A pity though. If I could get pictures of that strange light, it'd be a scoop. Scoop? I like them too. It'd be a big one if Gamera is there. Really? Do many big trees fall like this? I don't know! Look at that, Kid! What's that? I don't know. Let's go. Does it always shine like this? This is the first time I've seen it do that. There's something in there. Stop it! Have you ever been inside? No, but let's look since we're here. Is it safe? Be careful. What an odd place. I feel wind. That means there's another opening. Mister! An earthquake! Mister! Mister! Help! I'm scared! Help! Help! Didn't you hear something? No. Did you hear something? No. Don't come if you're afraid. Sister! Sister! It's Gamera! The boy is in danger! It's the village leader's grandson! Wait here! Get in the truck! Go! Go! Gamera! There's big trouble, Sir! What? I want no part of you men! You're wrong! Eiichi is on Gamera's back! A boy is on Gamera's back! That's my little brother! Eiichi! Sister! Sis! Eiichi! Don't move! It's dangerous! Please! Don't move! Stop! Stop! Watch out, just lay down. Okay! Now! Now! The switch! Gamera! Come on! Look! Gamera is about to fly. Goodbye, Gamera! You're not hurt? No! Gamera gave me a ride! Weren't you scared? GAMERA AGAIN! A BOY RIDES ON GAMERA COUNTERMEASURES HQ Gyaos' mouth sent out a ray. It cut Gamera's arm like a knife. You call it Gyaos. Why? I named it. It's voice sounds that way. As a zoologist, what is it, Dr. Aoki? It's Gyaos! A bird or a reptile? It's never been seen in the time of recorded history. A monster, I'd say. Will you explain the rays that Gyaos sends out? I have data on that. This sends out supersonic waves. It has over 20000 cycles and human beings can't hear it. It's used as a surgeon's knife too. Supersonic waves are sent out from a forked oscillator. And are concentrated on a metal plate. They are comparatively weak at first. But when concentrated on one point, they become destructive energy. These supersonic waves have about nine million cycles. I believe the ray Gyaos sends out from its mouth is the same thing. How can it send them out? The secret is only an educated guess. That Gyaos' spine is separated into two and its throat is forked. This causes a supersonic wave of several million cycles, I hypothesize. Then, Gyaos has two throats? Yes. So it can't turn its head? It's never done it when we've sighted it. The back is at a fixed angle? Attacked from the back, its rays could be avoided. What about its green light, Dr. Aoki? A sign of anger or hunger. It's sheds when its animal instincts are aroused. It lived thousands of years ago. Why did it come out now? The chain reactions caused by the eruption of the volcanic range... It probably woke Gyaos from its long sleep. In any case, it must be gotten rid of before it moves on. I shudder to think of it going to a large city. Please attack it! Very well. Adjutant. Standing by, Sir! Attack! Attack! Komaki squad. Take off immediately. Take off immediately! Mt. Futago's lighting up! Grandpa! No! Stop the attack! The sacrifice is too great. We'll attack when Gyaos appears. If only Gamera was here! Maybe he went to the bottom of the sea to cure his hand? Hurry up and get better, Gamera! Hurry and get well! Sis! Grandpa! Here we are! What is it? Gyaos is coming out! What will happen, Master? I'll go see! No, Eiichi! Go to bed! I'm not afraid. What Gamera doesn't come? A cattle farm and not one cow. Can't buy any milk then. I'll kill them! I know. They did it, right? Don't joke! What did we do? He went berserk? What're you doing? Nobody will sell us anything. We're starving. We'd like to buy some milk. Get out. My cows all ran away. It's not our fault! It's Gyaos! No, it's your fault! He tried to bring the cows back, but he was crazy when he came home! He thinks you did it! That's nonsense. You brought bad luck. You made Gyaos come out! We villagers think so! It's awful! It's not just your place! All the cattle are gone! It's just as I thought! Round up the guys! Let's go. Forget about the milk. Hurry and clean up. Don't touch it! Not so loud or your grandfather will scold you. Three hours already, repeating the same thing. We'd be the losers? Yes. They say when animals run away, disasters will follow. It's wiser to sell our land and get paid, right? I'm an old man, but this hasn't happened before. I know we'll lose money if we offer to sell our land. But I'm scared of Gyaos. Yes. I can't sleep at night, I can't stop thinking it may come out. Don't wuss out, Man! If you do, they'll knock down the asking price for sure! You want a lot of guaranteed money, don't you? Well, yes. See? Just leave things to me. Gyaos is causing tons of damage. There is no direct strategy here. It's a matter of life and death, the people hope for an early solution. Excuse me. Are all of you leaving? Yes. The work on the road has stopped and we're afraid of Gyaos. We'd like to stay, but there's no work. Come again when work begins. Please hire us then. How long are you staying here? I'm in charge here. Until I have orders to leave, I'll stay, even if I have to do it alone. You're free to go. No, Sir! We'll stay here, we're not afraid of Gyaos! Right. Who's afraid? It's here! Eiichi? Don't scare us! It's nothing. Nothing? Gyaos may come out at any time. You're not scared? No, he doesn't come out in the daytime. What? He doesn't? No. I've been keeping a scrapbook of him. He always comes at night. Really? At night? A nocturnal beast, perhaps. Hides during the day, moves at night. Yes. We didn't see him during the jet attacks. That means we might only need to be careful at night Are there flares bright as daylight? Yes, the AGIL was developed for guerrilla warfare. It's still in the trial stage, but we'll use it. If Gyaos hates light, we'll tell the people to turn on their brights. Got it! You can go if you're afriad. What? You're shaking too. Fool! That's because it's cold tonight! Oh, no! Is it here? Don't worry. The latest 6000000 C.P. flares, they're four times brighter than the full moon. Nice. Gyaos can't come out now. We can sleep soundly? No, we don't know what it'll do. Are we on watch all night then? We're closest to it. We have to signal if it comes out. Here's a sleeping bag and a transistor radio. Okay, I'll watch. You turn in. Thanks. Keep the fire going. You too. Are you okay by yourself? Leave it to me. See? It can't come out! I'll hit the hay! Boss! Pal! Kuma, get up! The signal! Open fire! Gyaos is moving south. Alert cities in Central Japan! Evacuate everyone! Look over there! Attention people of Nagoya! Gyaos hates light! Put on all the lights you have! The Chunichi Baseball Ground is open! Gather where the lights are! Gyaos flew Northeast and its whereabouts are unknown. Where did it go? A picture? We must get it! Better turn back. We can't find it. Look! Hurry! Take pictures! Stop the car! Get in here! Take it! Take it! What's that yellow vapor? What's happening to Gamera? Its head is red! Why? What's that? Gyaos' toes! Officer, hurry up! It's smaller. It was bigger a while ago. Wake up! Stop dreaming! No, it was twice as big! Nonsense! It's true, officer. It was three times as larger when I first saw it. Hard to believe. Will you examine it? It may prove useful for attacking it. Any success? It's a bold assumption, but we'll test it. The ultraviolet ray test. What's it for? We must see the result. It may prove a deciding factor in attacking it. We'll begin the test. Turn it off. Ultraviolet rays eat away its flesh. Then if it's out in the sun too long, it would die? Of course. As the morning sun came up, it's head became red. It seemed to be in pain. I see. A sign of danger? In short, exposing it to the sun is the only way to kill it? Yes. But it's difficult. For self-preservation, it won't come out. The rangers could attack it with the rays. I'm sorry. We can't make an apparatus large enough to be effective. Even if we did, the men couldn't move it. It's simpler to lure it out at night, tie it up and wait for sunrise. Think about how it can be lured out and kept from moving. That's a tough one. You saw Gamera beat Gyaos? How? Tell me! An important meeting. Later. I'm sorry. Nevermind. He's the boy who rode on Gamera's back. They're friends. Tell him. Weren't you dizzy when you were on his back? No. He flew without turning. Turning? That's a hint. Keeping Gyaos in one place and making him dizzy. Our ears govern our sense of equilibrium. We lose it when we turn around quickly, and become dizzy. Put Gyaos on a round pedestal, whirl it until he's too dizzy to move. The problem is the pedestal. Not enough time to make it. There's one above here. And so we shall start the operation. HQ! This the transformer substation! Our volume has gone up 2.5 times. Roger. Substation standing by! All set now? Gyaos is 210 feet long and weighs 25 tons. there are powerful motors attached to it. Thanks. Contact the substation. How do we lure it here? It's a big surprise. Hello, the pedestal's been reinforced! The medical lab? No contact yet, Sir! The joint's set to go! Now, checkout the entrance! What's that, Boss? A sort of fountain. Gyaos eats people. So it will be lured out by what smells and tastes like human blood. The artificial blood hasn't been made yet. It's just releasing the smell and taste of blood. Will it work? It has to. Go back to work. Hello, this is the shelter. The shelter is ready! HQ, ready set go! Boss, we have visitors. Mr. Tsutsumi! May I have a word with you please. What is it? We won't oppose the expressway anymore. So? We'd like to sell at your price. But work has stopped, there may be changes. No, please help us sign the contract. I'll tell my superiors about it. Let's go in. Where did you go? I know! You'll lose everything if you give in now. Isn't it time to sell? They may make changes. I'll carry on the talks! Don't go rogue on us! Any word from Dr. Aoki? No, Sir! It's late. I hope we make it. Dr. Aoki! Check this out! You're done? Whoaaa it's exactly like our blood. Thanks. Thanks so much! The wind is blowing southwest. We'll have nice weather, tomorrow. The wind and weather are perfect. Please proceed with the mission tonight. Yes, Sir. Contact all points! Switch over to remote control! Seek shelter immedately! Contacts are all set, Sir! Good! One hour until dawn. Start operations! HQ sent reinforcements. A helicopter has arrived just in time. Will it work? It'll smell the blood and come out for sure. Seek shelter! Turn up the fake blood! Hit the deck! Turn it up more! Higher! Switch! Faster! Faster! Are the motors okay? Safe for three hours. Full speed a head, Sir. The sun is rising? In three minutes. Trouble? Don't worry. The motor? It won't hold! How many more minutes till the sunrises? One more minute. The sun's rising! It's head is turning red. It's slowing down. Any minute now. Go to hell, Gyaos. Will the substation hold out? Gyaos is almost dead! Check out the remote control at the substation. It failed? It's going to blow! The substation is on fire. The best of man's tactics have failed! There is no way to kill Gyaos! The people's hopes have faded! If Gamera would only come... Councilman? Councilman? Where are you, Man? What is it? We couldn't sell our land! Yes, if we'd sold then, we'd be rich now. What'll you do? Wait! I don't follow you! Don't lie! Toku went to the Road Corporation HQ. They're rerouting the expressway! That's nonsense! It's just talk! No excuses! We've been doing as you said! Get our money for us, Leader! Be reasonable! Then you pay us! I lost my cows, horses and even my handyman! What're you going to do about it? Get out! Get out! You're all greedy! Don't be mean to grandfather! Eiichi, stop now! I know how you all feel. But I think he was acting for your good. So please don't blame him too much. Please! But Miss... Nevermind, Toku. Let's go. Let's go, Men. Sumiko. What is it? Gamera? Yes. He'd put an end to Gyaos. Gyaos can't stand his flames. Then those men wouldn't be mean to grandpa. But we can't call Gamera. Start a forest fire. Gyaos hates fire, but Gamera loves it. He'd come. When Gyaos starts getting weak, Gamera could beat him. But starting a fire... It's simple. Burn our mountain. A forest fire? It's our only option. But Gyaos' vapor may put out the fire. We'd keep it up till Gyaos dies in the flames. But it would be a loss of 200 million yen in trees. Money's no problem. I can't but think the Gods sent Gyaos to punish us for being so greedy. We were wrong. We were too greedy. Thank you. No, no, it's my grandson's idea. He firmly believes Gamera will come if we start a forest fire. He may be right. The forest fire is our last hope. We must make it work. Please let us have our way. We're through with the southern hilly part. Standing by, Sir! 30 minutes until sunrise! Start! A great power... Snuffs out flames! Continue the attack! It came, grandfather! Go round back, or the rays will get you! Gyaos is getting away! It'll be curtains for us if it does! Get him, Gamera! Good for you, Gamera! It's head is red! Hell ya, Gamera! Good one, Gamera! It's the end of Gyaos. Isn't it great? You can continue your road now. Yes, we'll start tomorrow. Sir. We'll start working on the road tomorrow. Any changes? Just rumors. That's fine. Thank you, Mr. Tsutsumi. We owe it all to Eiichi. Thank you, Gamera! Goodbye! Goodbye!
