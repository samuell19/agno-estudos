(Prayer dedicated to Lord Ganesha)- Everybody touch Touch what? The plate, to worship Better be clear Who is this naughty girl? She is Kavitha Krishnamurty And you? Krishnamurthy How come he answers your questions & He answers yours? We are similar to a photo copy machine If the button is pressed on his side Copy will come out from my side Never mind Your zodiac sign? Let it happen in God's name Your good name? 'Udubatti' Shivappa And yours? 'Agarbatti' Madhappa Both 'Udubatti' & 'Agarbatti' Means Incense stick, right? Though both the sticks are same their smell is different His is incense Mine is fragrance Never mind Your zodiac sign? Let it happen in God's name Don't you guys know your Zodiac signs? No But Why? We are hidden beauties Inspite of the leaves getting scorched Inspite of the leaves getting scorched Flowers keep blossoming Lets keep it aside The reason for the 4 of us to get such names is The Founder of our Orphanage Mr. Nanje Raj Urs Any reason to choose such names? As it was an Orphanage 2 brothers-renowned agarbatti manufacturers of that time Were regular donors of our Orphanage So we were given those 2 brothers names Ohh.. Elder one is 'Oodubatti' And the younger one is 'Agarbtti' Yes How did the other 2 get their names? Environmentalist couple Krishnamurthy & Kavitha Krishnamurthy Mr. Krishnamurthy had planted an Indian Almond tree in our orphanage Mrs. Kavitha Krishnamurthy had planted poppy seeds plant Therefore their names was given to these two Ohh.. Did the plants yield well? Let me know when you are free Lets try to pluck together You can take the Almonds & I shall keep the Poppy What Any more queries? So all 4 of you are orphans Does it need to be specially mentioned? Fine 3 Masale Dose Hhmm 3 Uddina Vade Hhmm 1 Kashi Halwa Whenever I came to pick the order, you wanted to ask me something, What is it? Even now, it was out of my mind Thank God, you reminded me The thing is.. There is a girl in my hometown She is a BSc graduate If you are interested I will ask her to come over tomorrow Please excuse me Just for the sake of erecting a pole A carnival can't be organised Our nature is such All 4 of us are straight forward People may get offended But we are focused No need to worry for such things People will express opinions Whether you are at house Or at a ' Farm House ' You hit the nail on the head Please don't mind As you know That I am straight forward Fine By the way.. Where were the 4 of you born? None of us know where we were born But we know where we were found Means? I was found under a seat in an inter-state bus In a bag of vegetables I was found in a dust bin Wrapped in a News paper Therefore.. I was the ' News ' in that day's News paper Stupid people They have wrapped a just born baby in an English News Paper Couldn't they find a Kannada News Paper in Karnataka That was ' Oodubatti ' Shivappa's story I was found in a public toilet In the lavotory, Wrapped in a saree By the way.. Though there are so many bananas, Though there are so many bananas, you are eating the same one from a long time Why? One to eat And the rest to lubricate Lastly, I was found under a peepal tree Near Lord Nagappa statue Put in a plastic basin Kavitha.. My face has become pallid since I changed the cream Repetitive sex will obviously make your face pallid Thats true Strong binding means lesser cracks Hey Get inside Listen.. Get inside I say Should I tighten it or Leave it as it is? Don't do anything Let it as it is If required, I shall loosen it Listen Will you come & connect the circuits at our home? If you are alone, I will come today If two of you are at home, I will come tomorrow Mister I have seen many kinds of orphans I have also watched the movie ' Anatharu ' (Orphans) starring Upendra & Darshan But I have never seen an ' Orphan ' like you Thats true It is difficult to find ' Orphans ' like us I shall tell you an incident to substantiate By the time we completed our education Found jobs to earn & be self-reliant The Founder of our Orphanage Mr. Nanje Raj Urs had passed away Mr.Dattatreya Kattimani has replaced him He said only 1 thing And that is.. Now, you guys are standing on your own feet But, as of now, we are sitting I shall slap you You naughty girl It's better you speak less Your such behaviour is what made Shantamma furious What did she say Sir? Why are you asking me? Ask her What did you say my dear? She asked me " How are the bra's that we have got this time for girls"? So what did you reply? I said " It's better than the last time but it sags sometimes " Nonsense Let it sag or droop Can't you quietly wear whats given to you? Calm down Let's listen to what Sir has to say But Sir If you don't mind, can I ask you something? What is it? Who told you the ' sagging ' matter'? As I am a lawyer, I asked out of curiousity We can continue If none of you is interesed Should I take up the topic that I am here for or not? Actually, you were the one who deviated to another topic Aey You just keep quiet If you are very curious Assume that Sharadamma has told him Isn't it a possibility Sir? Bufoons Let me calm down and then speak to you guys Sir.. Sir..Sir.. Please come back Sir This did not end here More fun to follow After about 20-25 minutes After the caretaker had calmed down We were called back This time, none of us spoke He wa the only one to speak Though he was the only one to speak It was meaningful The thing that I want to tell is simple You have all grown up into adults And are capable enough to take care of yourselves Untill now, you have stayed in the Orphanage for the rest of your lives Experience the bliss of staying in your own homes If possible You can support a few orphans Don't consider it as an obligation Or a responsibility Because.. Anyone can give anything to anybody in this World It's not easy to entrust one's heart Wether you feed someone or burn the funeral pyre It should be done wholeheartedly So.. Before standing in support One should entrust their heart Then.. The rest will take care of itself True Sir One more thing You guys were not fortunate enough to know who your parents were But You have an oppurtunity to tell your kids that you are their parents It's true that kids are essential for family & life But It should not be for the sake of custom or Or one's sexual desire Expecting our children to feed us in our old age Provide medicines Provide us bedpan during paralysis or Will perform our last rites, should not be the criteria to have kids These things Children will take care Or the society will take care in the absence of kids This is the distinctiveness of life Once you have kids after marriage Rather than giving them responsibility Make them responsible The reason for telling you this is.. It may sound harsh to you But its a fact Only because your parents were irresponsible You guys ended up as orphans Therefore.. If you can't accept responsibility Forget kids Don't even get married Someone will perform the last rites after death If not the city corporation will do it Do you know why? Why Sir? If people ignore saying "Why should we be bothered abount an anonymous dead body" It will start decaying & unable to bear the stinking smell, Someone will do the needful It is not necessary to have children for it Think about it Humans are not orphans after their death 4 people will be there to carry Affordables will arrange a band set Inspite of having differences Relatives will come to see you one last time Therefore Humans are not orphans after their death But, when he is alive If no one accompanies him for a coffee Doesn't it make in an ' Orphan'? There may be crores of people in the World If he can not connect or support Inspite of everyone around He is still an ' Orphan ' ' Orphans ' are not the only ones who stay in Orphanages There by.. None of you are Orphans Until now, you had the support of the orphanage And also us It will continue in the future too But, More than anything You will be there for each other You will have your own little world Definitely Sir Fine, you may leave now May God bless you Sir.. A small thing before we leave Tell me Take your underwear As it was put up for drying It had flown into my room, with the wind Nobody had picked it until morning So I got it Whats the proof that its his underwear? The lawyer in him comes out Come on tell Looking at a branch, can't you make out the source of the leaf? Get lost from here Sir Sir..Sir..Sir.. The Manager taught us life lessons These lessons which are not taught in any universities of the World We decided then & there that All 4 of us will stay together so 3 sticks & 1 ball Aey Pardon me 3 boys & a girl We seeked some time from the orphanage & Started looking for a rental home We needed a 3BHK house We began to search Guys Don't talk nonsense in front of them Namaste Sir Namaste I am ' udubatti ' Shivappa We are looking for a rental home As there was a To-Let board We came over to enquire What about them? He is ' Agarbatti ' Madhappa Oh..Ohh He is Krishna Murthy She is Kavitha Krishnamurthy Parents & relatives? We are not blessed with it Sir Are you Orphans? No Sir We are friends Is she married? Why Sir? People are eveready to serve an empty plate Oh So, thats the matter Sir In her case The leaf hasn't ripened yet It's still a bud What? She recently attained puberty Rituals need to be done soon Yes I look like an adult Only after fulfilling a vow I attained puberty Get out..!! Shivappa This is the house that aunty referred It's nice Hope they let it to us Mortar is chopped off Who is it? Yes We are looking for a rental home Mam Where do you work? He is an electrician I am a delivery boy at ' Kare Maadi, Oota maadi ' He is practicing LAW She works in a beauty parlour Are you Vegetarians or Non-Vegetarians? We are not particular Madam Working hard to make ends meet Any elders? She has recently attained puberty Hence, she is the eldest amongst us Shameless fellows Go away from her Yes Sir Will you let-out the house to us? No, it's not possible She is not married yet Its better you better talk about the house And not her marriage Let me speak You keep quiet for a moment Look Sir I like him Not sure whats in store for the future Will you let-out the house to us If you do I sware on God that We won't have sex until we get married He spit on us Kavitha.. Do you really like him? Yes Then why didn't you tell us? Some things should be told Some things should be put forth What is your opinion? You are like an porn magazine How much ever one resists pages keep flipping Shall we go in search of houses? First answer her Yes Why are you heeding to her words Will anyone want to marry her? Listen I am the one whom you will marry You make a note of it How can you be so sure? What is your name? Krishna Murthy What is my name? Kavitha Krishna Murthy That says it all Talking to you will make me mad Finish eating and join me I shall leave Aey Hey Krishna Murthy If you agree We can read page 14 & 17 of the adult magazine As soon as we find a house On one side, we are struggling to find a house These two have brought up a fresh issue Once again we started to look for a house Whom do you want to meet? Is anybody there at home? Pappa is there Will you put a little word to him? can you call him a bit? I shall put a complete word to him I shall call him completely Pappa.. She is pretty sharp for her age Yes I had called you regarding the rental house Sir ' Udubatti ' Shivappa right? Yes Who are these guys? It's for the 4 of us that we are looking for a house 3 boys and 1 girl? Yes Sir I won't let-out " We won't let-out " Why people won't let-out their house to us? Please explain Is it our fault that we are bachelors? Or is 1 girl staying with 3 boys a mistake? Please tell Trust & purity exist only when one is bound by a relationship? If so, I have a question Are all the relationships in the World pure & trustworthy? It's a never ending debate Still Please don't blindly conclude every mind to be contaminated Yes, Its true With custom exists misdeeds & delibration But the choice should be yours On a serious note More than fun, jolly & sex in a relationship between a Male & female There is affinity There is trust And also respect, concern among other things To retain these Husband-Wife Or Sisters Or Brother-in-Law - Sister-In-Law Its not necessary to be bound in such relationships Without being bound One can stay pure Yes These things will be present with or without being bound by relationships But only when we stay pure One more thing Lets keep our ' Mask ' aside and ask ourselves wouldn't many men reach out for an external dice In order to secretly play a board game? Similarly, many women Wouldn't many women secretly tasted an other fruit than the one at home? Please excuse her words But, isn't it true? Fine There are people who have let-out their houses with trust And there are many who have broken that trust We just want to say Please don't suspect every one Have trust Nobody is giving us an oppurtunity to proove that we are trustworthy In such circumstance, our lawyer friend came up with an idea I know that none of you believe in such things Even I don't Still, why not try it once? Come to the point Thing is.. If all of you agree Shall we meet an Astrologer? Why are you shaking your head looking at the cowry shells Guru ji? Presumably, Since his younger days He must have played more with the cowry shells I shall slap you Stupid fellow I am doing my calculations And you say that I am playing with these cowry shells Actually One starts playing with cowry shells only after calculations, right? Correct You look like an intelligent educated girl What have you studied? As of now " Rathi Vijnaana ' (Porn Magazine I have heard about Science But not heard of " Rathi Vijnaana " It's a huge subject To study Science, you need to switch on the lights To study " Rathi Vijnaana ", you need to switch off the lights Switching off lights will lead to darkness How can we see the words & the pictures? Nonsense Thats it's speciality Only when darkness is formed Does the light emanates from the pictures get back to calculations Is it? Do you have any book in your bag at this instant? If required I shall switch off the lights Sorry Guru ji We have only one book And that is in the Orphanage Whenever required, all 4 of us get together and do combined study You shut up Keep this " Rathi Vignaana " topic aside See if we can get a rental home Okay, Fine!

I thought you will be getting us a own or a rental house Hey You keep quiet We didn't want to come here We came here with the hope of finding a rental home But Guru ji But you are caught up in other kind of houses & " Rathi Vijnaana " Leaving these things Why don't you follow Science? This generation youngsters Blindly follow science and end up as fools What you are saying is illogical Guru ji There is no example of people turning naive because of science Science is essential for development And " Rathi Vijnaana " is essential for pleasure Is it so? Oh my God Even if we 4 don't find a house And end up on streets We will never come back to you Lets go guys I had cautioned them mid way That lets not go there You can see the result yourselves Even after this, We went around looking for a house But We got varied reactions Not possible No Impossible Don't turn towards this direction These 3 can stay Not her Why?

Yes I am 'udubatti ' Shivappa And you? ' Rangayana ' Raghu Guys Does film artist ' Rangayana ' raghu have a real estate office too? Why are you asking this?

Upon calling you regarding rental house You asked to meet near the wall with condoms Which flavour do you want Sir? Pink is favourite to females The one that gives me pleasure is orange flavour Bloody loafer, has cut the call What a way to give back While giving, give it with full force Rather than calling Lets directly go to a real estate office and try to convince Fine, Lets go tomorrow Sister What?

Yes We thought only we use petromax in this age You using it in these modern times is surprising My Father gave this to me for my baby shower When I asked for the reason I don't know if he told me the truth or not He said " You were 3 months old when your Mother passed away From then on, I spent my life with a ' Petromax ' " The one who became a petromax of my life Became the light of your life Among all the things he said Only 2 words stayed in my heart " LIFE " And " LIGHT " Therefore I have preserved it " Life & Light " Your Father became the ' Light " of your life ' Our Fathers became the ' Darkness " of our lives ' In the absence of Father, It would have been great If our Mothers would be the ' Lights ' of our lives Don't know whether they themselves were lost in the darkness or pushed us into it What we saw in that darkness is the ' Light ' of the petromax Yes Amma Don't know why we are sharing this with you all of a sudden Since we arrived at the age of discretion We had only heard " Amma " But we saw you We often think If we find a ' Mother ' in future She should be like Infosys Sudha Murthy Here you are also Sudha Murthy And she is also Sudha Murthy She sits on a chair and you on a wheelchair Just a minute Hello Mr. Krishna Murthy Namaste Madam tell me I am at your friends parlour I am at the parlour that your friend works in She is on leave today it seems Yes Madam She is here with me Let it be In my next visit I will take service from her Ok Madam I will inform her Madam Ok Madam Krishna Murthy Yes Madam Last time when we planned for a movie You had said that only 1 option is available " Aase pooraisu " "(Fulfill my Desires) " Yes Is it still running Who is it? My senior Last time I had told her about a movie " Aase pooraisu " She is asking if it is still running That day We spoke like actual Mother & children After this Mrs. Sudha Murthy kept on ordering ' Ottu Shavige ' ' Udubatti ' Shivappa kept delivering those orders As our relationship with Mrs. Sudha Murthy grew An incident occured on December 13th On that day We wanted to surprise Amma But we ourselves got surprised But before that surprise Please excuse us Ms. Meenakshi Why?

Oh my God! You guys are very naughty Sorry Amma There are filthier things happening around us Still some stupid fellows Ignoring all those things Term this naughtiness as " Double Meaning " true dear Some people just keep speaking Still A statement shouldn't be given Just because there is a camera One shouldn't comment Just because there is a keyboard It was like hitting with a shawl wrapped around Now Lets celebrate Amma's birthday Before that, I want to ask you something What is it dear? I read your name as Sudha Murthy in the App Were you working earlier? Yes I was a senior branch manager in State Bank of India It was not even 6 months since I took VRS When I lost my husband 3 months after his death And due to a peculiar illness I lost the strength in my legs If she wasn't there Even I would be Orphaned From now on, Don't worry Amma " We will be with you " Is a regular dialouge Knowing that it's not easy People jus boast about saying it One thing I can assure you from our side As much as possible we will stand shoulder to shoulder Definitely Amma If it's possible we will say yes Or else we will say No Yes We are very strict in this matter On Monday, she called me to read ' Rathi Vijnaana ' I said No She again called me on Wednesday I said Yes Uncle Vijnaana means Science, right? Yes dear But you are not old enough to read ' Our Science ' So you read ' Your Science ' Now will you get a knife? Ok Amma A small surprise for you Careful dude Ok Dude Ohh Ottu Shavige Yes Amma Once we learnt that you love Ottu Shavige We thought of getting this cut instead of a cake I asked her milk to prepare Kheer Sorry I asked her to get milk, but we couldn't bring & prepare it Along with it As the petromax is the ' Source of Light ' for all of us We have brought it in the form of a candle Light it and don't blow it Amma Amma Why are you crying? If there is nothing Why are you crying? These are tears of joy What joy did we provide Amma? Nature of people who give joy & happiness to others is such that After doing everything They say that they haven't done anything One should be worthy to Even to make someone cry Specially Those who can bring out the tears of joy are Actual humans Having given birth to such wonderful kids like you It's your respective parents misfortune that They could not retain you guys Also my misfortune that I didn't give birth to children like you Why are you speaking so Amma Please cut your favourite Ottu Shavige Stay happy Have fun It's your day Yes Amma You shouldn't remove the plug when the power is on Aey Doen't she know when to remove? You speak nonsense Candle Knife Bro.. You have created enough ashes by lighting fire Please give it to Amma Amma take it Very glad Amma Light it Excuse me Whats going on here? Who are you all? Thing is Pratibha They are my conversants They are here to meet me What nonsense Just because you know them, you have allowed them inside the house like relatives Are you out of your mind? Miss Is this the way to speak to elders? Shut up..!! How dare you? You are questioning me at my own house Listen prati.. Keep quiet I said keep quiet Aey Who are you all? Why have you come here? Mummy They are here to celebrate granny's birthday Being family, We don't celebrate this woman's birthday What makes you celebrate it? What is this? As I like Ottu Shavige They have got it in place of cake Oh My God Whats happening in this house? If they are at so much ease that they can enter our house and cut a cake Since how long is it happening? Swathi Why didn't you tell me before? Mummy These uncle & aunty are very nice Shut up Go to your room I said go to your room All of you Get lost! Even after I asked you to leave Why are you looking at that woman? Get lost You guys.. Shut up You shouldn't utter a single word Hey you Why are you leaving this behind? Take back you fucking cake My foot Birthday it seems That is when we got to know that the Amma that we saw Was quite different from the one that was inside that house We never imagine that she would be in such confinement Looking at others we feel that we are orphans Actually we are orphans For instance Mrs. Sudha Murty Inspite of having a son, daughter-in-law and a granddaughter Isn't she a 'Orphan'? Single woman Don't know what she went through after we all left To run away from all this She doesn't have power in her legs A humble request There might be many differences between you Inspite of your presence at home Don't ' Orphan ' your aged parents With an ego that you are feeding them or helping them with their daily needs Staying away from them Even you don't become ' Orphans ' Elders make mistakes But you younger ones should forgive them and become admirable Your ego might not allow you to forgive When the elders have made a mistake But Wouldn't the same elders forgiven the mistakes that we have done in our younger days Just think about this one thing Even you will get old one day I hope you all understood In the week after this incident We hadn't recieved any phone call or message from Mrs. Sudha Murthy Even we had not done it from our side Because Phone call or a message from our side might put her in trouble Madappa You are a short tempered person How could you control your anger? Control? I was furious If Amma had given a signal If she had given.. I would have ragged & dishelved her Thank God he said ' Ragged ' I thought.. Aey You better shut up I am not able to tolerate him And you have started Coming back to Mrs.Sudha murthy A couple of day after the incident I was getting ready to take bath For a while none of us spoke The tears were continuously flowing out of Mrs Sudha Murthy's eyes Finally, I gathered myself and spoke Amma Why did you take trouble to come here? You could have called or messaged us We would have come over Where would you have come to? We know that its not possible come home We could have met in some Temple Why did you take so much trouble You guys came to my place and got insulted So I came over to youe place to apologise Please don't use such terms Amma Forget it Amma What should we do to keep you happy? We will try our best to do it Then You should never come to meet me Nor should you call or message me You shouldn't even try to locate me or know about me This is all that you have to do If possible Forgive me That was the last time that we saw Amma After that day, We are seeing her today As Amma wished, We didn't call or message her. nor did we go in search of her That is why ' Udubatti ' Shivappa fell unconcious This is the story of our association with Mrs, Sudha Murthy Now tell us Why are you staying in an old-age home inspite of having your own home? Lets talk about it at the right time Now go and see the flat Flat? Yes It's in Bogadi I still want to ask you 3 boys & a girl you also know that we all are unmarried You don't even know us In such scenario, How did you agree to let-out your house to us? When Meenakshi told about a team of 3 boys & a girl When Meenakshi told about a team of 3 boys & a girl I instantly remembered you guys but I didn't know that it was actually you guys When I showed your pictures on my phone She asked me to bring you along That brings us all here today Amma You could have called us after you came here After I came here I was feeling lost So I couldn't think anything Fine Amma Whenever you feel like sharing your grief You can share it with us Chandrakala I am getting it Amma I have a condition to let-out the flat to you guys What is it? Is it that me & him, lost in thoughts shouldn't sleep together? Isn't it the issue that we are facing since we started to look for house? I shall slap you so hard that your face will be swollen Has Amma ever thought about us in that way? Sorry Amma Amma You don't need to worry Even if these two are lost in thoughts I won't let them sleep Bro.. Will you keep quiet? Amma Please tell your condition Between us There won't be any agreement Or any advance You just have to pay rent What Amma is saying is a ' Harsh Truth ' If people would retain trust only on papper There wouldn't be any place or value for affection True If we, who are always yearning for money, property, position & power Can let go of our ego There won't be a need for any papper Or a court Nor any lawyers True If people could let go of their ego Many historical Kingdoms would not have descended Amma Chandrakala Yes If the sweet is ready Serve it to them Ok Amma Shivappa Amma You very well know why I am giving this to you Let all of your lives be filled with Light What a surprise & twist Until now, We couldn't find a home Along with home we found a Mother Also the hearts reconnected That night None of us spoke We lighted the petromax that Amma gave And sat quietly Is it a new complex? Yes Recently completed People have started occupying Is there a lift? Why bro.. If its unavailable, can't you climb the stairs for time being I can climb I have 2 boils on my right thigh It may rub while climbing Coincidently May be ' Agarbatti ' Madappa's bad luck lift was not yet operational Moreover it was the 3rd floor We got tired to climb ' Agarbatti ' Madappa's boils got rubbed Poor fellow I have already seen the flat You guys see Thank you Yes Mr. ' Lodge ' Babu What Do you really want a site? You are at the lodge 24/7 Why would you require a site? Ok I will send over a broker, Mr. Karunakar To the lodge Don't mistake him to the ' other kind ' of broker He will come to the lodge & discuss about the site Fine I shall hang up Not bad Lighting & ventilation is quite good The common issue with flats is that Most of the builders Would have accomodated a slipper stand But wouldn't have a specified place for God What if there is no pooja room/temple Having faith in God is important The flat is convenient Total 3 rooms 2 on this side And 1 on the other All have attach bathrooms From now on, I can peacefully read ' Rathi Vijnaana ' Though it's a bit compact I chose the 1st room Because I will be the lone person sleeping here So, this is sufficient for me Atleast from now on, I should sit here & solve neatly I mean the ' Riddle ' The balcony room was alloted to me & her If he studies ' Vijnaana ' in the balcony I can read ' Rathi Vijnaana ' inside the room It need not be mentioned that The 3rd & final room is for me Not too small nor too big Let it be To take measurements Measuring guage may be small or big ' Item ' is important How is the flat? First class Its built according to Vaastu More than vaastu We believe in Reality Ventilation Sufficient light God's blessings What more is required? Everything is fine But I need to press & check Press what? Main switch Madappa Better frame your sentences properly Be careful while using words like " Press " & " Push " Sure By the by She told the we need not pay any Deposit amount But she mention the rental amount You have to discuss that with Amma Fine, lets go On the way, lets have a strong coffee Lets go Just a minute Before we leave with your permission Can I hug you once? Tell me Can I hug you? Are you getting tempted? Not that way Thank you But why? Even in normal circumstances, getting a own or a rental home is a challenging task In such scenario Trusting people like us with no direction & fortune Thank you for getting us this house Thank you so much Everybody has direction & fortune Even if fortune is missing Direction will definitely be there Once you follow that direction You will automatically find fortune Brother.. Have you finished wishing her? Why bro.. If you are done Even I want to wish her with a hug Why Sister? Won't you hug someone like me? Brother.. I can pull out a wire from a complicated pipe Thats my wiring expertise But I don't know to talk politely or delicately Or to thank We are glad that you got us a home Brother.. Now tell me What shall we do next? Mr. ' Agarbatti ' Madappa If you are done I am next in the queue Today seems to be a hugging day Good Finally To find a rental home was as pleasing as getting milk & obattu at the Orphanage So After visiting the flat Me & Krishnamurthy headed to the Taluk office as we had some work there And I Had to meet someone at Irvin road A lady After everone left Me & Mrs. Meenakshi were left behind Both of us had no work to do Both were free If you are done Shall we leave Just a minute Yes Ma Take it It's Amma Is it your Mother? No Sudha Murthy Amma Amma Namaste Namaste Son Did you all like the flat? We like the flat As well as Ms. Meenakshi Sorry Amma We liked the flat As well as Ms. Meenakshi's affectionate heart Fine Son On an auspicious day, complete the tradition of spilling over of milk Sure Amma I will also invite you on that day Please come & bless us Fine Son Go to a Temple and enquire with the priest about an auspicious day Thank You Amma I will give the phone to her Hello Ok Amma I shall call you later Fine dear Shall we leave? Tell me before we leave For getting you this flat What will you give me? What should I give you? You will get your comission for sure Is it? Rather than you giving comission to me Will you accept if I give you Will you be giving? I am feeling nervous You accepted my gift Will you give me what I ask for? I can give if it's giveable Ask me if it is askable If you suddenly give it like you did now If you take it yourselves It will be tough Really? Was just teasing you What do you want?

Is it true that those who drink buffalo's milk have a low IQ? Low or high Lets get to the topic Milk's topic came up because Last time while celebrating Ganesha Chaturthi at the Orphanage Seeing the milk that was served along with chiroti You had said " there is a nicely formed cream Which milk is this "? No one knew whose milk was it I shall slap you You are sayin " whose "? You should say ' Which '? Packet milk or Cow's milk At his age, when Its difficult for him to drink skimmed milk What say miss Won't the full creamed milk get stranded in his throat? It has never got stuck down my throat Frankly speaking Sir is fond of cream & honey Stop it Senseless fellows Just like bad habits are contagious Her company has spoiled you Sir please don't get angry I apologise on behalf of her Still The milk she was referring to Was it Mrs. Sharadamma's?

True I have read in ' Rathi Vijnaana ' that it is not easy at all Will you guys keep quiet or not? Sir We roamed around a lot looking for a rental house Nobody let-out their houses to us In such a scenario Your daughter Ms. Meenakshi Trusting us orphans Why do you call yourselves an orphan? I am in love with you You are in love with me When we are planning to get married soon He will be your Father-In-Law And she will be your Mother-In-Law Then how will you be an orphan? Meenakshi Please elaborate what you said Shall I elaborate SIr? Bro.. No need for you to elaborate We have had enough of your " elaboration ' mess We will extricate our shells ourselves Fine Will you please explain? Amma I will explain Thing is.. there is no thing You keep quiet Amma I like him Even he sort of like me Once you both accept and and at an appropriate time We wan to get married Thats the matter look I have shared my feelings directly in front of my Parents It's better even you share your opinion So that there are no hiccups in the future Okay I just want to tell that If you wholeheartedly get your daughter married to me I will get you a print out in a year No I meant, We will give you a cute kid Now tell me Will you come to our spillin ceremony or Will you give them permission to 'Spill'? I shall slap you How was the surprise? We came here to invite them for milk spilling ceremony Bu got permission from their parents for or wedding And the only one left is.. Sudha Murthy Amma We thought of inviting her on thursday But before that she took me to Chamundi hills by the by Why did you particularly bring me here? If i am very happy I come here Even if I am sad I come here Don't know why Sitting here looking at Lord Basavanna Heavy heart gets lightend If I am happy The happiness increases Meeting you guys Going around with you guys Above everything Speaking about us to my parents Has made me very happy That is why I came over to see Lord Basavanna Are you annoyed that I brought you here? Not at all Even I visit the hills frequently To speak to Amma (Godess Chamundi) We grew up without seeing our Mother So I come here when I feel like speaking to Amma Also come here when I feel like crying sometimes I even come here to fight Standing in front of the Shrine I silently keep quarelling But Amma remains Calm Isn't it the nature of all the Mothers? Even if husband or children betray She will be calm Finally Amma consoles me And asks me to take arati before going Its a nice thing between you & Amma Your surprise was also good The one with your parents You got shocked, right? Obviously All of a sudden if you raise the wedding topic It is obviously going to shock Even I had not planned it When you said ' We are orphans ' Don't know what happened I just spoke out whatever I felt Let it be More than everything went about with ease it finished effortlessly True But I have a question You are beautiful, educated and confident You could have found high profile match What made you like me? True I can find better boys & match than you But Can't find an affectionate heart For love & marriage For family & life More than beauty & salary Affectionate heart is important Why aren't you speaking anything? You have become silent Oohh Did you understand what I said? Or should I elaborate? Not required I understood Now I will ask you a question Please ask You said that Whenever you feel like talking You visit the Amma on the hills Then In your growing up years at the orphanage Didn't you try to look out for your parents? Sorry If I hurt you Not really I didn't understand how to answer your question When we don't know who our parents are How will we know the Answer From that point, Ms. Meenakshi was silent Until we got down the hill Even I didn't speak anything As we crossed the gate And reached Mysuru Cavery silk emporium Ms.Meenakshi spoke What happened? I will ask you directly Let me know if it is possible or not First ask Not sure why I chose today I will bowl Will you bat? Oh My God! Will you give me some water? Most of it is spilled over Only a little is left Good enough Spilling is good Where has it escaped? What are you looking for? My bra Its here It was struck down You haven't spared this too Lets relax for a while Naughty I am asking you out of naugtiness You should answer promptly What is it? Have you been a good ' Batsman ' from before? I was confident of being a good ' Batsman ' But had not found a ground to play By the way What did you feel about my 'pitch'? A little bouncy But convinient for cover drive strokes How was my batting? No doubt a good ' Batsman ' Takes a little time to get set Can easily get the wicket through ' inswing ' We both are made for This kind of naughtiness Is there anyone who doesn't indulge in these kind of naughtiness? People like us Do it openly And a few others Do it secretively Everything is a disguise Those who do it secretively Term our words as ' Vulgar ' What is your view on that? We shouldn't bother about it Just because the street dogs bark Should we stop going to the street? They keep barking And we should keep walking True By the way According to you What is " Vulgar " Inspite of having their own house Children leave them at Old-Age homes That is ' Vulgar ' Ignoring principles, people change sides to rival parties That is ' Vulgar ' Taking deposits by luring people with high interest And run away with the money That's cheating As well as ' Vulgar ' Being well aware that it's better not be on the awards selection panel People get into it & end up in ugly controversies Isn't it Vulgar? Not only that Not only the rights of the Farmers We are snatching their lands too Isn't it vulgar? Keeping the religious bias at heart and showcase themselves as secular Isn't it Vulgar? Not only that The entire world is stinking in such Vulgarities In my opinion, not leading the life in the right way is ' Vulgar ' Irony is Those who don't even know the meaning cry foul as double meaning Very well said Let it go Even if people scream from their roof tops We will only do things that we feel is right Lets correct ourselves if we have made a mistake Or else, lets march ahead At the end of the day We should be clear about our journey Fine get dressed up I will leave, its getting late Before leaving, shall we play a ' super over match '? Not today Lets play a 50 over match another day You keep bowling And I will keep batting Until the last over I won't get ' out ' Finally, one more thing What is it? I will share my thoughts Decision is yours Tell me You shouldn't feel bad that I am using this term You have grown up as an orphan There are no elders in your life In the old- Age home even Amma doesn't have anyone of their own Why shouldn't you bring her home to her own rental home? That moment, Ms.Meenakshi gave a wonderful suggestion I was speechless Along with it She told another thing in front of home I got shocked hearing it Take it You had left your watch behind Thank you Anyway, thanks once again Why are you thanking again Trusting us, you got us a house Uniting us with such a Mother You have already given thanks on the bed Actually you should thank my parents why them? of course Only because they went to a function at Heggada Devana kote You could hit cover drives with me Fine, A thanks to them too You are very fortunate What fortune? Today you spilled at our house In a couple of days time you will be spilling at your home Spill what? Milk We were very happy with the idea of bringing Amma home In this happy mood we all went to meet Amma Ms.Meenakshi was supposed to meet us on the way We picked her up & went to the Old-Age Home You know what Sudha Murthy Amma asked us? Please speak Amma You can wholeheartedly ask whatever you want to Will you take me to the Cauvery River near Srirangapattana? Amma All of a sudden, why did you ask us to bring you to the River Cauvery waterside? Share it if you want to Don't do it if it upsets you I lost my Husband In this Cauvery River He got into the river to take bath Don't know if he slipped Or the water grabbed him He flood away right in front of my eyes Not only till that night the search operation went on for a week But we haven't found him till today Did he flood away to another shore Or has he passed away Is a mystery Don't know why I was remembering him since morning That is why I asked you to bring me here Also The house in which I lived with my husband Got sold with the help of Meenakshi Have you sold the house where I used to deiver Ottu Shavige? I didn't sell I was made to sell I didn't understand Since my Daughter-In-Law came home after marriage We didn't speak much On my birthday After the incident with you guys She stopped speaking to me completely After a long time On a Naraka Chathurthi Mustering courage My Son spoke to me Swathi Have you finished you dinner? Yes Appa Wash your hands & go to bed Good Night Granny Good Night Good Night Amma Amma I have to discuss 2 matters with you Go ahead The thing is..

Was there a call drop? No Dear He said " Give it wholeheartedly Your blessing is my protection " You are blessed To have a Son like him Now a days, where Parents & old age people are being neglected by their children Its surprising to see such children True It may seem that I am boasting in pride My Son is not a human He is no less than God Come inside dear I will give you the documents I am fine here Please get it Hello Tell me Sir Did she give the documents? She has gone inside to get it Fine But Don't tell her that I had called again Why? Madam My Mother cares me a lot She frequently calls me & enquires if I had Kashaya & applied eye drops etc.. Don't forget to rest for 10 minutes after lunch As a Son, Isn't it my duty to follow her words? Exactly But As you know Due to work pressure, Sometimes we miss it She will be hurt upon learning about it So I would not like to hurt my Mother So sweet Thanks Whatever it may be Mother is equal to God I am very happy to listen to your words This is how a Mother-Son relationship should be The Godess in the Temple may desert you The Godess who gave birth to you will never desert you Thanks Madam Don't forget to collect the documents Ok Take it dear Have you kept all the documents? Yes I will take your leave Listen Yes Nothing dear It's alrite, you can tell me No Nothing Fine, I will leave Ok Meenakshi didn't know then that I was not in favour of selling the house Even I had not shared it with anyone Even if wanted to, there was nobody whom I could share it with Finally the house was sold Because of Meenakshi Please forgive me Amma If I knew the facts Definitely, I wouldn't taken up this deal After that day The next time I saw Amma was at The Sub-Registrar's office She must have been in deep pain that day Before signing the documents She couldn't stop herself from asking Amma Why haven't you signed Amma? Listen dear Tell me I know that it is too late to ask this But I am not able to supress my distress Can you somehow Stop the sale of this house? Amma I am already in some tension Come Swathi I will buy it later for you Amma Did you sign the documents? The thing is No Not yet Why haven't you signed yet Amma? I was not sure where to sign So was asking her Madam I shall guide her to sign Give it to me Sorry Can I borrow your pen? Amma It is very simple Take it Over here I was shell-shocked at that moment Within no time Even the registration was completed My comission was paid in cash that to right in front of Amma By then I knew the truth Then the feeling inside me was of Distress The entire night, I was restless First thing I did in the morning was Call Amma Hello Amma Meenakshi here Meenakshi..? Got it Tell me dear I want to speak to you personally About what dear? Not on the phone Amma Let me know the place I will come over In a few minutes time I will be visiting the Lord Veerabadra Swamy Temple near Dalavai School Can you meet me there? Yes You know mine & her names & zodiac signs Just include the names of we both in the rituals Amma Please don't mind Can I ask you something? Please Everytime you would include all the family members name in the rituals Why is it that today you have excluded your Son & Daughter-in-law's names? They both passed away in an accident Very sorry to hear I didn't know the matter So I asked Thats alrite May the Lord give peace to their soul And give courage to you Even if he doesn't give peace to their souls Giving me courage is enough Amma must have been furious from inside But the priest was confused Me & Amma were silent till we finished the offering Then I initiated the conversation Amma My apologies can't change what has already happened Still I am asking you Please forgive me Getting the house sold without your consent I have caused you a lot of pain Sometimes I feel if the heart exists so that A lot of pain can be dumped into it I am asking you once again Please forgive me Let it be dear It's not your mistake I may have the pain of loosing my house But You understood that I was in pain Thats enough Rather than giving me children If God had given me affectionate hearts like you I would have been happier If time permits We shall meet again I will make a move Amma, Just a minute Please take this What is this? Its the cash that your Son has given me as comission for getting your house sold Comission is the income & ethics of our profession But in this instance More than comission, Repentence would be my payment I don't know where you will be heading in the future But, Please do call me if you need anything If not in your hapiness Please do remember me in your tough times Bless me That was the last time I saw Amma The next time I met her was After I read an Advertisement in the newspaper stating a 3BHK is To-Let After I went to the Old-Age home to discuss about the rental home is when I got to know that She was the Sudha Murthy, who had posted the advertisement in the news paper While discussing, when I mentioned 3 boys & a girl Amma called you over to the Old-Age home Is it? Yes Only after you fell down out of dizziness at the Old-Age home that I learned about your association with Amma But, After selling your house You were supposed to travel to North India How did you end up at the Old-Age Home? After vaccating the house We all headed to the Airport But the car landed directly at this Old-Age home Amma Let me tell you clearly You are not taking me along with you From now on, I will have to stay at this Old-Age home This was planned earlier If this was told to me earlier I wouldn't have agreed to sell the house Nor would I have agreed to travel with you Now the 3BHK house registered in my name has to be let-out The rental income from it & my pension will be my source of living In case of any emergency You will be there to take care of me from a distance Don't worry Stay peacefully Right?

You guys can understand Why we have lit up a petromax along with lamps in front of God's picture ' Ottu Shavige ' & ' Petromax ' See where these two have lead us to Therefore, Ottu Shavige is in today's menu Another noticable thing is Milk soilled on the stove & tears spilled out of Amma's eyes ' Life ' & ' Ligth ' Can be seen together in my life Real estate agents are considered to be The ones who, for the lure of comission make people sell their homes & make them homeless This is the proof that even they illuminate many homes & hearts I am also a proof I have a small request Whether it is Son & Daughter-in-law Or In-Laws Or Sister-In-Law - Brother-In-Law Whoever it may be Don't try to dominate because Youth & Authority is on your side Home should feel like Home & not a graveyard Respect the elders Love the young ones Treat your Mother-In-Law like a Mother Treat your Daughter-In-Law like a Daughter If not Inspite of the entire family staying together Everyone will be an ' Orphan ' Think over And a suggestion from me Think well before having kids Your absence shouldn't make your kids Orphans Also, Kids shouldn't feel as orphans inspite of your presence I have 2 things to say Many things that can be sorted out home end up in the court People who don't bend in front of your family members Bend in front of strangers in the court Is this required?
