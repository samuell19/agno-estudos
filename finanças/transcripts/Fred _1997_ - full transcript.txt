TO MARIE-LOUISE… Michel? Yeah! Come on up. Coming. - What are you up to? - Aren't you asleep? With all I have to do tomorrow? All this crap, in this heat. It's the pits. Even without the heat, it's the pits. We weren't building Versailles. Those were different times. Nowadays, it's grab the money and run. Sure, take my beer. I'll go get another. - Hi, Corinne. - Hi. Did I wake you up, honey? Weren't you at your mother's? - I figured you would come home. - And, here I am. What are you up to? Nothing. - Will you be here tomorrow morning? - I don't think so. Okay, get off to bed, my lovely. How's things with your mom? Not great right now. Pity. Goodnight, daddy. You don't usually park out front. Yeah, I'm leaving right away. Where are you going? What are you, a cop? How about you, man? No sign of a job? - I'm getting plenty of mail. - Really? Yeah, mostly taxes and final reminders to pay. Motherfuckers. If you could wait a bit for the 3,000 bucks. Give them to the kid. I already owe two months allowance to her mother. - Oh, okay. - Yeah, all right. Shit, crane operators like you aren't easy to find. Yeah, so they say. It pisses me off because I dreamed I was at the controls. And you, are you okay? I get by. I don't have much choice. That's just how things are. In my family, we've been getting by for three generations. Hello? What about Lisa? Everything okay? - I guess I'm lucky. - Yeah, I guess. Right then, I'll be going. Here, I got you something. - What is it? - Look inside. See that little light at the back? In the north, it's called the end of the tunnel. Funny, right? Very kind of you. - You all right? - Never better. Bye. Do you need anything? If I do, I'll call you. Bye, buddy. Bye. Bruno? Was that you calling just now? Yeah. Say, for 8,000 bucks, aren't you taking me for a bit of a fool? Where were you? Over at Michel's. His truck woke me up. - His truck? - Yes. Fred, what are you doing? I'm sleeping. Were you drunk last night? No. What are we eating tonight? Be honest, are you only here for my ass and my food? To be honest, I'm not sure. Watch it, you. You think you're funny? No. Idiot. Fred, come finish the Lego. - Coming. - Give your mom a kiss first? - I'm very popular this morning. - Yes. I've got to get going. Do you have any cash? Yes, I think I have about 15 bucks in my pants. Take them. - No, don't worry, I'll manage. - Take them. I'm telling you I'll manage. Kevin, your dad is coming to get you. What time is he gonna be here? As soon as he can. Goodbye, my love. Fred! - What is it? - If he isn't here at 10:00 a.m... Yes, if he's not here, I'll take him to daycare. See you tonight. - Hello. - Hi, Corinne. Hold on a second. Where are you going, Fred? I'll be right back. Michel? He's not here. - Apologies yet again. - No problem. You okay, champ? Go around that side. I'll drop him off at the park after lunch. Could you… - Well, okay, why not. - Thank you. Goodbye, Fred. PLEASE WAIT… TRANSACTION CANCELED Useless piece of crap. Your unemployment benefit is two months late. I'll let you have a small overdraft, a very tiny one. Not too small, though. Go get the balls, guys! - You… - Come on! Come on! Good morning. - Good morning. - I want to get this analyzed. My chick told me it's dangerous. - Your chick. - My girlfriend? My wife told me it was dangerous. She's right. Michel called. He'll call you at home at 1:00 p.m. Really? Okay. Here, this is for the groceries. Can't you get them? Sure, but what do I get? Salted pork. Okay, salted pork. - I'll go myself. - Thanks. What can I do to make you happy? Tell me. Give me a raise. Do you always think about money? Shit. - Hello? - It's Michel. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. - I have a little job for you. - Are you kidding? - No. I need a favor. - Right now? - Are you free? - I always am these days. - Okay. Remember that truck? - Yes. - I left it in Ventilles. - Near the stadium. - How do you know that? - I happened to pass by there. I need you to take it to the place I'll tell you about. It can't be far. I have to be here at 4:00 p.m. for the kid. No, it will be fine. Can you drive a big beast like that? - You're joking. No worries. - Good. You know the closet in my room? Near the bottom, there's a pair of red socks. The keys are inside. - Inside the socks? - Yeah. I'll give you the route. What have you made? A drawing. - What's that? - An elephant. That's not an elephant, it's a horse. It's an elephant. Of course it is, silly me. - What did you do today? - I drove a big truck. - As big as the Lego? - Much bigger. A hundred times bigger. - A truck like the ones on the highway. - Oh, yes. Big trucks with a steering wheel this big. Come here. - That's enough now! - Don't worry, we're just playing. Go up to your room. It's time for bed. If you think I like doing housework at 10:00 p.m., you're wrong. At the moment, I'm the one doing the housework. - And other than that, what did you do? - Nothing, as usual. Don't say "nothing". I called. Nobody was home. I gave Michel a hand. He drove a big truck! - Did you drive a truck? - Yes. - Is this a joke? - If you think it is, why do you ask? Kevin, go up to your room. Well done. Get off my back. Six months ago, you had no job and I didn't say a word. - Have you forgotten that? - I wasn't drinking. Two or three beers is drinking? You're so unfair, Lisa, it's unbelievable. Are you on your period? Cut the crap. You disappear all day and I'm the one who's premenstrual? - What a convenient excuse. - You're just tired. Hello. Michel here, leave a message. Thank you. Do you have the keys to Michel's? No, it was open. Is he in trouble? No. Tell me if I'm bothering you. Do you want to sit here for a bit? Look, I know I'm a pain in the ass. My mother was always nagging my father. When he came home late, she assumed he was cheating on her. But it was worse than that. He was always out with his pals. You're right, that's worse. But I know a trick no friend can ever do. Do you want me to show you? Watch out, my cigarette. This is a great sofa. It's firmer than mine, isn't it? - It's just that yours makes a noise. - You're right. Watch out! If Corinne comes in… Turn off the light. Turn it off! You're crazy! Wait, it's stuck! Ouch! - Where are you going? - I'm going to check something. Did I wake you up? No. Go to sleep. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. - Fred. - Everything okay? - Yes. - What's wrong? Nothing, I thought I heard the little one crying. Hi, Jacky. A Martini. - Seen Michel recently? - No. Thank you. Hello, warriors! "Warriors", very funny. You're an activist, you read Libération and think that makes you a revolutionary. I was kidding. Stop it, Yvan. - I'm allowed to talk, ain't I? - Guess about what? Right. Because if you hadn't pushed us into occupying the factory, we might still have a job! You're crazy. You start something, you have to see it through. It's easy for you to give advice! You're working! Where did you get that idea? What do you mean? I mean that His Lordship is a driver now! He has a nice white truck. - Jacky, tell him to lay off me. - Hey, it's the truth, isn't it? Weren't you showing off that big ass truck of yours yesterday? Yup, bigger than your wife's ass. - Cut it out! - They're both crazy. Stop or I'll call the police! That's enough! - Fuck. Asshole. I'm bleeding. - Let me see. Here. - Stop it! - Here we go again. - All you had to do was hide. - You should have warned me. - Leave it to me. - Whatever. So, these joints… …they're not yours? - No, sir, I swear. - Do you often have 800 francs in cash? It's my mother's unemployment. Mouloud, I know your mother. She's never worked. So… She'll be getting it soon! I swear it's true. If he says it's his mother's unemployment, what can we do? I'll book them and be right back. I know you. We've met before. Six months ago. Same place, same story. - Perhaps. - What? Could be. Have you nothing better to do than fight? Well, no, that's the problem. We have nothing else to do. Do you want to file a complaint? No. Nor does the other guy. It is me that should be complaining. For pissing us off and wasting our time. If you were kids, I would understand. Were you drunk? Not yet. Well. I'll keep you in until midnight. To piss you off and waste your time. Okay? It's your turn now. Have a nice evening. Michel? Corinne? He's got nothing left, the asshole. Why are you here? I just dropped by. Where's Michel? No idea. Didn't you see him tonight? No. Yesterday neither. I was at Pachouba. I came back on my Vespa. Damn, that club is a dump. - Do you never go there? - No, where is it? "Where is it". Oh, shit! Your hands are cold! It's the bike. I always takes me ages to warm up again. My head is spinning. I'll say goodnight to Lisa for you. You're not even funny. Fred! Yes? Where have you been? - What? - Where have you been? Nowhere. I got a mail from ANPE for a job. I have to go see them. Great, but where have you been? At the police station. The police station? - Who were you fighting this time? - With Yvan. Nothing serious. Look at me. It was nothing. Really. Don't you two ever get tired of it? It really sucks. - You never got into a fight? - Not like that. Once I kicked a guy who was following me in the balls. It felt weird on my foot. I'm actually really glad I'm a woman. I get why you're scared walking around with that between your legs. It's so fragile. That's why they need to be caressed so often! Exactly. What are you doing here? - Am I bothering you? Are you cleaning? - Yes. I only have the vacuuming left. - What brand is it? - A Hoover, the only real ones. Come in. I want to apologize for yesterday. It was stupid of me. It was me, I started it. You know, since the factory closed, there are 200 of us feeling like idiots. Of course. Don't just stand there, come on in! Why don't we go for a drink instead? Just a lemonade. What do you say? I'll just do my nails and be right there. Those assholes kept me in till midnight. I have two kids so they gave me a dressing-down and let me go. If you're single, they treat you like shit. - You're not single. - For the police, I am. You're not the only one to piss everybody off. If you're gonna be a pain in the ass you can drink your lemonade on your own. - No one will ever change you. - Not you, anyway. - Yvan, where you are going? - What do you mean? I mean, where you are going? I'm going to look at a crane with Fred. Okay? Where are we going? To Jacky's? - Hang on, he'll lecture us. - You're crazy. We should have been building that. All the rain must have pissed them off. - You know the factory has been sold? - Really? Yeah. The mayor assigned it as a sort of recreation center. Why are you stopping? - Wanna take a look? - Why? I don't know. No particular reason. Does it bother you? No, okay, let's go. Up there, that was my studio. Did you see how they gutted it all? You could say it makes it nice and airy! We weren't spoiled for windows. Let's take a look at it. Isn't this cool? Let's do a tour of the premises. Moron. It will only depress you. Like everything else. PLANT OCCUPIED, SOLIDARITY, ALL ON STRIKE ACTION AND UNION TO FIGHT BACK It's falling apart, isn't it? My workshop was right there. What a mess. We worked like slaves in here. But it was better than doing housework. That's for sure. - Don't get too close. - Are you feeling dizzy? Wanna go for a drink? Just come on. Come here. Let's go. - Are you coming or what? - Yeah. Come on, buddy! What are you guys up to? What are we up to? Who does he think he is? Fuck you. You too! Get the fuck off me! Don't fucking move! Knock it off! Let him go, damn it! No! No! Shit, are you fucking crazy? - Let's get out of here! - Let me go! You are through to the police. Hold the line. You are through to the police. Hold the line. - Fuck! - Police here, how can I help you? A bag. Shit! My card. What are you doing here? - Aren't you at your mother's? - Look at your face. You look scary. - Go to your mother's. - You can't say that. You're not my father. Ok, but grab your stuff and go to your mother's! - Okay. - And get moving. - Did anyone call for your father? - My grandmother. Why? - Apart from that? - Someone called Bruno. That's all. - What did he want? - I have no idea! - What's going on? - No, nothing. Come on. I'm warning you, we can't be late. Yeah, right in the face. He's home. Michel? - He's not here. - He's behaving stupidly lately. He's left the place open. Hi, Michel here. Leave a message. Thank you. Hello, it's Fred. Hope you listen to this. I need to talk to you. See you at the Foosball. Know which one? You absolutely must come. I'll wait for you over there. Okay? Bye. I'd like to talk to Lisa, please. He didn't mean to kill him. Yvan that went ballistic. And what about the truck? It was a small job. It may have nothing to do with it. Do you realize what you're saying? A guy is dead. Why don't you go to the cops? You did nothing! So they can lock me up? I would never get out. I just need to find out some info so they believe me. And what do I do? Tell them I left to find a job. The ANPE thing. I'll go tomorrow. I might find a job. Everything ok? Isn't it obvious? Why is he hassling us? I just wanted to know if... You don't want anything! You're pissing us off! Go and play with your test tubes! Get lost! - Is he still bothering you? - No, it's all right. He's a boss. Yes, that's the way. Do you have any money? Don't worry. I'll get by. You have a hard-on! Where are you going? To E4. I took a truck there the other day. No, no-one is allowed here except the trucks. I want to check the load. It's forbidden, I told you. Are you deaf? - Do you take me for a fool? - Hands off me! Intervention E4-E5, send reinforcements. Okay, I'm on my way. You're not so cocky now. - Hi, Jumbo! - Hello. - A half. - Right away. Hi, Fred! Everything okay? - Have you seen Michel at all? - No. Why? Did he do this to you? - Hi, guys! - Hi, Geneviève. - Want a game? - No. - Come on, just a quick one! - No, I said! - Come on, let me school you. - Go on, sudden death. Sudden death? Fuck, you're a hard man! Not too sudden, though. Fred, Michel on the phone! Hello? Where are you? - Why? What's happening? - Yvan is dead. Yvan? He's dead? Ever since I shifted your truck, all hell has broken loose. What do you mean, he's dead? We were at the factory, he wanted to see his workshop again. We had a fight with two bastards who killed him. Everyone will think I killed him, because we had a fight yesterday. Hello? Hello? Michel! - Who are these guys? - I don't know! They were in a van at your house. Shit, Fred. Go to the cops. And tell them what? Everything you know. - Hi Jeanne, how are you? - What about you? - You don't look good. - I'm fine. Have you seen Michel? Yes, this morning. He was as bust up as you are. Did you party together last night? Did he say anything in particular? He didn't mention you, anyway. When? What did he do, exactly? You're acting strange! He ate something and made a call. Who did he call? A guy. Who? Do you know his name? Yes, why? So why don't you tell me? I'm done with all your fucking secrets. He never tells me anything either. It's shit! There's nothing to say. I just want the name. Mandor. His name is Mandor. Bruno Mandor? Yes. Happy? Is that what you wanted? - Do you need a ride? - I'm okay. - Not going home? Where will you sleep? - I'll be fine. Last night, I was drunk. You can come over. I won't eat you. Right, show me your sad, puppy-dog eyes, I love that. Thank you. The tuna sandwiches have gone bad. Leave the keys at the corner shop. Say hello to Lisa for me. Yeah. What does this guy do? Mandor? He worked at the factory. What kind of work? A bit of everything. Michel worked for him. At least, I think so. Remember the ANPE thing. - Ah, yes, shit. - Go tomorrow. It would be dumb not to go. - Okay. - Promise? Well… …I want to say so many things. Me too. Lots and lots. Bye. It's almost time to go to bed. Yes. Kevin, where is your bike? Outside. Sorry, I scared you. These houses all look the same. - Are you Lisa Mandini? - Yes. Your friend, I mean your boyfriend, Frédéric Capber, is he at your place? No. He went to look for work. - When did he leave? - At 12:00 p.m. One of his colleagues had a fall at the factory. - I heard. - Did you know he died? And you also know that they had a fight yesterday. - That was nothing. - Of course it wasn't! But it's weird that he's not here, right? What do you want me to do about it? Aren't you inviting me in? No. The kid is sleeping. Anyway, at this time of day, it's no time for paying visits anyway. Well, listen. I don't consider Fred to be public enemy number one. I would just like him to come and see me. This has even my home address. He already knows the one for the police station. Goodbye. Goodnight. Frédéric Capber! Good morning. I have nothing for a crane operator. Have you already worked on the 7-88? - No, but I could. Doesn't seem too hard. - I saw your CV. You should be okay. It is a new site. There is no room for error. Show me what you can do. - You better be good. - Why? I saw that you occupied the premises of your last employers. Is that on file? I didn't do it because it was fun. I only read the files, I don't write them. Pick up three or four beams over there and stack them neatly, without breaking anything. One by one. Okay. Hello. Hello. My colleague would like you to call him. Are you pressuring me? He's just turning the screws. You won't forget to call him? I never forget anything. Your front light is broken. Good morning, madam. Good morning. - I hope I'm not disturbing. - Are you from Ventilles? Yeah, how do you know that? Just by chance. That's the only way I ever find out anything around here. Tea? I'm looking for Mr. Mandor. He's gone, Mr. Mandor. Hightailed it in the night. Do you know this guy? He wouldn't have stolen a truck, would he? Could be. He's very good, Mandor, at covering up the big bosses' crap. In those cases, does he call on some guys in a van? Juvisy's thugs! They would do anything for 2,000 bucks. Who are these guys? I don't know their names and I don't care. Well, I do. They killed someone. I don't want to go to jail for them. I don't know everything but I know where Mr. Mandor stashes his stuff. - What kind of stuff? - No idea. I never dared to look for fear of seeing photos of his bitches. Get out of here, please! - The stairs behind the kitchen! - There? - Where the hell is he? - Get back out that way! Yes, hold on. - This is the Jacquard Laboratory. - It's me. - Fred? - Can you join me when you're done? - Yes, but where? - A motel. Write down the address. Yes. Go on. The one we saw once near the A86. - Miss! - Yes, just a moment. What about the ANPE job? - I went there. - Yes. I did the test, it went well but they were like, "We'll contact you." - There were seven of us. - I can't talk to you now. - You coming? I'll be waiting. - Yes, I'm coming. Friday, at 3:30 p.m. Is that okay? That's fine. Goodbye. Thank you. Come in. I'm soaking wet. I'll be right back. I brought you some clean clothes. - Thank you. Where's Kevin? - His dad will bring him back at 10:00 p.m. - Are you all right? - Yes, I'm okay. How did you come? By taxi. Fifty bucks. You know how it is. How did you pay for the hotel? I maxed my credit card. No, I wasn't really scared. - You remember that storm three years ago? - Yeah. I was in my crane, 30 meters in the air, and the wind suddenly started gusting. I've never been sailing but it must be like that, in a storm. I should have been scared to death. But I had something to do. I had to move this three-ton beam hanging on the end of my lever. It's all in the wrists. I put it down like a feather. There is nothing to freak out about. It's when you have nothing to do that you get scared. This is the first time that you invite me to a hotel. You're not hard to please. On the contrary. I am very picky. I don't really see it, your pal Michel. When I first met you, I heard all about your big mouth! Only one person stood up for you. It was Michel. I know. What are you going to do? I don't know. You told someone I was here? No, nobody. Shit! It must have been that asshole, Jacquard. That fucker rummages in my desk. - What do you mean? - I must have left the address around. Fuck this! Good thing I stashed my bike. Damn, I had a feeling! Those bastards! Give me my jacket. Quick! Where will we meet? At the station, okay? Bye! - Is he in there? - No. He left. He has done nothing. He's scared of going to jail. - We'll see. - Did Jacquard warn you? You have good accomplices. You're talking to me about accomplices? Very funny! But if you continue this little game, I'll take you into custody. Two cyclists saw him yesterday near the factory. I get here, he leaves. I have to run after him as if he was guilty. - It doesn't look good for him. - It always looks bad for the same people. - I'm a cop, not God. - That's lucky. As for God, fuck him. Amen to that. Well, have you seen the cop? - Yeah, I saw him. - Well? - You know I have his home address. - What difference does that make? A cop never gives out his address. He's a good guy, Fred. Good or not, cops put folk behind bars. It gives me the creeps, understand? People like us, when we do, we get screwed big time. No one will care how long I stay there! I'd rather see you in jail than six feet under. I want you to get out of this mess. Can't you understand that? Fred, I'm scared you'll do something stupid. You think I'm enjoying this? I thought you might be. Tell me, what do you want me to do? I want you to talk to that cop. Not at the police station. At his house, you risk less. Just talk to him. That's all. This guy is impossible. What do you want? Ah, yes. Come in. Join me? No. It's good that you came. Well, I mean, it's better for you. We'll… Let's talk, ok? - Have a seat. - There? That's right. So, here I am. It's what you wanted. It's Lisa who... Great, the TGV. The modern world right under the nose of the Middle Ages. With its tribes, its vandals, its officials. It's not the town, it's not the countryside… It's all just shit. For you too. It's all just shit. So… What's the story? What do you mean the story? It's a story about... Hey! Hey? You could tell me anything, I'd have forgotten it an hour from now. Come on, let me go. I'll sleep for a bit and we'll start over later. - Let me go! - Yes. - Hey! - Hey. Come on. I'm going to sleep now. Hey. Hello, it's me. Leave a message, thank you. Hello? It's Lisa. We met earlier at the motel. Are you there? I wanted to know if Frédéric Capber was at your place. Call me back, thank you. Hello? Hello, is Lisa there? No, not yet. - Who's this? - Antoine Jacquard. Is it you? Asshole. - Did you get her? - No, she must be on her way to work. - Pity. - What am I supposed to do with these? Keep them. They look good on you. Yes, they're exactly my size. - Hello. - Hello. - No one called for me? - No, why? Nothing. Do you know young Weber came back for his HIV test? Really? Did you cut yourself? Yes, I was shaving. You're crazy! Better than being a piece of shit. You're lucky it's not tainted blood. Next time, I'll give you AIDS and hepatitis C combined. Fuck off and leave us in peace. - You two are completely crazy! - We're fine actually, thanks. You're fired! I can make it impossible for you to find things on this. Right? So, let me work in peace. Come on. Does your pal Michel have family? A girlfriend? I believe he has several. Let's start at the beginning. Fuck, I already told you everything twice! Now, it's enough. Yes, but I still want more. Do you want it in back-slang this time? A truck parked at your place while you were sleeping, right? And then? RECEPTION Then… I came to see you. You were completely wasted. Not a bad story. Not bad at all, but not enough to get you off the hook. It looks like a drunken brawl that ended badly. Pity. I had hoped you would come up with a better bullshit story. Come on, let's go! If you would only give me one good reason to believe you. Alright. How about I tell you I'm too stupid to have made it all up? Would that do? Sentinel One, this is Sentinel Four. Go ahead, Sentinel Four. Can you check out a blue Ford Transit, 89 Golf Alfa Romeo 91? Affirmative, 89 Golf Alfa Romeo 91, vehicle registered to a Juvisy company that went bankrupt three years ago. Thanks, over and out. - I told you... - I know, three times! - I only drink in the evenings. I'm ok now. - I hope so. - Are you the one in charge here? - Yes. Did someone come by to take a truck at E4? I do my best. There are only two of us for over 40 warehouses. - Who owns E4? - I don't know. The trucks come in and out, what are you here for? I'm gonna drag your ass to court. What's Mandor's wife like? A beautiful woman, a little worn out. She didn't look well. And me, how do I look? What can I say? Nothing. Say nothing. I told you that when I went into Michel's room, he was moaning about cracks in the ceiling. - So? - Maybe that has something to do with it. That's it. - What is it? - I'm not an engineer. - What the heck is that? - Construction panel designs. Okay, on our way. Hello, I'd like to see Frédéric Capber. I think he's here. - Nobody by that name here. - He must be with Inspector Barrère. I'd like to see him. The inspector hasn't come in. My boyfriend went to his house last night! What can I say? Either he's here, or he's with Inspector Barrère. I'm not budging from here. Got it? You need to calm down. Look into it if you want me to calm down. I trusted you, do something, dammit! Where is the other inspector? The Arab-looking one? Good morning. Would you follow me? I can't get through to Inspector Barrère. I know. Sit down. We can't reach him either. It's quieter in here. What does your friend do? - Nothing. - I meant before. He was crane operator. A good one, I believe. - He worked at the factory, right? - Yes. How long have you been living here? One year. And your child, how old is he? Five years old. I started young. I have a three-month-old baby. - Three months? - Yes. - Does he sleep at night? - No, it's a nightmare! You finally called Barrère. I was the one who told Fred to go see him. - Was it the right move? - Yes, of course. Nouchi, two brats have fallen off the roof of the mall. You know one of them. I'm on my way. Please go. I'm on it. - Hey, you've really put on the beef! - You can have it back whenever you like. Okay, explain it to him. - These, for example. - Yes? I don't know what they are. It's sets of 500 PRO construction panels. It is 60% asbestos fiber cement. Come over here. Oh my God. It's been banned for ages. In any case, normally, we only use it in large structures. These were in ordinary houses. Some clowns will do anything with salvage materials. What about money? With this shit, you could increase margins by 40%. But if you're caught, you're in big trouble. - Have you ever handled panels like this? - Maybe. - What is the factory going to become? - A leisure and nature center. If there's asbestos there and ecologists show up, that would be a mess. Maybe Mandor had to get rid of it. And he asked Michel to take care of the clear-up. For sure. And he'll get Mandor to own up. I'm a cop, after all. Wait! Stop! What day is it? Friday. That's Corinne's bike. She should be at school. - Who is Corinne? - Michel's daughter. I have to talk to her for a minute. Can I? - Are you waiting for someone? - My dad. Do you mind? When is he due? He couldn't say. He has a meeting somewhere near here. But then we're leaving to go on a trip. I'm warning you. - Do you know where his meeting is? - Not exactly. I think it's at the factory. Why? - I gotta go. - Won't you wait for him? No, I can't. - I thought Michel had no family. - The girl has nothing to do with this. Shit! Unbelievable! Stop doing that! In case you've kept anything else from me, I'd rather be sure you're here waiting for me. Aren't you calling the police? You know how to recognize a good cop? By his freedom of movement. Shit! Asshole. PLANT OCCUPIED, SOLIDARITY, ALL ON STRIKE Hello! Shit! Wait, I would… Fuck! Shit! Nouchi to Barrère, call Unit One. Nouchi to Barrère... For fuck's sake, Fred. I screwed everything up. Can you drive? Yeah, move over. You really screwed them over. We have to call Corinne at her mother's. Okay, we will. Her number is 60-42-29-66. My mother. Her number is 60-32-15-11. Her sister.

Can I sit down? I'm waiting for someone. Go ahead. Who are you waiting for, if you don't mind me asking? The ambulance, the cops, my wife. No one in particular. Subtitles: Arianna Martini, Lorna Ciani
