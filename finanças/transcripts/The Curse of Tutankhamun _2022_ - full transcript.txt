An English archaeological expedition headed by a man named Howard Carter sought to uncover the tomb of an ancient Egyptian Pharaoh, King Tutankhamun. November 1922. After years of searching, a tomb is unearthed. Hanging over the excavation party was a pall of superstition that threatened the progress of the expedition at every turn. A long-lost pharaoh disturbed and desecrated. They thought that Egypt so stuffed full of artifacts that they could just go there, dig a hole, and take whatever they wanted and it really, really didn't matter. A deadly curse, thousands of years old, is awakened. And it absolutely runs like wildfire. Those who entered are in grave peril from the Curse of Tutankhamun. Within a few weeks, his father had thrown himself out of a window. A century has passed since the tomb of the world's most famous pharaoh was discovered, Tutankhamun. Tutankhamun, yeah, he wasn't an important guy. He wasn't an important pharaoh. He died very young. He didn't rule for very long. It's absolutely bizarre, in a way, that he should end up the most famous of all the pharaohs. 2019, a London exhibition of Tutankhamun's treasures attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors. It remains the greatest archaeological find of all time. But with Tutankhamun, you've got everything. You've got the mummy, the death mask, and all of his treasures. And... and the treasures are weirdly intimate things, you know, his walking sticks, because he was lame, his games, his toys. There are some boomerangs here. We know him. We... we know him and we love him. Ancient Egypt was the first visually compelling and beautiful civilization. It's incredible. It comes out of the Stone Age. And it evolves by the Nile in this kind of very organic way. And they produce true beauty and sublimity actually, grandeur, aesthetic grandeur, maybe for the first time in human civilization. Certainly, the discovery of... Of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922 attracts attention still, because it was an archaeological adventure. There's a sense of the intrepid, a sense of real glamour, again, because of the time that it happened, in the 1920s. So it's not simply what they found. It was the manner that it was found in and the way that is framed, the way it was photographed, the way it was sold in the popular press. But the world's fascination with Tutankhamun has always been tinged with fear and danger. The notion of a curse, the vengeance of a long dead pharaoh persists. It's beautiful. It's powerful. It's great art. But there's some kind of idea in it, which is really intense, that this... A real belief that this stuff matters. And... and it is meant to have magical power. And so maybe there is just something spooky and slightly inexplicable about Egyptian art and the Egyptian dead that does make us, you know, believe in curses and mummies and so forth. Widespread enthusiasm for ancient Egypt began over 200 years ago. The Europeans had a very kinda clear taste that was nearly all classical, so Roman and Grecian. And they thought that Egyptian sculpture was just... And architecture... was just awful, tasteless, primitive. And that totally changed in 1798, when Napoleon invaded Egypt. And there was a sudden kind of rush of awareness about the extraordinary culture that was there and rotting away in the deserts. And when that stuff started coming in massive quantities to Europe, then there was a sudden burst of what we now call Egyptomania. It's a bit strange, because some of them brought back mummies. And you know, you wouldn't normally think of going on holiday and bringing back human remains as a souvenir, but they did this. And it wasn't even unknown to have a mummy unwrapping party. And people would come and watch the mummy be unwrapped. ROBERT LUCKHURST So you would go to the Royal Institution in 1830s and see a mummy, literally, disassembled, so unwrapped, chiseled away at, ripped apart. And what they're looking for, really, is the jewels that are bound into the wrappings of the mummy. Ancient Egypt intrigues us, fascinates us, horrifies us, because of the status of mummified flesh. And that chance to, rightly or wrongly, see the face of an ancient Egyptian, the preserved flesh of an ancient Egyptian, puts Egypt in a special category. That fired the imagination in a way between real rapture at seeing this and excitement and revulsion. By the mid-19th century, popular fiction was feeding this twin fascination. So in 1869, we have Louisa May Alcott, most famous for writing "Little Women," writes a short story called "Lost in a Pyramid." And "Lost in a Pyramid" not only has a mummy, but it has the first time a curse. And mummies and curses thereafter seemed to go hand-in-hand. I think, far and away, the more influential piece is Arthur Conan Doyle's "Lot No. 249." And in that, we have the first real representation of an enormous bandaged juggernaut of a mummy battering its way through the leafy countryside of Oxfordshire and killing people in its way. By the end of the 19th century, ancient Egypt was attracting a new wave of professional archaeologists, including Howard Carter. The first Egyptologists were basically, I think what we'd classify today, almost as tomb robbers. They thought that Egypt was so stuffed full of artifacts that they could just go there, dig a hole, and take whatever they wanted and it really, really didn't matter. But about the time that Howard Carter came, there was a definite change. Things became more scientific. And Howard Carter seems to have adapted very well to that new approach to Egyptology. We don't get the sense that he went in ripping things apart, just looking for that one particular find that... that would be worth, you know, thousands. Carter first arrived in Egypt in 1891, working on archaeological digs as a painter. Howard Carter was an artist and a very good artist. His father was an artist too. And he became interested in ancient Egypt, because he had a neighbor who had an extensive Egyptian collection. He immediately fell in love with the country and became recognized as a gifted Egyptologist. Carter had a massive career boost. He moved suddenly from just being somebody who... Who excavated and did artistic work to becoming an inspector of the antiquities service. He went to Luxor and became in charge of all the archaeological sites in southern Egypt. And he did a really good job. The archaeological jewel of southern Egypt was the Valley of the Kings, the burial site of 18th dynasty pharaohs. So that's an area in western Thebes and modern Luxor. It's behind a range of... of hills, the Theban Mountains. But behind these set of hills, there's this quiet area, the Place of Truth, where the kings are actually buried. But archaeologists had unearthed few artifacts from the pharaoh's tombs in the Valley. Ancient Egyptian grave robbers had beaten Western treasure hunters to it by millennia. The Valley of the Kings was home to a lot of royal tombs. And these tombs were repeatedly robbed. They were robbed pretty soon after the burials of the kings. Everyone knew that the tombs in the Valley of the King had been emptied. For almost a hundred years, people had been looking at them. They'd been finding tombs, finding nothing in them. But Howard Carter was convinced there was one pharaoh's tomb that hadn't been robbed. Howard Carter knew the list of the kings of the 18th dynasty. And he knew that some of those kings had a tomb. Some also had a body, because collections of royal bodies had been found. So he was able to go down the list and say, well, this king has a tomb. And this king has a body. And this king has both. The only king who Carter would've expected to be buried in the Valley and who had neither a body nor a tomb was Tutankhamun. So Howard Carter knew that he was missing. And if he was going to look for an 18th dynasty king, it would be Tutankhamun. Tutankhamun was one of the last pharaohs of 18th dynasty royalty. His reign lasted little more than a decade. Tutankhamun came to the throne at a very strange time. His predecessor, Akhenaten, had decided to change the whole focus of the monarchy and had worshipped just one god, the Aten, the sun disk. Tutankhamun, when he came to the throne, reversed that decision. We know that he came to the throne at about eight years of age. And we know that after he'd done this, the old gods were reinstated. So, if you like, he's a King who restores Egypt. We also know that he married his sister or his stepsister. But beyond that, we don't a great deal about him. By his late teens, the young pharaoh was dead. Tutankhamun's reign was never forgotten. There were statues of Tutankhamun and his... his name was... Was dotted about Egypt. But his tomb was forgotten. There was a massive flood in the Valley of the Kings. The bottom of the Valley, where Tutankhamun was buried, was covered in a layer of mud. And it was essentially forgotten. But to find Tutankhamun's tomb required money and plenty of it. What Howard Carter needed was a sponsor. The 5th Earl of Carnarvon is normally portrayed as the financier behind Howard Carter and the discovery of Tutankhamun, a... a playboy who sort of threw money at it. And that's about it. After a near-fatal car accident, Lord Carnarvon began spending his winters in Egypt, a country under British control. Egypt was this playground, really, for wealthy Europeans. And you would have aristocrats swanning around, lots of journalists, lots of military people, lots of writers, and socialites. So it was a whole social scene. As Cairo's colonial club life wore thin, Lord Carnarvon began to show an interest in Egyptology. Lots of people are interested in Egyptology, because they think that the Egyptians have a knowledge that we're lacking. Particularly in our very scientific, very modern age, there's a feeling that maybe the people of the past, the Egyptians with their mysterious mummies and pyramids and so on, actually had an understanding that we are lacking today. Part of this process is the idea of the curse, that they could create a curse that would have effect many, many years later. By 1917, Lord Carnarvon had teamed up with Howard Carter and purchased the rights to excavate in the Valley of the Kings. The search for Tutankhamun had begun. They made an ideal team, because one had the expertise and one had the money. And they started to work together. In the shadows of the silent sphinx and the gigantic pyramids that stood as lonely sentinels over the vast stretch of burning sand, an English archaeological expedition, headed by a man named Howard Carter, sought to uncover the tomb of an ancient Egyptian Pharaoh, King Tutankhamun. Howard Carter's archives are now held at the Griffith's Institute in Oxford. So this is Howard Carter's map of a section of the Valley of the Kings. It's written up here, "Valley of the Kings by Carter." So Carter gridded up this section of the Valley. And he was asking his men to dig down to bedrock in every square. And he's drawn in the tombs that they already knew about and also some of the geological features. Also got the tomb of Ramesses VI here, which was a very large tomb. So Carter's map here is kind of indicative of the way that he worked, in that he's... He's gridded everything up very carefully and he's methodically working through each square to make sure that he doesn't miss anything. Hanging over the excavation party was a pall of superstition that threatened the progress of the expedition at every turn. Fighting that feeling as well as the blazing desert sun, Carter ruled with an iron fist and was hard pressed to keep the work going. The English excavators, I think, tried to see themselves as scientists. And they knew that they were surrounded by Egyptian workers who had a set of beliefs that, really, this was transgressive in some way, that you were breaking into what was holy space. But five years of looking for the lost tomb of Tutankhamun delivered only disappointment. So as Carter's written here, in all of our excavation seasons, he started in 1917 and we've got '18, '19, '20, '21. They'd found very little for those five years that they'd been digging. And it was getting to the point where Carnarvon was running out of money. And things would've been quite tense. The pressure would've been on for Carter to try and find something to make all this excavation and all this... this money worthwhile. So in June 1922, Carnarvon and Carter sat down here, probably in his Egyptian room, amongst all the extraordinary collection and treasures. And Lord Carnarvon was saying to Howard Carter, I cannot continue to fund the expeditions in Egypt on an ongoing basis. And he needed to give him notice. So he said to Lord Carnarvon, look, I just have one square on my map left. Please, can I have one more season? He even offered to finance it himself. And then, I'm happy to say that there's nothing left in the value. So Lord Carnarvon, ever the gambler and ever the generous patron, said basically, OK. One last season. 1922 would be Carter's last chance to find Tutankhamun. So this is what we call Carter's pocket diary for... This is Egyptian season 1922, that, at the time, Carter believed would be his last season working in the Valley of the Kings. So 27th of October, 1922. "Left Cairo for Luxor." And he always writes quite neatly on the line. The 1st of November, 1922, he's just recorded "commenced excavations, B el M," Biban el-Moluk, which is the Valley of the Kings. And then, very quickly, we have on the 4th of November 1922, Carter's entry is one of the few where he's written across the page diagonally. And this is Howard Carter excited. And he's simply written "First steps of tomb found." And then, when he had time, he would write in his journal, which gives a much fuller account of what happened. This is the entry for November the 5th, 1922. "Towards sunset, we had cleared down to the level of the 12th step... "which was sufficient to expose a large part of the upper portion of the plaster and sealed doorway. Here, before us, was sufficient evidence to show that it really was an entrance to a tomb..." "and by the seals, to all outward appearances, that it was intact." So for Carter, this must've been something that he probably dare even dream about, to find a tomb that was still sealed. Beyond those 12 steps, descending through the bedrock to a sealed doorway, lay a passageway, which took Carter down to another sealed entrance, beyond which lay an antechamber, an annex, and the burial chamber. Throughout the tomb were references to the pharaoh buried inside, Tutankhamen. The morning that Carter first entered the tomb, a hawk was spotted flying above the excavation site. His Egyptian workforce considered it a bad omen. A mere four months later, the financier, Lord Carnarvon, would be dead. After five years of excavating Egypt's Valley of the Kings, archaeologist Howard Carter and his team had found the long-lost tomb of Tutankhamun. The Griffith's Institute houses over a thousand glass-plate photographs taken inside the tomb. So we have, in front of us, a glass negative, one of several thousand created by the photographer Harry Burton, who was assigned to Carter's team right from the beginning of the excavation. So this is the first room that they entered in the tomb of Tutankhamun. All of these objects were just as if they had been placed over 3,000 years ago. So on the left-hand side, you can see we have the dismantled chariots of the king for use in the afterlife. Then, moving round to the right, we can see two gilded couches, or three gilded couches, found in the tomb. And upon those couches are heaped furniture. So we have chairs and stools, as well as boxes, which contained items such as the King's garments, and also even a medicine set. Then, looking underneath the couches, we see even more furniture. We can just about see the throne of a king, child size. And then, moving along to the next couch, we can see these oval-shaped boxes, which were found to contain cuts of meat. So it's the first major archaeological find, really, to use photography in a very stylized way. We know the finding through the photographs. And it really was an aesthetic that, yes, Carter contributed to, but which Harry Burton invented. With thousands of grave goods to remove, catalog, and restore, the task ahead was monumental. Carter was prepared to take years, if necessary, because he wanted to do it correctly. Because he recognized that in excavating Tutankhamun's tomb, he would be destroying it. You could never recreate it. So he knew he had to get it absolutely right. So he did things that hadn't really been done before. He assembled a big team of experts. And he planned out a methodology, which was so good that we can still use his cards today to see what he was... found and where. On November 29th, 1922, the discovery was officially announced to the press. To a world ravaged by the Great War and Spanish Flu, the golden treasures cast a brilliant light when the public needed it most. The timing was good, I think, because it was after the War and it was also after the influenza epidemic. So the world really needed cheering up. And everybody loves a story of action and adventure and discovery and treasure. This is the beginning of the '20s. This is the beginning of the era of wealthy socialites and flappers and new freedoms and also of, kind of, decadence and the F. Scott Fitzgerald "Great Gatsby" era is beginning. And perhaps Tutankhamen, with his glitter and his bling and his youth, is the Jazz Age pharaoh. The delicate grave goods, over 3,000 years old, mesmerized, inspired, and enlightened. You're suddenly looking on the face of a king who hasn't been seen for thousands of years, his perfect tomb, his perfect treasure, his gorgeous art. And it was all to do with helping the soul or the... You know, the spirit to make its journey through the afterlife. There's nothing lacking from what the Egyptians could do in art. And that's what you really realize, I think, looking at Tutankhamun's treasures. It's a time capsule of a lost artistic wonderland, which must've been just incredible. One prominent journalist present at the opening of the tomb was Arthur Weigall. Arthur Weigall was, really, a rival Egyptologist to Howard Carter. So for years, he had been telling stories about the Valley of the Kings, about hauntings, about mysterious, vengeful events that were associated with particular tombs. So he was perfectly situated to tell a story about Tutankhamun. And he was employed by "The Daily Mail," at the news of the opening of the Tutankhamun tomb, to go out there and get as many stories as he could related to this. So he was kind of an authority figure and expert, but also someone who understood that sensational stories would really sell. When Carnarvon is present at the public opening of the tomb, he does it with such bravado, such excitement, such a devil may care attitude that Arthur Weigall, the reporter who's standing on the sidelines, says, "If he continues in this frame of mind, he will be lucky to last six weeks." This is really the seeding of the curse story from this very, very early point. Weigall's off the cuff remark would turn out to be prophetic. With the media frenzy interrupting the excavation's progress, Lord Carnarvon decided to sign an exclusive deal with "The Times" newspaper, appointing them as sole agent for all reporting inside the tomb. But, of course, it enraged all the other journalists. And it particularly enraged the Egyptian journalists from the Egyptian newspapers, because they could only learn what was happening in a tomb of one of their dead kings by reading about it in "The Times" of London. There's a huge media circus that, fundamentally, is kind of locked out of the event, so that every other newspaper sends along people to try and get as much information as they can, subvert the whole situation. Well, bud, good luck to you. Get back in 21 days or less. I'll do it. And they published stories from experts. And these experts weren't actual experts, because the experts were in the tomb. So the experts that they consulted were sort of fringe Egyptologist people, like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle or Marie Corelli or Rider Haggard. Of course, these people were interested in the elementals and the spirits in the occult versions of Egypt, rather than the actual practicalities of the dig. In February 1923, after the opening of the burial chamber, an exhausted Lord Carnarvon took some time out with his daughter Evelyn. So he rented a dahabiya and he decided to sail up towards Aswan, to sail on the Nile and have a few days of rest. Unfortunately, as he sailed, he was bitten by a mosquito on his left cheek. And instead of dabbing it with iodine, he nicked it with his razor when he was shaving and it became infected. Evelyn brought her father back to Luxor, where his condition worsened. So then, she took him up to Cairo, where there were better doctors. But I think he was stressed and exhausted. He got, probably, a form of septicemia. It probably went to his lungs. And then, sadly, he died on April the 6th, 1923. The moment he died, Cairo was plunged into darkness. And by some mischance, or not, the lights in Cairo did go out on that night. And actually, his dog Susie howled and died back here at the same time. So it is... I suppose, maybe I just think of it as a respect for the past. We don't know what happens after we die. It does seem to me so sad that Lord Carnarvon died in the hour of his triumph. He had made the most extraordinary discovery of all time. With Lord Carnarvon's sudden death, the press, excluded from the tomb, now had a story they could run wild with. "Dateline," Egypt. Visitors flock to the open tomb, attracted as much by the legendary curse as of the chance to step into a chamber of the far-distant past. Mystics the world over, led by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, cried out at the tomb's curse had claimed it's desecrator. It's difficult to imagine a more perfect storm, in the sense of the creation of a curse narrative than Lord Carnarvon's death in 1923, hot on the heels of, of course, the discovery of the tomb. And it fits a preconceived narrative of mystery, of danger, of threat. And it absolutely runs like wildfire through the popular press. It was in the Valley of the Tombs that Howard Carter and his expedition party first discover the tomb of King Tut. In the dead king's crypt was the inscription "Death shall come with swift wings to him who touches the tomb of a pharaoh." We also, as a culture, really like stories about bad luck befalling very rich people. We love it. That's what the whole of tabloid culture is about. Build people up and then destroy them. That kinda sense of revenge, of justice, of a kind of natural justice that is... That... that is hitting back. Curse stories are nearly always told by the poor, the oppressed about their masters. As Tutankhamun's body was removed from his burial chamber, the public, in increasing numbers, believe that Carnarvon had paid the price for disturbing the dead pharaoh. It was only when the body was discovered that it suddenly became very apparent that this was a young man. Particularly, being close to the First World War, it really sort of made people feel they could relate to him. People started to ask, was it actually right that Egyptologists should be digging up dead people, looking at their bodies, and so on. Should we not be letting these people rest in peace? After the War, the public's interest in spiritualism grew. So we have a group of letters, a one-sided correspondence, in fact. Because as far as we're aware, Carter never replied to these letters. But they were sent by a lady who adopted the name Stella Maris. And we believe that she was a renowned psychic, a spiritualist. Your Honor, we have met today. Many may wonder at the true purpose of this cooperation. In the time that is to come, life must cease. Spiritualism would've been very popular during this period following the... the First World War, where a lot of young men died. So parents, wives were very keen to reconnect with the recently departed. Stella writes "I believe that Lord Carnarvon owes his death to the fact that the tomb of Tutankhamun was opened without any ceremonies calculated to placate any or. "." And she says that to satisfy the spirits, which were guarding the tomb, that a... an offering of wine, oil, and milk should be poured on the threshold. And then, Carter and his team would be able to proceed without any further hindrance. Carter dismissed the curse as ridiculous and continued working inside the tomb while the press outside pursued it relentlessly. It would be a matter of weeks before Tutankhamun would claim his next victim. The discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb was soon eclipsed by the shadow of its alleged curse. The Pharaoh's victims were adding up. And the press seized upon the dark rumors. In May 1923, George Jay Gould, an American railroad magnate, died of pneumonia after visiting the tomb. July that same year, Egyptian playboy Prince Ali Fahmy Bey, after seeing the tomb, was later shot by his wife in the Savoy Hotel. Key members of Carter's team soon followed. It's well known that Howard Carter's account of the whole opening of the tomb was co-written by another Egyptologist, Arthur Mace. And within a year, Arthur Mace had had this major physical breakdown and had to retire from Egypt entirely. And he went back to New York and he died in 1928. The person who worked with Howard Carter to x-ray and photograph some of the artifacts was Archibald Reid. And he died in January 1924. And then, there was a French Egyptologist, very eminent, called Georges Benedite. And he had inspected the tomb and fell very badly outside on the steps and died in 1926. Others ensued. Lord Carnarvon's secretary was called Richard Bethell. And he died in mysterious circumstances in 1929, thought to have committed suicide in his London club. And the great confirmation of that story was that his father had heard this news and had kind of cried "It's the curse of the mummy, the curse of the mummy." And within a few weeks, his father had thrown himself out of a window and died as well. Within 10 years of the discovery, 13 deaths had been linked to the curse. But while the press lapped up such stories, others were skeptical. Some of those who died had never even visited Egypt. So it came to a point, almost, where anybody who had any connection at all with Tutankhamun or his tomb and then met a mysterious or unexpected end, it was attributed to the curse. American Egyptologist, Herbert Winlock, got fed up of hearing these stories. So he decided to do some research. And he looked at the people who'd been present in the tomb at various times. And basically, he worked out that of all those people who were there, the death rate was completely as expected. There was no disproportionate number of people dying. But if there is no curse, what of the tablet inscription reported to have been found inside the tomb? In the dead king's crypt was the inscription "Death shall come with swift wings to him who touches the tomb of the pharaoh." So the story that there was a tablet found within the tomb that said "Death comes on swift wings," I think we can put no credence to it whatsoever. In ancient Egypt, tomb warning were only found in private civilian tombs, not royal tombs. So Egyptian tombs, at least for private individuals, weren't hidden. They were very open and required visitors to come to them. The tomb wasn't just the place where you deposited a body and forgot about it. It was a place which actually served as the home for the spirit, the burial chamber. And then, there's the offering chapel. And that was very much where threats connected to tombs are situated. The idea is that if you behave badly in a tomb or toward the tomb, particularly the physical structure of the tomb, bad things will happen to you. Royal tombs were completely the opposite. The sort of threats that you would see in private tombs, you actually wouldn't get in a royal tomb. Tombs in the Valley of the Kings were not open to general visitors to come along and make offerings. And that's partly because the king is very different to everybody else. The curse inscription supposedly discovered inside Tutankhamun's tomb has never been found. It took 10 years for Howard Carter to remove Tutankhamun's funerary objects from the grave. The man most responsible for disturbing the pharaoh lived to the age of 64, before dying of natural causes. For a hundred years, stories of curses have been entwined with the public's love of Tutankhamun. And as his artifacts are returned to Egypt, they show no signs of fading. I think, fundamentally, people do love to have not everything explained to them, because it allows a little bit of interpretation. And it's that bit of interpretation that's the ghost story, that's the curse story. And as long as there is that space in the narrative, the curse will always exist, side-by-side with the rational explanation. And that will only continue to fuel our interest in ancient Egypt.
