Hey, watch it, man! Watch it! Get down. Hey! - What's the matter? - You're not gonna shoot me, are you? Oh, don't worry. I didn't... I didn't really shoot him. It's just a paint pellet. It's just a game. - Shit! - Gotcha. - I'm this close to gettin' away. - Right. - Are you out of your mind? - Oh, no, really, it's just... It's a bunch of us. We play. We hunt each other around campus. - You stained me, ya jerk! - What? - You just stained my sweater. - I'm sorry. Where? Would you get away from me, okay? Look, I-I'm sorry. I'll pay for the cleaning. How can I make it up to you? I'll take you to dinner tonight. I don't believe you. You run around here playing Cowboys and Indians. You smashed into me like a complete creep. You destroy my $60 sweater. And you've got the balls to ask me to go out with you? Yeah. You are without a doubt the biggest asshole... I have ever seen in my entire life. Does that mean no?

Who are you? Jonathan Moore. I'm in Professor Webster's class. - Oh, yeah, hi! - I was... Hi! I was just, uh, wondering if you were doing anything Saturday night. Uh, no, I don't think so. - Well, would you like to go out with me? - No. But you just said you weren't doing anything. Mm-hmm. You mean you'd rather do nothing than go out with me? Yeah. - Jonathan, wait up! - Hey, Manolo. You didn't wash the dishes this morning, again. I didn't? We're supposed to share housework, remember? Jesus, Manolo, are you my roommate or my mother? Hi, Manolo. - Who was that? - I don't know. You don't know? - I almost got nailed this morning. - By who? - Reilly. - Reilly? Reilly's a puss. He ambushed me outside of Haines Hall. I didn't even have my gun. So what did you do? Hid in a bush, and he walked right by me. You're a regular James Bond, man. Yeah, except James Bond had Pussy Galore. I can't even get a date. "Ordinarily, we don't"... We don't get this type of specimen in an undergraduate class, but... I wanted to give you something to remember over Spring Break. Now, when we have a sick cat like Tony here, He's gotta be tranquilized... in order to do the examination. Now, the name of the tranquilizer solution is... Sernylan, which I understand is very popular at your parties. - That's why we keep it locked up here. - She told me... she would rather sit at home and do nothing than go out with me. What's wrong with me, man? - You're too negative, man. - Negative? What's negative about, "Will you go out with me?" The way you say something is just as important as "what" you say. Now, this is where the tranquilizer gun... And darts... come into play. You gotta control the situation. You can't say, "Uh, will you go out with me? Huh? Please?" Like you've never gone out in your life. You just look 'em in the eye and you say, "What time should I pick ya up?" ...insert a dart... When we go to Paris, you gotta let those Frenchwomen know that you've got your act together. Always point the gun away from the head and towards the lower flank. Go ahead. Make my day. I don't know, Manolo, I think it's hopeless. I'm never gonna get laid! Although that thought may be of great comfort... to the women of the world, Mr. Moore, as a future veterinarian, you should know that... every dog eventually has his day. I mean, you just walk up to her and you say, "I would kill or die to make love to you"? No. Geez, no. You gotta have eye contact first. You look, she looks, then you say it. Don't say it like it's dirty. Say it from the heart. Then it ain't dirty, it's passion. You goin' back to the apartment? Nah, I gotta go to my folks' house. Your dad still givin' you a hard time about goin' to Europe? You kidding? He "loves" the idea. - It's out of the question. - Why? We've been through this a hundred times! Europe costs a fortune. Dad, I told you, I'm getting a special deal through school. - Jonathan. - Oh, thanks, Rosario. You're welcome, Jonathan. Look, it's part of my education. I mean, you want me to get an education, don't you? When school's in session, you get an education. When it's not in session, you get a job! - Mom... - Don't say "Mom." - Al... - Don't say "Al". He says "Mom," you say "Al," and the whole thing comes out of my pocket. You're gonna learn a hell of a lot more workin' in the real world... than you will chasin' skirts around Pomona. - Pamplona. - "Pamplona, Pomona"... I don't care if it's Cleveland. You're not goin' it's out of the question! Why does it have to be either/or with you two? You want to go to Europe, you want him to go to work. - Why can't you do both? - Fine. - Fine. - Fine? It's not fine. Why is it fine? Because it is. It'll give him a chance to pull up his grades next quarter. And just think. A week in "Paree" and he'll come back sounding just like, um... Marcel Marceau. - Fantastic. - Dad, can I borrow your camera? It's not a camera, it's a Nikon. And it's out of the question. - Mom? - Al. Everybody is speaking French. It's like a second language to these people. E-Excuse me. You are American "boys-eh"? - Yeah. - You want a taxi to Paris? No, thank you. It's too expensive. - We're gonna take the, uh, bus here. - No, no, no, no. I make special price for you because you are American "boys-eh." It's cheaper, faster, and much, much safer, hmm? Come with me. - Shall we go? - Why not? It's cheaper and faster... And much, much safer! - Jesus. - You boys are in a hurry? Hurry? No, it's okay, you can take your time. - Oh, man... - Bastard! Get out of my way! Where'd you learn how to drive? East L.A.? - Safer, huh? - Man, let me out of here. - How much do we owe you? - Uh, 400 francs. Four... Wh... I'm sorry, the... the meter says 200. Oh, yes. Two hundred for you, and two hundred for him. That's four hundred. - Thank you. - Wh-What's that for? Uh, "le service." The tip. Merci, au revoir. Service the tip? You can't want a tip for that ride! I think we just got ripped off, amigo. It's because we're American "boys-eh." This is the Champs-Elysee, man. Biggest shopping street in the world. The Arc de Triomphe's up there. This is Paris. Look at those Eiffel Towers. We're talkin' "eyeful"here. - What you doin'? - Excuse me, madam, I'd like to talk to you one minute. I want you to meet my friend. His name is Jonathan. Jonathan, this is madam. Voulez-vous couchez avec moi ce soir? - Quoi? - Voulez-vous couchez avec moi ce soir? Oh, you asshole. She likes you. What'd she do that for? I just asked her out for dinner. No, no, no. You asked her if she would like to go to bed with you tonight. - I did? - I thought you took French. I did take French. I mean, I can say "This is my pencil", "my pencil is big", that kind of stuff. Under the right circumstances, that could be useful. - Yeah? - Yeah. We gotta find those circumstances, Manolo. Thank you. This is all in French, man. I can't understand this. Ah, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. - Can you understand that? - Oui. Manolo, look at this place. It's incredible! It says here there are over 208,000 works of art. And that's like Roman, Ancient Greek, the Mona Lisa. - "Venus de Milo's here." - Yeah, you mean the chick with no arms? Yeah, that's the one. I mean, this is the palace where the French kings lived before Versailles. And then Napoleon turned it into the biggest museum in the world. What is your name? Heidi. I am Carlos, from Algeria. Have you heard of me? - Isn't there a terrorist named Carlos? - Shh! I need your help. I need you to walk with me to my hotel. I cannot walk the streets of Paris alone. - Will you help me? - I don't know... Shh! Say no more. I shall return. - What's goin' on? - I'm in! - You're in. - Her name is Heidi. Heidi? She's Swedish. We're goin' back to the hotel. Manolo, how'd you do that so quickly? Told her my name was Carlos, man, and I just got back from Algeria. She thinks I'm a terrorist. Swedish chicks go crazy for that shit. So, give me two hours before you head back to the hotel. Well, wait a second. Maybe she's got a girlfriend or something. Hey, no offense, but uh... I'm a terrorist. I can't be seen with somebody who looks like Bambi. I don't look like Bambi. Okay, so you don't look like Bambi. Why don't you go check out the Eiffel Tower? I already saw it. See it again. Come on, gimme a break! She's Swedish. Hey. Happy hunting, amigo. Monsieur? Uh, do you "parlez-vous" English? Un peu. Uh, "donnez-moi" "s'il vous plait," um, "Per-nodd." - Du grand vin? - Donnez-moi, "s'il vous plait"... I understand "donnez-moi," and "s'il vous plait." I don't know what is, "Per-nodd." "P-Per-nodd." Here. See. Ah, "Pair-noh." - "Pair-noh." - "Monsieur" wishes un Pernod. "Yes." Monsieur "does wish"... Do you take Travelers Cheques? - Pernod. - Merci. - "Avec de I'eau?" - Victor who? - With water? - Please! "Pair-noh". Geez. - "Per-nodd." - "Avec de I'eau!" Mon crayon est large. - Pardon? - Mon crayon est large, et bon crayon estjaune. Your pencil is big and yellow? - "Oui!" - Oh. Nice for you. What a jerk. Ahh! Ahh! What the hell. Excusez-moi, madame. I speak English. Yeah? So do I. - Yes? - Can I buy you a drink? Well, I'm drinking coffee. Drinking coffee. Yeah. - You know, you are very beautiful. - I know. Right, I just didn't want you to forget. Excusez-moi, monsieur. - I speak English. - May I sit with you? Yeah. Please. I was sitting over there, and... suddenly you looked like cute little boy to me.

Look, I got a passport here. It says I'm... I'm 18. Like, I can prove it. - I got... - It is not necessary to show papers. - Oh. - I believe you. Stupid, huh? You are a "weer-gin," yes? - "Weer-gin"? - A "weer-gin." You are not yet being with woman? - Virgin! - Yes. - Me? No. Geez. No, God, I... I've been with, you know, 30, 40, ya kinda lose track. Kinda. I like, um, "virgins." It is so exciting to me, to touch boy... the way no woman ever touch him before. It is a feeling of power. I gotta be honest with you. I am a "weer-gin." I... I, uh, I've been close a couple times, but I-I've never actually... Then, um... that is second lie, Jonathan. Do not let there be a third. I would kill or die to make love to you. - That's not a lie. - I know. - Hotel La Splendide, yes? - Uh, yes. Don't take it literally. I'll just, uh, check to see... Yeah?

How would you feel about goin' on to Spain without me? What do you mean? Sasha. She has to go to Berlin on business, and she really wants me to go with her. - Berlin? - Yeah. - You're kidding me. - No, what's wrong with Berlin? Nothin'. If you like machine guns and barbed wire. I thought you were all psyched on this Spain deal. Yeah, I was, "but, uh"... I just want to spend more time with her. I don't know, man. - I think you're losing your perspective. - Why? There are millions of girls in Spain. I know there are millions of girls there, but, uh, Sasha's special. She's special. They're all special. - I think I'm in love with her. - You're in love with her. I don't know if it's actually love, but... whatever it is, it's-it's the most incredible thing I've ever felt. Jonathan, you don't even know this girl. You're gonna do fine in Spain without me. I mean, You don't want Bambi hangin' around. I still think you're lettin' the little head do the thinkin' for the big head. But hey, man. Go for it. - You love this car? I love this car. - Oh, what is it? It's a... I haven't seen one like this.

We're going to East Berlin? - I tell you that, yes? - No, no, no, no. - You didn't tell me that. - Oh, yes. - Oh, no. - Mm. Well, I'm sorry, but... that is where my business is. Who has business in East Berlin? - What are you, a spy or something? - Yes, I am spy. No, I am like a messenger boy. - A courier. - A courier. - Well, what do you "couri"? - They do not tell me. - Who's "they"? - They do not tell me. I pick things up. I bring them across. I give to man. He pay me. I thought you were a graduate student. Yes, I am, but with this job, I make money to pay tuition.

We can even leave bags here. - I don't know. - You are afraid to go? No, I'm not "afraid" to go. It just seems kinda dangerous to... bring stuff across that you don't know what it is.

" Doesn't seem very "democratisch" to me. I mean, that guard at the checkpoint. What an asshole! Jonathan, these are not campus policemen here. You do not talk back to them. They are very suspicious of people from the West. - Especially couriers? - Especially couriers. - Danke. - Bitte. - Danke. - Bitte. So, when are you going to do your business? - 12:00 o'clock - 12:00 o'clock? - Then we're out of here? - Then we're "out of here." Then we're gonna go to Spain, right? - Maybe. - What do you mean, "maybe"? It's only fair. I came to East Berlin with you. You oughta come to Spain with me. I would love to go. I think you're a very... uh, amazing person. "I mean this"... "This last week"... Oh, it's been... It's been very special to me. Has been special for me too.

Money is no good here. You cannot pay, you cannot stay. - You're kidding. - I'm not kidding. - Come on. - What? I don't know what you're sayin'. - You American? - Yeah. Come on young fellow. See beautiful girls. - Stage show, live. Video. Movies - No, no thank you. For ten deutsche marks, you can see the most beautiful girls in the world. - Let go of me! - Homo! What? Come on. Move along. No sleeping on public benches. Jonathan? - Jonathan Moore? - You know me? I'm a friend of Sasha's. Where is she? She's supposed to be here. I'm afraid she's in trouble. What do you mean? What happened to her? Look, if she's in trouble, you'd better tell me about it. I think she will be all right, but you could help me make sure of it. - How? What can I do. - She gave you something in East Berlin. No, she didn't. You don't have to lie to me, Jonathan. I know she gave you something, and it's very important that you give it to me. Why should I trust you? Because I'm the only one who can help Sasha. - What is this? - Strudel. Strudel? What's wrong? What are you doing? What's wrong? What are you doing? Holy shit.

Welcome home. - Hi, Mom. - We're so glad you're back. - Oh, so am I. - But you look a little tired, dear. - I am a little. Hey, Johnny boy! Good to see you. You look great. How was the trip? Where's my camera? It's good to see you too, Dad. Oh, great. I thought for sure you lost it. Oh, Al. - You know he's only kidding. - Oh, God, this is great. Ohh. You wanna talk about this? Ah, Dad, I'm sorry. It was in my backpack when I jumped into the moat. - You jumped into a moat? - You jumped into a moat with my Nikon? Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I had to I... This is kind of a long story. - I've got all night. - Can I come in? - Sure. - 'Course, dear. Don't tell me, let me guess. This has to do with that girl, right? - Yeah, it does. - You knocked her up, didn't you? Oh, Jonathan! Leave it to you to find the one girl on the world who isn't on the pill. No, no, no. You guys are totally wrong. You didn't knock her up? - No. - You're flunking out of school? No, I'm not flunking out of school. What is it? Drugs? You're involved with drugs? No, Dad. I'm not involved with drugs. Please just listen. I told you about the girl I met in Paris, Sasha. Everything was going along okay. We were having a great time. - I'll bet. - Will you let him finish? Finish. Well she told me she was a courier and had to pick something up. - So we went to East Berlin. - "East" Berlin? - Oh, my God. - No. Everything was okay there too. Sasha made her pickup, and she gave me the strudel. Then this Russian guy started following her, so she called me and told me to meet her at the Cafe Friedrichstrasse, which really meant that I was supposed to get out of East Berlin. So I go to the checkpoint with the strudel, and I get strip-searched. - Oh! Strip-searched? - It's okay. I made it through. But then I go back to the hotel, and somebody'd stolen all my stuff out of the room, so I had to stay out all night. The next morning at the Citadel, Sasha wasn't there. This lady showed up, and she wanted the strudel. Why did the lady want the strudel? She didn't, but I didn't know that. So I gave it to her, and they shot her. - They shot her? - Who shot her? I don't know, but they almost got me too. That's why I jumped into the moat. Wait a minute. They shot her for a strudel? No, not for the strudel. For this. What's that? - It's a roll of film. - What's on it? - I don't know. - Why don't you get it developed? Dad, are you kidding? I can't just take this down to Fotomat. I mean it's got spy shit on it. "Spy shit"? Okay, he's on drugs. I am not on drugs Sweetheart, it's going to be all right. We have counseling programs for this. And whatever it costs, we don't care. You guys don't believe me, do you? This is not a game son. This is your life. You're right. I'm on drugs. I'm a junkie. You now, I mainline. I freebase. I put cocaine on my Corn Flakes. As a matter of fact, I gotta go meet my connection. Jonathan! You get back here. You had to let him go to Europe! - F.B.I. - Yeah, I wanna report a following. - I beg your pardon? - A following. I'm being followed by a Russian. - Oh, is this a joke? - No this is not a joke. Now listen. I smuggled a roll of film out of East Berlin. I still have it, and I want to get rid of it. This guy just chased me down Pico Boulevard. He's in a gray Mercedes. He's a K.G.B. Agent. - And you are a spy of some sort? - No I'm not a spy. Do I sound like a spy? Look I didn't know I was smuggling the film out. My girlfriend... She planted it on me. I'm sorry, sir, but the Bureau is precluded by law... from becoming involved in cases of foreign espionage. Listen! I have a roll of film that somebody was shot for, now what should I do? Perhaps the C.I.A. can help you. - Do you have the C.I.A.'s number? - It's in the book. I don't have a book. I'm in a phone booth. Then I suggest you call information. - Thank you. - You're welc... Good evening, Central Intelligence Agency. May I help you? Yeah, I need to come down there right away. What's your address? - Langley, Virginia. - No, no. I mean, in L.A. I'm sorry, sir. We cannot give out that information. - What? - We cannot give out our address, sir. I don't believe this. Look, is there at least somebody there I can talk to? One moment, please. Duty officer. Yeah, my name is Jonathan Moore. I'm not drunk, I'm not stoned and this isn't a crank call. Now, I gotta come down there right away, but your operator... She won't give me your address. What did you say your name was, again? - Jonathan Moore. - And what's your problem Jonathan? Put the phone down. Hurry! Let me see your hands. Step outside the booth. Over here. Put your hands behind your head. What's going on here? - Shut up. - That's him. I'll kill him! That son of a bitch tried to wreck my car! Relax Mr. Bronsky. We'll handle this. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say... can and will be used against you in a court of law. - Dad, you gotta listen to me. - No, you gotta listen. You know what you put your mother and me through tonight? I'm at a police station at four in the morning, and she... She's popping Valiums like they were m&m's. You know that guy Bronski? He's gonna sue you. No, he's gonna sue me. I'm responsible. You know what your insurance rates are gonna be? You know how much money this is gonna cost me? - I thought he was chasin' me. - He was chasing you. You ran him off the road. He wanted to kick your ass. I want to kick your ass! I thought he was a K.G.B. from Russia. - What? - I thought he was K.G.B. from Russia. He's a C.P.A. from Encino. What are you, crazy? - Yeah, maybe I am. - I know you're a good kid. I mean, just get yourself into a drug program, okay? Yeah. Okay. - What you got? - Nothin'. - Johnson? - Nothin'. Shit. Let's go. The kid must have it on him. Duty officer. Yeah this is Jonathan Moore. I talked to you last night, but we got cut off. - Yes. - Look, I really need your help. I got this roll of film from this girl in East Berlin. - I think it has spy stuff on it. - Uh-huh. And this morning, some guys they trashed my apartment looking for it. - Did they get it? - No, they didn't find it but... You should see this place. They went through everything. Jonathan - We believe you. - You do? Yes the agency is going to help you. Just stay where you are, and we'll send someone to get you. No, I can't do that. I don't know who anybody is. Anybody could come here and say that they're C.I.A. I gotta come to you. All right. Calm down. Our address is 444 Flower Street, suite 700. And do you have the film, or is it hidden somewhere? No, I have it. But there's something else. My girlfriend, her name's Sasha Banicek. She's in trouble. She's still in East Berlin. Don't worry about her. We'll take care of everything. You're bringing the film with you, right? Yeah, I'm on my way. All right. We'll see you. He's coming in. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Jonathan Moore. I'm supposed to see somebody. I'll be with you in a moment. Jonathan, dear, it's Mother. I got the number of the Brentwood Drug Rehabilitation Center. It's 555-4731. Please call them, darling. Remember: It's your life. This is Sasha. I'm at "Bonawenture"Hotel. Call me there as soon as you can. What the hell's goin' on in here? What happened? You're not gonna believe this. I mean, it's happening to me, and I don't believe it. I'm listening. After I left you in Paris, Sasha and I went to Berlin. - I know. - Yeah. Then we went to East Berlin. East Berlin? For what? For this. What they don't sell film in West Berlin? - We didn't buy it. We picked it up. - What's on it? I don know, It's got some spy information or something. Whatever it is, it's really important. - "Spy information"? - Sasha picked up the film. And she must've planted it on me, because I didn't know I had it until I got here. And these Russians have been following me from East Berlin... The Russians did this? - No, the C.I.A. did this. - The C.I.A. did this? Yeah. I think Sasha's one of 'em. I went down to the C.I.A. Office, and there she was sittin' in this room drinkin' coffee... with the same guys that trashed this place. I don't now, I hate to say it... but I knew something like this was gonna happen. - Hello? - Jonathan? Hi, Sasha. Jonathan, you are okay? I was so worried about you. You worried about me? Wh-Why would you be worried about me? - Did you get my message? - Yeah. And you will come to hotel? - No, I don't think so. - Jonathan I have to see you. Look Sasha, I don't know what kind of game you're playing, but we're gonna start using my rules. Hold on. You still a homeboy? You still a white boy? Yeah. You're in a gang, you're in a gang for life. You think the homeboys could do me a little favor? Yeah. There's a flower shop across the street from the Bonaventure. - Be there in an hour. - Jonathan, I... Hey, Sasha. If you wanna see Jonathan, go to Olvera Street, in front of the cross. - Olvera Street. - That's three blocks. Is your name Sasha? This is for you. Are you "Shasa"? Message for you. - English. - El Mercado. - Now who's this asshole? - Get in. Get in.

Be straight with him. Hi. Jonathan. You are okay? Look I know you're upset, but now I can explain everything. Upset? You think I'm upset? You drag me to East Berlin. A lady gets shot in my arms. I'm getting chased by people who kill people. My parents think I'm a junkie. And you're hanging out with the C.I.A. Why should I be upset? - Jonathan, you do not understand. - No shit. - Let me explain. - That's a good idea. Why don't you tell me what's goin' on? I tell you I was a courier. - That's a lie. - I am operative. A agent. For the C.I.A.? I'm very impressed. That's a good job. Jonathan, I did not mean for you to carry that film. That's lie number two. Don't let there be a third. No, I only wanted to use you for a cover. Why? Because I look stupid? No, be... Innocent. You look so innocent. - Goddamn it, I'm telling you the truth. - You don't know what truth is. Jonathan, I didn't want to use you. Wait a second. What... What just happened to your accent? Huh? Who the fuck are you? Is there anything about you that isn't phony? What's your name? What's your real name? Cheryl. Cheryl. Cheryl what? - Brewster. - Cheryl Brewster. From Prague? - Pittsburgh. - Pittsburgh. Cheryl Brewster. The spy from Pittsburgh. That's good. Oh, Jonathan. I didn't even know what was on the film until we got to East Berlin. Bullshit. They never used me for anything so important. They told me somebody was following me and... and I would never make it across the border. They told me I had to use you. I didn't have a choice. Everybody has a choice. You know, I thought we had something really good goin', I really thought you cared about me. I did. I do. Shit! - In here. - Where are we going? They're on my turf now. - What are you doing? - Tranquilizer gun. Come on. There's a phone at the bottom of the hill. Go call your friends. Gotcha. Aah! Gotcha. I'm at the bottom of the steps near the Student Union. So nice to see you again. Come on. Let's wait for your boyfriend. Did you call 'em? Jonathan, don't! Put the gun down or... or I shoot the girl. Put it down! Now, where's the film? - Thanks. - Gotcha. - Take it easy. - I got it. - Thank you. - The agency owes you one. Great. I'll let you know when I need my apartment redecorated. Hey. - Can I talk to you? - What for? This job's over. You can go on to the next one. Is that the way you think I feel? I don't know how you feel. All I know is I trusted you, and you set me up. I'm sorry. - Yeah. - No, I really am. There's nothing to be sorry about. I learned a lot from you. I should be grateful. - Grateful? - I don't want you to be grateful. What do you want? - Right now? - Yeah. You. You don't want me. I'm not your type. Not a "weer-gin". Not a little boy anymore.
