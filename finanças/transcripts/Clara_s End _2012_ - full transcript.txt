CLARA GOES TO DIE SWITZERLAND CHOSEND ASSOCIATION So you saw I got my first lung cancer 10 years ago. I was cured by a very tiring chemotherapy, and I swore to... Three weeks ago, I learned that my lung cancer recurred and metastasized in stage 4. So... I won't make it. The cancer is terminal. Chemo won't save me. I would gain only a few weeks... I decided not to get it. Listen, it's understandable. I want to decide. If I decided to prolong my life, I wouldn't recognize myself anymore. I'd be a burden to me and the others. No way. I want to die with dignity. Humanely. I understand. I will keep your medical reports to make sure it's truly hopeless. After then, but only when you decide to do it, we will set a date together, and set a protocol to follow. And then? You mean the day of self-relief? That's how you call it? Self-relief... Okay. You will go to your death apartment. One of my voluntary assistants will give you a portion of pentobarbital sodium which you will willingly drink. Of course, you can be accompanied by your relatives. Did you tell them about your choice? Yes, I will need to... How do others do? I mean... Does everyone tell their relatives? How are you, Mom? So how was your rehearsal? Did you nail it? Yougoff called. He's very upset at you. If you weren't at the rehearsal, where were you? What about you? The school called; you didn't go there either. Let's not start like last month. They'll expel you. What will you do then? Come on. You lie and reproach me for doing the same thing. The apple never falls far from the tree. Let's not fight. I really need to have a good meal tonight and watch a movie with you. What do you think? So what do we have in the fridge? So I propose that we have... Vadim? Vadim? Vadim, come back! Vadim, you're so ungrateful! Look, a ghost! I called everywhere yesterday. Your cell and home phone. I talked to your son several times. You didn't deign to call me back. You knew that it was a very important rehearsal, and that it was Tim's last day. - I couldn't talk to you. - Yeah? Why? You were voiceless, you lost your tongue? I left a message. My mom was sick; I accompanied her to the hospital. Elena was also worried when she saw the message. She wondered what had happened to her mother, and in which hospital you were. Your mother was in perfect shape. Our conversation was quite revealing. "My oldest daughter "has a very complicated relationship with truth." That's it. You think I'm a fool? Get ready. Jose. You and I will talk later. Come. - A discreet place? - No, I'd suffocate in a booth. You and your twisted lies. You forget I have the same mother. I can worry too. What got into you? You're so screwed up these days. It's dad's cancer, Elena. I will die. You relapsed? No, it's lung cancer. Stage four. So I am fucked up. I've decided to end my life. There's a clinic for that in Switzerland; that's where I was yesterday. I didn't want to kill myself alone. I cannot do that to Vadim. I can't leave him with that powerful despair, that relentless sorrow. So I chose this assisted suicide method. Will it be easier for him? Will it be more acceptable, less traumatizing? The doctors told me that I got only two months left. Two months? Since when have you known about your cancer? For three weeks. You told me nothing. Because I didn't want your fucking sympathy and pity and to be looked at as someone who's going to die. I thought I'd be strong when faced with the fear of my own death. In fact, I can't. I... I am afraid all alone. I am even terrified. I am here. I feel like... meat rotten on the inside and raw on the outside. I don't know how I am going to handle it. - Keep it between us. - I promise. Don't look so dejected. I'll die, not you. I already told you not to pity me. But what about the play? I will do the premiere and die in Switzerland next day. Can you do it? Except bloody your fingernails again and get caught? I know nothing else than this. But, this, at least, I can do what we can. I'm sorry, but... - These words are absurd. - What do you mean? You could even say them in real life. We are running full-speed into a brick wall. Wake up! I spit on your happiness! I spit on your idea of life, that life that must go on, come what may. You are all like dogs that lick everything they smell. You with your promise of a humdrum happiness, provided a person doesn't ask much of life. I want everything! I will not be moderate. I will not be satisfied with what you offer if I promise to be good. I want to be sure of everything. It was perfect. Vadim, what's going on? Hurry up. You couldn't hear your alarm clock? You promised you wouldn't skip classes. Get up. It's not closed yet, right? We close at 8:30 like every morning. I am sorry, you cannot close yet. My son is here, and so is she. We are barely a few minutes late. What is that in a life? - That's the rules. - You'll open this gate right away. You must have been late a lot to have such a job now. - What's wrong with you? - Let me do it. Where are you going? Your rehearsal is not going well? It is. Why do you ask? I don't know... You look a bit weird. Rehearsals in the beginning are always a bit stressful. Listen... I want us to talk about your future. About your studies. You don't need studies to become an actor. - An actor? - Yes. - Are you serious? - Yes. But you are not interested in plays or famous literature? I will be in movies. I will go to a friend's house for my vacation. Her mother will be there; she will call you about the food money. During this upcoming vacation? - The one in two weeks? - Yes. I hoped we could spend some time together. Some time? To do what? We are always together. I am bored with you. I prefer my friends. I have fun with them. Mom. I am not four years old anymore. The time is gone when I was your little puppy and I had to obey you all the time. Her mother will be there! Stop manipulating me all the time. Can't you see it doesn't work anymore? Apart from harping on school and my messed-up future... "Oh, how sinister!" Can't you see you are out of the game? Go have fun with people of your own age like Yougoff. Stop relying on me! I don't need you anymore. Hey, Vadim. I don't stop you from seeing your friends. The day starts and ends without Titus ever being able to see Berenice, without my being able to see Titus the entire day. Vadim, my love. It's the small things that I learned through my life which I record here. I wish my voice could always stay with you. Having known you... It was such an upheaval for me. You cannot expect it. I didn't think I would have a child, but then you arrived. You were a little boy. Small like a little shrimp. But you did well. You did with me what no man ever managed to do with me. What are you doing there? I'm here to see you. I heard. - What? - I won't go. She's going to pay for this. Listen, I have plenty of things to do. I am here. We are here. - Did you drink? - Yes, a little. When I heard the news, I was so devastated. My little sister. I am very moved, but you have to let me breathe. I don't agree at all about the way you want to end your life. It doesn't matter. I'm not asking you. I think you are making a huge mistake. You didn't think about the consequences. I think you are being a coward. You don't belong to a family of cowards. We stick together. - Coward? - What is this sordid death? You think it's a play? This isn't Shakespeare. Swallowing poison in a mundane small room in Switzerland? That's the story you want to leave behind you? Stop! Don't lecture me. I don't need your preaching. Don't drink my whiskey. Let go of that glass. People don't commit suicide. They don't give up. It's absolutely insane! Human body is still an enigma, even for science. Science has no idea about your strength and your faith in life. I am not a churchgoer, but I am Catholic. I know; no, I imagine. I imagine there's perhaps something, you can't know anyway, above us. Stop. Don't pollute my head with your newfound religious knick-knack. I've never been a believer. I don't care about what's there. If there were, He wouldn't let me die so young; I wasn't so bad. You must understand that for the family, for your relatives, your son... You want me to die before the sacrosanct family and you, coughing out my lungs full of blood and bellowing with pain? Remember Dad? - He fought until the end. - Yes. I saw what the end looked like. I was there too. Do you know what it taught me? Courage and willpower. The example you leave behind. Nonsense. He was like an animal. He roared like an animal being butchered. In the end, even during his moments of respite, he wasn't with us. He was at the limit, terrified by his suffering. How can you talk about dad like that? Dad left the image of a man who fought until the end. I don't give a damn about images. My boxes are full of images and pictures. It taught me that dying was degrading. It's inhumane! Why do you think I took this job? It's because life is ugly! If you don't struggle to dream, we've got nothing! Zilch! But now, I have no means to cope with what I have. I feel completely naked. I'm quivering in this body which is expiring and rotting; and people look at this stinking body which is going away! It's humiliating for a woman like me! Stop! I already suffocated in this shitty family with you and dad as an abusive father. I won't die in your dirty hands. I have always thought you were crazy. You are crazy! Since psychoanalysis, we know why women become crazy in families. Women are crazy because families are. - I don't know what you mean. - Then leave me in peace. I don't need you to bite the dust. I am your older brother! I'll fight until the end to make you come to your senses. Dad's agony didn't help you in harsh times? Answer me! Dad didn't help you? Would you have wanted a coward as a father? Dad... He desired me physically. I went all the way with him. What are you talking about? No, you don't know everything about life. You're talking nonsense! I heard nothing. Anyway, you are crazy. You are crazy and drunk. You're an actress, a very imaginative woman. I'll ask you one thing. Only one. If your son were in your shoes, would you let him do this crap? If it were my kids, I would force them to stay until the end. Fuck off! You are nothing to me now! I'm sure people will hear about it. - Get the fuck out of my house! - Yes, I am going. I'll be back. I asked you to shut up, Elena! How could you do this! I am sorry. I just simply told him that you were not doing fine, then he made me talk; you know how he is! That unbearable pain of others when one is sick! - I am sorry. - Did you tell your husband too? - No! - Shut the fuck up! It's my last wish! How come you are wearing this? - Clara. - Jean. - Why does Thérèse have my dress? - It's my fault. Lilia asked me to wear it for alteration. What do you think? We don't even know when you come. It doesn't suit you at all. Not your size. You look so bony in this. You were there. She should take this dress off right away. Let's go. Darling, our investors want to know how things are going and want to have dinner with us. It flatters them. It could be worse: she could yell because I'm still on the stage. Toast! Congratulations for your nomination. We are very proud that you represent France in Hollywood. Thank you. How is the rehearsal going? Good. Very good. We are very happy. Clara is... Delighted. Great. There are already some articles in the press. We feel the play is expected. There's real curiosity. If the play is successful... - Still, there is a risk. - True. Anyway, we'd like to think about touring abroad. Los Angeles, London, Berlin... Why not? Amazing. For sure. Excuse me. Are you okay? I was looking for you. You are so pale. I'm okay but I feel lonely. - We are all lonely. - Why do I feel so lonely? Why did we lose each other? You didn't want me anymore. You treated me like a doll, a vase, a party date. Why was I born all alone? I didn't have enough love. I didn't have enough. Is it you? You never come at this time. How are you, Mom? My body aches, like always. Vadim is not here? He never calls. He's a teenager. He doesn't call me either. Your brother's kids call me. You didn't raise him well, without a father. You want to do everything on your own. It's not good. I'll shut up. If you don't want me to talk, don't come to see me. Soon, I won't be here. You will kick yourself. Mom, I will be the first one to go. Yes, right. Mom. It's dad's cancer. I am finished. No. Yes. I am telling you. Just like your father. Your father, father... Stop showing off. I'm in pain. I hate being old and seeing old people all the time. You would want to be my age and want to be me. - No. - See? You are disturbing me. You are boring me. I am disturbed. I have an appointment with my hairdresser, and I made a mistake. My massage therapist is going to arrive and I won't be here. I will cancel it for you if you give me the number. What did you do recently? I prepared my departure. No, listen. Talk about something else. The next on the list is me. That's the order of things. What do you want me to talk about then? An interesting exhibition, your work... Some entertainment. I visited the Monet exhibition in the Grand Palais. I saw a piece which threw me down yesterday. What did it represent? A small landscape in cloudy weather, with a bell tower and a brook. Monet painted it when he was sick in bed. There is a decrepit tree in... It's dark. - I'm high. - It's good, right? - There's no more tobacco inside. - Shit. Where did you say the Nutella was? I'll steal a cigarette from my mother. I know her stash. Sorry. I'm so hungry. This is nice. I would have wanted to remain the love of your life. And I wanted to tell you... What is it? It's huge. It's my mother's. She records herself for her rehearsals. Are you serious? Be free. Aim high because life often gives much less than what you hoped. - Much less than what you hoped. - Aim high! You must gamble. There is much to lose. Love to death, but don't die from it. Yes. I'm dying! No, don't die! Life without love is dry and sterile. Dry and sterile. The secret is inspiration. Your mom is killing me. Stand up as high as you can. - As high as you can. - Let's rise up, then. We're standing up. Climbing! I have to move. It was fun. - Bye. - See you. Your mother is something. I have six weeks left to live next to you, before dying. You are the person I care about the most in the world, my Vadim. As a result, I am torn apart. I know you know how much I love you. But until my last breath, I want to ignore it so that I can say it again to you. I have six weeks left to live next to you, before dying. Hello, my kitty. Vadim? Is that bullshit true? You'll kill yourself? Yes. - My cancer is back. - I know. I wanted to call you but you wouldn't answer. So I called Elena. She explained everything. That's how I learn about your disease and death! - By voice recordings! - No. I wanted to tell you. I was about to tell you. The recordings are for after I die. It's to tell you essential things. But I am your son, shit! How can you think I cannot help you? That I cannot bring you anything? You're so sure there is only you! I wanted to spare you as long as possible. I want you to be next to me when it's time. No. I don't want to see you dead. You really want to die? I am going to be alone? All alone without you? I can't even imagine. In one month. What is this shit? What is this fucking injustice! You must decide what you are going to do with your life. Before I go, we must talk about it. Anyway, I am screwed. I don't grudge you, but I'm screwed. No, I am screwed. It's not you. I don't want you to think in a pessimistic and elusive way anymore. You cannot allow it to yourself anymore. You must improve about that, sweetie. Before I... How is it going to happen on the day of your death? Are you okay? Do you want to sit? I will get you a chair if you want. I'm okay. Yann came to see me. He wants to make up with you. He says you shouldn't grow apart. Grow apart? I am dying. Tell him that. I don't want to; we never got on well with each other. It's your brother. You cannot exclude him. You can't die upset. Don't leave like that. He told me that you talked about dad in a funny way. I didn't tell anything. Nothing you need to know anyway. I don't want to talk about it. Period. Dying is like that too. You take secrets with you. Clara? What are you doing? I need you. We talked about it three times. I'm fed up with it. He saved some people. Why not you? What do you have to lose? Isn't your half-sister half crazy? Crazy? She's an accountant. She saw the letters of cancer victims on walls. What's the subject? A man I want your mom to meet. We are so lost. He takes appointments between 6 and 8:30. Then he takes care of his cows. Is it a joke? I've never done this before. Shit! What is all this? We are not alone. I told you so! Where are you going? We're cutting the line. They'll shout at us. Pull back. They are from all over. You should know about fame. I hate being known by everyone. Mom. Hi. It feels good. We have no tent. - Cheers. - Cheers to you too. I'll be back. I'll go for a walk. Thank you, sweetie. I got stung! Shit! A car. The cops. In this shithole. With all the things we drank and smoked, we are in trouble. - Stop, I can't even pee. - And I peed on myself. Is everything fine? Yes, thank you. Could you please leave us? Go away! We are not rabbits. She's our cousin. I hope we can find her. We've been looking for her for ten days. That's why you've come to see the magnetizer. I'm going to hit the sack. Me too. - Courage. - Thanks. You too. See you. How are you, Mom? - You don't sleep? - I will have plenty of time later. What are you doing? Are you thinking about things? No, I'm just doing nothing. It's new to me, you know. You can ask me. If you agree, let's have a big cleaning. We'll get rid of all our misunderstandings. All the emotions that blocked us in our relationship. There shouldn't be regrets or dissatisfaction when I leave. We'll both do it. What emotions? Everything that went wrong between us. All the things that hurt you. I don't want to go leaving bitterness, suffering, or even dissatisfaction in you because of my selfishness. It's important so that our relationship can end well. We have much more than a relationship. You are part of my life. You are my life. I am your flesh and blood. Your only son. You talked about your selfishness? You said it. You weren't always there for me. I've felt it since I was a kid. I don't really matter to you. You prefer your theater, going-outs, the people you work with, the men you love... When you were in love, I didn't exist anymore. I am there but you put me in the background; I hinder you. You don't know what to do with me anymore. You've left me in fucking solitude. - It's not true. - Yes. It's true. You wanted us to talk. We're talking. But you know, Mom? I love you. You are the person I love the most in the world. Hello. I came because... I have lung cancer. Stage four. I'm thinking about suicide. It's nice of you, Gerard. Hello, Miss. I am so happy. I caught a cold, but it's better now. - They are... - Working, yes. We'll have to suffer! To feel the pain come back. It is so acute; it cannot be endured anymore. It should stop, and yet it should continue. It keeps on increasing, like a high-pitched voice. No, I can't. Put more emotions in the text, Elena. Your character has no choice. She is cornered. With their stupid expressions. They will take us with their 1000 arms, their 1000 faces, their only expression. They will spit on our faces. We will have to be on a moving cart, surrounded by their hatred. Very good, Elena. Again. Clara. Jose. - Am I bothering you? - No. I came to tell you that I am so honored to perform with you. I'm fortunate to be able to look at you. I'm learning a lot. I find you amazing. Thank you. This isn't embarrassing? No. Thank you. Quite the contrary, it pleases me. Thank you. I also like a lot what you do with your character. Come back whenever you want, Jose. Your Spanish way of admiring actresses is charming. How beautiful your monologue was! You took me for a ride. I was blown away. It was my first time to see you fragile, nervous. With incredible expressiveness and a completely unique way of moving your body. You must be more audacious. You must be less meticulous. Take advantage of the rehearsals to fail. You talk as if I were a beginner. I've long accepted I'll never convince you. I don't have your talent and I don't care. You have experience and very pretty things in you; it's true your acting never captivated me. But now I don't know. I've opened my eyes, and I see you. Can do better. No, will do better. I'll help you. Since I saw that magnetizer, I feel as if life is all around the place. All I need is to stoop to pick it up. - What is it? - It's nothing, Honey. It's... Really, I'm okay. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm okay. Go to the kitchen. I'll meet you there. It's getting worse. Hemoptysis is a sign. It's when you spit blood. We have to make other tests: another CT scan. No. I'm going to live. I don't care about your CT scan. I don't want your tests. I feel better. That's what matters. If you do it and the results are good, it'll give you hope. What if they are worse? Stop your bullshit. Stop concealing the truth to yourself. Listen. You need a treatment which can really relieve you. Yes. But I don't want to be dumb with medication. Science isn't everything, don't you agree? There's the life force too. There is also the energy a human being can use. And what is a body? Our flesh is animated by our mental force. But the influence of the body on the mind exists too. Unfortunately, in practice, it's often our bodies which dictate our limits. Do you want to turn your back on medicine for sure? It's your choice. Let's go. I want to live with you when I'm dead, not somewhere else. Of course. I will be there. SWITZERLAND CHOSEND ASSOCIATION It will be on May 26. The day after the premiere. So... May 26. 26... It's Thursday. 26 is a good date. Very good. Perfect. About the apartment, I don't like it. I need to die before a beautiful landscape. I found a chalet in the mountain. I don't know whether you could... Yes. Certainly. If you pay the chalet's rent, we can do it in the most beautiful way you want. My color's changed? So I am in progress right now. After then, I will end up in the archives. Listen. You can still change your mind. Until the last moment. You have to sign the contract now if you don't mind. The toaster is broken. How am I going to make foie gras? I can fix it. Can't you see it's dead? Everything's broken, just like me. I don't believe this. I didn't invite him. Why the hell is he here? Look at him; he's hiding behind mom. Some people would even ruin your death. He's our brother. He belongs here. Please, Clara. He promised he wouldn't make a fuss. You still believe him? Come on. Let's go meet them. Your mother looks nervous. Of course. Wouldn't you be in her place? She'll drink a glass of poison in front of you, and that's it? Adieu, I die. Bye bye! I die. She's bluffing. She'll never do it. Vadim, time to eat! Everyone, time to eat! Let's go down. Better not make her wait on a day like this. Let's start! - Give me your glasses. - It's a special bottle. Be quiet, please? I am very happy to see you all here. I... The reason I have gathered you here today is because I have set the date of my death. So take out your schedule books. Those who have one. It will be on May 26. I thought about the 27th, but I remembered it's your birthday, Dimitri. I cannot do that on your birthday. So it'll be on the 26th, the day after the premiere. Severine, I believe you'll be back from your weekend in Venice with your new lover. Eddy won't yet be studying for baccalaureate. You, uncle Henri, I believe you leave for your thalassotherapy on June 3rd. - No appointment that day, Mom? - You are annoying. It will take place in Switzerland. As you know, you can't do such things in France. So I took train tickets for you, which I will distribute. Mom. Elena. The chalet is very big, so for those who want to stay next day if the weather is nice, it will be perfect. Emile. And the place is wonderful. Henri. No matter what, I want to stick my tongue out at sadness and regret. 43 years is a life. I had a beautiful life. A life... A life... A passionate life. Beautiful. Beautiful and rich. Intense. That's why I leave in peace. And I've accepted that it's over. Everything ends in this world. My life is reaching its end. I'd like this even to be, how can I put it? Natural. Take this. Vadim. I won't experience suffering and pain. You fall asleep. You have a drink among your relatives, memories, and love stories. Only those who remain will need courage. How do you want us to do? Do you want us to be around you all the time? No. Nothing. Don't change anything. My door is open, and I'll be alive until the 26th. Don't change anything. This is Adele's ticket. And me? I am not part of the chosen ones? Listen, I'd rather not. It will be my last day, and as we say, the last wish of a dying man is sacred. I'd rather not. You don't want to go for a last trip to see things? Egypt? We can organize all that. We can even go with you. It's kind of you, Honey, but... I don't have such desires anymore. Go play, kids. I looked into it. Euthanasia in Switzerland costs 6,000 euros. Pentobarbital sodium costs 20 euros. - Really? - Switzerland has a monopoly. If that's not making a killing... Honey, please calm down. No. Clara, I can't. To me, it's the same as suicide. What mother would accept it from her child? Have you thought about your son? If he told you the same thing, I... I am reaching the end of my life, I have three adult children, and because of you, I feel this is a total waste. You're not asking for our opinions at all. You force your death on us as an organized trip without taking into account our feelings and our pain. You're almost being sadistic with your relatives. We also have to experience this terrible thing. Mom, I support Clara in her choice. I understand her. All you can is follow your sister. Clara. As long as you're alive, preserve your life. Mom, you saw what happened to dad. You saw how much he suffered. - For nothing! - No. That's not going to work. Your father stayed until the end. His last six months were very difficult, but they were essential for him and me. I told him all I had to say to him; I believe he heard me. I accompanied him the best I could, with all my love. I am sure he felt it deeply. With you, there will be none of this... None of this extremely important human encounter. You're depriving us of the last moments. Not at all. Quite the contrary, I'm offering you to do it here, right now. Love me right now. Clara! She's so selfish! She doesn't care about her son. If it had been my mother! No way I'm going to see her body in Switzerland. Listen to me! Don't talk about my mother like that! - Vadim. - Calm down. What's your problem? Are you crazy? Stop! Stop that! You're insane! Stop! Let go of me! Mom. Hug me. Aren't you a little bit old? No. Do it better. Apply yourself. Please. Why didn't you ever do it for me? Did I ever tell you how much I missed it? Your eyes scared me. You had the cold eyes of my mom, which judged me. What? No. No. You were wrong. Not me. No. - Sweetie, it's for you. - No. Yes, I mean it. It's my pleasure. It will have a second life at your place. You're embarrassing them. They don't know how to behave. It seems morbid to them to get them now. Not at all. What are you talking about? Here, Emile. A little gift for you. Vadim is not doing okay. I talked to him. He needs to see something else. Can I invite him home tonight? His cousins will help him take his mind off it. What do you mean? He will have plenty of time for that later. - He asked you that? - Yes. He says he no longer knows how he feels. This foretold death even though you are standing alive before him makes him feel as if his chest is going to explode. I don't want to stay alone. I will be here. I'll stay with you. No, I need him. I need Vadim. I cannot accept his leaving in my last moments; he's going to feel guilty afterwards. Go. Quickly. Please take care of your cousin? - I promise you. - Thank you. I don't want to be away from him. I don't want to be away from him! I don't want to! - Hi. - Hi, beautiful. And you did it. You'll have me killed without wanting it. My fingernails are broken, full of dust, my arms are covered with the welts left by the paws of your guards. My guts are wrenched by fear. - But I am queen! - What are you doing with my lines? You see, I am working. I like this text very much. - It inspires me. - Are you imitating me? You were doing the gesture I found earlier? - It's not what you think. - Really? What is it then? This play represents many things for many people. I understand what makes you want to hang on until the premiere, but the play must go on after you. At last, you show your true colors. As a great tragedian you want to die and leave everything in ruins in your wake? There are 11 of us. Everything will suddenly stop for us. You always talk about others, not yourself and your frustration. So... If you allow me, I'd like to take over the role. Lea knows the part very well. I'd like to draw inspiration from your work. I'd like you to exist through me. If you told Yougoff, I'll kill you. No. Don't worry. I didn't even say anything to Lea. It was just an idea. That's all. Insurance companies will never want you. No one will ever give you a lead part. It's grotesque. I know everything about stage direction. I have my legitimacy. I have been an actress for as long as you. I'm not begging. You are also less talented and have less stature. Why do you think you're in this play? I asked Yougoff, otherwise no one would have hired you. Elena, are you naive or stupid? Fuck. At last, I will be able to live. You are going to disappear. And your death will free me. So yes! Good riddance! Neither save or force me. Conceited girl. You can only make me die. What if I had you tortured? What's going on? - Clara! - Call the doctor right away. Elena. I am here. The doctor's here. I don't need a doctor. I want to see you. Me? Why didn't you tell me before? You pushed me away. It hurts. Do I matter so little to you? That's not it. You wouldn't have kept me for the rehearsals. Listen. I want to do the premiere. I want it to happen. Don't tell anyone. I don't want people to come see my last performance. I don't want people to come see me suffering on the scene. Anyway, it's fucked up. The play is dead. Don't mix things up. I'm going to die. I know you. As soon as you are out of here, you will think about another actress for the rehearsals so that she can be ready the day after the premiere. Come. If you choose her, I want to meet her. I want to be sure that she keeps the secret. That's my last wish. You can't even promise me that? SWITZERLAND CHOSEND ASSOCIATION Everything will be fine. - I will wait for you outside. - Come. Come, you must come. Hello, Miss. - You must be Vadim? - Yes. The time is drawing near. The three of us know that. How do you feel, young man? Very good, obviously. I feel trapped. I have to have a reaction which everyone expects. I don't know, maybe sorrow or despair. But I... I feel blocked. I'm like a statue. You shouldn't remain petrified before what will happen, before your mother's choice. To the contrary, you must force yourself to react to create words and emotions. Whatever you do, whatever you manage to share with your mother, it will bear fruits. When the moment comes, it will soften the blow. I can't believe Cotebelle will replace me. The premiere will be strange. Don't judge my performance too harshly. Do we have a deal? It makes me happy to die on the stage like Molière. Done. I'll go. - Shit. - Bye. I will go back to my seat. I don't want to have to run. Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. There are many VIPs. Cotebelle has just arrived. I woke up so early this morning that the garden was still asleep. Have you ever thought how lovely a garden is when it is not yet thinking of men? The night, it was the night. I woke up first this morning. You'll have to suffer! To feel the pain come back. You are insane. We cannot. - Why not? - He would have us die. Of course, each has a role. He must have us die, and we have to go bury our brother. That's how things were distributed. What do you want us to do? I don't want to die. I also wish I wouldn't have to die. We will have other nights together. Maybe not. Other fights, too. Hug me! Tighter than you ever hugged me. May all your strength be imprinted in me. It feels so good. I don't want to see their faces or hear their voices. You will see me dead. It's enough. Guards, to the door. We'll evacuate the palace. Stay here with her. So it's you? Who me? The last man's face I see. So it seems. Let me look at you. Don't make a fuss. How are they going to make me die? I don't know. I think I heard they were going to wall you in. Alive? Yes, at first. Come. No, don't chase him away! Let me be with him more! More! I want to stay with him! Let him be with me. I want to stay with him. Come! No. I tried everything. You could have lived and loved my son. You chose madness and death. I cannot do anything for you anymore. It's too late. I am sorry. What do you want? You see, I came. I have courage. I will now go with you. No. Leave me alone. I can't live if you die. You chose life, and I chose death. Go away. I've had enough of your jeremiads. I don't even know why I die anymore. You would have had a good time without me. I am afraid. My tombstone. My wedding bed. For my underground dwelling. All alone. They are in a frenzy! Go. Bravo everyone! Congratulations! Please come in. Make yourself at home. Isn't it great? It's beautiful. Shit, I chose mountains, but we can't see them. It's also beautiful with clouds. It's Chinese. You chose very well. Are you okay? I am afraid. I feel I'm going to be put to death. You can still renounce. No, it's too late. They are waiting for me. Okay. I will explain how it will take place. But before anything, I want to know if you are sure of your decision. Absolutely sure. These are two pills which will unlock your digestive track. Let them melt under your tongue. Now you have 30 minutes to be with your relatives. I will wait for you in the big room. As soon as we are in a quiet place, you'll take the portion; I will ask you to lie down on the bed quickly, for the effect is quite fast. Eight minutes at tops. Okay. I'm not going to wet myself? No. Don't worry. You'll remain clean and beautiful. Can I see the bottle? Of course, just one moment. Do you want a little bit of my pie? Here. Trust us. It's... It never fails. It's strange. It smells nothing. It's almost odorless. It smells a little bit like orange blossom. I've never loved saying goodbye. You always have to have a head start, my son. Well... Farewell. I feel I've never really talked to you. I guess it always feels this way at a time like this. We can't see each other. We know nothing. We let time go by. Then it's over. I loved you very passionately. You will be in my heart and I in yours. May I leave? Are you letting me go? Yes, you can die, Mom. I love you. I love you too, my love. You know. You are the most beautiful person in my life. I love you, Mom. SUBTITLES: RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
