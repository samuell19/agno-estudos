What. What? Ugh. Oh. Oh, greetings from Tromaville. And welcome to the lovingly recruited digitally... uh, who gives a fuck? This is a DVD about a movie. Troma mov... "Getting Lucky." "Getting Lucky." It's a Troma DVD. Nobody's going to... you're never going to get in any stores. Nobody... economically blacklisted. I'm depressed. I've never gotten lucky. You know, it's going to be directed by somebody. Getting lucky. Get lucky. You know that, Michael Tilson Thomas. I don't know. Paul Michael Thomas. Fuck, l ain't got no luck. And l never had any... Paul Michael Thomas. Paul Gerard Thomas. What the fuck? That's what the Troma movie is probably... this guy probably did some other movies, like what do you call, "Body Parts" or "Witchcraft," or something with Julie Strain, that kind of thing. I'Il tell you... I don't give a fuck. And you're going to have a commentary track. You know that. This was a movie probably made... it was probably on USA Up All Night. I'm depressed. I am fucking depressed. I ain't never had no luck about anything. Help. - Help. - What? Help. Hey. There's a little man in here. There's a little man in my beer. What? I'm a leprechaun. Oh, you're a leprechaun? Ah. I have to grant someone three wishes. I get granted one wish? Three wishes. Well, l wish... oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that... l'm sorry. I didn't swallow you, though. You're OK. I don't swallow. You know that. These lips have never swallowed, no matter how many times l've given... used my lips like a woman. All right, leprechaun. OK. Fuck. I want to wish. I wish... l want to get lucky. I want to get lucky. You fucking little shit leprechaun. That is not... that's not getting lucky. It's awful. I don't want this shit. Goddammit. You know what l want. You know what l want. I'm not Jesus Christ. I'm a leprechaun. Give me another wish. You give me another fucking little shit wish. All right. I'Il take another wish. I want to get lucky. OK. Leprechaun, you really... even though you got all them sores on you leprechaun ass, you're pretty cool. Wow. I'm getting lucky. I'm going to get lucky. I'm so lucky. Get ready to watch the lovingly recreated, digitally remastered director cut DVD of "Getting Lucky." Let's watch. You're coming home with me later, baby. You're hot. I hope no one sees this because people don't know l'm a homo. Hey, you're not wearing green and it's St. Patrick's Day. Sorry, l forgot. Bye, Mom. Bill? What's all that trash piled up on your bike? I'm recycling. You're going to get pinched. At the rate l'm going, l'Il have enough money saved up for college by the time l'm 990 years old. Maybe by then l'Il be eligible for the Methuselah Scholarship. Dude, l saw an afterschool job on the bulletin board in the gym. Really? Go on, move in close. Tighter. Tighter. Shove it in there. I said shove it in there. Dude, check out the new foreign exchange student from France. Is that the stuff wet dreams are made of, or what? You know who l really like? Krissi Shackler. I've had a crush on her ever since the seventh grade. All right, you muscle heads. Let's hit the shower. We don't want to blow our wad before the big game. Hey, Krissi. I heard you finally broke up with Brian McCulloch. Boy, word sure gets around fast. We just broke up after fifth period today. Well, how about you and me getting together sometime? Sure. When? Behind the gym in five minutes. No, don't tell me. Tony wants you to meet him behind the gym. How did you know? I should know. I have been behind the gym with Tony Chanuka quite many times. You're not the only one. Yeah. We've been getting to know the back of the gym pretty well. Mm-hmm. Don't do it, Krissi. Tony just use you and he throw you away. Yeah, like a paper cup. But he's such a hunk. Hey, here's that thermos l thought I lost a couple of weeks ago. Tony, if you'd clean out your locker once in a while, you'd probably be very amazed at what you'd find in there, you know? Oh, man. The milk's still in it. Oh, put a lid on that thing, Chanuka. Yeah, they got laws against gas warfare. OK, listen up, you guys. This is Bill Higgins, the new Buckskins towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Go easy on him, you knuckleheads. I'm getting tired of having to get a new one every week. Hey, towel boy. Why don't you come here and pick this towel up, man? Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Ow. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. No, no, no, no. Use your teeth. I think my hand would be much more effective. Ooh. Yeah? Well, l bet l got something your hand would be pretty effective on. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. Hey, towel boy. Get down here and clean up this mess. Tony, man. Where are you going? The fun is just getting started. Hey, Jeff. When the female elk is rutting, the male elk must head the call. Hey, you saw that National Geographic special too, huh? Hey. I was just on the verge of starting to get mad. What's there to get mad about? I mean, the sun is shining. The birds are singing. You and me are here together. The only thing that could be any better is if you and me were naked right now. I thought you were going to stand me up. Hey, it would take a real dodo brain to stand up a babe as hot-looking as you. Oh, Tony. You know how to say just the right things. Scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub. Tony, wait. What? There's something you should know about me. What? Have you got herpes or something? No. I'm a virgin. Yeah, sure. No. That's what they all say. But l am. Really. You mean to tell me that whole time you went out with Brian McCulloch, he never boned you once? No, he tried lots of times, but l never let him. Well, why'd you break up? Because l found out he went out and boned Patricia Abernathy behind my back. Creep. Hey, l know a perfect way to get back at him. How? Do it with me. Scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub. Tony. What? Did you bring a condom? Yeah. I wasn't a boy scout for three years for nothing. You're like a sweet Georgia peach. Tony. You feel so firm. Wait, Tony. I changed my mind. Come on. You know you want it. Tony. Scrub, scrub, scrub. Towel boy. Towel boy. Towel boy. It's going to be like a wave crashing down over your entire body. Tony. Don't. The most awesome wave you ever felt in your entire life. Hey, towel boy. I'm going to kill you for this. It was an accident. I swear. My uniform's ruined. Hey, dude. How's the new job? I quit. Dude. How are you ever going to cough up the bread for med school? I'Il find something. Dude, l thought you were hanging up the recycling thing. It makes me sick when l see how people throw trash around like this. Think of all the trees we cut down to make this junk. In 50 years, all the rainforests are going to be gone. And that's where most of our oxygen comes from. Yeah. What are we going to breathe then? Styrofoam? Dude, l'd really like to help you out with the oxygen supply. But if l'm not home in time for dinner, my mom's going to kill me. Later. Yeah, later. Hi, honey. Can you wash this for me for tonight's game? God, this smells terrible. What have you been doing? Some stupid nerd threw puke water on me and Tony. This is Tony, by the way. - Oh, hi, Tony. - Hi. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Shackler. Aren't you on the basketball team? He's the team captain, Mom. That's a very lovely hairstyle you have there, Mrs. Shackler. Thank you. I have some homework to do, Mom. Uh, have a nice day, Mrs. Shackler. Yeah. You, too. I thought we were supposed to be studying biology. The best way to learn something is with hands-on experience. Tony, my mom's home. OK. We'Il keep the moaning and groaning to a minimum. Why do you have to be so crude? Because girls like it that way. Don't you? Just like animals do in the woods. Tony, did you bring a condom? I already got it on. What's going on in here? Oh, Mrs. Shackler. Hey, am l glad you're here. Um, Krissi fainted and I was trying to give her artificial respiration. We were just about to study, Mom. Oh, yeah. I bet you were. Uh, that's a very lovely hairstyle you have there, Mrs. Shackler. Young man, l want you out of his house right now. And l don't ever want to catch you with my daughter again. Help. No, please. Don't throw me away. I'm only 1,257 and 1/2 years old. I'm too young to die. Hello. Oh, hey, baby. Hi, Tony. Sorry about what my mom did this afternoon. Oh, look. Don't worry about it. Hey, why don't you meet me under the bleachers tonight after the game? Tony, l don't want it to be like that. I want you to take me on a real date, you know? I mean, not under the bleachers where stale popcorn and gum wrappers are sticking to my rear end. Like, take me to a movie and bring me candy and flowers or something. How am l supposed to do all that? Your mom won't even let me get within 10 feet of you. I know. What are we going to do? Lepkey Graniola Chavcheski's the name, but you can call me Lepkey for short. How'd you end up in a beer bottle, Lepkey? It's my punishment for being a drunk lad. There's no such thing as a Betty Ford clinic for leprechauns. I have to grant someone three wishes before the spirits of the goblins will let me out of here. Three wishes, huh? Hey, l'Il volunteer for that. On one condition, lad. That you don't show me to anyone. The last thing a recovery alcoholic leprechaun needs is a bunch of noisy scientists picking around his innards. Or worse, be made to appear on "Geraldo." OK, Lepkey. It's a deal. I promise, l won't show you to anyone. Hey, look, Krissi. I got an idea. It's brilliant. You know that new towel boy, the squirrelly little twerp who threw water on us today? Here's what you do. Go ahead, lad. Make a wish. Gosh. This is better than winning the lottery. Really? OK. I wish that every country on earth would throw away their bombs and their guns and... and start working together to end hunger and... and start cleaning up the environment. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold your horses, lad. I'm not Jesus Christ. I'm a leprechaun. And a mighty rusty one at that. But you said l could wish for anything. I know. I know. Couldn't you start off with something a little less ambitious? You know, maybe a new pair of cuff links. An ant farm. Something. I know. Oh, Lepkey. I wish for a date with Krissi Shackler. Oh, now that sort of thing is more up me alley. All right, here we go. Exeter, flexeter, fee, fi, fo flacker. Give a date with the lass, Krissi Shackler. Oh, l wish it could just be that easy, Lepkey. Bill. Telephone. Oh, who is it, Tim? No. It's a girl. Hello? Krissi Shackler? Well, yeah, l know who you are. I just didn't think you knew who l was. Really? You mean you and me? Tonight? Yeah, hold on. Dad. Can l borrow the car tonight? I don't know, son. You know how the roads aren't very safe after dark. Come on, Dad. Please. Oh, let him take the car, Leonard. All right. OK. Go ahead. Take the car. Yeah. OK, right after the game. I'Il pick you up, Krissi. OK, bye. Number 31 has the ball. He's dribbling. He's dribbling. That boy's a natural born dribbler. It looks like we have a timeout. There seems to be some sort of obstruction down the court. The referee is examining it now. It's hard to see what it is from here. It looks like some kind of candy wrapper. Wait. It looks like... Oh, gosh. I don't believe it. It is. It's a condom wrapper. Oh, this is disgusting. It appears that one of the basketball players was carrying a prophylactic in his sock. You think he'Il be penalized? It's hard to say. It seems the players are arguing over who the mystery condom belongs to. It's good to know these boys are practicing safe sex. I guess practice makes perfect. Yeah, it sure does. All right. We're back in action here. In the final 15 seconds of the regional high school basketball championships. The Goleda Nomads leading the Middlevale Buckskins 96 to 94. The clock is running. The Nomads have the ball. They're dribbling. They're dribbling. They're dribbling. Wait. Wait. Chanuka has the ball for the Buckskins. He's dribbling down court. Less than 10 seconds remaining. The Nomads in hot pursuit. Chanuka crossing center court. 6 seconds remaining. Chanuka for the Skins. Do l look all right, Lepkey? You look fine, lad. Fine. Very fresh. I mean, you don't think I overdressed, do you? No. No, it's perfect. Trust me, perfect. Here goes nothing. No, don't say nothing. Lad, confidence. Go in there, lad. Show her who's boss. Sweep her off her feet. Boy, l sure am nervous. Phew. You may have put on a little bit too much cologne there, lad. Try not to asphyxiate the poor lass. I'Il try not to. Good. Now, just go in there. Wish me luck, Lepkey. Good luck, lad. You're going to need it. There he is, Mom. Hi, Bill. Bill, this is my mom. Mom, this is Bill. Hi, Mrs. Shackler. Nice to meet you. So, uh, where are you planning on taking Krissi tonight? Uh, to the drive-in. No, you are not taking her to the drive-in. I know the sort of thing that goes on there. How about miniature golf. OK, miniature golf's fine. But l want you to have her home by 11:30. And no hanky-panky, young man. Do you understand me? Oh, yes, ma'am. No. But Krissi, we told your mom we were going to go play miniature golf. This means we'Il have to lie to her. It's OK. I have to lie to her all the time. Krissi, think of what the world would be like if no one ever told any lies. If everybody just told the truth all the time. Think of what a world that would be. Could you get me some popcorn? Lots of butter? Yeah, lots. This way. The safe house is this way. No, she'Il find me there. I know it. I have to escape. We must go to the portal. After her. Don't let that little bitch escape. After her. Go, my queen. I will set the controls. But where are you sending me? Somewhere far. Even if they figure it out, they won't be able to find you. Went to the bathroom. Be right back. Krissi. My daughters. Bring me my daughters. Rucchio? You're here? But how have you been allowed to leave? OK. So what do you think? It's better than the bleachers, isn't it? Uh, we got the movies. And remember those flowers you asked for. Here you go. Tony, that's so sweet. Babe. I also got some candy. And last but not least. Condoms. Wow, you think of everything. Oh, let me show you the way, baby. You want it, don't you? Oh, you want it. Don't you? I'm going to show you just how it's done. Let me have you. Damn, what the hell was that? Tony. You know you want it. Come on. Open your mouth, Dawn, and l'Il cut your tongue out. But he's not just any man. He's our father. Here it comes. But mother wanted him here. Mother is basketcase. Oh. Mm-hmm. Tony, what's wrong? No wonder. I was rolling it on the wrong way. Shit. I'Il just try another one. Oh, man. I dropped the stupid thing on the floor. Just get another one. You have two dozen. Lepkey, something's gone wrong here. I mean, l know girls take a long time in the bathroom. But she's been gone for over an hour. Ay, lad. I'd say there's something rotten in the state of Denmark. Tony, what time is it? Oh, man. How can you think about time at a time like this? I have to be home by 11:30. OK. It's only 10 o'clock. Really? It seems a lot later than that. Tony, just get another one. Damn, l know it's here somewhere. Wait. Ah, there it is. Shit. How did it get so dirty? Well, if you vacuumed your car out every once in a while. See? I told you it was a good thing l stocked up. I'Il just get another one. Krissi? Shut up, you little son of a bitch. Krissi? Shut up, you asshole. Krissi! Fucking mother fucking son of a bitch. I'm going to track down your little bitch of a sister and kill her. Damn. What's wrong now? I went soft again. Tony, this is beginning to be more trouble than it's worth. Krissi? Is that you in there? Her name's Susie, butt face. Sorry. What are you doing? Sh. Tony, what are you doing? We're going to make the little soldier stand at attention. Krissi. Mother fucking son of a bitch. Krissi. Shut the... Oh, baby. That's the ticket. That's it. Is that enough? No, no, no, no. Oh. Just a little bit more. Yeah. That's it. That's it. Krissi. Hey, beat it, towel boy. Can't you see we're busy? Krissi, it's almost 11:30. Tony, you liar. Think about yourself. What? You can't leave yet. Wait. You can't leave now. And towel boy, l'm going to get you for this. So what are you going to do after graduation? Why do you want to know? I was just thinking we could get to know each other better. Everybody has dreams, things they want to do in life. Thanks for getting me home in time. What do you mean it doesn't count as a wish? You went out with her, didn't you? The whole thing was a setup. She just used me so she can meet some guy her mom won't let her go out with. It's rustier than l thought. Maybe you should wish for something a wee bit more tangible. Like l said, romance isn't one of me specialties these days. How about a car? A car. That's the spirit, laddie. What kind of car would you like? Make it a Ferrari. And what color would you like your Ferrari, lad? Red. Would you like any air conditioning, stereo, mad wheels? Oh, come off it, Lepkey. Wishes like that don't just come true. My date with Krissi tonight proves it. Exeter, flexeter, night sky so starry. Make there appear a bright red Ferrari. Take a gander out your window, lad. Oh my gosh. I don't believe it. Wait a second. This isn't a... this isn't a Ferrari. This is a Pinto. OK, OK. So l need to work on my chops a little. But at least l got the color right. Wow. The keys are in it and everything. Thanks, Lepkey. This is really incredible. Does it qualify as a good deed, lad? Oh, you bet! One down, two to go. Hey, towel boy. I'm not a towel boy anymore. Hey, look, you little pissant. That's twice now you've kept me from getting laid. But l had to get her home. Ow, ow, ow. Lepkey. Are you all right? Ay, lad. Bill, would you like me to teach this belligerent son of a biscuit to a lesson he soon won't pry loose from his one-track mind? It's not violent, is it? Eh, it may be a tad violent. You talking to yourself over here, towel boy? No. What'd Krissi have to say about me last time when you were taken her home? Nothing. Oh. Well, look. I want you to take her out again night. And l want you to bring her over to my house. No. What did you say to me, towel boy? I won't. I refuse. You're cruising for a serious bruising, towel boy. Look, you seriously don't care about her as a human being. All she is to you is a living a blow-up doll. If you don't do what l'm telling you, towel boy, l'm going to ram this tennis racquet so far up your ass, you're going to look like a human shish kabob. I've had enough of this. Exeter flexeter, fee, fi, fo, flacket. Give him a taste of his own tennis racquet. What the... ow. Ow, ow. Lepkey, you know l'm opposed to violence of any kind. But in this case, l'Il make an exception. Ooh. Ooh. Oh, man. Hi, Tim. What's up? Dude, what's Tony Chanuka doing? I don't know. Must be some new martial arts deal. Cool. Later. Yeah, later. Ow, ow, ooh. Ooh. Ow. Bill, l know you must really hate me for what I did to you last night. And you have every right, but l just wanted to tell you l'm sorry. I did a lot of thinking after you took me home about what you said about people being honest with each other. And it makes a lot of sense. It was really awful what l did to you, using you like that. Because you're a really nice person. And l really like being with you a lot. And l would like to go out with you again some time, only for real if you still want to go out with me. I would invite you in, but my mom's not home. That's OK. But l would like to see you again sometime, if that's OK with you? Yeah. That's more than OK. - That's great. - Great. You give me a ride to school? Yeah. Well. Well what? Well, aren't you going to kiss me goodnight? Uh, sorry. See you tomorrow? Yeah. Goodnight. Goodnight. Fuck you, towel boy. Fuck you. I hope Krissi's going to be all right. I mean, she's all alone in her house and Tony Chanuka's lurking around outside. And believe me, he has a serious personality problem. I don't mean to rain on your St. Patrick's parade, lad. But perhaps the two of them had a previous engagement. There's a lot more to the story than the fair maiden waiting chastely in her castle for her knight in shining armor to return. I really wish l could know what's going on in there. Sometimes, l wish l could just be a cat. Exeter, flexeter, boom diddy, dat. Change my friend Bill into a puddy tat. Gosh, Lepkey. You sure are getting good at these wishes. The petals are spread wide as pollen is swept into the awaiting stamen of a nearby flower. Thus, the mating process of these plants is complete. However, in the animal kingdom, things are not quite as simple. On the moist tropical savannas of Eastern Africa, these two spotted giraffes prepare for some deep throat in the hot Serengeti. Here, two African wildebeest copulate furiously in the sun, while a hungry pack of jackals watch from behind a nearby rock doing what jackals do best... jacking off. I hope she doesn't recognize me. Oh, boy. National Geographic. These two young gorillas quibble over the rights to stuff a freshly plucked banana. Despite a valiant intent, this South African deer can not reach its own genitalia. I wonder if this is what my sex education teacher meant by heavy petting? This manly rhino practices forbidden water sports deep in the darkest regions of the lower Congo. Maybe l should be a cat more often. Oh, no. I hope that's not Tony Chanuka. do practice this form of water erotica on a regular basis. Safe for a few limber Himalayan yogis, most humans find this practice slightly out of reach. Tony. What are you doing here? Hey. Is that any way to talk to a guy who just got out of the hospital. Yeah. I heard about the tennis racquet. What'd you do, fall on it? I saw a little twerp leaving when I pulled up a few minutes ago. What was he doing here? He took me to play miniature golf after school. Miniature golf? Yeah. I had fun. And don't call him "twerp." His name is Bill, and l happen to like him a lot. You tell him, Krissi. What has he got, a big schlong or something? No, he treats me with respect. Respect? What kind of bullshit is that? Something you obviously don't know anything about. Look, Krissi. I'm... l'm sorry l came onto you so quick, OK? It's just that you're such a hot-looking babe. And you turn me on so much that l lose control of myself. You know, l mean, you don't know how much you turn me on. Hey, when l was in the hospital this afternoon, the whole time they were pulling the tennis racquet out, all l could think about was you. Don't listen to him, Krissi. He's only interested in one thing. Tony. Come on, baby. Let's just cut through the crap and go over to my house. My parents are out of town for the next three days. No. No, Tony. I like Bill now. As a matter of fact, l like him so much, if he asked me to go steady with him, l'm going to. What? You'd take that bozo over me? Yeah. Now, get out of my house. You weren't invited and you never will be. Nobody talks to Tony Chanuka that way. Tony, leave. Just... Tony don't. Hey, you want to play hard to get, bitch? - Huh? - Just leave. That's how you like it. You Neanderthal. Tony. Stop. Oh, this is the way you like it, isn't it, baby? Stop it! Tony, stop. You're just like a little doe, strutting through the forest... Tony, get off of me. Just stop. Waiving her little white tail off. Stop it, you big galoot. Tony, get off of me. Yeah. He chases her through the forest. Yeah. Then he pins your little deer ass down in a cope of moss. Tony. Stop. Bangs you like there's no tomorrow. Tony, stop. I better do something. Tony. What the hell. Ah. I thought l told you never to come back here. He tried to rape me. Oh, that's it. I'm calling the police. You should have seen me, Lepkey. I was just like Errol Flynn. I bet you were, lad. I'Il bet you were. Now, all we need is one more wish and we can send me little green butt back to Ireland. Oh, Lepkey. This car you gave me is a lemon. Picky, picky, picky. Hi. Hi. Where's your car? It wouldn't start. You like riding bikes, don't you? Yeah. And l like cars better. Besides, my seat's too high on my bike. Oh. Well, l can fix that for you. Oh, good. I'Il be right back. OK. Oh, shoot. The bolt on her bike is old inches standard and my tool's metric. Is your wrench too small, lad? No. Actually, it's just a little bit too big. How about if l made the wrench just a wee bit smaller? Sure, Lepkey. Go ahead, make my day. Exeter flexeter, me, mi, mo, meenier. Make the little wrench just a wee little bit teenier. Lepkey, what'd you do? Oh, no. I think l overdid it a bit. Hurry up. Get us back to normal size before... Bill. Krissi. I'm down here on the bicycle sheet. Where'd you go, Bill? She can't hear me. If we don't leave now, we're going to be late for school. Hurry up, Lepkey. I can't remember the bloody chant. Try anything. I'm leaving. Make something up. It doesn't work like that. Hurry, Lepkey, before... He didn't even adjust my seat. Guys. No, Krissi. Don't sit down. Just can't count on them. No, don't! Bye, Bill. No! Good morning, class. Today in our continuing study of the settling of the American Southwest, we'Il focus our attention on the first exploration of the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon was the last unexplored region in the North American continent. In fact, maps prior to 1870 merely labeled this Northwest corner of Arizona as the... as the unknown territory. It wasn't until the year 1869 that the first exploration of this unknown territory was undertaken. It was a journey fraught with peril. Maybe if we can climb to the top of Krissi's skirt, we can get over onto the desk. And then when first period ends, you can make us big again. Ay, ay, captain. They took a boat stocked with provisions down the treacherous waters of the Colorado River. Are you all right, Krissi? Yeah, Mr. Peterson. Sorry. These intrepid men had no idea what they would encounter behind every curve in the canyon walls. Indian legend of the time tells of the river dipping underground, culminating in a great subterranean waterfall that cascaded straight down into the bowels of hell. Uh, Krissi. Is there something you would like to share with the rest of the class? No, sorry. I don't know what came over me. Now look what you got me into, Lepkey. Sorry, lad. If l ever find another leprechaun in a bottle, he's going straight to the recycling bin. Some of Major Powell's men did not... Krissi. If you need to go to see the nurse, please feel free to do so. No. No, l'm all right. It went away. Some of Major Powell's men did not survive the arduous trip. Lepkey, isn't there anything you could do for us? I think l remember the way to make us bigger. Oh, god. Not now. Don't make us bigger now. These brave men in the boat had a lot on their minds. The churning river that lapped against the sides of the boat, tossing and turning them. The towering precipices that loomed high above their head. And the raging river that whipped them into a frooth. Uh, class. Class. Tonight, please be sure to read the chapter on Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn. Whoa. Oh. Oh, no. Oh, no. Ah. Oh, Ah. Oh. No. Ah. I just found out they canceled the exhibition game. Why? Why? Tony Chanuka's in jail. You're kidding. What for? I don't know. Has anyone seen Bill today? Final call for... You mean towel boy Bill? Don't say that. I think he's so cute. Well, he might as well be a towel boy. He's in the doghouse with me. Come on. Help. Lepkey. Help Lepkey the Leprechaun, I'm going down the drain. Help. Help me. Grab the bar of soap. Whoa. We're heading for the drain. Do something. Here goes nothing. Ah. So what were you planning on doing with this? Nothing. Nothing? OK. It's a lucky charm. Huh? Really. You were drinking, weren't you? I don't drink alcohol. It destroys your brain cells. Don't you lie. Ow. Ow. Exeter, flexeter, me, my, mo, miney. Change course the rod that is striking Bill's hiney. Mr. Wheeler, are you OK? God, l better go get the school nurse. Lepkey, you know l'm opposed to violence of any kind. Krissi. Sit down, Bill. We need to talk. I can't sit down. I just got back from the principal's office. Good. You deserve it. Krissi, listen. What happened today in the girl's shower was an accident. Yeah, right. You stood me up for school this morning and made me late. I guess that was an accident too? It was. And the little joke with your glasses and the wrench? Bill, you're so immature. I think we should stop seeing each other. No, Krissi. We can't. Ow. I love you. I've been in love with you ever since the first time l saw you. I went to all the football and basketball games ever since junior high. And l don't even like football and basketball, but l went to see you. Krissi, these last two days have been the happiest days of my life. Please, give me another chance. I don't think so, Bill. Oh, Bill. I am so sorry about getting you into all that trouble today. I wouldn't have screamed like that. It's just you frightened me. When l turn around, l see a boy standing there. I wouldn't have screamed if l knew it was you, Bill. So if there is anything l can do for you, Bill, anything, you just let me know. Babette, Bill and l are having a very private conversation. Oh, so sorry. Excuse-moi. I really mean it, Bill. If there's anything l can do, you just let me know. Thanks, Babette. Bill, l think it's time we made a commitment. I think we should go steady. Krissi, l was going to ask you that same very thing today, but things got all messed up. Look, l got you this. Where'd you get this, a gumball machine? I'm on a very limited budget. It's OK. It's the thought that counts. If this kid turns out to be a dope pusher like you say he is, I'Il put in a good word for you over in the DA's office. Yeah, maybe he'Il reduce the, uh, attempted rape charge to something more chickenshit, like, uh, indecent exposure. Oh, man. That would be great. What makes you think this kid is a dealer? I've seen him walking around talking to empty beer bottles. I mean, anybody does that kind of stuff has got to be on drugs, right? OK. He just bought a brand new car. I mean, it was just a Pinto, but... but still. Where's an unemployed towel boy going to come up with that kind of cash? It doesn't grow on trees, you know? He said he won it in the Irish sweepstakes. Thank you, Mrs. Higgins. That's all we need to know. Oh, get out of here, you confounded canine, fire hydrant leg-lifting lawn defiler. Princess, that's no way to treat our guest. If that dog doesn't leave me alone, I'm going to turn him into a pumpkin. You better not. I'm just kidding. Lepkey, l think I've finally come up with an idea for a third wish. Thank goodness. I can't wait to get back to Ireland and get out of this blasted beer bottle. Well, l figure car insurance, gas, and maintenance for the Pinto for the next 5 years is somewhere around $50,000. Then, college tuition for 4 years plus med school is somewhere in the $90,000 range. Plus, cost of living expenses. Figure another $50,000. And then if you add 5% a year for inflation and 3% a year for cost of living increases, it comes to a total of $298,265.42. That wouldn't be a problem, would it? Problem? It's no problem at all, lad. Oh, Lepkey. This is great. Who is it? Bill? Yeah, l'Il be right there, Mom. Bill. Bill, would you please open your door? Just a second, Mom. Are you doing something in there you're not supposed to? No, no, no. I'm coming, Mom. I'm on my way. Bill, open this door right now. Would you please open your door, Bill? I'm undressed. I got to get dressed. Oh, darn. Where's my underwear? Just a second, Mom. Stop play games, Bill, and open this door. Mom, what'd you do with my underwear? I can't find it. I'Il be right there. I'Il just grab, like a towel or something. Oh, Mom. I got no clean towels either. Be right there, Mom. Open this door right now. OK. Here l come, Mom. You're not looking at dirty magazines again, are you, Bill? What dirty magazines, Mom? You know, the ones under your bed with half the pages stuck together? Oh, Mom. I threw those out months ago. I took them to the recycling center. OK. A couple of people were by today asking about your car. Oh, yeah. I got to get that registered. I'm going to get that taken care of first thing tomorrow. Do you need to borrow some money from your father? No. Actually, Mom. I think l'Il be all right. I think l got it covered. I went with Jeffrey Minnoti in the 10th grade. He got his hand under my shirt twice. Uh, Brian McCulloch felt me up a total of 14 times. 3 of those times he actually got his hand underneath my bra, but 2 of those don't count because he was being really sneaky about it. And when l realized what he was doing, l pulled his hand away. I had seven hickeys. The first Richard Catheter gave me in the ninth grade at Jamie Windler's party on the neck. And my mom saw it. And... Wait a second. What'd you do, go through your diary with a pocket calculator? I just think it's important that we know each other's sexual history. Oh. Well, l don't have much of a sexual history to tell. Other than an occasional "Playboy" magazine here and there. That means you've never even touched a girl... you know? It depends on how you look at it. Stop beating around the bush, Bill. Who is she? Babette Detoi? No. You've been seeing her behind my back, haven't you? - No. - Just admit it. Krissi. Look, the only contact I've ever had with Babette was that day in the girl's shower. - And you were there. - Right. You snuck in so you could see her naked. You voyager. It's pronounced voyeur. See? She's teaching you all those French words, too. Krissi. Krissi, look it. The farthest l've ever been with a girl was with you. That means you haven't even been to first base yet. Well, maybe l've just been waiting for the right pitch. Bill. Oh, sorry. I got a little carried away. Well, it's not that I don't want to. I've been reading Brooke Shields' autobiography and l think she's right about staying a virgin until your wedding night. I'm going to boycott all of her movies and books for life. Bill. I'm just kidding. No, really. I think it's a smart idea. The stars sure are pretty tonight. Yeah, they are. Not half as pretty as you. Krissi? Will you... Will l what? What? Will you marry me? Yeah. Yes. I'm really going to miss you, Lepkey. And l you, lad. Just remember, the minute you stop believing in magic, that's when your life starts turning into a big pile of horse puckey. Thanks. I'Il try to remember that. Bye, Lepkey. Hey, ready for graduation, Tim? Yeah. As ready as l'Il ever be. Come on, let's go check out these limbs. OK. Dude, l finally got up the nerve to ask Babette out. And she said yes. I'm happy for you, Tim. Dude, it looks like you just sat through a three-day Blues Festival. Well, l finally got up the nerve to ask Krissi to marry me. She said yes. Her mom said no way. Mom, you were only 17 when you got married. Only because l had to, Krissi. I don't want you making the same mistake l did. Is that what l am? A mistake? Oh, honey. I didn't... that's not what l mean. I... it's just... you two have no idea of the problems that can come up in a marriage. I mean, l should know. I've been divorced three times. I love him, Mom. It takes more than love, Krissi. Well, if it's money you're worried about, I've saved up enough to get through med school. Yeah. And l'm going to nursing school. See, Mom, before Bill, l didn't have any real direction in life except to be a cheerleader. Now l do. You're going to be a doctor? Yeah. And after we raise a family, we decided we want to open up a clinic somewhere. Somewhere where they really need one. Somewhere besides Beverly Hills. Right. I mean, l know it's impossible for one person, or even two people, to heal the whole world. But if each of us could just heal a little tiny part of it, think of what a world that would be. Be careful. Be good! Goodbye! So where's your Pinto? Oh, it finally died. But my dad gave me this as a wedding present. Oh, that was nice. But, uh, maybe we could get, like a paint job or something. Krissi, for you the world. Sure a paint job. This is the happiest day of my life. Yeah? Not for long, baby. Tony. How'd you get out of jail? They reduced the charges to indecent exposure. Where's justice? Get over, buddy. Bill. Yeah. You're out of here, towel boy. Bill. Excuse me, sir. Do you have an extra horse l can borrow? Well, l have two feet, so l need both of these. But l have a horse. Uh. Horse. No, Tony. Tony. Go get him. Go get who? The fucking asshole. He'Il never catch them. Let's go. Bill. Bill! Hey, asshole. Give us back our shish kabob. Yeah, give them back their shish kabob. You're ruining their whole picnic. Ah, fuck them. Oh, be careful, Bill. May l? Whatever. Thank you. Just like the animals do it. The two bucks fighting it out while the rutting female looks on. She can't help but get all wet, watching us do battle. She gets all hot knowing that she has to fuck the winner. Survival of the fittest. Passing on the better genes. The call of nature. The survival of the fittest. Oh, no. Shit. Ah. Ow. Ow. Ow. Sorry about your dinner. Bill, my hero. Bill, how are we ever going to get these handcuffs off? Don't worry, we'Il find a way. With a nail file? Bill, this is going to take forever. I've got forever if you do. Vice squad Freeze. Freeze. Drop the nail file. What the hell's going on here? We're on our honeymoon. Seems like one hell of a honeymoon to me. Nubbs, search the place. What are they looking for, Bill? We've had your kinky lover boy here under surveillance for the past six weeks. Surveillance? What for? International drug smuggling. What? Cut the innocent act, Higgins. What was in that package you sent to Ireland last month? Ireland? Listen, doll face. We tried to track it, but it got lost in the mail. What was in the package, Bill? You wouldn't understand, Krissi. What about that promise that we made each other about being totally honest? I know. But in this case, the truth is so far out there, no one would believe me, even if l was totally honest. Try us. Yeah, try us. OK. I was on my way home from school and l found this leprechaun in a beer bottle. He was put in there by some goblin, so he could sober up because they don't have Betty Ford clinics for leprechauns, you know? In order to prove that he was sober, he had to grant three wishes. Because if a leprechaun's drunk, he can't do magic right. So he granted my three wishes, even though he... you know, flopped up some of the things l had asked for. But... but still, we had a deal. So after he granted my third wish, I mailed him back to Ireland. You know, Nubbs. We may not be able to prove this kid's been selling drugs, but we sure as hell can prove he's been taking them. Hey, Faukett. Look what l found. They're both under 21. Let's book them. But it's non-alcoholic. See? He's got us on that one. I'm beginning to think this Chanuka character has been giving us the dry ream all along. You don't know where we can find your friend Tony, do you? Last we saw him, he was over at the state park coping a buzz. Come on, Faukett. Let's go check it out. You guys wouldn't happen to have a spare handcuff key, would you? Thanks. I love you, Krissi. Je t'aime mon amour. I see Babette's been teaching you a few French words. Bill, why did you tell the police that crazy leprechaun story? Because you wanted total honesty. Don't give me that. I want to know what was in that package you sent to Ireland. I told you, the leprechaun. We are not making love tonight until you tell me the truth. What? I got ripped off. I mean it, Bill. Top of the evening to you. Damn. What the hell was that?
