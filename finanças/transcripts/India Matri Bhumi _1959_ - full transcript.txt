THE ROSSELLINI PROJECT The digital restoration of the Italian version was carried out utilising the best available elements preserved by Cinecittà Studios and CSC - Cineteca Nazionale. An in-depth analysis of the materials, along with the valuable contribution of film historian Adriano Aprà, allowed for the identification of the most useful restoration elements: The internegative for the picture, an interpositive for the opening titles, a positive copy struck from the aforementioned internegative for sound, and a positive copy from that era to obtain the correct synchronisation. The image was scanned at a resolution of 2K. After being scanned, the image was digitally stabilised and cleaned, to eliminate the signs of age: Spotting, lines, scratches and visible splices. The colour correction process turned out to be an extremely complex operation because the colour had faded considerably. A copy from the time, preserved at the CSC - Cineteca Nazionale, and a copy printed by Cinecittà in the '90s were valuable references during this phase of the restoration, allowing us to recover details of the work of the cinematographer Aldo Tonti, and to determine the different types of film used: Gevaert, Ferrania, Kodak, 16 and 35 mm. With regard to the sound, a digital cleaning was performed in order to reduce background noises created by the passage of time and to restore the dynamics and the details of the original soundtrack. Throughout the length of the film, all of the components used exhibited small gaps of a few frames each that were impossible to fill. Restoration was carried out by the Cineteca of Bologna at the Immagine Ritrovata laboratories in 2011. The actors, all non-professional, were cast from the locations where the action takes place. For anyone coming from the West, Bombay has long been considered the gateway to India. On arrival, one feels instantly euphoric. The first thing that strikes us are the crowds. Tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people form an endless river that, however, has not destroyed the remains of what the Muslims, Parsis, English colonisers and others have built here. Sun, shade, wind, drought and monsoons have given these men and women an unmistakable patina, with their different religions and races, as they swarm around in masses. Farmers and city dwellers, as well as the old castes: The Brahmins, guardians of the faith, the Kshatriya, warriors, the Vaishyas, merchants, the Sudra, workers. The castes were formed according to various ethnic groups: The indigenous, Dravidian and Aryan peoples, Persians, Muslims, and all the other groups resulting from this mixing of peoples. The hum of hundreds of languages resounds in these teeming streets. Hindustani, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil, Sindhi, Punjabi, Rajasthani, Pali, Bhili. A confluence of peaceful peoples and of warriors become peaceful. These men wearing gilded turbans are Ismailis, ancient Muslim assault troops once known as Hashishins, from which the word "assassin" comes. The Ismailis are now a peaceful and hard-working people. This mixture of people and diverse elements makes up the Indian people, the most tolerant in all the world. They even tolerate this architecture. But they do try to improve it. This spirit of tolerance prepares them for any kind of transformation and evolution without racial prejudice or sacrificing their various ethnic characteristics. This crowd enjoys itself like any other crowd in the world. Merry-go-rounds. Pinwheels. Street musicians. Balloons. Windmills. And they stretch out, content. They are skilled craftsmen. And these people carry... bring... bring back... lift... load... support... shift... transport... transfer... and move. They walk... ruminate... sleep... dream... build... work... using modern methods... or traditional ones. The Indian people thrive on thousand-year-old traditions, preferring peace to war, tolerance to intolerance. They don't wish to convert anyone. But the more authentic India is found in its 580,000 villages. In just one-twentieth of the world's surface, lives one-sixth of the world's population. This harsh reality is the motor of modern India. Indians have a great knowledge of nature. They know they belong to it and know its secrets, its laws, and the fruits it produces. In the temples, the images of life appear like a grand celebration. It's the delirious expression of this people's love for life. Madurai is a holy city which boasts majestic architecture in its temples. This elephant was brought to the city for a religious ceremony. It comes from this immense jungle in Karrapur, where it worked, where it lived in the wild, where it was captured and tamed. Elephants are the bulldozers of India. Indians are so at one with nature, that by using kindness instead of strength, they have made elephants their working allies. Elephants only work three hours a day, from 7:00 to 10:00. Then it becomes too hot for them. Whereas we mahouts, the elephant drivers, get no rest at all during the day. After work, it's bath time. And believe me, it's quite a job. For two or three hours, they must be refreshed, splashed with water, then washed, rinsed down, pampered, stroked, and finally defleaed. After the bath, it's time for breakfast. Elephants eat between 600 and 800 kilos of food a day. Of course, it depends on the animal's height and size. Once we've served them, it's finally time for us have a bite to eat. During breakfast one day, we were joined by a company of puppeteers. I remember it very well. That was an important day in my life. Sir, is there a guest house around? We are from Mysore. We are here to put on a puppet show. We are looking for a guest house. The guesthouse is on the other side. - Where? - Over there. Thank you. Let's go. We don't even have time for a little amusement. Even at night, we need to be feed them 100 to 150 bales of straw with rice or grain, and give them more caresses and cuddles, too. What a life! The next day, I saw her again. For those of us who know elephants well, these bellows signify that they're falling in love. I'd be so happy. It's the only way I'm able to have some time off. Let's hope it's a serious love affair. I always worry at the start. The female elephants have less of a sense of modesty, while the males are rather reserved. They have, I'm sorry to say, more dignity. In the early afternoon, after their bath and breakfast, they need to be left alone in the jungle. They're shy, very shy... and modest, very modest. I saw her again. The next day, I took my the elephant back to the same tree for breakfast. And again the following day. I made an appointment with the schoolteacher and asked him to write a letter, a nice letter to my father so that he'd come and ask for her hand. - What do you want? - I'd like some help. What for? - To write a letter. - To whom? - To my father. - What do you want to say? Something nobody must know... ...regarding the puppeteers. - The girl, isn't it? - Yes, it's a serious matter. If you write it for me, it'll bring me luck. Let's begin with... "Dearest Father, I send you my fondest greetings. "I'd be very happy if you'd come here. "I must speak with you about my wedding." Yes, that's fine. The letter must have been well written, as a few days later, I found my father waiting for me when I came home from work. I was worried about my hat. It's a Muslim hat, the kind usually worn by mahouts. But since I'm Hindu not Muslim, I thought to myself, "My father won't tolerate it." He's a man of principles and he always criticises me. It's important to start a family, but one must reflect well first. Come, be seated. He met with the girl's father, and, following local etiquette, they each criticised their own children. This is the boy's father. - Tell me. - I want to talk about our children. My son has seen your daughter and wants to marry her. Both my son and I have jobs. We have some land... and do well for ourselves. This is sufficient for our children's tranquillity. Let God's will be done. We'll tell the priest about the ceremony. The marriage was arranged in accordance with the rules. That night, my father and I went to the temple to wait for the wedding ceremony. Until that moment, as is our custom, I wasn't permitted near my bride-to-be. She came to the temple on the morning bus. Ten months have passed. The female elephant has started to become irritated by the male's presence. This always happens when an elephant is ten months pregnant. As you know, their gestation lasts twenty months. Another female, wise and patient, comes to protect and assist her. As for me, my freedom has come to an end once again. I had to ask a neighbour to accompany my wife to her mother's house. I won't have time to look after her. She too is expecting a child. India's great rivers are born at the foot of the Himalayas. All the snow that melts on the roof of the world represents, for 400 million human beings, life. From the water blooms the calm beauty of lotus flowers. Everything that is extremely beautiful or useful is extremely sacred. When faced with death, the general belief is that when a man dies, his life doesn't end because he's reincarnated in another. But no one knows in whom. Therefore, all men are brothers. In the Shanti Parva a Brahmin tells a man mourning for his dead son, "You are despair itself, "for you don't despair for yourself, but for someone else." The poem also says, "I believe that my own soul does not belong to me, "but all creation belongs to me, "and by virtue of this certainty I am never too happy nor too sad." The Ganges is the river that purifies everything, and dissolves the ashes of the dead into nature. Benares, the holy city, descends steeply to the sacred banks of the river. Inside, the city is swarming with life. The water flows placidly by, indifferent to the architecture that it slowly swallows up. This is the Mahanadi River. It runs almost parallel to the Ganges. It's an example of the force of nature. No bridge withstands the fury of its waters when they swell after the monsoons. Attempts have been made to dominate this fury. In the Mahabharata, the great Indian epic poem, and in the Bhagavadgita, the philosophical book of life, it says that every word uttered and every action taken remain with us like an image reflected in a mirror. And judgement will only be pronounced later on. It's also says, "Both wise and ignorant people are equally happy. "Only the mediocre are unhappy. "The truth is in everything, even partially in what is untrue." Karma, meaning actions, represents man's duty. In Hirakud, a dam was constructed stretching 43 kilometres long. They are constructing the access roads. A huge artificial lake was created, and its level rises daily. The tree tops remind us that, once, the jungle stretched to this point. There were about 35,000 of us working on site. It was tough, yes. But we did it. Seven years of work. The time flew by for me, One strike of the pickaxe after another. One basketful of earth after another. Rock after rock. We dug, drilled, levelled, and built so much. And today, I, Devi Chakravarty, am here, waiting to see the site foreman. My wife's pouting because we have to leave. Our son was born here, so... The work is finished here. I've been assigned to another site. People like me are always in demand. Stop, please! Take this and go home. Let's go. It's amazing how much material was used... and how many tools, trucks and devices there were. An enormous quantity. Yes, I'd say I'm very proud to have built this dam. Now it seems like nothing. People just say, "A dam's been built." But no one imagines what it was like. I know how my wife feels. It's sad to leave all this behind. But she doesn't think about what we can do now. After all, more than one dam needs to be built in this life. 175 dead. But before, with all the floods, if we'd had to build a monument for the victims, we'd have needed one as long as this dam to inscribe all the names. Electricity, electricity. Magic, magic. Everything can be explained. Everything. You have to think. Magic no longer exists. Miracles no longer exist. Knowledge. More magic. More mystery. Knowledge. Knowledge. The Hirakud Dam. We have the right to feel proud. It's built from nothing. One basketful of earth after another. Rock after rock. And heart. Yes, we put our hearts into it. Poor brother. Death is sad for those who remain. But perhaps it's beautiful to dissolve into nature. I, Devi Chakravaty, and my wife... found refuge here when we were sent away from East Bengal due to the separation of Pakistan. Our son was born here. And here we set out to build this immense work. This little temple will also be swallowed up by the water. With all due respect, what, after all, is this little building compared to our dam? Our sacred lake will now be lost in the big lake. Who'd have thought then, when I took my ritual bath here, that my destiny would hold this surprise? Who could have thought that men like us would be able to create a lake where there was a little pond? Here she comes. Where are you? What are you doing? Leave me alone! What do you want? What are you doing here? I looked for you everywhere. Your head is always in the clouds. You come down here when we're about to leave? I don't understand you. Why not eat some more? We're full! We'll explode! We're not the only ones... No, thank you, we must get up early tomorrow. Goodbye! We'll meet again. Look after them. Can't you see they're standing? Please, have a seat. How's your family? Very well, thank you. Write to us. Don't forget us. Stay a little longer. - You're going? - I must go home. Write to us as well. Remember us. Why are you just standing there? Let's tidy up a bit. Careful not to trip! Our farewell party was pretty good. But now I must endure her whining. Another town, who knows how it will be? I'm fond of this house and the nice people here. Suddenly I have to leave everything. This is my destiny, never to have peace. We left our village, our field, and it's not over yet. I told you many times to try to stay here. But this man never listens to me! He's cold as a rock! He has no pity. Where will I go to live now? To Hell? I came here. I had a child. I raised him. To leave this house, this marvellous dam... To end up where? Oh, it's awful! My heart is breaking! Instead, this man has a heart of stone! I told you to prepare our things! Go! Move it! And so, we're leaving. Following the Indian coast to the West, one crosses vast plains, rich with water, which are perfect for growing rice. There isn't a square metre of land left unfarmed. India once had her fortresses. This is an ancient double-walled Muslim citadel with four gates. All that remains is a tiny village in the centre. The ancient mosque has been abandoned. Strange geological architecture. I am 80 years old. I've lived here all my life, yet I still find this forest fascinating and mysterious. Especially at night, when the tigers' love songs echo fantastically in the air. The jungle is the temple in which they celebrate their rites of love. When I awake with the first sliver of light, I'm surrounded by an explosion of joy. My wife and I don't need to exchange many words. Our gestures are enough, and the unchangeable solidarity expressed in our eyes. Besides, it's been a long time that our daily duties have been shared. What more is there to say? My two sons are married. Every morning, one of my daughters-in-law brings flowers for the customary divine tribute. My wife, like all of us, is very devout, and every morning, she thanks God, according to tradition. Hey, Rama! What are you doing? Come here. Go to that cowshed, milk the buffalo and then clear the cowshed. I'm too old to work now. My children have taken over. All I can do now is advise them. The only thing I need now is a contemplative life. Only one place in the world can satisfy my needs - the jungle. I love my cows. They're beautiful, strong beasts, and I take them everywhere with me. The women always have the same tasks to perform. When I'm alone in the jungle, I'm very aware of the presence of nature, and I feel I become one with it, little by little. There's a fair in the village of Sume. Can I go with Rakhma? I've often met this tiger that lives here. See how foolish men are, myself first of all! I can't help feeling scared. Yet I know it won't harm me. It walks away indifferently. One day, I was in the jungle with my cows. I remember I wanted to light a cigarette. Smoking is the last vice I have left. Suddenly, I heard a strange noise. It was three trucks. Out of curiosity I went towards the village. - What's going on? - They're getting iron. There's lots of iron. We'll get some work. They were prospectors searching for iron deposits. I'd often heard people talk of iron, but I thought it was just a legend. The next day, the men with the trucks started up a motor, and it was a complete disaster. That din chased all the animals out of the forest. Only the porcupines, stupid and selfish animals, remained. But the jungle was transformed. I realised that the natural equilibrium had been disturbed. I soon found evidence of how dramatic that change was. I found the remains of a porcupine and the bloodied tracks of the tiger. Unable to find other prey, it had pounced on the porcupine and been wounded by those terrible spines. That discovery frightened me. I know how dangerous an injured tiger can be. That's the moment when they become man-eaters. That roar and those human screams in the night were terrible signs. What I'd feared had happened. The tiger had attacked a man. The next day, my sons told me the iron prospectors had decided to organise a tiger hunt. Why kill? Isn't the world big enough for us all? The next morning, I thought I'd get into the forest before the hunters. I tried to convince the tiger to go elsewhere. Yes truly, the world is big. There's room for everyone. At times, heatwaves break out. The temperature rises dizzyingly. Water offers the only available respite. The roads are abandoned. The rivers are used instead. Village life almost grinds to a halt. A sky like steel. It was surely one of these heatwaves that took Dulip by surprise as he travelled with his monkey Ramu, to the festival of Baghdedi. Ramu the monkey has arrived alone in Baghdedi. She entertains the crowds as she's used to doing. She collects money she doesn't know the use of. The wild monkeys threaten her because she smells of man. The next day the pilgrims leave for their villages. Ramu is left alone. On her last legs, she gets adopted by a new master. And Ramu begins a new life. And again, the crowds... the enormous crowds. THE END
