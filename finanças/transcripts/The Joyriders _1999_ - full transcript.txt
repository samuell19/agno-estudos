Jodi. Come on, we gotta get out. Get out? What are you doing? ♪ Funhouse 69 ♪ ♪ Taking it all ♪ - Southwell! You're gonna die, Southwell! You're gonna die. I'm the fire starter! Hey, guys! I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you! Oh no. All our stuff, all our stuff. No, no, no, no, no. - What are you do- Oh, your bear. Sorry. - Who cares about that? All our stuff was in there. - We'll get new stuff. - Yeah, where are we gonna sleep? Where are we going to live? - I'll figure something out, all right? - I just did the laundry. - Sherman, Peabody. Stop it. Dearest Gordon, it's my fifth day at sea and I've been giving our life together lot of thought. For years we've been living two separate lives. Your depression and hopelessness has shut me out. Gordon, no matter how difficult things have been, I do miss you, but living without love, affection or communication has taken its toll. I can't do it anymore. I would like to think you still believe there is something worth living for, something that would make you want to fight, for us. But deep down, I know it would take an act of God to turn this marriage around. - Peabody, Sherman. Let's go Who is it for, Peabody? My cruise ship will dock in San Diego. If there's any chance of saving what's left of our marriage, I pray you'll be there. I hope you're going to clean that up. - Actually, I'm not. You want to save our marriage? I'll save our marriage. Oh. Well, I tried. I just keep thinking how long it's been since we had a real Christmas. With a man around the house. Oh, Jodi, honey, I have a feeling you're really going to like Cliff. He's going to make a great husband, even though he's turned your kid brothers into army brats. - So send me a ticket and I'll fly down. Oh yeah, so you'll... - It's my mom, my mom. - And by drugs for your friends? - Thanks, ma, I love you, too. - Oh, come on. What do you expect from me? You run away from a good home- - Good home? What are you, high? Jodi. The door's open. You do what you want. You always have. - 50 bucks? Where did you get that? - Donation. For abused kids. Hey, it's Christmas, right? - All righty. - No, that's okay. I don't have to see it. - Okay, then. If you just want to sign right here. We'll have you on your way. Now if you're interested in a good shooting range, there's a place just- - It's a gift. For myself. - Okay, well, in that case... - Excuse me. Can you spare some change? It's actually for a good cause, my, my... Merry Christmas. - It's freezing out here. What are you doing? - Nothing. So have you figured out where you're staying tonight? I don't know. Maybe the Ramada or the Hilton. - Yeah, right. - I'm serious. Somebody gave Cam 50 bucks. - Seriously? Wow. I wonder what he had to do for it. - Ho, ho, ho. Santa's got some stuff. You ready? All right. Lamb's wool sweater straight from Scotland. Heated socks, nine volt battery included for you. - I always wanted these. - Yes. Ear muffs and gloves. Ooh, one last thing. Close your eyes, please. Okay, open 'em. - All of that for 50 bucks? Yeah. - Excuse me, mister, um... Me and my sister have been calling our parents to give us a ride, but they're not home and um, we were wondering if maybe you can give us a lift? - Sorry. - Please, mister. It's getting late and it's cold and we have no way to get home, so, please? - Well, where do you live? Just a few minutes from here. - Well, I'm heading to Lockesburg. - That's perfect. - That's good. - Well okay, but uh... Brush off your shoes first, please. Oh, um, this is our brother. Can you give him a ride, too, mister? Wipe your feet off first. - Well, one thing, kids. When you drive in this car, you wear a seatbelt. Feet off the dash. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey. - Knock it off. Do you have a problem? Stop. - Pass it up, just give me the broom. Give me the broom. Give me the broom. - Are you a wise guy? Give me the broom. So uh... Were you doing some Christmas shopping? - No, sir. We went to a movie. Really? Which one? - I don't remember, 'cause we, we left early. - All right. Out of the car. Now! Come on, out. - What's with you? - All right, let's go. Hey, stop! - Out. Stop it, that hurts. Enough with the shenanigans. That's it. - Get your hands off me. Look, we didn't do anything. - Get out, out of the car. Stop it, let go of me. Listen, you're really hurting her. Come on, stop! - I don't believe this. - Stupid idiot, what are you doing? - Watch it, I'm trying to drive. Cam, I am not kidding. You gotta turn this car around right now. - Sit back and put your seat belt on. - Oh great. Hey. I can't believe this. Cam. - Come on. We were just kidding around. Hey, don't hurt him, okay, Cam? Just get back in the car, all right? Don't listen to her. Come on! Cam? Hey! Cam, what did I say? - Wow, it's freezing. Can I say something? You kids are making a big mistake. 12 bucks? That's it? - That's a short trip in this gas duster. And I bet you use super, don't you? - Where's the rest of your money? - Hey, will you cut it out? This is stupid.

It's a free concert from now on. One major thing you have to remember tonight when you go back up in the woods to go to sleep or if you stay here, is that the man next to you is your brother and you damn well better treat each other that way because if you don't, then we blow the whole thing, but we've got it right there. Stop, Cam. - What? I thought we were going to party. - No way. - Oh, come on. No. - Come on. - Get off of me. - You know, I'm just trying to have a little bit of fun. - Just stay away. - Where am I supposed to sleep? - That's your bed. - With Fish-Man.

All right? I'm sorry. - You're always saying you're sorry. This time it's not enough. Get out of my way. - What? It was a joke. It was funny. I was kidding, right, Fish-Man?

I mean, how do we know he's not over at a friend's house? - What friends? - My father rarely leaves the house. Besides, look at this. He's been gone for three days now. - Well, this doesn't necessarily mean anything. I mean, he could have got tired of your mother's cooking. Any marital problems? - Not that I know of. - Excuse me? - He wasn't happy about her going off on a cruise by herself. What? What else do you want me to say? - My father-in-law tried to commit suicide- - That was 15 years ago. - Well, excuse me, Donald, but isn't that the reason we're so worried? - His business failed, his partner, his best friend in the world screwed him up the wazoo. - All right.

Clearly he was in fear for his life. - This is a registration for a hand gun purchased December 2nd by your father. Same gun you saw him holding on those girls. - So just what exactly are you trying to say? - He probably was kidnapped. - Probably? What else could it be? - Well, there is some confusion. Your father was stopped in Southern Oregon and there were three very nervous minors in the car. - Oh my god. - Now we're running a check on them right now. In the meantime, we're not ruling anything out. Well I guess we can rule out suicide. Anyway, I'll be in touch.

You didn't need it, but he didn't know that. - What's wrong with this thing? I can't get through to 911. - Call the operator. They'll connect you. I don't know, maybe you're right. Maybe they would be better off in jail. Tried as adults, put in with hardened criminals. Can't be any worse than what they grew up in. Crystal learned the meaning of hot when her mother burned her with cigarettes. Hello, this is the operator. How may I help you? - Hello. Uh, yes. Could you please connect me to the local police? This is an emergency. - Look. Those kids did a terrible thing kidnapping you, but they're young and they can change. They're at a critical point now. So I'm asking you, Gordon. I'll beg you if I have to. I want just one adult besides myself giving these kids another chance. I'm finished. Fresno Police, please hold. It's up to you and God now.

I know you're anxious to get going, but how'd you like to join me for a soak in my healing waters? - Thank you, but I really must get home. I must. Well your car's in the driveway behind the garage. It's been a pleasure. - Hi. I'm glad you're feeling better. - Yes I am. - I bought you this. It's kind of a get well present. - It's not necessary. - Bottle of aspirin, extra strength, Dr. Scholl's bunion pads, tube of Colgate, and a toothbrush. Medium bristle, not firm. - No Bromo?

But I got to tell you, I have serious doubts. She's just not going to make it on the street. If it wasn't for Cam looking after her, God knows what would've happened. Something's bothering me, brother. Why were you kidnapped? - What? - Have you thought about that? I mean, in the deeper sense. - What are you talking about? - Bear with me here a moment, 'cause I've been giving this some serious thought. Now I don't know what's been going on in your life, but it's my belief that somehow, some way God came through for you. It's something to think about. - You're some operator, you know that? But you're wasting your time. I'm not about to be baptized here in your hot tub. I think you better let him up. Sorry, kid, I scare ya? Good. Just a little private matter. He reminds me of me at his age. - I can see that. I don't know which one of you is worse. - It's a long haul, Fish-Man, so I thought you could use some driving music. - What about my credit cards? Hey, wait, wait. You didn't sign my cast. Sorry. I guess you weren't such a dud after all. - Thanks again, Gordon. You sure you don't want to trade? This baby would make a terrific prize for the church raffle. - I don't think so. Three kids, right? I don't see 'em. They're probably armed. Watch yourself. Okay, check the floor. They're not in here. - All right, you can put your hands down now. You want to open the trunk, please? - Can I ask you what you're looking for? I'm on my way back to Seattle. I've got a long trip ahead of me. - All right. Where'd the kids go? - Well they're not in there. - Where are they? - I've decided not to press charges. - Let me explain something to you. Mr. Trout. Interstate kidnapping is a serious offense. Now just because you've decided you don't want to press charges, that doesn't mean a crime hasn't been committed. Now you're going to have to come down to the station and answer some questions. - How long is this going to take? - You want to ride with us or do you want to follow behind? Changed my mind. - You want to be baptized? - I want to trade. My Cadi for your truck. But it's got to run. It runs all right, but it's still not an even trade. Now, let's say we get this started. Get Jodi by Christmas.

The reason I'm calling is to tell you that I'm all right. But dad, you're wanted by the police. They said to me- - I don't care what they said to you. You ran away from them? - Does your mother know? - She called here when you didn't show up in Puerto Vallarta. She's cutting her trip short. She'll be docking in San Diego on the 26th. San Diego? - You're putting your mother in danger. Hold it, one second. - Dad? - Is that the 26th? - Yeah. - At what time? - I don't know. Morning. Look, where are you? I don't wanna tell you. - But... What do you mean you don't want to tell me? I've gotta go. The kids need me. - What? You're still with them? Uh, listen, you're not suffering from that, uh, Patty Hearst syndrome, are you? You know, identifying with your kidnappers? Stop that. They're just kids. - Come on, dad. You can't believe that. This girl is wanted for prostitution. She cut up her foster father the day you were kidnapped. And the boy's got a rap sheet you can't believe. - Donald, son... - If they're caught, they're going back to juvenile hall or worse. You can bet on that. - Donald. - And then- - Do I tell you I love you enough? What? Dad? Dad? Dad? - What? Crystal, what are you doin' in the men's room? - Come to the party. - What do you think you're doing? - It's okay. I asked him. I can't go home with a cast on my arm. - Here, take this. Give me the saw. - Cool, snacks. - Hold very still. - 12412. Okay, 12418. This is good, you can let me out here. - Now remember we'll be at the Quality Court till tomorrow. Room 420. Just in case you want to reach us for any reason. - She won't need to. We're going to miss you. You kept us, ah, well, you tried to keep us honest. We'll send you a pinata from Mexico, okay? - Thanks. Bye, Cam. - Yeah. Take it easy. - Don't I get a kiss? - Yeah. - I'm sorry for what we did. But I'm sorta not, you know? She's here! Let me look at you. You outdid yourself this time, Celeste. - Thank you. - Mom, it was fantastic. - And you never told me your daughter was such a looker. - Well, of course she's a looker. I mean, after all, she takes after her mama. You tired? - No. - How about a now? - No. I gotta get goin'. Come on, Jenny, get your sweater, sweetie. - What do you mean? - I told you, Jenny and I are going to her mom's for Christmas Eve. Get your coat. Come on, Jenny. - No, Jenny, wait a minute. You didn't tell me that. This is the first time I've heard about it. - What did I tell you at the base? Remember? After the party, I said that we're going to come back here and have dinner with your daughter and then I was going to take Jenny, I was going to take Jenny over to her mother's for Christmas Eve. I told you. - No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, please. No, it's too much for me. Um, look, my daughter is home. I have not seen her for almost a year. You're not just gonna walk out like this. - Listen, Jodi and I will have plenty of time to get to know each other, right? Huh? - Well, here's your jacket and I'm wearing it, so you can't go. Cold in here without you. Don't go away. - Come on. - No. - Come on, baby. - Come on, please. Just stay. - Give me my- - Just stay with me. Just give me the coat. - I'm not giving you the coat. I want you to stay. Please. - Give me the coat. - No! - Now, Celeste. Don't act like this in front of your daughter, okay? - I'm sorry. - Now come on. - I'm sorry. - Come on. Jenny. - Look. Please- - March. - Grab your sweater, Jenny. - Just tell me when you're gonna come back. When can I expect you back? When are you coming back? Just... - Don't push me, Celeste. - I'm not pushing you. I just wanna know when you're gonna come back, just... - Mom? Mom, did you see what I got you for Christmas? You want to open it now? - No, I don't want, no. I don't wanna open anything. Just leave me alone. Just leave okay? Look, I just want a drink, that's all. You know what I mean. Don't bug me when I'm drinking. I've told you that. - You know, she might not take me back. It might be too late. But I'm going to be there. And the moment she walks off that boat, the first thing she's going to see is me. - That is so rad, Fish-Man. - Yeah. - That's awesome. - So, what are your plans? - We're going to Mexico to enjoy a lovely burrito by the water. - Burritos rock. - That's not a plan. - Yeah? What do you know about it, Fish-Man? - Nothing, but running away from your problems doesn't solve anything. That much I do know. - You know, Fish-Man, you might want to leave the preaching up to the preacher man. You kind of stink at it. - Yeah, I suppose I do. Yep. - Waiter. Sir. I think there's a mistake here. Shouldn't that be 47? - Mm-hm. That is a seven. - Oh. Sorry. Thank you. You're gonna need bifocals. Wow. Man. I thought only I got treated like that. - Well... - No, I got it. I got it. No, I got it. See, the guy is wrong. It's not seven. It's ate. - Crystal. Uh oh. - Come on, let's get out of here. - Uh oh. - Come on. Let's go. - Mom? Mom, are you all right? - Just, just close the door. I want you out. Tonight. - What did... What did I do? - You think I didn't see what you were up to tonight? You think I didn't see the looks you were giving to my fiance? - Mom? What are you talking about? - Don't act stupid with me, Jodi. - I know you. And you're not going to pull any of your dirty little tricks on Cliff the way you did with Jack. - My stepfather raped me and you know it. - Shut up. I don't want to hear that! You're a liar and you're not going to drive another husband out of my life! - I need you, mom. I spent eight months on the street and I am not going back. - That was your choice. - This is my home, too. - No. It isn't your home. It's my home. So get out. Get out now. Get out! Get out now! Just get out! Get out! Get out. - Woo! - You think he's safe? I mean a gust of wind could, could suck him under or something. Woo! - He'll be fine. I don't know, Jodi said that he didn't even know his father, but, supposedly he sent him a toy train for Christmas once. Pathetic, isn't it? - Woo! - And then when his father dies, James Stewart inherits his savings and loan and then it runs into financial problems and then see, the banker is played by Lionel Barrymore and he's a mean guy and anyway, he won't lend him the money and then he gets into all kinds of trouble. And then when he, when he says I wish I was dead, then the angel says to him okay, I'm going to show you what it will be like if you were never born. So then he takes him out and then uh, and if he was never born, then he wouldn't have a wife and he wouldn't have, you know, any relatives or any, any friends in the town and he can't understand it. And he goes through this emotional thing and he winds up on the top of a bridge and he's about to jump off. And, and it's, I shouldn't tell you too much about it though, because I'm ruining it for you, you know? Well anyway. I can't believe you haven't seen it. It's on every year. - Do you have any quarters? - Quarters? Yeah. Yeah. - Thanks. - I don't know, you'll probably think it's dated but Donna Reed, I was in love with Donna Reed. Jodi? Jodi, what are you doing here? Jodi. - I, I thought I'd stop by and surprise you. The manager let me in - What happened? - What did she do? - It's not worth talking about, so, what are you guys up to? - I'm so sorry. What can I do? - Jodi, what's going on? What did you do? - This girl has taken an overdose of pills. Her pulse rate is way down. - Someone will be right up to take her in. Meanwhile, I can start filling out these forms. Um, her name? Sir, are you a relative? We're going to need a parent or guardian's consent. - I'm her grandfather. Shoved in line ahead of me, Jodi. Should have been me lying there, not you. Last thing I expected is to be woken up by some crazy kids. I just wish I could take it all away. Of all people, I should know the right things to say, but, I never was very good with words. Hey. We were one crazy family though, weren't me? You're a good kid, Jodi. Don't let anyone ever tell you that you're not. I have to go. But I'll be back in a few days. That's a promise. Okay, you guys... - She's going to be all right. We should get going. You coming or not? - Who's going to stay with her? - Fish-Man. I mean, unless you want to hang out here and get busted. - Eh... All right. Drop me off to the bus station. - Excuse me? - Fish-Man's covering my bus fare back to Seattle. - What a loser. So um... What's up in Seattle? - Eh... Eddie knows this guy who runs this place, and uh, he thought maybe we could hook up. - You? You're going to work at a job? - Why not? - Yeah, that'll last. - What? - Son of a gun. ♪ Now I've been high ♪ ♪ And I've been low ♪ ♪ I've been some places that you would not go ♪ ♪ I never thought there would come the day ♪ ♪ When I wish I never would have left this way ♪ ♪ But I've been searching for a long, long time ♪ ♪ I thought the devil was a friend of mine ♪ ♪ I turned my back on everything that was true ♪ ♪ I wasted years that belonged to you ♪ ♪ Oh, oh ♪ ♪ Some people gotta learn the hard way ♪ All right, step out of the car.

Hey, he's got my jacket. - Yep, that's him. Let's go. - Suspect is on foot entering the north gate. Attention all passengers, please proceed now through.... - Okay, we've got him heading towards the gangplank. Be cool, just follow my lead. Please proceed now through customs. - Barbara! Barbara! Barbara! Barbara! Dear Crystal, you don't know me, but my husband, Gordon, has told me all about you. We've been praying that your release from juvenile hall will be soon. A lot has happened lately. Jodi is officially the newest member of the Trout family, and Cam's got a job working as a mechanic, thanks to Eddie. Cam is also helping out with a street ministry for runaways. Eddie hopes to get Gordon baptized in his hot tub before summer. You know, I think he might actually succeed. I know the world's been tough on you, Crystal, and I understand how it feels to be hopeless about the future, but God does love you. Don't give up. And when you get out, come stay with your extended family.
