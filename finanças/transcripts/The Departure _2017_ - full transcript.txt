Welcome to the departure. Let me explain what we're going to be doing. The goal is for you to experience "departure." Today we're holding this retreat for you to find out what it means to die how it will feel when you're departing from this world. When you have suicidal thoughts, you should think about what you'll leave behind. If you could only have three things left in the world, what would they be? Write them on three strips. Body, house, food The necklace my mother gave me The bed my grandfather made Next let's think about three people who are important to you. Besides myself? Myself is good, too. It would be totally fine to put that. Lastly, write down what you'd like to try. Or it can be something you've started and want to continue. Quit my job Travel the whole world Now we have nine. Please pick three and crumple them and throw them away. Eating delicious food From the six things you have left pick another three. Choose three and throw them away. Now remove two out of the three things left. Now you only have one left. Travel the whole world Body The Earth (mountain, ocean, air, ground) Love - loving, and being loved Now, please throw away the last one. Mother My memories Now you've lost everything. This is death. This is death. Thanks to the people helping me here today I was finally able to feel grateful. I've attempted to kill myself before, but I never succeeded. I tried inhaling gas and overdosing on medication, but still couldn't die. I couldn't die before, but today I died and was reborn. I have cats waiting at home, and my family who's been so supportive. I have to be thankful for them as I keep on living. I almost cried as I listened to everyone's words, because they resonated with me. When you feel anxious or when you're thinking about death, and fear overtakes you you can recall what you did today, and remember it's a road we've all travelled. Wait a second. - Where's your toy police car? - Yeah. Let's go. Here, put on your shoes. Shoes! Shoes! Do you want sandals? Or rain boots? - He prefers rain boots. - You want your rain boots? He must still be sleepy. STOP THE SUICIDE TO PROTECT HEARTS AND LIVES We're going to be discussing the serious social phenomenon of suicide. Mr. Nemoto is a priest of the Zen sect. Thank you. I've been working on suicide prevention for ten years. I'm trying to figure out why people become so desperate that they commit suicide. Mr. Nemoto, when you counsel people for the first time do you do something in particular or say something special to them? People come and tell me they have no hope, and that there's no reason for them to live. So I say there's no point in chasing something that isn't there. Instead, let's create our own hope by being together. I want to die. Excuse me, here's some tea. Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. Here you go. Recently I poured gasoline all over my bed sheet. I grabbed a bunch of toilet bowl cleaner, and said, "All right, let's light this sucker up." Unbelievable. Your condition hasn't changed in six months? Not at all. I'm so concerned about my kids. How are they? You see them once a month now, right? Yes. - I got to see them twice this month. - Ah, that's good. The day I see my kids is the farthest from the next day I'll see them again, so I always get sick that night. What's it like when you're sick? You can't get up? If I do get up, I just sit in front of my computer and smoke. The computer's on, but I don't even touch it. I know I have to keep moving forward but often I feel like killing myself after I see my kids. Why do you want to die? Because the waiting gets too unbearable. You would break their hearts very badly. Right? This is about life. I'm sure they'd want you to live no matter what. I'm sure they know how much you look forward to seeing them. All I want to do is help my kids. But it's not that easy. Thanks for the meal. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. It was delicious, thanks. When I talk with people who are contemplating suicide I can see their point, and sympathize with them. I always think I have to do so much but I can't stop feeling empty inside. I've learned through experience that I can't save anyone. I try to create an atmosphere that makes it possible for them to share their problems. It might take time, and I might have to try different things. There is no manual, or one right way. I know I shouldn’t die, but I just can’t stand myself. I feel so useless. Make sure to let me know before you die. If you ever decide to… I need to know the why before you do it, you know? I actually wanted to hear your voice one last time before taking the pills. But I didn't want to cause any more trouble. You’re not any trouble. I think it's important for people to know that death means forever disappearing. And you'll be losing something important by dying. So we find things that would be hard to lose and then we focus on treasuring those. We'll find a way to make things better for you, little by little. Okay. You’ve been fighting hard for so long, you should reward yourself once in a while. Have something nice, like ice cream. I'll try and switch my thinking, too. I do want to keep seeing the cherry blossoms every year. That's right. When I was counseling, I thought, what would have happened if we hadn't talked? This person wasn't being treated at a hospital. They couldn't even go, they were too ashamed. But after talking to you, they realized it wasn't such a big deal. That's why I can't quit doing this kind of work. If I didn't do it, and they died… You can't say no when you’re asked. It’s hard… I take on so much of their suffering when I'm counseling. I have to put on a strong face. I can never show them how draining it is. Well, just don't push yourself too hard. I'd like to do some theater games to help us connect with each other. I think humans have always had dances, ceremonies, rituals because we live in an irrational world, where we're born and then we die. We're given life without choice, and have to struggle along the path to death. It's a very irrational thing. But through art, and through expression maybe people can find a reason. I wonder these days I wonder vaguely why I'm living. Why you're living… There's got to be a meaning of life for every person. Well, does there? I mean, does a river have a meaning? I saw your email. Are you okay? Call me. I have to see you immediately. I feel like my life has no meaning. I can't survive alone anymore. I lost my job I fail at everything I try. I should just disappear. You can't die yet. Make yourself believe that it's not your time to leave this world. 8 missed calls So you're having an exam for pulmonary emphysema, correct? Right, they say I have it. - So you didn't quit smoking. - Yes, that's right. Do you have problems with your chest hurting? Yes, I do. Like, from my back. It feels stiff. And sometimes… Not like piercing, but it's like my chest tightens. How often? It's like, there's always this heavy feeling. Like when I'm tired, my chest starts to hurt. Or I'm short of breath. That's been a problem lately. - When I drink alcohol… - You get out of breath. My pulse gets heavier than usual. Well, your lungs have enlarged, and it seems to be taking a toll on them. They enlarged? Yeah, they enlarge and expand. And the real problem seems to be your arteries. - This one. - I see. It seems like it could get clogged at any time. - Of course, stress is also a factor. - I see. And anxiety and such. That seems to be the case when someone your age has bad arteries or a bad heart. Okay, let's eat. Let's eat. How have you been feeling? Not so well. We were talking about that earlier. What? You're going to try to lessen your workload and rest, right? Hmm… Well… If you don't lessen your workload you'll have another heart attack. It's good to exercise. - You don't exercise. - Yeah. Yeah. But I've been planting rice a lot. I wonder why you get so busy. There's always something that needs to be done. - He ate all the rice? - I guess it was good. - Wow. - The fish rice. Good boy, Teppei. It gets so busy that I can't even fill in the planner. You're busy from the morning of the 27th. Yeah. So the morning of this day is the only time… For Teppei. To be with him. Yeah, that's right. Well, I've been through a lot, Mr. Nemoto. You know nothing's left here. Nothing's left? We still have our relationship, you and me. I guess you're right. But when you're doing drugs you cause the people around you so much trouble. There's nothing left, is there? Everything is lost. When did you first start using drugs? You have, what, a 30-year history? You have 30 years of experience. What was that? Well, that's kind of impressive, you've done it for 30 years. You have to appreciate the fact that you're still alive. It's true. It's really true. Yeah. You know, with you, it's a strange connection. I think I could smile the next time I see you. In a way, you're strong, since you're starting from scratch. You've hit rock bottom, and now… Yeah, in a way all I can do is climb back up. I've been reflecting on that. I don't want to forget this feeling in the future. - You’re going now? - I'm going. What time are you coming back? Let's see. I'll try to come back as soon as I can, but what time… Thanks for staying with Teppei. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. My first experience with suicide was with someone close to me. It happened when I was young. My uncle committed suicide. I was a fifth-grader then. And I wondered what it meant. The uncle who died was the one who was always kind and fun to be around. Then a middle school friend, and a bandmate from high school two people who were really close to me, seemingly healthy, committed suicide after graduation. The shock from not just the deaths, but from the fact that the suicides were multiplying one by one… I couldn't understand it at all. What made them feel like they needed to die? I needed to know the reason. Every year, I give memorial services for the three of them. I write messages to them every time. All three were wonderful people, I admired them. I wanted to lead life like they did. Why they had to kill themselves is the question I haven't yet resolved. You must be tired, let's sit. Okay. Oh, my. He's acting like this because you came home. He was playing happily a while ago. Let's tell your dad, "welcome home." I can see it. Should we get the cat toy? He just wants to be with mom. It's a shame he's doing this when you just got home. Teppei! I don't know. Does your grandfather know I'm coming today? No. - Please have some. - Oh, really? Okay then. I have a drink every night. - Every night? - Yes. So you drink every day, but at 84 you're still so healthy. What's the secret? I don't think about anything. It's hard to not think about anything. We have a tendency to think about silly things. That's right. I wish I could stop doing that. It's like you've become enlightened. I think it's amazing. It seems like anxiety comes from trying to do so many things from what I'm hearing. But to say, "That's enough. I don't have to do anything." The feeling of having to do something is what gets in the way. What kind of things have you been thinking about lately? - Recently? - Yeah. Hmm… - I've been a bit depressed lately. - Uh-huh. - I was doing well at one point. - That's right. Yes. - Then I got depressed all of a sudden. - Suddenly? Suddenly. Yeah. I feel uncertain about the future. I'm not certain about my future, either, when I'm depressed. I wonder what I should do. I get worried. If I could be certain, I could be more confident, I think. Let's learn from your grandfather. I want to do that, too. So should we make a plan? We should both experiment and then come back here and report to your grandfather on how we've changed. - Could I use your restroom? - What? - Could I use your restroom? The toilet. - Oh, the toilet. From here. Go through the big room. Okay. Okay, I’m going to go to the bathroom. What is this? - What? - Is this a life consultation? - Yes. - What is this? How did you meet him? - Well, it was at some kind of event. - What? - It was some event at a temple. - Uh-huh. I went there, and met him. And you asked him stuff? Yeah. And I visited him about three times. - Really? - Uh-huh. - Are you good on time? - Yeah, I’m okay. My granddaughter is consulting you about a lot of things. Yes, she is. Life consultation? Something like that? And it seems she's been feeling down recently, so I got worried, and we talked about my coming to visit. Well, she should be a bit stronger. Well, I don't know. What? I don't know. She seems to be pretty strong. Well, hmm. No matter who you ask advice from, in the end you have to make your own decision. But you must have had worries and hard times, too, during your lifetime. - Of course. - What did you do during those times? - You have to solve it on your own. - Hmm. You shouldn't depend on others. But if you bottle up everything inside, it's hard to move in the right direction. People have to make their own decisions. You can't tell them this and that. You have to look after yourself. See, when all of these blood vessels get bad, we're talking surgery. You might even need bypass surgery - but you're so young! It's a difficult situation. What I wanted to ask you is that, if my heart is this plugged up… - What about other places like the brain? - Yes, it's possible. - We haven't examined them, though. - Right, we haven't examined them. It's like, if a blood vessel this big can get clogged, I start to worry. - What about other parts? - It's possible, it's possible. I overworked myself. Responding to emails and answering the phone. I did that too much. I'd be answering 50 messages a day. You just never rested. - The phone just kept ringing and ringing… - In the morning, late at night… People would hang up and call right back. Like one person called at eight a.m. every morning. They'd call every morning at the same time because they'd get nervous around then. I don't think it's possible to answer other people when you're not taking care of yourself. Really? What about when you die? Sometimes there are dying hermits, and every word they say is meaningful. Or they use their last bit of energy to make one final stroke. They have a lot to say. Is it because I got sick so young? Does that make me a hypocrite? Yes. If you're not physically well, it means you're not mentally well, either. You're speaking to others when you're weak yourself. I feel like you can't have good results with that. Well, I'm not going to stop. I've had it. I just want to get it over with. This is rice for you, I grew it. - Thank you. - Have it when you're hungry. Eat it when you feel sad. Chew hard and it'll help you forget your pain. Okay. So many toys. The next appointment to see my kids is the 26th. That's soon. Yes. What time do you normally see them? - From four to five p.m., for an hour. - Only an hour? Yes. - Both of them together? - Yes. - Once a month? - Yes. I give them snacks, we play ball and tag in the park nearby then it's done. I feel like I'm dead. It would be too much pain for your kids to bear if you committed suicide on them. The bereaved of those who commit suicide can't escape the pain for the rest of their lives. Maybe it would be okay if I die in an accident, not suicide. That's not making sense. You're looking forward to seeing them. But killing yourself means you're taking those opportunities away from yourself. I don't understand why you want to give up on watching them grow up. I know you're suffering I see how you're becoming less motivated to live on. But if you really care about your kids, you can't die. Be there for them, so they can come to you when things get hard. If you aren't there for them, where can they go? My father was… …well, he wasn't what you'd call a model father. He lived the life of a drunk. My parents got divorced when I started middle school so we became a fatherless family. I was a bad kid. I started a band when I was in middle school. I started out on electric guitar. Along with playing in bands, I went dancing at night, at what were called "discos" back then. I danced until dawn, and then went to school. At that time, there were kids called "midnight wanderers" who wandered the streets in the middle of the night, and we were a part of that. We were more of the rebellious type, discontent with society. Going out all night was the only way I could release all my tension. I used to pick fights all the time because I thought that it was all about strength. I believed that if our society collapsed, only the strong would survive. When I was 24, I was in a big motorcycle accident. I was unconscious for six hours, and hospitalized for three months. They had to put a balloon inside my face to keep it from sinking, and I had to have surgery. I was a real mess. I was in the hospital when I met my wife, Yuki. She was a nursing student there. After that, I wasn't able to lead this messed-up life anymore. I just felt so ridiculous. Even with my friends, I was like, "I don't care about this kind of lifestyle anymore." Then, one day, my mother saw an ad in the newspaper that said "Monk wanted. No experience necessary." And we were like, "What? What is this?" We couldn't believe that there was actually an ad in the paper for priests. And that people with no experience could apply. So I entered the priesthood. And here I am. Teppei! What's up? Let’s bring flowers to Grandma. What? Can you bring flowers to Grandma? Hey, you got a big one. That one's for Grandma. - Tell her it’s a souvenir. - A souvenir. You know, when Teppei was born, everyone talked about him being your successor. But who knows what'll happen to our temple by the time he’s 20? I want him to choose his life. He can do it when he wants to. A child is always looking up to his father without being asked. So I hope you're aware that you’re always being watched. Yeah. Show him with your mannerisms more than with words. What kind of mannerisms? He’s carefully watching what you do every day. But forgets most of what you say to him, even if you yap. - You mean he remembers it as an impression. - Yes. I’m not really sure. I don’t know if I can teach him well. Just please stay healthy for 20 more years. I wish my nurse would teach me how to live. The bridge. The bridge. Should we walk to the bridge? Now I'll say something that will remind us of a reason to live and then please repeat it one to the next. Okay, let's try it. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you! I love you! I love you! Hi there. I'm about to head back home to the temple. A few people from the retreat are coming over, and might stay the night. Yeah, sorry about that. Let's drink! Sometimes I think I don't need emotions. They just get in the way. That's true. Emotions… Where do they come from? I don't know, but they're really a nuisance sometimes. They're a burden. Emotions. Common sense. Family. They're all important, but they get in the way. Do you often drink at night? I usually don't. But this week I've been drinking every day. And through the night! Every day until the sun comes up, even after the sun comes up, the drinking continues. - Is that okay for your health? - No, not really. A dancing priest! It's burning really well. These are actually beams from an old Buddhist temple. - But… - What! These were hewn by people from 300 years ago. So sorry! Whoa, we're burning that? I was shocked too. It's okay, we don't need them any more, so I thought this was the perfect occasion to use them. Wood that was prepared by people 300 years ago is burning here today. I don't want to live a long life just for the sake of it. A short life can be meaningful, too. You could take this to mean that I'm not treating my life as a precious thing. Maybe from the outside it looks suicidal. But for me, my goal is to give everything I have. The voice in your head, what is it like? It says, "Die!" for example. "It doesn't matter if you exist or not." Wow, it says some cruel things. It's hard to distinguish the reality from the hallucination. And it's hard to live like that. When I asked the doctor about it, he said to me "You're hearing what you're thinking." That's what he said to me. I heard that it's impossible to completely cure it. It's just another perspective. If the voices tell you to die you should say, "I'm killing myself." Meaning you're killing worthless desires, or the dark side of yourself. You chant, "Die, die" with them. I wonder if that's possible? Are you all right? I'm sorry… I'm not being much help, am I? I thought you were getting better. You were eating better these days. We tried steamed rice with barley. I didn't like whole-grain barley. Oh, I'm sorry about that. There was nothing else available then. Ouch. Okay, right this way. If that's all right? Okay. Are you okay? Not feeling any dizziness? Just a little bit. So these blood vessels in front it's worse than before. - That's amazing. - Right? It's about 95% narrower. Now if this tears, a blood clot forms, and in the worst case scenario you have a heart attack. I think you should limit your intake of sugars. You drink a lot. Do you drink sake? Shochu and stuff like that. Of course it all depends on the amount. You know, don't drink too much. Okay, so we'll extend your hospital stay. When it comes to other people, I have no problem giving out advice. But when it's about me, it's really difficult. I've been sort of lost recently. It'd be nice to know exactly what to do. In the end, I really just need to reevaluate my priorities, right? Yeah. The whole reason why I'm in this situation right now is because I have misguided values, right? So it's a matter of values. Or rather, determining what it is that makes me do what I do. - Hey, boy. - To change your values… See you later! This is very scary. This is what happens when you mix medication. What? This cold medication is scary. Well, the combination of cold medication and tranquilizer is bad. And this is what happens. This medicine from the psychiatrist, it's the strongest one they prescribe at the hospital. Whoa, look at you, it's all instant noodles. There are so many different types of medication in here. How did you manage to get so many? It's for diabetes and the operation I had the other day. Last month I had an operation on my foot. - You had an operation on your foot? - Yes. Well, I had a boil that was getting too big, like a tumor. I was riding my bike right near my house, on the main street. A car came out from behind a store turned left without checking. I was riding in the bike lane, and I got hit and flew off. Wait, hold on. So the car hit you, and what did he say? That I didn't have my light on. But I was holding a flashlight in my hand! Oh, so the driver said he wasn't at fault that it was your fault for not turning on the light. So he called the police, and I told him I have a mental illness. So why did the police come? You're the victim, right? Well, I am the victim, but I left the scene after beating the guy up. I beat the driver up with my flashlight. So I was charged. Is it okay to take so much? I realized I didn't take my cold medication after eating. - What's that one? - It's caffeine. - This is caffeine? - Yes. You know, you may be a terrible father from a normal society's point of view. But here, you have more love than anyone. Well… I am a criminal. Who cares? I'd like to stay longer. But I have Teppei, my kid. Okay. He falls asleep by eight. Eight or nine at the latest. He's not even two yet. He can't sleep if his dad isn't back? No, I'm often not home. In that sense, you may have been a better father than I am. Because I'd be with the kid more if I was a good father. I'm a bad dad. I don't come home, I'm so busy. That can't be helped. We're the bad fathers alliance. Dear uncle Why should we want to live? They say time is medicine. It really is about time to get over the pain from losing someone. The pain can become natural, like something that's always near? Yes. Yes, that's right. It can remain a close presence. It's not about the suicide. It's about the family member who died. The day my sister died I was in intensive care with her the whole day. She jumped in front of a train. Oh, wow. She was cut in half, and it was just her upper body. Her bottom half was in the morgue. - That was the situation? - Yeah. It was just her upper body. They were doing a lot of treatments, and the doctor was asking how we wanted to handle it. With my mom, too. We decided to respect her wishes. She didn't want to live so we left her as is. We asked her to be let go. We were in the ICU for the entire day. At the end, it gradually slows down. Her heartbeat slows down. When we were called in at the end, I said to her, "See you again." When I went to the restroom, it was right before we were called there was a bit of a draft, and I felt like I heard her say, "See you again." The other day, when the phone rang, it was unexpected, so I thought, "Did someone die again?" - When I called, right? - I was startled. - It's always that way, isn't it? - Yeah. I was relieved. I really want people to stop dying. People I know, and close friends. It's okay to not have any answer. Yeah? It's okay not to have an answer to the question you're asking yourself. But as long as you're alive, you keep asking questions. Welcome to the departure. My son
