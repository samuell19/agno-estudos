PANORAMA Studios with participation of GOSKINO OF RF MONTECINEMAVERITA Foundation present a film by Konstantin LOPUSHANSKY Black. All around is so black. The sky is totally black. And I saw a dream... THE TURN OF THE CENTURY Starring: Svetlana SVIRKO Irina SOKOLOVA Roman VIKTYUK Aleksandr BALUYEV Dmitriy SHEVCHENKO Directors of Photography: Nikolai POKOPTSEV Yevgeny GUREVICH Production Designers: Valery YURKEVICH Vladimir YUZHAKOV Music by Val BELIN Producer Ada STAVISKAYA Written and Directed by Konstantin LOPUSHANSKY Have you woken up already? What time is it? It's still early. You don't have to get up yet. Good afternoon. Come in. This way, please. Am I late? No, you're right on time. Sit down, please. Thank you. Want some coffee or tea? No, thanks. Just some water, please. How was the traffic? Bad. The roads are really jammed. Today I read through your mother's medical records again, and your letter, too. Thank you. I appreciate it. That's why I asked you to come here. - Is anything wrong? - No, all is OK. But, you see... I don't know how to say this... This is just general information, bare facts. What I do want to know is your attitude to all this. In other words, I want to know what your mother's major problem is. Why do you want her to take a course of treatment in our clinic? I mean, why do you want her to undergo her mind correction? You must admit, this is a very serious procedure. A very serious intrusion in human mind. I'm talking about this burning of the past procedure. And the rest of the stuff, too. Doctor, I understand you. Please, try to imagine your mother when you talk about her. Okay? Do you feel awkward that I asked you about it? No. I'm fine with it. I know about your methods. Really? Have you been to our clinic before? As a reporter. I was making a program about Stankowsky five years ago. And had a couple of sessions back then. Right. I remember. Well, so much the better for you. Alright, let's start. You have my attention. Excuse me, hold on, please. You know, I really don't know how to say it... She... ...doesn't accept the present time. She thinks all the new life around her, which began recently, is hostile to her. It sounds crazy, but she even refuses to watch TV. She's not an old woman. She's well-educated, speaks foreign languages. She could be doing very well these days. She could live decently, at least, but... That's not what's happening. She is an outcast in this life. Like a stray person, standing on the roadside. Exactly-a stray person standing on the roadside. There're many such people in Russia now. I understand it. But I'm sure the problem lies in the person himself, in his or her psyche. She herself is the problem. Just imagine-she tried to kill herself for a third time in just 2 years. For a third time? How did it happen? Look, honestly, I don't know much about her. We haven't seen much of each other since 1993, you know. Probably, you remember there were these events in Moscow back then, that mini civil war. And we found ourselves on the opposite sides of the barricade, so to speak. She would never forgive me this. The point is that the man whom she had loved all her life got killed in these riots. He died in her arms. And all those on the other side became her worst enemies. - Even you? - Even me. But this is not about politics, you know. And about what, then? Maybe this is all about justice? She got an acute sense of justice, you know. This is odd, but she thinks there is justice on her side of the barricade. All the insulted and humiliated are over there, you know. All those desperate old people. Honestly, I hated her back then, too. So much blood was shed back then. I mean, something is going wrong with people. There's a line, beyond which there's nothing but an abyss and hatred. It doesn't matter who's on the other side - your brother, sister or mother. You feel just hatred that is strangling you. I went through this, too, and I know it takes time to heal from this hatred. But it leaves some traces. Like a scar. Can you guess, what's this? - This is a bullet. - Right. A bullet. It hit my video-camera. I was holding my video-camera close to my face. But they were aiming at me. This is my keepsake of the 1993 events, so to speak. - Excuse me, can I have some water? - Sure. Thank you. All these six years I called her from time to time, by the way. Tried to make it up with her. But she would hang up on me. She got in hospital six months ago, and I flew there right away. I put all my hurt feelings behind me. Doctors saved her. It was a real miracle. She poisoned herself with gas. Thank you. She had changed a lot. I could hardly recognize her. There was something new in her face. Like she had looked beyond the line. Do you understand me? Beyond that line. - I realized I need to save her. - I see your point. I need just to save her. That's all. It was back then that I first thought about placing her in a clinic. If I could change something radically, she would adjust and live on. Or else... You know, this is not my fault. Okay? This is how it all came around. But I can't live with it. I just can't. Try to understand. - When is she coming? - Tomorrow. - Bring her here at once. - Thank you. But I must tell you something. When our patients start having their sessions, it might affect their families, too. They might have emotional outbursts, colorful dreams and images, even fall into unusual states. This is how it works. But nothing serious. Just remember about it, especially while driving. Alright, I'll be careful. - Take care of yourself. - See you later. - I expect to see you tomorrow. - Right. Yes, it's me. Have you bought a ticket yet? Now listen to me. The airport got only one exit. Follow the crowd, and you won't miss it. Right, that's it. Till tomorrow. I look forward to seeing you. Olga! Olga, Olga! Oh my God, Olga! Mom! Oh my God, finally! Mother, dear! - Let's go. Okay? - Yeah. You got your hair cut, right? Yes. You don't like, do you? I think, not bad, huh? Right, not bad. But you have to style it. It's a real mess. - Did you cut it yourself? - Yes. Yesterday. You couldn't wait just for 2 days? I would've taken you to a hairstylist. Do you understand where you are going? Mom, the richest people from across the world come to this clinic. I mean, they're the European elite. Don't worry, I took my black dress with me. You know, this elegant one. You said, a black one? With a bow? Right? Right, with a bow. I got it. Okay, let's go and get you some threads more fit for Europe. Wait. Where are you going? Did I offer you something horrible? Olga, for God's sake, if you are ashamed of me, I can... What? Do you think I'm wasting my money on you? Let's go. Look. They got really nice things here. - Now let's go buy you some shoes. - They are very expensive, I guess. Please, don't say I'm nuts. Okay? I'll ask you to do one thing, and you'll do it. Okay? Say it out-loud and in German, "I'm turning over a new leaf." Cut it out, please. Mom, will you please do it? Alright. - Do you like this picture? - Yes, I do. But you have one, too, don't you? Yes, a very good picture. I have one, too. Okay, all is set. Let's go. Watch your step. It's beautiful. I'm glad you like it. Help yourself. Thank you. As for the sessions, I can tell you about them. It's piece of cake. Kind of x-ray, you know. It helps to see inner images of the psyche, to enhance all positive ones and delete negative ones. This is like a surgery, But on the conscience, not on the body. So this is how this mind correction works. It's like a surgery for appendicitis. Appendicitis must be removed sometime, right? And the sooner, the better. It's not necessary to remove it, you know. Mom, but we've decided it, haven't we? I don't mean this. He writes, quote "There's some mystery. And if you try to look into it, you'll be punished." Unquote. These are his words. That's what he writes. Whose words? Stankowsky's. Have you read his book? "The Quest For Your Own Self". - In Russian? - Yes. It's translated. When was it published? Ages ago? No, recently. You called me, said about this clinic, and I bought it. What does he write about there? About the clinic? No. He writes about patients, who are supposed to get ready for death. You got to be kidding me. I don't know, probably, there are... I mean there were such patients there. But basically all of them are quite sane people with ordinary problems. I got a girlfriend, her name is Gizella. She went to this clinic three years ago. Because of problems with her private life. She was going through a patch of bad luck, you know. But when she was back a week later, I could hardly recognize her. I was looking at a beautiful, thriving woman. She even looked 10 years younger, you know. And what's more-she got so lucky in all, even in minor things. Yes, she got so incredibly lucky. Because she had changed and the world around her had changed, too. Like it was some magic trick. Can you believe this? Her fate changed, too. Come on, let's drink to good luck, so that everything would work out fine. And to our reunion. I got a toast. Don't put down the glass, please. From now on let's never tackle topics which can make us fight. Now let's drink to it. You must promise me. Mom, do you understand what I mean? I promise. Okay, two more hours and we'll be in Poland already. - So quickly? - Yes, this highway is ideal. Why don't you want to make a film about him? About whom? About Stankowsky? Right, and about this clinic in general. About this clinic. Do you want to hear something? But promise you won't tell it to anyone. This is a secret. In short, 5 years ago I came there to make a film about Stankowsky. I was a nervous wreck back then, and was on meds, I abused alcohol and got many other problems, you know. But that's not the point. I mean, I had a lot on my plate back then. You won't believe it now. But back then... Actually, I didn't make any film then. But I added some new problems to my old ones. Jeez. I wouldn't even call it a love affair, if you know what I mean. It lasted just three days. It was sheer madness. It was just crazy. I kind of lost my mind, you know. And not only me. The name of Stankowsky was a kind of password then, verifying that you belong to the intellectual elite of Europe. People went nuts when they just heard his name. This sounds funny, but when people learned about our special relations they came to look at me, like I was a live museum exhibit. You understand me, don't you? That was it. And nothing more. Nothing at all. It was like a dream. But what surprises me most - he didn't even call after I left. Just nothing. I can't believe it. You re just like your granny. She had the same love story, huh? Almost the same. Alright, you'll tell me about it later. I'd like to hear it. Good evening, we've been expecting you. I'll go tell the Doc you're here. Just a minute, please. Are you tired? No, I am not. You can take a rest now. This is the house, where you're gonna live now. Over there? Yes, here we are. Finally. This is the book of regulations for our patients. Read it at once. This is of major importance. I'll come back and pick you up in 30 minutes. Thank you. Bye. And who is this? This is my granny, when she was a small girl. And this woman? This is my mother. She's really young in it. And do you know what surprises me? She looks like my daughter, right? Right, they are amazingly alike. Right. Do you happen to have any pictures, in which she is older? No, I don't. She drowned when I was just 10. So... This is you when you were a small girl and a young lady. This is me when I went to college. This is Andrei. This is you and Andrei. This is Andrei. - This is Andrei. - Right. Andrei. This is your granny and mother. This is Olga when she was a small girl. This is Olga... This is you. - This is Olga and you. - Right. We must sort them out. According to the characters. Are you fine with the word "characters"? According to Doctor Stankowsky, our life is nothing but a play. To understand it better we must see all the characters playing in it. But we'll talk about it later. And now, let's talk about that sad day when you had that break-down. I'm more interested in the details of that day than in the event itself. Like your thoughts, accidental associations and meetings. - Meetings? - Yes, accidental meetings. And strangers, too. They're all characters of that day. And they play an important role. I understand. But it wasn't an attempt at suicide. Sure. I know. That's why I used the term "nervous break-down". Start from morning. What happened in the morning? In the morning... Yes, I remember. I was to get... I was to get some certificate. And suddenly it struck me - they are eliminating us. Do you understand? They are killing us. They seek our death. No one cares about us. We are not wanted here. We're redundant. We just create problems for them. This is a kind of vicious circle. We got no money. We got no hope. We got nothing. It's hardly possible to survive. And I... I even didn't have any money to buy bread that day. I had no money at all. I ran out of totally everything. And I realized there was no way, that was the end. I wouldn't live through it. And what's more - no one feels sorry for anybody. That's it. I have a bottle of salmiac in my purse. I found it. Get some water. Call 9-1-1. Look, a bum. Hey, here. Take the bottle, old bag. Then I was at home. I didn't go anywhere that day, though I had so many things to do. But I stayed at home. I was so exhausted. I wanted to make some coffee. But it boiled out. I needed to get up and turn off the gas cooker. I was so weak, I couldn't even get up. I remember this very clearly. Then... I started thinking about time. I started listening to how it was moving. I mean... ...how it was standing still. It seemed to me time had stopped. And then you recalled that day, October, 1993. And you saw it very graphically, right? Right. No. No, I don't want it. It has never been. No, no. Please, stay here, don't go after me! Bastards! SOBs! Wait! Please, stop it! I'm begging you! Oh my God, what's wrong with her? Put her on the couch and give her a sedative. Let her sleep. Come on. Can't you see it yourself? All this trash, all these despicable bastards have climbed career ladders and are holding high posts now. They've all won. I mean all these thieves, all this mafia. Half of them are former party bosses, by the way. And all of them are thriving now. This is their time. By the way, the most unscrupulous and scummy bastards are the luckiest ones now. They belong now.. And time feels who belongs here now and helps their own. And scrupulous and decent people are just doomed. This is not their time. They don't belong here now. And another thing is vulgarity. It's on every corner and in everything. This vulgarity is inexplicable and total. Like all have gone nuts overnight. Like we never had our great culture and got nothing to look up to as a model. How are we to deal with all this? And this vulgarity is not just an art, it's a certain way of thinking. It's a certain lifestyle. You mean, the old evil was better, huh? No, I don't say that the old evil was better. I fought it, too. Like many people of my generation did, you know.. But there's some mystery here. We destroyed the old evil, but a new one grew in its place. And some evil it is! That's why I say that the time itself is really scummy and treacherous. It betrayed the people in their most sacred expectations. Do you remember this line from the "Revelation"? The spirit of substitution is the spirit. of antichrist. It rings true to me. Substitution. We got a substitution here. But why? I think... ...this is our own fault. This is... like a scratched record. It is rotating and with every rotation it produces this hissing noise. I mean, it has good music recorded on it, but you can't listen to it. We are like this scratched record. We got this scratch deep in our souls and genes. God knows who left it there. But the one who left it spoiled all the music. I don't know. It's all very long. No one will watch it. Besides, it's so pessimistic. You know what? Let's take just 2 or 3 phrases and sequence them together with a casino or body-art party picture. And I can add some sound-track. And it will work, I guess. Sounds good to me. We'll play some sound-track. Olga, may I steal you for a minute? He came in the afternoon and gave me a real hard time because of this film. I got it. Thank you. Yes? I'm listening. Can you explain what's going on here? Why do you cut out the best sequences and put in some trash? You're making bad shows on purpose. But why? So you say this is trash, right? Right, trash. And you know it, too. Alright, I'll explain it to you. So this is trash, right? I agree, this is trash. But it brings in money. The world has changed. People want to have fun. They don't like to philosophize. This is life. Okay? Do I need to explain it to you? So that's how you look upon it. Sounds interesting. And you? You think it should be kinda trash, kinda commercial and kinda intellectual? All three in one? So that all know you are a smart ass, and just forced to earn money. Good for you. It's really tough to talk to you today. Alright, what's wrong with this film, then? All is wrong. It is about a person from the past. And our show is about new people in Russia. Yes, they are vulgar. Yes, they're stupid. Yes, they are mafia. But future belongs to them. And your damned philosopher will die of hunger tomorrow. I remember when we dropped by, he couldn't offer us a cup of tea. His fridge was empty. There was just a piece of stale bread there. - Look, what do you know about Russia? - Who? Me? Right, you. Western intellectuals. You think all people are Dostoyevskys in Russia. Wrong. We got no more Dostoyevskys here. We got hitmen, hookers and mafia now. And bankers, who used to be rats. That's it. But there are no more Dostoyevskys They are extinct. Okay? You know what? Olga, if you don't stop it... ...if you keep doing it in the future, I'll quit working with you. And I'm not kidding. Marcus, wait. I'm tired. I'm really tired. We congratulate you all on the coming of the new millennium. Thank you. What's your name? Alexander. Don't be scared of anything. All is fine. We'll just have to increase the doze. A bit. It is black. I see a house. My mom is inside it. Yes. She gets inside the house. It's pitch dark in there. I'm scared to follow her. There's... death there. Death. Come on, there's no death there. Wrong. It is there. I know it. All this is Death. Totally all is death. Shadows. They are shadows. But they are like alive. Their faces... Like... ...I knew them before. As though they want to show me something. I got it. They told me about it - I am to see something in there. It is very crucial. Again. They show it to me again. I'm supposed to understand something. It is very important. But what? What? I don't know. What? I got it. They meant this. Yes. All play other parts now. After I died, I heard the words, "All play other parts now." This is my dream. Like we all live underwater. I often had this dream. There are fish, swimming in the window. I remember it. Will you, please, focus on it? Look harder. Yes, yes, I see shadows... Please, calm down. She feels it, too. Yes, I understand. They are... ...having fun there. I can hear music. And I can see. Yes, this is Andrei. He is a student at the Institute of Literature now. He passed his exams successfully. He is very young. He's very, very young. Just a boy... Let's go. - Where? - I must tell you something. - I got a surprise for you. - What surprise? Want to know? Close your eyes then. - Why? - Just close them. Alright. Guys, we are strong enough To protect our home planet from a new war. We are for peace, for friendship, for smiles of our sweethearts, And for good hearty meetings... And now give a big hand to Ivan Aleksandrovich Koshkin, one of our most prominent translators of American literature. I left out one very important fact from his biography- he graduated from this very institute in 1924. I need to cram for my exam. What? This is Voznesensky. I'll ask him to sign his book of poems for me. - Okay. I'll be there. - Good luck. Do come to Moscow some day, And take a walk along Arbat Street. On Tverskaya Street plunge Into the whispering green alleys. You should see at least once How girls are dancing In the palms of the big Blue squares. The song is rolling on... Incredible! Come on, look. What is it? Do you see it? This is a costumed ball. A ball in the clinic? Henric Stankowsky is throwing a farewell party. And as usual, at night. - You are to go there, right? - Don't worry. I still have time. If you want, we can go together. We're invited. No, go without me. I'll stay here. I love the sea. Very much. Me, too. Look, don't be mad at me for bringing this subject up again. Just try to think about it calmly. Why can't you live together with me in Germany? Don't start. Let's drop it. Okay? Don't. I can't do it. No, no. I neither can nor want it. No, this won't work. And what about you? What? Why don't you go back to Russia? I'll never ever go back to Russia. I got it. What's happened? Nothing. Life is passing by. That's it. Don't you feel it? I keep thinking all the time - why did flowers and leaves have really strong smell when we were kids? Why can't I feel it now? She didn't say a word about my father, you know. She remembers just him, Andrei. Just one love and one life. Like with my granny. Sleep. Olga, my sweetie, come in. You've got frozen, haven't you? Take off your jacket. Quick. I'll introduce you to someone now. Come on in. Here you are. This is Andrei Vasilyevich. From now on he'll be living here, with us. Come on, meet him. I'm Andrei Vasilyevich. You may call me just Uncle Andrei. Why you got so embarrassed? I'll never let you go, do you hear me? Never. I knew we're destined be together. I swear. Every night I prayed for it in the camp. I'll stand through any ordeal. - I'll stand through any ordeal. - No, I'll stand through any ordeal. I love you. I do. I love you more than anything in the world. When you're by my side, I fear nothing. Because I love you. We'll be together. I love you. Yes, I do. I do. I love you madly. - I love you... - Please, don't talk. Andrei, darling, I will never let you go. You'll stay with me, okay? I will never let you go. That's it. I've been waiting for you so long. I've been waiting for you all this time. I've been waiting for you, too. I knew I'd come back. - And now we're finally reunited. - Thank you. I'm so happy we are together now. And we'll be together till we die. I fear nothing now. I love you more than my own life! I love you, too. Madly. Andrei, darling, I love you so much! Hello? Hello, is this Olga Lezhneva? Hello, is that you, Doctor Libner? - Did I wake you up? - Nope. The point is we got some problems. What happened? It would be better... Can you come here? Sure. I'll be right there. Yes, thank you. Do you want me to go with you? No. - What's wrong, Doctor? - I'll explain it to you now. But stay calm, please. Alright, alright. I see you calmed down. And now let's try to analyze what we got here. I don't want to analyze it. Period. Of course. It's really hard to burn all images at once. I understand it. These are not just images. This is my life. No, this is not life. These are just some phantoms. Trust me. Images of our conscience. And nothing more. Look, I can't burn anything. Exactly my words. We don't have to burn them at once. Let's analyze them. Let's pick, say, October 1993 events. Do you remember them? - Yes, I do. - Good. And now tell me-why do you need to remember this nightmare? Why store this dreadful stuff, all this blood and horror in your memory? What's wrong about it? We all can forget some things. You can forget them, too. I can't forget them. Period. This is my life. Do you understand this is my life? Okay, this is your life. But this is a horrible scene. Why remember it? Leave me alone. What do you all want from me? Why all this ordeal? Leave me alone. Get out of here! Please. Olga, Olga... Mother, dear, please, calm down. I beg you - calm down. Relax. Don't cry. Please, forgive me. I'm so stupid. I'm just a hysterical woman. I'm sorry, Olga. Please, forgive me. I understand. These sessions cost you a lot of money. But I can't burn all this. Do you understand me? Yes, I do. - This is mine. - Right. This is yours. Maybe it is bad and horrible. But this is all mine. This is my life, Olga. This is our life. I'm nothing and nobody without it. I'm just an empty shell. Olga, dear, I just can't do it. I'm sorry, Olga. I'm so sorry. Forgive me. Please. Doctor, I really appreciate what you've done for my mom. But I haven't done anything yet. You understand what I mean, right? I don't know how to explain it to you. But she is not going to burn anything. That's not the reason why she is here. Sorry, you lost me. What do you mean "that's not the reason"? Just what I said. But let us not talk about it. It doesn't matter now. Olga, do you understand yourself what you are saying? That's just a temporary weakness. And you're cutting her some slack. And the aftermath will last much longer. Probably, for decades. If she lives that long, of course. We're not talking about some progress here. Progress? What progress? Who knows what is better and what is worse? What do we know after all? Well... Now you're talking like Professor Stankowsky. I hope you won't say that life was granted to us by God. Or that sufferings purify us. I like this idea, too. "They purify us". I really dig these words. Olga, I'm surprised to hear this blasphemy from a woman with such a brilliant career. Cut it out, please. We are not talking about me now. Please, stop it. But I disclaim all responsibility for the consequences in this case. And I mean your mother's possible suicide. I'm sorry, but your mother is definitely a suicidal woman. I'm sorry, but that's true. You know, half of this nation are suicidal. So what? But we should do something about it. We may try something different. Of course, it will take time and is worth extra money. Time, money. I don't have either of them now. I did all I could for her. If she doesn't want it I can't force her. What do you want from me then? I got my own life to live. I got my commitments, contracts, work. I got a lot on my plate, too. And I can't just throw it down the drain! I can't! Do you understand me? I can't! I can't! I can't! Sure. You're right, I'm sure. I'm sorry. You've done a lot for her. I'm really sorry. I'll be right back. I'm here to say 'good-bye' to you. Yesterday you were swamped and didn't notice me. What's wrong with you? Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Are you leaving right away? Yes. Why? My mother's flight is in 2 hours. But you can't drive now. Why? We're in the middle of a strong magnetic storm now. And your reaction might be impaired. In case you think I'm lying, listen to the radio. Oh, you are saying you are kind of worried about me, right? Sorry, I don't understand what you're talking about. Never mind. Have it your own way. That's so typical of you. One minute you act like you're so worried and care a lot, and the next - "have it your own way". And go to hell. You said it. I didn't. But you thought it. You know, you're cruel, Henric. You're really very cruel. You haven't called me all these years. No, you wouldn't descend from your cold Olympus. I understand - you surrounded yourself with geniuses. And who am I? God knows who and God knows why. By the way, your good taste betrayed you. Such a dramatic scene in the finale. The Patriarch leaves. The final monologue. That's too much. Too suggestive. You must admit, it's too pretentious. Stop playing the fool, Olga. You are wrong about it. But if you want to know the truth... I'm quitting my job in the clinic because... - Why? - Never mind. Forget it. Why? I'd like to hear it. It's very interesting. You're quitting the clinic because you've had no serious patients recently. Just a bunch of nut-cases, right? Why do you think so? I did my homework. Don't forget I'm a reporter. And I got a hunch. Serious patients don't come here. They go to be treated by Doctor Libner. Doctor Libner is a star of the European caliber. A rising star. Do you understand what I mean? He's a new and young star. Okay. The board of directors kicks you out. Buy they are doing it politely-they're throwing a party to honor you. Go on, I'm listening to you. And do you know why? Why? Because the worst possible thing happened to you. And what's the worst thing for for any human? It's old age. Nothing can beat it. You got outdated, Henric. All your great ideas, all your theories and concepts are just scientific junk, trash, waste paper. Nobody needs them now. Truth can't get outdated. I'm not talking about truth. You said yourself there're no truths in science. There're just different points of view. And by definition points of view get outdated. Who said it? You? If I sought followers, I'd have chosen you. You mean I catch it on the fly? Yes, you're quick to learn. I didn't expect it. If you approve of me, I'll tell you one more thing. Sometimes I imagine how in the morning you look at yourself in the mirror. You see fat on your sides, cellulites. "Cellulites". What a horrible word. And this smell. The smell of the aging body. How I hate it. I hate old age, you know. Why are you telling me all this? I don't know why. Why? Probably, because we're supposed to speak our minds in this clinic. No, I'm wrong. Why? Why? Why? Henric, I took my medical records, by the way. I don't want anybody to poke their noses in them after you are gone. Okay, time to say good-bye. I don't say "See you later". We'll never meet again, I guess. Jeez, I sound so pompous. Sorry. Remember me, please... Henric. What's wrong? No big deal. Just some dust got in my eyes. Why all this rush? You still have loads of time. Let's have some coffee. Okay? No. Oh my, I almost forgot it. Here. This is the money. Just for starters. Then I'll be sending it to you. What money? Why? I won't take it. But how are you going to live? Do you think I don't know? What do you know? You got no job, you don't get your pension, they don't publish you. What are you gonna do? Pick up discarded bottles? Don't worry. I'll survive. Better pick up bottles. Why are you giving me this hard time? Take the money, I said. Olga, let's drop this subject. I won't take this money. No way. What do you mean by "this money"? Explain it to me, please. Be so kind and explain to me what you mean by "this money"? Olga, dear, we're going to be late. Trust me. It will be better this way. Wait. Why did you say "this money"? Explain it to me. - You want me to explain it to you? - Yes. - Alright. - Please. - How did you get this money? - What do you mean "how"? Why did they give you this money? I got it for my work, for my show. What are you talking about? You got it for corrupting people's minds with your dirty stories, for slandering everything and everybody, for flinging mud at everything, that used to be the best in your country. What the hell are you talking about? Just listen to yourself. You think I don't know about it? I saw it this morning. The doctor said, "Look, this is your daughter, on a popular show." I was so ashamed I was ready to run away and hide. My God, you'd better be a hooker. What? What are you talking about? I'm ashamed you're my daughter. You're at it again. I thought I'd never hear this crap. No. The same old story. Okay, let's hold a rally here and sing the Internationale. You red-brown freaks. That's what you are. We are freaks? We're red-brown? The Internationale is red-brown? What do you know about all this? It's you who've ruined our lives, you really tramped on our feelings, you didn't care a shit about them. Nothing is sacred for you - neither faith, nor hope, nor love. You've won. You're winners, right? But remember - he who doesn't respect is not respected. And your kids will do the same to you. You'll get your payback. Because we are young and we are not like you? Is it our fault? Yes, we are different. And we'll never ever be like you. Okay? And we'll terminate your red-brown plague. We'll do away with it.
