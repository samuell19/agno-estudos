Mikael, will you appeal? Yes. l'll appeal to you, Viggo. [REPORTERS CLAMORlNG] WOMAN 1 [ON TV]: Up until today, Mr. Blomkvist was able to play the victim, the brave journalist going up against the bad guy. MAN 1: l don't know why malicious intent couldn't be proven. When you call a guy a criminal-- MAN 2: lf you want to say these things-- WOMAN 2: Mikael Blomkvist likes publicity. MAN 3: There's really no greater disgrace for a journalist than libel. REPORTER [ON TV]: --was found guilty today on 16 counts of aggravated libel. Can l get that sandwich there? And a black coffee. ln an article published earlier this year, Blomkvist claimed, Wennerström, founder and president of the Wennerström Group, used state funds intended for industrial development in Poland in an arms deal with the right-wing Ustaše in Croatia. I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist. He's a fine journalist, who l don't believe is guided by malice. But what he wrote was inaccurate. And inaccuracies can't go unanswered. All journalists have to accept, like the rest of us, actions have consequences. REPORTER: Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600,000 Swedish kronor in damages and all court costs.

You mean he's hygienic? He's who he presents himself to be. ln his business, that's an asset. Well, there's less in his asset column after his conviction today. True. He made a fool of himself. lf it happened that way. Are you suggesting that he was set up? That was never part of my assignment. But you're right. He did make a fool of himself professionally. How much of a fool did he make of himself financially? The judgment will just about empty his savings. May l go? FRODE: Moment. Your report is light in another area. His personal life. Anything you chose not to disclose? Nothing that warranted inclusion. Does that mean yes or no? l think what Miss Salander means, and l agree, is that everyone has a right to a certain amount of privacy, even if they're being investigated. FRODE: Not in this case. l need to know anything about him l might find unsavory, even if she doesn't. He's had a longstanding sexual relationship with his co-editor of the magazine. lt wrecked his marriage but not hers. Sometimes he performs cunnilingus. Not often enough, in my opinion.

You used to run one of the largest industrial firms in the country. "Used to." That's correct. Oh, l didn't mean that. Should l stay? No. My grandfather forged the tracks that the 4:30 train will take you home on. We stitched this country together. We made the steel, milled the lumber that built modern Sweden.

This is not enough. ♪ Only one thing left to do I can hurt someone like you ♪ ♪ Tear you out For all to see these lies ♪♪ No, thank you. VANGER: This is Harriet. The granddaughter of my brother Richard. Richard was a Nazi of the first order, joining the Nationalist Socialist Freedom League when he was 17. lsn't it interesting how fascists always steal the word "freedom"? Heh, heh. [CLOCK CHlMlNG] Oh, the 4:30. Yes, l know. Okay. Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi cause in 1940. Missed all the real excitement. But not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife, Margareta, and their son, Gottfried. Now, Gottfried, Harriet's father, was what they used to call a good-time Charlie. They still call them that. Do they? Okay. He was a charmer, a ladies' man and a drunk. ln other words, a born salesman. Which he did for the company, traveling around and taking clients out to dinner. Well, somebody's gotta do it. That's right. Anyway, ahem, he died in 1965. Drowned, drunk, here on the island. His wife, lsabella, who had been pretty much useless as a parent before, became even more so after his death, which is when l began looking after the children. Martin, who runs Vanger lndustries, now that l'm retired. That's right, l Googled him. VANGER: And Harriet. Ah. She was bright, curious, a winning combination in any person. And beautiful. Yeah. Something happened to her? Someone in the family murdered Harriet, and for the past 40 years, has been trying to drive me insane. [♪♪♪] VANGER: lt was September 24th, 1966. A Saturday. Harriet was 16. My brothers and their wives and their children and grandchildren were all gathered here for our loathsome annual board meeting and dinner. It was also the day the yacht club held their autumn parade. Harriet, with one or two school friends, went into town to see it. She returned a little after 2:00. She came into the parlor. She asked if she could talk to me. l honestly don't remember what l was doing that l thought was more important, but l told her to give me a few minutes. lt was during those few minutes that something else occurred. The accident had nothing to do with Harriet, and yet everything. Heh. lt was chaos as everybody put down what they were doing. Police, ambulance, fire brigade, reporters, photographers, onlookers all quickly arrived from town just as we on the island, the family, hurried to the bridge from our side. The driver of the car, a man named Aronsson, was pinned and severely injured. We tried desperately to pry him loose with our hands since metal tools might spark. [lNDlSTlNCT SHOUTlNG] lt was an hour after the crash that Harriet was in the kitchen. Anna herself saw her. Well, we finally got poor Aronsson out of his car and off to the hospital. Just as we from our side slowly drifted back to the house. The sun was down, the excitement over. We sat down to dinner. lt was then that l noticed Harriet wasn't there. And she wasn't there the next morning. Or the next. Or the next 40 years. What was she going to tell me? Why didn't l make time for her? Why didn't l listen? And she couldn't have just run away? No. Not without being seen. The firemen stayed out all night on the bridge pumping up gasoline. No one swam across or took a boat. All the boats were still tied up on this side Sunday. Believe me, l checked. MlKAEL: She couldn't have just fallen and drowned? No. The currents aren't strong here. Anything that falls in the water turns up. Like her father. His body didn't drift more than 10 meters when he drowned the year before. Oh, no. Someone killed her. Someone on the island that day. Someone close enough to know what she used to give me each year on my birthday. Those are from her. And the rest, from her killer. Who knows about these? There's me, the police, the killer, and now you. VANGER: After the police investigation evaporated, I kept at it, studying all the information there was. l have spent half my life examining the events of a single day. l understand your frustration, but what you're asking me to do, it's a waste of money. But we haven't discussed your fee. We don't need to. Thank you. l can't find something you've been unable to find in 40 years. You don't know that. You have a very keen investigative mind. Here's what l propose: You come stay on the island. l have a nice little cottage by the water you can use. You study the material l send you. You find something l've missed or you don't. What you're asking me to do is set aside my life and career for-- Think of this as a well-deserved holiday. A way of avoiding all those people that you might want to avoid right now. As for compensation, l'll pay you double your salary for as many months as it takes. Quadruple it if you solve the mystery. Herr Vanger-- l'm not done. l will throw in one more thing, even though you're a terrible negotiator. lt's something you want more than anything else, and it can't be bought at any price. So let me give it to you. Hans-Erik Wennerström. He began his career working for me, and l have followed it with interest, shall we say, ever since. [♪♪♪] You were right about him. You just couldn't prove it. [DEVlCE BEEPS] We're in the middle of the worst crisis ever, and you're writing a memoir. You fired me. l need something to do. You fired you. l need you here, not the North Pole. Mikael, you know what this is going to look like. Like l've been gutted. l'm running away. l am. Wennerström wants to see me wave a white flag, not a red flag. lf it looks like there's a problem between us, it'll satisfy him. There is a problem between us. He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down. You're leaving me to fight him alone. lt's four hours by train. lt's not the North Pole.

Oh, yes, he's quite detestable, to put it nicely. But you'll probably never see him. He's a recluse. He was there that day? lndeed, he was. His daughter, Cecilia, lives over there. They don't speak. Does anybody speak to anybody on this island? Ha, ha. Actually, lsabella, Harriet's mother, who lives there, she speaks to Harald, which is one of the reasons l don't speak to her. Right. Cecilia's brother, Birger, lives over there. MlKAEL: Who doesn't he speak to? VANGER: You, probably. But you wouldn't want him to. He can be just as unpleasant as Harald. Quickly losing track of who's who here. Ho-ho-ho. How you'll wish it were always so. Soon you will know us all only too well, with my apologies. Now, out there, my grandnephew Martin's house, Harriet's brother. Who speaks to him? l speak to him. He runs the company now, as l think l told you. [GUNSHOT] Oh. Someone's shooting his dinner. Gunnar, probably. Oh, yes, l met him earlier. He was 19 when Harriet disappeared. Well, he lives over there. And you live there. Sorry? Your house. Oh. Ha. Oh, yes. Yes, you're right.

[SPEAKlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY] VANGER: But what about the search? Please. Please. l beg you. [SHOUTS lNDlSTlNCTLY] MORELL: The fact that l never found a body was not surprising. You can't dig up an entire island. But neither could l find the motive. Was it spontaneous? Was it calculated? Did she know something someone wished she didn't? Was it about business? Business? Well, she was 16. And very bright. Henrik told me and many others he could easily see her running the company one day. She was with some friends that day at a parade. She told them she was feeling unwell. She left early. But they also told me she kept secrets from them too. The main thing l learned was that teenage girls are complicated. l have one. Oh, then you know. l wanted to, uh, ahem, ask you about this. She received that from Henrik the Christmas before. l've studied it more times than l can say. l know every page of it. lt's the last page l was curious about. As was l. lt's a list of names, numbers and it must have some significance. All local phone numbers. The first belonged to a woman, Margot, whose mother was Magda, who denied knowing Harriet. The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosmarie Larsson, an elderly woman who died some years before. The other three were not connected in any way that l could find. l reminded you of things you'd rather forget, and l'm sorry. l can't forget. lt's my Rebecka case. Uh, l don't know what that is. Every policeman has at least one unsolved case to obsess over. Back then we had an Officer Torstensson. Year after year, he kept going back to this Rebecka case. Taking out the files, studying them over and over. We were young. We laughed at him. And that was also a missing-girl case? No, no, no, that's not why l mention it. l'm talking about the soul of a policeman. MORELL: Poor old Torstensson never solved it. And he never let it go. [TRAlN HORN BLARlNG] MAN: So how's Mr. Palmgren doing? l heard he had a stroke of some kind? Huh? lt's terrible. Now, what exactly do you do at this security company? Make coffee, sort mail. But not full-time. Not even part-time consistently. They somehow got along without coffee or mail in July and August? How much do you make there? Enough. How much is your rent? l pay my rent. And when was the last time you were late? Never. You think that thing through your eyebrow makes you attractive? Here's the problem. There's a discrepancy between the obligation of Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and the management of your finances. There's no discrepancy. lt was clear l could manage my own finances. That is not clear to me. l'm not a child. You are not. But you were. And between then and now, you were committed to the locked ward of St. Stefan's where you continued to display violent aggression. And you failed to adapt to four foster homes, arrested twice for intoxication, twice for narcotics, again for assault, smashing a bottle into a man's face. And it's not even that long ago. You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into thinking that you have changed, but when l'm looking at this, not to mention the way you're looking at me now, l don't think you have. So the good old Mr. Palmgren days are over. Starting now, you will be given a monthly allowance. You'll provide me with receipts for your expenses. lf the numbers don't balance, l assume the difference is going to drugs. l've taken care of myself since l was 10. The state has taken care of you. Miss Salander, please, look at me, this is important.

Together they are the old Sweden and the new. Yes, they are. You know about Harriet, right? You don't? Yes, l do. The family doesn't want to talk about it, but it can't be swept under the rug. What can't? Harriet. We can talk about it later. Uh... We can talk about it now. Liv knows everything about my crazy family. That's why she'll never marry me. That's one reason. MARTlN: l don't want to read about that in the book. Everything else is fine. Harriet certainly. You know, everything changed after that. Not just the family, but the company as well. How so? We're not Ericsson or Nordea. But we're still the largest family-owned company in the country. At our height we had 40,000 employees. We have half of that now. And that downward slide began after my sister's death. [♪♪♪] lt broke Henrik's entrepreneurial spirit and his heart. Uh-- You were here that day? MARTlN: l came in later, after the accident on the bridge, with the 4:30 train. l know it well. A terrible day. [SlGHS] And the days after, you know? Searching, not finding. Even worse. This event, Mikael, it has to have a big part in your book. [MARTlN SPEAKS lN SWEDlSH] l got a call from social welfare. l've been assigned a new guardian. [♪♪♪] Hi. Hello. l thought l'd come over and say hello. l'm Cecilia. Oh, yes. Please, come in. Can l get you some coffee? No, thank you. We are all uncomfortable with the idea of a chronicle of our family. lt's not about the family. lt's about Henrik and the company. Like l said. lt's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone. CEClLlA: Unlike the one that landed you in court. Unlike that one, yes. So you're not really here to find out what happened to Harriet. l can't ignore such a dramatic event, but, no, that's by no means my focus. Those boxes that Gunnar carted down here, which are where, in the closet now? Those weren't Henrik's investigation? l wonder sometimes who's crazier, my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle. Since we're talking about her, since you brought her up, what was she like? What was Harriet like? l'm sure Henrik has told you. He was my age back then. He couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager. You were the same age. My sister Anita was closer to her in age. She knew Harriet better than anyone. You should talk to her. l'd love to. Where is she? lf l had to guess, London. You don't know where your sister lives? l haven't seen her in years. We never really got along. l'm getting used to that comment. She hates this place more than l do. She left. Moved to London, that was it. You couldn't pay her to send a Christmas card, much less visit. l'll track her down for you. lf you do, and try talking to her about us, don't be surprised if she tells you to fuck off.

Actually, it's a lot more than that. Haven't seen my sister, haven't seen anyone in that family. Most of what l'm writing about predates that, so your recollections are valid. l wouldn't know where to start, if that was a question. Well, then let me narrow it down. l've gotten up to the 1960s, to the event that, you know, changed everything in Henrik's life. Harriet. Um, everything that l know about that, l told to whatever his name was. Morell. My recollections were a lot better then. l'm not really speaking about the event itself. l just want to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like. She was very messed up. Well, just like all us Vanger kids, really, but... Crazy mother. Drunken father. At least her father wasn't a Nazi. Was he abusive? Mine? No, hers. Not that l ever saw, but you could tell that something was going on. Some days she'd be very withdrawn. And then the next minute she'd be putting on makeup and wearing the tightest sweater that she had to school. And then she'd be studying her Bible like a nun. No Vanger was ever religious. Can you imagine? She was obviously very unhappy. What do you think happened to her? Everyone knows what. You don't have any thoughts about who or why? All that l know is that l felt really sorry for her. l got away when l was 18 and l never went back. And she'd have done the same. But she never made it to 18.

How long do you think you can hang on? Six months? That sounds about right. VANGER: l used to be in the newspaper business. We owned six dailies back in the '50s. We still own one. The Courier, here in town. Which l let my nephew, Birger, run, because he can't run anything else. So, what would you say to taking on a partner? Well, we've never had to consider it before. We value our independence very much. lndependence in publishing is dependent on advertisers. However much you have, you retain. We don't care about content. Excuse me. Did l miss something? Talking about investing in the magazine. l gathered that. But why? Not out of greed, that's for sure. l feel badly that l've taken Mikael away from you at the worst possible time. But now l am convinced that this is the right thing to do. The moral thing. That's one reason. And, um... And...? The enemies of my friends are my enemies. MlKAEL: How long have you been discussing this with them? l haven't. They called yesterday and asked me to come up. Why didn't you tell me? You live in the woods. l deserve to be treated like an idiot? l wanted to hear what they had to say. You would've said no before they could. Well, l'm saying it now. lt's a bad idea. You heard me tell them we had six months. l lied. We will be out of business in three. But you don't know this family like l do. They're crazy. We're not marrying into it. lf we do this, that's exactly what we're doing. So you wanna say no, let's say no. lnstead of 50 percent of something, let's own 100 percent of nothing. Mikael?

REPORTER: Are you referring to Mr. Wennerström? l'm referring to anyone who tries to sue his enemies into submission. lf Herr Wennerström would like to try it again, he will find himself fighting a company that can afford to fight back.

You know that Rebecka case you mentioned. Would you recall her last name? Of course l do. But what has that to do with anything? Nothing, probably. Jacobsson. Rebecka Jacobsson. And how was she killed? She was decapitated. Her arms were cut off and she was burned. But all that happened in the 1940s. [SlREN WAlLlNG] What have you found? l have to call you back. Why--? [SlREN WAlLlNG] ls it Henrik? Yeah, we were talking. He rubbed his arm, then he collapsed. Think he's gonna be okay? l honestly don't know. You go. Talk to you later. l'm sorry.

You want a sandwich? Small Scotch. Uh, sure. Thank you. Um, l hate to be indelicate, but Henrik promised me something when l agreed to do this. Yeah, Wennerström. l need to know what he has on him. Now. ln case, um-- ln case he dies? Well, that is indelicate. And l apologize. l don't know what he has on him, if you're asking me. And he can't tell you in the condition he's in, so... We also didn't discuss who l'd report to if something should happen to him. Oh, well, you'd report to me, of course. But we both know that nothing's going to come of this, don't we? No. No, we don't know that. What do you mean? l may have found something. You're joking. What have you found? The last time l reported on something without being absolutely sure, l lost my life savings. l need a research assistant. Can you authorize that? Yes. Do you have one in mind? l can find someone. l know an excellent one. She did the background check on you. The what? Well, you don't think we can hire just anyone without doing a background check. l want to read that. Herr Frode was kind enough to share your report with me. The investigator's name. That is her name, yes? See, l can't find any record of her, and l'm pretty good at that. Would it matter what her name is? lf l wanted to speak to her, yes. lt's against policy. You sure? Just like your sources. You understand. Okay. Ahem. Here's a name for you. My sister. She's also my lawyer. She'll be contacting you. There are things in here that can only have come from one place.

That won't be necessary. Your report, very detailed. But for me, it wasn't very entertaining. lt wasn't meant to be. When l write about people, l try to entertain the reader. Wennerström wasn't entertained much. Uh, your boss, Armansky, yeah, he tells me you only do jobs that interest you, so l suppose l should be flattered. You gonna sit down? He also says that you're the one he goes to when the job is, um, sensitive. That's the word he used, "sensitive." l'm gonna use "illegal," because that's what it was when you hacked into my computer. No, l'm not gonna do anything about that. l could, but l won't. What l'm gonna do is l'm gonna tell you a story, and if it entertains you, maybe you'll decide to help me research further. And if not, l'll do the washing up and you'll never see me again. Here, you should eat that. What kind of research? Lisbeth-- Oh, can l call you Lisbeth? l want you to help me catch a killer of women. l've got R.J. Rebecka Jacobsson. l've got absolutely no idea who the rest of these are or how they're connected to the death of a 16-year-old girl, but they must be somehow. What we've gotta do is find out who they are, what happened to them, and what these Leviticus verses have to do with anything. What are you doing? Getting started. You can keep talking if you want. Don't you need to look over these? l got it. [♪♪♪] Cat! [CAT PURRlNG] How'd you get in? MAN: No one has asked me about Magda in over 40 years. Why would a lady like you want to know about an awful murder? lt interests me. Does it? lSAKSSON: Her husband was the first suspect. The husband is always the first suspect and usually the last. But not this time. We moved on to a neighbor. Then a vagrant. Once you get to strangers, it's only a matter of time before you get to gypsies and you know you're never going to solve it. How exactly was she killed? Miss...? Salander. Miss Salander. l hope you don't mind me asking, but when did you last eat? l have a high metabolism. l can't put on weight. l'm asking because it is better to look at what l am about to show you on an empty stomach. HARRlET: lf a man's offering is a lamb, it shall be a female without blemish. He should lay his hand upon its head, slaughter it, empty its blood on the base of the altar, and he shall be forgiven. How is he? He needs surgery, but there's no DNR in place. So it's up to the family to decide, should the occasion arise, whether to resuscitate or not. And they're not good at decisions. So how was it with Miss Salander? She said yes. Do you think l might be able to see him? He was asleep the last time l looked, but let me check. Thank you. Don't check. Tell him to pack his things and leave. Mother, please. Don't use that tone with me. lsabella, Mr. Blomkvist works for Henrik. We should put this to a vote. MARTlN: Don't be an idiot, Birger. We all know what Henrik wants. Can we just do that? Henrik is fighting for his life in there. This is the last thing he needs. Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger, there is no smoking in here. lSABELLA: Go back to Stockholm. When we need a family chronicle written by a libelist, we know who to call. All right. Thanks. This way, miss.

That's why the company's such a mess. l apologize for my mother's behavior. l'm used to it. lt has nothing to do with you. lt's between her and Henrik. She lost it when my father died, and her drinking and her... Got so bad Henrik took me and my sister away from her and left her excommunicated in the old house on the other side of the island. She hasn't forgiven him. You must stay. You're the last chance Henrik has at some kind of resolution. Put this to rest one way or another. l'll keep my mother away. But please, hurry. Of course. Lisbeth. l'll get that. lt's okay. Martin Vanger. How do you do? Fine. [CHUCKLES] lt's a girlfriend, or...? Assistant. Oh. Thank you so much. Good night. Good night. Problems finding the place? Everyone in town knows who and where you are. That's comforting. Are you hungry? l can make you a sandwich. No. [CLEARS THROAT] l used to have a motorbike, a Triumph. l know. The five cases from Harriet's list. And five more she missed. Three l'm sure of. Rebecka was the first, just as you thought. The second, M.H., is Mari Holmberg, a prostitute in Kalmar, murdered in 1954, matching Leviticus 20:18. Right. "lf a man lies with a woman having her sickness, he has made naked her fountain and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood." Raped and stabbed, but cause of death was suffocation by sanitary napkin. Okay. R.L. Rakel Lunde, 1957. A cleaning woman and part-time palm reader. Tied with a clothesline, gagged, raped. Head crushed with a rock. Leviticus 20:27. "A woman who is a medium or sorceress shall be put to death by stoning." l usually like to smoke outside. Sara Witt, 1964. Daughter of a pastor. Tied to her bed. Raped. Charred in the fire that burned down her house. Leviticus 21 :9. "The daughter of a priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot, profanes her father and shall be burned with fire." Magda Lovisa Sjöberg, 1960. Found in a barn. Stabbed and raped with farm tools. The cow in the next stall had its throat slit. lts blood was splashed on her and hers on it. Leviticus 20:16. "lf a woman lies with any beast, you shall kill the woman and the beast. Their blood is upon them." LlSBETH: Lea Persson, 1962. Found by her sister in their pet shop. Raped, beaten. The killer uncaged the animals, smashed the aquariums. There was a parakeet inside her. Next, Eva Gustavsson, 1960. A runaway. Raped, strangled. A burnt pigeon tied around her neck. Lena Andersson, 1967. A student. Raped, stabbed, decapitated-- Okay. l'm not finished. We're looking for a serial murderer, but what could that have to do with a teenager living on an island? She was looking for him too. MlKAEL: Rape. Torture. Fire. Animals. Religion. Am l missing anything? The names. They're all Biblical. The first woman, the whore, the Virgin Mary. Rebecka, Sara, all from the Old Testament. Which means they're all Jewish. One thing the Vangers have more than their fair share of, it's anti-Semites. There's one right there. LlSBETH: l can sleep on a couch. Okay. Um... Right. Ahem. Oh, yeah, there might be a cat somewhere. Good night. Night. Harriet's name isn't. lsn't what? Jewish. No. [PRlNTER WHlRRlNG] [COUGHlNG] What are you doing? Reading your notes. They're encrypted. Please. Have some coffee. Okay. Then we're gonna have a very serious conversation about what's yours and what's mine. Ahem. lt's amazing what you figured out with the parade photos. Thank you. lt's too bad you don't have hers. Whose? LlSBETH: Her. Can l--? Sorry. Yeah, all right. Close that. No. Not that. That's the one. Yep. Where the fuck is that? That's down there, isn't it? Okay. Oh, yeah, yeah. And... What does that say there? "N" something "R-S-J." That's "Norsjö," yeah. LlSBETH: Then something "K." Something "R-l-F." MlKAEL: "Carpentry." Well, we need to find a carpenter. Fuck! [♪♪♪] [CAMERA SHUTTER CLlCKlNG] [GAGGlNG] [CLEARS THROAT] MlKAEL: The carpentry shop is gone. l don't even know if he worked there or not, but if he did, maybe he used to come in here for hardware. l don't recognize him. Sorry. Well, l had to start somewhere. l'm no detective, but 1966, l would have started at a retirement home. MAN: This is Brännlund's kid. Do you know where l might find him? The son? Next to his father at the cemetery. He was killed in an accident on a construction site, years ago. But, uh... she might still be alive. His widow. Do you know where l might find her? GPS VOlCE: Please drive to highlighted route. ln 1966, you were in Hedestad with your husband. Oh! Who took these? A local photographer. You were taking pictures too that day, and l'd love to look at them if by some miracle you have them. lt wouldn't be a miracle. We were on our honeymoon. But why? This girl here. Here, you can see her better in the enlargement. See, that's you there. Just after this was taken, after she'd seen something across the street, she was murdered. How awful. There you are. Thank you.

Look, l have police reports, photos, Henrik's notes, my notes, Lisbeth's research. What l don't have is Vanger lndustries' records. That's what l want. Why? Will you authorize it? What, the private corporate records? Well, how far back? Henrik said l could have access to everything. This is what l need. That's not what he meant. l'll sign a nondisclosure statement. Just a minute. l think Henrik would say yes. That's why he has me, to protect him from himself. lt's insane. What have we got to hide? After 120 years of business, probably a lot. lf this is what he needs to finish, he should have permission. What am l looking for? Any connections between Vanger lndustries and the towns where the women were killed. And everything about Frode. [DOOR BUZZES] [♪♪♪] MlKAEL: Your father was taking pictures that day that no one has seen. l'd like to take a look at them. So ask him. l was wondering if you could do that. l don't speak to him.

Well, l just did. What? How's the investigation? Oh, yeah. That was his question. Do you hunt? We should go hunting together sometime. Sure. Nothing at all new to report? No. Nothing. l can see you're anxious. No. No, l mean to get home after the walk. Yeah, well, l suppose l am. To have dinner with your girlfriend. Assistant.

How did you do it? What did you find? [GRUNTS] We can talk or we can just get on with it. l found a photograph no one has seen. Of? You. ln an Uppsala prep school blazer. What does that prove? You lied about where you were that day. Did l? Or rather, when. So what? People lie all the time. lt also says that you and Lena Andersson were schoolmates. Lena. That was a long time ago. Where's this photo now? ls it with all the other crap on your desk? There's a copy on my laptop. There's another copy on a secure website. Secure website. Ha-ha-ha. That's a lie. How much does the girl know? l hope it's as much as you do. That'll make it fun. Where is she? Stockholm. She went this morning. That's a lie. She's at our offices looking at more old crap. l got a call from our archives manager. She was very perturbed with this girl Lisbeth. l like that name. Lisbeth. So when Lisbeth leaves, l will get a call from security, so l can be at your cottage to greet her. l can't thank you enough for bringing her to me. Hey, hey. [♪♪♪] So, what do you wanna know? You're a journalist, ask me questions. What do l do with the girls? That's a good question. Well, before, l do what we're doing: Sit down, relax, have a drink. l like that part a lot. Having a chat when both of you know that one of you is going to die. And afterwards, l just get rid of them, far out at sea. Unlike my father, who left them scattered all over the place, like trophies. That's not very smart, if you ask me. Well, he was a loud and garish man. Frankly, he got what he deserved. You can't be a sloppy technician like that. You can't drink to excess like he did. This takes discipline. lt's a science of a thousand details. The planning, the execution. lt's the cleanup. l guess l don't have to tell you, but you're going to create quite a mess here. [COUGHlNG] Shh-shh-shh. Shh. Let me ask you something. Why don't people trust their instincts? They sense something is wrong, someone is walking too close behind them. You knew something was wrong. But you came back into the house. Did l force you? Did l drag you in? No. All l had to do was offer you a drink. lt's hard to believe that the fear of offending can be stronger than the fear of pain, but you know what? lt is. And they always come willingly. And then they sit there. They know it's all over, just like you do. But somehow, they still think they have a chance. "Maybe if l say the right thing. Maybe if l'm polite. lf l cry, if l beg." And when l see the hope draining from their face, like it is from yours right now, l can feel myself... getting hard. But, you know, we're not that different, you and l. We both have urges. Satisfying mine requires more towels.

Since when have they said that? Since l was 12. What happened when you were 12? l'm sorry, that's-- That's none of my business. l tried to kill my father. Burned him alive. Got about 80 percent of him. Oh. l made some coffee. [COFFEE POURlNG] MlKAEL: Who's that? LlSBETH: lt's Harriet. l found it in Martin's basement among his souvenirs. No, Martin didn't deny killing anyone. But when l mentioned Harriet, he was confused. He got angry at me because l couldn't tell him what had happened to her. He didn't kill her. His father didn't do it. He was dead the year before. What if she did somehow manage to get away? l mean, if... she is still alive, then there's only one person in this family who'd know where she is. [SNORlNG] [BELL DlNGS] [♪♪♪] Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me. [CAR DOOR OPENS] Your turn. Right, um... Here. [DOORBELL RlNGS] Hi. Look, l'm sorry to bother you. What do you want? Has no one called you? About? Your cousin Martin. What about him? He died in a car accident last Thursday. There's going to be a memorial in Hedestad. l'm not interested in any memorial. Well, l understand. What do you understand? Well, that you don't care very much for your family. Look, l just thought you should know. Now l know. [♪♪♪] Ahem. How'd it go? Okay, l think. She's on. And she's shopping. She's still playing solitaire? Hm. MlKAEL: She hasn't called anyone? No. MlKAEL: We have her cell phone too? l was so sure she was gonna lead us to her. Put your hand back in my shirt. There's only one reason she hasn't called Harriet. She can't. Because Harriet is dead. [LlSBETH PANTlNG] l was just thinking that-- Just one second. Okay. [LlSBETH MOANlNG] [LlSBETH SlGHS] What were you going to say? l was just thinking, there could be one other possibility. ANlTA: Well, we could, absolutely. What is it now? Before he died, your brother hung me from a hook... Harriet. MlKAEL: So you sent the flowers. HARRlET: Yes, l did. MlKAEL: We found in the Swedish Family Registry that Anita was married. But the family never knew, did they? No. So l'm guessing she then came here on her married-name passport, and you followed on her maiden-name passport. No, actually, it was the other way around. She thought that it was safer if l traveled with Spencer myself. Well, what did he think about that? Nothing. Only that he loved her. She said, "lf you love me, you'll do this and not ask why." And he never did. And they both died 20 years ago. Car accident. You found that out too. ls that you? l was 14 the first time he raped me. Martin. No, my father. Martin only started after he had died. Well, why didn't you tell somebody? l did. My mother. Henrik would've done something. l almost told him. But l was afraid because of what l'd done. l, uh... You still don't understand, do you? A year after the first time, and there were many times during that year, my father got drunker than usual one night and he started bragging about the women he'd killed. He quoted from the Bible as he tore my clothes off. He tied a belt around my neck. He wanted to kill me. [SNlFFLES] l, um... l got out of the house. l went down to the dock. He came staggering after me. l could never fight him off in a small space, but out in the open, l was strong enough to deal with an old drunk. When it was over... l looked up and Martin was standing there, staring at me. And all l'd accomplished was substitute one for another. A couple of months later, Henrik sent Martin to school in Uppsala. And l thought that maybe, just maybe, the nightmare was finally over. And then l saw him the day of the parade, across the street. And l knew that it would never be over. So how did you escape? Anita. She... She insisted that l leave everything behind. lf l took anything the police might have suspected that l was still alive. As everyone ate dinner, l was no more than 20 meters away from them. I spent the night there. That's when the search started. In the morning, she came to get me. I'd grown up with that bridge as my link to home, but all l could think is, if l could just get away from them, just get past the police, then l might be safe. And l was. Until you showed up. You're safe now. How did you get away? Someone saved me too. MlKAEL: How are you feeling? l'm fine. Thank you, Anna. l made you a promise, whether you found anything or not. So, what do you have to tell me? VANGER: What's this? Hello, Henrik. [SOBBlNG] FRODE: l barely remember Wennerström working here, much less being fired. How could you? lt was such a long time ago, which is kind of more to the point than the money he embezzled from you. You're referring to the statute of limitations, but l had no idea this is what Henrik was holding out. lf l had, l never would've let him bring you up here. He wasn't trying to deceive you. He knows you can't try somebody 35 years after the event. l like Henrik, but he knows that. A man's reputation means something. He believes that. He thought you could destroy Wennerström in the court of public opinion. The court of public opinion celebrates people's bad behavior. He's an elderly man. He promised me Wennerström's carcass on a plate. This isn't even the plate. l can't do anything with this. Yes, of course. What happened with Wennerström? How did he get you? l was stupid. l heard something. l got it from an anonymous source, who l'm now sure was one of Wennerström's lackeys. lt was fake. Which he easily proved in court. You were emphatic that the way l looked into your life was illegal and immoral. Would you feel the same about Wennerström? Go on. l did some work on my own on him before you hired me. l haven't looked at it all because you and Harriet-fucking-Vanger have kept me busy. But l may have something. You may have something? Maybe. MlKAEL: They launder money from arms and drug sales and crime syndicates in Russia. And that money accounts for all but 5 percent of his holdings. The rest ends up in accounts in the Cayman lslands. And how do you know this? This time you don't want to know. This time l do want to know. l have access to his computer, and his accountant's and lawyer's. And how do you have that? l could've gotten it from a source inside the company. You didn't. But that's what you'll say. And what will you say to me? Well, that depends if you really want to know. l do. Mikael, how did you get access? [DOOR OPENS] [HELMET CLATTERlNG] [BLENDER WHlRRlNG] Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist, who, this time last year was convicted of libel [KNOCKlNG ON DOOR] in a Stockholm courtroom, doesn't seem to have learned from his mistakes. Or maybe he has. In the current issue of Millennium magazine, he now charges the company that sued him, the Wennerström Group MlKAEL: The shit hits the fan. of criminal activities on a global scale. What happens now? Well, he'll say it's a personal vendetta, which won't wash. The police will investigate, Fl will investigate. lt'll go to court. Maybe he'll go to prison. You think? Probably not. These guys never do.

[♪♪♪] These allegations, like the last one from this so-called journalist, are as ridiculous as they are untrue. I'll be seeing Mr. Blomkvist in court again, and l'm looking forward to it. What about his documentation? Fabricated. All of it. NEWSCASTER [ON TV]: The Securities Fraud Office isn't quite as certain as Mr. Wennerström of that. WOMAN: lf a fraction of what Mr. Blomkvist alleges proves to be true, not only will there be a securities investigation, but an organized-crime inquiry as well. REPORTER 1 : Mr. Blomkvist names no sources. WOMAN: And we can't force him to. But we can look for them. REPORTER 1 : Beginning where? WOMAN: Those closest to Mr. Wennerström. Only someone in the inner circle of a corporation like this has access to this kind of information. Mr. Wennerström isn't available for comment, but I'll be happy to answer questions. REPORTER 2: Where is he? LAWYER: At home, l imagine. REPORTER 2: No, he's not. Has he left the country? l don't, uh, think so. [BOTH SPEAK lNDlSTlNCTLY] [BEEPS] Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

REPORTER [ON TV]: A Swedish tourist vacationing here in Barbados says he knows where fugitive financier Hans-Erik Wennerström is: Here, in this Caribbean island's capital, Bridgetown.

[DlALlNG] [♪♪♪] [WOMAN SPEAKlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY OVER PA] REPORTER [ON TV]: The man who is now being called Sweden's Charles Ponzi may no longer have a country to call home, but does have enough money to buy one. According to the International Banking Commission, Wennerström, a week after the Millennium article appeared on newsstands, began emptying accounts at Bank of Kroenenfeld in the Cayman lslands. That money, approximately 2 billion euros, was then spread over a number of accounts with the help of this confederate, seen here in Zurich. Hey. Hey. The money l borrowed. Already? Mm. Thank you.
