Tom. Today's target, Man Seng Bank. OK. How many accounts do we need to handle? Twelve accounts. HKD $1.5 billion. I'm starting to attack. You can start laundering in ten minutes. Warning! Virus Invasion Alert Warning! Warning! Virus Invasion Alert Warning! I can't withdraw money from the ATM! It's the third bank that I've been to. I can't trade my shares. What's going on? Such a failure as a huge bank. Internet banking is also malfunctioning. I can't withdraw my money! Warning! Virus Invasion Alert Hey The server of Man Seng Bank has been locked. We are dealing with it. This is the access record. We found many IPs from different countries. Can't fix this. Let's reboot. Mr. and Mrs. Cheuk. Why do you think that our school is suitable for your child? Bowie has been interested in Astronomy since a very young age. She always dream about joining the Young astronaut program which is hosted at your school every year. Mr. Cheuk. If it's an emergency, you may return your call outside. We shall continue the conversation after. Excuse Me. No worries. According to the records, Bowie had a heart surgery. She is on a waiting list for a heart transplant? What is your name? Can you introduce yourself? Jason Ka Chun, where are you? What is it? All of Man Seng Bank's ATMs have malfunctioned! What do we do? Tell those in Man Seng Bank, if they are not granting us immediate access now, we cannot handle the issue before too late. I can't be saved either if you don't return soon. Hurry up! How dare you! Hello, this is Man Seng Bank. Sorry for the inconvenience, our service is temporarily on hold. What happened? Anybody went to check on the server? OK... Understood. In fifteen minutes, headquarter will grant Sky Magic Pro immediate access to fix the system. OK. Got it. The overseas accounts that receives money today can only last for five minutes. You have to finish the whole laundering process in five minutes. Five minutes won't be enough! Thanks. Man Seng Bank just granted privileged access. Don't thank me. Here we are. The privileged access of Man Seng Bank. Look at it carefully. Hurry up. The privileged access of Man Seng Bank. OK, thanks. Mr. Fan. Get out! Coffee. Get out! Ready? You have five minutes. The transfer has begun. "Sky Magic Pro Cybersecurity Company" "has business all over the world." "In the next five years, we estimate..." What's the situation? Where is the log report? It's here. Any leakage of customer's informaton? Chun. Nothing yet. Chun... What's wrong? Every firewall version has been tested. It was all the same. These hackers seem to be more familiar with the system than we do. They know all of the loopholes. We close one access They opened up ten other backdoors. They are aiming right at our loopholes. But it doesn't seem like a normal DDoS. Even rebooting cannot fix the issue. Have you tried to enter from a backdoor? I've tired, but failed to get in. Really? Let me try. Jason Man Seng already gave us access, it should be impossible for bank accounts to have any activities. Someone in your company just got in. I am blocking him now. How is it going over there? I'm working on it. Have a look right now. Hurry up. I need some time to erase all the trace. Jason... Remember I've been inventing Firewall-X? But it's never been tested. Would it be risky? We might be in trouble afterwards. If we don't give it a shot, we will definitely be in trouble. If we can stop the attack, they might still have time to fix the problems. Transmittance of three accounts has been completed. There are... Ninety seconds left. Just a little bit more. HKD 1.5 million dollars has been transferred successfully. Wait. It's not done yet. Haven't all twelve accounts' finished transferring? Almost there! Are you done? I really need some time to erase the trails. Stop rushing me! Are you sure? Every firewall has it's loopholes. As long as those hackers do not notice. I will be your backup. Someone is altering the system. I can't wait. I have to erase it now. Delete all of the transaction records. Look. Someone installed a new firewall. What the heck? Have you erased all? All gone. Are you sure? Sure. Who installed the new firewall? It's me. I saw some abnormal activities on several bank accounts. Something bad might happen if we don't stop them. Brilliant. But have you noticed that if anything goes wrong with an untested firewall, there will be great consequences for the company I know, but... But what? Why didn't you come to me first? How did it happen? Mr. Chan. Mr. Chan, It was such a close call. Luckily, the attack has been stopped. This X version was loaded by Ka-chun. I was his backup. Well done. His firewall is a trial version. Cheuk Ka-chun is the only one who has access privilege. This is against the rule. For the security reason, hand out your Firewall-X. Also, give me access. How about this... Let them handle the server first, we will talk to the management about the authorizations. Don't release your access yet, keep it safe! Okay. Frankie, come to my office. You have transferred an extra HKD$500 million. Why? Just earning some pocket money on the side. Who was it? Someone I know? I've been laundering money for you all this time. I have never asked who you work for. Five minutes' the limit. That is Tom's problem. Any more complaints? I do the job, take the blame and the risks are on me. Do you really feel it's fair? Think about it. Sky Magic Pro Head Office top management just contacted our Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau. We have started the investigation regarding someone exploiting security vulnerabilities to engage in illegal activies. Were you able to find any attacking source from Sky Magic Pro's backup logs? The hacker cleared all trails, we couldn't find anything. Four times in two years. Sudden system breakdown. Just like what happened with Man Seng Bank. This can't be a coincedence. Someone in Sky Magic Pro might be corrupted. I need to check whether any employees in Sky Magic Pro. Has offshore accounts. Got it. The attack from yesterday doesn't seem random. There might be a motive Although customers accounts are fine in Man Seng Bank at the moment. Do you know that fifty thousand new computer viruses each day? The hackers are really good at their job. Any single virus they created can sabotage your server. How hard is that? It's over. It's useless to keep thinking about it. Your daughter has recovered. Unlike me, the company is giving you opportunities. You should go on a vacation. Spend more time with your daughter. My daughter was in the hospital for three years. She has not yet adapted this new society. By the way, how was the interview? It's been a while. Now she has to reintergrate into society, she hesitates a lot when meeting strangers. I can see you bring a book here. Are you going to show me? I wish she could get into a nice school. It's a digital world. What's the purpose in studying? Just like you, whenever there is a computer with you, you can do everything by just hitting the Enter Key. Medicine time. Medicine time... Medicine time... It is so annoying. Bowie Cheuk. I know you. That's why I upgraded OLI. So that we can watch over you anytime, anywhere. Or else, you will forget to take your medicine when you are having fun in school. Sanitization's done. Take your medicine. There's no need. I don't have a school to go to. Who said that? I am a sick person. Miss. What a coincidence. Actually Bowie wasn't feeling well on that interview day. She might not be expressing herself too well because of that. Please give her one more chance. She really put a lot of effort into this. The result of the interview was finalized. I am sorry, Mr. Cheuk. She already lost three years of her life. As you know, our school is a private institution. Many courses and facilities are operated by trust funds. We have issue bonds on behalf of the school. It costs between HKD $0.8 to $5 million. You can think about it. Inspector Suen, we found something. HKD $10 million have been transferred to this overseas bank account. Whose account is that? Chief Information Security Officer Frankie. I want a thorough background search within 24 hours. Roger. How are you doing, Mr. Pong? What makes you so urgent to meet? Did it go well? Yes, very smooth. Frankie laundered extra money. Were you involved? No. Frankie wasn't in his right mind the other day. I already took care of it. By how? Come. Brother. Wai. Wai. Brother. Wai. Let him go. Let go of my brother. Let go of him. No. I didn't do it. Harder. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hello Frankie I want to... apologize. I shouldn't have spoke to you like that. Let's catch up at dinner and forget about what happened. I want... his whole family. Oh yes, have your wife join us. Bring your daugther too. Let's buy this one? Sure. Really? Let's go and buy it with daddy tomorrow. Yes. What's wrong, dear? I have no idea, hold our daughter tight. Honey. Find another scapegoat. Don't think about playing any tricks. Inspector Suen. Frankie and his family are dead. There must be someone who's behind his death. Monitor every single staff in Sky Magic Pro. Yes, sir. Daddy. What are you doing? Mr. Cheuk. The company won't be a guarantee of your loan. Thank you. Mr. Chan wants to see you in his office. OK, thanks. What happened to Frankie was a pity. As for the incident of Man Seng Bank, you handled it very well last time. We need a replacement for his position. Management wants to offer you this opportunity. There are so many staff to be managed. Does the company really think that I am a good fit? I think that you are, that's all it matters. Here. Here are your benefits, which is same as what Frankie had before. Nothing more, nothing less. By the way, as for your loan... Management and I agreed to privately grant your loans. The transmittance will be made soon. We understand. It's tough to be a good father now. However, you've got to keep a low profile. If you can't get the jobs done, I'll have to go by the books. Absolutely. I believe we can work well together. Definitely. Excuse me. Alright. You have to avoid certain food while taking that medication. I can send you the list later. I'm sorry. I accidentally saw it just now. My daughter is also taking the same medication. OK. Thanks. I'm home. Daddy. Mrs. Cheuk, it's all been checked. I've exchanged the filter, please sign here. Alright. Thanks a lot. Thank you. They were here to check the air conditioners. Someone is coming over to set up the Wi-Fi later. That's efficient! When did you make the appointment? The secretary from your company May called me and said that everything has been arranged. Did you drop by our old house to get the letters? It's all here. Alright. How is it, Bowie? Have you been helping mom for the chores? Of course. Did you get the pizza? Of course. Show daddy what you've packed. Inspector Suen. HKD $800 thousand has been transmitted to Cheuk Ka-chun's account. Find out where that transmittance came from. Copy that. How are you going to pay the HKD $800 thousand debt if you don't take the job? Don't worry, I'll take care of it. I want our daughter to have hope. It's tough. But we will get through this together. Daddy, OLI is not following my orders. It is not listening to any of my commands. Not following orders? How naughty? Bro, why are you so late? I just upgraded the Virus-X, and waiting for your Firewall-X. This version is incredible. My home computer has been hacked. Help me trace the source immediately. How serious? OLI is already connected to my computer. You can get in from this IP address. No one can notice you easily. The hacker has been using tons of anonymous IPs. It's being changed almost every five seconds. Pin his location for me. Bingo! That's weird. At least four to five companies were registered under the same address. All of them are overseas companies registered in Pacific Rim. Those companies' bank accounts do not have usual transactions. The amounts involved were significant. There's only one possibility. Money laundering. Among those companies, the one who owns the biggest shares is you. Hey, I saw an HKD $800 thousand transaction has been made into your personal bank account. The share holder of this overseas company is also you, Cheuk Ka-chun. Did you spend the money? What's with all those offshore accounts? Why are there so many companies registered under my name? You set me up, didn't you? You are a smart guy. There's no freebie in this world. That HKD $800 thousand was a welcoming gift. We will work together from now on. Fortune will keep coming. Are you crazy? I won't do anything illegal. What did you do before? Your livelihood was selling virus. You went to jail for that. I am offering you an opportunity. I atoned for my mistakes in jail. I did something wrong for once, it doesn't mean I am going to do it again. Don't condescendingly think that you're smart. Think about it. All you have to do is to press the Enter Key. I'm Inspector Suen Ban from the Cyber Crimes Unit. Please take a seat. HKD $800 thousand. Any explanations? I don't know how to explain. You've asked for a loan from your company. The application was rejected. You needed the money. So you got into the money laundering business with Frankie. I didn't do it. Criminals never admit that they broke the law. In 2005, you were charged with "access to computer with dishonest intent" and illegally selling computer viruses. You erased all of your overseas criminal records and got into Sky Magic Pro. Why would I trust a criminal like you? That was in the old days... Daddy. What are you doing? Since I got married, and had my daughter. I've promised myself, I'd never get derailed. That HKD $800 thousand was made from Chan Ming-chi. Before you brought me in, he already admitted that he was using Sky Magic Pro to launder money. Any proof? Frankie and I were just pawns. Frankie suddenly died from an accident. Did you guys investigate? If I was really in money laundering, do you think you'd find out that easily? Hold him for 48 hours. Don't even think of bail. Yes, Sir. Wait a moment. I'll help you find evidence from Chan Ming-chi to prove that I'm innocent. Until we have evidence on Chan, you are still a suspect. Don't try anything stupid. Hello? In three days, the money will be here. Did you find the scapegoat? Yes, I did. I'll handle it by myself. Good. Wait for my call. Don't worry. We can get through this. Chan Ming-chi has been using the vulnerability of the firewall in Sky Magic Pro for money laundering. In order to arrest him, we need two things. First, when he launders the money all logs from Sky Magic Pro's servers have to be backed up. Second, it would be the data in his computer. We need to prove that his computer is in control of the transactions. We need both of them as evidence to complete the charges. That way we would be able to charge him. That's why you must help us to collect both evidence. Are you sure your senior's computer has the information you want? Inspector Suen told me that he already inspected everyone's computer in the company except Chan Ming-chi's. This is the latest version of Virus-X I hope it could help you. It's not that easy to collect both evidence. If I hack in when he is laundering money, he might find out. And I won't have enough time to save the log. As in Chan's computer, his firewalls are not easy to hack either. I tried to hack into his computer. There's a very strong defense mechanism in the system. In his computer, there are seventeen different kinds of firewalls. Every single backdoor of the firewalls has different moving patterns. In order to crack it, I might need more than one virus. If I fail to crack it in twenty seconds, the whole system will lock up, and the data could be automatically wiped off. Everything will be erased. I need some time. Mike I've been inventing AI on OLI this whole time. I was thinking... if I combine your Virus-X with it, what do you think is going to happen? AI and virus? Seriously? I always want to try this. Chan uses incredibly complex firewalls. I only have twenty seconds to pass through them. I'm thinking of utilizing machine learning to collect as many different firewalls as possible, and let your Virus-X learn to calculate the algorithms of each firewall. As long as we can figure out Chan's firewalls' patterns. I'll be able to access his operating system from a backdoor. However, this virus may unlock the backdoors of all OS. Aren't you worried? Don't worry. I'll only target Chan's computer. Besides, I'll remodel OLI. So only it can give commands and control the virus. How many servers did you open for the virus to learn? 1/20 servers from the server room. Only 1/20 of the servers can do such an impressive job? Imagine the monster it will become if you opened all the servers. Hey, Bro. I'm not trying to discourage you, but you got Plan B? There isn't a Plan B this time. In these two days, I'll go and retrieve the backup logs from Sky Magic Pro. I'll link the company server to the server of your police station. As long as it's well hidden, Chan Ming-chi won't be able to finds out. Once he begins to launder money, you can snatch all of the activity records from the server at the police station. How about his computer? I'll be using an innovative AI virus to hack into his computer. I'm still working on this virus. Not sure if it works. It'll be risky. Is this the only way? Yes. Deal. Mommy, shall I put this helmet on or not? Yes. How about this craft work? Shall I bring it too? Come here. Be steady. Today is the Open Day. Be brave, don't hesitate. Yes. Today's target is Hong Seng Bank. HKD $2 billion. Alright. Hello? Hong Seng Bank. Who is the counterpart today? It's me. That's it. The backdoor is now accessible. They are in action now. Hey, everyone. Stand By. I will begin the attack. (Warning!) (Virus Invasion Alert) (Warning!) (Virus Invasion Alert) What's wrong suddenly? What's going on? My ATM card is jammed. All machines are malfunctioning. None of the buttons are responding. When will the technicians arrive? We're handling it. The soonest we can. The server is down again? Where's the report? We need it right now. You can begin the money laundering in two minutes. Mike Chan will launder money now. I'm going to use the AI virus to hack into his computer now. Are you serious? It hasn't been tested. How do you know if it will work? I can't wait anymore. Let me take the risk. Login Succeeded. Three seconds? The money is coming in. We are copying the data. Hello, how's it going over there? I am in. I am copying the data from Chan's computer. Good. Dark web? Mike, there's a bug in the AI virus. It went through Chan's computer to the server and opened all the backdoors. Any ways to fix it now? I'll try. Without any protection, outside virus can get in here It will attack all the server. All of the connecting devices will be contaminated. What happened? The computers are all down. Hey, the log has stopped copying. All computers here have been attacked. What the hell did you do? There is a bug in the virus that's running towards all directions. It went through the server that Chan hooked up and got out. Same situation happened at your side. If the computers are infected by the virus, all protection will be gone. What do we do now? Restore. Restore all of the computers. Stop the virus from spreading out. No, if we do that everything related to Chan's evidence will be erased. I have them. Mr. Chan, the transaction failed. Hello. It's me. What happened? Even my computer is under attack. This is not good. Come over right now. Mr. Chan. Securities said all fire alarms are activated. They are investigating, but suggest us to evacuate now. Where is Ka-chun? I have no clue. I can't fix the bug from the virus, and it has already escaped via the network. It has to be stopped right now! The only way to stop it is to restore. Ka-chun. What are you doing here? All the computers are malfunctioned. Jason, give it back to me. Don't ask me, go talk to Mr. Chan. Listen. Give me, just give it back to me. Did you know Chan Ming-chi has been using the company for money laundering? Not our money, what's the issue? Are you confessing that you are with them? So what? At your own discretion! Chun. Where is Ka-chun? He ran. Did he say anything? Not a word. Where's the evidence? It's with me. I'll wait for you at the police station. Okay. How's it going? Negative. Hey. Abduct someone for me. Does Mr. Pong know? No need to bother him. Talk to you after it's done. I'll send you the information. That's all. Someone said that... an astronaut is like a scientist who can drive a spaceship. To become an astronaut, it takes at least five years of training. For example some trainings under zero gravity. Please leave a message. Honey, bring Bowie and meet me at Central Police District Headquarters. Immediately. Get in. Don't move. He combined the virus with AI. He also hacked into your computer and made a copy of our money laundering activities as evidence. Now all computers are down, and the money has been frozen. It should have something to do with this thingy. How to solve it? How? Damn. The system is restoring. Why is it restoring? Those money during laundering will be all gone. Where is the server room? Over here. What's happening? What now? Hey, say something! Cheuk Ka-chun, awesome. Awesome. So? What do we do to fix it? What happened? I have no idea. It was all him. What happened? The virus is uncontrollable. It got out from the company's network. Basically, any device that can access the internet will have its backdoor opened, That means all are without protections now. Any device could get infected. Are you done? Just fix it. All of the source codes of the virus are inside this device. It's now connected to internet. I only care whether the money can be transferred. I can access the network, but the server of Sky Magic Pro is down. I need some time to... Stop explaining, just do it. Let me try to fix it with my anti-viruses softwares. How is it? I've tried multiple times. The money can't be moved. As long as the backdoors of the server are opened, viruses will continue to get in. The server will keep being repeatedly infected. I can't command the operation, to close the backdoors. Which makes Cheuk Ka-chun the only person who can fix this. If this device can connect to the internet, that means we can contact outside, right? You must use it to connect to the internet. I can restore your cell phone. Turn off internet connection. You might be able to contact outside. Hack there. Reboot both of his and my cell phones. I have to find him. Where are you? He got away. We are still searching. Don't hang up, I'll give you the information. Find Cheuk Ka-chun's location immediately. It's done. He went into Tai Kwun. Got it, Tai Kwun. He headed to the backstairs. Up there. Hey. Let's go. LET'S GO! Go. How is it? We lost him. I saw it. Where is his daughter? Today's the open day of Han Tar. Go to Han Tar right now. Get his daughter. Roger that. Is Ka-chun here yet? Not yet, but many places in Hong Kong have internet blackout. Leave it, the priority is finding Cheuk Ka-chun. Yes, sir. What happened? The internet is dead. It's down The screen is flickering. What happened? Yes, We can't go on internet. It's weird. I was just using it. Now it's not responding Same here. Where is Bowie? I don't know. Bowie? Bowie? Bowie? Bowie? Bowie? Bowie Cheuk. Bowie Cheuk. Mommy. Bowie. Mommy. Bowie. Bowie. Bowie. This is Chan Ming-chi. Your husband is now at Central Police District Headquarters. He took something from me. The police can't save your daughter. Bowie. Officer. I am here to see Inspector Suen Ban from the Cyber Crimes Unit. I am Cheuk Ka-chun. Wait a moment. Hello. There is a man called Cheuk Ka-chun looking for Inspector Suen. Thank you. Kenny. Cheuk Ka-chun is here. Go downstairs and get him here. Yes, sir. Honey. You can't report to the police. What happened? I'm fine. Why shouldn't I report to the police? Where's Bowie? Your manager abducted Bowie. He said you took something from him. Hello. Let me talk to your husband. Hello. Cheuk Ka-chun. I am still at the office. Where's the memory card? Give me back my daughter. Come back right now. Where is Cheuk Ka-chun? Over there. Let's go. Cheuk Ka-chun. The three of you go that way, the rest follow me. (This station is closing) (because of a signalling fault.) (We apologize for... ) Yung Shan. I've got the evidence for charging Chan Ming-chi. To save Bowie, I'll have to go back to the office. I can come with you. No. There's a GPS service in Bowie's watch. As long as we can connect to the net we'll be able to get Bowie's location. Understood? I understand. I can't let anything bad happen to Bowie. Nor you. Where is the memory card? Where's my daughter? Where is my daughter? Tom Bowie. No problem. If I can have my money back, you will have your daughter back. You promised. In five minutes, the backdoors will be closed. Use your latest anti-virus software, to scan and isolate the virus. Your money can be moved again. It's unlocked. The money transfer is back in progress. Stop. Stop. Transfer that HKD $2 billion, to buy BY-West coin and then transfer into this account. We're not sure where the viruses are, that trading platform may be infected too. You heard that? How do we do it? It sounds bad. I'm toasted if Mr.Pong finds out. If you fail to get it done, you won't be alive too! If I have to check on that trading platform, I need some time. Hurry up. Why is it beeping? My battery is running out. My mom has a spare battery. Can you tell her? There is uniform police officer who saw Cheuk Ka-chun's wife in Po Tuck Street. Bring her in. Bring his wife here. That trading platform is clear. You can trade now. What are you waiting for? Where's my daughter? Bowie. Mommy is here. I can't breathe. Police. To Wing-shan. We suspect your husband Cheuk Ka-chun... might be involved in money laundering. We need you to come with us for investigation. The HKD $2 million has been transferred to your e-wallet. Pack it up. Your daughter is here. Two computers are back on. (The chief of Sky Magic Pro Cybersecurity Company) (Cheuk Ka-chun is suspected to be involving in) (violation of Computer Fraud and Abuse Act) (by hacking into the banking system with virus) (and intending to launder money.) (He is now being wanted by the police.) (The wife of Cheuk Ka-chun) (was under arrested earlier.) Her blood oxygen level is merely at eighty. And her blood pressure is dropping. Her state is getting worse. Her organs will start failing. Inform the ICU. Take her to the operation room right now. Wait a moment. Bowie. Bowie. Sir, are you the father of the girl? Doctor. How's my daughter doing? We'll have to get her into operation immediately. Her condition is getting worse. She is in critical condition. Please be prepared for the worst. Cheuk Ka-chun. Don't condescendingly think that you're smart. You've been to jail. There is no free lunch in this world. (The chief of Sky Magic Pro Cybersecurity Company Cheuk Ka-chun) (is suspected to be involving in intrusion of banking system) (and committed money laundering activities.) (Huge amount of money is involved.) (Police claims the suspect is on the run.) (Any citizens who witnessed the suspect, please call... ) Lock the door when you leave. Mike I am a wanted man. I have to find Chan Ming-chi. Bro, what can I do to help? I saw him entering the dark web, when I hacked into his computer a while ago. He went to a trading platform called Silver River. Get me a login ID. I have to find him no matter what. OK. I'll give you a TOR browser first. You got to be careful. Things are different here now. There are all sorts of trades. People are not only selling viruses. These people are eccentrics. Don't get in trouble with them. What did he buy from you? Hey! Are you insane? You attacked that buyer? The rule here is that you cannot attack other users. Those people are lunatics. They are attacking you now. If they find your information and locate your real identity, you'll be in big trouble. Just leave. This is Cheuk Ka-chun. I am looking for Suen Ban. Inspector Suen, Cheuk Ka-chun is here. Where's the evidence to charge Chan Ming-chi? He erased all of them. However, I got into the dark web. I found his trading logs. He bought two fake passports. Unless you catch him now. You won't be able to find him ever again, if he gets to leave Hong Kong. Two fake passports. Who's with him? I don't know. But I can send it to you. Inform all officers nearby. Have them bring him in immediately. Suspect Cheuk Ka-chun is at Lam Tin street. Officers nearby, please check in immediately. I've done so much for you. Even my family got dragged into misery. I must catch that bastard. Find out who that is. Yes, sir. Go to Chan Ming-chi's home. Make an excuse and bring him in. Roger. Mike Do you remember years ago in the dark web, there was a user who traded with me all the time? No More Cry? Do you know if he is still on Silent River? He made a big trade a while ago. Very famous now. Now he owns an extremely tough ransomware. All of your information will be unveiled... If you get hooked by it. Post today's internet blackout news onto the dark web forum. Spread the news that I'm having that virus on sale. I'm sure he will show up. (Massive outage disrupts internet service in Hong Kong.) (It's being repaired gradually after five hours.) Can't imagine seeing you here. Haven't seen you for ages. Yes, that's right. You were behind the case of the American oil pipeline? Absolutely, I've been working on it for so long. Awesome, right? Awesome. I wonder if you are interested in... Yes. Yes. You've created a havoc in Hong Kong. Yes. Are you familiar with doxxing? How could I run a blackmailing business if I am not good at doxxing? That's perfect. Find me this guy. This virus will open all of the backdoors in your device. You must aware that you are wanted by a lot of people. He made a trade today. What kind of trade? No idea. He is still making the trade on Silent River. Inspector Suen. Chan Ming-chi sold his house two weeks ago. No one knows where he is. Sir, we've found it. The man in the picture was Chan's brother, Chan Ming-wai. Brother. Keep an eye on your brother. Don't think about playing any tricks. No matter where you go, I'll find you guys. Share the information of both passports with customs. Roger. We can't let them get out of town. Cheuk Ka-chun, I know that you can hear me. You are just a pleb. You are not capable of handling this. Cheuk Ka-chun. Cheuk Ka-chun. Mike send me a decoder. I want to hack into the surveillance cameras nearby, and see what Chan Ming-chi is up to. Suen Ban. I just witnessed Chan Ming-chi shot someone. I've loaded a Trojan malware into his cell phone. Now there is enough evidence, can you arrest him now? Give me his location. Let's go. Where are you guys? Almost there. Inspector Suen, the location has pinged here. Found his cell phone. Chan Ming-chi discovered... He is definitely leaving tonight, dash to the airport now and stop him. He knows that he is being followed, he might not show up tonight. He will find another way to leave. Take your medicine. Take your medicine. Take your medicine. You have to avoid certain food while taking this medication. My daughter is also taking the same medication. OK, thanks. Chan might be in Mirador Mansion. Mirador. Go! Bastard. Police. Go. Move. I'll drag your family to hell. Move. Move. Police. Cheuk Ka-chun. If you fire the gun, you can not be a father anymore. Daddy What are you doing? Put the gun down. Put the gun down. I got the car, how long are you two going to take? Daddy said he might take a little while. Hurry Up. Oh, OK. Are you done? Mommy's been waiting for you outside for a long time. Since you've been such a good girl this time. I'll let you give OLI a new command. Let me see? Alright. Please! I want some privacy. OK. Brilliant. I want OLI to shut up. It's not working. Like this. Amazing, isn't it?
