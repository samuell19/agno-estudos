Thank you for taking me out tonight. This is so much fun. - It was a nice change of pace, wasn't it? - Yes, it was. - We need to do this more often. - I think we should. You know, I wish we didn't have to celebrate our anniversary a week early. But the opera was a wonderful surprise. Thank you so much. - Well, I figured this way you couldn't be too mad at me. - This is true (laughs). - Want a drink? - Sure, why not? (ice rattling) (ice rattling) (lid unscrewing) (liquid pouring) So, where did you find this place at? - This is the kind of place you get when you wait till the last minute to book a romantic anniversary gift for your wife. - Gotcha. Well, at least there isn't a heart-shaped tub in the middle of the room (laughs). - Yeah, that would have cost extra. (both laughing) - You know, honey, you really need to stop taking on such a heavy workload. I wanna spend more time with you. - I know. I know. After the new year, things will ease up. Hey, I'm here now, right? - Right, I know. - Let me get this last case out of the way, and then I'm all yours, I promise. - Yeah, but for how long? Ray, you always say that. The girls and I miss seeing you at dinner, honey. Your daughters need you. - I'll tell you what. Let's go on a vacation, the four of us. - (gasps) Oh my, yes. Yes, that, that, we can escape from all of this as a family. - I'll make you a deal. We'll go wherever you want to go. - I am going to pick the perfect spot. - Oh, I know you will. (Teri laughing) To us. - To us. (glasses clinking) - Well, I feel like living a little dangerous tonight. (Teri laughing) Let me go check out the facilities. - Okay. (knocking on door) Who is it? - [Mugger] Room service. - Room service? (Teri gasping) - Just (whispers). (Teri squealing) (soft suspenseful music) - Sh, you gotta be very quiet (laughs). Where's your husband, huh? (Teri stuttering) Where? - Bathroom. (mugger laughing) - Honey, are you okay? Teri. - Sh sh, sh sh. - What do you want from us? - I want your wallet, Old Man. Hand it over, right now. (Teri crying) - Okay, okay, I'm reaching in my back pocket and giving it to you, okay? (Teri crying) - Hey, what do you say, Old Man? Will you share? - Here, just take it. Take it and let her go please. - That's real nice of you. - [Ray] You have what you want. It's all yours. Now just please leave us alone. - Nah. I want more. This isn't nearly enough. - What else? - Well, um, let me have your wife (laughs). - No! - One more step, Old Man, and I'll slit her fucking throat. (Teri screaming) - Fuck you! (dramatic music) (mugger laughing) - Not bad, Old Man. (both groaning) (soft dramatic music) (upbeat rock music) (indistinct singing) (Teri gasping) (Teri shrieking) - No, no get off! No, get off! Get off! - Mom? Mom? (Teri shrieking) Mom? Mom, Mom, Mom, wake up. It's me. It's me! (Teri shouting) You were just dreaming. - Oh my God, Cassie, I'm so sorry, honey. - It's okay. Are you okay? - Oh my God. I didn't mean to scream. Honey, did I scare you? - No, I'm fine. - Oh my God. Oh! - Does it hurt? - Yes (coughs). It doesn't help that I slept funny too. What time is it, honey? - It's after two. - Oh my God. I slept all day? - Yeah. I guess the doctor wasn't joking when he said the pills were gonna make you drowsy. - No, no, Cassie. Honey, I can't sleep all night and all day too. - Mom, the doctor said it was good for you. You need your rest. It'll help you heal faster. - Honey, I have a memorial to plan. - Mom, there's no rush. - No. (Teri coughing) It shouldn't have to wait. Regardless of how I feel. I'll wrap myself in plastic. I'll take a shower. And like always, I'm gonna take care of your father. He's all by himself in an urn downstairs. - Mom, I know. I know you're gonna take care of it. But everyone understands. It's okay. (Teri coughing) - You know, we discussed this a couple of times. You know, what would happen if one of us went first and he said if it was him, he wanted his ashes spread over by the lake, because he thought it was pretty there, and it was peaceful and quiet. - And we're gonna do that, as soon as you get better. Okay? - All right, honey. Can you get me my pain pills please? - Of course. - Thank you. It's the Oxycontin. - I know, I got it. (pills rattling) (water running) - Oh, can I have two? - Prescription says just one. - Oh. Thank you, Doctor. Hey, I found something. - [Cassie] What is it? - [Teri] It's under the bed. - [Cassie] Under the bed? - It's in a box, under the bed. (bed creaking) (Teri coughing) - Oh my God, what is it? (both laughing) Oh my God. (Teri laughing) Lizzie? - Yes. - Oh my God, I thought I got rid of all my toys. - Oh you did. But I wasn't gonna let you get rid of her. - I'd forgotten. - Your dad brought her home when he was in Charlottesville. - He missed my recital, right? - Oh my goodness (sniffs). Our Cassie was Clara in the "Nutcracker." And it was the beautiful Christmas one. - It was his way of making it up to me. - Yes. He was so good at that. (soft piano music) - Some of your handiwork? - Yes, you put poor Lizzie through the ringer. You took her everywhere with you. (Teri sniffing) I have an idea. You have not left my side this entire week. - You need help. - I know, honey, and I appreciate everything you've done for me. Really, I do. But your job is to be a teenager, not a caretaker. - Mom, I don't mind. - Well I do. You have been bound in this house this whole week. Why don't you give Mitch a call? Mitch is dying to see you, I know this. - Mom, Mitch can wait. I don't wanna leave you here alone. It might not be safe. - Honey, detectives are working on this. They have a composite, they have a description. That's all we can do right now, okay? - But he knows where we live. And if he's seen the news, he knows that you told the cops. (door creaking) - (gasps) Oh, Denise. Oh God, oh my God. - I'll go talk to her. - Honey, please do. I don't want you two girls to worry about this. It's not your job. - But, Mom, it's ... - You know what? (sniffs) Look. You know what today is? - Your anniversary? - Yes. 20 years. We were so happily married. We were so in tune with each other. And we almost made it. (sniffs) So I ... I kinda wanna have the house to myself. And I wanna be alone with your father. I hope I didn't hurt your feelings. - No, no, I completely understand. This is your day. - Okay. Honey, do me a favor? - Of course. - Will you take Denise to Amanda's house? I told her she could spend the night. - Yeah, of course. - Okay. I'll pick her up in the morning, okay? - Okay. - Okay, honey. - Is there anything else you want me to do before I go? - No, honey, you've done so much for me. Thank you. I love you. - I love you too. - Be safe, okay? - Okay, I won't stay out too long, okay? - Okay, honey (sniffs). You have fun. - I will. (Teri sniffing) (music box playing) (knocking on wood) - Can I come in? - No, but you will anyway. - That's true. - Did Mom send you in? - No, it was my idea. - Okay, well, let's get it over with. - What? - Whatever speech you're about to give. - Can I sit down? - Guess so. - Why are you so upset? - I'm scared. - About what you heard? - I didn't know he knew where we lived. Why doesn't anyone tell me what's going on? Everything's a secret. I'm not a little kid anymore. - You're right. You're not. - Will you tell me? How does this guy know? - He, um, he took Dad's wallet. It had his ID in it. - So he could come in then, right? I mean, he didn't kill Mom, but what if he wants to? And then what if he kills us too? - Denise, he just wanted the money. He doesn't care about anything or anyone else. I bet he's ditched it already. His face is all over the news. He wouldn't risk it. We're as safe as we've ever been. - I just can't believe this is happening to us. - Hey, listen, get dressed up and I'll take you over to Amanda's, okay? - Okay. - I'm gonna go call Mitch. Be ready in 10? - Yeah. - Yeah, all right, all right (laughs). (Teri sniffing) (phone buzzing) (phone buzzing) (phone buzzing) (phone buzzing) - Oh. (Teri sighing) (Teri sniffing) Oh. (birds singing) Oh. (Teri sniffing) - Yeah, my mom thinks it's a good idea for me to get outta the house for a while. Sounded like it was better for her than me. - What do you mean? - I'll tell you about it later. - Okay. Let me ask my dad right now if I can borrow the truck, and then I'll come get you. - Think he's gonna let you? - It was one speeding ticket, one time. Plus I paid that shit off already. He can't hold that against me forever, can he? - Well hurry up, I'm starving. I'm dying for a burger and a shake. - You buying? - Very funny. - All right, all right, I'll be right there. - Okay, cool, and ... Hey, there's something important I need to talk to you about, okay? - Yeah. Sure. - Okay. (Cassie exhaling) (box clattering) - Mom? We're leaving. Okay. (suspenseful music) (Teri shrieking) - You're not going anywhere. Not before I get a taste. (siren blaring) Shit. (knife stabbing) (Teri groaning) There's something to remember me by. (Teri groaning) (body thudding) (suspenseful music) I'll be seeing you. (suspenseful music) (pills rattling) (water running) (soft music) (music stops) (bag tearing) (bag tearing) (Teri groaning) (soft piano music) (Teri crying) - Ray! No! (soft piano music) (knocking on door) (soft piano music) Yes? - Good afternoon, Mrs. Luna. I'm Detective Calderon. May I come in please? - Oh sure, absolutely, come on in. - Thank you. - Here, have a seat. (coffee pouring) - Thank you. - You're welcome. - The funeral home wanted a photo of Ray for the obituary in the newspaper, so. I haven't had the heart to put them all away yet. So what can I do for you, Detective? - I wanted to tell you that we believe we caught the man who killed your husband. - Wait. You believe? So you mean you're not sure? So you have nobody in custody? - We received a call of a man wearing the same kind of clothes and matching the description in the sketch that you provided. - But you haven't seen him yourself? - No, ma'am. - And did you find my husband's wallet? Did you find the knife that killed my husband? - No, ma'am. But we are confident that this is the man. So I wanted to personally come by and let you know that you and your daughters are safe now. (Teri scoffing) - Detective, have you ever seen someone that you love die right in front of you? Have you ever seen their soul leave their eyes? Do you know what that feels like? - Yes, ma'am. I do. I better go. - Unless, unless you can come here and tell me that you found my husband's killer, get outta my house! - I didn't mean to upset-- - Get out! Shut up! Get out! Don't you ever come here again, ever! Ever! You've done nothing, you sorry ass cop!

(Teri crying) (soft suspenseful music) (Teri gasping) What happened? (soft suspenseful music) (music stops) - You okay? - Yeah, I'm sorry. I just have a lot on my mind right now. I need to talk to you about something. Like, a serious talk. - You're not gonna yell at me, are you? - No. I just don't want you to freak out, okay? - Well telling me not to freak out is kinda making me want to freak out. What's going on? - It's just that I'm pregnant. - What? And it's mine? - Of course, I haven't been with anyone else. - Shit. - What are you thinking? - Um. I'm gonna be a dad. I'm gonna be a motherfucking dad. - Whoa, don't get too excited. I don't even know if I'm gonna keep it yet. With everything going on, I don't know if I can handle a baby. - Listen, I know you've been through so much this week, so whatever you decide, I completely support your decision. I love you. - I love you too. I'm so relieved. I ... I was worried about how you were gonna take it. - No, babe, you're never in this alone. And, if you decide to keep it, we can name the baby little Mitchie Junior. - Oh (laughs). - Or, Michelle, if it's a girl. (Cassie laughing) See what I did there? - Yeah, you're definitely not naming the baby. - Have you told your mom yet? - No. It's the last thing she needs to hear right now. - How's she doing? - I honestly don't know. I think she's just putting on a brave face for us. It's only been a week. I'm just scared how she's gonna react to this news. I'm gonna tell her after the funeral. - And do you know when that is yet? - I don't know. I told her to wait until she's better. She's still in a lotta pain. - And you? How have you been? - I'm just still processing that I don't have a dad anymore. Like, it doesn't feel real and I just wanna curl up in a ball and cry all the time, but I can't because I have to be strong for my mom and for Denise. And it's gonna be really hard if we decide to keep the baby. - How do you mean? - My dad would have been an awesome grandpa, and now that's never gonna happen. - Babe, no, that's why we have pictures, and videos and memories that we can share. Make sure that he isn't ever forgotten. - Thank you so much for being so wonderful. Can we go get that burger now? I'm starving. - Yeah, but one more thing. - What? - Do you think a quickie would hurt the baby? - Seriously? - Hey, I had to try. Fine. Let's go. (shower draining) - Ho. (Teri exhaling) (Teri sniffing) Oh. (hand squeaking) (door creaking) Hm. (hand squeaking) (throat clearing) (pills rattling) (water running) (bells tinkling) Oh, Lizzie. Hm. (soft suspenseful music) Okay, Ray. I can't believe I'm gonna do this. But I need to talk to you, so. Let me see what, what this is all about. The rules of the spirit world are simple. Be polite, keep it simple, and be careful what you wish for. (Teri exhaling) Place your index fingers and middle fingers on the planchette. To wake the board up and prepare for its use, slowly move the planchette in circles. Concentrate on what you want to ask and speak in a clear, loud tone. It may take several attempts to reach a spirit. When you've finished using the powers of the spirit board, you must close the portal on the other side by saying goodbye. (Teri exhaling) (Teri exhaling) Okay. My fingers, and go in small circles. (soft suspenseful music) And be clear. Ray? Baby, if you can hear me, say something. Show me a sign, anything. (soft suspenseful music) (Teri sighing) Okay. Okay. Ray. Ray, I'm serious. Please. Please come to me. (door creaking) Ray? (soft piano music) Ray? Honey? Honey, it's, it's Teri, honey. I called you.

Ray, tell me what to do! (door opening) (soft suspenseful music) (door closing) (soft suspenseful music) (file tapping) - Do you know why you're here? (scoffing) You were seen by witnesses at the scene of a crime where a man was stabbed to death. Look at me when I'm talking to you! (soft suspenseful music) As a matter of fact, the description matches the clothes you're wearing. And I'm sure that stain on your shirt would match Mr. Luna's blood. - (chuckles) Man. I found these clothes. - No, I don't believe you. Where were you a week ago tonight? - I aint saying shit. I know my rights. I'm innocent. This don't even look like me. Are you blind? - Okay. - Are you blind? My face isn't all fucked up. - You're under arrest for the murder of-- - I didn't do it! (soft suspenseful music) (gentle music) - What the hell? Cassie!

Ray, it was horrible. He was chasing me. He's in the house. - Sh, sh sh, sh sh. It's all going to be okay now. Nobody's going to hurt you. - I have dreamt of this moment where you would comfort me and tell me everything is gonna be okay. I begged God to let you come. - I've wanted to come before, but I couldn't until tonight. I don't know what you did, but it's allowed me to visit you. (soft piano music) - Ray? What does it feel like to be dead? I mean, is it wonderful like we thought? Or is it scary? - It's not like anything at all and everything else all at once. It's a feeling. Have you ever just about fallen asleep and you feel like you're falling down a long, long well? - Yeah. - It's like that. Except it never ends. And you don't know where you're falling to or where you're falling from. You're just there. It's lonely but crowded. It's not like anything I thought it would be or what it's made out to be. Death is really just death. The only difference is, it's not totally lights out. You're still aware of the nothingness. - Ray. I'm so sorry. - Teri, my time here is limited. - Limited? No, you cannot leave me again, please. - Let's not waste our time being caught up in our sorrow and celebrate the fact that we are here now. Together. If I'm not mistaken, it's still our anniversary. - You remember. - How could I forget the happiest day of my life? - Mine too, Ray, mine too.

She needs me. What if she got into trouble? - I'm sure everything is fine. - Oh, got it. Oh my God. - What is it? - She called. She called me, and I didn't answer. Oh my God, Mitch, what if she's hurt? - She was probably just checking up on you? - God, I'm so stupid. I never shoulda left her alone. I knew better. I need to call her.

I just, I have a bad feeling. She's not that heavy of a sleeper. The ringer should wake her. I don't know. I have a bad feeling. Take me home please. I think something happened. - All right.

Give me a kiss (laughs). (phone ringing) - Help me. Help me! - That isn't how phones work. - [Recording] Hello, hello, this is the Luna residence. We're not at home right now and so sad we missed your call. Please leave your name and number, and we'll try to get back to you as soon as we can. Bye. - [Cassie] Mom, if you can hear me, I've been trying to call your cell. - I can hear you. - [Cassie] Is everything all right? Call me back as soon as you get this. I'm on my way home. - No! No! Cassie, stay away! Cassie, don't come home. Don't come home please. - Hear that? Our baby girl is finally coming home to us. The four of us can be together as a family, just like you wanted, huh, Teri? This is what you've been praying for. - Shut the fuck up already! Shut the fuck up! - I can hardly wait to get my hands on our sweet daughter and that baby growing inside of her. - That what? - Oh, she didn't tell you? She's a slut! - Stop that! You stop putting words in his mouth! Don't you dare! - Mm. That body. Just beckons for me to have my way with it (laughs). - You sick fuck! Oh!

I know something is wrong. This isn't like her, Mitch. She used to say all the time that she could never fall asleep until she knew I was home. A part of her was always awake, even if her eyes were closed. Tonight wouldn't be any different. - Don't get yourself all worked up. It isn't good for you. Or the baby. God knows you've been through enough this week. That's it. This is all just the weight of the week crashing down on you, and on her. She's probably just asleep. And that's good for her. - It's too late to tell me not to get upset. You know, she wanted to have dinner because it was their anniversary tonight. She wanted me outta the house. What if? - What? Oh, no. Cassie, you can't think like that. That, that man wouldn't ... - What if he found us, Mitch? What if he broke in and did something to her? What if, what if she tried calling and I didn't pick up? - No. No. It has to be something else. - Just hurry, okay? (sirens blaring in distance) (Teri groaning) (soft suspenseful music) (lightning striking) (zombie laughing) (lightning striking) - (whimpers) Oh. (zombie laughing) (soft suspenseful music) (blood spattering) (zombie growling) (foot thudding) (soft suspenseful music) - Where's the planchette? Oh my God. (soft dramatic music) (zombie growling) (Teri screaming) - Goodbye! (dramatic music) (Teri breathing hard) - Mom! - Cassie! - Honey. Honey, I need you. I need your help. Cassie, help me! - Mom! - Please! - Mom, what the hell happened? Oh my God. Mom, you're bleeding. Oh my God. Where does it hurt? Be careful. What happened? - I can't explain, honey, right now. - Did you hurt yourself, Mom? - Yeah. Honey, call the police. - Okay. - And call me an ambulance. (zombie growling) (blows thudding) (Teri screaming) - No! No! (crickets chirping) - Come on, Cassie. (phone dialing) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) (soft suspenseful music) (phone clicking) (soft suspenseful music) (zombie growling) (Teri and Cassie screaming) (dramatic music) (Teri and Cassie panicking) (soft suspenseful music) (zombie growling) (Teri and Cassie panicking) - Mom, Mom! Hold on to me! Please hold on to me! - No, you can't have my daughter! You can't have her! Fuck you! (Teri and Cassie panicking) Cassie, hold on to me! (both shouting) (blow thudding) (dramatic music) (Teri screaming) (zombie growling) (Teri screaming) What did you do to her? What did you do to her? Cassie! (Teri crying) No. No! Come here. Cassie, get up, get up, get up! Get up, get up! (crickets chirping) (car door closing) (engine starting) Oh sweet girl. Cassie. Cassie, I need you to find Daddy for me. (soft suspenseful music) I need you to find Daddy. Oh my God. (Teri crying) (Teri wailing) (soft music) (Teri crying) (soft suspenseful music) (Teri crying) (soft suspenseful music) - Stay away from me! - Teri, please listen to me. It's me. It's really me this time, I promise. It's Ray. - You're trying to trick me again. It won't work. It won't work. - This isn't a trick. I managed to get away, but I don't have much time. It'll find me. - But, how do I know it's really you, Ray? Who will find you? What is it? - Abilash. - What? What are you talking about? - I came to tell you the truth. It's the only way I know how to save you. This is all my fault. - No. No, Ray. You can't blame yourself (sniffs). - Listen to me. Do you remember the first day we met? You hated me. You wanted nothing to do with me. I must have asked you out a dozen times, and every single time you said no. - No. That isn't right, Ray. - It is, my love. (soft suspenseful music) - I don't understand. I don't understand. - I went to see someone. Someone who can help with these kinds of things. (crickets chirping) (soft mysterious music) - Welcome. I've been expecting you. - You have? - Of course. - I don't even know what I'm doing here. - Yes, you do. What is her name? - Whose name? - The woman you are in love with. That is why you are here, no? - It's, uh, it's Teri. - Ah. Teri. And she does not love you back? - No. - But you want her to? - I know that's not possible. - Nothing is impossible, my new friend. Have you heard of Abilash? No, of course not. Abilash is a hell hound, a fallen angel. A forsaken beast we usually do not mettle with. - Then why are you telling me this? - Because, what you desire can only be obtained with the help of Abilash. (soft mysterious music) This is what you came for. (soft mysterious music) - It's uh ... It's a toy. - (laughs) No, my friend. This is Abilash. He is trapped in here. (soft mysterious music) And as long as he is, whoever possesses the board has complete control over him. (soft mysterious music) He will make your deepest desires come true. A wish maker. He will make sure that Teri falls madly in love with you. - How much is this gonna cost? - There is no cost. Only one condition. - What? - You must never, ever, under any circumstances, let the glass eye in the planchette break. If it does, you, my new friend and everyone in your life will be in grave danger. Do you understand? - I do. - Then let his powers flow through you. By accepting this gift, from Zaheer. (soft mysterious music) - Everything was perfect. We had 20 wonderful years together, didn't we? Two daughters. And then it happened. (soft suspenseful music) (board scraping) (soft suspenseful music) (fingernails scratching) - [Teri] Ray? (glass breaking) (soft suspenseful music) - I broke it, Teri. I unleashed it on us. - You're a murderer, Ray. Do you know that? You killed our baby! And you lied! For 20 years, you lied to me! It's all on you, Ray! It's all your fault, Ray! - I'm so sorry. - Don't you touch me! - Teri, please. - Just stop! Just stop! Can't you see? Can't you see how selfish you've been? What if we were never meant to be together? It's all one big, fat lie! - No, don't say that. I've tried to make this all right. It has a hold on my soul. I'm trapped, Teri. Trapped in its grip. But the doll. I was able to move Lizzie when I could to help you. That was me. Don't you see, I never wanted any of this to happen? - I want you gone, Ray! I want you gone for good! - Teri. (Teri whimpering) (Teri groaning) - The sun will be out soon, and our time together will end. I know you don't have much time to live. That is what's keeping me. Why don't you just give up, Teri? And be with your family forever? Join me now. - [Zombie] Mom, where are you? It's so dark, and I'm so scared. I need you, Mom. Me and my baby need you. (Abilash laughing) (baby crying) - No! It's not gonna end this way! (soft suspenseful music) (Teri breathing hard) Honey, I'm so sorry. I love you. (Teri grunting) (Teri breathing hard) (Teri grunting) (body thudding) Oh. (Teri panicking) (Teri screaming) (Teri screaming) (Teri gagging) (Teri wailing) (soft suspenseful music) (Teri panicking) (Teri breathing hard) (Teri crying) (soft suspenseful music) I made it. (Teri screaming) (body crashing) (soft suspenseful music) (knocking on door) - Hello? Hello. Anybody here? Hello? Mrs. Luna? It's Detective Calderon, Valley View PD. Are you here? Hello? Hello. Police, anybody here? (soft suspenseful music) Anybody here? Hello? Make yourselves known. Valley View PD. Come on out. (soft suspenseful music) Come out. Police. I know you're up there. Come on out. Make yourselves known. (soft suspenseful music) (door creaking) (soft suspenseful music) - Mom? Cassie? Where are you guys?
