- [Voiceover] What the fuck you gone do besides pimp? - [Filmore Slim] If you live by the code, you die by the code, you know? Pimp or die, it don't stop till the casket drop. And all these young people out there, you understand me, look up to Virgil Fairley. They say, "Give him a big thumbs up, "'cause he's doing it. That's brother's doing it, Jack!" - What's happening? It's your boy, Dollar, man. Down here in Fresno, California, kicking it with my uncle, Virgil Fairley, shooting this documentary. One of the all-time greats, players in the game, man. - He was all fly and shit. He'd jump out his Cadillac, he was clean as a bitch! - I bought him a Rolls Royce in 30 days. And Virgil was pimping on me, cold, chilly blood. Cold, chilly, blood. His pimping was strict. * And have a bitch's head and keep her ass on the grind * Ass on the line just to see her daddy smile today * Jewelry blinging you can see me from a mile away * Get a quarter before it's over, she better find a way * Or she'll be sleeping on the corner * I ain't got time to play * No dummy, this ho money for sho' money * Step to me and you'll get beat like you stole from me * I want riches I want fame * 'Cause I'm laced with so much game * So no matter what I do - You are a living legend, in the game. And you are only of the only brothers that they seen in met that came in 1963 and still been able to put in real large in 2013. It's kind of unheard of. - You gone see Virgil and everybody in the car with a hat tilt to the side. They gone have diamonds and gold on just like they got now. And people just actually pulled to the side and watched Virgil and 'nem drive down the street. (chattering) - You know, because I done been involved. I done been in LA, I been in Vegas. I've been in Frisco with Virg, and I mean, you know, you can't be scared if you want to go somewhere. You always wanna go where it's at. And Virg will take you there. You can see, you can see that Virg will take you somewhere if you just listen. - Virgil has always been an inspiration in our lives as we coming up in the game. - If Virgil was still in the life, I would definitely choose up with someone like that. Very well rounded, amazing person, so. For sure, that's the main choice. (chattering) (soulful piano music) - I met my nigga Virgil in the early 80s. This nigga had my sister, Shirley, his main bitch. All right, check this out. A lot of these niggas been coming through here tonight popping this bullshit, but I know it's a whole lot of niggas that's been hating. So, I'm here to clear the motherfucking record about a whole lot of shit. - I was raised up in a family of six. And my mother and father worked real hard for a living to take care of all her kids. And you know back during that time people wasn't really educated. So, all they had to do was depend on field work or some kind of hard construction job or, or even if you had a job. If you didn't have a job, you're on welfare, you know, living poor, under poverty. So, as I went to school-- You know my mother raised us real good to be just them two working and all six kids. So, I just about had everything I ever wanted in life. My mother took real good care of me. So, as I got older, I didn't really like to work because the only thing I seen in the ideal of work was that manual labor that wasn't getting no money. I didn't see no progress out of anything that none of my friends and things was doing in life. So, when I got into like 15, 16 years old, I wanted to be a grown man. I started feeling my, you know? So, grown man did what grown people do, go to work! (laughter) Something I didn't want to do. So, anyway, I picked a job that I like doing, like pitching watermelon and stuff of that nature. But then on the weekend my mother wanted me to go cut some grapes, pick cotton, that was a no-no for me. Every time I hit a field, I'll get fired, 'cause I just, that wasn't my thing, picking no cotton and cutting grapes. But is really wasn't nothing else to do in Fresno, where you was raised up at. - [Voiceover] Right. - [Virgil] But anyway, I was kind of smart in school. So, I went to the test for the city when I turned 17, 18 years old. 'Cause I wanted some things that I-- You know, a new car. Passed the test, went to work. Went and passed another test, went to work. Next thing I know I'm fired from both jobs. 'Cause I had two jobs! (laughter) I guess they trying to spread 'em out for everybody. So, I had just bought me a new Cadillac, I was like 17, 18 years old. Onliest youngster in Fresno had a new Cadillac. So, I'm riding down Fresno Street, trying to think what could happen, what I'm gone do next, I gotta pay for my car now. So, some lights start blinking off and on. And it's some girls I went to school with that was in the game, right? So, she asked could she ride with me. I said, "Yeah, come on." So them was two hos. So the other girl started hunching the other girl talking about how nice looking I was, you know, how fine, "Oh wee, I like him." So, I went from there. I dropped one girl off and the other girl chose me that night. And it was no looking back. That's what got me into the game. - When he was 13 years old, he sold me pots and pans in Fresno, at the ho's motel, called "Motel Row." Sold me hot plates to feed my women. 'Cause I had about nine motel rooms. So, this little boy came and knocked on my door and he say, "OG" you know, "Pimpie" he say, "You want to buy some pots and pans for your girls?" He didn't know nothing about hos, he said, "girls", okay? So, I said, "Yeah." So, he sold me pots and pans. And I watched him grow up. I watched Virgil grow up, now. Billy Edwards, okay, Dave Spirlot, okay, Brougham Earl, Benny Pace, that's Fresno. That's the players in Fresno, okay? Virgil came up under these people. Virgil was the youngest player that come out of Fresno, although he put Fresno on the map. Now, Virgil was taught by a old-school player that turned Virgil out was named Milton Peters. - A guy by the name of Foots and Milton Peters, those the guys that I really looked up to as a kid, and pattern my style after as far as getting money, and being a big giant in the game. Thinking they kind of really fascinated me. So, he pulled me to the curb and said, "You got five or six ladies." He said, "but what you gone do when they run off?" Well, at this time I thought my game was good, and you know, they was in it to win it and there to stay. - He invited me out there to Charlotte with the turnaround driveway out there when he had the house. He said, "Man, I don't even invite many "people coming to my houses, "it's something about you, Black, I like." And we've been hanging tough, 81! No, 80 when I first came through there. I was on my way to Albuquerque. Get us some (mumbles), he said, "Man, where you going?" I had a couple of white girls in the car. He said, "Where you going?" I said, "Man, I don't stay in California, man. "I go everywhere, I chase money. "If they tell me they selling pussy in Africa, "I'll try to get over there, man." - Yeah, this is San Pablo and 35th. Right here is the California Hotel where some of the famous players in the world have came. And this is where it all started from with me, right here. We go all the way back to the 50s. From here to Seventh Street, all this was my turf here. All down San Pablo. Three or four blocks around all around, all the way up to MacArthur's. - [Black] Hos used to work all the way down there. They used to work all the way to MacArthur, right here, all the way down this side of the street. I mean, it was lined up with hos, man. - I always knew one thing, the bigger the city, the bigger the money. So, that's why I tried to climb to the mountain top. When I see there's a bigger city, here I come. - [Black] (laughter) That's right. That's where all the money was. One of the most famous hotels in town at one time. 208 was my room. - [Black] Checked money out this room, man! - I used to stay close to the door just in case I had to get away, I can get away. You got the key to come in? - [Black] It should be open. - Hold on, Tito. This is how it look now. - [Black] They remodeled it though. And right here, you could stand in this motherfucker and look right down on your ho, man. Right down on this road. - Where I parked my car right, Jack. and look right down on my brand new Eldorado. - [Black] Let me call you back. But I just don't like to see it dead like this to be truthful with you. - [Virgil] Then I can look right out across the street and see all my girls, all the ladies, walking ladies of the evening. - [Black] All his ladies and all the potential might be ladies. - [Virgil] Especially mine 'cause I wanted to see who was out of pocket. (laughter) Who was in pocket and who was out of pocket. - [Black] This was like a penthouse view on the hos. - If I see one out of pocket from right here, I can move on her. She'd be mindful in the morning. - It don't look right with pimps and hos not walking around here, man. This is where all the hos used to get money up out of these rooms and everything. - [Voiceover] The city of Oakland, California. It was known as pimping, drug-dealers, pimping. In the 1960s and 70s, there were so many pimps in Oakland, that the producer of the most famous pimp movie ever, The Mack, decided Oakland would be the perfect place to film the movie. - That's a true story though, we was at Joe Neal's. Let's see, who was all up in there? JP, Michael Best, you know, Michael Sweets. It was the crew from back in the days, right? AP and they come through Joe Neal's, that's that nigga from Fresno. Virgil was in town, that nigga riding around here. He got big jewelry-- - [Voiceover] Okay, what year was this though, Blue? - This was like 79, 80. Right around in there, you know what I'm saying? And he come to town. I think it was one of those times he was taking a break from that bang, and he come to town and when the news come through that motherfucker Joe Neal's, man, I'm talking about motherfuckers headed up out the door! I'm tripping, 'cause I don't know no whole bunch about Virgil at the time. I had heard about him and everything. But this is when I really get knowledge and wanted to know how he was. That incident there is what made me want to know who is this motherfucker Virgil? Motherfuckers just started easing up out the club. So, when me, Mellow and JP rode through the track, JP dropped me and Mellow off at the car, at the Cougar, we get in the Cougar, and-- no it wasn't a Cougar, it was a Mustang. We get in the Mustang and JP went and picked Marilyn up. And JP had the Marilyn bitch and the white bitch, he went and picked that bitch up. Michael Best went and picked his bitch up. Gary Mack went and picked a white bitch up. It was a few niggas riding up and down the ho stroll with they hos in the motherfucker car. And the only thing that I could see that it was, it was that nigga that was in town with them five or six bitches, with all this big jewelry that was running up and down the track. - He is a role model for in this game and in life. Not just this game but in life. As a man and as a gentleman. And I tip my hat to him. I tip my hat to him. He told me one time he said, something that he can do better than any man. Virgil told me can't no man out lie him to a bitch. (laughter) He said he was the best and he'll challenge any man to out lie, can't no man out lie him from (mumbles). - He coming through in Cadillacs and popping it, pimping, you know. And that was exciting for us but it was not only exciting, but you could eat from it! - [Voiceover] It was a meal, it was a meal. - [Capers] You got the investor in the neighborhood. You got to check out what it is and see if you can eat from this. Everybody can't eat from the game. But Virg taught me how to eat from the game. I ain't ate as much, but I eat. - First ho I had was on this street right here. I took her straight down to Chinatown. And that's where I sit 'em down at. We haven't gotten a chance to see that yet. - [Voiceover] Was she black or white, Virg? - Black girl out of Oakland. That's where I first got my choosing feet, right down in Chinatown. - [Voiceover] Was she with somebody? - Yeah, I had to serve somebody. And now, that's one I got written in my book. - [Voiceover] How he take the news? - He didn't take it to nice. He didn't take it at all. - [Voiceover] So, your first knock was kind of rough? - Well, it wasn't my first knock, but it was with my first lesson. It wasn't rough at all 'cause you know I was standing tall through it all. (chattering) - 14 years old, man, 14 years old, man! That's how we do it in Fresno, California, man. - Fresno, California, man. We making it happen, man! We'll take your money and your bitches up out here, man. For real, man, don't come out here playing man! - We doing it right now in this town! Right now! Fresno, we doing it right now, big! Big shit popping! - [Man in Hat] We got the best in everything. This non-stop out here, man. - [G Money] We got the best of everything. - [Man in Hat] We got the best of everything. Yeah, this Cali's finest right here, man! - It got so foul down in Los Angeles, they came leaving three, four weeks at a time. 30 days at a time, some time three days at a time. I stayed down here about a year. Moved back to Fresno, where my roots was. And I regrouped. Took a few minutes to look at myself and look at my life. Figured out what I had to do next. A friend of mine had moved back named Foots, they call him JB. He pulled me to the curb and said, "You know, you doing real good up in the life. "But it's one thing you missing. "Your profession is pimping but you also need a trade. "You need something to back you up. "And if them hos ever run off and leave "again you got something to hold "you until you catch another one." So, I didn't know what he was talking about at that point. And I had another friend by the name of Player that had the P game and the D game down. That's what everybody was doing, from the old-school. 'Cause they was making sure that they game never, that they life never leaked. So, these youngsters got brainwashed about all I do is drop the P and I don't drop the D. They're the ones that was coming up short and was leaking for months and years at a time. Some of them never did get back. All they was relying on was the name and not the fame. I wanted them both, the name and the fame. So, I learned how to have a profession and a trade and I done it real well. - You got to put it down the way he learned it. Virgil went to that school. Okay, a lot of people say, "Virgil mixed it, Virgil did that." But Virgil put it down the way he learned it. And these OGs taught Virgil how to put it down. And it wasn't about, you a pimp over here, you a dope-dealer over there, it was about the money. - The brother was a legend in himself way before Black from Oakland, Little D, Felix Mitchell. Virgil name rang with Frank Ward, Ted Ward, Willie Ward, the infamous famous macks. The man had sack along with other fellas that rang boss, Roger Gill, Terrible Tom, but Virgil stood out. - This was a nigga right here that know how to get it. That know how to get it out the pussy, and however it is a motherfucker have to get it to get his money. You know, pimping is pimping, nigga! - I'm letting ya' know, this man feed a lot of people, a lot of people! Give everybody a chance! I ain't got nothing bad to say about Virgil. When I was down, when I was coming up in the record business, motherfucker slipped me a couple of dollars, to keep me rolling, this is why Kevin Black got a lot of this artillery up here. It ain't been a rapper I ain't touched. Take that one to the bank. I told him, I said, "Virg, this is the plan. "I'm a try to be the best I can be." Virg said, "Aye-- I remember back in the day, Virg used to have... I hope I'm not telling too much but keep the camera going. (laughter) Virg used to have sacks of money! I'm talking about sacks! I'm talking about real sacks of money. Money rubber banded up, every fucking thing. So, I used to walk in, young nigga, you know, I'm just saying, "What's up Virg, how you doing? "Can you give your little nephew a little something?" He used to tell me, "Don't go in there "and get what you want, go in there "and get what you need!" You see stacks stand up, you don't know what they fuck to take! Don't go in there and get what you want, get what you need! I opened up a sack, shit looked so green in there, I thought I was in the grass playing jump rope. (laughter) He said, "Take what your hands can hold, nigga!" Oh shit, I'm dropping shit going out. That's back in my days, that's how I remember Virgil. - Yeah, I've been knowing Virg all of my life. Ever since Edison High, Tigers for life. So I've been knowing him all my life. He's always been a leader, a leader among men. My friend, my partner, my best friend. Helped me through a lot of crisis in life. * You ain't the working kind of nigga * You needs to keep it pimping * Tell me, what you know about this pimping * It's more than the clothes if I walk with a limp and * Would rather the ho and the money that she getting * She ain't making dollars, she ain't making sense then * Please listen to this game that I'm spitting * - This sign was put here by the Los Angeles Police because it was hos all around here. The tricks would turn the corner every minute on the minute. That sign right there was put there so the tricks had to go all the way out the way and not stop, this used to be the spot. - I got off into the life about 10 years. Did about a 10 year flat in the life. Hey, I done touched down in all the states, I done touched down in Hawaii, Las Vegas, the Bay area, of course, that was my stomping ground, there's where I got my money, got my paper. I was folding paper from the Bay area. Hollywood, California, that's where the fame, took name. As far as Hugh Grant, yeah, I believe I put him on the map in the United States of America. He put me on the map as well, over there in the UK. So, it was vice versa but I think I did more of a, making him a well known actor here in the states, in America, you know? Back when everything had hit the fan, they done made it into a big scandal, well, I was eating before that. We was eating real good, we was driving big Rolls Royces and Cadillacs, and things, and wearing big jewelry and living good before all that. It helped, it helped a big deal. Out of all the time that I've been to jail and I done got popped, that was the most beneficial time that I ever experienced in my life. So, I wouldn't take that back for nothing in the world! - My status, my goals, everything? I want to be a boss bitch. I want to have my own shit and have my own bitches. You know, take the stress of myself so I don't have to do shit, which that's what I'm working for. Eventually, I'll have it. It takes a lot of work, a lot of focus and if you have any outside interference then you will get pulled right back down. So, stay focused, keep your mind on the money and you'll be good. - I never had women to control my kingdom, nothing go through my women. I controlled everything that I done. No women call the shots on me. I call all the shots. They got to know they got a man in they arena. - When I first got in the life, things were totally different. The game has totally changed and girls are different. In Chicago, we run things like nobody solo, we all have a person and you will never catch a solo girl out here doing anything that's worth something. So, we do know that the game is so much different because girls are lazy. We get on our feet and we work. The internet has changed the whole game up. In Chicago we ride in Lexus', Bentleys, Mercedes, BMWs, all that. But there's always the back up guy behind us. He takes care of us 100%. We're loyal, loyal, loyal girls, always. - You know, Virgil was always good to his women from what I saw and what I heard. Matter of fact, one of Virgil's girls went to school with me. We went to high school together and that was his bottom woman. I'd say, that pimp word would be bottom bitch. Okay, that's what they say in the pimp game. And I remember her in high school, and I kind of had a feeling in high school that she was prostituting. But I couldn't put my name on it. But I learned later on that yeah, she was out there prostituting for Virgil and this was when I was in high school. And when I got out of high school, Virgil was still pimping her, and when I became a police officer. So, he had that girl for a long time. I mean it was maybe 8, 9 years he had this girl and he had her out on the street working for him I don't know but I heard that her momma was working too. So, Virgil might of had her momma out there working too! (laughter) - I never would have got with Virgil because I had a girlfriend that dealt with Virgil and so therefore, no questions, no, I wouldn't have done that because my homegirl dealt with him and things of that nature. So, that would have been out of the question. He's a fly cat to me, he do his thing so... He just a cool buddy of mine. I would have never made that suggestion 'cause me and my homegirl, we best of friends, we tight like that and it never would have came across paths with me and old Virg. - I've been in the game a long time. I never considered myself, using a title as pimp. I have them call me by my name. Because it's a lot of versions when it come to pimp. Control of your kingdom. They say a lot of different other things about a pimp that I really don't want to say, because it's a whole lot of people who got different meanings of where "pimp" come from. I'm a mack and a player. That's how I get down. I don't even use the term, "pimp" when it come to me. I'm a shaker and a mover and a money handler. Do I send women to work? Have I sent women to work? Yes, I have. Have I been 12, 15, 17 deep? Yes I have, but I still didn't use that word because nobody know the true meaning of it. They just use that word because it sound cute to use. To each his own, like I say, you can... If it make you feel good, if it sound good, it's all good. But it's a million ways to get to the top, just as long as you get there shaking hands with the ones that's at the top but you can only count at the top. How many people really do get to the top? - Hi, my name is Baby Doll. - Hi, my name is Lollipop. - Hi, my name is Tipsy. - Hi, my name is Charming. - [All Ladies] And we're Virgil's Angels. - A real pimp, he'll sell his self, but a mack ain't gone do it, he gone get it the best way he know how. And that's one way, get it! Virgil rang through Frisco, Oakland, Bay area, Grey Girls, Sisters, Asians, and his name rang real, very credible in the street. - We ain't get knocked. I can damn near count on one hand how many times I got knocked. - It's hard to knock me, hard! See, my game started from the bedroom. That's where I done all my pimping from. Once I get in baby's ear and I get ready to send her out that front door, and she goes and hits the track, it's hard to get me. - I tell motherfuckers "from the sheets to the streets." - No doubt about that. (laughs) From the sheets to the streets. - From the sheets to the streets, man. - A lot of niggas just send a woman out the door with no-- - Instructions, at all! - And what she gone do? Listen to what nothing but hos tell her. And they gone give her mixed up instructions. - So, I learned how to have a profession and a trade, and I done it real well. So, I make sure I put myself in position not to ever get in bad shape ever again. One time was too much for me. I didn't even like the feeling of not being able to and I like to do as I please. So, I took the ball and ran with it took it to a professional level. And the onliest thing that can stop me is the chase or making a mistake or slips or whatever it might have been. So, I mastered the game for a long, long time. Sure it's in everybody-- Slips don't count until you fall. So, everybody gonna slip but as long as you don't fall down, you all right. - I was a police officer, I knew all the major players on the street. I knew the big boys and by knowing them you hear things that happened to other hustlers, I refer to them as hustlers because they didn't have a job. They job was the streets and they hustled their income. One thing in particular that stood with me that another hustler told me about Virgil, I didn't participate in it but I heard this from another hustler, who later was shot and killed, that always intrigued me about Virgil, there was three major players on the street that intrigued me. They were kind, they were always overdressed, and when I say overdressed, most people dress up when they go out to party or have a good time. Every day on the streets was a party for Virgil and his cronies. You'd see a convertible Eldorado Cadillac coming down the street with the top down, you gone see Virgil and everybody in the car with a hat tilt to the side. They gone have diamonds and gold on just like they got now. And people just actually pulled to the side and watched Virgil and 'nem drive down the street. - I lived next door to the highway patrolman. I got the school teacher on this side. And everybody was at the window. And here comes this long, old, Zimmer car coming up the street, okay? You can't even see over the hood of it, okay. And here come Virgil and everybody is watching him like, "Who is this?" But he'd pull up in my driveway told me to open the garage. I'd hit the garage button and put half of the car in there, 'cause the other half wouldn't go in. So, the rest of it was sitting in the street. And this drawed a big crowd of people. So, they wanted to know who Virgil was. I said, "Well, he's my personal friend." Virgil went out, I told him to come in the house, he say, "I told you to come on and go with me." He say, "Go out there and pop the trunk. "Here the keys," you know, 'cause my girl was fixing him a plate of food. "Go out there and pop the trunk and get what you need. "Get all you can get." I went out there and popped the trunk. Virgil had a bale of money, okay? Just like hay for a horse, right? He had a bale of money in the trunk of that car. And he said, "Get all you can, fill up all your pockets." And I was grabbing. I was grabbing money. I was putting money everywhere I could. You understand me? And he said, "But you can't use no bag or no sack, "just all you can put in your pocket." So, I had all my pockets, I was putting money in there. I come in there looking like, hey, I had so much money in my pocket. He said, "Now, that's what you would have had, "if you would have went with me!" - When you see Virgil and his boys riding in the car together, they would wear what we call "Godfather Hats," and they would lean to the side like this, and you knew that that was Virgil and his boys because they thought they was clean, which they were clean 'cause they was-- we called it, they were "styling" then. - One particular time I saw Virgil and a counterpart of his come through Chinatown. I was walking the beat. And you knew when Virgil was in town, out of town, because the people on the street, they responded to it, and you could see the people on the street in Chinatown. They would all move to the side on F Street. You knew somebody important was coming. They moved to the east side of the street, so they could watch the show. And about five minutes later, me and my partner was standing on the corner and we say all the girls move to the side, we knew somebody was coming through. And it was Virgil driving and his counterpart. They were the biggest hustlers in Fresno at that time. A week or so later, I saw Virgil come back through Fresno, through F Street in Chinatown. They were so clean that I think even police officers wanted to take a picture of him 'cause (laughter) we used to admire the way they was dressed. You know, we had the blue on, the blue hat. They come in with white Kangol hats and three-piece-suits. They had walking suits back then. Every thing was white, every thing blue, every thing was pink and then all the gold and diamonds showing. And you know, I felt that sometimes I should have been protecting them so they wouldn't get robbed. (laughter) But one story in particular, I'm a get back to that, is that I heard Virgil got busted and the police department in those days, you knew every thing about every body. But you couldn't take it out of headquarters. And we heard that Virgil was one of the only Blacks at that time, that the Mafia would deal with. This is what we heard through other hustlers. And these were top dogs, when I say, "top dogs," they didn't deal with 5,000, 10,000, $20,000 sales. They made purchases, you know, big purchases, bundle purchases, moved bundles of drugs. - [Voiceover] Get some of that. * ABCG, anybody can get, anybody can get it * Anybody can get it * ABCG anybody can get it, anybody can get it * Anybody can get it * I'm a boss, know what I mean * You getting money, you do the damn thing * You got goons, I do too * Make a move, whatever you want to do * Anybody can get it * Yeah, I don't say much * The money speaks on its own * Got you hungry niggas wishing I was home alone * Familiar to it all throwing these sticks and stones * But it's known you fuck with mine * I'll leave your torso gone * A beast in the streets * (mumbles) * Attack me on a fucking song * I'm coming for your fucking dome * I rock with Crips, I rock with Bloods * Nortes and Eses all show me love * - But when I was coming up into the life, people that was dealing with hos dealt with drugs too. They all was surrounded by one little circle. It's all in the game. The most easiest and safest, simplest thing was talking a woman into going to get those two and fews. But when it come to the drug game, those twos and fews came into threes and fours, and five and sixes. That's what makes the money bigger. You can send a woman to work, she might not even break luck that night. All your money getting ready to be limited. But when you handling something that a person got to have, they gone think of any means necessary to go and get that money, and they gone spend that money on what they need. - Virgil was first introduced to me through I would say, my OG Bianca. She was explaining to me about her past and the type of lifestyle she lived, and Virgil was a big aspect in her life. Everything I heard was positive. Nothing negative, everything was positive from the way that he treated his hos, to the way that he just treated people in general. - Riverside, Oceanside, I've heard his name for years. Virgil would flip his cars every year. And so was his girls', and that impressed me. Because I was getting money, but I couldn't figure out how they were getting that kind of money and able to flip a car every year. - Virgil put me in a position where I was rubbing elbows with millionaires. And I used to get so much money. I don't think that he ever had a lady of leisure that made money like me, 'cause I got Rolls Royce money. I got white girl money. Like I'll out-check 50 white girls, because I had flavor, I could be any color that I wanted, I would be Samoan. I could color my hair blonde, I'd be any nationality that he wanted me to be. So, we really, we got big money! - I heard about Virgil when Tina would tell me she was with this guy, Virgil, back in the days. I just finally had the pleasure of meeting him. I met her when I moved to Atlanta. I worked at Magic City, I worked at Pin Ups. And I worked at Dirty Reds. Those were my main clubs in Atlanta, and I worked there, I made like 1000 a night. And sometimes your feet hurt, and you just want to get some flat backing. So that's what I did. - And during that time, the Black Panthers were extorting a lot of brothers in the street with their revolutionary stuff of, "You got to give something back to the hood." And he was one of the brothers that they didn't get at like that. So, if you know what I mean, if they didn't get at you like that, that mean that he ain't to be played with. - You can draw your conclusion on the one little thing, but that one thing can cover a million miles. It could be one dot. That's where your mathematics come from. The whole world is built on mathematics. If you're able to figure your problems out, you're able to figure out what the world is doing. The whole world is about money, making money. They have less morals about themselves than I do. A lot of things I won't do for money. You got cops killing people for money. They work every day, get trained to kill, and that's what they go out and do. Right or wrong. I would not do that for money. That's where my morals step in. I would not steal nothing for money. I'm a player, I ask for mine. I don't abuse nobody for money. I don't misuse people for money. So, that's where my morals step in. - He's better than me because I don't have the patience for it. I can only tolerate so much. You can only train a bitch to do so much and at the end of the day, he's been doing this for so many years, obviously it come natural to him. But every thing I've heard about him has been positive. - My sister was one of the best, I think at pickpocketing, she used to work with her fingers and her toes. I never mastered that, I wish I could have. But I never mastered it but she was a good girl. She was also a trouble-maker though. She was spoiled, she was jealous. So she was quite a trouble-maker for Virgil. - Again, I've heard a lot of information about Virgil being involved in the pimp game, drugs, drug activity. I used to walk the beat in Chinatown. And two officers would walk the beat in Chinatown and Virg's girls would work the street. We would have to stop and talk to some of these girls. When we stopped and talked to them, we had a little black book. And in our little black book, we would write down the girl's name, and the reason why we would write down the girl's name because some of these girls would rob the johns. The johns would go into a room with them and rob 'em. And then we'd go through our little black book. "Oh, this is so and so. "Her pimp is Virgil Fairley." - Yeah, we on our way down to where I got arrested at. And I had never had a case before in my life. I had been charged with a lot of things, railroaded, police lied on me and did all type of things to railroad me but, that's what caused them to take all my toys and money and jewelry, minks and furniture and houses. They did that a few times. So, they put me in a position where I had to work double hard to get back. - One of his buddies in Beverly Hills, we raided them from Fresno, a task force about 40 of us, top dog brother. We busted him, we went in his house, he had two bales of cocaine. We confiscated the two safes that he had. We took his safes. Opened 'em up he had two and a half million dollars. Virgil name and two other guys, players in Fresno name was in the safe, and that's when they started tracking him. * I got my money on my mind - [Voiceover] The Sacramento Police and the FBI came together and arrested Ray Virgil Fairley, the morning of November 19, 1992. They raided four of his houses, and confiscated over a million dollars in cash, jewelry, mink coats, exotic cars, that included Rolls Royce, Golden Spirit Zimmer, Mercedes Benz, and 17 other cars were put on trucks and towed away. When Virgil went to trial, everyone in Sacramento's law enforcement came to court to see who was this kingpin was, the mystery man, the man that was never on their bust list, the one that almost got away. - I come up out of there, that's the worst thing that could have happened, this is the jail, here. That was the courthouse, this was first courthouse here. And the jails was all upstairs there. That's where I learned I shouldn't have done, handled my business certain ways, take certain chances, put myself in certain positions I should have been in. I learned a whole lot 'cause a whole lot of people there was just like me. - Yeah, that's the big yard right there, administration building, that's the big yard, right there. Big white part. The gym right there. - [Voiceover] How much time you do over there? - I did a couple of years over there. But that was back in the day though. And motherfuckers used to come by on they boats, man. And broads would show they titties and shit. And I'd be like, damn, one day, one day! (laughter) One day, that's gone be me! (laughter) - [Voiceover] Now, here you are! Now, here I am, Jamie, show your titties. (laughter) * With all that pussy popping girl * Girl, with all that pussy popping * Big O, we love that pussy popping * It's pretty simple, big booty Judy * Over cutie-patootie with tiggle biggles * Her bottom booty, snooty booty * With pretty dimples and itty-bitty * Titty committee with pretty nipples * - We had a mutual respect, I knew all of 'em. If you didn't do it in front of me, you could stay on the street. But you can't jeopardize my job by doing something illegal, I got to come get you. - I Always considered myself kind of smooth and smart but you know, but one slip can kill you off. - Okay, I seen him fall five times, and raise back up. I got a friend that fell down and ain't never got back up. They still falling. - I appreciate your struggle, you know, everything you been through. You know, especially the good times. We just gone do the whole movie on the good times. We ain't gone go there. Everybody go through ups and downs, you feel me, but we gone make sure that we-- No, I'm just kidding, but we gone touch on it all, you know what I'm saying? But it's good to be thought of for roles or for characters on guys that really made an impact, where ever they make their impact, however they make their impact, and guys that are still doing it, that are still relevant. And you pay homage to these cats while they're still breathing. You don't do the story afterwards, you feel me? - So by the economy changing that made it triple hard, so if you wasn't on your beat for real or didn't have no knowledge about getting money, you had big problems. You got to know how to adjust to whatever the situation might be. Even if you on top of the world when you go to jail and they take everything from you, you got to learn how to adjust to that. So, everything start from a mental status point. And you got to be strong-willed in order to handle certain situations, either or. You done brought out a whole lot of shit about yourself. But this is what we work for, to have fun, to have money, to have a good time, I invited all my loved ones here. I represent all of my loved one, all my friends, all my pimp friends, and all my associates, I'm representing all of 'em. * I keep my boot in a bitch's ass * So no matter what I do I keep it * - [Voiceover] The title "pimp" started being used in the US around the time slavery ended. It was legal to be a pimp in the Western days. Back in those days, the sheriffs and the marshals of the towns ran the brothels and the prostitutes. They were the biggest pimps in town. - Man, I met Virgil when I was a youngster and then as I grew up, he was somebody that I admired and things because he was a hell of a nigga out in these streets. But now what I want to say about him, when you doing things, and you doing it legit and you getting money legit, after you done been in the game for years, you got to respect that. - I pimped from the 60s to 2000s, for 35 years, I met Virgil in Fresno, pimping back in 77, we've been partners every since. Virgil's been a rich man, ever since I've known him. He's been rich in spirit and rich in the game. We all been rich financially, but some of us keep it, some of us don't. Virgil's been fortunate and he's been blessed, and I wish him much success in life, and may he have longevity and continue to have much success. - I don't advise, my friends ask me all the time if I advise any youngsters to get off into the life, I says, "Nah, I don't advise that." Go to school, get educated. And that's where all your money, and your success and your future is coming from, and I preach that to all the kids. - The smart ones to me is that they'll reach out to a old-school cat that been in the game and they can reach at them and ask them for the knowledge and the old-school cat would give it to 'em. 'Cause they see they trying, they got something but they trying to do and they gone handle they business. - I heard a whole bunch of nice things about you, man. Yeah, I'm from out here too, man. They told me a whole bunch of good game about you. You nice, you look nice too, man. - And he been trying to get lazy man, but now I can't lecture him man. - I'm saying though, what's going on, man, how you it? - [Rob] I'm Rob, his brother, man. - How you doing? I know you! I've seen you around here a lot of times. - Yeah, yeah man, up and down the ho stroll, that's where you seen me at. Touching down for my crown. - Three legends right there, that's JD, Robert, and Virgil, that's Godfather right there. That's the Godfather right there of almighty right there. That's why we here, that's why we here right now. Three legends right there. - [Voiceover] So, tell me how it was growing up with Virg. - Man, it was beautiful. He taught me everything I know. If it wasn't for him, it wouldn't be no (mumbles) in me. (chattering) (laughter) The tip toes to the elbows, you know? That's how it was. He the one put me in my first Cadillac. He told me to, "Take off and go catch you some hos." He raised me up something from Asia wasn't 16, 17 years old. You understand me and, I graduated from him, he clipped my wings, his whole hope I go. - This is my friend Robert here and we've been knowing one another for about 40 years and his big brother has always been an inspiration in our lives, as we coming up in the game. - [Voiceover] Who's his big brother? - Virgil. - Real good pimp. I think a lot of 'em that's here today got some of they pimping from him. So, he's an OG pimp. The original, do it the right way, not the wrong way. That's what I like about him. He don't sell out for a bitch. - [Voiceover] Not just a teacher but a preacher. - A preacher, not just a teacher. He don't sell out for a bitch either. He'll run a bitch till her feet split like deer hooves. (laughter) - Me and Virg go way, man, you understand me? So, I appreciate this fella here, much love, man. Some of the game I got right now, that's where it came from. Real talk, man. That's really real, yeah, so, that's what it is. Real talk, man, love you, man. - [Voiceover] How long you and Virg go back? How long you and Virg go back? - Nigga what? 30? - [Virgil] A long time, 30 years. - Yeah, man, OGs from the town, man. So, yes, this is what we do, man. I'm just glad to be doing it. (chattering) (laughter) - How you doing, man, it's good to meet you man, a legend. (chattering) - They call me the poet, I did a book myself. But this is about Virg. See man, this guy here, he's got fortitude, man. Let me say this here, see it's 25 years to get his mack on wax, his planning on lacing us with these funky track, he has time enough to spit his game back. See, you don't get in this game through an invitation, this is hard work, perseverance and dedication. So all you suckers better stop your faking, 'cause he's got big money (mumbles). See, the world is here and it's just for the taking. See the game is loaded and it's non-stop. Now it's time to give a true pimp his props. True Virgil Fairley, true pimp, believe that. Carvel Rice, straight up poet. My real partner, you know we go all the way back to kids. From kids, yeah. - All the way back from kids-- - All the way back. - And he was here through the whole thing, when it started-- - When it all started. - And to how it is now-- - He took me along with him. (mumbles) - If you ain't real with it, it ain't gone be real with you. - [Man in Red] It ain't gone fall unless (mumbles). - [Virgil] See, deeds and actions is what counts. Conversation don't mean nothing, all the time. Some points it do, but you got to mean what you say. You got to be able to bag it up. If you can't bag it up, ain't no need of stepping up in it. - [Man in Red] Or you gone get slapped on the ass. - Every time. - [Man in Red] If you ain't real in the game, the game gone slap you on your ass. But then you know, it's good for motherfuckers like you to come back out here and give little young motherfuckers like us the game. I'm 30, I've been out here in this whole west side all my life. And you don't have motherfuckers like that that come back and give a motherfucker some good game. I seen this nigga pull up in a motherfucking dream car, nigga, give us little niggas out here motivation. - [Virgil] Inspiration! - [Voiceover] Straight up! - I was like that one time myself. And that's where I got it from, watching the following G and so I pass it on down. And let them know it can be done. - And then you can't be weak neither though. 'Cause you got niggas that got weak game and you got niggas that'll be mad because this nigga got this and this, and you want this so bad, you can't get it to where you looking for me, that's just weak game. You know what I mean? - Just draw a line, say, "You haters get over there. "and let the real stay over here." - Virg, yeah, that nigga showed me so much game as a youngster till it took me over into now. - [Voiceover] The nigga should have been the pope. - Well, not the pope, but the game pope. Okay, I can go with that, Game Pope. * Funky fresh from Oakland, California's * White Collar Records, you understand * We doing it live in this motherfucker * Zoning out in this motherfucker lab, you feel me * We gone let it do what it do * We gone talk to ya', man, we the real talk of the Bay * You understand that you * Bitch, bitch, let's go, let's go * Yeah, talk to 'em * Listen mami let's get right back with it * You feeling love with a player * Thought it fright to admit it * It ain't no hype or gimmicks * Still a flight to my limits * So despite all the attention * Just get right with yo' feelings * Now that I'm playing it's like you quicker to * - Me and Virg, I remember when I was down on my luck up in the Bay area, and Virg treated me just like I was still okay. You know, so, he really helped me get through that moment in my life. And thank God I'm there, he was there for me. So, I owe my life to him, I owe him my life. 'Cause I was really struggling at the time in my life. And he was right there with me. He told me, "Don't worry we gone be all right." - Virg, I've been knowing him ever since I was about five years old. I'm 43 years old. Aye, man, all I know is living legend, man. It is what it is, he stand for everything he say, man. You know, everybody see it, man. They know what it is, man. I ain't got too much to say but it's for real. And we are real, man. - 'Cause that's all he's about the business of keeping up to keeping on, that's why I love him. Always will. - We go way back, we go way back from kids-- - The year would be 1977. And I would say the track was maybe a two-block radius. On the corner was the bar called, "The Triangle." The Triangle Bar, that was the trick bar. That's where everybody congregated at. All the hos, all the tricks. The hotels were like alongside the street. The freeway was on the other side. And it was just this one street. One, G Street, that everybody went down. It was just one block. And it was like 20, 30, 40, 50 hos, pimps riding in and out. It was cool, it was so fucking cool. - I was very naughty and I was out of pocket. I was like doing stuff I didn't supposed to do. And he was gonna beat me up. And so, I was in the car with him, when we got to a stop sign, I jumped out and I took off running. And he had a gopher dude. You know, like one of his lieutenants or something. And Virgil was like, "Chase her, chase her." And I was just running for my life, because he was gonna beat me because I was doing some bad stuff. - It was in the cut, so it was just very, very very country, just that square block radius. Paid many, many, many, many pimps, and many, many hos. And it was just a money getting town. It was a money getting town. Cowboys, Mexicans, truck drivers, business men, bankers, lawyers, doctors, you might date anybody. And it didn't seem like we got bothered a lot. - So it went all the way down. See this is not, back here was a second part where the track used to be. The original track started down here. This is called Chinatown. All this corners provided these streets. Hos, ho'ing. All down through here. When I first got my first blessing. I first started right up in here. That corner where that guy is standing used to be nothing but hos standing there. All around, all around the corners. Where I first sent my first ho down here. Now, it's looking like ghost town. * I put my heart into these songs * Really hoping y'all can feel me * But they ain't really like me, no * - [Voiceover] Fresno is the fifth largest city in California. Before World War II, Fresno had many ethnic neighborhoods. In 1940, Fresno's population, racial make up was 94% White, 3.3% Black and 2.7% Asian. Road props and orchids gave way to urban development after World War II, the population of Fresno soared in the second half of the 20th century. And entered the ranks of the 100th largest United States cities in 1960 with a population of 134,000. But now the paychecks have dried up, along with the farms, thanks to cruel, confluence of drought, environmental regulation, and years of political neglect. The air quality is terrible. Tap water was hazardous. The locals seemed to be mostly behind the times, stuck in the ways that the rest of the country evolved from decades ago. Homelessness and crime is at an all time high. So much that the city of Fresno declared war on the homeless and destroyed the only shelters they had. It is been rumored that land owners have set fires to the homeless shelters to force the homeless from their areas. - What made me really respect him, and know that he was doing large things, he had a house that he had bought. I want to say that it was between San Diego and Los Angeles, in between them. And this house was already laid out, TVs, music stereo, beds, waterbeds, the whole nine yards. See don't nobody really remember this 'cause you know, you had to really be a close friend of his, and if you traveled down the highway, and you didn't have room money or you was close by the house or you called Virg, Virg would tell you how to get to the house and the key stayed under the floor mat of the house and you go in there and live as long as you want to, as long as you need to, and when you leave, after you clean up the house. You put the key back under the mat, and go on about your business. And kind of like when I saw that and heard about it, it was kind of like, wow, that he had a place that he didn't even stay. I don't know what he bought it for, what he did that for, what was the purpose and understanding for that, but it was there for the game and a lot of brothers that knew him, that went down that highway stayed there, lived there and it was open. I mean he ain't nowhere to be found, nowhere around, you know we could have took the TV, the couch, cleaned the whole house out. He was just that generous of a brother that really believed in the game like that there and that's what stuck out in my mind. He done did a lot of great things, but when I saw that, it's like the house was bought for the game and he didn't even stay there. - I know how this nigga was breaking hos. I was his main nigga. I'm going getting these bitches up out of jail. He had this one bitch that I remember in particular, man. And I called him, I said, "V, the bitch is out, what you want me to do?" He said, "Look nigga, the bitch know her way to the track." I told the bitch, "Bitch, you on your own. "Go on about your business." - One year, Virgil called me and he said, "Reggie, you know what day it is?" I said, "Sure, man, it's Thursday." I forgot what the date was, but I said, "It's Thursday, man." And he said, "No, what is today?" I said, "I just got off the train, "it's Thursday evening, man." He said, "Man, it's my birthday." I said," Oh!" And we spent our birthdays together every year. He'd come where I'm at or I'd go where he at. So, I said, "Virgil, I'll be there." He said, "Man, how you gone get here, man? "It's 8:00, man, you can't make it here." I said, "I will be there, Virg." So, I chartered a plane. I chartered a plane and went to Virgil's, and when I got over his house, I had one of them (mumbles) phones in the briefcase. And I called Virgil from the plane. I said, "Virgil, I'm up here." And Virgil came outside and brought the whole party out here and looked up. I said, "Here I am, up here, Virg!" And I'm looking down, and Virg came on. And I could hear him in the background. He said, "That Captain, my goddamn cousin up there." (laughter) You know it was real pimping like that. - The first arithmetic or any time I knew how to count was 'cause the money he put up under my motherfucking mattress, you know what I'm saying? And my mother wanted to go square. And my motherfucking pops told me and my motherfucking momma and I'm a say it on camera, "You quit the game, I didn't." (laughter) "You wanna quit the game and do what you do. "Hell!" - The pimps make hos, man, they can't make us. When a bitch run off, you always got to remember, something better can come along. It was something wrong with that bitch if she wouldn't look up to you. Probably been having trouble with her anyway, I know I was. You know, let that bitch get the fuck on, man. I don't need no headaches. And we left and went on the highway. And when he dropped me off, I come down and he called me, he said, "Your bottom bitch down here ho'ing." I said, "No she not." He said, "Home boy ain't call you?" And he told him, he said, "Man, my partners a real pimp, you need to call him." He said, "Well, I know you got her baby." He said he don't give a fuck about all that, call him. When I come down there, man, he ain't called me yet. I see him on G Street up there by the hotel, I mean, by the gas station. "Hey man, what's going on with you, man? "That bitch you knocked me for, man, what's wrong? "You don't know how to serve a motherfucker?" "Well man, you know, I know you got her baby." "What has that got to do with this pimping?" "Well, I was gone let you know, man." I said, "Listen young man, late news is no news to me. "The last time I sent that bitch out there "as far as I know she was under my instruction "and you ain't told me nothing different. "So guess what, that's why I breaks that bitch." Every time I went down there. And Virg had to bail me out of jail. I kicked the bitch ass all up on the ho stroll. (laughs) Virg had bailed me out. I said, "Virg, I'm in jail." I said, "You caused me, 'cause you told me "that the bitch was still down there, "and you know I ain't gone let nobody disrespect like that." - [Voiceover] Have you ever had a nigga tell you you wasn't gone accept no news? - Oh yeah, oh hell yeah! - [Virgil] I done heard that. - [Black] I had it happen in San Jose, where you was at? It happened in Texas! Them motherfuckers down there don't want to accept news either. - I said, "No problem. "I'll catch you in Australia then." - Yeah, find that bitch. I hope your money is long. - I don't care if you don't accept no news, just let me hear about it. (laughter) - Yeah, that bitch told me-- - No problem. - You know, when we was in San Jose I knocked this motherfucker for hos on Fourth and (mumbles). She said, "He's a fool." And everybody had spoken pretty rough about him. And I said, "Well, you know what, "we're not gone stay here anyway. "You think this is the only motherfucking "ho stroll that cough money? "And then since he's a fool, "is he fool enough to follow your ass across state lines? "Different states? "'Cause I don't stay in no motherfucking "one city and one state." - They come back about 15, 20 years ago. I was up in there, Minnesota on my (mumbles). And you know what, I ain't never had no bad, I ain't never heard no bad word from him. I ain't never heard no bad word about him. He just been a straight up pimp, especially cool. You know what I mean? So, I don't know why these cats running around here, this cat said, "Dude running around hating." They hating for no reason at all, 'cause Virgil, that's the man right there. - We go back to Fresno in about a month 'cause Black need to go. - I want to go check on my car 'cause it was in the garage, it was in the mechanic shop. - Check on some of his business so you know, so I let him take the car. - One of the cars, he ain't gone tell you what car I took though. - Yeah, yeah, he took one of the cars. - I couldn't take the pretty Seville. And I'm glad I didn't, 'cause I was bugging him too. - Yeah, I told him to take the one he wanted. He said, "Well, I'm a take your other car." And I had a black Seville that I just ordered out of Beverly Hills. - With the phantom top, didn't nobody even have 'em yet. He got 'em before they all-- - One in alike in the whole country. This was just like a 1980, 81. So, Black took the car, I gave him the keys and then I took 'em back. (laughs) And then I said, "You better take the other car." - I'm so glad! - So, he took the other, 15 minutes later he called me on the phone and said, he done totaled my car out. - [Black] All the way out! I thought I killed the po' woman. Knocked her all the way up into a liquor store. - I tell Black, "Don't worry about, man, "I'll let that ho, she'll go buy another one." - [Black] You came and picked me up, remember? - I said, "Don't worry about it, she'll buy another one." - He said, "Black, what you gone do about my car?" I said, "Man, you know." He said, "You know what, fuck it! "We gone charge this to that ho, man. "We gone charge it to a ho." I said, "Okay, you gone charge it to a ho, right?" (laughter) I've been holding him to that every time because he talking about, "What we gone do about..." "We charged it to that bitch, man." - So every time I need a deal, I said, "You can't tell me nah,"(laughs) I said, "Remember you tore my car up?" (laughter) - [Black] But we charged it to the bitch. - He's a good guy, he's a boss. If you think about calling somebody the boss, he's the boss. You know, he's a big guy in the game. Good name, good dude. - He had so many keys of dope. And I seen this dude when I went to this soda machine. And I was like, "Why is this guy over here at this hotel?" So, I went back upstairs and told Virgil, I said, "Virgil, I think this guy... "Something's jumping off." I was like, "It's a set up, something. "I'm just not feeling this, Virgil." And Virgil was like just lay down and watch TV. So we sitting there laying down watching TV and I'm like, "Virgil, I'm not feeling this!" And so he was like, "Well, come on." So I went the back way, I got all the dope out the room, put it in my car that he bought me, took it to my apartment, hid it in the room, came back to the hotel. In about three hours later, the battle rams came through, the news cameras, the police. They thought they had Virgil. They were looking so stupid. They took me to jail for a 1/8th of weed. But they winded up letting me go, but it was just hilarious because they thought that they had Virgil Fairley and they didn't. - He was the king at the city. He was the man. Everybody talked about Virgil from Fresno all the way up to the Bay area, down to Riverside, Oceanside. I've heard his name for years, for years. - Virgil is a gentleman. He's a gentleman, I know. I mean and not only is he a gentleman, he's a stand-up gentleman. When you say, "stand-up gentleman", I mean in the terms of just being a man with honor and he has a lot of honor, he has a lot of virtue despite him being in the game. He does. Society per say say the people in the game, that there they're pimps or what have you, that we are somewhat underhand because we don't work jobs like they say we supposed to do and you know, we supposed to be the underdogs. But that's not true at all. It's just the opposite. But what I want to say about Virgil, Virgil's been such a gentleman. He's been a role model to me. - Nothing but inspiration to me. Nothing but inspiration, him and my dad, nothing but inspiration to me. Like I said, you know, everything I got come from the game, everything I got come from the game. No loans from the government, no nothing. Every business I opened come from the game. Me and this man was in business together. This man is nothing but an inspiration to the game, we need more players like that to stand up and stay representing. To show these young cats that it's possible that you can be successful coming out the game. We take ho money and turn it into dough money, and for sure money and it's grow money. You know what I'm saying? And I got the-- Come on, give me some, man. I appreciate everything, I really do I appreciate everything! - His resume, his legacy is pretty powerful being able to do the things that he done, even when he went to lay down and to still come out, still have things, still move forward with it, and still in it and still having things like a 20 year old, it's unbelievable for a brother that's still been able to put it together the way he still do it today. - I've been around the pimp game. I done traveled with the best and the biggest. And I got my game from Gangsta Brown, who got his game from Filmore Slim. And Virgil was a good part of the family, he's a good friend to all of us. He was always good at inviting us always to his events, always willing to include us in everything he do, good dude, good heart, I'm just trying to keep up with him. He told me a long to keep up to catch up. So, I caught up now, I gotta keep up. He got that white girl Royce down there looking real good. Much love to ya', Virg. - Well, Virgil was a special, special, person. You know, he had a special soul. - I've been knowing him all my life. He's been a legend then and a legend now. And I'm honored to give him this kind of compliment. - Virgil from the beginning, he's always been an outstanding, straight up guy as far as I'm concerned. I have nothing bad to say about the brother. He's been real with it. He's been well respected, and definitely embraced. And what I remember most about Virgil, I can recall back on the time when I first met him. It was really on short notice. But from the beginning, I really had a real connection with Virgil. It was just something about the brother. He had that aura about his-self that really enlightened me. It wasn't no bullshit with Virgil, he's just a real dude, you know what I mean? From what I remember. - And I think in retrospect I should have stayed because Virgil has been through a lot of things and he has survived, he's a child of the king, and I should have stayed with him, because I would have been more lucrative and I had to learn the hard way. And you know, live and learn. - When you niggas talk all this shit about my pops, you motherfuckers know that he did his motherfucking thing on every motherfucking level it was. Because you niggas talk about "you got to be straight laced, no chase." You got to pimp the motherfucking situation, nigga! - He always looked after me, he always been my right hand man, I'm a tell y'all something that I shouldn't even say that nobody don't know. Nobody don't really know how close me and Virg really is, Virg had a few incidents, a few misunderstandings with some people and called me. He said, "Don't bring the pimp hand, "bring the Gangsta Brown hand." And I was there front and center to take care of some things for him that needed to be handled that he felt like I can handle the job. Now, that's how I know that he's a soldier, you feel me? When you call me, yeah, you want it done! - For you niggas to come though this motherfucker and set here and say the shit that you've been saying, and I'm a call one nigga out in particular, and nigga you know who I'm talking about. You know who I'm talking about nigga. All of a sudden now nigga, you on his side? Fuck that, you challenge his pimping, nigga! Nigga, you ain't never been in the position to say about where this nigga is at! You know, you ain't never been on this nigga's level. You know who I'm talking about, I'm talking about you, Gangsta Brown! And this TL saying this motherfucking shit, nigga! And you know what the fuck I'm talking about. You challenge his pimping, nigga! And I don't respect the bullshit, nigga. I'm keeping it real, if you got a problem with me nigga, holler! 'Cause it's real and I don't want this shit x'd out, I don't want none of this shit, put this shit on here. Because you challenged him, nigga. You challenged him with that bullshit. Now, you come through this motherfucker tonight nigga hollering about you on his side, you don't like them niggas? You was one of the same niggas that was coming with that bullshit! But what this nigga is doing now, this nigga been doing this shit every since I met this nigga in the 80s. When I first met this nigga, this nigga first motherfucking Rolls that I know of was the motherfucking Silver Shadow, nigga. He went from there nigga to the Zimmer, to all the other bullshit. This nigga done ran through more shit than the average nigga have ever seen and for a nigga to come through here, and think it's all good, and think it's gravy and think I'm just gone sit back and just let that shit just go like that? Nah, nigga, it's not happening like that with me. This is TL, nigga, I'm that gangster nigga. - And we have a good rapport. I see him all the time, not only in Fresno, but in New Orleans, Las Vegas, in LA, and we all still have a good rapport because we were fair to each other. - A nigga father supposed to be his hero. I don't know if y'all nigga's fathers was y'all hero. I don't know if y'all came up up under that. My father was my motherfucking hero. When I came up, I should be a pro ball motherfucking player. My father wasn't no motherfucking ball player. My father was about this motherfucking game. - Well, I think he's a cool cat, he doing what he do. Keep doing your thang, man. - It's a pleasure to be here, to give him this kind of respect on this day, because he deserves all of it. - Yeah, shout out to Virg. Yeah, yeah I know one of the true, true legends of the game. Yeah, old Virgil. Yeah, looking forward to seeing to you on the red carpet. - Virgil, I'm looking forward to seeing you on the red carpet. See ya' soon. - Pleasure meeting my man. Anybody that they will stop Monday night football to announce that he got arrested, anybody they do that for, count me in, Jack! When they do the movie, I'm there, brother. We look just the same, if I had the jewelry on that you did, boy we'd be twins! (laughter) You feel me? - Only a chosen few can win. I'm just blessed to be one of the ones that was able to reach out and keep this going. For the last 50 years, because there's nothing easy about it. A lot of fellas don't never even get a chance to live out they dreams or they visions. And I thank God everyday for being blessed to live out my whole entire existence. - And all the young people you need to stop hating, and could do some congratulating. Don't be a hater, be a congratulator. 'Cause Virgil is a bad motherfucker, okay? He's a businessman. In real estate, you know. I'm looking for him to buy a airplane next year. The Rolls ain't nothing. (laughter) You know, he headed that way. * You ain't the working kind of nigga. * You needs to keep it pimping. - [Voiceover] When white folks found out Black men were becoming pimps and pimping was an immediate means of acquiring power, the type of power Black Americans had never experienced, they introduced the Mann Act in 1910, prohibited so called, "White-slavery," making pandering, AKA pimping illegal. * And watch her bring it back * That's how my dollars stack * Keeping her on the track * And let her holler back * You see it take a special kind of mind * To have a bitch's head and keep her ass on the grind * Ass on the line just to see her daddy smile today * Jewelry blinging you can see me from a mile away * Get a quarter before it's over, she better find a way * Or she'll be sleeping on the corner * - [Voiceover] Virgil escaped the street life with his health and mind in tact, which 90% of hustlers never do. * 'Cause I'm laced with so much game * So no matter what I do * I keep it pimping * I got style, I got class * I keep my boot in a bitch's ass * So no matter what I do I keep it pimping * Take a look in the mirror * Who do you see * Try to focus on your past * And where you try to be * (mumbles) pave the way so I can get paid * Get rich or die trying (mumbles) * Everything sure to come call me the chosen one * Never had a dad, momma laced her son * My life's like a title from a (mumbles) book * A whore's son, here I come given in the same * - [Voiceover] The story was so big before Virgil went to trial, he was approached by movie producers and book authors, wanting to produce a movie and book about his life. He declined, because he didn't want to incriminate himself. * That real hustle and flow diversified * You see I'm on the rise to build my enterprise * Game recognizes game, I'm certified * I want riches I want fame * 'Cause I'm laced with so much game * So no matter what I do * I keep it pimping * I got style, I got class * I keep my boot in a bitch's ass * So no matter what I do * I keep it pimping, 24/7, 365 * 24/7, 365 * 365 * 24/7 - [Voiceover] He moved on and became an author. He wrote books, he did interviews, personal appearances, appears in music videos, invests in real estate and retired a lucky man. - And I'm tired of fruiting the laborer, can I reap some of the benefits?
