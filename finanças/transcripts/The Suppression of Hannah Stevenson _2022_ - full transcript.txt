Can you confirm the identity of these two people for me please? Yeah. That's Traian and... ...Elinska. Eliska! Yeah, that was it. What about this girl? Do you know who she is? Of course I do. She's my girlfriend At least... ...she was. Really? That's the last one, I promise. Hold on... ...imagine there's a little gorilla on your left shoulder. What!? Trust me, just look at your left shoulder, imagine it's there. You know I hate having my photo taken. Can you blame me? You try going out with the most gorgeous girl in the whole wide world. You're hopeless! I know. How about you take a photo of something else for a change, and I'll grab us something for dinner? Fine. I'll be back. Hey! Leave. Now! You ok? Yeah. I'm Traian. Hannah. Hannah? Yes. Pretty name for a pretty girl. Are you American? British actually. Ah, of course! How do you like my country? It's lovely, very peaceful. I could give you a little tour if you like? I know all the best places, what to see, where to eat. No, it's ok actually, my boyfriend's waiting outside for me. Boyfriend? What's his name? Look, I'd better be off, thanks again for your help. No problem. Perhaps we will... ...see each other again? Yeah, maybe. Is everything alright? Yeah, fine... honestly Nothing took your fancy then? No. Let's eat out, shall we? Yeah, I'm game if you are? OK Shut your eyes. Do it, do it! Ta-da! Open it then. It's beautiful. I though you might like it, it should match the earrings your brother got you. It's perfect, thank you. Here's to us. It's good that! Sorry about earlier. Sorry I was in such a rush to get away from the supermarket. It was all a bit overwhelming. That's ok Everyone's first time abroad can be a bit daunting. Oh, it's not that, my Ex and I went to Gran Canaria last Summer. Oh, ok. It was more a case of too much choice and not enough vocabulary. We've all been there. I remember Ian and I, we almost got arrested because we couldn't read the signs at the beach. What happened? Well, we were both... You were both? You know what... he was an asshole, let's not talk about it. You can't just leave it there. Look, can we just leave it and enjoy our evening? Yeah, of course. Ah, perfect timing! Thank you. They sound quite good. Yeah. Do you think we should join them? Why not, huh? I can't believe that just happened? I didn't know you could dance like that. Neither did I! Hey, Traian. Who spat in your soup? Not tonight Tanya. I know this look... ...only one thing on your mind. I said "not tonight". That's better. That was crazy, I've never done anything like that before. Never? You looked like you were enjoying it though? Absolutely! Umm... I tell you what... ...why don't you head back to the cottage and I'll meet you there in a few minutes? Well... I can if you want? Trust me, it'll be worth it. Alright. Go on! Hello. You like this one? Yeah. Ok, let me show you. You want brief or thong? What do you think? This is sexier, no? Yeah, very much so. Lucky girl! Hannah? Just a sec... What's in the bag? Just... ...a little 'something' to spice things up. I'll wait here. Take off your dress. What's wrong? Are you sure this is really me? Yeah, of course. You don't like it? I'm grateful that you bought it for me. I don't know what you want? I don't want anything. I mean it. Look, if you want me to wear it... No, it's fine. Where are you going? For a walk. Shall I come with? No, I just need some air, OK? Well, be careful. Yeah. Matt wait! I'd hoped I would get a chance to see you again. Oh... hi. I must admit I barely got a chance to look at you in the supermarket. Pay no attention to those small-minded townsfolk, they're always afraid of what they don't understand. Not you... ...you're curious. So, I'm guessing you're not a local then? I'm more of a local that you are, no? True. My name is Eliska. I'm Hannah. Please... take a seat Hannah Thank you. Something to drink? No, thank you. Mind if I? Oh yeah, go ahead. Where's that handsome man I saw you with? I'm sorry? I saw the two of you earlier leaving the bar together. Oh, I see. Well... To tell you the truth, I don't know where he is... we had a fight. That's a shame, you make such a picturesque couple. It's my fault. I keep getting hung up on stupid little things. Hung up? I... have difficulty... ...satisfying him in the bedroom. Ah! Has he voiced concern? No, but... ...I can tell it's an issue. You're an attractive girl? It's not that. It's more like... ...it's more like he wants this... That's fantasy! Surely I should go some way to making it a reality? I am his girlfriend. So, what's the problem!? It's not that I don't want to do certain things... ...I've had a bad experience in the past and it's taking me a while to feel confident again. If that's the case, then you should be honest with him. I've tried but... ...you know... ...he'll think I'm being a prude. There is something I can give to help with your situation, but I wouldn't recommend it. Why not? The results can be... unpredictable. Please, I just want him back. This will rid you of what you consider to be your inhibitions, but you should only use it if you are sure that is what you want. Where were you? I was looking for you. You knew I'd come back here. I wasn't sure, and besides, I wanted to apologise. What for? For being a wimp. It's alright, I understand, these things, they take time. But I don't want to disappoint you. I just want you to feel wanted, desired, you know? I do. Could you wait here a moment? I'll be back. What do you think? You alright? You OK? Give me a sec. Excuse me, do you speak English? Have you seen this girl? Excuse me... You OK friend? You speak English? Yes. Have you heard anything about an English woman at all? Oh, you mean the dancing girl, yes, she was here last night. I mean my 'girlfriend', have you seen her? Yes, I've seen her. Where? At the supermarket yesterday morning. What's wrong? Come with me. Alright witch, start talking. Have you finally gone mad Traian? The girl that was with my friend here, what have you done to her? That is between he and I, not you. You try my patience. Then leave. Be careful. I would think long and hard before letting him call you 'a friend'. Look, I'm not looking for any trouble, I'm just looking for my girlfriend, OK? Some of the townsfolk told me that she came here last night. She did. Please take a seat. Wait... ...so Hannah consumed this stuff without having any idea what it could do to her? She knew she would no longer be worried about whether she pleases you. Is that what she told you? I just wanted her to open up for her own sake. How noble of you! Look, just tell me where she is. I can't. I don't know. If you find her, give his this. It'll counteract whatever effect the potion has taken. You better hope I find her. I sincerely hope you do. Any luck? Maybe. Well, what did she say? She said she'd given Hannah this medicine. Medicine!? What kind of medicine? I don't know. Why? Pay no attention to me. If I were you, I would look in the next village along, beyond the woodland. She may have gone off exploring on her own for a bit. Maybe. It's more that I deserve. I'll keep my ear to the ground here, just in case she returns. And, if in the meantime you do find her, you can always call me. If you stick to the main road going out of town, going East... ...you should get there eventually. Alright. Thanks Traian. No problem my friend. It's OK... It's OK... Careful! Did you cut yourself? You must be hungry? I'll be back. No. No! I'm sorry, it's just... it's been so long. Wait! Hannah... ...it's me. It's Matt. Listen... You're sick, you're not well. I need to give you this medicine. It'll make you better, OK? Just take this and we can go back to how it was. Hannah! What the hell are you doing? Protecting her from men like you. I'm her boyfriend! What? Her partner, her man. And you treat her like that!? Shit. A demon? I don't know, it's just... ...that's what she looked like. Alright... Wait for me to call you tomorrow. Sit tight, OK? Yes? OK. Meet me at the witch's shop in ten minutes. Ladies. I'm sick of just sitting around. We'll never find her in darkness, she's in her element. How could she be so stupid... ...trusting that gypsy woman? You mean Eliska? The woman in the little shop. She tricked Hannah into taking this drug and... ...whatever it was, it turned her into that thing. I think she's beautiful. Do you? You've got a strange idea of beauty. Do you think she remembers who I am? Does the butterfly remember being... ...a catapillar? I don't know. We'll find out. I thought I made it clear, you're no longer welcome here. The Englishman said you cursed his woman, I want to know why. Becasue she needs her eyes opened to the fate that awaits her... ...if she continues to submit to people like you. Is that the same lie you told yourself when Melina came to you? Go to hell Traian. You first. Where are you going? To find that gypsy woman. Will you take coffee before you go? No, I'm OK. If I find the potion, I'll give you a call. With any luck, we can find Hannah and make her better again. You think that is what is best for her? Are you serious? She's sick and she's vulnerable. To whom? She made light work of you. To herself! Please... ...just stay here. When I get back, we can look for her together. Thank you. The Englishman? You want us to go after him? No. There's no point... ...not until we have the girl. You, stay here... ...we'll call you if we find anything. Beware of the girl, Viktor. Hey. Hey. Nice to see a familiar face. Good morning. What are you doing here? Eliska wanted something from the shop. Oh. It's not what you think! Are you... After you. Thank you. Eliska? Where is she? I don't know. She knew I would be stopping by. What's the deal with you and this Eliska woman anyway? Hmm? How come you're the only one not prepared to give her the cold shoulder? The big guy... err... Traian... ...he can't stand her. He says she's some kind of witch. A witch!? To be perfectly honest, I'm inclined to agree with him. I know this is going to sound crazy, but... ...I think she drugged Hannah. Hannah? My girlfriend. Here... Pretty. And... ...is this the girl that you bought the lingerie for? Yeah. Did she like it? Eventually. Not at first. So... ...you convinced her? Not quite. That Eliska woman, she gave her this drug... Hannah must have taken it in the bathroom? Shit. Why wouldn't she talk to me? Why wouldn't she consult me before taking that? Some women need their armour... ...and some feel trapped by it. I have to find her. I'll head out to the woods, I'll go back to the cabin and find Codrin. You met Codrin? Yeah, why? You do know that him and Traian are brothers? You could have fooled me. They used to be much closer, but... ...that was before Melina came along. So, they fell out? Over her? Codrin worshipped the very ground she walked on, while Traian saw her as the ultimate trophy. It didn't matter though. She ran off with somebody else? She killed herself. Why? Traian believes that she was poisoned by Eliska. And was she? Who can really say? Look... ...if you got involved with Codrin, Traian will know about it and... ...he's a dangerous man. Seriously? Please, just trust me. You should call the police. I can't risk it. If anyone see's Hannah like I saw her, they'll have her committed. Unless, of course, the authorities really do believe that Eliska is a witch? How could anyone prove such a thing? Exactly! OK, well... ...good luck finding her. Thanks. Just be careful. You know, I never understood this little self-imposed exile you went into after Melina's death, but I must say... ...it seems to have provided the perfect opportunity for her atonement. Traian... No, no, no. Get some rest, brother. Killing me won't bring Melina back, Traian. I'm well aware of that, witch. I just want you to watch, while I take what is owed me. Don't you touch her! Shut her up. Watch. There's no sport if they don't fight back. Hello? Codrin, it's Matt. Matt, my old friend, I wondered where you had got too. Traian. Yes. I'm afraid Codrin is... ...incapacitated. Listen, Matt... I think I may have something that belongs to you. Let me talk to her. Of course. Sweetie... ...are you there? I'm coming straight to you... Traian, if you harm her I'll... You'll what? I'll be waiting. Well... ...while we wait for the last piece of our puzzle to arrive... ...let's have a little fun, ay boys? You western girls, you do insist on putting yourselves on show. OK everybody, let's just relax, shall we? Let her go, Traian. I can't do that, my friend. It's not an option, neither is letting you leave here alive. This is no time for heroics, brother. The blood in our veins only runs so thick. It's going to be OK Sweetie. Oh this? Are you talking to this!? This is NOT your girlfriend. You girlfriend died when she made a deal with this Devil's Harlot! Now can everyone shut the fuck up and watch me take my fill!? Don't fucking touch her you bastard! Enough of this! It's no good Traian... ...your fill has been had. What do you mean? When you found us by the river... ...you were too late. No. No, you're lying. When have I ever lied to you... ...brother? Look at what you have done. Look at what YOU have done! Wait! Traian's right... ...this is my fault. This isn't you. You're Hannah Stevenson. You're kind, the sweetest girl I've ever met. I'm so sorry for what I've done to you, but let me make it right. So please... ...I'm asking you... ...let him go. Please, just let us go. You coward! Police! Put the gun down, put your hands behind your head. I said "put down the gun". We've got one dead male, one male two females, unarmed. Get him to the station. Listen, the girl, she's... Quiet! You don't understand, she's ill, OK? She needs medicine. Please. Do you understand me? Can you understand what I'm saying? She's ill, she's not safe, OK? Listen to me! She's not well, she needs medicine. That's quite a story! It's true... ...every word. I didn't think you'd believe me. Can you just tell me what happened to Hannah? Your girlfriend is fine, Mr Peters. She was discharged from the surgery, and is receiving medical treatment back at your holiday cottage. Just do one more thing for me please. Describe for me again Hannah's physical appearance after having drunk the potion. It was horrible. She was really thin, and pale, and you could see her veins through her skin as clear as day. But the worst part was her eyes, just really hollow and sore. You mean like this? Jesus! Thank you Mr Peters, you're free to go. Mr Peters? Yeah, how is she? Your wife is asleep upstairs. She's not my wife actually. She's very weak, and will need to continue taking steriods for another two days, OK. but she will be fine once you return home. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hey Sweetie, how are you feeling? Sore. Do you remember much? Just... ...sounds... ...images. It was like a dream. When we were in the cabin, Codrin he... ...he said you and him... That we...? It can wait. OK. Yeah, she's still pretty fatigued, but she's getting better. Oh, that's really good. And you say that you're flying home early? Yeah, today actually. I was wondering if... ...you fancied coming to the shop? You know, just to say goodbye? I normally would, but... ...with Hannah and everything it's just... Oh no no no, that's OK. That is very thoughtful of you though. But, thank you. Thank you so much for your help. You're welcome, and... once again, sorry for going against your wishes and informing the police. Probably the best decision anyone's made! Thanks.
