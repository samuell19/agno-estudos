Presented by TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System, Inc.) TOHO CO., LTD. Patient here! Over here. Severe burn injury, Doctor. OK, on three. 1, 2, 3! Can you hear me? Male in his 30s, upper body burns. Possible air passage, too. Consciousness level 2. Give me an 18-gauge PVC. Patient! Taking blood pressure! Tell me what you get. It's a store fire! Burn casualties are high! More? Smoke inhalation victim! Over there. Fire's at a department store! Full body burn victim! Put him here for now. Tojo ER. Female, 20s, fulI body burns? Yes, bring her. Doctors! D.O.A. Sorry, we're overbooked! Wait in the hall. What? Tojo ER. Female, 50s, chest injury, oral bleeding? Yes, we'll take her. No, we won't! We will. Just say "No"! Tojo ER. Male, 30s, upper burns. Yes, bring him in. We'll take them. We'll take them all. The Triumphant General Rouge Dr. Numata! We've debated this issue 3 times already! Let it go! There's nothing here about patient side effects or adverse events. That's your mistake. What patient? This was research on autopsy imaging analysis. The "patient" was dead! As hospital GM, I'm saying... you can't put a corpse in an MRI machine. You were in the U. S., Mr. Mifune. Post-mortem MRI is common practice! Japanese patients are more sensitive. Most would find it very creepy to enter a machine a corpse had passed through. Don't you agree? From an admnistrative standpoint, we can't condone it. The hospital bears MRI fees. Tojo University School of Medecine Ethics Committee Quiet, please. I object! We solved the Batista murders this way! Right, Chairperson? Are you even Iistening to all this, Chairperson Taguchi? Chairperson Taguchi, do you have an opinion? We... I... don't think it's my place. Don't be silly. After our director personally recommended you for this post? I absolutely insist. Yes, but... I really have no idea. Who needs you?! That's how he talks to his mother, now that he's in colIege. That's awful. How's the numbness in your hand? Oh, it comes and goes. Then yesterday, he... I can't eat bananas anymore. Bananas? Yeah, ever since my blood transfusion. My girlfriend's really worried because I used to love bananas. She thinks I may die. I'm terrified that the scar from my operation wilI reopen. I can see how you'd be worried. I'm afraid to stick out my chest when walk. Or bloat my stomach with a beer. Or squeeze hard on the toilet. I can't raise my voice at work. Why don't you give it a try and puff out your chest? Don't worry. This is a hospital. Okay. But don't blame me. Take care. Thanks! See ya! Long day? People send me their patients for every little thing now. It's alot of extra work. Ever since Batista, your stock has risen. Don't say that. You've got mail... Chairperson. Stop it. "Ethics Committee Chairperson" "ER Chief Physician, Dr. Hayami..." "has collusive relations with medical supply company, Medical Arts." "Look into cardiac catheter purchases." "ER Head Nurse Hanabusa is a co-conspirator." Are you familiar with Dr. Hayami? A little bit. From my intern days. People call him "General." He tends to make decisions unilaterally. That's earned him many enemies. And some resent him becoming Chief Physician so young. But we can't ignore this accusation. Will you look into it? Who? Chairperson. I...don't think I'm right for... We're finally recovering from the Batista scandal. Another one could destroy us. Make sure this remains strictIy internal. Well... then... if all goes well, can I quit as Chairperson? Two outs! Medical Arts. "...a collusive relationship..."' Play ball! Dr. Taguchi! Quick pose! Beautiful! Yamamoto, you stink! Oh, you mean "General Rouge." "Rouge"? I've never heard that before. I have. It's the nickname ER staff gave Chief Hayami. General Rouge. What would "Rouge" stand for? Lipstick? Cross-dresser? Heard it comes from his getting soaked in blood during an operation. He continued operating with a blood stained face. So it means the "Bloody General." Look. That's the "General 's" car. Rouge. Expensive wheels. I heard he loves money. Emergency Medical Care Center This is going to prick a littIe. Over here! Easy now. Can you hear me? Male, 34. He's vomited a lot of blood. Monitor! Turn sideways. Saturation. Running ECG. Vital signs? 80 over 40, puIse 130... respiration GCS 200. Nurse Kisaragi. JCS, not GCS. Sorry. Be accurate. Give me 2 lines. In place. Take over. Yes. Condition? I see. What? Female in an auto collision. Multiple trauma, collapsed skulI. Say no. Yes. Take her. I thought he went home. Bring her. No! All ICUs are full! No beds! Move Mr. Akatsu in Bed 3 to the surgical ward. Impossible! He's still in a coma from abdominal aortic surgery! Half their nursing staff is in pre-op for organ surgery. They can care for him. Dean Kurosaki will have a fit. The old man's in Vienna taking in an opera. We're moving a patient to your ward. So... what brings an administrative head to this remote sector? Your air ambulance request. The "reactivation of which you've determined is not possible"... "though it pains you to say so" Precisely. Wish I had a penny for every time I've heard that. This hospital is operating in the red. Helicopters that cost 2 trillion yen in annual upkeep alone... are the last thing we need. What's that heliport for, then? Besides being a secret smoking area. Smoking area? Smoking is strictl y forbidden on hospital grounds. This won't do. What does this mean? I don't know. Explain this to me! Problem? Alcohol poisoning patient. How can you charge this much for one night? For one IV drip? That's ridicuIous! Ah, but it says 2 days. What? I was here one! The new day begins at midnight. You were brought in at 11:55 p. m. But that's 5 minutes! Learn to moderate your liquor and stop calling ambulances. There you go. Ready with CV. Good. Damn it! Now? Nothing. No use. CPA. Take him back to Bed 3. 1 mg. epinephrine. Then 20cc of saline. I said CPA. Let me. Epinephrine. I'll take over. Go prep the OR. Yes, ma'am. What do you want? How've you been? Fine, thank you. I thought you were scared of blood. What do you want? Epinephrine's in. CV! Well... um... If I continue this for an hour, how much do you think it costs? 30 bucks. And listening to patient complaints? 20 dollars? 30? About that. Doesn' t seem fair. ER Chief Physician, Dr. Hayami... has collusive ties with the Medical Arts company. ER Head Nurse Hanabusa is a co-conspirator. We go in. Retractor. 30 units of blood. Type 0 if we're short. Satinsky clamp. Line. She's back. So what do we do next? Emergency CT, then to OR. Buzz. 60 points. No time for CT. You go directIy to OR. You must be happy. We saved a paying customer. Hello, Doctor! Return 3 as a commission? I'll just take one. Hello, ladies! Mr. Isobe! Did you enjoy the sweets? Dr. Numata! I'm really not cut out for this kind of work. Dr. Taguchi. There is... ahem... something I'd like you to have. Oh no, no. That would be wrong. No, it's not... I can't... really! But it's only... Absolutely not! No way! I put the softball photos on a CD. "For Dr. Taguchi" I've been handling them out. Shinya Isobe. Medical Arts. Suicide? What? A salesman jumped from the heliport. He's dead. Yes! Police are here to see Dr. Taguchi. Know a Mr. Isobe? Yes. You two argued before his death. Huh? Hear about Dr. Taguchi? Killing Mr. Isobe? Over a softball game. Or a crime of passion. Got to be a mix-up. Could've been liquor. It changes her. She had too much to handle. She was exhausted. Still... she's no killer. I almost confessed doing it. I'm so relieved you're innocent. He was considerate to everybody. Must've had pent-up stress. Only God can spot signs of suicide. You alright? Yeah... I just got a chill. Caught a cold in jail, huh? I wasn't in jail. Did you hear about Mr. Isobe? Apparent suicide. I spoke with him right before it happened. Hey... yesterday's footage! Didn't see it. Didn't tape it, either. Some psychotherapist. You couldn't spot a suicide. You just listen to complaints. So what do you want? I received a letter accusing you of shady dealings with Medical Arts. Who leaked that? Doctor, you don't mean... I'm kidding. But why send that to you? I really don't know. So as Ethics chair, do you believe it? Oh, no. Yet you interrogate? I'm not interrogating. It's just that... What's wrong? Nothing. I just thought Mr. Isobe... You sure you're alright? What's come over me? Strange. This is supposed to be an A-rated ER. But it deserves a B or C. Far too few doctors. You're interns, aren' t you? What school? I'm Tokyo U. Mr. Shiratori! Do something! What happened? Traffic accident. This hurt? Just a simple fracture. "Just" ? What do you mean "just" ? A bone fracture effects the entire body. Teenage girl, overdose, duration unclear! Administer a tranquilizer. Vitals? Leve 300. Others stable. I recognize her. Yeah, she's a regular. Saturation. Gastric lavage. Hey, don't ignore me. That's wrong. Wrap from the periphery not from above. I'm not a guinea pig. My card's in my coat pooket. I know. You cracked the Batista case. Mr. Shiratori something. I'm Shiratori from the Ministry of Health and Labor. You the chief? Our ratings determine your subsidies. Quiet! We don't treat minor injuries here. But you know that, right? Do something. Gulliver! GuIliver! Gulliver's not this small. The Gulliver-Lilliputian size ratio is about 100 to 7. I 'm sorry "little" Keisuke, but pediatrics had the only vacancies. No, this is perfect for catching the killer off guard. "Killer"? This is a surprise. What happened? Get this. I was the victim of a hit-and-run motorcyclist. How awful. But it's no average hit-and-run. It's a murder plot. Keisuke Shiratori. Ministry of Health and Labor. "ER Chief Physician, Dr. Hayami..." "has collusive relations with medical supply company, Medical Arts." "Look into cardiac catheter purchases." Someone here is quietly plotting my assassination. Actually, a nearby identical letter was sent to Dr. Taguchi. Really? But her letter was hand-written. And also named Head Nurse Hanabusa as a co-conspirator. Yours was typed. Mine had more info. Don't look so smug. Anyway, someone's trying to kilI me. I think you're over-reacting. I see these two letters as an attempt to defame Dr. Hayami. Well, my ministry cannot ignore this. And Dr. Taguchi lacks the sleuthing skilIs to find the truth. So, I've got to save you again. Growing farsighted already? No, it's the gradual loss of lens elasticity... distorting the ability to focus on items at arm's length. Normal in one's early 40s. Farsighted. This is business letterhead. I see that. What stands out about this letter? It's dry tone? I'm disappointed. Let me explain to save time. This letter names Nurse Hanabusa as a co-conspirator. I know. Depending upon which one of our Ietters is the original... the writer either added, or deleted, the line about Nurse Hanabusa. It would seem so. That means two different interests are at play here. Okay. Or the same person wrote both. Hmm, so what do you suggest? Who resents Dr. Hayami? Well, there is someone. And he's due to drop by. You OK, Mr. Shiratori? So you're the one who resents Dr. Hayami! Hey! That's right. What do you think is ER's biggest problem? Bad treatment of patients? We treat life or death patients. Your problem can be treated at a neighborhood clinic. But once we accept a patient, we must treat them. And Dr. Hayami accepts them alI. He's got us working 24-7. He's killing us. More patients, more money. No wonder you're thriving. "Thriving"? That's a joke. Know what your hospital fee pays for? The pediatrics ward. Really? Take these gauze bandages. Unlike medicine, they're not covered in the cost of treatment. So burn patients cost alot. ER's not making a cent! With money, we could hire more doct... And you call yourselves "A-rated"? We have enough doctors. No problem there. Bye-bye, Gulliver! It's not a single but don't complain. Anything away from "toddler land." ER has such a wonderful staff. Thanks to Chief Hayami? Yes, the General, I mean... Dr. Hayami, is our leader. And he and the head nurse are like peas in a pod. Nurse Numata? Is that how it looks? It's not? She supports him very strongly. But she can't support him alone. Can you fill this in for me? My hand's numb. Sure. 4-syllabic word for "Okinawa." Starts with "A" "Ankimo"? "America"? It's "Awamori" . May I? Back off! Handwriting's not a match. Strange. Any others who resent Dr. Hayami or Nurse Hanabusa? I'vee no choice but to use the informant. "Informant"? Is there such person? Informant? The "anti-Hayami" group is... Dr. Komatsu of Internal Medicine, brain surgeons Takano and Matsuoka. Nurse Hayashi and Dr. Gondo in Pediatrics. That many? Dr. Hayami has enemies all over this hospital. Same goes for Nurse Hanabusa. She's alI business. Been that way from the start. But why are they so hated? There are 8 ICU beds. That's not enough when Dr. Hayami takes all comers. So patients get sent to other wards. Other wards hate it. Exactly. I hear Surgical Ward 1 keeps recovered patients longer... so they can fill beds and refuse Dr. Hayami. Very political. Surgical Ward 1? You know. Dean Kurosaki. He's been in Vienna since last week. Who's closest to Dean Kurosaki? That would be neuropsychiatrist, Dr. Numata. Quiet please. They're both Ethics Committee vice-chairmen. The chairperson's right here. Unbelievable. I agree. But I'll be quitt ing soon. I second that. Thank you. How may I help you? We're re-evaluating the ER ward... Do that later. Yes. Your committee is debating the future of ER. Chairperson Taguchi seems clueless, so I've come to you, "Vice"-Chairman. If a "Vice"-Chairman will do. Sorry. I've heard much about you. That you're highly respected here. You're the "real" power behind the Ethics Committee. You being sarcastic? No. Unlike that odious ER Chief, Dr. Hayami... you're the most respected man in this hospital. That's an overstatement. But I won't deny it. I despise Hayami. And I'm sure Dean Kurosaki joins me in that sentiment. Hayami has many enemies. It must've been humiliating for Dean Kurosaki... to see his junior, Takashina, named hospital director. And see Hayami so favored by the Director. What's your point? You hate Dr. Hayami. While the "General" basks in glory... you smolder in a dark hole. Then Taguchi is appointed Ethics Chair over you... making you and Kurosaki into a hospital laughing stock. You conspired with Kurosaki to destroy Hayami... by sending out letters accusing him of corruption! "Letters"? What letters? Interesting. So you think I wrote these? Didn't you? I'm afraid not. But if the accusations are true... we have a big problem. We'll take it up in committee. Under Item 7 of committee code, we will hold a special session. Komine, set the date. Summon Director Takashina, too. OK with you, Chairperson Taguchi? I'd like to be an observer. OK with you, Chairperson Taguchi? By the way, Mr. Isobe of Medical Arts visited you often. All suppliers do. Why'd you show him the letters? Now it's public! Why's he here? Follow that man! Who? Been a while, Mifune. Shouldn't you be resting? So you knew I was here and you didn't pay me a visit? Acquaintances? Formerly my junior at the ministry. Got a U.S. Master's degree on ministry money, and then quit. We call him "eat-and-run Mifune." Why's he here? He's GM in charge of improving hospital management. GM? I see. If anyone can save this hospital from failure, you can. I'm doing my best. Don't you find Dr. Taguchi highIy expendabIe? No, she plays a very important role here. Although she could prescribe more medecine. That won't work. I'll bet Dr. Numata is efficient at that. And at reducing patient visit times. Yes, you're correct. Not planning a major overhaul, are you Mifune? Drastic reform creates friction. It must be done prudently. What is it? Good luck. I'm rooting for you. He and Numata are working together. Can two bad personalities Iike that get along? You're so naive. Unlike you, Numata can't idly listen to patients all day. "Idly"? He's the type who seeks profit from high patient turnover. Forget bedside manner. Drugs make patients happy. He keeps them coming back for more. He doesn't need any more investment except rooms and chairs. That's why they get along. Hello. What do you want? Just wondering about you. I saw them bring you in. Should I leave? Rehabilitation Ward That kills! Come again. No one's ever just sat with me without talking. I'm not much of a doctor. I probably can't give you any medical help. But if you want to talk, come see me They call my office the "Complaint Department." May I? Sure. Are you...? investigating something? What? Why do you ask? I heard rumors. He's like a child, you know. The "General"? Yes. The spoiIed general. What does "Rouge" in "General Rouge" stand for? I'd never heard it. Remember the Joto Department Store fire 10 years ago? Yes, but I was still a student then. Over 100 people of varying injuries were brought here. It was after 7 p.m. Most of the doctors had gone home. We were between nurse shifts, too. It was the most understaffed time of the day. Among them was a much younger Dr. Hayami. The Director was overseas. Dr. Hayami made a hospital-wide announcement. "I repeat. We are receiving dozens of fire victims!" "I'm declaring emergency status!" "Staff in all wards are to report to me." ICU beds were quickly filled. But Dr. Hayami continued to accept all medic requests. ER was overflowing with patients. They filled the hallways. But eventually, he had to start turning people away. Ah... I see. Hence the "Bloody General." "Bloody"? "Rouge" stands for "bloody." No. It doesn't? Since that day, it's like he's been possessed. He couldn't bear to refuse patients. There was no air ambulance. If there had been, he could've saved more lives. What does it mean? It's a bizarre development. So there's more than one accuser? No. The letters are too similar. Very puzzling. We want you to attend an Ethics Committee meeting. The Health Ministry received a Ietter, too, huh? Yes. But it was typed. His letter didn't mention Nurse Hanabusa. I use Medical Arts' catheters because they're superior. So the accusation is groundless? Hmm, I wonder. What 's in here? What do you think? Spoils from Medical Arts? Precisely. Would you like to see? No. Don't you feel responsible for Mr. Isobe's death? He couldn't satisfy your demands, so he took his life. What other reason is there? He even chose your sacred spot, the heliport. If you have evidence of collusion, show it to me. Thanks for your time. Wait a second. Not you. Excuse me. I must thank you. That suicidal girl patient came to see me. She did? She said she's glad she met you. She may be brought in on an overdose again. Yes. But she might also stop doing it forever. A lot of the patients brought to us are attempted suicides. All I can do is keep them alive. Pump the stomach, stop the bleeding. Use precious blood only to see them die later. You see, a lot leave the hospital only to return again. Those patients need early mental care. Yes. I'd like you to handle that, Dr. Taguchi. But... we'd need to ask... Numata? Forget it. I want to ask you. Understood. If you think I can help. By the way. Tomorrow's meeting should be exciting. The accuser could've been Mr. Isobe. If he found it increasingly difficult to meet Hayami's demands. But this letter can't be his. Oh, you finally bought glasses. Can you see well now? Too well... even the stain of the ink. A ballpoint pen was used, and I spotted ink puddles. Once after Hanabusa's name. And once after "Head Nurse". That means there was hesitation. What does that tell us? Don't know yet? There are two possibilities. Hesitation about which title to use? Or whether to use a titIe aften her own name at all. Ms. Fujiwara. You've known all along who wrote this. It's been too long, Ms. Fujiwara. You've become a fine nurse. No, not yet. Why did you do it? I guess I can't fool you. I found this in the trash in ER. Probably thrown out as a misprint. I just happened to spot it near the top of the plastic bag. So it had to be written by somebody on ER staff, Infusion? Hurry. No, we go with double. Infusion here, too! So you rewrote it and sent it to Dr. Taguchi. And added your name. Which means...! the accusations are true? Let us begin this special meeting of the Tojo Ethics Committee. We have Director Takashina and attorney Nomura with us as observers. I came straight from Narita, but the traffic was miserable. Forgive my tardiness. Sorry I'm late. I was doing a tracheotomy. Let's see... is the defendant's chair for me? Please look at the paper in your hand. It contains an accusation sent to me a week ago... describing kickbacks received by Dr. Hayami. The accuser... The accuser is not important at this time. What's important is determining the veracity of the cIaim. Dr. Hayami. You profess innocence... Hold on, Dr. Numata. I never said I was innocent. The accusation in the letter... is true. Dr. Hayami, wouId you explain? Haven't any of you wondered how ER gets by? 5 yeans ago when I became Chief, I was told... "Don't worry about what things cost." "But make a place that turns away no one." '"The air ambulance is not off limits." Isn't that right, Director? Yes. So I readily accepted. We were to employ a system involving cooperation of various physicians. But what I saw in reality was... not enough beds, and no cooperation! Dr. Igarashi. Last month you refused to help why? "Too many outpatients." Yet you were in the cafeteria. Is that where you see patients? No, circumstances... I reported that to the Risk Management Committee. But it was soon stricken from the record. By Dr. Murakami? It wasn't! I mean... Dean Kurosaki. What?! Rumor has it you keep your ward at full occupancy... so that you can refuse patients. I don't allocate beds. The nurse station does. GM Mifune. What is it? When you arrived... you told me you planned to cut money-losing divisions. Not "cut." "We must not fail", you said. You miIked patients with minor injuries... slashed labor costs, cut personnel! Those remaining haven't been home in a month. Finances are dire. But so are people in need of treatment! So you're saying... the money you got in kickbacks was used for ER treatment? Mainly equipment and perishables. Even so, we remained in the red. Be that as it may... you've admitted to collusive ties with a supplier. As Vice-Chairman, I must address your accountability. Dr. Numata is right. It is a serious breach of commercial law. Dr. Hayami, you have abused your authority for some time. 10 years ago, you openly broke rules during the Joto fire. Even though some called you the "General" for it... you usurped Dean Kurosaki's authority. Your hot-blooded reckless actions ultimately caused a major fiasco. Dr. Numata You just said what I've been wanting to let out for years. But this time. Dr. Hayami's transgressions are criminal. And even wanrant litigation. We defer to you, attorney. If it can be established it was done for personal profit... he can certainly be charged with malfeasance. But... But? Is augmenting hospital operation a breach of trust? How do we know that Dr. Hayami didn't receive personal favors? The evidence... is here. Dr. Hayami handed me every receipt from the supplier. I kept them in this file. It proves Dr. Hayami received no personal patronage whatsoever. Why did you keep them? I told you to shred them. This way, I could order necessary items, too. Such arrogance from thieves! Yeah, the letter names you as a co-conspirator! The issue was exposed from inside ER. So someone must've viewed your behavior as improper. The source... was me. Head Nurse. But why? To fall together. Obviously, your conscience got to you. But you partnered in this crime. We must prosecute this. Director! What action do you propose against Dr. Hayami? There's no need. Resignation Request Excuse the wrinkles. I've had this for years. Wait! You can't just resign and get off scot-free! When I heard of the letter... I felt as though I'd written it. In fact, consider it my accusation. Dr. Hayami is a brilliant physician. But as a manager, he's like a wilIful 3 years old. I refuse to see him go unpunished. He shouId receive... a punitive dismissal. You've still got a lot to learn. ER doctors need to remain calm at all times. Now this issue is settled. I don't know you, but I respect your bravery. So if I may... as Ethics Committee Vice-Chairman... I heneby request the punitive dismissal of ER Chief Hayami... and Head Nurse Hanabusa. Dr. Numata, you aren't qualified to do that. What do you mean? I have another letter here. Reads almost the same but this one was sent to me. As I suspected, the one who sent it... was you, Dr. Numata. I did not write that. I never said you did. It was sent to you, and you forwarded it to me. You hoped it would lead to closing ER. Ridiculous. What proof do you have? Plenty. Right here. So you knew, Mr. Shiratori. When did you realize it? Process of elimination. What in the hell are you talking about? Dr. Numata, it was I who sent you the letter. It then arrived at the Health Ministry. Who else but you would send it? Is this true? Why send a letter damning yourself? I thought it would go to the Ethics Committee, and I'd be dismissed. ER might then be rebuilt. But I didn't expect him to pass it to the Health Ministry. November 11, 2008. Just listen to the audio. Ignore the pictures. I'm in Dr. Numata's office. What about Hayami? ER wilI die. No management sense. Matter of time Dr. Numata, telI me more about your plan. What wouId your "MentaI Care Center" look Iike? Do that later. Almost done. We'll use the vacant 7th floor and clear one more floor... to treat depression, anxiety neurosis, panic and stress disorders. More drug prescriptions and high patient turnover? You could say so. The Mental Care Centen will become the hospital's... most profitable and efficient unit... headed by neuropsychiatrist, Dr. Numata. What floor wilI you clear? We'll shrink ER, Pediatrics and Obstetrics. It's hard to find veteran doctors for those. Legal risks are high. ER is a money pit, and refusing patients damages image. Your biggest pet peeve. Neuropschiatry's a growth sector. Dr. Hayami wilI destroy himself... but it'd be nice to have something decisive to take him down. We'd like you, Mr. Isobe, to go dig up something on him. Where'd you get this? From Mr. Isobe. Dr. Numata, GM Mifune. If we put economic principle over everything, as you say... our health system would crumble. We're fIying over Sakuranomiya City! You can see a coIumn of smoke rising from the expressway. A gasoIine truck has roIIed over and burst into fIammes. The fire has since spread to a nearby shopping malI. There's just been another explosion! Mobilize all hospital staff. Set up triage and call off-duty personneI. Move ICU patients into general wards. All of them? All of them. But victims may go elsewhere. We're overreacting. They're all coming here. Dr. Hayami, status? Summoning all hands, Sir. Understood. I'm putting Dr. Hayami in command. Emergency vehicuIes to main entrance We wilI be cIearing the Iobby to make room for arriving patients. If you must see a doctor today, 2nd floor! Please hurry! If it can wait, please go home! We must clear this area for arriving emergency patients! Not here! Main entrance! That's where they're arriving. Why did Dr. Taguchi have it? Have what? The secret recording. Isobe gave it to her. He told me he didn't give it to anyone. What? Here. This is a bugging device. But it's just a mike. A recording device must be elsewhere. Why do you have that? 'Cause I seized it from Isobe! When? Where? Please stop that! See? Right here! A bugging device! Where's the receiver? Who put you up to this? Dr. Hayami? Does he have the recording? No... no. Really? Really! Truly! So no one has it yet? No. Oh my God. Huh? Bad move? I had to! For the Mental Care Center! What's wrong? They need help downstairs. Who're you calling? You're calling security! Why? Dr. Numata, we're a team! I thought we were a team! Don't do this, Dr. Numata! Don't be so cold, Dr. Numata! You plan on turning me in! Dr. Numata! The poIice let me see Isobe's personal effects. So I went out and bought the same thing. Gets really great reception. Thank you for forwarding the letter, Dr. Numata. For that, I give you credit. "Ethics", my ass. Male, 40s, burn trauma, level 300. Female, 30s, stomach contusion. Male, 20s, multiple wounds, CPA. I don't need the reports! Tell them that! Just bring them! Bring them all! Yes, we're taking them. Taking everyone. Dr. Sato, Deputy Chief! Open the lobby now. Start triage. Wait! Be sure. Your judgment is my judgment. Have confidence. If your hands are free, heIp transport people! You! And you! Come! They'll be coming! Hear me? If you're free, help with transport! Hold on! Doctor! Direct burnsl You're in a hospital. Respiration over 30! Burn trauma, back to feet. Status "Red"! Next! Female 20s, broken leg, vitals stable. You're okay. Next, come on! Chief. Your face is pale. Our leader can't look so pale! I haven' t grown a b i t. That's what it meant. "General Rouge." Careful. Coming through. Can you say your name? It's a hospital. Oxygen 10 liters, 2 PVCs! Triage tags! Is this it? Thanks. What's it for? Prioritizing treatment. Inhalation burn! Red! Red means top priority. Broken ribs, yellow! Yellow means not life-threatening. Green! Green means light injury. No breathing. Black. Black means deceased or beyond recovery. But... A line must be drawn.
