Smoking is injurious to health. It causes cancer. Smoking is injurious to health. It causes cancer. Dear, Roshni and Raja, Though these days letters are out of vogue but could not resist the temptation of inviting you by letter on the occasion of 50th marriage anniversary of your mother and me, the July, we plan to celebrate that special day at our ancestral house, Komolini. 50 years back, I had brought your mother to Komolini as a newly wed wife. At this age, what remains are the past reminiscences. Roshni is yet to visit our ancestral house. These days one always feels that our remaining days are numbered. The rest has assured us that they will come since they all live within the country. So it depends on you to fulfil our dearest wish and make that occasion complete. As always our blessings and love for the two of you. Yours, dad. Left. More. No. Not that much. Why don't you get it? No! Why don't you get it? Come here. Look from here. Do you see which side is off kilter? It's crooked! Will you shut up? Stop poking your nose into everything! Phatik! - Hang on, sister-in-law. Now, what's up? You're off again. Fix this before you go anywhere. I will go after I do it. First, make this right. Then get the big painting from that room and hang it on the outside wall. Phatik! Where are you? Didn't I tell you to get the stuff out from the chest? They will come here. - Now, before you rush off, go fetch the painting and hang them on the outside wall. Really! On the outside wall? - Yes. Alright, off you go. Hey, you. Hey. Yes, you. Come down here. - Me? Come here and do this. They can't hang a damn picture straight. Mom, please see to it he's in bed by nine. You take care. Tell the driver not to drive like a maniac. - Okay. And don't be too late. - No, we won't. Mom, get ice-cream for me. Okay. But only if you don't bother grandma. - Okay. Dad, you too. - Sure! Just like his mother. - Bye. Always ordering! - Well! Blame it on me. Keep the sweets. Careful! Did you get the sweets from Surja Modak's? Could you get the jolbhora? - Yeah! If there an India-wide competition, Surja Modak would rank first. - Okay. Let's go. Have you become their spokesperson? It's not that. Please put the AC on. - Why do you need AC? AC will cost more. - We don't need AC then. We can just roll down the window pane. What is this? This one doesn't roll down? - That doesn't work. Why don't you roll down that one? - No way! I have shampooed today my hair. It will get messy. Nothing will happen. Let some fresh air in. No. - Let some fresh air in. We won't need AC. Strange. Tublu. I am taking these two along. Why? You are not wearing these fine clothes on the way there. What am I suppose to wear? Well, they said that we have to wear Bengali outfits. Am I back in school? People are coming from far away. It will be a close-knit family affair. That's why... Are we from near or far? Just because we live close by doesn't mean... Don't start again. In that case, I will go on my own. Just one evening is all there is to it. Don't make a big deal please. Order has been place. You can't just say no. I am saying no. That's it. What do you mean? - Don't argue with me. Fifty years and we can't get flowers? What's going on here? This man is driving me nuts with these marigolds. What are we going to do with these? He asked me to get flowers from wherever I could. Now, he says, no. And so you got marigolds? See, Hari gave us these Rajanigandhas. I am going to lose money on this, ma'am. Where did these ugly vases descend from? Maybe you can offer these to the gods? Okay, Phatik will take care of how much you owe. Well, Phatik, there weren't any vases less ugly anywhere? These will be in the living room besides the main entrance. I understand but these are very ugly. Joga doesn't have any that are better looking. If I knew about this, I would brought some from my home. Do this. Get us two good quality earthen pitchers. Go on, now! May I say something? I know someone who has recently started a decorator business. Everything he has is all new and shiny. Should I get it from there? - Earthen pitchers. What are you still doing here? I really like Ranga uncle. He is so rich but doesn't show it, no? And his wife, at her age, looks stunning. Their kids, are a bit hoity-toity. By the way, did you keep the bank documents in the drawer? This is the third time I said yes. Documents! That's all you think about. Have we gone our for an outing like this before? Haven't we? Every year, we go to Dakshineshwar temple, the zoo. Damn. That is different. A whole gang packed like sardines. Like now, just the two of us. We haven't done that. I know that you don't enjoy my company on such trips. I can feel it. How about some tea? Should we stop? Driver, stop when you see a tea stall. Tublu, don't stand so close to the door. Where are you? It's going to rain any minute. Why don't you give them a call to see if they have left? It always rains on this day. After all, it's Ulta Rath. What is this? - Take a look. These sepia... These sepia toned photos. Great. Is that all you saw? The sepia tone? Jona! Pass me a cigarette. You still owe me three. You have repaid me yet. I am just requesting for one more. My father-in-law has come. What? What has that got to do... - Hurry up, guys. Phatik, who all are coming? - Why do you care? Listen. Quickly cut the onions. Get the fish ready. The mutton is yet to be washed? Jona, wash the mutton. If the cook finds out you guys are lagging behind, he will lose it. Remember this sari? - Which one? Just take a look. You gifted me this at Mamoni's wedding. It's it beautiful? Hey, come here and see why the string has gotten entangled. What's up? Well, that which happens all too often. Let me see. Now how did this happen? Well, I tried to pull on this side and the other side slid right in. I can't imagine how one makes the same error for fifty years! Hang on. I think I can fix this using my fingers. But if not, I will need a safety pin. Sister-in-law. - Yeah. Come in. Hang on a second. All nicely decorated. - Okay. The day you first stepped into this house, I was just a little boy. I do remember it all though. What's all this? Well, Roshni is stepping into this house for the first time today. We plan to welcome her formally. But back in those days, there used to be a gold coin. Thank heavens! I have managed to untangle the stupid knot. Please don't mess this up anymore. Okay? I have no idea how this keeps happening. Yes, Tonu. You have reached already. Almost there? Okay. Has aunty reached? Superb. See you shortly. Okay. Sister, another surprise for dad and mom. Look. Still have goosebumps just looking at this. It's amazing. Remarkable. They are here. They are here! Hey, you all. Come out to help. Very well. - How are you, Phatik? You are have... - Hey, Roshni. This is Phatik. Oh yes, of course. Come! Welcome. Mom. How are you? Fine. There she is. - Stay well, my dear. Come. - Bless you. Do you know who I am? Stumped? How's she suppose to? She is seeing her for the first time. I am his elder uncle's wife. - Your turn. Oh my. Not me. - Why not? You could have told me. Talk to him. - It's yours, dear. You do it. Let me play the conch shell instead. Oh dear, you are so old-fashioned. Let's begin. You would have done a much better job than me. Exactly. That should be done. What a welcome! With this much fanfare, you should have worn a sari. In that case, you should have worn your traditional Bengali outfit. Mom, you are defending her? - Of course. That's right. You know when she came to our family as a newly wed, she was everyone's go-to person. See? Come inside. - Wait. I don't get a welcome now that the new bride is here? You came alone? Why? I am not enough? Come on in. Hold on a sec. - Why? What's up? Looks okay? Come. The bag? Please bring the bag in. - Okay. Hello, Santosh. Thank you, my dear. That you have brought these red roses for me. You thought about me. I am feeling very, very special. It's not just for you, brother-in-law. It's for the two of you. The wedding involved you both, didn't it? - Really? That may be. But, for now, these roses are mine. Just because I am old, everyone gives me white flowers. - So sad. Your mother couldn't come? Her knee is aching up. And this is a long drive. I didn't want to take any chances. Well, what about your son then? Well, he doesn't budge unless his grandma does. Hey you. You have been told not to put all of it in one go. Jona can fry really well. Jona. Enough. What a shoddy job. You swine. No cussing while cooking. It spoils the taste. Wow! Stairway to heaven. Mom asked us to sleep in here? This room is for our new bride. Why us? You and dad could have stayed here. Are you serious? You think your dad and me can climb those stairs at our age? But still, mom. So fancy. You see. When I joined this family as a new bride, my mother-in-law offered me this very same room. I am merely keeping the Basu family tradition alive. Sister-in-law. - Coming. You two settle down. I am needed there. Who's that old man? Golok uncle. The great cook - Golok. They are our family's cooks. They? Yeah, their entire family. Golok uncle. His father. His father's father. Everyone has to be a cook? What if someone wants to do something else? I suppose, they can. But they take it as their pride. I am repeating myself here. That too a thousand times. I don't know. I don't feel like going over this again. Mamoni! I have to hang up now. Please contact Mr. Panicker. Yes, mom. What's up with you? - Nothing much. Where's dad? - Are you done? The mutton has been marinating for hours. Ask him to start cooking it. Don't bring down the house. All in good time. - Okay. Phatik, what's there? A temple. Highly awakened goddess in there. When folks used to live in that old house, the temple was used a lot. Old house? There. Don't start exploring. Okay? It's forbidden to go there. If the master hears of it... Hey, Pocha. Start frying the mutton. - Yes. It takes time to cook. - I will. He has to rush me with every little thing. Hey there, Pocha. Finish marinating the mutton. You scared me. The hunted. - Why are you freaking her out? I am not freaking her. I am already freaked out, and on top of that you are tapping me from behind. These are old habits. You know, he had locked me in here for a day in our childhood. - Who? Your dear husband. Oh my. You were that cruel? You mean, he has changed now? - What are you wearing? So, Tonu? We were kidding around back then. You know, back in those days, he used to bore the hell out of me. Well, not bore, more like torture. That's not right. - Very bad boy. No! Not really. We were young then. Early teens, maybe. Right? Pompi? - Coming. Now make sure you don't lock your sister up again. You are looking nice. Well, I hear Tonu has brought Surja Modak's sweets. Where are those? Really, brother-in-law. You tell me I am still going strong and you? Not to be left behind. You are aware of everything amidst all chaos. - No, it's not that. My grandfather would routinely get sweets from Surja Modak. - Okay. My father didn't go that far, of course. But he would still on special occasions... Here you go. Surja Modak. - Here. Phatik, all well? Just wow. - Take one. We get this everyday. You don't. Take more. We got this for you two. It's okay. Here. Well, one thing is clear. Jolbhora still has juice in it. Phatik, have you seen Roshni? - No. Sister! Here's your tea. Then go get some rest. It'll be a while before things start. It's 5:30 now. Program starts at 7:30. - Program? What program? - Did you hear that? Now please don't interfere. - Okay. How can it be that we would have no say? Why are you saying that? Why are you saying that? How many are as blessed as you are! - Exactly. I am here after such a long while. This house stands still because of this man. I don't see Tublu around? Where has he gone? You are here? Everyone is looking for you. Why all of a sudden? Tell them I am busy. That doesn't sound nice. I can't be like Tonu, the puny, obedient cat. Why do you say that? There are many there you can talk to. Please go, mom. Why don't you go and talk about the good old day? I am cursed. May I come in? Brother, tea for you. Hey. You didn't have to... - Well, you weren't coming to get it. I was saying... Roshni was wanting to see the old part of the house. I said to make sure that was okay. "I have with me all I have for you" "to offer everything to you." - Parimal. Congratulations, my friend. - What an entry. How are you all? Tonu. - Good! Well, what goodies do you have in the bag of yours? Well, let me figure out who gets the goodies, then I will reveal the what part. How are you? - Same. Because of these two, I get to meet up with people from the past. How are you? - Very fine. Wow. Look at this spread. - Have a seat. Phatik. A round of freshly made tea please. You... - Poka. What is that? - You don't know? She has kept the Po in Porimal Kaka and also the Ka in the end. Hence, Po Ka. Weren't you expected this morning? - Let me take it. You know my unreliability is my strong point. - That I know. I had some work in the morning. By work you mean trying to land a girl? How do you know I don't have a girlfriend? Exactly. How do you know that? - So you are still going strong. Look who's talking. A half century of romance. Great achievement. Manjari. Tenacity, Parimal. Tenacity. - So all the credit goes to her? - No. 80% for her. 20% for you. - What do you mean? Tolerating you for fifty years. What a scary thought. One and half teaspoons sugar for you, right? I was wrong about the 80%. Make it 100%. She still remembers how much sugar I take. That's amazing. - Right, Poka. Roshni? Have you seen Roshni? I am calling her but can't reach her. - Oh my God. Where is she? In this house... - Where were you? I was with brother. Look at that concern. Stop it now. Hey, look where she is. We must look for her. - Hey. Call Phatik. Phatik? Hey, listen. Have you seen Roshni? The new bride. That way? - She went that way. I was back there. She said how beautiful the pond was and then she asked about... Stop talking rubbish. They are saying they saw her go towards the back of the house. - What? Hang on. Back there means... Towards the old mansion. Roshni! Roshni! Roshni! I have repeatedly told you to keep an eye so that no one goes towards the old mansion. Haven't I? - Roshni? You too should have kept an eye on her. It should have been made clear to her from the start. I have gone hoarse reminding everyone not to go there. Does anyone care to listen. Roshni. - In the end, no one listens to an old man until they have to. Now we can't find her. Alright. Stop it now. Relax. No need to get all worked up. She is not a kid... Must be Roshni. - Where are you? Wait there. I am coming. She's near the Khidki pond. You all go back. I am bringing her along. Khidki pond? Strange. Roshni! Roshni! Roshni! What's wrong with you? What happened? Who's that man? Give me some ideas, man. I am stuck. - What do you need? I was thinking mom and dad would sit here. - Sounds good. Then, Aunt can sit here. Should I light those? Yes, sure. Go ahead. And please remove this. - This one, right? Yeah, it's too big. Hey, you. Come here. Hurry up, guys. What else? - And... Hold on, let me tell these folks. Well, take this from here. And turn on those lights. Keep it outside. All the way out. Keep it there. I am thinking. Let's move this piece and bring that here. It creates a nice intimate circle. We can sit here. - That sounds good. We can gather here and have the dinner there. - Yes, absolutely. Does this still work? Lovely. Beautiful. - God knows. It has got a retro feel in it. And the award goes to Phatik. Yes, I am telling you. I haven't done anything. - Who said that? Here, the flowers and the sweets. Do as you please. - You have kept Komolini so well. - You will be awarded. Not only Komolini... Listen, come here. Wait! - What is this? Did you bring the stuff? What's he telling you? - Don't interfere. You just said you will award me. I will tell you what my award will be? - Yes. A huge portrait with brother and sister-in-law. If it's that huge, it won't fit in through the doors. Let me go and hurry them along. Otherwise, the dressing up will never end. - Yeah. Good idea. Let me go too. Phatik. I need your help. - You guys, manage here. I am going. Here, this one. Oh my. You'll need a dozen safety pins to bring this under control, my dear. Pin it all over. It's beautiful. Hey, isn't this your wedding sari? What a remarkable memory. Well, if my husband was around, he would quip that this is limited to saris only. I heard some gossip when you chose such light colours. That much I can recall. Get your petticoat out. What's wrong, mom? You have headache? No, didn't get my nap this afternoon. Where have you been? - I was just here. You should wear this in the evening. Oh my! This is my wedding saree. You had this with you? Yes? - Yes. Yes, ma'am. "Stored it all this while with love and care," "cleaned and buffed for you to wear." You must be crazy, dear. At this age, am I young bride? Wearing a resplendent red? So what, mom? This notion of wearing white age is a very Bengali tradition. Well, I am Bengali after all. And you? Did you bring your wedding saree along? - No, I haven't. Did bring a silk sari though. What is this? Why is your left hand empty? Did you take off your wedding bangle? Mamoni? Earlier today, you managed to leave the Basu family wonder struck. Me? Why? By wandering off to the old mansion. Leave it. Am I not supposed to? - Oh no, dear. Why? - God knows. Something happened a while back. They all left that mention and set up life in this one. That was many years back. What had happened? No need to know. And you have never asked your husband? Listen. This is the Basu family. You and me, we are not part of it. I have heard my mother-in-law bring it up. She was on the phone with someone. Sounded like someone had died there. And not a natural death. Anyway, we are here to celebrate. Why bother? Let's see. P C Chandra Jewellers. All that is good. Oh my. You look stunning. See, even your husband will not recognise you now. Happy anniversary. Here. - Happy anniversary. The bigger one. - No! What are you doing? - No, not such a big bite. Dad, have it. - Let's click a picture. Brilliant. Let me feed you a little. - No, not me. Feed dad a little. He really shouldn't. He is diabetic. - He is only partially diabetic. I give up, really. Open your mouth. Happy anniversary. - Yay. Eat to your heart's content. - Gather around, everyone. A family photo, please. Family photo without you? That makes no sense. Come here. Well, then who will click the photo? How about you, Phatik? No way. Not me. - What will happen to huge portrait? Dad, come. - It's quite easy. The camera is not going to bite you. Move the chair. - No, I can't do it. My eighty year old mother-in-law also can. You can do it. Okay. Show me what to do. - Go, show him. Come here. Okay, since there is no other go... Come here. This side. You two, you look like you were forced to marry each other. What is she saying? - Brother, come here. Aunt. Hang on, everyone. - Okay. Go and stand there. - Stand here. Get us in the frame. Move to your side. - Where are you guys? Okay, ready? One! Two! Three! Yay. - Now mine? Let me see what you clicked. - The huge portrait. Here see. - Come here, Phatik. Are we there in the frame? - Ready? Everyone is there. Okay? Wait. - I can't find Phatik in the frame. Sorry, it's fine. Ready? One! Two! Three! Back in the day, the pomp and glory of this house was simply astounding. Many renowned singers stopped by. The nautch girls would rock the place. They would shoot movies here. - Really? Movies? - You got that right. I've seen it all with my own eyes. The film, Dutta, was shot in this house. The great star, Suchitra Sen, used to stay in that room. What a beauty! What a temper she has. Suchitara Sen? - No! Suchitra Sen. Of Uttam Suchitra fame. Uncle, should I pour some now? - Pour on. After fifty years, there are no secrets, Parimal. - Why not? That means you have some, don't you? Spill the beans! Tell us, Poka. Do you know who accompanied your father for the selection of his bride? - Who? Remember? Yours truly. Of course, I was not alone. His father came along and then there was the potential groom himself. We were sitting around, I looked at the bride-to-be's face. She has this bewildered look. She seemed unsure. Who was she potentially marrying? Your father, he is great man, handsome, confident. He thinks any woman will choose him. - That's right. That any woman can fancy me is beyond his imagination. Hold on. Parimal, are you into doping or is this is the plot of your new novel? - Why? When was it that I fancied you? Well, as they say, a guilty conscience needs no accuser. Did I say that? Did I say that? - Phatik, move aside. You are blocking my view. May I say something? Well, may be not. - Go on. Speak freely. Well, it's really nothing. My mother-in-law did mention that the two of you knew each other before your marriage. Theirs was a sort of love marriage, really. What is this sort of love marriage? Please clarify. Amazing. - I am her son and yet she tells you this but not me. No, she's sort of right. I did - Listen to this. know him a bit during my college days. The marriage, itself, was, well, arranged later. After fifty years, surprises remain. He had just returned from England trained as a barrister at law. And I was a fresher at Presidency College. English was your major, no? - Yes. Don't interrupt please. Go on. - Okay. Your father, he was the heartthrob of every woman in the college. Because he was so handsome. - Great. Well, he still is. - Exactly. Tell them, Parimal. You too used to join us. - Yes. Me, him, Prabal, Asheem, Phulu. - Wait. Would Asheem show up as well? - Yes, of course. He was a student at Calcutta medical college then. Don't you remember? - And then? Those days are right before my eyes. And we girls would all show up as well. Seeing him, my girlfriends would go all weak in their knees. And you? That he was so handsome. No argument there. But I was never that star-struck. - Okay. Dad, did you feel these things? What? That mom was trying to... Let me hear. - You'll get a tight slap. No, listen. Well, such thoughts were far from my mind back then. Exactly. - This is exaggeration. You know, love, romance, and such minor vices, - It wasn't there. emotions, no one was in the mindset for all that. - That's right. He was a careerist, right? His idols were Nehru, Churchill. Careerist, for sure. But not a philistine. He loved poetry. Exactly which year was this? Say 1966. - Yes, '66. Yes. Right. 1966. - We were dreaming of a brave new world. Communist. Dreams of a socialist revolution. - Dad. You know, those hours spent at The Coffee House were so magical. Different believes. Different ways. Even the thoughts were different and that inevitably led to heated arguments. No fighting though. And yet, a day or two later, each of us paid up our college dues and became friends all over again. You hijacked the conversation. What did I do? - Mom was about to say something. Mom, go ahead. What is this? - Don't talk. About your father? Here. Welcome. - Thank you. Thank you. - Well, I noticed him at The Coffee House mainly. We had never been formally introduced. He was a bit senior, frankly. Then, one fine day, a match came from his family. My uncle's son was his father's client. - Did they ask you first? In those days, no one bothered. Not back then. Almost blind. Well, my uncle mentioned that the would be groom was planning a visit soon. I knew they were looking for someone worthy. But I didn't know it would be him. One thing is true, though. Had I objected, no one would force me into a marriage. In that sense, they were very progressive. We have now heard your side of the story, mom. Now, dad, your side. My side of the story? One day, out of the blue, my father said, listen up, coming Sunday you are going to see this girl. He is acting well. Just like legendary Chhabi Biswas. His dad. He was a sample. We called him Hitler. - Don't listen to this. He always treated me with affection. Mom? What was your thought when you first saw dad? Finally, an important question. Correct. You couldn't come up with a better question. - Really. To be honest, I was a little afraid. No! - What? Not after seeing him. You see, in those days, there was no looking back. I mean, once you committed, that was for life. - Fair. Now, may I say something? - Please. Do you know how I felt when I first saw her? I don't know how to put it... A feeling of contentment. Delight. But what was that exactly... He had no clue what that meant. - Love at first sight, dad? Pure bliss. Elder sister-in-law wants you downstairs. Phatik, does Prahlad uncle live there all alone? We are not allowed to go there. And... Ranga Babu sends some money through me each month. How much money exactly? 500! Just 500. So everyone can sleep well at night. Tell me something. Never mind. Well, Phatik. Have you ever wondered how a man can live on like this after such an incident? You know everything there is to know. I am an ordinary servant. See you. "I longed to forget you" "but could not." "I longed to forget you" "but could not." "Your memories, "like shadows," "left me not." "I longed to forget you" "but could not." "You could never grasp" "how it burns to be apart." "Dream garlands, once of flowers," "wilted, now of thorns." "The pain of losing you is" "a shroud on my being." "I longed to forget you" "but could not." "I longed to forget you" "but could not." - Take the camera closer to her. Simply wow. A Pratima Bandopadhyay special. Wonderful! You continue to sing so well. I bet she practices secretly. - No. Oh come on. Of course, there was a time when I did train regularly. Once Tublu's father passed away... You are simply brilliant. Too bad we won't hear Tublu sing. That boy loves music. On whose orders are the front gates open? Biju, Narayan, ask Kameshwar to bring 20 soldiers. Who has turned on the chandeliers without my permission? Who? Our man has gone crazy again. Make sure he doesn't get an entry. This morning, I ran into him. He was cussing like crazy. Remember that broad who went in there... But she was such a doll. Shut up. Show some respect for the new bride! He didn't even bother to ask. I don't get it. Prahlad uncle. Can you recognise me? We meet after a long time. I saw Tublu after a long time. I do understand. I am coming back on Wednesday. Yeah. But tell them that I will be there by... So send a mail. Yeah, send them on Monday. And tell them I will be back. Wednesday. Bye. I will land on Tuesday night. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I will talk to you tomorrow. Bye. Pass me a cigarette. Give me a drag. You remember what a drag is. Yes, I remember it all. Come on now. A drag. - This one? This contains... What? Laced with pot? Good. Even better. Pass it. Where did you get this? - Phatik. I had asked him to procure some from before. Bravo! What is Tublu up to these days? The same job as before. Is this the one with a low salary? How I struggle to make both ends meet, I know and so does the Almighty. Didn't he land a job with the law firm in Kolkata? He didn't take it up? I can only share this with you. He has his father's stubbornness. Refused to take that up because your husband had recommended him. He didn't bring it up with me. But you know, I am his mother. I get it. You misunderstand him and that hurts you. Fact is, he needs you everywhere he goes. Is he keeping up with the singing or has he left it? His whim. Once he gets going, won't stop all day. Even forget to shower and eat then. If someone were to ask him to sing, that's it. Say at a community function. A firm no. Well, he did show up today. Cares deeply for his cousins. Doesn't show it though. You know, it's been a while. I have been playing this game. Game? Sometimes, I shut off everything. I shut out my life. I mean, my work, Bombay, family. Forgetting everything, I think of my childhood. Me too. Is that so? It brings solace, doesn't it? Exactly. Just like meditation. A cathartic feeling. Like when we would all descend here for the summer holidays. Palpable excitement all around. Packing everything the night before. All my dolls. Mom would be on my case for that. She'd say, do you really need to bring a suitcase full of dolls? Remember? How can I forget? Of course. My cricket gear. And the ball. Those cricket matches in the afternoon. Dad, grandpa. Phatik and his antics on the field. Spreading both his hands. - Yes, right. Oh my God. Exactly. Oh my God. You guys... A brother sister meeting in progress? Mom, I am feeling really good. Come sit, mom. Some wine? - That sounds great. Was missing it. Not in front of everyone. - Have it. You know, we were reminiscing. - Is that so? Look at me. You live in Mumbai and he lives in America. All I have are those memories. She was born. Then you. School admissions, high school exams, university. Then came the weddings. And soon I became a grandmother. How time flew. Why the rush to become grown-ups. Who asked you to? Mom. May I say something? - Go on, dear. Never mind. - Why never mind? Is it about Souren? What are you doing here all alone? Listen, there is something about this room. Believe me. I mean... I think 10 days back. 10 days back, I saw this room in my dream. How many glasses of wine before that? You don't believe me, right? - Okay. Fine. I believe you. Go on. I don't remember exactly what I saw. But... Trust me. It was the same room, you know. Let me tell you what exactly you saw. You saw me locking you up in this room and I will tell you why. You knew we were all coming here. We'd all be together. That's why you saw this room. Actually, this room is a symbol of our shared childhood. Absolutely, Mr Freud. But I didn't tell your wife why you locked me up in this room. She would be shocked. Tublu? Where were you? I was with Prahlad uncle. Was chatting with your mother. Listen, Tublu. It's time for you to settle in to a nice job in Kolkata. You remember we would walk down that path? You, me and Sajal. We'd sit there and Sajal would teach me how to play a folk instrument. Recall any of this, aunty? Tell me something. When I was young, I would want to put on your nail polish, your lipstick. You wouldn't let me and that made me mad. I would lock you up here. What is so shocking about this? Boys don't want to put on nail polish, lipstick. That's not natural. The grown-ups would mind. That's why I didn't give you those things. Yes, but... What is there to get shocked? At what? - A minute ago, you said, your wife, if she found out, would get shocked. Let it go. Tell me, how are you? Good question. How am I? So, I wake up in the morning, take a shower, eat, etc. Catch the 8:26 train to Howrah. A bus to office. If the boss is in a good mood, then great. Otherwise, bad day. Then either the 5:20 or 6 pm train, back to my burrow. Make nice with the wife. Son's upcoming exams. Office picnic. Once a year, around the time of the puja, rent a car and go nuts idol-hopping. A middle class existence on a conveyor belt. All this is hard for you to understand. Your trajectory is a bit higher than mine. Does that make it any easy? Hold on. Let me track down your father. You see, every man needs his own private space. Primal need for privacy. A word missing from our middle class dictionary. What have you been seeking, Tonu? Remember when we used to visit this place for the summers? You would go on and on about your future. Going abroad. Living in New York. Couldn't muster enough courage. You had decided to take out the mole by operation. What happened then? I didn't have the guts not even to get that simple thing taken care of. I always wanted to run away from here. Off to a place where no one knew of me. No one to force me to play soccer or study commerce or get married or have kids. I don't get you, Tonu. - Why not? I can only bring these up with you. You ought to understand. I have never been turned on by women. Not back then, not now. Boys, yes. But I would find it crude. I would realise I was different in some way. I... I am not sure I follow. What are you trying to say? I know you understand. It's just that you are scared to even articulate it, right? Then, Rintu? - Rintu's my son. He is. But for that to happen... Doctors, Ayurveda, astrologers, chants, shamans. There were times I would want to commit suicide. Just didn't have the guts. Pompi. Nothing will change. It will stay the same as before. You must admit that I have neglected my duties as your husband or as Rintu's father. Have I? And I won't in the future. Will Rintu end up like you? Like me? What are you talking about? - Don't touch me. You are sick. You need to see a doctor. Our forefathers, as the lineage expanded, set up three different establishments. The first one was abolished, the second inspired by Mughal times, and the third and the last one was called Flower Gardens mansion. It was constructed by Rajabahadur Mohanlal Basu. The construction was overseen by himself during British times. Along side, there was a summer house, a bungalow named Red Hut more like a mansion. Raja Mohanlal Basu. In 1913, he earned the title of Rajabahadur from the British. This is our blood. So, a toast to our forefathers. Enough now. Spare her the details of the glorious past of this family. Instead, please come and sit by me. Come. Sit here. Phatik! How pretty she is, our new bride. It's been a while. So when do we see some grand kids? That's it. Here comes the familiar attack. Don't delay. As mothers, you too have some responsibilities, don't you? I will be right back. Just spare my son out of this. Okay? Don't indulge him in this dirt. Don't compel me to be nasty. I warned you just, Souren. Just shut up! Having a fight? Mom, will you please come and sit? The day went so beautifully after such a long time. You know, mom, I could share so many stories with brother after such a long time. Parimal uncle, brother, Tonu and all of you. I had so much fun today. I failed. I failed, mom. I failed. Sometimes, you know what I feel? Just give it all up and come and live with you and dad in Kolkata. - Do that. Who's stopping, sweetheart? We are here for all of you. You think, just because you are all grown up, working that you are no longer our sweetie? You know, mom? I had decided not to attend this. The past few days, a nightmare. But I had to come. This means something to me. This is special to me. You know? - This place, right? This place... I felt it's as if... you and dad as if you are the Paragon of... - Paragon. Leave all this. Fifty is just a number. Come. Let's go and join others for dinner. I'll take you, come with me. Will you carry me, mom? - Yeah sure. Roshni. Please tell me, what's wrong? Roshni, what's wrong with you? Roshni? Listen to me. Roshni, please! Please tell me what happened. Why the hell is everyone concerned about me not having a child? - Who has spoken these words? First, your sister. Now, aunty. What's their problem? It's my life. - Just calm down. You are just overreacting. I am overreacting? So you think this is fine? I am not saying this is fine. So, what are you saying may I know? - Don't shout. Why shouldn't I shout? Should I tell everyone? Should I? - What do you want to say? That it's your bloody defective sperms. Just shut up. - Why should I shut up? Am I saying something wrong? Everyone should know that you don't have the guts to have someone else's. - Yes, I don't want to. Rather I have my own blood. Do you understand that? Yes, of course. The Royal Blood. The Royal Blood my foot. Just like a father. The blood flows... Don't utter a single word. Come now. Come. Let's go get some. Raja, come join for dinner. Please don't mind if I exaggerate a bit. Okay? You see. Do you know what makes me so happy? That you are all so busy. That in spite of all your commitments, all of you came. That you cared. This is what gladdened me the most. We are all aware this is the era of nuclear families. Everyone is scattered, dispersed, disbanded. Everything has changed. Take this house, for instance. This was such a happening place when the entire Basu clan lived under this roof. This special day. This anniversary. It's just an excuse, really. This excuse is... Hello. What? No, we are not returning tonight. We'll be back tomorrow morning. No, I didn't get drenched. My throat is a bit scratchy. Give him the phone. Yes, dear. No. We are not coming home tonight. Be a sweetheart and go off to bed. We'll be there when you get up in the morning. Okay? Yes, dad will be there as well. Do you want to talk to him? Hold on. Yes, dear. We will be there. We'll bring candy. Off to bed, now. Okay, honey? We'll talk later. So sorry. Roshni, why are you so far from me? Come closer. Come. Come. You belong here. Next to him. This place is vacant. - Go on. What were you saying? No, not much left to say. Just that, she's been on my side these fifty years. That is my biggest award. I feel so contented today. And I know you think of me as traditionalist. So as a traditional, let me say, those starting on life's journey, I am reminded of something. The bearded bare Tagore said, Life's up and downs, live through them with a smile. Fill your heart forever with honey from Him stream. Beautiful. Let's begin. Tublu, have this. It's good. - Take some more. I know you like chicken. Start with that. After all, this is your first visit to this house. Another cause for celebration, isn't it? Don't feel down. It'll be okay. - Pompi. Not returning home tonight. Did your mother-in-law scold you for that? Why this long face? Eat up. - I am. The cooking is fantastic. In that case, shouldn't you be taking some more food? I am. Want some salad? - So, what do you call this fish dish? It's probably not fish. - What is it then? Minced fish ball. A signature dish in our family. Go on, describe it for him. You tell them. - Amazing dish. Take this. - Oh my God. What are you doing? Crazy, giving a widow fish to eat? Sister, why do you hold on to all that? No one does anymore. - I am sorry, dear. I do. Don't do that. - I don't eat it. Finish up your drink soon. - Yes, I am just... Now you also come and eat. - Yes. Coming. Brother-in-law, one shouldn't sing at the dinner table. People go bonkers. - No. He can't go more crazy than he already is. - Actually, I was singing for you folks. Since I am the known devil, no one appreciates me. Phatik, make sure that the chauffeur and the help get to eat as well. - Okay. Look at this. - I mean to say one should retain the kid within. - Why aren't you eating, Tublu? Let me serve you. - It will be done. Here. Manjari! Hey. What are you doing here? They are having dinner. Let's go now. Why all this feasting if Prahlad can't join in? Who the hell are you guys? What kind of feast is this? No dancing. No music. You call this a feast. Am I new in Komolini? - Who let this man in? Hadn't I been clear... - I invited him. He wanted to meet aunty. - Come, uncle. Let's go. No, Pranab. Do you have that piece of paper? You know, when someone dies, they give you a piece of paper from municipality. Do you have that for Sajal? - Phatik. It's okay. I will be on my way. Fact is, I have been wanting to visit Manjari. I was saying to Tublu... You recall, Manjari? You, Sajal and Tublu, you would hang out all day together. Sajal used to sing. Those memories are all I have. What can I say, Prahlad? I don't have the face to ask you how you are doing. - This little kindness from you, I don't need to hear anymore. - Come, let's go. The chandelier has one bulb missing and no one seems to care. Who was Sajal? Tell us, uncle. Not in the middle of dinner. - Please, aunty. You of all people, don't say a word. Let uncle tell us, who is Sajal? Stop it. Tublu. Let uncle describe honours and traditions of this family. Tublu. You'd like to know who is Sajal, right? Sajal... He is Prahlad uncle's only son. Who was... You are trying to whitewash away everything. That old man created a lot of inconvenience, right? The picture perfect family... This is not the right time to talk about all this. Don't forget your place, kid. Those phrases in English will not exonerate your father. All this lording about... This fragile aristocracy. The true face is that old mansion. Where Prahlad uncle spends years, rotting and waiting for his son. The son this Basu family... You kicked him away from home, uncle? You felt no hesitation whatsoever? Tublu. Please stop. - Let go off me, mom. Tell me, why did you guys stop coming to this house? Tublu. - No need to tell me. Tell the new bride. I don't want to hear another word against my father. Hey, listen, brother. - Shut up, brother. Calm down. Let me handle this. Sajal's death was an accident. Accident? Is that so? You had claimed you were abroad at that time. So how did you find out? Via a phone? Brother, please. Mom, take care of aunty. Please come. Wash up. Come with me, please. - I am good. I am fine. - Tublu, please listen. Sister. Shame on me. Please forgive me, everyone. What are you saying? Every family has its own drama. It's okay. - He really didn't want to come. Had I not insisted, maybe things would be better. After his father passed away, he took Sajal. I want to go travelling with Sajal. He is going to give me voice lessons. I will go fishing with him. Fly kites together. I remember. Remember it all. After the incident with Sajal, he changed completely. I think he had figured it all out. "My friend, where is he?" "This separation" - Isn't that Tublu? "burns me up." "It burns me up" "wherever I go." "My friend." "Where is he?" "Where? Where?" "Me, I will perish," "separated from him" "wherever I go." "Where is he," "my friend?" "My friend." "Only had I known," "that we would get separated." "Only had I known," "that we would get separated." "Then I would have made sure" "that I never let him go." "Where is he, my friend?" "Where is he," "my friend?" "My friend." "I tell my friend" "that I am" "burning from inside." "My heart is aching, my friend." "Where is he?" "Where is he," "my friend?" You haven't turned the lights on? The rains did come as predicted. Fifty years. It's a long period of time. And yet, too short. How did all this time manage to escape? Hmm. What do you mean, hmm? Manjari, fifty fifty years is enough time to understand the meaning of hmm. Fact is, I can't get that song off my mind. Song? You mean the song Tublu was singing? He has always been a good singer. Just like his dad. Just like Sajal. He picked the song up from Sajal. Really? From Sajal? The first few months after marriage when I came into this mansion, I was very lonesome. Of course, everyone showered me with affection. Your father, your brother and sister. And yet, there was this... And these were days when you spent most of your time in Kolkata. Sajal, he had this earthly quality to him. We would go for walks near the pond. Pluck mangoes and flowers. And sing together. Me, Sajal and Tublu. Though I knew I was the bride of the lord's family and he was a son of a commoner. Still. Honestly, Sajal had such an amazing voice. He left me mesmerised. Then suddenly one day, you told me we were to leave for England immediately for your work. Once he heard the news, Sajal broke down. He would say, Manjari, if you leave, who will I sing for? And then, the night before we were to leave, it was Ulta Rath that night as well. It was raining much like tonight. The boy stayed up all night through the rain soaked to his skin, singing to me. The song that Tublu was singing tonight, that one. Not once did I come to the window. I somehow knew he was there, waiting for me. Even then I didn't. Not even for once. All of a sudden, hearing that song again... Not out of the blue, Manjari. As in? The decision to leave for England. It wasn't something I decided all of a sudden. I knew. What did you know? There had been some gossip. Some of it reached my father. There was talk of needing to protect the family heritage. Besides, I had seen the two of you together. How come you've never brought it up? I didn't. The reason being pride. The new bride of this family being seen with an ordinary caretaker's son. I couldn't bring it up. In fact, I wounded my self-esteem. After that... - You never understood me. - I decided without asking you to leave for England. And because of all this, if someone kills himself. Surely, I am not to be blamed. That crime, that's not on me. But you said that he fell from the roof top of the old mansion and it was an accident. Manjari. Fifty years has gone by. All these while, things have been fine. Things were all fine? Really? Souren, well, if you don't object, maybe... This winter, you and me... Together... I mean... Can we go and get Chiku? So it rained after all. Well. It is a well known fact that it rains on this auspicious day of Ulta Rath. The day when Sajal stood outside the window for Manjari and drenched himself in the rain, was it raining like this as it is today? The call of death which pulled Sajal, was it due to his unrequited love for Manjari? I don't know the answers to these questions. But this much I could realise today that we may remain entangled in this small circle of life. But that has no effect on the rhythms of nature. Even a curse from the past comes and haunts us as if to remind us that in this vastness of life, there is a truth that is beyond the personal trials and tribulations of mankind. The fact that after 50 years of married life with Manjari, I can realise this ultimate truth. That is my real cause of celebration today. The fragility of my pride of our ancestry, the fading pride of a nebulous past. Even the crevices in my apartment, success makes me realise today. A realisation much larger than all that embraces me, and the rain, as if, serves as a reminder to all this. "It's raining." "The clouds are pouring." "It's the monsoon season." "Cool breeze is flowing." "It's raining." "It's raining." "The clouds are pouring." "The lightning strikes." "The lightning strikes." "The wind is flowing." "The lightning strikes." "The lightning strikes." "The wind is flowing." "It's thundering loudly." "It's raining." "The clouds are pouring." "It's the monsoon season." "Cool breeze is flowing." "It's raining." "The clouds are pouring." "It's the monsoon season." "Cool breeze is flowing." "It's raining." "The clouds are pouring."
