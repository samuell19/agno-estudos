♪ Everywhere you go ♪ ♪ Take a look in the five and ten ♪ ♪ Glistening once again ♪ ♪ With candy canes and silver lanes aglow ♪ ♪ It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.. ♪♪ Anyway, these two passengers were the nicest most upstanding people ever that you could imagine. But there they were, like two little kids fighting over an armrest. So, what did you do? What could I do with the Christmas travel season in full swing? I negotiated a truce over Tulsa and by the time we made it to St. Louis they had a date planned for New Year's Eve. Sydney, you're a legend. What can I say? I know how to deal with even the most troublesome travelers. Wow! What is the rush? 'I never understand why people get so crazy' at this time of year. Uh, maybe 'cause not everyone jets off to some amazing corner of the world every Christmas. I mean, what is it for you this year jingle bells in Jamaica, or.. No. It's fruitcake in Finland. - A bikini in Bali. - 'Ah! Sydney! Argh!' I know, all I have to do is just make a few tight connections after this last flight and I will be on a white, sandy beach until New Year's. You're my hero, I think. Why not? A book and a beach chair in the tropics suits me just fine. Oh, boy! Oh, we should catch our flights. Taxi! - Hi, Ted. I'm here for 3:25. - Great! Sydney, you have an unaccompanied minor into Chicago. - Uh, she just cleared security. - Okay, great. Thanks. By the way, my spies in HR said your interview went great. Fingers crossed. I know they're gonna make the decision soon. A posting in Rome would open up a whole new continent to you. Let's just hope that my dream job isn't just a dream, you know? I mean, everybody wants Rome. Yeah, but not everybody's learning Italian and working as hard. I mean, if anyone deserves it, it's you. Kerry, if I don't see you before Bali, Merry Christmas. Same here, think of me when you're relaxing on some tropical beach and I'm working the red-eye to Topeka. - Oh. - See you soon. - You bet. - Okay. - Safe travels. - Thank you. Thanks, Ted. - 'Buon Natale.' - Buon Natale. Buon Natale. Buon Natale. 'This is my first time travelling alone.' 'Now, we're ready to go to Chicago' because the most important passenger on the flight just arrived. This is Leah, she's flying home to dad after seeing her grandparents. Hi, Leah. My name is Sydney. It's nice to meet you. She's a little nervous. Thanks, Ted. I've got it from here. You don't look that nervous to me. In fact, you look like someone who knows that her private flying carpet is ready to take her home. 'Let's get you settled.' And your backpack. Thank you. So, how was your visit with your grandparents? Pretty good. Yeah? I bet your grandma made you all your favorite food. And your grandpa probably told you lots of funny stories? Well, mine won't be quite as good. But I can get you food and tell you stories too if you'd like, just after all the rest of the passengers take their seats, okay? And then, later, when the seatbelt sign goes off we can go upfront and take a peak at the view. Yeah? Now, we may not have Santa's reindeer power under the hood but how would you like to fly almost as fast? Buckle up, okay? I'll be right back. - Hello. How do you do? - 'Hello.' 'So, Leah, what's your favorite part of Christmas?' 'I think decorating the tree.' 'In that case, I have an idea.' I bet you we have the only Christmas tree at 35,000 feet. Unless Santa had one on his sleigh. But I doubt there's room with all the presents. That's a good point. But I like the way you're thinkin'. Sydney, what does.. ..."UM" mean? "UM" means Unaccompanied Minor. Or a kid that's brave enough to fly all by herself. Dad wanted to come. But he had a deadline from his editor at the paper. Oh. Wanna see the Christmas present I made him? I do. I made it for him with grandma. I hope he likes it. Oh, he is gonna love that. 'It's beautiful. What a treasure.' You must have had a great visit with your grandparents. Yeah. I even got to try my mom's old roller skates. Oh, wow. My mom's an angel now. Hey. You know what? My mom's an angel now, too. But she's always watching over me just like your mom's always watching over you. And speaking of angels you know what our Christmas tree needs? Wings. 'Some wings.' - What do you think? - It's perfect. It is perfect. Alright, Leah, I have to do the food service now. In the meantime, why don't you just enjoy the view? Hurry, Sydney! Hurry! Wow, you're even faster than I am. Excuse us. I didn't even think that was possible. - Daddy's not here. - No? Well, I'm sure it's just a delay. Hang on, one second. Excuse me, I know you've got your hands full. I just have a UM here. She's supposed to be meeting her dad. Have you heard anything? Just got a text. Security's backed up. He'll be here soon. Hopefully. Security's backed up, so it'll just be a little bit longer, okay? No worries. You've got to catch another flight, don't you? I do. I'm sorry, sweetheart. Just slide me her paperwork and park her in that chair. - I'll do the hand-off. - 'Okay. Thank you.' Oh, oh! - Let me help you. - Oh, come on. - 'You see him?' - 'No.' 'Oh, there we go. Um..' You know what? I'm feeling pretty exhausted from losing at hearts to you all day. So, um, I think I'm just gonna catch my flight tomorrow. Are you sure? Yeah. I'm telling you, reindeer powered or not there is no way that Santa's sleigh doesn't have landing lights. It's gotta be an FAA rule. What do you say we go and get some hot chocolate while we're waiting on your dad? - 'Mm? Deal?' - Deal. - 'Leah!' - Daddy! Hey.. Hi, monkey. Hey. - Daddy? - Mm-hmm? - You are late. - I know. I'm sorry. My lucky pen's not so lucky today. I forgot I had it in there, and it kept settin' off the metal detector. - Oops. - Daddy's a reporter. - Oh, is that right? - Uh.. And this is my new friend, Sydney. 'She sat with me the whole flight' and gave me a front-row seat. Wow! That was sure nice of her. 'And, we played foosball with peanuts' and we built a Christmas tree out of coffee stirrers and sizzle sticks. We did. Swizzle sticks, we did. Yeah, it's perfect, I figured as much. Um, I know this sounds crazy, but I do need to actually ask you for a photo ID before the airline can officially release this little charmer. Thank you. Jonathan Murphy. - It's official. - Alright. Thanks so much for taking care of Leah. I mean, the holidays can be kind of a tough time for us. So... you really put a smile on her face. Oh, sure. It was my pleasure. She was great. Leah, you have a Merry Christmas, okay? You all set, kiddo? Actually, daddy Sydney and I were just going to get hot cocoa. Can we still get some? Well, uh, actually, I have a lot of work to do. We got the family comin' over tonight, so.. Yeah. And I have to get a hotel room, right? - Daddy, where's Bali? - Bali? Um, Asia, I think. Why? 'Cause Sydney missed her flight to Bali for me. Bali? Really? Are you kidding? - I'm so sorry. - Oh, no. It's okay. You told me always to say thank you when people are nice. Don't we at least owe Sydney a cocoa thank you? Yeah, cocoa it is. No, you really don't have to do that. - Oh, trust me, I do. - He does. Okay. You're havin'.. You're gettin' a cocoa. Apparently, I am. Okay. Okay. All checked in. This hotel always holds a few open rooms for flight crew which is lucky for us because the restaurant serves the best hot chocolate around. I'll say. Mm. Oh, boy! It might be very good. - Slow down. - 'Daddy, look at this..' Rocket fuel. 'That's okay. She's good.' - Yeah, I can see her. - Okay. So, you're a reporter? Uh, I'm a columnist now, uh, these days but I used to be an investigative reporter. Um, then, I needed to work from home more so I started a column in the paper instead. Oh, really? What's it called? It's called "Scouter Stories." Great excuse for me and Leah to get out and chase down adventures all over the city. Pretty cool. But right now, I have a new editor, and, um she wants to use the space for ad sales, so I'm like.. If you see beads of sweat on my forehead it's because I've got writer's block and a deadline for a great Christmas story this week. I totally get it. If I miss a deadline, 300 people might miss their vacations. Right. I'm sorry about the whole Bali situation. Oh, no. It's fine. I'm sure I can fly out tomorrow with a few creative connections. Ah, Christmas in Bali, that's.. - Yeah. - It's cool, but, um.. Are you gonna miss a regular Christmas? Oh, gosh. Not a chance. No. It's the best time to travel. Christmas day, the airports are a breeze. But caroling and.. ...snowball fights and the snow, I mean.. Come on. I guess Christmas just isn't really that big of a deal to me. And I like how no two days are ever the same. I like two days the same, if they're good days. But don't you miss, like, adventure? Oh, I think I've got enough adventure with this little monkey. So, um, where do you call home? I live in California. But, uh, actually, I was born and lived here in Chicago until I was six. - Local girl. - Yeah, I guess. - What part of the city? - North side, maybe. - Does that make sense? - Yeah. But, uh, do you know what school you went to? Uh.. Any other details? Streets? Uh, I'm not really sure. Details are kinda hazy. Do you remember any stores you went to? Sorry, I'm totally grilling you. That's, uh.. Sorry. Old reporter habits die hard. No, no, it's fine. I carry gum for takeoff and landing. - Even when I'm not flying. - Wait a minute. Um, can't your parents tell you where you lived? Uh, no. They passed. Oh, I'm sorry. That's okay. I grew up with my grandparents in California. So, Chicago is pretty much a blank slate. It's a great place. Yeah, I mean, I'd love to see it more. You know, if I, uh, was ever here for long enough. Actually, my parents met here over Christmas time. - What? Really? - Yeah. Uh, how? I don't really know the details, actually. Not even a clue? I mean.. Uh, can you.. I'm just desperate for stories. Especially, this week. But it sounds great. Did your grandparents ever.. Uh, I'd love to help you. I, um, I know my grandparents said that they met here during college. And, um.. Oh! - Actually.. - Mm-hmm? Uh, this is from the Christmas when they met. 'Uh, yeah, there's pictures of them in here from that time.' I've always been really curious about more of that story. - 'But, uh..' - Well, yeah. I'm sorry, it's.. It's probably too much information. No, no, no. Not enough information. Um, do you mind? Can I see the photos? Oh. Uh, no, I'll show them to you. Hey, don't break it on my account. There we go. Uh, that's mom and dad. Wow! Cool photos. Oh, sorry. Uh, the ghost of deadlines future. I should probably grab Leah and get out of here. - Yup. - Hey, buddy, you ready? Coming, dad. Leah, I feel like I'm always saying goodbye to you. Then, let's say it in another language this time. That's a great idea. - Arrivederci. - Ooh, what's that? I put in for a job posting in Rome so I've been brushing up on my Italian. - Fingers crossed. - Arrivederci, Sydney. Very good. Well done. - Et Buon Natale. - What's that? It means, "Merry Christmas." You have fun with your cousins, okay? I will. Bye, Sydney. Bye, sweet girl. And good luck with your deadline. Thanks. Enjoy your tropical Christmas. Will do. What if I connected it through Oakland and then, I hopped to the Bali flight from SFO? 'Sorry, Sydney, but between the weather and the holidays' 'right now, it's all completely full.' 'Look, let me check around and try to work some magic, okay?' - 'I'll call you back.' - Okay, thanks for trying, Anya. I owe you big time. Oh, no. Hey, Anya. It's Sydney again. 'Can I borrow your computer skills one more time?' I-I need to track down a passenger. It's important. Wow! These people are not kidding around. Hang on a sec. There's someone at the door. - Hi. - Hi. S-Sydney, what are you doing here? I'm so sorry, I tried calling but your phone kept going to voicemail. Uh, yeah, my editor keeps calling. Oh, I'll be quick. I just have something of Leah's. Oh. I'll call you right back. - Sorry. - No. - Hi. - Ooh, Sydney. What's that? Something special that I thought you might be missing. - Sydney, you found it! - 'Yeah.' Is that my gift for daddy? Yeah, I think somehow it got into my things when your bag spilt. You wrapped it up so pretty. Actually, the concierge at my hotel wrapped it up so pretty, because gift-wrapping is not my specialty. Oh, my gosh. Thanks for running it all the way down here. For goodness sakes, Jonathan, invite the poor girl in. Oh, uh, right, yeah. He's totally right. You should come in. We're just trimming the tree. No, thank you so much. I have a cab waiting. Uh, not anymore. Oh. Look, come in. Have an eggnog. I'll call you another cab. - Oh.. - Come on in, Sydney. Let's have some fun. Why not? 'Ooh, what's going on here?' Getting ready for Christmas, of course. Yeah, my family's like a human advent calendar. We throw an event every day leading up to Christmas. Today is tree-decorating day at my house. Oh, gosh, look. - I don't wanna intrude. - No, no, no. You're not intruding, you're saving the day, actually. Leah's been upset ever since she unpacked. Now I know why. Well, between you and me, she worked really hard on her present for you. Oh, we don't do Christmas halfway in this family. I noticed. Uh, so any word on the Borneo flight? - Uh, Bali. - Bali. I'm just waiting on a jump seat. I'm expecting a call any minute. Oh, I gotta take this. Actually, this is my editor. Uh, meanwhile, Leah will give you a tour of the house. - Hey.. - Merry Christmas. - Oh! - Ho-ho-ho! Welcome. - That was Uncle Arthur. - Okay. And that's daddy's sister Robin, over there. Great Aunt Linda will be here soon. Oh, there are my two cousins. And here's Grandma Fiona. - And Grandpa Tom. - Oh. You must be that lovely angel that Leah's been telling us about. She hasn't stopped talking about that nice flight attendant she met on the plane. So, uh, Sydney, are you married? Of course she's not married. Do you see a ring? Not all married ladies wear rings. And how do you know that? And not all married ladies are suspicious every time their husband opens their mouth. My parents made a promise never to go to bed angry so they've usually been awake for three days straight. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - I see. Sydney, we could use more hands here to string popcorn. This one eats more than he threads. Sorry, I know. My family can be a bit much. They're fine. Merry Christmas! Oh, I missed you all! Hey, Aunt Linda. You actually don't know her yet. Hi. I'm Sydney. - Linda. - Nice to meet you. Hi, everybody! Hello! So nice to see you guys. Um, uh.. I'm gonna call you that cab right now. - Okay. - Yeah. - 'Oh, get it up there.' - 'Yeah.' Okay, and.. Perfect! Ta-da! Oh, except I think I strung the lights with the plug on top. You don't happen to have an outlet in the ceiling or.. - No. Don't. - I'm not very good at this. I don't really do traditional Christmas. - No? - 'No, not my thing.' That was kinda obvious. Um.. I think we're just gonna blame it on the jetlag, uh.. Yes. Oh, uh, I think that's your cab. And I'm gonna go in it before I do any more damage here. So, thank you guys so much. It was nice meeting you. Ah-ha! There's the airline calling now. Hi, Anya. What's the word? Mm-hmm. Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, just let me know, um, if anything changes. - Thank you. - Uh, success? No. No luck yet. Seems that, uh, every jump seat to Bali is booked until Christmas. Jonathan, we can't have her stranded over Christmas. Oh, no, really. I'm totally fine. I have tons that I can do while I'm here. I've got my Italian tapes and, uh, trust me, I could use the practice. But, um, a seat will become available anytime. - Yeah? - Yes. No, really. Okay, uh.. I-I think maybe we could help each other out. - How's that? - I need a story. And you've got a story. You know, how your parents met on Christmas. Yeah, but I mean, I barely even know that story. No, I know. That's what's so interesting about it. And you said that you wanted to see more Chicago when you had the time. - 'Yeah, but... ' - 'Well, now you've got time.' Look, hometown girl tracks down her parents' holiday romance. That is perfect for my Christmas column. - Are you serious? - Absolutely! Yeah. Romantic story set against the backdrop of Christmas. Plus, you said, you, uh, wanted a little adventure. Of course. But I mean, I wasn't.. - I didn't mean like... - Okay. Full disclosure, I've already pitched the idea to my editor who's turned down all my other ideas, and she loves this one. - You did what? - Y-yeah. Sorry about that. But it was a.. Maybe we could have a win-win, okay? I could help you find your story and you could help me, uh, you know, keep my job. - Okay. - Perfect. We'll start tomorrow, I'll go down to the archives at the paper and see if they can find any information on your folks. We'll have to scan those photos in your locket 'cause those are our first lead. - Sydney.. - Oh.. Don't forget these. Can't forget those. Adorable! See ya! Oh, what did I just agree to? Wow! The whole team is here, bright and early! - You still game? - Oh, yeah. I mean, it's either this or practicing my Italian with Lorenzo. Lorenzo? Oh, I downloaded an Italian tutor. And, uh, turns out, he's pretty tough on conjugating verbs. Oh, I see. Um.. Before we get started, Leah has something for you. Since we're gonna be your tour guides while you're here.. - "UG." - Unaccompanied Grown-up. That's amazing! Nice work. Thank you. And I took the liberty of printing this. Uh, so if we can just find where in Chicago these photos were taken I think we can probably figure out where their paths crossed. And I have a pretty good idea where to start. - So, we're actually doing this? - Yeah. Well, I promised my editor a Christmas column and a deal's a deal. It's only my job on the line. Yeah. Okay. Oh, but first things first. - Ready? - Yes. - I'll take that. - Leah, I love my sign. I won't get lost wherever we go. Hey, look, hon. Fruitcakes, right there. We're gonna take a couple of these fruitcakes, okay? What exactly does this have to do with our mission? 'Nothing, my, uh' family's having a dinner tonight at my sister, Robin's house and I know enough not to show up empty-handed. Look, daddy, cuckoo clocks. Leah seems to know her way around here pretty well. Yeah. She's got her mom's energy and kindness. If I can keep up. Here, will you hold these for me, please? - Oh, sure. - Thanks. Oh, hey, can I get three pounds of bratwurst, please? Ew. Bratwurst, huh? - Christmas tradition. - Ooh. To each his own. You ever feel like you're missin' out by travellin' over the holidays? Oh, my gosh. Are you kidding me? I've been to Christmas mass in Salzburg Cathedral and I've seen real reindeer in Russia. I mean, why would you ever wanna stay in one place when you can travel the globe? To celebrate Christmas. But I do celebrate. I just celebrate all over the world. I mean, at the end of the day on the slopes, I come home I've perfected the hotel room Christmas. You can make a Christmas tree out of hangers. You put the little tiny pillow mints underneath. And then, you hang a big old "Do Not Disturb" sign on top. - It's great. - Why am I not surprised? So, no hanging stockings? Out to dry on a balcony in Venice. Or feeding reindeer at a local Santa's village? That I've never done. But I've run with the bulls in Spain. Okay, message received. Hey, Stan, can I get a couple of these wreaths here? And, uh, here. 'I also got a question for you.' You're an arborist, right? Can you tell me what kind of trees those are in the background? I'd say those curved branches are Fraser firs. Do you know anywhere around here that I could get those? Christmas tree lots, but these are rare. I remember one place that sold them. Sorry, it's been years. No problem. Thanks. Okay, not a slam dunk, but we have our first lead. - Fraser firs. - Right. That narrows it down to a larger part of the world. Are you sure that you're an investigative reporter? Oh, so I'm a little rusty. What? Oh, being side-tracked here. Okay, what's your favorite Christmas desert? Mine? Why? Aunt Linda wants to know. So, you don't have dinner plans for tonight. Uh, Lorenzo does not count. No. But I'm not gonna intrude on your family again. I don't wanna go afoul of Aunt Linda. But if you do, that's-that's on you. Oh, well, then we should let the sleepy reindeer lie. That's a smart choice. Besides, my family really likes a good Christmas mystery. They'll probably help us out. Ah, everybody open your Christmas sweaters. You got the wreaths there? - Yeah. - Yeah? Alright. - I apologize in advance. - For what? For whatever's about to happen. Okay. Ooh! Welcome! - Grandma. - 'Oh, honey!' Oh, and Sydney. So glad you could join us. - Come in, come in. - Thank you. Oh, John.. They're here! 'Hey, kids. Come on, sit down, kids.' ♪ Glory to the new-born King.. ♪ Johnny, let, uh, Sydney have the good chair. Okay, okay. Alright. Then I'll scoot over here, and.. Here you go. And, Sydney, sit on my left, 'cause that's my handsome side. You like my, uh, you like my tie? He's had that same festive tie for the past 21 Christmases. - Tradition. - 'Oh, "tradition."' I don't know if you've noticed, but my dad's a bit of a character. - I think he's.. - Oh, Grandma Fiona. I would like to welcome our surprise guest, Sydney who has taken a Christmas stopover 'from her worldwide travels' to share this happy holiday with us. - Welcome. - Welcome. Wow. Thank you. 'Welcome.' Actually, it's a Christmas tradition that the guest of honor gives the holiday toast. - 'Tradition.' - 'Yeah.' - Oh, you want me do it? - No. Yeah.. Yeah. No, that's not a thing, is it? 'No, you'll be fine. Ah, it's fine.' Sure, you are. You gave the speech on the airplane, remember? I'm gonna get you for this. Um, okay. Here we go. Good evening, I'm Sydney and on behalf of the entire cooking crew, welcome. Tonight, we'll be dining at an altitude of.. Uh, what is Chicago's.. Six hundred feet? Six hundred? Tonight, we'll be dining at an altitude of six hundred feet. So, please be sure to turn off all portable electronic devices and safely stow it beneath the table until after dinner. Thank you. And, um, may we give thanks 'for this amazing dinner.' And thank you, and all of you, really for inviting me to be a part tonight. So, cheers! - Great. Cheers! - Cheers! - Okay! - Well done! 'Good job.' 'Cheers! Well done.' Johnny's loving.. What? Johnny.. What? Ugh! You guys haven't called me Johnny for years. And all of a sudden.. So, uh, Sydney is super nice. - Oh, I know, right? - Mm-hmm. - Thank you. And, uh.. - Mm-hmm. I mean, beautiful, right? - She's just gorgeous. - Oh. Yeah, of course. I mean.. Leah sure seems to like her a lot. Leah really likes her. - Yeah. - Look.. What? We're just helping each other out. And then, she's leavin' on Christmas. And you know my life is complicated enough already. Well, there is always time for more... More what? Whipped cream? Yes. I agree. You know, I-I don't know why I bother, because you're just gonna do the opposite of everything I tell you anyway. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. - No, I'm not. - You're doing it right now. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. No, I'm not. It may be wrapped in burlap or somethin', but.. - 'Embarrassed right now.' - 'No, I've been careful..' Mm-hmm. Um, apparently, your family is my brain trust. Oh, we are in serious trouble. No, I'm not even kidding. Your dad found something in the photograph that we missed. Show him, Tom. 'Eh, look, uh, closely in the background there, John.' 'Those trees aren't cut.' - 'They're growing.' - Oh, meaning? Well, that's not a Christmas tree lot. It's a Christmas tree farm. 'And there's not a lot of those around.' There used to be one out on, uh, Route 31. - Right by Fox Lake. - I remember that place. Oh, it was lovely. Mm, well, I guess we all better turn in early. Looks like somebody's going on a Christmas road trip tomorrow. 'You better wear something warm.' - Oh. - Linda? I have just the solution. Oh, now, you're just like one of the family. Oh, for me to take? Oh, my gosh! And you better wear it. 'Buonanotte.' Buonanotte. ' "Pizza."' 'Let's see.' Huh! ' "Chicago Stories."' ' "Best pizza place in town."' There we go. Hmm. 'So cute.' 'Classic dad. He marked the route on the map.' - 'Oh, Lord.' - Yup. Are you sure about this place? 'Cause it seems kinda far away from the city. - Call it a reporter's hunch. - Okay. Hey, I read some of your columns online last night. They were really fun. My favorite one was the one where you and Leah are trying to chase down the best cheesesteaks. Oh, yeah. Ah, that column's just sent us off on all these great adventures, I mean.. We looked for the best amusement parks, paintball ranges and, of course, the best pizza. Hm, so is Chicago Pizza really better than any place else in the world? Okay, okay, I'm kidding. - Those are fighting words. - I bet. Yeah. Anyway, your columns were great. Especially the ones with Leah. They're really sweet. You're a good dad. Well, I try. I.. It's not easy, I'm usually out of my depth. Honestly, most of the time, I just feel like a juggler in a three-ring circus. I get it. Well, sorry to complicate things, you know? Oh, no, no. No, I'm not complaining. You're helping me deliver 800 words by Friday. And how many do you have so far? Uh, just one. "Help." - 'Okay. Fox Lake.' - Oh? Yeah, we just have a couple miles up, past the next turn. - A couple miles, you say? - Mm-hmm. Hmm. Oh, wow, this is just like out of a storybook. Hey, Sydney, look at that. That fits within our timeline. Mm-hmm. - Aww. - Oh, man. Look at this little kid. Will be right with you, folks. Just three days to Christmas. Things get awful busy. Feel free to browse. Thank you. Hey! Oh, my goodness. Look at these little guys. My mom used to collect these every winter and we would make little Santa ornaments out of them to hang on the tree. I'd like to see you make a Santa ornament out of these little pinecones. Gosh, I haven't thought about that in so long. Uh-oh. Let's see. ' "No open jump seats."' But my friend at the airlines is gonna keep trying. Excuse me, ma'am. Uh, tree farm is a no-text zone. - Put that away. - Fine. Can I help you folks find a tree? Uh, no. But actually you can help us find something else. Yes, we were wondering if there was ever a guy named Steve Colder who worked here. It's, um, for a newspaper article. I wish I could help you, but lots of kids worked here through the years over Christmas I can't remember 'em all. Well, it's, like, from 30 years ago and he was a college kid. - 'It's this guy.' - 'Hm.' He, uh, would've been a senior that year at Northwestern. - My son went to Northwestern. - Really? I remember that kid. 'Yeah, my son played college hockey with him' and some of the team helped here one Christmas. You sure that's him? I think I'd remember a kid that determined. He had a sprained ankle, but helped anyway. Your dad, huh? I see the resemblance. 'Oh, yeah.' Oh, my goodness! No, really, I.. Nonsense. You're practically family. Well, thank you very much. Listen, laughing boy. Oh, you wanna help me? Sure. Here, I got it. Wow. So my dad worked in a Christmas tree farm. Who knew? I guess that means I have to take back everything that I said about your investigative reporting. Well, apology accepted since you gave me a new paragraph for my column and, oh, a pocketful of these cute little pinecones. And I learned something else about investigative reporting. - Mm? - It's hard work. I'm starving. Oh, well, first, let's pick up Leah 'cause I know just the place. Really? Hmm. 'Well, we deserved the break.' And you're brushing up on your Italian so you can, uh, translate the menu for us. I wasn't gonna let you get away with anything less than deep-dish after your, you know, joke. Clearly. Sydney, if you get that job.. ...how far away is Rome anyway? It's pretty far in miles, but only 11 hours by plane. Anyway, that's, um, it's kind of a long shot. But this pizza is fantastico. Can't believe you've never had this before. Mm, not like this. How's this week compared to your usual Christmas adventures? Mm. Pretty great, actually. Yeah, I just wish I could be more helpful with figuring out more of the story, you know? Oh, no, no. That's on me. Have to be a better reporter. - Okay, so your mom's photo.. - Mm-hmm. What've we got there? I guess I just always thought it was taken at a ballet you know, because she's wearing a leotard and there's like, the nutcracker in the background, and.. What else can you tell me about her? I mean, I don't mean to pry, but.. Got my reporter hat on. Well, she loved music and... to dance. And my grandparents always told me that she also loved to travel. She always wanted to go to the Sydney Opera House. Hence, my name. Hey, maybe your parents' paths crossed at the ballet. Maybe. Although, I really can't imagine my dad as a dancer. 'No?' Maybe I can ask the theater critic down at the paper if he can dig up any programs from some "Nutcracker" performance from that year or.. I don't know. Oh, shoot! Wait, we're late. - For what? - Family emergency. I'm hosting, uh, cookie decorating at my house tonight. That can be your dessert. Our? Oh, no, no, no. There is no way I am crashing more of your Christmas plans. You can just drop me off at the hotel, seriously. I'm not gonna eat those cookies by myself. - Really? Are you sure? - He's sure, and I'm sure. Let's go. The place looks fantastic, Jonathan. Ah, thank you. Ooh. Thanks, mom. It's really good right now, huh? Ooh, nice. Delicious. Looking good. 'Okay, kids, whoever wants to lick the bowls' get in the kitchen, pronto. Whoa! Leah, is there a cookie underneath all those sprinkles? Only way to know is to try it. Leah, you are the Frida Kahlo of frosting and the Van Gogh of vanilla. What does that mean? It means that your cookies are, without question, the very best. 'You look like you're enjoying yourself.' By the way, I left word to the newspaper in case there's any new info on the ballet. I thought you said you don't do a traditional Christmas. - Oh, who knew? - Oh. I guess, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. - Right? - Indeed. Why don't you do some decorating yourself? - What is that, a challenge? - Yes, it is. - Alright. - Have a seat. - Okay. - You a reindeer guy? Or a boot? You're gonna go with the boot? You're trying to copy me? Yeah, well, I figured it's a direct comparison. Oh, no. I have a bad feeling about this. - Me too. - Is your dad good at this? Oh, oh. Yeah, I could use all the help I can get. - 'Can I borrow some red icing?' - Yes, you may. Right. Here he goes. - 'Got it goin' on.' - 'Alright.' - Oh, what do you think? - I think it looks yummy. - But I need to know for sure. - Who's my judge? You have a sweet girl, that's what you have. 'Take it easy, we have to save some of those' for Christmas morning. - Daddy? - Yeah? Sydney isn't going to be here on Christmas morning. And then, what if someone has a gift for her? You are so sweet and not just because you're covered in icing. 'But you don't have to worry about me, okay?' What do you say we give some presents out tomorrow night? Christmas Eve Eve, right? Start a new tradition. Sounds great. Jonathan, can you help me with the dishes? Yeah, I got this. Sydney, want to make a snowman outside? I might be a little rusty.. ...but, um, it's Christmas time, so what do you say? Let's go. Let's make a snowman ten-feet tall. Oh, or we could make a snow-kid that's, like, about your height. What do you think about that? - Let's go. - Okay. Oh, no! Kids are ready for Christmas film fest. Okay. I just wanna give her a couple more minutes. I haven't seen Leah this happy in a while. Yeah. She and Sydney are having a lot of fun. I think you have, too. It's the first Christmas in a while I've seen you this happy. Yeah, I've been having a pretty great week. Look, you're doing an amazing job with Leah. You always put her first. But maybe, it's time you thought about yourself again, too. Seize the day. My day is seized in-between the... bake sales and the brownies and the birthday parties. I don't have room for more. When was the last time you went on a date? Last Christmas? Look, I appreciate the sisterly advice, but... But you don't want it. Exactly. No, don't throw. Stop it. I haven't done this since.. Wow! Since I was probably about your age. Like, ten years ago. Yes! Exactly that. No, I think it was a little longer than that. - Sydney? - 'Yeah?' Are sky angels like snow angels? Hm.. That's a really good question. All I know is that they're both really beautiful whether they're in the snow or up in the clouds. And I'm an expert in the clouds because I've spent almost half my life up there. 'Hey, Leah, the cousins are starting' the Christmas movies, hon. Ooh, I hope they remembered the caramel popcorn. Aw.. Thank you. Oh! Wait! What are you doing to my angels? Looks like you guys are having some fun. Yes, I, uh, couldn't have asked for better Christmas chaperones for this week. Hey, I heard from my editor. Um, your folks didn't show up in any of the "Nutcracker" programs. That was a long shot. And they're not in the archives either so back to square one. That's okay. I just made a snow angel so that is giving me a pretty big sense of accomplishment right now. Johnny, the kids want me to watch movies with them. Uh, you two mind finishing up the dishes? Sure, yeah. We're on it. 'Yeah, nice work today.' You getting into that holiday spirit, I see. I am, I'm.. ...actually having a great time. Yeah, those snow angels looked sharp. You know... I was impressed, I was impressed. I was.. We were all impressed. It's funny, you know, like, Christmases bring back so many happy memories for me. Some bittersweet, as well. - I know what you mean. - Yeah. Well, I gotta say, this past week Leah's been so happy, you know? And I don't think that the caroling and the cookies are just fun, I think that they're also giving her this sense stability and normalcy that she really has been needing. - I understand. - And if I'm being honest, I.. I don't think I'm being such a great dad all the time. I'm always on a call or a deadline and trying to be this ace columnist and this perfect dad and I'm probably just floundering at both. That is so not true. Are you kidding? - Just look at the evidence. - The evidence? What a great kid you have. You know what? - I have to thank you. - For what? For inviting me to be a part of all this. And I have a confession to make. But dinner around a table definitely beats room service. I guess I just forgot, like, how much fun Christmas can be. - Careful. Sorry. - I'm sorry. - I'm just gonna... - 'Oh.' - Oh. Okay. - Actually.. - 'Whoops.' - Oh. Here, did you.. Here, I'll wash. You dry. - Okay. - 'Sure.' 'Hey, Jonathan, Sydney, come here, we've got something.' - Oh. - Okay - Let's go check. Give me that. - No. No? Come on. Hey! Okay, so tech wizard that I am, I managed to scan in the photos at a higher resolution. Now, take a look, that's not a ballet outfit she's wearing. 'It could be an ice-skating outfit.' 'Wait, at a "Nutcracker" performance?' Oh, no, no, no. Take a look at the background here. You see that "Nutcracker" figure is the same one 'they have at the Christmas display' 'every year at City Park.' 'I know exactly where that is.' - 'It's just by the ice rink.' - Mm-hmm. Well, of course, I mean, it makes really good sense. - She loved skating. - We're getting warmer here. Thank you. We're gonna go check it out tomorrow, right? 'Thanks. Yeah, definitely.' 'I'm gonna head back to the hotel for now.' 'But, thank you, Leah.' I had so much fun playing with you today. Thank you so much, sweet girl. I hope you don't mind but I've been praying for bad weather. Why? To keep you here longer, of course. Come here, you. Thank you. I'm gonna see you tomorrow though, okay? - You'll walk me out? - Sure. Okay. Come on. 'Lesson 10.' Kerry, hi. Where are you? Tulsa. Just landed. But the better question is, where are you? - Still in Chicago? - Merrily marooned. 'So, are you still flying out on Christmas day?' As far I know.. ...three more days to feast on Christmas cookies. Unless, of course, my flights get cancelled. So, how are things going? I'm having a surprisingly good time being stranded in Chicago. Doing what, exactly? 'Well, today..' '...we made Christmas cookies.' - 'And I made a snow angel.' - You made a snow angel? You should try it sometime. It's actually quite fun. Just tell me this, in this little Chicago Christmas scenario 'is there a guy involved, perhaps?' 'No, there is not.' I mean, there's a guy, but it's not like that. His name is Jonathan. Mostly, I've just been hanging out with his family for, like, the last three days. Aah! I knew it! You're, you're falling for him, too. - I can hear it in your voice. - No, I am not. I'm not falling for anybody. I'm not even looking to fall, and neither is he. How's the weather in Tulsa? Apparently, not as warm as in Chicago. 'Listen, I am, I'm gonna be landing' 'in O'Hara late tomorrow night.' On my way home for Christmas, do you wanna maybe grab a Christmas mocha? - Yeah, that sounds perfect. - Okay, I'll give you a shout. - Okay. Ciao, ciao. - 'Bye.' Mm. Green one. Our next stop on our Christmas quest.. ...is a Christmas tree farm.. ...where along the pines, we discovered.. Got you covered, dad. ...another bread crumb in our search. Wow, look at this. Your family comes through again. There's our Nutcrackers. - 'There's our ice rink.' - 'Yeah.' So, whoever took my mom's photograph must've been standing up on that gazebo, right? We don't know the whole story, but I'm pretty sure your mom 'skated on that rink.' I guess, skating ran in the family 'cause my grandma always made me take skating lessons growing up. They sure look like they're having fun. Oh, do they? I mean, we are here at an ice rink, right? It would be a shame for us not to give it a try. Oh, I don't think that's a good idea. Come on, daddy. What's the matter, you afraid of a little Christmas adventure? Well, I don't think "afraid" is a strong enough word. I think we should do it. Yeah? Let's go. You're in. Come on! - Come on! - Wow. What are you, a professional skater? - It's coming back to me. - 'Slowly?' Yeah! Yeah! Literally, literally skating circles around me. 'Not really.' Look at you, monkey, you're doing great. Aunty Robin thinks I might even be ready for hockey soon. Oh, thanks a lot, Aunty Robin. Looks like skating runs in your family. Well, you know, one of my very first memories was my mom taking me to the ice rink. She'd put me in between her legs and spin me around. You know, we always used to have so much fun. Ah, that's great material. I'd take notes, but I'm afraid I'd face plant. - Can we take a selfie? - Yeah, you wanna take a selfie? Just be careful of the other skaters. Come over here. Assuming I can stop. Here, careful, careful, careful. Are you ready? - Here we go. - I was taunting. - Got it. - Yeah! - Good job, dad. - Good job, dad. Okay, check this out. Whoo! Oh, now you're rubbing it in. Aww. You know what? The sun's about to set. You wanna go up and check out the view from the gazebo? Oh, get out of these skates? Yes, please. Hm.. Wow. Yeah, look at that. The view is just like from the photograph. 'Yeah.' 'Do you think my dad could've been' the one to stand here and take that photo of my mom? From this angle, well, I think you might be right. Daddy, listen. - Dance? - My pleasure. 'Um, nice.' Okay, Sydney. Now your turn. - Aww. I'm good, sweetie. - Dance, you guys! Hey, monkey. Alright. Ha-hah. She's having fun. You know, it's funny. These past several days have sort of felt like.. ...finding an unopened Christmas present in the closet and getting to take a peek inside. When other kids at school would talk about their parents.. ...it would always make me wonder about my own. I mean, even though my grandparents would would talk about my folks all the time I, I guess.. ...I always felt sort of like a puzzle with a missing piece. Well, I wish my reporting skills were better. We haven't figured out how they actually met yet. No. Even if we only know a part of their Christmas story I feel like there's a silver lining. What do you mean? I only have a couple of photographs of my parents and my memories, but I never imagined that I would able to actually stand in their footsteps and feel so close to them at Christmas. - And do you? - Yeah, I do. And all while having a blast at the same time. Whoa, you should see this town at New Year's. Well, stranger things have happened. I mean, I never even expected to be here for this long. It's interesting to think about how many happy memories this gazebo has probably seen. You never know when a new one might happen. Yeah. Oh! It wasn't quite the memory I was thinking of. Me either. Ah! Oh! It's on! Snowball fight! Leah! Let's flank your dad. I don't know what that means, but let's do it! It means that you get him from your side and I'll get him from mine. Oh, I'm so scared. Here I come. Here I come. 'Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas.' - Hi, how are you? - Good. - Can I get one coffee please? - Sure. Thank you so much. Keep the change. Hello, sir. You look like you could use a little warming up. Oh, thank you, ma'am. This'll sure hit the spot. You certainly have the Christmas spirit. Yes, I do. Hi, may I help you? Hi. Yes, um.. There's a little guardian angel necklace on the window.. That's our display, but.. ...I have one right here. 'Yeah, it's perfect.' I know someone who would love that for Christmas. And I have a nice box that'll go in. Great. And, uh, I just need one other gift. You looking for anything special? I'm not really great at picking out Christmas presents. Uh, well, over here, we have a lovely, uh vintage mahogany washboard. 'It's very popular.' Yeah, I'm no Mrs. Claus but I'm pretty sure it's not his style. You know what I mean? 'Oh, I like the typewriters, though, those are nice.' I don't know. Maybe that'll just remind him too much of work. How about I let you, uh, browse around on your own? Some people just shop better solo. Okay, thank you. Hmm. Sydney, look at my pinecone Santa I made. He's perfect. Yeah, they did turn out pretty well, didn't they? Here's another one ready for the tree. So glad you remembered. I know, I guess it's sort of like riding a bike or playing the piano, huh? Though, I did refresh my memory by watching a couple of online craft videos. - They look great. - 'Yeah, they do.' Next step, perching them on the tree. Shall we? Come on. Great. - What do you think? - Perfect. Daddy, come see the ornaments we made. There's too many great choices. I can only pick three photos for my column. Wow, I guess that's gonna be between you and your editor. How's the word count going? Well, somehow, my writer's block melted away. Just gotta figure out how this ends. And when is it gonna be published? Well, if my editor signs off, tomorrow night, Christmas Eve. Wow. Is there anywhere in the world that you haven't been? Of course, plenty of places. I do like to take a couple of shots of every new place I go. Wow, those are terrific. 'That's Machu Picchu.' 'One of the most amazing places ever.' And that's the Great Wall of China. - The pyramids, of course. - Of course. And Mount Fuji of Japan. Alright, this is embarrassing. I've barely been anywhere. You've seen so much of the world. Aw. Don't sell yourself short. Chicago is like.. It's a whole world in itself. Mm-hmm? And, besides, I mean.. ...look at what you have. You have such a great life. And a truly... ...wonderful family. Nah. Nope. I mean, we're pretty crazy, look but pretty terrific. Hey, you two, we're opening some early Christmas gifts. Come join us. 'Oops. Kerry's texting me.' She wants me to call her. She's gonna be passing through O'Hare. Oh, yeah? Well, if she is in town, tell her to come by. The more the merrier. - Yeah? - Yeah. Thanks. 'Jonathan, Sydney, come here, we've got something.' We're coming! You know what? I'll just call her after the presents. 'Come sit, Sydney.' Our guest of honor goes first. I cannot believe that you guys got me anything. You've already been so very generous. Nonsense, you're like family to us. And since you won't be here at Christmas time we'll each open a present early. Tsk. Okay. Thank you. Ooh! Let's see what I got. Luggage tags. Perfect. We all wanted to make sure that you knew where to find us. I love them and I will treasure them always. Thank you. Leah, this one's for you. An angel! Oh.. 'I saw it and thought of you the very first moment' 'that I did.' So, now, you can have an angel right next to your heart. Thank you, Sydney. I love it. I'm so glad, sweet girl. And this one is, technically, for both of you. Oh. - Hmm. - Hm. A box! 'Open it.' 'Whoa.' Oh, look! Got it? Like your ringtone. Oh, yeah. Hey, that's perfect. Thanks. Side joke, huh? You get the inside joke. And, Sydney, dad and I have one more gift... for you. - You do? - 'Yes.' Aw. What in the world can it.. Wow. 'Guys.' 'That is so beautiful.' So you'll remember us wherever you are. Come here. Thank you. I love it. Oh, I love it, I love it. Ugh! It's Kerry calling me again. I'm so sorry. - Oh, no, that's fine. - Will you please excuse me? - I have to take this. - 'Yeah, yeah. Go on.' She's been calling all day. We'll open some more presents.. - Ker? - Ugh, Sydney! I've been calling you for hours. I know. I'm sorry, I just got caught up in a little bit of holiday fun. Well, I'm just relieved I've got you now. How are you? Where are you? How are your travel plans shaping up? Never mind my travel plans. Let's talk about yours. What do you mean? My friend in HR said you got it. - What? I got what? - You got Rome. I did? Wait.. 'I got Rome? I-I can't even believe that.' 'Well, you better start to believe it.' 'Check your email.' Oh.. Wow! Rome! 'I-I don't even know what to say.' Well, what's to say? It's everything you ever wanted. 'Hello?' Yeah. No, I'm here, um.. Are you saying you're not gonna grab it? No, I-I-I guess, I just.. I have to think about it, you know? Okay. You work for ten years for this and then you get it 'and then you want more time?' 'You learned Italian for this, Syd.' No. I know. I think, it's just, um.. It's just such a surprise, you know? Okay, listen, I land in Chicago late tonight. Let's meet up in the hotel lobby tomorrow and chat before you catch your flight, okay? Um.. Hey, I gotta go. I'm gonna call you back later though, okay? - I promise. - 'Okay, you better.' Hi. Hi. So, uh, you got Rome? Sorry. I overheard your conversation. That's okay. Um, it's not definite yet but, um, they need someone to fill in pretty fast and they said that I'm basically a shoo-in for the job if I can just get there by Christmas. - That's great. - Yes. Well, congratulations. I-I know you really wanted it. Thank you. It's just, uh.. I guess, getting the news right now feels, like, a little overwhelming. So, you're off then? I have to leave tomorrow. 'Daddy, Sydney, are you coming back in here?' I, um.. I should probably get back to my hotel. Alright. Okay. Thank you for everything. Whoa! Where's the fire? I just can't believe Christmas Eve is tonight. Yes, it is. Oh, we have to hang some stockings soon. We are going to see Sydney again, aren't we? Tsk. I hope so. But we have Christmas to prepare for. I thought she wasn't leaving until Christmas day. She doesn't like us anymore? Oh, no, no. It's not like that. So, why did she leave early? Sometimes someone comes into your life and they can't stay for long but it doesn't mean that they don't have an impact. What's an impact? It means we're gonna remember her. - I'm going to miss her. - I know. Will she be okay? I think so. Why? She's traveling all by herself. Come here. No, Lorenzo, I don't really feel like going to the market. No, I'm not avoiding things. Ugh! "Unaccompanied grown-up." Hello. 'We have visitors down at reception.' I do? Okay, I'll be right down. 'Sydney!' Hi. Leah reminded me that you're still in our care for a few more hours, so I wanted to make sure our unaccompanied grownup was packed and ready for her trip. Almost. My flight's in a few hours. How's your column going? - All done. - That's great. Thank you, Sydney, for everything. Uh.. It was the best Christmas gift of all that you were assigned.. ...to look after Leah. What time's your flight? It's at, um, 07:00 pm. 'So, if you look up in the sky around 7:15' and you see a plane overhead just know that I'll be waving down at you, okay? So, you're flying Christmas Eve? Tsk. Yes, I am. But, um, I think I'm in pretty good company because, if I remember correctly uh, somebody else flies on Christmas Eve. - It's, um... - Santa. - Oh, yeah. - Santa. Yeah. And if I see him I'm going to put in a very good word for you. I, um.. Sorry, I'm not really good at saying goodbye. 'Then let's say in Italian.' Arrivederci. Come here. Arrivederci, beautiful. - Hey, you okay? - Huh? Oh, yeah. I'm fine. Sure about that? Well, if I told you the truth, you'd just say, "I told you so." No, I-I won't, I promise. Let me guess. It's about Sydney? Come on. I'll buy you an eggnog. Thanks for not telling, "I told you so." I don't care about being right. - I just want you to be happy. - I know. She's really leaving, huh? Yeah. She got offered her dream job in Rome. Uh-huh. And she took it? Yeah. Did you tell her how you felt? Let's say, I do tell her how I feel and let's say... she feels the same way I-I don't know if Leah is ready. Leah or you? Maybe you're the one who is up in the air. But to be happy, you have to be ready to finally move on in life. Are you? Oh, maybe this is Sydney. It's my editor. Hey there. Oh. Thank you. Thanks. Merry Christmas. News? - She loved the column. - Oh, great. Yeah. Can you watch Leah this afternoon? Sure. Why? Well, the column's done, but I promised Sydney that I'd find out how her parents met and I haven't done that yet. Okay. Sounds good. Leah, come on, let's go. Sydney, there you are. Kerry. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Hmm. I got in at midnight, I slept like a log. What do you say we grab some peppermint mochas and then head to the airport? Sure. I could use a sympathetic ear. You got it. 'Okay, skaters, ten more minutes of free skating' 'till we clear the ice for hockey practice.' "Hockey." Excuse me? Hey, did they say hockey's gonna take the ice? Just for a couple of hours. Christmas Pairs Competition is tonight. Oh. How long have they been doing that competition? For as long as I can remember. Hey, it's Jonathan in Features. Can I talk to Jeremy in Archives? Thanks. Hey, Jeremy. We need to look through archives again. It's a long shot, but I got a hunch. Look, I know it's Christmas Eve. I know you've had a whirlwind week but Rome will be a whole new chapter for you, right? Yes. I hope so. I mean, and one thing you never have to think about ever again is jetlag every time you want to see somewhere new in Europe or Africa 'cause you'll just be one or two time zones away. That's why I love you. You always know how to cheer me up. It's my pleasure. And, you know, I get it. Jonathan sounds like a really great guy. He is. Oh, speaking of.. I think his article might be out by now. Ooh. 'So exciting.' "A Christmas Story." 'Oh, your cab's here.' Oh. - Send it to me, okay? - I will. - Oh. - Oh. I'm excited for you. - Promise you'll come see me? - Of course! - Soon? - That's a given. You better. For most folks, the days up till Christmas are about searching for trees, treats and gifts. But for one hometown girl, it was a different kind of search for a Christmas story of her own. A search to discover how her parents Steve and Josephine met, one Chicago Christmas a long time ago. Now, while we may never know the story of how Steven and Josephine met they will always be a part of Sydney's Christmas story and the memories we found along the way. Our Christmas memories are like lights on a tree each one that lights up, illuminates a moment of happiness past and happiness future. And these are the lights that guide us home. Jonathan? Sydney. You're supposed to be at 35,000 feet up there. Yeah. But, I'm here. Why are you here? I came to take a peek at the pair skating. They're having it tonight. Jonathan, I read your column. I loved it. Especially, the ending. May I? Sure. "Our search ended atop a gazebo "where countless others have stood. '"Gazing out at the city' "twinkling with a million memories and moments and maybe that's a gift in itself." Thank you. I had to come back here and see.. ...the gazebo one last time. The thing is, I've been to so many amazing places and I guess I never expected to feel such a special connection with just one.. ...place. 'And I do.' This is home. Um, Sydney, can I tell you something? Um, the thing about reporters is we never give up and I did some digging and I found something. - Found what? - It's a Christmas gift for you. A story, actually. 'Hockey's winding up shortly.' 'So, pairs, ten minutes and the ice is yours.' About a young woman who loves to skate. And she, uh, would practice right here at this very rink. But one year, when she came to rehearse for the Christmas Pairs Competition her partner cancelled. She was so disappointed because.. ...after all, dancing was her passion on the ice and off. Come on. But a hockey player saw her on that gazebo. He worked at a Christmas tree farm. And he was exhausted at the end of the day but he saw how much it meant to her so he volunteered to be her skating partner. Now, he wasn't much of a dancer.. ...but he knew the ice. And with her help, after a couple of weeks they skated circles around the competition. E-even a sprained ankle didn't stop him from winning the competition.. ...and from falling in love. But how do you know all of this? It's all in this article, my associate and I 'dug up from the archives.' I was gonna mail it to Rome. 'It ran as a human-interest story in the paper' 'with a little background of how your folks met.' First names only, and that's why it didn't show up earlier. 'Josephine and Steve.' Wow. Mom and dad. Jonathan, this is the best Christmas present that you could ever give me. Well, I'm glad you like it. - But I'm sorry. - For what? Well, now, I've made you miss two flights. This is one plane I am so not sorry to miss. And, you know, Chicago is a hub.. ...and.. ...a great home base for adventures. Are you sure? Nobody's ever confused Chicago with Rome. No, they haven't. But, um, you may not know this but the pizza's top-notch here. That's true. And... if it's Chicago then... it'll be like coming home. Would you like to hang out with Lean and I this evening? Drink eggnog, and sing some carols. Unless you've got other Christmas plans. Nothing would make me happier.
