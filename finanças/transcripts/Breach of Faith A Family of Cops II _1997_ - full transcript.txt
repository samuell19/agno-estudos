[music playing] [engine roaring] White Mustang on the runway not cleared for takeoff. [siren blaring] METEOROLOGIST (ON RADIO): The forecast, plenty of sunshine throughout today with seasonal temperatures. We should reach our normal high of about 82 degrees by this afternoon. Clear skies tonight, low near 70. Increasing cloudiness tomorrow. Sticky-- EDDIE (ON POLICE RADIO): That joker's got that thing wound up to 100, but so do we. We're gaining on him. Eddie, be careful. EDDIE (ON POLICE RADIO): Haven't had breakfast yet, but it looks like it's going to be a fine day in the neighborhood. Step out of the car! Hands up, Gonzalez. Andale! Ah, no. [speaking japanese] Andale? Philo, he's Japanese I don't speak Japanese. Hands up! [speaking japanese] Came all the way from Japan just to buy the car. He said his whole life he wanted a Shelby Mustang. 350 horses, original leather. $42,000. Now, how can we allow national treasures like this just to leave the country? Sayonara. Roger. Arigato and out. Smart ass. DISPATCHER (ON POLICE RADIO): Car 931, proceed to Saint Paul's Damascus Church-- Ma'am. Was it you who called? Please follow me. [crying] Bless this sick world. [whistling] Oh, good morning. I heard the baby crying. You know, she's too old to sleep in a crib. And he shouldn't be on formula unless it's Soya. You look like Herman Munster. So, Benola, what do you take in your coffee? - Cream and sugar. - Ah. [baby crying] Like you said, less than a minute. Hey, you know, I know something else that takes less than a minute. [laughing] Hey, how long is the family adviser going to be here? Aunt Shelly? Always anti everything. Whatever we do is wrong. I'm gonna talk to Pop about it. His sister comes to visit, and all of a sudden she becomes our problem. Between her whining and your nagging, I don't know what to do. [phone rings] Hello. Yeah, hang on. It's Tom Cruise. Hi. I love that vampire thing you did. You really made me believe. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I love you, baby. OK, Tom, he's gone. You can come over. Tom? Mel, it's me, Jackie. My sister didn't come home last night, so-- MELANIE (ON PHONE): So? So? So maybe she's out there somewhere in echo cyber-noir. Maybe she had a date or something last night. So maybe she's buried in some trash bin and-- and got raped or something. I think that she's somewhere a little more luxurious than a trash bin. I'll tell you what, If she's not home by Friday, we'll send out the Saint Bernards. Bye. Wait-- Hello? [grumbles] [chatter] Excuse me. Inspector. Hi, Pop. There were 19 people here for the 6:30 sunrise mass. Mostly working people. They come in early before first shift. When Father Mick-- Mick Mikleshevski? It's kind of hard to rhyme with anything, huh? Yeah. When the priest didn't show, the parishioners got worried. And two of them saw blood coming from the confessional. When did we get here? Uh, mobile squad logged in first, patrolmen Burton and Fein. Eddie and his partner were in at 6:46. They called Sergeant Avez, he called Detective HQ. It's been about an hour since the body was discovered. There's no senior CI yet. Excuse me. He was shot from two different directions. We have shell casings from two different guns. We're checking to see if any anything's been stolen. Nah, this was no robbery. [organ music] Would you like somebody to take you home, Mrs., uh-- Do you speak English? Yes, I speak perfect English. My husband and I have been here many years. We support this old church. We did it because we loved Father Mikleshevski. He was a saint. He was always doing good. And someone kills him while he waits to hear confession. Why? Why would someone do that? How could such a person-- We're expecting our spring collection on Friday. Where have you been? Breakfast at Tiffany's. I mean it, Kate. Why didn't you tell me that you were going to be out playing all night? I was not playing. I worked late. Fell asleep at the office. Sorry I didn't call. Um, what are you doing to my wardrobe? I have a job interview. I need an outfit. Are we looking for anything in particular? Yeah. Conservative, but hip. Uh-huh. Anti-progressive, but up-to-date-ish. Uh, yeah. Likely to appeal to Rush Limbaugh and Howard Stern. Why bother? Whatever the job, you're going to turn it down. You're making a career out of interviewing, Jackie. It pays less than zero. Maybe urban toil isn't for me. I've come to believe in nature's essence. Life is like the sun. It rises and it sets. And I am a river. Isn't that zen? I'm interviewing for secretary of the hockey team. Could be fun. Hockey players are bonzer. That's Australian for knock up bang up jack up slap up all wool and a yard wide. I practiced typing on your computer and it froze up or something. But that internet, that's fun. I ordered us 6 pounds of hash from some guy in Istanbul. And the pornography. The things they do in cyberspace. This is nice. I'm going to take a shower, and then I'm going to wear this blouse. So keep looking. Uh! You're Catholic, aren't you? Well, kind of. What am I saying. Yes. I'm Catholic. I love the religion, I just don't seem to be agreeing with some of the things the church is saying lately. I'm not sure what I believe. [speaking russian] Well, we need translators here. A lot of these people, they don't speak English. I'll get right on it. Oh, Inspector. I asked some of the people here about the altar boy. Where is he? That's just it. Father Mikleshevski always has a boy help him. But there was no boy here this morning. You ever waitress before? Sure. Um, yeah. Lots of places. Mm-hmm. Where would those places have been? Uh, mostly California. You-- you probably wouldn't know the restaurants. You got references? References? I have, um, no references. No references. Well, you gotta start somewhere, huh? What are you doing here? I told you yesterday I don't want this stuff on the tables. Don't you listen?! You can start tomorrow. - Tomorrow. Tomorrow. That soon? Yeah, it's tomorrow. You know, never mind. It's OK. Ah! [vases shattering] Hey, where you going? [gate buzzing] Hi. Hi. The Michelin Guide to prisons, I'd give this 1 and 1/4 stars. It's my duty to remind you the kind of animal you're considering releasing back into the community. He went out at night with his friends and assaulted old people. They reveled in their viciousness. And he was the one who videoed all the action so that they could enjoy their brutality over and over. Make no mistake, he is violent and dangerous. What were the charges again? Accomplice to murder, battery with a deadly weapon. He didn't commit the murder or the battery. No, he just videotaped his buddies as they bashed in an old man's head with a baseball bat. He didn't swing the bat. Maybe he fouled off his pitch. A man died because this scum-- Scum? That's enough. We're not here to retry this case. This parole officer is apparently vehemently opposed. But you think we should allow this release tomorrow, why? Because this scum, my client, is only 12 years old. Mrs. Sanduski. I'm Inspector Fein. You called us? Please don't be nervous. I called because I take care of the rectory. I've been taking care of it for a long time now. I've been here almost as long as Father Mick. Are you scared of someone? Yes, I'm scared. There's a man. His name is Volodia Pietrov. Do you think he killed the Father? No, I don't know. But he was here last week, and he was yelling at Father Mick. I could hear him yelling from the rectory next door. He kept saying things like, "You have to leave. Leave or you're going to die." I was worried and I told Father Mick. He said not to worry. I wanted to call the police. I didn't. [crying] I should have told them about Volodia Ben get home? He's in bed, worn out. Let him sleep. Tell him to call me first thing in the morning. I come all this way from Boca Raton to spend some time with my brother, and you have no time? Goodbye. I was in the old neighborhood today, Shelly. So I heard. That priest that was killed on Tatonia Avenue. You have any leads? I might have something. There's something to do with the Russians, the Russian mafia that's been building up. Well, as a psychologist, I can tell you that anyone who would kill a priest would have serious difficulty in a debate between God and the Devil. Who's in this Russian mafia? Who isn't? Russians, Chechens, Armenians-- And Jews. How does that make you feel? - How do you think I feel? - I don't know. That's why I ask. Daddy spent a lot of money so I would learn to ask educated questions like that. All this hate, it feels so old. Good. What's good? You see violence and death every day, and yet you still think of hate as old. That's what Daddy would have wanted for us, to think of hate as old and unnatural. Where he came from, it wasn't. Daddy would be a very happy boychik. [phone rings] Yeah. [muffled male voice] [phone clicks] Who was it? I don't know. Someone speaking Russian. He asked if I was Inspector Fein. Then he said the Feins, then he named the family, like Jackie, Eddie, Kate, and Ben. Then he hung up. [door clicks] The altar boy that was supposed to be in attendance the morning of the murder? - Yeah? It was a kid named Andrew Baskin. We're trying to find him, but his parents say they don't know where he is. Do you need me? You mind if I borrow your partner? Nope. He was yours before he was mine. Let's go. Where to? See if we can trace this Volodia character. Good afternoon. I'm Yannis Ivanov. We were just talking to your wife about-- As you should. In this house, she's the boss, and me, I'm the idiot. You're here about Father Mick's murder, yes? A crime against God. Oh, my driver is here. I am late for an appointment. Goodbye, my dear. I'm sorry, I must go. I have one more question. Do you know Volodia Pietrov? Volodia. I know his father. I know where his shop is. TONI: Volodia not live here. Where does he live? I don't know. But Volodia not kill priest. I never said that he did. I just want to talk to him. Do you know where he is? Mr. Pietrov, do you believe in your son? If you believe in him, then you should help me find him. How about his friends? Do you know any of his friends? His friends. If Volodia have problem, it's always their problem. They are not working peoples. What do you mean? Black market. Mostly are yevrey. Yevrey? Yevrey, Jews. Do you know their names? Boris and Elia. I'll show you where they hang out. [children playing] [chatter in russian] [speaking russian] My brother's grunge. He hangs out with these spuds. He's always getting his tail in the mix. I've got a sister that sounds a lot like you. Is that good? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, sure. There. There what? VOLODIA'S SISTER: That's them. That's, uh, Boris and-- VOLODIA'S SISTER: Elia, yeah. Elia. Those are your brother's friends, right? Yeah. OK. You stay put. Pop, on your left. [chatter in russian] Let's go. [speaking russian] [frantic music] Police. [gunshot] Nobody move. Nobody! [chatter in russian] Hi. Oh, hi. Benny. Hey. What are you doing here? Why are you dressed like a Republican? Looking for a job. Got anything I can do? Anybody I can beat up? Well, we are about to do some serious interrogating. You picked a bad time to visit, Jack. We got a priest killer to catch. Where's Daddy? He's waiting for us. We gotta move. See you. ANNA: See you. Yep. No drugs, no drinking. No leaving the state without my permission. No associating with other parolees. Carry a gun? You go back to prison. No guns, no knives, no weapons of any kind. Can he eat with a fork? I catch you even holding a fork, and you're not in a house or a restaurant at the time, you go back to prison. You'll report to this office once a week every Tuesday between 8:00 and 5:00. And I'll be visiting you at your home whenever I feel like it. Is that all understood? Ronnie? Did you understand what your parole officer just said? I understand. I can't do nothing. What you can do is sign this parole agreement. So right there. Ronnie. You want to stay out of prison, don't you? Yeah, but I don't care if I have to come back either. What's this? It's a tattoo of what? RONNIE: Yeah. What is it, a peace symbol? And a machine gun. It means peace if you want it, screw you if you don't. [laughs] [gate buzzing] A little animal that'll grow up to be a big one. That boy-- It's a 12-year-old kid with a bad case of acne. Listen, I know what he did, and I know he deserves punishment. I know you would like to keep him in prison for 10 years. But then we're going to have to get him released. In 10 years, he's going to have a master's degree in crime and hate. 10 years of learning with the best. 10 years to become a hardened criminal filled with anger for society. What do you think he's going to do then when he gets out? Lady, I'm just worried about what he'll do tonight. Zen girl. Huh? Oh. [inaudible] I've been on eight job interview in two days, and I can't seem to find anything suitable for my talents, whatever they may be. So I've decided to take a moratonium. That's moratorium. I've also decided to let you take me out to lunch. Can't Ugh, everybody's busy. Everybody's working. Freud said it takes both love and work to be totally mature. Something like that-- Ronnie Grissom? You represent that total creep who videotaped his friends bashing people? The guy's totally natural born killers. How much time did he get? About a year. He's out now. Out? How did he get out? I talked to his parole board. Why? Look at me when I'm talking to you. You're in more trouble than you think, Igor. You might have helped a priest killer escape. An alleged, possible, maybe they did it killers. And when we get them, and if they did kill that priest, I'm kicking your ass right to jail. That's the way it's going to be! You do not pass go, you do not collect $200. Do you understand that? You're going to get life, plus 30, plus another 30 for hitting me because you piss me off! Translate that exactly. [speaking russian] They're tough guys. They've probably been in every prison from Moscow to Vladivostok. Most likely been half beaten to death and fed dead rats for breakfast. We're not going to get anything out of them by yelling at them. And being a criminal wasn't the worst thing in the world over there. You sound almost sympathetic. Just hard to figure Jewish guys killing a priest, that's all. Look, why don't you come home with me? At least I made some food. It's 2:00 AM, and I know what you're going to do. You're going to go get a pizza, right? That's exactly what I'm going to. You go home, Ben. All right, Pop, I'll see you in the morning. Hey. Hey. Look, um, since you're spending so much time with my partner, I think the least you could do is get me another one. See you. - Goodnight, Inspector. - Goodnight, Anne. [glass shattering] Garver Street? Let's go. [suspenseful music] [gunshot] [gunshots] [gunshot] [gunshot] Philo! Philo! 961, officer down. Officer down. Come out with your hands up! Now! Move! [gunshots] [siren blaring] My god, he's just a kid. [ominous music] We could kill you now. Next time for sure, unless you look in other place for who killed priest. No more warning. [speaking russian] Inspector Fein. I thought it was a pretty good funeral. All I did was believe that children should not be put in prison. A cop is dead. Even that little kid, that 12-year-old boy, would still be alive if I hadn't fought to have him released. It's not your fault. Of course it is! OK, so it is. And tomorrow another kid's going to shoot somebody, and it'll be somebody else's fault. I just-- I just don't know what's right or wrong. That's a pretty big admission from a lawyer. Katie, you lawyers may not make mistakes, but we cops, we make them all the time. Do you ever get over them? No. They just become part of you. I'll get you something to drink. What are you looking at? What am I supposed to say, Eddie? What am I supposed to do? Nothing, Katie, nothing. I'm not-- I'm not angry at you, I'm not. What about Philo's family? They can understand. They don't-- How can they understand? Their son is dead! They don't blame you, Katie. I don't blame you. Eddie, it could have been you who got shot. No. No. No, I-- You could have been dead-- You don't have to say anything, Kate. You don't have to apologize for anything, I love you. I love you. Come on. Come on. After cheese you don't drink orange juice. And you haven't finished your chicken. I hate chicken! A chicken is to a Jew what a buffalo is to an Indian. Listen to your Aunt Shelly, Maya. Maybe she'll leave you her full-length chicken coat that she dies. Oh-ho-ho-ho. I gotta go. See you, sweetheart. Hey. I want to ask you guys a question. Sure. A little louder, please. OK, maybe this isn't the best time. Jackie, it's the only time. We've got a killer to catch. What is it? OK, I'm just going to throw it out. I'm just going to pitch it to you. Jackie, pitch the ball already. The umpire's about ready to call the game. What is it? I'm joining the police academy. OK, so you guys don't believe me. But you know how hard I've been looking for a job, and I've really been trying, but I just can't seem to find a gig that I like. Anyway, I really want to do this. So I talked to that commissioner friend of yours-- Stop it now. What the hell's the matter with you? We just buried a policeman this morning. I know, but I need to tell you this now because I talked to Commissioner Davis and-- and classes start next week. And I need to pass the exam, and that starts tomorrow. Forget it. Daddy. I want to do this. You don't know what you want. You've never known what the hell you wanted. Pop, please. Thanks. Jackie, you realize that if you do become a cop, never again will you spend more than $10 for a meal. You know that, right? Look, we just don't think you're made for this, that's all. Why not? What about me isn't made for it? Is it my hair? I'll dye it police blue. My earrings? They come off. What is it, my supposed criminal past? They say it's a fine line that separates the two sides of the law. So what is it? It's nothing. I'm going to do this. I won't help you. You already have. I get an extra 10 points on my exam because my dad's a cop. [honking] [cameras clicking] Meet Volodia Pietrov. I don't know how they got him up there without anyone seeing. Anyone did see this happen, they're not going to be too anxious to talk. There's no humor anymore in bad guys. Whatever happened to the happy hoods and guys and dolls? I feel like I'm about to jump out of a plane without a parachute. You'll be fine. Just call if you need anything, huh? Well, geraldo. Geraldo? Isn't that what you say when you're going to jump out of a plane? Geronimo. I know. Hey. Oh. Ben, I'm worried about Dad. He just seems a little sad lately. Well, that thing with Philo getting killed and that priest being murdered, it shook him up a little bit, you know? Right. You know, he told me a story yesterday when we came out of there. He said that when he was a kid, he and his dad used to walk to Grandpa's shop on Sundays to clean the place up. They'd always walk by this Russian immigrant center. He said people used to stand outside and stare at them. Nobody ever said anything, they just stood outside and stared, you know. So I asked him why. And he said it was because we were Jews. So maybe he's thinking about what his dad must have gone through, I don't know. Look, you're gonna learn how to be a cop, and you don't be reckless, because I've only got one baby sister. You hear me? Now, go on. Get out of here. Inspector Fein, I'm-- I know who you are, Miss Woodel. I understand you've been looking for my clients. Mr. Koulichkov and Mr. Sandomirsk have come here voluntarily because recently they've heard they were being sought for questioning regarding the murder of Father Mikleshevski. Take them away, read them their rights, and then shoot them. You have a lousy sense of humor. Surprise, surprise, huh? Guess what? We found the altar boy. He's here with his mother, Mrs. Baskin. Andrew, you were at the church the morning Father Mikleshevski was murdered, weren't you? I was sick. I didn't go. How long have you been an altar boy at Saint Paul Damascus? One year. Did you like Father Mikleshevski? He was old, but you could still talk to him. He was a funny guy. Priest, I mean. Yeah, I-- liked him a lot. Listen, son, nothing will happen to your family if you help us. Is that what you told Volodia? We never talked to Volodia. You know, if he had come to us, we might have helped him. How? These guys, they can kill anybody, they can do anything. And you can't stop them. This is going to take courage, but you have to help us. Andrew, they killed a priest. I know. If you didn't do anything, why did you run in the park? We not know who you are. Maybe sometime do illegal thing. We scared. We not know you think we kill priest. And Volodia killed, we more scared, and call lawyer. What do you know about Volodia's murder? Nothing. Did you ever meet Father Mikleshevski? Never. Ever been to the Saint Paul of Damascus Church? We're Jewish. What we do in church? We've never been to church. Andrew, did you see any of these men at the church the morning that Father Mikleshevski was killed? You don't have to be afraid, you know. Don't worry, Andrew, they can't see you. Andrew, you have to tell us the truth, whatever it is. I didn't see them. Andrew, we can-- Ben. You can go home now. It's all right, Andrew. We're going now. The kid's so scared, he could die of fright in his sleep tonight. Well, we're checking fingerprints with immigration, Interpol, Moscow police, St. Petersburg police, Black Sea police. It would be easier if the Soviet Union were still one country. Well, you've gotta work fast. They've got a bail hearing first thing in the morning. [bell ringing] [panting] Kate, it's me. What do you do for bleeding blisters and athlete's foot? I think even my blisters have athlete's foot. Oh, and one more question. Can women get jock itch? Call me. [ominous music] [phone ringing] MATTHEW (ON PHONE): Kate, it's Matthew Hufflinger, your favorite parole officer. I got your number from someone in your office. Um, I'm sorry I lied a little, I said it was important business. Well, it's kind of important, I guess. I thought maybe you'd need some cheering up. Immigration says these guys arrived on valid visas. No criminal records. And nothing on them at Interpol either. They probably have phony passports. Who knows if they even are who they say they are? [phone rings] Meyers. Thanks. The Russians. They got off on bail half an hour ago. Anne. Ah, never mind. I'd love to have dinner with you some night. [phone rings] Yeah? MAN (ON PHONE): [speaking russian] What is it? Someone just told me in Russian to get over to my son's apartment. [suspenseful music] Eddie! Eddie. Pop. Don't talk, don't talk. ANNE: 25 Tayboch Street, Apartment 3. That's right. Don't move, Eddie, don't move. Relax, little brother. You face looks like a map of Romania. There'll be an ambulance here in a few minutes. You know that song that says Saturday night's the crummiest night of the week? I think Monday's the one you gotta watch out for. I guess they meant what they said. What do you mean? What who said? Well, they threatened me a few nights ago. Why didn't you tell me? Benny, call home. Hey, Mel. It's me. You OK? You sure? If you're OK, you give me a number between 1 and 5. OK, good. All right, listen to me. I want you to lock the doors. I'm sending a squad over there right now. You don't open the door for anybody but a cop, you hear me? Mel, just do it. I'll tell you when I get home. OK? I love you. All right. [suspenseful music] [phone rings] KATE (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): Hi, you've reached Kate Fein. I'm not able to take your call right now, so please leave a message after the tone. Thanks. [gasping] There's no answer at Kate's. [distant screaming] It's nothing. Here, this will help. Thank you. Benny! Benny! He's my friend! I'm, OK, Dad. I'm-- I'm fine. Where's Jackie? She's, um-- she's at the academy. I'll call to make sure. OK. If she's there, tell her to stay. [rock music] PRIEST: You heal the wounds of sin and division. Christ, have mercy. CONGREGATION: Christ, have mercy. PRIEST: For, Jesus, you intercede for us with your father. Lord, have mercy. CONGREGATION: Lord, have mercy. PRIEST: You raise the dead with the life of the Spirit. Lord, have mercy. CONGREGATION: Lord, have mercy. PRIEST: You bring pardon and peace to the sinner. Christ, have mercy. CONGREGATION: Christ, have mercy. For, Jesus, you heal the wounds of sin and division. Christ, have mercy. CONGREGATION: Christ, have mercy. PRIEST: For, Jesus, you intercede for us with your father. Lord, have mercy. CONGREGATION: Lord, have mercy. Here you go. You need this. Thanks. [phone rings] Hello. MAN: Hello. I must speak to Inspector Fein. He there? Hold on. Pop, it's them. - Yeah. - [speaking russian] Inspector. We left message with your two children. Yeah, I got your message, you son of a bitch. We've gotta get these slime balls, and we've gotta do it tonight. Not tonight, but we'll get 'em. [ominous music] It's good that you make it here. It's important that you say Volodia killed the priest. Everyone will believe it. Volodia's dead. He had some bad friends in the park. So you can't say he didn't do it. So you solved your case. [speaking russian] What should I say was the reason he killed the priest? I don't know. Maybe he don't like him. [laughs] You come up with a reason. You want money? Anyway, your family will be safe now. You found man who killed priest. You are hero. [clapping] You can be chief of police. I can't close the case like that. You're still the main suspect, you see. I can't just pull everyone off you. I have to keep some surveillance. My son here will follow you for a few days, OK? Two days. Two days more, then case is closed. Da? [laughter] Victor. Victor! Boris sends you a present to keep you warm. [raucous laughter] I feel like a teenager sitting in a parking lot late at night. Hey, we could kill some time by necking. I'm sorry. You've got so much on your mind. I know what I go through as a detective. Being an inspector must be very difficult. Life was easier when I had a partner. Yes. Ben's made it easy for me. Having a good partner makes a big difference on the job. I was talking about my wife. How'd it go? No problem. They hit like children. [laughter] Hey. [car starting] Huh? Huh? Car? [laughing] [conversation in russian] You speak Russian that good, not even a Russia can tell you're not Russian. I speak worse than Pasternak, but better than Stalin. How did you get the transmitter on him? Inspector. [speaking russian] That's good. All right. All right, that's good. Let me ask you something. What happens if they find it? What are they going to do, sue us? [laughing] This is where the one guy, Elia, thinks they should leave the city. He says he doesn't trust you. He's afraid if they stay, you'll eventually get evidence to convict them of killing the priest. That's an admission, isn't it? They never actually say they killed the priest. No. But let's jump ahead. Now, here's that girl, Marina. They picked her up at a strip club. She looks young. What does she say exactly? Volodia and the priest didn't have to die. It does sound like she knows they killed the priest. Why don't they kill her? Probably because of this. [groaning] She's Boris' girlfriend. But he could still kill her. Why don't we pick her up? Too dangerous. We need to talk to her privately first. [dance music] Two Scotch rocks, one vodka soda. Hi. Hi. Is your name Marina? Yes. You know, I've got two daughters. I couldn't imagine one of daddy's little girls becoming choo-choo comet queens or topless dancers. Lots of daddies come in here. Vodka soda? Would you like another drink? You can't come in here. Hi, Marina. My name is Ben Fein. What do you want of me? I'm a detective with the police department. I need to talk with you. Marina, we will protect you. These guys are going to kill you next. Why did your friends kill the priest? Look, I came here so Boris and his ugly friend wouldn't know that I've spoken with you. Now, we can keep that a secret until the trial. But if you don't tell me what I need to know, if you don't tell me, then I'm going to have to take you downtown as a material witness. Now, if I do that, they're going to know that you've been to the police station. Oh, god. Marina, look-- No. You give me no choice. I've got to take you downtown-- No. I'm not exactly asking you, OK? Marina, you're going to have to talk to me one way or the other. Do you understand me? They killed priest because Volodia tell him something. Volodia, he is Catholic. You know, Catholic talk to priest. Make confession? Da, Volodia make confession to priest that Boris and Elia kill Polish man. Pulaski his name. Adam Pulaski. Who's that? A fence on the South Side. He and his whole family were murdered a few weeks ago. MARINA: Pulaski steal from them in drug business, so they kill him. They kill his wife and even childrens. Volodia come to me, he cry, he say he must speak with priest. How did Boris find out that the priest knew about the killings? How? I tell him. Why? Why did you do that? I drunk and say Volodia feel bad and talk to priest. But Boris, he get very angry. He say priest must die. But priest never can tell to police. It is against religion. He cannot talk to anyone. But Boris-- Boris, he not care. Volodia talk to priest to tell him to run away, but priest not do it. Why do you stay with this guy Boris? Why? I scared of him. All right. Come on. Where's Marina? [gasps] She's with us. Don't even think about it. No. Marina. No, please. Policeman, go home and hug your children. Benny! Benny! Benny! Get them out of here. I'm all right. I'm all right, Pop. I'm all right. What the hell are you leaving them out here for? We got plenty of probable cause. We've got nothing. We've got enough to put them behind bars. They'll run right out again on bail. You let me have them for a while. No, Benny, no. We'll get them. We'll get all of them. [tender music] Your father, when he was about, hmm, 15, he had a fight in front of Baum's Butcher Shop. And one of my girlfriends, she ran home and called me. I got there just when it was over. Your father beat up four guys because one of them said that he had cheated him out of some money. Your dad bought this beat-up old bike from this kid, who later came back with three friends and said he wanted more. Said no Jew was going to cheat him. Your dad blew up. There was so much blood on the sidewalk that you could smell it. We had to take your dad to Mount Sinai for stitches. But those four guys, they were busted into pieces moaning. I saw seven teeth on the ground. I think you can spare us the graphic details. The whole neighborhood, they treated your father like a young Juda Maccabe. What I'm trying to tell you is, and you'll pardon me for intruding with my opinion-- Shelly, we all know that Pop's a tough guy. And we know he's scared for us. Scared? He's been scared before in his life. He was scared when your mother died and left him with four kids. This is different. This is terror. In his whole life, I don't think he ever knew what it meant to be terrified. But now he does. This isn't about boys fighting. These are serious killers. So what do you want us to do, Pop? What I want is too late. I want you to be an accountant. I didn't learn my multiplication tables till after I was married. And you, Eddie, I wanted you to go to medical school. And you? You think it's all a game. No, Daddy, I don't. Daddy. Kate, I guess I screwed up. I'm as much to blame as you. I wanted what you wanted. Except for maybe Ben as an accountant. But I couldn't change anything either. Ben would be a cop no matter what you or I did. Eddie had a shot at medical school, but he decided different. He's a big boy. And Jackie, well-- hey, better a cop than wrapped around some guitar player's leg in a music video, huh? It would be nice if we all had safe desk jobs. Nice for you, maybe. Not so nice for us. It's a little late in the game, Daddy. We are who we are. Boris. Mel, I want you to keep Maya home from school today. Hey, hey. What's the matter? Just catch them, Benny, please. "The sneezy snoozer sneezes when the sneezy snoozer chooses. It's nose is as it pleases." Wrong. You said, "the sneezy snoozer sneezes," Aunt Shelly. Can we watch a "Gargoyle" tape? Ar Gargoyle? Sure. I just pray to God that you girls weren't born with your father's appreciation of culture. Does God always answer a prayer? Yes, but sometimes he says no. [gunshots] Come on! BEN: Get down! Everybody get down! [gunshots] Tali, come on. Come on. [gunshots] Maya! Daddy! Mommy! Tali! [gunshots] Ah, the baby! The baby! The baby. Come here. Under the bed. Under the bed. Honey. MAYA: Daddy! [gunshots] Maya. No, no, no, no. Stay down! Get down! Get down. Just-- look-- look at me. You stay where you're at. Don't move. Don't move. Tali! [gunshots] Shelly, where is she? Tali! Tali! Tali! [gunshots] [frenzied chatter] I don't want to hear that. You guys in CID are supposed to know something. I want the names of every man and woman that you suspect of being in the Russian mafia. Is that a hard thing? We're already working around the clock-- Just listen to me. Listen to me! I want to know who's on the top of this heap. You got it? Ben. What. In my experience, you can bust every Russian out of Wisconsin and still not find out who's calling the shots. All right. You guys come up with something, please. I need something. Hey. Ben, he's right. The CID has been investigating the Russian mafia for the past five years and they still don't know who's in charge. I don't know what we can do to find him. Maybe we'll get lucky and they'll find us. [suspenseful music] Just us. Everything's clean upstairs. House will be covered all night, Pop. I'm going to leave Meyers and another officer here with you. Jackie and Kate are at my house, so I don't want you to worry about us. You just kick back and watch TV, all right? - See you in the morning. - All right. Let's go. Can I have your car keys? Cover for me, will you? Be careful. Here you go. . It's going to be a long one. Who's Victor? What do you want? Tell them I want the deal. I'll be waiting in Lake Park East End in one hour. I'll be alone. [suspenseful music] We take you to Boris. Please give us your gun. You wanted deal. This is it. [gunshot] Policeman! [gunshots] [gunshots] Elia? [car starting] [gunshot] [car crashing] Enough. Not yet. You're just the monkey. I want the organ grinder who sent you after my family. Inspector. I'm here to see your husband. Yes, may I offer you something to-- I'm here. [speaking russian] [speaking russian] [speaking russian] So, what can I do for you, Inspector? You ordered your men to kill a fence named Pulaski, and his family. Volodia confessed about the murders to Father Mick. He couldn't say anything because he learned about it in confession. But I know you're the slime that's been attacking my family. Boris has made a full confession. So that's only check, not mate. Well, I've got the last move. You're under arrest. So. You want to die? You know I can make that happen. You saw how I got to your children. You think I'm afraid of you, of jail? I'm not afraid of anything. Yes, I had the priest killed. So what? I'd kill the pope. I don't care. I am the pope. I'm 10 times pope, 50 times the pope! Look uh, I'll make you an offer you can't refuse. Like Marlon Brando, huh? I like Marlon Brando, and Pink Floyd. Listen, deal is you don't bother me, I won't bother you or your family. All right? Alex. [speaking russian] Yannis. You didn't really kill the priest? Yannis. Please, Yannis. Tell me you didn't do that. Yannis, please. PRIEST: Body of Christ. PRIEST: Blood of Christ. Amen. WOMAN: Amen. Body of Christ. PRIEST: Blood of Christ. PRIEST: Body of Christ. PRIEST: Blood of Christ. Amen. PRIEST: Body of Christ. PRIEST: Blood of Christ. MAN: Amen. Amen. PRIEST: Body of Christ. PRIEST: Blood of Christ. MAN: Amen. Biggest chickens I've ever seen. My aunt scours the kosher butcher shops. She has chicken radar. I think she hunts them in the wild. It's nice to see you smile and laugh. Last time you looked so woeful. Woeful Woeful? That's an old-fashioned word. Well, I am old-fashioned. For instance, I think the problem with America is that there are no more porches. I have other theories in case you want to hear them. Yeah? Any of them about women? Hmm. No. All I know is that the kind of woman I want always costs more money than I've got. Well, um, this woman isn't costing you anything. At least not tonight. Here, take these guys in before they get dry. Come in, come in. Hi. Good Shabbos. I'm Aunt Shelly. Yes, I-- I know. Well, of course you do. You're a detective. - Hi, Pop. - Hi. - Hi, Ben. - Well, come on, partner. I want you to meet my wife. Come on. OK. Excuse me. Certainly. She's a beautiful girl, and I stress the part girl. And she's a cop, which means you both have a lot in common. Daddy. Good Shabbos. Hey, what happened to you? Oh, shooting range. Shotgun recoil. Come on, I want to show you something. Hey. I cannot wait till Jackie graduates. She won't have to wear my clothes anymore. Something's telling me that Jackie and her boyfriend spent a whole weekend drilling holes in each other's teeth or something like that. Yeah, that sounds like Jackie. Oy vey. Hey. Here, meet the rest of them. I want you to meet a lady detective. This is Tali. Ladies. BEN: Say hello. It's nice to meet you. Now let's go back, OK? I'll see you in a minute. Excuse us. It's a nice family. You're only missing your partner. Your wife. By me, you make a fine partner. Come on, everybody, it's time. You know they don't let you cut holes in the knees your police uniform, Jackie. I'm not going to wear the uniform long. I'm going to be a detective. I'll re-plate my old shield and have it ready for you. Oh, Dad. No more gefilte. What's in it? - Looks good. - Fish, duh. Shh, shh, shh. [speaking hebrew] - Amen. - Amen. Amen. [speaking hebrew] Amen. Amen. Amen. Ben. Napkin. Thanks. Here's to Pop. I'm proud of every one of you. My family. L'chaim. [music playing]
