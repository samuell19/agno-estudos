Ladies and gentlemen, President Harry S. Truman. My fellow Americans, I want to talk to you plainly tonight. We are trying to prevent a third world war. - You catch one? Go hand it off to Joanna! - It's just a bug, Isabel! - Hey, c'mon now. Sorry. - Rascal. - Whoa, there. Slow missy. - Yes, Mama Shan. - I've told you before, Shannon is fine! 10, 11, 12, 13. 13 counts of green beans. Okay. - And one bag of flower. One bag, that can't be right. Joanna, look, look! - Even if we fill that whole jar, it's not gonna last us more than a week. Who's to say it's even edible? - We could go to the moldy food, that would give us about a week if we eat around the edges. - Martha, we have no choice. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Did we upset my little niece? I promise I will not mention such things again. - Thank you, Aunt Martha. - Here. Why don't you go upstairs and we'll finish up here? We must be mindful. That child is not well. - The weeks inside are not helping. - Shall we continue? - Well, let's get to it. Shannon, what have you added to today's roster? - Your boy cut his knee again on something in that closet. I warned him the last time to stop messing in that closet, I did! But he never listens. He must've hit a loose nail or something. Cost us... one bandage, one cotton ball and about two ounces of alcohol. - Very well then, I will speak with Tomás. - He don't listen! - Horen. I saw you working earlier. - Oh yeah, yeah. See, I noticed some cracks on those stairs. Went and plastered the thing right up. Very good. - Oh, Felix, you'll love this. I noticed that my spit actually stretched the stuff out a little, made it last a little longer. So I only used about a dime's worth of the stuff. How's that? - That's very good, Horen. Very economical. - That's disgusting. - That was it. No other repairs. - My girls tell me that we're down to our last bottle of bleach. 121 ounces remaining. Martha? Go on. - I'm afraid we're low on food. - What? How low? - Well, if we continue as we have, about a month of supplies left. A month? And we will have to further ration our current supply in order to have that much. - But there's hardly enough to go around as it is! Have we heard anything from the outside? Perhaps the quarantine has ended and people have returned to their homes. - And perhaps the Commies will spare you for your stupidity. - Come now, please. I'm afraid the outside has been silent. It isn't practical to depend on the unknown. - What if Horen sought help? From the outside? - You sure have some nerve. Trying to make me leave my own building. For Christ sake! - You heard her! Are you kidding? I'm not gonna get killed! You know this place better than anyone. You think I'm gonna let you stay in this building by yourself? - What can be done? - You are just ridiculous! - Please, stop! - I'm afraid we must take action. Think I'm gonna sit around and watch my children go hungry? I think Shannon is right. We have to explore the outside. But we already decided that it's best to stay inside until we heard news. - Yeah, we don't even know if the Commies dropped it. I can't leave my own building. - And you shouldn't, okay? You know this place better than anybody, you should stay. I will go and I will go alone. - You? No, no, no, we can't have you go out. You could get hurt! - Well, I'll wear a protective suit and we'll pray for the best. - Well, so much as it pains me to say, I believe that Felix is right. Without an excursion, we may not survive. And he is the most well equipped. I propose a vote. - No. No votes. Everyone cool it! Come on, Felix, think about this biological disease crap. The president just doesn't evacuate New York City for nothing. - Well, I'm afraid we have no other options, Horen. - But your kids! - My kids? Tell me, what good is it for me to stay if only to watch them wither away, eh? Now a vote has commenced. All those in favor? Yea. - Yea. - Yea. - Yea. Those opposed? - Nay. - Then it's decided. I will leave in the morning. - Your courage will save us all. - My children will need you, Martha. - And I will be there. Horen, perhaps you could grab the children before the meal starts to spoil? - As if that dog food was ever any good. Hey kids, c'mon down for dinner. - What is it? - It's not good. - That's it? - Rationing, Shannon. - Ridiculous. - There you go. There you go. Ay yi yi. Okay, children, we need to discuss a new plan for everyone here. Would that be okay? You see, this biological threat from last month, the thing that may be outside, it doesn't seem to be improving. But no one is to fret, as we have come up with a solution. I will be taking a short leave to find us some more fresh food, okay? - You're leaving? - But, Papa, why do you have to leave? - Yeah, make Horen go. - Again? - It's his building! - Yes, Papa. - Do you really have to go? - I'm afraid so. But Martha and your brother will see that you are all taken care of when I'm away, okay? - No, Papa! No! - No. He's going for everyone. It's okay. Don't yell, it's okay! - Please, please! - Jesus. - Mira, mira, mira, crying and yelling is not going to solve anything, okay? We have to do what's best for everyone here. It's only going to be for a short time. - Okay, children, eat up. - Yes, Mrs. Martha. - Yes, Mrs. Martha. - We must give Felix time to prepare. - You can't just leave us all here! What are we supposed to do? - Grab me another rag. No. No. No, Papa. - What? ♪ Shine so bright ♪ ♪ Hope they're shining for me tonight ♪ ♪ Caught in the magic ♪ ♪ I'm caught in those angel eyes ♪ ♪ Angel eyes ♪ ♪ Smile this way ♪ ♪ Though the smile never gives away ♪ ♪ All that you're thinking ♪ Tomás, come out. ♪ Those angel eyes ♪ - Where did everyone go? - I asked them to give us some time. Come, sit. - Okay. - It's a scary thing what's happening, no? - Yeah. - Many a strong man must face fear. What's important is not that you see it but that you stand up to it. Do you understand what I'm saying? - Yeah. Yeah. - Tomás. Things will get difficult. They may even get scary. But a true leader must guide and protect while still concerning themselves with the greater good. Of everyone's greater good. I'm trusting you to listen to your sister's needs and to protect them. Can you do that? I need you to answer me. - Yes, okay, yes. - Good. Good. - May I use the toilet? - Go ahead. - Them adults sure are dumb sending out Mr. Soto. - I know. But Martha thinks it's for the best. She's usually right about this sort of thing. I wish you could've heard what they said in that meeting. - Yeah, 'till they catch me listening. Give them the perfect excuse for kicking out one of us foster kids. - Martha wouldn't do that. - Pfft. Half the places I been kicked out of say the same thing. Think he'll really be leaving? - I don't think he has a choice. We're running out of food... Fast. They have to do something. - Yeah, but Mr. Soto? I mean, without him, them adults aren't gonna know what to do. You all right? - Yeah. It's just something my mom taught me back upstate. For my problem. Deep breaths. Martha. - Don't forget to knock twice once you're out the foyer. So we can repair the wood quickly and double check before passing any dumpsters or tall buildings. Those Commies could be hiding anywhere. - I will. - Just be safe. - Thank you. Stand, son. I want you to remember what we talked about yesterday. I need you to protect your sisters and look after the other children, okay? Tomás! Tell me you're gonna do that. - Yes, okay. - I love you, mijo. I love you. - May we please have all the children step back from the door? Well Felix, there doesn't seem to be a better time. - This is true Martha. I guess it's only proper that I should say something, eh? Please, children, friends, don't look at this as a loss but instead as an exciting promise! I'll be back within the week! And I'll be back with fresh food, clean linens. Hey, perhaps some new toys for the children if they are good, okay? Well, let's get to this, huh? Adios, a mundo. Adios! - Okay children.

My aunt can be intense, but she's just trying to keep us safe. Okay? She must like us a little. Hmm? Hmm? - What did I say about that? No coughing. - Is she feeling okay? - Yeah, she good. Being inside has got her throat all sore. - Can I have some sugar bar? - You gonna be good? - Mommy used to love getting me sugar bar. Did your mommy get sugar bar? - I don't really know what that is but no. My mom doesn't really cook. - Well then what does she do? - Well when I was younger, it was just us so, she'd do just about anything for work. When I left, she was working in a factory. - You mean when you got the darkness? - Who told you that? - Martha told all us kids that you got the darkness. It's why we gotta give you space. - Yes. That's when I got the darkness. There. All better. - So where's your momma now? - You sure ask a lot of questions. Is she having a big slumber party too? - She could be. I don't really know. Let me just double stitch this part. - Ha. Good as new. - Thanks. You okay, honey? Joanna? - Yeah. Yeah. - Oh, Joanna. Just taking some proper precautions. Just to keep you safe, my dear. - Safe from leaving? - Well, yes. And I promised your mother I would be mindful. Well, don't wait for us, just... go on. We talked about this already, Isabel. - What if something gets in the building, like the virus? What will we do then? - Isabel, you need to relax. - Papa said he would only be gone for a week. Did he say anything else to you? Ugh! ♪ Angel eyes ♪ - Tomás! ♪ Smile this way ♪ ♪ Though the smile never gives away ♪ ♪ All that you're thinking ♪ ♪ All in those angel eyes ♪ ♪ I'd like to know ♪ ♪ I'd like to see ♪ ♪ Beyond the smile enchanting me ♪ ♪ And if I knew ♪ Tomás, you okay? - Fine, thanks. - Tomás! - I said I'm fine, thanks! Just pull it open. I can't, it's stuck! Tomás, are you holding the door? Tomás, just let us in already! Here let me try. No, I almost have it! Tomás, come out! Tomás, stop this! Come on! He's not even listening to you, Isolina! What are you doing? Tomás, stop this already! What is wrong with you, Tomás? - Nothing, nothing. - What you writing, my dear? - How much longer will you be? - Perhaps another 10 minutes. - I'm trying! - Keep it down, and I'll get you some sugar bar. What? - Martha's putting a lock on my door. - You too? Put one on ours. Said it was to protect Rhonda. - This can't be good. - What the fuck? Oh God! The children! What is happening, Walt? - Hurry, come here! You two get the gas masks, meet us in the dining room! Do it now! Here. Abrahem. Abrahem. Wear the mask. Put yours on first, dear. The window! Joanna, no! What about that crack on the ceiling? Anything there? Nothing. And that wallpaper's been like that for years. Just go upstairs. - Coulda just been an earthquake for all we know. - But we must take proper precautions, Horen. Let's talk about this later, shall we? How are the children? - Good. Tomás cut his elbow so I had to use a bandage but-- - Mm-hmm? - That's it for now. - Well, very good. - Aunt Martha? - Yes, what is it? - May I speak with you? Privately. - Things are very busy right now, Joanna. Okay, just spit it out. - Okay. I saw something out the window during the shake. - What was it, honey? - It was a balloon. A bright yellow one. - Martha? - With the brightness of that old sun she saw that and much more, but it was simply a mirage. - It wasn't a mirage, I'm sure of it. Where'd you see it? - It floated past. Right before the window got boarded up. - Oh, Joanna. Now it's been a long day and there is no reason for you to create these stories now. - Well, shouldn't we at least ask some questions? - She needs rest for the darkness. - I'm fine. - Christ, let the girl speak! Joanna, honey, was that all you saw? - Well, yeah, but... I only had a second to look. - All right, that's enough. I'm not gonna let your lies create chaos in this house. We have to concentrate on keeping ourselves safe from the disease. Do you understand? Not some non-existent object! - Aunt Martha. - Not another word or you'll be without breakfast! Now go to bed! And you will continue to help Shannon and you will do work as I see fit. Now no more talk of this nonsense! She is damaged! And I can't believe you are so simple-minded to leave that child. - No, of course not, ma'am. - Mother? The doors! No, Mother, stop! - Who's there? - Mr. Burton, I was just looking for some-- - No need to tell me. You're just taking from the man. Oh, excuse me, woman. Besides, I could use the company. Come on, it's my last one. - Martha said that stuff's just for bad cuts. - Yeah, well, Martha says a lot of things. That woman's vibrato can slay a cat. Or an elephant. Eh, I should've known right when she asked for her own set of keys. Sure feel like a real fathead now. And where does she get this poppycock idea that some slabs of wood will keep the Commie disease out? I can guarantee you the White House isn't covered with planks of crummy wood, ya'know? - So you won't tell her I was down here? - Why would I? Damn woman changes the locks in my building? Those Reds can take her for all I care. Why you up anyway? - Can't sleep. - Me too. Can't stop thinking about that damn balloon. - You believe her? - That was the most pep I've ever seen from you. Yeah, I believe her. Guessing you do too? - Probably the only thing I know is true. - That must be nice. Hey, we'll figure out what's going on outside, don't you worry. We just have to work together and stay safe. Ya got that? - Yeah. Thanks. - Hey, you looking for cookies in there or what? 'Cause I can tell you there ain't any. - Oh, no. It was something for my sis. - Well, better go get it then. I can keep a secret. My late wife, Louisa, used to get me honey when my throat hurt. That should be in the middle right. - Thanks. - Hurry now. You don't want Martha to hear her coughing like that. - I wish those adults listened to you more, sir. - You and me both, kiddo. - Thanks. - You and me both. Well, let's get this over with. - We cannot take yesterday's events lightly. What do you suggest, Martha? - It's time we take action. Felix has been gone nearly two weeks by my count. Who said that was a bad idea? - We need to send someone else out for supplies and for Felix. - Someone else? Here, here. - Oh, so are you volunteering to go out in whatever that is yourself? - Actually, I was thinking you should. - Makes sense. - How? How does any of this make sense? - Sorry. We don't even know what, if anything, is out there. - Exactly. We need someone to investigate and bring us back information and why not send the healthiest man we have? - That's precisely what I was thinking. - How will this help us? - It won't. - You could search for supplies. Perhaps get more cigarettes? - I see what this is. Can't you see she's playing us, Shannon? Jeez. First, you say there's danger outside. Now you're saying we should go exploring? If you're so goddamned interested in what's out there, why don't you go yourself? - Horen, please don't let your fear of the outside bring hatred to this household. - I am not afraid of nothing. But I can goddamn guarantee that you're not gonna make me go out there. This is my building! - And what do you suggest? That we all starve? That we watch our children turn into bones and skin? We can only ration our meals so much further, Horen. - Oh Lord, not again. - You must go. - I must not do anything! Last time I checked, this was still a free country! - Are you sure about that? - Yes, I am sure! This is our best option. Why don't you listen to this? You know, the children are going to hear this and then we're going to have to explain it to them. - I'll go! - Joanna, you should be the last one listening in. Get back upstairs now. - No. - Excuse me? Is there someone else up there? All of you, back upstairs now! - You need someone to go outside, right? Well, I don't even really live here. And you've all been so nice to let me stay while I... get better. But I can help. - You will do no such thing. I made a promise to your mother that I intend to keep. - But I can go, Aunt Martha. I saw the balloon. I wanna help for once. - And you're still experiencing these delusions. Child, you need to sleep. Abrahem, will you take her upstairs, please? - Just give me a chance, Aunt Martha. I'll do a good job, I promise! - I'll go! I'll go! - No, Mr. Burton! - Shannon, why is your foster child chiming in on this? - Hush! - But he's right, why should Horen have to go? - I don't have to do anything, honey. But I am out of cigarettes. Plus I wanna see this balloon you've been talking about for myself. Some of us believe you. - Prepare a suit for him. And don't ever question me again. - Why didn't you let me go? - They won't listen to you, Walter. Mr. Burton? Walter, come on in. - You really leaving? - Sorry, kiddo. Whatever's out there's gotta be better than this. Besides, I want to get me a look at that balloon your friend saw. Can't wait to see Martha's face when I come back and tell her that. - So you're coming back? - Of course I'm coming back. And I'm gonna have Felix with me and I'll tell him all the crazy shit that woman's been up to. Hey, I'm gonna need someone to keep an eye on my stuff while I'm gone. You think you can handle that for me, kiddo? - Yeah, I can do that. - Good. - Walter, guys, come quick! Mother? - You ignorant child! - Thanks, honey. I like the fight in you. Keep it up. Girls. Take care of my room like we said? - Yeah, I can do that. Well, let's get this over with, I guess. Cloths. ♪ The night was mighty dark ♪ ♪ So dark you couldn't see ♪ ♪ For the moon ♪ - We're calling a meeting. - What is it? - Martha's napping. We wanted to meet because them adults have been scaring us. They must have you guys scared too. - My aunt won't listen to anyone. We're worried. - But Martha takes care of us. - Not no more. - I saw something out that window. It was a bright, yellow balloon full of life. And Martha doesn't want to hear it, she won't listen. - And she made Horen leave. He would've helped us. So what do we do? Well, the first step is finding out if it's safe outside. We're just not sure how. - Even if we find out that it's safe, how do we get out? - We'll have to convince the adults to let us have a say in things. - And if they don't listen? - I'm good with locks. I could go in the kitchen, I could steal some rope. We could tie them up. - Just until we get outside and, and then we'll show them that it's safe. If it's safe. - What do you think? - Papa said that Martha will protect us. Yeah but is she? We should wait for Papa. How much longer are we gonna wait? Look, we've been told that adults are supposed to take care of us, protect us. But how can they do that if they can't even agree with each other? Okay, we can't keep waiting for them. We have to do something. - We're in. - Okay. Then everyone just keep an eye out for anything that could tell us what's going on outside. Cracks in the window, changes in the light, anything. And then we'll meet back here when we have more information. All those in favor? Yay. - Yay. - Yay. - Yay. - Yay! - Very well. Let's conclude this meeting for now. Martha will be waking up soon. Everyone just keep an eye out and we'll meet back when we have more info, okay? - You know, I actually have some ideas that may help. - Great. You can tell Walter on the way out. - Oh, okay. I think this is the right move. - Yes, certainly. Isolina, let's go. - That was good. Isolina is smart. We oughta talk to her. Joanna? - I'm not sure how much longer I can stay here. - You oughta come downstairs, now! - Joanna. - Identify yourself! Papa? - What's happening? - I'd say someone wants in. - They're gonna break down the damn door! - We are armed and cocked, identify yourself! Get upstairs, go! Horen! You may be contaminated! You must exit immediately! Horen! I'm warning you now! We can not take this lightly. - Oh. Hey, kiddo, you're a sight for sore eyes. - Mr. Burton, where did you-- - You're not sick. - Horen, I mean it! Exit now or endure the consequences! - What did you see? - Back! Back, boy! Quick! Get his body out, could be carrying the disease. - Oh. Oh my God. - Shannon! This is a state of emergency! Don't act like an invalid! - Yes. Yes, ma'am. - Quick! Before he infects the entire building! I don't know how you got out of your rooms but you better go back to bed now! Now! Finally here to help? - Oh, no, not quite. - Oh well, I think it's time you start. You need to spend less time with that orphan boy, anyway. He seems to be hindering your recovery. - I think we should talk. - Oh well, perhaps if you helped out more there would be time for talk but not now. - We need to talk about Horen. - Why would you say that name to me? - He just looked so... normal. - Do you think something was wrong? - Who's to say? He was never easy to read. - At least he got to have one more smoke. - He must've raced to the grocer to get them. - Do you think he saw Papa? - If he did, I'm sure they found a cigarette to share. - Yeah, I bet they did. - We can't pretend like last night didn't happen. Leave it, Joanna. - He wasn't even sick. What if it's okay outside? - Who's to say Horen wasn't sick? He may have just not been displaying symptoms. Now stop this this instant! Tomás, come out here! Just a minute. You better open these doors right now! What is he doing? - Tomás! - Tomás! - Stop! - I just think there should have been more of a discussion. - I don't require permission. Stop! Tomás! You're going to make me break the door if you don't stop! - Maybe some of the kids can start sitting in on meetings. - Open this door now! - You get out of there this instant, young lady! - I'm sorry, ma'am, but he won't come out. Who? - Our brother! - Tomas, this is Martha. Open the door right now. What exactly is going on in here? - Nothing. - Really? What, you're just hiding from your sisters? That's not very nice. - I... I guess. - What do you think your father would say about this? Up now. - Aunt Martha, he's just tired. Let's get back to the count. - Get up now! - What? - Get out of the room now! Not only has he threatened this entire building but we're using nearly half our medical and construction resources for repair. Tomás will be denied two meals for this burden. Mm-hmm, yeah, check everywhere. Even the smallest places. Little scrap. Anything could be an infection. He's clear. - Hey, where are you two going? - Little Rhonda just had to use the lavatory. - Oh, well, why don't we have her inspected first and then you can be on your way, hmmm? - Martha. - How long you been sick, honey? - She good. I been with her all week. She ain't got nothing wrong. - Her forehead is quite warm. - We run warm. My momma always said that. - Look, son, I know that you love your sister but we have to take proper precautions, don't we? I'll tell you what, you put a gas mask on her and stick her in Horen's room. - I'm going too. - Oh. But if you both go then you might get sick too and we don't want that, do we? - I guess not. - She's gonna be fine. She'll be there a short time. That's okay, isn't it? - I guess. - Great. It's clear. - How is she? - She's weak. Her energy is very low and her throat is swollen. Can't tell if she's contagious. So I've isolated her in a dresser. - Any new information regarding the hole? Not much. The kid certainly created quite an opening. It's possible that something could've made its way in. - Something definitely got in. That little girl goes for weeks without showing any signs of illness then suddenly she's frail and unwell. We mustn't take this lightly. Who's to say that she won't infect the entire building? - Yes but... What if it's just a cold? - What if it's not? I'm not willing to take a chance on one orphan girl causing an infection, are you? - I suppose you're right. - Whatever you think best. - We mustn't risk our lives on a little orphan girl. She must be ejected. - Faster, come on! Save her! Rhonda, stay close, I'll find you! - Joanna. Rhonda! - Fight it! Fight the darkness, my niece. - Please. Just let me close the door again, she'll be fine in there. She won't make anyone sick, I promise! - Oh, I'm afraid we can't take that chance now. You're gonna be just fine. Start removing the wood for an ejection. Walter! Quiet already! Abrahem, take her out! - I didn't mean to wake you. - You didn't. What're you doing? - I have to get her. I need one of them suits. - I'm sorry, I tired. - It ain't your job. That's why I gotta go. - Walter, you won't even make it past the first door without waking them up. - I have to try. I'm all she got. - I can't believe she could do such horrible things. She was never the warmest person but she was always a good person. - Them nice people can turn mean. Put in the wrong situation. - What if we came up with a better plan together? Something that would actually get you outside and not just get you in trouble? - I'm listening. - You okay? - I messed up everything. If I hadn't made that hole, none of these would have happened. I was going through my baseball cards last week, hit the nightstand, made the hole and let in the disease. I just screw everything up. - Wait, when? All the time. - No. No. When'd you make that hole? - Last week. - My sister been sick for two weeks. No way that hole made her sick if it was just a week ago. Show it to me. - And it took up this whole space? - Just about. I covered it with this. - How much time do you spend in here? - Plenty. Why? - If anyone should be sick, it should be you. - No kidding. - And you look fine. Besides, more importantly, a hole this big, we should all be sick. If there really is a disease. We need to call another meeting. Now. And I think there should be repercussions for it. - Certainly. - Children, we will call for you when the meal is ready! - We demand to be included in the building meeting. - Excuse me. - We live here too and we deserve to be heard. - You're but children, you don't even know what you're saying. Now go back upstairs. Tomás, take your sisters upstairs. - Rhonda wasn't infected. She's been sick for nearly two weeks. Walter's just been hiding it. The hole's only been around for one week amnd Tomás and the girls have been sleeping by it the entire time and they're fine. - I feel great. - I bet it's safer out there than it is in here. - That can't possible be true, can it, Martha? We would've kicked that poor girl out for nothing! And Horen! - That little girl was sick. You ran her temp yourself. She was sick. - They ain't saying she wasn't sick, Abrahem! - Is this another one of your lies, Joanna? - It's not a lie. - First the balloon, and now this. - There really was a balloon. - Do you any of you really know this little girl who claims to be your leader? Which of you knows why she's here? Raise your hand, huh? Who knows why this girl's mother dumped her here, despite the dangers outside? My sister, her mother, was having dinner one night when this one had one of her episodes and began stabbing her with silverware. How many times did you stab her? 15, was it? Took a 200 pound man to just pull her off. She mustn't be trusted! Oh, she'll hurt anyone. Even herself. Now go ahead, pull up her sleeves. I bet she's covered in cuts. How much must a mother fear her own daughter in order to leave her behind? - Quick, Walter, as we planned, grab the rope! Leave her alone! Tie her up! - No! You cannot behave this way! Tomás, the rope! - Oh, you're childish if you think it's better out there. - I am a child, Aunt Martha. I'll be taking these. Well, thanks everyone, that wasn't quite what we planned. But thanks for sticking with it. So go pack. But only the essentials. - This is the only place Papa knows, I'm not leaving. - We can find a police officer once we're out. - Yeah. - They'll help us. - Because they'll definitely take our side. - We all already agreed to this! There's not even enough food here, we have to leave! You don't even know if there's food out there. It's safe here. Did you see what just happened? We have to go! Papa will come back for us!
