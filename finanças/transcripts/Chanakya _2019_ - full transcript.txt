From 1993 to 26/11, there were almost 15 terrorist attacks in India. In the list of countries affected due to terrorism, India is one of the top three. Pakistan ISI supports this terrorism but there is one person who architects it here. He is currently second most wanted criminal on earth. Needless to say, he’s No.1 for India. Ibrahim Qureshi! Fake currency, Drug trading. Serial bomb killing in 1993! Any terrorist activity in India is directly connected to him. Sir! Pakistan gives security to Qureshi with Paramilitary forces. Qureshi gets all the etiquette same as the country’s president. Those proofs along with all details and their addresses are acquired by RAW. Good work, Kulkarni. There will be G8 countries summit in two months. We’d appeal about obstructing terrorism in India, which is supported by Pakistan. And hand over Qureshi to India. So, collaborate all evidence and proofs and prepare a detailed report. We shall present that in the summit. Yes, sir. - Good morning sir. - Morning. - Hello - Sit down. - Good morning sir. - Yeah. -What’s happening? -Our agents in Karachi intercepted ISI calls. We decoded and it is a voice message. Let me hear. Hmm. Thank you, Sir. - Tell me. - Sir! The main accused in 1993 serial blast is Qureshi. His right hand Abdul Salem is going to Syria on 26th. So, what now? Sir! We are planning a covert operation. We’ll capture him and bring him to India. What are you saying, Kulkarni? A covert operation in Syria? Our healthy relation with that country will ruin if you fail. The international basic country image on India will be gone. Wait for two months... We'll think about it after G8 summit. Sir, Abdul Saleem is coming out for the first time in 10 years. We have no idea why he is coming. Maybe, they are planning an attack on India. Sir... Intel is strong. This covert operation will not be in the records. Arrange a press meet if the mission fails. Disprove that India has nothing to do with that incident. If we capture him by chance, Include the information he provides in the report and attend G8 summit. Ask them to hand over Qureshi to India. Sir! It’s a win-win situation. Please! Who will lead this operation? Arjun! Arjun Srikar. Marshal under cover. 12 missions accomplished! 100 percent success rate! Guys! Give me a sitrep. Head set point… Ravinder and Ashwin… 900 meters away. Ahmed in position! All set, sir. Copied! 15 on the ground floor… 20 on the first and... 10 on the terrace. 20 around the perimeter. In another 2 minutes, target will be there. Arjun! Confirm that AS is here. Ahmed! Get me the confirmation. There are 16 people in total with 3 cars! - Target is in the center car. - I want visual confirmation. Target’s wearing a mask. Ashwin, copied! Ahmed is right. All are wearing masks. Aadhi! Get me the retinal confirmation. I am trying to focus, sir. Movement is high... I’m unable to focus. Arjun! Without visual confirmation, I cannot go ahead. Let him step out of the car. - Peace be upon you. - And upon you, peace. Come. Ashwin! Get drone in position. Shit! Bloody! Arjun! Abort the mission now. Damn! Sir, Intel on Abdul Saleem is right. It matches with the details and the number of people. So, it is Abdul Saleem, sir. I cannot authorize the operation based on your assumptions. Sir! You need the confirmation, right? I will give it in 5 minutes. Arjun! What…? We lost the audio, sir. What? Guys plan B. Alpha 3. Down. Bravo 4 [SIGH] Delta 5 6 Who's that? Guys! Someone sneaked in. Army base, 800 meters away! Five seconds to hear the firing. Five seconds for them to react. Three minutes for them to reach us. Let’s do it guys! Who are you? I am Arjun. Indian! - You Indians!! - Sir. - We got the audio. Please confirm it, sir. Why do you need confirmation after the operation? Just take him and leave the spot immediately. Go! Go! Go! Fast! Fast! Come! Come! Come! Hey! Move the vehicle. Come on! Come on! - Come on…Hurry up. - Come on… Good. Shit. Army vehicles are approaching... We don’t enough time. Let’s go. Go! Come on, Aadhi. Fast! Come on! Gosh! Aadhi… Hey, go. No. Go…Go! Just go. Don’t bother about me. Shit... Hey, go away. Come... Give me your hand. Get up! Get up! Fast! Come on…Come on! Come on! Go… Go! Now to the pick up point… southwest. Arjun! Obey orders first. You’re making us tensed. Take care of him. - The operation is success, sir. - What if it goes wrong? We might lose our jobs. No! I would’ve been gone. Hey… Saleem Bhai! How are you? Don't mess it up, Saleem. India has changed... We are bad people now. They’ve already shifted those 15 bodies that came with Saleem to Karachi. Qureshi knows about it. It is difficult to manage Qureshi’s mind. Do you know his punch line? Expect the unexpected. - Greetings. - Greetings. Qureshi! You know what happens if Abdul Saleem starts speaking. Chief! Your ISI trains people to kill others. But, Qureshi trains in a way that they sacrifice themselves for country. Get it? Indians have forgotten me. I will make them sense the pain in the spine. I will remind them. [RADIO] Good morning... Delhi! Delhi is a place of beautiful people. Who are these Delhiites... People reach Delhi from the nearby cities... Ramakrishna! You disappeared after I requested loan from your bank. Yes, aunty! Everyone are taking loan and flying to London these days. Manager is scared. We will run away with your bank money. - Good morning. - Good morning, sir. Hi... Hi, Maya. Hi, Bharath... Hi, Raghu. After so many days. Who are you sitting in my place, sir? Sir! I am the manager of this bank. People who know me call me Bokka Parameswara Rao. Kids call me dad. Wife calls me hubby. Father and mother calls Hey. Will these details be sufficient? Do you want to know anything else? Sorry, sir... What are you doing here? What else should I do…? I might have taken 30 days leave in my 30 years of service. You took 365 days leave in 3 years of your service. I shouldn’t blame you. I should blame the people who gave you this job in sports quota. They ask me to give you leave. They want me to perform your duties too. How can I handle this? I went to play an important football match, sir. I gather my friends and family near TV whenever you say this. There will be a match but I never see you in it. Hey! Have you ever seen him? - No, sir. - That’s it. The coach and captain devalued me. I was on the bench as twelfth man. Have you ever supplied water to the players? Sir! I said that I am a player but not server. You shouldn’t have ego. A player must do all kinds of work. Okay, sir. Then, I will serve water in the next match. So you are not playing the next match too? Okay. Call up everyone in this list. - Haven’t they paid loans? - No! They paid the loan on time. They might forget about this bank if we do not keep in touch. - Just the way you forget the game. - Sir. There are 1000 numbers in the list. You shouldn’t at least reach 500 loaners by this evening. Sir! It takes until evening to give a missed call to 1000 people. Forget about the loan! Taking leave for a month to simply sit during game isn’t important. It is important to get as many loaners as possible on your first day. I am not as bad as your coach and captain. You are the single player in this match. - Rock it! - Sir. What is this, sir? This is not fair. – Don’t say anything. Mr. Ramakrishna? It's list of 1000 people? Yes, Mr. Srinu. Did he ask you to get at least 500 loaners? How do you know? You seat was empty so he gave us all the same file. We questioned him and he said that’s team spirit. So, did you call them already? Yes. - What did they say? - They scolded. Did they scold you? Some people used bad words. What did you do then? We didn’t care because it was on the phone. What should I do now? You should repeat the same thing again. - Hello. - Hello. My name is Ramakrishna. I am calling from SBD. Do you need personal loan, home loan or gold loan? Will you give anything I desire for? Mr. Srinu. Women talk openly. Make next call. Let’s close. Hello. My name is Ramakrishna. I am calling from SBD. [MUMBLING] He sounds like beep? Yes, Mr. Srinu. See Mr. Ramakrishna! You have two options. One is not care or scold them back. Do the second one if the first one is hard for you. Rock it. Reverse? Are they reciting mantras to listen silently? They are scolding you. - Yes, sir. Word for word and abuse for an abuse! You go ahead. I’m here. Hello. My name is Ramakrishna. I am calling from SBD. Can’t you understand when I say I am not interested? Who said that there is no interest? 12.5 percent for personal loan. 9.5 percent for home loan. - 8.5 percent for gold loan. - Sarcasm? - Don’t you dare make me angry! - What will you do…? You are crossing your limits. What limits? What limits am I crossing? I’ll cross even the border if I have to. That’s my duty. - How dare you say that to me? - I say will what I want. What will you do? My friend Peethala Srinu told me that you’d act rude if I am sensitive. - He is beside me. - Hey! You’re done! You are finished! What finished? What will you finish? What is it? Mr. Srinu! How did I do? Everything is fine. Why did you take my name and surname amidst the brawl? Team spirit, sir. Thankfully, you didn’t say my family clan name. I will say that next time. I am a great player. - Is it, sir? Excuse me. Where is the manager’s cabin? Right there. Thank you. See looks great, right? Why should we deal with sharp people? They’re dangerous. Oh! Is it? What is she talking to him? Our boss became messy. Maybe he tried to flirt with her... And she is yelling at him. Oh! Oh no! He is coming… Come, madam. Come. Here he is, madam... He is Ramakrishna. Hello! Were you the one who spoke to me disrespectfully? Yeah. That’s him. So, what? Thank you for the support, Mr. Srinu. Team spirit. What man? Why do talk about spirit and liquor? Mr. manager. – Madam. Today is Saturday. I am leaving because it is your closing time. Close all my accounts and change to Axis bank by 10:30 am on Monday. Oh, no! Don’t take any hasty decisions, madam. Have a drink at night. I mean, relax tonight and take a decision, madam. What do you mean? He tells when I should take loan. Will you say when I have to take decisions? No…That wasn’t my intention madam. Sir! Why are you pleading her? She is just one among crores of customers for our bank. You may leave. How dare you say that I’m nothing? Yes. So, what? - Mr. Ramakrishna. - Team spirit! Why are you shaking hands and smiling? Manager. – Madam. I should get a call by 10:30 am on Monday about handing over my accounts to AXIS bank. Otherwise, I shall reach out to consumer court and you’ll be on the streets. Goodbye. Okay, bye. - Go…We’ve seen many people like you. - Madam… Go… There might be many customers for a bank. But, she’s the only one for our bank. She is… We opened this branch for the sake of her accounts. - Is she that rich? - Yes. She is. Aishwarya ma’am. But, she is not Aishwarya Rai? She is richer than her. She is the management head for Blue dart, India. Do you know something? She can start up her own bank if she wants. Ask her start up a reserve bank, then. You must control your words. I don’t know... She gave me one-day time. You guys have one day. You should make sure that her accounts would be in this bank. Otherwise, I will make sure that both of you don’t stay here. - Sir… - Sir… - Who's that? - Ringtone. Okay. Hello. Yeah. Khaja Bhai. Khaja Bhai? How can you deny now? The guests are already here. Guests? You should come at least if you don’t have your men. It should be done according to the plan today. It's better we escape. Hello... Who are you? Aishwarya ma’am? Who are you? - Salman and Shahrukh Khan. - You stay silent. What happened, Bobby? Why did you guys come here? Kanika! Give me the phone. - I will call Police. - Madam. Please madam. Listen to me once, madam. Please madam. - I am just nothing to you. - Oh, no. That’s spelling mistake. Shut up. - Please madam. - Just get out. Tell us anything other than that and we shall do it. - Yes, madam. - Kanika! Send them away. Now! Let’s do that but you come. – What? Come. I will tell you. Go, madam. Go. - Please convince her... - Yes, tell her. Why does she always have bouncers around her? - Will our job be done? - We'll not give up. We'll beg her. Kanika! What are you doing? I don’t know what is going on between you people. But, they will listen to anything we say. Khaja Bhai is also not available, right? - This weekend will be wasted. - You wait, babe. You agree and we shall engage them into this. - No…No… I don’t recommend them for that. You don’t have to. Leave it to me. You don’t know about them. But, I understand their situation. Give me a minute and I will set everything. - Kanika. Mr. Srinu! Do you think she earned it all with Blue dart? No idea! It feels suspicious. Whatever... These girls are having a great time. We should also have something like this. Let’s go for it when our accounts get closed. - Let us do it. [CLEARS THROAT] Ma’am. We wasted lot of energy What did madam say? - She is very angry on you. - Is it? You should convince her. Otherwise, we might lose our jobs. - What will I get from it? - Mr. Srinu! What do you expect from us? Hello…Hello. Go to the main road. Take a left. Take right after going 200 meters. Go to fourth shop in the left. That is Agra Wines, not a shop. I am talking about the same shop. Bring 8 beers. Beer? I thought so. You’ll not lose weight unless you stop drinking beers. It is not to drink but to wash my hair. Hair thickens if you wash with beer. There are beer shampoos available for that. Why do you need beer? Is there no difference between mother feeding and canned milk? - Why is she comparing? - I don’t understand. Do you need comparison or help? We need job. They might ask even more beers for bath if we stay here any longer. Hey! Get 2 strong beers. They will be like you. Okay? Hot or chilled? - They’re still cold, right? - Is madam cool now? Will you say whatever you want? There is nothing wrong in punishing you guys. Get out! We’ll do anything you say except that. Come to Newton café at 11 tomorrow. We shall settle everything. Okay. - Madam! Bill. - It's okay. Keep it with you. Hey! Mr. Srinu! It is settled. Sorry. I am married. I said the bill. Who will pay the money? Do you need money or help? We need our jobs back. You need beer. Hey. We must try pizza over here. Greetings, madam. What’s with you? You come to office in the morning and home in the evening. Now, you came here. What? Are you stalking? No…we are not that kind. Don’t talk... Who told you that I’d be available here? She told that everything will be settled and we brought beers for you all. Please, madam. We don’t get salary unless we work hard the whole month. How can you say that? My decision is final. How can you say that, madam? Will you give the same punishment if it was your Bobby in our place? Mr. Srinu! Who is Bobby? It's her dog. Oh! Excuse me, madam. Order please. - Yeah. I’ll have one gluten free thin crust pizza. Extremely thin crust and I want you to add nice black and green olives, And I also want you to add lot of jalapenos, and less cheese. I want lot of asparagus in that. And as I already told you, add some cashew, chips and lot of… Brother! Send someone else. Thank you, sir. Hey! Why did you send him away? He’s a new guy. They gave him old uniform. He bought new shoes. He was trembling while taking order. His face expressions clearly show the fear of losing the job if he makes a mistake. Order please. Is that guy new? Yes, ma’am. Okay. I will you call you later. Thank you, ma’am. How did you know so many details in such short time? Human eye is 576 megapixels, ma’am. We humans don't use it , instead We use 16-megapixel cellphone. Is it? Are your eyes so powerful? Okay. How many tables are there in this restaurant? Everyone will say such philosophy if people listen. Total area is 4500 sqft. 11 tables, 44 chairs, 35 customers… 20 male and 15 female. 9 waiters… 2 managers and 2 cleaning staff. 10 tables are occupied... One table is reserved. 5 tables have food served. 3 tables are waiting for food. One table didn’t pay the bill. One table didn’t place an order. Bill counter is on the left side. Fire exit is in the kitchen. Your friends are looking at me and four guys are staring at them. Now, you are looking at me. You can say what you see. Can you tell something you don’t see? Madam… Madam… Please, madam. I told because she asked. Call our manager to keep the accounts. Madam… - Madam. You ruined it. I told because she asked me. Madam. “The burb beauty in the city” “I salute to the Queen of England” “Stop being rigid, the beauty of heights” “You are the only hope even if you trouble” “Don’t come to me with aggression like Baahubali” “Don’t shoot me with a James bond gun, O’ angry lady” “Stop shouting in that matter” “Acting like a lady Bruce Lee” “Stop this battle and change like Buddha’s sister” “Our life curled back because of you” “Our life became pathetic only because of you” “Blood pressure in the body goes high because of you” “Our verve is wasted because of you” “Baby Rosy! Lovely rose! You are the lifeline” “Baby Rosy! Lovely rose! You are the lucky star” “We are the die hard fans adoring you” “Cool down a bit and give us an autograph” “Oh no no, lady” “Oh ho ho, lady” “You are my lifeline” “How long should I face this trouble?” “How long should I wait?” “Our brains stop functioning” “Our bones become tender” “Don’t make us follow you like fools” “Don’t spoil our lives with your anger” “Forget your ego and listen to our story” “Just say okay for this time” “Our life curled back because of you” “Our life became pathetic only because of you” “Blood pressure in the body goes high because of you” “Our verve is wasted because of you” “Baby Rosy!

Madam…Please madam. Madam. Please madam. - Call your manager. - Madam! Call him. Will you ask him to remove the accounts or remove us? Tell me what should I say to get rid of you. I will say the same. Tell him that you’d keep your accounts. - Okay. Just a minute. Sir. - Tell me. - Madam will speak with you. - Okay... Madam. - Manager. - Madam. Thanks…Thanks madam. - Good morning, sir. - Morning. In the laptop that you recovered from Abdul Saleem... There is sensitive information related to RAW More than that, there is all the information about our agents operating in Pakistan. How did he get that, sir? You shot a guy wearing red jacket while capturing Saleem. Do you remember? That guy is RAW analyst. Saleem went there to get that information. But, we don’t know if this information reached ISI. No. It didn’t reach them. Our agents would have been captured by now if it reached them. That didn’t happen. It means the information is safe. Hmm. We got orders to submit Saleem in the court. It is too dangerous, sir. Saleem is the only one who knows these secrets. The information he had about us is dangerous than the information we expect from Saleem. They need Saleem alive to get that information. So, they will definitely plan to rescue Saleem. We got an Intel that they would rescue Saleem while taking him to the court. Why should we take him to the court in spite of knowing that it is dangerous? How can we protect our country if we fear this? Which route are you taking him? The route map is finalized. The court is 15 kilometers away from Tihar Jail. It will take about 20 minutes to reach there even if we control the traffic. These 20 minutes are very important to us. There will be heavy security near Tihar jail and court surroundings. They might try to do it on the way, sir. We must implement our plan on the way. Don’t bring him out. You might feel disappointed if you bring him out. I have orders to follow, Arjun. It is up to you and you decide, sir. The cops will be there at every 200 meters in the city. Every junction will have paramilitary forces. It is hard for them to rescue him from us. Bloody! We should place bombs on Indians. Laugh now. If something happens to me, India will pay the price. That’ll happen for sure but not India. It will happen for Qureshi at Pakistan camp. Bloody! Have you gone mad? When the hell will you stop this? Why do we need him, sir? He will not tell the truth even if he is alive. Qureshi will not stay calm until he rescues him. They might capture another Hotel Taj or hijack airbus to release him. Public will be in danger if he is alive. Our agents in Pakistan will be in danger if he escapes. it is very hard to convince Home Minister, media and human rights people? Do you even understand that? They are nothing compared to India. Abdul Saleem for trying to escape and those people for helping him escape… Say that the Army killed them. Everyone will be happy except Qureshi. While taking Abu Saleem from the prison to the court with full security… During firing between the Army and terrorists who attacked… Abu Saleem and his accomplices are dead. What do we do now? Enjoy your Tea. Hello Where are you? Sorry, dear. I forgot to tell you... I am having a party with my friends. Who are those friends you are partying with without my knowledge? They’re not new friends. Ramakrishna’s batch. Ramakrishna and all? Oh. Everyone must be busy boozing. Aadhi must be with him. Give it to me. I’ll talk. They disconnected the call. Hey, Arjun! This guy is married and has a daughter. His wife is pregnant. These two guys have so many girlfriends. – Sir! Don’t say that. What’s happening to you, man? I am not good with marriage, sir. We are all happy. Aren’t we? Sir! We lead two lives. One is reality and the other is fantasy. - Buddha! - Everyone knows what our fantasy is. We cannot share our reality with them. I do not like lying to a girl who enters my life with a trust. Come on, Arjun. The one who trusts you will understand you too. You don’t have to tell her the truth. The girl who understands you will trust you. You don’t have to lie for that. That’s all. It is very simple. Why do you want to complicate yourself? When will I find such a girl, sir? You’ll find her. Search! Search for it. That’s our job. - Exactly. - Cheers! Hey! Whiskey! Look at my face. Nothing will happen to you. Hmm? What happened? Bobby haven’t been eating and sleeping for a week. He groans in the night and barks in the morning. Is he groaning like this in the night? - Yeah. Exactly, doctor. - Oh! Does he flip his tail? He does that as soon as I come, doctor. I am talking about animals. Does he raise his leg while groaning? Whole night, doctor. Whole night? Hmm? Looks tiny but very strong! Is there any medicine? Medicine cannot cure it. He is of age and he needs a female. - What? Dogs have mating just like dating for humans. What should we do now, doctor? There are two cases. First is find a female dog for mating... Otherwise, remove. Remove? What’s that? These are breed dogs. Female dog should be the same breed. His life will be in danger if you mate him with any breed. Oh! Rare breed! Where can we find the same breed in such a big city, doctor? You don’t have to find dogs. Give 500 rupees to Puppy and you’ll get the address. Puppy? Do you think Puppy is a dog? Yeah. She’s my receptionist. - Oh! - Puppy. - Yes, doctor. Yes. Go. Hold him. Thank you, doctor. Did doctor give us this address? The address is correct. Excuse me. Is it you? What is she doing here? Is it your house? Sort of... Come in. Thank goodness. Come. Nice place. Oh! So cute! She’s just like Bobby. Aww! Baby. So cute! What’s her name? - Pecko! I didn’t come for you. I came for her. Actually, I have a male dog of same breed. Bobby! Doctor gave me your address as it is mating season. Doctor will remove if it is not done. They say a dog is a man’s best friend. I understand their feelings and came here for the mating. I am sorry. I am not interested. Why should you have interest? She should be interested. She is not interested. How do you know? You said that a dog is man’s best friend. Mr. Ramakrishna… It seems today is a dry day. Do you have some bottles? What are you doing here? You? Yes... Move! - What are you doing here? - Bobby has been barking all night. There won’t be any sound if you strangle him. Oh no. How can you say that? Leave your dog with Bobby for an hour. They’ll play. What is this, Mr. Ramakrishna? She will play with us when she’s angry. - Will she use our dog if her dog desires? - Nothing like that. See. I am raising her just for my company. She will get pregnant and have babies if I send her for mating. I don’t have time to take care of that. We should solve among ourselves if there are any issues. What did dogs do? Go away. You didn’t give us money when we bought beer. You let security drove us away while people were watching. You should have this common sense back then. Go away. Hey! What? This is too much. Do you think that you alone have this breed’s female dog? – Hmm. Then, ask them to leave, Mr. Ramakrishna. Why are they boasting? - Okay, let’s see. - Okay, madam. Go away. – Go. We don’t have time for all this. We should call our batch and setup some bottles. Good boy! We charge 500 rupees for one address. I will give you 5000 rupees if you come with me. 5000? Okay, thank you. [WHISTLES] Bobby! Snoopy is coming for you. Fresh! What’s her age? 3 months. Doctor! She’s too young. It might be a child abuse case. Let’s go. - Oh! Thank you. What happened? Hmm? - Stop staring and come. - Yes. It is young. Doctor! How are you? Good… Hi. – Hi. There’s your girl. Male dog? I mentioned the name and age but didn’t mention its gender. Shall we adjust with this for now? No! This could be gay sex, doctor. Supreme court has no restrictions for that. - Aishu! - Aishu? I don’t call people with their full name when I get closer. I don’t pay the fee when people get closer. Miss Aishwarya! - What? That beer boy’s dog is the only one left in the city. - He is not getting convinced. - Impress him. What if I do? Your Bobby is male. That beer boy is male. What if that guy has the same desire as your dog? What if it happens? There will be happy ending without pain. - For? - For your Bobby! Isn’t there another way? Only once. Fasak! Looks like an angel is walking towards us. I envy your luck. Will she complain again? I don’t know... No control at all. Ramakrishna! Come inside. Wait, madam. He is coming. Sir. What is this, Ramakrishna? Why did you deny when madam asked you a favor? - I am not interested, sir. - Why don’t you have interest? I am not interested to have you and that useless guy in this office. Am I not adjusting? I will have to face problems in future if I adjust now. What’s the problem? Is it about pregnancy if that happens? I will bring condom. Oh no! I already told you that I am not interested. I don’t want it for free. Tell me how much you charge for an hour. O’ Lord! Is your house an issue? I will book a resort. Ah? O’ my Lord… I am not convinced no matter what you say. Why don’t you understand when a girl requests you without feeling shy? Are you even a man? - Ramakrishna. - Sir. Perverts don’t even spare dogs these days. Lord Ram is born again, Ramakrishna. He’s born again. He got it all wrong. Please... Try to understand. Leave me. O’ my Lord! Why did you bring us here? This is our way. Let’s kidnap. - Kidnap him? - No... His dog. Come… I have some bunch of keys. - Use it. – Intelligent. It's open. Slow… [SNIFFS] Hey... What are you doing? We can sense the dog with the smell. Bedroom? Okay. My Pecko! [WHISTLING] Hey. How long will it take? Let’s go. Come. Let’s go to your love. Sorry…Carry on. Oh my God! Sorry…Sorry… I never said sorry these many times. Sorry. Please. Did you smile? Right? I thought you’d scold me and lodge a complaint for kidnapping. Thank God! - I thought the same. But, I got convinced after seeing you take a risk for Bobby. Thank you. - Will you have coffee? - Will you drink coffee too? Hello! I am not a drunkard. I drink for fun whenever my friends gather. Oh! Do you live alone? Yeah. Just Bobby and me! What about your parents? My mother is gone. My dad stays with another woman in Australia. I think that it would be nice if he come visits me at least once. But, dad thinks that it is okay to just talk over phone. He sends a gift on my birthday and makes a phone call per year. I miss my family sometimes. But, that’s life, right? So, I am happy. Coffee is good. Thank you. I saw your anger at the bank. Your tranquility is something new. I am not a monster. I am just like other girls... I have feelings too. Do you have a girlfriend? No. Boyfriend? I don’t call it love but I had a crush during ninth grade. It was a crush. I don’t have time to fall in love. Why didn’t you love anyone till now? Everyone think that I am stubborn. That’s right. You are stubborn. You didn’t get convinced even after requesting you a lot. I draped a saree for the first time to impress you. Do you know that? Saree suits you. Smile suits you. I am so happy to meet everyone like this. – Cheers, Arjun. All of us came with families. But, you came alone. Don’t feel bad... He'll come with a girl next time. Hey! What is Aishwarya saying? Aishwarya? Who is Aishwarya? The girl who is chasing him. Oh! Is he after a girl? It started at the bank. He went to office and coffee shop. Now, he visits her home too. Who is that girl? She is my customer at bank... We met because of bank work. Oh! You should meet her in the morning but not night at home while she’s alone if it is bank related work. He didn’t go alone. He took his dog too. It settled there. He should go and settle. - No! There is nothing like that. I don’t have such feelings on her. - You may not have. - But, she might have feelings for you. Give me her number and I will ask her. No need... She will come here. Just wait. - Is she coming here? - She is here. It is a family get-together. She is beautiful. Hi. – Hi. Hi. - Come on… Who invited her? Hi. Welcome to the party! Will you not introduce your girlfriend to me? She’s not my girlfriend. She is just a friend. Why did you tell that she is your bank customer earlier? Are you all childhood friends? No! We met during the training at Dehradun. Oh! Will they give bank training in Dehradun? No… It wasn’t the bank training. We got selected for the same football team. - That’s right. We met there during the training at Dehradun. - Ah! Nice… - Yes. Correct. What about your parents? I don’t have anyone. My parents worked at Army base. They died in a attack. I was brought up in Army campus and I studied in Army school. They all came into my life as friends. These people came as families later. Now, this is my family. Alright, guys! Let’s have shots. Okay? [ALL]: Cheers! Whoa! Excuse me. - One more shot, please. - Yeah, madam. Thank you. Wooo! I have to tell you something. What’s that? Hey! You said everything present in the coffee shop in a minute. Don’t you know the feelings of a girl? To your megapixel 576 eyes! Huh? [LAUGHING] Hey. I love you. I love you! You are drunk. Sit. Let’s talk tomorrow. I am serious, Ramakrishna. Aishwarya! You are high. I got high to speak with you. Okay. Now, stop the car. Stop! Don’t ask me how I took this big decision in just a week. I am not sixteen-year old girl to think immaturely. I am much more matured than you think. You know. I run a whole big company. Hey! I want to hug you and cry. I have a feeling that you get more excited than me when I am happy. There are hundreds of such feelings. Should I tell you everything? Don’t you understand? What? “Darling! My dear darling” “Why are you firing at me?” “Stop looking at me angrily” “Feeling! The feeling of my heart” “Is waiting in my eyes” “Identify and understand it” “I was a girl at ease, you took me to the skies” “Never say that there’s no love…” “…And revolute your words” “In a sweet little dream” “Let us be together” “Never curl back against the wall poster” “That isn’t your stance” “Stop playing around” “Just because a girl asks you” “Stop acting smart” “You cannot hide it” “The love that you feel” “You come into my dreams while I’m asleep” “You act like you know nothing” “You talk to me all night long” “You seem like you do not remember” “My heart is waiting” “To enjoy the essence of your love” “This charming beauty” “Is dying hard to be with you” “My man who earned everything” “Try to read out my mind…properly” “Darling! My dear darling” “Why are you firing at me?” “Stop looking at me angrily” - Ramakrishna! - Hey! I'll kill you. Sit in the car. Who sent you…? How did you get it? How did you get it? Speak! Tell me. - Sir. - Did you reach Arjun? Sir. It's Kulkarni. Sir! All my colleagues’ phones are not reachable. We were all together 10 minutes back. Please track the phone, sir. - Come to the headquarters. Immediately. - Okay…sir. I am coming. There was firing between you and them And all them died. - I want this guy. - Okay sir. By the way, drop her at home. - Okay, sir. - Arrange police security. Come on! Come. Speak. Speak. They have been abducted, Arjun. They left the families behind and took our agents. We can’t track them. [GRUNTS] Arjun. Why are you still pleading him? Tell me! Where is my team? Shit. [SCREAMS] How many of you came here? It is not important to know how many came. Ask me who sent us here. Who sent you? Who is it? [LAUGHS] Sohail. Sohail? Sohail Ibrahim Qureshi. Qureshi’s son! You, your army and... RAW… Even if you attack all at once, You can’t even reach the shadow of Sohail. [GIGGLES] Hey. Arjun. He’s the only evidence for us. I don’t care about it. I need complete details about it, sir. How can you investigate when he is dead? - Excuse me, sir. Oh my God! Arjun. Peace be upon you. It is painful to see your friends in this state, right? Hey! You’re hefty but not strong! What did you think would happen by killing Saleem? Did you think we’d keep quiet? No…No… You wasted time in 2 hours interrogation. I got them from Delhi to Karachi during the same 2 hours. Your brain functioning is slow according to me. Get updated. Hey! You read out RAW from left to the right. We read it out from right to the left. Then, RAW becomes WAR. When you start the war, we give it an end. The end! I’ve heard a lot about you, Mr. Arjun. Under cover marshal! 100 percent success rate! I felt good when I hear that. Seriously, I felt good. I challenge you... My men came to India and got four members of your family. Come to Karachi if you’re sturdy. Come and save your friends. Then, we can decide who is the toughest. Stay there if you are sturdy. I am coming. See you. What do we do now, Kulkarni? Sir, We must do something to save them. What do you mean by something? You know that too. Rescue operation sir. What nonsense! G8 summit is in few days... Prime Minister is also preparing for the summit. The world will be watching India... And you want to go Karachi for rescue operation? Senseless! You want us to simply leave them? Even if you lose your life while in duty or unclaimed by India, You join RAW as an agent after signing that no-objection bond. What now? You are worried about life. I am ready to give my life for the sake of India. But, they acquired our names and family information from Pakistan and kidnapped our agents. All the details he mentioned were accurate. That means he has good network in India. We need to know who is supporting him in India. That is RAW’s failure. Not even RAW. It's you! I am not talking about failure or success, sir. I am talking about lives of four agents. Look Arjun! Your cover is blown. Everyone knows who you are. So, you have no relation with RAW. Did you get that? In fact, it is a big mistake to involve you in this meeting. - Sir, we have to… - Sir, please. - Four of them did that for India. - Kulkarni! Will you ask him to get out or should I say it? Sir... Arjun! - Umm! I don’t know what to…. - Sir! I don’t want any support from the government. I don’t want any support from agents in Karachi. Just tell me to save those four agents. I am not a father or friend to say it emotionally. I am RAW chief. I have set of rules to follow. Approvals, authorizations, permissions… There are hundreds of calculations. You know that. So, there is no value for lives of four. - Is that so? - Yes. As per records, you and those four agents have no relation with RAW. RAW doesn’t know you. The country is the first priority for RAW. We are not here to save everyone who has life threat. RAW which cannot save lives of four people for country cannot save the country either. Arjun! As per the records, you are not my boss anymore. So, don’t try to stop me. Those four aren’t just colleagues but my family. I am their courage... They are my life. What are you doing here? Why didn't you go home? Where is the police security? How did they let you go? Who are you? Who are you, Ramakrishna? Go home first... I will tell you everything later. I will not go until I find out the truth. My name is not Ramakrishna. Sailu! They went to the police station... To lodge a complaint on abduction. I came to you. I came to find out the truth. Arjun. He told me everything when we were in love. I was scared at the beginning. I met you and felt confident that nothing will happen to him when you’re around. I am 9 months pregnant. My delivery date is due 10 days. When the baby is born, should I say that his father is alive or dead? The baby will see his father first. This is not Bank-Ramakrishna’s promise. It is Arjun’s promise! Do you now know who I am? Bank-Ramakrishna whom you loved is a lie. This is the truth. I didn’t like you because of your name or job. I decided to live with bank employee Ramakrishna. After knowing who you really are, I don’t want to be anyone else except you. I can't guarantee you my life... No one knows whose life ends when, Arjun. But, it is important to know with whom we spend our life. It is okay if that’s lifelong or just a jiffy. Love me when I am around, that’s enough. My passport has expired... Family is in Pakistan. The cops will arrest me if they found out that I am staying here illegally. 2 lakhs fees and other expenses are on you. Get it? I know.. I have the money. Come to Jaisalmer market tomorrow evening. The truck will go from there. Okay... Thank you, sir. See you. No more explanations, Kulkarni. I told you that there shouldn’t be any disturbances before G8 summit... It’s a blunder on your part. Sir! Please let me explain. RAW has nothing to do with what has happened. Arjun is not in order... He’s thrown out. He didn’t take leave at bank. There is no Intel that he went to Karachi except that he didn’t go to the bank. What’s that then? What does it mean? You know that Arjun is emotional. You know that he planned to rescue his colleagues. You know that your radar can't reach Arjun. What else do you want to know? Sir! That’s what I was trying to say. - No! I will not let anyone to become an obstacle for India. Send instructions to our agents in Karachi... Tell them to kill Arjun if they find him. Shoot at sight. - Sir! But he is… - Is that clear? Peace be upon you. I already told you we should not mess with Arjun or kill him if we have a chance. You did both. - What happened? If my guess is right, Arjun is already in Karachi. Are you laughing? Yes... He is doing exactly what I expected him to do, Azam. What? There is no use if predator and prey are at different places. Predator should reach out for prey or prey should come to predator. The prey came to the predator. Will it stay alive or die? - It's Arjun!! - I am Sohail here. Karachi is mine, Azam. Here there is death in every corner. - Is it done? - Yes - How much? - 100 rupees. Come, sir. - Can I get a bouquet? - Yes, sir. Tell me which one you want. Garden rose, Dalia, Lily, Silver Dollar, Pink Lotus. Take it. Thank you. “When there is darkness around” “There’s blaze in my heart” “When there is desire in my mind” “My body feels the fervor, When there are too many emotions” “I feel lonely in this gathering, There’s whirling in my nerves” “Rock-n-Roll night it is” “It’s an amusing wonderland” “Come on, dear!” “This dazzling weather welcomes you” “Hookah bar!

I have seen you. Come out now! - What are you doing here? - I need to talk. I have shoot at sight orders on you. I came this far in spite of knowing that... Understand the situation. I don’t care about situations... I will not ask you how you came here. I will not tell anyone that you are here. If not, I can even kill you. I wouldn’t have joined Raw if I was scared of guns... I wouldn’t come to Karachi if I fear death. Shall we talk? Their men are everywhere... This is not the correct place... I will give you an address... Come there. You’ll find Fatima market when you come straight from Masjid. Take second left from the market. You’ll find backyard of an old building if you walk straight for 500 meters. Open the door. Get in. Open the small window to your left. Put your hand on the small window on the right. Open it. 1… 6... 7... 9! What do you have to talk? Sohail! He captured four of my teammates and got them here... I need to find out where they are and why they were brought here. I have to take them back to India. Impossible... Sohail is not like Ibrahim Qureshi… …to operate the world with ten key people at ten places. No one knows Sohail’s next movement until the last second. He will not ask what he wants. Saying what to do, he will close the topic. Sohail’s planning constructive. The execution is destructive. Forget them if Sohail got those four people here. He might have killed them already. if that was his intention… He would kill them in India as soon as he found them. There won’t be such a plan and execution. Those four guys are definitely alive. I have to rescue them. Can’t you understand when I say? This is Karachi. Qureshi has seven houses here. No one knows how, when and where he stays. Awaiting the orders when we find him. Waiting until he’s found… No one can do anything… It's hard to capture Sohail. We can't catch him. We will catch him. Sohail isn’t a saint to sit at home while having such tight security. He is not doing any meditation. The one who plans to do everything himself can’t be at one place. What’s the plan? Where are the Intel surveillance cameras? Every route that goes to Qureshi’s seven houses has cameras. It’s not enough. I need cameras at every other road that connects to that road. 130 cameras. I fixed them where their surveillance cameras cannot reach. But, no use. Every person has a daily routine... But, Sohail doesn’t have any routine. Sohail may not have a routine but there is a clue in this video. Clue? when Sohail’s convoy is out on the road... There is no red signal. That’s a known fact. Qureshi’s family gets all the etiquette same as the president. That’s not a point. If Sohail’s programme was not fixed… If Sohail wasn’t in the convoy… That convoy should stop at the red signal. Traffic police every junction gets the instructions. No one knows Sohail’s program but the Karachi traffic department will know it. So, the commissioner gets encrypted information from Sohail. Where is the traffic commissioner office? We cannot hack Sohail and ISI mails with the equipment we have. But, if we decrypt commissioner emails… …we might get information we need. I need the daily routine details of the commissioner. The commissioner goes to office at 11 in the morning From 1:00 - 2:00 PM lunch. Evening at 6:30 he will be at a restricted pub. The commissioner will be at the pub daily from 6:30 to 9:30 pm. He's a womanizer. The security will be very less during the prayer time in the evening. We must utilize that time and decode Sohail’s emails from commissioner laptop. But, we need his fingerprint to access the commissioner’s room. I’ll get it. Nawaz! Put on the generator. Excuse me. Can I offer you a drink? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Hi. I am Ali Khan. Nice meeting you. Zubeda... Send me his thumb impression. I'm a big fan of your dance. Hello. I have sent you. Hello! Traffic Commissioner Office. Hello. Hello. I cannot hear you. Hello. Zubeda! thumb impression is not working. Can you send me the other fingers? Come on... Fast... Fast... Who is calling again? Hello... Why are you calling the commissioner office again and again. Voice command. Zubeda! I need voice command. Fast! There is no time. What’s your name? I didn’t hear you. There is a lot of disturbance inside. One minute. Mohammed… Ali. Mohammed Ali Khan. What? Mohammed Ali Khan. Any problem? Arjun! What happened? Is everything okay? Yes... It's copying. Arjun! He left... Hurry up. It is getting in... Can you hold him for sometime? Fast…Fast. Idiots... Come on…Come on! - Hey! - Sir... Check inside. What happened, sir? - What are you guys doing? - We went for prayer sir. Sohail will be going to his hotel tomorrow evening. Whom would he meet? Some private jet owner! So, what next? Please stop. Can you open the trunk? This is the star hotel that was mentioned in the commissioner’s mail. Welcome. There will be full security when Sohail gets here. He uses the lift at ground floor... It will go straight to the ninth floor. Have a pleasant stay sir. - Thank you. - Your welcome. Sohail who gets in the lift goes directly to the ninth floor. But, we should stop it in the fourth floor. All the cc cameras in the fourth floor will be under my control. They will be in pause mode. How will it work? Section tech mechanism! If you take out your foot after stepping on it, the injection will jab you in a microsecond. He will get unconscious in one second... Five seconds to take him into the room. Two minutes to escape. We shall escape from room’s balcony after kidnapping Sohail. What if it fails? On which floor is the event? The event is for four hours. Sohail will use the washroom for at least once in four hours. We can capture Sohail if he uses the washroom. He will not get up for 6 hours due to sedation. But, there will be security with him always. We won’t capture him here. It’s in Ladies washroom. I won’t be executing that plan. It is you. Me? Where is the ventilator exit point? It is not a big deal. - Will our plan work out? - Hope so. Can you lift Sohail? He is walking towards the lift. He is getting into the lift. Uncle! This lift isn’t working. Use that lift. - Okay. Who are you? Security sir. Power problem, sir... It's been clear. Damn. Security report immediately on the 9th floor. I can’t see anything anymore. What’s happening, Arjun? Can you please tell me? Zubeda! Everything is collapsed... We missed him. Arjun! I am telling you again.... We are taking a big risk. You should stay alive to rescue your friends. We can rescue our friends only if we abduct Sohail. - Arjun. - We don’t have time. We have to execute the plan B. You have to go. Go! Okay. Zubeda... - Peace be upon you. Good! - And upon you too - How are you? - I'm doing great. Arjun. Yeah. He is going to the washroom. Go… Go fast. Go… Should enter gents wash room from ladies wash room through ventilator. Give him injection and pull him out. Go…Go! Get the convoy ready... Sir is going to leave in 10 minutes. Arjun. - Yeah. It's not happening. He is leaving the place in 10 minutes. You need to leave now! Welcome… To my Karachi. But, what is this Arjun? You are marshal under cover, 100 percent success rate… I heard a lot about you. But, you got caught easily without any planning. My plan is to get caught. Sohail! Karachi is your place. You know that there is this hotel here. Karachi knows that this hotel is in your control. But... Columns, beams, corridors in this construction… Rooms, fire exits, escape routes and all… I know it. I guess 20 kilos gelatin sticks will be enough for a blast. Single button! Your chapter close! Your father becomes heirless. Hey, Arjun! I leave you. Get out from here. Hey! I have the trigger... Shall I press it? Ask everyone to go out. Shall we go to the washroom? I thought Karachi would be blown in your absence. There is no such buzz. Where did you hide my friends? Tell me. Tell me! [WHISTLING] You can tell me whatever you feel. But, you have to ask Sohail if you need something. [LAUGHS] I am not Sohail. Sohail’s body-double! Arjun is only one if we get him. But, if he finds my body-double... All the agents supporting him in Karachi... and their safe house will be demolished. British general in the World War II and Hillary Clinton’s body-double during 911… Many world leaders had body-double. Now... I am the one for Sohail. Imagine me as Sohail and talk... Sohail will listen you. You didn't get it? I am connected to GPS. You're gone, baby. [LAUGHS] I want him alive. Bring him now! Go fast! Go that way. Arjun! They surrounded the place. [LAUGHS] This is your safe house. You know what to do. But, you? They came for me and they will follow me. Go…Go! Zubeda! Take it. Kill him guys! My bike! Let's go. Go there. - Peace be upon you. - And upon you, peace. What’s happening Sohail? You haven’t told me anything. Without saying anything or taking my permission, you open fired in a public place. Bilal Sir… Be patient. Our life is for the sake of Pakistan. Our death is for the sake of Pakistan. This should be the slogan… …of every Pakistani. Your speeches are good for crowd pulling at road show, Sohail. Pakistan is a country. You are not fit to say what it is in to the world. Go and fight alone. Then, you might understand. India is not infidel country but a country of bravery. It if was an infidel country, it would have been ours by now. Go and beg from America. Kid! Watch your words. Otherwise, ISI can give respect or affront you too. What will you do? Sohail! Brother... You know why I am worried... Within 12 hours... I will find him... and bring him to you. Hmm. Blackout, Karachi! - Go check upstairs. - Yes sir. - Sir. - You found him? There is no one here. - Hey! - Sir. Let's go. Even after getting shot twice... He didn’t go to any medical shop Someone in Karachi is helping him. Who is that? Whoa… This is my house. Don’t worry. I am alone here. You’ll be at risk if I stay here. It is much risky if you go out now. Do you know that? You want to what’s happening in Karachi? Death is waiting out there for you. I want my friends alive. I have to rescue them. Dad. RAW agent. We’ve been living in Pakistan for 35 years. Dad works as communications engineer. He died in a operation. I miss him. Do you miss someone? It's okay. Tell me only if you like to share. Hello. Hello. Arjun. I know that it is you. Arjun! Please talk. Arjun! I will not ask when or at what time you’ll come like other girlfriends I will not ask you to take me out for movies... All I need is a phone call and a selfie if possible. I just need that feeling of you missing me. Arjun. Arjun. With the sound of your breathe... I know how much you miss me. I love you, Arjun. “Like the beat of my heart” “Like a spark in my eyes” “All I need is you as a fulfilled dream” “Singing every moment” “With lovely words on my lips” “All I need is you as a fulfilled dream” “I am that playful wind twirling around you” “I will be your breathe" “Like the beat of my heart” “Like a spark in my eyes” “All I need is you as a fulfilled dream” “O’ my love…O’ my love” “O’ my love…O’ my love” “I don't want this desirous heaven” “I just want you to be in my dreams” “You are true meaning of happiness” “There is no other gift I wish except you” “My life belongs to you, dear” “My love is all for you, dear” “In the witness of all my lives” “Like the beat of my heart” “Like a spark in my eyes” “All I need is you as a fulfilled dream” “Singing every moment” “With lovely words on my lips” “All I need is you as a fulfilled dream” “I am that playful wind twirling around you” “I will breathe into your breath” “O’ my love…O’ my love” “O’ my love…O’ my love” Hello. Can you see me? Arjun! What happened? It’s surveillance camera near Gurbar bungalow. I know you can see me, Arjun. 130 cameras. That too in my Karachi without my knowledge. Wow! I must say… ISI should get trained from you. What an agent! Hats off to you, boss. You are in search of your friends like crazy. Is it? You want to see? Say Hello to your friends. You are not taking me seriously. No. - No! - No. Don’t hurt him… Hey… No... No... Hey! Hey… No! - Hey. - Hey! This is your last warning. Listen to me carefully. I will kill one guy for every step you take towards me. Will you still come? Come... I will record your death and make it viral on whatsapp. Get it? Is that video recorded? - Yes. - Play…Play... Rewind… Play again. Zoom... It is a Morse code. G8 summit is few days away… This is the building in Singapore where G8 summit will take place. There are 76 cameras outside. There are 120 cameras inside. This G8 summit will take place on 28th. We shall take those three guys to Singapore on 26th secretly. We’ll make sure that they are seen in every camera around this building. So, he will take those three in a private jet to G8 summit place. He will execute his plan with them. What plan? On 28th, these three guys will try to enter that building in a wheel chair. The security will stop them. At that time, we will detonate the bombs placed on their bodies. Boom! What will Pakistan get by doing that? India would say that it's Pakistan’s attack. But, Pakistan will prove it as India’s attack. How? After the world media announce them as Pakistanis, Pakistan will show proofs to inquiring committee that they are RAW agents. G8 countries would conclude it as India’s plan to spoil the reputation of Pakistan. No one will believe even if India shows evidence. I have to stop it… I have to stop it at any cost. Arjun is still alive. He should be alive, Bilal sir. After the G8 summit attack, We shall prove at G8 summit with a video that Arjun is here for a secret mission. We’ll hold RAW and Indian government and Arjun's team responsible for bombing Then, India will be struggling There is just one more day left for the summit. The entire Pakistan government supports Sohail. You have no one except me. How will you fight, Arjun? Zubeda! She gave us information that Abdul Salem is coming to Syria. You might need her help. Our agent runs a bouquet shop near FIA headquarters in Sardar area. You go and meet him. He will guide you to our location. They exposed me… But mission Chanakya is on. - Sir. - Your guess is right, Arjun. They are taking our agents in a private jet to Singapore at 11:30. I’m sure he is going to attack the summit. And he will blame India. I know we are in threat. but on the hotel where the delegates are residing. How can you be so sure? Ego... Sohail sent Abdul Salem to Syria… It is to get the information about our agents operating in Karachi... He tried to disturb G8 summit with our agents. We stopped it. That ego had him execute the same plan with our agents... All dots are now connected sir. Our strength and his weakness are... Sohail's ego. So... what shall we do now? Even though we know where our agents are kept and where they are heading. We cannot go beyond his security The airport is under ISI control. We have only one way left... We must rescue them while on their way to the airport. Hmm. The flight is at 11:30. So, he will move our agents at 10:30. When his cars cross the Wahab road circle, we will attack. We will rescue our agents after killing him before they find out what’s happening. I’ll activate all our agents in Karachi. They will shadow you in the mission. Thank you, sir. Arjun! A convoy is leaving from southwest building. I am on the way, sir. Sir, cam 7. God! Very intelligent! Arjun! A convoy came out from each of Qureshi’s seven houses. We have no idea where are agents are. Any convoy will end up at the airport, sir. They will converge at Wahab junction. Arjun! All the vehicles are converging towards Wahab junction just like you said. I can see them, sir. Bloody! All the vehicles are taking different routes. We are running out of time. The mission is gone, if we don’t find which vehicle has our agents. All convoys did not start at once, sir. There is a delay. Not only us, but also the drivers don’t know which route they might take. They are all getting instructions from Sohail. Krupa! Track the car from where Sohail is giving instructions. It is not important to know which vehicle gets instructions. It is important to know from where they get those instructions. If we can stop Sohail, the convoy will stop automatically. Get me bloody ears on the cars. Get into Masjid road. Take a right turn immediately. Arjun! Every car is getting instructions from one place. Sohail is instructing them. Seven kilometers to your west! There is nothing here, sir. Instructions are coming from that place. He must have rerouted the communications. That rogue is somewhere else. He’s diverting to eat our time. Arjun! Our agents reached the airport. Hurry up. We don’t have time. What the hell is it? Sir! He is here. Karachi Jinnah International Airport Arjun… Our agents were already boarded into the flight. He’s using the tunnel, sir. A small change in the plan, dad! The bomb blast is not at the G8 summit place. What? There will be a blast in the hotel where the delegates reside. 180 delegates! 3 bombs! Sohail? What happened? Nothing. Dad! I will call you back. The flight is on the runway already. - Yeah, Sohail. - Arjun! Put on Facetime. [GRUNTS] Arjun! - Ask them to stop the flight. - No, dad. No! Sohail will be dead if the flight doesn’t stop. Call the flight back.... Time is running up. Damn it! Okay. Relax. Chief! Stop the flight. No. I can’t do that. I said, stop the flight. - Not possible. - Stop the flight! Flight 317 land immediately. Land immediately... It's emergency. What do you want? It takes two hours to reach Indian check post 45 from the airport. Come there along with my friends. I will entrust Sohail to you. Your time starts now. Qureshi Bhai! We’ve been waiting since three months for this mission. This is all about Pakistan’s honor. It's my son's life! Let me get Sohail back. I will show him… who I am. Where is Sohail? Where is my son? Sohail? No! No! No…! Sohail…! I didn't give you 2 hours time to reach here from Karachi... It takes 2 hours to take your son to India from here. Are you wondering how I did this in spite of having blacking out of Karachi? After all, terrorists like you cross the borders and come to India. This is Indian Army. A single signal is enough. It can change the Pakistan’s border. I’ll kill you. I will kill you! I will kill you! Shoot me. I came to Karachi to lure you out. The one who doesn’t fear death is not afraid of bullets, Qureshi. Arjun! This is your phone. It is your son, Sohail. Pick it up. Sohail…? Are you fine, my son? Peace be upon you, Qureshi. Do you recognize me? Kulkarni. Oh! Thanks… For remembering me. - Don’t you dare do something to my son! - Qureshi! We didn't hand over your son to the government custody. He is still in our custody. Unless I give orders, Your son will not move from here. You have to take a call. It is the deal. Your son will not come to you unless we cross the border. Why did you take such risk for India that gave Shoot-at-sight orders on you? You will not understand. Because... You came to Pakistan for survival... I came to Pakistan to protect India even if it costs my life. There is no one who went back to India from Karachi after messing up with me. Everything has a beginning, Qureshi. Sohail… Are you fine? Are you okay, my son? Sohail. He is not Sohail. Hey! Where is Sohail? Where is Sohail? Arjun! Qureshi! You planned to capture me using body double. I used the same body double to bring your son to India. I shoot him below fifth rib on right side. He is unconscious. It will take half an hour for him to wake up. Take him immediately... You know what to do. By the way, what is your punch line? Expect the unexpected? Until my son reaches me... India won’t be at peace. I won’t make it that hard for you. Pakistan will entrust you to India after G8 summit tomorrow. I’ll see you soon. Come. He is so cute. So sweet! Hi. He looks just like you. Those eyes and nose! See... He looks exactly like Aadhi. Hey, dear. Sorry. He didn’t die in a bike or car accident while driving irresponsibly. He didn’t fight for caste or religion. He sacrificed his life for this country. My dear brothers and sisters... Keeping Indian cops in mind... G8 countries have decided to hand over Qureshi to India. Good job, Arjun. Sorry sir... There is small portion pending in the mission. What's that? How do you know that he is the mole? RAW, sir!
