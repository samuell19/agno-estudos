No! (unsettling music) (wind howling) (unsettling music) (car horn honking) (eerie music) (bird chirping) Rocky, your coffee's ready! Judy, you don't forget now. You come home with your brother. Okie dokie. Again? (fizzling) But I don't have a hangover, damn it. Well then go see a doctor, honey. [Woman] Have a seat, Mr. Foscoe, and make yourself comfortable. The doctor will be with you in a moment to discuss the results of your tests. Relative to these radiographs, Mr. Foscoe, there seems to be some abnormalities. We'll need further testing. But doc, what about this dream I had last night? It seems so real. (ominous music) Okay, let's hear it again Mr. Foscoe. Well, yesterday I took the long way home. (eerie music) I remembered stopping the car on Old Orchard Road. (ominous music) You know, I must have dozed, because when I woke up I had this awful headache. God, when I got out of the car. Well, doc, what I'm trying to say is my car was up in the sky. Rocky, you've got to lay off the booze. Now look, I'll write out a prescription for those headaches of yours. Be sure to see Sharon about an appointment for those followup tests, okay? Whatever you say, doc. Fine, thank you. There you are, Mr. Foscoe. We'll send you your bill. Oh, Mr. Foscoe. Can I make another appointment for you next Thursday? Oh yeah, same time. ♫ It only happens once a year ♫ [Radio Announcer] Yes, here is the announcement you've been waiting for about the great sale that occurs only once a year. Don't miss it. (upbeat radio music) ♫ My love has gone away ♫ Think I'm gonna die ♫ My live is gone away ♫ Think I'm gonna die ♫ Your hair looks great like this. Thank you. (knocking) Oh, hi! Good morning, ma'am. Good morning! How's the young grandson today? Oh, fine. Good, I see we don't have to wait today. Oh no. Hop up here, young fella. Listen, I'd like you to take a little more off this time. Especially around those ears. That reminds me, my dog got itching ears. Every time she would scratch herself she's howling and she's squeal. So you know what? No. I decided to take her to the vet. [Rocky] I see. Instead of him fixing her itchy ears, he told me to go home and get a pile of her stool. Of course, we call it number two. I couldn't imagine what it has to do with itching ears, so I went home. Not to get the number two. Instead, I call the veteran's hospital and they tell me, "We treat people here, not dogs." And that I should call the vet hospital. But I said this is the vet hospital, isn't it? You know, he hung up on me? (rumbling) (ominous music) (metal clinking) Hey, what's with you, mister? I gotta leave now. (ominous music) Last time we're coming o this barber shop. I've never seen anything like it in my life. Look at that hair. He didn't even finish cutting it. (intense music) Car trouble, mister? Huh? No. You live around here? Yeah, right over there. Moved out here after the wife died for some peace and quiet. You know something? There be some mighty weird things been happening around here. (unsettling music) (water pouring) There. Hey listen, old timer. What did you mean, "weird?" Well, mister, last night, when me and the dog was about to turn in... Hey, drink up your coffee. Relax. (chuckling) Well, anyway, (eerie music) I heard this rumbling sound. Of course I thought it was gonna rain and then it sounded as if someone was hollering or screaming. Now this will sound crazy, but I swear it was coming from the roof of this house. So I got my scatter gun and went out to see. (ominous music) But then it seemed like the hollering and screaming was coming from the top of the trees. From the very sky. (man yelling) Maybe the Lord just wanted to show his wrath at us. I don't know. What's wrong, mister? Ain't you feeling well? (ominous music) You want some more coffee? No. Come on, it's my home brew. (rumbling) I said no! (intense music) No! No! (banging) (dog whimpering) (car engine rumbling) (eerie music) (camera clicking) That's fine, Michael, thank you. Doctor, this gun has been fired. Like I told you, O'Brien. As far as I can tell, no bullet has entered this body. Quite frankly, I don't see a peace shooter doing this. Well then, I wonder what did happen. (chuckling) That's your department. But I can tell you this. This man has only been dead for about five hours. (police radio buzzing) Stand by. Three, Two. One. Cue Joyce. In this remote farmhouse, just off Old Orchard Road, a bizarre killing was discovered early this afternoon. Oh, officer. This is Lt. Walter O'Brien investigating officer for this most unusual case. Lieutenant, can you give us an explanation? I have no comments at this time, ma'am. Surely you must have some idea. Look, lady, I said I have no statement. What the hell are you doing here anyway? Hey, lieutenant! What you got? Well, O'Brien, I think you should take a look at this. Uh huh. O'Brien, these tracks match the ones we found up near the farmhouse. What's puzzling is these tracks just end. (eerie music) What the hell? This whole case is crazy. How did he get the car back up on the road? What's that? This? I don't know. It's some kind of jacket. We found it laying up by the other tire tracks. Run it through the lab anyway. Will do. (somber music) (unsettling music) Goodnight, doctor. Goodnight, dear. (sighing) (ominous music) (eerie music) (eerie music) Yes, is this the police? The identification of the deceased is being withheld pending notification of next of kin. A bizarre killing so unexpected, so out of place, in an area as serin as this. The police have no firm clues at this time. This is Joyce Roberts for TV 3. No firm clues? No firm clues? You were out there all afternoon. Did you say that? Chief, I didn't say a thing. Who the hell did? (phone ringing) Detective division, Officer Carr speaking. That would be Lt. Walter O'Brien. No, I'm sorry, he's in conference. Hold on, please. I want this clearly understood. If anybody's gonna talk to the press it's gonna be me. Now pass that down to your cronies. (phone buzzing) What? You. Yes? Excuse me, Lieutenant, there's a Dr. Steinberg on the phone who things he knows something about the Old Orchard case. Okay, I better take it now. Don't you forget, O'Brien. Get your asses in gear. (door slamming) Hey O'Brien, here's that lab report on the jacket we found. Yes? Speaking. Who? Could you spell that? Uh huh. Address? Harvey and Madison? Thank you. Doctor, could we talk tonight? Thank you, I'll be right over, doctor. Lab report. Thank you, Jack. (wind whooshing) (thudding) Sharon? (thudding) Sharon? Is that you? (menacing music) It's you. What do you want at this hour, Mr. Foscoe? Doctor, I need your help. Well, I was just leaving. Why don't you call for an appointment in the morning? You know this isn't really the proper time for you to be here. I just couldn't wait. You see, doc, I had this accident. Oh, I see. (eerie music) That looks like a... It's nothing serious. How did that happen? Well, I'll get something for it. Why don't you take your shirt off and make yourself comfortable? I'll be with you in a second. Look, doc., that's not why I really came here. I've gotten into some real-- We'll talk. We'll talk. Just relax. (unsettling music) (foreboding music) (typewriter clicking) (phone ringing) Jackson speaking, can I help you? No. No, he's already left. Well, when did he leave? (ominous music) (doorknob clicking) No. Oh, sure, sure. Then he is coming? (door creaking) (ominous music) What? Powder burns? (ominous music) All right, all right, doctor. The lieutenant will be there shortly. (menacing music) Thank you very much. (intense music) (gagging) (screaming) (thudding) (ominous music) (car engine starting) (tires screeching) (foreboding music) Call Central and tell them to radio O'Brien and tell him I'm going to be following him in. We need a backup too. We'll be at, what is that? Madison and Harvey. (foreboding music) [Female Dispatcher] This is Central. Lieutenant O'Brien, code 108, acknowledge. This is Central. Lieutenant O'Brien, code 108, acknowledge. This is O'Brien, 10-4. [Female Dispatcher] Lieutenant, Sargent Jackson is proceeding to your location with backup. Okay, Central. 10-4. You better tell them to send an ambulance, but there's no hurry. Out. [Female Dispatcher] 10-4. (foreboding music) (eerie music) (eerie music) O'Brien, you in there? My God. What a mess. I knew something happened but I didn't think it was anything like this. What do you mean? I was talking to this dude on the phone and all of a sudden all hell broke loose. What exactly did he say? He wanted to talk to you. Then he mentioned something about a powder burn. - Jack. - [Jackson] Yeah? Would you clean up this mess a little? I've got to run. I've got to go. Okay. Hey, Bob? (exciting disco music) (bar commotion) Hi, how are you? (exciting disco music) Let's drink to that. (exciting disco music) Oh, there you are. Where you been? Hey, you got your head in the clouds? What did you mean by that? What? What the hell has come over you? I've been looking for you all day today. I had to lock up the shop and then you left the lights on. I've been making excused to your customers. [Man] Hey, Cathy! Come on over here. You're hopeless, Rocky. Hey. There is something wrong, isn't there? You want a drink? Are you all right? Come on, babe, let's get out of here. (exciting disco music) (people laughing) (somber guitar music) God, I wish we could always be together. (match fizzling) Rocky, you know how I feel about you. But I just can't go on like this. Well, damn it, Cathy, what do you want me to do? I got two kids. (sighing) I know. What's the difference anyway? What's with you? I don't know. I hope things will change. (somber music) (birds chirping) (doorbell ringing) Who is it? I'm Lt. Walter O'Brien, madame. County Sheriff's Department. I'd like to speak to Mr. Foscoe, please. Do you realize it's only seven in the morning? I know, madame, I'm sorry. You see, it's very important. Well he ain't home. I see. Would you be expecting him home soon? I don't know nothing. Sometimes he's home, sometimes he ain't. All right, madame, I'll call back later. What's wrong? Has something happened? No, madame, it's just a routine call. All right, students, that should do it for today. Follow through with your assignments for tomorrow. Oh, Nancy, don't forget to reread chapter five. Yes, doctor. Professor? Lt. Walter O'Brien. We spoke last night on the telephone. Oh yes, yes, I recall. Well, what can I do for you? I don't mean to take up too much of your time, professor. I was wondering if you could expand a little on our previous conversation. Sir, discussing subjects of an abstract nature could become embarrassing for a man in my position. I am a scientist. But I thought that you were an expert in the field of parapsychology? You want me to commit myself to a statement as to whether a person has the power to overcome the laws of gravity and even suspend themselves upwards in midair without any inertial force? (chuckling) Professor, all I want are the facts. Only theories exist in the studies of parapsychology. Well then, could you tell me your theory concerning this case? Sir, the Russians have established a premise in this field. It's called Psychotronic Energy. (eerie music) Could you be more explicit, sir? You must understand, the subconscious mindis an untapped reservoir of acquired information. In fact, some parapsycholists believe that in rare cases this submerged power will surface. But do you believe in this Psychotronic energy? Yes or no? (eerie music) (children hollering) (burping) Anything happening, Jackson? (burping) Want a bite? (groaning) Suit yourself. [O'Brien] This is 15. Yo, O'Brien, this is Maloney. Give me that. O'Brien, no sign of him yet. Just the kids coming in and out. [O'Brien] 10-4, guys. I'm coming in with a warrant. I swear, if he's in there, we'll nail him. That's a roger, 10-4. [O'Brien] 10-4. (Maloney sighing) How long have they been out there? They came this morning. Hey, why didn't you tell me they were here? Because you were passed out drunk. There was no way anyone or anything coulda woke you up. You slept all day. Nevermind. What are you doing? Rocky, where do you think you're going? Will you answer me? I gotta get away from here. And fast! Give me some cash. Will you at least tell me what's happening? What's wrong? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Has it got something to do with that broad you've been seeing? I haven't got time to explain. And why not? Get off of me! (eerie music) (screaming) From in there! (woman screaming) (tires screeching) (intense music) (tires screeching) (siren alarming) Pursuing assailant east on 15th and need intercept at 90. Over. This is car 67 responding. Has he already made it to the expressway? [O'Brien] 10-4. (police sirens alarming) (exciting music) (police sirens alarming) (exciting music) (car engine starting) (police sire alarming) Car 42, O'Brien? [O'Brien] Roger, Jack. Yeah, O'Brien. That woman's okay. A little bit frightened. I'm gonna be following you up on 90. You come down from the north. We're coming up from the south side on the S. We're staying close. He looks as if he's gonna go into traffic. [Jackson] 10-4. (exciting music) (police sire alarming) (intense music) Car 735 to central! Car 735 to central! Central, where are our backup units? Try to get our backup units. This guys drives like a Chicago cab driver. (laughing) (intense music) (police sirens alarming) We're coming up to Morgan Street, Lieutenant. Are you coming up here? [O'Brien] You have suspect in sight? Yeah, he's right in front of us and he's changing lanes. He cutting all over into traffic. We're trying to keep up with him. If you can come up on the right. [O'Brien] I will overtake you in about one mile. I see your lights no win the back, Lieutenant. Come on up here. I estimate the suspect must be doing at least 75 miles per hour. I am speeding up. I have him in sight and closing rapidly. All units responding to cod 1-4-2. Red units use frequency 1-7. Blue units use frequency 1-4. (exciting music) (police sirens alarming) (police sirens alarming) (exciting music) Jack, follow us down to lower Wacker. 10-4, Lieutenant, I'll be right behind you. (exciting music) (intense music) All right, boys, pull back a bit and let me have him. We've got him now. (intense music) (eerie music) Theory, my eye. (police sirens alarming) This is car 42. O'Brien, I'm on him. (intense music) (police sirens alarming) (thudding) (tires screeching) (crashing) (booming) (police sirens alarming) (menacing music) (exciting drum music) (police sirens alarming) Freeze! (gunshots booming) (exciting music) (police sirens alarming) (booming) (ominous music) (footsteps scuffing) (ominous music) (unsettling music) (menacing music) (buzzing) (intense music) (police hollering) (gunshot popping) (train crossing bell ringing) (train honking) (gunshot popping) (train rumbling) (booming) Hey, wait a minute! Stop! (buzzing) (ominous music) (police sirens alarming) Wait a minute! Wait a minute! He's going all the way to the top. (ominous music) Okay, to the roof. (menacing music) (gunshots booming) Freeze! (ominous music) (rumbling) (pulsing) (men screaming) (electrical buzzing) (groaning) God! Hey, you guys okay? I'm all right. (eerie music) Jack! Bob! Harry! Fan out, lads. Behind me. (eerie music) (wind howling) [Police Radio Dispatcher] Do you request backup? All right, backup is one the way. Estimated time of arrival, two minutes. (eerie music) (wind howling) There's no sign of him. [Radio Cop] We have the building roped off. He's not getting out of there. Hey, give me that. Thanks. Jack. Yeah? Lieutenant, it's clear down here. Regroup the men at this area. Okay. But why, O'Brien? He's not here. Don't argue and radio for a SWAT team and long-range rifles. Anything you say. This is Jackson. Can I get a SWAT team? (eerie music) (wind howling) (military drumming music) (ominous music) Captain? Yes, Lieutenant? I have a man up on that roof and I want him hit. Is he armed? He doesn't need to be. (foreboding music) You got anything on that damn squawk box yet? I don't know what's going on here? Lieutenant O'Brien? Yes. Gorman, special intelligence agent. Can I speak to you privately? Certainly. Over here. Lieutenant, what are your intentions of capturing Mr. Foscoe? Are you familiar with the details of this case? Let's put it this way. We've had him under surveillance. (ominous music) Make certain no harm comes to him. When he is captured, he'll be placed in my custody. What? Do you realize this man is responsible for the murders of three people? (intense music) (gun clicking) For your information, Lieutenant, this guy's a rare breed. Probably the only one of his kind in this hemisphere. Our intelligence reports confirmed that he possesses psychotronic powers that can well benefit our national security. (ominous music) At what price? Enough. I've got my orders. I just gave you yours. (foreboding music) Captain, don't miss. (military drumming) [Megaphone Announcer] Attention, Foscoe! I repeat, attention! This is the county sheriff. You are hereby ordered to surrender yourself immediately. We have this roof surrounded. You can not escape. Foscoe, this is your last warning. I repeat, this is your last warning. (drum rolling) (intense music) (gun clicking) (drum rolling) (booming) (screaming) (ominous music) (wind howling) 10-4. Damn, Lieutenant. He's not down there. You guys got any more word on what's going on down there? [Radio Cop] We don't see him down here either, sergeant. We're looking and we don't see him. [Jackson] Damn it,look for him. Find him. (foreboding music) [Radio Cop] So far, we can't find him. [Jackson] Well if they saw him fall, he's down there. Find him. (foreboding music) (rumbling) (dramatic music)
