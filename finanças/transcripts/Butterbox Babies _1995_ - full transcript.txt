(gentle music) (baby crying) - She looks strong and healthy, Vivian. Now, come on, Iris. Help me clean up. (children laughing) You can go in and see your mom now. Jimmy, you got another girl. - Thank God you got here, Lila. Doc Kennedy said there'd be no way this baby would come on so quick. - Well, I guess your wife knows better to listen to her own body than Doc Kennedy. - [Jimmy] Well, speak of the devil. (horn honking) - Time for us to go, Iris. (solemn music) (gravel crunching) You're a bit late, Doctor. Mother and child are fine. - What in God's name are you doin', Lila Young? - Why, the intended for me, Doctor, delivering babies. (engine revving) (horn honks) (solemn music) - Did ya see the look he gave ya? - Doctors don't walk on water, Iris. They wash in it like the rest of us. (Iris chuckles) (gentle music) Huh. There's one of mine. (horn honking) - That old man's her father? - No, he adopted her. (sighs) Their life isn't all that easy. Still, any home's better than no home at all. - You think I'm doin' right, givin' mine up? - Iris, you keep that child you'll pay for the rest of your life. Your own father beat ya and threw ya out. You think the rest of the world will be any different? Give yourself another chance. (gentle music) (Lila sighs) You Dorothy? Dr. Young. I'll get it. (gentle music) (engine rumbling) - I see you got another one. - [Lila] Can you put that on our account, Hank? - How many you got out there these days? - 20. - I guess your account will hold then. Nice to see somebody making a go of something around here. Let me put these in the car for you. (gentle music) (engine rumbling) (solemn music) - Hey, Iris, go get Peter to help you with the groceries. Come on, Dorothy. Thank you. Easy now. There you go. Be right with ya. (baby crying) Outta respect for my girl's privacy, they all get new names and I'm puttin' you down as Daisy. It's $150 for delivery, adoption, room and board and $12 for baby clothes and layette. If it's too hard on you now, you can stay on after and work off your debt in childcare and housekeeping. Just pay what you can for now. You're perfectly safe here. We'll never kick ya out just as long as you're pull your weight and follow the rules. All the girls are expected to help with the chores. Sign the second page. - [Boy] Come on, give it to me. - Yeah right. - Run on inside you two and blow the stink off of ya, come on. Oh, you come with me. - [Girl] I wanna go out and play with them. - My own brood of three. Fern? Will you look after Daisy here? Give her the daily routine and add her name to the chore list. (Lila smooching) (Lila sighs) (children chattering) - Daniel! - Here's my better half. Lila, Nurse O'Dwyer. - [Lila and Ann] Hello. - I've been so looking forward to this interview. Here are extra copies of my references, Dr. Young. - Why don't you two get acquainted? - I prefer we keep our business outta doors. - Are all the patients here maternity cases? - Yeah (chuckles). We didn't plan on it when we opened this sanitarium, but the Lord has given us the task of refuging these poor girls. They have nowhere else to go. - I see. You must get some pathetic cases. - I deliver the girls their babies and give them back their dignity. I don't pass judgment. - I don't think badly of your girls, Mrs. Young. Everybody deserves a second chance in my books. And you assist Dr. Young with all the deliveries do you? - When needed, Will assists me. My husband is a chiropractic physician. I am the obstetrician. Graduated from the School of Obstetrics and Midwifery in Chicago. - I didn't mean to offend. I've never assisted a midwife before, but I have great respect for what you do. - Oh, well, so you should. Women have been delivering babies for thousands of years. - Do you have a doctor on call? - We have a doctor we can call if he deigns to come. - Well, most doctors don't give a hoot about a girl's plight anyway, I know that. - (sighs) Truth is it's the Minister of Health forcing us to take on a nurse we can ill afford. I can use someone for deliveries and to work a few regular days a week. - Look, I'm in no position to turn down anything you can offer Mrs. Young. - A job's a job, is it? - I didn't mean that either. I'm a good nurse. I do what I'm told. Give me a chance. - My husband and I are Seventh Day Adventists. We don't allow tobacco or any other stimulants on the premises. - The new girls' water just broke! She's havin' it in the middle of the hall! - You can start now if you like! (Dorothy/Daisy screaming) - Shh. It's all right, you're all right. Shh. You're all right. It's all right. It's all right, Daisy. Shh, it's all right. (Dorothy/Daisy sobbing) God keep you, little one. (Dorothy/Daisy sobbing) Oh. It's all over now. It came before it's time. It's not your fault. (Dorothy/Daisy sobs softly) (pensive music) (liquid splashing) - I need a breakfast tray for Daisy, Mrs. McPhee. - Oh, we're doin' room service now are we? - She can't move. The poor girl has to eat. - I'll do it for ya. - Thank you. - Thanks, Iris. (pensive music) - Sneakin' a peek at your girlfriend, Petey? He figures a girl fell once, she'll fall again. - A butterbox? - It's a perfectly good pine box. Put a wiggle into that breakfast tray and come back quick. We gotta get the wee bastards fed. (solemn music) - Should I notify the authorities? (Lila smirks) - Last time we did that the poor thing rotted in our shed, what, three weeks before those clowns in Public Health issued a burial certificate? No. The girl's suffered enough. We don't need the government standing by to enumerate their sins. - I suppose. If they had their way, they'd try and outlaw all illegitimate birds period. - "Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for such is the kingdom of heaven. And he took them up into his arms and laid his hand upon them and blessed them." Amen. - Amen. (solemn music) Sometimes I think the lucky ones are those that go straight back to God's arms. - Oh, whether your time's too short or your time's too long, there are no days of heaven here on Earth. - Oh, I wish that blasted Frank Davis would leave us alone. - (chuckles) If wishes were nickels, our place would be somethin' wouldn't it? - I got a call from the local register in Chester. Apparently Davis wants to improve our paperwork and his statistics or so they made the excuse. - [Will] Things will be different once we have church sanction. - Oh yes, that'll certainly shake up Frank Davis and the rest of those meddlers over at the Ministry of Health, eh? - "I gladly baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of Holy Ghost." Amen. - [All] Amen. - [Woman] Praise Him. (water splashing) - "As the Lord forgave Mary Magdalene, so shall your sins be washed away." (water splashing) - Come on (groans). There you go. - Right? - Yeah. (sighs) Thank you, Reverend Beggs. - With his lay experience, William could do this on his own. - Oh, we're glad to have you here. - Yeah, for more reason than this. We received rather disappointing news. The church has informed us it is not prepared to sponsor our sanitarium as a charitable organization. - Well, don't these women pay fees? (Lila exhales) - We don't want to charge the girls. Most of them can't pay anyway. Reverend, we could have a mission here just like Battle Creek. We could, but without church endorsement, we can't carry out our good work. We badly need donations. - Oh, there are enough draws on the church's purse. You'll do fine. It's hard, but some of these girls need hard lessons. - These girls are not sinners. - Forgive us, Lord, but we are all sinners. You can have a tidy little business here, if you tighten your own purse and watch your bottom line. Be thankful of that. (solemn music) - That's the best piece of advice we'll ever get. - Well, we're all doing God's bidding. - He wouldn't know God's bidding if it came up and bit him in the ass. (Will laughs) - Come on, Daisy. Dr. Young'll have our heads on a platter if we're not downstairs. (Dorothy/Daisy sobbing) - Iris, there's a pile of laundry mile high, needs folding in the kitchen. (solemn music) (Dorothy/Daisy sobs) Well, what's all this about? Hm? - Don't make me stay here. I wanna go home (sobbing). - We'll see what we can do about it, hm? That's a good girl, now. (seagulls squawking) (boat horn blaring) - He said he'd be straight over. - Good. - Lila, I don't know about this. - The girl has to go home, Will, and somebody has to pay. It's the only way to see justice done. - He'll have his date with God. - First he has a date with me. (Will sighs) Mr. Macdonald? - What's this all about? - Would you please get in the car so we could have a little talk? (boat horn blaring) You do remember Miss Thomas? - Oh. Hi there, you. - So you do recall meeting at a dance in Saint John? - Yeah, sure. Dorothy, right? So, how ya been? (engine rumbling) (pensive music) I'm a married man, I got two kids. - Should've thought of that before you destroyed the life of this young girl here. - Look, I'm awful sorry. - Sorry? Sorry isn't gonna pay the $150 it takes to feed and clothe your baby 'til it's adopted. - But I don't have it! - Then borrow it. - Would you ruin my family for a lousy 150 bucks? - Would you? - All right. But it won't be paid in nothin' more than installments. (pensive music) (children chattering) (solemn music) - He has the right to know the baby's dead and buried doesn't he? - No. Then he'd leave ya high and dry for certain. Be glad ya can put all this behind ya and get on with your life. The Lord accepts just cause and that man deserves to pay. (solemn music) - [Receptionist] There's a Dr. Kennedy to see you, Dr. Davis. - Pat, good to see you. What brings you into town? - Frank, I know you're a busy man. - Oh, nonsense. I was just thinking about you. Sit down. - Oh. - I just appointed a bright, young graduate social worker to look after Public Health in your district. - And this Lila Young bullshit I hope? - Well, I understand the Young's have complied with our order and hired a registered nurse. - So what? That woman has advertised in the newspapers for those sluts to come and camp out in her own backyard. They've hoodwinked half the county into thinkin' that they're doctors. Why, even some of my own patients, married women are goin' to her now. - Pat, why don't you try working with her? - Oh (chuckles), the only time she ever calls me is when she wants somebody to go in there and clean up her mess. You know the rumors. Dumpin' dead infants from fishing boats into the sea and God knows where else. - On the surface, there is nothing irregular about the way things are run. - Listen, you look beneath the surface. How do ya think that witch doctor is treatin' infections, eh? And smallpox and whoopin' cough and the common cold for God's sake? Infant mortality is bad enough in the best hospitals in this city. How many babies do you think are dyin' in a dump like that? - Not according to our records. - Oh, your records mean jack squat out there and ya know it. They're breakin' the law. Step up your inspections. - These folk got a 10 cent business in an area where there is little else. - Maybe you'd see a different if the 10 cents was comin' out of your own pocket. - Fine, I'll call a registrar in Chester and I'll have him deny them anymore death certificates until the R.C.M.P. have investigated each case. Will that make ya happy? - No, shut her down, or face the consequences come election time. (solemn music) (door slams) (solemn music) (Russell knocking) (Russell's throat clears) - Good afternoon. I'm Russell Cameron from Public Health. I'm here to inspect the premises. - [Iris] Just a moment, I'll get Dr. Young. - What's this all about? Another make work project from the Minister of Health? - [Russell] (chuckles) I just happened to be in the area. - Oh, I have no doubt of that. - Well, I'd like to see the nursery please, since I'm here. Mrs. Young I presume? - Don't presume anything, young man. Follow me. I don't have all blessed day. The Lord has certainly cut out our workforce. Thank you, Violet. (baby babbling) As you can see, it's clean. - Who watches them all? This one nurse? - Nurse O'Dwyer, myself and the others see that they're fed and changed. - And do you ever take them outside? - [Lila] Of course. - Let them out of their cribs? - Yes, of course. But babies need quiet time, too. The only way to care for this number of infants is to keep to a strict routine, which Mr. Cameron, I would like to get back to. Thank you, Nurse. - [Russell] Have you had any recent fatalities? - Only the stillborns. - You are under Ministry obligation to register any death. - And I'm happy to comply if the infant is full term and not a miscarriage. (pensive music) (door slams) - [Russell] That's not our intention. Mrs. Young, we are simply trying to- - [Lila] Dr. Young. - (sighs) We are simply trying to ensure that these young women and their infants are receiving satisfactory care, that's all. - You go back and tell the honorable Minister of Health that if he cared at all about these young women, his government wouldn't treat them like common criminals. - I don't think it's his intention- - He spends our taxes on the likes of those grim institutions that condemn the girls as sinners. Whereas homes like mine that are doing God's bidding, defending the girls from malicious gossip in the spirit of Christian forgiveness, go without. - Look, I'm not trying to criticize you, but let's you and I get something straight. I'm trying to make a fair and a thorough- - You're trying to do the bully work of Dr. Frank Davis and a lot of lily-livered doctors that can't seem to bear honest competition. Have a pleasant drive back to Halifax, Mr. Cameron. - Thank you, I will. - [Lila] God bless you. (door slams) (pensive music) (lighter flicks) (pensive music) - Look, Frank, you hired me to bring in new reforms. Well, I'm telling you that this place sticks out like a sore thumb. I think the billing system that they've got in place over there, frankly, I think that it lends itself to abuses. What she's charging those girls up front, it's outrageous. - Why the hell shouldn't they pay? They got themselves into trouble. - So why, what? So what is that supposed to mean? That the Young's should be able to do what they bloody well please with them? Look, with an upfront payment system it is an incentive to move these girls in and out as quickly as possible. And in fact, the faster they do, the more money they make. I mean, even on something like a daily rate, these girls would have a much better chance of receiving proper care. - I sent you out there to do a routine inspection, not to go off on some bloody crusade. Now, are the babies healthy? - What? I don't know. I'm a social worker, Frank. You're the doctor. What, don't you have proper medical staff in there? Check up on the place? - Well, surely you would be able to notice if there were any signs of contagious infection. - See, the thing is nobody acts the way that she did unless they've got something to hide. - Well, where's the proof? - Look, all I know is I don't trust the woman as far as I can throw her. She's got religion oozing out of every gland in her body. It's enough to make you sick. (Frank chuckles) - Try to see it her way. She's had this business going for what? 10 years without any interference. - Lila Young hasn't a single kind word to say about you. - The woman is an ignorant harridan no doubt. But she does have friends in the community and I'm in the business of protecting votes. (Russell chuckles) - Look, unless we can license and regulate that place it is gonna be a flagship for every other private maternity home in this province to extort money for substandard care. - Change takes time. - Change- - And we're dealin' with public opinion here. And frankly, the public doesn't care what happens to these girls. So, just write up your reforms and then talk to me. (baby whimpering) (gentle music) - Ann, can I hold her? - Well, just for a minute. (baby gurgling) (gentle music) - I wonder if my mother ever held me like this. - Sure she did. - I hardly remember her. Dad brought us up. - Nurse O'Dwyer, I said to take that baby up to the nursery. - No, I wanna hold her just for a little. - No, Iris. You know the baby - Please, let me. - has to go upstairs. - No, no, let go. - Just leave her. Please. - Let her go. - Please, let me. Just leave her, please. - Iris, Iris, Iris, - I wanna hold her. - calm yourself. We've talked - I know, I want her. - about this before. Now, it's for your own good. - I know (sobbing). - Aw, don't get yourself upset. (Iris sobbing) (solemn music) - Just there, Sir. (pensive music) (Virginia laughs) - There she is. - There's just the matter of the girl's expenses so we can let her go home to her folks. - Why don't we go and show the Senator his new granddaughter. (Virginia chuckles) (baby whimpering) Senator, it's such an honor having you at our home and meeting you finally. - You've made my son and daughter-in-law very happy. - Young lady, if you have any problems or questions, don't be a stranger. - [Senator] Let's get my granddaughter home, shall we? - Thanks so much, Dr. Young. - We really are very, very grateful. - Good luck. - Thank you. (solemn music) - [David] Let's go. (engine rumbling) (solemn music) - They've cleared your bill. You can go home now. - I wish I could find a home half so good for all the babies born here. Oh, Iris. Your little girl will want for nothing in this life. Hm? Why don't you get the boys and bring 'em in for supper? (solemn music) (Iris exhales) (door latches) (carriage rattling) (pensive music) - Whoa, whoa. ♪ On the dawn ♪ You wait here. ♪ The river ♪ ♪ The beautiful, the beautiful river ♪ ♪ Gather with the saints of the river ♪ I sent a cable. - Oh, well please come in. - Come in Mr. Lang, close the door and sit down. Are you the father of this girl's baby? - I suppose so. - Put the cigarette out. My husband and I run this sanitarium in accordance with our beliefs. No tobacco or other stimulants on the premises. Does the girl have family? - Up by Seaforth. They ain't about to interfere. I'm the one that cares about Eva. - Not so much as to marry her. - Things ain't always so easy. - Things never are. - It's such a- - Eva? Eva? - She's deaf. - We're going to call you Rose to protect your privacy. Do you understand? - Rose? - And we're gonna take care of you and your baby. Good. (solemn music) (carriage rattling) (Eva/Rose gasping) - Don't give up on us, do you understand me, Rose? - If you can't keep her still we'll have to tie her down. - God, please! Take me! I'm good! - He knows you're good, but you gotta keep on trying. Now, come on, Rose, try. Push! - God, please (groaning)! - I need fundal pressure. (suspenseful music) (Eva/Rose gasping) - Should I prepare more ether? - No, she's no use to me if she's too far gone. - You're okay, Rose. You're doing okay. - Oh, good Lord! - What is it? - What's her pulse? (suspenseful music) I'm worried that placenta is separated already. - Thready and faint. 130. She's going into shock. - We gotta get that baby outta there. (Lila groans) - Can I help? - No! - Missus- - Iris, get out. (suspenseful music) - Lila? - Don't let her get the others upset. What's her pressure? - 60 over 40. - Should I call Doc Kennedy? - Prepare the ether. - Lila, what are you doing? We can't handle this alone. We need help. We've got to call her doctor. - No time. (pensive music) - We're gonna lose 'em both. (suspenseful music) Come on, Rose, listen to me. What do you think you're doing? - We have to look to the girl. More ether. Put her right out. - Lila, you can't. - I said put her out. (suspenseful music) (Ann panting) (crickets chirping) - Ann? - Let her go. - Apparently the girl's parents don't live anywhere near a phone or a Telegraph, but I managed to get in touch with the baby's father. (crickets chirping) Are you all right? (solemn music) (Ann sniffling) (solemn music) - We did everything we could. No doctor could've saved that baby either. (solemn music) (baby crying) I'll leave you alone with her for awhile. - How is she? - She's weak. - Come to the office when you're through. We need to discuss the burial arrangements for your son. (solemn music) (baby crying faintly) (Walter sobbing) (solemn music) - (sighs) Just about time for me to go. - You take care of yourself, Iris. - For sure. I'm off to my sister's. - [Will] That'll be nice. - Hope so. Looks like I might be able to stay with her and her family for a wee while anyway. - I'll take you to the station if you like? - Now it's time to go it's not so easy (sighs). Last thing my dad ever said to me was I was a worthless tramp. Nobody'd give me a kind word 'til you did. Please don't make me go. - Sooner or later, you're gonna have to get out on your own, Iris. - It doesn't have to be today. - Rose is hemorrhaging again. We have to get her into hospital in Halifax now! (suspenseful music) (engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) - [Lila] Hold on for me, Rose. Hold on. (suspenseful music) (engine rumbling) Won't have a thing to worry about. They'll fix ya up fine. Hold on for me, Rose. (solemn music) (Lila sighs) (solemn music) - 7 x 10 is 70. 7 x 11 is 77. 7 x 12 is 84. - Now the eights. - [Boy] 8 x 1 is 8. - Death occurred from an internal infection, which led to a severe loss of blood. Her infection was probably brought on through the use of improperly sterilized instruments. As to the male babe, I'm fairly confident it actually breathed though imperfectly. It suffered severe injury to the head and destruction of the brain. - How in God's name could this have happened? - I guess it'd be through use of forceps, but don't quote me. - She's not licensed to use forceps. - The infant was too large for the birth canal. In dramatic deliveries of this kind, she had three options. Call in a doctor, allow nature to take its course and watch them both die, or ignore the law and take matters into her own hands. You know Lila Young. What do you think she did? This should be grounds for an arrest. (solemn music) - Hypocrites. (solemn music) - [Guard] Your brother's here to see you, Mrs. Young. - William. Lila. (sighs) They got a case against ya all right. (Lila sighs) - It's a lotta nonsense. A buncha arrogant bureaucrats trying to humiliate me. - They've charged you with two counts of manslaughter. - Eva Nyforth was the first girl to die in our care in eight years. How many homes, how many doctors can claim that? - That means bugger all, Will. They're gonna prosecute you. - Persecute us you mean. - You need a good lawyer. - I've never asked for your help before Fred, and we'll pay back every nickel. - I can't raise this kind of bail on my own, you know? I'll talk to the family. See what we can come up with. - Always comes down to money doesn't it? The fact we have a business, our family's been here for 100 years means nothing. Them that have get and the rest of us can rot. - Sit tight. It'll take a couple of days. I'll see what I can do. - God bless you, Fred. (solemn music) (court attendees chattering) (solemn music) - I suspect they'll try and prove lack of adequate care by claiming illegal forceps interference. Remember, they have no such instrument entered into their evidence. If you say you didn't do it, it's your word against that of their pathologist. - Mr. Justice, John Doull, all rise. - [Crown Attorney] Dr. Smith, could you please describe to us the condition of the Nyforth baby? - Yes. It had suffered severe injury to the head and destruction of the brain. The baby's head had been cut across the top from ear to ear. The occipital bone had been broken. The scalp had been partly torn away and two frontal bones had been loosened. - And in your expert opinion, Doctor, what could have caused this? - The unskillful use of instruments, forceps. - Are you aware that legally, a midwife may not perform any surgical procedure? - Yes, I am. - Tell the court Miss O'Dwyer, did Mrs. Young attempt a surgical procedure in her effort to deliver the Nyforth baby? (pensive music) Miss O'Dwyer? - Yes. She found it necessary to use instruments that she did not normally use. - Thank you. No further questions, Your Honor. (solemn music) (Will's throat clears) - The crisis came on quickly. It was emotionally charged. As the attending nurse, hadn't you responsibilities that required your immediate care and full attention? - Yes. I monitored blood pressure, pulse. I kept a close eye on her level of sedation. - So, you couldn't possibly have watched Mrs. Young at all times could you? - I was in the room. - I see. You saw unfamiliar instruments, but you didn't watch, not closely. - Not closely, no, I- - Thank you. She believes she saw unfamiliar instruments, but she cannot say that she closely watched the procedure. Thank you. No further questions, Your Honor. - She used forceps. And when I asked her what she was doing, she told me she had to look to the girl. - I thought they were doctors. If I didn't believe that Eva was gonna get the best of care, I would have never left her in the hands of that woman. Never. She said Eva was gonna get better, but she lied to me. She killed my little Eva, and she killed my son. (court attendees whispering) (pensive music) - There was nothing else I could do. The infant was stillborn. Any question of saving it had been answered by God. - The provincial pathologist suggests the baby was alive and breathed. - That doctor is looking for any excuse to prove me guilty, anything to support his contempt of our mission. He's in there with the Health Minister and Dr. Kennedy. They think that my work is dirty, that my girls are dirt. (court attendees chattering) I stand here before God and know in my heart, I've done nothing wrong. (gavel banging) - Mrs. Young, please. - So, you do no surgery at the sanitarium? - None whatsoever. Nor abortions. - And you deny using any instruments that might cause the damage described by Dr. Smith? - The baby was too big for the birth canal and it had water on the brain. The skull was soft and easy to puncture even with gloved hands. - Mrs. Young, I'm sure the court is curious to know why you do this kind of work. - My husband and I feel it is our responsibility, our Christian duty. Since we opened our refuge, you can well imagine how many girls have come to us. Often they are 15, 16 year old children. Guilt-ridden, desperate, discarded by their families, abandoned by their so-called lovers, and often after they've done everything in their power to rid themselves of the baby inside them. Scalding beds, turpentine, knitting needles. - Objection, Your Honor. The defense is purposely allowing this witness to digress. - Sustained. Mr. Rutledge? - Tell us in your own words then, what happened to Eva Nyforth and her baby, Mrs. Young? - Will and I took Eva Nyforth into our home out of Christian love. There was Bible instruction and daily prayer, an atmosphere respectful of our beliefs. I sat with that girl day and night after her delivery, nothing more could have been done to save her life. It should be put on record that Dr. Pat Kennedy has frequently refused to come to our sanitarium with deliveries that were also a matter of life and death. I couldn't move her in a crisis. I had to look to the safety of the mother on my own. - Objection, Your Honor, the defense pointedly refuses to control his client. This woman knowingly placed herself above the medical profession and the law by undertaking a surgical procedure on an innocent patient, a procedure in which she has no training, let alone a medical license. - Your witness is incompetent and insensitive. Ask your pathologist, Mr. Robertson, about the disgusting and inhumane way he tossed that girl's body like a heap of garbage into a box! (court attendees exclaiming) - Control your client. Mr. Rutledge. - We took that poor child in because she made a mistake. She just made a mistake. You may choose to believe the local doctors, Pat Kennedy and the Health Minister, Frank Davis, who hate and revile my girls, but my judge is God. And God knows I did everything in my power to save Eva Nyforth. (court attendees chattering) (pensive music) - We, the jury find the accused, William Pete Young, and Lila Gladys Young, on all counts, not guilty. (Lila gasps) (court attendees chattering) - As David smoked the Philistine, praise God! (gavel banging) - Order. The Young's are conducting their business, an unfortunately necessary one in our society in good faith. Let's see them do it quietly and with less interference henceforth. This case is closed. (gavel bangs) (pensive music) (court attendees chattering) (children laughing) - Stop it. - Bud! - Get off my toes! - [Matron] Come along, children. (girl giggles) (child shushing) Orderly fashion, no running. - [Girl] Shh, quiet. - [Matron] There you go, Billy. We're already complying with the new regulations, Mr. Cameron. - Good. If all the homes were this cooperative Matron, I'd have nothing to do. - You'll want to see the register in my office of course. We not only take down names and addresses, but we now have the girls occupations if any. (children chattering) - John? - [John] Russ! - (chuckles) How are you? (John chuckles) - I heard tell it was you that got together this Maternity Boarding House Act? - Yeah. - Great guns. - Well, I didn't quite get everything I'd hoped for but. - You'll drag us kickin' and screamin' into the 20th century yet. - Yeah. What's wrong with this little one? - Well, look at his legs. Rickets. His mother drowned after a drunken brawl over at Mary's Cove. Terrible tragedy. (baby crying) Now the relatives don't have anything to do with the child. - And why is that? - Well, she only adopted the kid a couple of months ago. Apparently paid five bucks for him over at the Young's home in East Chester. - He was already in a sorry state before he left that home. I'm certain. - And this isn't the first case of theirs I've seen either. Ear infections, deafness, blood poisoning, even malnutrition. I dread to think what else happens over at that place. - Well, at least they'll be forced to raise their standards now with the new regulations. - You're not gonna license them are ya? - Well, "Better to license them and have some control over their business than to have them go unlicensed with no control." The great and honorable philosopher, Dr. Frank Davis. He's got the Life and Health Sanitarium in his writing. - Well, you'll rue the day you ever license Lila Young. (solemn music) (engine rumbling) - [Iris] It's not such a bad place. - [Red Headed Woman] If I had a husband there's no way you'd catch me here. After bunking with the Young's and 20 knocked up broads, I'd kill to be alone with someone. - [Iris] Quit your belly achin'. You're darn lucky to be taken in. - [Red Headed Woman] In this prison? After I get out, I'm takin' a whole day in bed, drinkin' coffee and smokin' 'til I'm blue in the face. - [Russell] That should do you a world of good. (plate shatters) - Not everything a girl does can be good for her. - [Russell] Apparently not. Who's in charge here? - Can I help ya? - I'm Russell Cameron, Assistant Director of Child Welfare. Where is Nurse O'Dwyer? - [Red Headed Woman] She doesn't work here anymore. - You'll have to speak to Dr. Young. They'll be back soon. - Well, I'll need to see the nursery. (solemn music) Do the mothers look after their own infants? - Lila, Dr. Young doesn't like that sorta thing. - No. - They get attached, eh? - Yeah. - She gets them adopted out as quick as she can. - Don't any of them keep their own kids? - Uh uh. - Well, surely she can't adopt them all out? - No. - What about these babies? They've been here awhile. - They've been sick. They're okay now. People won't take a sick baby. - And what about the ones that don't get better? (babies babbling) Well, I'll need to see Mrs. Young's files. - The Young's will back real soon. - Unfortunately, I don't have time to wait and regulations oblige you to open up your files to me at any time without notice. - Well, all right, then. (gentle music) (engine rumbling) - Hello you two. So good to see you. - Oh, when did you start kissin' everybody? No. - Oh, for Pete sake, Lila. You're my sister. Nice to see you, too. So, do you want drinks? - Here's half of what we owe. Tell the others they'll get the rest by Christmas. - [Iris] I'm sure the Young's will be back from lunch soon. - I also need to see the latest registrations of births and deaths, please. (pensive music) (papers rustling) Oh, thank you. And what are these, the accounts receivable? - Some girls pay in installments type thing, eh? - Oh, and the adoption files please. So I see you've had your baby, huh? - Uh huh. - How come you're still here then? - Nowhere else to go. Mrs. Young's been good to me. (pensive music) (papers rustling) - Excuse me, Doctor and Mrs. Young. - Oh, Senator. - How are you keeping? - Senator. - Thank you. - I apologize for disturbing you, but I want to introduce you to Mrs. Elizabeth Chadway and Mr. Clayton Oliver of New York. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Mrs. Young, we've heard a great deal about the wonderful work you're doing here with troubled girls. - Really? - Yes, you see a Mrs. Chadway involves herself in a great many benevolent activities in New York City. - We're here for the summer. Perhaps we might have the opportunity to get together and discuss your work. - That'd be lovely. - Good. - Gentlemen. - Senator, say hello to Virginia and David. - Oh, I will. They'll be pleased. Their little Jeanette is doing just famously. - Glad to hear it. - See? It pays to eat in the right places. - Don't fool yourself you're so posh, Fred. - Fool yourself, a few others, pretty soon Lila, you are. - What do you suppose this Mrs. Chadway wants? - Stop it! Quit pushin'! Ow! - Boys, settle down! - Daniel, get into your night shirt. (boys laughing) She's not a candidate for an adoption. Maybe she wants to talk about her benevolent work. Hand me that. - Or maybe we found our first benefactor. (crickets chirping) (gentle music) - We keep hearing excellent reports on your work, Mrs. Young. - [Lila] Really? - Yes, we understand that you guarantee complete privacy for both the deliveries and the adoptions. - Privacy above all. People are so quick to blame the girls. Their lives are wrecked under the weight of it. - So you're doing a high volume of adoptions then? - Reasonably so. Hard though, finding families who can afford to take them in. - Ah, there she is. This is Fiona, my granddaughter. - How far along are you, about five months? - Privacy you see would be the first consideration for a girl like Fiona. - It is for all my girls. - Well, Fiona can stay on here after we leave. We'll just say that she's gone straight on to finishing school. - You didn't have to invite me here. You coulda just brought her to the Sanitarium. What we were hoping is that you'd be kind enough to arrange for Fiona's care here in this house. - That wouldn't be practical for me. - Please, don't make me go to that home, Nana. - But I'm willing to pay whatever is necessary to handle this matter with the utmost delicacy. - Delicacy's part of my package, no extra cost. - Please. You're not giving me the opportunity to explain. - Don't bother. Sex really is society's great leveler. If you wanna discuss this further, bring her to my office. Good day. (Mrs. Chadway sighs) - Mrs. Young? Look, I know how you must feel. - I doubt it. If you want me to look after the girl, you know where to find me. - This is particularly uncomfortable for them and no one has wished to offend you. - Nope. I'm sure it's just instinct with you people. - May I put the issue of Fiona aside for one minute? Mrs. Young, how many babies have you got up there at any given time? - Pardon me? - You implied the locals don't make particularly good parental candidates. So at the end of the day, you must have your hands full of children. Is that so? - I don't see what this has to do with you. - My law firm in New York has plenty of well-off clients, wonderful potential parents I would have thought. People who would pay the world for a beautiful, healthy baby, but they can't get anywhere with the state run agencies. It's too much red tape, it's too long to wait. You can pretty well name your price. You don't have to say yes right now, just take my card. Unfortunately, I'm going back to New York tomorrow, but if you wanna talk about some business, just call me. (engine rumbling) Thank you. (pensive music) - Well, we can hardly be seen to publicly object to the Young's going after the father for support when we're trying to impose the same measures through our own institutions. - Frank, look at the dates. - [Frank] Hm? - Look, the kid was dead. This is a clear cut case of fraud. They threatened the poor bastard into coughing up 150 bucks. - Have you talked to this Jordy Macdonald? - Yeah. - And is he willing to testify? - Yeah, yeah, reluctantly but he will. (lighter flicks) (pensive music) (Frank sighs) - Marie, get me Corporal Stevens. - Rutledge did such a good job for us on the Nyforth case. I can't understand why he won't take this one. - I never liked the man to begin with. He just wanted his name in the paper. Well, it was our case that made his reputation and now he's too good for us? Nothin' but politics. - What are we gonna do? (pensive music) - We're going to get a better lawyer and I don't care how much it costs. And we're not going begging to my family again either. (rotary dial spinning) - Who are you callin'? - Long distance please. - Right now I have several couples, both in New Jersey and in New York. - How much would they be willing to pay? - In certain cases $1.000, maybe even $2.000. My clients have already been through the system. Mostly they've been rejected because the state run homes will not allow a baby to be adopted by a couple of a different religious faith. I gather you two have no such restrictions? - We need to talk this over. - I didn't travel all this way to get jimmied around. The sooner I can get a decision the sooner I can put the money in your pockets. - How much do you get out of all this? - We'll meet them first. - Yeah, Doctor, please don't take this the wrong way, but we're so grateful for this precious little one. We waited a long time. - You were the first people who have helped us when no one else would. - A baby isn't born with a religion. That comes from the parents. - We wanted to do something for your mission here. An additional contribution. - You are doing a truly wonderful thing here. Please, with our sincerest thanks. (pensive music) (baby cooing) - Thank you. - Thank you. It's not a donation, Lila. It could look like we're selling babies for profit. It's against the law. - Whose law? The law that's persecuting us in the courts for trying to send Daisy back to her family? The law that's forcing us to hire lawyers we can ill afford? - We don't know who these people are. - (sighs) What guarantee do we have when we send any child out into the world? People with money have got to be able to give a child a better life than it'll ever get 'round here. - We've gotta put our faith and trust in God, Lila. - And in our deed and in theirs, God has sent them to us. Will, we have to defend our mission, and the Lord helps those who help themselves. (solemn music) (pensive music) - [Crown Attorney] And so Miss Thomas, you told the Young's that as your baby had died, you desperately wanted to return home? - Yes, Sir. But they wouldn't let me leave. They forced me to come with them to Halifax. On the way she told me not to mention that the baby had died. (pensive music) I just wanted to go home to my mom. I was scared. They kept me there against my will. - Wasn't it the girl who told you that the child was still alive? - No. I never spoke two words to her. It was Mr. and Mrs. Young. I'm not sure which. - Well, then how can you be sure of what they actually said? - No, I'm sure. I asked them if they tried to adopt the baby and they said that they still had it and that it was well. - On the charge of defrauding Jordy Macdonald of the city of Halifax by using false pretenses, we find the defendants guilty. (court attendees chattering) - I set the fine at $500 or 30 days in jail. (gavel bangs) - [Woman] What she did. - [Man] It's ridiculous. - [Woman] Terrible. I know. (court attendees chattering) - Well, I must say everyone 'round here is shocked at the lengths they'll go to, Lila. - Well, the jury sided with Davis, but the judge was on our side. He only gave us a fine of $500. - I guess that's the kind of government we put into power. Wanna control the little money you bring in here. - Well, we don't have to stand for it do we, Hank? - [Hank] Maybe you ought to run for politics, Lila. (Lila chuckles) - A lousy $500 fine. I mean, what is that? We got the conviction and they're thumbing their noses at us. - I'm sure they've learned a lesson. - A lesson. Look, Frank, look, she's advertising infants for adoption. - I am already being accused by my constituents of picking on Lila Young. You should read my mail sometime. - Look, you gotta revoke their license. - I don't have to do anything. - Look, please take a look at the reforms and then consider your view. - I know your views on the matter. - You have to revoke their license, Frank. - Don't push me on this. (door latches) (solemn music) - Oh yes, of course we're fully licensed by the Province of Nova Scotia, now. They prefer to ignore us, but they've been forced to recognize the important social service we provide. Thank you, Iris. (baby cooing) (solemn music) Of course we could never undertake our mission without the generous support of couples like yourselves. - Oh, is that a smile? - Yeah, it looks it. (all chuckling) - [Clayton] Isn't that what this is all about? - This makes every moment that we've waited for this all seem worthwhile. - She is so beautiful. You'll never know how much this baby will be loved. - Will, the Kellerman's might enjoy seeing the plans for the new edition. - This expansion has been a dream of ours for a long time. (pensive music) In these troubled days, there were so many young girls in need of refuge and care, and it's contributions like yours that'll make all this possible. 54 rooms, 14 bathrooms. We're going to have the latest laboratory facilities, sterilization equipment, the highest standards of hygiene. (workers chattering) - [Man] You got it? - [Man] Yeah, here it goes. (workers chattering) - Just give me a minute. Have a safe trip home. - They seem like awful good people. She said she'd tell all her friends about us. - As God and His judgment sees fit, Iris. (workers chattering) This place'll be bigger and more important than those little government men with their little government minds. They'll never dare to come after us again. (solemn music) (brakes squealing) (solemn music) - This humble dwelling was destined to become a mighty factor in the future health and happiness of generations of Canadian infants. Overcoming enormous obstacles, Lila and William Young pioneered the work of child welfare, developing strong, healthy babies with delightful surroundings for mother and child. (onlookers applauding) - Senator. - Ah. (onlookers chattering) (onlookers applauding) - Reverend Beggs? Excuse me. Glad you could come. - [Reverend Beggs] My pleasure. - Will and I want you to have this, a gift for your own building fund. - Lila, this is more than generous. - Well, we know our duty. After all, we do have a tidy little business here now. - You want some ice cream sweetie? - You want down? Yeah, okay. Let go, go with daddy. (solemn music) - I wonder if you happen to remember this little lady? - I'll say so. I remember the day you were born. - And now it's tickle time, tickle time, tickle, tickle, tickle (laughs). (solemn music) - Hello there, sweetie pie. - Why, thank you. (solemn music) Is there a show? - Iris? Hurry up. The newspaper wants to take a picture and they won't wait for ya. (babies crying) (solemn music) Come on, Iris, smile. - [Photographer] Big smiles everyone, come on. We want to say nothing but happy babies, nothing but happy babies. (babies crying) (shutter clicks) - (chuckles) Well, I'm too young to retire. You'll see a Davis on another ballot yet. - [Man] You got my vote, Frank. - How are you folks doing? - [Man] Good, good. Hello, Frank. - Good to see ya. - How are ya? - [Man] Good work, Frank. - Hello, Frank. The place looks pretty impressive from the outside doesn't it? The inside of course is anybody's guess. - I'm obligated to be here, Russell. I'm surprised to see you. Hey, I can play Lila Young's test of guts. She has the gall to invite me here, I wouldn't miss it. (Frank chuckles) (pensive music) - You can't abide seeing her get the upper hand can you? - Tell me something, Frank, where do you think that all this money's coming from here? - Obviously the war is creating a boom in more than the Halifax economy. - Uh huh, and how many babies do you figure she's shunting into cribs and selling like puppies then? I mean, take a look around. She's taking in what? Thousands of dollars here. And it's not all strictly from the girl's fees is it? - How do you explain that half the county is supporting her? Because she's providing a useful service. Now don't waste your energy on this, Russ. - You never saw Eva Nyforth and her baby. I can't shake that image, Frank. And how many other babies are there that we know nothing about? Look, Sir, all I'm asking you for are the tools. You give me the R.C.M.P. and the medical examiners, and I'll get you the evidence. - Russ, stop taking this so personally. - (chuckles) I'm prepared to go to the Premier on this if I have to. - The local community is behind her 100%. Now, I've already stuck my neck out in promising to strengthen your new adoption laws. Those changes are as far as I'm prepared to go at the present time. Patience is a virtue. And if you go behind my back, you're out of a job. (pensive music) Hello gentlemen. - The gall of Frank Davis trying to drum up votes on our lawn. It's his government approvals and probationary periods that our perspective parents will never stand for. - They'll go someplace else if they have to wait another year to adopt. - Yeah. - Every year it's a new set of rules and regulations. - As head of the Board of Trade, I'd like to remind you that with the war on and the legitimate baby boom around Halifax, this home brought in a staggering $50.000 this past year alone into our local economy gentlemen. - We've carried out God's work successfully for 12 years with very simple rules. - And Frank Davis doesn't give a Tinker's damn about the girls or our business. He's just interested in covering his political backside. - Well, you know my sentiments, Lila, My granddaughter is a testament to the fruits of your kindness and good works. The Premier is a reasonable man. Let me take care of Frank Davis. - I've got a better idea. Let's see to it that Davis never holds office in this writing again. (Senator chuckles) - Hear hear. (pensive music) And dictatorship. Defeat Davis. Restore democracy. Make voting day a victory day over Frank Davis! (audience applauding) - [Protestors] Hear hear! - The voters in this county have a solemn responsibility come election day. There is a war being fought in Europe against dictatorship. But we have a Hitler right here in Nova Scotia! - [Protestors] Hear hear, hear hear! - And it appears a Mrs. Goebbels has also come to Nova Scotia, who evidently believes that if the truth is misrepresented often enough, it will eventually be believed. Well, I maintain that the voters of this province are too intelligent to fall for this campaign of slander. - They want to control our operations to prevent undesirables from exploiting illegitimate children. - [Woman] Oh, that's true. - I can only imagine why, since the son of the present Public Health Minister is rumored to have fathered a child born in our home. He just wants to make darn sure he has some say over the perspective parents of his own grandchild. (women exclaiming) (women applauding) - Thank you. We're gonna win this one, hm? Thanks for your support. Thank you. - [Protestors] Hear hear. - Russ, nail her. I'll give you whatever you need. Thank you. Thanks for coming out. I'm counting on your support. (pensive music) (babies crying) - Iris (sighs). Where are the other girls? - They're nervous around the fluey babies. This little guys runnin' a bad fever. - Well, move 'em into the sickroom and keep them away from the healthy ones. - I can't get his temperature down, Lila. - A good cold wash cloth and plenty of fluids, and don't spend all day with him or you'll never get the others fed. Oh, look at the time. I have perspective parents coming at two o'clock. Iris, if you don't move the sick babies away from the healthy ones, we'll never get this croup under control. - But it's too much for me, tryin' to rustle up those girls to get their work done. We need to hire a professional nurse, Lila. - All right I'll get a couple of the capable girls up here to help you. (door slams) (babies crying) (solemn music) (crickets chirping) - It's not like we used to be. Mrs. McPhee and Ann. No one cares now. - Well, she's been awful good to us. - I know. I just feel bad thinkin' about the little ones nobody wants to adopt. If they aren't perfect or they don't have lily white skin, she doesn't want anybody seein' 'em. So, put 'em in with the sick ones. It's almost like she wants 'em to die on purpose. - Nah, don't think that way. - My little girl was real lucky. She survived. She got a good home. (Iris sighs) Sometimes, I wish I could hold her again, even for a minute. (solemn music) (crickets chirping) (door slams) - [Lila] What business have you here? - We are legally entitled to inspect these premises. We'll require a complete register the containing names, addresses and ages of all your tenants. (babies crying) (crib clanging) (babies crying) - How dare you march in here like this! By next week, Frank Davis will be out of office and you little man, will be out of a job. Please put those children down. I don't want you upsetting them. I said, put that baby down. (door latches) (solemn music) We have the strictest (indistinct) that must be adhered to. - [Russell] Still here, huh? (baby crying) - Are doctors ever called in here, Iris? Are you the only one of duty for all these kids? And when they get sick, and they die? Listen, if you have any information for me, any information at all that can help me to protect these children, I want you to contact me. All right? (crib clanging) (solemn music) (babies crying) - [Radio Anchor] The Liberal Party has swept the provinces winning 28 of 30 seats and Dr. Frank Roy Davis has retained his seat in Newburgh County. Other cabinet ministers reelected include- (button clicks) (pensive music) (engine rumbling) - It's our May, Dr. Young. She's so close. We were planning to take her to the hospital in Halifax where Lester's stationed, but I was afraid - You'll be all right. - she would have the - Take it easy. - grandchild on the way. - You got her? - I'll prep her. How are ya, May? - [May] Oh, I'm okay. But you better look after my Dad, huh? (Will chuckles) (May grunting) - Lila, are you okay? - May, May, stop pushing. It's not time yet. (May grunting) - I can't help it. - That's a foot ain't it? - I know. - What's wrong, Lila? - Nothing's wrong. Get me a clean towel. - If there's somethin' wrong- - There's nothing wrong. Just get me the towel and go and get William. - [May] Jesus, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna- - [Lila] You're not gonna die. You're gonna be fine. - [Iris] Dr. Young? (May panting) - It's a foot limb breech. Help me move her. Up. (May sobs) I'm gonna get that foot back in. - All right, May. Just relax. Now, don't push. Don't push. - Ready? (May grunting) (baby cooing) (gentle music) - I'm just takin' her to the nursery. She'll be back soon. - My baby's okay, huh? - Well, her feet come first and she almost got stuck, but the Young's got her out just fine. She's strong and healthy. - Wrap that quilt around her will ya, Iris? My mom made it. - You're real lucky to have a little girl like this. Try to get some sleep. They said you lost a lotta blood. (May sighs) - We're deeply sorry about your daughter's passing. - You signed an agreement assuring us that our little girl was normal and healthy. - What happens to a child after it leaves this home can't be our responsibility, especially after 18 months. - A normal child's heart just doesn't stop for no reason, 18 months or not. - (sighs) A child is not an ice box or a radio. It can't come with a guarantee. - Look, don't patronize me. You took $10.000 from us. - Darling, please. Look, all we want is another baby girl. - I'm sorry, Mrs. Kellerman, we don't have any baby girls. We've plenty of boys. - What about this one? - [Lila] No, you can have the next available girl. - Darling, come here, look. (Mrs. Kellerman gasps) - That baby is not up for adoption. - Mrs. Young. - Look, I am not one of your local yokels who you think you can just elbow around. We want this baby. I won't think twice about going to the papers and the radio. - Why don't you wait downstairs, give me a chance to talk to Mrs. Young. I am certain that we'll come to some kind of arrangement. I'll talk privately. - [Mr. Kellerman] Yeah, well, you better. - That's better. (pensive music) - [Will] The peril of our souls. - [Clayton] Please. Look, spare me this righteous indignation. (pensive music) Give them exactly what they want. This man is not kidding about going to the papers. - I'm sure once Mrs. Kellerman realizes that the mother is married- - She fully intends on keeping her baby. - So tell her it died. - Don't be ridiculous. - You better think long and hard about how many deals I've swung for you now. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars I have funneled into those pockets of yours. Just give them that God damn baby. - We will do no such thing. - I'm telling you right now, if this thing comes crashing down around me, I'll use every legal tool I have to bury both of ya. Excuse me. (babies crying) (door slams) (pensive music) (engine rumbling) - I wouldn't give a dog I like to people like that. Acted like they were buying a late model car. Bad publicity is bad for them, too. Oliver's just trying to threaten us. Oh Lord, what are we doing? Lord, help us. What are we doing, Lila? This was never meant to be a business. I'm afraid. I'm afraid for our own family. Let's get out. - People like that just don't go away. - Our answer has always been in prayer, Lila. - You pray, for both of us. (pensive music) (door slams) (dramatic music) (engine rumbling) - Lila, Mrs. Fell is here. - Oh. - Mrs. Young, this is May's husband, Lester. - I tried to get here sooner. What happened? - It was a very traumatic delivery for May and the baby was very, very weak. - She know the baby's dead yet? - I told her this morning. Naturally she was upset. I had to give her a sedative. - I'll take you up to see her now if you like? - Yeah, yeah. Can I see my daughter? - Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson. She's not fit for viewing. William and I will deliver the body in an appropriate manner for burial. It'll be less upsetting that way. (solemn music) (doors latching) (solemn music) (William sighs) Will? - Lila, please, my heart's not in this anymore. - Do you want me to carry the box 'cause I will? (pensive music) - Come on. - It's not my baby. Why aren't you listening to me? It's not my baby. (mourners chattering murmuring) - I wanna see my daughter. (Lila sighs) - I know how difficult this is for you, Mr. Wilson, but I cannot allow the coffin to be opened. - I need to put my wife's mind at rest. - But the body has turned black. - [Woman] Oh! - [Woman] Oh, dear. - Most- - Totally. - [Woman] This is absolutely terrible. Oh dear. - If the body has turned black, then it's God's will we not see it. - [May] It's not my baby. - Take May home, Lester. - Come on. Everyone's upset, come on. - [Lester] Come on. (solemn music) (Iris sobs) (pensive music) - I know what I heard. Those people wanted a girl baby and May's was the only healthy one in the nursery. - You're just upset. How could she make a mistake like that? - That's what I'm saying. Maybe it wasn't. - Wasn't what? - A mistake. Maybe it wasn't a mistake (sighs). (pensive music) (crickets chirping) (children laughing) - What's this all about Reverend? - Please, both of you have a seat. We've had some serious charges leveled at you by our members. - Charges? - And there are mounting rumors in the community about the Wilson baby. - So now we're to be persecuted by our own church, I suppose? - Lila, for once listen to something besides the sound of your own voice. - What are you doing here? - Representing the family. This is an embarrassment for all of us. - What is going on? - We have received letters with charges that impugn your mortal souls. - There's not a shred of truth in this. - Can you swear before God, Lila? Otherwise, confess your sin and seek forgiveness. - It's about tithing isn't it? You want more money. - It has nothing to do with the tithe. It is a blatant disregard for life and the sale of life that puts your standing as members under scrutiny. (paper rustling) Then the church will have no choice but one. Disfellowship. You'll be obliged to leave. - Lila, I'm a good Christian. And so are you. - How dare you, Will! I stand here before God and know in my heart I've done nothing wrong. (birds chirping) (drawer sliding) What are you doing? - Nothing. (baby crying) - You're looking in the right place. Those are the old files. (solemn music) - What happened to May Wilson's baby? - It died. - Of what? - It stopped breathing. You knew it was having a hard time. - That's not true. - I beg your pardon? - I heard you talking to that Mr. Oliver, and the Kellerman's. - I made our position quite clear to Mr. Oliver at that time. - You think I'm stupid, that I really don't know. I know about you. - Get out of here, right now. - You don't care about the girls or the babies. You liar! You took my baby from me. Maybe I couldn't have given her a good home, but what was wrong with May Wilson's home? You don't have the right to do that to her. You just don't have that right. (solemn music) - Iris. Don't you dare walk away from me when I'm talking to you. Iris! - My name is Maureen. - Iris? (solemn music) Iris? Iris? (solemn music) (engine rumbling) Iris? Hank, would you make up the order? (engine rumbling) (pensive music) (engine rumbling) (pensive music) (brakes squealing) (pensive music) Will! What's going on? (pensive music) This is trespassing! Get out, get out! Out! - Mrs. Young. Based on evidence given to us by a Miss Maureen Donnelley, I have a warrant for this information. - (gasps) You! You never gave a damn about the girls. What did you ever do but shuffle paper and legislate away your guilt? - I am happy to inform you that your license has been revoked. Don't bother reapplying. - I have safely delivered nearly 900 babies on these premises! - Yes and you traded them like a commodity or buried them when it suited you. - Yes!
