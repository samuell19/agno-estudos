Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. KAMAGONG (IRONWOOD) Melissa. It's dad. Tarsila, try to explain to him. Let's go, Belen. Tarsila. Why are you so stubborn? I already told you that women are prohibited in the hill if there's a duel of arnis. Captain Simon, I'm begging you. - Let me. - I can't disobey the elders. Just stay right there. Don't fight him, Emilio. Lorenzo is a cheater. It's not enough that you're just ready in arnis. I'm afraid of what's going to happen. I am more afraid of what's going to happen to me, if I will not face him. In the eyes of the residents here in Mabolo, The man you're going to marry is a coward. Emilio. Lorenzo. You will fight as gallant warriors of arnis. The heat of the blood, hatred in the chest should not prevail. My judgment is final and should be followed. Anyone who will give up should let go of the arnis sticks for the fight to stop. You start as a gallant man, you'll end up as the better man in the name of arnis de mano. Start the duel. Hit him! Why did he do that? Is that allowed in arnis, Manuel? Let's wait for the decision of Master Sutero. But he doesn't see it. You're already good in arnis, but you still lack experience. Lorenzo's cheating skills are working again. Manuel, stop the fight! Lorenzo is cheating! Didn't I tell you, let's wait for Master Sutero's decision? Fight, brother! Fight! Manuel! Let's ask them to stop the fight. He is still holding the arnis sticks, Ariel. That's enough! End your problem in the hill. Brother! Brother! Brother. Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother. Brother. Emilio! Emilio! Emilio! Emilio! Wake up, brother. Brother. Brother. Brother. Brother. Wake up, Emilio! Brother. Brother. Emilio. Emilio. You shameless bastard! Criminal! Criminal! You killed him. You killed him. You killed him. Emilio and I are both losers. Right, Tarsila? Him in arnis, me in your heart. The only difference is I'm alive and he's dead. You will die too, Lorenzo. You are also going to die. You are also going to die! That's enough! Calm down. You, Master Sutero, you're the mediator. You saw that my brother was cheated. He already lost the arnis sticks. What did Lorenzo do? What? Ariel, that's enough. They both engaged in a fight. And it is unfortunate that your brother fell from the hill. The Elders saw what happened. They want to hide the brutality of arnis. That's why they want my brother's coffin covered. Is that right, Manuel? That's enough, Ariel. Ariel was right, Captain. What Lorenzo did was a crime and he must be held responsible. I know he intentionally killed Emilio. Lorenzo couldn't accept that I don't like him. And that is the reason. She's right, dad. You know Lorenzo is really arrogant. He cannot accept his defeat. They say that arnis is a gentleman's game. But they allowed Lorenzo who is so arrogant. I'm not taking sides. There are regulations being followed in the arnis fight. And according to Sutero, who was the mediator of the fight. Emilio's death was not intended. Emilio slipped and fell off the hill. Many people saw it. Lorenzo did too much cruelty. Emilio couldn't fight anymore but he still hit him. He made his anger to Emilio too personal and that is against the rules of arnis. He needed to let go of the arnis sticks as a sign of surrender. And until Emilio fell from the hill he was still holding the sticks. In the tone of your words, Lorenzo is not responsible? Are we just going to let. Emilio's death get no justice? I'm so sorry, Tarsila. The Elders have decided. The Elders. All that's important to them is the game arnis. They become blind and deaf to any harm. The important thing to them is to have the game arnis alive in this town. Even if all the men here die. You know, Manuel after weighing everything that happened. Lorenzo is not at fault. It just so happened that he is more skillful. And that he has stronger arms, that's why Emilio suffered that tragedy. If you plan to persecute Lorenzo, not in the law, not in the court. In a gallant battle up the hill. Lorenzo already ran away. Maybe he got scared to be sued. He brought the arnis with him. Could he really use it as a livelihood in Manila? He just desecrated arnis here in our place. He will answer to the Elders. You should follow. You should follow me, okay? Don't be so hard. Don't be so brave. Manuel! Manuel! Ariel is beating the horse! I was trying to stop him, but he tried to hit me too. What is the problem? Manuel, Dencio? Ariel is trying to beat the horse. Just yesterday he was angry with the carabao too. Wait a second, dad. I'll just go there. Enough! I said stop. You will gain nothing. If anger will prevail in you, you'll have no direction. You'll even defy a horse. Is this the only thing that will happen to my brother? All the people here knows that he was killed. Are we just going to let him be in the grave without anyone getting held responsible? He paid for my studies. He has many dreams for me! Now what? Even if I finish all my studies, no matter how good I become, can he still see it? Manuel! You're my brother's friend. Help him. You are the only one who can help him. I want to help you. But not in the way that you are thinking. Well, since you are an orphan now, why don't you stay with us? We will become brothers. That's not it, Manuel. You know what I want to happen. Why don't you want to fight Lorenzo? Are you scared of him? Why don't you use the kamagong to him? You're a coward, Manuel. Coward! I fear no one. The decision of the Elders should be respected. Hatred should not prevail. Arnis is a gallant's sport, Ariel. Gallant? Anger should not prevail? What did Lorenzo do to my brother? Was he gallant? Manuel. I feel the kid has a point. Your request is a little difficult, Manuel. You know the rules of the Elders about the use of kamagong. It can only be handled by the man who is the best in arnis. You can only use the kamagong arnis in fighting for justice and for correcting the wrong. Ariel demands for justice, Grandpa Sutero. We witnessed it, in the fight of Emilio and Lorenzo. Is there a mistake that should be straightened? Do not look at me like that. Even if Lorenzo is my nephew, I was fair in their fight. If that's the case, Ariel will really be disappointed. Look at the kamagong arnis sticks. Look closely. It can only be used in the glorious mission of the great men. Is Ariel already worthy of this? He's still young to hold the kamagong arnis sticks. He still has no right to hold them. The moon will round ten times. He will count that while holding the kamagong sticks. The moon will still round twice to witness his flight, like a bird. Until he lands, like a dry leaf while still holding the kamagong sticks. Can a kid like Ariel be able to that? Let's not belittle the ability of the young, Grandpa Sutero. Although his mind is still immature, I could feel the boiling steel in his chest. Pen and paper are the only things that he can hold. His fingers are only adept in opening the books. Elusive. His mind is elusive like the wind. How can he cross the path of kamagong? I tried to convince Grandpa Sutero. He did not allow it. He really won't allow it, Manuel. The kamagong arnis sticks are sacred. The kamagong sticks are almost connected to the history of this town. During the Spanish times, the kamagong sticks were already used in heroism. Manuel's grandfather was the first one who used them. And he killed numerous civil guards. The last mission of the kamagong was during the Japanese era. A Japanese executioner makes this town suffer. He rapes women, and murders almost all children and the elderly. What saddens me, is that the enemy of the kamagong now is one of us. The man who will hold the kamagong needs to be worthy. A man with a great mission. I want to learn how to use the arnis sticks, Manuel. I want to fly like a bird and land to the ground like a dry leaf while still holding the arnis sticks. I want to be worthy of the kamagong. Redonda. Double-cane. Abanico. Banda Y Banda. Rompida. Flicking. A strong wrist is the first key in holding the arnis sticks. Like a wild beast that should be tamed. These creaks and rage at the skilled hand. It is a weapon that is ready to kill. Are you ready? Yes. Tame the arnis sticks. Redonda. Redonda. Redonda. Manuel, like the last time. Rompida. It's cut in half. Just a moment, I'm going home. - Wait, wait a minute. - Why? Since you already disturbed our training, let's continue it. Aren't you the one who trained me before? Not me. It's Sutero. You should train him next. But, I'm cooking my rice. No, I'm still full. Ariel, like the last time. Redonda or Sinawali? Even if it's a combing style. Oh no, my nose got removed. My nose. It came back? Yes, it's still whole. Let's do it again. I think my nose got lost. Let's repeat it. Oh no, never mind. Forget that legend. Show your speed, Ariel. Block the grains of corn. What you showed Ariel is not even the one-tenth speed of Manuel. Show Ariel the truth of what I just said. We are only on the sixth rounding of the moon, Ariel. Your gut is strong now, Ariel and you're already fast. But you must first see, the ways that you must learn in a fight when you hold the kamagong. Ariel, you often hear that an arnis warrior must fly like a bird, and land to the ground like a dry leaf. And now you will see. That was amazing, Manuel. You can also do that if you will study it. Remember, Ariel. You only need two more cycles of the moon. I might be able to do it now. Stop your salutations. Just do the jump. You're like a Japanese soldier with that. Oh my goodness! One more. I did it! You did it but where are the sticks? What if I don't have the arnis sticks already? Holy Jesus! And what will you use as shield to the swings of your enemy? Your opponent's going to beat you non-stop. Ariel, don't show your annoyance. Have patience with the kid. He's in a hurry. Arnis couldn't be done in a hurry. I always visit you in your house. But they say you're always here in the clearing. They told me, that you're going away. That you are moving to another town. As long as I am here, I will just remember your brother. Your brother is always on my mind. It still hurts, Ariel. I'm training in handling the arnis sticks. I heard about it. And that now you're good at it. But still not worthy of the kamagong. You are just putting yourself in danger. You're the one who said that we should avenge for my brother's death. Yes, but you're just starting, Ariel. You don't stand a chance with Lorenzo. No. You'll see, I'll prove that I can fight Lorenzo and beat him in arnis. I'll be moving next week. If that's the case, you will not see how I will defeat Lorenzo in arnis. Many more days and full moons will still pass. But, okay I'll make sure to you, on the day that you are ready to defeat Lorenzo, I will come. I feel Lorenzo doesn't want to leave the minds of those two. Right, Manuel? Kill. Kill. Yahoo! It's finished. Chavez. Give it. Beautiful. Beautiful. See. Money is big in arnis, Beltran. And because Balbon came out of the light. The declared winner of this fight is the former champion. Lorenzo Montero. Wait, I'll be the one to massage you. - Like this. - Hmm… Lorenzo. Maharajah, huh? I thought your opponent is dead? All the teeth fell off with broken gums. Did you know that all my betting opponents had their thyroids went up to their throats? Oh, you. You made them so nervous. Especially when they heard that you killed someone in the province with arnis. Is that true, Lorenzo or just a rumor? Mr. Guevarra, if someone dies because of arnis the game becomes more popular. And who ever did it becomes more famous. Indeed. This gambling is a secret and illegal. And one more thing, our arnis have no rules. As they say, anything goes. A death is possible. - Your winnings. - Boss. Boss. What? When is my next fight? I should know it, right? So I could get half of my percentage. I already want to settle here in Manila. You should. You're the one who's an idiot. You keep on going back to that woman from the province. I don't think that she even lifted her skirt for you. What? Boss. I don't think like a hillbilly anymore. I now know that girls here are prettier. Yes. Sexy. Yes. Fragrant. Yes. Not like some girls in the province who smells sweaty and coconut oil. Coconut oil? That's only during my ancestors. Smells like a native shampoo. And I only go home there to practice. Because there are a lot of arnisadores in our town. That are nice to practice with. Yes. This so-called kamagong... Who is this that they call the "Kamagong"? It's Manuel. I see. Also an enthusiast. I see. But we haven't fought yet. His best friend is the one I killed. I see. And perhaps because of that, I might not be able to face him in a fight. Kamagong, huh? Sounds good. Hey, you might be testing me. I will buy all the rice cakes here. - Rufo is full of jokes. - Jokes? Eat. It looks delicious. Hey Rufo, it looks like you won in jueteng, and you've been treating people with food here. Rufo is just showing off to his soon daughter-in-law. Right, Rufo? If I am just showing off I am going to buy this whole store. But why do you still need to buy it when this will soon be your son's? Just a business partner. - Soon to be his wife, a business partner? - Ouch! Asshole! Hey, she knows how to use the sticks. She's been taught how. I was just teasing. Ouch! Oh my, that hurts! Eat, my friend. - It's Mr. Chavez. - Right. - It's already late. - Good evening, Mr. Chavez. Rufo. Go ahead and eat. We've been waiting for you the men are here too. I'm not supposed to go since it's already late. But I have great news for you. He has good news. Your men are very lucky. They all got in for Saudi Arabia. We got in! Their flight is next month. Did you hear that, Manuel? You heard that? You're all accepted. You'll be earning dollars. With my perseverance, I did it. How about you, Ariel? Don't you intend to go to Saudi? They will call me Don Dencio now. If I become an expert in arnis, it's like I've been to ten Saudi's already. I don't have a wife here that will be left that can be taken by the gluttons. Captain, Do you trust those men? You know these villagers want to earn dollars. But, I already agreed. Only 500 dollars a month will be given to your men. Mr. Chavez, 500 dollars? That's big already multiplied by 20. That's thousands of pesos already. Don't go anymore, Manuel. Why? Aren't you happy with that? I will become a Saudi boy already. Melissa is just pretending that she doesn't want to. But the truth is, she doesn't want Manuel to go. I mean, big brother. Shut up, Belen or else I'm going to hit you with that grinder. Why don't you hit me instead? So I can not go to Saudi anymore. Inform your men to prepare an additional of 10,000 pesos. Huh? That's big, 10,000? But if you are struggling we can postpone their departure. Maybe in the next month or in March if there's still a vacancy. Six. Ready. Esteban. One. Two. Boss? Three. In which forest did you catch those baboons? They are my allies. Five. They are hold-uppers of taxi. - But, sir, they are fearless. - Six. Skilled in carrying guns and used to killing people. Seven. Esteban. Eight. What we are talking about is arnis. And not hold-up. What I think of them… Are sugar cane choppers. Sakadas. There's a show. Who are they? Lorenzo I got some people for you to practice on. Just like in boxing, they are punching bags. Beat them. Break their bones. If they die. Don't worry. And as for what you asked me. I'll do what I can do. So I can bring the kamagong. Lorenzo, offer him 10,000 or up to 20,000. The important thing is for us to get the kamagong arnis sticks so you can use them. Six. It's like I can see now. Seven. When you finally have the kamagong arnis sticks, the stakes will be higher. Eight. Don't worry. If I need to break Sutero's hands, I'll do it. Ten. Almost all of my livelihoods are gone. I sold my house and lot. The buffalo, goat, and cow that I own are gone too. Can you imagine, they are asking me if I still have things that I can pawn? Well, I said if I can pawn girlfriend. But he doesn't want to accept because it might go on foreclosure. Dencio, you'll just get a girlfriend who doesn't know how to take a bath. That's not true, captain. She takes a bath, but only on Saturdays. Who's this? Well, well, well. Who's this? Is this also my customer? It's Lorenzo. Oh, it's Lorenzo. So arrogant. How is everyone? Looks like you're all having fun. Belen. I heard that Ariel is diligent in his arnis training. Just assist him, okay? So his arnis sticks would not wear out. Melissa? How is your rice cake? Is it still hot? Or Manuel consumed it all. Do not get mad. I just want to have a snack. Melissa, where is the bolo? Belen, let's go inside. Why, Dencio? Are you going to hack me? No, no. I have to cleave this coconut. Melissa needs it for her rice cake. You don't need a bolo. What? Let's go. It split. How's Manila? Good. It's easy to get rich. Sutero will be happy for you. Because of all that he trained for arnis de mano. You became successful. He'll be happy. It split. It split. I did not teach you arnis to make money out of it, Lorenzo. I trained you to have a sharp mind, good physique, be respectful even when fighting. Grandpa, what will I do here? Plant rice on a piece of land? And harvest once a year. We're just going to get better if we use the skill in arnis. The use of skills in almost killing each of your opponent, Lorenzo? The news reached me, you are known as the executioner of arnis in Manila. That is why I want to change that reputation. And I can only do that if you will give me the kamagong. The kamagong. The kamagong is for the best player of arnis. Grandpa Sutero, I believe that I should have that honor. How sure are you? Is there anyone here in Mabolo that will challenge me? Ten thousand pesos, Grandpa Sutero. In exchange for the kamagong. The kamagong has no equal value. Grandpa Sutero, I will not go back to Manila unless I have those. Lorenzo, now I regret that I taught you. You don't have the slightest respect for arnis. I need those. Grandpa Sutero. Don't force me forget that you are my uncle. Lorenzo! Prove that you are really worthy of the ironwood. You are already old, Grandpa Sutero. Ouch! That hurts, ouch! Leave, Lorenzo. Forget that I'm your uncle. From now on, don't come back here. Go away, leave! Leave! Go! I'm going to have that ironwood soon. Is that right, old man? Give me those! - I said give it to me. - You won't get it. Give it to me! You don't want to? You won't? Give it to me. If not, I will break all your bones, old man! - Give them. - I don't want to. - Give them. - I don't want to. Give them. Are you going to give those to me? Or will I have to kill you, old man? You can kill me but the kamagong can't be yours. Is that so? - Rock… - Manuel, Manuel. Master Sutero is being beaten by Lorenzo. - Where? - In his house. Poor old man. Wait, I'll join you. Why is it? I don't know. There's Master Sutero! What happened to you, Master Sutero? That animal wants to get the kamagong. That's enough, Manuel. I surrender, I won't fight anymore. I don't ever want to see your face in this town. Yes, Manuel. Manuel! Do not interfere! Let's go. Come. Can you get up now, Master Sutero? I can, I can. I feel better now. How's Manuel? How are his bruises? He wasn't hit that much. The truth is, he's worried about you. He's outside. I want to talk to him. About the ironwood. What are you trying to prove? Should all men commit suicide just to prove their skill in arnis? He uses arnis the wrong way. Lorenzo is an executioner. And anyone who believes in the gallant tradition should revolt against it. Tradition? Is that more important than life? Will you just throw away your life just to keep a tradition going? You don't understand it. I really don't understand why all of you are willing to commit suicide just for the sake of continuing your tradition. What now, Ariel? Even Manuel got hurt because of Lorenzo. He's really bad. Be careful, okay? If they just didn't have a gun earlier, I could've finished him already. Yeah! I was supposed to grab the ironwood in Maestro Sutero's hands. But the gun was pointing at us. I just held back. That bastard is really a cheater. How can he beat Manuel in a fist fight? He just threw mud in his eyes. That son of a bitch! Ironwood? That's what I'm supposed to grab earlier. You have a mission to do, Manuel. The arnis should be saved. Against the people who are disgracing the sport. Use this. The ironwood. Why did he give it to Manuel? You're the one who has something against Lorenzo! It should be yours. My god, Belen. You'll just provoke him. It should really be for Ariel, but it was given to Manuel. But who knows, Manuel might give it to you. Keep in mind, Manuel, more than strength and courage are needed to be eligible to handle the kamagong. Most of all, a clean intention and fighting for a cause. Faster. A little faster. Manuel, Manuel! Manuel, our ten thousand pesos got lost. Look at this newspaper. That's why that animal looks like that, he's a swindler. He sold all the houses, lands, and animals of the people here. Where's dad? Does he know? He's there. His blood pressure got high because of shame. I got suspicious. Ariel, the horse. Hey, Rufo. I have all their visas. Let's go to your house so we can exchange now. We agreed on cash on delivery, right? When I bring their visas, they will give me the balance of their fees. Not visa, Chavez. You will be the one to pay us. You should return our ten thousand pesos that you got from each of us before. And eat the visas that you were talking about. Wait, wait, I don't understand you. I guess you read the news. Don't fall for it! The reporter who's angry at me made it up. All made up? 200 cases? Chavez, we don't want to add our lawsuit against you. And one more thing, I don't want to be embarrassed from the people here. So return all our money now! Well, if that is your decision I cannot do anything about it. I will return all your money. But you need to go to Manila, and I will give it in my office. You took them here, you return them here. Rufo, we're in the mountains, in which bank should I get the money? Ask your men to go back to Manila. When they have money and are back here, you can leave. For now, Chavez, you will stay here. Don't turn your back on me, - I'm talking to you. - I'll take care of you first. Are you trying to escape? Men, stop them. Dad, Rufo was shot. Let's go. Enough! Stop it now. Take charge here. I'm going to the camp. His men did it, Manuel. Our case is not just fraud anymore, now, it's murder. What will happen to us now? If you're going to ask me, We all have the same problem now. The important thing now is we get out of this place. Taber, it's Manuel. He's following us. What? Drive faster. Faster. Hurry up. He's going catch us. Hey, drive faster. You have to hurry. If he catches us, I will shoot you. Drive faster! - Where is he? - Why are you asking me? You, look at it. He's hanging on the side. Hey, push him to the wires. To the wires! - There, Manuel just fell. - Where? There. Run! - We got a flat tire, Taber. - What? Why did you park it here? This is a worthless van! Enough! Get out! You drive like a jackass! You're careless, dumb-ass! That's enough. Let's go to the forest. Go ahead. Let's go. Okay, men. On the double. Move! Take them. Move on the double! Wait, wait, wait. What are they going to do with us? We are in danger with the one who's following us. Let's take the girl and make her our hostage. - Run, Belen they are bad people! - What? Come here. Let go of me. Hey, she's running! Hold her tight. You shameless bastards! Put me down. Captain Simon! Captain Simon! Belen was taken by armed men. There in the mountain. Okay, men. Let's go there. Dad, what if something bad happens to Belen? What are those gunshots that I heard? - What happened? - Rufo was shot. Why are there so many people? Where is Manuel? He chased them. The military is there too. Why did they only kill one devil? They also took Belen. Ariel! Get the ironwood from Sutero's! Faster! Where are you taking me? - Let go of me. - Taber. What? Maybe you're tired. - I can carry her for you. - Put me down. No need, you might drop and take advantage of her. Where do you think we are now? We're not from here, and you're asking me? What he means is we should be heading towards the city so we could get a vehicle. And escape right away. Ouch! Ouch, ouch! That's all we want. Because if we did not pass this way, I'm sure that the military has seen us already. Because we've been reported. Don't fight anymore. You are our hostage here. But in Manila, you'll be our hostess. Taber! A horse. Hey, both of you go there. Catch it. Follow them. Faster. Doy? Imbo? Where's the horse? Doy? Imbo? Let's play, kid. Let's play, kid. Okay, shorty. Let's play. This is now for real, kid. This is now for real, old man. Sarge! We will go this way. Go that way. Okay, men. What are you smiling at? - Put it down. - Go, put that down. - Where are the others? - I don't know. Hey, check what's happening there. Taber, another enemy on that side. Go there, follow him. Join them. Let me go... How about us? You keep on asking, - it's up to you! - Ariel! Stay there. I will just go home. Don't take me anymore. You're not going. You'll be my protection. Come here. Come. Take them. Yes, sir. Stand up. Manuel! Manuel, they took Belen that way. Let's go. You said it's Manuel? Let's go. Manuel they are carrying a long and a short one. How are we going to fight them? Where? They're just here, right? - Ariel, we're right here! - Come. Ariel, help me. Ariel! - I said come here. - Ariel! Ariel! - Shut up! - Ariel! Are you not going to stop? Want this? Then shut your mouth! Shut up! Come. Just let me go. - Ariel, we're right here! - Are you not going to stop? I will blast your mouth! Ariel. Let it go. Put your gun down. I'll blast your brain. Don't kill anyone, Ariel. But he's going to kill us. Did you see how big his gun is? You might go to hell. Then let's not kill him. Go ahead, move. - Let's kill him. - Don't. - Let's kill him. - Don't. You animal! Evil! You're the one who's going to hell. That's enough. You might kill him. - You, you! - Belen, that's enough. - You'll go to hell too with that. - Let me go. You're coming with me. You will be responsible for what your boss did. Ouch! Hi, Lorenzo. Lorenzo is so handsome. Wow! That's it. Come here. Wait, what are you doing? Don't throw me. The water is so cold. You're too heavy! 500! Call. - It's a pity, Chavez. - I'm out. It ended with the idiots. Now they're gawking in Muntinlupa. Good thing there's the Constitutional Convention because if not, they could've gotten a death sentence. Hey! Chavez is wearisome, Guevarra. You spent all his capital already, in betting for the gambling of arnis. He's become excessive in deceiving those applicants - in the recruitment agency. - Well, well. Why blame me for everything? They should blame Lorenzo. Because he knocked down all of Chavez's men. That's why it's natural that all of Chavez's investments go down. Look at Lorenzo. It's like you have a gold mine in Lorenzo right, Guevarra? Flushes. The problem with you, Beltran if you will just gamble in arnis, you'll burst your bladders out in laughing. I already told you. You're contented in Jai Alai. So how it is now? There is no more Jai Alai? Huh? Break, let's take a break. If you no longer have cash, I can accept cheques. No, no. Let's take a break. So? I have something to confess to you, Guevarra. What? Since you are forcing me to gamble in arnis. Well, Beltran, if you're planning to steal Lorenzo from me, we will be smashing each other's balls. No, no, Guevarra. You got Lorenzo in Mabolo town. That's where I'm sure to get one too. Be ready with your bet. And who are you going to get there? The Kamagong? Boss, he won't. He doesn't want to. That Kamagong is a snob. I thought he knows how to communicate well. He's an uneducated person. When we talked before, he answered right away. Damn him! Maybe not, Mr. Beltran. It just so happened that his father just passed away. If that happens to you, of course, you'll not be happy. He doesn't want a hundred thousand pesos? And rejected it? Just for one arnis fight against Lorenzo. A hundred thousand? Wait, wait, who's that? Stop it, stop it. Superior! Superior! Good morning to you. Very well, very well. What do you need? We are practicing. Don't disturb us. Maybe it is not bad to… Admire. I am Cenon Beltran. I just want to meet and be friends with the people here in Mabolo. Especially you. You are so great in arnis. I want to offer you to play that in Manila. How about Lorenzo? Do you know that criminal? They said that he plays arnis in Manila. Lorenzo? Lorenzo is the richest player of arnis. And he hasn't lost yet. And now, the news has spread that no one could ever beat him. Ariel Salgado, sir. I am not a recruiter like Chavez. The only reason why I got interested in this place is because of Lorenzo's arrogance. Who's a criminal, according to you. Right? I thought that if he is from this place, I will also find a match against him here. You. In your opinion, Mr. Beltran. Can I now be a match against Lorenzo? It's in your form. It's in your moves. Your only disadvantage is your youth. But a hard disadvantage. They will all be surprised. The ten roundings of the moon are not over yet, Ariel. You have not fully accomplished the flying like a bird. And swaying in the air like a dry leaf. I'm sorry. But Lorenzo is the reason why I am training for arnis. My dream is to get the ironwood. My mission was to suppress Lorenzo's cruelty. And this is my chance. Superior. This kid is a great speaker. Firm. I can tell as early as now, Lorenzo's going down. Ariel! You suddenly made a decision. You even desecrated the ironwood! - Give that to me! - No! I need to face him. He has a debt to repay. Now, if you want to help me you have to lend me the ironwood! You facing Lorenzo is a suicide, Ariel. You have not yet completed your training period. I'm strong! Stable. What do I still need? Clean heart. Sharp mind. If only endurance and strength are needed to be worthy of the ironwood, even Lorenzo has the right. But the hardness of the flesh and the strength of the knee alone is not enough. I don't want to think what might happen to you in the hands of Lorenzo. Just don't think about it. I am not a coward. I'm a man, unlike you. If the little boy becomes naughty sometimes you need to beat his ass. Even if you don't give me the ironwood, I will face Lorenzo. Ariel's decision is still part of his mission. Justice is still what he wants. However… You're right. He is not yet ready for the ironwood. The time is insufficient for him to come to the end of his mission. Lorenzo is the boundary of his mission. You're saying that he is not ready yet and still lacks time. How will he defeat Lorenzo? Each mission is a steep mountain and a wide sea that should be climbed and traversed by the follower of arnis. Only at the time of the fight, your question will be answered. Hey! We better leave. Manuel, maybe Ariel will win if you are there. That's what dad and Master Sutero said. Ariel is so aggressive, that's why you need to be at his side during his fight. He left without saying goodbye to me. Until now I am still waiting. Looks like he's not coming back. Oh, Belen with beauty like yours, he will never forget about you. There's no young girl who looks like you in Manila. Aside from you being good in grinding, your rice cake is huge. - Dencio? - Oh, sorry. What I mean is, the rice cakes that you cook are big and delicious. Oh, this mouth is just saying the truth. Belen, I'm just trying to cheer you up. Don't be sad. Because with my age, I might make you happy. Oh, Dencio? Are you going to Manila? Because it's Ariel's fight this Sunday. That's the news from Lorenzo's friends. Manuel will decide on that. It seems like there's a problem. But I think that he will not neglect the kid. If you're going, Dencio, I will join you, okay? I still have some money here. I'll take care of our fare in the bus. It's settled. That's okay. Belen? What? Let me take a pinch of your rice cake. - What? - I mean, this. What's your decision now? Are you going to Manila? Even the Elders that's what their request to me. In my opinion even if I resent Ariel, I should just set it aside. Friends. He's nothing! In a few moments now, we will witness the biggest fight of the year in the field of arnis. Introducing. From the stable of Mr. Cenon Beltran. He's nothing! A new face in the field of arnis the new and the young Ariel Salgado. And the current champion. The champion of the champions. The arnis master. The undefeated. The executioner. The pride in the stable of Mr. Guevarra. The champion, the true champion, Lorenzo Montero. Macho Lorenzo! Boo! Macho Lorenzo! And the judge Mr. Esteban Padilla. That's Mr. Guevarra's man. Wait a minute, wait a minute. What is this, Guevarra? Isn't Esteban on your payroll? Beltran, I fired him yesterday. I don't care about him anymore. He's a professional referee. Then, it's up to him. Mr. Beltran! Only the fighters will be at the center, please step aside. Salgado. Montero. The two of you will fight the gallant's way. Whoever goes beyond the light and lets go of the arnis, will lose. No complaints. Whatever I say is final. Do you understand? Fight! Duck, Ariel. Be careful, Ariel. Duck, Ariel. Silencio! Oh no, Captain can we stop them? Belen, stop first. Ariel might get hit more. Stand up, Ariel. You can do it. Get up and fight. Go, Ariel. Go! Hit him more, Ariel. We are being cheated! I already told you Lorenzo that I don't like losing. If you lose, I will put you under the sun and roast you alive! Hit him! Fly! That's the equivalent of not completing the rest of the training. Your opponent's weak. You better finish him. Manuel, help him. Manuel, help Ariel. Stop Lorenzo. Manuel. The kid might not make it. Prove your competence not on a kid. Deal with me. I'm challenging you from this moment on. Every hour, I'll wait for you on the hill. And if you are a true warrior in arnis, you will come. You will not get bored in waiting, Manuel. I'll bring you down the hill a loser. A corpse. Let's bring him to the hospital. Let's bring him to the hospital. Friends. The winner the reigning champion Lorenzo. Dencio, is he just going to wait all day? What if Lorenzo doesn't come? Lorenzo will show up because he challenged him. Manuel didn't want Lorenzo to come and he's not at the ridge. It's good that you get to see him. Unlike, Ariel ever since he lost the fight he's just staying at home. It seems that he doesn't want people to see him including me. Holy saints, Belen! How is that kid going to show up? His face is full of bruises and of course his flesh and bones are tired how can he go down his house? They say that you're ashamed? That's why you always want to be alone? Ariel, give your mind some rest and your body. You've neglected everything. I have a bigger reason now, Belen. Before… The only thing I feel towards Lorenzo is anger. Now… Are you going to believe, Belen that I see him every hour? He's scaring me. Laughing at me. And my brother, Emilio is furious, screaming from his grave. Blaming me. Why did I not defeat Lorenzo? Why did I fail? Why did I use arnis for my revenge? Why not through a knife? Why not with a gun? Why is Lorenzo still alive? - Why is Lorenzo still alive? - Ariel? - Why is Lorenzo still alive? - Ariel, that's enough. Why is Lorenzo still alive? You will forget everything, Ariel. We are all here. I am here. Right, Ariel? Right? I promise, Manuel I will finish in the right time. I will give myself a chance to hold the ironwood again. In the right time, and according to tradition. And this is what I'll promise to you, I'll be the one to hand the ironwood to you. Whoever wants to be an expert in the sticks ought to be as hard as the ironwood. Won't be able to feel the beatings in all of his body. Even if the whole body gets filled with blood and injury. Kamagong. Kamagong. Lorenzo. Is this needed in arnis? Manuel and I will fight. All will be used. Arnis. Punch. And kick. Because that's the information that I got. Kamagong fights that way. Seems like you got a lot of respect for that Kamagong, Lorenzo? For you to prepare like this. This warehouse is too small. Compared to the hill. Like with the previous battles here. In comparison to my scheduled encounter with Kamagong, I don't want to give him an opportunity. I want him to kneel immediately. Crawl. And go down that hill a corpse. That's why many months have passed that you don't want to accept any fight here in Manila. At one point in a man's life, comes the biggest fight of his life. And that is what I am preparing for. Kamagong and I will clash. At the Mabolo town festival. In front of almost all of our citizens. I'm going to break a tradition. A mission. The town will forget a legend. That when arnis is uttered they will not worship Kamagong but the name Lorenzo. Lorenzo Montero. Sir. I noticed that Lorenzo had a different attitude in training. I'm skeptical that he is nervous. Your allies that are bank robbers. I have a new task for them. Melissa. We'll go ahead, okay? Okay. Manuel. Manuel. I brought you your food. Manuel. You've been waiting day and night. What if Lorenzo doesn't come? Aren't you getting tired? Exhaustion is not important. The important thing is the tradition of the mission. When Lorenzo arrives, and I'm not here it's a disgrace to all men of Mabolo. I hope you understand me, Melissa. Fine. Here, you can eat now. Manuel, can I disturb your food and your conversation? Take the arnis sticks, hurry! Give me those! Stay here. Don't fight anymore. Manuel, before you face Lorenzo, Before you prove your ability in arnis. Show your girlfriend first, that you are not afraid of the ironwood. No matter how much is blocked in front of you. Prove it, Manuel that you can overcome those arnis sticks. Like a warrior, whose feet are flat on the ground. You. I don't want him to get any bruises. All the beating will be on the body. - Okay, let's start this. - No! Manuel! Have mercy on him. That's enough! Run, Manuel! That's enough! Have mercy on him. Manuel! That's enough. Manuel! Please stop! That's enough! You shameless bastards! Demons! Manuel… Your face is still clean, Manuel. No stains, no bruises. But you'll lose a face to the people of Mabolo. If your balls recede and don't show up tomorrow. Remember, Manuel that you're the one who challenged Lorenzo. You said that you'll wait for him day and night at the hill. So even if you have broken bones, you should show up in the duel. And Manuel if you turn into a coward, how's the mission of the ironwood? Let's go. Manuel? Lorenzo will win. Lorenzo's my bet. Get in. You can come out after the fight. Go ahead. Old man, you are no longer needed there. There are a lot of judges there already. Capt. Simon, you'll be the referee? They couldn't find Master Sutero. He suddenly disappeared. Hello! Let's go in the booth. Take care of the boss. Give him a glass. The snobbish geezers. Where's my opponent? Still not here? He said, Lorenzo that he will wait day and night. He might be arriving tonight. Why is Manuel still not here? He's coming. He will. Well, it's Manuel. I told you he's coming. Manuel! Beat him! We're on Manuel's side! Manuel, we thought you're not coming. Did you warm up? That's why you're late? Sir, looks like it didn't affect him. 50 arnisadors, with random hits. Not suffering? Idiot! Lorenzo, he will not last long. Go on! Long live, Manuel! Lorenzo. Manuel. You will fight in the name of arnis de mano. All the teachings of Master Sutero are the rules that you will follow. Let the fight begin. Bets for Manuel. Sir, there are new bets for Manuel from the people here in Mabolo. They can bet all they want. Tell them, they can even bet their carabaos. - Record it. - Yes, sir. It's all set. I know them. Those guys were in the warehouse in Manila. Those are the gamblers of arnis. Hit him, Manuel. Hit him. - Go, Manuel. - Finish him. Sir, Beltran's group is here and they bet on Manuel's. Call. Record it again. Ten is to four. This is big money for us, sir. I thought this Kamagong is good? Oh no, sister. Manuel already has a lot of injuries in his face. Melissa, you know that women are not allowed here! Go ahead Tano, bring them down. Dad, he was kidnapped last night. He was beaten up by Lorenzo's group. Dad, stop the fight. There's nothing that I can do. The fight will only stop if the arnis sticks are no longer in Manuel's hands. Manuel! Lorenzo, hit him! Just give up, Manuel. Let them be. There! He caught it! The fight is finished. He released the sticks. Cheater! Ariel, the ravine. The lightning won't strike twice at the same place. What happened to Emilio will no longer happen to Manuel. You're a cheater, Lorenzo. Son of a bitch! Fly like a bird. And land to the ground like a dry leaf. The fight is over, Lorenzo. I'm still holding my arnis, Manuel. - Esteban. - Sir? We can lose in arnis. But not in money. You know that. Finish him now! This is the time to run! Boss, Guevarra's running away. Chase him! My money! The duel is finished. That's enough. May you be gallant in the fight, Lorenzo. Yes, Manuel. Yes. You're making a gamble out of arnis. We'll discuss this at the bar an gay hall. Arrest them. Wait, but we won? Run! Let's go to the left. Wait, wait. One pinch from each of the people here, Guevarra will be smashed. Manuel! Traitor! My eyes! My eyes! Thank you, Manuel. My brother will now rest in peace. I have now avenged the death of my brother. Do you remember what I told you? I'm the one who will transfer these sticks to your hands. Accept it.
