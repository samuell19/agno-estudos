- Good morning, Mr. Everett. - Good morning, Anna. Is Mrs. Drummond ready to see me? Mr. Everett, I let her sleep late. I hope you don't mind. As long as I can get back to Chicago by 12. You go in and sit down. I'll take her breakfast up right now. Fine, fine, thank you. Oh, Anna, there's such a lovely piece in the paper about poor Mr. Drummond. Listen. "The funeral yesterday of Paul Drummond... ...prominent young business executive, saddened many... ...especially those who remembered his brilliant athletic career... ...at Northwestern." - Where's the bacon? In the warming oven. "Of late years, he was prominently connected... ...with the Indian Hill Hunt Club... ...which is noted for its splendid athletic records." Good morning, Anna. It's about time. I thought you'd forgot. - How's the missus? - She's all right. Think she'll want anything special today? I think she'll want us to go on just the way we always do. Good morning, Mrs. Drummond. Good morning, Anna. How nice the tray looks. It's cooked just the way you like it. You will eat some, won't you? Thank you, Anna. Put it on the table. All right, Mrs. Drummond. I better put some cold water on my face. Oh, my eyes feel all gritty. Mr. Everett's downstairs. It's after 10. Oh, Anna, you shouldn't have let me sleep so long. There's such a lot to do... But there isn't, is there? Nothing to do at all. What shall I tell Mr. Everett? I'll eat my breakfast downstairs with him so we won't waste his time. All right, Mrs. Drummond. Mrs. Drummond will be right down. - Where are the boys? - I kept them out of the house. You know how noisy kids are. Hello, Frank. I'm sorry to be late. Only a few minutes. Anna, let's not have quite so many flowers in here. Makes such a sickly smell. Yes, Mrs. Drummond. Oh, please, don't stand, Frank. It's just that I don't feel like sitting. - Would you like some coffee? - No, thank you, Jess. How neat you are, Frank. That's what comes of being a bachelor all your life. Paul never picked up anything. That was always one of my wifely duties... ...hanging up his clothes. Jess, do you feel equal to going over these papers? Of course I do. Please don't baby me. Is everything all right? Well, in the main, yes. Paul left things in as good shape as he could... ...considering he was ill for so long. Can the boys still go away to school as Paul planned? Paul took care of that with a trust for their education. Of course, that money could be used for other purposes. No, I wanna do it the way Paul planned. The only thing I'd hate would be giving up Anna. I feel responsible for her. She's been with me so long. Well, you can keep Anna, but I suggest you let Dave and Mary go. I'll do whatever you say. Jess, this has nothing to do with the money end of it. But don't you think you'll find it difficult to keep on here? So many memories. Memories aren't as painful as people say. This came four days ago. Paul sent it special delivery. It's for you. Frank, I... I wanna read it to you. You were fond of Paul. "My darling Jess, it seems strange to be writing this to you... ...for you will be reading it when I am no longer with you. We've shared so much together all these years... ...that I can't think of you without me. Bring up the boys to stand alone. Don't let people dictate what you shall do or shall not do... ...because it would be impossible for you to do anything... ...which is not fine and decent and true. As far as my part of your future is concerned... ...I read a poem somewhere once that said: Better by far you should forget and smile Than you should remember and be sad Thanks, Jess, for being my wife. Your loving but unpoetic husband, Paul." I... All right, leave it there. You wanna race? - Beat you to the door. - Bet you can't. Beat you, beat you, beat you. - Oh, hello, Uncle Frank. - Good morning, Uncle Frank. Hello, Kim. - Keith. - Hi. Oh, hello, Mother, we didn't know you were here. We thought you'd still be asleep. Not much chance of that with you two in the house. We expected you down to watch us swim. I had some business to talk over. Going to the ball game this afternoon? When do I have a chance to go to a ball game? - I'd sure like to see it. - Me too. Cubs are playing the Dodgers. Now, now, boys, not today. Gee, I forgot. We're sorry. Why don't you go if you want to? Today? Well, Grandmother said... That you should stay with me? We like to be with you, Mom. Thanks. I like to be with you too. But we have lots of time to be together, and ball games don't happen every day. Go on. Tell me all about it afterwards the way you did with Dad. You? Why, you don't even know what team Joe DiMaggio played for. You see? Say, can we go pretty soon? You better start right now. There's not enough gas to drive. We'd rather go on a train anyway. Come on, if you're coming. Okay. You sure you don't mind, Mom? No, run along. Have fun. - Come on, Keith. - Okay, I'm coming. You've done a fine job with those boys. It was two-thirds Paul. Couldn't you please stay for lunch? I wish I could, Jess, but I have a board meeting at 12. I must be getting back. Could you join me for supper tonight? I'd be happy to come out here again if you wish. Thank you. This is our regular night at Mother's. - Promise me you won't worry? - I'll try not to. If you have any problems at all, no matter how trivial they might seem... ...please call me. I'll call you anyway, Frank. By the way, what about a cab? Oh, no, thanks, I think I'll walk. The exercise will do me good. It's Mother. Oh, dear, I'm not dressed. Well, you look perfectly dressed to me. Oh, not to Mother. Bye, Jess. - Good morning. - Good morning, Mrs. Kimball. - How is my girl? - She's fine. There she is. Jessica, come out and see Mrs. Thompson for a moment. I see Frank got you up. I know. Anna let me sleep too long. Good morning, Mrs. Thompson. Good morning, my dear. I hope you don't mind my telling you what a lovely service it was. Dr. Burrows spoke beautifully, I thought, and the church was simply exquisite. Yes, it was very well-arranged. Stella, you might recall, it's only yesterday. Thank you for telling me. Wouldn't you like to come inside with Mother? No. Ralph is going to take her to the Ration Board. She's having a fearful time. Her car only gets nine miles to the gallon. They're doing everything they can to break our spirit. It's pure class prejudice. Are you leaving now, Frank? Ralph will take you down to the station. Ralph, drop Mr. Everett at the station. - Yes, ma'am. - Mary, I don't have to go to the Board. Now, Stella, don't be spineless. Stick to your rights. This is still America, I hope. I'll call you later about my income tax, Frank. Come, dear. My poor child, you look simply awful. You'd have done better to have remained in bed. Speaking of bed, you shouldn't wander about in a dressing gown. - What must Frank think? - Mother, I am fully clothed. It's the idea of it. You're so innocent, you don't understand others' minds don't run the same. Frank is a gentleman, but he's also a man. - But, Mother... - I stopped by for more black stockings. And I got the perfect veil for you. You'll need several, of course. - Where are you going? - We can talk while I'm dressing. You allow Anna to walk over you. There's dust on this banister. Really, Mother, what time have any of us had to dust banisters? Hello, Grandma. We've gotta have some money, Mom. Go ask Anna for some change. - Where are you going? - Ball game. On this day? I should think you'd be ashamed, boys. Mother, please don't. It's okay, Mom. We're sorry. Come on, Kim, let's feed the dogs. Allowing them to go to a ball game. They like it, they always went with Paul. People like to do a great many things they don't do, Jessica. I could see they were dying to go. It isn't a question of their wanting. It's the way it would've looked. They're too young to have their lives changed by their father's death. They've adjusted themselves very well so far. Going to the ball game was part of that adjustment. I would call it wanting in feeling. You don't know boys, you only had a girl. I'm sure I never interfered with the normal pattern of your life. Well, this is the only black thing in here. It's wool. You'll have to hurry and decide... ...which of your summer things you want dyed. I don't wanna wear black. Not wear black? - But you must. Have you forgotten...? - Don't say that, Mother. My dear child, you are a widow. Nobody understand better than I what that means. You must learn to accept it. People don't have to wear it anymore. Our kind of people wear black. Please don't insist on it, Mother. I know you've always worn it. I suppose you like it... Like it? Why, how can you say such a thing? Have you no respect for the memory of your father? It has been 25 years. I shall wear it until the day I die. I don't understand you at all... ...knowing how deeply I feel about a thing like this. Quarreling with me on this day of all days. I see. I'm sorry, Mother. I can't wear black. I'll do anything you want, but not that. - Giving in to whims. - All right, call it a whim. A psychologist would call it a phobia because that's what it is. I've learned to loathe it. The very thought stifles me. It's right for you, perhaps, but it isn't for me. Please, let's not discuss it anymore. I'm sorry I blew up, Mother. Won't you stay here for lunch? I think not. Getting angry over such a small thing. Obviously, I'm a disturbing influence. Naturally, I expect you and the boys to dinner tonight at the usual time. Yes, Mother. Good afternoon. What can I do for you? Hello, Al. Have you any weenies and cold ham? Weenies at this time of day? Oh, no. Oh, Kim is so crazy about them. We're having a farewell picnic. They leave for school tomorrow. Will he settle for bologna and cold ham? All right, a pound each. Pound? You'll have enough leftover for a regiment. You don't know my boys. Think the boys'll make the team at Northwestern like Mr. Drummond? - Kim will, I think. - Twenty-four points, a dollar 38. There you are. Thanks, Al. Oh, just a moment. I'm in this for a living, you know. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Thank you. Tell the kids goodbye for me. I will. - Why, Jess, hello. - Hello, Riette. - Yes, dear. How are you? - Hello, Baby. What have you been doing with yourself? I've been giving my extra time to Nurses Aide. Have you heard the latest dirt? I'm in an awful hurry, Baby. I have to pick up the boys... Oh, you've got to hear it. You'll die. Come over here, dear, and let me tell you. Phyllis is back from Reno and she's playing around like mad. None of us will speak to her if she keeps it up. Poor Phyll. She's on the rebound. Poor Phyll, my eye. She was a fool to divorce Jack. She's going to find herself a drug on the market with those two kids. Tactful Tillie, we always call her. I'm in an awful hurry. I'll see you soon. Hey, Jess, you come right over here and let me have a good look at you. Hello, George. I just saw Riette in the market. That's right. Bring my wife into the conversation. - You're a sight for sore eyes. - I'm a sight, all right. I'm in a hurry. I have to pick up the boys. Oh, you've got a second to talk to an old friend. The gang misses you, Jess. - I've missed you all too. - There's a remedy for that. Stop by for a drink. It'll be like old times. - I can't tonight. - You haven't changed. I look a thousand years old, but you're sweet to say so. You always look good to me, baby. Come on, George, let me go. I really have to run. All right, but you call us real soon or we'll call you. All right, George. Guess what we're having for our picnic. Bologna and cold ham. Oh, boy, I could eat a bear. - Angel cake too? - With frosting. I fixed you some baked summer squash with cheese on it. Again? The point of having a Victory Garden is to eat what grows in it. I wish it had been the squash that died instead of the peas. Look, there's somebody in the driveway. Hey, look. Hi, everybody. Hello, Mrs. Drummond. We've been waiting here for ages. We wanted Kim and Keith to come to the club for a party. Hello, Kim. Hello, Keith. I've got a houseguest with me. She's cute. You'll be nuts about her, Keith. She's a little older than I am, but she'll be just exactly right for you. I know you don't mind having Bill Hawks, Kim. We're using the Hawks' membership. Dad said... ...I've been running up such awful bills for ginger ale. Gee, it sound terrific, Gretchen, but we're having a party here with Mother. Oh, nonsense. Run along if you want to. - What's her name? - Penny Boardman. She's absolutely darling and she's gonna stay a whole month. Oh, please come. Well, maybe we can ditch Droopy after supper. - Is it okay, Mom? - Go ahead, have fun. Gosh, that's marvelous. I mean, it's just super. Thanks, Mrs. Drummond. Come on, Kim. Sure it's all right, Mom? Of course. I'll go to a movie. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye, Mom. - Bye-bye. - Goodbye, Kim. Don't forget to write. - Fat chance of me forgetting. - You'll be home for Christmas? - Oh, sure. Bye, Penny. So long. Bye. - Wasn't it swell? - You bet. Oh, Mom, we thought you'd gone to the show. No, I was too tired. - Did you have fun? - I'll say. Boy, we sure pulled a fast one on Droopy. Yeah, but he's gonna be here and you're not. I bet you wish you weren't going away. Droopy? Gretchen thinks he's a pill. Oh, yeah? You're not sorry to be leaving them, are you? Who's sorry? Because it's still not too late to cancel your tuition. Gee, I'm glad we're going to Dad's old school. What's the matter, Mom? Nothing. Go on, go to bed. - You have to be up bright and early. - Okay, Mom, bright and early. Good night. - Good night, Mom. - Good night. Say, Mom, did you say there are winter sports? - Oh, yes, it's in Massachusetts. - Boy, I can hardly wait to get there. How much you wanna bet I make the hockey team? Now, don't forget, boys, Dad got good grades too. He wasn't just interested in athletics. - I haven't forgotten. - Don't worry. He won't be ashamed of us. - Here's your car, gentlemen. - We'd better get on. Oh, no, don't go yet, there's still time. Remember your promise? - About writing? Sure. - How about you? Oh, of course, Mom, I'll write, but, gee, a fella has a lot to do. All aboard! Bye, Mom. Come on, Keith. All right. Give me a chance, will you? Goodbye, Mom. Goodbye. Board! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait, wait! Wait a minute, wait a minute. For the two little boys. Okay, lady. Well, there they go. The birds have left the nest. Oh, Mother, please don't start sentimentalizing. Can't a person say anything to you these days? Will you have tea with me? I want to talk to you. - I'm meeting Ginna at the Blackmore. - This is most unpleasant. Having to catch my daughter on the run on a station platform... ...of all places, when I have something important to say. - What is it? - Now, you needn't sigh. It's a thought for your future. Frank had dinner with me last night. He's such a sweet fellow, such a genuine, splendid character. What are you getting at, Mother? Before I go south, since you refuse to go with me... ...I want to know that my child's future's assured. And I think that next to Paul, Frank is by far the best man for you. Oh, really, how can you bring up such a subject at this time? I have a feeling that Frank would like nothing better. What I think apparently makes no difference. May I remind you that at your age, you can't afford to be particular. I don't wanna discuss it now. I mean it. We'll continue in the taxi. I'll drop you at the Blackmore. I'd rather walk. It's a lovely fall day. Honestly, there are times I could shake you. - Of all the stubborn... - All right, Mother, I'll ride with you. Jess. Jess. Ginna. I just wanna get my bearings a second. You look tired, Jess. - I needed that. Two more, please. - Yes, ma'am. Well, did the boys get off all in one piece? Yes, they've gone. Ginna, isn't it awful the way things happen between parents and children? You bring them to the world, they're yours. They depend on you for everything. But so soon, it changes. They start to pull away and you have to sit tight and let them. If you don't, it ends up like Mother and me. You were certainly a model child. I've been rotten to her lately. I could kill myself for snapping at her. I know how Ionely she is, but... She's got to accept it, just as you've had to accept the boys leaving. I'm accepting it. But I'm not liking it. I can tell you that. Phyllis. I haven't seen her since she got back from Reno. I'm afraid Phyllis is taking her freedom a little too seriously. Baby told me about her. Oh, Ginna, women on the loose can be such a mess. I know. How do I know I won't be like that in a year or so? Ever since I was 17, Paul's been my entire life. Before that, it was Mother. Recently, it's been the boys. Now what do I do when I have to start out from scratch? I'm scared, Ginna. Scared to death. Well, look who's here. - Hello, George. - Oh, hello. I saw you two jabbering away. You need a man to liven up the party. We were discussing serious problems. I'll see that you get over that. - Going back to Lake, Jess? - Yes. I had to drive in town today. I'll give you a free ride out. You know what Riette says about your driving. I promise you on my word of honor I won't go over 30 miles an hour. If you can't take the word of honor of an old friend, what's the world come to? Why don't you, Jess? Anything's better than the train, even George. - You see, you're safe, no bones broken. - Thank you, George. Oh, you don't wanna go in yet. Have a cigarette. - Going to be in later on? - Yes, I suppose so. Riette's laid up with one of her headaches. I'll have to be home at dinner, but I can say I have to go somewhere... ...on business later on. - Well, George... - I've always been crazy about you. Don't be silly, George, you must be tight. Come on, grow up, you're a big girl now. Let me go, I mean it. I promise you, nobody needs to know anything. They wouldn't suspect you anyway. Let me go, George. No hard feelings, Jess. Lincoln, 24571. Lake Forest, 31966. Hello, Ginna? Ginna, can I come in and see you? Now. I've got to. I can't stand it here alone. Thanks, Ginna. Come in, Jess. I hope you didn't mind my phoning. Of course not. Cary was asleep, I was reading. I have the kettle boiling for some tea. You want some? I don't know what's the matter with me. I seem to be going to pieces. Oh, what am I gonna do, Ginna? What am I going to do? I've tried, you know I have. I've done everything. I worked every day at the hospital. But when the day is over and I go up to that empty room... ...the house is closing down on me. Everything's closing down on me. Mother and having the boys gone. Oh, what's the matter with me, Gin? I can't seem to stop this crying. Drink this, Jess. I'm sorry, Gin, it's awful to come here like this. I'm so sorry. Stop saying that. If you don't get out of that house and away from your mother... ...you will end up in the sanitarium. Oh, Gin, I've never been that ill in my life. It isn't only the body that breaks down, Jess. The mind can go too, you know. It just makes me sick the way you've let everyone manage you all your life. You've got to start being yourself for a change. Circumstances have altered your whole life. You're no longer Mrs. Paul Drummond, you're Jessica Drummond. But your life's not finished. It's happened to thousands and thousands of women... ...all through the ages. And now it's happened to you. Listen, Jess, Cary and I are going to Los Angeles on business... ...and you're going with us. After the business part is over... ...we have the loan of a cabin at Lake Tahoe. There'll be snow by then. It'll do us all good. If I go anywhere, I should go south with Mother. All right, go south with your mother. I, for one, am not gonna make any decisions for you. Nobody's asking you to make decisions for me. I'm the one who has to face Mother with it, you don't. Well, I'm glad to see you can stick up for yourself. I've been a beast to you, Ducky, but I'm crazy about you. Please go with us. We could have such fun. - All right, I'll go. - Good. Now let's put you to bed before you change your mind. Hey. Hey, you. Hey, come here. Hey! Hey! - Well? - I... Anyone who can do that to a ski hasn't any business... ...wandering alone in the woods. I know, sorry to bother you. It's stupid of me. But I've been going around in circles for a long time, I just don't know... Just one thing at a time, please. I'm staying in the Grant cabin and I know it's somewhere around here... ...but I can't seem to get my bearings. - Not so fast, please. Now, to begin with, you say you're staying at the Grant cabin. - Yes. - All right. Now, take a look down through those trees. No, further over to the right. Way over. Now, I can see that you're a tenderfoot all right, I can see the cabin. Oh, I do see it now. Well, good. Lesson number one. Now, lesson number two is how to get there. Oh, I can get there now... Sorry. Now that I have my directions. I'm sorry to have spoiled that wonderful hill for you. Now, just a moment. It's a good mile. In half an hour, it'll be too dark to see. You'll end up wandering in circles again. I'm perfectly able to go straight down through those trees. Really? Well, you appointed me your guardian. And I intend to stay so until I see you safely inside that cabin. Now, the first thing is to get rid of those skis. Hurry up. Yes. Now, you can ride on the back of mine. I can't, I'm learning. I'll upset your balance. Don't be frightened, I'm not exactly an amateur. Come on, hurry up. Get on. Now, hold on. No, no, I said hold on. This way. That's right. Now, just relax and let me do the thinking for a few minutes. Lesson number three. When it's a question of breaking a leg or losing a hat, just forget the hat. Now look at that. Now I know it's going to be dark before we get to that cabin. Cary. Cary, I think I see someone. Ginna! Hiya, Ginna! Jess, oh, Jess! Oh, Cary, thank heaven she's here. - No need for you to get pneumonia. - I'll be all right. I knew she'd turn up. Oh, honestly, Cary, sometimes I could brain you. - Darling, I've been frantic. - We had a slight accident. I was gonna send Cary to find you no matter what happened to him. Oh, by the way, this is... Oh, I'm sorry. - I don't even know your name. - Major Landis, Scott Landis. - Cary Abbott. This is my Frau. - Glad to know you. - Hello. - How do you do? Come on, sit down, let's all have a hot rum. You look frozen. Thanks, I will. - Stationed around here somewhere? - No, I had a 10 days' leave. I headed for the mountains to catch up with my skiing. - You'd spent the last 10 years... - I didn't say the last 10. They got me sitting behind a desk. I'm not used to it. My tongue's hanging out. My winter sports are intimately tied up with hot rum. Excuse me. Now, just for the record, what's your name? Jessica Dru... Drummond, but they usually call me Jess. I like Jessica better. Jess reminds me of a particularly stubborn mule... ...I once had trouble with in Texas. You seem to have been around. Oh, yes, we mule skinners get around quite a bit. Allow me, it's... Thank you. And now shall we start all over again, Miss Drummond? Mrs. Drummond. - Is your husband here with you? - My husband passed away this spring. I'm sorry. Well, here they are. I hope they're good. Well, thanks. - Major. - Thank you. To Jess' safe return. And to the St. Bernard who found her. Wake up, lazy bones, you're a punk hostess. - I was only resting my eyes. - Never will admit she's been asleep. - Come on, let's go to bed, huh? - All right. Don't get up. - Good night. - Good night. You're not gonna try to get back to your cabin tonight, are you? If you don't mind, I'd like to bunk here on the couch. Swell. Jess, see that he has plenty of blankets. - See you in the morning. Good night. - Good night. - Well... - You're not sleepy, are you? I ought to be, I haven't had so much exercise in weeks. Did you good. I hate to think of leaving here in four days. No, I shouldn't say that. Why not? I have responsibilities. I have two boys, 12 and 14. Well, I suppose that's my cue to say... ...you look too young to have boys 12 and 14. You have an odd way of catching people on everything. You expect stock phrases? - No. No, I don't at all. - Oh, confess it. You've been hermetically sealed most of your life, haven't you? Well, I suppose I have in a way. Do you like it? No, not entirely, but... - When you're used to a thing... - It's time to change. You are very self-sufficient, aren't you? Well, I never even gave it a thought. You see, I've never had much chance to express me. Even when I went to Europe, I went with Mother and... I know. You stayed at all correct hotels and spoke French religiously... ...while you were in Paris. Oh, yes. I've seen hundreds of people like you all over the world. Guide book in hand, walking ruthlessly from cathedral to cathedral. Yes, I'm afraid you're right. You know, I like you very much. Now I suppose you're going to rush off to bed. Yes, I will. Good night, Jessica. Good night, Major Landis. In case you're cold, Major Landis. Well, we're all packed. I hope Jess finishes hers in time. It must be 30 below zero. Wasn't it wonderful that Scott happened along... ...to give Jess such a good time? He's very attractive. I think he really likes her. Jess really is the wife type. She needs someone. Yeah. Do you suppose he's the right man for her? Talk to me. What are you mumbling about? I was thinking about Scott and Jess. Oh, now, listen, my pet, stop thinking about them. For once, keep your fingers out of the pie. You're a hard-boiled mug. And you are a matchmaking nuisance. Good night, my pet. Good night. Oh, they turned out their light. Oh, this nice warm room makes me realize how cold it is outside. - Me for the fire. - And me for that bottle of bourbon. Wasn't it a wonderful day? I've never seen a ghost mining town. That view of Donner Lake through the trees. No, my favorite was Donner monument by the moonlight. Why do people live in the city? I could stay here forever. - Oh, yeah, I forgot all about them. - Here. Just enough for a nightcap. Cheerio. You know, you've made a new woman out of me. I feel like a kid. You look like one. Why did you do that? We were getting along so well together. Because I thought it was a very fitting ending to a swell four days. I meant what I said. I don't think you did. How many times do you have to be told? Just exactly what is your game? Does everyone have to have a game? Well, I don't know what it's all about. You admit that we get along well... ...and we've spent most of our days together. You're grown up, or aren't you? I'm afraid we don't understand each other. I guess we haven't from the beginning. You better go. All right. Goodbye, Jessica. Be sure and lock your door. Oh, Mrs. Drummond, I surely thought you'd eat something tonight. Anna, bring in a plate and eat with me. Why, Mrs. Drummond, what's the matter? Please, I want you to. All right, if you want me to. I'll answer it, Anna. Why, Frank, how nice to see you. I was out this way, I took a chance. Thank you, you're just in time for dinner. - You needn't bother with me. - Oh, nonsense, take off your coat. I'll put these in water after we eat. They're lovely. - You're lovely too. - Anna, Anna, look who's here. Sit down. Good evening, Mr. Everett. I certainly am glad you came. Thank you, Anna. It certainly is nice having you make a fuss over me like this. Well, I'm terribly glad to see you. You have a way of making people feel at home. You really look better, Jess. I'm glad now you went away on your trip. Didn't you want me to go? I suppose I wanted you to stay here so I could look after you myself. That's sweet of you, Frank. You've no idea how nice this is, sitting here with you. It's nice to have you here. It's no secret how I feel about you. You and I know the same people, we like the same things. I think the boys like me. Excuse me. I'll go. Hello? Hello, Ginna. Cary and I are at the Georgian Room. Guess who's here? Scott Landis. He's with some other people. Not really? Frank's here. I'd love to. Maybe. Bye. That was Ginna. She and Cary are in the Georgian Room. How are they? Haven't seen them for some time. They're fine. They suggested we join them. Well, would you like to? - Lf you'd like to. It might be fun. - All right. You finish your dinner. I'll hurry and change my dress. Well, you look fine. Oh, this old thing? Oh, no, I wanna look glamorous. Listen, Jess, if you'd rather not dance... I'm sorry, I guess I'm just a little out of practice. Let's sit down. - Any success? - No, not yet. - Don't give up hope. - What are you two up to? Private monkey business, no doubt. She has something on the fire, but it isn't definite. Oh, don't pay any attention to her. Well, what would you like to drink with dinner? I said, what would you like to drink? Anything you want to order. - Hello. - Oh, hello. - Hello, major. - Hello. This is like old home week. Nice to be back. Major Landis, I'd like you to meet Frank Everett. - How do you do? - Won't you join us? No, thanks. Won't you sit down? I'm entertaining an old girlfriend and her new husband. Sounds a little complicated. On the contrary, I get along well with the husbands of my old girlfriends. And by the way, if we hadn't parted so hurriedly at Tahoe... ...I could have explained to you I was gonna be stationed here. I'll give you a ring. What about giving me your telephone number? It's in the book. Well, thanks, nice to have seen you again. - Goodbye. - Bye. Well, here's... Hello? No, really, I subscribe to so many magazines already. No, thank you, I'd have no use for another cookbook. Goodbye. That was somebody trying to sell something. Why don't you let me go on with this and you go to the Hawks' for bridge? Oh, Anna, it's no fun going around with the old crowd anymore. They're all very much married and I feel dreadfully out of it. Well, you ought to go out more. All work and no play makes Jack a dull... You go this time. It's never anything important. Hello? Yes. Yes. This time it's a Major Landis. Yes, he's the man I met at Lake Tahoe. Hello? Well, I never thought you'd take the trouble to look for it. How are you, Scott? I'm working for the Red Cross. What are you doing? Well, don't work too hard. Yes, I... I can meet you tomorrow night. At the Lakeside? Six. I'll be there. Goodbye, Scott. Well, what did he want? I'm having dinner with him tomorrow night. - Are you going someplace fancy? - I'm meeting him at his apartment. Oh, and of course, we'll go directly out somewhere. Now what are you grinning about? I'm just thinking what Mrs. Kimball would say. Is Major Landis in? Mrs. Drummond calling. - What's the name? - Mrs. Drum... Mrs. Drummond. Oh, yes, he's expecting you. Room 503. Thank you. Five, please. Jessica, what a surprise. How are you, my dear? Good evening, Mrs. Thompson. I haven't seen you for months. My, but you look well. What have you been doing with yourself? - Oh, I went away for a while. - Has mother returned yet? Oh, yes. I mean, no, she's still south. But I expect her back any day. - Hello, Jessica. - Hello. I just stopped to say hello to Mrs. Thompson. Well, it's lovely to see you again. Goodbye. Going down? What a nice place you've... It isn't mine. It belongs to a friend who's loaning it to me while I'm stationed here. - Who was that dragon? - A friend of Mother's. Now I can understand that startled-fawn look. Quite a coincidence my seeing you the other night. - Did you have a nice time? - Very. I rather liked that Frank Everett. He seems like a nice guy. - He's not only a nice guy, but... - But a gent. I can't imagine you having anything in common with him. I don't mean that the way you took it. I mean... You know, you're what my old mother would have called a caution. How is that? You know, if you hadn't been poured into that icy mold of conventionality... ...you'd be a good egg. You're gonna hatch one of these days. Anybody ever tell you you had a nice grin? Let's sit on the couch. It's by far the coziest place. Sit down. It's not a booby trap. I thought perhaps it was. There. Tell me, what did you do today? The usual thing. - How could it possibly interest you? - Oh, but it does, very much. Well, I went to the Red Cross and rolled bandages. And then I did my shopping and then I had lunch with some friends. Lunch? What did you have for lunch? Consomm? and chef's salad, that's all. That's all? - Well, black coffee. - No dessert? No, I never eat dessert. I notice you haven't finished your martini either. Well, I would if you'd let me go. Oh, well, that's very easy to remedy. One, two, three, and drink. Landis, make a note of this. You mustn't waste your good prewar gin on Mrs. Drummond. Now, let's see. What were we talking about? Oh, yes. You were having lunch with some friends. I guess I've said all there is to say about that. Why don't you sit back and relax? You're not a very relaxing person. - Are these a family heirloom? - No. I mean, yes. They belong to my mother. They do? Your mother. Well, well. She's south. She goes every year. I usually go with her, but... I'm looking forward to meet your mother. Why, I'm not sure you'd like Mother. She's... - Old school. - Well, I couldn't have imagined that. It's a cute hat. I like the way you do your hair too. Warm in here, isn't it? Is it? Well, with all this talk of chef's salad and consomm?... ...I'm beginning to get a bit hungry. - Would you like your dinner now? - Oh, yes, I'd love it. All right. Any special place you'd like to eat? - No. Any place. Any place at all. - Any place but here. I'm amazed at you. Have you gone completely out of your mind? Please don't use that tone with me, Mother. - I'm no longer a child. - You force me to treat you like one. You refused rudely to go on a trip with me. Then you rashly drew on your bank account... ...to go on some sort of a junket with Ginna Abbott. And with what a result. The whole town is talking. A few gossipy old women led by Mrs. Thompson... ...who ought to know better. - She did it for your own good. The idea of going to a strange man's apartment. Not even someone we know. And from what I gather, a man with a somewhat unsavory reputation. Major Landis is a gentleman. Frank met and liked him, so did Ginna and Cary. Ginna and Cary would. Birds of a feather. This is too ridiculous. I'm 33 years old and I've done nothing to be ashamed of. - Naturally. You're a Kimball. - What are you so upset about? It's the principle of the thing. You're a woman alone. You have to be twice as circumspect. The world allows considerable liberty to wives it has never allowed to widows. I notice, for instance, you're no longer wearing black. - Nor do I intend to wear it again. - That's entirely your affair. If you won't think of yourself, at least remember your duty to Paul. Keep his name out of this. I've had enough. I'm sick to think I've taken it as long as I have. - Jessica. - You talk about duty. It's your duty to tell them to shut up instead of listening to gossip. You talk about wanting to help me... ...but what you want is to drag me into your ivory tower. I won't allow you to, ever. Jessica, come back here. Where are you going? To give those old biddies something to gossip about. - Is Major Landis in? - Just a moment. - He's in, but he's very busy. - I'll go up anyway. But, madam, he doesn't wish to be disturbed. - Five, please. - Yes, ma'am. - Hello, Scott. - Well, hello. I'm out of breath. - I hope I didn't disturb you. - No, not at all. I happened to be going by the hotel so I thought I'd stop in. - What's this? - Martini, of course. - Expecting somebody? - No, took a little time out to have one. - Do you mind? - Help yourself. You know, it's amazing how one can learn to like martinis. It's an acquired taste, like anchovies. Well, here we are, aren't we? Yeah. What's next on the program? I don't know. I suppose it's your move. All right. As long as I'm supposed to be a partner in the crime... ...supposing you tell me what it's all about? Or don't you want to tell me? Not particularly. I suppose you know anyway. You know almost everything. The chicken's beginning to hatch, maybe, huh? Well, good. I know I'm acting like a fool. I hope you'll forgive me, Scott. You're going home. Right now. Yes, Scott. As a matter of fact, the reason I stopped by... ...was to ask you to drop in Christmas Eve. Oh, sure, sure. Well, honestly, I mean it. I want you to meet my kids. - I'd like to. - You will come? - Yes, but I'll be a little bit late. - That's all right. We don't start trimming the tree until after dinner. Well, that's fine. I'll be there, reindeer and all. - Goodbye, Scott. - Goodbye. No. Oh, yes. Oh, stop grinning. Going down. Well, I see I'm in the right place. I'm Major Landis. - Glad to know you. Come in. - May we take your hat and coat? - Thanks. - Mom, it's Major Landis. You just missed a swell dinner. Roast goose. Maybe I can get a drumstick later, huh? With Uncle Cary around, fat chance. Hello, Scott. Merry Christmas. I'm sorry I'm late, but they ran in a meeting on me. At last I see the gem in its proper setting. Do you like it? I guess the boys introduced themselves. I'm Kim and he's Keith. Hello again. Oh, I almost forgot. I've got something for you. Why, Scott. Presents? You're slipping. Isn't that what people do at Christmas? Give presents? And it's straight from the five-and-dime. - Merry Christmas, major. - Merry Christmas to you. Glad to see you again. You missed the first round. - Thank you. - This is Anna. - How do you do? - Very happy to meet you, I'm sure. I always say there's no fool like an old fool. Well, I must get back to my kitchen. Oh, Anna, let me help you. All those pots and pans. Nobody's gonna be messing around in my kitchen. - Not while I'm in it. - Anna's a little high. She even forgot her presents. Hurry, drink her down so you can catch up. This tastes better than the hot buttered rum at Lake Tahoe. How about another one for your long-suffering wife? You know what happened to Anna. Let's turn off this canned music and get some of the real stuff from Jess. Oh, no. I haven't touched the piano for a year. Go ahead, Mom. Play "Silent Night, Holy Night." That was Dad's favorite. All right, Keith. But I'm not sure I can get through it. Come on, Jess, please. It'll sound good to me. - I hope so. - This is like old times. We're gonna all sing, aren't we? I hope my pet carries a tune better than last year. Well, you asked for it. Here it is. - Hello, Grandma. - Hello, Grandma. Merry Christmas. - Hello, nice boys. Merry Christmas. - Why don't you come inside? No, I've no intention of going in there. I can't stay. - Here are some presents for you. - Thanks a lot. Swell. You can exchange them. I see so little of you I don't know what you like. We'll like them. Why don't you come inside? - We're having fun. - No, I can't stay. - Major Landis is in there. - Major Landis? - Not really. - What do you mean, Grandma? - Never mind what I mean. - Are you coming in after all? Well, since it's Christmas Eve, perhaps I really should go in. Okay. Come on. - Look what Santa Claus brought. - Mother, Merry Christmas. - Hello, Mrs. Kimball. - Merry Christmas. I just drove by to deliver my presents. Don't let me disturb your fun. Merry Christmas, Virginia, and you, Frank. Merry Christmas. - And you, Cary. - Merry Christmas. Mother, this is Major Landis. Scott, my mother, Mrs. Kimball. - How do you do? - How do you do? - I've heard about you. - Isn't it time for the presents? - I'll say it is. - Remember, kids, just one apiece. Now, Jessica, I want to talk to Major Landis. Yes, Mother. I understand you met my girl in California. - Just where are you stationed? - Chicago. Temporarily, of course. Isn't that rather a coincidence? First in California and now in Chicago. Entirely a coincidence, I assure you. In fact, I might be out of the country next week. Who knows? - Are you a friend of the Abbotts? - Oh, no, no. Your daughter introduced me to them. And where, may I ask, did you meet her, then? I can't divulge that information. - Why? What do you mean? - Secret business. - Are you joking with me? - Oh, no, no. Your daughter can tell you if she wishes. Jessica. Just what did you go to California for? Are you keeping something from me? Let's not start that. Not on Christmas Eve. - Come, I have a gift for you. - It's my fault. - Can't we all start all over again? - No, we cannot. I can see that you're a thorough-going scalawag, young man. - I'm delighted to hear you say so, madam. - Mother... - And kindly stop calling me madam. - Mother, please. Now, Jessica, I know what I'm doing, if you don't. - Young man... - Please, not young man. I think you're in league with the devil. Good night. Good night. - Mother... - Don't leave your guests, Jessica. There went the spirit of Christmas. Well, shall we try and go on with the party? Yes. Good night, Jess. Goodbye and thanks for the lovely present. - I wish you'd let me call a cab. - Nothing doing. After that dinner, a walk to the station will do us good. In these shoes? You may not know it, my darling... ...but after the first block, you're carrying me. - We'll see you later. So long. - Goodbye. - Hi, Mom. - Good night, Mom. Good night. - Good night, boys. Sleep well. - On Christmas Eve? Don't dare you wake me up until 7. The rest of the presents can wait that long. - Okay, Mom. - It's nice to be home again, Mom. It's nice to have you home. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Mom. Good night. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Major Landis. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, boys. Well, Scott, now you've seen me as I really am. Home, children, Mother. Of course, Mother was more than I bargained for. On the contrary. I thought she was a wonderful museum piece. - Did you like my kids? - Of course I like them. They're yours, aren't they? It was nice to have you here tonight. You didn't invite me here on purpose by any chance, did you? Well, now that you mention it, perhaps I did. Jessica, I've got to talk to you. Sit down, please. Jessica, we simply cannot go on like this. You want to stop seeing me? Of course I don't want to stop seeing you. But I know myself and I'm beginning to understand you. It'll only make you unhappy. It's inevitable. Go ahead, Scott. Well, seeing you here tonight in this house... ...that you once shared with your husband... Don't talk about that now, please. Don't you see, I've got to talk about it? You expect a love affair to lead to marriage and... Scott, are you trying to tell me you're not the marrying kind? Well, I've never felt that it was right for me. Dutch courage. Jessica... Frank Everett's the type of man for you. - I don't love Frank. - But there are others. As long as I'm hanging around, you won't find them. Suppose you let me think for myself. But don't you see? There's no future in this for you. I'll cross my bridges when I come to them. Well, women are funny. - I guess I'd better be going. - Don't take it so big, Scott. I know what I'm doing. I wonder. You're not the only one who can give Christmas presents. Thank you, Jessica. Shall I open it now? I thought it would be nicer if I gave it to you when we were alone. Well. It's kind of silly. Apparently, we had the same idea. Wait till you see yours. - When am I going to see you? - I'll call you tomorrow. Good night, Jessica. Good night. Hello. Hello, Jessica. Yes, I know. I got in about a half an hour ago. Sure, our date is still on. A Landis would never renege on a thing like that. Do I sound funny? What a woman. You worry about the darnedest things. You get dressed and make yourself beautiful. Yeah, I'll be there as quickly as possible. By the way, how are the boys? They've gone to a party? All right, kids, go out in the hall and have some sandwiches... ...and cider if you want it. I'm as hungry as a bear. Isn't this a fun party? I love to come to Gretchen's. This is my first New Year's Eve party with all the trimmings. - This apple cider's good. - Try one of these. They're super. Let's sit over here. I wanna talk to you. All right, Keith. Say, Penny, are you my girl? Well, I kind of thought so. You see, I have to go back to school in a few days... ...and I wanna get things sort of settled. I mean, whether you're gonna write to me regularly. You know, a guy likes to know where he stands. You know I'll write. Kim. Kim Drummond, you come back here, Kim. I don't see why you can't tell me what happened. I had to ask Droopy to the party. After all, his mother and father are here. - Let's go home. - What's the idea? Keith, make him stay. He's mad because we asked Droopy to sit down with us. That's not it at all. It's because what people say about your mother. They've been saying that all during the holidays. Wait a minute. Kim, what were they saying? L... I'll tell you on the way home. Your mother always came here for New Year's. All of a sudden, she doesn't. No wonder people are talking. If that's the way you feel about it, I'm glad we're going home. Don't come back here ever. I never wanna speak to you again as long as I live. Come in. Boys, you're home so early. Keith, dear, come and hook me up. I'm in a dreadful hurry. Are you going to the Van Ormans' after all? No, I'm going to Chicago. Well, everybody expected you at the Van Ormans'. Who's everybody? Well, everybody at the party. Your friends. Oh, no. I told Mrs. Van Orman a week ago I wasn't able to come. But I'm terribly flattered. I didn't know I was so popular. Mom, did you go to the fights with Major Landis? Yes. Boys, if you have anything on your mind, I wish you'd tell me. You never went to the fights with Dad. Dad never asked me. Well, you came home on the train from Chicago at 4:00 in the morning. They made a lot of jokes about that at the party. And all that stuff about Lake Tahoe. And you running after Major Landis. Have they been telling you these things? Not us, but everybody else. I didn't believe it. Mom, none of it's true, is it? Not their interpretation of it. We kind of hoped you'd say that they were all liars. Listen to me, boys. There are two sides to everything, even gossip. I've done nothing whatever you need be ashamed of. I don't wanna discuss it anymore. One of you answer the door. Anna's out. I'll get it. Mom, you ought to see it from our side. I don't wanna discuss it, Keith. - Good evening. - Good evening. - May I come in a minute? - Sure. - Is your mother ready? - I'll tell her you're here. Coming, Scott. - Hello, Scott. - Hello, Jessica. - Anything wrong? - No, nothing. I'm sorry about this, boys. There's nothing more I can say now. - Good night. - Good night, boys. Scott, do you mind stopping by the Van Ormans' with me... ...for a few minutes? - Lf it won't take too long. They won't hold that reservation after 11:30 in Chicago. It won't take long. 201 Lakeshore Drive. Yes, ma'am. - Happy New Year, Johnson. - The same to you, Mrs. Drummond. - May I take your coat? - No, thanks. We can't stay. Good evening, children, Happy New Year. Mrs. Drummond, I'm so glad you came. Thank you. - Hello, everybody. - Hello, Jessica. Darling, so you did decide to come to the party after all. How sweet of you. I want you to meet Major Landis of whom you've heard so much. - Hi, major. - Mrs. Van Orman, our hostess. How do you do? So nice to see you at last, Major Landis. Mr. And Mrs. Hawks, Mr. And Mrs. Hanson. Mr. And Mrs. Moore. All very old friends of mine. I'm surprised you could remember all our names. Hello, Jess. Come on over and have a drink. We're way ahead of you, but come and have a drink. Scott, this is Mr. Van Orman. - How do you do? - How are you? What will you have to drink? You soldiers can hold your liquor. I started with bourbon. Might as well stay with it. - What will you have, Jess? - Nothing. We can't stay long. The boys told me you missed me so here I am. Well, of course we miss you. New Year's just doesn't seem to be New Year's without the Drummonds. George, will you see that Major Landis is kept amused... ...while I speak to Riette? - Well, can't it be said here? No, I'm afraid not. Come on. - Didn't I see you at the fights, major? - Oh, yes, last Thursday. - Good fights, weren't they? - Swell. Happy New Year. I'll get this off my chest in a hurry. The boys came home from the party upset by some things they overheard. - Why pick on me? - Because it happened in your house. I don't wanna know who did the talking... ...but I'm asking you to put a stop to it. I did the talking. Since we're letting our hair down, I think you're behaving abominably. Is being seen with a man such a dreadful crime? It's the way you're seen which we don't like. What is this nonsense about Lake Tahoe? You don't expect us to believe... ...you went there for a pleasant little rest cure. No wonder the boys distrust me if that's the kind of thing you're saying. How can you do it, Riette? What right have you? The right of a friend who hates to see you make a fool. A friend should come to me and not allow gossip that even children hear. I'm terribly disillusioned. I don't mind saying so. Well, how do you suppose we feel? We thought you missed Paul dreadfully. But it's obvious that you forget pretty quickly. Oh, I see. It isn't on account of Paul you're saying the things you do. You resent me for being able to make a new life for myself. Then you admit you're guilty? That's all you got out of what I've been saying? Really, Jessica, I'm giving a party. I haven't got time to go into a discussion of ethics. Don't look like that. Let's join the others. And I won't embarrass you in front of your handsome friend. I'm afraid I don't care enough anymore. Then why did you bother to come here at all? Because I was still coward enough to want to save my reputation. How quaint. You know, I've been a coward all my life. And I'm not going to be one anymore. No matter how hard it is to strike out on my own... ...I'm gonna do what I think is right for me. Even if it means breaking with everything in the past. That includes you and these so-called friends of mine. Jessica, I'm afraid we're going to be late. Yes, Scott. Good night, Riette, and a very happy New Year. - Good night. - Come on, Scott. Let's go to Chicago before we lose the table. - We don't have to. - No, I wanna celebrate. It's wonderful to get something off your chest. Come on, we'll see the New Year in with bells on. All right. - Chicago. - Yes, sir. Happy New Year! They say that the person you're with as the New Year comes in... ...is the person you'll be with all during the coming year. I know it's going to be true. This place has a particular sentimental value for me. - Do you know why? - I think I can guess. Suppose I hadn't been here that night? - I don't like to think about it. - Jessica, l... Don't ask me if it was coincidence that brought us together again... ...because, well, I might tell you the truth. Well, I think we should be getting home. It's rather late. I have one bottle of good champagne in the ice chest. Shall we have it when you take me home? Yes. I'd like to have a last glass with you. That is, the last glass on New Year's. Kim, are you asleep? - No. - I'm not either. Did you hear a noise downstairs? I guess Mom's home. What time is it, anyhow? Three-thirty. Maybe she didn't have such a good time. - You know what I'd like to do? - What? When we hear her coming down the hall, let's yell "Happy New Year." - She'd like that. - Okay. - Hurry up, Jessica. - Coming. - Here's luck to us, Scott. - Luck. This is by far the best. I wish now we'd stayed here by ourselves. Do you realize we didn't even know each other three months ago? Jessica, there's some... I suppose it's foolish of me to make plans for the future... ...but I don't know, I can't get out of the habit. - Plans? - Of all the things we can do. It's so lovely here in the spring. We can swim in the pool and have picnic suppers. Maybe you don't care for picnics. Not particularly. No. I guess you're not the picnic type. I'll see if I can borrow Mother's cottage at Lake Geneva. And you and Cary and Ginna and I can go there for a weekend. I don't know whether or not the canoe is working... Listen, Jessica. I've got to give it to you straight. This is our last evening together. I've got my orders to go to New York. Seven o'clock this morning. That's why I brought you home so early. I suppose I should've told you when I got the news... ...but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. You were having such a good time. I knew it would be sudden, but I didn't expect it to be this soon. - Is this it? - Yes. I'll be shipped out. - Can you tell me how soon? - I don't know. All I know is that it will be sudden. I think I always knew it would be like this. I'm going to New York too. I don't care how little time there is. All that matters is that I can be with you. Oh, darling, I knew I'd lose you someday. You warned me and I accepted it. But now that the time has come, I can't let you go, I can't. You don't think I want to, do you? I don't know anything except I love you. I was afraid to admit it. I thought when you did go away I could pick up my old life again... ...and forget you, but... - You still need to do that. - Now I don't wanna forget you. Don't talk like that. Don't you understand? I'm happy loving you. You would've been better off never to have known me. Don't say that. Don't think it. All I wanna hear is you want me in New York... ...as much as I wanna be there. You know that I want you more than anything in the world. Then nothing else matters. Maybe I can get a reservation. I'll keep on trying until I do. - Don't worry, please. - Jessica. You must hurry and pack and so must I. I'll meet you at the station at 7:00 on the dot. Right. Mom, are you going away? - We heard what you said on the stairs. - Yes. I'm going to New York. I have to hurry and pack and be at the station before 7. - Why? - Major Landis is going away. I want to see as much of him as possible before he does. You'll be leaving in a couple of days. Anna will see you off. I'm awfully sorry to have to go while you're still on your vacation, but... ...try to understand. I have to hurry. Kim? Keith? Hello? Yes? Yes. They are? I'll be there as soon as I can. Come in, Jessica. - Where are they? - They're in the drawing room. - How long have they been here? - Only about 10 minutes. Just a moment, please. I haven't asked the boys what has happened. They have never been close to me. For that reason, I know there must be something very wrong at home... ...for them to have come to me for help. All I beg is that you think carefully before you go into that room. Otherwise, I'm afraid that you'll regret this bitterly all the rest of your life. Now, go to your boys, my dear. Boys, I don't know what to say or how to begin. What good did it do to run away? We don't wanna live at home anymore. - Keith, what an awful thing to say. - You lied to us. - We don't know what to believe. - I told you the truth, always. They all said things about you and Major Landis. And now you're going to New York with him. It proves they were true. We'll never believe anything you say again. Mom, don't you remember Dad at all? Don't say that, please. You know I remember Dad. You've forgotten him. Nobody remembers Dad but us. That isn't true. Can't you understand that I might learn to care for someone else... ...and still have a place in my heart for Dad? But you belong to Dad. It doesn't make any difference whether he's dead or not. Boys... Will you try for a few minutes... ...to think of me as someone other than your mother? How can we? You are. All right. Then just sit down and listen. I don't know whether or not I can make you understand. You know how terribly ill Dad was for almost two years. He didn't want you to see him suffer. I knew how he felt so I kept things from you. Dad always liked life. It wasn't life for him to have to stay in bed. Especially with so much pain. After he died... ...I tried in every way I could to forget the two years of his illness. You see... ...I wanted to be able to remember the good times with Dad... ...when we were all together. But I was so terribly Ionely... ...all I could think of was Dad toward the last. Remember the night before you went away to school? You went out with Gretchen and Penny. I had to bite my lips to keep from asking you to stay with me. And with you gone away, I... I got so I dreaded coming home. If I hadn't gone away with Ginna and Cary and met Major Landis... ...I don't know what would have happened to me. Does he mean as much to you as Dad used to? Don't say "used to," dear. Dad still means just as much to me, only in a different way. I can't explain it. Someday, when you're older... ...you'll understand that one can give all one's heart... ...to more than one person... ...and still remain sincere and loyal. The first time you fall in love, it's all so exciting and wonderful. It can only be like that once. But second love can be just as true and just as deep. Boys, I lost Dad. And now I'm losing Major Landis. He's going to be sent away. I'll probably never see him again. It's... It's very hard to lose someone you love. Don't cry, please. Oh, Mom. I want you to be happy. I try to understand, but, golly, it's so hard. It's so hard. Mom... ...can't we go home now? Oh, Keith. I'll say good night to Grandmother for you. - We're going home, Mother. - I'm glad. - I knew you'd do the right thing. - Thank you for helping me. Oh, my dear child, I did nothing. It had to come from you. And I know how much it's taken out of you. It's hard to do what is right sometimes. - I know. - Funny. I never thought you could do anything else. I haven't always been old, Jessica. Young people resent conventions. But as you grow older, you realize that conventions were established... ...because there was need for them. Now, go home and get some rest, my dear. - Good night. - Good night. Scott. Scott. Oh, darling, I can't go to New York with you. I can't leave my boys. They ran away. They don't understand about us. - Ran away? - I got them back. I tried to explain, but they're too young to understand. If I go now, things will never be the same between them and me. Scott, please try to realize why I'm letting you down. - Please forgive me. - There's nothing to forgive, darling. You have to face responsibility. You wouldn't be you if you didn't. I'll always love you. Nothing will ever change that. - Board! - Oh, Scott, this is it. - We have to say goodbye. - No, Jessica, not goodbye. I haven't enough time to say what I'd like... ...but you know how I felt about being tied to anything. Well, I've changed. And, darling, when I come back, and this time I know I'm coming back... ...will you be waiting for me? Oh, Scott. Board! - Yes or no? - I'll wait, no matter how long. - I'll wait. - Bye, darling. - And you won't be too Ionely? - I'll never be Ionely again. (ENGLISH)
