Sometimes, just sometimes, magic can happen. You just have to believe. Why are you so sad? So, you're sad because of everything? I mean, look around. It's a beautiful day outside. Well, you don't scare me. I mean, look at you. You're a clown. You're supposed to make people happy. You know that if you look sad you can't make other people feel happy. Hold on. We're gonna fix you right up. All right? Yeah. It's okay. All right, look up. All right. There. There, now you're happy again. You see, now you're happy. Why don't you talk? You don't talk because that's not what clowns do? Okay. So, what kind of tricks can do? Okay, what now? Wait, how'd you do that? Wait, so it's real magic? See, I told you, if you put your mind to it, you could be happy, right? Believe. Hey mom, you won't believe what I just saw today. But mom. Okay, bye. I have to go home now. Maybe we could meet tomorrow, right? Where will we meet? Oh okay. All right then, I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. It was real magic, I swear. It was a magical clown and he made this butterfly appear right on my hand. How old is this clown? What's his name? He's old and he doesn't have a name. He doesn't talk. That's not what clown do and he has this dog who's really cute. Remember what we talked about? If I let you go out and play, you can't talk to strangers. But he's not a stranger. He's a clown and he knows real magic. He taught me. Do you want me to show you? - Sure. - Okay. All right, come over here. Okay. The clown says, if I put my mind and heart to something, magic can happen. Okay, now give me your hand. Okay. You have to believe and concentrate real hard for the magic to work. Okay, all right. Now, close your hand tight. Now close your eyes. Stop. Okay, open your eyes. All right, now open your hand. Okay, now fold this. Here's where the magic happens. What the heck? I swear there was a butterfly right there. Honey, he probably had some kind of a trick. No, it was real magic. There was a butterfly on my hand and it flew off. Well, it probably takes a lot of practice. Yeah. I probably just have to practice more. Put my mind and heart to it for it to work. You know he's right. If you put your mind to something, you could do anything you want. - Really? - Mh. I can't stop thinking about that clown. He can do real magic. He sounds amazing. I wish I could do magic like him. You are magical. I can't believe you are about to be 10 years old. Your father would be so proud of you. Yeah, but he's probably watching over us right now, right? I think so. Hey, I was thinking we could take a camping trip for your birthday. How does that sound? We could even invite your aunt and your uncle. Does that sound good? Yeah, that sounds nice. Have you thought about what you want for your birthday present? Anything? Even a million bucks. Huh, anything within reason. Can we take the clown with us? Take the clown? Yeah, on our camping trip. He's really fun. - No. - Please, it's my birthday. - Adrien, you just met him. - Please, please. Okay, I'll sleep on it, okay? Okay. Stop. Is that a clown? No, no, no, no. Is that supposed to be us? Is that suppose to be... Okay, all right. Don't touch me, man. What if we don't? What if we don't? Freak. What are you doing? He's bleeding. Dude, he's bleeding. I think he's having a heart attack, man. Gotta go, come on. Let's get outta here. Clown, clown. No. Clown, are you all right? Wake up, wake up. Wake up, wake up, wake up. Wake up clown. Clown. Are you alright? That's bad. Come on, we have to get you to a doctor. There, hold still. I think you need a shower. Hold on, I got an idea. Here, I want you to take a shower. These are my dad's. I'm gonna wash your clothes, okay. Come on. Come on. Come on, shower. You smell. Shower is on the way. Harry Wild. Clown, come on, I made made you lunch. Look at this. I have everything. Look. I have pop tarts, I have waffles, I have muffins, I have donuts, I've got cereal, I've got chocolate syrup, I got ice cream, I got whipped cream. Sit down. And one. Whipped cream. Hey, Harry. Huh? I saw on your jacket, your name was Harry Wild. Can I call you Harry? Ah. Harry. So Harry, last night I did the magic with my mom, but it didn't work. Could you teach me some more about being a clown? I got to go and get your clothes. Wait right here. Adrien, I'm home. Adrien, can you help me, please? Adrien, come on. Adrien? Whose dog is this? Adrien? What did you do? - Who is this? - Oh my gosh. He's the clown I've been telling you about. I was helping him. What did you do? I didn't do anything. He ran right into the window. You hurt him. Come on, help him up. Oh my God, I can't. Get him onto the chair. Get him onto the chair. It's my new friend. Is that my robe? Look at this mom. I am so sorry that I attacked you. I just thought you were some kind of... Oh wow. - Bravo. - Oh my gosh. Thank you. It was so nice meeting you. Thank you. Mom, can he stay with us please? No, no. I think that what Harry is trying to say is that he has to go to his own home. But you don't have a home. Bye. So he can come to the camping trip with us? Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please. Okay, okay, you win. Awesome. This is gonna be the best birthday ever. Hey Clown, Clown, my mom says it's okay for you to come camping with us for my birthday. Do you wanna go? Please, please? My mom says it's okay. It's a clown party and maybe you could teach me some magic. Bravo. Hey mom, is there a reason why they call it Big Bear? 'Cause there's bears. Oh, there are probably bears. Wait, maybe we should get some bear spray. Hey, how are you? So glad you came up here. Yeah. You're still tall. Oh my, who do we have here? Who do we have here Adrien? This is my clown friend and his dog, Foxy. Hi, I'm Michelle. Wow. Thank you. I should do that more, you know. This is my husband Steve. Hey, how are you? Hey, watch it. So I've been working out a little bit. That's great kid. I wish I had the clown to go camping with when it was my birthday. Yeah, and he could do real magic. He can make a butterfly appear out of thin air. Wow. Really? I would pay to see that. How much? 20 bucks. Look at PT Barnum over here. How about I give you five dollars? What? - 15. - 15. Well, got to love the negotiating skills of this kid, huh? Well, you're not gonna get more than 10 bucks out of me just because I already bought you a pretty awesome gift. - Okay. - Deal. Deal. Clown show him your trick. See that? See. Are we supposed to see something? Yeah, there was a butterfly. Didn't you see that? I don't see anything Adrien. You can't see it. You have to be able to see it. Look, it went over there. You know, that was a great trick. Yeah, really great. That was fantastic. Amazing. It's not my problem that you can't see it. Could I have the 10 bucks please? Absolutely. Let me get this. One two, three, four, five and five is 10. What was that? Well that's the $10. You're not gonna tell me that you can't see it. - But we had a deal. - It's a good one. But we had a deal. Did you take your allergy pills honey? Yes, I did until I ran out. You ran out? Yeah, it's okay honey, just relax. He's funny. He's really funny. So why don't we go get the tents and start setting them up? - Yes. - All right. There's a great space out back Adrien. You're gonna love it. I haven't seen Adrien this happy since... Since his father died. Still hurts, huh? I think about Rick everyday. I miss him so much. Yeah, me too. You have to grab the other end right here, that pole. I love you so much. It's okay. You have to get in, okay? One, two, three, go. Oh no. Guys, just relax, all right, I got you. You just want to rip up in the middle. What are you doing? What are you doing guys? Let me get this. Come on, you just got to push. Let me out. - Oh here. - Hey hun, we almost had it. - Alright, I'll be inside. - We'll get it. That is the funniest thing I have ever seen. I don't know who's more of a clown, Steve or the clown. All right here, look. I got Adrien's favorite flavor, chocolates. Oh, it's perfect. Thank you so much for picking this up. You're welcome. - Somebody say chocolate? - Mh. Oh wow, that look's great. - No. - What? Let me just get a little bit. It is not your birthday. Well, you know when it is my birthday, I would like a clown too, okay? Well I already married a clown. Wow. Hey, look at this place. - It's beautiful. - Yeah. This kind of reminds me of where my dad used to take me to teach me how to sling shot. Yeah? Papa? Wow. Do you know how to sling shot? No. You don't know what sling shotting is? You don't? Well do you want me to teach you? All right, so first you have to put a rock, all right? And then you want this to face forward, okay? And then you pull it back, aim, you take a breath and then you let go halfway. Then you let go. Like that. Simple. Hold it tight, okay? You aim and then. - Nice. - Yeah, wow. You know, I'd never seen anything like Adrien's clown before. Does he actually talk? Well, kind of. I mean, he's sort of mumbles in the little clown voice of his. Look, Adrien understands him and you know what's weird is that I'm beginning to understand him too. It's interesting because it's like he's afraid of speaking. Don't psycho analyze their guest Steve. You're not working. Beside, maybe it's just part of his act. Yeah, well maybe, maybe not but I mean he could be suffering from aphemia, which is a type of mutism, which is characterized by the inability to deal with suppressed trauma. I mean, it's like he can't talk. It's like he can't speak out and I think with a little hypnosis, I might be able to get to the bottom of it. Cut it our Steve. No, I mean, I was wondering about him too. He's homeless. He lives on the beach. What? Did you say homeless? He's a homeless clown. Are you kidding me? Kiki, what are you thinking? I know it sounds crazy. Okay, look, I do know his name is Harry the Clown, so I googled it, right? And this is all I could come up with. It really looks like him. An old picture. It's an obituary for Harry, the Clown from 1980. 1980? Maybe we could use this. Yeah to aim at it. Yeah. This is a pretty rusty old can. This really looks like your clown. Doesn't he? Well, all right, I'm getting chills. We're moving into like creepy clown territory. You're saying that your clown is Harry's ghost. I'm not saying anything. I'm just showing you what I found. Wow. Steve's totally freaked out by creepy clowns. No, you know, everybody doesn't like creepy clowns, Michelle. It's not just me. You know, Steve, I think you might be afraid of clowns. I'm not afraid of clowns, alright? The scientific term is coulrophobia and I do not have it because if I did have it, I think I would know it because I am a psychiatrist after all. Steve saw one of those creepy clown videos on YouTube and it totally freaked him out. It did not freak me out, okay? It did not freak me out. I just don't especially like creepy clowns. Okay, they're creapy. Okay, there I said it. It's out on the table and I don't care and I, no offense to Adrien's clown. I think he's kind of sweet, you know and his dog too. I think they just really have a good time together. I hardly think that he is... Okay well, do you have a PhD in psychology? No. Do you have a PhD in psychology? No, I do. So I think I should take control of the situation. Where's my watch? This is gonna get interesting. Let go of your breath a little. One, two, three. One more time. Here you go. Happy birthday. What is this? Is this a magic kit? This is awesome. Thank you mom. This is from your uncle Steve and I. Thank you. Whoa, cool. Are these Rubik's Cubes? - Yes. - This is so cool. Thank you. I used to have a Rubik's Cube well back in the 80s. They broke when I threw it up against the wall repeatedly. Whoa. This is a harmonica. Yeah. Yeah. Whoa, what's this? - Whoa. - Pretty good. This is a magic coin. Will it help me do real magic? This is so cool. So, besides psychotherapy, I practice hypnotherapy. Oh. Yes, we do the whoa, whoa, whoa but the wu, wu, wu. Yeah. You see this watch? I just want you to keep your eyes on this watch, okay. Not that close. Do you see it? Okay, good. Now we're just gonna watch it right from here, okay? Yeah, that's right. It's gonna go back and forth, back and forth. That's right. No, just with your eyes. That's right, go back and forth. Yeah, with your eyes. Watch it go back and forth and back and forth. Soon you will become very relaxed. Soon you will be feeling heavy. Soon you'll be very relaxed. Yeah, soon you'll feel a heavy, sinking feeling wash over you. Soon, your eyelids will become very, very heavy. Your eyelids are becoming so heavy, you cannot keep your eyes open. That's right. Soon, you'll be falling asleep. Falling asleep. That's right. Your mind will be 100% present. Hey mom, do you know where the clown is? I wanna show him this really cool magic trick. I have no idea. Well, I guess I'll go get him. Could I show you a trick? I'm gonna get you. That is not funny. I love the smell of fire roasted marshmallows. You know Adrien, you are learning from the best of the best, here. I was the champion smores maker as a kid. 1987, Johnson State Fair champion. Now the trick is you don't want to get them too close to the fire, right? You wanna let the heat just cook it evenly and slowly. So like, am I doing it right? Yeah, yeah. That's perfect, kid. Slowly turn it. That's right. - Like this? - That's perfect. Oh no. Oh no. Blow it out. Blow it out. - Blow it out. - Careful. Clown, blow it out, blow it out. Just blow it out. Now that just looks like dirt. How about we just play charades instead? You know what, I got a better idea. Hey, Adrien, have you ever been snipe hunting? - Snipe hunting? - Yeah. What's a snipe? You're never heard of snipe hunting? - No. - Oh my God. Okay, come on. Do you know what snipe hunting is? Do you know what a snipe is? We're going snipe hunting. Let's go guys, come on. Put those marshmallows down. We're gonna go catch some snipes. You take these bags. Here's one for you, one for you, clown. Take the bag. Okay, now you hold it all the way forward and yell snipe. Oh, not in the bag. Gotta yell out here, snipe and then you just wait for them to come. Why blindfolded? Because snipes are very shy and nervous creatures. They don't like to be seen. So if you're not blindfolded, they won't come. What do they look like? Well, I hear the very small and fuzzy, just like hamsters, but they have antlers and they have a long, big beak. Really bright green and red wings on their back. They're incredibly rare. So if you do find one, you'll be amazing. You might even be an Internet star. Me? So what do I do? Well, you just hold still and you wait. Okay, now you just bring this all the way down. You've got to hold it open. You've got to shake it a little bit and then the snipe can crawl in. You're ready? All right, so you just remember to yell snipe, okay? Okay. Snipe. - Keep yelling. - Snipe. - Make sure you keep yelling. - Snipe. We'll be waiting for you back at the campfire. Snipe, snipe. Here snipe. Here you are snipe. That was mean. It's his birthday and we all know that there aren't any snipes. So what? Snipe hunting is essential to every child's development. In what way? 'Cause it helps rid them over their childish imagination. Okay, and when they don't catch them? Well then they learn to question truths of reality. I can't believe you're a shrink. That's why became a shrink. To destroy the illusion, right? So people can cope with the realities of the world without in a healthy manner. You must have been a really fun kid. I was, I was pretty fun. Here snipe. Snipe. Snipe. You should see them with their bags. They're like, snipe snipe. - I'm such a bad mom. - No you're not. I mean, all this smores. Now Look, look at us, snipe, snipe, snipe. They're totally buying it. It's great. Snipe, snipe. Snipe. I don't think it's coming. Snipe, snipe. Snipe. Snipe. I think I heard something. Snipe. Snipe, snipe. Snipe, oh my God, here. Yes. I caught a snipe. Mom, I caught a snipe. No way, he can't catch a snipe. - Really? - Okay, great. - Can't catch a snipe. - He caught a snipe. All right, great. I'm coming. Mom, I caught a snipe. Come on, come, on. - Are you sure? - Yeah look. I'll open the bag so you can see it. Be careful, do not scare it. Okay, okay. Snipe was right there. All I see is a rock. It was right there. I saw the snipe. You really think caught a snipe? Yeah, it was all colorful and it had a beak and antlers, just like you said. Right? Yeah. So you're saying that there really was an animal in there? Yeah, and now it's a rock. Do you know what I heard when I was a little girl about snipes? What? I heard that snipes are actually magical creatures and that they can only be seen by certain people. Special people that they like. And if other people come around, they disguise themselves. That's exactly what happens. They turn to stones or pine cones, you know, stuff like that. - Really? - Really? So maybe it turned itself into a rock because it was scared. That's exactly what happened. Hey. - Maybe tomorrow. - Yeah. We'll try again tomorrow. Wow. I think I see the big tipper. Look, right there. Oh, I think I see a shooting star. Make a wish. Adrien, your sleeping bag is ready. Oh, can I just stay for like five more minutes? Honey it's late. Come on, you got to go to bed. All right. Well, good night. Bye, good night. I don't think you need that much, Steve. Encontrare. I remember my summer camp days. Mosquitoes love feasting on my sweet succulent flesh. I had so many bites, the kids thought that I had severe acne then it came later. I haven't seen him mosquito all day. Just wait. Just wait, Michelle, they're there. Just waiting. Just waiting for their opportunity. Evil blood suckers. Sh. Maybe you're allergic to the bug spray. Ow. What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Hey baby. Do you really think Dad's watching over us? I think so. Me too. All right, time to go to sleep, okay? Right. I love you. Happy birthday. - Okay. - Good night then. All right, I'll be back. I'm just gonna step out. I'll be back. - Good night. - Good night, sweetie. I don't know if Adrien told you, but he lost his dad a couple of years ago. Few minutes ago, Adrien just asked me, I thought that his father was watching over us. I said yes, but I don't really know. It's like, I feel so alone. I wanna believe. I really do. I do. Thank you. Sarah. Sarah. Jack. Sarah, Jack. Sarah. Sarah. Sarah. You were just dreaming. You're okay. You were just having a bad dream. Sh. Yeah, you said Sarah, Jack. Jack, do you know who they are? No. You were having a nightmare? - Do you need anything? - I'm okay. I'm sorry, okay. So the purpose of a Rubrik's Cube is to get all the sides the same color. So if you have an orange middle, you have to surround it by orange and then if you have a white middle, you have to surround it by white. Wow. And the same with all the other colors. Adrien, come on, get your stuff. We're gonna go hiking. Yeah, come on. He was gonna show me a trick and we were gonna put on a show for you guys. Yeah. Come on kiddo, don't you want to go hiking with us? No, he was gonna show me a trick and we're gonna put on a magic show for you guys. We're gonna be gone and feel hours at least. But we'll be fine. - I don't know. - Please, please. Please, please, please. Okay, fine. You can stay. Hang on. There's water, there's food in the fridge. The cabin's unlocked. Okay. Yeah. Just gonna rehearse a magic show for us.. Steve, really? Hold on, let me put this on. Oh no. - What is that? - It's a mosquito net. You know, after last night, you can't be too sure. Go ahead and laugh, huh? Who's the one behind the net? I am, that's right, okay. All right, don't go on the wilderness. Okay kiddo. We'll be back. Believe in the impossible. To believe in yourself. Just believe. Studies have shown that positive thinking can be a tremendous force on improving our lives, but believing just takes it to the next level. He's a good influence on Adrien. That's all that matters to me. So expressive, heartfelt. - The magic of makeup. - No, it's not that Steve. It's his eyes. There's a million words in his eyes. I just think he's hiding something. I just thank you're jealous. - Jealous? - Yeah. I'm not jealous. Ladies and gentlemen. And the dog and the clown. Hit it. Clown, Clown are you okay? Okay. Clown, are you okay? Go get some water, okay? Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the boy, the dog and the clown. Thank you all. All right. Bang bang. Good. Yeah, we should reach the peak in about a half a mile. I hope so. - My calves are killing me. - Mine too. You know, you two need to get in better shape. I work out like three times a whoa. - Oh, oh, oh. - What happened? Oh Charlie horse. Ow, ow. You got stuck. Relax, relax, relax. - I'm trying, I'm trying. - Don't try to move it. - Okay. - Don't try to move it. Okay. Try flexing. Flex, flex. - Flex right here. - Yeah. - Yeah I agree. - We should take a breather. Yeah, just a little break right here. No, Foxy, Foxy come back. Foxy, Foxy, Foxy. Foxy, Foxy. No, Foxy, Foxy, where are you? No, Foxy. Foxy. Foxy, Foxy. Oh, it's stunning. That is worth the hike. Yeah beautiful, whatever. Foxy, Foxy, come back, Foxy, where are you? Foxy, Foxy, where are you? Foxy, Foxy. You're gonna be okay, Steve. Should we medevac you out? Here let me see if we have reception. I could do this again tomorrow. Oh, I would love to. You guys don't need to wait up for me, you know - if you wanna go. - Come on. Oh no, wait, wait, wait. I think it's dehydration. Steve, I told you you're potassium deficient. No, I had a banana two days ago, I think. Foxy, Foxy, Foxy. Foxy, where are you? Foxy. Foxy, Foxy. Foxy, Foxy, where are you? Foxy, Foxy, Foxy. It's right around the bend. I'm really proud of you babe. How's your leg? It's still knotted up. I'll get some bengay back at the cabin. Maybe that'll help. - I forgot I had these. - What are these? Midol. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Can't hurt. - That'll work. Hey, wait up. Hey, you know what? I think it's starting to help. Here you go, come on. Come on. - Are those gun shots? - Yeah, it's a shooting range. Seriously Steve? Who books a cabin next to a shooting range? Come on, Michelle booked it. It sounds like it's like miles away. It wasn't in the Yelp review. - Ow. - Oh, oh, can you get it? Okay. - Here. - Ow. - Is that it? - Feel it? Yeah. No, no, not too hard. - Thank you baby yeah. - That's it, right? Yeah, can you feel it? It's like a ball. Oh, that hurts. It feels better now. - No, yeah, yeah. - Okay. Adrien. Is he in the cabin? No, I didn't see the clown either. Adrien, we're back. Adrien. Maybe they went for a walk. - Adrien. - Adrien. Adrien. They were supposed to stay here and rehearse their show. - Adrien. - Adrien. Adrien. Okay, you don't think that... No, no. Foxy, I found you. You found me. Ow. Be careful, there's a rattle snake over there. Careful. Help, mom. I hurt my ankle. I think I sprained it. Ow, ow. Help. I've been thinking, what do we actually know about this clown, huh? Not much. I mean, his behavior could be part of a larger psychological... Oh my gosh, it's starting to rain. - That's thunder. - Mom. Mom. Clown help, mom help. No, I heard him. I heard him this morning yelling names. He yelled out Sarah, Jack, and then when he woke up and I asked him who they were, he said he didn't know and I believe him. What do you mean he didn't know? - No. - That's weird. - Adrien. - Adrien. He was having a bad dream. Hey wait, wait, wait. What's this? Help, help, help. Foxy. Oh, that looks like our clown without makeup. Sarah Wild and her son Jack were killed Saturday night when their car ran a red light and was hit by another vehicle. The reckless driver, husband and father Gabe Wild was unharmed in the accident. Gabe Wild. - Wait, look at this. - His name is Gabe Wild? Harry the Clown. This is the obituary I showed you. I knew it. I knew it, he's suppressing trauma. That's why he has amnesia. I mean, he could be having a mental breakdown. The guy lost a son. Don't move Foxy. You know what, maybe we should call someone. I'm sure things like this happen all the time. People have to get lost, right? All right, you can wait. I can't wait. I have to go try to find him. - All right. - Adrien. All right well, I guess I'll stay here and I'll call a ranger, okay? I'll grab my phone in case you need us. - Okay. - Adrien. Adrien. Adrien. This way. Adrien. Adrien. Adrien. Sh. Adrien. - Adrien. - Adrien. Yes, hi. Yes, I want to report him missing boy and a clown. Yes, a missing boy and a clown. Wait, the clown said I was magical, right? You just have to believe, okay Foxy? Believe, okay? - Hey. - Hello. So what's this about a missing boy and a lost clown? Yeah, he's my nephew. He wasn't missing any as a clown with him. Okay. - How old is the boy? - The boy, he's 10. Okay, 10 years old. And a clown in a clown suit? Yeah, it's a clown, you know, white face, the red nose, the whole deal. And what was the clown wearing? He was wearing the clown stuff, like I just say he has a white face and red nose and I think he had a red jacket, but I mean, how many clowns are gonna be out here? Butterfly. A butterfly. Foxy, there's a butterfly. Oh my God. Whoa. Get help, get help butterfly. Adrien. Just believe. Just believe, right? Come on, let's go. Just follow the butterfly. We're gonna use this. I know it's a whistle, right? But you'd be surprised how well they work out in the woods. They really do draw the attention of lost subjects. - Okay, yeah. - I'm so sorry. No, that works pretty good, I can imagine. - There it is. - What? I know the butterfly will work. There it is, there it is, come on. Mom, anybody? The butterfly, it's here. Oh my, Foxy there's the butterfly. Mom. Mom, are you there? - Adrien. - Help, help. Mom, help. Adrien, oh my God. I also sprained my leg really bad. Don't move, don't move. - Okay. - Ow. It's not broken. You're right, it's just a sprain. Okay. And I also saw bear buried over there. - What? - It passed us. - Where'd you see it? - It went over there. All right. We've got to get you out of here before it comes back. Do not put weight on your left foot. - Come on. - Let's go. Come on, come on. - Where's the clown? - We thought he was with you. No, I didn't see him. I'm sure he is. No but... You still get a very good view of the entire valley from up there. - Is the clown here? - No, we haven't seen him. - Okay. - What happened? All right, he took a tumble. He all right? I'll get the first aid kit. It's his leg? Get on there, I got this one. Let's get your head up here honey. - Okay, careful. - Okay, there we go. What happened to his head? He's bleeding. He took a tumble, just a little strike. - Is he all right? - Yeah. I had it checked out, it's all right. All right. But there's a bear out there, I saw it. I saw a bear out there. - Adrien, it's okay. - The clown is out there. We're gonna find the clown Adrien. I just need you to relax right now, okay? Clown could be in danger. But in saw a bear. The clown is also out there. He's in danger. Adrien, yes. Adrien, Adrien, we're gonna find him. I promise. We're gonna find the clown, I promise. Bears hardly ever attack humans. They're far more afraid of us than we are of them. Is it spelt the right place? Yes. All right, so we have to find a clown now. They're gonna find him. - There's a butterfly. - Where? There's a butterfly, right there. - Look, right there. - I see it. I see it. Looks like the same one. Yeah. What if it knows where the clown is? No Adrien, you have to sit back down. Adrien. What if it knows where the clown is? Adrien, sit back down please. We have to follow it. Come on, we have to follow it. Just don't put weight on your foot. Adrien, please. - Where are you guys going? - The butterfly. Tell me why we're following a butterfly. Just trust me, come on. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. I see it, it's right there. Wait. There, the clown, the clown. Thought you got eaten by a bear. Clown, are you okay? His heart is racing. He's in tachycardia. We have to call an ambulance. No, no. Sh. I'll always be with you. Okay Adrien? Okay. I'll always be with you. - Do you believe? - Yeah. Promise me you believe. I promise. Do you believe? Believe. What the heck? I see them. I can really see them. This is amazing. - They're beautiful. - They're so many. Everywhere. This is so beautiful. This is amazing. This is so beautiful. - Adrien, look. - Whoa. I can really see them. This is incredible. Yeah, they're real. I believe. Truly amazing. Sometimes, just sometimes magic can happen. You just have to believe. That's what a wise clown once told me. As a kid, you can look at the clouds and they become magical lions or bears or faces in the sky. A passing seagull can last an eternity. The endless possibilities ahead and the feeling of the water passing through your toes and fingers is something new. A sensation that you have never felt before. Each and every moment is exciting. Every second is a discovery. Something to look forward to. Magic. But sometimes, just sometimes, it takes two people to simply show each other the true magic. To believe that everything will be okay. Sometimes to believe is the real magic. Magic is real. You just need to believe.
