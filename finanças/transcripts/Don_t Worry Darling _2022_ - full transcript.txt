Straighten up. Good job. So then Bunny said that she wanted to play, which, mm... She's never played tennis before, ever. She has a cocktail in one hand, a racket in the other, and, Jack... she didn't spill a drop. It was... ...quite possibly the sexiest thing I have ever seen. I want to see you in a tennis skirt. God-- Do you think it's true that Frank actually has a tennis court at his house? -We'll find out, won't we? -Yeah. Oh, and babe, tell me... how many people are gonna be at this party, because I need to know how much tuna salad to make. Mm. -What? -Frank doesn't like tuna. -What? -He doesn't like it. -Are you being serious? -Mm-hm. Baby, why didn't you tell me? I was planning on it being the centerpiece to my dish. - Alice, not the centerpiece. - Shut up. Oh, no! Shit. Don't. -Was that a big drill? -Don't. -Was that an explosion? -Don't. -Are those the progressive materials? -Mm-hm. You can tell me. I'm... I'm really discreet. -I can keep a secret. -I'm going to be late. No, wait, you-- You can't... you can't leave. Why not? 'Cause you're not feeling well. -Oh, I'm not? -Yeah, I'm so sorry. I forgot to tell you, but you're not feeling very well. And the only way to cure it is if we stay home all day, and I tend to you and kiss you and cook for-- -Mm-hm. -No. -Bye. -Okay.

Good morning, ladies. Good morning, Shelley. I have some very exciting news. The Victory Project has hired a new employee, Bill Johnson, and I've invited his wife to join us today. Everyone, please give a warm welcome... to Violet Johnson. Welcome, Violet. Let's begin. First position. Remember, ladies, there is beauty in control. There is grace in symmetry. We move as one. Stomach in. Chin up. That's it. Yeah, of course Margaret wasn't in class. I saw Dr. Collins at their house again. No! Honestly shocked Ted still has a job. -Again? -Unwrap it from her neck, Fred! -Yeah. -Oh, my God. - Poor guy. - Oh! I met her. -Mm! -The new wife. Violet. -Mm-hm. -What's she like? She's like a beautiful, terrified, baby deer. Yeah. Apparently, the husband's a real goober. Well, Jack better recruit somebody soon. Please! Dean says Jack's about to get promoted. -I hope so. -Mm-hm. You're gonna be right behind us. What are you making for the party? -My deviled eggs. -Oh, my God. Jack's gonna be CEO. Hold this, please. That's it. - I'm calling Santa. - Uh-oh. -You give me no choice. -Oh, no. I have to call him. I have to! That's why Santa gave me his number. He said I had to call if you were bad. I'm calling him. I wish I had a choice. -Give me that. -But we stopped! - Give me that. No. Give it to me! All that matters is how you respond in those moments.

Ooh, why don't you go find your brother, okay? Okay, you have to stop humming that song. -What is it? -I don't know. I was hoping you could tell me. It's been stuck in my head for days. Maybe it's a children's song. Something your kids sing? Oh, no, I don't have children. -Oh. -Mm. Don't get me started. It's just not what we want. We're having fun. I live next door. You wouldn't believe the things I've heard. It's like they're on a perpetual honeymoon. No, Jack and Alice only have time for each other. It's not what we want. Plus, Bunny's kids like me more than her, anyway. That's true, it's infuriating. I think three is a perfect number. Bill wants four. Well, once you have one, it's all the same. Having a second... Alice, how many babies should Violet have? Oh, at least seven. Christ. Where have you been? I've turned avoiding talking to other people into an Olympic sport. -This place is incredible! -You haven't seen half of it. I could sleep in their bathtub and they'd never find me. I'm sure! Hi! Hey! May we interest you in a cocktail? -Uh, yes, you may. Thank you. -Yes, very interested. -Bye-bye. -Bye. Thank you. -They terrify me. -They're so creepy. I feel like they sleep upside down. -Do they wear matching outfits every day? -Oh! That little weirdo makes the best Manhattan I've ever had. We honeymooned in Sea Island. Oh! - What? - We honeymooned in Sea Island. Seriously? Yeah, did you eat at Dominick's? I was a little nervous. Took a while to get used to things. Yeah. It takes a minute to settle in. -Yeah. -But it gets easier, though. - It does. Yeah. - Well, it-- I'm just really excited to be here. -So excited, I can't even-- -We couldn't tell. To be honest, I've been out of it since we arrived. Yeah. - Bill says it's the jetlag. - Mm-hm. It's all just been a bit of a blur. It's the desert air. You'll get used to it. That's what Dr. Collins said, too. He was so sweet to stop by. - And, Jack, you're... - -I'm a technical engineer. She should come shopping with us. A different department than, uh, Dean and Ted. Yeah, technically a worse, less important department. I haven't really gotten to talk to Frank very much. Frank doesn't have to talk to you. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't-- You have no idea how extraordinary he is. Or what he can do. You're lucky to even know who he is, let alone be standing in his house. I'm just excited. I'm sorry. I was just excited. Okay. - Oh! Guys, guys, guys. Go, go, go, go. - Ooh, here we go. - This way? - Yeah, you should go in front. Gather 'round, everyone. Now, usually, we don't have the opportunity to welcome couples in our home. But on this occasion, we just couldn't wait to celebrate our newest residents. Bill, Violet... I am so happy for you, that you get to learn from my husband... and join this mission and become a part of this family. Frank has built something truly special. What he's created out here, it's... It's a different way. A better way. - And we only have each other-- - Why are we here? Let's go, right now. We shouldn't be here. What was that? Now, now. Margaret and Ted are going through a difficult time. Margaret's question is right. It is the good question to ask. Why the hell are we here? Why, when this landscape can seem so... barren, so hard, so dusty, so... worthless? Why not run? Why not go back to safety, status quo, where it's safe, where we should be? No, I choose-- We choose to stand our ground. Right? To look harder, to dig deeper. To mine that pure, unbridled potential. That gem of limitless and unimaginable value. It's just too easy to get distracted by what seems. Much more difficult, "braver," I would say... to search for what could be. - Dean... - Hm? What is the enemy of progress? -Chaos. -Yes. Nasty word. Chaos. Merciless foe, that chaos. Energy unfocused, innovation hindered, hope strangled, greatness disguised. I see greatness in each one of you. I know exactly who you are. - What are we doing? - Changing the world. - What are we doing? - Changing the world. That's right. I look around, I see another reason why I'm here. Once unfamiliar faces, strangers, one and all, now... one brave family. Men like Dr. Collins. One of our first, who built this community with me. Thank you, Dr. Collins for your vision. And adventurers like Bill, our newest intrepid explorer. This brave, young Robinson Crusoe, who's choosing to join us on this adventure. Bill, thank you for being our partner in this. And thank you, Violet, for being his partner in this. He could not do this without you. All of you wives... We men, we ask a lot. We ask for strength, a shoulder to cry on... food at home, a house cleaned, and discretion, above all else. And that... That's very difficult. You are my rock. I would not be here without you. Thank you. You're all dismissed. ♪ Baby, baby, baby... ♪ Jack? Jack? - Margaret. - They're hiding me in here. Oh, give us a second, Alice. She'll be fine. I'm not fine.

He'll 40-love this look. Oh, yes, yes, yes. Can you charge that to Dean's account? I still can't believe we can just charge, everywhere. Yes, but Victory has things - money can't buy. - Mm-hm. It's true, you don't have to worry about the weather or learning to drive. Ugh. - I love driving. - No. You love Jack teaching you to drive. That's foreplay. Circle back to the guest list. Were Kathy and Bob at Frank's? -I think so. -Really? Wow, so it just seems very random, right? Who is invited and who isn't. It has nothing to do with seniority, or success, or even being well-liked, right? Splish-splash. Who's ready to dive into summer? -Charge that. -Hideous. -I heard Margaret made a scene. -Oh, my God. Threw a drink in someone's face? What? No. That did not happen. She was upset. It was humiliating, and she's gonna get Ted fired. Oh. If Peter got fired... I'd kill myself. Not kidding. Can't live anywhere else. Margaret is just having a really hard time. Whose fault is that? I know. I still feel bad for her. Of course. It was a terrible accident. It wasn't an accident. Bunny, stop. Come on. I don't want to be rude. I know that she was your friend. She was our friend, when she was normal. And then she lost her mind. She took her son out into that desert. - She thought she saw something. - She hallucinated. Well, it wasn't exactly clear as to what... happened. She knew how dangerous it was, just like we all do. The one thing they ask of us is to stay here, where it's safe. But still, she dragged that little boy out into the middle of God-knows-what. If they don't want us going out there, they have their reasons. So when they found her... She was alone. They never found him. Oh. I knew he died, I... I just hadn't realized... She claims they took him to punish her. Boys and their toys. Least we know they're getting work done. What do you think they're really doing out there? -What do you mean? -I mean, I know what they say... You know, "development of progressive materials," But, sometimes Peter insinuates that they're actually making weapons. And that it's all happening underground, -because Frank discovered-- -Peg. Sorry. We're all here because we believe in the mission. Yes. We have jobs too, that are just as important, just as vital. What we do at home, supporting them, taking care of them. Without that, they couldn't be out there changing the world. Mm. Everyone focuses on the sacrifices you make by going after what you want. I want you to focus on the sacrifices you make by standing still. By not going after what you know you are owed by giving up, and taking the smaller version of your life. Sacrifice doesn't just take courage, it takes faith, saying, "I will stand this pain, this hurt, this effort, knowing that what I want is waiting on the other side." It's scary to sacrifice something. But you're sacrificing something more by sitting in that fear.

You wouldn't want me discussing the details of your treatment with my other patients, now, would you? Mm... I wouldn't mind. I would just... I would really love to know the details of... of how you fixed her. Well, as you know, we provide both psychiatric and physical care here. And Margaret was in need of both. The good news is, is that physically, she's fine, but psychologically, she wasn't. She was having significant troubles. Outbursts. Paranoia. She made it impossible for Ted to do his job, so he no longer works for the Victory Project. She needed quite a bit of help. Ah... not like you. No. It's not necessary here.

Jack Chambers, I am honored... to invite you to join our... senior advisory board. Are you the man that you say you are? It's a good fit. Thank you for your loyalty. More good things to come. How 'bout that, ladies and gentlemen. You wanna see the boy dance? Look at this boy dance! Come on! Come on! Look what he can do! - Don't say that. You're gonna get another job. - Alice! Hey. What's wrong? Honey. What happened? What's wrong? It's extraordinary! Everything's fine. It's okay. Bunny, we need to go. We need to get out of here right now. -No, no, no. We're okay. -We need to go. We're okay. Come on. Tell me, what happened? How about that, huh? You watching him dance? Margaret was right. She was asking questions that they don't want us to ask. And so they silenced her. She didn't slip. It wasn't an accident. I saw it happen. I saw her fall. They're lying about everything. Dance, Jack! Let's make him spin, shall we? And so I went out there, and I saw it. You went-- you went out where? Yeah, that's it! Come on, boy, faster! Keep it going! Come on! Come on! Yeah! That's it! Ha-ha! Doesn't that make you believe? Stand up! Stand up, take a bow! Take a bow, you deserve it! And when I touched it, I saw something. And I keep remembering more. And I heard Frank's voice, and he's in my head-- It's more than just a celebration of our freedom from society's arbitrary regulations, it's a celebration of potential unleashed! It's a reminder of who we are! Can I just show you? Let's just go out there. Everybody will be distracted right now. We can take Dean's car. -We can head to-- -Stop. Stop. Stop it! -Have you lost your mind? -What? You went to Headquarters? -Because I thought I saw a plane crash. -It is the one rule... - No, I know-- - ...they ask us to respect. You know how dangerous it is. We are not going backwards. We're pushing forwards, yes? We move! -You stole from Dr. Collins? -Because Margaret can't be okay! Get a hold of yourself, Alice! You are behaving like a child. Your husband is out there having the most important night of his life. He's being celebrated, and you're in here trying to ruin it? No! No! You sound exactly like Margaret! Whose world is it? Ours! Whose world is this? Ours! - Whose world is this? - Ours! Whose world is this? Ours! - Whose world is it? Ours! - Ours! - Whose world is it? Ours! - Ours! Whose world is it? - Ours! - Ours! - Whose world is it? Ours! - Ours! - Whose world is it? Ours! - Ours! They're calling it Operation Extract. It's higher security clearance. I'm gonna be heading the whole thing myself, which is a real vote of confidence from Frank, I think. ♪ See the pyramids ♪ ♪ Along the Nile ♪ - Welcome! - Welcome! There he is. Oh, my. Those are beautiful. Come on in. Come on in. I want it for you. Thank you. Are we late? I feel like we're late. We literally are arriving at the same time. What are these platters? Wow! Whatever's going on here, I love. I love. You like it? -Yeah, the decor is-- -I'm glad, Bill. I'm glad. All right, buddy, tell me the truth. Is he really coming? This is for you. I think he's coming. How the hell did you get Frank to come to your house? It wasn't me. It was Alice. These are the perks. I get it. This is how you're living. Is everything in this house from the catalogue? It's a house. Show me the ring. Let me see it. Did we beat Bunny? Uh, she... she's not coming. - Hm. - Told you. -Sorry, boys. Can I just get... -Yeah, yeah. You know, it's a good thing you can dance, 'cause you're so hideously unattractive. - They're here! - How many secrets do you-- Thank you. - It's good to see you. -Wow. I knew it. I told Peg. It's gonna be a no-tie event. -Frank. -Jack! You crazy son of a bitch! What do you want me to do with this? Hold on to it. I told her it was gonna be like a casual thing. -Put that on ice. -Wow. -Thanks for coming. -I'm proud of you. -Thank you. -What a lovely home, by the way. Jack, could you make Shelley a cocktail? Of course. Hey, Frank, that was a hell of a party last night. It was. I'm trying to get my wife into a martini glass. -He liked that. -No, he didn't. - Where's your drink? - It's right here. Cheers! Cheers. It's a wonderful home. -How are you? -Me? -I'm amazing. -Mm-hm. After the night Jack had, I'm incredible. Right. Of course. Cheers. Thanks for coming. - You were a triumph last night. - Oh! We haven't stopped talking about you. You guys go now and enjoy yourselves. I'm gonna go back to the plates and finish up, -and, um, I'll see you in-- -Can I help you? -No, no, no, no, go. -You sure? Okay. Promise. Go snoop. I love this record player. -You do? You like it, Bill? -I love it. At my house, I have a bench. How did you get... You can probably tell by now that appetizers are where I really express myself and buck convention. It's a skill. Maybe you can teach me sometime. Can't be taught. I learned something very exciting. Oh, really? What's that? Rumor is you and Jack are trying. Oh, well... - We'll see. - Mm. Hope we'll see a little boy. I'm sorry Bunny didn't believe you. But then again, you didn't believe Margaret, so... why should anyone believe you? My God, you fascinate me. Because I've been waiting for someone like you. Someone to challenge me. No great man has changed the course of history without being pushed to the limits of his potential. And you push me. Yeah. I do hope you keep going. And yet, here you are. Preparing dinner. Like a good girl. - Sit. - Absolutely. Do you know if it's a boy or a girl? No, I hope it's a boy. Thank you. - Can't get enough of 'em, right? Girls are hard. They are. -I'll be right there, all right? -Thank you. You know, Alice tells me you're a hell of a tennis player. -Oh, she does? -Is that right? Yeah. She's being polite. Well, we're looking for some fierce competitors. If you're ever ready to get out there, call me. I've heard about that backhand, though, it's famous. If you want a partner, I'm yours, man. That's a lot of pressure. I don't know if-- Thank you. I'm having the fish. I don't know what you guys are having. Nice to see a familiar face. Um, so anyways, those windows right there, the slatted windows? They're actually called "jalousie" windows. Did you know that? - You didn't know why. - Oh, boy. So, the etymology is... ..."jealousy." And you say, "Whose baby is this?" And they say, "It's your baby." And you say, "How could that be?" And it is your baby. And I just do it every year. Violet, where are you from? -Pardon? -I said, "Where are you from?" Philadelphia. - Mm! I'm from Philadelphia! - Are you serious? -I didn't know that. -I knew I liked you. Most of the women here are from Philadelphia. Or Baltimore. Or Chicago. I've noticed. Mm. Can I get anyone anything? I for one do not miss the winters. No, no, no. I thrive in the sunshine, even though I'm alabaster-skinned. I love the sunshine. I love the beach. - Mm. - She does. What was the last beach you went to? Oh, fun fact about the beach. -I read this. -Yeah? Beaches are actually some of the filthiest places in the whole world. - Just a sandbox of disease and-- - Peter! Do not say "disease" at the dinner table. It's true. They need to know. I can probably guess. Hilton Head? Cape Cod? Or the Jersey Shore? And we all honeymooned in Sea Island, or the Poconos, or Niagara Falls. I think those are popular honeymoon destinations. -Expensive. -Mm-hm. Beautiful, beautiful. Peter, you, uh... you haven't finished your story. Mm! Bill over here's probably -one of the worst golf players-- -I'm sorry, Peter. I'm not quite finished. Violet, where did you meet Bill? Well, we met on a train. - To Boston. - To Boston. Yeah. Yes. You dropped your ticket. And he bent down, picked it up, gave it to you, right? It is, yeah. That's how Margaret met Ted. And Peg, am I right in thinking that's how Debbie McIntyre met her husband? Yes, I am. That's how they met. - Yes, that's true. I'm jealous. - Is it? - Honestly, it's such a sweet story. - -Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that funny, the way those coincidences-- Incredible. There are only so many different stories we're told. We're told what we remember. Until... we try to remember things... that they want us to forget. -Like Margaret. -Alice... No. Jack. It's okay. I'm curious to hear where she's going with this. Frank is doing something to us. Delusions, memory problems, hysteria. We saw these issues with Margaret, and know that it's, uh, completely curable. Dr. Collins prescribed you a suite of medications, which you are clearly not taking. The question is why... He's lying to us. He's lying to all of us. Bunny, your best friend, is worried about you. She thinks that you need help. Is that why she's not here tonight? Because you didn't want to be reminded of that. He's using you. He's using all of us. Do you even know what the Victory Project actually is? -Have you ever asked? -Do you? Is that why you went out there? To Headquarters? What? -I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. -Alice... But you don't know what he's doing. You wandered out by yourself. You ignored every rule. And she put all your lives in danger. Yes, I did go out there and I went to Headquarters and I saw what he's hiding. - What I'm hiding. - He's lying to us. - Oh, dear. - -He's lying to all of us about what the Victory Project actually is. - He's trapped us here. - Alice... Trapped? I hope no one feels trapped. Do you feel trapped? Violet? Peg? This is your psychosis. You are experiencing trust as a feeling of entrapment, yet you trust every day. We all do. Tonight, you've trusted us in your home. Just like I trusted you in my bedroom. Alice? Do you remember that? He's... he's trying to create a world. -If you want to articulate your own argument... -He's using us. -try using your own words, Alice. -He's using all of us. -In your own words! -What's in this food? Let's talk about that! - Where did it come from? Huh? - Oh, I'm sorry, everyone. -I'm sorry. -Let's just think about it. - I'm sorry, Violet. - Victory milk. - This is... this is an anomaly. - Victory meat. Victory eggs. - It doesn't usually happen. - It all comes from him. She's very sick -and she will get the help that she needs... -Everything we're told... -...I promise you both. -...everything we are given comes from him! And it's all about control. It's all about control. We wouldn't even-- He might be poisoning the food! Enough! We come to your house, we sit at your table, and you insult and degrade my husband? He invites you to be a part of something as extraordinary as he is, and you sit there like a spoiled brat, demanding answers to questions you've made up. There's a pattern, isn't there? A pattern of selfish, pampered whining. Or is it just a desperation to be exciting? Hm? Spitting in the face of this opportunity. It's heartbreaking that your sad, desperate paranoia could destroy what we're trying to build. Hm? Well, I won't listen to your pathetic ranting any longer. Frank, honey? I'll be in the car. Well... Jack, I think you may have overserved your wife. Thank you. I was expecting so much more from you. Good luck, Alice. Jack, let's talk. Did you enjoy yourself tonight? What? No, I didn't enjoy myself tonight. You planned a whole evening to sabotage me. No! No, I would never do that to you. I would never do that to you. I love you. I'm trying... I'm trying to save us. You're trying to save us by going out there. Yes, because I saw a plane crash. I told you. But, Jack, everything I said at that table is true. Frank even admitted it to me. He admitted it to me in the kitchen. That's why I did that. That's why all of that happened. He wouldn't have done that. Jack... Everyone is acting like I'm crazy. And I'm not crazy. And I need you to listen to me. I need you to listen to me. Hey. Hey. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Look at me. To me... you are... you are bigger than all of this. Mm-hm. You are bigger than Victory. You are bigger than Frank. I believe in you. I believe in you. I don't believe in him. And I don't trust him. And I don't trust this place. And I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to be here anymore. And we need to leave. We need to leave. And we can go anywhere. We can go anywhere and we can create our own world, and it will be you and me and we'll be okay. And it's not about where we go, it's just that we're together. Please? Please? Please? Please? Please. Okay. Okay? Okay. Okay? Okay. I love you. I love you. But we need to go tonight. We need to go. We can't be here. Hey. Hey. I love you. Let's go. I love you. -Okay. -'Kay. Okay. Jack? I packed us a snack in case we drive all night long, but I think I packed everything. Let's go. Baby, let's go. Come on. I'm sorry. What? I love you so much, Alice. Baby, what's wrong? I tried so hard to keep this from happening. -What? Let's-- -Please believe... Baby, we need to go. We need to go. Baby, you need to drive. We need to go. Go. Whoa. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -No. No! No! -I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Alice. -No, Jack, please! I can be better! -I can be better! I'm so sorry! -Alice, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! -Let me be better, please! -I'm sorry! -I'm sorry! I'm sorry! -Baby, please! -Let me be better. -I'm sorry! -Get off me! -I'm sorry! I'm sorry! -Let me be better! -I'm sorry. -I'm so-- -Jack, please! They're hurting me! No! No! No! Jack! They're hurting me! They're hurting me! Fuck! Fuck! No, please, please.
