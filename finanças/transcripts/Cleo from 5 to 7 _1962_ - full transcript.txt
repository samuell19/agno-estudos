Cut the deck, Miss. Choose nine cards with your left hand. I know... three for the past, three for the present, three for the future. - You're familiar with tarot? - A bit. You haven't appeared yet. The cards speak better if you appear. Here you are. That's better. Let's look at the past. Your young lover influenced your career or taught you to sing. - Was your mother a widow? - No. Then you have a widow near you. She gives unscrupulous advice. - But she's devoted to you. - That's true. She made you leave your hometown for a freer life. As a result, you met a kind, generous man. He made your artistic career possible. I see you have some talent. You're in music, perhaps? Or else you like music. He pays much attention to you. - He's kind, but I see him rarely. - Better replace him. Pick a new card. This one represents you. A man's looking after you, though, and gives you sound advice. - I see evil forces, a doctor... - Yes, yes. His task is hazardous. I see changes, a struggle. Now for the future. This isn't a very good card. You've little hope of marriage. I see a journey... here are the three Fates. - That's you there. - Why am I there? The cards are difficult to read. Let's try another spread. Cut, please. Take four cards. The hanged man... that confirms change. But this indicates suffering. - Are you ill? - Yes. Here you are. Venus Astarte! Illness is upon you. - Yes, me! - I see a new acquaintance. You'll meet a young and talkative fellow who'll amuse you. I didn't see him up to now. There's something wrong. An upheaval... it's your illness. I knew it! It's serious, isn't it? Yes, but don't make too much of it. Take another card. We must see... I see. Thanks. You're wrong, it's not necessarily death. The hands and feet are fleshy. It's a total transformation - of your entire being. - Enough! I've known for two days. I don't need the test results. And my hand? - I can't read palms. I don't know. - Is it that bad? There's no need to cry like that, dear. What will my other customers think? I don't bring bad omens. I understand. The cards showed death, and I saw cancer. She's doomed. CHAPTER 1 Hold on, pretty butterfly. Ugliness is a kind of death. As long as I'm beautiful, I'm more alive than others. Take a look at our dresses. I was gone for a moment. Did Madame Irma rid you of your fears? No. It's worse than before. The cards said I was ill. - She saw that in the cards? - Is it written on my face? No! You're imagining things. If it is, I'll kill myself. I might as well be dead already! CHAPTER 2 What a drama queen. She's got everything she needs to be happy. Bu! she needs to be cuddled like a child. Cléo, my little girl. Calm down. What's up, little lady? - She's fretting over a medical test. - Is she ill? Doctors see illness everywhere. Always ordering tests. It's all the rage. - You said it! - Yes, yes. She's feeling faint. Are you OK? - Do you want a cognac or a coffee? - Yes, a coffee. You know very well coffee will excite you even more. No coffee. - All right, then. A coffee. - OK. Life justifies our desires. Coffee can agitate you one day and calm you the next. What was bad for you one day does you good the next. I'll tell you a true story about my village. I'm from Les Causses. There was a man with everything a vineyard, a wife, children, good health. Health is everything. One day he fell ill. The doctor said he'd die. His wife put on a widow's airs. He got angry, got out of bed, all feverish, asked for some coffee. He wanted to go out. He paced around his room and said... - Don't you rent your room? - ..."I'm a bit sleepy, but tomorrow..." It's your place, isn't it? You don't understand. I'm sick of leaving at two in the morning. I'm tired out the next day. Either I sleep with you or nothing. Then nothing. Are you kidding? I'm tired as well. I have my pride. You'll come running. Bye. Sitting alone on his chair, silently... He visited Greece, Turkey, Egypt, Africa, and sent postcards saying, "I'm seeing the world". He never mentioned his illness. Two years later, he returned stronger than ever, very proud. His wife had died in an accident. He's an old man now, still in the village. He still talks about his travels. The highlight of his life. Doctors talk you into dying. What do we owe you? We've got to run. - No, no, the drinks are on the house. - You're kind. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I want that one. - Fur? At this time of year? - Yes! - How may I help, ladies? - I'd like a hat. Could I try some? Certainly, Madame. What kind would you like? This one, this one, that one... This one's very smart on you. Like it? That's a summer hat at least. Not at all. Capricious! CHAPTER 3 Everything suits me. Trying things on gives me a thrill. Black definitely becomes me. But all the same I prefer the first one. It suits you very well, Madame. - This is the one, then. - Good. - Would you like it wrapped or in a box? - I'll wear it now. You can't wear it on a Tuesday! Nothing new on Tuesdays. - But a hat? - Nothing new. Would you like a box? - Are you trying to attract bad luck? - No. Thank you, ladies. Never even carry new things on Tuesdays. Please deliver it to Cléo Victoire, 6 Rue Huyghens. It's her! It's you! Oh, Miss, I just love your voice. I never thought I'd meet you. - Could Miss sign a photo for our shop? - Of course. - Deliver it at once, won't you? - Of course. Good bye. Not that one. The number's unlucky. This one. - It's a DS, I like these. - It's not a DS, it's an ID. - ID as in "a funny idea"? - That's it. Are you tired? - Yes, I feel like I've no life in me. - Don't be silly. You're just tired. Do you live with your parents? Give us a smile. You're stuck-up! - Do you like music? - Of course. Not this one. It's awful! The recording's awful. They should redo it. Stop it! Please stop! No, I meant turn the music off! - It's me singing. - Is that you? I love that song. - You don't hear it much. - Yes, you do. What's wrong, Madame? I feel nauseous. But the windows are open. - Doesn't the music help? - No. I like the radio. - Like "Radio Taxis", it gives us work. - Tough job for a woman. Sometimes a bit dangerous too. But I like it. - Aren't you afraid at night? - Afraid of what? What's going on? Art students are blocking the street. CHAPTER 4 They're only having fun. We were the same in our day. I don't like trouble. I was attacked last winter. My photo was in the evening papers. Not exactly attacked. Some youngsters wouldn't pay. It was a deserted spot, and pitch-black. But I didn't let them get away. - In the dark? - Then they hit me. I called for help over my radio. Two colleagues came almost straightaway. - Weren't you scared to death? - I don't scare easily. - What did they steal? - Nothing. They ran off. What a story! I can't pass here. I'll put the radio on if you don't mind. Sure, it's your taxi. A new whisky shampoo for American women. "It's fabulous," says the ad. Whisky revitalises the hair. - 5:20 pm. Here's the latest news. - Today brought more rioting in Algeria. The latest casualty figures 20 dead and 60 wounded. In Paris before a military tribunal, Commander Robin, part of the putsch in Algiers, was sentenced to six years in prison. Other political concerns, the farmers' unrest has lasted a fortnight. Today they broke police barriers in Poitiers. 2,000 reached the town hall with 300 tractors. Tomorrow two farming leaders will be tried. They're being held in a Brest prison. Yesterday, 4,000 workers and farmers in St Nazaire shouted, "Free the Bretons". On the international scene, did Khrushchev feel he put Kennedy in the doghouse? After the Vienna conference, he sent a dog to the White House, one of the puppies of the famous space dog Strelka... - We'll be home in time for the rehearsal. - I'm exhausted. - You'll have time to rest a bit. - Clear skies for the Tour de France. Three workmen in Gennevilliers sewers were knocked out by leaking gas and swept away by the main sewer, along with a Metro worker trying to save them. Tourists, be advised, the Fontainebleau museum will be closed again tomorrow, June 22nd. After her last operation, Edith Piaf has taken her first steps. Dr Mercadier, her surgeon, said yesterday "Edith is saved again. She's come a long way". A young Englishman, Robert Platten, crossed the Channel in 6 hours 20 minutes on a brass bed, mounted on floats... Do you know Rue Huyghens? It's after the Vavin crossroads. - I know it. - An easy street to find. - You're sharp. You've got guts. - It's 5:22pm. What about women parachutists? How crazy to jump like that! Some people like it. What can you say? How much is it? Four francs. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - What a character! - It shocks me. Not me, she's courageous and charming. I feel stifled. Go and hang yourself up. You'll feel better. That hurts. But it does me good. Now that I'm stretched, I'll stretch out. - That always makes me laugh! - I say it every day. You're my best audience. - I'd like a hot water bottle. - Right away. The water's on already. Thanks. I'm not in pain, but the heat does me good. Rest till they get here. You know? - See? - They're on time for once. Don't mention your illness. Men hate it. CHAPTER 5 Yes, sir. She's here. She's upstairs. How are my kittens? Madame, it's Monsieur. Am I allowed to drop by unannounced for a kiss? - I was nearby. - I'm glad you did. - The hat! - What a fuss! You know we're superstitious. If Monsieur came more often, he'd know that. - If the maid fusses, Madame may too. - No time. My musicians are coming. Me neither. I'm swamped. I wanted to kiss you, for a moment. You always say a moment. You're the momentary lover. So cruel. I thought you loved me. It upsets me to give you so little time, my divine... My Cleopatra. - Are you ill? - Yes. - What's wrong today? - Why today? Am I ill that often? You've always got something wrong somewhere. You're strong. Your beauty is your health. What if I really were ill? You've got too much imagination. People's heads are filled with ideas of cancer and heart trouble today. My head's filled with work, meetings and phone calls. That's my illness. I've two meetings before dinner. - I'll never make it. - What? - Never kiss me? Exactly. - Do you miss me? - Yes, like missing a train. - There's a saying: kiss and miss. Not enough kissing and you'll miss me. Let's laugh about it. But you have to take me out. I've a lovely new dress for the "Don Juan" premiere. - Like to see it? - Yes. No. I don't have time. Nor do you. I'll phone you. If only we could holiday together... The Dambrets have gone to Italy, you know. I'll do my best to keep Friday for you and we'll go out. If all goes well, yes. My pearl. What was it? They delivered the furry hat. - Well, Angéle... - Well, Madame... - I didn't mention my worries. - Well done. He doesn't take me seriously. I'm tired of his meetings. I'd like to drop him! That's a mistake. He loves you. Think so? Not a bit. He loves me... a little... a lot... Do you think he loves me? He's a good lover. How do you know? He's in love. He spoils you, respects you, takes you out. He knows everyone in Paris. He's generous. You look good together. He's tall. - True. But I would've liked to tell him. - Tell him what? My illness, of course. Have you forgotten? I'm the only one concerned. Shouldn't he have felt something was wrong? He's an egotist. Yes, Madame. All men are egotists. Yours too. He tells you about his work, his troubles. What about yours? I'm so sweet to him. Always free when he wishes... well dressed, my hair done up. I'm too good to him. You're not hard enough on him. He's too sure of you. He doesn't even ask if I feel well. If I died, he'd be stunned, not even sad. - What are you thinking? - People die suddenly nowadays. Especially artists. Don't talk like that. Don't tempt fate. Let's not speak about the worst or the best. You're fretting unduly. Shall I see your doctor? - No. I have to phone him tonight for the results. - If it were serious, he'd have put you to bed. No... why? - When will you phone? - This evening. Here they are. Let them in. CHAPTER 6 - Hello, Bob. - Hi, Angéle. The shy Maurice, glad to see you. - Is Cléo in? - On her bed. - She sleeping? - She ill? - A little. - Serious? She just wants attention! We'll cure her... with music. - Have you got a white coat? Or an apron? - Behind you. On the wall. Perfect. And with your silly raincoat, you can be the pharmacist. What do you want? I don't know... I'm looking for something. What thing? Here. That's your syringe. - Have you any herbal tea? - Herbal tea? I always make Cléo laugh. Women love to laugh. You're always playing pranks. # The doctor's here, Madame! # # To cure the patient! # What's wrong? Ready to be bled? How horrible! Take it away or I'll faint! Up with the corpse. You're mad, sick in the head. You're the sick one, my beauty. Don't waste your time. Or time will waste you. He's so ugly! "Ugliness is beauty. Beauty is ugliness." Shakespeare. - I was so ashamed. I failed to amuse you. - Thank you, thank you. What's this latest caprice? The recordings next week. Why the sudden rush? Things have changed. I'll record the new songs. Then I'm off. On a fake honeymoon? Mystery. You get on my nerves! Let's rehearse the old numbers. What about the new ones? - Still racking my brain... pen in hand. - The author has spoken! - I call him "Pen-in-Hand"! Not bad? - It suits him. Nice place here. I haven't been before. That's true. Drink, anyone? Madame Angéle's an angel! The author's ideas are dandy. How about a brandy? Who makes the bad rhymes? - Me, officially! - Whisky! - Am I silly? Water and strawberry! - Jingle! # Cléo, is the key on the hook? # - # Cléo... # - You always get on my nerves. I'm tired. - I only want to help. - Thanks. - Out with it, then. - "The Tease". You know that one. # See Dr Song, he'll help and guide you... # # He's a physician, quite Christian... # You're tiresome! There's the one you dislike and "Diverse Woman". That's a nice one! - # There's one woman, there's ten women # - # A thousand women in me... # - I know that one. Not now. - Shame. I never tire of hearing it. - Here, Mr. - Thank you, Madam. Finished? I'm waiting for his new songs. Here's "The Liar". Listen. # I lied to you # # I knew exactly who you were your incognito made me smile # # And your bank account fumed me on... # # The lady's man was just paying # # While I lured you in # # And lied to you... # Yes? She's not in. Call back tomorrow. - It's too hard to sing. I'll never manage it. - Well. No, it's old-fashioned. The first tune's better. More... - Distinctive. - I'll learn it, then. - What else? - "I Play". - Play what? - It's a song. Perfect for you. Easy as pie! # He plays the cello you play the piano # # And I, and I, I play at batting my eyes # # It's crazy how I bat my eyes # # You play the piano, the white and black keys # # And I, and I, I play at swaying my hips # # It's crazy how I sway # # He plays the horn and you play the banjo # # And I, and I am cheek to cheek with you... # # He plays at gambling and you play the shrewd one # # I don't give a damn, I cheat... # That's a nice little song! The lyrics are catchy. - Not the music? - Yes, the music too. You used to appreciate me and my music. That tune you liked, Pen-in-Hand wrote lyrics. CHAPTER 7 - That's sweet. - Just sing the lyrics. - It's "Cry Of Love". - Naturally, sing it with more... Stop it! You're always putting down my talent! - What talent? - That's the limit. - He's just bitter. - # Cleopatra, I worship you # # With all the doors flung open # # The wind rushing through # # I'm like an empty house # # Without you, without you # # Like a deserted isle # # Covered by the sea # # My sands slip away # # Without you, without you # # Beauty wasted # # Naked in the cold of winter # # Just a yearning body # # Without you, without you # # Gnawed by despair # # A corpse in a crystal bier # # Wrinkles everywhere # # Without you, without you # # If you come too late # # I'll be buried in the ground # # Alone, ugly, ashen # # Without you, without you... without you # It's too much. I can't go on. It's horrible! - What's up with her? - She's tired. - Besides, the word "despair" is a bad omen. - A word's nothing. Just a rhyme. It's a beautiful song. - It'll revolutionise the music business. - What's a song? How long does it last? - Another caprice! - Caprice, caprice, that's all you ever say! You make me capricious. Either I'm an idiot or a china doll, and now I'll have a hit with macabre words! Where are the charming songs? Can that be a hit? Yes, like a successful funeral! You unnerve me to exploit me. Get out! No, I'm getting out! Angéle will serve you. Rehearsal is over! - Leave the songs, I'll choose later. - But you can't read music. You never taught me. You don't think I have talent. José liked my voice the first time he heard it. - Your voice? Don't make me laugh! - You must hate me! Another trick so we'll say, "I love you". Spoilt child. Everyone spoils me, no one loves me. What a state! I'm putting on black. It goes with your songs. "Cry Of Love". Alone, ugly and ashen! That's it. If only I could pull my head off too! Shall I come? No! I want to be alone. Cléo, don't forget it's Tuesday. Damn Tuesday! I'll do as I like. GOOD HEALTH Health Food That unchanging doll's face, with that ridiculous hat. I can't see my own fears. I think others look at me. I look at no one but myself. It wears me out. "The frogs don't suffer. They'll see the light of day." Come here, froggy. Time to change aquariums. Third frog. And one! And two! CHAPTER 8 These crazy Algerian events... Their damned politics! Where does that leave our painting now? # I may have talent # - # But he's not gallant # - I gave my conference there yesterday. 15 to 20 years before surrealism. It's too noisy with that music. I can't hear a word. - Honestly, we can't live near them. - They're just impossible. Just like that with you or with everyone? With everyone. Can I buy you a drink? Waiter, a cognac. After all these years here I am back in this café. - It was something. - The decadence of poetry is awful. You have no idea. - Such stories, we don't understand. - What stories? I don't give a damn. At last, Pauline. - Is the cognac for you? - Yes, thanks. The painting's called "Woman". - I see a bull. That proves Miró's Spanish. - When Picasso paints owls as women... What does that prove? Do you think I've got all day to wait for you? - Good models are rare these days. - We should try again. What happened to that fat black girl who posed for the sculptors? We don't see her much these days. - She's back in Africa. - Racist! - Dorothée still around? - Yes, she's a wonderful model! Never any trouble. Look closely, there's nothing up my sleeve. Hi! Cléo's come here. CHAPTER 9 - She's so kind, so beautiful. - Almost done. Wait a minute. That's all for you today. - How are you? - It's been ages. I'm fine. We never saw her friend again. Not bad, but it's a bit heavy. Get rid of that. - Your pay. - Thanks. See you tomorrow. - Bye, Mr Couturier. - Bye, darling. - Good evening, everyone. - Bye, gorgeous. Let's go the back way. I've got Raoul's car. I've been here, but never inside before. They're so calm, attentive. - You really don't mind posing? - No, why? I'd feel more naked than naked in front of those people. - They might see a flaw. - Nonsense! It's nothing. My body makes me happy, not proud. They're looking at more than just me... A shape, an idea... It's as if I wasn't there. It's like sleep. And I'm paid for it. - Where are you going? - For a walk. - Alone? That's unlike you. - See? I'll take you with me. Raoul's lent me the car. Come with me. - Can you drive? - Not very well. I've just learned. Sit down. Fasten your seat belt and chew gum, it's safer! Why do we meet so rarely? When you laugh, it brings back the old days, old hopes... Me a dancer, you a singer, Bob a jazz pianist. Only you've had success. I've only done three singles! I put one on in the Dôme Café just now. - No one listened! - The Dôme isn't a concert hall. Departure Street. The street names around here aren't very inspired. Departure Street, Arrival Street. Stick your arm out. We're turning. Streets should have living people's names. Piaf Street, Aznavour Avenue. They could change the names when they die. - I see. You're hoping for a square! - It's too late for me. What's with you? You're odd. - I'm ill. - Ill? seen a doctor? - They took tests. It's serious. - How serious? - Incurable or something. - My God, how awful! - You're brave. - On the contrary! But you didn't say anything. - How long have you known? - It's not certain. I'll call tonight. - You scared me. Maybe it's nothing. - It's serious, whatever it is. I heard them talking at the hospital. - The patients there know a lot. - Why go to the hospital? My specialist works there. - Where's the illness? - My stomach. - I'd rather there than elsewhere. - Why? At least you can't see it. - No one suspects... - Oh, hush! What does José say? He doesn't know. I don't see much of him. - Don't you talk in bed before you go to sleep? - No. He seldom sleeps at my place. - He's got lots of work. - I thought he adored you. He does. Love is all you need to confide. I thought you were so safe and close to him. I didn't want to intrude. - What about Angéle? - She's worried, but thinks it's not serious. What a story! I'm bowled over! I have to brake. This is it, here. Wait. I won't be long. Think of something else a minute, while I'm gone. Count the sailors' pompoms. Was that quick enough? - Six pompoms. Two nuns. - Raoul needs his film. Step on it. I'm not used to fourth gear yet. I just barely got my licence. I get around in taxis, it's not bad. You're a spoilt child. Earlier, I saw a guy piercing his arm. It turned my stomach. What a day! I feel out of it. Can you give me a hand? We don't have to carry it up. Just take it out and stash it. Here we go. - Does it hurt? - No, no. Raoul! He can't hear a thing! Raoul! Raoul! CHAPTER 10 Watch the wire. - Here's my doll. - Your baby doll. It's been ages, Cléo. How are you? Just in time for the short I told you about. - Have a seat. - I'm only passing by. Cléo's ill. Hope it's not serious. Sit down. A laugh's good for any illness. Just for a moment. I've got to run, and Cléo's not well. Thank you, I'm fine. "Goodbye, Anna!" "Goodbye, Anna!" "Too late!" "To my Baby Doll" "Poor young man..." "Handkerchief, anyone?" "Ah! My glasses made everything look black!" "Damned sunglasses!" Oops, the lights! It's the interval. Your film's downstairs. Did you two carry it? Great! Papers and keys. - Don't want to keep them? - Driving at night's too hard. Coming? - Thanks for the show. - Any time. See you tonight, love. CHAPTER 11 It's an omen of death. How awful. Don't believe such things. It's no worse than breaking a plate. - I'm overcome with fear again. - Come on. I'm really late. - Say something. - Let's get a cab. I'll drop you off. Oh, that's great. What's happened? - Seems a man's been killed. - Could somebody tell me? I'd like to know. No one's safe nowadays. What times we live in. Come on, let's go. I'm so shaken up. Relax now. The broken mirror was surely for that dead person. - You said you didn't believe. - I don't, but you do. Other people's fears frighten me. Why are you carrying your hat? - To annoy Angéle. - Why? No special reason. - It's not even a summer hat. - All winter I hoped to buy one like that. - You want it? It's yours. - No... Well, yes! I'd really like it. Thanks. - Montsouris Park is nearby. Know it? - No. Montsouris makes you smile when you say it. Like "cheese". There are lots of art studios here. Artists and students come to this garden. There's even a waterfall. We're almost where I get out. It's just after the lights. See those stairs? I'll get out here. Thanks, Cléo. - Let me know how it goes. - Goodbye. Slowly, please. - And now? - Straight on. - Now? - Still straight on. Into the park. - Can I? - It's open. It must be a through road. Anyway, if we get stopped, it won't be the death penalty. - What's that? - The Observatory. - Of "The Thousand and One Nights"? - Hun? Here's fine. What do I owe you? Music! # My precious, so capricious body # # The azure of my brazen eyes # # My alluring figure is the bait # # Sure never to deceive # # He yearns for my pleasures # # The flavour of my luscious lips... # - Like the sound of water? - Yes. - It's quiet here, isn't it? - Yes, it is. All the kids have vanished. - Vanished? - It's full of them most days. - And today? - They're all at the other end. They've gone to see the workmen at the pond. - There's plenty of running water here. - But current stuff is more amusing. What's amusing is that you should know. I'm curious. Why don't you go and look, then? I'm more lazy than curious. I believe without seeing. Anyway, I prefer being here. It's cool. Aren't you cold? - It's not too warm. - I'm all right. It's the first day of summer. For me, summer's holiday time. That's all. Today it's officially summer. It's Flora. It's you. - What talk! - I like talking. Aren't you interested to know today is the solstice? The longest day of the year. - The longest. That's for sure! - Today the sun leaves Gemini for Cancer... Stop your gibberish. Shut up! Excuse me. CHAPTER 12 - Going? - Yes. - I'm sorry my information bored you. - One more thing. The time. - I don't have a watch. About six or quarter past. - Thank you. - Waiting for someone? - No. - Me neither. - But men wait for all women... They approach them and talk... usually, I don't respond. Today I forgot. My thoughts were elsewhere. You look so calm. - I'm on leave. - What's that outfit? I'm half in uniform, half gone, since I'm leaving tonight. That's it. I had three weeks and I didn't do anything. It was too short. I enjoy talking to you. - Are you married? - No. Do I look as if I'm out on the prowl? You seem to be waiting for something, not someone. - I'm waiting for a test result. - You're a student? No. A medical test. - Are you worried? - Very. What are you afraid of? Cancer, I think. I'll know tonight. - 50-50 chance it could be something else. - A fortune-teller saw it in the cards. - You believe in cards? - I'm afraid of everything. Birds, storms, lifts, needles and now, this huge fear of death. - You'd be scared all the time in Algeria with me. - How dreadful! Dying for nothing... that's what distresses me. Dying at war is sad. I'd rather die of love for a woman. Have you never been in love? Many times. Never how I wanted because of the girls. They love, and actually just want to be loved. They're afraid to give themselves, to lose something. They half-love. They save themselves. Their bodies are playthings. It's not their life. So I stop halfway too. - Sorry for saying all this. - No, you're right. Have you ever been in love? Like you said, I've always been afraid to give in. - What was the point? I was saving myself for... - Aren't we dramatising a bit? I'm really sad. It's all too much. Well, we're both in the same bubble. Better now? - You've got a pretty ring! - A pearl with a toad. You and me. - What time will you know? - The doctor's verifying it. I'll call tonight. Why not go to the hospital? I don't know what time to go, and I'm afraid to hear his answer. - Let's go together. Where is it? - Salpêtrière. It's near the Gare de Lyon. You can see me off after. - Shall we get a taxi? - The bus is more fun. CHAPTER 13 When my grandmother came to Paris, she had to see the building of her favourite magazine. It's nearby. Thanks to "Woman's World"... she knew everything. Where she lived there was no cinema, no bookshop, but she could talk about books and films like we do. I hate reading reviews. I don't like to know the story in advance. Like wishes before a birthday bring bad luck. - You're superstitious, then? - Oh, yes. I can wish you a happy summer. It's lucky, since today's the day. Maybe. It's Flora's day. Almost right! My name's Florence. They call me Cléo, short for Cleopatra. Quite a menu. Florence, it's Italy, the Renaissance, Botticelli, a rose, Cleopatra, it's Egypt, the Sphinx, the asp, a tigress... I prefer Florence. I prefer flora to fauna. - What a talker! - Bored? - No, I'm enjoying it. - The name "Cléo" sounds funny. - Like Cléo de Mérode... know her? - A singer of the 1900s. Less a singer than a courtesan! She was one of those who tempted our grandpas! - Back to your grandmother! - Yes. "Think of the future", she used to write. "Beware of loose women when you come home at night!" This area is nothing like that. I lived nearby as a student for seven years. I'm back here for the first time. I came with a friend, a model. - She poses nearby for a sculptor. - It's a peculiar job. - I understand. I'm not shy. - I am. Very. For me, nudity is indiscretion. It's night. It's illness. - How can you say that? - It's how I feel. There's our bus. Nudity should be for everyone, like summer. What does that mean? When one is naked, it's basic: love, birth, dawn. The sun, the beach, all that. Look... It looks like Snow White's coffin. My second one, they kept him two months like that... and all I could do was watch and wait. Once I saw one in the street. He looked fine, kicking his legs, though it was cold and snowing. I'm touched by nudity. Even an exciting striptease is moving. You're often touched, then. Not often. Nudity is rare. - We've exhausted that subject. - What next? Mocking me? I detest you. I'm getting off. But you're accompanying me. And you're accompanying me too. Have you forgotten? No, come here. You'll be on the platform, hanky in hand, like a soldier's bride... They'll think you're there for someone else... but I'll have a photo as proof. Time to pay. Two fares, please! I'll look at it during the journey. Can I have a photo? - Are you sure? - I'd like one. - Right now? - Yes. Later, we'll forget. I'll be so proud to have it. So that's why you accosted me? You're a photomaniac. You're a melomaniac. Not for music, but for melodrama! Insincere too! If I ask you for a photo, and admit that I'll boast about it, you should be pleased. Even great feelings are full of vanity, and great minds full of foolishness. Like great maxims you learn at school. I could never remember them. Depressing truths! - Do you know Paris? Have you been here long? - Every day I visit a new area. Today I'm visiting the 13th district... Place d'Italie, Florence! It's almost home for you. - Know the name of these trees? - No. They're Paulownias. Place d'Italie. End of zone! There are few Paulownias in Paris, and lots in China and Japan. It's a rare tree, from Poland. You're always teaching something. - I'm curious about many things. - You have answers for everything. It's strange, I have questions for everything. Today everything amazes me. People's faces next to mine. Where's the stop? At the St Marcel Metro. Thank you. La Pitié Hospital! This neighbourhood's full of hospitals, all side by side. As if people recover better around here! There's Broca, Cochin, Baudelocque, Le Val-de-Grâce... And the jail's name is "Health". - Your jokes are disarming. - I guess I'm armless. - I forget where it is. I came by taxi. - Let's ask. - The laboratory, please. - What's it regarding? I need to see Dr Valino. - He's not here. - He was two days ago. - Try his service. - Down on the right? No. Other side. I doubt he's still here. Is Dr Valino still there? - He's gone. - He said he'd be here. On the first day of summer, one can mistake the time of day. - Stop joking, I'm the sick one. - Don't get upset. It was a bad joke. I'm not joking. I'll find him. But if he's gone... Maybe he just stepped out. He said he'd be here. It's maddening. I've waited two days for this. It's been three weeks. They should know we're expecting them. And my daughter, couldn't she have thought of me? - It's the same for me. - She could've brought a bouquet. Doesn't look like a hospital. It's like an old château, with gardens for giving parties. Your hand, Florence. Like that cedar of Lebanon? Doesn't dusk give you Wanderlust? - When's your train? - About eight. The boat's tomorrow. So little time left. It's silly to look for the doctor. There's no hurry, I'll call tonight. Yes, I'd like to know Lebanon and the Paulownias. Give me your address now, or we'll forget. Thanks, Florence. Thanks, Cléo. It's a lovely garden. It smells sweet. It's well looked-after. Shall we stay a bit, or go? I'm a little tired. Want to eat at a restaurant terrace or elsewhere? As you please. We have plenty of time. I was wrong about Flora. Summer's goddess is Ceres. - And me? - Flora's the goddess of spring. - Spring ended yesterday. - Today's Flora's summer. - Why didn't you come to my office? - They told me you'd gone and I couldn't go in. I'm her brother. I'm leaving tonight. I wanted to see you. - Naturally, I'm worried. - Don't worry too much. We'll take great care of your sister. Two months of radiation should put things right. She'll let you know. If not, write to me. Come at 11 tomorrow and we'll set up the treatment. Why? I'm sorry I'm leaving. I'd like to be with you. You are. I've the feeling my fear has gone. I've the feeling I'm happy.
