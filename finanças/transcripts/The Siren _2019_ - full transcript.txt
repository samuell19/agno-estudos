[thunder cracks] [Al V/O] Dear Michael, I read a story the other night that I thought you might like. The Legend of The Rusalka. [water lapping] The rusalka begins life as an ordinary young woman. But then one day, while love sick, she drowns in a body of water. She wakes up transformed. A living ghost. A siren. Trapped in the lake in which she died and she is forever cursed with an unholy want to drown anyone who comes near her again. [water bubbling] I know you are just meat and dirt now, somewhere in the lake. And I know that the story is just a legend, but every day I hunt. And I swear to you, my love, that I will find the thing that killed you. And even if I lose my life or my soul, I will kill it. And I will watch it die. And then... maybe, one day I will see you again. ["Tkho Nad Richkoyu" by Kitka] ♪♪ [women vocalizing] [trees rustling] [on phone] I'm not sure how we're going to manage without you.
