What are you doing? I'm trying it out. You're crazy! THE GIANTS Look what we found in the house. - Grandpa's gun. - Fuck! - With bullets. - Don't play with it, Zak. - I'm not playing. - Put it away. - I'm just looking. - Fucking put it away! Want to go in there? It's OK, I know it. It's OK, I know it! It's Beef's place. We put in 10 each. Thanks. Right, I'm going. - You'll wait for me? - Yes. Got much left? 2.50. And two 20 notes as well. And at home? Cut it out, Zak. - Are you a faggot? - No. Are you sure? Sure you're not a faggot? No, I'm not. Are you sure? You faggot. I knew it. My kid brother's a faggot. You're the faggot. What are you doing with those little shits? What are you doing with them? OK, let's go. - Is that Beef? - No, that's not him. - He's not Beef? - No, that's Angel. - Why did he hit you? - Fucking drive, OK? - Got it? - Yeah. Shit. I've dropped my roach! Is rowing tough? Anyone can row. You know how? Who drives Grandpa's car? Doesn't mean you can row. Who taught you to drive? I did. How old are you? 15. And you? 15. And you? Seventeen. Just kidding. 15. You're not 14. Thirteen and three-quarters. That's not 15. Someone's coming, guys! Shit! Isn't that the guy who hit you? - What does he want? - I have to go. - Don't go. - I have to. Why? He's my brother. Shit. They're coming after us! Mum, where are you? No, I'm fine. Seth's here with me. He's fine, too. Where are you? When are you coming for us? OK. Why? Yes. When? No. Not at all. Hello? Hello? Mum? Well? She can't come back yet. She'll come and fetch us later. - She doesn't give a damn about us. - Stop it. She doesn't love us, Zak. Stop it. Can we go? - Angel did that to you? - Yeah. Does it hurt? No. What's up with you two? I'm used to it. Is this the problem? No. What then? - We're broke. - Flat broke? We searched the house and found nothing. Not a penny. - I can bring you stuff to eat. - No, it's OK. We pinch stuff from the neighbour's cellar. All we can do is hang around here all day long. It rubbish. We can't even buy any weed. And this? It's for the car. Great, so let's go out for a ride. The car runs on petrol. That could be heating oil. There's nothing marked on it. Put some in the mower. If it conks out, that means it's heating oil. He keeps watching us. What a pain in the arse! Are we gonna wait much longer? - How much longer? - It has to burn off the petrol. But if we've put petrol in, it won't stop! - Right! - We could wait for ages. Let's go, Zak. This is a good one. I need to pee. So piss in the river. He really is pissing. Shit, I splashed my trousers. Row faster. Shit! - Make him piss on himself. - I'm soaked. I pissed on the boat, too. - You jerk, Zak. We sit there. - Not my fault. - For God's sake. - Is it my fault? Prick! - Just be more careful. - I'll clean it up. - What with? - I pissed on myself, damn it! Look. - Fucking hell! - You idiot. - Don't move. - We have to find it. Got it. We can't kill a duck. We're not killing a duck, we're trying a gun. Give it here. - Killing a duck sucks. - We're just shooting at one. - We need a target. - Use a tree. Trees don't move. I won't kill it. I'll just shoot at it. - What if you hit it? - I won't. - What if you do? - I won't. But what if you do? Missed again. My turn. Fuck! - Go a bit closer. - Go ahead. They're not real bullets! Fucker. Want this in your face? - See this blaze? - You're good. I'll teach you one day. Why does your brother hit you? Because he's an arsehole. And your parents say nothing? They're too old. I couldn't care less anyway. I'm gonna leave. - You're going away? - Yeah, for good. Where'll you go? Don't know. South, to Spain. Life's easy there. It's easy to get papers. It's easy to get work. You party, you pick fruit. You have cash to see the year out. The girls are beautiful, it's sunny all the time. You smoke good dope. No one pisses you off. I just need to get some cash. How about you? - What? - Will your mum be back soon? I doubt it. What'll you do? Don't know. You'll get money easily with the house. Beef rents places for three months. Just long enough to harvest his weed. Then he leaves. Just three months? Yeah. I heard Angel say so. - Does he pay well? - Yeah, I think so. - Why's he called Beef? - He worked in a slaughterhouse. He used to kill bulls. One blow, between the eyes. So why isn't he called "Bull"? Bull and Beef is the same thing. He did it to a guy once. He stared right at him and hit him between the eyes. The guy was dead before he hit the floor. - He killed him? - You bet. If he stares at you and doesn't speak, that's bad. They knew he was dead before he hit the floor? - People saw. - But how could they tell? - You can tell when someone's dead. - How? It's when your eyes turn white and roll all the way back. - I can roll my eyes back. - All the way? - Yeah. - Go on. You can't. - I can. - You're squinting. - I'm not. - I'll show you. See, you can do it, and you're not dead. You said you had to be dead. If we see Beef, will you come, too? - You'd rent the house out? - Got a better plan? Coming with us? Yeah. We can all gang up on Angel. You bet. We'll kick Angel's arse. He's a piece of shit. What a fucking fuckwad. I'll tell him, "Come on then, Angel." I'll waste the motherfucker. You hit my pal, fucker? Motherfucker! Piece of shit! Screw you! Fucking fuckwad! - Shithead! - Fucking fuckwad! Fucking fuckwad! Fucker! Fuck your mother! - She's your mum, too, dickhead! - Bothered. Motherfucker! Fucking dickhead! Will Beef be here soon? Have some more Coke. - Thanks. - Want some? No thanks. Just a drop then. Thanks. Stop it! You're crazy. He's got so much. Forget about it. It's our grandfather's house. He died last year and the house is empty. It's free. Free to grow weed there. It belongs to me and my brother. What about your parents? My parents work abroad. They never come back. Hardly ever. We don't stay here because we have school. We don't live here. We have a big house in Brussels. We only come here in the summer. My brother and me. The house is free, except in summer when we're here. What do your parents do? - They work in an embassy. - Which country? - Spain. - Yeah, Spain. How many rooms? Loads. It's a big house. Is the power on? Yeah. I'll need to see it. Think it'll work? I think so. Seen this? - He gave it to you? - Yeah. It's a good sign. - Are you worried? - No. It'll be OK. - Little faggot! - I'm not worried. - Sure? - I'm sure. Go for it. Holy shit. Dany! Where the hell were you? I was texting Mum. - That stuff's hot. - I know. - It's better. - Why? When you eat spicy food, your arse stings. When you shit after spicy food, your arse stings. So? When your arse stings, have a wank. It's more powerful, like shagging a girl. It's true. The pain makes it better. So wank with a knife in your arm! No, you dick. The pain's inside your arse and your arse is just next to your balls. Try it. You'll see. Give me that. - Give it here! - Just a second. Give me some. You can't eat that. Wanna bet? It burns! Cut it out! Are you nuts or what? Zak! Shut up! Think the neighbour saw us? There's a cellar? Yes. Just there. It's a bit far for me. And it's not that big. We're interested if you empty the place out. Completely. Completely. Completely. How'll you manage that? I know a second-hand dealer who'd give you a fair price for the lot. OK? All right. We'll need to change the locks, and you can't come back until we harvest. Six months from now. - Not three months? - Six months. We have to leave for six months? For the rent, we checked on the Net. The going rate around here is 850 a month. That's all? There's a recession going on. As a workshop, the rent has to be lower. It's a long way, too. The neighbours won't like a dog so I'll need someone to guard it. All extra costs. We can give you 400 a month. All right. Whose car is it? It was Grandpa's. I'll take it, too. Good. It's not bad. Sure they're not here? It's their holiday home, but they never come. - How do we get in? - Around the back. Shit! It's cool here. Come on. What if they turn up and find us here? They won't come now. The summer's over. Not even on weekends. We could stay six months? If you don't screw up. It's packed! Italian, Flemish... It's good. Try this. - It's good. - You're nuts! - It's disgusting. - Look, guys. Go easy, guys. Shit, it's strong. What are you doing? Shit, it's stuck. My balls! - Know what that is? - You bet. - So what is it? - The pill. - What's it for? - It's to avoid having babies. - No, it's for women's periods. - Bullshit! You take the pill to sleep with your boyfriend. With my boyfriend? He's wasted. Shit, my eyes! Fucking wake up, guys. There are people here. They're here. Zak, fucking wake up! Move it! Does it smell nice? Yes. Very nice. Here. Thank you, madame. What? Get lost! Get lost! It's not a lot. He says Beef will pay the rest. Yeah? It's strange. There's nothing left. We had no choice without her here. I know, I'm just saying it's strange with nothing here. Had your hair dyed? It's cute. You look like the three little pigs. Why are you here? This is our place. No. Not any more. It's Beef's place and I work for Beef. Don't fucking come here. You've got five minutes to grab your stuff and get out. If I see you anywhere near here, even once... I'll batter you. You... you and you. Especially you. What? Get out of here! Cut it out. Cut it out! I've got stuff for you. Blankets, boots, pans, a blade... - milk... - A what? A blade. A knife. I've got my sleeping bag. I'll come to the hut, too. Shall we go? It's OK. It's not too bad. We're sinking, guys! We're sinking! We're not sinking! Fucking help me, will you? The damn thing's slipping, OK? You're a pain in the arse, Zak! Cut it out! Shit. I'm fucking soaked. What do we do now? - Where are you going? - I want my blanket. Shit, it's soaked. Pain in the arse. Here. Are you crazy? - You missed it. - See how you threw it? I threw it fine. - Cut it out. - What? - Catch this one. - What's wrong with you? For fuck's sake, guys! Stop sulking. It's a pain. I'm not sulking. - Jesus, Zak. - You're gross. What now? Hello. Is Beef here? No. We're here about the rent. We're out of cash. Beef hasn't paid us yet. Beef handles all that. - When will he be back? - I don't know. - Today? - Not today, no. - When? - Don't come back today. - When? - I don't know, but not today. - Say we came. - Come back tomorrow. Yes, OK. But can you tell him we came? Yes. Goodbye. Seth. Seth! That's bullshit. He's here. Why did she keep saying not to come back today? He's here. He doesn't want to pay us. They're taking us for a ride. What are you doing? What are you doing? Where are you going? Are you fucking stupid? Cut it out! Fucking stop! Piss off! Cut it out! Move! Fucking move! Well? She said I was OK. - Does it still hurt? - No, I'm OK. - You? - I'm OK. We're in the shit now. Yeah. You gave that fucker a real beating. I said I'd kick his arse. If he finds me, he'll kill me. - So let's stay here. - We can't. If we stay, she'll have problems. Her, too. So what do we do?
