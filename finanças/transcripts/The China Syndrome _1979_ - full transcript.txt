Playback, please. Five, four, three, two, one. - Go. - Camera two, we need to clear bars. This is only 40 seconds long. Let's hustle up. There we go. Camera two is clear. - Okay, let's preview. - Red hair was a good idea. - We talked about cutting it. - What did she say? We haven't talked to her, but she'll do what we tell her. - Good. - Not much. That's it. - Okay. - Guys, what are we doing? Studio B, this is remote. We're gonna come out of the last section tight. Tell Pete to say good-bye. Studio B, this is Kimberly. How soon do we go live? Make sure Pete knows. Just time to say good-bye. Thank you. Fellas, anybody listening to me? - Coming to camera two. - Is Mac there? - Three seconds. - Mac, here. What is it? How soon are you gonna hit us? We're gonna need at least five minutes before we go on. Can you put us after the commercial? Not a chance. This is last section. - Can you give us two? - Coming to you in 40 seconds. You can't do that. We don't have a cameraman. - Where the hell is George? - He's taking a leak. What do you want me to tell you? He locked the camera down before he left. This is a 2 1 /2 minute spot. It's not gonna hold in a static shot. Better tell Pete to stretch because remote's gonna be late. Stretch Pete. Slow him down. Make sure he knows. I was thinking maybe you could start on a tight shot of me. Then after I introduce them, pull back to a wide. No problem. Just get George back. Camera two is clear. Here we come. Got less than a minute. We're about to go on the air. Clear back there. Thanks. - Y'all ready? Everybody ready? - Fifteen seconds. Right now barometric pressure is at 30.07 and steady... with the relative humidity 4 1 %. The wind is from the south-southwest at five miles an hour. Now it's time to switch controls to Kimberly Wells... who is out in the field with a live Minicam report. Pete. What did you do the last time someone had a birthday? Send a card or maybe flowers? Kinda boring, huh? Wanna try something more imaginative? Give an ''H, ''give an ''H'' give an H-A-P. Give a ''P, ''give a ''P'' give a P-P-Y. Give a ''B, ''give an ''I, ''give an R-T-H Happy birthday. Give a cheer, give a big hooray There's something that I've come to say. And this is just one part of a new group... that seems to be taking L.A. by storm. Live Wires-- the singing telegram people. And there's one for every occasion. The Gederschkins and Matatowskis all have sent us here to tell you. That they love you, surely We've come to wish you gladness. Madness, madness We've come to wish you joy. Happy anniversary This is your golden year. Maybe your parents are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary... and you'd like to send them an opera-gram. Or maybe you have a message that words cannot express. That's the kind of stuff I wanna see. Get in tight on the navel. Oh, mercy.! Stand by. Coming to two. That is a belly-gram... and words cannot express that. That's the kind of stuff I wanna see. Ratings have gone up half a point since we put her on the show. Our research said she'd do well in the L.A. market. Hey, very good.! Very nice show, Kimberly. Mac here. Can you hear me? - Change of schedule. - You gotta be kidding. Again? - We're goin' to Ventana. - That's great.! Be there at 1 :30. What about the crew, Richard and Hector? They'll pick you up and you can all drive up together. Right. Okay. Can I have a hit? Thanks. I don't smoke. It's 1 2:40 in Los Angeles. Temperature is 68 degrees at the Civic Center. Here's a new one on the charts for the first time this week. They're here, Mr. Gibson. Hi. Bill Gibson, Public Relations. Here to help you through security. Exterior. Ventana special. Take one. We're rolling. Anytime. This is Kimberly Wells. I'm here at the Ventana Nuclear Power Plant... owned and operated by California Gas and Electric. The huge dome that you see behind me... is called the containment and houses the nuclear fuel. In this section of ''Energy in California''... we're going to focus on nuclear power-- that almost magical transformation of matter into energy... that the experts tell us may be our best shot... at energy selfish suff-- suffi-- - Cut! - Shit. - What happened? - You said ''selfish sufficiency''... instead of''self-sufficiency.'' Self-sufficiency. Right from the top. Let's keep going. This is a pellet of simulated uranium... the exact size that's used in the fuel rods. This tiny pellet contains more energy... than six carloads of coal. We have 20 million of those pellets inside the reactor vessel. That's here. We call it the ''core.'' Around the core, of course, is water. Water is used as a coolant. Inside the fuel assembly is another set of rods... called the ''control rods.'' These rods actually control the nuclear reaction. What happens is this: When the core is put on-line-- when it's activated-- the control rods are lifted out. With them gone, nuclear fuel sets up a chain reaction... that produces a tremendous amount of heat that boils the water... that turns to steam that turns the turbine... that turns the generator that produces electricity. That's it. That's a cut. That was great. Let's get a reaction shot on Kimberly over here. - You don't need to do it again? - No, it was great. - You made it seem simple. - It really is. If you don't need me for a couple of seconds, I'd like to get your hard hats. - You want me to get this light? - You gonna take us inside the plant? - That's the next stop. - Great. - You all set, Kimbo? - Yeah-- Oh, my God. -Lookin' good. -That's what I get for staying out late. - Get rid of my circles, will you? - I'll try my best. We try harder. You're a pal. Don't touch my hair. React on William Gibson. He's right here. - Did you get the pellet? - Yeah, nice close insert. - That's not cheating too much? - No, highly complimentary angle. You're gonna love it. Gibson's talking. You're listening. Interested, very interested. The steam turns the turbine, turns the generator. Then the shit hits the fan. Come on, Kimbo. Hold it together. Very good. Uranium, huh? They make bombs out of that stuff, don't they? They didn't mention that, did they? Wait till you get to the other room, get that radiation all over that body. Take one of those black pellets and you'll really turn on. - Ready? - That's a cut. You've got our hats? Your hat. One size fits all. - Let me have that. - Great. Can we film in the containment area? No, not while we're on-line. - Is it all right if I leave my jacket? - That'll be fine. -Just follow me. - Man does his job, doesn't he? Listen, you. Don't blow it for me, Richard. This is coverage, not controversy. - Will you be a friend? - I'm trying. This is the turbine room. Rolling! Ventana power plant. Kimberly Wells. Take one. This is a rare opportunity to see inside a nuclear power plant. Standing here next to this giant turbine... you can actually feel the power. And power is what it's all about. This 800-megawatt plant generates enough electricity... to meet the needs of a city of three-quarters of a million people. We're now 50 feet above the floor of the turbine room... on an incredible moving crane. Mr. Gibson, what is this crane used for? We use it to transport very, very heavy pieces of machinery... up to hundreds of tons. I think it'll support us all right. I certainly hope so. How many people are employed here? At present time, we have a payroll of 1 50. How do they work in all this noise? Noise? What noise? I don't hear any noise. What? This level here is 80 feet from where we were. - Is there enough light for you? - No way. - Sound's no good. - Meet our plant supervisor. Herman DeYoung, this is Kimberly Wells. Yes, I recognize you. How are you? If I can do anything for you, just let me know. Thank you, Herman. It's too dark here. We can't film anything. Okay. I got a better idea anyway. All right. I think you'll like this. That the way to the containment? Yes. Oh, God, my ears. - How old is this plant? - We went on-line four years ago. Took over 1 2 years to build. Don't you have another plant opening pretty soon? We'll be licensing Point Conception hopefully in the next couple of weeks. The safety hearings are going on right now. Together the two plants will generate more electricity... than the Hoover Dam and the Grand Coulee combined. That's very interesting. Your tongue is black. I think you're contaminated. This is the control room. Brains of the beast, huh? The glass is bulletproof and soundproof. God, they're all so young. - It's a young industry. - I see an older guy. Make you feel better? No, he just looks like the only guy old enough to know what he's doing. That's Ted Spindler. He's been with the company since before the plant was built. I'm sorry. We can't film in that direction for obvious security reasons. - Not one shot? - No. How 'bout a cold drink? No, thank you. I'll take one. You people always work together? - Yeah. - No. We're just doing this energy special together. I used to make commercials with these bums. Kimberly's employed full-time by the station... but old Hector and I, we're just independent. Very independent. - What was that? - Felt like an earthquake. What the hell is-- What have we got, turbine trip? Yeah. ''Generator trip. Full load. Rejection. Turbine trip.'' ''Reactor scram.'' Okay, we're off the line. Disconnected from the grid. Ted, stabilize the reac-- Right. Radiation in the containment! - What level? - Level 8. Okay. Borden, relax. Must be that safety valve just opened after the trip. Holt, cut down the recirc pumps. Barney, come over here and keep your eye on the feedwater. Holler out those numbers if they don't start to drop. Line up the valves and put the turbine on a turning gear. Somebody turn off the goddamned alarm. Thank you. I don't know how they figure... you're supposed to be able to give orders with a racket like that. - Are you within limits, Ted? - Yeah, it's gonna level out okay. - Systems status. - Reactor pressure back to normal. Right. Jack, phone for you. - We still have high radiation-- - Perfectly normal. Feedwater's low-- 450,000 pounds per hour, and it's decreasing. - Godell here. - Bill Gibson in the visitor's gallery. I got some people here from Channel 3. They're shootin' a TVnews special at the plant. Listen, what the hell's goin'on down there? It's just a routine turbine trip, Bill. Just take it easy. High water level in the reactor! We're still on main auxiliary power. Okay, relax! Everybody, relax. Got high water in the core, and I'm gonna dump it. There's nothing to worry about. It's just a routine turbine trip. See if you can find out where that goddamn water's coming from. Wherever it's coming from, we gotta get rid of it. Look at this. - Uh-oh. - Hey, Barney. - Open 1 4 and 1 5. - You can't do that. - Open 'em! - The book says you can't. Screw the book. We're almost up to the steam lines. Those flashing lights are called annunciators. When they're activated, it means something in the plant needs attention. There's obviously a lot of activity, but Godell says it's routine. - Are you filming? - He's a good man, Godell. He was a commander of a submarine in the nuclear navy. We have these turbine trips a couple of times a year. - What's a turbine trip? - The turbine is no longer turning... because the steam's been shut down. It just might be a feedwater leak. - Which valve? - Can't really tell. - Shut the isolation valves. - You're gonna need that water later. You wanna go down there and do it by hand? Do it! Close the isolation valves! Go back to your stations. We'll try to handle the goddamn feedwater. - Hey,Jack! - What? Look at this water level indicator. Water level's low. This says it's high. Well, that's-- that's-- Jesus Christ! Barney, give me feedwater! Goddamn it! We may have uncovered the core. - Operations. - We have a serious condition. Get everybody into safety areas, and make sure that they stay there. All personnel proceed directly to safety areas. All personnel proceed directly to safety areas. Caution: Code six. This is not a drill. We stay right here. This is a safety area. Jesus! Hurry up! Come on, you guys! Move it! Routine, huh? - Talk to me. - I can't give you very much. We're isolated and on auxiliary feedwater. Besides, I've only got one system that's operational. - Less than nine inches. - Is it holding? It's dropping. We're losing it. My God, we're losing it. What the hell happened to the high pressure coolant injection? LPCI's valved out for maintenance. I don't believe it. We gotta dump pressure. We can't take that chance! Let me know the split second the L.P.C.I. comes in. Right. Water. Eight inches. Still droppin'. Oh, please, God, cover it. Cover it! We've got LPCI! Comin' up. It's comin' up. All right! We got it! Don't bother with the interviews.Just the stuff we did in the control room. Just the magazine on the accident. - Did you shoot normal? - Straight normal A.S.A., 230 feet. Shouldn't take more than 40 minutes. Hey, Mort, we got a rush. It's for me for the 6:00. The film in the machine has to run through, then I have these two. Mort, it's hot. Do it. - You gonna wait? - Yeah. Go get 'em! - What is it? - Dynamite, Morty. Nuclear dynamite. I'll bet. - We need more of that. - You're right. About time you got back. You better get into makeup. George has written the marathon piece. He'll have a shot sheet by the time you get back. How'd it go? Dump the marathon. I got the lead story. Fine. You'll be on eight minutes in, right after the first commercial. Did you hear me? I got the lead story. It's in the lab. I'm gonna write the script before it's out of the soup. - What is it? - An accident at Ventana. Richard's got it all on film. Why didn't you call in? We didn't want to risk talking on the mobile phone. You never know who might be listening. Mac, the crew's reached the scene on the hostage story. Frank, check that out, will you? - You want a beeper for the 6:00? - Call me in the control-- No, we'll plan on it. What have you got? There's nothing on the wire about an accident at Ventana. I know. We were looking at the control room, and there was an accident. I don't know what it was, but it's clear the guys inside were scared to death. Richard's got it all on film without them knowing it. I better callJacovich. This is the script that goes with it. Hello? Yeah. Mr.Jacovich. - It's for you. - Thank you. Hello. Yeah. Who? - Okay, I'll be right there. - I cut off the whole front part. - Do they know this film exists? - No. - I wish we had the sound. - Clean it up, get it to telecine. - I'm not putting it on the 6:00. - Why? - Not till I find out what's going on. - But it's an exclusive. This is the first decent hard news story we've had in months. It looks like a great story, but we don't know exactly what it is. It's totally irresponsible to go on the air without checking the facts. The fact is that it happened. We were there-- - Make sure that film gets in the vault. - Right. Move it, you guys. You've got a newscast. Kimberly, you better hurry. You're gonna be late. - I'll talk to you. - Yeah, please do. We're gonna open on one. Then camera two, R.P. Places, everyone! - Hurry up, Kimberly. - Bernie, you wanna give me a spritz? -Just a little bit of powder. - Slide the key to the left. Commercial ends in 1 0 seconds. Stand by, TelePrompTer. Stand by, studio. Hurry up, Kimberly. Ten seconds. There she is. About time, lovely. Five, four, three, two. This is Channel 3 Update... Southern California's most complete television newscast... gathered and prepared by Los Angeles' most professional news men and women. With award-winning anchorman Pete Martin... Henry Leeds, weather, Leon Klaster, sports... and Kimberly Wells with ''California Close-up. '' And now, Pete Martin. Good evening. In the headlines tonight, six people have been killed... in the crash of a light plane near Lake Tahoe. A compromise seems near in the Social Security funding bill. And a Los Angeles group has petitioned the Food and Drug Administration... to outlaw all food additives. If the license on Point Conception is delayed even slightly... our cash flow dries up. We've got debts on the power grid to every utility west of the Rockies. I figure we'll be losing... $492,000 a day. After that, Herman... anything you say should be good news, shouldn't it? Sir, there's no damage. We have a little cleaning up to do. - There will have to be a hearing. - Formal? Yes, the N.R.C. is sending an investigating team. We'll be testifying ourselves starting tomorrow. Will you be back on-line by the end of the week? We should be, if we don't run into any snags. I want you to keep that investigation on track. Now you be thorough. Make sure everything's all right... but let's not waste any unnecessary time. - Let's get it over with. - Yes, sir. And for God's sake... we've had our surprise for the year. Yes, sir. Hello? It's Gibson. Hi, Bill. Yeah. What kind of film? They were where? - Good morning. - Hi, David. How are you? Hi,Jim. Come in. What are you talkin' about? You gotta put it on the air. I photographed an accident. An accident in nuclear power plant. I don't know that ''accident'' is the right word. Accident is the right word! - Nice of you to make it. - Sorry I'm late. This station's got a yellow streak that wide down its back. - Obviously, you've made a decision. - Don't start. I'm not. I was just making an observation. Let me read something to you, Richard. ''Nuclear plants are considered security installations... and as such, fall under the protection ofTitle 1 8... of the United States Criminal Code. Unauthorized photography--'' And I'm quoting. ''Unauthorized photography is a felony.'' In the strictest technical sense, we could all be considered accessories... just for having that film on the premises. It's all bullshit! Don't kick me under the table. I'm not gonna shut up! Have you seen what they officially released? ''An unanticipated transient''? What the hell is that? It was an accident, and we could have been killed! Don't you think that's stretching it a little bit? ''Stretching it''? Thank you. According to CG&E, you were in no real danger at any time. Don, I know what you're saying... but if you'd been there, it'd be hard to believe there wasn't any danger. Maybe we should show it to an expert and get an objective opinion. The film stays in the vault. This is all a goddamned cover-up. Kimberly says she sees you talking to their P.R. guy, Gibson. That's right. I told him that we've got the film and it stays in the vault. So, it's a conspiracy? It is not a conspiracy. It is not a cover-up. The plant had no obligation to contact the press. And they wouldn't have if we had not been there! They did exactly what they are required by law to do. They shut down the plant. They contacted the N.R.C. They are conducting an investigation. I'll bet. It's gonna be a hell of a fast one with another plant trying to get a license! Please calm down. Who is conducting the investigation? The Nuclear Regulatory Commission. We will be given a full report. At that time, and only at that time, we will decide what to do about the film! I don't believe this. I really don't believe this. I just-- So you're gonna sit here? This is none of her business. She doesn't make policy. She is a performer. But she is a professional. Aren't you? She understands the problems connected with something this sensitive. We are not gonna open ourselves up to a massive lawsuit. - You're being pressured. - We're not. - Yes, you're being pressured. - You're being hysterical. And you're bein' a chickenshit asshole. I'm gonna talk to him. What did you do that for? They got you, didn't they? A piece of talking furniture. Never thought I'd see it-- All we could hope for is they'd go for the scoop. I thought they would, you thought they would, and they didn't. They're right. Legally, they'd be sued. Yeah. I am not ashamed that I've got a good job... and I have every intention of keeping it and getting a better one. That's right. ''Good.'' If that means they've got me, then they've got me. If I remember right, you called me and said you wanted to work on the inside. - And could I throw you a bone? - Thank you for the bone. Anytime. - I want to talk to him. - Later. Talk to him tonight. The Minicam van is waiting to take you... to wherever you're going for your Live At Noon spot. I'm going to the zoo. There's a tiger having a birthday party. 'A faulty relay in the generator circuit... tripped the generator breakers open. The resultant transient in water level and pressure... caused the turbine to trip and for safety relief valve number eight... to open automatically. This, of course, suddenly shut down the reactor.'' A scram situation. So except for the course of the second shock wave-- Uh, excuse me. Uh, it's not really... a shock wave, it's-- It was more of a shudder. A heavy vibration. Right here. So except for this shudder, you're clear in your mind up to this point? Yes, sir. Now, the reactor water level begins to drop. Yes, but that's because we thought the water level was high. It turns out that the pen... in the water level recorder was stuck. So you began cutting off the feedwater flow and releasing steam... in the belief that the water was too high. Yes, sir. But, in fact, the water level was becoming dangerously low. Yes. Why didn't your operator look at the other indicators? I don't know. I was beside him. I didn't look at it either. - How'd it go? - Okay. What'd you tell 'em? I'm not allowed to discuss the testimony. I'll see you later. Yeah, I'm right here. Can I interest you in one of these? - Please eat! - In your ear, Pete. - Did you hear how much she's getting? - What? 250 thou. You gotta be kidding. Did you know that she's getting-- She started out doing the weather. I like the idea of her hair being shorter. We'll be sitting over there. - Puerto what? - Puerto Vallarta. - How can you afford it? - American plan. $369. Excuse me. May I? Excuse me. Gonna have a drink, I think. - Enjoying yourself? - It's a good party. I saw your zoo piece on Live At Noon. It was brilliant. We got a lot of calls about that. You did? That's good. How are you doing on the energy specials? Any more shooting on that? We've finished shooting. We just have the beginning and ending to do... and we're editing. I think you're gonna be pleased. I want to apologize for Richard this morning. He's difficult sometimes... but he's the best cameraman I've ever worked with. You haven't worked with that many, have you? As a matter of fact, I've worked with quite a few. I thought he was on staff until I called down this afternoon to fire him. I don't like him. When they offered me the specials, there were no staff crew available. That's why I asked for Richard. I think he's good. - He's won a lot of awards. - I'm sure. Hothead award, foul mouth award, can of worms award. I know. I think it was wrong that he said what he said. I agree with you. What are you gonna do with the film? The legal hassles have just begun. Not to worry your pretty head about. - Let us take care of that. - Coffee? - No, thanks. - No, thank you. You just keep doing a good job. You're doing one hell of a good job. Our ratings, and the research confirms this... have gone up because of you. So, Don, let me do some hard news. I wanna do some real reporting. I feel you're better off doing the softer stuff. You didn't get this job because of your investigative abilities. Don't fight it. Don't try to be anything else. I love you doing exactly what you do best. But I'd be good doing news. Okay. We'll see. Let's take a look at the specials. We'll see. Yeah. I like your hair like that. Don't stay too late. You lonely old coot. You wanna come inside with me a minute? How ya been? There. Just come in and have a little chat with me. Us two girls sittin' around by the fire. What am I gonna give you today? How about some yucky old lettuce? Let's see here. Just you and me, kid. You wanna take a little bath? Hi, darling. It's your mother. You know how I hate talking into these machines. Call me when you can. Bye-bye. Corinne here. Wanted you to take me to theJacovich party... but I'll call David. See you there. Bye. How about those ratings? Hi, it's Buck Brewer. You remember me? Pilot, American Airlines. We met in New York. I'm gonna be here a couple of days, and I would love to get together. I saw you on the news tonight. You were great. Call me if you get in before 1 1:00. I'm at the Beverly Hillcrest. Ciao. Oh, shit. It's your mother again. Don't forget your father's birthday is next week. Says he doesn't want any presents, but you know him. Call me after he goes to work tomorrow. This is Richard. You really are an asshole. Oh, God. - Yeah. - Can I see you a sec? I want to get your impressions of one phase of the transient. Yeah, right there. About 1 5 seconds after the turbine trip, did you feel a secondary vibration? - The main steam line closure. - No, that's right at the start. I felt that too. I'm talking about later. More of a vibration than a shock. Right here. It's relief valve 1 4. No, I don't think so, 'cause that was late-- Didn't they ask you anything about this? They asked us not to discuss the hearing procedures. That's during the investigation. Is this part of the investigation? What's the matter? They had me in there seven hours, twice as long as anybody else. You and these hotshot navy guys, you got credentials. I'm a 25-year company man. I didn't know nothin' about nuclear till they built this plant. You tell me: Where do you think the ax of human error is gonna fall? What makes you think they're looking for a scapegoat? Tradition. I'm gonna get a cup of coffee. Yeah. One of the basic principles of physics... is that what goes up must come down. And that's exactly what happened today in Cudahy. Hot air balloons are lighter than air and that's why they fly. But they aren't always lighter than gravity. And that's why sometimes they don't fly. Amateur balloonist William Levin was flying near Cudahy this morning... when his balloon apparently decided it was time to come down. It could have landed in a treetop, but it didn't. On a flat rooftop, but it wouldn't. Or on top of a camper where it shouldn't, but it did. There were no injuries, unless you include one slightly wounded pride. The police didn't hold a grudge, though. They helped him pick up the pieces and even gave him a ride home. - Pete? - That your filled-with-hot-air report? You should know. You're the expert. I don't know about that. I think I've been the victim of the perfect squelch. That's the News At Noon. Thanks for watching. We'll be back at 6:00. Right now, for all of us here at Channel 3 News, I'm Pete Martin. Have a good day, everybody. I can't believe what you said right on the air. Are you trying to destroy my credibility? You'll recover. Leave the cameras in position. Next item on the schedule-- - Have you seen Richard? - Not since yesterday morning. I'm probably gonna see him this afternoon to work on the special. - Why? - The son of a bitch stole the film. - What? - I just came from the vault. You brought him in on this, so it is your neck. Jacovich is in San Francisco until tomorrow afternoon. I want that film on my desk before he gets back! Okay, Mac. Thanks. - Let me read that. - Wait a second. Where'd you get it? - In the front office. - Ted, what's goin'on? It's a preliminary report. It just came down. God, that was fast. Listen to this. ''Operating personnel responded swiftly... and professionally, etcetera, etcetera. While some operator error was evident... and procedures violated to some degree... the result was a swift containment of a potentially costly event.'' I heard up front we're goin' back on-line tomorrow. In this section of ''Energy in California'... we're going to take a look at the power of the sun-- what it will do for our economy and our environment. Mr. Thurston, according to a recent study... by the California Public Policy Center-- - Where's Richard? - He's not here. - Where is he? - I don't know. He asked me to come in and work on the energy special, then he left. Do you know that he stole the film from the station? He's gonna get us into a lot of trouble. - Where is he? - I don't know where he is. You are one of the more observant people that I know. I don't believe you saw him... and he didn't give you any idea where he was going. He came in and took the projector and the film. My guess is he went back to the power plant... to try and get somebody to explain this stuff. And he calls me an asshole. If you see him, tell him to let me know what's going on. You're a real mensch. We were lucky as hell. This could have dragged on for months. Hey, hon, you new in town? - Isn't that that girl on Channel 3? - It sure is. Are you looking for somebody? - I'm looking for a friend. - Would you like to join us? Your friend's gonna get here sooner or later because everybody does. It's the only decent watering hole in the area. That's what they told me at the visitor's center. - Come on. Have a drink. - Yeah, I could use a drink. Good. Harry! - Somebody who works at the plant? - No. - What would you like? - Scotch on the rocks. - Double. - You got it. Saw you tonight on the 6:00. Terrific, huh? - You work at that plant. - I'm sorry.Jack Godell. This is Alma and Ted Spindler. How do you do? Nice to meet you. What's all the celebrating? The plant got a clean bill of health this afternoon. - The investigation's over? - Why are you so surprised? Because I was there when the accident happened. I saw you there. There wasn't any accident. What was it? A faulty relay in the generator circuit. - A faulty what? - Relay in the generator circuit. - Well, you wouldn't understand. - And that's all? A stuck valve. - On the house! - Thank you. You guys certainly seemed relieved when it was over for a stuck valve. There wasn't any accident. When are you starting up again? The plant? Tomorrow. Something like that. Do you think the safety hearings at Point Conception... could have anything to do with the speed of the investigation? Same utility company trying to get a license on a new plant. You are up here looking for a friend, aren't you? You wouldn't be asking questions just to get a story? I wish I were. I'm not an investigative reporter. I don't like reporters... because most of them feel that the only good news is bad news. And, oh, God, they give our industry a very rough time. Excuse me. We'll see you in the morning. Listen, nice to meet you. Good night. Don't you think that reporters serve a public function? There's Woodward, Bernstein. Why don't you ask me a ''public function'' question... and I'll tell you whether I do or I don't. All right. Was the public at any time in danger as a result-- Miss Wells, could I have your autograph? Oh, my God, it is! I thought he was kidding. - I told you. - You look just like on TV. Our little girl watches you all the time. - Who shall I make it out to? - To Cindy. C-I-N-D-Y. Here tonight in my bar... we've got that most beautiful TV personality... Miss Kimberly Wells, with us! Okay, bring her on! All right! Let me see that. That's unreal. Wait. Where were we? You were asking me a public function question. Right. Was the public in any danger at any time as a result of the accident? I'm using that word deliberately because I think an investigative reporter would. Jack, watch yourself. You're gonna get yourself on TV. Excuse me. Let me try to explain something... that, unfortunately, people do not understand. These plants are designed for the possibility of an accident. Every conceivable thing that could go wrong has been taken into consideration. Hell, we've got a quality control that's only equaled by NASA. Every component, every one of them... is tested and then is tested again. Every critical weld is radiographed. Every single thing is checked. It's double-checked. It's rechecked. - Everything. - You haven't answered the question. All right. In anything that man ever does, there's some element of risk. That's why we have what we call defense-in-depth. That means backup systems, two backup systems. You were there. You saw what happened. There was no leakage of radiation. You know why? The system works. Even with a faulty relay, a stuck valve, that system works. There was no accident. - Can I get you another drink? - No, thanks. I have to get up in the morning. I'm covering the migration of the gray whale... at my Live At Noon spot tomorrow from Point Mugu. Jesus, you're halfway there. Why don't you spend the night somewhere around here? Then in the morning you just slide over the mountains. I've got a stack of things I've gotta read. - And you gotta find your friend. - And I have to find my friend. - Thank you. - Thank you. Good night. When you turn on your lights, think ten percent me. Beg your pardon? That's the amount of power that CG&E supplies you. - Good night. - Good night. Thank you, Miss Wells. - Got your map? - Yeah. You know where you're going? Okay, I'll follow you. - I just talked to Richard. - Where is he? He told me to tell you if you want the film... he's out at Point Conception at the safety hearing. Some big demonstration there. You got great timing, kid. Hold on a second. We may change our plans. Can I speak to Mac? Get a crew down here and clean this up. Tell your boys to go over this pump. I want them to check every flange, every seal... every rivet and nut in the whole loop. Stay on top of it. I want a full report at the end of each shift. Okay. Right. Let's go,Jack. We've gotta talk. Damn it, that could be very serious. I know it. What the hell are we gonna do? We've gotta tear the pump down and get a complete inspection. You know we can't. That would keep us down for at least two weeks. - How the hell are we gonna find out-- - Now, look. - The leak came from a recirc pump-- - You don't know that. Wait a minute. We'll tighten up the seals, and we'll test it. - Let's not tear the whole pump apart. - How are we really going to find-- Put TV monitors on the pump and run it up to 1 00% of rate of speed. - That might tell us what's happening. - That might tell us what's happening. I want you to get right on top of this. Test it as soon as possible. I sure ain't lookin' forward to calling 'em downtown. They're gonna crap. I told 'em we'd be back on-line by 3:00. I gotta run. I'll see you later. To the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board... these are pictures of children we love. Since these children cannot be here... we ask that you consider them in making your decision. They and others like them will be the ones... who will inherit the consequences of your actions. Now the names of the children. Ronald Borsak, 5 years old. Tony Bulotte, 7. Robert Brimble, 1 1 /2. Douglas Brown, 2. Arnold Calfie, 1 4. Ernest Chollet, 1 0. Dean Smith, 1 2. Juan Garcia, 3. Lonnie Lewis, Scott Lewis, 1 2. Blake Hopefield, 2. Eric Jones, 5. -Steven Lance, 1 3. - Richard! Greg, excuse me one minute. I have to talk to this lady. - Sure. - Thank you. Did you miss me, huh? I don't believe you. Where have you been? Where's the film? They know you stole it. If you don't get it back tomorrow night, Jacovich is gonna call the cops. - Okay. - What? Come on. I want to show you something. - I'm doing my spot out front. - I'm in room E309. - I need that film! - I understand. I promise. E309, all right? You wait for me! That's good. You got these people in the background. It's a lot tighter. Right over there. - What? Here? - Right there. Were you thinking them in the background and a tight two-shot with me and-- - That'd be great. - How much time do we have? Oh, God. The sun's gonna be right in my eyes. - Anyway, who have you got for me? - We have a couple of people. The top two right there. This man's pro-nuke. We're going with the redhead out to the beach as she does a whale story, right? - Stand by, Minicam. - What's she doing? A nuclear story? She's gonna do hard news? Hang by. I'll ad-lib it. Now here's Kimberly Wells with a report from Point Conception. - Go, Kimberly. - I'm speaking with Al Baietti. - He's a certified health physicist. - I hopeJacovich is nowhere near a set. You have concerns about health and safety measures and nuclear energy. - Correct? - Correct. Studio Control. One moment, please. Why is the licensing of this plant important to California? Mr.Jacovich. The licensing of any energy source is... - Hi, Don. -important to our country as a whole. I want the cameras here, here and here: D3, 5 and 7. I need somebody to stand by in the diesel generator room. I'm gonna run a pump test at 1 300. What is that? -Now, opinions from those who oppose it. -Demonstrators at the hearings. Watch these bozos. You won't believe it. - Your name, please. - Hazel Washburn. I'm a housewife. I have 6 grandchildren, 2 of whom I brought with me today. I'm out here protesting because I'm frightened about nuclear energy. How you gonna keep your grandkids warm in wintertime? - How's she gonna use her hair dryer? - Quiet. What do we do in case of an accident? What have they done really to be absolutely sure that... the waste disposal is taken care of?. That hasn't been answered. - We still goin' on-line at 3:00? - According to DeYoung. - Who is it? - It's Kimberly. It's all right. It's okay. This is the lady I was tellin' you about. - You can't show this-- - Listen to what the man's got to say. - Who are these men? - Guy on the right is Elliot Lowell. He's a physics professor. The other guy is a nuclear engineer. - You can stop it here. - Yeah. When I saw it, I thought we'd better show it to you. What do you think? I may be wrong, but I would say you're probably lucky to be alive. For that matter, we might say the same for the rest of Southern California. - Steady as a rock. - Tell 3 5 to go to 1 1 0. Wait a minute. We're at the top of the scale. I got a technician in the diesel engine room. He's got it rigged to go up to 1 1 0. We watch it on the monitor. Okay. Go ahead. Take it to 1 1 0. Okay, fine. The seals are holding. Take it back down to normal and off. Go back on-line this afternoon as planned. Leave it a minute. In a reactor scram, which is apparently what they're having at this point... the system operates automatically for ten minutes. They obviously have a problem. Watch. - Could you stop it right there? - Yeah. A problem they have to deal with manually. - It's a stuck valve of some sort. - How do you know it's a stuck valve? Because I was there last night looking for you, and I talked toJack Godell. He told me it was a stuck valve. - You talked to him last night? - Yes, that's right. Can you start it up again? Whatever stuck valve it was... it's forcing them to deal with the reactor water level. From their behavior, it looks pretty serious. As I remember the control room layout... the annunciators they're concerned with... are also in the area of the core water level. I don't know. They might have come close to exposing the core. If that's true, then we came very close to the China Syndrome. The what? If the core is exposed for whatever reason... the fuel heats beyond core heat tolerance in a matter of minutes. Nothing can stop it. It melts right down through the bottom of the plant... theoretically to China... but, of course, as soon as it hits groundwater... it blasts into the atmosphere and sends out clouds of radioactivity. The number of people killed would depend on which way the wind is blowing. Render an area the size of Pennsylvania permanently uninhabitable... not to mention the cancer that would show up later. Okay, in there is D3, D8s. R6. Perfect. Perfect. And perfect. ''D.B. Royce.'' Herman, we got a serious problem. - Pump checked out okay, didn't it? - Static tests don't tell us anything. Jack, listen to me. You ran the damn thing up to 1 1 0% of rate of speed. That is not gonna tell us what will happen if we ever shut down again. If we scram at full power, any sudden shock-- - But that's only-- - Goddamn it! Will you listen to me? - Take it easy! -Just once! I'm sorry. I decided to go through the quality assurance reports. I came across irregularities... in the contractor's documentation of the pump support structure. So I decided to double-check the welding X rays. This is just a sample. They're identical, Herman. It's the same picture over and over. No contractor can possibly supply every stupid document the government asks for. So they didn't take all the pictures they were supposed to. So what? - These X rays are six years old. - So are those welds down there. - For God's sake,Jack-- - You listen to me! We should get new radiographs of the pump support structure. What? That's absurd. You know how long that would take? What it would cost? $1 5 million to $20 million. Forget it! Go to the control room and start her up. We got to get back on-line today. The company is losing half a million bucks a day. Start her up. Borden, go get samples of the service water. - Have Health Physics run an analysis. - Yes, sir. Barney, did you check out the auxiliary feedwater pumps? Sure did. Lube oil flow and bearing temperatures are A-okay. - Drain valve at station 47 is clear. - Fine. - How you comin',Jack? - Fine. - Almost 3:00. - Reactor's on hot standby. The turbine is on turning gear. Well, all right. Load Dispatch. Load Dispatch, this is Ventana, leaving hot standby... approaching power per normal procedure. I'll contact you when we're ready to synchronize the generator. We expect to be back on the grid in a couple of hours. We got a clear board,Jack. We got a clear board. Follow normal sequence for rod withdrawal up to the top of the S.R.M.s. Group one. Group three. Group five. Group seven. Group two. Group four. Have these films developed as soon as possible. - Mr. Royce? - Yeah. - Can I speak to you for a minute? - Sure. My name is Jack Godell. I'm a shift supervisor at Ventana. What can I do for you? We had a problem at the plant a couple of days ago. Yeah, I heard, but I heard everything checked out fine. - You're going back on the line today. - We're back on the line. Did you sign for these X rays? That's my signature. What about it? - You signed the same one over and over. - All the welds are fine. - How do you know if you didn't check? - Every weld I checked was fine. - How many didn't you check? - I said all the welds were fine. How can you say all the welds are fine? The plant may not be safe. That plant is perfectly safe. We may have a serious problem. I don't have time to go through every X ray. I get a straight answer or else. - Now, how many and which ones? - I don't remember. - There's more where those came from. - You know the procedures. There's no problem. Don't make a problem. Those welds have held for six years. They'll hold for 6,000 more. - I'm goin' to the N.R.C. - Wait a minute. - Get off me. - Think it over! You're talkin' about a billion-dollar lawsuit. It'll send them into receivership. Will you wait a minute? - Slow down! Goddamn it! - Get your hands off me! You're not dealing with some pissant public utility company. This is Foster-Sullivan, one of the world's biggest construction companies. They've got their own security men. Do you hear what I'm saying? I hope I don't have to spell it out for you. You gotta think that over! Wait! They have their own security men! - Hey, Redman. - Yeah. - We got a problem. - I'm sorry, Don. - The whales will be there tomorrow. - She was supposed to cover the whales! It was scheduled. We advertised on radio. I want to see her the minute she gets back. I want to talk to you later too! Who is it? It's Kimberly Wells. I need to talk to you. It's very important. - Who the hell is that? - My cameraman. It's all right. You lied to me last night when you told me it was a stuck valve. - It was a stuck valve. - It was not. - Did Kimberly tell you I filmed it? - You what? I took that footage up to the Point Conception hearings... and showed it to a nuclear engineer. You almost uncovered the core, Mr. Godell. You lied to me last night. We're not gonna leave here until you tell us what happened at the plant. So some antinuclear nut tells you we almost uncovered the core! But we didn't uncover it, did we? We stopped it in time for one reason. I told you that! The system works. That's not the problem! If that is not the problem, then what the hell is? I love that plant. That's my whole life. - What is the problem? - The shudder. The damned shudder. The vibration that I felt during the turbine trip that bothered me. And it sure didn't bother anybody else. Then when I'm checking it, I find that some idiot... phonied the welding X rays. I just cannot believe a man would deliberately... falsify the records of a nuclear reactor. - Holy shit. - That means the plant's not safe. It means that vibration was a warning. The plant should be shut down. Every one of those welds should be re-X-rayed. We're talking about millions of dollars, aren't we? We don't want to talk about that. And no one will believe me. But if they ever put too much pressure on that pump... and they rupture those pipes-- It's the China Syndrome. That's possible. Would you go on television with this and tell this to the public? An hour ago, I threatened to go to the N.R.C. and a man threatened my life. Who threatened you? The bastard that works for the company that did it. The same company that built Point Conception. If I got some of those X rays to you and I stayed out of it... could you get those entered as evidence at the hearings? - Lowell will present them. - Would he do it? - I'll make sure of it. - Wait-- I'll convince the station to send me up there with a mobile unit. That way we can be sure it'll be on the air. - Wait-- - I'm gonna miss my 6:00. - Wait! - I'll call you tonight. We'll work out the transfer. I don't think I should get them to either of you two. I may get followed. Get me somebody that you trust. - I'll get there early in the morning. - Don't leave here. - Thank you. - Call me later. Jesus, what am I-- -Stand by. Commercial on V-1. Roll V-1. - Roll V-1, please. Five, four, three... two, one. - Fade up, please. - Where the hell is Tasha? Ask Tasha to step in for a moment. We want to look at her on camera three. Tell her to hurry up. We're on the air. Boy, is that hot! Can you do anything about that dress? Hello. I'm sorry. No, she never showed up. Thirty seconds. Stand by to roll. Preset, please. Camera two, is that as wide as you can get? - Thank you, buddy. - Lock it down for the opening shot. Stand by. Coming up on 1 5 seconds. Quiet in the studio, please. - Stand by, studio. - Come through with your wide shot. - Go ahead. Ask her to step out. - V-1, clear. Set for your next piece. - She's here! - Tell her to hurry. - Stand by to roll. - Ten seconds. Kimberlyjust walked in. Five seconds. - Five, four, three, two-- - Here we go. This is Channel 3 Update, Southern California's most complete TVnewscast. So nice of you to drop by, Kimberly. Thank you. Cutting it a little close, aren't we, Kimberly? Kimberly Wells with ''California Close-up. '' Now, Pete Martin. Good evening. Another terrorist bombing in the Middle East. The Los Angeles school board has authorized a pay raise for teachers. Three people have died in a head-on collision-- - When am I on? - I don't know. - About five minutes in? - What is going on? Where have you been? GetJacovich. I've got a story. - Richard, I want that goddamn film. - Kiss my ass. You'll get your film, Mac. GetJacovich. - Roll V-2, please. - Three, two, one. At least one storm-related death was reported. We'll get the phony X rays first thing in the morning. Then we'll work out the transfer, have them up there for you by noon. It might be a great story, but we'll give it to Frank. It's not your job. I know it's not my area, as you define my role at the station. But I am tired of birthday parties with tigers and lions. It's my story, my exclusive. I want to do it. - Who's the guy at the plant? - He needs to be anonymous. Dr. Lowell said he would be very happy to submit the evidence. Elliot Lowell is not an objective source. That's not balanced reporting. - If you don't want it, someone will. - Kimberly, you're on. There are still stations in this town that like hard news. - Now to two and then to one, right? - Right. Everybody moving in. That's right. We'll be crossing in three, two, one. And up two. Cue Pete. Now it's time for ''California Now'' with Kimberly Wells. What do you have for us? A few words about a veterinarian who makes house calls on sick fish. Or is it aquarium calls? Anyway, Dr. E.G. Steward advises the owners... to imagine themselves in their pet's place... inside the aquarium, thinking like a fish. That way they won't have to wonder if it's time to change the water. They'll just know. The doctor offers classes as well as house calls... ranging from ick, fin congestion and tail rot... to fish lice, popeye and bladder bloat. The most common mysterious ailment that fishes suffer? It's people problems. Poison sprays, dirty hands and cigarette ashes in the tank. - I guess nobody's immune. - It's quite a service. When was the last time someone came to your house when you were sick? To the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board and the public... To the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board and the public... I am speaking for my friends who choose not to speak. But these hearings are not for the purpose of weighing public sentiment. The N.R.C. has held 60 licensing hearings to date... and not once has a license been refused. This country is proceeding with the building of nuclear plants. Yet we do not have a program for the safe disposal of nuclear wastes. Any further words are pointless. - Well, what do you think? - Honest to God, I don't know. Do you think it's the film? Your five minutes is up. Thank you. Dr. Elliot Lowell. Mr. Chairman. If the chairman would excuse me, I'm expecting crucial information... which may arrive in 20 or 30 minutes. If I could have that much of a delay, I would appreciate it. Granted. What the hell are you doing, you dumb-- Son of a bitch! What are you doing? Hey! Hey, man! What? What are you doing? I am also concerned about the misinformation... in my opinion with regards to nuclear waste. Much is made of the fact that these wastes are radioactive. Therefore, there's some special problem this radioactivity produces. One hears it is necessary to wait for centuries... before this radioactivity decays to a safe level. Channel 3, KXLA, Los Angeles. Unfortunately, the five major U.S. tire manufacturers... no longer cover their tires against road hazards. Fortunately, one company still does. Winston. If any passenger car tire purchased-- - Yes? - It's Kimberly. - Did you connect with Hector? - A couple of hours ago. He hasn't shown up, and Lowell's about to go on. - You got to come up and help us. - What? You got to tell them what you told us last night. - I understand. - Please hurry. My God. I would like to remind the members of the audience-- David, getJim to call the station. See if they've heard from Hector. Say,Jim, call the desk. See if Hector's checked in, please. Thank you for the opportunity to put this matter on record. Thank you, Mr. Baietti. Dr. Lowell, has your information arrived yet? No. Mr. Chairman, if I might request another hour? Dr. Lowell, we have a very busy agenda. We'll try to schedule you for another day. We're going to take a 20-minute recess. If you need me, I'll be downtown. The Highway Patrol just called. Hector's been in an accident. It's about 1 0 miles south on Highway 6. - What? - Hector's been in an accident. Would you hold these for me? Hector's been in an accident. He's on Highway 6. Excuse me. Would you be sure Godell's on the agenda? -Jesus, Mr. Godell. - I'm sorry. He could get himself shot driving up here like that. What the hell is that? Hey, Godell, what's going on? Easy. I'm here to help. Don't fight me. - You ready? - Vital signs are stable. Go ahead. - Cover up his face. - You got it. - Is he alive? - He's alive. - Is he gonna make it? - He's gonna be all right. It's okay. He's gonna make it. - How high do you plan on taking this? - I can't hear you. How high do you plan on going? - Hi,Jack. - See ya,Jack. Yeah, okay. I'll take care of it. Okay. Ted, how high are we? It sounds like the power's up. Yeah, we'll be at full power by midnight. You cannot run it at full! We can't risk another scram! - What's the matter? You been drinking? - Drinking? There may be a defect in the pump support structure. - Listen! - I got my orders! There was a vibration! So help me God, a sudden surge could kick that off again. Go home. Why don't you just go home? - What's the matter with Jack? - I don't know. - Where we at? - We're at 7 5% full power. Recirc flow at 80% normal. - Control Room. - Take it to 93% with the recirc. Right. Yes? - Group one. - What are you trying to do,Jack? - Leave it there,Jim. -Jesus Christ,Jack. Just get out. Go on. Get out. Get out! - You can't do this,Jack. - Oh, I mean it, Ted. Get out. Everybody out. Let's go upstairs and see what's goin' on. It's all right, Hector. Hang on. All right, easy! What are you trying to do, finish him off? You can't possibly believe we had anything to do with this accident! - It wasn't a goddamn accident! - I need to talk to Kimberly. Godell has taken over the control room. He's got a gun. He wants to talk to you. Okay, Herman, someone's trying to tamper with the security circuits. If you don't tell them to knock it off, I'll flood the containment area. God help you and your company. Is that understood? Ted, he's onto you guys. We have to find another way to get into the control room. - You better find it fast. - Here she is. Thank you for coming. I hope you can convince him to come out. - Get him on the phone. - Yes, sir. Jack, I got Kimberly Wells here. Bring her down alone. He wants you to go down there alone. - Follow me. - I'm right behind ya. Bill, step out where I can see ya. Okay, fine. Kimberly, when you hear the bolt slide, come through the door alone. Go ahead. What happened to your friend? - There was an accident. - No accident. I know. The radiographs are gone. Oh, those bastards. They were chasing me. I came here because I knew they couldn't get in. Once I get here I find the idiots are going to put the plant up at full power. - I don't think the pump can take that. - What are you going to do? What I would have done if I'd have gotten to those hearings. You're going to interview me on television. - You mean from here? - Yeah, here. Now. Is there any way I can talk to my cameraman up there? Yes. He wants us to interview him. You'll just have to talk him out of it for his own safety. We've been able to keep this in the family, so to speak. But one call to the outside and the sheriff will be here with a SWAT team. You get him to come out, and we'll listen to anything he has to say. We don't want anybody to get hurt. I wouldn't mess around. The guy just said... either he makes a public statement... or he's gonna flood the containment with radiation. - Can he do that? - Yes, sir. All he has to do is open those valves. Right now, he can do pretty much anything he wants. If he floods the containment with radiation... may as well take a shovel to this place and bury it. You tell him we'll do it. He can go on the air, anything. - Mr. McCormack-- - Shut up, Gibson. Joe, you keep an eye on this gentleman. Gentlemen. All right, they agreed. I'm not only gonna call your station... I'm callin'every goddamn TVstation in L.A. They agreed. I can't take responsibility for this. What's your alternative? Let this maniac wash out a billion-dollar investment? This buys time. It'll take the press an hour to get here. I wouldn't count on it. I'm counting on you to take care of the goddamn press. You do your job, and I'll do mine. Yes, sir. What the hell's holding you people up? You spent a fortune on security in this place. The whole thing is designed to prevent a forced entry into that control room. Goddamn it. I'm tired of hearing what you can't do. I wanna know what you can do. Our only other choice is to try to scram the plant. That process can be triggered without Godell knowing, then it's on automatic. That should distract him long enough for us to get in there. You think you can do it without that lunatic catching you? We can sure as hell try. Scram the son of a bitch. No, Tom, that won't work for us. Who's the man standing up there? McCormack, chairman of the board, CG&E. Are we in danger with this plant operating? I don't think so. I brought it down to 7 5%. Why don't you just shut it down? I shut it down, I lose power. As long as we're on-line, I'm a threat. By getting control of the generator circuits... we can cause a generator and a turbine trip. That would eventually cause the reactor to scram. You realize that's exactly what Godell's spooked about? A scram-- Whose side are you on? Maybe you'd like to give him a hand? How long will this take you? I got to bridge around a dozen circuits. They all terminate in this room one way or the other. Could take me 30 minutes. Could take me an hour. I can't say. Get started. I'm going to start off with just a general introduction... to explain to people where we are and then I'll introduce you. You should say who you are, what your job is here... and how long you've worked here. Have you thought about what you're going to say? You want a cup of coffee? Yeah. Want cream and sugar? Agent Four, over. Level six, report in. It's going to be fine. Agent 1 4, report to the staging area. Joe, tell Mr. McCormack the police cars are arriving. Hey! Right here! Hey! Come on! Right here! Come on, Mac! We have men on levels seven and eight. Keep three or four officers out here with us. Over. - Is Kimberly in there already? - Yes, she's inside. - You gonna take a crew in there? - Right! Just like I did it before, right through the glass. Get the sound through the intercom. Use all available light. We'd like to ask you a few questions. Can you give us the name-- Let's go! Come on! - Are we on the air right now? - Yes, we are. We don't have anything to say now. If you'd just be patient, you'll get it. - Can you give us his name? - Okay, over here! Over here! - Can you give us the name of the man? - Godell. - What the hell is goin' on? - Excuse me. Is this a SWAT team? Come on back. Come on back. Come on. You got it. Come on! What the hell is a SWAT team doin' there? Where in the hell is the battery pack? - Is he armed? - There are rumors-- Have your men follow me up this back elevator. Let's go. They'll be comin'up through the bottom of the plant. Stand by. T-B-3-1 7. -Negative. That's a front circuit panel. -Let's go. Studio B, this is remote. We're feeding you tone and bars. Do you copy? - Okay,Joe. Send 'em out. - We've got tone and bars. Okay, Minicam, we have bars. Give us picture. There goes the picture breakup again. Video, do whatever you can to get camera two back on us. - How close are we? - We could go anytime. - What you're doing is irresponsible. - I just can't hear you, Gibson. They're here. Set up on sticks right here. - You got it. - Thank you, Don. I want a two-shot right there at the console, all right? - Got it. - Gotta take sound from this speaker. Okay, we made it. Churchill's down in the van. The press is everywhere. Let's just work out this sound thing. We'll be ready to go. - All right? - Okay. It's gonna be a few minutes. There's a lot of press. Stay clear of that TV monitor. You gotta get through two doors. He's got 'em both secured from the inside. Get DeYoung right now. What do you do to get the voices to come out on the loudspeaker? Yes, right here. That button. - The other button locks it. - Do it. - Lock it open? - Yeah. - You all set? - Okay? - You want to give us a voice level? - Testing, one, two, three, four. Kimberly, you move a little closer to the speaker. Testing, testing. This is Kimberly Wells. Just get a little closer together. - What's the next one? - T-B-4-6. That's a ground wire. Affirmative. Go to T-B-3-9. That's a ground wire. About ready. - Your levels look fine. - You got picture. KXLA, Los Angeles. - Pete to the phone, please. - We're getting close. Just checking levels. Hold up something white for a color test and stand by. Let's see. - Everything okay? - He's setting the color balance on one. Okay, fine. Let's get this show on the road. Stand by. Ready to go. - How do you know when-- - When the red light comes on, we're on. Goddamn it. Do something. The son of a bitch is about to go on the air. How's that for you, David? Stand by and let's get it goin'. - Hello, Spindler? Come in. - Yeah, DeYoung. We almost got it. The minute we get it, I'll call ya back. -Just about ready. - Do something. My head is-- Camera one. Stand by, camera two. Camera one. Stand by, camera two. Camera two. Go, Pete. This is Pete Martin in the Channel 3 newsroom. We interrupt our regular programming-- Power plant where an armed employee-- -And is demanding to make-- - Ready? - Exclusive, live coverage-- - Stand by. - Kimberly? - Take. Go. This is Kimberly Wells. I'm speaking to you from the control room... of the Ventana Nuclear Power Plant. With me is Mr.Jack Godell who has taken control of this plant by force... and has demanded to make a statement. Mr. Godell? I'm a shift supervisor here. I have been here since before it ever opened. I want you to know one thing. I don't want to hurt anybody. I'm not gonna try to contaminate the state of California. I just want you to-- Monday last at 3:36 p.m.... we had an event happen that-- - We had an accident happen here. - Okay. -Jesus. - Nobody was hurt. It was more serious than you were ever led to believe. It was human error. A faulty relay in the generator circuit caused the breakers to trip open. Don't be so technical. I know that sounds ridiculous. That relay is a $ 1 0 or $ 1 2 item. But it protects the generator. On top of that, this could happen. See, that's the reactor water level. In the water level, there is a pen, and the pen stuck. Also, because of the stuck pen, we got the wrong reading. We tried to keep additional feedwater from entering the system. In actuality, that water level was dangerously low. With the main steam line isolated, we only had one auxiliary feed pump... to get more water back into that core. But that's not-- - Come on. - But that's not why I'm here. - I'm not makin'any sense. - It's all right. This is so complex. There's something else. You see, it's-- We got it! All right, DeYoung, you give us the word, we'll cut the circuit. - Okay. - It's so complex. It-- I-- It's simple. It's simple. - We're ready to begin the scram. - It's terribly complex. It's very difficult. The-- I mean, that happened, but that's not why I'm-- - The vibration. - The vibration was not normal. There was a vibration. Nobody will-- I know the vibration was not normal. - Then do it, for Christ's sake. - I know this plant. - What's that? - Dave, you okay? - Oh, my God! - Cut him off. We're losing picture. What happened? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.! Why? You idiots! You idiots! - Ladies and gentlemen-- - No.! Please.! God.! No.! - The lights flashed, but I think-- - He's gone nuts. We've lost our picture from the Ventana Nuclear Plant. - Oh, my God, no.! -Are we off the air? Is there no sound? Please! God! No! Oh, please, God! Oh, please! You idiots! - Stop! - Stop! Stop! No, no, stop! Stop it! - Somebody check the feedwater. - Have you secured the control room? - Get a doctor. - Somebody get a medic! Unit Two, this is Command Center. A medic team is on the way. Unit Two, a medic team is on the way. Over. I can feel it. - What did he say? - He said, ''I feel it.'' I feel it. Oh, my God, Ted. It's that pump. -Check isolation valves! Main feedwater! -Stabilize the reactor! - Check feedwater valves! - Everybody stay at your stations! Let's get the water level under control. Get D.C. backup power to the inverter. Where are those lights? Don't anybody move! Stay at your stations! - Can't get emergency lighting to work! - Stay at your stations, everybody! - Hold on! - The thing's comin' apart! Damn it! Shut up! Christ. It's over. It's stable. If you just tuned in, let me take a moment to recap. At about 4:00 this afternoon, an armed man with a gun... an employee of the Ventana plant, Jack Godell, took over the control room. As you saw a moment ago, an interview started. We were about three minutes into it when we lost the signal. - However, we do have a second Minicam-- - Pete, we've got picture now. No sound, but we have picture. I'm told we're about ready to switch back live to Ventana... to our second unit which is locatedjust outside-- There you see it. You can see a very big crowd outside the plant. We don't have audio yet, but this is the picture of what's going on. Don't deviate. Just stick to the prepared text. - Can you tell us what's happened? - Would you just gather around? - Get out of the way. - I have an announcement to read to you. A few minutes ago, the situation inside was resolved. The Ventana Nuclear Plant is secure. - I emphasize at no time-- - Did any of it get on the air? Enough to make Godell look like a lunatic. Press releases will be passed out to you shortly. I'djust like to stress that the public was never in any danger. - Was there any damage? - When can we get our cameras inside? There was some damage done to the plant, but it was slight. It's been contained. - What happened? - An emotionally disturbed employee... was humoredjust long enough to get the situation under control. - Had he been drinking? - We had a report he'd been drinking. - Was there any damage? - Was anyone injured? Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Herman DeYoung and Ted Spindler. Mr. DeYoung is superintendent of the plant. Mr. Spindler was in charge of the operation throughout. -How did you stop Godell? -What happened to the television camera? Minicam, watch your picture. Fight for it. There's Kimberly. - Mr. DeYoung, a few minutes ago-- - Kimberly Wells,you were inside. - No, please, let me ask a question. - We're losing the picture. - Please.! Let me ask a question. - Terry,just come around. A few minutes ago,Jack Godell was shot dead in front of me. - How many times was he shot? - Why was he killed? Just a minute, Miss Wells. The man was emotionally disturbed. I'm tellin' ya-- -Who ordered SWAT into the control room? -I told you. He was out of control. He was dangerous. They had no choice in the matter. Mr. Spindler, do you agree with that? Was Jack Godell emotionally disturbed? Mr. Spindler, do you agree with that? Was Jack Godell emotionally disturbed? - Did he have reason to be disturbed? - I don't know. Mr. Gibson said he was drinking. Is it true? - I don't know. - Don't know? How do you account for his behavior tonight? What did he say to you? Thank you, Mr. Spindler, Mr. DeYoung. - That's all now. - What did he say to you, Mr. Spindler? He said he thought this plant ought to be shut down. Do you agree with that? Should it be shut down? It's not my place to say. If it's not your place, whose is it? - We have to go-- - Whose is it? If there's nothing to hide, let him speak. Whose place is it? - Come on, Ted. - Wait a minute! Jack Godell was my best friend. These guys are painting him as some kind of a loony. He wasn't a loony. He was the sanest man I ever knew in my life. And he had reason to believe this plant was not safe? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he wouldn't have done what he did if there wasn't somethin'to it. Jack Godell wasn't that kind of guy. I didn't know all the particulars. He told me a few things. There's gonna be an investigation this time. The truth will come out, and people will know my friend Jack wasn't a lunatic. He was a hero. Jack Godell was a hero. I gotta go. - We gotta do a wrap. -Spindler's comments were personal. Hurry up. Come on. Let's go. We're on the air live. Can you give us more background? He was a close friend ofJack Godell and obviously very distraught. Come on, Kimberly. Hold on. Come on! Hold on! - Just a minute. - Remind Kimberly we're still live. Let me repeat myself. Ted Spindler is only an employee. - He does not speak on behalf-- - Hustle it up. We're on the air. - Pete, I metJack-- - How many times was he shot? - We're on the air. - I metJack Godell two days ago. I'm convinced that what happened tonight... was not the act of a drunk or a crazy man. Jack Godell was about to present evidence... that he believed would show that this plant should be shut down. I'm sorry I'm not very objective. Let's just hope it doesn't end here. This is Kimberly Wells live at Channel 3. Just introduce a commercial, Pete. Go right to commercial. We'll be back with more on the Ventana Nuclear Power Plant takeover... by one of its employees right after this. Roll logo. Okay, F-2. - Incredible. - She did a hell of a good job. I must say, I'm not surprised. A man is dead inside tonight. We're not exactly sure why or what happened. The SWATteam appeared on the scene and went into the control room. Something took place there that triggered that action. Mr. Godell died at the controls of this atomic plant. Val Clenard, Channel 7 News. Good night. It turns the food so you don't have to.
