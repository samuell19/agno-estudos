Hi. - Hi - Do you mind if I join you? Oh, I'm waiting for someone. Boyfriend? No, just... just a friend. Ah. Look, I never do this, but I thought maybe... I have a boyfriend. He just can't be here right now. I'm in a long-time distance relationship. Oh. Wow. Yeah. How do you do it? Oh, God. Hmmm. Hmm. Hey. Benny. Hmm? Benny, wake up. What do you want? What time did you get home? Hmmm. Four. Uh-huh. Okay, you need to replace the AC. I will. Okay, but today, all right? There's going to be a heat wave. Hmm, not this year. Okay, but in my year, it's gonna be 100 degrees outside and I don't wanna come home to an oven, okay? I'm suffocating. Okay. I'll do it. Okay. Uh-hmm. If you don't fix it, I will. I mean, you remember what happened with the shower head. Okay? Oh. So what happened with the shower head? She installed a new one because she wanted a stronger water pressure and she inadvertently bifurcated the shower into two separate timelines. And since the lease is under my name and my year, any alterations she makes impacts the time-space compression and limits where we can coexist. Yeah, okay, that makes sense. And we used to have really good shower sex. Did you try amalgamating your split timelines by replacing your shower head with the exact same model she installed? We tried that, it didn't work. What happens if you run the bath? Sorry. I mean, I know a couple in a six-month long-time distance relationship and they just got engaged. Yeah, but that's six months. I mean, Benny is three years behind me. Yeah, but you two are so great together. How would you know that? I mean, you've never met him. You can't ever meet him. I'm just trying to tell you what you wanna hear. Honestly, I couldn't do it. I love him, it's just... I mean, I don't know if he'll ever catch up to me, you know. Hey. Hey. Did you eat? No, I was waiting for you. Do you wanna order something? Bombay Shack is closing. Yeah, I told you that. It's a juicery now. Why do you think I keep on making you order from there? Because you're bossy. Can I have some more? Please? Please sir. Oh, my god, I was just thinking that! Isn't it crazy that some phrases are so embedded with pop-culture that we can't use them in everyday life anymore? No. It's like "I am your father". When would you ever need to say that? "You will listen to me, I am your father." Mmmmmm... Fine, okay. But see what I mean, right? Our mind can't interpret it any other way. Oh! Or like the other day, I was carrying groceries and I was like, "Hold the door!" "Hold the door!"? Hodor? Hoooodor! Hodor? Hodor like from Game of Thrones? Yeah. Is that a spoiler? Are you watching Game of Thrones without me? I'm so... How far are you? I'm caught up. But that's our fucking show, Marie! Oh my god, it's everybody's fucking show, okay? All my coworkers talk about it, what do you want me to do? Like avoid spoilers for three years? So, you just sit there and pretend to cry when someone fucking died! Yeah! I have. That's exactly what I do. And I do that with a lot of things... - and it's exhausting. - That's so fucked up. Who are you watching Game of Thrones with? I'm not doing Pilates. I fucking hate Pilates. Who are you? I'm sorry. I really don't wanna fight. I'm sorry. So, you weren't doing Pilates? No! I really thought you were getting worked up. I was paranoid that you'll figure it out. So, I started going up and down the stairs at work. I don't know. And on Mondays, I go up and down a whole bunch all the time... during lunch. Oops, sorry. Things will get better. When? Benny? Are you here? Okay. Ugh. Hey? Why is the front door open? Sorry, I'm late. You could have called. That was a joke. Okay, obviously. Is everything okay? Well, you didn't fix the AC. Hey, I'll fix it. No, you're not gonna fix it. Okay? You don't wanna fix it because you're cheap and suffering gives you a god complex. Okay. I was offered a promotion today. That's... that's amazing. What is the... Actually, it doesn't matter. Hmm. We should celebrate. Well, yeah, that was my first thought. Oh, I can't wait to celebrate with Benny. But I can't call him or text him or email him or go out to an actual dinner with him or leave fucking Brooklyn because he doesn't exist right now. And if I take this promotion, we could exist even further apart in time. And I know you don't think that will happen again, but you don't know that, so. I'm sorry. I don't wanna live here anymore. Well, this is the only place where we could be together, so. Do you wanna break up? - Is that what you're saying? - No, I don't wanna break up you. I'm just so sick of this shitty apartment. Our apartment isn't shitty, okay? It's a miracle, and we are not gonna find a better deal. I don't care! I don't want a better deal! Okay?! I want a central AC and a washer and a dryer, and a doorman! I wanna live in Dumbo, okay! All my friends live in Dumbo. What the fuck is so great about Dumbo? Uh, in three years, everything is great about Dumbo. And you know what? I can afford it now. Nice. Real classy. Oh, come on. I didn't mean it like... You know what? No, I'm not gonna apologize because I make more money than you because I chose a career of stability. Okay? You don't think that I'd like to spend all my time, like, water coloring? No! Okay. I hate my job half the time but I do it so that I can afford things that I enjoy like brunch and health insurance, and I could pay for us to take a trip to Santorini, but I can't take you with me because you're still living in the past! Okay. So that's it, hmm? You think I'm living in the past. Yes! Yes, yes! And I'm so sick of this like, "We're both living in our own present" bullshit, okay? I'm not ahead, I'm not in the future, I'm in the now and you're in the past. Do you hear yourself, hmm? How fucking selfish, you sound? Oh my! How can I be selfish when I'm the only one making sacrifices! Okay? I can't talk to you about anything because you have no idea what's going on, all right? You don't know what's on Netflix, what's in New York, what's going on in Syria. - What do you want me to do, huh? - I mean, you have no idea - who our President is. - What do you want me to do?! To be a man and catch up to me like you said you would! Okay? Just like you said that you'd fix the AC and you said that you'd apply the wallpaper that's been sitting in the fucking closet for the past two years! Okay? Just like you said that your friend at Columbia Records was going to "hook you up"! Okay?! It's not gonna happen, Benny! All right?! You're either a doer, or you're a... A what? A loser? A deadbeat? Just say it. Just say it. Just fucking say it! You're holding me back. Then go. Seriously, get the fuck out of here. Okay. Just imagine how far you could get without me. Ten, twenty years, you'll be in your stupid fucking Dumbo with your $50 Avocado Frappuccinos. Don't let me hold you back from having everything you want because it's all about... I'm gonna fucking kill you. Okay. Marie? - Hey. - Jesus. Hey, where were you? What? Where was I? I was here like we planned at 6:00. Where were you? And you couldn't be bother... I was here. I was on time. No, you weren't. Okay, you know what? I can't deal with this right now. I have to go to work, all right? What are you talking about? It's Saturday afternoon. No, it's Friday morning. No, it's... Hey, look. Wait for me? Yeah. Okay. So where do you wanna go first? Brazil? Closer. Umm... Yosemite? Closer? The roof? Okay. Okay. Okay? One... two... three. Oh my god. I'm still here. We're still here. Roof? You still wanna move? - I mean, we could at least... - Oh my god, Marie. This is Tim Mealy with Tonight's Headlines. A group of vampires crossing New York State borders were arrested and later killed by the Silver Bullet Coalition. Some consider the Silver Bullet Coalition a hate group targeting all vampires. Tonight's guest is the leader of VRRA, the Vampire Rights Reform Association. Nicole Shirer, welcome. Thank you, Tim. You know, two years ago, there were 12 million non-violent vampires living in America. The number has reduced to 2 million. What we're witnessing here is a vampire genocide. We'll have that right after this break. Aah. Ah. Hmm. Back with our guest Nicole Shirer with the topic of the recent vampire genocide. So, Nicole, vampires have been known to kill humans. That was 200 years ago, Tim. Although vampires were known to be violent in the 18th and early part of the 19th century but not anymore. Vampires have been peaceful for the last 100 years. They survive completely on synthetic blood which is now being used to bait and capture them. Well, vampire hate groups are on the rise. Several smaller groups have sprung up in the five boroughs. Get your teeth out for a fang check. Hey. Hey, hey! Get in! What's going on? What the fuck? Get back in line! Don't move, you little blood sucker. Wait, what are you doing to him? Get back in line! Hi! Can I help you with something? Oh. Umm... a juice? Martini? Yeah, sure. What are you hiding from? I'm Harlow. I think I'm falling for you. Shit. I... Are you a... Ah, I'm sorry, I... I should have just told you. Are you gonna eat me? Eat you? God! No, I... Listen. I have never killed a human. I've never even tasted human blood. I promise. I was living on synth blood until they started using it to bait us. And what are you living on now? Animal blood. But I try to be sustainable about it. Look, forget it. Wait. I got this. All right. Get a room! Teeth! Holy shit! I can't believe that worked. You didn't have to do that. Yeah, I did. Come on. Come on. Let's get out of here before these fang haters find us. Geri? Everyone's looking for you. People are getting ready to leave. - Okay, Joyce. - Thanks. What's you doin'? Just thinking. Well, can you come back downstairs with me now? All right, thank you. Yeah. Well, that's the last of them. "Sorry for your loss." Everyone means well. No, I know. And, also, thank you so much for everything. I just... You know, he's not waiting for me somewhere. He's not in a better place. He is just gone. Pssh. Actually, you know what? No. He is in here. I don't think you're supposed to... - He is in this urn. - May I just... That's where he is. I understand. You know, you don't, though. You don't understand. Everyone in there is like, "I feel him here. I can feel him." Well, I don't feel him anywhere. And that could have been anyone's fucking funeral, you know? I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. Oh, Joyce. You know what? I'm an asshole. I'm sorry. No. - It's fine. - You're not. Honestly, all I keep thinking of is maybe... I don't know. Maybe we got together too young, you know? Like, somehow, we've used up all our luck or something. What was I talking about? I don't know. We were like 23 years old, you know? I know. I know. So, now, all my memories are with him, you know. I can't buy my favourite sandwich or go grocery shopping or get into bed at night without being reminded by the universe that, like, I'm alone. Geri. And every little thing that I wanna try to accomp... Geri? Geri? Geri? Yes. Yeah. What's going on? I don't know. I'm worried about you. Yeah. Look, go home. Get some rest. I'll come by later. Bring a lasagne. Mrs. Kerchansky? Yeah. I hate to bother you with this. I need someone to sign. I'll take care of it. Um, Joyce, you know what? You are right. I am? Yes, and in here. Yup, I just... I am gonna go home and healing, lasagne time. That sounds great. Yeah. I... What the...? Holy shit! Geri? Hi there. Hi there? I'm... I'm so, so sorry. I think you might think I'm someone else. Geri! Wait! It's so good to see you. Who is that? What is she doing? Geri! - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. - Hey. Hi. You hungry? Yeah. Help yourself. Yum. Oh, God, I think I thought you were... Geri. Geri, no, no, it's okay. You always eat my food. Remember? Hi. Come on. Oh my god! Oh my god! Geri! Please stop! Wait, wait! Wait. Why here? No, no, no, no, no. This is where you're taking me? Okay. Okay. I'm here. Oh. Why did you drive me here? Hello? Am I going nuts? Hey. Ah. I wish I had something fancier. Is beer okay? Beer's great. So, this is my secret spot. It's not super original but I like it. I like to come up here alone and get some space. Watch the city. You are actually the first person I've ever brought up here. Bad first date move? Too cheesy? Did I ruin it already? No, it's beautiful. I miss you so much. I miss you too. Please don't go. Geri! I'm never going to see him again. I mean, you don't know that. The world is a mysterious place, full of strange and unexpected things. Okay. Geraldine, it's time to come home. I... Just come with me. I'm fine. Geri. No. Just come with me. Let's just stay right here. All right, I'll take it. Don't do this again. Geri. Stop it! Just stop it! Oh, no! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Geri, I'm so sorry. I'm so, so, so, so sorry. Wow... It's just beautiful. New tag? Can't even read it. You aren't meant to. Rada. Rada. I don't get it. Radha is a Taino goddess. A guiding spirit. Isn't it not cool when you use something from World Studies? You think they teach you the stuff in school? It's still not cool enough though. Can we go home? Not yet. You know mom complains about the post office running out of those, right? Sungo! You didn't tell her I take them, do you? You know, if I did, you'd get it. That's Cesar. Your stuff is better. Your old stuff. He doesn't do cute kid stuff, and neither do I. Yeah, but you could still. Sometimes. Right? Remember when you used to draw me stories once? Like this one. Shh. You were waiting for him. Shhhhh. We shouldn't follow him, right? How come your bag is so loud? I got paint. How? Don't tell mom, but I borrowed. Borrowed? I grabbed the quarters from the laundry, okay? Come on now. Can we go home? Shh. You kids creepin' on me? Uh, I... You tryin' to draw my spot? I... My sister really likes your stuff. Is that so? You're Cesar? Do you write? She's really good. You speak for her? I, huh, I... I do slaps mostly. I haven't... I haven't painted yet. Chica, you're Dominican? We're Puerto Rican. Got it. You got paint? Maybe you can slap some walls. Kids your entourage, though. Just a second. Wait for me in the house, okay? I'm not supposed to be home alone. Just walk down to Ingram, make a left and you're on our street. Just watch TV or something. And I'll make you a sandwich when I get back. You'll be fine. I will tell mom if you sent me away. This is totally blackmail! I'm serious! Why?! If you blow this for me... Hey, man... He's gonna be lookout. I could hide. Nobody will see me. Sorry, niñito. Little kids attract more attention. Bye, home-sito! I'm sorry. Come on. You know the way home from here. Just walk home by yourself for once. I don't know the way back. I don't feel too good. Fine. Okay. Hide behind here. But if you see a cop or something, come running, okay? All right. Go. Keep up! You wear gloves? Third offense. I ain't getting bagged. That's it?! That little tag? You gotta go big or go home. Sometimes you gotta put toys in their place. Whoa! What the hell are you doing? Uh, I... No, what are you doing? That's ChoKing! You can't tag your toy shit over that. I... I didn't know. Gimme your cans. That ChoKing is a legend. Nobody touches it. That's been there since the 90's. I... I didn't know, okay? Don't lift your shitty work from his art. You done, toy. Come on, Matteo, let's go. Matteo? Matteo? Matteo?! Matteo, this isn't funny! Matteo! Matteo! Mama! I found him. Hey. Your mom's on her way. She went to the Bronx to see Matty's dad. You two are not allowed out of my sight until she gets back. Matteo is not feeling too good. Come on. How long have you been painting? First time. I made a mistake. I painted over someone. What? Who? ChoKing? Whoa. Let me see your bible. My? Your book. ChoKing. That's me. Your letters are too hard to read. And you're biting off all sorts of artists. You need to find your own style. Like this. I didn't... I didn't mean to mess anything up. I didn't know the rules. You don't need nobody to tell you what the rules are. You figure them out for yourself. Blaze your own trails. You were with dudes, right? Yeah. They thought you were a guy. Little brothers can be such a pest, huh? But then you wake up one day and you realize they're grown men. They don't need you so much anymore. Hey. Where's the little guy? He's got the flu. Look, I'm sorry about the other day. Junior went kind of hot. But you can kick with me, that'd be cool. I want my paint back. Junior took my cans and I want them back. Okay. Good. Are you ready? Yeah. That's us. Yeah. What is wrong with you, boy? I need new clothes. Nicholas. You know this is a very difficult time. And it is a miracle that you have a roof over your head and food in that refrigerator. You should be counting your blessings not moping around and being disrespectful. Now what you have to say to your mother? I love you, mommy. Let's pray. Father God in the name of Jesus, we come to you, lifting up our dear sister, Celeste. We ask, oh, God, that You will just strengthen her as she battles this ALS. Amen. Lord, let Your healing power flow through her from the top of her head to the sole of her feet. And, oh, God, we ask You that You would strengthen little Nicholas in this hour. In the mighty name of Jesus. Amen. Amen. Nicholas. Nicholas. Nicholas. Hello? Hello? Where is everybody? Where's Louise? Work. Hmmm. The girl next door gonna come later, afternoon. Hmm. Well, I have some good news. At long last, I have found you a Medicaid bed in a full-time facility. It's actually quite nice. I was shocked. Truly, this is the best we could have hoped for. In Brooklyn? In Manhattan. You'll be near the ALS center, and they'll be able to work out transportation. No more carrying you up and down stairs. But the real point here is once the feeding tube goes in... I want to stay here. Even if you could afford the rent, after the feeding tube goes in, they can only release you to a care facility or to a family member. And that family member simply cannot be Nicholas. You took very, very good care of my son. It's long past time we all started thinking about yours. So what I have here is the living will. Ms. Segal, you have power of attorney? That's correct. These documents will provide medical directives in the event that you are no longer involved... $2,200 for that apartment is insane. It's not even a fake two bedroom. That's a one bedroom. Also, where even are we? Just so I'm totally clear, once you are admitted to the nursing facility, you will be listed DNR/DNI. Do you understand what that means? Thanks so much for showing us the place. It's a little small. Do you have anything bigger? Don't even think about my apartment. My mom's getting better and we're staying here forever. Ha! Yo, you wanna run? I'm waiting on some new ones. Once I get those, I'm gonna be straight. I'll be out there with you. You're finally moving out of this place, then? Isaac. Nicholas... got to live with you... now. See here. I love that boy with all my heart. That boy is my life. And I'll go take him when it's time. Look, man. Celeste can't speak she mind, but I am going to speak it for her. You don't have eyes in your head? Look at her! Let me tell you, when it's time. Nicholas, go on back outside. Hey, daddy. Why you here? I came to see your mother. Nicholas, you got to live... with your father... now. What you mean? What mommy is trying to... Mommy has to go live in a nursing home and you have to go live with your father but you can see her anytime you want. There's a lot of things we haven't still work out! What? There's nothing to work out? Woman! So that's it? You're just giving up? You ain't even gonna try no more? It's not fair... what I put on you. Being here... alone with me. We were fighting, though, right? We were getting by. That's why I'm wearing these ratty-ass clothes and these busted-up sneakers, 'cause we're fighting to survive! Right? If you wanna cry, it's okay. Go on and cry. Every flag I walk by is at half-mast: the church, the post office, the library across the street. I can't remember if anyone important has died. It isn't the anniversary of some tragic event. I don't think. Maybe a priest and a postal worker have died on the same day. Maybe a librarian too. Or maybe we are all in mourning. I can believe that. I believe there's something to be sad about all the time. When you think about it, being happy is just forgetting all the bad things going on around you. Is everything out of your pockets? Now that all the flags are lowered, it makes me think that everyone remembers to be sad all at once. The only thing is I still feel left out. I know what I'm sad about. But I don't think it's the same as everyone else. At least it's nice to know we're all sad about something. Thank you, Rashida. Thank you for opening up like that. Thanks, guys! All right, I told you. What's up? So last week, why didn't... why didn't you say nothing? What are you talking about? Don't play me like that, bro. I ain't playing with you. Well, you didn't say nothing! What the fuck you want me to say? You know he does not want me on his team, bro. So come to fucking practice, maybe we all kick off then. Yo, are you fucking serious right now? - You're fucking pathetic, bro. - I'm pathetic? - You're fucking pathetic. - All right, bro. If Coach had done that to you, I'll be on him quick. You wouldn't say shit. I swear to God you wouldn't. - I wouldn't say shit? - Nope So, last week when Chris was telling you, - "Oh, you're ugly. - Shut the fuck up! - Really? Come on! - Why you mention... I was there! You was crying. Why are you talking about Chris, though? You all both sound like you are dating each other! You wanna suck each other's nuts or something? Yo. Come on, let's get it and shut the fuck up... Hey, hey, hey! Get off him! Everybody sprints right now! Let's move! Amber thinks she's all that. Well, she is pretty good. She ain't shit. Why are you even hanging out with her? I told you I'm not. Anyone can be on the team. Rio said I didn't even have to try out. Well, she said Tracy, Kylie and Brooklyn got caught yesterday. I thought you weren't hanging out with her? I'm not. She just told me. How'd she tell you if you two weren't hanging out? I can't talk right now? You can't talk to her and tell me you're not talking to her. You could have just asked me to practice with you. He thought that I was too much for him and he couldn't deal with me. And instead of telling me, "Hey, I don't want you to be my girl anymore," he just continued to, you know, be around me, kiss me and with all that shit. But then after a while, I was like, "Okay. Clearly, you made up your mind. You don't want anything, so why are we still doing it?" You don't know me. Who sits next to you in World History? And when you tell a story to the class, I'm the only girl you don't look at. I'm the girl that spilled her lunch tray in the cafeteria last week and was so mortified, I could have died right there. I could have sunk into the floor and never seen another day. But lucky for me... Thank you. And now, here is Kayla. You don't know me. You don't know me. I'm the girl who sits next to you in World History. And when you tell a story to the class, I'm the only girl you don't look at. I'm the girl who spilled her lunch tray in the cafeteria last week and was so mortified, I could have died right there. I could have sunk into the floor and never seen another day. But lucky for me, I'm so invisible you didn't even look my way, even when my Snapple bottle hit the floor with a loud BAM! And Mrs. B had to help me clean it up. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you do know me. Maybe you know me better than I know myself. You think I'm a sheep. You've heard me bah, haven't you? Bahhhhh. Bahhhh. Or maybe I'm a wolf. A wolf you've mistaken for a sheep. What if I'm a wolf? What sound does a wolf make? Grrrrrrrr. Grrrrrrowl. Or maybe I'm a bug. A little creepy, crawly little bug you just wanna squish under your shoe. Or maybe I'm looking down on you. Laughing at you. Laughing at how you look at yourself in the mirror 10, 15, 20 times making that stupid face, brushing and slicking your hair back just to return to Mr. Brace's class to sit at your desk to watch the white spit form in the corner of his mouth. No one's watching you. No one cares about you more than you care about you. But maybe that's good. Maybe it's good to care about yourself so much that you take a selfie every single day just to see which part of your face looks good on a bus ride home. What are you thinking now? Do you hate me? Are you leaning over to your very best friend who just yesterday you said had a big fat nose and no boy is ever going to like her? Are you whispering to her that you hope I kill myself? If you tell me you hate me, maybe I won't ever speak again. If you tell me I'm ugly, I'll skip school for three days with a really bad cough. My mom will write a note. Thank you for listening to what I wanna say. It's not really like you have a choice, you have to be here. Unless, you're upstairs working on the light board, making out with the girl you say is just a friend even though you know she's been in love with you since the fifth grade. Yo! Whoo! Well, now you know me. You really know me, don't you? You know everything there is. What do you think?
