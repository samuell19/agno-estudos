BEFORE THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN, YOUR MOTHER HAD THIS 10-MINUTE HICCUPPING FIT. COULDN'T GET RID OF 'EM. WE LAUGHED SO HARD. OH, I MISS HER. I MISS HER LIKE... LIKE NOBODY'S INVENTED THE WORD YET. I CAN'T LEAVE YOUR MOTHER. HOW LONG? THREE YEARS... FOUR MONTHS... SIXTEEN DAYS, GIVE OR TAKE. OH, LISTEN, JUST SO YOU KNOW, THAT RAP MUSIC, I HATE THE DAMN STUFF. IT'S THE ONLY MUSIC YOUR MOTHER WOULDN'T LISTEN TO. GLORIA DOESN'T SEEM TO MIND IT, SO... DO YOU... DO YOU LOVE HER? SHE LOVES ME. DON'T LET THAT GIRL GO. JUST DO WHATEVER IT TAKES. SHE... SHE WON'T... SHE WON'T TALK TO ME. SHE WON'T... COME OUT OF HER HOUSE. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. WELL, YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT. YOU KNOW, WE TRIED EVERYTHING WITH YOUR MOTHER. EVERYTHING. JOY! OH. KYLE! COME ON! GET YOUR ASS DOWNSTAIRS! COME ON! KYLE, COME ON! YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT! HA! OH, MY GOD! WHAT... ARE YOU OKAY? WHEN SHE CAME OUT, YOU WERE SLEEPING. WE PANICKED! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WE'VE GOT HER TIED UP REALLY NICE! YES! AND I AM UNTYING HER! YEAH, BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CHOICE NOW. SHE HAS TO LISTEN TO WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. YES, AND THAT ALL MAKES SENSE... UH-HUH. ...UNTIL YOU BRING IN THE WHOLE PART THAT IT'S A CRIMETHING! OUT! I'M SORRY, JOY. I'M SORRY. ALL RIGHT, GO, GO, GO. WE'RE LEAVING, WE'RE LEAVING.

Y-YOU WROTE THE CLASSIEST, SASSIEST OBIT THAT I-I'VE EVER READ, AND I DON'T WANT IT TO BE PUBLISHED FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. WELL, I DON'T HAVE LONG, KYLE. HAVE YOU BEEN PAYING ANY ATTENTION? I KNOW YOU'RE NOT DYING. THE DOCTORS, THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING PHYSICALLY WRONG WITH YOU. MENTALLY COULD BE A WHOLE OTHER STORY AT THIS POINT. YOU'RE CRAZY. I'MCRAZY? YES, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. PLEASE, PLEASE, ENLIGHTEN ME. ALL RIGHT. THAT MRI, IT DIDN'T EVEN SHOW A CRACKED TOENAIL. AND THAT'S A BAD THING...? YES, BECAUSE IF I'M NOT... DYING OF A DISEASE, IT MEANS THAT I'M DYING OF SOMETHING UNEXPECTED, SOMETHING THAT I DON'T SEE COMING! BUT WHY DO YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE DYINGAT ALL? WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOIN'? SHH! BECAUSE HE'S NEVER WRONG. WHO IS... WHO IS NEVER WRONG? WHO IS NEVER WRONG? WHO? CAESAR, OKAY? CAESAR? CAESAR THE CAT? HE'S PSYCHIC. THE CAT? YES. A PSYCHIC CAT TOLD YOU YOU WERE GOING TO DIE. YES.

I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU BELIEVE THIS! GIVE ME ONE REASON WHY I SHOULDN'T. I'M GOING TO BED NOW! FOREVER! JOY. JOY! JOY. J-JOY! JOY! KYLE, BABY. I ONCE KNEW THIS GIRL WHO HAD A PSYCHIC TWAT. ANY GUY WHO GOT CLOSE, SHE KNEW IF HE HAD AN STD OR NOT. I THINK WHAT GLORIA IS TRYING TO SAY IS THAT MAYBE IT ISN'T IMPOSSIBLE THAT THIS CAT HAS PSYCHIC ABILITIES. EXACTLY. YOU GOTTA PROVE TO HER SHE'S CRAZY, MAN! I MEAN, NO CAT PEE EVER KILLED ANYBODY! I DON'T THINK IT'S THE PEE PER SE, MARSH. SHOW HER YOU LOVE HER. SHOWER HER WITH ROMANCE. I KNOW SOME HOT STRIP-O-GRAMS. THROW HER A LIVING FUNERAL. I WAS PLANNING ONE ONE FOR YOUR MOM, BUT SHE PASSED BEFORE WE GOT TO DO IT. NO, I WANT THEBEST CHAIRS YOU GOT. WHAT, DO I SOUND LIKE A CHEAPWAD? YEAH, WELL, YOU SOUND LIKE A DICKWAD. UH, THANKS, GLORIA. I BEEN THROUGH ALL OF 'EM. I THINK I'M GONNA GO WITH THIS ONE. OH, I LIKE IT, BUT IS IT BIG ENOUGH? OKAY, IT'S A SHORT SPEECH, NOT A NOVEL. NO NEPOTISTIC SUGARCOATING, RIGHT? IF SHE DOESN'T LOVE THIS, SHE'S DEFINITELY DERANGED. KEEP THE ENGINE RUNNING. LITTLE BUGGER'S BLADDER WILL BE SO FULL, HE'LL BE PEEING EVERYWHERE, ON EVERYONE, WITH ANY LUCK. SHE'LL SEE HER THEORY DISINTEGRATE INTO THIN AIR. I'LL DO MY DAMNDEST TO MAKE SURE HE PEES ON ME, MAN.

UH, I-I-I'VE BEEN PENNING HER OBITUARY FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AS PART OF MY NEW BOOK, BUT I-IT'S BECOME APPARENT THAT THIS... ODE TO MY JOY... HAS BEEN PREDETERMINED TO COME TO LIFE IN... IN THIS MOMENT. THIS IS GREAT. YOU'RE DOING IT. This is ridiculous! YOU'RE DOING IT! YOU'RE DOING IT, BOZO! TODAY WE MOURN THE PASSING OF OUR BELOVED JOY HELENA BAILEY, 29. SHE WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR HER GENEROSITY TO THE HOMELESS, KINDNESS TO SENIORS AND DEAD BIRDS, OVERCOMING HER FEROCIOUS FEAR OF CLOWNS, AND LEAVING HER MARK ON THE WORLD IN... TRULY INNOVATIVE WAYS. SHE IS SURVIVED BY THE BOY-NEXT-DOOR-GONE-WRONG, WHO... CONTINUE. UM... UH, THE BOY-NEXT-DOOR- GONE-WRONG, WHO... YOU... YOU MAKE ME FEEL THE MOST TERRIFYING HAPPINESS THAT I'VE EVER KNOWN.
