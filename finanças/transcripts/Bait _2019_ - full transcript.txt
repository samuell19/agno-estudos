Evenin', Mrs Peters. - Evenin', Martin. - Lovely day. Yeah, lovely. Feel like autumn's comin', don't it? Should have a fish or two for you in the mornin'. Proper job. See you later, Dad. How was the drive? Awful. Seven hours. Same. Never mind. We're here now. Yeah. Oi! - Can I borrow it? - No! - Can I hire it? - No! I'll buy one. - You're not using them. - Give it 'ere. Go play on the beach. Alright? Hi. When'd you get down? Just now. You out tonight? Maybe. See you later, then. Yew. Yew, wasson? Nothin' much. Gettin' many? Not enough. It's a very difficult industry and remember the margins here are... ...are because of the supermarkets... Yew. Right bud? Need any help? - Nothin' doin'. - No? Soon. Ain't you got better things to be doing on a Friday night? Skint. Alright, boy? - Alright, Dad? - Wasson? Nothin'. D'you wanna come out with me tomorrow? Could do with the help. Nah, you're alright. - Need the money, don't you? - Not that much, he don't. You got something to say, Martin? Just said it, brother. What about you? I'm fishing. Offer's always open. You come back whenever you want. No thanks. See you later, then. Back for tea? Maybe. - Neil. - Yeah? Wanna haul the net with me 'morra? Yeah. - I'll give you a knock about six. - Cool. Just the man! I'm going to have to ask you again not to leave your truck outside. It is private parking. And people might bump it. Don't worry 'bout that, she's pretty sturdy. Can I stay in the net loft? Can I? It's booked. Not until tomorrow. The cleaner's been. - So? - Yeah, I'll move it. I'm going home now, anyways. Hi. - Where are you off? - Out. Thanks. Katie? - Yeah? - Don't be back too late. Okay! Buddin' fisherman, y'got 'ere. And the pound going up would benefit farmers. One person said to me, "I don't think it'll make that much... They're probably mine. ...I do my shopping and pay my bills every week - so it doesn't make much difference. - I doubt it. I've lost enough of 'em. I bought them online. A question I put to a man... Didn't like the pantry, then? Needed modernising. Nice porthole, though. It was the response from the director of the Food and Drink Federation, who represents some of... Very nautical. You didn't have to sell us this house. Didn't we? Cheers. - When'd you get down? - Last week. Any parties? Yeah, a few. Mornin'. Alright, Mar? Good night? Yeah. Yew. Wasson? Boy 'ere? Didn't come home. I went in the house. - What house? - The old house. What's it like? Been modernised. All bleddy ropes and chains, though, y'know? Look a bit like a sex dungeon. Hm. ...people are estimated by the government to be victims - of forced labour... - They got a porthole. Wakey, wakey! Hands off snakey! Fuck off! Fuck off! See you on the beach. So, then what I understand from you is that Dr Fox's... ...effectively grant ministers the power to write law behind parliament's back. Isn't that just a coded way of saying... Piss off, Hugo. Well, the bill was published just 24 hours after the deadline... Don't forget that Dr Fox wasn't interested in what businesses trade unions and other affected parties had to say on the subject. Here she is. Dirty stop out! So, a wide-ranging market access agreement with the US requires a bonfire of those... You do need to let us know if you're not coming home, darling. Sorry. ...does not want to give parliament any means of obstruction. Exactly, negotiations will be tough and Britain, as the junior party, will be forced into some ugly compromises. Arguments in Westminster about the desirability of importing chlorine-washed American chicken is that it's an early sign of things to come. If we think back to the referendum we remember the economists saying there will be clear-cut advantages to leaving the EU. We would regain control over fishing rights around our coasts... Bass? How many you got? - Four. - Could do with more. All I got. How much? Thirty quid. Cheers. Got yourself a helper, then? Crew. You haven't got a boat, Martin. - Will have soon. - Yeah, at your prices! See you dreckly, Liz. This way. Sorry about the parking. That's okay. But if you park in the car park for now, we'll reimburse you. Thank you. Here we are! It's an old fisherman's net loft. This looks lovely! It was totally derelict when we bought it. Really? Oh, wow! There's some milk, some local cheese and a bottle of fizz in there for you. And a homemade cream tea. Thank you. Shall I leave these here? - Yeah, they're yours now. - Yeah? Yeah, you might wanna wear 'em in the pub, pull more posh birds. Shut up! Mornin', Jacques! Am I done? Yeah. Cool. Two sea bass? Thank you. Bon app√©tit. How's Wenna gettin' on, then? Alright, Mar? Behavin' yerself, bird? Yeah, man. Stayin' out of trouble? Yeah, man. Check that out. Ell up. - Know who that is? - Yeah. He's wasting his time with her. - Yeah? - Yeah. Ow's she gonna suck his dick with that plum in 'er mouth? Wenna! Can't understand a bleddy word she says, neither. There's one over there, right, who's so fuckin' posh I honestly thought he was speaking German. Scuse me, are you serving? Glasses. Ya, ya, ya, ya! Shit pub anyways, innit? Wenna! Can't even get on the pool table. I'm warning you! If only we had something to cook on the fire. Hey, Hugo? Piss off. I'm gonna go. Kay. Wasson? Nothin' much. New net? Another net. More money in lobsters. With what boat? Shoot a pot in the old ring bolt. Alright, Mar? Boss lady around, is she? Upstairs. Liz? Down in a sec! I'll have a shot. - No. - Go on, I'm playing next anyway. There's money down, squirt. Don't matter, it's winner stays on. - No it isn't. - Tis. - Pot anything? - No. Go away. Alright? Want some lobster? Maybe. How many you got? None yet. Couple of days, though. You got yourself a boat? Nope. Shootin' a pot down the gully. One pot? Tis a start. Oh, Martin. Oi, what you doin'? Why don't you just go back working with Steven for a bit? No way. - Oi. - Earn a bit of proper money. Oi! - What? - I got bleddy principles. I'm playin' you now. No, I'm going to give him one more chance. Oh, come on, Martin. Nah, it's winner stays on. - Usin' father's boat to take anglers out? - Look. 'Ee'd be spinnin' in his grave and you know it. - Shut up. - You could be a bit more supportive, Martin. - Supportive? - You can play in a minute. - Yeah. - Supportive of 'im? - Come on, play fair. Winner stays on. - It's not your turn. He lost his wife, for God's sake! - You've been on here ages. - Yeah. Because we had money down. - Don't work like that. - Yes it does. - He's got a boy to bring up on his own. - I'm playing you. - He idn' doin' that very well either, is he? - You're not! - I am! - D'you think 'e gives a shit how he earns his money?! - Well, he fuckin' should do. - I'm warning you. Fuck off, dickhead. Will you lot shut the fuck up? Now you do it! Take it off, now. We can't. - It's the parking company. - You own the street! - You have to phone the clamping company. - I'll get the number for you. I don't want the fuckin' number. D'you want me to bust it off? If you want to. No! It's not something we can get involved with. You own the bleddy street. You can't just park there all day. It's fine you picking stuff up and dropping stuff off... I work at the harbour. I'm a bleddy fisherman! Are you? Where's your boat? Parking needs to be controlled. - There's usually room in the car park. - Why can't they park in the car park? Because they pay to be able to park outside. Never been no issue til you party come along. Now all of a sudden... - Not really sudden... - It is all of a sudden. - Y'only been 'ere five minutes. - Martin. I'm going to end this conversation now. We're sorry, Martin, but losing your temper isn't going to help. I haven't lost me temper yet. Okay, Martin. Keep it. Sorry? Bugger idn' hardly worth anything anyhow. Okay. It's up to you. I'm just tryin' to earn a living, you know? So are we. Scuse me. - What you doing, Mar? - Nothin'. You been clamped? I think so, yeah. Who done that? Who do you think? Pricks. What you doing? Kicked out the pub. - What for? - Dunno. - You work there. - I know. - Put up a fight, did yer? - Nah, shit pub, anyways. I got the last laugh, anyhow. What are you doing, Martin? It's between me and the clamping company. Why don't you just fuck off? Wenna. Wouldn't it be more sensible if you just paid the fine? And wouldn't it be better if you just fucked off? Wenna, shut up! - Do you want me to call the police? Do you want me to get you a medal? That's enough. Leave it, Tim. It's alright, Tim, we're going. - We don't have to go, Mar. - I know, love. But we are. For God's sake! Come here. Get in! Oh! I'm fine. Wenna! Excuse me! Scuse me! Do you know what time it is? It's not even seven o'clock! You've just woken us up! This is supposed to be a relaxing break! What's going on? Look! Scuse me! E's gotta go to work, what do you want him to do? Well, do it later! Shouldn't be making this kind of noise til at least eight o'clock. I think it's actually illegal. You gonna change the tides for 'im? What? Do they really have to do that now? I'm afraid they do. They're fishermen. It's a fishing village. You're actually making more noise than they are. Make sure you leave some fish for the rest of us. Cheers. What about these lobsters? Morra. We'll haul the pot tonight. Back in a minute. Yew! Alright, Mar? Let you out then, did they? Yeah. Charge yer? Nope, not yet. Right, well, keep your bleddy head down from now on. Yeah, man.
