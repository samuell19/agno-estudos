1871 then? No, Father was born in 1872. How much older than Mum? Eight years. Then he is 69. So, Mum was born in...? The year of Dragon. Eight years since we last gathered. For Father's 61st Birthday. You were small then. You wore a sky-blue hair ribbon. You still remember it? You looked nice wearing it. I wished I'd been old enough to wear one. You're old enough to get married now. And Mum's 61 now. Right. I never thought you would marry my brother. I didn't know you had a brother, either. Did you want to? Maybe not. Hello! Hello, nice to meet you! Ryokichi? He is here. I stopped off on the way. How are you? Good, thank you. I like your sash. A gift from my husband's co-worker. Yours? From Mum, she wore it when she was 22 or 23. She wore such subdued sashes when young? The photographer is here? What about Shojiro? He often fails, Dad does not trust him. So, we don't consider him. Everyone is here? Yes, you are the last. I will go to congratulate Mother. Mitsuko? She is with Mother. In the living room. Good afternoon. Hello. It's been a while. You look well. What have you done? We went home. Nowhere to go? What happened then? I made a mistake. That was the right answer, my sister is 3 years younger than me. I wrote: My sister is 3 years old and younger than me. You did? That was wrong. Grandpa, will the teacher pass me? I doubt it. Grandma? I wonder. Hello. Hello. It has been a long time, father. Yes. You look well. Thanks. Happy birthday, Mum! Thanks, thank you for your gift. I am wearing it now. It's like yours. Isn't it too red? I turned 61 years old. That means, I returned to babyhood. Another gift. Really? Thanks. This is for Dad. For me? Thanks. Come here to your aunt. Everyone is here. Come to the garden. Have you called taxis? Yes, three. Let's take pictures and eat. Will you come? I will. Then, let's go! Let's go! Dad! Mum! Here! Ayako? Are we all here? Really? Where is Shojiro? Call him? I will go. Shojiro! What are you doing? We are all ready. Really? Hurry! Change your clothes. This is okay. Wear a suit. They are all in the garden. Which tie? Any tie will do. Be quick. We are going out too. We will eat lunch together, we called a taxi. You look lovely. Hurry! I praised you. Uncle! What's keeping you? Hurry, grandpa is mad. Don't scare me. Were you asleep? No! You sleep too much, hurry up. Act quickly! Nope! Hurry, or I will kill you. Coming. Shojiro? He is coming. He never changes. Here he comes. Run! Hurry! Sorry! You stand there. Everyone is ready? Sorry to keep you waiting! Will you move to the left? A bit more. Here we go, move a little more. Don't laugh! Here we go! Thank you! Let's go over there. Have my parents come home? Yes! Shojiro? He came home but went out again. Where? I don't know. I'm back. Right. Sorry to be late, I went to see Tokiko. Did you come straight home? Mother and I had some tea. We walked to Hibiya Park. The flowers were lovely. We heard music at the hall. How nice, you two alone, after such a long time. Yes, when was it we went to view flowers together? Two years after the Great Earthquake. The 1923 quake? Years ago. More than ten years ago. So many years? I was happy today. My entire family came. I'm glad I've lived this long. The food was delicious, wasn't it? What food? With white sauce. You asked for more. That was really good. Want something to eat? Shall I have an apple pie? Please do, change first. Excuse me! I feel fine, my face still feels hot. You drink too much. The sake was tasty, listen. Old people have joy in their own way, right? Ryokichi is in high school by now. Life is fun. You will soon have more grandchildren. My glasses... I feel so good, I am drunk. Give me some water. A wet towel too. Yes, thanks! Anybody? Please give me a glass of water and towel. What's the matter? What's the matter? I'm a bit sore. Are you alright? Want some water? It's nothing serious. Don't bother! Will you loosen my sash for me? Are you all right? Someone help! Setsuko! Make his bed. Dad is ill. What happened? Call the doctor. Hurry, bring some ice. Hello? Yes, they are here. Wait, hello? A phone call from your parents' house. They said your father is ill, and ask you to come right away. What happened? They hung up? Yes, it sounded urgent. Call a taxi. It's so sudden, isn't it? He was so active today. Will you phone them to make sure? Hello? What did the doctor say? That's bad. Where's Shojiro? He is not home? Did you look for him? He is hopeless! How is father? I will come now. Be strong, Setsuko. I am going out. My clothes. That one? The one I wore earlier today. That sash too. Give me that. I think I need one more. I hope I won't. Prepare one more outfit. Tell Ryokichi to stay home. A phone call from your parents' house. Your father is ill. They want you to come right away. When? Now. They want us? What's happened? What did they say? It sounded serious. Shall we go now? Let's get inside first. Make strong coffee. Maybe we have to sit up all night. Drink more coffee. Am I tired? Will he be all right? He is already 69. A Chinese philosopher said a man understands life at fifty, and enjoys life at seventy. It's so upsetting. It came so suddenly. It's sake, right? I have told you so many times. Do something. Thanks for everything. You must be tired, why not rest? Lie down for awhile. I am fine. You still have a long way to go. Take care. About the schedule... The funeral will be held on this day. Mr. Hatakeyama will preside. That day? The temple priest said it's the best day. And death notices... we have asked five newspapers. That, and that... And also this. Have you written this? Yes, it will be published tomorrow. Thanks, you take a rest too. You must be very tired and sad. I am fine. Are you tired? No. Too sudden. I cannot accept it. Take care. Welcome back. I am back. Don't cry. Don't spill any more tears. Don't cry. It's so sudden. Where are you? In Osaka. I saw today's paper. When? 7:36 AM. What is the reason? Heart disease. Painful? Very. Sake killed him, he drank too much. How is Mum? Fine? I will go to pray for Father. Don't cry, it's over. Enough. Uncle. I have taken a day off. Your grandfather has passed away? I have not yet seen him. Right. I sat so long my legs hurt. Grandma's nose was red. Right. We will play later. I am back. Where were you? In Osaka. Carefree man! I never thought this would happen. You should tell me where you have gone. We looked for you. I'm very sorry. I wanted to fish suddenly. You can't go fishing at that time. I don't. The sea was tough. I quit and came home. Did he leave his last words? No! Didn't he complain about me? Maybe he was in too much pain to do so. I see. What's this? Tea leaves to keep me awake. Please give me some. You have lost some weight. Go to sleep. I am fine. Really? Are you okay? I slept during the day. Where is mother? We made her go to bed. Good. It would be trouble if she gets sick too. Go to sleep, let's take turns to sleep. Is there any food? Hungry. Make a rice ball for me. A big one. Tomorrow is another day. I am back, mother. You are back? Sorry! I didn't expect to be. I was the source of his worries. Yet I wasn't here when he died. After all, I haven't given him anything. I might have, if he lived longer. I regret it now. I'm sorry. Among these things, Dad's firm has been close to bankruptcy. He'd drawn notes for huge sums for it. We were surprised. He didn't draw them recently. He had been postponing their due date. We are morally responsible for their payment. We can't pay the entire amount. But we must pay at least half. He was very powerful in the economic world. But his fame caused this disaster. Dad was a man with a pure heart and clean hands. He always was. Now, we must be satisfied. I spoke to Suzuki too. We will sell everything, this house, land... To pay his note. I am sorry to make you come for this bad news. What do you think about it? No matter how, we have no choice. How is sister? We have no choice. Your comment? We have no choice. Shojiro. I agree. What about mother and Setsuko? They can move here. Can't they stay till Setsuko gets married. The sooner the better, right. That house? It's really old, only the land is worth anything. And you? Don't worry about me. Enough? Do you think I can manage? Yes, if we do it properly. Here's a list of these paintings and curios. Some of them are quite valuable. No 36, Flowers and birds in Autumn. Shen-Nan-Pin. Yes, by Shen-Nan-Pin. No 37, Waterfall Viewing. Who? An ancient Chinese poet. No 38, Mt Fuji. Hoitsu Sakai. No 40, Snow Over Pines. No 43, Plate with Narcissus Motifs. A phone call for Mr. Shojiro. Excuse me. 862 items, some junks is included. Any tea ceremony bowls? I want one. Hello? Fine, I am coming. I will be right there. I feel really sorry. He was a good customer. Too sudden. How old was he? He was not too old. But he was not young anymore. It's sake's fault. Don't drink too much. I won't. Drink some. No thanks, enjoy yourself. More sake. You were not there? When? When your Dad passed away? I was. Liar. You were fishing at Osaka. Got some? Nonsense! We all know. Do you think it is too sudden? Of course. He was a good father. He was scary too. I don't think so. Sure, and he died so abruptly. He pitched the first ball at a baseball game. His ball bounced twice on the ground. I was surprised. He'd practised how to pitch. He was not good at sports. But he was a good archer. Yes, he practised everyday. I got up early to help him. He would be in a good mood at such times. You sold his books, right? The one you brought here. Yes! I called a secondhand bookshop. They can sell a good price. Where did the money go? We spent it on drinking. You stole his telescope too, didn't you? The long one. Enough! That wristwatch. Stop it, enough! He has already passed away. He didn't know... I doubt. He knew it but he did not tell you. It was useless to tell me. I don't agree. He was a good father. Yes. Father is such a nice man. I hope he can live longer. Take care of yourself. If you're dead, you cannot drink anymore. Can I live until 70? You can. Why? They say, "Bad boys live long". Then I will be a bad boy. You're already bad. Am I? Why? What are you doing? I'm fine. Strange, right? I wasn't sad when he died. But now I remember those trivial things. Father and I ate here. In this room. He sat here, and I sat there. At this hour, too. The sunlight like this. This sake cup too. There was a fly. It landed on his ear. He shooed it away, but it soon came back. Men cry at odd times. Come to think of it, bad sons cry easily, right? I'll go there. Where? Tianjin in China. I would like to get a job there. Are you sure? I have been thinking for so long, I want to find a job. I don't have a house. Any work will do. I just want to work. I want to start over. Not because father died, it's been my wish. Decided? Almost. When will you go? As soon as it's decided. So, you will go? We are going to lose you. A good man. Eat what you can't eat there. Let's order more sake. Good idea. This is very valuable. It really is. What do you think? Is No 627 here? No 627. Here it is, it's in a box. Show me. Here it is. This is the one. It's very good. I must pack. Please see to this. Alright. Excuse me. Enough? Thanks. Finished? Why not take this coat too? No thanks. It's cold there. I don't think it's that cold. That is new. Really? If you insist. Thanks. How about your ticket? I have bought it. The other day I went to Osaka. I will pass there and go as far as Tianjin. Life's unpredictable. Take care! Weather is unsteady there. Don't worry. Drink only boiled water. He is not a child anymore, mother. Take good care of yourself. You take care of yourself, too. We will not meet for a while. When can we meet next? Maybe we will get together only after I die. Nonsense. Don't talk like that. You will live long and see more happy times. You think so? Of course you will. Right? You must. Tianjin is not so far. Take a plane. The trip is much shorter than a domestic train ride. Really? Sure, don't worry. Take a bath. Please go. Don't forget anything. Setsuko, please help him. Give me that. You'd better forget that marriage proposal. I feel sorry for you. Please give up. He cancelled it just because Dad died. I am glad he did. I don't want you to marry such a heartless man. Forget it. Mum is very worried. I will find a better man for you. One who has a good build and is kind. But he's not very handsome. A guy like me. Right, keep this smile. Don't worry. I will write to you from China, you too. Tell me everything. After you move in with Soichiro you will have lots of inconveniences. You have to be patient. Be nice to mother. I will work hard this time. I really will, you try hard too. Take good care of mother. I think she will not get used to this. You are crying again. I can't leave with this. Take good care of Mum. Sure, don't worry. Will they really come? Yes, there is no better method to care for them. Where will mother and Setsuko stay? Upstairs. How about me? Downstairs. Where is my luggage? Leave it upstairs. No. Then, bring them downstairs. Chizuko's house is bigger. Maybe. I am the eldest son. It may be inconvenient, but please put up with it. Not just me, they may find it crowded too. Setsuko has brought many things. And the maid. They will bring that hill myna bird. Pull that part. What did sister say? Has she complained? I have made a big mistake. The flowers are too beautiful I picked one. You shouldn't! Kazuko loves them so much. I didn't know it then. They are special species. They are so lovely. I was ignorant. That part. The madam wants you. Mother, here is the needle. Going out? Yes, you know Tanimoto, don't you? She is in town now. I invited her here this evening. Will you go out with mother? Staying here, she will only be annoyed. Stay out till 7 or 8. How about it? I am sorry to make you do it. You will go to Ginza, right? Will you do me a favour? Have some cake and fruit delivered. What type? I will bring some. And sandwiches. Sandwiches? Shall I make them myself? Don't bother. Order them, for 6 people. Excuse me! Sorry to bother you! It's alright. Don't give any to Mitsuko, all right? Never do that. Tell mother not to, either. Sweets give her the trots. I will go, see you later. Clean the place and water the flowers. Will you take the bird upstairs? I don't want it to bother us. I will do it. Where shall we go? Let me think. Where? Hibiya Park. How about Ueno Zoo? You go alone, enjoy yourself. Don't worry about me! I think I will go to see Chizuko. I haven't seen her for a while. You go to Ginza. Then we will go separately. Have a good time. I will go to see Tokiko. Good idea, be careful on the way. You too! Shall I give you some? Yes, please. Sister didn't give me money. Thank you! Take care! Hello! Welcome. Such a long time. Where is Madame? She went out for a tea ceremony lesson. Oh! She has a lesson every day. Oh, I remember. Shall I phone her? No, everyone's fine? Grandma. Hello. Hello, you are alone. No need to go to school? No, come to my room. I have something to show you. Let's go. You have grown, haven't you? The tallest in your class? Take a look. Can you see? Nice, huh? Something messy. Guess what? Tell me. How should I know that? It's simple. My snot. Looks great, huh? Want to see more? No thanks. What happened at your school? It's great! Why stay home? I'm skipping it. Don't tell Mum. Why? I had a fight yesterday. What happened? They fooled me. They will get back at me. Is that the only reason? You should go to school. Who's there? Get out. Here, have some tea. Shut the door. Ryokichi... Don't skip school just like that. Will you tell Mum? You'll do it again? Will you tell her? Let us make a deal. Don't do this again. Apologise to your teachers later, alright? You sure? Don't tell Mum, okay? Don't worry, I promise you. I am going to have my lunch. I will give you half. Take this. I will eat first. Be careful. How to use the microscope? Again? Don't. You eat first, I will eat that. Can you stay longer? Let's play together. Mum will be home late. I am going to visit your grandpa's grave. I'll come with you. Really? He must be happy. He loves you. Let's go together quickly. Hurry. Who makes your lunch every morning? The maid. Delicious? Good! Have some tea. How are you? Sorry to make you come. Busy? It's okay, how is your mother? Fine, thanks. It's been a long time. Mother sends her regards. What do you do every day? Me? Various things. Housework, I clean the house and cook. I mended the quilts today. You do that, too? Yes. I am quite busy. Look! I took a day off today. You do such things? Poor girl. Why? Well... I can't stay the innocent girl forever. Impressed? Yes, very much. Really? Is your work hard? Can I do it, too? Of course. Then let me do it. Why? I feel like it, that's all. I wonder if I can do it. Don't laugh, I am serious. How are you recently? How is your mum? Are they getting along well? Can you tell? Are they? No. I thought so. I am sorry to talk this way. No one is to blame. It's just... they are too different in many ways. I know. What should I do at such a time? I keep feeling sorry for both of them. And you? I am fine. So I will work and live with Mother. I know, but you should think deeply. You and I are very different. My father's a mere employee, while... yours was an employer. You and I... Born under different circumstances. Do you think you can live like me? Is it wrong? I am asking if you have the courage. Great courage. I have courage. You sure? Don't you think it will only worry your mother? She will understand, but... You'd better consider it well. I will. Sorry, I talk too much. I feel sorry for your mother. Shall we eat? I will pay. Let me treat you. I have money. Mother gave me some on the street. I was ashamed. Ashamed? Just for that? We're different there. Understand? What'll it be? Something cheap that tastes good. And big, right? That's it. How about this? Which one, then? It's all right, isn't it? No. Tokyo is the best. Really? I like it there. I wish I could live there. We can see mountains, and the sea. Misuko? She went to bed. The food is better there, too. Did she go to bed? Yes. Bright girl. The food there is better. Some Tokyo restaurants serve similar food. But it's not so good. Welcome back. I am back. Are the guests still here? Has mother come home? Where is she? At the kitchen. I am back. I am late, when did you get back? Two hours ago. I thought the guests had gone. So I hurried. I took a walk with Tokiko. She sends her regards. That's nice of her. What about you? Chizuko was out. Ryokichi and I visited Father's grave. He carried flowers. Then he said, "Don't die, grandma". He's nice. Take a shower. How about you? After Kazuko does. Why not bathe first? I will do it later. You are sleepy, aren't you? Are they leaving? It's so late. Kazuko is in a good mood. I can tell by how she calls the maid. The maid thinks so. They are leaving? No, they want some tea. The water's boiling? These cups? She called you. How's sister? Fine? Leaving so soon? Why not stay longer? Will you be in town long? Yes, we will meet again. The tea... Right away. Forget it. Call the taxi. Never mind. Call the taxi. No thanks. No need now. Hope you can stay a little longer. We will meet again soon. No need, they have left. Have some? No, thanks. Your husband? He's on a trip. I will phone you around Friday. Sorry to stay long. Good night. You are back! The bath's ready? Have you bathed? Not yet. And you? Not yet. Why not, it is very late. We didn't feel like it. Get my clothes ready. We will go to bed first. Good night! Look at this! They didn't like it? It cost a lot. Tokiko would be mad at this. The way she ate. Why bother buying so many? You be careful! Bad girl! Delicious! I am tired. Massage for you? No need. Tomorrow, I will wash clothes, shampoo, and write to Shojiro. Let's go to sleep. Good night! I saw boiled fish in Ginza, seems delicious. I want to send some to Shojiro. But I have no money. I don't have any either. What a pity. I spent the money eating with Tokiko. You are nice. Can you go to sleep? Shall I tell Kazuko to stop? Never mind. But you are tired. The maids must get up early. What will you do? I will ask her to stop. Don't bother! No problem. Do as you like, but tell her politely. Can you stop playing the piano? Why, is it noisy? Mother can't sleep. Thanks. I don't mind. Good night. Setsuko! We must be more considerate of each other. This time I might have been wrong. Sometimes I have to swallow my complaints because... we live in the same house. When the guest came this morning, you should have greeted them. We thought it would disturb them. Why? Didn't you tell us to stay out? Yes, I did. Then... If you had stayed out, it's all right. But when you came back you should have greeted them. And Tanimoto was one of the guests. Mother knows her, doesn't she? No one likes to admit she is wrong. They soon learn what is wrong with other people. But they must bear it for each other's sake. Right? Do you understand? Understand? Good night. They have trouble? Neither of them is wrong. It happens because they must live together in that house. Maybe. They are in a bad mood sometimes. Moving may be a good diversion for mother. Fine, I will let them stay here. Really? Thank you. I hope Ryokichi studies hard... even with his Grandmother here, but with her around he might not obey me. I will warn them about it. All right. After staying here, they might move to Ayako's. Will the maid come, too? Yes, they will bring lots of things. And the bird, too. Want to work? What about a clerk? What kind of job do you want? Don't, your friend may be working. But you are different. Don't think so casually. It is not only your concern. Please consider us! Your father would be disgraced. What will the others think if you go out to work? Dad died, we may not be well off. But you have no need to work. Our situation is not that worse. Don't think too much. Your wedding is coming. Give up this stupid idea. Understand? Don't think about it again! Suppose I went shopping and found you as the clerk. I will be ashamed. Are you sure? Anyone around? Go and clean upstairs. Hey! Where are my clothes? Please prepare for me. And a coat. Going out? Did my son go to school yesterday? Every day? Of course. But his teacher wants to meet me. He hasn't been to school. The teacher said he is often absent. I wonder what happened. Any ideas? Come to think of it. One day, you were out and he was home. I asked him why he wasn't at school. He said he had fought with a friend of his. When was it? When I was still living with Soichiro. Why didn't you tell me? I should have. I'm sorry. This might not have happened. I suppose so. I should've told you. It's too late for that. I am sorry. It's no use apologising. But I made a promise with him then. Promise for what? Not to tell anybody if he behaves himself. It is unreasonable. You kept this secret from me? You should tell me everything. You didn't scold him? Yes, I did. It didn't work. He did it again. A promise with a little child? Were you serious? You should know about children. You raised many on your own. I was thoughtless. Be more careful! Tell me everything about him. I want to raise him my way. But you are only spoiling him. You are right. I was wrong, I am sorry and I will be careful. Just stay away from my son. Mrs. Toda and Miss Setsuko have arrived. Show them in. Hello, Ayako. How are you, mother? Glad to see you. Sorry, I have been going out when you came. You should have phoned me before. Yes, sorry. I don't mind being a little bit late. How are you, Setsuko? Ayako, can you do me a favour? What's the matter? About us. We would like to move to the villa in Kugenuma. Why? No special reason. It is empty now. What do you think? We should live here, but... Sister and Brother agreed. And we have decided. You have decided? Why go to that place? We have room here. Thanks. You think you can do it? I will try. It is inconvenient. Really, I just think you'd love to stay here. Not really far away, you can visit us. It is near the sea. You will like it. When will you go? As soon as possible. We will meet again before you go. Then we leave first. Stay awhile. Why don't you order lunch? Take care! Sorry that I must go now. Here. Waited long? A little. Sorry. I have a guest. Who? Mother and Sis. For what? Guess? It's our turn now? No, they will move to the villa. Really? Should be. We are lucky, right? They skipped us. We wouldn't get on with them, and then? I said, see you again. But I feel sorry. Why? After I came here, the first thing I sewed... was a baby dress for Setsuko. Look at her. She has grown into such a lovely girl. Yes. She is really nice. When she was born, I told Mr. Toda. It's a girl. And he said, a girl again? Girl is worthless. So I said, "Babies can't be born without women". He said that he knew and laughed. Did that happen? Such a long time ago. Time flies, doesn't it? It's already been a year since Mr. Toda passed away. Yes. I feel like many years have passed. A lot of things has happened, I feel tired. Things change so quickly, don't they? Maybe. Thanks for your help! That's all right. Is there any food, I am hungry? Be nice. It is tea time. Anything will do. It is not Tokyo. Take a look. There are some cakes. I will take some. Hurry! Tokiko may come tomorrow evening. Saturday? Guess what she will wear? No idea. Just one? A dress. No, a kimono made from the cloth you gave her. My prize. It is too soon. Will Shojiro come to Father's first death ceremony? I don't know! He should come back. He may be busy. He lives far away, I just want him to be well. I hope he can come. He may not be able to come. Think so? I am glad everything went well today. The rain stopped in the morning. Glad that it didn't rain. Shojiro came, too. You never change, we were worried about you. The sea was so rough, sorry I was late. Father must be very happy. Today's sutra was long. I asked the priest to make it short. My legs are tired. Ryokichi couldn't even stand up. How is life in China? What do you mean? Do you go fishing? No, I am quite busy recently. You may take a rest. I will call you later. Why do Mother and Setsuko live at the villa? No special reason. Why don't they live with you? They have been. What has happened? They moved to Chizuko's home. Then? They stayed at my house. And? They decided to move out. I don't believe it. I decided to move. Please keep out of this, Mother. Why do you let them live in such a place? When we wanted to sell it. You said that it was worthless. It is too old. I was surprised Mother and Setsuko moved there. I thought they were happy to live with you. We had our reasons. Like what? You were not here. That's not the reason. It is the question of your sincerity. Don't tell me you think Mother's only in the way. Don't ever think I know nothing. Maybe I have trusted you too much. I should have looked after her myself. I should have decided it earlier. Children should be kind and warm to their mother. But you haven't. Even for just a year. Even when we are together today. Father would not be happy. Why didn't you ask them to move in? Mother has decided it. Why didn't you ask her to come to your place? Why? I've thought about it. Then why didn't you ask her? But... No "but", you talk without doing anything. Where is your sincerity? How rude! Who's rude? Leave! But... Leave! Ayako, come here! Sit down! You leave too! Think it over. Will you leave too? Of course. Then go! Goodbye. Give my best to Ryokichi. Soichiro, do you think I am wrong? If not, please leave. Go ahead. You'll pay for this food later. Stop crying. It taught them a lesson. It is best to bawl them out like I did. I may have ruined Father's death anniversary. But it will help them get along with each other. Father would be glad. Don't cry. Mother, Setsuko. Let's eat together. Everything is going well. Don't cry again. Eat something, there is lots of food. I'll loosen my belt. Very delicious, mother, eat some. I can't get this in China. Eat more, get fat. Hope I can stay with you. But it's a very important time for my work. I can't just leave at this moment. How about this... both of you go with me. What do you think? I am already an old woman. Age doesn't matter. Old people climb mountains and visit temples. What's wrong with you going to Tianjin? Really? Of course! No one there will care about whatever you do. Just do what you think is best. Don't mind what people say. Sticking to appearances, you can't do a thing. Why aren't you going? You can relax in China. You will feel as if the sky were higher there. Brother and sister have already apologised so you can stay in Tokyo and live with one of them. But I want you to come with me. Let's go! What do you think? I don't mind. You don't? Let's decide. It's nice there. Well, if you really don't mind. It's done. How about you? Yes. If you don't mind, let's go. It's good. It's really nice. Let's go together! It has been decided, right? This bird, it won't be ignored anymore. Listen. Can we talk? About what? What is this? Why don't you get married? I know a very nice girl. What do you think? Do you already have someone you like? Do you? No. Listen, she is a nice girl. Who? I have a friend. Pretty? Very nice and honest. I can't believe you have such a friend. Who? Tokiko. That ordinary girl? What do you think? I am too good for her. No, she is too good for you. Am I that ugly? Mother likes her. So, she is the best for you. Mother likes her? Don't mention your mother, do you love her? Not really. Don't like her? Not really. Then, what is it? I will leave it up to you, think deeply. She's not so bad. Then it's okay? It's done. Wait! It's now my turn to say something. About your marriage, leave it to me. I didn't ask too much. You can't either. A really good and strong man. A bit homely, though. Someone like me. You don't like him? There are so many men for you to choose. I will pick the best one for you. Leave it to me. Take it easy. Don't look down on me. Mum, it is Tokiko. She is here. Who? Tokiko, I will talk with her. You meet her later. No. Why? I am bashful. You are lying! I mean it! You will meet her, all right? No, I won't meet her. Let me handle it. So do as I say, all right? I am still bashful. It is not like you. Just act cheerfully as usual. Impossible, this is different. Everyone has his weakness. Even a hero. Many heroes have weaknesses. No excuses! I won't see her. Then I will bring her here. Thanks for the gift! It's alright. I hope you like it. Hello. Hello. Glad you have come. Which train? Towards Shimbashi. Crowded? She has brought a gift. Thank you. It's for your brother. Thanks! What's this? Something to go with Sake. So nice, he will like it. I'll take it to him. Where is he? He went out just now.
