- Even the sea is crying. - You're right. Ah, the mountain folks. Thank you for coming all this way today. Mother, it's Yasuko. My, Yasuko, it's you! What brings you here? Did someone tell you about today? No. I went to Kyoto when I suddenly remembered. I got details from Grandma and hurried over. Is that right? I'm so happy. Visiting us on the 7th anniversary of Kiyono's death... It's like a dream. Come join us. What do you know, it's Yasuko! Thank you for coming. I'm Shuuji. Recognize me? Of course. You've grown so well! Come on, Yasuko. Mom, Yasuko's come all the way from Tokyo. It's been a long time. Thank you for coming. We were thinking about you, too. You look like you've been doing well. I'm very happy for you. You came without anyone even contacting you. I bet Kiyono's spirit called for you! Right, Mom? Don't you think so? - She's here from Tokyo. - Kiyono called her here! It has to be Kiyono. She gathered everyone she wanted to see. You're right. Seven years ago, One woman loved one man, And took her own life in this sea. At the time, people spread all sorts of rumors about her death, And caused pain to those close to her. But today, The people, the flowers, and the sea are all united, Celebrating the memory of that fragrant youth, Hoping for her peaceful rest as they perform this beautiful ritual. This is the story of that woman, She who burned the flame of devotion, before she ended her brief life. FLAME OF DEVOTION Taku, I've got eight! What about you? Wow, no match for you! Hey, look at that! - What is she doing? - Isn't that the girl from the mountain? Hey. Are you alright? Don't bother me! What do you want, flat-nose! Flat-nosed Taku! Is it trying to hide from the girl? What? Get over here! This was the first time that Takuji saw Kiyono. Stop! Takuji was 12 years old. Kiyono was ten. There was no war; It was a peaceful time. Takuji grew up as the eldest son in the Maruyoshi clan of net fishermen. He graduated from a marine school and by the time he joined the family trade, there was no one who would call him Flat-Nose. Takuji's mother and co-workers, all hoped he would quickly lead the family business. But reality was not so kind. When they turned 20, men were required to serve in the military, a civic duty which awaited Takuji as well. There were several things Takuji wanted to do before he enlisted. One of them was to purchase the materials he needed to build his own boat. One day, he left home in order to fulfill that dream. Young boss, this will make a great boat! Takuji made a promise to himself: Upon returning from the military, he would build his own boat, and set sail on fishing expeditions from the Sea of Japan, visiting the coral-studded seas around the world. The mountain owner had told Takuji about a shortcut back to the sea. Then, as he was getting thirsty, he discovered a quiet hamlet hidden among the hills. Excuse me. Excuse me! Welcome. You've come far. We've all been waiting since you approached us. Please, come in. Wait a minute. I was just passing by. I'm aware. But today happens to be a distinguished day for us. We only wish to offer you some tea. But I should... Please don't refuse. I do not wish to disappoint the others. Come. As he watched the emblem of a butterfly flutter in the wind, Takuji remembered the folk tales that his parents told him, of the exiles from the Heike clan. Long ago, having lost the Battle of Dan-no-Ura, members of the Heike clan were scattered. One such group settled in this area. Centuries later, on the seventh day of each eighth lunar month, as the Tanabata makes his way across the heavens, the descendants of the Heike still honor their spirits, by dedicating their mind and body to chants. Thank you for coming. Please accept my appreciation. You've done well. Mother will take your place. Rest over there. But I'm about to guide this gentleman home. Guide him? This man... He visited us because he was lost. No, I-- I insist. Okay? Well, then. Let's have one of our men take him. Mom. That would be rude to our guest. I'll walk him myself. Please wait! Join us here, and write some poetry with us. I will be right back. Kiyono. She just can't resist. I will leave you now. I do know my way around. Please wait for her. Once she has decided on something, she doesn't listen. But I... You're headed back to the sea, aren't you? You have the scent of the ocean winds on you. That girl likes the sea more than the mountain... She's a troublesome one. Let's write some poetry. Please write some with me. Okay, let's go! Listen. I haven't told your father or Ayano. - So come back quickly. - I know. I'm just going to enjoy the moonlight. Goodbye. See, you did need a guide! Here, I'll show you the way. You can almost smell the tides from here. Let's hurry! Watch out, there's a hole here! Don't fall in, now! I love the sea. It's big. It's manly. And it's kind. I love the sea! If you hadn't come, they'd have me reading chants about now. Thanks! You're a funny fellow. All the parts I complained about got fixed up. You're not flat-nosed or bowlegged any more. Such a funny man. Takuji waited for Kiyono by the shore every day. Some days, Kiyono did come, and on other days, she didn't. Takuji could do nothing but wait. Takuji skipped work again. Should he be dating that girl from the mountain? I know. The ocean kid from our village, poached by a mountain girl... Can't be good. Perhaps, but look at 'em! They're meant for each other. If Takuji's the ocean kid, that girl's a mountain goddess! - You're right. - Yeah. Brother! Brother! What could that be? An order to enlist came for Takuji. He had three days before he enlisted. Young boss, be well! I can't find Kiyono. What do I do? Want me to tell her anything? Be careful out there! Kiyono. Three years in the military had turned Takuji into a strong man. Welcome home. I'm back. You've become so manly. Don't go anywhere. In her first letter addressed to Takuji, Kiyono apologized for missing his send-off. "I am not a tenacious woman. I was not prepared to send you off and remain calm in front of everyone else." In her final letter, her 52nd one, she had mentioned marriage. "If I am to reveal our relationship to my parents, I believe we must tread very carefully." "After all, among the Heike outcasts, I would be the first to leave and marry someone from another village." "Above all, I would hate to hurt my mother, who has been so kind to me." Kiyono and Takuji's wedding took place in the fall of the following year. While various concerns had been raised, thanks to the understanding and efforts of her parents, the townsfolk were able to move past old tradition. Of course, were it not for Takuji and Kiyono's warm characters, the people believed it would not have become such a joyous occasion. The day fell on the 2600th anniversary of the founding of the empire. The whole of Japan was exuberant. At the time, no one realized that it was merely a prelude that would lead Japan toward its unfortunate fate. Kiyono, do you understand? This knife is an heirloom of the Kusaka family. Are you tired? That's it over there. It's a hot spring, though it only has two cottages. Hey. That song back there. The one your grandfather sang for us. Can you sing it again? The boat may be pristine And its oars unspoiled But without a man to steer it Even that boat will stay anchored Young Madam! Takuji's come back! - Go on and greet him! - Hurry up! You must be so happy. So hot for each other! Welcome back! I'm back. Wow, that's a big tree! Isn't it? I'm gonna build a boat with this to cross the Pacific. You're his wife? Thank you for traveling so far. Your husband rushed me along. I was wondering what's the hurry, but now I see! Now I want to hurry on home, too! How's the fishing? It's just like you. Me? The fishes all came rushing to see me! - Oh, and I heard Yasuko's back from Tokyo! - Oh? And guess what? She's with a fine-looking soldier. She's caused a stir! Yasuko is Takuji's cousin. She is studying medicine in Tokyo, but has come home to introduce her fianc?. He was a navy sub-lieutenant, a career military man. Let me help you, Kiyono. Don't worry, I can handle it! So how's life as a newlywed? It's great, we're so happy! I'm jealous. - I'm impressed, Yasuko. - Me? Why? They say there might be a big war soon. Aren't you worried about marrying a soldier? Why would I be? You're okay with it? I don't want a war, either. But if it happens, won't we all be in the same boat? Taku will be taken for the war, too. Right? Taku... The Second World War began. In peacetime, this man was a record keeper at the town hall, away from any spotlight. But from December 8th onwards, he had the honorable duty of delivering draft notices. Look up at the sky above the East Sea, as the dawn breaks See the sun rise ever so high and shine ever so brightly Feel the pulse of energy across heaven and earth Hope is high for our land, Ooyashima Oh, in this serene morning Through the clouds we see The majestic sight of Fuji... The wife sews the last thread. Put your heart in it, now. It'll be alright. Don't you worry! - No American bullet's gonna hit him. - That's right! No worries! Where are you going? I'm a little drunk, so I'm getting some fresh air. It'll be okay. I'll come back. I'm going to build this boat, and sail the Pacific! I'm coming home! I'm not a tenacious woman. I'm no good... I'm headed off. Brother! Young Boss, be well! Young Boss! Young Boss! My dear! Thank you for taking the time to come. Thank you all for your efforts. Look at that young wife. Tough to send off her husband like that. - She's impressive. - Yeah. Sister, are you alright? Sis-- I'm fine. Raise it up! Up, up! Higher! In order to escape the painful feelings for Takuji, Kiyono headed out to the sea of her own accord. Her rubber pants and her rubber jacket were both left behind by Takuji. In them, she found Takuji's warmth. Even amidst the rough waves at sea, Takuji's scent remained. Kiyono stayed on the boats against the opposition of others. You know... One time, your brother and I-- What's that about my brother? It's nothing. I wonder how long I can stay like this. But Shuuji, you're still-- Yeah, but... They say they might start the physical exams earlier. And look how fit I am. After Yasuko sent off her husband to the southern front soon after their wedding, she and her doctor parents left Tokyo, and worked from her grandfather's house. Oh, don't... A patient shouldn't be doing this. Now that you've given me that shot, I feel refreshed. Please. Fine green tea. When you sit here... You can't imagine there's a war out there. I know. You start to think the whole world is at peace, but they're fighting somewhere, right now. It's unbelievable. It's true. We can't see it with our own eyes. Don't know if we're winning or losing. But it's always life or death. When there's a peaceful land like this... It's terrible. Just with a single order... We're torn apart. Who can be so decisive if it wasn't for war? The soldiers themselves... Are they thinking the same? Why certainly, of course! Maybe Taku does. But who knows about Noriyoshi. Why? I... I don't believe in a man and a woman. I wondered in the beginning, too. These men are headed to war... How can they remain so calm? But when I saw their faces as they were leaving, I realized. If you look at them closely... Every man headed to battle has a rare, beautiful look on them. Their various emotions are distilled into one. Their eyes turn so pure. The men must be tenacious, too. Or so I convinced myself. Don't you think so? Well... And yet... Men are so cruel. Even with their beautiful looks on their face, They still leave us behind. They're off at war. If a woman showed a face like that... It's when she's going insane. Women may look simple, but our body and mind are more complex than a man's. A man might be pure... But the fine shards of emotion that collect inside of a woman... That's completely different. The tenacity of a woman... It lasts through time and suffering. It doesn't end like it does for a man. Don't women live in vain? It has always been this way. As it was for the Genji and the Heike. Don't you think so? The village suffered its first casualty of war. Until yesterday, this man had the honor of delivering draft notices. But starting today, he became the bearer of death notices. People feared him, and he feared the people. Now, now. I came to pay my respects. I don't have any news for anyone today. Really. Really. As the war intensified, Takuji's letters became increasingly sporadic. And as for Kiyono's letters, it appeared that Takuji was not receiving them. From his hasty pencil strokes, Kiyono could smell the blood of war. From the suppressed lines, she could feel Takuji's love. With both their manpower and ships taken from them for the war effort, the wives began to make salt through traditional means to earn their keep. Who's it for? Who's it for? For you, ma'am. He's dead? No. Injury. He's just injured. Not dead. "Come to the navy hospital in Sasebo" Please, this way. Your wife is here to see you. Does it hurt? It's alright now. Takuji's injury was from a gunshot to his right thigh. His wound worsened on his way from the field hospital. As a result, the doctor planned to amputate the leg. Kiyono vehemently opposed that. The doctor said he couldn't ensure Takuji's survival. Kiyono didn't care, she responded. It was a dangerous bet with Takuji's life. Takuji's wound worsened day by day, and at last, he contracted pneumonia. But as spring arrived at the hospital, Takuji was able to stand with Kiyono beside him. The doctor told Kiyono it was a miracle. Kiyono nodded, with sunken eyes. On their ride home from Sasebo, Kiyono said, she wanted to live by themselves, not bothered by anyone else. Takuji asked her why. Kiyono remained silent. Takuji decided to accept all of her selfish demands. Kiyono! Taku! Taku, are you alright? Are you hurt? Impossible? What's impossible? If you won't listen to me... I can't be responsible if something happens. Yasuko. Our ancestors... They were driven into the woods by Genji. There they tended each others' wounds and vowed revenge against Genji. The things that other people can't do... We can do them. When the doctor wanted to cut off Taku's leg, I protected him. "If you can't walk, I'll make you walk." The Taku I want is the same one from the past. I'll have nothing to do with a crippled Taku. Even if you can't... I'll make Taku just like he was before. I can do that. As she promised, Kiyono revived Takuji. It was not a miracle, but rather a long, arduous journey. Kiyono's ancestors used this land as a pasture, riding horses and training for their eventual battle with Genji. It was mere coincidence, that Kiyono breathed new life in this very place. Taku, want to go outside? - Alright, let's go. - Carry me. Carry you? - That's right, on your back! - Alright, get on. Ready? Hold on tight. Choo choo! It's a coal hut. Hey! How about making some coal together? We can make lots of good coal, and share it with the villagers. They'll love it! How about it? What's the matter? Taku, how about some lunch? Okay, be right there! I made some soup. Alright, hang on! What a place. Can't see anything in there. Look at your face, Taku! I'll give you a silly face, too! Don't do that! Here I come. I've got you. You're embarrassing me! Thank you for coming to me. It's been so long. Make me pretty and make Taku happy. I'm counting on you. There you have it. Doesn't hurt at all. Listen, I can even take the horse if I wanted to. When you came back from Sasebo, you were no more than a corpse. We worried more about your life than about walking again. It's thanks to the Buddha. It's unbelievable. It's not the Buddha. Your mother sends you this. Mom? Hope she's doing alright. Her eyesight's failing lately. What's this? She was ill. Why didn't you tell me? We thought about it, but Yasuko stopped us-- But it's an illness! Hey. Won't you come down from the mountain with us? The mountain? There's something we want to ask from you. There's only women, children, and old geezers like us left in the village. We just can't go on like this. We were sent here by the rest of the villagers. Won't you come back with us? - But-- - We don't want much. Just a day or two. The boats that the military took, they've left some behind. Just get them to sell it back to us. We asked them, but they didn't give us the time of day. But you, you're a former navy man. I do want to see my mom. Please. We're all counting on you, Young Boss. Taku, isn't this so pretty? It's gorgeous. Which one of these do you like? Let's see... Look at this. A scary face, isn't it? This represents the tenacity of women. Back then... When a man headed off to battle, His woman wore this and waited for him. The pain and bitterness of the woman is in here. You can almost hear her weeping. Kiyono. What is it? How about we visit the village today? The village? Yeah. Just stay for a night and come back. - We have to stock up on things, too. - I don't want to go. There's nothing to buy! Why so suddenly? What did they say to you? What did they say? It's almost sundown, please have them leave. Offer them your coal as a gift. I'm sorry. Send them my regards. Give this to Mom. "Fighters launch themselves at enemy" "A heroic charge to eliminate enemy units" Here's the notice. They commandeered 37 ships. Only four ships are left in the village. And they're all old and rotting. We can't survive with only the women's salt farms. This isn't enough. You need something more... A better way to ask for support for the village. We gotta make it obvious to anyone. And we're asking you to do that. So when will you come down with us? When? Well, it can't be today. Young Boss. Didn't you read your mother's letter that I brought you? She's too frail to even ride in a horse carriage, and she still wrote it. I know that. Besides... Who knows how long you'll be able to stay here? Why's that? I'm saying you don't know when the next draft notice will come! - A draft notice? - That's right. Young Boss, why are you so surprised? The war isn't over, you know. Your brother is out there fighting, too. Hope you haven't forgotten that while you're here! You know Seiichiro in the next village, right? He came back after he lost an eye. Another draft notice came a couple of days ago. I couldn't believe it. But that's where we stand in the war. Kiyono. Kiyono! Kiyono! No! Don't touch me! If a man is crippled... Does he not go to war? Isn't that right? Then we should cut off that leg. I'll cut it! Kiyono. That leg doesn't belong to anyone else. It's mine. It's my leg! - I'll cut it, I'll cut it! - Kiyono! A draft notice... We don't know if they'll send one. Even this war isn't going to last forever. There's an end to this. Right? No... Kiyono. - Kiyono! - No! Don't follow me... No! Kiyono. No, no... Kiyono! Come out of there! I wish you didn't recover! Wearing this in the middle of a war? It's because you brought it to her. Takuji's trying to leave the mountain. It's not Takuji's fault, it's Kiyono's. That's right. Kiyono's bound him up here. It was a mistake to marry a Heike outcast. I was against it. We should just break them up! H-Hold on, we're only saying this, because we're worried about you, Young Boss! - Please leave. - Takuji! Please listen to us, we-- Leave! What did Kiyono ever do? She was only crying. Out of everyone's sight. She was just crying, alone in that dark hut! That woman... She says she's not tenacious. But all by herself... Please leave. Don't come back. Kiyono. Come out of there. Everyone's gone. Just the two of us. Kiyono! You can keep sleeping. Taku. What? You should go home. What about you? I'll wait for you. Come back in three days. Three days! Yasuko...! I'm sorry to surprise you. I wanted to see you all of a sudden. Did something happen? Where's Taku? He went to the village. Oh. We missed each other. Yasuko, did something happen? What happened? Tell me. He died. Died? Who!? Noriyoshi...? This notice came. Yasuko... You're... You're crying for me? I can't even cry. I thought I would, once I was by myself. But then I came all the way here. And I still can't cry. Yasuko. That man... He had a birthmark... It was under his feet. That's all I remember. The look on his face as he died... I can't even picture it. Another one must've died... They say they'll return these three ships, at least. Here's the proof of their return. It's the military. We've gotta be patient. Alright? Is it for me? Is it about Seiichi!? It's for Takuji. Shuuji!? Is Shuuji dead? It's a draft notice for you. What day is it? - I only have three days, right? - Yeah. Mom. It finally came. What, you knew? I was worried it was about Shuuji. Aren't you glad it wasn't? When do you leave? I only have three days. Mom. Hurry back to the mountain for her. I'll bring her back by tonight. Besides, I have to bring some things here. Hurry on. Mom. Let's at least spend the three days together, okay? I'm heading out. Giddy up! Whoa! - I'm back! I'm back! - Welcome home! What's this? My princess hasn't even lit the fireplace? Well then. Your servant shall warm up this room at once. - Oh, there's no firewood! - Ah, I've been so distracted! - Sorry, I'll get some right now! - No, no! That's the servant's duty. Perhaps the princess will prepare dinner for the servant... He's a tad hungry. Very well. Bring me some firewood. At once. Wait, Takuji. You've broken your promise and returned a day early. Why is that? Oh, how embarrassing. I yearned for my princess, so I rushed home on a faster horse! Do you doubt me? Are you claiming... That you adore your princess that much? Yep! Then show me some proof. Here it is. You're a good man. That's enough. Let me go. Now, Takuji! "I yearned for my princess, so I rushed home on a faster horse!" Taku is so dramatic. He even brought a wagon, as if we were moving! Why did he bring a wagon? Taku. What are you hiding from me? Tell me. What is the princess saying-- Are we leaving the mountain? Is that it? It must be! Kiyono, what are you saying? Why would we-- Then, what's that wagon for? What's a wagon for besides carrying our belongings? - What's that wagon for? Tell me the truth! - Kiyono... Kiyono. Look at this horse. A pack horse with strong legs. These horses... They don't run well without a load on them. That's all there is. Okay? If... If we had to leave the mountain... Why would I hide that? This cottage, this is our life, isn't it? Promise? I promise. Will you swear not to leave the mountain? I swear. I'm about to go crazy. Yasuko's husband died in the war. You mustn't go anywhere! I don't want you to go! What's the matter? You're like ice. Come, let's go inside. We'll light the fire, and start the bath. Okay? Oh, dear... What? I forgot to shut the door to the coal hut. It'll be fine, check it in the morning. No! All the coal will be ruined. I'm sorry. Will you go and close it? Alright. Don't catch a cold. "Draft Notice" Kiyono! Kiyono! He's just going out there to die. What are they going to do at this point? It's so cruel. Hang in there, Kiyono. Taku... What's the matter, Kiyono? You're drenched! Kiyono. Every woman suffers in a time like this. It has always been this way. Yasuko, she feels the same sorrow too. Only you lack the perseverance... What a pitiful child. While Kiyono awoke from her long coma, her spirit did not immediately return. The people believed it was a period of rest given to her by god. Her pale, rigid face slowly began to soften. It was gradually replaced by an innocent smile, which relieved the townsfolk. Early June. The news that Takuji was killed at war was delivered. My poor sister! Kiyono's mother, upon hearing of Takuji's death, wished Kiyono would never return to her senses. The mother knew best what would happen, if Kiyono learned of Takuji's death. Okinawa fell in the end of June. As Takuji died before the forces reached Okinawa, the gossipy townsfolk, who enjoyed tales of destiny, wondered if he had perished at sea just around the time Kiyono's spirit was broken and she fell into her daze. August 15th. The war ended. "The war's no good ending now, only now after it's created so many sad and pitiful people." Those were the words of Kiyono's younger sister Ayano, as she listened to the surrender on the radio. Two days later, as if they had suddenly remembered, the villagers broke into dance. It was not because they found themselves free from the confines of war, but rather, they had nothing else to turn to. Such feelings of despair and rage were palpable all around them. Yasuko. Do you know where Kiyono is? Weren't you with her? She was with me earlier, but I lost sight of her. What should we do? I don't think we need to worry. Search over there, Ayano. I'll check here. That night, what Kiyono's mother had feared the most occurred. Taku? Sis... Taku... Welcome home... So the war's over. It's no good, ending now. Ayano. You can walk home, right? Won't you lend me this horse? Where are you going, sis? Let's go home together. Okay? Your sister... There's a place she must go to. Forgive me, Ayano. Sis... You mustn't die! I won't. I'll be home soon. Tell Mom she needn't worry. Taku. Kiyono! Choo choo! Look at your face, Taku! I'll give you a silly face, too! You should rest already. Your sister will be alright. Your mother will watch her. Ayano. Mom. You mustn't fall asleep. You... ...are not a tenacious child! Tenacity need not emerge solely from hatred or resentment. It is as likely to manifest itself wherever human emotion is found, however beautiful or pure it may be.
