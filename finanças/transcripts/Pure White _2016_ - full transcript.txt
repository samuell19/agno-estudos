And then... Thank you. You're welcome. Mr. Keiichi. You can also take photos inside. Okay, thank you. What's wrong? This girl... Do you know her? Don't know her. She was just here a moment ago. I see. Ren is really lucky. To marry such a beautiful wife. Finally, it's all over. I can relax now. Please have some. Yeah. Oh, by the way... "It might not be the best time to talk about Ren's matters now. How about giving this to Yukina? What's this? Photos for matchmaking. let me see. he's a bit older. But he has a simple and gentle personality. Maybe we shouldn't set Yukina up for a blind date. Why? she might not like it. I don't think so, right, Mashiro? no hair. bald. You're really something, saying things like that. Quick, take this to your brother's place. Got it. Take care on the way. Alright. Take care. Feels good. What do you think, boss? It's good. It's good? That wraps up the work on this end. Thank you. I'll tidy up. Thanks for your help. Sure. Boss, thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to meet with us. It's all thanks to you that we were able to create a great webpage. No, I should be the one thanking you. It wasn't easy, coming all the way from Tokyo to our countryside. It must be a bit dull here, right? Not at all. It's quite interesting. It's a nice place. It seems like he really likes it here. Isn't it about time? Mashiro, why are you here? Hello. Hello. This is my sister, Mashiro. Nice to meet you. He's Kugayama's nephew. He was assigned to the Yagata Police Station last week. Nice to meet you. I'm Shibuya Mashiro. Thank you for always taking care of my brother. I should be thanking your brother for looking out for me. What's this? Chinese cabbage. Thank you. I'll be heading off now. Are you leaving already? Take care on the way. Is your sister interested in indoor soccer? What? My girlfriend's team is recruiting. No, no, Mashiro is not an normal girl. What? She has a mild cognitive impairment from birth. Her intellectual development is delayed. I see. You can't tell at all. At first glance, she seems fine. She can interact normally with new people. She's really cute, what a shame. What do you mean? Just feel like she's cute... What do you mean by 'she's really cute'? It's nothing. There's nothing to be sorry about. I'm sorry. You can take whichever you like. Okay. Throw that one away. Got it. Don't throw it here. Take it home and dispose of it. Understood. This one looks nice. Did you buy it in Tokyo? Yes. Yukina, when are you going back to Tokyo? I'm not going back. How about your boyfriend? Aren't you getting married? How can I marry someone who already has a wife? Your hair has grown longer. Just a little. Come to the shop tomorrow. I'll give you a haircut. Understood. Yui. Let's cancel next week's photoshoot for now. just received notice from the client. Their plans have completely changed. I'm really sorry about this. I see. Yuri, you're in Toyama now, right?" Why not take the opportunity to relax there? You did say you wanted to create some work, too. In any case, that's the situation. That's how it is. - Is that okay? - It's fine, it's fine. I quite like the photos Yuri takes. Although he's skilled, he's not easy to manage. It's already 2 o'clock. I'm heading out. Where are you going? To HONMA. Take care on the way. Understood. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. You're here. Mashiro, come in. Okay. Long time no see, Mashiro. Long time no see. Mashiro, have you become even more beautiful? yes. How much do you want to cut? Just a little. I like having long hair. Is that so? Do you want to curl your eyelashes? No, thank you. Mascara-curled lashes look even cuter, you know. It'll hurt. My skills aren't that bad. How about giving it a try? Well then, Auntie, shall I make you look cute? What did you just say? Amiya photo studio. Sorry to keep you waiting. Thank you. Please have a seat. Alright. How did it go? Take a look inside. Take a look inside. Young man, you've taken some impressive photos. Thank you for the compliment. They're all quite good, I'm pleasantly surprised. You're bound to become a photography expert. -Is that so? - Yes. Thank you. I have a question. The photo in the middle. The one in the middle? was that taken nearby? It's this one. That's the Tateyama Mountain Range. You captured it beautifully. Thank you for the compliment. This photo was taken with this, right? It was taken with this? Yes. Is this still in use? It's still working very well. I'm sorry. No problem. We've met before at the shrine, haven't we? I helped you retrieve your handkerchief. i have something to give you. What is it? I have something to give you. Do you have time now? A little bit. I'll wait for you at the next pier. Can you make it there in time? Alright. I'll count on you. I'm sorry. It's okay. You seem quite busy. Not really. Is this it? What is it? It seems to be something you accidentally captured. I took the liberty of developing it. It's a great shot. Keep it. I'm giving it to you. Thank you. Well, I should be going. Um, excuse me. Excuse me again Are you a local resident? I want to go to Wuyu Mountain. Do you know the way? Could you please tell me? Is it far? No, it's not far. Can we take the tram? Can't we go? Can't we take the sightseeing boat either? Then how do the locals get there? They go by bicycle. I see. is there no bus? There is, but it's never on time. Is everything alright? No worries. This is an uphill slope. Let me ride. I'll do it. Hop on. No need. I can run. It's still quite far, isn't it? Hop on. Hold on tight. Is it okay? Let's go. Are you okay? No worries. This is truly a wonderful place. Hmm. This shot turned out well. I took some photos on the boat earlier too. I see. It's really beautiful. Let's explore some other spots too. Use this to switch pictures one by one. It's a bit heavy. Hmm. Hmm. You can take a shot and see. Ah, you're not familiar with it, are you? look here. This is the shutter. Press it to take a photo. What an interesting face. That expression is really good. I like looking at the scenery from here. You can see the entire Mount Tateyama. Today is clear, and you can see Mount Tateyama clearly too. Is the tallest one Mount Tateyama? All of them are. The whole range is Mount Tateyama. Tateyama mountain range I see. Don't you know? I came from Tokyo for business. oh. I haven't given you a business card yet, have I? I'm Yui, a photographer. Yui. Yes. As for me... My name is Mashiro. Miss Mashiro. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. If possible, please contact me when you're free. You brought me to such a distant place. I'd like to treat you to a meal as a thank you. I might be in Toyama for a while. Could you recommend some good places to eat? Sure. Mashiro. Do you want an apple? I'm coming in. Auntie is asking if you want an apple. Is everything okay? Mmm, it's really delicious. Is your fever gone? 37.1 degrees. That's about normal body temperature. That's actually normal body temperature. They're just being overly protective of you. Yukina, aren't you going to work? I'm off today. Huh, what's this? A photo. Really... Why hide it, Yukina? Let me see, let me see. So cute. You took it well. What's going on here? Someone else gave it to me. Who gave it to you? A person named Yui. who? Yui. Yuri? Who's that? The business card... Is he a photographer? From Tokyo, right? What's really going on? Met him at the shrine on my brother's wedding day. not bad. And then? Met him on the street yesterday. He gave me this. Asked me to contact him. Why? Because I took him to Mount Kurehayama. Kurehayama? Why did you go there? To take photos. He said he wanted to thank me by treating me to a meal and asked me to contact him. You should've told me earlier. My phone is down there. My phone, where's my phone? Is there a phone? Phone! hurry up! What are you doing? call him. Here you go. I already dialed. No one's picking up. It's in voicemail mode. shrine… I don't think I've seen him before. How could this be? He's calling back. He's calling back! Mashiro, answer it! Hurry! I can't, I can't. Hurry up, shh! Why aren't you answering? No, no. If you don't answer, Auntie will. No, no. Here it comes, here it comes. It hurts, it hurts. Here it comes, here it comes. No, don't! Nothing to worry about. Listen to me. No, don't! Hurry up, why aren't you answering? No, no. Hmm? Hello. This is Yui. Did you just call me? Um... Hello? I am Shibuya. Ah, is this Miss Mashiro? yes. Has Miss Mashiro always lived here? Yes. I see. This place is really nice. I was born and raised in Tokyo. I've always admired places like this. I haven't been to Tokyo. Of course, Tokyo has its own merits. Yukina says the same thing. Is she your friend? She's my cousin. Lives next door to me. Next door, huh? That's great. Feeling like relatives living together, that's the kind of sensation you can only experience in the countryside. We shouldn't really call it "countryside," right? I'm sorry. It's okay, this is indeed the countryside. Are there any nearby attractions you could recommend to me? What? Not touristy spots, though. Places where locals go, with good views. Those kinds of hidden gems that only this place can offer. Are there any? Mmm. There are. There should be. Really? Mmm. Could you tell me about them? Mmm. I want to go take photos. This is a bit hard to understand. Where would it roughly be? i can't read a maps. I see. In this case… I can take you. Maybe tomorrow. Really? Hm. But, Miss Mashiro, you don't need to work? I'm just looking after the shop. Hardly any customers come in, really. I see. So, can I count on you? Mmm. In that case, I'll teach you photography. Do you have a camera? My dad's camera should be lying around somewhere. Then bring it tomorrow. Sorry to keep you waiting. Thanks for your hospitality. You're welcome. Be careful on your way back. You can borrow the bicycle. It's inconvenient without one. Isn't it inconvenient for you too? We have so many bicycles at home, we could sell them. Really? My family sells bicycles. Oh, I see. In that case, I'll borrow one. Hm. How will you get back? I'll walk. Isn't it far? I'll walk you a part of the way. Hm. Let's do that then. I'm back. Welcome back. You're back so late, where were you? Just went for a walk. You're eating without washing your hands? Did you take TAMO for a walk? Mom, where's the camera? Camera? Why do you need the camera? For taking photos. Where's the camera? It should be in the cabinet. Got it. Don't you take TAMO for a walk? Good evening, I'm heading up. Mashiro. How was the date? Tell me! He treated me to ice cream and soda. That's nice. And then? We've agreed he'll teach me photography. Great! And then? Is there something else? Mashiro. What's up? Where's your bicycle? Where did you put it? I lost it. It's so pretty. Do you know how to use it? Press it like this to take a photo. Press the triangle button, and here... Mmm. It comes out. Got it. Alright. Just take some random shots. look. You should angle it a bit higher. Uncle, is this Tateyama? Yes, indeed. It's so beautiful. Isn't it? Did Uncle take this photo? Yes, he did. He used this camera. - This one? - Hm. Have you climbed Mount Tateyama during your outings? I haven't gone on any outings. I see. You should try climbing it if you have the chance. Here, your photos. Mashiro. Great! I'll be back after a quick visit to HONMA. Didn't you just go there? What are you up to, anyway? Eyelashes. Eyelashes? Hair Salon HONMA. Too stiff. I can't even press the buttons. Goodbye. welcome. Mashiro. What's wrong? Could you make my eyebrows a bit more curled? Didn't you say it would hurt if you did the eyes? I can endure it. Really? Wait a moment. Alright. You can still fully wear this, right? Really? I'm sorry for bringing so much. It's okay. I'm just so excited for the baby to be born. Thank you. I'll step outside. Where are you going? It's rare for Mashiro to smile like that. I'll be back in a moment. Sorry Recently, she doesn't even look at the store and keeps running outside. Wait a moment, Mom. Mashiro. Here, I got this for you. Isn't it cute? Very cute, thank you. Mmm, it looks great. Remember to dress nicely for your date. It's not like that. Be careful on the way. I'm heading out. Completely different. What's different? They were taken at the same place. But they look completely different from what I shot. Really? So Yui's impression of this place is like this? And Mashiro, is this how you see it? Mashiro, you... What's up? You seem a bit strange. Really? A bit strange. Really? Do you find me repulsive? Why would you think that? Not at all. I think you look great like this. Is that so? Can you take a photo? Can't see it clearly. Let me try. Count 1 2 Yukina still refuses to go on a blind date, huh? She says her appearance isn't good enough. Isn't it a bit late to be saying that? She'll be 32 next year. That's not something she should say now. After all, she doesn't have hair. Mashiro. This is all because Tatsuo always indulged Yukina. I'm full. You're not done eating yet? I'll step outside. where are you going? Just going outside for a bit. Remember to come back for dinner. I know. Where does she go with the camera every day? I don't know. It's okay, she's not doing anything bad. I'm planning to go back to Tokyo next Monday. Why? I've taken some good shots here. I want to organize them back there. I see. So, this weekend, I'm planning a 2-day, 1-night climb of Mount Tateyama. What are you planning to do? I really want to capture the sunrise here. The weather seems good too. I also... I also want to go together. That's Mount Kurehayama. I heard it's quite challenging. I want to climb with you. Are you serious? I'm Mashiro. Can I come in? come in. what's wrong? Where's Mashiro? She said she was going to Yukina's place. I see. Missing girl found safe. Listen, I want to make this clear upfront. Climbing Mount Kurehayama is super tough. I know. Um... Did Yui invite you to go together? I was the one who suggested going together. But I guess staying overnight won't work, right? Why? Why are you asking why... I want to go together. I understand your feelings. How did you explain things to Uncle and Aunt? Yui said he's going back to Tokyo. when? on Monday. Alright, I understand. I'll figure something out. Hold onto this. welcome. Sorry, I'm late. Actually, I'm the one who suddenly asked you out. No, no, no. I'm really sorry. I've prepared the first draft of the promotional brochure. I wanted you to take a look. Thank you. Please have a look. Welcome. Thank you. I'll have a coffee. Understood. I have something to discuss with you. What is it? Is it still possible to change the photos now? Change the photos? Yes. Wait a mininute. Lately, I've been working on my personal projects, and I think they're turning out quite well. Although that's the case, This one, I feel a bit bad about it. I managed to take even better shots. It's these ones. Is this Azuma Bridge? Yes. It's indeed quite nice. What should I do? And also this one. But, well... It's a bit difficult to change now. We're already at this stage. Could you help me check with the designer? If you have trouble reaching out to him, I can contact him directly. Then I'll ask first tomorrow. I'm counting on you. Sure. Take a look at this photo. This person... The one I met at the shrine. - Do you remember her? - I remember. Later on, we ran into each other and got to know each other better. She's the daughter of the bicycle shop owner, right? Yes. She has intellectual disabilities. Intellectual disabilities, huh? You didn't know? This girl is quite well-known around here, or rather, infamous. She was a victim of a kidnapping incident 20 years ago. I see. That's what I heard from government officials. Hm. It was indeed a big news back then. But she was safely rescued later, and the perpetrator was arrested. I see. I might have been too nosy in saying that. Hm. It's probably best not to get involved with her if possible. Why? This is a small town. If there's any gossip, it might trouble you too. No, it's not the kind of relationship that would lead to gossip. But she does have issues. How do we determine what constitutes having issues or not? If we're talking about not being able to adapt to society, I think I fit that category as well. Welcome back. I won't be home for dinner on Saturday. I'm going to play with Yukina and her friends. I see. I'll go take a shower. Ah, young man. Could you stop for a moment? Sure. No lights on? It's dark, and it's dangerous without lights. Please turn them on. Ah, I'm sorry. Is this your bicycle? No, it's not. It's borrowed from a friend. ah yes I see. Could you wait while I check the stolen goods database? Sure. what's your friend's name? Shibuya. Shibuya? Yes. The Shibuya who runs the bicycle shop? Shibuya Mashiro? Are you Mashiro's boyfriend? Mr Shibuya? Oh, it's Kurehayama Mountain Patrol. Here again, slacking off at my place. No, I have something I want to ask you. What's the matter? It's about Mashiro. Have you ever heard her mention anything about her bike being stolen or something? No, I haven't heard her say anything about that. Well, here's the thing. Last night, I stopped someone riding a bike without lights, and it turns out the bike is registered under Mashiro's name. But the person claims he borrowed it from Mashiro. Ah, that person must be Yukina, right? My cousin. No, it's a guy. What? It's Ren. What? Is your mom around? Yeah. What? Mashiro's... Really? Understood. Hang up. What did Ren say? Mashiro might have been scammed by a suspicious guy. What? I'm back. Mashiro. What's wrong? Where are you headed today? Going to a friend's house with Yukina. Stay home today. Why? Don't ask questions. Just don't go anywhere. Why? You skip work every day and go somewhere, right? Was your previous bike really stolen? Yeah. Wasn't it lent to someone? Let's not dwell on the bike issue. Starting today, just stay at home. Work, too... No need to go anymore. Don't see that guy again. I'm here. Oh, no need. I'll pick you up. Hello, I'm Shibuya. Mashiro's not home. Please don't look for Mashiro anymore. She won't answer even if you call. I'm back. You're back, huh? Where's Mashiro? In her room. She hasn't come out once since morning. Is that so? The bath water's ready. Mashiro, it's time to eat. Come down. Good evening. You're here. I'm sorry, Yukina. You're busy, and I still called you here. It's alright. Is Mashiro upstairs? She hasn't eaten anything since yesterday. Mashiro. It's Yukina. Come in. Is she asleep? No, she's awake. If she's awake, she should respond. Dinner is ready. Let's eat together. I canceled our plans. I see. My dad... He said I can't see Yui anymore. What? Why would your dad know about Yui? I have no idea either. Did you contact Yui? Why? I lost the paper with his phone number. Which hotel is he staying at? I'll call him for you. Apologize sincerely to him. He probably hates me now. Why would he? I'll never see him again. Mashiro. My heart hurts so much. Liking someone is painful, right? Liking someone is painful, right? Is Mashiro asleep? Yeah. Yukina, you know about this, right? What's going on? Mashiro has been meeting a suspicious man. He's probably not that suspicious. He's definitely not a good person. even if it's true what's wrong with having a couple of male friends? You all are overly protective of her. It's okay if they're local guys, but if they're from Tokyo... what's wrong? If something happens, it'll be too late to save her. He won't do anything to her. Being deceived by a shady guy... It's not like that. How do you know other people are not good? What if something happens and this kid can't explain? So, I'm saying... Everyone is overly protective of Mashiro. Mashiro isn't like normal girl. Mashiro is also at an age where she should be able to date. What's wrong with liking one or two guys? You don't understand at all. Yes, Mashiro might have some intellectual challenges, but she's much more capable than you all imagine. It's not the same. Why? Just because she was born with a disability, does that mean she can't have feelings for someone? Should she give up on ordinary things as well? Perhaps you can't understand, but as her parents, we have a responsibility to protect her. So, you plan to keep her locked up at home forever? Mashiro doesn't understand everything yet. She can't be left without our family to protect her. You should trust Mashiro more. Parents shouldn't just impose strict discipline on their children. Look at yourself. What? Look at how spoiled you've become. What kind of person are you now? Hey.. Everyone here knows. You came back because you couldn't handle being someone's mistress in Tokyo. Hey.. After being toyed with by someone, you were discarded. As parents, we didn't raise our children to engage in such things just to become adults I just want to do my best to prevent Mashiro from getting hurt. Is that so? Mashiro, it's time to eat. I'm coming in. Sigh. How long do you plan to stay sulking? Husband. Yukina, what's the matter? Has Mashiro come to your place? Mashiro? No, she hasn't. What's wrong? Mashiro's missing. What? Hold on, Uncle. I'll look around nearby. Where's the flashlight? Her mom? It's by the front door. Mashiro! Mashiro! Is that so? I'm sorry for disturbing you so late. I'll hang up. Mrs. Shibuya? I'm here. This... Take a look, is this Mashiro's? Where did you find it? After you called, I went out to look because I was worried, and I found this on the way to our front door. Mashiro. sorry I canceled our plans. Don't worry about it at all. Look at this. It's so beautiful. Although the process was tough, it was worth it. How should I put it, after reaching the mountaintop, like this, watching the sunrise slowly rise, Rising slowly, after watching that, I felt like many things don't matter anymore. Many things have become unimportant. Lately, there have actually been many things that haven't been going well, things that make me frustrated too. But I feel like I can accept those frustrating things now. Mashiro, you should climb someday too. I originally wanted to watch the sunrise with you. Yeah. Do you have anywhere you want to go tomorrow? Place you want to go? Anywhere is fine. We can go take photos together, or go shopping. Is there a place you want to go? Tokyo. i want to go to Tokyo. Tokyo won't work. Is it because I have a disability? If I were a normal person, would you take me? I understand. I'll go look now. Hang up then. What's wrong? Mashiro's missing. I'll go look for her. Ren, What's wrong? Mashiro might have gone to her boyfriend's place. Boyfriend? Actually, I saw them together before. Hello. The guy who rode Mashiro's bike before, where did you meet him? Got it. Keep looking around. Hey, what did you do to Mashiro? I'm asking what you did. - Calm down, Shibuya-san. - Calm down. Let go of me. You think disabled people don't understand anything? - Don't treat Mashiro like a fool. please calm down Mashiro. Yui, Yui. Brother! Mashiro. What's going on? Oh, it's like that. Thank goodness. Don't make us worry like this. Didn't I tell you not to disappear without a word? Mom. How can I become a normal person? These are all photos taken by Mashiro. Tomorrow, I'll take Makoto to see him off. Is that okay? My name is Keiichi Yui. About what happened with Mashiro, I didn't think it through properly, and I'm truly sorry for causing you trouble. Mashiro lent me her bike. Thank you. I'm sorry. Mashiro. I'll go watch the sunrise too. To open my mind, I'll go climb Mount Tateyama to see the sunrise. The train is about to depart. Thank you. Yui, bye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Is Mashiro really okay? She's fine. The weather is so nice. See you. Mashiro, wait. Don't go too far from me. You're so slow.

What's wrong? Where did you put the hair dye? Isn't it right in front of you? Yukina, There's a nice guy in my nephew's company. Does the guy have hair? I'm thinking about getting married soon too. If he has hair and money, it's worth meeting him. Hair is really important, after all. The most important. No problem, the guy's hair is lush like a lion's mane. Really?
