[music playing] NEWSCASTER (ON RADIO): Now with the regular LBC stock market report, national editor, Douglas Moffett. The dollar's continuing strength has meant-- Your man says I can't use my car telephone for half an hour. Would you, uh-- [crash] Winston? Oh. It's this way. Shouldn't be a problem. Just stand here. [music playing] MAN (ON PHONE): Dania, it's not my fault. [banging] [MAN (ON PHONE): You just have to hang on till get there, that's all. I'm not trying to hold you back. Look, if you were as grown up as you said were, you'd realize that being adult entails looking after other people, whether it's your mother or-- If you're trying to photograph me, you're behaving rather strangely, aren't you? You've still got the lens cap on. It's a demonstration. What of? All right. Dear sir, I have a method for the sharing and retention of knowledge from organizations that might be of interest to your company. Briefly it involves transference of thought onto film. When this is developed you'll find something on it close to your heart. Dear Mr. Shadey, We regret ICC will not be able to attend your demonstration as we have no plans to expand in your specialized field. Thank you for your offer. You won't believe me now, but when this is developed, you're going to get in touch. [music playing] CONSTANCE: Carol was angry because you're late. The car broke down. What's that? It's a film, I think. I do hope she won't take any indecent photographs. I wonder about it, you know. But, one never knows. I mean, the photographer may want to catch her off guard and have the camera at angles-- It's unlikely, don't you think? CONSTANCE: It happened to a girlfriend of mine at school. My father used to make my hair stand on end with his stories. Yes. Get in your nightgown, he'd say. Sit in my lap. That went on until I was well past 14. You see-- I had no way of knowing if he were really serious. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Aha. I work out. Yep, that's what we're after. And I dance. I'm a good mover. Oh really. Belgium, Friday. OK? There's a problem. I have to look after my mother then. Oh, shit. Well, can't you bring her along? She's agoraphobic. One of those people thinks the world's gonna squash them flat as soon as they step outside the door. CAROL: Yes, she's one of those. She doesn't like being left alone inside either. Well, she can't stand in the way of your career. So you better just grab both your passports, put a paper bag over her head, and tell her you're going to take her around the corner to pick up a hot dog. [laughs] She knows I don't eat meat. Animals are fine just the way they are. Animals, yeah. But uh, most people sick and ugly. Most people, let's face it. They're not beautiful, not like you. Seriously. I have to have you in this promo. [wind blowing] CYRIL: All right. What was that? It wasn't my best, but you put me on the spot, turning up like that. That was the new Russian diamond fields they found in Siberia. I picked up you were interested in diamonds, you see. So you can think pictures onto film of anything that is happening? Yeah. What's your range? Distance is not a problem. Time is. I find it hard to concentrate for long periods of time. I become disorientated. The other limitations to my service are that I won't work for foreign powers and I will have nothing to do with military espionage. And the future? What about that? [sighs] Sir, do me the credit of taking this seriously. The future is not being offered to you. It comes to me, but only as interference. OK? All right. So what you're selling is information? That's right. Can you help me? MAN: What with? I need some money for an expensive operation. I'm going to change sex. How much? [exhales] 12,500 pounds. Thank you for coming to see me, Mr. Shadey. I'll give due consideration to your proposal. SHADEY: I WILL tell you two things nothing, although I said I wasn't going to predict. Your wife will become better, but only for a short while. And you're going to meet some men in Brighton, something to do with money. Well there's-- [music playing] CYRIL: Access our diamond file, would you? [beeps] [typing] CYRIL: What would happen if the Russians found a lot of diamonds-- a lot? ASSISTANT: Nothing, unless they start coming on the black market. Is that likely? ARTHUR: Not in any quantity, sir. I could get a abstract of the file ready for when you return from Brighton. Thank you, Arthur. [singing] [water splashing] [knocking] [water splashing] I don't understand it. The front door's open, and your mother's gone. Gone? Out? Oh. I have to go. I'll call you from the office. Aren't you going to help me look? She can't have gone far. You have got to get a minder. I will. I promise-- after the weekend. CONSTANCE: Hello? Oo-hoo. Hello, is anybody home? Oh, I can't tell you how the cost of things have gone up since I was out last. I mean, simply everything. She's better. I'm going to Belgium. Good. I'll come with you. CYRIL: But she-- The cost of everything, I know, is high, but the Holiday Inns are offering special concessions this month. But she's flying, and you're afraid of flying. Oh, then I shall pray, and we will stay aloft. [laughs] [music playing] Good morning Mr. Shadey, sir. Oliver. SHADEY: Carl, you're late. You're supposed to be teaching me how to earn an honest living. Let me tell you something. I put 200 quid on that horse and it lost. SHADEY: What horse? You told me it would win six months ago. It was that certain. I said it might win. Please go downstairs. You're frightening me. Winston told me you could pick winners. Now I reckon you owe me something. Honest. To get the money, I had to pull me mum's telly and some clothes. They think I'm a junkie. So how's about a loan? I can't, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just too much money. Get back to work, will you. MAN: Can I offer you a [inaudible]? No. You know he can't even have a bank account till he's been discharged. (ANGRILY) [inaudible] does it? Don't worry, Bubba. I'll find it. For a start, I thought we might thank God for my cure. [laughs] Get down and pray. Kneel. Don't mind the prayers of unbelievers? No, not at all. [sighs] Oh, I am so looking forward to flying. Is she religious as well? [sighs] Fertility. Pray for fertility. Make them fertile. Make them fertile. Make them fertile. Make them fertile. [singing] You know, as soon as she saw this, she grabbed it. "Are you getting engaged?", she said. Once when we were in Singapore, she cut the sleeves off all my father's suits. Why do you wear this ring around your neck? 'Cause it's too small to wear around my finger. [singing] Would you like to come and clean for me, too? You could start tomorrow. Oh. [laughs] I'm going away. There's dirt in very strange places. In the private parts of the statues. [non-english speech] Yes. Oh, I will need references. [bang] Huh, look! [heavy machinery grinding] Do you remember a conversation we had about six months ago, talking about developments in ESP, which the Russians were trying to use? No. CYRIL: That was some film from my source, a bankrupt called Shadey. He seems really willing to me. He's trying to put some money together for a sex change operation. I asked you here because I thought you'd be interested in taking him on-- for a price, obviously. Why me? CYRIL: Because you're the only person in the Secret Service, Dr. Cloud, that uh, that I can trust. Hmm. I hear you're moving offices. DR. CLOUD: That's right. But if he's all that you say he is, why do you want to get rid of him? Well, you know how it is with me. Sell it while it's working to stay ahead. How about a straight swap? Shadey for your old offices. [inaudible] [music playing] [phone rings] Hello. DR. CLOUD (ON PHONE): Dr. Cloud here. Sorry? DR. CLOUD (ON PHONE): Dr. Cloud. No. Don't know any Dr. Clouds. DR. CLOUD (ON PHONE): No, Mr. Shadey. I am Dr. Cloud. Oh, I see. DR. CLOUD (ON PHONE): This just to let you know that from now you'll be working with us for the next few weeks. I assumed I'd be working directly for Sir Cyril. DR. CLOUD (ON PHONE): No, no. You'll be working with us. Well, I must say I am a little surprised. Um, if I am required to do it for extended periods of time, I shall most certainly need medical supervision. DR. CLOUD (ON PHONE): Mr. Shadey, I am a doctor. You are a doctor. Of course you are. Good. DR. CLOUD (ON PHONE): Right. So your first appointment will be the day after tomorrow. Um, if you want to see them, I've got some hours of film that I did here, when I was teaching myself. No state secrets. Just um, pictures of people that I would meet. It might give you an idea of how, um-- DR. CLOUD (ON PHONE): We don't want to see your holiday snaps You need to be absolutely satisfied. We'll have to stick to doing the tests our way. MR. SHADEY: Tests? I don't have to remind you, Mr. Shadey, that people's lives could depend on you. Later on, perhaps, when we have a little more time, it would be most amusing to see what your friends have been up to. Right, I'll see you the day after tomorrow, then. Goodbye. Thank you for calling d-- [music playing] MALE (ON FILM): [laughs] FEMALE (ON FILM): Oh, (SINGING) doo doo-- Oop. [laughs] Whoops. [laughs] Oh. [laughs] Good night, Daddy. [laughs] Can I help you in any way? I can do it all myself. [laughs] [laughs] [giggling] I'm sorry. Well, what do you want now? This is what you've been waiting for for years, isn't it? It's just Giovanna. Why don't we just get it over with? [phone ringing] It's her. Are you going to tell them we're all right? Uh, Constance? They're back. No. No, no. Don't bother to come down. [vomits] Just had a little too much to drink. [inaudible] was great hit at the party, though. Just-- Uh, no, she didn't creep out at all. I kept a very close eye on her all the time. See you in the morning. Goodnight, darling. [music playing] [shout] [music] It makes me want to shout. I just got to shout about it. [inaudible] It really moves me. And I can't sleep. No. [shouts] [music] You know I just can't sleep. No. I just can't sleep. Your love is mine. [static] [music] Your love is mine. No! Get off! Get off me! Help! Get away! Get away! Get away! Get away! [shouts] [inaudible] Stop it. Get away. Get away! [inaudible] Leave her alone! [shouts] Leave, leave her alone, please. [inaudible] It's okay! I'm all right. MALE: Come on! CONSTANCE: Get away! Get away! MALE: Take this [inaudible] way back. Mother! CONSTANCE: (CRYING) Please. [laughter] [inaudible] Jesus Christ, Carol. She's cost me an extra day shooting already with her bloody shenanigans. The whole trouble started, you see, when she had a baby, who died. I think he was a bit odd, you know? I'm sorry. I didn't know the kids were going to upset her. Well, look. We're-- we're in a foreign country. Just tell her the Mongols were a translation error. Look, Mother. This behavior of yours is making us all very, very tense. I don't know how you can do those things in front of those poor children. We've almost finished. Just try and stay behind the camera this time. They took advantage of you. Do you think that I don't know what went on between you? Do you think I'm really that crazy? Why did you sleep with your father? Why did you let him? I didn't. He wanted to because you wouldn't sleep with him. But I didn't. I didn't! Mother, come back! Mother, come back! I didn't! Mother! Come back! I didn't! Come back, Mother! Dick, do something! Mother! [gasping] Lady Landau! Stop immediately! Mother! DICK: Lady Landau! Oh, Dick. Do something. Lady Landau. CAROL: Try and help her, for god's sake! Mother, come back! Lady Landau! [inaudible] CONSTANCE: Eh. [chatter] [crying] Oh, Mother. I'm sorry. I think it's best I take her back to England. I'm sorry. I asked you to come when everyone was taking a break, in case you needed quiet. It's pulling at my hair. I can quite easily hold it. DR. CLOUD: I don't want to see you even touch that until I take the film out. You're not the only one that can do this, you know? There's a man in Toronto who can think pictures of Notre Dame cathedral onto film. Trouble is, he gets the architectural details wrong. You won't be any to us unless you're absolutely infallible. Thank you very much. Now, the acid test will be this. For the purpose of this exercise, my colleague has left a number of objects in the desk drawer of his flat. Can you identify them on the film? I will need the address. It's an area I don't know well. I would need a map. [music playing] DR. CLOUD: Right? [knocking] [film running] [bells] [bugle] [crowd] [gun shots] Welcome aboard, Mr. Shadey. You've been vindicated. MR. SHADEY: Who was that? My colleague, the owner of the flat. He's from the army. Originally. How did you know? I can't have anything to do with that, I'm afraid-- nothing military. I do not approve-- Yes, I want that clearly understood. I saw medals and a gun. DR. CLOUD: It wasn't a real gun. Do you think I'm stupid? No. What do you take me for, then? For me, that kind of work has no truth, no integrity. It would destroy me. Don't worry, Mr. Shadey. We will take care of you. [shouts] I can only use my abilities for peaceful means. [helicopter whirring] [music playing] [panting] You were right. Nobody else has approached you, have they? We've got plenty for you to do. Keep on with your job from them. It's probably the best cover. Cover? If this ever gets out, you'll be hot. I'll see what I can do about getting someone to look after you. [whistling] If you'll excuse me, this isn't my train. [music playing] MALE (ON PHONE): Who is it you wanted? Dr. Cloud. She will be in by 10 o'clock tomorrow. What was it you wanted to hear about? MR. SHADEY: Oh, um, uh, nothing. [buzzing] CAROL (ON PHONE): Yes, what do you want? MR. SHADEY (ON PHONE): Do you know about Sir Cyril? No, what? MR. SHADEY (ON PHONE): What he's done. Have you come to ask for money? MR. SHADEY (ON PHONE): No, It's too late for that. What's this all about? MR. SHADEY (ON PHONE): I don't want to be any trouble. Look, you'd better come in. [buzzer] [music playing] [clanging] [door slam] This is my mother, Lady Landau. Mother, this is-- Shadey. Oliver Shadey. He's something to do with father. Oh. high finance. She's troubled. So, what's this all about? I encouraged your father's involvement in a scheme. He got me into something, and sold me. How could he do that? To the army, you know. I am now obliged to spy. My whole life has become a complete shitty mess with everything in it I dislike most. Everybody takes advantage or attacks me for it. If they carry on, they're going to kill the goose that lays the golden egg. What are they doing to you? They have made me into an investigator. They have destroyed my telephone. When it's dark, I'm afraid to go out. [mumbles] How-- how am I-- how am I going to call for help if they've torn up my telephone? [sighs] I-- I don't know. I suppose Carl might have done the telephone on his own. Who's Carl? He forced me to give him a racing tip. I didn't want to do it, so I looked sideways, and he lost a lot of money. Still, what's the use of complaining, eh? Worse things have happened, and in this house. What's more, I've witnessed them. If you don't believe me, I can show you the film. What do you mean? Your mother will wear you out if you let her. You'd be much better off sending her to a home. Wow, she's crazy. Is that all you wanted to say? No. Maybe some other time. Lady Landau, good night. [music playing] When did you first find out about your abilities? A long time ago. It-- it's very exhausting. What happened to your hand? Um, a booby trap. - We don't want to lose you. You could be very valuable to us. Uh, uh, uh-- When I first approached Sir Cyril, it was with the intention of obtaining enough money for an operation. Why on earth do you want to be a woman? Because I already am. What was that for? DR. CLOUD: A little something to make you relax. Not your favorite subject, I'm afraid. No. No. No. I won't. The island has enemies, Shadey. We must be wily, like them. And Captain Amies will guide you through the maps. But I'm afraid I have to hurry this one along, to catch you in your own [inaudible]. But I managed to put a batch of stuff together. What do you mean? DR. CLOUD: I can best explain this by analogy, hmm? My father, a quarter Indian, found himself at the Battle of Lewes, urging his men over the top with ancient Urdu battle cries. Now afterwards he couldn't speak a word of it till the day he died. Now they found that chaps who developed extraordinary skills, such as yours, did so in response to certain situations. And when situations passed, the skill vanished. Now I expect you will be exactly like those chaps, if you ever get what you want. But Sir Cyril promised me. CAPTAIN AMIES: What went on between you and Sir Cyril's got nothing to do with us. He traded you to us, sight unseen, for two floors of offices in Whitehall. MR. SHAPEY: But I-- sir-- that-- that shouldn't be no-- wa-- CAPTAIN AMIES: What? Sorry. No more war. Ah. Now, this is the latest Russian submarine. Carries 80 warheads, but we need more details. Now this is the main dock for those submarines in the Baltic. Start here. Can you see any submarines? Good. Off we go. [music playing] MAN (ON FILM): [non english speech] [non-english speech] [music playing] CAPTAIN AMIES: We've got a little Joe here. FEMALE: OK, Dick we're running. DICK: OK. FEMALE: Donly video promo, slate 14, take five. Action. [moaning] DR. CLOUD: Sounds like you have [inaudible] shooting. DICK: Yeah, that's right. I'm still working. DICK (ON PHONE): Well, I offer you a ridiculous amount of money to film a second '''''' promo. CAROL (ON PHONE): [inaudible] Yeah, apparently some of the Japanese fans want to see-- DIRECTOR: Cut! DICK (ON PHONE): --other aspects of their idols' lives. So I said OK, I'll do it. CAROL (ON PHONE): That's very noble of you. DICK: Well, I wanted to buy you a diamond ring. Monsieur-- CAROL (ON PHONE): Buy me the diamond ball. It's impossible. There are too many people here. Could we not do this somewhere else? No. Look, they'll give you a copy of that to play on the hotel video. CAROL (ON PHONE): [laughs] I've been thinking. I've made a decision. [DICK (ON PHONE): How? CAROL: To get my mother a nurse. DICK (ON PHONE): And we should. CAROL: Oh, fine. Very well. [laughs] DICK (ON PHONE): I bet she can't even bear to hear my name. She hasn't mentioned you once. [laughs] DICK (ON PHONE): I don't mind that. I'd be more upset if you hadn't been thinking about me. 'Course I've been thinking about you. Uh. You didn't catch cold, did you? DICK (ON PHONE): No, but I tell you, the crew had been really [inaudible] after that, but for the rest of the day [inaudible]. Oh yeah, there are some really, really nice stones here. CAROL (ON PHONE): You can't be serious. I am serious. This is an emotional investment. CAROL (ON PHONE): Daddy says fake diamonds are flooding the market. Are any of these synthetics? No, Monsieur. CAROL (ON PHONE): Look, it's-- Monsieur. CAROL (ON PHONE): extremely generous of you, but could I just think about it? DICK (ON PHONE): All right. I can make you a star. CONSTANCE: Mm. [chewing] DICK (ON PHONE): You have a beautiful body. LADY LANDAU: Mm-hmm. CAROL: Yes, but-- but you're not serious. DICK (ON PHONE): I'll see you when I get back. [laughs] All right. LADY LANDAU: Mm. But I don't want a ring. LADY LANDAU: [muttering] DICK (ON PHONE): [inaudible] diamonds but [inaudible] Just because the ring fitted my finger, it does not mean that we are going to get-- DICK (ON PHONE): What doesn't it mean? [knocking] MAN: [inaudible] MAN BEHIND DOOR: Who is it? [speaking french] DICK: What's so funny your end? I get a little lonely without you. Getting a little lonely without you. [crashing] OFFICER: Ooh. MAID: [screaming] [non-english speech] Carol, think I'm going to have to call you back. [screaming] [crying] MAN: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH MAID: [inaudible] Oh my god. You're meant to be looking after her, and you let her eat coal, again? OLIVER: It's nice to be up early. I love the dawn. My mother used to say I was lazy, but that's not true, though I never got a taste for it until now. Where are we going? We're taking you home, Oliver. OLIVER: I need to get away to change a little, to move to a different part of the human race. There's a girl I once saw on a calendar. My destiny is to be with her. [crash] Huh? Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. I just wanted to know where you lived. Well, come. So why did you come really? You know you said you'd show me some film? Will you show it to me? I never thought you'd be his daughter. I think I have a right to see it, don't you? [video playback] [projector running] [purring] [end playback] [slurping] Were you going to blackmail my father with that? No. I didn't know him from Adam. Coercion is not my style. Seriously, though, I would rather be liked by you than um-- Oh? Why? Personal reasons. You better have this. I'm not protected. You see, when I first started, I used to get all sorts of things-- images, strangers, interference. I had difficulty cleaning my mind. You don't have to be polite. I wasn't. But when I first started, it wasn't exact. This could have been a wish or a dream. They're not looking after you. It's true. They're very careless. I got a marriage proposal the other day. Yes, you did. My mother got wind of it and has already ordered a candy striped marquis. Daddy says he's a bounty hunter. Can I get anything for you? A gun or a revolver perhaps? Oh, don't trouble yourself. Everything we need comes to us. Well, it could be a matter of life and death once anyone gets to hear of you. Have you got your mother on mind again? At last. So you're free. That's right. Look after yourself. You should go back to bed. All right. [car starting] FEMALE ON INTERCOM: Here in store, last-minute shoppers, today's special offers can be found at the frozen food counters. That's big savings in frozen foods, today only. So hurry to the frozen foods now. Big savings, today only. Thank you. My daughter is getting married. She's a lovely girl. She'll settle down nicely. We don't have enough money for all that fish. But there'll be lots of people. Mr. Landau said the catering firm will be taking care of that. Oh, but this is nothing. My father put in his hand and pulled out what he liked. He owned the fish farm, he said. You won't tell anyone I said that, will you? Tell them what? It's meant to be a secret. What is? It would break the spirit of our agreement if I were to gossip. [camera click] I have a fever. I've left my car in the next street. I can't bring it any closer. Security. Come on. [camera clicks] Just before we start, I would like to raise the issue of payment, the issue of money. Oh, well, you're being paid all right, the same level as a clerical assistant, 67 pounds a week. Wha-- I'll never be able to get the money together that way. Don't worry. Don't worry? I have a bankruptcy hearing in three weeks. Ah, well, we've taken care of all that. It's being indefinitely postponed. Yes, but-- I'm sorry. I-- I have to leave the country for an operation. Oh, yes. You've got to go to Morocco. Algeria. Now, I um, I don't have a passport. We have a department which looks after all the details. Come on. Get in. [muffled protests] What? [muffled protests] [slicing noise] [groaning] [rattling] Sir Cyril is all right, is he? Perfectly. I've just spoken to him on the telephone. Uh, what was it? Oh, simple. He feels resentful towards Sir Cyril because things haven't turned out immediately for him. He was seeing a revenge fantasy where the protagonist is masked in order to hide his own part. Ah. I think-- I see. I mean, Shadey's own desire for sexual translation is a reaction against his subconscious desire for [inaudible]. He doesn't like feeling vengeful. Sir Cyril stands for his father. His father was deaf for his desires. So he gets his ears chopped off. There's only one way past this block, and that is to get him to talk Cyril face to face. Do you think you could sneak him into the engagement party? Ah. [laughter] [clanging] Forgot my tools. They're not yours. Don't rush off. [inaudible] down at the hospital. I'm delighted for you. But I'm-- I have to go. Got any money for me? Don't come around here again, all right? All right, t-- take whatever tools and materials you want. Just um, just go. [clang] [scream] I'll get you, you little queer. [non-english] Donly, our up-and-coming son-in-law, please meet two of my old roommates, Pinky and Slocum. Very please to meet you, sir. Nice to meet you. One is the bishop with Ipswich. The other was Minister for Nuclear Power. Now, which was which? I suppose nowadays it matters much. Hardly. Let me show you upstairs. Thank you, young man. Why don't you go and get dressed? We're down in a minute. Carol, are you sure you want to go through with this? Hmm? Look, why don't you go down and get me a drink. One glass of wine. No, a glass of brandy. My stomach feels terrible. One glass of wine. That's all I'm allowed. Ha ha. PAUL SHULMAN: Dr. Cloud. My name's Shulman-- Paul Shulman. I'm attached to the South African Embassy. What are you doing here? Well, the Ambassador and his wife are here. And you? Oh, I run a small-- Psychic research unit. I know. I hear you have some very interesting new developments. Could we borrow it? We pay very well. No. He's not for sale. You're on your own, bud. [music playing] Nice do. Wished I'd brought the wife with me now, except she-- she tries to drag me from the drinks tray. We used to go to some fuckados. Do you know we haven't had sex for 15 years? I wonder if they have the same problem in Russia? You have a very lovely daughter, you know. Would you speak to him? I think just a few words would help. Right. Did you agree to give him the operation? That's our trump card. We're holding onto that one. Probably very wise. When he gets what he wants, he'll stop. I don't blame him for getting annoyed. Everybody wants a turn with the new toy. - Can't you stop them? - I wish I could. What scares me is that I think we're only scratching the surface of his abilities. PHOTOGRAPHER: Around we come, around we come. Look to your left now. Now to your right. [crowd chatter] Is that their source? We've had them covered for some time. Don't [inaudible]. Here she comes. [crowd chatter] Come on. Carol, Carol, to me. After me. Perfect. Little more light over here, [inaudible]. Yeah. [crowd chatter] Just turn. Give us a big twirl. Yeah. [crowd chatter] OLIVER: Shut the door. Shut the door. Lock it. [lock clicking] Ah OLIVER: What's the matter? Does nobody want you? [slurp] [water running] OLIVER: You've been unfortunate. I can tell. Every day's a burden, isn't it? Hand over hand up the barren hill to the told evening. Poor Constance. Life's a battle, isn't it? One which you've lost. And there's almost nothing you can do about it. You were born out of a cracked egg. It dropped straight out of the hen's ass onto a concrete floor. And nobody's ever loved you, have they? Stop it, please. When your husband put his hand on the doorknob of your daughter's room, you hoped that he was doing something nasty to her so that they wouldn't leave you with all that nasty spoiling inside you. You were sorry for being nasty inside, but in the end, they didn't care. Nobody cares that you are a mean-spirited little screwed up snob who only married Cyril because you knew that one day he'd do for your daughter in just the same way as your father did for you. Come on. You have got all the money you want. And you're still mean and miserable. And one day a little gray starling is going to tap tap tap on the window, and you're going to look up and that's going to be it. That is going to be the end of your life. Mm. Mm. [heavy breathing] Aaah. [knock on door] Connie [knock on door] Connie. [knock on door] Connie, we're waiting for you. Connie. [knock on door] Connie. Open the door. Connie, open the door. Connie [banging on door] Connie. Connie, we're waiting for you. [banging on door] Connie. Connie. You bastard. Connie, open the door. [banging on door] Connie, come on. Come on, open the door. [banging on door] Connie. [banging on door] There we go. Connie, what did-- what do you-- where were you? Dr. Cloud. Now what's going on? We're all waiting. Oh, I'm so sorry. He tormented me. Have you ever seriously considered the idea, Bishop, that Christ was, uh, might have, uh, well had homosexual tendencies and that God created man for his own amusement? Why did God only show Moses his nether parts? And when Christ says to Satan get thee behind me, is this an invitation to an unnatural act? What's that? Blood? Someone cut themselves helping my wife chop onions. I don't smell onions. I wasn't expecting to be on duty tonight. Your questions obviously spring from a sincere doubt. Doubt is the enemy of faith. The only remedy, if you find you have doubt, is to fight it. I find your interest in our Saviour. Jesus Christ. Our Lord, quite-- [siren] Ah, shit. [door closing] He's not eating, you know. Yes, well, that's a normal reaction to shock. I knew it was asking for trouble, parading him in the open like that. Are you going to run tests? Not until she's gone. Do you think that he can read people's minds as well? I don't know. He's starting to give me the creeps. He didn't plan to have his testicles severed, did he? Oh, for God's sake, don't tell him he's lost them. It's ridiculous to think that Lady Landau could have been acting under his influence, isn't it? Yes. Dickens ridiculous. Did it hurt? No. No. I'm just sorry to have spoiled your engagement party. Thank you for staying with me so long. They said I'd have to clear with security if I wanted to come and see you again. Well, yes. Secrets. Goodbye, Carol. Goodbye, Shadey. A strong dollar has meant a great deal to me financially, of course. But look, Sir Cyril, don't get me wrong. What I'm after is a guarantee against-- well, loss against venture capital. I don't want your money. I don't have much to do with entertainment or film. I can't understand it. Well, I could teach you. The Russians. The Russians aren't going to harm us. The Russians want to live as much as we do. Where did Carol go? Ah. I don't know. Tell me, um, are there any other men in her life? You understand what I mean? Well, she went out somewhere last night, uh, with Shadey. I don't know about her other experiences. Shadey, eh? We have enough nuclear devices to kill everybody 50,000 times. You know what upsets me about the whole business of last night? That I traded Shadey to the defense people for so little. I missed a major opportunity. Does he ever record the future? As far as I can understand, he tries to avoid it. Sometimes he can't. He's a con artist. I think you did well getting rid of him at any price. You know he lost his, uh, manhood last night. What do you mean? So Carol's safe? Sir Cyril, allow me to buy an ice cream. Uh, no. No, thank you. I insist. All right. Just a little one. What authority [inaudible]. [crowd chatter] Except to move you in the direction of yearning for a better life. [humming] [screaming] [glass shattering] [screaming] Had the family received any threatening letters before the kidnapping? I don't know. Not that I know of, but it's not the sort of thing my father would tell us anyway. He wouldn't tell you about letters threatening his life? No. He'd want to protect us. I mean, protect my mother's feelings. You hold these men responsible for the state of your mother's mind now? Well, of course. I mean, it hasn't been easy living through these past few days. I mean, my mother's in a home. What are your feelings towards these ter-- terrorists? What-- how do you feel about them? If they could hear you now, what would you say to them? Do you hate them? Oh, I-- I don't know. I just want to see my father again. That's what I would say to them, whoever they are, wherever they are. I just want to see my father. Well, now, Mr. Shadey, we've had three sessions since your accident. And each time the film has been developed, it's been blank. What if it were a matter of life and death? It looks as though your prediction about Sir Cyril has come true. He's been kidnapped, and they want five million pounds not to kill him. No one knows where he is, and I've been asked to ask you if you felt strong enough to help. No, I don't feel strong enough. Oh. Well, you didn't mind my asking, did you? There's no need for you to worry about your bankruptcy, because for security sake, we'll need to have a change of identity for you. I already have one. Yes, of course. Well, I've got to do some shopping for you. Is it too dangerous for me to go out? Yes, yes. It's far too dangerous. Don't worry. We'll take care of you. Anytime she says that, something awful happens. If I had a change of scene, I might feel stronger. I could try looking for Sir Cyril after I've been out to a restaurant, say. Somewhere rather exotic. Otherwise, any film I do will just be blank when you develop it. You know, I've sent the engagement video home already. I don't want to look like a complete bloody fool, you know. It's just that I don't know if it's what I want. That's all. I always feel that there's too much going on in my life at the moment to have a relationship. You have a relationship with Shadey, don't you? No. What the bloody hell does he do for you then? Three Mulligatawny soups, one [inaudible] korma, two Rogan josh, vegetable biryani, pilaf rice, mango pickle, lime pickle, and shredded coconut. Um, five plain poppadoms 10 spicy. Uh, lamb dhansak, Bombay aloo, the beef tindaloo, um, a butter chicken, a mutton tikka, a mushroom bhaji, a cucumber raita, kashmiri raita, dal. Um, one glass of lassi. Um, two pints of lager, and one white wine. Um, One prawns with spinach, four naan, two stuffed parathas, one plain parathas. Um, chapatis all around. They have tandoori, right. Tandoori royal lobster. We'll have a whole one. Onion bhaji and something light-- oh, um, a lamb pasanda. Sure you can-- can eat all that? [kick] Oof. And some ladies fingers for me, please. Will you, um, will you excuse me, Oliver? I expect we'll be asleep by the time you get back. Good night, Dr. Cloud. Tests again then? Tomorrow? Hmm? Uh, Captain Amies? Ahem. Um, if he wants anything, let him have it. Otherwise, he'll only find a way of taking it. Goodbye, Oliver. Night now. Oh, no. Cloud thinks a lot of you. I don't. I taught at a boy's school once. Coached the cricket first 11th. There was a boy there who never [inaudible] never do any good. Suddenly he learned to bowl of perfect inswinger. Halfway through the season, his touch vanished. Heh. Became completely ordinary. I don't feel I'm losing my touch in the least. All my life, I've sought and found obscurity until now. Ask of me anything you like. All right. Ha, what is death? Are you sure that's a question you want answered? Yes. Well-- Ah aah. [footsteps] Help me. [dramatic music] [explosion] [alarm] [coughing] Jesus Christ. [inaudible] He can't have. [birds chirping] There's a lovely couple on the water. Boating. Can-- can't I stay and watch the couple? [ducks quacking] [lady giggling] One of them looks for all the world like Carol, like my daughter. [lady giggling] [music playing]
