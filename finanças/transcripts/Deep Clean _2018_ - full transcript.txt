Three bacon sarnies and three teas. Be a good lad. What's he doing here? He knocked some kid out. They were gonna stick him back in that place. I don't want him here any more than you do. Why then? He needed some kind of work placement. Alright, I'm just saying, this is not a good idea. He's my brother's kid Malky. He'll be up top, it'll be fine. Shit. That's not good. Says there's something still moving down there. Going down there then? Yeah, get your shit together. Alright Al! Listen, we gotta go down below, sort something out. Where'd you get those goggles?

This ingenious little bastard was attempting to build itself a body. Look at that! What is it? It's an inter-dimensional something or other. We call'em ‘fucktards'. Cheers Al. You just saved my ass. Ha! Just like your dad did on numerous occasions. Dad did this? Yeah. Where's it from? Dunno. All I know is, they come through, and we block em up. They come through? Yeah. It's quite nice this one. No fucking way. Sort of peaceful. But what's through there? Fuck knows mate - not our department. Charming! Right let's block this bastard up. Go upstairs and get the gear. Stick the kettle on while you're up there. These are shit by the way. Bet Crew 9 wouldn't have to deal with this. That's pretty good. Don't worry. I won't show anyone. No one'd believe you anyway. Unbelievable! You're still not doing anything! What do you actually do? You see the thing is... We're on a break. You're a bit quite Malky. You alright? Yeah, course.
