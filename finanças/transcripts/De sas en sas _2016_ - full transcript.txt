Temperatures are slowly dropping in the West... Warm holidays under the heat wave... We didn't steep well, it was the hottest night. Indeed, since the heat wave has started... - Nora. - Yes? Leave it, I'll do it later. Mom, I'm not taking the meat, It's going to go bad with the heat. - You didn't forget anything? - No. - Are you sure? - Oh, my toilet bag. Don't forget to buy some water. Ok. Will you pass home again? No, I'm going back to my place. - Don't you want some help? - Don't worry, I'm fine. - Here. - No, Dad. Thank you. I'll call you tomorrow. Kisses. Group for the 2:15pm visit, please go to the entrance. Group for the 2:15pm visit, please go to the entrance. Go, please. Are you hiding something? No sir, I've got nothing, I swear. Relax, I'm just kidding. Please put your bag on the carpet. Yes, sorry. Thank you. Move out of the way, please. Yes sir. You put this on all at once? - It depends on what I wear. - It's so beautiful! - Keep it. It's yours. - Really? Thanks. - I'm sorry. - You do realize what time it is? We'll take care of that later. What a nightmare! She's pregnant, she can't remain standing. She says she's not thirsty. She seems patient. You better be patient. Did you see her womb? She's about to deliver. I'm leaving for the weekend tomorrow. Yeah, with some friends. A house in the country, with some friends. We're a whole group. Just a little bit... - When you get to the visiting room... - The dress I got myself! Coulibaly, C-O-U-L-I-B-A-L-Y. You are not on the list Madam, I swear. I'm not crazy. I have an appointment today. I asked for a day off. - You must be mistaken. - I know what I'm saying. - So now you're going to let me in. - I'm sorry, I can't. I didn't come here for nothing. I have an appointment. I have an appointment for the 2:15pm visit. - You're wasting my time, call your boss. - You are not on the list. - Let me in. - Please calm down, I can't let you in. - But you, who are you? - Come on Madam, relax please. Please let me in! She says she has an appointment, but she's not on the list. There's no use acting like this. Go back home, and call for another appointment. I will not leave until I see my husband. She thinks that something happened to him. - Go back in, she'll calm down. - I can't leave her like that. Landing! - Something is going on outside... - It's nothing. Can you keep your kid with you please? Lola, stop! Come on. - That's the shortest I found. - You still haven't put it on. No, I keep it for next time. - But you are taking it with you? - You'll see on the pictures. This is not a playground. Would you stop? Easy, she's just a kid! - Just keep her with you. - Asshole. Excuse me? - Did you say something? - My mother said you are a little mole. Did he hurt you? Come on, let's go! Go first, you're pregnant! Houria, you've got a Kleenex? Here you go, sweetheart. Give me another one, please. - Are you going to do this every week? - Mom, can I have a Kleenex please? Houria, do you have some shrink-wrap left? Shrink-wrap, Kleenex... Am I a grocery store? Excuse me, would you have some change? Excuse me, would you have some change? Sorry Madam, I have some and I keep it. Mommy? - You want to pee? - No. - Stay outside, then. - But I want to come with you. No, go play with Nora. Nora, can you stay with the kid? Come, Lola. Sorry, would you have change for 5 euros? No, I'm sorry, I don't have any. What are you looking for? - I need some coins for the locker. - Oh, just this. - Do you have some? - Yeah. - Here you go. - No, you're going to need it too. Don't worry, I'll survive. Take it. - Thanks. I don't know how to thank you. - You're welcome. Don't take this one. The surveillance camera doesn't see it. There's been some thefts. Last time, they stole Judith's phone. - Really? - Yeah. - Thanks. - No worries. By the way, my name is Marlene. - You? - Nora. But don't be so formal with me. Ok! Down by the river with the hanky panky... Stop pressuring me like that. I can't talk to you right now. I'll call you when I leave. Hurry "P! It's ok, I'm done. - Are you ok Judith? - Yes, I'm ok. - Are you sure? - Yes. - You don't look like it. - It's ok, I must have had food poisoning. Down by the river with the hanky panky... Farida, you've got some party-liners? - Tampons, if you want! - Tampons don't go there. Mommy, are you making a wish? Yes, honey. Come on, let's cool off. - Excuse me. - This one doesn't work. - I just want toilet paper. - There isn't any. Alright, you're getting used to it? Yes. It's different than Fresnes. - You did your internship there? - Yes. I worked there for 5 years. Which department were you in? Preventive. - Sorry? - Preventive. - You must have crossed Serge, then. - Yes. - You know about it? - Yes. That was intense. Yet it didn't surprise me. Nawell! Hurry up. Carry this, I don't have any room left. It's a chocolate bar. Nabil loves this. Where are you going to put this? Remember what I told you earlier. Don't put shame on me. He needs us. I'm counting on you. Come on, Farida. I'm coming. Let's put some colors on you. You look like a ghost. You're white. Let's add some colors, you're going to scare Nabil. I don't like makeup. You're smoking... Can't you see she's pregnant? Smoke won't do anything to her, with what she breathes in her tent under a bridge! You're insane. Do you hear yourself talk? Bullshit. Don't worry. I'm watching. Nora, you've got one euro? - Sorry, I have nothing left. - Fuck. Nora, come here please. What for? Mommy, can I have Jim? - Not now Lola, please. - Mommy! Thank you. Mommy... - Can I have Jim? - Thank you sweetie. I'm sorry. Thank you. Not bad, uh? I give her 8110. If you say so. We can tell you've just arrived. You won't see a lot of these. Let me put you some perfume on. No, it's going to go bad with the heat. Have you ever seen Chanel go bad? Come see how pretty you are. Isn't that better? Yes? Ok, chief. Hurry, please. Don't come complain if you miss your 30mn visit. Farida, stop drinking like a camel, you won't be able to pee. Leave me alone. As soon as they open, run or we won't have any room. Yes, I know. I don't understand, it doesn't work. Try again. It doesn't work. Try again slowly. Sorry, sir. Hello. I don't have a card to take appointments. You have to get one at the entrance. - What do I do now then? - I'll take care of it. - What day do you want? - The 27th. It's full on the 27th. - Are you sure? - Yes, I have no more room. Damn. That's the only day off I have. I got it. Now I can make my season with swimming suits. I'll not only sell lingerie, also swimming suits. Ah, great. I have awesome stuff. - Be more gentle with the keys. - It's ok. Go ahead, do it. Try talking to your employer. And call again for an appointment. It's the best I have. Couldn't we negotiate something? Call between 10 and 12, it will be cheaper. - Is it your first time here? - Yes. - And you're visiting your family? - In a way, yes. Sorry, do your terminals only work half the time? - Is it the Middle Ages here? - I know, that's why I'm here. One second. - Is everything clear? - Yes. Thank you. Goodbye. - Sorry, where do I go now? - To the laundry. - What day for the appointment? - Mom? Come here. - Are you coming Thursday? - Yes. Thursday for my mother. - Your name? - Fatma Douad. - Alright. - And for me, in one month. - One month is too far ahead. - How come? That's the way it is. You have to call. But calling is a disaster! You're a newcomer. Signature, please. - Beat it. It's not working. - We never know. You thought you were smarter. Come on, I'm watching you. We always get screwed here. I'm sorry Miss. Goodbye. What's wrong with you? Are you going to spend your life hugging the walls? - When did you ask your days off fol'? - From the 12th till the 28th. Thank you. You're going to Tunisia? - Why there? It's not hot enough here? - I'm looking for some fresh air. That's it. The sea, the sun. But this year I'm only taking the children. Really? Why? - Their mother and I broke up. - Shit. - Why didn't you tell me? - It's going well. - How long has it been? - One month. - And you are ok with it? - Yes, it's alright. Come here Lola. - Where are we going? - To the laundry. - You're not taking an appointment? - Don't worry, I'll call. - How are you, newcomer? - I'm ok. - Not too hard? - No, it's just too hot here. Don't complain, It's 3 degrees cooler here. - They can't take it in section B. - I imagine. Come here. I'm not going to eat you! That's not so sure! - I'd like some too! - No Madam, for the staff only. See the bitch? - Hello, Jean-Michel. - Hello, Madam. ID number, please. 54-490. He does as if he didn't know me. I'm not taking this. Come on, we're neighbors, don't act like you don't know me. Whatever, there is no privilege. Do you know how long I've been coming here? Never had any problem. Now, you're going to look for trouble? - That's the way it is. - What do you think he's going to do with it? Suicide is forbidden for us. That's the way it is, Mrs. Jidali. It's a rule. I am the civil servant, I just do my job. And your bike blocking the stairway? Do I say anything? - Do I come up with the co-ownership rules? - It has nothing to do with that! Come on, we can't wait forever. Let it pass, please. You can take it back when you exit, Madam. Asshole. Mrs Jidali! Signature, please. - We'll see each other again, you know. - Have a nice day, Mrs Jidali. - What happened? - Nabil's belt. He didn't let it pass. Thank you. 56-234. - It's not too hard with the heat? - Just like for you. I heard It's going to last for the whole week. Yes, I heard that too. - Are you leaving for holidays? - Yes, next week. Oh, good. Change of scene. - â€œMere are you going? - To Brittany. I heard it's nice there. - Do you speak a little English? - So embarrassing. - Do you think this moron speaks English? - Bilingual illiterate, you know? Signature, Madam. - Anyway, I wish you a nice holiday. - Thank you, Madam. Shall we go, Mom? What? What is it? 38-215. Sorry? My son is in jail. Isn't that enough? - I don't need that. - That's how you thank me? You think I enjoy wasting my time here? So seeing your brother is a waste of time. - You know I'm making efforts. - What efforts? Last time, you didn't say a word. He was talking to you and you didn't care. You think It's easy for him? All he has is us. I do what I can. - Do you? - Yes, I do. How long since your last visit? Two months. You're just like your father, I can't count on you. Everything I did, I did it for you. Don't waste your time with your family. He doesn't need a sister like that. And I don't need you either. Hello. Thank you. You never answer when I call you. Are you playing hide-and-seek? Come on, sweetie. Have a seat Houria. No, if I sit I get angry. - You're sure? - No thanks. It's so hot, my feet are all swollen. - Like potatoes! - You see, you don't listen. I told you to take your Scholl, but you never want to. I'm not a Grandma! Let's ask the college boy for a massage. He's cute... Look how red he is! He's red like a tomato! He's all red! Like my t-shin! Poor guy- Leave him alone. You know what a woman is? I'm going to tell you. A woman doesn't complain, she keeps quiet. See, now you're not a woman. I don't even want to argue! It's pathetic. Sometimes, Houria... There's no use. - Farida, would you massage my feet? - Anything else? Lemon sorbet. When we get out, we'll get some ice-cream. - Mommy, I'm hot... - I know, sweetie. We'll visit Margot on the way to get the homework. - What did you do at school this morning? - We learned a poem. Nice. Do you want to recite it for me? - No. - Why not? It's for Daddy. Nora, can we play Down by the River again? No Lola. Leave me alone, I'm tired. - Come on, please. - No, I tell you I'm tired. - At what time do you start? - 6am. - How do you do with the kid? - I ask a neighbor. I'm here on Saturdays, but you can come on Sundays if you want. - Mommy, I'm thirsty. - Wait until we get to the other side. - But I'm thirsty. - Well, stop running everywhere then. Could we have some water please? I'm sorry, I can't do anything for you. - But I'm thirsty! - You will drink in the next room. Beat it, Fatma. There's no point. Are you ok? Yes. You cried? Are you sulking? No, not at all. Are you crazy or what? Your daughter rules. She's being difficult right now. - It's normal, this place is not for her. - Well I agree. I struggle for her, and all she has to say is: Daddy. - Normal, he's her father. She misses him. - Yeah, but it's a pain in the ass. She'll get over it. Anyway, It's over, I don't want to see him anymore. What? It's over. I'm sick of it. - This is the last time I come here. - Are you serious? What about Lola? She will forget. But you can't do that to her, he's her father! I don't want to tell my life story here. A father? He doesn't give a damn. What do you know? He needs her. If he had any interest in her, do you think he would have messed around? Anyway, who are you to tell me that? What does that imply? When is the last time you visited your brother? Isn't that what Fatma was reproaching you? It's something else. My brother and I haven't shared anything for years! He's made my parents suffer since we were kids. - I'm big, I do what I want. - Big? On top of your 20 years? What do you know about life? If you don't want to see your man, it's your problem, not Lola's. Anyway, it's none of my business. I say this for her. Hey, your feet. - What's the difference? This place is filthy. - Still. It wouldn't be bad for her to forget about jail. Whether he's in or out, he's ruining her life. But I can't say anything to her. Every time I open my mouth, she starts yelling. Normal, it's her son. Yes? I'm sorry, sir. I'm not the ideal Prince Charming. Were you asleep? She's second-hand, find yourself another one! It's easy to insult people when they can't understand. - Come on, can't we just have fun? - It's really fun indeed. Come on. Champion of the poors... She sure does look for trouble. Plus we're kidding, no harm done. - What did she say about me? - Whatever, beat it. Not now, sit down. I can't believe it. You're fooling us. Mommy, why aren't we going? Sit down, relax. You should never have woken her up. - This time It's for good. - At last! Move, sweetheart. This heat... Come on. Sonia, the jacket, please. What did you hide again, Sonia? - Anthony is not going to let you pass. - You think? Your belt. What's wrong with you, are you bored or what? Hey, girls, I think he's bored today. Keep going. Really? Careful, I'm not going to stop. Do you like it? I'm going to get Nathalie for a body search. Ok Sonia, you can go. What a whore. She might have her reasons. People do their best. You went a little far this time. Go get the bench in the shade. Come on, run! Mommy, there's no more water! Anthony, can you change the water bottle, please? - I'll take care of it, Madam. - Thank you. - You don't want to sit in the shade? - It'll be alright. - How long are we going to stay here? - We're waiting for the prisoners. - How long is it going to be? - Fifteen, twenty minutes. It's so hot in here. No answer. Should I go? Don't ever do this to me again. - What? - You know very well, I'm not stupid. You could regret it. What does that mean? I'm just following the rules. The rules, you know what it is? Some bullshit written by pen-pushers who never moved their asses off of their chairs. Never left their office to see what is really going on. I've been here for 25 years, I know what I'm talking about. I've seen guys screwing themselves up. What about them? Don't expect them to be nice with you. They don't give a shit. Don't ever forget you're in a uniform. You can't get rid of that. If you don't make yourself respected, they'll eat you. I say this for you. Personally, I don't care. I'll be out in two years. - So don't spoil my life, are we clear? - Yes, we're clear. If you expected to do some social care, you're in the wrong place. I'm going to get the water bottle. You like my ring? Come on, I'm not going to eat you. You like jewelry? Yes. When you're big, your husband will give you plenty of them. I don't want to get married. Well, no husband, no jewelry! Wait until you grow up, it'll change. Stop, be quiet! I'm joking. I don't care, I have this. What a nice lipstick. Aren't you cute! And it's a magic one, too. Lola! That's not mine. Come here, where did you find this? Did you stole it? - No, it's a gift! - Are you kidding me? Stop! I'm the one who gave it to her. Mind your own business. I raise my daughter the way I want. Be silent! Now stay calm. One more stupid thing and I leave you here. You may as well punish me, this way I'll stay with Daddy. I hate you. I'll tell Daddy. You want to play a game? Come on, give me your hand. Thank God your mother is here. Come on, don't be ridiculous. Do you think I haven't been yelled at? In Arab. Your veil makes me sweat, don't you want to take it off? Hey, can't she take it off? Well I'm not forcing her, she does what she wants. I couldn't wear this. Nobody asks you to! I guess you must gain time in the bathroom. Mind your own business. It highlights her pretty eyes. People also look at me in the eyes. It's not possible, we can't stay here without water! Excuse me. We cannot stay like that without water. My colleague is taking care of it. - But when? We're dying here. - I just told you, it's coming. They are right. We can't take it anymore! We're not as sexy as Sonia, but we'd like to have some privileges too! How about a little striptease? You want me to turn you on? Go back to your seats or I cancel your visits. - Are you fucking kidding me? - Not at all. - Take me for an idiot. - Sonia, stop. Be careful, or I'll give you one. Shut your mouth! Sonia! Come sit. Come on, can't we just have fun? You'll have me to contend with. Calm down, ok? Come on, sit down. What is that? You motherfucker! - What is going on? - I don't know, sweetheart. - What is it we hear? - I don't know. Is it the prisoners? - Weird... - No, it's nothing. Just another mad one who didn't take his medication. Put me down, please. - Do you see anything? - Nothing. Let me go, I have heels. Come down, sweetie. No, I want to stay here. I heard Daddy. - What are you talking about? - I swear to you! - It's not possible, come down. - But I heard his voice! I can't see anything. - We wouldn't be here if something was wrong. - You're right. Nawell, come on. The TV works now. It's the show I love. Mom, have a seat. I have a bad feeling. - Don't stay in the sun. - Leave me alone. Who are you visiting? I came here to see my Daddy. He did stupid things when I was a baby. You know, It's my birthday soon. I think I'm still going to invite him though. God, they've scared us! See, I told you it was nothing. How can you watch this? It's wonderful, everyday it's different. You have one who tells about her husband, her lover... - Her kids, drugs... a lot of stuff. - Don't you get bored? You learn a ton of stuff! She's the best. She's so good she's been on TV for 20 years! They haven't fired her. Yeah, it's written on her face. I love her! Still so young, I don't know how she does. She really has no trouble. Unlike us. Stop watching this shit. So, how is the wedding going? We're just waiting for the exit permit. But these dogs never let you know. Yet when the door rings, I swear to you... my heart beats so... it makes me crazy. - Don't worry. It'll be alright. - Plus we're here to help you! Frankly, it's not easy. Nothing is ready besides Nawell's gowns. Hey gins, they brought us some water! It's about time! We're dying. Clear the gate. You want the bottle? You clear the gate. Come on, go bring it in. Give me a glass. Here you go, honey. Careful, there's the kid! Please, tell me what's going on. You can't say anything, is that it? Come with me, it's getting tense out there. You stay here. If anything happens, let me know. Do not cross the gate. Understood. Hey, girls! Sprayer! My makeup! Are you out of your minds or what? Quiet, I heard something! - What the hell is going on? - Go back to your seats! It's our families! Answer me! What is going on? What is that? She's fainting! Call for help! She's fainting! Do something, don't leave us like that! Fuck! We're not animals! - There's nothing I can do. - Fuck! We're not animals, help us! She really has to get out, can you please bring her here please? She doesn't want to! Please, be reasonable! She doesn't want to, you hear? Do it, or I'm going to get in trouble! I don't give a shit about your problems! What are you doing for us? You're shitting your pants! What are you afraid of? Fuck, enough, go away! Go suck your boss! Are you ok? Come on, breathe. Like that, good. Anybody here? It's the first time I see that. Usually they always leave someone with us. Now there's no one. I'm going to give you something. You need some sugar. Thank you. - It's good for you. - Yes. That's a good one! She's perverted! - I don't want to put you in trouble. - There's no trouble. It's for my son. It's ok, no big deal. I never thought it would be so hard. See the woman there? She first came here to see her father, 30 years ago. Now she's coming to see her brother, can you imagine? You can't leave fathers and brothers behind. See, she's with the others. You shouldn't have left her with them. She's staying with Fatma, who can't stand me. Do you realize? It's your fault. You're the one who left her. You should have kept her with you. Not at all! Watch me. Nawell, go get me some water. She's thirsty because she talks all day. You're going to marry her son? Yes. Have you met him? Not yet. Hurry "P- May your marriage be happy. Thank you. Go get me some water! Do what she tells you. - Poor girl. - Poor gin? I brought her back to France, I did everything for her! - Why don't you get it yourself? - Mind your own business. - All we hear is you. - You can plug your ears. You don't care about what is going on? We're locked here with nothing to do, even the wardens left. So go take care of your kid and shut up! I can't believe it, you don't give a shit about your men! - They may as well die! - If yours died it would certainly arrange you. Everybody knows you're having fun out there! Shut up bitch! Calm down, have some decency. You can keep your glass. After everything I've done for you... Is it true? Why didn't you tell me? Answer me. Of course you don't want to visit him anymore. You blame it on your daughter. You disgust me, Judith. I don't have a daughter, ok? I made you my daughter. And that's how you thank me. Did you forget where you come from? - Where did I picked you up? - I wasn't in jail. Be careful what you say! I was better at home! I made you come to France. I don't want your France. Stop, you're gonna regret it. One doesn't get far with your delinquent son! You can keep your son! I prefer picking a French girl rather than you. That's it, over. The French girl will not want your delinquent son! I have no time to waste. Neither does my son, not with you! Look at me, here. Aren't you ashamed? I'm ashamed for you. I hope to never see you again. Enough! I can't take it anymore. Now I'm over your vicious tongue! What did she do to you? So that you treat her like that? You are having fun, as if It's normal. We don't even know what is happening out there! You're the elder, you should be giving the example. But you prefer fights and insults. Aren't you ashamed? At your age? Is it not your son who's in prison? You own flesh? You're totally insane! Yes I am, but one thing is sure: your son led mine to shit. - You think I'm afraid of you? - Mom, stop. My son was a good boy before he met yours. No wonder, with a mother like you. Even a girl from our home doesn't want him. You're insane! Leave me alone! There's nothing you're ashamed of! But I'm not mad at your son. With a mother like you it's normal for him to be where he is. You can offer him dozens of weddings with the money he's gathered! Shut your mouth! Who do you think you are? You think you're better than us? You didn't know how to raise your son! He's not a saint! Liar! You'd do anything to tarnish his reputation. You haven't even managed to raise him. You screwed up! She's pregnant! Go get the kid. No, leave her! I'm the one who started, not her. Really? Let her go. Take her out! - And evacuate the mother too. - No, you can't do that! Calm down or I cancel your visit permits, get it? New! I did what I could. I slaved to pay for his studies. So that he doesn't hang out with young people from the ghetto. I didn't give up, spent sleepless nights. I've been harsh. I did as I was taught and raised. Your father was never there to help me. That's the way it is. That's the way he is. Yet he was good at school. You used to tell me I wasn't severe enough with him. That's not true. I was harsher with him than I am with you. Remember, he used to help everyone in the ghetto. He carried Mrs Kandi's groceries. He played ball with the kids. He was a good boy. He would hold me in his arms saying he loved me. I don't know how we ended up here. I don't know. I don't understand. I don't understand. Traduction: Valentin Lewandowski RepÃ©rage: ThÃ©ophile Gay-Mazas
