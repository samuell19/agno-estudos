Poverty, deprivation, and hunger... ...that is his environment, which he thinks, demands power to exist. Now, what is that power? Money? He doesn't have any. Respect? Nobody will give him that. Then what will he do? Just peep into his life; His childhood. No parents. He has had to look to others for affection. Look at the atmosphere he's in. Even you must agree that... ...it's the atmosphere that makes or breaks a man. If he's not good... ...he's neither bad! - This court has already given him 3 chances. 3, or 4? - Four, sir. It's not a question of how many times. The question is... ...whether we have faith in him, or not. I have faith in him. I know this court has let him off, and, whenever he comes back again... ...I feel sad, but yet, I don't want to lose my faith in him. Because, I know there is something deep down in him. In him... - He knows what self-respect means to a man. - Okay. I don't think the one you're arguing for is even listening! I appreciate your faith in him, but if I see this hero here again... ...l'll send him to jail! Rs. 250 fine. Next case. I had told you not to wear that thing round your waist to court. Anyway, heard what the judge said? You're to report to me every week. So okay. Don't worry. These judges just sit and order! - Rs. 250! What for? - You'll hit a policeman, and won't you be fined? Madam you... I told you. I was sitting quietly. That constable hit me for nothing. Then I also retaliated. Honestly. How much do I owe you in fees? You know I don't take any fees from you. - Yes I know. - But you'll feel bad if I refuse every time? Right? Then do one thing. Pay me the 250l- I paid for you as bail... ...and 150l- as my fee. Total Rs. 400. I'm taking this money, so that your self-respect doesn't get hurt. If you really want to... you can be a gentleman. I'll do that. - What's this "self-respect"? - Your head! "Self-respect" means being cheated for 400l-! Come... Siddhu is a good person. It is his conditions that have made him do bad things. He has to look to others for love and affection. How much? - Pity you had to pay her 400l-! - How was I to know she'll take it? But, your Madam is real lovely. Does she just take fees, or does she take something else too? What? What did you say about her? I don't want any cheap remarks about that lady. Get me? Tell me one thing. Why doesn't your brother stay with you? Why are you bothered? Why doesn't your father live with your mother? - Feel like having beer. - Yes, let's freak out. - Sure. - And the money? - Mumbai has many "mobile banks!" - We'll "withdraw" from one! - Let's go... Your brother's calling you. - 7,800l- - And 8,300l- - Off with you. Come on you... - What about Nilesh? - 8,500l-. - This is wrong. Check again. - He hits beautifully. - Hits? He blasts them! Last match he had torn the rivals to shreds! - Whom are they playing next? - Matunga. - Put 50,000l- on them. And send a note to this batsman that this time... - Four or five? - Four. - That he's to be out at four! - And send him 10 grand! - That boy will not agree. - He's a man of principles. - Just write to him, will you? That Siddhu's here. Shall I take him in? You idiot! He's one of us. Of course let him in. Come in. Oh Tyson! Come on in. How are you, eh? Let's have a bout today. Come on, hit me. Solid left, eh? I didn't get a punch like that even as a champ! - He's just a kid. - Sure. But of some use. - Did you call me? - Yes, come here. - You come with me. Now sit down here. Is the letter ready? Give it to me. You've got to do a job for me. There's a cricketer in the Mumbai Gym. His name is Salgaonkar. Give this to him and tell him he's to do what this letter says. First be nice to him. If he doesn't agree, rough him up. But not as hard as you punched me, okay? - Take this. - What's in it? - How are you concerned? - I've to give it to him, you see. - So what? - I must know what it says. - It contains... ...an invitation to your brother's wedding to Salgaonkar's mother! Do you want to do this for me? - Sure. - Then do it. Why these questions like a lawyer? There's something fishy in Nandu's accounts. No! I didn't take anything. No, I didn't take it all. I tally it to 42,000l-, he has credited just 33,000l-. I've done nothing. Forgive me, please. You bastard! You pocket my money? How dare you! How dare you do it! You lie to the very person that pays you? Had he asked me for it, would I have refused? Have I refused you anything? I give whatever you ask for. I look after you like my own kids. Even then he cheated me! Throw the vermin out! If I see you around here again, I'll break your knees! Better check it. Damn good! Jai, you've brains. Keep the amount. I'll get you a few more if you like. Simply wonderful! Siddhu... Your brother is a genius. His brains and my heart will conquer Mumbai one day! Give him a good job. He just boxes the whole day. Boxing is good. It's my line too. It'll come in handy someday. Now keep this, and get going. Here. Keep this. - May I have my bike? - Take this. Now go. - See you tomorrow. - Sure. See you. - Who is it? - Over here. - Here. - What is it? - A love letter. - Who has sent it? - It's all inside. Read it. What nonsense is this! I don't do all this. Now get out. It's a Chinese balm on bruises and pains. You gonna need it! - Yes, or No? - No! What do you say now? Good! Here, you can have this Chinese balm free. His face is all blackened... Shall I wipe it for you? What a gait! See what he did to me. - Is it a man to man or a free for all? - I'm enough for you. What's happening here? Can't you hear? Get back! If you fight I'll arrest you both. Now get going... okay? - The account's incomplete. - Shall I complete it for you? - Will you run 10:10? - Never mind, Charlie. He doesn't have the guts! Hey Charlie Chaplin... Where do I come? Tonight at 9:30 p.m. At Sanpada station. They made a fool out of you and vanished. And who the hell are these non-entity mobike riders? So! You've come, eh? Ready for the 10:10 Run. I'm ready even for a 100:100! See, hear and understand. Then talk, okay? Right over there... Just after that turning... ...is the Sanpada station. At exactly 10 past 10... ...a fast train will start from there, heading this way... ...right on this track here! When the train comes at that turning, that girl... ...will drop a hanky, and, you've to run towards the train! On this very track. And this is a flag. Stick it where you get off the track. And right over there... Can you see that pole? That red cloth hanging on it, marks Charlie's record. If you jump off the track before the pole, you lose. Then whenever you meet Charlie you'll bow and salute him. And suppose I pass your Charlie's pole, then? It has never happened before, and if it does... ...then Charlie will run! And when Charlie runs... ...even the fastest train salutes him! This guy's out to kill you! Yes. Don't take on a train. It concerns your life. Let's go. Yes, Siddhu, we'll retreat. No need to show them such daring! - What the hell are you doing? Are you mad? - Leave it, friend. Not badly hurt are you? What's going on there? Who the hell is it? Police! It's the police! Run! Get on! Hurry! Come on, sit. So that's how it is! Now that you have a girl, you forgot us, eh? Here, take this. Pull it off. - What are you doing? - The watchman wasn't allowing me in, so I climbed! I told him we knew each other. - Told him I'd climb near the window. - Wait a minute, I'll get a rope. Don't move. You'll fall down. Don't scream! I may fall. No! Stop! You'll fall, damn it! I'm coming. Give me a hand. - No! No! - Give me your hand. Else I'll fall. Don't let go, or, I'll fall. Oh God! That was close! But what are you doing here? - I came to get my jacket. - What? You came on the 22nd floor up a pipe, just for your jacket? You're crazy! Absolutely mad! What's your name? - And yours? - I'm Siddhu. - Where are you going? - Just looking around. - Will you have a drink? - Get something cold. - Yes, Ma'am? - Come here please. Oops! - Get 2 cokes, please. - Chilled, okay? Your house is grand. Spent money, eh? Are you sort of... With that Charlie? - What? - That Charlie... - Are you involved with him? - Why? - Just like that. - That day he was putting on quite a show. - No... There's no involvement at all. Bloody fool! How long does it take for you to open the door? - What's going on here? - I'm sorry, sir! - Sorry indeed. Get me a drink, and, one for Madam too. - Who's that for? - Miss Alisha. - She's at home? - Yes, sir. Come and meet my friend. My daughter, Alisha. How rude! Can't you say hello properly? She's a kid. - Who's he? - He's my friend. Then what's he doing in your bedroom? - He has come to meet me. - Then why is he in your bedroom? - Why not in the drawing room? - You see, I climbed... - Who asked you to interrupt? - Don't talk like that. - He's my friend. - He looks like a jail-bird. You keep quiet. Don't interfere... You talk so rudely to my guests? Get lost! You're manner less! Bloody rude girl! Go! Go! Even your mother left me! Your brother ran away too! Want some chewing gum? No? - Same farce daily! - Does your dad get drunk regularly? Then, he's either very affectionate... ...or he picks fights on petty matters. I'm fed up! Do you know, when I stood on the road and saw these sky scrapers... ...with big windows, velvet drapes and beautiful lamps... I thought the rich must be really very happy. Happiness has nothing to do with being rich or poor. One must have love, parents... ...siblings and friends to be happy in life. - Come, let's go somewhere. - Okay. - What's this? - Will you give our money? - My brother's out. - He hasn't told me to pay any money. - He hasn't, eh? Why are you hitting him? - Couldn't you see them hitting him? - Can't you see I'm eating? - Anna! Save me. - Why call me? Run! Catch him! Won't pay our money. Bastard! Let him go! You and your extortion! - Do something. - Sure. Enough now. Get lost you... You swine! Create a ruckus, eh? What the hell! You hit an innocent? Hit these goons instead. - Quiet. - Come along... - I'll complain against you. - Do that. Tell your brother to give us our 'protection money'. Else... no hotel! - See you in the evening, Siddhu. - Come. Easy now... - Sit here. Not badly hurt, are you? - Forget that. Get his head examined. - Why did you pick a fight with that lot? Stupid! - Why? If someone raises his voice against tyranny is that stupidity? They hound you 24 hours. Have turned this area into hell, and... ...if anyone fights for his right, you call it stupidity? - O'brother... Stop lecturing! This is all theory. - That blood there, is a reality. - So is the blood that they suck! - Here. - Blood will flow if we fight. Else, they'll suck it! If we fight, at least our self-respect will be intact. And when all your bones get broken what will you do with self-respect? Bones can be rejoined at least. But one's self-respect, Never! That bloody self-respect again! Which world are you from, friend? I'm from this world. My name's Hari. I'm Siddhu. Siddhartha Marathe. Hey! What are you all doing? Leave it alone! - Torture a poor animal. - What's up? - They're beating a pup. I can't stand anybody harassing a poor animal. Really? I too can't stand anyone bullying a human! Listen, son, to keep silent after a certain limit, is cowardice. Siddhu... this... what happened, son? He called you "Master Specs". So? Your father is a master, and he does wear specs! - If he teases you, I'll bash him! - But that boy's much younger to you. If you must fight, fight against injustice. - You also fought, didn't you? - Yes, but we fought the British. They were tyrants! They tortured the helpless Indians. But we didn't fight them physically. We showed non-co-operation... ...took out protest-marches. - What happened in that really? Naughty! How many times will you hear this story? - Please. For the last time. - We were marching in protest... - I, Majid, Jayanti... - Alka, and those others. Then the police came and started caning the crowd. We ran! We ran and hid in a hostel. They chased us there. They searched the whole hostel. The others escaped, but I was caught. - Then? - Then the police thrashed me! They kept at it for 2 whole days. They said... ...if I didn't betray my friends, I'd be jailed for life! - Did you betray? - No way! - I too will fight the Brits. The British have gone, son. But yes! Bullies are still there. And they'll always be. Instead of fighting these rogues... ...the world bows to them! But you go ahead and fight them. Because... anybody can swim along with the waves... But he is a real man... ...who cuts through the waves, and surges ahead! Well done! My brave boys! Just a minute... Who were they? - The Hotel owner's brother. - And a social worker. - What did you do with him? - We hit him. - You did, eh? Good. - Not the way you think. - We struck him, but not killed him. - Then go and kill him. - After today's thrashing, he won't do anything. - Sure. And it's a question of just 1500l- after all. This is what you don't understand. That's why, you are you... ...and I am Ronnie. It's not the money. It's that they dared to oppose me publicly. Today it was the hotel owner, tomorrow it'll be a vendor... ...and a cobbler, the day after. In time, I'll mean nothing to them. I'll see to them personally. - I'll kill them. You just see. - Hold on a minute. After months of toil, we can get the contract to build the colony. I've spoken to the minister, and he's ready to give us the money. Come here. If we get this contract, all your black money... ...will become white. If you go out now, make noise... ...won't your name get spoilt? If any report goes against you... ...that minister will not even speak to us, let alone meet us! - All your hopes of becoming a great builder will shatter. - No they won't. Look! I want this contract. - No matter what I do! - I'm there for you. - And spare this hotel owner? - You leave him to me. Okay. You see to it. But listen... I'm smelling something burning in this whole affair. And this fire has to be put out today, just now! - Munna! - Hallo, brother. - How are you? What are you doing? - Making tea, eh? Allow me. - I'll do it. Let me do it. Get aside. Where's the milk? - I'll get it. - How's your boxing shaping up? I practice for 3 hours now. Got a match coming next week. - This time I'll really bash them! - Listen. I've a job for you. There's a social worker in our area. I think his name is Hari. Hari? I know him. I had met him only the other day. Know something? I met him, and I remembered our Dad. He talks just like Dad. We must fight injustice... ...help each other, and... what do you call it... ...respect everyone. A good man. When will you face the truth? - Tell me. When? - What truth? About Dad. Have you forgotten Shyamsunder? The one who had come from Pune? What did he tell Dad? - What? What had he said? - Nothing. He told him nothing. What nonsense are you talking? I know nothing! Okay. Forget it. Look! Some people here are scheming against Ronnie. There's a meeting in the school. Go and check it out. - I don't want to tell tales. - That's just against friends. You're doing this for me. Understand? Go, okay? I'll see you later. Keep this money. Is that all? So few people? Are there just so few who want to fight? - Master... ...you called us to talk. We're not here to fight. - But that's just what we're here for. - I did drink a bit. But not so much as to make my wife a widow! - I've small kids, you see. - If you run away from this war... ...then how will you answer their questions? - What questions? Did I question my father for them to question me? But there is a question. Just one question. How to stop Ronnie's goons from taking your hard earned money? And there's just one answer to this. Yes! With me. See this. See this court-order that Fatima Madam has made. It's a complaint of what atrocities Ronnie carries out. Just sign on this, and see what you get in return. Death! Whoever signs that, will die most certainly. And are you living now? You're just mobile corpses! How long will you sacrifice yourselves for that devil? Tell me. - Why sit there? Come here. - No thanks. I'm fine here. - But why has he come here? - Why? He lives in our area too. - But his brother Jai is... - Ronnie's biggest crony! - Hey! - If you say anything against Jai, I'll sock you! - Hold on. So what do you say? Just a signature. This paper is so powerful that it can burn Ronnie's realm to ashes! Isn't there one amongst you, who'll support the truth? Answer me. - Very good. - Are you mad? - Sit down. Sit down, I say! - Sign here, please. - Don't listen to him. - Sit down! - Sign here. - Someone will have to stand someday. - How can a poor do that? - He has to walk with his head bowed. - Not a poor, but a coward. A coward bows to injustice. A poor is not weak. They're trying to scare you. Stop! Where are you going? - Stop! Wait! - Not that way. This way. Look, I can't talk like you. But, what you're doing is very dangerous. Whatever, this is the only way out for me. Not a way out, but a "No Entry!" Ronnie won't kiss you for it you know. Nor will he shut shop for you. This is how it is here. That's because we allow it to be so. He hits us and we keep quiet. He threatens and we get scared. Our weakness becomes his strength. Whose betterment are you seeking? These people in this neighborhood? If Ronnie hounds you, nobody will come to save you. They'll hide in their holes like mice! Who says I'm fighting for anybody? I'm fighting injustice because that's the only way I know to live. You? Me? I don't go near such things. "Live and let live", is my motto. - I don't pick fights with anybody. - I too am pretty straight. I just shouldn't feel ashamed when I see myself in the mirror. That's the trouble with you. Your words make me dizzy. I'm warning you again. Stay away from all this crap. I've to go now. Bye. Let's go there... Come on. - This one's open. Hurry. - What if the car's owner comes? There's place for him in the dicky. Now when I call you, you've to give a statement in the court. Don't be scared. Madam has arranged security for you too. - From tomorrow 2 constables will be with you. - And with you also! - Me? - It's essential. You know whom we're dealing with. Come here, will you? Why didn't you come to me after that meeting yesterday? Nothing happened there for me to report to you. - Then what's this? - What is it? - They sent this statement to the court. That Ronnie bleeds them white. They're fed up of him. Read it. - That hotelier's brother signed it. - He's just a kid. What can he do? And what will Ronnie do? Attend his business, or the court? - Forget it. For now the matter is straightened out. - My foot! Nothing of the sort. That preacher is stuck in my throat you see! You mean Hari? He's a nice guy. What can he do? - Nobody even listens to him. - Everybody is a nice guy to you. Okay, he's nice. Bring him to me. I want to see him. You're friends, aren't you? Call him and convince him. True. I also told him many times, what he's doing is wrong. - But he doesn't listen. If you tell him, he may. - Just bring him! - Who is it? Yes? - I want to talk to you. - Now? - Yes. It's important. Meet me on the bridge. - Okay. They're hitting him! You said you wished to talk. You swine! Why did you kill him? I won't spare you! Why did you kill him, eh? Raunak Singh! You bastard! I'll kill your brother, damn him! He has gone mad! He talks back to me! Going home, are you? I'll come along too. Hope there's food at home. Its been ages since we ate together. You're crying because I slapped you. Silly! I didn't slap you. It was... Does anybody talk to Ronnie like that? Are you mad? You abused Ronnie! Ronnie! All this is his business. Why do you interfere in it? Go now, I'll see you tomorrow. Here, keep this. - What happened? - Alisha's brother died in an accident. - Alisha's brother? - Yes, sir. Siddhu! My brother... Come in. Will you have some tea? What's the matter? What have you done? - I want to tell you something. - Yes, go on. That day, I... That day I was on the bridge... ...when Hari was murdered. - I only asked him to come out. - So it was you? - But... I didn't know they'd kill him. I thought they'd just sound him. I betrayed Hari. I'm responsible for his death. Who were those people? - I said, who were they? - I told you I was responsible. But you didn't kill Hari, did you? Then who killed him? You better come in. I'll present your statement in the court, where you'll tell everything. Who those people were; what exactly happened, and who killed Hari. - I'll just tell about myself. - But you... - I've betrayed Hari. - Now no more betrayals. - What? You won't betray the very guys... ...who've killed an innocent with so much cunning? Didn't you just admit that you're responsible for Hari's death? Do you want to live with that guilt on your mind forever? So I came here, didn't I? Yes, I've committed a crime... ...and I must be punished for it. So, I'll admit that... ...I pushed Hari over the bridge. Let them hang me. - Hero, eh? You'll go to the gallows for Hari, but won't give him justice! Who are these people you're saving? What are they to you? One of them is my brother. Sit down, will you? Look, no relation is above justice. And we're not talking of just giving justice to Hari. We're talking of justice to all those who live in Ronnie's terror. The truth that will come out of your mouth... ...can end that terror forever. The biggest truth for me is, that Jai is my brother. I know how important Jai is in your life. A brother on whose shoulders you sat and saw the world. Whom you depended upon by holding his finger. But in all this you're forgetting what Jai really is. - Jai is a criminal... - I know! I know what Jai is. - Whatever he is, he's my brother. - Great! Wonderful! You were a lay-about till yesterday and now you talk like this? You'll give justice to your pal. Sacrifice yourself for Jai. These cheap principles cannot hide the truth. Jai is a criminal. And he'll remain one, even if you keep silent! Truth makes your blood boil, eh? It hurts. If you have the guts, go and find out... ...how much it'll torment Alisha to know this repulsive truth! - Today's your boxing match, right? - Yes. - Then you better go. - Sure. I want to tell you something. About Hari. The bout you're awaiting so impatiently will soon begin. Some vouch for one. Others vouch for the other. And today, both the boxers are right before you. Siddharth Marathe, a boy from Dongri. To fight the champion one must have a courageous heart. Let's see how courageous is this lad's heart. And his opponent is "Black Tiger". What a fantastic round! And it belonged to Siddharth. I'll kill him! Lose! Do as I tell you. Ronnie has put his money on the Champ. - Money? - Just lose the fight. Get knocked out. I'm telling you. Are you listening to me? He'll kill you! What are you doing? Didn't you hear me? He'll kill you! Don't you understand? Stop it! He'll die, damn you! Angry, eh? You don't understand. What could I do? This is Ronnie's business. What could I say to him? That, "He's my brother. Let him win?" Do you know how much he earned tonight? - And what did I get? - Why? Didn't you get your money? He said he gave you 5,000l-. Rs. 5,000l- is a lot. Anyway, forget the money. From today you're his 'special' guy. Just like me. Else he doesn't talk properly to guys of your age. - It took 10 years for others... - To become Ronnie's 'cutlery'! You call me his "cutlery"? Who do you think you are? Who are you? A champion? Do you think you're a Champ? A few bouts don't make a Champ. Do you know who's a real champ in life? It's Ronnie! Not us. We're the losers. Good we met Ronnie... ...else, we'd be rotting in some gutter by now. You too, brother? You are educated. You've got brains. Brains? They're sold for Rs. 32 per Kg. At the butcher's. What will you do with brains? One needs money! And to get that one has to fight the world. Look at Ronnie. From rags to riches! He meets many important people. But have you seen his demeanor? Puts everyone in their proper place. And who the hell are you? Uneducated, lay-about! A drink here... a little fun there. And dreams of a rich girl! What are you, me and all of us? Nothing! "Anybody can swim along with the waves... But!" "He is a real man, who cuts through the waves and surges ahead." So! This spark was ignited here. Isn't that fire put out yet? The one who talked so loftily. Who had high ideals. That man who betrayed his 2 friends! The truth won't change if I keep silent, brother. If you have the guts face the truth. Know the man within you. Our father was a coward. A weakling in mind. A traitor! You have his blood in you! If you can, know him! Discard him from within you. Come here, son. Come here, look son. He has come to meet your father. - Just show him your house. - Where are you from? - Pune. - You knew my father there? - Yes. - Your name? You are Shyamsunder Agrawal. I know you. You all had fought with my father against the British, right? Father! Look who's here. So, you're hiding here, are you? And I've been seeking you for the past 20 years! What's this? Celebrating "Independence?" Since when? When? Doesn't this flag remind you of something? Or have you forgotten it all? Can't you see blood on this? George, Abbas... Dixit, and that poor Alka. You betrayed us so very easily. You couldn't endure 2 slaps? You told them our addresses? Due to your cowardice, only to your cowardice... 5! 5 freedom-fighters were killed. This life you're leading by letting your friends down. I spit on it! Traitor! Coward! Father! What happened? Go and get some sugar. Go! Father was a good man, but, he was weak-minded like us. He couldn't fight the bad, thus, he wanted his sons to be daring. He taught me to fight injustice. To fight for the truth. I'll also walk the path that father paved for me. I'll be the man which father wanted to mould me into. See this. Your Ronnie! First, he bullied the poor. Now, he'll bleed them white, legally. No, he won't do that. Really? Who'll stop him? I will! I'll go against Ronnie in the court. - I'll tell everything about him. - And what about Jai? Him too! You'll have to tell everything about Hari's death too. I'll tell them. I'll tell them everything. Even if it means life-term for my brother. Let anything happen. Hari was my friend. Everyone must know the truth about his death. I'll finish the work Hari started. Is it the same Siddharth who boozed and made noise in general? Remember what I had said to the judge in the court? I believe Siddharth. One more thing. That day in court, I... ...I had stolen... - Four hundred rupees! - You knew it? - Yes. I knew it. And I also knew that one day you'll come and tell me about it! In your eyes I can see that you've found yourself. Don't know about that, but, I've lost the one I loved the most. Wait! Even if he wants to tell the truth, will I get my brother back? He didn't do it purposely. His own brother had told him... ...that they just wanted to chat. He didn't know they meant to kill. And now if he's going to the court it's not for his conscience... But for Hari... and you too. What would you have done in his shoes? You still love him. Am I not telling the truth? - That lawyer's here for you. - Who? That female? - Yes. - Let her come in. - What is it? - Are you him? - Don't you know? - What's this? - It's a summons for you. Tomorrow morning at 11 A.M. You have a case in the court. What did you say? A case against me in the court? - Hold on. What's he accused of? - Oh, many things. But 2 offences in particular. Extortion and Murder! Yes. Murder of Harihar. What are you saying? I killed that man? Who wants to invite death by accusing me of this? The Government. The Govt. Has accused you. - And this time we have an eye-witness too. - Who? Tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock! - What's going on? - I'll take care of it. Don't fret. Who's worried? Who's this eye-witness? - Who the hell are you? - Get lost! We've come to your office, and, you keep sitting? Lift him up! - What are you doing? - I broke his arm. - You want yours broken too? - Look, just walk away quietly. - Else Ronnie won't spare you. - You better go quietly yourself. Else, I won't spare you! Gotya, get going from here. I don't want to fight you. You and I have an age old fend. Today I'll settle that score with you! Tell Ronnie this is for starters. I'll finish it tomorrow in court. And he said he'd kill you, and go to the court too! I see. It's your brother who's going to stand as a witness! - No. He can't do this. - Then is he lying? There's some mistake. He'll never go against us. - No mistake! Did you see that night how he had pounced on me? What are you looking at? Go after him! No! Wait! You'll not send them after him. He's my own brother. - Then you tell me, what should be done? - Don't worry. I'll talk to him and he'll listen. Someone has instigated him. Okay. You talk to him. But remember, if your brother stands as a witness tomorrow... ...l'll lose my contract. And if I lose that, you'll lose your brother! It's been uphill for me, all the way up here. If anybody comes in my way, he's a goner! Anybody! Listen, will you? All will be fine. Don't be scared. Shall I come with you? - I'll come with you. - Come on. - What's going on? - What you are seeing. You'll stop Ronnie? Didn't you see what happened to others? - We'll see. - What? What will you see? There's nothing to see in this game. Whoever fights Ronnie... he's dead! - I'll fight him! - You? You'll fight him? Are you mad? I don't get you. That night, you asked me to see within myself. - And now that I have, I'm mad! - I haven't come here to argue. Here, take this. And sign on it. It says you're withdrawing your case against Ronnie. Listen to me. Leave this area tomorrow. We'll give you a house too. Want money? I'll send you monthly. - Live happily. What else do you want? - Nothing. I don't want any of this. I'll now do, only what is right. I know Ronnie deals in black money, right? Lt'll all changed. He doesn't want all this. I've great plans for him. You'll see. I'll fix everything in 2 days flat! This is the difference! It's your job... ...to cover his evil deeds, and mine is, to expose them! Will you sign this, or not? This was all that was left between us! Will you kill me with the very hand that had once fed me? Then why do you do all this? Practice your boxing and keep out. After that night, you are asking me to do boxing? There you go again. Ronnie had put money on that match! To hell with him. Why didn't you stop him? Why didn't you say he's my brother. I won't ask him to lose. Forget the match. All your life you've walked an evil path. And when I came after you, why didn't you show me the right path? You were my brother. My elder brother. Why didn't you think of me? It's not too late even now. Leave all this. Come with me. You too can be a witness against Ronnie. We'll fight together. Okay? No. I'm much too deep into it. Keep this. It'll be better if you don't have to use it. I want to get away. Don't be scared. I've just the place for you. Come along. Your brother's calling you. What is it? Who's that man? Help me! I need the police. Stop! Not on the face! On his body. Help me! They'll kill him. Pour alcohol in his stomach! Force him to drink it! Stop! Please, stop! Now our scores are even. But next time we meet... ...I won't spare you! I'll kill them. I won't spare them. I'll kill you, Ronnie! - You stay here with him. - No! Don't go there. - They'll kill you! - Listen! Don't leave him alone. - I'll just come. - Wait! Don't go there! Wait! Wait! They'll kill you! Listen to me! If you go there, he will kill you and say it was in self-defense. And he'll go free! You want to avenge Jai's death, right? And avenge Hari's death too? Then take revenge in the court! That's the only way to finish Ronnie! You've to complete Hari's work. Don't let his death go waste. Don't let Jai's death go waste. You have to do it. This court wants to know about the night of 17th Dec. The night Harihar Mafatlal was murdered. That night Raunak came to me with my brother, Jai. He said he wanted to talk to Hari. Explain something to him. So I agreed to bring him. After an hour, one of his men came to my room. Bansi. He said Raunak wants to meet Hari on the bridge. So at night... ...I went to Hari. Before I could intervene, Raunak threw him over the bridge. I rushed down to see... - Hari was run over by a train. - Liar! You're lying, I say! Where will you go? Come back in your area. I'll hold a court for you there. Bastard! You're giving a false testimony against me! You're a goner, Siddharth. You're dead now! Did you hear that? He is as good as gone! If this client of yours says one more word... ...l'll cancel his bail, and handcuff him! The court will adjourn till 11 A.M. On Monday. Shut off that engine! You look into my eyes? Who'll save you? That damn court? That court will save this area? This area has but one owner. Me! Raunak Singh! Close all the shops, and this whole area too! Why are you hiding in there? Come out, damn you! Come out! Do you think I'll leave this area? A rat like you can't make me run! This is my area. Do you hear? This is my home! And nobody can oust me from my home! Come on out! Go on... come out. Just you wait, kid. I'll give you such a hiding... ...that you won't recognize yourself. - You've broken my law here! - What law? The law you've made to loot these people? Behind which you hide, and do black marketing? That law? What I did is correct, and I'll do it again too. - Really? - I will... - What will you do? Kill me? Like you threw Hari under the train? And Jai... He was one of your men... Raunak! I'm not scared of you. Know why? Because you're just a goon! A coward! Had you been brave, you'd be on your own. You wouldn't carry this "cutlery"! Yellow-liveried, that's you! And today, I'll expose you for what you really are! I'll bare you to the bone! You've got the shops shut, eh? I'll get them opened again. - Try and stop me if you can. - You're biting more than you can chew. I'll thrash you soundly in front of all these people... ...and make you an example. Come on then. Want to see my courage, eh? Then, come on. - Why you... - Nobody will interfere. Nobody will interfere. Let him fight. This is his personal battle. Let him fight! Try to be a champion, eh? Get up! - One... - Start counting. - Two... - Three... - Get up, boxer! - Four. - Trying to be a boxer, eh? - Yes, go on... He was talking a lot today. Now he has forgotten how to talk! - Put your bets - 1:10, he won't get up! - You've lost. - He's up again... He's fuming boys... Come on, damn you! One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten... Quiet! - Beat him up! - Beat them up! Anybody can swim along with the waves... But he is a real man... ...who cuts through the
