(SNEEZES) (ENGINE REVS AND SPLUTTERS) TOO-LOUD BEAR: YEEEEEEEE-HAW! (HONKING IN THE DISTANCE) FUNSHINE BEAR: WHOA! LOVE-A-LOT BEAR: EW! I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THE CARE-O-METER IS DOING RIGHT NOW. WELL, I SUPPOSE IT COULD BE WORSE. (THUNDER) (CLEARS THROAT) YOU MEAN LIKE THAT? CARE BEARS: (GASP) TENDERHEART BEAR: OH, I THINK OUR NEW NEIGHBOURS ARE SO BUSY THINKING ABOUT WISHING, THEY HAVEN'T NOTICED WHAT'S HAPPENING TO CARE-A-LOT. WISH BEAR: (SIGHS) THIS IS ALL MY FAULT. FRIEND BEAR: OH WISH BEAR, DON'T BLAME YOURSELF. BUT... (SIGHS) I WISHED FOR SOME NEIGHBOURS TO MOVE INTO CARE-A-LOT WHO LOVED WISHING AS MUCH AS I DO. ON SECOND THOUGHT, MAYBE YOU SHOULD BLAME YOURSELF. WISH BEAR: I'LL JUST GO TELL THEM THEY NEED TO DO LESS WISHING AND MORE CARING. CHEER BEAR: THAT'S THE SPIRIT! MAYBE I CAN JUST WISH FOR THEM TO WISH LESS AND CARE MORE! ALL: (DISAGREE) WISH BEAR: I GUESS THAT WOULD BE MISSING THE POINT, HUH? ALL: (AGREE) (HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER) WISH BEAR: ...DO LESS WISHING AND MORE CARING. TOO-LOUD BEAR: THAT'S THE FUNNIEST THING I THINK I'VE EVER HEARD! WE LOVE WISHING TOO MUCH?! (CHUCKLES) YEAH, I KNOW, IT SOUNDS SILLY, BUT THERE HAS BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF WISHING GOING ON AROUND HERE, AND IT DOES SEEM LIKE THE MORE I WISH FOR THINGS, THE WORSE THINGS GET IN CARE-A-LOT. TOO-LOUD BEAR: WELL THEN, I KNOW THE PERFECT SOLUTION. YOU'VE GOT TO STOP WISHING... EXACTLY! I KNEW YOU'D- ME BEAR: AND LET US HANDLE THE WISHING FROM NOW ON. UNDERSTAND! TOO-LOUD BEAR: SURE! IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE CONTROLLING "TUTTLES", MAYBE YOU SHOULD LET US HAVE HIM? OOF! TWINKERS: (WHIMPERS) NO, TWINKERS AND I ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER. ME BEAR: BUT I HAD SOME MORE THINGS I WANTED TO WISH FOR. (CHUCKLES) WISH BEAR: BUT... TOO-LOUD BEAR: AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT WISHING UP A MOTORCYCLE - A NICE LOUD ONE! VROOM, VROOM, VROOM, VROOM... VROOM, VROOM, VROOM... AND I HAD SOME THINGS I WANTED, TOO. (SINISTER CHUCKLE) LIKE HOT DOGS AND HAMBURGERS, AND CUPCAKES. OH YUMMY. HEY! (CHUCKLES) WISH BEAR: BUT... (LAUGHTER) (PANTING) TOO-LOUD BEAR: C'MON WISHY, JUST A FEW MORE WISHES. WISH BEAR: I JUST CAN'T. (DISAPPOINTED GRUNTS) LOOK, I WISH IT WAS AS EASY AS SAYING "I WISH YOU ALL HAD TWINKERS SO YOU COULD ALL MAKE ALL THE WISHES YOU WANTED", BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP CARE-A-LOT. TWINKERS: UH-OH. TWINKERS? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? (GASPS) OH NO. OH ME. OH MY. OH BOY! NIFTY! OH! (CHUCKLES) WELL, NOW I'VE SEEN EVERYTHING. TWINKERS! WHEN I SAID "I WISH YOU ALL HAD TWINKERS" I DIDN'T MEAN FOR IT TO HAPPEN! I ACCIDENTALLY WISHED YOU AWAY! (SOBS) TOO-LOUD BEAR: HEY, THAT'S OKAY. HONEST MISTAKE. WE'LL JUST WISH HIM BACK TO YOU. WON'T WE? SURE. ABSOLUTELY! OH, THANK YOU. TOO-LOUD BEAR: AFTER. (GASPS) I MISSED THAT LAST PART. "AFTER" WHAT? AFTER WE MAKE JUST A FEW TEENY-TINY WISHES. MM-HMM. MM-HMM. ME BEAR: WHY DON'T YOU SWING BACK HERE TOMORROW AROUND FOUR-ISH, AND WE'LL WISH HIM BACK TO YOU THEN? C'MON TWINKERS, WE'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO. TWINKERS: (WHIMPERS) BETTER MAKE IT FIVE-ISH. (KNOCKING) (WHIMPERS) UH... WISH BEAR? I CAME TO SEE HOW IT WENT WITH... (GASPS) DON'T LOOK AT ME! I'M HIDEOUS! WISH BEAR! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR TUMMY SYMBOL? (SIGHS) I ACCIDENTALLY WISHED TWINKERS AWAY TO ME BEAR, MESSY BEAR, AND TOO-LOUD BEAR. THEY SAID I COULD HAVE HIM BACK TODAY AROUND FIVE-ISH. (SIGHS) FUNSHINE BEAR: THAT EXPLAINS WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE CARE-O-METER! THE CARE-O-METER HAS MOVED FROM "MOSTLY CARING" TO "NOT CARING ENOUGH". CARE-A-LOT IS GETTING INTO BIG TROUBLE! I KNOW, AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT. I THOUGHT I KNEW HOW TO CONTROL MY WISHING, BUT I DIDN'T. AND WITHOUT TWINKERS, I'M NOT SURE I EVEN KNOW HOW TO CARE ANYMORE. HMMM... INTERESTING. TELL ME ABOUT "CARING". WISH BEAR: I CAN'T. I FEEL ALL EMPTY INSIDE. INTERESTING... TELL ME ABOUT "EMPTY INSIDE". "EMPTY INSIDE" MEANS... I NEED TWINKERS BACK. HE'S MY BEST FRIEND. WELL, I THINK YOU SHOULD GO OVER THERE AND ASK FOR HIM BACK - NOW! DON'T WAIT FOR FIVE-ISH! DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT WOULD WORK? SURE! OUR NEW NEIGHBOURS MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM US, BUT THEY'RE STILL NICE. I'M SURE IF YOU ASK THEY'LL WISH TWINKERS BACK TO YOU RIGHT AWAY. ALL RIGHT! I'M GOING TO DO IT RIGHT NOW! THANK YOU, FUNSHINE. YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU KNOW, WHILE YOU'RE HERE, I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. SORRY, TIME'S UP. WISH BEAR: HEY! (THUNDER RUMBLES) THIS IS GETTING REALLY BAD. OH NO! WHAT HAVE THEY DONE NOW! THIS IS AWFUL. TWINKERS?! TWINKERS! (BIKE HORN BLARES) WISHY! HOW DO YOU LIKE IT? I JUST WISHED THIS BABY UP! ISN'T IT GREAT?! STOP! WHAT WAS THAT?! (REVS THE ENGINE) STOP! IT'S SO LOUD, IT'S BLOWING THE COLOUR RIGHT OUT OF CARE-A-LOT! BLOWING THE COLOUR RIGHT OUT OF CARE-A-LOT? (LAUGHS) I GOTTA TELL YOU, YOU CARE BEARS?! ALWAYS MAKING WITH THE JOKES. WISH BEAR: I'M NOT JOKING. LOOK! YOU SURE THOSE WEREN'T LIKE THAT BEFORE? YES, I'M SURE! (THUNDER) TOO-LOUD BEAR: WHAT'S WITH THE CLOUDS? THE TRAVEL AGENT SAID CARE-A-LOT NEVER GETS RAIN THIS TIME OF YEAR. IT'S ALL THE WISHING WE'VE BEEN DOING. PLEASE, I'VE GOT TO FIND TWINKERS. WHERE IS HE? I THINK HE'S OUT BACK WITH ME BEAR. SHE WANTED TO DO SOME REDECORATING. ♪ ME-ME-ME-ME-ME-ME ME ME-ME-ME ME-ME ♪ WISH BEAR: YOU CALL THIS "REDECORATING?" ME BEAR: GREETINGS VISITORS!

I MANUFACTURE ALL OF MY OWN TRINKETS AND SOUVENIRS. HELPS CONTROL COSTS. (SQUEAKS) ♪ LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA BUT... (GIGGLES) NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?! WHAT? WISH BEAR: A WHOLE AMUSEMENT PARK ALL ABOUT YOU IS NO WAY TO SHOW THAT YOU CARE. ME BEAR: IT SHOWS THAT I CARE ABOUT ME. DOESN'T THAT COUNT? NO. WHERE'S TWINKERS? TWINKERS? I SAW HIM INSIDE THE HOUSE WITH MESSY BEAR. (THUNDER) HEY... WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SKY? (TOO-LOUD BEAR REVS ENGINE) ME BEAR: HEY, WAIT FOR ME! (COUGHS) NOW, I WISH FOR A DOZEN EGGS! (WHIMPERS) OOOPS! (CHUCKLES) I MEANT TO SAY THAT I WISH FOR A DOZEN EGGS ALL CRACKED INTO A BOWL. OH, AND NO SHELLS THIS TIME. (SIGHS) AND NOW, I WISH FOR SOME CHOCOLATE POWDER, MILK, AND SUGAR. AND A MIXER TO REALLY BEAT IT WELL, OKAY? WHOA! OH... MY... MESS! MESSY BEAR: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT! NOW WE NEED A BIG PIE PLATE SO WE CAN... WISH BEAR: TWINKERS! (CRYS OUT) OH, TWINKERS! LOOK AT YOU! OH. IS IT FIVE-ISH ALREADY? MESSY BEAR? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I AM MAKING MYSELF A "MUD PIE". "MUD PIE?" IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION. THEY'RE REALLY TASTY. IT'LL BE READY IN A MINUTE. UH, PULL UP A CHAIR. OH, UH, WELL... IF YOU CAN FIND ONE. UH, OH NEVER MIND, I'LL JUST WISH YOU UP ONE. WISH BEAR: THAT'S IT! NO MORE WISHING! DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT THE MESS YOU'RE MAKING? OF COURSE NOT. I'LL JUST GET TWINKERS TO CLEAN UP THE KITCHEN AFTER I'M DONE. IT'S NOT JUST THE KITCHEN, IT'S ALL OF CARE-A-LOT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? HARMONY BEAR: OH, WISH BEAR! I'M SO HAPPY WE FOUND YOU I COULD SING! HAVE YOU SEEN WHAT'S HAPPENING? BEDTIME BEAR: ALL OF THE COLOUR IS LEAVING CARE-A-LOT! WHOA. CHEER BEAR: LOOK AT THE RAINBOW.

IT'S JUST YOU'VE BEEN SO BUSY WISHING UP THINGS, YOU'VE FORGOTTEN TO TAKE THE TIME TO CARE ABOUT OTHERS. CHAMP BEAR: THE IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW, IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE CARE-A-LOT BETTER AGAIN. MESSY BEAR: I KNOW HOW - TWINKERS! I WISH THAT ALL OF THIS WAS GONE. WISH BEAR: I DON'T THINK WISHING'S- (GASPS) TWINKERS, NO! WHOA! YOU MADE EVERYTHING TOO GONE. MESSY BEAR?! WISH BEAR: I REALLY THINK IT'S ENOUGH WISHING- MESSY BEAR: TWINKERS? I WISH FOR EVERYTHING TO BE BACK HOW IT WAS, BUT WITH MORE COLOUR. ALL: WOW! OH MY! FUNSHINE BEAR: ACTUALLY, THIS IS A GOOD LOOK FOR US! WISH BEAR: PLEASE, NO MORE... MESSY BEAR: TWINKERS? I WISH FOR LESS COLOUR! FRIEND BEAR: THAT'S BETTER. GRUMPY BEAR: SPEAK FOR YOURSELF... TOO-LOUD BEAR: OOH, VERY RETRO. ME BEAR: MESSY BEAR, I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO WISH BEAR- OH, TWINKERS? I WISH FOR EVERYTHING TO BE LIKE IT USED TO BE! (WHOOSH!) I MEANT HOW IT USED TO BE, BUT NOT THIS LONG AGO. PHEW! WISH BEAR: NO-MORE-WISHING! HE CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE. TENDERHEART BEAR: POOR TWINKERS. (LOUD THUNDER) ME BEAR: POOR US! LOOK! CHAMP BEAR: PLEASE WISH TWINKERS BACK TO WISH BEAR SO SHE CAN HELP CARE-A-LOT! UH, UM... GOOD IDEA. UH, TWINKERS! I WISH YOU BACK TO WISH BEAR. (GASPS) WHAT'S WRONG? IT'S LIKE HE'S BEEN ALL USED UP.

WELL, BLESS MY STARS! TWINKERS! LOOK HOW BIG YOU'VE GROWN! AND I KNOW YOU. YOU'RE WISH BEAR, TWINKERS BEST FRIEND! I-I THOUGHT I WAS HIS BEST FRIEND, BUT I DIDN'T TAKE GOOD ENOUGH CARE OF HIM. AHHH, TOO MUCH WISHING. YES, AND NOW LOOK AT HIM. HE'S SO WEAK. IS THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN HELP MAKE HIM BETTER? BIG WISH: THAT DEPENDS ON YOU. WISH BEAR: IF YOU MEAN, DID I LEARN MY LESSON? YES. WISHING IS FUN, BUT IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO WORK HARD TO MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE. AND IF YOU CAN DO IT WITH YOUR FRIENDS, THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO SHOW THAT YOU CARE. VERY GOOD. IN THAT CASE... (SQUEALS OF DELIGHT) TA DA! (GIGGLING) TWINKERS! OH! (SIGH OF RELIEF) (CHUCKLES) THANK YOU, BIG WISH! BIG WISH: YOU'RE WELCOME, WISH BEAR.
