(MultiCom Jingle) (railroad whistle blowing) (railroad whistle) - What we got here? Hey kid. Hey, wake up, woo woo. Your turn to shuffle. You ain't ashamed of being a gimp, are you kid? - You think my infirmity gives me a disadvantage? - Kid, what I think, is you're an egg-sucking buttercup. - Come on! Let's get out of here. Now. (both hollering) I swear. That was more fun than I had at the Neosho Spring fair. - Where's that? - It's about a day's ride out of Springfield. You ever been there, Missouri? - No, what's it like? - Well it ain't the worst place on Earth, but you can sure enough see it from there. - [Kid In Suit] Are you a professional fighter? - [Other Kid] Never made any money at it. - You're good. - You ain't so shabby yourself. Where'd you learn all that foot stuff? - Around, here and there. - Where you from? - Chicago. - Simon Wessner. - Nick. - Nick, that's it, just Nick? - Thanks for saving my life. - No worries, I would've done it for anybody. Nick, I hate to see a man outnumbered. I believe in honesty and fair play. Don't you? - Yeah. Yeah I do. - So where you headed for, Nick? - Vancouver. - Vancouver? What for? The gold's all further north, and it's all gone now anyhow. - No, I'm looking for somebody. - Are you a bounty hunter? - No. - Is there a reward? - Maybe, but not in money. - I gotta say Nick, you sure are one mysterious gent. Come on Nick, who are you looking for? - A man. - A man? I guess you really trust me, huh? I mean I only saved your life. - Look, I'm sorry I nearly got us both killed, okay? - That's all right. What's that people say? The guy that laughs last, laughs best. - You got his knife. - Grafton Corners. Well, look out Grafton Corners, Simon Wessner and Nick something, are coming to town. (harmonica playing) Crazy old coot. (water splashing) ♫ Well I come from Alabama ♫ With my banjo on my knee ♫ I'm going to Louisiana my true love-- - That is one strange contraption you got there Nick. What's it made of? - Hickory and leather. - Nick, can I ask you? How's it figure you don't know your true name? Don't it have to be the same as your old man's? - Kind of complicated. - No worries, anyway. I reckon Nick's all you need, if you're not gonna grow up and try to be president. But what I can't figure, is how you got to be Nick in the first place. - [Nick] Sister Emily started calling me that at the orphanage, sort of a joke, because all I had was a nickname for 16 years. - And what was it? - [Nick] What was what? - Your nickname. - Doesn't matter. - Well it matters to me. - Why's that? - 'Cause you can't be partners with a man, unless you know all there is to know about him. - Never been partners with anybody before. - No man wants to be alone, Nick, not out in this part of the world. - Well, I gotta go to Vancouver. - No, you gotta take time to live a little. - I don't know. - See, the main thing partners do for one another, is they stick up for each other. Comes in handy out here. Or maybe you hadn't noticed. So what was it? - What was what? Okay, you promise you won't laugh? - I swear. - Okay. As you might have noticed, I've got a few freckles. - Freckles. That's what they called you, wasn't it? It was Freckles. - Hey, you promised. - I'll never tell. Word of honor. - Yeah. - I swear. Freckles. (horse neighing) Come on, let's take a little look see. (ragtime piano playing) - I need a train schedule. - Come on Nick, stick around. - No you go ahead. (horse neighing) - Help you young fellow? - It says here there's no train for a week. - That's what it says. - But there must be a train coming. - This here's a spur. There is one coming through Moose Junction, the day after next. - How far is that? - Well, it's about 60 miles, due west. - 60 miles, thanks. I'm sorry, Ma'am. Miss. I didn't see you. - It has been a great pleasure meeting you, Simon. - [Young Woman] That's all right. I can manage. - I am pleased, that we will be doing business together. - No worries. (soft music) - Father, look what came for me today. - Well, I'd love to hear you play it sometime. - How about right now? - Excellent idea. Come on. What are you gonna play for me? - Do you know Buffalo Gal? - Buffalo Gal? Of course I know Buffalo Gal. - Where are we going? - Gotta do a guy a favor, make us a couple bucks. - What kind of favor? - Will you relax? Well I'll bet you're just the loudest singer in church. - What if I am? - Oh, is Freckles a cry boy, huh? I'm kidding. - Where are we going? What are we doing? - Nick. I told you. No worries. If it ain't on the up-and-up, Simon Wessner ain't interested. Nick. Girl like that takes a lot more than two-bit odd jobs to make happy. You gotta have cash, you gotta have style. You gotta be a somebody. - Whoa boy, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Whoa now, whoa, easy, easy boy. - Look at this. No disease in this horse boy. No disease in this horse. Get ya to Moose Junction, quick as a wink. Maybe even quicker. - What about that? - What, the bicycle? - You see actually, well the thing is, I don't quite know how to ride a horse. - Oh, city boy are you? Sure come on. It's all yours for five dollars. You give me two dollars short. - Here you go. - Good luck boys. - I can't accept that. - Why not? You earned it. - I didn't do anything. - Well then it's your going away present. No obligations. Unless, maybe you think about stickin' around a bit longer, Nick. - [Nick] I've got a couple of things to figure out yet. - So you stick with me and we'll get there together. - That's not what I mean. - Nick, now I said it before, you sure are a hard one to figure. - Thanks for what you did. Okay? - Yeah well, I guess you owe me one. (acoustic guitar) (birds singing) (Nick shouts) - Stupid, miserable bike. (thunder) (acoustic guitar) - Hyah. Hyah, hyah. Get out of the way, whoa, whoa. What's the matter with you? - I need help, sir. - Well get in. I got an injured man here. Get in, hold his head. - What happened? - Tree fell on him. He's all broke up inside. That's it, good. Keep him steady. Hyah, hyah. Injured man. Whoa. - Who is it? - Tamblin. - Get him inside. Open his shirt. - Thanks for the help. I'm Tom McLean. - Pleased to meet you sir. - You got a name? - Nick. - Hold him down. (thunder) - Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Your kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth, as it is in Heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. - Here we are over here. Give those rims to the wheelwright. I want some saw blades. Heard the bad news, Tom. I feel sorry about it. Good man, Tamblin. What happened? - Up guarding the Limberlost. Big fir come down on him. - By itself. - Stripped and stolen, like the one two weeks ago. - Some folks'd try anything for a buck these days, eh? - I guess so, Jack. - Well, see you later. - Excuse me, Mister McLean? - Help yourself to some chow. - Thank you, sir. But I was wondering if maybe there might be some kind of job for me around here. I've never chopped down a tree before, but I don't mind hard work. - Times are tough here like everywhere else. - Sure, I know that, but I-- - Better eat while there's still something left. - You like chops? - What is it? - The hair. - No thanks. - Where you on your way to? - Vancouver. - Buy a bike, did you? - I tried to make the train at Moose Junction. Wheel broke. Kind of stuck I guess. - There are no jobs here, boy. - I know, I asked Mister McLean. But I'll do anything. - What good can you do with that hand, huh? - Do you think my infirmity gives me a disadvantage? - You tell me. - Shovel me some more spuds on here, will you Hamish? Lots of crippled hands around here, anyway. Show him what you got Fenwick. And you too, Jack. - Spuds? Coffee? Who needs a second, huh? Some right there? Did you make these? - Learned it from my old man. - They're beautiful. - I'm gonna give you a chance Nick. But it's dangerous out there. You saw what happened to Tamblin. - I don't mind danger, sir. - Well I gotta put down a name for the accounts. - How about Smith? Nick Smith. - Half the men up here call themselves Smith. Usually on the run from something. That your situation? - No sir. - The way I see it, a man can't have a better friend than someone who tells him the truth. What about it? Are we gonna be friends? Well, then? - I was six months old. They say a priest found me in a picnic basket. - What happened to your parents? - What about Jones? Nick Jones, that be okay for you? - You think they abandoned you? - Look, Mister McLean, I don't know anything. Some clerk at city hall gave me a name. Told me to start looking in Vancouver. It might not even be him, and even if it is, a lot can happen in 17 years. - What was the name? I'll need to put something down here. - They said his name was O'Brien. Walter O'Brien. - Nicholas O'Brien. - Here you go. Try 'em on. (gentle orchestral music) - So, how do I look? - Like you're from Chicago. Charlie, bring us down a new crosscut. Hey, take that stump on the ridge and tie it back with a twister. (horse neighing) (towman yelling at horses) Soon's we get this cleared, watch it, we'll move on the the Limberlost. One's there with the small saws are buckers, and them there with the two-bit axes are swampers. Now the way I see it, the Limberlost is like a bank. (engine whistle blowing) Values shoot up every day. This country's starting to split apart at the seams. Hey Pete! - Yo! - Give 'em a hand up there with the haul back. Families need homes. A smart man pays attention to what folks want, has the right product and the right time, and Bob's your uncle. - Bob? - What do you say in Chicago? Everything's hunky-dory, fallin' off a log, duck soup? - Thomas McLean? - Hello, Olivia. - Don't Olivia me, you calloused man. Just look what you've done. Now that you've taken away their home, I don't imagine you've given one ounce of thought to where they're going to live, and who's gonna look after them. Have you? No, of course not, not Tom McLean, he's too busy making money to worry about a few piddly little wild creatures. - Olivia, I'm. - Yes? You should be ashamed of yourself. (engine whistle blowing) - I've got more difficult human beings in my life, but none of them quite so, charming. (bird calling) How are you with horses? - Not my favorite animal. - City boy, eh? - Funny you should mention that. - Here we are. The Limberlost. What do you think? - They're big. - My old man bought it 30 years ago, over 7000 acres all together. What you see here is the finest stand of timber on the continent. Spent a lot of time out here when I was younger. - Why is it called Limberlost? - Oh, some dimwit got lost in here, wandered around for weeks. Outsmarted the grizzlies, mountain lions, pert near starved to death before the swamp finally got him. Sucked him down right up to his neck. All the red ants and porcupines took care of the rest. - Guess it's a good idea to stick to the path, huh? - Yeah, if you can find one. (ominous orchestral music) From up here, you'll get a better idea of what it is you're guardin'. The trail's five miles around. Once in the morning, once before dark, in between you'll maintain the fence along the road. You see anything suspicious you fire one shot, no more than that. Don't be a hero. Understood? - Yes sir. (soft orchestral music) - And one more thing. - Yes sir? - Any tom fool can act tough. It takes guts to fess up to your mistakes. You have any problems out here, something you can't get the hang of, you tell me or Dunc about it. - Yes sir, I'll do that. (animal growling) What was that? - Little old cougar. He won't bother you. Do you know how to use that thing? (birds singing) No, you give it a try. - Best stay high and dry if you want to live through the night. I'll tell you something else. Are you listening? - Yes sir. - Nature has strange powers, I can't say what they are, I don't know exactly. But, if you pay attention, you'll get on fine, maybe even improve some. You try to play around with mother nature, and you'll be ground up and spit out like a wad of chewed tobacco. You gotta remember to breathe. (owl hooting) (spooky music) (gun firing) (Nick shouting) (frog croaking) (animal howling) (animal growling) - Should be in a zoo where you belong. (spooky orchestral music) (birds cheeping) (eerie orchestral music) (birds singing) - Does that hurt? - No. - Huh? - Yeah. I don't understand anything about anything out there. It's all so different. Birds, bugs, critters, I want to know what they are, what they do. - These'll get you started. Local woman wrote them both. Miss Olivia Pollard. Took all the pictures, too. - Olivia? She's the one who's crazy about trees and critters? - That's her. Lovely lady. No use for loggers, no use at all. You'd better have this too. Had this since I was a lad. I'm all the way from San Francisco. I used to keep my specimens inside. - What kind of specimens? - For me it was bugs. The more legs, the better. Of course, spiders had their own special appeal. I love the ones that spit. Ever seen a spider spit? - No, actually I haven't. - Wonderful creatures. (engine whistle blowing) - Mister O'Brien. Well there she is. Good as new. Give her a try. - Thanks. - You ready? - Yeah. - Kind of reminds me of you. You used to disappear out there in the Limberlost, you and your old man. Remember that big steelhead you caught? - Learn how to ride that thing. (horse snorting) (spooky orchestral music) - Whoever you are, I know you're in here. You're trespassing on private property, which I'm personally bound to protect with armed force if necessary, by order of Mister Tom McLean, owner of the Limberlost. - Do you intend to shoot me? - I'm sorry. - Nice to meet you again Mister Sorry, I'm Angelica McMurrich. - Hey, are you hurt? - It's just a scratch. I got caught in the stupid swamp. Lost a shoe, I should have known better. - Were you lost? - Lost? Here? I've been coming out here all my life. - Olivia, she's my aunt, asked me to come and feed her babies. If I can find them. - These didn't grow here. - Oh, I did that. Seemed like a good place to grow, so I thought I'd... - You? - [Nick] Put them there. - Think? - Now and then. Nothing at your level I'm sure. - No, I'm sure. What are you staring at? - Nothing. Just the way the light makes kind of a halo. Makes you look like your name. - What do you mean? - Makes you look like, an angel. - Swamp angel's more like it. What's your real name? - Nick. - Nick what? - Nobody. - Nick Nobody. - O'Brien. - I know. - What? - Like to make a wish before we go. Go on. Go on. - Well I guess, one thing is, I sure wish no bears smell me tonight while I'm on duty. (Angelica laughing) - I believe in wishes. Don't you? - Not really. - You'll see. - Do you want to wear my boot? - No, all right I think I can manage. They're under here. Right here. Aren't they just the dearest things? - What are they? - Bear cubs. - I'm from Chicago. - Angelica McMurrich, look at you. What have you done to yourself? - Aunt Olivia, this nice boy saved my life. - Nice Boy? How do you know he's a nice boy? He doesn't look like a nice boy. - I work for Mister McLean, ma'am. - Thought I'd seen you somewhere before. Come along Angelica. You tell that Mister McLean of yours, that this fence he put up, is a spiteful slap in the face of our Creator, who created the Limberlost as a habitat for his most beautiful creations. And anyone who thinks they can come in here and cut it all down, is gonna have to do it over my dead body. - Mister McLean's building homes for families. - Young man, your ignorance is only outdone by your appalling lack of sensitivity. Hyah. - Found a track did you? - Mountain cat, or deer, big deer, bear or something. - Or maybe the most dangerous creature of all. - What's that? Well sir, see it was only Missus Pollard, and her niece, and I didn't fire a shot on account that I thought that, they're pretty harmless. - Well don't be so sure, Oliva packs quite a wallop. She thinks she owns the place. And Angelica, let me see, she'd be about your age, I suppose. - I suppose so, now that you mention it. - Well mend this up, and get yourself into town, and bring us back a couple of hundred more feet of fencing wire. Take the buckboard. - With horses? - Of course with horses, what do you think? (horse neighing) - I know some government people in Vancouver, O'Brien, am I right? Walter, from Chicago. - Yeah, but I. - You don't have to check the records. You go on to the store, I'll send the wire. - Simon. - They need those rims back by Friday, Mister Carter. - Who's your friend? - Whoo! I'll be darned, look who's back in town. - Never left actually, got a job working out at the logging camp. - Oh, honest work huh? Yeah well, me too. You know Mister Carter? - Working for Tom McLean I here? - Yeah, I'm the new guard out at the Limberlost. - Are you then? - So, you get rich yet? - No, can't say I have. - Well, there's still ways to get there if you want, I've got a few angles. - No thanks, a few weeks pay, and I'll be off to Vancouver. - All right Mister Wessner, I don't pay the high wages I do to have you lollygagging around all around the place. - Good to see you again, Nick. - Good seeing you too. - You like the dead things, huh? - Specimens. - Specimens. Maybe you too are the specimen? - I don't understand. - Shadow. Perhaps there are many things you don't understand. - What things? - The men in the camp have been cheated by McLean for a long time, and now they want a share of the profits. - What are you saying? (speaking in foreign language) - If a tree falls in the forest, it's a good idea to get out of the way, yeah? If you don't? But, I believe Grim Tamblin was not so wise as you. Be careful, young man. (ominous orchestral music) (bird calling) - [Duncan] If there's some halfwit donkey out there says Tom McLean's a cheat-- - [Nick] The man's in a position to know. - Listen to me lad, McLean's a hard man to read. Keeps it all bottled up, but his heart's as big as, I've seen him carry plenty of hurt men out of the woods, on his own back. And I know a dozen families he's helped through the winters up here. Nobody every pays him back, and he don't expect it. Old man was the same. Rare breed, both of them. - Well I didn't think he was-- - Don't ever think too much, the brain's the weakest organ in the human body. You want the real answer, you gotta examine your gut. Truth's not an idea. It's something you feel. (cricket cricking) - [Voice In Night] Okay boys, read 'em and weep. (men laughing) (men talking) - I think it's your deal. - I feel my luck changing. - Give me two George. - Somebody lifts my key in church, burglarizes my office, and runs off with Limerlost map. What's happened to this town? - Bad seed all over the place, George, getting worse by the day. - Well I don't like it one bit. - You could always go back east. Become one of those Philadelphia lawyers. Put your cute little girl in one of those stuck up schools. - Angelica has no interest going back east and neither do I. - Will you two stop? What I'm interested in, is finding out who it is that's got in mind to strip my forest clean. - You stole it. You said you believe in honesty and fair play. I trusted you. - What are you talking about? - You know what. The map. How could you just go and break the law? Huh? - Look Nick, I got conned myself, all right? The guy told me it was okay. You saw, he gave me the key. Now I know it was stupid, but I didn't want you to leave. So I figured if I could just get us started. - Well you figured wrong. - I know that, now. I'm sorry, it was a mistake. - Well I don't want anything to do with your kind of mistakes. - Oh, and? Nick? - So you didn't know? - I swear. Plus I saved your life. (light orchestral music) (woman chatting) - Angel? Excuse me, angel? - Oh Nicholas O'Brien, how lovely to see you. - It's good seeing you, too. I believe you forgot something. - Oh yes, thank you. Come and meet the most interesting person. Come all the way from Missouri. - Hi Freckles. - Do you two know each other? - Oh well sure we do. We're partners. Ain't that right, Freckles? - Freckles? Oh that's sweet, is that your nickname? - Oh, no no no no. Nobody calls him that anymore. Out here it's Lefty. Or is it Buttercup? - I answer the same to both. - Oh Nick, I always did admire your sense of humor about that. - I'm sorry for interrupting your afternoon Miss McMurrich. - How could you be so rude? Nicholas. - Aw Nick don't mind. He's a sport. - Nicholas, I don't care about what happened to your hand. I mean, I do care. But I don't care. Do you know what I mean? - Good day, Miss McMurrich. - So mean. - Ah, he's just shy. You should see that boy shuffle a deck of cards with one hand. And he's bright too. Bright as a dollar, and honest as the day is long and I sure do admire him. Don't you? - Yes. I do. (horse neighing) - I haven't see you around camp for a few days. How ya keeping? What you need is some real exercise. You know what I've noticed about you? - What's that? - You don't talk much when you've got problems. I'm a lot like that myself. Looks to me like you've got a case of the screamin' abdabs. Demons. - I don't got any demons. - Everybody's got demons Nick. They are those little voices. You can't do it, you're not good enough. You don't deserve it. You know the ones, the ones that scream in your ear every time you think about doing anything risky. Hear 'em all the time, my own self. I should have done this, should have done that. I tell you, if I'd listen to 'em half the time, I'd be loonier than I am already. (bright music) - No word yet, but they're looking through a stack of old documents. About 16, 17 years back, you think? - Yeah, but I'm not really. Bear? - No, that would be snake. - No thanks. - What is this, rattler or bull? - Think I'll stick to machines. - That'd be a real good idea. For now. ♫ This is my Father's world ♫ And to my listening ears ♫ All nature sings and round-- - What is that? - A black horned pine borer, I think. - I don't think so. - Maybe not. - Nick. I'm really sorry Simon teased you. That really wasn't nice. - Don't worry about that. (birds singing) - You have a beautiful voice. Will you sing again? For me? Please. ♫ This is my Father's world ♫ And to my listening ears ♫ All nature sings and around me rings ♫ The music of the spheres ♫ This is my Father's world ♫ I rest me in the thought ♫ Of skies and seas of rocks and trees ♫ His hand the wonders wrought ("My Father's World") (frog croaking) - What is it? - You've never seen a chicken before? - Doesn't look like a chicken. - Poor thing. Probably just needs a good meal. - Are you sure? - It's what they eat. - Trees can talk? - That's what Aunt Olivia says. They're all alive. Each one has its own voice. - I can't hear them. - You have to know how to listen. (tree creaking) (gentle orchestral music) (tree creaking) How did it happen? - We lived in an old rooming house. I was too little to remember. They think somebody smoked in bed, and fell asleep. All I know is, every time I go near fire I get these feelings like I'm trapped in a box with no way out. Everything gets smaller and smaller. - How terrible. - They couldn't identify all the bodies. - One was your mother? - Yeah. That's what they think. - What about your father? - He must have figured I was dead too. I don't know. The man down at city hall, he told me he had a hunch O'Brien might be my name. - That's terrible to lose a mother. - What happened to yours? - Sort of the same. - How did it happen? You don't have to if you don't want to. - My father used to be sheriff here. Once a man he arrested got out of jail and broke into our house. He was drunk. Crazy. I was six then but pretty small. I remember my mother picked me up, started running down the stairs. I was bouncing up and down. My mother was crying. I can still feel her tears on my face. Then the man started shooting. - You are an angel. - Swamp angel. - Duncan. (horse neighing) - Watch the roll O'Brien. What's the matter with you? A careless man is a dead man around here, boy. You got no sense for the work, get out. - I've got the sense. - Is that so? - Plenty of it. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Then show me. - I made a mistake, I'm sorry. - You ever fall asleep at the switch around here again, and I'll boot you out so fast you'll wonder if you maybe never even left Chicago. Understood? - Yes sir. - Carelessness gets a man killed around here. - He sure is touchy about it. - He's got his reasons, same as you must have for doing such a stupid thing. - Hey Dunc, can I ask you something? A favor? You see, Angelica, Miss McMurrich, well she invited me to her birthday party next week, and I was kind of wondering. - All right, all right, I can spell you out there. - Thanks Dunc. ♫ Born like a vapor on this summer's air - Nicholas O'Brien. - Oh, Aunt Olivia, you must hear Nicholas sing. He has the most wonderful voice you've ever heard. - I'm not interested in singing. I'm interested in knowing on how you plan on getting those lumberjacks out of this forest. - Lumberjacks? - You know how to use that thing? - I can aim pretty good, but the actual shooting. - Give it to Angelica. - Quick, quick. - I don't think that's such a good idea. - Oh for Heaven's sakes, we're not gonna kill anybody. - We heard shots. Well, what happened? - We scared some men off. - You did? - Ah, well not me exactly. - Typical man, all the latest hardware, and no idea how to use it. - Well who was it? - Alar and some others. - Alar? - Yeah. - My own foreman? - Come on Angelica. - You did the shooting? - Yeah, and I'd blow your britches off too if I saw you out there with a saw. You're God's custodians, and as far as I'm concerned, he's the sole proprietor of this magnificent establishment. - Where are your custodians gonna live, if I don't put a roof over their heads? - Nature's sacred Thomas, all of nature. You know that. You're as stubborn as your father, God rest his soul. Hyah. (horse neighing) (fighting in tent) - Show your nose around here again Alar, and I'll cut it off. - You're wise to be afraid. The forest is a dangerous place. (mournful orchestral music) - All's the telegram said was, he got hold of Vancouver city records, and what with the transients on their way north to Alaska, and the orientals, there's a ton of paper to sift through. - Think he'll find anything? - Maloney's a stubborn old Scot. If it's there he'll find it. - I saw a grave up there. Mister McLean's father? - Yep. Terrible thing. - What happened? - Best to forget. - Forget what? - He wouldn't want me going on about it. - It would help me understand him. - Got caught in the cable. Burned half a mound before anyone knew. - There's more, I can tell. What else Duncan? I need to know. - Tom was operating the donkey. Figures he wasn't paying attention. Blames himself. Yeah, they were about as close as two men get. (birds singing) - I don't want to do it. But I will if I have to. Don't make me, please? Be a good kitty cat. Huh? - I warned you, about the forest. It's a dangerous place. - You're trespassing. - You, you (word in foreign language). You got me fired. - You got yourself fired. You're a thief and a traitor, Alar. (speaking in foreign language) Would you hurt a poor cripple, huh? Defenseless? - Then you should go on your way out of here. You have ruined my life. - You can play around with sticks here Alar, but if you come with a saw, and I may just forget about my disadvantage. - You have destroyed my life. I'll get you for this. You pay for this, you (word in foreign language). You stay out of my way, or I'll kill you. I'll kill you. - Why do you have to cut down all the big trees in the Limberlost? You said yourself, you grew up there. Doesn't that count for anything? - People gotta have homes. Farmers gotta have barns. Rivers gotta have bridges. - There's lots of other trees. The Limberlost seems so, it seems special. - To tell you the truth, I don't put much faith in special anymore. Here you go. Try this on. My father's matrimonial outfit. Grandfather's before him, all the way from Scotland. Put a little grease in your hair, and Bob's your uncle. - Feels kind of. - Wool's a bit scratchy, but you'll get used to it. Try that on. - If Mister McMurrich used to be sheriff, why can't he keep them out of Limberlost? - He said he's never put the badge on again, not after what happened. - You mean there's no law here anymore? - Closest is Moose Junction. - Well Tom. - Hello Jack. You know Nick here. - Hella day, how are you Nick? - Very well, thank you Mister Carter. - Punch Mister O'Brien? - Thank you, ma'am. - I understand you can sing. - Hello, Mister McMurrich. How do you do? My name's Nick O'Brien. - Oh, I know who you are. - Wonderful party. - And Tom McLean tells me you are bright and capable. A lot on the ball, is what he said. Is that a fair assessment? - I don't know, maybe. Sometimes. What are you doing out here in the bush? You should be in school. Education's the answer, it's the only way a man can amount to anything in this cruel world. - Well, excuse me Miss Pollard, could I have the pleasure of this dance? - You want to dance with me? (violin playing) (group applauding) - Oh there's Nick. I'm so glad you could make it. - Hello Angel. - Hi. - This is for you. Oh, how sweet. - Oh look, thule bunting I believe, oh my look at this. - Come on. - Black over green. - You didn't say anything did you? - Quiet everybody. Quiet please. Nicholas O'Brien's gonna sing for us. Go on, you're wonderful. They'll love you. - Okay. ♫ I dream of Jeannie with the light brown hair ♫ Borne, like a vapor, on summer air ♫ I see her tripping where the bright streams play ♫ Happy as the daisies that dance on her way ♫ Many were the wild notes her merry voice would pour ♫ Many were the blithe birds that warbled them o'er ♫ I dream of Jeannie with the light brown hair ♫ Floating, like a vapor, on the soft, summer air ♫ For she's a jolly good fellow ♫ For she's a jolly good fellow ♫ For she's a jolly good fellow ♫ Which nobody can deny (group applauding) - Howdy partner. - I want you to get it through your head I'm not your partner. - I'd keep your voice down if I were you, partner. - I've got nothing to do with you, and your crooked schemes. - You know, that's where you're wrong. You and me, we're tighter than a frog's vent. - I saw you out there, I don't ever want to see you come back. - Well I'm gonna tell McLean how you went and stole that map, Nicky boy. - I had nothing to do with that, and you know it. - Is that so? - I'm turning you in. - Nick, you turn me in, and I'm taking you down with me. You gonna stand up in a court of law, and swear on a stack of Bibles you never came into that office with me? And how'd you pay for that bicycle, huh Nick? You gonna tell the judge that I never paid you that two dollars? That was your share partner. Don't you remember? - You son of a-- - Whoa, better watch your language, choirboy. Otherwise, how's that sweet little angel? Yeah, she told me all about how you said you saw the halo on her head. Now ain't you just the sweetest talker. - I'm warning you. - My heart goes pitter-patter Nick. Almost as bad as when my lips first touched hers. - Break it up. (foreboding orchestral music) (birds singing) - You sure about this, Nick? - Yes sir. I'd better be on my way. Somebody's looking through city records right now. I may as well be there when they find him. - You're not running away from something are you? - No. - Nothing you want to tell me about why you got in that fight? - No sir. Just gotta find my home. - The boys'll be sorry to lose you. (bird cheeping) - I know. I know little chicken. But you'll be flying away soon, and then you won't. (men shouting) - Duncan! (thunder) (thunder) - Easy does it son. - What happened? - Smoke probably got to you. - I don't mean that. Something happened. I heard voices. - Heart stopped. Nothing any of us could have done. Lord, we ask you to receive our dear brother, Duncan Ross, to your paradise. I don't have much experience talking about this kind of thing. But, I just want you to know, to know, I loved this man. He was what you'd call a good man, right through to the bone. I don't figure how I could have got through some of the times. Anyway, we just want you to know that we're going to miss him. Life just won't be the same, without him spitting like a spider, and patching us all up the way he did, both inside and out. Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed by thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. - Hello Mister Sorry. - What do you want? - So sad about Duncan. - Yeah. (bird cheeping) You better take care of him. Shouldn't be much trouble. He's gonna be flying soon. - Looks like you're the one who's ready to fly. - Well I gotta get to Vancouver. - Nick, I don't care about what happened at my party. How my father feels. Any of it. - What do you care about? - The two of us being friends. - I can't. I just can't, I have to go. I've made up my mind. (bird cheeping) - I deserve more than a, so long nice knowing you. Don't I? - I need to find some place, some place that's mine. Some place I belong. - What is it? Where are you going? What happened? - They cut a tree. - Nick? - Must have done it last night. The fire. - Where did you go? - Something's wrong. - What do you mean? - Two trees got taken last night at the Limberlost. - Mister McLean. I've got to talk to you, Mister Mclean. Alone. You're right I should have spoken up. I should have told you all about it right away, but you trusted me, and I thought I could make it up to you by hard work and, I couldn't let you down. I don't know what got into me. - More than likely them screamin' abdabs. - If Simon set that fire, it's murder. - Yeah, the Marshall in Moose Junction's sending up a deputy. - Well how long will that take? - Two or three days. - Three days? Anything can happen in three days. - This is not your fight. - No sir, I believe it is. We can't sit around and let people hurt each other, we've gotta stop them. - You want your job back, is that what you're saying? - Yes sir, I guess that is what I'm saying. - Then do that, and let me take care of the rest. - But sir. - There's one other thing. - Dunc got news from Vancouver city records yesterday. But I guess you weren't up to being sociable. - He's been dead 10 years. - I'm sorry, Nick. - I guess it's over. The one looking anyway. That was the hardest part. The hoping. (frogs singing) (gentle orchestral music) (ragtime piano playing) (men laughing) (dramatic orchestral music) - So, we start here, 50 yards north of the gate. And move in here, and take these ones first. Then we move down here, west of Prospect Hill, and take these three here. - [Alar] How far do we skid the trees out? - 300 yards. - Seriously, it's on a slope. - All right? - All right. - [Simon] No worries. (pounding on door) - Hold your horses. Hold your horses. I'm coming. (pounding on door) What do you want? - Mister McMurrich, sir, you've got to reconsider becoming sheriff. - [McMurrich] Are you drunk? - No, but I am guilty. - Guilty, of what? - I was there when your office was robbed. - Get out of this house. - No sir, please, Tom McLean's life is in danger. - Come, come this way. (ominous orchestral music) - [Nick] Carter knows exactly what he wants, and he's got at least a dozen armed men out there, with equipment, wagons, a skid team, the works. Tomorrow morning, first thing, they're going up to Limberlost, and I don't know how to stop them, unless you-- - You did the right thing coming to me Nick. The deputy'll take care of this Simon fellow, don't worry. - It's not Simon I'm worried about. - The answer is no. - Two or three days will be too late. - It can wait till morning. - A lot of good men could get killed. - Good night Nick. - One thing, do you have another copy of the map of the Limberlost? - Tom has one in his strongbox, but the fire probably got it. It's the only other. No, I believe my sister made me give her one. - Thanks. You can't run away from your demons. Anywhere you go, anything you do, they know how to find you. Believe me, I know. - You're an impertinent young man, to disturb a lady at this hour. - You must know the Limberlost better than anybody. - Of course I do, but why should I give you my map? - What if I told you, Tom McLean's kind of taken with you. - Why would you tell me nonsense like that? - 'Cause I think you are with him too, almost as much as you are with the Limberlost. And if I had your map, I might be able to save both from being destroyed. Can you mark where the swamps are located? - You're a strange person. - So are you. (man snoring) (harmonica playing) (romantic music) - I know, little chicken. I know, you need somebody who knows how to shoot straight. - Find that McMurrich girl. We might need a little insurance. - Yes sir. - Mister Carter marked the trees you wanted to take out. So I remarked Miss Pollard's map, so the path crosses the swamp. All we have to do is. - You've done enough, Nick. We'll take care of it from here. - I have to go. - No. - It's the first time in my life, I ever felt I belong someplace, and I'm not about to let anybody come in here and take it away from me. (horse neighing) - Thanks Jimmy. (harmonica playing) - Move out here. - Olivia, have you seen Angelica? - [Olivia] I was expecting her, is something wrong? - She's taken the buckboard. - Out to the Limberlost? - Do you have your Bible handy? - Yes I do. (dramatic orchestral music) - Hi Angel. - What do you want? - Where's the gimp? - If you mean Nicholas, I haven't the slightest idea. What are you doing? - It's this way. - No no, I am sure we go through this way. - No, it's marked right here. - That doesn't make sense. - Come on. - Those are fresh. Angel's been through here. - Angel? - Miss McMurrich. You go on, I'll see where she is. - George, try to keep up. - I'm trying, if you walked less like a lumberjack, and more like a lady. - George W McMurrich, just what's wrong with you? - All right, let's get it over with. - All right, raise your right hand. Do you, George W McMurrich, as the sheriff of the city of Grafton Corners, do you swear to uphold the law, and to bring to justice criminals and ne'er-do-wells, whoever shall come across, as long as you both shall live? - That's not an oath of office. - It'll do, swear. - I swear. - Tom? - Mornin'. Sheriff. - Stuck in the swamp. - That's nowhere near here. (shouting) - [McMurrich] I'm law here Tom, and I'm a just man, you know me. We'll make sure he gets what's coming to him. - Tom. It was a mistake Tom. And I can explain. They forced me. I couldn't stop, Tom. - You and I know there's no bottom to the bog, Jack. Just one big hole, goes on and on. Comes out in China if you can hold your breath long enough. A lyin' gasbag like you ought to be able to manage that just fine. - Get me out of here. - Duncan's dead, that's murder in my book. - He had a heart attack, you told me yourself. - How could you do it, huh? We've been friends all that time. - It wasn't me. Get me out of here. - Gotta play 'em as they lay Jack. - As the sheriff of the city of Grafton Corners, I'm arresting you for trespassing, arson, manslaughter and theft, how do you plea? - Plea? What do you mean how do I plea? This is no court of justice. - Nope, you're right. Come on Tom, what do you say? Let's get on back to camp. Chow's about ready. - Where you going? Hey Tom, don't leave Tom. Okay, okay. I plead guilty. - Now don't you make a sound, you hear me? Ow! - Help, somebody! Somebody! Help me! - Let her go Simon. - Leave me alone right now Simon Wessner. Leave me alone. - Come on little lady, get up there. - Ow, Simon. Let go. - Come on girl. - Simon why, where are we going? - [Simon] Hyah, hyah. - Hey horsey. Are we good? - [Angelica] Simon. I'm getting off here right now. Stop Simon. - [Simon] Hyah, hyah. - No no, stop stop. Okay, now up. Okay come on, come on, giddyup. (Nick shouting) - Can he ride? (Nick shouting) - Yeah. - You're not gonna get away with this, Simon Wessner. - Just you watch me, Angel. - [Angelica] Let me go. - [Simon] I don't think so, sweetie pie. - You're hurting me, let me go. - I do believe we are on top of that. Enough. - Whoa whoa whoa. - Simon! - [Angelica] In here Nick. Nick, he tied me up. - Time to go, Simon. - Now now, don't cause such a fuss. Everybody'll be happy ever after. - I can't do that. - Why not? - You started that fire, I found your knife. - Nick! Nick help me. Nick it's burning. Nick! Nick it's on fire. Get me out of here. Help me Nick. - Well done, son. - Bob's my uncle. The Limberlost is so beautiful, so special, it has strange powers like you said. You can't cut it all down. I don't know what I'm trying to say. It's just, you're right about it being a bank but, maybe it's not money that's in the vault. Maybe it's worth more than that. - Well, I'm not about to lose sight of where my own roots grew, but I'm not gonna put men out of work, or tell the country to stop growing. - Then you'll preserve it? - Only if there's a McLean to take over that side of things. Know anybody short a name? Needs a job? Nicholas John Ross McLean. How's that for the books? - I'd be proud. - Nicholas. I think it's time. - Off you go, little chicken. - Did Nick call that screech owl a chicken? Is that what he said? That boy, such an ignoramus. - Well what do you expect? He's a McLean. - You really want to know? - What? - What I expect? - Yes. Yes, I do. - Well, I might as well get it over with. Well I knew I'd have to do that, I don't know why it's always the women that have to lead the way. (romantic orchestral music) - Guess I was wrong. - About what? - Wishes.
