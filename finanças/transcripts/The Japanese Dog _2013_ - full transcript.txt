Mr. Costache! -Hello, Mr. Costache! -What do you want, Daniel? -Help me out, man. -I got nothing. Come on, Mr. Costache! I don't want much. I haven't even got enough for cigarettes! I got nothing, didn't you hear me? -You got nothing? -Nothing! -You know you do! You know... -How do I know that? The aid you got yesterday... for being a flood victim. -Like you didn't get the aid. -I didn't, man! You're not a flood victim. You're just dumb. You'll drink yourself to death, man! You drown your money in alcohol. -You've got booze for brains! -Are you gonna help me out or what? -And see my money in five weeks. -No, tomorrow. -Tomorrow? -Yes. OK, hang on. -God bless you, Mr. Costache! -Yeah, right. The Lord keep you... Raducu! -Got candles? -I've got a few left. Show me! -These two. -Two... Give them here. -Where's your Dad? -Getting supplies. -When will he be back? -I don't know. -Got light bulbs? -Yes. Give me... three. How much? -I'll get going. Bye! -Get the right change. Sure I will. Costache, have you got water? Ghiță's going to the fountain. I've got enough, thanks. How about some milk? I milked the cow. No milk, Leanca, thanks. Don't want any. I got you milk, Costache. Say "God bless". God bless! Look what's left of Mirescu's house. It's like they never lived here. And they had such a nice house. They always had something good for the guests. Remember, Costache? Yes, I remember... They left and didn't take anything with them, poor them... Mr. Costache! Hello, Mr. Costache! Gabi! What is it? -Your pension's here. -Wasn't it due tomorrow? I started at this end of the village. Here, count it. Yeah, OK. -Still no electricity? -Still no bloody electricity. I found this in the attic. And I got you a bottle of lamp gas. -Where did you find this? -Lying around in the attic. The hell you did. It's new! Gabi, if I want charity, I'll ask. Don't get upset, Mr. Costache. I was ashamed to ask for money. -If you don't want it, don't take it. -I do, I do. I'm tired of candlelight. How much? -I can't remember. -Sure you do. Thirty. Thirty? It's too much. I'm not taking it. Here, 30. Ten... Twenty... Thirty. And five for the gas. There's a letter for Maria. -From whom? -Ticu. What do you mean, Ticu? It's from New Year's. They must have mislaid it. -Maria used to come take the letters. -Yeah, I know. What is it, girl? What do you want? Did I ask you to wait like a moron? Hello, Vasile! -I was thinking to come see the land. -Cheers, Mr. Costache! Good afternoon. I'm Mihai Rădulescu. This is the director of the Electricity Company, who's going to help you. The Mayor told me about your troubles. What can I say, we need to carry on... But don't worry, we'll fix the electricity problem. -You do have electricity in the house. -Yes, I do, I do. And I hope, so to speak, everything works out fine and everybody is happy. Mr. Director already bought the land from Fieroiu and Țamploi. Right next to your piece of land. -They got good money for it. -Yeah... He would like to buy your land, too. Didn't you say it's no use for you? Mr. Director, can you come here? I want to show you what the problem is. One second... You see, from mid parcel down... there's a problem, because the land is very soft. It retains water and we can't build on it. That's on the opposite side of the access, you see? -So then we need to grit. -Yes? -But we'll need a lot of grit. -How much? About 100-150 cubic meters for each parcel. -How much is that? -About 1200 cubic meters of grit. So it's very much. We could build the foundations deeper. But I still think we'll have problems with waterproofing. So what I propose is to align everything... -I'll be waiting for the electricity then... -Yes, yes, of course! -Cheers, Mr. Costache! -Cheers! In the lower part, where the gardens will be, we should make some drainage systems... I see, I see... -Hello. -Hello, Mr. Costa... -Is Mr. Mayor here? -Inside. Come in, Mr. Costache! Hello. Sit down. -You're here for the land, right? -Yes. Here it is. Sign here and it's yours. Another thing. Ticu called a couple of days ago. And yesterday, too. I told him about Maria, he knew nothing. He's coming next week. You can call him from here. He gave Gabi his number. Mr. Costache, what happened? Are you sure you connected them? -Still not working? -Nope. The kid didn't come home for two days. My wife told me he was at a friend's. I went to their house and Victor, his colleague, told me Ionut wasn't talking to me and I should come back another day. "Victor, my boy, tell Ionuț I'm not budging until Ionut comes home." And I didn't budge. I sat there, on the steps. -Check now. -Did he come out, you think? Mr. Costache! Check now. -Nope. -Not working. I'm coming! I sat on those steps all night. He came out around six with his backpack. He walked right past me without a glance. So I followed him home. And in the elevator he said: "Dad... "... if you touch Mom again I'll kill you and turn myself in." Check now. So thanks for the booze... But I'm not drinking ever again. Cheers! I'm going. -Thank you. -Bye. There you go, Costache. -A bit short at the sleeves, but OK. -Yeah. Now you can go dressed up to the church. OK, thanks a lot. I've stopped going. It's too hard for me. I have to stand there. I'm not feeling well. Take an aspirin. Why don't you? That's not it. I dreamt about Maria. Don't get upset. I won't. Why should I? I dreamed she was calling me out at the gate. So I went out. She talked to me and I couldn't hear her. I wanted to open the gate, but couldn't find it. She just gave me a nasty look and walked away. Costache, have a memorial service for her. I'll help. -Hello! The Mayor's waiting. -Hello, Gabi. Come in, Mr. Costache. I was expecting you. Hello. I was just telling the director, you finally have electricity. -He put in a good word. -Anyway, good thing it's done. -Hello, Mr. Costache. -Coffee? No, thanks, I had coffee at home. At least sit down so we can talk. -Well... -Here you go... What's there to talk about? That's funny. Aren't you here for the land? I brought the notary too, to make sure everything's alright. Hello, Mr. Costache! So. Two euros per square meter. The price for the area. -How much is that? -Six thousand euros. That's 250 million lei at today's exchange rate. Plus I'm covering all the other expenses. -So, what do I have to sign? -In the book here... For the deed, so you can sell the land. Here, Mr. Costache. The deed and here's the purchase contract. 250 millions... OK. Come on, Mr. Costache... 2.5 euros per square meter, but that's as high as I can go. -That's 315 millions. -300 millions. It's much beyond the area's price. What can I do with all that money? Have it stolen or something? Nah... Let me think about it... and we'll talk again. Hey, doggie, doggie! Come, come! Eat! Come on! Look, Costache! I'd bought them for the funeral, but then I thought they'd just rot in the closet. At least I'll break them in for the afterlife. Ghiță, come here. I chose the pointiest one. I want to beat Ghiță. Let's clink eggs. Me first. -Christ is risen! -Christ is risen! Now eat it. -Have some cake, too. -Thanks! Have some, Costache. Mr. Costache, why don't we clink eggs? Christ has risen! You broke it. What can you do? You do a bit of everything, if you're lucky. No one's laying the table for you there. -Were you abroad a long time? -Quite a bit. Italy, France, Spain... All over Europe. Why didn't you stay there? All kinds of problems. Problems? I thought I'd go there, work and mind my own business, but you can't. Everybody steals, Mr. Costache. There's no other way. -Will you go back? -Sure. What would I do here? -So you lost everything in the flood? -Everything. I heard Ticu's coming home. The whole village has heard. You know how it is here, if one sneezes, everyone says "Bless you". If Ticu comes home, why won't you sell the land and help him out? -Ghiță, man... -You can't start digging now. Don't you have things to do? Why don't you mind your business? What did I say? Why are you mad? That's enough, already. Wait, man. I don't have a dog in this fight, I don't care. I'm not selling. Y'all get it? I'm not selling! And now you're yapping at me, like it's your business. -I was just saying. -You were just saying... OK, enough! Go away! Enough already! Koji! Koji! Hello! How are you, Dad? Hello. Icocco and Paul? Hiroko. Hiroko! Hiroko? And Paul is also called Koji. -Hiroko and Paul Koji. -Right. -Does Paul speak Romanian? -Sure. Not perfectly, but you can understand each other. -Oh yeah? -Yeah. How old are you? -Tell him, how old are you? -We are seven. -I am seven. -Seven years old... -I am seven. -Seven years old... -You've had a long trip here, right? -Long enough. We left yesterday. -What did he say? -He wants to go out. You can sleep in the other room. Yeah... Here. -Apologize to grandpa! -What for? No need, really. I got it for him. I forgot about them. It's very good. It's gingerbread. -Gingerbread. -Gingerbread, yes. There's something wrong with the leg. -What? I'll check, Dad. -No no, it's OK. Let me. How long have you been here? About three weeks. The Mayor said they put you up in the school at first. Yes, he gave me a small room there. Koji, come on... -I'll go get some more luggage in. -OK. Here we go. I put the potatoes in, now we're waiting for them to bake. -Do you go to school? -No. No? Koji! I'll just go across the street to get some milk. I'll be right back. Do you want to come with me? -Go with grandpa. -Come on, come with me. The leftovers from the house... after the flood passed. Why didn't you say anything? I didn't know what to say. You used to talk with your mother. I didn't know how... Come on, Dad. You could have gone to the town hall and made a phone call. I didn't know how, son. -God rest her soul. -God rest her soul. Here, have some koliva. -God rest her soul. -God rest her soul. -It's good. -Yes. "Aren't you ashamed to pick on him? Can't you see you're twice his size?" And he goes: "I didn't do anything! He started it!" But she wouldn't hear of it. She kept on. I couldn't have picked on him, she said. Couldn't he see how small I was? Two days later, I come home with a bloody nose again. I go straight to her and say: "Mommy, look what he did to me." And suddenly she slapped me dumb. She knew right enough who was starting it. You were hanging out with Remus's kids. They were naughty. Coming here, whistling... Your mother would go out: "What do you come here whistling for?" I was so ashamed. So ashamed... I don't know what she told Remus's older son, but he wouldn't speak to me for two weeks. They'd cross the street when they saw me. When you married this girl... she called Vasile, Ghiță, Grigore, everyone. She had a bit to drink and you couldn't get her to stop talking about kimonos and samurais... She wanted to celebrate your wedding. And when you went into constructions... she got really upset. She wanted you to be a school teacher there, at least. But what could you teach them over there? Unbelievable! And that dog? What does it do? It's a robot. A gift from Grandma. -A gift from your grandma? -Yes. -It doesn't speak Japanese. -No. How long will you be staying? A couple of days. Then we have to go back. Koji has a test. -What grade is he in? -Second grade. Does he like it? He likes it. He likes everything except his mother being his teacher. -Hiroko is a teacher, then? -Yes. That's how we met. She taught me how to write. It must be hard with all those signs. I'd been there for four years and could barely write correctly. So, do they like it here? I think so. Gabi... I wanted to talk to you and say I was sorry... Come on, Ticu. It doesn't matter anymore. Sure it does. -Let me explain. -I don't want to. Better tell me what it's like over there. What was it like when you got there? And I thought, I have to stay put. If they cut my legs, if they carry me away, I still won't budge. I sat and sat, sweaty like hell. They talked, clinked cups and I just nodded. I can't remember a thing they said. At the end the people got up to leave, and I just couldn't feel my legs. At all... Paralyzed. They just looked at me like, aren't you getting up? In the end they pulled me up by the arms and took me to the car. And I thought, there goes my job. But they thought it was funny... and they hired me. I'm still not completely used to sitting like that. He likes it here a lot. -Do you like it? -Yes. Ticu told me about the village. I too born in village faraway from Tokyo. Did Ticu meet your parents? Your mother, father? Just mother. Father dead long ago and Ticu never met. -I'm sorry. -No, long ago. Is your mother living with you? She lived with us two years, then went back because she doesn't like city. Grandpa, have you seen Koji? No, maybe he went to the other room. Koji! Where are you? Koji! Koji! -He's not here. Where could he be? -No? Maybe he is out in the yard, then. OK, then grandpa and I can go to bed and Koji can sleep outside. Boo! There he goes... Up to the top. -Do you need anything else? -Yes. Come on down. Come on, let's eat. Come on, get down. Come here. Koji, dinner! -Where is he sitting? -Let him sit here. -Where are you sitting? -Here. Tokyo, at home. -Whom are you here with? -My cousin. -He's dressed in these clothes for... -Karate. Karate? Right. Evening in Tokyo. Dad makes building. What is it? A construction site? Koji small. You were so small here. Mom and Dad and Koji in airport. Colleagues and music. Yeah... -Who's here? -Samurai Daddy. Samurai Daddy? Mom and Koji in Tokyo park. Let's have one with Grandpa. Should we take a photo? Sure. We'll ask Daddy to take a photo and you'll put it in here with these ones. OK. Here? -Dad and Koji on the dinosaur. -Right, on the dinosaur... Here, see? Here's the best spot. And it's far from the water. -And you can see the whole lake! -Wait a second. If you want, we can raise the land by a couple of meters and have a garden in the valley. Vegetables, apple trees, pear trees, whatever. It's good, fertile land. -Good for flowers, too. -Come on, what's all this? You think I'm moving back here? No, I wasn't talking about now. Later, in a year or two... Dad, I live there. How do you expect me to just up and move here? -I wasn't saying that. -What were you saying? -How could I move here? -Did I say you should move here?! Dad... -Good evening. -Good evening. -Drink? -No. Then... -Do you remember my son? -Sure I do. The Japanese. He's an engineer. Good for him! -Come on home. -Give me a break, son. I'm just having a drink with Danilă. What's the harm? I haven't had a quiet drink since I don't know when. How long since I had a drink, Danilă? -A long time. -A long time, but how long? I told you. Long ago. Tell me, when did I last have a drink? When? What do you look at him for? When did I last have a drink? When you fought with Tudorel. Good. -When I fought with Tudorel. -Yes. -Remember that? -Sure I do, I was there. Tell us, how was it? Well... -You were sitting quietly at a table... -Yes. Sitting quietly. Tudorel came in and picked a fight. But why? We were friends. -We were in the army together. -I don't know, man. Tell me! Why hold back, man? Come on, how did he pick on me? He said you were a motherfucking asshole. -He did, didn't he? -Yes. That you messed Gabi up. Right. That we messed Gabi up... So what did I do? You got up... and pushed him away. He fell and people here had to stand him up. Right... And? And he came back and you punched him. -And he fell again. -Right. And they took you and sat you in a chair, seeing as how you were mad... But you just went home. -Right. -But Tudorel was just fine, you know. Just fine. -See? You remembered. -Sure I remembered. -Sure you remembered. -Absolutely. Dad, get in the car. Let's go home. Come on, get in! Dad! Where are you going? Your mother and I just stared at each other, open-mouthed. -She said it was me. Because of me. -No, Dad. No. Then we thought it was Gabi... I thought she gave you cold feet. At least you should have told her. -Why did you propose if you were leaving? -I didn't know. To mess with her... that's why you proposed. What do you want now, Dad? Didn't I try to explain so many times? Didn't I write? Didn't I call? Didn't I try to talk to you? You never went to the village phone to make a call. I left like an idiot. I'm sorry. But you could have given me a sign in all this time. You want me to explain now, apologize? Get everyone over here and live like one big happy family? I was scared, that's all I remember. And Mom knew. I talked to her before I left. I wasn't sure myself, and she didn't believe me. She never told me. It seems we don't communicate much in this family. Dad, I came here to take you with me. -Take me with you? -Yes. If not now, then later. I don't know, Ticu. I don't know. Sit down here. Sit down. There you go. Let me take these off. Easy does it. What are you doing? How are you, Koji-boy? How are you doing? Off to bed, everyone. Come on, up. Are you taking this off? He likes it. -Did you get everything? -Yes, we did. -You didn't forget anything? -Nope. Let me check. -Bye, Koji boy. -Give Grandpa a kiss. Koji! Come here. Bye. -I talked to the Mayor. Think about it. -OK. He takes care of you. Right, I'll take care of him, too. Go on. Go, it's late. -What are you doing here, Răducu? -Homework. You still have time for school? Grigore replaces me and I go to school then. -Are you left-handed? -Yes. So, have you given it more thought? Hello? Hi! Fine. Yes, OK. Yeah, he's here. I'll put him on. Bye, Ticu. Cheers. Ticu, hello? No, no. I just wanted to make sure you made it home alright. Everything OK? Have you gone back to work? Good. And Koji? How's Koji-boy? Oh yeah? Can you put him on? Koji? How are you, Koji-boy? Good, good. He asks about you all the time. Yes. Yes, Koji. OK, Koji-boy. Bye. Ticu? What? Yeah, you told me. I'm thinking, sure I'm thinking. OK, OK. Say hi to Hiroko for me. OK. Bye. Bye. Here... something for the road. -What's this? -Just say "God bless". God bless! Here it is. Have a good trip, Costache. God help us. -Take care! -Take care! Easy does it... Stay here, it's OK. -Shall we, Mr. Costache ? -Yeah, yeah, sure. Let me help you. -Hello. -Hello. Have a good trip! God help!
