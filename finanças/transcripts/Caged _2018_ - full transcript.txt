- Mummy? I want my Mum. Help. Please. Hello? Hello? Hello? Help. No, no, no, no. No, please, please, help. Help. Help. Please don't, let me out. Let me out. Why am I here? Let me out. Help. Hello. Hello. Shush, it will do no good. - Help. Help. Please. What have I done? Can you let me out? Help. Please. No. Please. Let me out. No. Help. Get off. Help me. No, no. No, no, no, no, no. No. Help. Are you okay? - I'm fine. I notice that bruise on your side. Stop me if I'm being too nosy. - I fell. - Chloe, does it look like I was born yesterday? - How do you know my name? - It's written on your badge. - Oh, yeah. - Sure you're okay? - Thought you said it's really none of your business. - Why are you so nervous? - I have to go and see the boss, Hector. - Something tells me he's not in today. Really? - Yeah, I overheard. Somebody else is here, JP. He's not the boss, he's the owner. - JP, I think I met him once before. It's my first day. Any advice? - Get a different job, or go back to wherever you're from. Unless you like clearing up puke and dirty laundry. - Hmm, two of my favorite things. - Chloe. Can I see you please? Got a list of people to see and things to do today, Chloe. Hector doesn't seem to be around. Have you heard from him? - No. - The last time he spoke to me he mentioned your name. Do you know why? - No. - No? - No. - Hector may have mentioned something about an opportunity, about making a little extra cash. He said to me you could use some extra funds? No, really don't know what you're talking about. - Hector told me everything, Chloe. Your drug habit, your gambling and now your debts. I checked on the company accounts and there has been a payment approved. A small transaction to your account and a small loan from Hector. Four thousand Euros. - Well, I just needed that to pay my rent. - Yes but you used it to pay for something else. Didn't you? Don't be alarmed Chloe. It's just I don't want anyone knowing about your indiscretions. And, I'd rather keep my reputation intact. I know how you girls gossip. Let me show you something. You must understand Chloe, that some of our clients expect absolute discretion. We're a VIP cleaning company and we take our non-disclosure agreement very seriously. So how do you think it looks? What have you got to say for yourself Chloe? - Look, I really, really need this job. I settled the value of that item personally. It was worth fifteen thousand Euros. I should call the police, get a nice stay in a prison cell. Unless we can work something out. - Well, just tell me what you want me to do and I'll do it. - Can I trust you not to tell anyone about this? - Yes, yes, you can trust me. I promise. - There is a way that you can pay off that debt. - By this time tomorrow, we could all move on from this. So, walk out of the door and I'll call the police. Or, do as I ask and we can agree that your debt will be clear. You can keep your job and these little indiscretions can be forgotten about. - What do you want me to do? I want you to appear in one of my films, Chloe. Your fee will be twenty thousand Euros. So that's enough to clear your debt and perhaps something to get you back on your feet again. - Well, what is it, like porn? - No, wow, phew, no I don't make that kind of film, Chloe. What do you take me for? - I'm sorry, it's just with the key in the door and the camera and the stuff I thought you were gonna... - God, no, no, Chloe, no. Oh, phew, I'm trying to... I'm trying to help you not make things worse. - Sorry. - But please, stop apologizing. Look, why don't you... Why don't you have a read of the script and then you decide. Yeah? Okay. I'm trying to develop as a film maker. Some of what I do is a little risky. But I'm trying to push the artistic boundaries, you know, push the envelope a bit. I can't let this out of my sight. Been writing it for a while now. Here. Thanks again for taking part in my film. Yet, this idea came from one of our members. He was willing to pay, well, twenty thousand Euros to watch it, so naturally I thought it best to sort out some fresh talent for him. Hah, hah, that thing, hah, hah, that's right, I can see you. Probably got around 12 hours of battery life which is probably more time than you have left, Chloe. Hah, hah, umm I told you you'd clear your debt by tomorrow, Chloe. I love it, you're like a, a dog. Trapped. Like a poor little puppy ready to mount the summer sun. You won't get out. You won't get out. Don't do that, Chloe. Might be a bit stupid to use all your energy. You might need it. As soon as the sun comes up, it should take between, three, four hours for you to die. A strong girl like you, maybe a bit longer. - Hello. Oh, I'll let you know how many views we're getting. Chloe, I'm back. I'd rest if I were you, Chloe. It's like I said, big day tomorrow. Yeah, Hector said you were a good choice. He never liked you, said you weren't very good at cleaning any of those houses. Well, I told him that we could use you one day for something better. And, here we are. You're not the first Chloe and you won't be the last. Oh yeah, I'm told the difference in temperature from the inside to the outside can be in excess of thirty degrees. And it's gonna be a hot one tomorrow. Sleep tight. Come on, put on a good show for me. It's no good Chloe, but it is entertaining. - I'm gonna call the police, okay? - Okay, thank you. - I'll be back in a sec. Hello, yes, hello. Umm, I'd like an ambulance and the police please. Someone has arrived here very distressed and possible heatstroke, sunstroke and dehydration, I don't know. Hold on. Okay, it's Banos zero zero four four zero zero Al-Hama D MaGall. Okay. - What happened to your foot? Hello? Your foot? - Oh, long story. What happened to you? - How long did they say? I can't remember. I'm not sure they did say. Aah, speak of the devil. - Close the door, close the door, close the door. Can you open the door, please miss? - Please do not open the door. - Why? - That's the man who put me in the car. - A police officer? - Yes, the police. - This is getting silly now. - Close all the shutters, now. Look, I know you don't know me, but he's lying. Look, I haven't tried to hurt you, I haven't tried anything. - What about the uniform? - Don't know. He must've planned this. - That's it Chloe, keep breathing. In and out. Good. I'm sure you're wondering about this place. This is one of ours as well. And the phone call, well, automatically diverted to my phone. Clever isn't it? Might have been more convenient though if you'd have died out in the desert but then again, this is probably better. I can make a sequel, see. Dumm, Dumm. In a world where Chloe survives. - It's still a pretty warm night. - Do you have the time or what time do you have? Maybe my phone's an hour ahead or behind or something. Sorry. I'm kinda short sighted. - Oh, I'm sorry, me too. I can't see shit any more. 9:15. - Oh, okay, thanks. Well, I'd better head back to the bar and wait for my friend. I think I've been stood up. - Let me get you another. Drown your sorrows. - I have a confession. Yes? - I don't really like martini, I just thought it looks cool. So, you know I don't want to sit here looking like a douche. I would like another drink though. - They know me here. We can drink anything you like. - Oh, I'm torn. If I have another, I can't drive. - Stay here. Drive in the morning. Stay for a moment. You'll make an old man happy. Tell me about yourself while we drink and I shame your friend for abandoning you. - Let's get fucked up. You know what? I think I'm gonna turn this thing off. She's not coming. I've heard nothing from her. She's left me here, all alone, by myself. Just me. - Perfecto. - Gracias. I'll be back in two. - I wait for you. - It was really nice of you to get me a room, Hector. Anything for you. - I get the impression the barman doesn't like you. He's just jealous. - Oops, wrong number. I want to see you get to your room safely. - It's okay, I'll find it. I'm not encouraging you to come any further, Mr Ramirez.. Honey, I don't need encouragement. - I'm half your age. It's just a number. So? Meet me for breakfast before you show me the stables. Aren't you a naughty one. You're a bad influence, Hector. It's okay. Night cap? - You know what, I have something for you Hector. You'll like it. Do you know much about baseball, Hector? - Baseball? In this case, it's just a metaphor. Three strikes and you're out. I went to get my stuff. I wasn't gone too long though. Hope you didn't miss me too much. You've been out of it for a while. Takes a while to load huh? Isn't it amazing what you can find in a hotel kitchen? Aah, there we go. Now. This can go one of two ways for you. Password please. I notice you were left handed. Sinister. It means touched by the devil. Know much about Latin? I'm right handed so what does that say about me? It means I can hit you so hard, your cute little nose will go through your brain. Believe me, I've done that a few times before. Now, password please. Good, now step one. My friend, the hotel manager downstairs, wants a lot of money from you. He's had enough. No more little girls for you to abuse in this place. I told you he did not like you, he just didn't know what to do about the problem. After all, the hotel's reputation could be at stake, which would not be good for business. The enemy of my enemy is my friend so, here's the account number. Transfer all your funds please or I'll begin to break you. One bone at a time. And I'll tell you, your loving family will be devastated when they find out. Think of the reaction. Hola. Okay. Gracias. You did good. Okay. Step two, it's your choice now. What are you gonna do about all those heartbroken girls whose lives you have wrecked? Tell me, do you remember Marie Gomez? Maria told me this is where you'd bring her, almost in plain sight. Her and others. You threaten them, you abuse them, and those who wouldn't tow the line, well, some of those went missing didn't they, Hector? What did you do with those girls? Where are they? So, do I break your neck, do I push through, or option three? I'll be right back. I don't wanna ruin this dress. I did promise the manager I wouldn't make too much of a mess, but you never know with these kinda things. Hi, me again. Oh, I almost forgot. I had to tell your stupid bitch friend that she probably won't be at work tomorrow. You'll be out of the office for the next few days. Hmm, Alina, Rea, whoops, the wrong one. Aah, Benita. I've heard so much about you, Benita. Hey, just buy me a nice little number. I'll be out of the office for the next few days. What's she like by the way? I mean how did you guys end up working together? Where did these missing girls go, Hector? Don't worry, I'll find out soon enough. I'm meeting her tomorrow. I've really got my outfit and everything. Did you choose the color Hector? I gave you every chance to prove me wrong. When a girl says, "I'm stranded "and my friend has stood me up," any normal guy would say, "How can I help?" Maybe get a cab or just give up and leave well alone. And when I said meet me for breakfast, that doesn't translate to "can I have some cocaine please?" I bet you didn't think little Maria Gomez would come back to haunt you, did you? Oh, reply. Benita says JP will cover for you. Who's JP? Okay, what's good about option three is it's really gonna hurt you and I can watch the life drain out of you knowing justice is done. Let me show you. I'm going to make an incision. Oh my god, I'm sorry. I'm gonna stab you here, piercing your diaphragm and pushing through. That way, you don't make too much noise. Then that's pretty much it for the knife. The rest is old school. Analog. By hand. Call it whatever. There it is. Fuck you. Yep, yep, you can come and get him now. Maybe call me a cab too. Yep, pleasure doing business with you. It's my first day, any advice? - Get a different job, or go back to wherever you're from. Unless you like cleaning up puke and dirty laundry. - Hmm, two of my favorite things. - Chloe. Can I see you please? - Hola. - I did that this morning. Is there anything that will get that out? You don't talk. Hi, me again. Do you remember Maria Gomez? - Who? - Maria Gomez. She used to clean for you. You didn't treat her too well, did you? She told me you made her do things she really didn't wanna do. She told me everything. All the gory details. - Who are you? - She was caught in possession of some drugs which were meant for you, some of that special happy white powder that you asked for. And got locked up. And then she met me. I was caught stealing. It's okay though, I'm much better at it now. They won't catch me again. She told me about your naughty ways, and what you did to all your cleaners and they were all too scared to tell anyone. Or, too embarrassed. Anyway, the point is she was fucked. Her brain was scrambled because of what you did. And you know what? She didn't deserve that. She was a nice girl. She couldn't take the guilt but it was all somehow her fault so she killed herself in prison. I liked her and when she died I was down one cell mate. I get lonely. But, luckily, I didn't have much time left to serve so, now I'm here to make sure justice is done. - What do you want? - Can you see that? It's Hector. I crushed his black heart. Maria went to him for help. - I have money. A lot of it. I'll pay you. - What for? Oh, for the cleaning. Yeah, I don't think I can get that stain out. Can you give Maria her life back? - No. Please. - Where is this money? - There's a house, we all use it. Under the floorboards in the bedroom. In a safe. At JP's place. Please. - I've heard the name JP a few times. - He's the one. Whenever there's trouble, whenever the girls get out of hand, he makes them disappear. Please. I'll take you to him. - I don't think you'll be skipping any time soon. What are you gonna do, introduce us? "Hey JP, this is Maria's friend Eve." Is that what you're gonna do? - Please. One four, one four, passcode. I know the combination to the safe. - Oh, well, I can open a safe easy enough. You see, when I was caught, it was a bit of a wake up call for me. I needed to hone in on my skills clearly. I thought I was good enough to stay in the shadows. I like stealing. But I'm no master thief. I realize that when I ended up in a Spanish prison. Whoops, unlucky for me. Really unlucky for you. My real area of expertise... Hold on, let me show you. When that stuff I gave you wears off, you'll be in a lot of pain. I broke your ankles. These, these are my favorite. I've never been caught at what I'm really good at. Now, option one. Nice and quick. Option two, I put you on my knee and break your fucking spine. Option three, slow and painful. Or, option four. We'll see now, won't we. - Four, four, oh god. - Uno, dos, tres, cuatro. Oh, this is a good one. I have a confession. This isn't my first time. Hmm, perfect. Mini bar? Mini bar? Mini bar. No. Yes. Hi, balcony girl. - Hi. - What's your name? - Jess. - Hi, Jess. Eve. You look blue. Boy problems? Not girl problems? - No, came here to get away. Asked my friend to come with me but she was the problem. Shit sack. Nut sucks. Fuck him and her. - Yeah. Drink, Jess? Mini bar's a bit pricey. - It's okay, I'm buying. - Oh, more than fine, yeah. Thanks. - Yup. What are you gonna do now? - I really don't know. - Well, if you wanna come over, me and my friend Charlie would be happy to cheer you up. - Is Charlie asleep? - Something like that. Room service. I didn't order any room service. - Wow, your room, it's, it's same as mine. - No, really! Nice to formally meet you. Don't think about it, just do it. - There's so much more in them than you think. Oh fuck. - You alright? - Shit, is that what I think it is? - You wanna find out? - What's this? - That's none of your biscuits. - Where do you get all of this stuff? - If you must know, I took it. Well, some of its mine but none of that matters. It's my standard every day carry. Look with your eyes, Jess. Gees. - Sorry. Aren't you afraid of getting caught? - No. Truth or dare? You're very odd, Eve. Anyone ever tell you that? - All the time. What? - The bar's closed. Pretty soon we'll be out of booze, so how about it? How about what? - Let's get some more. - How? - I'll show you, come on. Now what? Gimme your shoelace. - Not wearing any shoes. - Well, go and get them. - Oh. - Go get some booze. - What? - And be quiet about it. You already have a head start. Go. What are we doing? We're escaping the scene of the crime. We're fugitives. You're the criminal mastermind and I'm just the getaway driver. I can't believe this, I feel so bad. You shouldn't. It's on par with stealing a pen from a bank. If I'd done it, I'd be shitting through the eye of a needle. That's not funny. We've got to get away quick. Come on, I think I hear sirens. Sssh, can you hear that? - Anal gravy, Jess. My guts would be turning. I'd be sick to my stomach with panic and fear. Shittin' kittens. It's okay, Jess, we can pay for those miniatures if it makes you feel any better. - Shittin' kittens? - Sideways. - Where we going? - See some awesome shit. - Wow! I mean wow! - Cheers. It's okay. I haven't done it in a while but sometimes you gotta let loose. - I can't believe I just did that. - We need to document this moment in time. Jess, the criminal mastermind, off her face on Class As, jilted by her boyfriend, goes on a stealing spree and ends up in Spanish prison for the next ten years, sucking on an old woman's teat and performing sexual favors. - Just take the picture. - Nice. Didn't think you'd be doing that tonight, did you? - No, I did not. - Choose. - Sweet. - Feeling any better? - Much better. Thank you. Pleasure. - So you know my story. What's your story Eve? I'm here because of a friend who died. - Oh shit! - Yeah, I know, it's okay really. Maria Gomez. She was nice. What happened? - She killed herself. So now I'm here to sort out a few things for her. You know, loose ends on her behalf. - Well, I could do with some company on this trip. I'm staying at this massive villa all on my own, just out of spite. I was gonna have my friend come with me but obviously, no. - Not at the hotel? - No, no that's just a night because I couldn't get a flight until tomorrow. So, I'm just there tonight and then on to this villa tomorrow. - I'll come with you. - Awesome. - So, in the spirit of sharing, can you keep a secret seeing as you told me some stuff that's pretty raw and close to the heart? - Truth or dare. - Good idea. Dare. - I dare you to down that. - That was super easy. You suck at this already. - Alright, truth. - Okay, truthfully, would you take back this guy whose clearly an idiot, even though he's run off with your best friend? - I think I would. - No, Jess, no. Okay, truth. - What's your special talent? Is it stealing things? I've never met a thief before. I'm not a thief. I kill people. I can't tell if you're joking. - Don't worry, you're not on the list. - Wow! I thought you were going to say skipping or something. - Skipping. Although I am quite the skipper, not in the sea captain sense though. - This is turning into such a weird night. I like it. - Good, I'm glad. - How many? - You don't wanna know. - Double figures? - Definitely. - Shit! The bed. - Truth. - What? - Are you as cold as I am? - More so, it's freezing out here. So is Eve your real name then? - It sure is. Eveline Constantine. - What? - I know, awesome right. - How did you find out about your special talent? - My dad sort of helped me. When I was six years old we had this rabbit. Kept bobbing backwards and forwards over this fence, until one day it didn't make it over quite right. And it broke its neck. I caught up to my dad and we had it put down. He noticed I wasn't really upset about it and asked me. I didn't really have the words to tell him how I felt. That's when he kinda knew I think. Then, a few years later he took me hunting and we had this like, near my house. He didn't tell my mum obviously, said we went bowling instead or something. He asked me if I could kill a deer with a bow and so I did. That's not normal for a thirteen year old. He asked me if I had urges and if I can control them. I didn't really know what he meant at the time, but we carried on as normal. And then when I was fifteen, somebody broke into our house, a junkie, held my gun at gunpoint, was screaming at him, telling him to get him some cash or jewelery or something to sell. I snuck in and I could see the look of fear in my dad's face. My dad spotted me and he nodded as though he knew what I thinking. So, I tiptoed into the kitchen, got a knife, called out to my dad. That junkie came in after me. I hid behind the door, jumped the junkie, stabbed him until he dropped the gun. Then I slit his throat. - Shit! Kittens. - You saved your dad's life. I did indeed. - What happened to the junkie? - We buried him. So now, he doesn't come up in conversation much. We moved around a lot anyway. My dad, he's a medic in the marines, my mum's a staff sergeant. My parents, they taught me everything I know. - So how did you end up here? - A missing person's case was getting a lot of attention and I had some intimate knowledge as to how that person went missing, if you know what I mean. He was a pedophile. - Oh, so you... - Yeah. - So. So, I wanted to tour Europe. I'm not really a people person so I was wandering aimless for a bit. I think I found my purpose in life, as grim as it may sound. - Like an avenging angel. - Something like that. Got caught stealing, which was stupid. But that's how I met Maria Gomez so may be it was meant to happen. You wanna head back? I think the booze has probably worn off by now. - Yeah, cool. - Okay. Let's go. - Okay. Oh, ouch, fuck. - Shit. Are you okay? - Fuck! Fuck, I'm bleeding all over. - Okay, let's go. - Is it all stuck in there? Yeah, stay still. Maybe drinking's not my thing. - That's just the drugs talking. And were you not on so many of them, this will hurt a lot more. Deep breath. Wow! Oh my god. - You may lose the leg. It's already gangrenous. Fuck you. Did your dad teach you that? - Yep. You ask a lot of questions, Jess. - Sorry. I've had a very strange day. - Alright, that should be good. I'm gonna go and check something out. I won't be long. - What now? - The darkness is going to help. - Ooh, you're not... - Just a little reconnaissance. - Rest up soldier. The less you know the better. - Ignorance is bliss. - Exactly. - Eve, will you marry me? - I'll think about it. Should be easy enough. But not right now. I got some of your clothes from your room. - Ah, thanks. - I'll take you to the doctors for your foot. Come on. I'm planning on world domination. - Or to sleep all afternoon. - Probably the second one. Have you got the address? - Affirmative. - Is that my printout? - No, it's my printout. Oh, you are sneaky. - I wouldn't wanna end up at the wrong place and jump into the wrong pool, would I? Here, take this. Get a cab when you're done and I'll meet you after. - What are you going to do? - I have one more errand to run for my friend Maria. - Oh right. Well, in that case. - Yep, I'll get food, booze, DVDs and bacon. Yes, bacon. Then we can drive to the beach and... - We can do all those things. Hoppy. Now go. - Okay. - Adios. Bye. - Miss you already. Bye. - Turn around. - Please. I didn't know. I thought JP might be cheating on me, so I waited until he left to sneak in, to see if I could find some dirt. If you let me go, we can pretend none of this happened. He told me he loved me. - Can't do that. Now that you've seen this. You're gonna make us some good money. American internet snuff. - Oh. You're making snuff films. I get it. Shouldn't they be blue and from Belgium though? - What? You know, those little blue guys, that live in mushroom houses. It's easy to pull the trigger. Fuck! Okay. This could go one of two ways for you. Man, I need some different shit to say. Where are they? - Fuck you. - Only three bullets? What the fuck. Did you forget to pack 'em before you went off this morning or something? Let's see. Okay, that wasn't even a thousand revs. What? Okay, sat nav, now we're getting somewhere. - Favorite. - I'm sorry, what? Favor? - Favorite. Oh, okay. Favorites, why didn't you say so? Alright, so, go to favorites, press that, press go. Oh, could you move out of the way? Just a little bit. Little bit more. That's good. Alright, bye. Hello. Hello. Help. Help. Sssh, it'll do you no good. - Come on, come on. Please. Get off. No, don't you fucking touch me. Get the fuck away from me now. No. No. No. - What's happening? - I think I have some idea. Bitcoin? - Please, I'll give you all of it. - All of what? The cash. Everything I've earned from this. - How many people? - I don't know. I've lost count. - Jess? - Sorry. She's still moving, have a look. - "Sorry"? - Look, please, I just did this to cover myself. - What's your password? Tell me and I won't kill you. - You promise? - I promise. Juan Perro. - Now let's see if you're lying. Wow, you have been busy, haven't you? It's all yours. - Thanks. Chloe? Are you headed to the beach, Jess? - I'm in so much pain, Eve. Please. - Are you sure? - Please. Please. - She's gone? - Come on. Eve. - I remember.
