UM, IS THIS YOUR FIRST TIME? NO. ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN HERE ONCE BEFORE. I LIKE IT. I JUST DON'T THINK I COULD LIVE HERE. EVERYTHING'S SO SPREAD OUT. IT USED TO BE IN L.A., EVERYTHING WAS 20 MINUTES AWAY. NOW IT'S 24-HOURS- A-DAY TRAFFIC. MUST BE REALLY HARD TO MEET PEOPLE. PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THEIR NEIGHBORS ARE. WELL, HOW DID YOU AND RACHEL BECOME ROOMMATES? ARE YOU SCHOOL FRIENDS? UH, NO. WE MET AT WORK. YEAH. CARLA STARTED WITH THE COMPANY 3 WEEKS BEFORE I DID. SHE ACTUALLY OWNS THE HOUSE THAT WE LIVE IN.

WELL, I THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING SO WELL. I AM. WELL, YOU DID REGISTER FOR THE SPRING SEMESTER, RIGHT? DAD, YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING BACK. HONEY, YOU'RE TAKING TIME OFF, AND THAT'S OK.

RONALD. WHAT? CAN WE TALK ABOUT IT LATER? SO, RONALD, DID YOU WATCH THE NEWS LAST NIGHT? ALL 3 STATIONS LED WITH THE PAINT THING. I HAVE STRICT ORDERS FROM MY WIFE NOT TO TALK ABOUT WORK. HE DESERVES IT. THANK YOU, MONICA. SO, MICHAEL, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE WHOLE EBONICS THING? I LIKE YOU. I MEAN, WHY DID THEY THROW PAINT ON HIS NICE SUIT? DIDN'T RHODES GROW UP AROUND HERE? SURE HE DID. HIS FATHER USED TO OWN A STORE AROUND THE CORNER FROM US. YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE ABOUT HIM? HE SAYS WHAT HE THINKS, AND HE DOESN'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY ELSE SAYS. OH, COME ON, DAD. I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN FAIRFAX, AND NOW, I'M AFRAID TO COME HOME. IT WAS NEVER LIKE THAT BEFORE. HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN WAS PLAYING ON PEOPLE'S FEARS. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK SOMEONE SHOULD SPEAK UP FOR THE ORDINARY PEOPLE. I MEAN, THERE'S A LIMIT TO HOW MANY FOREIGNERS THIS COUNTRY CAN ACCOMMODATE. UM-- DON'T. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE ABOUT HIM? HE'S AN HONEST MAN. HE'S NOT LIKE EVERY OTHER POLITICIAN. THEY'RE ALL EXACTLY THE SAME. SOME ARE JUST A LITTLE MORE DANGEROUS THAN OTHERS. NOW, IF WE DON'T HAVE SOME STRONG LEADERSHIP IN THIS STATE, IT'S GONNA COLLAPSE ON ITSELF. YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME MAD? THE GRAFFITI. IT MAKES EVERYTHING LOOK SO UGLY. I JUST-- DAD, DON'T YOU THINK HE'S A LITTLE EXTREME? WELL, HE SHOULD DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO STOP WHAT'S GOING ON. I MEAN, THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE ON WELFARE NOW. THERE'S DRUGS, THE GANGS, COME ON! IT'S GOT TO BE STOPPED. BUT HE'S A RACIST, ANTI-GAY BIGOT. I DIDN'T EVEN ASK JIMMY WHAT HE WAS EATING TODAY. I WONDER IF THE CAFETERIA WOULD BE OPEN? THANK YOU, SWEETIE. SO, JIMMY, WHAT'S YOUR FAMILY DO? THEY OWN A VIDEO STORE. OH. HAVE THEY MET GINA YET? I'M GONNA MEET THEM AT CHRISTMAS. I REMEMBER WHEN I MET YOUR MOTHER'S FAMILY. REMEMBER, GRANDMA? I WAS SO AFRAID OF GRANDPA THAT I COULDN'T EAT, AND LIZZY, SHE FIXED ME A LITTLE CARE PACKAGE TO TAKE HOME SO I WOULDN'T GO TO BED WITHOUT EATING. REMEMBER THAT? MM-HMM. IF GRANDPA WERE ALIVE... LIZZY, LOOK. THAT'S OVER NOW, ALL RIGHT? I MADE A BIG MISTAKE. THAT'S ALL. YOU'RE GLAD I'VE COME, RIGHT? JAVIER, IT WAS ANTHONY WHO INVITED YOU, NOT I. HE DID IT FOR US.

ANTHONY, WOULD YOU GO IN AND GET SOME MORE WINE AND ALSO A GLASS FOR DANIEL? THANK YOU. THIS IS MY SON ANTHONY. HEY. HOW YOU DOING, MAN? AND THIS IS MY DAUGHTER GINA. HI, GINA. AND THIS IS MY DAUGHTER'S BOYFRIEND JIMMY. AND I'M JAVIER, HER HUSBAND. WHO ARE YOU? I'M A TEACHER AT ELIZABETH'S SCHOOL. MICHAEL. HMM? PLEASE DO NOT PUSH YOUR FATHER'S BUTTONS TODAY. NO POLITICS, ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT. SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW, MICHAEL? I'M WORKING AS A TEACHER'S AIDE IN INGLEWOOD, SAVING UP TO GO TO HOWARD. ISN'T THAT ALL THE WAY IN D.C.? YEP. YOU THINK HOWARD'S GONNA ACCEPT SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T FINISH WHAT THEY START? WHY DO YOU WANT TO GO CLEAR ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO ISOLATE YOURSELF AT AN ALL-BLACK SCHOOL, ANYWAY? WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SO CRITICAL OF ANYTHING BLACK? YOU'RE WORKING FOR A MAN WHO SOLD OUT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. HE IS SAYING THE SAME THING THAT I AM SAYING. DO FOR YOURSELF. DON'T EXPECT ANYBODY ELSE TO DO IT FOR YOU. OH, COME ON, DAD. THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT. IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHO YOU KNOW AND WHERE YOU COME FROM. SEE, WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE IS ACCESS. BUT YOU DON'T THINK YOUR MOTHER AND I WORKED FOR ALL THIS? I'LL TELL YOU THIS. IF IT WASN'T FOR "AFFIRMATIVE ACTION," YOU WOULDN'T HAVE YOUR BOY COLIN POWELL NOW, NOW WOULD YOU? MICHAEL, WHAT MR. RHODES IS SAYING HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BEING A BLACK OR WHITE OR DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. IT HAS TO DO WITH TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR OWN ACTION. LIKE THE WAY YOU WALKED OUT ON MOM? MONICA. WELL, IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT? MONICA, PLEASE. THIS IS NOT THE TIME OR THE PLACE. HOW COULD YOU BE SUCH A HYPOCRITE, DAD? MICHAEL, DON'T TALK TO YOUR FATHER LIKE THAT. NO, NO, NO, NO. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. HE'S JUST GOT NO RESPECT ANYMORE. WHY DON'T YOU TELL EVERYBODY WHAT YOU DID YESTERDAY, MICHAEL? HMM? IF I WASN'T THERE, YOU'D BE IN JAIL RIGHT NOW. MICHAEL. WHAT DID HE DO? OH, HE WAS THE ONE THAT THREW THE PAINT ON GOVERNOR RHODES. ALL RIGHT! MONICA, FOR GOD'S SAKE, PLEASE! MICHAEL, THAT'S NOT RIGHT, HONEY. YOUR DADDY WORKS SO HARD FOR ALL OF YOU ALL. YEAH? WELL, ASK HIM WHY HE'S ALWAYS WORKING. MICHAEL, THAT IS ENOUGH. YEAH. ASK HIM WHO LISA IS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? EXCUSE ME. MOM, I'M SORRY. YOU HAPPY NOW? MOM, I AM SO SORRY. IT'S TIME FOR DESSERT. I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. I'M SORRY. SOMEBODY, PLEASE TELL ME. MOM FOUND OUT THAT DAD HAD BEEN SEEING A WOMAN AT WORK. OH, I KNEW YOU WERE KEEPING SOMETHING FROM ME, HONEY. IT'S OVER. I JUST--OH, MY LORD, HONEY. YOU CAN'T GET A DIVORCE. THE AFFAIR IS OVER. YEAH, RIGHT. RON! BOY! MOM, YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY WITH HIM. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? WHY YOU ACTING LIKE THIS? YOU'RE ACTING SO WEAK. WEAK? TRYING TO HOLD THIS FAMILY TOGETHER IS WEAK? SOMETIMES I THINK IT'S NEVER THE FUCKING SHIT I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH, BUT YOU AND KRISTEN MEAN MORE TO ME THAN THAT. TELL ME HOW I'M WEAK. SHAME ON YOU! YOU'RE LEAVING. I'M SORRY, SWEETIE. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY, MOM. JUST GONNA EAT? MRS. WILLIAMS. RONALD WILLIAMS, HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE THIS, SON? MAMA, GOD KNOWS HOW SORRY I AM FOR BETRAYING THEM. SORRY IS ONE THING. HOW YOU PLANNING ON FIXING IT? I DON'T KNOW. I'VE BEEN TRYING. I KNOW I'VE HURT THEM VERY BADLY. I MEAN, MICHAEL'S ALREADY GIVEN UP ON ME, AND I'M SCARED AUDREY'S GONNA GO NEXT. THINK ABOUT WHY SHE'S STILL HERE. GIVE HER THAT MUCH RESPECT. WELL, I MUST SAY, HANNAH AND JESSICA ARE ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. THANK YOU. WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE COMING? WELL, WE HAVE OUR HANDS FULL TILL THESE TWO ARE 18, AND THEN, IT DOESN'T EVEN STOP THERE WITH DAUGHTERS, DOES IT, DAD? YEAH. PASS ME A TOOTHPICK, WILL YOU, ARTIE?

BEA, PLEASE STOP PESTERING HER, PLEASE. RACHEL, HONEY, YOU LOOK A LOT SLIMMER THIS YEAR. IS THERE SOMEONE NEW IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU'RE KEEPING FROM US? NOPE. NOBODY NEW. WELL, MAYBE IT WOULD HELP IF YOU CHANGED YOUR HAIRSTYLE. I GOT A LITTLE TURKEY HERE. I GOT A LITTLE TURKEY. WILL YOU STOP INTERRUPTING ME SO I CAN GIVE YOUR DAUGHTER SOME WONDERFUL ADVICE? YOU'VE BEEN WEARING IT THIS WAY FOR YEARS, AND IT LOOKS LOVELY, BUT I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT, MAYBE A LITTLE MORE GLAMOROUS. I REALLY LIKE IT LIKE THIS. YOU DO? OH. OH, BEA. SOME MORE WINE? SURE. WHY NOT? JUST KEEP POURING. HERE. TAKE THE BOTTLE. THANKS. THAT SHOULD BE IN THE CENTER, AND THE FRUIT-- VERY GOOD. DON'T WANT TO COUNT NO CALORIES. MOM, YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOU INVITED SOMEONE. WELL, I DID, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OF IT. WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE-- IT'S OK. I'LL LEAVE. OBVIOUSLY, I'M IN THE WAY HERE. IF THIS IS TOO HARD, I DON'T MIND-- NO, NO, NO, NO. DANIEL, PLEASE. JAVIER, ANTHONY WANTS YOU HERE. EVERYONE WANTS YOU HERE. PLEASE STAY. JIMMY, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE FOR DESSERT?

STOP! STOP IT, ALL RIGHT? GARY, I WAS ONLY TRYING TO HELP. WHY'D YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM? I TOLD YOU IT WASN'T MINE! IF YOU DON'T SAY ANYTHING, WE CAN'T HELP YOU! ARE YOU IN A GANG, GARY? NO! I'M NOT THAT STUPID, ALL RIGHT? WHY DO YOU HAVE A GUN IN OUR HOUSE? IS IT DON'S? WH-WHY DOES DON HAVE A GUN? SOME GUYS JUMPED HIM AND TOOK HIS JACKET. HE STARTED CUSSING HIM OUT, AND NOW THEY'RE AFTER HIM. WHAT THE--WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? HUH? HE'S MY BEST FRIEND! DAD, I GOTTA BACK HIM UP. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL A TEACHER? 'CAUSE TEACHERS CAN'T DO SHIT! THEY CAN'T PROTECT US AFTER SCHOOL. WE DON'T WANT TO READ ABOUT YOU IN THE NEWSPAPERS, HUH? WE CAME HERE TO GET AWAY FROM GUNS, AND YOU PLAY WITH THEM LIKE TOYS. GRANDPA, THIS IS NOT VIETNAM, ALL RIGHT? YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE OUTSIDE. I'M AFRAID TO GO TO SCHOOL. I DON'T WANT TO DIE. I DON'T--I DON'T WANT TO BE SCARED ALL THE TIME. WHAT?

YEAH, YEAH, I'M COMING. HOLD ON, KID. HOLD ON. JUST A SECOND. I WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYONE'S ALL RIGHT. HEY, YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT HAPPENED? WHERE DID IT COME FROM? IT SOUNDED LIKE A CAR BACKFIRING. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS. I THOUGHT IT WAS A CAR. IT'S DEFINITELY A SHOT. LOOK AT THE WINDOW. THEY JUST MOVED INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. YO. COME HERE AND HELP ME. YOU STAY IN THERE, JOSE, RIGHT NOW!
