(door rattling) Is this illegal? - I don't know. - If it isn't, it should be. - Come on, where's your spirit? - It's as dead as the tree we're gonna cut down. - What's your problem? You've been moaning and groaning all afternoon. - For starters, I hate summer, I'm hot, I'm miserable. I could be at home reading a book, but I'm stuck out here looking for a tree for someone who can't even leave the house and do it herself. - Nancy, that's not fair. - Fair, you know nothing about fair. You weren't raised with her. Listen, can we just drop it? (placid music continues) (feet thumping) And this is a dumb idea to have Christmas in July. - Well, Heidi said that you guys didn't have much of one this year. - Yeah, I kinda liked it that way. (birds chirping) She won't sleep with you, you know? - What? - If that's why you're being so nice to her, it won't work. - That is not my intention. All right, all right, I admit I like her, but that's not what I'm after. (placid music continues) What in this world could have happened to you to make you so angry about everything? - Nothing in particular. - I feel sorry for you. - Don't. - Look, Nancy, why did you even come out here? All you've done recently is give me the impression you hate me. - I guess I needed to get out of the house. (leaves rustling) - So what do you think of this one? - It looks like every other piece of wood out here.

I guess I don't know. I've always had it my whole life, ever since I was a kid, I couldn't even go outside then. I wouldn't go to Mom and Dad's funeral. I mean, I guess it could be worse. I see people on TV and I think, thank God I'm not them. - What about Nancy? - She resents taking care of me. - Come on, I wanna show you something. Here we are. - It's a tree. - [Terry] Yeah. - [Heidi] Why? - You guys said that you didn't have much of a Christmas this year, so I thought we could have one now. - What a sweet idea. - Thanks. Nancy, I actually asked her to go and get the lights. - Made me is more like it. - [Heidi] Thank you. - Yeah, I thought we could all decorate it, you know, together. - Well, you kids have fun, but I'm going to my room.

(eerie music continues) - Hey, jackass, you get it figured out yet? - No Sam, not yet. - Ash, I swear, your van's a piece of shit. - Yeah, well, at least I have a piece of shit. - We're gonna be late for the concert.

(couch rustling) (feet thumping) (knobs squeaking) (couch rustling) - Thanks. - Now you're actually thanking me? - Don't let it go to your head. (aircon droning) So how did I end up in Dad's office last night? - I don't know. You were having nightmares. - Oh, did Steph call? - [Heidi] No, why? - We're just supposed to finalize plans for the party. - Oh. - What? - Nothing, I just don't like you hanging out Steph, she's... - Here we fucking go again, you're not Mom, she's dead. I don't even care what you think, it's not even up to you. They're my friends, deal with it. - Just wait a minute. - No, you wait a minute. I can leave this house whenever I want to. Just because you're stuck here doesn't mean that I am. Can't I at least have a little fun? - Yeah, sure, I guess so. - Thanks. (feet thumping) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hey, there, it's me, Heidi. - Oh, hi. - Listen, I'm looking for a favor. - All right, sure, what? - Can you come over tonight? I need someone to talk to. - Listen, I'm sorry about last night. - Well, that's okay, can you come over after work? - Sure. - Okay, I'll see you then. - All right, bye. - Bye. (phone beeping) (placid music) - [Terry] So what's it like having ago... - Agoraphobia? I guess I don't know. I've always had it my whole life, ever since I was a kid, I couldn't even go outside then. (placid music continues) (door slamming) - Hi, I'm Emily, your new babysitter. - [Heidi] Hello, where's Nancy? - She's outside playing. So why do you like it so much in your parents' bedroom? Does it make you feel safe? (placid music) You've never been outside? - [Heidi] No. - You don't know what it's like? - [Heidi] No. - Do you ever dream about the outside? - [Heidi] Sometimes. (placid music continues) (placid music) - Do you wanna hear a scary story? Something that happened to me when I was a kid? - [Heidi] Sure. - [Emily] When I was just a little girl, something very strange happened to me. It sort of made me who I am today. I was at this family reunion, you know, the kind where relatives you never knew you even had show up. (placid music) It was in the state park with all these beautiful woods around. I ended up getting bored really fast, as little kids do. There didn't seem to be anyone my age there, (laughs) you know? My parents were preoccupied with cooking and hobnobbing, and I began to explore. (cicadas chirping) (feet thumping) At first, it was really, really fun. I felt like a pioneer trekking into uncharted areas all by myself without an adult. I watched in fascination as a cool summer breeze blew through the tall trees, which I imagined had been there hundreds of years. I came upon a stream and drank right from, even though my parents had told me never to do that, that all the water was polluted. It tasted so good and so fresh. (water splashing) There were little fish in there, I even splashed some of the water on my face. At first, I was following a trail, and it got more and more overgrown, so I turned back. There were birds tweeting all around. They were so pretty. (birds chirping) I was still taking it all in it. (feet thumping) It wasn't long before I realized I must have taken a fork somewhere because time was marching on. I could tell by my parched throat and sweat coming down off my forehead. I couldn't believe it, I was lost. I had been raised never to wander off alone, and here I had gone and done what I was told not to. I stifled back tears, trying to find my way, but the trees now seemed ominous and unfriendly, like they wanted to hinder my path or something. (eerie music) I came to a clearing, and there was an old cemetery in the middle of nowhere. As I walked along the tombstones, looking at the names, I started to think about death awaited there, more than I had ever before, how our bodies ended up buried in the ground. I thought about heaven and hell, wondering where souls went and exactly how you got to one or the other. Then I started to panic, thinking I'd never seen my parents again. Thinking about death and all, I really started to freak. What if I was lost forever? What if I never saw my mom and dad again? I freaked in the graveyard, running past tombstone after tombstone. In my mind, I could hear the dead laughing at me from below the earth, chuckling at my frenzy, beckoning me to give up and join them. (eerie music continues) I finally made my way out of the cemetery and back into the woods. Overhead through the trees, I could see the sun beginning to set. I don't know how I got so lost, sure that my family had to be looking for me, right? Darkness descended, and it was scarier than anything I'd ever experienced. My heart pounded like a jackhammer. There were sounds in the woods I had never heard before. And when the moon came out, illuminating everything in the shadows, I just knew I'd never see my parents again. The feeling of isolation and pending doom I had were overwhelming. If the trees were hostile before, they were downright mean now. Creatures crackled and growled and I ran through the trees. (eerie music continues) It was then that I saw him, coming to a dead stop in a clearing. He was hooded and dark, and I knew he was Death. It had to be the Grim Reaper, who I learned about in school. I'd figured I must've made somebody mad at the cemetery and Death had my number. I ran and I ran and I ran through trees, through brambles, my clothes getting ripped to shreds, scratches tearing me to pieces. I knew I'd never seen my parents again. And I was so afraid of being buried in the earth. Everywhere I ran, I caught a glimpse of Death, behind trees, crouching in the bushes. He jumped out at me everywhere I went. He was the woods because he was made out of moonlight. Finally, I came out of the woods and found myself standing in front of this huge, sprawling mansion with giant pillars out in front. It was spookier than anything I had ever seen. It looked almost like a morgue, but I approached it anyway. It was better than Death in the woods. It turned out it was an old plantation home, and a nice old lady named Gretta owned it. She let me use her phone and I was reunited with my parents. - I didn't go to Mom and Dad's funeral. (placid music) (vehicles exploding) (placid music continues) - [Terry] What about Nancy? - She resents taking care of me. (Nancy screaming) - Do you wanna hear another scary story? Something about monsters this time? - [Heidi] Sure. - Do you believe in monster? - [Heidi] No. (placid music continues) (couch rustling) (Heidi groaning) (feet thumping) (eerie music) (Terry knocking) (feet thumping) (door rattling) Hi, come on in. - Thanks. (feet thumping) So what's the problem? - Well, Nancy and I got in a fight. She's supposed to be going to this party tonight, but I don't even like the people that she's partying with. - Mm, she thinks you're mothering her again. - I guess so. Anyway, I was kinda hoping you'd stay and keep me company while she's gone. - Sure, sure, of course, you know I will. - Thanks. (feet scraping) - (sighs) You're here again? - Nice to see you too. (vehicle droning) (vehicle honking) - [Nancy] That's Steph. - [Heidi] When are you coming back? - Soon enough. (door rattling) (door slamming) (vehicle droning) (door rattling) Hey. - How's it going? (door slamming) (gravel crunching) - So what do you wanna do? - Mm, I got a new video game in the mail today. Do you wanna try it? - All right, but you know I'm not very good at 'em. - Eh, try. (vehicle droning) - What's wrong? - I don't know. - You know, you shouldn't worry about your sister, she'll be fine. - I'm not worried about her. - Well, then what's wrong? - I said, I don't know. - God, lighten up. (board creaking) (game beeping) (Terry sighing) (controller thumping) - See, I told you I suck at this. (upbeat music) (eerie music) - Oh, great. - That's not good. - We blew a fuse. This happens all the time. - [Terry] Where are you going? - To get a flashlight. (feet thumping) (eerie music) (drawer rattling) Oh, sorry. The fusebox is out in the shed, past the barn. - Okay, that's kind of odd. - It's an old house. My grandparents wired it. Would you mind going out and flipping the fuse? - Oh, I don't know, maybe we could just tell some scary stories in the dark. (eerie music continues) - [Heidi] I'm not exactly fond of the dark. - Oh, okay. - Have fun. (feet thumping) (eerie music continues) (door thumping) (feet thumping) (wood thumping) (feet thumping) (tense music) (eerie music) (feet thumping) (feet thumping) (eerie music) (Gorganium growling) (tense music) (vehicle droning) - Shit. - What? - I left my wallet at home. - I can cover you. - No, I need to go home and get it. - I said, I can cover you. - Please take me back. - Fine, God. (eerie music continues) (Gorganium growling) (gravel crunching) (keys rattling) (boot rattling) (tape ripping) (gun loading) (eerie music continues) (grass rustling) (gun rattling) (eerie music continues) - Terry? (door rattling) Terry, Terry? (tense music) (Gorganium growling) (gun shooting) (fingers tapping) (vehicle droning) (gravel crunching) (doors rattling) (doors slamming) (feet thumping) - Why is the door open? - [Heidi] Oh, thank God you came home. - I forgot my wallet, where's Terry? - [Heidi] Will you do me a favor? - When do I not? - The fuse flipped and Terry went out to the barn to turn it on and... - He probably electrocuted himself. - Yeah, but he's been gone almost 15 minutes. Will you go out and check on him, please? - Don't look at me, I'm gonna go wait in the car. - Please. - Fine. - Thank you. (flashlight clicking) (feet thumping) (gravel crunching) - You wanna come with me? - Nope. - Gee, thanks. (feet thumping) (gravel crunching) (door rattling) (door slamming) (eerie music) Terry, Terry, Terry? (drum thumping) If you're trying to scare me, I'll kill you. (eerie music continues) - (yells) Oh my God, oh my God, oh shit. (window squeaking) (vehicle droning) (vehicle honking) (tense music) - Steph, I'm coming. - Hello, Officer Higgins? Yes, this is Heidi Everson. (eerie music) Listen, there's something weird going on out here. (chains rattling) (eerie music) Well, I suppose it could be a bunch of pranks. But I don't think so. Sure, I'll call you back if anything else happens. (phone beeping) Bastard. (tense music) - Terry? (eerie music) (Nancy grunting) - Nancy, it's me. - What the hell are you doing? - There's something in here. - A cougar? - No, it's something I've never seen before. - What are you talking about? - It attacked me and ran away. (Gorganium growling) (grunts) Nancy, get your sister and get out. (tense music) (grass rustling) (gun shooting) (eerie music) Go (screams). (tense music) (siren ringing) (vehicle droning) (Terry screaming) (Gorganium growling) (door rattling) (door slamming) - Nancy. - Terry's dead. - What? - Terry is dead. - What are talking about? - There's something out there. - Out where? - I don't know. - It's okay, you're safe in here. - You don't believe me, do you? - Listen, some strange things have been going on, but I don't know, maybe you saw a raccoon. - I know what a raccoon looks like. - I'm sure there's some explanation. - Terry is dead in our barn. - What do you want me to do? Call the police? (feet thumping) It's not working. (feet thumping) (tense music) Where are you going? - I'm gonna get Dad's gun. (door rattling) (Nancy and Heidi screaming) (Gorganium growling) Now do you believe me? (door rattling) - Can that thing get through there? - I don't know. (feet thumping) (door rattling) - Where are we going? - Heidi, we have to get out of here now. It's time to get over your phobia. - No. - Heidi, I'm serious. This is life or death. - I can't. - Out. - No, no. (hand slapping) (gasps) Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Nancy, Nancy. (tense music) (door slamming) (feet thumping) (Gorganium growling) (tense music continues) (door rattling) Nancy, it's out, it's out. (window slamming) (feet thumping) (door rattling) (tense music) (Heidi gasping) (eerie music) (Nancy yelling) (tense music) (door rattling) (Heidi screaming) (Gorganium growling) (tense music) (Gorganium growling) (placid music) (Gorganium growling) (Heidi gasping) (veins slurping) (door rattling) (feet thumping) - Heidi. (eyes beaming) No. (Nancy thumping) (veins slurping) (siren ringing) (placid music continues) - We are done here. - Wait, you owe me an explanation, please. - What you saw was a Gorganium. It is from... Where it is not from is your planet. (placid music) - Sir, should we be telling her this? (placid music continues) - Six of your months ago, a fail wrath escaped our custody, seeking refuge on this planet. Fail wrathes are large, cumbersome and not particularly intelligent. Therefore, it wasn't too difficult to track down and eliminate. Unknown to us at the time, the fail wrath was hosting a parasite, the Gorganium. Gorganium are small, quick and prone to hibernate in colder climates. We were forced to wait. - [Nancy] Wait for what? - Wait for it to feed. (placid music continues) - Wait, will she be okay? - She will be fine. She will remember nothing. You not have that luxury. We cannot do anything about that, nor can we do anything about the human lives already lost. (placid music continues) You will of course say nothing about this, to your earth authorities in particular. Remember, we know where you live. (eyes beaming) (placid music continues) (light whooshing) (placid music continues) - Good morning. - Oh, I slept on the couch again. - Yeah. - You're sure in a good mood this morning. - I'm okay, how are you? - I'm pretty good. Terry and I must've partied pretty hard last night. I don't remember him leaving. (couch squeaking) - What are you doing? - [Heidi] I feel so good, I think I'm gonna go for a walk. - You're gonna what? (door rattling) - I'm gonna go for a walk. (feet thumping) (placid music) (eerie music) - Sir, we have a situation. - [MIB 1] What? - The Gorganium has replicated. - [MIB 1] That's impossible. (energetic music) - It has.
