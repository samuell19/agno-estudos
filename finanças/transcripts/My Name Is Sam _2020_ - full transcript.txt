Samuel, why are you talking about this nonsense? - At school, they showed pictures of the earth, and it's round. So how could I fall off if it's round? - Samuel, it's not round. - The moon is round. - Samuel, enough! The school and the devil are trying to brainwash you. - They are?

Well, I really enjoy having Samuel in my class. He's doing well with his grades. And he's well behaved. Well, he certainly is an imaginative boy. So, I would like to mention a few things that I've noticed. I've noticed some behaviors in Samuel that at first were of no concern. But now, they're proving disruptive to my class. - What is he doing? - Well, for example, Samuel waves goodbye to his learning utensils at the end of every day. When the bell rings, instead of getting in line, he sits on the floor and waves goodbye to all his items. I have to tell him to get in line. - Really? - Have you two noticed any odd behaviors at home? - No. He's well behaved. - Well, if Samuel's acting out in school, there must be a reason. - I think the problem might be his peers. - Well, a lot of these kids are just plain cruel. Did you know Samuel and his sisters are being bullied? - I can completely un-- - Maybe the teachers should do their jobs, and not allow the bullying to happen. - I can control what happens in my classroom, but I can't monitor what happens outside my classroom. Unusual behavior isn't new at any school, and neither is bullying. I believe that special attention given to boys like Samuel can be very helpful. - How? - It often helps people like Samuel to be able to speak with someone who understands what they're going through. - Are you suggesting a doctor? - A doctor is a good place to start. - We only go to doctors when someone is hurt. - Well, there's lots of doctors in the world, and they're not all for physical injuries. - Oh, I don't know about this right now. - Jake, please we have to consider helping Samuel. - The school needs to crack down on bullies. That is the problem. - I cannot crack down on bullying like you may believe. - Then what about the parents? Who is going after them? - We try to speak to the parents of bullies when an incident's reported. But oftentimes, that backfires, and there's an increase in bullying. - Well, something needs to be done. - I do have an idea. I have a colleague in the child psychiatry business. I'd be happy to ask her if she's willing to see Samuel for free. ♪ music playing - You need to behave yourself. No disruptions. Let's go home. - Chris. - Jake. - Good to see you.

And well, I've been a little short this month. - Jake, I wish you had spoken to me of this earlier. I would be happy to provide you with some assistance, courtesy of the church. - No, John, that is not necessary. As part of our extended church family, it is our responsibility to ensure that we do everything in the name of solidarity for our community. - Well, I appreciate that, John. - And as you know, it is also appreciated if you give some of your time to the church. I know you say you've been busy, and these social activities are costly. These activities are forbidden by the church. - John, I assure you, there has been no forbidden behavior going on. - I hope not. You have a great responsibility to God and to our community. - Bishop, I assure you, there is no need for concern. - Jake, let me state my position. Then we can move on. If I hear of one more indiscretion, one more incident of your betrayal to our community, let me make myself clear. The drinking, the parties, the irreverence, this cannot happen again. The church can be forgiving. But even the church has its limits. - Yes, John, I know all about limits. - To be perfectly clear, Jake, a family that is shunned by the church is scorned forever. That is my duty to you, to God, and our community. - Understood. - Well, Sarah, there you are. I was wondering why you were not at bible study today. - I brought back your jars, Maggie. Thank you for lending them. - Is everything all right? - Samuel is acting out. - Listen, Sarah, I think God is testing you. I know raising children is not easy. My own parents struggled with it. Actually, Jake rebelled the most. Boy, did my brother love music. His friends wanted him to join a band. But our parents wouldn't have it. - Oh, no, it's not like that. There is something truly wrong with Samuel. Maggie, please do not repeat this. - You have my word. - Samuel has been acting strange at home and at school. And the other night, he made a sculpture. Jake and I were very concerned. And we-- - Does the school or the church know about this sculpture? - Oh, no. Maggie, Samuel needs to see a special doctor. - No. Sarah, no. You are looking for help in the wrong place. Your faith should be in God. He made our brains the way they are. These people don't know how brains work. - We at least want to see what they say. - Sarah, please listen to me. Don't disregard the traditions that have kept us together for so many years. If you disregard your vows and go off on your own accord, you know what that means. - Maggie, I-- - Sarah, you know what that means! - I don't know what to do. - Yes, you do, Sarah. - I am so confused.

Plus, you know our children cannot go past the eighth grade. - I just think we should-- - Sarah, please! You are well on your way to more trouble. - What do you mean? - You will be excommunicated, from your church, from your house, from your family, Sarah. Samuel is acting out because you are not living like you should. You and Jake are living like English people. You have to stop. - But we have. - It is no secret that my brother is often tempted by worldly things, like the appliances in your house. You have not gotten rid of them, have you? Sarah, you and Jake must fully commit yourselves to God, and rid yourself of all of those things that pull you away from him. I am afraid for your children's souls. I will say no more.

I want to put them on the table. - Absolutely not.
