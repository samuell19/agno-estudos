Back in those days I had been suffering from hemorrhoids. One day the pain was so bad I left work early. That's when I first met him. Hey you! What're ya lookin' at?! What, am I botherin' ya? Hey. Hey hey. Hmph! Hey girl! Hey! I said hey! Don'tcha know yer supposed to give yer seat up to the elderly?! Hey! I'm talkin' to you! Oh shit you're old! My bad my bad. Been drinkin' ya see. Yer head just looks so shiny 'n purple y'know. Creep!! Off she goes! Sit down, pops! Sit! Sit down, pops. Sit. No, you can have it. I said sit down!! Now! Ah, okay… That's better. Laala Laala~ Laalaalaala~ Anyone need this rag? "The next stop will be Ofuna. Ofuna." Let's switch seats. Nah nah, I'm good here. Where you headin' pops? Chigasaki. I see. Well, at least have a drink with me. Ah, no, I'm good. Don't gotta put up a show for me, pops. Here, down the hatch. No, really. Hey!! You tellin' me my booze ain't good enuff for ya?! No, that's not it. It's just… I have hemorrhoids. What? Hemorrhoids?! That's bad news! What're ya laughin' at?! Hemorrhoids, huh… Yeah, can't be drinkin' then. My pops used to have 'em real bad. Could hear 'im cryin' out in pain at night. His were outties. "Anal prolapse." Ya got outties, pops? Bleeders? Prolapse. I see, prolapse! Those hurt like hell, huh? Make even a grown ass man clench his cheeks 'n scream! Hey! Bastards! You think what I'm sayin' is funny?! Ain't you ever hear a man talk about hemorrhoids before?! Happens to the best of us! Bastards! Please, sir. You're disturbing the other passengers. Come with me. Alright already. I'll sit down. Do you know this man? No… Not really… Okay off you go. Fine. I'm goin'. Gimme a hand, will ya. See ya, pops. Take care of your ass, okay? I felt like I had avoided getting hit by a speeding train yet at the same time I was sad to part with this strange man so soon. (Pops!) Until next time! Of course, never in my wildest dreams did I think we'd meet again. Dept. of Welfare - Board of Health - Disease Control - Assistant Manager - Welfare Officer This is my full job title. Sir, the attendance list for Yoshikawa's farewell party. So everyone marked down with an X has a prior engagement, right? Oda has to attend a debate, and Saito is away on a business trip. What about the director? I'm going to ask him now. Okay, do that first, then. Ol' mitey seems sad… It's 'cause him and tapeworm are close. I wonder if the director'll come? Oh sure. If it's a party for anyone higher than the asst. manager, the director is there. Half past six? I dunno… You, when is my meeting with the undersecretary? Not until eight, but you have another meeting at seven… That's right. Well, guess I can make an appearance. Director, you have to get going. Ah, I see. I hope you gentlemen will excuse me but I have an appointment I must get to. Ah, no, thank you for taking some time out of your busy schedule. It truly comes as a blow to our department losing a veteran employee as fine as Yoshikawa. But considering this request came in from Fukuoka and the job of national hospital manager is a perfect match for him it was the ideal chance to display his talents. (So I would very much like for him to settle down, and focus on his new position.) Also, it is known that Hakata in Fukuoka is known for its beautiful woman. But lucky Yoshikawa here will be taking his family along with him. So Mrs. Yoshikawa won't have to worry about him. Anyway, I'd like for you all to help guide the young new prospect coming over from head office. Yes, we will be trading Yoshikawa here in for a younger model! Yoshikawa, I wish you the best. Thank you, sir. Ah no, please don't get up. So Hakata's got a lotta beauties, huh? So I'm basically transferrin' to babe capitol? Right? Anyway, let's drink. Ah, no… I'm-- Ow! Got hemorrhoids. Hey… You tellin' me… Yer ass is too precious for me?! Hey now! Look, this is my last sake in Tokyo. Yer ass can spare a drink or two with me. Don't leave me hangin' mitey. Alright already! Hey, mitey. What is it, tapeworm? Come visit me in Kyushu once in a while, huh? I'll probably be there until I die. I'm not cut out to be an administrative officer or whatever… Let's have a drink… To the both of us… and those of us who are about to die. All alone. Back on the train home from sending Yoshikawa off my head was spinning from all the sake. Of course no buses were running at that hour. I didn't have the energy to run, so I resolved myself to wait 30 minutes until my turn for a taxi came. Which is where I met that man again. Hey!! Ya buncha-- Why ya gettin' in one by one like a buncha ministers?! Ya gonna visit a dead aunt or something?! Just freakin' go for it! Thems taxis is big enough to fit five or six of ya! Safety first my ass! Whaddayou lookin' at?! Hey! Lost yer voice?! Me I'm headin' to Enoshima. Well? Buncha mutes here!! You shitfaced? Huh?! Ah! Pops! Whether we headed straight home from the station or whether we stopped somewhere and drink some more I can't say I quite remember. All I know is for the first time since long I got drunk as a skunk. What's the damage?! It's fine, I'll get this one! Keep the change, ya filthy animal! Heeey!! Mooom!! Daddy's home! (Mooom!) (Mooom!) (Heeere's daddy!) (Mooom! Open uuup!) Hey mama! Mama!! I brought a guest! Ah, I'm so sorry if he's caused you trouble. Please, come in. Get it together, papa. Papa ain't drunk! C'mon, cowboy. Who you callin' a cowboy? Say my name, dammit! You have a name?! How many times I gotta tell ya, goddammit! It's Gengoro Ban! Gengoro?! What are ya, an insect?! [Gengoro means diving beetle] The hell you talkin' about?! Who are YOU callin' a bug?! Ya four-eyed walking stick!! Don't matter if ya look like a beetle or a bug from a human point of view the two of us is the same! No shit sherlock! Mama, fill us up will ya? The doctor told you you should quit drinking! Zip it! Yer loud. Hey! Remember your hemorrhoids. Best thing for 'roids is a bath. Yeah, a bath. Mom, go fill a bath will ya? Ah, yes. Alright. It's settled. Bath time for the big boy. C'mon, take yer clothes off. Please, don't do that in here. Let's go the bathroom, okay? Oh me oh my. Oh my goddd! Even in hot water, a flower grows~ Call 110. [Japanese 911] This is too much. But what if he goes nuts and kills dad? Good point. (You gotta wash yourself first. Don't you even know how to take a bath?) (Ow ow ow! Mama! It's too hot!) (Mama!!!) Well add some cold water! To Sado, to Sado, the plants are swaaaying toooo~ Is life good in Sado? La la laaaaaa~ Is life good theeeere~ Hakata's where all the pretty girls are, huh? Hah. Am I nothing but a no good vagrant~ Ahh, I just don't have that type of anger in my gut. Look, if yer not havin' fun ya quit. And if they're givin' ya shit whether it's the boss man or yer folks, ya just… knock em down!! Easy for you to say. It's-- It's a nationwide problem. The way us Japanese always brush our own needs off. Everyone's afraid to go with the flow. Look, papa. (If a guy's bustin' yer chops ya just gotta set em straight.) When ya lose yer heart they'll just walk all over ya. Hey. Did you lose your heart to me? Yeah, I like ya! If yer heart's made up ya give it yer aaaaall~ A maaaan's heaaart~ A flaming desire, a longinggg~ Oh god… Oh man… *whimper* (Papa!) You done yet? Hurry up! Ewwww! Did you check the shoe rack? I did but nothing was taken. At least everyone's safe. Worst that happened is he forget his bag. Gross! Hey! Watch where you're throwin' things! Mama, I'm good with just tea and some umeboshi. Owowowow… Fu-chan, can you ring the pharmacy for some Cresol? What for? I'm not going in that bath before it's been disinfected. Ew, gross! What do you plan on doing with his bag? I'll have him come pick it up. Don't even joke about that. coming over again… Well it can't be helpaaagggh-! How can I give it back to him if I don't know where he is?! Think before you speak, sheesh. Don't you be acting all high and mighty! His hemorrhoids are back. Him and tapeworm were out late last night. Tapeworm does bring out that kinda behavior. Ah- not again. Here you go. Don't worry, we didn't look inside. This is all I own. I'm so sorry about last night, ma'am. That's okay. Please tell your husband hi for me. Well, I better go… Please, don't worry about it. Really. Ma'am!! There's a peddler heading this way! Can I use your phone? Oh my, here too?! He's not a peddler! What's this about a peddler? Ah, they pop up from time to time. But don't worry about it. Where do you live? Next door. But I don't-- Leave it to me. This way, right? Bastard. (Hey you-!) Fuckin' idjit! Bumpkin! Get lost, kid. What's your problem? I just got outta jail yesterday. So what? You wanna end up in the hospital next? What's that supposed to mean? Git!! Stop dawdling and GIT!! Scum!! You're so strong~! Like in the movies! Alright, that's that. I'll be going now. Where are you going? South I believe. Izu? Further down. Kyushu? Further. Where's that? Amami Oshima. Oh my! Livin's easier down South when it gets cold. I go where the wind takes me. Okay, I'm off. Tell your husband hi. Okay. Until we meet again! You too, miss. Thank you so much for helping us out! Any time! Who is that man? Dunno. Sonuva!! When my wife told me about this I felt very sad that I wasn't around. Thinking we would never meet again I couldn't help but remember him with a deep sense of nostalgia. However, two months later… One Fall evening… Disappearing in the evening sun~ A single sparkling silver star~ If yer heart's made up ya give it yer aaaaall~ A man's heaaaart~ Papa! It's him! Hey! I'm back, boss! I see the fam's in good health, too! What have you been up to? Down South? Oh yeah! Check this out! So I went to this breakwater construction site on the island, yeah? But the bastard contractor there had cut so many corners and then this typhoon came… Swept that eight-part breakwater clean off the map! All the island folk were in tears… Oh yeah, how's yer 'roids? Ah, thanks for asking… I got some good meds for those! Viper sperm! Whether it's 'roids or I dunno what one hit of this and a skinny dude like yerself is back in business! It also works for you-know-what. Don't take too much, tho! You'll get a nosebleed! And for the little miss, I got some snakeskin. Check this out for size… Here! And for the missus… Oh me, oh my… Looks so expensive! You shouldn't have. Oh yeah, the little man! Oh man, I plum forget about ya… This won't do… My bad, kid. I'll bring ya something good next time, 'kay? Ya want like, I dunno, a big ass live snake or somethin'? I hate snakes! Okay, how about like a giraffe or an elephant? I like dogs. Dogs? That's easy! Okay kid, yer gettin' a dog next time. Alright guys, gotta scoot. You're leaving already? Well, it's late and I don't wanna overstay my welcome, so… Have a beer with me! No no, I can't. We'll see each other again soon. Sober. You sure are keeping busy! Where are you going? Just North of here. Hokkaido? No no, across the station. They're buildin' a water treatment plant there now. Like a 30 minute walk from here? Anyway, I'm off. Sorry for barging in! The pure love of a man, the color of the star of love~ A 30 minute walk, huh? Fu-chan! We already saw him again the next Sunday. So I got a buddy at the clinic, right? What was it he did again? Y'know, those people who catch and put down stray dogs? Dog killers? Uh, yeah, in a nutshell. Anyway that's where I found this guy. Is this alright? No worries. They were gonna put him down anyway! Is this good for food? Ah, perfect! Eat up, Poochie! Ohh, his name's Poochie? Dunno, he's a pooch so I call 'im Poochie. Eat, Poochie. Maybe he's not hungry? And what do have we here? What a beautiful dog. Ooo, a Boxer! Where'd he come from? Uhm well… He brought him here. Ah! It's you! How have you beeeen? Ah, good, you? So you brought him, huh? I see-- Hey kid, he can't eat this! What then? Starchy foods aren't good for dogs, ma'am! Cow bones, soft-boiled eggs, milk… Dogs like this require a specific diet! You should go to the store and get some proper dog food. Dog food, huh? You gotta be kidding, lady! This dog can't be eating Western food… It's pointless! Don't mind them, kid. He'll eat it. How about the two of us build a dog house, huh? And done! Say you're pretty good at this! Heh. You know who to call if you wanna expand your bathroom! There's nothing a carpenter can do that I can't! Ah, speaking of which… Could you maybe fix the door to our kitchen? Mama, please. Well I'm done waiting for you to do it! This carpenter sure cut a lotta corners! You see these kinda rush jobs a lot with amateurs. Aha! Got it. What is it? This board's rotting! Gonna have to redo this in the next 1-2 years. Otherwise yer house is gonna tip over! Excuse me, but… The antenna of our TV doesn't work very well… Could you maybe have a look-see? How about now, ma'am? (Yes, that's good! The picture's crystal clear now!) Cables rot easily on account of all the salt in the soil this close to the sea. Really? You think we ought to replace that one, then? On it! Thanks so much! Not only did he fix the leak in my roof, he also repaired my storm shutter! I'll bring some tools to fix your tub next time. Thank you! We've made you work so hard today! No worries. If ya need anything fixin' I'm yer guy! Oh my, you're so reliable! No wonder with those big burly arms of his! Can I feel em? Hey, stop foolin' around! You think your husband can get ripped doing that? He's like a fish out of water! (Papa.) You're just gonna get hemorrhoids again doing that. Ah, let me! Where do you want it? The other side. Over here, then? Hey, careful! What if it breaks?! I paid a lot of money for that! The stone? Yeah, cost me ¥1,000! [USD9] One thousand yen?! That daikon pickling stone? He wanted a bigger one but it was too pricey. Don't you know the Sagami River is packed with rocks like that! Packed you say? Yeah! You wanna get one? One, or two or three? Big ones like this? Bigger! So like this? Real bigguns! Papa, don't be rude! Don't underestimate how heavy those rocks are! Don't worry, I can handle one or two measly rocks! Uncle, the dog just won't eat. Huh? He ain't? Oh he probably doesn't have enough space to exercise! Let's take him for a walk at the beach! C'mon, let's go! Gen-san, please have some tea with us? (C'mon Poochie, let's go.) I never know what that man is thinking. Right? This time it's a dog, next time maybe he comes home with a lion?! Maybe I'll tell him to bring home a quiet, pretty young woman next time? How rude!! Papa!! Come quick! There's a girl! A girl? What girl? Miss!! Hey! Stay with me here!! Answer me! Hey! What happened? She tried to drown herself in the ocean! T-t-that's terrible! That's… Um-- Mama. Look, um, what's that… The warm thing? Yeah, that! Fusako! Make yourself useful! I'll heat up the bath! Do I look like I need a bath?! (It's not for you!) Mama! Mama! Umm, get a stethoscope. A stethoscope, a syringe, and some bitter orange juice! Shouldn't we call a doctor? I can't wait around for that, let's bring her upstairs. Oh yeah, um, phone the police! Get out of the way! What are you doing?! Careful with her! Are you okay? (How is she?) Her pulse is steady. Miss. (Miss.) You didn't take any sleeping pills, did you? Can you answer me this? (Did you take anything?) I figured. Okay, good. Miss! Your pop's a doctor? He works for the government, but he does have a doctor's license. A government guy with a doctor's license? Damn. He works in disease control. Disease control? So he's not an importer exporter? What? No. Like for example when Cholera starts spreading. His dept. is in charge of vaccinations and disinfecting places. Oh, like that white powder they scatter around toilets? I dunno about that… I see. A government official with a doctor's license who works in disease control… Hachoom!! You should go and change out of those wet clothes! Nah I'm fine! Hachoom!! Thirty minutes later a police officer came around. As there are a lot of people who try to drown themselves in the sea he didn't seem at all surprised. I was walking the dog with Gaku along the East coast… [he misreads Manabu's name] when I saw a young girl. Realizing she was trying to drown herself, I hurried to her rescue. That right? Yeah. Did I do something wrong? How close were you to the girl when you discovered her? Um, let's see… 300 meters! 300 meters? I dunno, maybe 400? 400 it is. Wait, 450…? Sigh… 450. Maybe 500 is more accurate… Could you even tell from that distance whether it was a girl or a boy? Probably not. I just saw someone trying to commit suicide. But earlier you specifically said you saw a young girl, no? Ah, right. Yeah, I did. Well, make up your mind already! Sorry to interrupt, but I think Gen-san merely assumed it was a girl. "Ah, there's someone there… And they're about to drown themselves!" "If they're trying to drown themselves it must be a girl!" Is how I believe he suggested it to himself. Yes, exactly. Please be quiet, you! Now, which is it gonna be?! I'm sorry, sir. I'm kinda blanking here so I dunno. Please forgive me. No sooner than the policeman had left, as if she was lying in wait the woman from next door came over. So there I was, starin' off into the ocean. And I see there, standing in the water, a young girl. "This is bad news, she's trying to kill herself!" I says to myself. What did you do? Figured calling out to her would be pointless, right? Say he's the girl, okay? So I come up behind her, like this. Thing is she didn't even try to fight me off or get away! She just stood there in a daze. So I grab her collar and I slapped her face a couple times. "Hey! Wake up!!" "Your parents gave you this precious body!" "You're still young!" "You have so much to live for!" "Okay? So quit tryin' to kill yerself!" "How're you gonna live life to the fullest if you give up now?!" Whoa… You sure say some real stuff! Where are all these details coming from all of a sudden? Sorry, I kinda blanked in front of that cop. What happened to the girl? Didn't say a word. She just started crying. So I pick her up like this and rush her over to land. I dunno how far I ran, or how cold the water was… I don't even remember how heavy she was. All I remember is how sad she looked. No matter what I wanted to help her. Save her life. As I was thinking this my heart became so heavy. At that moment… I thought that perhaps, I too, would die here. I truly felt I might. The police don't intend to pursue this. They said if you want we can pretend this didn't happen. Good, right? Okay. Well, it's up to you. Ah, as for reaching out to your family… Let's see. Kagoshima prefecture, Satsunan County, Tokara Island, Yoshitsugu Kazami. That's your father-in-law, right? You wanna let him know? I guess not. If you'd rather not I won't make you. Well, think it over when you're back on your feet. You're free to stay as long as you want. I'm sorry. Looks like her parents aren't her biological parents. She won't give me any details, though. I just don't know if she'll even be welcome if we send her back home. Besides Tokara is kind of a desolate place, nothing there… I saw it once from a plane. Didn't seem like a lot of people lived there. Papa, how much longer do you plan to put her up here? As long as it takes. Sigh-- The world's a scary place. They can't all be blessed with a loving family like our Fusako. I understand if maybe my family wasn't pleased but I felt good about the decision to let the girl stay with us. How old are you? 21. Oh? You ever think about dying? Huh? No way! Would you look at that. Old mitey's actually cracking jokes? Maybe he's about to get promoted? No way. This is this place! Put 'er down! (I told ya to be careful! C'mon!) (Wait wait wait!) (Dammit! Quit yer bellyachin'!) (And don't be knockin' inta anything!) (And a-one, and a-two!) *thunk* Thanks fellas! Take five! Ma'am! Ma'am! You home?! Ah well, c'mon in for a sec. You sure? Don't worry, these folks is like family to me. Ma'am! Ma'am?! Ma'am? Ma'am? Lock the door if ya leave, sheesh. You! Um… Yer that girl! Wait… Who did ya think I was? I'm not sure. I-it's me! You know, in the water, I held you like this. Oh right. I'm sorry for not realizing. Thank you so much for saving me. Don't worry about it! I'm just glad to see ya out and about! So yer alright, yeah? I see… That's great! Gen-san, this the girl? The one ya picked up in the sea? Idiots!!! Who do you think you are, goin' into someone's home like it ain't no thing?! Git! Okay, tell the misses I said hi will ya? Ah, your hat… Ah! Thanks! I'm sure she'll be home soon… That's okay, we're pretty busy. Got a car waiting for us out front, too… Get outta here will ya?! Well, see ya soon, okay? Bye! Aiko seemed so out of it when I got home, I wonder what happened? She was so out of it when Gen saved her she probably doesn't remember his face. But to be that shaken up? Gen-san is pretty intense if you've never met him before! I can't imagine owing my life to a guy like that. She told him she thanked him, though. It's scary no matter who you are! So it'd be fine if he looked like Alain Delon? Apples and pears! It's cause he was wearing sunglasses and a helmet on his head! Where's he supposed to wear a helmet, his foot? I found myself looking forward to seeing how Gen showed up the next Sunday. Baron, go! Sit! I'll make sure to come visit again with my parents some time. Apologies. Ah, no, really, I'm so embarrassed about this whole thing… No worries. You don't know how grateful I am for returning him. Truly I thank you. Our pleasure, really. Well, I'm off then. Drive safely! Baron, sit! See you! Do you know where Mr. Date lives? The big house in the pine forest, right? I can't imagine a good kid like that is still single… Who knows. Uncle! Kid, where's Poochie goin'?! You're not gonna believe this, Papa! W'happened? He's here, dad! Who is? Doc! Did Poochie's owner show up or somethin'?! Uh, well, yeah. I was the one who told you about the dog getting put down, remember?! Yes, we told them as much. They were extremely thankful. Hold on… What's going on here, Gen-san? You're looking like a real fancy lad today. Oh, this? I just got this the other day but I dunno if it really fits. Look at all this stuff! Huh, you serious? Wh… What's going on? Who died? Oh wait, is this for Aiko? Hey, Aiko! (Yes?) Your lifeguard is here! Ah, uh, well I gotta be… You just got here, didn't you? Ah, I don't wanna put you out-- What're you talking about? Ah, there she is. Hello. I'm sorry if I was rude to you the other day. Ah, no. (Hey, look at what he brought you.) Thank you. Gen-san! Oh my, take a look at you-! Aren't we looking handsome today! Ah, no, that's, I-- My clothes are being washed, so I had nothing to wear… Not even a single loincloth! So I borrowed these from a friend… Look at me now, huh? Haha hah. Fusako took Aiko, who was still down in the dumps and reluctant to leave the house out for a walk to try and get her mind on other things. Lucky for them Gen-san had tagged along, looking like something of a bodyguard. Yo pops, get outta da way! Dumbass! Got one for each arm, huh?! This guy's rakin' em in! Leave some for the rest of us will ya?! Ya dirty dog! W'happened?! Ah maaan, can you freakin' believe this?! Did it overheat? Yeowch! Bastards! Whut da-?! Waugh!! Fuggin' idiot!! Ya slack-jawed yokel!! Gen-san, how often do you get into fights like that? Happens like once or twice a year. Gen, were you always this strong? Look kid, that weren't no fight. When I fight, it's life or death ya hear? Whoa. Hey! What's his problem?! Gen-san, it's fine. Is it? Thanks again for this morning. Ah, same here. You out on a stroll? Yes. I would like to introduce you to my father. Okay. I thought I recognized him. That's Poochie's owner, right? Aiko? Mr. Date invited me for a drive. I'm sorry, Gen-san, could you look after Aiko for me? Ah yeah dun worry about it! Treat her well, and get her home on time, okay? Manabu, come. I wanna stay with Gen-san. No Manabu, you're coming with me. Okay, we're going! We don't need them to have fun, right? Ya want another drink? Western food ain't bad, huh? You want some tonkatsu? Ya gotta tell me what ya want, okay? Whatcha lookin' at? It's funny when you think about it. I'm a fisherman's daughter. I can swim around in the sea for hours on end… …of course I wasn't gonna die in the sea. Ya probably forgot on account of your mind goin' blank, right? That's what happens to me when my mind goes blank. Can't remember anything! Well, don't worry about it. Papa, would you look at all this?! Such a polite young man! What business are the Dates in? They run a pharmacy. Seems they go way back with your office, Papa. A doctor's son! His car is so cool! Got yer sights set on a son-in-law, ma'am?! Gimme a break, I just met the guy today. Believe me, I can tell when a guy's smitten! Really! I can't with this guy. Please don't joke around! This is a very delicate matter. You really think he's in love with Fusako? No doubt about it. I wasn't trying to be funny! But how can you tell? It's in the eyes. Eyes? The eyes don't lie. What did his eyes say? Ya can't put it into words, it's a feeling. Oh you! I'm serious!! Then how did he look at her? Like I said, it's hard to put into words. I deserve to know as her mother! Right, Papa? Hmmm, knowing just by his eyes… Believe me, I know these things! Then please, explain! I'm tellin' ya, you cannot put it into words! Then show us! This is no laughin' matter, ma'am! How serious all of a sudden! Gen-san, please. You're not letting this go, huh? Let's see… Don't laugh!! Aiko was laughing. For the first time she'd opened her heart to us. That evening, Gen-san invited me out for drinks. So I told 'er! I says ya gotta show gratitude to Mr. Saotome and his fam I says! Then what? So she said she understood. Talkin' about how nice everyone's been to her 'n all. But that she feels guilty and wants to get a job. She said all that? Yeah so I says to her I say… Don't worry about all that, just try and help Mrs. Saotome around the house 'n stuff. Ya won't be able to help 'em money-wise but I told her it's not like the Saotomes are hurtin' for money, y'know? You didn't have to tell her all that! Oh? But I gotta say, pops, ya don't 'zactly look well off, y'know? Hey now, you makin' a fool outta me?! But y'know… She really thinks highly of ya, Ai-chan does… Oh? "He's such a good person," "So kind, and friendly." "Mrs. Saotome is so lucky!" Fer real pops, no joke! Another drink? Mama-san, sake! (Yes!) I got ya covered tonight, doc! Don't be stupid, I invited YOU! Lemme buy you drinks today, man!! Nope! This sake ain't worth much, but whatever! Drink! Yeah okay I'm drinkin'! Mama-san! Bill's on me, okay?! The sake we shared was delicious. Whenever I drank with him my heart was drunk with happiness. [humming "Otoko no Junjou"] (Sir!) I brought your umbrella! Thanks! Mama tell ya to do this? Yes. She said you forgot to bring it. Arigato arigato! Ah, watch out! Ai-chan, you have fun today? Yes. I see. Good! Gen-san's not that bad a guy, huh? No sir. Not all men are bad, y'know. Gotta keep yer chin up! You're right. Most important thing is… …how all our souls are connected! Stuff might happen make ya wanna die… But it's the same for all of us. Even me! But death is boring! Once yer dead… that's it! Right, Ai-chan? Yes. I truly think you're right, sir. (Alrighty.) Ah! Watch out! That night I had drank a bit too much. And because of that I suffered from severe hemorrhoids the following days. Hello. Thanks for the other day. Is the misses home? No, she's out shopping. She'll probably be back soon. What's up? Ah, nothing. Well, I was just in the neighborhood so I thought I'd pop in for a smoke? Sure! Ah, no, I'm good. Taking a break from work? Ah, no. They say you don't need a blade to kill a farmer, just let it rain for three days. Hope this lets off soon, tho… It really is coming down, huh? You holdin' up okay?! Ah, no, I mean… If there's something ya gotta do around the house, but you can't tell Mrs. Saotome? Ah, no. Anyone around givin' ya guff? Huh? I mean if there's any hoodlums givin' ya trouble, lemme know okay? I'll whoop their asses! Just give the word! Well, just know that I'm here for ya, 'kay? I'm usually at the water treatment plant they're building across the station. Just ask for Gengoro Ban from the Ishi group. Here, take this. If you wanna go get somethin' to eat, okay? Well, I'm off! Wait! When I came home late that night Aiko told me about what had happened. Well, just take it and leave it at that. I'm not saying you have to use it if you don't want to but you can accept it, right? Yes. Alright. I'll do that, then. Good night. Don't worry about it too much. Okay. I dunno… She might've gotten the wrong idea. Doesn't that man think before he acts? Don't you think he's being weird? Idiot. You still don't get it, do you? Get what? It's a confession of love. Huh? He's not like kids these days. He doesn't wear trendy clothes, and he doesn't know how to talk to women. What are you on about? Do you really not see what is going on? The man is putting his heart on the line! It's just his way of showing he wants to protect the woman he loves. Protect her with his own two arms. It's his instinct as a man. Is it though? It is! Knights in the middle ages would throw their lives on the line to protect their lovers! That's exactly the way Gen-san is. You could never understand. I feel for you. Well I'm sorry. It's not like I've ever had a real man like that court me. The next Sunday, I was invited to the beach by Gen-san. The problem lies with the fact she's been hurt before. By a man. I dunno what exactly happened but to a pure-hearted woman like her those wounds will never fully heal. There's no quick fix for that kinda thing. Right. It's her fear of men that made her this way. You're fighting an uphill battle, my friend. A young woman's heart is a complicated thing. No foolin'. I had my fair share of girl trouble when I was young. I shouldn't have given her that thousand Yen bill. You really shouldn't have. I'm a fool. If you'd at least given her some chocolate or taken her to a movie, she would've been happy. A movie, huh? The key to Ai-chan's heart is not a thousand Yen bill, Gen-san. What then? It's love. Warm, enveloping love. I see… If it's her heart you want, you gotta get your act together. Chin up, Gen-san! Doc, hold this. You okay? Yah!! Aaaaah hahahaha! Here, catch! Let's do this! You can't do it, doc! Here I coooome! You won't make it, stop! Ah man, you splashed all over me! Thinking back on it, that was the last Sunday I was able to hang out with him. He didn't show up to our house for a while after that. And some trouble regarding vaccinations had cropped up at a certain health clinic so I was extremely busy. As usual the blame was being laid with the government. I spent my days growing more and more fed up with it all. Hello, Saotome here. Hey! It's you! Huh? No, no. How are you? When are we seeing you again? (Actually…) (I don't have any plans tonight.) Oh? You wanna grab a drink? (No, actually… Ai-chan…) What about Ai-chan? (I was thinking about asking her out to a movie.) (Do you mind?) Ohhh, I see how it is. I'm sure she'd love that. (Oh yeah? Alright!) Yup. (I was worried what to do if you'd said no!) (Y'know, this is the first time I ever called the government!) If it's you Ai-chan is with I won't have to worry. Take good care of her! (Don't you worry about that!) Have fun! (Okay, thanks doc!) Picturing his expression as we talked on the phone put a smile on my face. Mama, what kind of movie are they going to? Something with Noon in the title. With Alain Delon. I see. Muta dac cento e di pensiero~ ["La donna è mobile," from Rigoletto] Tan tan, 'n tan tan~ What's up with him? La donna e mobile~ Lan lan lan la la laaa~ I amused myself picturing Gen-san patiently watching the movie and escorting Ai-chan home like a gentleman. I found myself wanting to help them be together. Just picturing their wedding ceremony was a scene that gave me much joy. Duuun duuun dudu dudu dun dunnnn~ Welcome h-… What happened?! Ai-chan! Go and check on her! Paaah paah pa pa pa pa~ What's up? It's Aiko. Huh? She came home looking like she got assaulted. What the--?! Hey! Is Aiko alright?! I just saw her outside, her hair all messy, wearing only one shoe-- We don't ourselves yet! I bet it was a pervert! I saw one giving me looks at the post office before!! I dunno what to do! I keep asking her but she's not answering, and she doesn't have her handbag! Ai-chan! What's wrong?! Are you alright?! What happened?! Weren't you with Gen-san? Didn't he escort you home? Dammit! What the hell is going on?! Mama! Mama! Did you phone the police? No, not yet. Well, what are you waiting for? I think someone stole her handbag… Yes, we have to hurry! Same thing happened to me, but I waited too long to phone the cops and they never caught the guy! Wait! What? Come with me. What is it? Just… come. What is going on? I mean, Gen-san was with her, right? Yeah, but she just said he didn't escort her home… Really. Calm down. Don't you think, perhaps Gen-san… Perhaps… what? I mean… Maybe he… did something to Ai-chan? What?! So… She was with THAT guy?! Yeah, he took her to see a movie. I knew Ai-chan didn't really wanna go! But still he kept pushing her! But Papa told them to go, right?! This is bad, ma'am! That's just the kind of man he is! And what kind of man is that?! Do we have to draw you a picture? You shouldn't talk about things you do not understand!! He would never. Not ever! He's just uneducated and rough around the edges. But that doesn't he mean he'd ever… He wants to protect Ai-chan! If a pervert gave her trouble he'd beat his ass to a pulp! So don't even go there… You should have some more faith in people… Anyway, just contact the police. But-- Fine, I'll do it! You sure? I mean, what if-- Quiet! Ah, hello, am I speaking to the police? Ah, yes, this is Saotome from the East coast. No, Sa-o-to-me. Saotome. Written with the characters for quick, latter, and woman. Saotome. The thing is-- I felt uneasy as I was explaining. Despite how confidently I spoke in front of my family moments ago I couldn't help but wonder, what if he… It kept me up all night. Hello? Yes, that's right. You caught the guy? Yes. Yes! He turned himself in? I see! Yes, we'll be right over! Ah, actually, the girl took some painkillers last night so she's still asleep. But I'll… Yes, I'm her guardian. Yes. Thank you so much! They caught him! Turned himself in! Had her shoe and handbag, too. I knew it was some pervert! See, I told you! You guys just don't understand. Ah, ma'am! They caught him! The pervert from last night! Really? Oh, thank god! Smoke? Ah, thanks. I can't thank you enough. Seems like a lotta girls are being attacked in that area lately. You think maybe it was all this guy? Hard to say, really. You think he's yakuza? No, he's a construction worker. I see. You know the water treatment plant they're putting up across the station? That's where he was working. I see… Got a light? Umm… What was his name again? Kind of a funny name. Gengoro. Gengoro Ban. Umm… Are you sure about that? Why? Well, because I know this man well. I'm actually pretty close with him, so I dunno about what you're telling me here… You're acquaintances? Well, yes. Strange, he didn't mention you. T-that is strange… Actually, he's… He took the girl to see a movie yesterday evening. He even asked me for permission. That might be so, but he admitted to the crime. Huh? Oh… Right. I don't get it… Well, I'm sure it'll all become clear if I can talk to him. Do you mind keeping this on the down-low? Hey now, you're the one who's charging him! Yes, I realize that, but… Well, with a crime of this degree, not much is gonna come of it if there are no charges. Ah, I see… Yes, right. Could you please wait here? I'll go and talk to him and ask him-- Hey, wait! I'll be right back! I have to see him now! (I knew it was Gen-san. I knew as soon as it happened!) (Calm your tits!) This is no time to be gloating about being right. Ai-chan, you're gonna have to speak up here, okay? I'm sorry. Please stop apologizing. I understand why you didn't before but you have to talk now, 'kay? You're gonna have to explain this to the police, too, so… The two of you went to see a movie, right? Yes. Some Alain Delon movie or whatever, right? Yes. Hey you! Ow! What?! Okay, so where did you go afterwards? Gen-san wanted to grab a coffee at the station. But I said I didn't like coffee… So you went to Kagetsudo? [sweets shop in Akatsuka] No. I didn't wanna stay out too late and worry Mrs. Saotome. So you declined? Yes. Then what happened? He said he'd take me home, so… So he walked you home, right? Yes? It's been so long since I saw a movie, I couldn't stop crying. You remember at the end when Rene & Marie saw each other? Yeah, that was good, huh? I really had to bite my lip there. It's kinda embarrassing. That was enough to make ya cry? I wonder what it's like to be loved that much… Guess that only happens in the movies. But that's what's so great about them. Ai-chan. Yes? The stars sure are pretty, huh? On the island I was born there's way more stars. Bigger, too! Oh yeah? When my father would scold me and lock me out of the house I'd always look up at the stars and cry. You were a little troublemaker, huh? Not really. It's just… he's not my real dad. I guess I was just born under an unlucky star. So you left the island? Yeah. I thought maybe I could find a better life somewhere. But then… I… Why was I born like this? I've had nothing but bad luck. From a man's point of view how else would you have handled that situation? I don't know what I would have done in his shoes. But his ways were clumsy, and unfortunate. Ai-chan. No!! Aah!! No, wait! I don't-- I'm just-- You're getting the wrong idea! Please!! I didn't mean to--! I didn't… It was close to noon when he had calmed down and turned himself in. Does that man ever think before he acts? I'm the one who jumped the gun here… Don't you need to be at the office? It's fine, this'll be over soon anyway. Mr. and Mrs. Saotome? Ai-chan, I'm going to see Gen-san and tell him the charges are dropped, okay? So don't worry. This is the guy, right? Ah, yes. Hey, man. A fine mess this is, huh, Gen-san? You see, I'm the one who filed the charges… I'm so sorry. But… Ai-chan kept quiet, so you see… If I had known it was you I never… It's rather silly when you think about it, huh? Right, Gen-san? I get if you're mad at me. But why didn't you just explain what happened…? Well, water under the bridge. Right, Gen-san? Well, you got anything to say? I told you last night, I did it!! W-what are you talking about?! Nothing happened! Ai-chan is waiting outside. She wants to apologize to you! You still angry? Let's just get you out of here and we'll talk it over, okay? What's wrong? Talk to me! Ah hell, who cares?! I'm just a stupid, stupid man!! Hey, come now! Can I go, chief? Hey, Gen-san! Wait! I'm not who you think I am, you hear?! The two of us are through! Gen-san! Well, you two definitely know each other. He's really blowing this out of proportion! Anyway, I'd like to drop the charges. No worries, we'll take care of that. So you'll release him soon, yeah? We can go home together? It's not gonna be that simple, I'm afraid. Why not? Prior offences. Huh?! Sold some building materials on the black market over in Niigata. Also caused a guy bodily harm in Saitama. Well, I'm sure they knew each other but that doesn't change his record. So, he's… (Yeah, he's now in the hands of the prosecutor's office. Might take a few months.) That same afternoon, two police detectives came to the house. Asked us all about Gen-san. What a scary guy, though. Didn't you see on his arm? Tattoo marks! I caught a peak one time and he quickly covered his arm! I was so scared! You guys are too forgiving! He doesn't deserve your kindness. (Ai-chan, grab me some water.) (Yes.) Papa, don't overdo it. Shut up. Leave me alone. What are you pouting over anyway? It's all cuzza you guys! Makin' a big fuss over nothing, look what happens! What are you saying? You're the one who lost his cool! If you hadn't called the police we wouldn't be in this situation! Oh, drop it. It's like she said, we were just too naive. Yeah. No bad deed goes unpunished! What bad deed? He sold stuff on the black market and beat a guy up! What's that gotta do with us?! Doesn't change a man's worth! Ai-chan. What do you think? I'm sorry. This is all because of me. Another apology, huh? It's not enough. Why couldn't you just speak up yesterday?! I get that it was embarrassing, but still! If you'd just spoken up this never w-- Papa! Leave Ai-chan alone already! Shut up! Please calm down, sir! And you. What are YOU still doing here? What right do you have to butt in on our affairs? Papa, don't be rude! Yeah, just 'cause you're drunk you think you can say anything! You fool!!! Sir! Ai-chan, go to your room! (Papa, calm down!) I realized I was just venting my anger. Even though I knew, I couldn't stop myself. The next morning we went back to the police station but we weren't allowed to see him. Yes, Saotome. Hello? Anyone there? Ai? Ai-chan? Yes. I wanted to apologize for the trouble I caused everyone. What's this all of a sudden? What's going on? Anything wrong? I've been thinking. I can't have you always taking care of me. So after today… (Wait just a minute. Let's talk this over during dinner, okay?) No, I'm afraid I won't be able to leave. Which is why I'm going while you're at work. Leave? Where are you calling from? (Your house.) Then, uhh, where's mama? Put her on, will you? She's not home. I'm sorry if this seems selfish, but I have to go… (You can't do this!) (Who knows where you'll end up?!) I'll get by on my own… Somehow or other. I'll never ever forget your kindness. Thank you. (W-wait!) (You're being awfully rude, you know?!) Hey now, don't make me get mad here! Just… wait for me there! I'll be there right away. Ai-chan! You there?! Saotome. Saotome! I have to go. Are you surprised she left with the way you were acting yesterday? I'm the one who should be upset. Feel like I was stabbed in the back. Leaving us with nothing but that letter. And what's the deal with leaving us money? No, I don't approve of this at all. Besides, isn't that the money Gen-san gave her? That's dirty money. You listening? I tried looking for her but I couldn't find out where Aiko had gone. Naturally I didn't hear so much as a word from Gengoro, either. Ever since then, my hemorrhoids had started acting up again. I spent the cold and slightly salty Winter feeling as if I was a prisoner of my own heart. And so, without realizing it a year had passed. (Saotome, can I see you?) You can barely tell he's here these days. Think his time has come? Old mitey just ain't head office material. Have a seat, won't you? It's gotten pretty cold, huh? Yeah. How're you holding up? Huh? Ah, well, can't complain? You said your hemorrhoids were acting up, right? Ah, no… I cut back on alcohol, so I've been good. I see. I've had some trouble myself lately. I thought about having surgery, but I just can't find the time. Well, maybe if I stopped drinking myself… Easier said than done, though! Yeah. But I'm glad. Huh? What do you say? You wanna go to Hachinohe for a couple years? The quarantine station chief over there just quit. I was just thinking a pro like yourself would make the ideal successor. Can't you refuse? Not on my life. But it's not set in stone, right? It is if you're called in to the director's office. I thought the manager was acting kinda strange lately. I bet he knew. (Hello!) Welcome home! Papa, you're being transferred? Oh dear… Hachinohe isn't exactly close-by, is it? Well, I don't mind the countryside. I guess this is what happens when you work for the government or an office. And I thought we'd be able to settle down, when Papa began working at the head office three years ago… Please don't say that. When is he leaving? Early next month. Hey, Manabu. Hachinohe ain't bad, y'know? Lots of nature, lots of tasty fish. What are you talking about? I don't follow. Are we going, too? What, you're not planning to go with me? It's not that easy! Manabu just got in at Shonan, it's an important time for a young boy! And what about the house? Actually… Fusako and myself were talking about that on our way here. If… And only IF you were to be transferred and have to leave everyone behind… I was thinking perhaps you would let us live here? If Fusako and myself were to live here with mother, maybe she won't feel so lonely. It'd be a good place for Fusako to raise a child, too. Keep this between us, but my mom is kind of a pain. I could help Manabu with his studies, too! What do you say, mom? I do like the sound of that! Papa, what do you think? We'll find a nice place near the coast of Hachinohe and in the Summer vacation we'll come visit with Manabu and have fish together! Sounds good! Cleaning ladies over there are pretty cheap, right? Mama! You sure you want that for him? What if it's a pretty young girl? Oh I don't mind. You're saying that now. Dad ain't THAT old yet! Hah! I'd like to see him try! I dunno what I'd do if I was alone… Oh mom! What's wrong? Didn't you hear? I thought I heard Gen-san… You okay? I know I heard him just now. Singing… I worry about him… Maybe the stress finally got to him… For some reason I had been feeling like a criminal. So I ran away from my crime, to a small village up North in Tohoku in an attempt to wash away the guilt. It was the only way I could think of to stop beating myself up… And so, wishing you all the best-- No, I truly do. Tohoku is after all the birthplace of the most beautiful women! And as I hear Saotome is leaving his family behind so I'd be lying if I don't envy him a little but I truly do wish him nothing but the best! But maybe when it comes to women, maybe I don't wish him ALL the best. Maybe it was all the sake from the farewell party, but once again I found my hemorrhoids acting up. I had been regretting riding second class. When the conductor came over, I considered trading my ticket for a first class seat. (Is this seat taken?) No. Sir! Ai-chan! That baby? Did you get married? Yes. I see… W-would… (Hey! Mother! You find a seat?!) There's one over here, too! Oh!! Doc! That you?! It's me! Gengoro!! It's Gengoro, doc! Doc. Didn't see that comin', didya? Sorry. It just happened this way. Sorry, I told Aiko we oughta tell ya. Oh well… I'm kinda embarrassed. Don't worry, we were gonna visit 'n bring ya a gift… Man, of all places… Can't believe we just bump into ya like this! Right?! He kept saying how embarrassed he was about causing your family so much trouble! Please forgive us! (I don't know how to make up for not keeping in touch.) It's fine, I understand. You don't need to apologize. I'm glad. I'm just so glad. I don't know what to say… Alright, here's to us! How're yer 'roids, doc? Never mind that. Alright, here ya go! Ai-chan, congratulations. We got some catching up to do! Ours is a story so sad each 'n every one of us is gonna end up in tears! Translated by Carlo V
