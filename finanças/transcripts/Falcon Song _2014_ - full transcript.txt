This is the 173rd meeting since the dawn of our great organization. We are having a hay-bale drive starting next month. And the annual moose-calf census has been postponed. Now, up first... Is the issue that Paul has been having with bluebirds in his front yard. You say that some kids have been feeding them antacids? -Yeah. Makes them explode. -Have you actually seen one of these birds explode? -Well, no. But I've heard that their stomachs are too small to withstand the pressure from the fizz. -Anybody else have any research on this? Okay, then. -This is stuff is a waste of time. Just a few hundred miles from here, you got people trying to flush the old ways down the toilet. Hell, they're wiping out whole counties in the name of progress. Right here in black paw, you got people just waiting for the right moment to ... to change everything. -"Preserve and protect." Our fifth motto. -[ Sighs ] I've had several offers on my ranch recently. -From who, jabez? -Cap Davenport. -Heck, cap Davenport's buying up half the town. And for what? To ruin it all to hell. That's what. -Slim, lot of people in this town don't see it that way. -It's 'cause he's buying them all off. For cheap, too. And they're just letting him. They don't get it. -Well, ido. We've had some really hard times around here recently for a lot of folks. Guy comes along, offers to take the troubles off your hands, and you start thinking about it long and hard. -Jabez. You're not considering it, are you? -[ Chuckles ] Me? No. No, my family's lived and died in falcon ranch going on five generations now. Some of them even died fighting outsiders who had an eye for carving up the land, stripping it, not just of its value, but of its soul. -Welcome. -[ Laughs ] Oh, man. -Hey, dad. -Randall! Ha!

Mm! -Thank you, Phyllis. -Hey. I'll see you later... Or not. Probably not. -[ Muttering ] [ Sighs ] -Sydney! -Whew! -Don't you be a stranger. -Caught me, sir. [ Both chuckle ] The captain has caught me. How was, uh ... how was your, uh, grand party? -Oh, the party was the party. I mean, those things are always kind of fun. -[ Sighs ] -Next week, we'll take you down to the boat. I'm entertaining some, uh, out-of-town investors. -Yeah? -Yeah. Is, uh, Randy back yet? -No, he's out with his, uh ... his ... his lady. What do you think of her? -Nice girl. -I mean, I just met her. I don't ... how long has Randy known her for? -His whole life. She's a bit of a spitfire. I mean, she grew up on her ... her grandfather's ranch. -What about the scarecrows? Anything? -No, I put the sheriff on it. But when we do find that guy, he's gonna go down like a burning ship. [ Chuckles ] -[ Knocks on desk ] That's kind of cutthroat of you there, captain. -My great-grandfather was a notorious pirate, Finley Davenport. They used to call him "shark's fin" because of the way he used to sneak up on his victims. -He'd stalk his victims. -Yeah. Yeah, he used this very sword to fight off half an army. And then when they caught him, he kind of slipped right through their fingers, and we never heard from him again. [ Chuckles ] -Bravo! Good bloodline there, sir. -Finley's grandfather was the right-hand man to Jean lafitte. -Lafitte! Uh, lafitte! -Yes. Uh, uh, uh, battle of New Orleans, uh... [ Imitates explosion ] Yes. -Yes. [ Imitates explosion ] -[ Chuckling ] Yeah! -I'm overwhelmed by your vast intelligence. -Ah, thank you. [ Chuckles ] -But the most important thing was that it was rumored that his grandfather's father, Avery, ran off with the lost treasure of Jean lafitte. -[ Sighs ] Wow! [ Laughing ] [ Inhales sharply ] Treasure. -"Now and then, we had a hope "that if we lived and were good, god would permit US to be pirates." I always tried to get Randall to read this, but he never did. I think you would really enjoy it, Syd. -Yeah? Well... [ Sniffs ] All right. [ Chuckles ] -Just to let you know, it's not as if I didn't come away with somebooty. Would you like to see it? -[ Laughs ] Where be your treasure, captain cap?! You've got, like, a secret panel or ... -almost. A secret door. -Almost as good. -I don't show this to everyone. -[ Laughs ] -One...two... Three... -Oh, my god. -Mm, okay. -[ Exhales sharply ] -[ Sighs ] Granddad, you and your band of merry men are gonna get found out one of these days. I almost got caught last night cleaning up after you. -Nobody asked you to do it. -Paul dropped a feed-store receipt last time you boys pulled one of your pranks. You guys would all be in jail if it weren't for me. -Yeah, well... That cap fellow should be the one in jail. -Granddad, he's gonna be my father-in-law. -I don't need to be reminded of that...Twice. -We're all gonna be family, okay, granddad? Can't you just find a way to make peace with him? -Look, I'm not the one that's stirring everything up. [ Knock on door ] Can I help you? -Yeah, I'm here to talk to Sarah. -This is, uh ... it's one of Randy's friends. -Oh, don't want to get behind that. I'm Syd. Nice to meet you. Great place you got here. Uh, do you mind if I have a word with your granddaughter? -[ Sighs ] -Yeah, she's all yours. -Come on. -But imind. -Yeah, you don't have a choice. -[ Coughs ] -All right, what the hell are you up to? -I don't know what you're talking about. -That is just so cute, but you are trying to sabotage your fiancé's family business? -I didn't do anything. -Okay. So no big problem if he finds out, then. -[ Scoffs ] He would never believe you. -Yeah, but his dad might. -I know your type. Just floating through life with your head in the clouds. -You know, why don't I just give cap a call, tell him what you're up to? -What do you want? You want ... you want money? Is that it? 'Cause I can get you some. -Really? -Get you to Portland faster. -How much? -[ Sighs ] I don't have much...On hand, but I could get you a job here. -[ Chuckles ] This is exactly where I want to be. Thank you very much, yes. I would love to work here as your ranch hand. -And a place to stay. -I have a place to stay. And if you've seen it, I'm kind of digging it there. -It's a good offer. You should think about it. -You're real feisty, you know that? -[ Scoffs ] -No, I like that. [ Knock on door ] -You mind if I come in? -Matter if I do? -Come on, jabez. We're gonna be in-laws. -Well, I like Randy good enough. Takes after his mama. -Maybe you and me, we can get together on a wedding present for the kids. -What do you got in mind? -I thought I could take it off your hands, and I could let the kids live here forever. -[ Chuckling ] I swear to god. You're like a busted down, old record. -You're months behind on your payments. Now, the bank's been letting it go till now, but I happen to know that you're one month away from default. -I ain't about ready to lose my ranch. -How you gonna keep it? -Oh, I got ways. Now get off my property. -Come on. -Get off my property! -You and me both know that gun hasn't worked in probably 25 years. -Go! -Good luck, skipper. -Go. -She offered me a job at her grandpappy's ranch out there. -Really? -I mean, they need the work. I need the cash. It's ... well... -[ Laughs ] -What? -Oh, sorry, I just ... I can't see you working on a ranch. -You can't see me working at a ranch, getting my hands dirty? I can't do that, too? -Not to mention Sarah Lou. Man, I would not want to work for her. -Huh. Why are you marrying her? -Okay, you met her. -Yeah. -She's beautiful, right? -Yes. -Yes, well, she is also the most amazing girl I have ever known. -How well do you really know her, though? I mean, how well can you really know somebody? I'm not a big relationship guy. -I know her as well as two people could know each other. -How do you people do it, man? It's like a fairy tale out here. You love her. Your dad loves her. It's just perfect. -Well, thank you, but you do not have to worry about her. Okay? -Okay. I won't. -She's one of the good ones. -Yeah. -Yeah. -[ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] -I think once I break that little filly, she's gonna be a good barrel racer. [ Water runs ] I wanted to tell you I hired a hand to help US. -You what? -And he's just in town for a little while, and I thought he could give you a break. -Who said I needed a break? -You got to watch that blood pressure. You know what the doctor said. -No, we don't need extra help here now, Lou Lou. -We do. More than you think. [ Sighs ] Remember how I told you that I almost got caught cleaning up your mess with the scarecrows? He saw me, granddad ... Randy's friend. And if he tells Randy, or worse, cap... [Sighs] I don't even want to think about it. -Well, why hasn't he said anything before? -I don't know. But we need to stay on his good side so he doesn't go blabbing. -Well, let him blab. You did nothing wrong, and I'll ... I'll take the fall for you. It was just a little mischief. -That's not how cap sees it. He thinks someone's gunning for him. -That's not a bad idea. [ Laughs ] -Granddad, don't even joke about that, okay? Tell me that you're gonna stop. -Okay. I'll tell you that. -Did you just give me the double wink?! -[ Laughs ] -Granddad, this isn't funny, okay? I mean, you and your pals might not go to prison for what you're doing, but after all the fines and legal fees, we're gonna be all cleaned out. It's just for a couple weeks, okay? That's all. City boy won't be able to take much more than that. -[ Chuckles ] [ Door opens ] -I want you to take that job at the ranch. He says he's gonna hold on to it without my help. So I want you to find out how. -Okay, but, I mean, if the guy doesn't want to sell the ranch, the guy doesn't want to sell the ranch. -He can walk away with a nice, little profit, have some good comfort for his golden years. -Huh. Cheers to that. -Yeah. -Yeah, good on you. -Yeah. [ Exhales sharply ] You know, I'll tell you what. I'll pay you triple, you find out what I want to know. And if you find out soon, you get the whole month's salary. -That's all I got to do? -Yeah, and you can't tell anybody, not even Randall. -[ Laughs ] Yeah, caspian Davenport! My daddy says never trust a pirate. -I think you got some pirate blood in you too, Syd. [ Both laugh ] -She's trying to protect US. -We need to use force. -The law is very fuzzy here, but this is our land... From our ancestors. What would they do? -Well, according to my sources, cap's got his eyes set on this undeveloped area here to the west, and this one here to the east. He's partnered with an operation called tiny big town. Got board members that reside in eight states. And they're investing in small shopping villages like this one. -They're wolves in disguise, I swear to ... look, this is ... all these stores are gonna be chains, corporate chains. -It sure as hell doesn't look too good for my taxidermy shop. -I don't think you have to worry too much about any big-chain taxidermy competition. -I know exactly what to do. -[ Singing indistinctly ] Holy buckets. Okay. [ Sighs ] -You're eight minutes late, rock star. Glad you found your room. -Uh-huh. Put your stuff down over there. We have a ton of work to do. -All righty. -Take this. -Uh-huh. Good morning to you, too. -Morning. Take this. You have to keep the stables clean, so rake this up, put it in the wheelbarrow, and there's a compost heap out back. -Okay. Okay, boss. -Have fun. -Yeah. All right. [ Grunts ] [ Spits ] -All done? -Tractor's washed, horses' hay is fresh. I-I couldn't figure out the strap-cutter thing. -You'll learn. There's a fence out by the bluff that needs repairing. -Okay. Well, have fun with that. -You're helping me. [ Clicks tongue ] Come on. [ Clicks tongue ] You coming? In the way. -Well, how do you grip this thing? All right, hold on, hold on, hold on. -Will you hold it a little steadier, please? -Yes, yes. -It's hard to hammer a moving target. -Okay. [ Groans ] Aah! -It is not that hard. Are you kidding? -It's hurting my hands. The next one ... just put it right here. -[ Chuckles ] -Just ... I'll line up perfectly. Here, just hammer it through to the other side. -[ Sighs ] All right. It's done. -Okay. So, we eat now? Are we eating? -Not till we check the rest of them. -All of them?! -[ Chuckles ] -Your place is too big! -Oh, my gosh. You're such a baby. -Whoo! [ Laughing ] Oh! Whoo! [ Laughs ] [ Door creaks ] -[ Panting ] Sorry. Sarah Lou said that I could wash up in here. -She told me how you two met up. -Oh, yeah, that. No, I ... we're ... we're fine. -She ain't done nothing wrong. Just helping clean up other people's messes. -Huh. -Whose mess? -Oh, it's nothing you need to know. Just leave her out of it. -Oh, sure. Yeah. I can do that. Seems like she's already kind of in it, though, you know? -You leave her be. And what's it matter to you, anyway, huh? You're just walking through here, right? -Yeah. You're right. The sooner I'm done with her bossing me around, the happier I'll be. So, thank you for the ... everything. [ Insects chirping ] [ Guitar playing in distance ] -What in tarnation is that? -It's Syd. [ Both chuckle ] -Sounds like a dying owl. -[ Chuckles ] Yeah. Yeah, it does. -What's he doing? -He's trying to play music. -Music? [ Both chuckle ] I never heard any music like that before. -[ Sighs ] Oh, I can't write worth nothing right now.

[ Sniffs ] [ Vehicle approaches ] [ Door creaks ] [ Engine turns over ] -I'll take two grand for it. -It's worth five times that. -Where'd you get this? -Oh, it's been in the family for generations. My great-great granddad bought falcon ranch with what he got out of the gold rush. What was left over, he had the watch made. Tradition has it that whoever's holding that watch is the keeper of the family legacy. I planned to give this to Sarah Lou someday. -Well, if you need the money that bad, how you gonna pay me to get it back? -I got six mares with foal. -I got the yearling that, uh, Sarah Lou's raising. -Come springtime, I'm gonna sell them all off. I'll have enough to pay you back, and then ... then some. -Well, it is a nice piece, jabez. But I can't give you two grand for it. I don't have it. I'll tell you what, though. I'll make a few calls and see if I can...Find someone else you can pawn it to. -Well, I appreciate it. Well, just don't wait too long, okay? -All right. -If I don't have the money at the end of the month, I'm done for. -See you around. Hey. Don't I know you? -No. No. I don't think so. -Boy, oh, boy.

It's been in his family for many generations. Uh, it's worth thousands. He's trying to pawn it, but he hasn't had much luck. -Could we get our hands on it? -You know, I ... I signed on to get you the information. I'm not ... I'm not stealing from this guy. -He'll get it back. I-It'll just go lost for a little while. What I'm doing here, Syd, will benefit nearly everybody in black paw. -You know, cap, there just seems to be a very big difference between this and ... and Jean laffitte, and the whole Robin hood thing. -[ Chuckles ] Why don't you just take this as a little bonus, and I will match it when you bring me the watch. [ Both chuckle ] -Cap, why do you need this ranch?

I mean, that's ... so you can really make stuff move around. -For as long as I can remember. -Wow. But that's ... that's ... that's a great gig. -It's a little strange. -Yeah, so what? Strange is special. That's ... that's ... -you're strange. -[ Chuckles ] Okay. Then we're both a couple of weird weirdos. -Yeah, except everybody already knows you're a weirdo. -[ Chuckles ] Do you think I give a damn? I mean ... -no, I guess you don't. -No, and neither should you. I'm telling you, people would love it. Frank and I, we could hook you up with some music. You could get ... -no. I'm not putting on a show, okay? Not now, not ever. -[ Chuckles ] You were all over me about not going to Portland to do my music. -[ Exhales sharply ] My mother used to do this. And I didn't know her. So this is the only connection I have to her. But I wouldn't expect you to understand that. -I understand that. -I have everything that I want, okay? So I don't you telling me anything else. -I tried, but I'm telling you. -Yeah, you worry about that. I'll, uh, take care of my end. No, I think it's great. No, it's the kind of stimulation that a town needs. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's a demand for it. May not be right now, but soon. All right. Yeah. Just ... just relax. Yeah. It's covered. I got to go. I got another call. Bye. Yeah. -Deputy Bobby here. We got a problem with your sign. You might want to come take a look. -I'll be right there. -All right. -They think this is gonna stop me. You better find them. -It's not that easy, cap. -Do it. Do it, Mike, or black paw's gonna find itself a new sheriff. [ Chuckles ] -Yeah, this is all I can give you for now until I get some things straightened out. -No, no. I know you're good for it. That's ... thank you. -Appreciate that. You're all right, Syd. -[ Chuckles ] Well, wish your granddaughter felt the same way. She... -She seems to like that stuff you call music. -What, she said that? -[ Chuckles ] She didn't have to. No, I was watching her the other night listening to it. Now, me ... it sounded like a bunch of cats screaming in heat. [ Chuckles ] -Yeah, I can see that. That's why the tomcats have been crawling all over me at night. -Yeah. Well, it's an ... an acquired taste, to be sure. But she seems to understand it. -There is so much about that girl that I do not understand. At all. [ Chuckles ] -What do you mean? -Well, she's... [ Sighs ] I don't know. Never mind. Forget it. Forget I said anything. -Listen. If my granddaughter is mixed up in anything, I want to know about it. -Okay. No, of course. I would ... I mean, I'd tell you. I mean, I ... it was ... it's really nothing. I saw her in the barn last night. She was performing something. Or it ... it looked like a performance. I can't ... whatever I saw, she didn't want me to see it. Probably just something in the water. I didn't see anything. You okay? -[ Taps table ] Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. Um...i want you to come with me. There's something I want to show you. [ Sighs ] Sarah Lou's mama. She was quite a woman. She could do some things that most people could never understand. [ Chuckles ] She had a gift. But [sighs] She just got involved with the wrong people. -"Also called 'old ironsides,' this two-deck, three ..." I can't see with my eyes. -Cap, can I talk to you about something? -Yeah, my eyes are just ... -i got to talk to you about something. -What's the holdup on my watch? -You got to leave these people alone. I mean, honestly. Sarah and jabez ... these people don't have anything. They got nothing. -You don't know the whole story, do you? -Uh, no, b-but ... -have a seat. Sarah's mom was a gypsy psychic. She ran off with some carny to the circus, and there was a freak accident, and they were all blown up. I was there that night, and I pulled Sarah Lou out of the fire. She was just a baby. I took her back to jabez. -Did you know Sarah Lou's mother? -Angelica? Yeah. She was the town beauty. She was quite the free spirit. But could she dance. -Mm. She ... she was a dancer. -Yeah. Jabez didn't much appreciate it. But she was a natural. That music would just move around her body. [ Chuckles ] I had never seen anything like it. She'd vibrate, and... -Hmm. -No, that was just back in high school. The woman was out of her mind. She was out of her mind for a long time. She kept claiming that she had telekinetic powers. She used to do this ... this act in the carnival. -Like a magical act. Did you see the act? -It was just one cheap clown trick. -Well, that's ... that's very, uh ... that's very poetic, cap. But you and I just kind of disagree there, okay? -[ Sniffs ] [ Guitar plays ] [ Knock on door ] -Hey, bud. -Hey, man. -Whoa. Fancy, fancy. -You like? -No, not really. [ Both chuckle ] -Hey, did ... did you have any luck with the car? -So, I got some parts on order, so it should be fixed up pretty soon. -This is ... do you ever hear anything about Sarah Lou's mom? -Not really. Why? -No? -Little things here and there. -Well, your dad was telling me something about her running away with the circus or ... -[ chuckles ] Yeah, it's ... it's embarrassing. She was ... she was a little nuts. -Well, I don't think Sarah Lou would think that. -And don't even think about bringing it up with her. -Hey, no, that's all you guys, but might want to talk about that before you get married. [ Clicks tongue ] -You ... you after her now, or ... -no, man. I don't do that. I don't do that. I'm just telling you to appreciate her, okay? Because there's more to that girl than you know. -Hmm. -Yeah, there's just a lot going on that's... [ Door opens ] ...different. -Hey, baby. -Having a nice talk? [ Insects chirping ] [ Guitar playing in distance ] Shh. You're gonna wake granddad with that noise. -Here, tell me. Do you like this? [ Plays chord ] -No. -You don't like that one? How about this one? [ Plays chord ] -[ Sighs ] -Come on. Tell you what. Let me show you a thing or two... -Okay. -...about how a real man rock and rolls. You ready for this? -Mm-hmm. [ Electricity crackles ] -Oh, man. -What did you do? -Frank was supposed to have fixed that. I-I got the lantern. It's ... it's over here. I did put the lantern ... [ cat yowling ] -Watch out for the kitty! Oh, gosh! -Oh, my god, why do you have these things in here? They're everywhere. Aah. Aah, he got me right in the face. -I'm sorry. -Aah. Did you bust me open? -No, I'm sorry. -No? It's not bleeding or anything like that? My eye is not completely ... [ door opens ] -Grandpa must have fixed the fuse. -That's good for him. I'm glad he fix... -yeah. -I'm glad ... I'm glad that he's on that kind of thing. -Mm-hmm. -He's old, you know. -Yeah, the power, so... Goodnight. -Night. If ... I got to get the hell out of here. Hey. I'm out of here. -Well, good morning to you, too. -Yeah, great. I'm done working for you, so I'm getting my car and leaving town. -What's going on? Is that girl working you too hard? -No, no. She's not working me too hard. No, I don't want to be around you anymore, I don't want to be working for you, so I'm leaving, okay? Do you understand that? Do people say "no" to you often? -We have a deal. -Not anymore, we don't. Got it? -I told you this wasn't gonna be easy. -That's nice. That's very nice of you. Yes, I know. You're doing it for them. -I'm not doing it for them. I'm doing it for this whole town. -Oh, god, liars make me sick. That's a pile of crap, you know that? So are you. [ Engine turns over ] -This fellow right here said he'd spot you what you need on that watch. What's the matter? It's what you wanted, wasn't it? -Yeah, I'm thinking, and I just might not pawn it right now, moe. -Well, choice is yours. The offer's there. -You know what? I'm gonna just sleep on it for a while, all right? But I-I appreciate it. -You're welcome. [ Engine shuts off ] [ Thunder rumbles ] -You're leaving? -Yeah. I was gonna say goodbye to you first, though. All right. Should be in Portland by tomorrow if I drive straight through. [ Sighs ] Yeah. Anyway, what are you gonna ... what are you gonna do? -I should be pretty busy with the wedding to plan. -Right. [ Chuckles ] What if you just ... you ... you just did it? You just ... you just took off, you took your act on the road? That's ... that's you. This is you. It's a big part of you, and, man, it makes you so happy. -I just can't. There's no way that I'm gonna leave granddad. Even when Randy and I get married, we're planning on staying in black paw so I can help him. -That's it? -What? -Nothing. Forget it. Please say goodbye to jabez for me. -Yeah. [ Insects chirping ] [ Pulsating tone ] -[ Sighs ] [ Echoing ] You motherless bloodsuckers! [ Knock on door ] -Randy? -You okay? Mm. What's that for? -For being the greatest, most wonderful man I've ever known. -Oh. -Let's set a day for the wedding. -Okay. Sure. When are you thinking? -Tomorrow. -[ Chuckles ] I don't know about tomorrow. I think my mom would probably kill me if I went and married you without her. -Well, as soon as she gets back, then, all right? -Yeah, you're on. Hey, I don't know what's gotten into you, but I'm liking it. -I just can't wait to marry you and spend the rest of my life with you. Let's go out and celebrate tonight. -Okay. [ Chuckling ] Where do you want to go? -How about that new place over in wilcox? -Mm. -Let's go dancing. -You know I don't dance. -It could be fun to try something new, something different. -Mm, I don't need any of that. I'm happy with what I have right here. -[ Sighs ] -All right. I'll tell you what. How about I saddle up, and we'll pack up some food that my mom left, and we can go for a night ride? -Okay. If you'd rather. -It'll be fun. I'll pack some wine and a blanket and a little of this. [ Smooches ] Hmm? -Okay. -Okay, great. -♪ This bursted gate speaks hell in my mind ♪ ♪ but meet me there at dawn, and we will change their minds ♪ ♪ pull back the old and see under the vine ♪ ♪ we will change like wine and be a part of time ♪ ♪ northern lights breaking up the dawn ♪ ♪ don't wait until the moment is gone ♪ ♪ northern lights breaking ♪ this tangled rule brings dust in my mind ♪ ♪ come with me at night and put it on the line ♪ ♪ pull back the ocher and see under the vine ♪ ♪ we will change like wine and be a part of time ♪ -Oh, no.

Let go! -[ Panting ] -[ Coughing ] -[ Voice breaking ] Where is he? I want to see him. -Oh, we can't. -Oh, my god. -No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He's gonna ... he's gonna be fine. They're running some tests, and they told US to wait here, so ... -is he really gonna be all right? -Yeah. He got it really bad, though. I mean, he ... he's a tough old dude, though. He's gonna ... he's gonna make it. -Because of you. [ Sobbing ] I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't come back. -It's okay. It's okay. -What the hell are you doing here? -I got it. I got it. -You got it? -[ Coughs ] -Jabez nearly died. -But I got what you wanted. -Yeah, you didn't have to beat him senseless, now, did you? -He saw my face. -You know, it's a simple job, just take an old pocket watch from a codger. And you just screw up the whole thing. -What if the old man starts talking? -Well, that's your problem. -That's your problem, too. -I don't even want to see this again, okay? Here. Now you get out of here. You keep it. You hear me? Or I'll cook you and eat you myself. Get out! [ Sighs ] -[ Chuckles ] -Oh. [ Chuckles ] -Randy, hi. -Hey. -Hey. -How is he? -He's better. They said he can even go home today. -Well, that's great news. That's great. I'm gonna come stay at the ranch with you guys. -You don't have to. -I know I don't have to, but I want to. Whoever did this to him is still out there. -[ Sighs ] Um, better go check on granddad. -[ Sighs ] What kind of lowlife would do something like this to an old man? I'm telling you, man. I would love to get my hands on this guy. -What's going on? -Where is it? -Where's what? -The watch, the one you stole from jabez! -I don't know anything about a watch. I don't even remember having a conversation with you about some watch. -You vile, little snake in the grass. I can't look at you! Where's the watch, cap?! -You know, maybe I should, uh, call my friend, the sheriff, about you ... tip him off. -You're an evil man, you know that? You got nothing on me, cap. -You sure about that? [ Rooster crows ] -Got it. -Hold it, Syd. You are under arrest for the theft and the assault on jabez. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will ... -it's a lie, you dumb hick. Come on, I'm about to leave town! I'm trying to leave town, already. Aah! Aah! -I know it's asking a lot. I just really need to talk to Syd, okay? -Okay. But if I hear the sheriff coming, you've got to get out of here, fast. -Okay. -Magdalena. Magdalena. Could you please get me a belt? I'm not gonna hang myself. They think I'm crazy here. -I couldn't believe it when they said they think you did it. -Yes, no, I didn't do it. I mean, I was set up. C-Clearly, I-I-I was set up. -By who? -It was cap. -Cap? -Yes, cap. He ... he ... -you're saying cap broke into my house and attacked granddad? -What I'm saying is that he hired somebody to go in and do that. -But why? -Because he wants your ranch, okay? He's trying to screw jabez out of the ranch. -Wait a second. H-How do you know all this? -'Cause he hired me, okay? He hired me to do all this dirty work for him. -He paid you? Yes, but I didn't ... I-I gave the money back. I gave the money back as soon as I ... -but... [ sighs ] -Listen. -This ... this money ... if there ever was any ... you took it in the first place. -I-I-I ... this isn't coming out right. This is ... -yeah, damn straight it isn't. -No, I mean, I needed the money, but I didn't know that it meant stealing. I didn't ... -just spying on US? -No, Sarah, come on. No. [ Sighs ] Sarah, I'm not a bad guy. I'm not a bad guy. -[ Voice breaking ] Just stop it, okay? I don't want to hear any more. -No, no, no. Sarah, you got to believe me. I swear to god I didn't ... I ... I messed up so bad. I swear that I know that i-i-i-i screwed up so bad. I'm really sorry that I screwed up. But I changed my mind, okay? I changed my mind. Then I told cap that I was out. I was getting out of town. -Yeah, and then you came back to steal from my granddad. You could have had him killed. -I didn't do anything to your granddad, and I didn't steal the watch. -Well, they found it in your room. -Yes, because cap put it there 'cause he's a crazy, like, pirate man. He's a crazy person, Sarah. It wasn't me. You got to believe me. I swear. Come on. -Why? I don't even know you. -How'd it go? -It's true. He did it. -He told you that? -No. That would have been decent. Instead, he went and blamed it on your dad. -Are you serious? -[ Crying ] God, how could we have been so stupid? -Don't worry. Come here. [ Sighs ] -Come on in, son. Any word on jabez? -[ Sighs ] Syd's saying it wasn't him. He saying it was you. -[ Chuckles ] You don't believe that line of crock. -No, he's saying somebody planted the watch under his bed. -Well, he'll say anything to take the blame off himself. -But why you, dad? -Syd and I had words. -About what? -Well, I found him paying an awful lot of attention to your fiancée. I'm sure you felt that yourself. -I trust Sarah Lou. -She's not the issue. We opened up our home to Syd. Sarah Lou and jabez gave him a job. And what did he do? Took advantage of all of US. -Yeah. -Here you go. -[ Groans ] I don't know why I'm s-sitting here like some damn invalid. -[ Voice breaking ] Doctor says, granddad, okay? You almost got killed. -Yeah. Well, at least I'm above dirt. [ Grunts ] -Hey, slim. -Let me give you a hand with that, little lady. -Thank you. -Thought I'd stop by and look in on jabez. How's he doing? -Um, he's resting right now. Or he's supposed to be. -That sounds about right. -Yeah. -So, what are you gonna do about the ranch? -I don't know. I didn't want to believe it, but I called the bank, and they said it's true. Falcon ranch is as good as gone. -You're not gonna sell to cap, are you? -Cap? -Yeah. He's been circling around, hounding your granddad with offers. Like that greedy buzzard hadn't picked enough bones clean here in black paw. I tell you, he's not gonna stop till he's bled this town dry. [ Sighs ] Look, i-I'm sorry. I know he's gonna be your new daddy-in-law. But that don't make him any less the bottom-feeder than he already is. Before they arrested that hired hand of yours, I'd have put good money on cappy being behind all this. -[ Scoffs ] -Well, look. You tell your granddaddy "get well," all right? -I will. -We need him back in the fight. [ Telephone ringing ] -You son of a bitch. -Grandpa, what are you doing? What's going on? Are you all right? Granddad? -It wasn't him. It w-wasn't Syd. -[ Sighs ] -An attack against jabez is an attack against all of US. It's time that we fight back, preserve and protect what is our birthright. And Sarah Lou is here to tell US how we do that. -[ Sighs ] We need to find out what's going on. Syd didn't attack granddad. He saved granddad. But he's sitting in jail while the real criminal is getting away with it. And Syd says it's cap. -I told y'all! We should have stepped up our game. Now jabez is the worst off for it. I'll fire-bomb his damn house for you, Lou Lou, if that's what you want. -No, don't go burning anything down, okay? [ Chuckles ] Granddad wouldn't want that. He's got another way ... a better way. But we're gonna need all of your help. [ Indistinct conversations ] I want to thank you all for turning out like this to support my granddad. It would surely warm his heart to see you all here, which is why I'm doing this. We're gonna film it, so thank you, Paul. It's sort of a movie version of a get-well card for granddad, to show him what all the good people of black paw can do when we stick together and do what's right by him and by our town. [ Cheers and applause ] [ Eerie music plays ] [ Crowd murmuring ] -Must be magnets involved. I never knew she could do that. -Me neither. -[ Whistles ] Incredible. -That's incredible. [ Cheers and applause ] -[ Chuckles ] [ Cheers and applause ] -Yeah! [ Cheers and applause ] [ Electricity crackles ] [ Rumbling ] [ Crowd murmurs ] [ Power drains ] -Syd's amp. It puts out a surge that's too powerful for ground protection. My own personal design. [ Footsteps ] -Who's that? -Shut your trap, son. We're here to break you out of here. -What? -Shh! -Shh! -Could you be any noisier? Where are the keys? -Well, just where they're supposed to be. -Yeah, and they're not the right ones. Can't you do anything right, milt? -Looking for this? [ Sighs ] Hurry up. The sheriff will be back soon. He's out with the electric company. -Ha! -What's going on? -Sarah Lou's working her magic. Now, come on, before that clown sheriff figures out how to find his way in the dark. -[ Humming ] -Syd! Thank god you're all right. So sorry you have to be stuck in here. -Are you kidding me? This is way better than a jail cell and a cot. [ Chuckling ] Sarah, I can't believe you did that for me. -And for granddad and everybody else in this town. You were right about cap. He wants our ranch. He wants the whole town. We have to stop him. -Sarah, how are you gonna do that? -I just have to figure out what he's up to. It has to be more than what everybody thinks to be doing what he's done. I'm so sorry that I didn't believe you at first. -I'm a liar. I lie a lot. That's why people won't usually believe me. [ Chuckles ] -I'm gonna make this up to you, okay? I promise. -You already have. You should get going. -[ Sighs ] I'll be back. [ Device beeping ] [ Beeping continues ] -Shut it! Shut that light off. Now, you sure this whole area's in it, too? -I've scanned it several times. I think you're golden. You're gonna want to bring in a different team to do some more analysis, but there is oil under this ranch. There's oil under the next ranch and pretty much the whole town. I'm almost positive of it. -Well, you just, uh, get going. And you do it quietly. We don't want nobody to know you're here. And you call back your friends over at gralyn. You set them scallywags up with their meeting with me. Turn that light off! -Oh. Sorry. [ Knock on door ] -Come on. Open it, huh? -Oil! Oil! -What are you talking about? Of course, oil! That, uh ... cap. He was here. -What are you doing here? -Sorry. Sorry. Cap was on the ranch. I saw him over by the bluff. -Did he see you? -No. No, he was with frank, and I heard them ... I heard ... I overheard them talking. And, uh, there's oil under here, and ... -on ourranch? -Yes, yes. And this is why cap is after the ranch. This is why cap is acting so crazy. He's ... he's oil-hungry. He's ... -okay, okay, so if what you're saying's true, and there's oil, and cap wants it ... -yes. -No, he wouldn't almost have granddad killed to steal from my granddad, no. -Cap is crazy! He's a crazy man, and he's doing what he can to get the oil! He's trying to choke it out of people! -Okay, all right! I have to go. -Wait, where are you going? No, no, no. -I have to go talk to Randy. -You can't go talk to ... what are you ... are you hearing what I'm saying? It's cap! He's crazy! So Randy ... you can't talk to cap or Randy. No. -I need to talk to my fiancée, all right? Stay here with granddad. -But ... [ Sighs ] Be careful! -[ Grunts ] -Syd busted out of jail. What the hell am I supposed to do now? -Nothing. You do nothing. Now, they found that watch in his room. Thank god you didn't screw thatup. It made him look even more guilty that he broke out of jail. -What about the old man? -Well, he doesn't remember much yet. But you better hope he doesn't remember anything. -The way I see it, you best be the one hoping. -You know... I could kill you right now. And nobody would even care, and nobody would even know... Especially if jabez wakes up and he remembers that you were the one who put him in the hospital. Not me. You know, I-I like these tall trees in my driveway. You know what pirates call hanging? A short step to a long drop. You get it? Yeah, I get you. -Get off my property. Sarah Lou. -Hey, cap. I just came by to see Randy, s-so ... -why are you so nervous? -I'm not nervous. -Oh, yes, you are. You've never been nervous around me before. What's going on? -N-Nothing. -Why don't we go inside and talk, huh? Come on. -Let me go. -It's all right. -Stop it! -All right. It's all right. Go on upstairs. [ Door slams ] -Let go of me! -This is not what it appears to be. -It appears to me you tried to Rob from my family, and you almost got my granddad killed. You're not gonna get away with it. -Don't make me shoot, Sarah Lou. -What the hell is the matter with you?! -I never wanted anybody to get hurt. -I know all about you finding out there's oil under the ranch. That's what's behind all this. You tried to screw everybody over by buying their land up cheap so that you could make a killing. Well, you're gonna have to kill me to keep me from turning you in. -[ Clicks tongue ] -Randy, oh, my god! -Dad. Give me that gun. Give me the gun, dad. What the hell is going on? -Syd was right. Everything he said was true. Your dad did it! He did everything! Your dad is a devil! -Don't you believe a word she says. You ask her where she was tonight. Remember all that talk I told you about her hanging out with that trailer trash? Ask her where she was tonight. Ask if she broke him out of jail. -Is that ... is that true? Did you get him out? -Yes, but he's innocent. -Sarah Lou. -Randy, he didn't do anything. -Do you love him? -Randy. -Ugh. -I just connected with him. -You connected ... don't tell me that you connected! You barely know the guy! -He just showed me something I didn't know ... -what ... what ... the guy's a nobody! He's a bum who will never amount to anything! -He's more than you'll ever be. You shut up, all right?! You shut the hell up! How could you say that to me?! Talk to me like that. -Aah! I got him bad. Ay! Whoa! -[ Chuckles ] Long John silver lived amongst some of the wickedest people that god ever allowed on the sea. -Ow! -Ah. -What are you talking about? -Robert Louis Stevenson. If you ever read anything instead of making that noise that you call music, you might be a worthy opponent. But let's see anyway. [ Laughs ] Remember what I told you? Bend, yes. Now die. Keep your knees bent. Hands behind your back. Hyah. Hyah. And then we lunge! -Freeze, cap! -You won't shoot. -I will! I swear I will! -No, you won't. [ Panting ] It's not loaded. Jean laffitte lives on. In Byron's immortal words, "he left a corsair's life to other times, linked by one virtue and a thousand crimes." [ Chuckles ] Adieu. -No, stop. Just ... just let him go. He won't get very far. -Well, that ought to about take care of it. Randy's owned up to what he's done. They found monster over in wilcox. He's squealing cap out from here to Tuesday. -[ Chuckles ] -We'll track him down. I'm sorry for all the trouble we gave you. Charges are dropped. You're free to come and go as you please. -There's something I want to give you, okay? -Okay. You were gonna sell this. -I want you to have it. -What about the bank? -[ Groans ] Fundraiser's gonna take care of the ranch for quite some time. -[ Chuckles ] [ Click ] -[ Exhales sharply ] -[ Gasps, chuckles ] Thank you, granddad! I suppose you'll be taking off for Portland now. -Yeah. Yeah, I'm excited to get on the road. Got a long way to drive. I do love taking off, though. Love that. Freeing. What about you? What are you gonna do next? -Well, it's not like granddad would ever go for selling to the oil company. So I guess I'll just keep doing what I've been doing. -That's it? -I don't have anywhere else to go like you do. My life's here, you know? With granddad and with the land. -There's a lot of it. -Yeah. [ Laughs ] -Tending to cows, you and your cats. Be a farm girl for the rest of your life. That sounds good. -What? Why are you always smiling like that?! -No, nothing. Nothing. What if you didn't have to leave to find what you're looking for, Sarah? -What do you mean? -Come on. -[ Laughs ] What are you doing? Why are you bringing me in here? -Just keep an open mind, huh? Stand right there. What do you see? -[ Sighs ] A barn. -Okay. Okay.
