Whoever breaks is gonna be a little puppy! [chuckling] Seriously, what do you want to do when you grow up? [Boy 1] Hmm, not sure. I never really thought about it. [Girl 1] When I grow up, I'm gonna be a famous violinist, in America. No, all over the world. You're gonna be my biggest fan, following me wherever I go. [scoffs] In your dreams. I don't want to be your puppy following you around everywhere. It's not up to you. [laughing] Drinking Maotai in the US isn't an easy task. Thank you. My boss always said he can't take me anywhere.

I can't make it tonight. You guys have fun and Say hi to Lenny for me. Talk to you later. [music] She's been distant for years. [thud] Let's go and find her! Her place is just around the corner. Go left from the restaurant. No, no. [Sandy] Damn, I don't remember clearly. Anyways it's some filthy back alley. I only remember there was a black cat and rats. I don't how she can stand living in that place. [woman singing in the background] [sighs] Take care of her. Don't worry, I'll take her home. Lenny, don't go! Drink some more with us!

Erm, sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you. I just saw you sitting here alone and [Man 3] Can I at least offer you some champagne? To make up for my rudeness? It's warm, um, probably flat. [chuckles] Look, I'm not trying to hit on you or anything. You just look really familiar and I know how lame that sounds, but it's true. Just a small cup? [chuckles] All right. [Jasmine] But after this, I really have to go. Okay. So let's start over. To random meetings on York city rooftops. To strangers. [fireworks cracking] Look at this. This city can be real shithole but every now and then she's beautiful. [fireworks cracking] You know, if you focus hard enough, every sparkle is a dream that can come true. At least that's what my grandma used to tell me. [Jasmine] But eventually they fade away. So maybe it can be something simple. [Man 3] Like a moment that we wish could last forever. Well, thank you. For what? For tonight and for that. It's pretty good. Warm and flat. Are you leaving? Yeah, I really have to go. Hey, wait, what's your name? [fireworks exploding] [Host] Beijin. You are the host to the present. And the gateway to the future. [crowd cheering] [Female Analyst] 2008 was a year that many investors around the world will want to forget. With plunging home prices and rising foreclosures. The housing problem snowballed into an economic crisis that we haven't seen since the great depression. [Charlie] The city's on fire! You know, they got rid of Bill last night, right? What? He is a Senior Analyst. They can't do that? They can do anything they want, Charlie. We're in banking. If the numbers don't crunch, they don't crunch. Well, everybody's head is on the line, including ours. The party is over. [laughing] What? You're so dramatic, man. Is this your artist fantasy cropping up again? Huh? I've told you, being an artist sounds really good on paper, but money gives you choices. You've got your pick of all these women, even if you don't want them, you've got the choice. Come on, this is New York! There's always another deal to make. All right. May I? You may. [Man 3] Just this once, don't get any ideas. [Jasmine] Mom, don't worry. It's all good here. Our band is selling out the house every night. Mom, really don't worry. New York has been through it all. [Jasmine's mother] I know your career is going well, but it's about time to think about your own personal issue. You're not young anymore. Remember the guy I introduced to you last time? He is great, fit, checks all the boxes. [Jasmine] Mom! Career, then boyfriend! You're never gonna stop, are you? [Jasmine's mother] Okay, okay. [indistinct chatter in distant] Hello. [indistinct chatter in tv] Hello? [indistinct chatter in tv] [Jasmine] Hello, anybody? [indistinct chatter in tv] [sighs] [indistinct chatter in tv] [Man 3] Hi, hello. [clears throat] Oh. Are you Mr. Heron? Yeah. Oh, you ordered Chinese take-out. And I've been calling you for a while. It's $42.50, please. Just a second. [sighs] Here. Here you go. Thanks. And your receipt. I don't need the receipt, keep the change. Oh, thank you. Hey, uh, hold on. We've met before. [chuckles] Yeah, on a roof top, on the 4th of July. I offered you the warm and flat champagne. Ugh. Just a small cup. [laughing] - Yeah? - Oh, yes. - The warm and flat champagne. - Yeah. Now I remember. So, it's your thing right? Charming strangers at random locations. I'm sorry. - I'm Joe. - Uh, Jasmine. Nice to meet you. It's nice to see you again. Uh, I really have to go. Kind of running late, thank you. Uh, hold on a second. Wait, this is my card. It's an old car but the number is still good. Just ignore all the stuff, just the number. [exhales] I'm kind of in the middle of a change. Actually, I'm putting together my first art show. [gasps] That's great. Would you be interested sitting for me? - Me? - Yeah. Uhm. I keep on replaying that image of you standing there alone on the roof top. You were really far away, in this beautiful sparking white dress. You're tiny in the vast landscape, it's almost like a surrealistic painting. Thank you. I don't know, but I'll think about it. Okay, great. Thank you. Bye. Bye. [music] [Deacon] Mrs. Lin, are you absolutely sure that you really want to give your life to this man? Mr. Lian, do you have the courage to marry this gorgeous woman? Do you? [music] [Joe] Do you ever get homesick? [Jasmine] This is home. Come on, you know what I mean. I'm talking about China. [Joe] I mean, your whole family is there, right? Yeah. But I don't know. It's like when you spent half of your life in one country, and half in another. It's sort of like you don't know where you belong. [Joe] Sense of belonging. Maybe we don't have to belong anywhere. You are amazing with the camera, like total natural. I still can't believe I'm doing this. Seems so unreal. [sighs] Trust me, compared to what I used to do, this is as real it gets. So, no more banking for you? Something about making money out of thin air was not something I was ever really proud of. You know, the money was good, life was glamorous but none of it was real. Well, your new life, it suits you. [chuckles] I'd better get going. Come on, you always have to go. I mean, I've known you almost a year now, right? I mean, I still don't know what you do, where you live, who you are, I know you do a good Annie Hall. Isn't it better this way? [music] [Young Jasmine] I grow up, I'm going to be a famous violinist in America. No, all over the world. You are going to be biggest fan, following me wherever I go. In your dreams. [Young Lenny] I don't want to be your puppy following you around everywhere. [Young Jasmine] It's not up to you. [music] [Mr. Goldberg] We are witnessing the world's two greatest economies coming together in a way they never have before. China is the fastest growing and most dynamic economy on the planet. China is the future. To China. Hey, you made it! - Good to see you guys. - To China! Come on! Mr. Goldberg, I'd like to introduce you to Lenny. Lenny's the youngest CEO I've been talking about. Nice to meet you. [music] * [applause] You look very beautiful tonight. Thanks. I never thought I would see you in America. Me neither. We've been changed. [siren blaring] I actually came to New York last year. I wanted to see you but I was afraid. Last year, I was in the exact same place, doing the same job, living the same life. Nothing has changed. It's as if time has stopped. [Lenny] Jasmine I'm sorry. I always wish time could wash away. It's all in the past now. After so many years, I'm finally seeing you again. It's really great. [Tour guide] Hello everyone, ahead of us is the Statue of Liberty, one of the most recognizable icons in the United States and the world. [Jasmine] She is the symbol of freedom, hope and opportunity. As you can see, on her left side she's holding a stone tablet with the engraved text "July 4th, 1776" to remember American independence day. And on her right hand side, she's holding a flaming torch. [chuckles] [seagulls squawking] I'm really impressed by you. You're so knowledgeable about American history. That's my job, I have been doing it for a long time. After hearing what you have said, the American Dream makes more sense to me now. Before I came to America, this is the place I want to come visit the most. At that time I felt as long as I work hard, nothing is impossible. But I've realised now, as time passes, people change, things change and sometimes dreams also change. Some things, once they are washed away, they will never come back. There are some things in life that never change. I have a great Idea. [music] Actually, I came here last night. What do you mean? In my dream. [taking deep breaths] This is it! [Jasmine] This is the top of the word. [Lenny] In my dream, it wasn't with you. I was with an old man. I was really confused, so I asked the old man, "What is the meaning of the view?" The old man replied, "The view is a reflection of your emotions." So I asked, what's the meaning of those spirits? The old man said, "Without the essence of our souls, we cease to exist." Then I asked, "What is the meaning of the water?" The old man said to me, "It is delicate yet sparking flow." Finally I asked, "What is the meaning of me?" He replied, "You're sophisticated and high class gentleman." [both chuckling] You haven't changed one bit. [laughing] [music] [Jasmine] I never imagined, we'll be here together one day. Hey, Jas, it's Joe. Uh, hope your day's panning out good. Listen, if you have time to drop by the studio, please do, okay? Because I've got something really, really strong to show you. Okay? I'll talk to you later. Okay, bye. [sighs] "Three treature Beijing delight", enjoy your meal. Sure! Thank you. "Sorry I can't make it today." [music] [laughing] [music] It's really the city of dreams. [Lenny] Still planning to be the most famous violinist in the world? The most beautiful violinist in the world. [music] [Jasmine] That was just a childish dream. [music] Anyways for now, I need to make some money first. [music] [laughing] [Lenny] Actually, I'm quite impressed by you. You spent all these years abroad on your own. Have you ever thought about going back? [Jasmine] Sometimes. But I always felt if I don't make something of myself I can't go back. [music] Enough about me. Sandy's been talking about your life as if it's a fairy-tale. [Jasmine] It's your turn. [Lenny] I never told you before, that year I disappeared from school was because my grandma passed away. She was the only family I had. Since then, I've worked really hard to make enough money just to survive. I polished shoes, delivered newspapers on the streets, sold scraps, carried boxes. I did anything, no matter how horrible it was. I had only one goal in mind is to have my grandma in heaven be proud of me. After that it turns out heaven lent me a helping hand. A very rich man helped me out. [Lenny] You could say, he gave me everything I have now. He taught me how to make money, lots of money. But he is not happy with his life. His wife decided to leave him. She fell in love with someone who had nothing, but made her happy. He was miserable. He tried so many ways to get his wife to stay. She only had one thing to say to him, that she just wanted to be free. He couldn't say anything but watched her go. He's an old man now. Full of regrets and waiting to die. [music] [Lenny] I haven't chatted to anyone like this in a long time. [Jasmine] Me too. Sorry, my apartment is right there. You can stop there. I'll see you to your door. It's fine, I can see myself in. - Jasmine. - Uh? Tomorrow night, can I invite you to join me at a dinner with some colleagues? I heard it's a very famous steak restaurant. It will only be a few people. I'd love you to be translator. I will pick you up at 7, tomorrow evening. Mhm. [music] [cell phone ringing] [cell phone ringing] Hello? [Lenny's wife] Lenny, how have you been? You haven't called since you arrived in New York. I've been very worried about you. I'm sorry. It's been a very tight schedule. And my jet lag is still pretty bad. How's dad? That's why I kept trying to reach you. His condition has gotten worse. What did the doctor say? It's not looking good this time. They can't say anything for sure. It all depends on how he does next week. Can you come back earlier? [sighs] I'll have to close the deal tomorrow evening. I'll try to catch the earliest flight back after that. I'm going to sleep. Lenny. Good night. So, I'm waiting for my invite in the mail any day now. Your first exhibition. [music in the background] Yeah, I don't need reminding. Come on, dude you said a year. [Charlie] So things not going too well? [sighs] I don't know, some days I'm just fucking frozen. I mean it's been a year. I feel like everybody's just waiting for me to fail especially my old man, just to prove he is right. Look, just trade your pride for your dream. Alright? Go back to your folks, tell them you're sorry, take the money. This is starving artist routine isn't helping anybody. I think something clicked for me. There is a woman that I met. There's something different about her, I mean, the way she looks, the way the light catches her eyes. It's weird, it's like everytime I look at her, I feel [music] I feel like I've known her my whole life but I don't know anything about her. [music] [phone ringing] [grunting] Hi. I was just looking at you. [Jasmine] What do you mean? I was looking on the photos. What's up? [Jasmine] Do you? Do you think things always come full circle in life? Oh, I'm sorry, I know it sounds crazy but I'm just throwing random feelings to a stranger. But if it does come full circle, does that mean that we always go back to where we started? I mean, it's a pretty scary thought. Or, maybe it's that perfect ending that we all wish for. Interesting. I think, that we need to continue this conversation over dinner and wine, a date? [takes deep breath in] Tomorrow night? Can't do tomorrow night. A woman who never stops. Night. Night. What is it? Nothing. Shall we go? [Man 1] To the future, China and America. Cheers. Cheers to America and China. - Cheers. - Cheers. Jasmine. I have to say, you're the most beautiful translator I have seen. Oh, no. But thank you, I'm flattered. Saying, she's beautiful. [Man 1] Jasmine, how long have you and Lenny known each other? Lenny and I a long time. They know each other since years old, right? And I know this guy over 10 years. Cool huh? Very cool! You really keep your people around. Some people in our lives we never let go of. Yes, he said fate is very precious. Guess we have something in common. The Jews and Chinese are brothers! [Jasmine] The Jews and Chinese are brothers! Brothers! Let's toast to our friendship. Cheers. Mmm, mmm. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to dear Jasmine ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday. Thank you. [cheering and clapping] Thank you, everyone. Happy birthday, Jasmine. And Lenny, New York is your second home now. And safe travel back to China tomorrow, Lenny. Let's toast again to our friendship. At the time, let's toast to Jasmine's birthday. Cheers. Cheers! They wish you a safe trip back home. [siren blarring] Sorry, there is something urgent in Beijing that I have to take care of. Will you ever comeback? Of course, very soon. Of course, another 10 days just flew by. This afternoon I have to see an apartment. There is a beautiful view of Central Park. It's a good size, not too big or too small, and very quiet. It sounds like a great investment. Actually I feel that that place is perfect for you. I really want to help you, I want to help you make your dreams come true. I'm fine! Jasmine, I'm not just anyone. My dreams are gone. I know there are many things that money can't buy. But I know this way I can at least help you a little. I owe you. [music] [Young Lenny] Do you like it? [Young Jasmine] It's beautiful. Thank you. [music] You really have to go America? Of coruse, it's my dream. You've always known that. [music] [Siren blaring] [screeching] Careful! I can't let you go. Jasmine, I love you. [music] [thunder rolling] [thudding] Who is it? [crying] Jas? [sobbing] Come on, come on. Woah, come on. [sighs] Okay, okay, okay. Okay. [Joe] Just sit right there. [thunder rolling] No, no, no. Come on, come on. Jas, Jas, Jas! Come on, you've had enough. [sighs] [Joe] It's gonna be okay, Jas. Hey. I don't know why I'm here. [sobbing] I don't understand. Shh. I just don't want to be alone tonight. I don't want to be all alone by myself. Okay, I'm here. [sobbing] You are not alone okay? I'm here. I'm with you. I'm here. [crying] How can he just come and go whenever he wants. [sobbing] I want to hate him, but I can't. [music] Jas? "Joe, I'm sorry, have to go Jas." [music] * [music] [phone ringing] "Sorry, the number you've dialed is unavailable right now." "Please try again later." [indistinct chatter] Jasmine! Hey! - How are you darling? - Good to see you. [kisses] Didn't think you could make it. Me neither. It's such a great turn out today. [clears throat] Oh, Jasmine, this is Gary. Gary, Jasmine. Pleasure meeting you. She is the woman behind and in front of all these wonderful works, and my boss. Well, it's great to meet you Jasmine. Congratulations! - We're loving this. - Thank you. Well, he's very talented. Have you seen Joe yet? No. I saw him doing some press earlier. Oh, that's alright. I'll go to find him. - Well, see you guys later. - Bye. Nice to meet you. She used to be Joe's muse for years, ditched him for a rich guy. And now Drama. [chuckles] [music] Didn't think you'd make it. [Joe] You look beautiful. And you look handsome. You are not trying to hit on me, are you? [chuckles] You know, everyone keeps asking me who this woman is. And what do you say? That she's a mystery. [music] [indistinct chatter] Joe, oh excuse me. Emma, Art View Magazine. - Hi. - Hi. [Emma] I just wanted to say hi. - [Emma] Congratulations! - Thank you. - I love your art. - That's so kind of you. So emotional, so raw. [indistinct chatter] [notification sound] "Sorry, I'm really trying my best." "Please believe me, are you okay?" [music] Where to? You'll see. Are you kidnapping me? If you'll let me, I'll kidnap you. See that rooftop? Yes. That's where I saw you for the first time, 4 years ago. You totally captivated me, it's like you were from a different era, a different world. Actually, I was also watching you. An artist trapped in a suit. [laughing] [music] Come on. [laughing] Here, can I help? Come on, give me your hand. [chuckling] Here, give me your hand. [laughing] - [Joe] You're alright? - [Jasmine] No. - [Joe] No? - [Jasmine] Of course, not. [Jasmine] Is it bad to abandon your own party? [Joe] Very. Your work is beautiful. You see me in a way I have never imagined myself. [Joe] Maybe I can see, who you really are. [music] I'm sorry, I just needed some time. I felt trapped, like I couldn't breath anymore. I know. After that night, I didn't think I was ever going to see you again. And I understood how you felt. I know you always do. [laughing] Anyways, the future is bright. You are gonna be a star. [music] [phone vibrating] [music] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Hey. I've been trying to reach you all night. Last night? I was busy at the art show. It was a madness. Art show? The first show at our gallery, remember? I'm sorry, I forgot. Did it go well? It went really well. The reviews were good. You know I was so excited last night. So many people came and they all thought it was a big success. Also the artist is very talented. You know, I know nothing about art. [birds chirping] Of course, as long as you're happy. Are you alright on money? I miss you. All I want right now is to see you. Lenny, I feel that [clears throat] Nothing. It's already very late there. You should get some rest. [birds chirping] [Woman 2] Joe Heron's first major multi-platform show opened with a bang. A glittering array of celebrities and press to support this new artistic talent whose now trademark style features an unknown Asian woman. - Who could that be? - Oh, I don't know. [laughing] Oh my god. There's something brave about your work that transgresses boundaries between art, moving image, architecture and music. Heron, a former city banker who lost his job and gambled everything on what he describes as his 'dream', has found meaning in the achingly beautiful work that touches its audience deeply. Wow, this is amazing. - Can I take a look? - Yes. Thanks. This is actually quite amazing. It was so smart to buy that gallery, Jas. And you bought at the right time too. Thanks. New artists come and go everyday so let's wait and see. [music] [sizzling] So, Joe, the master. Are you happy? The reviews are wonderful. Yeah, I'm happy. Thank you, for believing in me. Thank you. [sizzling] I think the beef's burning. You are not gonna burn down my house, are you? - Don't worry. - Don't worry? This is my house, it isn't your house! You know, I've got to say, I never had you down as a top chef. Well, there's a lot you don't know about me. [chuckles] [phone vibrating] [phone ringing] "Sorry, number you've dialed is unavailable right now." [exhales] [Lenny] I love you. [Jasmine] Is that what you say to her too? [music] Lenny, I miss you. [Jasmine] The only reason I'm in this place is because I want to feel you next to me, even just a little bit. But, where are you? I can never find you. [Oliver] Hey, if my own brain is still working, isn't it your birthday soon? - Thanksgiving right? - Mhmm. Doing anything to celebrate? Hmm, let me think. I'm gonna stuff myself in turkey so you can't find me. Oh, darling, from my understanding, you're still a baby. We have to do something to celebrate. How's the gorgeous Joe? He's okay. Well, we're working on the new project. And? And? - Nothing. - Come on! [gasping] Sweetie, a word of advice. Have some fun, fool around and don't fall in love, not with an artist. They are worse than actors. [music] [phone ringing] [sighs] I love you. [phone ringing] But do you love me? I love, is too weak a word. I "luve" you, I "louve" you, "I loffe" you, I need two "f's". [chuckling] Can't you be serious? I am being serious, that's what Woody Allen sounds like. No? [music] [phone ringing] [beep] [beep] [crying] [Lenny] The old man who had saved my life was my father-in-law. He just passed away. Right up to his last breath. He still couldn't forgive himself for not making his wife happy. I want to see you Jas, really miss you. [music] Go! [music] [cheering] - Let's drink. - Drink up. Yan Yan, Li Yan. Congratulations to you! - Congrats! - Bottoms up. Congrats, your life has ended before it began. All brothers and sisters, here's to the end! Woo-hoo! Drink, drink! - Cheers, bottoms up. - Wonderful.

Don't you know I've been so worried about you? I'm just calling to see how you are doing. Jas, I feel like we're becoming further and further apart. I don't even know what you're doing everyday. Nothing, I know nothing. You're drunk. I don't want to talk about it now. Apart from money, I can't give you anything. Money? Do you really think money i everything? I don't give a shit about money! Me neither. I'm not your mistress. What do you mean by "my mistress?" What do you mean by this? Do you know, you're the only person I've ever loved. I have loved you, all my life!

I mean, just you and I. [Jasmine] Under the same roof. Just us. [Lenny] You know, that is my greatest wish. I wish everything could start all over again. [music] [Jasmine] Do you believe in fate? Some people are just not meant to be, no matter how hard they try. Are you implying, you and I? [Jasmine] No. I was just wondering. You know, sometimes you scare me. The way you talk, it's like you're gonna be gone again. [taking deep breaths] [music] [birds chirping] [music] [thud] [traffic honking] [Joe] Why did you come to me that night? [Jasmine] To be honest, I don't even know. I just ran and ran. Until I realized I had nowhere to go. And there you were. [music] Brother, take care. [Joe] So, I grew up here till my grandfather passed away. [Jasmine] And your parents? Three generations under this roof. Three generations? That's a big happy family. "Passengers flying to New York please pay attention." There was only four of us. It was always quite. We only saw each other at dinners and even then it was quiet. It was like sometimes the only noise in this house was piano. You know, when I was a kid I used to think I can see the shadows of my grandparents walk in these halls. It is probably just my imagination but I really thought I saw it. Would you play for me? - Really? - Yes. Please. Okay. [music] Who is that? - Oh, that's me. - That's you? Oh, you were a chubby kid. I was a chubby kid. Oh, my god so cute! I wasn't that chubby. I had like a belly. I can see that. I was forced to look into the camera. [laughing] [music] [Joe] She was my fiancé. Her name is Veronica. And you say I'm the mystery. It was a long time ago. It's strange being here. All this reminds me of everything that I've been running away from. What happened? I let her slip away. I couldn't commit, I was stupid. But I didn't want to be like my parents. Living in this beautiful house, living like strangers. You know, the first time I saw you at the rooftop, you reminded me of her the way you held yourself. So, am I her shadow? No. You're my saviour. I ran away from all this. I was torn about it that I shut myself off, for years. What I'm trying to say is that, I know where you've been, Jas. And I'm in love with you. It took me like a really long time to find the courage to love you because I don't want to lose you again. I can't lose you again. [music] I don't want to go anywhere anymore. I just want to be with you. [music] [birds chirping] [crickets chirping] [birds chirping] "Happy birthday!" [chuckles] - Morning! - Morning. I'm glad you're still here. I was scared that you'd run away again. No, no more running. [birds chirping] [birds chirping] Have you been up long? For a while. It's really peaceful here. Yeah, this was my escape. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. I used to swim in there. - Yeah? - Mhmm. Oh, it looks freezing. It is. What are you doing? You are kidding? Oh, you're not serious! Joe? You are crazy! - I am! - [Jasmine] Joe! - [Jasmine] You are insane! - Wooh! Oh, my god are you insane? Oh! Come here, come here. I am crazy! [chuckling] Are you? ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - Come here. - Okay, help me out. You wanna come in? - No, I don't think so. - No, are you sure? I don't think so, let go, let go. - Come on! - I mean it. [laughing] Are you okay? Oh my god. - You alright? - I'm freezing. No, I'm not alright. What the hell are you thinking? Sorry, sorry! Come on, let's get back. [screaming] Are you okay? Get away from me! [deep breaths] [grunting] Are you alright? [taking deep breaths] Leave me alone! You don't know anything about me! I know you love somebody else! [breathing slows] [music] [sighs] Look I'm sorry about what I said. Me too. Let's start fresh. I'll see you tonight? That's the plan. [kisses] [music] [lift bell rings] Happy birthday. I wanted to surprise you. Would you like a drink? Water, coke, whiskey, wine and Mao Tai? I didn't realize you like Mao Tai. In case one day, you might come back. Happy birthday. Thanks. [sipping] [coughing] [coughing] [gargling] [spit] [water running] Lenny? How was the exhibition? Great. Lenny, there's something I want to tell you. I want to meet him. [cheering] - Hi! - She is here, birthday girl! [Helen] Happy birthday! Thank you for coming. [kisses] Thank you for coming, birthday girl. - Oh, darling thank you. - Happy birthday, darling. Thank you. Oh, this is Lenny, my friend from China, and he is here on a business trip. Lenny, I'm Oliver, pleasure to meet you, welcome to New York. Hello, I am Helen, nice to meet you. Please, join us. Oh Jasmine, that dress looks gorgeous on you. I was hoping this color will bring me luck today. Can I get you guys some drinks? Champagne, please. Big bottle. [laughing] Did you guys do anything for today? Actually, nothing special. Oh, well, that's about to change. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. - Happy birthday, Jas. - Aww. [Helen] Hope you like it. We worked really hard. We went on a whole shopping trip together. [Oliver] The whole day. [Helen] Oh, we're so rude. Do you like rose, Lenny? - It's amazing. - [Lenny] It's amazing. Thank you. [music] [kisses] Sorry, I'm late. Hi, I'm Joe. Hi Joe, Helen. - [Joe] It's nice to meet you. - [Helen] Nice to meet you. - [Oliver] I'm Oliver. - [Joe] Hi, nice to meet you. [Oliver] Pleasure to meet you. Hey man, I'm Joe. [Joe] Nice to meet you. This is Lenny, my friend from China, and he just happens to be in town. How are you? Hello. Wow. That's it. It's all the Chinese that know of. I swear she's gonna give up on me. Well, before me. [Waiter] Would you like me to open it for you, Ma'am? Yes, please. [cheering] - [Helen] Nice! - [Oliver] Celebration! So, I was late. Yes? Because I had to pick it up at the printers. [gasps] [Jasmine] Can I save it for later? You sure you don't wanna see it now? I think you're gonna love it. You're beautiful in it. - Oh. - You're gonna love it. You guys want to see it? - Yeah! - Absolutely! Joe. You grab that side, okay. Open it. [Oliver] Stunning! - [Helen] It's incredible, Joe. - [Joe] It's all her. [Joe] Every look that she gives me is full of beauty and strength. I swear she's the strongest person I know. [Oliver] That's Jasmine for you. [chuckles] It's lovely. [Helen] How about a toast to the birthday girl? Cheers! - Cheers, to the birthday girl! - Cheers! [Helen] Happy birthday, Jasmine. [Oliver] Happy birthday. [Helen] Joe, Jasmine was just telling us about the new show you are working on? Yeah, it's a series of four shows called China Girl. They're just talking about Joe's new show. [music] Do you love him? [music] So, Lenny, how long have you known Jasmine for? Whole life. Wow, that's wonderful. [music] [indistinct chatter] You can't smoke in here. [Helen] Is he okay? Yeah, I think so, probably just jet lag. [Helen] Oh yeah, that flight is crazy. I can't believe he is still standing. He must care a lot about you to be here now. I think I'm gonna go check up on him, all right? [Helen] Of course. Don't worry, we'll take care of Joe. I'm sorry. Since my grandma died, I've promised myself I won't let my family go again. I meant you. I watched you going to school and back home in secret. I wished you happy birthday from afar. Watched you laugh and cry. Just now, I suddenly realized everything, our love is just an illusion, or a dream that will never come true! It's not a dream. [traffic whooshing] We've been through so much. Do you know how hard I've tried? I know you have too. I saw you belong to that world there. [siren blaring] Is that the life you've been dreaming of? I don't know what I want anymore. I no longer know what kind of life I really want. I drift between two worlds, I don't know where I belong. I want a home. Didn't you say we're going to have a home together? Where are you? Tell me where are you? I just know, I've tried my best to love you. But I'm really unhappy. You make me happy. You always make me happy. [traffic honking in distant] [siren blaring] Lenny. We can't keep destroying ourselves anymore. We can't carry on like this anymore. [music] Sorry. So he is the memory? The dream that you couldn't let go of all these years. So, what we have is, it's what? It's a lie? A game? That's not true. It's not? Don't do this? You know I want to be with you. Do you? Do you? Don't. - Do you want to be with me? - Yes. I love you. Is that what you want to hear? I only want to hear it if it's the truth. But I don't think you know how to love someone because you've never lost someone you loved. Don't do that to me! - Don't do what? - Don't! [siren blaring] [taking deep breaths] [cars honking] [siren blaring] [music] [Lenny] When you've finally found the person you've been looking for the whole of your life. You've realized you still love her deeply. This kind of love is like having a family, a best friend and a lover all in one. The beautiful thing is, it's an eternal love. The scariest thing is, it's beyond any control.
