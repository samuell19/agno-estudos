FAUBOURG SAINT MARTIN Do you hear that? Of course, it's the waterfall. No, it sounds as if someone is walking behind us. Who could it be? Let's get out of here, this isn't a place for you. With all those weird people. Don't worry about me. They're nice people. What do you mean? Night prowlers. They won't hurt anyone. You shouldn't be seen with me. Go, now. Take a right, onto the walkway, next to the guards house, the gate will open. Go, get out of here. Where were you? Think I didn't see you? What have I done to you? I don't want to see you anymore. It's over. Understand? Come back. - Never. Don't you like being with me? - No, I don't. You didn't use to say that. I don't owe you anything. Just stop it, you disgust me. Flowers, Miss? Smile, life's beautiful! Here, this is for you. Good night. Miss. - Don't worry, I have my key. Are you the new night watchman? I work three nights a week. Don't you sleep, like the others? It's quiet, I can study here. Vocational training. Yes... that's nice. Here, for the night. Good night. Good night. What's going on? - Nothing serious. The Marquise asked for a cab. Why does she need a cab? - Today's Wednesday. That's right. I can't stay another night. This place is hell. Francois... get the bill ready for... Room 43. But it was booked until Friday. - Doesn't matter. It could have been worse, you know. Not to mention the water leak in the sink. Thanks for telling us. It's fixed now. For the next customer, of course. The taxi is waiting. - Make him wait another few minutes. They close the taps so tight, no wonder. I'm going to the museum. What's going on? Nothing. What did you say? I'm going to the museum with Pierre for his birthday. Rodin or Grévin? It's his birthday? Take him to the Louvre. But of course. And that leaking tap is so exasperating. So exasperating. Don't you like the sound of water falling, sir? Imagine a pierced gutter when it rains. Wouldn't that noise, so beautiful, put you to sleep? I've never seen you like this, Mrs. Coppercage. He bugs me! Fine, but I must hurry. Offices will open soon. Suzanne, you should go see Marie. She's not well. Still in love? The madman wants his property back. When I say mad, I mean weak, pathetic. Yet, he likes quick solutions, so he must be dangerous. When she came home last night, she looked terrible. It was impossible to comfort her. You, unbreakable like you are? Unbreakable? That's what you think. Sometimes... Could you explain some things? I'm new here. You want to know the secrets? Yes, the secrets. I like that girl. Which one? - The short brunette in pants. That's Suzanne. What does "open the office" mean? You're right, she doesn't look like a cleaning lady. Take a guess. Her passion is singing. - Singing? Not pop or rock music, real singing. Classical singing. She has a beautiful voice. Three times a week, a former famous opera singer gives her lessons. And the diva's not for giving gifts. She's expensive. OK, but earlier I heard her say: "I must hurry before the offices open". She's got to make a living. So every morning, early, she gets busy before the offices open. Some guys like to do it early, you know. I never thought... You see? - I see. She doesn't really look the part. These things happen discreetly. Thank goodness. Michelle, the one we call the Marquise, she has other fields of expertise. She's a late sleeper, so her thing is lunch time. Lunch time? So as not to waste time, they eat a sandwich and use that time to... But if I understand correctly, Marie... You understand. Though it's a bit different with her. But you understand. Mrs. Coppercage closes her eyes? Mrs. Coppercage. Her husband was British. Of course, she closes her eyes. The customers don't notice? How? You hadn't noticed anything. You're right. Gossip time? - Hi, Munchkin. Marie won't have anything this morning. - You either? After all, you're right. Thanks. A glass of water, please. You have to make a decision. It's the only way to end it. How you say that. You can't be afraid forever. Tell everything to Paul: "That's the way things are." Are you crazy? You're crazy. Then he's just a toy for you. - Please. If he means that much to you, you can't hide forever. And always be afraid he'll find out. Of course. The other side of the coin. Can't you see I'm losing him with your need for clarity? Of course I see that. What do you think? The ordeal by fire. That's how you'll know. If you truly mean something to him, the truth won't scare him. If not, he'll run like a madman. But he's important to me. He's important to me. No one's ever been that important to me. You can't know how his mere presence, his smile... For the first time, there's light. If I were to lose him, I don't know if I could go on living. I know. But what has to go away, goes away. No need to give in to despair. Life goes on. You can't forever rely on life's gifts. When you lose something, it comes back to you. Even more beautiful. Different. It's stupid. - No, it's not. How's Pierre? - Fine. Raphaelle and Gabrielle from the pharmacy were talking about him. They'd like to see him more often. He'll be here during the holidays. Remember when he started school, he'd say: "I'll go to school, but I don't know what for". - How he's changed. Thank God. - And the family? I'm a grandmother. My daughter just had a son. And Jean-Charles, still married to videos? It's a profitable business. He just received an award at the Tokyo Festival. There were 1330 candidates. He did well. I thought about you today, Mr. Duplat. - That's nice. You love art, guess where I took my grandson today? Tell me. To the Louvre. Everyone has to see it at least once. I agree, but it's so serious. It's like a church in there. What I like is the Place du Tertre. When I go there on Monday afternoons, I can say I've had a great day. Of course, being a boarder, the son of such a private business... And Mrs. Duplat? Two more weeks of treatment. Her liver has always been so fragile. Is everything alright? - Everything is perfect. My daughter loves music, she's enchanted to have a singer next door. It doesn't bother you? - Not at all. Her voice is appeasing, like an unexpected revelation of happiness. How beautifully said. It helps me appreciate Paris a bit. Mom! - I know. We're here for the kids. They see things differently. They only see what's beautiful. I only notice the confusion, the polluted air and the people's indifference. Have a nice walk anyway. The Mona Lisa is magnificent. Yes, but she knows it. He really liked it? Especially the St. Catherine de Medicis frescos. You can't miss them. - Rubens liked large paintings. We took pamphlets back for school. - Still first of his class? You should hear his recitations: "My father, man of benignant..." - Hero. "My father, hero of benignant mien, on horseback visited the gory scene, after the battle as the evening fell... and took with him a trooper loved right well, because of bravery and presence bold." You mean they still teach them that? Victor Hugo is eternal. - Alas! That's funny. Of course it's funny. I meant to be funny. My God! The night watchman is ill. Call his replacement. Don't forget about the physicists. I'll help. Many clients are leaving today. Why are people leaving? Because of the railroad strike. Well, let them go, then. We'd like a room for two, please. With single beds... - With a double bed. No problem. Room 58. For how long? Two nights. - Perfect. Thank you. How shameful, scandalous! MY key, please. I've never seen anything like it. What's going on? He's shocked that I gave a room with a double bed to two men. Know what I mean? I've never seen anything like it. And I'm 71 years old, Madame. And that's all life's taught you? I like your robe. It reminds me of the hummingbirds and the flamboyant tree... from your country, I know. Soon, I'll know the place without ever having been there. I didn't know my stories bothered you. Idiot! Guadeloupe is shaped like a butterfly resting on the water whose body is the salted river and the wings, the Basse Terre and the Grande Terre. You see, I listen when I want to. You're right, you don't pretend. You're not going this year? Maybe earlier than planned, but for good this time. Aren't you well here? I'm fine when I'm with you. That's nice of you to say. It's not the same. This isn't my home. I miss too many things. - What things? Simple things, like those with which I was born. Like the night. It falls all at once. You don't have time to notice it. It's unique. Suddenly, the air is filled with sounds of frogs and crickets. The night just crawls up on you. The effect it has on you is incredible. That's funny. What's funny? What you're saying. That's not what people usually miss. All of a sudden, without noticing it, the night is here. I'm talking about what I'll rediscover. I'll miss other things because they no longer exist even for those who never left. Such as? Such as... Boats, large liners all lit up by the sun at nightfall. We used to go see them leave the harbor as a family. The Colomb, the Hirpinia, the Flandres, the Antilles... I'll tell you about the hurricanes one day. What about the secret of your silhouette? I thank God for saving me. You lose strength here, you gain weight, your hair falls and your sight regresses. You need glasses. Don't you think black men look ridiculous in glasses? Please, tell me about the hurricanes. A few minutes before its arrival, the sky changes colour. Birds disappear, insects are silent, the sea rumbles more and more, over there near the Gates of Hell, in the Devil's Hole, the waves are swallowed up. I just came by. - Did you see Suzanne? So you know everything. - If you say so. I've made a decision. - Good for you. Are you going out? - Guess what. May I come along? You just came in. - You know me... Walk with me to the boulevard. You're really confused, aren't you? I can assure you that I feel it. Listen, to suffer is above all something to do. You're completely wrong. I'm tired. You don't understand. I know about love, I've had my share. Besides the brief and confined moments of pleasure, it's not something I'd want to build. No way, I'm over that. You have a son. It's different. Anyway, you never much worried about the future. The future does not exist. It doesn't mean anything. What poisons our existence is our obsession with tomorrow. In ten years, in twenty years... I laugh at those who are so afraid of being alone. People get married, hate each other, just so as not to be alone. Someone always leaves first. I don't see things that way. If you knew Paul. You're right in a way, but I only see him now. It's so new, you know, so different from my past. I saw my first ray of sunshine here. When I push the door of the Hotel and see Mrs. Coppercage it's as if I were in Heaven. You know where I come from. You've always been different, free, independent. You don't know about police raids, women rivalries, filthy furnished flats with loose doors, cold water, spring flower sprays after each visit. I know. To each his burden. When Paul arrived, everything changed. It's as if... I can't find the words. - Don't say anything. Remember what Mrs. Coppercage told us one night? The worst thing in a woman's life is her first man. I hadn't understood then. The worst also meant the best. We forget the others, but not the first one. I want the best life possible, too bad for the worst parts. I'm going away with him for a few days. Will you tell him everything? Everything. Good luck! I think we've met before. I don't think so. I didn't know you two minutes ago. Now we know each other. You knew nothing about me, you stared at me, I was alone. There are two of us now. Where are you coming from? - The office. So late? - I'm an apprentice tiler. And I have a night job to pay the bills. I do that too, you know. I wouldn't have minded another hour with you. Don't worry, it's on me tonight. You live around here? No, that way. - Let's go. You don't look so great tonight. With all that happened today. Restlessness and melancholy. Fear for your projects? My projects... You couldn't be more right. I'll have another good and strong one. MY Projects. Aren't you a bit of a magician? Or a sorcerer? MY Projects... Today, people no longer live out their passions, create great memories, whatever could be great. Just the legal minimum. That's what we're living. Have you drowned your tears? Hippocrates prescribed drunkenness once a month to fight depression. Other than that, I don't submit myself to any extravagances. That instinct of preservation confines to pettiness. Since you seem to be in that frame of mind, I'll talk about you. You smoke too much, it's bad for your voice. My Voice! You must be dreaming, dear Mrs. Coppercage. Dreaming. Between dream and reality, there's enough to lose patience and use up courage. Tu che le vanité conoscesti del rnondo... It's not so bad. So my voice won't lead me anywhere. I'll open a fitness center, for women only. I've always wanted my own place where I'd make women who don't care about their physique, but rather about imaginary illnesses, work their bodies. Listen to you. What a change that'll be. Still about breathing and diaphragm. The lift has been broken since 8. I don't want to know. Do as you please, I've had enough. Really, you really like it? If you'd only known the place before. I came here with my mother, so carefree. Only later did problems arise. You came here on holidays? - We couldn't afford it. There was a travel plan from Paris to the seaside. I don't know if it still exists. My mother sometimes bought it. I loved the cabins that protected us from the wind. They reminded me of Abdel Kader's tribe from school books. There was a pool painted blue, built by the British late last century. They're going to replace it with a modern complex. Right. What's wrong? I don't know. - Marie. I wanted to tell you... - Don't say anything. Don't be sad. Aren't you well here? Seize the moment. I'm imagining you and your mother, a little girl in the sand. You spoke of Sundays as if they were unforgettable. I have no memory of the past. I think I had a happy childhood, a permanently happy childhood. Suzanne would be sensible now. - Who? A friend. I'll introduce you one day. I do remember something. I must have been 3 or 4 years old, we lived in Savoie. You're not Parisian? - Not me, but my parents are. They met in lvry after the war. My mother's health was bad. The doctor recommended the countryside. My father left everything for her and got a new job at the National Forestry Commission. That's how I was born in Savoie, in a small village of Tarentaise. One day, I put a bean up my nose. Couldn't get it out. It was stuck in the nasal septum. My dad had to take me to the district doctor. It was a horrible winter. Do you know what he did? He put me in his backpack and carried me down to the valley. What I remember is that he had put a small stool in his backpack so that I'd be comfortable during the trip. My head was the only thing sticking out. We traveled miles into the forest and the snow. All the way to town. Should we go back to the hotel? - Already? Please. You're so mysterious. How old are you? What do you do? Tell me what you like. Why do we ask all those questions? You really want to know? - No. Attention platform 2, track 2! The train for Paris is ready for departure. This train will stop a! Hans du Filliers, Rue, Abbeville, Amiens, Creil... Next time we'll go to Belgium. You'll see how beautiful Bruges is. I can have a week off work. We could even go to Holland. I have an idea: let's take a taxi back to my place. I'll introduce you to my family. - Not tonight. Then I'll take you back to the hotel. I talked about you. They want to meet you. You're almost family. Don't ask. Be sweet, leave me. Please... go. Go away. What are you waiting for? She's yours, for free, even. Don't ruin her face, she could still be useful. You may take this plate. Marie won't be coming anymore. - I'm afraid not. It's time for bed. - Mom, you promised. I kept my promise. You may sleep here. Did you learn your lessons? You know that we have a recitation. Let's see, give me your notebook. I'll finish my drawing first. For whom? - Suzanne. Why not make him use his right hand? - We shouldn't try to change that. Indeed. Are there many left-handers in your school? More and more. When he was 3 or 4, he asked Santa for one thing: well-sharpened colour crayons. Marsupilami holding on to a branch, so tightly! For Suzanne, October 21, 1985, 11:20:30 PM. You are going to bed. No recitation, then? Hurry up and then off to bed. To be a man... If you can keep your head when all around you Are losing theirs blaming I! on you; If you can trust yourself in doubt Bu! make allowance for doubting; If you can wait and no! be tired of waiting... Or, being lied about, don'! deal in lies Or, being lied about, don't deaf in fies Or being hated don't give way to hating, And ye! don'! look too good, no! talk too wise; If you can force your heart and nerve To serve your turn after they are gone; And so hold on when there is nothing Except the Will which says: “Hold on!“ If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue... Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch, Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch... if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, bu! none too much, Yours is the Earth and everything in it, And you will be a Man, my son. Kipling. Bravo! - That was great. Off to bed. Good night, honey. Your son is wonderful. His father was astonishing. The type of man you rarely meet these days. He was... simple. A stranger to all the restrictions life teaches us. He was there, we were fine. He reassured us in silence just by his mere presence. Hard to explain how... - You are describing grace, my dear. After his fatal accident, it was horrible. Pierre was so young. I felt so lost. So I seized the first opportunity. You had plenty, I imagine. He was a solid man, somewhat vain... He had a nice situation. Pierre and my future were safe. He considered him his son right away. One day, I woke up and looked at things straight on. I felt handicapped, destroyed, almost dead. Things were set once and for all. We were to spend time together, go through everyday life, everyday movements... I wondered howl had found the energy to blow everything up. I had dreamed of so many other things, other roads... If you can be hated don'! give way to hating... Don't be afraid, Miss. Why is this closet open? I don't know. - And this? I'm not in charge of linens. - Who is? Marianne, I think. - Where is Marianne? On the second floor. - She always leaves a trace. Have you seen Suzanne? - Not this morning. What's going on? Everyone seems nervous today. She'll get burned with her clear situations. None of my business. You prefer complicated situations? Depends, nothing's not that simple. Here, everything is a mystery... - Secrets. There are secrets? - Everywhere, but don't worry. Marianne, we always have to finish your work for you. Just because you're young, you think the world is at your feet. You'll learn that you're the one sewing others. So get ready for it. The discovery can be a harsh one. Take the chair out of the hallway, take out the linens and close the closet. Well, Marc... You know Suzanne? - No... Yes, why? She came by earlier. You must go see Marie. Here's the address. Can you keep a secret? - Yes. I have to tell you something tonight. But not a word to mom, OK? Shall I drive you? No, I have to go to the Forum first. Listen to the world, it could be useful. Are you OK? - Not at all. What's wrong? She had another fit. I gave her her medications. She waited for you and then left. Where did she go? Who knows? She was hopping mad. - Hopping? It's as if she carried the devil in her. Miss Garnier, please. - Ask that young man. Marie Garnier, please. She won't see anyone. Suzanne came to get you? - Yes. She should be back shortly. Would you like to sit down? - Francois. I know about you. You're not one to listen to rumors. Marie doesn't know you are here. Someone did come to get me. I wasn't dreaming. A decision Suzanne made. One of those extreme decisions. Not her style though. Marie means a lot to you, doesn't she? And if I'm not completely off, please correct me if I'm wrong, I understand that you don't know much about her. I met Marie three months ago. As of that day, my life's changed. Everything I know began on that day. What else is there? Not to mention that if sometimes the truth poisons our existence, sometimes lies help it a little, right? You're a nice guy, you know that? I thank Marie for not harassing me with questions. You know, the ones women usually ask. The hunting agenda. Never and yet... I believe you. This time it's different. I don't know what happened. You know what happens between two people. That wonderful chemistry. Before her, things were fine. But it wasn't perfect. Whereas now... Perhaps we learn with each new meeting. Indeed, we learn this like everything else. It's a first each time, we learn something each time. Few people know that, you know. And sometimes we make mistakes. It's a beautiful risk to take. I've never talked to her about this. Yet, I confide in you as if I'd always known you. Marie won't see anyone. But you're so welcoming. Yet, I feel as if she's here, so close. Help me. You must give her some time. She'll be better tomorrow. You'll see her. We're alike, you and me. We're of the same family. We have a tendency to get close. Go on, now. The Marquise looks crossed today. You call her that 'cause she looks like a duchess? No, otherwise, you think she'd look like our Marquise? You have a point. You've got nothing to complain about. When she arrived with her son, she had a small dog. That dog never left her side. She was run over by a car. Her name was Marquise. It stayed with her. Lovely. Leaving already? - For the closing of offices. We should break up. Marie. - Break up and not see each other. What's happening? - I'm scared. What are you scared of? If something happened to you, I'd be responsible. Responsible. You're talking weird. Responsible. You're looking for reasons to leave me. It's not that, please. I don't deserve your trust. I'm not who you think I am. If you knew... If I knew what? There were so many before you. - I know, I know. And you still see me? I do and I will. I have nothing to hold against you. You lived before meeting me, you smiled at others before me, so? I have nothing against that. You understand? No, I don't understand. You're scaring me all of a sudden. Don't be afraid. How can I say this? When I know I'm going to see you, life is easier. It's like a hill we descend calmly, carefree. That's howl feel. I don't want to own you. No one owns anyone. You're free Marie, if you want. I don't want to alter that freedom. I love you. That's no reason to imprison you. Let me hold on to you in secret. Let me dream a little longer. Like today, on my way to meeting you, I dreamed of asking you to share your life with me, by simply becoming my wife. Paul. She's beautiful. So is he, the perfect husband. - No, a man. It is not necessarily the same thing. She won't be able to hold him back with a leash. Regrets? I'm no longer the marrying type. But, since Mr. Coppercage's passing, you could have remarried. I couldn't share my life with another. I shared it once and for all. As someone I knew used to say: we only live once and if we do well, it's quite enough. Is your mother here? - No, she's at the store on Saturdays. Besides, she doesn't like ceremonies. Some people are like that. Me and weddings! It's Soul Sunday. How beautiful. Did you hear that, Marquise? I saw so many leave They only asked for fire They didn't need more They knew so little anger I hear their step I hear their voice Saying trivial things As those written in the journal As those told a! home a! nigh! What has been done to you man-woman Tender eyelids all used up And your broken appearances Looking a! you breaks my soul Things go as they go Sometimes the earth trembles Sadness seems like sadness Deep, deep, deep You'd like to believe in the blue sky I know the feeling Sometimes I believe I! too Like the lark in the mirror I admit I believe sometimes Such that I can'! believe my ears lam so like you lam so like you Like you, grains of sand Like the blood always shed Like the fingers always injured I am like you So much I would have liked to help you... Cry, Marie, cry. Don't listen to anyone, anything. Listen to your tears. Submit yourself to your suffering, until it's become unbearable, impossible. It's the only way to end it all. I know it. It's the only way to understand and admit that Paul has left. He's gone, Marie, Paul, his eyes, his smile, his hands, his breath, are no longer here. SO CW! Without modesty, without shame, without restraint. Don't ever stop being yourself, as he wanted you. As he wants you, as he wants you. Thank you. - Goodbye, Sir. I interrogated all the witnesses and a few of your employees. I understand. The coroner is certain: the bullet hit the center of the heart, causing a hemorrhage. According to all the statements, the shooter had never been seen at the hotel. You, did you know him? Miss Garnier had introduced him when she moved here. She wanted to end their relationship. Something strikes me though. This type of man usually doesn't come to places like these. The report is clear: your hotel is above all suspicions. Have you ever taken a risk, inspector? I tried as well as I could to help this young woman. With the legal means adapted to my situation. My establishment is a refuge, sir, not a cover if that's what you mean. Of course, this wedding alone shows... my innocence. I appreciate your delicate hesitation. Please forgive me, the saying is unfortunate. I agree. I'm going to... tell you something. I think we're close. Interesting. Neither one of us has the calling. You manage a hotel. The inspector looks for leads. Not by vocation. No, explain yourself. By curiosity. By compassion probably, maybe just by the need of others. We agree then. But we haven't chosen the easier path. You're telling me. Look at the living creatures on this earth: bees have a small cerebral ganglion allowing them to solve their bee problems. Eels always reach the Sargasso Sea. All living creatures do what must be done to preserve the world in balance or it would collapse. All living creatures, inspector, all, except one. Who destroys, devastates... Terrorizes, kills... It's for you. A simple case of jealousy. OK, see you later. I may have simplified things but sometimes, nuances are superfluous. They only complicate things. My respects, Madam. Make me some coffee. - With two ice cubes? You're quick. The Marquise and Suzanne are leaving. I know. We'll miss them. You're right about that. Tell the reception not to accept anymore customers and guests that they need to go. I'm closing down. Must you close down? - Not really. Sometimes, one has to know the time has come to close the door and pull the curtain. So, I'm closing down. For now. - I understand. Where are the Marquise and Suzanne? At the reception, next to the luggage room. Don't worry, I know things will work out for you. Thank you, for everything. I like you a lot, Francois. I'll miss you a whole lot. - Come on, now. It's silly, but I'll say it anyway. I like your laugh, I love your smile. MY Word! Your smile bears dreams and all that we can't explain. Never ironic or mean... It hides nothing... and is full of spontaneous and wonderful things. You're telling me this now? Life is stupid sometimes. - Don't think that, Francois. Life probably holds a secret we don't know. We have to live with that. I don't remember where or when someone said: We come from the wind, we return to the wind. Nice, isn't it? Why should we be unhappy? For now, it's better this way. Don't you worry. We forget things quickly these days. Take care of her. Will do. I'm scared this time. She has to live, not die. It won't be easy. - I know. I know, but women have resources... So, beautiful... don't change. Don't ever change. And you, work and stick at it. Keep on believing and remember what I told you. Never quit. There. Francois... their luggage!
