What will you do, Vivien, in your new home? Well, I'll look up at the moon, right beside you. Because when I get chosen I'll tell them I'm not going unless you take Sophia, too. Don't you ever worry that you won't get a good family? Are you kidding? I'll be the first girl chosen. ♪ My baby kissed me good night ♪ And I'm glad to relate ♪ By the time I got home ♪ I was feeling great ♪ I climbed up the door And opened the stairs ♪ Said my pajamas And put... Hey! My jar. Viv! Viv! Get up, Vee! You'll miss your spot. My jar. Can you see it? Vivien, it's your turn! It's your turn! ♪ ...Shined up an egg ♪ Then I toasted the news I'm here. I'm right here! I'm clean! I'm clean! Look at me! Look at me! Sophia, tell them! Don't let them hurt me. Cynthia, tell them it was a mistake. Sophia, tell them I did it right. Vee... It's a mistake! I'm clean! I'm clean! No, please. I'm clean. Tell them I did it right. Please! Sophia! I'm clean! I'm clean! Don't take me! A clean girl is always attentive and dutiful. A clean girl embraces... Obedience. A clean girl is always humble and patient. A clean girl embodies... Sweetness! A clean girl is always fit and temperate. A clean girl... Vivien... should we report it? Does this mean that class is over? Maybe we should go back to our rooms or... We wait for the buzzer, Greta. All of us. ...Honest and forthcoming. A clean girl gives the school... Loyalty! Very good, girls. Now, please prepare yourself for a short lecture. - Good night. - Good night. Vivien? Yes? You have to watch Greta. She's always asking questions. Go to sleep, Ava. Sleep well. Assembly. Good morning, girls. Good morning, Miss Brixil! I have good news. As of today, you have completed Level 15. And now you will all be moving up to Level 16. Level 16 will be your final year at Vestalis. You will soon be meeting your new families. So remember your lessons. Embrace the feminine virtues that we have taught you and... Eyes down! Now, I will give you your new hall assignments. Beginning with Rose Hall. The following girls will now move up to Rose Hall: Rita. Ava. Vivien. Well, here we are. Big beds! We get our own beds. New arrivals. Hi. I'm Clara. You're Vivien, right? I'm Hedy. We were both in Lily Hall on Level 14. I'm Ava. This is Rita and Vivien. Viv? I want the last bed in the first row. Each hall has its top girl and in this hall it's me. Obedience. Cleanliness. Patience. Humility. No questions and no complaining. Hmm? Vitamins are necessary for healthy, growing bodies. Vitamins prevent disease. Take your vitamin now. Vitamins are necessary for healthy, growing bodies. Vitamins prevent disease. Take your vitamin now. Vitamins are necessary for healthy, growing bodies... Is something wrong? No. Mmm. Cabbage day. You knew that girl? Sophia? There's something weird about her. She squints. She has bad eyesight. This is ridiculous. It's worse than Level 15! Anger is the second vice, Clara. - I'm not angry. - You sound angry to me. Does she sound angry to you, Vivien? I'm going to the water closet. Cripes! I need to talk to you. Go back to Meal Break. Please. Get out of my way. No, I... I know what you're thinking. That on Level 10 I... Don't ever! If you tell anyone that I'm unclean... I wouldn't! I just... I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry. I never should've... Assembly. Good day, girls. Good morning, Miss Brixil! Level 16 is not like the other levels. All your training has led up to this moment. Soon, our sponsors will arrive to choose their new adopted daughters. But before you meet them, you will need to learn a few things. For example, how to dress like the daughter of a top society family. Grace. This one is for you. You can look at me. - For me? - Yes. Yes, come get it! What does it say? It spells "Grace". There's one here for each of you. But listen carefully. The dresses are to be hung by your beds this evening. Let them air out. We don't want wrinkles, do we? You can wear them all day tomorrow. And for a special treat, you can also wear them to bed tomorrow evening. Consider this a reward... for virtuous behavior. Vvv... Vviv... Viv... Have you ever seen anything so spiffy? It looks just like the ladies from Moving Picture Night. When I'm adopted, I'll wear swell dresses all the time. And we can go outside where the air is clean and we can look at the moon. - Good night. - Good night. Good night, Vivien. Good night, Ava. I bet you'll get the best placement. I bet you'll get a great family who will love you. Sleep well. But what if we meet the families and we don't get chosen? Don't be silly, Clara. They'll choose you right away. You're the prettiest girl in Rose Hall. Audrey, can we switch chores? I'm sweeping the classroom. Are you kidding? Yes! Thanks. - Viv. - You volunteered for wash duty. So wash. You asked me not to tell and... I... I won't. I never would. But I need you to keep a secret, too. - I don't want any trouble. - No. Listen. I'm going to tell you something and I need you to promise me that I could really, truly trust you. Obedience. Cleanliness... I need you to listen to me! I follow the rules! And soon I will be chosen, so... Don't take the vitamins. At Meal Break, do not take the vitamins. You'll have to pretend that you're... Vivien? I need help changing the sheets. Sure. Yeah, I'll... I'll be right there. Or you could come now. Sure. What's wrong with her? Nothing. Maybe she's unclean? Don't ever say that. No, I didn't mean... Is that why you always follow me around? To spy on me? No! I'm trying to help you. I don't need your help. I'm not your friend, Ava. There are no friends in this place. Vitamins are necessary for healthy growing bodies. Vitamins prevent disease. Take your vitamin now. Vitamins are necessary for healthy growing bodies. Vitamins prevent disease. Take your vitamin now. They're blue today. Vitamins are necessary for healthy growing bodies. Vitamins prevent disease. Take your vitamin now. Vitamins are necessary for healthy growing bodies. Vitamins prevent disease. Take your vitamin now. Good night, Ava. Ava? Ava! She won't wake up. They never wake up. It's the vitamins. It keeps them asleep. The vitamins keep us healthy! They protect us from unclean air and dirty water. If the door opens, pretend you're in deep sleep. - But if the guard comes... - The guards? The... No, the guards aren't allowed in here. If you need help, call out. Or if I need help... Cripes! They're coming! This one. And this one. Viv? Olivia? And here we are. These are the two you asked to see... Olivia. She has a fresh look like a breath of clean country air. The very picture of youth. She is lovely. And this is Vivien. Classic, delicate features. Skin like rich cream. One in a million. Exquisite. Isn't she, dear? Would you like a glass of champagne? Champagne, dear? Yeah. Yes, please. So perfect. Imagine, never damaged by a single ray of sunlight. If you believe that. You said you wanted this. Why risk coming here if you aren't... It's my choice. Yes, of course. But we've come all this way... I'm not interrupting, I hope... Mr. Denison? If you want to see other options... No. We'll buy that one. Pay them. Haggle, if you wish, but I'm going back to the hotel. I think we've made our selection. Wonderful. Let me show you to the office. This one. They're waiting for her! I don't think they locked it. I didn't hear it lock! Are you okay? The sponsors. They don't want to adopt us. They... they want to buy us. This is our only chance. Brixil will be back soon... I... I followed all the rules. - We have to go. - Go where? - Outside. - You're crazy! The is air is poisonous outside. We can't. You don't understand what's been happening. No. No. No, no... This one. I'm here. No, I'm almost done with Rose Hall. A little bit of hand-holding but no more than usual. Just one problem. Alex, I know. But I don't want him on the floors unsupervised. I can't talk now. I want to stay here until we finish Rose Hall. There's just one girl left. I'll come down before we open Lily Hall. Yes. Okay. It's locked now. That was our only chance. When did you stop... with the vitamins? Level 13. You're lucky. - If any other girl had seen... - I haven't told anyone else. Well, that's... good. Just keep your head down. - They're drugging us. - It's wrong, I know! - Maybe there is a reason... - You're defending them, after what they did to you? What "they" did to me? Vivien. Please enter. Good morning, young lady. "Vitamins are necessary for healthy growing bodies. Vitamins prevent disease." Please have a seat. I didn't think you were real. I mean, I thought you were just a voice. My name is Doctor Miro. I only deal with the senior students. They need special attention. Vivien is a lovely name. One of my favorite actresses is named Vivien. - Really? - Just breathe normally. Okay. And out. Again in. And out. Good. I'm afraid there's been an outbreak of fever in one of the other halls. Now, it's nothing to worry about but I will be giving all the students a series of vaccines, just to be safe. Do you understand? Okay. Roll up your sleeve, please. There we go. Okay, a little pain. There we are. And not a peep from my brave patient. Now, Vivien, do you have any skin problems, dry spots, pimples? No. Never. That's what I like to hear. But um, sometimes there's... Yes? Oh, it's nothing. All the girls get... Go on. Uh, sleep scabs? Sleep scabs. Can you show me? One moment. It's not that bad. If you just wash it with soap in the shower, it normally just gets better. When we get adopted our beds are going to be really soft and we won't get the sleep scabs anymore, that's what all the girls say. Well, you were right about the soap. Make sure you use a lot of soap on these sores. And you tell all the other girls. Remember, cleanliness is...? The second virtue. Correct. That should help speed up the healing and help with the pain. Thank you. Now, Vivien, we care about you. The academy is your family. You can go now. Grace. Please enter. Good morning, young lady. Hi, Vivien. Hi, Rita. - Is that the... - It's the Vitamin Doctor. Geez, and I thought this day couldn't get any better. And why is today so great? Hello? It's day 3. Yes? It's Moving Picture night. Hello. Hello. You live here? Used to. Who runs this place? A lady by the name of Mrs. Burke. She's not home. You waiting for her? Just came back to get my things. I've been away for a while. I'm waiting for a taxi. I used to live here in this house, seventeen, eighteen years ago. Was born here. Don't kid me. You're older than that. Well, I didn't move right after I was born... Why the blue pills? These white ones make us sleep. But the blue ones knocked them right out. We've never had blue before. And we've never had party dresses before. Because the patrons never came to see us before. So the door's never going to be unlocked again? I've been waiting since Level 13. And they never once left it unlocked. What do you do? During the night? I fall asleep... eventually. A long time after they do. But then the doors are locked and there's nowhere to go, so... I listen. To what? The other halls. - There's four halls, right? - Right. Rose, Lily, Daisy and Iris. Everyone knows that... We all share the same floor. A hall wakes up, they go to class. Do their chores, vitamin, meal break, evening cleanse and sleep. But then there's a... a pause. A Dark Hour before the next hall wakes up. If we get out during the Dark Hour, the other girls won't see us. Even if we get into the hall, there are Big Eyes everywhere. I don't think we need to worry about the Big Eyes. They bring the guards. I walked down the hall. But I was right in front of the Big Eyes and nothing happened. No alarms? No. I got to the stairs, but the door wouldn't open. I think we need one of those shiny cards. - We should tell the other girls... - No! No way! They don't know. They take that pill every night... Have you ever been punished? Have they ever taken you downstairs? We'll find another way. Vivien. I didn't call for you. I, no. I just... I need to talk to you. Of course. Come on in. Have a seat. You have something to tell me? I like your glasses. Thank you? There's a girl in Rose Hall who has really bad eyesight. She could use some glasses. Is this what you wanted to tell me? Am I really named after a famous actress? Yes. Vivien Leigh. A famous beauty. Do I look like her? You have her smile. But then you've never seen Dark Journey or Storm in a Teacup. I wanted to put Gone With the Wind on your list, but Miss Brixil was absolutely opposed. Moving Picture Night? Oh, I choose your films. - That's because of you? - Uh-huh. - Oh. - It's one of the few perks of this position. Oh, the girls love Moving Picture Night. Especially Ava and Rita and Hedy. But not you? No, I love it, too. It... Go on. Well, we see the same, um, films? - Uh-hmm. - Films. We see them over and over again. And most of the time, the girls know all the words so... You selfish girl. You want to know what Vivien Leigh looks like, is that it? Uh, yeah. I'll see what I can do. Come on. Now, let's just keep this little chat between the two of us, shall we? I don't think Miss Brixil would approve. You're so... nice. Oh, Vivien, when a girl is obedient and sweet, the world cannot help but love her. Just follow the rules, be patient and let us take care of you. All right? Veronica? She needs water. Grace, can you go get some water? Ew. She's really sick. It's probably the Fever. We should call the guards. She hasn't done anything wrong. Well, I don't want to be infected by a sick girl... - by any unclean girl... - Can you shut your gobber, Ava! Come on. I'm going to help you get cleaned up. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm sure it's nothing. Can I see? I don't have the Fever! The doctor gave me the vaccine. I'm fine. Let me see your arm. That looks bad. It's just a vaccine. And the pills are just vitamins. We should talk to the other girls. They would never believe us. We need a plan. Um... or maybe the doctor could help us. What? Why would you trust him? I... I don't. I don't. You just stopped taking the vitamins... so you don't know what's been happening. There is this guard, - he limps when he walks... - Yeah. Yes, the one with the metal plate under his shoe? He comes into our room... during the Dark Hour. I don't... What are you saying? He comes alone. And he touches the girls. He waits until we're asleep and then he chooses the... Good grooming starts with personal care. This principally means the care of your hands, your hair, your teeth and your skin. Let's begin with the skin by taking a look at it from the doctor's point of view. You'll find that skin is a complex living tissue... No questions! Curiosity is the first vice. ♪ Will you hear a Spanish lady ♪ How she woo'd an Englishman? ♪ Garments gay, rich as may be ♪ She had on ♪ Comely was her countenance... Deep breath. And again. Very good. No sign of any fever, you're as healthy as a horse. So how was your lesson today? A very fascinating lecture about hygiene, I hear. The beautiful lady in waiting, that's Vivien Leigh, right? - You liked it? - Oh, I loved it. Yes. Yeah, very much. She... she was so, uh... strong. In the way that she walked and the way that she talked, I mean, it was just as if everyone should just... just get out of her way. And even when they were laughing at her or scowling she just held her head up. Like no one could touch her. Yes, well, Laurence Olivier had the better scenes. I have another vaccination for you today. But you said that I was healthy. Don't you use that tone with me. Sorry. Sorry, I just, um... well, the vaccines, some of the girls have been getting sick. If you have any problems in Rose Hall you can report that to Miss Brixil. Miss Brixil won't help us. She works with the guards. Vivien, have you been taking your vitamins? Yes. Of course. Because you seem upset. Are you angry? No. Anger is a vice. That's right. And the vices of the unclean lead to what? - Hysteria. - Correct. Which is a very serious risk for young women. I'm going to give you a concentrated vitamin injection. I don't need that. When a girl behaves the way you are behaving, I am required to call the guards, do you understand? To send you down for punishment. Is that what you want? Hmm? I'm not going to do that because I think you deserve a second chance. Do you deserve a second chance? Yes. What is a girl's first virtue? Obedience. Much better. This isn't punishment. I only want to help you. Viv? Hmm, you shouldn't sit with me. I'm unclean. I might infect you. There is nothing wrong with you. My head feels heavy. Your head will clear. When I first stopped taking the pills, it was like my mind was working for the first time. The days just all kind of blur together. Yeah. Yeah, that's why I started keeping a calendar. I put a line for every day on the headboard behind my bed. I've never told anyone that before. I have a plan. What kind of plan? To get out, we need a shiny card. The guards have the cards. No. - No. No! No... - Shh! The guards are animals. All they do is hurt us! - But the... - Quiet down. - The guards don't even speak like us. - Shh! Are you sure? What's the problem? I've never reported anyone before. It's our responsibility to report unclean behavior. One unclean girl could infect everyone. But is she really that bad? Because, uh, she... You want a good placement, don't you? We follow the rules, that's what good families want. If we follow the rules, we'll get good homes where we'll be safe. Hello? This is student Ava from Rose Hall on Level 16. I've witnessed unclean behavior. He hasn't done anything on this level. But he will do it again. He won't stop. He seems strong. But he comes alone. Sneaky. I don't think Brixil knows he does it. Well, then we'll wait for him. Together. We could make a rope. To tie him up. But first we'll need to... Assembly. - Come with me. - What? Come on. I haven't done anything! You'll speak when you are spoken to. Physical punishment is never my first choice. Do you understand? So consider this a test. Will you cooperate or do I need to send you downstairs? Do I need to call the guards? Spend your time here reflecting on the feminine virtues. If you show obedience and sweetness, I may let you out in the morning. Or you can stay here until graduation. Don't let this box be the last thing you see. You're in a good mood. And you are not. I'm worried about Alex. His uncle is not an easy man to deal with. I never wanted to deal with any of them. Well, they protect us and they bring us customers. They bleed us dry. They want us to restock. What? - Just listen to me... - Most of the floors are empty. We wouldn't have to use children this time. Not with the advancements I've made. We could start as old as 12, maybe older. You said just 3 more years. They want a greater return on their investment. Oh, we have cut corners year after year. This place is falling apart and we are running ourselves off our feet trying to keep it going! What do you want me to do? These are dangerous people! We should have compressed the timeline. Kept them sedated 24/7. That was never financially viable and you know that. - Maybe there's a way. - No. We'd need ventilators, nasogastric feeding, constant medical attention. We wake them for five hours a day, they clean themselves, feed themselves... If you hadn't spent so much time designing classes and writing up your little "history lessons." Well, it's worked, hasn't it? By level 10, they're completely docile. Oh, like that girl you doped on level 16? I had to lock her in the box today. That one... is unusual. Don't touch her! Oh, Viv! No! Ah! Viv? Sophia, you got out? I did. I got the shiny card. Get me out of here. Okay. Let me out, Sophia. The guards will come. And I'm covered in blood. Open the door, Sophia! Don't you leave me, Sophia! You have to trust me. Don't leave me! Not again! Don't you turn your back on me again, Sophia! Please... please... Wake up, Viv. I am awake. You have to come find me, Viv. I'm awake, really, I'm awake. It's too late. She's coming. Who's coming? Where are you? Wake up! Ow! Come with me. Go. One of your classmates has behaved abominably. She has taken something valuable and it must be returned. We have searched this girl and she does not have the item. She must have given it to one of you. Any girl who is found assisting this kind of willful disobedient behavior risks losing her placement. But if you turn yourself in now, you can still prove that you're a clean girl who embraces the feminine virtues. This is your last chance to come forward. Come forward and you will be rewarded. - No one... - Enough! William... Sophia has betrayed this school... and she has betrayed you. Never have I witnessed such coarse and unfeminine behavior, such ingratitude. We gave you a full life and this is how you repay us?! We treated you like family! Well, perhaps the time for that is over. Her. I haven't done anything. No... Today, this girl will be punished. - Please, no, no! - Tomorrow, another, the next day, another and another and another and another until the item you have taken is returned! I hope for your sake I've made myself perfectly clear. Not so fast, girls! Follow me. We're going to be extra careful about your health from now on. Open your mouth. Next. Take the pill. Lift your tongue. Do it. Don't look at me like that. Tomorrow you'll join your new family. Stay awake. Stay awake. Where is it? Where is it? Where's the card? Where's the pin? Oh, please. Oh, please... Thank you, Vee. William? No. No. No! No. No. No. No. No! No! Please! Hello? You might as well come in. Sit down. It won't hurt to sit down. You can barely stand. Because you drugged me. He said you were different. Where is Sophia? You two are friends? Tell me where she is! We change your hall assignments on each level to prevent that kind of bonding. Tell me where she is! She's downstairs. She's fine. I don't want to hurt you, any of you. I'm going to leave this place tonight... or tomorrow. First, I need to give you this vitamin. And then I will take you downstairs to see your friend. Or not. My face... Agh! No! Agh! You won't get out. Ah... Patience is a virtue. - Vee. - No! No! It's okay. It's okay. It's just me. It's okay. You came after me. Of course I did. You're my friend. Can you untie me? Oh, sorry. No, I think we're going to have to cut it. Here. Okay, turn around. Done. What is this place? Ruh... Ruh-eat... I-tuh... Rita? The Doctor took her... to be punished. He said that... He said... They killed her! We should leave... now. They cut off her face. Why would they do that? I don't know and I don't care. I just want to get out of here. If we leave, they'll kill the other girls. We can't do anything. The alarm could go off at any time. What about Olivia? And Clara? And Ava? Ava wouldn't risk her neck for either of us. Do you want all of them to end up like... like that? What can we do? There are two of us. I have to try to help them. And I have to leave. This is it. Will the air be safe? I'll take my chances. Come with me. We'll get out. We'll get help... No one's going to help us. No one is going to save us. You're half-blind. So come with me. No. I'm sorry. Here. Wait for me... as long as two meal breaks? One meal break? I'll wait, but you're making a mistake. I turned my back on a friend before. Because this place taught me, trained me, to be afraid. But I am not afraid anymore. Good morning, girls. We hope you had a restful night. As we do every morning, let us review the Seven Virtues and the Seven Vices. The Seven Virtues are obedience, cleanliness, patience, humility, purity, sweetness and modesty. The Seven Vices are curiosity, anger, sentimentality, slovenliness... A Vestalis girl is sensible, not sentimental. Sentimentality is the third vice. Sentimentality is the third vice. Well done! Excellent, um, pronunciation. Now let us contemplate the fourth vice. Let's not. Ears open, minds open. As before, you will repeat the final sentence in unison... Um... Miss Brixil sent me. You're from Iris Hall, right? - No. Lily Hall... - Oh, right. Lily Hall. That's what I meant. Your assignment, from Miss Brixil, is to wake up all the girls on this level. Why are you wearing your night gown? Uh... we were both on Level 13 together, right? - And your name is...? - May. May, right. Well, May, you are now top girl. At the Vestalis Clinic, we offer a unique approach to beauty augmentation.

No... ...cutting edge, synthetic genome therapy. Ensuring that our donor material will match your personal DNA, completely eliminating the need for unpleasant... No! Where is Miss Brixil? I promise, I'll explain but we have to hurry. We have to go. Is that... is that blood? Just listen to me, okay, and... and trust me that... Doctor Miro said that you betrayed our school. This is not a school! It's a prison. We should call the guards. That would be a bad idea. - Miss Brixil! - Miss Brixil? Quiet down. Quiet... Quiet down! This is not... a school. This isn't a prison. No. This is a farm. And they raise us here like sheep. - Miss Brixil... - The sponsors do not want to adopt us. All they care about is our skin. And they will take you downstairs and skin you like an animal. - You're lying. - Rita is dead! We found her body. They took her face. They killed her? Are they... are they going to kill us? No! The school saved us from the poisonous air outside! Ava, for once in your life just think! Tell them! I can't help you. Tell them about the dead girls. You killed Rita! I've never killed anyone. Maybe you didn't carve her up yourself... but you killed her. You killed her. How many girls have died in this place? There's nothing I can do. You can help us. It's too late. Her face. Look at her face. You're one of them. A Sponsor. I just wanted to help him. He's a brilliant man, a genius. I didn't know. I didn't know. Whose face are you wearing? Spend your time in here reflecting on the Feminine Virtues. Up here! Shh! Sophia, you take the girls outside. I will take the passcard and wake up the girls on the lower level. Ava! Go! Go! Hurry! - Viv! - No! Leave her alone! Go! You're hurt. I'm fine. - Let's go. - Okay. Come on. - We can breathe the air. - Keep moving. Oh no! Run! Go! I'm sorry. Quick. Quick. - Doctor. - How many? Girls, can you hear me? Vivien. You need to get out of there right now and let me take you back to the school. We know what you've done. Oh, my dear, you're confused. We found Rita! I just want to help you. No, you don't. - You want to kill us! - No. No, I saved you... I saved you from... from poverty. And... and parents who were more than happy to sell you. I built a home for you. You locked us up. You drugged us. You had no future, Vivien. I... I gave you food and safety and... Ignorance! Your friend is hurt. It's too late to save her, but it's not too late for you, Vivien. I can't save the other girls, but I could save you. I could help you and you could help me. How could I help you? Open the door and help me find all the other lost girls. Help me get them back to the school. Just open the door. You don't have to share the same fate as this poor girl. You're not like her. You're not like the other girls. You're wrong. I am. I am just like the other girls. Could we just find a crowbar or something? That's a solid security door. Just get something! So how much am I worth? Hmm? How much is this worth? I've invested 16 years of my life for that face. I'm not leaving without it. Vivien. Vivien, wait. No. Don't... Stop! Stop! No! Stop! No! Stop! Stop! He wants to see you. No, we... we can, uh, salvage this situation. Get moving. No, no, I can... I can fix this. You just have your people deal with the police - and I'll gather... - He doesn't wait. Not for anyone, not for you. Okay, okay. Okay. We have two more survivors here. Send the paramedics. Quickly. My friend is hurt. What happened to you? Subtitles by explosiveskull
