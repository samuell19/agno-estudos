[train whistle blows] - Cut the train, now! [gun fires] We're robbing your train, Mr. Stobridge. - That's my boy, let him-- - Dad, Dad! - Hold it right there, Mister. I'm gonna take this man's kid with me to Jubilee. - You don't worry about Stobridge. You worry about me. [groaning] - [Kid] Don't let them take me! Dad! - I just bought your boy some time. The rest is up to you. - I couldn't have drawn up a better contract myself. It's simple and direct, a million bucks or you kill the kid, that's good, Charlie. - Look, the Sheriff said that we could wire the law over there-- - If the law hadn't caught up with the McCourt gang by now, it's plain to me I can't count on them. ♪ Hello, my baby ♪ Hello, my honey ♪ Hello my good time pal - Get your hands off! - Hey, Mister! I'm trying to make a living up here, in case you haven't noticed. What are you two doing in this part of the country? - We're gamblers, ma'am. - What was driving you? A man like that, coming into country like this. Got to be a good reason. - There is. But you're gonna have to hear it from him. - Jenkins. You're coming with me. [gun fires] - You're a bounty hunter? - I don't want any trouble. - Well, you've got it. [gun fires] [glass breaks] [gun fires] - Killing follows you everywhere, don't it, baby? - You can do it. And you've got a reason, your son. - You're right. But I'm gonna need men at least as tough as McCourt's. I know where to find them, but there's gotta be something in it for them. - There's a reward out for McCourt and his men of over $100,000. - Well, where are we going now? - To look up some old friends of mine. [loud explosion] Hey, Wichita. - Brady! [horse gallops] Brady, he's pretty good. Think we could use him? - Well, he's the best I've ever seen. - You've got yourself another man. - Damn, Reece. Don't you know you can't be mean if you can't be accurate? Hey, son. When's the hanging? - Tomorrow, noon sharp. We're gonna be making history. First woman ever to be hanged in these parts. Named Kate Muldoon. - Kate? [rooster crows] [goat bleats] [horse whinnies] [lighthearted music] - It's good to see all you folks out here today. When I first came to your town, I pledged I was gonna clean it up, make it a safe place for decent folk to live and settle. For years, this territory was overrun with thieves, cutthroats, outlaws, and killers. It used to be said they owed the deed to Rawlins. - Come on, Pike, hurry up! - I just got one leg! - Come on, come on. And watch out for that cigar. - You just drive. - Well, I come from a place where folks have strong feelings and ideas about lawlessness. And I'm bringing those ideas here! This town, this territory, will become a safe place for people to live. Where kids can play in the street without worrying about being trampled on by some drunken cowboy. And where the womenfolk can go about without being molested. Where reckless gunplay will not be tolearted. - Get on with it, Sheriff! [loud commotion] - Katherine Muldoon. You are herewith sentenced to be hanged. [loud commotion] [horses galloping] [loud commotion] [explosion booms] Hey! I said hang her! [suspenseful music] - I didn't want to hang her in the first place. - Nice to see you, Kate. - Nice to see you, Billy. - Come on, ma'am. [lighthearted music] [explosion booms] [gun fires] [whistling] [gun fires] [lighthearted music] - Billy, take my horse and just make sure there's nobody following us. - You betcha. - Well, I don't know why you guys did this, but I'm sure glad you did. Thanks. - I wouldn't care if you robbed a poor box, ma'am. It would be a pure waste to hang a lady that looks like you. - Hanging a woman tends to give a town a bad name, they'll probably thank us for saving ya. - Well, I guess you best tell me what's going on. - Better let her in on it, Brady. - We heard about the four gunslingers that threw down on you back there. I figured a woman like you might just come in handy to us. - Who you going against? - Charlie McCourt. - You're playing for high stakes when you tangle with McCourt and his gang. You could lose, Brady. Hard. - There's $100,000 in it. - $40,000 on McCourt alone. - How about it. You in? - I'm in. But what I can't figure out is, why are you doing this? - [Reece] That's the same question I asked him. - Let's just say I'm doing a favor for a fella I met during the war. He rides with the Arizona Rangers now. - During the war? Who? - His name was Collins. - I don't recall him. - The reason you don't recall him is because he was on the other side. We'll be staying here again tonight, so do what you have to do. We'll pull out first thing in the morning. - Water? - Thanks. - Brady. Now I ain't gonna let you off the hook this easy. What's really going on here? - What are you talking about? - Well, I know why the rest of them are after McCourt. But why are you after him? - You know all you need to know. - Okay. You can't hurt my feelings. Served with you in the war, and I consider us friends whether you do or not. So, tell me if you want to, if you don't want to, I'll ride along with you anyway. - The truth is, Wichita, McCourt's got my son. - I didn't even know you had a son. - Me neither, 'til recently. He wrote me a letter, said he and his mom were in trouble. So I went to see if I could help out. - It's cold. - I don't care. Seems as though she's got herself hooked up with a real loser. Kid had a miserable life. She felt he should spend some time with me and get to know his father a little better. So he headed out for California. McCourt robbed the train, took Jeremiah as a hostage. - Well, why don't you want the others to know? - They don't need to know my personal business. They have their reasons for being in this. What's your reason? The money? - [laughs] Hell no. I just wanted to get out in the sunlight. I was tired of living like a mole. Besides, I like to ride with you, Brady. I never know what's gonna happen next. - No sign of him, Brady. Reckon they figure we were long gone. [laughs] - Breaks my heart, I was looking forward to some more action. You ain't gonna let things get dull around here, are ya? - Not for long. - We'll never make Painted Rock by nightfall, Charlie. - I know, we'll lay over at Owl Creek. Some of the old gang hangs out there. They'll put us up for the night. [lighthearted music] - [Brady] How many men you suppose McCourt's got traveling with him? - [Kate] Oh, about eight or 10. But a man like that could pick up others along the way. - [Brady] How long you been tracking him? - [Kate] A long time. It won't be easy. - Somehow I just can't figure you about him. How in the Lord's name did you get into this? - Well, you might say it came naturally. My father was an outlaw. He spent most of his life on the run, and he dragged us with him. - Us? - My mother and me. - Sounds like to me you learned to bounty hunt from the other side. - Well... After you've been shot at and tracked by the best, you learn to track and shoot right back. - Well, I just hope that when we run into McCourt, that you learned it well. - I did. [coyote howls] - Oh, ma'am. It's midnight, your watch. - Everything alright? - Quiet as a sleeping dog. [lighthearted music] [horse trots] - [Man] Goodnight, Charlie. - [Charlie] Goodnight, boys. [lighthearted music] [men speaking gibberish] [dramatic music] - Good evening. Look what I found carrying this. - What are you doing here, lady? What are you aiming to do with this? - Shoot a snake. - I think you was fixing to use it on me. Get over there. I'll take care of her. She see the boy? - No. - Make sure you keep him out of sight. Hi, Kate. - Hello, Charlie. - Brady! Brady! Kate's gone. - Gone? What do you mean gone? - I mean gone. Horse, gear, everything clean gone, she was supposed to wake me up for my watch. - Boy, that lady is sure full of surprises, isn't she? Why don't you get the horses, you and I will look around to see if she left any traces to which way she's headed. - Right. Pete, come on, give me your help. - What do you think her play is? - I don't know. Every time I've ever tried to figure out a woman, I wish I hadn't even tried. - Brady. If you ask me, that woman's trying to cross us and go after that bounty on her own. - Maybe. - No maybes. If it wasn't for us, she'd be dangling at the end of a rope. - You know, if even she does find McCourt, he's got a whole gang with him, and she's just a woman. - You know, with Kate, I get the distinct feeling that being just a woman is to her advantage. - Nothing personal, Charlie. But you happen to be worth $40,000 sitting in the saddle, or across it. - I gotta hand it to you, Kate. You got a lot of gall. How are you planning on getting me out of here? My men are all over the place, they'll stop you. - You know me better than to force my hand, Charlie. - Odds are you'll never make it. - Let's just say if I don't make it, neither will you. - Coffee. You open for a proposition, Kate? - What do you have in mind? - I'm worth $40,000, right? How would you like to double it? - Where are you gonna get $80,000, Charlie? - Not just 80,000, a million in cash. - Where? - Jubilee Bank, just waiting for me. - Robbery. Don't want any part of it. - No robbery. Let's just say I've got some bargaining power, guaranteed. $80,000, Kate. After Jubilee we can go anywhere we want, just you and me. - It's not part of the deal. - Alright. Take the 80,000, let it go at that. You need the money, Kate. We both know why. [melancholic music] Deal? - No harm in talking about it. - How long we fixing to be at Painted Rock? - [Charlie] Just as long as it takes them to bust Silvera out of that cracker box jailhouse in Hookup. - That can take a couple of days. - [Charlie] Yeah, it could. - You think that's smart, Charlie? I mean, with all that money just waiting for us in that Jubilee Bank. - Listen to me. We aren't going anywhere without them. Silvera's the best man I got. And I ain't riding into that town without him, so you best swallow that down because that's the way it's gonna stick. [lighthearted music] - What'd you find? - Nothing. Not a trace of her. - Sounds like she covered herself real good. - Ah, no matter. It's not Kate we're after, it's McCourt we want. Let's move it out. - What do we do with her team? - I guess just leave him here. She may be back. [lighthearted music] [water splashes] - [Man] Well, Brady, they definitely been through here. - [Brady] And it hadn't been too long ago either. - [Kate] Hello, Brady. - Well, I certainly hadn't expected to see you again, Kate. Couldn't you find McCourt? - Oh, I found him. But I couldn't get near him. There were too many of them. - Well, with $40,000 at stake, I would've at least expected you to make a try at it. - Well, that would've been committing suicide. Besides, I realized it's gonna take more than one to catch McCourt. - So you want to hook up with us again. - Well, let's just say need each other. - Let's go. - You mean her too? - Her too. - I say we don't take her. Remember, she's the one that went after that bounty money on her own. - She goes with us, Reece. - You better have a good reason. - Oh, I have a good reason. Because I said so. - You're the boss. - Anybody else want to change their mind? - Still $100,000 running around loose out there, boys. - Brady. Thanks for not running me off, I appreciate it. - That was a stupid thing you did. Don't ever try that again. - What was that, Brady? Does it mean something? - Yeah, it was a watch fob I gave my son on the train. - You know, I just don't think it's a good idea bringing her along. It ain't only Reece, the rest of us don't trust her either. - No, I think Brady's playing that real smart. At least if she's with us, we know where she is. [guns firing] [screaming] [cackling] [guns firing] - [Man] Hey, watch that old lamp! [laughing] - Hey, that's my gun. - You boys seem to have gotten yourself a bit roostered. - Hey, you see that? He snatched that gun out of my hand quicker than snake's tongue, by golly. - I'm afraid I'm gon have to take your gun too, cowboy. - Yeah, help yourself. - Well, I certainly appreciate that, I wouldn't want to have any trouble. - Trouble? - Now why don't you boys come with me, I've got a nice little place for you to stay tonight. - Ain't gonna be no trouble, Sheriff. We're just good timing passing through cowboys. [laughing] - Hey, you know, Sheriff, I really appreciate what you're doing because you know, - I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take your gun, Sheriff. - Now boys, take it easy now, take it easy. - [Cowboy] You too now, easy. Alright. Break Silvera out. Take care of the Sheriff. - Come on! - Woo, woo boy, woo. - Amigo, you are a sight for sore eyes. - Hey, Silvera. Where's the kid's father? - Brady Hawkes? - Yeah. - He's right behind Charlie, that's where he is. And pretty soon we'll be right behind Hawkes. - Silvera, Carson, mount up! Come on. [guns firing] - Gonna be a few minutes before we pull out. So hold up, Brady. - Masket's got a loose shoe in his horse. - Well, that's his problem. Why you letting it slow the rest of us down? I say we ride on. - Do what you're told, Reece. I'm the one who brought you into this. - That makes you the one that gives the orders. - That's right. - Just like in the army, right Brady? - Mr. Montana. - Whoa. - Are you spying on me? - No, no, I'm sorry, ma'am. I just wanted to see if you were alright. - Well, you know, there are times when a woman needs to be alone. - Oh yeah. [chuckles] Yeah, sure, sure. I understand. Oh. [whimsical music] [train engine chugs] - What are we stopping here for? - What is this place, Mr. Stobridge? - I thought we were going to San Francisco, Mr. Stobridge. You promised. - Now, now, now, ladies. Don't you fret your pretty little head. We'll get there. A little business to attend to first. Pettibone? Well, where is he? - The wire said he'd meet us here. - Strange place for a business meeting. What'd you say his name was again? - Hatch. There he is. - [Stobridge] Where's he going? - I don't know. - Alright, let's find out. - Yes sir. - Hatch! Hatch? Mr. Hatch, are you here? - [Hatch] I'm here. - Ah, Mr. Hatch? I'm Arthur Stobridge. This is Pettibone, my administrative assistant. Mr. Hatch, if you don't mind, I'd like to get right down to business. You're aware of what your duties are to be. It's really just a matter of discussing a fee. You do have a usual fee? - $20,000. - 20... Well. You're very expensive, Mr. Hatch. - Yes sir, I am. - I've made inquiries, he comes highly recommended. - Highly recommended. What does that mean? - It means I'm still alive. - Well, I do love to hear success stories, Mr. Hatch. But I'm afraid $20,000... Where did they come from? - They're friends. About that price. - Mr. Hatch, I do dislike quibbling bout money. 20,000 it is. - I never take assignment unless I know who it is I'm supposed to take care of. - The name is McCourt. - McCourt. - That's right. Charlie McCourt. - Charlie McCourt? - Yes. - You talking about Bloody Charlie McCourt? - That's right. Well, Mr. Hatch. Where is he? - Looks like he's not interested, Mr. Stobridge. - Come on, come on. Yeah, come on, come on. - Give me that. Locoweed. You feed this stuff to the horses, they'll run off half crazy. What are you trying to do? Get up. You're with McCourt, aren't you? He sent you back here to see that we didn't come after him, didn't he? - Why would I do that? Hey, McCourt's worth money to me too. - That's strictly between you and him, lady. But it's the only thing that makes any sense. - Yeah, well who's gonna believe you? - Hawkes. He's already suspicious, I seen it in his eyes. So are the others. Now get moving. - You sure you want to do this? - You bet. - Too bad. - What do you mean too bad? One less to split the reward money with. - There'll be more money in it for you if you don't tell Brady. Why do you think McCourt's going to Jubilee? Because there's a million dollars waiting for him there. - [chuckles] Sounds like you've been taking that locoweed yourself. - Well, think about it. What other reason would he have for going into that desert? Otherwise he would've headed straight for Mexico. Yeah, you're right. McCourt made a deal with me. $80,000, if I keep Brady from catching up to him. Now if you help me, half of its yours. It's about twice what'd you be getting if you split the bounty with the others. - Stopping Hawkes, that's a big gamble. - Collecting that bounty would be too. - How do I know the million dollars is there? - I got its straight from McCourt. Otherwise I wouldn't be here. - Me and you'd be dead. - No, he would. You're just gonna have to trust me. - I want a little something up front. - What do you mean? - I need something from you to seal the bargain. - That's not part of the deal. - I'm making it that way. [dramatic music] - Just what the hell's going on here? - He just tried to get a little friendly. - This is strictly between me and the lady. - Well, that's not the way I see it. Why don't you get back to camp? - I'm not taking orders from you anymore, Brady. The war is over. - I said get back to the camp! - And I said I'm taking no more orders! This ain't the old days. - I'll say it another way. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm alright. - Oh, you don't know how Long I've waited for a chance to do this. Especially during the war. - Put that knife away, Reece. - See, you're still giving orders. But it's not like it was then. You stick a commanding officer, you end up rotting in a stockade, waiting to be hanged. It's different out here, Brady. Ah, should've expected it, coming from a gambling man. - And I sure wouldn't want to disappoint you. - Brady. No harm done. - You know, Reece. You're beginning to stink of trouble. And if you ever pull that knife on me or anyone else in my camp, I will kill you. - It won't happen again, Brady. I can promise you that. [somber music] - That them, Charlie? - Yeah, that's them. Kate's still with them. What keeps him going? Why does he keep coming? - He keeps coming Charlie, because we have his boy, and as long as we do, he'll keep right on coming. - Well, I ain't letting the kid go! Cause he's the only insurance we got. What the hell's wrong with her? She's supposed to be doing something to slow him down. - [Man] It appears your lady friend isn't exactly doing her job. - She's got too much at stake not to. - What do you want to do, Charlie? - Well, we can't stay here. We better ride for it. - What about Silvera? - He'll just have to catch up. Come on men, we're pulling out. Go get the horses. - It might be best to leave me and keep going. Then maybe my dad would stop chasing you. - Listen, kid. Like it or not, you're worth a million dollars to me. Colonel, I think it would be a good idea if you taught this kid to keep a reign on his tongue, or he'll end up damaged goods! - Yeah, well my dad will catch up-- - Easy, boy. He didn't mean that, Charlie. Let me tell you something, boy. About the hush of early morn, now I am commanding you to silence. Silence, you've got that? You're gonna be good? You gonna do what I tell ya? Alright, be useful. Clean up around this camp, go at it. [kid screaming] [horses whinny] Oh my God, no! [kid screams] Stop that, stop that! Stop it! - Let him go. That kid could've left us afoot, stranded us here. - That's your own fault. I told you you should've left me behind. - Charlie, I've known their spade. Turn him over to somebody else! - Somebody else would've killed him. - Charlie, we've got the horses, but them other riders are coming on fast. - We're moving out. Keep him under control, or I'll kill him. Brady, let's go! - Boy. You gotta stop doing what you're trying to do. You gotta. - Well, I'm not gonna. [horses trotting] - Well, it looks like they pulled outta here in a hurry. Jeremiah. - He was here, alright. These tracks are fresh. - Well, that means he's safe, Brady. - Not safe, but at least alive. We gotta stay on him. - [Man] Moving out! [horses trotting] - I thought you said Charlie would be here! - That's what he said. If he ain't, you gotta know there's a good reason. - Hawkes. - Hawkes. - He forced them to pull out. That means he's found them. - Well, then we will find Senor Hawkes. - Is this your idea of a watering hole, Pike? - I don't know what to tell you, Brady. All the years I've been through here, I've seen it low, but never this dry. You know, most of the time we'd be underwater by now. I've seen the water clear up over this ridge. - None of that's gonna help us now though, Pike. - I don't think my horse can make it in this heat, Brady. - I don't think any of them can. - Well, these are fresh tracks. McCourt thinks he can make it. - Well, I don't care what McCourt does. We're not going on in this heat. We'll rest here, and travel tonight when it's cooler. - Hawkes. You ain't never gonna catch McCourt, cause you ain't as mean as he is. - I'll get him, alright. Cause there's a time to be mean, and a time to be smart. - Well, I suggest we all find some shade, and cool off. - Pack up, we're moving out. - What are you talking about? - Hawkes just gave us the perfect opportunity, so we're leaving now. - Well, it's too hot. The horses won't make it. - Two can't, six can. When ours give out, we'll just use theirs. - You're crazy, Reece. I'm just supposed to slow them down, not kill them. - Lady, it's now or never. You're the one who told me bout the million dollars. Where is it? - The Jubilee Bank. - How's he supposed to get it? - Charlie says he's got a way. - Look, it's not that I don't trust you, honey. But Brady and I was in the army together. We were sort of comrades. And before I double cross a partner, I want to make damn sure well it's worth it, and that the money is there. - It's there. But this isn't the way to get it. - Well then I guess I'm just too greedy to pass it up. Pack up, I'm leaving in five minutes, with or without you. And the horses are going with me. - Billy! - What? - Reece is taking all the horses. - Taking all the horses? Why the devil would he do that? - Brady. Billy's having some trouble with Reece. - Oh, no, where are they? - At the horses. [intense music] - Hold it, Reece! - Reece! [gun fires] Why couldn't you wait? We were so close. - You're not as close as you think. - Brady. Brady, why'd he try to do that? I thought he was a friend of yours. - So did I. [somber music] - You were supposed to keep an eye on him. Where is he? - I don't know, Charlie. He was here by the horses a minute ago, and now he's gone! - Well, he can't have got far. Alright, everybody spread out! Look for the boy! [heavy breathing] - Looks like a cavalry's been through here! It would be hard to tell which trail McCourt took! - You've been here before, Wichita. What were their choices? - Well, you get to El Dorado either way, but if he's gonna go on through to Jubilee, he's gonna have to go that way. - Well now don't forget, they need to get water and supplies real bad. - Well, when we're playing it this close, I think we have to cover all the bets. Wichita, you and Masket go with Kate, Billy and I will go this way, and if we don't find anything before the cutoff, we'll made you back in El Dorado. - See ya. We are still in Arizona, aren't we? - Thereabouts. - Well, Brady, I've been doing some thinking. Didn't we just leave Arizona a couple of weeks back? - That was Southern Arizona, this is Eastern Arizona. - Well, I sure don't recognize the difference. You know, all my life, I've been waiting to see the ocean. Remember, I spent most of it behind a plow in South Dakota. At the time, I figured that was as far away from an ocean breeze as I'd ever be. Until now. I get the distinct feeling my life is traveling in circles. - Dad, Dad, Dad! Dad, I'm over here! [exciting music] - It's Jeremiah! I'm coming, son! I'm coming! Hold on! [exciting music] - [Billy] You think these horses can make it up there? - No, but we can. Grab some rope. [hopeful music] Are you alright? - Yeah! I knew you'd come. - Where's McCourt? - I think I lost him! - See if you can find a way down! We're coming to get you! - Alright! - We got him, Billy. We got him now. [chuckling] [exciting music] - Dad! - Jeremiah. - Boy, am I glad to see you. - I'm glad to see you too, son. Can you come down this way? - Not here, it's too steep. - Brady, the rope. - Here, grab this! You can come down this. [ominous music] - Take up the slack. - Hawkes. I don't want to have to kill you or the kid. But I need this boy to get into that bank at Jubilee. And once I get the money, I'll turn him loose. But I'm warning you. If you keep coming, you'll find your boy dead. You hear me, Hawkes? You hear me? - I hear you. - Come on, kid. - Stop! Let go of me! I want to be with my dad! - Listen, kid! You don't have to be alive at that bank. They only have to think you are. You understand me? - Ah. He means it, Brady. - I know. - Maybe we oughta stop and just let him have the money, huh? He said he'd let Jeremiah go-- - I can't stop! There ain't no money in Jubilee. Stobridge was only buying me time, don't you remember? He's gonna move the money before we ever get there. And once McCourt finds that out, Jeremiah is as good as dead. - But we all knew that. We all knew it was gonna be a gamble. But that's nothing new for you. You're the best. - [chuckles] That's gambling with money. This is my son's life, and I'm responsible for it. If I make one little mistake, you heard what he said, just one, and it's all over. - It's not all over yet. You just saw Jeremiah up there alive and kicking, and raising up a ruckus, didn't you? - He is a tough little guy, isn't he? [laughs] - He sure is. And all we have to do is just find a way to get him back. - Then let's find a way. [train whistle blows] - My goodness, Mr. Stobridge. Why don't you sit down and relax? Have a drink or something. - Can't make the train go any faster by pacing around. Come and sit with us. - I do not want to have a drink, and I don't feel like sitting down. - We'll be getting at The Crossing soon. The wagon should be there. - How long is it going to take to get from there to Jubilee? - A little more than a day. I still think we have time to get there before McCourt. - What are we gonna be doing while you're gone? - Maybe we can go on to San Francisco and wait for you there. - Yes. - I'm afraid not. You ladies are gonna have to stay here on the train and wait 'til I get back. With my million dollars in cash. - You're right, Mr. Stobridge. Somehow going on to San Francisco without you just wouldn't be the same. [horses trotting] - Hold her right there! [laughing] It's only me. - How old are you, Billy? - 26, ma'am. Why? - You draw on me like that again, you won't make 27. - Oh. Well, I'm sorry, ma'am. - Where's Brady? - Oh, he's over yonder checking on something. Said when ya'll got here to set up a camp. Well, come on, come on. I found us a nice place right over here. [lighthearted music] [horse whinnies] - What'd ya find? - Silvera, alright. He's following us, and there's three of them. - Who are these guys, and who's Silvera? - Some of McCourt's men. Silvera is the mean one. We tangled with him once before. Looks like he's come back for a second helping, Brady. - Well, I don't understand, Brady. If he's so mean and they're chasing us, why are we stopping? - I guess I just don't like being chased. So I figure if he's gonna chase me, I'm gonna let him catch me. - Did it ever occur to you that if you get caught, we get caught? - Not necessarily. They're only expecting to find me and Billy. Maybe we can use this to our advantage. Pike, why don't you make up some of that miserable stew you used to make. - Miserable? Last time I made some, you ate so much, you swoll up like a tick. [ominous music] - [Wichita] Billy! - Hey! - Come on, get up, this is important. I'm gonna teach you how to make this stew. You ain't gonna be around forever. Gotta pass these recipes along. Now, a lot of people start with a cold pot, and they notice the first thing I did was grease this down with axle grease that way the meat won't get all sticky in there. Now, see? See that wing there? That's a sage hen, and there's kind of a slow moving gopher. Couldn't find no prairie oysters, though. - Pike, ain't that a fly? [ominous music] - You called it right, Silvera. They're just sitting there. Feels like they're cooking up a meal. - Now what are we waiting for? Let's take 'em. - We'll take them when they least expect it. When they start eating, that's when they'll die. Maybe we got a free meal. [laughing] Oh. You take that boulder over there, eh? Carson, take the high point. Hey. Wait for my signal. [ominous music] - The only time Brady lets me be leader is when someone's fixing to shoot at us. I am getting nervous. - Yeah. I know what you mean. [tense music] [ominous music] [loud yelling] [gun fires] - Wichita, are you alright? [guns firing] - You alright? - Yeah. It's the right leg, woodpecker's done worse. - Yeah, it looks like they got the rest. - Huh? - Brady, come on down! The stew's getting cold! There's another one of those suckers. - Sheriff on duty? - Nope. - Is he around? - No, he's over to Youngstown, for a hanging. - Seems to be contagious. - Got a couple of fellas we need to lock up. - Well, I reckon there'll be some bounty coming here. - I don't know anything about any bounty. I'm just the Sheriff's nephew. I'm looking after the place while he's gone. I can't lock nobody up. - I'll lock him up for you, son. Kate, you should take care of the horses. - Sure, see you at the saloon. - I seen them two men! On a poster, in the Sheriff's office. That's Jesus Silvera! - It's Jesus, gringo, Jesus! - Come on. - They ride with the McCourt gang, don't they? - They did. - I'll be darned. Uncle Henry's gonna be surprised when he gets back to see this! - He sure will, son. - You're supposed to be getting me some breathing room. - I'm trying. Hawkes is good. They want you bad, Charlie. Real bad. What'd you do to him? - The question is, what are you doing to me? You're supposed to be slowing him down. Here he is in the same town I'm in. I've got two men in jail, and one dead. Way to deal, Kate. - Look, all you asked me for was time. Well now's your chance. Brady says we're laying over for the night. - Where's Pete? - Oh, he's over in the saloon with Wichita. Which isn't a bad idea. Come on, Brady. I'll buy you one. [chuckles] - You know, this Silvera mess has really slowed us down. - Ah, what the heck. You can't get the bounty vouchers 'til tomorrow anyway. - Billy, you know I don't care about the bounty. - Well, you better. Or you're gonna have a mutiny on your hands. Remember, that's why the rest of them are riding with us. - If you ride out now, you'll have half a day's head start. - What about you? - I'll try and catch up. - I'm taking Dear Valley Pass. I can't wait for you, Kate. - I didn't think you would. - I'll see you in Jubilee. - You better be there, Charlie. - I'll be there. - Because if you're not, I'll find you. Guaranteed. - We riding, Boss? - No, we gotta bust Silvera and Holt outta jail. - Then we're leaving? - We're gonna kill 'em all. - The woman too? - I said all. - Ain't this typical? That Reece never was around when you really needed him. - You know, Pike. Don't you think using that big a knife to get a bullet out of your leg is a lot like shooting squirrel with a shotgun? Just a mess. - Now hold on, Brady. Before you go carving on me, don't you think I need something to dull the pain? [laughing] - I think you're right. Bartender, some medicine for this sick padre. - And four glasses, padre. - Excuse me, gentlemen. Howdy, Kate. Would you like to have a drink? - Sure. - Yeah, let's sit over here. You know, I never did really get the chance to thank you for what you did for me today. That was really something, wasn't it? [laughs] We're getting to be quite a team. Yeah. That Brady's the best. - You like him, don't you? - Like him? I'm only here because of him. - It doesn't make sense. A man like Brady, hunting bounty. - Brady's not doing this for the bounty. Oh, he's letting the rest of us divvy that up. He's not taking one penny for it. - Then why is he after McCourt? - McCourt's got his son. - His son? - Yeah. We were on the train when they robbed it. Charlie McCourt took Jeremiah hostage. Hey, Brady. How about that drink that I promised you? - Oh, no thank you. I'm gonna go to the hotel and take care of our rooms. You alright, Kate? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Guess we could just all use some rest. See you tomorrow. - [Billy] Good night. [dramatic music] [loud crash] - Get down, it's McCourt! [guns firing] - Masket! Get me my leg! [guns firing] Get the bags! [guns firing] Billy! Catch it! Light it! [guns firing] Throw it! [guns firing] - Let's get them, boys. - Got any dynamite? - I always have dynamite. - Let me have it. [guns firing] How much time have I got? - Not much! [dynamite explodes] - We got him! We got him on the run! Brady, we got them on the run! [guns firing] Woo hoo! You got three of them! - Yeah, but we didn't get McCourt, I just saw him ride out of town. - How are we gonna trail him in the dark? - Wichita, you know your way around, which way would he go to Jubilee? - Hell, there's two possible ways to get there. - Maybe I can make it easier for you. They're headed for Deer Valley Pass. - Now how do you know that? - Because McCourt told me. - McCourt told you? - I've been working with McCourt. My job was to slow you down anyway I could. - Slow me down? They've got my son, Kate. And if I don't get him back before they get to Jubilee, they're gonna kill him. - Damn it, Brady. I didn't know anything about your son! You didn't tell me! I thought you were in it for the bounty like the rest of us! - She is the one who threw the chair through the window. - Brady. Don't worry about McCourt or Deer Valley Pass. You take the long route, and I guarantee you get to Jubilee before he does. Come on, Masket. - She also woke me up to tell me that Reece was making off with the horses. Now I don't know what she's done to slow us down, but she's saved our lives more than once. - Brady. I'd like to ride with you. I might come in handy. - I don't know that I can trust you. But I do need you. - You can trust me. [exciting music] - Hey, Silvera, I see you're still alive. - It's been touch and go, my friend. - Where are the others? - Dead. Hawkes is right behind us. - Get mounted, we're going to Jubilee. [exciting music] - No sign of them yet? - No, but they're coming, you can count on it. - What's the plan? - The plan? We're gonna blow up this whole pass! - How are we gonna do it? - We ain't gonna do it. You are. From down there. - Why me? - Because you're younger and I got this wooden leg. Let's start tying your rope off on that tree, let's go boy. I hate to rush you boy, but they're coming. Now don't worry. They all got long fuses. - I don't know much about dynamite, you know? - You're gonna learn today. - Wish we had more time to discuss this. I don't smoke. - You do now. Come on. You're gonna do real good, I know it. Come on. - You don't seem to be very concerned about my health. - I am, I am. Get going. - Looks clear. Let's mount up! [dynamite explodes] [horses whinny] - Atta boy, atta boy, you got them! [horses whinny] - They blocked the pass! We gotta go back! We'll have to go around another way. [laughing] - They'll never get through now! Good work! Come on, get back up here! We got him, we stomped him, come on! [horse whinnies] - Kate. Before we get to Jubilee, I think we need to talk. - Alright. - I told you in El Dorado I didn't trust you, but I needed you. But I need to trust you. - Up 'til now, you've been playing your cards pretty close to the vest, Brady. So have I. But no more. You can trust me. - I hope so. Cause when the chips are down, I don't want to have to worry about you and McCoy. - When Billy told me about your son, that changed everything. You see, I have a son too. He's six years old. - Where is he? - Somewhere in Oklahoma. I've been trying to find him for the past two years now. - Trying to find him? What happened? - Fire and brimstone preacher took him away from me because I was unmarried. He condemned me for having a child. He claimed he was going to provide a good home for him until I reformed and found God. - Then what? - The good reverend gave him to some farmers passing through. So I've been hiring some Pinkerton men to find him. Not just one, but a dozen. That takes money. - That's why you're hunting bounty. To raise money to find your child. Well, what happened to his father? - Well, we'll be seeing him tomorrow in Jubilee. Charlie McCourt. That's Jessie's father. [exciting music] - Can't you make these horses go any faster? Whip them man, whip them! [exciting music] - You've lost valuable time, amigo. Maybe too much. Hawkes will be in Jubilee before us. - Or on the trail waiting for us. But we've got the kid, that's our way through. - As long as we have the boy, Hawkes will be cautious. But if we get the money, then what? - That kid's our insurance getting into Jubilee, he's also our insurance getting out. - You mean you're not gonna let him go? - Even if I have to take him all the way to Mexico. - You haven't said anything all morning. That sure isn't like you, Mr. Greeley. - Mr. Greeley. No one's called me Mr. Greeley in a long time. You know, I've been thinking about what you asked me, why I don't leave. I think that's solid advice, boy. - You said they'd hang you. - Maybe. Maybe I'd be willing to take my chances on that. You hold tight, boy. - What are you gonna do? - Just hold tight. - Greeley, what do you think you're doing? - Charlie, Greeley! Oh God damn, you get the horse! [guns firing] [groaning] - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - But look at your arm! - Run for it, lad! Run! - But they'll kill you! - When will you learn to listen to your elders, boy. - I knew you weren't one of us. - One stumbling block, Charlie. My self pride. - Get out of the way, boy. - If you kill him, I'll never stop giving you trouble. Never. You'll have to kill me too. If you don't kill him, I'll do anything you want me to. I'll do anything you say. - I figure that's worth the price of a bullet. Get up here, boy. You're riding with me. Come on, let's get out of here. - Bye, Mr. Greeley. - Come on! - Take care of yourself, lad. [hopeful music] - Silvera, watch the bank from there. Alright, kid, remember what you promised. No trouble. - Morning, sir. May I help you? You'll have to see Mr. Telford about this. - Telford? - He's the president of our bank. - Get him. - Well, he's just right over there at his desk. You can go on back. - You, Telford. We've got some business to do, and I'm in a hurry. - Dad! - [Brady] Jeremiah. - He's not yours yet. I suggest we concentrate on keeping this boy alive, Hawkes. We'll start by handing me your gun. Now sit down. - [Masket] Got a plan? - I always got a plan. - That letter says a million dollars in cash. I want it now or the boy dies. - Mr. Hawkes, I can't possibly-- - Mr. Stobridge signed it, didn't he? - Well, yes. - Then get him the money. - Well, if it ain't that Mr. Millionaire train fella. [chuckles] - Let me handle this, Pettibone. - I'm afraid you're just a might too late. - Please stand aside. [chuckles] Gentlemen. You have my assurance that if I'm inside, that money will be turned over a lot easier, with a lot less trouble. I am unarmed. Thank you, gentlemen. - You best be moving that buggy, mister. And you go along with it. Now. - [Pettibone] Let's go. - [Teller] There you are, sir. One million dollars cash. - Alright, McCourt. You got your money. Now I want my boy. - That's my money! - Hold it, get back. Get rid of it. The other hand. Move off. Pick it up, kid. - Now listen, McCourt. I signed that letter because of the boy. But I'm warning you, you try to walk out of this bank with that money, I'll have you hunted down. - Nobody's gonna hunt me down, as long as I got this kid. Ain't that right, Hawkes? [tense music] [loud cheering] - Whoa, Rocky! Hey fellers! You're looking at a rich man here, a rich man, yes sir. [cackles] Gold! Gold! Buckets full of it back there. Yeah, I've been digging up in these hills for a long time. [laughs] They said I was crazy. Well, I'm not crazy. [laughs] I'm rich! - Gold, huh? - Yeah! Come on you two, give me a hand. I'll give you a hunk of this here gold if you can even lift the box out of the wagon. [chuckles] Feast your eyes on this! - Hello, boys. [chuckles] - Silvera? [loud screaming] [suspenseful music] - Excuse me. - [Man] Oh my God, look out, look out. [groaning] [ominous music] - I'll see you in hell! - Maybe. You're gonna get there first. [yelling] [laughing] - [Man] It's a misfire. - Get back! Holt, Juno, Silvera. [suspenseful music] - Woo! Go on, Brady! [laughs] Get up, get up! - This is what you've been waiting for. [suspenseful music] - Come on, Brady. Come on, that's it! - Alright! [suspenseful music] [loud crashing] [glass breaks] - [Man] Come on Brady, get him up. Come on, get him up! - Sorry, ma'am. - Oh, that's alright. [suspenseful music] - [Man] One more! [laughs] Woo! He got him. Woo hoo! [laughing] - Jeremiah! - We collect that bounty now, Brady. You got a share coming! - You boys share the bounty. I got what I was looking for. - Hope we do it again sometime! - Well, Hawkes. I guess you've got us both what we wanted. I don't want you to think I'd of let anything happen to the boy because of the money. Money doesn't really mean all that much to me. Pettibone, take care of that. - Shall I put it back in the bank? - No. I'm taking it with us, I don't trust banks anymore. [chuckles] - Brady. I was rooting for you. - Thanks, Billy. [chuckles] - Would you throw that dynamite away and give me a hand here? - Dynamite! Dynamite! Dynamite! [explosion booms] [horse whinnies] [loud commotion] [laughing] - San Francisco, Brady? - Why not? Kate, are you with us? - Why not?
