ON THE MOTIVES OF THE STORY OF O. DADZAY "THE CONFESSION OF A DEFEATED "MAN" Youzo-san ... Yoshiko ... My whole life was full of shame. LOSS OF HUMANITY NOTEBOOK ONE Character Artist Yusuke KOZAKI Production Designer Kenichiro TOMIYASU Monster Design: Masahiro ITO Scriptwriter To UBUKATA Director Fuminori KIZAKI SHELL says health and longevity service. Genetic engineering, regeneration, nanomachines and a cure for all diseases. Thanks to them, for half a century we do without doctors - the first in the world. It's time to congratulate those of the first generation who lived for average more than one hundred and twenty years. Holiday, Day of Validity, will take place on September 15 at the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo. These people were fighting devastation after the war and raised the economy, these are real pioneer heroes. Healthy old age, which befell them, HAPPINESS IS HEALTH AND LONGEVITY became a source of hope for all of us. We thank the state for our healthy life. You are listening to the message about the Day of Validity from Yoshiko Hiiragi of SHELL Press Office. All the same, I am a man ... I'll defend my right ... I feel "lost." We fly outside. Takada-no-baba area. First squad, get ready. As a man... You always feel them unmistakably. Is he going to be "lost" now? Yes. Drops out of our human network I can't hold him. Again HNP blockers? If Masao Horiki came up with regular pills it is clear why we have so many "losses" ... The object is mutating! The nanomachines in it got out of control. It's me. Get ready to deal with Horiki. Find him and detain him. It won't be easy to find him since he is offline. Block off the entire area. Four in the morning, everyone is driving home from work. It is impossible that "lost" caught the eyes of citizens. The cultural outline is in motion. I don't know if Horiki is the reason or not, but if you leave him free we risk "losing" the entire nation. There was a "loss"! First squad, drop off. Immediately activate your armor and special swords. Divide and surround "Lost" from three sides. Shoot him with electrified wire. Power is four to loosen. Be careful, remember about the tentacles. Get ready ... Fire! Introduce the chemical! In front, beware! Power to maximum, do not retreat! First, your armor is damaged! - Get away! - Understood, retreat. Injection! Zero, says the second. Lost is quiet. Okay, let's get him. OUTSIDE, BEYOND THE 16TH RING ROAD. YOKOGAMA, NOGE DISTRICT What about the explosion ... Well ... The city is getting ready to celebrate the first day of usefulness, and here is such a terrible accident. Yes ... And yet completely young, so sorry ... To live to be one hundred and twenty so that all the people congratulate you happy day fullvalues ​​- this is the height of happiness, the result of all life! You are right, we live in a wonderful time. It is wonderful, when after a hundred there is something to strive for. They have a day of usefulness! Bastards ... Mistress, shut down the TV. - Now. - It's sickening to listen. They lie without shame and conscience. Here. They say, in fact there the terrorist exploded. Where are the terrorists from now? Say it too ... And what, here everyone will want blow it all to hell. What is life when a worker day - nineteen hours ... But to the next world, buddy, they won't just let go. Hi Takeichi. Even though you explode into pieces SHELL will collect you back. Here at the factory the arms and legs were torn off with a machine, and nothing, I live on, thanks "SHELL"! Did you make such prostheses on purpose? It's a pity that everything will grow back soon. Why are you sitting? Would you like to hang out with my guys? Not really... You always have the same thing on your mind. Stop raving already and go to work fine. Make me a million yen in retirement! A powerful thing, tell me? Madam still wow, though really does not rejuvenate. Yes, Masao-san? Well, where is our artist? Upstairs. Has been sitting there since yesterday. I once praised his picture as a child. So he will not stop painting! Although here outside you won't earn a dime. There might be buyers inside. Well yeah everybody just runs to buy the creativity of outsiders. But in general this is a thought. Since today we finally Let's make our way Inside! I've fiddled with Youzo so much now let him support me. I will introduce you to the gallery owners. Youzo, we've come. So, great again ... Hey, Youzo. Live! He looked into his soul and fell into despair ... Yes, it’s a whim, he’s just too lazy to live. Always like this. Taking sleeping pills? It is unknown what they are putting there now ... Hello Hello. You called the SHELL dispatch service. I'm listening to your question. Yes, there is a dead man here ... Hold on. Determining your coordinates. I see you. What is the registration number citizen or family. Youzo Ooba. We are from orphanages. Yes, seven digits in the number. Precisely, he lives behind the roundabout. I see a cardiac arrest due to drug overdose. - Life activity is suspended. - What difference does it make, fix it soon. I activate his GRNP. Nanomachines in breeding mode, I begin to regenerate organs. Smile, Youzo. Youzo, smile! Hey, Youzo. Hey... Takeichi? .. Masao-san ... You seem to be fine. The restoration has been completed. I recommend to refrain from ... You draw all sorts of crap, but you don't take your phone? Today is a great day I called you with us! Turn the world around with our biker gang! - I do not know... - What is there to know? How sour you are. Come down to us, genius! Smile, Youzo. Takeichi is right, this is a great day. Well? Come with us. Good. Come on, help me ... “Four inventions thanks to which people do not get sick and quickly heal any injury implemented the service health care SHELL ". And so that we are the same like an old man inside a roundabout, we were stuffed with nanomachines and trying to control. Aren't you disgusted? They, you know, fatten and breathe clean air. And us, so that we do not die, connected to the human network. AIR CLEANING IS PRODUCED They do not allow us to live normally, nor to die. The air inside is also dirty. Is it true? To stay human people need death. It was not me, but Masao-san who said it. We will win back ours today. For this, a raid on the Inner is needed! Do you agree? Yes, probably... Takeichi-san, it's time. Great, let's go! WE STORM SHELL! Listen to me! SHELL says she cares about us but in fact he exploits like a cattle! A pretty "people's good" ... We are clowns for them! - Quiet! - You are awesome! Run for the premiere! For the presidency! We have not managed to break through but today we can! EXPLOSIVE We or SHELL, we or the Inner - who is stronger? We won't die anyway. So let's light it up and show them so as not to joke with the "clowns"! - Exactly! - Right! See, do not disappear from navigators! Vanguard, scatter the dogs along the road to the tunnel. The main detachment, guard the hearse with explosives to the bridge. And then personally I will pass from the tunnel across the bridge in forty three seconds! Whoever got outside the gate was Inside! The victory will be ours. Let's go! Wonderful speech, Takeichi. This will help me find myself, right? That's right, Takeichi. Youzo, over there is your bike. Wait a minute. Take you too. And I? Don't you want to know the truth? Find your real look. I stopped you for speeding. Stop immediately. Oh you rubbish! Here's to you, here's to you, here's to you! Like this! The dogs are on our tail. And from the direction of Kawasaki they come running. On the highway from Yokohama a large group of hooligans. They smashed the checkpoint. Again? How tired they are ... If you continue to disobey, according to article 22.2 Road traffic regulations, action will be taken against you ... You are under arrest for disorderly conduct. Get it! Know ours. Reconstructive procedures are required. I activate the GRNP. I see extensive injuries and substance abuse. Atsugi, Sibuta says. In Yokohama, GRNP are massively involved. We are in the know. This is a group of outsider workers dashing on the road, going to the center. They know they will still survive and come off as they can. They enjoy hurt yourself ... Thanks to SHELL, people don't get sick but this neurosis spread. Desire for amputation syndrome? I would tell about it to the Full-fledged ... HEALTH SERVICE They won't listen to us. Better tell me Have you missed the GRNP blockers? Yes, they were accepted by several the person in this group. It is not yet clear whether they will be "lost" or not. Drive the dogs away! What good, shies right here. Are we really going to make an explosion? What's wrong with your eyes? .. This is from the pill that Masao gave. Something made me look prettier! It seems like it's true today will be able to send everything to hell! And there is. The cultural outline is in motion. What is it? Without a driver? Is PALTus flying? An empty car? Or is there someone in her not connected to the human network. That is, she is being led by another The candidate is the same as me. Masao Horiki ... Where is he? For motorcyclists - a gray sedan! Bastard. So you got caught. Stop! Is this really Horiki? How did he end up with the bikers? May be, he wants to arrange a massive "loss" in the hope that at the same time will the third Candidate come to light? Third Candidate, you say? In order not to "lose" people anymore, we need someone perfect SHELL compatible. I believe that for this to come to light a third Candidate will appear. Do not rush. So far, Highs are asking cultural contour, and we support it. And other ways to protect people and "SHELL" we do not have. Until this image of the future is lost, a new ruler of destinies must appear, otherwise civilization will not be reborn. Okay, so be it. But what if this third will go over to Horiki's side? Instead of the fourth protocol, we introduce the third. Eliminate all "lost" ones. What if a Candidate is among them? Director, with this tactic we run the risk of missing Horiki. Risk must be avoided at all costs. We protect the society we have not a future that is not the fact that will come. We act according to the third protocol! Let's intercept them at the exit from the tunnel. Damn you!.. Takeichi, are you safe? We won't be prevented from getting Inside. Victory will be ours! I can't keep up with you, Takeichi ... Takeichi! Youzo ... Smile! We close the bridge. EMERGENCY CLOSURE We climbed deep, this is a new record. Let's go! Don't let me down! Takeichi ... Exactly forty-three seconds. The eastern gate has been breached! Close western. Fast! Fire! Takeichi? Saw? I still ... won ... It's true inside ... the air is cleaner ... This is not the police ... Now "will be lost"! Takeichi! Watch out. Fire! - There's one more "loss"! - Another one?! Don't get caught in the tornado! The first was overwhelmed. We need some help!.. There were two “lost”. Our entire first squad has been destroyed! The second squad is following me! We sit down urgently - right on the bridge. We take all the drones with us. My remedy works reliably but this is not Orpheus ... Again, no luck. Destroy the "lost"! Our task is to destroy them completely! Yoshiko, it's dangerous there! In the second "lost" I can feel the reaction of the GRNP. Like this?.. - What's the matter? - I read his mind. Does the “lost” one have thoughts? Stop. What was it? - Do not! - Yoshiko! Transformed back ... into a human ... He is alive and remains himself. It doesn't work that way. We saw how he was "lost"! This is who we were hoping for. This is the third Candidate! Where did another cultural contour come from? Civilization will either collapse or be reborn. Are there any other options? Orpheus returned from the kingdom of the dead. It's time for people to become human again. SECOND NOTEBOOK UNTIL DAY OF COMPLETENESS 97 DAYS This is Sibuta, I'm here. Sorry to disturb you. Please don’t worry. You gentlemen Full-fledged - our standard of health, landmark on the way of the people to longevity. Serve you always and in everything - the debt of SHELL employees as part of taking care of the health of citizens. The Third Candidate Who Was Foretold ... Who would have thought, created by Masao Horiki its blockers GRNP. I've been living in the world for a long time but have not seen cultural the circuit was so unstable. Sibuta, give an assessment of the situation. Yes. Firstly, Yozo Ooba is undoubtedly influences the cultural circuit. But what does he contribute to, revival of civilization or collapse, we haven't installed yet. Although the second Candidate, Yoshiko Hiiragi, claims to be the key to salvation. Yes? Youzo Ooba is different from Masao Horiki with his necromancer abilities and from the healer Yoshiko Hiiragi. His ability is to destroy the "lost". I believe that he will become for us an important weapon in the fight against Horiki. He is really "lost" and then took on human form again? Yes. This also differs from the other two. That is, you need to do Yozo Oobu one of the standards of health on a par with us, and this, you believe will allow you to avoid the appearance of "lost"? Yes. In order to do this, I, Sibuta, will give all my strength. That's fine. May it contribute to our desire live more than one hundred and eighty years. Understood. It is possible with time recognize Ooba as Full. But first he must be taken under control. The standard of health needs intervene with caution so as not to harm the people. Will be taken into account. Youzo, yes you draw cool! You woke up? Why is this? They will be removed if our conversation will pass without complications. My name is Yoshiko Hiiragi. Youzo Ooba-san, you're at Sibuta's agency. It, together with SHELL, creates new technologies for the health of citizens. What monsters have I seen? I AM... You died and then came back to life. You have entered your GRNP back into normal mode and recovered. It is amazing. You are without a doubt the one The candidate who will save everyone. What is it all about? Now it is difficult for you, but soon you will understand everything. Where is Takeichi? Take me to him! Atsugi, are you sure this is prudent? Yes. In case of excesses, the squad is ready for battle. 111 YEAR OF SHOWA, JUNE 8 / 05:27 / ODAIBA / MAN Is this Takeichi? Can not be. You know about the four components revolution in medicine? Genetic engineering, regeneration, nanomachines and a panacea. They are abbreviated by the abbreviation "GRNP". They are all under SHELL network management. I know that myself! But how, how can a man turn into this? The so-called "loss". If you lose connection with the network, HRNPs in the body are disoriented. Chaos ensues. I thought you were dying ... This has not been disclosed. They are usually not held within the boundaries of the body. and take this form. That's what he had with him. Mysterious picture. A horse from the underworld ... - What? - This is my first job. Takeichi praised her. He said that he wants to find himself ... and what happened? Who is the clown here after that? This must happen rare, but cases have become more frequent. Apparently, because of the blockers of GRNP, which is distributed to people by Masao Horiki. Masao Horiki ... In your, Is this manipulating Masao-san on purpose? Why on earth ?! To destroy the SHELL system. Does he do that? I do not believe. A blocker that can't decipher even the SHELL, not to be made by anyone else. We must protect citizens from Horiki and from "losses". We need you, Youzo-san. This is some kind of continuous nonsense ... Good. Let me go home and I agree to help you. This will make Ooba our ally ... To release him is too dangerous. Horiki will try to meet him. That's why you two will be guarding him. By the way, this is also a chance to catch Horiki. You'd better admit it soon him and Yoshiko Perfect and added to the standard of health. The Awesomes themselves approve of this. But we cannot predict the effect. You have to tread carefully. These are old people you don't allow you to make a decision? What do we even want? Just keep things as they are? Shall we wait until society collapses? They are also not immortal. There were three hundred and thirty full-fledged, and now there are only one hundred and eighty left. First you need to extend their life ... - I'll go with him. - Yoshiko! Do not worry. I will prove that Ooba-san will become the savior of civilization. We have taken off, we are following you. We also have everything regular. It is possible that Ooba is the first will make contact with Horiki. I'll run a search engine. Of course, against Horiki, she is of little use. Many thanks. - And that's what. - Yes. Act calmly, without fanaticism. Do not worry. Officially announced that Takeichi-san had an accident. You, too, will not be punished for breaking the order. You can hide everything ... We went Outside. Here begins ... The country of the poor. I am sincerely grateful that you agreed to cooperate. I know SHELL is an imperfect system. Living conditions are still imperfect and I know how many people are suffering in poverty. But we will build a society where everyone will be healthy and happy, and Takeichi's tragedy will not happen again. I believe in it. - I remembered who you are. - Yes? The same Yoshiko Hiiragi, you are often shown on TV. Yes. I am part-time I work in the press service. What makes you try so hard? In what sense? Do you like to make of people a beast that can't even die? It seems to me that society is going to collapse. I want to save him. Simply put, want to eliminate Masao Horiki. Fine. I will help. - Youzo. - Youzo! I was all worried. - It's on the news ... - I'm very well. Masao-san came? In the next morning. Said you and Takeichi got into a terrible accident. And you sit here. What a cute uniform you have! - I will change my cloth. - Well, why? Suits you! It seems to me, or you ... Yoshiko Hiiragi from SHELL. Is there a problem with Youzo? No, nothing like that. Madam, Youzo is all as good as new! Not a single scratch! They said the accident is serious and we were afraid - suddenly even the SHELL can't do it. Don't worry, Ooba-san is perfectly healthy. Yes? SHELL is great power. You brought it anyway back safe and sound. Thanks. Can I ask you something? Listen ... Youzo, we'll go up to you. The conversation will clearly be personal. Sorry, there's nowhere else to go here. How awful. And I still cleaned up! Well, sit down. With your permission. And what is your question? Let me know Is Yozo Ooba-san a member of your family? I rent him a room, let's say. He has no relatives. Or he says no. We want Ooba-san to come to work for us at SHELL. - I was looking for his loved ones. - Very suddenly. Secrecy does not allow getting in in detail. I'm sorry. Explain to me, don't explain ... But since you came here for him, does it mean that some kind of sin is found behind him? No, it's okay. As far as I know Youzo, he is a nice, honest boy. It's his father's fault. They say he abandoned the child and disappeared somewhere. True? Even at that age when you can live without parents, the poor thing sat all day at the easel. He was not friends with anyone except Takeichi. The Odd Boy. But he is also looking for his place in the world, as best he can. In painting? He painted all the pictures in the bar. Do you judge me? That I posed for him in my years naked? Not at all. But I'm glad. To those who invented the Day of Wholeness, we probably seem inferior. But who really knows what is usefulness? Everyone has beauty its own, and happiness too ... Oh, sorry, you're from the SHELL. I believe SHELL is big value and benefit for people as a source of health and longevity. Yes, you are ingeniously trusting ... I'm sorry, but in his career I don't decide anything. If he wants you serve, it will do so. Then Yozo Ooba-san goes under our responsibility. Let him paint your portrait, while you're pretty. All the best. - Where is Ooba-san? - Yes, he went somewhere ... Mommy he said that he doesn't love me anymore! Maybe I should poison myself? The only one with stormy macrophages work in the lungs ... Atsugi-san, Ooba-san was running. Sorry, I didn't keep track of him. - Do you already know where he is? - About. Follow him and I follow you. Yes sir. NO ONE NEEDS YOUR VALUABLE OPINION Am I not choking? .. Are you ... why are you here? I have access to a separate networks for the "lost". You fell out of the SHELL network, and I found you. Come with me. Does this sight surprise you? The happiness they feel people in this country - mainly the result of chemical the effects of SHELL on their brain. But some people don't like that. Let's say you and Takeichi. What's here? My laboratory. When you are a Candidate not such tricks become available. And the ability to breathe poisonous air too. Remember this. He went underground. Flowers? .. By purifying the air, SHELL adds there stimulants of growth hormones. Therefore, flowers grow quickly ... I created HNP blockers from poppy juice and own blood. I use the mechanism of influence of opium on the brain. Why did you make a monster out of Takeichi? Not me, but those who are chasing eternal youth and health. I regret that I once helped them. Have you helped? I was a medic. The last in this country. I was looking for new technologies, sparing no effort. And it turned out "SHELL" this brutal life support system. This ... did you create it? We all should have look like "lost". Yoshiko Hiiragi didn't tell you about this? She said, that some just die ... Just because that SHELL inhibits the mutation. We are made human by force. Takeichi felt this pressure. Just don’t lie that he wanted to! Die in true human form ... His wish came true. By the way, it was not someone who killed him, but you. How dare you! .. Takeichi was my friend! So not only the Candidate - you won't kill anyone for a long time. Your anger and your pride SHELL is meaningless. Time is short. I want to show you something. - Under the ground? - Yes, absolutely. Now I will transfer the image. Received. This is the Oimatsu area. It is believed that it is abandoned and there is nothing there. I feel that the state Ooba's body is changing. The pulse is quickened, the pressure rises. Dopamine is oxidized, the level of norepinephrine rises. He is angry and scared. He's with Horiki. This is a ventilation shaft! Found her. To all units: in Nogeyama Park in ventilation Yozo Ooba and Masao Horiki may be located. Prepare to land and capture Horiki on the fourth protocol. Do you know what this is? Processed biostatistics of all citizens, indicator of trends in society - the so-called "cultural contour". SHELL prays to him as to a deity. Candidates are more than higher order than SHELL. When I looked into this data, a certain image was synthesized from them. Now I will connect your network to mine. Don't fight back. Our world is moving towards this state. Over time, the Full-fledged will die out of old age, and the whole nation will become "lost." Youzo, people in an overly developed society turned out to be for him insufficiently complete. Defective? The research to which I have dedicated my life became the last nail in the coffin for human dignity. Buried alive people waiting for the torture to end. Free them is my mission my duty as the last remaining medic. As long as the SHELL exists, there will be no end to suffering. Greedy old people will want sacrifice you. Leave them, follow me. You and I will step towards death and may humanity be reborn from scratch. Not! Stop it! I have nothing to do with it! Then what do you want? If you make the wrong choice you put on a bad future. Bad future ... Can not be! Much, call the SHELL ... You see what happened to Tsuneko ... Stop it, please! Youzo ... Well done, Yozo. Doing everything right. You were there and brought to this? My mistake. But now Ooba won't cooperate with Horiki. And according to Yoshiko, Ooba evolves. We do not know this. I compared the samples taken from Yoshiko and Ooba. All nineteen amino acids they have an L-configuration, otherwise - nothing in common. Still relying on Yoshiko's intuition? And add another heavy burden to her ... After all we made her endure. One experiment after another ... Cruel fate but no one else can replace her. The same applies to Oobe ... No - perhaps to everyone who now lives in our country. Youzo-san! I won't go to PALTus. I will bring a bad future, Masao said so. He showed me a picture of destruction and I've already seen her in my nightmares. A picture of destruction? I guess he's right and madam also died because of me ... What happened to both of them are our fault. We didn't save them. I ask you to. Give me one more, one last chance! YOSHIKO HIIRAGI On this old TV tower the first SHELL developments began. I was also often brought here before. What will we do? I'll show you the future. But not the same as Masao Horiki. But first, I’ll tell you about myself. About myself? You asked which makes me try. I will explain it now. Once I was also killed. Stabbed me own father. He suddenly said: "In my opinion, now you can die for good." The last thing I remember. I looked into his soul and saw how she was "lost." I tried my best to hold him back. And he passed away, remaining a man. That was my ability. After that I was taken to "PALTus", and since then i watch human souls are drawn into oblivion. Youzo-san! I remembered... Incredible. Forget it for so many years ... Once a father ... told me to smile. But I couldn't. And then he ... mutated before my eyes ... And our whole family devoured by the creature he turned into. I wanted to smile ... I just couldn't. He became a monster and I killed him with my hand! Youzo-san! .. Do not. With this fault you barred from the world ... - But I killed him! - Does not matter! We must live on. You have to believe to the future. There the sky very blue ... This is a picture of rebirth. Now this future is the meaning of my life. Such a clear sky will one day be above us? I was not mistaken in you. I didn’t expect to see you so cheerful. Are you Yoshiko Hiiragi? Masao Horiki ... I repeat my invitation. I will make all the people "Lost" and destroy the SHELL. And then from the stored genes I will bring out a new humanity. This is the only way we can achieve so that people live on earth. You won't have time to create anyone! You will destroy civilization and die with it! The girl was out of luck. She's an experimental mouse puppet of old people. The future she believes in is a lie. Think by yourself: SHELL does not perceive Candidates as people! How does she know that the cultural outline reflects her hopes? I decided to believe her, Masao. Youzo-san! Fire! You have been well trained, Yoshiko Hiiragi. Youzo, give me your heart. Have you forgotten? My ability is to manage the "lost". Stop it! This is what I needed. Well done, Yozo. Now tear to pieces the woman how you killed Takeichi. Look you. Do not resist, you are my Orpheus! Kill this woman. Youzo-san, don't listen to his voice! Subject, don't bother me. Horiki! Now you won't leave. You have become old ... Will you let your princess be torn apart? Yoshiko! .. Tell your masters that the time has come. Do not dare! And that's it, Shizuko. I have worked unsuccessfully for decades Yozo came - and in a moment everything was ready. Probably life is like that. I even envied him. Look, the scar is not fading. It looks like the Candidates don't live forever either. I only have this barbaric method. I'm ready to go to hell. However, I've been there for a long time. Sleep well, Shizuko. NOTEBOOK THREE The heart has regenerated. And I don't see his soul. UNTIL THE DAY OF COMPLETENESS 1 DAY The day of usefulness is already tomorrow. I must definitely take Youzo there. You lured Horiki so well and I panicked and was stupid ... Your intuition was correct. We were surrounded by a blue sky ... And the third cultural circuit converged with the contour of the revival. Then even the director decided set the conditions to Full. The problem is Masao Horiki. Yes. Probably he will appear in person to destroy the SHELL. Right during the ceremony. We're on alert but you can expect anything from him. What about Ooba? I will try to enter with another It's not safe. I will kill Horiki even if I die myself. Is it true that Youzo Ooba will never wake up? Yes. All the resources of my organization are thrown into then to wake him up. Only this is what I hear from you. But we doubted is it correct to recognize it as Full ... The day of usefulness is tomorrow. To ensure the health of the people and security, we need a backup plan. Backup plan? But the point is that at this very moment Yoshiko Hiiragi with a group of employees trying to tap into Ooba's personality. Peak of positive dynamics in the cultural context definitely influenced by Ooba. Since the third Candidate appeared, we are getting smaller every day. Is there a connection? Please give me time to look into the matter. - Sibuta! - I'm listening. You apparently did not realize the seriousness of the situation. Who do you think we are? We are a model of health and happiness for the whole nation, a specially selected standard of usefulness. Now I am quite aware of this ... We have very little time left. Don't let us down. Specific images appeared. Indicators Ooba and the cultural outline is stable. Can you continue? Sure. Further you will find yourself in depth. If we decide that your personality dissolves, we'll get you out. Yes. As i thought for Youzo, that fateful day continues. Youzo-san ... He listened to me! “Yoshiko, it's me. - Director? I terminate the experiment. But why? Ooba-san doesn't reject me! A bit more!.. Youzo Ooba ... will be disassembled into organs, it is decided. Yozo Ooba declared dead, and we will combine it with the Complete by transplantation. Priority of the third Candidate at the cellular level will be recorded in the health standard. Why?.. Not. I disagree! Youzo, smile. Smile, I said. Smile! Shut up! Smile, Youzo. Why should I smile ?! Yoshiko! .. Finally I found you ... And I again ... Youzo-san, I wanted to say goodbye to you. Say goodbye? Please write my portrait. I can not. I can't do it anymore. Do not be afraid. You always believe in yourself, and into humanity ... I envied it. It was empty faith. I hid behind her from myself. But I was deceived. It turned out that I am one dozen I suffered for years for the future. I understood that. And it rose in my soul black-black wave. The first time I seriously felt that I have a soul. So I'll give it to you, Youzo-san. Even now clear sky above you. This hope is yours a parting gift for me. Now I saw you smiling. I'll wait, when you build your world. I will wait forever. Yoshiko! Are you awake? Where did you go? What did you do with Yoshiko? Did they do something to her? Today is a joyful day which are few in the history of mankind. Thanks to the system health care SHELL I can greet those gathered here anniversaries who have stepped over the milestone of 120 years, and bring them my sincere congratulations. Today you are leaving the SHELL program and go to the final stage life, each leaning on himself, but thereby your great work HAPPY ANNIVERSARY! ... will receive an individual completion, and today we are celebrating your first step towards this. I am very grateful to you. Together with my pension it turns out three hundred million, my heirs will be able to settle Inside. We gave you our lives for a reason. ... managed to re-use the pension system. The amount of the pension for each citizen ... Youzo, are you awake? But you can't stop us. Yoshiko, come back! Where is Yoshiko now? Its time has come. - What does it mean? - She herself decided what will become an organ donor for transplant instead of Ooba. I volunteered to extend the life of old people, for Ooba to be ranked among the High-grade for this. Bastard! So you sacrificed Yoshiko to the old man? Didn't even flinch took away everything the poor girl had! Well, Yoshiko Hiiragi, are you ready? Yes. Let my body be in charge our society and all of you.
