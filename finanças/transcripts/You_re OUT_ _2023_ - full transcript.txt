Baseball is life. Opening day brings the birth of a new season... ...and the hope and promise of spring. The season blossoms under the summer sun, filling afternoons and evenings with hours of pleasure. And a little pain. If you're lucky, you'll hit some homeruns. And who knows, maybe even pitch a no-hitter. Go, go, go, go, go! You're out. But the thing is, at some point, we all strike out. Browning! Yeah? What's up? They're calling you up, kid. They want you in Boston today. -Are you serious? -Yeah. Now, I know you're having a hard time flying, 'cause your parents died in that plane crash. -But you gotta go. -Okay. Don't fuck this up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can do this. They'll take the edge off, but remember, just take one. I can't do this. We're now boarding rows 30 to 40. Rows 30 to 40, please report to gate E. Browning! You piece of shit. You missed your flight? You're no closer. You know what you are? You're useless, like a limp dick. Wait, wait, wait. What? Like a limp dick! So, I never made it to the majors like I promised my dad, but I found a way to stay close to the game. I have a son who's better at baseball than I ever was. Hey, Joe. I want you to use that new bat tonight. The Merino? Yes, sweetie. I have a really smart daughter, too. She takes after Simone, my wife. Simone says I push Joe too hard, that I should stop trying to make him into a mini-me, but she doesn't understand. He's better than me. He's the major league me. Mom, this is great. You added nutmeg, didn't you? Yes, I did. Thank you, Joe. That was a really good idea. And if I get picked for Lobster Tank... I'm using this recipe. Well, then I suspect Kurt Granite will have you sipping champagne with investors. Well, it would be nice to make a living off my culinary degree. Okay, well, the lemon poppy seed is perfect. But when you're on the show, you've got to arrange the stalks like this. That's how Kitty Corba does it. A little lemon, just for good measure. Joe, stop playing with your food. Here. Show me your swing. Come on. Follow through, Joe. Honey, I got this. Joe, you gotta follow through. Here. Come on, I'll show you. Come on. Come on. Isabel, why don't you tell me about Jackson? Well, he's really smart and he's really cute. Well, that's good. I'm gonna go grab my purse. Come on, Rod. Jackson's here. Rod! Rod! Rod! What? Isabel's date is here. Have fun, Izzy. See? It's all about follow-through. Don't you want to come meet him? Is he on the baseball team? Nice follow-through, Dad. Oh, you know what? I wouldn't have had to do that, if you'd have fucking swung it like a man. And how do you lose a fucking loaf of bread? I don't know. Maybe if you pitched me some garlic, I could practice my batting. Oh, my God. - Hello. - Come on in. Good evening, Mrs. Browning. I'm Jackson. Oh, thank God, you're a geek. -Excuse me? Oh, I said, oh, my God, you're so sweet! Go ahead. Come on up. Take the stupid bread. I think you should have your sister teach you how to do a follow-through. - Hello, Isabel. - Hey, Jackson. Joe, it's time to go. -Mr. Browning? -He wishes. Mr. Browning, I'm Jackson. Isabel and I are in chemistry club together. Well, there will be no chemistry tonight. Dad. Why don't you two get going before you miss your movie? Bye. Have fun! Not too much fun. Joe, I'll be down in a sec. So, you coming tonight? Uh, yeah, I'll-- I'll be there a little bit later. We got a work thing to do. You know, you two never told me about your new business. -Oh, it's a baseball thing. -It's an internet thing. -Uh, on the internet. -About baseball. Uh... I-- it's cool. Just, uh, don't be too late, all right? All right. You save me a seat. Okay. So, babe, I got a good lead on a job. Alex is hooking me up with this guy that he knows, that owns a bunch of jewelry stores. Hello. I hope so. It's been six months. I'll get this one. I promise. Well, the producer from Lobster Tank emailed me again. Great. Hopefully, I'll get picked for the show. I can't do this forever. I mean... you could, if you wanted to. Mm, stop! We have to get busy. Oh, I'd like to get busy. Trust me. Mm! Who would've thought we'd make so much money selling porn. Me. That's why I suggested it. I know. The thought of all those men gawking at you. Ew. It's not just men. Thirty-three percent of our subscribers are women. Hmm. Well, that I don't mind. I do. I don't want someone from the PTO finding out that I'm doing porn. There's no way those PTO moms are watching this. You'd be surprised. I would be surprised. Hmm. Right. In five, four, three, two. Welcome to the Boob Ruth show, where the fans always score. Today, I'll be demonstrating a double play and a head-first slide. All right, fellas, listen up. As you know, I've been searching far and wide for a new travel coach for you boys. Someone with experience and heart. Well, I found someone. At least with, uh, a lot of experience. Welcome Coach Hurley. Boys. You're here today, because you're the best of the best. The cr√©me de la crap. Enough talk. Let's hit our balls. I've seen better arms on a beanbag chair. Hey, we could arrange a funeral for your dead arm. I've seen better pitchers at a Tupperware party. That's him. So, uh, what's the new coach like? I've seen more heat in a toaster. He's a bit... unenlightened. You couldn't hold your dog's lead. Unenlightened? -Yeah. -Cut the bullshit, Alex. What's he like? - He's a leathery old asshole. - Mm. All right, guys. Wrap her up. Everybody go grab some chair. Looks like he missed the MeToo movement while coaching at Tempe University. All right. Everybody settle. We got a lot of talent on this team and I am extremely confident we're gonna have a winning season. Yeah. Whoo-hoo. Now, that bastard of a new head coach at TU says I can bring two people to his showcase. So, I choose, uh, the pitcher with the dreamy blue eyes, and, uh, pretty boy catcher. Yes! I-- I'm the pretty boy dad. Oh. Well, if it isn't Rod Browning. I thought I recognized that kid's arm. Let me guess. Your life has amounted to nothing. So now you live bi-curiously through your son. I-- I think the word you're looking for is "vicariously." - That's what I said. - Yeah. Right. Hey, did you know your friend fucked up our chances to be in the bigs? Rod's moved on now. He's got his own very successful business. And here's something you'll appreciate. His wife is hot. Yeah. Well, maybe she can fly the kid to Arizona for the showcase, because I assume that you're still too much of a limp dick. No. Actually, I'll be the one taking Joe to the showcase. Well, maybe he can close when it counts. Grimy old bastard. I hate that fucking... Congratulations. Whatever, let's go. Fuck, I wish that guy -would fucking die. -Good job. Asshole! "Limp dick." "Limp dick." That's all I hear. Constant loop in my brain for years. Thank you so much. Oh, fuck Hurley. He's an asshole. But, maybe it's karma he's coaching our kids. Yes. Yes! -You're a fucking genius. -Mm. This will be my opportunity to show Hurley and the rest of the world and everybody else, my dick can get as hard as anybody else's. Yes! You have a hard dick! Thank you, buddy. - Mm. - Come here. Next week, we take the kids to Arizona, and you'll show Hurley once and for all, that you have got what it takes to close the deal. That's right. I do. He's gonna see it. Mm-hmm. Good beer. This is good beer. Hey, guys. Joe, Izzy! Remember, you're taking the bus home today. You're lingering, Simone. There's no lingering in the carpool lane. Mm. Hey. Sorry about last night. Oh, don't worry about it. You scraped me up off the floor many times after Tracy left. So, have you talked to her recently? Yeah. I saw her this morning at yoga. She wants to fix me up with her new boyfriend's sister. Did you tell her to shove it? Not exactly. What did you say? "Thank you." Getting a date at 40 is brutal, man, it's-- We're having dinner at that new restaurant on Saturday. Ooh, Saturday? We'll be on the road to America's favorite college baseball stadium. We're not driving, Rod. I bought the plane tickets last night, remember? No, I didn't agree to that. -Yes, you did. -When? Between the tequila and the Sambuca shots. -Mm. Sambuca. -Uh-huh. I thought that was our waitress's name. -And that's when we got cut off. -Ah, doesn't matter, man. I can't fly. Besides, how much fun would it be to do an old-fashioned father-son road trip, huh? I don't have that kind of time. Oh, come on, man! It's only a week. I'll cover for you, sir. Uh, see? Creepy eavesdropping guy. He's got your back. Your company will be fine. Well... at least if we drove, I'd be able to bring Mulder. Nope. No dogs. You know, you got a lot of baggage. No planes, no dogs. I haven't even told you the best part. Wait, let me guess. Simone has a twin sister named Sambuca. -No. -Oh. I found another showcase to take the boys to. -It's on the way. -You're nuts. We're not gonna have time for that. It's at MU. We can finally take our boys to check out our alma mater like we always said we would. And I called the SIG House. They're expecting us. Shuck corn, Matterhorn. I must be crazy for even considering driving. Great. Then it's settled. We leave Saturday. In five, four, three, two. Ladies, looks like today is gonna be dedicated to the fine art of pinch hitting. Ooh. It looks like we might go into extra innings. Now, some of you may have big barrels... and some of you may not. But take it from Boob Ruth, as long as you have wood, you can score. And that's why they call me the Sultan of Squat. Shit! It's okay. Cut. Hey. I'll edit that last part. Don't worry about it. No, don't use that one. Stop! Crossed the line, even for us. Oh, I mean... you didn't use the tiny baseballs. - Rod. - Fine. I'll keep it just for me. -Rod! -Okay, I'll delete it. There. Boob Ruth is officially retired forever. Yes. It is time to move on. Oh, I bet the kids missed the bus. Hmm. Oh-- oh, my God. Um, Lobster Tank, they want to interview me in person. Simone, that's amazing. I have so much to do before next week. Speaking of next week, do you remember Coach Hurley? Yeah. -He's Joe's new coach. -What? I-- I thought he was at TU? What's he doing here coaching a high school team? He's washed up. This is probably the best gig he could get. Serves him right. I hate the power he has over you. It's all right. I'm gonna put him in his place. And I'm gonna put you in yours. Kids won't be home for ten more minutes. Apparently, he somehow still has pull at TU. I mean, he hand-selected Joe for this tryout. Yeah. I'm gonna show him what Browning men are really made of. But Arizona, Rod? Yeah. Me and Alex, we're gonna drive the boys, -save some money. -Tyler got invited, too? Of course he did. He's almost as good as Joe. I mean, I taught him everything he knows. Mm. Like humility? Simone, this is a big deal. This is the best program in the country. We can't afford not to send Joe. He could get a full ride if they like him, which they will. I thought full rides were rare. Not for me. I-- I mean, not for Joe. I mean, look at us. We're making pornos in our bedroom. And not even good ones. While you live out your unfulfilled dreams through our son. All right. That's not fair. I fulfilled one of my dreams when I married you. You're unbelievable. You didn't even hear a word I said. You don't even care about my good news. That's not true. That-- that's amazing. It really is, and I'm happy for you. It's just-- I finally got a chance to set things right. Yeah. I wish my parents could have seen Joe play. I-- he's so much better than I was. When is this showcase? We leave Saturday. But Joe has school next week. Honey, the kid's getting straight A's, he can afford to miss a few days. But what about next weekend? You do remember what next Saturday is. Yeah, of course. What is it? You know, it's the, uh, it's the thing. The, um... anniversary. It's Isabel's birthday. Right. I-- I know that. That-- I meant it's the anniversary of Isabel's birth. If you're not back in time for her party... I promise, I'll be back. And you need to show more interest in Isabel's life. Yeah, you're right. And when I get back, I promise it's gonna be all about Isabel. The Izmeister. Fine. You can go. But this is it. Yes, this is it. Starting now, Joe decides what he wants to do with his life. He decides where he wants to go to college and what he wants to do with the rest of his life. He wants to play baseball. Rod. Okay. Done. And it would be nice if you'd pay a little bit more attention to me, too. Oh, that part is easy. Mom, we're home. Shit. You're the one that wanted to have kids. Where is it? Right, let's get going here. -Joe put your bag in. -I can't find my big barrel. Oh, here it is. You're gonna do great. I love you. Izzy. Oh! I promise I will be back in time for your party. Unless baseball, right? Wild horses couldn't keep me away. -What about the Cubs? -No. -Tigers? -Nope. -Diamondbacks? -Izzy. I promise I'll be back, okay? The show's gonna love you. Just remember the nutmeg. I will, I promise. - Love you, honey. - Love you, too. - Hey, good luck next week. - Thank you. Oh, hey, have fun at band camp. I don't play an instrument, Dad. I think you mean bonds camp. Ah! Chemistry humor. -I get it. -No, Dad. It's a camp at the animal shelter for socializing dogs. And speaking of which, there is this one really cute dog. Hey. Ew. Gross. Stop. Dude, you have wiener sauce all over you. No dogs. But I promise I will give you something very special -for your 14th birthday, okay? -Dad. -Really, Rod? -What? - It's her 15th, Dad. - Fuck! 15th! 15th birthday. I'm sorry, honey. I'll bring you two presents, I promise. -Nice. -Oh, Jennifer! You're lingering. Shoo! -Be nice. -No, fucking-- Shuck corn, Matterhorn. You ready for this? - Oh, I'm so ready. - What do you got here? Oh, nice. You got it mapped out already. Yeah, I'm good. Hey, man. Seriously, Tyler? What, these are not enough? Dude, we're gonna be playing baseball, like, the whole time. Oh. That's fine. I have a quick pop time anyways. Okay, I'd-- I'd keep that to yourself. Oh, there you go. And you know me. Once we hit the open road, I'll make it up. -Yeah, I know you will. -All right. - Cool. Let's hit it. - For sure. You forgot your lucky ball, Joe. Right here, Izzy, okay? Oh, crap. You throw harder than Joe. I heard that. Hey, this is just like the movie. Animal House? What a classic. No, no, not that. What's it called, Dad? I don't know what you're talking about, Ty. It was the second one down on your saved list. Um, Slutty Sorority something? I told you not to play with my laptop, Tyler. I wasn't playing with your laptop. I was watching pornos with it. I am so winning a parenting award. You know what I'm talking about, right, Dad? It-- it's right in between Star Wars and-- and Boob Ruth. - Can't forget that one. - What? Damn it! What did you say, Tyler? Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Be more careful, Rod! - I gotta be more careful? - Yeah. What about you, Mr. Security? Mr. Parental Controls? Fucking guru tech guy? I mean, isn't this what your company does? We gotta do something about this alarm. Can you do anything to shut it off? Check the manual. Maybe there's something in there. There isn't anything in the manual for the alarm. Oh, that engine light says that your-- your car needs immediate assistance. Ah, I've been driving like that for months. It's fine, I don't care about it. Well, that's comforting. No, I-- I got this. Ooh. - Hey. - Nice. All right! Ready to check out the house, boys? Huh? Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug! Oh, they got a wall of fame. Well, there you are, right there. Yeah. And there's, uh, there's me over there. Hey, who the-- Are you Rod Browning? Yes, I am. I'm Steaz McGoo, man. I'm your biggest fan. -I can't believe you're here. -Good to meet you, Mr. McGoo. -Hell of a game you had. -Yeah? Yeah, it was. It was a great game. Oh, you were-- you were there, too? -I was, I was. -Oh, you know, that's cool. The Foo-bees still keep score for us. Christ, 25 years later, and you still think I was a Foo-bee? I'm a SIG, like you guys. It's just-- you look a little, uh... Uncoordinated? I was a statistician, not the scorekeeper. Ah, and you wonder why people still refer to you as a Foo-bee? Shuck corn, Matterhorn! Ah, let's meet your friends. All I'm saying is, I wouldn't trust my husband. You don't have a husband. Well, when I did... I wouldn't trust him on an all-guys road trip. Lisa, he's with Joe. I'm just saying, you never know. You know what? I'll prove it to you. Shit, Tyler's turned off his location. Shit! I'm sure they're just out of cell range. Uh-huh. Put your finger over a little bit like that... - Rod! Rod! - Come on. Oh, what's up, man? Joe's been texting me. You're not picking up your phone. Oh, shit. Apparently, they went over to the Double O house. -Now Joe can't find Tyler. -Ah, Double O's. -Love 'em. Love 'em. -Yeah. I hope they brought some condoms. Condoms? The Double O's aren't gonna sleep with a high school kid. -Are they? -Really? Double O's will sleep with anybody. That was not my experience. Let's forget about your inability to get laid, Alex. This is about the boys and Tyler's hormones, which is gonna screw up our boys' future. -We gotta go find them. -All right. Work on that back, right? Oh, yeah. See what I'm talking about? Well, at least they're being safe about it. God, I don't even remember the last time I used one of these. What are you smelling it for? -It's-- -Pretty disgusting. Oh, shit, it's Simone. Don't answer it. I've gotta take this. I've ignored her last three calls. -No, no. Don't do it. -I got it. - Fuck! - Oh, your shirt. Are you kidding me? Goddammit. Oh. I'll go find Tyler. - Hi, honey. - Where are you? Rod? Uh, a restaurant. - Where? - Uh, hm, in Kansas? Oh, you're not in Kansas anymore, Mr. Gray. The fuck? Who was that? The waitress. Why aren't you or Joe answering my calls? Oh, you like it spicy? - Rod? - Oh, sorry, babe. Um, we need to order now. Can I call you later? What is going on, Rod? Nothing, she's, uh, trying to get me to try the house special. I like yours much better. I'm calling Joe. Um, yeah, so, uh... do you have something to drink maybe? Or, uh, something... I've got plenty. Oh, great, so I'm gonna just go sit right there... -Plenty. -...on the couch, and... Oh, oh, oh. Rats. -Joe, don't answer. -It's mom. -Hey, Mom. -What's going on, Joe? Uh, we're just, uh, having some food. Uh, and then we're going right to sleep. We have to be there by eight. But the showcase isn't until Wednesday. -It's MU's. -MU? I mean, we're safe? Your father's right there coaching you what to say, isn't he? Put him on the phone, Joe. Okay. Hi, honey. I should've known you would go to MU. No, no, no, it's-- we were just passing by. -That's all. -Great. Let me guess. You're at the SIG house. No, no, we're just, we're eating and we're going straight to bed. I knew I shouldn't have let you go on this trip, Rod. Simone. I promise you, we're not doing anything wrong. Would you-- Simone? Great. Your mother hung up on me again. Uh, safe? You were giving me the signal for safe. No, no, this is the safe signal. This means no. And this is a fucking idiot. Put down the fucking knife. You're a pitcher. What if you fuck your hand up? -I'm not 12. -Oh, my God. Take this. -Thanks. -Let's go. - Oh, my God. - Shit. No, you are the dumb ass here. Tyler? Tyler! Are you in there? I'm knocking down the door. Oh, oh, oh. Maybe I was a Foo-bee in college. Dad! What are you doing here? For the love of Mother Teresa, you just met her. Okay. But you don't have to worry, all right? She already signed this. You slept with 12 women? Who told you that they were all women? Jesus, Mary and Joseph. We're getting out of here. Let's go. Oh, come on, you're ruining my top. See, this is why we can't have nice things. That's it. Top's up the rest of the trip. Maybe I was mistaken thinking you two could handle a college campus. Yeah. You may be right. I only brought enough for maybe half. -What? -Nothing. Uh, yep. We are sorry, and we know we are not ready for this. You gotta remember that college is about learning responsibility. We know. Your education is your top priority. And baseball. Which is why we got to get you two clowns to bed. That is fine by me. I'm exhausted. Well, I can't imagine why? I can't believe my son has slept with more people than me. No, come on, man. -That's not true. -Yes, it is. What about those exchange students? Sophomore year. That's two right there. That was you, Rod. Oh. Yeah. Oh. How about that night the cheerleader's bus broke down, huh? It's you again. Oh, right, right. Well, you were married to a beautiful woman for 18 years. Who now wants me to date her boyfriend's sister. Yeah, you're right. We gotta do something about this. Well, I am doing something. I'm looking for the meaning of life. Ah. And I'm watching some porn. You ought to check out this Boob Ruth, man. She is so hot. Welcome to the Boob Ruth Show. -Where the fans always score. -Did you hear that? No, I keep the volume down cause she can get kind of loud. No, no, no. Stop with the porn. I'm talking about in the bush. Did you hear something? You're starting to freak me out here, man. Yeah. What do you say we get some tots and call it a night? -I do love the tots. -Mhm-hm. Why the hell did you get so much food? Sorry, buddy. No worries. I'll just drown my sorrows in a new episode of Boob Ruth. No. Simone? No, it's not Simone. Getting all these updates on our website. I gotta take a look at this. Yeah, me too. Whoa, damn. You gotta see this. Boob Ruth's using the big barrel. Wait a second. Isn't that Joe's bat? Look, that's his initials right there. -All right. Give me-- -Wait a minute. Just give me your phone. Is this the internet business that you and Simone have been doing? Oh, goddammit. Simone's gonna kill me. -Simone is Boob Ruth? -Let's go. Shit. You cannot tell anyone. My obsession with Boob Ruth now makes total sense. My wife, Alex. You can't talk about my wife like that. -It's fucked up. -Fucked up? What are you talking about? You're making pornos with your wife. We were desperate. The bills were piling up. We needed the money. The divorce tapped out all my cash but give me a few days and I can get you some money. No, no, I don't want you doing that. Let me help you. You've always had my back. Well, apparently I could have hooked you up with more chicks. Well, that's true. But Tyler wouldn't be half the ballplayer he is if it weren't for you. I appreciate it, man. I really do. But I'm gonna get this new job next week and we're gonna be fine. Guaranteed. You're the man. Oh, grimy little dog. Give me your mace. I don't carry it anymore. Gave me bad energy. Besides, he looks friendly. Come on, boy. Here boy. - That's it. - Don't feed it. We're never gonna get rid of it. We can't just leave it out here. I'm taking him to the hotel. No, you're not. Somebody must be looking for him. I'll check the lost dog website. Maybe he's just lost his collar. He's not sleeping with me. He's probably got fleas. Come on, dog. Come on. Yeah, come on. Does he have fleas? No, but he's a she, so you don't have to worry about her blowing her load all over you. Well, that's good. It doesn't seem that anyone's looking for Matterhorn. I'll call in the morning. Wait, you named her Matterhorn? You know your name already? Hm. You're pretty smart. Pretty cute too. Izzy would love you. I gotta be a better dad to her. This is Izzy. She's beautiful, strong, smart. Just like Simone. Honestly, I don't deserve either of them. Rise up boys. Time to shine. You're not ready. We don't have to be there till 8:00, Dad. 8:00 is for slackers. Matterhorn time is 7:00. What she said? - Who's the pup? - Is Tyler ready? Almost, give us 15 minutes. All right, hurry it up. Meet us down by the car. Go. Wake up. I feel sick. -I like your dog. -Oh, thank you. We're fostering her. No, we're not. We're taking her to a shelter. I called the shelter. No one's been looking for her. So they asked us to foster her for a few days until something opened up in the kennel. I didn't sign up for this, Alex. Yes, you did. We would have never found her if we had flown. Fine. All right. We got a few players helping out today. Pitchers, stay with me, catchers with Coach Olson. Position players out on the field. Let's go. All right arms, you're facing the top of the order. So, Latner, we've got Jackson, we got McGoo and we've got Big Danny Kelly. You're gonna figure out which one he is. All right. Go out there and loosen up, guys. Let's go. Hey, your dad's Rod Browning, right? Yeah. The guy is a legend around here. -Yeah. -By the way, you go against Kelly, he can't hit the curveball to save his life. -Really? -Makes him look like a fool. Every time. Trust me. Browning, get on the bump. Kelly, grab a bat. You're up next. Foul ball. The hell's wrong with these guys, man? I know Tyler's hung over. Joe's playing like his head's up his ass. But that's no excuse. Dude, you can't throw another fastball. -This guy's gonna crush it. -He just got lucky. It's not gonna get by me. Dude, did you see what he did to the last fastball? Tyler, I got this. Okay. Go ahead, Joe. Kiss the Blarney stone. -What the fuck? -Do it. Bush league. Ooh. Well, we fucked that one up. Hey, I know you don't really give a shit anymore about this stuff, but I still do. -Yeah? -Yeah. Then why did you get lit last night? Touch√©. But it's not happening ever again. Let's go. We're coming. God. Just hurry up, Tyler. Shit. You two really screwed the pooch today. No offense, Matterhorn. Hey, Rod, you're the one getting the ticket here. Not us. Hey, Tyler. You're the one that smells like shit here. Not us. I told you I was sick. That's why we sucked today. You were hungover. That's why you sucked today. I think it's Matterhorn that stinks. I gotta get her some real food. Hey, we need food too. After that piss poor performance today, I don't think either of you deserve food. Bars with benefits. All right, shh, shh. Guys, not a word of this to Simone. -Hi, honey. -Hi, baby. How's everything going? Good. Great. Awesome. Good. Where are you? Uh, we're driving into Oklahoma as we speak. Land of the Sooners. Uh, you know how fast you were going? Rod? Did you just get pulled over? About, uh, 75, sir? I'll tell you what. For $100 we can overlook your alternate view of reality. See, dogs like Gigi here, they need a new collar. -Hm. -Oh, my God. Are you bribing a cop? Let me, uh, let me get that for you. Yeah. Thank you. Animal welfare. Good cause. - Great cause. - Hm-mm. -Hello? -Have a good day. -You as well. -Thank you. Hello? Rod? Hi, honey. Sorry about that. E-everything's great. How's it going over by you guys? Yeah, everything is fine here. I just called because I need advice from Alex -on what computer to get Izzy. -Oh. She's been making a lot of videos lately. -Is he right there? -Yep. Hey, Boob. What did you say, Alex? I-- I-- I said, hey, noob. Izzy needs about 16 gigs of RAM in order to edit her videos, noob. Was that a dog? No, no, of course not. That's, um, that's Tyler. I think he picked something up - at MU. - Shut up. Come on now, I always wear a condom. What? -What? -Shh. What is going on there? Nothing, everything's great. Everything is good to go. We are... Oh shit. We got a flat tire. I knew you shouldn't have taken this trip. You've got exactly four days to make it back in one piece. That won't be a prob-- Hello? Shit. There's gotta be an auto repair place somewhere around here. No, fuck that. We don't have time. I'll go and do it myself. You guys, you know, relax. You can't make it all the way to Arizona - on the spare, Dad. - Watch me, son. I don't wanna look too sexy. Hey, whatever it takes. And besides, that host is hot. Oh, I love his Australian accent. This is serious. Kurt Granite is one of the most innovative chefs ever. Well, maybe he'll take you down under. Lisa, I'm married, happily married. I know. I'm sorry about that. All I'm saying is a little innocent flirting can't hurt. Wear that shirt you wore on New Year's Eve. That is way too low-cut. Simone's Sauces can stand on their own. No cleavage required. Suit yourself. I will. - Hey, buddy. - Hey, man. Thanks again for getting this done so quickly. -Sure, yeah, no problem. -Appreciate it. -It's a big day for the boys. -She's all yours, ready to go. Thank you. All right, we'll see ya. Well, it looks like things are getting done. Yeah, looks like it. You know, I gotta hand it to him, no matter what happens, he always seems to be able to land on his feet. ] Yep, in spikes that I'll never fill. Look, Joe. Your dad never expects you to do-- Are you kidding? The only thing my dad cares about is me playing baseball. Oh, okay. Maybe. But it is your decision. Yeah, it sure doesn't feel like it. Hey, what's going on here, Rod? We're good to go, brother. Now we can head to America's favorite college baseball stadium. But watch this. Ready? Yeah. Shuck corn, Matterhorn Oh, nice. Yeah. Not bad, huh? All right, let's hit it. Hold on, let me take Matterhorn for a quick walk -before we check into the hotel. -All right. Let's do it. Let's go, Matterhorn. Here we go. Time to do your business. Yeah. Come on. Oh, my God. She's so cute. -Can I pet her? -Yeah, sure. She's super friendly. Oh, what's her name? -Matterhorn. -How long have you had her? Uh, we just got her, in fact, I think she's a stray. Oh, are you gonna keep her? I can't, my dog at home only likes human companions. What about you? You have a dog? But my ex got to keep her. Oh, I'm so sorry. Me too, cause I'm lost without her. I can't imagine. I'd be devastated if something happened to Mulder. Mulder? As in Fox? Yes, nobody ever gets that. -My dog's name is Scully. -No. -Are you serious? -Hm-mm. -Um, Alex, not Fox. -Brenna, not Dana. - Oh, shit. - Oh, man. You mind if I take a look at it? Well, the good news is, it still works and you can get the screen replaced pretty easily. Hm, not on my budget. I guess I'll just read between the cracks. Looks like you're planning some trips to Chicago. Yes. Big wedding weekend. Oh, you're getting married? No. No, my friend, I designed her dress. -You're a designer? -Aspiring. Oh, wow, that's great. My friend has a kiosk in the mall and she lets me sell a few of my things there. I love it. Well, I'm stuck in retail right now. You'll get there. I have a business in Chicago and it's just hard. Maybe I can fix your phone when you get to the wedding in Chicago. I wish. But I can't afford to go. I'm sorry to hear that. Me too. Alex. That's my friend. We're taking our two sons to try out for the TU baseball team tomorrow. You have a son? Yeah, but not a wife, in case you were wondering. I was kind of curious. Alex! Sounds like you need to go. Well, it sure was nice meeting you. Nice meeting you, too. Let me give you my number in case you do make it to Chicago. Oh, here, hold on, let me get that. Oh, Saint Francis of Assisi. Oh my God! Matterhorn! What? Rod? Oh, Rod. Let's go. Come on, Alex, move your ass. What the hell did you do? Fuck. Put on your seatbelt, okay? How could they just disappear like that? They were right there in front of us. I was going as fast as I can. What do you want me to do? - Calm down, we'll find her soon. - I just put the leash down for a second so I could get untangled. I wanted to give Brenna my phone number. So you were thinking with your dick? That's what you were doing. Joe, do you see anything? I can't see anything. -Do you see anything? -Yeah, I think they turned. - They turned right here. - They turned right? - No, left. - I think they went right. No, come on, they went left. I swear, just go. You-- you do it. I'm not making this decision. I gotta go with my instincts. I think they went right. You never listen to me. Look, that's them, maybe... Fuck. Thanks for watching Lobster Tank, where we fund some of the most promising chefs around. Only if they can prove their pudding. And cut. You must be Simone. Your lemon poppy seed dressing was outstanding. Thank you, Mr. Granit. No, please, call me Kurt. Oh, and your marinara... Mmm! It was like being back in Florence. Did I detect nutmeg? Yes, you did. Thank you, mister-- Kurt. I-- I'm just as excited to be here. I don't know what to say. Well, say you'll be on the show. And I'll be honest with you. I'm not actually Australian. There's a lot of BS that goes along with being on the show. All those ridiculous tasks that we make contestants do for ratings... It's all worth it, though. Our last winner just opened a restaurant in Paris. Paris? Wow. I've always wanted to go. But you have to fly there. -Sorry? -Oh, never mind. Um, yes. Yes, I'd love to be on the show. I've got a great feeling about you, Simone. Your screen test was amazing. Best I've seen. Have you been on camera before? No, never. You're a natural, then. Thing is we're only here this week. So we have to start filming tomorrow. I'm sure you have a husband you need to check in with. No, I don't. I'm-- I'm in. Thank you for the opportunity. Hey, yeah. So what do you think? I think it was good. I think I could have hit the Lobster Tank a little bit stronger. There you go. Now, you're not gonna want to miss the mall. There's always some celebrity or another signing autographs. Last week was a David Hasselhoff impersonator. Mhm. There's an indoor merry-go-around. Mhm. We've got America's favorite college baseball stadium. Sorry, we're not that enthusiastic right now. To be honest, we're actually pretty bummed out because, well, our dog just ran away. She was probably dog-napped. That's terrible. Here. Call Animal Control. They'll help you. Thanks, I will. Come on. -This place looks pretty cool. -Mm. - Hi, baby. - Finally, I've been trying to get a hold of you. Rod, I got the job. I am so excited. Yes! Uh, me too. You got the job too? That's amazing. Uh, yeah. Well, when do you start? We-- we haven't set the start date yet, but we will soon. Uh, baby. I gotta go. I gotta get the rest of the groceries and Isabel needs a ride. I just wanted to call and tell you the good news! And congratulations on your job. Uh, thanks, you too. We'll celebrate when we get home. -Tell Izzy, I love her. -I will. You brought me a doggie bag. Alex! I'll be right out. I hired a psychic to help us find Matterhorn. No need. She's back. What you doing? That's you. What is he doing with all these pictures? Holy, merciful Buddha. Welcome back, Matterhorn. -Where have you been? -It's all coming together? Matterhorn's back. Simone got picked up for the show. I'm getting a new job and tomorrow our boys are gonna kick ass... ...at America's favorite baseball stadium. -Bam. -Ugh. It's all working, right, honey? This is working. Oh, it's all working. What's all this, dude? It's a little creepy. -What the hell is going on? -Where is everyone? Get out. There's a sign. Go read the sign. What's it say? Moved to Tempe High School. We're in the wrong place. I think it's over that way. Oh, come on. Come on, come on, hurry up. - All right. All right. - here, Matterhorn. - Okay, boys. - Just relax, we're here early, there aren't even any scouts here. This is what we trained for, all right? It's what we trained for. Let's get it! So much for America's favorite college baseball stadium. Honestly, I don't give a crap where they play as long as they get selected. Come on, Tyler, be ready, be ready now. Come on, Joe. Uh, you seen cheese better than that. You got it! Come on, Tyler, look alive out there. Get in there, Joe. You got this. Be ready now, be ready. Home run, baby. Come on. Fuck. - No! - I'm coming. - Stay down. - Oh, my God. Show me the hand. Is it your thumb? - You okay? - Show me the fingers. - Joe! Joe! - Hey, guys, -can you back up, please? -Joe. - Back up. - Are you okay? It's fine. It'll be okay. Ah, Joe, that's your pitching hand. - Are you his dad? - Yeah. I'm worried about a fracture. He needs an X-ray. Goddammit. They haven't seen him pitch yet. Sorry, Dad, shouldn't have batted. No, what you should have done is you should have swung at one of those first fucking two pitches. He was pitching, like, 95. You're doing fine, kid. He can handle the heat. He needs medical attention. - Goddammit. - Don't move it. - Hey, man. - Nice pitch, Pete. Fucking amateur. All right, hey, we're gonna run, get it checked out, we can still make it back in time before the end of the trial. All right? -Fucking clown. -The scouts come at noon. Let's go. Well, I'm afraid he fractured his thumb. -Dammit! -We set it, here. But your doctor back home will have to check it in about four weeks. Can he still pitch? I mean, Joe's gonna be playing in D1. Is that right, young man? That's what my dad thinks. I see no reason why his thumb won't heal properly. Oh, thank God. He'll be pitching, batting, chopping, whatever else he wants to do with his thumb. I'm sorry, chopping? You two need to talk to each other, and I'll be back in a few minutes. What's going on, Joe? Look, I-- I probably, should've told you this a long time ago, but, um... I-- I don't want to play baseball anymore. What? I can't believe this, Joe. Why? It just stopped being fun. I only play because it makes you happy. I can live with that. Seriously? No? Jesus Christ. Look, Dad, baseball is your thing. It's not mine. Fine. What's your thing? -Cooking. -Oh, dear God. -For the pain. -Oh, thank you. Uh, they're for your son, Mr. Browning. I knew that. Okay, you're good to go. Thank you. I-- I guess, as long as I'm being honest about baseball, I may as well tell you something else. Oh, what? That you're gay? Who cares? You're my son. I love you. And besides, maybe we can parlay the whole gay pitcher thing, and do a pretty sweet endorsement. Like, uh-- uh-huh. -Joe "The Flamer" Browning-- -Dad. Look, I get it you're trying to connect with me. It's great, but... you're not listening, okay? -So just give me my clothes. -Joe. Just give me my clothes, please. Thank you. Oh, fuck. So how's the thumb, Joe? Broken. Damn. That really sucks, man. Uh, it's no big deal. Joe doesn't need his thumb anyway. He doesn't want to play baseball anymore. Thumbs are good for more than just baseball, A-Rod. You know like cooking. Wait, did you know about him not wanting to play baseball? They're best friends, Rod. So I was the only idiot that didn't know this? Yeah, I would say pretty much. Hey. Quiet, Tyler. Let's go. Let's go! Come on, let's go. Come on. Uh, hey, Dad, there's-- there's malls up ahead. We still have to get Isabel's present. Shit, that's right. Eyes on the road. Oh. Oh, whoa, whoa, this is the call, guys. This is the call. All right. Um, get out, go, go, go, go, go. All right. All right. All right. Hi, this is Rod. Yes. Yeah. One second, please. I wanna pull over, so I can talk to you safely. Whoa, whoa, get something nice for your sister. - Okay. - Nice. - Nothing sleazy. - I got it. Hi. This is Rod Browning. Hey, Paul. Good to hear from you. Oh, no, no, that's unfortunate. Oh, come on, uh-- I'm telling you, I'm a quick learner. Who I really am? I mean, I know jewelry, Paul, I've been playing on diamonds for 20 years. No, I uh-- no, I understand. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll tell Alex that you said hello. Sure. All right, bye-bye. Goddammit, buddy. I don't understand. You can do everything the right way. Make all the right choices... and life will still give you a big, fat, steamy shit sandwich. Man, I've got no idea what to get Izzy for her birthday. Whatever you guys get her, she always loves it. I wouldn't stress that much. You're probably right. -Dude, I love Kitty Corba. -Who? She-- she's a reality cooking show star. Shit. Man, I've got to get her autograph. My mom will flip. Can you do me a favor? Tyler! Check out the hottie eating cinnamon pretzel. Man, that's a churro. I need you to focus. Okay look, I need you to get Izzy's gift, please. Something appropriate for a 15-year-old girl. Hey, Joe, relax for me, okay? You can count on me for this. Okay. Just spend whatever you want, he's being a dick. Will do. Oh. Oh, yeah. Ugh. Call security. We have another perv. Nice. No, I'll just talk to him. He's just a kid. Hi. Hello. Can I help you? Hi, um... Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. It's just-- you look really familiar. Have you ever done porn before? Oh, oh, I am definitely calling security. No, that's okay, I'll leave. My dad's already threatening to put a GPS inside me once we get back to Chicago, so... Chicago? Wait, is your dad's name Alex? Yeah! That's why you look so familiar. -You must be Brenna, right? -Yes. Okay, my dad's been stalking your social media for a long time now. - Really? - Yeah. Is he here with you? Yeah, he's just over there by the massage chairs. You should definitely come out and say hi. I would love that. Laura, can I take my lunch break now? Sure. If you want to lose your job. Bitch. Oh. Oh, I'm definitely calling some security now. You know what, Laura? You are a bitch. Oh, and I'm writing you up too. Don't bother. I quit. Let's go meet your dad. -Let me just grab my things. -You can't quit. We have a whole display to do still. -You can do it. -And hey, would it be okay if we took these wings with us? Of course you can, she doesn't pay me enough anyway. Speaking of, you're not gonna get it next week. You're never gonna get it again. Hey, A-Rod. So, our friend, Brenna, over here needs a ride to Chicago in order to make it to her friend's wedding. - Does she now? - Mm-hmm. - Mmm. - You cool with that? Sure. Why not? Let's add Brenna to the mix. Hop in, the water's warm. You know, I'm driving across the country so he could do something he doesn't even want to do putting my relationship with my wife and my daughter at risk, spending money with the job that I don't have... and it's the one day of the year in Arizona it just happens to be a fucking downpour. So, yes, I think it's a swell idea that we add Brenna to the mix. She could be the cherry on top of the bullshit sundae. Mmm. See? I told you he wouldn't care. He's not always such an asshole. Here's your wallet, Dad. Thanks, hope you guys don't mind... driving off the first cliff I see. Don't look at me like that. I know, I promised Simone we wouldn't use this episode. But if I don't, we won't be able to pay our mortgage next month. All I gotta do is just edit the last of the clip and-- Oh, hi, babe. How's the-- the Shrimp... ...uh, Pot thing going? Lobster Tank, Rod, and-- and it's good. I was just calling to see how you're doing. I know Joe's decision must be really hard on you. Uh, did you know too? Yes, it's been coming for a long time. How did I not see it? Because we see what we want to see? Honestly, right now, babe, I just want to see you. I can't wait to see you either. And don't worry, everything is gonna be okay. Brenna is a lingerie model. No, I just used to work there. Who's Brenna? Uh, it's just a friend of Alex's. Take it off. Take it off! What is a lingerie model taking off in your room, Rod? Uh, everything's under control, Simone. I-- I'll call you later. - Ooh, yeah. - Dude. What the hell? That sounded sketchy as fuck. -Is he always so angry. -Now Simone's pissed. -Brenna. Brenna. -No, no, no, no, no, no. You stay. I'll go ahead, and go. Just leave you lovebirds alone. -Thank you. -No problem! See you later, buzzkill. Now, where were we? Morning. Ah. Wake up, Dad. - Wake up, Dad. - No, no, I'm not a limp dick! Okay, I'm gonna pretend I did not hear that. We have to go. Oh. Oh, thank God. None of it was real. Ow! In my dream, you gave up baseball. Yeah, I did give up baseball. Come on, Joe! -What did I do wrong? -Nothing. Really? Okay, maybe, you pushed a little too much. I thought you loved baseball, like me. I do love baseball. I just don't want to do it forever. But you're so good. I don't want you to waste your talent like I did. I have other talents, Dad. I know. Did you think I forgot about your straight A's and your kick-ass sushi? Yeah. Well, I didn't. Well, you never acknowledge them. You're right. And I'm sorry about that. It's okay. I'm just glad that you understand I don't want to play. Whoa. I never said I understood. Really? I thought we were having a moment. Look. I get it here. Just not here. Not yet. So, I'm just gonna need a little time to... let this dream go for good. Sorry about Isabel's present. I probably shouldn't have trusted Tyler with that one. It's all right. Right, I should probably pick out Izzy's present myself anyway. - Hey, morning. - Join the party. Well, the shelter just called. They have room for Matterhorn now. Oh, that's, uh-- it's great. You-- you know, uh, we don't have time. I mean, if I'm not back within two days, Simone will disown me. Wh-- what do you think, do you know anyone that would want to adopt Matterhorn? I know someone who runs a rescue, but it usually, takes her months to place a dog that looks like Matterhorn. "Looks like--" what are you talking about? She's gorgeous. Look at the beautiful, dark, rich, black coat and the perfect white stripe on her chest. Don't you even get me started on those soulful brown eyes. She's a stunner, and whip-smart too, but people are gonna call her a pit bull. Pitbull? Like a... Pitbull! Pitbull? I mean, she never mauled my face like they say on the news. That's exactly what I'm talking about. They get a bad rep from ignorant people. Well, I may be ignorant, but I know better than to look a gift horse in the mouth. Right, Joe? Or something like that. All right, we gotta get going. Time to hit the road. Oh, we're not done talking. Okay. Well, Simone just finished her final Lobster Tank task. We're gonna tally up her customer's ratings, and find out next week if she's gonna be sipping champagne with investors, or getting boiled alive. Find out next time on Lobster Tank. Nice work this week, Simone. Oh, thank you. That pie challenge was a little touch and go, but I made it through okay. I still don't understand how blindfolding somebody and smashing pies in their face is a good indicator of how good of a chef they are. I agree. I think I still have meringue in my ear. Oh, really? Oh. -You're married. -Yes, for 19 years. But I thought you said you didn't have to check with your husband. I don't. I can make my own decisions, and I take my wedding ring off when I cook. So, sorry if you think I misled you. I'm married. Happily. Well, don't worry about me. I've got plenty of other shrimp on the barbie. But, uh, you hold on to my number. Just in case you change your mind. Oh, my Boob Ruth. Whew. Flick! I'm coming to get you, Boob Ruth. Ooh! Here comes your big barrel. Boob. Boob Ruth. Oh, Boob! That's right, boobies. Boobies. Boobies. Boob... Ruth. - Hi, babe. - Don't you mean Boob? No, of course not. What's wrong? Well, for starters, my husband is a lying sack of shit. The police were here tonight, Rod. What? Why? Because a pervert saw the latest video you posted and recognized me. Oh, I'll kill the bastard. You promised you wouldn't post that video. Oh, my God, it-- it must have posted by mistake. I am so sorry, Simone. Well, while you've been gallivanting across the country, I was being stalked. I'll kill the bastard. That bastard is already in the hospital. But it was your daughter who took care of him. - What do you mean? - It was Hurley. He was the Peeping Tom. That old fuck. He's ruining my life. You can't blame Hurley for everything. When he gets out, we're pressing charges. I'm calling a lawyer tomorrow. Good idea. I'm sure the jury will award me for pain and suffering for all these years of harassment. I'm calling a lawyer tomorrow... because I want a divorce. Hey, oh-- oh, what? Simone, honey... I-- I love you, wh-why would you say that? I'll explain it in terms that you understand. I'm tired of being benched, Rod. And so is Isabel. You can't get to Paris by train, Rod. I-- I'm so sorry, Simone, but... we're still a team. We were a great team until you couldn't get your head out of your ass. You don't even know how good you had it. No, Simone, not "had." I'm so sorry. I-- I-- I promise you I will make this up to you. -I'm tired of your empty... -No. ...sales pitches. Babe, tha-- tha-- that's only two strikes. I'm also tired of being lied to. You didn't get that job, did you? Strike three, Rod. You're out? No. Simone. Simone? Goddammit. - I'll be right back. - Buzzkill. Oh, man. I'm so sorry, Rod. In all these years, how come no one ever told me I was an asshole? What do you think the A in A-Rod stood for? Really? Holy shit. Well, we still wanted to be you, the golden boy, the man's man. - The asshole. - Oh, yeah. Until you met Simone. Well, I fucked that up. She hates me, man. It's over. Look, I can't save your marriage, but I can get Boob Ruth off the internet. What we need is a ninth-inning rally. I never even thought I would think about getting a divorce. Don't worry, I'll help you set up your Tinder profile. Oh, my God. I can't even deal with him right now. -I can't believe you, Rod. -Lisa? What were you thinking? Making Simone a porn star? -It was her idea. -Yeah, right. Anyway, it doesn't matter now. Kurt Granite is her knight in shining armor. You should be worried, Rod. Every woman wants a piece of his Kiwi ass. Please, let me talk to Simone. - I've gotta go. Simone needs me. - Lisa. Wait. Hello? What? "Wonder down under." Shit. Thanks for coming over. Bye. Hang on, Lisa. What'd you forget this time? I know I missed the last PTO meeting, but you really didn't have to go out of your way -to include me like this. -Save it, Simone. We're here to fire you from the PTO for conduct unbecoming of a parent. Really? And what conduct is that? -Porn. -Porn. You tainted the PTO's reputation. Well, why don't you tell me how you know what I'm doing in the privacy of my own bedroom? That filth is available for the whole world to see. Actually, it's not. It's a premium subscription service. FilthyMama13. That is your screen name, isn't it? - No, of course not. - Funny. That name on my site is attached to the same email that you used to send out all your wholesome PTO newsletters. Oh, no. You're all hypocrites. You're a puritanical PTO posse. And I know exactly who here is a subscriber. So, if you don't leave right now, I'm gonna start naming names. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Come on, boys, get at 'em. Rally time. I got a family to save. Ooh, Dad, did you get Izzy's gift? Yes, Joe, I got it while you were sleeping. All good. Shit. This is what I get for ignoring the check engine light. Oh, and of course... no fucking service in this godforsaken place. What's going on? Why did we stop? We broke down. Where are we? Lake Ka-ho. How the hell did we end up in California? We gotta get back to Chicago, man. Fucking Simone's gonna leave me for Crocodile Dundee. Don't worry. I'll call roadside. Good luck. I'm not getting any service. Shit. Me either. What are the fucking chances, man? We break down in the middle of bumblefuck. I can't get any cell service. Can my luck get any better? Actually, I'd say you're pretty darn lucky. Who the hell are you? Name's Wilson. And you're lucky 'cause you done broke down in front of the only auto repair shop in Lake Ka-ho. That's with a K. I can fix your car tomorrow. Thanks, but I need to be in Chicago in ten hours. I'll take care of it 'fore the rooster crows. Chicago is only five hours from here. Besides, you can crash in my Airbnb. Great. Morning. Morning. Is my, uh, car almost fixed? Nope. Turns out your luck's done run out. What now? You need a new doohickey. A doohickey? What kind of fake mechanic are you? The kind who can get you a doohickey. Well, see ya. Whoa, whoa, where you going? I'm going to get you a doohickey. Well, how long is that gonna take? Reckon an hour or so. Wilson, please hurry. I'm running out of time here. Ah, fuck. The hell was I thinking? That Joe just had to play in the bigs. Oh, I'm such an idiot. Snap out of it. This self-deprecating A-Rod sucks. I know. I suck. I'm an overweight, washed-up jock. I'm probably gonna have to move in with you and Brenna after Simone kicks me out. Simone's not gonna throw you out. You're A-Rod, you're the closer, you have to fight for her. You can do this. Even if Wilson got back right now, by the time he's done fixing the car, it'll be too late. It's over, man. It's over. Sorry for that delay, boys. Ah, Mr. Wilson. Do you happen to know if there's an airport -around here? -Yeah. -Small one. Just down the road. -Ah! -Do you know a pilot? -I reckon so. I flew over 300 missions in Nam. Excellent. Rod would like to ask you something. I-- I would? Excuse us one second. What? This is your last chance to save your marriage, Rod. Let Wilson fly you home. You know, I can't fly. Do it for Simone. For Simone. Oh, shit, you're right. I can do this. Yes, you can do this. - All right. - Come on, let's talk. Um, so, uh, a-- as a veteran, uh-- I thought you looked like military. -Oh, no, no. I meant-- -What squad were you in, son? -The 82nd. -Ah, airborne division? That's the one. Sure. So, uh, if it's not too much trouble i-if you could maybe fly me back to my loved ones, I would greatly appreciate it. Greatly appreciate it. You got it, son. - Yes! - Happy ending. I'll get the missus to fix the car. She's a much better mechanic than I am anyhoo. -Oh, great. -Ma? -That works out. -Yeah, Pa? Can I get you to work your magic on this fella's truck? Depends, on whether you want to work your magic on me later. Oh, always happy to oblige. Uh-- um, excuse me, I'm sorry. Um, I-- I don't mean to interrupt. Could you maybe postpone this magic until a little bit later? I-- I really got to go. We're in a bit of a rush here. - Here you go. - Thank you. -H-- h-- hop in. -Okay. Come on, girl, you're coming with, you're my closer. Okay, good to go. All right. Tell Joe I'll see him at home. I will. It's time to get your girls back. Yes. Shuck corn, Matterhorn! Do it. Save the day, Matterhorn. Good girl. Hey. How are you doing back there? -Good, considering-- -Considering what? I've never flown before. But you told me you were 82nd. Yeah, because I'm an asshole, and I needed to get home, so I won't be an asshole anymore. Yeah, you're in a pickle then. No, I'm-- I'm okay, I-- I can see the airport, so I know we're close. We-- we can't land there. Then where are you going to land? I'm not. You're jumping. Jumping? If you mean jumping for joy when this thing gets on the ground, then yep, I'll be jumping. No, I mean, jump as in skydive. This here plane's not cleared to land there. Information that would have been useful before we took off. Why didn't you tell me? 'Cause you told me you were airborne, figured you could handle a little 10,000-foot jump. Now, son. It's time to open that door. I'm not opening that door. You have to. There's no other way. I can't. What are you doing? Seriously? I can't do it. Turn around. If you're too scared, then I'll turn around. I'm not a limp dick. I'm not a limp dick. I'm not a limp dick. Wilson, turn around. I'll do it. I'll jump. Really? I have to. All righty, then. We are almost there. I'm sorry, Matterhorn. You probably would've been better off at the shelter. Jump, now! Now? Wilson! Hold tight, we're gonna be good. Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! We've made it. How did we survive that? Oh, Matterhorn. Okay, this way. Come on. Come on, sweetie. Come on. Come on, girl. We can do it. Did you see something or... I thought I saw something. -What was that? -I don't know. Happy birthday, Izzy. I'm sorry, I'm a little late. -Is this really our dog? -Yeah. Her name is Matterhorn, and she needed a good home, and I couldn't think of a better place for her -than with you. -Thanks, Dad. And here. The second gift I promised. Sorry, it's a little banged up. -It was a rough landing. -A glove? Yeah, I figured maybe we could play catch together. You know, if you want to. No pressure. -Thank you so much, Daddy. -I love you, honey. -Can I take her for a walk? -Sure. Yeah. Come on. Uh, rough landing? You're telling me that you flew here. Uh, technically I didn't fly, uh, Wilson did, I just jumped. And now you're telling me that you jumped out of a plane? I had to, Simone. The car was broken down, and there was just no way I was gonna get here in time. And I didn't want to let you two down. A dog? But, you said no dogs. That was when I was a selfish asshole. And I promise I'm not gonna be selfish anymore. This whole time, I've-- I've been chasing a dream. But the reality was, I was living my dream all along, and I was just too stupid to see it. So, please just... forget that kangaroo guy. Give me another chance. I was never interested in that kangaroo guy. He's a phony dick. At least you're a real asshole. Oh, you like the suit? Yeah, I like the suit. Ever since I got my head out of my ass, Simone and I have been hitting home runs. Even though she didn't win Lobster Tank, her business took off, and now I spend my days selling something I love even more than baseball: Simone's Sauces. Alex and Brenna got married and nine months later, they had baby Dana. Between Brenna's booming fashion business, and Alex's company going public, they're doing all right for themselves. Things are going great for Tyler, too. Now that he has a little sister, he's not a player anymore. Well, not that kind of player. After TU, he got drafted, and just recently he debuted in the bigs. Joe's happy doing what he loves the most, running a kick-ass sushi shop in Chicago. And Izzy, well, she made my dream of having a kid pitch D1 ball come true. She's the closer for MU. Shuck corn, Matterhorn! As for Hurley, turns out he was more of a creeper than we knew. He'll be coaching the prison softball team for the next five to ten.
