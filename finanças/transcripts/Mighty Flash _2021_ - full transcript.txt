Blessed be the mother who bore us! Hip hip, hooray! You dumb fuck! Are you cuckoo? You're gonna fall! - No! - Get back here! - 'Cause I'm the queen of the seas! Queen of the seas, my arse! You've never even left this place! Fucking queen of the seas, she says... Another dumb fuck, I dunno... - Fuck them all! - Aren't you a clever sod? - They're missing out on this, fuck them! - Queen of the seas... - This air and this water and this stick! - You're off your head... Look! Get a look at this! Fuck off, girdle. I'm fucking sick of this girdle! - Cita! What did you give the newlyweds? - Four prawn skins! The clown has arrived! Look! Trini, look. What a joke! Look, the Godmother's frills! A circus! A circus! I'm pissing myself! This is fucking rank, girl! Look, look! Look how filthy people are, pigs! - Come here, you slut! Come and raise a glass with Carmen! - Where's my pretty pussy? - Here! - Come. I'll hug and snuggle with you. Damn it! You moron! You dumb fuck! Leave me the fuck alone! - Mate... It's only a fucking joke. MIGHTY FLASH Hi Isa, it's Isa. If you hear me, you're hearing myself. There'll be a flash in the village, a really mighty, mighty one... and everything will change. We'll stare up at the sky because it's beautiful, it's dazzling and we'll all get very bad headaches, we'll lose our memories and be absorbed by the light and we'll disappear off the map, hopelessly. I have no dreams, I don't dream of flying, I can't fly. Birds fly, not me. The things I can do... I make soups, fried eggs, macaroni, omelettes and a bit of everything... I love fashion. I buy shoes, a dress, a jumper, a jacket and a bit of everything... My ma gets at me, she says: "Don't ask for so much, Missy, we're flat broke". There's nothing in the village and people get bored. They dressed up for carnival, the ladies go to the dance with their husband and for a drink, that's the way... That's the way. The only thing that happens is, at night, when you go past a stream you feel a chill on your face and your hair stands up on end as if it could be ripped from your head, but it's nothing, I don't get scared or anything, I just always think it's the ways of the atmosphere. Our elders used to say it was a type of wariness, you know? - Yes. And I always think there might be something else, in the land, in the village. You must never be afraid, just always be prepared, as there might be something in life, you know? - Yes. Right, Dad, see you tomorrow. - God willing... - Will I lock up? - If you want. TELL IT TO EVA Tonight we're joined by Goro and he's going to tell us his story. Good evening, Goro. - Evening. - Welcome to our show. Thanks. So, Goro, a woman leaves home, just like that. Why did she go? - Dunno. She wasn't happy, so she said. Whatever being happy is... - Damn! - Goro, imagine we're alone... - The cretin! Tell me.. Do you recall anything that might... - How...? How did he get on TV? She said I did something bad to her, I don't remember, my memory's bad... - You don't remember! - Or maybe you forgot on purpose? - No, my memory's bad. - He's pretending! I forget everything. You fibber! Goro, you know Cita better than anyone. Do you know where she might have gone? - A place her ma told her in a story. Far away, Lulu... I can't remember the name. Sure, that's where she is... Stupid! What happened to your arm, Goro? My arm? The day Cita disappeared, she left a letter in the kitchen I was so mad I went and smacked the table, split it. Let's cut to the chase, Goro... You're here to send a message to your wife, Cita, right? - Yes, that's why I'm here. To find her and talk to her. - We're here to help you. - He's just showing off on telly. - Look into the camera, this one, Goro. - You got away, that's my girl! Cita, for some reason you've gone, but I want you back. I love you better than before. I want to have you back. Woman, don't come back! You've gone. I want you back. I'm upset. I don't eat or drink and I dunno what to do. Come back, woman! I'm waiting for you. She's a white horse. I like white horses. In a white horse's eye, there's a little house. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. If I manage to get a paw out... and the head, it can be born. - Yes. I've managed to get it out. Of course, as it's been under the birth canal for too long, its tongue is all swollen and things. - Of course. - I massage it a little, and it lets out some cries as if the animal's recovering. Then, I see it's low on oxygen and give it some of mine. Then it starts... As it takes in the oxygen it gets better. If it's stillborn, that's it, it can't be saved, I skin it and put the scrap of skin on another of the same stock, more or less. - Of course. After 24 hours I take the scrap of skin off the stepchild. Good, and so... the real mum knows it's hers, but it smells of the other skin so she's not too happy. - Normal. There comes the time when the step- mum loves it more than the real mum, and that's a shepherd's life. - Right. - Where have you been? - At a moron's wedding, how about that? - Well I never! What a way to have fun and what strange festivities! - You're right. - Are you married or single? - I'm not even sure any more. - Where did your memory go? You should be with your husband. He said... neither the moon beams, nor the blazing sun, nor the greatest fortune would I exchange for your love, because like you, for me, there's simply no other like you. So... The owner of the La Jara ranch, Rodrigo was his name, was infatuated with a young thing from around here, and she was easy on the eye. - OK. - You know? He had a shepherd at the ranch. He was greasing the shepherd's palm and he married her off to the shepherd to stop tongues wagging. - To stop... - I heard about that! I heard about it. You used to hear it a lot, but it’s true. That story already... He had her there at his disposal in the ranch, every time he came and went, the picador didn’t beat around the bush. Didn't beat around the... And the girl got pregnant, and when he found out, the guy said: "Tough luck, then, I'm outta here." - Money, money... - Money. That's what money does. And the other poor bugger was landed with it. The shepherd was stuck with it. - That's right. - He took the rap. He was married to her so he was left with his missus and the little one. When he wanted a quickie... Eloy, a shot over here, we're drinking to the swine! Let's celebrate! How are you doing? Well... I'm getting there. Come on, keep your chin up! You just have to cope. - We're all so sorry about Paco's death. - I know. Yes, I know. But wouldn't it do you good to go to the village? - Yes, I'm going to go. - Of course, with all your neighbours. I've worked for long enough. When you're ready, ask Antonio to take you. Yes And you know we're here, for whatever you need. - Right. - Chin up. Right. The shawl is so beautiful. That's the shawl Dolores gave her. It's really lovely. Stunning, it goes well with that mantle and the one she gave her. That one was a gift, but it was anonymous. But the Virgin is stunning or maybe it's our faith in her. Beautiful. May God grant us the health to dress her for many more years. That's right. Guess what happened to me one day. What happened? I have a medal of a virgin and her picture disappeared. She goes everywhere with me, but... - Which virgin? - The Virgin of Dolores, but three days after I got back, I saw that her picture had disappeared. I took her to the watchmaker and he said: "How strange". So I put her away to take her to a jeweller. The watchmaker said to me: "Wait a few days or take her elsewhere", and I was waiting to take her to the jeweller, but three days went by and then I went to get her and her picture had come back. - You probably just imagined it had gone. - No, no... and that's not all... - It's like a miracle! Yes, it's a miracle, but a little later on, she spent a week in the washing machine. She must have been clean! I asked myself why her picture disappeared when I brought her back from somewhere I went and then in the washing machine, which is worse and more dangerous with the water and the products... she was fine. That was years later. - How strange. - Strange, indeed. See that? What a nerve coming in here. That one? To see the Virgin. She didn't have to come now, not now, she never comes to anything. She was at that wedding yesterday and hasn't changed her clothes, not even to sleep. She hasn't even washed her face. On top of it all, they've done so much for their children for their grandchildren some of whom become heartless and forget about them leaving them stranded, it's really sad. Out of every 100, 40 receive visits and, also out of every 100, only 16 leave the home at Christmas. It's very sad indeed. Brussels allows its partners to rule out high- risk 5G suppliers. The European Commission can monitor the safety of this new technology and the gross domestic product in Venezuela has dropped by 65% in these last six years of crisis. The family of the King came together to say farewell to the princess... You're such a pain, my girl. I'll feed you now so you'll let me finish eating in peace. All right, all right, I'll feed you now. But when night comes, I could poop myself with nerves, it scares me, I feel like when I go out there someone's going to put their hand here. It's that bad? It's that bad! I always think about my father, Berta. Your father? Not my mother, it's always my father. Because when I was a kid, I was playing in the street like all girls do... - Naturally. Naturally... And suddenly I heard the Guzzi... I recognised the sound even at that age! I knew the sound of that motorbike. I ran into the house and warned my mother. I said: "Mum, Dad's coming! Mum, Dad's coming! Mum, Dad's coming!" My mother was beside herself with nerves. Of course! So nervous. I can see it now... That hulk of a man when he came home, he came into the room and sat down in his big armchair and my mother had to kneel down to take off his boots and put his slippers on. What a slave. Just like a slave. - A maid. - Exactly. But that's the way it had to be. He... He was the one in charge. Then he went into the dining room, sat down in his big armchair, she'd already prepared the aperitifs, his wine, the things he liked and she went into the kitchen. It's all right, love. She prepared the lamb for him, she always had to do it every night, that meat. She took it to him, he ate, because... he never waited for her, never waited to eat with her! But we always had to wait for him and if he didn't come we had to go to school hungry. The injustice of yesterday. That's right, but he wouldn't wait. She took things to the dining room, he ate... And, there were so many times... Because in front of me, he held back. - He stopped himself a little. He stopped himself a lot! He pulled himself together. Many times, when my friends came to call for me, my mother kicked me under the table telling me not to go. Of course. Not with words, but with her foot, she told me not to go. I've lived with this fear forever. - Right. How could you not? I've lived with this fear forever. I've asked so many times when I'll be rid of this damn fear but it never goes away. What delicious sweets. They look fabulous. They're delicious. That lady made them. She uses goat's bill... - They truly are delicious. - Absolutely. Delicious, aren't they? - Oh, yes. - Sweets with honey are lovely. With honey, delicious. Holm oak honey from the countryside around here. - Incredible. - They truly are delicious. Isa! Didn't you bring the churros? You're so annoying, Ma. I forgot! I forgot the churros! - Your memory! You're a street rat! Out all day, you don't listen to me! - I do listen, Ma. - Sometimes yes, sometimes no! Sometimes yes, sometimes no. All night long glued to that tape player of yours, serpent this, serpent that. Inma! Jose! The churros are on their way! Yeah right! So many churros! The dummy with the churros! - Dummy? Get lost! - You're batshit! I'm not batshit, I've had it with you. My ma's over there! I'm not batshit. I'm going to the cops... the cops! Churros at this time of day! Now the mother, crazy... Antonio? I'm ready. Was that a gunshot? I heard a shot. I didn't hear anything. Did you, Valentina? If it rains, you make no money. - No work, no money. - Yeah, but you paint, right? You've got the land, the painting, the dole, your ma and pa's dole... Thanks to the dole I make it to the end of the month! - So you don't want a contract? - No! - Course not! - What if you fall? What then? Fat lot of good that'll do us! - I run out of money every month, Lolo. - Of course you do! Look, look. - Isa! - What? Hey, pretty girl. - Hello. - Where are you going? Home. Home? Come with us. No. Why would I come over there? - Why? To spend some time with us, right? - Don't want to! - Come here, pretty! - No. - Where've you been? - Leave me... - Where've you been? - Went for churros! - Want my churro? - No! That guy with his churro. Go fuck yourself, now! - Isa, come on! - No! - Come on! - No. A sip of beer, come on! No beer, I'll get drunk. How can you say that to the girl? Mate, you can't act like that. You're a bastard, you are! "I don't want churro", she said! - Antonio... - Yes? - Let me tell you something. - Go ahead. My mother kicked me out the day that I got married. Damn, why? She couldn't stand the sight of Paco. Not for a second! For God's sake! Why? She said he was a poor guy, like us! How about that? But you didn't care? I didn't care at all. I got married anyway in a black dress someone lent me. - And you wanted something else? - Sure... I always dreamt of a nice wedding. A nice white dress, a pearl necklace. - What a shame! Like a wealthy lady in my village who had one and wore it over her blouse, she looked dandy. You know what? My Paco said to me: "Don't you worry, love, I'm going to buy you one... And one morning, you'll wake up and your neck will shine with pearls from China." - From China? - From China! I thought: "How does this man know there are pearls in China? He's never been there." What I mean is I could do with some help from people who will support me, because I'm very busy. - Yes, whatever you need! - I can count on you, then? - Of course! - Great. See you tomorrow. - Yes, God willing. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. CHURROS AND CHOCOLATE Free yourself from the past And be reborn Always keep the door open To a new world Where've you been? What do you care? Where the fuck do I fit in here? And with all these people watching me. They're my mother's images! This is fucking pathetic. Well, well! "Pathetic", she says! If we'd had a child, we'd have been happier. I think the ceiling tastes different. Yes. Well? Aren't you going to try it? Get and try it! I'm going. What does it taste like? Like orange tree. That's right. Are you all right, Julia? - Yes. Off with this nightgown. Let's wash your face. There you go. It's cold! - What a little whiner you are! - It's really cold. You're sad today. No, my love. What's wrong? I don't know, Julia. Just my stuff, love. Tell me, for crying out loud! Tell you what, my love? I don't know. Do you know what Alilu is? - Alilu? - Yes. I bet you don't know. - I don’t. I knew it! Look, I'll tell you. Now, how can I explain what Alilu is? It's a sky made of glass with two huge moons, made of glass, too. - Glass? - Yes! And coloured clouds! All colours, and they pee caramel. Caramel? A load of caramel in masses of flavours: strawberry, mint... lentils! Yuck! Chickpeas! You don't like that, do you? - No. Chocolate? - Yes. - Chocolate's fine, right? I told my mum about it every day. Alilu this, Alilu that. She just had enough of so much Alilu! Because you're so annoying! The thing is, Julia, I think she'd been there, too. She'd been to Alilu. I'm sure of it. She made me a little doll. It was tiny, tiny! It took a lot of patience, a lot of care. She was beautiful! She had a round head. She didn't have one bump on her. - How lovely! - Yes. She was lovely. For the Three Kings, she made her a new dress and I had a new doll. I miss her so much. Mate! Don't "mate" me, no... I'm the one asking you, mate. I know. But I didn't take it out. Maybe one of my nieces or nephews or kids took it out. So they stole it? Maybe! I didn't take it out. Don't fuck with me. Stop messing around. - I haven't taken the bike out for days. That's bullshit. You think it's bullshit? Explain it to me, then. - No, you explain it to me! - But the way things are... You think I'd go to your estate and kill one of your beasts? Come on! You might find her one day and bring her here to him. Poor Goro! That's what I think... He's dug his own hole! She's gone off with another man, leaving that poor sod with a broken paw and fuck all else. - She's devil- may- care. - Yeah, and she's a slut, you know? He loves her, though. I mean, that man... It's all he's got. There you go then! She may be a slut, but he sure loves her. Like loads of marriages: the woman's like that and the man's a good person. I know her, but not that well. Who knows what she gets up to. I went with the owners to the ranch, all they wanted was to kill. And the more the better! They get paid for the meat and the antlers. A stag came up to me, right in front, from here... to there. Bang! I shot it and that stag looked at me with tears... and I mean real tears, look, I've got goosebumps. He fell down like this, watching me. That was that. I haven't shot a stag since. I haven't! What did you get? Nothing. People come here to forget the bad things they've done. Sometimes, when they deserve it, I give them penance. You don't look like you've done anything bad. Well... I don't think so. Do you remember... when you stepped out of your house dressed in white, Maria? I was in black, black and borrowed. Well I never! And you've ended up in black, too. - That's right. They set you up to give the fool a head start. What fool? All those fools that need a head start. What do you mean by that? They empty you, they empty you. So you accept that you'll never shine and that's the end of it. And after all that, they drop like flies. Just look at yours. You've been left alone, broken again and dressed in black. Yes. And on top of it all, if you're poor, like you... Very. You don't even have a miserable maid to cry to. That's true. You don't belong to the caste of cowards, Maria. I know. Sit down and wait. All right. Hang on in there. That's what us women have to do. Good God. If, by chance... you still have... a little magic left in you, the magic we had when we were little... - Yes. - Kids... Stroll through the streets, let the sun kiss that little face of yours, damn it. We'll see about that. What do you mean, "we'll see"? We'll see.. if I feel like going out. This is what I'm used to, after all. Come on rise up, rise up Protesting is over now And we're heading into the crossfire The evil eye stuff... my mum does it for me. When I have a headache, I pick up the phone and call my mum: "Look what's wrong with me, Mum. A headache. Heal me." She says: "I'll heal you." She uses the moon to heal me and it goes. That Peruvian priest. Where in Peru is he from? You don't know? - He's Bolivian. Oh, he's Bolivian. I thought he was Peruvian. Who cares, anyway. He's of that breed. The boy was nice, but I was very picky. What beautiful times! Very demanding. He couldn't pronounce his r's. - Didn't you like him? - Well.,. - Because of his r's... - No... - No, because he didn't complete me. I didn't like him. - If he didn't complete you... - What? If he didn't complete you, that's that. It has to be something that... You know? Then, when I was older, some gentlemen came to our little gang, and the odd friend got excited thinking they'd come because of her... - What a shame! - and then realised it was because of me. The village is dead, you know? The only people left are old folk like us. The young people leave, they've studied and have left the village. And the babies that are born aren't born here. She won't give you the recipe. That lady's made sweets for years. It's her secret! You only come here to have fun! When it's time to pitch in, nobody comes! You're right there. For God's sake! The pig slaughter was yesterday, nobody came to work! Lots of pots and pans to wash! When there's fun to be had everybody shows up! I'm ticked off because that's how it is! It's true. Eating! Drinking! Fun and games! A bit of a dance... But when it's time to pitch in... When it's time to pitch in... nobody shows up! Us on the board, we're the only ones who work! Peeling garlic, peeling onions, peeling peppers, tying guts... - Tying guts. - You see? That's a lot of work. - Washer- uppers! - And the pots and pans? - And the blood? - No! - I work, too... - But I didn't say... Ana, you're a chair, I'm the president and what I say gets done with help from you. How funny! She was a catechist... Goodness! The things we ask for those people! Have you eaten a lot? Are you feeling hot? It'll be that lady's sweets. Holm oak honey, I love it! We haven't taken a single pill or anything like that and we feel really at ease. - What a lovely blouse. - Yes. I bought it the other day. - Is it silk? Yes, real silk. - It's really lovely. - It was expensive. - Yes, it really suits you. - Yes. - The necklace is lovely, too. - Lovely. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. I have a boyfriend called Batman. He has a car. - What does he do? - He works, with people. - And what colour is his car? - Black. - Where's he from? - He's from... Salamanca. - And he travels the world? - Yeah! Doing work for everyone but me! It pisses me off, I won't say how much. - How many kisses does he give you a day? - Four. - He's madly in love with you! - Yeah, we're in love! - Does he love you with all his heart? - But he works, I have to do everything! - Why? - He's so annoying! Isa, why do you have to do everything? Well, because I do. He comes back and I have to make his breakfast, his lunch, food on the table. - You do it all. - All of it! - Is he hunky, is he strong? - He's strong. He goes to the gym? Yeah. Yeah. He has a black suit. - How much did his black suit cost? - Dunno. Big bucks. It cost big bucks. - You go out with him? - Yeah. - He takes you out? - Yeah. This way, Miss. It's that door opposite. He's waiting for you. I'll wait for you in the car. Take your panties off. Go into the next room, get undressed and come back. - Good evening. - Good evening. Poor Antonio! Oh, love! He just lost his mind, that's it. They seemed very close, that's what it looked like. Have patience, my child. Mine's got no work, now. Maria... I've been there! I walked through a meadow and in the distance I saw a mountain range. At the foot of the mountains, there was a house. I was scared until I reached it. When I got there, I opened the door and went in. There was a lovely dining room, big and with very grand furniture, so beautiful! There was a table in the middle of the dining room with a glass sweet jar full of bonbons! I took the lid off, took one and put it in my mouth. It tasted exquisite, exquisite! When the bonbon melted, I felt something in my mouth. I put my fingers in and took out a tiny, tiny dragon. The dragon got bigger and started to fly. I climbed onto its back. It had feathers. The feathers brushed against me and it felt really, really nice... It took me through frozen clouds, through groves of green trees, through white waterfalls! It was so beautiful, it seemed like abuse! I could taste a starry sky in my mouth. I could hear a rumba in the distance. The music from a rumba that seemed like the end of the world. Mother, I want an olive picker man an olive picker man with a rod in his hand, he's gracious he's gracious When he looks at me, Mother I feel myself dying Mother, I want an olive picker man an olive picker mon that's what I like Use that rod! Use that rod! Use it well The green ones are worth more the black ones for you for you, for you I would die for you I would die for you meanwhile I'll sing to you telling of the woes caused by loving you Use that rod! Use that rod! Use it well The green ones are worth more the black ones for you for you, for you I'm going to the green field to see if I can see you To see if I can see you I'm going to the green field I'm going to the green field to see if I can see you I'm going to the green... Mate! Mate! Mate! Look! Look! Look! - Get over here with us! - Jesus Christ! He loves a good grind! We've had three drinks. Take that! - Come here! - Over here! We're with friends here, fuck!

Carmen, Carmencita, don't get hooked! Just one... Come on, come on! Watch out, you'll fall over! Give it a rest, mate. - I'm pissing myself!. - Your turn. - It's Carmencita's turn! - Hold this. No, not Carmencita. Or are you paying for her? - Just one! Seeing as she's here. - Come on!.. What did you come for, then? - Shut the fuck up! Fuck, come on, Toro! She can suck us all off. Don’t get carried away. You're rank, mate! Rank! - Your mum can suck you off! - Look after Cita. - Come on. - Leave me be. Come on. Carmen! Carmen! Carmen! Fucking hell, mate! Scratch that beak's itch. Come on! Again! Another one! - More! - Here, here, here... Fuck! That's my boy! Go on! Let's go! You're the best! Cita, you haven't the balls! Shut up! Come on. - Hot girl! - Come on, be brave! No. Leave me alone! Come on, get out there! I said no! Just watch me. Look! Cita, Cita, Cita, Cita! What a picture! What a picture! Shake that arse, Cita! - That little arse! Tonight you're gonna nail her. - Who? - You! I nail her every time I want to! - Look at them dance! - How ugly! How ugly! Jug! Look at her jug body. - She's nothing but meat. - She's gonna stay here. Cita, let's see your tits! - How about the other one? Ole! - Body! Nail her! Let’s see your tits! Nail her! - Get going! - Hurry up! Quickly, quickly! Go, go! Quickly, quickly! - Let's go! - Go, go, go! To me, you resemble the daybreak when you appear up there Climb up! With that little throat and those hooped earrings you resemble the queen when she leaves the palace you resemble the queen when she leaves the palace The Holy Week is incense, wax, images, cod and spinach, starched fabric, meeting up with friends and relatives, parades or processions and brotherhoods, passion and devotion and the humble splendour of its floats. Here, we welcome the Holy Week with much faith, the region opens itself up to the fervour that the village builds around the Virgin Dolorosa who meets her son on the cross in an image that embodies the suffering of a mother facing the events awaiting her in the coming hours. It's the image that the village is the most devoted to, maybe the most special procession and the one people like the most because of the meeting of the Virgin Dolorosa and The Crucified that takes place around the Pilar de los Cuatro Canos while, in the distance, a saeta is heard and people cry with emotion due to the realness of the images and their symbolism. Prior to this manifestation of faith, at 6:00 p.m., there will be the solemn Lord's Supper and the Most Holy will be moved to the Monument. The parade leaves the Parochial Church of the Immaculate Conception and moves through the streets of Pio IX, 4 Canos... We'll fold it, Joaquina. - Here. - Exactly. - Put it on this side. - Come here. We'll put it here. - You, go upstairs and get the toolbox, it's not here! You say it's all here, but it's not! Cita! Cita! Bitch! The fucker is fucked!
