No, that's not it, stop. I'm losing patience. You're never together, What are you doing? Estelle, it's you that's wrong Take a break, girls. Out already? I was released two months early for good conduct. That surprises you, Danseur? It bothers you? On the contrary. That's good. I have a couple of questions to ask you. I'm listening. Where is Lola? She left a while ago. With whom? I don't know What's it to me? With a bloke What bloke? On my word, I don't know him. Where will I find him? He often goes to the Adrien, you know it? Who informed on me? What do you mean? You surely don't think.. So, he said to me: .. "If you like me, then you like them rough " Hello, my dear. You want to come upstairs with me? You can see the sea. You could answer. You don't like my girlfriend? Lola, do you have any matches? This is the place. It will be there between 2 and 3am Everything alright? You're not alone? Who is it? Now, I'm off We said 5000 francs, Mr. Boccace We were told ... Half in advance. It's all in there I must dash. Until Monday. Are you well? It's been paid for? Put on your hat, get your bag and come. Where are you going, Lola? Me? Nowhere. Well then put down your coat, your bag, and go and sit down. You heard what I said? What are you doing, Lola? Nothing, I ... You're going somewhere? It's Siffredi. Get rid of him. I put in a few chives. I know you like them You've made it well Lola has always liked to eat well. That's rare among women. And that's not the only thing she's likes She is someone of good taste, .. discreet ... Faithful. Can I have a little sauce? This is really good. You forget how good it can be It must change you. Say, how long were you in ? Four months. Why? It was my own fault It makes you think, prison. Now ... I've more time to lose. Someone's coming. He's here? Where have you been? We looked for you everywhere. I've sprained my ankle. I have weak ankles. Especially when there's work. Can I ask you an indiscreet question? What kind? That could earn you money? I'd have to see. How's that? We'll do heads or tails. Choose. Heads. You lose. That's normal, I'm always lucky What do I have to do? Take Mario's place. What's that? An accident? Go and see, it's probably a drunk. It wasn't difficult, I told you so What's in the back? Have a look. A horse? It's a champion, 'Wonderful', you know it? One of the favourites for tomorrow's Grand Prix The other is Rouge-Gorge, which belongs to Boccace. The drinks chap? Exactly. This gentleman would like to win, so, he removed Wonderful. And you are going to bet on Red-Gorge. With the money from Boccace That's not bad He's not going to make it Who won? Vanina. You know who owns Vanina 2? No, it belongs to Rinaldi. That wouldn't be your lawyer by chance? The twisters Hello Capella, how are you? My partner. Sit down. We don't have much time. A cigar? We're in a hurry. I must congratulate you, it was perfect. The two men you warned have recovered the truck. I've worked out what I owe you: 2500 francs. Plus the 2500 I lost on Red-Gorge. You bet Rouge-Gorge? Not just me. Capella, don't play the horses Do I bet? You should have won .. .. the money on Vanina 2? Vanina 2 doesn't belong to me I am pleased that my friend Maitre Rinaldi has won, but ... I'm going to be generous I'll cover you for your losses, here's another 2500 francs. You'll have a glass? And my share? How's that? He's my partner. I know. So, you share. I would never take a share from a friend. Question of principle. You've done a bit boxing, eh A little. The one that you put down, this is my friend, Mario. He has fragile ankles. This is my cousin, Kid Maurice. You know? That doesn't matter We've been looking for a chap like you What would you say to fighting him in the ring? Really? Not completely straight But there has money to be made and I'll take care of everything. So you're called Hans Petrus and you're champion of Bavaria. From Bavaria? Where is it? It is ... It's where, Bavaria? In Germany? I don't speak .. .. German. I am delighted to see you. You know Kid Mauritius .. .. and here's Hans Petrus, champion of Bavaria. 28 fights, 21 wins, .. including 17 by way of knockout and 4 draws Hans Petrus lives in Munich, and is married with 2 young daughters. Please, Herr Petrus ... Listen, we are in France, so speak French. I asked the name .. ..of his two daughters. Bertha and Marlene. Here, you hold it. Kid, start slowly. There's Capella. Enjoy yourself. I told him to go hard for a round or so Like that, they're going to get their money's worth Petrus, he's only faking. We haven't made a mistake. No, I disagree. So, that's it? What were you doing?? You've ruined a great show. He has been Knocked-out. This is Capella and Siffredi. Let me present Maitre Rinaldi. We know each other a little. Your little business is settled The fire insurance .. .. All taken care of, we won't talk anymore about it Well, you can be proud of yourself The gloves, you can hang them up, finished. And you. Go back to the docks. Family I invited a few friends tonight, would you like to join us? We'll celebrate the victory of Petrus. .. has just signed him up It seems that it was you who discovered him. Until tonight. You want some? Who's that? It's Marello, with Poli he runs Marseilles. They're old school, but important. Well established. What's he doing at Rinaldi's? Boccace without Rinaldi, is nothing. And Rinaldi without Marello is no big thing You have everything you want? The big fellow, that's Poli. Simon told me about a job you did for him. Skilful, intelligent. and well paid, it seems. Reasonably That's not the question, money is secondary. You're here, come These are the two young men .. .. that I told you about M Escarguel controls 60% of the fish markets in Marseilles. And he has a little problem which he would like to talk to you about. My husband goes out very little. And this is not the ideal place to talk about these things. Could you come to the house one day this week? Why not? Excuse me, I'll leave you to it Would 10am Wednesday suit? Why did you wait in your car this afternoon? I hate boxing. I'm Siffredi. Roch Siffredi, I know. You've been in prison: breaking and entering. You also spent two years in a battalion in Tunisia. You do not have money ... and you are looking for some I am Mrs. Rinaldi, the wife of Maitre Rinaldi. This is my establishment I should know the people that I invite at least that? Your name? Your fragrance? They say that I put on too much perfume, but I'm afraid of smelling of fish. Hello, I would like something expensive and beautiful. For a woman of the world. Roses. The roses are nice? I'll go for the roses. A dozen? I'm Capella. Strange name. Why? I don't know but it's funny. I interest you? I'd like to see you again. Good idea. You play tennis? I played a long time ago, I would have to get fit. Would you rather go on a boat trip? Right away. I have an appointment In 5 minutes. Your bouquet, sir. For your business appointment? No, these are for you. Hurry up. That's my car. We could go to the Alcazar one night, or to the cinema. I don't know if my father would agree. What does your Father do? He's in business too My name is Ginette. I'll accompany you, .. the streets of Marseille are not safe. I don't mind, I have a car too Really? Tell me, Madame Escarguel's office - At the top of the staircase. We couldn't wait for you any longer. Your friend is punctual and he brought me flowers. I had a puncture Let me introduce my husband. Mr. Capella, my husband. My husband had an accident, .. it is hard for him to speak and move, .. but he he still has all his faculties Being the only one to understand this I must take care of everything. It's not really a life All those smells ... I explained to your friend ... M. Escarguel has two competitors, the Pradel brothers They should be discouraged. I see. He wishes to supply all the fish markets. That's very clear. You explain things better than me. For this collaboration? Well, I thought ... 10 per cent. This pleases my husband very much Have you any idea? How you're going to proceed? We'll think about it. It's not so urgent. As seeing you again I would like very much to have you to dinner soon. If you think of something in the weeks ahead .. but above all... be... Discreet. My husband is very keen. That this works, but ... Discreet. Come on, ladies, set to it. This fish is not fresh. Not fresh! ? Smell it It smells fine, it was caught last night. Ladies, Smell that for me. An infection? This fish is not fresh. My fish is not fresh? It's tail still moves, not like yours. It is rotten. It's fresh, no doubt about it. I've seen you, you threw out your fish .. .. from your basket, no buts this time. So it's not fresh? Hop it you. But what's happening? He says that it's not fresh. It seems fine to me Come on, ladies, let's go. The bathroom The bedroom. You have a phone? In the bedroom and lounge. The salon. And tell me, for my friends? Two small rooms, but on the same floor. You put me on a canopy bed. With columns. Then some pictures with forests and naked women. There is a safe? What make? A Durox, model 44-S. Well, put this in it My respects, They are charming. It's amazing. That feels good. wait, it's deeper here I'm going to change by the rocks. I'll leave you my umbrella, I'll come back. I always want to talk to you, but we never have the time. You're right. You could make a killing like the one with the fish, .. but bigger. Explain. What about Poli? The butcher's shop That doesn't interest me, the butcher's shop I like .. .. butchers. You can have it, Poli. He is like Marello, finished. A little push and he will fall No, I'm not interested. Let me at least explain it to you. I'm going to do heads or tails. Tails. You lose. Don't play with me Your friend seems angry. Is it because of me? Who is the young girl? I would like to get to know her. She's Poli's latest, Ginette. What? Poli's new girl. It seem's he's mad about her. Are you sure? As much as one can be Where are you going? I'm going to say hello to them Where is the basket? I'm taking off my jacket. I'll open the ros? I'm going to set the table. I've marked my jacket. Here are the tomatoes. The other plates. You know each other? More or less. Want a pastis? Your father's not here? He couldn't come. Business, you know what it's like. I was going to suggest a little boat trip That would be a good idea, one of these days Why not right now? I'll follow you You think perhaps it's dangerous for him Women are dangerous This is nice. It's beautiful You often go sailing? They've left us behind What will your father say? How are you? Well, and you? A friend. Got a place? At the main table. Follow me. Francis is there, he's waiting for you I didn't want to return to the hotel like this I came here. You've done well. What's been happening? I can stay? For as long as you want. Rest yourself. I wanted to tell you ... About the butcher shop, it's alright. The butcher ... What's this idea you wanted to talk about? I'd would rather have not heard anything The butcher shop... Have you lost your head or something? You know who runs the butcher shop? And so? You know him? You know what he is capable of? That doesn't scare you? Listen to me. You've made your place in the sun. You've got some nerve, Capella and you, you're not blunderers, We left you to enjoy yourself with the brother-in-law's fish. He is very tired. Then my sister insisted. But don't go rubbing up against the real bosses. Do you understand? I don't see why you're taking Poli's side You are rather tied to Marello? I'm not tied to anyone I'm his lawyer, that's all And I'm going to tell you, .. Poli and Marello have run this city for four years. No friction, no setbacks. It works. Don't go meddling in it. I was seven years old when I ate meat for the first time. Fran?ois, don't go there, they're waiting for you. Everyone out. All right? Take that. Damn, a flat. Lets go, quick. You won't make it You see. We did. Francis, head for my Mother's Tell me, Francis. You haven't spoken to Ginette about it? Go to the hotel. Ginette was coming tonight. You're expected. This way. You still think about Ginette? Was it serious? You would have left with her? What do you mean left? I don't know, leave, go somewhere else With her? Perhaps. Mario, we weren't able to go his funeral, it's sad. Are we going to stay here for long? - However long it takes. I don't mind, I love the countryside. Looks like the Fada is coming. They've come from Beziers, they're looking for a hideout. For? A stickup Any trouble? A little. Look after them. All went well? Fine. Here are the newspapers. -Let's see. And the rest? It's there. Help me. No, leave They're not new, they come from Morocco. But they've been verified. This is what you wanted? You have them... In the other case Good, show me. Tell me, has master Rinaldi been appointed deputy Mayor ? He didn't lose this time He has nothing on us? Poli thinks you're out of circulation Good, we'll let him go on believing that At Poli's? Now? But listen ... Well, I'll get on. I'm coming You wait for me, are you coming or will we meet up at the theatre? I'm coming with you. We shouldn't be long. What's this? What's happening? We learned of your appointment. We wanted to congratulate you. Where were you going? To the theatre. To see what? You look surprised, Maitre To see you here? Yes, a little. Like us, this evening at the slaughterhouse We were surprised to see that they were waiting for us I had warned you, but don't infer from... You'll be late for the theatre. It may have even finished. What do you think? We've thought a lot about you. But you can be useful to us Yes, we intend to buy this place You want to buy? But where is Poli? He died, .. at the restaurant. A quarter of an hour? Twenty minutes. Dead? Whether the angels .. .. lead you to paradise. That martyrs welcome you on your arrival. That the angels receive you, that you enjoy eternal rest .. .. with the one who was once the poor Lazarus. Mr. Marello .. .. would like to talk to you. About what, Danseur? It's simple: you take over from Poli. But Poli never touched what belongs to Mr. Marello .. .. and you will not touch it So? I warn you. You took Poli by surprise, I am a naturally suspicious. Very suspicious. And Rinaldi is my friend. If you touch him, you touch me too. Why would we hit him? Moreover, Maitre Rinaldi isn't looking after your business anymore I don't like being spoken to in that tone, Danseur. Obviously, Mr. Poli had his accounts in there In love as in business, some things are not written down. Mr. Poli had interests all over Marseilles. Of course, there are hotels, restaurants, .. the downside of drinking. You are invaluable, M. Martial. Always by the percentage system You know, I have been in business a long time I started in '94 with the Valabres brothers. You are too young to know them Tell me ... It comes straight from Chicago. Good, put it there. 250 like that, it's going to be mad Well, Lola, the disc. You like that? It's opulent. Designed by Leleu. Because Now, you ... Wait, look at that. A beautiful Guyot bronze Chinese, very rare colour: beef blood Coromandel, 18th century Come see. All's well with the business? There's a future in business. There's a future in everything. How could one not pay tribute to the success of The new ..municipality? When we see our beautiful city Marseille. A gateway to the East .. each day .. more modern, prosperous. And happier. It is therefore with deep conviction that I say to you: .. next month by voting for me, .. you vote for progress. For justice. And for peace. We don't see you much at the Casino. You've become such a busy man And Marseille owes you a lot. Answer me frankly, my husband has done something to you Tell me what. Please I need to know. He had talked about your projects to Poli, is that it? Don't ask these kind of questions It's strange, whenever I meet you, .. you never seem satisfied Should I be? You have all that you want. You think so? You don't like these elections much? Rinaldi MP, Marello behind ... It would lack .. more than that. What can be done? Not during the election that would be awkward. Come on, let's have another one Here, roughly, these are the expenses The salaries, management fees, good works ... Good works? Yes, orphanages, asylums. Tradition calls for it Taxation is overwhelming today. The police are here. --So? An inspector's asking for you Please follow me to the police station. Inform Maitre Rinaldi. That won't be easy. Why? Because he has two bullets in his body. He's in hospital in a serious condition. This way. Let's go Monsieur the Commissioner. Sit down, Mr. Capella. As long as things are kept between yourselves, .. we do not get involved When wolves devour each other it is the shepherd's business Master Rinaldi is the deputy Mayor of Marseilles, .. even our future MP so we intervene. I was at my office all day. I have witnesses. Of course, you've a watertight alibi. I've haven't even asked you, I was sure of it. All the same I'm going to ask you the usual questions But beware, do not go too far. Who shot him? That would be an interesting question if you were asking it.. to Mr. .. Siffredi. So? Nothing special, they were released, of course. But there is a little friction between the two. In what way? Siffredi perhaps made his move without informing Capella Possibly. Are you waiting for them to break once and for all? You warned them not to touch Rinaldi .. .. and they have It beginning to be said that they frighten you Listen, Danseur, .. Let people talk They're just small cons, there's nothing to lose by waiting You know that? Firing on Rinaldi and missing him .. they made a Member of Parliament of him You understand ? It's me who came up with this headline With two bullets in the body, he is certain to be elected. It was agreed we shouldn't touch Rinaldi Especially before the election. I haven't touched Rinaldi. Someone's trying to cause trouble I know. Not Marello himself. I don't see his interest. I don't agree with you. He stands in your light. What are you saying? He bothers you. Everyone bothers you. I'm telling you it's not me. Do you want something else? Nothing more. It's not often that I have the opportunity to see you. How's Roch? Always the same. Play for me. I really like this place. Do you remember the boat, the evening ..when you brought Roch back? You've come a long way since then I still like to cook for you Listen, Rinaldi has been had, for good this time. At the hospital? Yes, stabbed Who did it ? We don't know Where is Roch? We have to find him Come on, come with me. Where's Roch? I don't know. But someone's waiting for him I wanted to see Mr. Siffredi. It is about the death of my husband. I know who killed him. Where is the boss? In his office. He's here, you want to talk to him? Someone's trying to start trouble between us and Marello Why? So they can take our place. A bastard shot down Rinaldi.. .. To make Marello think it was us I knew that. Someone recognised you At the hospital. Special Edition. Le Journal The Rinaldi Affair. They've done Nono and ... What? They came passed Adrien's Marello shouldn't have done that After the death of Danseur, we were even. He wanted to teach us a lesson. Let's show him we are good pupils I'm sorry, there is no room. What? I would like to see Marello. A moment Mr. Marello awaits you. I preferred to talk to you directly You're quite right. What do you want? You're wrong about Rinaldi. Possibly. No, that's certain. It's Danseur who shot him To put us against each other .. .. and profit from it Capella knew this and did what he had to do. You had no reason to call it. You knew that. I know what I had to do. But you're wrong. And so? It is a mistake which is hard to forget You're getting old, Marello. There are things which escape you And it is serious. You should stand down Is this what you came to tell me? You shouldn't have bothered I wanted to tell you. Hear me well. I know what I'm risking You could shoot me down now easily. You haven't had it for a while, Marello. I wanted to tell you to your face Come on, down the bottom, let's go. I hope this time, he understood. Don't worry, he understood. Obviously, you have an alibi, you were here I suppose you've had your wallet stolen? You should complain. I did. Try to find them. In mine, there were photos of my mother. You didn't recognise the men who did this? And the death of Marello, He must have slipped and fallen.. .. on his paper-cutter That seems very strange Surely. This face mean anything to you ? Yes, but I don't know his name. He was called Danseur. Ms. Rinaldi has identified him as her husband's killer As he is also dead another case is closed. You are the little kings of Marseilles. There is nobody else It's the time to be very careful We have a new mayor. A nice business Capella and Siffredi support him, it may be good for us. You think so His face tells me something. Charming, this soir?e. Things going the way you want it? Fine And you? What do you have? Nothing. I'm off You've time. Not so much I have a train to catch What? In one hour. Where are you going? To Nice. From there, I'm going to Italy. You're going alone? No, I'm taking Lola. You're going? I told you. For long? Perhaps. I'm going to the hotel to get my luggage. Why are you going? Because we are two I don't understand It's simple. First we had Poli .. then Dancer, then Marello. There is no reason for it to stop. One day or another, there will be only one of us It's better that I go now It will finish by bringing us down Perhaps I will start it It's the way things are, we can't help it. And you know it And what if I left ? Instead of you You would do it? Immediately. I'll play you for it If you lose, you go Agreed? What's your call? Heads. This time, you win, Roch. You knew it? A coin in each pocket. Before that used to amuse me. But not tonight. Bye, Roch. Chance, it doesn't exist. Chance ... You see, it doesn't exist.
