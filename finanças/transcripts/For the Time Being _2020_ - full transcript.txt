FOR THE TIME BEING Lunch is ready. The pool is not filling up. Did you turn it on? Of course, as usual. Three hours yesterday. Today I put it on for two hours. But I had to turn it off. It's not filling up. It bothers me, the kids are just about to come. What will they say when they see it like this? When do they arrive? Come and help me over here. - This? - Yes. Let's put it over here. Like this, turn it over. So now... Wait, a bit more. You should get up earlier tomorrow. We'll have lunch together. - It might be leaking somewhere. - What? The water in the pool might be leaking. That's the last thing we need. Take this to your brother's room. Let's go! Let's go, Ladies! Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, let's go. Come on. Let's go. Mum, telephone. Coming! How can you not know that? They should have told you something. No, they are not going to sleep in a hotel. Tell her to come here. Yes, they have to come here. The beds are made up already. Send me her phone number. I'll tell her to come here. Well, take care. His flight was canceled. Come and get it! Come and get it. Back up. Go away. Back up, go away! Come and get it. Come and get it. Buckle up. Watch out, you'll get sunburnt. You watch out yourself. You'll set everything on fire. Grandma said, it's not allowed to smoke outside. Ole, come here. I'm calling your father. - Are you already back? - Yes, lunch is almost ready. I'm calling your father. He's not answering. Larissa! Where have you been? We went to see the cows, you were still asleep. She has a rifle as big as Dad's. Is this necessary? - Did she let you shoot? - No, it's prohibited in summer. - That's not true. - Yes it is, until autumn. You don't even know that. Atta... - Attack! - Be quiet. - Come on, dry up. - No! Mum! No! Dry yourself up for once. And you, take your wet panties off. - I got you a dry one. - No! Stand up, please. Aeroplane! - Don't put the bread in there. - Watch out, bomb! - There is already a lot of bread in it. - Mayday, we are sinking! Are you listening to me? Salmojero is made out of a lot of bread. Behave yourself. Mayday, we're going to crash. It's just a military test. Mom, what was that? That was just... a fake explosion. - What does that mean? - Just a test. Now it's my turn! - No! - Yes, it is. - No! - Of course! - No! - Yes, it is. That's unfair. - Jon! - Of course! I... - Yes, it is! - No! Yes! Damn, I'm leaving. "Y"... Push "Y". Use "Y". Use "Y", Ole. This is a private property! We're sorry, but we lost track. We don't know how to get out of here. The gate we passed is closed now. How can we get out? Do not leave the path! Don't just pass the gates and enter private grounds. Please excuse us, Madame. You are now in a private finca, because you just passed the gate. This happens all the time. We apologize, but we still need to get out. Mum. Mum. Yes? - Do you love me? - Of course I do. - And do you love Ole? - I love you both. And do you love Dad? Yes. And do you love yourself? Where is Ole? Ole! Ole! Where are you? Ole! Where are you? - Have you seen the kids? - No. And Larissa? There is no water. - Have you been filling up the pool? - Yes. But it's leaking and I don't know from where. Take it. Boys! - Yes? - I'm back in a moment. - Do we have water again? - Yes. What was the matter? We used too much of it today. Ole told me he broke something. I'm very sorry. I'll replace it. He told me, he apologized to you. Did he? No. Don't mind. It doesn't matter. Did you hear anything from their father? - No. And you? - No. Are you leaving? Take this, please. You don't depend on him. Larissa, I turn it off over here!
