[Eerie music] [narrator] There is a house. There is a house with a view of a very hungry monster. [Flies buzzing] [distant sirens blaring] [clock chimes] [insect skitters] Isn't it crazy that... someone could actually be in our house fucking right now. Seriously, Dennis? Your mind goes there? I mean, it's something that people just do. - You're so gross. - It's crazy, though. To think that we live in a world, where we get paid to let strangers into our lives. And somehow, it just works. At least, most of the time. - I've heard stories, you know? - Well, it's not like we let the Manson family come sleep in our house, so we'll probably be okay. Or did we? Wait, so, one minute it's nymphos and the next we have serial killers? I mean, I never mentioned anything about serial killers. - You did. - You were alluding to it, though. I would make for an interesting house party. [Gentle organ music] [moaning] [music intensifies] [music stops] [gentle organ music] [Rita] Chapter one needs to show the monster as scary. But not too scary... he preys in the darkness. He's there. He's a big... scary monster, with his teeth sharper than razors. His eyes full of rage and hatred. But this monster, our monster... wants to be safe. He just doesn't know it at the beginning. [Sobbing] [ground rustling] [eerie music] Oh, hi. [Child laughs] [high-pitched ringing] Hey, Tom! Oh, my God, you can not run off like that! [Tom laughs] Oh, hi. [Mother] I am so sorry. You turn your back for a second, and they're just gone. - Come here, give me your hand. - It's fine. [Mother] No, hold my hand. I'm telling you, walking destruction. May I have your hand? - Come on. - [Axe thuds] It's beautiful, isn't it? What? Just to be off the grid. I mean, I'm sure you've had time to think about your book. Yeah. How's that coming along? You know. Fuck me for asking. - [Crickets chirping] - [clock ticking] [eerie musical sting] [Dennis] I had another nightmare last night. It's crazy, so just be warned. What happened? [Sighs loudly] We were both asleep in the van. But I was awake. You had your back towards me. For some reason, we were both placed in the front of the van. I tried to move but I was paralyzed. [Knocking on car window] There was people behind me. [Eerie musical sting] - It didn't bother me. - [Echoed chatter] More so that, then it was you. You see, the more I stared at you, I started realizing that it wasn't you sitting next to me. I tried to say your name. As I opened my mouth, it, it was as if a ticking sound-- [clock ticking] [knocking] [woman laughs] And then I woke up. Listen, I'm done with this all. All of what? Things were crazy back home. And anybody in our situation would've done the same thing. But it's changed. When I'm with you, everything just feels... just... - Well, what do we do? - We could leave, we could just start a family. [Gentle organ music] Just start over. Move. Okay, let's do it. - Let's do it. - Let's do it. No more weird fucking dreams, God. Oh, and, and I forgot, there's one more part. Your mom just walks in and starts doing the polka. Oh, my God, shut the fuck up. [Rita] I mean, can StayBnB fine us for kicking someone out of our place early? We should at least give them a heads up. [Dennis] So then call them, babe. Don't you have your phone? [Rita] Can I use your charger? Yeah, there should be, uh, one in the glove compartment. Are you serious? What the hell is this? What, what, what? Oh. How long have you had this? Before the trip. Oh, my God, so you've had this the whole time? Why would we have needed this? You said this whole trip was safe. Because we have a gun. We are not gun people. I mean, did you seriously think I was going to travel without any form of protection, huh? - What, are you mad? - I never want to see that thing again. [Somber piano music] [Dennis sighs] [car whirring] I'm, I'm sorry, it's really just what we need right now. - Everything good? - She seemed cool with it. I told her to leave the key under the mat. I still feel bad. Are we doing the right thing? I mean, starting a family is big. Are we just rushing into it? I mean, are we being reckless? Are you having second thoughts? [Somber violin music] And they're still here. Is that them? I mean, someone is here. [Voicemail] You have reached the voice mailbox of - Kate. At the tone-- - [Dennis] Why'd you call? - I don't want to just walk in on them. - Walk in on them? It's our house. [Muffled classical music] What the fuck is that? No key under the mat. [Loud classical music] [Dennis] Is anybody here? - [Music stops] - Thanks. Yeah. Oh, that's a tiny Christmas tree. [Dennis] Hello? Is anybody here? And they left the fucking door open. [Water splashing] - Is someone in there? - [Doorknob rattling] Hey! - Hey! - Dennis, calm down. Calm down? Whoa, you're not kicking down the door! How else are we supposed to get in there? You're not kicking down the door. This is not - an episode of "Cops." - Oh, God. There could be somebody ODing in there. We don't know that. Should be a screwdriver somewhere. That should have been your first option. Fuck! [Dennis] Babe. Yeah? [Dennis] They clogged the fucking disposal. Maybe they're fucking with us. [Chuckles] [eerie music] [dishes rattling] [eerie musical sting] What the fuck? [Birds chirping] ¶ Out there, to make you feel Like you don't have a care ¶ [knocking] - Hi, uh, can I help you? - Uh, Kate? Do I look like a Kate? Did you request a ride? No, I'm sorry, I think you have the wrong house. According to my phone, someone requested a ride from this address. When? It was about 30 minutes ago. Hi, it's Rita, from your StayBnB. My husband and I just got home, and your bags are still here. So, uh, what's up? Just let me know. [Eerie music] I think, uh, you have the wrong house. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But you have a good, uh, a, good evening. Son of a bitch! Fucking drove all the way down here... [muffled by window] What? What? What was that? I'm sorry, I can't hear you. [Tires screech] [phone ringing] [woman on phone] Hello? Hi, Kate? Kate? No. Uh. - Paige Kelly? - Yes, who is this? Oh, hi, Paige, okay, so I have your bag here, and-- - You're her, aren't you? - Excuse me? I saw you! You're the fucking bitch who stole my bag! - I can't believe this. - No, I'm sorry, I didn't-- What, what now? You want a reward? Do you know who I am? - Cameron! Come over here. - Listen, - I don't know what's-- - Listen here, bitch. I'm going to have you speak to my husband. Oh, and you have no idea how bad you fucked up. Cameron! [Cameron] Hello? - Hello? - So, you're the one who stole the bag? [Paige] She has no idea who the fuck she's messing with. [Cameron] Babe? Get the fuck away from me - as I figure this out. - [Paige] Fuck that. Listen, okay, I'm just as confused as you are. My husband and I just got home, and-- [Cameron] Shh. She's gone. Have you opened the bag? No, I can't, it's locked. [Cameron] Good, good. Do yourself a favor, and get rid of the bag as soon as possible. [Hangs up phone] Hello? What was that about? [Sighs] - Do you want a glass of wine? - [Chuckles] Do we even have any? As a matter of fact, we do. What is going on? My thoughts are they took too much of something and are now wandering the streets. But, who are they, though? I mean, what do we even do? Do we call the cops? And say what? We came into an empty house. I mean, sure, everything is a mess, the disposal was broken, but, hey, [chuckles] at least they left us a bottle of wine. And an adorable Christmas tree, in March. That is an adorable Christmas tree, though. I didn't even think they made them that cute. [Chuckles] You know what I want more than anything right now? What? For all this to just go away. I want to start our lives again. Maybe do some remodeling in one of the rooms? Hmm, maybe that can happen after you, you sell your book, which I know nothing about, by the way. I know. Tell me about your book. No holding back. Okay, so, uh, it's called "The Beast Feast." - And this is the children's book? - Yes. - Okay. - So, it's called "The Beast Feast," and it's about this monster who lives in the woods. Is it like a cute monster, or just one that eats your friends and then eats you? Sorry, just go ahead. [Chuckles] So, there's this hungry monster who lives by himself in the woods. And he has this collection of, like, the coolest shit. Like, things that people have left behind over the years, like, he's got this, um, this old watch and this antique toy boat-- Please tell me you're going to add that line about cool shit. [Laughs] I'm sorry, just go ahead. [Eerie music] What is it? Hey. Who the fuck is that? - [Rita] Dennis? - What? We need to go get that gun from the van, now. [Tense music] [whispering] Go, go, go! - I thought we weren't gun people. - That was before there was a man with a fucking axe in our house. [Lock clicking] [sighs] [grunts] Dammit! No, no, no, no. No, this can't be. No, it can't be... Rainstorm. Fuck. Rainstorm. [Screams] - You're back early. - Who the fuck are you? You don't use that thing often, do you? - Of course I do. - No, no. I can just tell. [Tense music] [Dennis] Babe, give me the gun. - Dennis, no. - Don't do this. [Dennis] Stay here. [Dennis] Hey! Man, get to the ground! And put down the fucking axe! Listen, I need you to tell your wife to come down here. What the fuck were you doing in my house with an axe? It isn't safe up there with her. - With who, my wife? - No, Kate. I would suggest you tell your wife to come down here. Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate. Yeah, that chick that trashed our house? - She's unstable. - Unstable? You're the one we found in our house, you're the one that I'm worried about. Do you want to die? Sorry. Rainstorms, rain... Listen. Man, what's wrong with you? Babe, should I call the cops? - Please. - Don't do that. Shut the fuck up! I know how this looks, trust me. But just hear me out. This is how it's going to play out. - Man, you are-- - No. Listen. Your wife is going to call the police. It'll take them approximately 20 minutes to get here. - More than enough time-- - Keep talking. Meanwhile, meanwhile... Kate is going to kill you. All of us. She won't stop until it is a bloodbath. There is absolutely no reason for you to trust the man who just had an axe in your house... but you just have to. Who are you? I'm Kate's boyfriend. Was Kate's boyfriend... when Kate was Kate. So, where's Kate? What is he doing? Dennis, where are you going? Just follow us. - There's no one in there. - Yes, there is. One minute, she was normal, and the next... - Where did she go? - I don't know. We were just enjoying a glass of wine, and before I could react, she just snapped. She knocked me unconscious, and by the time I woke up, she was nowhere to be seen. She did that to you? Oh... it's fine. She just used my head to break open a wine bottle. - Some other things. - Were you all two fighting? No, no. She seemed upset about something. Behavior just seemed uncharacteristic, you know, like-- - Why do you think she's still in the house? - She doesn't know the area, - she couldn't have gone far. - I tried calling her phone. Yeah, her phone's dead. Listen, there's three of us. You don't think we could take her down? Take her down? What the hell? This is insane! - We're not going to-- - [Dennis sighs] Oh, my God. Fuck, okay, look. You seem like a nice enough guy. - He does? - I do? No, course not. No offense. None taken. But all of this, you and your crazy girlfriend, this is not our problem. All of this should not be my problem. What do you want me to do? Kate is out there, somewhere, armed with who knows what? Listen, you two don't want to help me, fine, don't. Your house... did this to her. Something in your house did this to her. - I know I sound crazy. - Yeah, he sounds crazy. Fine, shit. Let's just do what we have to do and get this over with. Keeping the axe, though. [Car door closes] [stairs creaking] What are we doing? [Chance] Kate! - Who's bag is that? - [Chance] I don't know. Why don't you know? [Chance] It's a long story. [Chain jingles] - [Chance] Kate! - No one's here. [Floorboards creaking] [wheels rumbling] Something's wrong with this house. [Eerie music] What is it? You two know something that I don't. I think we just need to focus on finding Kate. I'm a very observant person you know. I can see who people really are. Excuse me? I'm not crazy. Whatever is going on in this house is real. I shouldn't be here. Shouldn't be here. Shouldn't be here. Fuck! Your house has ruined me. You two... have ruined me. I shouldn't still be here. How have we ruined you? Stop. Stop, stop it! Stop what? Stop it, you're not here. You're not here. You're not here. You're not... I think you should leave. [Eerie music] I'm not scared of you. - You know why? - Why? 'Cause I can see who you two really are. And I don't even know you. What is this? What happened to finding Kate? Kate isn't fucking here! And I'm not going to be pulled in to believing she is anymore. I think you need to leave. We're done here. You know what I do see? What? Not even mentioning how everything in this house is baby-proof. It's insane how pitiful it is. I can see two things. One... she wants a baby. And two... you don't. Stranger and I can see that. Get him the fuck out of our house. I feel bad for any kid who has to grow up here with you two. [Fist thuds] Wrong about one thing, it's not that I don't want any kids. [Somber organ music] - Shit. [Stuttering] - I mean, should I-- - It's fine. - I mean, we could do it again. It's fine. It's just that we can't have any. [Rita giggles] What's in the bag? [Lock clacks] Nothing. What do we do with Paige's bag? I say keep it. Paige was a total bitch. [Dennis chuckles] Do I even want to know what's clogging this? What you got hiding back there? Oh, one of our hundreds of unfinished puzzles. You just know me so well, don't you? What do you say? What? Let's do it! We keep buying these puzzles and we always say we want to finish one, so let's just do it. With, with everything that we have going on around here? We don't even know what happened to Kate, Paige Kelly's suitcase, I-- None of that is our problem. Right now, this is our problem. Our 700 problems. Come on, if not now, when? All righty then, let's begin. Let's. [Ceiling rumbling and creaking] Guess it's still here, then. Yeah. [Crickets chirping] [clock ticks] [sinister ambient music] [metal clicking] [Chase on phone] For security reasons, in case I go down, I need you to say everything you just said. [Jill] Why would I do that? [Chase] No one will ever see it but me. I just need it to be... real. My granddaughter is Kate Davis. Her father's last name, not mine. She's the only person who ever visits me here. For that, I am thankful. Due to some unfortunate and tragic circumstances, Kate is my only family member living. And I want you to kill her. [Chance] Do you need more time to think about it? Or... is this your final request? I may not look it, living in this hellhole... but I made a name for myself. I am someone. I will not let her destroy my name. She's an embarrassment. So, yes... it was final when her brother died. [Chance] That is all I needed to hear. As you know, I've been in contact with Kate for half a year now. My plan is to spend a weekend with her. Nothing suspicious. I'll do it when we go to dinner. Make it look like an OD. Won't be hard based off her history. [Chance] That's the plan. Does she love you? [Chance] We never talk about that. She's just coming down for a fun time. [Jill puffs] After you do it, I want you to take a picture, come back, show me. Then I want you to burn that picture. Nothing will ever be said of this again. Understood? [Chance] Why do you need a picture? Because I need it to be real. [Church-bell ringing] [rock music] [instructor] Choose a word, just one word, that brings you peace. Make that your word, and say it when you feel the anger surfacing. Anger management isn't something you download. Rainstorms, rainstorms. Rainstorms. - What is it? - [Chuckles] You look younger than I thought. How old do I look? - What year were you born? - '92. Oh, my God. Don't tell me that. What? You're such a baby. I love it. Well, you look way older than I was expecting. Like 30 years older, at least. Shut the fuck up. - [They chuckle] - Come on, I'm hungry, let's go. Isn't it such a weird feeling? Like, traveling, and all the sudden it's just, boom, you're there. It's just like a completely different mindset. Yeah, and then just being like, - at an ice cream place with somebody. - [Chance laughs] Or, no. I'm fucking bored, let's go. You're just going to leave that? Yeah, why do people work here? All right. ¶ Okay ¶ ¶ Drop that, yeah Feel the funk, y'all ¶ ¶ Yeah, feel the funk, y'all ¶ ¶ Yeah, get laid Back in the car... ¶ Sorry we didn't get to spend Christmas together this year. Yeah, me too. Just came up and I couldn't get away. [Kate] Fucking love Christmas, man. All of it. The decorations, the cheer. The eggnog. All of it. Yeah, it sucks we weren't able to celebrate together. Oh, we'll see about that. About what? I want to do something totally random and unplanned. How do you feel about that? What do you mean? I'm just so tired of schedules and appointments and calendars and... Let's just throw out whatever plans we had for tonight and do something totally different. Uh, yeah, I mean, we do have reservations to a really nice restaurant tonight. Exactly, so, why don't we just go to another really nice restaurant that we don't have reservations for. You know, somewhere just, like, bougie as fuck. Yeah. I mean, the reservations we do have were extremely hard to get, so-- [hand thumps] Why did you do that? We will not succumb to being predictable. Which is why we won't be staying at the hotel tonight. Really? Where are we staying? I like you. If we're not staying at the hotel, I need directions to-- I fucking love this song, man. Oh, my God, this is like the fucking show with the karaoke in the car! ¶ You've got a love that Fills me with desire ¶ Sing the fucking words! I don't know the fucking words. ¶ You are the only one for me ¶ ¶ You are my love ¶ - I don't know it. - [Kate screams] [eerie music] [GPS] In one mile, turn left. Where are you taking us? [GPS] Recalculating. Dammit. Are we close? Because it's spotty service out here. Kate! Yeah, we were supposed to turn back there. Okay, I think we're getting close. I'm sure I could find a spot closer to the house. Why don't we just... park closer? Plenty of street parking. Are we getting close? [Wheels rattling] This is it. Whose house is this? My friend's. Are you being serious? These your friends? [Snoring] [bags clattering] [eerie music] Friends must love puzzles. - [Clock chiming] - [ceiling creaking] [eerie musical sting] You feeling okay? [Water splashing] - [Kate] The fuck? - Kate! [Instructor] Be that person. It's okay not to have all the answers. In fact, not seeing everything in the beginning can actually benefit your growth, as a stronger person. Life doesn't wait for you to catch up. [Serene music] [Chance recording] I'll do it when we go to dinner. [Jill recording] Make it look like an OD. [Huffing] It won't be hard based off her history. [Chance] That's the plan. [Jill] Does she love you? [Chance] We never talk about that. She's just coming down for a fun time. [Muted screaming] [Jill] After you do it, I want you to take a picture. [Sinister ambient music] What the fuck? What were you looking for in the kitchen? You're not taking a long enough bath? [Door clicks open] Sorry about all that. Thought you were taking a bath. Yeah, no, I didn't do that. Do what, take a bath? No, uh, turn it on. I think it's broken. [Chuckles] Did you try turning it off? No. I mean, it's not my water bill. Where did you find that vodka? [Sighs] [sighs] What the hell is that? [Pills rattling] [ice rattles] Did you find what you were looking for? What? Kitchen looks like shit. All the fucking drawers are open. I've already looked. Codeine... Xanax, speed. [Kate] Fucking nothing. This family fucking sucks, man. I thought they were your friends. That was a joke. I mean, I found this place on an app. So you don't know the hosts? ¶ So full of aggression ¶ ¶ Not paying attention ¶ ¶ You got me losing connection ¶ ¶ I'm in a temporary home ¶ By the way... I'm sorry about how I've been acting. It's been... a rough few months, you know? Yeah, I understand. ¶ La, la, la, la La, la, la, la ¶ Have you seen the view? ¶ La, la, la, la La, la, la, la ¶ ¶ I'm in a temporary-- ¶ [geese honking] How much money do you have to make to get a view like this? [Chuckles] You should see my grandparents' lake house upstate. Now that is a fucking good view. [Gentle music] This is good though, I'm-- Money is just money. So, what do your grandparents do? - Ruin the fucking mood, why don't you? - Sorry. My grandma... is like my best friend. She is my best friend. It sucks, man. Just really fucking sucks. Do you ever just want to scream? Like, at the top of your lungs? You know, I've heard that doing that is the best stress reliever ever. Like, better than painkillers. Something to do with the chemicals that are released in your brain whenever you do it. Yeah. Fuck! [Sinister ambient music] [breathing deeply] No. I prefer painkillers still. I have a surprise for you. But you have to go. [Bird squawks and thuds] - What was that? - I don't know. [Clock chimes] Why did you do that? [Kate] Birds are fucking stupid, man. Should we move it, or? I don't know, it's a bird. Like I was saying, I have a surprise for you. But you have to leave first. You can't just leave a dead bird. Let it be, man. It's a fucking bird. I mean, if it really bothers you that much then I'll deal with it. Where am I going to go? I don't even know where we are. Why don't you go to the liquor store? Get a bottle of wine. Hmm? We're going to need it tonight. Fine. [Serene music] [splashing] [disposal grinding] [eerie music] What did you do? What's that smell? I was just trying to-- Did you put the dead bird down the disposal? How was I supposed to know that was going to break it? Why would you do that? How is a dead bird different than putting... chicken down the disposal? Anyway, how about that wine run? Yeah, of course. [Door closes] [door slams] [engine revs] [Rita] This place, it's perfect. It's not just perfect, it's us. [Serene music] [both chuckling] - Okay. - What are we-- - What are we doing? - Yes, yes. - Okay. - Aw, no selfies. Come on, no. My house! [Laughs] [Dennis laughs] - Think I'm finally going to start that book. - Good. How did we find this place? It's everything we wanted. Babe... stop it. I mean, was it cheap for a reason? Who knows? Yeah, I mean, market must be good right now or something. - Right? - Do you think someone died here? Rita, I absolutely think somebody died here. And there and there and right where you're sitting. You're not funny. Seriously though. There's no such thing as ghosts. You've nothing to worry about. Besides, I think we need to finish some, um, some of those puzzles. - Mm. - Yeah. Yeah, we should probably finish the ones we have - before we get any new ones. - Yeah, all of them. Yeah. [Laughs] [Dennis] It's beautiful. [Rita] This is home. [Dennis] This is home. [Dennis] This is home! [Laughs] [crashing and clattering] [eerie music] [crashing and clattering] [Chance] Rainstorms, rainstorms. What? [Classical music] Kate! Kate. Hey. Surprise. Wow. What is with that tiny Christmas tree? Oh, well, uh, we didn't get to spend Christmas together this year, so I figured I'd just bring Christmas to us. Hmm? "Dreaming of a White Christmas" is our song. [Chuckles] I think it's just "White Christmas." Who's the other glass for? It's for Bing. Bing? Like, Bing Crosby? And our tree, Bing. Of course, the tree's name is Bing. Right, so, one for me... and... [glasses clink] ...one for Bing. Okay. Drink. Celebrate love. [Chuckles] - Well, looks like we have plenty of wine. - No. [Chuckles] We're going to need another bottle before the end of the night. [Clattering] So... are you on the naughty list? - I am. - Hmm? [Lips smacking] [eerie musical sting] [Kate] What is this? It's a... What is that? It's, um, it's uh... You are on the naughty list, aren't you? Excuse me? [Laughs] What is this? You know what? Wait, don't even tell me. I want it to be a surprise. Kate... - you need to-- - Actually, can you just go get my bag in the bathroom? Sure. [Clicks tongue] [laughs] It can't be this easy, can it? [Girl] Dad? What the fuck? [Eerie music] [rumbling] - [light clicks] - Dennis. I had another nightmare. It's getting worse. I think it's the house. - [Disco music] - [disposal clattering] [eerie music] [Dennis sighs] We need help. [Rumbling] [classical music] Kate! [Kate] I'm out here. Hey, what are you doing out here? [Kate] Taking in the view as if it were my last. You know, I think I'm going to check myself into rehab. I feel controlled. No, I think you're fine. [Chuckles softly] You know that nice bag in there? I stole it from the airport. [Dennis] Why would you do that? No reason, just impulse. I saw it and I wanted it, so I took it. Why did you-- [Chance breathing deeply] Let's stop being controlled, hmm? [Door slams] - Have you lost your mind? - No. In fact, I think I've finally found it. You're still going to drink wine? Yeah, I didn't say anything about giving up on alcohol. [Girl] Dad? Did you hear that? What? [Girl] Bye, Daddy. That, did you hear that? Are you feeling okay? [Screaming] [eerie music] Hey... you're scaring me. She's here. [Somber music] Who? [Girl giggles] My daughter. Where? Right there. [Water gurgling] [Kate] I don't see anything. [Thudding] [Kate] You're alive. What happened? I don't know. But I'm glad I threw that needle away. I don't think I was ready for that trip. I don't think it was-- Shh. I think we're done. You and me. What? The people who own this house are on their way back early. They called this morning while you were still asleep. And I told them that we would be out by this afternoon. Why? [Kate sighs] I feel like... it's just time for us to move on. I feel like this is just not something that's meant to be. I mean, you're a really toxic person. And you obviously have some things to work out on your own. [Eerie ambient music] [device buzzes] So, what do we do if they tell us the house is haunted? Don't say that word. - What, haunted? - [Rita] Shh. So? What is it? This can't be good. They haven't even said anything yet. Which is exactly why this can't be good. Wait, where are you going? [Group chattering] [man] We need to leave. We need to go, go! [Peaceful guitar music] ¶ I feel all The romance in the stars ¶ ¶ Surrounded by a universe ¶ ¶ With the Moon and Mars ¶ ¶ I feel it ¶ ¶ Ah, will you stay with me ¶ ¶ Under the moonlight ¶ ¶ Ah, We'll be Magical as we dream ¶ ¶ Ah ¶ ¶ You won't know till you try ¶ ¶ Under the moonlight ¶ ¶ It wouldn't be The same without you here ¶ ¶ You're my gravity ¶ ¶ That levels all my fears ¶ ¶ Let's slip away Far away from all this noise ¶ ¶ Alone with our shadows ¶ ¶ Feel our hearts beating warm ¶ ¶ I feel it Ah, will you stay with me ¶ ¶ Under the moonlight ¶ ¶ Ah, We'll be Magical as we dream ¶ ¶ Ah ¶ ¶ You won't know till you try ¶ ¶ Under the moonlight ¶ - Babe? - Hmm? Why is there an axe next to our bed? Tired of being scared of my own home. I think it's time we embrace it. All of it. [Sighs] You know, you're something special. [Water pouring] Are you okay? I'm fine. - It's kind of early. - I'm sorry for saying that. Saying what? Saying that you were toxic. I'm literally the last person to call anyone toxic. It's okay. To this weekend? To this weekend showing me the truth. [Glass clinking] What happened last night? After I passed out. Oh, well, um... I saw the video on your phone of my grandma. [Snorts] [eerie music] What? After you passed out, my phone died and I was going to use yours to call for help. I mean, it was in your jacket. The video was just on the screen when I opened it. I'm not mad. [Unzips bag] Your grandma wanted me to kill you this weekend. How are you not mad? Because, I was going to do that this weekend, anyway. With you. What? I've never felt so connected to a stranger. This was just meant to be. What was meant to be? You and me. I wanted us to end up like Romeo and Juliet. Could you not feel that? [Chance vomiting] What are you doing? Just let it happen! I thought we were supposed to be together. You are fucking insane! - [Glass crashes] - [Chance gasping] I just don't think you know what you're looking for yet. - [Water gurgling] - [gasping] [water splashing] It's like starting a long, complicated puzzle. [Dennis gasping] It's not always going to be clear at first. [Chance gasps] [eerie music] [Jill recording] 'Cause I need it to be real. [Kate] Are you looking for this? I guess you need a picture of me... for proof, right? What are-- What are you doing? How are you-- Shit, my phone. [Dennis] We need to do something. What can we do? I mean, we can't afford any of our options. - We should move. - Again, we can't afford any of our options. Moving isn't something that just happens overnight. Okay, realistically, no, but, yeah, you're right. Let's just leave. - [Dennis] And go where? - [Rita] Anywhere. We can put this place up on one of those vacation rental apps. Like a, a StayBnB, I could rent out the vacation house, make a little money, and then-- But then who would want to stay at a haunted house? [Kate] What are you doing? You're not real. [Kate] You're not going to get away. [Chance] Yes, I am. You heard the paranormal investigators. Said this place feeds on negative energy. [Kate] You don't have your phone with the video. Come on, man, get it together. You're not real. I just ordered a ride from my dead phone, but I'm dead, so I guess that makes sense, doesn't it? - [Dennis] Bullshit. - [Rita] Is it, though? I mean, we're not the most positive couple. Maybe we just need some time away. Rainstorm. You're scared, not angry. There's a difference. Rainstorm. Rainstorms aren't going to take away your fear. We'll say it's negative energy. Come on, we need this. Okay, so let's just say somebody stays here and gets spooked out. [Rita] I don't know, people on vacation don't usually have a lot of negative energy. [Dennis] Really? I don't know, what's the worst that could happen? [Classical music] You're not really here. That's not my phone. You keep saying that I'm not here, but... [chuckles] I'm still here. How's that going for you? Kate! [Kate laughs] Kate... give me my phone. Open the fucking door! [Jill recording] My granddaughter is Kate Davis. Her father's last name, not mine. She's the only person who ever visits me here. [Kate] You're really going to axe down the door? You're doing a really messy job. You're going to get caught. Stop it. [Gentle music] Why don't you just go away? I never learned how to swim. Did you know that about me? I don't know a lot about you. We're just strangers. Do you feel that? No. I'm sorry. [Kate] For what? What happened to you. It wasn't personal. I'm not mad. You're going to get caught. [Dennis] Hello? - They're back. - [Dennis] Is anybody here? The phone is in the house. And unless you want to get caught, I suggest you go find it. Do you feel that? Rainstorms. Rainstorm. I'll let you know when it's safe to go. [Dennis] And they left the fucking door open. [Fist thuds] [somber keyboard music] ¶ I've been in some places ¶ ¶ That I cannot forget ¶ - [tires screeching] - [car thumps] ¶ Sometimes nameless faces ¶ ¶ Can be your best friends ¶ [sniffling] ¶ I've been in some places ¶ [panting and screaming] ¶ That I didn't leave yet ¶ Stop it! ¶ Sometimes the holy sunrise ¶ ¶ Is your only... ¶ What are you doing? Go. I'm back. You know what you have to do. ¶ Waiting to reach the coast ¶ ¶ Waiting to free their loads ¶ I'm sorry. [Clock ticks] [bullets clicking] Hey. Hey. [Light clicks] [Rita] What's going on? - Oh, oh, whoa. - Oh, my God! [Rita] He's going to kill us! [Dennis] We're going to be fine. I need your phone. Man, just, please. Where's your phone? It's right here, it's right there. I just need your phone. [Chance] It'll all be over soon. [Distant pop music] [Rita sobbing] Listen, please. Are you going to kill us? [Tense music] [phone rings] [Robert on phone] Fountain Creek Nursing Home, Robert speaking. Uh, yes, I'm sorry, who is this? My name is Robert, I'm an RN here at Fountain Creek. Oh. May I ask who's calling? - Sir? - I'm trying to get through to Jill, she there? - No. - I have information regarding her granddaughter, Kate. Um, I'm sorry, may I ask who's calling? Could I speak to her in private? I'm sorry to be the one to break this very sad news to you, but Jill passed away last night in her sleep. Oh. She was truly a hero in this community and she will be greatly missed. Last night? - I'm sorry, who is this? - It's okay. We're putting money together for a park bench - to memorialize Jill. - My condolences. I'm sorry, I couldn't catch your name. It's fine. Were you close to Jill? This whole thing came as a-- [phone beeps] [Chance screams] [girl] Dad? What's wrong? [Gentle keyboard music] You're not really here. [Girl] Why won't you look at me? Rainstorm. Rainstorm. [Girl] Is this a game? Rainstorms. [Girl] Should I leave? [Breathing deeply] You're not her. - [Horn honks] - [Chance screams] [cabinet slams] [chain jangles] Where do you think you see yourself in two years? That's a loaded question. [Chuckles] For one, I hope to have two books written. Two books, that sounds easy. [Chuckles] How about you? Mm. For starters, no more sleepwalking. That is a heavy question. I'm hoping this time - you can show me what I've been missing. - Hmm. What about kids? - What about them? - Do you think we'll have them in two years? I mean, I'm thinking in two years anything is possible. [Fly buzzing] [Rita] It's up here somewhere. - I can't-- - [Dennis] Just scoot back. - [Rita] Okay. - [Dennis] All right. [Rita] I feel like my-- Fuck. [Groaning] Oh shit, here. I-- Fuck, where is it? Oh, I felt it. Wait, it's up here. I think I can get it with my foot. - [Dennis] Hold on. Let me move you. - [Rita] Okay. - [Sighs] I almost got it, let's just get a little closer, okay? - [Dennis] All right. - [Rita groaning] - [Dennis] Aw, fuck. [Rita] Okay, where are you? Okay, that's it, that's it. Come on, come on. - Yes! - [Dennis] Okay, it's there. - [Rita laughs] Okay. It's there. - [Dennis laughs] It's right here, shit. [Rita] Oh, my God, I think he's dead. [Dennis] Just don't look. How are we going to explain all this to the police? I don't know. But they're on their way, though, okay? Hey, hey, hey, Rita, we're okay. Hey, just, just tell me about your book. - What, now? - I want to hear about it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I don't even remember where I was. There's a crazy monster in the woods with cool shit. Right, yeah. [Huffing] Okay. Okay, there's, um, a very hungry monster in the woods with all this cool shit, yeah, and, and he's seen it all. Everything, um, over the years. Even though he's been confined to the woods his whole life, he's seen, um, people getting proposed to... um, teenagers and their crazy dares, and children taking their first steps. Um, [sniffles] everything, good and bad, all of it. What else? He's, um, he's very hungry all the time, no matter how much he eats, and he's also lonely. [Gentle piano music] All he wants in the world, more than anything, more than all of his treasure is someone to share it with. But he can't have that because he's so scared that his temptation will get the best of him and he'll eat them. [Sniffles] So, he doesn't even try... until this little girl shows up at his front door. And then what happens? I don't know. That's all I got. [Distant sirens blaring] I think we should adopt. - What? - Yeah. [Music intensifies] I mean, can we-- Are we ready? Can we raise a child in this place? We live in a fucking haunted house for crying out loud. - Can we do that? - [Chuckles] Yeah. Look, I'm not sure. But there's always going to be something. Ours just happens to be a haunted house with crazy shit. But it's ours. And everything else is just a cool, unscary, cute monster. But with you, I know that monster can be tamed. [Dennis laughs] [police sirens approaching] [engines revving] ¶ Hey little voodoo child You've got me running wild ¶ ¶ You make me feel alive, oh ¶ ¶ The devil in my dreams Dancing in front of me ¶ ¶ Make me want to believe, oh ¶ ¶ I feel your heart And soul, perfectly in control ¶ ¶ Put everyone in Your spell, now ¶ ¶ So lay it on me child You know you drive me wild ¶ ¶ You've got me Feeling like, oh ¶ ¶ She make me feel alive Make me feel alive ¶ ¶ She make me feel All right, she makes me ¶ ¶ She make me feel alive Make me feel alive ¶ ¶ Oh, 'til you come back home ¶ ¶ Until you come back home ¶ ¶ Until you come back home ¶ ¶ 'Til you come back home ¶ [gentle ambient music]
