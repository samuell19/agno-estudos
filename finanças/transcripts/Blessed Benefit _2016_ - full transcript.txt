Please don't tell anyone about this. The whole neighborhood already knows! The whole neighborhood? Who told you? Forget it. Nobody knows. Exactly. Half the neighbors did it. I didn't do the job for them. They extended it themselves? Who told you? - Nobody. - I'm doing this as a favor. Is this a tree clipper? Just let me work! What's wrong? Why are you barefoot, darling? It's too dark inside. Wasn't dinner at my parents better than this? Why are you mad? I already told you I have an important meeting tonight. You always have important meetings! You have to visit my parents, they want to see you. I can't tonight, at all. But I already told them we're coming tonight. Apologize to them. Apologize again? Then don't apologize! There'll be no mercy in this game! It's the fifth time he's calling. I don't know what to tell him. He's already waited for three weeks, he can wait another day. You've been saying this for 3 weeks! I can't make a living because of you. I'll solve it tomorrow. The custom's guy promised that it will be done by tomorrow 10 am. If you don't pay him under the table, the laptops will rust and you'll be wasting your time! You're right, Abu Sameer, you have to pay him, and that's why you'll pay the price with this King! Should I be stuck with this card? Who else, me? - Good for you. - You don't know how to play. Do you have diamond cards? None. Show me. Forget about my cards, you don't know how to play!

What's wrong with Mom? Why? Ok, lock the door, I'll be home soon. Ok, bye, darling. Is everything ok? As usual, my wife got mad. We were supposed to visit her parents, and we didn't. The girls are home alone? Yes. We're done for tonight! Leave. Don't forget about tomorrow. The guy filed a lawsuit against me. Don't worry. Make some room, guys. Please, guys. - Hello. - Hello. Your ID, please. Who are you? Criminal investigation. Can I see your ID? Sure, it is your right. Never mind. Here you go, sir. - Ahmad Taher? - Yes. Can you please come with us? What is wrong?

Hello. Cousin, listen. I don't have time for hellos and all that. Come take the car, its next to the juice shop opposite the phone shop. The key is inside. Where am I going? It's your fault! I got dragged by the ants! Sir, can I have a cigarette? I wish it was up to me but it's not allowed, do you see the camera up there? Will I go to court today? It won't be till tomorrow. What? I'm staying here till tomorrow? No. I'll take you to a bigger cell downstairs. Can you take me now? I want to sleep. You need to wait till someone joins you. You ruined my life! You know the law, it's your fault. Stop it now. Didn't you see me coming from behind? How could I see you? I wasn't in the car! It's your fault! You hit the rear of my car! Stop it, guys. Not a single word. Don't talk till I ask you to. Tell me what happened. Sir, I was driving all peacefully, and he suddenly popped out in front of me. I was parked there for 5 hours! You think I can afford wasting 5 hours! Do you know how much it costs for a taxi to park for 5 hours? I hit the brakes 5 meters away from your car. You wrecked it after I fixed it. The bumper was new sir! I followed the rules. According to the law, it's your fault, since you hit my rear! And who dripped the oil on the street! I don't know about the oil. Guys. - It was like a new bride, sir. - You suddenly popped up in the street. - You hit my rear! - Stop it, guys. Guys, just relax for a minute. I think it's the mechanic's fault for dripping the oil. Need anything, old man? Yes, a cigarette, please! Give him a cigarette, sir. He's sitting there like a chicken. Have some mercy, he's a human being. Stop blabbering, another word and you'll be joining him. Wait outside for the patrol officer. Not another word. Give me a 100 Dinars and I'll call it a day. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. God! Finally someone joins me. What brought you here? I finished a year's sentence yesterday. What were you in for? Forged checks. You spent a year inside? Was it worth it? The checks bought me 4 cars. If I worked a whole year... I won't even be able to buy a tire! That's true! What about you? Nothing serious. I'll be out tomorrow, when my cousin pays bail. Good morning. Good morning! Just in time, your papers are ready. Really? Yes, it's just missing the manager's signature. Your file is on his desk. It's just missing one signature. Ok, get it signed. He's off today. It's his son's wedding today. I wish he was here, I could have congratulated him. He would've liked that. Listen I've been running back and forth for a while and it's a new story everyday. Please help me get the laptops released. It's not up to me, you know that. But it's in his hand now and he's busy with the wedding these days and Eid holiday is coming up and he has to get lots of sheep for feasts for a lot of guests and the sheep should be local because imported sheep are tasteless and the local markets only have imported sheep. You're right, no point of a feast without local sheep! - It's an embarrassment. - Exactly! You're right! - It will be fine. - God willing. So, Salameh, where did you find the Islamic center receipts? I found them on the street, sir. You found them on the street? Cut the crap, smart ass!

So, don't push me too far, and tell me the truth. - Where did you get them from? - I printed them, sir. You should've said that from the start.

Just knock on the door for anything you need, I am available. What do you do? A contractor. Man... I started building a room on my roof but ran out of money. I don't know what to do. I'd help, but I'm off to prison. I'll keep them standing till a miracle happens! Sir, can I make a call? It's not allowed, but here, make it quick. Hello. Tell my cousin to come to Tareq station urgently. Guys, I'm collecting money to buy us dinner. Each has to pay 2.5 Dinars. It will get us a decent dinner. Let's all pitch in, so we can eat. Do you want to pay for dinner? No, thanks. As you like! Did you check that apartment for rent? I did, but it has no balcony. The balcony isn't important. We need to leave this apartment. But this one is closer to Mom's house. That's why we should leave. Ahmad Taher Farraj. Is my cousin here? What cousin? Didn't you ask me for food? Yes, food and cigarettes. So give me 7 Dinars. 5 is enough. No problem, you'll get the food soon. But don't tell anyone that you paid me. Why, is food illegal here? Just do as you're told! How much did you pay him? 5 Dinars. If you paid me you would've saved a lot. - He pockets the rest! - So what. Osama Melhim Qaddoura. - Did you take the goods? - Yes, sir. Did the plaintiff drop the charges? No, sir.

He bought himself a life insurance policy. And next day faked his own death and issued his own death certificate and in return got 100,000 Dinars! Wow! How did he fake it? He spoofed his brother's identity. He looks a lot like him. There is no evidence proving he's still alive. He agreed with his wife that she'd collect the money. When she found out that he made his brother the only beneficiary she went insane, so she reported him and he ended up here. He's an idiot! An ass, a mule! That's why we call him Dead Man. The problem is he's worthless and arrogant. A bed wetter and wants to sleep in the middle? Good one! Guys, the warden is coming for a visit. Listen carefully and focus. Let's all sing together.

Guide us to the straight path The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked Your anger or of those who are astray. Amen. By the morning brightness and by the night when it covers with darkness, Your Lord has not taken leave of you, O Muhammad, nor has He detested you. And the Hereafter is better for you than the first life. And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied. Did He not find you an orphan and give you refuge? And He found you lost and guided you, And He found you poor and made you self-sufficient. So as for the orphan, do not oppress him. And as for the petitioner, do not repel him. But as for the favor of your Lord, report it. - God is Great. - God is Great. Finally! You've been promising me to call for 2 months! When you buy a dongle here, it works as soon as you get home!

Bastards! Our beloved Mor, our darling Mor. The best shop, that once was a shop. Let's hear, the robbery! Listen If you need a job once you're out, I'll find you one. I'm not blessed with honest money, how about with dishonest? Dishonest? You think I was born a fraud? My first time in jail, I was falsely accused. Aren't you tired of this life? I tried and I am not supposed to be here now. It's my wife's fault! She got me tracked from the new internet connection she got. Damn that dongle! Like an idiot, I got her a new laptop! Don't even mention laptops. They ruined my life. Look at me, I'm here cleaning rice! I got a golden opportunity, 10 new laptops, I couldn't resist! 10 laptops? The idiot imported them from Canada. God damn you! You screwed me over! What's wrong, guys? Calm down, Ahmad. - What's wrong? - He's stole the laptops from my cousin! - Calm down, guys. - Calm down. Here's your tea. Get the hell out of here! - I don't want tea. - Fine, don't drink it! Get out of here! What's up with you? You didn't go to the yard today. Come on, Mor, cheer up! The Holy land has been taken and no one got upset and you're upset about a tiny shop? - Hello. - Welcome. Sir, I'm here for my laptop. Come in a week. Why after a week? I am sure you have the laptop. It's in the safe department. Look? All these are robbery inventory files and this takes time. Please help me. I can't keep running around. The officer told me I'll take it today. Come back in 3 days. This is a personal favor to you. Leave now. Don't huff and puff. Leave! We have work to do! Ahmad Taher Farraj. You're released. YOU'LL ALWAYS BE MOR, OUR LEADER. CELL W6, AHMAD Will you help me finish building the room on my roof? Buy the materials and I won't charge you for my fee. How about you buy the materials and I'll pay you back in installments. Of course not? That way I'll be plowing on a rooster! Then I'll leave them as they are! How are you? I remember what you used to do to our teacher in school? Look at you now, you became a mayor! I didn't expect you'll become a mayor. I'm still aiming for even higher ranks! Your biggest ambition was to be a mechanic or a car electrician. I have no idea how you became mayor! - Remember the good old days? - Of course I do! - Ahmad Taher Farraj. - Yes, sir. You and the likes of you are ruining our country. I'm giving you 3 months probation. I didn't ruin anything. I know a man in prison if he gets out he'll ruin the country! Get the hell out of my face! Stop. Give me your hands. Why? I got released! I have to hand you back to the station I received you from and from there you can go home. It'll take an hour and you'll go back home. Why are you in a hurry? We're having fun. - Ok. - Ok? What are you guys in for? National security. Sir? I should be transferred under minimum security, why am I with them? You're right, but they are on our way! Hello. Yes. Raise your voice! Raise your voice! What? Hello. Hello. What? What did you say? Guys, please put on your handcuffs before we get to the station. Hello. Raise your voice! What did you say? Is he mad because you took off your cuffs? No, we always do this, we want to smoke. I'm on my way. Don't touch a thing. Damn, I'm screwed! I'm screwed! Are you ok? How can I be ok? My house got robbed! Oh, Salem! You're screwed!
