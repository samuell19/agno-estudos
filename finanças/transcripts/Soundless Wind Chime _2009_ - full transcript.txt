It's the silence that I miss the most. I miss it so much that I've forgotten what it sounds like. Pascal... Pascal... He's not going to make it. A long time ago, in the middle of the night, a man on a bicycle rode along the shores of the Bay of Uri. He got lost and so he vanished for 18 years. Nobody knew where he was and nobody helped him. But one night the moon shone so brightly on the bay that a ray of silver showed him the way home. His family immediately understood that he had come home one last time. He waved them good-bye and at dawn he vanished forever. - Delivery service. - Finally! - How much is that? - 22 dollars. - Keep the change. - Thanks. - Wonton noodles to go. - Okay. What took you so long? The delivery is round the corner. Ricky. Get me 2 bottles of soy sauce. There you are. That guy over there. The foreigner. Excuse me. Your ID card please! You have one, right? You should've called for help! Someone would've helped you. And the police would've stopped him. Say something! Hurry up! I've gotta go back to bed. Come on, the traffic light is turning red. I'm going home. You know how to get a new ID card? - So, what did you get? - Nothing. Shit! What happened? I nearly got caught. Damn! What's this, eh? What's? Give it back! It's gonna be cold. Put on a jacket. I'll call you back. Wait, he just came home. Do you want to talk to him? - Who is it? - Your mom of course. Hi, Mom. I just came home from work. I had something to eat. I showed my clients how to invest in shares. How are your joints? Any better? Did you go to the doctor? What did he say? Why don't you go to the hospital in the city? They're better equipped Take care!. Bye-bye. I think she's really sick. The neighbors cook every day for her. Call her when you've got the time. Have a seat. What would you like? Something to drink? Iced tea with milk, no sugar. Iced tea, no sugar. Iced tea, no sugar. Are you looking for someone? Oh, he forgot his wallet. Do you live nearby? Girls, you're early. Stop ... Who the hell is that? A friend. Keep quiet while I've got a customer up there. So annoying! Sit down, my dear. - Does someone else live here? - Another girl. Let's do a threesome. Forget it. She's out. Let's get started. He's good! Where did you meet him? Is he from the Moscow circus? He should jump through a burning hoop. He can juggle and talk at the same time. Bravo! Bravo! You're good too. - Please come back soon, my dear. - Sure. You're very busy. How long is your friend going stay? What's up? Never saw a naked woman before? Are you fooling around with the guy? So you're gay? Your mom can never come to Hong Kong. I don't know what she'd do, if she saw what we're doing. - Who's next? - It's me. Not there. - Bingo! Payday! - Never. That's not fair. You're cheating. Payday ... Where are you going? He's got a job interview tomorrow. - Tomorrow you'll get your good-luck charm back. - And now get out of here. - Out with it! Payday! He said he used to be a baby-sitter. But he doesn't look very friendly. What if he frightens the kids? All foreigners look like that. Besides, he'd be working part-time so we wouldn't have to pay him any benefits. He wouldn't have to teach anyways. And we could show the parents that we have an English native speaker. That would be good for our reputation. We could find someone cheaper through the job agency. - But he's ... - That's enough. He's OK. Tell him, he can start on Monday. Wait, Ricky. Here's one last delivery. Delivery service. Did you order anything? Did you order anything? Did you order anything, Ma'am? Sit down ... have a seat ... There are chop sticks ... in the kitchen ... 28 dollars, please. I'm not hungry. I can't walk. Sit down. Hello ... Ricky? What took you so long? That woman has Parkinson's. Could I get two dishes of wonton? 2 dishes of wonton to go. - Here are your earnings for today. - Thanks. - That was a fun night! - Bye! Hi. Can I help you? This one too. Why did you do that? Oh my god, it's been ages. - How are you? - Thanks! Cheers! Hey, that drink is from him. - Hi, I'm Steve. - I'm Ricky. How do you do, Ricky? Would you like to go now? The door is open. Come in! Slowly ... careful ... Here ... wipe it off. - How much is it? - 32 dollars. Keep the change. Close the door when you leave. Would you like some noodles or the fried rice? Pascal! How are you? I've been looking for you everywhere. I though you had gone back to Switzerland. What have you been doing? I have a job now. Pascal, aren't you going to give me a hug? Pascal, aren't you going to give me a hug? I love you! I'm sorry! I want to see you again. Oh my god! Are you OK? They're for the journey. The food in the train is too expensive. Give the watch to your uncle. And eat the cake before it gets stale. Did you pack your jacket? It's going to be cold when you arrive. Do you have enough money? Call me if your mother gets worse. I'll try to come later. Where is your boyfriend? Isn't he coming? He's at work. Has he found a job? What is he doing? He's an English teacher. Really? I thought he spoke French. You mean German. Everybody thinks all foreigners speak English. Good for him. This book belonged to my mom. What? Tell him I said Hi! Mom, I just got home. Are you feeling better? The letter finally arrived. The money was still there. I know, I know ... Don't forget your meds. If it doesn't get any better, you've got to go to the doctor's again. Or you should go to the hospital in the city. Ok. Take care, Mom. Bye! Wonton noodles. What? I ordered noodles with beef. That's for table 3. I said 3. What's this? This is damn hot! Are you trying to kill me? I'll get a towel. Ricky, come here! Didn't you get any sleep last night? Go home and have a lie-in! Come on, clean that up! Would you like to kiss me? We'd like to pick up that backpack. Could I please see your ID? It's 5 years old. It's been a while. I'll go and see if I can find it. You're lucky. The backpack was still there. Thank you! I need you to sign for it. - Good morning! - Morning! You speak Cantones very well by now. Ricky, open the door. These 3 times a day, those 4 times, 2 pills each. This will get the fever down. Give here one of these before bedtime and she'll sleep better. Her legs are weak, help her get up. Give her a sponge bath every day. Rub her off very often. Take good care of her. Best wishes! Auntie called yesterday. She wanted to know how you were. She's bought two tickets so she can visit you in two weeks time. How much is it? 5 dollars? Are you going to Tian Tong Yuan? - Would you like a ride? - Yes. - How much is it? - 6 dollars. - How about 5? - OK, let's go. Where do you want to go? Heizhima Hutong. - OK. Get in. Who's there? Hello. Come in, Come in ... Have a seat. He's my son, I'm his mother. My name is Yu-hua. What's yours? What's your name? My name is Yu-hua. What's your name? He's at work. He'll be back at 7 o'clock. The milk bottles got broken. Wake up, Ricky. Let's have breakfast. In memory of ...
