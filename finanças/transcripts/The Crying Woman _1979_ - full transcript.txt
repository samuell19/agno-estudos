THE CRYING WOMAN Dominique! Dominique! How are you? Is Lola sleeping? - What a nice jacket. - Yes. - You just bought it? - Yes, with what I've earned. Lola's sleeping. You're a dog. You say you're going for three days and show up ten days later. Dog. Hold me for a second. I want you to love me. Look at her, she's sleeping. - What nonsense have you learned? - "Ya bo ya". That's not funny. - "Yupaya". - What? - "Yupaya. " - "Yupaya?" - What's that? - "Ya ya ya. " What's that? "Ya bo ya. " "Ya bo ya?" I can't! I can't! I can't. It's fine... Everything's fine, nothing bad has happened. She's sleeping. You have no reason to shout like that. Go to sleep. - I know it's my fault. - It's nobody's fault. What do you want to do? Nothing, just, go to sleep. What do you want to do? I want you to talk to me about this girl. It won't do any good. She's just a girl... What do you want me to tell you? Is she better than me? She's much better, much more intelligent, much funnier, better tits, a better ass... What do you want, to hurt me a little more? Does it help? - How old is she? - 32. - How's that? - It's better than you. Is that what you want to know? What's the meaning of this? Do you want a police report? I don't want anything, no report! Don't you know what we're feeling, what good does this do? What good does it do? To hurt me more? You're making me nervous! - Stop! - Come to bed. In every way, I mean shit to you. I've lived my life in fear of people, of everything, of nothing... And I don't want to fear everything with you. - No? - What are you? You're an asshole and you act like one! Come here. Let's make love. Shit, help me out a little! We haven't made love well, but you've masturbated me just fine. You're only a hand and a dick. Hi Jacques! Hello, precious. Hello, precious. - Can we draw? - If you want. Here, on this side. I've written you a letter. "Forgive me, I need so much to be loved.. Finding the words... it's hard to write. We will try to carry on. For you it's easy, for me it's a battle, few women can do it. I will persevere, I will try. " I'll stick it out until the end of this relationship. I'm sick of not finishing what I've started. We're going to throw another, we'll leave that for her. Do you want to throw one? Catch it and throw it. - No. - You don't want to? - I'll throw it. - Go ahead. I'm going to trash myself a little, that will help you, it will liberate you, so you can spit at me. The other day, in the pastry shop, there was a woman. She served me, and... she touched me a lot, she seemed to me... very sweet, very pretty and... I dreamt of secret letters, a discreet rendezvous... all that romantic stuff. Do you see what kind of guy you're with? - Does it help you? - You love nothing less than me. Be an asshole. We spend years together and you can't tell me that you want me, and you fall in love with the first woman you see. - I know it's not funny. - Quit the bullshit. I ask you to talk about her and I can see that you only talk of yourself. "Me, me, me," always. I can't talk to you about her without talking to you about me. I would prefer that you were. Alright, if you can stand it, if you don't feel too bad... "If I don't feel too bad," but... This whole business with you worrying about me is new, no? "Au. " "Au. " - "Unn. " - "Unn. " - "Erm. " - "Erm. " Do you know that I have to go? But you shouldn't worry because you know that nothing will be as beautiful as you. Give me a kiss? Will you do me a kiss? Yes, wait. Wait... A kiss. Wait for me to finish. A kiss... Give me a kiss? How good you are. I'm going to go in a bit. Give me a kiss? You don't hate me? Give me a kiss? You're going to work. I'm going to work, perhaps it's not true, but we pretend it's like that, right? Goodbye, my girl. You're staying here? Are you going to sleep? Don't worry, eh? Mom worries when I leave, but you won't worry. Alright? Confide in me. Don't stay here, go in the house. To see you go? Thank you. Every time I need you, you go. - What do you want, for me to stay? - No, no I don't. I don't want you to stay. Go... Just go. - It's not so bad. - Should I stay? Come here. Sometimes I can be a little brave. It's not so hard for you. And tell her I appreciate her, come here. You don't know her, you hate her. I don't hate her! Yes, I hate her. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I feel nervous. I feel nervous! You're making me nervous! He's going. Draw the curtain. I'm coming. Draw the curtain. Adulterous man, can I rent out your flat? Our flat is very good. It'll be the first time you rent it. It irks me to love you. And you think this is funny to me? But, what have I done? You ask me to apologize for loving you. Sorry. - And admire the wallpaper. - I love the wallpaper. I'm always in the ideal posture for seeing it, it's beautiful. Before I left I was going to see Christian. I told him that she was in love with you. He told me that she was right. That if he was a girl he would also love you. I asked him why he'd have to be girl. It's true. I want everyone to be in love with you. Do you want to see my room? I want to see your room. This is your room. - It's pretty. - My room. Can you stay a little? - Tonight? - Tomorrow. After tomorrow. But I'll only believe it when you wear pajamas. If you're a man, return in pajamas. You'll see, incredulous woman. - Are you going to have dinner? - Yes, I'm going. I'm unpacking some things and then I'll go. Hi, Dominique. Don't look for Lola's slipper, I have it with me. And don't shout at me anymore. Yes, I know already, I'm an asshole. I want you to dial the number where I am. It's 750706. Take note: 750706. A kiss. Why don't you go to the gynecologist? To see why you can't get pregnant. - I was there the other day. - And what did he say? That if I wanted to, I could, that my only problem was to free my mind. That when I want, it'll function. - There won't be sealed lips? - No. When it's like that, there'll only be one solution, blowing inside and... You don't want to cut it open. How vulgar. I spend my life in the beds of vulgar women. I can't find one who's not like that. - And you, with the lips? - I was joking. I love the expression: "sealed lips," and also the "sag of organs. " What else do you like? - "End of the puerperium. " - Enough! When will you give me a son? I've already told you what they've told me. And I believe it. You have to make me want it. And I don't make you want it? If you close your eyes and then open them, desire will come to you, but if you think of another guy much stronger, I'll compensate, but on the condition that you think about a baby. Go to hell! - Breeding blackmailer. - You only do it for pleasure. - Blackmailing breeder. - To hell with pleasure. - Breeder and blackmailer? - Yes. Why do you want to get me pregnant? Is your woman not letting you or what? You're dishonest. If I had said it to you in a more poetic way, you would have liked to talk about children. But you're annoyed only because I'm joking, correct? Two consecutive times, did I believe you were a young man? Normally no, but tonight yes. Can I believe it? You'll have to see it. But slowly, like a young man. I couldn't tell Dominique your age, curious, right? - She asked me and I said 32. - Ah, yes? As if I couldn't say... - Can I say 34? - No. Good, then 33 and 34. I was incapable of telling your age. I thought it was kind of obscene... to say... What? That I was going to see a woman who was a little wrinkled. - And you believe that you're new? - No. - Perhaps fresher? - Not much. Look at yourself. Shit, the telephone. Stay here. I'll put you next to mirror, in your place. The older women next to the mirror. Yes? - What's going on? - Lola has fallen. She can move, so it won't be anything huge. Good... Get to the hospital, we'll meet there, they'll give her an x-ray. Calm down, it's not a time to... leaving yourself get carried away by hysteria. - Yes. - See you soon. The girl has fallen on her head. - I don't like this at all. - Perhaps it will be nothing. But I don't like this at all. They've already seen her, it's nothing. They've given her an x-ray. I was a little alarmed, but it's not grave. - How did she fall? - She didn't fall. The lamp fell on top of her. The one with the marble on the bottom. She played with the cable and it fell on top of her. - I put it on the shelf on my bed. - How thoughtful. You don't understand anything. I saw that it was going to split her head open and I didn't move. I saw it fall and I couldn't move. I wanted to hurt her, do you understand? - I wanted to hurt her. - You can't say that. What do you call that? What is it called? Please, Dominique. Tell Hayd?e. Tell her that I wanted to hurt Lola, that you know it! - Leave me in peace! - Explain it to her. Explain it well! Leave me in peace with Hayd?e. There's no reason for Lola to enter into this game. Lola is untouchable! Untouchable! "Untouchable. " Stop with the threats. Stop now. I'm not threatening you. Enough. I'm only saying for you to leave Lola alone. - Leave her out of this. - I'm telling you that I can't care for her, that it scares me to hurt her and you're threatening me. Let's go home. Let's go home. I don't want you to keep me from Lola. I'll make amends. I swear to you that I won't do it again. I never said I'll keep her from seeing you. I only want you to be good. If you are good, she will be good. "If I am good," what does that mean? You see now that I'm not. - If you're bad, you can call me. - Maybe I don't want to. If you're bad you can call me, but I'll worry about Lola. I'm not saying I'll keep you away from her. But rather that you're free to do as you like. Why would I want freedom? You think that she's the one who keeps me from being good? And if we have to see each other it won't be in hospitals. You don't want to believe that the lamp fell on top of her. - You don't want to believe it. - I haven't said that. You think I'm blackmailing you. A nice concept you have of me! Who said anything about blackmail? You did. There hasn't been any blackmail and there won't be any, either. There will never be any! It's not blackmail! - Calm down! - I don't want to hear that word anymore. Don't say that word anymore, I'm sick of it. - Calm down. - It's not blackmail! I'm not loved, not as I want to be. You said to have patience, that everything would improve. I know you want me. But it's not what I'm hoping for. I always go to the trailer, like an asshole. I'm not as intelligent as you'd like. You want to move. I say that, but it's normal. You want to live with other things. And exclude me. Never have I felt so low. I'm damaged goods, all I do is bleed. I also have colitis. Although that almost calms me down. You can take care of Lola, you do it better than me. Hayd?e also takes good care of her. I'm not counting on anything. What good would it do? I'm sick of caring for her. I'm tired. I've lost weight. Now I have a nice ass, but even that doesn't console me. Thanks for listening to me. It's the only thing I can do. I know you don't like to talk seriously. Will you be okay? What do you want me to tell you? I've spent the night crying, but yes, I'll be okay. Don't keep her waiting. It's enough that you make one person suffer. - It's not funny. - No, it's not. It's not. What a waste. Go. Go. Before you really hurt me. Feeling bad doesn't give you special rights, don't ask for her. Maybe I hate her, but I want to talk with her. What do you want to say? Knowing what you tell her about me, I'm sure you'll make me jealous. Do you think I'm like that? - I want to clarify certain things. - Everything is clear. You there and me here, talking bullshit. Have you seen how things have changed? - I'll call you. - She isn't there? Yes, but perhaps she doesn't want to talk. We'll call you in half an hour. Hey, I'm Hayd?e, where are we meeting? - At the caf? Du Pont. - At 3:00? I know what you look like. Until then. I'll be brief, I have to pick up my daughter. My neighbor takes care of her for me. Help me, I can't do it. Seeing you helps me understand things. Sorry for being so formal, give me a while. When he went before, it was only for a fuck. At the beginning it was very hard, and then I felt proud of myself seeing him gone at night. I told him: "Be careful, don't freeze your ass off. " And then I punished him. I waited a few days to see if he'd gotten an STD. As if those illnesses could be seen like that. I have no idea. I was sure it would happen. But I didn't think that it would affect me like this. I haven't come to tell you that but rather... in spite of whatever happens, I don't like being excluded like this. I'll show you a photo of my daughter. I don't have it here. Do you like children? Yes, but I never wanted to have any. Shall we leave? Forgive my crying, but this is how I spend the day. If I'd known you in another way, we'd have understood each other. But I'd prefer if you didn't exist. Right now. Wait... I have them here. It's evil that he doesn't want to be with her. It's monstrous! I can't. I want her and at the same time I can't. I've only come to see you and talk a little. I've already shown too much of myself. I feel ashamed. I can't live in this house anymore. I can't. I've suffered too much. I suffer too much. I'm going. I'm leaving Lola with you You can tell Hayd?e that she can come stay here. It's all the same to me. You can bring her and fuck her, it's all the same to me. It's all the same to me. It's all the same to me now. You don't exist anymore. And besides, she'll take better care of you than me. I don't know anything anymore. Lola's your daughter. When I look at her, I see you. I don't see myself in her. It's terrible, but that's how it is. I don't see myself in her. I need tenderness, I need you to want me. I'm waiting for the first guy who can give me that. Some guy a little like that. A simple guy. Who knows how to love me, nothing more. A little human. I want a guy who's a little human. - Did you want to see me? - I'm going, I'm leaving Lola with you. Hayd?e can live here and take care of her. I'm indifferent to you now. It's terrible for Lola but I can't see her anymore. Are you sure I'm not bothering you? Because I'm not a good companion right now. It's always good to see you. Even if you're feeling bad. I haven't come to talk about that. I'm here with the drawings. Does it bother you? You already asked me. Look... It has evolved, it's not the same. I'm sorry, I still want to caress you. Does it bother you? I want to show you the drawings, not my ass. Your opinion is important because I like what you draw. - I haven't touched your ass. - For me, it's the same. Sorry. It's more of a series of drawings than a comic. But it will suffice. Don't try to please me. Tell me the truth. You're asking me to judge your most personal work. You trust me but I scare you. I want you to see that I want you. Stop playing the fool. As soon as I arrive, you talk about sex. Let's talk about my drawings, and speak honestly. It's all I ask, it's not much. Hayd?e? It's Jacques. Surprise, Dominique has left me all alone. It scares me that she's gone without knowing where. Do you hear me? Yes. After seeing you she could have thought that our relationship was serious and... fled. What do you think? Nothing. It's pretty solid. What do you think? And you? Do you delight in your solitude? With my daughter I'm never alone. This is almost good for you. Girls like her who don't have much sex. And you, so calm in the middle of it all, with your daughter. You're alone, no? The problem is that sometimes women get so crazy. If she was around, you could tell. Since you'll take it badly, I'll tell you now. You've already said enough, go ahead. I believe you're a calm person and that you want Dominique. I never said anything to the contrary. You also want me, but you will never abandon her. Because you need her more than you think you do. And you'll never be able to bear her feeling so bad. I want to talk. Can I sit beside you? Yes. I'll warn you that I talk a lot. That's okay. - Do you want a drink? - No. - Do you want one? - No, I'll buy. What do you do? I'm unemployed. I draw. I paint on paper. And I have a daughter. I live alone with her. Sometimes I go downhill. You know, it's easy for us to take on both things. A job and a child. And life, too. I want to spend the night with you. Do you want to? Yeah, sure. We'll have to drink something first. What should we drink, beer? A beer. Please, a beer and a white wine! Afterwards, we'll fuck. - Do you know what time it is? - Two in the morning. - Jacques isn't here. - I'm not here to see him. Do you want to come in? Come in. Have you had dinner? I'm not hungry. How is Jacques doing? Good. Is that how he's doing? Don't ever do that again! You know that between him and me it's not just sex. And he's the one who fucks you! What right do you have to touch my ass? Have you come for that? Forgive me. I haven't come for that. It's not what I wanted. I only came looking for a little love. A little love, like this? You're hot, do you like it? Is this what you came looking for? Where do you want to go? Sit down. I want to fuck him, not you. A woman can excite me, but not now. I need so much love right now. And I'm such an asshole. Your reaction is normal. I'm scaring you. I'm sorry. You don't know where to sleep, sure. Where are you going to sleep, do you know? Lie down, stay there. I'll give you some dinner. Take the jacket off. Have you eaten something? I'll bring you something. I've come to make love with you. You're a very rare woman. Do you want to hear something? With everything that you've done, I still sympathize with you. Kiss me. Stay there. Undress, I'll go get a sandwich. - How are you? - Good. Dominique is with me. She's sleeping. Yeah, sure. You don't believe me? - Do you want to hear her? - Yes. Listen. Are you still in doubt? Have you been with another man? Asshole. You live with a woman for so many years and don't recognize her breath. Her snoring. Her snoring! You did right by leaving. Seriously, is she there? Yes, seriously. What did she come for? Looking for love. She came to the right place. Your woman is keeping me from talking to you. I'm letting you go. I don't want to wake her up by talking. She's sleeping like a baby. If I could sleep... A kiss. A kiss. I had a nightmare. We were in a ship, and you pointed to something in the sea. It was my body, and I jumped. I jumped and woke up. I don't have complicated dreams. Why are you still here? Are you hoping to go with Jacques? Are you punishing yourselves for hurting me? Are you waiting for everything to settle down, so the reunion will be better? It's not that. We don't hope for anything. Your going doesn't fix anything. - Why? - Leave it be, it's useless. I'm trying to understand it. - Mademoiselle Hayd?e. - Yes. A woman with the kind of life I want. - This is Mademoiselle Lola. - Yes. What do you say? Does she wet the bed? Are you going to pee? What do you say? No, she hasn't peed. Not at all. - Has Dominique been gone long? - Yes, she left early. Won't you come over here? No. She knows who you are. The woman responsible for your sex problems? What is sex? What is sex? I'd like to know. And how was Dominique? It didn't start well and it got better. Thanks for the ball... It's no worse now than it was before. Lola, let me talk with the woman. We like her, we caress her, understand? What do you want to do with her? Do you want her too? Will you tell me in the car? - What you were just saying. - Why? Are we going? Yes. You'll come live in the house. And Dominique? We'll wait for her together. - Was this your idea? - Yes. No, Lola came up with it, right? - No. - No, she didn't come up with it. It's what Dominique wants. You're charming. Did you hear what she said, are you charming? What? I wanted to tell you before. I'm a week late. Late... Are you used to this sort of thing? Two or three days, yes. A week, not so much. We can talk about the possibility. Even though I've shown great intellectual resistance, perhaps you've affected me. If it were true, having a baby with Hayd?e... - Do you like the idea, or no? - No. - I don't like it. - You don't like it. And what's going on with Dominique? She's in no position to care for another kid. You're an asshole. The more they're assholes, the more I want them. Did you hear that? The more they're assholes, the more I want them, the more they want me. Understand? She wants me for that. - Hello? - It's me. How is Lola? Very good. Pass the phone to her. I want to speak with her. Do you know what time it is? She's sleeping. I want to talk with her, pass the phone to her. I'm not going to wake her up to talk to you. Call tomorrow. Are you sure she's okay? She is, but if you think she's not, what's going on? I've only drank a little. And why? You never did before. Are you alone? No... some friends are coming now. - What friends? - My friends are going to arrive. Everyone. I'm waiting for them. If I wait for them, it's because they're going to arrive. If nobody's going to arrive, I think you're alone. No. I'm sure they're coming. Give me your number and let me talk to you if... I want to, alright? 750480. Alright. And don't hesitate to call me if you're not feeling well. Yes. Until later. I'm going to bed. I'll wait a little, I'm going to call her, she's not well. Thanks for calling me. It makes me happy that you wanted to call Lola. Rest assured, your daughter is fine. Should I organize an outing for you? Those are good for me, too. What time should I wake her up? You're very good to me. Can I go tomorrow? Sure, come. Do you want to wear some particular outfit? She's trying to sleep. Think of your daughter, it'll help you. Until tomorrow. You're out of luck, she's still sleeping. But you can come in. I'm still going to see her. My little girl is so pretty. Very pretty. I didn't wake her up. Do you want to have coffee? Yes. Hayd?e's coming soon. To eat. I'd like us all to eat together. What's new? Since I've left, I don't have colitis. That's good, it's a sign that your head is good. Soon I'll be able to say: "I knew Jacques well, he gave me the runs. " Last night, making love, I didn't have to think about Hayd?e and you. I could see how you do it. It's no fun to fuck like that. How do you think we fuck? - You're going to hurt her with this game. - You think I'm playing? It's not a game. If you're gonna talk bullshit, I'm not going to admire you. I have the right to try to live, no? If I drink and fuck, what business is that of yours? It helps me live. I would have to calculate whether it's worth the grief or not. For how long are you going to pursue me with your judgments? I don't judge you, you know that. But I see your bullshit the same way I see mine. Stop being presumptuous. It's my business. If it's like that, go ahead, scorn me. I don't scorn you. But you always trouble me with your tirades. I don't have tirades, I don't scorn and I don't judge. Alright? No. Will Hayd?e be back soon? In the snout! In the nose, did you see? Look how red my nose is. Will you give me a kiss? She's coming at noon. - Have you seen my nose? - Yes. On the nose! Attention... She's coming at noon, why? Can I come back tomorrow? You can come when you want, it's your house, your daughter, your ball. What do you want me to tell you? It's stupid to ask me that. I'd prefer that she wasn't. We'll tell her to find something to do. - Sorry. - It's not your fault. Come on, let's play some football. Is she here? She's gone. It started well, she was happy seeing Lola, all was going well and suddenly she asked if... you were going to arrive quickly and then... she fled. It's better than if you didn't arrive at all. At least she came to see Lola. Yes, but she's coming back tomorrow at 10:00. And she doesn't want you to be here. - Does everyone have to have their own time? - Sure. If you are, she won't come to see Lola. She's convinced that she has abandoned her daughter and if there's the smallest obstacle, and forgive me for calling it that, and she won't come. I'm not discussing it. The ideal would be Dominique on the weekend, until Sunday afternoon, so we could see a film. - That's good. - And then Hayd?e Tuesday morning, a little pleasure in the morning, you like that. And then, nothing! I sleep better alone in bed. - What I say turns you on, eh? - It amuses me. I'm trying to annoy you. - They're big, no? - Yes, breasts of a nurse. Perhaps Dominique will be a little disturbed. But we women are more prepared than you think. I never said anything to the contrary. The problem is that you're staying with Lola. You would have come with me if she had her. So I've been caught too. Don't go, come here. And what have I done now? You don't want to come inside now? I can't stay. It's Hayd?e. I saw her in the kitchen. But Lola's waiting for you in her room. I really only wanted the right to visits. She could never stay with me anymore. You don't work, you don't have a house, you don't like caring for her, without talking about your personal problems. We can talk about it but it's very bold on your part. And what are we going to say? For now you should come to see her more often, after that, we'll see. Hayd?e isn't her mother and she never will be. I'm scared this is hurting her. I can't avoid it. Clearly, Hayd?e is evil and hurts children. It's not true. She takes very good care of Lola. I want to say one thing about Hayd?e, now that you're leaving. Let's talk to her. Hayd?e, come here. I can't care for Lola, and I would want to sleep here. It's your house. I will sleep in the cabin, I will clean the house and be with my daughter. If you stay it's not in exchange for something. Neither to talk nor to clean. - You could have breakfast with us. - I'm here for Lola. It's not asking much of you. You believe that? I'm sick of so much contempt. You're not well? You think that Dominique has a monopoly on feeling bad? What's going on? Quieter, they'll hear us. We'll also have to moan in silence, it's not going to be fun hearing us. The noise might pass under the door. If we block it with the mattress and press our teeth, we can moan in silence. We can also sleep. That way, we won't make any noise. What do you want me to tell you? That you're right? - And that you're not very generous? - You don't have to say anything. I can tell you to press your teeth, because you still can't make a boy. What do you want to hear? Something to calm me down. Perhaps we could make love. That doesn't always work. Are we trying to make it work? Not tonight. You're not the maid. It's dirty, nobody is clean here. It's my turn. Are you cleaning much now? I want to talk with you. I have other things to do. Have you had breakfast? Does it matter to you? Yes. It's impossible to talk with you. Talking isn't communicating, it's submitting. I read that in a book. Do you want to talk? I want us to understand each other better. Ah, you can't stand it? I don't think so, I think you love these situations. I love them. And one has to tell you you're wanted. You're unconscious. That's as absurd as telling you that you enjoy the drama. Has Hayd?e blown you? Don't bring Hayd?e into this. It's hard to make peace with you. For you one must be peaceful. I want to tell you that it's possible Hayd?e is having a boy. That it's possible she's pregnant. "That it's possible. " You tell me little by little so I assume the best? No, because you have to give us a little... time. Do you want to tell me that I have to loosen up? No. I could tell you it'd make me happy to have... another son. But it would seem a little presumptuous. Did she not want you to tell me? I know it's not the case. You're always so critical. I don't want you to ignore the important things. I don't want her to have a son! She'd have to buy a test to know. She has to decide. Perhaps she prefers to go to the gynecologist. If it's a money issue, I'll buy it. It's not, you know that. Do you want to know? Yes. Are you coming to the store? No. No. I'm staying with Lola. What nonsense have you done now? I've told her that perhaps you were pregnant. And now she wants to give you a pregnancy test. Yes, I know. I'm not in a hurry to know. It's my business. Why does she want to know? To shoot me dead if I'm pregnant? You're right but you don't solve anything. Get some money, we'll get a test. So we'll see if I expect a baby from Jacques. It's no problem. Do you have money? Let's see, show me. I don't know how much it costs. Let's make the purchase together. I'm going to look for Jacques. Let's buy the test with Dominique. - You were effective. - Yes. Are we making peace? Out of the question.. Peace and $10. I'm not making a pact with a traitor. Peace and $20. $50 and say no more. Playing around will be expensive for you, you play too much. Good day. Hello, I'd like a pregnancy test. Do you need anything else? Here it is. 35, with your 20. And 50, thank you. Thank you, goodbye. Goodbye. Two hours have passed. Are you sure? I didn't want to know if I was pregnant. Before it was nice. Now it makes me sick. I'll be blunt, you must have a child. I don't believe you truly think that. Go away Lola, I don't want to play. I really wanted to have a boy and you didn't believe me. Now it's all the same to me. The only thing I regret is having a daughter. So don't expect me to cry for what you don't have. - Can you feed Lola? - No. No and no! I don't want Lola. Stay with her, I don't want her. Stay with her! What are you doing there, kid? Hayd?e doesn't want to play with me, she told me so. Let's see her, she'll play with you. I'm leaving Lola with you, I'm going to look for Dominique. Feed her and... Be back soon, eh, Lola? If it weren't for Lola, I'd kill myself. It's the only thing keeping me and I have the right. This is lasting long. And I'm putting in a lot of effort, even if it doesn't seem like it. Settle down, this morning was a little better... It would help me if you'd care a little about me. You're very good, I thank you. Would you give me your mouth? It's like if some nasty old vagina were only there to give birth. You haven't planned to get some liquor? She wouldn't be very thankful. Try keeping it to yourself, keep it for Hayd?e. Shall we go drink that liquor? You had to tell her about our baby. That's why he died. I liked him. It's better for us. You're not going to have children by being dexterous and sinister. My womb will never do to have children. What you want is her suffering. And now it scares you to rid yourself of it. I know what's going on with you. I, when I love, give all. You continuously protect yourself. Half here, half there. So living with you is suffering. I'm full of shit, I'm tired. Don't reproach me for it. No, it's the truth. Some time ago I would have known how to love you. I have the impression that my wings have been cut. Aging is not a virtue. It's not age, you never had wings. You don't know. I prefer to go on loving you. A part of me wants to stay and the other wants to go with you. The two are in conflict. And they twist inside. When you go, I'll be very in love with you. At the same time, your going will alleviate my pain. Take Jacques's car, I'll bring it tomorrow. Then I'll go. I'm fed up with being the third one in a couple. I know what's going to happen. - What do you want to say? - Hayd?e said she's going. Aren't you? I want you to keep calm for me. It's not worthwhile to punish you. There's nothing between us, go with her. It won't be like you predicted. I don't want to try to understand it anymore. I'm fed up with being the one who fucks everyone! It's my fault if Hayd?e goes, I've been unfaithful to everyone. It's like that or you go look for her or I'm going with Lola, choose. I want you to leave me in peace. I have to wait with dignity so that you can grieve. I don't have the right to so much delicacy. I'm sure you don't want to hurt her, but your good intentions won't last. Why is it my fault when everything fails? You want to be with me but you read. Nothing's left of what I wanted. - You're not exaggerating. - I'm not exaggerating. You always try to exaggerate. I assure you I'm not trying. Look at me. Touch me, caress me... I can't, Dominique. Please... Lie beside me. I can't. Look at me. Come fuck me. I could get off on anything. Come here. Come here! The keys. - Is he up? - Working in his office. If you want, I'll accompany you. It's no problem, I'll walk. Or I'll hitchhike. It's over, I don't want to speak. Yes, I'm taking you, I'm going to get the keys. I tried to hit her with the car. But I failed. I'm doing it all wrong. You can get the car, it's in the road. She has gone and that doesn't even make it better.. I'll get the car. - No, I'll go. - I'm going. I want us to have a talk. You think that talking will fix something? It won't be better than seeing someone... with whom you can talk? A therapist? An analysis while you rub your hands together? To cure my murderous instincts, as you would say. Don't make me say what I haven't said. It doesn't interest you to talk. What interests you is playing with me. And that you can fuck me. I'm going to work, so we can eat. What do I have to do? To bite my tongue so you don't hear me, is that what you want? You played with my bad conscience and I've renounced Hayd?e. Don't you see that because of you I've lost that love and it hurts me? You don't see it? If you want to adjust accounts, adjust yours first. I'm not the man you were hoping for, but I'm not a demon, either. Neither angel nor demon. Let me go with Lola. We'll go to Paris, to Isabel's house, we'll fix everything. Help me go, please. It hurts me to leave you. Do you remember how my parents reacted when we first met? They were happy. My annoyances, my whims, everything disappeared. Thank you. You were proud. You played the modest tamer. They never accepted how it was. I passed from submission to my parents, to submission to you. Certainly, I liked it when you made decisions. Perhaps you need that. That relationship of submission. Perhaps you also could have helped me. To be a little more free. Can a person give liberty to someone? I'm not quite ready for that. Don't hold me so tight...
