Fellow believers! In this fateful hour the fatherland calls upon its sons to come forth. We call upon you to exhaust all possibilities of serving your country. Of course every German Jew is willing to strive and fight with their goods and their persons. Call to arms by the Central Association for German Citizens of the Jewish Faith, August 1st 1914. Dear listeners all across the Reich, it is 9 o'clock. We interrupt this program for a short report about the formation of the new government in the Reich's Capital. It seems likely that, after tough negotiations, the formation of a government coalition was successful. The President has set the announcement of the new Chancellor at 11 A.M. We have yet to receive final confirmation. According to well-informed sources, a government led by Franz Von Papen is to be expected. Exact details regarding the composition of the Cabinet are not yet known. The prominent participation of the NSDAP as the largest faction is deemed to be ensured. Exact details about Minister positions... Here you go, Herr Liebermann. Black with sugar. Thank you. Excuse me... Would you be so kind and turn this off? Of course. I can't listen to this anymore. It was said downstairs that Herr Liebermann was eating in the Radio Room. Aaron, my DOV! Coffee as usual? - Yes. I've finished already. One more coffee and then it's back to work Have a seat. We haven't seen you in the club for a while. How's the old man? Quite well. He was a bit saddened that you couldn't attend the party. He was overjoyed with the painting. By the way, some family members are convening to eat what's left from the weekend. Maybe you'd like to come. No, that's alright. Actually... When I think of the momentary political situation, I can't eat as much as I'd like to vomit. What if I told you that we even got the good cognac out of the cellar? It was my grandfather's. There aren't many bottles left. Aaron, you tempt me. Your grandfather's cognac... Your grandfather... I snuck him into the Kontor once. To steal some pens. I paid for that one dearly. Well, he was a tough man. Even so, I would have preferred him as father to my own. Father always said, Grandfather viewed you as a son. Even more so, after Uncle Josua passed. So how's Käthe? Quite well. Our son-in-law is a Professor of Philosophy in Frankfurt now. He's the head of the board of trustees. They haven't got it bad. I always thought Riezler would have had political ambitions. No. They always blamed Kurt for the war. Him and Bethmann Hollweg. That always followed him. Now they have constantly a changing government instead. I wonder if they'll come to an agreement today. I'm afraid so. What do you think Kurt thinks of all this? To him, all of them are a bunch of fools. I'm not so sure, opinions are split in this club. Is that so? That's why I haven't been here for a while. I don't really care about those windbags downstairs, but... What do you think about the rabble-rouser? Do you think he's good? For the love of God, no. But I think there are enough people that do. I'm still hoping that the President simply doesn't appoint a new Chancellor. That would be something. But he will. I know. And I always thought highly of him... Good ol' Hindenburg. Remember how I painted his portrait? Some paper wrote how disgraceful it was that it was done by a Jew. Laughable. I'm still convinced Hindenburg found it laughable as well. I'm just a painter. What does that have to do with Judaism? Mettenschmidt showed me postcards a short while ago. Hitler painted them in Vienna. Awful. Your portrait of father is magnificent, however. He was overjoyed by it. Don't mention it. I always wanted to paint him. You could hang it in the apartment. So you don't forget who the actual Herr Glickstein is. Well, we'd better get going. Otherwise you'll be late at the office. Do I have everything? Thank you. - Let me help you. Thank you, my boy. Herr Liebermann, why don't you come by tonight. Father will be disappointed anyhow when he hears we met here and he wasn't there. I hope so. I'll tell you what, I'll call you later and then we'll see. Say hello to the family. I've got to go. A message from the office. My coat, please. Of course, Aaron. Sally Rehfeld is dead. Requesting immediate instructions. THE LAST SUPPER Hitler is Chancellor! Son! Are you coming? Do you need any help, mom? No, thank you my dear. You can go inside. I have decided, mom. I know. I understand, but you have to understand us too. We are your parents and we are worried. Dad doesn't have a clue. That's not true. Did you tell him? Not yet. I just wanted... It has to be discussed carefully with your father. But it can't wait any longer. I will talk to him tomorrow, but be patient. Patience? - Yes. If we keep waiting he will wake up in a month and nothing will be as it was. Then all will be lost. Leah! Imagine being able to leave all this behind. Poverty is everywhere. But we could go to California, or New York. Yes, I'd certainly be the only Jewish doctor there. They must be desperately waiting for me. They may be waiting for me, my darling. This is a huge opportunity. If Lemmle Jr. buys my novels, then - - If he buys them. Fortune favors the brave, Daniel. The thought of leaving my home and everything my parents built... All that's uncertain enough as it is. What about your position in the Ministry? Don't start with that now. My parents would be stunned in disbelief. "Boy, what about your position at the Charité hospital?" "Seems to be too difficult for this doctor!" We'll take one! Look over there, it's your sister. Hello Sarah! Any news from Hollywood? We were just talking about it. There isn't any real news yet. Clocks run at snail's pace over there. It's taking ages. But if it works out? Then we'll most likely move to the States. Look at you, brother! I wouldn't have thought you could overcome your patriarchal shadow. Fortune favors the brave. I have my fingers crossed. Who knows, as we may have to emigrate soon it can only benefit us if family is there. I always thought the dream was Moscow. Dreams don't live very long these days. We don't have to discuss this in front of our parents today, do we? Let's go upstairs. My sister-in-law will be serving food with Prussian punctuality. And I'm hungry! APPETIZERS: Chicken broth with root vegetables Should we wait? Let's just start. He'll come when he's ready. Benjamin, would you be so kind and "benschn" for us? Grandfather Jakob, we pray after the meal. The blessing, my boy, the blessing! You know what I mean! Thank you, Rabbi. Thanks. Smells good! Wait. Dad! I'm sorry, I couldn't come any sooner. A lot going on today, huh? Sally Rehfeld died last night. A friend, Aaron? One of our most important business partners. And the contract? I spent all day trying to find out. But no luck. What now? - We'll see. It's understandable that the Rehfelds had other things on their minds today. Thank you. Don't worry. Tomorrow morning I'll finish up the contract with his replacement. Do you have an appointment? Yes. I just wanted to explain why I was late today. And now, let's eat. Bubbale, you don't need to apologize for doing your job. Well then, I hope you all enjoy. Thank you. Enjoy. So it was an important assignment? It would be unfortunate if it were to fall through. How unfortunate? What? Is the question not justified? As justified as inquiring about malpractice, Doctor. It's alright, Papa. Daniel's right. We would have quite a mess if we don't get the contract. To think that Sally wanted to sign today... He will no longer be able to do so. What does that mean? Are we broke? No, darling. The Prussians don't shoot quite that quickly. We have quite a few outstanding debts though. It could get tight. Tell them you had a verbal contract! Don't let them shake you off. As I said: we have an appointment tomorrow. Don't you all forget to eat with all this talk now. Right. Enough about business. Thank you. Rebecca, this is excellent. It really is. Most of it is from the party. It was good then, too. Charmer. No, the doctor is quite right. Let us now have a toast to my wonderful daughter-in-law, who organized such a wonderful 80th birthday for me. To Rebecca! - To my darling. Today it seems to have been a wild day. It looks like David will have to work overtime in the Ullstein house. Did something special happen? Didn't you hear anything, Aaron? - No, why? They captured the BVG (public transit company) robbers! Thank God. One can hardly be sure of his life in Berlin. And Hitler is Chancellor. Great. That's just what we needed. That awful person! - Terrible. People seem to have gone mad. All this with Hitler... it's not a real surprise anymore, is it? It was to be expected of Von Papen to use the Nazis to gain the majority. I wouldn't have expected the Field Marshal General to involve himself with that agitator. The old one perhaps. But he belonged to Von Papen. Monarchists, fascists, even the Social Democrats - they're all part of the same oppressive force. Sarah, now is not the time. - When is it ever? It never is for you socialists. You will not speak to your aunt in that tone. You're the one who keeps saying how dangerous Communism is. The Nazis are no better, Michael. Is that so? The NSDAP is the only party that freely addresses what is wrong in Germany. You and your Nazi friends? They're anti-Semites! If it were up to them, they'd expel us from the country. Or worse! We shouldn't be too alarmist about this. They are making a lot of noise, especially Hitler. He knows what he has to say to rally those who have been disappointed behind him. In the end things won't be as bad as they seem. Oh no? - Have you forgotten the attempted coup? The street battles with the SA? - Yummy! They're thugs and murderers. - And your Red Front? They're all pacifists? This is a fight for the survival of our nation. That will involve some bloodshed. Don't be flippant about bloodshed. The Lord tells us to be peaceful. The same Lord that sent his angel to kill the firstborn of the Egyptians? Boy, that's enough. But father, you of all people should understand. You fought for our fatherland. You laid in the trenches, you have the iron cross! Like Hitler! We defended Germany from our enemies and they came from France, England and Russia. Hitler seems to look for his enemies in his own country. Well, Michael isn't completely wrong. People in the foreign ministry are saying that Hitler's stance on the Treaty of Versailles and the territories lost is long overdue. He isn't afraid to send clear messages to London and Paris. Mind you my Jakob and I sent four sons to war. The good Lord sent us back two. Two... Two remained in the field. They fell for the fatherland. But my dear Monika, they died for a different Germany. It was not the Germany envisioned by this Austrian. That's not how Monika meant it, Papa. But grandfather is right. This isn't the same Germany that father went to war for. Is it, Papa? As far as that goes, I don't know if the Germany I went to war for ever existed. The Kaiser ultimately gave us full equality. Don't forget that. And while Hitler became Chancellor today, the Kaiser sat around somewhere in Holland and chopped firewood. Must be quite difficult with only one arm. That's true. Some say that Hitler will bring the Kaiser back. Nonsense. - As long as the old man is President, one of the Kaiser's trustees will remain in a key position. Hindenburg is six years older than me, how long will that last? As if the Kaiser, the Stahlhelm or Hindenburg were a good thing. With men like that in power we will hardly have a future in Germany. She's right about that. What do you mean by that, dear? I... I mean that I won't stay in Germany. Beg your pardon? I'm going to Palestine with Hannah and Samuel. Leah, couldn't you have waited with that? You knew about this? Rebecca? It's my fault, Aaron. Leah asked me, and I - - Did you know about this? YES. Hannah and Samuel are leaving next month. Aaron, don't get upset. It's wonderful if Leah wants to see the land of our fathers. Eretz Israel! - Mother! Father. My 19-year-old daughter wants to emigrate to Palestine with her cousin and no one deems it necessary to talk to me about this? You're right. That's not the Germany for which I laid in the trenches. In my Germany we respected our father. Don't flatter yourself, boy. As if you always respected me. Besides, I also knew about Leah's wish to do this. I told Rebecca not to discuss it with you yet. Why would you do that? Let's not discuss this in front of the entire mischpocheh. What with all the pressure in our business and so on... Rebecca, let's get the rest. No, let me do that. How can you keep something like that from me? I'm sorry. - You're sorry. We wanted to talk to you about it. Later. How much later? When I've received a postcard from Palestine? 'With love, Leah'? It's not as if you were especially open to such conversations. No, I'm not. Because they're absurd. But Why? Because Leah isn't even 19. And because I'll be damned before I send her to the Mussulmen with a suitcase! She wants to build a life there. One suitcase will hardly be enough. Do you think this is funny? You embarrassed me. You and your daughter. Our daughter. In front of the whole family. "Aaron doesn't even know what goes on in his own home", they'll say. That's what you're worried about? That your reputation may be tarnished? I'm worried that our daughter wants to throw her life away. I won't allow that. Have you got the slightest idea what it's like in Palestine? What sacrifices and dangers await her there? Bigger ones than here? - Yes, of course. What are you even talking about? Aaron, Leah has been threatened by Brownshirts twice. The second time ended in a fight. When? - Last Thursday. Samuel Herlitz and that Silberstein boy helped her. Why didn't you tell me? Because you weren't there, as usual. There were those talks with the French from Marseilles and you didn't have time. I always have time when it comes to protecting my family, you know that. Sure. You would have forbidden her to leave the house after 6 o'clock. Well, it isn't becoming to do so. Why are you acting up? This isn't like you. Maybe that was always the mistake I made. I was too soft. Too lenient, too generous. With Michael, yes. But never with Leah. Michael is a boy, he needs to give things a try. Leah is a young woman. Her greatest asset is her reputation. That needs to be preserved. I hardly think it's her reputation we need to worry about. The uncertainty of whether she can be anywhere at any time in Berlin safely - that should worry us. You're exaggerating. - Weren't you listening? The boys fought last Thursday to protect her! And why don't you discuss that with me? She had already been thinking about leaving then for a long time. She was worried, and scared about what you would say. That's why she didn't want to tell you anything yet. What now? Leah is determined to emigrate to Israel with Samuel and Hannah. To the land of our fathers. - That is out of the question. Germany is my father's country, and his father's. This silly notion of a Jewish state... How can you just say something like that? Because I won't let our daughter just go somewhere in the Ottoman Empire to let her be forced into slavery by Berbers! So she should let herself be beat up by Nazis here instead. Here we still have law and order! This is Prussia, not Arabia. I don't give a damn about Hitler and his cohorts. The scare will pass. But who will protect Leah from some dagger in the East? The Zionist police? The Brits. - Hah! The Tommies. Even better. - It's safe there. And you know it. Do you think Benjamin would have let his spoiled daughter move there if he hadn't gotten information on everything? You want to use the rabbi of all people to vouch for the safety of our daughter? Benjamin is a great and intelligent man. But that doesn't seem to count with you. He knows the Torah. He knows nothing about the real world. Heaven forbid that anyone but Aaron Glickstein may know something about the world. Don't be silly. - You be open for what others have to say. I am open. - Yes. But not for your family or me. Don't worry, I won't make a scene. But it's you who knows nothing about the world out there, Aaron. Things are changing. At any rate, Leah will not be going to Palestine. We shouldn't talk about this anymore. - It's my final word. Yes. But not mine. We have guests. Let's talk about this later. Monika doesn't smoke anymore, does she? - No. It's better that way. Aaron is very stubborn. Well, Leah is a bit young, isn't she? Palestine... We'll all have to think about it sooner or later. About Palestine? - Emigrating. You are thinking about it. Monika sees a brighter future overseas. I want her to be happy. That's great. I really hope it all works out. You think so? You don't really want to go. What can I do? I love my country. After everything that happened? The war? The Republic? What about it? - Don't play dumb, you know what I mean. Sarah, had you seen what I saw at Verdun... All the comrades that gave their lives for their country... And your letters? You suffered like animals! We would've never made it without our love for the fatherland. That's exactly what I mean. Fine. I wasn't there. But I still know what was done to the soldiers. On all sides. Always in the name of their country. What was the thanks for that? - Those were your people. Socialists and Bolshevists. - Communists. - Fine. That was you. Your revolution. Wasn't it? You don't seriously believe in the stab-in-the-back myth? Unbeaten in the field, betrayed at home. All that? No, not like that. But we gave everything. Maybe... Maybe we should still. No! On the contrary. You should have stopped far sooner. The revolution came too late. Oh, sister... I don't want to fight with you. What I want to say is: Aaron and I and all our comrades can't help it. We're German patriots - till death. That's what I'm afraid of. We came down here to smoke. - Ah, it's you. So Rebecca and you can have your space. - Thank you. Would you like a cigarette? - No, thank you. I'm just going to go get some beers at the supermarket. I need a short walk. Would you like to hear my opinion? Sure. The Zionists are just as alien to me as to you. But you should let Leah go. It's important to accept her decision. So she sees that her father views her as an emancipated, independent woman. I'll think about it. I've got to go. The supermarket closes at seven. You can't get rid of facts by ignoring them. Rosa Luxemburg. - No. Aldous Huxley. Who? Ask Monika. She may know of him. Should we go back up? - Sure. I'm hungry again. I know it's not so easy, Rebecca. What do you mean? - Life with Aaron. Am I wrong? We've got it good together. You know I love my sons. But I know them too. That's how I think - no, that's how I know it's not easy with Aaron. In that case, I don't think it's easy with any man. Jakob and I had a good life. But don't assume that means he always behaved accordingly. A lot of that behavior had better remain secret. Still: he was a good husband. Aaron is too. But it's been taxing lately with work and the children. It's a daily battle. That it is. Men live their lives as battles. War is just one aspect. Work is another. Day by day- Temptation is a big part as well. It's up to us women to stand behind our husbands. And to lead them if necessary. If only Aaron let himself be led... Well, I'm still here. I thought about separation once. YES. I'm very thankful that you are such a wonderful wife to my son. I love him. And he loves you. I know. And that's why you'll get through this together. Battles like these are challenges that strengthen a marriage. Let's see what happens when we continue discussing Leah. I'm sure you will find the right way. Radio stock company Siegmund Loewe, office of Siegmund Loewe, Miss Schneider speaking, how can I help you? Hello Karen, it's Aaron. Could I speak to Siegmund? What is this concerning? I need to discuss business matters with him urgently. You only call when you need help, don't you? Do you need anything else? Karen, I have no time to argue right now. I apologized to you, and - - I'm not some hussy, you know. Please connect me to Siegmund. We can meet next week and discuss this properly. I bet you'd like that. Anyhow, Dr. Loewe isn't in the office anymore. He may still be in Herr Von Ardenne's shop. I'll try to patch you through. Thank you. Loewe? Siegmund. Thank God. It's Aaron Glickstein. Aaron. How are you? Things could be better. You're telling me. My brother David even wants to emigrate. What? Why? - You have noticed that we have a new government? But to leave to America? They've been wanting the discharging of Jews for years. They're calling it Aryanization. You'd better be prepared. If you say so. - Albert has already been there a few years. He wants to give up his German citizenship and leave the academy. We can talk about all this in the club someday. I'm calling you from a phone booth. Is your phone broken? No. I need your help. Okay, what is this about? Simply said, I'm in deep trouble. I'm sorry. There have been some unfortunate developments recently and today a very important business partner died. Sally Rehfeld? - Yes. Did you know him? In passing. Manfred went out with one of his daughters once. He told me about it this morning. Oh. I'll tell you what. Come by to Steglitz one of these days. Manfred can show you some great new things. We can transmit films to television tubes via antennas and show them. This is the future! Siegmund, I need a private loan. As soon as possible. Is it that bad? I had no idea. Nobody can know. Even Rebecca. I desperately need liquidity in the company or... we lose everything. Alright, Aaron. I'm not sure what will be possible and I won't make any false promises. Just come by my office at 10. My accountant will be there. We'll find a solution. Thank you, Siegmund. Say hello to the family. YOU TDD. Good evening, Herr Glickstein. Good evening... Ottilie Cohen. Fourth floor. No! You've grown. I haven't seen you in ages. That may be because you're never home. That's what Leah says. There may be some truth to that. Well then, have a nice evening and say hello to your wife for me. Thank you. I will. Maybe I'll see you around. MAIN COURSE: Braised beef with juniper berry sauce Everything alright, my boy? We were talking about the BVG robbers. I'm surprised you didn't know about that. Your payroll department was robbed too, wasn't it? Not our department. The bank where we manage our payroll accounts was. And you weren't informed right away? There was a lot going on. Many people calling in sick today. There's a bug going around. - Right, they closed down some schools because of that. I didn't know that. Yours too, Michael? Unfortunately not. Was any money seized? - Where? With the BVG robbers. - Not that I know of. But it was a pretty large operation. 130 officers. Thank God there was no bloodshed. Hoheisel and Achtenhagen are their names. What will be their sentence, Uncle Daniel? The noose, I'm sure. Sure. They'll hang the wild ones for shooting a municipal inspector. But mass murderers like Hindenburg that led entire armies to die get to be presidents. Sarah, it is unbecoming for you to speak of the President that way. Wouldn't that be an idea for one of your novels, Moni? The BVG robbers? I actually thought about it. It would have to be enhanced a bit though. Daniel could advise you on the medical aspects. My darling has never been keen on advice, have you, Moni? Who likes to listen to their husband? Is everyone enjoying their meal? It really is fantastic, Becky. Thank you. - And everything is kosher, right? Of course. A rabbi goes to the butcher and says: "I would like that fish. " And the butcher says: "That's not a fish, that's ham. " "I don't even want to know what that fish is called. " I got another one. A catholic priest, an evangelical pastor and a rabbi talk about their communities and discuss offerings. The priest: "I always take one tenth of the offering for the expenses of the church and the rest is for the welfare bag. If anything falls out, I take it for myself. " The pastor: "I do it similarly. One tenth for the Church, eight tenths welfare, one tenth for me. " The rabbi says: "You Christians are such hypocrites. That money is for God! That's why I do it differently. I throw it all in the air and say: Lord, take as much as you want. ''? How else could you finance a trip to Palestine as a rabbi? Good thing it's all a joke then. The land of Israel is no joke, father. Our people are sacrificing their lives for it. And you're sitting here joking about it! Sit down. We'll talk to your father about this later. Can we please talk about something else now? Then let's discuss this horrible new Chancellor. I can't stand the man. How can such a loudmouth become Chancellor? Max called earlier. He said he can't eat as much as he'd like to vomit. I think we're taking this Nazi scare far too seriously. The real power lies with Von Papen and Hugenberg. And Hindenburg. - And Hindenburg. I'm not sure if you aren't miscalculating the situation. This Hitler is a devious fellow. It has a lot to do with the American embassy. Most of them saw it coming but nobody expects them to be good leaders. It's just a phase, like the other governments that came and went. But someday Germany must become stable again. We'll look like fools if it happens with Hitler. I don't think the Nazis will dictate policy. Von Papen and Hugenberg will turn all this into real-world politics. They're experienced politicians. Conservative, but not Nazis. They needed a majority. The momentum behind Hitler could have a positive effect. I can't make out anything positive about this 'momentum'. Only cruelty, baseness and violence. I think Uncle Daniel is correct. The NSDAP and Hitler don't filter their words. They say what people are already thinking. The treaty must go and society and the economy need to be built from the ground up. We all agree about the Treaty of Versailles. Even without Hitler it's a waste of paper. Stresemann has already worked out the situation. Yes, and Hitler will have everyone believe it was him who did it. The Treaty of Versailles is still in effect. Hitler will change that. Only if the victors will allow it. And? And what? - Will they? I don't have direct contact to the diplomatic corps, but I believe so. And that is Hitler's doing because he doesn't mince words and tells them: not like this. Nobody said that there are no subjects on which one can agree with the NSDAP. Speak for yourself, brother. To me they're a bunch of criminals. But the DNVP and the Center aren't much better. How did I manage to have a daughter that has turned into a Bolshevist? Don't put blame on yourself, dad. It wasn't you. I just learned from our history. My brother should be wondering how he got a little Nazi as a son. Sarah! - How dare you! Telling things as they are still remains the most revolutionary. She's right. I openly support Hitler. - That's enough now. I hope we'll be done here soon. I want to join the torchlight procession. Torchlight procession? The Nazis announced a victory march from the Brandenburg Gate. With torches of course. How else. They will be coming here, too. - And I will join them. You will not. No family member of mine will march with those thugs and a fool like Hitler. We'll see about that. Michael, what are you saying? It would seem everything comes to light today. In my office. - Why? Because I want to have a serious talk with you. I'm not a child anymore, Papa. - Then don't act like one. Please excuse us. I'm sure you know what you're doing. Just make sure that you don't lose two children in one day. And they are both children. To family! The biggest battlefield on which a man can prove himself worthy. True. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't give you a beating and put you under house arrest until you finish school. I'm sorry. For what? - My tone. That wasn't right. That's something, at least. I ask for your forgiveness. Duly noted. What else? What do you mean? The nonsense you were spouting out there. I meant every word of it. You can't be serious. You're talking about a party that blames us Jews for everything that went wrong in this country. Not everything. - Not everything? Do you even know how many Jews there are in Germany? Two out of one hundred at most. And you think those two percent are responsible for our misery? If those are the two percent Finance and Economy Jews, why not? The Rothschilds and Guggenheims caused the financial crisis, not the M?llers and Lehmanns. - The "Finance Jews''?? Were you brainwashed? The Rothschilds and the Guggenheims? What about the Glicksteins? What about us? Are we part of your "Finance Judaism"? I didn't say that every merchant and businessman share the same responsibility in the subjugation of the German people! Where did you get all this from? Is that what you learn in school? Partially at least. Herr Grothe, our history teacher, talks to us about "Mein Kampf" and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Did he? - He did. At least he gives us lessons that are useful. Herr Pieper only taught us about Perikles or Karl the Great. Who cares about that? What does Herr Grothe think about Hitler? Nothing. He hasn't indoctrinated us if that's what you mean. We worked through everything that's wrong with the Republic. Then we compared what Hitler had to say about it. And you concluded that the Jews were to blame. You don't take me seriously. I hate that! How could I possibly when you believe such nonsense and repeat it at my dining room table? Mein Kampf and The Elders of Zion. What rubbish! - Have you read them? I have better things to do than read the garbage that some insane person wrote. I didn't read Mein Kampf. I don't have to. I know it only contains filth. You would know. - I do. I've heard your Hitler speak. That left nothing to the imagination. I heard his thugs roar in agreement. I know people like them. I've known them all my life. Fine. Some of it is a bit much, I'll admit. But if you don't read his book or The Elders of Zion then you don't know what's happening in Germany - in the whole world! The Protocols are evidence. The Jews are the perpetrators of a global conspiracy. Nonsense! Who knows who came up with that drivel. Probably the French or the Russians. You just don't want to accept it. Because you don't like it. But I'll tell you something: We have to be wary of these machinations. Machinations? These are your people you're talking about. You're talking about us. About you and me. I'm a German first. A Jew second. You've always said you don't like the Zionists either. Because they follow the wrong ideals, but the one thing hasn't got anything to do with the other. - Yes it has! Temple of Salomon! Fine. For argument's sake let's assume you are first a German, then a Jew. How do you decide when you're one or the other? How do you differentiate between them? Papa, what... - Don't "Papa''? me. Not now. You want to be a man? Face things like a man. - What do you mean by that? I mean that you're dodging my question. You're afraid to tell me what you really think. You don't want to admit you don't want to be a Jew. You want to be a real German. But let me tell you: there is no difference. Oh no? Are you meshugge? - Watch your tone. You can't stand that I have my own opinion. Everything that goes on in this family has to go your way. I can understand that Leah wants out. This is getting better and better. Do you really think Leah wants to go to Palestine just because of Hitler? She wants to study and you're standing in her way. That's why she wants to leave. Palestine is her only chance. As if I ever forbade you or your sister to fulfill your aspirations. She isn't fleeing from Germany. She's fleeing from you. You dare to insult me like this in my own home? Look in my eyes and tell me you don't already know it. I don't need to justify myself in front of you. You want me to act like a man? Fine. That's what I'm doing. I'm willing to hold myself accountable to my actions. Not just in front of you, but in front of our entire nation. Not the Jewish nation. The German nation. What are you saying? "Jewish or German". That's like "Frisian or German''?, or "Bavarian or German''?. I believe in the nationalist movement. And that Germany can rise to the place of power it deserves with Hitler. That benefits all of us. The fatherland won't be able to do without anyone, especially us Jews. We have to work even harder to prove ourselves, ere we get mistaken for Zionists and conspirators. They just use Judaism to hide. They are terrorists and traitors to the fatherland. Of course! Traitors to the fatherland. Thanks for explaining that to me, Mr. Hitler. But I thought you wanted to get rid of the Jews. So what's wrong with Palestine? Not that I have much love for it. But if the Jews are Germany's misfortune, why not let them go to Palestine? I didn't say it like that. You didn't? Your Hitler did though. If a Jew lives on the land, he will poison the wells. If he leaves, he betrays the fatherland. That is the global Jewish conspiracy. You twist everything. I just mean that you can't evade responsibility towards the nation, especially nowadays. This could be the beginning of something huge. Or its end. - Every beginning means ending what came before it. It has to be that way and that's perfectly fine. The world is changing, Papa. You're not the first one to tell me that today. Then maybe you should listen. And join in. From this day forward national socialism will be unstoppable in Germany. How is this supposed to go on? Do I have to expect you to be standing here in a brown shirt when I come home from work? Why not? Because then I will throw you out, you schmuck. Then you'll see if your Nazi friends will have any food to spare for you. You know what? You don't need to throw me out. I'm leaving. If you go through this door you don't need to come back. Fine. Then that's how it'll be. Wait! What are you doing? - Leave me alone. You cannot just leave. - Well, I am. Where? - To the torchlight procession. And then? Don't know yet. But you're coming back. If father gets his way, then no. Did he say that? - Yes he did. That and more. You know him. He'll get over it. Mama will smooth it out. Like always. I don't want her to. I'm no Mama's boy anymore. It's time for me to handle my own business. How? Where will you stay? Comrades. But... When will you come back? Never. He doesn't want me here. What about our mother? And me? You're leaving too. What about our mother then? Or with me? Then come with me! - To Palestine? No way. - It will be a completely new beginning! That's what we've got here, too! Michael. The Nazis don't want us. They hate us. Palestine needs us. Us? Maybe you, the Zionists. It's different with me. Oh yeah? Why is that? Those are my comrades. We have a common goal. Which is? A strong Germany. The life that we deserve. And what about us Jews? Humiliation and violence? Is that what your sister deserves? We want a safe country as well. A country of our own. To each his own. Michael, this isn't you. No, I'm not. Maybe because I'm not allowed to be who I could be here. It's different out there. Please don't go. Don't go. DESSERT: Red fruit jelly with vanilla sauce I'm going to get some fresh air. You do that, honey. I'll join you, Aaron. I'll get you a coat. Our street's full already. One day, we'll be able to say we were there. And Michael is one of them. Michael is a young man. He wants to rebel. But he comes from a good family. He is loved, he's welcome. He'll remember that. Then he'll come back, you'll see. And Leah? Will she come back from Palestine? That's different. But if you'd like... - I've had enough for today. It was a really terrible day. Let's talk about this some other time. When? I don't know, maybe in a few years. I know. I don't have that much time. Grandfather Jakob's birthday was probably the last time the family will be able to get together for quite some time. Hannah and Samuel are leaving in two weeks. Leah is going with them. I even tried to talk her out of it. Believe me. Benjamin, the only person I have to blame is myself. I didn't see all this coming. Rabbi! Is that kosher? A student of the Talmud asks his rabbi: is it allowed to smoke while you pray? Oh, no!, says the shocked rabbi. A friend hears this and says: you've got it all wrong. I'll show you how it's done. Two weeks later he winks at his friend and goes to the rabbi and asks him: am I allowed to pray while smoking? The rabbi is delighted and answers: Oh yes! Have you ever read Mein Kampf? - Heaven forbid, no. It seems to be the least read bestseller of all time. If no one reads it, it can't do any harm. I have read it. If they do what it says in there then God help us. In the end it's just a book. So is the Talmud. - Rabbi! You know what I mean. Don't underestimate this, Aaron. We're still in Germany. We have a rich culture, a grand history. It's not history I'm worried about. It's the future. Michael has a poster of Metropolis in his attic. I saw it back then. With him. Imagine that future. But multiplied by a hundred. Then you probably still fall short of what Germany has in store for itself. That's pure fiction. Metropolis is a film. I refuse to believe that everything will collapse because we have a new Chancellor. It says in the book that he wants to breed an Aryan master race and enslave or get rid of all the others. Forge a greater living environment in the East in a great war. This is the place of origin of reason and rationality. Goethe, Kant, Schiller! What you're saying sounds like everyone was on drugs. The two drugs of a German are beer and Wagner. I believe it was Nietzsche who said that. In any case, the Nazis seem to be consuming enough of both. You've got that right. But let's forget Wagner for a second. We have two cold beers waiting for us. One hundred percent kosher. Here they come. Let's go inside. I'm getting cold. Aaron... Please! Raise your flags! Final station. Please leave the train. THE LAST SUPPER About 100,000 German Jews fought with conviction in World War I for their country. Tens of thousands paid with their lives. Many of the survivors died 25 years later in extermination camps. Many German Jews like the Glicksteins made up a significant part of German society. Among them were many influential figures in German art, culture and science. Siegmund Loewe, the inventor of television, was forced to give up his business to "Aryans''?. Nearly all Jewish-German companies were "aryanized" between 1933 and 1939. Max Liebermann, one of the most influential painters of his time, was forced to abstain from his public post, as did many other Jews. He died in 1935, bitter and shunned. His wife Martha took her life before her impending deportation from Berlin. Around 100,000 of the 160,000 Jews in Berlin saved themselves into exile. 50,000 Jews fell victim to the Holocaust. About 9,000 survived World War II in hiding or in "mixed marriages" with non-Jews. Since 2005 the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin commemorates the 6 million Jews that died to Nazi tyranny. In 2017 more than 12,000 German Jews live in Berlin. Once again it is the heart of Jewish life in Germany. Around 20,000 Israelis live in Berlin, most of whom are young. Wanting to forget prolongs exile; the secret to salvation is to remember!
