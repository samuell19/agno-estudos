I get about four or five different chicks a week. Never the same one twice. Love 'em and leave 'em, that's my motto. Not interested in marriage, I suppose, huh Albert? I've been married. Three times, thank you. No divorces. I've got about three or four kids around this country. Pay any child support? Hell no. Are you kidding? I don't want any responsibilities. What would I pay child support for? You think you're a real He-Man, don't you, Albert? A real man show. (laughing) You better believe it. Ain't gonna let no little woman get the best of you, are you?

God is love, not sex. Love is for everyone. Women, children, animals. Sex is only for people who wish to have families. Oh yes, men are using our bodies, in the face of Lord God almighty. How can they do that to us, I ask you? For pleasurable sex. I am against pleasurable sex in any form. Oh sister, would you care to make a contribution to the cause? Bless you sister, bless you. Come and heed my word. I had a vision. My name is Sara Jane Butler, and I would stand by the good Lord himself to rid this world of pleasurable sex. Listen while the time is nigh, brother. Don't wait until it's too late. (upbeat bluegrass music) The new love generation, huh? If you two would spend a little more time reading the good book and less time on sex, why, you might even grow up to amount to something. Love generation. Sex generation, that's what it is. Huh.

You mean to say you charge a women of word for her daily bread? Lady, for the last time, it's 53 cents. If you want a handout, the Salvation Army's three blocks down. Thank you. Hey. Hey. Hey you, lady. It's me. Hi there. I'm the anti-sex lady from the street, remember? You gave me 10 dollars. Mind if I join you? No, of course not. My damn, pardon me, my car stalled. What's wrong with your car? I guess it's just plain wore out. That sure is a nice car you've got there. Must have cost a bundle. Not so much. Oh, you're not gonna take back the 10 dollars, are you? No, of course not. I gave it to you because I'm all for the cause. My name is Penelope Von Kruk. But everyone calls me Penny. My name is Sister Sara Jane. Sara Jane Butler. Well, would you like me to give you a lift back to your place, and you can send someone to get your car later? Well, I don't actually have a place locally. You see, I just got into LA today. I'm a traveling evangelist. Well, really, I don't have the money to have my car fixed. Well, Sister Sara Jane, you have just found yourself a new friend. A good Samaritan. I'll go to the payphone and call my mechanic, and he'll come down and get your car and get it fixed. Here's the keys to my trunk. You get whatever you need out of your car, and put it into my car, and you can consider yourself my guest for as long as you're in town. You mean it? I mean, no bullshit, you're really not putting me on? No, of course not. Now here, you take the keys. Get your stuff out of the car, put it into my car, and you can consider yourself my guest for as long as you're in town. Oh bless you, sister. You'll be rewarded for this, I know you will. Now go on, go on. I'll be right back. Sit down, make yourself at home. Oh, thank you. This is really a lovely place you have here. You must really have a good job, or something. I mean, you don't live here with anyone, do you? Do you have an old man or anything? Oh no, not me. I'm down on men. My family is loaded. They live in the East. They sort of pay me to stay away from them. They bought this house for me, and I've got two rental units. One rents to a young couple, and the other to an actress. Well anyway, enough about my personal life. How would you like something to drink? Maybe a nice tall glass of milk? Milk. Well something a little stronger, perhaps. Even in the bible, they use wine. For medicinal purposes, of course. Maybe some scotch, straight? Well, I'm all out of scotch right now. But I do have some wine. Would that be okay? Oh that would be just fine, Penny, thank you. Okay, I'll go get it for you. Here, here we go. Here's your glass. I'll pour the wine. Oh my goodness. Well Sister Sara Jane, this is the bedroom. Yes, Penny, this will do fine. I thought you might be interested in this. It's very very old. I saw it. I saw it in my vision. Kneel down, Penny. You are here to take the vow of secrecy and obedience to Sister Sara's sacred order, of the sisters of complete subjugation. [Penny] Yes, oh yes. You will do whatever you are told. You will help me rid this world of pleasurable sex, and evil men. Yes, yes. I will, Sister Sara. You are my first disciple. You will wear this ring. Take the vows after me. I vow. [Penny] I vow. To do whatever Sister Sara says. [Penny] To do whatever Sister Sara says. Without any question. [Penny] Without any question. It is time for the initiation to begin. When I tell you, you will get up, you will go immediately to the bed. (light eerie music) I vow to do everything I'm told to do. I vow to do everything I'm told to do. [Sara] Without question.

(laughing maniacally) (Penny screaming) Now that the initiation is over, tell me, Sister Penny, how do you feel about making love to a woman? Well. You see, Sister Sara Jane. I'm a lesbian. That's why my family disowned me. But, I'll stop it. I will, honest. I'll do anything you say. I have a strange compulsion to obey you. That's fine. Do you have any girlfriends, Penny? Just one, Junie. But I'll get rid of her, I promise. Then that's the way it must be. I feel that between us, now that the initiation is over, between us, we can do a great thing. Every man in America will be a potential target for us. You can go out into the bars, and you can lure them, and bring them home. And together, we can do them in. Yeah. I can't go to bars anymore. I feel that I would soon be into the big time, maybe my own TV show. Let me see. Stand up, Sister Penny. Let me look at you. Okay. Take off your robe. Turn around. [Penny] This good enough? Oh yes. We'll fix you up. We'll fix you up fine. You'll be my lure. And you can bring the men home. And we'll do it together. Oh, oh that sounds so, so fantastic. I can't wait. I'm really ready.

Scram, beat it, dog. Listen, you bitch. Who do you think you're talking to? [Sara] Who do you think you are? Listen, I know all about you. Stop it right now. So don't think you can pull anything over. I'd like to call the cops on you. You don't fool me one bit. Oh. Junie, I don't really see any reason for that. I mean, we're all adults. I see no reason why we couldn't sit down and talk this over. I mean, after all, it's just that Sister Penny here has found another way. Sure. She has discovered religion. I mean, there must be plenty of other girls in LA that you could get. That's right, Junie. I'm a new woman now. I have a purpose, a cause. Penny, you poor thing. You'd follow anybody that you thought needed you. This phony holy roller doesn't need you. She's just after your money. - I am not. - How much has she gotten from you so far? I am not after her money. I've never asked her for a penny. She gives me money freely. But, I should be on my way. - No. - There's lots of sin in San Francisco. I could go there and preach the word. I'm needed there. No Sara, please. - Don't go. - Yes, yes I have to go. It's not because I'm afraid of you. I want you to know that. But I should be moving on. You stay here. You're a good girl. Junie. No. All that money I gave her, I did it because I wanted to. Sara, if you're gonna go, I wanna go with you. No, you stay here with Junie. She loves you. You stay with her. I'll get my things. Thank you for everything, Penny. But... She'll stay with you. But Sara. I don't want you to go. You stay here with Junie. Junie, just exactly what is it you know about Sister Sara Jane? Well, I know that she doesn't have a license to be soliciting money that way that she is. You shouldn't let her take all your money. Oh, well, gosh. Junie, I didn't know she didn't have a license to solicit money. I mean, she was so good to me. She gave me a cause and everything. I know, she's just a phony. Can't you get that through your head? She is a phony. But she's a really good person. I'll be leaving now. Thank you Sister Penny for everything. Bye, Sister Sara. Sister Penny. - Thank you, again. - Bye. Carry on the word. Carry it on. Oh I will, Sister Sara Jane. I'll carry it on, I promise. I'll do my best. I'm sorry, Junie. I didn't mean to be so dumb. It's just that, she was nice to me and everything. It's okay, don't worry about it. Will you forgive me? Sure, sure. Maybe we could get reacquainted, and I'll stop acting like a dodo. We can make up for lost time. Good. - Okay. - Okay. Let's go sit down. Come on, Junie. Sit down. I'm so sorry about the stupid way I acted. I really have been a dumb cunt. But I'll make it up to you, and I'll never do that again. I'll never be taken in by some dumb stupid phony religious fanatic. You really learned the best. But I'm really glad to have you back. I can't believe it. I really missed you. What gave you the light? I mean, you know, after all of that time with her. Well, I didn't realize how much I missed you, Junie, until I saw you standing there at the door, and I saw your eyes and your hair, and I knew it was you all the time. I knew that everything you said was right about Sara Jane. That she was a phony, and it was all my fault. And I'll never do it again. And I'm gonna make it up to you. Oh, I'm gonna be so good to you. You certainly are anxious. Wait a minute. Well we've gotta make up for lost time. My goodness. Come on. You come over here. That's it. There. [Junie] You make me feel so pretty. I'm so glad to see you again. I'm glad you're glad. Did you really miss me, Junie? [Junie] Oh, you didn't know how much. [Penny] Oh, I'm so glad. 'Cause I missed you, too. (moaning) Oh Junie. Hold me. Don't ever leave me again. I trust you, and I need you to stay here with me. I don't want you to go away again, so all these horrible people can take advantage of me. Oh. Oh, Junie.
