Yeah, it wasn't an ax, it was a saw. What a boob. Simple?Right, yeah... It's, uh, appetizing looking, too. Yes. [BELL DINGING] I gotta hit the bank. Now, I won't be back for the mid-morning rush.

We don't have school today, so you don't have to bug me about it. I'm not buggin' you about it. I'm just tellin' you, if you ever wanna get anywhere in school, you gotta hit the books. Hey, don't sit there. Why not? Public bench, isn't it? You're sitting on gum. What?You know, you're sitting on gum. [IMITATES CHEWING] Gum. [GROANS] [EXCLAIMS] Well, why didn't you tell me before I sat down? You didn't give me a chance. Ah, nuts. MAN ON RADIO: And the fire department was able to contain the blaze at McGowan's Diner before it spread to adjoining buildings. Although the diner was full, there were no injuries reported. MIKE: Gee, McGowan's caught on fire! Yeah, I know. You wanna turn that thing off? I'm trying to eat. [TURNS OFF RADIO] What's that thing? It's a fried egg sandwich. No bread? Where do you buy a sandwich like that? Uh, I got it at a fire sale. Tough day, huh? Yeah, I'll get 'em tomorrow. You know what? I told my old man when I grew up I wanted to be just like you. You did? Gee, what'd he say? He hit me. Oh, well, it figures. Says you'll never amount to a hill of beans. You wanna turn the radio on? I'd rather listen to that. MAN ON RADIO: ...prizes! 50,000 dollars. So, send in those coupons to Kent Bronson at the Kent Bronson Show. VERNON: 50,000 dollars? You know somethin', if I had that kind of money, believe me, you guys wouldn't be throwin' a ratty ball around a dump like this. And I'd have you some uniforms and a ball diamond that'd knock your eyes out. You mean that?Yeah. You ain't gonna do that. I am, too. Of course with some people, it takes 'em a little longer than others. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] You Vernon Praiseworthy? Uh, right. The fireman told me that he saw you come down this way. You free to come with me? Well, take me to jail. It was that last order. The BLT, hold the mayo, slaw on the side. That's the one that did it.Did what? That's when the grease hit the grill. What's up, Vernon? This fuzz over here's gonna toss Vernon in the cooler. What'd he do? What'd you do, Vernon? Well, I made a mistake. I, uh, I got up this morning. Come on. Think you'll get out in time to get us that ball diamond? Well, sure I will. Gosh, uh... You guys just stay warmed up till I get back. KOTCH: See that gate over there?VERNON: Yeah. KOTCH: Just go over and knock on it. VERNON: Don't you have to check me in? KOTCH: Just knock on the gate. Strange prison. So long. Just knock on the gate. All right, now, remember, nobody gets through the gate to the house without proper identification. All right.You got that? That sounds simple.All right. All right.I'm gonna be gone, now. Now wait...You're going on vacation? I'm going on vacation and I want you to take this. See what you can do with this. [KNOCKING ON GATE]Okay, let him in. I'll handle it... Halt! No one gets through the gate without a pass. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...Proper identification. There was this man, Mr. Kotch, down there who, uh, said for me to come in here and go... No, no, no, no, this man's okay. Yeah, yeah. You go down the path, okay, to the house. You'll be all right. Thank you. [DOOR OPENS] May I help you?Uh, yes. Um, two guards down at the gate told me to come up here, and... Actually the one guard told me the one with the gun, confused. He, uh, gave me this card to come up here... I'm V. Praiseworthy. He left an "E" outta there, but it's Praiseworthy. Yes, we've been expecting you. Just step through there, please. I'm gonna give him this back, he was kind. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] [SWITCHES OFF TRAIN] Um, sorry, hope you didn't mind. Just runnin' the trains here. It's quite an exhibit you have here. TRAYNE: One of the finest in the country. [DOOR OPENS] Oh. Took me 25 years to get together. There's a model of anything that's ever rolled on wheels. I wouldn't sell it for a million dollars. Surprised to see a dog sitting' here, weren't you? I never talk to anybody until Bo looks 'em over. If he don't pass 'em, I don't waste my time with 'em. Can't beat an animal for judging human character, and Bo's the best that ever was. So, you're Vernon Praiseworthy? Come closer. Uh-uh, that's close enough. You look better at a distance. Anybody tell you who I am? Uh, well, the warden. Warden? Well, uh, you see there was this guy, Kotch, and he has this little car and he had a badge and he came up and arrested me, so I just assumed that... He didn't arrest you. He's a private detective. Oh. Bo, get Mitchell in here. [TOLLING] Mitchell, this is Vernon Praiseworthy. Oh, oh, yes. Tell him who I am. This is Mr. R. R. Trayne, founder and Chairman of the Board of Trayne Industries. Uh, Choo-Choo Trayne? Yeah. You heard of me, huh? Oh, gee, who hasn't? I mean, a guy who started out as a hobo and then became a billionaire. I mean... Billion and three-quarters. Now, tell him who he is. Well, I'm Vernon Praiseworthy of the... No, no, no, tell him. You, sir, are Mr. Trayne's last living relative. Well... I beg your pardon? I said, you are Mr. Trayne's last living relative. You mean that I, that he, that we that that this place, that I... [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Kinda give you a choke, didn't I? Well, it doesn't seem possible. I mean you sure there isn't some mistake? No, no, it's been checked, double-checked, cross-checked, rechecked and it all checks. Your mother was my sister. And you are the caboose on the family train. [BO WHIMPERING] [BARKING] Ah, you're right, Bo, it's nothin' to joke about. Boy, it's like a dream. I mean, uh... Gosh, uh... Choo-Choo Trayne, my uncle. Come over here, son. Come over here and take a look. This is me ridin' the rails. This is me ridin' the rails at the age of 16. Skinny little runt, wasn't I? Uh-huh. This is me ridin' the rails with some of my buddies. That's Butz Collins, Stumpy Walder, and Ray Turner. You know what this is a picture of? Uh, that... That's a picture of, uh, a roundhouse. No. That is a picture of nothing. All of these pictures are nothing. I thought so. No, I couldn't afford a camera or a film when I was bumming, so, I took all these pictures all here in my head. Now, I can buy any of the camera companies. I like my pictures better. Don't you? Yes, now that you mention it, yeah. You know what this is a picture of? Sure. That's a picture of nothing. This is a picture of you as the head of Trayne Enterprises. Maybe.Right. Takes a big man to run a big organization and on account of you being family, we hoped you'd be the man when I step down. Right, Bo? [BARKS] When I look at your record, here, it doesn't even give a promise. Says here, 39 jobs, in 34 cities. What is your hang-up? I'm lookin' for a job where I can be happy and make a lot of money for the kids. Kids? Don't see anything here about you havin' kids. I don't, I don't... It's just that, uh, I mean, kids that don't have anything. I'd like to do something for 'em. Good, I like that. Come around here. Sit down. Go ahead, sit down. Relax, make yourself comfortable. Think you could be happy in this niche when I give it up? Yeah, I guess so, but, well, see, you just said... I just said you had nothin' to offer right now, but I've got a prescription that could change all that if you work at it. Well, uh, I'm willin' to work, all right, it's um, it's just workin' steady that's a little shaky. This'll be different than anything you've ever tried before. Well, where do we start? Where I did. On the road. Oh, you mean a salesman? I think I can handle that. Hobo. A hobo? TRAYNE: Mmm-hmm. Taught me everything I needed to put me in this chair. Self-reliance, self-confidence, resourcefulness, ingenuity, the whole bundle, and it could do the same for you. Gosh, a hobo. From now on you better forget that name, Vernon Praiseworthy. No use adding to your troubles. You need a nice, short, snappy name, like Tom, Dick, Harry, Frank, Joe. Joe, Bo, Joe, Bo, Joe. Sounds good either way. How about that, Bo? [WHIMPERING] Good. Joe it is. We'll tack a "Smith" on the end when we write you. Hobo?Mmm-hmm. You follow my footsteps and you can step into my shoes. Yeah, uh, not bad. Well, how long is this gonna take? Depends upon you. Yeah, well, okay, I'll give it a try, I mean, for the kids. [BARKS] Your first destination will be Seattle. That's about a four-day run. Seein' as how you're a beginner, I'll give you six. If it takes any longer, that's one strike against you, just like baseball. Oh, you mean, three strikes and you're out? That's right. Now there's a freight leavin' the yard at, uh, 2:45. I'll give you three hours and ten minutes to hop it. You mean, you want me to start today? Sooner you start, the quicker you finish. Well, you, but three hours and ten minutes, I need more time than that. Average person always needs more tire, that's why they're average. One thing that'll make it easier for you is that you'll have somebody to travel with you. Oh, you're gonna send Mitchell with me. Mitchell? Wouldn't that be something. [LAUGHING] You and Mitchell hoboing together. No, I'm gonna have somebody to help you rather than hinder you. Just like his great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great granddaddy helped me with mine. You mean, you're gonna send Bo with me? That's right. He's a real chip off the old block, loyal and a lot smarter than most people you run across. But Bo's your dog, see, he wouldn't wanna go with me. Ask him. Bo, you wanna go with me? For my sake, Bo? [WHIMPERS] Good. I had an agreement drawn up to cover the deal. Mitchell, explain it to him. There are several major provisions. You must never reveal your relationship to Mr. Trayne. You must never disclose the reasons for what you're doing. You must never contact this office or Mr. Trayne unless you are instructed to do so. Stealing, cheating, or other dishonest acts are strictly forbidden. You will follow a prescribed route which will be given to you one destination at a time. Upon arrival at a designated city, a letter at the main post office, general delivery, will give you your next destination. [HORN BLOWING] [WHISTLE BLOWING] Hurry up, Bo, come on, that's our train. Get away! Go away! [BO BARKING]Hey, Bo! Bo! Hey, Bo! [EXCLAIMING] [SCREAMING] TRAYNE: Oh, forget it. I'll never make a train man outta you. Yes, sir, but I am trying, sir, I really am, I'm trying. [PHONE RINGING]Try harder. Answer the phone. Yes? Yes, put him on. What is that? Joe? Bo? Yes, sir. Mitchell speaking. Good. They did? They didn't. They are? What do know... Thank you. Well? That was the division superintendent. Yes, I know that. What is all they did, they didn't, they are? Did they catch the freight train or didn't they? Well, yes sir, they did, sir, but... They didn't catch the one going to Seattle. They're heading in the opposite direction. Where? El Paso. Now, what do you know? Yes sir, that's what I said, sir. [LAUGHING] He's followin' in my footsteps all right. The first train I ever hopped I went in the wrong direction, too. Hey, watch the bridge. I will, I will, I'll watch the bridge now. [LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY] How come we're stoppin'? [BARKS]Huh? Hey, come on, somebody's comin'. Let's get outta sight. No need to hide. I know you're in there. Uh, you gonna put us off? No need to, once you hear where you're headin'. Well, we're goin' to Seattle. No. Seattle is that-a-way. You're going to El Paso. Wait a minute. El Paso! What... Now, wait a minute, that's impossible. You see, I heard personally from two... I mean, uh, from a very high authority that the train leaving for Seattle left precisely at 2:45 and that's what time we were on this. The freight for El Paso also leaves at 2:45. You mean, you got two trains going in opposite directions leaving at the same time? Opposite directions, same time. You don't have another train leaving the other way, do you? Yeah, 1:17 tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning? Oh, we'd lose a whole day. Yeah, see, we've only got six days to get to Seattle... We're under a lot of pressure... I know, I know... You know, in a case like this, I think it'd be okay to go out on the highway and catch a ride that way, don't you? What? I'm sorry, I was talking to the dog. [BARKS] He said it's okay. Excuse me. Well, thanks a lot, you've been very helpful. My pleasure. [BARKING] Have a nice day yourself. Stacy, can you hear me? STACY: Yeah, I hear you. Tell 'em they got off here. Will do. Did you find out why the top brass is keeping track of 'em? No, but I did find out one thing though. What's that? That the dog is the smarter of the two. Now, that's 41 cars that have gone by and haven't even looked at us. [BARKING] Hi, there's plenty of room in there for us. [SIGHS] Well, you know, it's so hot out here. We're gonna melt. I wonder what you have to do to get anybody to stop around here. [WHIMPERING] Bo, what happened? Bo, come on, speak to me. Hey, Bo, hey, what's wrong, guy? Help! Help! Help! Bo, what's wrong? I'll give you mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Well, just... Forget it. Oh, come on, get up. We gotta keep goin' for the kids. [BUS APPROACHING] What happened? Car hit him? Well, I don't know. He just keeled over. Must be the heat. Well, pour some of this on him. Oh, right. Thanks. This'll work, here, here you go. Here. [WHIMPERING] Aw, that's great. Yeah, that works. Thanks a million. You just saved me a billion. Uh, where you going? L.A. Pile in.Huh? Come on, Bo, we got a ride. Bo! Hey, come on, let's go. Bo, got a ride. Come on, come on, Bo, let's go. Well, come on. Oh, no, come on. TRAYNE: You can't beat an animal for judging human character, and Bo is the best that there is. You're supposed to be taking care of me. TRAYNE: Now, he's gonna need a lot of lookin' after, but don't be too easy on him, or he'll never learn anything. That's better. My name is, uh, Steve. This is Ernie. ERNIE: Hi. Hi, mine is Vern... I mean, uh, Joe. Bo, Joe, Bo, Joe. [BO BARKS]Hey, Bo! [GROWLS]Hey, now easy. Not very friendly, is he? Yeah, I don't understand that. It must be the heat. Hey, what's with you, anyway? He's a real nice guy. [SNARLING] Yeah, all right, okay. He's, uh, just apologizing for growling. That's okay, your apology is accepted. Where you coming from, Joe? L.A. You see, I was going to Seattle, but I didn't catch the right freight, so... So I'm goin' back to Los Angeles to hop a freight to Seattle, so, I guess I'm really coming from Los Angeles, if you look at it that way. Hot, isn't it? Our security department is the very finest. Your little Johnny will be in the best of hands. [PHONE RINGING] Trayne World Airways Security. Hey, am I glad to hear from you. No, we're just coming into town. When will you be at the house? Yeah, we'll be in, in about 45 minutes. Yeah, we gotta take this guy over to the freight yards. JEN: Freight yards? Dave get there yet? Two days ago. Good. Where is he? A liquor store? What is it? What is it? All right, we'll see you at the place. Stupid idiot. Come on, man, lay it on me. What's happenin'? He tried to knock off a liquor r store. They picked him off instead. He's in the County Hospital with a slug in his leg. Oh, that's beautiful, that's really beautiful. The guy plays penny ante and we lose the whole jackpot, that's great. We haven't blown it yet. We'll get somebody else. What, by tomorrow morning? You gotta be kidding. STEVE: So, how did you happen to take up hoboing, Joe? Well, I was told there was a lot of money in it. All ready for you to jump into, Joe. Better than a bed roll, huh, Joe? Well, any bed's better than a bed roll. Boy, you guys sure have been good to me. Well, we just wanna show our appreciation, Joe, for you driving the van for us tomorrow. Yeah, well, listen, anything as long as I'm through in time to catch that freight to Seattle. ERNIE: Oh, man, we'll be through in plenty of time. I mean, it won't take us more than an hour. Unless there's a snafu. Then all of us might be hopping the freight. Huh? Well, I mean, we might get a flat tire on the freeway or somethin'. Yeah, yeah, we know what you mean, Ernie. I think you better hit the sack, too. Okay? Your mouth is flapping but your brains are sleeping. Okay. JEN: Good night, Joe. Ow! Geez! I'm gonna get a new tube. Turn that off. [SIGHS] Oh. [HUMMING] More coffee, Joe? Uh, no, I have to drive. Hey, how about this last egg, Joe? Uh, no, no, I've, uh, I've had a lot of eggs this week. How 'bout you, Bo? [WHIMPERING] You about ready to shove off, Joe boy? Yeah, right, I'm ready, right. I'm sorry, here you go. I'll help you. Here's your butter, butter. You need any help? No, thank you.Good. Right. Boy, you know it's hard to believe you guys work for Trayne. Yeah? Why? Well, I mean, of all the companies that you could work for. Of course, he does own a lot of companies, doesn't he? So, doesn't that make a coincidence, huh? I don't know why he'd bring it up. That's strange. [BOTH LAUGHING] He's funny. I see. Mmm-hmm, thank you. Well? Nothing, sir. They've dropped out of sight since they left that siding to catch a ride back to Los Angeles. Their first night out on the road. Wonder where they're spending it? Well, they oughta be showin' up at the freight yard before long. All right, the plane's coming in pretty quick. They're gonna park it just on the other side of that fence over there. ERNIE: Okay.Okay? All right, now, here are the keys. Now, you know where you're gonna meet us now. Well, yeah, you told me three times. Well, I just wanna make sure everything's okay because I don't want no bad mark on our record, know what I mean? Right, okay, I got it. You know, you worry too much, see? Where was it?Over there. I got it, see, I got it. You got it. This is Barbara Henderson of KGHG bringing you an on-the-spot picture of the arrival of Li Chien Wu, a very rare species of Chinese dog know as a Shar-Pei, which is being flown to this country on a special plane furnished by Trayne World Industries, as a gift from the People's Republic of China to the people of the United States. Li Chien Wu is no ordinary gift, I assure you, for he is the Republic's Number One Shar-pei and is valued and insured for 100,000 dollars. How's it look? Okay. How about mine? Outta sight. Yeah?Yeah. Good, good. All right. Hey. Hi. Hey, you fellas here to pick up the pooch? Yeah. Hey, uh, is that the plane? GUARD: It better be. When did they put you fellas on? A while ago. One shot deal. They figured a little extra security might be a smart idea, you know? Their dough. Where's your station? They told us to stick right with you. Hey, uh, we can hold up our end over here, you know? Well, that's a matter of opinion. Oh, I had a hunch there was something funny about you guys. Give me the irons. Right now. Move it! All right, hold it right there. Tape his kisser. Move! Get in. Let me repeat, that the ceremony will not take place today. Li Chien Wu has traveled a long way and will be taken from here to a kennel for a check-up, after which the President himself will receive the gift from the People's Republic in a special ceremony two days from now. Oh, oh, oh, yes. Representing our government on this occasion today is Mr. Leonard Cox of the State Department. Oh, they're moving the ladder... How do you do, ladies and gentlemen? This is Leonard Cox speaking, your State Department representative. I'm very happy to be here today to welcome Li Win Chu... Oh, Mr. Cox is a little excited. He meant to say Li Chien Wu. Yes, yes, yes. I mean to say Li Chien Wu. In the name of the government... Okay, Mr. Cox, thank you, thank you. Hey, look, Bo, there's Rita and Jen. [BARKING] Bo! Bo, be quiet. For cryin' out loud, they're gonna throw us outta here. Can't you see, they're trying to broadcast? Here comes trouble. Keep that dog quiet or take him out of here. Yes sir, uh, I'm sorry, I don't know what got into him. COX: Well, see that it doesn't get into him again. We're having a brief interruption caused by a dog belonging to a spectator. I'm sure it's nothing serious. Mr. Cox himself has gone over to remedy the situation. COX: I'm here on government business, and I will not tolerate interruption. Is that clear? Keep quiet! Come, Bo, you hear what he said? COX: Let's get on with the reception, Stevens. [CROWD CHATTERING] [BARKS] Hey, Bo, look, that must be the Shar-Pei they're talking about. [WHIMPERING] Boy, I hope he gets big enough to fill out those wrinkles. Welcome to the United States, Madame Wong. Thank you. I am Leonard Cox of the State Department, Madame Wong. I'm here to welcome you to our country on behalf of the United States Government. Thank you. I bring you greetings from the People's Republic of China. Ah, yes, yes, yes. Madame Wong, how was your flight? My flight... But, most importantly, how is Li Chien Wu? My flight was very pleasant and Li Chien Wu is very happy. But I'm sure he's tired after his long trip, so we'll just rush him to the kennel where he can relax and get over his jetlag. All right, be cool now, Ernie. I got it. Be cool. [BO BARKING] Bo! [BARKING] Sit down. He's okay. Hey, come back here. Oh, no! Now look what you did. Here comes wrinkles. [LI CHIEN WU BARKING] Go back! Go. That's Bo and Joe. COX: Now, look what you've done. Oh, you, you, oh, come here, poor little Li Chien Chu! Oh... Will you get out of here? Yes sir, right, sir. Ah, you see, I read about Li Chien Wu in the paper and when my friends told me he was comin' down here this morning well, I figured I'd... We're on our way, right now. Come on, Bo. Bo! Let go of the man's leash, Bo. Bo, let go of the man's leash. You party pooper! You shouldn't have done that. Now look, you got him all excited. Uh, sir, we're sorry, sir, just, uh... Will you get out of here? Come on, Bo. Uh, I'm sorry, sir. We broke your leash. Here you go, just... Just... [CROWD LAUGHING] What is the matter with you? You bumbling idiot, what're you doing? Get your hands off me. What's the matter with you, Bo? You're supposed to keep me out of trouble, not get me into it. Come on. Now, that the confusion and excitement is over, we're going to pause for station identification. Excitement is right. Bo certainly had them spinning their wheels, didn't he? He must've taken a shine to that Li Chien Wu. What the devil are they doing at the airport? They're supposed to be hopping a freight to Seattle. [BO GROWLING] [BARKING] Take it easy. All right. To the side. Let's go. Easy now. Will you stop being so restless, for cryin' out loud. They'll be here. [BARKING] Bo, will you quiet down, for cryin' out loud? Get in. How do you like that? They don't even have freight trains on their schedule. Now that's another thing I'm gonna change when I get in that chair. [BARKING] [WHIMPERING] Bo, will you settle down? [BO GROWLING] What is it, Bo? What, huh? Bo! Bo! Hey, will you come on, hey, come on, sit down. Sit down. I'm sorry. Now, lay down there. Okay, come on. I don't know what's gotten into Bo today. You shoulda seen the fuss he made over that Li Chien Wu at the terminal. Boy! STEVE: Yeah, we heard all about it. Let's get going, huh? Yeah, yeah, sure, yeah, okay. [ENGINE STARTING] [WHIMPERING] [LI CHIEN WU BARKING] Now see, you been barkin' so much you're getting laryngitis. [BARKING CONTINUES] Hey, that sounds like Li Chien Wu! [WHIMPERING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Li Chien Wu! What's he doin' here? Well, uh... Well, we were going to deliver him after we dropped you off at the freight yard. Oh, all right. [BARKING] Huh? Huh, huh? Oh. Hey, one of you guys dropped your mustache here. Hey, wait a minute. Hey, hey, you were the guys with the dog kennel down at the airport. So, that's what you were tryin' to tell me, huh, Bo? Hey, you guys aren't security guards, you're phonies. And you kidnapped Li Chien Wu. And you just missed that freight to Seattle, Joe. [BO GROWLING] Bo, stay. Or I'll blow you away. Turn off at the street. Oh, no, you're not makin' a dognapper outta me. I'm not goin' anywhere unless it's to take Li Chien Wu to the dog kennel. You wanna bet? Turn left? I'll get right to that. [ENGINE STARTING] And I'm happy to report that Li Wien Chu is in the Metropolitan Kennel now for a two-day check up. Li Chien Wu, Mr. Cox. Li Chien Wu. I'm also happy to report that... Mr. Cox...In a minute, Stevens. Where was I, let's see... Li Chien Wu's in the Metropolitan Kennel, uh, yes, yes. And I'm happy to say that, uh... He's not at the Metropolitan Kennel. Of course he is. That's where they took him. But they didn't.They didn't? No. Then where is he? I don't know. Well, if you don't know where he is, how do you know he's not at the Metropolitan Kennel? He's been stolen. Stolen? What do you mean, stolen? Grabbed! Snatched! Purloined! Dognapped! Oh, stolen. Oh, no. The kennel just called a few minutes ago. The truck was left in a city park with the driver and two guards locked inside. They managed to get loose just a few minutes ago. Stolen? This is awful. Why, the presentation ceremony's set in a couple of days. Do you know what this means if we don't get that dog back? [CHATTERING ON TV] [WHIMPERING] Well, that was pretty good. I think I'll have another one. You want a coke, Joe? The only thing Joe wants is to go to Seattle. I'll tell you somethin', if I don't get to Seattle in six days, I'm gonna have one strike against me. This is Barbara Henderson of KGHG with a late news flash. This morning I covered the arrival of Li Chien Wu, a very rare and valuable Chinese dog that was flown here from China as gift from the People's Republic to the people of this country. Well, there may not be any ceremony, for I have just learned that Li Chien Wu has been stolen. No! That's right, stolen. The daring dognapping was carried out within minutes of Li Chien Wu's arrival by two men posing as security guards while a third member of the gang waited in a getaway car. Wait a minute. I'm not a member of the gang. Stay tuned to this station for continuing developments. With all the security we've got at the airport, they couldn't even secure a dog. Well, you'll have to admit that it was an unusual and daring plot. It's the unusual you have to anticipate. Any fool can plan for the usual. I'll bet that's why Bo raised all that ruckus at the fence. He smelled out them crooks and he was going to save Li Chien Wu. It's too bad that somebody else at the airport didn't have as much brains as he has. [SIGHS] Any word from 'em at the freight yard? No, sir. Well, they missed the mornin' freight. Now, they missed the afternoon freight. I wonder what the devil they're up to now? [WHIMPERING] [DOORBELL RINGING] Hi.Well, we did it. Boy, you should've seen that airport. They're runnin' around there like a bunch of bananas. Hey, what do you think of all this, Chow Mein? Betcha you didn't think you'd end up here, right? ERNIE: Hi.Hi. Hey... What's he doin' here? Yeah, what's this? Well, he decided to join up with us. I did not. He got wise. Where's Bo? STEVE: Locked in the shed. He won't give us any trouble. Yeah, I'll tell you somethin', if anything happens to Bo, you guys are answering to me. [STEVE LAUGHING] This is Barbara Henderson in the office of Leonard Cox of the State Department as he anxiously awaits word from the dognappers of Li Chien Wu. What was the motivation for this dognapping? Will you please stop that infernal whispering? Please, Mr. Cox, we're or the air, live. I must have been crazy to let you people in here. COX: Oh, aspirin, aspirin. I need more aspirin. HENDERSON: And that man you hear in the background is Mr. Cox himself. As you can tell, the tension here in his office is mounting by by the minute. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? It's them. Yes. What? 100,000 dollars? Yes, yes, I'll pay that. I mean, the government will. Would you repeat that? This looks like it, folks. The dognappers have just demanded 100,000 dollar ransom for the return of Li Chien Wu. Oh, wait a minute. How can I be sure that you have Ching Li Ku? What? Okay, Li Chien Wu. How many wrinkles did he have? Was he wearing a harness or a collar? All right, I believe you. [FINGER SNAPPING] I'll call you later with the details. [RINGS OFF] Wait a minute. Hello? Hello? Ah, they hung up. Is that what they asked for, Mr. Cox? 100,000 dollars? Uh, that is correct. Frankly, I would've paid them twice that much. [SHUSHING] We're on the air. What do you mean, we're still on the air? [PHONE RINGING] Hello? What? Oh, wonderful! Well, we're up to 200,000 now. Care to try for four? Oh, shut up. I'll tell you what. Uh, if you let me and Bo go, I'll give you 300,000 dollars. We'll take it, let's see the dough. Well, I'm a little short right now. But, I'll tell you what, I'll give you a note and six percent interest. Payable when? Uh, when I own a bank. I'm gonna be a billionaire. How about eight percent and I'll let you join the Christmas club? I told you he was a ding-a-ling. STEVE: Gather around, I'll lay out the pick-up plans for you. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] All right. Now this is the Barclay Department Store, okay? And the plaza shopping area. Okay, this is the parking lot on the... Foothill Boulevard side. Okay? All right, now the front is... Steve. Let the dummy listen. He won't do anything about it after we get through with him. [JEN CHUCKLING] Okay, then we pick up the dough, wheel to the airport, hop into our chartered plane, and fly on down to South America. [EXCLAIMING IN SPANISH] How about that, huh? ERNIE: That's beautiful, man, that's great. STEVE: All right, I always like to start on a full stomach. Now, how about you girls makin' it with a can opener? JEN: Back in a flash with some hash. Hey, give me a cigarette, will you? Get out of here. Wanna get us in trouble? [WHIMPERING] Go on, go on, get away. [BARKING] Not you. All right, what's bugging him? [STUTTERING] I don't... [WHIMPERING] What'd you see down there, Li Chien Wu? Oh, it was just a mouse, just a mouse. A mouse? Ew! [EXCLAIMING] I saw one in the kitchen a while ago. Now stay there. You fool with these American mice and you're liable to get mugged. You girls have any coffee there? [MAN CHATTERING ON TV] [SWITCHING CHANNELS] Put that back, will you? These guys are gonna get mad. Hey! Give me that. [GROWLING]Ah! All right. Hold it right there. Put your hands up. Put your hands up. Geez! Ouch! RITA: Oh, wow! What happened, Steve? Never mind. Easy... All right! Now, uh, just gimme that gun. Take it out with two fingers, and hand it to Bo. Go get it, Bo. Okay, here, give me that. Ah-ha! So, you guys thought... [GROWLING] Hold it right there. Thought you're dealin' with some kind of dumb... Dummy, huh? All right, okay. Okay, you wise guys, it looks like you're outta business, huh? Okay, come on, Bo. Get Li Chien Wu and let's get outta here. Come on. You guys are goin' to jail where you belong. I'm gonna fire a couple of blasts outside and the cops will be here in no time. Ah-ha. So you guys thought you're dealin' with some kind of a pushover, huh? A ding-a-ling, huh? Well, we'll see who has the last laugh now. [EXCLAIMS] [GROANS] [DOOR CLOSES] STEVE: So?No luck. We toured the whole neighborhood. I mean, not a sign of him. Yeah, I beat around the bushes like I was on a rabbit hunt. I mean, what do we do now? Same as we planned. Yeah, but we don't have Chow Mein anymore. So, who knows that but us? JEN: Yeah, but somebody might see him. STEVE: In the dark? Not much chance. COX: 200,000 dollars, eh? Did you do whatever you guys call it? Bug it? We sure did. Wherever that suitcase goes, we'll know it. Wherever it goes, I go until I get Li Chien Wu back... [PHONE RINGING] Hello? This is Cox. Yes? Uh, would you repeat that please? The gasoline station at Foothill and Humboldt. 8:30. I'll be there. Yes, yes, yes, I'll do exactly as you say. So, they're gonna make the drop at Foothill and Humboldt. I think I better go in alone. FIELDS: No!No, no. They warned me against trying to double-cross 'em, and I don't want to. Can't let you do that, Mr. Cox. We wanna get those monkeys. You'll get those monkeys after I get my doggie and I don't want anybody jeopardizing my chances. All right. How about this? [CAR STARTING] [BARKING] [WHIMPERING] [VERNON GROANING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] How do you do? I represent the Wilson Brush... [GRUNTING] Oh, excuse me, sir, I didn't mean to interrupt your meditation, but I represent the Wilson Brush Company and I'd like to give you a gift. It's a giant pea shucker. You run the pea pod straight through the center of this here... [BOTH GRUNTING] Take it off? This is a Wilson beauty. 100 percent nylon, life-time guaranteed hair brush. I'm sure you wanna buy one. Mmm-hmm. Fine. [EXCLAIMS] Get my legs untied. How about this genuine tortoise shell comb? I'm sure you'd like to buy that, too. I'll take the comb, I'll take the brush, I'll take everything. Just get my legs untied. Wait a second, just... Just stay still for a minute. How'd you get like this, anyway? Who tied you up? Hey, baby, watch the brushes, man. Hey, man, you're sloppin' on the brushes. Be cool man. I've to pay for them. Hey, watch the brushes, man. Must be some kind of weirdo meditating with ropes on you. I gotta call the police. Police? Hello? Give me the police. Look, uh, the original price is 12 dollars, but for you, I'll give you a real bargain, six fifty. You can never get the police when you want 'em, you know it? Four fifty. [BO GROWLING] A dollar? VERNON: Hello? Hello? Oh, no, tied me up with a telephone cord. Hello, phone repair? Come on, we gotta get to a phone. Come on, Bo, come on, we gotta get goin'. Come on. Oh, that's right. Here. That's right. Forgot Li Chien Wu. Okay, all right, come on now, let's go. Bo, will you hurry up? I gotta get to a phone. Come on, let's go. I gotta get to a phone. What am I supposed to do with keys, huh? [BO BARKING] That's an idea! Come on, we'll drive to a phone. Okay, get in there, go on, get in there. Okay. We gotta get to a phone. Wait a minute why should I get to a phone? I know the plan. I can stop 'em myself. All right, now look, you brought me the little dog, and you brought me the keys, but I'm drivin'. Ah, it's locked. Okay! [GRUNTING] How do you do that? [IN NASAL VOICE] I got the gearshift in my nose. Move over, I'll drive. That's good. Okay, here we go. Hey, how about the pea shucker? [BO BARKING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Speaking. The Foothill Plaza Shopping Center on Foothill Boulevard. Yes, I know where it is. Yes, yes, yes, I understand. Turn on the monitor. [MONITOR BEEPING] Can you hear me, Glen? Come in. GLEN ON RADIO: Yeah, I hear you. Come in. Are you in position, Glen? Come in. Yeah, just outside the back entrance. Come in. Good. Don't make any move unless I order it. Come in. Right. Ten-four. [ENGINE SPUTTERING] VERNON: Oh, no, I'm outta gas. You watch Li Chien Wu. Uh, I got, uh... Uh, you, hey... I've an emergency call. I have to call the police, uh... No, I gotta call the... Gotta call the police. Pardon me, I have to call the police. [GROANS] I have to make an emergency... [GROANS] [WHIMPERING] ERNIE: Don't turn around. Just listen. There's a men's room just inside that door, to your right. Go to an end booth and wait. Put the suitcase on the floor, sit down. If you wanna see Li Chien Wu again, don't try any tricks. Okay? Go on. Don't try any tricks. What's he going inside for? According to instructions, they're supposed to contact him in front. Turner, do you hear me? TURNER ON RADIO: Yeah, go ahead. Cox just went into the store. Can you see him? Come in. Yeah, I see him. He's going to the men's room. Come in. Nothing suspicious about that. I'd like to go myself. Ten-four. Hey, come on, this guy left his keys in the car. Let's go! Come on, Li Chien Wu. Come on. Get in. That's it, get in. Come on, Bo, let me help you open the door. Oh, good. Okay. [CAR STARTING] Hey! Hey, come back with my car. [TIRES SCREECHING] Hey, come back with my car! Hey! [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [FLUSHING] COX: Are you my contact? [IN RASPY VOICE] Yeah. Just sit tight. [MONITOR BEEPING] [FLUSHING] [MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY] Hey, we're getting some movement on the beep. Turner, come in. Turner, come in. Turner, come in! Turner here, come in. Where were you? Why didn't you answer me? I'm at the radio counter, Chief. Had to get some new batteries. You let Cox get away from you. Get over here to the car on the double. Glen, come in. Glen here, come in. They've just made contact with Cox. He's going somewhere with the money. We're gonna follow the beep. You follow us. Ten-four. Lucky thing for you we counted out just to the dollar. Now, where do I take the money? Just sit tight and don't move. Somebody will contact you later. Thank you.You're welcome. I don't see Mr. Cox. If they already made the pick-up, we're gonna have to catch them at the airport. I'll tell you what, you watch Li Chien Wu, I'm gonna check the men's room. Wait a minute. Get down. There's Ernie. And there's Rita and Jen. Hey, they got the carton with the money. You stay here. This is time for action. [WOMEN SCREAMING] [GROANING] I just saw Joe.Where'd he go? That way.He's got the money. The money! I got the money. Come on, let's get outta here. [ENGINE SPUTTERING] I'll tell you what, if I can get in the store, we'll be safe. Now, you stay here and watch Li Chien Wu. Oh, gosh!Well, Joe, boy! Now, wait a minute.Got outta the closet. Well, I don't have to worry about you anymore. [VERNON GROANING] Some guys are so hard to get along with. Hey, you got it back.How'd he get it? Well, he grabbed it from Jen. [WHIMPERING] You got it back! Wow! He popped outta nowhere, Steve. How'd you suppose he got loose? STEVE: Get in the car and we'll talk later. [BO BARKING] Shoot him if you have to. Oh, this bein' a hobo is murder. Hey, Bo! Hey, come here. Where'd you get this thing? Hey, come on let's give this thing a try again. Hurry! Come on, get in. Hurry up! STEVE: Ernie! [HONKING] RITA: Oh, wow! [CHATTER ON POLICE RADIO] Good evening. Boy, am I glad to see you guys. Why won't anybody believe me? I'm not one of the dognappers, I'm just a victim of circumstances. Look, Joe, if I told you the same story you told me, would you believe me? No. But I'm tellin' you, it's true. I'm gonna get some breakfast and some sleep, too. Good idea. Say, uh, put him back in his playpen. Well, at least can I take Bo with me? I'm sorry, that's against the rules. But don't worry, he'll be around. We're gonna keep him as a witness. You can even have visiting privileges. Oh, great, well, so long, Bo. See you in the yard. [BO BARKING] You know, fellow, I'd sure like to get to the bottom of this. It's too bad you can't talk. Hey! Hey, where're you goin' with my hat. Come back here. Hey! Hey, you! Hey, come on back here. Come on back, that's my new cap. And the bizarre ending to this case came last night when one of the dognappers tried to double-cross his confederates and crashed into a police car, bringing about the capture of all of them and the recovery of Li Chien Wu and the ransom. Also recovered was a pedigreed German Shepherd which, it is believed, also was stolen. Police are trying to put together the pieces of this intricate puzzle. Bo! What on Earth are you doin' here? What are you doin' with that? Where's Joe? [WHIMPERING] All right, go ahead. Come on. I don't know why they moved us in here. Ouch! [GROANS] Hey, come on! You mean, they found out the truth?Nope. Well, where am I goin'? Come on, don't ask any questions. Just tryin' to get along with people. Hey, get over here! Sorry, just thought I'd... [GROANING] PRISONER: Hey, fuzz! Hey, what do you say, Joe boy? Hey, wait a minute, I'm not goin' in there with those crooks. Get in. Hey, Joe, I thought you'd be on the way to Seattle by now. Well, I'm not talkin' to you guys. Hey, what do you being so uptight? I mean, the way I figure it, they only give one to ten years for a bank job nowadays. You shouldn't get no more than thirty days for a dog snatchin'. Especially if you're a first timer and you act really sorry. I mean, you are sorry for what you did, aren't you? The only thing that I'm sorry about is that I didn't listen to Bo. It seems to me that you stole a car, didn't you? You got caught with Li Chien Wu and the ransom, now didn't you? ERNIE: That's right, and you tried to double-cross us. Hunk the whole thing for yourself. Ah, now wait a minute, that's not true. I mean, I didn't know what you guys were doin'. Who's gonna prove it. Nobody knows that but us. And me. Why, that dirty, double-crossing... They planted a stool pigeon in our cell. That's a violation of our criminal rights. Give me that. [GROANING] [STUTTERING] Choo-Choo... Will you stop stutterin'? And shut up. Jailer! Jailer! You know somethin'? You fellows aren't so smart. Ingenuity. Ta-ta. It's for you, Joe. Huh? Oh. [BO GROWLING] "Dear Joe..." Well, you didn't travel very far mile wise, but you sure made progress in the learning department. You've shown you've got guts and you are honest. You're a good man, Joe. But not good enough yet. You've still got some miles to get under your belt. There's a freight leaving for Seattle at 2:00. If you stand with your back to the sun, it'll be traveling from right to left. Back to the... If you don't know your left from your right, Bo will show you. [BO BARKING] [WHIMPERING] All right, all right. Didn't believe me, did you? [SIREN WAILING] What'd he say? I'll put my back to the sun, that would be... That's your train over there. Oh, well, thanks. Come on, Bo, let's get in. Who is that guy? I don't know. That's what I was gonna ask you. All I know is the Chief gave orders to drive him down here. Well, I got orders from the superintendent to make sure I get him on the right train. Yeah. Aw, nuts, now I forgot my blanket. Look at this, he's comin' back. What is it? Forgot my bedroll. What?I forgot my bedroll. [BELL TOLLING] Just a minute. Hey! My train is leaving! WILSON: Stop! You got it wrapped around my head. Will you cut it out? Will you stop it? Get outta here. [BARKING] [WHISTLE BLOWING] Now, I'm never gonna get to Seattle. [BO BARKING]It's not one of my better days. Hold up, R.J., hold up. Come on, let's go. [HORN BLARING] What happened? Aw, I tripped. Uh, what's the train stoppin' for? Stoppin' for you. For me?
