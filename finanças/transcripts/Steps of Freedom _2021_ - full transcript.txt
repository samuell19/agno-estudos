Confucius has a quote, "you can tell the condition, "of a man's kingdom, "by the state in which you find the dance there." Irish dance, was born out of oppression. It's such evolved form of expression. We were colonised for 800 years, that's bound to make a mark on how we dance. And how we see ourselves as dancers. People respond to oppression by resisting it. People were determined not to be swallowed whole. The Irish have developed a style of dance that is so intricate. The fastest footwork of all the folk dances in the world But passion is the heart of it, it's not only dancing to music but, dancing as music. It's something that's deeply human. I've always been awed by the beauty and the sheer joy of being alive, coming out in motions, Irish dance has been hugely influential. It has become part of global popular culture. A lot of the best Irish dancers, are no longer from Ireland. They're from Australia, North America or Canada and they can take Irish dance to a new place. The big question is, how and why the traditional dance of the Irish people has grown to become a world wide phenomenon. We have to think about why the dance was happening, the way it was happening, who the people are that made the dance at that time. What the social structures were at that time, what the political structures were at that time. That all feeds into Irish dance. Dance won't be captured, it flies free. My name is Morgan, Morgan Bullock. I'm a school teacher in America and, an Irish dancer. For me, dancing is something that I do almost naturally. It does just give me a sense of freedom. Some people ask, how come seeing as I'm not Irish, I choose to dance in the Irish style? Well, the answer to that question begins a long time ago, in Ireland's ancient history. You really want to go a long way back, our only real knowledge of dance in Ireland comes through the musical instruments, which survived. And our oldest musical instrument, is a set of melody pipes from Wicklow. The tuning is so good on them, that you can play a modern dance tune. The original set of melody pipes, were carbon dated at 4,150 years old. They're over 3,000 years older than anything else like them. We're terribly lucky to have the Vespasian Salter, which is a book of Psalms, from approximately 720 AD. In that book, there's an illumination of a group of musicians, and dancers. They're doing a sort of a two-step, and at the same time, they're clapping their hands. And to me it's particularly interesting because, the nicest tempo that I can find to do that, is a 110 beats per minute. I'll show you. We haven't changed much in 4 or 5 thousand years. I have no doubt, people jumped around and had exactly the same fun, as they do now. The instruments are all very complex, very beautifully made, and they want to be played, with a lively skip to them. Music and dance, is and has been probably throughout all of our culture, a very important thing in Ireland. Dance is so ephemermal, it just hasn't left the same mark on the landscape as other forms of settlement have over the past few thousands of years. But one thing that I think we can say with some confidence, is that Irish people did perform, ritual dances. "The god Lugh supports the Earth, "the sun and the moon. "His posturing involves circular movements, "and a special use of the feet." Dance was something which was very much to the fore to mark the important days of the year. St. Brigid's Day and Bealtaine and Midsummer, and Lughnasa. These were all days when people were celebrating a change of season. This is that time of the year, when all the animals that have been brought up to the higher region, or pasture during the summer, when they're being brought back, into the closer lands for the winter, this is when people are out, singing or dancing, and having a great time. There are very few records of dancing from the ancient Gaelic era. But encoded in the Irish language, there are a few clues about how people may have danced long ago. Two different words for 'dancing' in Irish, both Rince and Damhsa, neither of which are actually native Irish terms. Both came originally from old French, and presumably passed into Ireland through Middle English. They can be used to refer to frolicking or gambolling, frisking. Lambs ag rince. We have words like Leimneach, Opaireacht, Cleasaigheacht. They certainly communicate a sense of freedom, the freedom of movement, and a sense of enjoyment. Many of the ancient tales, do have references to heroes who were ag leimnacht or displaying their sporting prowess, or their agility, or athleticism. We see this in some of the stories that refer to Cu Chulainn, or to Fionn Mac Chuaill. Folk tales often begin with this phrase, 'this is how you should spend your day'. Spend a third of your day eating and drinking, a third of your day with music and dancing, and you should spend the last third of your day sleeping. Dance is a universal language, just like music. Everyone experiences the rhythm, in some kind of way, shape or form. Your heart beat has a rhythm. It is our primordial mother tongue. Psychologists talk about it as a state of flow, an altered state of the mind. It might connect to sort of the shamanic, ecstatic religious sort of voodoo. You are on a high, your endorphins are going, and you're disconnected with other people and it's a state of bliss. We begin to bounce in our mothers' wombs, we respond to rhythm, and sound and pulse, and heartbeat. We leap to our feet as soon as we can, we bobble and wiggle and wobble. You do it because it's in you, you can't really keep it out. Look at the courtship patterns of birds and the elaborate dancing of animals and mating rituals. Mating, sex, that's all part of it too. Dance is a fundamental human expression. It could be THE fundamental human expression... ...before language. It's a way of people coming together and showing community, and there's a sort of form of evolutionary adaptational advantage, to people or communities that dance. It means that you're looking after and attending to the group. We also dance to connect to our soul, we dance because the planets dance, we dance because the Earth turns round, we dance because our spirit flies, we cannot not dance. If you listen to the old Gaelic songs, they have these rhythms. Where did these rhythms come from? I think traces exist in the music, and in the history but for example, the old Irish clan march, which is not a dance, but it kind of was a dance. They were jigs. In fact, you can't say they're jigs a such, but they work in a kind of a triple time. 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3. That's an incredible rhythm to me, it's kind of very energising. You could kind of imagine them going to battle... boom! Boom, boom. They would have been marching to the sound of the pipes. The tactic was to kill the pipers first because, that would cut the heart out of the Irish Army, if you could stop the thrilling sound of the pipe march. It was around this time, about 400 years ago, that we began to get the first written accounts of what Irish dance might have actually looked like. One of the most extraordinary dances that was recorded, was called 'The Rince Fada', 'The Long Dance'. It's known that in the procession to or from the Battle of the Boyne, that Kings James the Second's entourage, was preceded by people dancing the Rince Fada and strewing flowers. One English lord was so impressed when he saw Rince Fada, that he wrote to Queen Elizabeth the First about the dance. "They're very, beautiful, magnificently dressed and first class dancers." The Rince Fada was a long line of dancers, meeting and dividing and, maybe changing places and back to place. Everyone joined in a line, and that of course is a form that is found all over Europe. It's sometimes called the 'Cagole', or the 'Carole'. The first pair turn, so that you get a column, and then you get the chance of more complicated manoeuvres. The couple move forward, and then the first pair, castaway, and everybody else follows them. Some of the earliest accounts that we have about Irish dance, were actually written by British visitors. There was a perception of something different about the Irish. More interesting, more vibrant, more... charming. They dance passionately. "We frog blooded English dance as if the practice were not congenial to us, "but here they moved as if dancing had been the business of their lives!" The male dancer with his arm above his head, waving and... the woman dancing with her hands akimbo. There wouldn't have been prescriptions as to how, you held your arms. You weren't dancing to a rigid pattern of behaviour, prescribed by church, state, or anybody else. People were free to be themselves. We danced with a lot more abandon. We were probably less self conscious. I think it was more like the Garden of Eden before the apple and the serpent. Subtitles The dancer drives the tune. If the dancer doesn't come down on that beat, there's no driving. I would tend to learn the tune and embody the tune so that I have the tune inside of me. Then I let the head go and let the feet take over. I tune in to the musician and the musician tunes into my steps, so we meet somewhere in the present moment, listening to each other. In Irish music when they talk about rhythm, what they're really talking about is the internal rhythm of the diddle-diddle... So when we say that musician has great rhythm, it's a perfect taca-taca-taca... A perfect clock-lock rhythm. You can't be too slow because when you're dancing there's gravity. You want the tempo of the music to be where when you lift off you're going to land on the beat. When I dance, I'm someplace else. I go off to this place and I don't see anything. It's like I'm tuned in to a different frequency and then I transport my body into that different frequency. I'm dancing. It's an expression of freedom and it's such a lovely place to be. That performance even if I say so about myself you can hear the feet beating out the tune. De-de-de-de-de... Each beat on the music. We had developed a style of dance that is so intricate with the beating. The percussive dancing. Percussive steps are the heart of Irish dance. But where did this foot battering style come from? Did the Irish invent it? Or did they absorb it from far away? RHYTHMIC DRUMMING) I look at Irish dancing and it definitely looks more like African dance to me. Percussion is the heart of it. It is one of those forms that is both music and dance. It's not only dancing to music but dancing as music. That's very common around the world. Whether that's Flamenco in Spain or Kathak in India. If you look at a map, you see there's a straight line going down from Ireland to north-western Spain, Galicia, Portugal, West Africa. The Spaniards traded with the Irish through west Ireland and also with the Africans and the Arabs. Personally I think that's where you find that connection. "Is his dance the precursor of Flamenco?" "Even the remote ancestor of Connemara dancing?" That's the thing with dance. You carry it in your body, so if your body moves, the dance form moves with it. "Even this Connemara dancing could be explained away as being related to Flamenco." "In Connemara it's called the battering." In Connemara, Galway and Mayo, the freestyle foot battering became known as sean-nos which simply means 'old style'. Subtitles Now we'll go on with the next hornpipe step. Go. There's a family of dance in the world. English dancing, Scottish dancing, Welsh dancing, Irish dancing. They have a germ of similarity. The sound of the dancer's feet. It's been a bit lost in England and Scotland but it was there at the beginning of the 20th century. Stop. That will be all for tonight. The thing is that the Irish have managed to make something quite prominent out of their step dancing. It has an intrinsic spectacle about it. The hard drumming of the feet and the swiftness of it. And that is really special for Ireland. What's important to understand is the floor in a lot of old cottages was made of mud. So you couldn't hear the sound of the dancer's feet. They used to take the door off the hinges and put the door down on the floor and they would jump up on the door and dance. If we were dancing on a flagstone floor or even the stones you won't hear it as strong compared to here. And when you have that sound and there's a musician playing for you, that sound really drives the music on, which in turn drives the dancer on as well. Traditional Irish dance gathering were often in the kitchen. So the dancing that was valued in that space was very physically constrained. You didn't have a huge space so the dancer considered good was the one that could dance on a sixpence. You danced in place. They danced on doors, barrels, on the table. Not just for sound but possibly for the craic and to challenge themselves. There's one story of the door being put on the top of a chimney and the dancer dancing on top of that. A-hey! She's rocking. You were nearly dancing yourself! "On the patron day in most parishes, the more ordinary sort of people meet and dance for the cake. The dances that hold the longest win the cake." Of course any time you have roosters together of any culture, you have competition. You have stamping and spitting and one-upping and strutting. We see this throughout Irish history, this sense of competition, proving your athletic prowessness, proving that you are the most successful, strongest, able person.... man! It absolutely parallels what happens in the wild. Who's going to be the alpha male. I think at the heart of Irish dancing is a one-upmanship. It is about distinguishing yourself from others. The whole engine of innovation is competition. Trying to do better than the other guy. The challenge in Irish dance is at the heart of the form. In 1649 during the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell leads his army into Ireland, to suppress the Irish Catholic Confederacy. Cromwell's army lays waste to Ireland, ushering in an unprecedented dispossession, land confiscation and the forced resettlement of the Irish. "We are here to carry on the great work against the barbarous and bloodthirsty Irish." Cromwell is probably the most hated man within Ireland. He comes to Ireland for some very strategic reasons. He wanted to make Ireland English. Trying to bring English people in and bring Ireland under the control of England. There are very memorable sieges where there are massacres of people. Between 1649 and '53, 600,000 people were killed or they died of disease or they leave Ireland. And that's out of a population of around 1.5 million. That's a 40 percent decline in a handful of years. Cromwell basically rounds up a lot of people as indentured labourers and sends them off to the West Indies. Indentured servitude is a time limited version of slavery. You get 'em to sign a contract which says I'm your slave for usually 7 years. Then you work 'em like dogs while you have them for those 7 years. There were many hundreds of thousands of Irish indentured servants. The 17th century also witnesses the mass enslavement of Africans. Between the 17th and the 19th century, millions of Africans were sold or born into chattel slavery across North American and the Caribbean. People for their own reasons these days often call the Irish and African experience similar. Well we weren't. The big difference between indentureship and chattel slavery is that under chattel slavery, the body and progeny and owned completely by the slave master. Even in indefinite indentureship only the labour of the person is owned, not the body and certainly not the progeny. That's a huge difference. It's a fundamental difference that has to be stressed. Literally beside the African slaves in those plantations were Irish indentured servants and overseers. These became the cornerstones of the plantation economy in sugar, cotton and tobacco. Both enslaved people and indentured Irish servants would work all day and then dance all night. Dancing around the campfires. When you're all kind of down here, being pushed down, then the energy goes this way. 'Cause it can't go up. In America, Africans and Irish continued to work side by side, often on the toughest jobs. We took over a lot of jobs and sometimes shared a lot of jobs with African-Americans. Anywhere there was construction going on, Irish and African-Americans met. Oppressed, suppressed, depressed, compressed people blended. What came out of that blend is something miraculous. I'm from the Zambezi Valley, southern Africa, Zimbabwe. I'm from Limerick City and I now live in County Clare. I'd never met you before. No. And we had kind of a... ...we didn't even practise anything. So that's the beauty of dancing. We found similar steps that we do. There was a time when you did a Clare step and I said, my grandfather used to do that! It happened a lot along the waterways and it was on ships, on boats. It was in labour camps, on the railroads. It was all these places. So what did they see in each other? It wasn't just that they were at the bottom of the totem pole. Both people share the notion of Diaspora. Both hear the drums and melody of the place they left mixing with the place that they arrive in. You can forge a bridge over anything. But it's so much easier when there's already recognition. And I think that was just going on all over the place. Of course there was shared culture. People were looking at one another all the time, copying, imitating one another. They're sharing rhythm and poly rhythm. 4/4, 6/8 time. The other is contributing polyrhythm, the overlaying of rhythms within a metre of music. The dragging of the beat from one metre of music to the next is the first emergence of a strange and wonderful crossover between Blacks and Irish. A new way of dancing was born in those work camps which would one day develop into one of the most famous dances in the world. But meanwhile in Ireland, things were going from bad to worse for most of those bottom classes. The 17th and 18th centuries were particularly challenging for most of the population of Ireland. The Irish rebelled and tried to resist but the Crown was determined to pacify Ireland through force and law. The Penal Laws were a series of discriminatory laws introduced from 1649 to '53 and thereafter, right through into the 18th century. It meant that Catholics couldn't vote. They didn't have a right to public office, they weren't allowed to worship, they didn't have a right to education. The British project was to eliminate Irish culture. You can take everything from people. You can take their possessions, their livelihood, you can try to strip their culture or whatever, but you can't take away their body. And that's why singing, storytelling, dancing have always been central especially to subjugated or relatively impoverished cultures. "Dancing is very general among the poor people. Almost universal in every cabin. Dancing masters of their own rank travel through the country from cabin to cabin. It's an almost absolute system of education." In the 1700s, dancing masters became an important part of the Irish cultural scene. Some taught in the grand houses of the rich. But there were others, iterant masters, mostly very poor, who went from village to village teaching dance. I suppose they were trying to strengthen the Irish culture. The arrival of the dancing master was a major event particularly in small rural areas. It was an occasion of great celebration, a huge social event for the people in the region. When the dance master came to town, they were held in high esteem. The clergy, the teacher, the doctor and the dance master. They were all held in the same way so they were very important. And these itinerant dancing masters cultivate step-dance as we know it today. Without these dance masters, a lot of the steps and tradition would have been lost because it was their responsibility to travel around and make sure that it was passed to the next generation. A good dance master would tell you how to stand, would tell you how to hold your back straight, would tell you to put your shoulders back, would give you a good stance and poise. The dancing masters were the ones who codified a lot of Irish dance and standardised it. They are the ones that made it erect and this whole idea of not using the arms. There are stories of them putting stones in their student's hands to keep them down. Irish dancing can be seen as a dance of resistance. And not just resisting a stereotype that the English might have put on the Irish as a people and a nation of people who ungovernable, who are unruly. I think that the resistance is also in the dancer really working with these two divided halves of the body. This tension. There's a pride in that. The names of some of these old dancing masters are still remembered. One whose influence continues to be felt was O Ceirnin from north County Kerry. O Ceirnin would have been teaching at the end of the 18th century. 1775-1780, around that time. O Ceirnin passed his steps on to a master called Thomas 'Muirin' Moore. Muirin was born in 1826 and also came from North Kerry. He took those steps and invented a few more including one called the Blackbird. This traditional dance is today danced by almost ever dancer in the world. Ireland wouldn't be the only country in the world that has been colonised and that's bound to make a mark on the dance. Dance is that form of expressing yourself and literally lifting yourself out of the mire of the ordinary and escaping into some other space. Dance at its best is the ultimate freedom. Subtitles in America, a different evolution was underway. 200 year ago, America was a tough place for all those immigrants and former slaves, who crowded into the slums of the big east coast cities, often in difficult circumstances. You gotta remember at that time, the Irish and the Africans, they weren't friends. You know, the Irish were definitely opposed to the Africans because of the way they were taking the jobs. So it wasn't a necessarily friendly relationship. This was the time when the minstrel shows began. White men blacked their faces and performed on stage. Often side by side with the African Americans they were mimicking. Irish Americans were always involved minstrelsy. From the very start, and they blacked up. Minstrels shows are racist, absolutely, absolutely. But you gotta understand that, you know, at that time, what was it? Racism was profitable. You gotta remember what the minstrel show was, it was an imitation of the African slave. And all lot of those were Irish performers, who could imitate the African slave the best because they had already had some relationships with the Africans. So as before, when the dance was mainly about interchanging cultures, it's about telling stories, now it's become, "Okay this is actually a way for me to live." It became about what money you can get, and how you can advance yourself in this new country. In the 19th century, we find Irish and African Americans dancing off against each other in the bars and on the street. What these people were doing is undoubtedly influenced by Irish dance. It's called jig, so it's some kind of local adaptation of dances that had been brought by the people who are here, and people who are here are coming from Ireland. They're also from African Diaspora. When we talk about the Irish style of dancing in the middle of the 19th century, the first move might be a jump into the sky. Whereas the first move in African dance was to shuffle down, bend the knees, and go down into the earth. In Ireland, I'm dancing here. And if you move, it's wrong. In Africa, I'm dancing here, and if you don't move it's wrong. So you get these tow people who meet each other and are like, "You're doing it all wrong. But I kinda like what you're doing." And, "I would never do that, but do that again." Money could be made from dancing on stage, or in face off competitions. Always the game was to show off, to be king of the dance. "A match has been made between John Diamond and Master Juba by some of the sporting community. The stake is large, ? nd an unparalleled display will be the result." The contest that we love to talk about the most is the contest between William Henry Lane, who was called Master Juba, and John Diamond. John Diamond was an Irishman. He was the leading Irish contest dancer on the P.T. Barnum circuit. He was a white man, but he was famous as the king of the negro dancers because what he did was dance in blackface. That was his specialty. William Henry Lane was a free black man. The first records of Lane are of him dancing in Irish pubs for coins at age 15. Now a young black boy dancing in an Irish pub at age 15 better dance his as off, or he wouldn't make it out the front door. So Juba had to be pretty good. "Single shuffle, double shuffle, cut across, spinning about on his toes and heels - in what walk of life, or dance of life does man ever get such stimulating applause as thunders about him?" The dance off prize fight that the great showman P.T. Barnum staged in 1843, between Master Juba and Master John Diamond was a major event. They were each supposed to dance 16 dances inside the competition. That's a lot of energy, that's a lot of dancing. A lot of pounding, a lot of gyrating, a lot of jumping, a lot of twisting, a lot of contortions. It was a free-for-all. And it was brilliant. I'm a tap dance historian and I think of it all as proto tap. There are many names for it - jig dancing, break down. On the first day, Diamond wins. Hands down. But on the second and third day, Juba overcomes him and what are called the conundrum dances. Dancing on glasses. Dancing with a glass of water on your head. Dancing while you jumped on either side of a rope. And Juba won the title King of All Dances. Diamond called himself authentic, and Juba called himself genuine. Each embraced this amalgamation between blacks and Irish. They, to me, are the great great grandparents of what we call tap dancing now. If you look at the origins and the history of tap, I can't say there's nothing Irish about it. What becomes complicated, especially with African Americans just because so many times, over and over again, things have been taken. And even when we do create things, history has been written to say that we were apart of it, or we didn't create it. And so sometimes it can be hard to watch someone doing something that you know is part of your culture. And you being written out of its history. This is not an idle fear. There's a long history of whites taking credit for black innovation. In fact, whites imitating blacks and taking credit for it is American culture. From minstrelsy, through jazz, through rock and roll, through hip-hop. I mean, it happens over, and over, and over again. I have gone looking for the edge of where it cases to be African, and begins to be Irish. The upward movement Bill Robinson, Bo Jangles, is like Fred Astaire. They both dance in the Irish style of the weightless upright body. Tap dance is a new form that emerged out of the concurrence, collision and competition between Blacks and Irish. All art is assimilation, all music is assimilation, all dance is assimilation. The famine effected rural areas disproportionately. How many dancers, and singers and musicians died? How much music did we lose? How many steps did we lose? After the famine, there's that remarkable that change that Irish culture kind of shakes itself. Kind of says, "Okay, we've got to get up off the canvas here, we've been absolutely flattened." The Gaelic League organised dances and ceilis to bring people together. Irish dance became iconic of Ireland. Almost an embodiment of Ireland. In Irish America, dance was really important. Because it displayed Irishness. The Irish American presence in Vaudeville, Broadway, Hollywood is very strong. Can anybody ever forget Michael Flatley strutting his stuff like a peacock. It's not only a rapture from the rules, but it can also be seen as a recapturing of parts of the tradition that have been forgotten. Dance is important because it's non-verbal communication. It can be decoded. What does the dance tell us about the culture, about the people. Dance gives us the lens. Irish dance has developed over centuries. Long ago, it may have had a wilder, freer energy, but as Ireland was colonised by the British, our style became more constrained. We learned to dance in confined spaces and we began to focus on the skills of our feet. You'd find itinerant dancing masters going from cabin to cabin, nurturing the dance and sustaining the culture. Many of the steps they danced are still danced today. 'Irish immigrants brought their dance with them.' 'In America, some lived and worked alongside African-Americans and they influenced each other.' 'One of the outcomes of that fusion was tap.' Irish dance is a form of freedom because the body allows you to express yourself even in conditions of great poverty or oppression. And dance is that form of expression and literally almost lifting yourself out of the mire of the ordinary and escaping into some other space. And dance at its best is the ultimate freedom. 'So fond are the Irish of music that in some form or other, they must and will have it.' 'In spite of oppression, they laugh and sing, free as the mountain air.' Asenath Nicholson says when she came to Ireland that she had a pain in her head from all the talk. That everywhere you went there was people talking, there were people singing, there were people dancing. By the mid 19th-century, Ireland's population had reached eight million and was growing fast. So at the very period when Irish people were poorest, there were more and more people spreading into areas that had never even been settled. And Asenath Nicholson also says the little children, they were surrounded so much by the music, could dance before they could run. The famine was a watershed in Irish history. It originated from the blight which arrived which in Ireland in 1845. There was a great dependency upon the potato from those who were very poor, and this was a repeated failure, year after year after year. The scale of the Famine was compounded by British mismanagement. Belief in laissez-faire economics and divine providence ensured that the government intervention was kept to a minimum. Britain was probably the richest country in the world, but ideology meant that Irish subjects were largely left to fend for themselves. "It was no man's business to provide for another." The Famine leaves one million dead, and over two million people emigrate within a decade. Three million people disappeared, almost overnight. After the Famine, the population collapses. We're the only country in Europe which has lost population since the 19th century, the only one. The Famine affected rural areas disproportionately due to the subsistence way of living. So, unfortunately, many of those communities that were most affected by the Famine were Gaelic-speaking communities. The Famine was sometimes called the Great Silence. This noisy, talkative, vigorously active culture, that's the one that the Famine wipes away. How many dancers and singers and musicians died at that time? How many songs did we lose? How many steps did we lose? How much music did we lose? There's a huge amount of our culture that we did lose at the time. But then the brighter side is, "OK, what survived it?" And the likes of Muirin survived the Famine, brought something out of the Famine like that, and was able to pass it on to the next generation again. And without people like him, we could have lost way more and who knows what kind of a situation we'd be in today? Thomas "Muirin" Moore died in the 1870s in poverty in a workhouse. Before he died, he passed his steps to another North Kerry master named Ned Bad Welsh. Welsh then passed his steps on to a man called Jeremiah "Munnix" Molyneaux. Munnix was the last of the itinerant masters and his steps can actually be traced to people who are teaching and dancing all over the world. Jimmy Hickey was my original dance teacher. Jimmy would have taught me at the age of probably five or six. Jimmy was taught by Liam Dineen, and Liam Dineen was taught by Jerry Munnix. The Blackbird you showed me? Yeah? That's a Munnix step, is it? That's Jerry's Blackbird. Yeah, and that came from Jerry... ...to himself. To Liam, to you? Like that. And that's as close as we get to a Munnix Blackbird as we know? Jerry's Blackbird. Yeah. "We foot it all the night, weaving olden dances, mingling hands and mingling glances till the moon has taken flight." After the Famine there's that remarkable change in the late 19th century that Irish culture kind of shakes itself. "OK, we've got to get up off the canvas here." "We've been absolutely flattened, but if we don't get up, if we don't take responsibility for ourselves, this is over." In the late 19th century, cultural revivalists establish organisations like the Gaelic Athletic Association and the Gaelic League, and in the words of Douglas Hyde, these aimed to de-anglicise Ireland and to reinvent Irish culture. The Gaelic League organised social and cultural events. These ranged from literary talks on Irish literature, historical talks, and also dances and ceilidhs, which provided a social platform to bring people together. Irish dance became iconic of Ireland, almost an embodiment of Ireland. The first ever Gaelic League ceilidh was held in London in 1897. And from then on they became hugely popular throughout Ireland, England and America. But from the start, there was controversy over what dances were pure or authentically Irish. "Those dances are brazen impostors, and a disgrace to the Gaelic League." They were looking at the set dances that they performed at the ceilidh. And some people said, "They're not even Irish!" They were questioning, "Well, what is Irish dance?" So let's ask ourselves, what is Irish? That was a huge debate. What that does then is put enormous pressure on the dancing movement to get rid of anything that smacked of fripperies from France, especially anything that smacked of Englishness. "We have the foreign dances simply because we were half slaves, and these were the things danced by our masters." They were saying, "But they came from France." "They're the quadrilles or the sets." The head must be erect. The shoulders held back. People always want to know what the latest fashionable dances are, and they can see and copy. Quadrilles came into Ireland through the upper and middle classes and then... picked up in turn by other lower social classes. In London, you had the King of England doing quadrilles in the court with a quadrille orchestra. And how they danced was totally different to how they were danced in rural Ireland. In rural Ireland they were dancing to polkas and they were dancing to slides and dancing to reels and horn pipes. They were not originally Irish. They were Irish-ed. If you've not got the money for a large space, you use your kitchen to dance in. You use your barn. You use the crossroads. What happens then is that the quadrille square set becomes a little bit more compressed and neat and tidy. So, it does become an Irish dance. Ho! But no, the Gaelic League felt the roots of it came from France. And it wasn't enough that the Irish people had made it their own, it was decided that it was foreign, so it shouldn't be allowed to be danced at future ceilidhs. The Gaelic League came out with this philosophy, "From now on, at our ceilidhs, you are not doing the quadrilles." Why are you not doing them? "Oh, they were brought in by the British soldiers." And they banned them. Ho! Hup! And it was such a shame because the sets had meant so much to the people in these rural areas of Ireland. Ho! Although the Gaelic League was originally founded as a non-sectarian and apolitical organisation, we know that many members became more politicised in it. At the Gaelic League's ceilidhs and feiseanna, ideas would have been discussed. Ideas to do with rebellion. Ideas to do with resistance. So for people like Padraig Pearse, Eoin MacNeill, Gaelic League events and activities brought them into contact with others who were more in favour of a militant form of nationalism to rid Ireland of British influence. There were reports of rebels dancing in British prisons, and in prisons in Ireland like Kilmainham Gaol. In the gaols, they did dance, both as a way of keeping physically fit but also as a way of kind of saying, "You're not cowing us." Or, "You're not bullying us." Dance now becomes an expression of nationalism now, but also with that very rigid body posture. People respond to oppression by resisting. If you look at the ambition of the Gaelic League to instil a sense of pride in our culture, are you going to present something that isn't other than what the Irish dancing body is presenting, which is absolute control? It's a kind of a martial stance. It's an expression of pride. This rediscovering of what it meant to be Irish is completely crucial to the transformation of Irish politics in the decades that were to come. It started off with the Home Rule campaigns from the 1880s, but then it accelerated into something much more significant. After the Easter Rising of 1916, this turned into a mass movement for independence from Ireland, which of course results in the Treaty of 1921 and the creation of Ireland, the 26-county entity that exists today. Because by 1921, Ireland had gained independence from Britain. When a visiting dignitary rolled into town, in the early years after the foundation of the state, the three things they could probably be guaranteed were the national anthem, a benediction, and a nice performance by some Irish dancers. 'What can be more pleasing to the eye than the dancing of lasses and lads?' 'For there we have the beauty of the perfect step.' The Gaelic League sets up a new organisation in 1930 called An Coimisiun le Rinci Gaelacha to oversee and further the development of Irish dance. An Coimisiun is the governing body of Irish step dancing globally. It was set up as a committee to basically regulate Irish dancing. They set up rules and regulations in relation to feiseanna and oireachtas, which would have been the competitions in Irish dance. Out of that came the interminable and incessant desire for medals and competition. The young Irish dancers looked like superannuated Prussian field marshals with hundreds of medals clanking on their chests. It became the raison d'etre of the dancing schools, winning competitions. Dance became much more an expression, not so much of joy, but of technical accomplishment. Can you do these steps? Can you dance to a time? And it becomes competitive, where you're being marked. The notion of time and step and execution of step and posture, all could be measured. Aon, dha, tri. Aon, dha, tri. Aon, dha, tri. This made it more feasible for adjudication purposes. How straight are you? Are you in time to the music? Are you not in time to the music? Aon, dha, tri. Coig, sia, seachd. Aon, dha, tri. Aon, dha, tri. The Coimisiun, it was wonderful how they revived, revived Irish dancing, because if they didn't revive it, I don't know where it would be today. But in reviving it, they selected particular dances. You know, it was the Munster style of dance that was cultivated. And they omitted, excluded other dance styles. Irish dancing as we know was an invented tradition, to a certain extent, by An Coimisiun and the Gaelic League. It codified the form, it moulded the form into being. The Irish dance teachers in the Gaelic League, they were anxious to portray a proper image of the Irish. So the dance masters told the dancers to keep their hands by their side, so it was reinforced in competition. We have no movement from the waist up, and all the movement and activity happens from the waist down. When I mention that, people find that fascinating. They've never thought about that. They've never wondered why Irish dancers keep their arms at their sides. And also crucially, you now begin to wear a special costume. The costumes portrayed their Irishness. There were certain symbols and things that you had on your costume, like we adopted the Tara brooch. And in the earlier days, the embroidery reflected, er, shamrocks and even leprechauns to some extent. Eileen Battersby brilliantly described the Irish dance uniform as looking as if they'd been bespattered with the Book of Kells. . 'The annual procession of the Eucharist.' 'Almost the entire Catholic population is marshalled to join in this public act of homage to the King of Kings.' Another facet of the rise in cultural nationalism was the growth in a strict moral code. And we see this reflected in the influence of the Catholic Church on appropriate public activities for young males and females. "The dances are unmistakable incitements to evil thought and evil desires." Dance was seen as an occasion of sin and the agents of The Wicked One would come along and mingle amongst the dancers. "Dancing halls have brought many a good, innocent girl into sin, shame and scandal, and set her unwary feet on the road that leads to perdition." The next thing you know, is that the dances the clergy favoured most were the safe ceilidh dances and the pure competition style of An Coimisiun. Ceilidhs were very much controlled by the local priest, men on the one side of the room, women on the other side. And everybody would be watching. It was George Bernard Shaw, at least it's accredited to him, who said that dancing was a vertical expression of a horizontal desire. Now, in Ireland there was going to be none of that. You didn't hold somebody closely. It was hand across the body. You know, the hand would separate you. The hand would always separate you. You could swing like this, or you could swing like that. Holding the hand, but you didn't get too close. As they used to say, I think in Irish America, when kids were dancing in high schools, "Leave room for the Holy Spirit!" The straight-backed posture seems to me anti-sensual. No funny business going on here. It also splits the body into the top half, which is rigid, and then the bottom half, and pay no attention to this part in between. That does tie together, I think, with this church and state control of women, of premarital sex, of contraception, divorce, and many other social issues. It's like as if it was another planet. But no, it wasn't. This was real. Aon, dha, tri, ceithir. For centuries, the traditional spaces people used to dance were the crossroads and in people's private homes. Traditional Irish dance gatherings were often in the kitchen. "Round the house and mind the dresser." You know, so your body wouldn't hit the dresser and knock off the good crockery or whatever. Mam was dancing... I'd say old-style step dancing really, isn't it? All the modern Irish dancing you'd see now has evolved from that. It's what you do with your feet as you're moving around the set, the toes and the heels, and, you know, battering down around those parts it can be quite intricate. They're putting a lot into it but it's so rhythmical, so musical. I think that probably goes way back and it's all connected between step dancing and shuffling and Sean-nos dancing and set dancing. Like, the lines are, are blurry where one stops and the other one starts. We seemed to get it from older people, you know? You'd watch, and you'd hear. You have to be dancing with the person too, because you feel the energy in that person. You can't learn from a book. You have to be dancing with the person to really get the dancing into your feet. Whoo! In 1935, the Irish state, under pressure from the church, introduces a new law which effectively brings dancing in private homes and crossroads to an end. The Free State government imposed a Dance Hall Act in 1935 which sought to regulate, and in some ways control, the gatherings of people to engage in dancing. What the Act does is effectively makes dancing in people's private homes or at the crossroads illegal. It got very, very weak. There was definitely a big fear that the way the sets were being danced was going to be lost. This beautiful tradition, that was going to be lost. People who were running dances in their house, they were prosecuted. It had terribly deleterious effects, erm, on rural life. It's crazy, isn't it, to think back that they had such influence on how our dancing is done today. Like, my grandparents always spoke about playing music and dancing at each other's houses. That's how my family learned how to dance, passing it on from one generation to the next. So when the 1935 Dance Hall Act came in and it was illegal to do that in your own house or at the crossroads or wherever it may be, essentially a way of life was completely stopped. All around Ireland there were stories of priests raiding private houses and crossroads dances. "Wooden roadside platforms were set on fire by curates." "The priests drove their cars backward and forwards over the timber platforms." "Concertinas were sent flying into the streams, and those who played music at the dances were branded as outcasts.' We see first-hand accounts from the 1960s, even as late as the 1970s, of the parish priests coming into a dance hall and literally lifting the needle on a record player because he had seen a young man and woman dance too closely together. So all these factors led to a very repressed society in the mid 20th century in Ireland. I met so many people in my researches who were virtually in tears at what had been done, to the way of life that they valued so much. In reality, there are two wellsprings of Irish culture in the early 20th century. One is on the island of Ireland itself, but the other is a sprawling diaspora, and nowhere is this more evident than in the United States. There are about 40 million Americans who declare themselves to be of Irish descent. That's a lot more than is on our own little speck of an island. In America, Irish dance was on a very different path. It was becoming part of the mainstream. Dance was really important because it displayed Irishness, and the dance schools and the dance music is a really vigorous part of the culture. Many of the dance masters went out there because they found that they could make a living out of teaching Irish dancing. And they had a far better standard of life than we had, in America. Hence those people... Pat Roche from County Clare, Tom Hill, an enormous influence, James McKenna, they brought the Irish dancing with them. James McKenna and many other dance masters had been taught by Jeremiah "Munnix" Molyneaux. So his steps are connected to the dancing masters of North Kerry and the pre-Famine period. And this Munster style becomes the main style in America. Five and six, and seven... It was basically the Munster style that was danced in New York. It was called the McKenna style then but it was a faster-paced dancing, very, erm, solid, strong rhythm. Down to the floor, dig in as much as you can was kind of the idea of it, of his style of dancing. And then, some dance masters like Donny Golden combined the Munster style with the Ulster style which has a lighter step. It was more into the technique and the lifting and bringing yourself off the floor as you dance, you know, in a more stylish manner, instead of, like, pounding it out. So they wanted to take that... And they wanted to go... And, you know, and do it at that pace, and put fancier material in and fancier steps. I think Irish dancing masks a certain trauma for the Irish diaspora. It allows people to stay connected to their homeland and allows them to almost forget that they're not there. That they had to leave, not by choice, but by necessity. My mum started me out to keep some culture in the family and tie to the Irish roots. Since she moved to America, she wanted us to have a bit of Ireland in our home. Most of the people have emigrated through the years, so their history is, they really wanted to keep up the traditions of the past. In my case, my parents never did Irish dancing but they made sure we all did Irish dancing. Like it or not! Give yourselves a hand there. The Irish stick together in the United States. They work hard and they climb the socio-economic ladder. They rise in blue-collar jobs in the police force and in politics. They're grafters and they're networkers and many of them rise in the entertainment business, becoming Hollywood and Broadway stars. The Irish-American presence in Vaudeville, Broadway, Hollywood, is very strong. There are important figures who happen to be Irish-American like George Cohan, Gene Kelly and Jack Donahue. "In Boston, the kids didn't worry about what they were gonna be when they grew up." "You were either gonna be a dancer or a fighter." "A lot of these Irish-American dancers, they were hoofers." "Most had to graft and hustle to make their way to the top." Camera! I've read about Jimmy Cagney growing up on the Upper East Side of New York. And you proved you were a man by being able to duke it out and by being able to out-dance the next fella on the next block. That was Irish dancing in the Irish-American tradition. "I learned how to dance from learning how to fight." "It was feint, duck, quick dance around your opponent." "On your toes mostly, then shoot out the arm like a bullet!" Keep that camera going! In this culture, dance is a kind of sport. It's like boxing. Both of those are avenues of mobility. They are open to the Irish-American. The man who couldn't dance couldn't fight. And the man who couldn't fight couldn't dance. Great dancers like Cagney and like Gene Kelly, you put the fists up or you danced it out. I think that's pretty much gone from Irish dance now. Nobody expects you to put up the fists after, you know, winning the regional competition and prove that you're a man. The Irish have been dancing like this for many, many years. Head proudly held high, shoulders back, arms stiffly down at the sides. Their dancing is based completely on the movement of the legs and the sound of the feet. People want to know about Singin' In The Rain. He always said it was just a simple Irish clog dance that anyone can do. He had really studied Irish dancing. He was very proud of being Irish, and I think he felt a real identity with the dancing. You could say that one of the biggest drivers of change and evolution in Irish dance in the past 50 years was the setting up of the World Irish Dance Championships in 1970. In the 1950s, Irish dancing was very popular in Britain. And they'd travelled to Dublin to compete at the All-Ireland Championships. And, lo and behold, they actually beat the Irish. We realised, "Wow! There's this wealth of Irish dancing all over the world!" And we opened up the World Championships and found out how much of a wealth there was. Irish dancing had been moving around, of course, people emigrating, so there was Irish dancing in so many countries now. So, creating the World was bringing these people from these countries back to the homeland and back to their heritage and competing with it. It becomes more and more about the contest, speed, percussion. They're always looking for something to push out the boat a little bit more to get the adjudicator to look at me. Tiaras and headgear, everything. Everybody knows the dress of a young girl who is in an Irish jig competition. That skirt is designed to open like a bell, and everything about her, except for her curls, you know, their bob, their weave, is about keeping that geometry of form. It's a big, huge industry and the wigs are now a serious element. You cannot dance at any of those competitions unless you're wearing a wig. Now they have introduced rhinestones glittering from one end to the other. The philosophy is, anything that glitters will attract attention. It's not just about glitter and wigs. Competition has brought whole new levels of skill, dexterity and athleticism to Irish dance. People are so much more into fancy footwork and this twisting of the ankles, which is great. Where years ago, a few years back, it was the highest jumper who could lift the highest. And every time it changes to a different thing. It's a solo form and it is about distinguishing yourself from others. And I think of the fact that Irish dancers don't have the use of their upper body to leap into the air. They don't have the plie, a softening of the knees, to get higher into the air. So we're defying gravity, and we're resisting, doing things that we wouldn't be expected to do if we didn't have our hands at our sides. You have to be very well fit to keep pulling yourself out of the ground, and then look like it's nothing. The question comes up, especially when it comes to the competitive world, and it's very similar to diving, to gymnastics, to figure skating. They're very similar and they're all sports. The question is, is Irish dancing, when it comes to competition, is it a sport or is it an art? . 'We have the Bunclody Ceili Band here with a selection of reels.' Musicians were meant to be heard and not seen. They were meant to be in the corner, play the damn music, play it at a steady tempo, don't do anything too fancy. And the music was merely there to supply the rhythm and the tempo for dance. And it's really only in the 1960s that you get a major step forward in creativity in the music. The 1960s and '70s were a time of radical change for Irish traditional music. The era of the ceili band began to wane, and a new generation, deeply influenced by developments in America and Europe, arrived to shake things up. It was kind of a revolution. There's a modernisation of Irish society in the 1960s which drives profound cultural and generational change. We see a new, optimistic, idealistic generation of Irish people. And we see everything from free education and EEC membership, and the ups and downs of politics, the economy and society driving a wider cultural shift. And these are the things that start to filter into lyrics, into dance and into music. In this way, Irish people are processing a new Ireland through music. And they're articulating it with their fingers, with their fretboards and with their feet. What happened with Irish music was that there was a young group of people who started to play around with it. Certainly with people like Donal Lunny, Andy Irvine, Sweeney's Men, The Chieftains. Those musicians who began to play bouzoukis and mandolins, they invited a contrapuntal accompaniment of the tune. So it was that period that suddenly was explosive and it felt electric. Every generation throws up a phenomenon. It's just the way that art is. People emerge and astonish everyone. Michael Flatley bursts onto the scene in the 1970s, and he was the first Irish-American to win the Worlds and would soon become the first Irish dancer to become a global star. Michael Flatley is from Chicago, a working-class guy, who comes up in the competition realm. At one point, he won the Guinness World Record for 29 taps per second or something like that, reaching the limit of human possibility and then pushing that limit. I think Michael Flatley is absolutely part of this Irish-American tradition of pugilism and dance being connected, and dance being a competition, dance being a macho kind of thing. Actually, Michael did some boxing in his early life and he did connect the two. He was as light as a feather on the floor. The same way on the ring, he could move and fly. You started seeing him Moonwalk. You started seeing him doing all these different styles of dance with Irish dance and saying, "I'm going to be the best and the biggest in this culture and in this dance." Michael Flatley wasn't the only rising star in the Irish-American scene. In New York, Jean Butler was learning her steps from dance master Donny Golden. Swing two, three. Then swing two, three. Then swing to the back. Four, five, six, seven. When Jean even came to class as a beginner, she just had this... so erect look and so intent in class. Like, so serious to get everything exactly right, that I was like, "Wow, this kid has got something going for herself!" Soon as she walked on stage, you just kinda say, "This kid's gonna be good." In the 1970s I started the group The Green Fields Of America. I knew from the audience response that there was an appetite for it. And through Michael Flatley and then Donny Golden and Jean Butler, who were all part of our group at one point or another, the music and the dancing, certainly in my life, came together. It's important to note that it was the musical act that people came to see and they weren't expecting dancers. And when the dancer did come flying out from stage left, it was an enormous, energetic response, because something just happened that they weren't expecting. The idea was to come out there and shoot out there and, like, bring a rise to the middle of this tune and a lot of energy and perform out some great rhythms and do some fancy footwork and get the audience into awe. That was the goal. I understood that Irish dance did have the power that it had because of those experiences. It really forced me to figure out how I wanted to be on stage and figure out what I needed to do to be on stage. And by the end of my time, I wasn't wearing a traditional costume anymore. I was trying to dance in a very particular way. I was evolving as a performer as the performances were happening. 'Then, in 1994, a catalytic event occurs that will have a dramatic impact on Irish dance.' 'Ireland was by now enjoying a new-found confidence.' 'Producer Moya Doherty brings Michael Flatley and Jean Butler together with a troupe of award-winning competition dancers and composer Bill Whelan, to create the interval act for the Eurovision Song Contest.' 'And following its success, with director John McColgan, they go on to create the stage show Riverdance.' This show had the potential to be a world show, to have international application. And we both felt that we could take what was a basic folk dance, make it exciting, make it modern, and excite a modern audience. I grew up listening to Dave Brubeck. So, here's this guy Dave Brubeck playing jazz, but he's using mixed time signatures. So instead of four beats to the bar where you go, "One, two, three, four. Two, two, three, four. Three, two." Instead of that, you go, "One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five." So, the downbeat that we all kind of beat along to is happening somewhere a little bit odd. And when I did Riverdance, what I tried to do was to create attention by writing a piece which had six-eight and four-four together in honour of Irish music. Because Irish jigs are divided into threes. And reels, which are four-four. One, two, four. But I mixed the two and went... One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Ladies and gentlemen, Riverdance. Can anybody ever forget Michael Flatley coming on stage, strutting his stuff like a peacock? Absolutely sexualised male body, but incredible energy. He's bounding on the stage and he's not embarrassed. He might be embarrassing, but he's not embarrassed. I think that pride is really what the innovation was. That was what people responded to. Drawing on some of that American cockiness and combining it with his Irish heritage. That moment in Riverdance could not have happened with Irish-born dancers as the lead dancers. It had to have happened with Irish dancers in America because they had that long history of other percussive dance forms like tap dancing. The Irish have travelled to other cultures and there is a cross-fertilisation between Vaudeville tap, old-style American tap and Irish dance. There is a rhythm relationship in the music. When I saw her flying out on stage, you know, my heart raced and I got goosebumps and I got chills. I was so proud. I was thrilled to death. And then, of course, Jean Butler coming in, sexy, in black and whatever, and you've got an adult form of Irish dance. It was such a revelation because, as I say, it had been in some respects juvenilised and desexualised. Riverdance essentially put the sex back into Irish dancing. It's not only a rupture from the rules, but can also be seen as a recapturing of parts of the tradition that had been neglected or forgotten. I can't tell you the thrill for me dancing with these 30 Irish dancers. They're the best in the world. Michael Flatley certainly didn't come out of nowhere. He inherited a tradition that had gone on before him, and he ended up being an embodiment of that. We can trace the dance lineage from Muirin to Ned Bad Welsh to Jeremiah Molyneaux. He would have taught James McKenna who taught Pat Roche in New York, and then Pat Roach would have taught the Dennehys in Chicago, who taught Michael Flatley. So in some ways there's a lineage going from Michael Flatley all the way back to Muirin, the father of dance in North Kerry. And Jean Butler, she is also connected all the way back to Muirin through her teacher Donny Golden, whose own teacher, Jerry Mulvihill, was also taught by James McKenna. Of course, Riverdance wasn't the only show taking the world by storm. Shows like Feet Of Flames and Lord Of The Dance also reached audiences of millions. It's the culmination of hundreds of years of evolution. It didn't just drop out of the sky. All the countless musicians, singers and dancers who have gone before them went into creating those shows. Since the 1990s, Irish dance has exploded across the world in ways that would have been unfathomable before. Before then, Irish dance was just not cool. Now it is seen as a cutting-edge dance form. It came from the streets. It came from the crossroads. It came from the kitchens. It came from the houses. It's not something that you can put into a box. Everybody who does a freestyle dance, they've put a part of their own spirit and soul into it. It's an expression of freedom. All forms of Irish dance have seen a huge increase in popularity. Step dancing, Sean-nos, and the many regional styles of step dancing are all growing strong. Even crossroad dances are making a comeback. At Effrinagh Cross, every year the community comes together to continue a tradition that goes back centuries. Six or seven years ago, I organised a crossroads dance and there was like 300 people showed up. It was huge and we've just done it every year since. It's magic. Patrick Kavanagh said the spark of creativity strikes on memory and on understanding your tradition. And, you know, creativity isn't moving outside your tradition. It's bringing it on, literally taking the next few steps. And if you look at the dancing masters, they did pass on their style and their ethos that way. For a living culture, you've got to keep innovating. You've got to keep inventing. You've got to keep moving forward. It's about the music and giving the music a beat and rhythm and a lift. People are still doing that part of it. They're just changing it around and adding, doubling and tripling, and doing so many things with the rhythm and trying to do so many triple clicks and so many... you name it, these days. Irish dancing especially is something that is, you know, made to be shared. It's something that was born out of oppression and it's such a raw form of expression. There are people from so many different cultural backgrounds who are able to express themselves through Irish dancing and enjoy the fun and the love and the passion for Irish dancing. 'From ancient roots, Irish dance has grown and spread its branches over continents.' 'Today, Irish dance belongs to the world.' Lightnin' Hopkins, an American blues musician, says, "God approves of us when we work, but He smiles on us when we dance." This dance is a heaven-sent kind of thing. I don't think we need to take it apart to see how it ticks. I just we just need to love the fact that it ticks, you know, and that ticking sets our feet in motion.
