[baby crying] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [folk music] - Welcome to... [screaming] My name is Rain Dupree and this is my church, The Church of Truth. [clears throat] Excuse me, the historic Church of Truth. Rumor has it that Flip Wilson once came here on an Eastern Sunday, in the late 70's. Interesting, fun fact. [jazz music] And no. Even though I'm in this nice office and this comfy chair, I am not the pastor at this church, nor would I want to be, especially at this church. Not that there's anything wrong with this church. I mean, it is historic by the way. He's no longer the pastor here either. Our new pastor starts today. And some of us in the congragation are gonna meet with him to make sure we see eye to eye. We here at Church of Truth, don't exactly have the best track-record, when it comes to keeping pastors. - Pastor, I just wanted to know... [screaming] Pastor, I needed to talk to you about this... [screaming] Lord, I have to learn to knock. - I can go on and on about the scandals here at this church. Let me see, there was the financial one, the real estate one... Oh, and there was this huge one. But, there is a gag-order and I can't discuss it. Which brings us to our latest scandal. Our latest pastor, recently lost his mind. [screaming] He ran off with a 19 year old, former dancing-girl slash hoochie-mama, and started a church somewhere in El Paso. So, as you can imagine, things are pretty hot around here. And it's not because the thermostat's broken. - So you just gonna set the water right there next to the paperwork? You don't see that as an accident waiting to happen? - So, with this new pastor, a few of us have a plan to change things back to normal. If that's even possible. See, I love this church. And I'll do anything to make it better, even if I have to deal with her. Sister Maple Harris, not the oldest member of this church, by far. She's been here since I was little girl, and I've never seen the top of her head. And the hat she wears, is dangerous. She's definitely the bossiest. And probably the most-- - And the dip needs to be sealed. I keep telling you all to seal the dip every time. And I literally have to do it myself, every single meeting. So I guess now I'm gonna have to put away the snacks too. - No, no, I'll do it. - Oh, you will? - Yes, of course... [mumbling] - What did you say? - Of course, Sister Harris. - [Maple] Mm-hmm. Rain! - Yes, Sister Harris? - I don't see the agenda, in this stack. How are we supposed to have a meeting without an agenda, dear? See that's the whole reason why we're here. We need that agenda. - I was just about to print that out. - You know, when I was church secretary, I was on top of things like that. Because there's a certain protocol to running a meeting. - I'm gonna go get that agenda, okay? - [Maple] Mm-hmm, you do that. - She's an acquired taste. That agenda she's flipping her lid about, is not that actual agenda, they're talking-points, that she wants to go over with me before the meeting, to make sure I don't screw up, when we meet the pastor. She loves to micro-manage me. Rain do this, Rain do that! How dumb does she think I am? I love this church and will listen to any solution, if it means it would make us a church again. If that's even possible. Even if I have to spend a few hours on a Tuesday, with Sister Harris. But as for the plan, it's pretty simple. Come up with a unified agenda, and confront the pastor to uphold what we here at Church of Truth are all about. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not opposed to change. There is talk that he is gonna change everything, from who advises the church, all the way down to redesigning the church pamphlets. And I take offense to that. I designed the church pamphlet. [knocking] I love the... Hi, Felix. - Hey, am I the first one here? - Sister Harris is in the conference room. Why are you dressed like that? - [whispering] This? - [Rain] [whispering] Yes, that. You look like where in the world is Carmen Sandi-Negro. - Who in the world is that? - Never mind, take that off. It's 100 degrees in here. - Hey, Deacon Pride said to come discreet. So I thought I'd come incog-negro. - [Rain] Uh-huh. - That's cool, that's better for me. Oh, yeah that's more like it. What? - [Rain] Your fly is open. - It is. - That is Felix Bosier, the choir director. he has to be the first person in history to get rejected from [Beep] Idol. [Beep] Voice, So you think you can [Beep], [Beep] Got Talent, [Beep] Fear [Beep], Jeopardy and The [Beep], all in the same season. But you can't blame him for trying. - Okay, how do I look now? [blinging] - [Felix] Good Lord, it's hot in here. When we gonna get this AC fixed? - I called a guy, he should be here any minute. - Man I hope so. - I guess. - You guess? - [Vernon] Good morning, people. - Hey, Deacon Pride! - Oh my God, why is it so freaking hot in here? - I don't... - [Rain] How are you Deacon? - [Vernon] I'm not so good right now, Rain. - [Rain] It's not working. I have someone coming to look at it. - Oh, you have somebody coming? - I do. - Well, they're not here yet are they? - [Rain] But, but-- No, they are not. So you let Vernon Pride fix this thing. - I told her. - [Vernon] It takes soft hands like mine. - I tried to tell her. - You don't know what you're doing, you watch and take notes. - I told her. - Okay, make yourself useful. - [Felix] Thank you Deacon. - Deacon Vernon Pride, Senior Deacon of the church, and former city councilman, ninth district. He had to step down, after only three months, after Channel Seven News caught him parking in a handicap parking spot, during the Special Olympics opening ceremony. He denies it to this day. Even though he was caught on camera. - Well, just what I thought. It's broke. You get somebody here, right away to fix this thing. You hear me? - I'll get right on it. - Right away, pronto! - Pronto, I will get right on that Deacon. - Woo! - Alright, so where's everybody at, what's going on... Son? - [Felix] What, what? - Look at you, man, what is this? I mean you look like a 1980 retread Prince album cover. Why do you keep doing this to yourself? - I'm an entertainer, Deacon Pride. It's my job to come in here every Sunday morning, and entertain this congregation. And that's what I do. [snapping fingers] I do that. [snapping fingers] - That, you do. [snapping fingers] - Thank you. And I know you were being sarcastic. But that's okay, I'm gonna take that anyway. - I was not being sarcastic. - Oh, you were very much so, but that's okay, because I know what people say about me. - No one says anything about you. You're a great guy, it's the clothes on you, that we talk about. - If I had feelings, they'd be hurt by now. - [Rain] Ouch. - Okay, everybody can we get this thing going? - [Felix] Sure, sure. - Alright, look everybody, we have to be tight on our game. - [Rain] Deacon Pride? - And have a unified front - [Rain] Deacon Pride-- - against Pastor Owens. Not right now, okay? Because this guy is a real smooth talker, okay? He's gonna try to sneak in stuff. And we gotta be on top of our game. - But Deacon, I wanted-- - Not right now. So, what I did, I had Rain type up some notes. You got those notes, right? - [Rain] Mm-hmm. - Okay. We gotta follow those notes to a tee, just in case he tries to trip us up. We gotta be on top of our game. - Like a cheat-sheet! - Yeah, sort of like a cheat-sheet. But it ain't a cheat-sheet. - Not a cheat-sheet. - Okay? - Not a cheat-sheet, Rain. - Ain't no cheat-sheet, okay? Alright, so let's get this thing going. Where's Maple at? - She's in the conference room. She wants to meet in the conference room. - Maple is in the conference room? Why is she in the conference room? It's like a sauna in the conference room. - That's what I tried to say. - Sister Harris wants to do this in the conference room. - Oh, Sister Harris wants to do it in the conference room. So that makes all the difference in the world. Cause Sister Harris wants to do it in the conference room. We gonna do what Sister Harris says, right? No we aren't! - No we not. - I am the senior Deacon of this church! And what I say goes, is that clear? - Yeah, yeah. - [Rain] Yes. - [Vernon] You follow what I say, not her! - Not her. - Me. - You! - And she wants to have it in the conference room? - I can tell her how you feel, sir. - Okay. - Oh, we going in the conference room. [laughing] - Rain, we're going in the conference room. We're only going in the conference room, because I don't want to mess up what's already been planned, okay? That's the only reason we're going in the conference room. Not because of what Sister Harris said. - [Felix] You got it. - It's because what I said! We're going to the conference room cause I said so! And I am the-- - [Both] The senior Deacon of this church! - And don't nobody in here forget it! - Whatever you say. To the conference room! - To the conference room. - To the conference room! - [Rain] Yes. - [Felix] Because Deacon said so. - [Rain] That's right! - [Felix] Not Maple. - Meetings start at nine o'clock. Every single meeting we've ever had, starts at nine o'clock, on the dot. You know that, Vernon. So don't go trying to change things just cause you're upset. - I'm not upset, okay? Let's make this perfectly clear. I'm just being passionate about our church. Is it okay to be passionate about our church? [laughing] - They're always like this. Like an old married couple, except without being married, and without being a couple, but... - [Vernon] Isn't that what this is all about? - No one wants-- - What's best for the church! - No one wants what's best for this church more than I do, Vernon. - Actually, I too, want what's best for this church. - [Maple] Oh, shut up, no one's talking to you. Now, before we begin our meeting, first of all--- - First of all, let me clear this up, about this meeting thing. Officially, this is not a meeting, okay? This is a meeting before a meeting. I just wanna throw that out there. Because if the word gets out, it'll create quite a stir. So this here, what us four is having right here, is not a meeting, okay? I just want to be perfectly clear on that. - [Maple] If we are sitting-- - I don't care what you call it, but this is not a meeting. - It is a meeting. - [Vernon] No, it's not a meeting. - It's a meeting. - But... - Vernon, it's a meeting. - This is no meeting, Maple! I have not called any of the, I did not give any authorization about this. - [Maple] Vernon? - [Vernon] Yes? What, Felix? - Actually, I have an opinion on whether this is a meeting or not, but I was told to shut up. - Oh, Felix hush! - No, no, no, no! - You shut up too! - Don't be shutting a man up! The man's got an opinion. Maple, you're being ridiculous. You're being ridiculous. - Listen! She's being ridiculous. - Meetings start at nine o'clock. - [Vernon] Mm-hmm. We are not starting before nine o'clock. I have never started a meeting sooner than nine, nor will I start a meeting later than nine. So just sit down somewhere, with all that you're doing, burning calories, just fanning heat, just making us hot just looking at you. - [Vernon] Hey look, you don't have to be scared of her. - [whispering] I'm scared. - [Maple] Now sit down somewhere. Now go on and sit! - Okay. I can't believe this, I'm the senior Deacon of this church. - Stay seated. And Rain... The agenda? - I may have left it on the Pastor's printer. I'll go see. - You need to be more careful. You can't just leave the agenda sitting around. What if the pastor finds it? He can use it against us, baby. - Hey look, that's why we should have discussed all this last week. You all waited till the last minute, to start discussing all this, and this is what you get. - I was organizing the clothing drive last week. And the choir was going into competition last week. - Which we took eighth place, by the way. - Oh, by the way, there were only eight choirs. - There's no winners and losers, when you're singing for The Lord. Just willing participants in a showcase for The Almighty. - So tell me, Vernon, when did we have time for this meeting? - [Vernon] Well, if you had listened to me-- - [Maple] Rain, the agenda please. - Deacon said you don't have to be scared of her. - [whispering] She's scary. [knuckles popping] - I am not messing with her. I heard things... - And please hurry, because it wouldn't be fair to the rest of us to be late, just because you weren't prepared. Sit down, Vernon. - You happy? I cannot believe this. The senior deacon of this church, a city councilman. I have never-- - Former! Former city councilman. [giggling] - Ms Dupree. - Pastor Owens, I didn't know anyone was in here. I thought you were coming in at 10. - I just thought I'd get here a little early. - No harm in that. - [Tanisha] I was noticing that there were a few appointments still left in the calendar. I could do volunteer work around here, too... - Right, about those, I was supposed to cancel those, but with everything going on, it just totally slipped my mind. I really should have cancelled those. - Some of these have been on the books for months. - [laughing] Do you know how many pastors this church can go through in a few months? [laughing] Tough crowd. - No worries, if they were booked weeks in advance, I'll see them. - I mean, they may not even show. Half the congregation left, when they found out you were the new pastor... What I was trying to say, is with Pastor Stevens going through that scandal, and just leaving like that, no one really trusts the board's judgment anymore... Not saying that you're untrustworthy, because I don't know you like that. But see we just thought Pastor Williams would get the job, and half the congregation left when he did. So I just kind of thought the appointments would cancel themselves. [crickets chirping] And now, I'm shutting up! - Well, I'll just stick around, just in case they do decide to show. Is that okay? - Of course, but they probably won't show. - Just in case they do. - [Maple] Rain, the agenda please! - Just need to grab these. [laughing] And I'll be out of your way. - Okay, but are those for the meeting? - Because if they are, we'd like a copy, please. - They know. The meeting, no definitely not for the meeting. - Then what is it? [Rain laughing] Because if it's for the meeting, you do know that we have a right to have a copy. - The duty to inform, the bylaws clearly state-- - [Rain] I know what the bylaws say. She's been here, what two minutes? And she already knows the bylaws? I didn't even know we have bylaws. It's an invitation to my sister's wedding. - Mmm... - Lord, forgive me for lying in church. But this is not the worst thing committed in this office. It's a small affair, very small. Well, everyone's here. I'll let everyone know you're here. - Give us a few minutes, if you don't mind. The pastor needs his coffee. Without his coffee-- - [laughing] Say no more. I mean, we're all early anyways. Ha, when' s the last time that's ever happened in a black church? [Rain laughing] Alright, well I'll see you in a few. The conference room, that's where we'll be. - Do you mind if I take a look at the invitation? - [gasping] She knows. - What in the... [mumbling] - It's edible. - I'll pass. You sure? - Mm-hmm. - I don't trust that woman. - Oh, the reason I freaked out back there, is because these are more than just talking-points. It's kind of hard to catch them off-guard, if they know the actual agenda. - Oh, excuse me... - By the by, that's Pastor Owens, the new preacher. And that ice-queen, is Tanisha Bell. What she does, I don't exactly know. But whatever it is, it's annoying. It's really weird too. Cause I'm usually up on everything around here. I have a real sharp eye. - How rude. - She looked like she was in a hurry, baby. I'm sure she didn't mean any harm by it. - I said it was rude. - Sure, look it was rude, it was rude. - Thank you. - Print that out. [catching breath] - Just need to catch my breath. I mean, this might just all be a huge misunderstanding. This day might turn out to be a pretty good day. The pastor seems like a nice guy. This might not go as bad as I initially thought. But, I handled that well, right? - I can't believe this. - This church has been through a lot. It's natural for them to be a little defensive about me. - [Tanisha] This is more than defensive. They're trying to render you useless. You can look at me all you want. I know what I'm talking about. - Well, at least it can't get any worse. There's somebody behind me, isn't there? - Rain. - Damon? What are you doing here, I hired your father. - I can explain. - Fine, I'm listening. - I didn't expect you-- - [Rain] Well... - Give me a second. - Don't bother. The boiler-room is in the same place it's always been. - Listen, Rain, I really appreciate-- - [Rain] Save it! Just fix the AC, please. I'll let the pastor know you're here. I know that was rude. But I'll have to explain later. I have bigger fish to fry. And I need to stay focused. May I help you? - See, not rude, just busy. - We have a session for marital counseling. - You do? - Yep. - Here? - Uh-huh. - You two? But you're... You're... You're... - We're new to town. I have my appointment card in my purse, if you want to see it. - No, that won't be necessary. We've been having a lot of changes going on around here. So, it's been a little confusing. - Well listen, if you guys are busy, we can come back, we'll leave. - No, Pastor Owens is in. Maybe he can help. - Pastor Owens? I think our appointment was with somebody else. I'm just gonna check. - No need, I'm sure it was. He's our new pastor. - [ Kita] Oh. - Wait, did you say new pastor? Then we've got to go, babe. I mean, we've got to leave. Cause we can't do that with a new pastor. Cause they've got to learn the bible. So it's okay, we're just gonna get out of here. We're gonna take... - Learn the bible, really? It doesn't matter who we see. We need this session. - It's court-ordered. - It's not court-ordered. It's just my husband, he knows how to get under my skin, that's all. Court-ordered, whatever. - It is, she's actually got the papers, in her purse, right there. And when we're done with this, she's got to go to anger-management, because of this really funny story. I should tell you about-- - Don't pay him any mind. - Are you members of this church? - No. When I called, nobody said that we had to be. Do we have to be? Because nobody told me that we had to be. - See, I told you this was a bad idea. I told her that this was a bad idea, that we should-- - You didn't say anything. He never says anything. Unless it's negative. - Unless it's negative? - See? - Wow. - I'm sorry, we'll just leave. - No, no, no, it's fine. Members or not, you two need help. I'll be right back. - Learning the bible? Sonny... - Does anyone ever knock, around here? - It's okay, my door's always open. - Well, two things. Someone's here to fix the AC. - Oh, that's wonderful, thank you. - And your first appointment is here. - They showed? - They showed? - They showed. - Oh, okay. Great, send them in. I'll just speak to them before we meet, since we weren't supposed to meet until 10 anyway. Is that okay? - Sounds great. What time do you have, by the way? - 8:57. - Great. - One more thing. Can you tell your sister we said congratulations about her engagement party? - Yes. - Yeah, the wedding is here correct? [laughing] - I don't even have sister. But, my best friend's sister's supervisor's daughter, is getting married. She's like a sister. Kinda, to me. Does that count? Yeah? Oh, I'll be with you in just a minute. - I saw you. - Saw me what? What? - Oh, I saw you, oh I saw. You don't think I did, but I did. Oh, I did. - [Tanisha] She lied to us, Malik. They're up to something. - Relax, let's just see what they have to say. - I need a coffee. - You don't drink coffee. - Well, you need a coffee, I'll be right back. - Tanisha! I know you, let it go. Leave it alone. - You're the pastor. [breathing heavily] I should really get back there. Sister Harris doesn't like tardiness. The meeting, which isn't a meeting, is supposed to start at nine. You don't want to get on her bad side. I once seen her volunteer brother Thomas, to handle security for when Pastor Turner came and guest-spoke at the Baptist school-rally, for the kids. If you've ever been to one of Pastor Turner's sermons, you know he can preach, for hours. Brother Thomas had to soak his feet, for two days! - What took you so long, where's the agenda? What in the world? - [Felix] Kinda looks like a dog ate it. - No, no, not a dog, this looks like, some sort of rodent or something bit into it. - A rodent with cavities. - I do not have... Whatever. There's something I need to tell y'all about Pastor Owens. - Not now, we're about to begin. - [Rain] But I-- - Not now. Young people want to speak out of turn. - I need to catch my breath anyway, Suits me just fine. - Okay, now let's get on with the meeting. - [Vernon] Thank you. - Can I say something? - What is it? - [Rain] Pastor Owens is here. - What, well he's early. He said he was gonna be here at 10 o'clock. - Oh, see this what happens when you try to be sneaky. - Oh, Maple, Maple I think he's caving. - [Felix] Oh no! [crying] - He's caving. - [Maple] He's not caving. - Oh, I'm caving, I'm caving. - See, he's caving. - I don't want no part of this! - [Rain] New pastors bring new changes. Our last pastor brought us Felix. - [Vernon] You caving? - I'm caving. - [Rain] So, with Pastor Owens, we decided we are gonna lay down the law with him, before he can even start reconstructing the church. One, we all keep our jobs. The economy is rough, you know what I'm saying? Two, if there's to be any new board, it has to be at comprised of at least five old church members. Not old, like age, but old as in, been here for a while. And three, we stay at the same bank we've always used. And the rest is just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo, that, you know, he should easily agree to. - No caving in church, man up! [breathing heavily] - There you go. There. - I'm fine. - Good. - [Felix] I'm officially manned-up. [patting] Must have been a hot-flash or something. - Yeah. - Oh, I'm fine. - You okay? - Carry on. - There you go, buddy. - [Rain] The pastor seems like a nice guy. It's no big deal, just relax. - My dear, sweet, naive girl. You don't get it do you? Of course you don't, and you know why? Because you're not a good church secretary. [screeching] - Okay, I don't care who she thinks she is, she does not have too many more times to talk to me like that. A woman has her limits, and I am teetering on the edge. - You see dear, our membership numbers have been slashed in half, in a matter of weeks. Pastor Stevens raided the church-fund, when he married that floozy. - Okay... - So, the bylaws state-- - I'm really gonna need to read those bylaws. - That we with a crises, such as the one that we are faced with, the pastor can do a massive take-over, over the church affairs. Now Pastor Stevens and the deacons before Pastor Stevens resigned, chose this other pastor without the church members' consent. - And he's acting-pastor, for the record. Acting, acting. - Well, anyway. Pastor Stevens knew the bottom was gonna fall out. And he chose this puppet, to put in his place, to cover his skeletons before the real truth came out. You see, this is bigger than Pastor Stevens, just running off with some teenage girl. - It is? - Mm-hmm, and that's why we're all here, to make sure that this pastor makes decisions that benefit this congregation, as a whole. It's all in there. Or, it was. - [Vernon] I thought she was on-board. - She is, she's just a little dense. - Hey now, I heard that, I am here. - It was meant to be heard. - Hi, excuse... People here are so rude. - She seemed like she was busy. Besides, the other woman said that there was gonna be a person coming here in a minute to talk to us, so... - Mmm, mm-hmm, yeah. You would take her side, wouldn't you? You took that other lady's side too. What is it about my side, that you never take it, huh? Bet if I was dressed all professional like that, and I was wearing that dress, then you'd take my side. - No side of you would fit in that dress. - Excuse me? - Huh, what? I didn't say anything, dear. - What about the pastor? - [Vernon] Acting-pastor, acting. Important distinction. - [Tanisha] Knock, knock. You see how I did that, there? I knocked before I entered. [laughter] - Actually, you just said knock, knock, and then you just came in. Kind of the same thing I did. [laughing] - Can we help you with something? - Yeah, I just wanted to let you know there's fresh coffee in the kitchen. - I could go for some coffee. - [Vernon] No thank you, Felix. - [Felix] I'm fine, thanks. - [Tanisha] So, I'll let the pastor know we're getting started with the meeting? Or is it too soon? - No, now's fine. - 10, is fine. - Now is fine. - 10 is fine. - Now is fine, thank you very much. - Vernon? - Well. - There's something about her, I really don't like. Tanisha... It may be the laugh. And why is she even here? Who told her that she could touch the coffee-maker? Ta-nisha. [laughing] Did you hear that? I've never heard anybody laugh like that. Maybe a hyena. [laughing like a hyena] I think that's what they do. [laughing] - [Tanisha] Oh, hi can I help you? - [Kita] We have a meeting with the pastor. - You do? - Yes. - You two? - Why does everybody keep asking us that? - Yeah. Okay, I'm sorry, I feel like we've been waiting really patiently, very patiently, and everybody keeps zipping past us like we're not even here. Well, guess what. We're here. - Indeed you are. And we just had a bit of a mix-up with our scheduling. So, if you just give us a few minutes, I'll go get the pastor, shortly. Coffee? - Yeah, yeah, thank you. - Okay, great. Okay, well you enjoy that, and we'll be with you in a little bit. [giggling] Thank you. - I like her, I think she's nice. - Yeah, she's a nice lady. - What do you mean by nice? - [Rain] Maybe we should do this later. I think she's onto us. - Can't, tailgating at the Pointer Sisters tribute concert tonight. - Lord, why doesn't that surprise me? - [Felix] What? - I vote for later. I think she's up to something, I can feel it. - Long trip to get a cup of coffee. - Sorry, you ready for this meeting? - What about the marriage counseling. - Aw, they'll be alright, let's go. - Can I at least get my things together first, please? - Look people, this is our church, okay? If we have to buckle down, then that's what we're gonna do. We're not gonna have this pastor just waltz in here, and take over my church. Well, our church. - Vernon, why don't we just say what we have to say? And then Rain and Felix, they can just grin and nod. Y'all can do that can't you? - As long as it's before the opening number. I'm not missing I'm So Excited for nobody. - Something about Deacon Pride and Sister Harris' urgency, just isn't right, they're up to something. I can feel it. But, I'll play along. - Knock, knock. - Not a knock... - Pastor Owens, my pleasure, I'm Vernon Pride. I appreciate you coming here, out of your extremely busy schedule to meet with us. I really do. - Thank you. - Okay, so I think we can get started. - Yes, I think we're all here, so we can get started right away. - [Maple] Let's start by taking a look at the agenda. Why don't you just take one of these and pass it around. Thank you. - I'm confused, this agenda, it's very different from this one. So [laughing] I'm a little confused. - I knew she knew. - I think what she's trying to say is that, it came to our attention that some of the concerns you may have, may be a little bigger than we first anticipated. - Well, we do have a few concerns. - Oh, drop the act lady. We all know what this is. - We do? - The bylaws state that the church's board, or what's left of it, you four, after stating your grievances, have a right to officially select a call to vote for a new pastor. And my guess is the vote would need to be a unanimous one. You tried to call this little meeting before Sunday, when we elect additional members for the board? - Okay, I really need to read up on these bylaws. This bylaw business, bylaws, where are the bylaws? Can somebody get me bylaws? - What did she just say? - She's smart. - I got that, but what did it all mean? - It's a coup, Felix. We're taking our church back. - So, this isn't just about presenting a unified agenda to the new pastor? - Are you sure this is what you want to do? This church has been through so much already. - I did not sign up for this. This makes having your pastor step down, because he sent a lewd picture to the deacon's wife, seem like the good old days. You can't knock? - I just, I need to check the thermostat. But I could always come back though. - Look, let the man do his work. It's hot in here. How about we all just take a break? Take a minute to let what just happened, settle in, huh? - You know a 20 minute break would probably do us all some good. - [Tanisha] 20 it is. - I don't know about anyone else but, I could sure use a cookie. - Boy is always eating. - [Sonny] [yelling] Hello? Anybody? No? - [Rain] I just don't know about this, Deacon. - What do you mean you don't know? How long you been attending this church? This is our church. This is what we're here to fight for, is our church. - [Rain] I know, but do we have to be so sneaky? I mean, why can't we be out in the open with this? - Well, technically, we are out in the open, okay? We're just doing it a different way than you're used to doing it. - [Maple] And we have to be discreet, okay? And that's why I hinted at you going over the bylaws. You did go over the bylaws, didn't you? - Of course I did, I just didn't interpret it the same way you did. That's my last lie in church, I promise. - [Tanisha] I just can't with this place, it's a mess. - Look, just give it a chance. - I don't want to hear it. You're letting them walk all over you. - I'm not-- Little lairs running around here eating paper? something's wrong with them. - You have to have a backbone, Malik. - You're not letting me talk... Look, just be patient. Everything is gonna be alright. - You like being a choir director, don't you Felix? - I love it, love it, love it. - You hear that, he loves it. He loves being a choir director. - It's my calling. - It's his calling. - It's what I was born to do. - It's what you were born to do, praise God! Has anyone in this room ever seen this church, in better hands, as a choir director, than Felix? - Of course we have. Speak up now. He's terri... terrific, he, he is good. He's a fine, fine young man. - Yes you are, you're a fine, fine young man. Now let me just purpose this, so to speak. Do you realize that if another pastor stepped into this church, he would have the right, he would have the authority, to bring in his own choir director? Did you know that? - That is true. - [Felix] Mm-mmm. - Yes, oh yes. He could have you fired, tomorrow. - I could lose my job? - You could lose your job. You could be out there singing, up there on Sunset Strip, for your supper, at the blink of an eye, and wouldn't even know it. - Coup d'etat. - [Vernon] That's the revolution! - Carpe diem. - [Vernon] That's the spirit! - The revolution! - [Vernon] - The revolution! - Will not, be televised. - [Vernon] Will not be televised. - Power to the people! - [Vernon] Power to the people. - We will protect this house. - [Vernon] We will protect this house. - King Kong ain't got nothing on me! - [Maple] That's enough. Now we all know the situation here, okay? - [Vernon] Mm-hmm. And we understand that what we talk about in this room, has to stay in this room. No notes, no recorders, no nothing. Is that clear? - [Felix] Clear. - We must all agree that tomorrow, when this pastor comes in here, we will ask the congregation, - [Rain] What's left of it. - If they'll return, bringing in Pastor Owens, and vote for me, yours truly. Do I get a vote? Do I get these three votes, from you guys? - [Felix] You got mine. I gotta keep my job. - [Vernon] Do I get an amen? - Do I get a hallelujah? - Hallelujah. - [Tanisha] I know what they're up to. This church board's reputation just speak for itself. But, I was ready for this. - What are you doing? - I can have 250 people here, from Pilgrim's mission, in time for tomorrow's meeting, and squash their little plan, in five minutes. - That won't be necessary. You can do that? - In a heartbeat. - No, no it won't be necessary. You seriously know how to do that? - Mm-mm. - Sister Harris, is this what you want? - Well, of course it is. Our window is slipping. We may come in tomorrow and not even recognize our old congregation. - [Vernon] Mm-hmm. - Now that new preacher, may bring in all kinds of new members. This may be the last time we can control the vote. - But what if it isn't? Three pastors, in so few weeks, I mean, it's kinda messy. I mean, don't we have enough problems? - This is all wrong, this is not the way I wanted to start my tenure at the Church of Truth. - Malik, if you don't do something, your tenure's gonna be over before it even starts. We have to do something. - You know he was a radical at his last church. And if he was a radical at his last church, imagine what he will do here. Are you aware that at his last church, he didn't even give a Christmas play? He didn't even do that. He was feeding homeless people under a bridge, people! - [Felix] Oh, man. - Do we want a man like this in our church? He didn't even believe in a church play? - [Felix] No church play! - Have you ever heard of a man not having a church play at the church? - What? - I haven't. How? - Never. - Hallelujah. Look, we already lost half of our congregation. - That's right. - We cannot afford to lose anybody else, if this radical pastor comes in and takes over. - That might not be so bad. We lost half the one we had. - Are you kidding me? Look at what he did at his last church. We can't take that chance, Rain. You guys gotta vote for me. And I promise you, there will be a change. I will make everything better. Am I right, Felix? - He's right. - Am I right, Maple? - [Maple] Amen. - You put me in charge and I promise you, this will be the church of churches. - [Felix] Vote for Deacon Pride. - [Vernon] Vote for Deacon Pride. Look, you were involved in a huge financial scandal, Rain. - Oh, no, I know you do not think I had anything to do with that? - Oh, child, we know you didn't have anything to do with the scandal. - Well, it did cross my mind. - [Maple] Felix... - [Felix] I'm just saying, she did come in here, with the new boots that one time. I'm in church, I can't tell a lie. - Okay, what if he wants a new church secretary? What if he doesn't trust you? - I don't know what to think anymore. But my mother told me if I had to choose between two liars, pick the one I know. All this mess going on inside the church, I don't even know if it's worth fighting for. - Rain, are you with us or not? I gotta keep my job. I'm running out of singing competitions to try-out for. - Rain, you are very, very important to this church. I mean, extremely important. All the young people look up to you, okay? Felix, he's the choir director. He brings in all the members who want to sing, da-da-da-dance and hallelujah, and praise God and everything, and Maple here, she takes care of the, you know, the more mature members and everything, and me, I bring in a ton of people, because I'm the city councilman. - [Everyone] Former! - Whatever! Look, I need you three to vote for me tomorrow. Can I get an amen on that? - [Felix] Amen. - Amen. - Can I get a hallelujah? - Hallelujah. - Hallelujah. - Can I get the three votes, from my people I dearly care about? - [Maple] You got my vote. - [Felix] You got mine. I wanna keep my job. - [Vernon] That's what I'm talking about. - Since when have you wanted to be the pastor? - Since I was a little bitty boy. Ever since I could walk, I wanted to be a pastor. Praise God, you just give me the moment. And I could praise God, I could sing. You just tell me what to do, and I'm on my way. Because Holy Ghost is in my spirit, praise God. There's nothing like singing for The Lord. You ask me how long I've been doing this, how long I wanted to be a pastor. Ever since I was a little boy. - Let's just hope that passion don't earn you another handicap parking spot. - Now Rain, I know this is a lot for you, okay? So I want you to take a little time, and really think about it. Now I don't want you to take too much time, because the meeting in tomorrow. And if we all agree, okay? Then we have a lot to do. We have a lot of phone calls to make. Because we have to rally the troops. - Why couldn't you just let us know what this was all about, instead of having us jump through all these hoops? - Not to be offensive, but you two gossip way too much. So if I had told you any sooner, the whole world would know. Loose lips sink ships. - I think I'm offended. I do not gossip, I am not a gossiper. Felix, I mean maybe. But me, Ha! Not at all, I haven't sold you anything. I'm not a gossiper, that's wrong. That's like one of the sins One of the eight or nine, seven. Can I get a minute? I must be a glutton for punishment, to put up with what I do around here. It's a thankless job, the pay isn't good, and I have to deal with stuff like this. Mercy. - Look, I held up my end of the bargain. Felix is on-board. You said you had Rain. You better be talking to that girl. - Oh, Rain is fine. She just has a little flare for the theatrics. You know, we just have to let it sink in a little bit. - What is the deacon really up to? Why does he remind me of a used car salesman? Who wants a used car salesman, as the face of their church? I have so many questions about this congregation. - She knows what's best for this church. - We need this, Maple. - Oh, she'll be-- [crashing] Do you mind? - I'm sorry I was just-- - Leaving? Bye. - Right. - [Vernon] Later. Adios, catch you later. I'm eating a potato, all that good stuff. - Always getting in the way. - My goodness. - Is Felix really going along with this? He's a great guy, very simple in fact. But, in a good way, you know? He's like an amoeba, a single-celled organism, with very bad fashion, and a bad singing voice. But really a great guy. Yeah. - You've gotta talk to Rain, okay? Reel her in, come on now. - You know I have this, don't you? - Alright, alright I'm counting on you, baby. - Who's running stuff? Alright, I'm counting on you, baby. - In case you haven't noticed, Damon and I have a history. It was good and complicated. I was the good, he was the complicated. - [Damon] Rain? - I'm busy. - [Damon] Rain, come on. - Fix the AC, and get out. Okay, that time I was mean. But trust me, he really deserved it. - Hi, excuse me. - Yes? - Are you the pastor? - Me? [laughing] No, no, my name is Felix. I'm the choir director. Felix Bosier. - Oh... [laughing] Oh, is that Creole? I like it. - Actually, I am Creole on my second stepfather's side of the family. - Creole my butt. - And you're the choir director? - Yeah. - You know, I sing. - Really? - First he's Creole and now you're a singer? Huh, really? - Maybe you should come audition for the choir sometime. We'd love to have you. - Oh, we'd love to have you. - Sonny, behave yourself. I'm sorry, he's a giant child. - Really? Looks like a grown man to me. [whispering] Maybe it's that Benjamin Button disease. - I was joking, you don't... [laughing] You're bring funny. - I am? [laughing] - Yes, I find a man with a sense of humor just absolutely refreshing. - [Felix] You do? - I do. He's so funny. - Funny. - Funny. - I'm Funny? - Fun-larious. - I'm fun-larious. - Sit. - You know, he doesn't need to sit, I don't think. You got, I mean, I'm sure you've got some choir directing to do. - Oh, pish-poss. Actually, I'm on a break right now. - He's on a break right now. - Yeah, you know I just got a lot going on. - A lot going on. - Been kind of a rough day. Got a lot on my mind. - So much on his mind. - Actually, pretty stressful day. - Really stressful day. Oh, a stressful day? - [Felix] Yeah. - Oh, come sit. - I said he doesn't have to-- - He can sit. - If you two want me to go I-- - This has nothing to do with you! - [Sonny] You actually really should stay out of it. - Maybe you should stay out of this. I think that he can sit down if he wants to sit down. He's had a hard day. He's been working all day at this... - I just can't imagine Deacon Pride as the pastor. What's even more surreal is Sister Harris is going along with it. I can see her wanting Pastor Williams as the pastor. I mean, he was our last assistant pastor, but the deacon? Something isn't right. - Can I sit down? - You're already sitting. - Oh, yeah I hate when that happens. - [Rain] They sent you out to try to win me over? - No, do you think you need to be won over? - I mean, you don't think it's odd that Deacon and Sister Harris are teaming up together? They never agree on anything. They squabble over the Christmas party, the building fund, Sunday school, you name it. And then they agree on Deacon being the head pastor? - Man, they said we could keep our jobs, Rain. That's all I care about. You know she says she's raising our raise. Man, the struggle's real. - [Rain] Hmm. What about who's right for the church? I mean, Deacon Pride is, well, Deacon Pride. - [Felix] You're a good person, Rain. You know that? - Thank you. - You're supposed to say I'm a good person too. [laughing] - I was just about to. - No you wasn't. Sometimes I... Sometimes I don't feel like one. - No, you're the sweetest person I know. - Really? - Yeah. - You really mean that? - Of course I do, everyone thinks that. - I wanna tell you something. - Okay. - Can I tell you something that I've never told anyone before? Something... Something that I've been harboring for a long time? Something that might be important? - Of course you can, you can tell me anything. We're friends. - Well, okay look, it all happened a couple months-- - Hold that thought. - And I was-- - Yeah, yeah, hold on. One second, come here. You're everywhere except fixing the AC. - [Damon] I need to talk to you. - We don't have anything to talk about. That's right, I didn't think so. - If you don't talk to me-- - You'll what? - I'll tell everybody about that night. - What night? - December 15th, senior year, that night. - That was a low blow. It's not as bad as he just made it sound. It was December 15th, it was late and... I am not telling you this story! It's not as bad as you think. It's not. Fine, let's talk. - You get ready to pour your heart out to someone, and no one wants to listen. I don't understand the-- - [Kita] I'll listen! - [Felix] Huh? - Oh, you can pour your heart out to us, I'll listen. - [Sonny] Actually, she can't, cause we were just leaving, we're gonna go. - [Kita] Oh, but you can't listen to him, because he's incapable of listening, himself. - I mean, if it's not gonna be any trouble. I don't want it to get weird or anything, but... - [Rain] God, he's beautiful. Look at those eyes. He thinks he can just show up on my church steps, and just pop up any time he wants, like nothing ever happened. Let me give you a quick rundown of what he did, before he tries to lure you in with those eyes of his. He moves halfway across the country, to be with a weirdo cousin of his, to open a restaurant. He asked me to go with him, at the last minute. And he just expected me to drop everything. Like I didn't already have a life. - Look, we need to talk. - You've said that a million times already. - I'm sorry. - Fine, great talk we're done. - No, will you stop with the attitude? This is serious. - I haven't talked to you in over three years, Damon. You get up and you just move, and like nothing ever happened. You don't really give me any warning, it's like the night before, it's so-- - I asked you to come with me. - I'm talking. You get up and you move. You don't answer my calls or my texts. I get a friend request from you, one day on Facebook, with a relationship status stating, that you're in a relationship. And she was hideous, too. Hideous, and I'm not just saying that. You can look at the pictures and judge for yourself. Don't take my word for it. - [Felix] I could use some support on this. You guys members of the church? Okay, that was confusing. Hey look, I don't want this to get weird, maybe I-- - Actually, you wanna know what's weird? Huh, you wanna know what's weird? Is coming to marriage counseling with your wife, okay? And first of all, being stood up by the pastor. Second, having my wife flirt with the interior designer. - I'm the choir director. - Yeah. - I'm gonna let that slide. Because my emotional space is really busy right now. And I just need to ease it on out. - You didn't come with me, what was I supposed to do? - He should have stayed miserable! He should have stayed single. He should have pined over me, every single day. But that's just one girl's opinion. You know what, it doesn't matter. It really doesn't, because I'm over it. You leaving, was the best thing that could ever happen to me. I got my stuff together, I joined the church, and I never looked back. - You look good. - So does he. What do you want? - We've been best friends since eighth grade. I just want my friend back, Rain. That's all I want. I mean, I had to go out there and see what was out there. If I didn't go, I mean, I was drowning out here. - I was here. - That's not what I mean. If I didn't chase my dreams, I would've went crazy, you should understand that. - What I understood it to be, is that we were a couple. - Oh, don't pay him any mind. I know, honey. - My feelings... - Get up honey, I'll listen to you. You talk it out with me. That'll be fine. - [Felix] Don't know why everybody wants to hurt old Felix. - [Kita] Oh, I know darling, I know. - [Felix] Nobody wants to talk, nobody wants to listen. - [Kita] You can talk to me, I'm here for you. - [Felix] Cause Felix matters. - [Kita] Felix matters! - [Felix] But does anybody else... - Should've listened to my mother. Sure she... - Remember what I told you the day I left? - Yeah. - Do you? - If you think we're getting back together, is gonna happen, you are dreaming, okay? Why are you even here? - To fix the AC. - [Rain] I called your father, not you. - And he sent me. I mean, come on, of all the air and heating places in the world, you call my dad's? Didn't you think for one split second, this might have happened? Rain? - It crossed my mind, for a second. Maybe, a millisecond maybe. - Just a millisecond? - If that. Don't flatter yourself, cause I'm over it. I really don't care. What I do care about is getting the AC fixed. - That's all you care about? - That's it. - I don't think it's the furnace. - Well, if it's not the furnace, then what is it? - Well, this building has a master-slave arrangement. The main thermostat in the building, is fitted for the entire property. It determines whether or not to be heated. And I think the master is broken, and if I can fix that, then all the thermostats will work. Alright? - That is one fine man, sitting across from me. When he starts talking all that technical stuff, and sounding all employed and stuff, it does something to me. But I have to be cool. He hurt me. I have to protect myself, he hurt me. You just made all that up. Are you really gonna fix the AC? - Did you not just hear the explanation I just gave you? That's a grade-A answer, girl. Okay, grade-A. I assure you, I am an expert. - Really? What am I doing? I'm totally letting him back in. I can't be that stupid, I can't be. I'm not that stupid. I need to protect myself. Bitter woman system activate. He thinks he can just charm his way back into my life. He is so sadly mistaken. Damon, you know what, it's not really a good time. - Is there anything I can do to help? [laughing] - Is there anything you can do, no I think you've done enough. - Okay, whatever it is though, remember to trust your gut. - My gut, well thank you, but I kinda think this is something I need to handle on my own. I mean, I've been doing that for the past few years now. - I'm not gonna keep apologizing for this, Rain. - Fine. - Fine, okay? - [Rain] Okay. - [Damon] Okay. - You think she's gonna go for it? - If she knows what's good for her, she'll vote for you. Quit worrying, it's in the bag. - I'm so over it. Whatever, why is it so hard to trust people now-a-days? What is Damon really up to? I need to get back inside. They're probably waiting on me. - I felt kinda bad. I know my church is falling apart, but I can't help but think about Damon. He's my only true love. Well, my first love really. And only true love. There was this one time... - If we could hurry this along, the pastor has a busy schedule. - [sighing] Ugh, I can't stand it when she interrupts my monologues. It's like when she does it the most. It's like she knows. - Really, can we? - She did it again. I can't stand it when she does that, she-- - I'll be frank with you, Pastor Owens. - Why not be you, Deacon Pride? Don't be Frank, be you. You're special how you are. - Felix, shut up, okay? I'm metaphorically talking to this gentleman here. - Can I say something? - I think you've said quite enough. - Well, I think this church has been through quite enough. You've all stated your grievances. You're free to call for a vote tomorrow. - Then I guess there's nothing else to talk about. - May I interject? - [Vernon] Sure. - Now, you all seem like very nice people, who clearly loves their church. Now, I've been pastor here, all of five minutes, and it's clear that the congregation of this church, is very tight. And I don't think this church can take another hit, honestly. So if that means backing out, I'll do it. - You'll do what? You can't quit. - I'm not saying I'll quit. But I'm not gonna fight a vote for change. I'm not gonna negotiate my vision for this church. I'm not going to play politics, engage in gossip, or whatever it is you do in the middle of drama. I won't do it, I won't. - If you don't fight for this, you won't have a church to preach that wonderful message to. - If it's God's will... - You're making a mistake, Malik. - No, if it's God's will, that pretty much trumps anything you could ever say. That's kind of a rule. - You're an idiot. - If it's God's will, then that's what I'll be. - It this is how you want to play it, then fine, fine! But they will win. The church will follow their four votes. - I won't start out here, like this. Excuse me. - Oh, I like that man. - [whispering] Yeah, great pastor. - [Kita] Excuse me, excuse me. Excuse me! - Yes, how can I help you? - We have a session. We have a scheduled session. - I'm just-- - No, no, no, you don't get to talk anymore. You can't spin me around, okay? I have it, I have it right here. I have it in my purse. It has been scheduled for weeks. It is nine o'clock with pastor Kyle, at 914 Washington street. - Pastor Kyle, 914 Washington street. - 914 Washington street. - Look, this is 1914 Washington street. You're looking for Saint Paul's Baptist. It's down the street. Sorry for any confusion, if there's anything we can-- - Do you mean to tell me, that this is not 914 Washington street? That I have been sitting here. - It's not. - This whole time, in this sweat-box, - Guys, you should move away. this whole time. Do it quickly, do it quickly. - I know this is a church, but I'm about to lose my mind up in here! - [Sonny] Run, run, run! - I've been in here all day, like boo-boo the fool, okay? - [Sonny] Remember the scriptures. - And I'm supposed to be down the street. You are too fully grown to be getting lost in the town that you grew up in. This is all your fault! Sonny! - Now all you gotta do is vote for me. You vote for me, and I'll make sure everything is back to normal, with the four of us. - Three. - Three? - Did she say three? - I said three. I'm going with my gut on this one. Deacon Pride, I'm not gonna vote against you. I'm just not gonna vote. I'm resigning from the board. - Rain, you really need to think about this, baby. - Rain, if you step down, people will think our church is dysfunctional and we're not united. You can't do that. - [Maple] So let me get this straight. You're choosing Pastor Owens, over the congregation? - [Rain] I'm not doing this for him. I'm just not gonna be pushed into making a decision, I haven't had time to think about. And I don't wanna work in an office where I have to deal with another controversy. So, I'm done. I've been going to this church since I was a little girl. Sister Harris, this church changed my mother's life. She found her true love here. She got married here and buried here. This church has been here for me, at my lowest points and I am grateful. But I am not gonna let this church use me for something that is not God's will. I'll quit before I do that. - See, God's will. It trumps everything! - Alright, Rain. So, graciously, we're gonna have to accept your resignation. It's gonna be tough. But I believe I still have three votes. I still have three votes. - Two. - What did he just say? - Two, two, you got two votes. - Felix, Felix... - [Felix] No, I've got something to say. It's been bothering me for a long time. And now that everything's out on the table, it only makes sense what's going on here. - Felix, what are you blabbering about? - Well... - [Maple] The church is gonna fall apart after this. - Maple, baby, that might not be a bad idea. - I'm listening. - Look, there's this young kid, right? His name is Malik Owens. He's associate pastor, over at New Life. - Yeah, and? - What is we bring him over to our church, and introduce him as our new pastor. - Oh, that won't work. You remember what happened after we brought that last young preacher. And he's from another church? It'll split the congregation in half. - Exactly. - Okay, I'm still listening. - Maple, baby, all we need is 2/3 votes to get him in, right? Right. Pastor Stevens is leaving. The three Deacons are stepping down. I get them to vote for him as a parting gift. - Because it's the least they could do. - That's right, baby, now you thinking. Now we're on the same wave-length here, right? I'll bring in a young kid, right? The church splits, then bam! I become savior, and Sister Harris, the Church of Truth is ours. - Oh, I like the way you think. - I like the way you like the way I think, Sister Harris. - Come here. - [Malik] Excuse me. - [Rain] Felix, I cannot believe you didn't tell me. We tell each other everything. And that does not make me a gossip, by the way. I just like to be well informed. - I wanted to but, when I saw Deacon Pride didn't vote for Pastor Owens, I thought my eyes were deceiving me. - And they were deceiving you. Cause there is absolutely, positively, nothing going on between me and Sister Maple Harris. I assure you of that, and you quote me on that. - Oh, there isn't? - Maple, baby, [laughing] what are you doing? - Oh, you are about to see why I'm scared of that woman. - I stuck by you, every step of the way, on every single decision that you made, even the ones I didn't agree with. - Yeah, I understand Maple, baby. But look, what I meant was-- - [Maple] What did you mean? - Well, I meant that if-- - I don't care what you meant. I stuck with you through the handicap parking fiasco. - [Vernon] Yes, you did. - [Maple] When you and Deacon Greenwood, fought over the church building fund, and countless other craziness up in this church. And you promised me that when you became pastor, you were gonna make me your wife. [gasping] - Oh! - Maple, baby, please this is private. Can we discuss this privately, please? - No, we cannot, I need to know now. Do you wanna be with me? - It's your move, player. - Look baby, of course I wanna be with you, of course I wanna marry you, okay? - Even if you don't become pastor? Because if you can't say that, then I can't vote for you either. - Okay, so I won't run for city councilman, because I'd rather have you. [giggling] - [Rain] Aww! See, that's what we're all about, not the back-stabbing part, but that. The love, the forgiveness, it's what people don't understand about us. - Air's back on. - I don't know, still feels pretty hot in here to me. - Do you mind if we have a minute? - [Maple] No, take all the time you need. And we need to apologize to the pastor. - No, we do not, Maple, I am not apologizing, because I did nothing wrong to apologize for. - We're apologizing. - We are not apologizing. Cause I did nothing wrong to apologize for, as I said. And that could affect my election campaign. So, no, positively not, I'm not apologizing. - Vernon, we are apologizing, now let's go. - Damon. - No, just let me talk. Don't say anything. - He doesn't even know I'm about to give in, does he? Fine. - I moved away, because I wanted us to start our life together. But I see you weren't ready for that, I get it. But just because I understand, doesn't mean it doesn't hurt me. When I moved to New York, I buried myself in my work, and I avoided all your phone calls, because I knew there was nothing I could say to you, for you to come back with me. - You knew I couldn't. My life is here. - That's why I came back. - His restaurant flopped. That's what really happened. But you didn't hear that from me. Really? - Really, yes really. No matter how well my life was going out there-- - Or who you were dating? - No matter who I was dating, no one compared to you. I came back for you. I know you probably heard the rumors about my restaurant flopping? - No, I didn't hear that. - [Damon] That's what everyone's saying. But the truth is, I'm opening up my second restaurant out here, right now. Baby, my dreams are coming true. Almost all of them. - What do you mean, almost? He's talking about me. I know he's talking about me. Not trying to brag, but it's me that he's talking about. - You. I want you. - It's getting cold in here. You really did know how to fix the AC, huh? - Remember what I told you the day I left? I told you that you and I would be together, when the time is right. That I would walk through the Sahara's hottest days, and Alaska's coldest nights, but we will be together. - You get that? See, it was hot all day and now it's cold. He's so romantic. I mean he is perfect, I could not have went to Build-a-Bear and picked out-- - Rain, what are you doing? - I was just, I was just about-- - [Felix] Oh, oh listen, I heard everything, I heard it all. And I just wanna say, this is exactly what this congregation is about. it's why I do my music. It's why I praise The Lord, because about the love, come on in, y'all come on. Let it happen, don't let it be strange. - Alright. - Because love is not strange. - Okay. - I feel like singing. - No. - No. - I love you Felix. ♪ Kumbaya - And there you have it. A typical day around here. Everybody kissed, we made up. We all prayed over it. - Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, out daily bread. - We all kissed and made up. [laughing] Yeah, a little tighter. A little more. Give me a sisterly hug. We all threw our support around the pastor. But around here, you have to be worried about controversy. [gasping] I'm sorry, I didn't-- - Knock? - You two go on about your business. I didn't see anything, I'm walking out the door. What is it about this pastor's office? Should we start renting the office out by the hour or something? - Rain? - Pastor? Future ex-pastor? Pastor Owens, whatever you do is your business. I don't know what you heard about me, but I'm not gonna say a thing. - Is she serious? - Will you just tell her? Tell her before I vomit. - I'm trying to tell her. - Then tell her. - Tell me what? - You do know Tanisha's my sister, right? - Yes, your sister of course. You two look just alike. - Really, I'm adopted. - I was referring to the upper lip area, how it goes in right there at the, like you got the two mountain peaks, which is awesome, you know? [laughing] You know what, I really have to go check on some things. I think Felix, I'll be back, I'll be back. The only controversy we're having around here now, is Felix forgot to pay the registration for this year's gospel-palooza, again. For the third year in a row. But you didn't hear it from me. I'm not one to gossip. Let me see, oh and that couple, they finally got counseling from Pastor Owens, yeah. - So, what seems to be the problem? - [Kita] Let me just start with the fact that he is completely insensitive to my feelings. - But don't tell anybody, because it's counseling and there are certain rights and privileges and other weird things that you can't talk about. So they're just doing good, I saw them. - He is not aware of how I'm feeling at all. I will be angry about something, and he won't even know that he was the reason for it. And he won't accept fault. - He won't? - [Kita] No. I feel real alone in this, I really do. I'm so glad you're here to help. - Oh, no problem. - And I got Damon to join the church. But I didn't know he was gonna be here today. Hey you. - Hey. - Nice surprise, what are you doing here? - Actually, I'm here to see Felix. - Felix? - Yes, I'm joining the choir. - No, no. - Yes, I need-- I need to follow my dreams. It's something I always wanted to do. So I'm gonna do it. - Rain, you guys can do your lovey-dovey stuff on your own time. For the next hour, he's mine. Ready? - I'm ready. ♪ La la la la la - Push it up. ♪ La la la la la Yeah, there you go. - [Vernon] Hey! ♪ La la la la la - [Vernon] Hey! - We're doing choir rehearsal. - You're making the brothers look bad. - We're covering it. ♪ La la la la la - You sound like a dying hyena. - You can join in, for sure. You wanna join in too? - [Rain] I-- - [Vernon] No, no, no! ♪ La la la la la - Stop that! - Praise The Lord! ♪ La la la la la ♪ La la la la la Woo! - So, if you don't have a church home, the Church of Truth's doors are always open. [laughing] Well, the side doors are always open. But you know what I mean. See you on Sunday. [funky music] [baby crying] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
