This movie was filmed in the same dwellings where the facts that inspired it took place. And this child? What are you doing here so early? Is anything wrong? I want to confess. Have you commited so many sins in barely 2 days... that you're in need for confession, so early in the morning? Father... I want to confess I am a witch. (Basque word for SABBATH literaly: the meadow of the he-goat) Come on, Unai, it's your turn! Inigo, aren't you jumping? Cheer up, Inigo! Jump! Come on, man! Come on! Why so serious? Where are you going? Stay. No, I'm leaving. It will soon be your time to leave. I can go with you, if you want to. I already got someone to go with me, you know it very well. Well, it's so late already, and he still hasn't showed. He'll come. Don't you worry. Why are you so mean with Inigo? If you don't like him, please try to hide it, girl. It's not a good idea to be in bad terms with a member of that family. I attend him as any costumer. Good evening everyone. Hello, Unai. Hello. Garazi was expecting you. But before you go, you'll join us for a drink... No thanks. We're in a hurry. Let's go, Garazi. Goodbye! Goodbye. Goodbye, see you tomorrow! See you! Bye! We're all here. Why don't we wait a little more, perhaps the priest will show up! Or the Lord of Andueza! They will not come. Don't worry. But it's no laughing matter, we must beware of them. Why do you say so? Tonight, it's Saint Jhon's Eve. And in nights like this, Nature speaks to those who want to listen to her. The flames of the fire, the sound of the wind, the star shine... always tell us something. And what are they saying now? Mari has crossed the sky in his chariot of fire. Her son, Odei, has descended into the mountains, Odei, you say? Odei is evil. And he will bring us evil. Odei is evil, yes. But we must not be afraid. The Basajaun will be waiting for him. And he will not permit him to do us any harm. Yes. Odei will die. And joy will never end in our valleys. But hard times may be approaching. Really hard times. Being always in the border is so boring. I think a change once in a while doesn't hurt. There have never been any soldiers in our meetings before. These guards belong in the frontier. What are they doing here? As holder of the Lordship of Anduenza I can order the troops to be wherever I see fit. Is it possible that the Lord of Anduenza is afraid of the meetings? We assist here to find solutions to our problems and soldiers are not necessary for this purpose. That's precisely one of the points I'd like to adress here. I am the one who will decide wether we need more soldiers or not. The truth is the frontier guard must be increased. And for that purpose we need new recruitments. Almost half of the young men in this town are in the corps. Do you want even more? King Felipe har ordered a strengthening of our borders. That's not our problem! And we completly disagree with this new draft and with many other things we want to discuss in this meeting. Other towns have long granted what you deny us. We want to discuss some of the Lordship's prerrogatives. Do you know what you're saying? Perpetual mayorality has been attached to the Lordship of Andueza for centuries. And its holder also has the right to appoint the priest and the commanders of the guard. Those are precisely the privilges the people of Andueza wants to discuss. And those are the ones I will never we be willing to relinquish. Because I have the sacred obligation to pass on to my son the same powers I received from my parents. An that's the reason you need more and more soldiers? No. You're wrong. I'm surprised of your words. And I'm also surprised by the fact you're trying to question rights that no one had ever questioned before. And nevertheless, you suspiciously neglect other problems. What problems? The problem of the witches, for example. What do you think of all this, Friar Domingo? I don't like it at all, Holy Father. Discussions in these meetings keep getting more violent. Reverend, Don 聲gel, the town's priest wants to talk with Father Prior. Let him in. If you don't object, I would like to leave. I have some matters to attend before our journey. I would prefer you to stay. Don 聲gel, if I'm not mistaken, would like to talk again about the witches. A problem that is currently driving him mad. What he says may be useful to you in the negotiations you'll have to undertake in Pamplona. As Father Prior wishes. Good be the mornings of the Lord. So be it. Good morning. You seem fatigued, Don 聲gel. Have a seat. I wanted your advice again, Friar Miguel. You are a learned man, quite a connoisseur on Latin and theology. Whereas, myself... What's the matter this time? Have you recieved any new confessions? Yes. There are witches in this town, Friar Miguel. I frequently recieve confessions of women accusing other women.... In the name of the Church and the Catholic faith, we have to do something, to investigate, I don't know. Maybe in a few days I'll have information about how this problem is seen in Pamplona. If it is so, be assured I'll tell you all I know. Pamplona! They won't listen to us there! They'll think it's all peasants' superstitions, ignorants' superstitons. It's here where we must find a solution! Because it is here where Catholic faith is in danger! Not in Pamplona! Today I've spoken with Don Ferm璯. With Don Ferm璯? These are matters of faith, Don 聲gel. You know well that force is necessary to defend faith.! Also is obedience! Don't forget it. It will be better to await from instructions from Pamplona. You must excuse me, Don 聲gel. The community is expecting for me. Friar Domigo will show you the exit. And be certain that, if evil indeed exists, it will be torn form its roots. Hello, Garazi. You scared me! What are you doing here? Do you want me to help you? I have no need of your help. What do you want? I went to the tavern and you weren't there. I want to talk to you. I have no time. But you have enough time to waste with Unai, don't you? Inigo of Andueza I don't want to insult you but it will be better if you let me carry on. We used to walk together in the past. You say it well: in the past! You'll heal soon. Go that way! Hurry! Who is it? It's me, Inigo of Andueza. What do you want? Open up, Amunia, I want to ask you for a favor. When did the Andueza start to actually 'ask' for anything? I want one of your ointments, one of those brews you give to lovers. Don't ask me for weird things. I don't know about that, you got the wrong house. I can pay you well. I'll bring you more money tomorrow if you want to, but give it to me. Calm down, don't lose your head. Heartache is not a good advisor. If you weren't the son of who you are, I'll throw you out. But I know you all too well. And I don't want no trouble. Amunia, give it to me. It will be better for you to calm down. Here. Drink. What's this? You ask for a brew... and then you don't trust me. Drink. Practically all the buildings in this town are yours. Including the inn, the smithy and the church. Except for a few farmhouses, most of the neighbors depend on your Household for their subsistence. Almost everything is mine. And nevertheless those bastards are going to be hard to subdue. We have other weapons. Which ones? One of them, Unai, the son of late Esparzo, is frequently seen with that young woman who works at the tavern. And so what? You'll rememeber, my Lord, that woman came to this town as a girl, with her mother, and here they stayed. They came from France. They had banished that girl's mother, after burning her grandmother as a witch. My lord, please allow me to tell you, that perhaps you should take more into consideration the worries of our good parish priest. The witches gather in their meetings, those akelarres! And they defile the Holy names of our Lord Jesus Christ and Blessed Virgin Mary. They abandon Christianity and promise to serve the Devil. With His help, they fly every night into your houses without you noticing at all. They put your children under spells with brews they make, they take them to their caves, and practice with them dishonest acts. Sinful acts! This must come to an end. We must exterminate all the witches in this town! God and the Church are willing to forgive those who repent. But, woe to the one who, being a witch, denies to confess Wretch be those who, for fear, fail to accuse those who attend the akelarres. Do you know what awaits for them? THE FIRE! The fire here on earth, and what is worst, Eternal Fire from Hell! Their bodies will be burnt in the bonfire flames. And a never ending curse will fall over their descendants. In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Friar Domingo, I was impatiently awaiting for your arrival. What news do you bring for us? When I arrived to Pamplona, the Royal Council and the Holy Office had just received a briefing from Don Ferm璯 of Andueza. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have stopped at Ilurzo. You haven't wasted your time. Have they taken any decision? It seems so. The Royal Council usually raises objections to the intervention of the Holy Office. At Pamplona it is considered Tribunal of Exception without any jurisdiction on matters of the kingdom. Despite it all, they have come to an agreement and an Inquisitor will soon arrive to town, with the mission of investigating all about the witches. What do you want, Juan? I want you to give shelter to my children. Your children? I want them to sleep under the protection of the monastery. Why? What are you afraid of? I don't want them to be taken by the witches, Father. At night, they enter our houses through the chimney, and they take them away flying through the air. I... have put them on some of my own shirts and bags with words from the Gospel and rue and celery leaves to protect them. But I'm afraid they'll take them anyway. But they won't dare enter the monastery. Hey, Antx鏮 you, who know about everything. Who's that Friar? Welcome, Lord of Arezu. We were wondering who could be that rider just arrived. It's an Inquisitor. And what's that? An Inquisitor is a judge. An special judge who prosecutes heretics and witches. I want to speak with you. As you wish. We can go in there. Have you seen that? What were they carrying in there? Hey, you! Help me get this thing down! What's that? What is it for? You'll know it soon. I want to thank you, Lord of Andueza, you're zeal in the defense of the purity of Catholic Faith. It's a pity you only sent your briefing to the Royal Council. We are from Navarra, the Royal Council is our supreme organ of justice. It wasn't my intention to offend you. You people in this land are famous for your independence but I'm sure I can count with your help. You'll have it. Of this you can be sure. If there's anything that unites us Navarrans with you Castillians, it's Catholic Faith. Aswell as King Felipe, who is also king of your kingdom. We won't be hindered by anything in our attempt to defend it. And what do you say? I already know Don Ferm璯's opinon and the Parish Priest's. As the Prior of a monastery, that according to my briefings, locals fervently follow, you must have something to say about this problem In this lands, we've always heard people talk about witches. Of latel, indeed, gossip and murmurs have increased. Yes, indeed. And confessions, don't you forget it, Friar Miguel. And confessions, too. Anyway, I think the problem has been exaggerated. Our people are quite peculiar. They still keep a lot of their ancient customs. But they are good christians. According to my briefings, they don't seem to be so. Where are you from? I was born in Villa Beta a Burgalese village, but I studied in Alcal? Those are far off lands. In my youth I knew Alcal? A brilliant city, its name is Arabian, if I'm not wrong. You're not wrong. The names of our villages and cities are all Basque. I don't have 'converts' as in Castille or Arag鏮. We don't need certificates here. Nor special courts. Are you refusing to be a member of the court? I can't refuse. You know it well. I obey Rome. And Rome has given you powers to investigate in all of Spain's kingdoms. Then, everything's in order. This very morning we'll begin to work. By the way, we'll need a scribe. A man dedicated to take note of the declarations. I have such a man. Juan of Arezu, my administrator. He's the right man for this duty. Thank you, Don Ferm璯. I think we can retire now and rest. An ardous task awaits for us. Do you want to know what an inquisitor is? I'll tell it to you briefly. An inquisitor is a priest, who, with the excuse of defending Catholic faith, dedicates his life to torture people. I know about this because on the other side of the border there was one known as Pier, whose cruelty had no limits. Garazi's grandmother knew him well. It was him who condemned her to die at the stake. And do you think this inquisitor will be like the one you mention? All of them are the same. Tonight the full moon doesn't shine in the sky. Nor is it Saturday. We're gathered here because evil has arrived into this valley. And to show we are not afraid of that inquisitor and his torture machines. Of course we're not afraid! But nevertheless we must be prepared. We will be. But tonight we must be happy. Mari will be listening. And she will protect us. Tonight we must be happier than ever. The Time of the Lord has arrived! God will triumph over Satan, and warlocks and witches will disappear! Repent! The Sacred Wrath of Christ will fall upon those who refuse to come and declare what they know! Anyone who knows about the identity of a witch has the duty to denounce her to the Holy Inquisition! You have to give us their names! We have to fight together so that the witches in this town will be annihilated by the faith of the Holy Catholic Church! All must colaborate! Colaborate with the Holy Tribunal and this way, put an end to this evil! Those who are not witches must come with the procession of the Holy Church! Let's go back to the House of God to ask for His mercy. God is with us! Good morning. It's not necessary you put the apron on. You're not working here anymore. Why? Am I doing anything wrong? No.. it's no that. It's... you'll see... You know there's not much work here... and the profit is not abundant... I've been thinking that my wife and I are more than enough for this business. It's not necessary to lie. You won't make up for anything saying these things. We both perfectly know why you're firing me. Next! Hello, Ram鏮! Come in, come in! Sit down. Let's see. Do you know if there are any witches in this town? Yes, there are many witches in this town. Is it true that those witches and warlocks use to... gather at night in caves to celebrate their sacrilegious ceremonies? Yes. The firewod is running out. Unai, why don't you go outside and bring a few dry branches, huh? Yes, I'll go right away. There's something I wanted to tell you. And I think it's better Unai doesn't hear about this. Inigo was here the other day. What did he wanted? A brew. I got what I could from him. She's still in love with you, Garazi. I know. He doesn't leave me alone. And what does Unai say? You know he knows the story. But I prefer not to tell him he's still bothering me. He could confront him. And I can suffice myself to defend me from Inigo. You've changed so much! I still remember when you arrived here with your mother asking for help. Those were other days. You were still a child. You had a sad look in your eyes. A scared look. I'm so glad you're now such a strong and brave woman. Like your grandmother was. And I'm glad I've taught you so many things. Wait a moment. Here. What is it? Something quite ancient. My mother gave it me, in case I married. She got it from my grandmother. But I never married. And I won't either, for the time being. And I don't know if I ever will. But you can do it. I can't anymore. I'm far too old. I got little time left. When I'm gone, someone will have to take my place. I would like it to be you. Carry it always close to your heart. Thank you. I'll always carry it with me. Besides the firewood I've brought some visits, I've found him outside. Good evening. Hello, Garazi. I've heard about what that Antx鏮 pig has done to you. I'm glad you're here. We have to talk. Let's have a seat. Do you know what's happening in town? Many neighbors are declaring before the tribunal. It seems people tells incredible things in there. They say the detentions will start soon. For the time being they've started leaving me without a job. And what can we do? From now one we must be very careful with our reunions. Yes, people make up much nonsense, too much nonsense about our meetings. We've been curing illnesses for centuries, helping people. We've always been able to meet without any problem. And celebrate our rites. And suddenly, those who before this wanted to be healed, now denounce us. And those who asked for our help, now arrest us. What will become of us? No, don't come in tonight. Mother is not well. And I still have to tell her about the job. I'd rather do it alone. Why don't you also tell her we're getting married? You promised you'd think about it. Besides, what are you going to do now without a job? I don't know. I think that would bring about complications. You're too many. And I'm not sure Unai. Give me a little more time. Even more time? I don't want to hurt anyone. Least of all to you. You can't hurt me. Yes I can, Unai. Sometimes I think there's a curse upon me. And that's the reason I only bring disgrace wherever I go. Don't talk nonsense. I need you, Garazi. I need you. Not me nor my wife, have ever been in any akelarre. That's the reason why we can't tell you many things. It's just what people say. But they say that, besides worshiping the Devil at their meetings they also do harm to the land. And what else? You must tell everything you know to the Tribunal. They say that, following orders form the Devil, they make poisons and powders to pour over the fruit, and making them go bad that way. But we don't know nothing. Only what people say around. And names? Why don't you give us any names? We need names, not theories. Do you know about someone in town who is a witch? Garazi. Garazi of Otxoa. Mother. How was your night? So, so. I have had some very strange dreams. Come on, take a little soup. Just a little. I don't want it. You have to take it all, yesterday you ate very little. Don't you hear? Someone's coming. I don't hear anything. Yes. I hear footsteps. Go and see. Go. I can't see anyone. Yes, they're coming to the farmhouse! Calm down, mother, no one's coming. So terrible were your dreams? Yes, many of them were coming. All were people we know, people around, and they spat at me, and they insulted me. They beat me, and I couldn't move. And wasn't I here to defend you? No. You weren't here Don't worry anymore mother. Garazi of Otxoa, hurry up in the name of the Holy Inquisition. She must be a witch. What are you looking for? Is this what you wanted? You're wrong. I don't like seeing you like this. I've come to help you. "Help me." What do you want for in exchange? I've talked to my father. If you want to everything can be fixed in a few days. You only have to collaborate. Don't deny anything. And repent for being a witch. Go, Inigo. Go and tell your father I don't have any plans to follow your advice! You'll regret it if you don't do what I tell you. Leave me alone! (Where are you going?) (I want to come in.) (You can't come in.) (I have to come in!) (You can't!) (Let me in!) (Halt!) (Let me in!) (I've told you you can't come in!) GARAZI! UNAI! What happens? Let go, swine, let go! Where's Garazi? What have you done to her? She's been accused of being a witch. Well you know that's a lie, bastard! Release him! I can deal with him by myself. Subdue that man! You have to learn to fight better, son. Take him out of here, throw him into the road! UNAI! I have asked for a dozen. It's more precise than the ones your soldiers carry. I hope they send them soon. You can keep this one. It's yours. You have to get used to be a good Andueza. I already am, father. And I'm proud of it. I have seen you fight that Unai. Listen... don't you think a person that is somehow related to a witch is quite probably a witch himself. Do you really think Garazi is a witch? It was the Tribunal who ordered her arrest... ...not me. Many people have testified against her. But she didn't seem... People can decieve us sometimes, my son. Behind an innocent face, a great evil may be hiding. If they prove she's a witch, what will happen? The stake. And sometimes they turn into pigs, goats, lamb, mares, and others animals in order to do evil things. And sometimes, as in St. Jhon's Eve, after their ceremonies are over the Devil takes all the witches into a church, and opens the door so that they can enter and insult the Holy Cross and the images of the Saints. What's your name? Garazi of Otxoa. How old are you? Twenty. Listen, girl... many testimonies have been presented before this tribunal, similar to the one Juan de Arezu has just read . It seem the activities of the witches in this town is public, and known by all. Do you know anything about this? No. Are you sure? Yes. We also have othe statements that point directly at you. They affirm you're a witch! That's a lie! No, it's not. We know it's true. But you're still on time, confess now by your own will, repent and ask for forgiveness to the Church. Tell us the names of other witches you know and you may escape the stake. No! It's not true. I am no witch, and have never been. Those are false testimonies. And why would the witnesses want to harm you? I don't know. I repeat, right now you have an opportunity, but it won't last forever. Cooperate with this Tribunal, tell us who the witches on this village are... and you'll have nothing to fear. I have nothing to tell you. I don't know no witch. You, Don 聲gel, know her well, and may be able to convice her more easily. You have heard what the Inquisitor has said. Thera are several witnesses that affirm you're a witch. Admit it, and nothing will happen to you. It's not true. It's not true. They are best inhabitants in this town, and you are you calling them liars? The only one lying in here is you. If you don't admit it you'll end up like your grandmother! Or is it also a lie that your grandmother was a witch? That she was condemned to the stake by a French Tribunal? She was innocent. A neighbour of hers falsely accused her. Oh, yes? And why did your mother runaway with you? Why did you have to stablish yourselves in this town? Because we were afraid. Afraid of what? Christ's Truth does not lead to fear. You came to a calm place, because you thought here you could serve the Devil with ease. But the hour of the Crucified One has come also to this land. And all your lies and tricks will be of no use now. We know you're a witch, you have to confess! That's a lie. THAT'S A LIE! Do you realize? They're stubborn, hardheaded, they refuse to cooperate. Think, Garazi, everything's against you. It's true that several witnesses have accused you. Besides, the Holy Office can submit the accused to torment in order to make them talk. Tell us all you know, if anything. And you will avoid great sufferings. All of this is a lie. I'M NOT A WITCH! EVERYTHING YOU SAY IS A LIE! Why would you have me accuse other people? I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING! Enough with this nonsense, girl! Evil seals your mouth. But we know how open it. What do you want? I WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU DID IT! Why I did what? You know it very well, you scoundrel! Tell me how you met with Arezu! That's the way they give you orders! I don't know what you're talking about. You knew they were going to arrest her, you're their henchman. I'm not anyone's henchman. Then go and declare in Garazi's favor. You know better than anyone she's innocent. I don't want to get mixed up in that. If they say she's a witch... ...surely there's a reason. I don't know anything, I fired her because I didn't needed her, my wife and I can take care of this. I don't have to explain to you how I run my business, I can do anything I want in my house. What you want or what Don Ferm璯 wants? Be careful. If anything happens to Garazi, you'll regret it, I swear it. What was that? Nothing, it was nothing. How come? And why do you look so afraid? I've said it was nothing! It's bad! It's gone sour! And this one too! It cannot be! It's fresh wine! Oh my God! It was them! But who? Who are they? The witches! Wretch daughter of Evil, why do you refuse to take refuge in the goodness of Christ our Saviour. Don't you realize? We could submit you to torments much more painful yet. Make a gesture at least. Nod at least. And you'll be free form this torture. No. Ushua! Ushua, what have they done to you? What have they done to you? Many have come, and they've beaten me. Don't talk, I'll take care of you. I'm going to... I'm going to die. Where's Garazi? She will come soon,don't worry. Don't worry. I don't want to go Hell, I don't want to. I'm afraid of the fire. You won't go to Hell, you've always been a good person Ushua. (Please.) Please, I want to confess. Bring Don 聲gel. I don't want to go to Hell. I don't want to go. Go, Neco, you may leave. Are you afraid that a child may listen what we're going to talk? No, but his work is done here. I've told you to leave! Whats business brings you here? What is it that has forced you to step into this church for the first time? I have come to ask burial for a dead woman. Who's that dead woman who needs the help of a miscreant? Haven't you heard yet? Weren't your own parishioners, egged on by your sermons, who have killed Ushua of Otxoa? Finish quickly, so that you defile the House of God no more. I've said it already, I want Ushua of Otxoa to be buried. A daughter and mother of witch can never be buried beneath sacred grounds. Ushua wasn't a witch. And neither is Garazi. She hasn't confessed yet, but the Lord is sronger than Satan and truth will shine in the end. Who told you then? Don Ferm璯? Your true Lord? The entire town knows it. This town knows whatever the Lord of Andueza wants them to know. But perhaps you should know a few other things aswell. Things that have been a secret until now. What do you mean? Have you forgotten who looked after Mar燰 Oteiza in her labor. She told me everything about it. But you took her way so that no one would know it was your own bastard son. Shut up, you blasphemous woman! You don't know what you're talking about! Kneel before the Crucified One, and ask for forgiveness. It is you who must ask for forgiveness. Despite your masses and your prayers, you'll end up in that Hell you threaten people with. There, these flesh, well fattened by don Ferm璯, will burn for centuries. Get away from me, don't touch me you sacrilegious woman. Go away! Yes. I'll leave now. I just wanted to keep the last will of a Christian woman. You're young and beautiful. Why are you so eager to die? Why would you rather suffer these torments, than confess? If you cooperate with this Holy Tribunal, you may save your life. Don't you understand? I know nothing. I'm not a witch. And what is this? Are you going to tell me this is a crucifix? You still have an opportunity, talk! Say yes, and it will be enough. NOOOO! My God, forgive me! Are you well, Friar Miguel? Yes, yes. It's been only a momentary ailment. You must take care of your health, you look paler and more dejected everyday. I know Cistercian rule is tough, but I thought you were even tougher. No, no you're wrong. My health is well. You're losing heart, perhaps? Maybe I shouldn't, but I want to be honest with you. Speak without fear, I'll listen. I didn't ignore your methods were rigorous... But witnessing this torments is crueler than I ever imagined. Christ will give you strength, have trust in Him. Is... is it necessary for all three members of this Tribunal to attend these torments? Excuse my weakness... but, if it doesn't matter much I'd rather... I understand Friar Miguel. It is not necessary for you to go on. Do you want to lead these poor ignorant peasants into the heart of the Church? But you only use words, and the Devil is strong. And in order to confront him, words are not enough. You misunderstand. You may do as you please. As long as you sign the corresponding records, of course. Of course. Of course. Ushua of Otxoa. Let your spirit escape from its bindings. Let it fly through the sky. To find Mari's fiery charriot. And be taken to Heaven forever. Let your spirit go out Ushua. May your mortal body, come back to Mother Earth, from whence it came. They've managed to deceive people. Now they believe the bad harvest, the plague, the illnesses, even the dead animals are our fault. What can we do? I'm leaving for France with my children. Don't think you'll be safer there. We could talk with Friar Miguel, he's always helped us, we must not forget the Monastery and the Lordship don't share interests. It will be better to consider it before doing anything, Friar Miguel is also a member of the tribunal. He's a Churchman, and he can't refuse. And what good will do talking to him? What we must do is talk to the informers, to that traitor landlord. And why with Antx鏮? Because it was him who denounced Garazi. Calm down, Unai, the only thing we're sure of is that he fired her from her job. He denounced her also, I'm sure. And if you're not willing to do anything, I'll do it myself. We understand your pain, Unai. And you're not the only one in pain for Garazi's detention. It brings sorrow to us all. But Lander is right, the situation is too dire for us to start accusing any people without proof. We'll know in time if it was Antx鏮 who denounced Garazi. Nevertheless, I know for sure of some people who did accused her. What are you doing Mar燰, now they'll see the smoke. But they won't see us, I told you they would come. Well, we won't open the door. Open up, we only want to talk! Don't be afraid! It's useless, we're only wasting our time. Open up, we won't harm you! Don't insist, it will be better to leave. We'll be back in the morning. Wait a minute, they'll see. Filthy pigs, you sold out! The witches came. And they wanted to enter the house through the chimney, but the smoke stopped them. They destroyed the orchard, those were the few things we had to feed ourselves. My Lord, what will we eat now? You must not worry at all. We'll protect you. Now calm down and wait, we'll let you know when we need your declarations. The witches had taken their masks off. Confess. Confess at once and we're done. Admit you're a witch and repent! Confess or we'll tear your soul apart. Yes. Yes. Yes. You may start writing, Arezu. Yes. Yes. I thought you weren't coming. Well you were wrong, give me the keys. You'll know nothing about this, understood? Uh-huh. Who is this? No. No. No. Take your hands off of me. Antx鏮, what are you doing? Open up! Here he is. What's up? Hello. Hello. Did anyone see you coming? I don't think so. That's better. It's not convenient they know about me, if I continue as soldier in palace I may find out many more things. Be careful anyway. We got to find out a way to contact you without putting you in any danger. Don't you think, Unai? Uh-huh. I'll take care of that. We shepherds can move around without raising any suspicions. Unai and me have decided not to go back to our homes. We'll take to the hills. Have you spoken with the others? Yes, we'll keep on with our normal lives. It seems the trials are going fast, Don Ferm璯 wants to end this as soon as posible. Do you know anything about Amunia or Garazi? Garazi hasn't come out frome her cell for days. They barely feed her, but they've left her alone. I don't know much about Amunia, she's well guarded. And one more thing, Unai... What? I don't know if I should tell you about this... Tell me. It's about Inigo. I've heard that some nights, when everyone's asleep she goes to Garazi's cell and locks himself up with her. How long are going to put up with this? How was your night? I felt you rolling in bed. How can I sleep if it is by night that they go to the houses? You must calm down, Antx鏮. Nobody's going to do us any harm. Have you heard that? Have you... They're after me. Can't you see? They've killed her. And I'm next. They want to ruin me. But you've done nothing. Why would they come after you? It was me who denounced Garazi. Yes, it was me. That's why they're coming after me. Oh My God! And the so called Amunia of Baxterretxea came to my house while I was sleeping and she put some black-green, foul smelling water all over my skin and then she took me by air to the Akelarre where the Devil celebrated his Mass. And Amunia presented me to him saying: "My Lord... I bring this young woman before you..." Pardon for the interruption... but I think this woman's declarations may be very valuable. The Tribunals proceedings are secret Lord of Andueza. You may not interrupt us without previous notice. I know, I know Friar Miguel. Don Ferm璯, do you think that what this woman may tell is really important? It seems the witches are after her husband. When we're done we'll take her declaration. I'm sorry to have bothered you so much with my presence here. You may go on. "After the Devil finished Mass, he took us all carnally, men and women. And the mentioned Amunia of Baxterretxea, Queen of the Akelarre, was appointing the witches who should go where the Devil was. That way, the Devil attended carnally to all women, through both ways. And the witches mingled with each other, men and women, and also men with men, without having in consideration social stature or blood relations. What have you to say about this? Are you going to keep denying it? It's all a lie. I have never attended meetings with the Devil. You're stubborn. Haven't you had enough with all the testimonies we've gathered? It's all fake. I have witnesses that speak to the contrary. But God is merciful, and He may forgive you if you show repentance. Is it the Devil who puts in you such a false humility? Did you drank so humbly the blood of children? I have never done such a thing, it's all a lie. Lie, you say? Listen to another declaration: "Many times, Amunia of Baxterretxea, came to indoctrinate me and make a witch of me, like her. One of those evenings, she explained to me that the Devil commands the witches to drink the blood of little children And she told me that in order to do it one must suck it through the skull and the pudenda squeezing hard with our hands and sucking fiercely because the blood of the children is good for the bodies of the witches. No.. Oh, God! Let not your sinner lips pronounce the Sacred Name of God! The Devils has taken a hold on your will and won't let you confess. Let the witness in! She may come in. Garazi of Otxoa... You have acknowledged you're a witch. I don't know if your belated confession wil save you from the bonfire. But you may avoid the Eternal Fire of Hell if you colaborate with this tribunal. Do you recognize this woman? Yes. What's her name? Amunia of Baxterretxea Have you seen this woman in any of the akelarres you've acknowledged you've attended? Aren't you going to answer? Haven't you declared she was the Queen of the Akelarres? Yes. Forgive me. What have you done to her to get her confession? And you call youselves Men of God? Who is that God in whose name you torture? Silence, blasphemer! Don't you realize what you say? Don't you know we could condemn you just for that? You wretched woman! What do you want me to say? What do you want me to confess? Do you want me to lie? I want you to tell the truth. I want you tell you're the Master of the Witches, that you serve the Devil, and the sacrilegous feast you celebrate... Do you want me to tell the truth? Well, listen. All those you've said about me are lies. I don't worship the Devil nor do any of that nonsense. I simply heal the sick. And I also, sometimes, gather with my friends at the cave. Yes! Does it perplex you? Where do you want us to have gatherings? Aren't there caves in your homeland? Here, until you came and built churches, we've always gone to the caves. Do you see Friar Miguel? They're atheist, pagans, that woman is the Antichrist. Shut up, scoundrel! Or do you want me to tell the things I know about you? Yes! When there's a full moon we go into the cave. There we talk. We drink beverages we prepare with herbs from our forests. And that way we keep awake trough the night, happy. Singing, dacing, following the customs of our ancestors. And what are those customs? What antichristian customs? But tell the truth, is it the Devil who presides over your gatherings? The Devil? Have you ever seen the Devil? How does he look like? I've never seen him. He has never gone to our gatherings, as you say. Then, what is it that you do? Or is it also a lie that you smooch like animals? NO! We don't smooch like animals. We do it like people. Or is it that when you "smooch," you do it with an animal? Or ask that priest how does he "smooch"? Hasn't he ever told you? Silence, blasphemer! Do not offend a servant of Christ! Whose servant? Isn't he a servant of Don Ferm璯? Or of King Felipe, like you? TAKE HER AWAY! TAKE HER AWAY! You will confess, you damned woman! You will confess the whole truth! Antx鏮? Antx鏮, are you there? ANTX粍! ANTX粍! ANTX粍! The witches have killed my husband! Yes... Release her. Do you have this woman's confession? Yes. Except for the tavern owner's business. Add, then, what follows: "In addition to what was refered before, where the accused, Amunia of Baxterretxea, acknowledges she is the Master and Queen of the witches of this locality, The accused also confesses that, on September 3, when she was led by the soldiers to her cell, when she passed the tavern she saw the owner, and the Devil told her, in such a way the she only was able to hear Him, to curse the man. And so she did. And the next day, from her cell she made a diabolic spell cuasing with it the death of the taverner Antx鏮 of Otxandiano. Do you agree? Yes... Oh, Garazi... Garazi... Jon, the soldier says that they consider you lost. The truth is, when thay started to detain so many people we were afraid. And for 2 days and 2 nights, the entire town was trembling and no one dared to go out. But all of a sudden the detentions stopped and they even released some people. What people's been saying now is that they're taking the prisoners away. Where? Some say they're taking them to Pamplona; others say, to Tudela. I don't know. Anyways, if somethings comes up Jon will know about it, we can rest assured. I think they're taking them to Logro隳. Why to Logro隳? A few months ago, a stockbreeder from Estalla came to this town. Many Jews live in that region, and they worry about this kind of business. He told us that people who had problems with the Inquisition were always taken to Logro隳. What are you thinking? I'm not sure. The only think I know is we got to do something. You, Aimar, go to the farmhouses and see if there's still people willing to help us. And tell Jon to be watchful of anything that happens. All right. Now I have to leave. How are you managing with the food? Pretty well. There's plenty of game around here, the other day we almost caught a wild boar. At the time some soldiers were coming down the road and we had to let him escape. Next time I'll bring you fresh milk. Good bye, Aimar. We wish you good luck. Take care. It's a pity Friar Miguel rejected your invitation, Don Ferm璯. The prior is a frugal man. The few times I've seen him eat he barely had a bite. Well, that's regrettable. I admit you have fine food in this land. The pleasure of fine dining is the less sinful of all pleasures. It even kills other desires. You speak the truth. Altough it is advisable to guard ourselves at the table also, and avoid abusing. I hope the witches won't come to this town anymore. You may rest assured, they won't come back. Lord of Arezu... Tell me, do you have the exact numbers I asked you this afternoon? Certainly, your Excellency. "Of 253 inhabitants in this town, 110 have rendered voluntary declarations 30 were called to declare, and 23 have detained and incarcerated. Of these, 11 have acknowledged they've been witches for a long time and one, that she was Queen of the Akelarre and Master fo the rest. You've performed an excellent work, Attorney Acevedo. Altough the most dangerous among them have escaped. They've been accused by the tribunal. They won't dare coming back, they better not. What have you thought about the transferal? You were right about what you told me this morning. This house... is not a good place to retain so many prisoners for long. One of them's deceased, already. It may not be the only one. If you wish, I may send a messenger to ask for guards from the Holy Office. It won't be necessary. We can suffice ourselves. For the good end of our task. May good forgive me if I've been a coward. Let's hope in Logro隳 they're fairer with the detainees. Do you remember the day the first peasant came with his children? Now practically all the children in town sleep at the monastery. Until when? They will take them soon. What happens? Calm down, it's nothing. Have you had bad dreams? I've been with Amunia. What are you saying? Yes, she came while I was sleeping and took me through the air, to a cave where there were more witches. We were there for a while, and after that we kept flying. For a long time. I didn't want to come back, but Amunia told me it was better this way. She told me there will be other nights. She escaped through the window. Didn't you see her? Well, calm down. And go back to sleep. Is Amunia evil? Calm down, calm down. Go back to sleep. And don't pay attention to dreams. Out! Out! Hurry up! Go criminals! Good morning, father. I've been told you were looking for me. Yes, son, yes. Your mother would be happy if she saw you in a day like today. And I'm sure the daughter of the Ab嫫zuza would also be glad to see you. The daughter of the Ab嫫zuza? But... if I remember correctly... she's older than me. And what does it matter, son? I got plans for you. Years weight on me... and loneliness also weights. It shoots its ghost upon me more frequently each time. After harsh struggle I've managed this town to start to live in peace. Free from the witches. Now it's your turn. During our travel you'll have time to think about Blanca of Ab嫫zuza. But father, Blanca of Ab嫫zuza is... My decision is final. A wife badly chosen, is an error without repair and marks you for a lifetime, my son. I haven't chosen thoughtlessly. The daughter of the Ab嫫zuza is older than you. Indeed. But she's a good woman. And not without charm. Besides... she's an only daughter. There are not many girls in such conditions around here. You won't lack ocassion for furtive loves. I didn't mean to go against your opinion, father. Go with God, Don Inigo. Let's go! The bells call to Mass. Today, the entire congregation will attend. You'll have a fine opportunity to illuminate everyone with the word of God, without any witches left. It's a pity I can't stay. I had the idea you were to stay a few days making us company. Yes, that was my intention. But, unfortunately, a new source of witchcraft has been denounced in coastal lands and I'm must depart without further delay. I hope you may accept our invitation some other time. When your task is over, maybe. Here you will always be welcome, of that you may be sure. I am, Don Ferm璯. I must leave. May you have a pleasant journey. I'll be praying for you, Excellency. God be with you. Whoa! Go back to town and tell them about this! Release the others! Hurry up! Unai. Go now! Get out of here, hurry! The Devil managed to establish his dominion in this town. But the Lord Our God... in his infinite mercy has defeated the Devil. And, his servants, the witches. You've been a witness to it. Right now, the witches of this town are on their way to Logro隳. Where they will be judged and condemned. The bonfire awaits for many of them. And, why all this? Because they listened to the words of the enemies of the Holy Catholic Church. The poisoned words of the insidious. Of the witches. Of the heretics. Of the blasphemers. So I tell you, you must always be watchful. Always on guard. THE WITCHES! THE WITCHES HAVE ATTACKED! Call the soldiers and get my horse ready! They attacked us by surprise, sir. And they outnumbered us. Inigo was killed by treachery. Two of them also died. The other managed to release the chain gang. Throw him into ravine to be fodder of the vultures. Damn you! You be damned! Why don't you throw to the vultures the body of your heir? He's of no use to you now. And throw yourself into the void, after him. You're nothing more than offal! You'll pay for this, you damn witch. YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS! (Prayers in Latin) Where are you going? We haven't finished, yet. Sir, I understand your suffering, but I think it goes againts the interest of the Church to.. I AM THE BOSS IN HERE! She's turned into a bird! Subtitles by Fredegis.
