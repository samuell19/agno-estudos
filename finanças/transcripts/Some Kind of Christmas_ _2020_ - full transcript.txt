What services can I get you started with this morning? - Good job. - Thank you. (phone ringing) I know! I know! I mean, who would've ever thought I would've had to bury my goldfish. Who even knew that fish could drown! I just feel your pain, I'm so sorry! - Do you have to be that dramatic? - It works every time. Absolutely, we can bury him in our finest pup suit. - You know, you have really great numbers this month. Keep up the great work. - Florals? Oh, of course. - Baby, when I get off, I'm gonna put this meat down- (Gary clearing throat) So yes, by choosing Carol's Crematory you'd be expanding Fido's final moments to endless possibilities. I'm gonna send you a quote to the email you provided on your profile. Baby, I gotta call you back. I gotta go, damn. - Rashawn, get in my office! - Gary, can I see you in my office, please? - [Gary] Okay, just give me a few minutes. I'll be there. - Now. Come on in. Have a seat. - [Gary] You wanted to see me? - Yes, how are things goin'? How are things out on the floor? - Oh, things are good. It's productive out there. - Well, as you know it's just a few days before Christmas, and for the first time in five years of being employed here, I am being told that you've asked for the holiday off. - Yes, I have. It's been a very long time since I've been in the Christmas spirit. - Is that so? Well, do you have any big plans? - Actually, I do. See, my parents have this huge Christmas celebration every year that I never attend. This year I finally decided that I would go. - Well, I just love Christmas! But before you leave, I am going to need all of the week's numbers on my desk. - Oh, okay. Sure, no problem. - Oh, I wasn't finished. - My apologies. - Now, seeing as how we're so close to the end of the year, I am going to need reviews on all of the employees on the floor so that I can start preparing for raises. - Okay. - If any. And I'm gonna need projections on next year's financial analysis. This pandemic has really done a number on us. Oh, and lastly. If you would be ever so kind and make sure that all the employee's information is updated on the Rolodex, I want to start sending out W2s. You know how important taxes are to you people. (Gary clearing throat) - You people? (Carol chuckling) Got it. So you wait until I decide to take my first vacation to give me all of this work? - Did I do something wrong? - No, no, you didn't do anything wrong. You did everything right, Karen. - Excuse me? - I'll make sure this is completed. - Well, I know you will. Well, that's all I have for you. Do you have anything for me? - Merry Christmas. (Carol chuckling) - And Gary, go check the furnace. It's making a funny noise. We got a lot of puppies to burn up this afternoon. - [Gary] Roger. - You little Bambi. I love you. (smooching) (Gary sighing) - Friend, I thought you were sent to the principal's office. - She is such a bitch. A miserable bitch. I finally decided to get into the Christmas spirit and take a vacation, and here she comes with all this work. She's so draining. - Let me guess. She wants you to revamp and organize the entire company by, um, five o'clock yesterday. - How'd you guess? - That chick is a one-trick pony. She does it every year. She did it to the last VP that was here before you. It's like if the Grinch was an actual person on a mission to actually steal Christmas, it'd be her, hairy back and all. (Gary sighing) - Who does that? - Now, friend, I ain't messy and I don't gossip, but sources say that allegedly what happened was and the word on the street is that she ain't got no family or friends, so she wrapped herself up in this business that we funna be wrapped up in this business with her. I think not. - She's such a witch. - Tell me about it. But you don't have anything to worry about 'cause I'll cover you. - Wait, you will? - Yeah, I do it every other year for every other VP. And isn't this you and Darryl's anniversary anyway? - Actually, it's today. Thank you. Thank you for asking. - Oh, I love love. Happy anniversary. But you know it's gonna cost you, though, right? - Okay, here we go. I knew it. How much? Name your price. - There is a pandemic, all right? I would never take your hard earned money. Send me the news. (Gary coughing and choking) - What, bitch? - You can say what, bitch. You can say yes, bitch. The news. - Mine or his? - Since you asked, both, bitch, and make it nasty. I want every angle, videos, pictures, make ya wink, make ya jump, make it... (Gary laughing) - You know what? If I didn't need to catch this flight, I wouldn't be sitting her having such a lascivious conversation with you. - Oh, where are we goin'? - Well, I bought two tickets to South Africa that he doesn't know about. But before that, we're gonna go down to Atlanta to spend Christmas with my parents. - South Africa? I can't even get a man to take me to a free COVID test and he's goin' to South Africa? That's a lucky man. Listen, friend, make sure you got a lot of masks, gloves, and hand sanitizer. It's real out there. - Well, you do know one year's a long time with the world clock of the gays. So I decided I would go all out for this milestone. And don't worry, I have a new order of PPE equipment comin' in. - Okay, 'cause one year is a long time on anybody's clock. And it's hard to find a faithful man, and if you do, he's either wrapped up on social media or got the attention span of a damn fruit fly. But that's okay. I'll be at home relaxing, ordering takeout, and scrolling the Ken app lookin' for me a husband. - What's that? - A husband or the Ken app? - The app! - Oh, just an app for people who can't find a man. Helps you build a perfect man. Any weight, any age, any height, any size. I'm surprised you never heard of it. You know, the kids love a good app. - No, I've never heard of it. Damn. So they make an app for almost everything these days, huh? - Mmm-hmm. - But come on. I'm sorry, but it possibly can't be that bad for you. - Shit, yes it can. But this isn't about me. This is about you. You have a flight to catch, so get out of here. Have fun. Be safe. And above all, ride that dick like a- - Alano! Shh! You're so embarrassing. - What? Listen, when you get off that dick I want him to feel like you rolled some of the skin off. - Ooh, well, first of all that would insinuate that I'm dry and that's not the case over here. My pH balance is on 10. - Alkaline, bitch? - Ooh, okay, well take that alkaline up out of here and Merry Christmas. And listen, hopefully one of those animals that she buried will come back and burn this bitch down. And don't forget my news, either.

You can thank your father for this one. - No way. So Pops told you? See if I ever tell him anything again. - Oh Gary, I am so excited. I cannot wait to see you. And your brother and his family, his wife and kids, they're coming as well. - I kind of figured he would be there. Doesn't he come every year? - He does. He does. But that doesn't mean I don't get just as excited when he confirms his presence. And I get to see my grandkids. (clearing throat) My grandkids. I don't want to beat a dead horse, Gary, with the whole family conversation. But it's just that I get so worried about you being down in Miami all by yourself. - Ma, who says I'm alone and by myself? Just because you haven't seen me show up to your doorstep with a bun in the oven or pushing the stroller does not mean that I'm alone. We all have our own versions of family, you know. - Ooh! Well, shut me up then. So does this mean that you're not coming alone this year? - Now I didn't say all that. Besides, I may just surprise you. - Ooh, all sookie sookie now. It's gonna be the best Christmas ever, and I've got it all planned out. So it would be great if you could be here by Friday at 6:00pm. The first activity starts at 7:00pm sharp. Oh Gary, I'm so excited. I cannot wait. So let me go. I need to go start on my turkey. - Mom. The turkey? - Yes. - It's two days before Christmas. - I know. - Ah, I never understand why people start cooking Christmas dinner five days before. - But you've had my turkey before. So how do you think I make it so moist and tender and juicy and flavorful? It's a process, and I have to start it now, right now today. - It's probably not gonna be that good anyway. - Ooh, the lies you tell on your mother. Just despicable, Gary. - Hey, Mom, I have to call you back. I have another phone call. Can you kiss Pops for me and tell him that he talks too much? But I'll see you both tomorrow, okay? I love you. - And you take care. Be safe. Love you. - Happy anniversary, baby. I just got off the phone with my mother and she's so excited. I'm so nervous. She has no idea that you're coming home with me. Maybe it'd finally just shut her up. She's always bragging about your brother this and brother's wife that, and your brother's kids, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm just so sick of it. What time are you coming home? (somber music) I'm sorry. What? ♪ Whenever you're out of town ♪ ♪ Hold me with arms now ♪ ♪ Loneliness knows this place ♪ - Okay, so what happened now? - Not only did he dump me on my anniversary, it's just two days before Christmas. I knew I should've just stuck with my own tradition and not celebrated Christmas at all, and none of this would be happening right now. - Damn. And it's right before Christmas. That's selfish. - Yeah, very selfish. - So what did you do? Did you two have like a fight or an argument or something? - No, nothing. Everything was fine. It was like a normal day. We got up, we got dressed. We said our love yous. We hugged and kissed. His clothes are still up in the closet. - Okay, so at what point did you end up in the middle of this here floor? - All I remember him telling me is that he didn't want me anymore and that it was over. Then I blacked out. That's it. - You probably thought about all that money you spent on them high ass South Africa tickets and got lightheaded. Damn, I'm sorry, friend. Did you at least try to call him? - Yeah, I did. Can you believe he blocked me? - Blocked? - Well, I guess we need to pull up to that nigga's job, then don't we? 'Cause it ain't never like a bitch with some hurt feelings, pull up to that nigga's job. Come on! - No, no, no, I'm not doing any of that. - Well then I guess you ain't that hurt then, now are you? I guess that means I ain't getting the news no more. Damn, Darryl! - My life has just been turned upside down in a matter of seconds and you can think about is playing in your little litter box. - First of all, it's not a litter box. It's a little garage. Secondly, I ain't gonna be rude or nothin' like that, but your life ain't the only one that's been interrupted. I had plans. I was about to put that about to work! - Oh, shit! I told my mother Darryl was coming. Now I have to tell her that I just got dumped. I'm just gonna call her and tell her there's been a change of plans. - Give me that. - Give me my phone, Alano. I've gotta tell my mother that I'm not coming anymore. - First thing you gotta to do is hang that phone up. Christmas is just a day. I mean, aren't you supposed to be in the Christmas spirit anyway? Yes! Yes! No. Okay. Has your family even met Darryl before? - No, I've never taken a man home before. This would've been my first time. - Oh, well in that case, Darryl can be anybody. All you've gotta do is make a few alterations. First thing we're gonna do, we as in you, gonna go in there and pack all that nigga's shit up. Then we'll just log onto the Ken app and find you a Mr. Claus in no time. - No, no, I'm not doing any of that. - [Alano] Why not? - I'm not some desperate charity case who needs to log onto an escorting app to have a man for the holidays. - Oh, is Miss Mama's feeling judgemental? First of all, as my friend, you're sure that I'm a different caliber of gay. I don't do escorting apps. It's very simple. Two people who have nothing to do interact. One person pays for the interaction when it's over. It's that simple. It's not escorting. - I'm not taking a prostitute home to meet my parents, Alano. - You know, sometimes you have to shut up and let a different caliber of gay handle the situation. This is one of those moments. - Oh. - Come on. Okay, height? - [Gary] Doubly tall. - Weight? - About 180, 200 pounds. I like to be picked up sometimes. (clearing throat) - You mean to tell me you want somebody to pick your big a... - Mmm-hmm. - Okay, um. Age? - They've gotta be older. And masculine. You know, masculinity is very important. My family is so conservative. Well, excuse me, my mother thinks she's so conservative. - Okay, so what age is that? - About 40, 45. - Okay. Occupation? - Doctor. Lawyer. Veterinarian? - Okay. Ooh, one more. Size. - Size of what? - Size. - Oh, size of dick. You can check all that on this app? - Yes. - I'll fill that part out later. - Okay. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Credit card, please. - Credit card for what? - Credit card, please. - Why do you need my credit card for? - Mmm-hmm. - Come on, let me see. What's comin' up? - CVV. Expiration. - Can I see? - That's your last name? All right, all done. - [Gary] Can you see 'em? - You'll get a confirmation email. The fee is gonna be $2500. - What? - In cash. It must be paid at the end of the assignment. - $2500? I better be meeting Jesus. - You better be sayin' thank you. I used my discount. And let's not forget, this is last minute and it's a holiday. - Discount? I don't even wanna know. Is this what my life has come down to? Meeting, or, excuse me, creating some gigolo on an app just so I won't be alone for Christmas? Oh, god. - There's an app for it which means people do it all the time. I already sent the address of the hotel you'll be staying at and told him to meet you there at 4:00. - They can be there that soon? - And can and will. 100% satisfaction guaranteed. (Gary laughing) - Well, I would say thank you but I'm just not sure yet. - No need to say thank you. Just send the news. And because you don't know this man, you can make him nasty and disrespectful. (both laughing) - Thank you. - Merry Christmas, friend. And no worries. We'll deal with Darryl's ass when you get back. - We will. (water running) (gentle acoustic music) (knuckles rapping) - Who is this? I didn't order room service. Who is that? Is that him? May I help you? - Are you Gary? - [Gary] I am. Who are you? - I'm Ken. I'm your boyfriend for the weekend. - [Gary] I'm sorry, you must be mistaken. - Ah, I was told that you ordered a Ken. (door slamming) - Oh, I could kill Alano. (knuckles rapping) (phone ringing) - [Alano] Ooh! Hey, friend! You made it in okay? - Don't hey friend me. Alano, who is this adolescent butch queen you sent to my hotel room? - That is not a butch queen. That's the Ken you ordered. - No, that's the Ken you ordered. I said I wanted somebody professional. 40, 45? (knuckles rapping) - Seemed like you wanted a Darryl lookalike, and we see where the first one got you. I spiced it up a little bit. Ain't he fine? - That's beside the point. You know what, I'm gonna get you (indistinct). - Hello? Hello? Friend! Hello? Can you hear me? You better get you an iPhone, 'cause this Android ain't doin' so good for you. Hello? Friend! - Alano! You gonna hang up on me? - I can't hear you! (phone ringing) Bye. Thank you for calling Carol's Crematory. - Alano! Alano! Hey! (knuckles rapping) - Is everything okay? - Yeah, I'm sorry. Pardon my manners. Please come in. I'm Gary. - I'm Ken. You do know it's perfectly fine for you to be nervous, right? I'm used to it. - [Gary] Yeah, maybe that's what it is. I'm not used to just jumping right into things like this. - All right, I got a few ground rules. There are no refunds. - Okay, no refunds. - I require 25% of my final down payment up front. There's no kissing. I'm not sucking your dick. And if you want me to be on the bottom, it needs to already be in your contract. And since it's not, I'm gonna need at least 24-hour notice for dietary reasons. But if this is just about to be about sex, I need all my money now. - Wait, wait, wait. It's not necessary for any of that. Oh, no, I just came from the shower. That's why I have this towel on. I haven't had time to get dressed. I'm not sure how much information they've given you, but I just need you to fill in for my boyfriend. My ex-boyfriend who had decided to dump me yesterday. Yeah. - Two days before Christmas? Damn! - On our anniversary. - Damn! You don't need me. You need two blunts and a double barrel shotgun. (chuckling) So. What's the occasion? - Well, my family has this huge Christmas celebration every year and I decided to get into the Christmas spirit and attend. And just as I got into the spirit, I got my heart broke at the same time. - Well, cheer up, 'cause you're in luck. I'm great at creating memorable moments, and I make a great boyfriend, too. You tell me what you need and I got you. - For starters, we've got to be at my parents house in the next 40 minutes. If I'm a minute late, my mother's gonna have this panic attack. She's always talkin' about things are on schedule and how making every second count. My family's extremely conservative. Well, my mother is anyway. But my father, oh, you'll love my father. - Got it. What else? - Shayla, my sister. She's married to an older man. A much older man. So when we get there, make sure you don't give the normal or reaction when you see him. - What else, sir? - This is the most important piece of the puzzle. My family doesn't know that I'm same gender loving. - You mean your family doesn't know that you're gay? - I'm sure they know it, they just never seen me interact with another man or talk about one before. - Weren't you just about to take a man home for Christmas? - Yeah, I was. But he just wasn't any man. I thought we'd be together forever, which brings me to my next point. My brother, Lonnie. He's an asshole. And he's gonna try to pry. So if anything was to get to my parents, I'd rather for it to come from me. So no talk about how we met on this app or me being dumped, all right? - Got it. Let's go. - Okay, wait, but, aren't you gonna change? - Aren't you gonna change? What's wrong with what I have on? - Okay, it's going to be a long weekend. ♪ Ah, Christmas ♪ ♪ Don't you think that the holidays ♪ ♪ Should be all about love ♪ - For both of us. ♪ More wine by the fireplace ♪ ♪ With the one you're dreaming of ♪ ♪ Why don't we make your Christmas my Christmas ♪ ♪ Our Christmas ♪ - Pop! - Well, look it here.

We hug in this household. - Okay. Your home is beautiful. And it smells delicious in here. Somebody cookin'? - Compliments of the lady of the house. She goes all out every year. - I can tell. - So you live and work in Miami as well? - No. - You here in Atlanta? - Well, my job causes me to travel a lot, so I can end up anywhere depending on my assignment. - Okay, sounds, sounds fancy. So, uh, Gary, you movin' around like that as well? That's why you don't come home anymore? - Oh, no, Dad. Actually, I'm the VP of Carol's Crematory. We offer burial services for animals. The largest in the world, actually. My job keeps me busy, but it's not as glamorous and fancy as Ken's over here. (dishes clattering) - Oh, that's just your mom fumbling around with one of her dishes. Your brother's upstairs unpacking. Your sister hasn't arrived yet. - Oh, well, you know she always has to make this huge, grand entrance when she comes in. - Well, it wouldn't be her if she didn't. - So where are your bags? You two didn't bring a change of clothes? - No, actually, we got a room downtown. - All these rooms we have here and you're stayin' at a hotel? Shame on you. Well, come on. Let's get settled. You got a few minutes before your mother rounds us up like cattle for whatever she has planned. Come on. (door creaking) - Merry Christmas everybody! - Shayla! Finally! - My favorite much older brother! (laughing) - Oh, now watch it, sis. I'm not that much older than you are. - Mmm-hmm, but you are older, right? - [Gary] Mmm-hmm. - Oh, let me get that for you. - Oh, and who do we have here? - This is my friend Ken. - Ken! Okay. Hi, friend. I'm Shayla. This is my husband, Mr. Willie. And this is our beautiful baby girl Ariel. - Like "The Little Mermaid"? - Yes, just like "The Little Mermaid". She's my little mermaid. (chuckling) - It is so nice to finally meet you and your family because your brother Gary talks about you all the time. - He does? And what does he say exactly? Because he sure doesn't answer my Facetime calls when I call him. - Oh, don't do that, sis. You know I'm always at work working. - Mmm-hmm. - And just because you call and I don't answer does not mean I don't ever call you back, now does it? - Yeah, right. Tell me anything. Ah, my god! Hi, Daddy! - Oh, my baby girl. Oh, it's so good to have you home. All my kids under one roof. Oh, it's gonna be a great Christmas. (dishes clattering) Honey, is everything all right in here? - Oh, everything's just fine, hon. This pan was so darn hot, it burned my hands through the mittens. I just got a little mess to clean up here, that's all. (Mom gasping) Is that my son and my daughter? Come over here! Let mamma look at you! - [Gary] Ah! - Oh! - [Gary] Hey, Mom. - Gary, it's so good to see you. You don't come this way anymore, but it looks like Miami is treating you well. - That's what I just told him. - Mmm-hmm, fillin' out. Look at those biceps. Turn around and let me look at you. Look, what is this? - Mom, what are you doin'? - Stickin' out from this coat? Oh my goodness! That little booty has finally filled out those pants! - Mom! - You must've got that from your daddy, 'cause you sure didn't get it from me. - Well, I've definitely grown up, Mom. - Well, you look great. Shayla. Come over, baby girl. - [Shayla] Hey, Ma. - Hey. - [Shayla] Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you, too. Anybody hungry? - Aren't you going to say hello to my family? Your granddaughter has been dying to meet you. - Hi, Granny's baby. Mr. Willie. You all right over there? - Does he ever talk? Sorry. - And who is this fellow? - I'm Ken. How are you doin'? - Hmm. - Mom. Mom. Ken is my friend. He's going to be joining us for Christmas dinner. - Not exactly what I was expecting, but he'll do. Glad you could join us, sweetie. - Thanks for having me, ma'am. - Well, I am so excited. I have every second of it planned. - Don't we know. - And since I don't get to see you all very often, I thought I would take full advantage of having you here. And like I always say. - [Gary and Shayla] Every second counts. - Yes, Mother, you've been saying that since we were kids. - And life has proven it to be true, Gary. We're gonna have a great time this weekend. I've made so much delicious food. I've made your mac and cheese. I've baked pies, I'm making a cake. I roasted a turkey. And I even have my secret dishes ready for tomorrow's dinner. - Ooh, we're so excited about it. - Well, everybody out of the kitchen. I have to get done with my meal. Gary, don't you touch that cake. Out! Go to the living room. I've got work to do. (family talking indistinctly) - Family! Merry Christmas. I know y'all didn't think y'all was gonna get the party started without me. Lil sis, come and give your big brother a hug. - Lonnie, what's up, big brother? - It's goin' good. Just out here grindin', makin' it do what it do. - [Shayla] Mmm-hmm. - What's up, Mr. Willie? I see my sister got you stylish as usual. Not talkin' today? It's cool. I get that from you later. Lil brother. Come and give your big brother a hug. - Now why would I do that? - Because it's Christmas and you haven't seen me in a long time. Don't you miss me? (phone ringing) - Pardon me, I gotta take this. - Who are you? Let me guess. Lil sis, you out here pimpin' 'em in these streets? You got your baby daddy and your sugar daddy in the same house at the same damn time. Hoo-wee. I could learn a thing or two from you. - I am a married woman. And my husband is sitting right here. Don't insult him like that. (Lonnie sighing) - I'm actually here with your brother Gary. My name is Ken. That's twice. Okay. - Wait, so, where are my nieces and nephews? - Son. Is everything all right? - Unfortunately it's not, Pop. That was my boss. Looks like I won't be spending Christmas here with you all after all. - What? - I gotta catch the first flight back to Miami. - You just got here. I mean, there's no one that could cover for you? It's Christmas Eve, for god's sake. - [Gary] Unfortunately, no. - What kind of boss does that to their employees? It's Christmas Eve. That's just low and hateful. - That seems to be the running joke of my life these last few days. Can you please kiss Mom for me and tell her that I'm sorry? We gotta leave immediately. - Oh, son, I really hate to see you go, but I guess if you have to leave, there's nothing I can say to keep you here. Was nice to meet you, Ken. - [Shayla] I cannot believe you're leaving me here to weather this storm of your family all by myself. - I know, I know. - I love you, big brother. - I love you, too. I'll see you all soon? - [Lonnie] Peace out, lil bro. - Merry Christmas, everybody. - [Shayla] Merry Christmas. - So, what was that about? - What was what about? - Your exit. Because to me it seemed like everything was cool until your brother came into the picture. - So you didn't just see how the whole entire scene played out? My phone rung, I answered it. It was work and now I gotta catch the first flight out of here. - I don't know too many employers harassing their employees on Christmas Eve, but who am I? I'm just the hired help. - Right, just the hired help. Listen, if I said that it was work, that's exactly what I mean. And don't worry about it. You'll get paid for this whole entire weekend. Come on, let's go. - Oh, well, that's all I needed to hear. Let's go. All that food your mom was cooking and we had to dart out before we could get a morsel of anything. (Gary chuckling) - What is that? - It's a cookie. You want some? - Yeah, give me a piece. Can't wait to get back to the hotel so we can order room service. (cookie crunching) Mmm. This is good. Did you make this? - I did. I know how to move around the kitchen. That's why I wanted to taste your mom's food, because I know a good cook when I see one. - Well, she does all right. - I can tell. Ooh, the ferris wheel! Driver, pull over right here! - We don't really have time for that. We have to get back to the hotel so I can pack, remember? - Pack what? You just got here. You can't possibly have that much to pack. Besides, it's only 15 minutes. 15 minutes and we can head out. Come on, it'll be fun. - 15 minutes. - 15 minutes. Thank you.

Because I thought your name was Darren or Darryl or something. Yeah, Darryl, right? When did you start going by Ken? - It's always been Ken. - Really? - Oh, shit. Maybe I'm talking too much. Anyways, what are you doin' out here? - Well, we were on our way back to the hotel. Then we stopped so I could see the ferris wheel. - Wait, we? My brother's out here? - Oh, yeah, you don't see him right there? - [Shayla] Why is he? (Ken laughing) - I gave him some of my cookie before we got out here. - Cookie? - A weed cookie. - Shut the hell up. (Ken laughing) Is that why he's high kicking like he's in a vogue competition? (Ken laughing) - [Ken] You want me to call him over here? - No, no, no, no, no. He looks like he's having fun. Let him be. - Don't you think I should tell him? - [Shayla] No, don't tell him. (laughing) - Okay, but what are you doing out here? You didn't want to stay at your mother's soiree? - Oh, we just needed some fresh air, that's all. It's a nice night to be out. The wind is blowing, the people are extra nice, I guess 'cause of the holidays. It's a nice night. Oh, and 'cause of global warming it's not too cold or chilly. It's perfect. - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh, and of course I wanted to bring my family out here to see the lights. She hasn't stopped smiling since we got here. - 'Tis the season to be jolly. - It is! (both laughing) But anyways, you should probably get him inside before he hurts himself. - [Ken] I think that's a good idea. - Yeah. Oh, and hey. Do me a favor? - What's that? - Take care of him. - I can do that. - Oh, and of course, give this to my brother for me. - Oh! - Every second counts with that. - Oh! - Oh my gosh, I am starting to sound like my mother!

Carol summoned me back to the office first thing bright and early tomorrow morning. I'm just followin' the captain's orders. - [Alano] My nigga, I guess you didn't hear me say I got you covered. You don't have any reason to have yo ass back in this damn office. Only pathetic people like me who don't have anything else to do on the holidays. - I wish it was that easy. Maybe you didn't hear me say summoned. - And maybe you didn't hear me say I got you covered. I cover all the VPs during this time of the year. Shit, I'm starting to think it's somethin' she's got against me, tryin' to get back at me. Wait a minute. Well, I'll be damned. Look, you got your Ken upstairs, your family only a few blocks up the road. Everybody doesn't have that. (Gary chuckling) - You're right. I don't get a chance to see them often. - Exactly. Whatever it is, let it go. Go drink, be merry. Hell, go fuck that nigga! You done pay all this money, the least you could do is get your dicks up. At least I would. (Gary laughing) - Bye, Alano. I love you. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, friend. Bye. ♪ Amen ♪ - Driver, can you please return me back to the hotel? - [Driver] Sure can. (Gary chuckling) (door clicking) (luggage rolling) - [Gary] After giving it some thought, and after the traumatic experiences I've had these last few days, I could really use a few miles of deckin' the halls. Plus, I didn't want you sad and alone in this hotel room by yourself. (Ken laughing) - All right, let's get this party crackin'. - Crackin'? Is that how you're feeling, Daddy? - I'm still hip a little bit. Don't sleep on your dad. Where do you think you got it from? - [Shayla] Mmm. - Wait a minute. How you takin' all the credit? As if I wasn't the one in the hospital pushin' these babies out for 40 hours in labor. - You win, baby, you win. - All right, don't try to give me credit now. We have to deal with that later. - So. How's this supposed to go? - Well, when I first planned this, I thought your family was gonna be here and we could create teams of two. Gary's usually here by himself, and I thought he could be with Shayla and create a team. - Ma! How you gonna play me like that? - It's true! - Come on! - Um, and Shayla has a family of her own, thank you very much. And we make a great team. Don't we, baby? We gonna crush y'all. - Well, I hate to break it to you. This year Gary has me, and I don't lose. - Thank you, because Ma over here tryin' to play me. - Our kids. (laughing) Okay, well, look. My baby and I have been decorating these stockings for years, so I think we have the upper hand this time. - Lonnie, you can sit this one out if you want to. I'm sorry, but I planned this before I knew about the divorce between you and Melissa. - It's not your fault, Mama. It's not your fault that two days before Christmas she decided to take the kids and serve me with divorce papers. - Well, you can have Ariel help you if you like. - No thanks. I can do a stocking stuffin' thing all by myself. - All right, suit yourself. - Well, honey, you ready to start the timer? - I'm ready when you are. - All right, and let the best couple win. - [Ken] That's easy. - We got this. - [Rachel] So hard, oh my gosh. - [Shayla] I'm gonna give it red. - [Ken] You get over it. - [Gary] You're almost out of line! - [Ken] That's ugly. - [Gary] Come on, no! - Thanks. I think red and yellow's a good one, right? Okay, here. Hold this one. - Like I was saying. Your mother and I have been at this for awhile. - [Shayla] You guys have stick ons? - Oh, with all due respect, Mr. and Mrs. Elliott, at the beginning I did say that I don't lose. It's an ugly stocking contest. - Boom! Now that's how you win a stocking contest! Ah! - Really is ugly. That is really ugly. (Gary clearing throat) - Well, if Willie and Ariel didn't keep stealing my markers, we would've won. (timer dinging) - Um, let me go check on my turkey. - Baby, are you okay? You don't look so good. Come on, let's let you down for a nap before dinner. - He looks the same to me. Is everything all right? - Yeah, everything's fine, Daddy. We just had a long day. We skipped nap time to wrap presents, so he's just a little tired, that's all. - A little tired? How can you tell? He hasn't said a word or moved this entire time. I don't think I ever heard him say a word. - [Gary] Come on. - How do we even know he's alive? - I know my husband. - Has anybody here heard him say a word before? Pops, have you? - What is it with you? You're always walking and talking as loud as you possibly can, but where are your wife and kids? Oh, that's right. She left you. Now excuse me while I go and lay my husband down for a nap. Come on, baby. - Mr. Willie, get yourself a nap. We'll see you at dinner. - Damn, Mr. Willie. I ain't mean to beat you like that. - Son. - Come on, Pops. Somebody has to say somethin'. - Well, who said it had to be you? Excuse me, I gotta go return this phone call. - I'm gonna go get some fresh air. - Hmm. And I'm gonna go check on my wife. ♪ Raindrops on roses ♪ ♪ And whiskers on kittens ♪ - I guess I'll just sit here. Some kind of Christmas. - It was about to get heavy in there. - Yeah, it was. Family stuff. Years and years of conversations we should've had, but never did. You know how that goes. - Okay, but why does it still seem like there's so much tension between you and him? - Mmm. My mother. - Mmm. - In her eyes she thinks he's the perfect one. He graduated high school, went off to college, married his high school sweetheart, had kids, created a family. Then you have me. I went to college, couldn't get past my freshman year. I just didn't want to be there anymore. You know, you have this whole entire world. They tell you to go out and get a college degree, but I don't want to do that. That wasn't acceptable to me. So I dropped out. By the time they found out, I had packed up and moved to Miami. Lived there for almost a year. - A whole year? Damn. - Yeah. They never pay that much attention to Shayla and I. Lonnie was their golden child. If anybody was gonna get it right, it would be him. They wanted us to be perfect just like he was. That wasn't the case. We're all different, all three of us. Lonnie is smart and outspoken. Shayla, well, she lives in her own world, as you can see. She was a female growing up with two older brothers who lived two different lives. Somewhere along the line of her playing with Barbie and having these tea parties on the lawn outside, it just followed her into adult life. - Hence the baby on the back. - Yeah. - Got it. - If it works for her, then it works for me. You know, we all have our own versions of life that we have to live. - Okay, but why don't you ever come home? For Christmas at least, Gary. - For what? So I can sit around and listen to them brag and boast about Lonnie and how perfect his life is and his wonderful wife and his beautiful kids? I'm good on that. Did you notice how no one wanted to speak about his divorce until they had to? - Mmm-hmm. - My mother has this preconceived idea of what she thinks family is supposed to look like and how it's supposed to be. Shayla's family looks nothin' how we grew up, yet she's happy. And that's what it's supposed to be about. Happiness, right? - [Ken] Mmm-hmm. - You know, family doesn't have to be about male and female. So I just choose not to deal with that negativity in my life. - Now, in all fairness, you were not honest and upfront about your situation, either. (Gary laughing) - Okay, now who's side are you on? - I'm just sayin'. I'm sure Lonnie knows that he's the family favorite, but even still, you gotta give him props because he still admitted a defeat. - Which is a true statement. And I'm sure it's tough. Hell, it's tough for me. - Sometimes you gotta let people be there for you. Sometimes, hear me out, you gotta let family be there for you. - If I didn't have you here with me this weekend, I don't know what I would be doing right now. I really don't. Thank you. - You're welcome. - All right, enough about me. What's up with you? What's your story? You know, you're handsome, you're young, you're attractive, you have beautiful teeth. (Ken laughing) This amazing energy, this tight little booty I see when you walk. - Really, sir? - Yeah. Nah, I'm playin' now. Yet here you are on this app, you know, being paid for your services. How did someone like you end up in this line of work? - Well, for starters, I didn't end up anywhere. All of this is a choice, all right? Growin' up where I'm from, I didn't have a luxurious upbringing. But as I got older, I learned that people will pay for anything. And so I began to use that to my advantage. You get one life to live. - True. - And you have to do everything it is you wanna do in that one life. I'm just not a nine to five kind of guy. But when I found out how much money I could make and I get to travel on someone else's dime? Oh, I was sold! - Okay. So where does one get an application for this line of work? - Let's just say I was recruited. - Huh. Recruited. Yeah, but don't you ever think about the consequences or the dangers that comes with it? - Nah, listen. I could work a nine to five and be chained to my phone, waitin' around for someone else's command like you, or I can just do my own thing. I haven't been doing this a long time. You're only like my third assignment. When I showed up to your hotel room, I didn't know what to expect, because normally that means sex. But this has been very different. I've been so comfortable. I slept like a baby in that bed. That ain't never happened before. - And you let me hold you. - I did. That was my favorite part. - Mine, too. - We better go inside. - Yeah, we better before my mother has a fit. - Your mother is playin', because we've been here all damn day and we ain't eat shit. What time to y'all eat around here? - Hell if I know. This my first time here like it is yours. - Mmm-hmm. Look up. - Yeah, mistletoe. Too bad you got rules. - I do. But I'm in luck. Because the other night at the ferris wheel, your sister told me to give you this. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. So my sister Shayla told you to give me that? - She did. - You know what? Let me find out if Shayla knows my T. (Ken laughing) - We better go inside, sir. - Yeah. No, no, no, wait, wait. We ain't gotta go nowhere. - I'm hungry, sir. I haven't eaten all day. - Oh, so you're stomach empty. That's the perfect time. - Let me find out you're a dilf. - What's a dilf? - A dad I like to fuck. - Wait, wait! So you callin' me old? - Shayla called you old. I just called you daddy. - All right, you better watch out. Your stomach empty, too. You mess around and get this pa- - See? Now I'm startin' to believe you starvin' me on purpose. 24-hour notice, sir. Let's go. (Gary laughing) (hand smacking) Ooh! (Gary laughing) - Why does it matter? And what does it matter to you? See, the issue is that you're always meddling in everyone else's business when you need to worry about your own. - No, the issue is someone needs to get you evaluated! This shit isn't normal! She's pushin' a 90-year-old man around in a wheelchair with a baby doll on her back and callin' it a family! Nobody sees anything wrong with that? Am I the only one sees something wrong here? - Nobody asked you! Nobody ever asked you! For personal reason you always feel the need to insert yourself! How about you go find out where your damn wife is? Is that not enough business for you to mind? How about you go figure out why on Christmas Day the family you created doesn't even want to be around you. And you let me worry about me. - Okay, I think that's enough. - Then tell him to shut up! - I am tellin' you to not use those words in this house and don't use that tone in this house! Especially with me! - Oh, what tone is that? The one where I actually have an opinion or something to say about my life? He started with me. He attacked me and my family. - Okay, what did we just walk in on? - Your sister being reminded that she needs a psych evaluation. - Your brother minding my business and your mother defending his tactless behavior like always. Everyone has forgotten that I am not a child anymore. - Well, you are my child and I am telling you not to use those words in this house! - Telling me? 'Cause I guess it would be too much to ask me. Or maybe for once try to understand and see things from my point of view. You never see anything wrong with the shit he says! - I'm never wrong! Especially in this case, Shayla! Gary, you don't see anything wrong with this shit? - Listen, you leave me out of it. I don't got nothin' to say. - You never have anything to say. Take her side like always. Matter of fact, why don't you just stay away like you always do? Always seeking attention. I came here to celebrate Christmas, not to attend your comin' out party. - Lonnie! - No, Pop. No. Now you listen. And I want you to hear me, hear me loud and clear, that you was the last motherfucker that I wanted to see. As a matter of fact, it looks like I'm not the only one who doesn't want to be around you. Maybe, just maybe if you would stop talking so much and you would stop riding everyone, everyone would stop pushing away from you! - Stop it! All of you! It's Christmas! Can we just get through dinner? Could we just have this conversation later? - No, Daddy, we can't. 'Cause this is gonna be like every other conversation that we haven't had. There you go just trying to sweep shit under the damn rug again. - Enough! Now I have asked you to not use those words in this house! You will not, you will not use that kind of language, either! Not in this house! So you either show some respect or leave! - You know what? I can leave and I will leave. - No, sis. - Me and my family are out of here. Some damn Christmas is this. - Shayla! Shayla! - Let her go! - Why don't you go? - I'm sure no one would reject you leavin'. And take your little boy toy with you. - Lonnie, that's enough! - You know, it would be really good if you pulled your head out of his ass for once. Be a mother. Just be a mother. Shayla! (somber music) Pop! Pop! Come quick! Come quick! (machines beeping) - Daddy, you don't have to stay here. I know it's Christmas. - We're not goin' anywhere. - Gary, don't make him go through my drama. - We're fine. We're not going anywhere. - Relax, baby girl. We'll stay here all night if we have to. - Daddy, I didn't mean to be disrespectful earlier. - Oh, shh. You don't have to worry about any of that. - I know I look crazy to y'all, okay? I know. I'm 24 years old with a fake baby strapped to my chest. And I'm married to an 86-year-old man that I push around in a wheelchair. I know it looks crazy. But when I wake up in the morning, they're there. He's there, Daddy. And I don't have to worry about him leaving the house and not coming back because, I don't know, someone put a bullet in his back or something. He's not out there cheating on me with the next pretty girl or guy. We like what we like and that's okay. They're mine, Daddy. And as strange as it may sound, he understands me. He knows how to make me feel good. He's, he's there. And Ariel. Daddy, Ariel is just the prettiest little girl I've ever seen. (crying) She was mine for three weeks, for three weeks. I knew what it was like to love something more than you have ever loved anything in your entire life. She was mine. And one morning I just woke up and she wasn't breathing. (sobbing) - [Papa Gary] Baby girl. - And I thought that it was my fault. (sobbing) - There's no reason you should have to go through this all by yourself. (Shayla sobbing) - My family might not look like yours, but they're mine, and every second with them counts. For me, Daddy. (Shayla sobbing) - Nurse. Please tell us you have good news. - Looks like Santa's still delivering gifts. He's stable. We're still running some tests, but he should pull through. That man is a fighter. - Thank you. - Merry Christmas, everyone. - Thank you. - It'll be okay. (crying) It'll be okay. (Shayla sobbing) - Hey, yo, G. I think you need to come unwrap your Mr. Claus. (Gary sighing) - I just watched my sister emotionally hangin' on by a thread. It's Christmas Day and her husband was just rushed to the emergency room. My family is falling apart and all that you can do is offer me sex. Wow. Talk about perspective. - I'm sorry. Say what? - You weren't there? You didn't just experience that with me? - I was there. Aren't you the same person that just was trying to screw me at your parent's house? - [Gary] Don't try me with that. - Try you with what? - You heard me. - So I'm makin' it all up? Aren't you the one that's been thankin' me all day for lettin' me hold you last night, starvin' me so you can screw me at your parent's house? Am I making that part up? Remember when I told you to remind me to tell you something that I observed about you? You don't know how to communicate. And when you don't know how to say how you feel, you lie. - If you wanted to cheer me up, you should've sat me down and had me sort out through my emotions. - Oh my gosh, what do you want from me, Gary? One second you want an emotional support animal, the next second you wanna screw me. What do you want? Y'all go on and on and on about how Shayla needs to be evaluated. Well guess what? Maybe yo ass needs to be evaluated, because you're so great at seein' everybody else's shit but you're unable to see your own. That's why he dumped you. - Well. You know, Christmas is over. You got all your money. This assignment is done. I think it's time for you to leave. - You wanna know what I think? I think that's the best thing you've said all weekend. (shirt flopping) (door clicking) (Ken exhaling) - Willie's gonna make it. - Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Oh, I hate what happened earlier. I'm so sorry. - There's nothing we can do about it right now. But we all have to fix this. - You're right. We will, honey.

I'm tellin' Mama! - Shh! - [Lonnie] Mama! - What is goin' on in here? - Mrs. Elliott, I can explain. For the last couple of days, you've been cookin' all this good food and we didn't get a chance to get any. Yesterday Gary thought he had to fly back to Miami, so we didn't get a chance to eat. And today y'all had all of that family stuff goin' on and we didn't get a chance to eat. So I talked Gary into sneakin' back in so we could get a plate of food. It was wrong and I'm sorry. - How dare you! Gary, you know better! - Ma, I know, I'm sorry. But we, we were just so hungry! - Well, if you're going to taste the flavors and the moistness of my turkey, it has to be warmed up first. - Um, I don't want to be the one to say this, but you've been cookin' that turkey for the past six days, and all we got to do is smell it. - Excuse me. That turkey takes perfection. And we never made it to dinner. You and your sister were mouthing off at each other, Mr. Willie was rolled out of here. It was just all too much happening at one time. Lord, have mercy. It's been some kind of Christmas. But let's all sit down at the table and I'll make you some plates. How about that? - All right. You need help cuttin' the turkey? - I do. - 'Cause I'm pretty swift with a butcher knife. - Get you a knife. - I'll get the silverware. Hey, Gary, grab us some glasses. - [Rachel] Yes. - Get the napkins, too. - Got it, Pops. - [Rachel] That's right. Everybody get busy. - Got room for one more? - We absolutely do, baby. - Mom. - Shh, shh, shh. Don't say a word. I owe you an apology. I never should've handled you like that, and I'm sorry. And you, too, Gary. I'm sorry. I'm always saying make every second count and I almost ruined our entire time together. I'm happy to have you home, both of you. I love you so much. Come in here, give mommy a hug. Let's eat, okay? Let's eat. - Finally we get to eat after how many days? Oh! (family laughing) Drivin' me nuts! Let's go cut this turkey, sis. (Gary laughing) - [Rachel] Let's all go. (upbeat lively music) - So I guess this is goodbye. - Yeah. I guess it is. - For real this time. - For real this time. I just wanna say thank you for spending Christmas with me. You made it so special and memorable. Made me forget about Darryl and Carol and everything else I have goin' on back in Miami. - I told you, I create memorable moments. (Gary chuckling) But you created some for me, too. Because of you I didn't have to spend Christmas alone. So thank you. And who knows, maybe you'll need a boyfriend for Valentine's Day. - Oh, god, no. I'm gonna stay single. Trust me. - Take care of yourself. - See ya later. - So you really are gay? - Yup. Guess it's obvious, huh? - So how long have you two been, um. - Been what? Like, together? - Yes. - Oh no, we not together. - What do you mean? - I don't know that dude. I met him a couple days before you did. - Wait.
