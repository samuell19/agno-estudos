Smoking and drinking is injurious to health. Smoking and drinking is injurious to health. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Where are they hiding? Fatty! Out! - No! I sat in a corner and was eating. How did you find me, Sita? - I didn't see you, I heard you. Heard me? How? I could hear from there that you are eating Janthikalu (Andhra snacks). No! Sravya! Out! Leave me and go and find your brother-in-law. He's too smart! He's not smart! I'm smart! For whom? - Shh! For brother-in-law. Thanks, grandmother. Grandmother helped her son-in-law to win... ...the game of hide and seek... ...and made him happy. Though it is a small scene... ...it has etched a deep memory in grandson's heart. Also after 20 years... ...how would it be if the grandson makes them realise the family values... ...and help his grandmother win and make her happy? The only house... ...which we can call our house happily... ...it is this house. 'Grandmother's house'. Brother-in-law, you know what happened recently? My wife came to me and asked... ...what do you call a person in English, who's lucky. What did you say? I said they call him as 'unmarried'. Next? I went to the dentist. Daddy! - Hey! Stop your jokes, brother. Have coffee, brother-in-law. God has given the good fortune to laugh only to humans. Let us use it. How are you, brother-in-law? - I'm fine. She inquired about brother-in-law now, and next... ...she will ask where we can buy gold at cheap rates. Brother, you reminded me well. Brother-in-law, you said you have a friend in Dubai, right? I think you should tell him and get a golden biscuit. I'll definitely tell. - Okay. Hello, brother-in-law. When have you come? - Hi Ravi. Hey, nice T-shirt. - Elder brother bought it. Brother-in-law, it was loose like a kurta when I bought in the shop. It became tight like a vest after bringing it home. That's why I gave it to him. Brother-in-law, I've an urgent work, I'll meet you later. Going for movie with Vasu? Take care of my brother. - Go and enjoy. Why do you do it slowly? Make it fast. - Okay, sir. Sometimes it is raw and sometimes fully grown. Don't know what one should do to make a person tell truth. Stop it! Sons-in-law come home for festivals. But my father says it is a festival whenever son-in-law comes home. Is doctor great? I'm tractor. He gives stitches, I do ploughing. I will also become a big businessman... ...if I go to the city with money. Wow! Dear... What is this? - Coffee. Do you have any sense? Did you hide it in order to save it? How can I drink coffee after eating sweets? Like washing face after applying powder. Useless woman! - Father, mother is not giving me Boost. Is it, dear? Buffalo is mine, milk is mine and fields are mine. What do you lose? Will you not give Boost to my daughter? - I'll give right away. So until we express our anger, people don't speak their minds. Strange world! You're like your father! Father! It'll be good if it stay together like this. What does it mean? - Unity! Strength! My God! Your grandson has taken after you. Crap! - But for making others laugh... You don't feel shy. - Eat brother-in-law. You should stand first in everything. - Dear... Elder son wants to talk to you about something. - What is it? Not something new, it's the same like before. It is about distributing property. Don't expect a new reply every time you ask. Ask something different if you want. What is there to talk other than property? From the time I asked you to distribute the property... ...four of my friends went to city, built their houses and have settled well. But I... ...didn't achieve anything till now. - Elder son. House is not built with walls. House is built with people staying together. Fields are not for division, they need to be cultivated. Suryarao, tell about your son. Tell outsiders to enter the house... ...but tell them not to interfere in family matters. What are you talking? - Leave it, sir. Brother-in-law, don't mind for interfering. According to me, father-in-law is right. What right? Though I've a daughter of marriageable age, entire village still calls me his son. Moreover I have to serve the guests and look after their needs. My life has become a supervisor. Everyone will go in different ways if I distribute the property. Yes, people like you... ...know only to have children but... ...don't know to distribute property and make them owners. Today it should be decided... ...whether you want to continue to dominate or distribute property? Elder son wants to go to the city and make progress. Distribute the property. Okay, tell your opinions too. Come on tell, you like it, right? I agree with father's decision. You tell. Father, we want to start business in Vizag. We like if the property is distributed. Good! What about you? Speak up! I'm against distributing this property. No need to listen to the opinion of sons-in-law in this matter. No need! Elder son... Be it sons or sons-in-law, all are same to me. Son-in-law, you are right. I've earned this property but... ...I don't wish to keep this property out of selfishness. Will I take this with me after death? Silly boy! I'll distribute it equally to my three sons and two daughters. But you will get the share in property only if you remain a part of this family. This is my final word! So instead of leading our own lives... ...we should live here forcibly, right? You mean to say that you will give food only if we starve. Tell whether you want to give or not. Maybe you'll take this property with you when you die. Brother-in-law, it is wrong to talk like that for property. It is wrong for son-in-law to talk between father and son regarding their property. Brother-in-law, one should give respect... ...and keep respect. - Whom should I respect? Elder son! What respect? He shouldn't have acted in haste like that? You want him to be happy. He wants to make progress. That's the only difference! Decision is yours! Have milk. By talking of property distribution, elder son has caused his death. We're leaving. - Where, brother? You should settle everything... ...but how can you leave like this. He said property belongs to those who stay here. I've more self-esteem when compared to others. Everyone is saying I killed my father for property. We can't stop villagers from talking. That's why I'm giving up on property and leaving this village. Brother! How can you leave without conducting post funeral rites? What more rituals are there when everything is finished? I'm leaving. Brother! Please stop! Don't go! You've been waiting alone for sons from 10 years. For how many years you will wait like this, madam? Will people don't change when times are changing? I'll wait as long as I'm alive. For your husband and your peace... ...God should come to change them. Grandmother? Mother, grandmother is calling. Talk to her. How are you, mother? Don't know how long I'll live... Why do you talk like that, mother? Grandmother, don't feel sad. Uncles, aunts and everyone will come. That day will come, grandmother. - If your words come true... ...then I'll take vow to visit Annavaram. Grandmother, I'll come before that. No, your father will scold. Anyway, you always have this trouble. Okay. Mother... - Mother, your son-in-law will come now. I'll call you later. - Okay, dear. - Bye. I pity grandmother. She's suffering from 20 years. Because of your age-old enmity and anger. Your father has not forgotten the insult and slapping he got till today. I too wish to meet grandmother and see all. Doesn't uncles want to see grandmother? I think they don't even... ...think of grandmother. Where are they now? Come! Come! Peketi Baburao sir. A1 Contractor! I feel so excited hearing your words. You're giving me this title before I get it. Maybe you will get it. If you get me the Port contract... ...I'll become A1 Contractor. Everything lies in your hands. It is in your hands too. - Black or white? You came to my house. Anyway, why do we need crores of money... ...that takes lot of time to count and... ...also the currency that flies away in wind. See if you could sell off your fields. Land? My wife is an ardent devotee of Pithapuram Kukkuteswara Swamy. We're planning to settle there after my retirement. That's if you could get me 10 acres of farm land in that area... Land in Pithapuram is very expensive. The competition for this tender is also the same. You'll stay in the farmland that costs 10 crores, definitely. If you could get me the tender application form... You... I want to give this to you from the beginning... Thank you, sir. - All the best. Similar to asking 10 kilograms of sweets... ...the officer asked for farmland that costs 10 crores. Even the cost of sweets have increased a lot. Within 20 days find where we can get 20 acres of farmland in Pithapuram. He will find it, before that you look here. How are you, Mr. Bapineedu? A person like you treats his mistress better than a wife. I don't see you at all these days. You're not meeting at all. Your PA takes the calls. Watchman throws me out if I come to your house. Why didn't you tell me? - Sir... Why do you trouble an elderly person? Sorry, sir. - Keep quiet. You're too good at acting. First tell me about the 10 crores that I gave you. I need an answer today, right now. Bapineedu...mind your words... Words give strength to people, you're becoming weak for talking more. Should I tell you a story? - What? A person like you... ...offered milk and egg to a hungry snake. It had both and then bit him, he died. What's the lesson in this? - The snake is not loyal. No. That person doesn't have sense. - Why? Bapineedu, snakes are bound to bite, I'm like a snake. You ran behind me like a dog until I gave you 10 crores. Because of people like you... ...loyalty is limited to dogs. Why do you say dog when I said snake? Look, you made me to slap you instead of talking to you. Don't make the matter worse, Bapineedu. This matter will get worse. Oh! Will it reach the government? No need for that. Tell whoever you want to tell. Go away. I'll teach you a lesson. - Get lost! Sir, will he do something? Him? If he was intelligent then he wouldn't have given me money. If he's powerful then he won't threaten me. Don't think more about him. Anyway, everyone is talking about me. Am I actor Raogopal Rao? Baby! Baby! Coming, daddy. You should come in front of me when I go out. You should stand in front of me when I come from outside. Your father is going to become A1 Contractor. Really? - Yes. - Congrats, daddy. This is the tender form. Keep this near God with your hands. Okay, daddy. When will you become MD of Sita Constructions? Just one year and I'll finish my Civil engineering and then I'll become. One should have a daughter to become lucky in life. One should have son in order to learn a lesson. Ramesh, is the target completed? - Yes, sir. What about, Vittal? - Yes, sir. Ramana, you? - Not done, sir. What happened? - Unable to understand customers, sir. Shut up! Need to change the program based on customers' mood. Only then you can finish your target. Is it clear? - Yes, sir. - Good. Will sir never laugh? I joined 5 years back and had never seen him laugh. "Beautiful stars..." Hot samosas for our Keerthi. Eat. - I will not eat, mother. I want earrings. Buy them. I told you many times. Your father is busy with office, he'll get them. Don't you feel bored to tell the same thing from my childhood? My Keerthi is angry. My sweet child. Eat. See... Now... I think daddy has come. What happened? Look Ramana... - Sir... I told you hundred times and you... Stay on hold for a minute. - Yes, sir. Son, how are you classes going? - They're fine, daddy. Did you do your homework? - Yes... Yes, daddy. - Good. Ramana, listen carefully. Material should reach Kolkata by 11th morning. Mummy, do they give homework to daddy... ..like how they give to us in school? Mother, daddy never finds time... ...to spend with us, right? No... One kilogram sugar. One surf packet. What else? - What did you take? One kilogram sugar and small surf packet, total is 50. 500. You want anything else? - No. Remember again... before you left the house... ...your wife and son must have told you... ...bring milk pack and chocolate. I mean... - His money is lost for sure! You sit and think by drinking cold drink. Bring cold drink. Okay. - Maaza! - Maaza! Go. Take your Maaza. One Rexona soap. Just one soap for the entire family? Three soaps for three will keep you happy. Is it? - Listen... Three soaps. One small paste. - Why small paste? Take big paste, it will last for two months. It will last all our life if we don't use it. Mouth will also stink. What else you want? Tell. - Poor man! Give popcorn too. What else you want? - Nothing. 100...plus... Including your cold drink, it is 495 rupees. - My God! I'll give the change. No change... Five star... My God! I am finished. - Take the cover. Thanks. - Do visit sometimes. Did I spend 500 rupees instead of 50 rupees? Oh no! In the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit....AMEN! Oh God! What happened? It's crash! Our shares have gone down! First you relax. - How can I stay relax? There are many other things we have to share. What else? - What else? Kids! Let's first build properties... ...and plan well and then think of having kids. Please understand me. Mother! Mother! What happened, mother? I don't want. Give him. - You eat. Janaki... - Mother... How are you, mother? - I'm fine. How are you? - Mother... Hey... - Madam fainted and fell down recently. We stayed in hospital for two days, we came home today. Yes. - You go away! Mother! How are you now? - Signs of body... ...to say I'm growing old. Mother, why are you talking like that? All these years I thought I want everyone. But I didn't think what everyone wants. That's why I decided to distribute the property. Mother, why are you acting in haste? - With this reason... I wish to spend few days with you all. I want to see sons, daughters and... ...grandchildren to my heart's content. I called up everyone and... ...told them I'm distributing the property. On my behalf, at least you convince... ...son-in-law to forget the insult meted out to him... ...during property dispute and bring him. I'll tell him, mother. Take care of your health. Bye. What happened, mother? - Grandmother is unwell. She's talking with grief. Mother wants to see us all, she's telling us to come. You go. One minute, father. What? Father, it is not your mistake in what happened then. But for 20 years, grandmother and we are facing punishment. Father, we get summer holidays every year. Our friends would visit their grandmothers' villages. I couldn't go. I used to feel very sad. Father, I can go to visit grandmother without your knowledge. But I respect you and your words a lot. Father, we can't stay for long at cousins and friends' house. We want to come back. But we don't feel like returning from grandmother's village. Anger should be with words, not actions. Uncle committed mistake without knowing it. Love should be there in words as well as actions. You're committing a mistake without knowing it, father. Father, poor grandmother, she got her daughter married to you. She's begging to see her daughter once. Please, father. Yes... Your uncle acted in haste... ...and I couldn't think beyond it for so many years. I feel silly and bit guilty for it. Your uncle committed a mistake by hitting me. I'll not commit mistake by stopping you myself. To your grandmother's house, to her parents' house... ...myself to my in-laws house, we can go anytime there. Thanks, father. Officer asked for 20 acres farmland in Pithapuram... ...land settlement taking place in the same village... My God! Superb! You're superb, Baburao! Control! Control! Control, Baburao! Control! Dear... - Yes. Juice... - Give. Anyways, I'm the eldest son... ...I can't avoid. Let's go to village. What do you say? - Hmm. What did you decide about going to village? It is profitable going to the place which gives property... ...than going to place that gives livelihood. I'll get the investment I need if we go there. If we get the property then we can plan kids immediately. Sand smell! Awesome! Stop, driver! - Hey... What happened? Mother, you go, I'll go around the village. You remember grandmother's village, right? Mother, how can I forget? You go. - Come soon! Start, driver. It'll be nice if all fingers are held together. What does it mean? - Unity! Strength! My goodness! Your grandson has taken after you. Grandfather Suryarao... Who are you, son? Hand shouldn't be like this, all fingers should be held together. Your eldest grandson has taken after you. My goodness! Santosh! Is that you? Who is he? Looking very handsome! He is our Sitamahalaxmi's grandson. - Is it? How are your parents, son? All are fine, grandfather. Did you come to see your grandmother who is unwell? Yes, grandfather. I'll stay in the village till grandmother's recovers completely. Anyway, you could see your grandmother and... ...she could see you like this. Yes, grandfather. How are you? By your blessings of your grandparents... ...I'm looking after your fields and living happily. You're going to stay for few days so visit my house once. Yes, grandfather. - You'll come, right? Yes. - Bye, son. You have internet recharge? - Yes, 4G. Superfast! Recharge can be done through Paytm also. Oh! Urgent! I've small work. Will you sit in the shop? I'll be back soon. - I've to go. Be here, I'll return in five minutes. - Hey! What is this pressure? - Strange man! What to do? Cigarette? No, biscuit. Hello mister. Give newspaper. Hello! You! Newspaper! Hello! Give newspaper! Hello! That's today's newspaper. Why should I care for the date? You've put the table. Don't you know to clean it? I did your work, be happy. Why are chips like this? Are these chips? - Ask the company owner? Okay. Should I pay the money to them? You have cigarette? - Do you smoke? No! I just inhale. Do you have cigarette or not? It is... Are you the owner of this shop? Don't you know where the cigarettes are? Hello! I'm not the owner of this shop. Owner went out, he told me to stay for some time. Sorry. I misunderstood you. It's okay. - Immediately after seeing you... I knew you can't run a roadside stall too. You and your over action... Get up! Pay money! Over action? For just ten rupees! Take it. Who will pay for the paper? Your dad? - My dad? What should I say then? - Don't fight, sir. I'll pay for it. You wait. Go and take. Take. Fold it. I'll never meet a person like you again in life. Oh! She's an angel and I have to meet her again? You've proved to be Sitamahalaxmi's grandson. Bye. Come on! Come on! What's this dust? - You idiot! When did you wash the pants last? We washed them last year. Why do you want to know? Idiot! It is our mistake to talk to you! You think I've come prepared to argue with you! Get lost! Mallaiah, let's go. - Don't mess up with me. Come on! - Hey fatty! I don't know you. But how do you know they call me fatty. You're the only one fatty guy in Pithapuram. It's me. Santosh! Did you recognize me? I used to visit this village in summer holidays in childhood. We used to play together. - Santosh? You? - Yes. What is this work? - Am I Vijay Mallya... ...to possess flights and pants as many as him? I wear one and other is washed. We buy jeans at discount. Colour fades if it is washed frequently. It will be torn if you do like this. Will I keep quiet if it's torn? We will continue with it as a fashion. We will cut it till knee high and call it short. We will cut it more and use it as underwear. Finally we use it as loin cloth too. That's why take this stick... ...and learn this art. - I'm very happy. Why Santosh? For meeting childhood friend? No. Because he's still the same. Stop staring. Let's go to grandmother's house. Grandmother's house? Why should we go to my grandmother now? No. My grandmother's house. Come. - Oh, your grandmother's house. Guys, you carry on, I'll join later. Sita! You're out! Out! Now you should close the door. 1. 2. 3... Ramana! Hello! - Bangalore uncle? Ramana, can you hear me? - No, sir. Sir, hello... - Can you hear me? - Yes, sir. Tell me. Uncle... - Ramana... - Sir... Our company should target at least 10 members this month. - Sir. Convince at least 5 members and make minimum 3 members. Got it? - Yes, sir. Look, follow this every month compulsorily. I think uncle is busy with phone. Let's talk to him over the phone when we see him next. Grandmother, I like you a lot. Sitamahalaxmi residence. Come. What happened? - Paint. Mother, your loving grandson. Santosh. Grandmother. Did it took so many years... ...to visit grandmother? How are you, grandmother? You used to hide behind my drape in childhood. How big you have grown! - Grandmother. I got the house painted as you were coming. I'm being mad. These colours stand nowhere before the... ...happiness that you bring. I think they are still wet. It's okay, grandmother. I can wash it. Any jewellery will look nice on this sari. I bought after lot of thinking. - Hi aunt. How are you? - I'm fine. Who is he? - My son Santosh. My daughter Swarna. - Hi brother. Hi sister, hi uncle. - Hi. Enough of giggling. Let's go. Have milk. - Hi, aunt. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? - I'm fine. Hey... Your brother-in-law. Say hi. - Hi. - Hi. Grandmother, who is that foreign lady? She is... - We have people to sprinkle scent on guests at wedding... ...similarly grandmother must have arranged for her. Yes, grandmother? Shut up! She's is the wife of US uncle. They had love marriage. Come here, dear. - Yes. US uncle is very lucky. It was good that he works in US. Had it been West Indies or Uganda then uncle would have been in trouble. Stop it. Hi aunt. - Hi. Sandra. - Yes. Hey Santosh. - Hi uncle. You've grown big. What are you doing? - MBA. That's nice. Sandra, wanna have a word. - Okay. Excuse me. - Oh God! Save US uncle! Elder brother is also coming. Your elder uncle. He's become stout. - Yes. Same attitude! He's always on high! Be careful with the flowerpots, you might hit them and fall down. Mother! Mother! Grandmother? Mother! Hi daddy! What did you get for me? You like these apples, right? Take this. - Thank you, daddy. Is she my sister-in-law? Brother, how are you? We're alive. Santosh! - Mother? - Come here. Brother, this is my son Santosh. Roadside stall owner is my brother-in-law? What are you studying? - MBA. Everyone is studying MBA nowadays. Where is your doctor father? Has he come? Uncle, he said he has operations to perform. He said he'll come once they are done. - Tell him not to come. Because of your father's coming here, we're meeting here again after 20 years. He treats everyone's wounds over there... ...but he infected us with wounds here. Uncle, why should we discuss things from past? You're wonderful! Though wounds get healed immediately... ...it will leave a scar. We should like to hear others but shouldn't feel like answering back. I'm very happy that you all have come. Your father has left 100 acres of fields to me. 5 acres of coconut grove and this house. As your father said, I will divide 100 acres equally. Coming to coconut grove... As long as I live, it is my support. After me, this house and coconut grove belongs to you. Does anyone have any kind of objection in it? Okay, mother. I am okay too, mother. Okay for me. - So let's plan for registration tomorrow itself. What is it, brother? We met after long time. Why don't we find an auspicious date... ...and do registration after few days? Did you start? Just now I thought... ...that nobody is replacing your husband's absence. Good! Mother, why do we need auspicious dates for coming together and breaking up? Let's have registration tomorrow. Does anyone have objection? Brother, do it fast. I've lot of work in office. True! If we do registration tomorrow... ...then everyone can go to their houses day after tomorrow. Yes, brother. Since we're here for that so it is better to do it first. I'll get the documents ready. Hello Ramana. - Yes, sir. - Can you hear me? - Yes. Your target is to book five tickets to Bangalore in Tatkal service. Hello? God! I need to climb the ladder again. Sister, we already booked tickets for tomorrow evening flight. My planning is always perfect. We will get down at Vizag tomorrow. Why are you watching with a blank face? Let's go and book the tickets. Come. - Come. I became mother unnecessarily. It would have been good had I become property. Everyone would have shared. I thought everyone came to see grandmother. I didn't expect them to be so shrewd. Sitamma! She stopped immediately after my calling. She still respects me. Why do you mess up? - I didn't. You know how I helped her in childhood... Yes, don't you know? Ouch! What is that name? Are you my son? Or am I your mother? I thought it would be respectful if I call as Sitamma. What happened? Call me as Sita if you want to show respect. But don't add prefixes and suffixes. Else I'll thrash you. - Oh no! Sitamma! Sita... It seems you forgot the past. Since I saved you then so you're beating me. Else you wouldn't. - Stop it. You wait, I'm the hero in this scene. You don't talk in between. Wait! - Why should I wait? All comedians are becoming heroes. Shouldn't I become? You do whatever you want. - Oh my God! Sita! Tell me. When did you save me? In summer holidays... Ouch! Help! Sita! Get up! Though I don't know to swim, I saved Sita's life. I'm a very great person. I gave you a new life, you know. Ouch! Why did you slap me when I saved you from death? - You saved me. But you left my lotus. - Lotus? Saved me? Sorry, Sita. I didn't know it was you at the roadside stall... What were you doing if you knew? You would have acted smart, right? You're lucky, I'm leaving tomorrow. Otherwise roadside stall... Grandmother, are you thinking it would've been good if grandfather was here now? I would have wished the same had I been happy. What is it, grandmother? Your children have come. Their children also came. House is filled with happiness. What more you want? As long as you didn't come... ...I felt sad that you didn't come. Though you came for property... I thought you would stay in front of me... ...for few days happily. They are leaving tomorrow. Even before the paints on walls dried up... Grandmother, why don't you go and ask everyone to stay back? When I asked everyone to stay together earlier... ...they got separated for 20 years. Will they stay back if I ask them to stay when they are ready to leave? They won't stay. They won't stay. Uncle... Anyway, property division is over. If we can stay with grandmother for few days... ...she'll be very happy. We can do the registration later. Is it dear? Nuisance! This property is mine, registration is mine... ...signature is mine. Why are you dominating in between? You and your father are same. Son and father are one, they won't allow us to share the property. Will you not let us share it? Customers visit other shops when we close the shop for one day. If we close the shop for many days then they'll visit others shop in future. We won't stay, we'll leave. Won't you drink? I don't have the habit of drinking. - You don't have the habit? So make it a habit from now. Why are you crying? I saw grandmother crying. Don't know why but I started crying. Grandmother has been waiting for us since 20 years. For grandmother's sake, I've to make them stay here for at least 20 days. Even God can't stop them from leaving. Anyway, tomorrow is the registration. They made reservations before that. We have to stop them at any cost. - How? We've to do something. They said they're leaving tomorrow. Do something quickly. When will he come out? "Oh my dear..." Your time is good, shorty came out soon. What is this phone? Hello Subbarao? - Apparao sir, I couldn't arrange money. This world runs on money! Why should I look into your problems? If you don't give my commission today then your work will not be done. Commission batch? Your registration will not take place today even if you give one rupee less. Hang up! - Sir! Sir! Come on, come on. He's coming. Sir! Sir! Please give me lift. - Hey! Who are you? I'll fall down. - Sir, give me lift. Wow! I acted very well! Superb! I did as you said. I have a doubt. How will you benefit if he breaks his hand or leg? If his hand doesn't work for two days... ...registration will get postponed, right? My God! You're no ordinary man! Super! Super! - Hope everything is fine. Thank God! Everything is fine! His hands and legs are fine. Our plan seem to have flopped. Hope nobody has seen. I think my Nayana is fine. Hand is crushed! You've turned lucky in the last minute. Let's go. - That's good! Why did you stop here? - This is Sravya's house. Sravya...our Sravya? - Yes. Sravya! Sravya! I brought a guest to your house. Didn't you recognize him? - No. He used to teach us math in summer holidays. Santosh. - Santosh? Childhood memories are sweet, right? Though memories contain grief, they're good to remember. Do you still like Sita? I like her forever. Registrar! - Yes, Baburao sir. Are you coming? - Yes. Everyone? - Yes. Should I tell what the registrar is talking to uncle? How can you say? Though I'm weak in studies, I'm a scholar at lip sync. Okay, go ahead. Sir, I can't do the registration, postpone it for few days. He said this. Why? Because I left Sita under the auto after hearing "Laxmi dear" song. My hand got crushed like a pickle. 'Oh! What should we do now?' This is what he said. Sir, I can't come to office for few days, please don't mind. Registration is important today. Please sir. - By now uncle's anger crosses all limits. I came to office directly from hospital. - Are you in office? I'm leaving right away. - I need to go home, come fast. We're coming. - Have coffee. Forget coffee. Registrar is waiting. Tell everyone to start. Useless woman! God! Why are watching like that? Come. - I think we also need to go now. What are these twists? - How did he come to the office? Is he a southpaw? He should have broken the other hand too. - Come. On one hand, you turned lucky... ...and at the same time unlucky. You cannot do anything now. Registration will be done in sometime. Your folks will not listen to you now, they'll leave. I can't see you like that. I feel very sad. I'm going, bye. Bad time! Hurry up, Sandra! Airport is in Rajahmundry. If we don't start now then... ...we can't catch the flight after finishing registration. - Oh, is it? Why don't you eat and go? - No time, mother. We'll eat something on the way. Bye, mother. Bye, aunt. Did you pack paste, brush, towel and everything? - Yes, madam. I told you to pack pickles and snacks. Did you do? Yes, I'm carrying them. - Bring them carefully. Quick! - She's always in a hurry. Mother! Mother! Mother! - Coming, daddy. Yes, daddy. - Did you pack everything? Hope you didn't forget anything? - No daddy. Shanti... What aunt? - Elder son like sunnundalu (Andhra sweets) very much. Carry them. - No need. I left all my likes in this house when you said no to my likes. Though you are ready to give, there is no space in the car. You come. Where are the children? - They sat in the first car. Mother, how will you come alone after the registration? It's okay, I'll come with sister. Okay. Come. Bye, aunt. Is it ready? - Yes, sir. Everything? - Yes, sir. Sign here. Here? I'll do. Are you registering the farm? Yes. That's great! Forget about signatures. First decide my matter. Suryarao! What about you? I'm also asking the same. What will I get? I've been doing farming for you for 20 years. If one does farming for eight years then the land belongs to them. What? - I'm not saying this. Law! I think you know the law better than me. This is the difference between growing old and become wise. By the way, what do you want? - Fields. Is it? Fields belong to us, authority is ours and we are the heirs. Why should we give you now? Crap! - Hello! I looked after this property all these years. You're wonderful. I too should get my share. - So should we... ...give our properties? Get lost! - Stop sister. You want money? Tell me how much you want. - Keep it. Keep your money inside your pocket. This deal won't be settled with money. Man! This guy is too much! - Baburao sir. - Yes. I'm getting late, I need to go home. One minute, sir. We're coming. - Look! I don't agree with this registration. Settle your disputes outside. It's nothing, sir. We're coming. Brother, decide fast, we're already late. How many acres you want? This matter cannot be solved easily. We need to sit and talk. What shall we do now, brother? - What is this meeting? Damn nuisance! - Let's go home, I'll see there. Like losing a customer at the last minute... ...he came at the last minute. He and his smirk! He stopped registration in the middle. You wait! Brother, what about our trip? Not yours and mine. We're all heading towards settlement. Let us now leave now. We'll stay for a week to ten days and settle this matter. Oh my God! Week to ten days? We don't have so much time. Whoever needs it, they may stay. Whoever thinks it is not necessary may leave. How can we leave like that, brother? Let us decide something and leave. - I stay nearby. Kakinada! You need to think. You came all the way... ...so it is better to decide after settling the property dispute. I didn't expect Suryarao to do like this. Why will he not do? Farmer should stay in the fields. Servant should stay in the backyard. If you treat everyone with respect then... ...result will be like this. Happy birthday, Sita. Ugh! Roadside stall! You played many pranks in childhood. I hate you. No cheers. How are you able to drink in the midst of this dung smell? Mouth should be fine while drinking and not nose. I can tolerate any smell but not the smell of dung. Forget about it. Time is in your favour. I though you will bid farewell to them but see how they stopped. I've stopped them. What did you say? - I've stopped them. Did you stop them? How? After you left the registration office, I was thinking what to do. I got an idea then. Grandfather... Come inside, son. What brings you here, son? You need to do me a favour. - Tell me. Everyone stayed away from grandmother for 20 years... ...and now they are here when she decided to distribute the property. Before grandmother could feel happy for them... ...they are leaving today after doing the registration. Grandfather, we need to stop them at any cost. Nowadays old people are sent to live in old-age homes. By seeing your love for grandmother... ...I feel very happy, sir. Tell me what I should do, I'll do. You've been doing farming for 20 years, right? You stop the registration by raising this point. I'll take care of the rest. - Okay, sir. You're super. You're a fool to search happiness in others' joy. You didn't change. Happiness stays wherever Santosh stays. That's it! I'm saying this. Chapatti like break, tomatoes and chicken pieces on top. Paratha? Paratha? Go away. I think I'll die. - What happened, uncle? Santosh, your aunt eats pizzas and burgers. She can't eat our food. I don't know what to do. Don't worry, we'll get them from Kakinada. Is it possible? - Yes. Wow! Please look into it. Okay. - Thanks, Santu. Pizza house? - Yes, sir. Tell your order. I want a large pizza urgently. - Tell the address, sir. Here! Give it fast. What's the bill? - 340. Paytm. Paytm? - Yes, sir. Done! Thank you, boss. - Thank you, sir. Sister, this is wonderful. Hey! Keerthi! Stop! Stop I say. Why are you fighting? Grandmother! - Hey! Hey! She's a girl. Her ears will pain due to earlobes. Will her ears pain? Grandmother, her ears are not pierced yet. What is it? Didn't you pierce her ears yet? Aunt, your son is very busy. That's why I didn't pierce them. Okay, I'll do it. - Super, grandmother. This is the first function in the house to my beloved sister-in-law. Let's celebrate! - Yes. Why grandmother? It is enough if we take her to a beauty parlour and do it with gunshot. Small celebrations like these gives happiness to girls. But now traditions are changing... ...because of ignoring these things. Grandmother, not only traditions change with people like her... ...but they will become extinct. Like how we did it to you in childhood... ...we will invite all the neighbours... ...and get her ears pierced by Brahmam. Grandmother, I've a doubt. Were Sita's ear pierced with needle or syringe? What are you saying? You roadside stall owner! Go to hell! - Okay. Okay, grandmother. Let's celebrate the function. We will buy the clothes in Kalamandir store. Okay? - Yes, yes. - Okay for you? Tell me. - Thank you, brother-in-law. Hi fatty! - Sravya! Sit. Don't fear. Ouch! - My sweet child! Look here! It's over! Sita, our childhood friend Sravya. - Hi. Do you remember? Santosh? How are you? - I'm fine. How are you? Hello! Come and bless the child. - You go, I'll come. Go. Uncle, it would have been good if you too attended the function. I'm trying to get out of Suryarao's troubles by ignoring my business. But you're asking me as why I didn't attend the function. Hello! Hello! Sir! - Ramana. Tell me, sir. - Registration seems to get late here. What about our target there? Uncle... - How can it happen, sir? Need another week, sir. - Why is it so? Boss will give us lecture. - One minute, uncle. Keep the phone with you, I'll call you again. Okay, sir. Slowly. What is it? Baby's function was held without you. Function would have been more success if you were there. There's a smile on your t-shirt and not on your face, uncle. Pure gold. This is pure 22 carat gold. Take it, madam. I'll sleep happily now. I felt it is fake gold so... ...I came to you in a hurry. I know you'll not take money. Greetings. I'll pick it, grandmother. Mrs. Sitamahalaxmi, your younger daughter came... ...to find out whether the gold you gave is real or not. Hello. Mrs. Sitamahalaxmi. Mrs. Sitamahalaxmi? - I'm Santosh. I'll tell grandmother. Okay, son. - Who is it? It was Mr. Brahmam. - What did he say? He called up to say the function was very nice. Oh, is it? Ouch! Ouch! I would have broken my teeth had I fell in front. Gold bangles! It would have been nice if my mother gave two more. God! I lost my necklace! God! What happened? I lost my necklace in your house. Our workers are out in the fields. We'll search it in the evening. You want me to die here in this stinking dung smell till your servants return home? Aunt, necklace will be found. If anybody finds it, they will sell it. You'll understand my pain if you lose your gold. How did it fell here? Last night I... I was not getting sleep. I was walking around for getting fresh air. It fell in that dung. God! I lost my necklace! God! I became cheap as I came to take property. Nobody is worried about my necklace. Isn't there anybody who can find my necklace? God! I'm thinking as how to trap you. You're caught! Aunt, did you search here? It fell in the dung. Why do you ask if I searched here? Foolish girl! Aunt, I'm also asking the same. Search in the dung. Santosh... Search in the dung please... Aunt...it is...smell... He's from the city. Why do you tell him to do this work? I lost my necklace in your house. You and your ill-fated house! If this property was distributed long back then I wouldn't have entered your house. Stop crying, aunt. I'll search. I'll get full entertainment now. Please! Did you find it? - No, aunt. Revenge range should be increased! Aunt, how can he find it with leg? Tell him to search with hands. Santosh! Anyway, you have put your legs inside. Search with hands. I can tolerate any smell but not the smell of dung. Don't come out until you find my necklace. Keep searching. Entertainment with bonus. They made him to step into dung. Aunt, it will be found. - Look fatty... Yes, grandmother. She's a evil aunt. Aunt, I didn't find it. Didn't find? - Yes. My time is bad. I think I had seen her face after waking up in the morning. - Son. You go and take bath. Satti, get water for his bathing. You seem to be feeling happy for trapping me. I know you're not listening to the songs. What are you talking? Why will I feel happy? You did it for revenge, I did it for relationship. I don't understand something. Do you love me? Will I love you? Ugh! You're chasing me everywhere. No way! You roadside stall owner! Will you do anything for grandmother? I'll do. We walk on fire embers at festivals. We observe fasting and stay awake. Do we feel sad? No. I'll do anything grandmother says. I can't say how happy it makes me. I'll be waste if she feels sad as long as I'm here. You're not waste, you're best. My share is 20 acres. I want to sell it and leave. Tell me if there is any good customer. You too take good commission. - Okay, Ravi sir. But I heard the field is in dispute... No, no, nothing like that. It'll be settled in few days. My brother is dealing with it. - Oh! So, I'll inform you after finding a good customer. Bye. Okay. Why didn't this fatty guy come yet? It would have been nice if I had the necklace. Santosh. You too come. - Where, aunt? Elder uncle has arranged a secret meeting. He's arranged a secret meeting with village elders... ...in Suryarao's absence. If the meeting becomes successful... ...tomorrow morning we can do the registration and go home by evening. Secret meeting is arranged? My God! What to do now? - Santosh! Why do you take tension? Uncle will manage everything. Aunt, it is not that... What is it? Listen to me. Didn't I tell you that uncle will manage everything? Suryarao says we will hold a meeting. If it gets settled in your presence then it will be good. That's why we all have come. If you could... - Yes. I too don't like to make... Mrs. Sitamahalaxmi's family members stand as accused in village. Yes. - Shop is closed for many days. My sister. - Greetings. - Greetings. Sit. Let's finish it now itself. - Okay. Hey. - Yes. Tell Suryarao that I called him. - Okay, sir. Go. If grandfather Suryarao comes now... Suryarao is doing the farming for 20 years. If you take back your fields... ...then he's worried about his livelihood. That's why if you give him some money... ...he'll stay quiet. I already asked about it at registration office. He said no. That guys is really crazy. Look, for every work... ...it is necessary to have a congenial atmosphere. Yes. He's coming. He'll not say no to me. It is good if you give him his share. - Okay. Give him his share? I got them! Let's see. Aunt... - Yes. Did you get it? I'm sure that Suryarao will definitely listen to them. You're wearing gold but your brain is filled with silver. Why did you say like that? Aunt, these people belong to the same village. Did you get it? Since they are bargaining... ...so they must be in Suryarao's favour. Think about it. As far as I know, they will tell us some stories... ...and give Suryarao one extra share. Is it? - Yes. What are you saying? What now? What do you mean by settlement? As much as you want. If it was a certain amount then we would have decided it outside only. Why should we come to you? She's on fire! - Why should we give him? Is he doing the farming for free? He paid us only the lease amount. She messed up everything. You're talking as if we owe him something. Baburao, I'm talking in your favour. Why is she talking like that? You wait. - Wait. - Let me talk. You wait, brother. Will you discuss with us but take share from him? We're safe. Who doesn't know your plans? Who? Shh! Wait! - Are we making plans? No... - What is she talking? I'm talking about facts. - Hey... No... - Enough, Baburao. Enough. She is talking too much as we're listening. I thought of helping you. President... Hey. - Sir. - Don't call Surya. Come back. Sir, I'm at Surya's house. - It is... I'm telling you to come back. Sir... - Look Baburao sir. This matter should be decided in village meeting. Go. - President...no, no... Sir, sir... - Listen to me once. Leave! Leave! It is enough if every house has a woman like her. I'm saved! - President! President! Oh! We can't go now. - What to do now, brother? For one week, I cancelled all my works... I went everywhere... ...and finally scheduled a meeting the President. It was my mistake to call you. You messed up everything. Why were you shouting like that? It's become a habit for shouting at your husband. Learn to behave well... ...with outsiders and family members. Ugh! Let's go. Why does he say I'm shouting when I was talking? Thanks, aunt. Aunt, your pizza. Thank you, Santosh. - That's okay. I don't understand what America is. You went there and got married as if he doesn't have anybody. I got everyone married here. But I couldn't see their marriage. They must be looking great in wedding attire. I don't know whether Suryarao did a good thing by stopping the registration but... ...he gave me happiness by making you spend time with me. Grandmother said she is very happy. Thanks a lot. All this happened because of your support. Stop it, sir. This is nothing when compared to the help your grandparents did for us. This is nothing compared to it. I know how your grandmother is leading a lonely life for 20 years. Villagers would come to console her but nobody could make her happy. Finally you came after so many years. You gave her lot of happiness. I've been waiting for many days. Now I got you. This give us strength, son. Roadside stall! Your game is over! Stop! Stop there! We'll have to leave this house if you take one more step. You have fooled everyone. We cancelled our works and ran around registration office... ...and you are talking to the person who did all this. Why do you lower your head... ...by making us feel ashamed? Lift your head. Uncle, it is not that... - That's true. You can't expect children to be different... ...from their father. You and your father are same. You're his son. Do you know what my upbringing is. I didn't even touch my father's ashes after he said I won't get any property. Go to some faraway place from here. Go away! What is this now? Though situations close every possible door... ...God will keep one door open. But I don't think it will happen in my case. Let anything happen. I'll tell the truth. Uncle, one minute. Yes, uncle. I met Suryarao. It's a mistake. I talked to him. It's a mistake. - No. Don't talk further. Leave. His story ends with this scene. Leave, leave. - Brother. Everything we see is not true. Everything we don't hear is not lie. We've seen it from our point of view. Think from his angle. Maybe went to do compromise. He too had come for property. Thank God! God has opened a door. Uncle, as Bangalore uncle says I met Suryarao to make compromise. You thought different things. Sita saw me talking to him but she didn't listen. I said uncles have lot of work, they need to leave immediately. Didn't you tell that aunt also has work? She's a big trouble. - I told him, aunt. I went to tell him not to create fights. All this happened before that. - Then why were you feeling tension. I'm afraid of elder uncle. He never talks to me by looking at my face. Today he talked to me for the first time by looking into my eyes. I was afraid he will misunderstand me. Okay, what else you talked with Suryarao? I told him not to mess up with us as he has been a loyal servant to us for long. What was Suryarao's reply? He said fields are like mother to you... ...you can leave and go but it is like my daughter. He said he can't live without it. - He's a foolish fellow. He doesn't listen to an experienced person like me. Why will he listen to you? I went to do compromise but... ...not to make it complicated. Let's go, brother. Thank God! They believed it. - Aunt, it is... Don't know what you saw and heard. She too acts in haste like me. I can only see your father every time I see you. I listened to you. But if I hear that you were lying... Be careful! The scene I saw at roadside stall... ...and the story he is narrating is not in sync. How did he escape like that? If what I saw is right then did I hear it wrong? What is right and wrong? Him or me? At least you tell me. He is always right! What are you saying? What happened, Sravya? - Santosh... Sita and fatty are drowning. Sravya, why are you watching? Press Sita's stomach. Santosh, where are you going? If Sita finds out that I saved her then she will jump again. Whose name should I tell? I got it. He still remembers the friendship, stories and... ...everything from his childhood. Tell me the truth. Does he love me a lot? Yes, he told me. I tried to tell you this at the recent function. But you were not in a mood to listen. Finally I tell you something, Sita. Where Santosh stays, happiness is there. Dear Sita, I like you very much. I wanted to tell you this to you directly. But you always hate me. Forgive me if my mistake is there. I want to tell you something through this letter. However you hate me, I will always love you. With love, your brother-in-law Santosh. I'm sorry, brother-in-law. Did you learn about this word just now? I've misunderstood you all these days. I want to tell you something. Setting your hair back... ...shivering of lips... ...hiding your shyness... ...tell these things directly without any slow motion. I love you, brother-in-law. I've been waiting for this... ...from the time I came here. But one condition. What? - Don't call me as 'Roadside stall' from tomorrow. Okay. I love you so much, brother-in-law. New plan? To fool me? Nothing like that, brother-in-law. I know your plans, sketches and maps. Look, try to fool me... ...but don't become one. Hold it. Go away! - Brother-in-law! No! I shouldn't say 'I love you' to brother-in-law directly. He will think it as screenplay. I should make brother-in-law say 'I love you' to me. I should try hard. Sita. One and only Sita. Brother, you're a government employee, right? Yes, MP sir. Is there any compensation if government employee dies? Yes, MP sir. - Is it? Why are you still watching? Go ahead. Sir, should I shoot? - Do you have common sense? You know my heart skipped beating with the sound of bullet, right? You know I underwent bypass surgery, right? Do it calmly with knife. No, sir.. no, sir. Give me one week's time, sir. I'll return your money, sir. You've fooled me many times. While asking for loan... ...you begged me and made me a hero. You're making me a villain when I'm asking for money strictly. Come with cash. Else you won't be seen. Go without making sound. Bypass! - Thank you, MP sir. Thank you. How nice it would have been if we had... ...fake identity for our health, similar to our properties. Hello my brother-in-law with fake identity. Brother-in-law... - Are you coming just now? How is your health, brother-in-law? Doctors have assured me saying there is no danger... ...to my health when I've a fake person like you with me. Brother-in-law, it is...it is... The 10 crores that you gave for Real estate... Yes? - They are locked, brother-in-law. Brother-in-law, you have caused Tsunami... ...when I talked about fake identity. I trusted a person... ...and gave him 10 crores, brother-in-law. What did he give you? Brother-in-law, it is crores of rupees and not lakhs to keep quiet. I tried every possible way, brother-in-law. He said to do whatever I can. I came for you couple of times. They told me that you went to Hyderabad for heart surgery. What's his name, brother-in-law? Peketi Baburao. What does he do? - He's a civil contractor, brother-in-law. Tell me where he stays. He stays here in Kakinada. At present he went to Pithapuram on farm work. Okay. Lord Satyanarayana... ...I made a vow to come to you with family. Even if I ask them, they don't seem to come to you. I'm unable to fulfill your vow. Forgive me, Lord. Consider these five flowers... ...as my children and bless them, Lord. See how nice the necklace is, better than the dress. Hi uncle. Hi aunt. - Hi Santosh. Hi. - Hi uncle. - Hi. You know something? - What? There's a grand sale of gold-coated jewellery in Annavaram. Rold-gold jewellery? - No, aunt. Gold-coated! They look similar to real gold. What's the difference between both? Actually... - You wait. I'll tell. To buy gold... treasure box gets emptied. If you buy rold-gold, colour fades away in two days. Oh! - Gold-coated jewellery looks similar to original gold. If I cover up more than this then our plan will get revealed. Why does he talk of cover up and plan? - The matter is... If we get a cover with a proper plan... ...it will be enough. Hey, they will get it. Oh! All aunts are coming, so if you, sister and uncle come... Aunt, your neck looks empty without any jewellery. You look like... Goddess Laxmi without any jewellery. Okay. She had fallen. - You're all going, right? What's the need for us? - You're no ordinary woman. Do one thing. Click photos of the jewellery and send on WhatsApp. I'll chose from them and ping you back, you can buy them. Okay? - Why should we delay further? Come. Okay, aunt. Tit for tat! Hey! So we're buying the jewellery of your aunt's choice. No. We'll buy the good ones and send aunt the bad ones. Oh my dear nephew! Talk slowly. Else your aunt might hear us. Yes, she might hear us. Let's go. I'm not such a fool. Santosh! One minute. We too will come to Annavaram. Why do you take risk? Is he a great economist? - He's guru of all economists. Where does he stay? - Annavaram. Lord Satyanarayana. Make a vow that you'll donate some profit from your share. Your share values will increase immediately. If not then ask me. - Is it? When should we go? - Tomorrow. Yes, aunt? - Okay, Santosh. I'll come. Colostrums milk. I like colostrums milk very much. I ate it many years ago. Uncle, can I ask you something? What? - We're facing lot of troubles for doing the registration, right? Grandmother made a vow that she will visit Annavaram if it happens immediately. I told her it is not possible as Bangalore uncle is very busy... ...so postpone it. - Why did you tell her like that? Let's go tomorrow if registration were to happen immediately. You make vows, you visit temples, you gain virtues... ...why should we become sinners? We had functions till yesterday and now we should visit temples? Will you come to call us all the time? Doesn't you and your grandmother have any other work? We can go back and do our work if our work here is finished. You came to enjoy your summer holidays it seems. You and your father are same. Tiger lifts it tail if the ring master is a fool. Uncle, should I ask you something? You always say that I and my father are same, right? Ever did you get a thought to become like our grandfather? Do you still remember this cycle? We went to movies on this. Correct! - Greetings. Greetings. Have it. - Look... Every movie we watched in childhood... ...would run for 100 years you know. That's true! You would watch lot of English movies in childhood. I think you married a foreign lady. Yes, it's a love marriage. I'm settling down in US. What are you kids studying? I didn't plan for kids yet. What is it? If we settle down well then they will have good future. So I took some time. It's quite common there. What common! Marriage means unison of two lives to give birth to a new life. Nowadays it means to give birth to a new creature. It's the age of Kali. Are you happy? Did you make any property? Not many but somewhat. Own house and a small vehicle. There are two more which are better than these two. Kids! - Yes, father! They are my wealth and world. I don't realise how time is spent with them. What's your name? - Ravi. My name. Yes, I gave him your name. I didn't find a best friend and good name than you so I gave him your name. Where is your mother? - Mother is inside. What is she cooking? Bye. - Hey, eat and go. I've work, I'll come again. Bye. - Bye, uncle. Bye, dear. - Bye, uncle. Thanks. Thanks for what? Ravi! All these years I thought happiness lies in earning. Children and the love shared with them! How couldn't I realise it is in it? What a stupid I am! Brother-in-law... Hey, why did you come at this hour? - Why will I come at this hour? To learn rhymes from you. - She's drunk. It won't look good if mother sees. - Oh! You gave a hint, right? Your safety is important. - Thank you. - Okay. Be careful. - Okay... Why is she closing the door? Steady Sita, steady! Are you drunk? - I came by drinking. Don't you have brothers? - No. She's sloshed. - Now tell me, brother-in-law. You love me, right? Me and you? Swear on it and say that you don't love me. - Since when are you drinking? Okay, I'll believe then. On this? - Yes. Will you believe? - Yes. I swear on this and say... ...I don't have any feelings on you. Okay? Go away! - Brother-in-law, you are caught. I'm talking of love... ...but why are you talking of feelings. Anyway, aren't there girls in Hyderabad? You want Kakinada girl? - What's this nuisance? Sita, you're very drunk. Let's go. Let's go out. - Why are you pushing me away? Why are you afraid like girls? Be bold like me. You're crossing your limits. Let's go. Come. - Naughty! Mother will come, you leave. Please! You have it inside, say it... brother-in-law. Go! Hope nobody has seen. My God! I must keep beers and wines inside fridge... ...and not fruits and vegetables if I marry her. Why didn't brother-in-law get exposed despite my best acting? Sita! Boost! Coming, mother. Ugh! Non-stop Annavaram! It won't stop anywhere. Come and sit! You're always fast. Why are you walking slowly, English aunt? Come. Come on dear. - Thanks, Ravi. Why is your face looking like a kid going to school on Monday morning? It would have been nice if elder uncle's family too had come. I'm unable to fulfill grandmother's wish. No! Wow! Sir... You'll come after two days, right? - We're going to Annavaram. Why will it take two days? We'll return by evening. What will you do if we don't come for two days? Not that they'll do something, they shouldn't do anything. We won't be there for two days so they want to have fun. He doesn't have mind but reads mind very well. What? What? What are you thinking of? You don't have any chance. Elder uncle's family is there inside, look after their needs. Go! - Oh God! You don't exist. Uncle, you have phone, right? Slowly, aunt. - That's okay. Why is it so heavy? What are you carrying? Elder uncle will not come, let's go. Hope some miracle takes place at the last minute. Don't feel sad, let's go. Right! Right! Hey fatty uncle! Isn't there any entertainment? Why is it not there? We'll play songs here, you go on top and dance. Full entertainment! - So you're first. I'm also last. I not fatty uncle or something. I'm just uncle. Is there any entertainment or not? Don't you understand anything until I say it twice? You running nose! You fool! Who has stopped auto in the middle of the road? Move! Why do you talk to him? Run over the auto. Santosh! Come and see. We too are coming to temple. Our car broke down in between... move. Telling lies. Miracle happened! High five! Lord Satyanarayana, entire family has come by your grace. You've fulfilled your vow by yourself. You've proved to be a truthful God. First chapter of the story. Now I'm going to tell the story of Lord Satyanarayana. Listen carefully. In olden days, in Naimisharan forest... ...sages and ordinary folks lived happily. They asked the Lord presiding there... as follows. Lord, what is the penance to be done... ...so that humans can... get their wishes fulfilled. Could you please narrate us... ...and help us live... Hey, Sita is winking at you. He's seen it. You! Say sorry! What is that? - Incense sticks. What is it coming from them? - Smoke. Smoke is entering Sita's eyes and her eye-lids are blinking. So what? - Falling inside the eyes? Yes. - Like how windows make sound in rainy season. Exactly! - Super! You did a good job. - What? Smoke. Idiot seems to have found it. Oh! These humans are really... Call from office... - Prayers are going on. All of them kept going... Look at your dad. Prayers are going on... People are busy with phones but he's into them all the time. Uncle is back to work again. Stop! End of 5th chapter! I couldn't see your marriage. I feel like watching your marriage with these prayers. Be happy with kids. Even God gives boon only upon asking. But you're giving so many boons to grandmother even without her asking. I feel like watching his marriage. Yes. Touch the feet. Give my name to your daughter. Where is brother, sister-in-law? He's attending a phone call. He'll be back soon. Move aside! Brother-in-law, wife should always stay by her husband, right? I think she became mad after entering the temple. Why were you winking at me during the prayers? I didn't do. - You did. I didn't. - Go away. What is this new game? Fresh plan? None of it! Don't you remember something with this? Move aside! I gave this teddy bear to you in childhood, right? - Yes. Look Sita, I don't suit for your attitude and behaviour. Leave me. - Brother-in-law. Anyway, you wrote it in letter in childhood, right? I'm repeating the same now. Not my vow, PA. I came for my daughter's vow. I never said no to my daughter. Sita is the reason why elder uncle came to temple. Later on Mr. Venkatrao called up and said he'll buy five flats. Did you bring elder uncle to the temple? - Yes. Why? - Wherever Santosh is there, happiness should follow. Okay, why didn't you tell me that you're bringing elder uncle? Will you love me only if I bring your uncle? Go away! Roadside stall! Sita, please wait a minute. I love you, Sita. You know something? Sravya told me everything. Is it? You idiot! You fooled me again. I love you so much, brother-in-law. I love you. Hold on! Grandmother's house has come! Get down! 112 packets to eat today. Did you bring the offering? Didn't you eat food so that you can eat offering? Don't throw punches. - I've already distributed them. Only this is left. Lick it. - What is this? You're wonderful! Get down. Be careful. What? Brother, what about real estate... - Let's go to the village meeting. Meeting? What's the need to go there now, uncle? I spoke to all the village elders, they're all coming there. They are telling us to come. Suryarao is also coming. Okay, brother. Let's decide something today. Let's go. Where to go? The other day you created a ruckus in secret meeting. That was enough. No, brother... - No, dear. This is what happens if women are given power. They spoil everything. Men will go. Come guys. - Okay. Decide something today. It's been two week since our shop is shut. Okay, okay. Come. Why are you watching with a blank face? Come. - Don't scold in front of everyone. Come. - No. Don't know what grandfather Suryarao will talk. I'm feeling tensed. You don't feel tensed, nothing will happen. Hello! The other day you said you will decide at Registrar office, right? Why don't you talk now? Ask 20 acres. What? 20 acres? You folks will not agree. - That's why I told him to ask. Yes. - Mr. President. I looked after their fields till now. I never cheated them anytime. What's there to ask? Tell them to give 20 acres. I'll manage. Is it? - Mr. Baburao. You don't get angry, wait for some time. Look Suryarao, your demand is not good. Ask something else. Ask 50 lakhs. Speak up, Suryarao. What are you thinking? Sir, if they find it difficult to give the fields... ...tell them to give 50 lakhs cash. 50 lakhs? You worked for us all these years and now giving us trouble. 50 lakhs. - That's great! Okay, we will arrange 50 lakhs. We will do the registration tomorrow. Suryarao, are you happy? Let there be no dispute in future? They said they will give what you asked for. This is the final word. Everything is finished. Registration tomorrow. They will go back. Registration should be done tomorrow at any cost. Why should we wait till tomorrow? Matter will be settled if we give it today itself. I think 50 lakhs is a good deal. You want money? Tell me how much. - Keep it. Keep your money in your pocket. This matter won't get settled with money. Yes. What very good deal, uncle? He said no to money at registrar office. He asked for 20 acres at meeting. He agreed for 50 lakhs within half an hour. If we wait for another two days... he will say 20. If we wait for four days... He will say 10. - But I think this process will take time, uncle. I feel 50 lakhs is the best deal. I don't think so. Anyway, it's late. Let's wait for another few days. Why should we give him so much money? What do you say, brother? - Yes, uncle. How can he fix the rate when the fields belong to us? Uncle, should I talk to elder uncle once? Let's go. Brother, come here. One minute. - Okay. 50 lakhs is too much, brother. - Hey. We can get rid of it with 50 lakhs. Why should we continue further? Brother, we both don't like to give 50 lakhs. You too think. We'll deal differently after few days. Anyway fields belong to us. Why is he fixing the rate? True, it's more, right? - Yes. It didn't strike me. Let's wait further. - Baburao sir, any problem? No...it's a big amount... We'll discuss with the women of the family and let you know. Greetings. - Baburao sir... What happened to him? - Let's go. Leave immediately. Sister, this dispute is not getting settled. It would have been good if it got settled soon. We can go to our place. Janaki! - Yes. Please come here. - Okay. Keep Santosh's clothes inside the cupboard. Janaki! - Yes, mother. My necklace. How come it is in his cupboard? Didn't he give it to me after finding it inside the dung? Why didn't you give me the necklace after you found it? Tell me why you hide it. - Aunt, I didn't hide it. I kept it away from me. Yes, I'm asking why. I'm checking whether rack's value would increase or not if I keep it inside. What? - Yes, aunt. You give importance to people who wear jewellery. You didn't wear necklace all these days. Did you become any less important? Will your importance increases if you wear it now? Aunt, I'm not saying not to value gold. Between gold and silver, we'll choose gold to be important. If asked to choose between gold and humans, we need to choose only humans. Aunt, I could have told this when necklace was found. But you were not in a position to listen then. Grandmother gave you bangles and you tested them to find if its gold or not. Had grandmother learnt about it then she would have definitely felt sad. Aunt, you would have lost your respect. Grandmother gave you gold for not to make you look pretty. She wanted you to feel happy by seeing it. I run a local general store. I had cheap thoughts in mind. Commodities have prices. But I've understood that humans have values. It is not sufficient to possess 10 grams of gold. I've learnt that our attitude should be similar to gold. Forgive me, Santosh. Stop it, aunt. Thanks. It will calve in two hours. I'll go and check Sundaramma's cow in the neighbourhood. Okay. - Hello. Hello. - Hello! Ramana! - Hello! I'm better than this doctor. Shut up! - Who is that guy? Do we need a doctor for calving? I'll do it if you tell me. What will you do? - What will I do? I'm similar to a doctor. It was good that I failed Bi.P.C. Else I too would have become a doctor. How will you do it? - Why do you ask like that? Like humans, animals also have a body language. Hell with you! You don't know the language but talking of body language. Hey, listen to me! Doing hypnotism to humans... What was that? - Hypnotism. Huh? - Got it? I won't forget it now. We take control of them with it... ...we can do the same thing on animals and bring them under our control. This is called understanding therapy. Is it? - I'll do it now, you watch. Watch carefully and learn. Critical operation! Don't bat your eye-lid. Don't turn your face. Look here. Turn towards me. Look into my eyes. Don't move. Turn your face. Look at me. Relax! Don't feel tensed with me. Be cool! Got it? Yes! Now you are there. Just start the operation. Please co-operate and understand. Buffalo will get frightened. You don't threaten me unnecessarily. Go back. Observe what is happening. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! - Is this our therapy? Come on! Come on! Ugh! Why do you say like that? Poison comes first. See what happens now. Look at there. Come on! You should assist the cow to calve, not bull. You've insulted me. Hey, come, come. What did I tell you and what are you doing? Your work will be done. Do some antics. Okay? I'm there, I will save your child. I'll also give a good name. God bless you. Gods must be crazy. Hey, see the calf now. Hey! You proceed! I didn't ask for dung. Calf! Calf! Come on! You! Bangalore uncle? Ugh! I think this cow didn't empty its bowel from two days. Bangalore uncle laughed for the first time and the cow got frightened. Dung on his face! Uncle... - I laughed after so many years. I laughed suddenly... Uncle, I remember well... ...that you laughed and made everyone laugh in childhood. Uncle, by leaving your laugh... ...why did you get disconnected from family. Yes, I used to laugh and make everyone laugh once. Staff in office wouldn't work when I made them laugh. I would then talk with anger and they would work. I stopped laughing after that. Tension increased in life. Interest on family became less. After many years... ...you brought back my laugh. Thanks a lot. If we leave the tensions from office outside the house... ...then we don't need to give up laughing. Photos are beautiful if we laugh for a second. Only one life, uncle. How beautiful it will be if we spend it with laugh. Don't know when your father names you as Santosh... ...laughter and joy can be seen in your face. Smile exists inside everyone, it's there in this village and also house. Show your laugh to your family and everyone. Santosh. - Yes. You brought the smile from t-shirt to my face. I'll never let it go away. Promise. Uncle.. Keerthi... For you, dear. For you my darling! I bought earrings long back for you. I couldn't find time so this delay. Your grandmother got it done. I couldn't even attend the function though I was here only. Hope you forgive me. Take it, dear. Thank you, daddy. Are you happy now? Ravi. - Yes. Brother, what brings you here? Any work? - Yes. You need to forgive me and I need to bless you. I couldn't attend your wedding with the excuse of distance. I couldn't see your celebrations. Sorry. - No need to say sorry, brother. I wish to bless you now if you don't mind. Sandra. - Yes. God bless you! How could you live so far when you have so much love inside? Uncle, shall I ask you a small matter? You would buy t-shirts and give money to US uncle in my childhood, right? Yes. My father would give him money to buy clothes. He would watch movies with that money. I used to buy him clothes because your grandfather would scold him if he knew it. Uncle, in spite of knowing it you would go to movie as if you knew nothing, right? Yes. Brother, don't know whether it became a habit or not but even today... ...I don't find satisfaction in the clothes that I purchase myself. I feel like giving even now too. How does he remember everything? Uncle, everything related to this house is a sweet memory to me. Should I tell you a small logic? I'm too born in this house. 'All varieties of food items...' 'Hot...' Can't stop laughing. - Yes. 'Fritters, Mysore fritters.' 'Chilli fritters.' Kalamandir. Andhra Pradesh. We can spend entire life by watching Mr. Jandhyala's movies. True. - In this life filled with tension... ...it is very difficult to laugh. In our childhood... ...we were very happy without any tensions. How nice it would be if those days come back! How nice it would be if we could get into a time-machine... ...and go back to happy days by turning on a switch, right? Those days eating, studying, watching movies... ...talking with friends. Those days are different. Now it is not possible. It is possible. Where there is a will, there is a way. Sir, we have our own minds... ...tell us the solution, sir. We can be happy anywhere and anytime. People of any age can be happy. - Tell so that we understand. Lock your age. - Lock? Your... Age. - Is it a new software? I think it's an app. It is neither a software not an app. This game is invented by Santosh to keep people happy. Made in Pithapuram. This game is not played by some machine. It is played with human minds. Lock your age means... We must have been happy previously. Bring that situation and paste it in present. That is lock your age. From ages to cooking... ...whatever you liked earlier, do it now. This concept is good. - Nice idea. Let's apply it. We all want to be happy. But is it possible practically. Yes, aunt. Can I prove now? Okay. - Okay. Ready! Let's start the game. With whom we will start? - Who else? Youngest daughter of this house, the golden lady of this house... Aunt Bangaram. No, please! - Aunt, start it. Please! Come on! 'My lock your age'... ...is the day when I decked up like a bride. My joy knew no bounds those days. Wore lot of jewellery, black spot on cheeks and vermillion on forehead... Is it, aunt? You like girl from earlier days itself? Not only from that time, during the time of 'Annaprasam' day... ...she went on touched gold first. How nice it would be if I could stay like bride forever! Wearing jewellery like that... ...and watching myself in the mirror... ...I wouldn't feel hungry or get sleep. I felt very happy. Aunt Bangaram, your 'lock your age'. Mother, give your jewellery too. Look at sister, she looks like a golden doll. Right? Yes. - In greed of gold... I got separated... ...from such sweet people for so many years. Forgive me. - Get up, dear. Don't cry. Sister. - Why are you crying like a small girl? Calm down! Calm down I say. So aunt Bangaram, whenever you want to be happy... ...apply 'lock your age'. Now the king of our house. Eldest uncle. My God! What will he do now? Is it, dear? It's my age, my mind and my wish. Why should I lock as you say? Lock your age? You and your useless games. He won't change. No, no. Aunt, now tell your 'lock your age'. My happiest days are those... ...which I spent with my brothers. Mostly on Rakhi festival. Elder brother would give some gift. Second brother would give jokes book. But he didn't know what to give... ...he would tie thread to grass flowers and gave it as bouquet. First time when my brother called me as sister... ...the happiness I felt... ...I didn't experience it even when my son called me as mother. Mother made me cry with sentiment. Your concept is great. So now the one and only... US uncle. My 'lock your age' is my Intermediate days. We started on bicycle at Pithapuram... ...and stopped directly in Kakinada at Saytyagouri theatre. I wouldn't remember the steps in maths formula... ...but the steps of Chiranjeevi... I remembered them perfectly. One incident I cannot forget in my life. Once while returning after watching Chiranjeevi's 'Gharanamogudu' movie.. Principle sir! Let's go. Hey! Stop! Good morning... good morning, sir. How was the movie? - Sir, I'll... You are watching movies back to back. You are giving proxy attendance. Go home. Your father will show you a good action movie. Move aside! - Sir... - Useless fellow! I thought I was finished that day... Father would remove my skin if he found out. I wanted to run away to some place. But I didn't have enough courage to escape by leaving everyone. I came home with lot of fear. Thief is caught. What did grandfather say? What will he say? He must have beat him black and blue. Yes, uncle? Ravi... - Father... Why are you afraid? You're studying all the time. Sometimes go to movies. Take this money and go for movie. Mad boy! I still don't understand why father behaved like that. Grandmother, you must have cast some spell. Tell what happened. Grandmother, we should know it right now. Yes! Listen, your younger son is bunking classes and watching movies. He is studying well. He studied all night so I only told him to go for movie. Don't know if you are aware or not, our priest checked his horoscope... ...and said he alone is lucky enough to go to America from our family. Don't say anything to him. I know the concept of 'Lock your age'. Now I'll watch every movie that gets released in US. Now the king of Bangalore. Bangalore uncle! Will he tell us directly or take everyone into conference call? Fatty! - Yes. - I'll hit you with cell phone. I got it, uncle. Continue. - My 'lock your age' time. 8th class. I loved mother very much. I was always behind her. Tomorrow is my daughter's baby shower ceremony. Mrs. Sitamahalaxmi, you should definitely attend. Okay. - Come without fail. Okay. - Greetings. - Greetings. Mother. - Yes? What is baby shower ceremony? Their daughter... - Yes. ...is going to give birth to a boy or girl. - Okay. That's why they are celebrating baby shower ceremony. Then baby shower ceremony should take place in our house too. Why? - Our bull is going to calve in few days. How come bull birth to a calf? This is strange! Though it was a small matter... ...she would think wisely. Are you happy now? I'm very happy, mother. I entered history books for conducting baby shower ceremony to an animal. Now the princess of Pithapuram. Mrs. Sitamahalaxmi. Grandmother's 'lock your age' must have been from our childhood days. No, no, it must be during her young age. No, it must be after marriage. Isn't it, grandmother? Stop your options. Grandmother, you tell. In my life... ...real happiness... ...was when I saw you all... ...after 20 years in front of me. Grandmother is the key person behind all our 'lock our age' concept. One selfie from these celebrations. Super! Smile! - Click! Who is laughing inside? Yes! Aunt, come this side. Hi! I'm very happy. Be like this always. I think there is some point in the concept he talked about. Let's test it and see. What will I lose? I'll tie! I'll tie! Ready? There! Here! There! - Sister! Here! Right! Right! Catch! I'm very happy. All have changed. I can see that happiness in your face. - Elder uncle too has changed. But he is not showing it outside. I didn't slap you for stopping the registration. For not telling us that registration was done 20 years ago. Registration was done 20 years ago? Yes. I think everyone knows the matter. They got attracted towards you like a magnet. They don't know that you are going to fool them. Aunt... please, aunt. Aunt... please...please. One day, aunt. Aunt? Get in. - Uncle. Uncle, at least you tell. It is okay if you don't make us laugh. It is not good to make us cry. Uncle, one day... Please, uncle. - I didn't expect you to do this. Shame on you! Uncle! Please, uncle! Stay for one day. After that I'll never enter this house anytime. Swear on me! Please, uncle. Please! - Why one day? So you want to usurp the entire property... ...after killing us if we stay for another day? You've learnt very well from your father as how to ruin others dreams. After all you and your father are same. Why are you feeling sad? Forgive me, grandmother. - Why should I forgive you? Since I told you that I want to spend few days with everyone... ...that you went to everyone and got insulted. Should I forgive for that? My second daughter is fond of gold... ...and you searched her necklace... ...inside the dung. Should I forgive you for that? My second son ignored his wife and children... ...but you made him love his family. How many should I tell? I said I made a vow to God. You not only took everyone to Annavaram... ...and made me watch my third son's marriage again. For a person to be happy property is not needed... ...but memories and experiences. You said it in English. You took everyone 20 years back. But you took my 100 years ahead. For making you win by hiding you behind me in your childhood. You are standing in front of me now... ...and gave me lot of happiness. Why did you do it for me? In childhood, summer holidays... ...Dussehra holidays and Sankranthi holidays... ...are meant to spend at grandmother's house, I felt happy for it. But I used to feel very sad... ...that I couldn't visit grandmother's house. Grandmother means love. Father means respect. My life got crushed between these two for 20 years. That's why I came to this village by searching for happiness. Grandmother, it is enough if you are there for me, I can be happy. But for you to be happy... ...I had learnt that they all are needed. That's why I made them stay for 20 days. Grandmother, how did everyone come to know... ...that registration was already done. - Just now... Suryarao came. Greetings, madam. Please listen to me once. Registration of fields was done 20 years back. Sir came to me a day before he passed away. He gave me the registration papers and left. He said if your children find out about registration... ...then they will make you an orphan. So he told me not to tell you. He told me to give these papers when you all are happy. I came and saw the other day, you all were very happy. That's why I came to give these papers, madam. Did he think so greatly... ...20 years back? Your grandson made me do all this. Take it, son. - What is it, grandfather? Property registration was done 20 years back. Grandfather did it when he was alive. Grandfather, if family members find out that registration is done... ...then they will leave right now. Keep these papers with you. Madam, forgive me... ...for giving you trouble all these years. It's okay, Suryarao. - Greetings, madam. Greetings. Grandmother, had everyone stayed for one more day then it would have been nice. Enough! You made everyone stay for 20 days. You gave me lot of happiness. Now I'm at peace. Forgive me, grandmother. It would have been nice had they stayed for one day. Why? Tomorrow is grandfather's death anniversary. You fulfilled so many wishes without my asking. Will you fulfil one last wish? What is it, grandmother? You conduct my funeral rites. Stop it, mother. Calm down! I'm not sad that you didn't tell me that registration was done 20 years back. Santosh, now I'm telling you. You're 100 percent gold. 100 percent gold. I love you. It is enough if every grandmother has a grandson like you. It is enough if there is one like you. Sita! Your father became A1 contractor. Nobody can stop. That's it! What is it? Who is putting fences in our fields? Hey! Who are you? Who are you? - Your best friend. You told me to go and tell anybody, right? He is my boss. - MP sir? Sir, you should save me. Hey! - Sir? - Round up him... ...and then put fences in his fields. Dear! Let's sit and watch. - Okay, brother-in-law. Hey! Don't make sound. Finish off Peketi Baburao with a knife. Okay, sir. Who is he? - Don't know, brother-in-law. What are you watching here? You too go. Hello son! Stop it. I don't know who you are. He didn't pay me 10 crores so... ...I'm getting him thrashed. Why are you beating my boys? I don't know what your matter is... ...but I'll not keep quiet if something happens to my uncle in front of me. Peketi Baburao is your uncle! Not for me. I'm a heart patient. - Stop the car. I thought of finishing the work without causing sound pollution. But to handle you... ...I have to hold the gun. For your kind information... With silencer. Who is he showing his back to me? Brother-in-law, Baburao seems to have many fans. Look, first kill him and then others will fall in life. My God! What brother-in-law? Why did you beat me like that? I went around the world with this heart. All doctors gave up. But you came forward... ...and saved my life by taking huge risk. How should I repay your favour, doctor? There isn't anything to repay in this. I did my duty, that's it. MP sir, you just relax. Take this blank cheque and write as much as you want. Please! MP sir, I told you that I did my duty, that's it. Okay, bye. Doctor sir, how come you are here? Yes, MP sir. He is my brother-in-law. Sorry, doctor. Hey... I'm sparing your life because of doctor. That boy behind you... He's my son. - Sorry, son. He's taken after you. He is always first in saving his people. Don't ever do this stupid work. Live a honest life. Doctor sir, thank you. - That's okay. - Thank you, son. Brother-in-law. - Yes? What about the 10 crores.... Hey, I'm alive today... ...and my family is happy, it is all because of this doctor. Forget the 10 crores. - I'll follow you. Forgive me, brother-in-law. - Stop it, brother-in-law. No formalities between us. I used to scold him every day. He tolerated me. I beat him too. But still he came to save me. I knew that you value relationships but... ...I couldn't realize that you could sacrifice your life. You and your father are same. Same! Let's go home, brother-in-law. Come. - Come. Wait a minute. - Yes, daddy. I'll ask you something. You won't say no, right? Daddy, I'll say yes even before you ask. My sweet girl! I mean... You...you should marry your brother-in-law. Him? He is not fit to run a roadside stall! No, no. I know you both don't get along. But you should marry him. Please! I don't know what you will do. You should marry brother-in-law. Please! Please! Don't say no. - Okay. I agree because of you. Oh! Thanks, dear. Thanks! Lord Satyanarayana! She's doing over action. - She's very happy. Sister... Forgive me, sister. Brother... I forgot everything when you called me as sister. What's there to forgive? What happened? Nothing, mother. Dear, bring first-aid box. Quick! I wouldn't have survived without my brother-in-law... ...and nephew today. Mother! I'm calling you, mother. I called you, mother. Yourself! Mother... Forgive me, brother. Forgive me. - Calm down! Calm down! Mother... Do you have sunnundalu (Andhra snacks)? - Yes, I have. Forgive me, aunt. I trouble you for 20 years. Hey, don't say like that. Come inside. Mother! - Mother! We couldn't go by leaving this love behind. Mother, I wish to stay with you for few more days. Why are you standing there? Come! Come! - Mother! Come! Come! Come. Finally his soul is at peace after 20 years. Yes. - What else can make you happier than this. True. Hey roadside stall! When are we getting married? Are you an angel? Forget the marriage! Go away! No, don't run it off. You brought my five children to me. Let it remain as your memory. As we expected, this grandson took initiative... ...in bringing back the happiness lost by grandmother for 20 years... ...in 20 days and made grandmother win. By the way, are you also going to... ...your grandmother's house during summer holidays? If you are not going then at least go now. Just lock your age. After our house... ...the only house which we can call as ours. 'Grandmother's house'. Tell me, officer. Why didn't you come yet? - I will not come now. Why? - I've learnt few things. What is that? Our hunger gets quenched if we drink water... ...but our thirst won't get quenched if we eat food, I've learnt this. What about your A1 position? Forget the position and project. Hang up! Nonsense! Action! Like this... Continue! Raju! Agreement? Cut it! Ready. Dialogue is over. What is that? Cut it! Superb!
