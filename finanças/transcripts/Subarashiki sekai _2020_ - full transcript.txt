Are you a little nervous? Even a veteran inmate like you. Breakfast? After serving out a sentence, for some reason, I can't eat before I'm released. Don't worry. You can soon eat whatever you want. It's not too late to start over. - Step out. - Yes, sir. Attention. Left, face. Proceed. Salute. It's rusty. It looks expensive. Around 300,000 yen back then. We don't send your watch to get it serviced during your sentence. You can get rid of it. Sent your things to Tokyo? Yes. All clear. Thank you. Mikami, you're finally getting out. Thank you, sir! "INMATE FILES" "OFFENSE: MURDER" Incarcerated in 2004. Now back to society after 13 years. Yes, sir. I hope you stay out of places like this from now on. Yes, sir. How do you feel about the crime you committed? Remorse toward the victim? Yes. I regret it. Getting locked up for that hoodlum. So you do feel remorse. I still think it was an unfair verdict. He attacked us with a sword. It was a gang war, wasn't it? I was a lone wolf and didn't belong to any family then! In any case... I hope you're sorry about taking a man's life. It's no use debating this with you. Get changed. Yes, sir! Removing my clothes! Hands up. Other side. "ASAHIKAWA PRISON" Don't come back again. I won't. Not even if you asked. We won't. We're glad to get rid of you. Thank you for everything. Take care. Don't lose your temper. Go straight home, you hear? Goodbye. Screw you. No more yakuza. No more life of crime. This time I'll go straight once and for all. You have a package. "INMATE FILES" Inmate Files? It contains all sorts of info about the inmate. Background, criminal history, behavior in prison. Everything about each inmate. Masao Mikami, 10 convictions, 6 incarcerations. Convicted of murder. The inmates aren't allowed to see them. But he got violent with the guards time and time again. He invoked his defendant's rights in the trials to copy the contents. He sent them to us as an in-depth record about his life. He wan ts us to find his mother in a people-search program. Don't take him seriously. He's not TV material. That's why he'll be so good. A man like him mends his ways and makes a tearful reunion with his mother. But... he murdered someone, right? Yeah. He's a murderer. Ms. Yoshizawa. You see... I quit... The production company to write a novel. You have a lot of talent. But how are you supporting yourself? He's a career criminal. Watching him up close might give you new ideas. You have the contact info of the lawyer, his sponsor. - Mikami! - Yes! After my illness 3 years ago, we sold the house. This place is small, but you're welcome to stay until you find an apartment. Mr. Mikami. Go ahead and eat the meat. Don't you like sukiyaki? I love it. Thank you for cooking for me. He hasn't had a hot meal in 13 years. This is too soon. He has to ease back into things. Don't you? But meat is the source of energy. Every strong person eats meat. Don't believe everything you see on TV. I heard it on the radio. I apologized to my newborn baby. Women are putting up their children for adoption through online agencies. He had a family of his own. And my career was getting off the ground. I wanted my baby to grow up in a loving environment. What do you think? These women sold and abandoned their children. Rather than ruining both their lives, they wished the best for their kids. Still... they shouldn't be given away like pets. There are women who get pregnant without... For Mr. Mikami... it's personal. I'm sure my mother came to get me. But I'd run away from the facility. I see... I'm sure not a day went by when your mother didn't think about you. - Mikami. - Yes? It's kind of like my hobby to sponsor former convicts. You don't owe me anything. The important thing for you is to regain your love and trust in other people. I'll do whatever I can. Don't hesitate to ask for help whenever you need it. Another serving? Do you want noodles instead? Ma'am, I'm fine... What's the matter? What's wrong? What is it? What's wrong? The inmate's birth and family background. He was born out of wedlock in Fukuoka. No other records about his birthplace. His mother was a geisha in Fukuoka. She became pregnant by her lover... who never acknowledged his paternity, hence the son has no family registry. He lost contact with his mother when he was around 4... while under the care of an orphanage. He started running away when he was around 11, and stepped foot into the underworld. He started working for a crime family in western Japan, helping its gambling and loan shark enterprises. June 1974. He was sent to juvie. He was 14. He was trained in woodwork, welding, and tailoring. "APPLICATION FOR WELFARE BENEFITS" "APPLICATION FOR WELFARE BENEFITS" "Released from prison on Feb. 20." "Released from prison on Feb. 20." "I suffer from an illness and have no support from family." What did you do before your prison sentence? Members of anti-social organizations are not eligible for benefits. Anti-social? Gangs and yakuza. Are you one of them? I'm a lone wolf... We'll come out clean. He was a member of yakuza over 20 years ago. If we don't help men like him, we might as well direct them back into the world of organized crime. You know that. We'll try and see. He's treating me like trash. It's his job to be suspicious. I can't believe I have to live on welfare. Don't beat yourself up about it. It's your right as a citizen. At least I didn't have to feel small in prison. Don't say that. Are you okay?! Don't get up. Blood pressure 230/138. I'm surprised you were able to walk in here by yourself. These figures show a high risk of heart attack and stroke. Doctor... Am I too unhealthy to live in society? There's no need to be pessimistic. Get some rest and we'll try to manage your condition. Mr. Mikami. I'm Tsunoda, the director. "INMATE FILES" I was first convicted when I was 16. This? Yeah. We wreaked havoc and escaped from juvie. "The boys became violent, and numerous guards were injured." Next, I was 19. A bodyguard for the big boss. I was slashed and ended up getting 44 stitches. Right here. See? Did you think about life after prison? That's all I thought about. But the more I thought, the more I confused I got. Life behind bars is the same every day. I had no idea how people lived outside, or what I could do. My mind went blank. Where does this go? - By the wall. - Okay. Hello, there. Ma'am. Sewing machine. - Boy, was it heavy. - Thank you. For you. Is it finished? It's lovely. The only one in the world. Very nice. I want a job making kendo protective gear. Kendo as in the martial art? Yes. In the prison factory, I hand-stitched high-end items of deer skin. I can work here with all this space. Here? Where I won't get into fights. I don't mean to brag, but the imperial family uses the masks that I made. Is there work like that nowadays? I don't know... You're quite talented. Soy sauce... there. - Hold on. - Yes? - Any cans? - Yes. You have to separate them. Okay. Thank you. Hello. Thanks. I was busy moving into my new apartment. I told you to get some rest. An unhealthy lifestyle will put you back in the hospital. But working on a sewing machine... It's your responsibility, not mine, to follow my medical advice. Andy, good move. Hello. Hello! Will you keep it down? Do you know what time it is? This is yours, right? It's not even separated. Think about your neighbors. We'll take it out in the morning. Yo, yo, yo... What the hell do you want? You live upstairs? These guys work hard all day long. There's no harm in doing it for them. If you're that busy, you should get some sleep. - Sorry. - We'll clean it up. We're 100% sorry. Don't apologize, idiot. He gets to live off your taxes for sitting on his ass. The landlord accepts tenants from all walks of life. You. Step outside and repeat what you just said to me. I'm talking to you! Gorilla man, get your ass over here. Let's not disturb your friends. I'll skip the formalities. I'm Masao Mikami, also known as the Brawler of Kobe. In prison, I met some bosses from this region of Japan. Which one do you work for? Is he a yakuza? Which family are you from? Give me a break. I finally left the family... I can't hear you. Say it loud and clear! I can't. Let's keep the family out of this. They won't like it... Just tell me which family you're from! All it takes is one phone call! Help! I'm being threatened by a gangster! He's trying to extort money from an innocent citizen! You're full of shit! I left that life behind! Shut up! We're trying to sleep! I don't want your damn money! The yakuza business is dead! You moron! Keep it down! They're scaring me. I understand but... "KENDO GEAR MAKERS" I understand, but... It takes a craftsman a month to make a chest plate. For 150,000 yen a piece. It won't pay the bills. By the way, where were you trained? I worked in a factory... Which one? In Sasebo... You mean, the prison? This is just a routine home visit. You keep your place tidy. I had years of practice being neat and tidy. Please help yourself, sir. I can't accept things that were bought with welfare benefits. Always a public telephone? Yes. No cellphone? Am I allowed? Public phones are inconvenient for job hunting. Are you fit enough to work? I don't mean to rush you. Once you have an income, you'll get that much less benefits. I want to work to support myself. Not for extra spending money! Sorry. No... I'm sorry. For not respecting your efforts to find a job. I'll do whatever I can to help you. Someone I call "sir" apologizing to me... You don't have to call me "sir". Okay? You can use the benefits as you see fit. If you get a cellphone, give me your number. Stay in touch with other people, and don't isolate yourself from society. All right. Scaffolders, the stars of construction work. 220,000 to 550,000 yen a month. Web designer. EC site design. What's that? Kindergarten bus driver. People in 50s, welcome. Light-freight truck driver. Any experience acceptable. Wanted, chauffeurs. We hire many seniors. Delivery truck driver. High income with regular driver's license. A driving job is good. You can stay seated. And work alone. You have a license? I used to drive the imports. It expired when I was in prison. I have to get it re-issued. How did you make a living before when you got out? I made connections inside. I sometimes went to work for those bosses. Why? Because... it was easy. They don't ask questions, or look down on me. Physically dangerous, but mentally comfortable. Any sense of guilt? What was that? Those jobs must have entailed criminal acts. Like what? Selling drugs. Carrying guns, making threats, drowning people. You watch too many movies. But illegal, more or less. No sense of guilt? No. It felt good being useful. I was accepted, and treated well. Isn't it nice to be with people who appreciate you? Cool. He could be the entire show. We can only re-issue your license within 3 years of its expiration. You have to take the aptitude test and the written and practical exams... Wait. Stop. Why do I have to start all over? I never violated any traffic laws... You do have to start all over. It expired over 10 years ago. Look. I have my reasons. You could've renewed it from the prison. We send out notices. I was constantly in solitary confinement. That's your own fault. What the fuck?! Raising your voice? Ma'am... I have to earn a living. Please help me. Of course. What if I find my driver's license card? My wife should have it. - You don't live with your family? - No. We're not family. We're divorced. But... she wouldn't have thrown it away... It makes no difference. It's still expired. Passing the test in one go is very difficult. Wait. Here. A list of driving schools. I'm still alive, because he risked his life to stop the attacker. If he didn't, I'd be dead. Why not resolve the situation peacefully? My husband tried. But I was agitated, and provoked the attack. The man drew a sword on us. My husband told him to stop, and grabbed the sword. He was knocked over and almost killed. There was no time to talk. The witness will face forward. All right, then. Was there previous animosity between... It was 13 years ago. A gang member raided a hostess bar that Mikami and his wife Kumiko owned. When Mikami called an ambulance, the victim was still alive. "HOSTESS BAR OWNER ARRESTED" He didn't mean to kill him, and didn't expect a heavy sentence. You married your wife just less than a month ago. After 10 years together, you agreed to have a baby. You were about to have a real family of your own. But the victim barged in and harassed your wife. He more than harassed her. That shithead. I just wanted him to leave. I see. That's why you stabbed him 11 times? All over his body. Including his stomach and chest. Why go so far? Like I said, I was frantic. I don't remember anything. Will a person survive being stabbed 11 times with a 27 inch sword? - Maybe not, but... - You had to. Of course. It was either him or me. You knew he could die. Yes! Masao! No! The witness will remain quiet. Your Honor. The defendant kept stabbing the victim, knowing that he could die. There was willful negligence. He should be charged with murder, not manslaughter. No! Masao! - You didn't know! - Remove her! Judge, it's not true! He didn't mean to kill him! Let go off me! Masao! "MRS. KUMIKO NISHIO" I live there. Can I help you? Oh... I'm your m-- A friend of your dad. Where's your mom? Still at work. Is that right? I see. Hey. How old are you? Nine. Excuse me. You didn't pay for everything. Did you see me? Someone else did. Bring them here. I want to ask what they saw. No. I don't want you to hold a grudge against them. What would I do? I know about you. What about me? I'm the neighborhood association chairman. If you don't find anything from your store... what will you do? "DRIVING LICENSE TEXTBOOK" Stop! Forget this happened. I'm sorry. It was my mistake. What the hell...?! I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. I'm glad we got it cleared. I can't apologize to you enough. Forget about it. No problem. I have to go now. - Goodbye. - Wait... Excuse me! Wait! Stop! You forgot this! Your things. Here. Thank you. A token of my apology. - No... - Please take it. I'll walk you home. I'm sorry. Did the police contact you about me? It's obvious you're no ordinary folk. I used to be a small-time juvenile delinquent. Small-time is good. Your accent reminded me of my dad, who was really strict with me. Sorry I snapped. Where is he from? A rural town in Kyushu called Asakura. Really? That's the next town over. I'm from Chikushino. What? - Yeah? - Yeah. I see. How's your dad? He passed away. Come in. - Thank you. - Sure. You didn't have to. Don't mention it. Are you trying to get a driver's license? Huh? I saw the textbook. My license expired while I was locked up. Thank you. I can introduce you to a friend who runs a courier business. - Will you? - Yes. I used to chauffeur for club hostesses. I still know how to drive. I'll pass the test. Yeah? I hope you do. Good luck. - Thanks. - Yeah. And you can call me if a customer gives you any trouble. The police stay out of civil affairs. Like a bodyguard? I can handle guys with sticky fingers. Like this. Enough. Got it. You made your point. "Child seats are required by law, "except in times of emergency when transporting a child "to get medical care." False. Oops. It's true. True. That was a tricky question. Let's cross the street. We'll use that car. Yes, sir. Mr. Yoshida, backseat. "DRIVING TEST" Number 8! Masao Mikami! Ready for the test! Right... get in the car. Hold on. Seatbelt. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Let's go. Here I go. Change the gear. Here I go. Take a right at the next corner. No, no, no... This way. Stay calm. You're doing fine. Head to the slope. The slope! Stop here on the slope. Uphill start. Uphill start. - Sorry. - Stay calm. Slow down. Hey... Hey... Mr. Mikami! Mikami! Stop! We're done. Yellow means stop. Why did you keep going? - One more time. - It's his turn. Get off the car! Please beware of bank transfer frauds. Scam artists pretending to be your child or grandchild may call you to ask for some emergency cash... "WANTED: MALE HELP, GOOD WAGES" You mean... have sex with them? How much does it pay? The registration fee? 200,000 yen for Course A. 100,000 for Course B. Your service will be much appreciated by our gorgeous, classy ladies. Here's the account information. Ready to write it down? Tokyo Shinkai Bank, Koyo-cho branch... Shit. Sorry. You have a soft spot for women. Not for women. I have a soft spot for cash. I need the money to take driving lessons. The brawler who survived the underworld is helpless like a baby in real society. You want to go straight, but can't find a way. I brought it on myself? Well... that's one way of putting it. Listen, Tsunoda. This relates to society as a whole. Ex-convicts are shunned by society, and are often forced back into a life of crime. The public needs to be enlightened about the reality. A program about you falling into traps and overcoming obstacles will move the viewers and shed light on them. Why should I fall into traps to shed light on your viewers? It's a figure of speech. The program might even pay for your driving lessons. Wait. I wanted you to find my mom. Society today is extremely cruel to people who step off the path. One mistake, and you're essentially condemned. But even those of us who stay on the path aren't happy. So we're unforgiving. We all feel the same way you do. But we keep our mouths shut in fear of being ostracized. Prison might be the only place that won't kick you out, no matter how badly you behave. If the program is a national broadcast, it might reach your mother. This woman has balls. People in the TV business are smooth talkers. Don't let her fool you. Another drink? It's a present for my kid. I was worried. You can't disappoint him, can you? Show us what's inside. I have to go home. You made us miss our train. What's your problem, man? That's enough. You're making a scene. Mind your own business. Let's go, mister. It's over. Hey... Hey! What do you want? Hurry. Get your camera! Let's go somewhere quiet. Out of people's way. You got it. Which family are you from? Son of a bitch! Hey. No! You bastard! Tsunoda! Tsunoda! Stop! Sorry. Are you okay? You... are a loser. Running away with your camera? If you're not going to record it, go stop him. If not, report it to the viewers! You play it safe. Guys like you are no help to the world! You goddamn assholes. You're full of shit. I'll kick your ass! You stupid fuck! Mr. Mikami. How are you? Your driving test? I failed. It wasn't that easy. But... But what? I'm gonna be on TV. TV? I guess a man like me can shed light onto the viewers. Don't tell anyone. Where's the nattō? Come here... Don't take this wrong, but I think they're taking advantage of you. Advantage of me? One TV program can't change the world. What was his name, again? Tsunoda. I doubt he's seriously thinking about what's good for you. What has he made? Is being successful all that counts? He treats me well even with my scars and tattoos. But so does that lawyer who's your sponsor. You're getting welfare benefits. There's no need to rush. You ain't living off people's charity. Yeah, I do get welfare benefits. But I'm trying to get by without it. That's why I'm talking to you. Your case worker? I'm skimping on food to take driving lessons. Get off my back! There must be financial aid for training and lessons. Get healthy and find a legitimate job. I never said I wanted a legitimate job. I'm just laying low for now. One day, I'll wow the world. You're not serious, are you? Give me cash, and I'll be a pawn for the yakuza right this second. Even kill someone? For how much? 50 million. No... 30 million. They don't pay that much, do they? Get realistic. Live an honest life. It's easy for you to say. You have nothing to worry about. - No... - Shut up! We're not here to help the rich enjoy their stupid-ass peaceful lives! Today... you're in a bad mood. Let's get together and talk again. Forget it. I hate hypocrites. We're finished. "GUIDELINE" "Financial aid for training necessary for employment." "For practical skills, high school education, etc." "Subsidy in cash." It says here "subsidy in cash". Is it true? Don't get ahead of yourself. You won't pass the driving test in your condition now. That's why I'm asking about this Public Assistance Act... Ouch! Ask your case worker. That's what he's for. It's my grandchild's birthday. Can you come back another day? Sorry. Are you finished? This office won't approve 300,000 yen for driving lessons. There are less expensive ways to acquire a skill. You said you'll help me. I said I'll do what I can. The job placement center might... Mr. Iguchi, you have a call. I'll call back! - Look here. - Yes? If you're not satisfied with the welfare office's decision, you can appeal to the governor. Listen to me carefully. I haven't discussed your case with my boss yet. Please don't start complaining and put me on the spot. I'm not trying to. - Mr. Iguchi! - Yes! Stop being selfish and impatient. - Which line? - One. Thanks. You can't get an advance when the project is pending approval. That being said... it might never happen. Don't go back on your word. "THE ANATOMY OF VIOLENCE" "NEGLECT AND A CHILD'S BRAIN" - You talked me into this. - I know, but putting you on TV is too risky. We can't look for your mother, either. What happened? Did that broad reject you? Of course she did. She missed a live murder scene because of me. Murder? After we had dinner that night. I hope they're not dead. You're over-reacting. Am I? You never think about the consequences. You haven't learned your lesson. What do you mean? You still beat people up to get what you want. Not true. I'm not going back to jail. Really? I've never seen you look so alive. Why do you resort to violence? Running away is also a solution. For people only interested in their personal gain. Would an honorable man ignore an innocent citizen getting lynched? Say what you want. If you don't change, you'll never survive in society. I'd rather die than be a gutless twit like you! Playing nice only when it suits you! - Fuck you! - Tell me something. Mr. Mikami, tell me. Why are you like this? Huh?! Mommy! Is it because of your childhood? Mommy! What? Abused children often grow up to be adults who can't control their anger. But a child keeps loving his mom, no matter how she treated him. You make excuses for your mom, and say she didn't abandon you. Is that what you think? Your mom obviously... Thank goodness I found you. Yes? Is this Akimasa Shimoinaba? Who's this? Masao Mikami. You mean, Masao the Brawler? Aki? Yeah, it's me! Your brother! - Hey! - Hey! Congrats on your release. Long sentence, eh? Good to hear from you. Where you at? I'll send someone to get you. I'm in Tokyo. Catch a train or plane and get your ass over here. You'll be in good hands. Uncle Mikami. Are you hungry? I ate a bento on the plane. The boss isn't home yet. Why don't you freshen up first? Are you okay? It's my blood pressure. I need to cool down. - No hard exercise? - No. I'm afraid not. I'll take care of you. Like a nurse. You'll be safe and happy. Deep breath. You must be tired. That's enough. There's still time. We can chat. Mister... where are you from? Tokyo. But I've been around. I'm from Miyagi. - Been there? - Yeah. The winters are awfully cold. Yeah. The big earthquake. Were you already doing this job? Not yet. I started in Tokyo. That was 7 years ago. You still have a beautiful body. No kids, I bet. I don't know whether to feel flattered or not. You have a kid? A boy. We'll be back together in 6 months. This time, I won't let him go. You're a mom. Do you wanna play doctor now? No... I can't anymore. You're sweet. The number you have called is currently not in service. A clean hit to left field at the top of the 9th with 2 outs! Kokura High is ready to even out the score. Welcome back. Great to see you again. I was so happy you called. Please eat. I appreciate this. For welcoming a stray dog like me. Don't be stupid. We're brothers. Absolutely. Let's go get laid. In Kyoto, we had the same girls. Takahashi! Where are you?! Forget it. I enjoyed myself yesterday. Yes, boss. "SHIMOINABA CONSTRUCTION COMPANY" - You. - Yes? Can you drive that? Yes. Aki, I have a favor. Can I drive that truck later? Why? I'm on my way. Sit tight. Masao, I have to go. She'll get you anything you need. - Hey! - Yes! Now. Let me go with you. I can help. No. Stay here and relax. Boss. - Here we go. - Be careful. Let's go! Take care. Sister. Where is he going in his condition? He's lighter now, isn't he? After losing a leg to diabetes. This is just healthy spring water. He didn't want you to pity him. Sei, you can go now! To tell you the truth... one of our young guys stole money from us. He even called the police... on our guys that went after him. I don't blame him. The yakuza is a failing business. The banks reject you. Your kids can't go to school. People are leaving this way of life. Thanks! Don't go gambling now! Yes, ma'am. Deep down inside... maybe everybody wants out of this business. But... it's hard to fit into society. You're treated like an outcast, and before you know it... you go back to your old ways. Are you... coming back? I heard you're running out of medication. Are you holding up? Yeah. Except my body feels a bit heavy. Do you want a little pick-me-up? I'm just kidding. We stopped dealing meth. These days, I only get off on hypertension drugs. Mr. Mikami? Where are you? None of your business. Back with your old friends? You shouldn't be. Does the lawyer know? Fuck off! Only if you snitch on me, pinhead. Your accent is heavier now. You're in Kyushu? Don't hang up! It's about your mom! I heard from the orphanage. They're looking through their files. Stop. Don't go. Where's Aki?! He's home. No! We'll face our fate. But you still have this chance. You have to be patient out here. Patient with few rewards. But at least... you can live under the open sky. Mr. Mikami. Don't ruin this chance. Your camera? Camera? No more camera. I always walked my mom to this bridge. I stood here until I couldn't see her white apron. "AKATSUKI CHILDREN'S HOME" What will you say to your mom if we find her? What will I say? I'll ask her about my birth. What my delivery was like. Did you ask your mom? I can't remember. Maybe. Maybe not. Ask her. It's something only your mom would know. Director. Yes? Come on in. The government had the papers from those days. But they were disposed and burned 10 years ago. The priests at the temple have also passed away. The records are gone. But Ms. Tamura here used to volunteer at this facility back in the day. Do you remember her? No... I'm sorry. How about you? I'm sorry. I only came here from time to time to cook the meals. Did a woman in a white apron come for her son? After he'd run away at the time. It was... sometime after 1974. A geisha in Hakata. I don't know. What do you remember? Anything about the children. Let's see... I used to play the organ. At the events, the children used to sing the school song. They'd ask me to come, and we'd sing together. Under the blue sky of Tsukushi The scent of plum flowers on the hill With a bright future ahead of us Ah, our school Meigetsu-en Our home Good! Go, Kazuki! - Shoot! - Block it! Osuke! Osuke! Yes! Damn it! Osuke! Well done! Good job! Yes! Nice shot. That was great. You okay? Why are you crying? Shall I wash your back? Yeah. Mr. Mikami. I'll write about you. About how you were born. How you lived. Your footprint in this world. So... Don't go back to your old ways. Please. Okay? I'll rinse the soap. Hello. I went to see an old friend who got sick. I'm sorry. I couldn't convince my boss about your driving lessons. No problem, sir. It was a lot to ask for. Mr. Mikami. Can we discuss another idea? Your work history. Work history... I worked for the families since my teens... You're used to strict rules and doing simple tasks. Jobs that require self-discipline. Yes. Let's find an employer that will take you as you are. There are things you can do without a certification. Then make it taut. It makes the rest easier. Make a corner and tuck it in. Like this? Yes. You're good at this. I'm surprised. Same as a meth high! Where were you? Out of town? I found a job. As a driver? A trainee at a nursing home. Just part-time, but... That's great. I'm so happy for you. One step at a time. You can still go to driving school. Yeah. "CLOSED" Sorry. For the down payment on your loan. I'm sorry I got your hopes up about a job. Once you get your license, you can drive the elderly. I'm not giving it to you. Stay with your job and pay me back. I will. Just be sure to take care of your health. - Of course. - But... the banks won't approve a loan for welfare recipients. I'll lend you the rest of the money. But settle the full payment to the driving school. With no money to spare, you can stay out of trouble. Come get it tomorrow. Thank you, sir. Really. You're welcome. "CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW JOB" Look at the stars in the night sky Just like us The nameless stars They're wishing for a small, yet precious happiness Thank you for your attention. Congratulations, Mikami. - Thank you. - Congratulations. Thank you. This isn't the goal. It's only the beginning. You're a kind man. I think it's perfect for you. But it's not an easy job. Very stressful. Right? Being hot-tempered might work for the yakuza, but not in the real world. How should I put it? He's true to his principles. He doesn't compromise. In prison, there are people to stop you. But out here, nobody gives a damn, and before you know it, you're ostracized. That's right. We go along with what life presents to us. Don't let people annoy you. Don't listen. Let it slide. Let it slide. - Deep breath. - Deep breath. Don't get involved unless it's absolutely necessary or you can't defend yourself. We're not strong enough to fight every battle. Running away doesn't mean defeat. Sometimes it's the brave thing to do. Running away could lead you to new opportunities. - Mr. Mikami. - Understood. I understand now. You have to look out for yourself. Before you lose your temper, think about us. - Okay? - Yes. I won't do anything to let you down. I promise to be patient. - Let's eat. - Thank you. Eat. Yes. Mikami, come here. What is it? - Just come. - What's going on? Go downstairs. Ready? Beautiful. - Be careful. - Yes. There you go. You're doing good. He can even wave at us. - Look at him. - Great. Be careful. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Yes? Did I wake you? It's Tsunoda. Is it okay if I hang on to the inmate files? Don't tell me... You're still hanging out with that ex-con? He got a job. As an assistant at a nursing home for 990 yen an hour. Oh, yeah? Wow. No crime since then? Not any more. He'll be fine. And you? Will you be fine? What is there to write about an ordinary guy? He's going to be an ordinary guy. But I'll write anyway. I can write about him. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Put your thumb in here and push. The roots are on the outside. Pluck the ones here. - I see. - Wait. Oh... look. What is it? Larva. - Cute. - Yeah. You have snot. Sniff. There you go. Yes. Perfect. Straight, even stitches. - Look. - You're right. Amazing. I'm impressed. He should teach us. Hello. - Hi. - How are you? Hattori, what's up with Abe? Huh? The typhoon is coming, but he's still outside. Let him stay there. He's useless. You see... Hattori was paged when he was bathing Mr. Takahashi. He asked Abe to watch him, but he just sat there and played a game. And Mr. Takahashi? Strapped in the lift and neglected. He almost drowned in the bathtub. I hit Abe with his cellphone. I'm seriously scared to have him around. He should be fired. He has a mild disability. I'm sure you can tell. He did time in prison. We have a lot of ex-cons and people with low IQ. The government pays us to hire them. No morals. Slow learners. A burden on the staff. What was he arrested for? Stealing a motorcycle. He rides motorcycles? I heard he was a yakuza. No way. What can he possibly do? Simple chores for a retard. Like a pawn? Why does he always wear gloves? To hide a missing pinky? The yakuza's ritual finger cutting? Him? No way. "It doesn't hurt." "It doesn't hurt." You're nasty. Stop it. I do a good impression of him. Don't you think, Mr. Mikami? Absolutely. See? Mr. Mikami approves. He does not. Oh... Mr. Aoyama? Mr. Aoyama, is everything okay? - Are you lost? - Your room is that way. Did he change rooms recently? Last month. But he's been lost twice already. Does his family come to visit? I think so. Mr. Mikami. Want some cosmos flowers? I clipped them before the storm hits. Yes? It's Kumiko. Do you know who? Of course. What a surprise. Did your daughter tell you? A bright young lady. She takes after you. Did you find a job? Yeah. I just started. No trouble with your co-workers? No. That's all behind me. Don't worry. The world must be a difficult place for a man like you. Yeah. But... I have to keep on living. I still have your old photos. Let's go on a date. With a married woman? I'll bring my daughter. Why don't you buy us lunch? Only if you'll bring that pretty girl of yours. I thought so. It's raining. The storm is coming. I'm starting to feel giddy. You haven't changed. Masao Mikami's prison term ended on February 19, 2017. He was released the next day, after serving his 13-year sentence. After serving their sentences, convicts are completely free. But around half of them... are sent back to prison for another offense within 5 years. Since his time in juvenile detention, Mikami had 10 convictions, and served 6 of them. He has spent 28 years of life behind bars. His inmate files at Asahikawa Prison are over a meter tall when stacked up. He vowed to stay out of prison... and to go straight once and for all. Mr. Mikami? Stay outside. He's getting sent to autopsy. You can't go... I'm fine... I'm fine... Mr. Mikami! Mr. Mikami! Why?! Mr. Mikami! Mr. Mikami! Let's go outside. Pull yourself together. What will I do? What will I do? Mr. Mikami... Mr. Mikami...
