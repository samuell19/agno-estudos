Look, look Karana! It is a fine crab. I will have him for my supper. If Father does not want it for his supper. If he does not want it, I will share it with you. Put it in. Karana! Another abalone. Ramo, you know it is impossible to make a starfish let go of an abalone. I will do it someday, you will see. Well, not today. Come on now. How long will it take for that starfish to get that abalone? Three, four suns. They are both very stubborn, but the starfish will win. Why? Because it is stronger. A whale, a whale, I've killed the whale! Our father speared this whale. Ramo, you know he told us it was washed ashore by the sea. Come along now, we must dig for roots. Ramo. Today the sea is smooth, like a flat stone. The sea is not a stone. It is water, and no waves. It is a blue stone with a white cloud sitting on it. Clouds do not sit on stones. This one does. Seagulls sit there, and dolphins, and the cormorants, and whales too, but not clouds. Maybe it is a whale. I remember Father saying some canoes move by the wind. That is what it must be, a giant canoe. With red wings. Run and tell Father it is coming, a giant canoe. I want to stay and watch! Do as you're told. The Aleuts again. We will prepare to meet them. Ramo, I told you to tell Father. I did. What did he say? It is a ship that brings Aleuts. What are Aleuts? I do not know. He has hair on his face, and his skin is white. What did he say? I come in peace. I am the captain of these men. I am Chowig, chief of Ghalas-at. Forgive the manners of my dog. He's old, and he is a cur. Among men, there are also curs. Ah, you remember another hunt, 10 years ago. The captain who led it was a foolish man. He cheated you and your people. We have not forgotten. I ask only your permission to hunt sea otters, and to camp on your island. And we will share with you the value of our catch. How will you share it? You will be paid with these. And also with iron spearheads. Strings of bead and spearheads, one of each for every otter skin we take. We will count them together. You have no metal tools or weapons. These spearheads will make life much easier for you and your people. And I give you my promise, Chief Chowig. None of my men will be permitted near your village. What is Father saying? Quiet, I cannot hear. We also want iron knives. You ask too much, Chief Chowig. One iron knife for each man of my tribe, it is fair. - It is fair. - Shh. You bargain well for your people, Chief Chowig. All right, I agree. As chief of Ghalas-at, I have given the hunters permission to camp on our island and take otter from the seas that wash our shores. Perhaps because of what happened when the Aleuts were here before, some of you feel this is not a wise decision. But that was many years ago, and these are not the same men. Their leader has promised to keep his men away from our village. We shall watch, and we shall count the skins. We shall not be cheated, but let us also try to respect the rights of each other. And let us hope we may learn to trust each other. Ramo. Every day, they hunt the otter. It is terrible to kill so many. Why do they kill so many? They use the furs for trading. Soon there will not be any left. Do not worry, child. The otters are smart. Most of them have gone away to hide. They will return when the hunters leave. We will rest a little. I do not like the Aleuts. They are very cruel. Maybe they worship Tumaiyowit. Tell us about Tumaiyowit and Mukat. You've heard the story many times. Please, Father? In the beginning of the world, Tumaiyowit and Mukat ruled everything. All life, even the grasses and the trees. Then they began to quarrel, you remember why? Because Tumaiyowit wished everything to die, and Mukat wished everything to live. After a very great dispute, Tumaiyowit went down to another world, and took many things with him, even the tall trees that used to grow on our island. He was very evil. And though Mukat was very good, with all his great power, he could not prevent the evil Tumaiyowit left in the world. So we have sharks in the sea that kill for the sake of killing. But also we have the dolphins, who are gentle, and playful, and harm nothing. I like the dolphins. So do I. It is believed Mukat is always present when one sees dolphins. That is why they are the signs of good fortune. But most things are like this. The berries of the coral bush are beautiful, but Tumaiyowit made them deadly to eat. Then Mukat used his magic, and made the juices of the wood a healer of wounds. This peeled branch can sometimes cure when all else has failed. And so it is, even with people. A mixture of both good and evil. The Aleuts too? The Aleuts too. I will still be glad when they are gone. I hope it will be soon. Here, I'll help you do it. Karana! You know it is forbidden for a female to make weapons. It is taboo. Any woman who dares break the ancient law of our tribe will be smothered by the four winds and swallowed up by the sea. I do not say this to frighten you, my child. But the taboo is sacred. I say it only because I love you, and I want to protect you. Chowig! Chief Chowig! The Aleuts! What about the Aleuts? They're at Coral Cove. They have already taken some otter skins to the ship. Chief Chowig, I was coming to see you. I do not believe that. You judge me unfairly, Chief Chowig. I have not broken my word to you. The boat is now bringing the goods we agreed on. But you have already taken many skins to your ship. You did not allow us to count them with you, as you promised. I know, and I am sorry about that. We took 420 skins. Some are on the ship, and the rest are still here. If you wish, you may return to the ship with me and count the skins for yourself. There are no spearheads or knives there. These fools did not bring the two other chests. I'll have them brought ashore at once. When I was a child, I visited a land far to the east with my father. It was a long voyage to that land, but I am going to seek help for you. If the hunters come back before I return, you are all to come here at once. Together, you will leave the island, and try to reach the land far to the east. It is a long, dangerous voyage. But it is safer to trust the sea than the Aleuts. Cover the canoes with kelp, so that none can be seen by an approaching ship. Until I return, stay out of sight. We wouldn't have to dig so many roots if the wild dogs hadn't stole many of the abalones. It's because of their new leader, the dog the Aleuts left behind. Kimki has been gone a long time. Maybe it is too far for him. Not for Kimki. He's old, but he is very strong. But what would he do if there is fog, and he could not see anything? Maybe the dolphins would lead him. Ramo, why do you say such a thing? You know it is not true. It is true. Father always said that dolphins are a sign of good fortune. Do you not trust the dolphins? I do not know, and I do not want to talk about it anymore. Kimki, it's Kimki! Kimki, Kimki! Kimki, we thought you'd never come back. Karana, Ramo. No, no, do not be afraid. Why he, he is a very good man. We are all going to his mission to live. Their ship must sail before the tide turns. We all must hurry, hurry, everyone. We must hurry. Hurry now, hurry! The ship must sail before the tide. Be quick now, hurry along, quickly. Ramo, you cannot take those. Why? Because you must help me carry the baskets of food we need for our journey. That basket of rocks. It's so heavy, you could not even lift it. They are not rocks. They are very valuable treasures of great worth. Here, take this. Come on. I wanna go in the canoe with Kimki! Ramo. Lurai, I cannot see Ramo. Do not worry, the others will look after him. Ramo, my brother! He's still on the island! He's still on the island! Please, we must go back for him. Karana, you must sit down. Ramo is in the other boat. No, no, he's still on the island! Karana! Karana, come back! Come back, or you will be left behind. Please, we must go back, please! Please. Karana, Karana! Karana, Karana! I am hungry. I hope we can find something to eat. In the morning, we will go to Lookout Rock to see if the ship is returning. I hope it never returns. I like us being here alone. Now we have the whole island to ourselves. I am the son of Chowig. I am the only man left. I am now chief of Ghalas-at. Chief Ramo. The name does not suit me. You will call me Chief Tanyosetlopai. Chief Tanyosetlopai. It's a very big name for so small a chief. It's too hard to say. You will learn, and now you must obey me. Yes, Chief Ramo. Chief um... Tanyosetlopai. Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Someday I'm gonna kill all the wild dogs. Especially the leader. But I will need a stronger spear. Will you help me make one? No. You know that is forbidden. But if I am chief, and I say it is all right? Anyway, there will not be enough time to do it before the ship returns. When will it return? Soon. But when? - Soon. - But when? Ramo, please. I do not know. Do not worry, Kimki will make them come back. You will see. Maybe. But they are not our people. And I do not trust them. Lurai told me she saw eggs on the cliff with the gull's nest. In the morning, we'll go there and gather them. It is a woman's work to gather gull eggs. I will go to Secret Cove and launch the small canoe so I can catch large fish. You will not. I will too. You may be chief of Ghalas-at, but you are going to have to grow much larger before I will let you go out alone in a canoe. Maybe after we gather the eggs, I'll help you launch the canoe, and we can paddle it together. We'll talk about it in the morning. Ramo? Ramo? Ramo, where are you? Ramo! Ramo! Ramo! Ramo! Ramo! Ramo. I will burn you to death. I will kill you as you killed my brother! I will kill you! How did the men do this? Now I will kill the Aleut dog, the one who killed Ramo. The dog whose master killed my father. Please, do not break when I need you most. How did you get in here? I built this to keep you out. It is open. Go! Go! Well, go! Go! Your eyes are like those of a fox, and as I do not trust a sly fox, I do not trust you either, dog. That would be a good name for you. I will call you Rontu. It means fox eyes. I do not want you here! Go away, and leave me alone! Go away, go away! There's only two left. All right, you like to bark at the gulls? Well, since you do not help me gather the abalone, or catch the fish, you can stay here and keep the gulls away until I get back. Now remember, we still have no fish today, and the gulls have stolen most of the abalone. Do not let them steal the rest. Rontu. Come on Rontu, get in. You'll like it. It was Lurai who taught me how to make a flute from a pelican bone. Rontu? Rontu. Rontu! Rontu? If you're going to act that way, you can catch your own fish. This is going to be your new house. You'll like living with me. It'll be just us. Do not be afraid. Soon your mother will fly away and leave you. And I'll feed you, and take care of you even better than she did. I've even decided what I'm going to name you. You will be called Lurai, in honor of my friend who used to live on this island. And you will be called Tainor. Rontu? Rontu! Rontu, please come back. All right, go with them. You stay with them. If you dare come back now, I will throw stones at you. I don't need anybody. Karana. Karana. Karana, Karana. Karana, Karana. Karana. Karana. Goodbye, Lurai. Goodbye, Tainor. Karana, Karana, Karana. Oh, Rontu. Oh Rontu, Rontu. Rontu. Rontu. Rontu. Rontu. Tutok. We must hide, she will bring the hunters. Sh, sh, stay here. I know it is cold, but we cannot build a fire here. The hunters might see it and come looking for us. You wish they would leave so we could move back to our warm house on the mesa. So do I Sh, sh, sh. Tutok? I am Karana. Karana? Rontu. Rontu is my dog. Water. You are beautiful. Flute. Do you want to play it? Flute? Oh, Rontu. How do I look, Rontu? Oh, Tutok. I am so happy. She will come back tomorrow, and then we can move back to our home. Karana, Karana. I was afraid you were not coming. I've been waiting for you all day. No, I cannot go with you. Not with the men who killed my father. Do not go away, please. Stay here with me. Please, stay with me. You, here. No. Tutok! Rontu, look. He must have gotten lost from the rest of his tribe. Do not be afraid. You'll be safe here. We'll bring you fresh fish every day, because there aren't any in the pool. Come on, Rontu. Hurry up, Rontu. Get in. Don't be so slow, get in. Come on, come here. I am going to call you Mon-a-nee. That means little boy with large eyes. I wish you could come live with us, but we have no seawater pool up there. But we will bring fresh fish to you every day, and come and visit you every day so you will not be lonely. Come here. Come on. Come on, Rontu. Our new friend Mon-a-nee will be so hungry, he'll be glad we brought him so many fish. He's gone. He's gone back to the sea. Rontu, I hope he did not think we forgot about him. But we should not feel sad that he is gone. We should be happy. He's gone back with his tribe again. Rontu? Rontu? Rontu! Rontu? Rontu! Rontu, what are you doing back there? Are you sick? Come on, Rontu. It's late, we have to go home. Please? Please get up and come home with me. I'll build a fire for you. You're just tired, that's all it is. After you get warm and, I'll cook some fish right here for you. If you want, we can stay here tonight. In the morning, you'll be all rested and that's all it is. You're just tired. If Suma were here, he'd know how to make you feel better right away. He was the shaman of our tribe, and whenever anyone was sick, he knew how to call on the magic of the good god, Mukat. He is the god who wants all people, and dogs too, to be well, and happy. Mukat? My father told me you wanted everything to live. Please, please help Rontu. Please help him now. Please. Please. The sand is already nice and warm. Come out and lie in the sun. I'll make you feel much better, Rontu. Please. Please. Come on. You always liked to bark at the gulls. All mornings and afternoons you've barked at them. Please, get up and bark at them now, for me. Get up. Get up. If you would've known him, Ramo, you would've loved him too. No, no more Killing. Karana, Karana. Karana, Karana. All right, but I want you to understand, I am not going to love you. I will feed you, and I like you now, but I am not going to love you. If you do bad things, I will punish you. If you do not like it here, you can go back to the pack where you belong. I will call you Rontu-Aru, son of Rontu. Come on, you must learn to swim. Your father loved to. He used to swim every day. Come on, I won't let anything happen to you. Here you go, that's it. Come on, that's it. Come on. That's good. There, you see how much fun it is? Soon you can learn to chase the gulls so we can fish in peace. Good dog. Good. Good dog. Come on. Come on! Oh, I do not know what to do. I do not know what to do.
