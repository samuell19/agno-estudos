People's Revolution! A united country, freedom One people, one nation BETWEEN DOG AND WOLF If they were to stab you in the stomach? Down And there... Miguel, if they threw the machete in your face? And… You can also hold it like this... It's nasty Alright, ready Grab it by the tip Toss it over there with the rest Pass me that one Ok, let it go Work on that one When you deactivate a landmine the first thing you need is courage Because it's better that you die than your troops So what happens? When you start you have to poke it with the tip of your cane Forward You can't push it too hard Because if it's a landmine, it goes off You have to poke it and push Touch is very important for detection If there is a rock, there is a mine And you go back on your own footsteps The first duty of a revolutionary is to defend the homeland We must keep this struggle going Continue the work of the revolution Some men fight one day and they are good Some fight for twenty days and they are better But some of us fight our whole life and we are indispensable Glass may crack but men die on their feet One, two, three Vietnams One hundred years of struggle One Revolution Fatherland or Death! We will win! They all leave No, not all of them leave When a woman leaves you it means she doesn't love you That's logical I have never cried in front of a woman You cried so hard that rivers of tears flowed down from the mountains I didn't cry Miguel, how are your legs? Ready to continue That's the plan Esteban, don't let it burn! Miguel, you can also grab him by the neck He is teaching you one technique, but you try to do it your way Let him go Twist him Quickly Pin him down Miguel Grab his leg and twist it Come on Miguel, grab his feet Grab his leg, twist it There you go There you go You see? His foot, Miguel Try to turn it around Don't squeeze me that way, man This is only a training, fuck Come on Absolutely not No, no, don't do it anymore Never let yourself be dominated He is teaching you, but don't let yourself be dominated Ok, enough, let's try a different one Come on, let's train. Come on! We shouldn't get angry about this This is just an exercise, none of us should get angry Miguel can't be so docile with you Because you are using too much force Come on, let's try a different one That doesn't involve grappling Let's try… The eyes, for example No, that one is worse There, there... It was an accident Come on I put my foot down the wrong way Look You have to blind your enemy because this is your only chance We'll put it in a splint for you Or we're gonna cut your leg off Won't be the cure worse than the disease? Come on! You haven't brushed your teeth yet I'm going to wash them Santana, this guy needs more than ten blades to shave his legs He shaves his legs, men She's pretty She looks like a frog Since she is pretty, she must stay pretty Buy a razor blade to shave your whole body I'll buy one for the mules What he needs is to be shaved with sand Sand is what he needs He looks like a stuffed pig Fuck you, both My medals got wet, everything got wet! I'm leaving this platoon, man Take that! Water snake! Take that! You shouldn't have done that Whats that? I earned them with great sacrifice, fuck you Looks like a little bonbon Oh! So beautiful! This is finished Hey, wash your clothes, they stink You, motherfucker When we came into the base the huts were engulfed in flames I heard... over the radio, a baby crying and crying... I checked the where the sound was coming from And I headed there… When I entered the hut... I saw the baby lying in his crib But I decided... Suddenly, a chill ran up my spine And I decided not to pick up the baby Minutes later, other comrades came up A comrade entered into the hut Because he also heard the baby screaming As he picked up the baby... we felt the blast And it was the baby There was an invisible wire... tied to a Claymore mine hidden somewhere in the hut They all were blown to pieces We went back... all of us to pick up what was left... of our comrade, who... tears running down our faces Because if he would have made the same decision I had... he wouldn't have died But he followed his conscience, he had to save the child And it was a mistake Look at that, who is over there? You call yourselves guerrilla fighters... but I never saw you fighting when I was part of the revolution You won't get anything in return from it, in my opinion I don't see any improvement Well... I have been doing this for a long time now And I want to tell you... I still haven't run my course And I am still a guerrilla I won't change your mind, everyone has different principles You have your own ideas, and I have mine But no one can take away my ideas The truth is... either way you look at it... what we did is done, we didn't ask for anything in return But we must keep going We should share what we have... and continue onward, my friend If they help us it's fine, if not it's their problem, not ours Our only duty is to continue Loose stones must be swept from dirt paths If you see me again... Do you really think... when this guerrilla war you are fighting is over... do you think that you will get something back from this “new” revolution? We only went to the Popular Republic of Angola... to bring proletarian internationalism to other countries Fighting the revolution we asked for nothing in return, we fought for an ideal That's what we stand for But I started before you and what did I get? But you got soft No I didn't Yes, you should have continued like the rest of us We took up arms and continued Are you ok? I don't know, my friend Remember... we never stopped being guerrilla fighters We must keep making guerrilla war It's just that I have been to hell and I don't want to go back there again We must keep moving forward always Where are you Bellaco? At this moment I remember many things... when you proposed I come along... all the tensions involved in the preparations One day they asked... who should be notified in case of death... and the real possibility of that fact affected us all Later we knew it was true... that in a revolution one wins or dies... if it is a real one Many comrades fell along the way to victory Today everything has a less dramatic tone... because we are more mature, but the event repeats itself I feel that I have fulfilled the part of my duty... that tied me to the Cuban revolution in its territory... and I say farewell to you... to the comrades, to your people, who now are mine as well What's wrong? Miguel, are you leaving us? Santana, let me tell you something... I'm leaving You can't go Alberto, please don't beg me, you are my brother You are my friend and my father But when I say let me go, just let me go I know why I'm doing this, let me go With everything that is still left to do? How can you leave? Yes I know dammit Don't you remember when we were in Angola? The mission must be accomplished And it was So? So I don't know if I'm coming back, will you wait for me?” So what did we do? Huh!? We looked after each other Easy Hey What You served in Africa, too? Yes Where? In Jamba, in Angola How did you return home? On the ship Leonid Sobinov What year? In 1984 I was your replacement I came back to Cuba on that same ship, but I left on a plane Yes, I left in a plane, too All those mountain ranges had landslides And your people seem tired You can't pass through there The rain has destroyed all of the paths around here It would be crazy MISSING IN ACTION. BODY NOT RECOVERED ROLANDO PEREZ ROMERO, 1982 Article 80. Tributes paid to deceased veterans represent a public showing and a high respect for the dignity the prestige and the honor of each fallen soldier Therefore, wherever the corpse or the ashes are displayed... the Cuban flag must be placed on the top of the coffin, over the grave His medals will be displayed next to the coffin the medals received in his career as a revolutionary combatant will be displayed there A floral offering to the combatants will also be laid out Before the coffin comes out... an honor guard made up of the members of this association, comrades and the relatives will be created This is all in terms of the tributes paid in the funeral of our deceased combatants Members of this association All in favor, please raise your hand Ok, it passes If anyone wants to propose or to discuss something spoken about here, please raise your hand I wanted to say that... we fought, like others did in Escambray, Playa Girón and Sierra Maestra We gave our lives in exchange for nothing It doesn't mean that I'm asking for something in return, because many of us have received some help already, I just think that... all ex-combatants should be taken into consideration, because everyone here is in need They should take care of us. We don't want things for free, just for whats fair To have some help according to our needs But I don't want anything for free I put my life at risk for this revolution, because I'm a revolutionary... and I die for this country I agree with comrade Estebita If it hurts, it hurts, and if a comrade is in need, we must find a solution We must speak out about it That is why we must always be soldiers and revolutionaries We are based on the rules and the ethical principles of the revolution Because we will never let down the revolution It's true that nowadays we have some veterans whose situation is critical Who don't live well Some of them don't even receive any allowance because of health problems They are in a critical situation Some of the veterans received help, but not all of them, since there are thousands in the whole country Friend! It is His word that gives us life, only through God we can reach Heaven. Come to the feet of Jesus Christ, we are inviting you, come! We are inviting you, Hallelujah! Praise the Lord He is the only way, come to the feet of Jesus Christ, Hallelujah. The end the times are near, Praise the Lord! The bible tells us about the wars that are coming, Hallelujah. Praise the Lord, we are inviting you, come to the feet of Jesus Christ, Praise the Lord, Hallelujah We are inviting you to the worship service, come to feet of Jesus Christ, Hallelujah! Once... I was given the order to guide a platoon Through... We had to go on a mission... so I left the base My work was to deactivate landmines, and I came across one When I found it, I saw it was a dangerous one... and I tried to deactivate it I hadn't seen my son yet; he was born when I was there My first son Seeing how dangerous it was, I told myself: I won't ever see my son I went to a very bad place Maybe a nervous breakdown, maybe... It was so bad that they sent another soldier to do my job, I couldn't do it I couldn't do it, I failed I wasn't strong enough to do it, I couldn't do it My emotions didn't let me finish I wanted to see... I knew how hard the mission was, but I also wanted to meet my first son That hurt a lot I couldn't be a man It still hurts a lot I'm sitting on the top of the world I'm standing in the deepest river I'm sitting on the top of the world I'm standing in the deepest abyss At night, at the well, you can hear a grieving soul At night, at the well, you can hear a grieving soul Begging for light for this spirit trapped in darkness So we can find the best way to leave this world Begging for light for this spirit trapped in darkness So we can find the best way to leave this world I'm sitting on the top of the world I'm standing in the deepest river I'm sitting on the top of the world I'm standing in the deepest abyss One day the pilgrims knocked at my door, asking where she lived One day the pilgrims knocked at my door, asking where she lived She is buried at Sabra Plain, where the cities that they ordered to be burned are She is buried at Sabra Plain, where the cities that they ordered to be burned are You will climb the mountain The old mountain... of white stone On the other side you will find a river of bright and transparent water The heavy rain will fall over you, it is a good sign It is a signal that you are on the right track At the end of it you will find a forest full of birds that sing like Sirens Do not let yourself be fooled by this, go to the next mountain When you reach the second one, you will be convinced that this is the place... and you will not want to come down or return ever again Let's go Brother, love your brother FOR MY FATHER Don't look at the color of his skin Look he is just an Angolan Angolan, love your brother Comrade The word of order is unity Comrade The word of order is unity Because with the good people of Angola united Our independence will come Because with the good people of Angola united Colonialism won't last Brother, love your brother Don't look at the color of his skin Look he is just an Angolan Angolan, love your brother Comrade The word of order is unity Comrade The word of order is unity Because with the good people of Angola united Our independence will come Because with the good people of Angola united Colonialism won't last
