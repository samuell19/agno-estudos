We have an interesting tradition at our house. On Mother's Day, I love to tell my wife, "Go out, do something for yourself." "Do something fun, relax." "Just take a rest from all of your hard work." We have six kids. And every year she does the same thing. Her favorite thing to do on Mother's Day, no kidding, she goes out and she buys gifts for the kids. Not for herself but for the kids. And she says, "I love being a mom." "It's my favorite thing to do, and so I wanna buy presents "for the ones who made me a mom." And every year she gets something for each one and it's always something special that kind of corresponds with something that happened that year. Something that they learned or something that really represents something about them specifically. Well, one Mother's Day Chelsea says to me, "I wanna get the kids smartphones." "All of 'em." I mean they had some flip phones but let's get 'em smartphones. And so much of their sports and their school is now revolving around technology and even social media with the teachers. And I said, "Okay, let's do it. Let's get the kids smartphones." I mean, what could be simpler and what could possibly go wrong?" ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ It was like Christmas at our house, on Mother's Day, and I was getting the dad of the year award. I thought it would be simple at the beginning. My kids would use it to text, to make phone calls, but right out of the gates, they wanted all these apps. They want Twitter and Snapchat and Instagram and they want music and movies and they want games and spend all this time looking at their phone. And then I saw a story on the news, a crazy story of what happened to man named Tim Woda and his son through social media. I wanted to meet him, so I went to his house and I asked him if he would tell me the details in person. ♪♪♪ Tim, how many kids do you have? -I've got three kids, 13 to 23. -Okay, so you and your wife are raising three kids and then what happened? Your son was 14? -It was typical Saturday morning, we get a phone bill and my wife and I are going through the phone bill and it's huge. It's like this massive bill, because this is before there's like unlimited texting and calling and so forth. -Right, right. -So first that runs through our mind is, "Wow, our kid is in so much trouble." You know, he just blew up this bill. So we get him in, we call him over to the table, we're going through this bill and asking him a lot of questions. And he doesn't really have very good answers, which isn't hugely surprising for a 14 year old, but he was somewhat evasive about who these people were. And I started to look closer at the bill, I notice that these are numbers that are not from our area and I'm like, "Who does my 14 year old talk to or text?" Because it was all text messages. -Out of state? -Yeah out of state, different exchanges and things like that. So over the course of a few days, I'm asking him like more and more questions about it. I say, "Where did you meet this person?" Because I had nailed down a handful of the texts that seemed like they were the ones he was getting the most inbound text messages from. And I said, "Where'd you meet this person?" He said, "I met this person on Facebook." I said, "Well, that's not possible, because you don't have a Facebook account." [laughs] Then all of a sudden, okay, he had a Facebook account I didn't know about. I immediately asked him for credentials and he gave me an email address to login. And I said, "I didn't know about this email address." Then I kind of connected the dots, that email address led me down to an instant messenger account. Then there was all these people that he was talking to on instant messenger. He had this whole digital life that I had had no idea it even existed. In the process of that, one of the things that jumped out at me was that there was a couple of contacts and in particular this person, who I didn't connect the dots that it was the same person on the text messages, but it was a grown adult man who was messaging my son. So as I started to talk to my son more about this, he never denied anything, but he only answered questions I asked, so it was a little challenging. And really when it came down to it, what we discovered was that there was this grown man, who was basically soliciting my child. He was trying to get him to meet offline. He was soliciting my son for pictures. My son was like, "Go away, you're creeping me out." "You're strange." And he basically said, "Listen, I know who you are, "I know where you live, I know where you go to school." I know every interest you have." You've put it all online." I'm just gonna come and get you, then." -Oh, wow... So what happened? -So, I went to the police. So I went down to the county police and I showed them all these messages and what was going on. And they said, "Listen, this stuff is happening so much." All day, every day parents are coming in here with these kind of stories." So I took it to the FBI. I actually contacted the FBI in my state. They took the computers, they took... I mean, they took it serious. They came back to me and said, "You're right." "This is definitely a child predator who's targeting your son. The bad news is we think this person's probably in your state, doesn't cross state lines. It's not our jurisdiction." So I really didn't have any legal paths to take. -Yeah. -But I did have a phone number. I have the same name as my son. So I called the guy. So when he sees my son's phone number on his caller ID. -He thinks it's your son. -He thinks it's my son. He's psyched. He answers the phone and there's this enthusiasm in his voice. -Like I've been waiting for your call. -Yeah, it's really hard to describe how... You know, I just wanted to reach through the phone as you might imagine at this point. And I basically said, "Listen, you need to seriously hope that the police find you before I figure out who you are." You need to stay away from my son." Just trying to intimidate him, basically. And he just hung up the phone without saying anything. [dial tone buzzes] Are you kidding me? Are you serious? I didn't, I did not intend to give my children a device that predators could use to help stalk them. I mean, I knew that my phone was not just a phone and I was giving my kids in truth a computer. It's a super computer. I mean, actually there's more computing power in this little device than they used to put a man on the moon. I mean, it was so different when we were kids, right? If we wanted to go see a movie, I'd go to Blockbuster, we'd rent a movie. And "be kind, rewind," we'd give it right back to them. If we wanted an album, I'd go down to the music store. But now, I've got every song, every movie. I have access to the Library of Congress. Go anywhere I want, and my kids can see anything that they want to see with the touch of a button. I decided I needed to get to the bottom of understanding how technology and my kids were interacting, particularly in the area of social media. And so, somebody gave me this great book, it's called "Screens and Teens" by Dr. Kathy Koch. And she's the go-to person on this subject. I went to her office, we sat down and talked and she blew my mind with five lies our children are believing because of social media and technology. Kathy, I am so excited to be talking with you. Once I read your book, I realized that my big concern about social media and my kids is not just a safety thing, which is real, but you bring up all these other things. One of the things that happened was really good parents saying to me, "What's wrong with my kids?" Why am I doing the very best that I know how to do? It worked for my oldest kid, it's not working for my younger kid. Why are they argumentative? Why are they complaining? Why is nothing ever good enough?" -Yeah. -"Why are they are maybe even distancing themselves from God?" -When they're more blessed and have more to be thankful for than anybody. -Absolutely, absolutely. So that's where I began to look and go, okay, what's the common denominator here? And it was technology. It was the phone, the devices, the iPads, the laptops even the old fashioned desktop computer changed us, the World Wide Web and all that. So five lies. Number one, "I am the center of my own universe." -Bingo. -Right. How many kids do you meet that say that - exactly. I am the center of, the world revolves around me. -Let's see, when I was kid and the phone rang, I had to answer it because I didn't know who was there. -Right? -Right. Now when my phone rings or your phone rings... -I look at it, see who it is and then... -And you're like I don't wanna talk to this person, so you act as if they don't live. You think you're in control of the world. You can post on social media, watch for the "like" factor. And know so many young adults who, they'll stare at the device. -Waiting for the likes. -Yeah, and then when it doesn't happen, they post it again, thinking that all my friends must have been away from their devices, so I'm gonna post it again. -Even ads that pop up on my phone are all geared toward me. -So how's that make you feel, when you search somewhere and then you see an ad within minutes? Do you like that or does it make you nervous? -No, I don't like that. It makes me feel spied upon. -Exactly, me too. But young people, they think that's so cool. -They're paying attention to me." -Exactly. So they feel more valuable. -So they think that they're at the center of the universe, that's sort of something that's being taught to them over and over and over. And what's the second lie? -Second lie is, "I have to be happy all the time." Or I deserve to be happy all the time. The happiness lie, I call it. Everything's new. Everything's now. This entitlement thing, right? They wait in line at midnight when the store's gonna open with the new device or the new game or the new movie, like they're gonna run out, that they have to have it right now. Nothing ever breaks, right? When I was a kid, if something broke you had to save money to buy a new one. Today if something breaks, daddy buys you a new one. And it's actually cheaper and easier to get a new one than it is to get the old one repaired. And so they don't really think anything breaks, they don't think that anything's ever really permanently damaged. Lie number three, "I must have choice." Think about everything you use has a drop down menu. Your cell phone, your camera, Facebook, Snapchat. If I go and I wanna watch something on TV, or Netflix, or whatever, all drop down menus. I know the choices of privilege. When I'm offered chicken or steak, it's a privilege. These kids think it's an expectation. And if they go to grandma's house and they only have steak, it's like, "What? She didn't ask me what I want!" -And our reaction is, "You're so ungrateful." -Exactly. -Just take a minute to say thank you. And you're saying they're actually being programmed to say "Wait, where are my choices? Where's my drop down menu for dinner at grandma's house?" -Right. It's so sad that I think we've lost the ability to say no. -And what's the fourth lie? -"I am my own authority." On social media, there's thousands of experts, right? So I might as well be one too. But when I was a child, if I had a question, I left my bedroom and I found my mom and my dad. Now kids can ask Siri on their phone a question. But it's making kids think that everybody has an opinion and everybody might be right, including me. Now there's other reasons that that lie is prevalent in our culture today too. There's authority failures in our government, schools, media, and so kids aren't exposed in my opinion to a lot of good authority role models. Unfortunately, a lot of parents are saying, "Just do whatever you want." So they're not authorities either. Moms and dads want their kids to be happy because they wanna be happy themselves. Oh my goodness, it's a dangerous cycle, if you're following me. -Right, so I want my kids to be happy so I give them what they want and if they want options, I give that to them. -Right. -And have trouble saying no. -So that actually weakens my authority. So they don't come to me. And that's why so many parents are grieving, "Why don't they come to me when they need help?" -That's right. -Yeah. The fifth lie, "Information is all that matters, so I don't need teachers." We were raised to respect teachers whether that be school teachers, Sunday school teachers, Girl Scout leaders, if you will. So these kids believe that they're their own authority, so for that reason, they really don't need to be teachable. Which is one of the reasons that they're not studying and parents are probably really struggling with them to be academically engaged. And then information's all that matters. Why do they believe that? Because it's everywhere. There's email blasts and there's apps for data. And we're inundated with information. -What they really need is wisdom. -Exactly. -They need a parent, or a teacher, or a pastor or somebody who has wisdom to know what to do with the information. -Exactly. So the very thing that they think will satisfy them never will. So they'll be this gerbil in the cage. "I need more information, I need more data, I need more information." They're never going to be satisfied because they were created for more than information. -How did we get to this place where they're believing all of that? -We've allowed technology to raise our kids. Many parents have admitted to me that they've handed their kids a device when their kids are complaining. They've handed their kids their old phone to soothe them. And rather than teaching the ABC's to a four year old, we're giving them an app on a device to teach them. Rather than watching shows with our kids and discussing the plot development and whether or not there was a kid in that show that you'd wanna befriend, we're letting the kids in their own room do their own thing because we're busy and we're tired and we're doing our own thing. So to be very honest with you, part of the dilemma that we have going on, is the mentally absent parent. And I have such empathy. They're busy, they're overwhelmed, they're scared, they're confused, I get that. And yet it's not helping them by handing over the parenting to the device. They need to parent their kids. Everything Dr. Kathy was saying was making so much sense to me. I could see each of those things playing out in the lives of children with phones all around me. And it reminded me of another conversation that I had around a campfire with one of my good friends Dr. Ian Armstrong. Ian happens to be a brain surgeon, for real. He's a neuroscientist and he was explaining how the development of the teenage brain combines with information and stimulus and how kids process that during the teenage years actually has a lot to do with determining what kind of adults they become later in life. So I went to his office and had him explain the whole thing to me. So the teenage brain is in a stage of rapid development. There's an area of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, or frontal lobes. It is basically the air traffic control, if you will, for the brain. Understanding of consequences, impulse control and emotion control, it's the prefrontal cortex. And it really doesn't develop until the mid-20's. At the other end of the teenage years, in puberty, the limbic system is developed. That is being bombarded with the hormones of puberty at 12 and 13. And the frontal lobes aren't there to control it. So you see young men, young women, doing things that don't seem particularly logical. They don't understand the consequences. The teenage brain has that, as we described, seeking behavior and social media just lends itself to that. There is constant re-enforcement, constant newness, there's constant pings, tings, bells, friends, new friends, someone "liked" this. So they're getting constant stimulus and you might call it overstimulation. 50% kids when asked say that they feel they're addicted to their social media. They check their phone at least every five minutes. Studies have shown that when you take that phone away, it actually creates anxiety. On the internet, in social media, it's a free-for-all. You can look at pornography, you can exchange pictures, you can make whatever comments you want in the quiet darkness of your bedroom, doing things socially and so forth that you may not do face to face. There are so many choices and what a young person really needs to make those choices, they don't have. They don't have maturity. Check one, check two. I'm Mancini Morales from Gaineswood, Georgia and I'm 20 years old. I'm Christian, 21 years old and I reside here in Ventura, California. I took a test in elementary school that told me I wasn't gonna be able to graduate high school, I wasn't gonna be able to read. A lot of just negative stuff that was on my life. I went through a little bit of bullying. They called me like, "fatty." And then they'd just be like, "Oh, you're just so dumb." But I would get that, like, I know that "dumb" isn't like, big, but I would just get it so consistently, it was just like all the time. "You're dumb, you're stupid." Like, "What are you gonna do in the future?" Just all that. -I was probably about nine. My cousin came over, spent the night. And it was my brother, my brother and my cousin in our room. And I walked in and it was just, it was on our screen. And they let me sit down and I think from that time it just struck, it sparked something. Even after that, I remember walking in on my dad a couple of times, you know, watching it. And kind of figured, I mean, I knew it wasn't right, but it kind of felt normal. After a couple of months or a couple of years, just stealing a video and whenever I had time to myself I'd just put it on. I was kind of numb to it. -So my friend showed me Facebook and I was like, "Heck yes, I'm gonna add all my friends. "It's gonna be so much fun. We're just gonna be talking 24/7." When I ever saw the friend request, I would get so happy. It'd be like, "Ah, somebody wants to be my friend!" And I would just accept them even if I didn't know who they were. Just because I just wanted to be known as Mancini who has a lot of friends. And I would always get comments just about how ugly I looked in a picture. And then I would delete the picture just because of the rude comment, because I didn't want my mom seeing, just to see what I was going through. -When I found out about Instagram, or even Facebook, with Facebook, different porn companies have their personal pages up there to kind of just give the, to advertise their page. I had it at my palm at 15,16. Yeah, if you're kid with a smartphone you could look up anything you want. It's there. -One of the things that happens when you look at pornography and the brain responds with dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter that is linked to reward and pleasure, the more that you do it, it takes more and more stimulation to get a similar response in the brain. But to get that same dopaminergic response, that same sort of high, if you will, that they got early on, they've had to move along just like in drugs. You start with a certain dose of cocaine and you have to move up, your body gets habituated. So pornography does the same thing. From a neurophysiological standpoint, it's just not a bad habit, it's not harmless. It does have a neurochemical and neurophysiological basis. -I had a sexual relationship with my girlfriend and I think whenever I wasn't with my girlfriend, I was with my computer screen or my iPhone, my iPhone screen, actually. I wasn't happy at all, I was always angry. I think that was probably the angriest I was, ever. And some people that I didn't even know who they were, were like telling me just, "your profile's dumb." And just all that and I'd just be like, "Dang, I'm just getting from people I don't even know now. Like, what the heck?" The words they start giving you is the words you believe. You take a test and you fail and you're like, "Wow, maybe I am really dumb. Maybe I really can't do anything in life. Like, why, why live?" -It's very easy for people involved in social media, young people, that that becomes their life. Their social media world. But that world can be quickly upended. An insult, a rebuke, a lot of dislikes. Sort of dropping from social media circles can have a huge effect. More of an effect if that young person is not still connected to the family. -And there's times where, um... I had a gun at my head. It was just being alone and feeling, like knowing I had friends, yeah, but were they really my friends? Were they really there for me? My family, they're wanting me to achieve greatness. But would they be better without me? The more I learned, the more I wanted to take the phones away from the kids. I mean, potentially putting my children in physical harm and giving them a portal that would open them up to a dark world that could move them to addictive behavior, suicide, depression and anxiety, peer pressure, off the charts. All at a time when my children's brain is developing into the person that they're gonna become? I just wanted to get rid of the phones. But I also knew that that was not the solution. That's a losing battle. You can't run from technology and nor should we. I think technology's a good thing, it's not a bad thing. It's a tool and it can be used for good or it could be used for evil. In fact, I use technology and social media, it greatly helps many of the projects that I work on. The real battle is not parents against Facebook. [glass smashes] The true nature of the battle is the battle of the heart. There's a verse in the Bible that has become a verse for my life. It's Proverbs 4:23. It says, "Above all else, above all else, guard your heart, because everything you do flows from it." Everything my kids do, everything they think, every word that comes out of their mouth, every choice they make, flows from their heart. And so that is the battleground as a parent, that I need to get on with both feet, the battle of their heart. So I went to speak with one of my friends, Pastor Ken Graves, at one of my favorite churches in Los Angeles, California, the Church of the Angels and we just talked about the battle between good and evil. -Come in, let's talk it over. ♪♪♪ There's a spiritual battle, right? There really is, in the invisible spiritual realm a battle of good and evil that's going on and my kids are in the crosshairs, isn't that right? -Exactly. What is behind the evil of our universe, is a higher form of life. -Something we can't see? -Something not only can we not see, something we could never overcome without supernatural help. You consider the Apostle Paul's words from Ephesians chapter 6. That we "wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against rulers of the darkness of this age." There is a conspiracy that humanity is being manipulated. And it's our own desires that are used to manipulate our thoughts. The humanity at its most vulnerable state is children. -Why would the devil be threatened by children? -I believe that it is a testimony to the power of what a child can become. The command to fathers in the New Testament. "Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath, don't frustrate them, rather bring them up in the fear and admonition of the Lord." The person brought up in the fear and admonition of the Lord, a person equipped and trained, carries with them a power that accomplishes things. There's a devil and that devil wants to, if he cannot stop that, he wants to diminish the threat. The Son of God took that statement and said, "If you cause one of these little ones to stumble, to be offended, to derail in their faith, it'd be better for you to have millstone tied around your neck and you cast into the sea." That was to them, that was the darkness that no one ever returned from. The strongest expression with regard to judgment from the Son of God was in the context of our duty towards children. And specifically parental duty toward children. The Lord Jesus said, "I am the door." He didn't just say I'm the good shepherd, he said, "I am the door of the sheep fold. Nobody gets to the sheep except through me. You've gotta go by me." That is the role of a father, that is the role of a mother, to be the door. To be the one that, "anybody's gonna pass me, anybody's gonna influence this life, they've gotta go through me." And that requires vigilance. ♪♪♪ -I'm Evan. -I'm Kat and we have three children. And you can tell 'em where we met. -We met on Facebook. -[laughs] Yes, we did. Well, our children are 17, 3 and 2. Technology is in our life, almost 24/7. We've got a two year old that will get up at five or six in the morning and wake us up and ask for YouTube. And we have a 17 year old that we have to make sure is off the computer by 10 or 11 at night. -For me personally, the social media, it seems like once we kind of figure it out, there's something new coming out around the corner. Or it's already been out and I didn't know about it. -I was the bad mom that wouldn't let Ze'lee get a cell phone. "Everybody has a cell phone. Why can't I have a cell phone?" So she got a cell phone maybe ninth grade. It didn't feel like a big deal. In our naive, first time raising a teenager perspective, we did not know that we needed to have certain parameters on there. -The first time we had a major incident, I realized this is not the same as when we were 14 or 15. -When I was maybe seven or eight years old, a family member had showed me a Playboy image and it was this beautiful, blonde, naked woman. And he said to me, "This is what you're gonna look like when you grow up." Nothing happened after that, I was never violated. But, when I turned 18, I kind of looked like that girl, and so from 18, 19, 20, I worked in the sex industry, having no background whatsoever in any of that kind of stuff. And so as a mom - like, one image, I saw one image. It's a big deal, images are a big deal. So the first incident that we had was I found an app. It was like, hidden. And so I went into it and I found photos on there of my daughter and they weren't like these horrific pornographic photos, but they were definitely like, "whoa." This is 14, she's 14 or 13, whatever. One more year of this and it's off the deep end. Every girl wants to be wanted. It doesn't matter whether you're 50 or 14, a woman's desire is to be wanted. If you have what you think is a 14 year old boy saying, "Hey, you're really pretty." As a mom when I first saw those images on my daughter's tablet, my heart was so grieved knowing the value that one wrong image in a young person's brain, knowing the impact that it can make. My name is Roza Laven. I'm 25 years old. I was born and raised in Ukraine and in 2004 when I was 13 years old, my family moved to America. I was bullied a lot in school and I naturally isolated myself. Actually took my lunches and ate all my lunches in the bathroom. I didn't think that anybody's going through the same thing or anybody could understand me so I just kept it all to myself. My parents, the only thing they ever asked me is how my grades are. They never asked me about my friendships in school and I felt like I didn't want to bother them with the things that I'm dealing with in school. I was a freshman at 14. I got social media and I got to create my life the way I wanted to be seen. There were a few pictures that I had with my parents at my birthday. Although I don't have many happy memories, I still wanted to be viewed as though I did have a happy childhood. So I got to post those pictures, but those moments were extremely rare. For some reason two popular girls in school wanted to be friends with me. And although they would pick on me and make fun of my accent, I still wanted to be friends with them, because everybody liked them. We took pictures together and talked on social media. They weren't real friends. They have never known about what's going on at home, about the things that I'm going through. They just based the way they view me through my social media and through the things that I post. And I would try to become that in real life, even though it wasn't my true reality. -What I really noticed was social media in regards to in-depth friendships, is that there's a real lack of connection. That need for interaction with people is being met through social media, but it's like counterfeit. I can see one of my friends, they post something on there and I feel like I've connected with them, but I haven't connected with them. I see that a lot with my daughter. She has tons of Instagram friends, but she has no friends. Tons of Instagram friends, but no friends. Saturday will come and I'll say, "What are you doing today?" "Oh, I don't know." You know, "Why don't you go do something?" "I don't anybody to go with." "What do you mean you don't have anybody to go with?" "You have a million friends." "No, I don't have any friends." It's that you can see what's going on in someone's life but there's not that constant communication. "Hey you wanna go out to go have lunch? Let's go have coffee. Let's go surfing," you know. There's that lack of nurturing that is needed to build and grow friendships. ♪♪♪ -Hello, welcome to Chick-fil-A. How may I serve you today? -I'll take eight Chick-fil-A sandwiches with waffle fries. -Do you want meals for all eight? -No thanks, just the sandwich and the fries. -All right. -Okay, thank you. ♪♪♪ I have three sons and three daughters and we have only one opportunity to raise our kids, one shot. One chance. We don't get a do-over with parenting. They grow up so fast. Life doesn't come with a reboot button. And we're like guinea pig parents. We're the generation whose kids have grown up totally immersed in social media and technology. I mean, there's never been a generation like it. In a real way, we're blazing a new trail. We are the pioneer parents. I'm really concerned about these five lies that you told me about. What are the solutions to these five lies that parents can give to their kids? -Yeah you know, we need to get off the devices as much as we can and we need to be fully present with our kids. Young people have relationships that cause beliefs. So they prioritize people. And what's really interesting about it is that they're in relationships with people we don't know they're in relationships with. The people they follow on Twitter, we don't know they're following. So what does Peter believe and what does Jane believe and maybe what my mom believes, if I believe my mom is in a relationship with me. And what's really sad is that unfortunately in our culture today, just having the title mom and dad doesn't guarantee that I would define myself as having a relationship with you. I have a mom for instance, who when her kids get home from school. She immediately hangs up if she's on the phone with someone, she immediately turns off the TV. The first 30 minutes when her kids are home are their time and the kids know it. They've been raised to know that. So we need to be fully present and we need to engage and ask the questions. I think that's huge. -First lie, that the world revolves around me. What's the truth we should teach our kids with regard to that? -God is the center of the universe. -God is the center of the universe, not me. -Right, and again how are our kids gonna learn that, Kirk? Do we behave as if that's true? Do they hear us pray? Do they see the scripture open when we have decisions to make? Do we gripe on the way to church? So again, for us as adults, is God the center? And what's the evidence of that? And if there's no evidence in my life that he's the center, why would I expect my kids to want to place him at the center? -Lie number two is... -I deserve to be happy all the time. And the truth would be that we can have joy in all of our circumstances. -Joy rather than happiness. What's the difference? -Yeah, joy is an emotional, deep-centered response to the world. It's again, part of that gratitude coin, where I can have joy because of Jesus. -As opposed to circumstances being the way I want and I'm happy because the world's running the way I want it too. -Exactly. -The third lie is... -I deserve choice, or I must have choice. You might say that again choice is a privilege, not a guarantee. So grow up and handle it. When you're told that bedtime's 8:30, go to bed, stop complaining and whining. But I would also say that you can handle the choices when you seek wisdom and when you seek to make your choices based on unwise decision making. -Lie number four. -I am own authority. The main truth would be that God is the ultimate authority. He can be trusted, his word is forever true, will never be outdated. His character will never change. His love is unconditional, his wisdom is for us, his power, his passion - right, we could go on and on. -It's so important. -All of us were created to have authority above us. So the whole submission idea. Again I would say to parents, do you live as if God is your authority? And what's the evidence? -That's right. Why would I expect my kids to consider God the authority in their life, if they're looking to me and I'm not living that way? -Exactly. Are we complaining about our pastors? Are we running late to church? Do we not open the Bible when we have decisions to make? Kid comes to you and says, "Daddy, I was so hurt." Do you pray in the moment? "Oh Father God, heal my son's heart. And help my son cope with this; protect him tomorrow." Nothing better to explain to your kid that you love and that you want him to come to you. -And then seeing you go right to the source of your hope, and your provision, and your protection and your blessing. -Absolutely. -Okay, and the fifth lie is, all I need is information. -Right, right. -How do we counteract that? -Again, ask God for wisdom. So again, do they hear us seek God and his Word for wisdom and the fact that they think they don't need teachers. Again, do they see us being under the authority of educators, if you will. Do we go to Sunday school? Do we go and do we sit and do we take notes in sermon? And I think for us, do we dig deep? Do we persevere for wisdom? -I'm kind of excited. I think I might be doing that, modeling that part right now by talking to you. [laughs] -Then my kids watch this. -Yes. -And they say "Hey, Dad's seeking this out. Dad thinks that there's really some authority, some experts in some fields that can help him help us." -You know, Kirk, one of the most important things that I think I want people to understand is that it's not young people's fault that they are this way. It's not their fault they believe the five lies, it's not their fault that they're impatient and entitled and self-centered and angry. We would be like them if we were their age, because the technology is rewiring their brain, it's what they're doing in their spare time. It's not their fault. Now here's what I would say to young people. It's not your fault you're impatient because of Google and the click of the mouse and the GPS and the DVR and all of this kind of thing, but it doesn't make it an excuse to be obnoxious. It's not an excuse to be disobedient. It's not an excuse to be impatient, especially if you're a follower of Christ. 'Cause he calls us to be patient; it's the Fruit of the Spirit. He's not gonna rewrite the Bible for your generation. -Good point. -Patience is always going to be a Fruit of the Spirit. So you show up and you grow up. It's gonna be hard for them, but we need to say to them it's worth it. Sin, there's a penalty for it and you don't wanna be living there. ♪♪♪ That conversation just empowered me. It reminded me of the importance of the role of a parent. I am a father. My wife, she is my children's mother. And you are the perfect parent for your child. God made us for this job. And if we don't help our kids by preparing them for this world and replacing these five big lies with the truth about who they are and why they're here and their ideas about God and family and the world around them, who will? ♪♪♪ -At the point, I decided that I needed to actually find out who this person was. And I had fortunately printed out every single picture that was on his Facebook, every connection he had. I mean I had a binder before I even had called him. -Yeah. -Well, within a few minutes of calling him, all of... -Let me guess. He deleted everything. -Everything. It's... [clicks fingers], one at a time. And not only that, all of his friends' pictures starting going down. It turns out all these friends, ultimately I found out, were all fake. He used them as traps. I basically started to try to reconstruct who this person might be to try to figure it out. It ultimately led me to find a bunch of different user ID's across the web that I thought belonged to this person based upon characteristics and language and stuff like that. I came across a user ID that was JSD210. And I said "Wow, 210, that could be February 10th," and today's February 11th. And I went and I looked at it, what the pictures had said how old he was two days earlier, and at the time he was 42 in the pictures that I had printed out, and now the profile said he was 43. He had told my son he was gonna come get him. So you're kind of like, "What are you gonna do?" -You gotta take it serious, that's right. -I was looking at birth certificates, land records, deeds, I mean you name it. Anything I could find that might have initials and could lead me to a date of birth. Ultimately, I found this person who was with that initials born on February 10, 1966. It was, it was the guy. Turned out he was a school teacher at a middle school. He was a lacrosse coach. He made a living interacting with people my son's age all day, everyday. So he was very comfortable interacting with and relating to... -Right. -And playing that kind of mentoring type role, and he used that to exploit people. The phone number he'd used along the way wasn't really him. He had used a stolen identity from a deceased person to get it. So I couldn't go that way, but I did get to his mom. And called his mom and said, "Hey, is this person there?" And she said, "No, you just missed him." And I said, "Could you deliver a message for me?" And she said, "Sure." I said, "Can you tell him that Tim Woda called and tell him I gotcha." And so we took all of this and all these ID's and all these connections to the Center for Missing and Exploited Children, they connected me with the cyber crimes unit of the state police, who had me in their office in like 30 minutes. And they took all of the stuff and they interviewed my son. Maybe a month or two later, I get a call from the state's attorney who says, "I just wanna let you know you're gonna see on the news tonight that we arrested this guy." And he said that he had like 250,000 incidences in his machines of situations where he had solicited young people. And they said he was a relatively typical child predator. And ultimately he ended up going to prison and being sentenced. After the dust settled, right, I said, "How could I have avoided this?" And I realized that the problems that I had was one, relational, there were issues in the relationship with my son that allowed for this to happen. And two, was that I just needed more information. Just to put a perspective into this, if you go into an average high school, by the time those kids have graduated, one in four of those kids will admit to having sent a naked picture of themselves to a friend or stranger. The average number of friends that a teenager has online is hundreds or thousands. There may not even be that many kids in their school. They're certainly not all their friends. They're more like strangers that have been identified. And so for a parent to think that your child knows the quality of the character of those people is fantasy land, let alone mom and dad knowing the quality of the character of those people. But we need to be able to help shape how they interact with and think about it. How the process it. How to make sense of it through the lens of their faith, through the lens of the morality that you're trying to instill in your kids. It forces parents to deal with the reality on the ground, instead of the reality that they wish existed that doesn't. ♪♪♪ What my kids need more than anything else, more than technology, more than a new app, they need a transformation of their heart so that they want to do what's good and right.

What happened to the devil? -The evil one thought that through manipulating humanity, Herod and Pilate, the religious leaders in their envy. This is the hero, this is the one that is supposed to crush his head, gets him killed. It's the words, "It is finished." The crushing blow to Satan's head was dealt by Christ on the cross. It is through Jesus Christ, it is through the accomplishment of Christ upon the cross that there is victory for us. That there is a means for us to not be at the mercy of this predator. The Apostle Paul says, "That we are more conquerors, through him." Christ paid the price and we reap the benefit. -I love that. Christ paid the price for me, for my kids, for you, for your family, and we reap the benefits. You know, it feels to me like there are several worlds that we interact with. We've got the physical world, this world where we live every day. And there is the reality of the spiritual world, where forces of good and evil are at war, animating what's going on in the physical world. And now there's this new world, this weird virtual, digital world. And on the outside it looks great and our kids have been given a portal into it.

And they've come back to help mentor kids through a recovery process. ♪♪♪ What do you say to parents that say, "I didn't jump on this 10 years ago when I should have. Is it too late for my kids and me?" -Right, right. It's never too late, because kids long to have discussions. I think what's happened is a lot of parents have just been flat blindsided by this whole internet thing. It's as new to us as it is to our kids. We are being consumed by everything that we hold in our hands. Every screen that we look at, an average of 10 hours a day. The tools that we're giving them during their adolescent years is gonna determine how the rest of their years will be. It'll determine who they marry. It'll determine how they parent their kids. It will change their life and if we allow, I think, our kids to be consumed by anything that keeps us from having that highway into their life of communication, then we're missing out and our kids are gonna pay the price somewhere. -I have six teenage kids. I can pray for them, I can protect them, I can try to put the walls around and provide for them, but at the end of the day, I know that they're stepping into a world where I can no longer protect them. -That hedge that you put around them, that control that you had was easy when they were either 1 through 12 years of age. But when they turn 13, you don't have control anymore. That hedge doesn't work. You can't be responsible for them, they need to be responsible for themselves. It's switching from a teaching mode to a training mode. Instead of me taking on all the responsibility, I'm gonna start transferring responsibility. Me making all the decisions in the earlier years, I'm gonna let them start making decisions. But the tendency is, if I make all their decisions, they're never learning. So when they face all the big stuff in life, they can't pick it up and run with it, because I've been doing it for them. Sometimes I think that when Scripture says that we are to train up a child, it doesn't say teach. Teach is what we do in the early years. Train is what we do in the adolescent years. But it's all about moving them from dependence to independence. From us having lectures all the time, to now having discussions. From me telling to now sharing. Knowing that they're gonna make mistakes, that they're gonna make poor choices, but I'm gonna let them do it anyway because I am more intent on having them take control of their life than having me control it for the next 10 years. Because if I do that, I'm ruining their marriage. They will be a poor parent, if they don't take control of their life. I cannot live my life through them. -That's a difficult transition. -It is. -I'm right there, I'm right there at that transition stage right now and it's, you love your kids so much that you just wanna protect 'em and protect 'em. "Don't do that, that's gonna be bad for you. It's gonna be painful, don't do it, been there." Really, you're speaking to me a lot right now. -Well, do you really think that it's wise for a child that's age 16 to get a license and drive through Los Angeles or Dallas? Do you think that's really a wise move? -No. -I don't think it is either. But you know what? All of 'em do. And they do pretty well. And they learn and they transition, and there's a few bumps along the way. They'll back into something, somebody will hit them. They'll make a poor decision, they may even get lost along the way. But you know, they transition and they do well. We've got to give our kids a chance to flourish, to take what we've taught them and apply it so that when they make mistakes, I can still speak truth into their life during the time that they're still listening to me. Because when then turn 18 or 19 and they're gone, they're not gonna be listening to me a whole lot, except at a distance. -My wife does this so much better than I do. And I, I am so grateful for what you're saying right now. It's so true. And you have thousands of parents that come to you and say the exact same thing. -It's the toughest transition, I think, in parenting. -It is. -It's the toughest transition. It's like sending a daughter off to get married. It's trusting that the next stage is gonna be okay. -And I think for me, I so... I believe that things will go better for my children if they don't make mistakes, because mistakes lead to painful consequences. And I wanna prevent that. But what you're saying that's getting me teary, is that perhaps it's better to allow your children the freedom to make the mistakes, knowing the painful consequences that will come, to have the opportunity to be the one there to speak wisdom to them and have them want to come talk with you about it. Because bad decisions are inevitable. We're human, we're broken, we're sinful, we're rebellious. I am too. -But what happens is those consequences validate everything that you have taught them. -Yes, it - -Validates it. -And validates that God's Word is true. And it doesn't mean I lose anything, it means I deepen everything. So what I'm really doing is creating an arena for change and letting the Word of God, that's been planted in their life, continue to come to fruition. I want them to search with all their heart and go, "Okay, why do I need this relationship with Christ? Why do I need to be right with God? What is it about the void in my life that God can fill?" And if I never give them the opportunity to experience that sense of need, that they truly need that, they're never gonna truly embrace everything that we've been teaching them. That why scripture says train up a child, not teach up a child. That's what you do in the early years. Train up a child. ♪♪♪ -I didn't pull the trigger just because I didn't have the guts. My friend that I was smoking weed with, his mom bought us like, tickets to a conference. And so we went. I experienced God's love and it was something so unreal, something I've never felt before. So what happened was the pastor that was preaching, but he said, "If you've had suicidal thoughts, stand up." I stood up. "If you've been bullied, if you've been bullied at all, stand up." And I stood up again. "If your parents have been divorced, stand up." I stood up again and I was like, "What the heck? This guy's just basically, just naming my life." And he pointed at me and he said, "You have a huge purpose. You're in this world for a reason." Whatever you've been told in your life, whatever's happened in your life, ignore that. You are a child of God, you are loved by God and that God sees you as the amazing person in the world." Like, that changed my whole mentality, my whole motivation, just because this is something I had wanted to hear. And just to hear that I have a purpose, just everything changed. -So I was about 18 and I just had a moment with God, where I was just like, "You know, Lord, if you're real, I need to get out of this place that I'm in, this situation that I'm in." I think, I mean, it was literally night and day, I woke up and told my parents I'm leaving the city, I'm leaving home and I'm gonna go start my new life. There's some things that gotta be cut off and one thing was, hey, I wanna be able to tell my kids "Hey, I'm totally free from this." And I'm not a hypocrite but also it's a process that we have to go through and I'm willing to go through it with you cause I know what it takes." Jesus was my over-comer. -I allowed other people's words and what they thought of me, which wasn't anything positive, to shape my identity. January 2016, I came to City Church, Judah was preaching about the grace of God. I was almost kind of angry that I have never known about the grace of God. I just felt like for 24 years of my life, I've been trying so hard. The grace of God was a game changer for me, because I stopped even seeking approval of friends that didn't matter. I just knew that God is pleased with me, that my identity's in him and that I'm enough. More than anything, that I'm enough and I'm valuable. And I don't need to prove that to anybody. Raising kids is by far the hardest thing that I've ever done. But my wife and I would also tell you that it's the best thing that we've ever done. Nothing has caused us to grow more than raising our six kids. Parenting, it's a sacred duty and a high calling.
