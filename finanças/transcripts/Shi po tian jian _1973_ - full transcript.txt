(dramatic music) (gong bangs) (intense music) (ship horns blare) (group chattering) - This one. (hand whacks) - Hey, sorry. - Hey, lady? Hello? How's things? Hmm? - Not good, I'm afraid. - All there? All right. Where's the rest, aye? - Well, I'm sorry. Don't have it. Like I said, business isn't good. - What's that? You know the rules by now. Right. (pots shatter) - No, please! Please, no! (baby cries) You got talk to them. - Yeah, yeah. Sorry, please give us a little time. - We want all the money. Right now! - Just have patience. You see, it'll take just a few days. - Right. I'm gonna give you till tomorrow, but if you haven't got it then, you're in trouble. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Hmm. Hi, there. How's things? - Ah... - (laughs) That's good. You're a smart guy, huh? - Uh, good morning, sir. - Yeah, all right. Have you got the money ready? - Uh, sorry, not just yet. (chuckles nervously) - What? - It's been a really bad month. - You trying to say you won't pay? - Oh, no, no, I mean, no, please don't! (pots shattering) No, no! Business is very bad now. - Come on. You only have to pay up once a month. - I don't have it, though. - In that case, you'll go out of business, won't you? - There's nothing I can do! (fist whacks) Uh! - You stupid fool! - We're gonna teach you a lesson, and then the next time, you'll have it all ready. - Right. - Yeah. (fists whacking) (dramatic music) Is it all right to you? (man groans) You'll pay! (foot and fist whacks) Sorry, old fella. Got here a little late. - Yeah. (grunts) (fists and feet whacking) (grunting) - Hey! - Huh? (intense music) Who are you? - None of your business, you crummy little rat. - What? (all grunting) (fists and feet whacking) (elbow whacks) (groans) (screams) (fists and feet whacking) (all grunting) (groaning) (hands whack) (grunting) (fists and feet whacking) Come on, come on! (breathing heavily) (groaning) - Hold it! Well the next time, y'all know what to expect. - Sure, sure. - Boy, he really fixed them. - Did you see that? He really fixed them, huh? - Really. - Hey, hey, let's give him the money. - Yeah. - Come on, come on, give it to him. - Yeah, that's it. - Hey, you really did us a good turn then, huh? - Right, we're very much in your debt now. - Yeah. - Yeah. Here you are. Please take it. - Go on, take it. - Yeah. - I didn't do it for money. - We know that, but take it. - Come on. - Yeah. - Yeah, take it. - Well all right, then. - All right, good. (crowd chattering) - That's the one, that's the one. - Now quiet, now. And I'll start the contest. - Hey, hey, it's starting. - Right, begin. - Go on, go on! (crowd cheering) (fists whacking) (crowd cheering) (fists and feet whacking) (crowd cheering) - Get him! - Yeah, come on! (feet whacking) (crowd cheering) (fists and feet whacking) (crowd cheering) (crowd applauds) - Come on, pay up. (crowd chattering) - Terrific, really. - Here we are. Count it. (dramatic music) (fists and feet whacking) (all grunting) (fists and feet whacking) (all grunting) - You're damn good. (fists whacking) (fists whacking) - She isn't bad, aye? - Yeah, you're right. - Maybe even a Virgin, huh? - Yeah. (both laugh) (intense music) - Yeah, come on! - Come on, you. - No, let me go! - Come on. - Come on, sugar. - No! - Come here. - No! Stop it! - Bring her over here. Yeah. Hey, she's really very cute, aye? Should we deliver her to the old bastard? He'll do well for her. - Right, he likes the young ones, huh? - Let's try her out first. - Yeah. Good idea. - Oh, no! No, leave me alone! - Come on, get her over here on the slide here. - Yeah, get her down. - No, no! No! - Get her over here now. - Stop it! - Oh, there we go. - No! (laughing) (gasping) (all laughing) - Come on. Don't mess around. I'll take her first. - Oh please, let me go now, oh! (gasping) (men laughing) (fist whacks) (dramatic music) - Who are you? - Damn you! (knife scrapes) What do you want? (knife whooshes) (fists and feet whacking) (all grunting) (merry go round clatters) (fists whacking) (all grunting) (seesaw clanks) (groans) (fists and feet whacking) (both grunting) (fist whacks) - Let's go! - Let's get outta here! - Wait! Take your friend with you. - Let's go, come on. (man groans) Come on. (water flows) - Thank you. - You all right? - Yes. I'm very grateful, Mr. Chiang. - Oh, and how did you know who I am? - You're well known through the whole county. You're famous but still, afraid I have no money to pay you. - Pay me? I helped you. I don't want pay. (gentle music) (alarm clock rings) (dramatic music) (door opens) Oh, it's you. - You men may be tough, but there's some things women do better. - You shouldn't have come here. - Just to show that I'm grateful. - Let's get this straight. I never expected any payment. - But (sighs)... - Now look, you simply can't stay here. (scoffs) Listen now. Don't get mad. It's just for your own. (dramatic music) - I did all your laundry this morning. - Now, miss. - My name's June Sun. - Well, Miss Sun, what about your parents, aye? Do they know you're here? (gentle music) - No, they don't. They're dead. Have been a long time, so I'm all alone. That's why I'd like to have a friend. (cries) - I'm sorry. There's no way I can help you. (cries) Miss Sun? You already know the sort of guy I am. I'm just no good. Got a bad name. Reckless, work shy. Never worry about tomorrow. (gentle music) (knock on door) - Are you Mr. Chiang Tai-kang? - Yeah, that's right. - This is for you. - Thanks. (dramatic music) (train horn blares) (train chugging) (gentle music) - What worries me most of all is what's to become of my boy to come. Always fighting, got not job. You'll come to a bad end. (dramatic music) - Huh, you still believe in that? - If it helps Dad, I'll try anything. - The last train will have come by now. If your brother's not on that, he's not coming. (dramatic music) (dog barks) - It's him! He came after all! - How's Dad? - Bad. Very sick. And the only reason he's still hanging on to life is just to see you. - Call the doctor? - It's no use. There isn't any help. Tai-kang, you remember him, Mr. Ying Ho. - Ah. We used to collect shells together when we were kids. - Yeah, long time ago. I just finished at the university last month. - Oh, you have already graduated. That's great. Ma. (gasping) Dad? (somber music) - You finally came, did you? (gasps) I've been waiting a long time. Go on now. I want to speak to Tai-kang alone. (gasping) (coughs) You'll have to take charge of the family now. (coughs) - Come on, Dad. You'll make it. - Don't bother to kid me. I know damn well I'm dying. I want you to promise to settle down now, and make sure our bit of land always stays in the family. And I want you to give up this fighting. It'll be hard. I know that. But you must, you've got to promise me. - Take it easy. Dad. - It's a lot to ask of you, but it's for your own good. Will you give me your word? - I'll stay at home. Look after the land and sister and ma. (coughs) - And what else? - I... I won't fight. - All right. You promise me now. Promise me. (dramatic music) - In the name of God, I promise you. I'll do what you ask. I swear. I'll not fight anymore. Dad! Dad! - What is, oh, Dad! Dad! Dad! Oh, Dad! (sobbing) (gasps) Tai-kang. - Are you Chiang Tai-kang? - That's my name. - I've often heard of you. - Who are you? (laughs) - Name's Lee, but people usually call me Black Fan. But anyway, like to talk to you. - Uh, what about? (laughs) - You're a lucky man. My boss sent me. He wants to buy your land for cash. - Well he can't. I won't sell. That's that. Come on. - Hey, hey. (laughs) At least considerate it. He'll pay you well. - My land is not for sale. - Hey, hey. I'll give you a word of advice. Don't be too stubborn. My boss wants this land, and he's got a lot of influence. - Don't give a damn! The land's not for sale! - Fool! - Tai-kang? - Hmm. - You better be more careful. His boss is a big man. He's a rich guy who recently moved into the neighborhood. And he's really vicious too, so I hear. (intense music) - This area is the main link between the North and the South. And the new road will be going through here soon. Hmm. It looks good. I can really clean up here. (laughs) Yeah, I'll make a fortune. - But there was one little snag, sorry to say. You see, I went to see Chiang, but it's no use. He says he won't sell now or ever. I know that kid, and he's damn tough. - Just what is that supposed to mean? We can't handle him? Come on. We've got some good men. And don't forget that my uncle happens to be the provincial commissioner. I don't think we'll have much trouble. (dart whooshes) (fan flapping) - Mm. - Hey boss, our friends from Hebei are arriving today. - Huh. Well what do you think? I should go and meet them? - Well, it would give them face. Might be an idea. - Well, I hope that they're better than that last lot. - Mm-hmm. Don't worry about that. These two have a reputation of being the best fighters in Hebei province, so they should be damn good. - Hmm. Hmm. Well, you go down first. Take Black Fan. I'll be down later. - Mm, ah... - Well, all right. Oh, hang on. When you meet these two new guys, try them out with a little test. - Hmm. - Nothing too rough, just try them out. - Right. - Right. (train chugging) (horn blares) (brakes shrieking) (steam hissing) - Mm. (horn blares) - Yeah, huh. (train chugging) Over there. - Oh. - There he is. - Ah well, you made it. It's quite a trip, isn't it? (laughs) Glad you came. I must say, you both look in pretty good shape. (all laugh) - And so do you. Judging by your clothes, things must be good here. - (laughs) Not too bad. This is Mr. Hang Chu. And this is Mr. Chow. This is my brother, but he's better known as Black Fan. - Uh, hello. Hi, there. - Hi. - Hi. - Yes. - Uh, please, let me do it. - No, it's all right. - I'll carry it for you. - No, no, I can manage. - No, no, no, please. - No, it's all right. - Be my guest. - Uh, please. (chuckles) (bowl bends) (intense music) Oh, I'm sorry. I seem to have bent it a bit. - It's all right. I'll fix it. (bowl bends) (laughs) - Now then, that's what I like to have around. A couple of real strong men. - I'd better introduce you. Now then, my boss, Mr. Wong. Very rich man, has a lot of property and influence too. An expert knife thrower. Probably the best there is. - How do you do? - I've heard a lot about that. You're very well known. I envy you. - (chuckles) Thank you. I'm glad you've come. I hope you'll stay. - I must admit that knife throwing has always fascinated me. Perhaps you'll show me some time. (laughs) - Um, maybe he will, but he reserves that for his close friends. (horn blares) (train chugging) (knives whooshing and banging) - Oh my God, that's unbelievable. - Come on. - Where can I find Mr. Chiang? - Oh, over there. - Oh, thank you. (crowd chattering) - Hey, miss. Remember me? We came on the same train. I hear you're looking for Mr. Chiang. If so, there's a friend of his here. There he is. - Does your friend's name happen to be Chiang Tai-kang? - Yes, it is. - Whoa, fancy that. He's a very good friend of mine, but his father just died though. - (gasps) That right? - He's taking it hard. He's drinking a lot. - Hey, listen. He's coming to my friend's place. Wait for him there. - Please. - Please. (chickens cluck) (crowd chattering) - Where is it? (laughs) - If you'd rather not come with us, let me know where he can get you. And then I can tell him to call on you. - No, it's not that at all, but it's a lot of trouble for you. - Oh, no. Of course not. After all, you're a friend of his. It's the least I can do. Please. - Please. (gentle music) Please. (dice clink) - Dammit all! - No, panicked. - Oh, just look, just look at this mess here, huh? (fan taps) - Who's that? - Please. (fan whips) (gentle music) - Uh... - Now, don't you worry. He'll be along soon. - Hey, there's a new one. (fan flutters) - You get lost. - (chuckles) Who's our honorable guest, then? She isn't bad looking at all. - Uh. - Where'd you get her? - Get out. - I see. That's how it is. You've got a new friend. - You've got it all wrong. She's waiting for a friend. - Oh. So you think, but I've seen that look in your eye too many times now. (gentle music) - What sort of place is this? What sort of place is this? (chuckles) - Uh-uh. - When is Mr. Chiang coming? - (laughs) Take a look around here. (groaning) (groaning) (gasps) - Hey, Pi Sum. When I came, I forgot my present for you. But now then, it seems that I've got a present for you after all. - Uh, no! - Hey! Uh-uh. (laughs) - I don't think your friend will be coming. He never goes out since his father died. - No, let me go! No! - Come here! Come with me! (fist whacks) - Huh. (fist whacks) (groaning) (foot whacks) - Come on! (groaning) Come on with me, you bitch! Come on! - No, please! - Come on! - Don't! (crowd chattering) - Can I help you? - Yeah, that one. - Now come on. What is all this? Why can't I go in? Hey, you can't stop me - Come on, get out! - going in. Let me talk to your boss. - Get outta here! - Come on then, you can't do this to me. - Come on, get out! - Where's your boss? - I've had my orders. - To hell with orders! I wanna go in! - All right. I'm the boss here. - Well, I'm glad you came out here. He won't let me in, and I've told him I've got plenty of money. - Go to hell! - Huh, what is all this? I'm a good customer. - Damn you! (fist whacks) (objects clattering) (fists and feet whacking) (both grunting) (table collapses) (fists whacking) (groaning) (foot whacking) (groaning) (dirt pattering) (water spraying) (broom scrapes) (dog barks) - Oh, hey! Look what you're doing! Uh! - Uh, just you shut up! From now on, these aren't your crops. Huh. (grunts) - What is all this? (laughs) - Just warming you up for a little fight. - The last time you wouldn't consider my offer to buy your land. This time I hope you use your head. - Hey! Hey! Are you deaf or just dumb? What do you say? - Nothing at all. - Now listen here, you're not a bad kid. That's why I didn't push you. But this time, I really mean business. - It's not for sale. - You have to sell! - And I said, no! (pole snaps) (chuckles) - You're just wasting time. What this fool needs is a lesson! (gasps) - I only know about farming but not fighting. - Huh, is that so? Well we'll see. (dramatic music) Huh? (laughs) (spits) (grunts) (Black Fan laughs) (grunts) - Uh. - Huh, huh. (hand slaps) - Uh! (laughs) Oh! Uh! - Come on! (laughs) (gasping) - Let go! (man laughs) (sister gasping) (hand whacks) (man laughing) Let me go! (gasping) (man laughing) Let me go! Let me go! (broom whacks) (foot whacks) (broom whacks) (fist whacks) (screams) (dramatic music) - Hey, look. (men grunting) - What's happening here? So much noise. Oh. Tai-kang, not fighting are you? - No. We, we were just playing around. - Oh. (fan snaps) - Hey, let's get back. Come on then. Huh. I'll say this much for you, my friend. You're a damn good actor. anyway. But you wait though. Within three days, you're gonna regret all this. Huh. (fan snaps) Right? - Let's go. - Come on. (spits) - Come on. They've all gone. Let's go inside. - Yes. Come on now. You're not well. You better go to bed. (gentle music) - Why doesn't the law help? (sighs) - I'm pretty sure they'll come here again. But Tai-kang promised Dad that he'd never fight again. - That's good. I agree. I'm personally opposed to violence. - But this is only the beginning though. We'll hear more from them. But we're not living in the Dark Ages. We've got the law to protect us. - But they don't care about the law. It doesn't mean anything to them. (ominous music) - That may be true right now, but we should be prepared to give the law a chance. - Now come on. We all know they're completely in control of this place. - I think we should inform the local authorities. The town clerk here, he's an old friend of mine. And if they try to pull anything else here, then I'll make sure they get arrested. (ominous music) - Do you think the law really will help? Come on. What's your opinion? - Maybe, at least we can try it. - Well, I'll go and see them now. Hey. - Mm-hmm. (intense music) (foot whacks) (bike chain clatters) (feet whacking) - All right, you! I'll get you! (intense music) (bike clattering) (tires screech) (bike clattering) (intense music) (screams) (intense music) (bike clattering) (tires screech) (bike thuds) (screams) (rocks pattering) (intense music) (bike clattering) (grunts) (dirt pattering) (fists and feet whacking) (both grunting) (fist thuds) (both grunting) (fists whacking) (both grunting) (foot whacks) (groaning) (fists whacking) (both grunting) (screams) (foot whacks) (groans) (fist whacks) (foot whacking) (groaning) (fist whacking) (groaning) (foot whacking) (laughs) - Uh. (groaning) (foot whacks) (groaning) (men laugh) (fist whacks) (groans) (knee whacks) (groans) (fists and feet whacking) (groaning) (train horn blares) (train chugging) (fist whacking) (groaning) - Just leave him. Come on. (groans) Quick! (train chugging) - Chiang must be pretty stupid. He must know that he's beat. So why doesn't he sell? (sighs) - Uh. I know how you feel, but he's a tough nut. - Now look, let me take care of him. - Hmm, all right. But if you can't do the job then I've got another plan. (sighs) Hmm. (fan snap) Here. (fan taps) (indistinct whispering) - Yeah, that's a very good idea. - Yeah, sure. - All right. Get the damn lot of them. (blows) (dramatic music) (birds shrieks) (gasps) - Oh, my God! (groans) Ying Ho. Ying Ho. (bright music) (groans) - You and your law. This law, what has the law done for you? Not a damn thing. - We have to give the law a chance. Didn't get there today, but I will tomorrow. - Daughter. - Uh. (groans) She's worried. Tai-kang went out to look for you. It's getting late. I wonder where he's got to. (gas sloshing) (intense music) (gas splashing) Listen. It's quite dark. So if you like, you stay here. Hmm? (sniffs) What's that odd smell? (sniffs) (dramatic music) (fire crackling) Uh, fire! (fire roaring) (gasps) (fire roaring) (gasps) (fire roaring) (wood cracks) (coughing) (gasping) (fire roaring) We better get mother up! - You get out first! (intense music) (fire roaring) Ma! Hurry up! (gasps) (knife whacks) (groans) (screams) (knife whacks) (intense music) (fire roars) (roof collapses) (screams) (all laugh) (intense music) (fire roaring) (gasps) (dramatic music) - Ma! Ma! Ma! (dramatic music) Oh, no! (somber music) (intense music) I'll get them! I'll get them! (screams) (trees snap) (screams) (headstone breaks) (intense music) (lightning strikes) (commissioner laughing) (all laugh) - Well you're in very rare form tonight, Mr. Commissioner. - Ooh. - Right let's drink. (laughs) - Mm. (laughs) - Go on, have some more. - Mm? - Go on. (laughs) Go on. (gentle music) It's very good wine. Isn't it? - Mm-hmm. Mm. - Don't do that. - Mm. - Let's drink to your health. - Huh? Uh-huh, uh-huh. - Drink up. - Uh-huh. - Now about the Chiang's land. (gulps) - Ooh. - Have some. - Uh. Ooh. (laughs) Ah. - More. - Mm, mm. - Commissioner, Mr. Pi would like to have a word with you. - Yes, I know. - Have some more. - It's about that piece of land but I thought you'd already bought it. - But the owner unfortunately died before they could actually sign the deed. - And so you see, we'd be grateful for your help. - Oh. - Of course, there'll be the usual fee though. (laughs) - Usual? - Double the usual then. - Yeah, it was a very sad case. Really quite tragic. Three, four people burned beyond recognition. - But nevertheless though, you think you can help us? - Um, ah. I really mustn't have anything else to drink. Must get back to work. (soft music) I really must get back now. Thank you. A nice meal. (laughs) - Well, I do hope you can help us. - Oh, sir. - Huh? - Your briefcase - Oh. (laughs) Thank you very much, indeed. Rely on me. I'll fix it. Uh? (all laugh) - Uh, listen. - Huh? - We've got new girls. Drop by and try them sometime. - Oh. (laughs) - All right. You show the commission out. Mm? - Right. - Goodbye. Goodbye. (laughs) (soft music) - You all alone, huh? - I meant to ask you, how's the new girl coming along? Is she working yet? - Hmm, she simply won't do it. - Bring her here! - You heard him. Bring the girl in. - Yes. - Right. - Have you told her yet about her boyfriend dying? - Hmm, why should I, uh? After all, there was nothing left of him except cinders. Hmm, I know you. You mean to have her. I'm right, aren't I? - Huh. - Let me go! (gasps) (fan snaps) - Oh, poor little girl. They you say you don't like it here. - Yeah. I know what's coming. You will make your feel better, huh? - Come out here, you can help serve the drink. (fan snaps) And give her some chopsticks and bring more food. - Mm. - Go on. Don't be scared. He's a real gentleman. You're very lucky. He seems to fancy you. (laughs) All the new girls, they're always scared. At first, that is. But they usually get to like it. (laughs) - Mm. Mm? (fan snaps) Bring her here. - Yes. - Go on. It's very good food. (soft music) (chuckles) - Now that's better. I hope you're going to cooperate. (chopsticks clatter) Hmm? (fan bangs) Stupid bitch. Well if that's the way you want it, I'm more than willing to abide. Bring me a rope! - Yes. (laughs) - Tie my hands. - Yes. (rope rustling) - Going to show off, huh? - Just so she doesn't get any ideas. (rope snaps) (laughs) Take her over there. - Come on. - No! No, please! No, don't! Let me go! I beg you, please! No, leave me alone! Let me go! No, please, please don't! No, no, no, no! (laughing) Let me go! (laughing) No, leave me alone. No! No, let me go! No, let me go! Let me go! Let me go! No! - Hmm. It's your own stupid fault, you know? I did give you a chance. - Oh, no! Oh, please, no! No! No! (laughs) Oh, no! Oh! - Yeah. (gasping) (grunts) (gasping) - Wait, someone wants you. - Damn, can't you see I'm busy? - Sorry, but it's your brother though. And he says it's very important. - Tell him to wait! - I can't. I think something must have gone badly wrong. He's looking as though the sky fell in on him. (grunts) (June gasping) There's no hurry. She isn't leaving. You can have her any time you want. - What's so damn important? Dammit, now speak up! - Well we managed to find what was left of Chiang, but then we couldn't find any trace of the women. - How come? (door opens) Hmm. You told me you'd kill them and started a fire and then burnt them so there'd be no evidence. - Huh. Hey, it's been more than a day. So maybe they've been eaten by stray dogs. - That is impossible. There must be some trace left. We must find him. Go and make a search! (branches rustling) - We better work out where we're gonna start. Search the woods first. (branches rustling) (dramatic music) Just hang on. Wait for me. (intense music) (both laugh) (feet whack) (head bangs) (groans) (foot whacks) (hand whacks) (groans) (intense music) (fists whacking) (feet whacking) (intense music) (rock whacks) (groans) (feet and hands whacking) - Hey, no, wait! Oh, I, I give up. - All right then. Where's your boss? And those stinking pack rats of his? Come on, speak up! - I don't know! (feet whacking) (fists whacking) - Talk! - Uh, in town! All of them! You go, you'll find them there. Black Fan's there, he's at home. And so is Pi. He's there too. And for the boss, don't know. Maybe you can try, try his house. Uh, let go! - Well that's fine. Keep talking. I want you to tell me every damn thing you know about them. (grunts) (hand whacks) (bone cracks) (screams) You might beat me and the others. Like Fan and Chow-fu. (groans) Guess you might beat them. - And Fantai, what about him? - You'll never beat him. And you'll never get anywhere near the boss either. (groans) He'd get you with his knives. You wouldn't have a chance. (intense music) (gasps) Not you! (knee and fist whack) (fists and feet whacking) (fist whacks) (gasping) - It's this one. - No. - Hmm. Hey, when were they buried? - Hmm, don't know. - Hmm. All right. - Thank you. Thank you. - Yeah, yeah. - Hold it! (intense music) - Huh? Oh, it's you, aye? (grunts) (fist whacks) (grunts) (fists and feet whacking) (grunting) Damn you! (fists and feet whacking) (wood whooshes) (fists whacking) (screams) (fists and feet whacking) (grunting) (fists and feet whacking) (grunting) (screaming) (fists and feet whacking) (grunting) (fists and feet whacking) (grunting) (grunting) (fists and feet whacking) (grunting) (fists and feet whacking) (grunting) (body whooshing) (fists and feet whacking) (grunting) (feet and fists whacking) (foot whacking) (feet whacking) (groaning) (head cracking) (groaning) (dramatic music) - You'll never be Pi, and the bus will get you with his knives for sure. - Must have been the same gang. And the question is now who the hell can they be? - All killed the same way. - Well, I think that we can safely assume that some of the other side got badly hurt too. - I don't think so. I think it was one man. - Why do you think that? - Only one man's been attacked each time. If it was a gang, then they'd come for all of us. - Hmm. - Well then there's no problem. - But when he comes from me, he won't find me so easy. - Huh. Maybe. But I think you better cut down on the girls. Take it out. (fan clacks) (dramatic music) (clattering) Hey! (knife whooshes) (clinking) - Get back! (all laugh) (sighs) - If I can have one clear side, then I can get him. But the trouble is we haven't the faintest idea who he is. (dramatic music) (soft music) - Customer! - I don't think I've seen you here before. Have a seat. If it's your first time, I don't suppose you know the girls. I'll introduce them. (chuckles) Come with me. (women laughing and chattering) - Hey, look, someone's just come in. - You sit here. - Oh, he's cut, isn't he? - Yes. (laughs) Hey, look at him. (all giggling) (soft music) - Come and say hello Well this is Miss Hing Ling. And Miss Chu Wan. And Miss Yow Ying. Do you like them? - Mm. - Here's Miss Du Chang. And Miss Hung Lun And Miss Nay Da. - Hello. - Which one? - Mm-mm. (gasps) Pure angel, aye? - Hey. Hmm? Well I oughta say, you're hard to please. I show you nice girls and you don't like any of them. - Uh. When I came in, there was a girl here. - Ah. You got very sharp eyes. But still, she's an odd girl. - What way? - Bad tempered. - I want her. - Call Fung-hsiang down here. - Tell Fung-hsiang to come down! - You got any news yet? - Yes, I've got something to tell you. - Well, speak up then. Come on. Let's here what you got to say. - I've been checking around the burnt house. There's no doubt the two women were killed, and there was a man's body in the ashes. There's just one thing. It wasn't Chiang's body. (glasses shatter) - Hmm, so that's it, huh? - Black Fan messed up the job. - Well, at least we know who we're looking for. It's gotta be that fella Chiang. Go and call all the men together. - Right. - Start looking for him. Check everywhere. You're can turn this area upside down, but you've got to find that man. - Right. We'll get him. - I want that man, dead or alive. - Sure. - Fill out, everybody. - Right. - Come on, let's go. (men chattering) Wait here. Come on, everybody! Come on! - What now? - Make up two groups. One group takes the night shift and the other group takes the day shift. - Oh. - Huh. I'll get him. (dramatic music) - All right. That's all settled. - Yes, but be careful. (hand bangs) - All right! Dammit! I've had enough! Huh! - What this? What's all this noise about? You don't sound as though you're enjoying yourself. - Well, I'm not! What do you expect with this dummy here? - (chuckles) Well you can't say that I didn't warn you. She just bad tempered. (coins slam) - You can go. I'll see you later. - Right. (scoffs) - Hey, hey, now wait. Don't go just yet. There's lots of others. (gasps) (dramatic music) (door closes) That stupid bitch! - Just be careful. Watch your step. He's in a terrible mood. He's coming. (grunts) - Bring me some food and a bottle of wine! And tell I'm stupid girl to come down! - Hmm, people always say the customer's always right, but I had my doubts about you. Most of the time, you're way off. Hmm. (yawns) (groans) - Uh. All right. Come and sit down here. Pour the wine. (sighs) Uh? Drink up. Huh? Drink up. (chuckles) (laughs) I'm must say, you've changed a bit. Does that mean you're settling down here? Are you still mad at me? - Just making the best of it as I'm stuck here. - (laughs) That's showing some sense. Ah, good. (laughs) I'm very pleased. This calls for a drink. All right? Drink up. It looks like being a good night. Uh, not drinking? Go on. - It's a bit strong. I'll get drunk. - There's nothing wrong with being drunk. It always gives a nice rosy glow to everything. (laughs) (coughs) Here. Eat up. Eat up. - Mm. - Hmm. - Hmm. (glass clinks) - What do you two want? Just get the hell out of here. - Right. - Huh. (giggles) Huh. - Mm. (drink pours) Right. Drink up. - No. - Uh, drink up. Come on now. Come on. - You've got very strong arms. - (laughs) They're not the only strong thing I've got. - I couldn't believe it when you broke that rope with your wrists the other night. It must be a trick. - Uh? A trick, huh? - Why not? It could have been. I wouldn't know. - Huh! Get me a rope and I'll prove it. - Mm. (dramatic music) - Now tie my wrists as tight as you like. (chuckles) (drink splashes) (grunting) (door slams) (intense music) You bitch! - I'm Chiang Tai-kang. I understand you're looking for me.

Huh. The fool! I already told him several times to get rid of the girl. (hand slams) Let's have some light! - Just wait, wait til he comes. I'll kill him! I'll tear him to pieces. - Hmm. Hmm. I know one thing, somebody will die tonight. (dramatic music) What time is sun up? - Usually about five. - Mm. - Huh! I can hardly wait. I'll break his neck!

There's so much that I wanna say. - I know, I feel the same way. So much has happened, so much has changed. - But still, I'm sorry that it has to end like this. And it must. Have you noticed this guy who's been following me? Right behind me? - Ah, come on. All right now, you've had enough time. We gotta get to the court - He's a provincial court deputy. They got me booked for nine major offenses. That's including seven murders. - Well you should have left retribution to the law. To the law! To the law! To the law! To the law! (dramatic music)
