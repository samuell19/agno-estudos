- You ever been down south to Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi? - Never been that way before. - You ever seen Helen Keller's house? - Helen Keller's house? - Yeah, you ever seen it? - No, can't say I have. - Neither has she. - Not bad. - Run, run! Go, go, go! - Don't stop, don't stop! - They're trailing us, don't stop! - Oh my God, don't stop, run! - Bill. - It's Pete, but that works. - Fuckin' demon! - I'll be. What do you reckon they're doin'? - I don't know. Let's go get 'em. - Let's do it. - Jesus fuck, huh! - What in the hell done happened here? Sheriff, where's the other one? Where's the girl? - I don't know but that ain't right. - That looks like Taco Bell. - Jesus. Lopez, get us close to the house. - Sir, we're right over them. If I get any closer, they're gonna hear it. - Zinmen, zoom in and resolve. - Zoomin' in. - Oh my God, it looks like they were mangled by some kind of animal. Does anybody see any dogs? - Zinmen, launch those other two drones. Find 'em. - Launching now. - Lieutenant Carr, Lieutenant Carr? Lieutenant Carr? Lieutenant Carr! I'm Commander Jacobs. - I gave up my bars a long time ago, sir. - Lieutenant, how would you feel about getting out of here? - You got some C4? - I got a deal. - I'd rather take the C4. - Would you be so kind as to fetch the Lieutenant here some aspirin? He sure could use some. Oh, you are a drowning man. - Oh, and what does that make you? - The son of a bitch with a life raft. You're caught in some evil currents, and you'll be dead in a year. - Is that a fact? - Yeah. Evil always destroys itself in the end. - What is this, a fucking intervention? - It's a job offer. - Well, I'm not lookin' for a second chance. - The Navy doesn't give 'em. Jack County, Texas. You ever heard of it? - Nope. - I'm not surprised. It's barely a shit stain on the ass of Texas. But there is a little town there with a big problem. Men are being slaughtered, and young women are being kidnapped. Daily, it seems. - Really? How many? - Dozens, hundreds maybe. We're not really sure. Most local authorities have been killed, so, you know, the rest are too scared to talk. - So call in the Feds. - People are dying, Lieutenant, and you can help. - Are the cartels killin' 'em? - This is where it gets complicated. There are local legends of paranormal activity in Jack County. - What, like ghosts? - Like demons. - Are you serious, sir? With all due respect, fuck you. As you can see, I'm sleepin' off a hangover here, and I don't have time-- - Demons, and we think that they are responsible. - Demons or not, this has already gotta be all over the news. - Well, they're targeting a small population. Majority of 'em are Mexican immigrants. Down there another dead illegal isn't news, it's a victory. - Why do you care so much about this? - Well, we don't really, but we can't have this thing spread. Because if it is real, and as bizarre as it sounds, it just, the threat needs to be contained and neutralized. - You wanna throw me in the meat grinder? So, that being said, this must be a black operation. - No support, no backup, and undercover. If your identity gets out while you're on the job, then the DOD will deny any knowledge of your employment. You know the deal. - Who else knows about this? - A few others at Langley, and of course the Pentagon. - How many of these things are we up against? - No idea. - If I do this, I've got a couple conditions. - Within reason, I'm sure we can accommodate. - Fuck it. Let's go. - You okay over there? - Yeah, sure. - Hey, uh, you mind helpin' a guy out? - With what? - Well, it seems like, uh, whoever stocks this thing doesn't do a very good job, let's just say that. - Here ya go. - Thank you. - Don't sweat it. - Hey, hurry up! - I'm comin', damn it! - Excuse me. Meet me out back. - Hurry up, up, up! - We gotta leave immediately. - Let me get my bag. - Hold on, you don't know the whole story yet. - Since when did old Whiskey Sauce give a fuck? - Well, since never, but you need to listen up. - Listen nothin'. - We may not be up against humans. - Humans, babies, hamsters, it's all the same to me. - Fuckin' possible paranormal shit. - Then I'll be a motherfuckin' ghost buster. - You believe in God, Whisk? - Shit. - 'Cause that's what we're up against. If these things exist, is half-god, half-man. - Well, you know I believe in God. You know that. But I can't fight no gods. But I'm a God-fearing man. God fearing. - Demons, Whisk. That's what's got this town. - Ain't no motherfuckin' demons. A bunch of redneck, lynchin', meth smokers maybe. - Yeah. But the Bible says there are demons. - Yeah. Jesus visited a town, Gergesenes, saved a man possessed by demons. But in the flesh, man, uh, we all got our own demons. You should know that. - Yeah. And Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" - And they replied, "Legion, for we are many." You've learned a thing or two, haven't you? - Let's go save a town. - Let's save a town from some motherfucking demons. - Come on. - Oh, fuck me. Pull up, man. This is bullshit. - What's bullshit? - Did y'all know y'all were fuckin' comin' to get me? - Yes. - Huh? - Yeah. - Fuck. Y'all couldn't have gotten a bigger truck or vehicle or somethin'? They don't issue trucks no more? Man, I can't even put my fuckin' feet down. - Do you need me to move up? - Nah, nah, it ain't gonna help. My foot's already in your ass. You know what I mean? - Then fuckin' suffer in silence, bitch. - Oh, now I gotta be a bitch. I'm just sayin', man, how far are we? - You could always be back in there fuckin' scrubbin' shitters. - Okay, I like this better than that, but still. - How the fuck did you wind up there anyway? - You look like you need a bath, cocksucker. - Yeah, well, I've been workin' on my black face. Gonna join me the NAACP. See, I figure a little grease on my face, some watermelon, I'll fit right in with you, brother. - Til you take those pants off, and then they gonna all know the truth. - Yes, they will, Whiskey Sauce. Yes, they will! - What's up, Red? - Ah, it's good to see you, brother. It's good to see you. - Sir. - How you doin', Red? - None of that Red shit. - Yeah, by the looks of that chin, it should be white. - I just go by Ander now. - Ander? Fair enough. Looks like you're doin' really well for yourself here, Ander. Real good actually. - I'm doin' all right. Who's the suit? - That's Commander Jacobs. - Damn, sir, hot as balls out here. Got ya wearin' your monkey suit. So clearly the brotherhood's all here. - Didn't know you had company, baby. - Thanks, baby. - There ya go. - Y'all got mouths. Use 'em, why ya here? - I've got a proposition for you. - Oh, I just bet you do. One last mission. - You know, I had my last mission. I don't need another one. - Well, this one's different. This one will top 'em all. - Yeah, and I've never heard that before. - Look, I need you on this. I wouldn't be here otherwise. This is an opportunity for a new start, for me to make things right. - Well, I don't need a fresh start. Look, I'm done, guys. I did my time, I got out for a reason. I'm stayin' out. - Nobody's askin' ya back in. Hell, nobody will let you back in. This is for us. - Us? - Yes, us. - What, 'cause Bear, Lopez, they weren't available? - At least take a look at the file. - Demons? - That's what they're saying down in Texas. - Oh, I would love to see the op order on this one. - It'll be all plain clothes, undercover. - So what is your cover? - That's the thing. It's our call. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - What do ya say, Ander? - Call me Red. - They're in. You owe me 50 bucks. - I need a fill up on the bikes outside. - Where ya headed? - Jack County. - What's your business there? - Don't worry about it. I'll take, uh, three of these. - You don't wanna step foot on that land, mister. Ain't nothin' there to protect you. - Why do I need protectin'? - God left those parts a long time ago. What's left ain't fit for no man. - Keep the change. - IDs, let me see some IDs! Come on. You know, things can turn real difficult real fast. - Hey, we ain't done nothin' wrong. - Your mirror. - What about it? - It's broken. - Hey! - Hey! Y'all just calm down and have a good night. And get this fixed. - Officer. - Howdy. - Well, there's no sense in wastin' time. Red, grab us some rooms. I'm gonna head over next door and check out the locals. - You got it. - All right, well meet back at 23:00. - You want something? - Yeah, I'll take a beer. - A beer. So, where are you from? - Look, hon, unless this is a speed dating service, I ain't lookin' to chat. - Hmph, 3.50. - That's what I thought. Keep the change. - Yeah, thanks. You like what you see? - To be honest, she looks bored. - Well, new girls, they never know how to work it. It doesn't matter how big the room, or how many high rollers. They're all pigs. You have a cock, and I, and two dynamite titties. I can work them so good, the fuckin' king of Espania will oink and drop down his diamonds in my G-string. That's how it's done. No, no, no, save your money for the main event.

You don't get a free one. - Come on, baby. I need you. - Fuck off, Rafa, I'm not a fucking hooker. - I didn't say you were.

All that gunfire, no response. Either there's no one left alive, or they're too damn scared. Agent Barnes, you awake back there? - Yes, sir. - Make an anonymous call to the sheriff's office. Get 'em over there. Maybe one of 'em is still alive. - Still nothing. - Ivanova, there are more things in the Heaven and Earth than dreamt in all your philosophy. - Sir? - Yes, there's a chance. - The battery life's at 48%, sir. If we put a recon unit on the ground, we can get all the intel that we need. - Not enough time, Ping. All right, Lopez, let's get her out of there. Find a thermal, climb to 500 feet. - Sir, I understand you want to ascend, but this particular UV is-- - Agent, 500 feet, please. - Ascending 500 feet. - Turbos off, and we're gliding. - All right, Lopez, start your turns. - Yes, sir. Nothing, sir. - Wait, right there. Right here, you got that? - Yes, sir. - All right, how many sites are we connected to? - Nine. - All right, switch servers, have all 911 calls routed through us. Let's do it now, folks. - Let's get him on the bar, on the bar! Get some rags. - We gotta stop the bleeding! Go, go, go, get him on there! - Come on, I got you. Let's get you on top. Over there. - Yeah, you're gonna be all right, man. - All right, just relax. Where Rafa, Rafa! - Danny! - Come on stay with us, homes, stay with us. Stay with us, homie, come on.

Let's go. - Fuck! - Fuckin' motherfucker. Fuck! - Is this a joke? Does she smell like Eve before she bit the apple? Her flesh has been seduced and no longer pure. These mistakes, your stupidity is hindering us from our rise. Now, we can't let such temptation go to waste, can we? - Somethin' broke? - Nah, I just felt like wrenchin'. - Couldn't sleep either, could ya? - Could you with Commander Snore-A-Lot in there? Take this fuckin' wrench and shove it in his eye socket. - Something's got this town spooked, man. - What, there's a party and old Whiskey wasn't invited? - Nothin' like that, Whisk. Just thinkin' of ways to kill ya, so I can get some rack time. - Let's move. - Door, the door! Get her inside, get her inside! Go! - He sees us. - Yeah. - Could somebody get me a cup of real coffee, please? Not of that ass-sweat, decaf bullshit that you assholes make. Thank you. - Zinmen, get us closer. - We're at 22% now, sir. If we get any lower, we're not gonna be able to make it back. - Your coffee, sir. - Right, ascending 200 feet, 300 feet, 400 feet. - We lost power. Battery's gone. - It's done. - We can put astronauts into outer space, the moon, shit, probably even one day other Earths and other galaxies on other universes, so, please, tell me, why can't we use millions of dollars of sophisticated fuckin' equipment to clearly track and monitor these fucking things? Fuck! Why? Anybody? - Sir, I've got some of those old books. The Vatican librarian had them scanned. They're coming in now. - Oh, fuck. - Well, well, look who's back. - Fuck. Ah, what happened? - You got your ass kicked. - Where's Red? - Fire watch. - Who's the girl? - They've been in here praying all night, riding it out. - What's so special about night? - Excuse me, my son. I heard your question and thought perhaps I might be of some assistance. - Always, Father. - I'm Father Rodriguez, and these women are here because it is unsafe for them to remain in their own homes at night. - Safety in numbers. - Safety in geography. In Jack County, young women are prey, and here in this sanctuary, they are safe from their predators. The devil hunts at night. - So he, uh, they hunt women? - Not all women, just those who have reached womanhood, but have not yet known a man. - So they're killing virgins? - Their purity is of tremendous value. - Why? - Centuries ago when Lucifer fell, he fell in these parts, and his seed was buried deep within the soil of this place. What kept him at bay was the religious fervor of the people and they power they derived from a series of blessed artifacts housed in churches. Over time, these artifacts and churches have been systematically destroyed. Only one remains, a single one. This, this is the last blessed artifact. In here it's the only thing that stands between us and the demons. - So what's stopping them? - So long as this stands, they cannot enter without purifying themselves first. To do this requires a sacrifice. Virgin blood. - Only demons can destroy that thing? But in order for them to get at it, they have to purify themselves with virgins' blood? - Precisely, my son. And I am its guardian, the last defender of the faith. - Father,. What the hell are you people doing here? Father, what are they doing here? Look at them, this is a safe place with children. Get out! Father, get them out of here. - Mom. - What does she mean, "you people"? - It's okay, Angelina. It's okay, I'm here, sweetie, just sleep, okay? It's okay. - Sister Juana, these men are our friends. - With all due respect, Father, these men are most definitely not our friends. They are bar brawlers and nothing more. - They are angels. - Hell's Angels, maybe. - They're here to assist. - Assist? Look at them, they're bleeding, and from what? Did you ever think of that, Father? - From a terrific battle with them, and they survived. These men are deserving of our compassion and our respect. They fought them, Sister, them. And he, the big one, he saved little Angelina's life. - What? - He saved her life. - When? - Just now. I saw it with my own eyes. They need our care. Please, help them. - For you. - Sit still, let me fix your head. - Yeah, good luck with that. - Did you really fight with them? - Somewhat. Did you know 'em? - Well, like I said, small town, everybody knows everybody. They rode into town a few months ago. The prime suspects, a group of riders from down south. Came in one night causing all sorts of trouble. Then they rode out. We never saw them again, not until the girls started disappearing. - Fuck. Take it easy, will ya? - Hold still, you big baby. - How old is she? - 17 in a few weeks. I can hardly believe it. - She looks just like you. - Thank you. - You never fucking listen. - Are you okay? - Yes, just a bit hungry. - I'm sure your mom has something for you. - Are you scared of them? - No. Are you? - No, not anymore. I have you to protect me. - I think I found something. - All right, show me. - Malleus Maleficarum 1487. - Heinrich Kramer. - Now, apparently, according to this, religious artifacts. - Yeah? - Are repellent to demons. - Which is why they didn't go in. They came. - Right. - It's a church. - Right. Now, look at this. This cross is important. See, now the area used to have dozens of blessed crucifixes just like this. - Mm-hmm. - But over the years they've been lost or stolen. - Hmm, what is it about this thing that makes it so special? - We made it through another night. How do you feel? - My stomach hurts a little. - You're probably hungry. What happened? - Help me. - Jesus. - Where was she? - Pancho found her on the street. - Father, I think she's trying to say something. - What is it, Mina? - I saw them. - What, are you sure, where? - The factory. - What? Oh my God. - What the fuck are they doing here? - Rafa, it's okay. - How is she? - They others, they still might be alive, Carmelita and Maria. - What, where? - The factory. - Then let's do this. We've been waitin' by too long, lettin' these diablos kill our sisters and our daughters, too long. Let's get 'em back. - Wait. Wait. - Don't tell me to wait, Jefe. - Nobody tells Pancho to fucking wait. - You know, I was sleepin' off a hangover in a nice one bedroom loft when me and my team got drawn into this shit. I'm Lieutenant Warren Carr. This is Petty Officer First Class Greg Jackson, and Senior Chief Petty Officer Alexander Michaels. We're with a Navy SEAL team. Our mission was to covertly neutralize the threat that's assaulting your town. Problem is we had no idea who or what we were up against. Moving forward, I think it's best that we have the blessings and the support of the local town leadership. Wouldn't you agree? Good. 'Cause if you wanna get out of this alive, you can either listen up and help us out, or you can stay the fuck out of our way. - Okay, Rambo. Show a Jefe how. - Come with me. The building's guarded by three cops, one at each entrance. There's five cop cars out back. - So there must be more. - Yeah, maybe. - How many? - Well, it's impossible to tell, and we don't have the proper support to get eyes on this guy, so. - I've been there before to the south side door is a loading dock. - Is there anything else? - Yeah, the basement. The door's right here. - We'll sweep around this way. Red and Whisk will go with you to clear here. Red take south, and we'll take east. You ghost us, and I'm gonna put two in your chest and one through your throat. We clear? Good. - I just gotta say it. I got a bad feeling about this one. - Yeah, why don't you keep that shit to yourself? - Shut the fuck up, Whisk. - I'm just sayin' somethin' ain't right. Look, there's some bad juju on this. - Feel the same? - Look, this ain't the mission. We're supposed to recon, assess, neutralize, not hook up with fuckin' American me over there. Look, we've all seen these things. We can't kill 'em. Shit, we didn't even make a dent in 'em. We go in there, we probably ain't comin' out. - Yeah, maybe. But I ain't quittin'. I ain't ringin' that fuckin' bell. That clear? - Okay. So tell me, why is it always virgins with these guys? - Everyone's got a right to get home. - Fine, watch my six. Don't let me fuckin' get killed, sir. - When this is over, we definitely gotta get a beer, 'cause this is some heavy shit. - Jesus, shut the fuck up, Whisk. - Do I frighten you, Sheriff? - Uh, yeah. - Why? - I don't, I don't rightly know. - We share a common enemy. You have failed me. - Yes, yes, you're absolutely right. - Do you fear God as much as you fear me? - As an American, I believe in one nation under God, and yes, I am a God-fearing man. - Has it ever occurred to you to ask where is he in all of this? - No, I, I reckon not. - I am the one, the one that punishes sin. For I am here in the flesh. Call your God. If there is someone greater than myself, show me, introduce us. I am most eager to say hello. - Come here. - Gentlemen, what you're looking for is, other room. - I'm gonna kill all of them. - I ain't going to fight you, believe me. - Where are they? Where the fuck are they? - You're already too late. When they got the blood of 12, tonight. - Who, huh, who? - Right under their noses. It's, it's. - Hey! Hey! Hey,! - Get him off! - Let me go, let me go, let me go, all right, all right, all right. Fuck this. - Go with them, Whisk. Would somebody mind to explain to me what happened to our targets? - Hey, hold up. - What? Where the fuck are they, man? - Incoming. - Go on, get the girl, take her to the church. - Well what about these cocksuckers right here? You know what I'm sayin'? Where the fuck are you goin'? What the fuck? - We'll take care of this. We got it. We got it. - Let's go. - Moving? - Yes, sir. - How much time til we get new eyes in the sky? - I contacted ops, so probably an hour or so. Sorry about before. - Right, no worries. - Sir. - Jacobs. - How the boys doing? - Well, they're still alive. Can't promise for how long though. I mean, without air support or ground support, it's kind of hard for them to do their mission. Kind of a fool's errand. - Well this is all I can do without attracting too much attention. Too many people will ask too many questions. - Yeah, right. Well, I'll tell ya what. Jake, why don't you tell your liberal fuck friends back in Washington they're about to lose millions of dollars 'cause they won't give me what I need to properly take care of our boys. - What do you suggest? - What do I suggest, Commander? They need help, they need backup. They are in a shit storm. What do I suggest? Hey, Ping? - Yes, sir. - How long to get the QRF team at the station inserted? - Three hours. - Three hours. - HALO drop? - Yes, sir. - Bingo. - I'll get the Pentagon. - Barnes already has them on line. Good to see you doing your job, Commander. - Juana! Juana! - What? - We gotta get your daughter to the church. - Here, put this on. - Mama, I don't feel good. - I know, I know, but we gotta hurry, - Why do we have to be-- - Shh. - Go to the chapel. - Red, start lockin' down all the fuckin' entrances and exits. You fuckin' stick your, keep your eye on the fuckin' chicks. - Lieutenant Carr. - Who the fuck are you guys? - We're here to save your sorry asses, so I'd appreciate some gratitude. - Who ordered this? - Control. Where do you want this? Go for Catfish. - Tell those motherfuckers to get us the fuck out of here. - Roger that, we'll extract to PZ one. Let's move. - Hey, what about them? - Looks like you bit off more than you could chew. Sorry, but we've got another mission. I suggest you neutralize this threat, neutralize it quickly. Pop those red flares. - You just gonna leave this fucking people here? - Look, I admire what you're tryin' to do, but we have another mission to handle. We don't have room for them. Let's move. - What's your mission? What's your mission? What the fuck do you mean you don't have room for 'em? Whisk, I need you to go keep your eye on that priest. All right? I don't know where the fuck he's at, and I don't know what the fuck he's doin'. - Let her go! LT, do something! - Guns down. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, it's okay. It's gonna be okay. - I'm fixin' to take this here pretty little prize to whatever that thing is over yonder. - Easy, man. - Arms up, boy. - Easy, easy, easy. - Hey, look, they're gonna kill you when they're done with you anyway. Or I could kill you know, if you'd like. - Mr. Tough Guy. Well, well, well, Mr. Tough Guy, them there folks over there's gonna give me a big ol' heap of coin, so when this here's over, I can buy me someone as tough as you, Blackie. Imagine that. Good ol' Miller, proud owner of a big ol' dumb nig-- - Angelina! - Hey! - No, no, that won't be necessary, they, they can't come in. - I'm not takin' any chances, Father. - Hey! - Every little bit helps. - Help, Father, do something! - They're from God. We must stop resisting their will. - Let them watch! I want them to watch this. - Holy shit. Commander, we have to put an end to this now. - How do you mean, sir? - Agent Barnes. - Sir? - Would you get me the Secretary, please? - Yes, sir. - You think you can make a phone call and make all this disappear? My job is to keep this country safe. The death of one drunk ex-doorkicker is not my concern. - That drunk ex-doorkicker saved my life when you were just a shit stain in your mommy's drawers, so please, a little respect. - Sir, got him. - Mr. Secretary. Yeah, we have a situation. Yes, sir. - Control, this is Zulu Six, I am in the air. Package is on the way. - One minute to impact. - I've already won. - I. Abort, abort. - Control, this is Zulu Six, in range, target locked, payload is armed. - Contact, contact. - What do we got? - Confirmed visual on LT. - Zulu Six, Zulu Six, this is Control. Be advised, aborting, two, two, three, niner, five, copy. - Roger that, Control, weapons deactivated. Mission aborted. - I'll take care of the girl. Just make sure his body gets home.
