- Hi. Okay. Oh. You ready to go home? ♪ Hush little baby ♪ ♪ Don't say a word ♪ It's okay. ♪ Mamma's gonna buy you a mockingbird ♪ You're finally a daddy, babe. - She's beautiful. - I told you all it took was faith. - You ready? - She's meant to be ours. - Let's get out of here. - Yeah, let's go. Oh, I love you baby. We're gonna take such good care of you. - You know what, I never would have been able to buy this house if it wasn't for you. - You're the one that brought me the script. The studio's really happy with your work. Now Matt's show is not being received well by everyone and you know I've had to fight for it and you know how I hate to go out on the limb for him. - Yeah, I know, but I have faith in my husband. I think the show's gonna do really well. - Well I hope so. - Hey listen, I want to show you something. - Okay. - I mean I'm not supposed to tell anyone yet but, - No. - Yes. - Our Aubrey is preggers. (cheers and applause) - Right as you're about to go into the six month production, why didn't you tell me? - Well, we weren't supposed to tell anyone until after we saw the doctor. - Okay, I need details. How far along? Obstetrician. - Well, I'm 10 weeks, and Dr. Flickman in Burbank. - Did you even try to call my OBGYN? - Of course, but she's not taking any new patients. - Dr. Barnson is the best. I'm gonna have to get you in because no friend of mine is going to see some Dr. Frickman in Burbank. I'm be right back. I want to hear all the details. - I thought you didn't want kids. - Well, Aubrey did. - No one's gonna cut any slack. If our show doesn't rate, we're all out on the street. - Then I guess it's back to rent control. Hi. (dramatic music) - I'm sorry, do I know you? - I think if we had met, I would definitely remember. - You just remind me of someone. I can't place it. Sorry. - Have a nice day. - [Woman] You too. - Hi, I am looking for my wife. She's... Oh, she's right over there. - You're late. - Oh my god, traffic was a nightmare. You sure you don't want to stick with Flickman? It's like five minutes down the street from our house. - Babe. - The doctor will be with you in just a moment. - [Aubrey] Thank you. - Hey babe, you want to do it before the doctor gets in? (laughter) - Matt, come on the baby might hear you. - Come on. How about a little pre-check? Oh dammit. - Do you have to be on your phone right now? - It's just Vicky. - Yeah. Could you just be a little more present for this. You know it's a big moment. - I'm right here. I couldn't be more present. - Uh, not really. You could put your phone away. - I have enough pressures without more problems Aubrey. - My pregnancy is not a problem Matt. - That is not... (knock on the door) (dramatic music) - Well hello again. - [Matt] Hello again. - What, you two know each other? - Just downstairs in the lobby. - She thought I was someone else. - Actually, I said that you look familiar. It'll come to me. I'm Dr. Barnson. - Aubrey Lewis. - It's nice to meet you. Alright Aubrey, I see that your last period was April third. - Uh huh. - Okay, you should be closing in on week 12. So, let's take a look. - Oh, okay. Oh, by the way, we don't want to know the sex of the baby. - Alright. I like surprises also. A little pressure. Alright. Let's meet baby. I know who you remind me of. My father. There it is. - No. Wow. - [Child] Daddy's home. - [Mom] Hey baby. - [Dad] Who's my little princess? - Me. - [Mom] And I'm the queen. - [Dad] I love you so much. - [Child] Love you too daddy. - [Mom] Alright, dinner's ready, come on. - [Child] Okay. - [Woman] Jimmy. - [Man] Jimmy, get down. (screams) (sirens) - Mom. Who's my little princess? - [Man] Natalie. I love you. - [Natalie] Daddy. Daddy. - My baby. - [Natalie] Dammit. - What's wrong doctor? - The damn IVF failed again. Got my period. - Well maybe now you should try the natural way. You know, find a man, and then get... - Finding a man isn't the problem. - You know, you sure are miserable for someone who got everything he ever wanted. That looks great. - This thing is a piece of crap, just like my show is. - Hey. - Babe, I just never saw myself writing a family sitcom. I still want to care about something. - Okay, well, care about being a dad. You're gonna be a great dad. - I do care about that, alright. Just, not sure if I'm ready for it, that's all. - Okay, come on, no one's ever ready to be a parent. You kind of just have to go with the flow, you know. (phone rings) Hello? Hi Dr. Barnson. Okay, Natalie. Tomorrow. Yeah. Sure, what time? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Alright, I'll see you then. - What is it? - She said one of the test I took was inconclusive so she wants me to come in and redo it, so. - I'm sure it's gonna be alright. - Yeah. - Thanks for coming in at such short notice. Like I said, everything looks perfectly normal, it's just there was a problem with the lab, so. Unfortunately, we have to redo your pap. - Okay. - Alright. Little cold, sorry. There we go. All done. Alright. - Thanks. - You can get dressed. - [Matt] Hi babe. - Hi. - [Matt] Where are you? - I'm back here. - What a day. Oh, hello. - Hi. Am I getting stretchmarks? - Babe, you're not even showing. - You didn't even look. - Should we do it? - Definitely. - Will it hurt the baby? - I don't know. Should we ask him? - Don't say things like that. You're gonna spoil the mood. - Okay, I wouldn't do that. (soft music) (dramatic music) Oh my god, Matt. Matt, we got bleeds. Oh god, call the doctor, okay. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna call. I'm calling. I'm calling. - Oh no. Oh. God. - Could sex have caused the bleeding? - It's possible. I take it you had sex last night. - Would you two mind waiting here? I'll be right back. You can get dressed. (soft music) - My friend Nicole had a miscarriage and she hasn't been able to conceive since. - Babe, that's not gonna happen. You're gonna be fine. - Okay, first and foremost, the baby looks great. However, at this point of gestation, there's a higher risk for preterm labor when the cervical length is less than 25 milliliters. Aubrey, yours is at 19. Here. This is Aubrey's uterus in statural view. You can see that the cervical length is shortened. That gives us a strong indication that Aubrey you're developing what's known as an incompetent cervix. - Oh, great. My cervix is a bumbling idiot. - Cervical competence isn't something that's routinely checked unless there's been a history of preterm pregnancies, or some trauma to the cervix, like a, a lead procedure, or a comb biopsy. Now, with this recent episode of cramping and bleeding, I thought we should take a look. And I'm glad we did. - Okay, so what does that mean for the baby? - Well, we want it healthy and full term, right. - Uh huh. - Well, then we're gonna have to take some serious measures. I want to get you started on progesterone and I want to see you weekly so I can measure your cervix. - [Aubrey] Yeah, sure, whatever it takes. - Good. I'm glad you feel that way because I don't think you're gonna like the next part. We need to put Aubrey on bedrest. - Sure, but what does being on your back for the next five months gonna do the help? - It's going to keep Aubrey horizontal. We don't want the cervix contracting or you could go into preterm labor. Now that doesn't mean you can't get up for short periods of time to stretch or to use the restroom. But, unfortunately, anything more than 30 minutes could be damaging. We want this baby to cook as long as possible, right. - [Aubrey] Of course. - Oh, and, there's just one more thing. No sex, of any kind. And, I'm sorry, but that means no orgasms either, at least for Aubrey. - [Matt] Sure, of course. Not a problem. - Good. I'll see you next week. (dramatic music) - I don't think I can do a six month term in here. - What about work? - They said I could work remotely for now. Hey, is this your show? - [Matt] Yes it is. They're airing the pilot tonight. They're having a big party down at Mulligan's. The whole crew is down there. - Wanna go? - No. No, no, no, no. I can't bear to be in a room full of silence when it's supposed to be a comedy. - Stop. - [Woman On TV] We're a family. (laughter) Time's up. - [Man] Natalie, your name is naturally Kala. These are your real parents. - [Woman] We're finally going to be a family again. Is it my fault you haven't touched me in in I don't know how long. - [Man] Oh, yeah, well not long enough. - [Woman] You're a piece of ..., you know that? - [Man] Yeah, I'm a little piece of... - [Woman] Don't you walk away from me. (dramatic music) - Hey princess. - [Young Natalie] Stop. No, no. (screams) - Hey lady. Got any change? A hundred. (somber music) (phone rings) - San Quintin. (laughter) - Very funny. I was just calling to ask how you're doing. - Pretty good, but the housekeeper failed - Are you kidding me? She didn't show up last time either. God. I gotta get you some good help. Thank god she's not on auto pay, right. - Hey, do you have to go to the gym tonight? - I haven't been in a while, so I could. - Okay. Can you pick me up Chinese food later? - [Matt] Sweet and sour pork? - Chicken. - Yes, yes. Yes, chicken. The pork's for me. - Okay, well I love you babe. I'll see you later. - [Matt] Love you too babe. - Okay bye. - Bye. (dramatic music) - Hi Mr. Lewis. - Matt, actually. Fancy seeing you here. - Oh, yeah, I just joined. - Oh. - You like working out here? - Aubrey likes me to work out here. She's afraid I'm gonna get writer's belly. - I think you look great. - Well, in reality, I hate the gym. - Yeah, you and me both. - Doesn't look like it. - Well, looks can be deceiving. - [Matt] That they can. - How are you Matt? How are you doing? - I don't know. No one's asked me that in a very long time. All the questions are about Aubrey and the baby and never about Matt. And that sounded extremely selfish. - Well actually I think it sounded honest. - I don't know. - I like honest people. Matt, you know pregnancy is a time where relationships change. Things are bound to be different from the time it was just the two of you. You know, it's normal to feel overwhelmed. - No, is it normal for your wife to go off the pill without telling you? Is that normal? - Unplanned, huh? That's interesting. - As a matter of fact, she told the news the exact day I found out I was being promoted to executive producer on Family Phun, so. - Big fan by the way. - Yeah? At the end of the day I guess she got everything she wanted out of it you know. New house, new money, new baby. - What about you? Did you get everything you wanted? - I haven't figured that out yet. - I got to go. Mrs. Reedy's in labor. Twins. See, life could be worse. See you around. - Yep. Janelle? - Shocked to see me? - Well, I'm shocked to see you cleaning something, that's for sure. What are you doing here? - Aubrey said she needed my help, and our father called and laid it on thick. So here I am. Happy to help. Doing my best. - How much are we paying you? - Not enough for your BS. - You're using grout cleaner, not glass cleaner. It's gonna streak. - Thank you Matt. So helpful. - [Matt] Come on, seriously? - What? - You know very well that your sister cannot stand me. - Babe, you said I needed help, and she needs a job, so. - Yeah, but I figured that we would hire a real nanny, not, - Come on, a nanny's for kids. - [Matt] Okay. - Okay, I need help. - Fine. I know, but can it be anyone other than Janelle? - Okay, fine. Well if you want to quit, you know, and take care of me that's fine. We could snuggle all day. We'd be broke, just like old times. - They were good times. - So how was work? - Work was work. You know, I'm thinking about writing a whole storyline where tiger mom gets knocked up. - Oh yeah? Let me guess, she goes on bedrest? - Yes. (laughter) She's the only one in the family who knows how to cook and she runs the family restaurant. That is a huge setup for some serious comedic dilemma. - Oh yeah, yeah, serious. - It is. I hate writing sitcoms. Yeah, Megan thinks that I should hire a consultant for the pregnancy part. So I was thinking about that doctor, the new one. Benson. - Barnson. - Barnson. - Come on, you think she'd have time for that? - Well, she said she liked the show. - When? - The office. - While she was just, you know, finding the baby. She's like oh hey - I don't remember exactly, - I love your sitcom - Specifically when it happened. I just remember that she said it. - Okay, well I'm so pregnant that I don't care. (soft music) (vibrating) Love you. - Love you. (slow suspenseful music) - Yeah, I think the storyline is really smart. Alpha female breaks through the glass ceiling only to find herself pregnant the day they open the restaurant. I think it'll really resonate. - Yeah? - Yeah. I do. - Thanks. - [Woman] Matt, Aubrey's on line two. - Just tell her that I'll call her right back. - [Woman] You got it. - Thanks. - Why am I here Matt? - You're here as a consultant on pregnancies, and getting compensated rather well, I might add. - I don't need your money. - Okay. - You know, it's not unusual for men to fear childbirth, especially if it's their first one. They're afraid of how their lives may be altered, how they're perceived, will women ever find them attractive again. So their mind starts to wonder, maybe one last fling will be okay. - Hi. - Table read? - Yes, I know, five minutes. - Great. (chuckles) - So here are those notes on procreation A to Z. Call me if you have any questions. - Will do. Thanks, thanks again. (knock on door) - Oh hi. Who are you? - I'm Janelle. Who are you? - I'm Dr. Barnson. Can I come in? - Come in I guess. - Oh my gosh, hi. I wow, what a surprise, a doctor who makes house calls. - Oh yes, I always try to drop in on all my bedrest patients. - Wow, you look amazing by the way. I mean so beautiful. - You're sweet. And very pretty too. Oh I, I got this for you. - House calls and gifts. - It's just a little something. Here. It's good for the baby, and good for mommy. - Well that's really, really nice of you. - Did you want me to defrost the chicken, or? - Yeah that would be great. And also if you could just take the sheets out of the dryer and fold them while they're still hot the way I showed you then, - Sure. - [Aubrey] Thanks. - I see you got yourself some help. - Yeah, it's my sister. I mean she and Matt don't really get along, but she, you know, she's been super helpful. - Well, good for you. - Yeah. - I've seen some husbands build up a lot of resentment when they have to take up all that slack themselves, especially when they have demanding careers. It's important for a woman to know her role in the relationship, especially when there are so may options. Like that neighbor of yours. Yes, I saw him. How could you miss him? What is he like 16? - No, oh god no. I think he's, you know, 19 at least, college age for sure. But yeah, he's not hard to look at. - Well, you just remember the rules. You don't want to get too hot. - Matt's told me that you're doing some consulting on the show. - Well I gave him a binder with some information. That's all, no big deal. - Well I think it is. - Yeah? - Yeah, you're, you know, show already feels a lot more real. - That's good. - Yeah. That's great. That's what Matt wants, you know, more reality, less fluff. - Right. Well, I, I'm glad I'm able to give him what he wants. Anyway, I, I should go. I look forward to seeing you next week for your appointment. Bye. - Homework first. - But I don't have any homework. (chuckles) - It's so stupid. - Oh, Natalie came over today. - Natalie? - Uh huh. Dr. Barnson. - Oh. - She said she stops in on all of her bed rest patients. - Well that's nice. - Yeah, so nice. Do you think she's pretty? No, I mean, beautiful. She's beautiful right. - Oh come on. I've never taken you for the insecure type. Besides you know that you are always the prettiest girl in the room. - I think I'd be friends with her in real life. She even got me a Bluetooth speaker for the baby and it plays soothing sounds. - That's really cool. That was sweet of her. - I know. - Nothing but the best for my wife, right. (laughter) Yeah, come here. - No orgasms though. - Not for you. (laughter) (hissing) - Shhh, hey, it's okay. Shhh, hey. Shhh, hey. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Let's take a look. Just a little pressure. (heavy breathing) - You okay? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm good. - Hi. You said you wanted to talk? What's? Hey, can you... - I said I need to see you. (dramatic music) - I can't. (dramatic music) - What are you doing here? - I saw you with that man. I hope you're not in any kind of relationship. He looked just like that sick man that kidnapped you. - Oh would you shut up. Haven't I sent you enough money to keep you out of my life? - Your father died a week ago and you didn't even call me. - My father died when I was eight years old. - Oh stop it. That mongrel was not your father. You got to stop that nonsense or, I'm gonna tell the patients the truth about you. - You're gonna expose my truth, my truth? What about Frank's sick molesting truth mother, huh? - Oh enough. - Or the fact that you stood up for him for 10 years. Huh, how about that truth. You're still standing up for him. - I tried. I really tried. - Turning a blind eye is hardly trying. - I'm staying at the Quiet Neck Motel. He left a few things to you. - Burn them. - I'm here for three days. What are you doing here? (suspenseful music) - It's too realistic. It's a situational comedy, not a lesson in preterm labor. - It's edgy and fresh. The comedy is there. The network is just not seeing it. - Rewrite by 9:00 a.m. or we're both done. - Fine. (slow suspenseful music) Damn. Hello. I'm here. Natalie. Natalie. - [Natalie] In here. - This is... (slow suspenseful music) (doorbell) Oh no. - She came to see me at work. My father died a few weeks ago. Are you sure it's a suicide? - Oh yeah. Hung herself with a towel in the bathroom. - Where is she? - At the morgue, downtown. - Okay, I'll make arrangements with the funeral home. - Like I said, really sorry. - [Natalie] Thank you Detective Goodwin. - [Detective] Have a good evening. - [Natalie] You too. - What was that about? - Oh, a patient killed herself. - What? I'm so sorry. That's horrible, I... (slow suspenseful music) I really have to... - I really have to return a favor. - Didn't realize you were home. - [Matt] Oh yep, I am. - How'd the meeting go? - Oh you know, it went fine. Just a meeting. I decided I'm gonna stick with my old agent, you know. He's been there with me since the beginning, so. - That's good. I was just surprised, you know that you didn't say hi to me. You just jumped right in the shower. It's kind of weird. - I know I'm sorry babe, it's just been a really long day. But I'm home now. And I love you. - I love you too. (slow suspenseful music) (phone ringing) - [Natalie] Busy boy. - Well I would think the same about you. - Well, never to return calls to people I care about. - That wasn't me the other night. - Well maybe it wasn't who you want to be. - [Matt] Exactly. - Right. Yeah, I know Matt. I know you. Meet me for coffee. - Natalie, it... - [Natalie] Come on, I've got some notes for you. - Email them. Okay, just email them. (soft music) - Hey. - Hey. - How are you? I come bearing gifts. - Oh gosh, thank you. So sweet. I've been eating like a cow lately. It's the only thing I have to look forward to. - Oh, come on, you have the baby, you have Matt. Oh, by the way, his hard work is really paying off. I am loving the pregnancy arch. The finale, well that got kicked back, but, - Yeah, I heard. By the way, it was a really great idea you had bringing on Dr. Barnson as a consultant. - Oh I wish I could take credit, but it was Matt's idea and it is a good one. I mean the show's numbers are up. Makes me very happy, and more importantly, it makes the network happy. No, no, no, no. Here honey. Hormones on aisle three. - I'm okay. I'm just, I'm a mess. - You know, look, I know how tough this incompetent cervix thing is. It's just, it's really bad luck. - What if it's not bad luck? - What are you talking about? - I've been carrying this around for weeks now and you can't say anything okay. - Okay. - Okay. When Matt and I were first married, when we got pregnant, and I, I obviously didn't have the baby, I, I had a miscarriage. And I was reading online that if you had a miscarriage and you could have this thing that's called an incompetent cervix. I just, what if I'm never gonna be a mom. I mean, what if something happens and, I named the first baby Theodore after my grandfather. And, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't... (dramatic music) What the hell? What is she doing? (phone rings) Are you following me? - I own you. - [Matt] No, no. - Sorry, I'd love to chat, but I'm late for a baby shower. - This is crazy. - [Neighbor] Who's that? - That's my sister's doctor. - What the hell are you doing here, huh? - What? - Listen, I might not be able to stop you from being Aubrey's doctor, but showing up to her baby shower, that's just cruel. - Oh, there's nothing cruel about celebrating a life. (inaudible) Come on. - I'll tell you one thing, I will take hemorrhoids over postpartum depression any day. - Oh, my sister had post and prenatal depression. - What? - Oh don't worry. It'll all be worth it in the end. - Yah huh huh. Yeah, easy for you guys to say. You're not the one who's pregnant. - Oh Natalie, hi. Great to see you. - Hi. - Let me take this for you honey. - Thank you. - Oh my god, what did you get them. - Oh it's a little much. But then again, so am I. Oh wow, look at you. You look lovely. - Oh, I look like a pig. - No, no, no, no. You're glowing. - So I'm fascinated. Why gynecology? - Why not. I've always been interested in the process of life. Why a TV producer? - Oh, because there is just nothing more rewarding than my shows changing someone's life for good. - Oh, come on. - It's for the glitz and the glamor. - Yeah right, that's more like it. You know, I've actually been thinking of an interesting pregnancy complication for the show. - Really, well, what is it? - Well, you know how Matt wants things to be more real, right. Well let's just say everything is going smoothly with the pregnancy, right up until delivery. Mother needs an emergency c-section, and during the procedure, an artery is accidentally cut. Doctor has to choose between baby and momma. Doctor chooses baby. - It's a sitcom. - Well today's audiences are sophisticated. I'm sure they can handle a little blood. - And, the killing of the main character? - Matt is a terrific writer. He could easily come up with a replacement mother for the family. - You're a hoot. I never realized you were so funny. (nervous laughter) Gather around everyone. So this game is called name that baby. Now, in each balloon, there's a slip of paper with your choice of babies names. And in one balloon, Aubrey put the correct answer. So, ready, and go. - Oops. - Okay, I have Alison or Steve. - No. - [Woman] Henry and June. Say this one is pervy. (laughter) - I'll have to remember that in case we ever get pregnant with twins. - Well this one just has a boy's name on it. Theodore. (dramatic music) Is everything okay? - Yeah, yeah, I just, I'll be right back. - Okay, Vicky, well I'm sure I will see you again soon. - Oh well, hopefully sooner rather than later. - Hey, are you having an affair with my brother in law? - Um, that's ridiculous, not to mention totally inappropriate. - They practically came together and then Matt sped off. - Oh you saw Matt and I in the same car together? - You arrived at the same time. - Look, I'm sorry if you got the wrong impression, but not only would it be completely unethical, and like Vicky said, extremely inappropriate to do anything near your accusations, I would never be attracted to someone like Matt. - And why is that? - Because I'm a lesbian dear. (dramatic music) (slow suspenseful music) - Natalie. Natalie. Natalie. - You're just in time. Dinner's ready. I knew you would come back. - Excuse me. No. No. - What? - How dare you record a video of us having sex without me knowing, and then you have the nerve to show up to my wife's baby shower acting like nothing happened. - You have sex with your wife's obstetrician and act like nothing's happened. - One time Natalie. One time. - Yeah, you say that a lot. You say that a lot. - You better delete that video and do it now or I swear to god. - What? What are you gonna do? You gonna change doctors? Hmm? - You're sick. - Change doctors, you'll see how sick I really am. Are you sure I can't convince you to stay for dinner? - Positive. (slow suspenseful music) You sure it's okay to be up? - Yeah, I'm tired of eating in bed. What's wrong? Worried about the season finale? Hey, I read the script. It's great. - No, it's not great. - Okay, well if I say that it's cute, you'll bite my ear off. - Well if you say that it's cute, I know that you really mean it sucks. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - , I cannot wait til it's just you and I here again. - And the baby. - Of course and the baby. Dammit. Do you mind not doing that? You scared the crap out of me. - Well you scare me too Matt. - What? - I know you're having an affair with my sister's gynecologist. - Have you lost your mind? - You can deny it all you want, but I know. (phone rings) - Chri... - Don't answer that. She doesn't deserve it. - It's Vicky. - You know, I know something's up. And I know it's that woman. I can't tell my sister because of the stress and the potential harm it could do the baby but, I am gonna tell you this, whatever is going on, you have to end it. Now. - The only thing happening right now is I am missing an important business call so if you don't mind, Janelle. - Not at all. (slow suspenseful music) Definitely need to get these couches steamed. It's starting to look like somebody's been mud wrestling on them. And, oh crap. We want to get the floors polished. And, that's all for now. Just get the notes emailed to me. Hey. - Hey. - If anybody shows up here asking for me, you tell them I went to lunch, alright? And I mean anybody. - You got it boss. - Hi. - Hello. - I'm here to see Matt. - Matt is not in the office. - I had an appointment with him. - But he's gone for lunch. - Would you please let him know that Natalie is waiting for him. - When I see him, I will. (slow suspenseful music) - No, I like it. I think it's good. No, it's okay, really. - Oh Natalie, hi. Do you have a second? - Uh huh. I don't know how Aubrey lets Matt have you as a best friend. You are so beautiful. - And so gay. (laughter) - Still. I don't think I could do it. Do you think Matt would make a good father? - That's the last thing that I’m thinking about right now. - More wine? - Sure. Wow. That's pretty wild. - This? - It's a fertility statue from the 1890s. Up until the middle ages, women weren't allowed to give birth indoors. - Thank you. - They had to go to the woods, or By a stream. It was just her and the midwife. And the midwife had to be an older woman who already had a child of her own. - And why was that? - Maybe they thought that she would steal the baby. - Oh. That's intense. So what about you? - What about me? Do I want to steal a baby? (laughter) - Do you want to have a baby? - Not tonight. - Seriously? I'd like to know. - I can't have children. - Oh. I'm sorry, I, - Yeah, see, that's exactly what I didn't want. I, I, I hate pity. I really, really hate it. - No, I'm sorry. That was too personal. - Why are you here Vicky? - Cause you invited me. - No, I think you're here because you wonder if Matt ever hit on me. - What? - That's what I think. I think the very thought of that turns you on. (dramatic music) Does that turn you on? Huh? Does it? - That's disgusting. - Your precious little Matt didn't need that much coercing. (screams) (slow suspenseful music) (phone rings) - Matt Lewis. - You're best friend is dead. - What's going on? Did we get canceled? - I just found out Vicky's dead. - [Natalie] Tell me if this is uncomfortable. - No, it's, it's fine. - Good. You know it's sad to know that I was one of the last to talk to Vicky. - How do you know? - Oh, the police told me. They had some questions for me. They have no idea who did it. - Are you serious? You saw them together, in the parking lot? Natalie and Vicky, the day that Vicky died. - A bit of good news, your cervix hasn't dilated any further. I'll give you a call when the results of your GBS swab are in. You can get dressed. - They left together? No, I didn't know that. I didn't tell that to the detectives. This is the first I've heard of it. - Just switch those two around. Ms. Lewis, would you like to schedule an appointment for next week? - Okay, thanks. Thanks, Kieth. I'll see you on set later, thanks. Okay. Bye. (slow suspenseful music) - Look, I know that you think that bedrest is making me crazy, okay, and it is, but I just, I don't understand when did Natalie and Vicky become friends? You know what she told me in that exam? She told me that the cops questioned her last night because she was the last person to speak to Vicky. I mean come on, that's weird, right? - I have to show you something. - What is this? Your idea of a belated birthday gift. - No. Check it out. Please. - Cara. But that's Natalie. - I got it out of Natalie's trash. - What? Why were you in Natalie's trash? - Because I don't trust her. - You know what, there's a number on the letterhead, I'm just gonna call it. I can't do this anymore. - What are you going to say? - I don't know, but I'm just, I'm done wondering what the heck is going on. - Okay. Put it on speaker so I can hear. - [Man On Phone] Dr. Patterson's office. - Yes, hi. May I please speak to someone about Cara or her mother if she's available. - [Man On Phone] May I ask who's calling? - Just a friend from college. - [Man On Phone] Please hold. - [Doctor] This is Dr. Patterson. Look, I don't speak to anyone about Cara or Natalie, or whatever she's calling herself these days. There's plenty to read about Stockholm syndrome and Cara's abduction online, so please don't call again. - Abduction? - Damn. - Do you have your laptop? - Yeah, it's at home. - Okay, let's go. - Check please. - Come on. - [Secretary] Yes Dr. Barnson. - How long until the Internet's back up? - [Secretary] They said it could be a while. - What? That's ridiculous. - Whoa, wait, scroll back up. That one. Hours after giving birth, the new mother experienced every parent's worst nightmare when her newborn baby girl was abducted from Jefferson Hospital. - No way. - Though it's a happy ending to a terribly sad story, there's likely a long road ahead for little Cara and her parents. Wait, click on the photo. Oh my god. Look at her eyes. That's definitely Natalie. - I knew there was something wrong with her. - Whoa, wait, stop. - That looks exactly like Matt. - Oh my god. - Natalie. - Aubrey, I need to tell you something. - What? - I think there's something going on between Matt and Natalie. - What? - I followed Matt to Natalie's house. I think they're having an affair. - What? - Natalie, hey. - Hi. - What the hell are you up to? - What are you talking about? - One of my crew guys saw you at the studio, in the parking lot talking to Vicky the same day she was murdered. ... - How. Oh my god Janelle. How long have you known about this? - I don't, I mean... - Oh my god. - Listen. - So what, I was looking for you, I bumped into Vicky. Where's the crime in that? - Oh, come on. Did you have something to do with Vicky's murder? I wouldn't put it past you. You are crazy. - Oh my god. - I don't know for sure, but I wasn't going to tell you unless I knew for. - Oh my god, I'm such an idiot. - And I feel like, you're not an idiot. He is the idiot. Nat is the idiot. - Oh god. - What happened, what's wrong? What's happening? - Oh god. I think my water broke. - I'm gonna call Nat. - Call 911. - Okay, okay. I'm going to. - You are insane. I would not put that past you, this whole thing. - I think you're, - This is all your, you're just so crazy. - Just a little tired. - Ah. (dramatic music) - Oh Matt. What have you done? What have you done to us? (phone rings) Matt Lewis' office. Oh, hi Janelle. This is Matt's assistant. He's on set right now, can I take a message? Oh really. That's wonderful. Yes, I will be sure to tell him. Okay, thanks. Your wife's having your baby. (slow suspenseful music) - Ah, Dr. Flickman. I never should have left you. - And how are you doing? - I'm scared. - Well you should be. You're about to have a baby. Let's get you checked out. - Hey. Sorry, how is she doing? Like really. - Your sister's fine. She's doing great. We'll check back on her in a few minutes. - Okay, thanks. (dinging) (dramatic music) - Natalie? (dramatic music) Natalie. (dramatic music) ... Oh my god. - You are such a jerk Matt. You just disgust me. Who do you think you are? What are you doing here? What are you... - You talk too much. - We're at eight centimeters. Baby looks good. Of course it's too late to do an epidural. So I'm gonna need you to be tough, okay. Deep breaths. - Okay, thanks doctor. Oh baby. (slow suspenseful music) - Dr. Barnson. It's been a while. Your patient said you were unavailable. (slow suspenseful music) - Nobody ever makes a move on one of my patients. - Oh god. Ah. - Mrs. Lewis, how are you feeling hon? - Where is Dr. Flickman? - You know what, I'm gonna need you to stay calm. I'm gonna check a few things. Deep breaths. Focus on deep breaths. You got this. He's on his way. (slow suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - Where is Dr. Flickman? - Don't worry, the doctor's gonna be here shortly, okay. Now with each contraction, I need you to take a deep breath and push, are you ready? Alright deep breath, and push. One. (screaming) You got this. That is great. The head is coming down, just a few more pushes. Here we go. And push. Yes, one, two, three. Thank goodness doctor, you're just in time. - I see you're doing great. - She cannot deliver my baby. - Mrs. Lewis, I need you to calm down. - I cannot, I will not stay calm. Please, please just find my sister or my husband. Help me. - Nurse, would you please administer a dose of Versed and Fentanyl. - Help me. - Do it. - Help me please, help me. - Now. Mrs. Lewis, you are too far along to stop. - You won't take my baby. - Now you are going to have this baby whether you like it or not. - Doctor. Doctor, no. (screaming) - Help me. Help. No, no. Help. - Shhh. Relax. Relax. Now, I'm telling you one last time, as your doctor, push. - [Aubrey] No. - Alright, push. (screaming) (dramatic music) (screaming) - Yes, okay. Oh my god. (baby crying) (dramatic music) By the way, it's a girl, and she's perfect. - Excuse me, I need Aubrey Lewis' room. It's an emergency. I think it's labor. Hey, hey. - Get out of here. Get away from me. How could you? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay. - She's here. - Who? - Natalie is here. She's here. Go. - Where's Aubrey? What room? - It's 123, go. (slow suspenseful music) - Aubrey. What happened? Are you okay? - She has our baby. Natalie took our baby. Bring back our baby. - Someone help. Help in here. Get over here. You know Dr. Barnson? Dr. Barnson? She took our baby. Call security. I'll get her back. I'll get her back, okay. Call security. ♪ Hush little baby don't say a word, ♪ (chatter) (dramatic music) - Be careful, she's dangerous. ♪ Momma's gonna buy you a mockingbird ♪ ♪ And if that mockingbird ♪ - Natalie. Hey.

She didn't make it. - I don't believe you. - No, it's true. It's true, I swear. She's not strong like you are. She was never meant to be a mother like you are. She's not. - And what about you? What about you? You didn't even want this beautiful baby. - No, I didn't know what I wanted. - You didn't even want her. - I didn't know. I don't know what it means to be a father, but you showed me that. You showed me what it means to be a father. You did. Please, please, please. - Get back. Get back. (baby cries) - When I was at your house, I saw your nursery. It's beautiful. It's perfect. It's perfect for her. But you can't be a mother all alone. I can't be a father all alone. We can do this together, you and I, like a family, a real family. - [Dad] Natalie. I love you. (police chatter) - Let me hold her. Okay, just, I just want to hold her. Okay. - [Man] He's got a gun. - You took my family. We were a family. - [Man] Jimmy put the gun down. - You've destroyed that. All I wanted was for us to be left alone. Bye princess. - Daddy! (screams) - Hey princess. I love you. - I love you too daddy. (screams) (dramatic music) - It's okay. I'll get you to your momma. (dramatic music) - Hi. - She's fine. She's safe. - Thank you. - Careful. - Oh, she's beautiful. You're so beautiful. Hi. Hi. You're so beautiful. - Gonna miss you you little snuggle bug. I'm gonna miss you so much. Up. Watch, there we go, there we go. Hi. - Hi. - Here she is. The most beautiful girl in the world. Second most beautiful. Hey, I was thinking that maybe next time I might come for a visit, maybe we could, I don't know, you know, have dinner together as a family? - Yeah, I don't know. I don't know either Matt. - Okay. - Maybe. Maybe. (somber music)
