Just wait in line. I'll be right there! Hey, something's burning. Oh. Ow! Damn it. You know, my birthday isn't for another two months. I know that. I can make you pancakes if I want to. I'm good. Please don't do that. Uh-huh. Who's that? Have you seen my mug? The one with the sunflowers on it. Do you need money for school? I'm gonna be late. You should've gone for the pancakes. And given her the satisfaction? So when'd you start sleeping on the couch? No, I just keep on passing out in front of the TV. I mean, not that I blame you. Pretty shitty thing, what she did. Hey, hey. None of that. So, what, you getting into fights now? They were being assholes. That's no excuse. Look... I know things between your mom and me... Has nothing to do with this. So how'd the other kid look? The other two kids. One of them cried. Yeah? Hey, it's me. I didn't want to wake you earlier. There are pancakes... Is that why you're calling? Well, I also wanna talk. I already ate. I'll see you later. Greg... Are you fucking kidding me? Jesus Christ, Connor. Dr. Harper, your nine o'clock is here. Justin Whitter, 10 years old. Went missing on a bike ride last night near Troubadour Park. Park ranger found the bike, no boy. Just like Michael King? No, we don't know if the two are connected. Michael King was abducted cycling to a corner store in the city. Justin Whitter, local boy. Good home, respected family. He went missing on county lines, but as of nine o'clock this morning the case was ruled ours. Does Spitz know about this? It's up to him if he wants to get involved. He'll wanna get involved. I'll let you manage the situation as you see fit. You're lead on this. Got it. Connor? Connor? Whoa! Whoa. I'm just a window repairman. I'm not gonna hurt you. What are you doing here? Your husband called about a broken window. Just finished putting in a new one for you. Oh, my God. Okeydokey. Just give me a jingle if you have any problems with it, and have a good day. Thank you. I'm sorry, who let you in? That kid of yours. Very polite. You trained her well. - Who? - Yeah, John. No. And the truth is, anything you find could be important. Justin was last seen wearing a green soccer jersey and carrying... Gonna want answers, and fast. So the kid's riding his bike all alone through the woods. The parents are okay with that? He's 10. Figure he's old enough. How's the home life? You know, really. Mom, dad, two happy kids. Perfect all-American family. Yeah. Aren't they all? Lisa and I went through that rough patch last year. Hey, come on, Spitz. Look, I'm not saying I know anything. Just there was this counselor. Jackie is a counselor. Yeah. We'll be fine. There's something up here! All right, step away. What you got? Jesus Christ. Sir, should we bring it in? Yeah. Yeah, you can... You can bag it. Thanks, Kayla. Spitz. You okay? You remember Cole Gordon? It was before your time. Oh, of course I remember. The green knives. Six boys. All found buried with those knives. Yeah, I know. But Gordon, he's... Yeah, yeah, I helped put him there, and he ain't getting out. So what're you thinking? Could you pass the dressing? Thank you. Hey, did you let a repairman in today when I wasn't here? Jesus, Mom, is that who it was? Did you screw a repairman? Okay. Okay, you're angry. How could you do that? How could you do that to Dad? Who was it? Just someone, sweetie... Oh, you don't get to call me that. You don't ever get to call me that again. I see how mad you are. You don't get to act like nothing happened! You think pancakes and fancy dinners are gonna make it up? No, I don't... You ruined our family and you should fucking pay for it! ...the scene in Troubadour Park. Cheryl? Whitter is the second boy reported missing in the last month. Now, if you remember, nine-year-old Michael King went missing just... ...from his house. Authorities are now telling parents of young children to keep them close and well supervised at all times. Earlier in a press conference, the police chief said that he is confident... ...that those who are responsible... Oh, I didn't hear you pull in. I tried calling you a bunch. How was your day? You broke a window? I called and reported that repairman they sent out. I think he stole from us. You what? All of our silverware is completely gone. Look in the drawer. He said something strange about some girl who was helping... Why would he take our shitty silverware? I don't know, Greg, but it's not there. His boss is gonna look into it. I don't know what's wrong with you. So tell us a little bit about your son, Mrs. Whitter. His name is Justin. Justin Whitter. He's 10 years old. Um... He's very excited about starting fifth grade. He rides his bike all over this neighborhood all the time. So it's really normal for him to ride his bike home from school. Everybody in the neighborhood knows him. He's just a really great kid. Hey. How'd you get in here? Come here. Where are you going? Come on. Yeah, this is your room, but, no, not in there. Hey, come on. Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you. Connor? Connor, come on. You're hilarious, but let me out now. Connor? Connor, open the door! Open the door. I'm serious! Connor, open this door! Connor! What're you doing? What are you doing? I heard pounding, so I came up the... Where's Connor? He's out. What? Anything? No. Do you wanna call the station? You know, maybe I'm just tired. Why don't you sleep upstairs tonight? Yeah, I'm gonna move some stuff into the guest room. I know you can't just forgive me. I don't expect you to, I really don't. But I want you to know I'll do whatever it takes to make... Did you wanna get married? What? What do you mean? A shitty cop making shitty pay, this out-of-towner who your parents hated. My parents didn't hate you. Your dad hated me 'cause he knew I wouldn't provide for you like he did, like he did with this fucking house. I never needed you to provide for me. I never wanted that. I wanted that. You really think we'd still be together if you hadn't gotten pregnant? I'm glad things worked out the way they did. I'm trying, Greg. - What about the guy on top? - Watch it. Up there. - Eleven o'clock. - Yep. Covered. Don't shoot me in the face! I know, man, I'm covering you! Right there, right there, dude. What're you doing? Where were you? I was thirsty. It's a little late to be playing video games, isn't it? I'm taking you to school tomorrow. What? Why? Doesn't matter, I'm just taking you. I'm not gonna get kidnapped, Mom. Oh, my God, I haven't seen him in forever. Hippie. Remember him? No. Mom. Good night. Hello. Davis wants to see us. Now. Yeah, okay. I'll be right there. Sorry. What'd I miss? Cole Gordon. A closed case. I got pulled out of bed for this. You know why you're here, Spitz. The MO is an exact match of a serial child abductor you put away 15 years ago. I was on the phone with your old partner while you were all tucked up. They sent what they still had on hand. Jesus Christ. Put that shit away. Gordon's defense attorney's trying to use it to build a case for a mistrial. They didn't waste any time. I'm sorry to disappoint the dickhead lawyer, but Gordon was a convicted pedophile with a trunk packed full of those knives, not to mention clothes from half a dozen of the victims we found at his house. Yeah, well, it's probably a copycat. But we need to get in front of this. I sent Larson to track down the two boys that escaped, Braun and Travers. Oh, Jesus Christ. Yeah, it's been 15 years, but they might remember details now that could help impede Gordon's defense. I wasn't wrong. I interviewed both those boys extensively when it happened. There's no doubt. No doubt. Then why'd you end up with us, Ray? Get his address. But he went to prison. He's locked away. To the best of our knowledge he is, Mr. Braun. But we'd like to talk to your son, if that's possible. He's out back. Tommy. Tommy? There's some nice men here to see you. Tommy? Remember me? Officer Spitzky. It's been a long time, Tommy, but I still have that brontosaurus you gave me. Tommy? No, no, no, no, No, no, no, no! No! No! No! No! No! No! Hey, Tommy. Tommy? Can you start at the beginning for me? I need you to answer my questions, okay? I know you're scared. There was a man. A man? Someone you knew? No, but he said he knew us. Where did you see him? Watching us on the tracks. Did he do that to your face, Tommy? I did it to myself. After the little house in the trees. Is that where he took you? Do you think you can remember where it is? It's not there anymore. It's a magic house. It disappears. What does that mean? It means... you're never gonna find him. Hey. What are you doing here? I took the bus out this morning. I'm staying with a college buddy in Braxfield. Did you not get my messages? You cannot be here. My son is here. Well, let's go somewhere. Take the day off work. It's so good to see you. No, no, no, no. Did you not get my texts? Did I freak you out by what I said last time? No. Because that was a whole different... Because I'm in love with you! I'm in love with you, Jackie. I can't... I don't want to be with you. Jackie, listen. I know you're scared. Todd, stop! I'm scared too. But what we have, you know... Ow! Oh, my God. Ow. What the hell? Jesus. Let me see. No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine. I gotta sit down. No, no, come with me. Come with me. Okay. All right, honey. I'm good. Oh, my God. What the fuck? Oh, Jesus. Jackie. Careful. This reminds me of high school. Remember? Sneaking into your parents' basement all those times. Here we go. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? Okay. Ow. Whoa. Whoa. This is like... Come here. This kinda hurts a little bit. Come here. Oh, nice. This is great. Yeah. Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow. Be careful. Mom? Honey, you'd make an amazing nurse. Oh, ow! Fuck. Oh. As soon as Connor goes to school, I think I should take you to the hospital. Yeah, that sounds great. You're calling me. Where's your phone? What're you talking about? Where's your phone? Hello? Hello? Did you leave your phone somewhere? My phone. Did you turn this on? No. Were you just up on the roof? What? No, what're you talking about? You said you were taking me to school. I am. Is something wrong? Get in the car. I'll be right there. Connor, if you did something, if you were upset... What're you talking about? You can tell me. I won't be mad. I just want... Mom! Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Harper. No, Mrs. Whitter, I'm so sorry for your son... Has he heard anything? Your husband? I-I... I'm not sure. I know they're doing everything they can. My son is out there somewhere. They're gonna find him. Greg is going to find him. Yeah. Thanks. You think he knew him? What? Justin Whitter. Chances are he knew the kidnapper. Maybe. No, think about it. Kid's on his bike. Sees the perp. They know each other. So the kids stops. He grabs him, drops one of the knives to throw us off. Spitz? Maybe. Or... He stops the kid. Sorry it took so long, I didn't... Help me. Jesus Christ, Jackie. Walk me through what happened. Everything. We were talking. Just talking? Yes, we were talking by the side of the house. I explained that we were over, and out of nowhere it just fell. It was bleeding, but it wasn't like that. Why didn't you call an ambulance? Is there anyone you can call? Why didn't you call an ambulance? It was Connor. What? He was upstairs. He's been so angry. So angry. So angry he tried to kill someone. Maybe it was an accident? Jesus Christ, Jackie. I don't know what's happening... No, no! You don't get to lose it right now! Listen to me. Do you know... what will happen to our son? I won't be able to protect him. Go change out of those clothes. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Jackie! Drive straight to the hospital. Don't stop for anything. I'll call you when I'm on my way. I'll find him, Jackie! I'm gonna find the son of a bitch who did this. Drive. Spitz. 911 dispatch just got a call from someone claiming to have seen our kidnapper. No shit. Where? They're tracking GPS signal now. And Harper's not answering his cell. I can pick him up. Did you get that on camera? Yeah. I thought that wasn't gonna happen. I was so close. Hell yeah! Holy shit. You see this view? - Wow. - What? I don't think I've ever seen a view this nice before. Nobody deserves this. That's a fridge? What the hell? Hey, don't break anything. I wasn't planning on it. Oh, my God! They have "Battlestar"? Look at all that wine. Bet they're alcoholics. Jesus. They take so many pictures. Creepy mom. It just keeps going and going. It has, like, actual wings. They got you locked up. Alec! Hey, check it out. I found our room! Guest room, baby. This is the life. What the... These sheets are covered in, like, a layer of dust. It's a fucking sandstorm, Jesus. Do these people not have friends? Didn't you say we had to sleep somewhere out of sight? I did. Let me take you to our sleeping quarters. And at night... we are going to sleep in here. Ta-da. You gotta be fucking kidding me. I'm not. Okay. Okay. So, I should probably tell you a little bit about what we're doing. Um... So this is a documentary. Yeah. Um... It's to give you all a look at how a professional phrog goes about phrogging. They call us phrogs with a "P-H" because we hop from pad to pad undetected by the people who actually live in the house. Usually I try to stay in a place for no longer than, like, four or five days 'cause it makes it harder to be discovered. For the most part, I really try to disrupt their lives as little as possible. Oh, and it's a good thing that these people have a guest room. That's what you wanna look for. A room that is rarely used by the family that you can make headquarters. As you can see, I'm eating some of their food. Um, this is allowed because, you know, um... a girl's gotta eat. We just try not to take too much of one thing. You asshole! Alec! This disturbing creature is my cameraman, Alec. I can't believe you brought this creepy thing with you. What? It's fitting. We're phrogs. It's a frog. You're such a freak. He has never done this before, so I'm showing him the ropes while he documents with his nifty camera. Oh, I also let him pick out this house. And I sure know how to pick 'em, huh? So far, so good. This is the best part of the day. We get to be loud, and we have the house to ourselves and we can move about freely. But when they come home, we have to stick to our hiding places and stay quiet. And that part's gonna suck. Yep. So... It is ten minutes after 2:00 a.m. Alec and I fell asleep, and the family must've come home while we were passed out. Alec, are you awake? Alec? Alec? Alec? What the hell are you doing? I was bored. You can't just go outside whenever you want. He just got home. Who? The husband. Did he see you? Yeah, I mean, he saw me. He waved. Okay, very funny. Come on. Get back inside. Sweet dreams. And here we go. We're gonna be late. Hey, are you insane? You trying to set off a smoke alarm? Yes. Stay away from the window. God, who knew this phrogging thing would give you such a stick up your ass? Shh! Hushed voices. Sorry. Dude, I don't think you understand how dangerous this is. We could go to jail. We're breaking so many laws just by being here. I do understand. But isn't that part of the fun, almost getting caught? No, the fun is to not come close to getting caught. Wanna play the word game? What is it with you and that word game? Something to fucking do. Okay, you're the one who's been hounding me to come along. I was perfectly happy doing this alone. I know. I'm glad to. I just thought it would be a little more... less shit. It's better than... ...subways and park benches. Just about. Okay. I'm thinking of a... seven-letter word. It starts with a "B." Jesus Christ, Connor. Bastard. What? Seven-letter word, starts with "B." Mission accomplished. There's so many places to hide shit down there. If we need a quick escape, that's our route. Check it out. How'd you do that? Downloaded an app. They keep their Wi-Fi password next to the chore chart. You are such a freak. Wouldn't it be kinda funny to mess with them? Take some random shit, make them think they're going crazy? No. It wouldn't. Stop touching stuff, okay? Can you believe how loaded these people are? They have so much money, and this is the shit they decide to buy? The wife's some sort of doctor, I think. It was on her mail. Dr. "Stepford Wife." Shit. Hello? Someone call about a broken window? Just a second! Just let him in. He doesn't know you don't live here. Hi. I got a call about a broken window. Yeah, that was my dad. Uh, it's right this way. Alec! Come on! Now! I'm just a window repairman. I'm not gonna hurt you. What're you doing here? Your husband called about a broken window. Just finished putting in a new one. No more going downstairs. Ha-ha. Level 59. Suck it, asshole. This is so messed up. Another kid got swiped. Here, in this town. Justin Whitter. Ten years old. Oh, yeah, Justin. You know him? No, Mindy, I kinda stopped hanging out with ten-year-olds when I was, like, ten. Okay, yeah. Fucking hysterical. Dude, this is sad. "Last seen wearing a green soccer jersey. Went missing in Troubadour Park." Sucks for him. Yeah, it does. Here's your bottle. Okay. Thanks. Gotta stay hydrated. Thanks, Dad. ...the scene in Troubadour Park. Cheryl? Whitter is the second boy reported missing in the last month. He's just a really great kid. Come on. Yeah, this is your room, but, no, not in there. Hey, come on. Hey. Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you. Connor? Connor, come on. All right, you're hilarious, but let me out now. Connor, I'm serious. Open the door. Connor, open the door! Open the door! I'm serious. - Connor, open this door! - Greg? Connor! What're you doing? What are you doing? I heard pounding, so I came up the... Where's Connor? He's out. What? Alec! Alec! Get back inside right now! What if someone sees you? What happened to the bed? Husband pissed himself. Or so he thinks. What? Alec. Come on. You promised. You said that you would be cool. I'm not finished playing yet. Playing with what? No. No. That's not how this works. Okay? We don't mess with these people. We don't terrorize them. We coexist. Then what's the point? What's the point if we don't make them question their sanity a little? Honey, did I freak you out by what I said last time? I mean it. Come on, please. I don't want to be with you. Okeydokey. What the... What the hell? Let me see. No, no, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. I gotta sit down. No, no, no, Come with me. Come with me. What the fuck did you just do? Relax. It's a little bump. What is wrong with you? Nothing is wrong with me. Do you realize that they're gonna call the cops? No, they're not. We have to get out of here. Yeah, you do. What? What is going on? Why are you doing this, Alec? Okay, I brought you here because I trusted you. I know. And I'm sorry. But I'm having fun. I don't know what you're talking about. What's going on? Alec, I don't know what's happening. That's it. We're leaving right now. Okay. Okay. Shit. Our stuff is in the basement. Great plan. Well, it would've been. We need to figure out a way to get them out of the house or just distract them or something. He dropped his phone. Did you turn this on? No. Where you just up on the roof? What? No, what're you talking about? You said you were taking me to school. I am. Get in the car. I'll be right there. Knew it was in there. Good man. Holy shit. So sorry it took so long, I wasn't... Why didn't you call an ambulance? Is there anyone you can call? - Why didn't you call an ambulance? - It was Connor. - What? - He was upstairs. He's been so angry. So angry he tried to kill someone. Maybe it was an accident. I don't know what's happening. No, no! You don't get to lose it right now! Listen to me. Do you know... what will happen to our son? I won't be able to protect him. Alec? Get out. Don't look at me like that. You're insane. Please. I'm calling the cops. No, I am not going to let you ruin this for me. Get off me! Mindy? Mindy? Come on! Come on! Jackie! I'll call you when I'm on my way. I'm gonna find him, Jackie. I'm gonna find the son of a bitch who did this to Connor. Please work, please work, please work. 911, what's your emergency? Hi. Yeah, I need help. I think I'm with the kidnapper... of those boys. I just woke up in his car. Ma'am, what location? I don't know. Hello? We're in the woods somewhere. Stay on the line. We'll track you on the GPS. No, no. Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Hello? Hello? No, shit! Don't hang up. - Help us! - Help us, please! He said he's gonna kill us! Hurry! Hurry! Please, please hurry! He's digging a hole! Yeah. Please! I'm not gonna leave you. Hurry. Hurry, he's out there! Help us! Okay. I'm gonna get you out of here. No. No. It's gonna be okay. He's back. Didn't you say we had to sleep somewhere out of sight? I did. Let me take you to our sleeping quarters. And at night... Son of a bitch. Spitz. 911 dispatch just got a call from someone claiming to have seen our kidnapper. No shit. Where? Wake up. Wake up. Listen. Listen to me. Listen to me. What I need you to do... is stand up. Okay? Stand up. Okay? Just stand up. Stand up. Please... Please... You don't have to do this. Yes, I do. I know what you are. And what are you? Some kind of vigilante? I know you took those boys. No, you took those boys. You and your friend kidnapped those boys. Then you came here to terrorize the lead detective on the case. You tied up his son. He was gonna be next. I stopped you just in time. You shoot me, you're shooting a cop. You have any idea what's coming for you? Wait. Please... You don't understand. When I was a little boy... I don't give a fuck. Detective Spitzky?
