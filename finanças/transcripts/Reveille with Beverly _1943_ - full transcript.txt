Would you like to hear the whole album, Beverly? Oh, no, please. - Hello, Beverly. - Hello, Elmer. Say, I've been practicing that step you showed me. I think I got it down pretty good, watch. No, that's not quite right, Elmer, it's more like this. Oh, more taps, I think I see now. - Elmer! - Yes, Mr. Smith. Would you like to hear some more records, Beverly? I don't think I'd better, Mr. Smith. That boy's broken more records than Wirraway. Beverly, why don't you come back and work for me? I sure could use you. Oh, thanks a lot, Mr. Smith, but I'm really very happy at KFEL. You're still trying to get on the air, eh? Oh, yes, sir. I'm going to have my own program. O hot one with plenty of jive. Personally, I think the station plays too many classical records. - Some people like the classics. - Some people like spinach. Now for example, you take The Road to Mandalay. With my tires and 4 gallons of gas a week, nothing doing. Goodbye. Hello! Hello! Oh, she's away from that switchboard again. - Where is she? - I don't know, Mr. Kennedy. Well, don't just stand there, go find her! Go find her? Mr. Kennedy, I take dictation, I run that switchboard and... ...now you want me to be a magician. Mr. Kennedy, I can't do it, there's just some things that I... I don't want you to be a magician. And stop that... Oh, why should a man be worried with two such girls? One that's never here and the one who is here is a wack! Oh, no, they turned me down. Too skinny. All the red tape, oh, it's awful. Come back tomorrow, see this man, see that man, come in again the next day, I just couldn't stand that. Everything else is all wrong... I'm coming. KFEL, one moment, please. Hello, KFEL. One moment, please. Mr. Kennedy has been asking for you, Beverly. Oh, he always is. Can't I take an hour for lunch once in a while? That's your question. His was, "Where is that Beverly Ross?" Isn't she ever on the switchboard except on payday? He'll have more respect for me when I click with my radio ideas. Well, you'll have plenty of time to practice. Get in your stall. My advice to you is stay in it the rest of the day. As for me, I'd leave this place tonight if a knew a fellow that had his ABCs - ABCs? - Yeah, A-card, B-card and C-card. Oh, Elsie! KFEL. One moment, please. Beverly, if I get any calls, I'll be at home. - Going so soon? - So soon? I get up every morning at 4 o'clock to be here by 5:30. I do my broadcast and it's afternoon before I ever get out of here. Oh, I'm sick and tired of being an early-birder. I know how you feel, Mr. Lewis, but after all, you have your own program. But, gee, what I wouldn't give to have a chance like yours. This is your early morning announcer, Beverly Ross, wishing you a very happy day until tomorrow morning... ...when the clock again chimes 5:30. Young lady, I hope your dream never comes through. Unless you want indigestion, heartburn, chronic dyspepsia... I'd still be thrilled. Oh, I almost forgot. Yes, what? - I bought this for you to, um... ...make up for the one I broke. Oh, so you're the one who finished my Schubert's Unfinished Symphony. Yes, but I got a better one. Freddie Slack and his Boogie Best I beg your pardon? The Cow Cow Boogie. Freddie never grooved one that was better. Will you take this ghastly thing away? - You don't like Freddie Slack? - I don't like him and I don't dislike him. I don't know him. My program is Symphony at Dawn. Dew is on the grass, woodwinds, the white swans stretching their lazy wings, And there's going to be no boogie-woogie to contaminate it with a lot of Cow Cow stuff. And certainly not in slacks. - Oh... Oh, Mr. Lewis. - Yes? - Your fan mail has doubled today. - No! - You got two postcards instead of one. - Um... thank you. Dear Vernon Lewis, in the morning the air is fresh, clear and invigorating, You know, I never tire the thrill of reading... ...how my broadcasts brighten the dawn for my... many listeners. Yes, I know, I read them. You've been listening to Mr. Vernon Lewis, the early worm who gets the bird. Oh, Mr. Ryan, At Home With the Olivers has been changed to studio B. Thanks. KFEL. No, madam, Miss Bunty's Cooking Class is not on the air today. Miss Bunty's in the hospital with a severe case of tonane. You're welcome, ma'am. Now, take her out in the air, take her out in the air. Beverly, get the agency on the phone, we've got to get those actors right away. No, never mind, we haven't got time. We haven't got... - You! - Me? - Come on, let's go! Come on! - Oh! - Pa, so long. - Goodbye, darling. The phone! Maybe it's the boyfriend! Maybe it's an alert. - Hello? - Hello, Mom? - I'm going on the air. - Oh, you must be joking. Oh, it's what you've wanted for so long. - Who is it, Mom? - It's Beverly. Well, good luck, dear, and don't be nervous. Beverly's going on the air. - Eddie, Beverly's going on the air. - On the air? - Now. - Oh, good! - Tommy Hough phoned today, Laura Jean. - What did he want, Mother? Hello! Hello! Oh, she's away from that switchboard again. If I don't get this call through. - Shall I try to find her, Mr. Kennedy? - Oh, yes, Elsie, please do. Hello! Hello! Hello! Wait a minute, she's not at the switchboard! - Oh, I'm going to see what's the matter... - Never mind, I'll go see myself! Oh, I always get in trouble trying to help somebody... Look, she's not here. She's not here at all. - Get on that switchboard, Elsie. - Ooh... Oh... please get on the switchboard, Elsie. Thank you, Mr. Kennedy. You see, you can be nice. And Mr. Kennedy, I respect you as a big man. I'd like to have your picture, Mr. Kennedy. You see, I have a book at home that I paste pictures of big people. - And I'm just dying to paste you. - Thank you, Elsie. You're welcome. Get on that phone! And when that leaping gazelle Beverly gets here, you tell her to see me for a farewell look. KFEL. Oh... Oh, you don't tell me. Oh, you don't tell me. Oh, you don't tell me. - Oh... - Who was that? He didn't tell me. You cannot afford to miss one chapter of this popular Exotic Lotion serial. And speaking of Exotic Lotion, does wash day leave your hands rough and unsightly-looking? Listen to the way one housewife solved her wash-day hands problem. It was my husband who made me realize... ...that wash-day hands were threatening our marriage. That's Beverly now! But I patted my husband's cheek and said, "Darling, you need a shave." Fancy my embarrassment when he replied, "Sweetheart, I just did shave. It's the palm of your hand that has the whiskers." Right then I got the idea that I needed Exotic hand lotion. Some lotion and some lotion. So long, folks. Gotta keep them flying. Fine, Beverly, fine. - Oh, what are you doing here? - Starting my radio career. That ain't the way I heard it. The boss wants to see you right away. Oh... And furthermore, I'm getting sick and tired of paging you... ...every time I want to make a phone call. But I was only helping the Oliver family. They've gotten along without you for over 200 chapters. In fact, I can get along without you. You're through. Well, if that's the way you feel about it, there's nothing I can do. But before I sign off, there's one thing I've got to say. Some day you'll say, what a sap I was not to hold on to that girl. Because I've got real ideas for radio. You've told me your ideas over fifty times. "What we need are more jam sessions on the radio." Right? Right. And you'd be surprised how many people would go for it. I'm not gonna find it out. That's all. But won't you let me explain about what happened at the switchboard? What is there to explain? Just this. As the Olivers were going on the air, Mrs. Browning fainted. It was too late to replace her, so the director insisted that I read her lines. - Why didn't you tell me this before? - You wouldn't give me a chance. Alright, if you want to stay, take over the switchboard from twelve to eight. - Twelve to eight? - A.M., before I get up. Oh. - Good morning, Mr. Lewis. - Good morning, Beverly, good morning. - How was your broadcast? - Wonderful as usual. Just a minute... Oh, you must have picked up your mail already. Yes, I did, when I first came in. Say, Beverly, I'd like to make a little change... - Mr. Lewis! - What's the matter? - Oh... you look ill. - I look ill... - Oh, Mr. Lewis. Oh, don't faint! - Why, I'm not going... Don't faint! Oh... Oh! - I'll get you some water. - I don't want any water, I... - But you do, Mr. Lewis. - You're acting so silly... - You're ill, please sit down. - I don't want to sit down. - Here, drink this! - I don't want any water... Drink it! I told you I didn't want any water. What's happened to you, Mr. Lewis? - What's happened? - Oh, you're ill and don't know it. You know? You know, now that you've mentioned it, I... I haven't been feeling so well lately. Oh, Mr. Lewis, you've got to go away. Go to the mountains, or go fishing or something. No, no, no, it can't be done. Some fool once said, "The show must go on." Oh, but can't you find a substitute? You find one and I'll be up to my knees in creek water before you can say Tchaikovsky. Alright, Tchaikovsky. You're looking at your substitute right now. You are listening to KFEL... ...and this is Beverly Ross substituting for Mr. Vernon Lewis, bringing you an hour of early-bird recordings. I feel like a new broom this morning, so I'm going to sweep out the regular symphonic program... ...and start the day off with a sock. This is the beginning of Beverly's career. - Hi, want a lift, soldier? - Why, swell! Thanks. - Where to, soldier? - I'm on my way to camp. Well, this is a through train. Good, I was beginning to worry I'd be late for reveille. Do you mind if I turn the radio on? No, go ahead, help yourself. Here we go with Count Basie's recording of the One O'clock Jump. Hop to it, Count. If you liked that one, we've got a lot more. Hotter than your morning coffee. If you're lucky enough to have coffee. I bet she looks like my old maiden aunt. There's no way of telling whether you like my recordings or not because... ...I can't see your faces. And we can't see yours, sister, and we don't want to. Hey, soldier, do you mind if I get another station? - Oh, no. I thought the girl was okay. - So did I. And I'd venture to say she's better looking and younger than you think, boss. No old war horse would be playing jive at this time of the morning, sir. I'm still willing to bet she looks like my old Aunt Mathilda. If you're serious about that, sir, I'd be willing to risk a buck that she's quite a dish, and pretty. Well, if there were any way of proving it, Andrew, I'd take you up on it. - What do you think soldier? - Well, she's my... Oh, maybe you're both right. Well, thanks very much, fellows. - I'll just be in time for roll call. - Okay. Hey, you'll have to pull out of here. Oh, no, I've got a reservation here for room and board. - Oh, a letter of recommendation. - It is. Okay, but this is where you check your chauffeur. That's where you got me wrong, fellow. I got a reservation here too. Now wait a minute. No private cars allowed on the post. Now drive that heap over there and leave it. All right. Hey. I'm working for Uncle Sam now, carry your own bag. I guess we're both working for Uncle Sam. I'm sorry, Andrew, I forgot. And, um, cut out that Andrew stuff. From now on it's plain Andy, see? - Okay, Andy. - Thank you, sir. Now wait a minute. No more of that "sir" stuff. From now on it's plain Barry. Okay, Barry. Fresh customers. - First two bunks to your left. - Thanks. Hello, soldiers! Hey, look. Look who's here. I didn't expect to see you fellows so soon again. These are the two birds who gave me the lift. - No kidding. - Welcome to the Biltmore. - Thank you. - You see, the bellboy just went out... ...for his errands, however, I'll be more than happy to open the doors to your suite. Suite 16 and suite 17. - Thank you. - Thanks. It may take you some a little while to get used to the place, but... ...us old-timers will show you the ropes. - How long have you been here? - Monday will be a week. My name's Andy Adams and this is Barry Lang, he used to be my boss. But don't hold that against him. - How are you? - Hey, Eddie, Since you guys've already met, why don't you do the introducing? - Well, this is Tom McCoy. - The bandleader? That's me, in person. And this bruise is Private Puckett, better known as Canvassback. Hiya, fellas. Hey, didn't I see you fight the main bout in the Garden last year? - Yeah. - No, Canvassback's never been... ...in the main bout. In fact he's never seen one. - No? - You see, on account of his eyes... ...always close in the semi-final. Hey, what goes on? What is it, a fire drill? - Mess call. - How is the food here? Oh, terrible. for lunch today we're only gonna have soup, steak, baked potatoes, string beans, apple pie and coffee. You can't keep your strength up on that. - What, no ice-cream? - That's terrible! This is Beverly signing off until tomorrow morning at the same time. You guys still got that bet on as to what that dame looks like? Well, I hadn't given it a second thought, but I still got a buck says she's in her foolish forties. I still got a buck says she ain't. - You're a persistent guy, aren't you? - Why not? And what would be the use? There'd be no way of proving it. - Oh, yes, there is. - How. You come home with me this weekend. I imagine she'll be there. She's a very close friend of my sister's. - You mean you know her? - Too well, pal, too well. Hey, see the way Eddie talks? Looks like I'd win the bet hands down. - Hey, Lang and Adams, fall in. - Okay. Too bad Eddie had to get stuck with kitchen police. It'll seem kind of funny breezing into his home and introducing ourselves. I don't care who introduces us just as long as I win that bet. Ah, you haven't got a chance. With you I never have a chance where there's a babe concerned. Can I help it if I've got charm? Charm? Ha! Soldier, it's your bankroll. Look, Andy, I'm sick of hearing about my bankroll. Have I ever tried to buy my way out of any dirty work? No, but all the dames know you're of the Lang's chocolate millions. Why don't you try being a Mr. Average guy for a while, without any dough... and see where it gets you. Hey, I'll tell you what I'll do, wiseguy. If this Beverly is what you think she is, you be Barry Lang, you be Mr. Rich. And I'll be Andy Adams, your ex-chauffeur. - Are you on the level? - You're darn right. You'll get this idea of yours about being rich out of your head. Ha, ha, with your dough and my looks you won't stand a chance. - Hello. - Hello. - Won't you come in. - Thank you, thank you. - Where's Eddie? - Well he had a date at camp this weekend. - He's on K.P. - Who is it, Beverly? Friends of Eddie's. - Are you Beverly Ross? - That's my name. Come in and meet the rest of the family. Don't say I call my shots. - What do you think? - What? - Eddie's been promoted. - No! - He's a K.P. - No! This is my husband, Mr. Ross. - How are you, sir? - How do you do? - Oh, Mom... - And this is my daughter Beverly. - Hello. - I have another daughter Evelyn. - She works at a Defense class. - Is that so. - You're Beverly? - Yes. - Eddie's sister? - Yes. But... there are two Beverlies? Well, if sons can be named after their fathers, why can't daughters be named after their mothers? - Which is the one we hear on the radio? - I've got to plead guilty. I hope you're not going to hold it against me. I've often wondered how many listened to my daughter on the radio. Now I know, but this is one more than I expected. - Oh, Dad. - You're just as I pictured you. Oh, pardon me. I'm Barry Lang. And this is me... I mean, Andy Adams. You won't mind if I leave you. I've got to take the roast out. - Oh, not at all. - Don't forget to save the grease, Ma. Carrots, celery... um, lettuce. And, um... more lettuce. Well, this is quite a victory garden you've got here. It's Mom's. She knows how to raise things. - I'll say she does. - Shall we sit down? Why must a beautiful night like tonight turn into a horrible morning? Don't tell me you hate to get up. Do you like it, I mean, getting up so early just to broadcast? Oh, I love it. After all, it's a start in radio and that's what really counts. - Have you been in radio long? - Well, I'm only substituting, but... what I'd give to have a program of my own. You just wish hard enough, you'll get one. I'm afraid wishing isn't enough. Wishing is what keeps us have-nots going. You can't all be like my pal Barry... ...who's never had to struggle for a thing in his life. I'll bet everything he touches turns to gold. Yeah... Speaking of bets, would you like a confession? Well, if you want to give one. Well, when we first heard you on the radio, I got the cockeyed notion that you were... ...some old dame with a face that would stop a tank. Barry and I made a bet and... he said you were young and pretty so I paid off. Serves you right. I never paid a bet more gladly in my life. Well, I think I'd better be going. - Thank you for a wondeful evening. - You'll come again soon, won't you? - May I? - I want you to. - Andy! - What? Um... Andy's ready to leave, Barry! That's fine. My dear Beverly, after I left you last night, I had an idea. Since you're on the air between reveille and breakfast, why not play up to all the boys in camps all over the country? I'm sure it would start their day off just right. You can guess what it'll do for me. Would it be a bad idea if you called your program reveille? Hoping to see you again soon, I remain yours sincerely, Barry... Andy Adams. This is Station KFEL Good morning all you nice people... and a special good morning to all the boys in camp... ...who have just been blasted out of your beds by the bugler. I've just received a letter from a very dear friend of mine, Private Andy Adams. - Hey, that's you! - Yeah! And, folks, he suggests that I got to take this program to all the boys in camp... ...and call it Reveille. I think that's a grand idea. But Andy, do you mind if I add a little touch... - No! - Shh! ...and call it "Reveille with Beverly"? So to all of you the thousands of boys in service all over the country, I say a good, good morning. From no on this is your program and here's hoping you fellows like it. If you do, you can thank Private Andy Adams. Nice going, Andy. And you ain't narily bumping your gums there, bub. Being in the army isn't so bad when you have Bob Crosby to play for you before chow. So here he is with the best Dixieland band in the land, playing his own recording of Big Noise from Winnetka. This is for Andy, I hope he likes it. Thanks, Beverly. # Big noise blew in from Winnetka # # Stole each girlie's heart and then # # Big noise blew in from Winnetka # # Big noise blew right out again # # Girls were sighing # # Their boyfriends crying # # Their hearts were breaking when # # Big noise blew in from Winnetka # # Big noise blew right out again # # Big noise blew in from Winnetka # # Big noise blew right out again # And that's a sample of the kind of reveille you'll get with Beverly. Plenty of the old barrel house to get you rolling in the morning. - Time to get up, sir. - Huh? Your exercises are on the air in two minutes. Oh, yeah... the exercises. Exercises are a bore. I hope all you boys have enjoyed my jam session... ...equally as well as Symphony at Dawn, the program which was previously on at this hour over KFEL. But I have a feeling the majority of you prefer Freddy Slack to Beethoven, or Bob Crosby to Mendelssohn. Remember, Andy Adams gave me this bright idea. How do you feel about it, soldiers? Will you write in and let me know? Remember, tomorrow we celebrate my anniversary. I will have been on the air one week. So until tomorrow morning at reveille, this is Beverly saying, at ease, men. Trying to put something over on me! I'll tell that girl! - Hello, Mr. Smith. - Hello, Beverly. Um, Mr. Smith... - Could I have my job back? - Well now, Beverly, I... I don't know... - Elmer! - I'm sorry, Mr. Smith. Can you have your job back. Just put your hat in there and go right to work. Oh, thank you! - Elmer. - Yes, Mr. Smith? You're fired. Me? - What's all that? - Fan mail. Fan mail? It must be a month's accumulation. It all came this morning from soldiers. - Soldiers? - Yes. What is this, um... Reveille with Beverly program? Oh, it's one of our... huh? Why, it's terrific, whose idea was it? Oh, um... well, it was a little idea I whipped up myself. - Little idea? - Well... Lewis got sick, I had to have something quick to take his place... ...and I didn't want to bother my ideal men with such an early show, you know. Why, it's topped anything we've had on the air. Look at this mail, listen to this. "Dear Beverly, your program was grand. When a Scotsman spends one cent and expects no returns, you may be sure you are good. Signed, um... Private Angus MacPherson. - Angus MacPherson... - Yeah. Are all these letters for Reveille with Beverly? Why, that's nothing. Wait till you see the other loads. Congratulations. Ideas like this only come once in a lifetime. Yeah, that's right... just once in a lifetime. Elsie, get me Lamb, Curry and Rice. No, I'm not hungry! That's the name of our advertising firm, remember? She's as dumb as Beverly. Beverly! "N" as in... no coffee. - "O" as in... - What are you doing? I'm sending a telegram to Mr. Vernon Louis telling him to hurry home. Tell him to stay there for the duration. Tell him to stay there for the duration. Get me Lamb, and if you can't get me Lamb, get me Rice. And get Beverly. Get Beverly, get Lamb, get Rice, get Curry. Mr. Kennedy they're so hard to get I think they're all rationed. Hello? It's Mr. Lamb, do you want to take it, Mr. Kennedy? I'll take it right here. Hello? Hello, Lamb, oh have I got a great radio show for you. If you can't sell this to a sponsor, you'd better quit. - Yeah, you oughta quit. - Is it good? - Is it good? - It's gotten over 1.000 letters already. It's got over 5.000 letters already. Just a minute. Would you mind if I take this alone? - No, sir. - Thanks very much. Hello. Five-thirty. Yes, in the morning. Well get up! Better still don't go to bed. Goodbye. Hello? Beverly? Mr. Kennedy, it's Beverly, you want to take her? I'll take it here. Hello, Beverly, this is Mr. Kennedy. Say, Beverly, I was thinking of what happened this morning and I... I've decided to give you your job back. Well, thanks, Mr. Kennedy, but I'm not cut out to be a switchboard operator. Oh, no, no, I mean on the air with your own program, um... Um, Reveille with Beverly. At a substantial raise, of course. Oh, but... you said you didn't like swing. I said that? Now, you know the majority of our listeners prefer Freddie Slack to Beethoven... ...and Bob Crosby to Mendelssohn. Oh, but... what about Vernon Louis? Vernon Louis? By the time he gets back, we'll have television. And who can stand looking at that face? You will? You will come? Wonderful! Oh! Oh... Mr. Smith, I got my job back at the station! Isn't it wonderful? And, Mr. Smith, you know where my heart is, radio. And.. oh, well, gee, anybody in the world could do this job... and besides, you wouldn't be missing me very much anyway... Oh, thanks a lot, Mr. Smith, and goodbye, Mr. Smith. I know you'll understand, Mr. Smith. I'll make you proud of me yet, Mr. Smith. Oh, um... charge them. Charge them? Elmer, come on back to work. Hey, tell the colonel I'm having my breakfast in bed. Maybe he'd like to join me. Hey, Andy, turn on the radio, Beverly's on. Alright. Good morning, everybody. And a special good morning to all our boys in the Armed Forces. When I took that suggestion of Private Andy Adams', I really didn't know what I was letting myself in for. You can say that again. But you men have no idea what your letters did for me. And speaking of writing, your letters have been pouring in by the thousands. It's good to know that you all are with me. The cad! Why, I've been asked to settle bets, send photos, how much I weight, if I have a sweetheart of my own. And there are so many requests for numbers that I couldn't possibly play them all. However, digging in partially into my mail bag, I've come up with a request from sailor Franklin Delano Lincoln Van Buren Jones. He wants me to give him a Duke Ellington classic. Well, sailor, that's easy. I have one here with some fancy licks. It's the Duke's recording of Take the A Train. Hot dog! # Hurry, hurry, hurry # # Take the A train # # To get to Sugar Hill # # Way up in Harlem # # If you should take the A train # # You'll get to where you're going # # In a hurry # # Hurry, hurry, hurry # # Now it's coming # # Can't you hear the rails a-thrumming # # If you should miss the A train # # You'll miss the quickest way # # To get to Harlem # - Good morning, Maggie! - Good morning. I overslept, I almost didn't make it. Hey! It's almost time for your morning exercises, sir. Oh, yeah, thank you, Watson. Exercise. I want you to remember, your new master of ceremonies is Vernon Lewis. From now at Reveille, we're going to have little talks like this. It's Lewis! Watson, my clothes! The studio door was locked and... ...there was Mr. Lewis inside sticking his tongue out at me. I wish you'd tell him where he gets off. I wish you'd tell her where she gets off. You were just pinch-hitting for me. I might have been pinch-hitting, but I got to first base. Now, please, I'm sure this whole matter can be settled very easily, Vernon. - We'll give you another program. - A new program? Why, my symphony-adoring fans would rebel. And besides, nobody's going to steal a program from under my nose and get away with it. Please, let's talk this thing over calmly. I'm very calm, Mr. Kennedy, very! But I might remind you that if this station tries to double-cross me, my brother-in-law will pull his RaiCo program right out of this station. Very well, for the time being you go on with your Symphony at Dawn. I see, I don't happen to be lucky enough to have a rich brother-in-law, but I know the sign-off signal when I hear it. I'm glad everything's been settled so amicably. I knew you'd see it my way. I didn't see anything your way! And like an elephant, I never forget. Now you get out of here. - Get out of my office. - Why... Come on, outside. I showed him... he... Oh... oh! - Mr. Smith. - Yes? Well! What, again? - Yes. - Elmer. Elmer! Yes, Mr. Smith. Don't tell me. This is getting monotonous. Hey, we're forgetting Beverly. Turn on the radio, Andy, maybe she's on this morning. That Lewis guy couldn't contaminate the air two days in a row, could he? This is Vernon Lewis presenting for your pleasure Symphony at Dawn. Why don't somebody get some chloroform and dip some drops on that drip's mike? We will start this morning's program off with Tosti's Good-bye. And you'll end up with the same tune, brother! Beverly couldn't have overslept two days in a row, could she? No, she's too ambitious. I tell you, there's something rotten in Denmark. Well, maybe there is. But first we've got to find out about Beverly. We'll take care of Denmark later. Are you kidding? If you ask me, it's a pleasure not to have to listen to her. Nobody's asking you. Andy's got a pass. I think it's up to him to find out what's wrong. You've got a pass too, why don't you find out? You gave her the idea of calling her program Reveille, didn't you? - Well, I don't see what... - Hey, look! Since the two of you both know her, I appoint you as a committee of one to represent us. All those in favor say Aye! Good. - There you are, sir. - Thanks a lot, Mr. Lang. Now just forget all about Lewis. Well, good day, sir. Oh, Mr. Lang, there's one thing we haven't settled. We haven't decided on the number of times... ...you want Lang's Chocolate mentioned on the broadcast. I don't care if you never mention it. All I want to do is make a lot of pals happy. And a certain young lady. I can't tell you how much I miss you boys at camp. And I'm selfish enough to hope that... you might be missing me. Here's a record that I'd be playing for you if I were still greeting you at Reveille. He's one of my favorite singers. Frank Sinatra. Singing one of my favorite songs. Night and day. # Night and day # # You are the one # # Only you beneath the moon # # And under the sun # # Whether near to me or far # # It's no matter, darling, where you are # # I think of you # # Day and night # # Night and day # # Why is it so # # That this longing for you # # Follows wherever I go? # # In the roarin' traffic's boom # # Or in the silence of my lonely room # # I think of you # # Day and night # # Night and day # # Under the hide of me # # There's an oh such a hungry yearning # # Burning inside of me # # And its torment won't be through # # 'Til you let me spend my life # # Making love to you day and night # # Night and day # # Night and day # # Under the hide of me # # There's an oh such a hungry yearning # # Burning way down inside of me # # And its torment won't ever be through # # 'Til you let me spend life # # Making love to you # # Day and night # # Night and day # That was like a breath of old times. It's nice getting back with you fellows. And I miss those letters. There's a place down the road for people who talk to themselves. Besides, there's a gentleman waiting to see you. Oh, yes, Mr. Kennedy, is there something I can do for you? - Um, yes, I'd like some records. - Oh, perhaps a concerto? Oh, no, I want something hot, one that'll give you the hives. - Oh, you mean jives. - Jives, yes! Jives... - Are you feeling all right? - I never felt better in all my life. But you used to prefer the classics. Oh, no, no, I want something that'll put you in the groove, rather solid, through the gate. Classics are off the cob, in shallow water, they're icky... Icky? - Yes, icky. - Sure. Everybody knows the majority of people prefer Freddie Slack to Beethoven and, um... Bob Crosby to Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn, yeah! Mendelssohn... If you're through being funny, Mr. Kennedy, I'll go back to my work. No, wait, Beverly, I have great news for you. You're going back on the air again Monday morning. Back on the air? With a raise, a sponsor and twenty-six weeks guaranteed. - Am I hearing things? - Good things for you. But what is Mr. Lewis going to do? Mr. Lewis knows what he can do. And that goes for his woodwinds too. Come on now, get your hat, let's go. - Oh... Mr. Smith! - Yes? I've got my job back at the studio, Mr. Smith, and this time it's for keeps. I've got a contract. Oh, Mr. Smith, I know you'll understand, and... ...I'll give your shop a plug on the air, Mr. Smith. Oh, gee, thanks for everything and... You've certainly been swell to me, Mr. Smith and... I'll never forget you. Well, goodbye, Mr. Smith and, oh... Mr. Kennedy, this is Mr. Smith. - Hi, Mr. Smith... Kennedy... - Oh, charge them, Mr. Smith. Charge them, Mr. Smith, charge... Elmer. - Hello, Andy. - Hello. Come on in. Gee, I'm glad you came. - You're just in time for dinner. - Swell. - Say, Beverly... - Where's Barry, isn't he with you? - No, why? - I want to thank him for what he did. - What he did? Say, look, Beverly... - Haven't you heard? He sponsored my show. I'm guaranteed at least twenty-six weeks. - Isn't it marvelous? - Yeah, yeah, that's fine... Look, Beverly, there's something I've got to tell you. What is it? Well, before Andy... Barry and I met you, um... We made sort of a bet. Oh, about my being funny-looking. You told me about that. No, no, it wasn't that, it was about, um... people having money. I don't understand. Well, in simple words, Beverly, I am not... Oh, excuse me. - Barry, I'm so glad you came! - Hello, Beverly. - Hello. - Hello. Oh, Barry, how can I ever thank you for what you did? You've just made me the happiest girl in the world. Well, you're making me feel pretty good too. - But what's it all about? - Oh, isn't he sweet? He spends thousands of dollars and makes believe it's nothing. Yeah, he's too modest. Thousands of dollars? Oh, look. During the course of the day I make out so many checks... Which one are you talking about? - Oh, Barry... - Hello, boys. Mr. Lang, we don't know how to thank you for what you've done for our Beverly. Thanks, Mr. Lang. - Great guy, huh? - Whatever it was, it was nothing. Nothing? To spend all that money to sponsor Beverly's program? I only hope she lives up to your expectations, and I know she'll try. Hiya, fellas! For me? Gee, thanks! This is my other daughter Evelyn that I told you about. - Hi. - She's a riveter in an aircraft plant. - She is a little jumpy, isn't she? - Yeah, I do shake a little, don't I? I'm sorry. Hi! Oh... excuse me! Well, so long, folks, gotta keep them flying. - Bye. - Goodbye. Maybe that's an alert. Hello? Oh, yes, dear. It's Eddie. What's that? Oh all right, dear. Goodbye. Eddie says for us to go ahead with dinner, he'll be home later. So I guess we'd better get started. Might as well. Come on, son. - Oh, my goodness. - What's the matter? It's almost midnight. Oh, that's all right. I don't have to be back to camp before tomorrow night. But I have to be at the station early tomorrow morning. Sunday? Well, I have to straighten out my records and rehearse my program and... Well, after all, you want me to be good on Monday morning, don't you? My first day for Lang's chocolates. Well, I hate to do it, but... if I must, I must. - Oh, Barry! - Barry? Uh... Barry's ready to leave, Andy! Good night, Beverly. And good luck Monday, we'll all be rooting for you. - Thank you, Andy. - Goodbye! - Good night, boys. - Good night, good night. Oh, here comes Eddie. - Hello, guys. - Hello, Eddie. - What does the other guy look like, Pop? - There he is. - Well, good night. - So long, Eddie. Good night, boys, good night. How are you, beautiful? Say, Pop, you'd be in a fine fix if there was an alert now. Oh, I never thought of that. Get me out of this. - I'll run up and get your room ready, dear. - Thanks, Mom. Say, Barry's got you tied up better than one of his boxes of chocolates. Barry? You mean Andy, don't you, the fellow with the moustache? - Well, you pointed at Barry. - I always thought his name was Andy. No, the guy with the moustache, the one that bandaged you... ...was Barry Lang, the chocolate king. The other guy is Andy Adams, his ex-chauffeur. - Are you sure? - Hm? Are you sure? Why, sure I'm sure. Oh, I see. She's on! Good morning, boys, this is Beverly. Yes, I'm back, and I'll be here at the same time every morning... ...as long as you and Lang's Chocolates want me. Hey, you guys sure did a swell job getting Beverly back on the air. Nothing to it, nothing to it. Well, you know, enough talk... Good morning, Maggie. I'll never be able to broadcast, I'm all out of breath. Seems you're out of luck too. Why, you... Come on, let me in! Just a minute, boys, my records are a little mixed up. Cow-Cow... Have you got a passkey, Maggie? No, but I got a letter came early this morning for you. - Special delivery. - Oh... my fans writing in again. Greetings! Is something wrong, Mr. Lewis? I'm drafted. God bless America. We'll open our program with a number that stopped Ferdinand the Bull... ...from smelling flowers and sent him chugging on down to the bullring. In fact, the entire country is cow-cowing to Freddie Slack and his Cow Cow Boogie. The vocal is by Ella Mae Morse. # Out on the plains # # Down near Santa Fe # # I met a cowboy # # Riding the range one day # # And as he jogged along # # I heard him singing # # A most peculiar cowboy song # # It was a ditty he learned in the city # # Ah, comma ti, ii, yi, aay # # Comma ti, yipply, yi, aay # # Get along, get hip little doggies # # Get along # # Better be on your way # # Get along # # Get hip, little doggies # # And he trucked 'em on down # # The old fairway # # Singing his cow cow boogie # # In the strangest way # # Comma ti, ii, yi, aay # # Comma ti, yipply, yi, aay # # Singing his cowboy songs # # He's just too much # # He's got a knocked out western accent # # With a Harlem touch # # He was raised on loco weed # # He's what you call # # A swing half-breed # # Singing his cow, cow boogie # # In the strangest way # # Comma ti, ii, yi, aay # # Comma ti, yipply, yi, aay # # Get along little doggies # # Better be on your way, your way # # Get along, little doggies # # And he trucked 'em on down # # The old fairway # # Singing his cow, cow boogie # # In the strangest way # # Comma ti, ii, yi, aay # # Comma ti, yipply, yi, aay # # Yip yip, singing his cowboy songs # # Yip yip as he was juggling along # # Yip yip, he sings with a Harlem touch # # Yip yip, that cat is just too much # # Singing his cow, cow boogie # # In the strangest way # # Comma ti, ii, ii, ii, ii, aay # And now, before proceeding with the next number, I have some very good news for all you boys in camp. In response to your many letters, I've received commission to visit various camps in person... ...for our broadcast and do some shows. - Hey, that's swell, huh? - Hey, maybe we can get a date. Beverly... in... poison. 2 day at... - 4:30. - What's that? Beverly in poison? Beverly in person. Say, what's the matter, can't you guys read right? Hey, today at 4:30. I'll bet you she's coming here to see me. It wouldn't enter that thick skull of yours that she might be coming to see me. Now wait a minute, I'm still head man there. I can just see her now asking me up on that platform. - As the guest of honor. - Yeah, well if you get on that platform... - Hey, wait a minute. - What's the matter? - She can't see either one of us. - Why not? - Because you lied to her. - I lied to her? - About our names. - Now wait a minute, you're the one that suggested we change our names. Nevertheless if she calls you Barry and me Andy in front of this gang, she's going to find out that you're me. I mean, that I'm not you. Well, anyway, what's she going to think? - Well, that's not good, is it? - Hey, fellas. - How do you spell "admission"? - A-D-M-I-S-S-I-O-N. Thank you. Hey, Eddie, I wonder what happened to Barry and Andy. I don't know. - Hi, fellas! - Hi, Beverly! This is Beverly, a little late for reveille, coming to you from KFEL and broadcasting from camp. I want to thank Colonel Humphrey for sanctioning this broadcast. Take a bow, Colonel. And now I want to present to you... ...two boys who are responsible for me being back on the air. It gives me great pleasure to present... Privates Barry Lang and Andy Adams. Take a bow, fellas. Oh, boys, I'm sorry, and friends of my radio audience, but... I will be unable to present my two friends at this time. I've just received the following note, quote: Dear Beverly, sorry we could not attend your broadcast... ...as Barry and myself have just contracted a severe case of mumps. But we will be listening. Signed, Andy Adams. Unquote. Boys, I'm so sorry to hear of your sudden attack. And may I wish you a speedy recovery. But as soon as my broadcast is over, I'm certainly going to pay you a visit. Mumps or no mumps. How do you like that? That was something. That was a very brilliant idea of yours... ...sending her that note telling her we had the mumps. I had to make up some sort of an excuse for us not being there tonight. What's the matter, couldn't you spell pneumonia? And now to start the show off right, you've heard them on records and you're to meet them in person. Four men and a guitar, The Mills Brothers. - Hiya, fellows. - How are you, Miss Beverly? - Hiya, fellows, hiya, gang. - Hi, Mills Brothers! # Now, if you meet a suntanned lady # # Full of life and hidey hadey # # Big brown eyes, a little bit shady # # That's Sweet Lucy Brown # # Boys in town are dyin' to meet her # # Millionaires line up to greet her # # There ain't no gal in Georgia # # Sweeter than Sweet Lucy Brown # # When she talks she sure sounds funny # # Yowzer, mister # # When she kisses it tastes like honey # #I don't mean maybe, she's a pretty baby # # Listen fellows I'm confessin' # # Take a tip and stop your guessin' # # If it's love then take a lesson # # From Sweet Lucy Brown # # Oh, Lucy # # Oh, Lucy Brown # # Oh, Lucy # # Oh, Lucy # # Oh, Lucy Brown # # Oh, Lucy # # Oh, Lucy # # Oh, Lucy Brown # # Oh, Lucy # # Ain't no gal in Georgia that's sweeter # # Than Sweet Lucy Brown # You boys should have reported on Sick Call this morning. Much pain? Get away, doc... You boys will have to keep warm. Very warm! In fact, the colonel's gonna make it good and hot for you! Come on! This was your idea, writing this letter about the mumps. And now, while they're setting up backstage, and to avoid a load to our radio listeners, I have a big surprise for you. The two boys who weren't able to appear earlier in the program are here. They rose from their sickbeds just to make this appearence... ...and are probably facing a relapse in order not to disappoint us. So here they are in person, mumps and all, Private Barry Lang and Andy Adams. If what you say is true about them changing their names, I bet you... Shh! Watch the fun. First I want you to meet the sponsor of my program. Barry Lang. Let's give him a great big hand. - Well, what's the matter? - That's not Barry. - That isn't Barry Lang? - No. - Then who is he? - That's Andy Adams. - Well, then who is this? - Barry Lang! Boy, is she fixing them. Well, you people listening in are probably wondering what this is all about. Frankly, I'm wondering too. Perhaps one of you can explain. Well, what's so funny? You! That's the juiciest case of mumps I ever saw in my life. Ladies and gentlemen, for reasons beyond our control, we will be unable to continue with this interview. And now those imitators who cannot be imitated. Those boys of a thousand voices... ...who flew all the way from New York just to be here with you boys. The Radio Rogues. Come on out, boys. - Hiya, fellas! - Hiya, fellas! Hiya, there! Ladies and gentlemen, this is John Nesbitt speaking for radio's Passing Parade... and bringing to you now the Irish minstrel boy Martin Downey. # Wabash moon keep shining on # # The one who waits for me # Ah, you see, he's suffering, hmm. Say, did you ever come home... and wish that you had a fresh cigarette... ...wrapped in cellophane, did you, hm? Well, why don't you go out and buy some? # Tell her how I'm pining # # Keep on shining # # Wabash moon # Dear, dear, good evening ladies and gentlemen. This is the old mouse trap, bad birdie and all the lads, so help me. Priorities, ladies and gentlemen, priorities. The good maestro coming to you for good old miracle beer. Yeah? Now listen, slug, there's only one guy around here that brings beer, you understand? And that's me. The minute somebody gets shot around here you guys get tough... ...and start knifing each other. Now go on, scram, will you? And now, fellows, here comes that lovable character, your old friend Uncle Ezra. Come on in, Uncle Ezra! I got it, young fella. Hello, everybody. This is the powerful little firefighter in coal's county. And now, before you give me a two-time tooting on me, I've brought with me a couple of pals of mine from Pine Reeds, Lum and Abner. Come on in, Lum. Well, thank you, Uncle Ezra. Howdy, everybody, this is Lum that's doing the talking to y'all. And I'm right mighty proud to be down here tonight. Well, good for you, Lum, good for you. Time, 7:15, brought to you in person, Amos and Andy. Giddyup. Hello, this is the taxicab driver called Amos Jones speaking. And who is that on the telephone, Amos? Well, um, lad, where is you going, where is you going, son? Mother of kingfish, I done going down to the drugstore... ...to get 10c worth of achromatic spirits of pneumonia. Ah, you's doubled the guzzard. Agua, agua, agua... Quite so cupcakes, cornflakes, um... Now, everybody, I'd like you to meet a man you all love. You all know him, Clark Gable. Come in, Private Clark. Yeah, give it 'em, baby. Yeah, come on in, Scarlet. There's no reason why you shouldn't have a nightcap... ...just because I'm ill-bred enough to be at home. Sit down. Now, don't give yourself any airs. I know you drink and I know how much you drink. Do you think I care if you like your liquor? And by the way, honey, How does it feel, my pet, to have the woman you hate cloak your sins for you? Good night, Scarlet. And now, ladies and gentlemen... Halle, Hallelujah... The originator of the original quiz shows, the one and only Professor Whiz. - Is that correct, Professor? - Absolutely correct, absolutely correct. And now my first contestant. Over here, young man. Why... - Why, who are you? - Wouldn't you like to know. - Well, I certainly would like to know. - Let's not get nosy, bub. Oh, Red Skelton, eh? Not Red Skelton? Then who are you? I'm a bad boy. Oh, Lou Costello. Now, Lou... You know what a football is. You know what a basketball is, and you know what a baseball is. Now... What is a golfball? What is a what, Professor Whiz? What is a golfball? Well, Professor Whiz, a golfball is something a man chases when he gets too old to chase anything else. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is Don Wilson speaking from Los Angeles, California, and taking you now direct to New York City in Madison Square Garden. And the winner... and still greatest heavyweight... # When the moon comes over # # The mountain # Hello, everybody. And now, folks, on my next program, I'm going to sing a song dedicated to Emperor Hirohito. I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you. Taps when sounded means that it's time to go to sleep. We now present a new form of taps. One I'm sure will keep you awake. # Thumbs up for victory # # Soldiers and soldiers fight side to side # # Forever together # # And never say nigh # # Marching along to the beaches of France # # For the sake of a swell of a swell of the land # # All for the love of the USA # # Thumbs up and V for victory # # On land or sea for victory # # Ten million Yanks # # From Schenectady to Kalamazoo # # To Kokomo are ready to go # # Let's keep old glory in the sky # # Our Yankee rainbow riding high # # Roll up your sleeves and help the gal # # Who carries a torch to hold his heart # # Whatever befalls # # America calls # # Thumbs up and V for victory # On the land!

They've been ordered out, honey, but we must continue on as though nothing has happened. I hope Beverly knew we were moving and not just walking out on her. Now I hate them Japs worse than ever. I wonder if she's still on the air. This is Beverly continuing our broadcast from camp. Hm, that girl's solid. Trust her to not to let anyone on the outside know we're pushing off. Before I present the next number, I have a personal message for Barry and Andy... ...if you're still listening. Please don't think I'm angry about the little joke you played, because I've known for a long time which is which. And Andy, you didn't have to pretend. Because all the money in the world couldn't have made you any sweeter. And Barry, I think the same of you as I do of Andy. Just remember that... wherever you go, I'll be thinking of you. All right, you men, fall in outside. Come on, make it snappy. Let's go, fellows, come on. Because I love you both. And both have a raincheck on love. # On land or sea for victory # This is Beverly saying goodbye. # Ten million Yanks # # From Schenectady to Kalamazoo # # To Kokomo are ready to go # # Let's keep old glory in the sky # # Our Yankee rainbow riding high # # Roll up your sleeves and help the gal # # Who carries a torch to hold his heart # # Whatever befalls # # America calls # # America calls #
