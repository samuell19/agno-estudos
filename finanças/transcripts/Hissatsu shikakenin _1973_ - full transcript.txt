A SHOCHIKU PRODUCTION "Some people have described us as oddities, but we like to think of ourselves as artisans, men doing their job as honestly and fairly as they know how. But it's a secret trade. And you won't find any handbooks on it, for we are the purveyors of death. The Professional Killers." You know my secret work, so I won't elaborate. But even if I accept the job... I'll kill only the ones who harm people and society. A woman? Yes a woman this time. That's Dr. Baian's job. Tough for me too. I hate to see women's eyes when they die. Shall I ask you, Doctor? Will you do it? Yes. All advance 25 ryo. Thank you. You're next. Yes, please. I'm short of money these days. DR. BAIAN FUJIEDA, ACUPUNCTURIST What is it so suddenly? I'd like you to help me again. A killing. I'd feel easier having you with me. Who're you marking? Oteru, 2nd wife of Bunkichi, a wholesale candle merchant. Woman? When? I'll take a look tonight. Oteru. Oteru. Oteru. Kill that fine woman? A pity.

Doctor! Baian! Good morning. Your hip? Thank you. It doesn't hurt now. Naturally. Best acupuncturist in Edo. Only in Edo? Say the best in Japan. It's true! My head feels dizzy. Good morning. Doctor! Good morning. I told you not to smoke! Die if you can't mind me! I didn't smoke... Father! I'm sorry I wasn't careful enough. I'd let you if it's a terminal disease! But you'll get well! I understand! Show your face then. I'll throw this away! A jewel in a rubbish heap. A swine fathered a pearl... She gets prettier every day. She's no good. Why? She's in love already. Hurry, on your belly! Undress! Dr. Baian's late. Yes... he is. Doctor. I made you wait. Helping myself. Smells good. Oh, Omon-san. A light in your eyes. Make love yesterday? You're horrid! Same old doctor. Baian-san, who is he? Oh, I'm sorry. Don't worry. Senzo's my leader's young man. He's a glutton like me and followed me here. No, no! Don't cook it so long. It'll lose all its taste. How was it, Toku? I've been staking out Tsujiya's place. Oteru always was a cautious woman. Always...? Do you know her? Yes. I wasn't sure at first. Her father was a thief in Sunpu. I heard she'd become a geisha. How'd she get into Tsujiya? She got help? - She did? - A thief's help. She finds a place in Tsujiya's home... Then when the time's ripe, she helps her friends break in? Eat quietly! She acts as their guide? Betrayer? Yes. I know what you're thinking. You'll kill Tsujiya to get all his money. What's it to you? What's that? Father marked Tsujiya's place first. You were only his man. You've become some woman. Money means more than my husband's life. Don't think you can betray your friends and live, Oteru. Thieves aren't my friends now! I'm Bunkichi Tsujiya's wife. Fool! You don't hog it all! Be too persistent and you'll die. What's that? Killers can be hired with money. Bitch! Your order. Please! Enjoy yourself, Magohachi. Oteru! What's the matter, Oteru? Oteru, get a hold of yourself! Excuse me. What happened? She fainted! A doctor...? Oteru! What am I to do? This is bad. Her heart's stopped beating. It's very bad. HANYEMON OTOWAYA EMPLOYMENT AGENCY A perfect job. I was impressed. Heart failure? Now, my store is safe. I'm ashamed. Infatuated with a young woman. I almost lost all my fortune. To think she was the tool of thieves. By the way, this case won't leak out, will it? We'll never talk about our work until we're safely in our graves. The money. Toku. I hope we live a long time. Yes. Think we will? I don't think so. You don't? It wouldn't be right for killers to live to a ripe old age. But we can't take baths unless we're alive. Only a bloody pond in Hell waits for us when we die. Dr. Baian. To tell the truth I'm the one who killed Oteru's father. Otozo of Sunpu was a face among the thieves. He was a man who brutally killed even women and children. Finally, I couldn't stand it, so me and my friend did it. By a strange coincidence. I had a hand in his daughter's death. She paid for her father's sins. It often happens. Toku, I had a sister too. My mother, a slut, took her away from me. I was 7 then. Rain was pouring down. Dad, a blacksmith, died suddenly. Then Mom ran off with a man she'd been intimate with. I was left behind all alone. I'd been given only one riceball. With Mom like that, I wonder where my sister is and what she's doing. If she's alive, she'd be about 30. I hope she's not like that Oteru. I feel I'll die suddenly. Enough of gloomy talk! Bed down with country geisha? No. I'm tired. Dr. Baian, you have fun. You don't say. Women are the best cure for fatigue. Don't joke! I'm the guest here. I'm sorry but it feels so good. Of course I'm one of Edo's best. A masseur? A masseur? That's cruel. They say blind ones are best but you're good. That place. Harder. No, I'm the one who pays! Through? Enough. Who is it? Dr. Baian? Tokujiro, it's me, Magohachi. I didn't know you help assassins. Magohachi! Pretty good. Killing during flower viewing. I thank you for killing Oteru. This woman lied to me. She had to die, anyway. I was out to kill her too. But you broke our thieves' code too. I can't overlook your killing our boss. No! After your bath! Don't be stingy. You owe it to me. Toku! Toku! Toku, what happened? Dr. Baian, Magohachi... Magohachi? We killers can't live long... Toku! It's you? I startled you. I'd like to ask your advice. Please, please. Acupuncture' and moxa are about all I can do but tell me. A drink. Thank you. About 3 days ago. I was hard up. So I thought I'd win some money. At the Yabu bath? I'm in a pinch. No chance at all? I guess I'll lose again. That does it! Stop it! Don't touch another man's sword! Be still or I'll kill you! Can you do it? What? You... Take another bath. Was it my turn to play? I declare. You're strong, aren't you, samurai? I'm stronger in chess. It seems Mineyama Matajuro, a petty officer, was watching me. What happened? Like to be an officer at Hatchobori? At Hatchobori? I've been watching you. A waste not to use your strong right arm. I'll recommend you. A city constable? If you like, I'll help you. Need money though. Money? Money to my superior and to me for recommending you. It's 30 ryo. That's a lot of money. You'll get it back. More money comes in than you think. I see. A city constable? I'm ashamed to say I'm drawn to the offer. I understand. Ours isn't the kind of work a decent man would do. Losing a good friend. I've been depressed too. And you've a wife and children. Dying alone's one thing but your wife would follow you. That's it. It may be time for you to start a new life. If I become a constable. I'd have to arrest Otowaya and you. I'd kill you first. He's a fine man to recommend another man. No, he's after the 30 ryo. Petty officers are wolves on the scent of money. More women now? Only one more. Don't overdo it. Hard on me. The Magistrate's office is very strict. Think of my position, things to smooth thing over. So we pay you salve money. Not enough! Ten ryo a month isn't enough. Too many places to smooth over. But we make so little money. I'm not just shutting my eyes to this brothel alone! I pretend not to notice any illegal business. Ten ryo's too small a price. Isn't it so? Talks like this make you sick? No, he's been sick all along! Are you all right? Officer. I'll call later. Please accept this today. Heiju's right-hand man all right. Take care, Boss! Don't sleep here! Let's go home! Be sensible, Tamekichi! A filthy business, so Mineyama blackmails you! Why did you pay him, Magohachi? Are you a San-no-Matsu man? Let's go, Father! What's a night or two here? This is his home too! Please. That old man won't last long. Her medicine's slowly working on him. After he dies, trouble's bound to crop up. Please heip me then. Rubbing out Tamekichi? Don't do it too openly. Sometimes, I'm forced to act. Please. - Business good? - Yes, thank you. Thank you, Young boss. Business picking up? You gave us space that's almost too good for us. Not at all. Vendors living here are entitled to it. Thank you. Father, I... I know. Hurry. You scare me today. Don't worry. I want Father to retire. Then I'll take over his territory. Wait till then for our wedding. Father doesn't know in out he'll be killed by Okichi. Killed? Yes, she was a farmer prostitute. She's waiting for him to die! Young Boss. Young Boss, your father! Father? Shoten... What is it? I wanted to talk to you alone... Is Officer Mineyama Matajuro still alive? Mineyama, what about him? Father! Tamekichi? You listen too. I asked a man named Otowaya Hanyemon to do away with Mineyama Matajuro. Kill him? If I let him live. I'll lose everything I possess to him. After I die, he'll latch on to Tamekichi. When I think of it... Don't talk about dying! I know best about myself. Remind Otowaya Hanyemon for me. Tell him to do it without fail. Please help the San-no-Matsu Family and Tamekichi. Don't worry! We're sworn brothers! Trust me! Tamekichi, you're young yet. Work with Magohachi, mind Uncle, and take care of my territory... Father! Boss... Why did you leave me behind? Magohachi, he trusted you till the last. I'll back Tamekichi too. So you help him and protect the San-no-Matsu territory. Is that so? The Boss of San-no-Matsu passed away? His request? Request? About Officer Mineyama Matajuro. Heijui and I were sworn brothers, so he told me everything. Is that so? He wasn't in a hurry, he said. I was thinking of getting on with it. I'm sorry. No, no. You do it when you are good and ready too. I understand. But... Peace won't return to his territory by killing Mineyama Matajuro alone. Meaning...? On the side, he ran a brothel and gambling den. As long as Magohachi is in charge of them... There'll be bloody trouble in that territory. Magohachi? I know him. I myself have a request now. Please rub out Magohachi. It's not for Tamekichi's sake alone. I don't want bloodshed in the Shitsya-Ueno area. How about it, Otowaya? Here's 50 ryo. Please add my request to that of Heiju's. Senzo! Is Senzo around? Excuse me, please. BLADE POLISHER SANAI NISHIMURA Daisuke, be quiet! Your father's working! Daisuke! Never mind. Let him have fun. I'm going out. To the bath again? To deliver a razor. Playing chess again? Haven't made up your mind yet? Am I lucky. It's not chess but becoming an officer. The money... I'm out of work... 30 ryo is a large sum. Even a Pawn can become Gold. I see. Money can be made? Pardon. It's no time to play chess. What? Work. Work? Don't look back. Get the man you're playing chess with. What? That man? He's pretty strong. Be careful. Your wife? Fine, thank you. Is it true? No needles yet. Say so when you use the needle. If you don't. I'll bite my tongue, so... Finding the right place. You're taking a long time. Not yet? Be quiet for a while. Understand? Look after him. Work! Work! All big children now? Not teasing me? It's true. I really love you. Woo me then. Hard to woo a woman a man loves. Right? I don't love em. They love me. How nice! Dr. Baian, you always come here before work? Yes, I yearn for a woman before a job. I'm upset, I guess. Just a look tonight? The sooner the better. Tonight, if I get the chance. We've always been Bosses. The Shitaya-Ueno area was ours since Grandfather's time. So what? I intend to discard all our sidework. Discard? Close down the brothel and gambling den in your charge! I don't mind but can you get along then? What? Can the 23 men of the San-no-Matsu Family eat? Dr. Baian, this toilet. Fool! Be quiet! - I'm telling you, Boss Tamekichi. - What do you mean? Closing the side work means closing everything. Why? Others eye your Shitaya-Ueno area territory. Without sidework and with fever men, your territory's wide open. You don't know our code! We Bosses aren't thieves! What are you... I know all about you, Magohachi! You worked for Otozo, a thief! I see. So he's Magohachi? He's Magohachi? All right. I'll watch and see if you can handie such a big territory. If you'll excuse me... Follow him. If you don't want to starve, follow me! Well...? Dr. Baian, no need to hurry so. He killed Toku. He must die! He went into a bad place. A big party, I bet. Want to play with prostitutes? I'll say! I'm so busy! It makes me dizzy! You're too brusque-like a boy. Be more lady-like. I'll be right back. Poor service. Dr. Baian. Dr. Baian. No woman? There Magohachi. He's alone? Kill him? Yes! Oh! What? I saw her before! She's the late Heiju's widow? They're lovers? That's why Magohachi came straight back. How'd Tamekichi find out about my past? He'll find out I killed his father too. Let's send him to his father. You're a bad woman. Were both bad. I can't help it. It's the bad seed in me. Bad seed? Men made my Mother suffer but she couldn't be without them. As soon as Father died, she left Brother and me to elope with a man. It was pouring rain. I cried and ran after her, so she took me. Nothing good followed. Deserted by the man, she hid she had me and became a prostitute. Bad seed all right. A prostitute's daughter a prostitute. Your brother? I don't know. The same blood runs in us. He's bad too? Your home? Fujieda is Sunpu. Having fun. Too far away to hear them. They'll begin? Say, that's not fair. If I don't get a woman, I'll burn the place! She's a bad woman. How did Heiju's widow sink so low? Funny, Is it a sty? Peeked too long. Joking? Making love all night. Couldn't work. Should've pierced him with your needle. Don't get mad. Have to be patient. It's not work for short tempered men. I'd turn it down. I'm not bragging about it, but I hate the sight of blood. How about this then? Stop! Stop it! Dr. Baian, I feel sick! My superior will see you. See me? The sooner the better. When it? Don't rush me. You're different! Any other man would jump at the offer. I imagine so. I have my reasons. You don't really know us. Come with me! We don't depend on our pay. Gifts of money from merchants. We eat with that. Piled it pretty high? There's a law about it! If it falls and hurts people? Taking them away. Hurry. I'm Officer Mineyama. Tell the head clerk. The clerk will call tonight. It's mutual aid. Hurry, please. This one? Or this one? Go to it! Stop it! You're San-no-Matsu men! Are you crazy? Who said to do it? It's me. I did. Stop your jokes! The Magistrate knows my territory! Isn't it a mistake? Stalls are forbidden except on holidays. I've been lenient but I'll be strict from now on! No more stalls. Clear them away. You're one of us! Seikichi! How can you...? Fool, trying to defy an Officer of the Law? Be glad you won't be hung! You're back? What's that? Preparing for your return to service. Forget it. I'm better off now than as a corrupt officer. Uncle said he'd put up the 30 ryo for you. Decline it! Daisuke, what happened? You're a boy! Don't cry! Like a doll made of mud. Get in! Hold still! Hold still! Tamekichi. Magohachi? Why're you looking so grim? Trouble? Where's Magohachi? What is it? You two...! So you're lovers? Yes. Even in your father's days. When he was alive? You've nothing to do with this place now. Get out. No! What's the idea of those punks? Father's man once and making stallmen suffer! Aren't you ashamed? Leaving me without a word! What's funny? Very young yet. Sleep with one of my women and you'll grow up. Remember it! Circular letters? I can't pardon Magohachi and Okichi! I'll send circular letters to the Bosses! Uncle, please help me! The code of the Bosses isn't as strict as it once was. Better do away with them without others finding out? Okichi too? I wouldn't say in passing, but both would be better. Both of them? No man likes killing women. And it's twice in succession. I won't insist, I could ask someone else. What is it? I'm only lucky in killing women. Needles are best when it's a woman. It's not so messy a job. I'll try then. You will? Which one first? They're always together. Raining hard. What's up? Gambling tonight. Today? At Magohachi's secret den in Yushima. I see. That means Okichi will be all alone tonight? Horrid rain. Tama! Tama! Anyone see Tama? We can't look after cats. Can't even look after men! Keep it tied. Tama. Tama. Tama. Tama... Is it your cat? Thank you. Cats hate the rain. We took shelter together. I'll take you an umbrella. Don't brother. I'll return her to you. Thank you. Stay if you like until the rain stops. It looks as if it'll clear up soon. I'll stay a while then. I came to see a patient and it began to rain. You're a doctor? Yes, an acupuncturist. I see. I'm sorry but I hate acupuncture. You haven't tried it, that's all. It doesn't hurt. It's the best thing for women's ills. Is that so? You're anemic and like warmth even in summer? You can tell? If you suffer from dizzy spells and insomnia. Acupuncture eases the blood flow. You'll feel better. Really? Then shall I ask you...? Is your husband away? Yes, he... Won't he scold you for letting me in? Don't worry. He'll be late. You've had a hard time, haven't you? I've been examining patients many years. I can tell how they grew up. The gambling? Cancelled. I intended to go. No one came due to the rain. Next time. Tama. Don't go outside. It's raining. You love it very much? Cats are more affectionate than people. I've been fooled by people. The cat's my only friend. True Tama? Many things happened? Since a child, I never had a real family. A hard life? I didn't have a family either. I see. But you became a fine doctor. I'm a former prostitute. A big difference? Excuse me. Where were you born? I've forgotten. I see. I grew up trying to forget the filth. I think I understand how you feel. Don't look so grim. It hurts? Just a second. Not long enough to feel it. Then... I feel we could get along, you and I. Come to my shop. I'll show you some women. Excuse me. Rare for you to do that. Yes. We'll watch. Go ahead. Doctor. It's you? Phony Doc. What? He's a killer, Okichi. Don't pretend, I know you're a killer. Who told you to kill Okichi? Don't know a thing, do you? What? Pull my tongue out, we never talk. Kill me and be done with it. I know Tamekichi asked you to do it. Take my advice and see a good acupuncturist. Or you won't last long. Stubborn fellow. Want to die? I'll do it. Not here. Men who don't pay at brothels are dumped into the river. Well, let's here. Proceed. Damn! Dr. Baian! Somebody! Somebody! Help! Help! Help me! Dr. Baian! Dr. Baian! Dr. Baian! Somebody! I can't swim. I can't swim. Officer Mineyama? A must see him tonight! Where is he? I'd rather not say. Tell me or you'll get hurt! Officer Mineyama? He's not, here... I was told he's here. What is it so late? I thought I'd better give you my answer today. You've no delicate feelings? Of course. And what? Not here. All right. Go to bed first. How far are you going? I'm sorry. I decline your offer. Why so? I'm not suited to the job. Don't regret it later. A talk tomorrow. There is no tomorrow. What? You won't be alive tomorrow. It's sudden but I want your life. You're drunk? No, I'm sober. You harm people and society. Draw. Draw your sword. Not so much! Easy, easy. Careful fool! It's rare for you to fail. But for me, he'd be fish bait. What? What's that? No, no, but... Women aren't my forte. It seems a pity to kill even a bad woman. Your bad fault. What? You're a fine swimmer. More? By the way, Doctor... I know. Tonight. That's rash. No, I'm ashamed – I want to settle it tonight. Doctor, what happened? Your face! I got into a fight. Bring sake. Not with your wound! - I want you. - Doctor... That's why I came late to see you. But... I can't suppress it. See how I'm shaking. I feel lost if you're not near me. That Tamekichi. Using a killer. You should've killed him sooner. Don't put it off. It's either kill or be killed. A fair tomorrow? Tamekichi's lucky to die then. All right. The rest of the money. Thank you for saving us bloodshed. That case has been settled. Please don't touch upon it again. Yes, I understand. I only wish for peace. Tamekichi can now succeed his father without any worries. Thank you. Father, spring has come to my territory. Please rest in peace. I'd like our wedding to be on the 3rd of next month. I regret you can't see Oyuki as a bride. I'll ask Uncle to act in your place. Ah, Young Boss. - How's Uncle? - Waiting for you. - I'm coming in. - Of course, please. On the 3rd next month? You've become a real Boss. My congratulations. Pamper me once more by acting in Father's place at the wedding. I can not. Then Father can rest in peace. Please. I'm deeply indebted to you. I'll make it up to you little by little. Don't be stingy. Do it all at once. I'll take over your territory. What's that? I'm taking your father's place. No complaints? You plotted it all along? Yes. I paid a lot to killers. You haven't grown up yet if you didn't know it. Joking? Think the Bosses will let you? I've talked to them already. A lie! That's ridiculous! It's too late to fuss now. Do as I say. It's best for your own sake. Damn! You won't get that territory even if I die! Bury him in the mountain in back. Take over Heiju's territory. Since he's dead and his son has vanished, we've no objections to it. But cause no trouble over it. If you can't handle it, it'll be taken away from you. Thank you. I'll take charge of the territory in place of Heiju. Please favor me with your help. Serve food. Please be comfortable. Boss. - A guest? - Yes. Who is it? He brought over a gift. - Gift? - Yes. O, Otowaya. You took over the San-no-Matsu territory? My congratulations. How did you hear about it? Bad news travels fast. I have grapevines to fill me in about news like this. We assassins rob a person of his one and only life. So we succeed only when we and guests strictly observe our code. You fooled me. Follow your victim in accordance with our code. Wait, I'll pay you all you ask! I don't want money! I want your life! It's best to forget past work. Even if Daigoro fooled us, 3 rascals vanished from the earth. Didn't they? Your words make me feel easier. That woman... Woman? The memory of her eyes when she was dying still clings in my mind. Her eyes looked exactly like my mother's when I was abandoned at 7. She mentioned her filthy past. Could she have been my sister? When I think of it, I can't sleep. You just imagine it. Such a thing couldn't happen. Probably not. I agree with you. But just perhaps... Work followed work recently, so I'm tired. I hate to talk about work now, but... It was a job I couldn't turn down. I'm sorry to ask you... That's cruel. I meant to go to Izu and wash away the stench of blood. It's a terrible world when we assassins can't even rest. Isn't that you Minoya? If it isn't Otowaya. Having fun? A little fun. He's our next man. THE END Subtitles by: Kofka aka DenPryan Jidai-Geki Buyer's Club
